mr.
ben
neidlinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
honorable
court.
i
think
in
the
first
place,
it
might
be
well
for
us
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
as
attorneys
for
the
respondent
in
this
case,
we
are
actually,
although,
technically
representing
the
sheriff
of
lucas
county,
ohio
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
neither
mr.
friberg,
as
prosecuting
attorney
of
this
county,
nor
i,
as
one
of
his
assistants,
were
interested
in
nor
did
we
partake
in
the
case
involving
the
longshoremen's
union
and
the
two-leader
terminal.
we
came
in
to
the
matter
when
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
were
filed
originally
in
our
court
of
appeals
and
have
then
in
the
matter
ever
since
that
time.
i
say
that
this
not
in
apology
for
our
position
today,
only
an
explanation.
now,
the
chronological
order
of
this
matter
might
become
important.
let
us
remember
that
in
the
first
place,
this
petition,
that
is
the
petition
for
an
injunction
and
equitable
relief,
was
filed
on
may
the
27th.
that
is
the
day
that
the
temporary
order
was
issued.
now,
i
will
read
just
a
moment
from
the
record
because
i
believe
that
we
have
a
little
misunderstanding
here
possibly
as
to
what
was
requested
in
that.
on
page
11
of
the
record
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
item
number
12,
the
prayer
for
relief
set
forth
for
plaintiff
phrase
that
pending
final
hearing
and
determination
of
the
issues
herein,
a
restraining
order
be
issued
forth
with
against
the
defendants
and
each
of
them
etcetera.
on
the
next
page
at
the
bottom,
just
above
the
attorney
for
the
plaintiff,
plaintiff
further
phrased
that
upon
final
hearing
said
restraining
order
be
made
permanent,
so
much
for
whether
or
not
a
restraining
order
was
asked
in
issue.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
that
is
our
opinion,
your
honor.
the
distinction
made
between
a
restraining
order
and
an
injunction
is
not
always
so
very
clear
in
our
state.
i
may
say
that.
i
may
say
the
words
are
used
quite
loosely
and
quite
interchangeably.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
it
does
not,
your
honor
but
i
will
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
well,
as
i
believe
and
as
i've
said
it
to
the
court,
those
words
are
quite
loosely
and
quite
interchangeable
in
ohio
practice.
now,
i
may
also
say
that
i
disagree
quite
strongly
with
counsel
when
he
has
said
to
this
court
that
it
is
not
the
practice
to
issue
temporary
orders
ex
parte.
i
would
say,
and
mr.
friburg
agrees
with
me,
that
in
our
experience,
which
encompasses
together
about
65
years
of
practice
in
that
county,
that
it
is
very
common.
perhaps
it
should
not
be
your
honors
but
i'm
telling
you
what
it
is.
and
the
custom
and
the
practice
is,
and
our
objection
in
this
case
is
that
the
petitioner
now
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
did
not
go
into
court
and
do
what
all
other
lawyers
do,
immediately
file
a
motion
to
dissolve
that
injunction
to
have
a
hearing
on
it.
that's
the
crux
of
our
matter,
your
honor.
that's
a
crux
of
it.
he
didn't
do
that.
he
chose
his
own
method.
he
chose
his
own
method
and
he
did
not
choose
the
method
which
the
court
himself
suggested
to
him
as
i
would
show
you.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
mr.
green
agrees
with
me
that
a
formal
order
was
not
important
but
on
the
petition
and
on
the
docket,
an
order
either
temporary
injunction
or
temporary
restraining
order,
i
don't
know
which
granted
has
paid
for.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
no,
probably
not
only
on
the
petition
but
also
upon
the
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
--
the
docket
sheet
of
the
court.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
and
that
is
all
no
formal
journal
entry,
is
that
correct?
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
defer
to
mr.
green
in
that
matter
because
he
was
in
that
case
and
i
wasn't.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
ben
neidlinger
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
record.
you
prepared
the
record
mr.
green.
is
it
in
the
record?
mr.
ben
neidlinger
it
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
last
until
--
he
either
two
--
one
or
two
things
happened.
either
it
was
dissolved
like
further
order
of
the
court
or
made
permanent
by
further
order
of
the
court.
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
it.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
unless
as
is
the
practice
a
motion
to
dissolve
it
were
filed.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
you
have
filed
a
motion
to
dissolve
and
have
a
hearing.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
what
kind
of
notice?
well,
usually
simply
advise
other
counsel
and
set
a
date
for
a
hearing
of
it
which
is
usually
heard
very
rapidly
on
a
date
to
which
is
convenient
to
the
counsel
for
both
sides.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
no,
your
honor.
that
is
a
statement
by
my
learned
counsel.
he
said
he
couldn't
hear
in
such
a
hurry
and
that's
why
i
wanted
to
get
to
the
chronology
of
the
events
and
show
you
the
holidays
that
intervene.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
no,
we
hear
them
--
we
hear
them
in
our
jurisdiction
almost
immediately.
he
would
have
had
no
trouble
hearing
it.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
no,
your
honor.
notice
would
have
to
be
given
but
the
court
would
set
it
up
and
would
not
broke
any
delay
in
hearing
a
thing
of
that
kind
anymore
that's
necessary
but
the
calendar
when
something
has
been
said
here
earlier
this
morning
about
some
five
or
six
months,
i
say
to
--
to
your
honors
categorically
that
that
is
not
true,
would
be
heard
within
five
or
six
days.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
your
honor
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
our
concern
some
30
years
of
practice,
i
have
had
my
share
of
experience
with
injunction
orders
both
on
one
side
and
on
the
other.
we
never
had
any
difficulty
on
having
a
hearing
on
a
motion
to
dissolve
any
type
of
temporary
order
within
the
time
of
satisfactory
for
both
counsel.
i
never
heard
such
a
thing.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
that
is
a
question
i
cannot
answer.
and
i
only
can
say
that
i
wasn't
--
and
should
perhaps
have
been
prepared
for
that
question
but
i
again
remind
you,
your
honors,
that
we
did
not
participate
in
that
case.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
if
there
are
any
papers
that
this
court
wants,
we
have
within
our
power
to
get
them
to
him,
we
will
do
so
immediately.
you
are
now
talking
about
to
make
a
specific
--
actually,
we'd
better
mark
it
down,
mr.
friberg.
the
--
the
copy
of
the
petition
itself
if
it
has
any
notations
on
it
by
the
court,
am
i
correct
your
honor?
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
and
also
any
returns
from
the
sheriff
showing
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
--
who
of
any
received
them.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
very
happy
to
get
them
for
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
well,
your
honor,
we
are
now
talking
about
two
--
two
different
things.
the
justice
was
referring
to
the
order
in
the
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
--
civil
proceeding.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
you
are
now
proceeding
--
referring
to
some
things
that
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
--
were
said
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
--
the
counsel
about
that.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
think
you
will
find
that
all
of
the
record
relating
to
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
are
in
the
printed
record
in
chronological
form.
we
examined
this
record
and
we
agreed
that
those
things
happened.
yes,
there
was
a
definite
order
given
to
the
sheriff.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
but
as
long
as
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
but
as
long
as
we
are
now
on
that
subject,
perhaps,
i
should
correct
something
which
has
been
said
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
--
about
this
dragging
off
to
jail.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
important
or
not.
but
the
hearing
on
june
7th,
1960,
now,
that's
a
hearing
on
contempt.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
on
the
contempt
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
june
7,
1960
mr.
ben
neidlinger
it
was
at
10:30
a.m.
it
was
comparatively
short.
it's
in
the
record,
however.
and
the
record
will
also
show
in
chronologically
events
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
issued
and
the
petitioner
released
immediately
afterwards
at
11
a.m.
i
just
say
that
to
this
court
so
that
you
may
not
get
any
notions
from
what
has
been
said
by
counsel
that
the
petitioner,
who
is
one
of
our
own
brother
at
the
bar,
languished
in
our
local
bastille.
here's
--
custody
was
entirely
a
technical
one.
and
i
also
want
to
point
out
some
thing
else.
there
is
not
a
thing
in
the
record.
and
if
there
is,
i
haven't
been
able
to
see
it
and
i
took
this
case
through
both
of
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
to
indicate
that
he
asked
for
or
was
refused
bond
by
the
trial
court.
it
was
a
little
more
quite
summary.
you
are
in
contempt.
i
find
you
so
much
and
so
on,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
asked
for,
it
was
denied
bond.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
before
anything
could
happen,
they
were
all
prepared
and
they
were
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
one
floor
up
with
the
writ
habeas
corpus
and
it
was
signed.
he
was
released.
now,
those
are
the
facts
and
counsel
knows
it.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
that
that's
a
--
i
think
that's
exactly
the
point.
we
had
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
where
was
it
committed?
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
think
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
think
it
was.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
your
honor,
well,
bear
with
me
just
a
moment.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
no,
your
honor,
he
did
not.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
outside
of
the
court's
premise.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
without
for
one
moment
admitting
that
this
man
did
not
have
a
hearing
on
june
7th,
which
i
will
advert
to
later.
i
would
say
that
when
on
the
june
1st
and
the
june
3rd,
he
stated
in
open
court
in
unequivocal
language
that
he
had
not,
as
counsel
says
in
his
brief
and
orally,
advise
his
clients
that
in
his
opinion
the
injunction
or
restraining
order
as
it
may
be
was
invalid
because
of
lack
of
jurisdiction,
but
that
he
deliberately
advised
him
to
disobey
that
order,
told
the
court
he
advised
him
to
obey
that
order.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
of
course.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
your
honor
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
well,
let
us
see,
your
honor,
what
just
--
what
the
petitioner
did
say
to
the
court
before
i
attempt
to
answer
your
question
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
--
which
i
may
add,
just
put
in
a
way
that
makes
it
extremely
difficult
for
me
to
answer.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
the
record
--
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
referred
to
your
cases
and
i
will
answer
your
question,
your
honor,
to
the
best
of
my
ability.

of
the
record,
the
fourth.
now,
mr.
green,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
“i
had
only
two
ways
to
go
at
it,
let
me
say
this,
that
this
court
had
no
jurisdiction.”
the
court,
“that
is
beside
the
point.”
mr.
green,
“and
consequently,
a
contempt
on
the
basis
of
any
own
valid
order
cannot
stand.”
mr.
green,
“well,
it
is
not
beside
the
point.”
mr.
ben
neidlinger
what
date
was
this?
mr.
ben
neidlinger
no,
your
honor,
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
this
--
this
is
a
transcript
to
the
proceeding
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
you
were
wrong
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
actually,
the
indirect
proceedings
were
filed
on
june
6th
and
the
hearing
was
on
june
the
7th,
the
previous
hearings
on
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
well,
i
think
it
does
have
quite
a
bit
of
bearing
on
the
charge.
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you.
may
i
proceed?
on
june
the
1st,
these
were
--
this
was
said,
“you
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
of
the
record
page
24,
continue
where
i've
been
reading
your
honor.
“you
could
at
least
obey
the
order
of
the
court
and
then
come
in
and
expressed
whatever
criticism
you
had
and
put
yourself.”
mr.
green,
“there
were
only
two
ways
we
could
do
these.”
the
court,
“you
could
wait
until
we
had
a
final
hearing
on
the
entire
matter.
that
was
the
only
way
you
could
have
done
it.
you
could
obey
the
order
of
the
court.”
mr.
green,
“no,
we
could
not
have
done
it
that
way.
then
my
client
would
have
to
give
up
the
only
vital
right
to
have
to
bargain.
the
only
other
way
the
--
this
matter
could
have
come
up
is
the
way
it
did
come
up
that
is
by
a
contempt
action
in
this
court,
because
this
is
the
only
way
this
matter
could
have
been
heard,
etcetera.”
and
then
at
the
top
of
the
next
page,
finishing
the
sentence,
“and
it
was
apparent
that
this
court
had
made
a
court
order
that
was
invalid
on
its
face.
that's
been
his
contention
all
along.
the
court,
“but
that
was
before
it
was
ever
submitted
in
the
court
who
did
that.”
mr.
green,
“well,
sure,
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
about
that.”
then
there's
some
--
some
more
and
then
later,
after
he
says
“i
can
advise
that
they
were
told
by
me”,
which
he
now
claims
his
advice.
and
if
it
his
advice
may
i
say
to
your
honors
that
of
all
that
this
petitioner
did
was
advised
his
clients
that
in
his
opinion,
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction,
we
want
it
distinctly
understood
to
this
court
that
we
believe
he
would
have
been
acting
within
his
rights,
not
only
within
his
rights
that
he
would
have
been
his
duty.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
he
said
so
and
his
counsel
said
so.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
he
said
so.

green,
ii,
his
counsel,
merritt
green,
at
that
time
asked
for
and
was
granted
permission
to
read
into
the
record
what
he
would
have
testified
too
if
the
court
would
have
heard
him.
that
was
granted
and
he
read
at
alumnus
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
it's
heard
in
the
court.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
no,
the
court
heard
it.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
well,
that's
what
happened.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
well,
i
--
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
what
--
what
your
honor
means
by
hearing
it.
i
assumed
that
he
listened
to
it.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
didn't
hear
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that
is
correct
mr.
ben
neidlinger
at
page
36
of
the
record,
mr.
green,
whom
i
now
beg
the
indulgence
of
the
court
again,
calling
your
attention
that
this
is
now
mr.
green
senior,
counsel
from
mr.
green
junior
as
he's
very
statements.
and
then
beginning
at
the
middle
of
the
page
36
and
going
on,
he
relates
his
in
--
the
entire
reference
but
in
the
words
of
the
now
petitioner
in
this
case
everything
that
he
would
have
testified
too
had
even
permitted
to
testify,
that
is
what
was
heard.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
that
was
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes.
the
court
certainly
was
there
at
that
time
as
far
as
that
was
concerned
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
things
in
mitigation.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
say
that
the
language
used
by
this
man
in
the
court
on
june
the
1st
and
on
june
the
3rd,
in
my
estimation,
had
the
court
wish
to
stand
upon
his
rights
as
finding
him
guilty
of
direct
contempt
could
have
done
so.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
well,
i
refer
to
a
number
of
places.
on
june
the
1st
when
he
says
that
he
could
advise
the
court
now
that
the
pickets
had
been
told
--
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
have
to
refer
to
my
brief
on
that
page
25,
i
regret
doing
so,
but
i
could
find
it
quicker.
the
record
its
page
23,
when
he
asked
the
respondents
of
the
union,
officials
had
been
told
by
someone
to
valid
the
court
order.
he's
answer
was,
“i
can
advise
now
that
they
were
told
by
me.”
then
the
court
later
on
said,
“you
could
wait
until
we
had
a
final
hearing”
which
i
read
before.
that's
on
record
24.
he
said,
“no,
we
couldn't
have
done
it
that
way”
and
told
why.
at
june
the
3rd
and
the
resumption
of
the
same
session,
he
used
the
language,
record
page
27,
“you
also
advised
them
to
violate
an
order
of
this
court”.
now,
petitioner
on
the
same
page
said,
“i
did”.
at
record
28
of
the
lower
half,
he
state
to
the
court,
“your
honor,
i
have
taken
the
only
course
open
to
me
referring
of
course
to
advising
these
pickets
to
violate
the
injunction.
but
i
don't
feel
that
we
are
contempt
to
court.”
and
then
he
said
these
significant
words
your
honor
to
a
judge
of
30
years
experience
on
the
bench,
“i
don't
want
to
discuss
that
at
this
time.
i'm
not
concerned
with
that
at
all.”
now,
i
say
it
then
and
there
say
in
that,
that
language
coupled
with
the
other
taken
that
way
that
he
was
indirect
contempt.
and
even
though
the
court
shows
whether
wisely
or
wisely
to
granting
a
further
hearing
on
june
the
7th,
i
don't
think
he
had
to
do
so.
i
think
the
conduct
of
the
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
your
honor
and
the
question
before
this
court,
if
your
honor
would
respectfully
bear
with
me,
is
also
as
to
whether
or
not
substantial
justice
has
been
done
to
this
man.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
tried
to
your
honor.
i
don't
quite
over
succeed.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
justice
brennan's
question
i
think
was
whether
he
heard
it.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
think
the
justice's
question
as
to
whether
--
as
to
whether
he
heard
it.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
your
honor.
and
as
i
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
it's
a
difference
as
to
whether
he
considered
it
too,
your
honor.
i
recognized
that
quite
well.
but
i
was
not
in
the
entire
conformity
with
what's
you
are
meaning
when
you
asked
the
question.
i
would
not
mean
to
be
facetious
in
my
answer.
i
assure
you
your
honor,
that
he
had
--
i
--
i
shown
it's
a
matter
of
foursquare
and
not
have
be
(inaudible).
if
your
honor
presents
the
question
directly
to
me
as
to
whether
he
thinks
--
whether
i
think
that
the
court
had
his
mind
made
up,
that
what
had
happened
on
june
the
1st
and
on
the
june
the
3rd
in
the
presence
of
the
court,
and
also
what
had
happened
outside
of
the
court,
what
was
admitted
by
counsel,
i
mean
admitted
by
the
petitioner
and
also
by
his
counsel
and
that
therefore
his
mind
was
made
up
for
all
practical
purposes
before
he's
heard
the
statement
of
mr.
green,
i'll
answer,
yes,
i
think
it
was.
wish
to
be
as
fair
with
the
court
as
the
court
is
with
me.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
it
would
not
be
the
type
of
hearing
which
i
would
advocate
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
(voice
overlap)
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
do,
because
of
the
other
things,
which
courts
have
related,
and
because
of
the
fact
that
since
there
is
no
question,
no
question
at
all
from
the
record,
no
question
at
all
that
this
man
repeatedly
informed
the
court
in
brash
terms,
and
i
used
the
term
“brash”
not
to
characterize
the
petitioner
in
anyway
but
because
it
happens
to
be
the
terminology
used
by
the
ohio
supreme
court.
when
he
told
the
court
brashly
that
he
not
only
had
advised
them
to
disobey
an
order
of
the
court
but
in
effect
told
them
that
he
was
going
to
continue,
he
didn't
want
to
hear
anything
about
what
that
was
contempt
to
court.
yes,
your
honor,
in
that
case
i
would
say
substantial
justice
had
been
done
and
that
therefore
he
had
a
hearing
within
the
purview
of
the
due
process.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
it
was
all
done
at
the
hearing
on
june
the
1st,
june
the
3rd
and
the
charge
of
june
6th.
i
don't
hesitate
in
order
to
get
the
chronology
correctly
on
my
mind.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
would
put
it
just
a
little
differently,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
--
i
can't
put
it
your
way
or
i
would
be
glad
to.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes.
i
would
say
that
where
a
direct
contempt
has
been
committed,
i
thought
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
we
think
so.
your
honors
will
decide.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
it's
just
what
i
was
going
to
get
to.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
don't
believe
he
should
have.
i
--
i
think
that
he
was
mistaken
in
filing
the
charges
of
indirect
contempt.
i
--
i
believe
that
--
that
i
know
judge
mckay
well
enough,
and
the
30
years
he
has
been
on
the
bench
and
happened
to
be
one
of
my
law
instructors,
law
school
long
before
that,
i
think
i
know
him
well
enough
to
say
that,
well,
he
may
have
been
somewhat
incensed,
if
i
may
use
that
terminology,
the
hearings
on
june
the
1st
and
on
the
june
the
3rd
of
this
young
man
of
three
and
a
half
years
experience.
his
counsel
says,
addressing
him
in
that
way
that
over
the
weekend,
that
he
cooled
off
or
somewhat
and
probably
decided
that
formal
charges
were
better.
he
did
say
at
all
times
that
he
wanted
him
to
have
counsel
before
he
can
sentence
him.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
and
i
believe,
and
i
told
the
ohio
supreme
court
this,
in
fact
an
answer
to
his
suggestion
i
believe
it
was
where
the
chief
justice
of
that
court,
that
long
sense
had
a
little
temperedness
have
been
displayed
upon
a
part
to
this
young
man,
to
this
man,
30
years
is
senior,
and
infinitely
he
is
senior
as
far
as
judicial
experience
is
concerned,
we
would
not
be
here
in
this
court,
and
he
would
had
no
need
to
be
here.
i
think
that
all
could
have
been
taken
care
of
by
nothing
with
an
apology,
a
statement
that
if
i
have
--
if
i
haven't
reached
myself
and
i'm
sorry,
my
intent
only
was
to
carry
out
my
duty
to
advise
my
clients
and
not
to
tell
them
not
to
do
something
which
the
court
had
ordered
and
we
wouldn't
be
here,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
he
was
offered
that
opportunity,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
it
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
think
the
court
could
very
well
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
think
the
court
could
very
well
do
that.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
well,
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
accepting
that
we
do
not
believe
that
if
the
--
these
were
only
a
charge
of
indirect
contempt
that
a
hearing
was
denied
to
this
man.
we
believe
that
he
did
have
a
hearing
and
answer
to
chief
justice's
question.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
evidence
introduced
against
him?
mr.
ben
neidlinger
only
the
evidence
of
the
record
of
his
previous
statements
on
june
the
1st
and
june
the
3rd.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
in
a
formal
way,
it
wasn't.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
in
accepting
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
the
statement
by
his
counsel,
statement
by
his
counsel.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
well,
not
exactly
but
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
if
your
honor
please,
although,
as
an
assistant
prosecuting
attorney,
i
do
represent
the
state
of
ohio.
we
are
not
contending
that
the
state
had
any
part
in
this
case
of
contempt.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
think
essentially
providing
statements
of
the
petitioner
himself,
coupled
with
his
attitude,
coupled
with
--
it
was
necessary,
the
corroborative
statements
of
his
counsel
at
the
hearing
on
june
the
7th.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
when
he
told
them
that
that
was
the
way
to
raise
it?
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
let
me
answer
that
by
reading
from
page
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
but
suppose
he
had
--
suppose
that
had
been
all
that
he
did,
what
would
you
say?
i
would
say
he
would
not
be
guilty
of
contempt.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i'm
--
base
mine
on
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
you
would
have
divided
that
into
two
parts
one
of
those
the
doctrine
(voice
overlap)
--
with
the
other.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
if
he
said
disobey
the
order
of
the
court
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
would.
and
i
will
tell
you
why.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
will
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
but
i
respectfully
suggest
that
what
you
have
said
is
a
non
sequitur.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
have
come
(inaudible)
believe
so.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
and
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
you
will
leave
me
at
then
nothing
to
your
question.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
will
say,
yes,
you
can.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
know
i'm
going
to
idem
to
plea
your
honors'
kind
permission.because
that
same
lawyer
knows
very
well
that
that
isn't
the
only
way
to
test
it,
that
the
way
to
test
it
isn't
in
irregular
method
by
filing
a
motion
to
dissolve
the
injunction.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
they
wouldn't
file
one.
the
record
clearly
shows
that
he
gave
us
his
excuse
for
not
filing
one
that
he
couldn't
give
a
hearing
soon
enough.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
well,
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
answer
your
question
and
not
get
into
that
for
a
moment.
and
the
reason
i
answered
your
question
the
way
i
did
is
because
this
lawyer,
inexperienced
as
he
may
be,
nevertheless,
knew,
if
we
give
him
credit
for
all
the
other
things
that
he's
supposed
to
have
known,
that
he
examined
the
law,
they
decided
that
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
a
state
court
was
debatable
where
the
nlrb
was
involved
etcetera,
all
of
which
is
covered
for
the
brief.
if
you
knew
all
those
things,
he
also
knew
that
the
proper
way,
and
he
shows
it
in
the
record,
that
the
proper
way
was
to
file
his
motion
and
have
a
hearing
and
dissolve
that
injunction
in
the
regular
way.
therefore,
it
cannot
follow
that
he
told
his
client
that
the
only
way
that
they
could
do
it
was
by
violating
the
injunction
and
tell
them
to
violate
the
injunction
because
if
he
told
them
that,
that
was
not
honest
advice
fearlessly
given
as
quoted
from
this
other
case
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
that's
why
i
say
this.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
answer
that
question
very
clearly,
your
honor,
if
he
honestly
believe
that
the
judge
wouldn't
dissolve
it
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
there's
no
right
to
assume
those
things.
he
has
no
motion
filed.
he
was
asked
to
file
a
motion.
he
gave
us
his
reason
no.
he
couldn't
get
an
early
enough
hearing.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i'll
find
it.
i
was
trying
to
find
it
in
answer
to
justice
at
the
same
but
--
but
it's
there.
alright,
in
record
43.
i'll
read
it
from
my
brief
and
then
find
that
with
reverence.
the
peti
--
and
then
impertinently
an
informal
discussion
between
the
trial
judge,
the
attorney
for
the
employers
and
the
petitioner
himself,
i
am
now
reading
from
my
brief
page
28
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
page
43,
lower
half
of
the
page.
and
i
quote
from
the
record,
“the
court
flatly
refused
saying
that
he
would
not
hear
the
motion
until
the
restraining
order
was
obeyed”.
i
may
say
apparent
that
if
we
are
--
i
think
the
court
was
certainly
within
his
judicial
rights
and
asking
this
restraining
order
to
be
obeyed
and
then
you
--
your
motions
dissolve
it.
i
then
ask
the
court,
that
if
the
restraining
order
was
obeyed,
would
it
be
possible
to
obtain
a
hearing
within
the
week
and
he
replied
that
it
would
not.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
that
means
that
he's
going
to
bargain
with
the
court.
if
he
can
get
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
--
an
early
enough
hearing,
he
is
going
to
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
they
didn't
tell
him.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
about
a
week.
said
he
couldn't
hear
it
that
week.
by
the
way
that
was
a
short
week
that
had
a
holiday
in
it,
started
on
a
tuesday,
four
days.
and
then,
the
dialogue
occurred
in
which
he
said,
“well,
then
you
could
come
obey
the
order
of
the
court.”
and
he
said
no,
“we
couldn't
do
that.”
mr.
ben
neidlinger
that's
correct.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
at
that
time,
your
honor?
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
indeed.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes
indeed.
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
as
to
that
--
your
interpretation
is
that
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
--
is
essentially
correct.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
no.
no,
i
disagree
with,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
that
is
not
quite
the
situation.
following
that,
he
went
out
and
he
advised
his
clients
according
to
his
own
statement
that
they
didn't
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
order
of
the
court.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
they
wouldn't
be
up
for
contempt
for
anything,
your
honor.
but
we
come
back
again
to
the
distinction.
was
he
--
should
he
tell
them
that
the
order
of
the
court
was
and
his
opinion
invalid?
mr.
ben
neidlinger
should
he
tell
them
to
disobey
it?
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i'm
afraid
i
don't
follow,
your
honor,
that
that
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
don't
think
i
quite
followed
your
honor
on
that
latter
part.
would
your
honor
repeat
it
for
my
benefit
please?
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i'll
appreciate
it.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
if
your
honor
is
correct
--
in
the
first
place,
may
i
respectfully
suggest
that
i
did
not
say
that
the
contempt
consisted
only
of
the
attitude
of
the
petitioner
plus
what
his
counsel
said
for
him
or
related
what
he
would
have
said,
had
he
been
permitted
to
testify
on
june
7th.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
also
couple
that
with
what
he,
the
petitioner
himself,
said
to
the
court
repeatedly
on
both
june
the
1st
and
june
the
3rd.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
that
is
the
--
that
sums
up
the
--
the
evidence
on
june
the
7th,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
i
finally
got
so
that
i
have
--
not
obtuse
as
to
what
your
honors
driving
out
as
i
was
earlier.
that
is
correct.
i
tried
to
answer
these
questions
as
frankly
and
thoroughly
as
i
can
when
i
understand
them.
there
was
no
hearing
on
the
contempt
except
on
june
the
7th,
1960.
what
your
honor
wish
to
elicit
from
me,
admission?
your
honor
has
it.
now,
may
i
resume
for
just
a
moment.
i
want
to
say
that
we,
as
well
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
our
district
and
the
supreme
court,
have
distinguished
and
continue
to
distinguish
between
dishonest
advice
fearlessly
given,
that
any
attorneys
considered
in
best
opinion
and
order
his
invalid,
and
that
therefore,
if
contempt
proceedings
are
based
upon
that
order,
they
will
fall
which
i
will
reiterate,
it's
not
only
the
right
but
a
duty,
i
believe,
that
when
attorney
so
advise
his
clients
and
the
out-announced
statement
to
proceed
and
go
ahead.
if
that
distinction
is
a
tenuous
one,
your
honor,
then
we
will
freely
admit
that
this
conviction
of
contempt
could
not
stand.
that
is
our
distinction.
i
wish
to
call
the
attention
briefly
and
i
will
not
take
too
much
of
your
honors'
time
to
page
52
of
the
record.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
the
record
in
which
counsel
for
the
petitioner
asked
to
make
these
opinions
so
far
as
the
record
and
they
have
been
made
apart
at
page
52,
and
in
--
he
--
in
re
(inaudible)
is
footed
these
words,
“in
the
ordinary
case
of
advice
to
clients,
if
an
attorney
acts
in
good
faith
and
in
the
honest
belief
that
his
advice
is
well-founded
and
then
the
just
interest
of
his
client,
he
cannot
be
held
liable
for
error
in
judgment.
the
preservation,
independence
of
the
bar
is
too
vital
to
redo
administration
of
justice
to
allow
of
the
application
of
any
other
general
rule.”
we
agree
with
that
100%.
further,
not
quoting,
it
will
not
be
questioned
that
the
petitioner
was
fully
within
his
rights
to
advise
his
clients
that
in
his
opinion,
a
comment
of
this
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
restraining
order
and
to
point
out
to
his
clients
the
legal
remedies
open
to
them
to
raise
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
and
i
may
say,
parenthetically,
i
mean
legal
remedies.
i
should
be
--
tell
us
--
i
think.
when
the
petitioner
went
beyond
advising
his
clients
as
to
their
legal
rights
and
that
the
order
of
the
common
pleas
in
his
court,
court
was
in
his
opinion
was
invalid
and
advised
them
to
violate
the
court's
order,
his
actions
in
so
advising
them
ceased
to
be
privileged
and
he
acted
at
his
parole.
on
page
54
of
the
same
opinion,
the
last
three
lines
of
paragraph
number
1,
the
petitioner,
his
attorney
for
the
respondent,
at
the
hearing
on
june
the
1st
and
june
the
3rd,
admitted
advising
them
to
violate
the
restraining
order.
now,
there
would
be
again
--
mr.
ben
neidlinger
that's
right
and
i
shall
proceed
to
the
supreme
court
now.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
and
i
shall
now
proceed
to
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
i
quote
that
as
an
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
not
because
it
is
binding
upon
your
honor
but
really
because
i
wish
to
make
our
position
wholly
clear
and
say
that
we
urged
that
argument
on
that
court
at
that
time
and
that
we
believe
in
it.
we
believe
in
it
then.
we
believe
in
it
now.
at
page
67,
the
1st
--
the
3rd
paragraph,
the
last
sentence,
“consequently,
an
attorney
who
brashly
advises
his
client
to
disobey
an
existing
court
order
is
in
contempt
of
court
not
withstanding
any
vulnerability
that
may
attach
to
such
order.”
further
down
in
the
next
paragraph,
“the
restraining
order
issued
on
the
petition
was
preliminary
and
temporary
in
nature
and
no
motion
was
filed
to
dissolve
it
nor
was
any
other
instrument
challenging
the
court's
jurisdiction.”
and
that's,
your
honors,
is
italicized
by
the
court
and
is
italicized
by
us.
i
see
by
the
light
on
the
(inaudible).
my
time
is
up.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
thank
you
your
honor.
i
have
i
believe,
if
your
honors
please,
only
about
three
minutes
so
i
will
attempt
to
summarize
what
i've
like
--
would've
like
to
say
at
greater
length
if
i
will
not
so
interested
in
asking
your
honor's
questions.
and
the
other
is
this,
we
do
make
this
distinction
and
we
stand
by
it
that
an
attorney
at
law
has
the
right
to
advice
his
clients
as
to
the
invalidity
in
his
opinion
of
a
court
order.
now,
when
he
goes
beyond
doubt
and
instructs
them
to
disobey
which
we
feel
the
--
the
record
will
amply
bear
itself
that
he
is
guilty
of
contempt,
that
the
hearing
which
he
had,
which
was
punctuated
your
honor
by
a
numerous
interruptions,
a
procedure
with
which
i
may
respectfully
suggest
your
honors
are
not
too
unfamiliar
was
not
conducted
with
the
decorum
which
would
--
we
would
have
chosen
but
we
do
believe
that
substantial
justice
has
been
done,
that
the
man
stated
repeatedly
that
his
counsel
stated
in
his
stead
repeatedly
that
he
had
advised
the
disobedience
of
a
court
order.
the
issue
to
us
your
honors
is
clear,
shall
an
attorney
who
believes
perhaps
in
good
faith
that
a
court
order
is
invalid,
use
the
regular
orderly
judicial
processes
and
attack
that
order
through
filing
a
proper
motion
and
asking
for
a
hearing
or
shall
he
take
it
upon
himself
to
determine
what
the
result
would
be
upon
that
motion
for
a
dissolution
of
a
restraining
order
and
that
the
rest
to
being
repetitious.
again,
i
repeat,
the
words
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
"rightfully
instruct
his
clients
to
disobey
that
order."
we
do
not
believe
he
can
do
that.
we
have
no
personal
feeling
in
this
case
or
whatsoever.
we
are
here
in
a
nominal
capacity
not
as
a
prosecuting
attorney
and
assistant
prosecuting
attorney
of
lucas
county,
ohio
but
merely
because
habeas
corpus,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
remedy
as
directed
to
the
sheriff.
we
have
no
better
start
with
this
young
man.
his
father
is
one
of
my
boyhood
friends
but
we
are
interested
in
seeing
that
lawful
orders,
lawfully
issued
are
either
obeyed
or
attacked
by
or
the
orderly
processes
of
law.
your
honors
have
been
very
kind
to
me
and
i
thank
you
for
your
indulgence.
thank
you.
mr.
ben
neidlinger
mr.
green
had
the
order
your
honor.

neidlinger
