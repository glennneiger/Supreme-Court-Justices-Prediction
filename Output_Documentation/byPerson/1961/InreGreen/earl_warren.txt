first
case
for
argument
is
number
312,
the
matter
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
merritt
w.
green,
ii,
petitioner.
mr.
green,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
trial
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
say
the
trial
court
denied
him
bail
on
appeal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
green
before
--
before
you
get
to
that,
i
wonder
if
you
couldn't
start
right
in
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
controversy
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
tell
us
--
tell
us
briefly
just
what
the
facts
were
in
--
in
succession
so
we
can
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice

in
our
--
our
minds.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
we've
got
everything
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
you
just
take
us
through
the
steps.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
terminal
date
fixed
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
--
i
supposed
to
look
further
only
to
the
court,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any,
in
ohio,
is
there
any
appeal
from
a
temporary
injunction
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
--
was
there
any
violence
in
the
picketing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that?
i
didn't
get
that
last
statement.
you
say,
might
have
said
that
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
said
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
when
you
say
refuse
to
release
him,
you
mean
in
its
final
opinion,
they
did
release
him
on
bail,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
had
it
on
hearing
before
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
it's
void
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
supreme
court
recognize
this
is
an
indirect
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
just
to
say,
mr.
merritt,
that
on
the
2nd
and
3rd,
whenever
it
was
that
it
was
agreed
between
counsel
that
the
way
to
--
the
way
they
could
get
at
this
thing
would
be
to
--
to
continue
the
--
the
picketing
and
--
and
taken
up
with
the
court,
isn't
that
(voice

about
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
counsel
on
both
sides
agreed
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
right
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may,
mr.
green.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
that's
--
that's
all.
thank
you.
mr.
neidlinger.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
your
contention
this
was
a
restraining
order
and
not
the
temporary
injunction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
long
was
this
order
whether
it
was
a
restraining
order
or
an
injunction,
how
long
was
it
to
last?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
conclusion
--
at
the
conclusion
of
the
main
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
what
is
the
procedure
to
dissolve?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
kind
of
notice
must
be
given?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
on
the
motion
of
that
kind
to
dissolve,
isn't
there
some
requirement
of
law
as
to
how
much
notice
a
person
is
entitled
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
it
might
not
have
any
trouble
but
isn't
there
any
--
any
statutory
requirement
as
to
--
to
what
notice
the
person
is
entitled
to
on
the
dissolution
of
an
injunction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
rather
--
rather
strange.
it
wouldn't
be
some
requirement
as
to
how
much
notice
could
have
be
done
without
notice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well
if
you
will.
do
you
know
if
there
was
any
order
to
the
sheriff?
as
i
understood
counsel,
he
was
in
court
and
--
and
asked
for
a
bond
and
he
said,
“no,
take
him
over
and
lock
him
up”
or
words
to
that
effect.
and
they
just
took
him
into
--
into
custody.
now,
was
there
an
order
or
written
order
after
that
to
the
sheriff
or
--
or
was
that
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
we
are.
chief
justice
earl

we
--
we
are
--
we
are
in
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
well,
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--talk
about
it
then.
you're
right
on
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
whose
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
date
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
niedlinger,
you
--
you
pointed
out
to
us
the
statement,
the
proper
of
proof
that
--
that
mr.
green
made
after
he
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
--
to
testify.
and
then
i
notice
there's
some
colloquy
at
the
end
of
that
to
go
this
way.
mr.
green,
“then,
i
don't
know
what
it
is
coming
to.
i
think
we
have
that
right
and
that's
what
we
have
done.
all
the
circumstances
arising
before
and
meeting
up
to
the
advice
of
this
lawyer
to
his
clients,
if
that
is
excluded
then
i
presumed
as
the
court
said,
it
has
decided
then
the
only
thing
here
today
is
the
question
of
punishment.”
the
court,
“that's
right.
at
last,
you
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion.
that's
all
is
before
the
court.”
and
then
mr.
green
says,
“this
thing,
apparently,
in
the
last
few
minutes
has
become
--
has
become
dangerously
close
to
--
to
generate
in
him
to
an
emotional
thing.
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
this
to
court
that
before
sentence
is
imposed
that
the
court
will
go
back
and
read
what
is
in
the
record
and
to
do
the
record”,
obviously
referring
to
his
offer
of
proof.
and
the
court
says,
“i'm
not
going
to
read
all
that,”
that
mr.
greene,
“i
will
just
going
to
make
the
suggestion.”
“you
may
make
your
suggest.”
the
court
has
previously
held
that
merritt
w.
green
ii,
is
in
contempt
to
court.
therefore,
he
is
ordered,
committed
to
the
lucas
county
jail
for
a
period
of
10
days
and
to
pay
a
fine
of
$500
on
a
stand
committed
until
the
fine
is
paid.
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
now,
my
point
is
simply
this.
in
the
--
in
the
light
of
that
colloquy,
how
can
you
say
that
he
considered
that
of
proper
of
--
of
proof
as
evidence
on
which
he
--
he
could
convict
this
man
with
anything.
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
think
that's
an
adequate
hearing
on
which
you
commit
a
man
to
jail
for
a
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
isn't
the
right
question
to
you.
i
asked
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
within
the
realm
of
due
process,
if
that
is
an
adequate
hearing
for
a
man
before
he's
sent
to
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
all
done
before
he
was
charged
with
this
charge
with
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
your
--
your
conclusion
is
that
in
the
mind
of
the
judge,
a
man
can
be
convicted
of
indirect
contempt
and
then
can
thereafter
file
a
complaint
against
him,
permit
him
to
offer
no
evidence
in
his
defense
and
find
him
--
him
guilty
on
his
state
of
mind
at
the
time
he
came
into
the
courtroom.
chief
justice
earl
warren
put
it
your
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
say
put
it
your
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
a
direct
contempt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
--
why
did
he
then
file
charges
of
indirect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
offered
that
opportunity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
here
--
what
evidence
was
--
was
introduced
against
him
at
the
hearing
that
you
say
he
had?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
was
that
presented
in
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
informal
then
tell
us
how
informally
it
was
done.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
counsel,
i'd
like
to
go
on
that
right
after
what
mr.
justice
black
has
read
to
you,
and
i'll
read
the
whole
paragraph
on
page
43,
this
is
folio
53,
“i
thereupon
told
the
court
that
i
had
a
motion
to
vacate,
prepared
and
would
gladly
file
it
immediately
if
i
could
obtain
an
early
hearing”.
the
court
flatly
refused,
saying
that
he
would
not
hear
the
motion
until
the
restraining
order
was
obeyed.
“i
then
asked
judge
mckay
that
if
the
restraining
order
was
obeyed,
would
it
be
possible
to
obtain
the
hearing
within
the
week,
and
he
replied
that
it
was
not.
then,
mr.
ragan,
whom
i
take
it
was
counsel
for
the
other
side
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
this
is
all
in
the
chambers
of
the
judge,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
mr.
ragan
then
suggested
that,
“as
an
alternative
that
i
agree
to
submit
to
the
court
the
four
signators
of
the
agreement
to
be
dealt
with
on
contempt.
after
some
discretion,
i
agreed
to
do
so
and
stated
to
both
judge
mckay
and
mr.
ragan
that
i
would
gladly
stipulate
all
matters
necessary
to
establish
the
contempt
so
that
i
could
immediately
appeal
the
decision
or
file
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
the
entire
atmosphere
of
the
meeting
was
light
and
agreeable.
and
i
was
convinced
that
both
the
judge
and
mr.
ragan
were
aware
that
i
had
consented
to
bring
them
in
before
the
court
and
stipulate
the
essential
matters
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
testing
the
validity
of
the
court's
order
and
his
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter.
so
far
as
i
was
concerned,
the
matter
was
clear
cut
and
the
hearing
the
following
day
was
to
be
short
and
to
the
point.
to
that
end,
i
prepared
the
necessary
habeas
corpus
proceedings.”
now,
does
that
sound
contemptuous
or
brash?
doesn't
--
and
doesn't
that
sound
as
though
he
was
honest
and
straightforward
with
the
court
and
told
him
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
--
and
with
no
objection
from
either
the
court
or
counsel
on
the
other
side?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
was
he
--
then
he
did
that,
didn't
he?
he
did
that
and
then
after
that,
he
was
--
he
was
committed
for
contempt
for
having
done
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
would
he
--
what
would
they
be
up
for
contempt
for
if
they
obeyed
the
order
of
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
says
right
here
that
--
that
mr.
ragan
and
--
and
the
judge
apparently
agreed
with
him
that
that
would
be
the
way
to
bring
it
up
speedily.
and
he
did
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
read
that
part
again.
here
--
here
we
are
in
the
judge's
chambers
and
the
counsels
for
both
sides
are
there,
the
judge
is
there.
mr.
ragan
who
is
counsel
for
the
employer
then
suggested
that
as
an
alternative,
as
an
alternative
to
--
to
a
hearing
to
--
to
set
aside
the
injunction
that
i
agree
to
submit
to
the
court
before
signators
of
the
agreement
to
be
dealt
with
on
contempt.
after
some
discussion,
i
agreed
to
do
so
and
stated
to
both
judge
mckay
and
mr.
ragan
that
i
would
gladly
stipulate
all
matters
necessary
to
establish
the
contempt
so
that
i
could
immediately
appeal
the
decision
or
file
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
the
entire
atmosphere
of
the
meeting
was
light
and
agreeable.
and
i
was
convinced
that
both
the
judge
and
mr.
ragan
were
aware
that
i
had
consented
to
bring
these
men
before
the
court
and
stipulate
the
essential
matters
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
testing
the
validity
of
the
court's
order
and
the
jurisdictions
of
the
subject
matter.”
now,
that's
--
that
is
uncontradicted
as
i
understand
it
on
the
7th
day
of
--
of
june
even
taking
your
own
view
of
it
that
this
was
some
evidence
that
--
that
would
amount
to
a
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
i
understood
it,
you
said
there
were,
on
the
7th
of
june,
there
were
no
witnesses
against
this
man
put
on
the
stand.
the
only
thing
that
you
rely
on
for
a
conviction
is
the
attitude
of
the
defendant
and
what
his
counsel
admitted
in
--
in
court.
and
--
and
that
--
that
was
sufficient
hearing
in
your
judgment
to
constitute
due
process
and
this
was
in
the
proper
of
proof.
you
having
stated
that
you
believe
that
this
was
some
representation
of
a
hearing.
now,
if
that
is
the
fact
and
there's
nothing
to
contradict
it,
where
is
the
--
where
is
the
brashness
in
the
contempt
that
you
speak
of?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
that
was
before
--
that
was
before
the
charges
were
filed
against
him.
did
he
say
anything
in
court
on
the
7th,
the
petitioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
so
he
said
nothing
and
all
you
have
are
the
statements
of
his
counsel
and
this
proper
recruit.
that's
--
that's
the
basis
upon
which
the
hearing
was
held
and
upon
which
he
was
convicted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
june
7th
was
--
if
--
if
there
was
a
hearing,
that
was
the
day
the
hearing
was
held,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
on
no
other
day.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
that's
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
52.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
(voice
overlap)
to
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
neidlinger
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
court
specifies
the
time
at
that
moment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
whose
statement
is
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
following
that,
came
this
colloquy
in
the
chambers
of
the
judge.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
neidlinger,
would
you
kindly
leave
either
that
order
that
you
--
that
you've
just
read
or
a
copy
of
it
with
the
clerk
desk
and
we
too
by
counsel,
either
one
--
we
don't
care
for
the
original
unless
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
i
see.
oh
would
you
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you'd
rather
use
a
copying
--
it's
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
if
