justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
saying
is
that
there
was
no
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
possible
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
friday
afternoon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
formal
appointment
at
the
time
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
agree
with
you
that
he
should
have
a
hearing
at
the
end
of
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
thing
he
needed
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
you're
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
proper
litigation
here
is
what
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand
this,
mr.
green.
i
thought
this
supposed
or
the
content
in
which
he
stands
convicted
was
having
advised
his
client
as
he
did,
is
that
what
his
contention?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
he's
not
himself
convicted
of
having
violated
any
order.
it's
only
for
having
given
advice
to
his
client,
do
you
think?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
gather
what
he
said
to
the
judge,
i
forgot
the
date
you
used,
the
1st
and
the
3rd
of
june,
when
the
judge
asked,
“well,
who
told
you
fellows
to
do
this?”
he
spoke
up
and
said,
“they
did
it
on
my
advice”
or
something
to
that
in
effect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
he
go
on
to
say
at
that
time
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
advice
that
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
did
not
find
the
four
guilty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happened
to
them
by
the
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
--
this
contemplated
only
two
kinds
of
orders,
what's
called
the
“restraining
order”
and
what's
called
the
“permanent
injunction”.
in
other
words,
this
doesn't
speak
in
terms
at
least
of
a
temporary
injunction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
sounds
to
me
--
it
sounds
to
me
whatever
the
label
maybe
more
like
a
request
for
temporary
injunction
that
it
does
for
what
i
understand
to
be
a
restraining
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
judge
said
he
couldn't
hear
anybody.
they
seem
too
crowded.he
couldn't
find
his
time
for
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
contempt
we
had
before
us,
isn't
it?
the
one
that
was
initiated
on
the
6th
included
on
the
7th?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
one
on
which
we
don't
have,
isn't
it?
so
what
had
happened
before
that,
except
it
has
a
bearing
on
that
charge,
is
the
only
--
only
relevance
he
would
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
heard
it
after
refusing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
would
let
--
he
would
let
the
witness
take
the
stand
and
lawyers
says,
“well,
this
is
what
he
testified
too”
that's
hearing,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happened?
is
that
hearing
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
not
the
question
before
us,
is
it?
that's
what
i'm
--
the
question
before
us
is
whether
the
conviction
in
fact
ended
up
content.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
the
question
was
whether
he
had
a
hearing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
hearing?
what
i
asked,
not
whether
he
heard
it.
he's
not
deaf.
i
supposed
he
has
heard
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
different
thing
from
whether
he
had
a
hearing,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
the
counsel
wasn't
a
witness,
was
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
did
the
state
pull
he's
case
in
other
words?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
but
how
one
of
the
state
either
than
that
--
how
was
the
case
for
contempt
pulled?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
that
colloquy
mr.
green
as
saying
that
he
actually
had
a
motion
to
dissolve
or
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
he
actually
had
one
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
of
--
of
--
well
he
couldn't
get
an
early
date
on
it
and
then
mr.
reagan
made
the
suggestion,
well,
set
it
up
or
make
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
last
thing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
--
was
this
--
any
of
these
things
that
t
the
state
relies
on
so
strongly
and
that
is
i
did
advise
and
so
forth,
these
all
happened
after
that
colloquy
in
chambers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
want
to
--
i
want
to
get
this
beneath,
taking
a
position
that
at
the
colloquy
in
the
judge's
chambers
and
the
fact
the
judge
agreed
that
the
weight
of
bringing
this
on
for
a
fast
hearing
was
to
have
them
violate
the
order
and
--
but
the
judge
understood
that
that
was
the
arrangement
that
was
to
be
worked
out
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
so
that
when
he
expressed
surprise
or
asked,
“who
was
it
that
advised
this
fellows
to
do
that
that
he
should've
known
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice

exactly
what
the
lawyer
is
going
to
do
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
his
chambers.
