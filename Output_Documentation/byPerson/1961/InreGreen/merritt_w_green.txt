mr.
merritt
w.
green
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
has
issued
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
this
particular
case.
petitioner
in
this
case
was
judged
to
be
guilty
of
contempt
to
court,
an
indirect
contempt
to
court
by
a
trial
court
in
ohio
after
a
written
citation
for
indirect
contempt
had
been
filed
by
a
court,
the
judge
of
the
court
of
common
pleas,
pursuant
to
provisions
of
the
ohio
statutes.
the
circumstances
out
of
which
the
citation
for
a
contempt
arose
or
the
citation
arose
out
of
the
petitioner's
representation
of
members
of
a
labor
union,
the
petitioner
being
a
lawyer
in
ohio
have
then
about
three
and
a
half
years
admission.
whose
members,
the
union
members
were
then
engaged
in
a
labor
dispute
with
an
interstate
employer
which
had
started
some
time
previous
to
that
time.
the
acts,
claimed
acts
of
contempt
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
where
that,
he
have
advised
his
client
who
really
was
the
original
counsel
in
chicago
that
the
court
of
common
pleas
in
this
labor
dispute
which
was
involved
in
interstate
commerce
had
issued
an
ex
parte
temporary
injunction
and
he
had
told
his
client
that
in
view
of
adamant
and
continuous
refusal
of
the
court
issuing
that
ex
parte
injunction
enjoining
the
continuation
of
pea
--
peaceful
picketing.
that
--
it
appeared
that
the
only
way
that
would
be
possible
to
get
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
the
conflict
of
jurisdiction
between
the
state
court
and
the
federal
court
would
be
if
the
union
chose
to
continue
picketing
and
the
court
entertained
a
citation
for
contempt
of
the
injunction
and
the
filing
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
jail
and
fined
$500,
the
maximum
amount
of
the
ohio
law
without
being
given
a
trial
or
hearing,
which
was
provided
for
in
the
statutes.
immediately
thereafter,
upon
the
refusal
of
the
trial
court
to
issue
or
grant
a
bond
so
an
appeal
to
be
taken,
the
petitioner
filed
his
application
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
immediate
appellate
court
in
ohio
and
the
original
action
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
seeking
his
release.
the
contention
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
--
at
that
time
of
the
petitioner
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes
sir,
that's
right.
immediately
on
pronouncing
sentence,
he
--
he
called
to
some
deputies
that
he
had
already
had
in
the
court
and
take
him
to
jail
and
refuse
to
issue
a
bond.
in
the
original
action
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
it
was
contended
--
three
things
were
contended
that
first
that
the
temporary
injunction
issued
prohibiting
peaceful
picketing
in
the
labor
dispute
arising
in
interstate
commerce
was
void
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter,
number
one.
number
two,
it
was
contended
that
the
--
the
lawyer
being
a
part
of
the
rights
given
to
a
legal
advice
and
that
the
use
of
a
lawyer
being
part
of
the
rights
given
to
people
who
are
in
labor
unions
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
so
forth,
that
the
denial
of
counsel
to
them
by
reason
of
this
type
of
an
action
and
the
--
and
the
refusal
for
these
or
the
sentencing
a
lawyer
to
jail
for
honest
advice
given
to
--
to
a
client
and
the
subsequent
refusal
to
give
him
a
trial
or
hearing
on
citation,
a
written
citation
for
contempt
was
the
denial
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
of
the
law.
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
he
just
said
at
the
outset
that
the
--
at
the
day
that
the
petitioner
was
summons
in
on
this
written
petition
or
written
charge.
after
some
difficulty,
we
tried
to
find
out
what
these
--
what
the
posture
of
the
case
was,
what
we
were
there
for
and
the
judge
finally,
we
--
as
the
record
would
show,
says
that
you're
not
here
for
any
hearing
or
trial.
the
trial
court
apparently
took
the
position
that
previously
on
two
separate
days
when
members
of
the
union
were
before
the
court
for
a
violation
of
the
injunction.
they
were
before
the
court
pursuant
to
agreement
made
between
counsel
and
the
presence
of
the
court
to
that'd
be
a
way
to
test
the
--
test
the
court's
order.
the
trial
court
apparently,
when
the
petitioner
in
answer
to
a
question
by
the
court,
“i
want
to
know
who
told
these
men
to
do
so
and
so
and
to
violate
this
injunction.
you
honestly
and
truthfully
told
the
court
that
i
can
tell
the
court
now
they
were
told
by
me.”
and
then
he
went
on
to
explain
to
the
court
that
after
the
continuou
--
continuous
denial
of
the
hearing
at
the
outset
an
issuance
of
the
ex
parte
injunction,
that
he'd
called
his
client
in
chicago
and
said
to
the
people
in
chicago,
now
here's
what's
happened
today
and
even
though
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
this
was
at
the
first
hearing
where
the
men
were
in
for
--
on
contempt
and
that
the
petitioner
was
not
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
this
was
the
contempt
of
the
--
of
the
union
people.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
i
can
bring
that
on
the
focus.
for
instance,
the
men
were
in
to
answer
the
citation
for
a
contempt
of
the
injunction
on
june
1st.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
june
1st
hearing
or
in
the
june
1st
hearing,
let
me
say
this
first,
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
men
on
the
1st
and
on
the
3rd
of
june
and
then
on
the
7th
of
june
is
when
the
petitioner
was
summons
in
for
hearing
on
his
alleged
contempt.
the
--
the
charge
of
contempt
was
filed
against
the
petitioner
on
the
6th.
but
on
--
in
the
--
on
the
hearing
of
the
1st
during
the
hearing
of
the
men
is
when
the
judge
after
they
had
stipulated
what
had
taken
place
so
that
as
there
was
agreement
the
day
before
in
the
judge's
office.
let
me
go
back
that
far.
the
--
when
we
went
in,
they
--
they
talked
about
this
and
the
(inaudible)
of
the
other
side
said,
“why
don't
you
bring
these
four
men
in
who
were
not
pickets.
they
were
--
they
weren't
even
on
the
picket
line.
they
have
been
officers
of
the
union.
and
then
why
don't
you
stipulate
and
then
we
can
--
and
if
the
court
finds
him
guilty
then
you
can
immediately
file
your
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
get
them
out
to
test
this
jurisdictional
question
on
the
federal
preemption
of
question.”
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that
took
--
the
hearing
--
what
do
you
mean?
the
--
the
--
where
the
judge
in
--
in
the
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that
was
on
the
31st.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
that's
in
--
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
well,
to
--
the
7th,
that's
in
the
--
in
the
hearing
of
the
june
7th.
that
is
in
the
offer
to
prove.
when
the
trial
court
denied
the
petitioner
the
right
to
testify
and
just
said
there's
going
to
be
no
hearing
or
trial
and
they
want
to
put
the
petitioner
on
so
he
could
relate
what
took
place
as
--
as
his
proviso
of
statutes.
he
refused
that
and
then
we
read
into
the
record
the
offer
to
prove
in
which
the
petitioner
related
this
whole
thing
right
from
the
beginning
to
the
end.
now,
in
the
court
of
appeals
hearing
on
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
the
petitioner
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
i
think
that'd
be
wrong
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
i'd
be
glad
to.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
and
then
i
think
at
the
same
time
that
will
pick
up
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
well,
the
labor
union
involved
in
this
dispute
reach
an
impasse
in
the
negotiations
for
renewal
of
a
contract
on
may
15,
1960.
the
picket
line
was
set
up.
there
were
negotiations
during
the
picketing.
on
the
24th
of
may,
there
was
a
verbal
agreement
as
everybody
thought
there
was
an
agreement
to
stop
the
strike.
the
men
went
back
to
work
on
the
24th
and
25th.on
the
26th,
the
evening
of
the
26th,
they've
got
together
to
sign
the
contract
as
the
petition
shows.
apparently,
upon
reaching,
and
i
think
this
is
a
fair
assumption
from
the
record,
when
it
was
done
on
writing,
that
wasn't
what
they
agreed
on,
at
least
the
man
had
signed,
this
is
in
the
evening
of
the
26th,
the
man
had
signed
it,
the
president
of
the
company
signed
it
but
the
international,
who
was
really
the
certified
bargaining
agent
here
refused
to
sign.
and
in
the
record
it
says,
“not
signed”
and
that's
the
printers
put
in
their
shoulder.
this
was
not
signed
by
the
international.
so
there
was
a
disagreement
that
night
and
the
next
morning,
the
picket
line
was
started
again.
that's
on
the
27th.
that
morning,
the
morning
of
the
27th,
the
petitioner
was
--
had
a
phone
call
and
was
retained
to
represent
the
union
if
necessary.
these
four
people
who
were
the
respondents
in
the
original
contempt
action
were
in
chicago.
this
was
in
1960,
although
the
courts
were
down,
they
were
negotiating
for
all
the
late
part
but
they
were
in
chicago.
so
the
petitioner
called
the
people
in
chicago
and
talk
to
them
about
it.
he
also
called
the
lawyer
for
the
company.
he
called
all
the
clerks
office
to
alert
them
that
if
the
petition
was
filed,
he
like
to
be
notified
it.
he
informed
the
lawyer
for
the
company
that
he
was
the
lawyer
for
the
--
for
the
union.
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
had
been
filed
that
morning.
it
was
filed
that
morning
charging
the
employer
with
refusal
to
bargain.
about
1
o'clock
that
afternoon,
1:15
or
something,
he
got
--
the
petitioner
got
a
call
from
the
clerk's
office
saying
that
the
petition
--
petitioner
had
been
filed
for
injunction
and
had
been
assigned
to
a
particular
judge
in
our
county,
when
the
case
is
assigned
to
a
judge
it
stays
with
him
throughout
the
whole
case.
he
called,
immediately,
called
judge
mckay
and
said
he
understood
that
mr.
regan,
the
lawyer
for
the
company
was
on
his
way
down
to
his
office
with
the
petitioner.
and
if
there
was
a
request
for
immediate
injunction,
would
--
he
would
be
in
his
office
and
would
he
please
to
call
him
and
he'd
like
to
be
heard
on
this
--
on
--
on
the
question
before
it
was
issued,
the
judge
says,
“fine,
you
stay
in
your
office
and
i'll
call
you.”
well,
the
next
thing
the
petitioner
heard,
not
from
the
lawyer
or
the
judge,
one
of
the
attachés
in
the
court
called
him
and
told
him
there'd
been
an
injunction
issued
against
these
people.
well,
the
petitioner
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
it
was
a
temporary
injunction
as
distinguished
from
a
restraining
order
pending
a
hearing
on
a
--
on
a
temporary
injunction.
in
ohio,
you
--
you
--
a
restraining
order
is
issued
under
the
statute
only
where
a
petition
for
temporary
injunction
is
set
for
a
hearing.
in
the
meantime,
the
statute
says,
“you
maybe
restrained”.
yes.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
no,
we
do
not.
well,
upon
the
hearing
of
this
issuance
of
this
ex
parte
injunction,
the
petitioner
and
his
associate,
who
happen
to
be
me,
went
over
to
see
the
judge
and
talked
him
about
this
thing
and
pointed
out
some
very
serious
problems
in
connection
with
interstate
commerce
and
a
labor
disputed
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
and
after
--
and
he
said
--
we
--
we
explained
it
to
him
and
he
said,
“well,
i
didn't
really
read
the
petition.
i
just
took
his
word
for
it.
i
understood
these
men
were
satisfied
with
the
contracts
and
some
hoodlums
down
in
detroit
and
--
and
made
him
go
back
to
work.”
well
as
i
say,
we
tried
to
explain
it
to
the
judge
and
said
we
--
suggested
that
he
didn't
have
any
jurisdiction.
he
said,
“well,
he
wouldn't
get
every
of
this
detroit
hoodlums.
this
is
in
the
record
from
this
town.
we'll
make
some
jurisdictions
or
have
any.”
and
for
--
finally,
after
his
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
it's
--
it's
also
in
the
record
--
it
would
be
under
the
june
7th
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
--
proceedings,
which
is
the
uncontradicted
testimony
of
the
petitioner
at
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
hearing
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
there's
no
dispute
but
there
was
at
the
--
at
the
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
there's
no
dispute.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
well,
after
some
conversations,
the
judge
finally
said
to
his
clerk,
“when
you
get
a
hold
of
mr.
regan,
you
tell
him
to
come
on
over
here
and
we'll
give
you
a
hearing,
we'll
have
a
hearing.”
well
what
about
4
o'clock
that
afternoon,
the
petitioner
then
called
--
called
back
to
the
court,
not
having
heard
anything
and
they
asked
about
it
and
--
this
is
friday
before
declaration
day.
by
the
way,
declaration
day
was
on
monday.
we
were
faced
a
long
weekend.
and
he
said,
“yes,
he
talked
to
mr.
regan
but
he
wasn't
going
to
hold
night
court,”
and
petitioner
said,
“well,
what
about
can
we
have
a
hearing
in
the
morning?”
explaining
that
--
for
the
situation.
he
said,
“no,
i'm
not
going
to
be
in
town
and
i
won't
be
here.
well,
how
about
some
other
judge?”
“well,
all
the
other
judges
are
busy.
there's
couple
a
way
of
fishing.”
“and,
well,
can
we
have
a
hearing
then
tuesday?”
“no,
i'm
going
to
busy
next
week.
you'll
just
have
to
wait
your
turn.”
well
that
means
six
or
seven
months
in
--
under
our
dock.
well
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
you
could
file
--
you
could
file
--
yes,
you
could
come
in
and
you
could
file
a
--
a
motion
to
dissolve
a
temporary
injunction
and
then
the
court
would
set
that
down
for
hearing.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
it
depends
on
just
the
court's
discretion.
i
know
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
that
have
preference.
it's
--
it's
a
matter
of
discretion
of
the
court.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
it
operated
until
the
end
of
the
strike,
mr.
justice
clark
until
or
the
following
week.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
sir.
now
that
what
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
sir.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right.
actually
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
under
the
part
of
the
petition
until
finally
termination
of
the
case,
i
mean
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
it
was
temporary
injunction,
yes,
sir.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
but
or
--
i
was
--
there
was
a
motion
filed
that
dissolved.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
that's
right
because
you
see
that
afternoon,
i
mean
after
this
4
o'clock
conversation,
the
petitioner
then
called
these
people
in
chicago
and
explained
the
whole
situation
to
him
and
said,
“now,
the
only
thing
i
would
know
that
a
few
people
want
to
continue
picketing,
then
if
they
--
if
you'll
file
--
if
the
employer
of
the
other
side
will
file
a
--
a
contempt
citation
then
we
could
probably
get
a
hearing
on
a
writ
if
they
find
few
people
in
--
in
contempt.
so
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
there
is
not.
it
cannot
--
on
ohio
--
temporary
orders
are
not
appeal.
it
was
just
final
orders.
well
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
if
he
had,
if
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
the
action.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
there's
no
--
there's
no
appeal
from
a
temporary
order
in
ohio.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
motion
to
dissolve
and
then
what
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right.
you're
still
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right.
now,
what
--
what
usually
happens?
i
wouldn't
say
usually,
but
what
can
happen.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
you
can
say
that
the
court
now
--
let's
--
after
you
--
you'd
bring
in
most
all
of
the
evidence
to
dissolve
the
temporary
and
then
you
ask
the
court
to
make
it
a
final
order.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
the
court
of
appeals
would
probably
take
four
months
now,
three
to
four
months.
so
this
--
this
is
a
friday
afternoon
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
i'm
sorry.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
--
that's
the
normal
--
i
think
every
--
i
think
i
can
say
this
is
without
fear
contradiction,
every
judge
in
our
court
of
common
pleas
except
this
one
judge
does
have
that
as
a
rule
that
they
--
in
a
labor
dispute
particularly,
they
will
not
--
unless
there
is
some
outstanding
violence
that
everybody
knows
about
or
something
like
this.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
oh,
yes.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
the
statute
in
ohio
says
that
at
the
beginning
of
a
case,
an
injunction
maybe
issued.
it
doesn't
say
which
--
if
the
court
can
issue
the
final
relief
grant
--
or
requested.
in
other
words
in
this
case
for
instance,
if
the
court
would
had
been
--
been
able
to
have
jurisdiction,
an
issue
to
relief,
the
final
relief
in
--
in
the
--
the
injunction,
this
type
of
a
case,
then
it
--
it
might
have
been
able
under
that
statute
to
issue
a
temporary
injunction
at
the
start
of
a
case.
in
other
words,
that
--
that's
an
issue
of
this
case.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
they
can
--
they
--
they
can
but
it
--
it'd
be
very,
very
unusual
as
it
was
in
this
situation
here.
in
other
words,
the
court
really
has
to
determine
its
jurisdiction
at
that
time
by
saying,
“well,
i
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
that
--
that
all
of
it
relief
requested
which
is
an
injunction.”
and
therefore
it
--
i
think
the
statute
says
where
it
appears
clear
that
the
court
has
the
right
you
see
which
of
course
was
not
--
we
don't
think
in
this
case.
well,
anyway
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no
--
none
whatsoever,
none
whatsoever.
that
was
agreed
all
the
way
through.
wasn't
--
there
wasn't
any
--
that
was
agreed
right
at
the
first
day
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
a
--
in
the
record
at
page
3,
i
think,
there's
a
description
of
the
picket
line,
there
were
some
pictures
of
the
picket
line
of
--
of
the
site.
and
they
were
--
they
are
not
in
the
record
but
there's
a
description
of
it
just
saying
that
there
was
a
picket
sign
against
the
building
and
the
men
were
apparently
sitting
in
an
automobile
some
place.
well,
anyway
at
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
sir?
mr.
merritt
w.
green
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
what
you
referred
to
is
at
the
very
conclusion
of
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph
in
the
petition,
there's
a
conclusion
of
the
plea.
they're
saying
that
this
picketing
was
illegal
by
reason
of
a
breach
of
a
contract,
really
the
contract
was
never
came
in
existence.
and
if
this
illegal
conduct
is
permitted
to
continue,
the
imminence
of
violence
there
--
there's
imminence
of
danger
to
life
living
property
to
the
employees.
and
it's
--
it's
a
typical
equity
pleading
of
the
--
at
the
conclusion.
but
in
the
body
of
a
petition
on
--
in
ohio,
you
have
to
plea
like
you
--
if
they
were
else
i
presume,
operative
facts.
there
is
a
one
fact
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
there
wasn't
one
fact.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right,
mr.
justice
brennan,
yes,
sir.
and
that's
clear
i
think
in
the
record.
well,
now
we're
back
to
this
4
o'clock
situation,
well,
now,
this
young
(inaudible)
find
the
situation,
he
calls
his
people
in
chicago
and
explains
to
them
but
--
what
they
can
do
and
what
they
can't
do
what
they're
up
against.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
friday
afternoon.
this
is
after
the
2nd
that
we
haven't
heard
from
the
court.
so
they
said,
“we'll
call
you
back.
all
the
people
are
here
in
chicago.”
and
that
and
that
night
at
8
o'clock,
they
called
back
and
said,
“we
have
decided
to
ask
the
men
to
go
ahead
and
picket
so
we
can
get
this
thing
before
the
court.
will
you
relay
that
message
to
the
headquarters?”
now
that
is
the
--
that's
the
entire
picture
of
the
petitioners
advised
to
his
client.
that's
it.
that's
the
whole
--
that's
--
that's
what
--
that's
what
the
petitioner
did.
after
being
confronted
with
these
situations,
seeing
it,
checking
the
law
in
ohio,
just
checking
the
--
the
garmon
case
and
very
other
cases,
called
his
people
and
told
them,
they
made
the
decision
at
8
o'clock
that
night
and
called
them
back
and
said,
“we
relayed
this
on”.
so
next
tuesday,
monday
being
a
holiday,
a
contempt
citation
was
filed
contempt
of
the
injunction.
they
met
in
the
chambers
of
the
judge
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
that's
right.
that's
right.
and
not
really
against
--
it
developed
not
against
the
pickets
but
the
lawyer
for
the
em
--
employer
said,
“well,
why
don't
you
bring
these
four
fellows
in
and
--
and
stipulate
and
then
we
can
get
this
right
on
the
road”
and
so
that's
what
they
decided
to
do.
so
the
next
morning,
that
was
the
first
to
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
that's
right,
sir.
the
next
morning
where
they
met
in
court
pursuant
to
that,
there's
a
--
the
employer's
attorney
made
a
statement.
the
petitioner
made
a
statement
to
bring
dollars,
stipulating
of
this
thing.
and
then
their
judge
says,
“now,
i
wonder
who
told
these
men.
they
went
into
a
lecture
on
the
signing
of
a
contract”
and
that
is
all
he
assumed
that
there
was
a
little
--
there
was
a
valid
contract
and
so
forth
and
so
forth.
he's
now
wondering
who
told
these
men.
well,
the
petitioner
was
caught
a
little
bit
by
surprise,
this
whole
situation
because
he
had
in
his
pocket
the
application
to
writs
for
the
men.
and
he
finally
said
to
him,
“well,
i
can
tell
you,
i
told
him.”
and
the
judge
said,
“have
you
told
him?”
he
said,
then
he
went
on
to
explain
with
some
interruptions
what
had
taken
place.
they
called
the
people
in
chicago
then
it
ends
up
by
the
petitioner
being
able
to
say
they
were
ordered
to
do
so,
maybe
that's
not
the
word
“order”
but
they
were
instructed
to
do
so
by
their
superiors
in
the
union.
well,
the
judge
might
have
said
then
you're
in
contempt
of
court
or
somebody
is
contempt
to
court
but
he
did
say
to
the
man
this,
“you
can
even
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
there's
something
in
the
record
that
saying
that
that's
contempt
of
court
and
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
referring
to
what
the
union
officers
told
the
man
to
do
or
what
the
petitioner
had
related
to
him
was
contempt
to
court.
that's
not
too
clear
except
from
happened
later
on.
there's
some
suspicion
that
he
might
have
been
talking
about
the
petitioner.
he
wasn't
contempt
to
court.
but
that
june
1st
hearing
ended
on
this
note.
but
the
judge
said
the
men,
“now,
you
can
either
go
back
to
work
or
you
can
come
in
friday
and
answer
--
and
show
cause
or
answer
to
contempt
to
court.”
and
he's
told
this
for
union
people.
well,
i
--
i
know
of
no
authority
in
law
that
--
that
you
can
do
something
like
that.
remember,
the
--
the
petition
in
this
case
was
not
for
specific
performance.
it
wasn't
for
really
for
the
violation
of
a
--
of
a
labor
contract
under
301.
it
wasn't
that
type
an
action.
it
was
just
plain
and
simple,
an
injunction
to
prohibit
peaceful
picketing.
so
the
next
friday,
people
come
back
--
the
man
came
back
in
court.
they
didn't
return
to
work
and
then
they
went
through
about
the
same
thing,
ending
up
the
--
after
the
evidence
was
in
so-called,
the
petitioner
said
to
the
court,
“well,
we
don't
care
to
proceed
any
further.”
that
is
the
--
no
testimony
in
behalf
of
the
union
officials
because
still
wanting
to
get
this
thing
on
its
way
upstairs.
there
was
some
intemperate
remarks
i
fear
from
the
court
and
--
and
which
he
said,
“and
you
also
told
these
men
to
disobey
the
court's
order.”
the
petitioner
said,
“i
did”
obviously
referring
to
the
context
of
this
whole
situation.
and
thereupon,
the
court
said,
“that's
contempt
to
court.”
mr.
merritt
w.
green
the
court?
mr.
merritt
w.
green
and
in
effect
saying
--
and
then
said
--
went
on
to
say
after
some
more
works,
the
petitioner,
“you
come
back
in
here
next
monday
with
a
lawyer”
and
so
forth
and
so
forth.
well,
on
monday,
for
the
first
time,
the
following
monday,
the
court
did
file
a
written
charge
under
the
sections
of
the
statute,
name
the
sections
which
were
indirect
contempt
charging
the
petitioner
with
contempt
to
court.
this
hearing
was
held
on
tuesday
in
the
--
just
was
just
this,
after
a
lot
of
difficulty,
the
court
finally
said,
“you're
not
here
for
any
hearing,
you're
not
here
for
any
trial.
you're
just
here
to
be
sentenced.”
we
asked
them
to
put
petitioner
on
said,
“no,
that
--
that's
--
you're
too
late
for
that.
i
would
let
what
petitio
--
petitioner
testify.”
we
then
read
into
the
record
what
the
petitioner
would
have
testified
to
have
been
permitted
to
testify.
well
obviously,
there
wasn't
any
use
under
those
circumstances
to
call
other
witnesses
who
were
in
the
courtroom
because
courts
there
had
been
no
trial
nor
hearing.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that
it's
--
that
the
record
is
--
has
devoid
of
any
pinpointing
of
--
of
that
except
that
it
--
i
would
say
under
the
court's
situation
of
this
--
of
when
the
petitioner
was
in
for
--
for
the
so-called
“trial”.
he
said
that
he's
only
here
for
sentencing
of
the
contempt
already
found
then
which
would
have
to
be
the
--
which
would
have
to
be
his
statement
when
he
related
truthfully
to
the
court
what
he
had
told
the
union
officials.
it
had
to
be
before
that
time.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
either
wednesday
or
friday,
the
first
or
the
third.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
that's
right.
well,
as
i
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
we
don't
know.
no,
this
was
--
as
i
say,
the
--
when
--
when
the
judge
said,
“$500
in
10
days,
take
him
away”.
there
was
a
couple
of
deputies
right
at
the
back
of
the
courtroom
already
waiting
for
it
and
we
asked
for
bond,
no
bond
and
then
we
immediately
filed
an
application
for
a
writ
which
we
had
prepared.
then
that
was
heard
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
sir?
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
that's
right.
he
was
taken
over
to
jail.
he
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
let
him
do
that,
wait
there.
and
then
he
was
released.
the
court
released
him
until
a
--
another
court
of
appeals
came
in.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
released
him
because
our
--
the
court
before
whom
the
--
to
which
the
writ
--
application
of
writ
had
been
made.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
they
gave
the
bond
because
they
didn't
hear
it
immediately,
heard
it
the
next
day.
they
--
they
asked
the
--
another
court
to
come
in
from
out
of
town
to
hear
it.
well,
at
that
--
at
that
session
before
the
court,
court
of
appeals
while
all
we
did
was
put
the
petitioner
on
the
stand,
swore
him
and
then
we
stipulated
that
if
he
were
to
testify,
the
testimony,
it
was
read
into
the
record
would
be
the
testimony
in
support
of
his
application
and
mitigation
and
so
forth
as
statute
provided.
well
now,
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
release
the
petitioner
saying,
one,
that
the
trial
court
had
a
right
to
issue
the
temporary
injunction
in
order
to
preserve
existing
conditions
until
such
time
as
it
could
determine
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
oh,
no,
i
meant
the
--
i
meant
the
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
mean
they
refused
to
release
him
on
the
writ
--
on
application
of
writ.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
sir.
they
also
said
that
they
couldn't
find
anything
in
the
record
where
the
plaintiff
or
whether
the
petitioner
was
denied
a
trial
or
a
hearing
on
june
7th.
and
they
also
said
that
being
a
lawyer
in
effect,
getting
the
right
to
advise
the
clients
as
he
did.
these
holdings
or
findings
were
in
--
were
upheld
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
treated
the
--
the
due
process
issue
just
in
one
sentence
saying
that
after
all,
the
one
little
paragraph
maybe
a
sense
in
his
petition.
the
--
the
court
that
sentenced
them
also
was
the
court
that
tried
the
--
was
trying
the
petitioner
or
the
pickets
and
therefore,
that
court
heard
him
say
that
this
and
so
therefore,
a
trial
or
hearing
wasn't
necessary.
the
court
also
made
a
pronouncement
--
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
i'm
talking
about
now.
i'm
not
leaving
my
time
on
the
due
process
thing,
the
denial
of
a
trial
and
so
forth
because
that's
terribly
important
but
i
think
it's
terribly
clear.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
sir?
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
but
--
there
are
other
issues
in
the
case,
i
think,
that
would
--
that
would
complete
the
case
in
--
in
its
entirety
although
if
you
agreed
on
that
one
point,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
made
me
and
then
we
would
have
to
go
back
for
--
before
that
trial.
now,
the
supreme
court
also
said
that
an
individual
against
whom
an
order
was
issued
could
violate
the
order
and
if
the
order
was
void,
they
could
set
that
up
in
defense
of
a
--
of
a
contempt
action.
but
the
supreme
court
said,
“a
lawyer
is
different.
if
a
lawyer
advises
his
client
that
that
order
is
void
then
he
is,
right
then
and
there,
guilty
of
contempt
to
court.”
mr.
merritt
w.
green
whether
it's
void
or
not.
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
in
those
circumstances,
the
--
the
order
is
not
subject
to
the
same
vulnerability.
that
would
be
for
the
individual.
well,
now
if
the
court
in
this
type
of
a
case
in
a
--
in
an
interstate
labor
case
can
deprive
union
officials
and
pickets
of
counsel
by
silencing
him
which
he
was
tried
to
jail
if
he
tells
him
what
is
accurate
legal
advice,
it's
--
though
i
--
i
don't
think
i
have
to
pursue
any
further
but
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right,
just
a
merit
of
advisory.
now,
let
me
--
i
--
i've
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right.
i
must
apologize
to
the
court
for
not
pursuing
this
phase.
i'm
going
to
talk
about
now
in
--
in
the
brief.
but
i
think
it
maybe
the
--
maybe
the
one
most
important
parts
in
this
whole
case.
in
ohio,
there's
a
--
there's
a
case,
albert
versus
juengling
and
sons,
115
ohio
state
64
which
is
almost
identical
to
this
case
except,
instead
of
being
a
lawyer
who
gave
the
advice,
it
was
the
president
of
the
union.
the
pickets
were
in
--
being
tried
for
contempt
of
--
of
an
injunction.
the
court
learned
that
the
union
president
was
sitting
back
in
the
audience.
and
they
said,
“come
here.
are
you
the
president?”
“yes.”
“do
you
know
about
this
injunction?”
“did
you
advise
your
men
to
go
ahead
and
violate
this
order?”
“yes,
i
did.”
“that's
all
i
want
to
hear.
you're
in
contempt
to
court”,
our
supreme
court
said.
“you
can't
do
that.
you
got
to
give
me
a
hearing.
i
mean
the
statute
provides.”
the
--
the
court
said
that
that's
an
indirect
contempt.
the
statute
provides
he
--
he's
got
every
hearing.
he
has
to
have
notice.
he
has
to
have
a
hearing
and
which
time
he
can
come
in
with
everything
he
has
in
order
to
explain
his
--
his
situation
to
the
court.
now,
there's
one
other
case
after
that
that
goes
along
with
that
same
theory.
so
in
ohio,
we
have
this
situation
that
a
union
person
or
a
person
who's
not
a
lawyer
is
entitled
to
a
trial
in
situation
like
this
for
advice
given
to
--
of
sound
advice
to
violate
an
--
an
injunction
order
but
you
got
another
--
apparently,
a
lawyer
has
denied
that
same
protection
to
the
law.
the
lawyer
just
because
he's
a
lawyer,
he's
then
in
a
criminal
action
because
that's
what
it
has
to
be
is
denied
the
equal
protection
of
those
ohio
laws
and
just
because
he's
a
lawyer,
he's
--
by
giving
correct
advice,
that's
one
of
the
most
do,
he's
guilty
of
--
of
contempt.
well
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that's
--
they
did
not
say
anything
about.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
alluded
to
the
fact
that
this
might
have
been
a
direct
contempt
because
he
told
them,
told
them
the
truth,
told
the
court
what
he
had
done
and
that
might
be.
but
however,
the
court
said
in
as
much
as
the
trial
judge
filed
that
the
charges
which
are
indi
--
which
are
charges
under
our
statutes
for
indirect
attempt,
then
it
was
indirect
contempt
you
see.
now,
then
our
supreme
court
said,
number
one,
that
this
was
a
status
quo
order.
this
was
the
effect
of
it.
they
followed
the
court
of
appeals
saying
that
a
--
a
court
could
issue
a
temporary
order
and
without
any
consideration
to
where
they
had
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
it
had
to
be
a
bidden
until
the
court
got
around
to
deciding
it.
they
alluded
--
they
acquainted
it
to
the
true
status
quo
cases
like
the
mine
workers
case
back
during
the
war
when
john
l.
lewis
got
in
trouble
with
--
with
the
government
when
they
--
when
the
government
is
running
the
mines.
and
in
that
case,
the
--
the
court
will
remember,
the
--
the
government
filed
a
declaratory
judgment
action
on
the
district
court.
and
prior
to
the
--
to
the
contract
expiring
because
there'd
been
some
threat
that
no
contract,
no
work.
there
was
declaratory
judgment
action
and
then
the
case
was
set
for
hearing
on
a
temporary
injunction.
and
in
the
meantime,
lewis'
miners
were
restrained
but
when
they
went
ahead
and
--
and
struck
anyway,
and
the
court
brought
contempt
action
against
them.
now,
that
is
a
true,
as
i
see
it,
a
true
status
quo
question
where
you
are
really
preserving
something.
it's
not
the
main
relief
sought
like
it
was
in
this
case,
the
injunction,
but
it's
ancillary
to
the
main
relief
sought
until
we
can
determine
this
then
we
--
you
hold
everything
here.
they
also
acquainted
this
with
the
ship
case.
that
was
one
of
the
landmark
cases
of
this
court
where
the
tennessee
court
had
sentenced
the
man
to
death.
the
court
of
--
the
district
--
the
circuit
court
affirmed
that
decision
and
a
petition
was
filed
in
this
court,
an
application
to
appeal.
and
one
of
the
justices
on
friday
granted
the
proper
jurisdiction
and
noted
i
guess,
then
monday,
the
court
did
take
it
on
appeal
then
issued
an
order
that
--
to
the
tennessee
people
not
to
do
anything
in
the
meantime.
while
the
sheriff
and
some
people
that
night
hung
this
man
and
they
--
this
court
said
well
let
--
when
we
issued
a
--
and
we're
the
only
ones
that
could
determine
our
own
jurisdiction,
and
when
we
issue
--
that
was
--
to
preserve
the
status
quo,
well
that's
what
it
was
for.
well
now,
i
can't
--
i
don't
believe
there's
any
resemblance
between
the
two
cases.
this
is
not
a
true
statu
--
status
quo
order
because
first
place,
the
judge
didn't
mean
it
to
be
a
status
quo
order
and
there's
nothing
to
preserve.
this
prohibited
the
picketing.
had
there
been
a
temporary
injunction
set
for
hearing
and
a
restraining
order
issue,
then
we
might
get
close
to
a
status
quo
order.
well,
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
did
not
even
allude
--
the
court
of
appeals
never
even
alluded
to
the
federal
preemption
doctrine
as
to
where
the
--
that
--
that
part
where
the
jurisdiction
has
been
withdrawn
where
it's
arguably
or
potentially
a
matter
of
--
in
section
7
or
8
of
labor
management
relations
act
you
see.
they
never
even
mentioned
that.
the
supreme
court
just
alluded
to
it
in
--
in
passing
almost
looking
over
it
shoulder
and
saying,
“well,
anyway,
we
have
--
you
have
a
right
even
though
there's
no
violence
and
--
and
no
semblance
of
violence”,
we
have
a
right
because
of
the
petition
says
there
was
imminence
of
violence
so
therefore,
an
injunction
could
be
issued.
well
now,
i
don't
think
it
takes
much
for
me
to
point
out
what
that
does
to
labor-management
relations.
if
a
court
can
issue
without
any
consideration
and
when
it's
almost
--
it's
evident
on
the
phase
of
the
petition
that
this
is
interstate
labor
matter.
when
a
court
can
issue
an
ex
parte
injunction
and
then
refuse
to
give
anybody
a
hearing,
well,
you
just
takeaway
from
workers
their
right
to
--
that's
guaranteed
to
him
under
section
7.
you
just
--
you
just
paralyze
the
--
this
phase
of
--
i
think
i
actually
if
these
were
to
be
the
law
that
continued
in
ohio,
this
sort
of
performance
that
the
preemption
doctrine
has
no
longer
in
existence
in
ohio
because
all
you
have
to
do
is
plead
and
then
by
conclusions
saying
that
if
you
don't
do
something,
something's
might
be
able
to
happen
in
the
future.
this
is
going
to
be
harmful
to
the
property
of
these
people
without
any
basis
for
it.
now,
the
petitioner,
i
mean
the
respondent
here
meets
this
question
of
the
lack
of
due
process
or
denial
of
due
process
in
the
trial
by
saying
well
that
was
cured
because
the
petitioner
read
into
the
record
he's
offered
a
proof.
well,
i
--
i
hardly
think
that
that
meets
the
standards
of
due
process
that
has
been
established
by
this
court
where
they
even
go
as
far
within
the
one
michigan
case
where
the
one-man
grand
jury
who
cited
--
who
issued
the
citation,
the
court
said
that
the
due
process
and
not
only
includes
notice
on
the
right
to
counsel
or
right
to
a
hearing
but
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
judge
who
hasn't
already
found
the
person
guilty.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
that
was
just
a
--
just
a
proper
and
that
was
with
some
great
difficulty
that
we
--
the
court
even
let
us
put
that
in
before
he
said
he
didn't
want
the
record
all
put
it
up
with
that
sort
of
stuff
and
--
but
anyway,
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
mr.
justice
black,
the
supreme
court
never
mentioned
--
you
mean
supreme
court
of
ohio?
mr.
merritt
w.
green
never
mentioned
any
--
oliver
case,
the
murchison
case
or
none
of
those
cases.
they
never
--
the
only
thing
they
said
about
the
lack
of
a
trial
was
after
all
the
judge
who
sentenced
them
was
also
the
judge
who
heard
the
testimony
against
the
pickets
and
therefore,
it
wasn't
necessary
for
them
to
have
another
hearing.
that's
i
think
on
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
it
was
a
five
to
two.
judge
bell
wrote
the
dis
--
the
dissenting
opinion
joined
in
by
taft.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
do
you
mean
the
supreme
court?
mr.
merritt
w.
green
just
the
fact
that
he
was
a
lawyer,
and
the
lawyer
had
--
and
they
said
that
the
lawyer
was
held
to
a
higher
duty
than
the
layman
in
effect
saying,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
layman
if
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
none.
just
that
he
was
a
lawyer
and
he
--
and
he
should
obey
--
he
should
obey
or
see
that
his
clients
obey
the
order
so
as
long
as
they
remain
in
existence.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
the
effect
of
it.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
way
the
--
the
way
the
court
said
it
that
he
bra
--
brazenly,
not
ordered,
but
i
think
maybe
direct
to
their
--
or
advised
his
clients
to
violate
the
order.
now,
actually
as
i've
explained
it,
the
only
thing
he
did
was
to
call
his
people
in
chicago
and
said,
“now,
here's
a
situation,
an
ex
parte
order
has
been
issued.
we've
talked
to
the
judge
and
again
and
again
and
--
and
he's
not
going
to
give
us
a
hearing.
you're
not
going
to
get
one
next
week
and
so
forth.
now,
the
only
way
i
know
you're
going
to
get
a
hearing
is
that
you
want
your
men
to
go
ahead
and
violate
the
order.
and
then
if
there's
application
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
he
said,
“i
can
tell
the
court
now
that
they
were
advised
by
me”.
and
then
he
went
on
to
explain
just
what
i've
told
you
here.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right.
and
that
the
final
instructions
have
come
from
his
superiors
and
from
the
superiors
of
the
union
to
the
men.
and
then
on
the
3rd,
it
was
just
that
one
two
words,
when
the
judge
apparently
was
a
little
put
out
because
the
--
the
pickets
were
not
brought
forth
on
the
stand
because
actually,
they
were
still
just
want
to
get
a
--
get
a
conviction
on
that
so
they
could
go
upstairs.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
apparently.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right.
our
supreme
court
only
used
that
one
--
i
think
the
one
sentence
on
--
it's
on
page
69
of
the
record.
and
here
--
here
is
all,
there's
a
paragraph,
read
the
whole
paragraph
to
it.
as
to
the
hearing
had
on
such
charge
on
june
7th,
1960
was
not
conducted
with
the
decorum
and
restrain
that
should
have
been
but
to
say
that
it
was
such
a
(inaudible)
deny
the
appellant
due
process
of
laws
are
hardly
justified.
the
contempt
had
already
occurred
as
disclosed
in
a
hearing
on
june
1st
and
june
3rd
and
the
judge
presiding
over
that
hearing
was
the
same
judge
who
issued
a
restraining
order
and
who
conducted
the
proceedings
on
june
7th.
now,
of
course,
the
petitioner
was
not
--
before
the
court
on
the
1st
and
3rd
except
in
a
representative
capacity
representing
the
--
as
a
lawyer,
representing
the
people,
he
was
not
there
pursuant
to
notice
or
he
didn't
even
know
that
he's
the
most
priced
person
in
the
courtroom
that
he
was
--
the
judge
says
your
in
contempt
of
court.
but
that's
all
it
said
about
the
denial
of
a
trial,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
they
were
the
ones
that
were
brought
in
for
contempt
on
the
1st
and
3rd
but
they
never
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
there
was
never
an
order
of
--
of
contempt
for
which
we
get
appealed.
see,
on
--
on
friday,
the
judge
says,
“well,
you've
taken
the
onus
on
yourself,
you
stand
in
their
shoes,
you're
guilty
of
contempt,
come
back
here”.
and
he
dismissed
the
other
people
by
just
saying,
“well,
don't
be
too
afraid.
i
know
what
i'm
going
to
do
with
you
fellows.
and
after
this,
whenever
you
get
an
order,
no
matter
whether
that's
right
or
wrong,
obey
the
order
of
the
court,
just
like
in
the
army
and
--”
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no.
i
think
--
he
may
have
said
that
they
were
--
they
were
guilty
but
he
never
filed
it
up
with
an
order
and
then
--
you
see
the
day
we're
in
the
court
of
appeals,
arguing
on
the
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
--
it
was
announced
there
to
the
court
that
the
--
that
the
injunction
action
was
dismissed
that
morning.
strike
was
over.
that
over
you
see.
they
had
entered
into
a
--
to
a
--
to
a
new
one
different
agreement.
i
mean,
that
--
they
finally
concluded
their
agreement,
let
me
put
that
way.
and
at
that
time
of
course,
it
was
evident
to
--
to
that
court
and
the
supreme
court
but
not
only
was
there
nlrb
proceedings
against
the
--
pending
against
the
employer
but
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that
was
dismissed
as
part
of
the
strike
settlement,
and
--
and
that
was
also
agreed
that
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
violence
and
then
violence
never
came
in
to
the
play.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that
was
agreed
in
the
judges
chambers
that
that
was
--
that
was
a
--
the
procedure
was
agreed
by
them
that
--
to
do
--
to
follow
the
next
day
and
on
that
effect
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
sir
--
oh,
yes,
oh,
yes.
that's
in
the
record
and
the
recitation
of
what
the
--
what
the
petitioner
would
have
testified
to.
now,
that
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
both
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
supreme
court.
both
speak
of
that
thing
that
after
all,
he
has
announced
the
(inaudible)
part
of
a
lawyer
within
the
framework
of
the
law
to
--
to
still
continue
to
see
justice
for
his
clients
when
he
keep
bumps
up
against
the
stone
wall.
there's
no
--
there's
nothing
in
this
record
despite
what
the
respondent
would
like
to
have
you
believe
in
his
brief.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
justify
that
anything
that
the
petitioner
did,
the
only
thing
he
did
was
this
--
this
4
o'clock
call
to
--
to
people
in
chicago.
and
they
made
the
decision
that
this
was
a
matter
of
defiance
that
this
was
done
in
the
spirit
of
defiance
of
--
of
a
court
or
this
was
just
a
--
an
honest
and
maybe
dangerous,
it
appears
to
be
up
to
this
point,
effort
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
to
--
and
the
pursue
to
justice
for
his
people.
that's
about
what
i'm
talking
to.
i
think
i
will
reserve
what
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
unless
the
court
has
some
other
question.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
mr.
justice
black
or
mr.
justice
clark
and
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
some
question
about
the
form
in
which
the
order
was.
i
have
here
a
copy
of
the
original
petition
and
here's
the
way
it's
done
in
ohio
at
the
conclusion
of
the
petition
judge
stamp
was
there
and
all
that
says
is
that
temporary
restraining
order
allowed
as
prayed
for
may
27,
1960
at
1:40
p.m.
that's
the
only
order
that
was
issued
and
that's
the
way
it's
done
and
that's
the
way
it
was
done
in
this
case
and
no
separate
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
fine.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
oh,
yes
your
honor.
there's
been
some
issue
made
of
the
absence
of
a
motion
to
dissolve
or
its
consequences.
i'll
just
remind
the
court
that
it
was
at
4
o'clock
on
the
afternoon
--
friday
afternoon
prior
to
declaration
day
that
the
lawyer
conferred
by
telephone
or
reported
by
telephone
to
his
clients
in
chicago
the
status
of
the
situation.
that
was
after
the
court
--
lower
court
had
twice
failed
to
carry
out
its
assurances
to
the
petitioner
about
the
petition
and
so
forth
and
it
was
until
the
next
tuesday
in
the
court's
chambers
that
the
petitioner
had
an
opportunity
to
present
a
motion
to
dissolve
the
temporary
injunction.
now,
it
is
true
under
the
ohio
law
that
when
a
motion
for
a
temporary
--
a
motion
is
made
to
dissolve
a
temporary
injunction
that
has
to
be
with
notice
to
--
to
counsel
on
the
other
side.
so
if
you
file
a
motion,
the
first
thing
you
do
is
to
go
in
to
court
and
say,
"i
want
to
file
a
motion
but
i
have
to
put
on
my
notice,"
the
time
that
it's
set
for
hearing
because
you'd
have
to
give
the
counsel
to
the
other
side
notice
when
he
should
appear
for
hearing
in
the
motion
to
dissolve
a
temporary
injunction.
but
the
motion
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right.
actually,
it's
the
convenience
mostly
of
the
court
calendar
in
addition
to
accommodating
the
lawyers
if
the
court's
calendar
permits
it.
but
you
see,
because
there
wasn't
any
contact
between
the
court
at
4
o'clock
on
friday
afternoon
until
tuesday
afternoon,
monday
being
a
holiday
at
which
time
he
presented
to
the
court
or
said
to
the
court,
and
remember
this
is
the
unrefuted
and
uncontradicted
testimony
under
oath
of
the
petitioner.
i
just
want
to
read
one
paragraph
of
the
record
that's
--
that
preceded
the
part
that
you
read
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
reagan
opened
the
discussion
and
he
and
the
judge
talked
for
some
time
during
that
con
--
which
conversation
the
court
concluded
that
it
did
not
intend
to
reform
the
contract,
feeling
it
necessary
to
advise
the
court
of
my
position
on
the
jurisdictional
matter
involved,
i
interrupt
the
conversation
and
i
ask
if
i
could
say
a
few
words,
a
request
judge
mckay
graciously
granted.
i
attempted
to
explain
that
the
matter
to
him
pointing
out
that
i
was
there
only
to
object
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
that
my
prime
interest
was
to
have
the
matter
heard
so
that
we
could
either
appeal
it
or
get
it
before
the
nlrb
or
get
it
where
it
belong.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
this
is
the
statement
of
--
of
the
petitioner
under
oath.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
as
to
what
took
place
in
the
court's
chambers
when
they
set
up
this
procedure
of
stipulations
so
forth.
judge
mckay
had
suggested
that
i
was
obsessed
with
his
point
that
mr.
--
and
mr.
reagan
suggested
that
i
will
file
a
motion
to
vacate
the
restraining
order.
and
then
to
follow
it
immediately
in
the
record
what
you
read
where
the
petitioner
said
“i
have
the
restraining
order
and
i'll
be
glad
to
set
up
--
we're
going
to
have
the
file
if
the
court
will
give
us
a
hearing”
and
so
forth,
and
because,
that's
the
first
time
that
he
was
before
the
court
and
could
present
one
so
that
they
can
put
the
time
in
there,
you
see.
so
actually,
the
respondent
for
some
reason
tries
to
read
into
this
thing,
an
attitude
on
the
--
of
--
of
defiance
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner.
this
is
the
first
time
actually
that
there's
ever
been
any
claim
made
in
this
court,
it's
not
in
the
brief,
i
don't
believe
that
--
that
the
attitude
of
the
petitioner
is
one
of
defiance
to
constitute
authority,
there's
not
one
thing
in
the
record
i
--
i
suggest
that
--
that
indicates
that
the
petitioner
was
trying
to
do
anything
other
than
to
--
to
get
justice
for
his
clients
to
find
some
means
to
do
it.
now,
here's
all
the
petitioner
did
and
it's
on
page
41.
he
says
--
and
this
is
just
one
paragraph
and
there
are
two
paragraphs
that
i'm
reading
but
i
think
it
elucidates
what
we're
interested
in
here.
operating
on
the
--
on
this
conviction,
meaning
that
he
wasn't
going
to
get
a
hearing.
this
is
the
--
the
petitioner's
testimony
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
his
application
for
a
writ.
we
consult
to
the
higher
authorities
to
affirm
the
position
that
an
order
made
by
a
court
in
a
matter
of
which
it
had
no
jurisdiction
is
absolutely
void.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes
that's
right.
the
grimes
and
harlan
(ph)
and
two
or
three
other
ohio
cases
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no
--
no
--
no
--
yes.
that
--
in
which
it
has
no
jurisdiction
is
absolutely
void
and
therefore
contempt
proceedings
could
not
issue
thereupon
--
thereon.
i
thereupon
called
mr.
friedman
in
chicago
and
advised
him
as
to
the
status
of
the
matter.
mr.
friedman
was
the
regional
counsel
for
the
union
who
was
really
the
man
who
retained
petitioner.
i
explained
to
him
that
though
it
was
possible
to
file
a
motion
to
vacate
or
to
demur
the
petition
that
it
was
apparent
from
the
action
of
the
court
that
such
a
motion
would
not
be
set
down
for
a
hearing
in
the
near
future
and
that
even
if
it
were,
an
adverse
ruling
would
seem
most
likely
in
view
of
the
court's
attitude
would
not
be
a
final
order
and
could
not
be
appealed.
i
then
told
them
if
i
were
correct
under
the
law
that
the
order
of
the
court
was
wholly
invalid
that
the
only
alternative
would
be
to
find
the
order
of
the
court
on
the
hopes
that
mr.
reagan
would
file
contempt
proceedings
which
would
undoubtedly
be
heard
immediately
and
from
which
we
could
instantly
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
well
that's
the
whole
--
that's
the
--
that's
what
the
--
that's
the
advice
that
he
gave
after
which
yourself
will
be
in
contempt.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
he
had
one
right
in
his
pocket
as
a
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
--
matter
of
fact.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes,
that's
right.
now
there's
one
other
thing
i'd
like
to
bring
our
the
court's
attention
on
this
question
of
attitude
of
what
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
yes.
i'll
--
i'm
just
going
to
bring
to
that
right
now.
on
june
1st,
this
is
what
mr.
neidlinger
left
out,
this
part
of
it.
one
from
the
--
when
he
said,
"i
can
tell
you
how
it
happened
or
i
can
tell
you
i
--"
then
he
went
to
explain
but
here
is
what
he
wind
up
and
said,
"i
have
said
i've
already
said
to
the
court
that
they
obviously
didn't
act
--
did
not
act
on
their
own
initiative."
the
court,
"who
did?"
mr.
green,
"well,
they
were
interruptions."
go
back
to
pick
it
up.
well,
they
were
instructed
to
do
so
by
their
superiors
in
the
union
in
this
case.
you
see,
that's
where
he
finished
off
and
said
that
--
explaining
and
said,
"well,
i
can
tell
him
that
i
did."
but
then
he
goes
on
to
explain
that
really
the
orders
came
from
the
superiors.
now,
the
next
--
it's
the
second
day
on
the
third
where
--
where
it
says,
"i
did."
well,
i
submit,
when
you're
in
one
of
these
fast
exchanges
with
the
court
and
the
court
is
a
little
irked,
the
insults
that
the
petitioner
right
before
that
and
saying,
"are
these
people
represented?"
the
petitioner
says,
"yes,
i'm
still
representing
--
oh
i
met
my
lawyer
or
something
like
that."
and
then
he
said,
"you
also
advised
them
to
violate
the
order
of
the
court
or
however
he
can
said
it,"
he
said,
"i
did."
well,
he
mean
--
sure
i
advised
them
that
if
they
want
to
get
a
hearing,
you
have
--
you
take
it
in
its
full
context,
you
just
can't
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
i
don't
think
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
well,
i
don't
think
it's
the
question
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
he
set
it
up
in
front
of
him.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
i
guess
the
petitioner
--
that
wasn't
filed
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
that's
been
filed
at
that
very
day,
just
a
few
minutes
before
they're
in
the
judge's
chamber
that
was
--
that's
right.
it
all
took
place
on
tuesday
at
the
same
time.
see,
the
real
issues
in
this
--
i
mean
the
very
vital
things.
this
--
this
case
strikes
at
the
very
heart
of
--
and
this
can
be
distractive
of
the
labor
management
situation
and
that
strikes
there
at
the
very
heart
of
the
administration
of
justice,
if
you're
going
to
say
that
a
lawyer
is
going
to
go
to
jail
for
honestly
advising
his
clients.
i
mean,
this
raises
it
way
above
the
question
of
just
denial
of
trial
and
i
think
that
is
really
a
very
potent
issue
in
this
case.
of
course,
i
think
the
question
of,
would
--
there
was
a
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place
because
certainly,
if
this
device
can
be
used
in
--
in
--
to
stop
peaceful
picketing
in
labor
cases
or
in
interstate
commerce,
well
then,
you
have
no
more
preemption
doctrine.
you
just
take
away
from
the
nlrb
at
the
jurisdiction
giving
it
to
him
--
given
to
him
by
labor
management
relations
act.
thank
you.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
sure.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
well,
you
can
have
this.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
and
i
will
give
it
to
the
court
clerk
mr.
merritt
w.
green
thank
you
so
much.
