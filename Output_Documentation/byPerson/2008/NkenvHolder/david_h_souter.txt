justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
it's
a
fluke,
too,
but
you
gave
--
in
my
recollection
--
i
forget
where
it
was
--
i
think
you
gave
citations
to
three
or
four
cases
in
which
that
actually
happened,
didn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
were
the
examples
that
she
gives,
the
two
or
three
cases,
properly
examples
under
this
section,
in
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
--
may
i
interrupt
you
just
a
second?
when
i
meant
examples,
i
meant
the
cited
cases.
there
were
two
or
three
cited
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
difference
would
it
make?
i
mean,
if
he
--
if
he
can
satisfy
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
which
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
on
final
judgment
i
win,
hands
down,
what
--
what
need
is
there
to
--
to
go
into
irreparable
harm?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
--
but
--
but
that's
--
no,
well,
in
any
case,
if
he's
got
to
show
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
he's
going
to
have
success
on
the
merits,
i
don't
see
any
point
in
any
case
to
going
into
irreparable
harm.
if
he
goes
into
irreparable
harm
without
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
he
loses.
if
he
satisfies
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
there's
nothing
for
irreparable
harm
considerations
to
add
to
--
to
the
--
to
the
mix
of
factors.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
more
than
a
--
it's
certainly
more
than
a
preponderance?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
ultimate
--
the
ultimate
standard
to
which
they
look
is
a
preponderance
standard.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
substantial
evidence
standard
is
keyed
to
what
a
reasonable
fact-finder
could
find
reasonably,
based
upon
substantial
evidence.
is
the
substantial
evidence
sufficient
for
such
a
fact-finder
to
find
by
a
preponderance
that
this
person
has
failed
to
meet
or,
put
it
the
other
way
around,
that
the
fact-finder
has
unreasonably
failed
to
find
that
the
petitioner
has
met
the
standard?
so
ultimately
you're
talking
about
a
preponderance
standard,
which
is
--
which
is
the
key.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
--
and
i
applaud
the
fact
that
you
don't,
but
i
don't
know
how
you
can
do
it
consistently
with
your
view
that
(b)(3)(b)
means
the
same
thing
as
(f)
when
(f)
is
restricted
as
much
as
it
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
god
--
god
bless
you,
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
how
under
the
statute,
on
your
reading
of
the
statute,
you
--
you
can
do
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then
why
doesn't
that
provide
the
broader
authority
under
(b)(3)(b)
stay
provision
that
--
that
your
friends
on
the
other
side
are
arguing
for?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
this
is
a
longer
temporary
stay
than
you
conceded
a
few
moments
ago.
i
mean,
you
were
talking
about
friday
night
to
--
to
monday
morning,
when
--
when
you
were
--
when
you
were
conceding
the
stay
on
the
hobbs
analogy.
i
don't
know
how
many
months
it's
been,
but
--
but
this
is
no
friday-night-to-monday-morning
stay.
