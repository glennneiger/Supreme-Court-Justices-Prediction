justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
that
particular
point,
just
specifically
--
this
is
awfully
complicated
and
you've
had
to
go
into
it
pretty
quickly,
and
so
have
i.
all
right.
so
it
seemed
to
me,
looking
at
these
three
sections,
as
soon
as
you
get
to
(a)(2),
it
says
certain
matters
are
not
subject
to
judicial
review,
and
it
includes
1225(b)(1),
which
i
take
it
is
the
case
where
somebody
comes
in,
knocks
at
our
door,
and
the
immigration
judge
says
goodbye,
and
he
says,
no,
no,
i'm
entitled
to
be
a
refugee
or
asylum.
okay.
now,
we
look
at
that.
it
says
in
there
it's
--
subsection
(e)
gives
you
judicial
review
of
that.
now
we
look
at
the
thing
you
cited
which
is
(5),
which
is
(a)(5),
and
you
read
it
completely
correctly,
but
you
left
out
these
words
"except
as
provided
in
subsection
(e).
"
so
now
we
go
to
subsection
(e).
and
lo
and
behold,
what
is
subsection
(e)
talking
about,
but
just
the
case
i
mentioned.
it
talks
about
--
it
talks
about
judicial
review
for
orders
under
1225(b)(1).
now,
those
are
the
people
who
knock
at
the
door
and
they
want
asylum.
and
there
are
some
procedures
for
them.
so,
now
we
look
at
(e)
to
see
what
are
the
procedures
for
them.
and
lo
and
behold,
right
there
in
(2),
is
--
it
says
you
can
have
a
habeas
corpus
procedure
as
to
certain
matters,
whether
he's
an
alien,
whether
he's
admitted,
admitted
as
a
refugee,
et
cetera.
so
it
says
there
are
some
you
can
have
habeas
corpus.
so
i
imagine
a
person
who
has
been
ordered
removed
under
(e).
now
it
says
you
can
have
a
habeas
corpus
and
now
the
judge
says
goodbye.
and
they
go
to
a
reviewing
court,
which
is
going
to
be
a
habeas
corpus
court,
and
that
court
decides,
the
alien
is
right.
i'm
going
to
issue
an
injunction.
now,
just
in
case
he's
thinking
that,
in
the
very
next
section
(f),
what
we
have
are
two
provisions,
(f)(1)
that
says
if
his
case
is
a
case
involving
mass
action
against
the
whole
thing,
you
can't
enter
an
injunction.
and
then
we
look
at
(2),
and
it
says
if
his
is
just
a
normal
case,
you
can't
enter
an
injunction
unless
it
meets
this
specific
standard.
so
i
looked
at
that.
i
admit
this
is
pretty
quick.
and
i
thought
it's
(e)
and
it's
(f),
and
(f)
is
dealing
with
(e),
(f)(2).
and
it
makes
perfect
sense.
they
don't
want
a
habeas
corpus
judge
telling
that
immigration
judge
what
to
do
with
the
guy
knocking
on
the
door
and
saying,
i
need
asylum,
unless
they
meet
clear
and
present
danger
--
clear
and
--
whatever
it
is.
clear
and
present,
yes.
now,
i
admit
i
read
that
quickly.
and
therefore,
i'm
probably
missing
something.
and
i
don't
expect
you
necessarily
to
be
an
expert,
but
can
you
do
your
best
to
tell
me
what
i'm
missing
or
if
you
think
i
might
be
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
it
says
here
specifically
is
it
says
habeas
proceedings.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
good.
let
me
add
one
other
thing,
because
all
i'm
trying
to
do
is
find
some
work
for
this
section
(f)(2)
to
do.
and
now
i
seem
to
have
found
some.
and
i
think
what
you
say
was,
wait
a
minute,
we
agree
it's
like
habeas.
but
and
i
think
it
would
be
like
an
exclusion
order
rather
than
a
removal
order.
and
i
did
notice
previously
when
it
talks
about
1225,
sometimes
it
uses
the
word
"exclusion"
and
sometimes
it
says
"removal".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
were
that
district
habeas
judge
and
you
get
a
thing
saying
removal,
you
don't
really
vacate
it.
i
think
what
you
do
is
order
an
injunction
against
its
enforcement.
here,
i
don't
know.
do
you
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
what
would
you
do?
suppose
you're
a
district
court
judge
and
at
2:00
in
the
afternoon
on
friday
a
petition
comes
in
and
it's
from
someone
who
says,
i'm
going
to
be
on
the
5
o'clock
airplane
to
hong
kong
and
i
have
a
real
case
here.
i
think
i'm
right.
and
he
has
eight
pages
attached,
and
you
read
through
that.
and
you
say,
he
has
a
point.
now,
how
good
this
point
is
i
don't
know.
so
i'd
like
to
put
this
--
i'd
like
to
have
everybody
in
here
on
monday,
and
then
i
could
figure
it
out.
now,
that
probably
happens.
now,
what's
worrying
me
about
your
position
on
this
--
which,
almost
--
i
think
every
circuit
is
against
you
on
this,
except
for
this
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
it
seems
to
me
it
would
make
it
impossible
for
the
district
judge
to
do,
because
the
district
judge
cannot
honestly
say
that
it's
clear
and
convincing
that
this
man
is
going
to
win.
all
he
knows
is
he
has
a
point,
he
would
like
to
hear
more
about
it,
and
he
doesn't
want
him
on
the
airplane
3
hours
from
now
from
hong
kong.
so
i
--
so
how
is
this
supposed
to
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
court
would
ever
do
anything
else?
i
mean,
why,
if
you
were
granting
a
stay,
would
you
not
want
to
do
that
so
you
can
fully
consider
the
issues?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
with
1225?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
sure?
because
----
[laughter]
--you
didn't
mention
it.
if
i
am
right,
why
didn't
you
mention
it?
