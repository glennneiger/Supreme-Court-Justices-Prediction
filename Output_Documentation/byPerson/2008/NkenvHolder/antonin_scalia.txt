they
wouldn't
be
deciding
it
the
same
way
twice.
initially,
they'd
just
have
to
decide
whether
--
whether
the
alien
has
shown
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
he
should
win,
and
if
they
decide,
no,
he
hasn't,
then
at
the
merits
stage,
they
have
to
decide
which
one
prevails
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
so
it's
really
a
--
a
different
call
the
second
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
claim
that
--
that
(f)(2)
covers,
if
it
doesn't
cover
these
stays?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
he
seek
to
enjoin
his
removal
when
he
--
he's
subject
to
a
much
lesser
standard
if
he
just
seeks
to
stay
the
removal?
i
mean,
he
has
a
bad
lawyer
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
he
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
is
the
next
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
fluke.
i
mean,
that
is
a
flukey
situation.
and
i
--
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
(f)(2)
was
meant
to
address
just
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
also
a
fluke.
we
--
we
don't
expect
the
--
the
executive
to
ignore
a
stay.
