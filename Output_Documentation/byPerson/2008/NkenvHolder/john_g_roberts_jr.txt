chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
nken
v.
filip.
ms.
harrison.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
this
matters
very
much,
but
do
you
know,
are
stays
usually
granted
in
this
type
of
case?
not
this
type
of
case.
a
--
a
removal
case
as
opposed
to
a
application
to
reopen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
i
understand
it.
i'm
just
saying
if
you
happen
to
know
empirically
if
most
people
who
are
facing
removal
get
stays.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
possible
in
this
case
to
kind
of
split
the
--
split
the
baby?
you
have
a
more
appealing
fact
case
than
is
typical
because
yours
involves
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
reopen
and
doesn't
really
go
to
the
ultimate
merits.
most
of
the
petitions,
i
think,
do
go
to
the
ultimate
merits,
and
it's
easier
to
see
that
(f)(2)
may
apply
there
as
opposed
to
your
case.
now,
is
there
a
coherent
way
of
saying
that?
in
other
words,
in
your
type
of
case,
you
apply
the
traditional
stay
standards,
but
in
a
case
where
the
issue
that
is
before
the
court
is
whether
to
order
removal
or
not
on
the
merits,
the
--
the
other
approach
applies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
just
really
saying
the
way
to
avoid
that
is
to
say
you
win
across
the
board.
i
mean,
it
--
my
understanding
is
that
situations
in
which
they're
going
to
be
seeking
an
injunction
to
enjoin
are
actually
quite
limited.
they're
typically
just
seeking
to
vacate
the
removal
order.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
think
i
understand
that
point
when
they're
seeking
to
have
the
order
--
the
removal
order
vacated.
but
here,
you're
seeking
the
reopening
of
the
proceedings,
which
i
guess
is
a
little
different,
isn't
it,
than
the
--
the
underlying
decision
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
right?
how
--
how
can
that
be?
i
mean,
you
have
an
order
of
removal,
and
then
you
move
to
reopen
the
proceedings.
aren't
they
two
separate
things?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
does
it
say
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
kind
of
a
systemic
challenge,
but
you
wouldn't
have
a
situation
where
you
get
an
injunction
in
far
more
typical
individual
cases.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
i'm
missing
something
but
--
and,
again,
i
don't
know
which
way
this
cuts,
but
the
dispute
strikes
me
as
very
academic
as
a
practical
matter.
judges
looking
at
whether
someone
is
likely
to
prevail
on
the
merits
versus
judges
looking
at
whether
the
person
has
shown
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
he
shouldn't
be
removed,
the
judge
that's
going
to
find
one
in
one
case,
depending
on
the
standard,
and
the
opposite
in
the
same
case
i
can't
visualize.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't?
you're
talking
about
equities
or
irreparable
harm?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
same.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
same
thing.
and
you
cannot
consider
that
at
all
under
(f)(2)?
there's
no
way
in
which
the
removal
would
be
prohibited
as
a
matter
of
law
under
provisions
that
are
concerned,
for
example,
about
whether
the
person
would
be
tortured
or
something
like
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
the
--
because
the
objection
is
on
this
procedural
matter?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
the
objection
is
that
i'm
going
to
be
tortured
and
so
you
shouldn't
order
my
removal,
he
would
be
able
to
--
a
court
under
(f)(2)
would
be
able
to
consider
that,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
don't
they
get
--
don't
they
get
to
pursue
that
even
after
they're
sent
back?
there
are
provisions
that
--
i
mean,
their
case
does
not
abate
just
because
they've
been
removed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
that's
why
--
i
guess
that
goes
back
to
my
earlier
question
is
--
i
see
that
if
they're
killed
the
case
is
probably
not
in
very
good
shape.
but
--
but
the
situations
in
which
they're
likely
to
face
that
sort
of
difficulties
upon
removal,
it
would
seem
to
me
are
these
situations
where
the
removal
would
be
prohibited
by
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
references
to
equitable
relief
and
restrain
are
clear
enough
to
cover
the
court's
authority
to
grant
a
stay?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
--
do
you
agree
with
your
friend
that
the
basic
difference
between
your
two
positions
is
that,
under
the
stay
factors,
you
are
allowed
to
consider
irreparable
harm
but
are
not
allowed
to
consider
that
under
(f)(2)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
take
it,
at
least
in
the
seventh
circuit,
these
things
are
usually
granted
stays.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
in
this
--
in
this
case
involving
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
reopen,
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
supposed
to
do
is
to
look
ahead
and
see
if
this
person
has
shown
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
they
shouldn't
be
removed.
and
if
they
haven't,
then
they
--
their
removal
can't
be
blocked
even,
for
example,
if
the
court
of
appeals
thinks,
well,
yes,
they
should
have
gotten
their
motion
to
reopen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
provision
applies
to
us
as
well,
i
take
it.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
there
is
a
cert
petition
filed
on
behalf
of
an
alien
subject
to
removal,
and
he
asks
for
a
stay
of
--
of
removal,
we
have
to
decide
whether
he
meets
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
should
have
--
we
should
have
done
this
in
this
case,
but
i
assume
you
suspended
removal
of
the
petitioner
on
your
own?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
pretty
close
to
it,
though.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
ms.
harrison,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
--
i
guess
general
kneedler's
point
is
that
clear
and
convincing
shifts
a
little,
depending
on
how
long
you've
got
to
--
to
look
at
it.
if
you've
only
got
a
day
or
a
few
hours
before
the
removal
is
going
to
take
place,
you
can
say
this
is
convincing
enough
based
on
what
i've
had
a
chance
to
look
at.
but
--
and
therefore
you
could
enter,
i
guess,
what
may
be
called
the
temporary
stay
to
get
more
briefing
from
the
government
or
whatever.
but
you
may
find
out,
when
you
look
at
it
a
little
more
deeply,
that
it's
--
it's
not
clear
and
convincing.
what
--
what's
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
harrison.
general
kneedler,
ms.
harrison,
the
court
entered
a
very
expedited
briefing
and
arguments
schedule
in
this
case
that,
unfortunately,
fell
over
the
--
the
holiday
season,
and
we
appreciate
very
much
that
this
must
have
imposed
a
burden
on
you
and
your
colleagues.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
nken
versus
holder.
the
government
may
order
that
aliens
who
are
here
illegally
be
removed
from
the
country.
there
is
a
procedure
that
the
government
has
to
go
through
before
doing
so.
that
procedure
provides
the
alien
with
certain
legal
protections.
an
alien,
who
loses
a
challenge
to
the
procedures
in
his
case
and
still
subject
to
an
order
of
removal,
can
appeal
to
a
federal
court
of
appeals
and
many
do.
but
the
order
directing
that
the
alien
be
removed
is
not
automatically
held
in
advance
while
the
appeal
is
pending.
so
that
he
has
not
taken
out
of
the
country
while
his
appeal
is
pending,
an
alien
can
seek
a
stay
of
the
removal
order,
pending
decision
of
his
appeal
and
many
do.
the
courts
of
appeals
that
consider
whether
to
grant
or
deny
the
stay,
requests
to
hold
things
up
while
they're
deciding
the
underlying
challenge,
have
developed
different
rules
about
how
to
decide
them.
the
rule
should
be
the
same
across
the
country,
so
we
granted
review
to
decide
what
it
should
be.
now,
there
is
a
well
established
general
standard
for
considering
stay
requests.
that
standard
ask
whether
the
party
seeking
the
stay
is
likely
to
succeed
on
the
merits,
whether
that
party
will
be
irreparably
injured
if
his
stay
is
denied,
were
there
other
parties
will
be
injured
if
a
stay
is
granted
and
how
the
public
interest
would
be
affected
by
the
court's
decision.
now,
the
issue
before
us
arises
because
congress,
in
1996,
passed
a
law
changing
some
of
the
removal
rules,
among
other
things,
that
law
provided
that
no
court
shall
enjoin
the
removal
of
any
alien,
unless
the
alien
shows
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
his
removal
is
prohibited
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
this
is
a
more
difficult
standard
for
the
alien
to
meet.
the
court
below
held
that
i
is
more
difficult
standard
applied
rather
thank
the
traditional
standard.
but
the
new
law
does
not
refer
to
stays,
but
rather
to
authority
to
enjoin
removal
and
although
there
is
certainly
some
overlap
between
stays
and
injunctions,
the
two
traditionally
refer
to
different
forms
of
relief.
an
injunction
is
a
coercive
order
that
directs
someone
to
do
something,
or
a
stay
operates
upon
a
judicial
proceeding
by
temporarily
divesting
in
order
under
review
of
enforceability.
the
language
instructor
of
the
new
statutory
provision
does
not
convince
us
that
enjoin
in
that
provision
was
intended
to
covers
stays.
the
authority
to
stay
a
case
pending
appeal
is
critical
to
ensure
that
a
court
can
carefully
consider
a
case
before
its
decision
is
too
late.
we
do
not
think
that
the
standard
for
injunctions
in
the
new
law
would
meet
that
need
which
causes
us
to
doubt
that
congress
meant
to
apply
the
new
standard
to
stays.
for
these
and
other
reasons
set
forth
in
our
opinion,
we
conclude
that
the
traditional
standard
is
the
right
one.
but
there
are
good
arguments
on
the
other
side,
and
they
have
been
ably
said
out
in
the
descent
filed
by
justice
alito.
at
the
end
of
the
day
however,
we
do
not
think
that
the
more
difficult
test
for
injunctions
in
the
new
law
sets
the
standard
for
stays.
it's
important
to
recognize
however
that
under
the
traditional
standard,
a
stay
is
not
a
matter
of
right.
in
exercising
its
discretion,
the
court
cannot
simply
assume
that
removal
of
the
alien
is
categorically
and
irreparable
harm,
but
that
the
balance
of
hardships
always
waves
in
the
aliens
favor.
an
alien,
who
seeks
a
stay,
bares
the
burden
of
establishing
that
he
needs
the
requirement
of
the
traditional
standard
before
the
court
should
hold
in
advance
the
publics
undeniable
interest
in
the
prompt
execution
of
removal
orders.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
consideration
of
the
can
stay
application
under
the
standards
set
forth
in
our
opinion.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
the
concurring
opinion
joined
by
justice
scalia.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
