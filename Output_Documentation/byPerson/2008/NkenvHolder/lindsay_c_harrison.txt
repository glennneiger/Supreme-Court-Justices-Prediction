ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1996,
congress
provided
in
8
u.s.c.
1252(b)(3)(b)
that
courts
may
stay
an
alien's
order
of
removal
pending
appeal.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
intended
that
temporary
stays
of
removal
be
governed
by
the
normal
standards
applicable
to
stays
or,
instead,
by
the
special
standard
that
congress
separately
set
forth
for
injunctions
in
1252(f)(2).
there
are
three
primary
reasons
why
the
normal
stay
standard
should
apply.
first,
congress
used
different
words
to
describe
these
different
forms
of
relief,
(b)(3)(b)
and
(f)(2).
congress
used
different
words
because
it
saw
these
forms
of
relief
as
different.
second
and
related,
a
stay
is,
in
fact,
different
from
an
injunction.
it
is
a
temporary
vacatur
of
a
court
or
agency
order
pending
review.
it
is
not
directed
at
a
party
and
does
not
order
a
party
to
take
action.
third,
even
an
alien
with
a
strong
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits
who
will
face
certain
persecution,
if
deported,
cannot
get
a
stay
under
the
(f)(2)
standard,
a
result
congress
should
not
be
presumed
to
authorize
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
statement
to
that
effect.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
in
--
in
a
removal
case,
stays
are
granted
in
eight
circuits
only
if
the
individual
meets
the
traditional--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--i've
seen
no
empirical
study.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
that--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--the
data
that
i
believe
your
honor
is
referencing
was
the
rate
at
which
petitions
for
review
are
filed,
and
not
the
rate
at
which
stays
are
granted
or
filed.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
again,
i've
not
seen
a
comprehensive
study.
there
are
more
petitions
filed
in
the
ninth
circuit,
but
there's
no
evidence
of
the
cause
of
that.
and
--
and
i
think
it's
important
that
stays
are,
in
fact,
denied
under
the
traditional
standard,
because
what
that
demonstrates
is
that
the
traditional
standard
effectuates
congress'
purpose
of
passing
iirira
and
eliminating
the
automatic
stay
and
making
it,
in
fact,
more
difficult
for
an
individual
to
obtain
a
stay
on
appeal.
that
--
the
traditional
standard
does
have
real
teeth
and
it
does
not
result
in
an
automatic
stay.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
at
the
same
time
in
1996.
congress
both
eliminated
the
automatic
stay,
and
it
replaced
it
with
the
language
in
1252(b)(3)(b),
which
indicates
that
a
stay
is
not
automatic
unless
a
court
orders
otherwise.
and
--
now,
that
language
was
nearly
identical
to
the
language
that
had
previously
existed,
where
a
stay
was
automatic
except
for
aggravated
felons.
for
aggravated
felons,
the
statute
provided
that
a
stay
was
not
automatic
unless
a
court
otherwise
directs.
and
courts
had
interpreted
that
language
to
provide
for
application
of
the
traditional
stay
standard.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
i
think
that
the
way
to
do
that,
your
honor,
is
to
apply
(f)(2)
where
the
alien
is
seeking
permanent
relief.
and
where
the
alien
is
seeking
to
enjoin
his
or
her
removal,
the
(f)(2)
standard
makes
a
lot
of
sense,
but
the
(f)(2)
standard
doesn't
contain
any
predictive
language.
it
doesn't--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--and
if
you
then
apply
the
(f)(2)
standard
across
the
board
to
stay
requests,
then
what
that
would
mean
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
deciding
the
merits
twice.
it's
deciding
it
at
the
outset
when
determining
whether
or
not
the
individual
is
entitled
to
a
stay,
and
then
it
is
deciding
it
again
when
the
court
decides
whether
the
individual
is
entitled
to
have
the
order
of
removal
vacated.
and
that
just
doesn't
seem
like
what
congress
had--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--technically,
the
order
of
removal
is
the
order
denying
the
motion
to
reopen,
so
they're
one
and
the
same
in
this
case
and
in
any
case
where
the
petition
for
review
is
of
an
order
of
removal,
which
is
what
the
statute
provides
for.
and
i
think
that
point
is
very
important
that
the--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--well,
the
--
the
statute
provides
that
an
order
denying
a
motion
to
reopen
is
itself
an
order
of
removal,
and
that
it's
consolidated
with
the
original
order
of
removal
on
appeal.
so
they
--
they
become
one
and
the
same
case,
and
the
order
denying
the
motion
to
reopen
is
the
order
of
removal.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
in
1252
itself,
and
i
don't
have
the
citation
for
you.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
back
to
the
point
that
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
(f)(2)
standard
contains
no
predictive
language,
it
doesn't
allow
a
court
to
say
is
this
individual
likely
to
succeed
on
the
merits.
it
says
can
this
individual
show,
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
that
the
entry
or
execution
of
the
removal
order
is
prohibited
by
law,
not
likely
to
show,
not
we
are
likely
to
find.
and
so
if
courts
were
required
to
apply
this
standard
at
the
stay
stage,
they
would
be
deciding
the
very
same
question
twice.
they
would
be
deciding
both
the
merits
question
of
whether
the
individual
removal
order
is
prohibited
by
law
and
also
the
stay
question
of
whether
it
should
be
stayed
pending--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--well,
your
honor,
the
government
has
stated
in
its
brief
that
it
--
it
believes
these
two
standards
to
be
virtually
identical.
and
in
the
event
that
a
stay
was
granted,
it
would
certainly
render
the
merits
decision
superfluous
because,
if
a
stay
was
granted
and
you
can
meet
this
higher
burden,
then,
perforce,
you
could
meet
the
lower
burden.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
and
so,
in
that
situation,
(b)(3)(b)
would
be
superfluous.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
it
covers
any
time
an
alien
seeks
an
injunction,
now,
both
in
the
courts
of
appeals
and
in
a
district
court
case.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
well,
the
catholic
social
services
case
is
one
example
where
individuals
were
challenging
the
procedures
whereby
their
legalization
applications
were
adjudicated
under
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act.
and
in
that
case,
they
sought
injunctive
relief
as
a
class
to
enjoin
their
removal
pending
that
case
and
--
and
permanently,
in
fact,
because
they
said
they
were
entitled
to
legalization,
which
was
an
amnesty
statute.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
well,
if
an
individual
in
that
case,
your
honor,
attempted
to
enjoin
his
or
her
removal,
then
the
(f)(2)
standard
would
certainly
apply
to
that
individual.
and
there's
--
there's
no
reason
why
an
individual
couldn't
have
brought
that
challenge
as
opposed
to
a
class.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
well,
in
that
case,
it
would
be
in
a
district
court,
which
doesn't
have
supervisory
authority
over
the
court
of
appeals
--
i'm
sorry
--
over
the
bia's
order.
and
so
the
district
court
presumably
couldn't
stay
an
order
that
it
wasn't
reviewing.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
well,
he
perhaps
might,
but
if
there
was
a
delay
in
the
--
in
the
procedure
or
if
there
was
some
reason
why--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--well,
it
would
be
in
any
case,
even
in
the
court
of
appeals,
where
an
individual
sought
an
injunction
as
opposed
to
a
stay.
for
example,
if
it
was
a
situation
like
the
singh
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
where
there
was
a
stay
of
removal
in
place,
but
the
agency
was
deporting
the
individual
anyway.
then
the
individual
would
need
to
obtain
an
injunction,
and
in
fact
that
was
essentially
what
the
ninth
circuit
ordered,
was
a
remand
for
the
imposition
of
an
injunction
against--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--no,
your
honor.
i
think--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--the
singh
case,
your
honor,
is
--
is
one
of
those
cases.
there's
also
the
lindstrom
case
from
the
seventh
circuit.
and
--
and
it
does
--
it
does
happen
that
either
because
of
a
miscommunication
or
--
or
some
other
reason,
that
the
stay
is
not
effective,
and
in
that
case
an
injunction
would
be.
and
i
think,
in
order
to
address
the
court's
concern
that
--
that
(f)(2)
was
a
fluke,
it's
important
to
take
a
look
at
where
it
appears
in
the
statute
and
--
and
its
context.
now,
originally,
the
statute
contained
only
(f)(1),
which
says
that
you
cannot
obtain
injunctions
as
a
class,
but
that
individuals
can
obtain
injunctions.
there
was
no
(f)(2).
the
bill
went
to
conference
and
then
congress
added
in
(f)(2),
i
think
to
make
very
clear
that,
although
they
had
carved
out
this
exception
in
(f)(1)
for
individual
cases,
that
it
was
not
to
be
granted
as
a
matter
of
course,
that
even
in
particular
cases,
which
is
the
subtitle
of
(f)(2),
the
standard
should
be
very
strict.
and
so
i
think
congress
saw
itself
as
closing
a
potential
hole
here,
because
it
had
created
this
opportunity
to
obtain
an
injunction
as
an
individual
without
articulating
a
standard.
then
congress
went
about
articulating
a
standard
in
(f)(2).
and
it's
a
very
high
standard.
now,
congress
did
not
cross-reference
(b)(3)(b),
which
is
the
stay
provision,
and
in
fact,
in
the
transitional
rules,
what
congress
did
was
it
only
--
it
only
included
a
provision
that
was
identical
to
(b)(3)(b).
it
did
not
include
(f)(2)
in
the
transitional
rules,
which
--
all
of
which
demonstrate
that
congress
did
not
see
(f)(2)
and
(b)(3)(b)
as
related.
they
saw
them
as
separate
with
(f)(2)
governing
injunctions
and
(b)(3)(b)
governing
stays.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
well,
the
--
the
key
i
believe,
your
honor,
is
the
--
the
equities.
now,
the
(f)(2)
standard
does
not
permit
consideration
of
the
equities
in
determining
whether
removal
is
prohibited
by
law.
the--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--both
--
both,
your
honor.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
yes.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
well
--
well,
your
honor,
under
the
(f)(2)
standard
--
take,
for
example,
someone
who
had
applied
for
asylum,
and
it
was
denied
on
a
procedural
technicality,
and
the
question
is,
was
the
entry
of
the
execution
--
entry
or
execution
of
the
removal
order
prohibited
by
law?
but
that
--
the
issue
of
whether
the
technicality
was
a
--
was
a
correct
finding
or
was
not
a
correct
finding
permits
no
consideration
of
whether
or
not
that
individual,
if
they
are
deported,
is
going
to
face
persecution,
torture,
death,
et
cetera.
only
under
the
--
the
traditional
standard.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
correct.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
unless
the
very
question
that
was
being
decided
is
whether
the
individual
had
met
the
--
met
the
standard
for
relief
under
the
convention
against
torture.
but
there
are
also
cases
where
an
individual
is
seeking
asylum,
and
there's
questions
about
whether
--
whether
the
persecution
is
on
the
basis
of
a
protected
class.
now,
the
question
there
is
not
whether
or
not
the
person
is
likely
to
suffer
irreparable
harm
if
they
go
back,
but,
rather,
what
is
the
basis
on
which
they
may
be
entitled
to
asylum?
and
so
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
however,
their
case
may
abate
because
they
are
killed,
they
are
put
in
jail,
they're
not
in
a
position
to
come
back
to
this
country.
and
that
is
why
consideration
of
the
equities
in
this
context
is
so
critical
and
why
congress
would
not
have
eliminated
the
equities
from
the
consideration
without
a
very
clear
statement.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
well,
your
honor,
that
would
--
the
court
of
appeals
would
only
be
allowed
to
consider
that
if
the
question
presented
was
whether
they
had
proven
that
they
were
likely
to
be
killed
if
they
were
returned
to
the
country.
but
that
often
is
not
what
the
--
the
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
deciding.
it's
deciding
a
procedural
question.
it's
deciding
whether
the
persecution
was
on
the
basis
of
a
protected
class,
those
sorts
of
considerations,
which
are
not
the
same
question
as:
is
this
person
likely
to
be
killed
if
they're
returned?
that's
why
--
that's
why
the
--
this
court
has
held
that
unless
congress
demonstrates
very
clearly
that
it
intends
to
take
away
the
court's
ability
to
consider
the
equities,
that
we
don't
interpret
congress'--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--well,
not
always,
your
honor,
if
the
question
that
the
court
was
considering
wasn't
whether
in
fact
the
individual
was
going
to
be
killed
if
returned.
if
the
question
the
court
is
considering
is
whether
--
whether
a
crime
he
has
committed
subjects
the
individual
to
deportation,
then
the
fact
that
that
individual
is
going
to
be
killed
when
he
is
returned
to
the
country
is
not
part
of
the
(f)(2)
calculus.
and
--
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
government
has
--
has
argued
that
the
equities
would
be
part
of
the
consideration.
the
government
has
argued
that
for
legal
--
for
factual
questions,
you
need
to
prove
them
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
for
legal
questions
you
need
to
prove
you're
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
where
the
equities
fall
into
that
calculus
is
--
is
unclear,
and
i
think
they
would
only
fall
into
that
calculus
if
the
very
question
presented
to
the
court
was
that
one.
and
--
and,
moreover--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
that
itself
would
be
an
equity.
but
the
fact
that
he
does
have
a
wife
and
he
does
have
a
young
child
in
this
country
would
be
a
permissible
consideration
in
the
equitable
analysis,
in
the
analysis
of
--
of
irreparable
harm
that
would
come
to
him
and
his
family.
the
--
the
basis
for
his
motion
to
reopen
was
not
the
denial
of
adjustment
--
of
his
adjustment
of
his
status.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
also
think
that
--
that
it's
important
to
emphasize
this
court's
clear-statement
rule,
which
is
that
the
court
doesn't
take
lightly
statutes
that
do
not
very,
very
clearly
take
away
the
power
of
the
courts
to
grant
the
stay,
to
grant
an
injunction.
and
if
it's
not
very
clear
from
the
face
of
the
statute
that
that
is
what
congress
intended,
that
the
court
will
not
interpret
as
having
done
so.
i
also
think
that
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
when
congress
wanted
to
be
expansive
in
getting
rid
of
forms
of
equitable
relief,
it
was.
in
1252(e)(1)(a),
for
example,
which,
if
you'd
like
to
look,
appears
on
page
11a
of
the
appendix
to
the
gray
brief,
that's
the
provision
where
congress
limited
the
forms
of
equitable
relief
available
to
aliens
facing
removal
in
expedited
situations.
and
there
congress'
language
was
very
clear,
that
said
no
declaratory
injunctive
or
other
equitable
relief.
there's
no
language
of
that
sort
in
(f)(2).
same
with
(f)(1).
in
that
provision,
congress
said
no
court
in
--
in
a
class
situation
can
enjoin
or
restrain
the
removal
of
an
alien.
not
in
(f)(2).
in
(f)(2)
congress
only
used
the
word
"enjoin"
in
its
omission
of
other
equitable
relief,
and
its
omission
of
restrain
are
instructive.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
i
don't
believe
that
restrain
is,
your
honor,
because
i
think
restrain
--
it's
unclear
whether
congress
is
talking
about
a
--
a
stay
versus
a
temporary
injunction
or
a
restraining
order.
i
think
other
equitable
relief
does
capture
stays
because
we
don't
deny
that
a
stay
is
a
form
of
equitable
relief.
it's
simply
not
an
injunction
because
it's
not
directed
at
a
party
and
it
doesn't
order
a
party
to
do
something.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
that
test
is
the
same,
your
honor,
in
the
usual
situation
because
both
arise
at
the
same
stage
in
the
proceedings
where
it
makes
sense
that
a
court
would
want
to
consider
what
is
the
likelihood
that
this
person
is
going
to
succeed
down
the
road.
what
--
what
is
the
risk
if
i
don't
grant
relief
at
this
stage?
but
those
two
things
are
also
treated
as
different
in
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
in
rule
8
and
also
rule
18,
which
governs
only
stays
of
agency
orders,
not
injunctions.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
standard
that
congress
intended,
the
traditional
one,
is
not
a
standard
under
which
stays
are
--
are
routinely
granted.
they
--
they've
been
denied
in
some
of
the
very
cases
where
the
circuits
decided
whether
(f)(2)
applies
or
--
or
whether
the
traditional
standard
applies.
and
this
court
has
given
guidance,
for
example,
this
term
in
winter,
that
you
have
to
--
not
just
show
some
likelihood
of
--
of
suffering
irreparable
harm,
but
you
have
to
show
a
strong
probability
both
of
success
on
the
merits,
and
you
have
to
show
a
strong
probability
of
irreparable
harm.
and
so
if
down
the
road
it
seems
that
courts
are
not
faithfully
implementing
that
standard,
then
the
court
could
again
provide
guidance
to
that
effect.
but
i
don't
think
that--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--that's
right,
your
honor.
and
--
and
it
very
well
could,
and
we
feel
we
are
entitled,
obviously,
to
make
that
showing
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
have
the
fourth
circuit
apply
the
traditional
test
and
make
a
decision
under
that
test
in
the
first
instance.
but
it's
true
that
the
stay
could
be
denied,
and
that
there
is
no
guarantee.
it
is
not
automatic.
and
that's
why
i
think
before
'96
congress
used
the
same
language
for
aggravated
felons
then
that
it
does
now
for
everyone.
because
it
knew
that
"unless
a
court
otherwise
directs"
doesn't
mean
automatic.
it
means
that
only
where
there's
a
likelihood
of
success
and
where
the
equities
counsel
in
--
in
favor
of
a
stay,
it
should
be
granted.
that's
also
how
this
court
interpreted
that
similar
language
in
hilton
in
interpreting
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
23(c),
which
concerns
a
stay
of
a
grant
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
appeal.
this
court
said
that
the
traditional
stay
standard
should
apply
in
that
situation
interpreting
virtually
the
same
language
that
congress
then
chose
to
use
in
this
provision,
(b)(3)(b).
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
start
with
the
point
that
the
government
contends
that
this
court
or
any
court
of
appeals
could
impose
a
stay
to
consider
the
stay
motion.
and,
respectfully,
i
don't
believe
that
is
consistent
with
the
text
of
(f)(2),
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
government
must
stray
from
the
text
is
a
sign
of
how
absurd
the
results
would
be
if
(f)(2)
were
applied
to
stays.
now,
the
reason
they
must
stray
from
the
text
is
that
the
text
says
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law.
"
which
means
notwithstanding
the
hobbs
act
and
notwithstanding
the
all
writs
act,
which
is
where
i
believe
my
brother
was
indicating
this
court
would
get
the
authority
to
impose
such
a
stay.
now,
i
think
the
fact
that
there
are
cases
where
such
a
need
would
arise,
as
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
is
exactly
why
this
court
applies
a
presumption
against
interpreting
statutes
as
--
as
restricting
the
equitable
authority
of
the
courts,
unless
there
is
a
clear
statement
to
the
contrary,
which--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--well,
your
honor,
the
(f)(2)--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--well,
that's
true,
your
honor.
you'd
have
to
show
likelihood
of
success.
but
in
--
in
the
situation
where
you
could
consider
the
equities,
if
the
equities
were
--
were
strong
enough
and
--
and
demonstrated
in
the
stay
application,
then
it
wouldn't
be
difficult
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
the
balance
of
the
factors
justified
imposing
a
stay
in
that
situation.
under
(f)(2),
the
court
would
have
to
decide
the
question
outright.
and,
again,
(f)(2)
does
not
just
mean
any
predictive
language.
it
just
says,
has
the
individual
demonstrated
and
shown
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
removal
is
prohibited
by
law?
under
the
traditional
standard,
there
is
a
--
the
court
is
allowed
to
consider
whether
the
individual
is
likely
to
show
success
on
the
merits.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
well,
your
honor,
i
heard
my
brother
as
indicating
that
if
you
meet
the
(f)(2)
standard,
then
--
then
the
court
can
consider
the
equities
so
as
to
deprive
the
individual
of
a
stay,
but
that
if
you
cannot
meet
the
(f)(2)
standard,
then
the
question
is
closed
and
there
is
no
consideration.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
event
that
the
individual
does
not
meet
(f)(2).
if
the
individual
meets
(f)(2),
then
i
do
believe
the
court
would
go
on
to
consider
the
equities.
but
in
the
event
that
the
individual
has
met
the
(f)(2)
standard,
the
court
can
simply
grant
the
petition
on
the
merits,
and
there
is
no
need
to
go
about
considering
the
equities
because
the
individual
has
shown
that
--
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
that
removal
is
prohibited
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
that's
the
second
point
i
want
to
get
to,
which
is
your
honor's
question
about,
isn't
this
a
standard
that
sounds
a
lot
more
like
it
is
directed
at
district
courts
because
--
i
think
you
are
right,
your
honor.
and
i
think
it
does
sound
like
that
standard
because
i
do
think
that
was
where
it
was
intended
to
apply.
and
the
--
the
phrase
"under
this
section"
does
not
modify
the
word
"enjoin".
it
modifies
the
word
"final
order
of
removal".
and
to
ascribe
the
government's
reading
to
it
would
require
you
to
move
that
phrase
from
where
congress
placed
it
in
the
statute
to
after
the
word
"enjoin".
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
well,
your
honor,
if
the
court
were
to
interpret
clear
and
convincing
as
a
more
flexible
standard,
then
--
then
i
don't
think
--
you
know,
i
don't
disagree
with
--
with
your
honor's
characterization
of
it.
but
i
still
think
that,
regardless
of
how
you
interpret
clear
and
convincing,
that
the
equities
would
not
be
part
of
the
calculus.
and
--
and
i
also
think
that
the
fact
that
clear
and
convincing
sounds
like
a
standard
congress
would
have
addressed
to
district
courts,
the
fact
that
(f)(2)
says
no
court,
not
--
not
just
the
courts
of
appeals,
the
fact
that
it
references
an
alien
and
not
a
petitioner,
and
the
fact
that
it's
addressed
to
instances
where
the
entry
or
execution
is
prohibited
by
law
as
opposed
to
the
order
itself
being
unlawful
are
all
signs
that
congress
intended
this
provision
to
apply
both
in
the
district
courts
and
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
and
i
would
also
note
that
(a)(5),
which
is
a
provision
the
government
pointed
to,
was
not
in
the
'96
statute.
it
was
added
in
2005,
and
the
constitutionality
of
that
provision
continues
to
be
litigated.
and,
moreover,
there
are
habeas
cases
in
the
district
court
that
persist
where
(f)(2)
has
real
application
and
where
congress'
intent
that
an
injunction
--
not
a
stay,
but
an
injunction
--
be
very
difficult
to
obtain--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--yes,
sir.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
i
believe
you're
right,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that--
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
--i
did
not
mention
it
in
my
opening,
your
honor,
and
that
was
my
error.
i
believe
habeas
is
one
example
--
and
habeas
in
the
expedited
removal
context,
where
the
provision
would
apply.
and
--
and
i
think,
as
this
court
made
clear
in
st.
cyr,
congress
did
intend
for
some
habeas
actions
to
persist
in
the
'96
iirira
statute.
and
in
those
cases,
(f)(2)
would
apply,
would
have
real
impact.
and
i
would
also
note
that
if
the
court
were
to
accept
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
term
"enjoin",
that
it
only
applies
in
stays
and
that
it
doesn't
have
application
elsewhere,
then
you'd
be
required
to
interpret
congress'
use
of
the
word
"enjoin"
to
be
not
merely
inclusive
of
stays
but
as
coterminous
with
the
--
with
the
word
"stay".
but
congress
didn't
use
the
word
(f)(2).
it
used
the
word
"enjoin".
and
the
fact
that
that
word
choice
was
different
from
the
word
it
used
in
(b)(3)(b)
i
think
is
a
clear
indication
that
congress
had
something
different
in
mind.
it
didn't
cross-reference
"stays".
it
didn't
use
the
word
"stays",
and
it
articulated
a
standard
that
seems
more
appropriate
for
district
courts
adjudicating
permanent
injunctive
relief
than
courts
of
appeals
hearing
a
temporary
application
for
a
stay.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
yes,
your
honor.
there
--
there
is
overlap,
and
the
standard
that
is
applied
by
the
courts,
if
there
is
no
statute
to
the
contrary,
is
the
same.
but
here,
congress
expressed
an
intent
to
treat
injunctive
relief
differently
and
articulated
a
standard
that
was
higher
for
injunctive
relief.
ms.
lindsay
c.
harrison
yes,
your
honor.
