justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
--
did
the
government
cite
--
i
can
ask
you.
i
thought
the
government
said
that
an
empirical
database
would
be
the
ninth
circuit,
which
has
the
more
generous
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
my
understanding
is
that
stays
are
granted
in
a
very
high
percentage
of
those
cases.
i'd
be
curious
to
know,
a,
the
percentage
of
the
cases
in
which
it's
granted;
and
b,
the
percentage
of
those
cases
that
are
ultimately
decided
in
favor
of
the
government?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
true
that
there
are
more
petitions
filed
in
the
--
in
the
courts
with
the
more
generous
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
to
refresh
my
recollection,
what
--
what's
the
major
difference
between
the
standard
that
--
or
the
findings
that
the
judge
must
make,
a,
to
grant
a
preliminary
injunction
and,
b,
to
grant
a
stay?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
--
my
concern
is
that
i
sense
in
this
statute
a
congressional
concern
that
stays
are
too
frequently
granted.
and
one
thing
we
could
do,
if
we
were
to
accept
your
view
of
the
statute,
is
to
say,
and
you
must
be
very
careful.
well,
the
courts
don't
listen
to
that
very
much.
and
short
of
granting
the
--
accepting
the
government's
position,
i
don't
know
what
you
could
do
if
there
were
a
--
a
submission
and
understanding
that
stays
were
being
granted
routinely
and
too
frequently.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
other
cases
in
which
clear
and
convincing
--
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
applies
to
appellate
courts?
it
seems
to
me
clear
and
convincing
is
more
appropriate
for
a
factual
determination
at
the
trial
court
level.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
you
still
have
a
differential.
on
--
on
the
friday-to-monday-night
hypothetical,
you
wouldn't
apply,
or
would
you,
the
same
standard
that
you
would
apply
on
monday
for
the
next
--
after
cert
on
monday
for
the
next
year
and
a
half?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
you
have
the
same
problem
under
your
standard
as
the
government
does
under
its.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
that
if
you
do
not
prevail,
and
we
say
clear
and
convincing
evidence
is
the
standard,
that
courts
are
not
entitled
to
consider
equities?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
about
your
position.
is
it
your
contention
that
if
we
grant
--
if
we
determine
that
clear
and
convincing
is
the
standard,
that
equities
are
not
relevant
to
that
calculus?
