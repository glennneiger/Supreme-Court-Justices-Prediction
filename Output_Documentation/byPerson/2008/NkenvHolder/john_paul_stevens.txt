justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i'm
just
not
following
it.
but
i
have
the
same
difficulty
that
perhaps
the
chief
justice
is
trying
to
get
at.
in
a
case
where
it
appears
to
the
--
the
judge
that
the
--
that
the
alien
would
be
murdered
when
he
was
returned,
wouldn't
his
--
his
deportation
be
prohibited
by
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
when
we
entered
the
stay,
did
we
violate
(f)(2)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
where
do
we
get
that
authority
if
(f)(2)
means
what
you
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this
one
very
quick?
do
you
understand
--
is
it
your
understanding
of
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
our
stay
in
this
case
violated
the
statute?
