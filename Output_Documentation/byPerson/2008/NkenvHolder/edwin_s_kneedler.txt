mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statutory
text,
context,
and
background
of
section
1252(f)(2)
all
demonstrate
that
that
section
applies
to
orders
granting
a
stay
of
removal
pending
a
court
of
appeals
decision
on
a
petition
for
review.
indeed,
if
section
1252(f)(2)
does
not
apply
to
such
an
order
barring
removal,
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
function
it
would
serve.
now,
petitioner's
counsel
has
suggested
that
1252(f)(2)
must
be
directed
to
what
i
think
had
been
referred
to
as
fluke
kind
of
district
court
orders,
and
couldn't
really
be
directed
at
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
there
are
two
very
powerful
responses
to
that,
if
i
make
--
may
make
them
both.
the
first
is
that
subsection
(f)(2),
which
appears
on
page
14a
of
our
brief,
refers
--
it
says
no
court
shall
enjoin
the
removal,
et
cetera,
under
this
section,
meaning
that
the
provision
is
specifically
directed
to
court
orders
that
are
entered
as
part
of
the
proceedings
on
judicial
review
of
final
orders
under
section
1252.
it's
not
--
it's
not
principally
directed
at
collateral
orders
that
might
arise
in
some
other
class
action
or
other
sort
of
suit.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
--
i
think
there
were
two
different
types
of
examples
that
she
gave,
if
i
may.
i
think
the
first
one
was
a
situation
where
a
--
a
department
of
homeland
security
officer
might
have
erroneously
carried
out
an
order
of
removal
not
realizing
that
there
was
a
--
a
stay
entered.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
--
the
cited
cases,
we
don't
think,
are
examples
of
--
of
this.
(f)(2)
was
not
at
issue
in
those
--
in
those
cases.
the
question
in
several
of
them
was
whether
the
separate
provision
1252(g),
which
this
court
discussed
in
the
american-arab
case,
whether
that
applied,
and
there
was
--
at
least
one
of
the
cases
involved
the
transitional
rules
under
which
(f)(2)
doesn't
apply.
but
i
think
the
--
the
more
fundamental
answer
to
your
point
was
the
second
point
that
i
was
--
that
i
was
going
to
make.
there
are
--
there
are
three
provisions
of
section
1252
that
make
unmistakably
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
any
challenge
to
a
final
order
of
removal,
any
form
of
judicial
review
which
would
include
an
injunction
to
take
place
outside
of
1252
itself.
and
1252(a)(1)
provides
that
judicial
review
shall
be
pursuant
to
chapter
158
of
--
and
that's
on
page
1a
of
the
brief
--
shall
be
pursuant
to
chapter
158
of
title
28,
the
hobbs
judicial
review
act.
but
--
and
then
(a)(5),
which
is
on
page
4a
of
our
brief,
says
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
a
petition
for
review
filed
with
an
appropriate
court
is
the
sole
and
exclusive
means
for
judicial
review
of
the
removal
order.
unless
there
be
any
doubt,
the
last
sentence
in
that
section
says,
for
purposes
of
this
entire
chapter,
anytime
there's
a
reference
to
judicial
review,
it
refers
to
any
sort
of
statutory
or
nonstatutory
provision.
so
anytime
an
alien
would
try
to
get
an
injunction
in
any
form
of
judicial
review,
congress
has
expressly
barred
it
not
only
by
this,
but
then
also
by
section
(b)(9)
--
subsection
(b)(9).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
if
i
could.
1225(b)(1)
governs
the
special
--
what's
called
expedited
removal.
it's
a
special
procedure,
as
--
as
you
identified,
for
people
essentially
knocking
at
the
door,
and
it
has
very
limited
review,
as
you
suggested.
almost
everything
is
unreviewable
except
possibility
of
asylum.
but
it's
--
that
is
the
only
provision
for
district
court
review.
it
is
the,
shall
we
say,
functional
equivalent
of
a
petition
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
everybody
else.
congress
just
decided
to
have
two
different
--
two
separate
procedures.
and
i
think
for
1225(b)(1)
it's
really
a
carryover
orders
of
exclusion
prior
to
1996.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
no,
it
does
--
it
does
say
--
it
does
say
habeas,
but
(f)
--
there's
no
suggestion
that
(f),
either
(1),
which
is
of
general
application,
or
(f)(2)
in
particular,
is
limited
to
subsection
(e).
it
--
it
speaks
of
any
injunction.
and
--
and
that's
instructive
because
the
--
the
term
"injunction"
is
used
in
the
hobbs
judicial
review
act
to
describe
an
interlocutory
order
by
a
court
of
appeals
on
judicial
review
that
suspends
the
enforcement
of
an
agency
order
pending
judicial
review.
and
we
--
we
quote
the
hobbs
judicial
review
act
in
our
brief.
and
as
i
mentioned
before,
that
is
very
important
to
understand
here,
because
congress
provided
--
other
than
the
habeas
review
for
this
special
category,
justice
breyer,
congress
provided
that
judicial
review
in
the
norm
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
pursuant
to
the
hobbs
act.
and
if
you
look
at
the
hobbs
act
provision
for
interlocutory
stays,
it
--
it
refers
to
interlocutory
relief
as
an
injunction.
it
uses
the
word--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
the
habeas
court
would
have
the
authority
and
--
would
have
the
authority
to
vacate
just
as
--
just
as
a
court
of
appeals
would
have
the
authority
to
vacate.
but
my
--
my
basic
point
is
both
of
them
are
--
are
forms
of
judicial
review.
and
if
this
heightened
injunction
standard
applies
to
the
form
of
judicial
review
that
congress
has
decided
to
leave
in
habeas,
then
there
is
no
reason
to
imagine
why
congress
wouldn't
want
the
same
injunctive
standard
to
apply
to
somebody
who's
seeking
judicial
review
in
the
normal
way
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
especially
since
congress
used
the
word
"injunction"
to
describe
this
very
sort
of
interlocutory
relief
under
the
hobbs
judicial
review
act
when
--
when
a
person
seeks
judicial
review
in
a
--
in
a
court
of
appeals.
and
this
conforms
to
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
"enjoin",
which
is
to
prohibited
something,
to
require
a
party
to
abstain
from
carrying
out
an
act.
well,
that's
exactly
what
a
stay
of
removal
does.
it
bars--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
think
(f)(2)
--
(f)(2)
is
--
is
a
necessary
condition
for
granting
relief.
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
eliminate
the
requirement
that
an
alien
show
--
show
harm
from
the
--
from
the
removal.
it's
--
it's
a
condition--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
that
--
and
that
--
and
that
may
--
that
may
well
be.
i
think
it
may
well
be
in
the
typical
case.
if
i
--
if
i
could
just--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
as
we
understand
the
reference
to
clear
and
convincing
evidence
--
and
admittedly
it's
not
entirely
clear
how
congress
intended
that
standard
to
apply
in
this
context.
as
we
understand
it,
it
is
--
it
is
a
standard
of
review
slightly
more
favorable
to
the
alien
than
the
substantial
evidence
review
standard,
which
is
what
would
apply
on
--
on
final--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
but
--
but
in
no
event,
even
on
review
of
the
final
order,
is
--
is
the
court
reviewing
for
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
court
is
reviewing
the
case
on
the
administrative
record
under
the
substantial
evidence
test,
in
which
case
the
court
at
final
judgment
cannot
set
aside
the
--
the
agency
order,
except
--
unless
it
finds
that
no
reasonable
fact-finder
could
conclude
that
the
order
should
stand.
that's
the
substantial
evidence
test.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
--
that
is
--
the
court
--
you're
--
you're
correct
in
the
sense
that
the
court
is
reviewing
to
see
whether
substantial
evidence
supports
the
ij's
determination
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
but
(f)(2)
is
written
in
terms
of
the
sort
of
showing
that
the
alien
must
make
to
the
court,
and
--
and
not
--
not
what
he
would
have
made
to
the
ij.
and
as
we
--
as
we
read
it,
as
we
try
to
apply
the
language
in
the
context
of
a
stay,
we
think
that
means
that
the
alien
must
show
something
a
little
bit
short
of
--
of
the
substantial
evidence,
that
no
reasonable
fact-finder
could
find
it,
at
least
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
it's
--
that
the
ij
was
incorrect
or
that
the
alien
has
a
successful
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
--
it
--
it
ordinarily
is.
and
that
--
and
that's
why
the
phrasing,
as
i
was
trying
to
discuss
with
justice
souter,
i
think,
is
a
little
awkward.
another
possible
way
to
think
about
it
--
and
this
may
be
what
congress
was
really
driving
at.
when
it
was
--
when
it
was
saying
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
it
really
meant
a
clear
and
convincing
showing,
that
the
--
that
the
courts
shouldn't
take
this
too
casually.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
seventh
circuit
has
a
standard
that
the
alien
just
has
to
show
more
than
a
negligible
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits
to
prevail.
well,
that
--
that's
way
below
what
even
the
traditional
standard
would
be.
so
it's
possible
to
read
clear
and
convincing
evidence
as
really
driving
at
clear
and
convincing
showing,
which
is
language
that
is
--
that
is
somewhat
reminiscent
of
what
this
court
has
said
for
preliminary
injunctions
generally.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they're
--
we
do
not
have
empirical
data
--
and
--
and
i
wish
we
did
--
on
the
percentage.
but
they
are
--
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
our
experience
--
again,
we
don't
have
percentages,
but
they
are
granted
quite
frequently.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
the
--
if
the
courts
actually
applied
that
standard,
there
would
at
least
be
some
improvement
in
the
stay
standards,
but
the
--
but
the
courts
sometimes
apply
a
sliding
scale
where
they
say
if
there's
--
you
know,
a
serious
question
and
a
showing
--
a
showing
of
substantial
harm
would
be
sufficient.
well,
this
court
has
twice
reaffirmed
in
the
--
in
the
last
term
--
last
term
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
the
eleventh.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
would
be
the
court
of
appeals,
not
the
district
judge.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
it
--
we
--
we
believe
that
the
--
that
1252(f)(2)
allows
a
court
to
take
the
time
necessary
to
rule
meaningfully
on
the
stay
application.
we
do
not
believe
congress
intended
to
divest
the
court
of
the
ability
to
rule
on
the
merits.
it
has
a
substantive
standard
that
the
alien
has
to
make
a
clear
and
--
has
to
show
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
it
--
it
presupposes
that
the
alien
has
to
make
a
showing.
therefore,
it
presupposes
that
the
court
must
be
able
to
evaluate
that
showing.
we
also
believe
that
it
presupposes
that
the
government
is
permitted
to
respond
to
it.
so
we
--
we
do
not
object
and
have
not
objected
in
the
lower
courts
to
the
courts
taking
sufficient
time
to
--
to
freeze
the
status
quo
by
issuing
a
--
a
short
stay
if
necessary
to
do
that.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
for
example,
which
has
operated
under
this
heightened
showing
for
some
period
of
time,
it
tends
to
work
out,
because
when
a
--
a
petition
for
review
and
stay
application
is
granted,
the
court
contacts
the
office
of
immigration
litigation
which
works
with
dhs
to
inform
the
court
of
how
soon
the
--
the
order
might
be
issued,
and
then
the
court
is
aware
of
how
quickly
it
might
act.
so
--
so
it
wouldn't
often
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
do
it,
but
we
did
not
challenge
that
authority.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
are
two
responses.
one,
we
--
we
think
it's
necessarily
implicit
in
the
statutory
framework
that
congress
would
have
wanted
the
court
to
be
able
to
rule
on
the
--
on
the
interlocutory
injunction.
but
the
--
but
the
second
point
i
think
that
--
that
reinforces
this
proposition
--
again,
if
you
go
back
to
the
hobbs
judicial
review
act,
it
has
a
provision
not
only
for
interlocutory
injunctions,
which
is
what
we're
really
talking
about
here,
but
a
provision
for
temporary
--
for
a
court
to
issue
a
temporary
stay
upon
a
showing
of
irreparable
injury
to
allow
the
status
quo
to
be
maintained
pending
the
court's
ruling
on
the
interlocutory
injunction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
may
--
that
may
well
be
the
right
answer,
is
to
read
(b)(3)(b)
--
(b)(3)(b)'s
opening
that
--
which
says
a
petition
for
review
does
not
in
itself
stay
the
order
--
is
--
is
very
similar
to
the
language
in
the
opening
of
2349(b)
which
is
the
interlocutory
injunction
language
of
the
hobbs
judicial
review
act.
it
says
the
mere
filing
of
the
petition
doesn't
stay
or
suspend
the
order.
it
says
stay
or
suspend
the
order
like
this
says
stay,
and
then
it
says,
but
a
court
may
--
i
forget
the
precise
language
--
restrain
or
suspend
the
order
pending
judicial
review,
and
it
refers
to
that
as
an
interlocutory
injunction.
but
it
says
if
the
petitioner
shows
irreparable
injury
would
occur
before
the
court
has
a
chance
to
rule
even
on
the
interlocutory
injunction,
it
can
issue
what's
called
a
temporary
stay
to
maintain
the
status
quo
until
it
can
look
at
the
--
at
the
interim
relief.
well,
if
--
if
that
--
if
that
background
rule
is
not
displaced,
that
would
allow
for
some
separation
of
the
sort
of
emergency
motion
for
a
stay,
a
hold-fast
sort
of
situation,
for
the
court
to
be
able
to
evaluate
the
merits.
but
when
it
gets
to
what
the
hobbs
act
refers
to
as
an
injunction,
then
(f)(2)
kicks
in
the
interlocutory
injunction
pending
--
pending
judicial
review.
so
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
an
underlying
statutory
basis
for
allowing
the
court
to
--
to
issue
a
temporary
order
to
allow
the
--
to
allow
the
proceeding
to
go
forward,
but
we
think
that
that
should
be
done
in
a
timely
way.
the
hobbs
judicial
review
act
contemplates
a
rather
casual,
up
to
60
days
that
such
a
temporary
stay
should
remain
in
effect.
we
think
in
many
cases,
under
the
immigration
laws,
the
court
should
be
able
to
act
on
the
stay
application
more
quickly
than
that.
i
did
want
--
i
did
also
want
to
stress
the
--
the
policy
purposes
that
justice
kennedy
raised
in
a
--
in
an
earlier
question,
and
that
is
the
--
the
thrust
--
the
whole
thrust
of
the
1996
amendments
to
the
immigration
act
was
to
expedite
the
removal
of
aliens,
particularly
criminal
aliens,
but
not
all
--
but
all
aliens
in
fact.
and
congress
did
several
things
when
it
did
that.
it
repealed
the
prior
provision
that
said
the
mere
filing
of
petition
for
review
automatically
stayed
the
removal
unless
the
court
ordered
--
ordered
otherwise.
and
it
also
repealed
the
prior
provision
that
said
that
the
alien
--
if
the
alien
left
the
country,
including
--
that
was
construed
to
mean
pursuant
to
deportation
order,
he
could
no
longer
challenge
the
removal
order
outside
the
country.
congress
completely
changed
that
and
it
said
you
can
now
challenge
the
order
of
removal
from
outside
the
country,
and
it
basically
reversed
the
presumption
with
respect
to
whether
--
whether
the
filing
of
a
petition
for
review
stays
--
stays
the
order
of
removal.
congress
said,
no,
it
does
not
unless
the
court
ordered
otherwise.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
(f)(1)
is
directed
at
--
in
large
part
at
programmatic
challenges.
it
provides
a
--
it
prohibits
courts
from
enjoining
or
restraining
the
operation
of
part
4
of
the
ina
which
--
which
is
the
provision
that
deals
with
deportation
--
adjudication
of
deportation
and
exclusions
and
carrying
out
those
orders,
which,
by
the
way,
we
think
is
the
reason
it
says
enjoin
or
restrain
because
it's
talking
about
programmatic
type
actions.
and
restrain
--
the
word
(f)(2)
because
it
--
because
what's
being
enjoined
or
stayed
is
a
very
discreet
act.
you
either
have
an
injunction
barring
removal
or
--
or
you
don't.
but
i
--
i
think
a
further
answer
to
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
(f)(2)
says,
under
this
section,
which
means
that
it
is
obviously
referring
to
court
orders
entered
in
the
course
of
--
of
removal
proceedings
under
section
1252.
and
when
--
when
a
court
finally
gets
to
the
merits
on
--
in
a
petition
for
review
in
a
court
of
appeals,
the
--
the
court,
if
it
decides
that
there's
a
flaw
--
excuse
me
--
a
legal
flaw
in
the
--
in
the
bia
or
immigration
judge's
decision,
it
vacates
the
decision
and
--
and
remands.
injunctions
are
not
necessary
in
that
--
in
that
kind
of
review.
so
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
no.
the
way
--
the
way
i
would
understand
it
to
operate
is
that
the
--
the
alien
would
have
to
make
a
clear
and
convincing
showing
that
he's
entitled
to
have
the
motion
to
reopen
granted
because
if
the
motion
to
reopen
is
granted,
that
vacates
the
final
order
of
removal
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
longer
a
final
order
of
removal
pursuant
to
which
the
alien
could
be
removed.
and
i
did
want
to
respond
to
your
suggestion
that
maybe
the
standard
should
be
more
lenient
with
respect
to
motions
to
reopen.
with
respect,
i
think
that's
the
opposite
of
what
the
rule
should
be,
if
anything,
because
the
--
the
final
--
the
review
of
the
final
order
of
removal
is
the
main
show,
and
in
that
--
in
that
situation,
the
alien
is
actually
challenging
the
order
of
removal.
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
order
of
removal
was
a
long
time
ago,
and
the
--
and
the
--
the
alien
sought
judicial
review
of
that
and
that
was
denied,
the
only
thing
before
the
court
is
the
--
is
the
motion
to
reopen.
and
staying
--
a
judicial
order
staying
the
denial
of
a
motion
to
reopen
is
meaningless.
in
order
to
get
the
relief
preventing
removal,
you
need
a
stay
of
removal,
which
--
which
really
effectively
directs
dhs,
as
we
think
it
does
in
all
cases
--
directs
dhs
not
to
execute
the
order
of
removal
that
was
--
that
was
already
previously
entered.
and
also,
the
denial
of
a
motion
to
reopen,
especially
one
like
the
one
at
issue
in
this
case,
where
the
question
is
whether
the
alien
has
shown
--
has
produced
material
evidence
of
changed
circumstances
--
that's
reviewed,
as
this
court
said
in
its
decision
in
abudu,
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
so
it
would
be
very
likely
--
very
unlikely
that
an
alien
would
prevail.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
we
--
we
believe
it
would.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
for
--
for
purposes
of
granting
a
stay,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
you
--
you
--
the
court
granted
a
stay
in
connection
with
the
--
with
the
granting
of
--
of
certiorari
in
the
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
--
yes.
well,
he
--
he
did
seek
it.
the
first
time
around,
he
sought
a
remand
for
consideration
of
his
adjustment
of
status
application,
but
one
of
the
requirements
to
be
eligible
for
that
is
that
a
visa
be
available,
and
a
visa
was
not
then
available.
and
nothing
in
the
act
requires
that
deportation
proceedings
be
held
up
until
a
visa
--
a
visa
becomes
available.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
--
but
congress
was
quite
explicit.
it
wanted
only
one
--
one
motion
to
reopen,
except
in
the
case
of
asylum
or
withholding
of
deportation.
it
wanted
--
it
wanted
the
proceedings
to
come
to
an
end.
and
that's
--
the
circumstances
of
this
case
really
powerfully
reinforce
what
congress
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
could
--
he
could
apply
for
an
immigrant
visa
from
abroad.
now,
there
may
be
situations
in
which
--
in
which
by
virtue
of
having
been
removed,
there
is
a
bar
to
his
getting
that,
but
that
is
subject
to
waiver.
so
really
what
the
alien
--
adjustment
status
in
the
united
states
is
discretionary
if
there's
a
visa
available.
it's
discretionary
from
abroad.
it's
really,
in
this
sense,
a
venue
provision
where
the
alien
applies
from
abroad.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
analogous
to
what
i
was
saying
before,
that
the
--
this
court,
like
a
court
of
appeals,
has
the
authority
to
--
to
freeze
the
status
quo
while
it
can
decide
the
--
the
pertinent
legal
issue,
and
the
pertinent
legal
issue
before
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
as
--
as
i
explained,
we
do
not
--
we
do
not
challenge
the
ability
of
--
of
a
court
to
decide
to
freeze
the
status
quo
while
it
is
ruling
on
the
motion
for
a
stay.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
there
--
but
there's
--
it's
not
two
stages;
it's
three.
the
--
a
stay
of
removal
is,
under
the
hobbs
act
terms,
an
interlocutory
injunction.
that
can
--
judicial
review
in
the
ninth
circuit
can
last
4
years.
so
if
a
stay
is
granted,
you
could
have
an
interlocutory
injunction
in
place
for
a
long
time.
the
temporary
stay
is
just
while
the
court
is
ruling,
considering
the
interlocutory
injunction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
feels
like
it,
yes.
