how
long
is
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
many
years
ago
was
the
automatic
stay
eliminated?
when
did
this
--
this
--
the
current
law
come
into
effect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
would
that
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
say
equities,
is
the
fact
that
he
has
applied
or
his
wife
has
applied
for
adjustment
of
his
status
--
is
that
an
equity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
changing
conditions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
alleged
changing
conditions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
case
--
this
case
could
come
out
the
same.
if
we
remand
and
we
say
that
it's
the
traditional
standard,
this
case
might
well
come
out
the
same
way.
the
--
the
court
might
say,
well,
it
doesn't
make
it
under
the
traditional
--
it
hasn't
shown
a
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
standard
is
probable
success
on
the
merits,
and
that's
not
an
easy
standard.
irreparable
harm
and
probable
success
on
the
merits,
both.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
would
expect
the
standard
to
be
in
the
(b)(3)(b)
provision.
it
says
that
no
automatic
stay
unless
the
court
otherwise
orders.
period.
that's
the
end
of
it.
so
if
one
just
read
this,
one
would
think
that
the
normal
standard
for
a
stay
would
apply.
and
then
(f)(2)
is
separated
by
several
pages
and
(f)(1)
is
dealing
with
something
where
we
understand
it.
it
says
no
mass
injunctions
against
the
enforcement
of
a
provision.
but
(2)
is
really
puzzling
what
it
relates
to.
if
it's
supposed
to
have
some
relationship
to
(1),
(1)
says
you
can't
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
a
provision
of
the
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
just
a
technical
point?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of
the
--
the
motion
to
reopen
was
based
on
changed
circumstances
in
cameroon.
but
there
was
also
this
independent
application
for
adjustment
of
his
status,
which
was
turned
down
because
this
was
a
successive
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
understand
it,
the
status
adjustment
could
not
have
been
asked
for
earlier
because
his
wife
didn't
come
become
a
citizen
until
after.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
now
--
now
he
would
qualify,
except
that
it's
a
successive
motion.
so
it
seems
earlier
he
was
premature
and
now
he's
too
late.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
just
ask
a
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
person
is
married
to
a
citizen,
has
an
american-citizen
child.
is
there
any
way
that
his
status
could
be
adjusted?
it
can't
in
this
procedural
situation
because
it's
a
successive
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
--
but
the
standard
that
you
say
should
apply
under
(b)(3)(b)
is
a
standard
that
is
described
as
applicable
to
temporary
injunctions.
the
word
--
there
is
substantial
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits
and
irreparable
harm
--
that
that's
--
that's
the
standard
preliminary
injunction,
not
preliminary
stay.
the
preliminary
injunction
standard.
so
the
two
words
certainly
overlap.
