what
--
what
--
what's
been
the
underlying
rationale
for
the
rule
of
lenity,
which
is
a
rule
i
think
we
should
apply
with
great
caution?
but
if
we
think
--
what's
the
reason
for
the
rule
of
lenity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
fair
notice.
it
--
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
were
counsel
practicing
criminal
law
in
the
private
sector,
and
i
negotiated
a
plea
for
simple
assault,
but
there
was
a
spouse
that
was
involved,
and
then
i
walked
down
the
courthouse
step
with
my
clients,
said
we
got
a
good
deal,
and
incidentally,
all
guns
in
your
house
must
immediately
be
surrendered
to
other
people,
you
must
take
them
all
out,
you
may
never
hunt,
you
may
never
possess
a
gun.
and
under
your
view,
if
i
don't
say
that
i'm
guilty
of,
it
seems
to
me,
serious
malpractice.
i
just
don't
see
that
there
is
notice
to
the
legal
profession.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
rule--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no.
where
the
context
is,
we
are
asking
why
the
rule
of
lenity
and
the
rule
of
lenity
is
to
ensure
notice.
and
it
seems
to
me
this
is
a
classic
case
where
there
has
to
be
notice.
you
could
come
back
and
say
that
even
if
the
statute
had
been
written
as
to
apply
specifically
to
domestic
crimes,
a
lot
of
attorneys
wouldn't
have
had
notice
on
it
when
it
was
an
omnibus
budget
bill
added
at
the
last
minute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
--
the
statute
uses
the
word
element
in
the
term
singular.
it
seems
to
me
that
although
this
statute
is
a
mess
anyway
----
[laughter]
--that
that
--
that
that
doesn't
particularly
help
you.
elements
usually
refer
to
each
component
of
the
actus
reus
--
you
entered
a
dwelling
with
a
weapon.
you
would
say
"elements"
for
that,
wouldn't
you?
and
it
seems
to
me
under
your
interpretation
the
statute
should
say
"elements".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean
when
we
are
gasping
for
straws
i'm
not
sure
anything
is
insignificant.
