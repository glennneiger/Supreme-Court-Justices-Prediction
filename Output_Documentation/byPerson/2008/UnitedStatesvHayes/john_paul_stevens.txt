justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask,
to
make
sure
i
understand
the
alternate
reading.
is
it
your
view
that
the
statute
does
mean
the
same
as
if,
after
the
words
(iii),
closed
paren,
"is
committed
by"?
if
--
now
there
is
the
element
of
"attempted
use
of
force"
is
one,
is
the
second
requirement;
and
the
third
requirement
is
that
it
be
committed
by
a
current
or
former
spouse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
--
your
reading
--
i'm
just
following
up
on
the
chief
justice's
question
--
requires
us
to
assume
that
congress
really
intended
there
to
be
a
triple
"i"
as
well
as
a
double
"i",
and
the
triple
"i"
would
have
begun
with
the
verb
"is".
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
if
you
did
do
it
that
way,
it
would
have
been
a
lot
clearer
than
it
is
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
while
we
pause,
can
i
just
ask
you
one
question
to
make
sure
i
understand
the
two
--
two
different
positions?
your
view
of
the
subsection
ii
is
that
the
meaning
you
attributed
to
it
is
--
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
you
left
out
the
word
"committed"?
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
under
your
view
the
word
--
either
the
word
"committed"
or
the
words
"committed
by"
is
superfluous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
you
need
that
in
there
if
the
statute
means
--
if
the
element
is
the
use
of
force
by
a
family
member?
why
do
you
have
to
put
in
another
verb,
"committed"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
interested
in
changes.
i'm
just
interested
in
the
text
before
us.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
reading
of
the
statute
is
exactly
what
the
statute
would
say
if
it
did
not
include
the
word
"committed".
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
the
legislative
history
correctly
in
a
broad
sense.
the
text
of
the
bill
as
originally
introduced
in
the
senate
favors
the
government.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
was
a
change
made
in
the
house
in
the
form
of
an
amendment
to
that
bill?
or
was
it
a
separate
bill
introduced
in
the
house?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
enacted
a
different
text.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--,
they
did.
and
then
--
without
explanation.
and
then
the
bill
went
back
to
the
senate.
as
i
understand
it,
it
was
approved
in
the
form
enacted
by
the
house
without
--
with
only
that
one
comment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
be
sure.
but
under
your
view,
it
actually
made
it
narrower?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
