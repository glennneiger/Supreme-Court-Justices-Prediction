ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent's
conviction
for
battering
his
wife
is
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence
primarily
for
two
reasons:
first,
the
statutory
text
is
most
naturally
read
that
way.
second,
a
contrary
reading
would
defeat
congress's
purposes.
nine
courts
of
appeals
have
determined
that
the
text
does
not
require
a
domestic
relationship
to
be
an
element
to
the
predicate
offense.
that's
because
the
statute's
text
uses
only
one
element,
using
the
singular
word
"element",
which
relates
to
mode
of
aggression.
it
then
introduces
a
new
concept
related
to
domestic
relationship,
using
a
comma
and
the
word
"committed".
the
word
"committed"
naturally
modifies
the
word
"offense".
in
common
usage,
a
person
commits
an
offense;
he
doesn't
commit
a
use
or
attempted
use
of
physical
force.
under
respondent's
reading
of
the
statute,
when
it
was
enacted
it
would
have
become
immediately
a
dead
letter
in
two-thirds
of
the
states,
and
it
wouldn't
have
any
application
to
the
federal
government.
and--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--but
congress
did
act
this
statute,
and
this
court
presumes
two
things:
first--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--there
was
a
compromise
made,
but
it
wasn't
with
respect
to
whether
there
needed
to
be
a
domestic
relationship
element.
it
was
with
respect
to
how
violent
the
offense
had
to
be.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
if
you
look
at
the
statute's
drafting
history,
there
were
two
versions
considered.
one
used
the
term
"crime
of
violence"
to
discuss
how
violent
the
statute
had
to
be,
and
then
the
second
substituted
in
the
new
language:
"has
as
an
element
the
use
or
attempted
use
of
physical
force
or
threatened
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
"
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
the--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--both
the
original
structure
and
the
statute
as
enacted
had
the
same
structure
in
that
they
had
a
"committed
by"
clause
that
modified
the
word
"offense".
now,
it's
true
that
the
use
--
(i)
and
the
romanette
(ii),
but
that
all
came
in
because
there
was
a
discussion
about
how
violent
the
offense
had
to
be,
both
--
in
the
original
statute
that
was
considered,
you
have
an
offense
committed
by
a
certain
person,
an
offense
of
a
certain
type
committed
by
a
certain
person,
and
in
the
statute
that
was
enacted
you
have
an
offense
of
a
certain
type
committed
by
a
certain
person.
now,
congress
put
more
detail
in,
in
terms
of
what
that
certain
type
of
offense
is.
this
has
as
an
"element"
language,
but
it
just
didn't
go
to
domestic
relationship.
and
to
get
back
to
one
of
the
earlier
points
in
your
question,
you
know,
this
court
presumes
when
congress
passes
a
statute
two
things
are
true:
first,
it
knows
the
legal
backdrop
on
which
it
enacts
the
law;
and
second,
that
it's
presumed
that
its
law
is
going
to
have
effect.
and
that
should
be
especially
true
here
where
congress
was
dealing
with
a
serious
nationwide
problem
of
domestic
violence
using
firearms.
congress--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
don't
think
that
makes
sense
for
two
reasons:
first,
because
when
congress
wants
to
do
that,
it
uses
its
spending
power
to
give
the
states
incentives
to
do
things
like
that,
and
it
did
that
in
the
vawa
enactment
in
1994
and
in
vawa
re-authorization
in
2005.
and,
second,
because
if
you
believe
what
respondents
suggest,
you
would
have
to
think
that
a
congress
that
was
very
concerned
about
the
powder
keg
situation
of
a
domestic
offender
with
a
gun
would
want
to
exempt
domestic
offenders
who
have
proven
that
they
are
willing
to
hurt
family
members
in
two-thirds
of
the
states,
a
congress
that
was
presumed
--
that
was
concerned
with
the
problem
of
domestic
violence
would
enact
a
statute
that
would
apply
so
infrequently,
to
at
most
these
17
states,
and
wouldn't
apply
at
all
to
federal
offenses,
making
that
"misdemeanor
under
federal
law"
language
superfluous.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
don't
think
that
that's
right,
with
respect,
your
honor,
because
you
have
an
offense
that
is
of
a
certain
character
committed
by
a
certain
person.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
that
the
word
"offense"
is
twice
modified.
there
is
an
offense
that
is
of
a
certain
character
and
there
is
an
offense
committed
by
a
certain--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--what
i'm
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
the
(i)
and
(ii)
up
to
the
break
with
"committed
by".
so
that
it
is
an
offense
that
is
a
misdemeanor
and
has
as
an
element
"committed
by".
you
know,
these
--
these
two
different
clauses
both
modify
(i)
and
(ii),
but
just
looking
at
that
sentence.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
oh,
little
roman
numeral.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
if
you
just
look
at
this
as
a
sentence,
you
have
"an
offense
that
is
a
misdemeanor
and
has
as
an
element
committed
by.
"
now,
that
"committed
by"
clause,
it
could
have
come
after
"offense"
or
it
could
be
in
the
place
where
it
is
now.
there
are
just
these
two
different
ways
that
offenses
qualify.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
two
responses.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
two
responses,
your
honor.
first,
the
"committed
by"
language
refers
back
to
"offense"
and
the
"that"
is
just
part
of
this
--
this
first
clause,
but
--
and
we
believe
that
the
government's
reading
is
the
most
logical
reading.
and
think
of
it
this
way:
you
know,
respondent
agrees
that
if
there
were
a
hard
return
before
the
"committed
by"
language,
that
it's
clear
--
that
it
would
be
more
clear
that
the
government's
reading
is
correct.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
with
respect,
your
honor,
we
think
this
can
be
read
as
all
one
sentence.
but
just
to
make
my
second
point,
which
is:
i
think
that
it
would
do
much
more
violence,
respondent's
reading
of
the
statute,
than
you
suggest
because
you're
talking
about
treating
the
singular
word
"element"
as
plural.
you're
talking
about
ignoring
the
comma
that
separates
the
"has
as
an
element"
section
from
the
"committed
by"
section,
and
then
you're
talking
about
taking
what
even
the
linguists
who
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
essentially
in
support
of
respondents
say
is
a
very
weird
usage
of
"committed".
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
we
think
that
you'd
say
--
you'd
have
to
say
"has
as
its
elements"
to
suggest
that
you
would
take
two
very
diverse
concepts
and
make
them
both
required
elements
of
the
underlying
offense.
there
are
two
concepts
here:
one
is
how
violent
the
offense
has
to
be,
and
then
there's
the
second
concept,
which
is
a
class
of
defendants,
and
that's
a
very
different
concept.
but
if
you
just
see
the
singular
"element",
"has
as
an
element",
and
then
you
see,
oh,
okay,
it
has
to
be
violent.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
with
respect,
your
honor,
we
think
that
because
congress
broke
these
up
into
these
two
different
clauses
--
one
that
relates
to
violence
and
then
a
separate
clause
that's
introduced
by
"committed
by"
where
"committed"
naturally
modifies
"offense"
--
that
it
was
treating
--
that
these
were
two
separate
requirements.
and
you're
right
that
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
the
problem
of
violent
domestic
offense,
and
if
it
was
doing
that
it
would
make
no
sense
at
all
for
congress
to
--
to
have
enacted
a
statute
that
would
such
extremely
limited
application.
and,
of
course,
respondent's
reading
would
make
the
"is
a
misdemeanor
under
federal
law.
"
superfluous.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
no.
the
rule
of
lenity
says
that
there
needs
to
be
a
grievous
ambiguity
after
this
court
seizes
aid
--
any
aid
which
can
be
derived
from
the
tools
of
statutory
interpretation.
so
even
though
we
think
that
the
text
here
is
most
naturally
read
in
the
government's
way,
every
other
indicia
of
meaning
here
points
in
favor
of
the
government's
interpretation.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
one
of
the
--
the
main
concerns
is
providing
fair
notice
of
what's
illegal.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well
certainly,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
statutory
text
is
clear,
and
that's
because
people
are
presumed
to
know
the
law.
certainly
a
person
who
has
beaten
his
wife
knows
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--the
assault
he
was
convicted
of
is
one
against
his
wife.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
your
honor,
it
was
at
the
time
that
this
statute
was
enacted
the
case
that
very
few
states
had
statutes
with
a
domestic
relationship
requirement,
only
17.
and
to
be
clear,
in
those
17
states
those
all
covered
more
domestic
relationships
than
the
federal
statute.
they
covered
things
like
dating
relationships,
violence
involving
grandparents,
etcetera.
so
that
even
from
the
face
of
your
state
conviction,
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
just
match
it
right
up
with
this
federal
offense.
and
the
fact
that
those
17
states
--
a,
that
there
was
such
a
small
number;
and
b,
that
those
states
cover
a
different
range
of
domestic
offenses--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
it
was
a
range
of
states.
i
don't
think
i
could
say
it
was
all
the
most
populous
or
all
the
least
populous
states.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
you
know,
i'd
have
to
look
at
the
list.
i
think
that
california
came
in
later
--
no,
california
did
have
one
statute;
new
york
did
not.
but
you
know,
one
thing
that's
worth
noticing
in
this
case
is
that
you
know,
the
senator,
senator
lautenberg,
who
was
the
sponsor
of
this
legislation,
was
from
new
jersey;
and
other
respondent's
reading
of
this
statute
it
wouldn't
have
even
applied
to
offenses
committed
in
new
jersey.
and
that
seems
like
an
odd
thing
to
believe.
and
of
course,
it
wouldn't
have
applied
to
federal
offenses
despite
the--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes.
i
think--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
that
that's
one
way
of
doing
it,
but
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
do
that,
because
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
this
sentence--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--there
are
ways
that
congress
could
have
made
its
manifest
intent
even
more
clear.
it
could
have
added
that
romanette
(iii);
it
could
put
a
hard
return
before
"committed
by".
but
if
you
look
at
the
effect
that
the
statute
would
have,
if
you
read
it
respondent's
way,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
reasonably
expect
that
congress
--
a
congress
that
wanted
to
get
at
the
serious
nationwide
problem
of
domestic
violence
using
firearms,
would
have
wanted
to
enact
a
statute
that
would
have
such
limited
effect.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
there
were
five
firearms.
there
was
one
found
in
his
home,
three
that
he
transferred
and
one
that
he
sold.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
we
would
hope
that
he
wouldn't
in
this
situation.
but--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--because
he
has
been
convicted
of
a
serious
violent
offense,
and
i
think
that's--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
that
a
person
who
has
been
committed
of
a
violent
offense
should
be
on
notice
that
their
procession
of
firearms--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
when--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
understand
that
concern.
we
are
not
talking
about
mere
misdemeanors
here.
we
are
talking
about
a
specific
category
of
violent
misdemeanors,
section
929(g)(9);
specifically--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--two
thoughts
on
that,
your
honor.
the
first
is,
you
know,
at
the
time
that
this
statute
was
enacted
almost
all
of
the
states
except
for
this
small
number
prosecuted
offenses
that
were
domestic
disturbance
offenses
like
the
one
in
this
case
under
general
assault
and
battery
statutes,
and
even
the
17
states
that
have
those
with
the
domestic
relations,
offenses
with
the
domestic
relationship
requirement,
still
prosecute
them
routinely
as
assault
and
battery
under
those
general
statutes.
so
i
think
a
person
--
a,
an
attorney
who
handles
those
kind
of
cases
would
have
knowledge
of
that
law;
and
b,
a
person
who
has
committed
a
serious
violent
offense
like
respondent's
previous
offense
in
this
case
should
be
on
notice
that
his
possession
of
firearms
might
be
regulated.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes,
that's
right.
i
mean,
i
really--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
i
mean,
certainly
the
offense
is
this
particular
case
was
serious.
the
charging
document
reflects
that
respondent
hit
his
wife
all
around
the
face
until
it
swelled
out,
kicked
her
all
around
her
body,
kicked
here
in
the
ribs--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
ginsburg.
all
of
the
discussion
of
this
in
congress
said
we
need
to
have
a
zero
tolerance
towards
people
--
zero
tolerance
policy
towards
people
who
are
--
have
proven
that
they
are
willing
to
commit
violent
acts
against
family
members;
and
we
already
have
a
statute
that
prohibits
felons
from
possessing
firearms,
but
we
know
that
sometimes
these
domestic
offenses
get
charged
as
misdemeanors.
and
senator
lautenberg
specifically
said
in
the
legislative
record
they
are
often
charged
as
offenses
like
assault
and
battery,
and
we
need
to
get
at
these
offenses
because
these
people
should
not
have
firearms.
they
should
not
put
their
families
in
that
type
of
powder
keg
situation,
and
they
--
we
should
not
be
putting
police
in
that
type
of
situation,
where
police
who
respond
to
a
domestic
disturbance
call
like
the
911
call
in
this
case
are
put
in
a
dangerous
situation
with
a
person
--
an
emotionally
charged
situation
--
who
would
have
a
firearm.
one
other
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
with
respect
to
your
question,
justice
scalia
--
and
this
is
not
with
respect
to
how
this
case
should
be
resolved,
but
just
as
a
practical
matter
--
that
the
vawa
2005
amendments
do
require
states,
for
a
condition
of
their
grant
funding,
to
have
a
judicial
policy
that
gives
notice
for
offenses
like
assault
and
battery
that
a
person
would
not
be
able
to
possess
a
firearm.
and
the
reason
that
they
are
doing
that
is
not
because,
you
know,
as
a
constitutional
matter
we
think
that
they
need
to,
but
because
they
really
--
congress
just
really
wants
to
keep
firearms
away
from
people
who
have
shown
that
they
are
willing
to
hurt
family
members
in
this
way.
now,
i
talked
a
little
bit
in
the
beginning
of
argument
about
how
really
every
--
every
indicia
of
meaning
in
this
case
--
and
we
do
look
to
--
to
each
of
those
different
interpretive
tools
before
we
would
invoke
the
rule
of
lenity
--
points
in
favor
of
the
government's
construction.
first
of
all,
you've
got
the
text,
and
i
think
we've
--
we've
covered
those
arguments.
but
just
as
a
practical
matter,
this
statute
would
have
an
extremely
limited
effect
if
it
didn't
--
if
it
were
interpreted
as
respondent
suggests.
the
language
with
respect
to
federal
misdemeanors
would
be
superfluous
because
the
way
that
federal
offenses
like
domestic
assaults
on
army
bases
are
charged
is
under
a
general
federal
assault
statute.
there
isn't
one
that's
specific
to
domestic
violence.
so
congress
would
have
put
this
"misdemeanor
under
federal
law"
language
in
there,
and
it
--
it
would
have
immediately
had
no
effect
either.
you
know,
the--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--there
is
--
there
is
a
general
federal
assault
statute.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
but
it
doesn't
have
a
domestic
relationship
requirement,
and
that's
the
problem.
you
know,
we
also
look
to
the
drafting
history
just
a
bit,
and
i
--
i
think
that,
you
know,
every
indicia
--
every
indication
in
the
drafting
history,
both
if
you
compare
the
first
version
of
the
bill
with
the
statute
that
was
enacted
and
the
discussion
relating
to
it,
shows
that
this
language
"has
as
an
element",
which
really
only
intended
to
get
at
how
violent
an
offense
had
to
be,
it
--
it
was
never
intended
to
get
at
any
kind
of
domestic
relationship
requirement.
and,
of
course,
the
--
the
sponsor--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that's
exactly
right,
justice--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--of
course
not,
justice
scalia.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
we
look
to
the
text
first,
but
we
also
look
to
other
indicia
--
many
of
us
also
look
to
other
indicia
of
congress's
intent.
and
some
of
those
indicia
include
things
like
a
comparison
of
the
drafting
history
and
senator
lautenberg's
statement,
which
is
directly
on
point
here,
which
says
that
offenses
like
assault
and
battery
would
be
covered.
this
is
a
--
a
powerful
tool.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
this
court
has
in
--
in
multiple
cases
looked
to
the
fact
that
the
statute,
for
example,
would
have
such
a
narrow,
limited
purpose,
in
addition
to
the
statute's
text,
to
say,
you
know,
we
can't
believe
congress
would
expect
that
purpose--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
it
was
well
known
at
the
time
that
these
offenses,
even
in
the
17
states
that
had
the
domestic
relationship
element,
were
commonly
prosecuted
as
assault
and
battery
offenses.
and
this
court
has
--
for
example,
let's
consider
the
taylor
case,
where
this
court
was
considering
the
example
of
burglary
and
trying
to
define:
should
we
pick
this
narrow,
common-law
definition
of
"burglary",
or
a
more
expansive
definition
of
"burglary"?
and,
aside
from
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
there
is
a
separate
section
of
the
court's
opinion
where
you
said:
look,
if
we
took
this
narrow,
common
law
definition
of
"burglary",
it
would
apply
basically
nowhere
and
we
just
can't
think
that
congress
intended
that.
and
you
didn't
go
right
to
the
rule
of
lenity
there.
you
looked
at,
for
example,
how
that
frustration
of
congressional
purpose
would
occur
and
the
problem
that
that
would
cause.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
thank
you.
in
this
case,
the
court
has
a
choice
between
either
reading
the
statute
in
a
way
that
uses
the
words
very
unnaturally
and
unusually
--
"committed
by"
to
modify
"use"
and
"element"
--
treating
a
singular
as
plural,
and
the
word
"committed"--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right,
and
this
court
has
said
that
you
do
that
only
when
two
things
are
true:
when
it
makes
sense
in
context,
and
we
think
it
doesn't
because
of
the
word
"committed",
which
respondent
wants
to
read
right
out
of
the
statute,
and
also
because
you
do
it
when
it's
necessary
to
fulfill
the
evident
purposes
of
the
statute.
and
here,
for
the
reasons
we
explained,
treating
the
singular
as
plural
would
be
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
the--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--it's
because
the
element
--
the
singular
"element"
has
other
indicia
meaning
it
involves
the
word
"committed"
and
then
also
this
--
the
fact
that
congress's
objective
would
be
stymied
if
you
took
respondent's
reading.
so
you've
got
a
choice
between
just
using
the
words
unnaturally
--
"committed
by",
taking
"committed"
and
just
making
it
superfluous,
as
in
respondent's
view,
or
treating
the
singular
"element"
as
plural,
or
you
can
give,
as
the
government
is
suggesting,
a
natural
and
logical
reading
that
you're
talking
about
an
offense
of
this
certain
violent
character
committed
by
these
certain
people.
and,
yes,
that
involves
looking
slightly
past
romanette
(i)
and
(ii)
structure
to
look
at
this
being
two
clauses
that
both
modify
the
word
"offense".
you--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
we
don't
agree
with
that,
and
i'll
give
you
two
illustrations
that
hopefully
would
help
establish
that
point:
one,
if
you
just
read
this
all
as
a
sentence
without
respect
to
the
romanettes
(i)
and
(ii),
you
have
an
offense
that
is
as
a
misdemeanor
and
has,
as
an
element,
committed
by
a
certain
group
of
persons.
that
reads
as
a
sentence.
there
is
an
offense
of
a
certain
type
committed
by
a
certain
group
of
persons.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
it
would
read
better
that
way.
i
think
that
it
would--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--it
would
read--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--again,
i
think
if
you
just
--
i
don't
think
you
need
to
do
that.
i
think
you
can
just
read
through
this
all
as
one
sentence.
and
we
looked
at
that
previous
--
while
were
you
talking
with
respondent's
counsel,
you
looked
at
that
previous
version
of
the
bill
congress
considered,
and
it
just
had
it
all
as
one
sentence.
it
said
"an
offense
of
this
certain
character
committed
by
this
certain
group
of
persons.
"
and
that
same
structure
is
in
the
statute
as
enacted,
and
that
shows
that
the
"committed
by"
refers
back
to
"offense".
and
to
get
back
to
the
point
i
opened
with,
the
way
that
you
choose
between
the
two
constructions
in
this
case
is
to
look
at
what
congress
would
achieve
under
respondent's
construction
of
the
statute,
which
is
a
statute
that
applies
only
in
17
states,
not--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--no,
but
it
wouldn't
be
consistent
with
what
congress
was
intending,
which
is
to
solve
the
nationwide
problem
that
every
person
who
proved
that
they
were
willing
to
hurt
their
family
members
should
not
be
able
to
possess
a
firearm,
whether
they're
a
felon
or
whether
they
were
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor.
and
that
was
the
problem
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right,
but
some
persons
in
those
states
who
commit
the
same
types
of
offenses,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out
--
you
know,
they
commit
the
same
violent
acts
against
family
members.
some
of
them
would
be
prosecuted
under
the
regular
--
under
a
specific
domestic
violence
statute,
but
some
would
be
prosecuted
under
regular
assault
and
battery
statutes.
and
it
doesn't
make
any
sense,
in
those
same
states,
to
treat
some
people
as
being
subject
to
the
possession
ban
and
some
people
as
not
being
subject
to
that
possession
ban.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
you
can't
just
tell
from
the
face
of
the
state
indictment
whether
you
would
not
be
able
to
possess
a
firearm
under
federal
law,
because
the
domestic
relationship
covered
by
the
state
offenses,
it
is
a
broader
universe
in
each
of
those
17
states.
more
domestic
relationships
are
covered
than
are
covered
by
the
federal
statute.
so
you
could
have
been
convicted
in
one
of
those
17
states
of
a
specific
domestic
violence
offense,
and
still
that
would
not
necessarily
be
the
case
that
you
couldn't
possess
a
firearm
under
federal
law,
because
they
cover,
for
example,
dating
relationships.
i
understand
that
the
notice
concerns
you've
raised
but
just
to
get
back
to
one
other
point
that
came
up
with
respondent's
counsel,
when
a
person
wants
to
buy
a
firearm,
he
fills
out
this
particular
form,
form
4473,
and
that
form
specifically
says
on
that
offenses
like
assault
and
battery
are
covered.
the
atf
regulation
that
has
been
in
place
since
this
statute
was
enacted
says
that
those
--
that
offenses
such
as
assault
and
battery
are
covered.
in
fact,
all
the
courts
of
appeals
up
until
recently,
nine
of
them
had
this
settled
understanding.
aside
from
the
atf
having
it,
congress
relied
upon
it.
and
we
think
that
it
makes
sense.
you
should
reverse
the
judgment
below.
