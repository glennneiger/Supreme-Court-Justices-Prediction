other
than
a
desire
to
weaken
this
bill
as
much
as
possible,
can
you
think
of
any
reason
why
congress
would
have
drawn
the
distinction
that
you're
drawing
between
states
that
have
specific
statutes
relating
to
domestic
violence
misdemeanor
statutes
and
those
that
don't?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
really
think
there
is
a
notice
problem
here?
if
you
had
been
advising
mr.
hayes
after
he
was
convicted
of
this
misdemeanor,
and
you
read
this,
would
you
say
well,
you
know,
you're
--
it's
a
good
thing
that
you
were
convicted
of
this
in
west
virginia,
where
there
isn't
a
specific
statute
targeting
domestic
violence,
because
it
doesn't
cover
you.
if
you
had
been
convicted
in
another
state
under
a
specific
domestic
violence
statute
then
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
possess
firearms
but
you're
home
free
because
of
the
nature
of
the
statute
in
your
state?
