chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-608,
united
states
v.
hayes.
ms.
saharsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
understand
your
objection
to
the
reading
that
your
friend
would
have
us
adopt,
but
you
have
the
same
sort
of
problem.
i
mean,
you've
got
a
--
if
it
reads
the
way
you
would
have
it,
then
the
word
"that"
after
"an
offense
that"
doesn't
quite
work,
and
have
you
to
add
"is"
before
"is
committed",
if
you're
going
to
keep
the
"that".
so
it
seems
to
me
that
this
doesn't
work
grammatically
either
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you've
changed
the
word.
you
read
it
as
if
it
says
"an
offense
that
committed".
so
either
the
"that"
is
out
or
you've
got
to
add
the
word
"is".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
you
use
the
word
"that"
in
the
first
example,
but
you
skip
the
word
"that"
in
the
second.
(i)
and
(ii).
in
other
words,
that
modifies
both
of
them,
and
you're
reading
it
that
it's
an
offense
committed,
and
yet
under
the
statute
it
has
to
be
an
"offense
that
committed".
so
you've
either
got
to
leave
(i).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
romanette?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i've
never
heard
that
before.
that's
--
romanette.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
--
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
following
why
"element"
is
singular.
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
i
understood,
is
that
the
element
is
the
use
of
physical
force
committed
by
a
current
or
former
spouse.
so
"element"
is
still
singular.
i
--
maybe
i'm
missing
something.
what
change
would
you
have
to
make
to
the
word
"element"
to
adopt
their
reading?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
thought
the
whole
point
of
this
was
to
get
at
violence
committed
by
a
family
member,
and
if
that's
the
critical
element,
you
don't
have
to
have
two
different
elements,
"violence"
and
then
"committed".
it's
violence
committed
by
a
family
member.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
we
think
that
there
are
two
awkward
readings,
yours
and
your
friend's,
and
both
of
them
require
surgery,
don't
we
resolve
that
under
the
rule
of
lenity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
was
a
small,
a
small
number.
were
they
populous
states?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
california,
new
york?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
seems
there
is
no
federal
misdemeanor
that
covers
this
particular
type
of
assault,
in
other
words?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
does
that
relate
to
the
rule
of
lenity?
i
suppose,
to
get
back
to
justice
kennedy's
point,
you're
saying
that
the
lawyer
would
not
only
be
obligated
to
read
this,
but
in
advising
his
client
would
be
obligated
to
go
back
and
read
the
drafting
history
and
the
legislative
history.
do
we
really
use
those
types
of
materials
to
trump
the
--
the
rule
of
lenity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
lawyer
advising
his
client
in
the
typical
assault
case
is
supposed
to
know
at
the
time
that
only
17
states
had
this
type
of
provision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
giatras.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
agree
with
justice
stevens.
read
it
without
the
word
"committed".
it
not
only
has
the
same
effect,
but
it's
more
natural,
because
it's
"use
of
force
by
a
current
or
former
spouse.
"
as
opposed
to
"use
of
force
committed
by".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
drafted
the
way
it
should
have
been
if
your
friends
are
correct.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
is
that
the
right
list?
that's
--
that's
statutes
passed
after
1996.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
looked
at
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
national
network,
page
18
footnote
53,
and
i
see
california,
illinois,
michigan,
ohio.
which
is
the
right
list?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
saharsky,
six
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
i
could
stop
you
there.
the
very
first
sentence
in
the
united
states
code,
1
u.s.c.
section
1,
says
the
singular
includes
the
plural.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know,
but
basically
what
you're
saying
is
we
don't
follow
1
u.s.c.
section
1
because
our
reading
is
correct.
if
they
said,
well,
it
doesn't
--
you
know,
in
context
it
doesn't
fulfill
the
purposes
and
therefore
we
read
1
of
the
united
states
code.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and,
again,
not
to
beat
a
dead
horse,
but
it's
footnote
8
of
your
brief
on
page
23
that
lists
the
17
states.
they
include
california,
illinois,
michigan,
ohio,
virginia.
that
wouldn't
be
a
useless
act
by
congress
to
cover
everybody
in
those
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know,
but
you
point
was
this
doesn't
do
any
good
because
it's
only
17
states.
those
are
--
there
are
a
lot
of
people
in
those
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-608,
united
states
versus
hayes.
