justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i
read
this
old
one
--
as
i
read
the
first
one,
senator
lautenberg
put
in
the
language,
and
his
language
in
the
first
one
was
to
say
i'll
tell
you
a
group
of
people
who
shouldn't
have
guns.
the
people
who
commit
a
crime
of
domestic
violence.
now
what's
that?
in
the
statute
he
says
it
is
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
violence
committed
by
a
person
in
a
family
relation
with
the
victim.
then
he
says
after,
i
changed
that
language
a
little.
i'll
tell
you
why.
because
somebody
told
me
misdemeanor
crime
of
violence
is
too
broad.
it
could
include
cutting
up
a
credit
card.
so
i'll
define
it
more
specifically.
and
he
defines
if
more
specifically
to
say
that
it
is
a
crime
that
has
as
an
element
the
use
or
attempted
use
of
physical
force
or
threatening
people
with
a
weapon.
end
of
the
matter.
they
substitute
those
words
and
they
did
another
thing
the
drafter
as
he
breaks
out
the
thing
it
says:
it
is
a
crime
that
is
a
misdemeanor
and,
you
see,
and
that's
where
the
problem
is,
because
if
you
put
in
a
"that",
then
you
have
to
have
an
"is".
so
he
left
out
the
"is".
okay.
so
i
say
what
did
senator
lautenberg
want
with
these
words?
i
see.
how
did
he
change
it?
i
can't
find
a
word
that
supports
the
reason
that
you
have.
now,
maybe
they
are
there.
that's
what
you'll
tell
me.
and
then
i
say
it's
the
fine
language
consistent
with
what
he
wanted.
it
requires
putting
in
an
"is".
i
don't
find
that
too
awful.
that's
your
argument
against
you.
what
is
it?
your
argument
to
rebut
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
conclusion.
you're
reaching
that
conclusion.
what
i
need
from
you
is
something
that
would
tell
me,
no,
congress
didn't
just
want
to
clarify
in
the
way
lautenberg
said.
what
they
wanted
to
do
was,
in
fact,
restrict
the
scope
of
this
so
it
only
applied
in
17
states.
okay.
i'm
open
to
that
argument.
it
could
be
a
good
argument.
just
point
me
to
the
things
that
suggest
that
that
is
what
congress
wanted
to
do,
rather
than
by
what
senator
lautenberg
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i've
got
the
words.
if
the
best
you
can
do
is
point
me
to
the
words
of
the
statute,
i'll
take
that
into
account.
i'm
asking
the
question
to
see
if
there
is
anything
at
all
more?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
the
text.
i
want
something
for
my
purposes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
are
you
saying
that
senator
lautenberg
did
not
change
the
words
"misdemeanor
crime
of
violence"
to
the
words
"use
of
physical
force"
or
"threatened
use
of
deadly
weapon"?
that's
what
he
got
up
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
said
that
he
wanted
to
change.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
--
we're
in
--
the
question
specifically
is
where
did
the
words
come
from?
i
thought
that
the
words
came
from
senator
lautenberg.
the
reason
i
thought
that
is
because
he
got
up
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
said
that's
what
he
did.
now,
if
you're
telling
me
they
came
from
a
different
place,
what
is
there
in
anywhere?
i'm
open
to
hearing
it,
but
i
couldn't
find
anything
that
said
they
had
come
from
a
different
place.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
--
the
--
the
language
on
physical
force
came
from
the
house?
that's
what
you're
saying?
i'm
just
trying
to
be
clear.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
might
have.
i'm
not
criticizing.
i
want
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
making
progress.
and
you're
saying
that
in
the
house
there
were
some
people
who
didn't
want
it
to
extend
to
beyond
17
states?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
that,
you'd
have
to
assume
that
the
gs-12
who
drafted
this,
or
whoever
the
equivalent
was
in
the
senate,
put
the
"that"
in
the
wrong
place.
if
he
had
put
the
(i)
when
he
broke
it
down,
it
would
all
read
as
a
sentence.
the
"that"
would
be
for
the
first
part,
and
you'd
say
"felony
committed"
for
the
part
that
interests
us.
does
that
work?
