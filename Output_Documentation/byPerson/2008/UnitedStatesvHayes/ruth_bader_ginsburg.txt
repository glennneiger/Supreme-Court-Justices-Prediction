the
suggestion
was
that
congress
may
have
wanted
to
give
an
incentive
to
states
to
have
special
domestic
violence
statutes
instead
of
punishing
domestic
abusers
under
a
generic
battery
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
the
--
wasn't
the
statute
responding
to
just
that
problem,
that
domestic
abuse
tended
to
be
charged
as
misdemeanors
rather
than
felonies?
and
it
was
that
fact
that
the
senator
was
responding
to
when
he
included
misdemeanor.
the
whole
purpose
of
this
was
to
make
a
misdemeanor
battery
count
for
the
statute's
purpose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
it
was
that
the
use
of
force
--
to
make
it
clear
is
a
misdemeanor
--
had
to
involve
a
use
of
force,
and
that
wasn't
clear
before,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
sense
would
it
make
for
congress
to
say
take
two
abusers?
the
conduct
is
identical.
and
in
state
a
there
is
one
consequence
to
bar
on
the
possession
of
guns,
and
state
b
there
isn't
for
the
identical
conduct,
why
would
congress
want
these
two
different
results?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
suppose
this
statute,
the
one
that
was
enacted,
had
the
word
"if"
before
"committed".
would
that
then
convey
the
meaning
that
the
government
is
urging?
has
as
an
element
use
of
force,
comma,
"if"
committed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
"if
committed"
would
break
from
"use
of
force".
the
element
is
the
use
of
force,
but
then
the
crime
would
have
to
have
been
committed
by
a
current
or
former
spouse;
so
wouldn't
an
"if"
separate
what
is
the
element,
that
is,
use
of
force?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
--
counsel
advising
mr.
hayes
surely
would
have
looked
at
what
was
the
uniform
position
in
all
the
circuits.
all
the
circuits
that
had
this
question
before
the
fourth
read
it
the
way
the
government
is
urging.
so
counsel
i
think
would
have
been
highly
irresponsible
to
advise
mr.
hayes
that
he
would
be
home
free,
simply
because
his
own
state
didn't
have
a
separate
domestic
violence
statute.
justice

federal
law
has
long
prohibited
the
possession
of
firearms
by
a
convicted
felon.
in
1996,
congress
extended
this
ban
to
persons
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence.
the
definition
of
that
phrase
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
does
it
cover
a
misdemeanor
battery
whenever
the
battered
victim
was
in
fact
the
offender's
current
or
former
spouse
or
other
statutorily
defined
domestic
relation
notably
the
offender's
child?
or
is
the
gun
possession
ban
triggered
only
when
the
predicate
misdemeanor
identifies
as
an
expressed
element
of
the
crime,
a
domestic
relationship
between
the
aggressor
and
the
victim.
we
hold
that
the
domestic
relationship
while
that
must
be
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
need
not
be
a
defining
element
of
the
predicate
events.
respondent
randy
hayes
was
charged
with
three
counts
of
possessing
firearms
after
having
been
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence.
the
indictment
identified
hayes'
predicate
events
as
a
1994
conviction
for
battery
in
violation
of
west
virginia
law.
the
victim
of
that
battery
was
hayes'
then
wife.
hayes
sought
to
dismiss
the
indictment
observing
that
his
west
virginia
statute
of
conviction
was
a
generic
battery
proscription.
the
firearm
ban
he
asserted
applied
only
to
persons
convicted
of
an
offense
that
includes
a
domestic
relationship
between
the
offender
and
the
victim
as
a
defining
element.
the
district
court
rejected
hayes'
argument,
and
hayes
entered
a
conditional
guilty
plea.
on
appeal,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
agreed
with
hayes
and
reversed.
in
so
holding,
the
court
split
from
the
nine
other
courts
of
appeals
that
have
decided
the
question.
we
reverse
the
fourth
circuit's
judgment.
we
first
explain
why
the
text
and
context
of
the
governing
statute
support
our
reading.
we
next
take
account
of
practical
considerations.
felon-in-possession
laws,
congress
recognized,
were
failing
to
keep
firearms
out
of
the
hands
of
domestic
abusers
who
are
often
charged
with
misdemeanors
rather
than
felonies.
to
close
this
loophole,
congress
extended
the
federal
firearm
prohibition
to
misdemeanor
crimes
of
domestic
violence.
excluding
from
the
statutory
definition,
domestic
abusers
convicted
under
generic
battery
laws
would
frustrate
congress'
manifest
purpose.
as
of
1996,
only
about
a
third
of
the
states
had
criminal
statutes
that
specifically
proscribe
domestic
violence.
even
today,
the
number
is
only
modestly
higher.
if
the
fourth
circuit
were
right
in
its
analysis
of
the
controlling
legislation,
congress'
enactment
would
have
been
a
dead
letter
in
the
majorly
of
states
from
the
very
moment
of
its
passage.
we
decline
to
treat
the
congressional
endeavor
as
in
large
measure
ineffectual.
what
little
there
is
of
legislative
history
corroborates
our
ruling,
it
indicates
that
congress
sought
to
apply
the
firearm
ban
to
all
persons
convicted
of
domestic
violence
offenses
whether
or
not
the
statutes
of
conviction
happened
to
contain
a
domestic
relations
element.
