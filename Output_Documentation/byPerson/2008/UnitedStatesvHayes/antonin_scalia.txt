justice
antonin
scalia
well,
respondent
says
that
may
be
because
a
lot
of
people
in
congress
wanted
it
to
be
a
dead
letter.
they
would
have
wanted
the
whole
thing
to
be
a
dead
letter.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
didn't
like
this
statute
because
it
was
a
gun
control
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it's
a
compromise
with
the
people
who
wanted
no
statute
at
all
and
you
come
out
with
a
statute
that
covers
one-third
of
the
states
anyway,
i
mean
that's,
you
know
--
that's
the
deal.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
know
--
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
also
substituted
this
structure
that
we
are
--
that
we
are
discussing
today.
didn't
that
come
in
at
the
same
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
why
--
why
say
it's
only
the
former
provision
that
was
the
compromise
and
not
the
addition
of
this
later
language?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't.
i
mean,
you
have
the
(i)
and
(ii),
and
this
is
part
of
(ii).
i
think
you've
got
to
either
say
"that
committed"
or
--
or
put
in
an
"is"
--
"that
is
committed".
it
just
doesn't
parse,
and
that
lack
of
parsing
is
much
worse
than
the
one
that
you
--
you
point
to
in
the
other
side's
reading.
yes,
it's
not
usual
to
talk
about
committing
a
use
of
force,
but
it
happens
sometimes.
it's
--
it's
not
the
most
elegant
language,
but
there
are
many
examples
of
such
usage
that
have
been
brought
forth
by
the
other
side
and
by
some
of
the
amici.
so
they
have
something
that
--
it's
not
elegant,
but
people
have
spoken
that
way.
nobody
speaks
the
way
you
want
us
to
speak:
"an
offense
that
committed
by
a
person
or
an
offense
that
--
committed
by
a
current
or
former.
"
nobody
talks
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
nobody.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
agree
with
that.
you'd
still
have
the
"that"
up
above.
you
would
have
to
have
a
hard
return
and
take
out
the
(a)
is
a
misdemeanor,
"has
as
an
element"
and
then
a
hard
return,
and
you
have
to
add
"and
is
committed".
you
still
have
to
add
language
besides
the
hard
return.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
want
to
follow
up
on
justice
kennedy's
inquiry
about
the
rule
of
lenity.
don't
you
think
the
rule
of
lenity
is
particularly
important
when
you're
dealing
with
conduct
that
is
not
malum
in
se?
i
mean,
to
say
that,
well,
we
are
not
going
to
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
to
a
statute
that
posits
an
increased
sentence
for
kneecapping
or
for
some
violent
conduct,
the
person
knows
he
shouldn't
be
doing
that
stuff
anyway.
but
this
imposes
a
--
a
--
a
penalty
for
conduct
that
no
one
would
think
is
unlawful.
this
fellow
is
--
wasn't
it
his
father's
gun
he
was
taking
to
sell
at
a
gun
show
or
something?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
could
have
ten,
couldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
for
this
language
that
you
say
makes
his
owning
of
a
firearm
unlawful,
it
wouldn't
be
unlawful
at
all,
would
it?
he
would
have
no
reason
to
think
he
couldn't
have
a
firearm.
justice
antonin
scalia
should
be.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
misdemeanor
--
a
misdemeanor
offense.
and
--
and
--
and
he
should
suspect
that
because
he
committed
a
misdemeanor,
he
cannot
have
a
firearm?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
anybody
would
assume
that.
indeed,
there
are
some
who
assume
that
you
--
you
cannot
prevent
the
owning
of
a
firearm
for
a
mere
misdemeanor,
as
opposed
to
a
felony.
justice
antonin
scalia
make
it
clear.
make
it
clear,
so
that
when
--
when
his
lawyer
pleads
to
the
offense,
he
doesn't
have
to
read
in
a
little
(iii)
where
there
is
not
a
little
(iii).
and
he
--
well,
you
did
not
plead
guilty
or
you
are
not
accused
of
the
offense
of
using
violence
against
a
family
member.
you're
just
--
just
accused
of
--
of
using
violence,
a
misdemeanor.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
a
serious
violent
offense.
are
there
--
is
there
felony
assault
and
battery?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
was
misdemeanor
assault
and
battery,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
that
serious
an
offense.
that's
why
we
call
it
a
misdemeanor.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
he
should
have
been
charged
with
a
felony,
but
he
wasn't.
he
was
charged
with
a
misdemeanor.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
--
i
think
that
people
are
governed
by
the
law
that
is
passed,
not
by
the
law
that
congress
intended
to
pass.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
really,
if
a
lawyer
reading
this
would
not
think
that
it
applied,
i
don't
care
what
congress
intended.
if
--
if
the
law
doesn't
say
that,
the
person
is
not
governed
by
it.
you
think
a
person
could
be
governed
by
it
despite
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
say
that
because
congress
intended
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
you
say
that
that
was
the
compromise.
i
don't
know
that
you
have
any
evidence
to
--
to
show
that
that
was
an
intentional
--
an
intentional
alteration
made
in
the
house
of
representatives.
do
you?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
other
side
says
that
the
reason
that
was
the
case
was
that
they
objected
to
the
fact
that
--
what
was
its
language
--
the
--
the
old
version
did
not
say
a
"misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence".
it
was
--
it
was
broader.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
--
where
is
the
earlier
version?
do
we
have
the
earlier
version
anywhere--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
materials
in
front
of
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
this
structure
come
from
senator
lautenberg?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
did
it
come
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
came
out
of
the
house
version.
the
house
version
had
this
which
was
different
from
the
senate
version
that
lautenberg
was
responsible
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
language
came
from
the
house?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
senator
lautenberg
would
not
have
been
the
drafter
of
this
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
would
have?
did
it
language
come
over
to
the
senate
from
the
house
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
very
form
that
was
ultimately
enacted
was
the
form
that
came
over
from
the
house
to
the
senate?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
it
gives
greater
assurance
of
what
exactly
the
prior
conviction
was.
if
there
is
just
a
prior
conviction
of
misdemeanor
violence,
you
have
to
go
back,
i
suppose,
and
look
at
the
conviction,
look
at
the
testimony
to
find
out
whether
indeed
it
was
domestic
violence.
it
was
just
a
general
--
general
assault
statute.
you
don't
know
it
was
committed
in
the
home
or
not.
whereas
if
you're
--
if
you're
convicted
of
the
crime,
the
misdemeanor
of
violence
against
a
spouse
or
a
relative
like
this,
you
know
exactly
what
the
--
what
the
crime
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that
--
that
when
someone
purchases
a
firearm,
they
have
to
affirm,
check
a
box,
i
have
been
convicted
of
a
crime
of
domestic
violence.
is
that
how
it
reads?
and
that
goes
to,
you
know,
to
the
federal
government
and
they
check
the
records
of
convictions.
how
--
how
would
your
client
check
that?
i
have
been
--
i
have
been
convicted
of
a
crime
of
domestic
violence,
if
he
had
been
convicted
of
assault
and
the
assault
happened
to
be
domestic
assault
would
--
would
he
be
perjuring
himself
if
he
said
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
--
does
it
make
clear
whether
the
offense
has
to
be
domestic
--
a
domestic
violence
offense
or
whether
an
ordinary
assault
offense
will
qualify
if
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
domestic?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you've
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
and
it's
drafted
the
way
the
statute
should
have
been
drafted.
isn't
that
interesting.
in
other
words,
it
breaks
out
the
"was
committed
by
a
current
or
former
spouse.
"
and
makes
that
a
separate
provision,
rather
than
a
part
of
the
element
"use
of
attempted
force
against
a
family
member.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
sure
it
would.
just
as
an
"is"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
if
you
want
to
add
words
you
can
add
"if",
you
can
add
"as
is",
you
could
rewrite
the
statute
a
lot
of
ways.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
under
anybody's
view,
it
made
it
narrow.
under
lautenberg's
view,
it
made
it
narrow.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
did
it
make
it
broader?
i
mean,
it
used
to
cover
cutting
--
cutting
a
credit
card.
now,
it
no
longer
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
it
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
add
words.
it
is
unavoidable.
to
come
to
your
reading,
you
must
add
words
to
the
statute.
to
adopt
the
reading
of
the
other
side
on
the
other
hand,
you
need
not
add
a
single
word.
you
just
have
to
resign
yourself
to
the
--
to
the
usage
that
is
unusual
but
not
unheard
of,
that
a
particular
use
was
committed.
and
the
other
side
gives
a
number
of
examples,
as
does
the
brief
by
--
by
linguists,
a
number
of
examples
where
that
appears.
so
it's
an
unusual
usage
but
not
an
unheard
of
usage.
they
don't
have
to
add
a
single
word
or
a
single
hard
break
in
the
text.
you
have
to,
to
get
to
your
construction.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
would
have
to
put
a
"that"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you'd
have
to
put
a
(ii)
as
well,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
makes
it
easier
to
identify
it.
you
don't
have
to
go
back
and
look
to
see
whether
this
particular
assault
conviction
was
an
assault
on
a
family
member
or
not.
it's
there
on
the
face
of
the
indictment.
pretty
important,
it
seems
to
me.
