mr.
troy
n.
giatras
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fundamental
flaw
in
the
government's
argument
is
that
it
describes
a
statute
that
congress
considered
but
did
not
pass.
in
the
statute's
final
version
congress
defined
the
"misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence"
to
require
that
the
predicate
offense
have
as
an
element
a
domestic
relationship
between
the
offender
and
the
victim.
and
the
government's
reading
ignores
the
legislative
compromise
that
led
to
the
contested
language;
and,
if
adopted
by
this
court,
would
rewrite
the
statute
and
hand
one
side
the
legislative
victory
that
they
were
unable
to
achieve
in
congress.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
there
is
nothing
that
speaks
to
the
words
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
congressional
record,
your
honor,
but
their
inaction
and
the
lack
of
words
speak
very
loudly.
and
it
was
--
from
march
of
1996,
when
the
legislation
was
introduced,
and
then
it
went
over
to
the
house
after
passing
significantly
in
the
senate,
it
was
stalled,
and
it
was
stymied,
and
it
did
not
move.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
had
to
at
one
time
be
taken
from
a
--
and
put
into
the
stalking
bill
and
then
removed
from
the
stalking
bill
and
replaced
back
in
then
to
a
postal
bill,
which
was
then
modified
into
the
appropriations
bill.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
it
certainly
was
broader,
but
there
was
nothing
--
and
there
was
no
one
that
spoke
in
the
house
of
representatives
on
that
matter.
and
there
was
only
one
--
the
principal
author
of
the
legislation,
the
sponsor,
spoke
in
the
senate.
and
it
was
not
until
the
eleventh
hour
on
september
28th
of
1996
that
this
entire
change
was
made.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
the--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--yes.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
appendix
b,
page
5a
of
the
red
brief
--
i'm
sorry.
it's
page
4a
of
the
red
brief.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
i
apologize.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
no.
that
is
part
of
the
element
--
the
one
element
that
is
required.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
well,
because
that's
who
--
that's
who
it
would
--
that's
who
it
would
address
to.
and
that
would
be
with
respect
to
--
when
you
look
at
the
definition
that's
set
forth,
it
was
to
change
from
the
original
--
original--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--i
--
i
don't
know,
justice.
i
don't
believe
so,
though.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
it
would
still
include
--
it
would
still
include
both
attributes
into
the
one
element
even
if
the
word
"committed"
were
removed
from
double
ii,
yes.
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
about
that.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
the
legislation
that
the
senator
introduced
was
not
the
legislation
that
was
passed
by
congress.
and,
justice
breyer,
it
is
very
clear
from
the
statutory
and
legislative
history
in
this
case
from
--
you
just
take
up
through
september
28th
of
1996,
that
the
sponsor
of
the
legislation
decries
with
respect
to
the
staunch
opposition
that
was
in
the
house,
and
the
fact
that
his
bill
was
going
nowhere.
this
may
have
been
his
intended
purpose
with
respect
to
what
was
introduced,
but
it
was
then
the
will
of
congress
with
changing--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--by
take
--
by
taking
a
look
at
the
final
passed
legislation.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
other
than
the
fact
that
the
structure
of
the
statute
also
changed,
and
the
structure
of
the
statute
changed--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--what
we
have--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--and
what
is
problematic
here,
justice,
is
that
the
legislative
history
does
not
speak
on
this
particular
matter.
it
is
silent
on
this.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
it
is
--
it
has
to
be
presumed
that
it
came
from
--
we
don't
know
exactly
where,
but
it
came
out
of
the
house,
and
the
house
of
representatives
on
september
28th--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--no.
this
was
a
version
that
was
passed
in
the
senate
as
the
"as
introduced"
language.
it
then
went
and
it
was
sat
--
it
sat
in
the
house
of
representatives
for
a
long
period
of
time.
it
was
not
until
september
28th,
prior
--
right
prior
to
the
time
that
the
budget
bill
had
to
have
been
sent
back
to
--
to
the
senate
to
be
voted
on
and
then
proved
by
the
president
to
continue
the
government
to
run.
and
this
bill
was
changed
then
in
the
house
of
representatives
on
--
at
the
11th
hour--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
the
--
senator
lautenberg
does
not
disagree
that
he
came
to
an
agreement
on
this
language.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
justice,
as
this
court
has
articulated
in
allapattah,
that
sometimes
there
can
be
a
strategic
manipulation
to
secure
results.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
they
would
have
come
from
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
yes.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
threatened
use
of--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--the
use
or
attempted
use
of
physical
force
or
the
threatened
use
of
a
deadly
weapon
language,
including
the
words
"misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence"
came
over
from
the
house.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
well,
by
the
mere
fact
that
they
--
we
don't
have
them
speaking
to
it,
because
there
was
no
actual
congressional
record
of
them
speaking
to
it
or
someone
taking
to
the
floor
in
the
house
of
representatives.
it's
absolutely
silent.
we
have
to,
instead,
go
back
to
what
senator
lautenberg
was
saying
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
during
this
period
of
time,
where
he
made
very
clear
that
what
was
occurring
to
his
bill
that
it
was
dying,
that
it
was
being
killed
and
it
was
being
gutted
in
september
of
--
early
to
late
september
of
1996,
the
author
says
that
his
bill
is
being
gutted
and
it's
dying,
and
that
there
are
significant
staunch
opposition
from
certain
forces
in
order
to
limit
the
bill.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
i
don't
think
we
can
speak
why
certain
states
did
or
did
not
or
why
congress
would
only
want
there
to
be
17.
but,
certainly,
there
is
nothing
--
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
express
other
than
the
fact
that
it
was
the
effect
of
a
judicial
--
of
a
legislative
compromise.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
it
was
--
the
language
that
was
ultimately
agreed
upon
by
the
entire
congress,
your
honor,
was
as
a
result
of
a
compromise.
and
--
that--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--you
will
know
that.
certainly.
and
by
even
the
--
the
text
of
the
statute,
it
changes
from
a
crime
of
violence
to
the
definition
of
misdemeanor.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
there
are
--
there
are
cases
that
are
prosecuted
in
that
manner
where
also
lying
on
the
form
gives
charge
--
gives
rise
to
a
federal
offense.
and
the
atf
regulation
is
--
reads
the
statute
slightly
--
reads
the
statute
--
it
reads
the
statute
significantly
different
and
puts
in
parentheticals
such
as
assault
and/or
battery
and
also
puts
in
parentheticals
how
--
they
use
the
word
"was
committed"
in
a
--
in
a
third
subparagraph.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
well,
it
--
it
--
the
atf
regulation
denotes
that
you
should
even
put
it
down
if
it's
going
to
be
an
assault
and--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--the
atf
regulation
is
in
appendix
f
to
your
red
brief,
page
12
a.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
that--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--that
--
it's
drafted
the
way
--
it's
drafted
the
way
the
original
sponsor
of
the
legislation
would
have
wanted
it
to
pass
congress,
your
honor
--
or
chief
justice.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
well,
i
think
that
the
--
the
best
advice
is
to
take
that
of
judge
sentelle's
dissenting
opinion
in
barnes
where
element
or
elements
is
insignificant,
the
plural
of
it.
instead
it's
what
is
the
element
as
opposed
to
how
many
elements
there
are.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
well
--
and
in
this
particular
matter,
when
in
seeking
--
if
after
seizing
everything
from
which
the
aid
can
or
may
be
derived,
i
think
we
can
only
guess
as
to
congress's
intent.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
well,
that
may
make
it
slightly
even
more
vague,
justice,
because
then
it's
whether
or
not
it's
even
part
or
parcel
or
whether
it
is
or
isn't
part
of
it.
here
at
least
what
they--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--i
don't
believe
that
to
use
the
word
"if"
changes
our
position,
justice--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--well,
"was",
if--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--well
--
and
one
way
is
that
this
statute
denotes
that
there
is
a
part
(c),
of
which
there
is
no
part
(c).
this
statute
also
lacks
--
even
though
it's
very
insignificant
in
and
of
itself,
by
itself
--
it
lacks
a
period
at
the
very
end
of
double
i.
again,
no
one
particular
point
can
be
--
would
say
that
we
would
allow
that
punctuation
to
overcome
the
purpose,
or
overcome
the
text,
but
when
taken
as
a
whole,
when
you
have
the
text
and
an
inartfully
drafted
statute
that
references
sections
that
don't
exist,
that
has
grammatical
errors
in
it
and
that
leaves
things
up
to
the
reader
to
have
to
decide
whether
something
is
involved
or
not
involved;
and
you
also
then
have
a
lack
of
sufficient
congressional
record,
then
i
believe
that
it
certainly
is
favored
to
look
at
the
rule
of
lenity
in
this
case.
i
do
want
to
also--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--i
believe
it
would
have
been
--
in
1993,
'94
time
period,
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
--
it
would
have
been,
it
should
have
been
very
easy
to
--
to
advise
mr.
hayes
with
respect
to
that
issue.
certainly.
that
he
would
not
have
lost
his
rights
at
that
point.
thereafter
when
congress
passed
this
statute,
then
i
believe
that
--
does
it
become
a
little
murky?
it
probably
does
become
a
little
murky.
after
you
have
the
hindsight
of
being
able
to
one,
take
a
look
at
the
legislative
record
if
that's
the
necessary,
and/or
consider
that,
and/or
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
atf
regulation,
the
only
problem
is
the
atf
regulation
takes
it
--
takes
us
back
in
time
to
what
they
would
have
--
what
would
have
been
or
what
they
would
have
liked
it
to
have
been
as
opposed
to
what
was
actually
legislated--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
and
justice
ginsburg,
the
only
reason
i
say
that
in
this
particular
case,
is
because
mr.
hayes
was
in
1993
--
and
was
pled
in
1994,
which
was
prior
to
enactment
of
this
statute
and/or
any
of
the
circuit
court
opinions.
so
that
was
my
--
that
was
the
reason
for
my
answer
that
in
mr.
hayes'
case
it
would
have
been
very
simple
and
no
one
would
have
looked
to
those
issues
because
those
didn't
exist.
to
bring
to
the
--
to
answer
one
of
the
questions
from
the
chief
justice
with
respect
to
what
states
may
have
had
these
laws
in
1996,
on
page
24
of
the
government's
merits
brief,
the
footnote
number
9
denotes
--
footnote
number
9
denotes
the
states,
which
include
alabama,
kansas,
missouri,
nebraska,
maine,
north
carolina
and
the
like.
kansas,
and
mississippi.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
yes.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
and
that
is
the
right
list,
chief
justice,
and
that
includes
west
virginia
in
the
1996,
that
was
passed.
and
that
is
there
on
footnote
number
53,
just
so
it's
correct.
our
reading
of
the
statute
is
more
reasonable
than
the
government's.
certainly
with
respect
to
the
variances
of
the
grammatical
errors
and
the
grammatical
leaps
that
the
government
must
take
in
order
to
substantiate
its
reading
of
the
statute,
we
believe
that
ours
is
more
reasonable.
likewise,
the
legislative
history
in
this
particular
case
is
very
weak,
and
if
this
court
even
considers
it,
then
i
think
you
can
take
a
look
with
respect
to
the
text,
the
structure,
the
purpose
and
the
history
and
determine--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
it
was
not
a
separate
bill.
there
was
--
there
no
committee
--
there
was
no
committee
substitute,
there
was
no
committee
hearings.
it
just--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--yes--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--that
is
with
only
--
yes.
and
that
--
and
that
comment
did
not
speak
--
the
comment
of
the
sponsor
did
not
speak
with
respect
to
the
domestic
violence,
the
domestic
relationships
element.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
he
did
say
that
he
agreed
with
the
change,
and
that
he
also
said,
though,
that
the
he
--
that
the
bill,
the
new
bill
made
it
more
precise
and
broader.
which
was
a
--
which
was
a
quote
from
the
sponsor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--yes.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
respondent
asks
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the--
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
--other
than
he
said
the
words
that
it
made
it
more
precise
and
broader.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
the
text
of
the
statute
as
enacted
makes
it
more
narrow.
mr.
troy
n.
giatras
thank
you.
