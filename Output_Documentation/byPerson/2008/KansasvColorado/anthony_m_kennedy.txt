justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
1911
a
stand-alone
provision
that
would
justify
relief
for
you,
or
do
we
have
to
also
refer
to
the
general
cost
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
let's
assume
that
we
think
congress
can
control
this
--
this
issue,
this
question.
now,
i'm
asking
if
911
isn't
a
stand-alone
section
so
that
you
can
interpret
it
without
reference
to
1920.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
think
this
case
is
controlled
by
1911,
do
i
have
to
refer
to
1920?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
can't
you
rest
your
case
just
on
1911?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
1911
doesn't
cover
expert
witness
fees
because
it's
not
included
within
the
term
"other
necessary
disbursements"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
they
within
1911?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
other
necessary
disbursements.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
incidental
to
the
case.
you
don't
that
think
that
covers
expert
witness
fees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
justice
alito
is
saying
we
have
discretion,
we
look
for
guidance,
we
have
guidance
from
congress.
they
have
adhered
to
the
$40
a
day
limit
in
very
important
cases;
why
don't
we
just
say,
justice
alito
is
suggesting,
that
this
is
--
that
this
is
a
good
guidepost
for
us
and
we
will
follow
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
are
saying
it's
our
discretion,
and
our
discretion
is
guided
by
what
congress
has
suggested
so
there
is
uniformity
in
the
system
and
so
forth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
we
--
how
do
special
master
fees
work?
the
special
master
always
has
fees,
and
the
parties
i
think
usually
divide
them.
how
does
that
--
how
is
their
authority
to
order
them--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
answer
is
--
is
at
all
adequate.
number
one,
what
is
there,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
that's
so
different
about
this
case?
let's
say
one
landowner
secretly
and
intentionally
is
stealing
another
landowner's
water,
and
--
and
he
has
no
legal
right
to
do
that.
and
the
only
way
the
injured
landowner
can
recover
is
to
hire
a
very,
very
expensive
expert,
a
hydrologist.
and
by
the
time
he
goes
to
court,
he
is
already
going
to
lose
the
benefit
of
the
damages.
congress
has
said
too
bad.
that's
the
way
it
is.
why
isn't
it
that
way
with
states,
especially,
as
justice
breyer
said,
when
states
can
really
afford
the
--
afford
it
better
than
the
landowner.
what's
the
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
i
think
you
gave
the
answer
earlier.
rule
53
allows
for
the
--
an
order
to
say
that
one
or
both
parties
shall
pay
the
special
master
fee.
so
if
we
are
going
to
follow
other
analogies,
we
don't
have
much
problem
here
with
expert
witness
fees
--
pardon
me
--
with
special
master
fees.
it's
under
rule
53.
of
course,
you
say
we
don't
have
to
follow
that
as
a
model,
but
it
is
a
model
if
we
--
if
we
were
to
look
to
congressional
and
--
and
to
other
rules.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
it
includes
printing
fees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
--
you
don't
think
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
number
here?
you
don't
think
that
1911
would
allow
the
clerk
to
charge
for
printing
fees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
reason
i
ask
is
because
printing
--
in
1920,
printing
and
witness
fees
are
in
--
in
the
same
sentence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
you
allowed
printing,
then
i
think
you
would
allow
witnesses
under
1911.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
1911
may
do
two
things:
number
one,
it
may
authorize
the
supreme
court
to
fix
the
fees
to
be
charged
by
the
clerk.
and
then
in
the
second
paragraph
it
provides
for
taxing
of
those
fees,
the
cost
of
serving
process,
and
other
necessary
disbursements.
so
it
does
two
things.
