if
your
reading
of
the
statute
is
correct,
then
i
take
it
we
would
have
the
discretion
to
decide
what
would
be
appropriate
expert
fees.
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
that
were
--
if
that's
so,
why
shouldn't
we
exercise
that
discretion
by
saying
that
the
expert
fees
that
are
available
in
a
case
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
should
be
the
same
as
the
expert
fees
that
would
be
available
in
a
district
court?
maybe
they
are
too
low
in
the
district
court,
but
why
should
there
be
--
why
should
we,
as
a
discretionary
matter
if
we
have
the
discretion,
provide
for
radically
different
fees
depending
on
the
court
in
which
the
case
originates?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
is
an
original
action
between
the
states
of
kansas
and
colorado
concerning
the
arkansas
river,
and
the
matter
now
before
us
concerns
kansas'
exception
to
the
special
master's
fifth
and
final
report.
kansas
is
the
prevailing
party
in
this
case
for
the
purpose
of
awarding
costs.
and
the
issue
before
us
relates
to
kansas'
application
to
recover
its
expert
witness
fees
as
costs.
the
special
master
concluded
that
28
u.s.c.
section
1821(b)
which
sets
the
witness
attendance
fee
for
a
proceeding
in
any
court
of
the
united
states
at
$40
per
day
applies
to
cases
within
this
court's
original
jurisdiction.
kansas
argues
that
this
provision
was
not
meant
to
apply
to
cases
within
our
original
jurisdiction,
and
that,
in
any
event
congress
lacks
the
authority
to
set
the
fees
that
are
recoverable
in
such
cases.
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
28
u.s.c.
section
1821(b)
is
not
controlling,
and
that
the
question
of
expert
fees
in
original
cases
is
left
entirely
to
our
discretion.
we
nevertheless
hold
that
the
amount
prescribed
by
that
statutory
provision
is
the
appropriate
amount
in
this
case.
we
see
no
good
reason
why
the
rule
for
recovering
expert
witness
fees
should
differ
markedly
depending
on
whether
a
case
is
originally
brought
in
one
of
the
district
courts
or
in
this
court.
it
is
our
view
that
the
best
approach
is
to
have
a
uniform
rule
concerning
witness
attendance
fees
that
applies
in
all
federal
cases.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
our
opinion
we
therefore
overrule
kansas'
exception
and
approved
the
entry
of
the
proposed
judgment
and
decree.
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
