justice
john
paul
stevens
general
six,
under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
1911
particularly,
would
the
court
have
authority
to
charge
your
fees
to
your
adversary,
shift
attorney's
fees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
make
such
a
request
in
this
case?
why
should
--
why
should
attorney's
fees
be
treated
differently
from
expert
witness
fees?
let
me
put
it
that
way.
or
should
it
be
treated
differently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
just
answer
my
question
of
a
moment
ago?
why
should
expert
witness
fees
be
treated
differently
from
attorney's
fees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
used
lawyers
to
prove
your
case,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
used
lawyers
to
prove
your
case,
too.
why
should
they
not
be
compensated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
an
answer
to
why
you
didn't
also
ask
for
attorney's
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
--
just
to
put
one
thing
on
the
table
if
i
could.
how
do
you
deal
with
the
problem
that
justice
ginsburg
raises:
if
a
court
wants
to
appoint
an
independent
expert
and
pay
him
more
than
$40
a
day?
do
you
say
that's
flatly
prohibited?
and
if
it's
not
flatly
prohibited,
what
is
the
authority
for
doing
so,
other
than
1911?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
authorizes
it?
doesn't
1911
authorize
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
what
does?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
don't
you
have
inherent
authority
to
pay
expert
witness
fees
a
little
more
money,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
spending
the
government's
money;
you're
spending
the
litigant's
money.
