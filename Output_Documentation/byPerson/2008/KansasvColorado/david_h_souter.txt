justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
if
they
hadn't
--
what
if
the
parties
hadn't
resolved
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
how
would
--
how
would
the
special
--
what
would
be
the
authority
of
this
court
to
make
an
order
that
the
special
master
be
paid
x
dollars?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
we
just
--
we
just
regressed
one
step.
where
does
the
authority
come
from?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
the
authority
to
compensate
is
inherent?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
making
--
would
you
make
an
inherent
authority
argument
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
regardless
of
original
jurisdiction
and
appellate
jurisdiction,
would
you
say
that
this
court
simply
has
the
inherent
authority
to
--
to
--
in
effect
to
decree
these
sorts
of
things?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
--
may
i
ask
you
a
statutory
question,
just
about
the
application
of
the
statute?
as
--
as
you
have
pointed
out,
if
the
$40
applies,
it's
because
it
is,
in
effect,
a
determination
of
a
particular
item
under
section
1920:
judge
and
clerk
of
any
court
of
the
united
states
may
tax
its
cost.
my
question
is
this:
one
of
the
items
covered
by
1920,
one
of
the
items
that
a
judge
or
clerk
may
tax,
is
fees
of
the
clerk.
under
section
1911,
which
relates
entirely
to
the
supreme
court,
there
is
a
provision
that
the
supreme
court
may
fix
the
fees
to
be
charged
by
its
clerk.
that
is
totally
redundant
if
1920
covers
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
doesn't
it
follow,
therefore,
that
section
1920
was
--
despite
its
reference
to
any
court
of
the
united
states,
doesn't
it
follow
that
that
statute
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
the
supreme
court?
and
doesn't
it
follow
from
that
that
either
the
supreme
court's
authority
is
to
fix
the
fees
if
this
is
a
fee
to
be
charged
by
the
clerk
or,
in
the
alternative,
that
there
is
no
statute
on
it
at
all?
but
the
main
point
is,
unless
1911
is
totally
redundant
in
--
in
referring
to
fixing
the
fees
to
be
charged
by
its
clerk,
then
1920
must
not
cover
the
supreme
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
greatly
flattered.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
not
the
first
to
have
done
that.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
we
didn't
--
no
question
about
that.
i
recognize
1920
goes
a
lot
further.
but
there's
no
--
there's
no
need
in
1911
to
say
that
the
supreme
court
may
--
may
fix
the
fees
to
be
charged
by
its
clerk
if
the
supreme
court
is
already
covered
by
1920.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
if
it's
redundancy,
it
proves
too
much,
is
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
get
clear
on
your
view
of
inherent
power?
as
i
understand
it,
you're
--
when
you
answered
it,
in
a
situation
in
which
the
slate
is
completely
clean,
we
would
have
inherent
power,
you're
using
"inherent
power"
in
effect
to
be
a
kind
of
default
power.
if
congress
hasn't
acted,
somebody
has
got
to
do
something.
that's
got
to
be
us,
so
--
so
we
would
have
the
authority.
but
you
are
not
using
the
term
"inherent
power"
in
the
sense
of
being
a
power
which
is
sort
of
essential
and
indefeasible
by
congress
in
any
respect.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
there
is
--
there
is
any
inherent
power
in,
let's
say,
this
court
--
just
keep
to
it
simple
--
that
congress
in
effect
could
not
eliminate?
for
example,
if
congress
passed
a
statute
saying
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
shall
not
have
authority
to
punish
direct
contempt,
would
that
statute
be
constitutional
in
your
view?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
a
pretty
slippery
slope
then
that
you're
on?
because
if
in
fact
parties
are
going
to
be
reluctant
to
--
to
hire
the
kind
of
experts
that
are
necessary,
unless
they
think
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
there
is
going
to
be
some
kind
of
an
equitable
disposition
of
the
expense,
at
that
point
that
starts
interfering
with
the
conduct
of
the
kind
of
business
that
the
court
ought
to
be
engaged
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
would
be
a
matter
of
due
process,
not
a
matter
of
inherent
power,
i
take
it.
