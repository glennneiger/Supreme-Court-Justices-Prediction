justice
antonin
scalia
but,
on
the
other
hand,
"court
of
the
united
states"
is
defined
specifically
to
include
the
supreme
court.
so
you
have
a
contradiction
no
matter
which
way
you
flip
it.
on
the
one
hand,
it
says
"judge",
which
does
not
include
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court.
on
the
other
hand,
it
says
"court
of
the
united
states",
which
does
include
the
supreme
court.
so
why
should
we
pick
one
--
one
answer
to
the
contradiction
rather
than
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
should
have
the
discretion.
why
do
you
keep
talking
about
the
special
master?
he's
just
--
he's
just
our
amanuensis.
ultimately
it's
our
discretion,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
assume
--
i
assume
your
answer
is
that
--
that
it's
our
business,
and
we
don't
have
to
agree
with
congress;
that
we
--
we
may
think
$40
a
day
for
the
zookeeper
and
for
albert
einstein
is
ridiculous.
and,
therefore,
if
it's
up
to
us,
we
would
adopt
a
different
rule.
isn't
that
your
answer?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
it
say
that
for
the
lower
courts?
i
mean,
you
are
--
you
are
trying
to
distinguish
what
it
can
say
for
the
supreme
court
when
the
supreme
court
is
the
trial
court
vis-a-vis
what
it
can
say,
and
has
said,
for
the
lower
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that,
so
long
as
congress
could
not
create
the
lower
courts
at
all,
once
it
creates
them
it
can
--
it
can
tie
their
hands
to
any
sort
of
absurd
rules?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
just
don't
agree
with
your
assumption
that
just
because
congress
need
not
have
created
any
lower
federal
courts,
the
only
federal
court
required
by
the
constitution
is
this
court,
therefore
once
congress
creates
them,
it
can
do
whatever
it
wants
with
them.
i
--
i
don't
agree
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
magical
about
original
actions?
i
mean,
what
--
what
is
magical
is
that
we
are
the
only
court
that
is
required
by
the
constitution.
but
we
are
--
we
are
not
just
the
only
court
for
original
actions
in
--
in
--
in
all
appeals.
can
congress
prescribe
division
of
costs
and
expenses
in
the
appeals
that
come
to
us
from
the
lower
federal
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
matter
of
unfairness
to
einstein
anyway.
i
mean,
you
know,
the
expert
witness
is
going
to
get
his
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
question
is
whether
one
side
can
get
some
money
from
the
other
to
help
pay
for
it.
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
at
the
time
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
was
established,
there
was
such
a
thing
as
the
charging
of
expert
witness
fees?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
constitution
says
that
no
money
shall
be
--
shall
be
withdrawn
from
the
treasury
except
by
appropriation
made
by
law.
i
think
--
i
think
you
need
a
law
to
spend
--
to
spend
the
government's
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask
you
what
--
what
are
the
fees
to
be
charged
by
its
clerk,
referred
to
in
1911.
"supreme
court
may
fix
the
fees
to
be
charged
by
its
clerk.
"
and
then
the
next
paragraph
says
"the
fees
of
the
clerk".
is
that
what
the
first
paragraph
refers
to,
the
fees
of
the
clerk?
or
does
it
mean
other
fees
that
the
clerk
charges
which
could
include
costs?
are
the
costs
part
of
the
fees
to
be
charged
by
the
clerk?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
not?
fees
of
the
clerk
--
in
1920
says
"fees
of
the
clerk
and
marshal.
"
but
that's
to
be
taxed
as
costs.
right?
a
judge
or
clerk
can
tax
as
costs
the
following.
1911
says
supreme
court
may
fix
"the
fees
to
be
charged
by
its
clerk.
"
and
you
say
that
doesn't
include
costs.
boy,
it's
a
messy,
messy
bunch
of
statutes,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
no
comfort.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
taxes
costs,
and
it
doesn't
say
the
supreme
court
may
fix
costs.
may
fix
the
fees
to
be
charged
by
its
clerk,
which
you
say
don't
include
costs.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
wouldn't
allow
to
us
fix
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
tells
you
how
they
are
to
be
taxed.
it
doesn't
say
what
their
level
is
to
be.
may
be
taxed
against
the
litigants
as
the
court
directs,
but
i
don't
see
any
authority
to
fix
them
--
fix
the
amounts.
it's
not
a
very
good
statute,
really.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
lawyers
get
even
more.
and
you
don't
get
that
back
either--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
if
congress
--
really
you
think
congress
could
set
any
--
there's
not
some
point
at
which
it
is
so
destructive
of
the
process
here?
what
if
congress
provides
that
the
winning
--
that
the
winning
party
shall
pay
the
costs
of
the
losing
party?
can
congress
do
that?
