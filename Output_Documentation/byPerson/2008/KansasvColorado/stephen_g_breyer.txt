justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
right.
they
--
all
different
--
they
did
a
lot
of
work
on
this.
i
--
i
know
they
did
a
lot
of
work
on
this.
congress
has
a
statute,
and
the
statute
is:
we
don't
care
if
the
witness
is
albert
einstein,
steven
spielberg,
or
the
local
zookeeper.
okay.
we
don't
care.
we
don't
care
if
they
did
a
lot
of
work
or
a
little
work.
we
want
them
to
be
paid
$40
a
day,
period.
it's
too
much
trouble
to
figure
out
how
much
work
they
did.
that's
what
we
want.
that's
the
law.
now,
justice
alito
said:
i
agree
with
you
for
argument's
sake;
we
are
not
bound
by
that
rule.
but
i
take
it
his
question,
which
i
heard
no
answer
to,
is:
assume
you
are
right;
we
are
not
bound
by
the
law;
still,
why
shouldn't
we
follow
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
any
example
where
congress
had
a
statute
which
says
every
court
in
the
united
states
must
pay
da-da-da,
whatever
that
number
is;
it's
$382.50,
okay.
now,
despite
that
clear
statute,
this
court
for
exactly
the
same
thing
paid
a
different
amount.
is
there
any
such
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
is
there
anything
in
the
--
in
the
nature
of
litigation?
and
there
might
be.
i'm
not
asking
it
as
a
rhetorical
question.
is
there
anything
in
the
nature
of
original
jurisdiction
lawsuits
that,
as
a
general
matter,
would
call
for
higher
fees
to
be
paid
for
witnesses,
or
to
make
a
distinction
between
expert
witnesses
and
others,
or
to
do
other
things
that
would
complicate
it?
i'm
not
speaking
of
your
case.
you
have
a
wonderfully
strong
case
in
your
case.
i
want
to
know
about
in
general,
in
original
actions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
anything,
the
parties
are
in
a
better
position
to
pay
the
money
than
the
average
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
unfair
to
have
a
rule
which
says
each
party
pays
his
own
experts,
win
or
lose.
that's
the
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
lose
this
case,
if
we
were
to
follow
congress,
we
would
have
adopted
a
rule
where,
because
the
$40
is
trivial,
each
party
pays
his
own
experts.
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
can
we
do
this
then?
i
think
maybe
in
many
cases
that
are
technical
of
nature
it
might
be
quite
a
good
thing
for
the
losing
party
to
pay
the
winning
side's
lawyers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
should
we
do
that,
too?
if
we
are
going
to
have
them
pay
the
experts,
why
don't
we
have
them,
the
losing
side,
pay
the
lawyers'
fees?
that
would
be
quite
a
revolution,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
--
i
mean,
if
you
want
to
really
get
a
little
complicated,
the
--
you
have
--
you
have
11,
and
11
talks
about
the
supreme
court
fees.
and
then
we
have
20
and
that
talks
about
all
the
other
fees,
right?
okay.
so
the
thing
is,
you
can't
pay
money
in
the
united
states
unless
have
you
some
authorization,
but
1911
gives
the
supreme
court
some
authorization
to
fix
fees.
now,
we
look
back
at
1821.
and
1821
tells
you
how
much
mileage
per
diem
and
subsistence
will
be.
it
says
he
will
be
paid
an
attendance
fee
of
$40
per
day.
doesn't
say
you
couldn't
pay
him
more.
just
says
that's
what
he
is
entitled
to.
now,
of
course,
in
the
lower
courts,
you
can't
pay
him
more
because
there
is
no
authority
to
pay
him
more.
but
in
the
supreme
court,
there
is
authority
to
pay
him
more.
that
comes
out
of
1911.
i
mean,
i
grant
you
that
this
is
--
what
i'm
actually
doing
here
is
i'm
trying
to
avoid
this
problem
of
whether
congress
can
start
legislating
the
details
of
original
jurisdiction
rules
and
so
forth.
just
--
there
is
some
desirability
here
constitutionally
to
prevent
ourselves
from
going
down
that
road.
that's
--
i'm
deliberately
being
gimmicky,
but
what
do
you
think
of
this
gimmick?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
fair.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
part
did
they
think
limited
it?
was
it
1821
they
thought
limited
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
an
ordinary
case,
if
a
witness
doesn't
--
never
does
go
to
court,
but
just
goes
to
a
deposition,
that's
the
only
thing,
he
goes
to
a
deposition,
does
he
get
paid
the
40
dollars?
he
goes
to
a
lawyer's
office;
he's
never
in
attendance
at
a
court.
but
do
they
count
that
as
being
in
attendance
at
a
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
where
is
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that
isn't
attendance
at
a
court,
where
did
these
witnesses
show
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where?
where
did
they
have
this
proceeding?
i
don't
know.
it
wasn't
here;
it
wasn't
in
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
courthouse?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
--
i
mean
now,
as
long
as
i'm
starting
down
the
road
to
outer
space,
why
not
--
could
we
say,
look,
they
were
very
impressive
models
these
people
did;
on
both
sides
they
had
terrific
experts,
very
expensive.
and
would
we
have
the
authority
to
say
to
the
master,
although
you
didn't
treat
them
as
your
experts,
you
should
have
done,
for
purposes
of
paying
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
to
be
unreasonable
about
this.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
i
got
mixed
up
on
my
dates.
the
words
"in
any
court
of
the
united.
"
--what
the
words
are
now
is
"in
any
court".
it
says
"court
of
the
united
states
includes.
"
451
courts.
when
did
that
language
come
in?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
'48?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
inclusion
wasn't
there
till
then.
now,
normally,
in
the
'48
revision,
the
rule
is
they
intended
to
make
no
substantive
change.
when
they
did
intend
to
make
a
substantive
change,
they
said
as
much.
so
is
there
anything
in
the
history
of
that
that
suggests
they
intended
to
make
a
substantive
change
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nothing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
other
words,
the
language
"in
addition
to
the
courts
listed
in
section
451
of
this
title.
"
that
--
those
words
i
just
said
have
no
appearance
in
the
statutes
before
1948?
yes
or
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
do
appear
before?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
they
do
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
first
time
in
1948.
so
they
were
put
in
there
by
a
revisor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
is
no
indication
the
revisor
intended
to
change
the
meaning
that
pre-existed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
got
the
argument.
thank
you.
