in
all
those
--
in
all
those
cases
has
the
special
master
ever
called
a
court
witness,
that
is
a
court
expert,
appointed
a
court
expert,
and
if
so
what
is
the
pay
rate
for
such
a
witness?
i
mean,
courts
of
the
united
states,
district
courts,
occasionally
appoint
witnesses,
court
witnesses
as
distinguished
from
parties'
witnesses.
do
you
know
if
that's
happened
in
special
master
situations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
whether
any
other--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
didn't
know,
in
answer
to
my
last
question,
what
the
practice
had
been,
but
with
respect
to
expert
fees
in
other
original
jurisdiction
cases,
has
the
court
ever
deviated
from
the
$40
or,
when
it
was
$30,
$30?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
have
they
ever
approved
a
special
master's
recommendation
of
a
rate
for
the
expert
witness
that
deviates
from
the
$40?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
--
do
you
know
whether
there
were
expert
witnesses
in
that
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
customary
for
it
to
be
divided
50/50?
i
mean,
we
periodically
will
approve
the
fees
that
the
special
master
charges,
and
then
they
are
divided
between
the
parties.
and
i
thought
that
they
were
divided
50/50.
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
don't
know--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
suthers,
do
we
know
what
has
happened
in
past
original
jurisdiction
cases?
maybe
it
hasn't
come
up
because
other
special
masters
have
said,
we'll
give
the
expert
witness
a
reasonable
fee
for
services
commensurate
with
the
qualifications
and
the
work
that
the
expert
has
done.
we
don't
know
if
that
has
or
hasn't
happened
in
the
past,
do
we?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
find
any
cases
where
the
special
master
had
appointed
his
own
witness
as
distinguished
from
the
parties?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
but
you
recognize
that
if
the
special
master
appointed
a
witness,
or
the
court,
that
that
witness
would
be
paid
a
compensatory
fee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
in
a
--
in
a
case
like
this
one,
where
the
nature
of
the
work
that
the
expert
did
seemed
to
be
very
helpful
to
both
sides,
isn't
it
odd
that
if
the
special
master
chose
the
court
expert,
that
expert
would
be
compensated
fairly,
but
if
you
have
one
party
calls
an
expert
who
renders
great
service
to
the
court,
to
both
sides,
doesn't
get
compensated,
isn't
that
an
anomaly?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
parties
pay
a
lot
--
a
lot
of
expenses,
and
then
they
may
be
--
may
or
not
be
reimbursed
to
the
prevailing
party,
but
the
prevailing
party
in
our
system
certainly
doesn't
get
anything
like
the
full
cost
of
the
litigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
constitution
uses
the
word
"judge".
a
"judge
of
the
united
states"
is
a
supreme
court
justice
or
a
judge
of
an
inferior
court.
