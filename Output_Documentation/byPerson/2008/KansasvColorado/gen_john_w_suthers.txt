mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
special
master
in
this
case
found
clear
direction
from
the
statutes
and
rightly
so.
section
1821
of
title
28
is
unambiguous.
it
provides
that
a
witness
in
attendance
at
any
court
of
the
united
states
shall
be
paid
an
attendance
fee
of
$40
per
day
in
addition
to
travel
and
accommodation
allowances.
section
451
of
title
28
defines
1948.
because
witness
fees
are
only
at
issue
in
the
supreme
court
in
cases
of
original
jurisdiction,
it's
apparent
that
congress
intended
the
limits
set
forth
in
1821
to
apply
in
such
cases.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
chief
justice,
it
would
then
be
up
to
the
court
to
decide
whether
that's
somehow
an
intrusion
into
your--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--authority--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--it
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
you've
allowed
congress
to
legislate
some
aspects
of
your
original
jurisdiction.
congress
has
told
you
in
what
is
now
section
1251
that
your
original
jurisdiction
is
not
entirely
exclusive.
only
state
versus
state
is
exclusive,
and
all
the
rest
of
your
original
jurisdiction
is
nonexclusive.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
chief
justice,
if
it
was
such
a
sensitive
issue,
why
is
it
we
are
now
in
2008
and
this
court
has
never
decided
to
enact
any
kind
of
rules--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--as
to
actual
witness
fees.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
justice
ginsburg,
we
--
we
looked
at
it
very
carefully
--
and
it's
difficult
to
research
--
but
we
could
not
find
an
original
jurisdiction
case
where
there
was
an
award
of
witness
fees
outside
the
--
this
$40
per
day
limitation.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
no.
we
did
not.
but--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--whatever
the
special
master
determined
was
appropriate.
that's
correct.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
the
special
master,
justice
ginsburg,
found
clear
direction
from
the
statute
and
did
not
believe
that
he
had
an
option
in
the
matter.
if
you're
talking
about
the
unfairness
of
it,
number
one,
this
situation
here
is
no
more
unfair
to
kansas
than
any
litigant
in
federal
court.
and,
number
two,
it's
an
appropriate
matter
to
take
to
congress.
the
last
time
they
changed
it
was
1990
from
$30
to
$40.
i
think
it's
time
to
revisit
it.
but
it
is,
in
fact,
what
congress
has
dictated
should
be
the
compensation--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--that's
correct,
justice.
they
certainly
did
in
this
case.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
both
sides
can
vouch
for
that.
[laughter]
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
justice
scalia,
i
do
not.
we
do
know--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--that
it's
1853
when
for
the
first
time
congress,
desiring
to
have
uniform
fees,
began
the
structure
of
expert
witness
fees.
it
started
at
$1.50
a
day,
in
1853.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
justice
ginsburg,
1920--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--justice
souter.
justice
souter,
sorry.
justice
souter.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
1920
--
there
may
be
some
redundancies
in
it,
but
it's
much
more
expansive
than
is
1911.
it
talks
about
court
reporter
fees,
printing--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--justice
souter,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
it,
1911
was
enacted
at
the
same
--
there's
a
separate
statute
--
statute
that
applies
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
the
district
courts.
i
think
it's
like
1913
and
1914.
so
i
--
i
--
i
don't
think
that
you
can--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--yes.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
i
think
the
important
thing
about
1911,
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
it
is
limited
to
fees
charged
by
the
supreme
court
clerk,
costs
of
serving
process,
and
incidental
disbursements.
it
does
not
address
witness
fees.
in
arlington--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--1911
does
not,
unless--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--incidental
disbursements?
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
as
an
incidental
disbursement,
it
may.
but
it
clearly
does
not
address
witness
fees.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
and
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
printing
would
be
considered
incidental
disbursements.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
i
do
know
that
in
arlington
central
school
district
v.
murphy,
citing
crawford
fitting,
this
court
made
clear
that
no
statute
will
be
construed
to
authorize
taxing
witness
fees
and
costs,
unless
it
refers
explicitly
to
witness
fees.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
well,
not
much.
[laughter]
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
this
court
--
this
court
has
decided
three
cases
regarding
the
application
of
1821.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
cases
in
which
litigants,
like
kansas,
were
trying
to
get
around,
in
federal
court,
this
witness
fee
limitation,
starting
with
crawford
fitting.
in
that
case,
you
held
that
a
prevailing
seeks
--
who
seeks
reimbursements
for
fees
paid
to
its
own
expert,
is
limited
by
the
statute
unless
we're
talking
about
a
contract
or
express
statutory
authority
to
the
contrary.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
yes.
and
by
the
way,
there
is
a
contract
here.
it's
the
compact
between
--
the
1949
compact
between
kansas
and
colorado,
and--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--i
don't
believe
so,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
but
it
is
liberally
construed.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
it's
liberally
construed.
you
don't
have
to--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--these
witnesses
show
up
for
trial.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
it
was
in
california.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
pasadena,
california,
for
272
days.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
yes.
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
they
show
up;
they
are
in
attendance;
it's
not
just
on
the
stand;
all
they
time
they're
there,
all
the
time
they're
traveling
back
and
forth.
it
is
liberally
construed.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
justice
stevens,
nothing
prevents
higher
compensation
for
a
court-appointed
expert.
we
are
talking
about--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--i
don't
believe
1911
does.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
the
inherent
authority
of
the
court.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
because
the
statute
addresses
that.
it
does
not
address--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--well,
in
the
case
of
the
--
of
the
court
appointing
an
expert,
it
is
typical
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
as
part
of
the
costs
for
the
judge
to
determine
what
was
an
appropriate
award
the
losing
party
--
what
they
should
pay
as
part
of
that
expert's
expense.
but
that's
not
what
we
are
dealing
with
in
1821.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
justice
breyer,
you
are
the
supreme
court
and
if
you
found
that
this
statute
----
[laughter]
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
yes.
if
you
found
that
this
statute
was
an
intrusion
which
somehow
violated
your,
you
know,
authority
as
a
court,
you
could
do
that.
but
why
would
you
want
to
get
into
the
business
--
going
to
justice
alito's
point
--
you
have
so
far
refrained
from
enacting
your
own
rules
on
this
highly
procedural
matter
of
expert
witness
fees.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
justice
roberts,
i'm
not
--
you
have
done
it
before
in
--
in
highly
procedural
matters
where
you
do
not
--
no
one
here
is
doing
anything
that
prevents
your
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction,
that
expands
your
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction.
the
cases
also
say
that
your
original
jurisdiction
is
self-executing,
doesn't
need
any
statutory
implementation;
but
this
is
a
--
a
totally
procedural
matter,
much
as
--
in
fact,
i
think
less
of
an
intrusion,
when
the
--
when
the
congress
said
to
you
these
cases
will
not
be
exclusive
jurisdiction.
even
though
they
are
part
of
your
original
jurisdiction.
this
is
a
very
procedural
matter.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
not
--
not
a
whole
lot
more
so
than
others
i've
seen.
[laughter]
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
by
the
way--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--it
has
been
pointed
out
to
me
in
response
to
this
compensation
of
court-appointed
experts
that
that
is
specifically
addressed
in
section
1920,
paragraph
6,
compensation
of
court-appointed
experts
is
covered
there.
so
there
is
that
statutory
authority
which
you
indicated
there
should
be.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
i
don't
believe
they
do.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
if
i
may,
once
again
going
to
the
issue
of
why
i
think
some
uniformity
is
important
in
original
jurisdiction
cases,
is
because
so
many
of
the
cases
are
not
exclusive
jurisdiction,
and
there
is
in
fact
a
need
for
uniformity
here.
and
the
fact
that
this
court
has
not
chosen
to
issue
a
conflicting
rule,
i
think,
is
very
significant.
if
in
fact
you
had
set
an
appropriate
fee
for
expert
witness
fees
in
case
original
jurisdiction,
and
congress
came
along
and
said,
gee,
no;
it
shouldn't
be
that,
you
should
be
stuck
with
$40,
then
we
might
have
some
kind
of
a
constitutional
issue
here,
but
absent
that,
i
simply
don't--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
i
would
urge
you
not--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--i
would
concede
that
you
--
you
probably
could.
but--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--your
inherent
authority
over
original
jurisdiction
cases.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
because
congress
is
entitled
--
you've
recognized
their
right
to
deal
with
certain
types
of
issues.
i
find
it
very
interesting
that
kansas
cited
florida
v.
georgia,
because
that
case
says
congress
has
undoubtedly
the
right
to
prescribe
the
process
and
mode
of
proceeding
in
original
jurisdiction
cases
as
fully
as
in
other
federal
courts,
but
that
the
omission
to
legislate
such
process
does
not
deprive
the
court
of
its
constitutionally
conferred
jurisdiction.
this
is
something
that
you
have
historically--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--chief
justice,
i
would
argue
that
the
setting
of
fees
is
a
procedural
matter,
and
it
is
--
and
has
to
do
with
the
mode
of
proceeding
in
a
case.
that's
correct.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
absolutely
not,
chief
justice.
and
in
fact,
of
course,
as
i
think
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
einstein
does
not
only
get
$40
a
day.
we
pay
them
a
lot
of
money,
but
congress
has
decided
$40
is
what
they
--
what
they
get.
congress
ought
to
revisit
it.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
they
certainly
do
not.
experts
in
this
case
were
paid
lots
and
lots
of
money,
and
they
don't
even
get
that
when
the
court
has
--
it's
not
--
at
least
the
trial
courts--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--that's
right.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
that's
correct,
justice
souter,
to
the
extent
that
there
was
nothing
applicable
to
this
and
it
came
before
you,
should
expert
witnesses
get
compensated
some
--
some
amount,
congress
hasn't
spoken
on
it,
i
would
think,
as
a
matter
of
default,
you
could
say
yes.
and
--
but--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--no,
justice
souter,
it
would
not
be
because
then
it's
interfering
with
your
ability
to
do
what
courts
do
as
a
central
matter.
you--
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
--justice
souter,
it's
not
telling
you
how
to
decide
cases.
and
there
is
another
case
before
the
court
in
which
congress
reinstated
time-barred
cases.
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
intrudes
on
your
judicial
function.
setting
witness
fees
doesn't
come
close
to
doing
that.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
it's
--
i
think
the
question
would
be,
justice
scalia,
is
that
a
fundamental
interference
with
the
court's
ability
to
decide
cases?
i
would
suggest
it
might
be
to
the
--
that
they
do
something
wholly
irrational
like
that.
mr.
gen
john
w.
suthers
i
believe
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
members
of
the
court,
special
master
littleworth
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
this
case.
he
has
been
fair,
competent,
and
conscientious
in
resolving
all
the
issues
before
this
court,
including
this
issue
of
expert
witness
fees.
it
was
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
clear
direction
of
the
case
law
that
led
him
to
his
conclusion
that
the
expert
witnesses'
fees
were
limited
by
statute
in
this
case.
we
would
ask
you
to
deny
kansas'
exception
to
the
final
report,
and
that
the
court
should
enter
the
proposed
judgment
and
decree.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
other
questions
from
the
court,
i'll
conclude
my
argument.
