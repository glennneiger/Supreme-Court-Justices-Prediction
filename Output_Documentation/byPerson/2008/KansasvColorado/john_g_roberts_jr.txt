chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
105
on
our
original
docket,
kansas
v.
colorado.
general
six.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
an
extremely
sensitive
clause
in
article
iii.
we
can
decide
this
case
without
relying
on
the
distinction
you
just
discussed,
can't
we?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
also
says
"clerk".
we
may
not
be
judges,
but
we
certainly
have
a
clerk.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
take
it
the
usual
practice
is
for
the
parties
to
settle
this
matter
and
submit
an
agreed
amount
to
the
special
master;
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
didn't
--
then
why
are
we
here?
i
mean,
we
are
talking
about
limited
amounts.
so
much
more
is
at
stake
on
the
merits,
and
why
wouldn't
the
parties
just
say,
well,
when
it
comes
to
special
master
fees
this
is
what
we
are
going
to
agree
to.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
limited
to
$40.
you
can
agree
as
part
of
a
global
settlement
to
whatever
you
want.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
haven't
seen
--
i
mean
the
$40
limitation
makes
absolutely
no
sense,
does
it?
i
mean
i
never
saw
an
expert
who
would
agree
to
spend
the
day
appearing
in
court
worth
being
called
an
$40.
i
mean
the
fact
that
--
i
guess
i'm
just
repeating
justice
scalia's
question.
the
fact
that
congress
has
picked
an
arbitrary
number
with
no
basis
in
reality
doesn't
mean
that
we
should
do
the
same.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
we
award
the
--
the
special
master's
fees
in
original
cases,
do
we
specify
who
will
bear
those
fees?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
include
the
special
master's
fees
as
part
of
the
costs
that
are
allocated?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
--
why
did
the
parties
agree
to
it
if
we
do
it?
in
other
words,
if
we
say
in
our
orders
who
bears
the
special
master's
fees,
why
--
why
would
the
parties
agree
to
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
mean
congress
has
done
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
general
suthers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
if
they
said,
in
original
actions
no
fees
shall
be
allowed
to
any
special
master
appointed
by
the
supreme
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
we
allow--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
we
allow
congress
to
regulate
fees
in
our
original
jurisdiction
in
that
matter,
it
seems
to
me
that
we've
given
up
the
principle
and
we
are
just
negotiating
over
price.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
this
an
area,
though,
where
we
should
be
particularly
sensitive?
in
other
words,
one
reason
that
we
were
given
original
jurisdiction
in
these
cases
is
that
the
states
were
afraid
of
what
congress
would
do
in
its
own
courts,
the
courts
it
set
up
--
might
set
up
under
the
constitution.
i
think
it
would
be
surprising
if
you
told
the
states
at
the
framing
that
congress
gets
to
regulate
this
original
jurisdiction
where
you,
for
example,
can
sue
the
federal
government,
that
--
i
think
that
would
be
surprising.
it
would
not
be
regarded
by
them
as
a
significant
safeguard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
would
want
to
get
into
the
business
because
it's
our
business;
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
yield
on
a
basic
point
like
this,
that
you're
giving
up,
who
knows
how
much?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
if
congress
had
done
nothing?
in
other
words,
let's
say
they
haven't
addressed
costs
at
all.
would
we
be
able
to
set
what
we
think
are
reasonable
attendance
costs?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
pursuant
to
what
authority?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
we
have
inherent
authority
in
original
jurisdiction
cases,
where
does
it
--
how
come
it
disappears
whenever
congress
decides
to
legislate
in
the
area?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
the
substantive
level
of
fees
a
mode
of
proceeding?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any
--
do
you
think
$40
a
day
for
an
expert
is
a
realistic
assessment
of
what
experts
charge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
general
six,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
no.
