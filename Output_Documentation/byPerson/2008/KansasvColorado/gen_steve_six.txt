mr.
gen
steve
six
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
article
iii
makes
a
clear
distinction
between
the
court's
appellate
and
original
jurisdiction,
and
expressly
grants
congress
power
to
make
exceptions
and
regulations
for
appellate
jurisdiction,
but
congress
is
not
granted
the
same
power
over
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
gen
steve
six
well,
i
think
can
you,
and
the
court
certainly
can
interpret
the
statute
not
to
even
reach
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
and
avoid
that
constitutional
conflict.
and
i
think
the
stronger
reading
of
the
statute
arrives
at
that
very
result.
the
statute
at
issue,
the
cost
provision,
28
u.s.c.
section
1920,
states:
"a
judge
or
clerk
of
any
court
of
the
united
states
may
tax
as
costs
the
following.
"
and
it
lists
six
subparagraphs,
including
subparagraph
3
at
issue
here,
fees
and
disbursements
for
printing
and
witnesses.
the
statute
has
two
terms
in
it
that
are
defined,
28
u.s.c.
section
451
that
is
defined
but
does
not
appear
in
the
cost
provision,
and
that
is
"justice
of
the
united
states".
"justice
of
the
united
states"
is
defined
as
"the
chief
justice
and
the
associate
justices
of
the
supreme
court.
"
the
cost
provision
says
"a
judge".
iii
judges.
mr.
gen
steve
six
you
don't
have
to
pick.
and
you're
correct,
"the
court
of
the
united
states.
"
is
defined
to
include
the
supreme
court.
but
the
strongest
reading
of
the
statute
gives
meaning
to
all
of
the
words
in
the
statute,
and
it
says
you
can
be
a
judge
who
appears
in
the
court
of
the
united
states.
and
if
you
think
about
it,
there's
a
circle
of
judges
that
are
defined
here
and
a
circle
of
courts
that
are
defined
here,
and
where
the
two
overlap,
where
you
are
both
a
judge
and
in
the
court
of
the
united
states,
the
statute
should
apply.
mr.
gen
steve
six
and
that--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--you
do,
and
28
u.s.c.
section
1911,
another
provision
in
title
28,
specifically
deals
with
the
supreme
court
clerk.
and
throughout
title
28,
the
supreme
court
is
treated
differently
than
the
lower
courts.
mr.
gen
steve
six
i
don't
think
the
court
would
refer
to
the
general
cost
statute
in
its
original
jurisdiction
cases
at
all
or
any
authorization
from
congress.
28
u.s.c.
19--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--i
mean,
i
would
--
if
your
assumption
is
congress
has
the
power
to
do
it
and
has
done
so
through
1911,
i
read
1911
more
as
simply
a
grant
of
the
discretion
the
court
already
has.
they
are
turning
over
to
the
supreme
court
the
power
to
have
the
clerk
set
costs.
mr.
gen
steve
six
no.
i
don't
believe
you
have
to
refer
to
1920.
mr.
gen
steve
six
because
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court,
congress
isn't
given
power
to
make
exceptions
or
regulations
over
original
jurisdiction.
and
in
the
219
years
of
the
court's
original
practice,
they
have
never
referred
to
a
congressional
cost
provision,
and--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--i
believe
the
expert
witness
fees
in
this
case
were
vital
to
the
resolution.
they
were--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--i
don't
believe
they
were
other
incidental
disbursements.
that's
not
our
position.
mr.
gen
steve
six
other
necessary
disbursements.
mr.
gen
steve
six
if
--
if
this
court
determines
that
congress
has
the
power,
and
it's
done
so
through
--
since
1911
--
has
the
power
and
done
it
from
1911,
i
certainly
would
accept
that
position
as
the
result.
however,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
i
think
the
expert
witness
costs
and
the
work
was
vital
to
the
resolution
of
the
case
here.
mr.
gen
steve
six
absolutely,
and--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--clearly,
the
court
has
the
power
to
make
that
rule
for
original
cases.
however,
the
original
jurisdiction
was
developed
when
the
states
agreed
to
submit
and
ratify
the
constitution,
submit
their
sovereign
immunity
to
resolution
in
the
original
jurisdiction
to
handle
unique
disputes
between
the
sovereign
states.
and
as
the
court
said
in
florida
v.
georgia
in
1854,
"the
analogies
and
rules
and
foundations
of
law
that
apply
to
private
parties
are
not
necessarily
a
good
fit
for
sovereign
states.
"
mr.
gen
steve
six
because
what
colorado's
position
is,
is
they
are
telling
you
that
the
special
master's
hands
were
tied;
that
the
special
master
couldn't
even
exercise
that
discretion
in
a
bright-line
rule
that
would
say
$40
a
day.
mr.
gen
steve
six
clearly,
the
court
would
have
the
power
to
do
that.
however,
there
has
only
been
approximately
200
original
jurisdiction
cases
in
the
219
years
of
the
court.
to
suggest
that
the
rules--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--i
can
tell
you
it
didn't
happen
in
this
case.
i
certainly
can't
speak
to
whether
it's
happened
in
other
cases
involving
special
masters,
so
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
certainly
1920
makes
a
distinction
for
court-appointed
experts
rather
than
the
expert
witnesses
appearing
under
subsection
3
of
1920.
i
think
the
important
point
to
consider,
though,
is
in
the
original
jurisdiction
the
court
in
its
219
years
of
developing
essentially
an
interstate
common
law
in
these
cases
has
never
relied
on
the
trilogy
of
cost
statutes
that
the
court
discussed
in
crawford
fitting,
which
is
essentially
colorado's
position:
you
have
to
apply
rule
54(d)
first
to
have
the
court
even
have
the
discretion
to
award
costs;
then
you
get
to
1920,
which
the
court
has
said
is
the
arena
of
costs;
and
only
after
that
do
you
get
down
to
1821,
which
tells
you
the
limit
is
$40
a
day.
mr.
gen
steve
six
sure.
rule
53
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
deals
with
special
masters
in
the
lower
courts.
it
has
no
application
here
and
wasn't
used.
the
special
master's
fees,
which
total
approximately
a
million
dollars,
just
shy
of
that,
were
resolved
by
the
parties
after
the
special
master
was
allowed
to
exercise
discretion
on
that
area
of
cost--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--if
they
hasn't
resolved
the
special
master's--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--well,
i
think
the
authority
of
the
court
comes
from
the
order
appointing
the
special
master
to
handle
the
case
and
to
do
the
specific
things
that
were--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--to
appoint
a
special
master?
mr.
gen
steve
six
it's
an
inherent
authority
the
court
has
in
original
jurisdiction
cases.
mr.
gen
steve
six
the
authority
to
compensate
is
inherent.
in
the
judiciary--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--yes.
the--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--well,
again
there
is
a
distinction
between
appellate
and
original.
and,
focusing
on
original,
i
think
the
court
has
entirely
the
authority.
the
judiciary
act
of
1789,
which
gave
the
court
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
these
disputes,
didn't
set
forth
any
procedures
to
govern
the
disputes.
that's
always
been
carefully
preserved
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
apply
to
each
unique
dispute.
mr.
gen
steve
six
yes.
in
the
original
jurisdiction
the
court
would
have
the
inherent
authority
to
do
fee-shifting
if
the--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--the
special
master
should
have
the
discretion
to
consider
all
the
costs
and
the
unique
circumstances
of
the
case.
in
this
case,
we
chose
expert
witness
fees--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--it
is,
and
the
benefit
of
having
the
special
master
make
a
recommendation
is
we
could
have
gone
through
these
different
categories
of
costs
and
come
up
with
a
recommendation.
the
court
certainly
could
have
learned--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--the
way
it's
worked
in
this
case
is
the
special
master
has
provided
guidance,
like
on
the
special
master's
fees.
the
special
master
suggested
it
wouldn't
be
unfair
to
award
them
two-thirds
colorado,
one-third
kansas.
after
that
the
parties
resolved
it,
just
like
we
resolved
every
other
issue
of
cost
where
the
special
master
was
allowed
to
apply
that
discretion.
mr.
gen
steve
six
well,
the
special
master's
fees
we
resolved.
the
experts
fees
at
issue
here,
of
course
that
bright-line
rule
was
drawn
by
the
special
master,
and
he
never
was
allowed
to
make
a
recommendation
to
the
court
to
consider
that.
in
balancing
--
the
remedies
in
these
cases
are
highly
equitable
remedies
that--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--well,
in
this
case
they
should
be
treated
differently
because
the
model
at
issue
that
the
experts
for
kansas
developed,
the
h-i
model,
was
used
to
prove
our
claims
at
trial,
which
would
have--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--excuse
me?
mr.
gen
steve
six
because
we
considered
the
special
circumstances
of
the
model.
it
proved
the
claims
at
trial.
it
was
adopted
by
the
court
in
2004
in
kansas
v.
colorado
to
monitor
compliance
in
the
arkansas
river
basin.
it's
the
water
use
--
it's
applied
by
the
colorado
state
water
use
rule.
so
it
was
special
features
like
that
that
we
wanted
to
present
to
the
special
master
to
explain
why
the
fees
should
be
fairly
balanced
and
divided
in
a
way
other
than
he
did.
mr.
gen
steve
six
well,
in
a
particular
case
where
perhaps
a
order
of
the
supreme
court
wasn't
followed
or
some
other
situation
developed,
fee
shifting
may
be
appropriate.
in
this
case
we
felt
the
expert
model
we
developed
was
so
vital
that
it
would
be
persuasive
to
the
special
master
and
fair
and
equitable
to
award
it
to
us.
mr.
gen
steve
six
so
that
was
the
distinction.
mr.
gen
steve
six
in
original
cases
the
court
has
never
referred
to
any
of
that
trilogy
of
cost
statutes
discussed
in
crawford
fitting.
mr.
gen
steve
six
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes
and
i
would
direct
the
court
to
new
jersey
v.
new
york
in
1931,
which
was
a
division
of
the
waters
of
the
delaware
river.
and
the
court
pointed
out
in
that
opinion
that
a
mass
of
evidence
was
presented
to
the
special
master,
and
on
costs
the
court
said:
"the
cost
of
the
cause
shall
be
divided
35
percent
to
new
jersey,
35
to
city
of
new
york.
"
and
so
on.
the
"cost
of
the
cause"
i
would
argue
is
the
cost
to
get
the
case
to
the
point
where
it
was
resolved.
in
the
boundary
dispute--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--it
does
not
say
in
the
published
opinion
exactly
what
the
cost
of
the
cause
is.
however,
from
a
fair
reading
of
the
--
the
water
distribution
issues,
i
wouldn't
imagine
it
would
be
possible
to
do
that
without
experts.
but
i
would
point
the
court
to
the
boundary
dispute
cases
where
the
court
has
discussed
the
costs
of
surveyors,
mappers,
geographers,
historians,
and
divided
the
costs
in
boundary
disputes
equally
between
the
states
--
not
each
state
to
bear
their
own
cost,
but
divided
them
equally.
and
the
--
the
experts
that
are
involved
in
resolving
a
boundary
dispute,
i
think,
are
no
different
than
the
hydrologists
and
engineers
and
the
type
of
experts
that
we
used
in
this
case.
mr.
gen
steve
six
because
in
the
original
cases
the
court
has
always
tried
to
reach
an
equitable
balance--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--i'm
not
aware
of
that--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--i
would
suggest
the
only
difference
is
the
parties.
and
the
court
in
its
219
years--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--that's
exactly
my
answer.
and
if
you
think
--
if
congress
can
adopt
a
congressional--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--the
difference
is
the
court
has
indicated
for
original
cases:
these
are
such
disputes
of
a
serious
magnitude
that
can
affect
whole
populations
that
the
model
case
for
even
taking
a
case
is
where
the
acts
between
the
states
would
be
a
causus
belli,
a
type
of
thing
that
would
lead
to
war.
the
rules--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--i
would
agree.
the
special
master's
fees,
for
example,
for
one
person
--
and
he
was
an
excellent
special
master
--
were
almost
a
million
dollars.
the
appearance
fees
for
the
22
experts
kansas
had
amounted
to
approximately
$30,000.
so
that
difference
there,
i
think,
demonstrates
the
very
unfairness
of
the
fact--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--i
don't
think
that's
the
rule
in
original
jurisdiction
cases.
mr.
gen
steve
six
at
least
the
court
has
never
said
that.
the
court
has--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--i
think
that's
correct,
but
we
didn't
lose.
and
the
court
found
that
kansas
proved
that
colorado
violated
the
compact
for
over
--
for
over
50
years
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
but
one
point
i'd
like
to
make--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--the
court
would
have
that
ability
to
do
that
in
original
jurisdiction--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--because
in
the
original
jurisdiction
cases
involving
prevailing
parties
or
litigious
cases,
the
court
has
traditionally
and
historically
awarded
the
prevailing
party
costs.
and
if
congress
can
make
a
congressional
limitation
on
cost,
congress
could
pass
a
statute
that
says:
you
have
to
take
all
original
jurisdiction
cases,
or
you
can't
use
special
masters,
or
you
can't
use
certain
special
masters
in
cases
involving
colorado
and
kansas.
mr.
gen
steve
six
yes,
it
could
say
that
for
the
lower
courts.
mr.
gen
steve
six
because--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--i
think
they
could
pass
a
rule
like
they
did,
rule
54
--
53,
which
allows
for
special
masters,
and
they
could
through
the
rules
enabling
act
pass
a
rule
that
says
you
can't
use
special
masters.
i
think
you
get
into
whether
that's--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--well,
i
would
certainly
focus
more
on
the
original
jurisdiction
issue
here
and
haven't
focused
as
much
on
that
issue,
but--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--yes,
you
do.
and
--
you
do
in
the
cases
that
have
discussed
costs.
for
instance,
in
boundary
dispute
cases
you
have
suggested
that
the
cost
--
the
costs
will
be
divided
equally;
in
litigious
cases,
that
they
will
be
awarded
to
the
prevailing
party.
mr.
gen
steve
six
yes,
and
in
this
case
the
parties
have
agreed
to
that
and
never
made
an
issue
about
that.
and
there
is
no--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--well,
in
this
case
--
maybe
i
misheard
your
question.
the
order
appointing
the
special
master
did
not
resolve
the
issue
of
fees.
mr.
gen
steve
six
and
the
parties
did
not
agree
to
that
ahead
of
time.
it
was
an
issue
to
be
determined
and
decided
at
the
end
of
the
litigation.
mr.
gen
steve
six
well,
as
the
case
progressed,
the
special
master
submitted
bills
that
were
divided
50/50.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
the
parties
suggested
reasons
and
special
circumstances
that
should
allow
the
special
master
to
apply
discretion.
he
then
suggested
it
wouldn't
be
unfair
to
award
the
special
master
fee
costs
two-thirds
colorado,
one-third
kansas
because
of
the
unique
features
of
the
case.
and
the
parties
then
settled
the
special
master
fees
with
that
guidance.
mr.
gen
steve
six
it
is
a
model;
however,
the
court
has
always
carefully
preserved
its
discretion
to
treat
each
dispute
between
the
sovereign
states
as
a
unique
dispute.
and
the
court
never
even
enacted
an
original
action
rule
until
1939,
so
after
150
years.
and
in
1939
the
court
enacted
rule
5,
which
just
set
up
the
bare
minimums
of
commencing
the
action.
and
rule
17
today
has
essentially
the
same
framework
that
tells
the
parties
how
to
start
the
action
but
reserves
all
the
other
rules
to
the
discretion
of
the
special
master.
it
does
point
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
the
rules
of
evidence
as
guides
but
not
binding,
mandatory
rules
that
tie
the
court's
hand.
mr.
gen
steve
six
well,
the
court
has,
in
1913,
determined
that
--
excuse
me,
in
1912,
that
when
a
case
is
affirmed,
the
supreme
court
can
adjudge
costs
for
damages
and
delay.
so
they
have
directed,
i
think,
a
--
a
regulation
at
the
appellate
jurisdiction,
but
never
at
the
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
gen
steve
six
congress,
i'm
sorry.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gen
steve
six
1920
didn't
appear
in
1948
magically.
it
came
from
the
1853
fee
act.
and
the
language
in
the
fee
act
was,
"a
judge
shall
tax
costs".
"a
judge"
--
it
says,
"costs
shall
be
taxed
by
a
judge
or
clerk
of
the
court.
"
i'm
sorry.
and
1920
says,
"a
judge
or
clerk
of
any
court
of
the
united
states.
"
in
1853,
as
the
court
has
discussed
in
alyeska
pipeline,
the
fee
act
applied
to
the
circuit
and
district
courts.
it
says
that
in
its
title.
and
1853
meant
a
lower
court
judge.
in
1920,
we
have
exactly
the
same
word
--
"a
judge"
who
can
tax
costs
--
and
we
have
a
definition
that
congress
tells
us
it
means
exactly
the
same
thing.
under
colorado's
reading,
451
in
title
28
defines
"justices"
as
a
separate
group.
so
that's
not--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--and
certainly
congress
isn't
tied
to
the
way
the
word
is
used
in
the
constitution,
no
more
than
the
paper
i
got
on
my
way
in
here
told
me
not
to
refer
to
any
of
you
as
"judges".
the
point,
i
think,
is
that
the
fee
act
was
carried
forward
to
1920,
and
the
language
is
almost
the
same.
the
only
thing
they
have
added
is
a
definition
of
"court
of
the
united
states".
and
if
after
168
years,
congress
is
going
to
tread
on
the
court's
original
jurisdiction,
they
ought
to
at
least
have
some
express
language
that
they
intend
to
do
that
--
do
so,
where
the
court
could
at
the
very
least
adopt
a
clear
statement
rule
that
would
require
congress
to
say,
"we
are
going
to
do
this
now.
"
"we've
never
done
it
in
our
history,
but
now
after
168
years
we
are.
"
not
only
that,
colorado's
position
relies
on
the
fact
that
they
did
this
in
1948,
and
it's
gone
unnoticed
by
the
court,
any
major
treatise,
or
commentary--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--in
1948.
mr.
gen
steve
six
yes.
mr.
gen
steve
six
no,
there
isn't.
and
they
changed--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--they
changed--
mr.
gen
steve
six
--yes.
mr.
gen
steve
six
no.
mr.
gen
steve
six
first
time
in
1948.
mr.
gen
steve
six
yes.
mr.
gen
steve
six
yes.
mr.
gen
steve
six
and
they
did
change
something
else.
they
changed
"shall"
to
"may",
and
they
gave
a
reason
for
that
change.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
