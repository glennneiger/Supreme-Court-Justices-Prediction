justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
how
does
that
differ
from
you
using
your
printer
and
there's
an
ink
cartridge
and
you
replace
them
after
a
while,
and
mine
has
a
little
thing
attached
that
says
don't
put
it
in
your
ordinary
garbage
bin
because
it's
dangerous
or
whatever
it
is,
put
it
in
this
envelope
and
do
something?
now,
i'm
sure
that
hp
makes
those
and
knows
that
several
million
people
won't
do
it.
they
will
throw
it
in
the
garbage
bin,
and
they
ship
to
it
me.
all
right.
are
they
now
arrangers?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
some?
oh,
probably
millions.
i
don't
know
anybody
who
does
put
it
in
the
right
garbage
bin.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
how
is
that
then
different
from
shell?
shell
here
knows
that
to
some
degree
their
people
are
going
to
spill
this.
and,
of
course,
shell
arranged
the
transport.
and
in
my
imaginary
hypothetical
--
i
don't
really
know
--
so
does
hp.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
now
maybe
hp
knows
that
there
is
a
particularly
bad
customer
like
breyer
who
----
[laughter]
--because
i
foolishly
admitted
at
dinner
that
i
dispose
of
them
all
improperly.
now
are
they
shell?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
then,
suddenly
if
hp,
in
fact,
uses
--
i
guess
they
lease
--
you
know,
they
have
a
common
carrier,
imagine
--
or
suppose
it's
car
batteries,
same
problem.
they
have
their
own
trucks,
and
they
--
or
they
use
fed
ex;
i
don't
know.
and
they,
in
fact,
put
in
an
instruction,
which
says:
really
do
it;
really
put
it
in
the
special
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
find
that
point.
and
what
i
have
found
you
so
far
to
say
from
the
briefs
is
that
what
shell
here
did
--
i'm
not
saying
it
easy
--
but
what
they
did
was
they
arranged
the
transport,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
common,
and
they
put
some
instructions
in
which
said
the
right
way
to
dispose
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
doesn't
everybody
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then,
in
your
view,
what
it
is,
is
a
company
arranges
with
a
transporter
for
disposal
when
the
company
knows
that
the
transporter
on
arrival
may
spill
some
of
the
product?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
then
every
oil
company
--
well,
i
mean,
every
liquid
product
company
in
the
united
states
is
going
to
be
--
fall
within
that
because
a
lot
of
people
do
spill
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
that's
the
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
that
point,
because
i
think
you're
focusing
on
the
word
--
you
don't
use
the
word
"for"
disposal,
and
i
think
that
is
the
key
word,
and
the
question
is
intention
versus
purpose.
so
that
in
your
trash
hauler
case,
it
seems
to
work
pretty
well
for
me
that
when
we
say
that
that
trash
truck
of
course
intended
in
the
sense
that
it
was
its
purpose
to
dispose
of
the
trash
when
it
got
to
the
dump,
but
the
leakage
along
the
way
--
it
was
not
its
purpose.
so
how
do
we
deal
with
that?
the
statute
tells
us
that
they
are
an
owner
of
a
facility
or
a
vessel
that
leaks,
and
therefore
they
are
liable
that
way.
now,
that
seems
to
work.
so
we
get
your
example.
what
doesn't
seem
to
work
is
when
you
import
the
notion
of
intention,
in
the
sense
of
knowing
that,
to
the
arranger
provision,
because
at
that
point
i
don't
see
how
--
and
i
have
to
buy
that
to
get
your
argument.
at
that
point
i
do
not
see
how
you
get
every
thing
of
clorox
on
the
shelf
in
the
supermarket
and
don't
put
clorox
right
in
the
arranger
provision
and
lots
of
other
companies
that
shouldn't
be
held
as
arrangers.
that's
my
problem.
are
you
following
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does
say
that,
but
my
problem
is
i
can't
find
in
the
distinctions
that
they
made
useful
distinctions
that
will
do
that.
it
will
say
"many",
but
it
won't
say,
for
example,
the
car
battery
manufacturer
who
sends
his
car
batteries
out
in
his
own
trucks
to
places
where
people
will
get
them,
and
he
knows
that
they're
not
going
to
do
it
properly
no
matter
how
hard
he
tries.
well,
he's
not
an
arranger.
he
didn't
arrange
the
transport
for
disposal;
he
arranged
the
transport
for
sale.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
no,
but
suppose
that
that
cost
--
that
single
thing
cost
$2
million,
and
you
will
have
to
hire
that
$2
million
machine
even
if
there
is
one
drop.
so
for
the
cost
of
that
machine
it
couldn't
matter
if
your
client
put
in
one
drop
and
nobody
else
put
in
any,
or
the
others
put
in
40
billion
drops.
can
you
allocate
it?
it
would
seem
fair
to
allocate
it,
but
i
guess
maybe
in
the
restatement
or
there's
some
law
somewhere
saying
you
can't,
because
it's
just
one
single
cost
that
takes
place
regardless.
what's
the
state
of
the
law
on
that?
