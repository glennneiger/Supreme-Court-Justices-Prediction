ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
with
section
912
of
the
restatement
because
i
think
it
really
helps
to
demonstrate
that
the
trial
court
fully
understood
and
properly
applied
the
common-law
standards
that
govern
the
determination
of
apportionment
in
a
pollution
case.
that
section
provides
that
when
a
party
bears
the
burden
of
proof,
they
have
to
establish
the
extent
of
harm
and
the
amount
of
money
with,
quote,
"as
much
certainty
as
the
nature
of
the
tort
and
circumstances
permit.
"
end
quote.
at
the
time
that
cercla
was
adopted
in
1980,
common-law
courts
for
more
than
a
century
had
been
using
that
standard
to
apportion
damages
and
harm
in
pollution
cases
based
on
essentially
rough
estimates
because
the
nature
of
the
tort,
pollution,
and
the
circumstances
don't
allow
for
the
kind
of
precision
that
we
might
require
in
some
other
settings
such
as
proof
of
--
of
fault,
for
instance.
and
the
united
states
--
they
say
that
the
district
court
departed
from
those
common-law
standards,
but
it's
telling:
they
don't
cite
a
single
common-law
case
decided
before
cercla
in
their
entire
brief.
if
you
were
to
look
at
section
840e
of
the
restatement,
which
governs
nuisance
cases
and
apportionment
--
it's
an
application
of
the
section
433a
standards
--
they
cite
--
the
restatement
cites
approximately
50
cases.
i
don't
think
there's
a
single
one
where
a
court
denied
apportionment
for
a
nuisance
for
a
harm
such
as
this
one
that
is
theoretically
capable
of
apportionment--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
in
note
16
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
it
actually
rejects
that
argument
by
the
government.
it
says
that
apportionment
was
pled
throughout
the
case;
that
the
government
was
on
notice.
that's
note
16.
the
trial
court
very
specifically
rejected
the
government's
claims
of
waiver
saying,
yes,
apportionment
was
at
issue
here
throughout
the
case,
both
in
terms
of
the
pleadings--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--oh,
he
does
say
that,
your
honor.
but
what
he
says
is
that
the
theory
of
apportionment
that
was
offered
by
the
railroad,
the
argument
that
they
made
--
they
offered
kalinowski,
an
expert
that
gave
substantial
precision
about
how
to
allocate
harm
among
the
different
chemicals
on
the
site.
he
doesn't
accept
that
approach.
he
accepts
a
different
approach.
but,
at
252a,
he
says
--
he
confirms
--
there
is,
quote,
"considerable
evidence
of
the
relative
levels
of
activities
and
number
of
releases
on
the
two
parcels.
"
that
allow
him
to
find
a
basis
of
--
for
making
a
reasonable
estimate
of
the
apportionment,
which
was
his
responsibility
as
a
factfinder.
in
addition,
your
honor--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
your
honor,
the
finding
of
apportionment
was
sought.
the
trial
court
--
and,
again,
note
16
of
the
--
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
makes
clear
--
and
the
government
doesn't
say
otherwise
--
that
the
railroads
had
requested
apportionment.
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
they
had
argued
the
precise
theory,
and
the
factfinder
certainly
has
the
authority
to
choose
the
theory
that
it
thinks
best
approximates
what
is
a
reasonable
estimate.
and
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
theory
that
the
trial
court
seized
upon
was
actually
suggested
by
the
government's
own
expert
on
cross-examination
in
the
transcript
at
--
at
4077
to
'78.
and
in
addition,
your
honor,
when
it
was
time
for
closing
argument,
which
was
september
28th,
1999,
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
transcript,
page
4,
the
trial
court
said
to
the
government
--
said
to
the
parties
at
the
beginning
of
the
closing
argument,
here's
what
i
want
to
know
about.
i
want
you
to
address
yourselves
to
whether
or
not
i
can
apportion
this
harm
based
upon
the
relative
area
on
the
site
and
the
relative
time.
he
put
the
government
on
notice.
when
the
findings
of
fact
came
out,
your
honor,
the
government
could
have
filed
a
motion
to
amend
under
rule
52.
they
in
fact
filed
a
motion.
they
could
have
asked
to
submit
additional
evidence
if
they
somehow
thought
that
this
had
been
unfair.
they
didn't
do
that.
shell
did
it
for
other
reasons,
but
the
government
elected
not
to.
so--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--it
absolutely
could
have.
and
so
that
argument
of
waiver
was
rejected
by
two
courts
below,
both
by
the
district
court
in
denying
the
motion
to
amend
--
it
granted
it
in
certain
respects,
but
rejected
waiver
--
and
then
by
the
ninth
circuit
as
well.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
it
depends,
but
generally
yes.
and
the
reason,
if
it,
as
here
--
the
cost
of
the
remedy
is
driven
by
the
mass
of
the
contamination
--
and
it
was
undisputed
that
that
was
the
case
here
--
then
the
costs
have
gone
up
based
upon
the
aggregate
harm.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
but
it's
that
the
whole
cost
--
the
question
under
apportionment
is:
are
all
of
the
damages
attributable
to
the
harm
that
was
caused
by
the
defendant?
and
if
they're
not,
then
apportionment
is
appropriate.
and
here--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
your
honor,
under
--
the
government
has
acknowledged
that
the
apportionment
standards
from
the
restatement
apply
under
the
--
under
cercla.
and
cases
--
as
i
indicated,
the
cases
under
840e
almost
always
allowed
apportionment
for
pollution,
even
though
it
meant
that
a
farmer
or
a
rancher
or
a
grower
was
left
holding
--
with
harm
that
was
caused
by
another
defendant.
but
the
law
has
always
said
you
can't
impose
damages
on
a
defendant
that
had
no
causal
responsibility.
here
what
we're
talking
about,
under
the
ninth
circuit's
holding,
that
they
--
they
didn't
question
the
district
court's
factfinding
at
248a
that
it
is
indisputable
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
hazardous
substances
were
released
by
b&b
on
its
own
parcel,
on
its
own
land,
not
on
the
railroad's
land.
its
own
operations
on
its
own--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--the
trial
court
found
that
it
was
plausible
that
some
leakage,
some
spills
on
the
railroad
parcel,
during
the
13
years
of
the
lease
made
it
into
the
groundwater
by
traveling
nearly
two
football
fields
in
an
area
that
hardly
has
any
rain,
but
said
that
9
percent
was
the
maximum
of
damages
that
could
possibly
be
attributable
to
this.
what
the
ninth
circuit
really
says
is
that,
even
though
b&b
began
dumping
thousands
of
gallons
of
chemical
rinsate
in
1960,
which
was
36
years
before
this
case
was
filed,
15
years
before
the
lease
was
ever
entered
into,
that
all
of
that
harm
that
was
caused
by
b&b
has
to
be
paid
by
the
railroads,
because
they
can't
--
and
that's
almost
$40
million
now
--
because
they
can't
prove
with
precision
whether
their
share
of
the
damages
might
be
zero
or
one
million
or
nine
million
or
--
and
so
what,
in
essence,
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
said
that
because
there
weren't
adequate
records
to
prove
what
amount
of
--
of
dumping
was
going
on
in
1960
when
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
reason
to
keep
those
records,
that
as
a
default
matter
100
percent
of
the
harm
has
to
be
allocated
by
the
railroads,
even
though
it's
not
--
they
didn't
question
the
district
court's
finding
that
it's
indisputable
that
the
overwhelming
majority
was
by
b&b
on
its
own
land.
and
the
court
has
to--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--actually,
that's
--
your
honor,
what
it
actually
says
is
that
the
district
court
in
exceptional
cases
may
deny
apportionment
due
to
insolvency.
and
here
the
district
court,
at
248a,
found
this
was
not
such
a
case,
exercised
its
discretion
to
say
no.
and
in
addition,
your
honor,
there
are
no
cases
cited
in
--
in
that
section
of
the
restatement
where
this
was
actually
done.
and
the
third
restatement
in
section
28,
comment
c,
says
that
that
comment
was
actually
inconsistent
with
section
433a
principles.
thank
you.
