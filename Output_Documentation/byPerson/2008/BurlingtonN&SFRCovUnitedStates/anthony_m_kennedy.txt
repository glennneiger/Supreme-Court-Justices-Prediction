justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
that
it's
shell's
truck
--
that
isn't
this
case,
but
suppose
it's
shell's
truck,
and
every
time
they
make
a
delivery
the
driver
catches
the
waste
in
a
can,
four
or
five
gallons,
and
dumps
it
in
the
creek.
is
shell
liable
there
under
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
hasn't
it
arranged
for
the
disposal
of
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
your
answer.
can
you
give
me
an
example
under
this
statute
where
shell
might
be
an
arranger
--
give
me
some
hypothetical
in
which
shell
would
be
an
arranger?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
that
the
case
in
my
hypothetical
--
it's
just
a
hypothetical
--
where
the
driver
catches
the
five
gallons
that
spills
out
of
the
hose
every
week
and
dumps
it
in
the
creek?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
really
the
same
as
the
question
you
answered
justice
souter,
and
that's
an
arranger
under
3.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
it
waste
when
it
spills?
you
deliver
--
you're
supposed
to
deliver
100
gallons,
5
gallons
spills;
isn't
that
waste?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
know
that
--
hypothetical.
they
know
that
in
the
course
of
delivery
you're
always
going
to
spill
about
five
gallons.
that's
waste.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--all
i'm
talking
about
is
just
a
hypothetical
definition
of
"waste",
and
then--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
we
were
talking
about
waste,
and
i
just
wanted
to
get
your
agreement
--
maybe
you
won't
agree
--
that
when
the
product
is
delivered
and
5
percent
of
it
spills,
that
is
waste.
and
we
can
talk
about
the
other
parts
of
it
later.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
suppose
the
district
court,
if
it
wanted
additional
evidence,
could
have
said,
i
want
additional
evidence
on
this
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
shell
liable
because
it
--
it
knew
of
the
transportation
arrangements?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
have
--
you
might
have
knowledge
that
one
chemical
broker
is
more
careless
than
another
in
the
way
the
product
was
ultimately
sold.
i
don't
see
why
your
theory
doesn't
make
the
seller
liable
as
an
arranger
if
it
knows
or
ought
to
know
that
at
some
point
in
the
distribution
process
there
is
likely
to
be
spillage
which
will
enter
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
i
think
that's
what
your
argument
implies.
i
don't
see
that
in
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ms.
sullivan,
just
on
the
apportionment
point,
do
you
agree
that
it's
your
burden
to
show
that
this
is
a
divisible
harm,
and
can
you
tell
me
how
you
showed
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
really
concerned
about
the
time
and
the
white
light,
but
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
you
answered
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
about
the
$2
million,
which
was
an
initial
clean-up
that
has
to
be
expended
no
matter
how
large
the
--
the
spill
was.
how
did
you
discharge
your
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
that
is
not
the
case
here
or
that
that
is
divisible?
