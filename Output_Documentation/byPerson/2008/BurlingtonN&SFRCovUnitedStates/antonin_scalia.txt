i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
similarly
answered
justice
kennedy's
question
differently
and
would
have
said
that
just
because
something's
wasted
doesn't
mean
that
it
is
waste.
i
mean,
you
may
waste
part
of
what
is
delivered,
but
what
is
spilled
is
--
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
waste.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
say
in
the
process
of
delivery.
i
thought
that
this
material
became
the
property
of
the
buyer
when
the
truck
arrived.
are
you
saying
it
only
--
it
only
became
the
property
of
the
buyer
when
it
was
unloaded
from
the
truck?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
fob>
["]
normally
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
--
i
think
it's
something
of
a
misdescription
to
say
that
this
spillage
is
occurring
in
the
course
of
delivery.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
as
far
as
shell
was
concerned,
delivery
had
been
made
when
the
truck
pulled
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
making
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
it
could
have
--
could
have
adopted
some
other
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
you
mean
by
having
control
over
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
so
all
you're
requiring
is
knowledge
that
using
this
means
will
--
will
result
in
a
spill.
i
don't
think
knowledge
alone
is
enough
for
--
i
think
you
need
purpose.
if
you
arrange
for
disposal,
i
think
you
have
to
have
a
purpose.
it
--
it
has
to
be
your
object
to
have
the
oil
leaking
along
the
highway
as
you
go.
merely
knowing
that
it's
going
to
be
leaking
--
i
mean,
there
may
be
some
other
way
under
the
statute
that
you
could
find
liability
on
the
part
of
the
shipper,
but
not,
it
seems
to
me,
on
the
--
on
the
ground
that
the
shipper
arranged
for
this
leak.
he
didn't
want
the
leak.
he
knew
it
was
happening,
but
that
was
not
the
object
of
the
transport.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
finding?
do
we
have
to
take
it
as
a
given
that
this
was
an
indivisible
harm?
