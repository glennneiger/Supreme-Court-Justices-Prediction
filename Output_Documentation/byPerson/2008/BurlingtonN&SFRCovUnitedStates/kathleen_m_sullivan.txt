ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
untethered
cercla
liability
for
response
costs
from
the
plain
statutory
language
of
cercla
section
107(a)(
3),
and
in
so
doing
also
imposed
potentially
crippling
liability
on
entities
with
only
the
most
attenuated
connection
to
any
harm.
107(a)(
3),
which
was
reprinted
in
the
petition
appendix
in
1607
on
page
266a,
provides
that
among
the
potentially
responsible
parties
under
cercla
are
so-called
arrangers;
that
is,
those
persons
who
by
contract,
agreement,
or
otherwise
arranged
for
disposal
of
hazardous
substances.
the
paradigmatic
case,
of
course,
would
be
a
generator
of
hazardous
waste
calls
up
co.>
["]
and
asks
waste
co.
to
take
those
substances
to
a
landfill
or
to
otherwise
dispose
of
them.
where
cercla
does
not
define
a
statutory
term
--
and
there's
no
definition
of
"arrange"
--
this
court
has
long
said,
for
example
in
united
states
against
bestfoods,
that
we
look
to
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
language,
and
the
plain
meaning,
the
ordinary
meaning,
of
"arrange
for"
is
to
make
plans
or
preparations
to
do
something.
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
"for"
is
to
refer
to
a
purpose
or
goal.
and
the
ordinary
meaning
of
"to
dispose"
is
to
discard
or
to
throw
away.
so--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--no,
your
honor.
that's
not
our
facts,
of
course,
but
even
if
there
--
there
had
been
knowledge
here,
knowledge
is
not
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
the
specific
intent
required
by
the
statute.
just
as
in
the
criminal
law,
we
wouldn't
infer
in
a
specific
intent
case
that
one
is
presumed
to
know
the
natural
consequences
of
one's
acts.
what
is
required
here
is
an
actual
plan
to
dispose.
and--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
kennedy,
shell
might
well
be
liable
there,
but
not
under
107(a)(
3),
rather
under
107(a)(
2),
which
provides--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--you
wouldn't
reach
arranger
liability
there,
your
honor,
because
as
in
the
amcast
case,
when
judge
posner
said
the
truck
is
a
facility,
the
truck
would
be
a
facility
that
shell
owns
or
operates
in
that
instance.
but
in
this
case,
of
course,
shell
was
hiring
independent
contractor
truckers
to
ship
the
waste.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
well,
your
honor,
we
believe,
under
arranger
liability,
shell
would
never
be
an
arranger
here.
the
only
thing--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
justice
souter,
if
shell
had
residual
waste
product
that
it
was
seeking
to
dispose,
then
the
natural
reading
of
107(a)(
3)
would
apply
because
that
would
be
waste
product--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--your
honor--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--your
honor,
the
key
difference
in
the
two
hypotheticals
that
you've
posed
is
that
shell
is
the
owner
and
operator
of
the
disposal
of
waste
there,
and
therefore
it
would
be
a
107(a)(
2)
case,
not
an
arranger
case.
the
arranger
liability
is
designed
for--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that
would
be
a
different
case.
that
would
be
a
case
like
the
so-called
formulator
cases,
of
which
united
states
against
aceto
from
the
8th
circuit
is
paradigmatic.
and
in
that
case
the
key
is
that
the
company
arranging
--
the
company
was
held
liable
for
arranging
to
dispose
of
waste
where
it
owned
the
product
throughout
a
manufacturing
process,
sent
it
out
to
a
formulator,
but
got
it
back
as
its
own
product,
knowing
that
inherent
in
the
formulation
process
was
the
creation
of
waste
material.
so
shell
would
have
been
the
owner
of
the
waste--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
ginsburg,
that
is
correct
with
respect
to
arranging
for
the
disposal
of
waste.
one
couldn't
evade
one's
responsibility
for
arranging
for
the
disposal
of
waste
products.
if
you're
shipping
sludge
or
discarded
materials
or
spent
battery
casings
or
waste
oil,
if
you're
shipping
waste
then
you
can't
get
out
of
your
obligations
by
simply
arranging
for
someone
else
to
collect
the
waste
fob
destination.
but
the
difference
here
is
that
this
is
not
a
waste
case.
this
is
a--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
kennedy,
it
only
matters
for
3
if
we
arrange
for
it
to
spill.
and
as
judge
posner
said
in
amcast,
no
one
arranges
for
an
accident
except
in
the--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--well,
justice
kennedy,
the
district
court
found
in
this
case
that
shell
had
knowledge
of
spills
at
the
site
of
the
bulk
unloading.
these
were
minute
spills,
only
80
gallons
--
80
gallons
a
year
out
of
123,000--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--or.07
percent.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
your
honor,
even
if
the
spills
are
waste,
the
key
for
arranger
liability,
the
key
for
arranger
liability
is
that
you
arrange
for
the
spills.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
your
honor,
the
statute,
cercla,
by
cross-reference
to
the
solid
waste
disposal
act,
does
include
spills
and
leaks
as
possible
waste,
and
the
natural
application
of
that
definition
would
be
to
spills
or
leaks
in
a
waste
disposal.
if
a
landfill
operator
spills
or
leaks
waste,
then
obviously
that's
waste.
but
even
if
you
treat
drips
of
a
useful
product
--
and
there's
no
dispute
here
that
the
d-d
shipped
to
the
agricultural
facility
was
a
useful
product,
shipped
for
commercial
use
for
application
in
the
fields.
even
if
you
view
it
as
a
spill
of
that
product
if
a
little
bit
falls
out
of
the
hose
upon
delivery
at
the
bulk
storage
tank,
it
does
not
entail
that
shell
was
an
arranger
for
the
disposal
of
hazardous
waste--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--or
that
shell
knew
about
it.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
if
shell--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--it
might
well
be
because
there
would
be
an
economic
benefit
to
shell
from
the
arrangement
for
shipment
in
the
leaky
truck.
that
would
be
quite
a
different
case
from
this
one.
there
was
no
economic
benefit
to
shell
from
the
leaks
here.
in
fact,
shell
did
everything
possible,
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
to
prevent
spills.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
believe
the--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
kennedy
and
justice
souter,
an
easy
way
to
hold
this
case
and
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
simply
to
hold
that
when
a
useful
product
is
spilled,
it
is
not
waste.
and
the
cross-reference
to
the
solid
waste
disposal
act
would
support
that
interpretation
because
in
42
u.s.c.
section
6903(
3),
congress
defined
"hazardous
waste"
as
that
material
which
is
discarded.
it
analogizes
it
to
sludge.
this
is
not
a
case
about
sludge
or
waste
material
or--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--correct,
your
honor.
but
the
--
so
even
if
you
don't
draw
the
line
simply
at
the
useful
product-waste
distinction,
we
still
do
not
qualify
as
an
arranger
under
107(a)(
3)
because
we
did
not
arrange
for
the
spill,
we
did
not
arrange
for
the
waste.
the
government
relies
on
facts
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
we
had
some
special
knowledge
or
special
responsibility,
and
of
course
the
government's
argument
that
mere
knowledge
of
a
third-party's
spills
would
create
arranger
liability
would
disrupt
commerce
across
a
range
of
industries.
it
would
mean
that
the
chlorine
company
is
liable
when
the
pool
supply
store
spills
a
few
drops
of
chlorine
and
the
place
becomes
a
facility.
it
would
mean
that
the
maker
of
perchloroethylene
is
liable
when
the
dry
cleaning
establishments
spill
dry
cleaning
fluid
near
the
dry
cleaning
machine--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--even
if
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
your
honor,
there's
no
suggestion
in
the
record
here
that
we're
in
justice
alito's
example.
the
district
court
found
that
spills
were--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--there
--
we
believe
there
would
not
be
because
spilling
a
useful
product
while
it's
being
delivered
should
not
count
as
waste.
but
even
if
you
treated
that
as
waste
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
or
even
if
you
treated
that
as
a
discard
of
a
hazardous
substance,
there
still
should
not
be
arranger
liability
based
on
mere
knowledge.
there
has
to
be
knowledge
of
a
third
party's
spills.
the
difference
from
justice
alito's
example
is
that
shell
there
would
be
invested
in
the
spillage
as
part
of
its
own
economic
transaction,
as
in
the
formulator
cases,
where
you
send
a
material
out
to
a
manufacturer
intending
for
it,
expecting
for
it
to
spill
in
the
process,
you
know
you're
going
to
get
98
percent
back.
that's
not
this
case.
shell
sought
here,
as
most
routine
commercial
sellers
and
shippers
do,
to
get
a
third-party
truck
to
take
all
of
the
stuff
to
b&b
and
have
it
used
for
its
commercial
application
as
pesticide
in
the
field.
it
was
--
there
was
no
built-in
here,
no
effort
to
build
in
here
any
benefit
for
shell
in
the
leaky
truck,
quite
distinguishing
justice
alito's
example.
now,
the
government
has
relied--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--your
honor,
this
is
the
first
and
only
case
in
the
nation
that
has
held
that
arranger
liability
applies
to
a
mere
sale
of
a
useful
product
because
a
third-party
purchaser,
after
acquiring
possession
and
control,
spilled
the
product.
so
there's
no
other
case
i
am
aware
of
in
which
it's
been
adjudicated
that
there
is
any
liability
under
these
facts.
but
the
key
distinction
here
is
that
even
if
you
don't
distinguish
between
the
useful
product
and
waste
and
even
if
you
go
with
justice
kennedy's
idea
that
spilling
a
useful
product
could
be
waste,
it
still
is
not
arranging
for
the
disposal
of
that
substance
unless
there's
an
intent
to
dispose.
here
shell
wanted
every
drop
of
d-d
to
be
safely
placed
in
the
bulk
storage
tank,
and
then--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--no,
we
are
not,
justice
stevens,
and
that's--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
stevens,
we
concede
that
if
there
is
a
waste
product
that
leaves
shell
and
shell
deliberately
arranges
for
a
leaky
carrier,
there
would
be
no
issue.
that
would
be
107(a)(
3).
even
if
--
and
we
concede
there
might
be
a
possible
case
in
which
shell
deliberately
chooses
to
send
a
useful
product
in
a
way
that
it
leaks.
it
puts
the
product
into
leaky
containers
when
it
leaves
the
shop.
then
there
might
be
some
case
in
which
you
might
attribute
knowledge,
infer
intent
from
knowledge.
but
this
is
not
that
case
because
here
the
transfer
to
the
third
party
--
the
transfer
to
the
third
party
occurs
at
tender
of
delivery
under
ordinary
ucc
principles.
the
--
the
transfer
to
the
--
to
the
third-party
purchaser
occurs,
and
that's
when
the
spillage
occurs.
all
third-party--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
ginsburg,
two
points:
the
manual
comes
out
only
in
1978,
and
a
shell
representative
visits
the
site
only
in
1979.
that
leaves
19
years
of
liability
unaccounted
for
on
that
theory.
but,
more
important,
it
would
be
terribly
impractical
and
terribly
perverse
in
relation
to
the
purposes
of
the
environmental
laws
that
congress
passed
to
penalize
a
manufacturer
for
telling
a
third-party
purchaser
how
to
handle
a
product
more
safely.
so
to
use
the
manual
issued
in
1978
or
the
inspection
in
1979
as
evidence
that
shell
knew
there
were
spills
and,
therefore,
was
an
arranger
would
be
perverse
in
relation
to
the
environmental
statutes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
yes,
justice
kennedy.
the
--
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
this
was
a
divisible
harm.
mr.
stewart
answered
justice
scalia's
question
incorrectly.
the
district
court
found
and
the
circuit
court
also
found
--
the
circuit
court's
finding
is
on
page
36a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
cert
appendix
--
that
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
harm
here
is
divisible;
that
is,
there
--
the
--
the
harm
here
is
capable
of
apportionment.
that
is
not
disputed
before
this
court.
what
is
disputed
is
whether
at
the
second
stage
of
analysis
the
railroads
and
shell
met
our
burden
--
and
we
agree
it
is
our
burden
under
restatement
principles
--
of
showing
the
--
the
quantum
of
division,
the
reasonable
basis
for
how
the
shares
were
allocated
by
the
district
court.
and
justice
alito
is
correct.
there
are
meticulous
findings,
20
pages
of
findings,
based
on
record
evidence
from
the
government's
witnesses
and
from
the
extensive
expert
testimony
that
both
shell
and
the
railroads
put
in
that
went
to
the
apportionment
issue.
shell
argued--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--it's
capable
of
apportionment.
the
restatement
suggests
in
the
cases
applying
this
--
it
said
you
ask
at
the
first
stage:
is
the
harm
capable
of
apportionment
as
a
matter
of
law?
and
then
as
a
matter
of--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--they
should
bear.
but
then
they
--
it's
up
to
the
parties
to
prove
a
reasonable
basis
for
apportionment.
but
both
shell
and
the
railroads
did
argue,
justice
ginsburg
--
put
into
evidence
and
argued
at
the
district
court
that
there
should
be
apportionment--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
district
court
here
was
conservative.
it
allocated
all
of
the
costs,
fixed
and
specific,
to
the
parties.
so
the
conservative
estimate
of
six
percent
for
shell,
nine
percent
for
the
railroads,
was
based
on
the
heroic
assumption
that
a
few
drops
spilled
two
football
fields
away
of
a
volatile
substance
that
evaporates
twice
as
fast
as
water
would
be
picked
up
by
rainfall
that
could
happen
at
the
relevant
quantities
only
once
every
ten
years
according
to
our
expert,
once
every
seven
years
according
to
the
government's
expert
--
on
the
heroic
assumption
that
all
of
those
drips
reached
the
pond
which
created
the
single
plume
of
contamination,
assuming
that,
then
we
award
six
percent
or
nine
percent
of
liability.
but
the
point
is
there
was
record
evidence,
justice
ginsburg
--
and
there's
no
need
for
a
remand
on
this.
there
was
ample
evidence
for
which
the
six
percent
and
the
nine
percent
could
be
--
we
--
and
we
didn't
--
to
say
we--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
ginsburg,
there's
no
question
that
both
the
railroads
and
shell
argued
for
zero
percent
liability.
but
the
same
evidence
that
we
put
in
and
the
proposed
findings
of
fact
--
for
example,
if
you
want
to
look
at
docket
nos.
1317
and
1318,
shell's
proposed
findings
of
fact
did
suggest
a
basis
for
apportionment.
so
we
met
our
burden
of
production
as
well
as
proof.
but
the
--
to
return
to
the
question--
ms.
kathleen
m.
sullivan
--justice
kennedy,
here
--
and
i
refer
you
to
the
petition
appendix
at
page
--
excuse
me,
to
the
joint
appendix
at
page
288,
to
the
expert
kalinowski
who
described
this
as
a
single
mass
removal
scheme.
this
is
not
a
case
like
a
toxic
soup
case
in
a
landfill
with
238
different
chemicals
that
require
different
extraction
procedures.
this
is
a
case
in
which
two
chemicals
reached
the
groundwater
and
were
to
be
removed
by
a
single
mass
extraction
scheme,
a
single
--
what
the
expert
called
--
at
joint
appendix
288
--
a
mass
removal
scheme.
it
was
not
disputed
or
argued
on
appeal
that
there
was
a
single
remediation
process.
so
this
is
a
simple
case
in
which
we
are
relying--

a
reasonable
basis
is
all
that's
required.
practical
approximation
is
appropriate
here.
here
the
court
did
not
distinguish
between
fixed
capital
costs
and
operating
costs
that
might
matter
in
a
different
case.
but
the
key
point
here
is
that
you
should
affirm
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
that
restatement
433a
provides
only
a
demand
for
a
reasonable
basis
and
not
exactitude.
thank
you
very
much.
