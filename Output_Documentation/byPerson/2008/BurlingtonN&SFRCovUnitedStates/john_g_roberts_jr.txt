chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
07-1601,
burlington
northern
and
santa
fe
railway
company
et
al.
v.
united
states.
ms.
sullivan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
your
shipper
here
knew
that
every
time
he
delivered
one
of
these
truckloads
of
the
chemical,
one-third
of
it
would
end
up
on
the
ground
and
seeping
through
the
ground,
and
no
doubt
about
it,
he
knew
that,
and
yet
they
kept
sending
it?
wouldn't
that
be
arranging
for
the
disposal
of
at
least
a
third
of
the
shipment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
--
your
argument
assumes
a
sharp
distinction
between
useful
product
and
waste.
yet
it's
quite
common
to
talk
about
there
being
waste
associated
with
a
useful
product.
when
you
use
up
so
much
of
this,
there's
going
to
be
a
certain
percentage
of
waste.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
making
it
too
easy
for
you.
it
would
mean
all
of
those
people
would
be
liable
when
in
the
course
of
delivering
stuff
they
know
there's
going
to
be
a
certain
amount
that's
going
to
spill,
and
even
--
perhaps
the
justice
alito's
hypothetical
--
they
could
have
easily
--
they
chose
the
truck
that
causes
more
spill
rather
than
the
one
that
causes
less.
it's
not
simply
here's
the
product,
we're
gone,
see
you
later,
and
all
of
a
sudden
there's
a
spill.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
i
know.
but
i'm
trying
to
reach
the
extent
of
your
argument.
so
in
that
type
of
a
case
would
there
be
arranger
liability?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
mahoney.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
what
if
you
have
a
situation
where
it's
clear
under
apportionment
one
party
is
liable
for
one-tenth
and
the
other
is
liable
for
nine-tenths,
but
one-tenth
is
enough
to
pollute
the
--
the
water.
do
you
have
apportionment
in
that
situation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
assume
it's
not
a
linear,
if
that's
the
right
word,
progression,
because
once
you've
got
to
start
a
clean-up,
you've
got
to
start
a
clean-up,
whether
it's,
you
know,
caused
by
one-tenth
or
--
or
nine-tenths.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
about
the
issue
of
insolvency?
you
have
talked
about
the
restatements.
there's
the
comment
h
to
one
of
the
restatement
provisions
that
says
you
don't
apportion
if
one
of
the
other
parties
is
insolvent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
the
question
of
apportionment,
is
it
really
your
position
that
because
of
the
precision
you
would
require,
that
if
there's
a
big
fight
over
whether
it's
10
percent
responsibility
or
30
percent
and
there's
no
way
to
tell,
that
if
the
parties
said,
look,
we'll
take
40
percent,
that
that's
no
good?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
what
happened
here?
i
mean,
whatever
--
i
guess
the
railroads
said
6
percent,
and
the
district
court
said,
well,
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side,
we'll
give
them
9
percent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
still
doesn't
address
the
question,
if
you
have
varying
degrees
of
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
--
fault
or
causal
relationship
--
that
that's
a
sensible
way
to
apportion
the
liability.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
about
ms.
mahoney's
three
answers,
when
i
asked
that
question
of
her?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
she
also
said
that
the
restatement
comment
h
that
you
rely
on
cites
no
cases,
and
the
third
restatement
backs
away
from
that
comment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
don't
--
you
don't
think
that
the
insolvency
should
prevent
apportionment
if
you
have
a
situation
where
a
party
is
1
percent
responsible
and
the
99
percent
responsible
party
is
insolvent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
what
do
we
have
in
the
way
of
findings
on
that
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
is
that
right?
i
mean,
doesn't
it
--
aren't
you
challenging
the
whole
basis
for
apportionment?
i
mean
--
i
don't
think
when
you're
apportioning
responsibility,
you
allocate
whether
or
not
the
actors
independently
caused
the
harm.
i
thought
the
assumption
was,
yes,
everybody's
--
all
of
this
group
has
contributed
to
the
harm,
but
now
we're
going
to
apportion
their
responsibility.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
sullivan,
we
will
give
you
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
know
what
it
means
to
say
it's
a
divisible
harm.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
means
that
whatever
percentage
of
responsibility
the
parties
have,
that's
the
percentage
of
cost
that
they--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
does
that
mean
that,
let's
say,
the
--
how
does
that
work
when
it
costs
$2
million
to
sort
of
start
a
clean-up,
no
matter
who,
and
then,
you
know,
the
more
stuff
there
is,
the
extra
million
it
is?
is
that
--
is
--
is
the
initial
cost
a
divisible
harm?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
today
in
07-1601,
burlington
northern
&
santa
fe
railway
versus
the
united
states.
