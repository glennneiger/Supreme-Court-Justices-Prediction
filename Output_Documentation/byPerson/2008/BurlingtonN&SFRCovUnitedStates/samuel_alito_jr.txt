justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--had
the
choice
between
two
companies
to
do
the
shipping,
and
one
would
deliver
it
with
no
spillage
whatsoever,
but
the
other
would
deliver
it
with
a
certain
amount,
a
small
amount
of
spillage?
and
shell
chose
the
latter
because
it
was
cheaper.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
it
not
be
arranging
under
those
circumstances?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
argument
that
the
petitioners
waived
their
apportionment
argument?
aren't
there
many
pages
of
the
district
court
record
in
which
the
parties
address
apportionment?
for
example,
in
the
government's
response
to
the
petitioners'
apportionment
argument,
don't
you
have
more
than
20
pages
of
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
on
the
issue
of
apportionment?

do
you
dispute
what
ms.
mahoney
said,
that
it
costs
a
great
deal
more
to
clean
up
some
of
the
other
chemicals
than
the
ones
that
the
railroad
was
responsible
for?

the

volume
of
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

--what's
the
basis
for
thinking
that
every
little
detail
in
the
latest
restatement,
including
comments,
is
binding
in
a
cercla
case?
