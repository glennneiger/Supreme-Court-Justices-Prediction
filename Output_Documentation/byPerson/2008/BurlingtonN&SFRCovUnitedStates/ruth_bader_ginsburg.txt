so,
ms.
sullivan,
would
it
be
altogether
different
if,
instead
of
the
fob
destination>
["]
term,
shell
continued
as
owner
of
the
product
until
it
had
gone
from
--
from
the
hose
or
whatever
delivers
it,
so
that
there
is
no
transfer
of
ownership
until
the
delivery
is
complete?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
problem
i
have
with
that
line
you're
pursuing
is
the
fob
destination>
["]
term
is
an
eminently
fixable
connection,
and
cercla
is
--
can
be
a
punishing
statute,
but
the
one
thing
that
was
not
intended
was
for
the
party
to
arrange
themselves
out
of
arranger
liability
by
providing
neatly
that
the
moment
the
product
reaches
a
destination
there's
no
continuing
responsibility
on
the
part
of
the
seller.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
one
--
one
benefit
would
be
avoiding
cercla
liability
through
a
means
other
than
what
i
call
a
fixable
connection.
is
this
the
first
occasion
on
which
shell,
because
of
its
sales
of
d-d,
has
been
charged
with
cercla
liability?
is
this
a
case
of
first
impression,
or
have
there
been
other
instances
in
which
shell
did
very
much
the
same
thing,
delivered
the
d-d
fob
destination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there
was
as
part
of
this
picture
that
shell
had
a
manual
which
told
its
purchasers
how
to
handle
this
material,
and
that
shell
was
well
aware
that
b&b
was
not
following
the
precautions
laid
out
in
the
manual.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
court
--
this
court,
ms.
mahoney,
didn't
deny
apportionment.
apportionment
was
never
requested.
the
court
said:
"i'm
going
to
have
to
figure
this
out
on
my
own.
"
in
fact,
the
court
deplored
the
parties
for
following
what
he
called
a
"scorched-earth
tactic".
so
the
apportionment
is
not
something
that
has
been
denied
to
the
prps
in
this
case.
it's
something
that
the
court
thought
was
proper
and
fair,
but
it
didn't
deny
any
request
made
by
parties,
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
point
to
me
the
part
of
the
district
court
opinion
that
conflicts
with
the
part
that
i
remember
so
well?
he
is
saying,
this
is
a
really
tough
assignment;
i
have
to
figure
it
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
--
is
it
a
judge's
responsibility,
no
matter
what
evidence
may
be
in
the
record
from
which
one
could
make
a
finding,
when
a
finding
hasn't
been
sought?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
hasn't
been
--
that
hasn't
been
the
position
of
most
courts
under
cercla.
i
thought
they
--
i
thought
that
there
had
been
relatively
few
cases
where
apportionment,
when
requested,
was
even
allowed
because
the
theory
is
the
act
provides
for
contribution.
one
prp
can
go
after
another,
but
the
party
who
shouldn't
be
left
holding
the
bag
is
the
public,
the
innocent
victims
of
the
pollution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
--
i
thought
--
and
tell
me
if
my
recollection
of
the
facts
is
incorrect
--
that
the
--
the
newer
parcel
that
enabled
b&b
to
expand
its
operation,
the
waste
went
into
a
pond,
what
was
called
south,
that
was
on
the
other
side,
that
was
on
the
original
b&b
parcel.
so
you
had
the
waste
flowing
from
one
part
to
the
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
--
may
i
just
ask
one
question
about
the
--
the
situation
of
--
of
these
two
potentially
responsible
parties?
they
are
the
only
ones
left,
right?
because
b&b
is
bankrupt,
and
there's
nobody
else
that
has
been
identified.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
only
those
two.
and
one
question
about
the
arranger
liability
--
well,
first
on
the
apportionment.
assuming
we
don't
accept
your
entire
position,
would
a
remand
so
that
proof
could
be
put
in
by
both
sides
focusing
on
the
issue
of
apportionment
be
appropriate?
you
questioned
the
district,
even
--
even
if
apportionment
were
possible,
you
questioned
how
he
arrived
at
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is
it
true,
as
ms.
sullivan
said,
that
there
is
no
other
arranger
case
like
this
one
where
the,
quote,
"arranger"
is
the
seller
of
a
product?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not
normally
how
--
when
--
when
someone
has
a
burden
of
proof,
it's
a
burden
of
coming
forward.
and
the
one
thing
that
we
do
know
from
this
district
judge
is
he's
saying,
i
was
left
largely
to
make
it
up.
what
he
--
the
components
of
his
allocation
did
not
come
from
--
yes,
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record.
but
ordinarily
when
you
talk
about
a
party
who
has
a
burden
of
proof,
we
don't
mean
they
put
in
a
piece
here
and
a
piece
there
and
left
it
to
the
district
judge
to
figure
out.
