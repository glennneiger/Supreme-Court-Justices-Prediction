what
if
shell
went
out
of
business
and
it
had
some
stuff
left
in
the
tanks?
at
that
point,
they
might
very
well
hire
somebody
to
do
exactly
what
you're
saying--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
would
be
an
eccentric
situation,
but
it
could
happen.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
your
definition
of
--
of
"disposal"
implied
the
disposition
of
something
whose
use
had,
in
effect,
been
exhausted,
so
that
i
would
have
thought
your
answer
to
justice
alito's
question
would
have
been
different
because
even
in
the
case
in
which
they
hired
a
sloppy
delivery,
they're
not
getting
rid
of
--
or
the
deliverer
is
not
necessarily
getting
rid
of
a
product
whose
use
has
been
exhausted.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
dependent
on
the
question
of
control?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
do
we
--
i
mean,
do
we
have
control?
shell
says
to
its
buyer,
see
that
the
delivery
is
made
in
the
following
way,
so
it
doesn't
spill
all
over
the
place.
if
shell
had
control,
it
wouldn't
have
to
say
that
to
the
buyer.
in
effect,
it
could
either
order
the
buyer,
as
a
condition
of
receipt
of
the
product,
or
it
could
require
that
as
part
of
the
--
its
terms
with
the
--
with
the
deliverer.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
way
shell
has
set
it
up
indicates
that
control
has
passed
to
somebody
else
at
the
moment
that
the
spigot
starts
going
in
the
tank.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
says,
we
won't
sell
you
to
unless
you
--
you
--
you
have
these
tanks,
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
what
is
your
--
i
mean,
those
--
no
question,
those
are
--
those
are
terms
of
their
willingness
to
deal.
but
what
is
your
basis
for
saying
that
when
the
truck
pulls
up
and
they
--
the
hose
is
turned
on
to
deliver,
that
at
that
point
shell
is
controlling
the
process?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
don't
--
maybe
you
do
claim,
i'm
not
sure
of
this
--
that
shell
actually
could,
in
effect,
get
damages
from
its
deliverer
as
a
result
of
the
--
the
deliverer's
incidental
spillage.
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
that
the
spillage
is
a
breach
of
the
contract
between
the
transporter
and
shell?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
do
you
have
any
basis
for
saying
that
if
it
had
pursued
that
course
of
action,
it
would
have
--
shell
would
have
succeeded?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
--
then
why
is
shell
in
control?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
but
you're
saying
that
the
delivery
company
would
have
had
a
defense,
but
you
are
--
are
saying
that
shell
would
have
had
at
least
a
theoretical
right
under
its
actual
contract
with
the
deliverer
to
assert
the
--
the
control
over
the
manner
of
delivery
that
would
have
prevented
the
spill;
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
--
that's
the
only
way
they
could
do
it
if
the
buyer
did
have
bulk
storage,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
stewart,
could
i
go
back
to
a
--
we
have
been
arguing
about
details.
can
i
go
back
to
the
--
to
the
broader
question?
what
is
your
best
response
to
the
argument
that
ms.
sullivan
makes
that
"arrange
for
disposal"
implies
something
significantly
different
from
"arrange
for
transfer",
"arrange
for
release",
"arrange
for
delivery"
--
that
the
--
that
the
combination
of
arrangement
as
an
intentional
act
and
disposal,
as
opposed
to
one
of
these
--
these
other
processes,
implies
that
the
--
in
effect,
the
use
of
the
product
intended
has
become
exhausted
and
that
one
in
getting
rid
of
waste
as
distinct
from
merely
wasting
something.
what
is
--
what
is
your
best
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
we're
not
arguing
about
that,
what
you
are
arguing
about,
then,
is
the
--
is
the
implication
of
disposal,
as
opposed
to
a
more
neutral
term
like
"transfer"
or
"delivery"
or
what-not.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
but
those
are
certainly
ways
in
which
disposal
can
occur,
as
i
--
i
think
came
out
in
the
argument.
if
the
--
if
waste
management
spills
things
along
the
highway
on
the
way
to
the
dump,
it
may
be
leakage,
but
a
disposal
is
going
on
because
in
fact
it
is
a
way
of
getting
rid
of
something
that
no
longer
has
any
use.
so
i
--
i
can
--
i
don't
think
the
--
the
inclusion
of
leakage
within
the
definition
answers
the
question
whether
disposal
is
something
different
from
transfer.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
have
discharged,
but
you
--
the
question
is
whether
it
is
disposal.
justice
david
h.
souter
"discharge"
is
a
more
neutral
term.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
that
--
that
--
that
begs
the
question.
because
in
the
course
of
disposing,
in
the
sense
that
she
argues
for,
there
can
be
leakage.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
question
is
"disposal"
versus
"transfer"
or
some
more
neutral
term.
justice
david
h.
souter
when?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
--
in
that
case,
you
have
knowledge,
but
you
don't
have
control
because
you're
using
a
common
carrier.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
you
mean
simply
control
over
your
own
choice
process?
justice
david
h.
souter
not
control
over
the
behavior
of
your
hauler?
