mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
could
begin
with
the
issue
of
arranger
liability.
the
ninth
circuit
distinguished
what
it
referred
to
as
the
"useful
product"
cases
and
made
it
clear
that
it
would
not
impose
arranger
liability
on
shell
simply
under
the
theory
that
shell
had
sold
a
useful
product
that
was
later
disposed
of
in
a
way
that
contaminated
the
environment.
rather,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
emphasized
both
that
shell
had
control
over
the
delivery
process
and
that
shell
knew
that,
as
the
district
court
put
it,
"leaks
and
spills
were
inherent
in
the
chosen
method.
"
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
i
don't
think
they
would--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
think
they
would
be
arrangers
for
the
disposal.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
because
even
though
they
might
foresee
that
in
some--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
i
--
but
first,
i
think
under
ordinary
tort
law
principles
a
seller's
knowledge
that
a
certain
percentage
of
its
products
would
be
misused
would
not
be
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
liability--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there
are
two
differences.
the
first
is
that
while
hp
might
know
that
some
percentage
of
its
customers
would
dispose
of
the
material
improperly,
here
the
district
court
found
that
shell
knew
that
spills
and
leaks
occurred
with
every
delivery.
and
the
second--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
second
difference
here
is
that
shell
arranged
for
the
delivery
and
controlled
the
circumstances
under
which
the
delivery
would
be
made.
that
is,
shell
hired
the
common
carrier
and
shell
required
that
b&b
have
bulk
storage
facilities
so
that
the
d-d
would
have
to
be
pumped
from
the
delivery
truck
into
the
bulk
storage.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--again,
at
a
certain
point,
once
the
product
has
been
used
by
the
customer--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
no--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--because
the
fact
circumstance
here
was
not
that
shell
or
the
common
carrier
transferred
control
of
the
d-d
to
b&b
with
instructions
as
to
how
it
was
to
be
used
at
a
later
date,
and
the
customer
then
violated
those
instructions.
the
fact
pattern
here
is
that
the
spills
occurred
during
the
process
of
delivery.
and
to
return
to
justice
alito's
hypothetical,
you
asked
what
if
shell
deliberately
chose
a
particular
delivery
company
that
it
knew
would
result
in
spills,
but
did
so
for
economic
advantage,
that's
exactly
the
case
here.
that
is,
at
a
prior
time
the
d-d
had
been
shipped
to
b&b's
facility
in
sealed
drums,
so
whatever
the
possibility
that
it
might
be
misused
later,
it
wouldn't
be
spilled
or
leaked
during
the
process
of
delivery
and
transfer.
but
shell
decided
that
it
was
to
its
economic
advantage
to
require
bulk
storage
of
d-d
so
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
district
court
specifically
declined
to
make
a
finding
there.
that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
says
fob
delivery>
["]
or
place
of
delivery.
and
the
district
court
found
that
b&b
acquired
what
it
called
"stewardship"
over
the
property
at
the
time
that
the
truck
entered
the
premises,
but
that
it
was--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
the
district
court--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
district
court
specifically
declined
to
find
--
to
make
a
finding
as
to
who
owned
the
d-d
at
the
time
it
was
spilled.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
don't
think
that
our
argument
is
dependent
upon
the
question
of
ownership,
because
shell
undeniably
had
ownership
and
possession
of
the
d-d
at
the
time
the
arrangement
was
made,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
but
that
would
be
true
in
the
paradigmatic
arranger
case,
where
one
company
has
generated
waste
and
hires
a
hauler
to
pick
it
up
and
take
it
away.
those
parties
could
easily
provide
by
contract
that
title
would
pass
to
the
hauler
at
the
time
the
garbage--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
more
than--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--knowledge
might
well
be
sufficient,
but
here
we
have
more
than
knowledge;
we
have
control.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
as
ms.
sullivan
said,
the
instructions
were
given
in
1978,
fairly
far
into
the
period
of
contamination.
but
even
before
that
date
shell
had
control
in
the
sense
that
it
required
bulk
storage
on
the
b&b
facility--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
its
contract
with
the
common
carrier
required
that
the
common
carrier
have
particular
equipment
for
pumping
the
d-d
out
of
the
truck
and
into
the
bulk
storage
facility.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
they
have
--
they
have
control
of
the
process
in
the
sense
of
defining
the
way
it
is
to
be
done.
you're
correct
that
the
actual
process
of
unloading
is
being
done
by
employees
of
the
common
carrier
and
employees
of
b&b
rather
than
employees
of
shell.
but
again,
the
whole
point
of
arranger
liability
is
to
not
allow
the
people
who
set
in
motion
the
process
that
culminates
in
disposal
to
get
off
the
hook
because
they're--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
if
--
if
shell
had
pursued
such
a
cause
of
action,
then
the
delivery
company
might
well
have
argued
that
these
--
this
was
foreseeable
and
that
there
was--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
that's
my
point.
shell
would
not
have
succeeded
in
such
a
suit,
because
the
delivery
company
would
have
argued
successfully
this
was
known
to
be
an
inherent
consequence
of
the
delivery
process
that
shell
has
chosen.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
it
certainly
insisted
by
contract
on
the
use
of
the
pumping
equipment
of
--
to
pump
the
d-d
from
the
truck
into
the
bulk
storage
facility.
and
that
was--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and
so
--
to
use
an
analogy--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
not
essential
to
our
theory.
that
is,
the
point
of
the
arranger
liability
provision
is
to
get
at
situations
in
which
one
person
sets
in
motion
a--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
guess
i
would
have
to
know
more
about
the
hypothetical
in
--
as
to
the
circumstances
in
which
the
disposal
occurred.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
guess
i
just
--
i
don't
really
understand
the
hypothetical,
because
i
don't
understand
the
situation
in
which
shell
would
be
indifferent
as
to
whether
its
product
was
being
bought
or
the
product
of
a
competitor
was
being
bought.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
agree
that
the
term
"arrange
for"
connotes
intentionality,
and
we
think
it's
satisfied
here
because
shell
intentionally
set
in
motion
the
process
of
delivery.
it
insisted
upon
the
delivery
being
done
in
a
particular
fashion,
and
it
knew
that
spills
and
leaks
were
inherent
in
that
process.
to
use
an
analogy--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
further
point
i
would
make
is
that
the
term
"disposal"
is
specifically
defined
to
include
spilling
and
leaking.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
to
use
a
couple
of
analogies,
i
think
if
i
know
that
my
car
leaks
oil
whenever
it's
operated
and
i
choose
to
drive
it
on
the
public
highway,
i
think
i
could
naturally
be
said
to
have
intentionally
discharged
oil
onto
the
highway.
it
may
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
again,
the
term
"disposal"
is
specifically
defined
to
include
spilling
and
leaking.
you're
right
that
one--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
true,
but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if
you
had
a
situation
where
--
for
instance,
where
the
trash
company
was
hauling
waste
and
intended
to
dispose
of
it
in
a
more
classic
sense
by
dumping
it
at
a
landfill,
but
along
the
way
the
truck
leaked,
and
some
of
the
items
spilled
out--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
everybody
acknowledges
that
there
is
disposal
there,
and
i
think
we
would
also
say
that
a
company
that
contracted
with
that
trash
hauler,
knowing
that
the
vehicle
tended
to
leak
trash
on
--
on
every
delivery,
could
be
said
to
have
arranged
for--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--not
only
the
ultimate
disposal,
but
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
am
following
that,
but
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
this
and
said:
our
holding
does
not
suggest
that
every
manufacturer
of
a
useful
product
is
liable
down
the
road
if
the
customer
ultimately
disposes
of
it--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think
in
a
sense
the
argument
for
liability
there
would
depend
in
part
on
an
assumption
that
people
will
systematically
violate
the
law,
like
it
would
be
an
easy
thing
for
the
court
to
say
we
will
not
assume
and
we
will
not
impose
liability
on
the
basis
of
the
assumption
that
battery
customers
will
systematically
violate
the
law.
but
the
second
thing
that
would
be
missing
in
that
hypothetical,
even
if
the
battery
manufacturer
were
assumed
to
know
that
every
one
of
his
customers
would
dispose
of
them
ultimately
in
an
improper
way,
is
that
the
battery
manufacturer
would
not
be
in
control
of
that
process.
the
manufacturer's
control
over
the
use
of
the
batteries
and
their
ultimate
disposal
would
be
severed
once
he
turned
them
over,
and
that
was
not
the
case
here.
and
again
i
think
to
return
to
the
purposes
of
the
arranger
liability
provision,
the
operator
liability
provision
deals
very
well
with
the
people
who
undertake
the
actual
disposal,
but
congress
evidently
thought
that
that
was
not
enough.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
it
is
a
combination
of
knowledge
and
control.
knowledge
might
be
sufficient,
but
knowledge
and
control
together
form
a
basis
for
arranger
liability.
again,
if
i
know
that
a
particular
common
carrier
uses
a
truck
--
to
use
a
variant
of
my
earlier
hypothetical,
if
i
know
that
a
particular
common
carrier
uses
a
truck
that
leaks
oil
whenever
it's
operated
on
the
highway
and
i
contract
with
that
carrier
and
ask
it
to
haul
goods,
i
think
i
can
naturally
be
said
to
have
arranged
for
the
discharge
of
oil
on--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
have
--
i
have
control
in
the
sense
that
i
have
deliberately
selected
a
mode
of
delivery,
a
particular
common--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--not
--
not
control
in
the
sense
of
using
my
own
personnel
to
drive
the
truck.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
again,
because
here
shell
had
control
over
the
very
aspect
of
the
process
that
resulted
in
spills
and
leaks.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
not
only
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
not
only
that
it
could
have
adopted
some
other
means,
but
that
it
insisted
upon
the
particular
means--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--clearly,
if
the
court
reads
the
term
"arrange
for"
to
require
purpose,
we
lose
in
this
case--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--because
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
transaction.
but
here
there
was
both
knowledge
and
control.
and
in
terms
of
fairness
to
shell,
i
think
it
is
worth
noting
that
in
the
typical
arranger
setting,
where
a
person
asks
a
trash
hauler
to
come
pick
up
my
trash
and
deposit
it
in
an
appropriate
place,
that
the
arranger's
ultimate
liability
may
be
determined
very
substantially
by
steps
that
the
hauler
takes
afterwards;
that
is,
if
the
arranger
believes
that
the
trash
is
going
to
be
disposed
of
safely,
but
in
fact
the
hauler
dumps
it
in
a
way
that
will
contaminate
the
environment,
the
arranger
was--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
haven't
used
the
word
"waiver"
in
our
brief
and
--
but
we
concede
that
the
railroads
and
shell,
at
least
in
a
cursory
way,
raised
the
issue
of
apportionment
at
trial,
and
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
was
sufficient
to
preserve
it.
in
our
view,
this
is
like
any
case
in
which
a
party
with
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
particular
issue
asserts
that
a
particular
proposition
is
true
but
fails
to
introduce
sufficient
evidence
to
carry
its
burden.
you
wouldn't
speak
of
that
as
waiver,
but
it's
still
a
failure
of
the
party
to
come
forward
with
enough
to
carry
the
day.
and
you--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
i
think
that
would
be
an
acceptable
approach.
i
think
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
guess
we
would
have
two
responses.
the
first
is,
although
the
district
court
certainly
believed
that
he
was
--
the
district
judge
believed
he
was
building
in
a
margin
of
safety,
in
our
view
it's
still
speculative
as
to
whether
the
railroads'
share
of
the
contamination
exceeded
or
was
less
than
9
percent.
but
the
more
fundamental
point
is
the
one
that
you
raised
in
one
of
your
questions;
that
is,
the
ultimate
harm
to
the
government
in
a
practical
sense
is
the
incurrence
of
response
costs,
and
in
general
that's
the
way
that
damages
are
measured
in
a
cercla
case.
you
don't
ask,
what
threat
--
what
was
the
degree
of
public
--
of
threat
to
the
public
safety
that
was
posed
by
the
contamination?
you
ask,
how
much
did
it
cost
to
clean
it
up?
and
it--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
--
i
don't
think
that
the
record
kind
of
establishes
the
relative
costs
of
different
contaminants.
what
i
understood
ms.
mahoney
to
say--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--what
i
understood
her
to
say
was
that
the
cost
of
the
remedial
action
is
proportional
to
the
mass
of
chemicals
to
be
removed,
and
we
do
dispute
that
proposition.
the
railroads'
expert,
dr.
kalinowski,
testified
about
the
remedial
action
that
the
government
at
that
time
was
contemplating,
and
it
was
what
was
referred
to
as
gac,
and
that
was
a
method
of
removing
the
contaminants
so
that
the
water
could
be
pumped
back
in.
and
dr.
kalinowski
said
that
the
amount
of
gac
that
would
be
needed
to
implement
that
remedy
would
be
proportional
to
the
mass
of
the
chemicals
involved,
but
that
the
crucial
point
for
these
purposes
is
the
treatment
with
gac
is
only
a
small
portion
of
the
pump-and-treat
remedy;
that
is,
it's
essential
to
drill
wells,
pump
the
water
out,
then
treat
it,
and
then
under
the
prior
remedial
approach,
pump
it
back
in.
and
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
first
preliminary
point
is
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
cost
of
the
remedy
as
a
whole
would
be
proportional
to
the
mass
of
the
contaminants
because
you
have
very
substantial
fixed
costs,
but
the
other
point
i
would
make
is
this
is
where
the
insolvency
of
b&b
really
seems
to
us
to
become
crucial
because,
if
you
had
all
solvent
defendants
and
the
evidence
showed
that
the
remedy
the
government
implemented
would
have
been
more
or
less
the
same
if
it
had
only
been
10
percent
of
the
contamination,
30
percent
of
the
contamination,
or
100
percent
of
the
contamination,
that
so
much
of
the
costs
were
fixed
costs
that
reducing
the
volume
was
really
not
going
to
affect
the
cost
in
any
meaningful
way
--
if
you
had
all
solvent
defendants,
it
might
still
be
the
case
that
dividing
the
costs
up
in
proportion
to
the
contamination
they
caused
would
do
rough
justice.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
believe
her
first
answer
was
the
cost
of
the
remedy
would
be
proportional
to
the
amount
of
contamination,
which
we
disagree
with,
and
we
don't
think
dr.
kalinowski's
testimony
bears
that
out,
because
all
he
said
was
the
amount
of
granular-activated
carbon
that
would
be
necessary
is
proportional
to
the
mass
of
contaminants.
and
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
as
to
the
first
point,
the
comment
h,
you're
right,
doesn't
cite
cases,
and
it
does
say
that
this
--
the
insolvency
of
the
defendant
need
not
prevent
apportionment,
only
that
it
would
provide
a
basis
for
doing
so
in
exceptional
cases.
but
in
our
view,
the
exceptional
case
would
be
one
in
which
the
ultimate
determination
was
that
the
cost
of
the
remedy,
the
amount
of
the
relevant
harm,
would
be
more
or
less
the
same
even
if
only
one
defendant's
contamination
were
at
issue,
that
it--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
we
would
say
even
as
to
10
or
20
percent,
if
it
were
established
that
the
remedy
the
government
would
have
been
required
to
implement,
had
the
only
source
of
contamination
been
leakage
on
the
railroad
parcel
--
if
it
were
established
that
the
government
could
have
cleaned
that
up
at
10
percent
or
20
percent
of
the
cost
of
the
remedy
that
was
actually
chosen,
then
there
might
be
a
sound
basis
for
apportionment
despite
the
insolvency
of
b&b.
but
our
big
point
is,
at
the
very
least,
the
government
should
not
be
left
holding
the
bag
for
costs
that
it
would
have
been
required
to
incur
if
the
railroad
parcel
had
been
the
only
source
of
contamination,
because--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
don't
have
findings
either
way.
that
is,
the
district
court
framed
the
relevant
inquiry
as
what
percentage
of
the
contamination
was
attributable
to
the
railroad
parcel,
to
the
shell-controlled
deliveries,
and
to
the
b&b
parcel.
but
it
made
no
finding
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
what
the
cost
of
the
remedy
would
have
been
if
only
the
--
if
the
only
source
of
contamination
had
been
the
railroad
parcel.
and
certainly
the
--
the
primary
equitable
thrust
of
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
it's
unfair
to
make
us
pay
for
somebody
else's
contamination.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
government
would
have
been
required
to
implement
a
remedy
this
costly
or
even
60
percent
this
costly,
had
the
railroads
or
shell
been
the
only
source
of
contamination,
by
imposing
at
least
that
amount
of
liability,
we're
not
asking
for
them
to
pay
for
b&b's
contamination.
we're
simply
asking
for
them
to
pay
for
the
response
costs
that
their
own--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
indeed,
the
second
restatement
says
as
a
categorical
matter
that
if
either
of
two
causes
would
have
been
independently
sufficient
to
bring
about
the
result,
then
there's
joint
and
several
liability.
the
example
that
the
restatement
gives
is
two
merging
fires
that
destroyed
a
building.
and
so
i
think
it
is
established
in
--
in
the
second
restatement
that
the
--
there
is
no
apportionment
if
either
of
two
causes
would
have
brought
about
the
--
the
feared
harm.
with
--
with
respect
to
the
third
restatement,
i
would
say
that
at
least
in
the
case
of
--
you're
--
you're
right.
there
is
no
exact
counterpart
to
comment
h
in
the
third
restatement.
but
at
least
as
to
indivisible
harms
--
and
i
think
this
is
potentially
an
indivisible
harm
that
the
government
would
have
been
required
to
undertake
more
or
less
the
same
response
action
regardless
of
the
source
of
contamination.
at
least
as
to
individual
harms,
the
third
restatement
gives
a
variety
of
approaches
that
a
local
jurisdiction
could
take.
there's
joint
and
several
liability,
pure
several
liability,
and
then
there
are
several
permutations.
and
the
third
restatement
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
--
i
think
you
should
take
it
as
a
given
because
it
was
the
defendants'
burden
to
prove
divisibility.
but
i
think
if
you
don't
regard
the
defendants
as
having
the
burden,
i
don't
believe
there's
an
evidentiary
basis
for
feeling
confident
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
the
harm
was
indivisible.
but
with
respect
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
think
so,
and
this
court
in
norfolk
and
western
--
it
was
dealing
with
a
different
statute,
but
it
said
when
you're
looking
at
the
restatement,
it's
more
important
what
the
state
of
the
law
was
when
congress
enacted
the
statute
rather
than
what
the
common-law
principles
are
now.
and
as
we've
said
in
our
brief,
we
think
for
that
reason
the
second
restatement
is
the
more
crucial
document.
but
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
third
restatement,
one
of
the
things
you
would
find
is
that
the
drafters,
as
to
indivisible
harms,
identified
a
variety
of
approaches
that
a
local
jurisdiction
could
take,
expressly
declined
to
choose
a
preferred
one
among
them,
but
said
the
most
important
determinant
in
choosing
between
them
is
how
the
risk
that
a
particular
defendant
be
insolvent
will
be
allocated.
so
the
drafters
of
the
third
restatement
certainly
didn't
treat
insolvency
as
a
factor
that
should
be
ignored
in
citing
questions
of
an
apportionability.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
guess
that's
true.
to
the
argument
that
i've
just
been
sketching
out,
that
--
that
the
crucial
question
is
what
response
costs
the
government
would
have
been
required
to
bear
if
--
if
only
the
railroad
parcel's
contamination
had
been
at
issue,
our
argument
is
that
the
--
the
railroads
failed
to
prove
divisibility.
but
another
option
would
be
to
remand
for
factual
proceedings
to
address
that
question.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
there
is
no
"arranger"
case
going
in
either
direction
that's
on
all
fours
with
this
one
where
there
is
the
sale
of
a
useful
product
during
the
course
of
a
delivery
that
the
seller
arranged
--
that
the
seller
controlled.
