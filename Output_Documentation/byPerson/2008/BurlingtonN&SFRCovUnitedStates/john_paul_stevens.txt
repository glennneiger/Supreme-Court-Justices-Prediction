ms.
sullivan,
can
i
interrupt
you?
because
i'm
still
puzzled
by
your
answer
to
justice
alito.
are
you
conceding
that
if
in
this
case
shell
had
an
alternative
carrier
who
would
not
have
spilled
a
bit,
that
then
there
would
be
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
did
in
your
answer
to
justice
alito.
why
wouldn't
that
be?
explain
your
answer
a
little
more
fully.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
at
the
time
of
the
spill.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
is
it
essential
to
your
theory
that
shell
had
title
to
the
material
until
delivery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
it
were
a
fungible
product
and
the
purchaser
just
agreed
to
take
either
some
product
of
this
--
this
quantity
and
quality
and
so
forth,
but
they
could
substitute
other
--
other
goods
from
another
source?
would
shell
still
be
liable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
shell
gave
all
the
same
instructions
they
gave
here,
but
they
just
didn't
insist
that
it
be
their
product
rather
than
somebody
else's,
another
oil
company's
product.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
this
is
the
announcement
you've
all
been
waiting
for.
in
1960,
a
distributor
of
agricultural
chemicals
known
as
b&b
began
operating
on
a
parcel
of
land
located
in
arvin,
california.
the
business
later
expanded
onto
an
adjacent
parcel
owned
by
the
burlington
northern
&
santa
fe
railway
company
and
the
union
pacific
railroad
company.
during
its
years
of
operation,
b&b
purchased
and
stored
various
hazardous
chemicals
on
its
property
including
the
pesticide
d-d
which
was
sold
by
shell
oil
company.
over
time,
many
of
these
hazardous
substances
spilled
and
leaked
into
the
soil
and
groundwater
at
the
facility
causing
significant
contamination.
in
1989,
the
state
of
california
and
the
united
states
environmental
protection
agency
exercised
their
authority
under
the
comprehensive
environmental
response,
compensation,
and
liability
act
known
as
cercla
to
clean
up
the
arvin
ite.
seeking
to
recover
their
cause,
the
government
initiated
a
legal
action
against
shell
and
the
railroad.
the
district
court
concluded
that
both
railroads
and
shell
were
potentially
responsible
parties
under
cercla
and
it
could
be
held
fully
liable
for
the
cost
of
the
government's
response
efforts.
the
railroads,
because
they
owned
the
part
of
the
facility,
which
of
course
had
been
leased
to
b&b
and
shell
because
it
had
"arranged"
for
disposal
of
hazardous
substances
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
by
selling
and
arranging
for
the
delivery
of
the
d-d.
the
district
court
did
not
impose
joint
in
several
liability
however,
but
instead
apportioned
liability
holding
that
the
railroads
were
liable
for
9%
of
the
total
response
cost
and
shell
was
liable
for
6%.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
shell
could
be
held
liable
as
an
arranger
under
the
statute
and
affirmed
the
district
court's
decision
in
that
respect.
however,
although
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
harm
in
the
case
was
theoretically
capable
of
apportionment,
it
concluded
that
the
facts
presented
in
this
long
record
were
insufficient
to
support
apportionment
in
this
case
and
therefore
held
shell
and
the
railroads
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
the
government's
entire
response
cost
which
amounted
to
millions
of
dollars.
we
now
hold
that
shell
does
not
qualify
as
an
arranger
under
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
and
conclude
that
the
district
court's
apportionment
of
liability
with
respect
to
the
railroads
was
adequately
supported
by
the
record
evidence.
we
therefore
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
