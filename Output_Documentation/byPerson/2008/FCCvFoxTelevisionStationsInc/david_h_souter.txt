justice
david
h.

yes,
but
doesn't
--
doesn't
the
ability
to
discern
it
come
from
the
reasons
given
for
not
assessing
fines?
they
said:
we
are
not
assessing
fines.
this
is
something
new,
and
this
is
in
effect
a
warning
to
everybody
that
things
have
changed.
isn't
that
a
pretty
clear
indication
that
they
are
adopting
a
new
policy?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
one
thing
has
changed.
one
thing
has
changed,
i
think,
from
the
record.
and
let
me
ask
you
whether
if
the
commission
had
given
this
explanation
it
would
in
your
judgment
satisfy
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard?
what
if
the
commission
said,
you
know,
our
touchstone
under
prong
1
is
community
broadcast
standards.
and
we
have
assumed
over
the
years
that
people
really
didn't
get
too
exercised
by
the
usage
we
have
permitted.
but
we
are
now
getting
all
this
mail
from
people
who
are
very
angry
about
it,
and
they
find
it
extremely
offensive.
and
therefore,
i
guess
our
prior
community
broadcast
standards
were
wrong.
we
weren't
taking
into
consideration
the
way
people
actually
felt.
now
we
know
how
they
felt,
because
of
the
mail
we
are
getting
and
we
are
changing
our
policy
for
that
reason.
leaving
aside
the
constitutional
sufficiency
of
that,
in
the
matter
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
standards,
would
it
satisfy
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
raw
apa
standard
issue
is
what
we've
got
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
that's
the
case,
then
the
concept
of
constitutional
avoidance
is
--
is
somehow
out
of
this
case
and
similar
first
amendment
cases,
because
we
are
always
going
to
--
and
i
--
when
you
say
you
really
cannot
separate
that
precisely,
we
were
always
going
to
be
getting
into
the
constitutional
issue,
either
expressly
because
we
accept
your
view
or
covertly
because
we
said,
boy,
we
know
what's
around
the
corner.
and
so,
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
we
accept
your
argument,
we
have
to
change
the
constitutional
avoidance
doctrine.
justice
david
h.
souter
thank
you.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
--
i
mean
you
are
just
--
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
but
your
colloquy
with
justice
stevens
sort
of
is
a
way
of
phrasing
the
issue
in
the
case.
because
you
are
saying,
i
think,
prior
to
this
--
prior
to
the
change,
the
commission
interpreted
"indecency"
in
terms
of
indecent
practice.
and
what
the
commission
is
now
doing
is
defining
"indecency"
in
terms
of
the
meaning
of
a
word.
it's
--
it's
relatively
going
from
saying
indecency
is
a
practice,
i.e.,
a
repetition
of
certain
kinds
of
words,
to
saying
"indecency"
is
--
is
the
use
of
any
word
which
is
itself
indecent.
