mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
would
like
to
start
with
justice
scalia's
narrowest
question
in
terms
of
the
easiest
way
to
resolve
this
case,
which
is
did
the
fcc
in
its
remand
order
in
fact
recognize
that
it
had
made
a
change
in
policy
and
therefore
dealt
forthrightly
with
the
fact
that
it
had
made
a
change
in
policy.
while
it
is
true
that
the
second
circuit
was
prepared
to
accept
the
idea
that
the
commission
had
changed,
the
reality
is
you
will
read
that
opinion
without
any
ability
to
discern
that.
and
the
need--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
--
well,
that
they
are
in
fact
adopting
a
new
policy,
i
think
that
is
probably
right,
justice
souter.
i
think
the
problem
here
is
that
ordinarily
when
you
are
in
fact
forthrightly
changing
your
policy
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
agency
to
say:
we
are
changing
our
policy,
we
recognize
we
are
changing
our
policy,
and
here
is
the
explanation
for
why
we
are
changing
our
policy.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
only
thing
that's
strikingly
different
about
that,
justice
scalia,
is
they
are
very
express
in
dealing
with
issue
in
the
golden
globes
order,
which--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--general
garre
specifically
identifies.
it's
interesting,
when
you
say
where
is
it
in
the
order
under
review
when
they
say
they
are
going
to
do
that,
he
says
look
in
paragraph
12
of
the
golden
globes
order.
and
justice
ginsburg
is
absolutely
right:
this
case
came
to
the
second
circuit;
the
commission
said
no,
send
it
back;
give
us
a
full
opportunity
to
explain
exactly
what
we
are
doing.
thy
take
it
back
and
they
come
in
and
they
don't
deal
with
this
issue.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
was
part
of
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
then
provide
a
final
reviewable
order
from
the
commission,
presumably
that
defends
in
all
respects
that
decision.
but
as
i
say--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
all
--
all
i
am
suggesting,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
there
is
equally
an
opposite
language
in
which
the
commission
--
and
the
second
circuit
acknowledged
this,
too
--
in
which
the
commission
seems
to
back
off
whether
or
not
it
thinks
it
has
made
a
change
in
this
particular
order.
and
it
seems
unreliable--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--this
court
said
in
state
farm
that
when
an
agency
changes
its
position
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
agency
to
provide
more
of
an
explanation
in
that
context
than
--
than
if
it
were
adopting
the
position
in
the
first
instance.
so
i
think
yes,
if
there
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
well,
i
--
i
think
it
--
we
wouldn't
be
having
this
debate
if
the
commission
had
simply
dealt
with
this
issue
in
the
same
forthright
fashion
that
it
did
with
respect
to
the
golden
globes
order.
but
even
if
the
court
accepts
the
idea
that
there
is
a
change,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
the
commission
has
not
even
remotely
satisfied
its
--
its
obligation
to
demonstrate
that
that
change
is
not
arbitrary
and
capricious.
and
i
think--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
then
explain
why.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
that
goes
into
what
i
think
is
the
next
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
which
is
the
answer
to
the
justice
breyer's
question,
which
is
where
in
the
opinion
does
the
commission
explain
the
change
in
position
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
first
prong
of
the
indecency
standard,
which
is
whether
or
not
these
words
inherently
mean
either
sexual
or
excretory
activities;
and
there,
it
seems
to
me,
there
is
a
--
whether
there
is
a
change
or
not,
the
reality
is
that
from
1978
until
2004
this
kind
of
language
was
used
routinely,
without
the
commission
remotely
suggesting
that
every
time
it
was
used,
it
necessarily
had
a
particular
meaning.
and
then
suddenly
in
2004,
this
language
has
changed
its
tone
completely,
and
there
is
no
explanation
for
what
is
different
or
what
is
the
reason
for
adopting
that
particular
view.
the
fact
is
that
the
reading
of
that
is
so
fundamentally
at
odds
with
the
way
the
court--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--this
court
expressly
said
in
cohen
v
california,
in
talking
about
exactly
the
same
word,
that
it
cannot
plausibly
be
maintained
that
this
vulgar
allusion
would
conjure
up
such
--
up
such
psychic
stimulation.
and
if
the
court
would
say
that
in
1970,
it
applies
with
even
more
force
in
2008.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
all
that
cohen
says
is
that
you
cannot
immediately
jump
--
you
--
it
wouldn't
even
remotely
strike
you
that
the
reason
the
language
is
being
used
is
for
its
particular
sexual
meaning.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
same
reason
the
s-word
does;
it's
because
in
some
circles
it
is
inappropriate.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
i
--
to
say
that,
i
suppose
you
can
say
it,
but
i
don't
understand
on
what
basis.
there
is
no
empirical
support
for
that.
there's
no--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--anything
in
the
record
that
remotely
suggests
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
people
use
all
kinds
of
euphemisms
for
it,
and
nobody
blinks
about
it.
the
point
is
--
is
that
for
20-some
years
the
commission
didn't
draw
that
inference,
didn't
reach
that
conclusion
and
nothing
has
changed
over
those
20-some
years.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it
probably
would,
if
all
you
are
doing
is
looking
at
just
the
sort
of
raw
administrative
procedure
act
standard,
as
it
would
normally
apply
to
non-content.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
way
to
--
to
look
at
this
case.
because
i
don't
see
how
you
can
--
it
seems
to
me
a
completely
artificial
inquiry
to
look
at
this
as
you're
regulating
the
price
of
oil
going
through
a
pipeline.
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
are
regulating
the
content
of
speech,
and
therefore
the
first
amendment
ought
to
inform
everybody's
assessment
of
what
can
the
commission
do
as
it
moves--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
a
more
content-restrictive
way.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that
would
only
be--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
exactly
right,
justice
souter,
because
the
constitutional
avoidance
doctrine
is
not
going
to
be
much
of
a
problem
obviously
unless
there
is
a
grave
constitutional
threat.
so,
it's
not
every
assertion
of
the
existence
of
a
constitutional
issue
that
suddenly
triggers
withdrawal.
when
you
are
dealing
in
this
area,
which
is
content
regulation
and
restriction
on
the
basis
of
content,
it
seems
to
me
that's
inherently
a
first
amendment
problem.
and
when
you
are
in
that
world,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
agency,
even
in
the
apa
context,
has
more
of
a
responsibility,
or
at
least
the
court
should
say
it
has
more
of
a
responsibility
to
explain.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
administrative
procedure
act
expressly
says--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
administrative
procedure
act
also
says
"not
in
accordance
with
law",
which
also
refers
to
other
statutes
and
obviously
the
constitution.
so,
it's
not
as
though
i
am
asking
you
to
add
more
to
what
the
--
to
the
statute.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
i
am
asking
for
a
higher
standard
under
the
apa
because
we
are
talking
about
content-based
restrictions
on
free
speech.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
it
was
not
talking
about
restrictions
on
speech,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--this
court
hasn't
had
to
hold
that
in
any
particular
context,
but
the
reality
is,
as
a
logical
matter,
if
you
are
thinking
about
--
you
know,
there
is
an
--
a
restriction
on
"in
accordance
with
law".
the
first
amendment
is
obviously
with
law,
so
you
have
that
limitation.
and
then
you
have--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
in
order
to
avoid
those
issues--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--all
i'm
saying
is
that
it
seems
to
me
a
remarkably
artificial
inquiry,
to
look
at
this
as
if
you
are
regulating
the
price
of
oil
going
through,
to
a
pipeline
as
opposed
to
what
you
are
talking
about--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
am
perfectly
content
to
talk
about
the
apa,
because
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
apa--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
like
the
more
complicated
version,
but
i
am
happy
to
deal
with
the
simpliciter
one
as
well.
[laughter]
but
the
reality
that
goes
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
important
part
of
this
is
what
explains
this
fundamental
shift.
now,
i
think
justice
souter,
you
know,
has
probably
made
a
respectable
argument
on
apa
grounds.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
unfortunately
that's
not
the
position
that
the
fcc
took.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
have
nothing
but
the
highest
regard
for
him.
but
the
other
--
the
other
part
of
this
case
that
seems
to
have
gotten
lost
track
of
is
that
this
is
not
a
statute
that
--
that
the
commission
has
the
responsibility
to
enforce.
this
is
a
criminal
statute.
this
is
section
1464.
and
through
section
503,
the
commission
doesn't
have
broad-based
discretion
to
define
for
itself
these
terms.
the
commission
has
to
decide
what
is
indecent
within
the
meaning
of
a
federal
criminal
statute,
which
means
we
are
entitled
to
the
rule
of
lenity,
which
means
we
are
entitled
to
an
interpretation
of
that
first
prong
which,
in
dealing
with
indecency,
says
that
it
has
to
describe
or
depict
sexual
activity.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
they
are
being
lenient
in
one
sense.
i
think
you
have
to
step
back,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
recognize
what
the
--
what
we've
got
here.
we
are
talking
about
an
extraordinary
in
terrorem
regime
that
the
fcc
has
created.
and
i
would
commend
to
you
all
the
amicus
briefs
from
the
nab,
from
the
former
fcc
officials,
and
from
others
who
describe
in
exquisite
detail
the
chilling
effect
that
this
particular
scheme
may
have.
to
be
sure,
you
know,
fox
isn't
being
immediately
penalized
by
this,
but
to
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
of
general
garre,
what
he
said
--
you
know,
does
everybody
have
everything
on
tape
and
delaying?
no,
of
course
not.
and
why
not?
because
it
may
be
one
thing
for
fox
to
be
able
to
put
a
show
like
this
on
a
delayed
basis,
but
if
you
are
dealing
with
a
local
television
station
that
is
just
getting
by
hand-to-mouth,
and
they
want
to
televise
a
football
game,
and
in
the
middle
of
that
football
game
some
student
decides
to
express
himself
in
ways
that
nobody
anticipated--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
i
mean,
i
don't
remember
the
fcc
being
in
a
position
to
describe
how
children
are
able
to
perceive
one
set
of
uses
of
the
word
as
opposed
to
another
set
of
uses
of
the
word.
but
what
i
think
this
court--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--you
can't
seriously
believe
that
the
average
nine-year-old,
first
of
all,
who
is
probably
more
horrified
by
the
arm
being
blown
off
to
begin
with,
but
putting
that
aside,
you
--
it
cannot
possibly
be
that
the
child
has
more
of
a
reaction
to
that
word
in
that
context
than
if
a
young
high
school
football
player
is
running
down
the
field
screaming
a
particular
expletive.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
young
high
school
player
actually
might
be
more
of
a
celebrity
in
some
communities
than
--
at
least
than
where
i
live,
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
the
problem
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
once
you
open
the
door,
then
you
end
up
with
all
of
the
vagueness
and
overbreadth
problems
that
are
inherent
in
this
regime.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
scalia,
you
could
say
the
same
thing--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
we're
not
saying
the
same
thing.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
because
the
point
we
are
making
here
is
that
we
haven't
asked
this
court
to
revisit
pacifica.
and
the
point
is
that
when
you
move
away
from
pacifica,
which
is
the
verbal
shock
treatment
formulation,
and
say,
you
know,
that's
perfectly
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
and
with
everything
that
agency
decisionmaking
requires,
and
say
that's
all
right
--
when
you
shift
from
that,
which
is
an
enormous
switchover,
and
go
into
fleeting
expletives,
then
it's
a
fundamental
--
all
we're
saying
is
that's
a
fundamentally
different
issue
and
that
implicates
more
serious
first
amendment
issues,
because
everybody
knows
what
is
something
that
is
verbal
shock
treatment
or
at
least
we
know
how
to
stay
pretty
far
away
from
it;
whereas,
if
i
say
every
fleeting
expletive
potentially
exposes
every
broadcaster
to
$325,000
fines
made
solely
at
the
discretion
of
five
individuals,
unelected,
that
impresses
me,
your
honors,
as
simply
an
inappropriate
problem,
and
one
that
just
follows
naturally,
mr.
chief
justice,
from
saying,
well,
all
we
are
going
to
do
is
open
the
door.
because
once
you
open
the
door,
it
is
clearly
a
pandora's
box
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
it
affects
audience
share.
there
are
some
people--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
some
people
are
offended
it;
not
the
whole
community.
there
are
probably
a
lot
of
people
who
would
actually
prefer
to
have
more
of
it.
but
some--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
that's
a
heckler's
veto.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
first
of
all,
that's
a
heckler's
veto,
and
there
have
been
long
holdings
in
this
court
that
suggest
simply
pandering
to
one
small
segment
of
the
population
is
no
way
to
enforce
first
amendment
rights.
so
that's
--
i
mean,
that's
my
primary
answer
to
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't
think
there
goes
pacifica,
because
pacifica
was
only
one
person--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
what--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
the
problem
is
that
the
chief
justice's
question
was:
why
do
we
have
a
24-hour
rule.
and
the
answer
is:
it's
one
thing
for
us
to
voluntarily
assume
that.
i
think
it
is
a
mistake,
and
i
don't
know
that
--
and
i
don't
think
--
i
didn't
read
anything
in
the
commission's
opinion
that
reflects
it.
but
they
say
that
fact
suddenly
defines
the
community
standards
for
purposes
of
what
is
indecent
and
what
is
not
indecent.
that
simply
reflects
our
own
best
judgment
about
how
to
serve
our
audience.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
mean
i
--
i
believe
that
society
is
significantly
more
tolerant
of
these
words
today
than
it
was
in
--
30
years
ago.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
--
in
the
scheme
of
things,
probably
very,
very
little
to
do
with
that
compared
to
the
way
the
language
is
used.
go
to
a
baseball
game,
justice
scalia.
you
hear
these
words
every
--
every
time
you
go
to
a
ballgame.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
the
--
i
mean
i
think
what
justice
stevens
is
getting
at
is:
what
has
changed
over
the
last
30
years?
and
if
anything
has
changed,
it
would
be
exactly
the
opposite,
which
is
they
are
going
to
be
more
and
more
tolerant
of
this
language;
not
that
they
are
less
tolerant
of
this
language.
and,
therefore,
there
is
even
less
reason
for
the
commission
to
have
taken
the
position
that
it
did
in
this
particular
context.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
both.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
am
not
saying
there
is
not
a
difference,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
there
are
--
that
the
--
that
the
change
over
time
has
--
has
made
this
less
of
a
compelling
argument
than
it
would
have
been,
at
least
in
my
judgment,
in
--
in
1978.
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
different,
additional
points.
another
thing
that
has
changed
since
1978
is
that
there
is
much
more
opportunity
for
parents
to
control
access
for
their
children
because
of
the
vclip.
that's
available.
second,
in
terms
of
this
effort
to
try
to
lessen
the
coarsening
of
america--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
but
if
you
put
in
a
v-chip,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
your
parents
are
working
or
not.
the
truth
is
if
you
had
had
a
v-chip
for
the
2003
version
of
this,
which
would
have
said
pgl,
which
is
for
language,
children
couldn't
have
gotten
on
there
whether
the
parents
were
at
home
or
not.
the
v-chip
is
a
usable
and
feasible
technology
and
is
a
less
restrictive
alternative
than
the
one
that
we
have
on
the
--
on
the
table
under
these
particular
circumstances.
the
--
i
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
--
to
the
statute,
the
fact
that
this
is
a
criminal
statute.
again,
the
commission
is
not
arguing
here
for
broad
--
recognizing,
or
accepting,
or
arguing
for,
that
they
have
a
broad
delegation
of
authority.
they
don't
have
the
authority
to
decide
what
indecency
is.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
nab
amicus
brief
actually
has
a
pretty
good
description
of
a
variety
of
different
instances
in
which
this
has
--
has
occurred.
and,
of
course,
the
nab
represents
obviously
the
large
networks
but
also
all
of
the
individual
stations.
and
that,
to
me
at
least,
makes
a
compelling
argument
that
you
--
you
cannot
simply
have
one
rule
that
says:
let's
just
impose
additional
costs
on
everybody.
because
the
answer
to
that
is
that
those
stations
will
simply
refuse
to
broadcast.
and
to
me
the
best
illustration
of
it,
and
the
one
that
the
public
interest,
i
would
hope,
would
command
or
demand
the
court
take
account
of,
is
the
vermont
public
station
that
refused
to
broadcast
a
debate
or
--
or
allow
a
number
of
senatorial
candidates
to
participate
in
a
debate
because
that
candidate
had
used
expletives
in
a
previous
public
forum,
and,
therefore,
didn't
think
it
could
allow
that
broadcast
and
take
that
risk
because
it
can't
afford
to
have
the
tape-delayed
technology
that
you
are
talking
about.
and
--
and
that
to
me
is
the
quintessential
example.
but
there
are
loads
of
them,
and
it's
just
going
to
get
worse
once
you
decide
to
get
past
the
notion
that
a
fleeting
expletive,
no
matter
how
it
arises,
requires
to
you
justify
it.
because
we
went
from
a
system
that
said:
we
will,
in
general,
never
condemn
fleeting
expletives
to
the
system
that
exists
now,
which
is
we
routinely
condemn
them
unless
we
think
its
okay.
and
that's
a
system,
it
seems
to
me,
this
court
ought
not
to
countenance.
it
is
embedded
in
the
second
circuit's
decision.
the
court
should
affirm
that
decision
and
vacate
back
to
the
commission
so
that
it
can
go
forward
--
or
to
remand
back
to
the
commission
so
it
can
do
the
best
it
can
to
try
to
come
up
with
a
justification
that
satisfies
both
the
apa
and
the
first
amendment
that
it
has
not
done
so
far.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
we
did.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean
it
wasn't
a
complaint.
actually,
it
was
--
it
was
a
petition
for
review--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--going
right
to
the
second
circuit.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
so
it
doesn't
have
the
same
bill
of
particulars
that
you
might
otherwise
have.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
we
--
we
do
believe
that
the
commission
changed
its
position,
and
--
and,
again,
we
had
to
file
a
separate
petition
for
review
from
the
remand
order
over
and
above
the
petition
for
review
we
filed
from
the
first
order.
so,
you
know,
we
took
into
account
this
assessment
in
saying
we
don't
think
the
agency
had
adequately
justified
its
change
in
position.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it
--
at
least
to
me
it's
hard.
i
don't
think
so,
but
i
--
i
can
understand
that
pacifica
could
be
read
that
way,
although
in
pacifica,
itself,
george
carlin
does,
in
fact,
use
the
fleeting
expletive
in
an
explicitly
sexual
way
at
--
at
times.
but
i
--
i
think
the
hardest
case,
candidly,
is
the
situation
where
you
have
a
string
of
expletives,
all
of
which
are
clearly
not
designed
to
reflect
anything
about
sexual
activity
and
what
you
do
in
that
situation.
that
is
the
hardest
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
apologize.
i
didn't
--
i
misunderstood
your
question.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
question
--
the
first
prong
of
the
indecency
inquiry
is
whether
or
not
the
particular
language
used
does,
in
fact,
describe
or
depict
sexual
or
excretory
activities
or
organs.
and
that's
the
no.
1
inquiry.
and
i
don't
think
the
number
of
times
in
which
you
use
it
affects
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
--
i
would
have
thought
that,
since
you
were
dealing
with
a
statute
that
is
--
that
imposes
criminal
sanctions,
that
if
you
have
those
two
alternative
interpretions
available,
you
have
to
choose
the
one
that
is
more
favorable
to
the
defendant.
and,
therefore,
you
would
--
you
would
say
that
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
would
be
my
argument,
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
--
i
agree
with
that
completely,
justice
souter.
no.
that
is
exactly
how
you
can
characterize
it.
i
mean
it
may
not
be
the
precise
verbal
formulation
we
used,
but,
candidly,
that
is
it
and
essentially
the
way
judge
lebal
looked
at
it.
and
he
just
said
at
the
end
of
the
day,
because
i
have
to
defer
to
the
agency,
i
am
going
to
let
them
have
that
interpretation.
but
that
is
not
the
appropriate
approach.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
scalia,
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
would
suggest
that,
because
the
statute
says
that
the
commission
may
find
violate
--
may
impose
certain
enforcement
actions
for
people
who
violate
section
1464.
that,
of
course,
is
a
criminal
statute.
therefore,
it
is
not
a
statute
that
has
been
delegated
to
the
agency's
broad
discretion
to
decide
what
falls
within
that
language.
it
is
within
the
agency's
discretion
to
choose
a
penalty
that,
in
fact,
enforces
that
criminal
dictate.
and
to
go
back
to
justice
stevens's
position
--
i
shouldn't
give
it
as
your
position,
it
is
my
position
--
but
the
point,
i
think,
we
were
discussing,
if
you
have
a
choice
of
two
ways
to
read
indecency,
you
have
to
read
it
in
a
way
more
favorable
to
the
defendant,
that
precludes
the
approach
that
the
government
has
taken
in
this
particular
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
i
would
reserve.
