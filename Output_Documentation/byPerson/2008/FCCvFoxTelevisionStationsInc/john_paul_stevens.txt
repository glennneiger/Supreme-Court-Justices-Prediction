isn't
it
true
that
--
isn't
it
true
that
that
is
a
word
that
often
is
used
with
--
with
no
reference
whatsoever
to
the
--
the
sexual
connotation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it's
equally
--
it's
equally
subject
to
being
treated
as
indecent
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
regardless
of
which
meaning
was
actually
apparent
to
everybody
who
listened
to
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
wasn't
the
rationale
for
the
lesser
standard
largely
the
scarcity
of
the
frequencies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
relied
on
it
in
red
lion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i
shouldn't
ask
this,
but
is
there
ever
appropriate
for
the
commission
to
take
into
consideration
at
all
the
question
whether
the
particular
remark
was
really
hilarious,
very,
very
funny?
some
of
these
things
----
[laughter]
--you
can't
help
but
laugh
at.
is
that
--
is
that
a
proper
consideration,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
is
--
if
there
is
a
change
in
the
community
standards,
does
that
justify
a
change
in
the
fcc's
policies?
and
the
second
question
and
the
reason
i
ask
that
is:
do
you
think
today
the
community
generally
is
more
offended
by
these
words
or
more
tolerant
of
these
words--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
compared
to
what
pacifica
was
concerned
with?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
phillips?
i
guess
in
the
--
in
the
last
analysis
we
are
trying
to
decide
what
the
word
"indecent"
means.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
think
that
the
word
"indecent"
can
have
--
that
--
that
a
fleeting
expletive
could
be
not
indecent,
but
the
same
words
could
be
indecent
if
they
are
repeated
several
times?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i
--
i
am
not
--
not
sure
i
make
my
question
as
clear
as
i
should.
if
we
are
trying
to
define
the
term
"indecent"--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--does
the
--
does
the
number
of
times
the
word
is
used
in
a
particular
context
make
a
difference
in
the
definition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
a
matter
of
statutory
definition,
if
a
particular
word
can
describe
those
activities,
it
is
equally
indecent
if
used
for
a
different
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
not
be
indecent.
that
is
the
interpretation--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
should
accept.
let's
say
because
one
interpretation
of
an
ambiguous
word
would
not
be
indecent,
you
are
saying
the
rule
of
lenity
in
that
sort
of
approach
would
require
in
a
criminal
case
to
just
adopt
that
--
that
definition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
ask
one
question
that
just
occurred
to
me?
do
you
think
the
use
of
the
word
dung,
d-u-n-g,
would
be
indecent?
