mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
challenge
to
the
efforts
of
the
federal
communications
commission
to
carry
out
its
statutory
mandate
under
18
u.s.c.
1464,
and
more
even-handedly
address
indecent
material
that
is
broadcast
directly
into
the
home
during
the
time
of
day
when
children
are
likely
to
be
in
the
viewing
audience.
after
reconsidering
its
policy
in
this
area,
the
commission
determined
that
an
enforcement
action
may
be
appropriate
in
the
case
of
indecent
language
that
is
isolated
as
well
as
repeated.
because
the
commission
provided
a
reasoned
explanation
for
that
change
in
course,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
invalidating
its
action
under
the
administrative
procedures
act.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
they
did
change
the
policy,
justice
scalia,
and
the
commission
directly
acknowledged
that
in
paragraph
12
of
the
golden
globe
awards
order,
which
is
not
reprinted
in
the
petition
appendix.
in
that
paragraph,
the
commission
said,
"we
now
depart
from
cases
holding
that
isolated
or
fleeting
use
of
the
f-word
was
not
indecent.
"
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized,
and
we
think
correctly
so,
that
the
commission
did
change
its
position
on
that.
the
commission
had
never
brought
an
enforcement
action
against
a
broadcaster
for
the
isolated
use
of
an
expletive,
and
the
commission
made
clear
in
the
orders
it
issued
in
this
case,
beginning
with
the
golden
globe
awards
order
and
the
particular
omnibus
and
remand
orders
before
this
court,
that
it
was
taking
a
change
in
regulatory
course
in
determining
that
it
was
appropriate
to
bring
an
enforcement
action
where
there
was
an
isolated
incident
of
an
expletive
if
the
context
suggested
that
it
would
be
indecent
in
that
situation.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
that
it
has
changed,
justice
kennedy,
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
at
pages
20a
to
21a
of
the
decision.
and
we
think
this
court
has
recognized--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
think
there
were
some
statements,
we
would
acknowledge
that,
in
different
places.
but
if
you
go
to
the
heart
of
where
the
fcc
grappled
with
this,
paragraph
--
paragraph
12
of
the
golden
globe
awards
order,
it
specifically
disavowed
its
prior
decisions
in
which
it
had
said
that
isolated
expletives
would
not
warrant
an
enforcement
action
under
1464,
and
it
specifically
said,
"we
are
departing
from
our
policy.
"
we
--
after
all,
it
didn't
impose--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
if
you
look
at
maybe
pages
82
to
83
of
the
petition
appendix
here,
where
we
discuss
that
as
well,
i
think
it
made
clear
with
respect
to
the
indecency
finding
involving
the
2003
billboard
music
awards
and
the
2002
billboard
music
awards,
that
in
applying
its
contextual
analysis
in
the
past
it
focused
on
whether
or
not
expletives
were
repeated
or
dwelled
upon.
in
this
case,
the
commission
determined
that
it
was
not
going
to
be
guided
exclusively
by
that
consideration
and
that
it
was
going
to
take
into
account
all
contextual
factors,
including
the
explicit
and
graphic
nature
of
the
language
used.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
certainly,
i
would
be
defending
it
if
the
court
thought
that
it
wasn't
a
change,
and
it
would
have
been
inappropriate
for
the
second
circuit
to
invalidate
that
as
arbitrary
and
capricious.
we
have
--
we
think
it
was
a
change.
the
language
that
the
commission
used
indicated
that
it
was
departing
from
its
prior
understanding,
and
we
are
here
defending
--
either
way,
we
are
here
defending--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
this
court
has
said
that
it's
desirable
for
agencies
to
reconsider
and
to
change
its
policy
from
time
to
time,
but
when--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--it
is,
and
it
did
in
the
remand
order
reprinted
in
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
either
way
the
ultimate
standard
is
arbitrary
and
capriciousness.
now,
the
respondents
have
focused
on
whether
or
not
we
have
complied
with
the
criteria
that
the
court
has
looked
to
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
change
in
agency
position
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
and
we
think
that
there
are
three
factors
here
that
must
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
arbitrary
and
capricious.
one,
we
think
that
the
commission
did
directly
acknowledge
its
change
in
position.
two,
the
commission
provided
a
concrete
explanation
for
that
change.
and,
three,
that
explanation
is
at
a
minimum
plausible
and
consistent
with
the
commission's
statutory
mandate.
this
court
has
never
invalidated
a
change
in
agency
position
where
those
three
factors
have
been
present.
and
if
you
look
at
the
three
principal
justifications
that
the
agency
used
in
explaining
its
change
in
position,
i
think
it's
absolutely
clear
that
this
was
at
a
minimum
a
rational
policy
choice
that
the
agency
was
committed
--
was
permitted
to
take
under
the
administrative
procedures
act.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
we
do
think,
of
course,
that
there
is
rhyme
or
reason
to
its
determination.
first,
let
me
say
that
much
of
the
vagueness
type
of
arguments
that
the
respondents
are
making
similar
to
your
question
could
be
made
equally
with
respect
to
the
commission's
policy
with
respect
to
repeated
utterances
as
well
as
isolated
utterances.
if
you
take
the
"saving
private
ryan"
and
the
blues
documentary
example,
those
were
repeatedutterances
cases.
we
are
here
because
they
challenged
the
commission's
change
in
policy
to
go
from
repeated
utterances
to
consider
enforcement
actions
in
the
case
of
isolated
expletives
where
they
met
its
contextual
analysis
and
where
it
was
explicit,
graphic,
shocking
or
pandering
in
the
context.
now,
i
think
certainly
there
are
going
to
be
situations
and
this
court
has
indicated
that
the
vagueness
inquiry
doesn't
turn
about
coming
up
with
hypotheticals
at
--
at
the
outer
margins
of
the
standard.
i
think
in
the
pacifica
case
our
reading
of
the
court's
decision
is
similar
to
the
d.c.
circuit's
reading
of
that
decision
in
the
action
for
children's
television
case,
that
implicit
in
the
court's
decision
in
pacifica
was
that
it
rejected
a
vagueness
challenge
to
the
commission's
definition
of
"indecency",
which
is
the
same
definition
that
the
commission
is
applying
today.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
the
commission
has
determined
that
news
programming
would
be
treated
differently,
with
greater
restraint,
because
of
the
different
values
present
in
that
situation.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
yes.
and,
similarly,
if
there
were
a
news
report
about
the
argument
today
in
this
court
and
there
were
reports
about
the
actual
language
used,
that's
right.
the
commission
has
exercised
restraint
in
that
area,
recognizing
that
there
are
different
values
at
stake
than
in
the
--
in
the
utterance
of
indecent
language
during
a
prime-time
broadcast
where
are
a
substantial
number
of
children
in
the
viewing
audience.
for
the
broadcast
in
this
case,
up
to
24
to
28
percent
of
the
viewing
audience
comprised
children
under
the
age
of
18.
this
language
was
concededly
gratuitous
in
the
context
it
was
used.
in
the
nicole
richey
example
in
2003,
there
was
an
element
of
pandering
as
part
of
the
dialogue
consisted
of
paris
hilton
saying,
fcc
reasonably
determined,
was
shocking
and
gratuitous
and
explicit
and
graphic;
and,
therefore,
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
presented,
indecent
under
the
agency's
longstanding
definition
of
"indecency".
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
certainly,
the
fcc's
action
in
this
case
focuses
on
the
use
of
the
f-word
and
the
s-word,
and
i
think
everyone
acknowledges
that
a
word
like
the
f-word
is
one
of
the
most
graphic,
explicit,
and
vulgar
words
in
the
english
language
for
sexual
activity.
and
i
think
even
the
networks
here
concede
that
it
was
--
its
use
was
gratuitous
and
inappropriate
here.
and
that
would
control--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--it
can
be
--
it
certainly
can
be
used
in
a
non-literal
way.
it
can
be
used
in
a
metaphorical
way,
as
cher
used
it
here,
to
say
"f
them"
to
her
critics.
but
the
--
the
non-literal/literal
distinction
is
not
unique
to
the
isolated
expletives
versus
the
repeated
effort
--
expletives.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
i
wouldn't
say
equally,
justice
stevens,
but
what
we
would
say
is
that
it
can
qualify
as
indecent
under
the
--
under
the
commission's
definition,
because
even
the
non-literal
use
of
a
word
like
the
f-word,
because
of
the
core
meaning
of
that
word
as
one
of
the
most
vulgar,
graphic,
and
explicit
words
for
sexual
activity
in
the
english
language,
it
inevitably
conjures
up
a
core
sexual
image.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
which
is,
indeed,
why
it's
used
as
an
intensifier
or
as
an
insult,
and
it's
why
the
networks
themselves
--
and
this
is
reprinted,
i
believe,
at
86
of
the
petition
appendix
--
have
a
24-hour
rule
that
the
f-word
generally
should
not
be
use
on
tv.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
outside
of
the
safe
harbor
under
this
court's
decision,
the
--
the
commission
recognizes
that
networks
can
use
indecent
language.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
although
they
don't.
their
policies
are
not
to
use
indecent
language.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
because
i
think
they
recognize
that
it
contravenes
community
standards
for
appropriateness
in
the
broadcast
medium,
and
that
--
those
policies
are
reprinted
at
pages
86a
to
88a
of--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
first
of
all,
the
community
standards
are
community
standards
for
the
broadcast
medium.
this
is
set
out
a
little
bit
at
page
33
of
the
joint
appendix
at
footnote
13.
second
of
all,
they
look
to
community
standards
for
the
average
listener.
and,
third
of
all,
the
--
the
commission
applies
its
expressly
--
collective
experience
here,
looking
to
statements
from
lawmakers,
from
courts,
from
broadcasters,
from
public
interest
groups,
and
from
citizens
to
determine
what
is
consistent
with
community
standards.
and
certainly
the--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--absolutely.
i
think
it
is
an
irrefutable
reflection
of
what
they
think
the
appropriate
community
standards
are.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
community
standards
for
broadcasting,
that's
right.
and,
in
that
respect,
this
case
is
much
different
than
the
reno
case,
for
example,
where
one
of
the
criticisms
this
court
had
was
uncertainty
about
what
community
standards
would
apply.
another
difference
is
--
is
that
here
you
have
the
commission,
an
expert
agency,
making
these
determining
--
making
these
determinations,
drawing
in
part
on
the
policies
and
practices
of
the
regulated
industry
itself;
for
example,
the
self-imposed
rule
not
to
use
the
f-word
at
particular
times
of
day.
and,
of
course,
you
have
the
fact
that
broadcast
television
has
always
been
subject
to
a
lesser
standard
of
first
amendment
scrutiny.
now--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--we
think
it
is,
and
we
think
it
is
reflected
in
the
court's
cases.
let
me
--
and
let
me
explain
why.
but
let
me
first
say
that
obviously
we
think
that
this
court
does
not
need
to,
and
should
not,
delve
into
the
constitutional
issues
in
resolving
the
case
before
it
today.
the
only
issue
that
we
have
presented
and
the
only
issue
decided
below
is
whether
or
not
the
commission
has
provided
a
reasoned
explanation
of
the
administrative
procedures
act.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
if
--
if
i
can
answer
the
question
as
to
the
force
of
the
court's
precedents,
this
court
has
repeatedly
affirmed
in
cases
like
sable,
in
cases
like
reno,
in
cases
like
turner
and
denver
area,
that
broadcasting
is
subject
to
a
different
and
lesser
first
amendment
standard.
the
commission
in
this
case
looked
to
the
considerations
that
underlie
that
jurisprudential
doctrine
and
concluded
that
they
were
still
apposite,
and
that
is
at
pages
108
to
110
of
the
petition
appendix.
most
americans
still
get
their
information
and
entertainment
from
broadcast
tv.
most
children
--
broadcast
tv
is
extremely
accessible
to
children
because
all
they
have
to
do
is
turn
it
on,
and
then
they
have
network
shows
that
they
can
have
access
to.
and
broadcast
television
is
still
broadcast
in
a
way
that
invades
the
home,
the
place
--
the
one
place
where
people
typically
don't
expect
to
have
uninvited,
offensive--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
that
was
the
rationale
in
red
--
red
lion.
this
is
court
in
pacifica
didn't
rely
on
that
rationale.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
yes.
i
--
as
we
read
the
decision,
justice
stevens
--
and
i
understand
that
you
wrote
the
plurality
decision
there.
but,
as
we
read
the
decision,
the
court
did
not
rest
so
much
on
the
scarcity
rationale,
but,
yet,
on
the
unique
pervasiveness
of
broadcasting,
the
unique
accessibility
to
children,
and
the
fact
that
broadcasting
invades
the
home
in
a
way
that
other
technologies
do
not.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
it
was,
your
honor.
now,
in
the
turner
case
this
court
said
at
page
190
that
broadcast
medium
is
still
the
principal
source
of
information
in
entertainment
in
affirming
the
lesser
standard
that
this
court
applies.
we
actually
think
that
the
fact
that
there
are
now
additional
mediums
like
the
internet
and
cable
tv,
if
anything,
underscores
the
appropriateness
of
a
lower
first
amendment
standard
or
safety
zone
for
broadcast
tv,
because
americans
who
want
to
get
indecent
programming
can
go
to
cable
tv,
they
can
go
to
the
internet.
but
broadcast
tv
is,
as
congress
designed
that
to
be,
the
one
place
where
americans
can
turn
on
the
tv
at
8:00
o'clock
and
watch
their
dinner
and
not
be
expected
to
be
bombarded
with
indecent
language,
either
in
an
isolated
basis
or
repeated
basis.
that's
a
societal
expectation
that
has
grown
up
over
the
last
30
years
since
pacifica.
and
it
would
be
a
remarkable
thing
to
adopt
the
world
that
the
networks
are
asking
you
to
adopt
here
today,
where
the
networks
are
free
to
use
expletives,
whether
in
an
isolated
or
repeated
basis,
24
hours
a
day,
going
from
the
extreme
example
of
big
bird
dropping
the
f-bomb
on
sesame
street,
to
the
example
of
using
that
word
during
jeopardy
or
opening
the
episode
of
american
idol--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--with
respect
to
live
entertainment
programming,
justice
breyer,
you
can
do
what
the
networks
now
do,
which
is
to
have
a
tape
delay
which
permits
you
to
bleep
out
isolated
or
offensive--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
it
varies
based
on
the
type
of
programming.
for
example,
the
commission
has
acknowledged
--
and
this
is
at
pages
94
to
95a
of
the
petition
appendix
--
that
their
--
that
breaking
news
coverage
is
different
and
that
it
will
not
approach
it--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
don't
think
--
that's
not--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--in
a
show
like
the
billboard
music
awards,
they
will
use
a
delay.
and
since
the
incidents
in
this
case,
the
2003
and
2002
instances,
the
networks
have
gotten
more
people
who
are
on
hand
to
bleep
isolated
expletives.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
they
did,
and
i
think--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
if
you
look
at
the
nicole
richie
example,
they
actually
bleeped
one
word
that
was
used,
i
believe--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--before
she
got
to
the
other
two
words.
but
at
that
time
they
only
had
one
person
working
the
bleeping
machine
or
whatever
it
is
they
call
it.
[laughter]
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
that's
right.
but
certainly
there
is
an
understanding
that
this
is
--
that
these
isolated--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--it
explained
that--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--in
its
decision
in
the
petition
appendix
here
as
to
the
basis
why
enforcement
action
would
be
appropriate.
because
here
you
are
dealing
with
individuals
who
have
used
inappropriate
in
the
past
--
nicole
richie
had
used
inappropriate
language
in
the
past.
you
had
an
inappropriate
tape
delay,
you
had
inappropriate
measures
in
place
to
ensure
that
expletives
were
not
used,
which
in
the
commission's
judgment
meant
that
this
would
be
an
appropriate
situation.
if
you
had
a
different
context,
say
a
sporting
event
where
there
is
an
isolated
expletive
as
part
of
a
post-game
news
interview,
the
commission
as
it
would
under
its
context-based
approach,
would
look
to
all
the
contextual
factors
and
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
indecent
in
that
situation.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
certainly
our
view
is
that
it
was
pandering
and
invited.
it
could
have
been
expected.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
the
euphemism
in
the
script
i
think
was
"freaking",
and
another
euphemism
for
the
s-word,
but
they
obviously
departed
from
that.
and
i
think
the
commission--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
what
paris
hilton
said.
i
mean,
i
think
the
whole
thing
was
set
up
to
be
pandering--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--to
invite
this
kind
of
abuse,
which
is
one
of
the
contextual
factors
that
the
commission
looked
at,
along
with
the
extremely
shocking
and
graphic
nature
of
using
this
language
at
9:00
p.m.
on
an
eastern
night.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
we
did
not
fine
them
because
we
exercised
restraint
in
making
--
in
attempting
to
make
clear
that
the
fcc
going
forward
was
going
to
consider
isolated--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--we
had
gone
from
pacifica
until
1987,
approximately,
in
the
action
for
children's
television
case,
where
the
commission
determined
that
that
approach
limited
only
to
the
seven
dirty
words
in
pacifica
was
unduly
narrow
and
inconsistent
with
its
enforcement
responsibilities.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
but
i
don't
--
my
understanding
was
that
was
not
pertaining
to
use
of
the
f-word.
the
networks'
policies
are
at
86
to
88a,
the
petition
appendix,
and
described
there.
the
d.c.
circuit
found
with
respect
to
that
change
in
position
that
the
commission
had
supplied
an
adequate
explanation
under
the
apa
simply
by
saying
that
its
prior
practice,
enforcement
practice,
was
unduly
narrow
and
not
consistent
with
its
enforcement
responsibility.
we
think
that
the
even
more
detailed
explanation
here
clearly
satisfies
the
apa
standard
that
applied
to
the
commission's
change
in
position.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
yes,
insofar
as
the
commission
takes
into
account
whether
it's
shocking,
titillating,
pandering--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
my
point
is
that
we
will
take
it
into
account,
but
i
think
you
can
recognize
the
potentially
greater
harmful
impact
on
children
where
you
have
celebrities
using
particularly
graphic,
vulgar,
explicit,
indecent
language
as
part
of
the
comedic
routine
during
a
show
that
children
are
comprising
a
substantial
part
of
the
viewing
audience.
and
that
is
one
of
the
factors
that
is
appropriate
under
this
court's
decision
in
pacifica
and
the
commission's
policy
to
take
into
account
the
time
of
day
and
the
viewing
audience.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
right.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
prong
1
hasn't
changed,
justice
breyer,
since
the
time--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--of
pacifica.
it
has
not.
it's
the
same
explanation,
whether
descriptions
or
depictions
of
sexual
or
excretorial
organs
or
activities,
the
same
definition
before
the
court
in
pacifica.
and
as
the
pacifica
monologue
makes
clear,
there
were
many
both
literal
and
non-literal
uses
of
the
f-word
and
s-word
and
other
words
in
that
monologue.
so,
i
think
the
commission's
position
is
this
kind
of
language
has
always
been
indecent,
which
is
--
what
has
changed
is
it's
now
going
to
consider
enforcement
action
when
is
it's
used
in
an
isolated
basis
on
a
contextbased
approach.
if
i
can
reserve--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
that
approach
would
be
consistent
with
this
court
not
deciding
issues
that
haven't
been
decided
below
and
the
general
practice
of
constitutional
avoidance.
now,
the
second
circuit
at
three
different
places
in
its
decision,
on
page
2a
and
page
35a,
and
at
the
end
of
its
decision,
made
clear
that
it
was
not
deciding
the
constitutional
issues.
judge
laval
who
dissented
didn't
say
anything
about
the
constitutional
issues.
so
we
certainly
want
another
crack
at
those
issues
before
the
second
circuit,
and
respondents
after
all
are
not
simply
asking
this
court
to
hold
the
regulation
of
isolated
expletives
is
unconstitutional,
but
that
any
broadcast
indecency
regulation
is
unconstitutional;
and
at
a
minimum
before
this
court
entertains
that
kind
of
radical
constitutional
shift,
it
ought
to
have
the
benefit
of
a
court
of
appeals
decision
which
actually
decides
those
issues.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
we
think
the
court
is
forced
to
decide
that
because
that's
the
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
invalidated
the
commission's
action.
the
court
should
reject
that
decision
which
is
incorrect
under
the
apa
and
send
it
back
for
consideration
of
the
networks'
other
arguments.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
justice
scalia,
it's
on
page
82-a
of
the
petition
appendix
where
the
commission
acknowledges
the
change
in
the
order
at
issue
in
this
case.
justice
breyer,
going
back
to
your
question
about
whether
the
commission's
definition
of
indecency
has
changed,
it
is
not
and
that
is
made
clear
at
page
73-a
of
the
petition
appendix
where
the
commission
says,
quote,
a
long
line
of
precedence
indicates
that
the
use
of
the
f-word
for
emphasis
or
as
an
intensifier
comes
within
the
subject
matter
scope
of
our
indecency
definition.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
it
explains
on
page
74
why
the
commission
has
determined
that
these
words
are
indecent.
the
commission
has
only
treated
those
literal
and
non-literal
uses
of
these
words
as
potentially
indecent
under
its
contextual
analysis.
we
think
that
justice
ginsburg's
decision
for
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
action
for
children's
television
case
provides
a
road
map
for
resolving
this
case,
where
the
court
separately
addressed
the
apa
question
of
whether
the
agency
had
provided
a
reasonable
explanation
and
then
separated
out
the
constitutional
issues,
which
this
court
need
not
address.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
it
would
probably
qualify
under
the
subject
matter
definition,
but
it
probably
wouldn't
be
patently
offensive
under
community
standards
for
broadcasting.
the
one
thing
that
can't
be
disputed
seriously
in
this
case
is
that
the
f-word
is
patently
offensive
under
community
standards
for
the
broadcast
medium.
this
court
has
reversed
the
decision
below
on
the
apa
question
presented
and
remand
the
case
for
consideration
under--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we
certainly
think
that
under
community
standards
that
that
word
is
patently
offensive
as
well.
and
certainly,
but
we
think
that
the
f-word
itself
is
clearly
patently
offensive.
we
think
that
the
s-word
is
patently
offensive.
this
court
did
so
--
we
think
had
that
view
in
the
pacifica
case
as
well,
because
that,
of
course,
is
one
of
the
seven
dirty
words
at
issue
in
that
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
