well,
is
the
agency's
position
that
its
policy
has
changed
or
that
it
has
not
changed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
court
recognized,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
fcc
--
and
this
is
what
justice
scalia's
questions
go
in
part
to
--
in
the
remand
order
at
first
it
said
its
policy
hadn't
changed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
talking
about
community
standards
for
broadcasting?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
that
works.
i
haven't
looked
at
the
statistics
on
one-parent
families,
working
parents,
and
so
forth.
those
factors
both
have
to
be
considered.
