chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
07-582,
federal
communications
commission
versus
fox
television
stations.
mr.
garre.
solicitor
general
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think,
in
terms
of
our
legal
review,
it
makes
a
difference
whether
it's
a
change
or
whether
it's
a
continuation
of
a
prior
policy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
my
question
is,
do
you
think
a
different
legal
standard
applies
when
an
agency
changes
a
prior
position
as
opposed
to
articulating
its
position
for
the
first
time?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
the
most
difficult
case
for
you
is
the
"early
news"
case
where
you
have
just
a
fleeting
expletive,
unlike
"saving
private
ryan"
and
the
others.
i
mean,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
"early
news"
case
from
the
ones
before
us?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
same
--
if
you
had
a
news
report
about
nicole
richey
and
the
cher
exhibits,
they
--
they
could
use
the
actual
language,
even
though
they
can't
during
the
--
the
awards
shows?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
is
an
entirely
voluntary
--
i
mean,
the
commission
would
have
no
objection
if
the
f-word
were
used
on
a
regular
basis
after
10:00
o'clock?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
the
broadcasters'
own
voluntary
determination
not
to
use
that
--
that
language
24
hours
is
a
reflection
of
what
they
think
about
community
standards.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
still,
i
gather
that's
at
issue
with
the
constitutional
questions.
does
that
still
have
the
same
force
today
when
the
broadcast
medium
is
only
one
of
several
that
are
--
that
are
available?
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
commission
might
not
be
accomplishing
terribly
much
if
it
regulates
a
particular
medium
when
all
sorts
of
other
media,
media,
are
available
that
don't
have
the
commission's
oversight.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
garre.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
the
commission
said
is
that
the
prior
decisions
or
guidance
was
seriously
flawed
and
we
reaffirmed
that
it
was
appropriate
to
disavow
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
recognizing
a
change
and
rejecting
it.
it's
at
page
82a.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
same
question
that
i
asked
your
friend:
does
it
matter?
don't
we
look
at
the
commission's
order
and
determine
whether
it's
a
reasonable
explanation,
whether
they
view
it
as
a
change
or
not?
it
seems
to
me
that
they
kind
of
said
you
can
view
it
as
a
change
because
the
staff
had
these
decisions,
and
there
was
dicta;
or
it's
not
a
change.
but
the
point
--
important
point
is
whether
or
not
they
provided
a
reasonable
explanation
for
their
current
position.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
it
says
in
state
farm
--
what
it
says
in
state
farm
is
that
an
agency's
view
of
what
is
in
the
public
interest
may
change
either
with
or
without
a
change
in
circumstances.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
reason
there
is
a
change
is
they
looked
at
it
and
they
decided
it
was
wrong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
agree
it's
enough
of
a
justification
for
the
change
that
they
think
the
other
policy
was
wrong?
they
don't
have
to
say
circumstances
have
changed,
the
facts
are
different;
it's
enough
to
say,
"well,
whatever
the
commission
used
to
thing,
we
think
differently?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
then
explain
why.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
not
the
commission's
position.
the
commission's
position
here
is
not
when
these
words
were
used,
people
necessarily
thought
of
a
literal
meaning;
instead,
its
position
is
that
the
reason
these
words
shocked
is
because
of
its
association
with
the
literal
meaning.
that's
a
different
question
than
what
was
being
addressed
in
cohen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
why
--
why
do
you
think
the
f-word
has
shocking
value
or
emphasis
or
force?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
it
is
associated
with
sexual
or
excretory
activity.
that's
what
gives
it
its
--
its
force.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
that
consistent
with
vermont
yankee?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
you
are
saying
that
we
add
to
the
apa
when
we
are
dealing
with
a
particular
area.
which
of
our
cases--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--which
of
our
cases
supports
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe
sometime--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
be
in
a
position
to
argue
your
constitutional
issue,
but
we
can't
assume
that
you
are
right
on
the
constitution
in
applying
the
apa.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
when
you
talk
about
the
rule
of
lenity,
i
mean,
the
point
is
that
this
change
--
if
there
is
a
change
in
policy
or
whether
it's
adequately
explained
--
simply
gets
you
in
the
door.
they
say
then,
once
you
are
there,
we
just
look
at
all
of
the
circumstances
and
the
context.
so,
we
don't
--
it
seems
to
me
in
their
enforcement
decisions,
their
decision
not
to
impose
sanctions,
their
decision
not
to
have
this
count
against
you
in
future
proceedings,
they
are
being
very
lenient.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
this
is
where
the
context
comes
in.
at
least
with
impressionable
children,
that's
dramatically
different
from
saying
here
is
an
awards
show,
here
is
a
celebrity,
i
want
to
listen
to
what
they
are
going
to
say
because
i
listen
to
their
music,
and
he
comes
out
with
that,
as
opposed
to
a
football
game.
they
know
that,
you
know,
somebody
says
a
bad
word
in
the
middle
of
the
interview.
the
context
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
perceive
that.
they
know.
i
mean,
it's
one
thing
to
use
the
word
in,
say,
saving
private
ryan,
when
your
arm
gets
blown
off.
it's
another
thing
to
do
it
when
you
are
standing
up
at
an
awards
ceremony.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
--
the
young
football
player
is
not
a
celebrity
that
they
follow.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
point
is
whether
they
are
or
not
is
the
contextual
determination
that
the
fcc
can
undertake.
all
they
are
saying
is
that
just
because
it's
used
once
doesn't
mean
you
are
out
of
the
--
out
of
the
woods
altogether.
let's
look
at
it,
and
if
it
turns
out
there's
no
--
i
mean,
this
is
the
point
they
make,
that
in
one
context,
it's
completely
gratuitous;
in
the
other
context,
it's
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
why
do
your
clients
not
use
these
words
between
10:00
p.m.
and
6:00
a.m.?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
do
you
think
it
affects
audience
share?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
can
take
that
into
consideration,
why
can't
the
fcc
make
the
same
determination,
that
there
may
be
some
people
offended
by
this,
and
if
there
are
some
people,
as
part
of
our
statutory
responsibility,
we
are
going
to
look
at
it.
not
that
they
automatically
impose--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--not
that
they
automatically
impose
a
sanction,
but
that
they're
going
to
look
at
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
general
garre,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
announcement
this
morning
in
case
07-582,
fcc
versus
fox
television.
