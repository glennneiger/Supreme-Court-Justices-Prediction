justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
the
commission
--
the
commission
asked
the
second
circuit,
said:
we've
changed
our
policy;
we
want
you
to
remand
the
case
to
the
commission
so
the
commission
can
explain
what
its
new
policy.
i
mean,
isn't
that
how
this
whole
thing
arose?
the
case
was
in
the
second
circuit
and
the
commission
said
it
wanted
to
have
an
opportunity
to
explain
its
position
more
fully?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of
the
problems
is
that,
seeing
it
in
operation,
there
seems
to
be
no
rhyme
or
reason
for
some
of
the
decisions
that
the
commission
has
made.
i
mean,
the
"saving
private
ryan"
case
was
filled
with
expletives,
and
yet
the
film
about
jazz
history,
the
words
were
considered
a
violation
of
the
commission's
policies.
so
that
there
seems
to
be
very
little
rhyme
or
reason
to
when
the
commission
says
that
one
of
these
words
is
okay
and
when
it
says
it
isn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
only
those
two
words
in
the
fcc's
new
policy
or
are
there
other
words
on
the
list?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
are
the
contemporary
community
standards
determined
in
this
context?
does
the
fcc
survey
any
particular
audience
to
find
out
what
their
standards
are?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
before
the
internet.
pacifica
was
in
1978.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there
a
different
word?
wasn't
there
a
euphemism
in
the
script?
i
thought
there
was
a
euphemism
in
the
script.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
you
had
gone
from
pacifica
until
2004
with
a
different
policy,
where
this
kind
of
thing
would
have
been
okay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
remind
me
about
that,
because
there
was
--
the
statement
that
the
networks
don't
do
this
at
all
at
the
time
of
action
for
children's
television,
the
fight
was,
was
it
going
to
be
from
midnight
'til
whatever
it
was.
the
networks
wanted
more
hours
for
adult
viewing.
they
said
the
only
hours
that
the
commission
gave
them
were
hours
when
most
everybody
is
asleep.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
it's
about
the
bottom
line
of
your
brief.
this
whole
argument
has
an
air
of
really
futility,
because
the
second
circuit
more
than
tipped
its
hand
when
it
said:
and
even
as
they
gave
a
reasoned
explanation,
we
have
grave
doubts
whether
this
would
be
constitutional.
you
suggested
in
your
brief
a
remand
for
briefing
and
a
hearing
in
the
second
circuit
on
the
constitutional
issue.
so,
is
there
a
way
that
we
can
say,
well,
really,
this
issue
that's
before
us
now
is
ignoring
the
big
elephant
in
the
rule,
room;
we
have
to
get
to
that
anyway?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
that
be
--
could
that
be
done
without
deciding
this
apa
or
are
we
forced
to
decide
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips,
this
--
this
is
similar
to
the
question
that
i
asked
general
garre.
the
commission
asked
for
a
remand
so
it
could
provide
a
reasoned
explanation.
but
you
had
or
your
clients
had
--
in
their
complaint
they
made
an
apa
claim
as
well
as
a
first
amendment
claim,
didn't
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
correct.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
could
have
just
done
the
first
amendment,
but
you
--
you
did
put
the
apa
into
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
the
s-word
in
there
too,
and
even
judge
leval
says
he
didn't
understand
why
that
word
should
be
on
the
list.
