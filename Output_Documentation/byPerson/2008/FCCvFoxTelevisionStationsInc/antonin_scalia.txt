justice
antonin
scalia
did
it
--
did
it
reconsider
its
policy?
in
the
first
order,
i
would
--
i
would
have
gathered
that
it
had,
but
its
second
order
said
basically,
we've
never
had
a
policy
that
single
use
of
these
expletives
is
okay.
which
is
it?
are
they
changing
their
policy
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
latest
order,
the
one
that's
up
here,
says
that
all
of
the
statements
to
that
effect
in
the
past
were
simply
staff
statements
and
that
the
commission
had
never
held
to
that
effect
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
think
it
rewrote
that
in
its
last
order,
and
i
think
it
even
explained
away
the
golden
globe
statement
by
saying
it
was
not
as
categorical
as
it
might
appear.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is,
indeed,
why
it's
used.
justice
antonin
scalia
although
they
don't,
i
gather.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
they
find
it
offensive,
i
gather.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
had
a
5-second
delay
at
the
time
these
things
occurred,
didn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
that
they
weren't
fast
enough
or
something?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
whom
you
are
dealing
with,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
paris
hilton
incident
was
scripted.
the
use
of
the
indecent
word
was
almost
invited,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
was
sort
of
an
invitation.
i
mean,
before
she
was
introduced,
said,
"now
we're
on
live
television,
you
have
to
watch
your
mouth.
"
or
something
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
a
setup.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
didn't
fine
them,
anyway,
did
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it's
funny.
i
mean,
bawdy
jokes
are
okay
if
they
are
really
good.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
are
they
--
are
they
supposed
to
be
more
virtuous
than
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
courts
all
the
time,
you
know,
distinguish
prior
cases
by
saying,
"well,
you
know,
it
was
dictum,
or
we
didn't
really
hold
that
and
whatnot.
"
and
i
read
their
opinion
as
somewhat
the
same
--
somewhat
the
same
thing.
they
acknowledge
at
the
end,
and
that's
why
they
didn't
impose
a
fine,
that
although
this,
you
know,
nothing
that
they
had
done
up
till
now
--
although
their
staff
had
--
would
have
misled
anybody;
still
and
all,
it
wasn't
all
that
clear,
and
therefore
we
won't
impose
a
fine.
it
seems
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well
--
it
was
also,
they
said,
you
know,
we
sort
of
made
this
change
without
getting
comments
from
the
affected
parties.
justice
antonin
scalia
give
us
a
chance
to
receive
comments
and
then
--
and
then
explain.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
said
that.
they
gave
the
reason
for
their
current
belief.
they
said
even
when
it
is
used
just
as
a
swear
word
or
as
an
expletive,
the
reason
it
has
its
impact
is
precisely
because
it
refers
to
these
excretory
or
sexual
activities;
that's
what
--
that's
what
gives
--
gives
it
its
zing.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
there
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
use
golly
waddles
in
--
instead
of
the
f-word.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
thought
we've
held
that
the
court
can't
engage
in
such
expansion
of
and
additions
to
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
thought
that
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--one
of
our
landmark
decisions
that
what
it
says,
it
says,
and
we
cannot
add
additional
procedures.
you
are
suggesting
we
add
an
additional
procedure
that
when
it
deals
with
speech,
the
explanation
has
to
be
really
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
are
asking
for
a
higher
standard
than
the
apa--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
should
have
complained
to
the
lower
court
about
that.
you
should
have
said,
please
don't
decide
this
on
the
apa
issue.
this
is
a
first
amendment
case.
you
should
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
went
on
the
apa
issue,
and
then
you
come
up
here
and
say:
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
want
to
discuss
the
apa;
i
want
to
discuss,
you
know,
the
first
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
apa
simpliciter;
not
the
apa,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
does
good
stuff
now
and
then.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
these
arguments
apply
not
just
to
the
isolated,
once-upon-a-time
use,
but
even
to
continued
use.
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
just
filling
a
program
with
these
expletives,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
not,
i
suppose,
what
you
are
arguing
against
here,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
goes
pacifica.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--isn't
that
a
heckler's
veto?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
people
like,
you
know,
going
on
and
on
with
expletives
and
offensive
words?
are
those
of
us
who
are
offended
by
that
hecklers
and
you
can't
take
our
positions
into
account
because
you're
giving
effect
to
a
heckler?
i
mean
--
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
your
clients
have
had
anything
to
do
with
that?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do,
indeed,
but
you
don't
have
them
presented
as
something
that
is
--
is
normal
in
polite
company,
which
is
what
happens
when
it
comes
out
in
--
in
television
shows.
this
is
a
coarsening
of
manners
that
is
--
that
is
produced
by
--
by
the
shows.
so
i
am
--
you
know,
i
--
i
am
not
persuaded
by
the
argument
that
people
are
more
accustomed
to
hearing
these
words
than
they
were
in
the
past.
justice
antonin
scalia
more
tolerant
or
more
used
to
hearing
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
candidly,
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
ask
about
deferring
there.
you
seem
to
be
suggesting
that
since
there
is
a
criminal
penalty
for
a
violation
of
this
statute,
the
agency
has
no
role
in
--
in
defining
what
--
what
the
terms
of
the
statute
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
respondents,
fox
television
stations,
inc.
and
interveners
such
as
abc,
nbc
and
cbs
are
broadcasters
who,
along
with
their
affiliates,
have
received
licenses
from
the
federal
communications
commission
to
use
parts
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
to
distribute
their
programs.
when
these
broadcasters
accepted
their
licenses,
they
became
subject
to
certain
statutory
obligations
designed
to
protect
the
public's
interest
in
the
use
of
its
airwaves.
one
of
the
burdens
that
licensees
shoulder
is
a
statutory
ban
against
“authoring
any
indecent
language
by
means
of
radio
communication.”
congress
has
given
the
fcc
the
power
to
enforce
this
proscription
through
various
means,
and
the
fcc
has
defined
the
term
indecent
to
refer
to
“language
that
describes
in
terms
patently
offensive
as
measured
by
contemporary
community
standards
for
the
broadcast
media,
sexual
or
excretory
activities
or
organs
at
times
of
the
day
when
there
is
a
reasonable
risk
that
children
may
be
in
the
audience.”
having
first
defined
the
prohibited
speech
in
1975,
the
fcc
took
a
cautious
but
gradually
expanding
approach
to
enforcing
the
prohibition.
in
2004,
the
fcc's
golden
globes
order
declared
for
the
first
time
that
a
non-literal,
that
is
expletive
use
of,
what
we
will
call
the
f
word
or
the
s
word,
could
be
actionably
indecent
even
when
the
word
is
used
only
once.
this
case
concerns
isolated
utterances
of
the
f
and
s
words
during
two
live
broadcasts
of
the
billboard
music
awards
aired
by
fox.
each
of
which
was
viewed
by
about
2.5
million
minors.
in
the
first
broadcast
and
will
blip
it
out
here
as
the
broadcasters
can
do.
in
the
first
broadcast,
the
entertainer
cher
exclaimed,
“i've
also
had
critics
for
the
last
40
years
saying
that
i
was
on
my
way
out
every
year,
right!
so,
f
them.”
the
second
involved
presentation
of
an
award
by
nicole
richie
and
parris
hilton
who
were
principals
in
a
fox
television
series
called,
the
simple
life.
ms.
hilton
began
their
exchange
and
this
was
scripted.
by
reminding
ms.
richie
to
“watch
the
bad
language,”
ms.
richie
proceeded
to
ask
the
audience,
“why
do
they
even
call
it
the
simple
life?
have
you
ever
tried
to
get
cow
s
out
of
a
product
purse?
it's
not
so
effing
simple.”
the
fcc
found
that
both
of
these
broadcasts
were
actionably
indecent
but
declined
to
impose
any
penalties.
respondents
sought
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
challenging
both
the
adequacy
of
the
agency's
explanation
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
constitutionality
of
the
fcc's
enforcement
action.
that
court
set
aside
the
agency's
action
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
but
declined
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
we
granted
certiorari.
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
courts
may
set
aside
agency
action
that
is
arbitrary
or
capricious.
to
comply
with
this
requirement
of
reasoned
decision
making,
an
agency
must
examine
the
relevant
data
and
articulate
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
its
action.
in
overturning
the
fcc's
judgment,
the
second
circuit
relied
in
part
on
circuit
present
interpreting
the
apa,
and
our
opinion
in
--
in
a
case
called
motor
vehicle
manufacturer's
association
versus
state
farm
mutual
automobile
insurance
company,
interpreted
the
apa
in
that
case
to
require
a
more
substantial
explanation
for
changes
at
agency
policy,
then
what
would
be
required
when
the
agency
writes
on
blank
slate.
we
find
no
basis
in
the
act
or
in
this
court's
opinion
for
such
a
requirement,
although
an
agency
must
ordinarily
display
awareness
that
it
is
changing
its
position,
and
must
account
for
circumstances
such
as
reliance
interests
that
may
be
different
because
it
had
a
prior
policy.
the
agency
need
not
demonstrate
to
a
court's
satisfaction
that
the
reasons
for
the
new
policy
are
better
than
the
reasons
for
the
old
one.
it
suffices
that
the
new
policy
is
permissible
under
the
statute
that
they
are
good
reasons
for
it,
and
that
the
agency
believes
it
to
be
better,
which
the
conscious
change
adequately
indicates.under
these
standards,
the
fcc's
new
policy
and
its
order
finding
the
broadcast
here
are
actionably
indecent
or
neither
arbitrary
nor
capricious.
first,
the
fcc
forthrightly
acknowledged
that
its
recent
actions
have
broken
new
ground,
taking
account
of
inconsistent
prior
fcc
and
staff
actions,
and
explicit
disavowing
them
as
no
longer
good
law.
the
agency's
reasons
for
expanding
its
enforcement
activity
more
over
were
entirely
rational,
even
when
used
as
an
expletive.
the
f
word's
power
to
insult
and
offend
derives
from
its
sexual
meaning,
and
the
fcc's
decision
to
look
at
the
patent
offensiveness
or
even
isolated
uses
of
sexual
and
excretory
words
fits
with
the
context
based
approached
we
sanctioned
when
we
review
the
agency's
first
use
of
its
indecency
enforcement
power
in
a
case
called
fcc
versus
pacifica
foundation.
because
the
fcc's
prior
safe
harbor
for
single
words
would
likely
lead
to
more
widespread
use
of
offensive
words
and
in
light
of
technological
advances
reducing
the
cost
of
blipping
such
words
out
of
lie,
broadcasts,
it
was
rational
for
the
agency
to
step
away
from
its
old
regime.
the
fcc's
decision
not
to
impose
sanctions
moreover
precludes
any
argument
that
is
arbitrarily
punishing
parties
without
notice
of
their
action's
potential
consequences.
the
second
circuit
rested
its
holding
that
the
agency
action
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
on
three
grounds,
each
of
which
we
find
fall
short.
first,
the
second
circuit
fall
to
the
fcc
for
failing
to
provide
evidence
proving
that
fleeing
expletives
constitute
harmful
first
blows
to
children
prior
to
adopting
its
new
policy,
but
this
is
one
of
those
policy
judgments
for
which
empirical
evidence
is
difficult
to
acquire
and
cannot
be
--
and
cannot
be
required.
it
suffices
to
know
that
children
mimic
behavior
they
observe.
second,
the
court
of
appeals
falls
to
the
fcc's
policy
because
its
first
blow
theory
would
logically
require
a
categorical
band
on
all
broadcasts
of
expletives.
this
criticism
however
is
not
responsive
to
the
actual
policy
under
review
because
the
fcc
has
always
reviewed
the
harmfulness
of
various
statements
based
on
the
context
in
which
they
were
broadcasted.
the
fcc's
decision
to
retain
some
discretion
in
lesser
gratuitous
cases
does
not
invalidate
its
regulation
of
the
broadcast
here
under
review.
third,
the
second
circuit
disagreed
with
the
fcc's
prediction
that
a
per
se
exemption
for
fleeting
expletives
would
lead
to
increased
use,
but
the
agency's
judgment
on
this
matter
merits
deference
and
in
--
in
any
event
makes
an
entire
sense.
respondents'
additional
arguments
are
not
tenable
grounds
for
affirmance
either.
fox
misconstrued
the
agency's
orders
when
it
argues
that
the
old
policy
was
not
actually
a
per
se
rule
against
liability
for
isolated
expletives,
and
that
the
new
policy
is
a
presumption
of
indecency
for
certain
words.
fox
reads
more
into
our
prior
opinion
in
pacifica
than
is
there.
we
reject
respondent's
invitation
to
turn
the
sword
of
pacifica,
which
sanctions
some
regulation
into
an
administrative
law
shield
that
would
prevent
the
fcc
from
going
any
further.
and
fox's
argument
that
the
fcc's
repeated
appeal
to
context
is
actually
a
plea
for
unbridled
discretion
ignores
the
fact
that
our
opinion
in
pacifica
specifically
endures
such
a
context
based
approach.
respondents
additionally
argue
that
the
fcc's
regulation
of
their
broadcast
violates
the
first
amendment,
but
that
question
was
not
ruled
on
below
and
we
decline
to
reach
it
here
in
the
first
instance.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
have
each
filed
dissenting
opinions.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
