justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
--
can
i
ask?
you
can
go
ahead.
are
you
finished?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
have
a
practical
question.
i'm
just
curious
about
this.
what
are
the
networks
supposed
to
do,
or
the
television
stations?
they
cover
a
lot
of
live
events.
they're
not
just
sports
events.
they're
also
like
but
the
golden
--
you
know,
the
emmys,
the
oscars,
and
you
deal
with
a
cross-section
of
humanity.
and
my
experience
is
some
parts
of
that
cross-section
swear.
[laughter]
so,
what
is
it
--
what
are
they
supposed
to
do
when
the
event
is
live,
and
lo
and
behold,
they
have
a
few
people
in
front
of
them
who
swear,
using
these
words?
what
is
their
--
what
can
they
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
what
they
--
what
they
now
--
they
now
do
this?
in
other
words,
whenever
they
cover
a
baseball
game,
whenever
they
cover
anything
live,
they
have
to
have
some
kind
of
tape
system
or
for
the
emmys,
everything
is
on
tape
and
it's
all
delayed
five
seconds?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
talking
about
breaking
news
coverage.
i
guess
i'm
talking
about,
you
know,
any
one
of
--
they
cover
the
wrestling
matches,
they
cover
--
you
see
what
i'm
driving
at.
and
i
would
like
to
know
what
is
the
state
of
the
art?
you
are
saying
the
state
of
the
art
is
right
now
when
i
turn
on
my
television
set,
they
all
use
a
delay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
are
you
saying
they
all
have
to
use
a
delay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
the
fcc
explain
all
this
in
its
opinion
when
it
said,
we
understand
that
now
we're
going
to
have
to
--
every
incident
is
going
to
have
to
be
--
have
a
5-second
delay
and
they
will
have
to
have
tapes,
and
we
think
it's
worth
the
cost?
did
they
explain
all
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
see
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
review
me
to
one
thing
in
the
record
if
it's
there,
or
just
tell
me.
i
did
find
an
explanation
for
the
agency
deciding
that
"fleeting"
is
not
going
to
be
an
automatic
exemption.
they've
talked
about
that.
what
i
didn't
find
is
an
explanation
for
a
second
thing,
which
had
to
do
with
their
first
prong
of
their
former
test,
and
that
was
the
distinction
that
used
to
be
made
between
using
these
words
as
swear
words
and
using
them
as
descriptive
words.
now
that,
i
think,
showed
up
in
their
former
policy
because
they
said
if
they
were
used
as
a
swear
word
we
are
not
going
to
go
after
them,
at
least
not
immediately.
so
that
had
to
do
with
prong
1,
not
prong
2.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
there
an
explanation
why
they
made
that
change?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
hasn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
were
--
you
were
pursuing
the
practical
thing
about
the
tapes,
and
so
forth,
when
you
got
on
to
a
different
subject,
which
was
the
--
the
nature
of
the
program.
i
just
wanted
to
be
certain
you
are
finished
with
what
you
wanted
to
say
there.
i
--
because
i
am
interested
in
the
practical
question
of:
do
all
the
stations
have
tapes?
and
leave
sports
events
out
of
it,
and
leave
news
out
of
it.
are
there
other
events
that
these
small
stations
might
want
to
cover
that
don't
have
the
tape
or
that
now
don't
use
the
tape;
anything
else
you
want
to
say
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
am
interested
in
the
practical
problem
as
part
of
this.
where
do
i
look
to
find
out
some
facts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
explained
--
i
mean,
the
change
i
saw
was
that
previously
the
use
of
these
words
as
a
swear
was
treated
differently
from
the
use
of
these
words
as
a
description.
and
that
after
the
event,
it's
not
treated
differently.
