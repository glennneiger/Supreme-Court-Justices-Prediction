excuse
me.
let's
go
back
to
131
for
a
minute.
i
thought
that
applied
to
the
"accomplice"
instruction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
question
specifically
applied
to
the
defendant
only
for
the
defendant
or
his
accomplice.
justice
john

stevens
mr.
fisher,
can
i
just
ask
you
a
question?
is
it
your
view
that
the
question
that
is
troubling
the
jury
was
whether
they
had
to
find
that
the
driver
of
the
car
knew
that
there
was
a
gun
in
the
car.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
proof
of
the
gun
in
the
car
was
enough
to
prove--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
wouldn't
--
and
that's
what
presumably
may
have
taken
a
lot
of
time
deliberating
whether
or
not
he
knew
there
was
a
gun.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
one
theory
it
makes
a
difference;
in
another
theory
it
doesn't.
