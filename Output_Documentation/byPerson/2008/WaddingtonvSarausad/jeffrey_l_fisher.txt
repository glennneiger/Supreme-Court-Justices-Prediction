mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
is
here
today
making
what
we
think
is
a
rather
extraordinary
argument.
it's
arguing
that
there
is
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
in
this
case
interpreted
the
accomplice
liability
charge
in
the
same
manner
that
the
state
itself
urged
the
jury
to
interpret
it;
that
the
state
urged
the
washington
court
of
appeals
to
interpret
it
on
direct
review
in
this
case
and
in
many
other
cases,
and
how
the
washington
court
of
appeals
in
fact
interpreted
it.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right,
your
honor.
so
there
is
a
constitutional
violation,
and
then
our
burden,
which
we
believe
we
can
carry
on
the
extraordinary
record
in
this
case,
is
to
show
that
a
court,
the
washington
court
of
appeals,
could
not
have
reasonably
concluded
that
there
was
a
reasonable
likelihood
the
jury
understood
the
charge
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
justice
alito,
we
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that,
because
in
the
washington
court
of
appeals
decision,
they
start
by
laying
out
the
statutory
language
of
washington
accomplice
liability.
and
remember,
the
jury
instruction
in
this
case
simply
tracks
that
language.
that's,
in
fact,
one
of
the
state's
argument.
now,
our
response
to
that
argument
is,
just
as
you
said,
justice
alito,
when
a
state
supreme
court,
as
the
washington
court
later
did
in
this
case,
steps
in
and
applies
a
gloss
to
that
language
and
interprets
it,
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
it's
as
though
that
language
is
written
into
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
got
it
right
insofar
as
regurgitated
the
language
of
the
statute.
but
the
washington
law
that
would
apply
to
this
case
--
and
i
think
there
is
an
agreement
on
this,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
mr.
sarausad
has
to
know
that
he
was
promoting
or
facilitating
a
homicide.
that's
what
he
has
to
know.
that's
theory
one
of
the
state's--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
problem,
your
honor,
is
it
starts
with
this
court
recognized
him
void.
juries
are
lay
people,
and
they
understand
things
in
terms
of
common
sense.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
let
me
take
your
question
in
two
steps,
justice
breyer.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you.
first
i
want
to
emphasize
we
are
not
alleging
prosecutorial
misconduct
in
this
case
in
any
way.
the
problem
is--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right.
let
me
--
all
i
meant
to
say
was
the
prevailing
view
in
the
state
at
the
time
of
this
trial
was
that
any
crime
was
sufficient,
and
so
that's
why
the
prosecutor
was
entitled
to
make
that
argument.
let
me
take
your
question
in
two
steps,
first
the
ambiguity
in
the
language.
as
the
washington
courts
themselves
and
as
the
states
themselves
argue
at
page
38
and
39
of
the
appendix
of
our
red
brief,
you
can
interpret
the
language
in
the
statute,
when
you
get
to
words
"the
crime",
to
mean
one
of
two
things:
one,
it
could
mean
as
you
said,
justice
breyer,
that
the
particular
crime
the
principal
committed;
or
it
could
mean
one
could
understand
it
to
mean
simply
the
principal's
criminal
conduct.
and
in
washington--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
maybe
the
best
that
i
can
do,
justice
breyer,
is
refer
you
to
empirical
evidence
from
the
state
itself,
from
the
state
of
washington,
and
if
you
need
one
further
thing
to
look
at,
i
commend
to
you
the
supreme
court
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
that
cited
in
the
actual
brief
--
there
was
language
exactly
like
this
that
comes
to
a
textual
analysis
and
comes
to
the
conclusion.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
because
the
articles
"a"
and
"the"
are
simply
not
definite
enough.
and
you
can
read
the
words
"the
crime"
to
simply
mean
criminal
conduct.
now,
let
me
talk
about
the
prosecutor's
argument.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
if
that's
all
we
had,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
would
be
exactly
right.
so
let
me
turn
now--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--right.
right.
because
the
test
that
this
court
has
repeated
many
times
is
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
this
jury
misapplied
the
instruction.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
prosecutor's
argument,
because
there
was
a
lot
of
discussion
about
that
in
the
first
half
an
hour.
there
is
two
places
in
the
joint
appendix
that
you
might
want
to
pay
attention
to,
and
i
think
we
might
have
been
referring
to
two
different
places
earlier.
in
joint
appendix
page
38,
the
prosecutor
makes
her
opening
argument
and
says
--
and
uses
the
assault
analogy
of
holding
somebody's
arms
behind
their
back.
and
she
tells
the
jury
this
is
--
as
justice
ginsburg
was
reading
--
this
is
the
law
of
the
state
of
washington.
and
again,
in
direct
rebuttal
at
page
123
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
prosecutor
again
says
very
specifically
--
specifically
to
the
jury,
let
me
talk
to
you
about
the
accomplice
liability
instruction.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
there
were
objections
both
before
and
after.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
there
were
times
where
mr.
sarausad's
counsel,
you're
right,
did
ask
for
a
little
more
than
he
was
entitled
to.
but
mr.
reyes'
counsel
made
objections
directly
on
point,
which
mr.
sarausad
joined,
and
as
justice
ginsburg
noted
earlier,
when
the
jury
comes
back
with
the
third
question
that
is
precisely
on
point,
it's
precisely
the
question
on
which
that
whole
entire
case
turns
--
and
i
might
add
there
would
be
no
reason
for
the
jury
to
ask
that
third
question,
what
kind
of
knowledge
is
required
in
this
case,
if
they
had
decided,
as
the
state
argues,
that
mr.
sarausad
knew
a
homicide
was
going
to
be
committed.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
we
think
it's
pretty
clear,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
more
important
sentence
may
be
the
one
that
precedes
that
question,
which
is
the
jury
tells
the
court,
after
seven
days
of
deliberations:
we
are
having
difficulty
agreeing
on
the
legal
definition
and
concept
of
accomplice.
now,
that
is
the
question
--
and
let
me
return
to
the
prosecutor's
argument--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think
the
best
we
can
do,
because
we
have
to
make
reasonable
inferences
from
the
record
and
he
we
can't
go
back
and
ask
the
jurors
what
we
thought,
is
we
have
to
make,
as
the
court
has
done
many
times,
reasonable
inferences
as
to
what
they
are
doing.
and
i
think
the
fairest
reading
of
this
record,
even
if
it's
not
absolutely
clear,
is
that
the
jury
was
honing
in
progressively
on
the
central
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
was
mr.
sarausad's
mens
rea.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
your
honor,
we
are
not
challenging
--
or
this
court
does
not
have
authorities
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
so
there
might
be
enough
evidence
in
the
record
for
the
jury
to
have
found
that.
but
the
question
is,
did
the
jury
find
that?
and
we
can't
know
from
the
instructions
given
in
light
of
the
arguments
made
to
the
jury
by
the
prosecutor
and
the
jury's
own
questions
trying
to
sort
through
them,
this
case
--
whether
the
jury
actually
found
that.
and
so
if
the
state
wanted
--
this
goes
again
to
the
prosecutor's
argument.
there
is
two
things
that
i
think
we
might
be
conflating
improperly
here.
there
is
the
first
question
of
what
the
prosecutor
argued
to
the
jury
washington
law
meant.
and
i
suggest
to
you
if
you
look
at
ja
38
and
ja
123,
there
is
no
doubt
what
the
prosecutor
was
arguing
to
the
jury
washington
law
meant.
it
meant
as
she
said,
"in
or
a
dime,
in
for
a
dollar.
"
if
you
hold
somebody's
arms
behind
their
back
thinking
that
an
assault
is
going
to
occur
and
the
person
dies,
you
can
be
found
guilty
of
murder.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
both
before
and
after,
justice
kennedy.
but
i
would
add
that
another
reason
the
defense
counsel
may
not
have
interposed
yet
another
objection
at
that
instance
was
because
that
was
the
prevailing
view
of
washington
law
at
the
time.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
don't
think
so,
justice
alito
that
would
have
cleared
up
the
ambiguity
in
the
case--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
it's
not
because
what
you
did
is
you
inserted
the
name
of
the
crime
in
there.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
exactly
what
defendants
even
still
in
the
state
of
washington
are
asking
courts
to
do
in
the--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes,
under
the
particular
circumstances
in
this
case,
because
the
jury
expressed
confusion.
so
we
know
the
jury
was
confused.
we
know
the
only
reason
they
would
have
asked
that
is
if
they
had
not
found
the
facts
the
state
alleges,
at
least
at
that
point,
that
mr.
sarausad
knew
a
murder
was
going
to
occur,
and
also
because
we
know
the
prosecutor
argued
the
exact
opposite
to
them.
they
were
actually
asking
the
question
--
another
way
to
put
it,
i
think
which
is
a
fair
characterization
is,
is
what
the
prosecutor
told
us
correct?
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
you
need
more
than
that
in
this
case.
second
degree
murder
is
intentional.
so--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--intentionally
killing
is
what
the
state
says.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--the
defendant
didn't
have
to
have
premedication,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
the
best
answer
i
can
give
and
i
--
is
that
we
agree
with
the
state
on
this.
we
agree
with
what
the
state
said
at
page
31
of
its
brief,
that
it
had
to
prove
that
mr.
sarausad
knew
he
was
aiding
or
facilitating
a
homicide.
that
he
knew,
and
it
was
argued
to
this
case,
justice
--
as
it
was
argued
to
the
jury,
justice
breyer,
the
defense
agreed
that
if
mr.
sarausad
knew
there
was
a
gun
in
his
car,
or
if
he
knew
that
the
fellows
were
planning
on
killing
somebody,
that
he
could
have
been
found
guilty.
that
was
the
very
--
that
was
the
central
issue
in
this
case;
and
when
the
state
stands
up
and
says
the
prosecutor
argued
--
didn't
make
--
didn't
make
a
misleading
argument,
what
they
are
talking
about
are
the
prosecutor's
arguments
on
the
facts.
after
telling
the
jury
had
is
what
washington
law
is,
the
prosecutor
argued
in
various
ways
that
mr.
sarausad
knew
that
a
fight
was
going
to
happen,
or
--
or
that
a
gun
was--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right.
but
i
think
you
don't--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--because
when
somebody
is
punched
in
the
stomach
there
is
no
reasonable
belief
that
the
person
is
going
to
be
put
in
grave
risk
of
death.
and
so
as
i
said,
the
issue
of
this
case,
that
the
whole
entire
case
was
about,
and
that
the
jury
was
demonstrably
perplexed
about,
was
what
did
mr.
sarausad
know.
and
when
the
state
says,
well
--
the
prosecutor
argued
to
the
jury
that
he
knew
their
shooting
was
going
to
happen
or
that
he
knew
a
gun
was
in
the
car,
if
the
jury
had
believed
that
they
could
have
come
back
with
a
guilty
verdict
in
30
minutes;
but
instead
they
asked
a
series
of
questions
culminating
in
the
one
after
seven
days
of
deliberation
which
can
only
be
interpreted
as
suggesting
that
we
don't
believe
that
mr.
sarausad
knew
that
the
worst
was
going
to
happen
here,
and
we
are
struggling
to
figure
out
what
kind
of
verdict
we
have
to
render
in
light
of
that.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
a
standard
statement
to
that
effect
was
made.
but
remember
two
things,
justice
alito.
first,
the
prosecutor
herself
kept
telling
the
jury
this
is
what
the
state
of
washington
law
requires.
and
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
other
cases,
the
prosecutor
isn't
just
any
old
lawyer
standing
in
front
of
a
jury.
the
prosecutor
carries
with
her
the
imprimatur
of
the
government;
and
so
we
think
it's
perfectly
reasonable
for
the
jury
to
have
understood
the
prosecutor
to
be
arguing
this
is
what
the
law
is,
and
at
the
very
least
to
have
created
a
question
in
their
minds.
and
if
i
contrast
this
case
with
brown
against
payton,
because
justice
breyer
has
asked
about
that
case
and
it
is
another
case
where
the
prosecutor
made
what
this
court
found
was
a
misleading
argument
to
the
jury,
there
you
have
a
very
different
situation.
not
only
do
you
have
no
jury
questions
at
all
coming
in
that
case
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
the
jury
was
in
fact
confused
and
likely
to
follow
the
prosecutor's
advice,
but
you
have
a
very
different
scenario
in
brown,
where
this
court
said
that
in
light
of
the
way
that
case
was
actually
argued,
the
prosecutor
was
really
making
more
of
an
argument
on
the
facts,
that
these
arguments
the
defendant
has
made
shouldn't
really
be
considered
mitigating
evidence
in
your
deliberations;
and
as
this
court
said
the
jury
must
have
taken
it
as
a
factual
argument
because
otherwise
the
whole
mitigation
hearing
would
have
been
totally
unnecessary.
now,
under
the
--
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
way
this
case
was
tried
--
and
again
i
want
to
emphasize
that
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried,
the
prosecutor
had
the
better
of
the
argument
as
to
what
washington
law
is.
this
case
is
only
before
you
because
it's
the
oddball
case,
and
the
only
one
i
can
think
of
that's
like
it
is
when
this
court
had
in
about
2000,
or
decided
in
2001,
called
fiore
v
white,
when
in
pennsylvania
the
state
brought
a
prosecution
and
obtained
a
conviction
for
discharging
hazardous
waste
without
a
permit,
and
then
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
later
said
that
not
having
a
permit
is
required
under
the
statute.
it's
not
enough
to
prove
to
the
jury
that
he
so
deviated
from
the
permit
that
--
that
no
permit
existed.
and
then
this
court
said
once
we
know
that
clarification
under
state
law,
we
look
back
and
it's
clear
as
day
that
the
jury
didn't
find
that
element.
now
the
only
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case
is
that
in
fiore
it
was
absolutely
certain
the
jury
didn't
find
the
element
and
the
prosecution
didn't
argue
otherwise.
here
you
have
enough
ambiguous
evidence
and
ambiguity
in
the
jury
instructions
that
the
state
was
trying
to
backfill
after
it
has
lost
the
case
in
the
washington
supreme
court
and
say
no,
the
jury
in
this
case
even
though
we
told
them
they
didn't
have
to
find
it,
did
go
ahead
and
find
it.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
not
directly.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
so,
the
relevance--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right,
justice
alito
and
i
know
that
you
know
that
case.
the
--
you're
right.
so
we
are
on
all
fours
with
fiore
in
the
sense
that
the
later
decision
from
the
state
supreme
court
applies
retroactively,
and
in
fiore
what
you
would
have
had,
the
court
didn't
need
to
talk
about
jury
instructions,
because
i
take
it
that
the
jury
was
instructed
in
fiore
that
deviating
substantially
from
a
permit
satisfies
the
no-permit
element
of
that
defense,
and
so
the
jury
was
given
there,
simply
an
instruction
that
was
simply
wrong.
and
here
our
contention
is
that
the
--
that
the
jury
charge
taken
in
light
of
the
case
was
ambiguous,
but
that
distinction
doesn't
matter
because
as
this
court
has
said
in
boyde
and
estelle
and
many
other
cases,
all
you
have
to
show
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
misunderstood
the
charge.
now
we
have
to
show
an
additional
layer
of
unreasonableness
because
we
are
on
habeas
now
and
no
longer
on
direct
review,
but
for
all
the
reasons
that
are
apparent
on
the
face
of
this
record
this
is
the
extraordinary
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
there's
two
ways
to
think
about
it.
yes,
that
could
be
one
way
to
think
about
it.
the
other
way
that
they
might
have
been
thinking
about
it
was
whether
he
knew
that
a
murder
was
going
to
happen
and
that
a
killing
was
going
to
happen.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
the
way
the
case
was
presented
to
the
jury.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
the
defendant--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--precisely.
and
the
defense
counsel
--
the
defense
counsel
admitted
in
argument
that
if
you
find
he
knew
there
was
a
gun
in
the
car,
then
we
lose.
and,
remember,
the
jury
earlier
--
we've
talk
about
the
three
jury
questions
about
what
the
law
meant.
remember
the
jury
earlier
asked
to
have
mr.
sarausad's
testimony
reread
back
to
them.
so,
again,
every
indication
is
you
have
a
jury
really
trying
very,
very
hard
to
do
their
job.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it's
the
rule
that
is
stated
--
again,
at
page
32
of
the
state's
brief
with
which
we
agree
--
that
if
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
applied
instructions
so
as
to
violate
the
constitution,
then
that
violates
due
process.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
the
state
would
have
a
better
argument
if
nothing
else
had
happened
in
this
trial
other
than
simply
the
jury
had
been
given
that
instruction,
but
our
point
is,
and
then
this
court
recognizes
as
much,
i
think,
in
brown
against
payton,
that
the
prosecutor's
arguments
do
matter.
they
are
to
be
considered
in
the
calculus.
and
this
court
said
in
estelle
that
instructions
cannot
be
considered
in
isolation.
they
have
to
be
considered
in
the
totality
of
the
way
the
case
was
tried.
and
so
my
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
reason
why
the
state
cannot
show
that
the
state
court
of
appeals
decision
was
reasonable
is
because
it's
not
just
the
instruction
that
had
perplexed
the
state
and
washington
courts
over
the
years;
it's
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
asked
the
jury
to
adopt
the
wrong
interpretation
of
the
instruction
and
that
the
jury
came
back
and
told
the
court
--
i
think
--
maybe
it
helps
to
think
about
the
case
this
way:
after
seven
days
of
deliberation
--
now
i
understand
that
we
can
dispute
a
little
bit
what
the
jury
was
asking,
but
i
think
a
fair
statement
is
that
after
seven
days
of
deliberation,
the
jury
was
telling
the
court
at
a
minimum
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
we
don't
understand
accomplice
liability
in
this
case
and
that
we
are
going
to
find
that
as
long
as
sarausad
was
a
member
of
this
gang
and
willingly
participated
in
gang
activity,
that
that's
enough
to
hold
him
liable
for
accomplice
murder.
and
that's
what
the
state
had
argued
alternatively,
your
honor.
so
after
seven
days,
there's
no
guesswork
that's
even
required.
we
know
the
jury
was
confused
and
going
down
the
wrong
path.
and
so
the
only
way
the
state
can
rescue
that
is
to
say
that,
upon
being
told
to
read
the
same
charge
that
it
been
told
to
read
three
previous
times,
that
suddenly
the
light
bulb
went
off
so
dramatically
that
it
reduced
its
confusion
below
the
50/50
level.
now
that's
what
this
court
said
in
brown
against
payton.
the
reasonable
likelihood
test
is
below
50/50.
so
we
think
if
you
were
the
washington
court
of
appeals
--
and
i
think
this
is
another
way
to
ask
yourselves
the
question
you
have
to
decide
in
this
case.
if
you
were
the
washington
court
of
appeals
on
this
record,
would
it
be
reasonable
for
you
to
say
that
this
jury
was
not
even
reasonably
likely
to
misunderstand
the
accomplice
liability
instruction
in
this
case?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
we
have
all
three,
but
i
don't
want
to
give
away
too
much.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
jury's
third
question
is
perfectly
clear.
i
hedged
a
minute
to
be
frank
so
that
i
could
acknowledge
the
court's
earlier
questions
and
get
--
and
get
my
statement
out,
but
in
all
honesty,
i
think
that
the
third
jury
question
makes
it
clear
that
the
jury
is
confused.
but
we
have
--
again,
unlike
brown
against
payton,
unlike
weeks
against
angelone,
we
have
this
amazing
constellation
of
all
these
mutually--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
a
fair
characterization,
justice
breyer.
if
you
look
at
the
hypothetical
that
the
state
gives
the
jury
as
to
what
washington
law
means,
it
is
clear
that's
the
argument
they're
making.
on
the
facts
they
made
alternative
arguments.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you
very
much.
