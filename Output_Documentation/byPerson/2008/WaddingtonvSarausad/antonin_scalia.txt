justice
antonin
scalia
why
just
a
homicide?
what
was
--
what
was
the
indictment
here?
what
was
he
tried
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
suffice
or,
alternatively,
why
would
you
have
to
know
that
it
was
first
degree
murder
or
second
degree
murder?
i
don't
know
how
you
get
from
the
text
of
the
washington
statute
that
all
you
have
to
know
is
that
it
was
a
homicide?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
he
wasn't
prosecuted
for
homicide.
i
mean,
the
crimes
are
much
more
specific--
justice
antonin
scalia
--first
degree
murder,
second
degree
murder.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
that
appear
from
the
statute?
if
i
read
the
statute,
i
would
have
thought
that
you
have
to
have
knowledge
that
he
was
--
would
negligent
homicide
suffice?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that?
is
that
in
the
charge
to
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
in
the
court's
charges.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
--
hadn't
other
washington
state
courts
made
a
similar
error
in
their
interpretation
of
the
washington
statutes?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
same
--
and
hadn't
the
prosecutors
in
washington
in
misstating
the
standard
the
same
way
and
using
"in
for
a
dime,
in
for
a
dollar.
"
to
mean
precisely
the
wrong
thing,
namely
that
even
if
you
were
in
for
beating
him
up
that's
enough
for
holding
you
liable
for
homicide?
justice
antonin
scalia
including
this
one
in
an
earlier
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
reason
i
raise
it
is,
is
to
show
that
this
jury
was
obviously
perplexed
on
the
point.
it
asked
for
further
instructions
three
times
on
this
precise
point,
what
did
--
did
he
have
to
know.
and
all
the
trial
judge
did
was
say
read,
you
know,
read
my
instructions,
which
essentially
recited
the
statute.
and
what
all
of
what
you've
just
acknowledged
shows
is
that
reading
the
statute
doesn't
help
a
whole
lot.
it
doesn't
clarify.
it
doesn't,
it
doesn't
correct
any
misimpression
that
the
prosecutor
could
have
created.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
look
at
--
where
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
white?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
know,
you
are
taking
on
more
of
a
burden
than
you
have
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
objectively
unreasonable
to
say
the
opposite.
