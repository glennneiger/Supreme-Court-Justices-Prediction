justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
as
part
of
the
gang
dispute,
respondent,
cesar
sarausad,
drove
his
car
by
seattle
high
school
in
a
manner
that
allowed
one
of
his
passengers
to
shoot
and
kill
one
student
and
wound
another.
the
gunman
was
tried
for
murder.
sarausad
and
another
member
of
their
gang,
his
co-defendant,
were
tried
as
accomplices.
at
trial,
sarausad
and
the
co-defendant
testified
that
they
did
not
know
they
were
helping
the
gunman
to
commit
murder.
they
claimed
that
they
thought
that
they
were
going
to
the
high
school
just
to
provoke
a
fist
fight
with
the
rival
gang.
the
jury
was
instructed
in
the
language
of
the
relevant
washington
statute
regarding
accomplice
liability.
specifically,
the
instruction
stated
that
in
order
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
as
an
accomplice
in
the
commission
of
the
crime,
the
jury
must
find
that
the
defendant
took
certain
specified
actions
with
knowledge
that
they
would
promote
or
facilitate
the
commission
of
the
crime.
the
jury
convicted
the
gunman
of
first-degree
murder
and
sarausad
of
second-degree
murder,
but
failed
to
reach
a
verdict
as
to
their
co-defendant.
sarausad's
conviction
was
affirmed
on
direct
appeal.
then,
in
an
unrelated
criminal
case,
the
washington
supreme
court
considered
an
accomplice
liability
instruction
that
was
different
in
one
critical
respect
from
the
instruction
given
at
sarausad's
trial.
it
instructed
jury
that
knowledge
of
a
crime
was
sufficient
to
establish
accomplish
liability
for
the
crime.
the
washington
supreme
court
held
that
the
instruction
was
flawed
because
accomplish
liability
in
washington
requires
knowledge
of
the
crime
of
conviction
rather
than
just
general
knowledge
that
a
crime
may
occur.
in
state
postconviction
proceedings,
sarausad
relied
on
that
recent
washington
supreme
court
decision.
he
argue
that
his
jury
may
have
been
confused
by
the
instruction
if
received
and
may
have
thought
it
could
convict
him
for
murder
based
only
on
his
anticipation
of
a
fist
fight
with
the
rival
gang.
the
state
courts
denied
his
claim.
they
found
that
the
jury
instruction
in
his
case
was
a
proper
and
clear
statement
of
washington
law.
they
also
concluded
that
nothing
at
sarausad's
trial
could
have
led
the
jury
to
believe
that
it
could
convict
him
based
on
something
less
than
his
personal
knowledge
of
a
shooting.
in
federal
habeas
proceedings,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
a
federal
district
court's
decision
overturning
sarausad's
conviction.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
state
court
decision
affirming
sarausad's
conviction
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law.
in
the
court's
view,
the
accomplice
liability
instruction
used
at
sarausad's
trial
were
ambiguous
and
may
have
misinterpreted
in
a
way
to
permit
conviction
based
on
knowledge
of
an
assault
rather
than
the
shooting.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
under
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
(aedpa),
federal
courts
must
give
substantial
deference
to
state
court
decisions
upholding
criminal
convictions.
therefore,
federal
habeas
relief
is
available
only
where
the
state
court's
application
of
federal
law
was
objectively
unreasonable.
under
our
president
to
challenge
a
conviction
based
on
a
jury
instruction,
a
defendant
must
show,
one,
that
the
instruction
is
ambiguous,
and
two,
that
there
was
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
misapplied
it.
the
state
court
was
not
unreasonable
when
it
found
that
neither
requirement
was
established
in
this
case.
the
instruction
quoted
the
state
statute
verbatim.
by
its
terms,
the
instruction
required
that
accomplice
liability
for
the
crime
be
based
on
knowledge
of
the
crime
not
a
crime.
the
state
court
reasonably
concluded
that
there
was
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
misunderstood
that
instruction.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
