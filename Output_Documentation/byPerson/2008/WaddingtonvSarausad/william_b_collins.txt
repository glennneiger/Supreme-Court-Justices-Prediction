mr.
william
b.
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
before
the
court
under
the
deferential
standard
of
review
of
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act.
the
ninth
circuit
decision
should
be
reversed
because
the
washington
court's
adjudication
of
this
matter
was
not
objectively
unreasonable.
the
washington
court
concluded
that
the
instruction
at
issue
properly
informed
the
jury
of
the
elements
of
accomplice
liability,
and
the
prosecutor's
argument
informed
the
jury
that
it
could
only
convict
sarausad
if
he
acted
with
knowledge
he
was
facilitating
the
commission
of
a
homicide.
the
court
also
concluded
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
abuse
his
discretion
in
directing
the
jury
to
reread
the
relevant
instructions
instead
of
giving
the
supplemental
instruction
proposed
by
sarausad.
the
decision
below
was
not
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law.
mr.
william
b.
collins
i
do
think
it
was
right,
your
honor,
but
i
also
believe
that
it
was
not
objectively
unreasonable,
which
is
the
standard
before
this
court.
turning
to
the
prp
court's
adjudication,
the--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--i
believe
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
you
have
to
have
knowledge
that
you're
facilitating
--
you
have
to
act
and
you
have
to
have
knowledge,
both
those
two
points.
mr.
william
b.
collins
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
the
model
--
i
think
the
model
penal
code
refers
--
uses
the
term
"purpose"
as
opposed
to
"knowledge",
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
i
believe
that
you
would
have
to
have
--
you
have
to
knowingly
facilitate
the
crime,
your
honor.
that's
the--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--i'm
not
sure
there
is
much
of
a
difference,
your
honor.
frankly,
i
haven't
thought
about
that
question,
but
i
think
you
have
to
have
that
mental
component.
you
have
to
either
have
purpose
or
you
have
to
do
it
with
knowledge.
mr.
william
b.
collins
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
you
have
to
know
--
you
have
to
act
with
knowledge
that
you
are
facilitating
a
homicide.
mr.
william
b.
collins
first
degree
--
a
number
of
counts,
your
honor.
first
degree
murder,
second
degree
murder,
attempted
first
degree
murder,
first
degree
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon,
because
there
was
one
death
and
two
people
were
shot
--
wounded
and
then
there
was--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--because
the
statute
refers
to
"the
crime",
so
you
have
to
have
knowledge
that
you're
facilitating
a
homicide,
but
you
don't
have
to
have
shared--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--in
washington,
you
have
to
have
knowledge
of
the
general
crime
that
is
homicide,
but
you
don't
have
to
have
the
same
knowledge
as
to
principle;
therefore,
you
don't
have
to
have
knowledge
of
premediation.
you
just
have
to
have
knowledge
that
you're
going
to
commit
the
general
--
the
general
crime.
mr.
william
b.
collins
you
could
be
convicted
of
manslaughter
as
an
accomplice
if
you
had
knowledge
of
a
homicide.
you
have
to
have
general
knowledge
of
the
crime.
let
me
give
you
another
example.
in
the
davis
case,
for
example,
this
was
a
robbery
case,
and
the
defendants
agreed
to
do
a
robbery,
but
the
person
who
went
into
the
store
had
a
gun.
the
accomplice
didn't
know
that
he
had
a
gun,
but
still
he
was
convicted
of
armed
robbery
because
he
had
a
general
knowledge
that
robbery
was
going
to
be
committed.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
principal
had
shot
the
store
owner,
the
defendant
would
not
be
an
accomplice
to
murder
if
his
only
knowledge
was
that
he
was
facilitating
the
crime
of
robbery.
so
you
have
to
have
knowledge
that
you're
facilitating
the
general
crime
charged.
in
this
case
crimes
charged
were
various
kinds
of
homicides,
first
degree
murder,
attempted
murder.
and
in
this
case,
the
record
is
very
clear
that
the
prosecutor
argued
that
mr.
sarausad
acted
with
knowledge
that
he
was
facilitating
a
homicide.
therefore,
the
prp
court's
adjudication
of
that
point
is
not
objectively
unreasonable
under
the
aedpa
standard.
mr.
william
b.
collins
your
honor--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--your
honor,
the
prosecutor
continually
talked
about
the
fact
that
they
were
going
there
for
a
shooting.
for
example,
in
the
--
the
joint
appendix,
the
brown
brief
on
page
123,
the
prosecutor
tells
the
jury
when
they
rode
down
to
ballard
high
school
the
last
time,
"i
say
they
knew
what
they
were
up
to.
"
"fists
didn't
work.
"
"pushing
didn't
work.
"
"shouting
insults
didn't
work.
"
"shooting
was
going
to
work.
"
"in
for
a
dime,
in
for
a
dollar.
"
mr.
william
b.
collins
i
disagree,
your
honor.
when
the
prosecutor
used
the
hypothetical,
and
in
fact
on
page
123
that
i
just
quoted
you,
the
prosecutor
talks
about,
in
fact
uses
that
dime
for
a
dollar
hypothetical,
and
then
immediately
tells
the
jury
that
mr.
sarausad
acted
with
knowledge
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
homicide.
they
went--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--i'm
sorry.
are
you
talking
about
a
different
case,
a
case
other
than
this,
justice
souter?
mr.
william
b.
collins
the
court,
the
prp
court
of
appeals
said
that
that
hypothetical
is
problematic.
mr.
william
b.
collins
justice
ginsburg,
the
hypothetical
may
be
problematic,
but
you
have
to
consider--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--justice
ginsburg,
the
prosecutor's
argument
responds
to
the
argument
made
by
sarausad's
counsel
that
you
had
to
have
shared
intent,
that
mr.
sarausad
had
to
have
the
same
intent
as
the
principal.
they
do
use
the
hypothetical
about
holding
the
arms,
but
as
soon
as
they
finish
the
hypothetical
the
court
--
the
prosecutor
identifies
what
happened
here,
which
is
that
the
intention
was
to
facilitate
a
homicide,
and
you
have
to
take
the
argument
as
a
whole
just
looking
at
the
hypothetical.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
in
this
case
my
argument
doesn't
have
to
turn
on
that.
the
question
is
whether
this
is
an
unreasonable
application
and
looking
at
the
whole
argument
that
the
prosecutor
made,
whenever
the
prosecutor
used
"dime
for
a
dollar"
or
that
hypothetical,
the
prosecutor
tied
that
to
shooting.
mr.
sarausad
was
going
to--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
prosecutor
always
tied
it
to
shooting,
and
moreover
that's
the
way
the
defense
counsel
argued
the
case.
mr.
william
b.
collins
well,
your
honor,
brown
v.
payton,
which
involved
the
factor
k
in
how
you
consider
mitigating
evidence
in
the--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--he
didn't
get
them
too
mixed
up
so.
mr.
william
b.
collins
exactly.
particularly--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--your
honor,
the
intermediate
appellate
court
did
get
it
wrong
the
first
time
around.
but
i
think
you
have
to
consider
the
context,
your
honor.
the
legal
issue
before
the
appellate
court
the
first
time
on
accomplice
liability
was
mr.
sarausad's
claim
that
there
had
to
be
a
shared
intent,
that
is
to
say
you
didn't
have
to
know
the
crime.
you
had
to
have--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--your
honor,
i
think
you
have
to
consider
the
context
of
the
case.
the
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
considering
on
direct
review
was
not
the
argument
here.
the
question,
the
point
that
you're
looking
at
where
the
court
said
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
prove
shooting,
the
issue
before
the
court
was
mr.
sarausad's
claim
that
he
was
merely
present,
that
he
didn't
do
anything.
and
the
court
of
appeals
responded
by
saying
no,
there
is
evidence
that
you
may
have
known
of
the
fight,
you
may
have
known
of
the
shooting.
and
then
in
what
i
would
characterize
as
an
aside,
the
court
said
the
state
doesn't
have
to
prove
shooting,
but
there
is
evidence
of
shooting.
mr.
william
b.
collins
a
few,
a
few
court
of
appeals
decisions
did
misstate
the
standard,
justice
scalia,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
b.
collins
some
prosecutors
made
that
argument,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
b.
collins
that's
right.
but
in
boyde
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
fact
that
prosecutors
in
other
cases
made
improper
arguments
--
in
boyde
prosecutors
were
arguing
about
factor
k
didn't
allow
consideration
of
mitigation
evidence.
mr.
william
b.
collins
justice
scalia,
with
respect,
i
disagree
that
the
same
question
was
asked
three
times.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
progression
of
the
questions,
you
can
see
the
progress
of
the
deliberations.
the
first
question
asks
about
intent
with
regard
to
the
two
convict
instructions
11
and
12.
mr.
william
b.
collins
that
would
be
at
ja
131
and
132.
mr.
william
b.
collins
i'm
sorry.
the
brown
joint
appendix
131,
132.
and
see
"request
clarification
on
instruction
nos.
"
"11
and
12,
intent.
"
now,
11
and
12
are
the
two
mr.
recuenco
and
mr.
sarausad.
the
next
questions
that
were
asked
--
this
is
on
page
135
of
the
same
document
--
they
ask
about
instruction
no.
17.
mr.
william
b.
collins
the
trial
court
directed
the--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--they
asked
about
"accomplice",
but
the
--
this
was
not
a
question
about
the
meaning
of
"accomplice
liability".
this
question
is
different
than
the
third
question.
mr.
william
b.
collins
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
this
question
really
goes
to
if
you
look--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--your
honor
--
it
is
an
intent
question,
your
honor.
but
the
question,
if
you
look
at
instruction
no.
12,
which
is
on
page
--
page
--
on
page
9
of
the
brown
book,
this
talks
about
the
fact
that
in
paragraph
2,
that
the
defendant
or
his
accomplice
acted
with
intent
to
cause
the
death
of
another
person.
so
the
question
was:
did
both
--
do
you
have
to
have
the
same
intent
as
--
does
the
accomplice
have
to
have
the
same
intent
as
the
principal?
mr.
william
b.
collins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
and
that,
justice
ginsburg
--
and
that's
the
first
time
that
the
jury
asked
that
question.
the
trial
court
referred
them
to
the
accomplice
liability
instruction
and
the
knowledge
--
and
the
knowledge
instruction
and--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--and
that
would
have
been
wrong,
your
honor.
if
--
if
the
trial
judge
--
there
are
two
things
wrong
with
that
--
wrong,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
it
would
not
have
been
accurate
because
you
don't
know
what
the
group
activity
is,
and
you
don't
know
what
the
knowledge
is.
if
the
knowledge
of
the
group
activity
was
going
back
to
the
school
to
facilitate
a
crime--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
to
know
what
the
group
activity
is.
more
--
but
the
important
point
is:
the
jury
got
the
answer
to
the
question
and--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--your
honor,
i
think
in
the
weeks
case
this
court
has
held
that
it's
proper
to
tell
a
jury
to
reread
instructions.
they
are
not
required
to
give
a
supplemental
instruction.
mr.
william
b.
collins
your
honor,
we
are
not
arguing
that
there
couldn't
be
some
ambiguity,
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
adjudication
by
the
prp
court
was
not
objectively
unreasonable.
because
when
you
look
at
the
instructions
as
a
whole
and
the
argument
as
a
whole
and
the
evidence
as
a
whole,
the
prp
court's
decision
is
not
objectively
unreasonable.
mr.
william
b.
collins
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
it's
not
objectively
unreasonable.
mr.
william
b.
collins
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
there
is
no
question
that
in
a
number
of--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--i
mean
the
"opposite
position"
is
it's
possible
that
if
you
are--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--and
i
would
say
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
collins
that's
exactly
right,
chief
justice
roberts.
mr.
william
b.
collins
we
would
say
he
cannot
win
because
the
decision
of
the
washington
court
was
not
objectively
unreasonable.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
william
b.
collins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
just
focus
for
a
moment
on
the
third
question
because
respondent
focuses
on
that.
to
begin
with,
you
have
to
understand
what
was
going
on
in
this
trial.
there
was
deliberation
for
seven-plus
days
but
it
was
a
10-day
trial,
i
mean
the
jury
heard
testimony
for
10
days.
there
were
three
defendants
being
tried
together.
each
defendant
was
being
tried
on
five
counts.
it
was
a
complicated
trial.
the
fact
that
the
deliberations
took
seven
days
is
not
extraordinary
at
all.
mr.
sarausad
assumes
that
the
third
question
is
directed
at
him.
i
suggest
--
of
course
we
don't
know
what
was
going
on
in
the
jury
room,
but
i
suggest
as
likely
an
explanation
is
that
question
went
to
mr.
reyes
because
mr.
reyes
was
not
driving,
was
sitting
in
the
back
seat.
the
question
is,
if
you're
just
sitting
in
the
back
seat
when
your
gang
is
going
to
do
an
activity,
are
you
guilty?
and
they
were
told
to
reread
the
instruction.
they
did
reread
the
instruction,
and
they
deliberated.
so
the
third
question
came
on
the
seventh
day
of
deliberation.
after
they
got
the
answer
to
reread
the
instruction,
they
deliberated
about
45
minutes.
they
took
a
break
for
the
night.
they
came
back,
deliberated
about
another
hour
and
a
half,
and
then
they
pronounced
their
verdict,
convicted
mr.
ronquillo
of
first
degree
murder,
mr.
sarausad
of
second
degree
murder.
they
hung
on
mr.
reyes.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
third
question
does
not
--
is
not
some
kind
of
a
smoking
gun.
when
you
look
at
the
trial--
mr.
william
b.
collins
--exactly
right,
justice
ginsburg,
but
mr.
sarausad
assumes
that
that's
a
question
about
him.
we
suggest
it's
just
as
likely
that
it's
a
question
about
mr.
reyes.
mr.
william
b.
collins
my
response,
your
honor,
is
you
will
not
find
that
when
you
look
through
the
record.
the
prosecutor
--
and
the
prp
court
stated
the
prosecutor
never
argued
that
if
the
only
knowledge
was
some
kind
of
a
fight,
that
you
could
convict
him,
because
the
defendants
in
this
case
testified
that
they
were
going
to
go
fight.
and
you
never
had
the
prosecutor
saying:
this
is
an
easy
case;
i
win.
the
defendants
have
all
testified
that
they
were
going
to
go
fight.
in
for
a
dime,
in
for
a
dollar.
if
they
were
going
to
go
fight,
they're
guilty.
never
argued
that.
you
will
not
find
that
in
the
transcript
or
in
the
materials,
justice
breyer.
what
you
will
find
is
the
prosecutor
consistently
arguing
they
knew
they
were
going
to
facilitate
a
homicide,
a
shooting,
a
murder.
and
given
that
this
is
a
case
brought
under
aedpa
and
the
question
is
whether
the
prp
court's
decision
is
an
unreasonable
application
of
federal
law,
i
don't

there's
any
doubt
that
it's
not
an
unreasonable
application,
and,
therefore,
this
court
should
reverse
the
ninth
circuit.
if
there
are
no
more
questions.
