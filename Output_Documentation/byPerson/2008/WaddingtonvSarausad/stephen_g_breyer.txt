justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
help
me
with
this?
suppose
i'm
a
trial
judge
and
i
instruct
the
jury
in
a
technical
matter,
an
important
but
technical
matter,
and
when
they
have
questions
about
it
i
say
read
the
instruction.
suppose
i'm
right
as
far
as
the
instruction
goes.
but
say
the
prosecutor
gets
everybody
mixed
up.
now,
i
guess
if
the
prosecutor
gets
people
mixed
up
enough,
that
could
becomes
a
due
process
violation.
but
i
suspect
that
it
has
to
be
quite
a
lot
of
mix-up,
that
intuitively
is
what
i
suspect.
are
there
any
cases
i
should
look
at,
one
that
would
tell
me
how
mixed
up
the
prosecutor
has
to
get
everybody
before
it's
a
due
process
violation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
brown,
in
that
case
did
they
find
that
he
did
get
them
too
mixed
up
or
he
didn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
did
not.
so
unless
in
this
case
the
prosecutor
got
everybody
more
mixed
up
than
in
the
brown
case,
we
should
just
reverse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
what
the
instruction
said.
my
problem
is,
i
guess
different
people,
i
understand,
can
read
the
same
words
and
come
to
different
conclusions.
but
i
have
read
the
instruction
and
the
statute,
probably
over
a
dozen
times
by
now,
and
i
can't
find
the
slightest
ambiguity.
it
seems
to
be
absolutely
clear.
what
it
says
is
you're
instructed
that
a
person
is
guilty
--
i
would
say
what
crime
is
the
jury
considering
--
of
a
crime.
namely,
second-degree
murder
crime,
if
it
is
committed
by
another
person
for
which
he
is
legally
accountable.
then
it
says
you're
an
accomplice
--
an
accomplice
--
it
says
a
person
is
an
accomplice
with
certain
knowledge
when
he
aids
another
person
in
planning
or
committing
a
crime;
the
crime,
second-degree
murder.
what
is
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
different
argument.
i
want
to
know
first
--
in
my
mind
in
two
different
categories.
category
one:
is
there
an
ambiguity
in
this
instruction?
and
my
answer
so
far,
which
is
what
i
was
asking
you,
is
zero.
why
not?
and
then
the
second
question
is,
could
the
prosecution
get
people
so
mixed
up
about
something,
a
typical
thing
like
this,
that
it
would
violate
due
process?
that's
why
i
asked
the
question
before.
and
i
said,
obviously
the
answer
is
sometimes
they
could.
and
then
the
question
is,
did
they
here?
and
what
he
referred
me
to
was
brown,
which
i've
looked
at,
in
which
i
said
the
prosecutorial
and
problem
in
that
case
did
not
rise
to
a
federal
due
process
question.
so,
i
guess
--
though
it's
only
one
person
--
you
would
have
to
convince
me
that
this
is
somehow
worse
prosecutorial
conduct
than
existed
in
brown.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
my
questions
from
the
whole
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
but
what
i
mean
by
that
is
that
the
prosecution
would
have
had
to
have
gotten
the
jury
more
mixed
up
than
--
i
was
using
shorthand
for
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--more
mixed
up
than
they
did
in
brown,
where
i
thought
it
was
pretty
bad.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
my
--
it
it
doesn't
mean
either.
it
means
jury
you
are
instructed
that
the
person
is
guilty
of
a
crime
--
in
other
words,
the
jury
is
sitting
there
and
they
are
asked
the
question:
is
the
person
guilty
of
second-degree
murder?
now
they
are
to
apply
the
instruction.
a
person
is
guilty
of
second-degree
murder
if
da,
da,
da,
da.
and
when
it
gets
to
"the
crime",
it
is
referring
to
second-degree
murder.
i
don't
know
how
--
anything
else
it
could
be
referring
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
convincing
me
that
different
people
can
reach
different
conclusions.
what
i'd
like
you
to
say
is
something
that
would
change
my
mind
on
my
initial
conclusion
that
there
is
no
ambiguity.
i
think
you
could
say
something
like
that,
because
as
you
quite
rightly
point
out,
other
people
have
reached
other
conclusions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
then,
what
i
take
is
authoritative
on
that
are
two
sentences
from
the
washington
supreme
court
opinion,
though
people
--
other
judges
have
been
all
over
the
lot.
the
first
sentence
it
says:
the
trial
court
correctly
instructed
the
jury
that
it
could
convict
mr.
sarausad
of
murder
--
they
mean
second-degree
murder
--
as
an
accomplice
only
if
it
found
he
knowingly
aided
in
commission
of
"the
crime"
charged,
which
was
second-degree
murder.
that's
their
interpretation,
which
i
could
understand.
then
the
second
thing
is,
it
does
not
offend
the
principles
of
accomplice
liability
to
hold
responsible
one
who
knowingly
aids
such
conduct;
namely,
conduct
that
creates
a
substantial
risk
of
death
when
the
substantial
risk
of
death
results
in
actual
death.
so
that
would
seem
to
be
hornbook
law.
if
you
engage
in
conduct
that
might
well
cause
substantial
or
--
substantial
risk
of
death
and
you
know
it,
you
know,
you
know
you're
engaging
in
this
conduct,
that's
the
washington
view,
that's
it.
you've
had
it.
and
here
they
go
on
to
say
that
he
knew
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
that
he
knew
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
drive-by
shooting.
and
then
to
put
every
dot
on
every
"i",
they
say
a
drive-by
shooting
does
run
a
substantial
risk
of
death.
okay.
now
that's
what
i
read
and
at
that
point,
i
said
i'll
ask
you
that,
because
then
i
can
hear
the
best
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
prosecutor,
i
mean
i
thought,
though
i'm
not
--
this
really
is
ambiguous,
i
think,
but
if
you
do
hold
somebody's
arms
behind
his
back
and
punch
him
in
the
stomach,
that
does
perhaps
--
at
least
might
run
--
i
can
see
a
person
saying
that
that
runs
a
substantial
risk
of
death.
i
mean
houdini
died
that
way,
apparently.
so
maybe
hitting
somebody
in
the
stomach
does
create
a
substantial
risk
of
death.
do
you
know
anything
about
--
one
way
or
the
other
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
intentionally
hit
somebody
in
the
stomach,
you
say,
knowing
all
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
realize
that
but
what
the
state
supreme
court
holds.
i
think
correctly,
that
if
the
person
conscious
of
the
risk
knows
that
a
particular
individual
is
engaging
in
certain
conduct
for
whom
he
is
responsible,
he
is
--
he
is
guilty
of
the
--
if
the
event
that
you
know
there
is
a
substantial
risk
of
comes
about.
i
would
be
amazed
that
a
state
would
say
the
contrary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
washington
--
in
the
state
of
washington
you
think
the
law
is
that
if
joe
jones
helps
dead
eye
dick
shoot
his
gun
right
at
somebody's
leg
and
then
accidental
--
then,
you
know,
he
doesn't
aim
quite
right,
the
guy
dies;
then
it's
a
good
defense
to
say
well,
i
knew
he
was
dead
eye
dick.
i
thought
he'd
just
hit
him
in
the
leg.
i
mean,
that
--
we
know
that
isn't
a
good
defense
in
washington
because
the
supreme
court
of
washington
tells
us
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
punching
him
in
the
stomach?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
argument
--
i'm
beginning
to
get
your
argument.
the
statement
is
--
the
prosecutor
never
suggested
mr.
sarausad
could
be
found
guilty
if
he
had
no
knowledge
that
a
shooting
was
to
occur.
you're
saying
that's
absolutely
wrong.
there's
no
support
for
that
in
the
record.
in
fact
what
the
prosecutor
was
arguing
is
that,
even
if
a
shooting
didn't
occur,
he's
still
guilty
because
of
other
gang
activity,
and
when
we
read
the
record,
we
find
that's
so
wrong
the
statement
in
the
supreme
court
opinion,
that
habeas
was
right.
is
that
the
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
he's
saying,
i
think
now,
is
if
there
was
no
gun
in
the
car
--
suppose
the
jury
thinks
there's
no
gun
in
the
car,
then
he
didn't
even
know
there
was
going
to
be
a
shooting,
but
that
the
prosecutor
in
the
context
of
the
trial
had
given
the
jury
the
impression
that
they
could
convict
this
person
even
if
the
person
did
not
know
there
was
going
to
be
a
drive-by
shooting.
and
he's
saying
that
the
finding
to
the
contrary,
the
statement
to
the
contrary
in
the
supreme
court
of
washington
is
wrong.
when
i
look
at
that,
i
will
find,
he
says,
that
the
prosecutor
gave
the
impression,
as
i
just
said,
that
even
without
a
gun
your
involvement
with
this
gang
is
enough
to
convict
him
of
murder.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
you
know
the
record.
i
don't.
