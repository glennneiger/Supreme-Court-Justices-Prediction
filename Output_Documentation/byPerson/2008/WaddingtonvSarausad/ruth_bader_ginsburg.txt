justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
question
is
knowledge
of
what.
and
i
thought
it
is
now
recognized
that
in
this
state
you
have
to
know
not
just
that
a
crime
--
you
have
to
know
in
this
case
of
the
potential
for
a
homicide.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
--
the
prosecutor's
charge
--
the
prosecutor's
charge
was
just
filled
with
the
suggestion
that
as
long
as
it
was
a
crime,
that
was
sufficient.
i
don't
find
that
what
you've
said
is
an
accurate
description
of
the
charge--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
the
prosecutor's
summation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
instruction
that
follows
the
hypothetical,
first
the
statement
that
the
person
gets
assaulted,
gets
killed,
in
for
a
dime,
in
for
a
dollar?
the
law
in
the
state
of
washington
says
if
you're
in
for
a
dime
you're
in
for
a
dollar;
if
you're
there
or
even
if
you're
not
there
and
you're
helping
in
some
fashion
to
bring
about
this
crime,
you
are
just
as
guilty,
in
some
fashion.
and
that
was
tied
in
to
the
person
who
thought
he
was
assisting
in
assault
and
it
turns
out
that
the
victim
got
killed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the
statement
i
just
read,
that
the
law
of
the
state
is
you
don't
even
have
to
be
there
if
you're
helping
in
some
fashion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
it's
in
the
same
paragraph,
the
paragraph
with
the
example
of
the
accomplice
who
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--no.
this
is
in
the
summation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
appellate
court?
i
mean,
the
first
time
around
the
appellate
court
was
as
mixed
up,
more
so
perhaps,
than
the
prosecutor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
the
appellate
court
the
first
time
got
it
wrong
and
it
thought
it
was
enough
that
the
defendant
knew
that
a
crime
was
likely
to
be
committed,
not
the
crime,
crime
specified
in
the
indictment,
not
--
not
murder
one,
attempted
murder,
et
cetera,
just
a
crime.
and
the
second
time
around
that
appellate
court
said,
yeah,
we
got
it
wrong,
now
we
know
we
got
it
wrong
because
there
has
been
an
intervening
decision
of
the
state's
supreme
court
clarifying
it.
but
what
the
prosecutor
said,
at
least
as
i
read
it,
more
than
once
is
exactly
what
the
intermediate
appellate
court
said
the
first
time
around:
said
he
didn't
have
to
know
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
shooting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
say,
the
court
itself
said:
we
got
it
wrong.
we
said
go
away
appellant
because
you
knew
that
a
crime
was
likely
to
be
committed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
so.
let's
go
to
the
third
question,
when
the
jury
asks:
"when
a
person
willingly
participates
in
a
group
activity,
is
that
person
an
accomplice
to
any
crime
committed
by
anyone
in
the
group?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
the
jury
better
express
its
puzzlement?
it
wanted
to
know,
if
someone
participates
in
a
group,
but
did
not
--
that
that
person
is
--
is
an
accomplice
to
any
crime
by
anyone?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
--
the
counsel
for
the
defense
says,
tell
them
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
says
"a
group
activity".
when
a
person
willingly
participates
in
"a
group
activity",
is
that
person
an
accomplice
to
any
crime
committed
by
anyone
in
the
group?
i
don't
think
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
didn't
get
an
answer.
they
were
told
to
read
an
instruction
that
they
had
been
told
three
times
to
read
and
obviously
didn't
understand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
already
know
that
many
people,
prosecutors,
justices,
misunderstood
this
"a
crime".
was
it
"a
crime",
or
"any
crime".
or
"the
crime"?
so
i
think
you
can't
avoid
the
confusing
nature
of
the
statute
and
the
charge,
which
repeated
the
statute.
it
doesn't
get
clarified
until
the
washington
supreme
court
says
it
means
"the
crime",
not
"a
crime",
and
not
"any
crime".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
didn't
say
anything
at
all
about
mr.
reyes.
they
asked
the
question
about
an
accomplice,
a
crime.
