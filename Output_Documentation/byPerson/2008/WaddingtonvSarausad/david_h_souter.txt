justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
isn't
the
problem
on
your
side
of
the
case
that
there
was
another
"in
for
a
dime,
in
for
a
dollar.
"
argument
and
that
was
the
hypothetical
holding
the
hands
behind
the
back
while
some
third
party
slugged
the
victim?
and
on
that
hypothetical,
there
was
no
reference
to
a
definite
crime.
in
that
hypothetical
the
victim
was
killed,
and
under
that
hypothetical,
there
was
no
reference
to
the
crime,
i.e.,
homicide,
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
prosecutor's
arguments,
the
dime-dollar
arguments,
went
both
ways.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
in
that
case.
but
there
was
another
one
in
which
the
prosecutor
didn't
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
did
--
maybe
i
dreamed
this.
i
thought
the
prosecutor
also
gave
as
a
dime
for
a
dollar
example
the
example
of
the
individual,
the
accomplice
who
holds
a
victim's
hands
while
a
third
party
slugs
the
victim
and
in
fact
kills
the
victim.
and
i
thought
in
that
hypothetical
argument
the
prosecutor
was
saying
that
the
--
that
the
accomplice
was
an
accomplice
to
homicide,
even
though
he
didn't
know
at
the
time
the
assault
started
that
homicide
was
intended
or
would
result.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
take
the
argument
as
a
whole
you've
got
at
best
an
ambiguous
argument.
you've
got
an
argument
that
points
to
a
"the
crime"
interpretation
and
you've
got
an
argument
part
of
which
points
to
an
"any
crime"
interpretation,
and
to
the
extent
that
your
case
may
ultimately
turn
on
the
significance
of
the
prosecutor's
argument,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
goes
to
the
defendant.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
i'm
beating
a
dead
horse,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we've
brought
in
our
questions
from
the
bench
is
that
that
is
not
correct.
in
one
instance
the
prosecutor
clearly
tied
it
to
shooting.
if
that's
all
we
had
before
us
we
wouldn't
have
an
argument.
but
in
the
other
iteration
of
the
dime-dollar
argument,
the
prosecutor
didn't
tie
it
to
shooting.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
excuse
me.
da
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
i
mean
"the"
and
"a"
are
references
to
what
the
accomplice
had
in
mind
at
the
time
of
acting.
that's
an
intent
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
--
isn't
the
argument
for
objective
unreasonableness,
number
one,
to
begin
with,
what
you
just
stated.
of
course,
there
is
some
ambiguity
there.
i'll
be
candid
to
say
that
if
i
were
stating
it
myself,
i
would
say
there
is
more
than
some
ambiguity
here.
it
seems
to
be,
if
not
misleading,
at
least
incapable
of
informing
a
jury
of
exactly
what
the
law
is.
number
two,
the
--
the
second
point
in
the
argument
is,
the
jury
comes
back
repeatedly,
and
although,
as
you
point
out,
it
is
--
it
may
well
be
a
proper
answer
to
a
jury
request
for
clarification
to
say,
go
back
and
read
the
instruction;
the
answer
is
there.
when
it
has
been
demonstrated
by
repeated
jury
questions
that
they
are
just
not
getting
it,
that
they
still
have
perplexity,
the
court
has
got
to
do
something
more
than
just
say,
oh,
go
back
and
do
it
again.
and
number
three,
in
this
situation
in
which
there
is
ambiguity,
there
is
a
demonstration
of
jury
confusion.
there
is
an
argument
by
the
prosecutor
which,
in
fact,
is
a
two-part
argument
or
a
two-example
argument
and
it
cuts
both
ways,
isn't
it
objectively
reasonable
to
say
under
those
circumstances
that
there
was
an
inadequate
instruction
to
the
jury
in
--
in
the
correct
washington
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
--
then
what
would
it
take?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
could
say,
yes,
it
would
be
reasonable
to
say
that,
but
it
would
also
be
reasonable
to
say
--
to
say
otherwise,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
--
the
"opposite"
in
this
case
would
mean
that
the
jury
was
properly
instructed
and
was
in
a
position
adequately
to
understand
washington
law
correctly?
that's
the
--
that's
the
opposite
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
want
to
know
what
you
mean.
that's
what
you
mean
by
the
"opposite
position"?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
--
you
are
saying
you
want
--
why
don't
you
answer
my
question?
my
question
is:
i
think
you're
telling
me
that
it
would
be
objectively
reasonable
to
say
that
on
the
scenario
i
just
laid
out
the
jury
probably
understood
washington
law
correctly.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
way
would
be
the
way
we
just
set
out,
wasn't
it:
that
the
jury,
if
--
if
--
if,
in
fact,
it's
objectively
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
jury
did
understand
washington
law
correctly
on
those
circumstances,
then
--
then
the
--
the
respondent
here
cannot
win
in
--
in
his
collateral
attack?
