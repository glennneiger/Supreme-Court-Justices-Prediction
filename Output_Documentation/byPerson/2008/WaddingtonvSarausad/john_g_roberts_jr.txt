chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
07-772,
waddington
v.
sarausad.
mr.
collins.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
think
it
was
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
--
your
point
is
that
it
doesn't
go
to
the
"aiding"
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
even,
again,
i
think
you
are
taking
on
too
high
a
burden.
you
don't
have
to
show
that
the
jury
properly
understood
it.
you
don't
even
have
to
show
that
it's
reasonable.
you
have
to
show
the
opposite
--
or
your
friend
has
to
show
the
opposite,
that
there
is
no
way
that
the
jury
could
have
understood
this
correctly
or
applied
the
correct
constitutional
law.
that
is,
if
there
is
a
way,
then
it's
--
it's
not
objectively
unreasonable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
but
is
that
the
standard?
you
said
there
is
--
they
are
saying
that
it's
not
reasonably
likely,
but
that's
not
the
standard.
they
have
--
you
have
to
show
that
it's
objectively
unreasonable
to
show
that
the
--
to
assume
that
the
state
got
it
correct.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
might
be
able
to
and
you
might
--
as
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier,
you
could
read
it
one
way
or
you
could
say
it
another
way.
and
if
that's
the
case,
it's
hard
to
say
that
reading
it
one
way
is
objectively
unreasonable
when
the
state
court
reads
it
that
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
is
not
objectively
unreasonable
for
the
state
to
instruct
jurors
as
they
did?
if
that's
all
you
had,
then
that
would
be
the
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
your
reading
of
question
three
is
definitive.
i
think
it's
like
the
instruction,
the
jury
could
read
it
one
of
two
ways.
if
you
look
at
question
three,
the
issue
could
be
whether
others
could
have
had
an
intent,
in
other
words,
others
in
the
group,
not
simply
--
it
doesn't
show
that
the
accomplice
doesn't
have
to
have
the
requisite
intent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
the
question.
there
are
a
number
of
areas,
and
i
think
the
first
two
questions
point
in
the
opposite
direction.
they
do
not
say
we
don't
know
whether
it's
"the
crime"
or
"a
crime".
their
questions,
neither
one,
two
or
three
focus
on
that.
it's
a
more
general
question
that
we
could
read
the
opposite
way.
perhaps
you
can
read
it
the
way
you
are,
even
though
it
doesn't
say
is
it
"the
crime"
or
"a
crime".
but
there
again,
i
think
it's
incorrect
to
say
it's
quite
clear
that
the
question
--
and
certainly
not
questions
one
and
two,
i
mean
question
three
is
your
strongest
one
--
but
it's
still
not
clear
that
they
are
focusing
on
the
"the/a"
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
aedpa
of
course
requires
that
this
be
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law.
what
is
the
clearly
established
federal
law
that
was
unreasonably
applied?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that's
articulated
at
a
fairly
general
level.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
yarborough,
we've
said
that
the
more
general
the
rule,
the
more
leeway
courts
have
in
reaching
outcomes
in
a
case-by-case
determination.
so
you
have
a
very
general
rule,
and
to
find
an
unreasonable
application,
the
court
has
broad
leeway
because
it
is
a
general
rule.
and
you've
already
said
that
the
instruction
does
not
establish
unreasonable
application.
given
that,
isn't
it
pertinent,
although
people
have
objected
--
you've
objected
to
the
idea
that,
well,
all
they
did
was
send
them
back
with
the
instruction.
so
they
sent
them
back
with
something
that
you
said
could
be
reasonably
interpreted
correctly.
so
why
isn't
that
--
why
doesn't
that
--
given
the
leeway
the
state
court
has
because
this
is
a
general
rule,
why
isn't
that
sufficient
to
refute
the
idea
of
unreasonable
objective?
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you've
already
said
that
the
instruction
doesn't
get
you
there.
and
i
just
heard
you
say
that,
with
respect
to
the
questions,
we
can
dispute
what
the
jury
was
asking.
so
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
where
you
get
the
objectively
unreasonableness
if
you
can
read
the
instruction
correctly,
if
it's
--
if
you
can't
tell
what
the
jury
was
asking,
you
don't
know
that
they
were
reflecting
the
confusion
you
have
here.
so
is
all
you're
left
with
the
prosecutor's
statements?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
collins,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-772,
waddington
versus
sarausad.
