first,
is
there
some
constitutional
minimum?
let's
assume
direct
review.
is
there
some
constitutional
minimum
requirement
for
scienter
with
reference
to
an
accomplice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
the
same
--
is
that
the
same
as
purpose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
don't
take
the
position,
do
you,
or
do
you,
that
washington
law
conforms
to
the
model
penal
code?
i
thought
the
model
penal
code
was
much
more
defendant-friendly
than
you're
stating.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
--
would
--
would
you
say
that
the
trial
court
in
washington
states
law
correctly
if
it
says
that
being
accomplice
you
have
to
have
a
purpose
to
facilitate
the
commission
of
the
crime?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
agree
there
is
a
difference
in
"knowing"
and
"purpose"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
toward
the
bottom
of
page
123.
and
i
have
the
same,
i
have
the
same,
just
tieing
onto
justice
souter's
question,
on
the
same
subject.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
hypothetical
is
not
necessarily
correct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
gloss
that
the
washington
supreme
court
ended
up
with
was
exactly
the
same
as
the
instruction
that
was,
that
the
judge
gave
in
this
case
--
to
be
as
a
--
the
trial
judge,
whatever
the
state
of
the
law
was,
got
it
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
an
objection?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
objection
was
based
on
the
defense
proffer
of
an
instruction
which
was,
namely,
close
to
the
model
penal
code
that
says
you
have
to
have
the
same
--
is
anterior
principle,
and
that's
not
necessarily
the
law
in
every
state.
so
the
defense
bears
some
responsibility
for
not
--
for
--
number
one,
it
didn't
have
a
coherent
theory
either.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
objection
from
defense
counsel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
incorporated
the
--
the
principle
that
the
defense
counsel
had
been
arguing
for
from
the
outset
of
this
case,
that
you
must
have
the
same
scienter
as
the
principal,
and
that's
not
necessarily
the
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
can
go
on
in
some
states
but
not
--
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
law
as
i
understand
it.
