justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
washington
court
of
appeals,
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
what
they
are
doing
is
providing
a
literal
interpretation
of
the
jury
instruction,
as
i
think
we
have
to
presume
the
jury
did
when
they
got
that
instruction.
washington
court
of
appeals
is
interpreting
washington
law.
and
they
may
be
influenced
by
washington
case
law,
which
is
what
they
cite.
they
don't
--
they
quote
the
instruction
but
they
don't
say
"the
crime"
means
"a
crime".
that's
how
we
interpret
the
language
of
the
instruction.
so
there
is
an
overlay
of
washington
case
law,
principles
of
accomplice
liability
that
inform
this
instruction.
so
i
don't
know
that
you
can
--
it's
reasonable
to
argue
that
because
they
misinterpreted
washington
law,
they
were
misinterpreting
the
literal
language
of
the
jury
instruction.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
this
question
about
the
jury's
question
where
they
say
we
are
having
difficulty
agreeing
on
a
legal
definition
and
concept
of
accomplice;
when
a
person
willingly
participates
in
a
group
activity,
is
that
person
an
accomplice
to
any
crime
committed
by
anyone
in
the
group?
suppose
that
the
judge
had
answered
that
question
by
saying
a
person
who
participates
in
group
activity
is
guilty
of
the
crime
of
second
degree
murder
if
the
person
acts
with
knowledge
that
his
or
her
conduct
will
promote
or
facilitate
the
commission
of
the
crime
of
second
degree
murder.
would
you
have
a
case
if
that
answer
was
given?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
almost
a
direct
quote
from
the
instruction
that
was
given.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
put
in
crime
of
second
degree
murder
rather
than
the
crime.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
poses
a
difference
enough
to
make
a,
a
constitutional
violation
and
b,
make
it
unreasonable
for
the
washington
court
of
appeals
to
say
that
there
was
no
constitutional
violation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
with
the
jury
--
was
the
jury
told
that
the
arguments
of
counsel
are
not
the
law,
that
i,
the
judge,
will
tell
you
what
the
law
is?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
only
difference
between
that
case,
which
i
know
very
well,
and
this
case
is
that
in
that
case
there
was
no
issue
about
jury
instructions.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what's
the
relevance
of
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
has
to
do
with
the
retroactivity
whether
a
state
can
--
whether
pennsylvania
had
changed
the
interpretation
of
its
statute,
or
whether
what
they
said
it
meant
was
what
it
always
had
meant.
