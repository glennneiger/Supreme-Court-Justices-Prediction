mr.
theodore
s.
allison
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
with
petitioner's
counsel's
last
remark,
and
that
is
that
we
don't
know
what
the
consequences
would
be,
except
that
we
do
know
that
by
applying
the
review
bar
to
supplemental
jurisdiction
remands,
it
would
bring
us
closer
to
achieving
the
purpose
that
has
been
expressed
in
the
statutes
of
congress
since
1887.
i
know
that
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
late
chief
justice
rehnquist's
dissenting
opinion
when
he
was
an
associate
justice
in
the
thermtron
case,
and
justice
rehnquist
at
that
time
wrote
that
there
had
been
no
cases
since
the
review
bar
was
put
into
place
in
1887
--
no
cases
where
exceptions
to
review
had
been
recognized.
he
believed
that
it
was
a
plenary
bar
on
review.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
justice
ginsburg,
it
--
it
was
a
dissenting
opinion,
and
it
was
in
1976,
and
we
certainly
would
not
cite
it
as
authoritative
except
for
our
confidence
in
justice
rehnquist's
review
of
the
law
as
it
existed
at
that
time.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
that
is
--
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and,
in
fact,
to
harken
to
your
earlier
question,
to
your
honor's
earlier
question,
we
are
not
asking
for
thermtron
to
be
overruled,
but
i
think,
in
effect,
to
be
updated.
the
court
in
thermtron
did
give
a
rationale,
and
the
rationale
that
it
gave
was
that
it
viewed
--
the
opinion
for
the
court
by
justice
white
--
viewed
1447(c)
as
being
the
sole
source
of
federal
remand
power.
and
as
the
court
noticed
in
the
ensuing
30,
40
--
excuse
me
--
yes,
40-odd
years,
there
have
been
a
number
of
other
sources
of
remand
power
recognized.
and
we
see
no
reason
why
the
holding
in
thermtron
should
not
be
overruled
but
be
updated
to
recognize
that
--
that
the
spirit
of
what
the
court
held
in
that
case
would
be
served
and
would
be
harmonized
with
the
review
bar
as
it
has
existed
lo
these
120
odd-years,
would
be
served
by
expanding
the
--
excuse
me,
contracting
the
reach
of
thermtron
so
that
it
is
not
simply
1447(c)
remands,
but
any
remand
authorized
by
statute.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
it's
--
it's
an
essential
question,
justice
souter.
and
i
think
the
way
we
harmonize
it
is
to
say
that
thermtron
has
indeed
been
pared
back
by
the
court's
subsequent
decisions.
and,
of
course,
it
is
our
second
argument
that
the
court
do
something
with
the
rule
in
thermtron.
our
primary
argument
gets
to
the
question
of
the
statutory
language
and
whether
a
cohill
remand
falls
within
it.
but
our
secondary
argument
is
to
say,
certainly,
it's
well
recognized
that
cohill
disapproved
and
pared
down
that
portion
of
thermtron
that
held
that
the
only
remand
power
is
the
remand
power
expressed
in
1447(c).
in
a
--
in
a
later
case,
in
quackenbush,
the
question
of
whether
mandamus
or
appeal
was
the
appropriate
vehicle
for
challenging
remand
orders.
and
in
that
case,
again,
the
court
said
that
we
are
--
we
are
disavowing
thermtron's
sweeping
statement
that
mandamus
is
the
only
vehicle
for
challenging
a
remand
order.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
indeed,
the
court
did
not.
and
we
suggest
again
only
--
it
is
only
a
suggestion
in
our
brief
that
the
court
might
wish
to
look
at
the
ensuing
history
since
thermtron
and
make
a
similar
limiting
statement
that
recognizes
that
a
lot
of
remand
authority
has
been
established
since
thermtron
in
a
number
of
statutes
and
by,
of
course
--
by
the
court's
holding
in
cohill.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
well,
indeed
in
things
remembered,
the
court
was
considering
whether
a
1447
--
whether
1447's
review
bar
applied
to
a
remand
under
1452.
1452
is
another
statute
that
deals
with
remands
in
the
context
of
cases
associated
with
bankruptcy
issues.
and
in
that
case,
there
was
a
remand
for
failing
to
follow
a
removal
procedure,
and
the
court
held,
citing
--
citing
rice,
united
states
versus
rice,
based
on
congress's
awareness
of
the
universality
of
the
review
ban,
that
when
another
statute
comes
into
place
that
provides
for
remand,
the
review
bar
applies
whether
or
not
--
of
course--
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
--it's
a
little
bit
--
justice
ginsburg,
a
little
bit
different
than
the
court's
decision
in
osborn,
in
which
the
much
more
specific
westfall
act
provision
was
held
to
prevail
over
1447.
in
things
remembered,
it
was
simply
the
fact
that
the
review
bar
was
held
to
apply
to
a
remand,
even
according
--
under
another
statute,
and,
of
course,
recognizing
that
there
are
now
other
statutory
bases
for
remand.
the
interesting
thing
about
1452
--
and
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that
you
wrote
the
concurrence
on
this
--
is
that
1452
provides
for
remand
on
any
equitable
ground
and
that
such
remands
are
not
subject
to
review
by
appeal
or
otherwise.
so
1452,
again,
expresses,
i
think,
a
trend
in
the
thinking
of
congress,
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
thinking
of
congress,
that
--
that
the
review
bar
will
be
expanded
and
will
even
include
such
discretionary
decisions
by
a
district
court
as
any
equitable
ground.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
yes.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
that
is--
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
--that
is
true,
and
that
is
what
the
federal
circuit
said
--
meant
when
it
said
that
powerex
made
the
question
precedential.
because,
certainly,
if
things
remembered
had
decided
the
issue
that's
before
the
court
today,
i
think
the
issue
wouldn't
be
before
the
court
today.
and
that,
of
course,
is
why
we're
here.
but
the
thermtron
--
the
thermtron
issue
really
is
our
second
argument,
and
it
--
it
is
a
very
gentle
argument
that
the
court
--
and
if
the
court
certainly
wishes
to
continue
discussing
that,
that
is
--
that
is
very
profitable
for
what
we're
doing
here
today.
but
the
first
argument
is
that,
harkening
back
to
your
original
questions,
justice
ginsburg,
why
shouldn't
a
remand
when
only
state
law
claims
remain
in
a
case,
as
in
cohill
and
as
in
1367(c)(
3)
--
why
should
that
not
come
within
the
language
of
1447(c),
what
i'll
call
the
jurisdictional
clause,
because
it
clearly
is
a
matter
that
is
only
of
concern
to
state
courts?
and
i
think
that
the
court
in
united
mine
workers
v.
gibbs
made
clear
that
when
all
state
--
all
the
federal
claims
have
left
the
case
and
only
state
law
claims
remain,
that
it's
almost
presumptive
that
those
should
be
sent
back--
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
--that's
true,
justice
stevens.
that
is
his
argument,
and
i
think
what's
important
about
that
argument
is
the
inconsistency
it
sets
up.
it
essentially
casts
a
net
that
draws
in
these
supplemental
jurisdiction
cases.
and
what
the
net
does
is
it
allows
the
courts
of
appeals
to
review
some
artful
pleading
issues,
which
is
essentially
what
we
have
here.
we
have
state
law
claims,
and
our
opponents
are
suggesting
that
these
are,
in
fact,
disguised
federal
claims
that
must
be
heard
in
federal
court.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
yes.
the
rico
claim
was
what
--
was
what
gave
the
district
court
jurisdiction
over
the
case
in
the
first
place.
and
it's
interesting
that
in
the
--
in
the
district
court's
decision,
it
made
me
think
--
it
made
me
think
a
little
bit
of
the
waco
case,
because
in
the
district
court's
decision,
the
district
court
very
clearly
said,
first,
i
have
no
jurisdiction
over
these
state
law
claims,
and
i'm
going
to
remand
them,
and
now
i
will
turn
to
the
rico
claim
which
creates
a
conundrum
that
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
--yes.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
justice
ginsburg,
that's
why
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
press
that
point
because
i
think
--
i
think
that
even
we
can
see
that
the
court
exercised
its
jurisdiction
to
decide
and
dismiss
the
rico
claim,
although
it's
reminiscent
of
--
of
--
of
the
decision
in
kircher--
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
--right.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
have
made
every
effort
not
to
conflate
those
two
--
those
two
concepts,
and
in
fact
we
did
say
that
when
--
when
a
court
acquires
supplemental
jurisdiction
in
a
case,
that
that
is
a
species
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
at
that
point
--
as
the
court
held
in
city
of
chicago
v.
international
college
of
surgeons.
at
that
point
the
court
does
have
a
mandatory
discretion
to
--
or
mandatory
jurisdiction
to
exercise
power
over
the
entire
article
iii
case.
but
we
then
argue
when
the
federal
claims
leave,
the
case
that
jurisdiction
changes.
that
jurisdiction
changes
from
a
mandatory
one
that
the
court,
as
in
thermtron,
would
certainly
be
concerned
if
a
district
court
abjured
its
jurisdiction
that's
mandatory.
but
it
changes
by
operation
of
1367
from
mandatory
to
discretionary.
and
when
congress
passed
1367
in
1990,
congress
intended
to
codify
the
existing
law
right
up
through
cohill
on
the
subject
of
supplemental
jurisdiction,
combining
ancillary
and
pendent
in
the--
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
there
was
--
there
was
indeed
jurisdiction.
and
what
we
argue
is
that
the
nature
of
the
change,
when
it
goes
from
mandatory,
the
concern
of
thermtron,
to
discretionary,
which
gives
--
virtually
pushes
out
of
the
federal
court
to
the
state
courts
anytime
up
until
trial
--
the
nature
of
that
jurisdiction
changes,
and
we
believe
that
that
is
not
what
congress
intended
by
the
words
1447(c).
so
if
we
come
back
to
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
words
of
the
statute
should
be
construed
broadly
in
order
to
serve
the
purposes
of
--
of
remand.
the
court
has
made
clear
that
concerns
of
comity
and
federalism
say
that
we
should
construe
1447
in
favor
of
remand,
and
i
believe
that
that
should
extend
to
the
concept
of
the
whole
delay
and
shuttling.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
it
is
--
it
is
a
difficult
--
a
difficult
conundrum.
i
think
maybe
all
conundra
are
difficult,
but
this
one
particularly.
and,
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
opinion
that
you
wrote
for
the
court
in
the
arbaugh
case,
you
very
clearly
pointed
out
that
the
word
"jurisdiction"
is
used
in
a
variety
of
ways
by
legal
scholars,
by--
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
--that
--
that
is
correct,
but
that's
the
same
--
that
is
the
nature
--
that's
the
nature
of
the
problems
that
the
court
confronted
in
kircher
and
powerex.
again,
this
is
by
analogy
only.
we
are
not
concerned
about
--
about
labels
like
that,
if
the
district
court
believed
that
it
was
remanding
the
case
because
it
lacked
jurisdiction.
but
i'm
coming
back
now
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
i
have
found
no
case
in
this
court
that
has
given
a
definition
--
city
of
chicago
with
its
mandatory
language
was
the
closest
i
was
able
to
find.
the
koffski
case,
out
of
the
seventh
circuit,
is
the
one
case
i
was
able
to
find
from
a
higher
court
that
said
that
supplemental
jurisdiction
is
technically
a
form
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
what
we
argue--
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
--in
its
--
certainly,
in
its,
i
think
--
in
its
--
in
its
textbook
sense,
that
is
what
subject
matter
--
when
the
world
is
divided
between
subject
matter
and
personal
and
then
the
third,
territorial,
which
i
think
is
a
relation
--
has
a
relation
to
personal
--
when
the
world
is
divided
along
those
lines,
then
subject
matter
takes
on
the
broadest
possible
meaning,
but
we
have
conflicting
broad
policies.
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
a
broad
definition
of
subject
matter
definition;
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
a
statute
that
should
be
construed
to
favor
remand
at
almost
all
lawful
costs.
and
--
and
subject
matter,
if
we
step
back
from
our
--
our
dichotomy,
personal
and
subject
matter,
subject
matter
also
means,
as
--
as
your
honor
said
at
the
beginning
of
this
argument,
something
that
is
--
that
is
a
subject
with
which
the
federal
courts
should
be
concerned,
and
on
which
they
should
expend
their
resources.
and
we
now
have
the
circuit
courts
hearing
appeals
from
decisions
--
discretionary
decisions
because
they
are
technically
within
the
realm
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
but
clearly,
state
law
claims
are
not
the
subject
matter
with
which
the
federal
courts
should
routinely
be
concerned,
and
that's
why
united
mine
workers
--
and
cohill
echoed
it
--
said,
these
claims
should
be
sent
back,
and
cohill
even
--
both
cases
even
said
that
the
propriety
of
remanding
the
claims
should
be
reviewed
at
every
stage
in
the
litigation.
that
--
that
i
think
presents
us
a
pretty
strong
policy
by
this
court
that
remand
is
to
be
indulged
at
almost
any
lawful
cost.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
yes.
the
--
the
argument
--
and
i
was
attempting
to
make
a
technical
argument
in
the
brief,
and
i
think
today
i'm
speaking
in
slightly
more
global
terms
--
but
the
technical
argument
is
that
when
a
district
court
makes
a
decision,
in
the
words
of
gibbs,
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
those
claims,
then
the
claims
are
to
be
remanded--
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
--well,
justice
alito,
the
question
of
whether
it
changes
its
mind
i
think
is
intricately
bound
up
in
this
question
of
reviewability
because
the
cases
that
we
found
that
--
that
talked
about
reconsideration
talked
about
reconsideration
only
because
there
was
the
potential
for
review
of
these
orders.
i
think
the
norm
for
a
remanded
case
is
that
the
order
of
remand
is
entered,
and
the
order
of
remand
is
certified
and
mailed
to
the
state
court,
and
the
district
court
no
longer
has
jurisdiction
at
that
point.
now,
certainly
it
could
reconsider
as
it's
engaged
in
its
decision
process.
it
could
go
back
and
forth,
and
reconsider
before
it
signs
the
order.
but
that's
no
different
than
--
than
many
other
cases
in
which
the
court
can
make
a
discretionary
decision
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction.
the
only--
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
--and
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
--
again,
the
purpose
of
the
review
bar
as
it's
been
expressed
for
over
a
hundred
years
has
been
to
trust
district
judges
to
make
these
decisions
and
then
get
the
case
where
it
needs
to
be
to
be
resolved
on
its
merits.
so
to
say
that
the
court
chooses
not
to
hear
the
case,
it
--
it
suggests
something
a
little
bit
less
gray
than
the
decision
that
i
believe
the
court
would
make
when
it
decides
that
it's
inappropriate
to
hear
the
case,
in
the
words
of
gibbs.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
i
--
i
meant
only
to
suggest
that
it
is
not
a
--
it
is
not
a
choice.
it's
a
--
it
is
not
an
ill-considered
choice.
certainly,
there's
a
choice
involved
in
the
decision
that
it
would
be
inappropriate.
but
i
don't
see
--
and
i
--
i
wanted
to
resist
a
rhetorical
question,
but
then
i
don't
see
how
anyone
could
say
when
a
court
is
faced
with
--
with
only
state-law
claims
that
it
could
either
decide
or
not,
and
it
decides
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
retain
jurisdiction
over
those
claims,
that
somehow
it
should
retain
jurisdiction
over
those
claims.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
i
believe
--
well
--
and
--
and
this
is
a
mechanical
argument,
but
i
believe
that
when
the
court
makes
the
decision
and
then
--
and
then
executes
the
remand,
that
that
is
divesting
itself
of
jurisdiction.
and
perhaps
it
was
--
perhaps
it
was
a
poor
--
a
poor
word
choice.
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
it
is
simply
a
question,
i
think,
of
--
of
the
choice
of
the
word
"divest"
and
what
that
means.
i
would
--
i
would
analogize
in
order
to
perhaps
make
it
seem
more
--
more
accurate
--
i
would
analogize
to
what
a
district
court
now
can
do
under
section
1447(e),
where
it
makes
a
decision
applying
the
law,
using
its
discretion,
to
allow
joinder
of
a
nondiverse
party
that
would
then
destroy
diversity
and
require
the
case
to
be
remanded.
and
i
would
say
in
that
case
that
the
court
makes
a
decision
that
divests
it
of
jurisdiction,
and
it
is
very
technical
to
say
that
--
that,
yes,
it
lacks
jurisdiction
as
soon
as
it
enters
the
order
admitting
that
party
to
the
case.
but
that
may
very
well
be
the
same
order
that
remands
the
case
to
the
state
court.
but
i
--
i
do
--
i
do
see
that
there
is
power.
and
if
the
case
is
going
to
turn
on
power,
as
the
court
--
some
of
the
language
in
powerex
suggested
that
it
might,
then
i
don't
know
that
we
--
i
don't
know
that
we
make
much
headway.
but
i
--
i
--
i
see
1447(c),
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
as
being
broad
enough
to
comfortably
take
in
the
situation
where
the
state-law
claims,
not
really
within
the
subject
matter
of
the
district
court's
power,
are
determined
inappropriate
for
that
court
to
hear
and
sent
back.
and
it
would
bring
us
that
much
closer
to
realizing
the
purpose
of
the
review
bar
that
has
existed
since
1887,
taking
a
category
of
cases
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
circuit
courts.
i
--
i
had
wanted
to
offer
the
court
some
statistics,
as
maybe
law
professors
might,
about
the
number
of
cases
that
are
heard
on
this
type
of
appeal.
i
can
say
that
the
cases
that
we
found
in
our
footnotes
18
through
20
represent
something
close
to
the
universe
of
cases
in
which
discretion
was
found
to
be
abused.
and
that
abuse
of
discretion
is
nowhere
near
as
egregious
as
the
legal
errors
that
a
district
court
might
commit
in
making
erroneous
judgments
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction
which
were
nonetheless
subjected
to
the
review
bar
in
kircher
and
powerex.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
theodore
s.
allison
--i
will
stop
now.
thank
you.
