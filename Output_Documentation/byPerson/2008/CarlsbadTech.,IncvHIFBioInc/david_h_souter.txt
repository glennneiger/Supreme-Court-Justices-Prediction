okay.
but
no
matter
--
no
matter
what
adjective
or
what
verb
you
use,
that's
overruling
a
very
clear
rule
of
thermtron.
and
we
normally
operate
on
a
theory
that
when
a
conventional
statute
is
construed
by
this
court,
it
stays
construed
until
congress
changes
it.
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
follow
the
line
of
reasoning
that
you're
proposing,
even
though
you
talk
about
updating
and
harmonizing,
without
violating
that
basic
stare
decisis
rule.

we
did
--
we
did
not
disavow
the
relationship
between
(c)
and
(d).
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
--
you
think
that
choosing
not
to
hear
is
distinguishable
from
a
decision
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
hear?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
even
--
even
on
your
analysis
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
the
cart
is
before
the
horse,
because
it
is
--
it
is
not
remanding
because
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
what
you
are
saying
is
that
after
it
remands,
it
loses
jurisdiction,
and
those
are
two
very
distinct
categories.
the
--
the
premise
for
the
declaration
that
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction
is
a
premise
that
even
on
your
argument
does
not
arise
until
following
remand.
so
there's
no
way
you
can
fit
it,
it
seems
to
me,
into
the
category
of
--
of
remanding
because
at
the
point
of
deciding
to
remand
it
has
no
jurisdiction.
that,
in
fact,
is
false.
