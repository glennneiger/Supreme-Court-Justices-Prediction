mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
single
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
bar
to
review
under
1447(d)
is
applicable
to
a
district
court's
discretionary
decision
to
decline
the
exercise
of
supplemental
jurisdiction.
in
this
case,
after
the
district
court
dismissed
respondents'
federal
rico
claim,
the
district
court
remanded
the
remaining
state
law
claims
under
1367(c).
that
was
not
a
remand
based
upon
a
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
jurisdiction
was
specifically
conferred
upon
the
court
by
1367(a).
it's
been
the
rule
for
some
30
years
that
the
bar
of
1447(d)
is
limited
to
the
specific
grounds
set
forth
in
1447(c).
and
for
reference
the
statutes
are
on
page
2
and
3
of
petitioner's
blue
brief.
those
two
grounds
are
a
remand
that's
based
upon
a
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
a
remand
that
is
based
upon
any
defect
other
than
a
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
if
it's
raised
by
a
timely
motion
for
remand
filed
within
30
days
of
the
notice
of
removal.
the
only
prong
of
1447(c)
that's
applicable
in
this
case
is
whether
this
remand
is
one
that's
based
upon
a
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
now,
congress
clearly
conferred
jurisdiction
on
the
district
courts
in
1367(a),
where
the
case
contains
a
federal
claim
and
related
state
law
claims,
and
a
remand
based
upon
a
court's
discretion
to
decline
to
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction
is
not
a
remand
that's
based
upon
the
court's
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
jurisdiction
either
exists
or
it
does
not.
a
district
court's
power
to
hear
a
case
and
its
power
to
decline
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
thing.
absent
the
power
to
hear
a
case,
a
district
court
cannot
decline
to
exercise
that
--
or
cannot
exercise
discretion
to
decline
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction.
now,
in
the
--
this
court's
osborn
v.
haley
case,
it
made
reference
back
to
carnegie-mellon
and
also
united
mine
workers
v.
gibbs,
that
even
if
only
state
law
claims
are
remaining
in
the
case
after
the
federal
claim
has
been
resolved,
the
district
court
has
discretion
consistent
with
article
iii
to
retain
jurisdiction
over
that
cause
of
action.
now,
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
circuit's
analysis
in
this
case,
that
a
remand
based
upon
1367(c)
is
a
remand
based
upon
a
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
in
its
view
an
independent
basis
for
that
jurisdiction
is
lacking.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
justice
ginsburg,
i
agree
with
that,
because
if
the
court
does
say
that
i
am
remanding
this
because,
either
rightly
or
wrongly,
i
lack
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
then
that
would
fall
squarely
within
1447(c)
and
(d).
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
i
agree
with
you,
justice
ginsburg,
that
that
seems
rather
confusing.
i
would
address
my
answer
in
this
way:
the
review
ban
of
1447(d)
arose
in
the
situations
where
apparently
congress
wanted
to
--
to
inhibit
the
abuse
by
those
seeking
only
to
delay
the
case
by
filing
a
motion
for
remand.
for
example,
a
case
that
is
filed
in
state
court
that
clearly
expresses
no
federal
question
or
diversity
issue,
yet
the
defendant,
in
order
to
delay
the
case,
will
then
remove
it
to
federal
court.
in
those
situations,
congress
wants
to
prevent
those
kinds
of
frivolous
removals
to
federal
court.
but
here,
in
our
particular
case
--
and
maybe
--
let
me
back
up
a
minute.
maybe
we
should
look
at
that
in
a
different
way,
because
even
though
you
may
have
a
legitimate
basis
for
removing
the
case
to
federal
court
and
the
district
court
disagrees
with
you,
perhaps
the
better
policy
is
that
those
types
of
remands
should
not
be
reviewable,
even
though
sometimes
a
district
court
is
going
to
get
them
wrong.
but
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
a
federal
rico
claim
asserted
against
us
in
state
court,
and
as
a
defendant
we
were
not
removing
that
case
on
some
frivolous
basis.
we
were
removing
it
because
we
were
entitled
to
be
in
federal
court.
it
was
only
after
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
federal
rico
count
--
and
there
was
no
motion
for
remand
on
this
case
filed
by
respondents
--
the
district
court
sua
sponte
decided
that
he
was
not
going
to
exercise
his
power
to
hear
this
case
because
he
thought
there
were
legitimate
state
law
claims
and
he
remanded
on
that
basis.
now,
that's
a
discretionary
remand,
and
normally
we
would
be
arguing
that
where
discretion
is
exercised
by
a
district
court,
it
should
be
reviewable
for
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
i'm
not
sure
about
the
number
of
--
percentage
of
cases
that
--
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
decision
by
the
appellate
court
to
say
we
shouldn't
interfere
in
that,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
i
can
give
you
an
answer
to
that
because
there
is
a
recent
case
that's
in
our
brief,
the
brookshire
case
from
the
fifth
circuit,
where
the
district
court
exercised
jurisdiction
over
federal
and
supplemental
claims,
and
did
that
for
quite
a
while
and
ruled
on
a
number
of
dispositive
motions;
and
then
basically
on
the
eve
of
trial,
after
resolving
the
federal
claim,
remanded
it
back
to
state
court.
the
fifth
circuit,
because
it
had
the
ability
to
review
that,
under
the
statutory
construction,
was
able
to
review
that
on
the
basis
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
and
said
that
the
district
court
had
definitely
abused
its
discretion.
after
retaining
jurisdiction
for
that
length
of
time
and
then
returning
it
to
state
court,
that
was
a
waste
of
judicial
resources.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
that
is
true.
this
case
is
different
because
what
the
--
what
the
district
court
had
labeled
as
legitimate
state
law
claims
as
to,
for
example,
inventorship,
we
argued
are
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court,
and
that
is
why
we
appealed
to
the
federal
circuit
in
order
to
have
that
issue
resolved.
here,
if
we
went
back
to
state
court,
we
would
be
in
the
position
of
having
to
argue
to
the
state
court
that
the
state
court
lacked
jurisdiction
to
hear
that
claim
because
it
was
something
that
was
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
it
seems
that
in
this
particular
situation
it
would
be
better
to
have
the
federal
circuit
to
pass
upon
the
exclusivity
of
the
inventorship
issue
under
the
patent
laws
rather
than
have
to
go
back
to
state
court
and
work
back
up
through
the
state
court
system
to
have
that
resolved.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
it
became
a
federal
question
because
in
our
view
it
arose
under
the
patent
laws
because
when
they
filed
their
complaint,
even
though
they
couched
it
in
terms
of
purely
state
law
claims,
they
did
allege
that
we
had
falsely
claimed
to
be
the
inventors;
and
the
basis
for
that
claim
that
we
falsely
claimed
to
be
the
inventors
was
the
oath
and
declaration
that
was
filed
in
connection
with
our
patent
applications
at
the
u.s.
patent
and
trademark
office.
so
what
they
were
raising
was
an
issue
with
respect
to
our
ability
to
claim
to
be
the
inventors
of
what
we
claimed
in
our
u.s.
patent
applications.
therefore,
since
that
falls
squarely
under
our
entitlement
to
--
to
inventorship,
of
what
we
claim
to
be
the
inventors,
under
article
i,
section
8,
it
seemed
to
us
that
that
clearly
fell
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
yes.
if
we
just
read
1447(d)
on
its
face,
that's--
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
--seems
to
be
what
it
says.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
that
would
be
going
against
the
rule
that
was
set
out
in
thermtron,
that
1447(d)
was
limited
to
only
the
specified
grounds
of
1447(c),
which
are
lack
of--
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
--i'm
not
sure
that
would
be
a
simple
solution
to
this
case,
justice
stevens,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
if
we
--
if
the
court
decides
to
do
that,
then
we
return
to
those
areas
where
total
chaos
could
really
break
out,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
we
would
be
in
a
situation
where
district
courts
can
--
can
dress
up
in
language
that
is
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
remand
cases,
knowing
that
there
is
not
going
to
be
any
review.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
if
we
were
to
read
1447(d),
just
plainly
on
its
face
without--
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
--that
is
the
exact
holding
of
thermtron,
that
they
were
not
going
to
construe
that
so
woodenly
to
allow
a
district
court
to
abdicate
its
mandatory
jurisdiction.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
mr.
chief
justice,
it
could,
but--
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
--again,
i'm
not
sure
how
we
would
divide
those
up
between
big
things
and
picayune
things.
but
i
think,
to
answer
your
question,
we
have
30
years
of
this
particular
rule
under
thermtron
being
uniformly
applied
by
all
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal,
and
they
have
found
this
to
be
a
workable
statutory
interpretation
to
give
them
a
framework
to
handle
these
kinds
of
cases.
and
it's
not
a
situation
where
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
have
run
away
from
situations
like
this,
where
remands
have
been
based
upon
declining
to
exercise
discretionary
power
to
send
it
back
to
state
court.
they
have
seemed
to
want
to
work
within
the
statutory
framework
to
review
those
kinds
of
cases.
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
large
departure
to
go
back
and
try
to
modify
what
all
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal,
except
for
maybe
the
federal
circuit,
has
adopted
as
a
workable
framework
in
order
to
solve
these
kinds
of
problems.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
and
yet--
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
--yes,
quackenbush
is
a--
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
--we
would
have
to
overthrow
that
as
well,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
quackenbush
was
a
remand
based
upon
abstention
--
abstention-based
remand
under
burford,
and
in
that
case,
this
court
found
that
abstention-based
remands
did
not
fall
within
either
prong
of
1447(c).
so
--
in
fact,
this
court
gave
that
very
little
attention
in
quackenbush
before
it
moved
on
to
the
1291
issue.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
yes,
we
did
say
that,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
they
--
they
expressly
said
you
should
overrule
thermtron,
but
the
strong
suggestion
in
their
brief
was
perhaps
you
should.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
given
the
fact
that
congress
has
twice
amended
1447(c)
after
thermtron,
it
seems
that
they
have
actually
ratified
this
court's
statutory
construction
under
thermtron,
and
have
agreed
to
it--
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
--no,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
thermtron
they
could
have
done
it
in
a
very
direct
way.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
i
can't
suggest
what
the
court
might
finally
decide
other
than
to
say
that
--
that,
again,
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
have
uniformly
applied
this.
they
seem
to
be--
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
--actually,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
was
going
to
be
my
next
point,
about
the
federal
circuit,
but
--
it
does,
again,
provide
a
workable
framework
for
dealing
with
these
issues,
and
it
seems
to
be
a
very
large
departure
to
go
back
and
wipe
out
the
last
30
years
of
case
law
that
has
been
developed
to
handle
these
issues.
it
would
be
a
large
departure.
if
there's
no
other
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
well,
mr.
chief
justice
--
sorry
--
justice
stevens,
that
would
be
an
exception
under
thermtron
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
called
for
because
the
way
it's
been
interpreted,
it
has
to
be
--
and
the
way
even
the
amendments
in
'88
and
again
in
'96
--
it's
only
barred
if
it's
for
a
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
plainly
here
a
discretionary
remand
is
not
for
that
basis.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
well,
i
think
the
other
--
the
other
problem
with
that
is
the
whole
doctrine
of
--
of
supplemental
jurisdiction
that
was
first
laid
out
in
carnegie-mellon
and
united
mine
workers,
where
the
difference
between
remands
under
1367(c)
seem
not
to
overlap
with
the
remands
under
1447(d)
and
1441.
so
if
we
made
that
an
exception
and
we
pulled
this
into
1447(d),
it
--
i'm
not
sure
what
the
consequences
would
be
from
doing
that.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
i
just
had
a
few
quick
points
that
i'd
like
to
bring
up.
first,
i
would
just
like
to
reiterate
that
when
congress
enacted
1367,
that
gave
it
article
iii
jurisdiction
in
those
matters,
just
as
1331
and
1332
do.
i
would
also
like
to
reiterate
that
--
that
stare
decisis
should
be
maintained
over
this
statutory
interpretation
because
it
has
proved
to
be
workable,
rather
than
not
workable.
again,
the
circuit
courts
--
even
though
as
mr.
chief
justice
has
iterated
that
they
have
to
follow
this,
they
have
found
it
to
be
a
workable
framework.
and,
again,
as
the
court
expressed
in
powerex,
they
agree
that
in
quackenbush
that
thermtron
was
not
altered.
and
congress
has
--
has
seemingly
ratified
this
court's
interpretation
in
thermtron,
and
as
it
has
been
applied
in
quackenbush.
mr.
glenn
w.
rhodes
my
response
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
until
a
court
decides
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
under
1367(c)
to
either
exercise
that
power
or
not
exercise
that
power.
and
unless
there's
any
further
questions
for
me,
i
ask
that
the
--
this
be
remanded
to
the
federal
circuit
to
decide
on
the
merits
of
the
appeal.
