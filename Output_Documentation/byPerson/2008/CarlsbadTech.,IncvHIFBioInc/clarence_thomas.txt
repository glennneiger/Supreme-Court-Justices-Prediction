justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
and
it's
not
nearly
as
entertaining.
after
respondent
files
a
lawsuit
in
a
california
state
court,
petitioner
removed
the
case
to
federal
court
and
sought
dismissal
of
the
lawsuit's
only
federal
claim.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
federal
claim
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
it
then
declined
to
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
the
remaining
state
law
claims
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
section
1367(c)(3)
which
provides
that
a
district
court
may
decline
to
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
claim
if
it
has
dismissed
all
claims
over
which
it
has
original
jurisdiction
that
would
be
federal
claims.
the
district
court
remanded
the
case
to
state
court.
petitioner
appealed
arguing
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
declining
to
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
the
state
law
claims.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
appellate
review
of
the
district
court's
decision
was
barred
by
28
u.s.c.
1447
(c)
and
(d)
which
this
court
has
interpreted
to
preclude
appellate
review
of
remand
orders
that
are
based
on
a
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
appellate
review
bar
applied
in
this
case
because
the
district
court's
remand
order
could
be
colorably
characterized
as
a
remand
based
on
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
we
disagree.
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
conclude
that
a
district
court's
order
remanding
a
case
to
state
courts
after
declining
to
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction
is
not
a
remand
based
on
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
for
the
purposes
of
28
u.s.c.
1447
(c)
and
(d).
such
remand
orders
are
not
based
on
the
absence
of
jurisdiction
but
on
a
district
court's
discretionary
decision
not
to
hear
the
claims.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justices
stevens
and
scalia
have
also
filed
concurring
opinions.
and
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
