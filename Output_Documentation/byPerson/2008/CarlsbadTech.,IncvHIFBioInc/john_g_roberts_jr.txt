chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-1437,
carlsbad
technology
v.
hif
bio,
inc..
mr.
rhodes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there'd
be
no
need
to
dress
up
anything.
i
mean,
that's
justice
stevens's
point.
you
wouldn't
have
to
dress
up
anything;
if
you
send
it
back,
it's
not
reviewable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
"woodenly"
is
a
bit
much.
i
mean,
they're
going
to
read
it
not
to
say
what
it
says.
and
thermtron
involved
the
court
saying:
i'm
not
going
to
take
this
because
i'm
too
busy
with
other
things.
i
mean,
it
could
be
limited
to
that
unusual
situation,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it
would
solve
the
problem
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out
earlier,
that
this
way
you
don't
get
to
appeal
big
things
like
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
but
you
do
get
to
appeal
picayune
things.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
thought
the
respondents
asked
us
to
overrule
thermtron.
on
page
22,
you
say,
"respondents'
implicit
request
for
this
court
to
overrule
thermtron
should
be
rejected.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
gets
a
lot
of
attention
across
the
street?
the
reviewability
of
remand
orders
gets
----
[laughter]
i
mean,
in
one
of
those
provisions,
they
said
this
was
only
technical
amendments,
and
if
they're
just
doing
technical
amendments,
that
doesn't
mean
they
have
to
look
at
it
and
approve
the
whole
thing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
don't
have
a
choice,
right?
they
can't
say,
i
don't
like
the
supreme
court
rule
so
i'm
not
going
to
apply
it,
other
than
the
federal
circuit.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
allison.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
idea
is
there
is
jurisdiction,
but
when
the
federal
claims
fall
out,
then
there's
no
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay,
but
that
seems
to
me
to
echo
the
fundamental
misperception
that
if
you
have
federal
jurisdiction
based
on
a
particular
event
--
let's
say,
if
you're
dumping
chemicals
in
the
water,
that
gives
you
a
federal
cause
of
action;
you
have
federal
jurisdiction;
there's
a
trial.
it
turns
out
you
weren't
dumping
chemicals
--
you
don't
then
say,
there
was
no
jurisdiction;
there
was
jurisdiction
before,
but
once
the
finding
is
made
that
the
facts
didn't
support
it,
then
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
you
say,
there
was
jurisdiction
all
the
time,
and
you
lose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you.
mr.
rhodes,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose,
though,
if
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
retain
jurisdiction,
then
maybe
there
is
--
there
never
was
jurisdiction,
right?
you
said
they
have
discretion
to
exercise
or
not.
well,
if
it
turns
out
they
don't
have
discretion
to
exercise
--
you
know,
because
it's
a
huge
state
claim
and
a
tiny
federal
claim
--
why
wouldn't
that
properly
be
regarded
as
an
absence
of
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-1437,
carlsbad
technology,
inc.
versus
hif
bio,
inc.
