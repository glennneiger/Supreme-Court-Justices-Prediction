justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
there
something
odd
about
saying
if
it's
really
fundamental
like
the
presence
or
absence
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
that
is
not
reviewable?
it's
not
disputed,
right?
that
if
the
district
court
says,
i
lack
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over,
let's
say,
the
rico
claim,
as
wrong
as
that
might
be,
that
would
not
be
reviewable,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
though
that
could
be
a
very
grave
error
and
yet,
on
a
matter
of
discretion,
that
that
would
be
reviewable.
and
i
appreciate
your
statutory
argument,
but
it
just
seems
odd
to
think
that
congress
would
want
to
be
firm
that
if
the
--
if
the
remand
is
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
wrong
or
right,
no
review;
but
if
it's
a
discretionary
exercise
--
i
could
keep
this,
but
i
choose
not
to
--
that
that
is
reviewable.
that
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense
to
say
the
judge
who
could
keep
it
or
remand
it,
that
that
action
is
reviewable,
but
the
action
of
saying
i
don't
have
jurisdiction,
when
indeed
the
court
did
have
jurisdiction,
is
just
totally
immune
from
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
it
be
--
i
mean,
here
the
district
judge
said:
i
got
rid
of
the
rico
claim;
all
that's
left
are
state
law
claims,
and
there's
no
federal
interest
in
this
case
anymore.
they're
all
state
law
claims,
they
belong
in
state
court,
good-bye.
i
could
keep
it,
i
choose
not
to,
because
it
isn't
a
sound
use
of
the
resources
of
the
federal
court.
now,
even
if
you're
right
that
this
is
a
discretionary
decision,
so
you
can't
say
no
jurisdiction
because
the
discretion
implies
that
there
is
power,
isn't
it
99
cases
out
of
100
that
the
court
of
appeals,
assuming
reviewability,
will
say,
we
should
defer
to
the
district
judges
on
questions
of
this
nature,
the
district
judge's
decision
that
this
isn't
worth
the
time
of
the
federal
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
you
--
as
a
practical
judgment,
the
federal
claim
is
gone,
there
is
pendent
jurisdiction
--
or
it's
now
supplemental
jurisdiction
--
over
the
state
claim,
but
the
district
court
is
told
by
congress:
it's
your
call;
it's
a
matter
of
discretion.
and
the
judge
gives
one
of
the
reasons
that's
enumerated,
that
reason
being
that
the
state
claims
are
overwhelming
in
this
case,
the
rico
claim
is
dismissed,
thinking
it
was
worthless,
so
it's
a
state
case.
why
would
a
court
of
appeals
overturn
such
a
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
--
because
you'd
would
have
to
retread
the
same
ground
in
the
state
court
that
had
already
been
covered
in
the
federal
court,
but
that's
not
the
kind
of
case
that
was
presented
here.
i
know
the
case
has
lingered
for
a
long
time,
but
there
was
no
processing
of
those
state
law
claims.
the
judge
concentrated
on
rico,
threw
it
out,
and
said,
the
rest
of
the
claims
i'm
not
interested
in.
so
it's
not
a
case
like
the
fifth
circuit
where
there
was
a
large
investment
of
federal
court
energy
and
time,
and
sending
it
back
would
mean
going
over
once
again
what
had
already
transpired
in
the
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
explain
why
that
is
a
federal
question?
it's
a
dispute
over
the
ownership
of
this
invention,
right?
so
it's
not
a
question
of
the
validity
of
a
patent
or
infringement
of
a
patent?
it's
just
the
invention
is
like
any
res,
and
two
parties
are
disputing
about
ownership.
why
is
--
why
does
that
become
a
federal
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
could
we
do
that
in
light
of
thermtron?
thermtron
went
against
the
clear
text
of
the
statute
that
says
remands
are
not
reviewable,
period;
and
in
thermtron
the
court
said,
yes,
they
are
sometimes,
if
we
think
it's
so
outrageous
for
a
district
judge
to
say:
yes,
i've
got
jurisdiction
over
this
case,
but
my
docket
is
so
crowded,
and
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
small-change
case;
it
belongs
in
state
court.
the
court,
i
think,
was
outraged
by
a
district
court
thinking
that
it
could
dump
a
case
simply
because
it
was
too
busy
with
more
important
things.
that
was
--
that
was
the
setting
of
thermtron,
and
to
reach
the
result
that
the
court
reached,
the
court
had
to
go
against
the
language
of
the
statute
which
--
which
read
in
absolute
terms.
but
anyway,
the
court
did
that,
and
then
they
gave
a
rationale
for
what
the
new
test
was
going
to
be.
it
was
no
longer
going
to
be
remands
are
no
longer
--
remands
are
not
reviewable;
it's
going
to
be
--
that
applies
only
to
the
cases
where
--
what
was
it,
subsections
(c)
and
(d)
of
1447?
that
--
it
--
the
court
read
the
statute
to
say
less
than
it
in
fact
did.
that's
what
thermtron
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
only
--
one
clear
way
to
do
it
would
be
to
overrule
thermtron,
but
neither
party
has
asked
for
that.
you
haven't
asked
for
it,
and
the
other
side
hasn't
asked
for
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
concern
is
what
was
the
court's
reasoning,
and
you
could
apply
the
court's
reasoning,
its
interpretation
of
1447.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
a
dissenting
opinion,
and
that
was
how
many
years
ago?
how
many
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
have
a
majority
rationale
that
says,
although
1447(d)
reads
in
absolute
terms,
in
fact
the
only
remands
that
it
--
that
it
covers
are
those
based
on
a
defect
in
the
removal
or
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
so
you
can't
--
you
can't
say,
well,
thermtron
had
a
result
that
we
can
limit
to
thermtron's
own
unusual
facts,
because
the
court
gave
a
rationale.
i
mean,
courts
give
reasons
for
what
they
do.
and
the
court
drastically
limited
1447(d)
when
it
said
1447(d)
has
to
be
read
consonant
with
1447(c),
and
1447(c)
deals
with
only
two
kinds
of
remands,
one
for
defective
removal
and
the
other
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
in
addition
to
the
civil
rights
provision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
that's
a
specific
statute
that
would
prevail
over
the
general
provision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
things
remembered,
i
think,
was
raised
very
carefully,
just
to
say
that
the
question
that's
before
the
court
now
has
not
been
decided
before,
the
precise
question
here--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
discretionary
remand?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i
think
--
i
looked
again
at
things
remembered,
and
it
turned
out
to
be
just
as
i
remembered
it
----
[laughter]
--that
it
was
neutral,
colorless.
it
just
said
we
haven't
been
confronted
with
this
issue.
and
i
think
powerex
said
the
same
thing,
although
it
said
it
in
more
definite
terms
--
it
is
far
from
clear.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
the
--
maybe
the
district
judge
didn't
say
that.
maybe
you
can
point
me
to
the
place
where
it
did.
but
if
it
did
say
it,
it's
flatly
wrong,
because
there
is
--
that's
what
supplemental
jurisdiction
is.
it's
says
you
have
jurisdiction.
it's
a
huge
difference
between
you
have
no
jurisdiction,
you
are
powerless--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
you
have
power,
but
it's
up
to
you
to
exercise
it
or
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
--
it
wasn't
a
discretionary
decision
about
rico.
rico
--
there
was
no
federal
claim
stated.
that's
out
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
over
are
the
supplemental
claims,
which
it
can
choose
not
to
exercise,
but
it
can
say,
"i
don't
have
jurisdiction",
because
congress
has
given
supplemental
jurisdiction
but
then
left
it
to
the
court
to
remand
on
stated
conditions.
but
you
--
you
seem
to
conflate
the
absence
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
with
a
discretionary
decision
not
to
exercise
subject
matter
jurisdiction
that
the
court
undoubtedly
has.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
--
then
what
you
are
doing
is
that
you
are
using
the
label
"subject
matter
jurisdiction"
in
a
way
that
seems
to
me,
that
is,
there
are
many
categories
that
could
be
ambiguous
at
the
edges,
but
not
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
subject
matter
jurisdiction
means,
court,
you
have
no
power,
period.
there's
no
diversity,
there's
no
federal
question,
there's
no
other
basis
for
the
federal
court
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
and
to
say,
well,
we
can
extend
the
label
"subject
matter
jurisdiction"
to
include
a
case
where
the
district
court
chooses
not
to
hear
certain
claims,
even
though
it
has
jurisdiction
over
them,
i
think
is
a
--
is
a
--
a
misapplication
of
the
notion
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
not
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
jurisdiction
is
personal
jurisdiction,
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
what
i
did
in
arbaugh
was
to
explain
that
all
kinds
of
things,
like
time
limits
on
when
you
can
sue,
have
been
labeled
jurisdictional
and
mandatory
when
in
fact
they
are
not.
they
are
simply
statutes
of
limitation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it
only
technical?
it
says,
court,
you
can
exercise
power.
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
the
power
that
the
court
has
to
hear
a
given
controversy,
and
under
supplemental
jurisdiction,
there
is
undoubted
power
in
the
district
court
to
hear
those
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
--
you
put
it
in
terms
in
your
brief
--
if
i
understood
your
position
correctly
--
yes,
there
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
supplemental
claims,
but
once
the
district
court
chooses
not
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction,
it
--
and
these
were
the
words
you
used
--
"it
divests
itself
of
jurisdiction".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
discretionary--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
discretionary
decision
is
that
it
chooses
not
to
hear
the
case.
it's
not
--
there's
no
discretion
there.
there's
nothing
discretionary
about
saying
we
have
no
jurisdiction.
"we
have
no
jurisdiction"
means
we
have
no
power.
so
the
--
the
two
are
just
at
odds
with
each
other.
no
power,
yes
power,
but
we
choose
not
to
exercise
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
would
argue
for
a
highly
deferential
standard
of
review,
respecting
the
district
judge's
determination
that
it's
not
what
--
it
hasn't
invested
any
time
in
these
questions,
and
it
shouldn't
because
they
are
purely
state-law
questions.
that's
--
but
that's
something
quite
different
from
--
from
a
--
the
--
the
terminology
that
you
used
is
troublesome
because
a
court
doesn't
have
power
to
divest
itself
of
jurisdiction.
if
congress
gives
it
jurisdiction,
it
has
it,
and
the
court
can't
divest
itself
of
that.
it
can,
if
congress
permits
it,
decline
to
exercise
jurisdiction,
but
a
court
is
not
capable
of
divesting
itself
of
jurisdiction.
