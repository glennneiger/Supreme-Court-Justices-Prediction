justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
sort
of
a
preliminary
question?
if
we
just
applied
the
plain
language
of
1447(d),
then
this
case
was
properly
remanded,
and
it
was
--
the
remand
order
is
not
subject
to
review.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
really
prevents
us--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--from
reaching
that
decision
in
this
case?
because
actually
it's
an
open
question
because
you
are
both
arguing
about
it
here
and
you
certainly
disagree.
why
couldn't
we
just
simply
say,
for
this
particular
category
of
remand
orders,
we'll
just
apply
the
plain
language
of
1447(d)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
it
would
be
a
modification
of
the
dicta
in
thermtron,
but
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
simple
solution
to
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
that
wouldn't
--
that
wouldn't
avoid
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
pretextual
district
court
orders
wouldn't
avoid
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
just
have
to
distinguish
thermtron.
you
don't
have
to
overrule
it.
it
still
applies
on
its
facts.
that's
a
very
different
problem.
when
the
judge
says,
i'm
too
busy
to
hear
this,
i'm
going
to
send
it
back
to
state
court,
that's
what
thermtron
resolved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
is
not
--
that's
not
involved
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
make
one
comment
on
the
large
departure:
would
it
be
a
large
departure
if
we
just
said,
in
the
very
narrow
category
of
cases
where
there
has
been
a
remand
on
the
basis
of
--
the
district
judge
doesn't
want
to
exercise
supplementary
jurisdiction
over
state
law
claims,
that's
not
appealable,
period?
just
say
that's
a
slight
exception
from
thermtron?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
not
amendments
of
subsection
(d),
and
subsection
(d)
is
what
has
the
language
that
really
reads
right
on
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your
opponent's
argument
is
that
the
--
the
claims
that
remain
do
include
a
federal
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
ruling
on
the
rico
claim
itself?
that
was
clearly
a
federal
issue.
