mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
a
4-3
decision,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
affirmed
correction
law
section
24,
which
prohibits
petitioner
from
bringing
a
section
1983
claim
for
money
damages
in
any
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
instead,
that
statute
relegates
mr.
haywood
and
anyone
else
seeking
money
damages
under
section
1983
to
either
bring
their
case
in
federal
court
or
to
accept
what
the
new
york
legislature
has
deemed
a
state
law
alternative.
that
state
law
alternative
does
not
allow
mr.
haywood
to
sue
the
prison
guards
who
violated
his
civil
rights;
instead,
he
can
only
sue
the
state.
it
provides
for
no
punitive
damages.
it
provides
for
no
attorneys'
fees,
a
shortened
90-day
notice
of
claim
provision,
30
days
shorter
than
what
this
court
found
violative
in
felder.
it
provides
for
no
right
to
jury
trial.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
your
honor,
it
is
true
that
the
state
has
waived
sovereign
immunity
for
claims
brought
in
the
court
of
claims
under
that
state
law.
but,
your
honor,
they
haven't
waived
sovereign
immunity
for
punitive
damages
or
for
attorneys'
fees,
both
of
which
are
remedies
that
are
specifically
available
to
petitioners,
to
plaintiffs,
in
section
1983
actions.
this
state
law
alternative,
even
if
it
didn't
independently
violate
the
supremacy
clause
by
substituting
new
york's
judgment
for
that
of
congress,
would
not
actually
be
a
real
alternative
for
mr.
haywood
or
for
anyone
else
who
wanted
to
bring
a
suit
against
prison
officials.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
your
--
your
honor,
there
may
be
--
reasonable
minds
i
think
could
differ
about
whether
it's
preferable
to
have
the
state
as
a
solvent
entity
or
the
--
or
the
prison
employee
as
a
defendant.
but
i
think
there's
two
important
points
on
that.
number
one,
in
their
briefing,
the
respondents
have
argued
that
they
will
indemnify
state
employees
regardless
of
where
the
case
is
brought.
if
the
state
has
already
agreed
to
provide
indemnification,
then
you
don't
need
the
state
as
a
defendant
simply
to
be
solvent.
the
state
has
already--
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
--yes,
your
honor.
under
correction
law
section
24,
if
the
guard
is
acting
outside
the
scope
of
the
employment,
then
the
case
can
be
brought
in
new
york's
courts
of
general
jurisdiction.
the
important
point
here,
your
honors,
is
that
there
are
two
separate
related
reasons
that
this
law
is
unconstitutional.
the
first
is
because
new
york's
legislature
has
redefined
the
remedies
available
under
section
1983,
they
have,
in
effect,
substituted
their
judgment
about
what
constitutes
good
policy
for
congress's
judgment.
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
haywood
or
any
other
plaintiff
in
new
york
state
could
bring
a
section
1983
claim
in
state
court,
but
only
if
he
agrees
to
give
up
his
right
to
seek
money
damages.
congress
determined,
in
setting
forth
the
purpose
and
the
effect
of
section
1983,
that
plaintiffs
ought
to
be
entitled
to
both
money
damages
and
equitable
damages.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
your
honor,
it's
--
justice
scalia,
it's
absolutely
true
that
mr.
haywood
could
bring
his
case
in
federal
court
and
would
be
entitled
to
all
the
remedies
available
under
section
1983,
had
he
brought
it
in
federal
court.
but
that
issue
is
not
dispositive
in
this
case.
and
the
reason
it's
not
dispositive
is
that
in
the
whole
line
of
cases
that
this
court
has
considered
where
it
has
required
states
to
hear
actions
as
long
as
they
hear
similar
or
analogous
actions,
a
federal
forum
was
available
in
each
of
those
cases
as
well.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
your
honor,
under
this
court's
decisions
not
only
in
felder
but
going
back
to
martinez,
this
court
has
said
that
--
that
it
hasn't
decided
whether
a
state
is
required
to
create
a
court
to
hear
federal
claims.
and
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
issue
in
this
case,
because
new
york
has
already
established
courts
of
general
jurisdiction,
its
supreme
court,
the
trial
level
court,
that
are
competent
to
hear
these
cases.
these
courts
regularly
hear
common
law
tort
cases.
they
regularly
hear
section
1983
claims--
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
--your
honor,
that
seems
to
be
the
crux
of
the
respondents'
argument.
and
i
think
the
fundamental
problem
with
that
argument
is
that,
although
new
york
specifically
exempts
prison
--
cases
against
prison
officials,
that's
not
enough.
and
the
reason
it's
not
enough
is
that
if
you
can
merely
invoke
the
word
"jurisdiction",
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
howlett,
the
mere
--
the
force
of
the
supremacy
clause
is
not
so
weak
that
it
can
be
evaded
by
the
mere
mention
of
the
word
"jurisdiction".
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
points
on
that.
the
first
is
that
in
the
cases
where
this
court
has
found
that
there
was
a
neutral
jurisdictional
rule,
herb
v.
pitcairn,
douglas,
mayfield,
and
then
later
in
johnson
v.
fankell,
in
every
single
one
of
those
cases
the
underlying
rule
of
jurisdiction
did
not
speak
to
the
identity
of
the
parties
and
did
not
address
the
underlying
substance
of
the
claim.
those
were
rules
that
simply
talked
about
how
a
case
could
move
through
the
courts.
for
example,
in
douglas
neither
party
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york,
and
the
new
york
court
said:
if
you're
not
residents,
you
can't
come
in
and
use
our
courts.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
--
i
think
that
that's
exactly
right.
the
point
here
is
that
in
--
in
--
in
douglas,
where
the
court
did
not
--
where
the
new
york
courts
did
not
allow
any
party
--
where
both
parties
were
nonresidents
of
new
york,
they
wouldn't
hear
the
case
--
that
applied
regardless
of
the
identity
of
the
employee.
it
didn't
matter
whether
the
defendant
was
an
employee
of
the
state
of
new
york
or
not.
and
it
also
applied
regardless
of
what
the
underlying
substantive
claim
was.
it
didn't
matter
whether
it
was
a
tort
action
or
a
contract
action
or
anything
else.
if
you
weren't
in
new
york,
if
you
weren't
a
resident
of
new
york,
you
couldn't
take
advantage
of
its
--
of
its
courts.
and
in
--
in
herb
v.
pitcairn,
where
you
had
the
situation
where
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
railroad
accident
brought
in
one
county
court
in
illinois
--
it
should
have
been
brought
in
a
different
county
court
--
the
court
went
--
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
the
state
of
illinois
has
provided
other
forums,
other
state
courts
where
you
could
have
brought
this
case.
and
if
the
state,
for
example,
in
the
present
case
had
said,
mr.
haywood,
you
filed
this
case
in
wyoming
county
supreme
court
and
it
really
should
have
been
brought
down
in
syracuse,
that
would
be
a
neutral
rule
of
jurisdiction.
it
just
dictates
where
the
case
ought
to
be
brought.
by
contrast,
what
new
york
has
done
here
is
that
they
have
absolutely
forbidden
anyone
to
seek
money
damages
against
a
prison
official.
and
the
reason
that
they
did
that,
as
conceded
in
the
respondents'
briefing,
is
because
they
don't
want
prison
officials
to
be
distracted
from
their
duties.
they
don't
want
prison
officials
to
have
to
face
the
fear
of
vexatious
lawsuits.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
they
could.
once
the
state
--
this
court's
jurisprudence
teaches
us
that
once
a
court
--
once
a
state
opens
its
courts
to
hear
analogous
state
law
claims,
it
cannot
then
close
its
doors
selectively
to
federal
claims.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg;
certainly
the
state
of
new
york
could
offer
a
state
law
alternative
in
addition
to
section
1983.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
okay.
i
don't
believe,
justice
kennedy,
that
--
that
new
york
could
force
a
plaintiff
to
give
up
the
right
to
sue
section
--
sue
under
section
1983
if
the
--
if
the
courts
are
otherwise
open
to
tort
actions
in
similar
circumstances.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
no,
justice
kennedy.
once
--
once
new
york
establishes
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
that
are
competent
to
hear
these
kinds
of
cases,
it
can't
close
its
doors
to
section
1983
claims
for
money
damages.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
yes,
justice
scalia.
it--
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
distinction
is
--
relates
to
the
relative
power
of
congress
and
the
states.
once
congress
has
spoken
and
has
provided
a
federal
cause
of
action,
that
becomes
new
york
law.
and
new
york,
as
long
as
it
has
a
court,
is
required
to
enforce
that.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
justice
scalia,
i
--
i'm
not
sure
exactly
where
the
line
is
in
terms
of
the
analogy.
i
think
this
case
is
very
far
on
the
other
side.
in
other
words,
because
new
york
state
here
--
even
here,
a
section
1983
claim,
this
isn't
a
situation
where
they
say,
we
have
a
court
that's
not
competent
to
hear
section
1983
claims.
they
simply
say:
we're
not
going
to
allow
them
to
hear
section
1983
claims
for
money
damages
where
there
is
a
prison
official
who's
--
who's
the
defendant.
if
the
defendant
here,
justice
scalia,
were
a
police
officer
who
had
engaged
in
the
same
conduct,
new
york
state
courts
would
have
to
hear
that
case.
so
this
is
not
the
sort
of
thing--
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
--i
think
it
--
intellectually,
justice
scalia,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
distinction
is
that
--
that
there
has
to
be
a
point
at
which
you
do
respect
the
relative
authority
of
the
state
and
the
federal
governments.
by
saying
that
a
state
may
--
we
are
not
going
to
require
that
a
state
establish
a
court
to
hear
a
whole
kind
of
action
that
they
otherwise
wouldn't
hear.
that's
providing
some
deference
to
the
authority
of
the
state,
as
the
respondents
point
out,
part
of
the
core
sovereignty
of
the
state,
to
establish
their
courts
and
to
run
their
courts.
by
contrast,
once
they
have
done
that,
once
they
have
provided
that
court
system,
then
the
power
balance
shifts.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
your
honor,
i
think
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
that
would
--
if
the
state
of
new
york
said,
we
are
not
going
to
hear
any
kind
of
tort
action
regardless
of
whether
it's
federal
or
state,
and
it
doesn't--
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
--okay.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
as
long
as
--
as
long
as
the
withdrawal
of
jurisdiction
was
across
all
analogous
state
law
claims
as
well
as
the
federal
claim,
then,
yes.
i
mean,
we
could
discuss
whether
that
would
be
a
good
idea
or
not,
but
i
think--
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
--yes,
and
that's
--
that's
a
very
good
point,
justice
scalia.
and
this
court
has
told
us
as
litigants
what
it
thinks
are
analogous
claims.
in
felder,
this
court
said
an
analogous
claim
for
purposes
of
section
1983
is
a
common
law
tort.
that's
the
thing
that's
most
like
a
section
1983
claim.
so
the
real
question
here,
is
does
new
york
state
provide
courts
that
can
hear
common
law
tort
claims?
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
they
do.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
justice
ginsburg,
the
--
the
problem
with
that
analysis,
i
think,
is
that
in
the
court
of
claims,
there
are
all
sorts
of
other
limitations.
this
--
this
notion
that
this
is
simply
a
substitute
claim
and
that
it's
just
as
good
enough,
i
think
really
is
a
red
herring
in
this
case
because
what
has
happened
here
is
not
that
new
york
has
created
a
separate
court
with
specialized
expertise
that
knows
how
to
try
these
cases,
which
it
probably
could
do
under
this
court's
jurisprudence.
rather,
what
it
has
done
is
it's
required
you
to
sue
the
state
instead
of
the
individual,
and
then
put
a
whole
host
of
limitations
on
the
sort
of
relief
that
you
can
seek
and
on
the
way
that
you
can
bring
your
case.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
and
that's
absolutely
true,
justice
roberts,
if
the
claim
initially
were
a
claim
against
the
state.
but
of
course
section
1983
doesn't
provide
for
a
claim
against
the
state.
in
will
v.
michigan
this
court
held
that
the
state
is
not
a
person
for
purposes
of
section
1983,
and
so
the
only
way
you
can
have
a
section
1983
claim--
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
--and
your
honor,
that
is
absolutely
something
that
congress
can
decide
to
do
with
respect
to
federal
law,
and
new
york
can
decide
with
respect
to
state
law
to
do
whatever
it
wants
in
terms
of
setting
up
where
those
claims
can
go.
what
new
york
cannot
do
is
to
impose
that
policy
judgment
on
the
federal
claim,
because
congress
has
already
determined--
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
--regardless
of
how
rational
an
idea
this
is
or
how
good
an
idea
this
is,
for
this
court
to
adopt
a
rule
that
says
that
once
a
state
disagrees
with
congress
about
how
people
ought
to
be
liable
under
a
federal
remedy
would
require
this
court
in
essence
to
say
that
the
rationale
of
several
of
your
previous
cases
could
be
undone.
and
i
think
this
court
pointed
out
in
howlett
that
if
all
you
had
to
do
was
say,
our
courts
won't
have
jurisdiction
over
a
certain
category
of
claims,
that
the
wisconsin
legislature
in
felder
could
have
said:
our
courts
shall
have
no
jurisdiction
unless
there
is
120-day
notice
of
claim
provided.
the
courts
in
martinez
in
california
--
the
california
legislature
could
have
said,
our
state
courts
will
have
no
jurisdiction--
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
--i
think
that
if
this
court
found
that
this
were
a
jurisdiction
--
a
neutral
rule
of
jurisdiction
that
constituted
a
valid
excuse,
that,
yes,
that
would
probably
--
that
would
probably
undermine
my
argument
significantly.
i
think
to
get
there,
chief
justice,
you
would
have
to
--
you
would
have
to
sort
of
engage
in
some
interesting
thinking
which
i
haven't
gotten
my
mind
around,
to
be
quite
honest.
the
--
what
this
court
said
in
howlett
is,
when
we
talk
about
jurisdiction,
when
we
talk
about
what
constitutes
jurisdiction,
we
are
talking
about
whether
there
is
power
over
--
over
the
subject
matter
and
power
over
the
parties
involved.
and
i
don't
think
the
respondents
in
this
case
even
argue
that
the
new
york
supreme
courts
don't
have
the
power
over
the
parties
here
or
don't
have
competence
over
this
kind
of
subject
matter.
this
case
doesn't
have
any
of
the
attributes,
this
rule,
this
correctional
law
section
24,
doesn't
have
any
of
the
attributes
of
a
neutral
procedural
rule--
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
--justice
alito,
i
think
that
jurisdiction
--
that
to
determine
whether
a
rule
is
jurisdictional
requires
that
this
court
look
at
the
purpose
and
the
effect
of
the
underlying
statute.
and
if
all
a
state
has
to
do
is
say
it's
jurisdictional
and
if
jurisdiction
is
whatever
the
state
says
it
is,
then
that
means
that,
going
back
to
felder
and
martinez
and
some
of
those
cases,
a
state
could
--
could
evade
this
court's
rulings
merely
by
reframing
the
statute
in
the
words
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
well,
justice
alito,
the
--
the
important
points,
i
think,
come
out
of
--
out
of
felder:
that
it
is
a
neutral
rule
that
is
applicable
to
all
cases
and
that
is
not
concerned
with
the
underlying
substance
of
the
claim.
so,
for
example,
when
we
go
back
to
the
old
cases,
douglas,
mayfield,
herb
v.
pitcairn,
this
court
was
looking
at
situations
where
there
were
rules
that
applied
everywhere.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
well,
your
honor,
it
goes
to
the
substance
of
the
claim,
but
it
applies
generally
across
all
claims.
it's
not
--
it's
not
picking
and
choosing.
it's
not
targeted
towards
a
specific--
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
--well,
it's
picking
and
choosing
tort
claims
as
opposed,
i
suppose,
to
contract
claims.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
but
it's
not,
your
honor,
saying:
we're
going
to
accept
this
kind
of
tort
claim
but
not
that
kind
of
tort
claim.
we're
going
to
allow
to
you
sue
a
police
officer
who
beats
you
up,
but
you
can't
sue
a
corrections
officer
who
beats
you
up.
that's
the
real
difference,
i
think.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
yes,
justice
breyer.
i
think
that
if
i--
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
--i
think,
your
honor
--
i'd
have
to
get
the
exact
language
from
felder,
but
i
think
that
it
is
a
neutral
rule
regarding
the
administration
of
the
courts
that
is
unrelated
to
the
underlying
substance
of
the
matter
or
the
nature
of
the
parties.
your
honors,
the
most
recent
--
going
on
a
little
bit
about
this
jurisdictional
issue
--
the
most
recent
case
that
held
that
there
was
a
neutral
rule
of
judicial
administration,
a
neutral
procedural
rule,
was
johnson
v.
fankell.
and
this
court
will
recall
that,
in
that
case,
idaho
had
a
rule
that
required
that
there
be
a
final
judgment
before
an
intermediate
--
before
an
appeal
could
be
taken
from
that.
this
court
allowed
idaho
to
impose
that
rule
on
a
section
1983
claim
because
the
defendants
there
had
argued
that
they
were
entitled
to
qualified
immunity.
they
lost
at
the
trial
level.
they
then
sought
an
interlocutory
appeal.
and
this
court
said
certainly
idaho
can
set
forth
the
ways
in
which
you
take
appeal
from
any
kind
of
a
case,
and,
more
importantly,
this
is
not
a
rule
that's
targeted
at
civil
rights
claims
and
in
fact
may
lead
to
over-enforcement
of
civil
rights
claims
because
it
prevents
a
defendant
from
getting
out
of
the
case
very
early.
that's
the
kind
of
case
where
there's
a
neutral
rule.
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
in
johnson
v.
fankell,
i
believe--
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
--yes.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
it
was
that
the
idaho
courts
were
involved
in
that
one.
your
honor,
the
approach
that's
urged
by
the
respondents
in
this
--
in
this
case
really
would
dictate
different
results,
as
i
mentioned.
you'd
wind
up
--
in
felder
and
in
martinez,
the
courts
could
just
use
the
word
"jurisdiction".
and
actually,
even
if
you
go
back
to
three
of
this
court's
earlier
cases,
mondou
in
1912,
mcknett
in
1934,
testa
v.
katt
in
1947
--
in
testa
v.
katt,
this
court
required
connecticut
to
hear
an
emergency
price
control
act
even
though
connecticut
regularly
refused
to
hear
cases
that
they
thought
were
penal
in
nature.
and
what
this
court
said
was:
you
hear
analogous
claims;
you
have
to
hear
the
emergency
price
control
act.
now,
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
a
rule
that
the
state
could
simply
say,
we
have
no
jurisdiction
over
certain
categories
of
claims,
then
in
testa,
connecticut
could
simply
have
said:
we
are
not
going
to
have
jurisdiction
over
any
case
seeking
penal
or
punitive
types
of
damages.
that
would
require
that
we
really
undo
a
lot
of
this
court's
jurisprudence.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
point,
i
would
reserve
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
mr.
chief
justice,
just
very
briefly,
general
underwood
just
mentioned
that
--
that
this
could
be
analyzed
as
a
mandatory
removal
statute.
the
distinction,
your
honors,
is
that
what
new
york
state
does
when
it
removes
these
cases
to
federal
court
is
it
uses
an
avenue
that's
provided
by
congress.
and,
certainly,
if
congress
wants
to
provide
for
removal
to
federal
court,
congress
can
do
that.
what
the
state
cannot
do
is
come
in
and
interpose
its
policy
judgment
over
and
above
what
congress
has
decided
with
respect
to
federal
claims.
very
quickly,
i
would
like
to
address
a
second
point.
general
underwood
pointed
out
that
there
are
a
lot
of
large
prisons
in
rural
counties
in
new
york
state;
and,
therefore,
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
that
might
be
brought
in
those
courts.
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case,
your
honors,
that
if
new
york
wanted
to
have
a
statute
that
said
those
cases
will
be
transferred
to
the
less
busy
courts
of
our
state,
that
would
be
okay.
that
would
be
a
neutral
rule
of
judicial
administration
related
to
the
operation
of
the
courts
that's
unrelated
to
the
substance
or
the
identity
of
the
parties.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
well
--
well,
your
honor,
my
client
can't
bring
his
section
1983
claim
in
any
state
court
because
he
can't
bring
it
against
the
employees,
because
correctional
law
section
24
keeps
him
out
of
supreme
court,
and
he
can't
sue
the
state
in
the
court
of
claims
because
in
will
v.
michigan
this
court
said
the
state
is
not
a
person.
so
he
simply
cannot
bring
his
federal
action
in
any
state
court
if
he
wants
money
damages.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
well,
justice
scalia,
the
--
the
very
first
iteration
of
this
law
was
in
1947.
the
law
was
actually
amended
--
and
it's
discussed
in
the
joint
appendix
and
there's
some
in
the
beginning
of
our
brief
--
in
the
early
1970s
after
there
were
a
significant
number
of
--
of
section
1983
claims
that
had
begun
to
be
filed.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
recall
whether
there
were
any.
we
actually
researched
the
legislative
history
and
had
a
bit
of
difficulty
going
back
that
far.
i
don't
recall
whether
there
were
a
lot
of
substantive
changes
or
not,
quite
honestly.
this
is
a
statute,
though,
that
the
--
that
the
new
york
legislature
has
--
has
dealt
with
over
the
years.
one
of
the
important
things
is
that
in
the
1970s
--
and
i
apologize
for
not
having
the
exact
date
--
the
new
york
legislature
said
that
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
provide
immunity
to
corrections
officials.
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefing,
there
is
a
bill
currently
pending
before
the
new
york
legislature
that
says,
we
want
to
extend
the
same
immunity
that
we
provide
to
prison
officials
to
employees
of
the
office
of
mental
health--
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
--no,
justice
breyer.
the
--
the
reason
that
is
given
in
this
particular
case,
if
you
--
if
you
go
through
the
respondents'
briefing,
the
reason
that's
given
is
that
there
--
is
that
this
statute
exists
because
there
are
lots
of
frivolous,
vexatious
lawsuits.
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
and
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
the
reason?
mr.
jason
e.
murtagh
justice
breyer,
the
answer
is
that
the
state
can
certainly
do
that
with
respect
to
the
state-law
claims.
what
it
can't
do
is
try
to
shuttle
federal
claims
off
to
the
federal
courts
and
close
its
doors
where
it
hears
similar
state
claims.
your
honors,
thank
you
for
your
time.
