isn't
jurisdiction
whatever
the
legislature
says
it
is?
do
you
think
there
is
some
sort
of
--
you
know,
a
platonic
ideal
of
jurisdiction
versus
nonjurisdiction,
and
that's
what
we
apply
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
standard
for
determining
whether
it's
jurisdictional
or
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
a
state
extends--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--suppose
a
state
extends
sovereign
immunity
to
a
broad
class
of
state
employees
with
reference
to
state
law
claims.
would
that
mean
that
the
state
could
close
its
courts
to
all
1983
actions--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--against
those
same
defendants?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
they
phrase
it
in
terms
of
jurisdiction?
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
courts
of
new
york
to
hear
any
intentional
tort
action
against
a
correctional
official
for
action
taken
during
the
performance
of
the
correctional
officer's
duties.
do
they
then
close
the
new
york
courts
completely
to
1983
actions
against
correctional
officials?
