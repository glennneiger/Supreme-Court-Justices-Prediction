ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
constitution
permits
state
courts
to
hear
federal
claims,
but
it
does
not
require
a
state
to
hear
them
so
long
as
the
state
does
not
discriminate
against
federal
claims
in
comparison
with
similar
state
claims.
new
york's
statute
fully
satisfies
that
requirement.
new
york
courts
cannot
hear
damage
actions
against
prison
officials
for
conduct
in
the
scope
of
their
employment.
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
state
or
federal
law
is
the
basis
for
the
claim.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
that's
not
so.
this
court
has
in
fact
invalidated
statutes
and
found
discrimination.
there
were
--
three
of
the
early
fela
--
two
fela
cases
and
the
testa
case
itself.
in
testa,
contrary
to
what
was
just
suggested,
the
court
--
this
court
found
discrimination.
when
rhode
island
said
that
it
wasn't
going
to
hear
the
emergency
price
control
penal
statute--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
court--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no.
immunity--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no.
immunity
and
jurisdiction
are
really
quite
different.
they
both
have
the
result
that
the
defendant
loses.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
if
--
if
they
not
only
used
the
word
"jurisdiction"
but
gave
the
rule
jurisdictional
effect
--
that
is
to
say,
a
jurisdictional
bar
is
one
that
can't
be
waived
by
the
defendants;
whereas,
immunity
can
be
waived.
so
it
protects
courts,
not
defendants.
the--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
it's
not
just
any
form
of
relief.
it's
not
just,
for
instance,
the
type
of
damages.
the
difference
between
law
and
equity
has
a
long
tradition
in
this
country.
they
are
really
two
different
actions,
an
action
for
injunctive
relief
or
an
action
for
damages.
the
courts
now
hear
them
together.
but
what
new
york
has
said
is
it
has
no
jurisdiction
--
its
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
against
--
over
damage
actions
against
corrections
officials.
and
as
i
was
saying
earlier,
jurisdiction
is
different
from
immunity,
both
because
it
can't
be
waived
--
so
it's
about
the
courts,
not
the
defendants,
because
it
--
because
a
dismissal
won't
bar
litigating
the
matter
in
federal
court.
a
dismissal
--
an
immunity
would
result
in
a
judgment--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
don't
think
it's
immunity.
i
think
it's
a
refusal
to
hear
the
case--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
practical
difference--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--not
at
all.
this
is
like
a
forced
removal,
is
what
it
really
is.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
that's
exactly
--
yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
they
are
fully
liable
in
federal
court.
that's
where
these
cases
are
being
brought
right
now.
congress
has
never
expressed
any
policy
for
mandating
that
they
be
brought
in
state
court,
because
even
if
these
cases
could
have
been
brought
in
the
first
place
in
state
court,
the
federal
--
the
state
defendant
could
remove
it
to
federal
court.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
but
that's
if
the
court
is
open
to
the
case.
the
fender
cases
--
the
line
of
cases
that
petitioner
has
been
pointing
to,
is
simply
not
applicable
here
where
the
state
opens
its
courts
to
the
cases.
if
the
state
were
hearing
damage
actions
against
corrections
officers,
it
couldn't
give
them
immunity.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
have
three.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
first
of
all,
these
--
this
--
i
would
like
to
correct
an
observation.
this
is
--
this
is
not
aimed
only
or
even
principally
at
1983
actions.
this
law
does
predate
the
--
not
the
enactment
of
1983,
but
the
proliferation,
the
use
--
the
widespread
use
of
1983;
and
in
fact
it
affects
a
great
many
state
cases.
it's
not
only--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
prisons
are
large
institutions
in
rural
counties
that
generate
a
vast
amount
of
litigation.
this
particular
prisoner
was
in
a
prison
in
a
rural
county
like
wyoming
county
that
had
i
think
3,000
or
so
prisoners
in
it,
and
the
litigation
generated
by
the
prisons
isn't
just
actions
by
prisoners.
this
statute
doesn't
apply
only
to
actions
against
--
by
prisoners.
it
also
applies
to
actions
by
prison
employees
against
other
prison
employees
--
actions
by
anybody
against
a
corrections
official.
so
it's
all
the
vast
forms
of
litigation,
principally
but
not
exclusively
prisoner
complaints,
that
arise
out
of
prisons.
that
is
a
very
large
and
burdensome
amount
of
litigation,
unlike
litigation
against
the
state
police,
which
some
have
said
is
comparable,
which
is
dispersed
all
over
the
state.
this
is
concentrated
where
the
large
prisons
are,
and
it
is
a
reasonable
decision
--
a
neutral
reason,
if
you
will
--
for
the
state
to
decide
to
take
those
actions
out
of
the
courts
of
general
jurisdiction,
to
take
actions
--
damage
actions
arising
out
of
the
prisons
out
of
the
courts
of
general
jurisdiction,
where
it
would
be
concentrated
in
a
few
counties
where
the
large
prisons
are.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
and
i
don't
believe
that
this
court's
cases
about
jurisdiction,
as
distinguished
from
its
cases
about
case
handling
rules,
require
that
kind
of
neutral
administrative
feature.
i
only
was
suggesting
that
there
exists
such
an
explanation
for
this
rule,
but
in
fact
this
court
has
treated
quite
differently
cases
about
case
handling,
and
that
makes
sense.
because
if
you
hear
a
claim
--
if
the
state
courts
hear
a
claim
and
then
impose
even
a
nondiscriminatory
--
but
it's
certainly
a
discriminatory
rule
that
tends
to
defeat
the
claim,
the
state
might
induce
plaintiffs
to
bring
their
claims
in
state
court
and
then
lose
them
under
disadvantageous
procedures.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
think--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no,
i
don't
think
the
analysis
would
be
the
same.
i
think
once
the
state
opens
its
doors
to
a
damage
action
against
corrections
officials,
the
question
would
be
--
the
answer
might
or
might
not
come
out
the
same
way,
but
i
think
it
probably
would
come
out
differently.
the
--
the
question
would
be,
does
that
procedural
rule
--
there
are
two
questions:
is
it
discriminatory?
you're
saying
--
your
hypothetical
is
that
it's
not
discriminatory
as
between
state
and
federal.
and
the
second
question
would
be,
does
it
undermine
--
is
it
pre-emptive?
does
it
undermine
the
--
the
federal
claim?
and
so
in
martinez,
when
this
court
said
state
immunities
can't
apply
to
federal
1983
actions,
only
federal
immunities
can
apply,
the
court
was
careful
to
observe
that
california
had
opened
its
courts
to
this
case
and
had
an
immunity;
whereas--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
think
it
could
be
argued
--
i
think
it
would
be
argued
that
limiting
damages
undermines
a
federal
action
that
is
meant
to
provide--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
don't
believe
congress
has
made
that
judgment.
so
that
i
--
and
that's
my
answer
to
why
i
don't
think
this
undermines
a
federal
cause--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no,
the
purpose
of
1983
is
to
--
actually
was
two
things:
it
was
to
provide
a
federal
forum,
and
it
was
to
provide
compensation
for
these
torts.
and
i
believe
that
these--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
think
there's
no
federal
policy
that,
for
instance--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--he
is
responsible
to
exactly
the
same
degree
as
he
would
be,
were
he
sued
personally,
because
new
york
indemnifies
him
and
there
is
no
requirement
--
congress
has
never
shown
any
objection
to
indemnification.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
don't
know
that
our
case
turns
on
whether
there's
an
indemnification
agreement.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
to
the
extent
--
i
don't
believe
we
need
to
--
if
you
think
that
we
need
to
--
that
there
may
be
a
conflict
with
a
federal
policy
--
i
think
the
statute
stands
because
it's
nondiscriminatory
and
jurisdictional.
but
if
there
is
a
question,
a
further
question
of
whether
it
defeats--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
i
don't
think
so,
for
the
same
reason
that
i
don't
think
--
that
is,
if
you
have
a
tort
remedy
that
the
state
is
hearing,
then
a
limit
on
recovery
that
goes
--
that
is
inconsistent
with
congressional
policy
is
not
permitted.
but
if
the
state
were
to
say,
we
won't
hear
any
tort
cases
or
we
won't
hear
any
tort
cases
involving
railroads
or
we
won't
hear
any
tort
cases--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--state
or
federal.
there's
nothing
in
your
fela
cases
that
says
that
as
long
as
the
state
is
closing
its
doors
equally.
and
there
are,
of
course,
political
reasons--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
no,
but
--
but--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
don't
think
they
could
put
the
damage
requirement
on,
because
then
they
would
be
opening
the--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--they
could
totally
close
the
doors,
and
i
think
that's
different.
that
is
not
hearing
a
case,
and
in
closing
--
closing
the
doors
of
the
court
evenhandedly
to
state
and
federal
cases,
that
equality--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
think
the
fela
cases,
some
of
which
were
--
some
exclusions
were
upheld
and
some
of
which
were
struck
down,
support
our
position
because
they
only
strike
down
exclusions
of
jurisdiction
where
there
is
a
discrimination,
where
the
court
finds
a
discrimination
between
the
federal
and
state
claim.
in
mondou,
connecticut
was
hearing
suits
against
railroads
under
state
law.
it
was
even
hearing
suits
against
railroads
under
other
states'
law
that
imposed
fellow-servant
liability,
but
it
was
refusing
to
hear
only
suits
under
federal
law.
and
that's
why
the
court
struck
it
down.
similarly,
in
mcknett
and
testa,
in
each
case
this
court
struck
down
a
limitation
on
the
ground
not
that
the
state
had
an
absolute
obligation
to
hear
the
federal
claim,
but
that
it
had
an
obligation,
if
it
was
going
to
exclude
jurisdiction,
to
exclude
it
evenhandedly.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
but
what
--
but
what
this
court
pointed
to
in
testa
was
that
while
they
said
that,
they
did,
in
fact,
hear
double
damage
actions,
which
is
what
this
was.
it
was
penal
in
the
sense
not
of
being
criminal,
but
of
being
a
double
damage
--
a
multiple
damage
action.
and
what
the
court
said
was,
because
rhode
island
does
hear
double
damage
actions
arising
under
its
own
law
and
under
the
federal
fair
labor
standards
act,
essentially
the
rationale
they
gave
for
excluding
the
emergency
price
control
act
had
been
proven
false
and
must
--
and
left
as
the
only
explanation
unwillingness
to
enforce
the
emergency
price
control
act.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
or
--
or
we
offer
them
a
court
of
claims.
that--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it's
a
different
action.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
they
aren't
--
this
is
what
i
can
tell
you.
i
think
--
1983,
they
are
--
i
mean,
suits
against--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--they
do
bring
them
only
in
federal
court.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
what
i
can
tell
you
is
that
there
are
a
great
many
state
law
--
i
can't
tell
you
numbers.
there
are
a
great
many
state
law
actions
against
corrections
officers.
they
are
either
in
the
court
of
claims
or
they
are
in
federal
court
because
this
statute
says
that
the
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
damage
actions,
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
are
1983
or
state
law.
but
there
are
a
great
many
--
i
mean,
it
stands
to
reason:
the
state
law
actions
--
there
are
many
state
law
actions
that
can't
be
constitutionally
characterized.
there's
all
kinds
of,
you
know,
damage
and
loss
to
property,
medical
malpractice,
negligence,
failure
to
protect
from
harm,
things
that
--
many
things
that
the
prisoners
bring
suits
against
that
are
not
constitutional.
they
aren't
in
the
supreme
court.
they
would
be
if
you
struck
this
statute
down.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
there
are
two
things
to
say
about
punitive
damages:
one
is
that,
yes
--
there
are
three
things:
there
are
no
punitive
damages
in
the
court
of
claims.
punitive
damages,
of
course,
are
available
in
federal
court,
which
is
fully
available
to
these
plaintiffs
and
is
where
they
normally
are,
particularly
if
they
think
they
have
a
punitive
damage
claim.
it
is
also
the
case
that
actions
outside
the
scope
of
employment
are
not
covered
by
this
statute.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
they
could
be
brought
in
the
state
supreme
court.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
it's
--
it
is
a
jurisdiction
--
it
is
framed
as
jurisdictional.
it
is
treated
as
jurisdictional.
the
new
york
courts
say--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no,
because
what
the
jurisdictional
bar
is
for
damage
actions
against
corrections
officers
for
actions
in
the
scope
of
their
employment
--
and
the
new
york
courts
don't
just
say
it's
jurisdictional.
they
give
it
the
effect
of
a
jurisdictional
bar.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
think--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
think
it
would
be
hard
to--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--to
find
a
rationale
for
it,
but--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
was
going
to
say,
i
don't
think
its
flaw
is
that
it's
not
jurisdictional.
its
flaw
is
that
it's
irrational.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
or
discriminatory
as
between
--
as
between
plaintiffs,
yes.
but--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
would
call
it
very
strange
jurisdiction.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
it--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
unlike
the
wednesday
case,
our
statute
is
rational
because
it
takes
out
of
the
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
the
cases
that
are
most
numerous
and
that
are
most
appropriately
indemnified--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--by
the
state,
but
it
leaves
in
the
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
the
ones
that
are
less
numerous
and
that
are
not
appropriately
indemnified
or
turned
into
actions
against
the
state.
so
it's
rational
unlike
the
wednesday
cases.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
there's
a
body
of
cases
that
is
quite
generous
in--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
relatively
clear
on
this.
the
kinds
of
cases
that
are
outside
the
scope
of
employment
are
prisoner
rapes
and
things
that
are
done
that
do
not
--
by
corrections
officers,
that
do
not
in
any
way
further
the
--
the
objective.
they
are
simply
excesses.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
because
they
are
not
appropriately
--
because
the
state
doesn't
want
to
take
responsibility
--
when
the
same
statute
that
takes
them
out
the
supreme
court
says
actions
for
such
matters
can
be
brought
against
the
state
in
the
court
of
claims,
and
the
state
is
not
taking
responsibility
for
those
cases
and
will
not
indemnify
them.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
the
statute
was
first
enacted
in
--
in
about
1947
or
so.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it
was
not
aimed
at
--
it
wasn't--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--correct.
ms.
barbara

it

the
rise
of
federal
1983
actions
came
subsequently,
and
they
then--
ms.

--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
ms.

there
may
be,
but
there's
no--
ms.
barbara

underwood
--1983
does
not
allow
any
liability.
1983
has
been
construed
not
--
the
state
isn't
a
person;
it
can't
be
a
defendant.
ms.

the

ms.

or
any

under
1983,
you
can
get
damages
against--
ms.

no,
not
--
not
against
the

ms.

yes.
in
fact,
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
that
one
of
the
things
that
shows
that
there's
no
congressional
policy
focused
only
on
individuals
is
that
municipalities
and
other
government
entities
are
proper
defendants.
the
state
is
not.
likely,
the
government
--
the
federal
policy
was
--
policy
found
by
this
court
in
construing
1983
for
not
making
the
state
a
defendant
was
not
that
that
would
undermine
deterrence
and
that
it
was
preferable
to
sue
individuals,
but
that
there
was
some
reluctance
--
concern
about
power
or
wisdom
of
imposing
liability
on
the
states.
and,
in
fact,
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
monell
and
will
about
why
the
state
is
not
a
person.
so
i
don't
think
1983
is
fairly
read
as
embracing
a
congressional
judgment
that
it's
better
to
have
liability
against
individuals,
better
from
the
plaintiffs'
point
of
view,
than
against
the
state.
but
the
way
this
works
is
it
is,
in
effect,
a
--
a
mandatory
removal.
and
since
congress
has
no
objection,
has
not
prohibited
removal
the
way
it
did
in
fela
cases,
it's
hard
to
see
how
the
congressional
policy
is
frustrated
by
this
mandatory
removal.
