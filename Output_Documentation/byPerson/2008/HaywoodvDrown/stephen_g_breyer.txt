justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
something
you
add
--
you
add
to
your
statement
of
your
rule?
a
neutral
rule
not
related
to
substance,
but
related
to
the
administration
of
the
courts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
don't
just
be
agreeable
to
be
agreeable.
do
cases
actually
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
what
is
the
neutral
reason
related
to
the
administration
of
courts
that
leads
the
state
to
close
its
door
to
a
damage
suit
under
1983
against
correctional
officers--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--taking
as
the
assumption
exactly
what
justice
ginsburg
said?
i
mean,
i
can't
find
any
reason
that's
neutral
and
administrative
other
than
what
justice
ginsburg
said,
which
is
neither:
namely,
new
york
does
not
like
1983
actions
for
damages
against
correctional
officers.
what
other
reason
is
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
--
but
testa
and
katt
was
a
case
in
which
the
court
found
that
the
state
allows
some
state
actions
that
are
analogous
to
the
federal
action
and
you
can't
discriminate
against
a
federal
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
not
that
case.
this
is
a
case
where
the
state
doesn't
allow
--
doesn't
allow
--
damage
actions
like
the
federal
action.
and
this
court
has
not
decided
to
my
knowledge
how
we
apply
the
basic
rule
in
such
a
situation.
so
i
would
think
that
the
way
we
would
apply
it
is
take
the
standard
and
ask
the
state,
what
is
the
neutral
administrative-related
reason?
because
what
they
are
saying
is,
if
you
look
at
this,
from
an
administrative
point
of
view,
it's
that
red-haired,
one-eyed
man
with
a
limp.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
you
have
now
is
you
have
one
reason,
i
think,
would
be
clearly
wrong,
i
think
--
i
assume
that.
but
if
the
state
closed
their
doors
to
this
kind
of
suit
because
they
said,
we
think
our
correctional
officers
should
be
immune
from
damages,
now
we
know
they
can
get
money
under
the
federal
law,
but
we
want
nothing
to
do
with
this.
that,
i
think,
would
be
discrimination
against
the
suit
if
that
were
their
reason.
now,
there's
a
neutral
reason,
an
administrative,
and
it
is,
well,
you
see,
there
are
just
too
many
--
there
are
just
too
many
lawsuits
by
prisoners
against
prison
officials.
and
we
don't
want
all
that
business
in
that
court,
and
here's
how
we
deal
with
it:
one,
we
take
away
their
cause
of
action,
that's
what
we
do
under
state
law,
and
then
we
--
the
feds
--
we
throw
them
back
to
fed
court.
now,
that
might--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
don't
offer
them
a
court
of
claims,
because
what
you
offer
in
the
court
of
claims
is
an
action
against
the
state.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
can
say
that
isn't
a
big
deal
because,
after
all,
most
of
these
really
are
actions
against
the
state
anyway
because
they
get
compensated.
okay.
so
if
i
treat
that
as
neutral,
i
have
one
bad
reason
and
one
good
reason.
and
how
do
i
know
which
is
which?
that
is,
is
it
really
true
that
there
are
a
lot
of
suits
brought
in
state
courts
in
places
with
prisons
under
1983
for
damages
rather
than
federal
courts?
i
don't
know
what
the
numbers
are?
have
you
looked
them
up
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
1983
actions,
but
maybe
they
bring
them
mostly
in
federal
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
--
so
one
way
to
test
this
out
would
be
the
following:
if
we
had
numbers
and
knew,
you
know,
about
how
many
state
--
how
many
damage
actions
against
prisoners
were
being
brought
in
state
courts
in
districts
that
have
prisons
there,
and
then
we
saw
how
much
new
york
was
really
hurt,
and
then
we
asked
another
question,
maybe
there
is
some
federal
security
actions,
you
see,
where
there's
no
state
comparable
action,
and
we
found
out,
well,
the
state
lets
them
bring
these
actions
in
state
court.
so,
there
are
ways
of
dealing
with
this
empirically.
have
you
any
sense
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
saying
--
they're
also
saying
there's
a
--
there's
a
neutral
reason.
the
neutral
reason
is
the
state
sees
there
are
just
too
many
cases
in
which
prisoners
are
suing
correctional
officials.
so
then
they
say:
here's
what
we
are
going
to
do
about
it.
first,
under
state
law,
we'll
wipe
out
all
the
suits
and
give
them
instead
an
action
against
the
state.
but
we
know
there
are
still
some
federal
cases
about
the
same
thing.
so
what
we're
going
to
do
is
we're
going
to
say
bring
them
in
federal
court.
why
bring
them
in
state
court?
so
now
we've
dealt
with
our
administrative
problem.
so
that's
their
neutral
administrative
reasons.
now,
people
would
like
to
bring
1983
actions
still
in
state
or
federal
court.
it
may
be
more
convenient.
they
get
attorneys'
fees,
and
the
attorneys'
fees
you
don't
get
under
the
state
law.
so
why
isn't
--
or
why
is
--
or
i
guess
that's
the
question
for
me:
is
this
an
adequate,
neutral,
administrative
reason
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
forget
all
of
the
characterizations.
if
we
could
look
into
the
motives,
maybe
we'd
have
a
different
view,
but
all
we
have
is
the
statute
on
the
books.
and,
as
in
many
cases,
the
people
who
are
charged
with
defending
those
statutes
think
of
very
good
reasons
which
are
very
plausible
that
could
have
motivated
the
people
involved,
and
they've
come
up
with
the
one
that
you
have
heard.
now,
what's
--
what's
wrong
with
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
is,
you
see,
there
are
so
many
cases
in
which
the
person
is
suing
--
the
prisoner
is
suing
the
prison
officials
that
our
courts
are
clogged.
so
what
we
are
going
to
do
is:
one,
give
the
prisoners
a
good
remedy
under
state
law
in
a
different
court;
and,
two,
close
our
doors
to
the
comparable
federal
cases.
