chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-10374,
haywood
v.
drown.
mr.
murtagh.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
except
--
they
said
except
in
cases
where
the
guards
are
acting
outside
the
scope
of
their
employment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
there's
a
difference.
i
mean,
obviously
felder
is
a
significant
help
to
you.
but
i
suppose
it's
a
difference
to
say
they've
redefined
the
cause
of
action
under
federal
law
and
said
they
are
just
not
going
to
hear
it
at
all.
it
may
seem
paradoxical,
but
the
latter
may
be
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view
the
--
the
sounder
characterization
because
it's
obviously
not
the
responsibility
or
the
authority
of
states
to
say,
well,
this
is
how
the
federal
law
is
going
to
be
applied.
but
it
might
be
their
--
their
--
within
their
authority
to
say,
look,
this
is
what
our
state
court
system
provides,
and
if
you
don't
like
it
for
a
federal
claim,
you've
always
got
the
federal
courts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
but
they're
not
really
--
or
at
least
you
can
view
it
as
they
are
not
discriminating
against
the
federal
cause
of
action,
because
they
don't
allow
the
state
cause
of
action
of
the
sort
you
want
to
pursue
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
true.
and
howlett
does
say
that.
but
as
we've
pointed
out
on
many
occasions,
"jurisdiction"
is
a
term
that
covers
a
lot
of
different
things.
and
at
some
point
something
starts
to
look
jurisdictional,
which
is,
look,
we're
not
going
to
hear
your
case
at
all.
in
other
areas,
even
if
they
call
it
"jurisdictional",
it
really
doesn't
seem
that
way,
such
as,
well,
you've
got
to
give
this
much
notice
or
you've
got
to
--
you
know,
maybe
those
things
aren't
really
jurisdictional.
but
saying
you
can't
bring
the
case
at
all
strikes
me
as
really
jurisdictional.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
this
were
at
the
--
the
beginning
of
whenever
new
york
was
establishing
a
court
system,
and
they
said
from
the
outset,
look,
we
are
not
going
to
hear
these
types
of
cases
against
--
then
this
would
be
okay?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
that's
mixing
the
two
points.
your
point,
i
understand
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
once
the
court
has
opened
it
up
to
a
particular
type
of
claim,
they
can't
say
--
say
no
more.
so
if
they
are
setting
up
--
obviously
we
are
not
going
to
go
back
to
whenever
the
new
york
state
courts
was
established.
but
if
they
suddenly
said,
we
are
going
to
revise
our
court
system
or
--
or
modernize
it,
and
from
now
on
we
are
not
going
to
do
this,
is
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
it's
done
exactly
what
the
federal
system
has
done.
so
that
if
you
have
a
money
claim
against
--
that
is
going
to
be
against
the
federal
government,
here's
what
you
do:
you
go
to
the
court
of
claims,
you
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims;
and
in
that
court
all
sorts
of
special
rules
apply
about
notice
and
other
things.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
in
the
federal
system,
if
you
sue
a
federal
official
or
a
postman
and
in
fact,
in
reality
it's
going
to
be
a
claim
against
the
united
states,
that
has
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims,
too.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
my
point
is
that
there's
nothing
fishy
about
what
new
york
has
done
here,
which
leads
me
to
think,
well,
maybe
it's
not
really
discrimination
against
the
federal
claim;
it's
a
rational
way
to
handle
claims
against
the
state
treasury,
just
as
the
federal
system
is
a
rational
way
to
handle
claims
against
the
federal
treasury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
just
gets
back
to
our
previous
colloquy
about
what
jurisdiction
is
and
what
it
means.
i
mean,
are
you
saying
that
if
we
look
at
this
and
we
decide,
yes,
this
does
really
look
like
jurisdiction
in
the
real
sense,
rather
than
just
a
jurisdictional
label
--
if
we
do
that,
then
you
lose?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
murtagh.
ms.
underwood.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
murtagh,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
also
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
the
case
07-10374,
haywood
versus
drown.
