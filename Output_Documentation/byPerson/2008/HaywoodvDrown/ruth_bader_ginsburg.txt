justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not
how
it
moves
through
the
courts.
that
is,
you
don't
have
a
forum.
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
jurisdictional
ruling.
those
cases
that
say,
our
courts
don't
sit
to
hear
cases
where
the
parties
are
nonresidents,
both
sides;
our
courts
don't
sit
to
hear
cases
about
accidents
that
happened
in
timbuktu
--
those
sound
like
we
don't
offer
a
forum
for
that
type
of
case,
as
distinguished
from
here,
where
new
york
does
have
a
forum;
it
just
won't
give
one
kind
of
relief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
justice
kennedy
has
asked
you:
say,
you
could
have
this
federal
claim,
but
we
are
going
to
offer
you
a
substitute
under
new
york
law,
which
the
federal
authority
could
not
force
us
to
do,
because
it's
a
state
waiving
its
sovereign
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
why
can't
new
york
take
the
position,
we
want
to
be
realistic
about
these
suits?
new
york
has
provided
that
it
is
going
to
--
it's
going
to
pick
up
the
tab.
if
you
sue
a
correctional
officer,
new
york
is
going
to
pick
up
the
tab.
now
--
so
we
are
going
to
channel
this
suit
to
the
court,
the
one
court
in
the
state
that
deals
with
the
state,
the
sovereign,
paying
money,
the
court
of
claims.
and
so
all
they
are
doing
is
recognizing
the
reality
that
this
is
a
suit
against
new
york,
not
the
correctional
officer
because
it
won't
cost
the
correctional
officer
a
dime;
new
york
is
going
to
provide
counsel
and
is
going
to
pay
any
judgment.
so
that
really
where
this
case
belongs
is
in
the
court
that
hears
claims
against
the
state
of
new
york.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
underwood,
there's
a
feature
of
this
case,
even
assuming
that
you
were
right
about
--
new
york
has
not
withdrawn
jurisdiction
from
its
courts
over
a
1983
claim;
it
has
simply
limited,
taken
away,
one
mode
of
relief.
that
is,
you
can
sue
a
correctional
official
for
declaratory
relief,
you
could
sue
for
injunctive
relief.
all
new
york
has
taken
away
is
one
mode
of
relief.
that's
not
jurisdictional
unless
you
say
that
every
element
of
damages
is
jurisdictional.
new
york
allows
this
type
of
claim
in
their
courts.
we
are
talking
about
jurisdiction
over
the
person?
yes,
they
have
jurisdiction
over
the
correctional
official's
person.
subject
matter
--
subject
matter
is
a
1983
case?
yes.
all
they
are
cutting
off
is
one
form
of
relief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
practically
--
practically,
hasn't
what
new
york
has
done
is
to
confer
on
its
correctional
officers
absolute
immunity,
not
merely
qualified
immunity?
so
if
you
want
to
be
realistic
about
what
is
the
effect
of
new
york's
law,
it
says:
you
are
going
to
be
subject
to
equitable
relief,
declaratory
relief,
but
as
far
as
money
is
concerned,
you
are
absolutely
immune.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what's
the
difference
of
--
practically?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
the
--
isn't
the
practical
effect
--
if
you
tried
to
explain
to
correctional
officers
what
is
your
exposure,
you
would
say:
you
have
absolute
immunity
from
anything
that's
going
to
try
to
reach
into
your
pocket.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
theory
was
that
in
our
federal
system,
federal
law
is
state
law,
too?
that
is
the
highest
law
for
a
state.
federal
law
by
virtue
of
the
supremacy
clause
is
state
law,
and
sometimes
congress
creates
an
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
over
certain
types
of
claims.
but
if
congress
doesn't
do
that,
the
assumption
is
there's
concurrent
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
in
testa
the
state
said:
we
are
evenhanded;
we
don't
bring
--
we
don't
allow
penal
actions
to
be
--
to
be
brought
on
the
civil
side
of
our
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
any
substantive
change
from
what
the
original
enactment
to
the
amendment
--
from
the
one
that's
currently
enforced?
