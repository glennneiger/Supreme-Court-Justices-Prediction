justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
underwood,
if
that's
going
to
be
the
criterion,
that
they
exclude
a
state
cause
of
action
as
readily
as
they
exclude
a
federal
cause
of
action,
then
isn't
the
state
always
going
to
win
every
case
in
which
there
is
an
issue
like
this
one?
because
unless
the
state
is
--
is
so
blatantly
discriminatory
or
so
blatantly
inadvertent
as
to
leave
a
cause
of
action
of
its
own
making
on
the
books,
when
it
says
we
won't
hear
the
federal
one,
what
you
posit
is
always
going
to
be
the
case.
and
if
that's
--
if
the
rule
is
that
as
long
as
there
is
no
state
action
comparable
to
the
federal
action
that
is
disallowed,
the
state
wins.
in
practical
terms,
the
state
always
wins.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
not
really
that
they
are
not
the
supreme
court,
but
the
--
the
damages
are
limited,
aren't
they?
because
in
the
court
of
claims,
as
i
understand
it
or
under
the
statute,
there
can't
be
any
punitive
damages;
whereas,
if
it
were
a
straight
1983
action
in
the
state
supreme
court,
punitive
damages
would
--
would
be
a
possibility.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
could
be
brought
in
the
state
supreme
court--
justice
david
h.
souter
--which
is
a
--
which
is
one
of
your
jurisdictional
problems
because
the
--
the
--
in
effect,
new
york
is
saying
the
most
--
the
most
egregious
class
of
cases,
the
cases
in
which
the
correctional
officers
are
not
only
doing
something
actionable
but
something
that's
even
outside
the
scope
of
their
duty,
well,
we
will
hear
them;
they
are
fine.
and
we
will
provide
punitive
damages
for
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
--
which
makes
it
a
little
tough
to
say
that
in
the
less
egregious
cases
there's
a
--
that
the
exclusion
of
the
less
egregious
cases
is
a
jurisdictional
exclusion
as
distinct
from
an
exclusion
based
upon
policy
about
how
less
egregious
cases
ought
to
be
handled.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
aren't
you
simply
saying,
look,
we
go
around
calling
it
"jurisdictional".
and
--
and
my
point
was
that
isn't
it
difficult,
isn't
it,
in
fact,
inappropriate
to
call
it
1983
which
the
state
supreme
courts
hear,
and
there
is,
nonetheless,
a
second
class
of
cases,
also
1983
--
they
simply
happen
to
be
less
egregious
--
that
they
won't
hear?
isn't
it
difficult,
using
"jurisdictional"
in
the
normal
sense
of
the
term,
to
say
that
is
a
jurisdictional
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the
new
york
legislature
passed
a
statute
saying
the
--
the
state
supreme
court
will
not
have
jurisdiction
over
1983
actions
for
--
for
harm
committed
on
wednesday?
would
you
say
that
that
was
a
jurisdictional
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'll
answer
--
i'll
answer
the
question
for
you,
if
you
want.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
you
wouldn't
have.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
say
it
was
jurisdictional
so
long
as
the
supreme
court
said
--
so
long
as
the
state
legislature
said,
no
state
or
federal
actions
for
--
for
--
for
wednesday
damages?
would
you
call
that
jurisdictional?
no,
you
would
call
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
might
call
it
crazy
outside
of
court,
but
the
one
thing
you
wouldn't
do
is
walk
into
court
and
say
it's
jurisdictional.
and
the
--
my
--
the
point
that
i
am
getting
at
is
the
finer
the
comb
that
--
that
--
that
keeps
a
certain
class
of
case
out,
the
less
plausible
it
is
to
say
that
this
is
a
jurisdictional
kind
of
criterion
at
work
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
what
i
--
that's
why
i
keep
getting
at
the
point
that
when
--
when
you
lay
in
some
1983
actions,
the
worst
ones,
the
ones
with
the
highest
potential
damages,
but
you
say,
well,
the
less
awful
ones,
the
ones
that
may
be
within
the
scope
of
employment,
they
can't
come
in,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
that
the
teeth
on
the
comb
are
getting
rather
fine,
and
in
terms
of
our
normal
usage
in
--
in
applying
this
criterion,
it
is
not
plausibly
jurisdictional.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
are
they
--
why
are
they
left
in
the
supreme
court?
