justice

kennedy
it
does
provide
for
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
says
that
the
state
will
respond
in
damages.
it
might
be
--
i'm
not
sure
--
that
many
prisoners
would
prefer
this.
they've
got
a
solvent
--
i
hope
they're
solvent
--
defendant.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
can
just
mark
that
place
in
the
record.
it
--
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
is
some
real
benefits
to
the
prisoners
under
--
under
the
new
york
scheme.
it's
--
many
counsel
may
think
it's
preferable
than
to
sue
under
1983.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
--
the
new
york
legislature
said,
you
have
a
choice,
you
can
bring
a
1983
suit
or
you
can
bring
this
sort
of
suit
against
the
state,
and
the
state
will
respond
to
damages,
but
you
can't
do
both.
could
they
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
i
said
in
the
alternative.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
now,
suppose
they
do
it
--
they
say:
we
are
just
talking
about
the
state
courts.
you
can't
bring
both
types
in
state
courts.
you
can
still
have
your
federal
cause
of
action
in
the
federal
court,
and
we
will
also
give
our
cause
of
action
where
the
state's
law
is
violated,
but
not
both
in
the
new
york
courts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
being
generous
when
you
said
that
we
would
recall
--
at
least
that
i
would
recall
the
case.
is
it
idaho,
did
you
say,
or
johnson?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
was
johnson.
i
thought
you
said
idaho.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
the
state
of
new
york
said
that
in
suits
against
corrections
--
against
the
corrections
department,
against
the
state,
there
should
be
no
damages
awarded
to
a
prisoner
in
excess
of
$3,000,
and
then
--
and
then
--
and
then
the
prisoner
tries
to
bring
a
1983
suit
in
state
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the
case
--
would
the
analysis
be
just
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
my
hypothetical,
do
you
think
it
undermines
the
federal
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
can't
it
be
argued
here
that
congress
has
an
important
mechanism
in
holding
prison
officials
--
prison
correctional
officers
--
personally
liable,
so
that
they
are
themselves
aware
that
they
have
a
constitutional
obligation
that
is
enforceable
against
them,
and
new
york
has
taken
this
away?
now,
you
may
--
we
may
argue
that
if
the
state
responds
in
damages,
the
prisoner
is
better
off,
but
congress
has
not
made
that
judgment.
congress
has
made
the
judgment
that
the
correctional
officer
himself
or
herself
should
be
responsible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
it
has
made
that
judgment.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
1983.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
the
correctional
officer,
under
the
scheme
we
are
talking
about,
is
not
responsible
in
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
does
your
case
turn
on
whether
or
not
there
is
an
indemnification
agreement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
shouldn't
think
so.
that
hasn't
been
your
argument
so
far.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
one
--
one
of
the
concerns
i
have
in
this
case
is
scope
of
employment
is
often
litigated,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
state
of
new
york
might
routinely
say,
oh,
this
is
not
within
the
scope
of
employment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
--
which
means
that
this
is
a
very
difficult
distinction
to
work
with
and
is
a
further
burden
on
the
1983
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
that's
a
rather
routine
defense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
1983
does
not
--
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
--
does
not
allow
punitive
damages
against
a
state,
does
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
--
not
if
--
if
i
got
it
right
--
not
if
monell--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
even
if
monell
--
even
if
monell,
there's
no
--
there's
no
punitive
damages
against
the
state,
which
is
another
reason
in
which
you're
discriminating
against
the
employee
here
--
against
the
prisoner--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
the
prisoner
can
get
punitive
damages
against
the
correctional
officer
but
not
against
the
state
in
either
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
neither
court
can
you
get
--
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
--
punitive
damages
against
the
state.
you
can
never
have
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can
under
monell.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
that
same
act,
they
might
rescind
the
--
the
law
allowing
the
state
to
respond
in
damages,
in
which
case
you
won't
have
gained
very
much.
