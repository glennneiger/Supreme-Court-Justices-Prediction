justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--just
to
ask
you
an
offshoot
of
justice
kennedy's
question.
supposing
you
had
a
statute
that
said
in
railroad
cases
there
shall
be
no
damage
--
in
railroad
tort
cases
brought
by
employees
of
railroads,
there
shall
be
no
damage
judgment
in
excess
of
$10,000
in
state
court.
would
that
be
okay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
think
--
consistently
with
our
fela
cases,
it
could
have
a
rule
that
no
tort
--
no
tort
cases
may
be
brought
by
railroad
employees
against
the
railroad
in
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
couldn't
close
the
federal
doors
under
the
fela.
they
surely
could
bring
the
suit
in
the
federal--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you're
saying
they
could
shut
the
state
--
close
the
state
courts
to
suits
against
railroads
where
the
damage
--
for
cases
over
$10,000?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
could
totally
close
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
leave
the
door
open
to
suits
against
every
other
possible
defendant
except
railroads?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
your
hardest
case
is
really
the
fela
cases
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
it
had
not
even
been
held
then
that
state
farm
was
available
for
1983
actions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
don't
sue
illinois;
they
sue
cook
county--
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
state
court
for
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york.
petitioner,
a
prison
inmate
filed
two
1983
actions
against
several
correction
officials
alleging
that
they
violated
his
civil
rights.
he
filed
his
claims
in
the
state
supreme
court
which
is
the
trial
court
in
new
york
and
sought
punitive
damages
and
attorney's
fees.
the
trial
court
dismissed
the
action
on
the
ground
that
under
new
york's
correction
law
section
24,
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
entertain
any
suit,
federal
or
state
seeking
money
damages
from
correction
officers.
on
appeal,
petitioner
argued
that
correction
law
section
24
has
jurisdiction
limitation
interfered
with
section
1983
and
therefore
violated
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
disagreed.
it
held
that
because
the
law
treats
federal
and
state
damage
actions
against
correction
officials
equally,
it
should
be
considered
a
valid
excuse
for
the
state's
refusal
to
entertain
petitioner's
federal
cause
of
action.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
correction
law
violates
the
supremacy
clause.
the
law
is
motivated
by
new
york's
belief
that
damages
suits
filed
by
prisoners
against
correction
officers
are
by
and
large
frivolous
and
that
the
state
actor
should
be
shielded
from
liability.
the
fact
that
new
york
has
chosen
to
effectuate
this
policy
goal
by
selectively
withdrawing
jurisdiction
from
its
courts
overall
such
to
suits,
federal
and
state
does
not
alter
our
supremacy
clause
analysis.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia,
and
justice
alito
have
joined
part
iii
of
that
opinion.
