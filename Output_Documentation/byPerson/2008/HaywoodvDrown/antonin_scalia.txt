justice
antonin
scalia
he
can
still
get
that
in
federal
court,
can't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
okay
for
the
state
to
say,
we
don't
want
any
tort
actions
in
our
courts?
that
would
be
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
strange.
why
--
but
it
can't
do
the
lesser
thing
of
saying,
we
don't
want
this
particular
type
of
tort
action.
the
one
is
jurisdictional
--
you
would
say
it's
jurisdictional,
right?
and
this
one
is
not
jurisdictional,
just
because
it's
narrower?
it's
still
directed
to
the
type
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
not
if
new
york
says,
we
don't
want
any
tort
actions.
what
about
if
new
york
says,
we
don't
want
any
personal
injury
tort
actions?
would
that
be
enough,
or
is
that
too
narrow?
and
i'm
going
to
narrow
it
down
after
that
until
i
get
down
to
your
case.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
i
just
don't
understand
--
you
acknowledge
it's
okay
if
it's
jurisdictional,
and
you
acknowledge
that
it
is
jurisdictional
if
you
don't
allow
any
tort
actions.
i
just
don't
know
what
makes
this
to
be
non-jurisdictional.
what
--
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
we
would
discuss
what
is
analogous.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
--
you've
acknowledged
that
it
would
be
okay
and
would
be
a
jurisdictional
rule
if
the
court
--
if
the
state
courts
did
not
entertain
tort
actions.
that's
a
rule
that
goes
to
the
substance
of
the
claim,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
it's
picking
and
choosing
tort
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
--
they
are
liable
in
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
certainly
not
immune
in
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
underwood,
your
friend
on
the
other
side
acknowledges
that
if
new
york
state
closed
its
courts
to
tort
actions,
that
would
be
okay.
but
i
don't
see
how
closing
your
courts
to
tort
actions
has
any
administrative
--
particular
administrative
rationale
behind
it,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
still
responsible,
right?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he's
still
responsible.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
it
were,
it
would
be
discriminatory
and
invalid,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
discriminatory.
it's
picking
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--general
underwood,
when
--
when
was
this
statute
first
enacted?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
there
were
not
--
1983
was
on
the
books,
but,
gee,
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
pretty
clearly
was
not
aimed--
justice
antonin
scalia
--at
defeating
federal
actions.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
an
important
factor,
i
would
think.
let
me
ask
another
question.
it
--
it's
a
standard
rule
of
international
law
that
no
state
will
enforce
the
penal
laws
of
another
state.
i
assume
the
federal
government
could
not
--
maybe
i'm
wrong
to
assume.
could
the
federal
government
require
new
york
to
prosecute
federal
crimes?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
either.
[laughter]
i
think
it
can't.
i
think
it
can't,
probably.
and
my
next
question
was
going
to
be:
why
aren't
punitive
damages
penal
laws
as
well?
and
if
that's
the
same
principle,
maybe
there's
no
big
deal
about
new
york
excluding
penal
damages--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
it
hard
to
regard
this
as
a
non-neutral
law
when
it
was
put
on
the
books
before
there
were
any
of
these
1983
actions.
