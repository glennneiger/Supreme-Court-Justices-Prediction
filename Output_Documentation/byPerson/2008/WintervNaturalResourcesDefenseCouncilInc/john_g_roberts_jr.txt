chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
in
case
07-1239,
winter
v.
natural
resources
defense
council.
general
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
temporary
stay
pending
certiorari,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
what
justice
ginsburg
was
talking
about
--
and
she
can
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
--
were
the
modifications
from
the
initial
preliminary
injunction
and
the
modified
preliminary
injunction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let
me
follow
that.
you
concede
that
you
have
to
prepare
an
eis
in
light
of
the
ceq's
emergency
circumstances?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
didn't
you
--
i
mean,
you
emphasize
the
level
of
detail
and
comprehensiveness
of
the
environmental
assessment
that
the
navy
prepared.
why
didn't
you
just
make
--
why
didn't
you
just
go
ahead
and
do
an
eis
from
the
outset
if
you
were
going
to
engage
in
such
effort
with
respect
to
the
environmental
assessment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
why
--
i
don't
know
if
this
is
justice
souter's
question,
but
why
ceq?
i
mean,
nepa
doesn't
really
give
anybody
any
regulatory
authority
--
epa,
ceq.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
ceq
is
an
odd
entity
to
be
doing
this.
they're
more
or
less
an
office
in
the
white
house,
rather
than
a
free-standing
agency.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
an
environmental
assessment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kendall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
with
one
important
qualification.
the
question
was
the
balance
of
those
equities
on
a
preliminary
basis.
in
other
words,
before
we
reach
a
final
decision,
we're
going
to
prevent
the
navy
from
engaging
in
the
sonar
exercises
that
they
think
are
necessary.
not
even
after
we
have
decided
they
were
wrong,
just
because
we
think
there
is
a
likelihood
that
they
might
be
wrong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
that
would
have
been
the
whole
ball
game
until
i
read
your
brief.
your
brief
does
not
spend
a
page
defending
the
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
lower
courts.
nothing
about
emergency
circumstances
or
ceq.
instead,
you
raise
other
arguments
on
which
the
district
court
did
not
rely
in
finding
likelihood
of
success.
so
given
that,
i
would
have
thought
we
would
have
a
lot
more
to
talk
about
when
it
gets
to
the
permanent
injunction
on
the
merits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
yes,
yes.
you
certainly
raised
those
issues.
i'm
not
saying
that.
what
i
am
saying
the
district
court
didn't
rely
on
those
in
finding
likelihood
of
success.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
what
the
district
court
relied
on.
where
in
your
brief
do
i
see
a
defense
of
the
district
court's
analysis,
as
opposed
to
the
very
coherent
argument
about
hayburn's
case
and
everything
else,
issues
the
district
court
didn't
reach?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
have
increased
exponentially
the
area
that
the
navy
had
to
scrutinize
to
determine
if
there
were
marine
mammals
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
increase
--
you
keep
saying
it's
just
1,000
yards.
but
it's
1,000
yards
of
circle.
and
if
i
remember
high
school
geometry
right,
that's
a
squared
increase.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
there
are
people
in
airplanes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
just
straight
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
my
question
was,
that
increases
the
area
exponentially
that
has
to
be
scrutinized.
and
i
don't
see
why,
as
you
said,
that
was
wrong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
very
unfair.
there
were
six
conditions
imposed
by
the
district
court.
the
navy
didn't
even
appeal
four
of
them.
they
gave
up
on
four
out
of
the
six
issues.
that's
not
insisting
on
having
it
their
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
other
ways
it
struck
me
how
the
district
court
relied
on
the
fact
that
the
navy
had
taken
actions
to
protect
marine
mammals
in
the
past
to
say
well,
there
can't
be
any
problem
with
adding
more
protection.
no
good
deed
goes
unpunished.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
had
already
taken
actions
unilaterally
to
protect
marine
mammals.
now
you
say
that
wasn't
enough.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
were
taking
some
actions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
--
can
i
derail
you
a
little
bit
to
get
back
to
the
balance
of
equities
question?
as
i
read
the
opinions
most
of
the
balancing
here
was
done
by
the
ninth
circuit,
not
the
district
court.
i
found
the
district
court's
balancing
in
only
one
sentence.
the
court
after
all
of
its
prior
--
the
court
is
also
satisfied
that
the
balance
of
hardships
tips
in
favor
--
favor
of
granting
an
injunction.
"it
goes
on.
"
"but
it's
just
one
sentence.
"
"the
ninth
circuit
talked
about
deferring
to
the
district
court
but
in
fact
it
supplied
all
of
the
analysis
for
the
balance.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
suppose
it's
still
fair
to
say
that
on
all
of
those
it
focused
most
of
its
attention
on
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits
and
irreparable
harm
rather
than
a
balancing
of
the
equities.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
quite
right.
my
question,
though,
is
that
at
no
point
that
did
the
district
judge
undertake
a
balancing
of
the
equities,
putting
on
the
one
side
the
potential
for
harm
to
marine
mammals
that
she
found
--
and
that's
your
point
about
the
record
--
and
putting
on
the
other
side
the
potential
that
a
north
korean
diesel
electric
submarine
will
get
within
range
of
pearl
harbor
undetected.
now,
i
think
that's
a
pretty
clear
balance.
and
the
district
court
never
entered
--
never
went
into
that
analysis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
the
district
--
even
the
district
court
recognized,
in
the
words
of
her
opinion,
that
it
would
propose
"a
substantial
challenge"
--
that's
a
quote
--
for
the
navy
to
shift
the
regime
that
she
imposed
in
the
injunction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kendall,
you
wanted
to
respond
to
some
comments
by
the
solicitor
general.
i
wanted
to
make
sure
that
you've
had
an
opportunity
to
do
that.
i
--
you
were
derailed
by
questioning,
but
i
know
you
responded
to
some.
are
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
garre,
have
you
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
07-1239
donald
winter,
secretary
of
the
navy
versus
natural
resources
defense
council.
the
united
states
navy
conducts
training
exercise
and
exercises
in
the
waters
off
the
coast
of
southern
california.
in
these
exercises,
ships,
submarines
and
aircraft
trained
together
as
members
of
a
strike
group.
one
of
the
greatest
threats
a
strike
group
must
be
prepared
to
meet
is
that
post
by
modern
diesel-electric
submarines.
these
submarines
are
extremely
difficult
to
detect
and
track
because
they
can
operate
almost
silently.
potential
adversaries
of
the
united
states
have
about
300
of
these
submarines.
the
most
effective
tool
for
identifying
and
tracking
submerged
diesel-electric
submarines
is
active
sonar.
active
sonar
emits
pulses
of
sound
underwater
and
then
receives
back
echoes
of
acoustic
waves
from
a
target.
due
to
the
importance
of
antisubmarine
warfare,
a
strike
group
may
not
be
certified
for
deployment
until
it
demonstrates
proficiency
in
the
use
of
active
sonar
to
detect,
track
and
neutralize
enemy
submarines.
the
waters
off
the
coast
of
southern
california
also
contain
at
least
37
species
of
marine
mammals.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
groups
and
individuals
devoted
to
protecting
these
animals
which
they
assert
can
be
seriously
injured
by
active
sonar.
the
navy
disputes
that
claim
pointing
out
that
it
has
conducted
active
sonar
training
in
the
area
for
40
years
without
a
single
documented
sonar
related
injury
to
any
marine
mammal.
the
plaintiff
sue
the
navy
claiming
that
the
training
exercises
violated
federal
law
and
that
in
particular,
the
navy
should
have
prepared
an
environmental
impact
statement
before
embarking
on
the
latest
round
of
exercises.
the
plaintiffs
asked
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
they
wanted
the
district
court
to
order
the
navy
to
stop
using
sonar
right
away
while
the
case
went
forward.
now,
when
a
court
receives
such
request,
it
considers
which
side
will
probably
win,
how
the
respective
parties
will
be
harmed
if
an
injunction
is
granted
or
denied
and
how
the
public
interest
will
be
affected
by
the
court's
decision.
here,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
plaintiffs
were
probably
right
that
they
should
have
prepared
an
environmental
impact
statement.
the
court
then
weighed
the
respective
harms
into
the
public
interest.
it
first
ruled
that
the
navy
could
not
use
sonar
at
all,
but
later
said
it
could
do
so
if
it
complied
with
six
restrictions
designed
to
protect
marine
mammals.
the
navy
appealed
and
challenged
only
two
of
these
restrictions,
a
requirement
that
it
shut
down
active
sonar
if
a
marine
mammal
is
spotted
within
2200
yards,
other
vessel
and
the
requirement
that
it
lower
the
power
of
its
sonar
during
conditions
known
as
surface
ducting.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
appealed
these
restrictions
then
we
granted
the
navy's
request
for
further
review.
now
as
noted,
the
lower
courts
concluded
that
the
plaintiffs
were
probably
right
that
the
navy
should
have
prepared
an
environmental
impact
statement.
we
do
not
find
it
necessary
to
review
that
conclusion.
even
if
it
is
correct,
the
district
court
should
not
have
entered
the
injunction
it
did
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
appealed
that
injunction.
the
record
in
this
case
contains
declarations
from
some
of
the
navy's
most
senior
officers,
all
of
whom
underscored
the
threat
posed
by
enemy
submarines
and
the
need
for
extensive
sonar
training
to
counter
this
threat.
those
officers
emphasized
that
realistic
training
cannot
be
accomplished
under
the
two
challenged
restrictions
imposed
by
the
district
court,
the
2200
yard
shut
down
zone
and
the
power
zone
requirement
--
the
power
down
requirement
during
surface
ducting
conditions.
the
lower
courts
had
no
basis
for
second
guessing
those
judgments.
for
example,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
2200
yards
shut
down
zone
would
not
be
overly
burdensome
because
marine
mammal
sightings
during
training
exercises
are
relatively
rare.
but
the
injunction
will
increase
the
surface
area
of
the
navy's
voluntary
shutdown
zone
by
a
factor
of
over
100.
and
as
the
navy
explained
training
scenarios,
the
cat
and
mouse
game
of
finding
and
tracking
the
submarines
can
take
several
days
to
develop.
so
each
additional
shutdown
can
result
in
the
loss
of
several
days
worth
of
training.
the
other
restriction
imposed
below
involved
ocean
conditions
known
as
surface
ducting.
now
when
surface
ducting
occurs,
active
sonar
becomes
more
useful
near
the
surface
but
less
effective
at
greater
depths.
diesel-electric
submariners
are
trained
to
take
advantage
of
these
distortions
to
avoid
being
detected
by
sonar.
the
lower
courts
concluded
that
requiring
the
navy
to
power
down
its
sonar
during
such
conditions
was
reasonable
because
surface
ducting
occurs
relatively
rarely.
this
reasoning
is
backwards.
as
the
navy
explained,
it
is
precisely
because
surface
ducting
is
both
rare
and
unpredictable
and
because
enemy
submarines
can
take
advantage
of
it
that
the
navy
must
be
able
to
train
under
these
conditions
when
they
do
occur.
now,
we
did
not
discount
the
importance
of
the
ecological,
scientific,
and
recreational
interest
legitimately
before
the
court
on
the
other
side
of
the
scale.
military
judgments
and
interests
do
not
always
trump
other
considerations
and
the
court
has
not
held
that
they
do.
but
the
public
interest
in
ensuring
that
the
navy
is
prepared
to
counter
the
serious
risks
to
national
security
post
by
modern
diesel-electric
submarines
in
the
hands
of
potential
adversaries
clearly
outweighs
the
interests
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
the
court
does
not
regard
that
question
as
closed.
the
navy
previously
took
voluntary
measures
to
address
concerns
about
marine
mammals
and
chose
not
to
challenge
four
other
restrictions
imposed
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
but
the
navy
has
explained
that
the
two
remaining
restrictions
post
a
threat
to
its
ability
to
prepare
for
war.
the
court
of
appeals
noted
that
the
navy
could
return
to
the
district
court
to
seek
modification
of
the
preliminary
injunction
if
it
actually
resulted
in
an
inability
to
train.
but
the
navy
is
not
required
to
wait
until
it
is
unable
to
train
sufficient
forces
for
national
defense
before
seeking
dissolution
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
by
then,
it
may
be
too
late.
now,
if
the
navy
is
required
by
law
to
prepare
an
environmental
impact
statement,
the
question
we
do
not
decide,
there
are
other
means
available
to
implement
that
requirement
short
of
stopping
the
navy's
training
in
a
matter
it
considers
vital
to
national
defense.
these
means
include
declaratory
relief
or
an
injunction
directed
to
the
preparation
of
an
environmental
impact
statement
rather
than
to
the
navy's
use
of
sonar
in
the
meantime.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
injunction
is
vacated
in
part
to
the
extent
challenge
by
the
navy.
justice
breyer
has
filed

opinion
concurring
in
