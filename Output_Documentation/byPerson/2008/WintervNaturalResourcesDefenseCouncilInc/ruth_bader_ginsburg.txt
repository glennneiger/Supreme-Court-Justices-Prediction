justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
garre,
when
you
address
the
injunction,
do
you
mean
the
injunction
as
originally
ordered
by
the
district
court
or
are
you
taking
account
of
the
modification
made
by
the
ninth
circuit,
and
would
you
say
that
the
three
points
you
just
made
would
apply
as
well
to
the
injunction
as
modified?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
didn't
mention
the
564
exposures
that
were
typed
level
a
in
the
environmental
assessment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
564
number
was
level
a,
which
i
also
thought
meant
exposure
resulting
in
severe
harm.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
rulemaking
to
do
what?
to
set
up
an
orderly
regime
for
federal
agencies
to
carry
out
their
obligations
under
nepa?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
good
is
it
if,
as
i
understand
it,
the
whole
training
program
will
be
over
in
december,
and
then
the
environmental
impact
statement,
which
was
supposed
to
come
first,
is
going
to
come
after
the
whole
project
is
concluded?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
near
--
"near
certainty".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
you
were
not
suggesting--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
you
are
not
suggesting
that
--
that
there
is
a
probability
of
success
on
the
claim
that
you
had
to
file
an
environmental
impact
statement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
i
thought
you
conceded
that
point.
