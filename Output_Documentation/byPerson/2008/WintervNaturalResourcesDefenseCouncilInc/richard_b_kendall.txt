mr.
richard
b.
kendall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case
is
a
very
traditional
question
of
equity
jurisprudence.
the
fundamental
question
is
whether
the
district
court's
factual
finding
that
the
injunction
will
permit
the
navy
to
train
and
certify
its
sailors
is
supported
by
the
evidence.
because
if
it
is
supported
by
the
evidence
it
cannot
be
clearly
erroneous.
and
if
it
is
not
clearly
erroneous,
it
cannot
be
reversed.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
justice
alito,
i
submit
not,
and
here
is
why.
this
was
an
issue
of
fact.
the
question
was
whether,
in
light
of
the
navy's
past
training,
which
was
abundantly
shown
in
the
record,
their
post-complaint,
during
the
litigation,
lawyercrafted
declarations
were
sufficiently
persuasive
to
undo
all
that
evidence
that
showed
that
the
navy
had
repeatedly
used
safety
zones.
now,
what
happened
here
was
that
the
judge
was
extraordinarily
deferential
to
the
navy.
the
judge
rejected
most
of
the
measures
that
plaintiffs
sought,
crediting
where
the
evidence
was
not
to
the
contrary
the
declarations
of
the
navy
saying,
for
example,
we
need
to
train
at
night.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
justice
breyer,
the
response
in
the
record
appears
in
the
after-action
reports
of
the
eight
prior
exercises
in
southern
california.
there
were
four
from
the
series
that
we
challenge
and
four
after-action
reports,
prepared
earlier
ones.
and
you
will
find
those
in
the
joint
appendix
at
326
to
45.
what
the
court
found
was
that
the
navy
had
trained
and
certified
its
troops
during
those
eight
socal
exercises
despite
the
complete
absence
of
surface
ducting
conditions.
and
it
was
conceded--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--because
surface
ducting
conditions
are,
as
it
happens,
quite
rare.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
right.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
well,
the
question
before
the
court
was
balancing
the
requirement
that
the
navy
comply
with
the
law
and
the
environmental
harms
against
the
navy's
interest.
and
our
point--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--that's
quite
right.
and
of
course,
in
this
litigation
that
was
the
whole
ball
game,
because
by
the
time
you
had
reached
trial
in
this
case
all
of
the
exercises--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--i
respectfully
disagree.
we
took
the
position
from
the
beginning--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--well,
i
also
disagree
on
that
point.
you
will
find
at
page
97a
of
the
appendix
that
was
submitted
with
the
petition
for
certiorari
the
court's
declaration
that
there
was
no
emergency.
you
will
find--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--but
that's
the
question.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
the
district
court
did
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
navy
could
train.
that
negated
any
emergency
under
any
definition
of
the
term.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
--
and
there
was
debate
about
this
below
--
an
emergency
can
be
foreseeable
and
expected,
as
justice
souter
was
--
his
questions
were
probing,
or
whether
the
emergency
can
be
--
must
be
unexpected.
there
was
debate
about
that
below.
but
the
position
that
we
took
and
the
position
that
the
district
court
took
was
there
is
no
emergency.
the
reason
there
is
no
emergency
is
because
the
navy
--
the
navy
is
perfectly
able
to
train
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
there
was
also
prior
exercise
in
hawaii.
you
will
recall
from
the
brief
that
we
had
a
prior
litigation
that
resulted
in
the
consent
decree
in
hawaii.
in
that
consent
decree
the
navy
agreed
to
train
with
a
surface
ducting
powerdown.
so,
they
had
previously
told
the
same
judge
that
they
were
capable
of
training
in
surface
ducting
conditions
with
that
powerdown,
else
they
would
not
have
agreed
to
that
decree.
there
was
evidence
in
the
record.
the
problem
that
the
judge
had
is
that
the
navy
cannot
be
judge
of
its
own
cause.
deference
does
have
its
limits.
and
this
judge
was
in
a
position
of
reviewing
facts
of
prior
exercises
and
what
the
navy--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--if
i
may
proceed
then
to
the
safety
zone
specifics,
because
that's
the
other
issue.
remember
there
were
a
number
of
injunctive
measures
that
the
navy
objected
to
in
the
district
court
that
they
no
longer
object
to.
they
ceased
to
object
to
them
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
haven't
brought
them
up
here.
so
the
next
issue
is
the
2200-yard
safety
zone.
now,
first,
why
was
the
safety
zone
chosen?
it
was
chosen
because
that
is
the
navy's
preferred
method
of
mitigation.
they
have
always
mitigated
using
safety
zones.
they
have
preferred
to
mitigate
using
a
safety
zone
that
is
1,000
yards.
we
asked
for
one
that
was
2,200
yards.
the
question
was,
what
is
the
difference
in
training
capability
in
the
two
zones?
so
we
looked
at
that.
and
where
did
we
look?
we
looked
at
the
statistics
from
the
after-action
reports.
now,
in
this
case
we
had
helpful
information
to
use,
because
the
after-action
reports
reveal
that
the
effect
of
widening
the
safety
zone
would
have
been
at
most
one
more
shutdown
or
powerdown
each
exercise.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
incorrect.
it
would--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--but
think
about
how
this
is
being
done.
the
way
it's
being
done
is
that
you
have
somebody
on
the
deck
with
binoculars
and
they
are
looking
straight
ahead
and
they
can
either
look
out
1,000
yards
or
out
2,000
yards.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
there
are
people
in
airplanes
and
they
are
looking
down
and
they
can
see
as
much
as
they
can
see
within
that
area.
and
if
they
see
a
marine
mammal,
there
will
be
a
shutdown
or
a
powerdown;
and
if
they
don't
see
it,
there
won't
be
one.
you
can
only
shut
down
or
power
down
when
you
see
one.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
because
they
argued
--
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
you
were
referring
to
their
argument
--
which
is
not
that
the
area
was
exponentially
larger
and
that
creates
difficulties
of
observation;
they
argued
it
would
create
an
exponentially
greater
number
of
shutdowns.
and
that
is
mathematically
proven
false
by
the
after-action
reports,
because
it's
one
per
exercise.
and
this
judge,
keep
in
mind,
had
been
listening
to
the
navy
make
factual
assertions
from
the
very
beginning.
and
the
factual
assertions
that
the
navy
made
at
the
start
of
this
case
about
the
nature
of
the
environmental
harms
were
completely
disproven
by
the
ea
and
by
the
expert
evidence
that
was
brought
to
bear.
and
there
are
a
number
of
statements
that
general
garre
may
that
i
think
i
should
address.
one
of
them
in
answer
to
questions
from
justice
ginsburg
had
to
do
with
the
level
a
takes
on
beaked
whales.
the
navy
tries
to
dismiss
those
by
saying
we
only
graded
the
effects
on
beaked
whales
as
level
a
because
we
did
that
as
a
matter
of
generous
policy.
they
didn't
do
it
for
policy
reasons.
they
did
it
because
that's
what
the
science
compels,
because
beaked
whales
have
stranded
repeatedly
around
the
world
correlated
--
caused
by
in
the
views
of
scientists,
and
the
evidence
is
overwhelming,
by
sonar.
and
the
reason
that
happens
especially
to
beaked
whales
is
because
they
dive
for
very
long
periods
of
time.
and
when
they
dive
for
very
long
periods
of
time,
and
they
are
then
bombarded
with
sonar,
which
by
the
way
in
sound
intensity,
in
this
courtroom
if
we
had
a
jet
engine
and
you
multiplied
that
noise
by
2,000
times,
correcting
for
water,
that's
the
sound's
intensity
that
would
be
going
on
in
the
water
if
you
were
a
marine
mammal
near
that
source.
the
beaked
whales,
the
scientists
believe,
adjust
their
diving
patterns;
since
they
dive
down
for
so
long,
if
they
come
up
too
fast,
they
get
the
bends
so
there
is
evidence
of
--
when
they
do
the
necropsies
of
these
beaked
whales,
they
find
hemorrhaging,
the
embolisms
in
various
parts
of
the
bloodstream
and
many,
many
deaths.
so
there
is
enormous
scientific
evidence
that
there
is
a
greater
harm
to
beaked
whales
that
is
caused
by
sonar
and
that
is
precisely
why
the
navy
was
compelled
in
the
ea
to
recognize
that
evidence.
now,
one
thing
that
was
said
here
which
i
found--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--the
evidence
of
the
prediction
of
the
level
a
takes,
in
the--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--it
is
in
the
--
there
is
a
table
on
page
223
of
volume
1
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
then
there
are
the
discussions
of
beaked
whale
injuries
that
general
garre
referred
to,
and
what
they
show
is
that
beaked
whales
will
experience
the
effects
i
described.
but
there
is
also
expert
evidence
in
the
record
in
the
form
of
a
number
of
declarations
by
scientists
who
have
studied
beaked
whales
for
--
for
quite
some
time.
the
evidence
you
can
find,
and
it's
referred
to
on
page
4
of
our
brief.
joint
appendix
600-602,
673-89,
738-41,
760,
the
supplemental
excerpt
of

at

also

685.
and
there
are
a
few
other
references
on
page
4
of
our
brief.
i
also
wanted
to
talk
about
the
behavioral
changes,
because
it's--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--the
important
thing
here
is
that
the
navy
is
focused
on
having
it
its
way
or
no
way.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
no
--
i
agree,
although
the
reason
i
believe
that
they
conceded
those
is
that
the
record
was
--
was
so
overwhelming
on
each
of
those
points,
they
hadn't
even
put
in
evidence
to
suggest
that
those
measures
would
cause
them
any
problem.
they
simply
didn't
have
the
declaration,
and
even
the--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--well,
if
i
can
--
if
i
can
answer
that
this
way.
we
negotiated
with
the
navy
for
months
and
months
and
months,
the
brinpack
case,
i
settled
with
them.
we
tried
very
hard
to
resolve
this
case,
but
keep
in
mind
that
the
navy
until
the
district
court
ruled
refused
to
agree
to
any
measures
that
we
proposed
--
any
measures.
so
it
was
a
binary--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--right.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
that's
right.
and
--
and
so
we
had
a
litigation
that
was
focused
on
were
there
additional
actions
that
should
be
taken;
and
there
is
extensive
evidence
taken
and
extensive
argument
and
then
the
district
court
ruled.
and
the
correct
path,
if
the
navy
was
aggrieved
by
that
decision,
was
a
higher
court.
but
instead,
in
order
to
avoid
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
--
and
remember,
that
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
as
this
court
said
in
the
anderson
v.
bessemer
city
case,
says
when
there
are
two
permissible
views
of
the
evidence,
the
factfinder's
choice
between
them
cannot
be
clearly
erroneous.
so
in
order
to
evade
that,
and
this
is
typical
of
the
tactics
that
we
experienced
and
the
uncompromising
nature
of
their
approach
that
we
experienced,
they
went
to
ceq
to
try
to
trump
the
entire
injunctive
process.
now
that
they
did
without
any
authority
in
nepa--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--you
know,
the
whole
point
of
the
armed
forces,
i
think
is
to--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--i
think
the
point
of
the
armed
forces
is
to
safeguard
our
freedoms
causing
the
least
damage
possible
to
our
environment.
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
repeatedly.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
no.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
they
don't.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
we
have
never,
ever
contended
that
any
of
our
proposed
restrictions
should
apply
to
combat
at
all,
and
it
doesn't.
this
training
was
planned
for
a
very
long
time.
had
--
there
were
questions
earlier,
justice
scalia
i
think
raised
a
question
is
the
ea
as
good
as
the
eis?
there
is
a
big,
big
difference.
there
are
really
two,
between
an
ea
and
eis.
the
substantive
difference
is
that
an
ea
doesn't
have
the
same
alternatives
analysis
that
an
eis
has,
and
the
procedural
difference,
which
in
a
country
that
values
transparency
and
ideas
and
exchange
with
the
public,
is
the
notice
and
comment
that
eis
requires.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
that--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--that
focus
is
not
an
element
of
our
case.
i
was
simply
responding
to
justice
breyer's
question
as,
i
admit,
a
somewhat
frustrated
lawyer
who
tried
to
work
things
out
as
to
how
it
happened
that
they
weren't
worked
out.
i
do
want
to
speak
a
bit
about
some
of
the
comments
that
general
garre
made
in
response
to
justice
kennedy
and
justice
scalia's
questions
about--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--well,
i
--
with
respect
i
think
the
district
court
spoke
in
several
different
opinions.
so
you
can
--
you
can
find
out
what
the
district
court
was
thinking
by
looking
not
only
at
the
injunction,
but
also
at
the
--
at
the
responsible
district
court
denying
the
motion
to
vacate.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
well
i
would
disagree
in
one
respect,
which
is
the
court
was
very
focused
on
which
measures
to
impose
and
which
measures
not
to
impose.
there
were,
you
know,
at
least
10
pages
of
her
injunctive
opinion
going
through
that,
and
each
--
and
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
vacate
did
the
same
thing,
because
--
after
the
ninth
circuit
ordered
judge
cooper
to
issue
a
tailored
injunction,
each
side
briefed
very
extensively,
with
a
huge
amount
of
supporting
evidence,
the
issue
of
which
measures
should
be
imposed.
and
judge
cooper
decided
that
certain
measures
would
not
be
imposed
and
certain
ones
would,
and
she
explained
why.
and
she
did
that
against
the
background
of
the
harms
that
were
designed
to
be
prevented.
and
so
what
i
would
submit
is--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--there's
a
good
reason
why
she
didn't
balance
that.
and
that
gets
back
to
my
opening
remarks,
which
is
that
the
premise
of
that
question
and
why,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
would
be
concerned
about
that
is
that
there
would
be
an
exposure
to
that
submarine,
that
north
korean
submarine.
but
the
judge
had
made
a
factual
finding,
and
the
factual
finding
she
made
was
that
training
would
not
be
affected.
so,
on
the
one
hand,
you
have
a
factual
finding
that
there
is
no
harm
to
the
training
at
all,
which
means
that
in
the
balance
the
harms
to
the
environment
are
much
heavier.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
no.
judge
cooper,
like
all
judges,
has
to
sift
through
the
evidence
of
experts,
and
judge
cooper
gave
great
weight
to
the
navy
on
everything
that
the
navy
said.
but
there
was
a
place
where
she
had
to
stop
because,
after
all,
she's
a
judge,
and
where
she
had
to
stop
was
where
the
evidence
belied
the
declarations.
and,
you
know,
this
court
has
had
in
a
number
of
decisions
to
confront
the
question
of
whether
wartime
exigencies
forced
the
courts
to
suspend
their
powers
of
judgment.
i
submit
that
what
happened
here
is
that
this
court
didn't,
and
that's
what--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--that's
right,
and
it
will
in
fact
pose
a
challenge
and
the
proof
is
then
in
the
pudding,
which
is
that
the
navy
has
now
conducted
13
out
of
14
exercises,
the
last
8
of
which
had
been
conducted
under
this
regime
as
modified
by
the
circuit.
and
they
have
not,
as
they
were
invited,
had
to
come
back
and
ask
for
relief
despite
the
fact
that
they
had
the
opportunity.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
yes.
first,
responding
to
that
very
point,
it's
common
ground
among
the
litigants
and
certainly
with
the
court
that
the
interests
ascribed
by
the
president
and
by
every
other
government
official
with
respect
to
naval
training
are
of
the
highest
importance.
the
question
was
--
and
this
is
the
court's
factual
finding,
and
the
question
is
whether
there
was
sufficient
record
evidence
to
support
it,
whether
she
was
right
that
there
wouldn't
be
an
adverse
effect
except
for
possibly
some
logistical
changes,
but
no
adverse
effect
in
the
conduct
and
achievement
of
the
training.
if
there's
no
adverse
effect,
then
what
the
president
is
speaking
to
is
speaking
past
what's
concerning
the
court.
now,
with
respect
to
irreparable
harm,
the
argument
that
general
garre
made
i
think
mistakenly
collapses
the
normal
equity
issue
in
this
following
sense:
once
a
plaintiff
satisfies
article
iii,
very
important,
and
under
the
japan
whaling
case,
the
lujan
v.
national
wildlife
case,
there
is
no
question
that
these
plaintiffs
deserve
to
be
in
court,
and
it
has
never
been
contested.
then
you
move
to
the
traditional
equity
standard
for
assessing
irreparable
harm,
hecht
v.
bowles,
but
in
the
environmental
area
we
have
a
decision,
the
amoco
v.
gambell
decision.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
it
always
does,
and
the
question
is
just
somewhat
different.
and
i
think,
justice
scalia,
if
you
look
at
your
opinion
in
the
second
lujan
case
and
you
think
about
the
imminence
requirement
of
standing
there,
what
irreparable
harm
adds
to
that
is
the
traditional
need
to
show
that
the
harm
you
suffer
cannot
be
quantified
in
damages
or
it's
difficult
to
quantify,
and
that
a
remedy
at
law
will
not
achieve
the
adjustment
between
the
parties
that's
required.
that's
what
equity
does.
equity
preserves
the
positions
of
the
parties.
and
as
this
court
said
in
amoco,
environmental
injury,
by
it's
very
nature,
can
seldom
be
adequately
remedied
by
money
damages
and
is
often
permanent
or
at
least
of
long-lasting
duration,
i.e.,
irreparable;
that
is
amoco
at
page
545.
if
such
injury
is
sufficiently
likely,
therefore,
the
court
said,
the
balance
of
harms
will
usually
favor
the
issuance
of
an
injunction.
now,
there's
one
other
point
which
was
briefly
touched
on
here.
justice
kennedy
was
asking
what
the
circuits
have
said.
now,
the
circuits
have
said
different
things
about
irreparable
harm.
the
leading
edge
of
discussion
in
the
circuits
began
with
then-judge
breyer
on
the
first
circuit
in
the
massachusetts
v.
watt
and
sierra
club
v.
marsh
cases,
where
he
pointed
out
that
nepa
itself
has,
while
it's
a
procedural
statute,
a
substantive
purpose,
the
substantive
purpose
being
informed
decisionmaking.
and
if
there
is
not
informed
decisionmaking
before
there
is
an
agency
committed
to
action,
a
harm
has
occurred.
that's
the
harm
that--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--can
i--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--i
was
only
responding
to
justice
kennedy's
question
as
to
what
the
circuits
have
said.
that's
the
leading
edge
of
what
the
circuits
have
said.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
that's
very
kind.
i
think
there's
just
one
other
point
perhaps
i
should
make,
which
is
there
was
some
discussion
of
whether
nepa
actually
authorizes
ceq
to
conduct
this
kind
of
examination
of
a
district
court's
ruling.
i
submit
that
there
is
nothing
anywhere
in
nepa
and
certainly
not
in
the
"fullest
extent
possible"
language
which
gives
that
authority.
this
court
has
already
decided
that
point
in
the
flint
ridge
case,
where
it
said
that
nepa
does
not
give
way
unless
there
is
an
irreconcilable
conflict
between
nepa
and
another
statute.
they
have
pointed
to
no
such
thing.
