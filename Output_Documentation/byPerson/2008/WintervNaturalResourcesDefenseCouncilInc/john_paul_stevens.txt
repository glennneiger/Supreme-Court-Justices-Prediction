just
as
to
dolphins?
justice
john
paul

and
what
percentage
is
that
of
the
total
population
in
the
area?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
solicitor
general.
is
it
understood,
though,
that
there
is
a
duty
to
prepare
an
environmental
impact
statement?
justice
john
paul

mr.
garre,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
this
were
not
a
navy
case
with
all
of
the
implications
of
the
navy,
but
an
ordinary
case
in
which
it
was
demonstrated
that
an
eis
had
to
be
filed,
would
it
not
be
normal
--
normal
action
to
enjoin
the
--
the
government
action
until
the
eis
was
filed?
because
the
--
the
very
fact
that
you
need
an
eis
is
--
is
because
you
don't
know
what
environmental
consequences
may
ensue.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
eis.
so
isn't
it
the
normal
practice
to
enjoin
government
action
until
the
eis
is
filed
when
it
is
clear
there
is
a
duty
to
file?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
whole
theory
of
the
--
of
the
environmental
impact
statement
is
that
we
don't
really
know
what
the
harm
will
be.
so
how
can
you
say
that
in
order
to
get
an
injunction
against
the
government
action
you
have
to
prove
irreparable
harm?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
really
arguing
that
an
--
that
a
temporary
statement
is
enough,
will
always
be
enough.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
a
finding
that
it
is
necessary,
and
here
we
have
that
finding
as
i
understand
it.
