justice
david
h.
souter
where
was
the
statutory
authority
suspending
the
obligation
to
provide
an
eis?
you
mentioned
a
regulation.
where
in
the
statute
does
it
say
that
the
council
on
environmental
quality
can
dispense
with
this
requirement?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's
not
the
question
i
am
asking.
i
am
not
asking
about
the
consequences
of
not
complying.
i
am
asking
what
is
the
statutory
authority
for
the
council
on
environmental
quality
to
dispense
with
the
statutory
obligation
to
prepare
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
--
as
i
understand
it,
that's
what
you're
arguing
in
effect,
as
an
intervening
--
as
of
intervening
legal
significance.
and
i
want
to
know
what
the
statutory
authority
is
for
that.
i
don't
see
it
in
nepa.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
as
a
general
proposition
that's
fine,
but
what's
the
statutory
authority
for
them
to
engage
in
rulemaking
authority
that
dispenses
with
the
government's
obligation
to
comply
with
an
eis
requirement?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
--
i
mean,
the
claim
is
that
you
weren't
complying
with
it
at
the
time
the
request
for
an
injunction
was
brought,
and
everything
else
is
consequent
on
that.
so
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
point,
in
effect,
at
which
the
claim
was
made
that
the
government
is
not
complying.
one
of
your
answers
to
that
is
right
now,
as
a
result
of
subsequent
council
on
environmental
quality
action,
we're
not
in
the
same
situation
that
we
were
in
when
the
suit
was
brought.
and
i
want
to
know
what
the
statutory
authority
is
for
the
council
on
environmental
quality
to
take
the
action
with
the
effect
that
you
claim
it
has.
justice
david
h.
souter
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--seems
to
cut
against
you.
i
am
not
getting
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--let
me
--
let
me
switch
back.
chief?
let
me
switch
back
in
time
for
a
second
to
the
beginning
of
these
exercises.
one
of
the
--
i
mean,
one
of
the
arguments,
and
you
have
alluded
to
it,
for
i
guess
the
appropriateness
of
the
council
on
environmental
quality's
action,
if
it
has
any
power
to
act,
is
emergency
circumstances.
my
understanding,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
on
the
facts,
is
that
the
exercises
began
in
february
of
2007.
my
understanding
is
that
it
was
in
that
same
month
of
february
2007
that
the
navy
produced
the
ea,
the
environmental
assessment,
so
that
in
effect,
as
i
understand
it,
the
navy
disclosed
the
fact
that
it
would
not
provide
an
eis
at
just
about
the
same
moment
that
it
began
the
exercises.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
guess
my
question
is,
to
the
extent
that
there
was
an
emergency,
wasn't
the
emergency
created
by
the
failure
of
the
navy
to
take
any
timely
action?
i
am
assuming
in
my
question
that
the
navy
had
decided
before
february
1st,
2007,
that
it
was
going
to
have
these
exercises.
so
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
that,
if
there
is
an
emergency,
it's
one
that
the
navy
created
simply
by
failing
to
start
an
eis
preparation
in
a
timely
way
at
which
it
tried
in
effect
to
sort
of
neutralize
by
keeping
everybody
in
the
dark
until
the
last
moment.
so,
why
--
why
shouldn't
we
say
that
--
even
assuming
the
council
on
environmental
quality
can
somehow
dispense
with
the
statute,
why
shouldn't
we
say
that
there
was
no
emergency
here
except
one
which
was
created
by
the
navy's
apparently
deliberate
inattention?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
was
a
gap
of
less
than
month,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
how
long
does
it
--
how
long
does
it
take
--
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
how
long
does
it
take
to
prepare
an
environmental
impact
statement?
it
takes
more
than--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
takes
more
than
a
month,
doesn't
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
navy
knew
more
than
the
1st
--
earlier
than
the
1st
of
february
that
it
was
going
to
engage
in
these
exercises,
didn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
they
wouldn't
have
been
in
the
situation
in
january
of
2008
if
they
hadn't
been
in
the
situation
i
described
in
february
of
2007.
and
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
the
navy
played
its
cards
very
close
to
its
vest--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
2007.
justice
david
h.
souter
didn't
both
the
circuit
and
the
district
court,
although
they
mentioned
that,
in
fact
find
that
it
was
--
i
forget
what
their
phrase
was
--
beyond
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
"near
certainty".
justice
david
h.
souter
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
harm.
i
mean,
the
standard
may
or
may
not
be
bright,
but
there
is
no
harm
to
the
navy
in
this
case
from
--
from
the
use
of
that
standard,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
--
we
may,
but
so
far
as
the
case
is
concerned
we
may
--
and
we
frequently
do
--
say
there
--
there
--
that
certainly
there's
no
harm
in
this
case,
the
error
was
harmless.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
--
in
effect,
you
are
saying
the
ea
is
the
equivalent
to
an
eis.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
difference
between
them?
i
--
i
assume
the
difference
is
the
eis
is
a
more
comprehensive
survey
and
--
and
set
of
conclusions.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
without
the
eis,
the
navy
is
acting
in
--
in
a
state
of
--
of
some
degree
of
ignorance
greater
than
would
be
the
case
if
--
if
it
had
done
--
done
the
eis.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that,
i
presume,
is
the
harm
that
the
--
that
the
statute
is
intended
to
prevent.
