justice
antonin
scalia
say
it
again?
i'm
not
sure
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--look,
the
problem
you
face
--
and
maybe
you're
being
whipsawed
--
is
that
you
are
effectively
estopped
from
the
argument
that
no
eis
is
necessary
by
the
fact
that
you
have
agreed
to
these
alternative
arrangements.
but
you
should
not
be
estopped
from
arguing
that
at
the
time
the
ea
was
issued
that
was
not
a
good
faith
completion
of
all
the
navy's
responsibilities.
and
that's
the
argument
that
is
being
made
against
you
now.
it
assumes
that
the
ea
wasn't
enough.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
we
--
that
that
assumption
is
valid.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
yes,
you
do,
but
it
may
not
be
in
the
circuits.
our
cases
say
that
procedural
injury
alone
is
not
the
kind
of
injury
that
confers
standing;
that
there
has
to
be
some
concrete
harm.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
the
only
injury
that
--
that
follows
from
the
mere
failure
to
file
an--
eis
is
--
is
a
procedural
injury
that
affects
the
entire
population.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
ea
demonstrates
in
your
view
that
the
eis
would
--
would
very
likely
say
that
this
--
this
action
by
the
navy
is
okay.
and
since
that
is
the
case,
there
is
--
there
is
no
probability
of
irreparable
harm;
to
the
contrary,
there
is
the
probability
of
no
irreparable
harm
because
of
the
ea.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
all
--
in
all
of
these
cases
it
is
controverted,
or
in
most
of
them,
whether
an
eis
is
either
necessary
--
is
even
necessary.
so
if
the
mere
allegation
that
it
was
necessary
gives
rise
to
an
allegation
of
irreparable
harm,
you
are
going
to
get
a
preliminary
injunction
in
all
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
didn't
assert
that
they
are
--
that
they
are
the
same
thing
substantively.
my
--
my
only
question
is
whether
your
assertion
of
bad
faith
on
--
on
the
part
of
the
navy
holds
water
so
long
as
they
were
doing
an
ea.
if
--
you
do
an
ea
to
see
if
an
eis
is
necessary.
and
you
say
if
there's
no
--
if
there
is
no
significant
harm
to
the
environment,
you
don't
even
need
an
eis.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
how
they
started.
that's
step
one,
and
many
agencies
do
that.
they
are
authorized
to
do
that.
i
don't
know
why
you
have
to
attribute
bad
faith
to
the
navy
simply
because
it
began
with
an
ea.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
that
irreparable
harm
is
the
assessment
of
--
for
purposes
of
the
injunction
--
refers
to
the
same
harm
that
is
the
harm
which
is
the
basis
for
standing,
is
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
unfortunately
contrary
to
what
our
opinions
have
said,
which
was
quite
clearly
that
procedural
----
[laughter]
--procedural
injury
is
not
the
kind
of
injury
that
gives
rise
to
article
iii
standing.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
whole
country
can
complain
about
the
failure
to
issue
an
eis.
that
is
not
the
kind
of
injury
that
gives
standing.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
--
before
you
sit
down.
i
thought
i
recalled
something
in
your
briefing
dealing
with
the
beaching
--
your
friend
made
a
point
regarding
the
beaching
of
beaked
whales,
that
very
substantially
showed
that
they
were
caused
by
sonar.
you
had
something
in
your
briefs
about
beaching,
but
i
wasn't
sure
whether
it
was
beaked
whales
or
only
dolphins.
