justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
have
to
do
it.
given
all
your
work
so
far,
how
long
would
it
take?
you
had
several
months
already,
so
how
long?
when
could
you
do
it
by?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we're
talking
about
two
months.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
what
justice
kennedy
started
to
ask.
i
mean,
i
said
why
doesn't
this
thing
go
away
after
two
months.
i
mean,
you've
done
it
anyway,
and
justice
kennedy
said
because
you
want
a
holding
from
the
court
that
will
help
you
in
other
cases
because
you
think
what
the
court
below
did
here
was
wrong.
and
you
said
"three
reasons",
and
you
got
out
the
first
one,
and
i
would
like
to
hear
the
other
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
wouldn't
--
look,
you
have
an
eis
for
the
reason
that
the
agency
itself,
once
it
reads
it,
might
decide
to
do
something
else.
that's
the
whole
point
of
an
eis.
so
if
the
agency
goes
ahead
with
the
action
before
reading
the
eis,
it
becomes
committed
to
that
course
of
action,
and
the
chances
that
the
eis
will
lead
it
to
back
up
are
the
same
as
the
chances
that
any
big
agency
will
back
up
once
it's
committed
to
a
course,
namely
a
lot
lower.
and
that
i
always
thought
was
the
whole
harm
that
the
eis
is
there
to
stop.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
see
evidence
to
the
contrary
on
two
important
points.
the
first
was
that
the
navy
had
affidavits
which
says
--
they
say
--
i
read
them.
maybe
i
just
missed
the
contrary.
but
they
said
that:
you
are
requiring
us,
judge,
to
turn
the
sonar
down
to
six
decibels
or
up
to
six,
whatever,
whenever
we
had
to
run
into
a
situation
called
layering
of
different
temperature
levels.
and
we
tell
you,
as
naval
officers,
that
that's
just
where
submarines
like
to
hide.
and
we
also
tell
you
that
if
we
can't
train
people
to
do
that
they
will
miss
out
on
an
important
part
of
how
to
find
these
submarines.
i
saw
no
answer
to
that.
the
second
thing
they
said
was
that:
we're
willing
to
turn
off
the
sonar
if
there's
any
marine
mammal
that
comes
within
500
yards,
which
is
a
quarter
of
a
mile,
about.
but
you
insist
that
we
turn
off
the
sonar
when
any
animal
comes
within
a
mile
and
a
quarter.
and
that's
quite
a
big
distance
more.
a
lot
of
animals
come
in
there,
and
if
we
have
to
turn
off
the
sonar
all
those
times,
we
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
much
training
done.
now,
those
two
things
seem
to
be
quite
important.
and
i
just
might
have
missed,
which
i
might
have,
which
is
why
i'm
asking,
what
the
response
was
by
equivalent
experts
to
those
points.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
mean,
despite
the
complete
absence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
whole
point.
that's
why
i
thought
they
didn't
prove
anything.
fine,
they
went
on
some
exercises
and
they
didn't
run
into
these
layered
things.
so
obviously
they
couldn't
have
training.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
they
are
saying
is,
when
you
do
run
into
that
situation
you've
got
to
train
people
to
deal
with
it.
it
doesn't
prove
much
that
when
you
didn't
run
into
it
they
didn't
train
people
to
deal
with
it.
how
could
they
have?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
can't
--
look,
i
don't
know
anything
about
this.
i'm
not
a
naval
officer.
but
if
i
see
an
admiral
come
along
with
an
affidavit
that
says
--
on
its
face
it's
plausible
--
that
you've
got
to
train
people
when
there
are
these
layers,
all
right,
or
there
will
be
subs
hiding
there
with
all
kinds
of
terrible
weapons,
and
he
swears
that
under
oath.
and
i
see
on
the
other
side
a
district
judge
who
just
says,
you're
wrong,
i
then
have
to
look
to
see
what
the
basis
is,
because
i
know
that
district
judge
doesn't
know
about
it,
either.
so,
the
basis
so
far
i'm
thinking
on
this
one
is
zero.
that's
--
because
what
you
have
told
me
is
they
completed
some
exercise
where
they
didn't
find
any
layering.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
generalities.
you
see
--
of
course,
i
agree
with
you
as
a
generality.
what
i
am
missing
here
is
the
specifics,
because
i
am
nervous
about
it,
as
you
can
see.
and
what
i
am
nervous
about
is
that
there
just
wasn't
enough
on
the
other
side,
on
your
side.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
--
i
want
to
give
you
a
chance
to
say
what's
so
terrible
about
what
they're
doing.
i
will
express
a
little
frustration.
not
your
fault.
but
why
couldn't
you
work
this
thing
out?
i
mean,
they
are
willing
to
give
you
quite
a
lot
of
conditions,
and
you
say,
well,
we
have
got
to
have
more
conditions.
and
you
are
asking
us
who
know
nothing
about
whales
and
less
about
the
military
to
start
reading
all
these
documents
to
try
to
figure
out
who's
right
in
the
case
where
the
other
side
says
the
other
side
is
totally
unreasonable.
and
the
issue
at
law
seems
to
be
something
that
is
going
to
last
for
two
months.
so
--
so,
why?
what
is
so
--
what
is
the
important
thing
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
the
basic
thing
work?
because
to
a
layperson,
when
i
think
of
the
armed
forces
preparing
an
environmental
impact
statement,
i
think,
the
whole
point
of
the
armed
forces
is
to
hurt
the
environment.
i
mean
----
[laughter]
i
don't
under
--
i
don't
understand
how
it's
supposed
to
work.
of
course
they
are
going
to
do
something
that
is
harmful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see
the
point,
i
am
trying
to
give
you
a
--
overstating
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
go
on
a
bombing
mission,
do
they
have
to
prepare
an
environmental
impact
statement
first?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
why
you
backed
down
on
this.
[laughter]
