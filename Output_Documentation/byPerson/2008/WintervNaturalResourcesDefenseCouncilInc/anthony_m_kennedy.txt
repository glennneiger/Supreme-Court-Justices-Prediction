justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
that
you're
are
here
because
you
find
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i
take
it
of
the
district
court,
prejudicial
for
the
government
on
an
ongoing
basis;
and
what
are
the
principal
reasons
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
particular
errors?
the
standard
for
review
--
pardon
me.
the
standard
for
the
grant
or
denial
of
injunction?
what
are
the
principal
areas
you
want
to
present
to
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--would
the
irreparable
injury
have
to
--
and
this
just
repeats
justice
stevens's
question.
it
is
the
same
concern
i
have.
let's
assume
an
eis
is
required;
let's
assume
it
hasn't
been
prepared;
let's
assume
the
government
project
is
going
to
proceed.
you
still
have
to
show
irreparable
harm
before
you
can
get
the
injunction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
authority
for
that
in
the
--
are
the
circuits
unanimous
on
that
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then,
let's
--
let's
assume
standing.
let's
assume
standing.
let's
--
let's
assume
people
have
standing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
any
authorities
in
the
circuits
which
would
indicate
that
irreparable
injury
is
not
required
when
there's
standing,
when
an
eis
is
required,
when
an
eis
has
not
been
prepared,
and
when
the
government
is
ready
to
proceed?
there
is
always
irreparable
injury
before
you
can
get
an
injunction?
that's
what
all
the
circuits
say?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
by
the
time
this
case
got
back
to
the
court
--
the
district
court
a
second
time,
the
president
had
made
a
determination
that
this
was
in
the
paramount
interest
of
the
united
states.
the
defense
and
commerce
department
jointly
had
made
a
determination
that
this
is
necessary
for
the
national
defense.
and
it
seems
to
me,
even
if
those
determinations
don't
resolve
the
eis
statement,
they
certainly
must
be
given
great
weight
by
the
district
court
in
determining
whether
to
continue
the
injunction.
if
you
could
comment
on
that,
incorporate
it
also
in
what
you
were
going
to
say
about
mr.
garre's
argument
with
reference
to
the
standard.
