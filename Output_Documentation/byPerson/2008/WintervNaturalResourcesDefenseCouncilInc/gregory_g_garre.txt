mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ability
to
locate
and
track
an
enemy
submarine
through
the
use
of
mid-frequency
active
sonar
is
vitally
important
to
the
survival
of
our
naval
strike
groups
deployed
around
the
world
and
therefore
critical
to
the
nation's
own
security.
in
this
case
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
a
preliminary
injunction
that
places
serious
restrictions
on
the
navy's
use
of
mfa
sonar
in
training
exercises
that
in
the
judgment
of
the
president
and
his
top
naval
officers
are
in
the
paramount
interests
of
the
united
states.
that
injunction
is
fundamentally
flawed
for
three
principal
reasons.
first,
it
is
based
on
an
erroneous
assessment
of
the
likelihood
of
success
on
respondent's
nepa
claim.
second
it
is
based
on
an
erroneous
conception
of
the
showing
of
irreparable
injury
necessary
to
secure
what
this
court
has
aptly
called
"the
extraordinary
and
dramatic
remedy"
of
a
preliminary
injunction.
and
finally,
it
fails
to
take
account
the
vital
public
interests
in
conducting
the
training
exercises
at
issue
unencumbered
by
the
injunction's
restrictions.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
certainly
we
would,
justice
ginsburg.
obviously
our
position
on
the
nepa
claim
is
the
same
with
respect
to
any
aspect
of
the
injunction.
so
too
with
the
risk
of
irreparable
harm
which
we
think
respondents
haven't
shown.
the
ninth
circuit
did
modify
the
injunction
by
issuing
a
partial
stay.
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
its
modifications
were
tied
only
to
a
stay.
it
didn't
actually
modify
the
injunction.
so
even
if
this
court
thought
those
modifications
were
appropriate,
it
would
have
to
vacate
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
the
ninth
circuit
framed
its
modifications
in
terms
of
a
partial
stay
of
its
decision
affirming
the
district
court's
preliminary
injunction.
that
stay
and
therefore
those
modifications
remained
in
effect
only
until
this
court
issued
its
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
right.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
yes,
we
are
here
complaining
about
the
restriction
on
the
2200-yard
shutdown
requirement,
where
if
a
marine
mammal
comes
within
2200
yards
of
a
naval
vessel
part
of
one
of
these
strike
groups
it
has
to
shut
down
sonar
operations,
as
well
as
the
75
percent
powerdown
requirement
when
significant
surface
ducting
conditions
are
present
regardless
of
the
presence
of
marine
mammals.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
the
record
--
and
here
i'm
referring
to
the
environmental
assessment
and
the
opinion
of
the
national
marine
fisheries
services
in
the
petition
appendix
and
the
joint
appendix
--
indicates
that
no
marine
mammal
will
be
killed
as
a
result
of
these
exercises.
the
environmental
assessment
predicted
there
would
be
eight
instances
of
injurious
harm.
these
eight
instances
would
take
place
only
with
respect
to
a
common
species
of
dolphins
of
which
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
in
the
southern
california
operating
area.
now,
the
environmental
assessment
also
predicted
that
there
would
be
a
much
greater
number,
170,000
over
the
course
of
two
years,
of
so-called
level
b
takes.
these
are
temporary
and
by
definition
non-injurious
disturbances
and
that's
made
clear
at
pages
258a
of
the
petition
appendix
and
page
175
of
the
ja,
which
make
clear
that
these
level
b
disturbances,
the
vast
majority
of
the
disturbances
predicted
by
the
environmental
assessment,
are
temporary
and
non-injurious.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
the
vast
majority
of
those
disturbances,
some
almost
90
percent,
pertain
only
to
dolphins.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
think
that
the
statistics
i
have
indicate
that
there
are
more
than
i
think
500,000
dolphins
on
the
western
coast
there.
as
to
--
the
number
may
be
actually
a
little
bit
lower
in
the
southern
california
operating
area.
but
this
is
--
no
one
suggests
that
is
in
any
way
a
threatened
species.
with
respect
to
the
species
that
are
endangered,
threatened,
or
even
strategic
under
the
marine
mammal
protection
act,
the
national
marine
fisheries
services
concluded
there
would
be
no
adverse
harm
on
the
population
level
or
with
respect
to
annual
recruitment
rates
with
respect
to
those
endangered
or
threatened
species
in
the
biological
opinion
that
the
district
court
sustained
and
that
respondents
are
not
challenging
on
appeal.
the
focus
of
their
claim
of
irreparable
injury
--
and
keep
in
mind
that
that
environmental
assessment
comes
against
the
backdrop
of
a
40-year
history
of
the
navy's
use
of
mfa
sonar
in
the
southern
california
operating
area
at
the
same
frequency
and,
if
anything,
during
more
frequent
training
exercises
than
have
been
conducted
in
recent
years.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
with
respect
to
beaked
whales,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct.
those
disturbances
are
temporary,
non-injurious
disturbances.
that's
important.
let
me
give
you
the
page
cites
to
the
record
on
that
because
it's
an
important
point.
ja
178
to
180,
ja
185
to
188,
and
ja
198
to
200
discuss
each
species
of
the
beaked
whales
and
explain
that
the
harms
that
are
predicted
in
the
environmental
assessment
are
non-injurious,
temporary
harms.
now
as
a
policy
matter--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--in
most
cases
it
means
that
there's
an
alerting
response,
they
hear
the
sound
and
they
go
in
the
opposite
direction,
as
one
who
hears
a
noise
that
disturbs
them
would
ordinarily
do.
it
can
also
mean
that
they
could
have
some
temporary
effect
on
their
feeding
or
breeding
patterns,
but
it's
a
temporary
effect.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
no.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right.
by
definition
only
a
level
a
take
involves
an
injurious
harm,
that
is
a
physical
harm
which
results
in
permanent
damage
to
tissue.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
it
is
confusing,
justice
ginsburg.
the
navy
as
a
policy
matter
described
for
purposes
of
the
environmental
assessment
the
level
b
takes
with
respect
to
beaked
whales
as
level
a
takes
because
the
navy
acknowledged
that
there
is
uncertainty
about
the
effects
of
sonar
on
beaked
whales.
but
when
you
look
at
what
the
environmental
assessment
says
as
to
the
actual
injuries
that
the
national
marine
fish
and
wildlife
service
and
the
navy
predicted
based
on
the
best
science
available
to
them
and
to
us
today,
they
are
non-injurious,
temporary
exposures,
and
that
is
made
clear
at
the
portions
of
the
ja
that
i
mentioned.
now,
the
navy
--
there
is
nothing
that
prevents
an
agency
from
characterizing
the
particular
harm
one
way
or
the
other
as
a
policy
matter
for
purposes
of
an
environmental
assessment.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
yes,
there
is,
because
we're
not
here
arguing
that,
at
this
point,
that
we
had
no
duty
to
prepare
an
environmental
impact
statement
because
of
the
intervening
event
of
the
council
for
environmental
quality's
emergency
circumstances
alternative
arrangements
determination.
that's
the
pertinent
administrative
event
for
purposes
of
respondent's
claim.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
yes,
it's
one
of
the
alternative
arrangements
that
the
navy
agreed
to,
is
that
the
environmental
impact
statement
which
has
been
under
way
will
be
completed
by
january
2009
with
respect
to
all
activities
in
the
southern
california
operating
area.
now,
that's
not
to
say
that
we
concede
that
an
environmental
impact
statement
was
not
required
--
was
required
at
the
outset.
the
navy
doesn't
concede
that.
it
litigated
this
case
up
to
the
point
of
the
council
for
environmental
quality's
determination.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
because
the
navy
devoted
its
best
resources
to
this
and
in
good
faith,
as
is
indicate
bide
the
293-page
environmental
assessment,
concluded
that
there
would
not
be
a
finding
of
significant
environmental
impact,
and
at
that
point
everyone
agrees
an
environmental
impact
statement
is
not
required.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
it's
going
to
be
completed
by
january
2009,
justice
breyer,
under
the
alternative
arrangements
that
have
been
approved--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
at
this
point
we
are.
the
point
that
the
navy
faced
in
january
of
2008,
where
it
had
an
injunction
against
its
use
of
sonar
in
these
training
exercises
and
only
an
environmental
impact
statement,
it
faced,
as
the
council
of
environmental
quality
found,
emergency
circumstances
in
terms
of
the
need
to
conduct
these
training
exercises.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
because
of
its
impact
on
national
security,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
there
are
three
fundamental
flaws,
as
i
indicated.
one,
we
think
the
ninth
circuit
just
got
the
nepa
claim
wrong.
the
navy
is
complying
with
nepa
through
the
alternative
arrangements
and
the
regulations,
but
the
ceq
found--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
we
would
point
to
a
couple
of
things.
first,
in
terms
of
the
statute,
nepa
says
that
the
obligations
of
the
statute
should
be
complied
with
to
the
fullest
extent.
and
it
doesn't
specifically
say
what
happens
if
they
are
not
followed.
these
are
procedural
requirements.
secondly--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--the
statutory
authority
that
we
find
in
nepa
for
the
ceq's
regulation
providing
for
alternative
arrangements
is
--
first,
it's
acknowledged
by
this
court
that
ceq
has
rulemaking
authority.
the
court
acknowledged
that
in
department
of
transportation
v.
public
citizen.
so
we
take
that
as
a
given.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
let
me
--
i'll
answer
the
question,
but
let
me
be
clear:
the
government's
position
is
that
we
are
complying
with
nepa
by
--
by
complying
with
the
alternative
arrangements
provided
by
the
council
on
environmental
quality.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
and
i
would
point,
your
honor,
to
the
language
in
nepa
that
says
it
should
be
complied
with
to
the
fullest
extent
possible--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--and
i
would--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
that
language,
coupled
with
--
which
seems
to
us
to
suggest
that
compliance
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
would
depend
on
the
circumstances,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
nepa
doesn't
impose,
doesn't
say
what
the
consequences
of
noncompliance
would
be--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--but
other--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
this
court
has
acknowledged
in
numerous
cases,
methow
valley
and
in
the
public
citizen
case
a
few
years
ago,
that
nepa
gives
ceq
rulemaking
authority,
and
that
this
court
gives
substantial
deference
to
the
ceq's
rules.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
to
implement
the
statute,
that's
right.
and
there
are
a
number
of
important
procedural
requirements
that
go
far
beyond
what
the
statute
requires
that
the
ceq
has
laid
out
in
its
regulations.
one
of
the
regulations
--
and
this
has
been
on
the
books
since
1979
and
has
been
implemented
some
40
times.
so
this
isn't
something
that
was
made
up
in
this
case.
it's
an
established
regulatory
practice
under
nepa
that
where
there
are
emergency
circumstances
an
agency
can
come
up
with
alternative
arrangements
to
comply
with
its
nepa
obligations.
and
here
those
alternative
arrangements
were:
one,
to
complete
an
eis
that
is
under
way
for
all
sonar
activities
and
all
other
activities
by
the
navy
in
the
southern
california
operating
area
by
january
2009.
the
navy
is
going
to
meet
that
goal.
two,
to
adopt
the
mitigation
measures
spelled
out
in
the
alternative
arrangements.
three,
to
provide
for
public
participation
so
that
there
could
be
comment
on
any
concerns
to
marine
mammals
in
the
area.
and
four,
to
provide
for
research
into
harms
to
marine
mammals.
these
were
significant
arrangements
that
the
navy
agreed
to.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
it
has
--
it's
important
because
the
environmental
impact
statement
that's
going
to
be
completed
pertains
not
only
to
comptuex
and
jtf
exercises
that
will
be
completed
in
the
southern
california
operating
area
in
the
future,
but
all
activities.
so
that
environmental
impact
statement
is
going
to
be
very
meaningful.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
i
think--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--for
several
reasons,
justice
souter.
first,
there
was
a
gap
between
when
the
navy
issued
its
environmental
assessment
and
when
the
first
training
exercises
began.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
i
believe
--
i
believe
that's
right,
but
there
was
a
gap
and
there's
no
--
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--sure.
absolutely.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--it
did,
and
it
also
knew
that
it
was
in
the
process
of
finalizing
an
environmental
impact
statement
that
it
prepared
in
good
faith,
a
293-page
statement,
which
concluded
that
there
would
be--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--an
environmental
assessment,
that's
right,
with
the
finding
of
no
significant
environmental
impact.
this
court
presumes
the
regularity
of
administrative
actions.
there's
no
reason
for
the
navy,
particularly
on
this
record,
to
have
assumed
that
that
ea
would
not
have
been
sustained.
the
emergency
circumstances
arose
in
january
2008,
when
the
district
court
enjoined
the
use
of
mfa
sonar
in
these
exercises
when
the
navy
had
several
exercises.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
with
respect,
i
don't
think
that
a
293-page
environmental
assessment
with
the
kind
of
detail
and
support
that
this
assessment
has--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
that's
right.
and
as
i
indicated
earlier
--
i
want
to
be
clear
--
the
navy
believes
that
its
environmental
assessment
was
not
only
prepared
in
good
faith,
but
was
appropriate
and
reached
the
right
conclusions.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
the
other
two
are:
one,
the
injunction.
even
if
you
agree
with
respondents
on
the
likelihood
of
success
of
the
nepa
claim,
it's
based
on
a
showing
of
irreparable
injury
that
is
fundamentally
flawed.
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
district
court
looked
to
whether
there
was
irreparable
injury
under
a
possibility
standard.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
they
did,
justice
souter,
and
we
think--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
don't
think
that
a
court
could
say
that,
justice
souter,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first,
when
a
lower
court
applies
a
fundamentally
wrong
standard
to
assess
--
to
make
a
determination,
this
court
usually
corrects
that
legal
standard
and
gives
the
--
the
lower
court
an
opportunity
to
do
it
again.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
and,
two,
the
finding,
which
is
a
sentence
in
the
district
court
decision
repeated
by
the
court
of
appeals,
of
"near
certainty
of
harm
to
marine
mammals.
"
is
utterly
belied
by
the
environmental
assessment
in
this
case
as
well
as
the
fact
that
--
and
the
ninth
circuit
acknowledged
this
--
the
navy
has
been
using
mfa
sonar
in
the
southern
california
operating
area
for
more
than
40
years
and
no
one
can
point
to
any
harm
to
marine
mammals.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
yes.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't
think
it
is,
justice
stevens.
i
think
it
is
--
the
normal
practice
is
to
require
someone
who
seeks
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
a
preliminary
injunction
to
show
irreparable
injury,
a
likelihood
of
irreparable
injury.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
you
do.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
don't
have
authority
for
that
precise
proposition
because
i
don't--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--i
--
i
think
that
that's
right,
judge
scalia.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
clearly,
the
purpose
of
the
requirements
under
nepa
are
to
ensure
that
the
agency
has
--
is
making
an
informed
decision,
and
here
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
the
navy
was
after
its
293-page
assessment.
i
am
not
aware
of
any--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
i'm
not,
justice
souter.
i
am
saying--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
right,
but
then--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--i
--
the
eis--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--but
it
is
not
a
likely
--
they
have
not
shown
a
likelihood
of
irreparable
injury.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
we
agree
with
that.
we
think
it's
important,
though,
to
separate
out
the
likelihood
of
success
on
the
nepa
claim
with
the
distinct
question
of
whether
there
is
irreparable
injury
and
look
to
the
record
of
whether
there
is
irreparable
injury.
and
we
think
they
have
not
come
close
to
establishing
that.
the
one
final--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--justice
kennedy,
i
haven't
completed
that
--
that
research
with
respect
to
all
of
the
circuits,
but
i
am
confident
in
saying
i
am
not
aware
of
a
decision
in
which
a
court
has
said
that
the
irreparable
injury
requirement
does
not
have
to
be
met
or
is
automatically
met.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
and
it
may
be
easier
in
some
cases
than
others,
justice
stevens.
but
i
think
in
this
case
where
you
have
the
record
that
has
been
compiled,
they
cannot
--
they
cannot--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--we're
not
taking
that
position,
justice
stevens.
we're
taking
the
position
that
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
show
a
likelihood
of
irreparable
injury.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
fundamentally--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--we
--
we
are
contesting
that.
and
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
and
one
must
--
i
can
explain,
if
you
would
like,
justice.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
if
i
misspoke,
i
apologize.
my
point
was
that
the
administrative
determination
that
is
at
issue
now
in
evaluating
the
nepa
claim
is
the
finding
of
alternative
arrangements.
the
navy
has
never
conceded
that
it
was
required
to
do
an
eis
at
the
outset.
it
simply
has
agreed
to
live
with
the
alternative
arrangements
approved
by
the
council
on
environmental
quality.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
adequately
consider
the
balance
of
equities.
it
completely
disregarded
the
president's
determination
of
the
paramount
interests
in
these
exercises.
it
disregarded
the
chief
naval
officer's
evidence
on
the
harm
of
the
2200-yard
shutdown,
at
pet.

a.
justice
alito,
there
is
--
the
ea
says,
quote,
on
page
200
of
the
ja,
"no
serious
injury
or
mortality
of
any
marine
mammal
species
is
reasonably
foreseeable
because
of
these
exercises.
"
page
170
makes
clear
that
that
applies
to
beaked
whales
as
well.
and
finally
i
think
i
heard
my
colleague,
my
friend,
concede
that
you
have
to
show
article
iii
injury
in
order
to
show
irreparable
injury.
they
not
only
have
to
show
irreparable
injury
to
marine
mammals,
which
they
haven't;
they
have
to
show
irreparable
injury
to
themselves,
and
particularly
as
to
beaked
whales,
which
none
of
the
declarants
and
none
of
their
members
have
ever
asserted
they
have
seen.
they
can't
possibly
establish
any
irreparable
injury
from
any
conceivable
harm
to
beaked
whales,
even
though
the
record
in
this
case
makes
clear
that
all
harms
to
the
marine
mammals
that
we
have
been
discussing
today
are
temporary
non-injurious
harms.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
set
aside
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
which
seriously
interferes
with
critical
training
exercises
that
the
president,
his
chief
naval
officers
have
determined
to
be
in
the
paramount
interests
of
the
united
states.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
it
pertains
to
beaked
whales
as
well.
page
256
of
the
petition
appendix
is
the
national
marine
fisheries
service's
determination
that
the
conditions
which
led
to
strandings
with
respect
to
beaked
whales
in
other
parts
of
the
world
are
not
likely
to
lead
to
strandings
in
the
southern
california
operating
area.
those
conditions
are
taken
into
account
in
the
national
defense
exemption
mitigation
measures
at
page
228
of
the
petition
appendix.
there
have
been
beachings
of
beaked
whales
in
southern
california.
none
have
been
tied
to
sonar
operations,
and
that
further
underscores
the
absence
any
injury
to
any
marine
mammal
in
southern
california
despite
40
years
of
the
navy's
use
of
sonar
operations
in
that
area.
