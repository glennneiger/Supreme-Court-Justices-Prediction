justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
mentioned
the
effect
on
naval
operations.
on
the
other
side,
could
you
say
what
the
record
shows
about
the
number
of
marine
mammals
that
are
likely
to
be
killed
or
receive
actual
physical
injury
if
the
--
as
opposed
to
some
sort
of
behavioral
modification,
if
the
injunction
is
allowed
to
continue?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
lay
terms,
what
does
that
mean?
does
it
mean
an
alteration
of
their
swimming
pattern,
their
migration
pattern?
what
does
it
mean?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
there's
a
physical
injury
to
them,
does
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
means
that
they
may
just
swim
in
a
different
direction.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
there
something
incredibly
odd
about
a
single
district
judge
making
a
determination
on
that
defense
question
that
is
contrary
to
the
determination
that
the
navy
has
made?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
in
the
record
--
this
was
the
question
i
asked
general
garre.
where
in
the
record
is
there
evidence
of
--
that
beaked
whales
would
be
killed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
does
level
a
take
--
maybe
can
you
put
this
in
lay
terms.
let's
start
with
kill.
where
is
the
evidence
that
beaked
whales
would
be
killed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
--
how
much
deference,
if
any,
do
you
think
the
district
court
was
obligated
to
give
to
the
navy
on
that
military
issue
about
whether
the
training
would
be
effective?
is
judge
cooper
an
expert
on
antisubmarine
warfare?
