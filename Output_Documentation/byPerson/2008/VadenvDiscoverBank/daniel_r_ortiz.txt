mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
poses
two
substantive
issues:
first,
whether
section
4
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
impliedly
repeals
section
1331's
"well-pleaded
complaint"
requirement?
only
if
it
does
can
a
district
court
look
through
a
petition
to
compel
arbitration
that
itself
contains
no
federal
question
to
ground
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
on
a
federal
question
lurking
somewhere
in
the
dispute
sought
to
be
arbitrated.
and,
second,
if
section
4
does
repeal
this
part
of
section
1331,
can
a
completely
pre-empted
state-law
counterclaim
in
a
pending
state-court
lawsuit
furnish
look-through
jurisdiction?
your
honors,
at
bottom
this
is
ae
dispute
between
two
radically
different
conceptions
of
federal
question
jurisdiction.
one
view,
respondents',
is
so
broad
as
to
allow
parties
to
compel
arbitration
in
federal
court
of
nearly
any
dispute
concerning
credit
card
debt;
and
one,
petitioner's,
narrowly
confined
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
those
disputes
where
the
arbitration
agreement
itself
arguably
arises
under
federal
law.
but,
your
honors,
the
ordinary,
the
original
meaning
of
section
4,
the
structure
of
the
overall
federal
arbitration
act,
and
the
purposes
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
all
militate
strongly
in
favor
of
the
petitioner's
view
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
here.
first,
the
language.
the
words
"save
for
such
agreement",
your
honors,
as
the
words
"save
for"
themselves
suggest,
necessarily
imply
that
the
agreement
exerts
some
negative
effect
on
otherwise
existing
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
your
honor,
the
--
those
words
"save
for
such
agreement"
were
originally
intended
to
refer
to
the
hoary
doctrine
of
ouster,
which
barred
the
federal
courts
from
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
such
suits.
the
words
"but
for"
suggest
that
the
agreement
itself
somehow
impairs
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
your
honor,
section
2
says
that
an
arbitration
agreement
shall
be
valid,
irrevocable,
and
enforceable.
at
the
time
when
section
2
was
enacted,
the
federal
courts
were
still
split
between
law
and
equity.
section
2
by
itself
could
well
have
made
such
arbitration
agreements
enforceable,
but
only
in
law.
section
4,
"save
for
such
agreement",
makes
clear
that
there
is
no--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--your
honor,
section
2
by
itself
would
not
have
made
clear
that
in
--
such
agreements
were
enforceable
in
equity.
as
justice
story
wrote
in
tobey
v.
county
of
bristol,
bills
in
equity
were
thought
in
the
federal
courts
to
be
ill-founded
in
point
of
jurisdiction
to
support
a
motion
to
compel
arbitration.
and
so
although
under
section
2
such
an
agreement
might
be
enforceable
in
law
--
damages
might
be
available,
penalty
clauses
might
be
enforced
in
law,
a
party
might
also
be
able
to
recover
the
expenses
incurred
in
an
arbitration
that
was
revoked
before
the
arbitration
came
to
its
conclusion
--
that
would
not
be
clear
that--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--no,
your
honor.
it
is
true
that
congress
in
the
federal
arbitration
act
abrogated
the
ouster
doctrine.
the
only
question
is
whether
section
2
would
do
so
by
itself
or
whether
section
4
was
necessary
because
of
the
division
between
law
and
equity
at
the
time.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
your
honor,
section
2
says
that
arbitration
agreements
shall
be
valid,
irrevocable
and
enforceable,
but
it
does
not
say
how
they
could
be
enforced.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
your
honor,
if
congress
wanted
to
be
very
clear
that
ouster
in
all
of
its
forms
was
no
longer
any
kind
of
issue
in
enforcing
arbitration
agreements,
it
took
the
extra
step
in
section
4.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
because,
your
honor,
it
would
be
the
case
that
arbitration
agreements
could
be
enforceable,
but
just
not
enforceable
in
the
way
that
might
be
most
helpful.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
your
honor,
because
there
were
separate
bars
at
law
and
equity
at
the
time
--
at
the
time
of
ouster.
under
law,
there
was
some
room
in
some
jurisdictions
for
there
to
be
enforcement,
not
across
the
board.
in
equity
there
was
an
even
higher
standard
at
the
time
against
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
but
that
particular
section,
justice
scalia,
is
meant
to
refer
to
ordinary
state
contract
doctrines
in
law
and
equity,
which
would
make
the
overall
contract
unenforceable.
the
"save
for"
language
is
specifically
directed
at
ouster,
which
is
a
jurisdictional
doctrine
rather
than
one
of
substantive
contract
law.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
your
honor,
the
respondents'
view
also
doesn't
take
into
account
the
other
provisions
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
itself.
under
their
view,
the
4
of
the
agreement,
since
the
rest
of
section
4
would
accomplish
exactly
what
they
think
the
look-through
doctrine
that
they
are
arguing
for
without
those
four
critical
words.
also,
sections
203
and
sections
205
show
that
when
congress
wanted
to
expand
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
it
knew
how
to
do
so
clearly
and
unequivocally.
and
in
fact,
when
congress
adopted
section
205
in
1970--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--justice
stevens,
the
point
is
that
"save
for
such
agreement"
instructs
a
court
to
jump
over
the
historical
ouster
doctrine.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
no,
your
honor,
because
the
underlying
dispute
between
the
parties
in
this
case
is
a
--
concerns
the
arbitration
agreement,
not
the
underlying
bank
debt.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
your
honor,
the
language
in
--
the
language
--
the
particular
language
of
section
4
is
meant
to
say,
save
for
such
agreement
but
for
the
doctrine
of
ouster,
setting
aside
the
ouster
doctrine
whether
there
would
be--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--no.
but
read
in
its
historical
context,
your
honor--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--well,
literally
at
the
time
it
would
have
been
understood
to
refer
--
to
refer
to
that,
because
ouster
was
the
whole
problem
against
which
faa
itself
was
first
enacted.
faa--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--not
quite,
your
honor.
what
--
the
rest
of
that
sentence
in
section
4
instructs
the
court
to
look
at
a
suit
concerning
the
subject
matter
in
controversy,
which
would
be
a
suit
seeking
specific
performance
of
the
arbitration.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
yes,
sir.
so
you
are
--
what
the
court
is
instructed
to
do
under
the
"save
for
such
agreement"
clause
is
to
ignore
the
historical
problem
of
ouster
and
then
to
see
whether
in
a
suit
brought
to
specifically
enforce
the
arbitration
agreement,
there
would
be
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
you're
not
quite
looking
at
the
agreement.
and
this
makes
clear,
i
believe,
that
ouster
was
the
problem
being
referred
to
in
those
four
words
in
section
4.
it
says
a
suit
arising
out
of
a
controversy.
it's
instructing
the
federal
courts
to
determine
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
for
a
section
4
proceeding,
which
was
completely
novel
at
the
time.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
with
all
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
a
little
bit
more
complicated
than
that.
the
federal
arbitration
act
uses
the
word
2,
once
in
section
4
and
once
in
section
5.
in
section
2,
the
word
"controversy"
is
embedded
in
a
larger
phrase:
"controversy
arising
out
of
such
contractor
transaction.
"
it
is
that
context
for
the
word
2,
both
instances
in
section
2,
it
is
referring
to
the
dispute
which
is
sought
to
be
arbitrated.
in
section
5,
by
contrast,
the
simple
word
which
appears
the
middle
of
4a
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
either
--
section
5,
which
deals
with
the
appointment
of
arbitrators
or
umpires,
it
says
5
context
that
the
word
"controversy"
by
itself
refers
to
the
controversy
over
arbitration,
not
to
the
underlying
dispute.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
your
honor,
that
--
this
court,
in
that
footnote
32
of
moses
h.
cone,
mentioned
language
that
refers
to
the
underlying
dispute.
in
the
context
of
both
the
sentence,
the
footnote
itself,
and
the
overall
case,
it
is
clear
that
the
court
could
not
have
meant
that.
that
phrase
is
followed
immediately
by
a
semicolon
and
then
the
word
"hence".
and
after
the
word
"hence"
in
that
same
sentence
in
the
same
footnote,
this
court
says,
"hence
an
independent
basis
for
jurisdiction
needs
to
exist.
"
which
in
context
makes
it
clear
that
it's
not
referring
to
look
through.
also
that
sentence
cites
a
fifth
circuit
case,
commercial
metals
company,
and
the
other
--
points
to
the
other
cases
in
it.
they
basically
show
that
an
independent
--
stand
for
the
proposition
that
an
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction
exists,
not
that
there
is
look
through.
and,
in
fact,
one
of
them
dealing
with
federal-question
jurisdiction
says
that
the
federal
issue
has
to
appear
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
the
rest
of
footnote
32,
your
honor,
is
all
directed
towards
--
towards
the
jurisdictional
inertness
of
the
faa
overall.
and
the
case
of
moses
h.
cone,
itself,
if
look
through
had
been
rigorously
adopted
there,
it
would
have
defeated
subject-matter
jurisdiction
because
there
would
not
have
been
complete
diversity
among
the
parties.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
your
honor,
that
seems
a
somewhat
different
sense
of
look
through;
but,
to
the
extent
that
ordinary,
background
1331
or
1332
principles
authorize
such
look
through,
that
is
appropriate
in
arbitration
cases
as
much
as
it
is
appropriate
outside
of
arbitration
cases.
it
is
petitioner's
contention
that
section
4
has
no
independent
look-through
force.
to
the
extent
that
look
through
is
appropriate,
it
is
because
it
is
appropriate
under
section
1332,
itself.
if
under
respondents'
view
section
4
operates
independently
to
authorize
look
through,
then
it
would
presumably
override
1332's
normal
principle
that
you
do
not
look
through
in
determining
complete
diversity.
and
it
would
have
the
overall
effect
of
paradoxically
reducing
the
number
of
petitions
to
compel
on
the
diversity
side
that
could
be
brought
in
federal
court.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
the
--
the
point
is
a
simple
one,
but
it's
sometimes
hard
to
express.
if
you
--
if
this
court
says
that
section
4
operates
independently
to
authorize
look
through
in
section
1331
and
section
1332,
the
courts,
district
courts,
will
be
in
the
position
of
looking
through
section
1332
petitions
to
determine
whether
the
parties
are
completely
diverse.
it
will
not
be
basing
the
complete
diversity
determination
on
the
parties
before
it
in
the
arbitration
--
in
the
petition
to
compel,
itself,
but
it
will
be
looking
through
to
the
underlying
dispute.
now,
in
moses
h.
cone,
if
the
court
had
done
that,
it
would
have
picked
up
the
architect
who
was
dropped
from
the
actual
--
between
the
actual
underlying
lawsuit
and
the
petition
to
compel
arbitration,
and
completeness
of
diversity
would
have
been
defeated
there.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
i
do
--
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
no,
your
honor.
the
question
--
1332
does
not
authorize
look
through
for
purposes
of
determining
completeness
of
diversity,
so
if
section
4
independently
authorizes--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--not
under
the
completeness
of
diversity,
your
honor.
to
the
extent
it
has
anything
equivalent
to
look
through,
it's
on
the
amount-incontroversy
side
of
section
1332.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
yes.
so,
under
respondents'
view,
there
would
be
--
section
4
would
authorize
a
look
through
one
part
of
section
1332
and
not
with
respect
to
another
part
of
section
1332
under--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--because,
your
honor,
if
this
court
authorizes
look
through
in
federal-question
cases
through
the
arbitration
agreement,
itself,
to
the
underlying
dispute,
then
if
that
look
--
and
that
look
through
comes
--
authorization
comes
from
section
4--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--then
in
1332
cases,
this
court
would
be
looking
through
not
only
for
amount-in-controversy
purposes--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--but
also
for
complete
diversity.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
that
would
have
the
effect,
your
honor,
of
not
allowing
the
petitioner
to
define
the
contours
of
the
lawsuit
and
would
actually
reduce
the
number
of
section
1332
petitions
that
could
be
brought
in
federal
court.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
your
honor,
if
that
is
--
that
is
an
implication
that
is
--
is
lurking
in
respondents'
position,
and
it
is
also
--
in
a
case
like
this
it
is
a
little
bit
worrying
as
to
why
ordinary
section
1332
principles
should
not
apply.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
your
honor,
that's
not
actually
the
way
you
use
federal
--
lower
federal
court
now.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
your
honor,
it
--
it
removes
the
petitioner's
ability
or
the
plaintiff's
ability
or
the
--
similar
to
the
plaintiff's
ability
in
an
ordinary
lawsuit
to
define--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--the
parties.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
because,
your
honor,
someone
could
not
bring
a
section
4
petition
in
federal
court
against
maybe
one
party
seeking
to
force
that
party
into
arbitration
if
there
are
other
parties
involved
in
the
underlying
dispute
where
there
is
no
diversity.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
that
would
be
the
implication
of
taking
the
kind
of
look-through
theory
that
respondents
are
arguing
for
in
this
case
and
applying
it
evenhandedly.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
but,
your
honor,
there
are
also
several
jurisdictional
gaps
in
the
act
that
are
created
under
respondents'
view.
the
critical--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--exactly,
your
honor,
and
that--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--when
the
--
no,
your
honor.
but
there
--
there
could
under
your
situation
be
large
parts
of
the
underlying
dispute
that
are
not
covered
under
--
and
still
left
to
be
decided.
it
is,
you
know,
not
the
case
that
necessarily
everything
would
be
subject
to
arbitration.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
this
court
could;
and,
interestingly,
that
wasn't
the
situation
in
moses
h.
cone,
itself.
there,
there
was
a
preexisting
lawsuit,
and
this
court
did
not
look
through.
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
problem
with
the
architect
being
absent
from
the
petition
to
compel
arbitration,
itself.
well,
your
honors,
there
is
also,
as
i
mentioned,
strange
jurisdictional
gaps
that
are
created
under
respondents'
view
of
this
case.
section
4
is
the
only
section
of
the
arbitration
--
in
the
federal
arbitration
act
that
has
the
critical
7,
9,
10,
and
11,
which
allow
a
court,
a
federal
court,
to
compel
the
attendance
of
witnesses
at
ab
arbitration.
that
is
section
7;
and
then
9,
10,
and
11,
which
respectively
allow
a
federal
court
to
confirm,
vacate,
or
modify
an
arbitration
once
it
has
happened.
none
of
those
sections
contain
language
which
under
respondents'
view
or
the
fourth
circuit's
view
are
necessary
for
there
to
be
look
through.
in
all
those
cases
--
situations,
your
honor,
the
federal
courts
would
be
in
the
position
of
being
able
to
compel
arbitration
under
section
4
but
not
being
able
to
compel
the
attendance
of
witnesses
at
the
arbitration
or
to
subsequently
confirm,
vacate,
or
modify
an
award
coming
from
an
arbitration
that
they,
themselves,
compelled.
the
closest
respondent
comes
to
sort
of
explaining
this
or
trying
to
jump
or
leap
over
this
gap,
are
two
amici,
two
law
professors,
who
argue
that
this
court
should
find
jurisdiction,
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
sections
7,
9,
10
and
11
as
an
emanation
from
sections
3
and
4,
only
one
of
which
actually
has
the
necessary
"save
for"
language.
also,
your
honors,
this
look-through
approach
to
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
violates
the
core
purposes
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
federal
arbitration
act
was
meant
to
get
things
to
arbitration
quickly
and
to
have
arbitrators,
not
judges,
decide
them.
these
--
sometimes
often
complex
jurisdictional
inquiries
undermine
both
those
aims.
here
this
case
has
been
pending
in
federal
court
just
at
the
jurisdictional
stage
for
many
years
now.
in
the
strong
case
which
is
now
en
banc
before
the
fifth
circuit
--
i'm
sorry,
the
eleventh
circuit
--
justice
--
judge
--
excuse
me,
judge
marcus
wrote
a
32-page
opinion.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
your
honor,
he
didn't
say
it
had
to
be
rewritten.
he
said
if
you
wanted
to
make
it
even
clearer
what
was
originally
intended
under
section
4
that
is
how
you
would
do
it.
that's
a
far
cry
from
saying
that
you
need
to
do
violence
to
the
statute.
here--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--your
honor,
if
his
rewriting,
given
the
disappearance
of
the
ouster
doctrine
--
he's
trying
to
make
it
clear
to
present
context
what
was
originally
understood
at
the
time
the
congress
originally
enacted
the
faa.
there
is
no
memory,
historical
memory
or
otherwise,
of
the
ouster
doctrine,
no
realization
how
it
actually
played
out;
and
against
that
absence
of
knowledge,
judge
marcus
is
trying
to
educate
his
readers
and
the
lower
courts
as
to
how
things
need
to
be
done.
but
certainly
the
language
as
originally
understood
would
have
--
that
save-for
language
would
have
been
all
about,
which
it
is
clear
from
the
time
was
thought
by
congress
to
be
the
major
obstacle
to
arbitration.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
no,
your
honor.
now--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--the
explanation,
your
honor,
is
that
in
new
york
law
and
equity
have
been
merged.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
by
the
later
times
it
appeared
that
it
was
closer,
coming
--
the
law
and
equity
across
many
jurisdictions
was
coming
closer,
but
at
the
time
in
the
federal
court
system
at
least,
if
only
because
of
justice
story's
hostility
towards
jurisdiction,
finding
jurisdiction
in
the
tobey
case
to
build
equity
seeking
specific
performance
kinds
of
things,
that
language
is
necessarily
clear.
your
honors,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
a
few
quick
points.
i
think
this
court
should
be
exactly
clear
how
much
federal
question
jurisdiction
the
look-through
theory
would
create.
so
long
as
a
federal
issue
can
be
imagined
anywhere
in
the
lawsuit,
there
would
be
federal
question
jurisdiction
under
this
theory,
and
this
is
almost
by
definition
going
to
be
the
case
in
any
dispute
concerning
credit
card
debt,
either
because
of
the
theory
of
complete
pre-emption
from
the
fdia,
or
because
of
the
theory
used
in
the
strong
case
before
the
eleventh
circuit
that
rico's
prohibition
on
the
collection
of
unlawful
debt--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
no
--
there
--
in
general,
if
you
accepted
their
theory,
as
long
as
there
is
an
issue
that
could
be
spun
as
a
federal
issue
which
there
will
always
be
in
a
credit
card
debt
collection
case
and
just
--
in
most
states,
that
on
look-through
theory
would
be--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--your
honor,
every
--
it
does
not
have
to
be
a
class
action
to
establish
what
would
serve--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--well,
your
honor,
respondent
argues
that
this
is
an
easy
case,
or
at
least
over
time
the
courts
will
decide
these
things
to
make
the
jurisdictional
inquiry
--
inquiries
clear.
petitioner
does
not
believe
that
is
true.
for
example,
here
the
real
party
in
interest
dispute
consumed
much
of
the
court's
time.
the
lower
courts
have
gone
both
ways
on
this
issue.
it's
incredibly
fact-dependent.
there
is
no
easy
answer
for
it.
also,
your
honor,
petitioner
does
not
believe
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
would
have
been
appropriate
in
this
case.
declaratory
judgments
are
discretionary
and
in
this
context
of
where
you
have
a
pending
state
court
lawsuit
petitioner
believes
that
a
federal
district
court
would
be
very
cautious
before
permitting
one.
also
your
honor,
if
in
the
context
of
declaratory
judgment
action
presumably
the
district
court
would
have
to
take
the
state
court
admission
into
account,
and
in
particular
here
it
was
admitted
that
the
account
was
with
discover
financial
services
not
with
the
bank.
also,
your
honors,
this
--
respondents
try
to
portray
petitioner's
position
as
siphoning
off
all
federal
question
jurisdiction.
that
is
not
true.
under
petitioner's
view,
a
lot
of
federal
question
jurisdiction
--
some
would
remain.
it
would
just
be
that
the
arbitration
agreement
itself
would
have
to
sound
in
federal
law.
erisa
arbitration
agreements
would
still
be
covered.
some
labor
agreements
would
still
be
covered.
there
would
be--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--would
still
be
covered
under
petitioner's
theory
of
what
section
4
means.
so
for
example,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--would
still
be
in
federal
court.
thank
you.
