justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
just
not
getting
the
--
i
have
never
understood
this
argument
and
i
still
don't
understand
it
now.
what
is
it
in
the
text
of
section
2
that
would
seem
to
leave
it
inadequate
to
touch
equity
as
well
as
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
exactly.
and
why,
therefore,
would
anyone
--
why
would
anyone
be
drawing
distinctions
as
to
how?
it
would
be
enforceable
in
any
way
that
an
agreement
might
appropriately
be
enforced
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
at
the
time
--
or
any
courts,
for
that
matter,
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
--
it
made
a
categorical
statement
in
section
2.
why
did
it
need
to
be
any
clearer
than
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
could
be,
but
why
in
the
world
would
anyone
draw
that
inference?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
does
it
set
aside?
this
is
the
thing
i
guess
i
don't
understand
about
the
case,
and
that
is
what
is
really
driving
your
side,
given
the
difficulties
that
i
share
with
the
justices
on
my
right
and
left
here.
and
the
--
the
tacit
assumption
seems
to
be
that
you
in
fact
are
going
to
get
shortchanged
on
your
arbitration
right
if
you
have
to
bring
your
arbitration
claim
in
a
state
court.
and
i
don't
see
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know
section
4
doesn't,
but
section
2
does.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can
--
based
on
the
federal
act,
you
can
in
state
court
claim
your
right
to
enforce
the
arbitration
agreement.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
you
do
it
in
the
state
court
instead
of
going
through
these
gymnastics?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
bring
that
up
here
on
appeal
from
the
state
court.
