we
will
hear
argument
next
in
vaden
v.
discover
bank.
mr.
ortiz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
simply
means
that
you
can't
bring
an
action
in
federal
court
because
the
agreement
says
you
can't.
the
agreement
says
you've
got
to
arbitrate.
so
if
you
throw
the
agreement
out
save
for
such
agreement,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
you
could
then
bring
the
action
in
federal
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
a
tough
--
it's
a
tough
sell.
when
you
say
"save
for
such
agreement",
which
i
agree
with
justice
stevens
seems
to
me
you've
put
the
agreement
aside
and
then
you
say
right
away
then
you
look
at
the
agreement
to
see
if
there
is
federal
jurisdiction
and
only
the
agreement,
not
through
that.
so
you're
throwing
it
out
and
then
you
bring
it
right
back
in.
it
seems--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--of
the
arbitration
agreement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
and
i
guess
it's
--
i
mean,
you
say
if
it
said
save
for
the
historic
doctrine
of
ouster,
then
it
would
be
easy
to
say,
and
then
you
look
at
the
arbitration
agreement.
but
it
says
"save
for
such
agreement"
and
then
you
look
at
the
agreement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
do
think
--
you
do
think
we
should
look
through
to
determine
diversity
and
the
amount
in
question?
in
other
words,
not
in
the
federal-question
context,
but
if
it's
diversity,
you
say
we
do
look
through
the
arbitration
agreement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
hold
up
just
a
second
to
make
sure
i
understand
it.
you
are
saying
that,
let's
say,
person
a
has
an
arbitration
agreement
that
implicates
persons
b
and
c.
c
is
diverse,
but
b
is
not.
they
could
decide
to
compel
arbitration
with
respect
to
b
and
leave
c
out
of
it.
but
if
you
follow
the
look-through
doctrine,
you
would
say,
well,
the
dispute
is
between
a
and
b
and
c;
and
so
you
would
be
depriving
a
of
their
right
to
frame
their
own
complaint
in
a
way
that
doesn't
create
federal
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
i
suppose
how
that
works
depends
on
what
the
rules
are
about
how
you
frame
the
dispute
once
you
do
look
through.
i
mean,
if
there
is
a
pending
state
suit
between
a
and
b,
even
though
c
may
--
you
could
have
sued
c
as
well,
i
mean
the
judge
can
say,
well,
i
am
only
going
to
look
through
to
what
the
--
the
actual
litigation
is;
and
if
i
look
at
that,
that's
not
a
federal
case.
and
--
and
--
and
so
your
position
follows.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
and
what
really
leapt
off
the
page
at
me
in
that
opinion,
he
gets
to
the
end,
i
think
he
basically
presents
your
position
and
then
he
says:
thus,
on
my
reading
the
relevant
portion
of
section
4
could
be
rewritten
this
way.
well,
i
mean
that
to
me
is
a
confession
of
error
if
you
have
to
rewrite
the
statute
to
get
to
your
position.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
his
rewriting
doesn't
look
very
much
like
section
4
to
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who
gets
to
frame
--
who
gets
to
frame
the
complaint?
normally
if
you're
a
party
and
you
have
a
dispute
that
may
implicate
federal
law,
you
have
control
over
the
complaint.
you
don't
have
to
have
a
--
you
don't
have
to
well
plead
it
in
a
way
that
implicates
a
federal
question.
you
can
go
out
of
your
way
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
does
not
implicate
a
federal
question;
and
therefore
it
would
not
be,
you
could
not
bring
it
in
federal
court.
just
as
in
the
diversity
example,
you
can
specifically
avoid
suing
people
who
would
create
diversity.
but
in
your
position
the
judge
has
to
in
his
mind
write
a
complaint
and
see
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
or
not;
and
how
does
the
judge
decide
whether
to
sue
diverse
parties
or
not
to
sue
diverse
parties?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
hard
to
figure
out,
you
have,
let's
say,
a
franchisee,
and
you
have
a
dispute
with
the
franchisor.
and
the
franchisee
says
it's
an
antitrust
violation,
and
i'm
going
to
sue
you
under
the
california
antitrust
law,
and
he
does.
and
the
federal
court
says,
we've
looked
through
and
says,
well,
you
could
have
sued
under
the
federal
antitrust
law.
and
you
--
yes,
i
could
have;
i
deliberately
didn't.
and
then
they
say,
well,
this
is
something
that
could
have
been
brought
in
federal
court.
and
that
really
deprives
a
plaintiff
of
his
right
to
frame
his
complaint
as
he
sees
fit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
but
you
just
say,
is
the
dispute
one
that
could
have
been
brought
in
federal
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
it
could
be
brought
in
federal
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
ortiz,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
what
do
you
mean
would
still
be
covered?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
would
still
be
in
federal
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
the
court
opinion
in
two
cases
this
morning.
