justice

bader

mr.
ortiz,
why
isn't
section
2
of
the
arbitration
act
sufficient
to
take
care
of
the
ouster
doctrine,
whatever
may
have
been
left
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
sure
that
i
follow
that,
because
it
seems
to
me
--
where
did
this
doctrine
of
ouster
come
from?
it
came
from
the
courts.
the
courts
said,
no,
we
won't
enforce
arbitration
agreements
if
it
would
oust
us
of
jurisdiction.
why
would
a
court
reading
section
2
not
say,
well,
that
rule
never
made
any
sense
in
the
first
place,
so
we're
not
going
to
follow
it?
it's
not
any
rule
that
congress
has
imposed
on
the
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
may
have
been
the
historic
model.
this
was
never
a
notion
that
congress
enforced
on
the
courts.
they
imposed
it
on
themselves.
so
my
question
remains
why
shouldn't
the
court
then
say
this
agreement
has
been
declared
enforceable,
the
ouster
doctrine
didn't
have
much
to
recommend
it
in
the
beginning,
but
certainly
not
any
more;
we
can
change
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
just
--
you
just
used
the
words
"arising
out
of
the
controversy".
"the
controversy"
is
used
in
several
sections
of
the
arbitration
act,
and
"the
controversy"
in
other
contexts
means
the
underlying
dispute
between
the
parties.
"the
controversy"
is
not
over
the
enforcement
of
the
arbitration
agreement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
the
question
that
i
have,
mr.
phillips.
what
is
the
underlying
dispute
between
the
parties?
it
seems
to
me
that
your
look-through
argument
is
look-through
only
halfway.
that
is,
if
you
look
--
if
you
consider
the
controversy,
the
suit
that
was
brought
in
the
state
court,
the
controversy
is
here
we
have
a
customer
who
hasn't
paid
the
amount
charged.
so
we
have
a
suit
on
a
debt.
why
isn't
that
the
controversy?
you
have
to
make
the
counterclaim
the
controversy,
which
comes
up
only
defensively.
it
wasn't
brought
as
a
lawsuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
--
but
she
chose
to
assert
it
only
defensively;
and
it's
not
a
complaint
--
the
counterclaim
if
it
had
been
brought
as
an
independent
action,
everybody
agrees
qualifies
for
federal
jurisdiction.
but
the
litigant
who
has
this
claim
is
asserting
it
only
as
a
defense
to
a
claim
that
you
admit
does
not
qualify
for
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
the
practical
effect,
what
happens?
now
you
have
asserted
that
you
can
enforce
because
of
the
counterclaim
that
asserts
--
that
arises
under
federal
law.
but
you
say
it's
is
not
the
same
as
removal
because
the
underlying
claim,
your
suit
on
the
debt
owed,
remains
in
federal
--
state
court;
but
what
happens
to
that
claim
once
you
have
this
arbitration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
meant
--
i
didn't
mean
to
say
you
couldn't
get
affirmative
relief
on
a
counterclaim.
of
course
you
could.
but
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--chose
not
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--chose
not
to
litigate
the
case,
chose
to
--
well,
i'm
being
sued,
so
i'm
going
to
bring
up
this
claim.
it
wasn't
as
an
original
matter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
controversy
between
the
parties
is
the
credit
card
company
says,
customer,
you're
in
default
$10,000;
and
the
customer
said,
if
that's
so,
then
i
have
certain
offsets
because
they
charged
me
too
much
interest.
how
do
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
do
you
--
it's
all
part
of
the
same
controversy,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
would
be
nothing
inappropriate
about
a
state
court
entertaining
that
excessive
interest
claim,
but
applying
federal
law
to
it.
i
mean
the
--
1831(d)
says
that
federal
law
governs
the
interest--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
state
usury
law.
so
you
could
have
this
case
going
on
in
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
state
court
would
be
perfectly
competent
to
apply
the
federal
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
claim
doesn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
there
could
be
nothing
left
for
the
state
court
to
do
after
you
have
the
arbitration.
i
mean,
not
that
you
arbitrate
about
interest
due
on
a
nonexistent
debt.
i
mean,
you
have
to
have
the
two
things
together.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
just
can't
envision
a
case
where
what
you
haven't
effected
is
taking
a
case,
a
debt,
simple
debt,
no
diversity
a
state
court
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
remove
the
state
court
from
the
picture
and
gotten
it
over
into
federal
court
to
order
the
arbitration
and
any
follow-up
to
the
arbitration.
it
just
seems
to
me
you
have
effected
--
accomplished
what
you
could
not
have
accomplished
by
the
--
by
removal,
which
you
admit
that
you
can't
remove
on
the
basis
of
a
counterclaim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could
have
asked
for
that
in
the
state
court
as
well,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
isn't
it
proper
to
look
to
see
--
the
party
who
wants
arbitration
has
a
dispute;
the
dispute
is
we
are
owed
money
by
the
debtor.
why
shouldn't
the
court
say,
well,
we'll
see
what
your
case
is
about;
if
your
case
would
qualify
for
federal
jurisdiction,
fine.
but
we
are
not
going
to
look
to
see
what
the
defendants
cases
is
or
might
be.
we'll
just
look
at
your
case
and
that's
how
we
will
define
the
controversy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you'll
have
not
only
a
hypothetical
claim,
because
nothing
has
been
brought,
but
an
hypothetical
answer
by
way
of
counterclaim
to
that
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
would
come
into
the
court
and
say
there
is
no
suit
going
on
anywhere,
but
if
we
were
to
bring
this
suit
in
state
court,
the
defendant
could
have
brought
this
federal
counterclaim?
that's
a
lot
of
hypothesis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
excuse
me--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
do
you
do
with
the
assertion
that
sections
9
through
11
are
not
in
sync
with
your
view,
because
they
would
not
give
you
--
you
could
go
in
and
--
to
compel
arbitration
but
once
the
arbitration
was
award
--
an
award
was
made,
you
would
not
have
access
to
the
federal
courts
to
enforce
the
award?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
first
case
is
no.
07-773,
vaden
against
discover
bank.
section
4
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
authorizes
a
united
states
district
court
to
entertain
a
petition
to
compel
arbitration
if
the
court
would
have
jurisdiction,
save
for
the
arbitration
agreement
over
a
suit
arising
out
of
the
controversy
between
the
parties.
this
case
presents
two
questions
concerning
the
meaning
of
section
4.
first,
should
a
district
court
limit
its
jurisdictional
inquiry
to
the
discrete
dispute
about
arbitrability?
or
should
it
instead
look
through
the
petition
to
compel
arbitration
and
determine
whether
the
underlying
controversy
between
the
parties
presents
a
cognizable
federal
question.
second,
if
a
court
should
look
through
the
petition
and
focus
on
the
underlying
controversy,
may
the
court
exercise
jurisdiction
when
the
federal
question
arises
only
in
a
counterclaim.
the
case
we
decide
today
began
with
proceedings
in
a
maryland
state
court.
discover
bank's
servicing
affiliate
filed
a
state
law
debt-collection
action
seeking
to
recover
past-due
charges
from
one
of
its
credit
cardholders,
betty
vaden.
vaden
counterclaimed
alleging
that
discover's
finance
charges,
interests
and
late
fees
violated
state
law.
invoking
an
arbitration
clause
in
its
cardholder
agreement,
discover
then
petitioned
a
federal
district
court
to
compel
arbitration
of
vaden's
counterclaims.
the
federal
court
had
jurisdiction
discover
asserted
because
vaden's
counterclaims
were
entirely
preempted
by
federal
banking
law.
the
district
court
ordered
arbitration
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
ultimately
affirmed.
we
now
reversed
the
fourth
circuit's
judgment.
as
to
the
first
question,
we
agree
with
the
fourth
circuit
that
a
district
court
may
look
through
a
section
4
petition
and
home
in
on
the
party's
underlying
controversy.
the
text
of
section
4
strongly
supports
this
conclusion
the
phrase,
save
for
the
arbitration
agreement
instructs
courts
to
determine
whether
had
there
been
no
arbitration
agreement,
they
would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
substantive
dispute
between
the
parties.
as
to
the
second
question,
however,
we
hold
that
the
fourth
circuit
erred.
because
section
4
does
not
enlarge
federal-court
jurisdiction,
a
party
seeking
to
compel
arbitration
may
gain
a
federal
court's
assistance,
we
hold,
only
if
the
parties
underlying
controversy
in
its
entirety
could
be
litigated
in
federal
court.
here,
the
controversy
between
discover
and
vaden
was
triggered
by
discover's
garden-variety
state
law,
debt-collection
claim
against
vaden.
that
claim
plainly
did
not
provide
any
basis
for
federal
court
jurisdiction
and
it
is
well
established
that
federal
jurisdiction
cannot
be
premised
on
a
defense
or
counterclaim.
we
decline
to
read
section
4
to
enable
a
party
to
commandeer
a
federal
court
to
order
arbitration
of
a
slice
of
a
controversy
when
the
controversy
as
a
whole
would
not
qualify
for
federal
court
adjudication.
discover
we
note
remains
free
to
petition
a
maryland
state
court
for
assistance
in
enforcing
the
arbitration
clause
contained
in
its
contracts
with
maryland
cardholders.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
stevens,
breyer,
and
alito
joined.
