justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
a
dispute
between
people.
you
look
at
their
underlying
dispute,
the
underlying
one,
and
you
say:
is
there
diversity?
what's
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
--
why
wouldn't
you
do
just
what
i
said,
just
what
we
started
with?
you
take
out
the
arbitration
agreement,
and
then
you
look
to
see
what
this
dispute
is
about.
and
if
it's
about
something
that
happens
to
involve
all
people
from
one
side
in
one
state
and
from
another
state
on
the
other
side,
there
is
jurisdiction.
why
is
that
a
problem?
i
don't
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
theory
--
i
mean
basically
i
think
you
concede
that
the
other
side
has
a
point
in
sometimes
it
will
be
difficult
to
say
what
the
dispute
is
precisely
and,
therefore,
difficult
to
know
if
precisely
this
dispute
does
or
does
not
--
one
that
you
can
get
into
federal
court
on.
for
example,
it
hasn't
even
arisen.
you
know,
there
is
no
lawsuit.
and
i
guess
what
would
happen,
what
the
judge
should
say
is
they
should
say
to
you
you'd
like
to
have
this
in
federal
court,
wouldn't
you,
this
dispute?
what's
it
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
once
he
says
what's
it
about,
both
sides
will
say,
well,
basically
it
started
off
--
it's
just
about
collecting
some
money
from
in-state
parties.
so
that's
not
federal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that,
you
know,
something
could
happen
here.
it
could
happen
that
they
could
decide
they
want
to
sue
in
a
big
class
action
and
get
huge
amounts
of
money
under
usury
laws
of
the
state
which
don't
exist,
so
they
have
to
proceed
under
an
fdic
reg,
and
then
it
could
be
federal.
and
the
judge
might
say
to
you:
"what?
"
"you're
just
imagining.
"
and
that
would
be
up
to
the
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
kind
of
a
defense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you'd
say
then
it
might
be
the
case
that
it
wouldn't
be
so
hard
to
decide.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
real
suit.
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
in
a
real
suit,
there
is
a
class
action
brought
not
just
on
behalf
of
the
one
you're
trying
to
sue
but
on
behalf
of
everybody,
where
they
have
to
proceed
under
a
federal
reg,
and
they
are
going
to
get
a
huge
amount
of
money,
and
you
say
that's
what
we
want
arbitrated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
this
one
is
not
so
hard
to
figure
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
might
be
some
that
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
his
case,
in
the
chief
justice's
case,
wouldn't
you
say
they
don't
get
into
court,
probably
don't
because
they
are
bringing
this
under
a
state
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
right?
i'm
asking
if
it
may
sound
favorable
to
you,
then
i'll
get
a
good
response
in
rebuttal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
read
it
the
other
way
--
if
you
read
it
the
other
way,
the
way
the
petitioners
want
to
read
it,
then
is
this
so
or
not?
that
then
you
look
to
see
if
there
is
federal
jurisdiction
of
the
arbitration
agreement;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
under
their
interpretation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
what
you
could
have
is
you
could
have
two
parties
sign
an
arbitration
agreement
that
lasts
for
a
year
that
governs
all
disputes
between
them,
and
one
is
from
vermont;
the
other
from
california.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there
is
jurisdiction.
and
all
the
disputes
happen
to
involve
just
pure
matters
of
--
that
never
could
come
into
federal
court.
i
mean
there
are
such
matters
you
could
argue
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
nevertheless,
we
have
a
federal
court
issuing
this
injunction,
under
their
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
assuming
they
are
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
see.
the
arbitration
agreement
has
to
meet
the
amount
in
controversy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
then
probably
no
arbitration
agreement
in
itself
meets
the
amount.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
you
didn't
look
through,
then
this
would
apply
to
nothing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
arbitration--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
arbitration
agreement
has
to
--
they
talk
about
the
arbitration
agreement,
then
you
could
have
really
important
federal
questions
in
substantive
issues--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
couldn't
come
in
because
the
arbitration
agreement
doesn't?
or
you
could
have
state
questions
that
would
suddenly
come
in
because
the
arbitration
agreement
does.
the
arbitration
--
but
now
you're
saying,
well,
that
second
case
is
never
going
to
arise.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
probably
not,
because
no
arbitration
agreement
has
--
so
then
it
becomes
a
nullity
of
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
except
to
overcome
the
ouster.
okay.
we've
got
your
side
of
it.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
your
view,
but
i
mean
believe
me,
i
think
i
can
keep
that
problem
under
control.
that
was
your
original
point.
i
see
the
point,
it's
going
to
spread
too
far;
you'd
have
to
have
some
rules
that
cabin
it.
assume
i
got
that
under
control;
maybe
i
don't.
this
is
a
case
of
"well,
his
brother
was
worse.
"
what
do
you
want
to
say
about
the
criticisms
of
the
horrible
things
that
happen
if
we
adopt
your
position?
