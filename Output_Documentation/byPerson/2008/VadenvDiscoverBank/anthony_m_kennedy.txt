all
right.
so
you
define
"look
through"
as
--
under
our
hypothetical
here
as
looking
through
to
all
people
who
might
potentially
be
parties
under
this
arbitration
agreement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
will
think
about
that.
i'm
--
i'm
--
i
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
clear
to
me
that
that
was
so.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not
quite
so,
because
the
--
the
action
could
proceed
with
just
a
and
c,
and
then
it
--
it
could
come
to
a
complete
judgment
as
to
them.
in
the
look
through
for
the
--
the
claims
that
are
involved,
the
action
couldn't
possibly
proceed
without
taking
account
of
the
pre-emption
claim
that
the
federal
--
the
federal
claim.
you
couldn't
--
you
could
decide
the
case
completely
in
no.
1,
the
diversity
case,
but
not
in
no.
2.
so
there
--
so
there
is
a
difference.
it's
true,
you
don't
decide
it
completely
as
to
all
parties.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
speaking
of
gymnastics,
can
i
ask
you
if
you
had
foreseen
this
problem,
could
you
have
brought
a
declaratory
judgment
action
to
establish
that
your
federal
claim--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--controls
this
dispute
and
could
you
have
then
said
that
you
wanted
this
arbitrated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
didn't
you
do
that?
why
are
we
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
could
you
still
do
that
after
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
petitioner's
--
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
ask
the
petitioner
--
is
the
petitioner's
argument
for
a
limited
look
through
compromised
in
any
way
by
the
beneficial
bank
case
which
allows
removal
if
there
is
a
federal
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
of
course
in
the
context
of
a
defense,
as
opposed
to
a
counterclaim.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
a
federal
defense?
