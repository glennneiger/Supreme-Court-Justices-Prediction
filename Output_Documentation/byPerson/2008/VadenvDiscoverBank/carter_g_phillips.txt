mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
argument
that
just
ended
doesn't
prove
anything,
it
suggests
that
perhaps
the
court
ought
to
follow
the
simple
expedient
of
read
the
statute
as
it's
written,
apply
it
as
written
and
come
to
what
strikes
me,
at
least,
as
a
reasonably
easy
resolution
of
this
particular
case.
the
statute
says
that
a
party
aggrieved
by
the
alleged
failure
to
arbitrate
--
and
we
have
that
precisely
in
this
case
because
the
other
side
has
filed
a
lawsuit
against
our
indemnitee
arising
out
of
an
underlying
dispute
--
may
petition
any
united
states
district
court
which,
save
for
such
an
agreement
--
it's
pretty
clear
that
everybody
agrees
that
in
this
context
you
just
simply
put
the
agreement
aside
--
and
then
you
say
would
have
jurisdiction
under
title
28
in
a
civil
action
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
suit
arising
out
of
the
controversy
between
the
parties.
it
seems
to
me
reasonably
clear
to
interpret
that
language
as
saying
you
look
to
the
underlying
dispute
between
the
parties.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
ginsburg,
the
language
of
section
4
actually
talks
about
the
subject
matter
of
a
suit
arising
out
of,
not
the
existence
of
a
suit;
and
section
4
doesn't
require
that
a
lawsuit
have
been
filed.
so
it's
not
appropriate
simply
to
say
to
yourself
look
at
what
litigation
actually
exists,
because
in
as
many
cases
as
not
there
is
not
going
to
be
any
litigation
ongoing.
so
the
court
has
to
make
the
hypothetical:
would
the
court
have
had
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
this
dispute?
and
the
dispute
in
this
case,
which
professor
ortiz
was
very
explicit
about
--
he
said
specifically
that
if
he
had
brought
this
as
an
affirmative
lawsuit
it
would
have
arisen
under
federal
law.
it
seems
to
me
that's
as
clear
a
concession
that
the
nature
of
this
dispute
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
and
therefore--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
what
the
judge
has
to
do
is
to
take
--
is
to
give
the
plaintiff
in
the
section
4
complaint
the
benefit
of
his
allegations.
and
we
have
made
an
allegation
here
that
the
subject
matter
of
this
dispute
arises
under
federal
law,
and
we
did
that
not
just
based
on
our
own
assessment
of
the
situation
in
the
abstract,
but
we
did
that
on
the
basis
that
she
had
filed
a
very
specific
claim
against
us
asserting
that
we
had
violated
essentially
section
20.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
difference
is
that
we
are
not
seeking
to
remove
her
original
lawsuit.
that's
not
--
if
that
were
the
case,
then
i
think
the
argument
you're
making
is
a
legitimate
one.
all
we
are
seeking
to
do
is
to
assert
our
independent
section
4
rights
and
that's
not
at
all
dependent
on
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there
are
a
couple
possibilities.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
the
arbitration
agreement
is
quite
explicit
in
saying
that
if,
if
you
--
if
this
starts
off
as
litigation
and
then
a
subsequent
claim
is
made
by
either
of
the
parties,
the
parties
have
the
right
to
enforce
the
arbitration
as
to
that
particular
claim.
so
that's
specifically
what
we
did
in
this
particular
case.
so
in
theory,
at
least
the
collection
action
would
remain
in
state
court
as
a
state
cause
of
action,
although
it
would
certainly
be
available
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
say,
well,
no,
if
you're
going
to
arbitrate
that
portion
of
the
case
then
i'm
content
to
arbitrate
the
rest
of
the
case
as
well.
so
they
could
do
it
that
way
or
we
could
arbitrate
the
federal
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
right.
yeah
--
no
--
exactly.
that's
absolutely
true.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
i
couldn't
--
i
couldn't
remove
it--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
that
was
the
point
she
was
trying
to
make.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
i
--
i
understand
that,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
--
the
--
but
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
here
is
that
the
language
of
section
4
just
talks
about
the
subject
matter
of
the
controversy
between
the
parties.
it
doesn't
specifically
talk
about
an
existing
lawsuit,
and
frankly
it
doesn't
envision
the
existence
of
a
specific
lawsuit.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
in
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
--
no
--
well,
i
mean
you
could
--
you
can
certainly
view
it
as
part
of
the
same
controversy,
but
the
--
but
the
bottom
line
is,
the
question
is:
would
a
federal
court
have
jurisdiction
over
the
dispute
that
arises
under
federal
law
between
the
petitioner
and
the
respondents?
and
the
answer
is
clearly
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
defined
by
our
complaint
in
section
4.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i'm
not
sure
--
i'm
not
even
sure--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
--
i
mean
the
problem
with
that
--
i
mean
the
difficulty
arises,
justice
scalia,
because
the
language
of
the
statute
does
say
that
the
court
has
to
determine
whether
it
would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
the
controversy.
and
then
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
with
his
interpretation,
you
have
to
imagine
everything.
in
point
of
fact,
you
have
to
imagine
that
this
had
something
to
do
with
ouster
when
it
doesn't
use
the
word
"ouster".
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
has
to
do
with
equity
and
law
when
it
uses
"equity"
and
"law"
in
other
contexts.
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
no.
that's
true,
but
what
it
--
but
--
but
the
flip
side
of
that
is
that
this
is
a
section,
a
fundamental
provision,
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
that
apparently
was
designed
to
provide
a
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
for
the
gila
indian
tribe
claims.
it
seems
inconceivable
to
me
that
congress
had
that
narrow
an
interpretation
of
section
4
in
mind
when
it
passed
this
particular
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
i
think
all
of
this
really
is
talking
--
i
mean
this
is
not
significantly
different--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
it
may
well
be,
justice
scalia,
that
in
that
context
the
answer
is
that
the
court
will
say
that
the
claim
is
unripe;
that
we
don't
know
for
sure
whether
or
not
this
is
going
to
congeal
into
a
real
dispute
between
the
parties.
and
if
that's
the
case,
obviously,
then
the
court
does
not
have
to
go
forward.
but
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
that
in
the
context
of
this
particular
litigation
because
that
dispute
has
congealed.
the
parties
are
at
loggerheads
over
the
particular
issue
in
this
case.
and
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
although,
you
know,
that's
to
the
--
obviously,
that
sets
aside
the
arbitration
agreement
completely.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
first
of
all,
section
4
doesn't
apply
in--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
be
sure,
section
2
does,
but
whether
or
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
but
the
flip
side
of
that
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
we
have
serious
doubts
as
to
whether
or
not
in
fact
we
will
have
our
federal
rights
protected
as
zealously
as
we
would
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
kennedy.
i
believe
we
could
have
done
both
of
those.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
because
we
brought
the
action
under
section
4,
which
i
think--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--assuming
there's
no
statute
of
limitations
issue,
and
i
don't
know
that
there
would
be,
but
that
would
available.
but
it
still
seems
to
me
that
the
bottom-line
question
is:
are
you
entitled
to
bring
an
action
under
section
4?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
and
the
judge
would
have
the
discretion
to
decide--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
there
could
be
a
letter
that
says,
look,
what
you're
doing
here
violates
federal
law,
and
if
you
don't
stop
it,
we
are
going
to
take
action
against
you.
and
then
we
have
to
sit
there
and
wait.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
they
are
here.
they
are
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
that's
precisely
what
we've
asked
for
here,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
and
there's
no
question
about
that,
and
it's--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
i
understand
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
in
the
right
case,
you
know,
i'm
not
sure
how
i
would
come
out
in
that
particular--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--you
see,
i
would
comply
with
the
original
complaint.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
well,
that's
exactly
what
the
eleventh
circuit
held.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well
--
and
in
the
right
case,
the
federal
--
you
know,
if
i
had
to
go
that
far,
i
might
well
make
that
argument,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
in
this
case
i
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
and
i
think
all
the
court
needs
to
resolve
is
in
a
situation
where
the
parties
have
a
very
concrete
dispute
between
them,
one
that
arises
exclusively
under
federal
law,
and
a
party
seeks
to
have
that
claim
arbitrated
under
section
4
pursuant
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
the
state
court
suit
is
pending.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
state
court
has
stayed
its
hand
pending
the
outcome
of
the
federal
litigation.
so
we'll
see
what
happens.
but,
obviously,
as
i
say--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
mean,
in
some
ways,
as
i
say,
it
seems
to
me
that's
petitioner's
right
or
potentially
--
or
ours.
i
suppose
either
side
could
ask
to
have
that
arbitrated,
but
the
truth
is
if
you
took--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
see,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that's
not
right.
i
think
that
actually
what
happens
is
you
eliminate
what
i
perceive
to
be
the
federal
question
in
this
through
the
arbitral
process.
you
still
have
the
underlying
collection
action.
if
the
court
says,
no,
there
is
no
violation
of
the
usury
laws,
you
have
not
overcharged,
you
have
not
made
any
mistakes,
the
question
we
still
have
is
a
claim
on
the
debt
and
her
obligation
to
pay
it.
now,
whether
she
wants
to
adjudicate
that
in
state
court
or
resolve
it
as
part
of
the
arbitral
process,
that's
really
up
to
her
as
far
as
how
that
goes.
but
the
arbitration
agreement
could
not
be
plainer
in
saying
that
you
can
divide
up
the
claims
for
purposes
of
seeking
arbitration,
and
that
seems
to
fit
perfectly
well
with
an
effort
to
say
that
there
is
a
specific
claim
here
that
arises
exclusively
under
federal
law,
and
that,
therefore,
we
can
enforce
our
arbitration
rights
pursuant
to
that
section
4
right.
and
that's,
frankly,
all
we
are
trying
to
accomplish
here,
justice
ginsburg.
the
second
part
of
the
statute
which
is
the
--
you
know,
the
one
that
has
obviously
created
the
greatest
amount
of
controversy
here,
is,
you
know,
"would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter.
"
again,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
easiest
case
the
court
is
going
to
face
in
this
area,
because
here
is
one
where
there
is
no
question--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
what's
going
to
happen
--
i
candidly
don't
think
they
are
going
to
come
up
that
much,
in
part
because
these
issues
have
been
around
a
long
time.
you
know,
it's
not
like
there
have
been
dozens
of
these
kinds
of
issues
arising
over
time.
i
don't
think
it's
likely
to
be
that
big
a
problem.
but
again,
it
seems
to
me
that
district
courts
have
the
authority
to
resolve
this,
because
if
they
don't
believe
that
there
really
is
a
federal
claim
that
would
justify
exercise
of
section
4,
they
can
say
that.
if
they
do,
then
they
will
--
then
they
will
send
it.
i
mean,
look
--
the
other
thing
about
this
is,
you
know,
the
other
side
makes
a
big
fuss
about
federalism,
but
we
are
not
asking
to
take
the
issues
away
from
the
federal
court
--
from
the
state
courts
to
the
federal
courts.
what
we
are
asking
for
is
what
everybody
has
agreed
to
here,
which
is
to
have
these
disputes
resolved
by
arbitration.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
is
no
question
about
that,
justice
ginsburg.
the
problem
is
that
there
is
some
lack
of
confidence
in
the
state
courts
that
we
will
get
the
same
treatment
under
section
4
that
we
would
get
in
federal
court.
and
congress
created
that
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
wish
it
were
that
easy
to
get
this
court
to
grant
review
of
everything
that
i
bring
up
here
in
the
first
place.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
appreciate
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but
the
--
and
that's
fine
and
we
have
to
live
with
that.
and
obviously,
since
we
can't
change
the
standards
of
review
on
the
back
end
under
sections
9,
10
and
11,
we
are
going
to
be
pretty
much
stuck
with
that
--
with
that
determination.
but
the
truth
is
the
bigger
risk
is
that
the
trial
judge,
the
state
court
will
not
send
it
to
arbitration.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
it
wasn't
litigated.
it's
not
clear
on
the
face
of
the
opinion.
so
if
there
is
something
he
knows
that
i
don't
know,
maybe.
but
i
--
i
--
certainly
nothing
in
there
that
reflects
that
--
that
view
of
the
world.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
now,
the
nondiverse
party
issue,
it
depends
on
how
you
read
section
4.
you
know,
section
4
talks
about
the
parties.
and
the
parties
there
i
don't
think
means
parties
to
the
underlying
controversy.
i
think
there
parties
refers
specifically
to
the
dispute
in
front
of
the
court.
so
i
don't
think
the
pass-through
problem
for
1332
applies
in
that
particular
context
for
complete
diversity.
i
don't
think
congress
envisioned
you
would
look
beyond
the
immediate
dispute
under
section
4
to
see
whether
there
are
additional
parties,
except
to
the
extent,
obviously,
that
you
would
have
necessary
and
indispensable
party
litigation
that
might
bring
them
in.
i
think
the
assumption
is
you
take
the
complaint
as
it's
written,
and
then
you
look
to
see
whether
or
not
there
is
amount
of
controversy.
for
that
you
have
to
go
beyond
because
the
dispute
with
respect
to
arbitration
is
not
going
to
get
you
anywhere
near
that
number.
and
you
have
to
look
beyond
for
federal
questions
to
see
whether
or
not
there
is
a
federal
issue
there
to
be
enforced.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
not
going
to
give
a
good
response?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
under
their
interpretation?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure.
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
assuming
the
amount
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--assuming
the
amount
of
controversy
--
i
mean,
it
could
have
an
amount--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
it
has
to
have
an
independent
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that's
exactly
our
point.
that's
why
you
have
to
look
through.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
pretty
much
that's
our
view
of
the
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
i'm
sure
my
opponent
will
say
something
different
than
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
probably
not.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh
absolutely.
i
mean,
you
know,
in
a
situation
--
it
depends
on
how
you
interpret
it.
if
you
interpret
it
the
way
that
the
petitioner
does
in
saying
that
you
can't
have
any
look
through
--
now
he
softens
that
and
says,
well,
no,
you
can
have
look
through
for
diversity.
but
if
you
accept
the
idea
that
section
4
only
makes
you
look
at
the
dispute
at
the
arbitration
level,
then
the
reality
is
you're
going
to
have
no
cases
that
are
going
to
be
covered,
because
you're
never
going
to
satisfy
the
amount
in
controversy.
and
then
the
issue
is
why
do
you
get
to
look
through
for
diversity
purposes
and
never
get
to
look
through
for
federal
question
purposes?
and
it
--
it
seems
to
me
the
much
easier
way
to
reconcile
the
language
of
the
statute
is
to
say,
of
course,
you
look
through
to
see,
particularly
if
you
have
an
unquestioned
federal
question
dispute
that's
being
litigated
between
the
parties;
we
know
that;
there
is
not
an
issue
before
us.
in
fact,
he
has
conceded
as
much
even
here
in
court
today.
and
so,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
solution
to
this
case.
now
admittedly,
there
will
be
other
cases
where
you
may
have
right
in
these
questions,
and
there
will
be
other
cases
where
the
parties
will
have
to
fight
at
the
federal
district
court
level
as
to
precisely
what's
at
issue
and
what
the
plaintiff
really
means
to
be
fighting
over.
and
it
may
be
in
some
instances
you
won't
get
an
order
that
directs
arbitration.
but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
are
two
problems
with
that.
first
of
all,
the
statute
talks
about
the
subject
matter
of
the
controversy.
it
doesn't
talk
about
the
specific
controversy.
and
second
of
all,
the
statute
clearly
envisions
that
there
are
going
to
be
situations
where
there
is
no
complaint,
there
is
no
underlying
state
court
cause
of
action,
and
it
still
envisions
in
that
situation
that
a
district
court
is
going
to
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
would
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
precisely
what
the
language
"would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
the
controversy.
"
asks
this
court
to
make
a
determination
of.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
it
seems
to
me,
justice
ginsburg,
the
better
way
to
think
about
this
is
what
if
we
were
getting
letters
from
the
petitioner
saying
you
are
engaged
in
usurious
conduct,
you're
outrageous,
you
got
to
stop
what
you're
doing,
we
are
going
to
bring
a
class
action
against
you,
you
had
better
change
your
behavior
tomorrow,
and
they
don't
sue
us,
and
they
don't
sue
us,
and
they
don't
sue
us?
and
then
the
question
is
are
we
entitled
to
go
to
court
to
get
that
resolved
and
are
we
entitled
to
have
the
resolution
to
that
issue
as
a
matter
of
arbitration?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
well,
that's
--
actually,
you're
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
i
thought
your
question
absolutely
nailed
it
because
you
said,
would
this
--
you
know,
if
you
brought
that
suit
could
you
and
would
you,
and
the
answer
is
yes,
you
could,
and
therefore
you
know
as
--
without
any
question
that
it's
a
federal
suit.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
i
think
that's
no
doubt
that
that's
their
position.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean
the
interesting
thing
about
9,
10
and
11
is
if
anything
the
language
is
broader
than
our
language.
if
we
didn't
have
the
4
says
have
you
been
aggrieved,
do
you
have
a
right
of
action,
and
do
you
have
a
remedy
for
that
action?
i
mean,
without
this
rigamarole
that
we've
been
talking
about
this
whole
time,
we
would
have
--
we
would
easily
have
a
1331
action.
so
if
anything
you
would
argue
that
9,
10
and
11
arise
under
federal
law
regardless.
now
if
you
don't
want
to
go
that
far,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
just
say
you
read
sections
9,
10
and
11
and
pairing
material
with
the
limitation
in
section
4
and
you
wouldn't
read
it
any
broader
than
that.
but
there
is
no
basis
for
taking
the
unlimited
languages
in
9,
10
and
11
and
somehow
distorting
that
to
more
narrowly
limit
the
rights
that
we
have
under
section
4.
so
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
this
case
arises
under
section
4
through
section
27.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
it
does
create
it,
because
section
4,
without
the
"would
have
jurisdiction"
language
clearly
would
be
arising
under
jurisdiction,
in
my
judgment,
and
the
only
thing
--
and
then
it
places
an
additional
requirement
on
you.
you
can't
just
use
the
contract
that
gets
you
into
federal
court.
you
have
to
then
look
to
see
whether
you
would
have
had
an
underlying
cause
of
action
or
an
underlying
federal
claim
or
whether
there
would
have
been
diversity
jurisdiction
on
the
underlying
claim.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
i
think
--
i
think
the
reference
in
the
statute
to
controversy
clearly
envisions
the
underlying
dispute
between
the
parties,
because
it's
not
just
the
arbitration
agreement
and
it's
not
even
just
the
controversy;
it's
the
subject
matter
of
the
controversy,
and
you
compare
that
to
section
2
and
it's
clear
that
what
the
congress
has
in
mind
there
is
the
underlying
dispute
between
the
parties.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
i
don't
know
if
it's
compromised
by
it.
i
think
it
--
the
beneficial
case
makes
it
absolutely
clear
that
we
have
here
a
federal
claim
and
therefore--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
but
again
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
section
4
is
asking
the
courts
to
make
that
determination.
i
think
what
section
4
is
asking
the
court
to
look
at
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
controversy,
and
is
it
--
is
it
clear
under
the
circumstances
that
there
is
in
fact
a
federal
claim
underlying
it?
and
here
there
is
no
question
on
that.
i
ask
you
to
affirm.
