justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
the
same
problem
that
justice
souter
does,
especially
since
section
2
refers
to
equity.
it
says
they
will
be
irrevocable
and
enforceable,
save
upon
such
grounds
as
exist
at
law
or
in
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract.
obviously
this
--
this
section
was
meant
to
apply
to
equitable
actions.
you
wouldn't
dismiss
them
in
law
for
a
--
a
ground
that
only
existed
in
equity?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know.
when
it
says
they
are
enforceable
and
makes
an
exception
only
for
grounds
that
enable
revocation
in
law
or
in
equity,
i
would
--
i
would
think
that
the
general
command
was
meant
to
apply
to
both
law
and
equity.
justice
antonin
scalia
say
that
again.
i
didn't
follow
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
wouldn't
1332
require
complete
diversity
and
require
the
court
to
assure
itself
of
that
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
it
did
have
a
look
through,
an
automatic
look
through,
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
you
are
--
you
are
--
you
are
limiting
it
to
the
amount.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
dispute?
you
say
the
dispute
is
not
defined
by
what
--
what
has
been
brought
in
a
complaint.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
--
from
your
argument,
i
would
gather
that
a
court
would
be
able
to
imagine
a
counterclaim.
once
it
finds
out,
you
know,
what
--
what
--
what
the
principal
complaint
is
about,
the
court
could
imagine
that
there
would
be
a
counterclaim
for
interest
or
for
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
very
strange
to
decide
federal
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
--
of
imagined
--
imagined
complaints.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
problem
with
his
--
i
mean
with
his
interpretation,
you
don't
have
to
imagine
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
have
to
imagine
complaints.
you
--
you
don't
have
to
invent
litigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
close
to
inconceivable
to
me
that
congress
wanted
us
to
--
to
construct
litigation
that
is
not
yet
in
existence.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
your
position
is
it
doesn't
have
to
exist.
had
that
litigation
not
been
brought,
had
the
motion
to
arbitrate
been
brought
before
a
lawsuit
was
filed,
that
the
court
would
still
have
to
consider
what
is
the
dispute
between
the
parties
and
what
kind
of
complaints
could
that
dispute
have
generated.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
worries
me.
[laughter]
if
we
accept
your
theory,
this
is
the
easiest
case,
what
about
the
hard
cases
that
are
further
down
the
line?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
makes
a
nullity
of
it,
except
that
it
gets
into
the
federal
court
the
decision
on
the
arbitration
agreement,
which
was
the
object
of
this
stuff,
whatever
--
whatever
the
underlying
claim
is,
whether
it's
a
federal
claim
or
not.
as
i
understood
the
purpose
of
the
arbitration
act,
it
was
to
make
sure
that
arbitration
was
--
was
honored
not
just
in
federal
cases
but
in
state
cases
as
well.
and
it's
entirely
compatible
with
that,
that
sometimes
a
federal
court
will
--
will
direct
arbitration
in
a
case
this
involves
an
underlying
controversy
that's
purely
non-federal.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
can't
you
have
sort
of
modified
look,
through
like
a
modified
limited
hangout
or
whatever
it
was?
that
is
to
say,
you
can
look
through
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
arbitration
agreement
raises
a
federal
question.
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
have
to
look
through
to
determine
whether
the
underlying
controversy
raises
a
federal
question.
