justice
john
paul
stevens
i
hate
to
interrupt
you
here,
but
would
you
explain
why
the
words
"save
for
such
agreement"
cut
back
on
the
jurisdiction?
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
it
just
instruct
the
court
to
decide
whether,
if
there
were
no
such
agreements,
would
there
be
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
underlying
dispute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
this
case
there
would
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it's
not
the
underlying
bank
debt,
but
it
is
an
underlying
dispute
over
which
this
federal
--
if
you
had
brought
your
class
action
as
an
original
case,
there
would
have
been
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
why
doesn't
the
language
read
on
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
text
says
nothing
about
the
ouster
doctrine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
rather
than
literally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
point
argued
in
moses
--
moses
cone?
was
that
point
argued
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
--
i
mean
just
--
i
have
to
be
sure
i
follow.
why
couldn't
it
require
the
same
look
through
in
a
diversity
case
as
it
does
in
a
federal-question
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
complete
diversity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
it
would.
so
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--clear
up
one
thing
for
me.
is
it
correct,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
that
the
counterclaim
was
purely
defensive?
didn't
it
ask
for
additional
relief?
the
counterclaim,
wasn't
it
a
class
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
was
not
merely
an
defense
to
the
action,
the
state
court
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--answer
that
the
litigation
does
exist.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
get
one
fact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
state
court
suit
still
pending?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
are
two
separate
underlying
actions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
have
any
trouble.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
really
--
of
getting
constants
from
federal
judges;
the
arbitrators
can
decide
this
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
arbitrator
might
decide
there
is
no
preemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this,
i
haven't
reread
the
moses
cone
case,
but
is
your
adversary
correct
in
saying
that
there
would
have
been
no
jurisdiction
in
that
case
it
we
followed
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
arbitrator
was
not
of
diverse
citizenship
from
the
other
parties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
--
if,
in
fact,
were
a
nondiverse
party
in
the
moses
cohen,
there
should
have
been
no
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips,
the
answer
to
a
better
hypothetical
is
what
if
there
had
been
no
original
collection
action
but
they
had
brought
such
an
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
case
you're
really
saying.
you're
saying
that
is
like
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
justice
ginsburg
is
suggesting
it's
not,
because
it
happens
to
arise
out
of
a
different
--
quite
different
dispute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
your
opponent,
they
would
agree
there
was
no
jurisdiction
even
in
that
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
isn't
quite
true,
because
here
there
is
a
definition
in
the
federal
claim
in
your
counterclaim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
a
definition
of
the
controversy
in
your
counterclaim
and
in
their
response.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
suggesting
that
every
credit
card
debtor
would
have
a
class
action?
