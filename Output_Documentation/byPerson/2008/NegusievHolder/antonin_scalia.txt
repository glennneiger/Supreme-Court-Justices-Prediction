justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pincus,
could
i
ask
about
your
description
of
the
government's
position
as
saying
that
it's
purely
objective
and
that
there's
no
mental
factor
whatever.
is
it
clear
that
the
government
not
only
would
not
take
into
account
coercion,
the
fact
that
it
was
done
under
coercion,
but
also
would
not
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
individual
even
knew?
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
he
was
persecuting
somebody?
justice
antonin
scalia
has
the
government
taken
that
position
here
in
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
i
should
ask
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
could
think
that
that's
wrong
without
thinking
that
you
also
have
to
take
into
account
whether
there
was
coercion.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it's
very
--
it's
very
common
in
--
in
criminal
statutes
to
require
knowledge
of
the
act.
indeed,
if
the
person
doesn't
know
what
he's
doing,
you
know,
he
may
be
insane,
but
he's
not
a
criminal.
whereas,
it
is
not
automatically
clear
that
the
fact
that
the
--
you
killed
somebody
because
otherwise
they'd
break
your
arm
would
--
would
be
a
justification.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
two
are
quite
separable.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
wouldn't
balance.
so,
you
know,
gas
these
20,000
people
or
we
we'll
kill
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
gas
the
20,000
people,
right,
and
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
to
give
the
devil
his
due,
it's
not
just
the
bia
that
took
that
view,
it's
every
court
of
appeals
that
--
that
has
looked
at
this
provision
has
said
that
fedorenko
is
a
guide
to
what
it
means,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
faulting
the
bia
for
--
you
are
saying
it's
beyond
reasonable
interpretation
for
the
bia
to
adopt
the
--
the
resolution
of
the
ambiguity,
assuming
there
is
an
ambiguity,
which
comports
with
every
court
of
appeals
to
address
the
matter
has
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
think
that's
clear?
what's
--
what's
the
text
you
rely
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
i
have
it
in
front
of
me?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
gee.
i
mean,
if
this
is
central
to
your
case,
don't
you
think
i
ought
to
have
the
language
in
front
of
me
somewhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
wonderful.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
"see"
citation,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
you
know,
it's
just
not
a
flat
citation
which
would
say
that
governs.
it
means
this
is
a
relevant
case
that
you
should
look
to.
and
you
don't
deny
that
it's
relevant.
you
try
to
distinguish
it,
but
it's
certainly
something
you
should
consider,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
all
you
have
to
say
that
they
--
they
based
it
on
fedorenko?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
very
much.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
"see"
cite
again,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
that's
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
"citing
matter
of
laipenieks"?
justice
antonin
scalia
citing
it.
it
says
"citing
matter
of
laipenieks".
do
you
know
if
they
cited
it
just
flatly
or
was
it
a
"see"
cite?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
want
to
bet?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pincus,
can
you
tell
me:
what
is
the
consequence
of
this?
i
mean
if,
indeed,
your
client
is
--
is
denied
asylum
because
--
because
he
participated
in
--
in,
under
coercion
or
not,
discriminatory
action
against
others,
what
is
the
consequence?
he
is
not
sent
back
to
the
--
to
the
country
that
--
that
is
persecuting
him,
is
he?
well,
his
--
his
deportation
has
been
deferred
under
the
convention
against
torture.
so
he
has
some
--
some
protection,
not
the
protection,
not
the
full
protections
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
if
he
were
found
to
be
a
refugee.
what
--
what
happens
to
him?
does
he
--
does
he
stay
here
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--until
some
other
country
other
than
the
one
that
will
persecute
him
will
receive
him,
is
that
--
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
i
claim
i
would
be
subject
to
persecution
in
denmark
if
i
were
sent
there,
that
might
be
an
easy
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
unprovable
question
upon
unprovable
question.
i
mean,
to
say
that
one
question
is
really,
really
hard
to
figure
out
is
no
justification
for
laying
on
another
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pincus,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
get
the
bottom
line
of
your
exchange
with
justice
breyer.
is
it
your
position
that
there
--
there
has
to
be
some
--
some
coercion
defense,
but
it's
up
to
the
attorney
general
to
say
what
it
is?
i
mean,
he
could
say
only
if
he
were
threatened
with
death?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
only
if
you
were
threatened
with
torture,
not
if
it
was
threatened
that
your
family
would
be
exterminated?
where
do
you
get
that
discretion
in
the
--
in
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
any
old
coercion
defense
he
can
do
--
make.
so
long
as
there
is
some
coercion
defense,
that's
all
you
want.
some
coercion
defense?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
--
you
never
get
past
step
one
of
chevron.
you
say
that
this
statute
is
clear.
you
say
it's
not
ambiguous.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
pretty
ambiguous
if,
you
know,
there
is
some
old
coercion
defense,
but
we
don't
really
know
what
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
if
you
are
going
to
say
step
one
is
clear,
there
has
to
be
some
coercion
defense
that
--
you
know,
of
--
of
a
substantial
nature
that
the
attorney
general
cannot
fritter
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
katsas,
can
i
bring
you
back
to
aristotle?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
this
is
not
a
criminal
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
is
not
imposing
punishment
upon
this
person--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
some
malfeasance.
rather,
it's
--
it's
giving
a
grant
of
a
great
benefit--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
a
class
of
people.
and
your
position
is
that
it
has
narrowed
that
class,
perhaps
now
more
than
was
necessary,
but
that
the
government
thought
that,
rather
than
letting
in
and
giving
asylum
to
the
commandant
of
trebenko,
it
would
be
better
to
have
a
provision
that
simply
excludes
those
who,
under
coercion
or
not,
persecuted
others.
isn't
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--did
aristotle
say
anything
about
that?
limiting--
justice
antonin
scalia
--limiting
the
nation's
generosity
on
the
basis
of
a
provision
that
may
or
may
not
have
anything
to
do
with
blame?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
very
helpful.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
can
i
get
from
you
an
answer
to
the
question
that
i
put
to
mr.
pincus?
do
you
--
does
the
government
deny
even
the
necessity
of
knowledge
that
what
you
are
doing
is
assisting
in
the
persecution
of
somebody?
you
don't
even
have
to
know
that
you
are
assisting
in
the
persecution?
justice
antonin
scalia
good
for
them.
i
mean,
that
is
really
an
extreme
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pincus,
who
has
the
burden
of
proof?
assume
there
is
an
exception
for
coercion.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
applicant
would.
and
--
and
what
--
how
do
you
decide?
there's
not
going
to
be
any
evidence
on
the
other
side,
i
assume.
the
applicant's
going
to
say
i
was
coerced.
and
--
and
the
only
basis
for
rejecting
is
--
a
sufficient
basis
is
just,
i
--
"i
don't
believe
you"?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
do
they
have
shifty
eyes?
[laughter]
