i
am
quite
curious
why
--
i
am
curious,
why
did
you
answer
justice
alito's
question
"yes"?
i
--
i
would
have
thought
that
if
you
win
this
case,
the
attorney
general
would
still
have
tremendous
leeway
in
deciding
where,
when,
under
what
circumstances,
the
duress
defense
applied.
why
isn't
that
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
right,
then
why
do
you
not
--
why
was
your
answer
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not
any
statute?
i'm
mean,
starting
where
justice
kennedy
left
off,
you
said
a
hundred
years.
it's
thousands
of
years.
you
could
go
back
into
the
history
of
the
human
race--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you
will
discover,
of
course,
that
your
word
"involuntary"
is
never
something
where
the
action
is
involuntary
that
we
praise
or
blame
people.
rather,
every
action
where
we
praise
or
blame
people
must
be
a
voluntary
action.
the
classic
example
is:
"the
wind
blew
my
arm".
now,
you
are
saying
that
if
this
person's
arm
was
blown
by
the
wind,
that
this
statute
prevents
him
having
asylum
in
the
united
states
or
having
--
you
know,
withholding.
how
could
one
assume
that
involuntary
actions
are
covered
by
this
statute
--
are
not
covered?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
covered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
once
you
say
that,
then
let's
talk
about
intentional
actions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
are
you
going
to
have
intentional
actions?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
praise
or
blame
typically
involves
a
voluntary
action,
an
intentional
action,
and
an
action
where
there
is
a
degree
of
freedom,
which
is
to
say
that
the
choice
is
not
too
skewed.
and
we
see
that
in
the
criminal
law
by
a
reading
into
statutes
that
say
nothing
of
the
word
"intentional",
and
by
the
use
of
the
duress
defense.
now
what
reason
do
we
have
for
thinking
that
congress
didn't
mean
these
words
here
in
exactly
that
way,
which
traces
back
at
least
to
aristotle?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
but
aristotle
doesn't
say
criminal
law.
he
says
praise
or
blame.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
absolutely
right.
but
do
you
think
congress
intended
that
this
absolute
bar
should
apply
where
the
person
is
in
no
sense
blameworthy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
people
use
that
word
"intent"
in
the
course
of
the
human
race
to
encompass
the
notion
of
duress.
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
sometimes
done,
sometimes
not.
they
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
thing,
which
is
whether
you
can
blame
the
person
for
what
he
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
criminal
law
they
were
not,
i
agree--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
that's
--
because
we've
seen
the
need
for
specificity.
but
the
question,
i
think,
justice
stevens
had,
and
certainly
i
have,
is
why
do
you
read
some
aspects
of
what
it
takes
to
hold
a
person
responsible
into
the
statute,
but
you
don't
read
other
aspects
of
what
it
takes
to
hold
a
person
responsible
morally
into
the
statute?
