chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
07-499,
negusie
v.
mukasey.
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
there's
no
ambiguity
in
the
way
the
term
is
used
in
the
statute,
as
opposed
to
no
ambiguity
in
some
abstract
sense?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
where
--
the
plain
language
dictates
the
result,
where
do
i
see
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
--
if
they
say
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
dictates
a
particular
result,
i
say
--
i
suspect
that
that's
a
concession
we
are
in
chevron
step
one,
rather
than
two.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
pincus.
mr.
katsas.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
you
stopped
--
you
stopped
in
the
part
that
interests
me,
"participated
in
persecution
on
account
of
race,
religion,
nationality
or
membership
in
a
particular
group.
"
"when
these
people
are
forced
to
engage
in
persecution,
it's
not
because
of
the
victim's
race
or
religion;
it's
because
someone's
got
a
gun
at
their
head.
"
"so,
you
ask
them.
"
well,
why
did
you
do
that?
why
did
you,
you
know,
whip
that
person?
they
will
say:
because
they
were
going
to
kill
me.
they
are
not
going
to
say,
i
--
you
know,
because
i
was
biased
against
his
race
or
religion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
know
that?
why
can't
it
just
as
easily
modify
"incited",
"participated
in"?
you
have
persecution.
did
they
participate
in
the
persecution
on
account
of
race;
or
did
they
participate,
again,
in
the
persecution
on
account
of
what
the
--
what
the
force
exerted
against
them
was?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
just
bring
you
back
to
what
"assistance"
means.
if
you
--
normal
statutory
canon,
you
have
got
"ordered",
"incited",
"assisted".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
"assistance"
can
be
read
in
the
same
sense
as
ordered
or
incited
with
terms
of
an
active
--
i
don't
know
what
it
is
--
predisposition
or
desire.
or
it
can
be
read
in
the
manner
you
suggested,
somebody
who's
just
doing
it
for
--
for
the
paycheck.
so,
if
we
read
it
in
eiusdem
generis
terms,
then
i
think
your
response
falls
short.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that
argument
is
at
one
extreme,
where
if
this
does
apply
as
the
way
petitioner
suggests
we
assume
the
attorney
general
can
exercise
his
discretion
and
not
afford
relief.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
could
go
to
some
of
the
horrific
examples
that
mr.
pincus
suggested;
and
in
those
circumstances
the
attorney
general
could
exercise
his
discretion
to
afford
relief.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
so
too
would,
i
gather,
the
person
who
is
threatened
with
harm
if
he
doesn't
build
the
prison
walls,
right?
he
knows
they
are
going
to
be
used
to
persecute
people
and
hold
them
in.
i
mean,
if
--
you
know,
if
you
push
the
extreme
interpretations
they
go
either
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
he
--
does
he
persecute
people
on
account
of
race?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have
a
prison
here;
we
are
going
to
hold
members
of
a
particular
racial
group
here,
and
we
are
going
to
force
you
to
build
the
walls.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
speaking
of
--
to
get
back
to
the
language,
what's
wrong
with
saying,
you
have
a
clause
that
says
"otherwise
participated",
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
must
mean,
i
gather,
or
could
mean
that
"assisted"
does
not
have
as
broad
a
meeting
as
you
suggest,
because
otherwise
the
"otherwise
participated"
language
would
be
unnecessary
and
redundant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
right,
because
if
"otherwise
participated"
covers
--
"assisted"
does
not
include
"otherwise
participated",
and
i
understood
your
broad
reading
of
"assisted"
to
cover
the
prison
walls,
and
if
it
does,
then
i
would
say
"assisted"
needs
to
be
interpreted
with
"ordered"
and
"incited",
and
if
it
is,
then
"otherwise
participated"
should
be
interpreted
along
the
same
lines.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
there
was
just
a
--
it
was
a
belt-and-suspenders
redundancy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
i
may
have
missed,
what
was
your
answer
to
the
prison
walls?
the
guy
who
builds
the
prison
walls?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
he
or
is
he
not
participating
in
the
persecution?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
concession
--
statement
earlier
on,
that
there
are
going
to
be
situations
for
judicial
line-drawing--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
it
suggests
to
me
that
bia's
discretion
isn't
applicable
here
under
chevron
step
two.
because
what
you
are
saying
is
this
is
not
a
situation
where
the
statute
never
applies.
in
a
situation
where
you
can
logically
determine
and
your
answer
on
the
knowledge
question
is
pertinent,
you
can
logically
draw
a
line
between
what
a
person's
doing
and
persecution;
and
yet
you
said
the
courts
are
going
to
have
to
draw
lines.
so
bia
--
the
board
might
get
discretion
with
respect
to
where
that
line
is
drawn
and
when,
but
they
do
not
get
discretion
on
the
question
of
does
it
ever
apply.
and
what
your
position
is,
that
this
never
applies,
whenever
there
is
a
but-for
logical
intention
between
the
action
and
the
persecution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
would
say
the
woman
who
cuts
the
hair
does
participate
in
the
persecution
if
there
is
a
guideline
that
says
look,
we
are
not
going
to
execute
anybody
unless
--
before
their
hair
is
cut,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would
view
that
as
a
case
that's
not
covered
by
the
statute,
even
if
the
person
is
not
going
to
be
executed
unless
the
woman
does
her
job?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
katsas.
mr.
pincus,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
they
typically
have
views
on
the
underlying
persecution
issue
that
is
at
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
i
mean,
it
is
not
at
all
unreasonable,
if
you
have
a
clash
between
two
ethnic
groups
in
a
particular
country,
that
the
interpreters
are
going
to
have
views
one
way
or
the
other.
they
are
going
to
come
from
one
of
the
groups
of
one
or
the
other.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
actually
an
answer
but
go
ahead.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-499,
negusie
versus
holder.
