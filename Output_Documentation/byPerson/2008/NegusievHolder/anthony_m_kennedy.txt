do
we
begin
with
the
assumption
that
this
is
a
chevron
deference
case?
and
i
think
aguirre,
ins
v.
aguirre,
would
tell
us
that
it
is.
it
was
a
different
statute.
do
we
begin
with
that
assumption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
i
begin
with
chevron?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
government
is
wrong
in
saying
that
it's
bound
by
fedorenko
and
that's
the
reason
perhaps
for
us
to
send
it
back?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
do
we
begin
with
the
decision
in
rodriguez-majano,
the
bia
decision--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--which
cited
fedorenko?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
does
the
attorney
general
have
expertise
in
--
in
that
area?
i
can
understand
why
he
has
expertise
when
he
knows
that,
from
experience,
that
certain
defenses
are
harder
to
prove
than
others,
that
certain
evidence
is
harder
to
obtain
than
other
evidence.
but
does
the
attorney
general
really
have
expertise
in
determining
degrees
of
duress,
degrees
of
culpability?
is
that
within
the
chevron
framework?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
why
you
--
i
don't
know
why
you
concede
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
your
position
is
that
it
is
unbounded.
if
the
legislature
passes
a
statute
requiring
specific
intent,
scienter,
concepts
of
personal
responsibility,
we
don't
say
this
is
unbounded.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
saying
in
the
general
criminal
law.
we
don't
say,
oh,
this
is
unbounded.
this
is
what
courts
are
for.
this
is
what
adjudication
is
for,
is
to
establish
and
define
what
duress
means,
what
scienter
means,
what
degree
of
intent
is
culpable,
what
isn't.
it's
not
unbounded.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
arises
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
it
concerns
a
provision
of
the
act
that
is
commonly
called
the
persecutor
bar.
with
certain
simplifications
under
the
act,
an
alien
who
is
deportable
can
seek
refugee
status
here
if
he
has
shown
a
well-founded
fear
of
prosecution
in
his
country
once
he's
been
returned
to
it,
but
the
alien
is
not
eligible
for
refugee
status
if
before
coming
here,
he
himself
assisted
or
otherwise
participated
in
other
acts
of
prosecution.
the
persecution
must
be
on
account
of
certain
protected
characteristics
such
as
of
raise,
religion,
or
national
origin.
if
the
alien
engaged
in
those
acts,
the
so-called
persecutor
bar
in
the
statute
prevents
him
from
getting
the
refugee
status.
this
alien,
daniel
girmai
negusie,
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case
when
the
petitioner
sought
refugee
status,
he
found
himself
disqualified
by
reason
of
the
persecutor
bar.
he
countered
that
he'd
been
forced
or
coerced
to
assist
in
the
prosecution.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
the
prosecutor
bar
applies
if
an
alien
has
been
forced
or
coerced
in
prosecuting
others.
petitioner
is
a
dual
national
of
eritrea
and
ethiopia.
he
was
conscripted
into
the
eritrea
in
military
in
the
1990s.
when
the
petitioner
refused
to
file
against
ethiopia,
his
other
native,
he
was
incarcerated
and
persecuted
in
eritrea.
the
eritrean
government
then
forced
him
to
work
as
an
armed
guard
in
a
prison
where
individuals
were
persecuted.
the
immigration
judge
found
that
the
petitioner
had
not
shot
at
or
directly
prosecuted
the
inmates,
but
the
petitioner
did
guard
them
at
gunpoint
and
forced
them
to
remain
in
the
hand
sand
which
he
knew
was
a
form
of
persecution.
the
petitioner
escaped
and
fled
to
the
united
states.
here,
he
applied
for
the
refugee
status
in
the
form
of
asylum
and
withholding
of
removal
based
on
the
persecution
he
suffered
in
eritrea.
the
immigration
judge,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
all
concluded
that
the
persecutor
bar
does
apply
even
if
the
petitioner's
assistance
in
persecution
was
coerced
or
otherwise,
the
product
of
duress.
the
petitioner
argues
that
the
statutory
text,
the
structure,
and
the
history
make
clear
that
involuntary
acts
do
not
implicate
the
persecutor
bar
and
the
government
on
the
other
hand
argues
that
congress
explicitly
spoke
to
the
contrary
by
not
including
a
duress
exception.
because
there
is
substance
to
both
contentions,
we
find
that
the
statute
has
an
ambiguity
that
the
agency
should
address
in
the
first
instance.
in
deciding
this
case
and
in
ruling
against
the
petitioner,
the
agency
and
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
a
case
from
this
court.
that
case
was
fedorenko
versus
united
states
decided
in
1981,
but
fedorenko
arose
under
a
different
statute
than
the
one
we
consider
here
and
the
fedorenko's
statute
was
enacted
for
a
different
purpose.
we
now
conclude
it
was
error
to
treat
the
result
or
the
reasoning
fedorenko
is
controlling
the
interpretation
of
the
prosecutor
bar
at
issue
here.
a
review
of
the
agency's
prior
decisions
on
point
reveals
that
the
agency
has
erroneously
felt
itself
bound
by
our
decision
of
fedorenko
and
thus,
believed
it
had
no
discretion
to
exercise.
having
concluded
that
the
agency
has
not
yet
exercised
its
chevron
discretion,
we
see
no
reason
to
depart
from
the
ordinary
remand
rule
that
is
well-established
and
no
administrative
law
precedent.
here,
the
agency
can
bring
in
its
expertise
to
bear
on
the
matter
and
so
doing
it
can
through
informed
discussion
and
analysis
help
a
court
later
determine
whether
the
agency's
interpretation
exceeds
the
leeway
the
law
provides.
we
thus
remand
to
the
agency
for
consideration
of
the
question
in
the
first
instance.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consisted
with
this
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
alito
has
joined.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
