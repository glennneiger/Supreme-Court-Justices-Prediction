justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
what
your
brief
says:
"being
forced
upon
threat
of
death
or
serious
injury
to
participate
in
the
persecutory
acts
of
his
oppressors.
"
justice

if
someone
said,
if
you
don't
--
there
are
500
men,
women
and
children
in
a
shed;
if
you
don't
administer
lethal
gas
to
them,
we
are
going
to
administer
20
lashes,
that
would
be
sufficient
in
your
view?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
not
very
helpful.
how
would
the
balancing
be
struck?
how
would
you
strike
it
there?
justice

let
me
ask
you
--
let
me
ask
you
about
another
practical
consequence
of
your
position.
i
--
i
have
seen
a
lot
of
these
asylum
cases,
and
usually
the
evidence
consists
almost
entirely
of
the
uncorroborated
statement
made
by
the
person
who
is
claiming
asylum.
so
in
your
view
the
immigration
judges
are
going
to
have
to
decide
the
degree
of
the
threat
that
the
asylum
claimant
underwent
and
the
consequences
of
failing
to
comply
with
whatever
he
was
directed
to
do.
and
they
are
going
to
have
to
do
that
based
solely
on
the
credibility
determination
made
about
an
uncorroborated
witness
who's
typically
testifying
through
an
interpreter
and
who
has
all
of
the
mannerisms
and
aspects
of
speech
of
someone
who
comes
from
an
entirely
different
culture.
that's
the
consequences
of
the
position
that
you
are
advocating?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
really
think
that's
true?
they
are
quite
skilled
at
getting
to
the
bottom
of
making--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
how
are
they
made?
how
are
they
made?
i
looked
into
the
person's
eyes
and
they
looked
shifty?
no,
they
have
to
--
they
search
around
for
some
little
contradiction
in
the
testimony.
if
the
--
if
the
ij
has
a
suspicion
that
this
person's
who
testifying
through
an
interpreter
--
what
language
did
the
petitioner
here
speak?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
know.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
many
interpreters
are
there
of
that
language
in
the
united
states
and
what
are
the
quality
of
the
interpreters?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
that
an
apt
analogy?
if
we
looked
at
all
the
duress
cases
that
have
been
decided
since
the
beginning,
are
we
going
to
find
cases
where
someone
said
--
someone
claims
that
i
was
told
i
had
to
kill
25
people,
100
people;
i
had
to
put
people
out
in
the
sun
until
they
died,
because
if
i
didn't
do
that,
i
was
going
to
be
shot?
aren't
the
situations
entirely
different?
