justice
david
h.
souter
it
was
also
the
distinction
about
the
use
of
the
word
"voluntary",
in
which
the
operative
language
which
barred
those
people
didn't
have
"voluntary"
in
it,
and
i
forget
what
it
was,
the
next
textual
section
it
was
there,
so
it
was
reason
to
infer
that
voluntary
activity
was
not
a
criteria
for
the
bar.
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
serious
bodily
harm?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
the
reasoning
here,
mr.
katsas,
it
seems
to
me
implicates
exactly
what
justice
breyer
brings
up.
we
had
a
colloquy
earlier
on
--
on
the
extent
of
the
reliance
by
the
bia
for
its
general
policy
on
fedorenko,
and
what
the
does
a
see
cite
mean
and
so
on.
but
in
--
in
this
particular
case,
going
to
page
6a
or
7a
from
which
mr.
pincus
was
--
was
earlier
quoting,
if
you
look
on
page
7a,
the
reason
that
fedorenko
is
thought
to
be
appropriate
here
is,
he
--
that
is
to
say,
the
petitioner
here
--
has
not
demonstrated
his
conduct
is
distinguishable
from
that
of
the
alien
in
that
case.
the
conduct
of
the
alien
in
that
case
was
identified
as
relevant
by
the
voluntary/involuntary
distinction.
it
was
so
identified
because
of
the
text
of
the
statute,
voluntary
was
used
in
one
place;
it
wasn't
used
in
the
place
where
the
bar
was
set
up.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
by
the
express
reasoning
in
this
case,
this
case
is
governed
by
a
rule
that
in
effect
says
the
distinction
between
voluntary
and
involuntary
action
is
not
a
relevant
distinction.
so
i
don't
think
you
can
get
by
in
this
case
without
confronting
just
what
justice
breyer
says.
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
answer
his
point
in
this
case
without
admitting
that
fedorenko
in
fact
was
--
was
improvidently
relied
upon,
because
it's
not
good
authority
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
is
not
really
consistency
with
fedorenko.
this
--
in
this
case
the
bia
is
saying
that
he
cannot
say
that
his
conduct
in
effect
is
different
from
the
conduct
in
fedorenko.
and
what
was
relevant
about
the
fedorenko
conduct
was
it
did
not
have
to
be
voluntary
conduct.
so
it
is
bringing
--
it
seems
to
me,
the
reasoning
in
this
case
is
relying
upon
a
rule
that
says
that
the
voluntary/involuntary
distinction
is
not
significant.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
answers
justice
breyer's
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
doubt
it,
but
go
ahead.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
one
thing
that
congress
has
not
done
and
it
didn't
do
it
in
this
act,
is
to
make
the
express
voluntary/involuntary
distinction
textually
that
the
dpa
made
in
fedorenko.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reasoning
set
out
in
this
case
says
this
is
exactly
like
the
fedorenko
situation;
that
implies
that
the
same
rule
in
fedorenko
should
apply.
if
the
same
rule
applies,
presumably
it
should
be
on
the
basis
of
a
statute
which
is
identical
on
the
--
on
the
textual
voluntariness
point
to
the
statute
in
fedorenko.
this
one
--
this
one
is
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
don't
have
the
voluntary/involuntary
distinction
here
in
--
or
--
in
textual
treatment
that
you
had
in
--
in
the
dpa
statute
in
fedorenko,
do
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
--
you
don't
follow
that
with
the
section
that
uses
the
word
"voluntary",
whereas
the
bar
does
not
use
the
word
"voluntary",
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--can
you
give
me
a
couple
of
examples
of
the
voluntariness
that
creates
in
effect
the
same
distinction
here
as
under
the
dpa?
justice
david
h.
souter
was
that
passed
as
part
of
the
same
legislation
that
created
the
bar
section
we
are
dealing
with?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
--
i
don't
want
to
split
hairs
here,
but
i
mean
the
voluntary
return
behavior
is
a
behavior
of
the
alien
in
this
country
with
respect
to,
in
effect,
an
election
under
existing
federal
law;
whereas,
the
voluntary/involuntary
distinction
in
the
dpa
was
a
distinction
that
referred
to
the
alien's
conduct
overseas
at
the
relevant
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
have
convinced
me
there
are
contrasts,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
they
are
contrasts
that
raise
the
implication
in
a
clear
way
as
it
was
raised
in
the
dpa.
and
i
think
that's
my
only
disagreement
with
you
at
this
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
do
know
that
aristotle
was
not
construing
this
federal
statute,
don't
you?
[laughter]
