mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
categorical
terms,
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
provides
that
persons
who
assist
or
otherwise
participate
in
persecution
may
not
obtain
certain
immigration
benefits.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
no,
but
the
--
the
mr.
chief
justice,
modifies
the
"persecution".
the
persecution
in
this
case
was
directed--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--i
think
grammatically,
the
immediately
preceding
noun
is
"persecution".
if
the
mr.
chief
justice,
it
seems
to
me
that
would
prove
far
too
much,
in
that
a
prison
guard
who
served
voluntarily,
voluntarily
in
order
to
get
a
paycheck,
wouldn't
be
within
the
bar
because
he
would
--
he
wouldn't
be
assisting
on
account
of--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--right.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
that
the
question
here
--
the
question
here
is
the
availability
of
a
duress
defense.
one
can
--
one
can
order
persecution
under
duress
just
as
one
could
assist
in
persecution
under
duress.
imagine,
for
instance,
the
camp
commandant
at
treblinka
ordering
the
slaughter
of
thousands
of
innocent
people.
he
could
say:
well,
i'm
doing
that
under
duress
because
if
i
don't,
if
i
don't
order
persecution,
someone
up
my
chain
of
command
will
kill
me,
which
is
precisely
what's
wrong
with
petitioner's
theory
here,
its
--
its
unbounded
nature.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
the
attorney
general
does
not
have
discretion
with
respect
to
withholding.
and
remember,
the
persecutor
bar
in
the
asylum
statute
is
identical
to
the
persecutor
bar
in
the
withholding
statute.
but
in
any
event,
this
court
said
in
cases
like
phinpathya
the
fact
that
the
text
goes
to
an
eligibility
requirement
is
not
a
ground
for
the
court
reading
in
limitations
that
aren't
there
on
the
theory
that
the
attorney
general
can
address
something
case
by
case.
that's
because
immigration
is
subject
to
the
plenary
control
of
congress,
and
when
congress
writes
a
rule
and
this
court
converts
it
into
a
standard,
it's
shifting
control
over
the
immigration
laws
from
congress
to
the
executive
and
ultimately
to
the
courts.
it
seems
to
us
that
reasoning
governs
here.
with
respect
to
your
question
about
hard
hypotheticals,
i
don't
dispute
that
there
are
hard,
sympathetic
--
sympathetic
persecutors
on
mr.
pincus'
side
of
the
case,
but
keep
in
mind
what
is
at
stake
here.
persecution
is
not
typically
a
grassroots
phenomenon.
it's
a
--
it's
a
phenomenon
typically
ordered
by
governments
or
rebel
groups
aspiring
to
be
governments.
it's
typically
carried
out
through
coercion.
so
if
petitioners
are
correct,
not
only
the
prison
guard
in
this
case
who
held
a
gun
to
keep
people
out
in
the
sun
until
they
died,
not
only
would
he
have
a
colorable
defense,
but
so
too
would
every
single
guard
at
treblinka.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
but
the
point--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--mr.
chief
justice,
you
are
absolutely
correct
that
there
will,
of
course,
be
hard
cases
about
how
broadly
to
draw
the
circle.
but
in
fedorenko,
this
court
instructed
that
the
way
to
deal
with
that
problem
is
not
by
reading
in
a
--
a
voluntariness
exception
into
a
statute
that
simply
doesn't
contain
it,
but
rather
by--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--of
course,
justice
kennedy,
congress
could
pass
a
statute
with
whatever--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--that's
true
in
the
context
of
criminal
law.
but
think
about
why
it's
true,
justice
kennedy.
it's
true
because
congress
when
it
passes
criminal
statutes
legislates
against
a
background
of
hundreds
of
years
of
common
law
precedent
in
the
criminal
area;
and
this
court
has
said
presumptively
congress
legislates
against
that
common
law
background,
and
that
is
the
theory
for
on
some
occasions
reading
mens
rea
requirements
and
common
law
defenses
like
duress
into
criminal
statutes.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
exactly.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
justice
breyer,
the
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--two
points.
with
respect
--
with
respect
to
involuntary
actions,
this
case
--
this
case
doesn't
present
that
question.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
okay.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
because
the
thousand-year
tradition
that
you
correctly
identify
is
a
criminal
law
tradition.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
justice
breyer,
this
is
a
statute
--
this
is
a
statute
that
allocates
immigration
benefits.
immigration
law
is
a
creature
of
statute.
there
is
no
background
in
common
law--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--the
question
--
with
respect
to
intentional
conduct,
the
conduct
at
issue
here,
justice
breyer,
is
knowing
and
intentional.
so
there
is
no
question
about--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--i
--
i
don't
know
why
it
--
with
respect
to
the
bia's
reasoning,
this
decision
is
a
straightforward
application
of
20
years
of
bia
precedent
concluding
--
consistent
with
fedorenko
that
voluntariness
is
not
relevant
matter.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
right.
that
was
the
construction
--
with
the
construction--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--but
the
--
i
may
be
missing
some
of
the
subtlety
of
your
point.
but
let
me
try--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--let
me
try
it
this
way.
the
--
the
statutory
formulation
that
we
are
discussing
is
the
concept
of
assistance
in
persecution.
fedorenko
in
the
context
of
the
displaced
person's
act
construes
that
provision
to
make
involuntariness
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
many
courts
of
appeals
and
the
bia
repeatedly
over
the
last
20
years
have
held
that
the
reasoning
that
fedorenko
governs
not
only
the
displaced
person's
act,
where
it
is
of
course
directly
controlling,
but
subsequent
statutes,
of
which
there
are
no
fewer
than
seven,
using
essentially
the
identical
formulation
of
assistance
in
persecution:
congress
carries
forward
that
formulation
in
a
canonical
way
statute
after
statute.
if
you
look
to
legislative
history,
you
will
see
that
congress
repeatedly
expresses
an
affirmative
intent
that
all
of
these
persecutor
bar
provisions
be
construed
in
pari
materia
and
against
that
backdrop
we
have
administrative
precedent.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
identical
or
not
textually
distinguishable,
to
the
extent
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--you
--
well,
you
have
the
same
operative
language
of
assisting
persecution.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
except
you
do.
throughout
the
--
throughout
the
ina
are
provisions
that
are
expressly
keyed
to
voluntariness.
so
you
have
the
same
--
the
same
contrast
can
be
made
with
respect
to
the
ina
bars
as
fedorenko
made
with
respect
to
the
dpa
bar.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
and
they--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--sure.
let
me
give
you
one:
the
asylum
--
the
asylum
statute
--
the
substantive
asylum
statute
itself
in
8
u.s.c.
1158
provides--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--yes
and
no.
let
me
explain.
section
1158,
the
substantive
asylum
law,
did
not
have
a
persecutor
bar
as
originally
enacted
by
the
refugee
act
of
1980.
the
persecutor
bar
in
the
substantive
asylum
statute
was
added
in
1996
by
the
iirira
statute,
which
in
the
same
statute,
in
the
same
section,
has
a
provision
that
asylum
can
be
terminated
if
the
alien
voluntarily
decides
to
return
to
his
home.
so
you
have
a
contrast
in
the
same
section
of
the
same
statute.
conduct-based--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--that's
a
fair
point,
justice
souter,
but
to
the
extent
part
of
the
reasoning
in
fedorenko
rests
on
the
--
and
the
inference
from
the
contrast,
those
same
contrasts
are
present
here
where
--
the
point
of
the
example--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--well,
you
have--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--absolutely.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
exactly.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
exactly.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
exactly.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
that's--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--i'm
not
sure.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
i
don't
know
what
aristotle
had
to
say
about
it,
but--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--right.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
statutory
sequence
is
the
word
1977
--
when
congress
changes
"assist"
to
"assists
or
otherwise
participates
in"--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--the
only
consequence
of
that,
if
any,
could
be
a
broadening,
not
a
narrowing.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
mr.
chief
justice,
the
word
"assist"
was
construed
in
fedorenko
not
to
--
not
to
contain
an
implicit
voluntariness
exception.
congress
adds
to
that
the
word
"participate",
which
this
court
in
yeskey
construed
not
to
have
an
implicit
involuntariness--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--either
belt-and-suspenders
or
broadening
the
circle
in
ways
that
are
difficult
to
describe
in
the
abstract.
but
"participate"
--
this
court
has
said
in
reves,
"participate"
is
a
term
of
breadth.
so
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
the
argument
that
by
adding
an
additional
term
of
breadth
to
the
scheme
congress
somehow
narrowed
what
would
otherwise
apply.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
my
answer
is
that
the
analysis
of
that
question
does
not
turn
on
whether
or
not
he
is
compelled
to
build
the
prison
walls;
it
turns
on
footnote
34
of
fedorenko,
which
says
that
courts
will
have
to
draw
difficult
lines
in
distinguishing
between
the
kind
of
aid
that
constitutes
assistance
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
the
kind
of
aid
that
does
not.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
but--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
our
position
is
that
knowledge
is
a
sufficient
mens
rea
and
is
clearly
satisfied
here
where
petitioner,
by
his
own
testimony,
knew
about
the
mistreatment.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
we
have
taken
the
position,
justice
stevens,
in
other
cases,
that
knowledge
is
not
required.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
it's
been
rejected
by
a
few
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
it
is
a
broader
position,
but
happily
for
me,
it
is
not
the
position
before
the
court
today,
particularly
----
[laughter]
--particularly
in
light
of
fedorenko,
justice
scalia,
which
puts
a
gloss
on
voluntariness,
but
does
not
address--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--the
question
--
i'm
not
sure
the
distinction.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
or
intent.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
or
intent,
justice
stevens.
the
conduct
here
is
intentional.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
duress
exception
to
it.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
intent
to
perform
the
acts
that
constitute--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--they
were
not
the
same
thing,
even
in
the
criminal--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--right.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
we
don't
read
--
our
position
is
it's
not
fair
to
--
it's
not
fair
to
incorporate
the
full
common
law
background
criminal
concepts,
including
that
of
duress.
the
question
by
justice
breyer
whether
assistance
in
persecution
contains
an
implicit
duress
limitation
seems
to
me
very
different
from
the
question
whether
it
contains
an
implied
knowledge
limitation.
and
the
latter
question
is
not
present
here
with
respect
to
a
prison
guard
who,
by
his
own
admission,
knew
exactly
what
was
going
on
and
deliberately
implemented
torture
by
keeping
people
in
the
sun,
exposed
in
the
sun
to
the
point
of
death.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
mr.
chief
justice,
they
certainly
get
discretion
in
conducting
the
analysis
of
what
constitutes
assistance.
but
fedorenko
said
that
that
--
that
inquiry
is
independent
of
any
question
of
duress
on
--
it
said
that
the
inquiry
should
happen
case-by-case,
that's
fine;
but
it
gave
--
the
footnote
in
fedorenko
gave
us
two
clear
data
points
to
help
frame
the
analysis.
one
is
the
conduct
of
a
woman
who
does
nothing
more
than
cut
the
hair
of
people
bound
for
execution.
court
said,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
cannot
constitute
assistance.
the
other
data
point
is
the
case
of
an
armed
prison
guard
who,
perimeter
guard
who
keeps
people
in
a
camp;
and
the
court
said,
of
course,
that
constitutes
assistance.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
i
would
not
say
that.
i
think
fedorenko--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--i
think
fedorenko
--
fedorenko
says
that
the
--
the
level
and
degree
and
character
of
assistance
of
the
woman
simply
cutting
the
hair
does
not
constitute
assistance.
at
the
other
continuum
of
conduct,
fedorenko
says
that
the
conduct
of
an
armed
prison
guard
does
constitute
assistance,
even
if,
as
in
fedorenko,
the
guard
served
under
duress.
and
justice
stevens,
if
i
could
come
back
to
the
facts
of
fedorenko,
the
district
court
in
that
case
found
that
if
fedorenko
did
not
serve
at
the
prison
guard
--
at
the
prison
camp,
he
would
have
been
executed.
that
finding
was
not
reversed
either
by
the
fifth
circuit
or
by
this
court,
which
held
that
duress
was
not
relevant
to
the
inquiry
of
assistance.
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
petitioner--
mr.
gregory
g.
katsas
--justice
ginsburg,
it's
true
that
the
displaced
persons
act
was
limited
to
the
nazi
regime,
and
later
statutes,
the
refugee
act
generalizes
in
the
sense
of
eliminating
the
time
and
place
restrictions
on
the
definition
of
refugee.
on
the
specific
question
of
the
persecutor
bar,
congress
carries
forward
the
same
language
with
an
affirmative
indication
of
intent
to
preserve
the
concept.
with
respect
to
your
point
about
the
nazis
being
singularly
horrific
in
human
history,
think
of
how
that
feature
plays
out
under
petitioner's
theory.
under
petitioner's
theory,
the
uniquely
horrific
nature
of
the
nazi
regime
gives
rise
to
a
dramatically
expanded
class
of
people
who
can
credibly
raise
a
duress
defense
on
anyone
under
--
anyone
under
adolf
hitler
in
the
organization
chart
of
the
nazi
government
could
credibly
say,
if
i
didn't
kill
jews,
i
would
be
killed
myself.
the
executive
permissibly
rejected
that
construction
of
things
in
--
in
construing
the
persecutor
bar
at
issue
here.
