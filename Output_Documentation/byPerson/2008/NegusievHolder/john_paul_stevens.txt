mr.
pincus,
refresh
my
recollection
about
something
about
the
fedorenko
case,
which
i
should
have
reread,
but
i
honestly
didn't
in
detail.
am
i
not
correct
that
the
point
that
justice
alito
makes
was
really
part
of
the
background
of
the
case
there
was
that
nobody
really
believed
his
testimony?
it
was
assumed,
for
purposes
of
decision,
that
he
was
telling
the
truth,
but
it
was
pretty
clear
he
was
not.
whereas
here
everybody
does
assume,
for
purposes
of
decision,
that
this
man
is
telling
the
truth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
answer
to
the
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
voluntariness
is
the
purpose
the
statute.
what
is
the
difference
between
intent
and
knowledge,
in
terms
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute?
why
is
intent
different
--
lack
of
intent
any
different
from
lack
of
knowledge?
if
you
read
this
statute
literally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that,
do
you
not,
that
with
a
case
involving
lack
of
knowledge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
pardon?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
an
intent
to
persecute
or
an
intent
to
perform
certain
acts
that
constitute
persecution?
