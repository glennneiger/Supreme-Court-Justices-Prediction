justice

bader

why
shouldn't
the
starting
point
be
what
this
court
decided
in
the
fedorenko
case?
the
wording
of
this
provision
is
very
close
to
the
wording
of
that
statute,
much
closer
than
the
un
covenant
that
you
have
referred
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
be
--
what
would
be
the
minimum.
you
say
the
statute
is
clear.
it
requires
some
culpability,
how
would
you
verbalize
what
is
the
lowest
standard
that
the
attorney
general
could
impose
to
read
statute
to
infuse
in
it
some
element
of
culpability?

mr.

justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
--
what
about
the
position
that
the
displaced
person's
act
was
special
to
the
holocaust?
i
mean,
we
are
dealing
with
people
who
said
we
were
just
following
orders,
and
we
did
not
want
to
grant
those
people
asylum.
now
in
this
post-world
war
ii
effort,
we
are
engaged
in
an
enterprise
where
other
countries
in
the
world
--
and
should
we
look
to
see
how
they
are
interpreting
this
notion
of
duress,
coercion?
are
they
considering
it
irrelevant;
would
just
look
to
see
if
the
person
in
fact
was
providing
some
material
assistance
to
persecution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
mean
they
were
made
all
the
time?
