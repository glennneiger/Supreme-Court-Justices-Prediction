mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
father
forced
at
gunpoint
to
engage
in
incest
with
his
daughter
because
of
his
religion,
race,
or
political
views,
and
told
that
he
and
his
daughter
will
be
killed
if
he
refuses,
is
far
outside
the
class
of
persons
brought
to
mind
by
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
phrase
at
issue
in
this
case,
which
is
reprinted
on
page
1
of
our
brief,
quoting
from
section
(a)
42):
"any
person
who
ordered,
incited,
assisted,
or
otherwise
participated
in
the
persecution
of
any
person.
"
on
account
of
a
prohibited
factor.
the
same
is
true
if
--
of
someone
who,
as
part
of
the
religious
persecution
directed
against
him,
is
forced
on
threat
of
death
to
disrupt
a
prayer
meeting
and
injure
his
co-religionists.
the
father
and
the
co-religionists
are
victims
of
persecution.
they
would
not
be
described
in
ordinary
parlance
as
"persecutors".
and
we
think
that
that
really
is
dispositive
of
the
question
of
this
case
under
the
government's
view,
the
persecutor
bar
turns
solely
on
what
they
term
"objective
effect
of
an
individual's
acts.
"
but
that
means
that
the
act
need
not
be
accompanied
by
any
of
the
indicia
of
moral
offensiveness
that
the
law
typically
requires,
even
if
the
individual
acted
under
duress,
under
threat
of
death,
even
if
the
individual
did
not
know
that
his
conduct
related
to
persecution,
and
even
if
the
individual.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
think
under
chevron
that,
one,
the
first
question
is
is
there
a
gap
to
be
filled
here?
the
language--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
yes.
we
think
chevron
supplies
the
framework.
the
first
question
is,
is
there
ambiguity.
we
would
--
we
argue
that
here
and
our
principal
submission
is
that
there
is
no
ambiguity
here
and
that
there
is
therefore
no
occasion
for
deference.
if
the
court
were
to
disagree
with
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
our
submission,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
phrase
here,
using
the
principle
that
the
court
applied
in
watson
and
looking
at
the
phrase
and
looking
at
the
picture
that
it
brings
to
mind,
would
never
bring
to
mind
the
examples
that
i
cited
as
conduct
that
would
be
captured
by
this
provision.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
there
are
cases--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
your
honor,
there
are
cases,
some
of
which
that
determination
has
been
reversed
by
a
court
of
appeals.
but
the
bia
has
taken
the
position
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
--
well,
we
pointed
out
that
that
is
the
position
that
the
bia
has
taken
and
the
government
has
not
disavowed
it.
so
i
don't
know
whether
they're--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
your
honor.
but
there
certainly
have
been
a
number
of
decisions
along
that
line,
including
one,
for
example,
where
an
individual
was
told,
you
know,
"stand
here".
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
you
could,
your
honor,
although
the
underlying
--
the
government's
underlying
theory
for
all
three
of
its
positions,
both
that
coercion
doesn't
matter,
that
knowledge
doesn't
matter,
and
that
subjective
intent
doesn't
matter,
is
its
view
that
these
words
require
only
objective
acts.
once
you've
determined
that
the
words
require
something
more--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
two
responses,
your
honor.
certainly
in
the
criminal
context,
duress
is
a
well-recognized
defense
and
this
court
has
said
that
in
dixon
and
other
cases.
but
i
just
want
to
be
clear
that
the
knowledge
that
we
are
talking
about
here
that
the
government
has
disavowed
is
not
knowledge
that
you
engaged
in
an
act.
they
don't
--
they
don't
take
the
position
that
sleepwalking
is
--
can
be
a
persecutive
act.
but
their
view
is
even
if
you
don't
know
that
your
act
is
contributing
to
persecution
--
you're
kept
in
the
dark
by
the
actual
persecutors;
they
just
ask
you
to
do
something
that
in
fact
is
contributing
to
persecution
--
they
say
that
doesn't
matter,
and
that
it
all
rests
on
what
we
think
is
their
wrong-headed
construction
of
the
statute.
i
just
want
to
return
to--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
no,
your
honor.
i
mean,
obviously--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
and
our
position
is
that
that's
a
logical
starting
point.
there
is
of
course
a
body
of
law
that's
been
developed
in
the
criminal
context
about
the
parameters
about
the
defense
of
duress
and
that
would
be
a
pretty
logical
starting
point,
we
think.
the
attorney
general
would
have
discretion,
once
the
court
corrected
the
view
that
the
statute
doesn't
--
that
coercion
is
irrelevant,
just
to,
within
the
limits
of
chevron,
define
what
the
coercion
test
is.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
under
some
--
under
some
conceptions
of
this
defense,
there
is
a
balancing
test
between
the
threat
that
is
directed
against
the
individual
and
the
threat
--
and
what
the
injury
that
he
is
asked
to
carry
out.
that
could
be
part
of
the
test.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
what
the
courts
have
said
in
the
criminal
context
is
that
there
are
three
criteria:
an
immediate
threat
of
death
or
serious
bodily
injury;
a
well-grounded
fear
that
it
will
be
carried
out;
and
no
reasonable
opportunity
to
escape.
that's
the
general
standard.
so
in
the
criminal
context--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--it
might
be
appropriate--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
some
courts
have
said
that
murder
is
a
different
kettle
of
fish
and
that
there
is
a
question
unanswered
in
the
federal
system
about
whether
or
not
there
is
a
direct
defense
for
murder.
the
states
are
divided.
the
model
penal
code
has
said
yes,
there
should
be.
that
is
one
of
the
issues
that
would
be
open
for
the
attorney
general
to
the
extent
he
wishes
to
exercise
his
discretion
to
decide.
what's
clear,
though,
is,
we
think,
the
rule
--
the
current
construction
of
the
statute
is
not
right.
there
is
a
body
of
law
out
there
that
is
well
developed
in
the
criminal
context
that
could
be
a
very
logical
starting
point.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
two
responses
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
language
in
fedorenko,
the
text
was
very
context-specific
and
it
shows
that.
the
language
that
applied
there
specifically
referred
to
the
enemy
and
specifically
referred
to
persecution
of
civilians,
making
it
quite
clear
that
that
was
a
statute
that
was
targeted
in
the
specific
world
war
ii
context,
which
was
all
that
it
applied
to.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
exactly,
your
honor,
and
the
court
said
the
deliberate
omission
--
it
specifically
looked
at
the
fact
that
these
sections
were
adopted
at
the
same
time,
followed
on
each
other
immediately,
and
one
had
"voluntary",
and
then
it
said
this
was
a
deliberate
omission
and
we
conclude
that
that
deliberate
omission
provides
the
basis
for
interpreting
the
language--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--exactly,
your
honor.
i
was
going
to
get
to
the
second
part
of
your
chevron
question
and
respond
just
that.
if
the
court
were
to
conclude,
contrary
to
our
submission,
that
the
language
here
is
ambiguous
and
there's
a
gap
to
fill,
our
position
is
--
and
we
think
it's
quite
well
borne
out
by
the
decisions
--
that
the
bia's
decisions
here
rested
on
the
mistaken
assumption
that
fedorenko
bound
it
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
rodriguez-majano
was
the
first
one.
the
issue
was
not
even
raised
in
that
case.
it
was
dicta
in
the
paragraph
before
citing
fedorenko.
in
fact,
the
bia
says:
"the
service
agreed
at
oral
argument
that
the
actions
don't
constitute
participation
and
persecution.
"
so
there
really
wasn't
an
issue
there.
but
all
that's
there
is
a
sentence
and
a
reliance
on
fedorenko,
seems
pretty
clear
that
that
decision
just
mistakenly
believed
fedorenko
controlled
the
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
there
are
--
there
are
two
different
questions
here,
justice
scalia.
if
the--
bia
purported
to
--
if
the
--
if
the
bia
said
there
is
a
gap
to
fill
here,
we
are
going
to
exercise
our
expertise
and
discretion
and
decide
that,
that
would
be
one
situation.
we
think
it's
quite
clear
here
that
the
bia
believed
erroneously
that
fedorenko
compelled
the
result,
that
it
thought
this
was
a
chevron
step
one
case,
and
it
was
merely
reciting
what
it
believed
to
be
the
rule
and
saying
that
fedorenko
controls.
so
we
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
text
that
we
are
relying
on
is
--
is
the
actual
decision,
which
just
makes
a
flat
statement,
again
in
dicta:
"the
participation
or"
--
i
am
reading
from
rodriguez-majano.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
you
don't.
it's
a
decision
of
the
bia.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
actually
the
language
is
on
page
27
of
our
yellow
brief.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
at
the
very
top
of
the
page.
so
all
that
there
is
there
is
a
recitation
of
the
rule
and
a
citation
to
fedorenko.
and
our
submission
is--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
it
is
certainly--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
well,
first
of
all,
as
i
say--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
statement
in
this
decision
is
dicta.
here
i'm
not
sure
whether
they
consulted
the
bluebook
before
they
picked
the
"see"
cite,
but
--
but
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
all
we
have
here
is
a
legal
rule
and
a
legal
rule
that
generally
has
been
perceived
to
be
the
rule
that
--
that
was
announced
by
fedorenko,
not
tied
in
any
way
to
the
different
statutory
language
at
issue
in
this
case
or
anything
else.
let
me
--
let
me
also
turn
to
the
second
decision
that
is
relied
on,
which
is
the
decision
in
this
case.
and
there
--
and
i
am
looking
at
--
at
page
6a
of
the
petition.
and
the
bia
says,
citing
to
--
to
its
prior
decision
in
matter
of
fedorenko,
it
--
it
recites
this
rule.
now--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--it's
another
"see"
cite.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
which
they
indicate
because
they
are
actually
directly
--
well,
anyway.
the
matter
of
fedorenko,
that's
a
case
--
and
i
apologize.
in
our
brief
we
said
that
was
the
case
that
relied
on
the
dpa.
that's
actually
a
case
that
involved
the
holtzman
amendment,
again
not
the
statute
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
therefore
just
sort
of
reflexively
taking
a
rule
in
a
different
case
and
applying
it
to
this
very
different
statute
without
any
analysis.
and
not
to
get
into
too
much
of
a
train
of
bia
logic,
but
i
think
it
is
important.
the
second
case
cited
here,
matter
of
laipenieks,
which
is
the
actually
the
--
the
precedent
that
matter
of
fedorenko
relies
on,
again
specifically
called
out
the
language
of
fedorenko
and
says,
as
in
fedorenko
--
and
i
am
quoting
from
page
464
of
that
decision
--
as
in
fedorenko,
the
plain
language
mandates
the
result.
so
here
in
--
in
all
of
the
bia
analysis,
there
is
no
analysis
in
terms
of
exercising
expertise
and
discretion.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
apologize.
it's
in
a
different
bia
decision.
it's
in
the
matter
of
laipenieks
decision
at
page
464.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
that
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i'm
betting
on
"see".
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
exactly,
your
honor.
and
that's
why
in
--
my
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question
is
that
if
the
court
were
to
disagree
with
us
and
conclude,
contrary
to
our
submission
that
the
language
is
ambiguous,
then
we
don't
have
an
exercise
of
agency
discretion
under
step
one
or
step
two,
because
all
the
agency
decisions
rest
on
the
belief
that
the
statutory
language
forecloses
that
--
the
--
the.
exercise
of
that
discretion.
so
in
that
event
we
submit
the
appropriate
result
would
be
to
remand
the
case,
but--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--he
gets
to
stay
here--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
or
if
--
if
he
were
to
--
he
gets
to
stay
here
as
long
as
sending
him
back
would
not
involve
torture.
so
the
protection
is
narrower
than
the
protection
that
generally
would
be
available
in
two
senses:
first
of
all,
it
only
applies
to
torture.
if
you
were
sent
back
and
you
were
going
to
be
imprisoned
for
life
for
your
--
for
the
acts
that
are
protected--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
cat
would
not
protect
you.
and
cat
also
does
not
protect
you
against
non-state
actions.
so
especially
in
the
world
today,
where
a
lot
of
the
bad
things
that
happen
in
other
countries
are
by
rebels
and
non-state
actors,
the
convention
against
torture
would
not
provide
protection
in
that
situation.
so
it's
broader
protection
for
a
broader
--
for
a
somewhat
broader
group
of
people.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
your
honor,
just
--
just
as
in
the
initial
question
about
whether
someone
has
been
subject
to
persecution
in
the
first
place,
that's
--
that
is
the
process
that
we
have.
and
immigration
judges
are
quite
skilled
in
getting
to
the
bottom
of
what's
going
on.
they
also
have,
in
addition
--
and
as
relied
on
in
this
case--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
their
job.
i
think
they
also
have
the
country
reports
that
the
state
department
prepares,
and
they
were
relied
on
in
this
case.
if
--
if,
for
example,
someone
were
to
come
in
and
say,
i
am
a
victim
of
coercion,
and
the
country
report
does
not
provide
any
indication
that
that
is
happening
in
the
country,
that's
obviously
a
reason
to
look
quite
skeptically--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--but
they
typically
come
from
a
country
where
there
is
persecution,
and
they
could
easily
have
been
subjected
to
it,
or
they
could
also
just
as
easily
have
read
about
it
or
heard
about
it
in
--
along
their
way
here.
you
think
that's
an
easy
determination?
if
--
but
--
well,
but
it's
true
of
the
initial
claim
of
persecution.
but
if
--
if
the
refugee,
an
asylum
applicant,
comes
and
says,
i
have
been
subject
to
persecution,
and
there
is
no
issue
of
coercion
in
the
case,
that
is
--
the
concern
that
you
have
identified
arises
there.
if
a
case-specific,
the
case-specific
decision
has
to
be
made,
this
is
an
additional
question
that
will
have
to
be
answered.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
and
--
and
we
also
think
it's
significant
in
this
respect,
that
the
secretary
of
homeland
security
has
in
connection
with
a
different
disability,
the
material
support
disability,
said
that,
promulgated
an
exclusion
for
--
in
some
circumstances
for
people
who
are
coerced
to
provide
material
support.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
breyer.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
my
answer
was
in
the
absence
of
action
by
the
attorney
general.
but
i
think
you
are
absolutely
right
that
the
important
thing
to
point
out
here
is,
as
with
the
standard
itself,
the
attorney
general
could
in
the
asylum
context
decide
that
in
certain
kinds
of
situations
that
this
coercion
is
not
relevant.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
i
think
that's
--
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
and
part
of
what
was
going
on
there
was
the
sheer
--
two
things:
the
sheer
administrative
burden
of
millions
of
refugees
and
the
need
to
process
them
in
some
kind
of
expeditious
fashion;
and
the
fact
that
it
was
known
that
there
was
sort
of
an
organized
effort
by
people
who
had
been
participating,
especially
in
the
concentration
camps,
to
come
up
with
this
defense.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
the
attorney
general
has
rulemaking
authority
in
the
asylum
area,
certainly.
and
we
think
even
in
--
even
with
respect--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
we
think
the
question
now
before
the
court
is,
is
there
no
coercion
defense?
that's
the
--
that's
the
government's
position
--
flatly,
totally
irrelevant.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
it
--
it
--
it
seems
to
me
it
could
well
--
i
mean,
obviously,
that
would
be
a
question
that
would
come
up,
but
--
but
given
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
think
once
there
is
a
coercion
defense,
it
would
be
fleshed
out
in
the
administrative
process.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
absolutely.
well,
we--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--we
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
and
i
apologize
if
i
suggested
to
the
contrary.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
because
the
statutory
context
here
was
to
implement
our
treaty
obligations,
and
the
treaty
obligations
refers
--
refer
to
criminal
conduct
--
we
think
the
logical
starting
point
that
--
that
you
are
asking
about,
justice
ginsburg,
would
be
the
criminal
law
standards,
which,
as
i
say,
are
well
developed
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes,
it's
a
--
it's
a
three-part
test:
threat
of
serious
bodily
harm;
no
reasonable
well-grounded
fear
that
it
will
be
carried
out;
and
no
reasonable
way
to
avoid
it.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
applicant
would
have
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
yes.
credibility
determinations
are
made
all
the
time.
and
there
is
some
--
i
mean
here,
the
applicant--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i'm
not
--
not
english.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
don't
know,
but
not
english.
there
was
an
interpreter
at
the
hearing.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
but
these
are
--
i
mean--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--do
the
interpreters?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
they
may,
your
honor.
but
that
--
that's
a
problem
--
we
already
have
a
system
where
we
were
deciding
whether
someone
is
persecuted
and
all
these
issues
arise.
we
are
already
looking
very
specifically
at
all
the
facts.
the
same
facts
--
the
same
factual
development
would
be
relevant
to
the
coercion
issue.
as
i
said,
the
applicant
will
bear
the
burden
of
proof.
and
here,
the
--
as
in
other
cases,
the
country
reports
are
often
relied
on
and
are
revealing
as
to
whether
what
the
situation
is,
what
the
specific
context
is,
makes
sense.
if
i
could
turn
to
the
criminal
law
question
that
justice
scalia
asked.
i
think
the
criminal
law
background
is
very
relevant
here
as
well,
because
the
treaty
that
this
statute
was
enacted
to
implement
our
obligations
with
respect
to,
right
--
referred
specifically
to
crimes.
the
exclusion
that
was
--
that
is
authorized
by
the
treaty
says,
and
i
am
quoting
from
an
excerpt
on
page
11
of
our
reply
brief:
"has
committed
a
crime
against
people
--
a
war
crime
or
a
crime
against
humanity.
"
that
therefore
makes
very
relevant
this
body
of
law
that
has
been
developed
in
the
criminal--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
think
you
are
combining
two
questions,
your
honor.
one
--
one
is
should
this
language
be
interpreted
to
have
a
coercive
--
to
require
uncoerced
conduct
in
order
to
label
someone
a
persecutor.
we
think
this
is
very
relevant
in
deciding
that
question,
because
the
underlying
treaty
that
was
implemented
specifically
referred
to
crimes,
and
crimes
generally
have
that
--
that
--
crimes
don't
--
a
criminal
liability
doesn't
apply
to
someone
who
acts
if
they
are
coerced.
whether
the
precise
standards
that
have
been
developed
in
the
federal
criminal
context
control
in
all
situations
here,
i
think
that
is
something
that
may
not
be
clear.
as
i
suggested,
the
attorney
general
may
have
discretion
to
flesh
out,
and
the
board
may,
what
is
coercion
in
this
context;
and
there
is
a
debate
as
i
said
before,
about
whether
intentional
murder,
especially
the
intentional
murder
of
a
group
of
people,
is
--
is
an
act
for
which
coercion
is
--
a
coercion
defense
is
ever
available.
but
those
are
issues
that
--
that
don't
take
away
from
the
fact
that
here
the
government's
position
is
there
is
coercion
is
totally
irrelevant.
if
i
could
just
--
one
other
issue,
the
voluntariness
provisions
in
the
statute
that
my
colleague
raised
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question,
those
provisions
were
enacted
subsequently.
the
1980
refugee
act
adopted
the
language
that's
at
issue
here.
may
i
finish
my
answer?
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i'm
sorry.
may
i
finish
my--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--my
thought.
the
language
at
issue
here,
those
came
later
in
the
re-enactment
of
that
language
in
another
context.
