chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-581,
14
penn
plaza
llc
v.
pyett.
mr.
salvatore.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
so
i'm
clear--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
wouldn't
be
unilaterally
imposing,
right?
you
would
say
if
you're
going
to
work
for
me,
you've
got
to
arbitrate,
and
that
could
be
negotiated,
theoretically,
with
individual
employee.
and
--
i
mean,
the
whole
point,
the
whole
benefit
of
collective
bargaining
is
that
that
doesn't
happen.
you
say,
well,
the
employer
has
a
lot
of
leverage
if
he
wants
to
insist
upon
that,
but
it
would
not
--
it
would
be
a
matter
for
negotiation
between
the
individual
and
the
company.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
kind
of
conflict
always
present
whenever
you
have
collective
action?
i
mean,
you
may
be
a
particularly
good
worker
and
could
demand
a
higher
wage
than
the
union
has
negotiated,
but
you're
still
bound
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
happens
in
every
situation
where
you
have
collective
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
don't
have
to
be
vindicated
in
particular
ways.
the
individuals
can
agree
to
arbitrate
these
claims,
and
they
would
be
--
the
arbitration
would
be
binding.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
may
go
the
other
way.
they
may
say:
look,
we
don't
like
to
arbitrate.
in
fact,
the
arbitration
is
a
great
benefit
to
workers
because
it's
very
expensive
to
bring
these
claims,
even
with
the
prospect
of
recovering
fees.
most
of
them
like
the
idea
that
the
union
is
going
to
stand
up
for
them
and
take
it
to
management,
but
they
could
say:
look,
we
don't
want
it.
if
--
if
you
are
discriminated
against,
you
know,
sue
us.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
under
my
scenario,
the
employer
wouldn't
have
to
pay
for
arbitration.
there
would
be
--
there
would
be
no
arbitration
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
there
is
no
arbitration.
the
employer
says:
look,
i
don't
think
i
discriminate.
i've
got
a
good
record.
i'm
not
going
to
agree
to
arbitrate
claims.
i'm
going
to
make
people
go
to
court
because
there
will
be
fewer
claims
brought.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
mean,
my
point
is
that
there
are
benefits
to
employees
from
arbitration
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
employer
may
not
agree
to
it.
if
he
doesn't
have
any
protection,
if
it
doesn't
buy
him
anything,
if
employees
can
still
go
to
court,
what's
the
--
what's
the
point?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
gannon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
--
you
focus
on
the
fact
that
congress
has
given
an
individual
right,
but
for
the
many
matters
that
you
say
are
the
subject
of
collective
bargaining,
you
don't
need
a
statute.
i
don't
need
a
statute
to
negotiate
with
someone
whether
i
get
paid
$20
an
hour
or
$15
an
hour
for
a
particular
job.
and,
yet,
that
is
something
that
you
give
up
when
you
join
the
union,
and
you
are
subject
to
collective
bargaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
isn't
it
--
why
isn't
it
the
same
with
these
statutory
rights?
why
aren't
they
subject
to
collective
bargaining
as
well?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
am
--
the
forum
--
the
forum
for
asserting
the
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
would
any
employer
want
to
agree
to
arbitration
under
this
system?
he
gets
nothing
from
it.
you
said
you
get
to
--
to
arbitrate
except
when
you
don't
arbitrate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
just
begs
the
question
that
your
interpretation
of
gardner-denver
is
correct.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
position
--
so
your
position
is
going
to
hurt
most
employees,
because
assuming
that
the
employer
wants
to
arbitrate,
the
union
gets
something
in
return
for
agreeing
to
that.
i
don't
know
what
it
is,
another
50
cents
an
hour,
if
you
agree
to
arbitrate
all
these
claims.
well,
you
don't
get
that
anymore,
because
an
employer
is
not
going
to
agree
to
arbitrate
if
it
--
if
the
employees
don't
have
to
arbitrate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
employees
have
no
--
no
leverage.
i
mean,
if
the
--
if
the
employer
wants
to
say,
look,
if
you
want
to
work
here,
you've
got
to
arbitrate
--
i
mean,
the
employees
don't
have
bargaining
leverage.
that's
the
whole
reason
you
have
a
union.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
salvatore,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-581,
14
penn
plaza
versus
pyett.
