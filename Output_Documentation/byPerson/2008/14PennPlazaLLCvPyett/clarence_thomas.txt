justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
respondents
are
members
of
the
service
employees
international
union
who
worked
for
petitioner
temco
service
industries
as
night
lobby
watchmen
and
in
similar
capacities
in
a
building
owned
and
operated
by
petitioner
14
penn
plaza.
14
penn
plaza
is
a
member
of
the
realty
advisory
board
on
labor
relations,
a
multiemployer
bargaining
association
for
the
new
york
city
real
estate
industry.
the
union
and
the
board
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
i'll
refer
to
that
as
a
cba
that
requires
union
members
to
submit
all
claims
of
employment
discrimination
to
binding
arbitration.
14
penn
plaza,
with
the
union's
consent
engaged
a
contractor
affiliated
with
temco
to
provide
licensed
security
guards
for
the
building
causing
temco
to
reassign
respondents
to
jobs
as
porters
and
cleaners.
contending
at
least
reassignments
violated
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
of
1967,
adea,
respondents
through
the
union
requested
arbitration
under
the
cba.
after
the
initial
hearing,
however,
the
union
withdrew
the
age
discrimination
claims
on
the
grounds
that
its
consent
to
the
new
security
contract
precluded
it
from
objecting
to
respondent's
reassignments
as
discriminatory.
respondents
then
filed
a
complaint
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
which
issued
them
a
right
to
sue
notice.
in
the
ensuing
lawsuit,
petitioners
filed
a
motion
to
compel
the
arbitration
of
respondents'
age
discrimination
claims
in
accordance
with
the
cba.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
and
the
second
circuit
affirmed
holding
that
this
court's
decision
in
alexander-gardner-denver
company
forbids
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
provisions
that
require
arbitration
of
adea
claims.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
a
provision
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
clearly
and
unmistakably
requires
union
members
to
arbitrate
adea
claims
is
enforceable
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
the
union
and
the
board
collectively
bargained
in
good
faith
and
agreed
that
employment-related
discrimination
claims
including
adea
claims
would
be
resolved
in
arbitration.
this
freely
negotiated
contractual
term
easily
qualifies
as
a
condition
of
employment
subject
to
mandatory
bargaining
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
thus
the
cba's
arbitration
provision
must
be
honored
unless
the
adea
itself
requires
this
arbitration,
this
particular
class
of
grievances
from
the
--
whether
the
adea
itself
removes
--
i'm
sorry,
the
--
this
particular
class
of
grievances
from
the
nlra's
broad
sweep.
it
does
not.
this
court
squarely
held
in
gilmer
versus
interstate/johnson
lane
corporation
that
the
adea
does
not
preclude
arbitration
of
federal
age
discrimination
claims.
the
cba's
arbitration
provision
is
also
fully
enforceable
under
the
gardner-denver
line
of
cases.
the
facts
underlying
gardner-denver
and
its
progeny
revealed
the
narrow
scope
of
the
legal
rule
they
engendered.
as
the
court
explained
in
gilmore,
these
cases
“did
not
involve
the
issue
of
the
enforceability
of
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
statutory
claims,”
but
“the
quite
different
issue
whether
the
arbitration
of
contract-based
claims
precluded
subsequent
judicial
resolution
of
statutory
claims.”
gardner-denver
does
not
control
the
outcome
whereas
here,
the
cba's
arbitration
provision
expressly
covers
both
statutory
and
contractual
discrimination
claims.
even
though
the
gardner-denver
line
of
cases
included
broad
dicta
highly
critical
of
using
arbitration
to
vindicate
statutory
antidiscrimination
rights,
that
skepticism
rested
on
a
misconceived
view
of
arbitration
that
this
court
has
since
abandoned.
finally,
this
court
is
not
positioned
to
resolve
the
first
--
in
the
first
instance
respondent's
claims
that
the
cba
allows
a
union
to
prevent
them
from
effectively
vindicating
their
federal
statutory
rights
in
the
arbitral
form.
this
question
would
require
resolution
of
contested
factual
allegations.
it
was
not
fully
briefed
here
or
below,
and
it
is
not
fairly
encompassed
within
the
question
presented.
we
therefore
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
judgment.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
souter
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined.
