i
don't
--
i
don't
wish
to
delay
your
reading,
but
--
but
as
--
as
part
of
the
decision
we
have
to
make,
don't
we
have
to
have
in
the
background
the
consideration
of
the
--
that
the
potentiality
that
the
union
might
do
just
what
it
did
here,
and
that
would
help,
it
seems
to
me,
inform
our
decision
on
the
question
that
you
are
presenting.
now,
whether
or
not
it's
properly
raised
here,
i
do
agree
with
you
it
comes
rather
late.
but
isn't
it
a
factor
that
we
must
necessarily
consider?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
--
that
means
that
--
and
if
there's
a
totally
frivolous
claim
and
the
employer
--
pardon
me,
the
union
says
we
are
not
going
to
arbitrate,
the
--
the
employee
still
has
the
right
to
then
proceed?
the
employer
hasn't
gotten
very
much.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
would
--
if
you
would
answer
the
question.
the
employer
hasn't
gotten
very
----
[laughter]
--very
much
for
the
bargain.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
hard
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
hasn't
got
the
ability
to
have
the
union
help
them
weed
out
frivolous
claims.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
that
employers
nationwide
would
--
would
--
would
accept
--
would
accept
that
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
again,
maybe
that's
--
that's
a
reason
for
us
not
to
reach
it
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
employer
did
have
the
practice
that
the
chief
justice
suggested,
it
tells
each
employee
you
have
to
sign
an
arbitration
form,
could
the
union
in
its
collective
bargaining
negotiations
say
that
you
will
withdraw
this
form
and
that
you
shall
not
impose
this
obligation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
your
view.
if
a
case
came
up
to
it,
how
would
that
be
decided--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
i'm
concerned
it's
the
same
thing
the
chief
justice
mentioned.
i
just
don't
think
the
employer
is
going
to
get
very
much
under
this
interpretation.
and
that
may,
ultimately,
hurt
the
employee.
