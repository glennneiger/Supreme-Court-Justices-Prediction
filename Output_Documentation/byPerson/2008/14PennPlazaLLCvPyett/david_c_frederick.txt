mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
second
circuit's
judgment
should
be
affirmed
for
three
reasons.
first,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
gives
the
union
exclusive
control
over
workers'
grievances.
second,
unions
have
inherent
conflicts
of
interest
with
respect
to
individual
statutory
antidiscrimination
rights;
and
third,
unions
lack
authority
to
serve
as
gatekeepers
of
individual
workers'
substantive
adea
rights.
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
generally
gives
the
union
exclusive
control
over
whether
to
bring
grievances
on
behalf
of
workers
and
how
such
grievances
are
pursued.
in
such
circumstances,
which
is
this
case,
the
worker
does
not
evince
the
requisite
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
control
over
the
arbitral
forum
to
satisfy
this
court's
standards
in
gilmer
for
effectively
vindicating
the
worker's
statutory
antidiscrimination
rights.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
alito,
i've
looked
comprehensively
through
the
cases.
we've
never
found
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
gives
the
kind
of
interpretation
that
mr.
salvatore
offered
in
this
case.
now,
is
it
theoretically
possible
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
confer
on
individuals
the
rights
this
court
said
in
gilmer
are
necessary
to
effectively
vindicate
that?
i
would
acknowledge
it's
theoretically
possible,
but
it
has
to
be
done
within
the
confines
of
whether
there
is
actual
consent
by
the
individual
to
the
arbitration,
whether
the
individual
has
control
over
the
mechanisms
of
arbitration,
and
whether
or
not
the
structure
of
the
arbitral
forum
effectively
vindicates
the
individual's
substantive
rights.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
nothing
except
this
court's
case
in
magnavox,
where
the
court
said
that
the
union
may
not
bargain
away
an
individual's
rights
where
there
would
be
a
conflict
between
the
union's
interests
and
the
individual's.
here,
because
this
is
a
discrimination
claim,
unions
are
often
brought
as
defendants
in
such
claims,
particularly
in
circumstances
as
here,
where
the
union
agreed
to
the
conditions
that
gave
rise
to
the
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age
by
these
workers.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
that's
why
i
think
the
gilmer
point
is
--
is
essential
here,
justice
souter
and
justice
alito.
because
in
gilmer
there
was
individual
consent;
there
needs
to
be
such
individual
consent
under
the
adea
waiver
provision
itself,
and
knowing
and
individual
waiver
is
necessary
before
the
person
can
waive
the
substantive
adea
rights.
that
would
need
to
be
part
of
the
hypothetical
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
i
was
positing
with
justice
alito.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
that
would
follow,
as
that
be
--
would
be
a
condition
of
employment
that
could
not
be
imposed.
the
air
line--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
there
are
two
different
points
at
which
the
condition
of
employment
arose.
i
understood
the
questions
on
this
side
to
be
after
the
agreement
had
taken
place
and
the
worker
was
already
on
the
work
site.
under
your
hypothetical,
if
an
employee
gains
entrance
to
the
workforce
and
is
asked,
"will
you
sign
this",
there
is
individual
consent
in
that
circumstance.
that
is
the
fact
situation
in
the
air
line
pilots
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
--
that's
how
we
read
this
court's
cases--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--sorry.
with
an
ordinary--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
i
think
that
those
category
of
cases
do
stand
in
a
different
position
because
there
is
less
of
an
inherent
conflict
of
interest.
the
union
there--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
the
union
is
not
going
to
be
the
defendant
typically
in
a
tort
case
where
the
employer
is
responsible.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
refers
to
discrimination,
and,
as
we
cite
on
page
27
of
our
brief,
there
are
provisions
in
the
antidiscrimination
laws
that
are
specifically
directed
at
union
discrimination.
the
legislative
history
of
these
statutes
indicates
that
discrimination
by
unions
was
one
of
the
concerns
animating
congress--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
in
fact--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
that's
why--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
think,
justice
breyer,
that
the
discrimination
cases
do
stand
in
a
different
category
because
of
the
inherent
conflict
of
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
don't
think
congress--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
no,
because
there
are
two
other
reasons:
the
exclusive
control
over
the
machinery
and
the
union
serving
as
the
gatekeeper.
i'm
not
aware
of
tort
suits
being
subjects
of
collective
bargaining,
justice
breyer.
nor
am
i
aware
of
cases
in
which
the
unions
have
given
up
individuals'
tort
claims
in
situations,
principally
because
unions
are
not
the
persons
against
whom
such
tort
suits
are
brought.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
you
would,
but
the
principles
this
court
has
applied
in
looking
at
that
broad
line
--
i'm
trying
to
suggest
that
there
might
be
situations
in
which
those
principles,
where
the
union
is
serving
as
the
gatekeeper,
thereby
not
allowing
a
person
to
vindicate
his
individual
rights
in
the
tort
context,
to
be
not--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
the
answer
is
no.
i
thought--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
your
question
really
is
getting
at
the
theory
behind
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
what
extent
the
union
can
exercise
control
over
the
individual
rights
and
circumstances
of
employment.
that
question
is
a
very
complex
question
over
which
many,
many--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
--
well,
i
think
that
there
are
limits,
of
course,
on
the
union's
authority
that
have
been
recognized
in
this
court's
decisions,
and
i
don't
think
that
ruling
in
the
workers'
favor
in
this
circumstance
opens
up
any
kind
of
pandora's
box
at
all,
because
all
we
are
arguing
for
is
that
the
gardner-denver
line,
which
was
written
by
this
court
unanimously
more
30
years
ago,
continue
to
be
the
law
of
the
land,
as
the
court
has
reaffirmed
it
in
cases
like--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
--
i
think
that
is
a
harder
case,
justice
alito,
but
i
think
that
the
answer
under
this
court's
decisions
in
gardner-denver
points
the
way
here,
in
footnote
19
of
the
decision.
where
the
union
controls
that
process
and
where
the
union
is
a
potential
defendant
in
that
circumstance,
the
workers'
individual
rights
cannot
be
subordinated--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--to
the
union's
control.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
and
i
think
that
there
have
been
conditions
of
employment
and
discharge
that
have
been
arbitrable,
and
i
don't
see
that
there
is
a
--
an
issue
there
where
--
except
where
that
intersection
with
the
statutory
discrimination
rights
occurs.
and
congress
has
made
a
different
policy
judgment
with
respect
to
individual
waivers
of
such
rights
in
having
those--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
i'm
not
sure
actually
in
answering
your
hypothetical
that
they
would
necessarily
have
to
go
through
the
union
on
the
nonpayment
because
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
case.
this
court
in
barrentine
said
that,
where
an
flsa
claim
is
at
issue,
the
worker
does
not
--
is
not
confined
or
precluded
after
arbitrating
at
the
union
grievance
process
from
bringing
an
flsa
suit
in
court.
so
i
want
to
reserve,
accepting
all
of
your
hypothetical,
justice
scalia,
but
in
further
answer
to
the
point,
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
in
the
discrimination
context,
you're
talking
about
more
than
just
money.
here
my
clients
are
older
workers
who
are
forced
into
more
physically
strenuous
positions
that
they
had
gotten
away
from
by
virtue
of
their
growth
in
seniority
at
the
building.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
certainly,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
where
congress
has
made
a
choice
that
individual
claims
for
antidiscrimination
rights
need
to
be
vindicated
in
particular
ways,
and
where
this
court's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--certainly,
but
there
is
individual
consent
in
that
circumstance.
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
other
points
before
closing.
one
is
that
on
pages
4
to
5
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
cert
we
specifically
raise
the
issue
that
the
union
controls
the
arbitration,
and
there
is
no
opportunity
for
individual
arbitration
under
this
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
is
nothing
in
the
provision
set
out
in
the
petition
appendix
that
gives
individual
rights
the
--
individuals
the
right
to
arbitrate
under
this
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
payment
provision
calls
for
50
percent
by
the
employer
and
50
percent
by
the
employee
with
the
employer
having
the
sole
right
to
terminate
the
arbitrator
for
any
or
no
reason
at
all.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--certainly,
the
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
fairly
included
within
the
question
presented.
and
as
this
court
found
in
wright
in
a
situation
where
it
granted
certiorari
on
the
very
same
question
here
but
then
looked
at
the
specific
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
determine
that,
in
fact,
under
the
facts
there
a
different
rule
applied
for
a
clear
and
unambiguous
waiver.
all
we
are
saying
here
is
that
under
this
provision
there
is
no
opportunity
for
the
individual
to
arbitrate,
and
that
raises
a
--
a
problem
analogous
to
the
one
that
is
in
wright.
we
think
that
is
fairly
included
within
the
question
presented
and
that
the
court
can
affirm
on
that
basis.
certainly
where
the
second
circuit
had
relied
on
precedent
that
said
that
where
the
individual
doesn't
have
a
right,
that
it
is
union
control
of
arbitration,
that
is
consistent
with
gardner-denver.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--my
only
point
is
that
this
is
one
of
those
fuzzy
areas
where
we
are
not
making
an
independent,
alternate
ground
of
affirmance.
i
think
our
argument
is
fairly
included
within
the
question
presented
and
can
be
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
that
argument.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
guess
i'd
answer
that
question
by
saying,
we
will
pay
our
money
and
take
our
chances
in
the
sense
that
the
unions
here
are
supporting
the
workers
where
the
unions
are
acknowledging
that
there
is
this
kind
of
conflict
of
interest.
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
imposing
arbitration
on
individual
workers
would
be
a
condition
of
employment,
that
is
a
question
that
you
can
safely
leave
for
another
day.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
mr.
chief
justice,
in
fact,
empirically
that's
not
correct.
there
is
a
study
that
is
cited
in
a
footnote
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
arbitration
is
more
expensive
than
bringing
civil
litigation.
and
it's
because
the
--
under
--
under
their
provision
if
you
pay
50
percent
of
the
arbitrator's
costs,
you
can
run
up
quite
a
big
tab
that
you
would
not
have
to
pay--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
under
your
scenario,
i
think
where
the
employer
would
control
the
arbitral
process,
the
arbitrator
knows
who
is
buttering
his
bread.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
--
and
that
has
been
the
law
for
30
years,
and
we
think
it
should
continue
to
be
the
law,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
marketplace
is
going
to
help
weed
out
those
claims,
that's
certainly
the
province
of
lawyers
taking
these
cases
and
clients
deciding
whether
or
not
to
take
it
to
litigation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
certainly--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--but
that's
why
this
court
has
always
said
that
individual
consent
and
agreement
is
a
fundamental
precept
of
arbitration,
and
where
that
agreement
is
absent,
a
worker
should
not
be
forced
to
that
route.
thank
you.
