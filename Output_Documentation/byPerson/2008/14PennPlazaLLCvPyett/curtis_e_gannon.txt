mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents'
fundamental
right
to
a
workplace
free
of
invidious,
class-based
discrimination
is
something
their
union
had
no
power
to
barter
away
in
collective
bargaining,
and
the
union--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yes,
justice
breyer.
this
court's
cases
have
not
yet
described
a
specific
line,
and--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
think
that
the
--
the
best
line
that
we
have
is
--
is
stated
in
both
gardner-denver
and
barrentine
as
contrasting
statutory
rights
that
are
related
to
collective
activity,
and
especially
economic
activity,
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
are
normally
delegated
to
the
union.
those
are
the
sorts
of
things
that
the
union
can
actually
engage
in
collective
bargaining
about.
and
when
the
union
negotiates
the
underlying
right,
then
it
makes
perfect
sense
that
the
labor
arbitration
framework
that's
set
forth
here
would
continue
to
resolve
disputes
that
are
arising
under
--
out
of
that
specific
right.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
because--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
--
i
think,
justice
scalia--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--but
i
think
what's
important,
justice
scalia,
is
--
is,
though
--
is
the
line
that
the
court
stated
in
barrentine:
that
if
a
statute
is
designed
to
give
specific,
minimum
protections
to
individual
workers,
then
that's
the
sort
of
thing
that
the
union
doesn't
have
the
power
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
over.
and
so
your
salary
may
well
be
something
that
the
union
can
normally
bargain
about.
but
if
you
want
to
assert
that
the
--
that
the
employer
or
the
union
--
because
both
are
the
types
--
the
types
of
entities
that
can
be
charged
with
discrimination
under
title
vii
or
the
ada
or
these
other
statutes
--
the
reason
that
they
gave
you
a
lower
salary
was
on
the
basis
of
something
for
which
you
had
a
federal
statutory
protection,
then
--
then
you
have
an
independent
statutory
right
that
the
union's
majoritarian
decisionmaking
processes
should
not
be
in
the
process
of
controlling.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
yes.
and
the
difference
is
that
the
union
is
making
the
decision
about
where
the
claim
will
be
vindicated.
and
in
this
case
in
particular,
the
union
is
going
to
control
whether
the
claim
will
actually
be
able
to
be
officially
vindicated.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
--
even
the
employer
here
is
not
claiming
that
the
underlying
statutory
right
is
subject
to
collective
bargaining.
they
are
just
saying--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
in
this
instance
congress
gave
individual
employees
the
right
to
bring
a
civil
action
in
a
judicial
forum
as
a
means
of
enforcing
their
antidiscrimination
claims.
and
although
arbitration
may
always
provide
an
alternative
forum
to
that,
this
court
has
repeatedly
made
clear
that
arbitration
is
always
a
matter
of
contract.
and
it
does
not
impose
on
the
employer
any
more
than
on
the
employee
a
requirement
that
they
arbitrate
a
claim
when
they--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
with
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
that's
true.
since
1974,
this
has
been
the
law
of
the
land,
and
it
is
been
even
after
gilmer
in
every
circuit
except
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
it
--
it
is
the
prevailing
interpretation
in
every
circuit
that
has
considered
the
question
since
gilmer
except
the
fourth
circuit.
and
if
you
look
at
the
empirical
data
that's
mentioned
in
some
of
amicus
briefs,
including
in
particular
the
amicus
brief
of
the
national
academy
of
arbitrators,
it
is
true
that
even
when
there
is
just
a
labor
arbitration
machinery
that
was
invalid
under
the
terms
of
gardner-denver
and
would
not
be
binding
on
the
employee
if
the
employee
happens
to
lose
in
that
arbitration,
in
most
of
those
cases
when
the
employee
loses
that
arbitration,
he
does
not
go
on
to
file
an
independent
case--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
we
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
why
the
employees
will
not
be
able
to
make
agreements
with
the
employers,
as
was
made
possible
in
gilmer.
and
so
that
the
point
is
that
it
just
can't
be
a
vicarious
agreement
to
arbitration
on
behalf
of
the--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
mean,
there
was
an
argument
in
gilmer
that
they
didn't
have
leverage,
either.
and
the
court
stressed
that
as
long
as
the
employee
has
actually
agreed
to
it,
that
--
and
--
and
as
long
as
the
arbitral
forum
is
going
to
be
adequate
to
provide
for
effective
vindication
of
the
underlying
statutory
rights,
then
--
then
the
arbitral
forum
would
be
adequate--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
that's
--
as
mr.
frederick
mentioned
and
is
as
discussed
in
several
of
the
briefs,
that's
an
undecided
question
of
labor
law.
the
national
labor
relations
board--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--we
think
that
as
long
as
the
employees
have
been
--
have
been
able
to
indicate
exactly
the
same
level
of
individual
agreement
that
was
upheld
in
gilmer
and
that
the
arbitral
forum
itself
is
going
to
be
adequate,
that
that
takes
care
of
that
half
of
the
question.
the
national
labor
relations
board,
which
has
--
which
would
be
entitled
to
deference
on
this
question
and
which
has
never
spoken
to
the
labor
law
question
of
what
role
the
unions
might
be
able
to
play
in
helping
facilitate
the
agreements
negotiated
between
the
employers
and
the
individual
employees,
it
could
come
out
in
at
least
three
different
ways.
one
of
them
is
the
arrangement
outlined
in
the
alpa
d.c.
circuit
decision
that
--
that
petitioners
rely
upon.
but,
of
course,
that's
an
instance
where
there
were
two
completely
separate
agreements.
the
employment
arbitration
was
agreed
to
by
the
employees
before
they
are
even
represented
by
the
union.
it
was
at
the
outset
of
the
establishment
of
the
employment
relationship,
which
mr.
frederick
discusses.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
not
necessarily,
justice
souter,
because
there
are
all
sorts
of
other
attributes
of
the
arbitral
forum
that
might
--
might
well
be
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
sufficient
to
effectively
vindicate
the
underlying
substantive
rights.
in
gilmer
itself,
the
court
specifically
considered
whether
the
employee,
mr.
gilmer,
would
have
an
opportunity
to
play
a
role
in
selecting
the
arbitrator.
in
this
instance,
even
under
petitioner's
view
of
the
cba,
which
we
don't
think
is
supported
by
the
text
of
the
cba,
this
--
these
employees
are
still
stuck
with
an
arbitrator
who
has
been
chosen
by
the
employer
and
by
the
union.
and
those
are
the
two
entities
that
have
already
decided
that
their
claim
is
meritless.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
if
the
variables
are--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--we
think
that
there
needs
to
be
individual
agreement
in
order
to
comply
with
gilmer
because
of
the
underlying
inherent
tension
between
the
collective
interests
of
the
union
and
the
individual
interests
of
the
employees,
especially
in
antidiscrimination
statutes.
