justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
included
in
the
question
presented
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
the
way
the
second
circuit
resolved
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
second
circuit
simply
said
you
could
not
deprive
an
individual
of
the
right
to
a
court
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
issue
is
whether--
justice
antonin
scalia
--now,
if
--
if
we
held
that
you
can
require
the
individual
to
go
to
arbitration,
in
some
later
case
we
could
confront
the
question
of
whether,
if
the
union
is
in
exclusive
control
of
the
arbitration
and
the
--
the
individual
will
not
get
a
fair
arbitrated
deal,
that
would
invalidate
it.
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
presented:
is
an
arbitration
clause
which
clearly
and
unmistakably
waives
the
union
member's
right
to
a
judicial
forum
enforceable?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
--
i
hate
to
get
into
this,
you
know,
nine
years'
history
of
dealings
between
the
union
and
--
and
the
employees.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
mean?
does
that
mean
that
they
must
go
to
arbitration
even
if
the
union
decides
that,
you
know,
this
claim
is
--
is
so
insignificant
we
don't
want
to
take
it
to
arbitration?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
salvatore,
i
--
i
didn't
think
we
took
this
case
to
--
to
determine
the
specific
meaning
as
to
this
issue
of
this
--
of
this
particular
contract,
which
is
not
an
issue
of
national
importance.
why
--
why
must
we
decide
the
case
here?
could
we
not
simply
decide
that
the
second
circuit
was
either
correct,
in
which
case
the
case
would
be
over,
or
incorrect
to
say
that
you
--
that
you
--
you
cannot
--
you
cannot
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
have
the
union
responsible
for
arbitration
of
title
vii
claims?
why
couldn't
we
just
decide
that?
and
then
if
there
is
any
issue
of
whether
such
concession
to
the
union
deprives
an
individual
of
even
the
right
to
arbitration,
that
can
--
that
can
be
decided
on
remand
by
the
second
circuit,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
second
circuit
could
look
into
all
of
these
details.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
inquire
into
the
new
york
law
that
you're
talking
about
now
and
that
i
don't
recall
being
in
any
of
the
briefing.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
salvatore,
would
you
--
would
you
object
to
or
oppose
a
ruling
that
said
--
that
says
yes,
the
--
the
right
can
be
subjected
to
union
arbitration,
but
if
the
union
chooses
not
to
arbitrate
it,
the
individual
must
have
the
right
to
arbitrate
it
on
his
own?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
got
an
arbitration
instead
of
a
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
has
it?
i
mean,
let's
assume
that
my
gripe
with
my
employer
is
that
he
hasn't
paid
me
my
salary
for
the
last
two
months.
now,
you
can't
take
away
my
right
to
that
unless
i
voluntarily
waived
it.
what
is
sacrosanct
about
the
fact
that
my
grievance
here
has
some
discrimination
attached
to
it?
your
briefing
talks
as
though
it
is
something
totally
apart
from
a
mere
economic
right.
ninety-nine
percent
of
the
time,
you're
talking
about
economics.
"i
was
fired
because
of
discrimination.
"
"i
wasn't
promoted
because
of
discrimination,
and
therefore
i
lost
this
--
this
amount
of
money
or
that
amount
of
money.
"
why
is
it
unthinkable
that
the
--
that
the
employee
would
have
to
go
through
the
union-prescribed
arbitration
for
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
paid
for
the
last
three
months
but
does
not
have
to
do
it
for
an
economic
injury
that
occurs
because
of
discrimination?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
did
raise
that
issue,
but
you
didn't
say
that
the
consequence
of
that
issue
was
that
you
win.
you
said
the
consequence
of
the
fact
that
that
issue
was
involved
in
this
case
was
a
good
reason
not
to
--
for
us
to
accept
cert.
and
we
didn't
take
your
advice
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
a
totally
different
issue
whether
because
of
that
question
you
--
you
should
--
you
should
win
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
have
to
be
within
the
question
presented.
you
--
you
can
sustain
the
judgment
below
on
any
ground.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
question
is
whether
we
will
--
we
will
agree
that
we
should
inquire
into
new
ground.
that's
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
doesn't
this
come
within
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
many
of
these
cases,
if
not
most
of
them,
come
within
that?
the
union
negotiates
the
salaries
for
various
levels,
and
then
the
person
says:
i
should
be
at
this
level.
the
only
reason
i
didn't
get
it
was
that
i
was
discriminated
against.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
call
it
a
non-economic
--
phooey,
it's
an
economic
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
taking
away
the
right.
the
--
the
union
is
not
taking
away
the
right.
it's
just
saying
to
vindicate
it,
you
have
to
go
through
arbitration
instead
of
to
the
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
article
vii,
no?
article
vii?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
article
vi.
isn't
it
article
vii,
if
it's
on
47a?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
got
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
that
appear?
