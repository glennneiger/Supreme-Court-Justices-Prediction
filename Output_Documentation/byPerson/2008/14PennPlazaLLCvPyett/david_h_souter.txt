justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
salvatore,
you
take
the
position
that
the
only
thing
that
is
at
stake
here
is
simply,
in
effect,
the
selection
of
the
arbitral
forum.
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that,
in
fact,
the
--
under
--
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
employee
is
subject
not
merely
to
the
right
of
the
union
to
choose
the
arbitral
forum,
but,
in
fact,
to
--
to
assert
any
claim
at
all?
what
--
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
what
--
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
there
is
at
least
some.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
in
here.
and
if
we
are
deciding
anything
at
all,
we
are
going
to
decide
whether
in
this
case
the
--
the
second
circuit
was
correct.
the
question
is
posed
in
generality,
but
we
are
not
going
to
decide
the
general
question
in
total
ignorance
of
this
case.
and
in
this
case,
we've
got
the
particular
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
front
of
us,
and
you
started
to
answer
the
question
that
--
that
i
and
justice
ginsburg
posed
by
referring
to
the
"no
discrimination"
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
will
--
will
you
go
on
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
where
did
we
get
this
phrase
--
where
do
we
get
the
language
"or
the
union
will
turn
over
to
them?
"
the
only
thing
that
i
can
see
in
here
that
addresses
that
is
on
page
46a.
and
the
--
the
clause
there
reads:
"all
union
claims
are
brought
by
the
union
alone,
and
no
individual
shall
have
the
right
to
compromise
or
settle
any
claim
without
the
written
permission
of
the
union.
"
there
is
--
there's
a
lot
of
gray
area
in
that,
but
the
one
thing
that
seems
clear
is
that
the
union
has
total
control
of
any
claim,
including
an
arbitration
claim.
and
that
seems
to
lend
some
substance
to
the
--
to
the
point
made
by
the
other
side
that
if
we
accept
your
position
here,
we
are
accepting
a
position
not
nearly
--
that
the
designation
--
a
procedural
designation
of
a
forum
should
be
enforced
but
that,
in
fact,
total
control
over
the
assertion
of
a
statutory
federal
right
is
also
being
ceded.
now,
why
doesn't
that
language
from
section
46
support
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
it
says
"all
such
claims".
"such
claims"
refers
among
other
things
to
the
statutory
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
the
statutory
right
is
the
appropriate
section
of
an
arbitration
agreement
and
the
union
has
ultimate
control
of
the
arbitration
agreement,
then
it
follows
that
the
union
has
got
ultimate
control
over
the
assertion
of
the
statutory
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
where
--
where
is
the
guarantee
that
the
--
if
the
union
says,
we
don't
want
to
touch
this,
as
in
this
case,
that
the
employee
has
the
right
either
to
arbitrate
or,
for
that
matter,
to
sue?
where
do
you
find
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
even
in
a
case
in
which
you
don't
have
--
let's
assume
--
just
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
we
don't
have
the
discrimination
issue
or
the
conflict
issue.
i
understood
you
elsewhere
to
be
arguing
that
there
had
to
be
the
kind
of
knowing,
intelligent,
and
individual
waiver,
which
i
would
suppose
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
will
never
include.
so
i
thought
it
was
the
--
ultimately
the
implication
of
your
argument
that
in
any
--
in
any
case
in
which
arbitration
is
claimed,
there
would
have
to
be
--
or
a
right
to
go
to
arbitration
is
claimed
by
the
employer
--
there
would
have
to
be,
not
merely
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
a
specific
waiver
by
the
employee
to
--
to
go
ahead
and
do
that.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
one
thing
that's
uniform
throughout
in
your
answer
is
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
alone
can
never
subject
the
employee
to
--
to
mandatory
arbitration?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
those
--
i'm
sorry.
those
examples
are
examples.
you're
getting
down
to
individual
cases.
i
thought
you
drew
the
global
line
in
answer
--
which
would
answer
justice
breyer's
question
by
saying
the
--
in
the
cases
that
we're
talking
about
here,
congress
has
passed
a
statute
giving
a
specific
individual
right
and
that
individual
right
cannot
in
effect
be
compromised
except
in
--
except
in
violation
of
that
statute,
and
that's
where
we
draw
the
global
line.
so
that
when
you
got
to
torts,
you'd
look
at
the
individual
situation
rather
than
draw
a
categorical
line.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
agree
with
you,
but
i
think
--
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
justice
breyer's
mouth--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
i
thought
what
he
was
getting
at
is,
if
i
hold
for
you
here,
am
i
going
to
have
to
hold
for
you
in
every
case
in
which
somebody
has
in
effect
a
tort
claim
which
is
subject
to
an
arbitration
clause?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
it
boil
down
--
doesn't
your
argument
really
boil
down
to
this:
that
the
only
case
in
which
it's
really
going
to
matter
is
the
case
in
which
the
arbitration
agreement
contains
a
clause
that
gives
the
union
plenary
authority
over
the
disposition
of
the
claim?
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
if
--
if
this
is
outside
the
subject
of
mandatory
bargaining,
then
the
employer
can
impose
it;
in
effect,
as
a
matter
of
individual
contract.
if
it's
within
the
subject
of
mandatory
bargaining
but
it's
not
effective
unless
the
employee
also
signs
at
the
time
of
the
incident
or
at
the
time
he
is
hired
an
individual
waiver,
then,
in
fact,
the
only
case
in
which
it's
going
to
make
any
difference
as
to
whether
you
win
or
he
wins
is
the
case
in
which
the
agreement
has
got
a
clause
in
there
that
gives
the
union
plenary
authority
to
dispose
of
the
claim.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
written
down
somewhere?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
didn't
turn
it
over,
did
they,
until
the
action
had
been
brought
in
the
federal
court?
i
mean,
they
didn't
--
maybe
i'm
wrong
in
this,
but
i
didn't
think
that
on
day
one
they
--
they
said,
oh,
well,
because
the
union
doesn't
want
to
proceed
with
this,
you're
welcome
to
chug
ahead
by
yourself.
