justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
has
any
court
decided
this
issue
of
the
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
this
particular?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
under
your
first
point,
are
you
saying
it's
impossible
for
there
to
be
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
reads
the
way
mr.
salvatore
reads
this
collective
bargaining
agreement;
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
says
that
the
union
--
that
the
grievance
must
be
arbitrated,
and
it
will
be
done
either
by
the
union,
or
if
the
union
declines
to
pursue
it,
by
the
individual
employee?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
there
is
nothing
in
federal
labor
law
that
would
preclude
the
negotiation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
like
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
that
mean--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--would
that
mean
that
the
employer
could
not
unilaterally
impose
an
arbitration
requirement
on
employees?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
requires
the
arbitration
of
discrimination
claims
that
are
not
based
on
federal
law?
maybe
they
are
based
on
--
they
are
based
on
state
law
that
goes
further
than
federal
law,
or
maybe
they
are
based
on
a
type
of
discrimination
that's
prohibited
by
neither
federal
nor
state
law.
maybe
it's
discrimination
against
young
people
under
40.
could
those
be
--
those
would
still
be
discrimination
claims
with
the
same
potential
for
--
with
a
potential
for
a
conflict
of
interest.
could
they
be
subjected
to
mandatory
arbitration?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you're
just
using
more
variables
to
justice
souter's
question.
if
those
variables
are
satisfied,
what's
--
what
is
your
answer
to
his
question?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you're
saying
that
this
might
be
--
this
might
not
be
true
and
that
may
not
be
true,
but
suppose
all
of
those
other
requirements
are
satisfied?
