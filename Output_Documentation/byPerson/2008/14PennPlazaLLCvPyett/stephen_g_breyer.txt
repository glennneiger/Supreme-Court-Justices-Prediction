justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
ask
you
--
let
me
ask
you
a
naive
question
possibly
or
may
--
may
reflect
a
misunderstanding.
but
my
understanding
is
that
suppose
you
are
--
you
are
an
employee.
you
believe
your
employer
discriminated
against
you,
say,
on
gender
grounds.
you
have
to
go
to
the
eeoc.
now,
the
eeoc
looks
into
it,
and
very
often
what
they
do
is
they
don't
really
resolve
it.
they
just
give
you
a
letter
that
gives
you
a
right
to
sue.
so
here
congress
was
so
worried
about
this
kind
of
thing
that
they
said
our
specialized
agency,
you
know,
won't
be
the
bottom
line.
people
will
go
there
and
then
they
have
a
right
to
sue
later.
now,
that's
how
congress
felt
about
this
particular
statute.
why
would
they
want
the
union
to
be
the
bottom
line
when,
in
fact,
the
employee
himself
hasn't
agreed?
i
mean,
the
employee
might
agree
in
the
first
place.
he
might
say
i'm
going
to
take
that
letter,
i'm
not
going
to
bring
my
suit.
that's
up
to
him
or
her.
but
here
the
employee
wants
to
bring
her
suit,
just
like
the
eeoc
letter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
that's
my
point,
is
that
the
statute
as
a
whole
reflects
a
considerable
effort
not
to
let
this
employee
get
cut
off
at
the
pass,
and
an
employee
who
is
reasonably
determined
to
get
to
court
probably
can
do
it.
it's
not
definite.
the
eeoc
doesn't
have
to
give
them
a
letter
giving
them
a
right
to
sue,
but
probably
can
do
it.
and
if
that's
a
situation
where
you
have
this
whole
expert
thing
cut
in,
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
parallel
here
that
congress
then
wouldn't
want
the
union
and
the
employer
together
to
be
able
to
cut
that
right
to
sue
off,
at
least
not
very
easily.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
also
true
--
is
that
also
true
with
an
ordinary
tort
suit
or
any
other
kind
of
suit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
tort
suit.
it
says,
some
--
the
union
--
the
same
thing
here,
but
we
are
not
concerned
with
discrimination;
we
are
concerned
with
workplace
safety.
somebody
is
hurt
as
a
result
of
a
machine
improperly
functioning,
or
there
isn't
adequate
notice
or
so
forth.
is
your
view
the
same
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't
this
allow
discrimination
--
doesn't
this
refer
to
discrimination
by
the
employer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
say
section
30
--
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
union
discrimination
particularly;
it
just
talks
about
discrimination.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
so
you're
saying
sometimes
unions
do
discriminate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
sometimes
unions
also
would
rather
have
the
more
effective
machine
or
sometimes
unions
feel
that
their
workers
are
stupid
not
to
read
the
machine
label
properly
or
--
i
mean,
i
can
replicate
anything
you
--
i
think.
we
can
think
of
tort
suits,
the
two
of
us,
which
could
put
unions
and
employees
on
opposite
shores,
just
as
we
can
think
of
discrimination
suits.
most
unions
don't
want
discrimination.
i
mean,
most
of
the
time.
and
most
unions
don't
want
dangerous
machines
most
of
the
time.
so
if
i
decide
for
you
in
this
case,
am
i
also
saying
that
they
can't
arbitrate
ordinary
tort
suits
or
contract
suits
or
just
whether
or
not
the
workplace
which
is
made
of
wood
is
filled
with
termites?
i
mean,
you
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
the
only
reason?
because,
in
other
words,
if
i
think
i
see
no
more
reason
why
a
union
today,
whatever
was
true
40
years
ago
--
that
i
see
no
more
reason
today
why
a
union
would
like
discrimination
than
i
can
see
a
reason
why
they
would
like
a
dangerous
machine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
think
that,
then
i
should
decide
against
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
very
helpful
of
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
replicate
my
question
because
what
i'm
thinking
is
simply
that
there
are
thousands,
maybe
tens
of
thousands,
kinds
of
claims
that
people
go
to
arbitration
over.
and
what
i'm
wondering
here
is
if
you
win
here,
what
is
the
set
of
such
claims
that
i
have
now
said
that
a
union,
through
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
can
force
the
employee
against
his
will
to
go
to
arbitration
over?
i
don't
have
a
feeling
for
that
from
the
briefs.
i
don't
have
a
feeling
that
you
want
to
say
that
discrimination
claims
are
special
in
that
regard,
that
there's
no
line
in
that
regard,
or
that
there's
some
other
line.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
can
you
give
me
a
hint
as
to
the
principle?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
at
some
point
you'd
answer
this
question,
if
you
can:
i
--
i
--
the
issue
in
front
of
us,
as
i
see
it,
is
just
what
you
said:
when
can
a
union
require
the
worker
to
accept
arbitration
rather
than
a
court
case
in
an
instance
where
the
union
member
has
not
signed
a
special
waiver?
that's
the
question,
right?
okay.
and
what
i
think
some
of
us
were
struggling
for
here
is:
if
we
say
yes
to
you
they
can
force
them,
or
no
to
you
they
can't,
what's
the
principle?
now,
the
easiest
kind
of
case
where
you
tend
to
think
they
can
force
the
worker
into
arbitration
is
where
the
right
grows
out
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
period.
then
we
have
what
we
were
talking
about
with
justice
souter,
a
common
law
tort
claim.
then
we
might
have
a
state
law
giving
a
claim.
then
we
might
have
a
federal
law
like
this
one
giving
a
claim.
and
we
just
heard,
as
soon
as
justice
scalia
thought
of
such
a
case,
then
the
response
was,
which
was
the
flsa:
oh,
well,
maybe
we
can't,
you
know,
force
the
worker
to
give
that
one
up
either.
so
what
is
the
line
here
that
we
are
drawing
with
this
case?
is
it
a
line
that
says
discrimination
laws,
federal,
are
special?
federal
laws
are
special?
state
laws
are
special?
common
law
is
special?
collective
bargaining,
too?
what
is
the
principle?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i
am
asking
you
for
the
principle.
[laughter]
