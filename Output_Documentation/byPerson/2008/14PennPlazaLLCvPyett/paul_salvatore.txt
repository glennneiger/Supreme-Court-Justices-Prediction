mr.
paul
salvatore
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
reasons
why
this
court
should
reverse
the
second
circuit's
blanket
ban
on
collectively
bargained,
arbitral
forum
--
forum
selection
clauses.
first,
the
second
circuit
ignored
section
9(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
by
which
congress
empowered
unions
to
bargain
on
behalf
of
their
employees
over
anything
germane
to
the
working
environment,
including
methods
of
workplace
dispute
resolution.
the
forum
in
which
an
adea
claim
is
heard
falls
squarely
in
that
authority.
indeed,
forbidding
unions
from
bargaining
about
the
procedural
right
to
an
arbitral
forum
will
carve
a
judicial
exception
into
the
labor
law
permitting
employers
to
bypass
the
union
and
deal
directly
with
their
employees,
defeating
congress's
national
labor
policy.
second,
the
second
circuit
failed
to
consider
congress's
strong
endorsement
of
workplace
arbitration
contained
in
both
the
faa
and
section
301.
third,
the
second
circuit
erroneously
and
exclusively
relied
on
alexander
versus
gardner-denver.
gardner-denver
is
a
case
about
claim
preclusion,
not
about
enforcing
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
a
statutory
claim.
mr.
paul
salvatore
your
honor,
in
--
in
our
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
here,
the
--
the
union
--
the
employee
tenders
the
claim
to
the
union.
and
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
--
the
employee
and
the
union's
interests
will
be
aligned,
and
the--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--no,
your
honor.
the
--
the
clause
requires
all
claims
to
be
arbitrated,
and
"all
claims"
means
that
the
individuals
then
have
to
go
to
arbitration
with
their
private
counsel
in
this
case
and
--
and
have
their
claims
heard
in
the
arbitral
forum.
so
that
no
one
is
denying--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--your
honor,
i'm
looking
at
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
paul
salvatore
no,
your
honor.
that's
--
that's
not
the
--
the
way
the
contract
reads.
i'm
looking
at
the
petition
appendix
page
48a,
which
is
the
"no
discrimination"
clause.
and
just
--
just
as
a
quick
prelude
to
--
before
i
--
i
go
through
that
language,
i
just
want
to
--
to
note
that
this
argument
that
these
employees
were
not
bound
to
go
individually
to
arbitration
was
never
raised
below.
the
second
circuit
did
not
consider
it.
indeed,
the
second
circuit
found
that
the
clause
covered
these
employees,
and
--
and
this
only
came
up
in
the
respondents'
brief
in
this
court
after
cert
was
granted,
the
red
brief.
so
that
this
--
this
argument
is
one
that
the
factual
premises
for
were
never
considered
below
in
the
district
court
or
in
--
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
salvatore
yes,
your
honor.
and
--
and,
indeed,
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
--
and
we'll
look
at
the
language
in
1
second
--
are
--
are,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
a
little
more
complicated
to
understand
than
--
than
average
contracts.
you
have
to
look
at
the
practice
and
the
custom.
the
practice
here
for
this
union
has
been
to
turn
over
claims
to
the
individuals.
we've
had
this
clause
in
place
for
nine
years.
the
new
york
courts
have
enforced
it
repeatedly
and
--
and--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--it
was
--
it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
salvatore
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
salvatore
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
salvatore
a
blanket
ban--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--absolutely,
justice
scalia.
that
is
my
argument
with
respect
to
why
this
does
not
need
to
be
taken
up
now.
mr.
paul
salvatore
there
is
no
factual
record,
your
honor,
for
it
in
the
record
at
all.
and--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
salvatore
i
will.
the
clause
is
--
i
am
looking
now
at
petition
appendix
48a,
the
"no
discrimination"
clause.
this
is
the
--
the
clause
at
issue
in
this
case.
it
covers
any
present
or
future
employee.
it
goes
on
to
state
the
--
the
types
of
protected
characteristics
that
are
covered
by
this
clause
as
well
as
the
--
the
relevant
statutes
incorporating
statutory
law,
public
law,
in
the
--
in
the
clause.
and
then
in
the
second-to-last
sentence
five
lines
up
from
the
bottom
it,
states:
"all
such
claims
shall
be
subject
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
(articles
v
and
vi)
as
the
sole
and
exclusive
remedy
for
violations.
"
mr.
paul
salvatore
what
this
means,
justice
scalia,
is
that
these
individuals
cannot
go
to
court.
they
have
to
go
either
through
the
union,
as
has
been
the
practice
here,
or
the
union
will
turn
the
claim
over
to
them
and
let
them
go
by
themselves.
mr.
paul
salvatore
your
honor,
it
does
not
support
it
for
the
--
for
the
following
reason.
the
--
the
section
30
clause
on
page
48a,
the
1999.
it
was
added
after
the
court's
decision
in
wright.
it
was
added
to
comply
with
wright.
that's
an
undisputed
fact.
it
--
it
was
added
as
a
separate
section
with
a
separate
arbitration
promise
because
"all
claims"
is
broader
than
"union
claims".
75
years,
but
before
we
put
in
section
30--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--that's
correct.
mr.
paul
salvatore
no,
your
honor,
not
unless
--
not
if
the
union
turns
that
over.
the
employee's
reading--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--your
honor,
that
--
that
right
is
--
is
described
from
this
language,
"all
such
claims".
there
is
another
route.
what
articles
iv,
v,
and
vi
describe
is
that
--
that
the
--
you
must
go
to
the
office
of
the
contract
arbitrator,
and
it
doesn't
specify
whether
you
go
with
the
union
or
you
go
by
yourself.
mr.
paul
salvatore
no
court
has
decided
this
very
issue
like
this,
justice
alito.
but
what
the
new
york
courts
have
said
is,
in
interpreting
this
clause
over
the
last
nine
years,
that
they
compel
the
individual
union
member
to
go
to
arbitration
and
--
when
they
have
brought
claims
in
court
in
violation
of
this
clause.
mr.
paul
salvatore
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
salvatore
absolutely.
mr.
paul
salvatore
it
is,
justice
scalia.
it's
cited
in
our
briefing.
there
is
a
long
footnote
listing
the
cases.
but
--
but
you're
right,
the
--
the
issue
here
really
is,
can
the
union
agree
to
this?
and
that
goes
to
congress's
giving
the
union
the
power
under
section
9(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
be
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--well,
justice
breyer,
the
adea
provides
not
only
a
right
to
go
to
court
after
you've
gotten
your
right-to-sue
letter
or
waited
60
days,
but
--
but
it
also
provides
multiple
--
as
this
court
recognized
in
gilmer,
multiple
avenues
that
congress
wants
to
use:
conciliation,
persuasion,
conference--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--justice
breyer,
you
have
competing
policies
here
because
you
have
the
policies
of
the
labor
laws
which
say
that
unions
should
have
a
--
a
broad
portfolio
of
--
of
topics
to
bargain
about.
this
court
has
said
that
anything
germane
to
the
working
environment,
dispute
resolution
mechanisms--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--justice
ginsburg,
i
agree
to
the
degree
we're
talking
about
--
you're
talking
about
substantive
rights.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
procedural
switch.
as
this
court
has
approved
in
gilmer,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
moving
the
forum
from
the
judicial
one
to
the
--
to
the
arbitral
one.
and
here
in
the
--
the
scheme
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
where
arbitration
is
the
preferred
remedy
and
has
been
used
for
many,
many
years
very
successfully
in
the
--
in
the
--
by
those
parties.
it's
--
it's
taking
employment
arbitration
and
putting
it
in
the
collective
bargaining
context.
and
--
and
there
is
--
unions
do
this
in
many
different
ways.
unions
bargain
about
substantive
rights.
we
are
not
talking
about
substantive
rights
here,
though.
we
are
talking
about
procedural
rights.
and
the
policies
of
the
labor
laws
are
served
and
the
policies
of
the
adea
and
the
antidiscrimination
statutes
are
not
disserved
in
any
way.
mr.
paul
salvatore
that's
--
that's
the
practice
under
this
agreement,
your
honor.
we
would
--
we
would
wholeheartedly
endorse
that
--
that
rule
because,
that's
the
practice
here.
and
there
is
--
when
you're
talking
about
statutory
rights,
why
would
the
union
want
to
interfere
with
the
ability
of
the
employee
to
get
a
forum
if
their
interests
are
not
aligned?
this
goes
to
the
tension
that
this
court
has
--
has
recognized
in
its
prior
cases.
mr.
paul
salvatore
justice
kennedy,
the
employer
has
gotten
arbitration
and--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--well,
in--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--well,
that's
true.
the
union
--
the
union
wouldn't
play
that
function,
except
that
we
have
in
this
industry,
the
real
estate
industry
in
new
york
city,
a
longstanding
relationship
that
--
that
goes
back
decades.
and
--
and
--
so
it's
a
mature
collective
bargaining
arrangement.
and
the--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--well,
i
think
that
the
one--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--well,
one
of
the
issues
that
--
that
congress
allows
the
bargaining
parties
to
figure
out
is
what
the
scope
of
their
collective
bargaining
arrangement
should
be.
that's
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
the
nlra.
so,
yes,
some
collective
bargaining
parties
may
make
that
choice,
justice
kennedy;
others
may
make
a
different
choice.
what
is
the
alternative
here?
the
alternative
is
that
employers
can
bypass
the
union.
they
can
just
go
around
the
union
and
--
and
have
individual
gilmer
agreements
signed
up.
that's
what
the
d.c.
circuit
said
en
banc
in
--
in
--
in
the
alpa
pilots
case.
and
indeed,
the
--
the
union
in
that
case
was
arguing
the
position
that
we
are
arguing
here,
that
this
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining,
and
this
is
right
in
the
union's
portfolio
of
--
of
what
they
should
be
using
to
--
to
bargain
with
the
employer
because
it's
a
procedural
right
and
there
are
no
substantive
outcomes
that
are
diminished
in
any
way
whatsoever.
unions
are
deemed
trustworthy
enough
to
bring
lawsuits
in
the
federal
courts
on
behalf
of
their
members.
under
principles
of
associational
standing,
associational
standing,
the
members
are
bound
by
their
--
their
union's
actions.
the
eeoc--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--absolutely,
justice
ginsburg.
the
--
the
--
the
--
and
this
type
of
service
is
one
of
the
core
functions
that
an
agency
payer
would
have
to
pay
for.
the
lm-2
that
32b,
the
local,
filed
here
on
behalf
of
80,000
employees
has
two
agency
fee
payers
out
of
80,000.
so
it's
not
really
an
issue
in
this
case.
but
that's
what
unions
are
for.
when
congress
makes
them
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
you're
--
you're
in
for
it
one
way
or
the
other.
you're
--
you're
--
either
you're
in
or
you're
out.
and
if
you're
in,
then
you
have
to
go
along
with
the
--
the
--
the
entire
collective
bargaining
deal
that
is
made--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--in
--
in
this
situation,
the
employer
pays.
that's
the
only
--
the
office
of
the
contract
arbitrator
is
an
--
essentially
a
mini
--
american
arbitration
association
that
these
parties
have
set
up,
and
the
rab,
which
is
the
multi-employer
organization
that
represents
all
the
real
estate
employers
in
--
in
new
york,
they
pay
for
the
arbitration,
because
the
union
in
this
case
has
said
we
are
not
going
to
pay.
as
you
point
out
rightly,
if
the
union
is
not
involved,
they
--
they
shouldn't
pay.
so
there's
no
cost
to
the
employee
for
that
arbitration
and
--
and
as
justice
edwards
said
in
the
d.c.
circuit
coal
case,
that
--
that
that
procedure
is
--
is
a
fair
one,
to
have
the
employer
pick
up
the
--
the
costs
given
--
given
the
--
the
balance
between
the
--
the
two
of
them.
mr.
paul
salvatore
yes
--
yes,
your
honor,
justice
stevens.
gardner-denver
is
--
is
a
case,
as
this
court
has
described,
that
--
that
didn't
involve
the
enforceability
of
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
the
gardner-denver
line
of
cases,
mcdonald
and
barrentine
and
gardner-denver,
had
the
quite
different
issue
as
this
court
said
in
gilmer,
of
whether
a
contract-based
claim
precludes
subsequent
judicial
resolution
of
a
statutory
claim;
and
so
that
distinguishes
the
rule.
but
factually
these
cases
are
very
different
as
--
as
well.
mr.
alexander
in
alexander
v.
gardner-denver
--
the
contract
there,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
had
a
plain
vanilla
arbitration
clause.
it
didn't
have
a
clause
like
the
one
we
looked
at
page
--
petition
appendix
48a,
that
incorporated
all
the
--
the
statutes
and
gave
the
arbitrator
the
power
to
sit
and
--
and
to
apply
those
statutes
and
apply
the
law
under
those
statutes
and
apply
the
remedies
that
derive
from
those
statutes.
in
that
case,
the
arbitrator
sat
as
the
proctor
of
the
bargain
between
the
collective
bargaining
parties,
and
didn't
have
that
broad
authority,
as
this
court
has
--
has
recognized.
and
--
and
we
agree
that
arbitration
that
--
that
resolves
just
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
claim
should
not
be
dispositive
of
a
statutory
claim.
they're
fish
and
fowl.
so
that
gardner-denver
is
correctly
decided.
gardner-denver
puts
out
the
rule
for
--
for
that
situation.
this
is
a
different
situation
that
we
are
talking
about.
and
--
and
here,
unlike
in
gardner-denver,
where
mr.
alexander
would
have
had
no
access
to
the
--
to
have
his
title
vii
claim
heard
if
this
court
had
affirmed
the
tenth
circuit,
he
--
the
door
to
the
courthouse
would
have
been
shut
in
that
case
for
mr.
alexander.
here
we
are
trying
to
move
to
compel
arbitration
so
that
there
is
a
forum,
and
--
and
that
these
individuals
--
these
employees--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--an
arbitral
forum,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
salvatore
that's
--
that's
correct.
that's
the
union
counsel's
affidavit.
he
was
saying
he
doesn't
--
the
union
doesn't
want
to
pick
up
the
costs,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
says
there
is
two
payers
in
the
office
of
the
contract
arbitrator,
the
rab
and
the
union.
if
the
union
is
not
paying,
then
the
rab
has
to
pay.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
please.
mr.
paul
salvatore
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
couple
of
quick
points
in
response.
mr.
paul
salvatore
and
i
refer
you,
justice
ginsburg,
to
page
47a
of
the
joint
--
of
the
petition
appendix,
which
contains
the
mainframe
arbitration
article
vi
of
this
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
last
paragraph--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--47a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
last
paragraph
on
that
page.
mr.
paul
salvatore
i'm
sorry?
mr.
paul
salvatore
article
vi
starts
on
43a.
it
goes
all
the
way
over
to
47a
of
the
petition
appendix,
right
before
the
ellipses
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
paul
salvatore
again,
vi.
mr.
paul
salvatore
the
costs
of
the
office
of
the
contract
arbitrator
shall
be
shared
equally
in
a
manner
determined
by
the
union
and
the
rab.
the
way
that
the
parties
--
the
bargaining
parties
have
determined
that
these
costs
be
shared
is
that
if
--
if
the
union
is
not
involved
in
a
case,
the
employer
pays.
and
--
and
so,
that's
--
i
mean,
that's
right
from
the--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--that's
--
that's
the
--
the
agreement
between
the
collective
bargaining
parties.
it's
not
--
it's
not
written
down
beyond
that
--
that
--
that
place.
the
office
--
that
place
in
the
contract.
the
office
of
the
contract
arbitrator
is
--
is
--
is
a
place.
it's
an
arbitration
forum.
it's
like
going
to
the
american
arbitration
association.
it
has
hearing
rooms.
it
--
it
--
there
--
it
has
administrators
who
assign
the
arbitrators.
the
arbitrators
aren't
picked
out
of
--
you
know,
by
one
side
or
the
other.
yes,
they
are
put
on
the
panel
by
--
by
the
bargaining
parties,
but
they
are
picked
by
a
case
administrator.
there
are
700
arbitrations
that
go
on
in
this
industry
every
year,
and
that's
why
instead
of
going
to
the
american
arbitration
association,
these
parties
a
long
time
ago
set
up
their
own.
a
couple--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
and
there
are
--
are
several
points.
first,
there
is
no
conflict
here
in
this
case.
the
union
did
the
right
thing.
it
turned
the
claim
over
to
the
individual
employees
with
their
private
counsel
and
let
them
go
arbitrate
it
themselves.
they
refused.
this
isn't
a
magnavox
situation.
the
union
is
not--
mr.
paul
salvatore
--let
me
explain
that
time
frame,
justice
souter.
what
happened
here
was
the
claim
was
originally
tendered
by
these
employees
to
the
union
to
bring
an
arbitration.
the
union
decided
after
the
first
hearing
day
with
the
arbitrator
that
they
couldn't
go
forward
for
whatever
reasons
--
it's
not
in
the
record
--
and
then
they
--
several
months
went
by,
these
employees
filed
with
their
counsel
at
the
eeoc
under
waffle
house,
we
did
nothing
and
waited
and
the
--
representing
the
employers,
and
then
the
--
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
at
that
point
the
record
is
clear
that
demand
was
made
on
--
on
the
employee's
counsel,
mr.
kreisberg
--
it's
in
his
affidavit
--
that
--
that
he
return
to
arbitrator
pfeiffer
to
the
pending
arbitration
and
continue
in
that
forum,
and
he
refused
to.
that
was
the
basis
of
the
motion
to
compel.
mr.
paul
salvatore
thank
you.
