but
here
it
wasn't.
justice

here
we
are
dealing
with
claims
that
the
union
said:
sorry,
we
are
not
going
to
process
these
claims
because
we
have
some
tension
since
the
younger
workers
that
replaced
you,
we
also
represent
them.
so
you
are
proposing,
as
far
as
i
understand
it,
a
situation
where
these
workers
would
have
no
individual
right
at
all
if
the
union
says:
we
--
we
won't
represent
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
--
where
does
the
contract
say
anything
about
the
--
the
individual
succeeding
to
whatever
arrangement
there
is
between
the
union
and
the
employer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
only
--
only
the
union
can
invoke
the
arbitration
clause,
not
an
individual.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
union
could
not
bargain
about
these
anti
discrimination
rights.
these
are
rights
given
to
individuals
by
congress.
the
union
couldn't
bargain
about
them
the
way
it
bargains
about
collective
rights,
the
way
it
bargains
about
wages
and
hours
and
--
and
other
things.
this
is
--
this
is
not
a
bargainable
right.
this
is
a
right
--
congress
says
you
as
an
individual
have
a
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against.
there's
nothing
that
the
union
can
bargain
about.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
nonmembers,
too?
what
about
the
people
who
--
who
are
not
members
of
the
union,
but
they
have
to
pay
an
equivalent
amount
for
the
union's
services
in
collective
bargaining?
they
would
be
bound
as
well?
they
couldn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
said
--
the
--
fine.
i
--
i
grasp
your
answer
to
that.
but
you
said
that
the
employee
would
have
the
absolute
right
if
the
union
says,
"sorry,
for
whatever
reason
we
can't
represent
you.
"
absolute
right
to
that
arbitral
forum.
what
--
who
pays
then?
i
mean,
if
the
union
is
in
it,
then
the
union
and
the
employer
are
going
to
split
--
split
the
cost.
but
what
happens
when
the
union
drops
out
and
you
have
the
individual
and
the
employer
in
this
arbitral
forum?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
salvatore,
would
you
just
clarify
something
for
me?
i
thought
that
the
union
ceded
its
rights
to
the
employees
and
said
that
they
could
use
the
collective
bargaining
agreement's
arbitral
regime
so
long
as
they
paid
for
it.
but
you
tell
me
they
don't
have
to
pay
anything;
the
employer
pays
everything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
it's
not
a
statutory
right;
it's
just
a
wrongful
discharge?
one
practical
problem
is
so
often
these
are
overlapping
claims.
you
can
say,
"i
was
discriminated
against
before
because
of
my
age.
"
"i
was
arbitrarily
discriminated
against.
"
"it
was
a
wrongful
discharge.
"
"it
was
a
discharge
without
just
cause.
"
usually,
there's
multiple
claims
that
can
be
made,
and
some
of
them
would
be
bargainable,
i
mean,
would
come
under
the
union
--
i
mean
if
it
was
just
a
question
of
the
worker
says,
"i
was
discharged
without
just
cause.
"
no
title
vii
or
anything
else,
that
would
come
under
the
arbitration
clause,
wouldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
argument
that
you
are
--
if
you
win
this
case,
you
are
subjecting
the
employee
to
a
worse
situation
because
the
employer
will
simply
say:
fine,
i
don't
have
to
bargain
anything
with
the
union.
if
you
want
to
work
in
this
workplace,
you
sign
an
arbitration
agreement
that
says
you
have
no
access
to
the
court,
and
you
have
to
--
just
like
in
gilmer,
just
like
in
circuit
city.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
salvatore,
would
you
straighten
out
this
business
it
seems
about
who
pays?
mr.
frederick
said
that
50
percent
would
have
to
be
paid
by
the
employee.
if
the
union
bows
out
and
there
is
just
the
employer
and
the
employee
in
the
arbitration,
that
the
employee
would
have
to
pick
up
50
percent.
i
think
i
understood
him
to
say
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
page
did
you
--
did
you
reference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
--
if
the
idea
is
that
the
union
cedes
its
right
to
the
worker,
then
doesn't
it
have
to
--
doesn't
the
burden
go
with
the
right
as
well?
i
mean,
the
--
if
the
union
would
pay,
you're
saying
that
the
employer
will
just
accept
that
the
employer
picks
up
the
entire
tab?
