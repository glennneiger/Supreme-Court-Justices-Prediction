mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
start
with
regulation
201.80,
which
is
set
forth
in
an
addendum
to
our
brief
at
19-a.
the
second
sentence
of
which
reads:
"the
labeling
shall
be
revised
--
this
is
after
an
applicant,
a
sponsor
has
obtained
approval
of
the
drug
label
--.
"
it
shall
be
revised
to
include
a
warning
as
soon
as
there
is
reasonable
evidence
of
an
association
of
a
serious
risk
with
a
drug.
a
causal
relationship
need
not
have
been
proved.
"the
testimony
at
trial
established
that
wyeth
knew
or
should
have
known
from
at
least
the
'70s
that
there
was
a
significant
issue
concerning
iv
push
risks.
"
"and,
justice
alito,
in
answer
to
your
question--
"
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--fda
never
considered
any
comparative
risks
of
iv
push
versus
iv
drip.
the
evidence
on
this
was
clear.
wyeth
had
a--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--what
the
evidence
showed
was
that
fda
certainly
was
aware
that
there
are
different
forms
of
intravenous
administration
of
drugs,
but
it
never
considered
that
the
risk
of
iv
push
so
greatly
increased
the
risks
of
a
catastrophic
injury--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--mr.
chief
justice,
here
there
was
no
way
fda
could
have
made
this
determination
because
the
risks
of
iv
push
are
so
catastrophic
compared
to
the
benefit
which
the
testimony
at
trial
showed--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
testimony
at
trial
showed
that
the
doctor
acted
with
a
standard
of
care
that
was
not
negligent,
and
that
was
based
on
expert
testimony.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
the
testimony
at
trial
showed
that
that
had
no
bearing
on
her
injury,
because--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
it
did.
the
testimony
at
trial
from
dr.
green
disputed
that
point.
both
courts
below
rejected
that
notion.
but
the
idea
that
a
label
is
set
in
stone
for
all
time
misunderstands
the
way
the
process
works.
when
fda
approves
a
drug
with
a
drug
label,
it
does
so
on
the
basis
of
small
clinical
trials
with
very
few,
sometimes
as
few
as
a
thousand
or
a
couple
of
thousand
people.
and
when
the
drug
is
marketed
and
goes
to
lots
and
lots
of
people
that
are
not
healthy,
that
are
in
different
conditions,
new
problems
arise.
that's
why
the
general
--
the
gao
found
that
over
51
percent
of
drugs
have
adverse
drug
events
not
known.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
was
not
our
burden
and
that
was
not
how
the
testimony
came
in
at
trial.
but
as
the
amicus
brief
by
dr.
budhwani,
et
al.
at
pages
54
establishes
had
wyeth
been
a
reasonably
prudent
manufacturer
over
the
years,
it
would
have
known
that
the
risks
of
iv
push
so
far
outweigh
any
bearing
negligible
benefits,
that
it
would
have
offered
a
stronger
instruction,
it
would
have
moved
to
revise
its
label
either
with
fda
approval
or--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--footnote
one
of
the
vermont
supreme
court's
opinion
disputes
that
point,
because
it
says
the
label
was
different.
and
if
you
compare
what
was
submitted
to
fda
versus
what
fda
looked
at,
there
was
no
reference
to
iv
push
risks
creating
the
risk
of
catastrophic
harm
versus
negligible
benefits,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
as
the
jury
was
instructed,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
evidence
came
in
at
trial,
it
was
--
it
was
somewhat
larger
than
that
in
the
sense
that
a
state
failure
to
warn
claim
doesn't
prescribe
particular
wording.
it
simply
says
that
the
existing
wording
is
inadequate.
and
if
the
case
comes
to
this
court--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--but
the
label
itself
is
not
set
in
stone,
mr.
chief
justice.
manufacturers
change
their
labels
all
the
time
as
new
drug
risks
come
in.
and
the
regulations
provide
that
the
manufacturer
is
responsible
not
only
for
the
label,
but
for
monitoring
post-market
information.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
it's
not
dependent
on
that
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
dependent
on
a
finding
that
the
manufacturer
had
a
duty
of
due
care
and
it
didn't
live
up
to
that.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
testimony--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
question
is
what
does
the
manufacturer
know
and
when
did
this
manufacturer
know
it?
and
here,
the
testimony
at
trial
showed
that
an
antinausea
drug
called
vistrol
--
this
is
at
page
79
of
the
joint
appendix
--
caused
amputations
in
two
cases.
pfizer
voluntarily
removed
iv
push
injection
for
that
drug.
this
was
information
in
wyeth's
files;
wyeth
knew
this
from
the
1970s;
and
yet
it
did
nothing
to
change
the
phenergan
label.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
the
fda
itself
said
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
at
page
25
that
it
was
deemed
to
be
a
nonsubstantive
change.
these
were
changes
that
were
being
made--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
was
a
different
label
and
it
was
a
different
strength
of
warning,
but
it
didn't
have
to
do
with
the
relative
risks
and
benefits
of
iv
push
versus
iv
drip.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
was
the
crucial
point.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
this
is
set
out
at
footnote
of
the
vermont
supreme
court
opinion,
which
is
set
out
in
the
joint
--
in
the
petition
appendix
at
pages
4a
to
5a,
and
it
goes
on
for
two
pages.
but
essentially
what
the
--
what
the
comparison
was
was
talking
about
the
preferability
of
injecting
it
through
the
tubing
of
an
intravenous
infusion
set
that
is
known
to
be
functioning
satisfactorily,
which
would
suggest
to
most
medical
practitioners
and
was
it
the
case
in
the
trial
testimony
given
by
dr.
green
below,
that
that
would
suggest
an
iv
drip,
not
iv
push.
when
fda
then
rejected
it
for
--
for
nonsubstantive
reasons,
it
went
back
to
the
prior
verbiage
which
is
set
out
at
5a,
which
simply
says
if
you
put
this
drug
in
an
artery
the
concentration
can
be
such
that
it
will
--
it
will
cause
harm.
but
our
point
is
that
these
kinds
of
risks
come
to
light
frequently
with
drugs
that
are
on
the
market
and
the
need
to
revise
these
labels
is
the
duty
of
the
manufacturer.
section
314--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
how
you--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
think
that
the
dispute
is
--
is
what
constitutes
new
information,
because
we
don't
take
issue
with
the
notion
that
new
information
can
be
new
analysis
of
prior
submitted
data;
and
what
the
amicus
brief
by
dr.
budhwani
et
al.
points
out
is
that
there
was
a
lot
of
unpublished
information
about
the
harms
of
phenergan
that
was
known
to
wyeth
or
should
have
been
known
to
wyeth
in
the
'80s
and
'90s
that
would
have
justified
a
change
under
the
cee
regulations.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
be
pre-empted.
and
the
reason
it
would
be
pre-empted
is
because
the
fda
would
have
considered
and
rejected
on
the
basis
of
the
same
information
or
similar
information
the
very
duty
that
underlies
the
state
claim.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
it's
--
well,
it
is
not
--
i
think
there
are
two
things
to
keep
analytically
clear.
one
is
can
the
manufacturer
come
forward
with
a
label
change
on
the
basis
of
--
of
information
that
is
assessing
the
risk
or
reassessing
the
risks,
and
under
the
--
under
the
regulations
it's
absolutely
clear
it
can
do
that
before
fda
has
approved
it.
it
is
subject
to
fda
disapproval.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
scalia,
that
would
promote
public
safety,
because
it
puts
into
the
hands
of
doctors
the
information
that
enables
them
to
make
individualized
risk
determinations.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
congress
said--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
and
in
fact
that's
contrary
to
the
policy
determination
congress
made.
in
the
misbranding
provision,
which
is
section
352(f),
it
calls
--
that
the
label
is
misbranded
unless
its
labeling
bears
adequate
directions
for
use
and
such
adequate
warnings
against
use
in
those
pathological
conditions
or
by
children
where
its
use
may
be
dangerous
to
health
or
against
unsafe
dosage
or
methods
or
duration
of
administration
or
application.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
it's
misbranded.
and
in
the
1979--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
--
it
provides
you
a
basis
for
marketing
your
--
your
product.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
--
the
fda
itself
said
so
in
1979
in
44
federal
register,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
that
even
an
original
label
may
be
misbranded
if
the
drug
manufacturer
subsequently
learns
that
it
was
not
adequate
for
the
safe
use
of
the
drug.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
it's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
information
developed
after
the
original
label
is
approved,
and
it
is
not
a
floor
and
a
ceiling--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
that's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--our
position
is
that
the
duty
is
on
the
manufacturer
to
make
a
safe
label,
and
if
the
label
is--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
fair,
but
let
me
just
make
clear
that
our
test
would
require
the
fda
to
consider
and
reject
the
specific
basis
on
which
the
state
law--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i'm
not
going
to
retract
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
basis
--
the
basis
of
the
fda's
approval
is
on
the
basis
of
limited
information,
which
congress
has
said
for
public
safety
reasons
--
we
are
not
doing
a
balancing
here;
we
are
doing
this
for
public
safety
--
and
if
the
label
is
not
adequate
for
public
safety
it
is
a
misbranded
drug.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
--
i
think
there
is
pre-emption,
but
that
does
not
mean--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--maybe
there
is
no--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--let
me
try
to
untangle
it
this
way.
the
fact
that
there
is
pre-emption
and
you
cannot
bring
as
state
law
failure-to-warn
claim
doesn't
mean
that
the
drug
isn't
misbranded
under
the
federal
standard
the
fda--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
if--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
the
--
the
point--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--in
that
very
hypothetical,
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
the
point
is
that
the
failure
is
that
the
failure-to-warn
claim
tracks
the
misbranding
provision;
and
if
you
look
at
the
jury
instructions
in
this
case,
the
wording
is
very
close
to
the
wording
of
the
misbranding
provision
in
terms
of
the
adequacy
of
the
warning
that
must
be
provided.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
all
state
law
is
doing
is
providing
a
remedy
that
is
absent
from
federal
law.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
fact
is
there
was
no
consideration
and
rejection
of
a
stronger
iv
push
warning.
there
was
no
consideration
by
the
fda
of
iv
push
as
a
means
of
administration
distinct
from
other
intravenous
forms
that
would
lead
to
a
different
kind
of
risk-benefit
balancing.
so
with
the
--
in
the
case
where
there
would
be
pre-emption,
fda
would
be
asked,
we
--
we
want
to
put
a
stronger
warning
as
against
this
--
fda
says:
we
don't
think
there
is
scientific
evidence.
do
not
put
that
warning
on
the
label.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
the
vermont
supreme
court
was
quite
emphatic
about
this,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
you
search
in
the
joint
appendix
in
vain
for
communications
between
wyeth
and
fda
communicating
about
the
particular
risks
of
iv
push.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
will
acknowledge
that
the
references
in
some
instances
suggest
iv
push.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
fda
knew
that
iv
push
was
a
method
of
intravenous
administration,
but
our
point
is
a
starker
one,
and
that
is
that
the
fda
never
was
put
to
the
test
of
deciding
comparative
risks
and
benefits
of
iv
push
versus
iv
drip.
and
it's
that
point
that
is
crucial,
because
the
catastrophic
risks
of
iv
push
are
so
dramatic,
no
reasonable
person
could
have
made
a
safety
determination
to
allow
this
drug
with
its
risks
when
there
are
corresponding
benefits
that
create
exactly
the
same
kind
of
treatment
of
care
for
the
patient.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it's
two
things:
one,
they
didn't
consider
it
and
that's
clearly--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--second,--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--there
are
communications
that
went
back
and
forth
between
the
company.
these
are
set
out
in
the
joint
appendix.
they
make
no
reference
to
iv
push
risks
as
distinct
from--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
original
application
actually
is
not
known.
it
wasn't
in
wyeth's
files.
this
drug
was
approved
in
1955.
we
don't
know
where
the
original
label
was,
justice
souter.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
does
not,
justice
scalia.
the
label
says
--
it's
talking
about
intravenous
administration.
it
does
not
distinguish
between
iv
drip
and
iv
push.
and
dr.
matthew
testified
at
trial
that,
based
on
the
label,
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
make
a
treatment
determination
to
distinguish
between
the
two,
and
that
had
he
had
that
information,
he
clearly
would
have
given
this
drug
to
diana
levine
through
the
intravenous
drip
method.
the
label
simply
didn't--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
i
think
it
can
be
sustained
on
the
basis
of--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
don't
think
that
the
vermont
supreme
court's
opinion
totally,
because
it
does
go
into
the
area
that
you're
talking
about,
justice
kennedy,
but
if
i
could
refer
the
court
to
trial
record
testimony,
which
is
set
out
in
the
joint
appendix
and
more
elaborately
in
the
trial
record
itself,
which
makes
clear
that
wyeth
knew
or
should
have
known
about
these
comparative
risks.
it
should
have
had
a
basis
for
changing
its
label
or
proposing
to
fda
a
different
label,
and
that
would
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
federal
standards
as
well
as
the
state
duty
of
due
care.
and
we
think
the
judgment
on
that
basis
could
be
sustained.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
it
probably
arose
in
the
early
'70s
when
a
--
when
there
was
a
published
--
or
there
was
an
incident--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--a
strong
argument
can
be
made
that
it
would
have
been
before
the
1970s
application
when
they
were
reformatting.
these
are
old
drugs.
we
don't
have
evidence
from
the
1950s
that
would
have
suggested
that
the
original
label
determination
in
1955
would
have
caused
a
difference
but
certainly
by
the
1970s
when
--
when
wyeth
was
reformatting
this
as
an
old
drug
to
comply
with
new
standards,
it
should
have
known
and
it
certainly
should
have
known
by
the
1990s
when
several
amputations
had
occurred
from
iv
push
phenergan,
which
were
in
wyeth's
files.
the
people
who
analyzed
these
records,
you
know,
were
emphatic
that
wyeth
knew
or
should
have
known
by
the
1990s.
and
that
was
clear
by
the
testimony
of
experts
that
--
that
showed
the
comparison
between
vistrol
and
phenergan
and
on
the
basis
of
the
iv
push
injuries
that
had
occurred
that
were
nonpublished.
they
appeared
to
have
been
reported
to
fda,
but
wyeth
never
took
the
trouble
to
do
the
synthesis,
to
connect
the
dots
between
these
very
terrible
tragedies
that
had
occurred
from
its
drug,
to
bring
about
a
labeling
change
or
a
modification
that
would
have
saved
lives.
and
that
is
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
manufacturer
not
to
comply
with
its
standards
of
due
care
and
with
the
regulations
which
require
health
risk
information
to
be
the
basis
of
modifications
to
the
labeling.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
by
1955
or
do
you
mean
in
1998
and
2000?
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
would
be
on
the
basis,
i
think,
of
both.
i
think
we
would
be
able
to
establish
that
there
was
a
justification
on
the
basis
of
information
before
the
reformatted
labeling
took
place,
and
that
was
testimony
by
dr.
green
at
trial
on
the
basis
of
vistrol,
the
other
amputation
that
had
occurred
with
phenergan
in
1965.
and
the
--
the
important
point
here
is
that
on
the
basis
of
new
information,
if
you
are
going
to
conclude
that
there
is
a
standard
that
has
to
be
met,
i
would
urge
you
to
consider
two
things:
one
is
that
the
burden
of
showing
absence
of
new
information
is
going
to
fall
on
the
manufacturer
because
it
is
asserting
a
pre-emption
defense,
but
the
way
pre-emption
gets
argued
in
the
courts,
it
is
done
oftentimes
before
discovery
is
permitted.
so,
if
there
is
information
in
the
drug
manufacturer's
files
that
would
be
relevant
to
a
determination
of
the
breach
of
duty
by
the
drug
manufacturer,
if
you
decide
pre-emption
has
to
be
done
before
discovery
can
be
done,
there
would
be
no
way
to
get
that
information.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
let
me
--
let
me
address
that
question
because
your
question
goes
to
the
regulatory
compliance
defense
and
that
is
not
a
pre-emption
defense.
it
is
a
defense
based
on
state
law
that
the
manufacturer
in
fact
was
not
negligent
because
it
complied
with
the
applicable
regulations.
in
that
--
under
that
scenario,
justice
kennedy,
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
be
able
to
obtain
discovery
and
make
arguments
to
the
trial
court
about
whether
or
not
that
compliance
negated
or
did
not
negate
negligence.
but
pre-emption
is
a
federal
defense
that
would
be
asserted
typically
at
the
outset
of
the
lawsuit
before
information
is
obtained.
and
notably,
before
2000,
fda
did
not
have
subpoena
power
of
drug
manufacturers.
it
did
not
have
the
power
to
force
labeling
changes.
it
didn't
even
have
the
power
to
force
drug
manufacturers
to
make
post-marketing
studies.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i'm
not
totally,
justice
breyer,
i
confess,
but
let
me
try
to
address
it
this
way.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
you
are
absolutely
right
about
that.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
the
duty
is
always
going
to
be
on
the
manufacturer,
justice
breyer.
the
regulations
at
314.80(b)
establish
that
the
--
that
the
manufacturer
has
the
responsibility
to
do
postmarketing
analysis
and
post-marketing
surveys
to
determine
the
continuing
safety
of
its
drugs.
if
the
manufacturer
doesn't
do
that,
it
isn't
complying
with
the
federal
regulations
which
have
an
ongoing
duty
on
them.
and
so
in
the
case
where
there
is
silence,
i
would
respectfully
submit
the
manufacturer
is
not
complying
with
its
regulatory
duty
to
ensure
that
there
is
current
information
about
all
of
the
side-effect
risks
of
its
drugs.
thank
you.
