justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
could
the
--
how
could
the
fda
concluded
that
iv
push
was
safe
and
effective
when
on
the
benefit
side
of
this
you
don't
have
a
life-saving
drug,
you
have
a
drug
that
relieves
nausea,
and
on
the
risk
side
you
have
the
risk
of
gangrene?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
the
record
showed
that
the
fda
clearly
considered
whether
iv
push
should
be
contraindicated
and
concluded
it
should
not
be
and
prescribed
the
label
that
now
appears
on
the
drug;
and
then,
as
some
of
the
other
arguments
have
referenced,
the
very
day
after
the
fda
made
that
ruling,
ms.
levine
was
injured.
would
you
still
--
would
she
still
have
a
claim
in
your
view,
a
non-pre-empted
claim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
your
argument
is
--
is
predicated
on
the
existence
of
new
information.
if
there
was
no
new
information,
then
the
claim
is
pre-empted?
