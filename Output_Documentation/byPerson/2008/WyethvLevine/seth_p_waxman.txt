mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
conflict
pre-emption
under
the
supremacy
clause,
and
the
conflict
presented
here
is
stark.
repeatedly
over
the
years,
the
fda
approved
phenergan
injection
as
safe
and
effective
under
all
the
conditions
and
methods
of
use
described
in
the
labeling,
including
what
is
referred
to
as
iv
push>
["]
injection.
yet
a
state
jury,
evaluating
the
same
risk
that
the
fda
had
considered,
determined
that
the
precise
labeling
that
fda
had
required
wyeth
to
use
in
fact
rendered
phenergan
"unreasonably
dangerous".
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
let
me
make
sure,
because
i
do
think
we
do
agree,
and
i
want
to
make
sure
that
i'm
understood,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
what
you've
articulated
is
the
test
which
is,
is
it
possible
for
a
regulated
party
to
comply
at
the
same
time
with
both
federal
law
and
state
law?
in
other
words,
could
they
use,
as
they
were
required
by
federal
law
to
do,
to
use
the
precise
label
that
in
approving
the
application
in
1998
the
fda
required
wyeth
to
use,
and
also
use
the
label
that
the
vermont
jury
determined
should
be
used,
and
that
was
stated
in
the
complaint
and
in
the
opening
and
the
closing
a
statement
that
you
may
not,
should
not
use
iv
administration
or
iv
push,
in
other
words
that
you
should
contra
--
the
label
should
contra-indicate
something--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes
it
did,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
want
to
cite
you
to
the
portions
of
the
record
that
demonstrate
that
it
did.
but
before
i
do
so,
i
just
want
to
underscore
a
point
that
i
think
is
clear
from
both
our
brief
and
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
which
is
that
isn't
the
test
of
preemption
in
any
event.
the
question
is
what
did
the
labeling
say
and
upon
what
information
was
the
labeling
decision
made.
but
as
to
your
particular
question,
there
are
--
first
of
all,
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
from
multiple
parties,
including
experts
from
both
sides,
that
the
fda
was
aware
of
all
of
the
forms
of
administration
and
the
risk,
including
iv
push.
their
experts
simply
disagreed
with
the
judgment
that
the
labeling
requires.
but
most
saliently,
the
labeling
in
this
case,
which
is
reproduced,
in
sort
of
microscopic
size
unfortunately,
on
the
last
two
pages
of
the
petitioner
appendix
and
the
last
two
pages
of
the
joint
appendix,
have
four
separate
reference
that,
as
we
explained
in
footnote
11
of
our
reply
brief,
only
apply
to
iv
push.
there
is
a
reference
to
the
use
of
the
tubex
system.
that
is
a
direct
iv
push
system.
there
is
a
reference
to
rigid
plungers
and
small-bore
needles.
again
nothing
to
do
with
drip.
there
is
a
reference
to
a
maximum
rate
of
administration.
drip
is
gravity.
the
testimony
in
the
case
was
that
an
instruction
that
a
particular
rate
of
administration
not
be
exceeded
only
referred
to
iv
push.
and
finally,
there
are
cautions
on
the
label
about
how
the
ordinary
aspiration
of
blood
to
see
if
its
bright
or
dark,
which
is
only
done
in
the
context
of
a
needle
that
is
being
used
to
push
something
into
a
vein,
is
not
reliable
in
the
context
of
this
case
because
phenergan
discolors
arterial
blood
immediately.
so
the
labeling
plainly
comprehended
and
warned
about
the
specific
risks
of
iv
push
administration,
and
that's
not
all.
there
is
an
advisory
--
an
advisory
committee
in
1976
was
asked
to
look
at
precisely
the
risk
of
arterial
exposure
to
phenergan
injection
or
any
other
irritant
drug
that
is
administered
intravenously
and
it
made
specific
recommendations,
including
recommendations
that
go
directly
to
iv
push.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
mean,
there
was
testimony
--
justice
alito,
i
can
go
over
the
testimony,
but
there
is
--
there
was
testimony
in
this
very
case
about
those
very
circumstances
in
which
direct
iv
injection
is
indicated.
and
there
is
also
test
--
there
is
also
evidence
in
the
fda
record,
including
if
you
look
at
the
1987
correspondence
that
the
fda
sent
to
wyeth
in
the
context
of
talking
about
what
warnings
had
to
be
provided.
the
fda
provided
wyeth
20
citations
to
20
medical
journals
that
addressed
this
problem,
and
in
footnote
13
of
our
reply
brief
we've
cited
the
ones
that
specifically
address
the
circumstances
in
which
iv
push
administration
is
an
important
tool.
the
point
here
is,
i
think,
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
ginsburg,
this
is
labeling
that
is
directed
at
medical
professionals.
it
is
labeling
that
is
directed
at
physicians,
who
have
to
be
able
to
determine
what
method,
what
pharmaceutical
and
what
method
of
administration
to
use,
given
the
constellation
of
risks
and
benefits
that
a
particular
patient--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
fda
--
well,
the
fda
certainly
is.
and
the
issue,
justice
kennedy,
here
is
the
fda
has
to
decide
what
information
to
provide
to
clinicians
so
that
they
can
make
judgments
about
what
to
use.
and
it
--
what
it
did
here
is
it
provided
ample,
lavish
warnings
about
the
risk
of
intra-arterial
injection
and
exposure
of
an
irritant
drug
like
phenergan
to
arterial
blood.
it
provided
in
the
labeling
to
the
physicians
a
cascading
hierarchy
of
methods
of
administration.
it
said
intramuscular
injection
is
the
preferred
method.
it
then
said
with
respect
to
intravenous
injection
that
it
is,
as
with
any
irritant
drug,
it
is
usually
preferable
to
inject
it
into
an
iv
infusion
set
that
is
known
to
be
running
properly,
in
other
words
where
a
line
has
already
been
established
into
the
vein
and
the
iv
push
occurs
into
the
line
that's
already
established.
all
that
information
was
available
to
physicians
and
the
fda
has
to
understand
and
does
understand
that
in
labeling
to
allow
medical
professionals
to
make
their
judgments,
taking
options
away
from
physicians
is
not
always
better.
it
may
not
--
it
may
not
even
often
be
better.
what
the
fda
has
to
decide
in
terms
of
telling
physicians
what's
on
the
table
and
what's
off
the
table
and
in
terms
of
what's
on
the
table
what
the
relevant
risks
are
is,
is
this
ever
--
would
this
ever
be
medically
warranted?
the
testimony
in
this
case
and
in
the
administrative
record
was
yes,
there
are
circumstances--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
i
mean,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
you've
identified
the
respect
in
which
this
is
different
than
the
medical
device
area.
but
for
the
salient
purposes,
i
think
the
riegel
case
directly
points
the
court
to
the
nature
of
the
determination
that
the
fda
makes
with
respect
to
class
3
drugs.
it
goes
through
the
same
preclearance
process.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
as
i
think
justice
scalia's
opinion
in
riegel
points
out,
the
balancing
time-intensive,
data-intensive
inquiry
for
medical
devices
was
patterned
after
what
is
done
for
drugs,
and
it
reflects
a
balancing
of
risks
and
benefits
of
the
particular
drug
in
light
of
the
conditions
and
methods
of
administration
prescribed
in
the
labeling.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
let
me
address
both
the
established
background
of
state
actions
and
then
the
pre-emption
clause
difference,
if
i
may.
the
respondent
and
her
amici
have
identified
97
cases
going
back
150
years
in
which
tort
actions
have
been
brought
with
respect
to
pharmaceuticals.
very
few
of
those
cases
--
and
they
are
recent
--
are
implicated
by
the
rule
that
the
vermont
supreme
court
applied
in
this
case,
which
is
where
a
fully
informed
fda,
informed
of
all
the
information
that
wyeth
had,
approved
a
labeling
standard,
but
a
court
looking
at
the
same
evidence
can
reach
a
different
conclusion
about
what
is
on
the
label.
the
most
--
those
cases
i
believe
all
post-date
cipollone.
many
of
them
postdate
geier.
and
by
my
count,
there
are
fewer
than
20
such
cases
out
of
all
of
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
and
those
issues
--
that
issue
had
never
come
up
and
never
could
have
come
up
when
congress
enacted
the
1938
act,
because
it
was
only
the
1938
act
that
established
a
drug-specific,
preclearance
regime,
and
really
in
1962,
in
which
the
fda
was
required
not
just
to
evaluate
safety
in
terms
of
licensing
the
distribution
of
the
drug,
but
to
balance
safety
against
effectiveness.
and
so
the
--
the
constellation
of
common
law
cases
--
i
mean,
let
me
just
say
we
are
--
we
are
not
seeking
here
a
rule
of
field
preemption.
we
are
not
seeking
to
preclude
tort
remedies
for
conduct
that
violates
federal
law.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
--
and
this
goes,
i
think,
finally
to
your
point
about
the
express
pre-emption
clause
--
the
presence
of
expressed
pre-emption
clauses
or
the
absence,
the
presence
of
a
savings
clause
or
the
absence,
does
not
and
cannot
affect
the
operation
of
conflict
pre-emption
under
the
federal
constitution.
now,
members
of
this
court
are
concerned
about
applying
a
broad,
vague,
or
free-wheeling
analysis
of
implied
conflict
pre-emption,
but
this
case
is
heartland.
a
jury
was
asked
to
look
at
the
same
information
and
conclude
that
the
precise
language
that
the
fda
just
didn't
allow,
the
fda
required
wyeth
to
use,
rendered
that
drug
unreasonably
unsafe.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
liability
in
this
case
was
not
predicated
on
the
fact
that
wyeth
didn't
go
to
the
--
remember,
the
fda
had
approved
this
label
two
years
before
miss
levine
was
injured.
in
approving
the
label,
it
rejected
stronger
proposed
language
that
wyeth
had
presented.
there
was
nothing
that
was
--
wyeth
was--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
you
are
right.
we
--
we
have
both
an
impossibility
form
of
conflict
because,
in
the
absence
of
any
new
information
or
new
analyses
of
old
information,
we
could
not
make
the
change
in
advance
of
getting
approval.
and
we
also
have
an
--
an
objects-and-purposes
form
of
conflict
pre-emption
because
the
vermont
jury
decided
on
the
same
information
that
the
labeling
that
the
fda
had
approved
and
required
was
unreasonably
unsafe.
and
we
cannot
have
a
world
in
which
the
very
day
after
an
intensive
process
--
the
fda
says
you
may
distribute
this
drug,
but
you
must
use
this
specific
language
--
either,
a,
manufacturers
can
just
run
in
and
change
the
label
and
ask
for
permission
down
the
road;
or,
b,
that
a
state
jury
--
let's
take
the
easier
case
--
a
state
legislature
or
50
state
legislatures
can
decide:
because
you
could
have
gone
back
and
asked,
we
can
impose
an
obligation
on
you
that
you
must
have
done
so
or
must
have
changed
the
labeling.
that
just
is
inconsistent
with--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--either
a
negligence
theory
or
a
strict-liability
theory
would
be
pre-empted.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
make
--
i
do
want
to
go
to
--
make
a
preliminary
point
about
all
the
talk
about
misbranding
here.
the
statute
has
two
criminal
prohibitions.
one
is
misbranding,
which
is
the
original
1906
reactive
penalty.
if
the
fda
subsequently
finds
that
something
is
false
or
misleading,
it
can
come
after
you
for
misbranding.
but
this
case
involves
the
criminal
prohibition
against
distributing
drugs
for
which
there
is
not
an
approved,
effective
application.
and
that's
what's
at
stake
here.
now,
the
notion
that
there
was
any
--
any
misunderstanding
in
the
trial
court
about
whether
there
was
new
information
or
whether
there
was
--
there
were
incidents
that
the
fda
didn't
know
about,
or
it
didn't
evaluate
the
risk,
is
just
flat
wrong.
the
plaintiff
tried
this
--
the
plaintiff's
experts
said
the
fda
knew
about
this
risk.
wyeth
knew
about
this
risk
for
decades.
that
is
what
is
so
wrong.
that
is
why
he
stood
up
and
said
the
fda
doesn't
decide
this
question.
you
decide
this
question.
and
there
was
never,
ever
a
suggestion
in
the
record
in
this
case,
nor
could
there
have
been,
that
wyeth
ever
failed
to
bring
every
single
adverse-event
report
to
the
fda's
attention,
every
analysis
that
it
did
to
the
fda's
attention.
and
what
the
record
does
show
is
that
after
--
between
the
time
of
the
1955
approval
of
the
new-drug
application
and
the
1998
rejection
of
the
sdna,
the
supplemental
new
--
snda,
the
supplemental
new
drug
application,
that
did
have
more
extensive,
stronger
warnings
in
this
case,
wyeth
filed
five
--
and
these
are
all
in
the
joint
appendix
--
five
supplemental,
new-drug
applications,
each
one
asking
for
more
language,
more
warnings,
about
direct
iv
injection.
it's
not
called
"push".
it's
iv
injection
versus
drip,
which
is
a
gravity
method.
and,
in
fact,
mr.
frederick
says:
well,
you
know,
in
this
case
there
could
have
been
stronger
warnings,
and
that
--
and
this
case
wasn't
really
about
--
the
jury
wasn't
really
asked
to
--
it
didn't
really
say
that
the
label
had
to
contra
indicate
something
that
the
fda
labeling
required.
that
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
the
trial
lawyer
told
the
jury
at
opening
and
at
closing.
what
he
said
is
this
was
unreasonably
unsafe
because
it
didn't
say:
do
not
use
by
intravenous
administration.
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
warning
--
the
last
snda
which
we
submitted,
which
was
in
1987
and
is
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix
--
not
only
is
it
an
original,
but
there
is
a
typewritten
version
that
actually
has
the
text
in
the
type
size
that
one
can
actually
read.
at
the
summary-judgment
stage
that
the
pre-emption
issue
was
decided
--
may
i
finish
my
answer?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
summary
judgment
was
decided
at
the
--
pre-emption
was
decided
at
summary
judgment
before
trial.
so
there
was
no
evidence
about
what
was
new
or
wasn't
new.
in
ms.
levine's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
she
uses
the
word
"new"
information
about
labeling
change.
and,
with
respect
to
the
proposed
1987
language,
the
'88
change
that
we
asked
for,
she
said
--
and
i'm
reading
from
page
24
of
her
motion
for
summary
judgment
--
"in
1988,
wyeth
drafted
changes
to
the
warning
which
advised
that
the
use
of
a
free-flowing
iv
would
ensure
adequate
dilution
and
reduce
the
risk
of
arterial
injectia.
"
"although
not
strong
enough,
this
improved
the
labeling
instruction;
if
followed,
would
have
prevented
the
inadvertent
administration
of
phenergan
into
an
artery
for
the
reasons
described.
"
