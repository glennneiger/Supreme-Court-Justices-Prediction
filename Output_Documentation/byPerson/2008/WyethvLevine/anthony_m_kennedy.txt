justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
at
the
outset,
i'll
just
make
one
comment.
you
argue
that
it's
impossible
for
wyeth
to
comply
with
the
state
law
and
at
the
same
time
the
federal
label.
as
a
textual
matter,
as
a
logical
matter,
i
just
--
i
don't
understand
that.
i
think
i
could
design
a
label
that's
completely
consistent
and
that
meets
the
requirements
that
the
respondents
wish
to
urge.
now,
if
you
want
to
say
that
any
alteration
of
the
label
violates
federal
law,
that's
something
else.
but
as
a
textual
matter,
as
a
logical
matter,
as
a
semantic
matter,
i
don't
agree
with
it.

the
fda
was
never
concerned
with
risks
versus
benefit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
understand
what
we're
talking
about
here.
the
new
information
was
not
brought
up
by
either
side--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--showing
increased
frequency
or
increased
severity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right?
and
supposedly,
it
was
burden
of
the
drug
company
to
show--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
agree
with
--
you
agree
with
mr.
waxman
that
the
fda
specifically
addressed
the
risks
and
benefits
of
iv
push
as
opposed
to
the
risks
of
arterial
exposures?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
talking
about
changing
but
you
can
supplement
without
changing
the
label.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
conclude
that
new
information
is
the
criterion
for
deciding
this
case,
if
we
reject
the
argument
that
misbranding
at
the
outset
allows
state
law
to
supplement
the
duty,
but
that
if
there's
new
information,
then
the
label
has
to
be
changed
--
if
it
that's
the
line
we
draw,
can
this
verdict
be
sustained?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
vermont
court's
opinion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
to
put
the
burden
on
the
manufacturer
seems
to
me
inconsistent
with
what
10
states
have
said,
that
there
is
a
rebuttable
presumption
and
inconsistent
also
with
the
instructions
the
jury
received
in
this
case,
that
you
can
consider
the
fda
label.
so,
i
think,
to
me,
what
you
say
there
is
not
borne
out
by
what
happened
in
this
case
or
by
those
other
states'--
