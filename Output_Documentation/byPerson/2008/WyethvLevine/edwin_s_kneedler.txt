mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
law
duties
on
which
respondent's
tort
claims
are
based
are
pre-empted
because
they
conflict
with
the
fda's
determination
that
phenergan
injection
is
safe
and
effective
under
the
conditions
of
use
recommended
or
suggested
in
the
labeling.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
--
the
fda,
to
my
knowledge,
has
never
taken
the
position
that
--
that,
as
a
general
matter,
a
manufacturer
may
change
a
label
without
--
without
the
existence
of
new
information
that
justifies
a
revision.
the
respondents
and
the
amici
relied
primarily
on
some
snippets
of
rule-making
proceedings
and
things
like
that
in
which
fda
has
referred
to
the
existence
of
tort
remedies.
but
we
are
not
arguing
for
the
proposition
that
tort
remedies
are
--
are
pre-empted
as
a
general
matter.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
as
mr.
waxman
mentioned,
if
--
if
the
state
standard
was
the
same
as
the
federal
standard,
there
wouldn't
be
any
conflict.
and,
for
example,
if
--
and
not
to
mention
the
fact
if
there
was
adulteration
of
--
of
the
product
or
if
the
--
if
the
product
in
the
box
was
not
the
same--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
position
we
are
arguing
for
here
would
not
cover
that
situation,
but
--
but
there
could
be
a
further
situation
of
pre-emption,
if
i
could
just
explain
why.
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
if
you
--
if
you
failed
to
provide
it
altogether,
there
would
not
be
a
--
a
pre-emption
defense
if
there
were
--
if
your
failure-to-warn
claim
was
based
on
the
new
information
that
you
didn't
furnish.
i
was
--
i
was
going
to
identify
the
situation
where
--
and
this
has
come
up
in
the
antidepressant
drug
situation,
for
example,
where
there
is
evolving
information.
there
has
been
a
rule-making
petition,
in
fact
several
over
the
years,
to
the
fda
to
change
the
labeling
to
warn
against
--
to
warn
about
the
possibility
of
suicidal
ideation.
and
fda
has
rejected
that
even
though
it's
--
it's
new
information
arising
after
the
drug
was
approved.
if
the
information
is
brought
to
the
fda's
attention
and
fda
rejects
the
proposed
change,
then
you
would
you
have
conflict
pre-emption
again.
but
if
the
information
was
never
brought
to
the
fda's
attention
in
the
first
place,
then
--
then
there
would
--
it
would
be
not
inconsistent
with
federal
law
to
have
a
tort
suit
based
on
that.
if
it's
--
if
it's
been
proposed
and
rejected,
then
you're
back
with
a
conflict.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
you
would
be
authorized,
but
if
fda
then
rejects
--
rejects
the
labeling--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
--
if
--
if
fda
has
taken
no
action
at
all,
then
i
think
you
--
you
could
be.
i
this
it's
very
likely
that
fda
would
have
acted
by
the
--
by
the
time
that
--
i
mean,
i
suppose
there
could
be
a
window
in
there
before
it
was
approved.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
i
could
make
two
points
about
that:
the
first
is,
as
i
said,
we
are
not
arguing
that
there
is
pre-emption
in
a
situation
where
there
is
new
information
that
is
not
brought
to
fda's
attention.
but
the
second
point
is
that
in
the
2007
amendments
to
the
act,
congress
recognized
the
difficulties
with
this
and
gave
fda
important
new
enforcement
tools
and
resources
to
go
after
the
problem
of
things
that
arise
after
a
drug
is
improved
--
approved,
that
has
given
fda
the
authority
to
direct
a
change
in
the
label,
which
it
did
not
have
before.
it
has
given
the
fda
the
authority
to
order
new
clinical
studies,
and
it
has
ordered
fda
to
set
up
a
data
system
where
it
will
get
electronic
notification
of
--
of
adverse
events.
i
--
i
should
point
out
in
the
--
in
the
one
year
since
these
amendments
were
passed,
fda
has,
i
--
i
think,
in
21
instances
ordered
clinical
trials.
in
four
instances
it
has
ordered
a
revision
of
labeling.
it
has
hired
430
new
employees
in
the
center
for
drug
evaluation
and
research
to
address
the
post-marketing
situation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
risk
--
the
way
fda
--
and
this
is
set
forth
in
the
changes
being
affected
regulation
amendment
that
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
--
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
fda
explained
in
2008,
when
it
promulgated
this
regulation,
it's
been
fda's
long-standing
interpretation
that
only
new
information
would
justify
a
change.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
new
information
means
new
information
about
a
risk
that
is
greater
in
severity
or
frequency.
if
you
have--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
is
no
claim
--
there
is
no
claim
here
that
either
of
those
--
in
the
record
in
this
case,
that
either
of
those
was
true.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
a
legal
question
not
a
factual
one.
and
it
was
argued
to
the
vermont--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
was
argued
to
the
vermont
supreme
court,
and
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
respondent
--
respondent
has
noted
that
it
wasn't
raised,
but
i
don't
think
it's
argued
that
it's
waived.
and
i
think
for
the
court
to
fully
address
this
situation,
i
think
it
would
be
good
to
take
into
account
fda's
--
certainly
going
forward
that
is
the
regulatory
regime--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--okay.
if
i
could
make
just
one
further--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
i
could
make
one
further
point
about
that.
and
that
is
the
--
this
act
sets
up
a
prior
approval
situation.
in
other
words,
congress
wanted
the
fda
to
look
at
the
drug
in
advance,
balance
--
against
benefits
as
this
court
said
in
rutherford,
and
--
brown
&
williamson,
strike
a
balance
and
approve
it.
it
would
be
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
a
prior
approval
system
to
have
a
regime
in
which
the
very
next
day
state
law
could
require
the
manufacturer
to
change
the
very
labeling
that
fda
has
struck
a
balance--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
the
drug
company
says
it's
pre-empted,
and
the
only
escape
hatch
from
the
preemption
is
new
information.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
specifically
addressed
in
the
labeling
that
the
fda
approved,
and
i
think
that's
all
that
needs
to
be
looked
at
in
--
it's
just
as
in
riegle,
where
the
preemption
turns
on
that
device,
in
that
case,
and
the
labeling
that
was
presented.
here
the
preemption
turns
on
the
labeling
and
the
drug
that
was
presented.
and
fda
regulations
prohibit
the
change
unless
there
is
new
information.
if
i
could
make
one
other
point
about
riegle.
riegle
does
contain
an
fda
--
an
expressed
preemption
provision.
but
the
reason
why
this
court
found
preemption
in
riegle
under
that
provision
is
very
instructive
here,
because
as
mr.
waxman
pointed
out,
the
premarket
approval
process
in
the
two
situations
are
essentially
the
same.
and
what
you
had
on
the
one
hand
was
federal
action
having
the
force
of
law
like
under
the
file
rate
doctrine
or
some
administrative
determination
having
the
force
of
law
approving
a
license
or
--
or
a
drug,
a
legal
prohibition
against
changing
that
without
new
information.
and
on
the
state
side,
you
have
a
rule
of
law
under
the
common
law
of
torts
imposing
a
different
obligation.
those
are
squarely
termed--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no
--
no,
you
cannot.
any
--
any
change
in
the
wording
of
--
of
the
label
is
a
change
that
requires
fda
approval
unless
it
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--when
there
is
new
information
and
even
then,
it
has
to
be
in
the
form
of
a
new
drug
--
a
supplemental
drug
application
to
the
agency.
