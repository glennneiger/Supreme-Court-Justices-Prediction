--it
didn't
say
--
it
didn't
say
iv
across
the
board.
it
said
iv
push
is
the
claim,
and
that
was
--
as
i
understand
this,
the
fda
was
aware
of
the
iv
use
and
a
certain
risk.
but
did
it
ever,
ever
discreetly
consider
iv
push
versus
iv
administered
the
usual
way
by
a
drip
bag?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
was
it
--
the
risk
of
gangrene
and
amputation
is
there.
no
matter
what
benefit
there
was,
how
could
the
benefit
outweigh
that
substantial
risk?
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
kneedler,
at
the
outset,
would
you
clarify
something
that
is
central,
i
think,
to
this
case?
some
of
the
briefs
tell
us
that
this
represents
a
change
of
policy
on
the
part
of
the
fda,
that
in
fact
the
fda
once
approved
and
said
torts
were
--
tort
suits
were
a
helpful
adjunct
to
the
fda's
own
efforts
to
protect
consumers.
they
helped
because
they
prodded
manufacturers
to
--
to
disclose
risks
that
were
either
unknown
or
under-evaluated.
was
that
once
the
fda's
policy;
and,
if
so,
when
did
it
change?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
is
that
--
why
is
that
likely,
considering
the
huge
number
of
drugs?
i
mean,
one
figure
said
that
there
are
11,000
drugs
that
have
this
approval.
is
the
fda
really
monitoring
every
one
of
those
to
see
if
there
is
some
new
information
that
should
change
the
label?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
--
can
you
turn
to
the
references
that
mr.
waxman
and
mr.
kneedler
made?
they
said
oh,
yes,
iv
push
was
considered
discretely
from
iv
drip
bags.
