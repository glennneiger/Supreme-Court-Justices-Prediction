justice

scalia
but
when
--
when
would
there
be
a
tort
remedy?
what
--
what
situation
would
you
envision?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
they
found
out
about
new
information
which
would,
if
properly
considered,
alter
what
the
labeling
ought
to
be?
would
there
be
a
tort
remedy
for
the
failure
to
bring
that
new
information
to
the
attention
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
mean
if
you
failed
to
provide
the
fda
the
new
information
that
you
think
negates
the
provisions
on
the
--
on
the
label,
you
still
couldn't
be
sued?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
--
what
if
you
brought
it
to
the
fda's
attention
and
the
fda
just
hasn't
acted
on
it?
you
would
be
authorized
to
change
the
label
on
your
own.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
in
the
interim,
you
could
--
could
you
be
subject
to
a
state
tort
suit
for
not
changing
the
label
when
--
when
you
had
the
power
to
do
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
supplement
only
when
there
is
new
information?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
those
--
those
risks
were
set
forth
on
the
labeling
approved
by
the
fda.
surely
that
sentence
means
it
shall
be
revised
to
include
a
warning
as
soon,
as
soon
as
there
is
reasonable
evidence
of
an
association
of
a
serious
hazard
that
the
fda
has
not
considered.
and
that
is
not
already
addressed
on
the
labeling.
i
mean
to
read
it
as
--
as
opening
up
stuff
that's
already
been
considered
by
the
fda
would
--
would
--
would
make
a
--
a
mush
out
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
just
contradicting
the
labeling.
the
fact
is
they
could
not
have
approved
that
label
unless
they
made
that
determination.
now,
if
you're
telling
me
the
fda
acted
irresponsible
--
irresponsibly,
then
sue
the
fda.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
labeling
made
it
very
clear
that
the
preferred
method
of
administering
this
medicine
was
--
was
--
was
muscular
and
--
and
that
there
were
serious
risks
involved
in
--
in
the
iv
push.
moreover,
your
client
didn't
follow
the
labeling
or
your
client's
physician
didn't
follow
the
labeling
prescription
for
iv
push,
did
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
wait,
wait.
he
administered
a
--
a
level
of
the
drug
that
was
vastly
in
excess
of
--
of
--
of
what
the
labeling
said
could
safely
be
used
for
iv
push.
justice
antonin
scalia
had
no
bearing.
are
you
serious?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
established
that
there
were
new
problems?
i
mean,
if
there
were
new
problems,
then
--
then
they
could
have
simply
supplemented
the
labeling.
but
did
you
establish
that
there
were
problems
that
had
not
been
considered
already
by
the
fda?
i
mean,
the
labeling
says,
you
know,
that
this
is
dangerous
to
use
--
use
iv
push.
it
made
it
very
clear
that
it's
dangerous.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
proposed
a
more
restrictive
label
to
the
fda,
didn't
it?
and
the
fda
said,
no,
you
use
this
label.
in
other
words,
it's
--
what
you're
saying
was
not
its
call.
it
was
the
call
of
the
fda.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it
referred
to
new
drug
risks,
then,
in
your
preceding
sentence,
where
you
are
saying
manufacturers
change
it
all
the
time
as
new
drug
risks
become
apparent?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you
mean
is
whether
or
not
new
drug
risks
become
apparent,
they
have
to
change,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
is
entitled
to
amend
the
labeling
automatically.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
envision
a
--
a
scheme
under
which
manufacturers
who
are
worried
about
jury
liability
of
--
of
the
magnitude
that
occurred
in
this
case
saying,
gee,
why
should
we
take
chances?
and
every
time
there
is
a
jury
verdict
on
some
--
on
some
other
--
some
other
ground
not
--
not
prohibited
by
the
label,
they
just
add
that
to
the
label;
and
they
submit
it
to
--
to
the
fda
and
the
--
and
until
--
unless
and
until
the
fda
conducts
an
investigation
and
disapproves
that
label,
that
labeling
change
occurs.
how
many
--
how
many
--
you
mentioned
a
number
of
--
of
times
that
--
that
label
alterations
are
--
are
proposed.
i
mean,
this
is
going
to
be
a
massive
operation
for
the
fda.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
not
promote
public
safety
if
you
believe
that
the
name
of
this
game
is
balancing
benefits
and
costs.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
you
are
simply
eliminating
certain
drugs
which
people
who
--
who
have
real
desperate
need
for
could
--
could
be
benefited
by,
you're
not
benefiting
the
public.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
applies
even
if
it's
approved
by
the
fda?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
fda
approval
doesn't
--
doesn't
give
you
any
protection
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
--
but
the
marketing
may
be
a
misbranding?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
gee,
then
all
of
the
qualifications
you
were
making
earlier
about
whether
it's
new
information
or
a
new
assessment,
that's
irrelevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
whenever
it's
unsafe,
whatever
the
fda
has
approved,
you
have
a
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
--
there
was
nothing
about
new
information
in
what
you
just
said.
you
said
it's
misbranded
if
it's
not
safe,
new
information
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
--
is
that
--
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
a
fair
statement
then
you
have
to
retract
your
--
your
earlier
assertion
that
whenever
it's
not
safe
it's
misbranded.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
it?
whenever
it's
not
safe,
it's
misbranded,
or
what
you
just
responded
to
justice
souter?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
label
doesn't.
i
mean,
the
label
ask
discusses
the
high
risk
from
iv
push
and
sets
forth
particular
cautions
for
that
--
for
that
specific
means
of
administration.
