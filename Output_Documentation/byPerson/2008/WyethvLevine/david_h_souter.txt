justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
required
it
because
that
is
what
the
fda
had
approved
as
a
label.
but
as
--
excuse
me
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
--
the
company,
wyeth,
could
have
gone
back
to
the
fda
at
any
time
and
said,
either
based
on
experience
or
just
our
rethinking
of
the
data
that
we
have,
we
think
the
label
ought
to
be
changed
to
say
iv
push>
["].
wyeth
could
have
done
that
at
any
time,
and
it
simply
didn't
do
it.
and
the
--
the
reason
i
raise
this
is
because
it
could
have
done
it
at
any
time,
where,
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
first
question,
where
is
the
conflict?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
as
i
understand
it,
wyeth's
argument
is
not
this
argument.
wyeth
is
not
saying
the
reason
there
is
a
conflict
here
is
that
we
tried
to
give
the
kind
of
warning
that
the
vermont
jury,
in
effect,
says
we
should
have
given
and
the
fda
didn't
allow
us
to
do
it,
so
that,
in
fact,
there
is
a
conflict
between
a
specific
rejection
by
the
fda
of
the
vermont
rule
and
the
rule
that
the
vermont
jury
applied.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
understand
it,
wyeth's
argument
is:
whatever
is
on
the
label,
in
fact,
is
the
standard
of
conflict.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
we
tried
or
could
have
tried
or
didn't
try.
you
simply
look
at
the
label
and
you
look
at
what
the
vermont
jury
did;
and
if
there
is
a
--
if
there
is
a
difference
between
them,
there
is
a
conflict.
am
i
right
about
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
--
is
it
strict
liability
or
negligence?
in
other
words,
are
they
saying
you
must
have
done
so,
or
are
they
saying
because
you
could
have
done
so
and
didn't
you
did
not
conform
to
the
standard
of
care?
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect
to
the
obligation
in
this
case,
may
i
go
back
to
an
earlier
question
that
justice
scalia
asked
you?
and
i
--
i
--
if
you
responded
to
this
particular
point,
i
didn't
get
it.
he
said
that
he
understood
that
wyeth
had
in
fact
asked
the
fda
to
modify
the
label,
at
least
to
strengthen
the
warning
against
iv
push,
and
that
request
was
--
was
denied,
so
that
in
fact
that
--
that
created
the
conflict.
what
is
your
response
to
--
to
the
factual
basis
for
that
--
for
that
comment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
regardless
of
what
their,
their
semantic
label
was,
was
there
a
request
at
least
to
--
to
beef
up
the
warning
against
using
iv
push?
and
if
so,
did
the
--
did
the
fda
reject
it
and
say
no,
you
can't
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
would
it
have
said?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
--
you
also,
to
be
clear
on
it,
as
i
understand
it,
you
do
not
accept
the
position
that
the
fda
puts
forward,
that
the
obligation
depends
upon
the
accrual
of
new
information.
justice
david
h.
souter
any
information,
new
or
old,
as
i
understand
it,
on
your
argument
raises
this
obligation
to
--
to
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
getting
to
justice
scalia's
point,
as
i
understand
your
answer
to
an
earlier
question,
on
the
day
that
the
fda
approves
the
label,
if
there
is
no
further
information
indicating
danger,
then
any
liability
that
is
based
upon
what
the
--
the
kind
of
information
that
the
fda
knew
would
be
pre-empted.
the
only
time
--
you're
saying
pre-emption
does
not
occur
when
there
is
--
forget
the
word
fda
was
told,
whether
it's
1,000
years
old
or
discovered
yesterday;
and
if
there
is
liability
predicated
on
further
information
beyond
what
the
fda
was
told,
then
there
is
not
pre-emption.
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
if
--
if
the
so-called
misbranding
is
determined
to
be
misbranding,
based
upon
information
which
was
given
to
the
fda,
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
would
admit
that
there
was
pre-emption.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
there--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
other
words,
there
is
that
one
exception
at
least
to
the
broad
statement
that
you
gave
in
answer
to
justice
scalia?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
--
but
the
misbranding
is
of
no
consequence
to
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
i
think
you're
saying
if
there
--
if
there
would
be
pre-emption
it
may
be
misbranded,
but
there
cannot
be
any
recovery
in
a
state
tort
suit.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
misbranding
under
those
circumstances
is
a
purely
theoretical
concept.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
your
argument
that
they
couldn't
have
considered
these
comparative
risks,
because
if
they
had,
they
would
have
come
out
differently;
because
they
didn't
come
out
differently,
we
have
to
infer
that
they
didn't
consider
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--apart
from
your
analysis
that
they
couldn't
have
or
they
would
have
come
out
differently,
how
did
we
know
that
they
didn't
consider
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
do
these
--
when
you
say
"communications",
do
you
mean
starting
with
the
original
application
for
approval
of
the
label?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
you
are
saying
all
the
correspondence
that
we
do
know
about,
that
is
extant,
fails
to
mention
comparative
risk.
