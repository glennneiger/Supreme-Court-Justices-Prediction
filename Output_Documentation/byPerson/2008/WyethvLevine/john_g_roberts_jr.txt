chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-1249,
wyeth
v.
levine.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'd
like
you
to
address
the
distinction
between
the
medical
device
area
and
the
drug
area
because
in
the
medical
device
area,
of
course,
you
have
an
express
pre-emption
clause,
while
here
in
contrast
you
don't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
that's
true
you
would
have
expected
the
federal
drug
act
to
have
a
similar
express
pre-emption
provision.
and
one
reason
perhaps
that
it
didn't
is
that
when
the
drug
act
was
passed
you
had
an
established
background
of
state
actions;
when
the
medical
device
act
was
passed
you
didn't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
various
portions
of
the
label
in
the
record
that
mr.
waxman
addressed
and
mr.
kneedler,
representing
the
fda,
said
they
specifically
considered
iv
push
risks?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
have
to.
when
they
determine
that
it's
safe
to
use
it
under
those
circumstances
that
necessarily
includes
a
consideration
of
the
risk.
people
can
say
it's
safe
for
you
to
walk
down
the
sidewalk.
that
doesn't
mean
there
is
no
risk
that
you
get
hit
by
lightning
or
something
else.
it
just
means
in
evaluating
them
together,
they
determine
that
it's
worth
the
candle
in
particular
cases
where
a
physician
determines
that
that's
the
indicated
method.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
--
i
thought
your
theory
was
that
this
type
of
administration
of
the
drug
should
not
be
allowed.
the
label
should
not
say
here
are
the
risks,
here
are
the
benefits.
you
--
your
jury
theory
was
you
cannot
suggest
in
the
labeling
that
physicians
should
have
this
available.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
simply
says
that
if
you
go
ahead
with
the
label
like
this,
you
don't
have
to
pay
$10
million
whenever
it
goes
wrong.
that's
having
the
effect,
as
our
case
has
established,
imposing
a
limitation
on
the
label.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
case
depends
upon
us
determining
that
the
risk
at
issue
here
that
was
presented
to
the
jury
was
a
new
risk
that
the
fda
did
not
consider?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
suppose--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
now,
your
friends
on
the
other
side
said
there
was
specific
consideration
of
iv
push
as
opposed
to
simply
arterial
exposure,
and
that
that
is
laid
forth
in
the
labeling.
so,
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
be,
all
we
have
to
do
is
simply
look
at
the
record,
and
if
we
think
the
fda
considered
specifically
iv
push
risks
as
opposed
to
general
arterial
exposure,
then
you
lose,
and
if
we
determine
that
they
did
not,
then
they
lose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
if
the
vermont
supreme
court
was
emphatic
about
it.
i
mean,
the
record
is
either
--
addresses
the
fda
--
i'm
more
interested
in
what
the
fda
was
emphatic
about,
and
they
either
address
iv
push
separately
or
they
don't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
waxman,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
today
in
case
06-1249,
wyeth
versus
levine.
