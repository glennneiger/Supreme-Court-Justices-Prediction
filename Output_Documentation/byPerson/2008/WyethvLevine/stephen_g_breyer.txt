justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
--
why
isn't
the
fact
that
some
certain
number
of
people
are
getting
gangrene,
why
isn't
that
new
information?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
all
passed
long
after
the
events
here
took
place,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
at
the
time,
you
read
the
regulation,
i
think
a
person
would
think
that
he
was
free
drug
manufacturer
if
he
learned
something
new
to
strengthen
--
strengthens
the
contraindication,
put
it
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
wouldn't
that
be
new?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
get
a
certain
number
of
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
because
nobody
brought
up
this
new
information
point.
so
if
nobody
brought
up
the
new
information
point
at
the
trial
and
if
the
burden
is
on
the
manufacturer
to
show
that
it's
pre-empted,
isn't
that
the
manufacturer's
fault,
because
if
you
simply
read
the
regulation,
you
wouldn't
find
any
of
all
this
complicated
stuff
about
certain
kinds
of
new
information.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes
it's
a
legal
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we
are
not
making
an
advisory
opinion.
we
are
deciding
this
case.
and
this
case
here
you
say
new
information
of
a
certain
kind
would
be
okay,
nobody
argued
it.
you
read
the
reg,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
all
these
distinctions
end
of
case.
since
the
manufacturer
has
the
burden
of
going
into
this,
which
apparently
it
didn't
do.
so,
now
we
have
decided
this
case,
and
we
go
on
to
the
next
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
--
the
part
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is
this:
suppose
it
was
before
trial.
i
don't
care,
before
or
after.
the
plaintiff
comes
in
with
a
claim.
all
right.
manufacturer:
that's
pre-empted.
the
claim
is
that
you
should
have
told
the
fda
and
added
something
to
your
label.
manufacturer:
that's
preempted.
plaintiff:
well,
you
haven't
read
this
reg
here.
the
reg
here
which
has
been
in
existence
since
1965
says
that
we
can
go
and
add
something.
i
mean
you
can
go
and
add
something
to
show
a
contra
indication,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
now,
in
fact,
30
years
later,
i
guess,
without
the
horrible
things
happening
that
justice
scalia
mentioned,
or
maybe
they
did
--
i
don't
know.
but
30
years
later
the
fda
makes
another
mention
of
new
information.
i
take
it
that's
in
1982.
that's
the
first
time
that
happened.
now,
if
i'm
right
about
that,
what
happens
when
no
one
says
a
word
about
that?
of
course,
if
the
manufacturer
had
said
something
about
that,
then
maybe
the
plaintiff
would
have
said:
and
it
was
new.
it
was
new,
but
the
manufacturer
doesn't
say
a
word.
are
you
following
what
i'm
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i'm
wondering
still
what
happens.
i
believe
what
happened
here
is
that
in
the
argument
in
the
lower
courts,
in
the
trial
court,
nobody
said
anything
about
the
fda's
claim
that
the
information
necessary
to
just
go
ahead
and
change
the
label
had
to
be
new.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
--
and
i
don't
know
if
"burden
of
proof"
is
the
right
word
--
where
nobody
says
a
word
about
it,
who
wins?
if
they
had
said
a
word
about
it,
you
need
new
information,
maybe
the
manufacturer
--
the
plaintiff
could
have
shown
that
the
manufacturer
had
new
information.
