justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
frederick,
i'd
like
to
put
the
misbranding
point
to
one
side
and
just
concentrate
on
pre-emption.
and
i
understood
you
to
agree
with
justice
alito
that
there
is
a
hypothetical
case
in
which
there
would
be
pre-emption,
and
would
you
tell
me
what
particular
fact
distinguishes
your
case
from
his
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this:
when
did
the
duty
on
the
part
of
wyeth
to
have
a
different
label
arise,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
it
arise
before
or
after
submitting
the
original
drug
application?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
boil
down
to
a
claim
that
there
was
new
information
that
was
available
between
the
original
approval
and
the
time
of
the
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
either
one.
but
is
your
theory
really
a
theory
based
on
new
information
or
new
judgment
about
old
information?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
april
2000,
diana
levine
sought
treatment
for
a
migraine
headache
at
her
local
health
center.
a
clinician
gave
her
a
direct
injection
of
phenergan,
an
antinausea
drug
manufactured
by
wyeth.
after
the
drug
entered
her
artery,
levine
developed
gangrene
and
doctors
amputated
her
forearm.
levine
brought
a
state
law
damages
action
alleging
that
wyeth
had
failed
to
provide
an
adequate
warning
about
the
risk
of
directly
injecting
phenergan
into
a
patient's
vein.
the
vermont
jury
found
that
levine's
injury
would
have
not
occurred
if
phenergan's
label
included
an
adequate
warning
and
had
awarded
her
damages.
wyeth
then
sought
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
arguing
that
levine's
claims
were
preempted
by
federal
law
because
phenergan's
labeling
had
been
approved
by
the
federal
food
and
drug
administration.
the
trial
court
rejected
wyeth's
presumption
argument
and
the
vermont
supreme
court
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
wyeth's
argument
that
the
fda's
approval
of
phenergan's
label
preempts
levine's
state
law
claims.
we
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
vermont
supreme
court.
we
reject
wyeth's
argument
that
it
is
impossible
for
it
to
comply
with
both
the
state
law
duties
underlying
levine's
claims
and
its
federal
labeling
duties.
generally,
a
manufacturer
may
only
change
its
drug
label
after
receiving
the
fda's
approval.
but
the
agency
has
a
regulation
that
permits
manufacturers
to
make
certain
unilateral
labeling
changes
to
enhance
drug
safety.
under
this
regulation,
wyeth
could
have
added
a
stronger
warning
about
direct
injection
of
phenergan
and
thereby
complied
with
both
its
state
law
and
federal
law
duties.
we
also
reject
wyeth's
argument
that
levine's
state
law
claims
posed
an
obstacle
to
congress'
purpose
of
entrusting
an
expert
agency
with
drug
labeling
decisions.
the
history
of
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
shows
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
preempt
state
law
failure
to
warn
actions
and
wyeth's
reliance
under
a
preamble
to
a
2006
fda
regulation
is
unpersuasive.
this
preamble
is
not
an
agency
regulation
with
the
force
of
law.
and
congress
has
not
expressly
authorized
the
fda
to
preempt
state
law.
we
do
not
defer
to
the
fda's
mere
assertion
that
state
law
is
an
obstacle
to
achieving
its
statutory
objections.
among
other
problems,
the
2006
preamble
does
not
sufficiently
explain
fda's
departure
from
its
longstanding
position
that
state
law
is
a
complementary
form
of
federal
--
of
drug
regulation.
we
therefore
hold
the
fda's
approval
of
phenergan's
labeling
does
not
preempt
levine's
state
law
failure
to
warn
claim.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
have
joined.
