justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
are
saying
that
635(a)
creates
an
inference
that
635(c)
creates
the
fiduciary
duty?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
part
i'm
not
getting.
you
are
saying
--
the
question,
i
guess,
basically
is,
does
the
language
of
635(a)
which
says
"with
the
approval
of
the
secretary--
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
indians
can,
among
other
things,
for
business
purposes
lease
the
land.
right?
that's
what
it
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
doesn't
seem
much
different
from
the
imla,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
to
me.
it
doesn't
seem
different
at
all.
so
now
you
are
saying,
no,
it's
really
different
because
look
at
(b)
and
(c).
that's
your
basic
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
look
at
(b)
and
(c)
and
it
says,
well,
when
you
lease
something
under
(b)
and
(c),
which
is
not
(a)
--
it's
(b)
and
(c)
--
you
have
to
have
all
this
supervision
and
so
forth,
or
it
has
to
be
at
a
fair
value,
something
like
that;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
(b)
and
(c)
say
that
land
is
owned
in
fee
but,
let's
see
--
what
is
--
sorry,
i
don't
want
to
delay
you
on
this.
i
thought
that
(b)
and
(c)
you
were
saying
create
an
obligation
--
create
more
of
a
trust
obligation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
does
that
--
why
does
that
mean
that
this
act
creates
a
trust
relationship?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you,
but
now
what
of
course
is
at
the
back
of
my
mind
is
i'm
trying
to
see,
is
this
--
is
this
statute
stronger
for
you
than
the
statute
we
already
considered?
and
i
start
with
some
suspicion,
because
i
think
if
it
was
a
stronger
statute
for
you,
you
would
have
argued
it
the
last
time.
so
i
wonder
why
you
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
somebody
thought
maybe
it
was
a
weaker
statute,
so
--
but
i
will
put
that
suspicion
aside.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
the
fundamental
question
in
my
mind.
i
look
at
the
language
and
so
forth.
the
language
doesn't
seem
any
stronger
for
you,
at
least
at
first
blush.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
isn't
really
my
question,
because
i've
tried
to
erase
from
my
mind
any
suspicion
about
why
you
did
or
didn't
argue
it
last
time.
and
looking
at
it
straight
afresh,
i
think
when
the
court
of
claims
got
this
back,
as
any
judge
would,
the
first
thing
they
do
is
look
at
the
words
of
the
old
statute,
look
at
the
words
of
the
new
statute,
and
try
to
figure
out
if
the
new
statute
that
you
cited
is
somehow
more
supportive
of
your
claim
than
the
old
one
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
what
have
we
got
here
in
that
respect?
what
we
seem
to
have
is
two
later
provisions
that
say
the
government
will
have
no
liability
when
it
enters
into
leases.
i
mean,
maybe
that
helps
you,
but
at
the
moment
i
am
slightly
escaping
it.
and
then
i
guess
there
are
some
regs
that
were
promulgated
after
the
lease
was
entered
into
and
seem
on
their
face
to
deal
with
other
matters.
okay,
now,
what
am
i
missing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
the
regs
you
didn't
emphasize,
so
forget
them.
if
you
don't
want
to
rely
on
them,
we
won't.
the
--
but
i've
looked
for
everything
i
could
find
that
would
support
you
on
this
basis--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
there
you
are,
so
i
want
you
to
add
something
to
explain--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
