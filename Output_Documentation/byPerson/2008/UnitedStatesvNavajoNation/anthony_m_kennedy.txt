are
there
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
where
indian
tribes
litigate
with
the
secretary
and
claim
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
way
in
which
the
secretary
performs
the
duties
with
respect
to
indian
lands?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
--
i
recognize
that,
but
i
want
to
know,
is
there
a
body
of
law
in
the
federal
circuit
that
generally
recognizes
that
the
--
that
the
secretary
has
a
fiduciary
obligation
that's
enforceable
as
a
matter
of
administrative
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
meant
all
of
the
circuits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
what
i
was
asking
was
whether
there's
some
doctrine
that
the
--
that
the
trustee
--
that
the
secretary
acts
in
a
capacity,
a
fiduciary
capacity
as
a
trustee.
if
that
doctrine
were
out
there,
then
that
might
be
the
basis
for
saying
that
it's
a
sufficient
foundation
for
money
damages.
i
was
just
asking,
is
that
doctrine
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
give
me
an
--
and
incidentally,
the
statute
is
in
opposition
brief,
or
the
orange
brief,
at
page
5.
give
me
an
example
of
why
the
last
clause,
"and
such
disposition
shall
create
no
liability
on
the
part
of
the
united
states.
"
--what
contingency
was
that
directed
to
if
not
the
one
that
is
before
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
it
says
"the
development
or
utilization
of
natural
resources.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
why
isn't
it
a
public
purpose
to
develop
indian
minerals?
that
benefits
the
indians
and
the
whole
public.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no,
it
says
"public".
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
even
if
--
if
i
may
have
just
one
minute,
justice
souter.
if
you
get
revenue
from
the
natural
resources,
why
isn't
that
a
public,
religious,
educational
purpose?
they
get
revenue
from
leasing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
just
--
i
just
think
you
give
too
cramped
a
reading
to
section
5.
