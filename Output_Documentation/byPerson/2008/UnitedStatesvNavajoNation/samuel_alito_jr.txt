well,
under
the
rehabilitation
act,
if
it
applied
to
this
lease,
what
would
the
secretary's
duty
be?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

the
secretary
has
to
apply
some
standard,
presumably.
what
is
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
your
position
--
is
it
your
position
that
it
would
be
--
that
it
--
it
is
not
lawful
for
coal
on
the
navajo
reservation
to
be
leased
under
imla;
a
lease
would
have
to
be
solely
under
section
5
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
justice
samuel

but
the
lease
--
the
lease
doesn't
follow
the
--
the
requirements
of
section
5
of
the
rehabilitation
act
in
--
in
respect
to
its
term.
but
what
is
your
--
is
it
your
position
that
in
entering
into
a
lease
the
tribe
has
the
authority
to
decide,
we
want
this
to
be
under
imla,
we
want
this
to
be
under
the
rehabilitation
act?
when
it
comes
up
to
the
secretary
for
approval,
does
the
secretary
have
the
authority
to
say,
i'm
going
to
approve
this
under
imla;
i'm
going
to
approve
it
under--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i
thought
that
your
argument
earlier
was
that
all
leases
of
mineral
rights
on
the
navajo-hopi
land
are
governed
by
the
rehabilitation
act,
and
it's
not
a
factual
question
as
to
which
statute
anybody
chose
at
the
time
of
the
negotiation
of
the
lease.
but
recently,
in
the
last
few
minutes,
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
it
was
a
factual
issue
that
was
--
that
was
unearthed
only
through
later
discovery.
