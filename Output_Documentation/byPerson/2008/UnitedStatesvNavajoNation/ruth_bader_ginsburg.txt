but
the
question--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
question
presented,
general
kneedler,
was
limited
to
imla,
to
the
mineral
leasing
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
was
the
government's
question
presented.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
kneedler,
the
last
time
--
the
last
time
around,
we
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
would
you
advocate
a
different
bottom
line
this
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
phillips,
i'm
looking
at
the
last
paragraph
in
the
opinion.
it
said:
"we
have
no
warrant
from
any
relevant
statute
or
regulation.
"
et
cetera.
so
it
wasn't
limited
to
imla.
do
you
think
that
was
just
carelessness
on
the
court's
part?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
respect
to
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
opinion
in
the
last
time
around
not
only
contained
the
statement
that
i
read
before,
that
is,
"any
relevant
statute",
but
in
the
very
beginning
it
says,
"we
hold
the
tribe's
claim
for
compensation
from
the
federal
government
fails.
"
and
there
is
a
well-known
distinction
between
a
claim
and
an
issue
and
attributing
to
the
court
that
kind
of
carelessness
for
saying
that
the
claim
is
barred
as
distinguished
from
an
issue,
the
issue
being
imla
--
i
think
the
court
was
conscious
of
that
distinction
when
it
used
the
words
that
the
"claim"
fails,
not
just
the
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
did
you,
mr.
phillips.
last
time
around
you
acknowledged
that
the
peabody
lease
was
governed
only
by
imla.
that
--
those
words
were
from
your
brief
last
time
around.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
are
really
saying
that
you
were
wrong
in
make
that
concession.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
--
imla--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it
is
the
statute
that
seems
most
closely
on
point,
because
it's
the
only
one
that
talks
about
mineral
leases
exclusively.
