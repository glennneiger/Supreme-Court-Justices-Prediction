we
will
hear

today
in

v.

nation.

chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
said
"pertinent
or
relevant",
but
surely
that's
limited
to
the
statutory
provisions
that
we
examined
in
the
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
--
this
may
be
a
purely
academic
distinction,
but
you
talked
in
terms
of
liability.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
trust
principles
do
not
set
a
standard
to
which
the
secretary
is
bound,
or
simply
that
they
don't
constitute
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
where
is
the
specific
reference
to
mineral
leases,
mineral
resources,
i
guess?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
it
says
"resources".
i
don't
remember
it
saying
"mineral
resources".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
big
difference,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
knew
all
of
that.
that's
not
--
that's
not
something
you
discovered
on
remand.
you
knew
all
that
before.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
affidavit
was
before
or
after
our
decision
the
first
time
around?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
you
are
right
about
the
duty-creating
aspect,
what
--
talk
a
little
about
the
money-mandating
aspect,
the
second
stage
of
the
analysis
under
navajo
1.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
we
find
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
opening
up
the
treasury
of
the
united
states,
we
usually
insist
on
something
a
little
more
specific
than
general
trust
principles.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
not
how
the
secretary
reads
635.
isn't
he
entitled
to
chevron
deference?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
nine
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that's
responsive
to
justice
stevens's
question.
i
mean,
you
are
arguing
the
merits,
but
those
haven't
been
decided.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief

john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-1410,
united
state
versus
navajo
nation,
which
i
will
announce.
for
over
15
years,
the
navajo
nation
indian
tribe
has
been
pursuing
litigation
against
the
federal
government
seeking
$600
million
in
compensation
for
what
it
says
was
a
breach
of
trust
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
the
secretary
allegedly
violated
duties
to
the
tribe
by
failing
promptly
to
approve
an
increased
royalty
rate
for
a
coal
lease
that
had
been
executed
in
1964
by
the
tribe
and
a
mining
company.
under
the
terms
of
that
lease,
the
royalty
rate
was
subject
to
reasonable
adjustment
by
the
secretary
of
interior
after
20
years.
the
tribe
accordingly
sought
to
secure
an
increase
in
the
royalty
rate
but
the
mining
company
objected.
according
to
the
tribe,
the
secretary
delayed
acting
on
the
matter
until
economic
pressures
forced
the
tribe
to
reach
a
far
less
favorable
negotiated
settlement.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
initially
held
in
favor
of
the
tribe
but
six
years
ago,
we
reversed
that
decision.
to
recover
damages
from
the
federal
government
under
the
relevant
statute,
a
tribe
must
“identify”
a
substantive
source
of
law
that
establishes
specific
fiduciary
or
other
duties
and
allege
that
the
government
has
failed
faithfully
to
perform
those
duties.
we
held
that
the
statutes
and
regulations
cited
by
the
tribe
did
not
establish
any
enforceable
fiduciary
duties
with
respect
to
coal
leases
negotiated
by
tribes
with
third
parties.
we
remanded
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
the
federal
circuit
again
held
that
the
tribe
had
a
viable
claim,
this
time
based
on
a
series
of
other
statutes
and
on
common
law
trust
duties
arising
from
the
government's
comprehensive
control
over
indian
coal.
once
again,
we
reversed.
the
three
statutes
that
the
federal
circuit
relied
upon
do
not
provide
any
more
sound
of
a
basis
for
the
tribe's
breach
of
trust
lawsuit
than
those
we
considered
and
rejected
the
first
time
we
considered
this
case,
nor
can
the
government's
control
over
indian
coal
standing
alone
create
fiduciary
duties
enforceable
in
suits
for
money
damages.
the
federal
government
has
only
waived
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
certain
categories
of
claims
and
the
tribe
cannot
succeed
in
this
lawsuit
unless
it
identifies
a
“specific
rights-creating
or
duty-imposing
statutory
or
regulatory
prescription.”
the
tribe
has
failed
to
make
the
showing.
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
reversed
and
this
case
should
now
be
regarded
as
closed.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
has
joined.
