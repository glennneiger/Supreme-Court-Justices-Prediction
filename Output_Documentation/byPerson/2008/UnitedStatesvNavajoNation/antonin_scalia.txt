justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
in
imla
or
is
that
in
the
rehabilitation
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
side
says
that
certain
standard
provisions
in
the
imla
leases
did
not
exist
in
this
lease.
is
that
accurate?
justice
antonin
scalia
--with
the
forms?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
you
say
that
those
were
not
relevant
and,
therefore,
they
were
not
covered
by
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
rehabilitation
act,
is
the
requirements
for
approval
of
lease,
is
--
is
that
applicable
to
mineral
leases?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
about
the
fact
that
the
term
of
this
lease
would
--
would
not
be
permitted
under
the
rehabilitation
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
all
that
the
rehabilitation
act--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
expired--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
phillips,
the
government
says
that
by
the
time
this
lease
was
executed
the
rehabilitation
act
was
a
dead
letter,
that
it
was
meant
to
stimulate
economic
activity
on
the
navajo
reservation,
and
there
were
funds
appropriated
for
that
purpose,
and
that
had
all
been
played
out
by
the
time
this
lease
was
--
was
entered
into.
is
there
something
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
that
you
can
bring
in
federal
officials
to
--
to
testify
years
after
the
fact
as
to
on
what
basis
they
acted
earlier.
that's
very
strange
to
me.
i
don't
know
what
--
what
motive
secretary
udall
has
today
that
might
induce
him
to
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there
was
some
statement
at
the
time,
i
could
understand
it.
but
bringing
him
in
how
many
years
after,
40
years
after?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
secretary
udall
think
about
this?
