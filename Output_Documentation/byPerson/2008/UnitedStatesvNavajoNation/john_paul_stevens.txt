gen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
one
question?
i
probably
should
have
asked
earlier.
but
there
is
no
dispute
as
the
case
comes
to
us.
i
know
the
government
has
taken
the
position
that
there
was
no
breach
of
trust.
but
do
we
--
we
do
have
to
decide
it
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
breach
of
trust
that
caused
all
this
damage?
