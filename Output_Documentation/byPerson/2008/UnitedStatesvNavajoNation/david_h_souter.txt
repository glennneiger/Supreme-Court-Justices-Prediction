justice
david
h.

okay.
explain
to
me
the
--
the
relative
scope
of
imla
and
the
rehab
act.
the
--
the
argument
that
you
made,
that
you
just
made,
makes
perfect
sense
if
the
rehab
act
applies
to
some
kinds
of
--
of
leases
or
contracts
that
the
--
that
imla
does
not.
and
yet
i
--
i
thought
you
were
saying
a
little
bit
earlier
that
the
rehab
act
applies
to
all
mineral
leasing,
because
that
would
be
the
development
of
a
natural
resource.
and
if
that
is
so,
then
there
seems
to
be
a
pretty
clear
conflict,
even
on
your
own
argument,
between
the
term
provisions
in
the
rehab
act
and
the
term
provisions
of
imla
with
respect
to
--
to
mineral
leases.
how
do
--
how
do
we
get
out
of
that
problem
for
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
a
special
protection
and
special
duty
that
applies
to
every
one
of
the
mineral
leases,
including
this
one,
that
the
navajo
may
be
involved
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
--
what
--
maybe
--
maybe
i
missed
the
point,
but
would
you
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
question:
how
is
it
that
there
is
not
a
conflict
here
between
this
lease
and
the
rehab
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that,
in
effect
--
but
that,
in
effect,
is
saying
this
--
this
provision
will
never
apply
to
a
mineral
lease
with
the
navajo
or
the
hopi.
i
mean,
you
are
reading
it
right
out
of
the
act
with
respect
to
these
two
tribes.
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect
--
my
point
is
with
respect
to
every
mineral
lease
of
the
hopi
and
the
navajo--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
are
saying
the
term
provision
never
applies.
isn't
that
correct--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
it
only
applies
to
those
two
tribes.
and
there
is
something
very,
very
strange,
it
seems
to
me,
in
saying
that
the
--
that
the
kind
of
--
the
saving
sentence
at
the
end
of
section
5
reads
its
very
term
limit
provisions
out
of
every
--
out
of
every
possible
application
for
mineral
lease
by
these
two
tribes.
and
that's
what
you
are
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
that,
in
effect,
means
that
--
and
i
don't
want
to
overdo
your
barber
shop
analysis
or
example,
but
that,
in
effect,
says--
justice
david
h.
souter
--on
--
on
trivial
contracts,
trivial
lease
contracts,
there
are
term
limits,
but
on
the
ones
that
really
count,
where
the
real
money
is,
it
doesn't
apply
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
pretty
strange.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
that,
and
i
--
i
--
i
think
your
argument
is
well
taken.
but
assuming
that,
don't
we
also
have
to
assume
that
the
stress
in
imla
on
placing
primary
responsibility
on
the
tribes,
not
on
the
secretary,
should
in
fact
also
be
imported
to
the
application
of
the
rehab
act
as
you
say
it
should
be
applied?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
not
an
authority?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
you
made
a
good
argument
a
few
moments
ago
for
the
fact
that
it
would
have
been
at
least
at
one
time
inappropriate
to
thrust
that
responsibility
on
the
navajo,
but
there
was
no
navajo
exception
in
imla.
that
responsibility
was
thrust
on
the
navajo--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
this
court
recognized
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
--
your
argument
is
that
simply
because
there
isn't
that
kind
of
an
exclusion
in
(a),
there
must
have
been
an
intent
to
permit
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
why
did
business
purpose--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
just
supplement
justice
kennedy's
question?
why
can't
the
development
of
the
mineral
leases
be
regarded
as
an
adjunct
to
a
business
enterprise?
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
mean,
business
purposes
are
included.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
the
regs
specifically
address
the
scope
of
business
purposes?
