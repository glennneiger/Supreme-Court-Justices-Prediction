mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
six
years
ago
this
court
rejected
the
navajo
nation's
claim
for
damages
in
connection
with
the
same
action
that
is
before
the
court
here,
the
secretary's
approval
of
amendments
to
the
tribe's
mineral
lease
in
the
mid-1980s.
the
court
held
there
that
in
order
for
the
united
states
to
be
held
liable
under
the
tucker
act
or
the
indian
tucker
act,
the
claimant
must
identify
at
the
threshold
a
specific
rights-creating
or
duty-imposing
statutory
or
regulatory
prescription
that
the
government
has
allegedly
violated.
the
court
found
no
warrant
in
any
relevant
statute
or
regulation
to
impose
liability
on
the
united
states.
in
particular,
the
court
concluded
that
the
approval
of
the
royalty
rates
in
the
tribe's
lease
was
governed
by
the
indian
mineral
leasing
act
of
1938,
or
imla.
looking
at
imla's
framework,
the
court
held
that
there
was
no,
quote,
"textual
basis",
close
quote,
in
any
pertinent
statutory
or
regulatory
provision
that
required
the
secretary
to
insist
that
the
tribe
negotiate
for
a
higher
rate.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
i
think
the
way
to
look
at
it
is
what
the
court
said,
that
it
found
no
warrant
in
any
relevant
statute
or
regulation,
and
it
discussed
not
just
imla
but
several
other
statutes
which
--
which
did
have
to
do
with
the
economic
--
excuse
me
--
the
economic
terms
of
leases,
but--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--didn't
govern.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
two
things
about
that.
the
government's
question
presented
was
that
the
court
could
not
find
the
united
states
liable
or
--
was
whether
the
court
could
find
the
united
states
liable
without
finding
a
violation
of
imla.
and
therefore,
the
premise
of
the
question
was,
without
finding
a
violation
of
imla,
the
united
states
could
not
be
liable,
and
the
court
found
no
violation
of
imla.
but
beyond
that,
the
tribe's
principal
submission
in
this
court
was
that
the
united
states
had
control
through
a
network
of
statutes,
including
the
ones
they
rely
on
here.
but
the
court
also
itself
on
page
30
of
its
brief
in
that
case
identified
the
relevant
statutes
as
being
imla
and
the
other
two
that
this
court
discussed
and
the
general
introduction
to
the
rehabilitation
act.
so
i
think
the
structure
of
the
court's
opinion,
looking
at
the
way
the
tribe
serves
it
up,
the
court
said
there
has
to
be
a
specific
violation
of
a
--
of
a
statutory
regulatory
prescription.
the
court
found
that
the
relevant
one
was
imla,
and
it
found
no
violation.
and
therefore
--
and
the
court
also
said
the
tribe's
claim,
not
simply
arguments
made
in
favor
of
the
claim,
must
fail.
but
if
the
court
concludes
that
its
prior
decision
did
not
absolutely
foreclose
the
litigation,
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
framework
that
this
court
announced
in
--
or
reaffirmed
in
navajo
1
itself
does
foreclose
the
claim
here.
as
i
said,
the
court
concluded
that
imla
is
the
statute
that
governs
the
approval
of
royalty
terms
in
coal
leases.
on
remand,
the
federal
circuit
relied
on
two
other
statutes
addressing
other
subjects,
the
surface
mining
reclamation
and
control
act,
which
has
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
environmental
issues,
matters
that
may
arise
in
connection
with
a
coal
lease,
and
the
hopi-navajo
rehabilitation
act
of
1950,
which
set
in
motion
a
general
governmental
program
to
rehabilitate
and
improve
the
economic
life
of
the
navajo
and
hopi
indians.
but
neither
of
those
statutes
had
anything
to
do
with
the
approval
of
the
economic
terms
of
coal
leases.
that
was
governed
by
imla.
so
the
fact
that
the
federal
circuit
on
remand
held
the
united
states
liable
on
the
basis
of
two
statutes
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
coal
leasing,
minus
the
statute
that
did
have
something
to
do
with
coal
leasing,
in
our
view
shows
how
far
the
federal
circuit
has
strayed
from
this
court's
teachings.
but
beyond
that,
we
think
it's
a
fortiori
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
its
alternative
holding,
which
was
that
the
united
states
could
be
held
liable
on
the
basis
of
general
common
law
principles.
the
tucker
act
and
the
indian
tucker
act
provide
that
the
united
states
may
be
liable
only
for
a
violation
of
an
act
of
congress
or
a
regulation.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
this
court
stated
in
navajo
--
in
the
navajo
case
that
there
has
to
be
a
violation
of
a
specific
statutory
or
regulatory
provision.
even
as
a
general
matter,
under
this
court's
jurisprudence,
there
is
only
a
very
limited
role
for
federal
common
law,
but
that
is
especially
so
when
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
liability
for
damages
under
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
the
usual
sovereign
immunity
principles
have
to
cast
considerable
doubt
on
that.
only
an
act
of
congress
or
a
regulation
adopted
pursuant
to
congressionally
conferred
authority
can
provide
for
the
payment
of
money
out
of
the
federal
treasury
under
our
constitution.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
there
could
be
--
there
could
be
claims
brought,
but
those
would
not
be
for
money
damages.
they're--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
in
the
federal
circuit,
to
my
knowledge,
because
--
because
the
administrative
procedure
act--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
no
--
in
the
--
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
--
i'm
not
--
just
like
any
party
could
claim
--
could
challenge
what
was
done
by
the
department
taking
particular
administrative
action.
and
i
think
there
--
i
think
that
was--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
not
--
not
in
the
way
you
put
it.
but
there
are
cases
that
certainly
talk
about
the
secretary
has
trust
responsibilities.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
in
which
that
concept
can
be
used.
it
can
be
used
in
a
political
sense
in
that
the
united
states
government,
through
treaties
or
a
general
sense
of
moral
responsibility,
should
look
out
for
the
indians,
and
in
the
day-to-day
administration
of
indian
affairs
to
contemplate
a
trust
responsibility
is
simply
to
mean
that
the
united
states
has
a
special
relationship
and
--
and
should
deal
in
that
manner.
and
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
if
there
is
--
if
there
is
an
action
the
united
states
takes
under
a
statute
that
governs
indian
affairs,
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
subject
to
judicial
review
under
the
general
principles,
is
it
arbitrary
and
capricious
under
normal
principles,
does
substantial
evidence
sustain
the
determination?
but,
particularly
in
a
suit
for
money
damages
under
the
--
under
the
tucker
act
and
where
congress
has
said
there
has
to
be
a
violation
of
a
money-mandating
statute
or
--
or
regulation,
general
common
law
principles
do
not
suffice.
as
i
said,
for
money
damages,
only
congress
or
an
executive
agency
under
--
acting
pursuant
to
congressional
authority
under
the
constitution
can
provide
for
the
payment
of
--
of
money
out
of
the
federal
treasury.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it's
really
both.
the
general
trust
principles,
at
least
--
at
least
again
under
tucker
act
jurisprudence,
general
trust
principles
are
not
what
establish
the
secretary's
duties.
it's
the
acts
of
congress
that
impose
duties
on
the
secretary
in
this
area
as
in
any
others,
or
regulations
the
secretary
has
prescribed
under
it.
now,
under
this
court's
jurisprudence,
the
court
has
said
that
the
notion
of
trust
is
relevant
at
the
second
stage
of
the
analysis.
the
first
stage
is
the
threshold
requirement
that
there
be
a
specific
statute
or
regulation
that
imposes
duties
or
rights.
if
the
court
finds
that,
then
at
the
second
stage,
as
this
court
has
held
in
mitchell
2
and
indicated
in
navajo
as
well,
that
may
be
relevant
to
determine
whether
those
specific
duty-imposing
statutes
in
turn
also
impose
monetary
liability
on
the
united
states
for
violation.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
what
the
court
said
in
--
in
navajo
specifically
with
respect
to
imla,
the
secretary,
yes,
does
have
to
approve
it,
but
the
court
specifically
rejected
the
proposition
that
there
was
any
basis
for
liability
stemming
from
the
secretary's
approval
of
the
lease.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
would
be
--
section
5
of
the
rehabilitation
act
for
approval
of
leases
is
essentially
the
same
as
imla.
it
provides
for
the
secretary
to
approve
the
lease.
but,
as
this
court
held
in
imla
--
or
in
navajo
1,
the
theory
of
imla
is
not
to
have
the
secretary
be
responsible
or
to
take
the
lead
in
leasing
tribal
lands
for
coal
purposes.
it's
the
tribe,
subject
to
the
approval,
and
the
court
concluded
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
that
arrangement
for
the
secretary
to
second-guess
the
determinations
that
the
secretary
had
made.
and
the
court
--
the
argument
was
made
there
and
expressly
rejected
that
the
secretary
was
required
to
insist
that
the
tribe
negotiate
a
higher
amount
when
it
renegotiated
the
lease.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
what
--
what
the
secretary
has
adopted
--
has
done
is
by
regulation,
is
to
say
that
--
that
there
is
a
minimum
that
the
tribe
cannot
go
below.
at
the
time
--
at
the
time
of
the
renegotiation
of
this
lease
in
1987,
from
1984
to
1987,
there
was
a
minimum
of
10
percent
or
10
cents
per
ton.
the
tribe
was
getting
37.5
cents
per
ton.
this
lease
was
renegotiated
in
connection
with
a
clause
in
the
lease
that
allowed
adjustments
for
reasonable
rates,
which
is
not
the
same
thing
as
maximizing
the
tribe's
--
the
tribe's
revenues,
so
the
secretary
had
a
regulation
at
the
time
of
10
cents
per
ton.
the
secretary
now
has
a
regulation
that
says
the
minimum
royalty
rate
will
be
12.5
percent,
which,
as
court
pointed
out
in
navajo
1,
is
the
standard
royalty
rate
for
federal
and
tribal
leases
throughout
the
united
states.
now,
what
is
significant,
in
further
response
to
your
question,
is
that
regulation
states
that
that
minimum
rate
is
12.5
percent
unless
the
secretary
determines
that
a
lower
rate
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
indians.
so
the
way
this
works
then,
the
way
the
secretary
has
implemented
it,
it's
basically
up
to
the
tribe
to
negotiate
something
at
or
above
the
minimum.
if
it's
below
the
minimum
that
the
secretary's
prescribed,
the
secretary
has
to
make
a
judgment
that
that
going
lower,
maybe
because
of
geological
conditions
or
whatever,
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
indians.
and
that
is
--
that
is
borne
out--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
in
imla.
that's
an
imla
regulation.
the
general
regulations
that
implement
the
rehabilitation
act
have
a
similar
provision.
they
don't
talk
about
royalties,
which
i
think
is
telling
because
royalties
have
to
do
with
coal
leases.
they
talk
about
--
they
require
that
there
be
a
fair
rental
for
--
for
property,
not
a
maximum
rental
but
a
fair
rental.
and
then
it
has
the
same
sort
of
thing,
that
if
it's
going
to
be
below
the
fair
market
value
it
has
to
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
indians.
and
i
think
it's
instructive
that
i
know
there's
been
an
argument
that
this
lease
is
governed
by
the
--
by
the
rehabilitation
act
rather
than
imla,
notwithstanding
what
this
court
held
in
navajo
1
six
years
ago,
but
in
1999
when
secretary
babbitt,
who
joined
the
brief
arguing
that
this
is
covered
by
the
rehabilitation
act,
approved
the
amendments
to
the
lease
in
1999,
he
approved
it
under
the
imla
regulations
and
he
specifically
said
that
because
the
minimum
royalty
rate
is
12.5
percent
--
he
is
quoting
the
applicable
regulation
--
"i
do
not
have
to
decide
whether
the
royalty
rate
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
indians.
"
he
went
on
to
say:
"but
i
think
it
is".
so
secretary
babbitt's
approval
of
those
amendments
really
explains
the
way
the
secretary
has
implemented
the
statutory
scheme,
and
we
think
that's
certainly
well
within
the
secretary's
discretion
under
a
statute
that
did
not
impose
any
limitations.
with
respect
to
the
rehabilitation
act,
the
general
leasing
provision
of
that
act,
as
we've
explained
in
our
brief,
does
not
apply
to
mineral
leases.
that
continued
to
be
governed
by
imla
after
1950.
but
even
if
it
did,
there
is
nothing
in
section
5
that
imposes
any
more
specific
duties
with
respect
to
royalty
terms
or
any
other
terms
than
imla
itself.
section
5
has
to
do
with
surface
--
leases
for
surface
users,
business
purposes
basically.
and
that
was
put
in
there
because
at
the
time
there
was
no
provision
for
long-term
leases
if
someone
wanted
to
bring
a
surface
commercial
venture
onto
a
reservation.
but
the
last
--
the
last
sentence
of
section
5
of
the
--
of
the
act
on
page
171a
of
the
petition
appendix
says
that:
"nothing
contained
in
section
5
shall
affect
the
authority
--
shall
be
construed
to
repeal
or
affect
the
authority
under
any
other
act
of
congress.
"
so
section
--
and
the
other
act
of
congress
here
is
imla.
i
think
it's
also
instructive
to
point
out
not
only
did
this
court
hold
the
last
time
around
that
the
lease
was
governed
by
imla,
that
--
that
was
the
tribe's
position
in
this
case.
its
proposed
findings
of
fact
indeed
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
pages
524
and
525
of
the
joint
appendix,
said
that
the
lease
was
governed
by
imla.
but
the
textual
dispositive
point
is
this
lease
couldn't
have
been
entered
into
under
the
rehabilitation
act.
the
lease
in
this
case
provided
that
the
lease
would
be
for
a
term
of
10
years
and
then
subject
to
a
further
extension
for
as
long
as
minerals
are
produced
in
paying
quantities.
that
precise
language
is
repeated
in
the
lease,
which
shows
that
it
was
under
imla.
under
section
5
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
the
lease
could
only
be
for
an
initial
term
of
25
years
and
then
a
further
term
of
25
more
years.
it
wouldn't
have
allowed
for
this
sort
of
lease
here
and
indeed,
because
the
initial
lease
term
here
was
10
years
and
then
could
have
only
been
25
more
years
under
--
under
the
rehab
act,
this
lease
would
have
had
to
expire
in
1999,
and
yet
it
was
amended
at
that
time
and
continues
in
effect
and
mining
continues
under
it.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
well,
they
said
--
i
think
--
the
only
thing
i
think
they
say
along
those
lines
is
that
--
has
to
do
with
the
forms
of
the
lease,
if
i'm--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
form
on
which
the
lease
is
used.
i
think
what
they
said
is
there
were
several
provisions
that
appear
in
regulations
under
general
leasing
statutes
that
are
in
these,
are
in
these
leases.
they
aren't
in
these
leases
--
one
has
to
do
with
the
property
can't
be
used
for
unlawful
purposes,
and
i'm
forgetting
what
the
second
one
was.
but
it
wouldn't
be
unusual
that
the
--
that
the
secretary
might
borrow
or
a
tribe
might
borrow
provisions
from
other
leases
and
put
them
in
this
lease.
this
is
--
again,
imla
provides
for
negotiation.
so
the
parties
are
free
to
put
in
particular
provisions
of
lease.
so
that
the
fact
that
there
might
be
things
that
would
parallel
what
were
in
the
other
leases
we
don't
think
is
really
dispositive.
also,
the
other
significant
thing
is
that
the
lease
itself
incorporates
or
refers
to
by
reference
the
imla
regulations.
so
even
if
somehow
this
lease
were
thought
to
be
governed
by
section
5,
even
though
that
wasn't
what
it
was
issued
under,
the
imla
regulations
would
control,
and
this
court
already
held
in
navajo
1
that
those
imla
regulations,
which
are
in
the
lease,
do
not
impose
any
--
did
not
impose
any
duty
on
the
secretary
with
respect
to
the
approval,
approval
of
the
lease.
i
should
also
point
out
that
when
the
--
we
cite
this
in
our
--
in
our
brief,
that
at
the
time
the
lease
amendments
were
approved
in
1987
the
solicitor's
office
did
--
did
a
legal
review
of
the
propriety
of
the
lease
amendments
and
that
legal
review
expressly
says
that
the
lease
was
entered
into
under
--
under
imla.
so
i
think
the
circumstances
are
really
overwhelming
that
--
that
it
was
entered
into
under
imla
and
that
the
rehabilitation
act
lease
provision
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
this
lease.
and
the
more
general
emanations
from
the
rehabilitation
act
that
the
tribe
seeks
to
rely
on
here
are
too
general,
in
short.
the
rehabilitation
act
was
enacted
in
1950
in
recognition
that
the
plight
of
the
navajo
and
hopi
was
very
serious,
and
congress
undertook
to
study
resources
and
put
in
infrastructure
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
part
of
it
was
to
have
programs
--
excuse
me
--
studies
to
determine
what
the
tribe's
coal
resources
were,
and
that
was
done,
and
this
lease
grew
out
of
that.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
was
in
any
way
governed
by
the
rehabilitation
act.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
i
would
--
i
would
suggest
that
this
case
be
reversed.
i
mean,
this
--
this
concerns
a
--
outright
and
with
directions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
this
--
this
controversy
arose
in
the
mid-1980's.
the
litigation
has
been
going
on
since
1993,
and
it's
been
--
this
is
now
the
second
time
that
it's
been
--
that
it's
been
to
this
court.
and
we
think
in
doing
so
that
the
--
that
the
court
should
reiterate
the
analytical
framework
that
it
put
forward
in
--
in
its
decision
the
last
time
around
so
that
there
will
be
no
mistaking
the
way
these
cases
are
to
be
handled
in
the
federal
circuit
in
the
future
by
requiring
at
the
threshold,
a
--
as
i
said,
a
specific
statutory
or
regulatory
provision
that
imposes
duties
and
not
in
particular
looking
at
general
notions
of
common
law
that
--
that
might
arise
out
of
--
out
of
some
sort
of
--
some
sort
of
factual
control.
the
last
thing
i
wanted
to
say
is
that
the
federal
circuit
also
relied
on
the
surface
mining
reclamation
and
control
act.
and
that
--
and
that,
as
i
said,
has
to
do
with
environmental
issues
in
connection
with
--
with
indian
leases.
the
federal
circuit
relied
on
a
provision
that
says
that
the
--
that
the
secretary
should
include
in
any
indian
leases
additional
provisions
that
were
proposed
by
the
tribe.
but
that's
additional
provisions
in
addition
to
other
environmental
provisions
stemming
from
the
statute
that
had
to
be
in
the
lease.
it
was
--
it
was
just
quite
a
stretch
for
the
--
for
the
court
to
conclude
that
that
somehow
controlled
economic
terms
of
the
leases.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
first,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect
to
the
text
of
section
5,
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
by
any
means
suggest
that
it
covers
mineral
leases.
the
pertinent
phrase
is
that
they
--
that
the
tribe
or
members
of
the
tribe
"may
lease"
--
"with
the
approval
of
the
secretary,
may
lease
for
various
religious,
recreational,
or
business
purposes,
including
the
development.
"
of
utilization
--
"or
utilization
of
natural
resources
in
connection
with
the
operations
under
those
leases.
"
it's
not
a
free-standing
mineral
lease
or
resource
lease
provision.
it
says
"including"
and
"in
connection
with
operations
under
such
leases.
"
referring
back
to
business
leases
or
the
other
--
the
other
things
there.
so
i
think,
on
its
face,
it
doesn't
suggest
it
covers
mineral
leases.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
but--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
"in
connection
with
operations
under
such
leases.
"
and
--
and
what's
above
are
a
recitation
of
things
that
don't
include
mineral
leases.
it's
educational,
recreational,
and
business
leases.
and
as
we
explained,
there
are
specific--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
says
"business"
purposes,
"and
as
such"--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
"for
public,
religious"
--
"public"
would
be
like
for
a
school,
if
a
state
was
going
to
put
a
school
on
or
something.
but
--
but
the
--
but
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
there
was
a
specific
reason
why
congress
enacted
this.
there
was
a
gap
in
the
authority
to
lease
for
these
types
of
purposes
at
the
time
this
was
enacted.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
--
the
example
would
be--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
example
would
be,
if
you
--
for
example,
if
you
were
going
to
use
water
--
this
is
a
navajo
reservation
--
if
you
needed
water
for
a
business
and
sink
a
well,
you
would
be
utilizing
or
developing
the
natural
resources
in
connection
with
a
surface
lease.
but
--
but
the
last
section
of
--
the
last
sentence
of
section
5
says,
"nothing
in
this
section
shall
be
construed
to
repeal
or
affect
the
authority
under
other
provisions.
"
and
it's
the
other
provision
that
is
imla.
the
regulations--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
--
i
suppose
they
could,
but
in
--
in
the
terminology,
mineral
leasing,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief
--
that
the
categories
of
leasing
that
are
--
have
always
been
handled
differently.
"mineral
leasing"
is
the
term
that
is
used
for
minerals.
business,
grazing,
farming,
we
explain
this
in
our
brief,
that
those
are
different.
the
regulations
that
were
utilized
to
implement
section
5
have
never
included
specific
provisions
for
mineral
leases.
they
have
always
been
under
other
--
other
provisions.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
--
they
--
not
beyond
basically
repeating
them,
but
the
--
but
they,
for
example,
talk
about
rental
value,
which
is
not
the
way
you
describe
mineral
leases,
which
are
--
which
are
royalties,
not
rental
value.
if
i
could
also
address
the
argument
about
sections
(b)
and
(c),
sections
(b)
and
(c)
of
this
act
provide
--
first
of
all,
were
enacted
after
section
(a),
so
i
don't
think
much
of
an
inference
could
be
drawn.
but
they
were
situations,
special
types
of
conveyances
that
the
tribe
was
going
to
make.
one
was
for
fee
land
that
it
was
--
that
it
was
transferring.
there
would
be
no
reason
to
think
the
united
states
should
be
liable
for
that,
for
what
the
tribe
did
with
its
own
fee
land,
and
congress
just
wanted
to
make
sure
of
that.
the
other
was
that
the
tribe
could
convey
trust
land
to
municipalities
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
what
the
statute
says,
thereafter
the
united
states
won't
be
liable.
the
united
states
was
just
making
sure
it
was
washing
its
hands
of
it.
under
section
(a),
we
aren't
saying
that
there
could
be
no
lease
under
which
it
could
conceivably
be
for
a
business
purpose
in
which
the
united
states
could
be
liable.
if
there
was
a
regulation
establishing
a
minimum
floor
and
the
lease
terms
went
below
that,
then
that
might
be
a
circumstance
in
which
liability
could
be
imposed.
but
otherwise,
justice
breyer
is
completely
correct:
this
statute
on
its
face
imposes
no
more
of
a
duty
on
the
secretary
with
respect
to
the
approval
of
whatever
leases
are
covered
than
imla
imposed
on
the
secretary
with
respect
to
--
with
respect
to
mineral
leases.
and
--
and
another
important
point
is,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
cotton
petroleum
and
montana
v.
blackfeet
tribe,
the
imla
was
enacted
to
bring
uniformity
to
mineral
leasing.
and
the
notion
that
congress
would
have
implicitly
wanted
to
carve
the
navajo
and
hopi
out
of
that
general
authorization
and
that
preexisting
set
of
regulations
and
cover
it
by
--
by
a
provision
like
this,
we
think
is
just
not
consistent
with
the
way
congress
has
dealt
with
mineral
leases
over
the
--
over
the
years.
i
also
just
wanted
to
come
back
to
this
idea
of
--
of
imposing
liability
on
the
basis
of
the
common
law,
because
the
example
of
what
the
federal
circuit
did
in
this
case,
with
all
respect
to
that
court,
we
think
strayed
so
far
from
what
this
court
laid
down
in
navajo
that
it's
important
for
this
court,
however
it
thinks
it
disposed
of
the
case
before,
to
make
clear
that
liability
cannot
be
imposed
unless,
as
this
court
said
in
navajo,
there
is
--
there
is
a
specific
rights-creating
or
duty-imposing
language
in
the
statute
itself.
the
theory
that
has
been
adopted
in
some
lower
court
--
federal
circuit
decisions,
is
you
can
look
at
a
hodgepodge
of
statutes,
one
dealing
with
environmental
concerns,
one
dealing
with
rights-of-way,
one
dealing
with
this,
add
them
all
up
and
say
the
united
states
has
control
and,
therefore,
out
of
that
sort
of
bucket
of
statutes,
you
can
impose
trust
responsibilities.
that's
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
tucker
act,
which
requires
that
the
liability
be
based
on
the
statutes
themselves,
and
you
have
to
look
at
each
statute
and
each
regulation
that
governs
the
united
states
in
indian
affairs
in
the
same
way,
under
the
tucker
act,
you
would
look
at--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--what
governs
the
united
states
elsewhere
to
decide
whether
there
is
liability.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
no.
i
think
that's
not
at
all
correct.
with
respect
to
the
approval
of
the
lease
terms
in
1987
--
under
a
provision
that
provided
for
12.5
percent.
the
tribe
entered
into
two
other
leases
at
the
very
same
time
that
are
not
the
subject
of
this
case,
for
12.5
percent.
that's
the
standard
royalty
rate.
and
the
tribe
got
other
benefits
from
this
as
a
package.
with
respect
to
the
arguments
about
what
the
secretary
did
on
--
on
appeal,
it's
even
clearer
that
all
this
information
about
the
secretary
meeting
with
peabody's
lobbyist
was
before
the
court
before,
and
the
court
found
no
violation
of
any
statute
or
regulation.
but
it's
even
clearer
on
remand,
as
we
point
out
on
page
22
of
our
reply
brief,
that
the
tribe
was
fully
aware
that
the
secretary
was
not
going
to
--
had
--
had
said
the
appeal
was
not
going
to
be
acted
on
and
had
sent
the
parties
back
to
negotiations.
in
fact,
when
chairman
zah
of
the
tribe
opened
the
negotiations
on
august
30
of
1985,
he
said,
"it
appears
that
the
secretary
wants
us
to
take
another
shot
at
negotiating
the
lease.
"
he
knew
what
had
happened.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
what
the
--
what
the
court
of
federal
claims
said
along
those
lines
was
a
legal
conclusion,
not
a
factual
conclusion.
and
the
--
the
facts
as
describe
were
what
they
were
before
and
the
court
found
no
violation.
and
--
and
as
we
say,
it's
clear
factually
on
remand
that
the
tribe
knew.
but
again,
that
was
just
--
it's
not
a
factual
determination
that
has
to
be
taken
as
true.
for
one
thing,
it
was
summary
judgment,
not
factual
findings.
but
it
does
--
it
was
just
a
legal
conclusion.
and
at
that,
it
was
the
sort
of
legal
conclusion
drawn
from
general
notions
of
fiduciary
responsibility,
nothing
that
has
been
channeled
or
embodied
or
codified
in
a
statute
or
regulation.
and
we
think
to
unleash
the
common
law
to
regulate
the
day-to-day
operations
of
a
vast
agency
like
the
interior
department,
which
has
to
operate
by
statutes
and
regulations,
would
be
--
under
vermont
yankee
and
this
court's
other
jurisprudence,
would
be
--
would
be
unwarranted
for
the
courts
to
do
and
especially
in
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
under
the
--
under
the
tucker
act,
to
impose
damages
liability
for
the
violation
of
a
procedural
regulation.
and,
of
course,
the
court
pointed
out
the
last
time
that
there
was
no
prohibition
against
ex
parte
contacts
for
this
sort
of
informal
adjudication,
as
there
isn't
across
--
across
the
board
for
government
--
government
activities.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
