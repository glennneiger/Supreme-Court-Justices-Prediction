mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
would
like
to
start
with
justice
alito's
question
because
he
said:
doesn't
section
5
of
the
rehabilitation
act
specifically
require
the
secretary
to
approve
this
lease?
and
mr.
kneedler
conceded
that
it
does.
and
so
then
the
question
is:
doesn't
that
create
some
kind
of
a
duty?
and
it
seems
to
me
clearly
it
does,
just
as
the
court
i
think
implicitly
said
in
navajo
1,
the
difference
between
navajo
1
and
navajo
2
being
that
this
court
then
went
on
to
examine
imla,
the
indian
mineral
leasing
act,
and
concluded
that
imla
very
specifically
for
the
entirety
of
native
americans
and
for
the
entirety
of
indian
mineral
leasing
had
a
preference
to
ensure
that
the
indian
tribes
themselves
would
--
would
attain
a
certain
self
sufficiency;
that
it
essentially
abdicated
the
responsibility
of
having
to
deal
with
individual
negotiations
and
allowed
it
for
the
tribes
to
take
over.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
i
would
--
i
would
never
assume
that,
justice
ginsburg.
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
the
operative
term
here
is
"relevant".
and
that
is
that
the
court
for
purposes
of
analyzing
the
question
presented
and
disposing
of
it
evaluated
not
only
imla,
but
the
other
two
provisions
that
the
--
that
the
--
that
the
court
felt
needed
to
be
disposed
of
at
that
point.
the
court
didn't
address
the
alternative
arguments
under
either
smcra
or
the
rehabilitation
act.
to
be
sure,
they
were
argued.
but
i
--
i
have
seen
many
instances
in
which
alternative
arguments
were
made,
and
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--not
relevant
to
the
question
presented,
which
is
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
--
the
indian
mineral
leasing
act.
and,
indeed,
if
you
look
at
the
other
two
provisions,
the
opinion
of
the
court
analyzes
them
through
the
--
through
the
prism
of
the
indian
mineral
leasing
act
and
just
says
those
don't
add
to
the
indian
mineral
leasing
act.
our
argument
here
is
that
section
5
of
the
rehabilitation
act
provides
a
wholly
independent
basis
on
which
there
is
a
duty
imposed,
but
that
duty
is
then
implemented
through
the
regulations
that
are
identified
in
the
--
in
the
secretary's--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--is
that
applicable
to
mineral
leases?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely,
it's
applicable
to
mineral
leases.
the
--
the
language
of
the
statute
is
"business
leases,
including
those
for
the
development
of
mineral
resources.
"
so
clearly
it
applies
to
mineral
leases,
but
it
does
not
include
the
indian
mineral
leasing
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mineral
resources.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
"the
development
of
the
resources
of
the
navajo
and
hopi
indian.
"
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry.
"the
development
or
utilization
of
natural
resources.
"
but
the
basic
point
there
is
that,
at
least
as
i
read
section
5,
what
it's
saying
is
that
it
grants
broad
leasing
authority.
the
solicitor
general
is
absolutely
right
about
that.
but
that
authority
extends
to
certain
kinds
of
mineral
leasing.
and
that's
--
and
that's
an
authority,
and
it's
important
to
recognize
this
because,
while
it
is
true
for
the
run-of-the-mill
native
americans
who
are
--
who
are
engaged
in
mineral
leasing
it
may
make
sense
to
say:
look,
we
--
we
are
going
to
take
a
hands-off
approach
for
the
most
part.
we
are
going
to
set
a
minimum
ceiling
or
a
minimum
floor
and
above
that
you
negotiate
as
hard
as
you
want.
but
the
navajo
were
in
a
fundamentally
different
position
in
1950
when
this
legislation
was
enacted.
the
--
the
median
education
on
that
--
on
that
reservation
was
less
than
one
year
of
education.
the
resources
were
$400
per
year
annual
income.
this
was
a
tribe
in
horrible
condition.
and
so
it
would
make
perfect
sense
for
congress
to
say:
look,
for
--
for
most
tribes
we
want
to
go
ahead
and
have
the
approval
be
based
with
the
--
with
the
secretary
taking
a
hands-off
approach
above
a
certain
minimum,
but
when
you
deal
with
the
navajo--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
solely
under
it.
i
--
i
think
that's
a
--
a
false
dichotomy.
i
don't
think
this
is
an
either/or
proposition.
i
think
there
are
parts
of
imla
that
can
reasonably
be
applied
here,
and
--
and
section
5
specifically
says
no
authority
from
other
statutes,
which
would
include
imla,
is
meant
to
be
superseded
by
the
passage
of
section
5.
so
i
think
there
is
a
rule.
and
i
think
that
this
lease
--
if
you
read
the
lease
on
its
face
--
justice
scalia
asked
the
question:
does
this
lease
conform
to
the
form
lease
that
you
get
under
imla?
the
answer
is
clearly
not.
this
is
a
mix
and
match
between
some
provisions,
it
seems
to
me,
that
clearly
provide
additional
protection
for
the
navajo
and
other
provisions
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
the
secretary
has
to
approve
it
under
both
of
those
provisions.
it
is
just
that
imla
in
this
particular
context
would
simply
impose
a
10-cent
minimum
per
ton.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it
would
be
permitted
under
the
rehabilitation
act
because
the
last
sentence
of
section
5
specifically
says
that
this
is
not
meant
to
limit
any
other
authority
provided
under
any
other
statute.
and
since
imla
provides
additional
time
and
durational
protections
for
the
tribes
under
these
circumstances,
that
provision
would
definitely
allow
you
to
use
imla's
time
limits
rather
than
the
rehabilitation
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
i
think
the
--
the
key
distinction
is
to
look
at
the
--
at
who
is
being
regulated,
and
under
the
rehabilitation
act
it's
the
navajo
and
the
hopi.
and
--
and
congress
said,
look,
we
are
going
to
take
special
care
to
protect
and
to
try
to
put
them
into
a
position
where
they
can
even
just
catch
up
to
other
native
americans.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
--
that's
a
special
protection
with
a
special
duty,
and
that
duty
is
enforced
through
the
162
regulations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
the
last
section
of
section
5
says
that,
notwithstanding
anything
else,
this
provision
doesn't
preclude
--
doesn't
--
doesn't
limit
authority
that
would
otherwise
exist.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
no.
i'm
sorry.
it's
because
this
provision
applies
to
a
lot
of
other
leases,
too.
are
you
asking
when
the
20
or
10
and
10.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
understand.
right.
i
have
the
answer
your
question,
which
is
this
provision
in
section
5
applies
not
just
to
mineral
leasing,
it
applies
to
all
business
site
leasing.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
--
but
--
but
the
important
distinction
--
and
i
hope
i
can
articulate
this
--
is
that
section
5
applies
beyond
mineral
leases.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
so
that
all
--
so
the
time
limitation
of
10
years
and
10
years,
if
you
bring
a
barber
shop,
you
want
to
build
a
barber
shop
on
those
lands,
you
want
to
lease
the
space
in
order
to
do
that,
you
would
be
subject
to
the
section
5
time
limitations,
unless
for
some
reason
there
is
another
authorization
somewhere.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
need
a
haircut.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
is
a--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--raytheon
has
an
entire
defense
plant
on
the
navajo
tribe
--
on
the
navajo
reservation
right
now,
that
would
obviously
be
subject
to
precisely
these
same
limitations.
so
it's
not
just
trivial.
it's
all
business
lease
citing
that
is
covered
by
that.
so
it
seems
to
me
not
at
all
unreasonable
to
think
that
congress,
in
its
--
in
its
very
protective
effort
here
under
section
5
would
say,
here
are
all
the
leases
that
you
are
allowed
to
enter
into.
you
have
broad
leasing
authority.
we
are
going
to
protect
you
against
overreaching
by
restricting
how
long
you
can
go,
but
if
there
are
other
provisions
of
law
that
allow
these
to
be
modified
in
a
particular
area,
we
will
allow
those
to
be
modified
in
that
way.
and
in
this
context,
what
that
last
sentence
would,
in
my
mind,
say
is
there
is
no
reason
to
try
and
--
to
say
imla
or
the
rehabilitation
act.
it
seems
to
me
much
more
sensible
to
say
that
congress
would
have
intended
multiple
protections
for
the
navajo.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but
you
see,
i
don't
think
that's
an
authority.
i
would
say
--
i
would
not
read--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
notion
that
the
navajo
tribe
would
be
in
a
position
to
better
--
to
better
--
to
--
i'm
sorry,
to
achieve
self-sufficiency.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
be
sure,
there
isn't--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
but
that's
exactly
why
i
think
the
navajo
rehabilitation
act
of
1950
does
modify
imla.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
obviously,
justice
ginsburg,
you
are
in
a
much
better
position
to
judge
what
was
intended
here.
on
the
other
hand,
my
experience
with
the
court
generally
is
that
when
you
analyze
a
case
you
analyze
it
in
terms
of
the
specific
question
that
is
presented,
and
if
you
are
proposing
to
go
beyond
the
question
presented
you
say
so
expressly,
not
simply
by
the
use
of
the
word
"claim"
or
"argument".
so
while
i
recognize
that
the
court
--
that
the
government
has
an
argument
to
be
made
that
this
has
pre-decided
that,
i
think,
frankly,
one,
the
court
didn't
decide
this
issue;
and
two,
the
court
should
decide
the
question
that
we've
presented
here
as
to
the
scope
of
section
5,
because
it's
obviously
of
extraordinary
importance
to
not
only
section
5
but
also
section
8
as
well.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yeah,
the
government's
wrong
about
that.
i
believe
--
the
program
itself
is
for
the
overall
rehabilitation
of
the
navajo
and
the
hopi.
there
are
a
series
of
projects
that
the
--
where
the
statute
says
"such
program
shall
include
the
following
projects.
"
it
doesn't
say
it's
limited
to
the
following
projects,
and
those
projects
have
been
set
out
with
a
set
of
times.
but
the
program
itself
is
not
--
is
not
limited
that
way
and
more
fundamentally,
it
is
completely
inconsistent
with
that
kind
of
time
limitation
on
the
statute
overall
that
congress
would
have
repealed
certain
sections
of
this
act,
sections
9
and
10,
after
the
10-year
period
that
expired
if
the
statute
didn't
have
any
continuing
implication.
it
also
would
have
meant
that
the
leasing
protections
in
section
5
had
expired
after
10
years,
which
seems
to
me
quite
inconsistent
with
the
overall
purpose
here
to
accomplish
that.
so
i
think
the
temporal
argument
doesn't
get
the
government
particularly
far.
i
would
like
to
take
a
second
to
talk
about
sort
what
i
think
is
an
important
distinction
between
635
and
other
provisions,
which
is
that
635(a)
imposes
a
duty
that,
as
the
secretary's
brief
i
think
elegantly
sets
out,
that
duty
means
that
you
have
to
make
sure
there
is
fair
market
value,
that
these
are
reasonable
rates,
and
that
was
not
done.
so
that's
the
violation
that
took
place.
then
the
question
is,
is
there
a
money-generating,
money-mandating
obligation
imposed
here.
and
there
it
seems
to
me
the
distinction
between
635(a),
which
says
nothing
about
liability,
and
635(b)
and
(c),
which
expressly
--
expressly
excludes
the
possibility
of
liability,
suggests
clearly
why
635(a)
ought
to
be
viewed
by
this
court
as
a
sufficient
--
as
creating
a
fair
inference,
is
what
the
court
said
in
mitchell
2,
a
fair
inference
under
these
--
under
these
particular
circumstances.
the
other
issue
that
we
have
put
on
the
table
that
the
government
didn't
actually
address
in
its
opening,
although
i
suspect--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
635(a)
creates
the
fiduciary
duties.
the
juxtaposition
of
(a)
to
(b)
and
(c)
demonstrates
that
that
duty
is
a
money-mandating
or
rights-creating
duty
that's
enforceable
under
the
indian
tucker
act,
justice
breyer.
the
other
duty,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
--
that
the
secretary
breached
there
is
the
duty
embedded
in
section
8
of
this
statute,
which
requires
him
to
make
disclosures
as
part
of
this
program.
and
the
one
thing
that
is
absolutely
clear
that
the
court
of
federal
claims
judged--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and
then--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
just
to
read
(b),
which
unfortunately
isn't
reproduced
i
don't
think
in
any
of
the
papers,
but
it
says:
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
land
owned
in
fee
simple
by
the
navajo
may
be
leased,
sold
or
otherwise
disposed
of
by
the
sole
authority
of
the
tribal
council
in
any
manner
that
similar
land
in
the
state
it's
situated
may
be
leased,
sold
or
otherwise
disposed
of
by
private
landowners,
and
the
--
such
disposition
shall
create
no
liability
on
the
part
of
the
united
states.
"
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
that
--
the
--
the
trust
relationship
doesn't
come
out
of
the
(b)
and
(c).
the
money-creating
component
of
it
it
seems
to
me
comes
out
of
(b)
and
(c).
the
trust
relationship
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
entirety
of
the
statute
was
enacted
to
implement
the
treaties,
that
these
are
all
lands
that
are
held
in
trust,
and
that
--
and
that
there
is
a
specific
duty
embedded
in
(a)
that
requires
that
the
secretary
approve
what
is
otherwise
basically
controlled
as
a
trust
arrangement,
and
that
that
is
then
implemented
through
regulations
that
require
the
secretary
to
do
this
under
a
fair
market
value
standard.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that's
for
the
sale
of
fee
simple
lands,
so
it's
dealing
with
a
very
different
set
of
--
of
circumstances,
which
is
talking
about
--
it's
aimed
clearly
at
a
different
set
of
properties
that
are
being
held
and
therefore
they
said,
when
you
engage
in
leases
for
that
kind
of
property
there
is
no
liability.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
a
fair
inference
i
think
is
all
that
i
have
to
demonstrate.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
wasn't
here
the
last
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
can
i
answer--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
there's
two
--
there
are
two
answers;
i
was
being
facetious
as
to
why
we
didn't
push
this
argument
the
last
time.
it
was
largely
because
the
federal
circuit
the
last
time
concluded
based
on
imla
alone
that
there
was
in
fact
a
sufficient
rights-creating
provision.
and
therefore
we
defended
that
part
of
the
judgment.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know
if
those
were
from
the
brief.
i
know
there
was
a
statement
of
undisputed
facts
in
the
first
round
of
the
litigation.
but
there
is
no
question
that
the
court
--
if
we
are
right,
that
the
court
remanded
to
--
for
consideration
consistent
with
this.
we
then
went
down
upon
remand
from
the
federal
circuit.
we
took
additional
discovery
and
we
obtained
the
information
that
we
got.
and
also,
remember,
the
united
states'
brief
in
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
says
that
this
was
approved
pursuant
to
the
rehabilitation
act
and
the
trust
responsibilities.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
was
an
overstatement,
there's
no
question.
based
on
what
we
knew
at
the
time,
we
thought
it
was
in
fact
an
imla
lease.
but
the
truth
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--is
it's
not
imla,
anyway.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
but
this
is
the
only
one
that
deals
specifically
with
the
navajo
reservation
and
deals
with
leasing
for
business
purposes
for
the
development
of
resources.
and
so
while
i
--
i
agree
with
you
in
one
sense,
the
other
one
has
a
--
has
some
superficial
closeness
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
closer
one
is
actually
the
provision
that
deals
with
this
specific
reservation
and
this
specific
type
of
a
lease
arrangement.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
either-or.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
--
we
obtained
additional
information,
certainly,
you
know.
we
have
the
udall
declaration
that
specifically
said
that
when
he
negotiated
this
lease
he
negotiated
it
as
the
centerpiece
of
the
navajo-hopi
rehabilitation
act
of
1950.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
was
after
the
first
time
around.
i
mean,
there
is
no
question
that
if
we
had
won
the
first
time
around,
we
would
have
stood
by
that
statement.
but,
having
lost
it
----
[laughter]
--there
is
a
tendency
to
focus
the
mind
elsewhere,
and
we
did.
but
the
reality
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
parties,
the
--
secretary
udall
specifically
says
this
was
adopted
pursuant
to
the
rehabilitation
act.
peabody
coal
company
in
briefing
in
the
arizona
courts
has
specifically
said
that
this
was
approved
under
the
rehabilitation
act,
and
the
united
states
government
itself
in
briefing
in
other
courts
has
said
that
this
was
approved
pursuant
to
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--obviously--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--he
has
a
good
memory,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
no,
justice
scalia,
i
understand
that.
but
the
--
the
bottom
line
here
is,
the
question
is,
is
this,
you
know
--
is
it
absolutely
clear
that
this
is
exclusively
an
imla
lease?
and
the
answer
to
that
is
there
is
a
lot
of
evidence
that
suggests
no.
it's
not
in
the
form
of
imla.
there
are
a
lot
from
other
statements
that
say
yes.
and
more
fundamentally,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
ought
not
to
view
it
as
an
either/or
proposition.
it
could
be
adopted
under
imla
or
it
could
be
adopted
separately.
so
the
section
8
argument--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't
know
that
it's
a
factual
question.
it
is
that,
candidly,
we
obviously
focused
more
on
imla
because
the
federal
circuit
sort
of
--
first
of
all,
the
court
of
federal
claims
in
the
first
go-around
adopted
imla
as
the
test
and
just
said
you
lose
because
you
don't
have
an
imla
lease
here.
and
we
had
argued
there
that
it's
not
just
an
imla
lease.
then
we
went
to
the
federal
circuit
and
we
won
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
--
that
imla
controlled
here
and
we
should
prevail
on
that
basis.
when
it
was
sent
back
down
and
we
obviously
didn't
have
imla
available,
since
the
federal
circuit
specifically
precluded
us
from
any
further
reliance
on
imla,
and
looked
at
the
other
provisions,
we
tried
to
understand
their
context,
and
then
that
--
all
i'm
trying
to
do
is
explain
why
it
is
that
we
would
suddenly
focus
more
on
the
navajo
act,
not
to
say
that
you
couldn't
read
the
statute
and
say
it
would
necessarily
apply
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
last
part
about--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
would
go
back
to
justice
alito's
first
question
to
mr.
kneedler,
which
was,
this
provision
has
a
duty,
doesn't
it,
because
it
has
an
approval
requirement?
and
the
answer
is
yes,
this
court
in
navajo
1
looked
further
at
imla,
at
that
specific
statute,
and
concluded
that
that
statute
overall
had
a
very
significant
limitation
embedded
in
that
duty;
and
the
question
is,
is
there
anything
in
the
rehabilitation
act
that
has
that
same
limitation?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
my
answer
to
that
is
no,
there
is
nothing
in
it;
and
contrary
to
the
overall
intent
of
imla,
which
was
to
guarantee
self-sufficiency,
the
overall
intent
of
this
statute
was
to
allow
the
navajo
to
come
somewhere
in
the
area
of
the
standards.
in
addition
to
that,
i
do
think
there
are
regulations
that
do
require
the
secretary
to
invoke
a
fair
market
value
assessment
of
the
rates
that
are
embedded
in
this
lease,
and
that
he
did
not
--
and
he
clearly
did
not
do
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
--
i
think
the
key
to
that
is
--
is
sort
of
two-fold.
one,
i
think
when
you
--
in
the
absence
of
some
clear
statement
in
this
statute
akin
to
the
one
that
existed
in
imla
that
reduces
the
duty
of
the
united
states,
that
the
court
ought
to
then
simply
examine
this
against
the
background
of
the
trust
principles
and
say
you
have
a
duty,
you
ought
to
exercise
your
duty
consistent
with
your
role
as
a
trustee,
and
you
ought
to
--
you
ought
to
be
acting
in
the
best
interests
of
the
navajo
nation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
then
the
second
--
i
mean,
if
you
are
not
prepared
to
accept
the
general
trust
principles,
although
again
they
go
through
the
context
of
a
specific
imposed
duty
that
--
that
635(a)
has
in
the
first
instance.
but
even
if
you
want
to
go
beyond
that,
then
i
go
to
635(b)
and
(c),
where
congress
clearly
seems
to
have
in
mind
the
possibility
of
not
having
liability
imposed
in
certain
circumstances
and
yet
left
635(a)
there
without
a
similar
protection
for
the
united
states,
which,
again,
may
not
be
the
compelled
inference,
but
it
certainly
seems
to
me
to
create
a
fair
inference.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
unless
you
are
saying
that
--
i
don't
know
in
what
context,
mr.
chief
justice,
you're
talking
about.
i
mean
--
but
to
be
sure,
lawyers
don't
want
to
read
it
that
way
because
they
are
in
litigation
right
now.
but
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
statutory
scheme
or
in
the
regulatory
scheme
that
would
say
that.
and
certainly,
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
secretary's
brief,
in
their
analysis
of
the
regulatory
scheme,
the
--
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
this
--
page
25
to
26,
where
they
point
out
that
there
was
a
gap
where
--
where
the
secretary
did
not
exclude
mineral
leasing
from
the
635--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--he's
totally
on
board
with
us,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
that's
out
of
the
brief.
i'll
just
conclude
with
the
section
8
argument,
which
is
to
recognize
that
the
secretary
did
owe
a
duty
of
candor
and
disclosure
embedded
in
section
8.
that
program
did
not
end.
that
disclosure
responsibility
did
not
end.
what
the
measure
of
damages
for
that
breach
of
duty
is
a
question
that
obviously
is
still
open
on
remand.
but
the
notion
that
the
secretary
can
behave
the
way
the
secretary
did
in
this
case,
which
is
to
know
that
he
was
not
going
to
take
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
final
decision,
command
that
no
decision
be
made,
leave
the
navajo
in
a
state
of
distress
under
those
circumstances,
force
them
to
negotiate
with
one
hand
tied
behind
their
back
at
a
minimum,
and
then
ended
up
an
agreement
that
was
half
what
the
fair
market
value
would
have
been
for
the
quality
of
coal,
is
an
outrage
and
the
court
ought
to
allow
the
damages
action
to
go
forward.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
urge
the
court
to
affirm.
