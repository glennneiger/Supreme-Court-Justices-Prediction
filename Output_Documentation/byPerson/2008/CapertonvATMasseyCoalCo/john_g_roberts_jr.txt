chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-22,
caperton
v.
massey
coal
company.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
"probability"
is
a
loose
term.
what
--
what
percentage
is
probable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you've
a
50
percent
chance
of
bias,
a
10
percent
chance,
probable
means
more
than
50?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if,
instead
of
having
the
focus
on
one,
we're
dealing
with
a
trade
group
that's
making
the
donation.
ten
companies
form
a
trade
group.
is
the
judge
recused
in
the
case
of
every
one
of
those
companies?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
just
take
this
case,
the
same
amount
of
money,
except
it's
not
from
an
individual,
not
from
that
individual's
company,
but
from
ten
different
ones,
and
divide
it
up
by
ten.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
okay.
now,
i'm
sure
you
know
where
i'm
going
next.
what
if
it's
five
companies
in
the
trade
group?
when
do
you
decide
that
there's
a
probability?
i
take
it
if
there
are
two
companies,
under
your
theory
there
would
be
a
probability
of
bias?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
could
i
stop
you
right
there?
"when
their
case
is
pending"
--
the
massey
company
has
a
lot
of
cases
pending.
so
is
it
only
those
cases
that
were
pending
on
the
day
of
the
election?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
we
shouldn't
talk
about
pending
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
the
whole
distinction
that
your
friend
on
the
other
side
makes.
those
cases
involve
financial
interest,
and
the
recusal
rules
are,
you
know,
if
you
have
one
share
of
at&t
stock
and
it's
in
at&t,
you
have
to
recuse.
but
this
is
different.
this
is
a
probability
of
bias,
not
financial
interest.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
united
mine
workers?
if
they
give
a
contribution
to
somebody's
campaign,
is
that
judge
then
recused
in
every
labor
case?
or
--
i
don't
know
if
they
give
contributions
or
not,
but
a
group
like
mothers
against
drunk
driving,
because
they
think
the
other
judge
is
too
lenient
in
dwi
cases,
so
they
give
contributions.
is
their
preferred
judge
recused
in
every
dwi
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
are
those
all
factors
and
circumstances
we
have
to
look
at?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
so
if
there's
a
big
--
a
big
united
mine
workers
case,
or
not
even
united
mine
workers,
involving
particular
union
members,
and
the
umw
gives
large
contributions
to
a
judge,
that
--
that
judge
is
recused?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--are
the
states
--
are
the
states
really
free
to
do
that?
we
have
recognized
first
amendment
interests
in
participating
in
the
electoral
process
before.
i
mean,
would
your
approach
constitutionalize
mccain-feingold
at
a
state
level?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
this--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
frey,
why
don't
you
take
a
shot
at
answering
it?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
olson,
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
about
protective
donations?
you
actually
give,
not
three
million,
but
a
couple
hundred
thousand
to
somebody
you
don't
want
deciding
your
case.
and
it
comes
up,
and
you
say,
you
have
to
recuse
yourself
because--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
how
do
you
know?
i
mean,
are
you
saying
it's
going
to
be
clear
in
every
case
that
a
judge
is
going
to
rule
against
the
particular
entity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
a
reasonable
person
that's
making
that
inquiry,
is
that
the
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
would
a
reasonable
person
think
it's
a
ground
for
recusal
if
the
lawyer
and
the
judge
were
very
close
friends?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
think
so?
a
reasonable
person
comes
up
and
says,
they're--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--they
socialize
all
the
time,
you
know,
they
were
at
each
other's
weddings,
whatever
it
is,
we
know
that
that's
not
a
basis
for
recusal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
