justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
mr.
olson,
the
very
fact
that
they
do
raises
what
i
think
is
one
of
the
difficult
issues
in
this
case,
and
it's
raised
by
--
specifically
by
the
brief
of
--
excuse
me
--
the
nine
states,
alabama
and
so
on.
and
--
and
i
would
put
it
this
way.
it's
not
exactly
the
way
that
brief
did,
but
i
see
the
problem
that
you
are
--
that
you
are
addressing
as
--
as
not
only
a
procedural,
but
certainly
to
a
degree
a
substantive
due
process
kind
of
problem.
one
of
the
factors
that
goes
into
the
recognition
of
at
least
a
substantive
limitation
when
there
has
been
none
before
is
--
is
the
issue
of
timing.
is
the
political
process
in
fact
working
now
toward
a
solution?
because
if
it
is,
that
kind
of
ethos
of
total
unreasonability
is
--
is
still
being
worked
out,
and
--
and
the
courts
ought
to
stay
their
hand.
so
my
question
is,
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that
there
is
a
political
process
going
on
addressing
this
issue?
and
i
forget
the
details,
but
my
recollection
is
that
it
may
well
have
been
that
brief
pointed
out
that
the
state
of
west
virginia
itself
has
enacted
some
legislation
since
these
events
began
to
transpire.
so
the
nub
of
the
question
is,
is
the
political
process
in
process
and
is
that
a
good
reason
for
us
to
stay
our
hand
in
recognizing
a
new
procedural
or
substantive
due
process
right
at
this
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
think
we
all
recognize
that.
is
there
--
is
there
a
counter-political
process
going
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
happened
in
west
virginia?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
my
recollection
correct
that
west
virginia
has,
in
fact,
enacted
some
kind
of
limiting
legislation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
not
be
per
se
unconstitutional,
but
it
is
certainly
one
contributing
factor,
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
argument
that
the
system
that
we
have
depended
on
up
to
this
point
is
not
working
very
well.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
although
you
never
directly
--
i
don't
think
you
ever
directly
answered
it,
i
--
i
understood
you
to
imply
in
response
to
justice
stevens
that
there
would
be
no
appearance
problem
that
would
ever
justify
a
constitutional
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
in
fact,
if
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
and
we
have
--
we
have
an
appearance
standard
under
the
aba
canons,
but
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
make
a
very
convincing
argument
that
that
standard
was
effective
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
--
it's
the
matter
of
opinion
that
brings
the
case
before
us.
and
would
you
agree
--
i
am
not
--
i
am
not
asking
you
to
agree
that
the
aba
standard
was
violated.
that's
not
what
you're
here
for.
but
would
you
agree
that
the
aba
standard
is
certainly
implicated
by
the
facts
of
this
case,
whatever
the
ultimate
recusal
decision
should
have
been?
justice
david
h.
souter
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
frey,
you've
tried
a
couple
of
times
to
get
to
--
to
your
--
your
point
that,
even
if
we
assume
probability
of
bias
is
the
standard,
the
debt
of
gratitude
would
not
qualify.
i'll
be
candid
with
--
to
say
that
i
don't
see
why
probability
of
bias
is
necessarily
an
inappropriate
constitutional
standard,
whether
we
should
adopt
it
or
not.
but
would
you
give
your
argument
on
why
the
debt
of
gratitude
could
not
qualify?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
that
may
illustrate
the
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
i
know
what
common
law
--
how
much
help
common
law
is.
common
law
didn't
have
elected
judges.
justice
david
h.
souter
common
law
did
not
have
this
contribution
system--
justice
david
h.
souter
--which
your
colleague
referred
to
as
spiraling
out
of
control.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
take
it
as
the
principle,
but
i
take
it
as
an
application
of
the
principle.
and
i
thought
if
you
get
to
responding
to
the
application,
i
may
understand
your
position
better
on
the
principle.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
long
has
massey
been
in
business,
eight
years?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
one
is
going
to
go
into
that
calculation,
one
is
going
to
assume
that
in
eight
years,
there's
going
to
be
another
three
million
dollars
waiting
to
be
spent.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
one
has
hopes.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
one
has
hopes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
that
and
i
say
that
because
we
took
corporate
law.
but
in
--
in
terms
of
my
brother
a
moment
ago
spoke
of
we've
been
around
washington
for
a
while,
and
i
don't
think
that
fine
distinction
counts
very
much
on
the
issue
that
we've
got.
justice
david
h.
souter
we'll
have
to
see
when
the
next
election
comes
along.
[laughter]
an
expectation
has
been
created
that
if
there
is
an
interest,
the
money
will
be
spent--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
it
seems
to
me
that
underlies
justice
breyer's
analysis
just
as
it
does
mine.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
all
have
not
had
the
three
million.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
with
respect,
your
--
justice
breyer
dissociated
his
question
from
debt
of
gratitude.
i
understand
you
--
you
are
arguing
against
a
debt
of
gratitude
theory,
but
if
i
recall
his
question,
it
was
not
based
upon
the
debt
of
gratitude
theory.
