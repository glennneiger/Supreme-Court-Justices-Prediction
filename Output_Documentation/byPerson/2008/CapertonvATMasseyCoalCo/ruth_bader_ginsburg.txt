justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
mean
the
same
thing
as
likelihood
of
bias?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
what
extent
do
you
rely
on
--
and
this
is
a
very
unusual
situation
--
that
you
have
a
defendant
in
the
ongoing
litigation
who
is
in
fact
a
prime
culprit
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
plaintiff?
that
is,
blankenship,
who
made
all
these
contributions,
is
charged
with
driving
caperton
out
of
business.
so
he
is
not
simply
the
ceo
of
the
company
that's
named
as
the
defendant,
but
he
is
targeted
as
the
perpetrator.
so
that's
an
--
an
additional
factor.
is
that
just
one
of
a
laundry
list,
or
is
that
central
to
your
view
that
there
is
really
an
appearance
of
impropriety
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
it
--
is
it
--
this
court's
decision
in
republican
party
of
minnesota
said
that
judges
could
say
anything,
just
as
a
legislator.
are
you
extending
that
notion
that
an
election
is
an
election
to
this
area
of
the
appearance
of
impropriety?
i
mean,
is
it
your
position
that
the
judge
is
elected
just
like
a
legislator
is
elected,
and
legislators
all
the
time
are
beholden
to
interest
groups?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
the
view
that
benjamin
should
not
be
the
judge
of
his
own
cause?
wasn't
--
wasn't
it
--
it
was
either
massey,
the
company,
or
blankenship
that
brought
a
1983
action
insisting
on
that
very
point,
that
in
recusal
matter--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--wasn't
--
well,
maybe
you
can
tell
me
what
that
1983
suit
was.
it
was
a
charge
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it
was
the
position
that
blankenship
took?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
please
clarify
that?
because
i
was
taking
"appearance",
"likelihood",
"probability"
as
all
synonyms,
and
i
think
of
justice
marshall's
decision
in
peters
and
kiff,
involving
a
grand
jury,
and
he
said
that
due
process
is
denied
in
circumstances
creating
the
likelihood
or
the
appearance
of
bias.
and
there
are
other
decisions,
too,
that
use
those
terms
interchangeably.
so
i
don't
know
that
"probability
of
bias",
"likelihood
of
bias",
"appearance"
--
that
--
those
seem
to
me
synonyms.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
--
i
mean,
there
were
a
few
recusal
motions
in
this
case.
judge,
i
think
it
was,
matthew
moved
to
disqualify
judge
starcher,
and
judge
starcher
did
indeed
recuse
himself.
he
had
spoken
out
against
what
went
on
here.
if
he
had
refused
to
recuse
after
speaking
out
as
he
did,
would
that
be
compatible
with
due
process,
the
due
process
owed
to
the
massey
company?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
animosity
was
directed
at
judge
benjamin?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
think
that
the
constitution
might
have
been
violated
if
starcher
--
you
think
due
process
might
have
been
violated
if
that
judge
had
remained
on
the
bench?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
don't
deal
with
an
abstract
setting.
we
have
the
setting
of
elections,
of
elections
of
judges
and
millions
of
dollars
spent
on
them.
that's
the
context
in
which
this
case
arises.
