justice
antonin
scalia
who
says?
have
we
ever
held
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
guarantee
against
even--
justice
antonin
scalia
--"has
always
endeavored".
justice
antonin
scalia
"has
always
endeavored".
the
truth
--
"has
always
endeavored".
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
are
rules
in
the
states
that
do
endeavor
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
claim
that
there
is
such
a
temptation
here
because
of
gratitude?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
been
around
washington
a
long
time.
how
far
do
you
think
gratitude
goes
in
--
in
the
general
political
world?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
--
that
person
contributed
money
to
my
election
because
he
expected
me
to
be
a
fair
and
impartial
judge,
and
i
would
be
faithful
to
that
contributor
only
by
being
a
fair
and
impartial
judge.
that
is
showing
gratitude.
i
should
do
what
he
expected
me
to
do,
and
i
have
no
reason
to
think
he
expected
me
to
lie
and
distort
cases
in
order
to
come
out
his
way.
what
i
expected
he
wanted
me
to
do
was
to
be
a
good
judge,
and
i'm
being
faithful
to
him,
and
i'm
--
i'm
showing
my
gratitude
by
--
by
being
a
good
judge.
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
isn't
a
matter
of
honor
and
sacrifice.
you
talk
as
though
what
gratitude
consists
of
is
coming
out
in
favor
of
this
fellow,
but
that
is
not
necessarily
what
gratitude
consists
of.
gratitude
consists
of
performing
the
way
this
person
would
like
me
to
perform.
now,
in
this
case,
i
will
acknowledge
that
you
seem
to
have
a
contribution
based
upon
more.
this
contributor
never
even
met
the
judge,
did
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
certainly
not
good
buddies.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
his
contributions,
as
i
understand
it,
were
mainly
based
upon
his
opposition
to
the
incumbent,
who
he
thought
was
an
activist
judge
that
--
that
was
distorting
the
tort
law
of
the
state,
all
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs'
bar.
and
if
--
if
the
contribution
were
to
engender
any
gratitude,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
simply
be
that
this
other
candidate
would
do
what
he
promised
in
his
campaign
and
that
is
not
be
an
activist
judge
and
not
distort
the
tort
law
of
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
they
don't
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
only
two
categories
of
cases,
only
two
categories.
one
--
one
is
where
the
judge
is
almost
the
aggrieved
party
in
conducting
contempt
proceedings
against
someone
who
is
contemptuous
of
that
very
judge,
and
the
other
one
is
cases
where
the
judges
have
a
financial
interest.
that's
far
from
this
broad
category
of
whenever
there
is
a
possibility
of
bias.
i
was
appointed
to
the
bench
by
ronald
reagan.
should
i
be
any
--
should
i
have
been
any
less
grateful
to
ronald
reagan
than
--
than
the
judge
here
was
grateful
to
the
person
who
spent
a
lot
of
money
in
his
election?
justice
antonin
scalia
two
categories
are
the
only
categories
in
which
it
has
applied
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
broad--
justice
antonin
scalia
--nice,
clear,
and
true.
are
you
going
to
tell
me
why
i
shouldn't
have
been
grateful
to
ronald
reagan?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
had
a
lot
of
--
a
lot
of
issues
coming
before
me
while
his
presidency
continued.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
their
standard
the
same
as
yours?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
frankly--
justice
antonin
scalia
--one
of
the
problems
in
this
case.
the
various
amici
and
--
and
you
come
up
with,
you
know,
a
wide
divergence
of
standards.
and
all
of
them
say:
by
the
way,
these
seven
factors
or
five
factors
or
six
factors,
whatever
they
say,
are
not
exhaustive;
there
may
be
others
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
the
only
central
factor.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
it's
one
central
factor.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
have
no
test
other
than
probability
of
bias.
we
can't
--
we
can't
run
a
system
on
--
on
such
a
vague
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
--
not
for
situations
that
have
such
an
infinite
variety
as
--
as
the
appointment
of
judges
and
the
election
of
judges
and
--
and
funding
your
opponent
or
--
or
declining
to
fund
or
joining
some
agglomeration
of
--
of
other
institutions
that
fund.
the
--
the
variety
is
immense,
and
you
give
us
nothing
to
hang
onto
except,
you
know,
case
by
case
we're
going
to
have
to
decide
whether
there's
a
probability
of
bias.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
it
would
be
easier
to
solve
the
problem,
as
some
states
have
done,
not
by
having
this
--
this
raffle
for
--
for
whatever
judge
gets
--
gets
stricken
from
the
case
or
not,
but
simply
limiting
the
amount
of
contributions
that
can
be
made?
isn't
--
isn't
that
a
much
more
sensible
solution?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
some
of
them
are
doing
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i
thought
they
closed
the
527
loophole
that
allowed
him
to
contribute
so
much
above
the
individual
limit.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
we
adopted
his
principle,
did
we,
in
the
obscenity
area?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
appearance
standard
is
--
is
wonderfully
ratchetable.
once
it
is
clearly
established
that
a
certain
--
a
certain
set
of
facts
creates
the
appearance
of
impropriety
that
is
solidly
established,
then
the
set
of
facts
right
next
to
that
suddenly
acquires
the
appearance
of
impropriety
because
it's
so
--
it's
so
close
to
what
is
obviously
improper.
and
--
and
so
we
go
down
and
down
and
down.
and
i
--
i
personally
don't
favor
a
constitutional
rule
that
is
a
sliding
scale
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
have
no
choice
with
regard
to
the
reasonableness
standard.
we
--
it's
not
a
standard
we
made
up--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
we
would
have
been
making
up
this
one.
it's
there
in
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
to
make
the
most
of
it,
do
the
best
we
can
do
with
it.
but
here
we're
being
urged
to
adopt
out
of
nowhere
a
new
standard
of
probability
of
bias.
that's
not
in
the
constitution,
and
it's
perfectly
valid
to
ask,
is
that
a
sensible
standard?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
to
finally
get
to
discussing
the
debt
of
gratitude
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
i've
been
waiting
and
waiting.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
matter
what
language
you
use
because
it's
pretty
vague
anyway
--
"probability",
"likelihood",
"appearance"
--
it
doesn't
really--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
really
anxious
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
on
debt
of
gratitude.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
i
mean,
if
your
response
to
the
first
question
is
judges
have
lifetime
tenure,
you
then
can't
respond
to
the
second
question
would
it
make
a
difference
if
he
was
term-limited
by
saying,
no,
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference.
