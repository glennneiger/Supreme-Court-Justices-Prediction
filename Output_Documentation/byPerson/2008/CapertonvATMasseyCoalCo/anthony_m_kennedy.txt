justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
my
--
my
question
in
this
case
is
this:
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
you
said
that,
well,
by
the
time
you
came
here
you
would
have
a
standard
for
us
that
we
can
work
with.
you
know,
all
of
us
know,
that
a
ruling
in
your
favor
means
that
law
and
motion
practice
will
--
could
--
could
change
drastically
in
states
all
across
the
country.
disqualification
for
bias
will
now
become
a
--
a
part
of
the
pretrial
process,
and
i'm
asking
you
what
your
standard
is.
your
standard
is
an
unacceptable
risk
of
impropriety
or
perception
of
bias,
but
i
--
i
need
some
more
specific
standards
within
which
to
fit
this
case.
you
give
a
general
standard,
and
then
we
hear
about
the
amount
of
the
contribution.
we
hear
about
the
fact
that
it
was
a
contested
election,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
--
your
standard
of
--
of
impropriety
doesn't,
it
seems
to
me,
give
sufficient
--
or
"unacceptable
risk
of
bias"
doesn't
give
sufficient
guidance
to
the
courts
to
implement
this
rule,
unless
it's
just
--
it's
just
going
to
be
one
case.
now,
i
know
the
law
evolves
on
a
case-by-case
system.
i
understand
that,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
standard
you
offer
us
is
specific
enough.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
you
to
articulate
some
substandards
that
have
--
that
are
general
in
nature,
that
apply
to
this
case,
substandards
that
are
more
specific
than
the
probability
of
bias.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
you
to
be
able
to
elaborate
your
full
theory
of
the
case,
but
just
so
you
know,
it
--
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
appearance
standard
has
--
has
much
to
recommend
it.
in
part
it
means
that
you
don't
have
to
inquire
into
the
actual
bias;
it's
--
it's
more
objective.
now,
of
course,
it
has
to
be
controlled.
it
has
to
be
precise.
but
i
just
thought
that
you
know
that
i
--
i
did
have
that
inclination.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we're
asking
--
but
we're
asking
what
substance
we
can
give
to
the
constitutional
protection.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
think
you're
quite
right
in
the
way
you
describe
tumey,
but
i
wonder
why
is
that
the
reason
--
why
is
appearance
never
constitutional?
why
should
that
be?
can
you
talk
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
our
whole
system
is
designed
to
ensure
confidence
in
our
judgments.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
--
it
seems
to
me
litigants
have
an
entitlement
to
that
under
the
due
process
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
debt
of
gratitude
--
we
keep
asking
but
your
time
is
running
out.
have
you
said
what
you
need
to
say
on
debt
of
gratitude?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
case
to
announce
is
caperton
versus
a.t.
massey
coal
company,
no.
08-22.
the
case
concerns
whether
the
due
process
clause
requires
a
judge
to
recuse
himself
when
a
person
with
a
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
case
had
a
significant
and
disproportionate
influence
in
placing
the
judge
on
the
case.
in
2002,
a
west
virginia
jury
in
a
state
court
returned
the
verdict
that
found
respondent
massey
coal
company
liable
in
a
civil
suit.
the
jury
awarded
petitioner,
hugh
caperton
$50
million
in
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
don
blankenship
is
massey
coals'
chairman,
president
and
ceo.
massey
coal
had
been
the
defendant
before
the
jury.
after
the
verdict
--
before
appeal,
west
virginia
held
its
2004
judicial
elections,
knowing
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
west
virginia
would
consider
the
appeal
in
this
case.
blankenship
decided
to
support
brent
benjamin
to
replace
an
incumbent
judgment
on
the
state's
highest
court.
in
total,
blankenship
contributed
some
$3
million
to
get
benjamin
elected.
and
to
provide
some
perspective,
blankenship's
contributions
were
more
than
the
total
amount
spent
by
all
other
benjamin
supporters
and
three
times
the
amount
spent
by
benjamin's
own
campaign
committee.
justice
benjamin
won
the
election
by
50,000
votes.
when
the
state
court's
highest
court
decided
to
hear
massey
coal's
appeal,
caperton
moved
to
disqualify
now
justice
benjamin
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
based
on
the
conflict
clause
by
blankenship's
campaign
involvement.
justice
benjamin
denied
that
motion.
and
the
state
court
ruled
three-to-two
in
favor
of
blankenship
and
massey
coal
with
justice
benjamin
casting
the
deciding
vote.
then
there
was
a
petition
for
rehearing.
after
two
justices
recuse
themselves,
the
court
granted
rehearing.
justice
benjamin
though
twice
more
refused
to
recuse
himself.
the
newly
constituted
court
again
voted
three-to-two
to
overturn
the
$50
million
jury
verdict
again
with
justice
benjamin
casting
the
deciding
vote.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
justice
benjamin
was
constitutionally
required
to
recuse
himself.
we
conclude
and
we
now
hold
that
his
recusal
was
required
by
the
constitution
requirement
of
due
process.
at
the
outset,
we
note
that
justice
benjamin
was
careful
to
address
the
recusal
motions
and
explained
his
reasons
why
disqualification
was
not
in
order.
he
conducted
--
justice
benjamin
conducted
a
probing
inquiry
into
his
actual
motives
and
inclinations
and
he
found
none
to
be
improper,
and
we
do
not
question
his
subjective
findings
of
impartially.
nor
do
we
determine
whether
there
was
actual
bias.
judge
benjamin
properly
undertook
an
extensive
search
for
actual
bias.
but
as
our
prior
cases
have
indicated,
this
is
just
one
step
in
the
judicial
process.
due
process
may
sometimes
require
recusal
whether
or
not
actual
bias
exists
or
can
be
proved.
the
difficulties
of
inquiring
into
actual
bias
and
the
fact
that
the
inquiries
often
a
private
one
simply
underscore
the
need
for
objective
rules.
otherwise,
there
may
be
no
adequate
protection
against
the
judge
who
simply
misreads
or
misapprehends
the
real
motives
at
work
in
deciding
the
case.
the
judge's
only
inquiry
into
actual
bias
then
is
not
one
that
the
law
can
easily
superintend
or
review.
of
course
actual
bias
if
disclosed.
no
doubt
would
be
grounds
for
appropriate
relief.
in
lieu
of
exclusive
reliance
on
that
personal
inquiry
or
another
appellate
review
of
the
judge's
determination
respecting
actual
bias,
the
due
process
clause
has
been
implemented
by
objective
standards
that
do
not
require
proof
of
actual
bias.
in
defining
the
standards,
the
court
has
asked
whether
under
a
realistic
appraisal
of
psychological
tendencies
and
human
weakness,
the
interest
poses
such
a
risk
of
actual
bias
or
prejudgment
that
the
practice
must
be
forbidden
if
the
guarantee
of
due
process
is
to
be
adequately
implemented.
turning
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
conclude
that
there
is
a
serious
risk
of
actual
bias
based
on
objective
and
reasonable
perceptions.
here,
a
person
with
a
personal
stake
in
a
particular
case
had
a
significant
and
disproportionate
influence
in
placing
the
judge
on
the
case
by
making
campaign
contributions.
and
this
was
all
when
the
case
was
pending.
to
be
sure
not
every
--
or
eminent
--
to
be
sure
not
every
campaign
contributions
by
a
litigant
or
attorney
creates
a
probability
of
bias
that
requires
a
judge's
recusal.
but
this
is
an
exceptional
case.
blankenship
contributed
$3
million
to
get
benjamin
elected.
his
contributions
eclipsed
the
total
amount
spent
by
all
other
--
spent
by
all
other
benjamin
supporters
and
exceeded
by
300%
the
amount
spent
by
benjamin's
committee.
the
risk
blankenship's
influence
engendered
actual
bias
is
sufficiently
substantial
but
it
must
be
forbidden
if
the
guarantee
of
due
process
is
to
be
adequately
implemented.
the
facts
before
us
are
extreme
by
any
measure.
and
state
and
federal
codes
of
judicial
conduct
impose
more
rigorous
standards
than
due
process
requires.
and
as
a
result,
most
disputes
of
a
disqualification
can
resolve
without
resort
to
the
constitution.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
west
virginia
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceeding
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia,
thomas,
and
alito
have
joined.
and
justice
scalia
has
also
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
