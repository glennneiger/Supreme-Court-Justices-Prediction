but
that
isn't
the
only
theory.
that
is,
in
my
own
mind
--
i
don't
know
if
you
want
to
call
it
"probability"
or
"possibility",
you
don't
manacle
a
defendant
in
a
courtroom
even
though
this
jury
may
not
have
been
affected.
i
read
the
opinion
justice
benjamin
wrote.
it
was
a
very
good
opinion.
i
sympathized
with
his
problem.
okay?
so
i'm
not
talking
about
him.
i'm
talking
about
we
don't
manacle
defendants
because
many
jurors,
maybe
not
this
one,
would
have
been
affected,
and
that
seems
the
problem
here.
the
debt
of
gratitude
i
think,
no,
that
isn't
the
theory
that
underlies
it,
though
it
may
in
part.
it's
that
you
have
here
the
largest
amount
by
a
factor
--
an
order
of
magnitude
perhaps,
i
mean
hugely
greater
than
any
other
contribution
given
to
a
judge
by
a
single
person.
it
doesn't
just
affect
the
fast
through
gratitude.
a
normal
human
being
also
thinks,
if
i
play
my
cards
right,
maybe
it
will
be
repeated,
and
they'll
want
to
keep
me
in
office.
and
we
have
the
fact
of
how
it
looks,
and
we
don't
have
a
situation
where
the
something
like
this
is
inevitable,
where
you
appoint
judges.
it's
inevitable
that
there
will
be
an
appointment.
i
mean,
hey,
but
that
isn't
true
of
sitting
on
this
kind
of
case.
so
we
have
all
those
things
that
make
it
extreme.
so
what
is
the
problem?
if
we
say
there
is
an
envelope
that
the
due
process
clause
doesn't
touch,
and
that
envelope
is
greater,
and
we
touch
less,
if
the
states
are
regulating
it
themselves.
where
they're
not
--
and
this
is
way
outside
the
envelope
--
at
that
point
the
due
process
clause
comes
into
play.
now,
end
of
opinion.
now,
what
terrible
mess
will
the
court
get
into
if
they
write
just
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
logical
principle
or,
i
thought,
if
i
was
mentioning,
all
those
things
that
might
lead
a
judge
in
the
future,
because
of
the
size,
in
the
past,
because
of
the
size,
in
the
fact
that
it's
a
single
individual,
in
the
fact
that
there's
a
case
coming
up
that's
likely
that
the
judge
will
decide
--
all
those
things
that
are
listed
by
the
chief
justices
in
their
brief,
all
those
things
together
make
it
a
serious
risk
that
there
will
be
bias,
even
though
an
individual
might
not
be.
there
is
a
serious
risk.
call
it
a
"probability";
call
it
an
"appearance".
use
the
language
that
you
want,
but
put
them
together,
and
they
spell
"mother".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
don't
you
understand
what
i
mean?
i'm
not
worried
about
what
you
call
"probability"--
