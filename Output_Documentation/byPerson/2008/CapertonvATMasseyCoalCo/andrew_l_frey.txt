mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first
of
all,
just
on
the
west
virginia
statutory
amendment,
they
did,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
close
the
527
loophole
and
limit
contributions
by
individuals
to
527
groups
to
$1,000
after
the
2004
election
in
response
to
the
concern
about
the
amount
of
money
that
was
being
spent
through
527
groups
in
that
election.
so
i
think
this
is
a
situation
where
the
states
are
dealing
with
it
legislatively
and,
and
as
i
hope
to
get
to
in
a
minute
or
two,
the
court
has
recognized
that
this
is
--
repeatedly
recognized
that
this
is
something
that
is
meant
to
be
dealt
with
through
legislative
or
canons
of
judicial
ethics
or
codes--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--not
through--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
of
course
i
don't
agree
that
justice
benjamin
was
in
the
least
beholden
to
anybody
in
this
case.
but
the
republican
party
case
was
a
case
about
the
first
amendment
right
of
candidates
in
an
election
to
speak
their
position
on
issues.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
follow
what
this
has
to
do
with
this
case.
but
i
will
say
that
this
is
not
a
case
about
appearances.
the
petition
was
about
appearances.
they've
--
the
other
side
has
withdrawn
or
it
has
abandoned
an
appearance
argument,
and
with
good
reason
because
the
due
process
clause--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
we
might
have
appearance
of
impropriety
overlapping
with
conditions
that
would
justify--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
we
are.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
saying
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not
exist
to
protect
the
integrity
or
reputation
of
the
state
judicial
systems.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
thought
i
said--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--if
you
were
--
if
--
if
you
thought
there
was
no
basis
for
believing
there
was
actual
bias,
but
it
looked
bad--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
i
don't--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
i
don't
think
just
appearance
could
ever
raise
a
due
process
issue.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
question
is
whether
there
is
actual
bias
of
a
kind
that
is
recognized
as
disqualifying.
the
court
has
recognized--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
would
take
exception
to
the
characterization
of
this
case
as
"extreme".
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
hope
to
address
that
question.
let
me
start
off
by
pointing
out,
as
justice
benjamin
said
in
his
opinion
on
discussing
the
recusal
issue,
his
july
opinion,
which
i
commend
to
the
court,
he
is
being
asked
to
recuse
on
the
basis
of
activities
of
a
third
party
over
which
he
had
no
control,
in
a
case
whose
disposition
offers
him
no
current
or
future
personal
benefit,
and
where
he
has
no
personal
connection
with
the
parties
or
their
counsel,
has
expressed
no
opinion
about
any
of
them.
he
has
done
nothing
that
would
call
into
question
his
objectivity
and
his
impartiality.
i
think
that's
a
very
important
point.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes,
it
challenged
the
procedure.
that's
not
an
issue
that's
before
the
court
here,
and
our
--
our
position
today
is
that
this
court
has
consistently
allowed
recusal
matters
to
be
decided
by
a
--
the
single
justice
who
is
challenged.
i
don't
think
the
court
thinks
it's
unconstitutional
to
do
that.
i
understand
the
--
the
concerns
about
having
the
judge
making
the
decision
about
whether
recusal
is
required,
but
that
is
not
the
practice
of
this
court,
and
if
it's
not
the
practice
of
this
court,
i
frankly
doubt
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
was
--
no,
not
blankenship.
massey.
massey--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
the
system
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
agree
that
the
system
is
not
working
well.
i
mean,
of
course
there
are
adjustments--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes,
but--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
appearances
--
but
appearances
--
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you
if
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
appearance
is
a
standard
for
recusal,
a
nonconstitutional
statutory
standard
for
recusal
in
virtually
every
state,
so
we
already
have
--
and
in
the
federal
system,
so--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
that
--
that's
a
matter
of
opinion.
i
--
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
i
would
agree
that
reasonable
people
could
have
a
different
view
one
way
or
the
other
about
whether
there
is
an
appearance
of
impropriety
for
justice
benjamin
sitting.
i
would
agree
with
that.
i
don't
think
i
would
go
further
than
that
because
my
personal
view
is
that
there
was
no
impropriety,
that
it
was
reasonable,
and
if
you
read
his
opinion
i
think
you'll
see
a
--
a
fair,
balanced,
thoughtful
statement
of
the
reasons
why
he
feels
he
could
sit.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
--
but
we're
here
on
the
question
of
constitutional
requirements,
and
the
constitution--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
what
you're
really
asking
is
whether
you
should
abandon
what
is
a
fairly
clearly
stated
rule
and
practice
of
the
--
of
this
court,
dating
back
to
the
common
law,
that
questions
of
bias
in
general
as
opposed
to
interest
are
matters
for
legislative
resolution
and
not
for
--
not
for
constitutional--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
don't
--
i
think,
first
of
all,
the
petitioner
has
not
advanced
on
the
merits
in
this
case
an
appearance
standard.
a
lot
of
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--all
right.
well,
if
you're
viewing
them
as
cinnamons
--
synonyms,
then
the
question
is
whether
that
kind
of
standard
is
a
--
is
the
constitutional
standard.
and
let
me
say
about
the
tumey
case
which
--
the
"possible
temptation"
language
in
the
tumey
case,
which
is
of
course
a
wide
open
standard:
that
was
discussed
only
after
the
court
said
questions
of
bias
are
not
constitutional,
they're
for
the
legislature;
questions
of
interest,
pecuniary
interest
in
the
tumey
case,
are.
and
then
the
language
that
mr.
olson
quoted
came
in
the
discussion
of
the
question
of
whether
the
pecuniary
interest
was
substantial
enough
to
create
a
disqualification,
constitutional
disqualification.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
it
seems
to
me
to
be
--
if
we're
talking
about
appearance
as
distinct
from
actual
bias
or
probable
--
you
know,
i
can
understand
a
rule
that
says
the
probability
of
bias
is
enough.
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
ill-advised
rule
without
historical
foundation,
without
foundation
in
the
court's
precedents,
and
open-ended
and
creating
all
kinds
of
problems,
but
i
can
understand
that
rule.
that
at
least
is
addressed
to
the
right
of
the
party
to
get
a
fair
trial.
appearance
is
addressed
to
a
different
thing.
it's
addressed
to
the
reputation
of
the
judicial
system,
which
is
not,
i
think,
the
function
of
the
due
process
clause
to
address.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
i
think
the
due
process
clause
is
concerned
with
the
fairness
of
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
i
think
it's
--
it
may
be
a
systemically
important
value.
but
i
think
as
long
as
the
judge
is
impartial
in
the
--
in
the
case
at
hand,
i
don't
think
there's
a
problem.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
--
i
think
this
is
a
side
point.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
think
so,
but
i
don't
think
it
--
i
don't
think
it
really
essentially
matters.
we're
--
we're
dealing
with
a
semantical
quibble
here,
where
the
real
question
is,
is
possibility
of
bias,
a
temptation
of
bias,
a
subconscious
effect
that
--
even
a
probability
of
bias,
whatever
--
there's
a
lot
of
different
standards
that
have
been
put
forward
--
is
that
a
constitutional
basis
for
disqualifying
a
judge
(a)?
(b)
if
it
is
sometimes
a
constitutional
basis
for
disqualifying
a
judge,
is
it
a
basis
under
the
debt
of
gratitude
theory?
and
(c)
if
the
debt
of
gratitude
theory
is
a
viable
theory
--
and
for
reasons
i
hope
to
have
a
minute
or
two
to
address,
i
think
it's
not
viable
--
does
it
apply
on
the
circumstances
of
this
case?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
raise
an
interesting
question
and
i
think
a
much
closer
question
than
this
case,
because
that
would
involve
the
question
of
whether
--
there
is
--
the
court
has
recognized
that
where
a
judge
is
embroiled
with
a
litigant
and
has
a
personal
animosity
arising
out
of
the
relationship
with
the
litigant,
that
is
--
that
is
a
possible
ground
for
recusal.
so
it's
a
--
it's
a
stronger
case.
i'm
not
sure
it's
strong
enough.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
no.
the
animosity
is
directed
at
massey
and
mr.
blankenship,
who
were--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
it's
a
closer
case.
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
it
would
have
been
violated
even
then.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
of
course.
i'd
be
happy
to.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
let
me
say
just
one
point
about
probability
of
bias,
which
is
conceptually
--
the
rule
is
quite
clear
at
common
law,
as
the
court
knows,
that
that
was
not
a
ground
for
disqualification
of
a
judge.
now--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
but--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
but
it
had--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that's
the
point
i
wanted
to
make,
that
while
--
while
common
law
did
not
have
elected
judges,
it
had
the
issue
of
bias.
after
all,
elected
judges
are
not
really
the
issue
here.
the
issue
is
not
whether
judges
should
be
elected;
the
issue
is
whether
--
whether
there
should
be
disqualification
for
bias.
that
is
an
issue
that
the
common
law
confronted.
this
is
not
like
some
novel
situation
that
has
arisen
that
the
common
law
didn't
deal
with.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
understand,
and
the
question
is
whether
that
--
that
gives
rise
to
bias.
so
let's
--
let's
turn
--
let's
turn
to
the
question
of
whether
the
debt
of
gratitude
theory,
which
i
take
it
is
the
principle
that
would
underlie
disqualification
in
the
election
context--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--debt
of
gratitude
i
think
is
a
principle.
you
have
to
ask
yourself
what
is
the
reason
why
somebody
would
conclude
--
why
a
court
would
conclude
that
justice
benjamin
is
--
is
not
biased.
and
let
me
say
that
one
of
the
key
elements
which
is
not
mentioned
by
the
other
side
which
is
very
important
is
the
presumption
of
impartiality.
it
goes
back
to
coke
and
blackstone.
judges
are
clothed
with
a
presumption
of
impartiality.
there
has
to
be
something
that
overcomes
that
presumption.
and
let
me
say
that
--
i
ask
the
court
to
ask
yourselves
if
you
were
in
justice
benjamin's
situation,
do
you
really
think
you
would
be
incapable
of
rendering
an
impartial
decision
in
a
case
involving
massey?
because
if
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
if
the
answer
to
that
is
you
would
not
be
incapable
of
rendering
an
unbiased
decision,
then
there
would
--
there's
no
justification
for
saying
that
justice
benjamin
would--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
it's
an
unworkable
standard,
and
--
and
i
ask
the
court
to
look
at--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
the
fourth
amendment
has
reasonableness
as
a
standard,
and
reasonableness
is
a--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--if
there
was
a
standard
that
said
judges
should
recuse
themselves
when
it
would
be
reasonable
to
suppose
that
there
was
bias,
if
the
constitution
said
that,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
or
we
would
be
here
arguing
about
whether--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i'm
not--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that.
what
i
am
sure
is
that
if
you
start
down
the
road
of
debt
of
gratitude,
which
i
think
is
the
animating
principle
if
there's
going
to
be
a
probability
of
bias--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
you
could--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--you
could
certainly
have
a
series
of
cases
in
which
you
would
--
which
you
would
decide
and
provide
standards.
i
think
that
could
be
done.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
in
the
constitution.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
sensible
standard,
and
as--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes.
that's
--
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i've
been
trying
to
get
to
it,
but
i
was
answering
justice
stevens's
question.
the
problem
with
debt
of
gratitude
is
that
it's
not
a
principle
with
any
reasonable
limit.
if
you
apply
it
here,
if
you
say
there's
a
debt
of
gratitude
here,
then
you
have
the
question
about
all
the
other
circumstances.
the
plaintiffs'
lawyers
gave
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
to
justice
mcgraw
to
support
his
reelection.
suppose
he
had
won?
what
--
what
do
you
do?
it's
true
that
no
one
individual
gave
a
lot
of
money,
but
it's
--
but
if
you're
looking
at
it
in
terms
of
what
is
the
probability
of
bias,
it's
at
least
as
great,
if
not
greater
than
here.
the
doctors
gave
$750,000
to
benjamin.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
you
have
a
--
you
have
to
have
a
logical
principle.
i'm
sorry,
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
don't
agree
with
you,
justice
breyer.
i
think
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
have
a
reason.
you
don't
have
a
decision
that's
good
for
this
case
only.
you
have
to
have
a
decision
that's
principled,
and
--
and
when
you
ask
what
is
the
principle,
what
is
it
that
would
cause
justice
benjamin
--
and
by
the
way,
let
me
say
that
i
think
if
justice
benjamin
was
moved
to
do
anything,
it's
to
vote
against
massey
or
to
recuse
himself
to
avoid
the
controversy
that
would
attend
a
vote
for
massey
that
he
knew
was
going
to
happen.
and
if
you
look
at
page
692
of
the
joint
appendix,
he
actually
discusses
that
problem.
so
i
don't
think
you
can
even
predict
which
way
these
circumstances
would
cause
him
to
go,
but
i
do
think
you
need
a
principle,
and
the
principle
is
either
debt
of
gratitude
or
hope
of
future
benefit.
as
to
the
hope
of
future
benefit
in
this
case,
that
is
totally
not
viable
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
one
is
justice
benjamin's
not
running
for
another
eight
years.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
a
long
time.
sure.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
you
wouldn't--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
--
well,
there's
several
problems
with
that,
justice
souter.
the
first
is
there's
no
more
likely
to
be
spent
on
justice
benjamin
than
on
any
other
member
of
the
court
who
might
be
sympathic,
and--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
a
lot
of
members
of
the
court
would
have
the
same
--
exactly
the
same
hopes,
and
with
more
reason:
they
might
be
running
sooner,
they
might
end
up
with
an
opponent
who
is
more
distasteful
to
mr.
blankenship.
and
by
the
way,
mr.
blankenship
is
not
massey.
they
are
two
separate
things--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
why
would
--
why
would
blankenship
be
more
likely
to
support
benjamin
than
to
support
justice
davis
or
justice--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--therefore--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--where
that
takes
you
is
that
all
the
judges
have
to
recuse
themselves
because
they
all
have
the
possibility
of
garnering
support.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
either
you
look
to
the
past
or
you
look
at
debt
of
gratitude,
and
in
our
brief
we
have
indicated
a
number
of
circumstances
where
the
same
debt
of
gratitude
rationale
would
apply.
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
led
to
benjamin's
election,
and
blankenship's
money
is
not
necessarily
the
main
thing
at
all.
and
if
you're
looking
forward--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--right,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
you
can't
--
if
you're
looking
at
--
at
where
--
where
would
the
bias
come
from,
and
i'm
assuming
now
that
some
probability
of
bias
standard
is
accepted
by
the
court,
and
i'm
asking
where
would
the
bias
come
from?
it
either
would
come
from
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
past
contributions
or
an
expectation
of
future
benefits.
if
it's
an
expectation
of
future
benefits,
it
is
not
reasonable
to
assume
that
benjamin
has
any
stronger
expectation
than
other
members
of
the
court.
so
it
seems
to
me
you're
in
a
position
where
if
he
has
to
recuse,
they
all
have
to
recuse.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
okay.
[laughter]
i
don't
know.
some
of
the
ground
is
covered
already
by
questions
during
mr.
olson's
argument.
i
think
the
debt
of
gratitude
cannot
be
limited
consistent
with
neutral
principles
to
large
individual
campaign
contributions.
you
have
newspaper
endorsements.
clearly,
you
could
have
a
debt
of
gratitude
there.
a
newspaper
could
be
a
party
in
the
case.
you
have
the
plaintiff
lawyers
and
the
doctors
which
we've
talked
about.
you
have
labor
unions
getting
out
the
vote.
you
have
political
figures
endorsing.
and
you
have
appointed
judges
and
--
and
to
say
that
there's
no
--
to
say
that
you're
going
to
carve
out
the
gratitude
that
the
judges
feel
toward
the
president
who
appointed
them
--
i
mean,
the
fact
is
in
the
nixon
tapes
case,
and
in
clinton
against
jones--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
you're
mixing
up
two
different
things.
what
is
the
--
one
question
is
what
is
the
wellspring
of
the
bias?
where
--
why
do
we
think
the
judge
has
bias?
and
the
second
question
is
how
do
we
measure
that?
and
what
i'm
saying
is
if
you
think
that
justice
benjamin
would
be
biased
in
this
case
--
which
i
certainly
don't,
and
i
think
his
track
record
has
shown
no
bias
in
favor
of
massey
--
then
why
would
--
why
would
an
appointed
justice,
appointed
by
a
president
in
a
case
where
the
president's
personal
interests
are
at
stake
not
have
the
same
feelings
of
bias?
and
yet
justices
sit
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you.
