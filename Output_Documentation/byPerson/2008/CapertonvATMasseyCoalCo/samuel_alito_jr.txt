well,
they
propose
a
seven-factor
test,
and
all
of
the
other
amici,
who
know
a
lot
about
this
subject,
propose
multifactor
tests.
public
citizen
has
ten
factors,
the
aba
has
four
factors.
in
an
effort
to
see
if
this
can
be
put
in
more
concrete
terms,
i
wonder
if
you
would
be
willing
to
say
categorically
that
your
--
the
holding
that
you're
proposing
would
not
apply
under
any
of
these
situations:
where
the
judges
are
appointed,
where
there
are
massive
contributions
and
a
hotly
contested
election,
but
the
issue
is
not
an
economic
issue,
it's
a
social
issue;
where
there
isn't
any
specific
issue
headed
for
the
court
but
there
are
massive
contributions
by,
let's
say,
the
plaintiffs'
bar
and
the
defense
bar?
could
you
say
categorically
in
any
of
those
situations
that
your
rule
would
not
apply?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
difference
between
this
situation
and
a
situation
where
a
justice
or
a
judge
is
appointed
by
an
executive
and
then
hears
a
case
that
is
of
critical
importance
to
the
executive?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
justice
benjamin
were
term-limited,
would
this
case
be
different?
