justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
frey,
is
it
your
position
that
the
appearance
of
impropriety
could
never
be
strong
enough
to
raise
a
constitutional
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
assuming
appearances
only.
are
you
saying
that
appearances
without
any
actual
proof
of
bias
could
never
be
sufficient
as
a
constitutional
matter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
an
answer
to
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing,
for
example,
the
judge
had
campaigned
on
the
ground
that
he
would
issue
favorable
rulings
to
the
united
mine
workers,
and
the
united
mine
workers
campaigned,
raising
money
saying,
we
want
to
get
a
judge
who
will
rule
in
our
favor
in
all
the
cases
we're
interested
in.
would
that
create
an
appearance
of
impropriety?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
take
another
example.
the
chief
justice
asked
what
if
there
are
ten
members
of
a
trade
association
and
would
all
--
and
they
all
contributed
to
get
a
judge
to
vote
in
their
favor
in
a
case
that
involved
a
conspiracy
charge
among
the
--
charged
the
ten
of
them
for
violations
of
the
sherman
act,
something
like
that.
and
if
all
ten
of
them
raise
money
publicly
for
the
very
purpose
of
getting
a
judge
who
would
rule
favorably
in
their
favor,
that
would
clearly
create
a
very
extreme
appearance
of
impropriety.
would
that
be
sufficient,
in
your
judgment,
to
raise
a
constitutional
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
would
meet
the
test
in
the
--
in
the
judges'
brief
of
an
average
judge
would
be
tempted
under
the
circumstances.
that's
the
test
that
the
conference
of
chief
judges--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
do
you
think
that
could
ever,
just
appearance,
could
ever
raise
a
due
process
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
matter
how
extreme
the
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
whole
point
of
this
case
is
it
has
not
been
recognized
--
we
have
never
confronted
a
case
as
extreme
as
this
before.
this
fits
the
standard
that
potter
stewart
articulated
when
he
said
"i
know
it
when
i
see
it.
"
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
not
whether
we
have,
but
whether
we
should.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
you
can
stop
at
what's
obviously
improper.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
the
community's
confidence
in
the
way
judges
behave
is
an
important
part
of
due
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
whether
your
challenge
to
the
probability
of
bias
as
a
standard
--
do
you
think
it's
an
unworkable
standard
or
that
even
if
there
is
a
probability
of
bias,
that
should
not
be
constitutionally
disqualifying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
any
more
unworkable
than
probable
cause
in
a
fourth
amendment
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
has
probable
cause
as
a
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
get
back
to
the
question.
why
is
probability
in
this
context
any
more
difficult
to
figure
out
than
probability
in
the
fourth
amendment
context?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
asking
you
about
debt
of
gratitude.
i'm
asking
you
why
isn't
the
probability
standard
perfectly
administerable,
just
as
it
is
in
the
fourth
amendment?
and
surely
you
would
agree--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
if
there
is
a
probability
of
bias,
he
ought
to
get
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey,
there
is
obviously
a
difference
between
appointed
judges
and
elected
judges.
but
why
do
we
have
to
rest
on
just
one
factor?
the
conference
of
chief
justices
suggested
their
seven
factors
should
be
taken
into
account.
why
is
that
totally
unworkable?
why
does
it
have
to
be
just
one
theory,
debt
of
gratitude
and
nothing
else?
they
don't
--
the
chief
judges
who
are
elected
don't
think
that's
the
way
to
do
it.
