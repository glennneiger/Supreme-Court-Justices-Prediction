mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
fair
trial
in
a
fair
tribunal
is
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
that
means
not
only
the
absence
of
actual
bias,
but
a
guarantee
against
even
the
probability
of
an
unfair
tribunal.
in
short--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--you
have
said
that
in
the
murchison
case
and
in
a
number
of
other
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
the
language
of
the
murchison
case
specifically
says
so.
the
court
said
in
that
case:
"a
fair
trial
in
a
fair
tribunal
is
a
basic
requirement
of
due
process.
"
"fairness,
of
course,
requires
an
absence
of
actual
bias
in
the
trial
of
cases,
but
our
system
of
law
has
always
endeavored
to
prevent
even
the
probability
of
unfairness.
"
and
in
that
paragraph,
the
court
goes
on--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--pardon?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
but
that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
the
court
has
said
that
frequently,
not
only
the
probability
of
bias,
the
appearance
of
bias,
the
likelihood
of
bias,
the
inherent
suspicion
of
bias.
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
in
a
context
--
a
series
of
contexts
or
cases.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
probable
cause,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
frequently
decides
questions
involving
due
process,
equal
protection,
probable
cause,
speedy
trial,
on
the
basis
not
of
mathematical
certainty,
but
in
this
case
where
an
objective
observer
would
come
to
the
conclusion
--
knowing
all
of
the
facts,
would
come
to
the
conclusion
that
a
judge
or
jurist
would
probably
be
biased
against
that
individual
or
in
favor
of
his
opponent,
that
would
be
sufficient
under
the
due
process
clause,
we
submit.
the
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
court
--
the
court,
justice
ginsburg,
has
used
the
changes
interchangeably.
we
think
the
"probably
probable"
standard
is
the
one
we
would
advance
to
this
court.
but
the
--
but
the
seminal
case,
the
tumey
case,
said
that
even
if
there
was
a
possibility
--
any
procedure
where
there
would
be
"a
possible
temptation
for
the
judge
not
to
hold
the
balance
nice,
clear,
and
true.
"
would
be
the
standard.
but
--
and
the
aetna
--
in
the
aetna
v.
lavoie
case
not
very
many
years
ago,
the
court
repeated
that
standard,
and
that
standard
has
been
repeated
again
and
again.
the
likelihood
or
the
possibility
or
even
the
temptation--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
justice
scalia:
if
--
an
ordinary
person
would
say
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
judge
to
hold
the
balance
nice,
square,
and
true
when
that
judge
has
just
been
put
on
the
bench
during
the
pendency
of
the
trial
of
the
case
by
his
opponent's
contribution
of
$3
million
to
his
election.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
would
go
back
to
the
words
of
this
court
in
the
tumey
case,
the
seminal
case.
"due
process.
"
"is
not
satisfied
by
the
argument
that
men
of
the
highest
honor
and
greatest
self-sacrifice
could
carry
it
out
without
danger
of
injustice.
"
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it's
not
clear.
there
is
a--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we're
not
claiming
that
there
is
a
basis
based
upon
personal
relationship,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
if
i
can
address
part
of
the
premise
of
your
question
and
invite
the
court
to
look
at
page
188a
of
the
joint
appendix.
this
addresses
the
point
that
you
just
made
that
he
was
contributing
his
money
to
defeat
justice
mcgraw
as
opposed
to
supporting
justice
benjamin.
on
page
188a
is
one
of
those
financial
disclosure
reports
that's
required
by
west
virginia
law.
it's
filed
by
mr.
blankenship,
and
it
says
on
that
page:
"expenditures
made
to
support
or
oppose.
"
and
he
underlines
the
word
"support",
and
then
he
types
in
the
word
"brent
benjamin".
then
if
you'll
turn
over
to
page
200a,
which
is
the
last
page
of
that
report,
that
shows
that
he
directly
spent
$508,000
of
his
own
money
to
support
justice
benjamin.
now,
to
the
larger
part
of
your
point,
the
context
of
this
case
suggests
that,
while
the
appeal
was
going
to
be
coming
to
the
--
to
the
west
virginia
supreme
court,
mr.
blankenship,
who
was
the
ceo,
chairman,
major
stockholder,
and
a
--
the
prime
mover
in
the
case
that
gave
rise
to
liability
in
this
case,
decided
to
unseat
justice
mcgraw,
who
he
thought
would
be
unfavorable
to
him,
and
elect
justice
benjamin,
who
he
thought
would
be
favorable
to
him.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
answer
probably
is
not,
chief
justice
roberts,
but
--
but
this
is
--
like
your
cases
involving
reasonable
search
and
seizure,
it's
going
to
require
an
analysis
of
the
complex
of
circumstances.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
the
court
would
--
a
reasonable
objective
observer
knowing
all
of
the
facts
would
not
feel
that
that
--
that
trade
group
was
not
a
party
to
the
case,
who
is
not
personally
involved
in
having
a
personal
stake
in
the
election
or
the
outcome
of
that
particular
case,
but
may
be
interested
in
a
panoply
of
cases
or
judges
that
approach
things
in
a
certain
way;
that
would
not
give
rise
to
what
you're
concerned
about
here.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if
those
are
the
companies
that
are
a
party
to
the
case,
if
it's
when
their
case
is
pending,
if
it's
a
vast
magnitude
--
the
magnitude--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
i
think
that
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
no.
i
think
that
that
is
--
i
answered
your
question
whether
it's
only
those
cases.
that
is
a
part
of
the
circumstances
that
would
give
rise
--
you
have
decided,
this
court
has
decided
that
the
possibility
that
a
$12
benefit,
the
tumey
case,
might
ultimately
come
to
the
judge
is
a
disqualifying
interest.
you've
decided
in
the
monroeville
case
that
because
the
adjudicator
was
the
mayor
of
a
town
who
might
receive
some
fines--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
would
submit
that
your
cases
say
that
when
a
judge
has
an
interest
in
the
case
and
that
interest
leads
to
the
likelihood
of--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
let
me
--
let
me
answer
that
in
--
there's
more
parts,
there's
more
than
one
part
to
that
question.
let
me
answer
the
first
part
first.
the
court
hasn't
said
that
there
are
only
two
categories
of
disqualifying
bias.
i
submit
the
court
has
said
that
it's
interest
in
the
outcome.
that
interest
in
the
outcome
might
be
financial--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
respectfully--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
respectfully
submit,
justice
scalia,
that
in
the
monroeville
case
the
judge
didn't
have
a
personal
financial
interest.
he
had
what
the
court
called
a
"partisan"
interest
because
the
money
that
might
have
been
assessed
in
the
way
of
fines
might
have
come
to
the
city.
in
the
lavoie
case,
the
judge
didn't
have
a
direct
financial
interest.
he
had
an
indirect
potential
financial
interest.
in
the
johnson
v.
mississippi
case,
the
judge
had
been
named
in
an
institutional
suit
about
racial
bias
and
whether
juries
should
be
--
those
--
there's
a
panoply
of
circumstances,
all
of
which
add
up,
justice
scalia,
i
submit,
to
a
situation
where
a
judge
is
--
where
a
reasonable
person
would
suspect
that
the
judge
would
have
a
hard
time,
in
the
words
of
this
court,
"holding
the
balance
nice,
clear,
and
true.
"
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
i
was
going
to--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--in
the
first
place,
there's
a
--
there
is
a
significant
difference
with
respect
to
the
framers
of
the
constitution
who
gave
the
members
of
this
court
and
the
federal
judiciary
life
tenure
for
the
very
purpose
of
ensuring
the
independence
of
the
judiciary.
there
is
a
separate
consideration
that
this
court
has
mentioned
because
of
the
--
the
fact
that
judges
and
justices
of
this
court
cannot
be
replaced
if
they
feel
that
they
must
recuse
themselves.
there's
--
there's
a
--
another
interest
is
institutionally
presidents
appointing
justices
all
of
the
time
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
but
not
to
attempt
to
affect
the
outcome
in
their
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
chief
justice
roberts.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
of
course,
there
are
factors
and
circumstances,
but
the
--
when
--
when
an
individual
or
a
group
of
individuals
makes
contributions
in
the
context
of
elections
--
and
we
are
going
to
have
state
elections
of
--
of
judges.
we
have
them
in
40
--
39
states,
and
there's
no
sign
that
those
are
going
to
be
discontinued
any
time
soon.
but
when
a
group
of
individuals
or
an
individual
is
--
is
making
contributions
because
they
think
the
jurist
is
going
to
be
sensitive
to
--
to
the
rights
of
criminals
or
sensitive
to
the
rights
of
victims
of
criminals,
those
are
generic
concerns
that
people
participating
in
the
electoral
process--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
can't
--
i
can't
rule
out
a
situation
where
there
is
a
potential
litigant
who
has
a
stake
in
front
of
a
case.
the
amounts
here
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration,
too.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
would
be--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there
are
several
answers
to
that.
in
the
first
place,
the
conference
of
chief
justices
of
all
of
the
states
of
the
united
states
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
and
said
that
we
need
a
standard
with
respect
to
recusals
for
extraordinary
campaign
contributions
in
cases.
they
also
said
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
because,
justice
scalia,
the
--
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
in
connection
with
standards
like
due
process
or
probable
cause
or
speedy
trial
or
equal
protection
can't
be
nailed
down
with
levels
of
specificity.
it
would
be
very
inviting--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
--
i
--
the
reason
we
--
we
approached
it
from
that
standpoint,
justice
kennedy,
is
the
probability
of
bias
is
something
that
this
court
has
said
repeatedly.
but
let
me
answer
your
question
this
way:
when
the
circumstances,
including
the
timing
of
the
contribution,
the
magnitude
and
proportion
of
the
contribution
are
such
that
it
would
lead
a
reasonable
person
in
possession
of
all
of
the
facts
--
these
are
all
words
from
these
courts'
decisions
--
to
believe
that
the
judge
would
have
a
difficult
time
being
other
than
biased
in
favor
of
one
of
the
parties,
that
would
be
the
standard
that
would
be
applied.
it's
a
general
standard,
but--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
conference
of
chief
justices--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
is
very
much
central,
but
it's
not
exclusively
central.
if
the
--
and
--
and
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
on
pages
63
through
65a
of
the
joint
appendix,
for
example,
are
the
specific
post-trial
motion
findings
of
the
judge
saying
that
the
prime
mover
in
the
--
in
the
conduct
that
was
declared
to
be
fraudulent
and
a
deliberate
effort
to
drive
this
company
out
of
business
was
mr.
blankenship.
so
factually
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
is
a
central
factor.
if
he
had
given
one
dollar,
we--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
submit,
justice
scalia,
you're
going
to
have
to
wipe
out
a
lot
of
jurisprudence
from
this
court
that
uses
terms
like
"appearance
of
bias",
"likelihood
of
bias".
your
--
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
--
i
would
be
delighted
to
say
that
the
standard
was
50
percent
of
the
contributions
in
an
election,
and
we
would
come
along
in
a
case
where
there
would
be
a
very
small
amount
of
money,
and
someone
--
that
--
that
all
of
those
situations
are
distinguishable.
i
admit
this
is
not
easy,
but
the
conference
of
chief
justices
specifically
said,
to
get
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
what
did
they
propose
and
are
they
proposing
something
comparable
to
us?
they
are
--
they
are
--
and
this
is
on
page
4
of
the
conference
of
chief
justices'
brief.
they
are
the
judges
who
would
have
to
live
with
this
decision.
they
said:
(a)
we
need
it.
"extraordinarily
out-of-line
campaign
support
from
a
source
that
has
a
substantial
stake.
"
in
the
outcome
of
the
proceedings
where
those
"extreme
facts
create
a
"probability
of
actual
bias".
"
and
then
they
go
on
to
say,
to
answer
the
floodgate
problem
that
my
opponent
raises
--
this
is
going
to
open
the
floodgates,
and
you
will
have
nothing
but
recusal
motions.
they
explicitly
state
that
concern
is
not
--
is
"unfounded".
"no
bright-line
rule
can
or
should
be
attempted.
"
these
are
the
judges
who--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
states
are
perfectly
free
to
do
that.
but
let
me--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--let
me
make
this
point,
justice
scalia.
the
contribution
limit
in
west
virginia
is
$1,000.
mr.
blankenship
contributed
$1,000,
and
then
he
put
up
three
million
additional
dollars,
3,000--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
--
i
think
that
this
court's
--
this
court's
campaign
finance
jurisprudence
acknowledges
the
appropriateness
of
campaign
contribution
limits,
the
very
point
that
justice
scalia
just
made,
and
other
limits.
and
in
--
and,
in
fact,
states
have
limits
against
corporate
contributions,
limits
against
union
contributions.
i
think
the
united
mine
workers
incident
came
up.
but--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
the
--
and
--
and
the
states
do
have
limitations
with
respect
to
what
litigants
can
do,
but--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
there
are
--
there
are
more
than
one
answer
to
that
question.
one,
the
political
process
to
which
you
refer
is
spiraling
out
of
control.
there
is
a
financial
arms
race
in
judicial
elections
in
various
states
throughout
the
country,
and
the
briefs--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
--
it
hasn't
done
the
job
so
far,
and
the
trend
seems
to
be
in
the
opposite
direction,
but
even
if
it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
--
i
believe
that
is
correct,
but
i
don't
think
that
would
have
addressed
the
problem
in
this
case
because--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--irrespective
of
that,
i
was
going
to
go
on
and
answer
this
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question.
the
conference
of
chief
justices,
i
think,
provide
a
second
answer
to
that
question.
they
are
the
ones
where
the
rubber
meets
the
road,
so
to
speak.
they
are
saying,
and
the
entire
conference
is
saying,
we
need
some
guidance
here
with
respect
to
a
constitutional
limit--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
would
hesitate
--
i
would
hesitate
to
do
so,
justice
alito.
i
think
you've
put
your
finger
on
some
of
the
circumstances
that
would
take
it
out
of
the
context
of
the
appearance
of
justice
for
sale.
i'm
going
to
reserve,
if
i
may,
the
balance
of
my
time,
but
finish
with
a
reference.
the
principle
that
we're
articulating
here
is
not
new
to
the
jurisprudence
of
the
western
world
and
the
legal
jurisprudence
that
we
come
from.
in
the
magna
carta,
the
king
promised:
"to
no
one
will
we
sell
justice.
"
and
blackstone
repeated
that
and
restated
it
and
stated:
"for
injury
done
to
every
subject,
he
may
take
his
remedy
by
the
course
of
law
and
have
justice
freely
without
sale.
"
this
circumstance
in
this
case
involves
the
appearance
of
judges
being
bought.
now,
we're
not
saying
that
there's
actual
bias
because
there's
actual
--
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
that's
impossible
to
prove,
and
that's
why
the
appearance
of
probability
of
bias
is
so
important
to
the
respect
that
we
need
to
have
for
the
judicial
system.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
scalia,
you
mentioned
that
the
words
"reasonable
search
and
seizure"
are
in
the
constitution.
the
words
"due
process"
are
in
the
constitution,
and
that
is
what
we're
talking
about
today.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
--
and
i
don't
think
my
opponent
objects
or
disagrees
--
that
due
process
means
a
fair
trial
in
a
fair
tribunal.
so
what
are
we
talking
about
today?
what
is
a
fair
tribunal?
he
said
ask
yourself,
could
you
be
fair
if
you
were
in
justice
benjamin's
position?
that,
i
submit,
is
not
the
question,
because
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
actual
bias
is
something
that's
virtually
impossible
to
prove,
the
council
of
--
the
conference
of
chief
justices
said
don't
go
there.
we
can't
ever
determine
that.
and
so
the
question
is
what
is
--
is
someone
likely
to
be
biased,
likely
to
be
unfair?
and,
justice
kennedy,
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
factors
that
led
us
to
the
conclusion
that
an
objective
standard,
that
a
reasonable
person
knowing
all
of
the
facts
would
probably
be
biased
is
language
from
a
number
of
these
court
--
this
court's
decisions,
including
your
concurrence
in
the
liteky
case
--
i
think
it's
liteky,
l-i-t-e-k-y
--
in
which
you
said
the
objective
observer
would
entertain
reasonable
questions
about
the
judge's
impartiality.
now,
that's
a
case
involving
section
455
and
not
the
due
process
clause,
but
i
think
the
logic
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
test
and
the
ability
of
this
court
and
other
courts
to
apply
it,
as
the
conference
of
chief
justices
said
they
could,
is
the
same.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
--
the
--
there's
a
number
of
questions.
in
the
first
place,
there's
life
tenure
for
federal
judges.
secondly,
was
that
appointment
made
specifically--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
i
think
it
wouldn't
be
different
because
of
all
of
the
confluence
of
circumstances.
if
a
detached
observer,
again
to
use
justice
kennedy's
words--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--he
might
be
running
for
another
court.
he
might
be
--
he
might
need
the
benefits.
this
was
$3
million
in
a
race
in
which
that
amounted
to
more
money
than
everybody
else
collectively
put
into
this
race
while
this
case
was
pending.
now,
the
language
that
i
think
is
important
is
from
the
tumey
case:
"might
not
a
defendant
with
reason
say
that
he
feared
he
would
not
get
a
fair
trial?
"
so
instead
of
the
question
that
my
opponent
asks,
would
you
be
fair,
which
is
not
the
standard
because
actual
bias
isn't
the
test,
would
there
be
a
perception,
likelihood,
probability,
appearance
of
bias,
to
use
the
language
used
by
this
court
over
and
over
again?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
ask
yourself
this
question--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--as
this
court
has
said,
i
think,
in
one
of
the
cases
that
you
can't
allow
a
litigant
to
try
to
game
the
system
in
that
way.
but
what
i
was
getting
to
instead
of
the
question--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
not
going
to
be
clear
in
every
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
going
to
be
would
a
detached
observer
conclude
that
a
fair
and
impartial
hearing
would
be
possible?
so
instead
of
the
question
that
mr.
frey
was
asking,
whether
you,
yourself,
could
be
--
i'd
like
to
ask
you
to
ask
this
question:
if
this
was
going
to
be
the
judge
in
your
case,
would
you
think
it
would
be
fair
and
would
it
be
a
fair
tribunal
if
the
judge
in
your
case
was
selected
with
a
$3
million
subsidy
by
your
opponent?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
is
the
standard
that
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
then
if
it
was
a
basis
for
a
recusal,
you
would
have
to
be
recusing
all
the
time,
because
that
is
a
standard
that's
--
reasonable
question
of
impartiality
is
in
section
455,
it
is
in
many
of
the
state
codes.
the
courts
handle
these
decisions
all
of
the
time.
these
are
factors
--
and
i
think
i'd
go
back
to
justice
stevens's
and
justice
breyer's
question.
this
is
a
situation
where
there
has
got
to
be
some
limits.
our
opponents
say
there's
--
biased
tribunals
are
not
prohibited
by
the
due
process
clause
nor
probably
biased
or
the
appearance
of
bias.
we
think
there
has
to
be
some
constitutional
limit.
