mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
estoppel
is
what
you
invoke
when
you
have
no
contract
to
invoke,
and
this
version
of
equitable
estoppel
is
what
you
invoke
when
you
have
no
arbitration
agreement
to
invoke.
i
want
to
come
to
a
question
that
was
just
asked
by
--
by
justice
breyer.
section
3
mandates
only
stays
in
aid
of
contract-based
arbitration
obligations.
they
are
not
fungible,
these
arbitration
agreements.
they
cannot
just
be
picked
up
by
anyone
and
advanced
as
a
ground
for
arbitration.
this
court
has
consistently
said,
in
volt,
for
example,
at
page
478:
the
faa
does
not
require
parties
to
arbitrate.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
because
the
stay
that
he
requested
was
distinctly
outside
section
3,
not
as
a
merits
question,
but
so
far
outside
question
--
section
3
that
we
can
say
he
should
not
--
that
the
stay
was
not
requested
under
section
3;
it
was
not
denied
under
section--
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
--right.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
yes.
there
are--
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
--right.
there
are
sort
of
what
i
would
call
the
trojan
horse
appeals,
where
a
party
actually
has
moved
to
compel
discovery
and
they
characterized
it
as
an
injunction.
when
that
was
denied,
they
said:
an
injunction
was
denied;
we
have
the
right
under
1292(a).
the
court
of
appeals
is
perfectly
able
to
pierce
that
and
say:
no,
that's
a
discovery
motion;
that's
outside
of
the
injunctive
area.
and
here
why
we're
saying
this,
your
honor
--
and
we
recognize
what
they
say
about
the
behrens
case
--
this
is
an
instance
where
we're
asking
the
court
to,
in
a
sense,
pull
the
veil
on
these
section
3--
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
--right.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
right.
and
there's
a
reason
why
those
--
in
those
cases,
the
third
--
i
will
call
them
nonparties
were
allowed
to
enforce.
let
me
preface
that
by
saying
not
all
of
those
were
--
we've
heard
a
lot
about
state
law
and
federal
law.
not
all
of
those
are
tightly
grounded
in
federal
law.
but
take
your
example
of
the
third-party
beneficiary,
they
cite
a
case
called
j.p.
morgan
in
which
the
woman
was
incompetent,
the
agreement
with
the
nursing
home
was
signed
as
--
on
her
behalf.
i
think
that's
clear
in
that
kind
of
case
that
the
nonparty
is
--
is
asserting
the
right
through
the
contract,
because
of
the
contract,
dependent
on
the
contract.
here,
by
--
by
claiming
equitable
estoppel
not
only
aren't
the
petitioners
asserting
rights
that
flow
to
them
from
the
contract,
because
they
have
no
contract;
they
are
actually
saying
--
this
is
the
gist,
it
gets
back
to
your
question,
what's
the
gist
of
their
equitable
estoppel
theory?
it's
as
we
quote
in
footnote
13:
the
gist
of
it
is
that
equitable
principles
prevent
respondents
from
claiming
that
they
have
no
obligation
to
arbitrate
with
the
petitioners
despite
the
lack
of
an
agreement.
their
very
theory
assumes
that
what
section
3
says
must
exist
is
absent.
their
very
theory
says
we
don't
have
an
agreement
of
our
own
to
assert,
and
therefore,
we
need
equitable
principles
to
fill
the
void.
now,
where
do
these
equitable
principles
come
from?
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
your
honor,
the
--
the
fact
that
they
have
filed
a
motion,
and
as
i
referred
to
it,
the
concern
that
we
have
--
and
i
think
the
concern
that
animated
dsmc
and
universal
when
they
took
up
this
issue
--
was
the
trojan
horse
stay
motion.
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
not
every
stay
that
is
filed
pending
arbitration,
a
stay
pending
arbitration,
is
necessarily
filed
under
section
3,
because
in
footnote
23
of
moses
h.
cone
this
court
recognized
another
kind
of
stay
pending
arbitration,
and
that's
a
discretionary
stay.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
the
criterion,
your
honor,
is
that
the
--
that
the
right
to
the
stay
must
be
--
the
right
to
--
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
referable
to
arbitration
under
an
agreement.
what
does
that
mean?
"referable
to
arbitration"
is
the
arbitration
obligation.
"under"
in
that
means
dependent
on,
because
of.
so
the
arbitrability
of
it
depends
on
a
written
agreement.
that's
what
section
3--
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
--yes.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
just
to
clarify,
the
statute
being
section
3?
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
yes.
the
reason
for
that
is
this
court
has
been
very
clear
in
its
interpretations
of
the
faa
in
general.
the
faa
in
general,
the
court
has
said,
requires
--
does
not
require
parties
to
arbitrate
when
they
have
not
agreed
to
do
so.
so
that
sets
the
standard.
if
there
is
no
agreement,
you
cannot
force
that
signatory,
which
didn't
have
an
agreement
with
that
non-signatory,
to
arbitrate.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
all
of
those
examples,
justice
kennedy
--
in
all
of
those
examples
the
right
to
enforce
the
agreement,
let's
say
the
right
to
procure
a
stay
based
on
the
agreement,
flows
from
the
intention
of
the
parties
to
the
original
agreement.
the
examples
they
use
--
assignment,
they
cite
a
case
where
there
is
--
there
was
an
express
assignment,
and
in
the
assignment
the
court
said
they
actually
assigned
the
agreement
with
the
arbitration
clause
in
it
to
the
successor.
they
cite
an
assumption
case.
it
was
an
express
signed
assumption.
those
are
all
cases
of
contract-based
arbitration.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
well,
let
me
tease
that
out
a
bit.
the
--
one
of
the
--
the
problems
in
this
area,
this
equitable
estoppel
that
has
developed
as
an
ersatz
form
of
equity
principle,
it
is
not
tied
to
section
3,
nor
is
it
tied
to
state
law.
it
is
--
it
is
perfectly
ad
hoc,
so
it's
an
amorphous
concept
that
we've
seen
develop
over
the
last
30
years.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
right.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
right.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
justice
breyer,
the
question
of
arbitrability
does
not
always
depend
on
state
law.
in
volt,
in
first
options,
this
court
said
sometimes
it
does,
but
it
does
when
the
issue
is
--
was
a
contract
formed?
is
a
contract
valid?
how
are
we
going
to
interpret
that
contract?
here
where
equitable
estoppel
is
concerned,
that's
not
the
consideration.
therefore,
because
you
can
--
you
can
interpret
the
contract
until
the
cows
come
home,
you're
never
going
to
find
the
petitioners
in
it.
so
that
the
question--
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
--right.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
i
think
the
safest
ground
is
to
clear
up
first
this
question
of
how
arbitrability
is
decided.
and
i
think
justice
alito
asked
the
question:
is
--
is
there
unanimity
among
the
courts
of
appeals?
the
fourth
circuit
case
that
i
--
i
think
was
mentioned
--
i
believe
that's
the
bailey
case.
i
don't
even
think
there's
unanimity,
unfortunately,
within
the
fifth
circuit.
but
there
--
there
--
the
better
view,
i
think,
that
is
expressed
in
the
fourth
circuit
case
is
that
when
the
issue
that's
pivotal
is
contract
interpretation,
arbitrability
in
that
narrow
sense,
that's
state
law.
when
it's
not,
it's
federal
law.
and
i
think
that's
why
you
see
these
equitable
estoppel
cases
not
talking
at
all
about
state
law.
it
is
sort
of
an
ersatz,
ad
hoc
version
of
federal
equity
that's
being--
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
--i
think
that
it's
the
correct
approach
to
say
that
we
are
not
talking
generically
about
the
enforceability
of
arbitration
agreements.
we
are
talking
in
the
context,
under
section
3,
of
an
existing
lawsuit.
that
one
party
says,
hey,
i
want
to
stay
this
lawsuit.
so
it
is
a
different
enforcement
mechanism
than
--
than
the
--
than
the
generic
law.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
it
does.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
it's
a
good
theory
because
then,
once
you've
opened
that
door
to
the
--
the
ability
to
ask
for
a
stay,
you
must
ask:
well,
what
are
the
ground
rules
for
asking
for
this
stay?
and
while
my
friend
continuously
returns
to
state
law,
our
point
is
you
don't
depart
from
the
terms
of
section
3
itself,
because
section
3
itself
tells
you
the
circumstances
under
which
the
mandatory
stay
provision
applies.
and
those
circumstances
are
only
when
it
is
referable
to
arbitration
under
a
written
agreement.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
well,
that's
consistent
with
the
federal
policy
as
this
court
has
expressed
that
federal
policy.
it
has
--
it
has
said
repeatedly
the
federal
policy
is
not
a
general
policy
to
encourage
this
form
of
dispute
resolution
but,
rather,
it
is
to
give
effect
to
parties
when
and
if
they
agree
to
arbitration.
so
i
agree
that
that
is,
and
should
be,
the
starting
point
of
the
analysis.
is
--
and
--
and
it
was
expressed
in
--
in
mitsubishi
this
way:
that
--
that
the
intent
of
the
faa
is
to
give
effect
to
arbitration
agreements,
to
put
them
on
equal
footing
with
all
other
agreements,
but
not
more
so.
and
i
believe
what
--
what
petitioners
are
asking
for
is
the
"more
so".
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
with
my
friend's
reading?
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
justice
stevens,
i
have
to
be
honest
and
say
i'm
concerned
about
that
argument
because
i
think
congress
has
used
the
word
faa
rather
haphazardly
to
mean
three
different
things,
maybe
four:
party
to
the
agreement,
party
to
the
action,
party
to
the
arbitration,
or
party-like
person.
and
i
would
be
concerned
about
hanging
it
on
--
on
that.
so
my
--
my
answer
is,
because
of
the
way
it's
used
in
sections
3,
4,
5,
9,
i'd
be
concerned
about
--
about
resting
on
that.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
i
--
actually
in
section
3,
what
i
would
say
is
it's
equivocal,
and
the
rest
of
the
faa
doesn't
help
us
understand
that.
so
it's
an
--
it's
an
issue
on
which
i
would
not
hang
my
hat,
because
it
is
equivocal.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
right.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
right.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
right.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
i
think
it's
--
it's
correct.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
yes.
the
only
way,
i
think,
to
give
effect
to
what
the
court
has
said,
which
is
nobody
is
going
to
be
forced
to
arbitrate
when
they
haven't
agreed
to
arbitrate,
is
for
judges
to
take
section
3
seriously
when
it
is
proffered
as
the
basis
for
a
stay
motion
and
to
--
and
to
apply
it
as
it
is
written.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
justice
ginsburg,
by
declining
justice
stevens's
invitation
of
sorts
to
read
"parties"
a
particular
way,
i
did
not
mean
to
--
to
suggest
that
the
referable
--
issue
referable
to
arbitration
under
a
written
agreement
is
ambiguous.
i
don't
think
that's
ambiguous.
i
think
as
applied
here
in
this
case,
it's
clear
that
the
--
the
petitioners'
claim
of
arbitrability
does
not
flow,
to
use
justice
breyer's
terms,
from
that
which
the
parties
to
the
bricolage
agreement
intended.
they
don't
claim
that
the
parties
to
that
agreement
intended
for
them
to
be
covered,
as
would
be
the
case
with
a
third-party
beneficiary
or--
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
--if
it
were
limited
to
parties
to
the
--
if
it
were
interpreted
as
parties
to
the
arbitration
agreement,
then
it
would
suggest
that
a
party
outside
the
litigation
--
let's
say
a
party
that's
conducting
an
arbitration
pursuant
to
an
arbitration
agreement
--
could
intervene.
that's
what
happened
in
dsmc.
the
--
the
--
one
of
the
contracting
parties
intervened
and
said,
we
are
engaged
in
this
arbitration.
we
want
you
to
stop
this,
what
had
been
claimed
to
be,
nonarbitrable
litigation.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
pardon
me?
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
that's
true.
yes.
i
think
it
was
--
there
it
was
an
intervention
for
the
limited
purpose
of
seeking
a
stay.
i
--
i
take
your
point,
though,
that
--
i
--
i
think
we
have
to
be
careful
in
--
in
judging
the
--
a
stay
motion,
to
focus
on
the
language
of
section
3
under
the
"under
a
written
agreement"
language,
and
when
--
when
that
is
the
focus,
i
think
it's
clear
that
theories
such
as
equitable
estoppel,
an
outlier
among
all
those
theories
that
were
listed
--
assumption,
assignment
--
an
outlier
among
them
--
uniquely
says,
despite
the
lack
of
a
written
agreement
to
arbitrate,
equity
requires;
equity
says
it
should
be
arbitrated.
that
--
that
i
think
is
incompatible
with
the
language
of
section
3.
after
all--
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
--right.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
there
is
an
appellate
pathway
and
that
is
1292(b).
that
has
always
existed
for
discretionary
stays.
i
think
it
applies
when
a
party
attempts,
perhaps
labels
its
motion
a
section
3
stay,
but
misses
the
mark
by
not
truly
grounding
it
in
section
3.
when
it
misses
the
mark,
their
outlet
--
their
pathway
to
interlocutory
appeal
ought
to
be
1292(b),
particularly
because
section
16(b)
indicates
congress
felt
that
was
a
compatible
accommodation
in
the
stay
--
in
the
arbitration
context.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
they
--
i
want
to
be
clear
that
the
rule
we
propose
as
to
these
claimants
asserting
equitable
estoppel
does
not
preclude
them
from
seeking
a
stay
--
stays
even
based
on
equitable
estoppel.
and
the
best
example
that
i
can
give
you
is
one
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
in
the
post-dsmc
era.
there's
a
case
called
toledano,
in
which
the
party
was
asserting
exactly
the
same
theory
that
--
that
petitioners
are:
equitable
estoppel
entitles
us
to
a
stay.
and
what
the
court
said
there
is,
well,
dsmc
has
come
down
and
said
you
cannot
under
section
3
predicate
a
stay
on
equitable
estoppel,
because
you
are
by
definition
saying
i
am
not
subject
to
a
written
agreement;
that's
the
predicate
for
section
3.
so
what
the
district
court
did
in
that
--
in
that
case,
it
entertained
the
stay
as
a
discretionary
stay,
and
it
granted
it.
it
granted
it
on
the
very
same
ground
that
my
friend
is
insisting
should
be
the
ground
for
a
mandatory
stay
in
the
post-dsmc
era;
it's
a
basis
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
a
discretionary
stay.
it
worked
exactly
the
same
way.
the
difference
was
you
--
you
were
true
to
the
language
of
section
3
and
you
were
true
to
the
language
of
section
16(a)(1)(a);
you
don't
have
the
runaway
stays
in
the
d.c.
circuit
that
you
have
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
eleventh
circuit
and
to
some
extent
in
the
fourth
circuit;
and
you
don't
have
the
interlocutory
appeals
from
those
except
under
1292.
i
want
to
come
back
to
a
--
to
a
question
that
was
--
that
was
asked
by

about
bricolage.
if
bricolage
were,
let's
say,
back
in
the
picture,
or
does
the
fact
that
bricolage
is
out
of
the
picture
make
a
difference?
the
only
sense
in
which
an
issue
in
this
case
was
ever
referable
to
arbitration
under
an
agreement
in
writing
is
under
the
bricolage
agreement.
once
bricolage
departed
the
case,
that
obligation
that
--
that
respondents
may
have
had
to
arbitrate
with
bricolage
became
inoperative,
and
what
i
see
petitioners
attempting
to
do
is
to
disaggregate
that
the
obligation
that
respondents
undertook
to
arbitrate
with
bricolage
from
bricolage's
reciprocal
obligation,
detach
it,
and
run
away
with
it
as
if
it's
a
fungible
commodity
and
say
we
are
now
owed
this
obligation,
when
--
contrary
to
everything
this
court
has
ever
said.
that's
not
the
way
the
faa
works,
because
with
the
faa
the
starting
point,
as
this
court
said
in
mitsubishi,
is
did
the
parties
agree
to
arbitrate
that
dispute?
and
if
we're
talking
about
the
--
the
absence
of
bricolage,
i
think
we're
--
we're
dealing
with
a
case
where
even
among
the
equitable
estoppel
cases,
this
case
will
turn
out
to
be
an
outlier
because
of
bricolage's
absence.
i
say
that
because
we're
also
dealing
with
accountants
who
were
their
accountants
for
25
years
before
bricolage
came
along.
we're
dealing
with
a
law
firm
that
had
a
written
retention
agreement,
had
a
contract
with
them
and
didn't
think
to
put
it
in
that
contract,
saying,
"oh,
pay
no
attention
to
that,
let
me
show
you
this
contract
that
they
signed
with
someone
else.
"
it
gets
back
to
justice
breyer's
point:
if
i
--
let's
say
i
unilaterally
published
in
the
washington
post,
"i
am
through
with
litigation,
henceforth
i
will
arbitrate
every
dispute
with
every
other
human
being
that
i
get
involved
in.
"
that's
not
a
section
3
agreement
to
arbitrate.
agreement
imports
the
notion
of
an
exchange
of
arbitration
obligations,
which
we
do
not
have
here.
bricolage
is
gone.
there's
no
question
that
this
--
that
the
premise
of
this
equitable
estoppel
argument
is
the
absence
of
a
--
of
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
should
be
overlooked
because
of
equity.
in
this--
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
--yes.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
right.
mr.
paul
m.
de
marco
that's
what
their
--
that's
apparently
their
argument,
and
the
problem
is
how
do
they
fill
that
gap.
they
attempt
to
fill
it
with
state
law.
i
think
state
law
does
not
apply,
the
language
of
section
3
applies,
your
honor,
and
section
3
cannot
get
them
there
from
here.
