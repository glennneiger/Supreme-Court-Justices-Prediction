why
is
that
necessarily
so?
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
that
question,
or
your
statement
that
your
argument
is
dependent
on
the
resolution
of
that
choice
of
law
issue.
are
the
courts
of
appeals
unanimous
on
the
question
of
whether
the
enforceability
of
an
arbitration
agreement
by
a
nonparty
is
a
question
of
state
law?
i
think
there's
at
least
a
fourth
circuit
decision
that
says
it's
a
question
of
federal
law,
but
why
--
why
do
we
have
to
decide
that
and
why
is
your
argument
dependent
on
it?
suppose
that
is
--
suppose
that
were
a
question
of
federal
law,
what
would
that
--
i
mean,
it
might
change
the
ultimate
outcome
of
whether
there's
an
entitlement
to
a
stay,
but
i
don't
see
why
it
has
any
effect
on
a
question
of
whether
there
is
jurisdiction.

nor
does
it
mean
that
you
necessarily
cannot
enforce
the
arbitration
agreement,
does
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
3
means
parties
to
the
arbitration
agreement,
would
that
mean
that
a
--
someone
who
is
not
a
party
to
the
litigation
could
file
a
stay
motion
under
section
3,
someone
who
is
not
a
party
to
the
litigation
but
is
a
party
to
the
arbitration
agreement?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
once
they
intervene,
they
are
a
party
to
the
litigation
as
well.
