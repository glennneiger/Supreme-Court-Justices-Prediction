justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
are
the
instances
in
which
somebody
who
is
not
a
signatory
might
seem
to
have
a
right
to
enforce
it?
i
can
think
of
one.
suppose
he's
a
third-party
beneficiary
of
the
contract.
are
there
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
which
one
applies
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
estoppel?
i
don't
understand
estoppel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
what
estoppel
is
in
the
law.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
i
haven't
unfortunately
had
a
chance
to
read
all
the
practice
treatises.
so,
could
you
explain
to
me
quite
simply
what
is
the
theory
of
equitable
estoppel
that
allows
someone
who
is
not
a
signatory
to
an
arbitration
contract
to
have
it
enforced?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
whenever
i
sign
a
contract
with
anybody
--
i
sign
one
with
smith,
i
ask
him
to
buy
some
wheat,
i
sell
him
some
wheat,
and
there's
an
arbitration
clause.
and
now
i
sue
all
kinds
of
other
people,
and
the
contract
is
part
of
the
lawsuit.
are
there
many
cases
like
that?
maybe
it
was
a
shipper,
or
something,
who
they
sent
the
contract
to,
and
he
had
to
figure
out
what
to
do
on
the
basis
of
the
contract.
or
maybe
there
was
a
cousin
who
told
me
to
go
to
see
smith
in
the
first
place.
maybe
--
i
don't
know.
there
are
a
lot
of
people.
so,
now
all
those
people
have
to
go
to
arbitration?
because
you're
saying
whenever
i
go
in
and
have
a
contract
with
x
and
there's
an
arbitration
clause,
then
in
any
future
lawsuit
where
i
sue
anybody
and
that
contract
is
an
essential
part
of
it,
the
breach
thereof,
he
could
put
me
in
arbitration.
boy,
that
sounds
extreme.
i
mean,
i
guess
there
are
--
there'd
have
to
be
several
treatises
on
this,
but
it
doesn't
sound
intuitively
sensible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
okay.
that's
all
i
wanted
to
know,
was
what's
the
theory
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
the
theory,
i
--
unless
i
think
it
always
applies,
i
could
just
say
i
don't
have
to
decide
about
a
third-party
beneficiary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
have
to
decide
whether
you
can
enforce
it.
now
--
so
you'd
better
say
some
other
things.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wouldn't
have
asked
my
question
if
you
hadn't
said
we
have
to
go
beyond
the
question
whether
they
had
jurisdiction
and
answer
the
merits,
which
is
whether
you
can
in
fact
enforce
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
you're
saying,
no,
we
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
could
just
rely
on
my
third-party
beneficiary
example?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
thought
the
first
issue
--
i
never
got
past
the
first
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
first
issue
was,
does
he
have
a
right
to
appeal?
and
i
read
the
statute,
and
to
me
section
16
says
yes.
he
asked
for
a
stay.
it
was
denied,
and
it
says
an
appeal
may
be
taken
from
an
order
refusing
a
stay.
so
there's
an
order
refusing
a
stay;
he
appealed.
why
can't
he
appeal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
other
example
in
the
law
--
i
can't
think
of
one
--
where
you
say
this
party
has
so
silly
an
argument,
which
is
really
what
you're
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
we
don't
even
let
him
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
to
me
i've
gotten
a
lot
of
appeals
where
the
appeal,
i
don't
think,
is
too
meritorious,
but
nonetheless
i
never
heard
of
saying
you
can't
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
to
that,
if
you
did
that,
i
got
your
first
point.
i
understand
it.
i
agree
with
it.
as
to
the
second
point,
you
say
--
i
was
surprised
because
i
hadn't
quite
taken
that
in
--
that
we
are
now
supposed
to
reach
what
we
would
call
the
merits
of
the
appeal.
now,
there
you
just
heard
your
co-counsel
say:
look,
you
don't
have
to
decide
whether
my
equitable
theory
is
good
or
not.
you
haven't
read
these
treatises,
i
have;
which
is
a
fair
comment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
all
i
want
you
to
say
is
that
sometimes,
at
least,
a
third
party
could
enforce
a
contract
to
arbitration
that
two
others
make.
the
statute
doesn't
say
he
can't.
the
statute
doesn't
say
he
has
to
be
the
one
who
signed
it.
and
if
you
think
of
a
third-party
beneficiary
or
an
assignment,
for
example,
you
would
think,
of
course,
there
are
other
people,
say
an
assignee,
who
could
enforce
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
proper
--
i
see.
this
is
actually
a
pretty
difficult
question
to
me,
and
--
because
it
seems
to
me
sometimes
they
have
to
be
able
to
enforce
it,
the
assignee,
the
third-party
beneficiary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
what
i
don't
know,
is
--
what
they're
doing
--
it's
true
that
section
3
and
all
the
other
sections,
they
talk
about
the
agreement,
but
they
don't
say
that
the
individual
who
is
asking
for
the
stay
has
to
be
the
same
person
who
signed
it,
as
they
couldn't.
so
how
do
we
know
which
among
all
the
possible
people
in
the
case
who
hasn't
signed
it
should
and
should
not
be
able
to
enforce
it?
their
argument
is
look
to
state
law,
okay?
and
your
argument
is
derive
some
principles
yourself.
really.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so,
so
--
is
it
possible
to
answer
this
case
by
saying
he's
wrong
in
thinking
you
always
look
to
state
law.
it
may
depend
on
what
the
state
law
says.
so
that's
the
answer
to
the
question.
you
should
have
had
your
appeal.
go
appeal,
and
let
the
courts
below
work
that
out
first,
knowing
that
the
state
law
is
relevant
but
not
always
determinative.
then
we'll
get
some
--
we'll
get
some
case
law
on
this
and
we'll
be
in
a
better
position
to
figure
out
what
the
right
answer
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
see
it's
a
little
hard.
i
can
imagine
a
case
where
they're
sitting
in
the
room
drawing
up
the
contract,
they
put
it
in
the
arbitration
agreement.
there
are
four
other
people
directly
related
to
the
room.
the
parties
look
around
and
say,
hey,
we
have
arbitration
here,
i
hope
everybody
understands
everybody
is
going
to
have
to
do
this.
and
they
all
say,
okay,
don't
worry
about
it.
now,
i'd
say,
hey,
maybe
they're
estopped.
and
there
they're
going
right
through
the
contract.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
hate
to
write
the
words
"equitable
estoppel
is
never
relevant".
i
would
rather
write
the
words
"i'm
uncertain
state
law
is
relevant
policy.
"
you
know,
it's
not
true
that
it's
always
relevant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
would
you
think
about
saying
that
some
parties
--
some
parties
to
the
case
who
are
not
parties
to
the
contract
can
as
third
parties,
nonetheless,
enforce
arbitration?
we
have
listed
a
few
examples,
assignees,
et
cetera.
when
considering
whether
this
is
one
of
them,
judge,
the
key
question
--
we
can
tell
you
what
the
key
question
is
and
what
it
isn't.
what
it
is
has
to
do
with
the
intent
of
the
persons
who
did
sign
the
contract.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
something
related
to
that.
we
don't
have
to
be
specific.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
it
isn't
is
a
case
management
device.
because
what
i
think
the
temptation
would
be
for
the
judge
is
to
--
is
to
--
let's
send
them
all
off
to
arbitration
if
we
can,
and
then
i
would
not
have
to
worry
about
this
case
for
a
while.
and
they'll
come
back,
and
they'll
figure
it
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
that
--
is
that
right,
or
is
it
wrong?
what's
your
insight
or
guess
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
looking
for
ways
of
separating
these
sheep
from
goats.
