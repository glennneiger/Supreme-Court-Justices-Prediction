justice
david
h.
souter
i
--
i
don't
see
that
the
--
that
the
section
3
stay
follows
from
that.
it
may
very
well
be
that
in
whatever
ultimate
forum
the
case
is
thrashed
out
in
that
the
--
that
the
non-signatories
will
be
able
to
enforce
the
arbitration
agreement.
the
question
here
is
whether
they
can
get
a
stay
in
midstream
in
order
to
litigate
that
as
a
separate
issue.
and
one
argument
for
saying
that
they
should
not,
that
the
stay
right
should
be
limited
to
signatories,
is
that
the
policy
of
the
--
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
to
enforce
arbitration
agreements.
it
is
not
a
policy
simply
to
promote
arbitration
under
all
possible
circumstances.
it
is
a
policy
to
enforce
contracts
because
the
contracts,
in
effect,
were
being
given
short
shrift
before
the
act
was
passed.
if
the
policy
is
one
to
enforce
contracts
and,
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
they
had
a
chance
to
make
an
arbitration
agreement
and
they
didn't
do
it,
then
that
is
a
good
reason
to
say
the
federal
courts
will
not
stay
the
proceedings
in
midstream
for
somebody
who
didn't
get
the
agreement
that
that
person
could
have
gotten.
what
is
your
answer
to
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
including
--
and
--
and
you're
saying
that
that
covers,
in
effect,
even
a
point
of
federal
procedure
as
to
whether
you
get,
in
practical
terms,
an
interlocutory
appeal.
that's
a
question
of
state
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
question
here
is:
what
is
the
procedure
to
be
followed
in
a
federal
court
when
there
is
disagreement
about
that?
and
to
say
that
that
is
a
question
of
state
law
strikes
me
as
a
stretch.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
--
may
i
ask
you
this?
let's
assume
state
law
said
we
--
we
don't
recognize
stays
at
this
stage
of
the
game.
therefore,
we
will
not
give
a
stay
to
anyone.
would
state
law
prevail?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
the
problem?
that's
what
i'm
getting
at.
isn't
that
the
problem
for
you
in
this
case?
because
you
keep
arguing
that
their
substantive
rights
under
the
agreement
are
issues
of
state
law,
but
the
question
before
us
is
not
one
of
ultimate
substantive
right.
at
some
point
there
will
be
an
--
an
appellate
process
open
to
them
and
they
can
assert
those
substantive
rights
if
they
didn't
get
them
at
trial.
the
issue
here
is
not
substantive
right.
the
issue
here
is
a
procedural
right,
and
it's
a
procedural
right
which
depends
upon
the
terms
of
the
federal
statute,
and
that's
why
it
seems
to
me
that
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
federal
statute
determines
not
only
the
procedural
right,
the
stay,
but
who
may
ask
for
it,
that
being
a
sensible
federal
question
rather
than
a
state
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
your
argument
depends
upon,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
reading
section
2
as
in
effect
incorporating
state
law
for
purposes
of
determining
substantive
rights.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
that
still
begs
the
question
whether
the
--
whether
the
incorporation
of
state
law
to
determine
substantive
rights
controls
the
question
of
what
law
determines
procedural
rights,
when
a
federal
procedural
right
is
claimed,
which
is
what
is
involved
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
regardless
of
state
law,
the
answer
to
the
federal
question
is
independent
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i'm
--
i'm
missing
the
logic
of
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
are
federal
procedural
devices,
and
state
law
could
not
contradict
them.
that's
--
that's
what
we
got
into
when
i
said
what
if
state
law
said
there
could
be
no
stay?
you
agree
at
that
point
that
of
course
the
federal
law
would
prevail?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would
apply
to
what
the
judge
is
supposed
to
do
at
that
moment
when
somebody
says,
i
want
a
stay.
and
the
judge
at
that
point
consults
federal
law,
not
state
law,
doesn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
just
stick
to
my
question.
he
says:
i
want
a
stay.
does
the
judge
look
to
state
law
or
federal
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
and
what
is
the
criterion
for
identifying
a
section
3
stay?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
your
--
and
your
position
is
that
the
statute
should
be
so
construed
that
only
a
signatory
to
the
written
agreement
has
a
right
to
the
stay,
indeed
has
a
right
to
request
the
stay
under
article
3?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
your
reason
for
saying
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
why
shouldn't
the
federal
law
be
even
simpler
than
that?
and
i
--
i
proposed
one,
and
--
and
probably
because
i
don't
understand
the
law
well
enough,
it
may
--
may
have
been
simply
simplistic.
but
my
suggestion
was
the
--
the
issue
before
us
should
be
construed
narrowly
as
being
the
question:
who
can
ask
for
a
stay?
and
the
answer
to
that
would
be
only
a
person
--
or
one
possible
answer
to
that
would
be
only
a
person
who
has
signed
the
arbitration
agreement,
because
the
federal
policy
is
to
enforce
agreements,
not
force
arbitration.
and,
therefore,
it
is
sensible
as
a
matter
of
federal
policy
to
say,
we're
not
going
to
stop
this
trial
in
mid-track
for
arbitration
unless
you
who
are
asking
for
it
to
be
stopped
signed
an
arbitration
agreement
yourself,
and
it's
that
agreement
that
you're
trying
to
enforce.
now,
that
is
maybe
a
--
a
too
simplistic
approach,
but
tell
me
what's
good
or
bad
about
that
approach.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
that
opens
the
door
to
my
simplistic
theory.
now--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
it
a
good
theory
or
a
bad
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
not
enough,
because
"under
the
written
agreement"
leaves
open
the
question
of
whether
the
written
agreement
can
be
enforced
right
here
and
now
by
getting
a
stay
only
by
somebody
who
signed
it
or
by
a
third-party
beneficiary
or
--
or
somebody
dependent
on
the
contract
plus
some
other
legal
theory.
my
simplistic
suggestion
was:
keep
it
simple
and
simply
say
the
--
"under
the
agreement"
means
an
agreement
signed
by
you,
and
the
reason
we
confine
it
to
an
agreement
signed
by
you
is
not
because
the
phrase
"under
this
agreement"
tells
us
that.
it
doesn't.
that
leaves
the
question
open.
we
say
it
is
going
to
be
confined
to
an
agreement
signed
by
you
because
that's
really
the
--
the
nub
of
the
federal
policy.
we
want
to
enforce
agreements,
and
we
want
to
confine
this
extraordinary
remedy
of
a
stay
to
people
who
went
to
enough
trouble
to
make
--
and
i
don't
know
whether
that's
a
good
idea
or
not.
and
--
i
mean
it's
favorable
to
you,
so
it's
in
your
interest
to
say
it's
a
good
idea,
but
i
may
be
getting
into
trouble
by
that.
and
that's
what
i
want
you
to
tell
me.
