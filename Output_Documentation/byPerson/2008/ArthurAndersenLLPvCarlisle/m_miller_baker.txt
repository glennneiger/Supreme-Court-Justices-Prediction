mr.
m.
miller
baker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
nonparties
to
an
arbitration
agreement
that
are
otherwise
entitled
to
enforce
that
agreement
under
state
law
are
foreclosed
as
a
matter
of
law
from
seeking
relief
under
section
3
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
respondents'
argument
that
section
3
forecloses
such
relief
to
nonparties
is
contrary
to
both
the
text
of
section
3
and
the
structure
of
the
faa.
nothing
in
the
text
of
section
3
forecloses
nonparty
enforcement
rights,
and
under
the
structure
of
the
act
section
3
is
a
procedural
device
to
enforce,
rather
than
a
substantive
limitation
upon,
state-law
arbitration
rights
made
applicable
by
section
2.
i'll
begin
with
the
text
of
section
3.
under
section
3,
a
stay
is
mandatory
if
the
issue
in
suit
is,
quote,
"referable
to
arbitration
under
such
an
agreement.
"
we
contend
that
there
are
three
elements
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
issue
is
referable
to
arbitration
under
the
agreement.
first,
the
applicant
must
be
able
to
enforce
the
agreement.
second,
the
plaintiff
must
be
bound
by
the
agreement.
and,
third,
the
claim
must
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
agreement.
nothing
in
section
3
limits
who
can
enforce
the
agreement.
to
answer
that
question
we
have
to
turn
to
section
2.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
your
honor,
it's
--
it's
clear
from
the
--
from
the
context
it's
referring
to
parties
to
the
action.
likewise,
in
section
4
there's
a
reference
to
parties,
and
it's
parties
to
the
controversy.
so
section
3
refers
to
parties
to
the
action
in
which
the
section
3
stay
is
sought.
section
4,
likewise,
the
companion
enforcement
provision,
refers
to
parties
to
the
controversy.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
well,
4,
your
honor,
as
opposed
to
section
3.
but
the
controversy
in
this
case
is
a
tort
claim
against
various
defendants.
and
that
--
the
petitioners
in
this
case
assert
that
they
are
entitled
to
enforce
the
arbitration
clause,
and
under
that
clause
this
controversy
is
supposed
to
be
arbitrated.
now,
section
2
is
the
primary
substantive
provision
of
the
act.
section
2
establishes
that
questions
concerning
the
enforceability
of
an
arbitration
agreement,
including
who
may
enforce
that
agreement,
are
decided
by
state
law.
this
court's
decision
in
perry
v.
thomas
recognized
and
applied
this
principle.
in
perry,
this
court
remanded
to
state
court
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
nonparties
could
enforce
an
arbitration
agreement.
in
so
doing,
this
court
instructed
the
lower
court
to
apply
state
law
to
determine
the
very
question
that's
before
this
case,
whether
non
--
before
this
court,
whether
nonparties
could
enforce
the
arbitration
agreement.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
yes,
there
have
been,
your
honor.
and
there
--
there
are
numerous
cases.
in
fact,
for
the
last
60
years
it
has
been
a
recognized,
settled
principle
of
faa
law
that
nonparties
to
an
arbitration
agreement
that
are
otherwise
entitled
to
enforce
the
agreement
are
able
to
seek
and
obtain
stays
under
section
3.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
well,
your
honor,
it
depends
upon
the
facts
and
the
law.
it
may
well
be
that
those
nonparties
have
no
arbitration
rights,
in
which
case
a
section
3
stay
would
not
be
available
--
available
to
them.
the
question
is
whether
they
have
rights
under
state
law.
if
they
do
have
rights
under
state
law
to
enforce
the
arbitration
agreement
to
which
they
are
not
parties,
then
they
are
entitled
to
a
section
3
stay.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
section
2,
your
honor,
sets
the
policy
of
the
faa,
and
section
2
establishes
that
state
law
determines
the
rights
and
obligations
of
nonparties
to
an
arbitration
agreement.
if
nonparties
have
rights--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--your
honor,
that
brings
us
to
the
question
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
but
first
let
me
deal
with
the
merits.
section
3,
as
this
court
has
recognized
on
various
occasions,
is
a
procedural
device
to
enforce
the
substantive
policy
of
section
2.
it
has
no
substantive
component
on
its
own.
section
2
establishes
--
settles
the
question
of
who
may
enforce
or
is
bound
by
an
arbitration
agreement.
it
settles
that
question
by
directing
a
court
to
look
to
state
law.
section
3
is--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--your
honor,
section
3
is
a
procedural
device
to
enforce
state
law
arbitration
rights.
section
--
likewise,
section
4
is
the
same
thing.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
your
honor,
that
was
the
reading
of
this
court
in
the
perry
v.
thomas
decision
in
1987.
this
court
construed
section
2
as
being
a
touchstone
for
choice
of
law
and
that
section
2
required
the
court
concerning
questions
concerning
the
enforceability
of
an
arbitration
agreement
to
look
to
state
law
to
answer
those
questions.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
absolutely.
that
was
the
precise
question
before
the
court
in
perry,
and
this
court
remanded
to
the
california
court
of
appeals
to
determine
whether
non-signatories
to
an
arbitration
agreement
could
enforce
that
agreement.
the
california
court
of
appeals
on
remand
held
that
they
could
under
a
theory
of
agency,
which
is
indistinguishable
in
principle
from
the
theory
that
the
petitioners
are
asserting
here
today.
respondents'
theory,
their
interpretation
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
would
wipe
out
six
decades
of
faa
case
law
recognizing
that
nonparties
have
enforcement
rights.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
your
honor,
the
bankruptcy
of
bricolage
has
no
effect
whatsoever
on
our
rights
under
state
law
to
enforce
the
agreement.
it
is
what
it
is,
but--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--well,
the
respondents
might
--
might
contend
so,
and
they
--
they
are
free
to
argue
on
remand
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
bankruptcy
in
any
way
affects
our
rights,
whether
we
can
prevail
under
equitable
estoppel
in
this
case.
but
for
purposes
of
this
court,
the
question
that
we
--
that
the
court
has
to
decide
is
whether
or
not
as
a
matter
of
law
a
nonparty
is
foreclosed
from
seeking
relief
under
section
3,
and
section
3
does
not
foreclose
such
relief
because
section
2
establishes
the
principle
that
this
--
that
a
court
is
to
look
to
state
law
to
determine
the
question
of
who
can
enforce
an
arbitration
agreement.
so
we're
saying
that
respondents'
theory
of
the
case
would
wipe
out
60
years
of
faa
case
law
recognizing
that
nonparties
have
arbitration
rights.
theories
such
as
third-party
beneficiary,
assignment,
agency,
estoppel,
including
equitable
estoppel,
assumption,
successor
in
interest,
none
of
those
cases
can
survive
effectively
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit.
i
will
now
turn
to
section
16
and
the
question
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
respondents,
like
the
court
below,
erroneously
conflate
the
merits
of
the
section
3
issue
with
appellate
jurisdiction.
thus
if
you
reject
their
interpretation
of
section
3,
necessarily
their
appellate
jurisdiction
argument
fails.
but
that
--
their
theory
of
appellate
jurisdiction
nevertheless
should
be
rejected
on
its
own
merits.
under
section
16,
and
that's
found
at
page
3
of
the
blue
brief
--
an
appeal
may
be
taken
from
an
order
refusing
a
stay
of
any
action
under
this
title.
this
establishes
a
broad
category
of
orders
that
are
immediately
appealable.
the
sixth
circuit
below
used
a
signatory
test
to
determine
whether
it
had
appellate
jurisdiction.
now,
this
test
is
legally
erroneous,
as
respondents
concede.
for
70
years
--
excuse
me
--
80
years,
the
federal
arbitration
act
has
been
understood
not
to
contain
a
signatory
requirement.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
your
honor,
state
law
controls
the
question
of
who
may
enforce
the
agreement,
who
has
rights
and
obligations
under
the
agreement.
sections
3
and
4
control
the
question
of
whether
relief
is
available
in
federal
court.
the
procedural
devices
to
enforce
state-law
arbitration
rights
may
vary
from
state
to
federal
court,
but
the
principle
of
who--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--your
honor,
the
premise
of
your
question
drives
a
wedge
between
section
2
and
section
3
that
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
--
court's
decision
in
bernhardt.
this
court
in
bernhardt
said
that
section
3
cannot
be
read
apart
from
section
2.
section
--
this
court
has
never
characterized
section
3
or
section
4
as
containing
any
substantive
elements.
such--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--it
absolutely
does.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that's
--
that's
correct.
and
sections
--
it
is
a
federal
question
as
to
what
sections
3
and
4
require.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
the
logic
of
the
argument
is
that
section
3
and
section
4,
as
this
court
has
said
on
several
occasions,
are
devices
to
enforce
the
principle
of
arbitration
enforceability
outlined
in
section
2.
section
2
establishes
the
substantive
principle
here.
sections
3
and
4
are
mere
procedural
devices.
under--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--that
would
apply
to
--
that
would
apply
to
the
question
of
the
--
the
action
in
that
court,
but
in
the
federal
court
the
threshold--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--that
--
on
the
procedural
question
of
what
procedural
mechanism--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--the
judge
first
looks
to
the
question
of
who
can
enforce
the
agreement,
and
to
ask
that
--
to
answer
that
question,
the
judge
has
to
look
to
state
law.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
i
don't
think
it
has
any
question
--
effect
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
it
means
that
--
well,
you
have
to
look
to
a
source
of
law
to
determine
whether
a
nonparty
has
rights
under
an
arbitration
agreement.
i'm
aware
of
that
fourth
circuit
case.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
court
was
incorrect.
i
believe
this
court's
decisions
in
perry
and
ensuing
cases
make
it
clear
that
state
law
determines
the
rights
and
obligations
of
nonparties
to
an
arbitration
agreement.
that's
a
settled
principle.
and
so
that
is
a
threshold
question
that
has
to
be--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
are
you
referring
to
appellate
jurisdiction
or
jurisdiction
under
the
faa?
mr.
m.
miller
baker
the
answer,
your
honor,
is
clearly
yes.
if
we're
talking
about--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--your
honor,
i
turned
to
the
merits
first
because
the
sixth
circuit
below
erroneously
conflated
two
entirely
distinct
concepts.
the
first
is
appellate
jurisdiction--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--all
right.
well,
i'll
start
with
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
all
right.
section
16
makes
it
clear
that
all
one
needs
to
have
for
appellate
jurisdiction
is
a
motion
under
section
3
for
a
stay
pending
appeal,
and
that
is
denied.
that
establishes
a
broad
category
of
orders.
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
apply
that
test.
the
sixth
circuit
used
a--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--if
a
--
if
a
party
--
if
a
litigant
makes
a
section
3
stay
and
they
claim
no
right
to
enforce
the
arbitration
agreement,
the
denial
of
that
stay
would
be
appealable,
all
right,
because
section
16--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--no,
because
they
--
the
spectator
is
not
even
a
party,
your
honor,
to
the
litigation.
section
3
contemplates
parties
to
the
litigation
seeking
a
stay.
on
the
question
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
if
a
litigant
makes
a
request
for
a
section
3
stay
and
the
stay
request
is
denied,
there
is
clearly
appellate
jurisdiction
under
section
16.
that
is
--
in
our
view.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that's
our
jurisdictional
argument,
that
the
mere
request
for
relief
under
section
3
and
the
denial
of
that
request
triggers
appellate
jurisdiction.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that's
not
all
that's
before
you.
unfortunately,
the
sixth
circuit
below
conflated
the
question
of
whether
there's
appellate
jurisdiction
with
whether
non-signatories
can
seek
relief
under
section
3.
that's
why
it's
essential
for
the
court
to
reach
the
second
questioned
presented,
which
is
whether
non-signatories
as
a
matter
of
law
are
foreclosed
from
seeking
relief
under
section
3.
the
court
below
--
i'll
turn
back
to
appellate
jurisdiction
to
--
your
honor.
the
court
below
used
a
fact-based
test;
that
is,
is
the
party
seeking
relief
a
signatory
to
the
agreement?
that
--
that
cannot
be
the
law.
eighty
years
of
faa
law
establishes
that
you
don't
have
to
be
a
signatory
to
enforce
an
arbitration
agreement.
in
addition,
it
violates
this
court's
rule
that
you
look
to
categories
of
orders,
rather
than
the
facts
of
a
given
case
to
determine
appellate
jurisdiction.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
well,
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
there's
assignment,
successor
in
interest,
assumption,
estoppel.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
there's
a
whole--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--well,
estoppel,
and
there
are--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--well,
your
honor,
it's
a
theory
that
was--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--more
precisely,
it's
equitable
estoppel,
but
the
--
the
practice
treatises
have
entire
chapters
devoted
to--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--yes,
your
honor.
the
theory
here
is
that
the
respondents
asserted
claims
of
--
of
concerted
misconduct,
of
conspiracy
against
the
petitioners,
some
of
whom
were
--
one
of
--
well,
none
of
whom
were
signatories
to
the
arbitration
agreement
and
bricolage
which
did
--
was
a
signatory
to
the
agreement,
that
claim
of
concerted
misconduct,
in
our
view,
where
the
respondents
are
relying
upon
the
agreement,
that
is
the
agreement
that
they
entered
into
with
bricolage
to
--
is
the
theory
upon
which
they
are
now
seeking
relief
from
us.
they
are
claiming
that
this
contract
that
contains
the
arbitration
clause
was
an
instrumentality
for
the
fraud
that
was
perpetrated
on
them.
because
of
that
they
are
now
estopped
from
seeking
--
claiming
that
they
are
not
--
not
obligated
to
arbitrate
under
the
agreement.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
well,
your
honor,
we're
not
saying
that
that
applies
in
every
case.
there's
more--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--the
theory
of
equitable
estoppel.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
your
honor--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--well,
your
honor,
give
me--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--well,
that's
--
that's
the
first
error
of
the
court
of
appeals,
but
the
court
of
--
the
second
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
to
decide
--
was
to
hold
as
a
matter
of
law
that
section
3
does
not
allow
nonparties
to
enforce
an
arbitration
agreement.
the
question
of
the
merits
of
equitable
estoppel
is
not
before
this
court,
your
honor,
and
it
may
well
be
on
remand
in
the
sixth
circuit
that--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--your
honor--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--your
honor,
the
merits
--
there
are
two
parts
to
the
merits.
the
first
is
whether
as
a
matter
of
law
nonparties
are
foreclosed
from
seeking
relief
under
section
3.
that
--
that
is
all
this
court
need
decide.
that
is
what
the
question--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--as
an
example?
exactly.
a
third-party
beneficiary
can
enforce
an
agreement
as
a
matter
--
is
entitled
to
enforce
--
to
use
section
3.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
if
he
can
do
it
under
state
law.
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
satisfied
the
requirements
of
equitable
estoppel
is
not
before
the
court.
that's
a
question
to
be
decided
on
remand
by
the
sixth
circuit.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
thank
you,
your
honor.
on
the
question
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
the
petitioners
here
made
a
motion
for
relief
under
section
3,
and
that
motion
was
denied.
therefore,
there
is
jurisdiction
under
section
16
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
we
were
entitled
to
relief
under
section
3.
respondents
have
made
a
very
important
concession
that
decides
this
case.
respondents
concede
that
under
section
3
nonparties
can
enforce
an
arbitration
agreement
through
the
mechanism
of
section
3.
that
decides
this
case.
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
on
these
facts,
these
nonparty
petitioners
can
actually
enforce
section
3.
the
--
the
petitioners'
quarrel
is
with
the
doctrine
of
equitable
estoppel.
they
don't
like
it,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
text
of
section
3
that
allows
this
court
or
any
court
to
distinguish
between
the
various
doctrines
or
legal
theories
that
nonparties
may
seek
to
which
--
to
enforce
section
3.
we
happen
to
have
used
section
3,
happen
to
have
invoked
equitable
estoppel
as
the
basis
for
invoking
section
3,
but
it
could
have
been
assignment,
it
could
have
been
third-party
beneficiary.
they
have
--
respondents
have
conceded
the
principle
that
section
3
is
available
to
provide
relief
to
nonparties
who
are
otherwise
entitled
to
enforce
the
agreement.
they
just
think
that
on
the
merits
we
don't
satisfy
the
requirements
of
equitable
estoppel.
that's
a
question
to
be
decided
on
remand.
equitable
estoppel,
i
will
say
very
briefly,
presupposes
the
existence
of
a
written
arbitration
agreement.
in
the
absence
of
a
written
arbitration
agreement,
petitioners
here
would
not
have
any
ability
to
assert
this
theory
of
equitable
estoppel.
so
--
so
it's
not
completely
separated
from
or
detached
from
the
existence
of
a
written
arbitration
agreement.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
justice
souter's
signatory
test
for
allowing
relief
under
section
3.
with
all
respect,
this
defies
80
years
of
case
law
interpreting
the
federal
arbitration
act.
it
defies
the
history
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
it's
settled
that
congress,
in
enacting
this
act,
chose
new
york
law,
and
the
new
york
arbitration
act
lad
a
much
more
stringent
requirement
for
arbitrating
existing
disputes
which
required
a
signature.
congress,
as
we
outlined
in
our
brief,
did
not
choose
that
section
of
the
new
york
law
as
a
model
when
it
enacted
the
faa
in
1925.
1292(b)
--
the
right
to
appellate
jurisdiction
is
illusory
because
if
that
is
denied,
a
nonparty
with
arbitration
rights
would
be
forced
to
litigate
and
lose
the
very
things
that
arbitration
is
designed
to
avoid
--
that
is,
the
cost
and
time
of
being
in
litigation
in
a
district
court.
not
only
that,
the
district
court
will
suffer
the
loss
of
judicial
efficiency
by
having
to
litigate
--
litigate
a
case
before
it
or
adjudicate
a
case
that
should
be
in
arbitration.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
will
conclude
the
argument.
