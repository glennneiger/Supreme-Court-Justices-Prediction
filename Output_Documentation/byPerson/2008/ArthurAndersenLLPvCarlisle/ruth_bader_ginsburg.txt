before
you
leave
the
text,
it
says
as
you
--
"referable
to
arbitration
under
an
agreement.
"
but
then
it
says
"shall
on
application
of
one
of
the
parties.
"
how
do
we
know
whether
that
is
parties
to
the
litigation
or
parties
to
the
arbitration
agreement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
practice,
are
there
decisions
in
which
--
and
i'm
assuming
that
you
are
right
on
the
jurisdictional
question
--
in
which
a
nonparty
to
the
arbitration
agreement
but
a
party
to
the
litigation
has,
in
fact,
succeeded
in
getting
a
stay
under
section
3?
i
mean,
one
question
is
--
and
that's
the
question
on
the
merits
--
assuming
that
a
--
that
a
party
to
the
litigation,
not
a
party
to
the
arbitration
agreement,
can
come
to
court
and
say,
court,
stay
the
action
pending
arbitration.
have
there
been
cases
in
which
section
3
stays
have
been
issued
on
the
request
of
someone
who
is
not
party
to
the
arbitration
agreement
but
is
a
litigant
in
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
question
--
ability
is
one
thing.
it
means
they
--
they
have
the
capacity
to
apply
under
section
3.
i
was
just
wondering
how
in
practice
--
i
mean,
here's
a
case
where
you
have
three
parties
together
counseling
a
certain
tax
shelter.
one
of
them
enters
an
arbitration
agreement
with
the
enterprise
that
they
are
advising.
the
other
two,
sophisticated
players,
do
not.
my
question
is,
conceding
jurisdiction,
it
seems
to
me
unlikely
that
a
court
would
listen
to
two
such
people
who
were
perfectly
equipped
to
get
an
arbitration
agreement
themselves
and
didn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
any
situation
--
and
this
one
is
really
peculiar
because
the
one
party
who
has
the
arbitration
agreement
with
carlisle
is
now
out
of
it,
and
is
not
going
to
get
back
in,
because
--
is
it
bricolage
--
is
bankrupt,
so
there
is
an
automatic
stay
of
any
litigation
against
bricolage.
the
one
party
that
has
the
arbitration
agreement
is
out
of
the
picture,
so
you
have
an
arbitration
agreement
effectively
with
no
one,
that
two
parties
who
have
no
arbitration
agreement
are
trying
to
enforce:
the
difference
between
parties
to
the
litigation
joining
in
an
ongoing
arbitration
brought
by
either
party
to
the
arbitration
agreement,
and
relying
on
an
arbitration
agreement
effectively
without
two
parties
to
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
have
a
party
to
the
agreement
who
is
no
longer
in
the
picture,
doesn't
that
change
things?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
read
section
3,
if
you
interpret,
as
you
do,
the
word
"parties"
to
mean
parties
to
the
litigation,
then
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction
the
only
thing
is,
is
this
person
a
party
to
the
litigation?
yes.
end
of
case;
they
can
move
for
a
stay.
then
whether
they're
entitled
to
one
because
of
this
equitable
estoppel
theory
which
is
determined
by
the
state
law
is
a
merits
question.
you
are
making
a
more
complex
jurisdictional
argument
than
i
understand.
what's
wrong
with
the
simple
argument
that
section
3
says
parties;
that
means
parties
to
the
litigation;
the
--
the
petitioners
here
are
parties
to
the
litigation;
therefore,
they
can
move
for
a
stay
of
the
arbitration?
and
then
we
go
to
the
merits
and
say,
do
they
have
a
good
reason
for
staying
the
arbitration?
but
you're
presenting
a
more
complex
argument
on
the
jurisdictional
point
which
i
don't
quite
understand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
first,
is
there
jurisdiction
--
yes,
appellate
jurisdiction.
if
you
--
if
there's
an
application
to
stay,
is
that
appealable?
why
isn't
--
why
isn't
the
answer
clearly
yes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
step
--
you
seem
to
be
involving
some
merits
question
of
state
law
in
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
shouldn't
do
that.
you
should
tell
us,
this
is
the
jurisdictional
argument.
if
we
pass
that
threshold,
then
we
get
to
the
merits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
good.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask?
suppose
it's
somebody
who
has
interest
in
the
litigation
but
is
not
a
party
either
to
the
arbitration
agreement
or
to
the
litigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
if
somebody
who
is
not
a
litigant,
who
can
--
if
somebody
who
is
an
interested
spectator
moves
for
a
stay
of
litigation
to
which
that
person
is
not
a
party,
and
the
court
says
of
course
not.
would
that
be
reviewable
on
appeal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
your
jurisdictional
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you're
saying
that's
all
that's
before
us
because
it
was
thrown
out
on--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
might
say
that
they
haven't
stated
a
claim
on
which
relief
can
be
granted,
but
that
is
the
merits
question.
we
are
supposed
to
be
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
the
denial
of
the
stay
--
there
was
a
denial
of
a
stay
--
is
appealable
under
section
16.
and
to
decide
that
question
i
don't
think
you
get
into
how
meritorious
their
claim
was
for
the
stay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
you
just
told
us
that
section
3
was
ambiguous.
you
don't
know
if
the
reference
to
"parties"
means
parties
to
the
arbitration
agreement
or
parties
in
the
litigation.
so
how
can
we
take
it
--
we
take
it
seriously,
yes,
and
say
there's
an
ambiguity.
we
don't
know
from
the
text
which
is
the
proper
reference,
parties
to
the
agreement
or
parties
to
the
litigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
recognize
that
there
is
some
appeal
possibility,
because
you
already
said
or
at
least
you
said
in
your
brief
that
12
might
--
to
get
this
question
settled
about
the
equitable
estoppel
and
going
to
arbitration
--
that
the
district
court
in
its
discretion
could
give
a
1292(b)
order
and
say,
i
want
to
get
this
issue
settled
on
appeal
before
i
go
on
with
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
be
all
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
district
judge
could
say,
i'm
going
to
treat
this
as
a
1292(b)
issue,
and
i'm
going
to
grant
the
stay
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
tell
--
can
tell
me
what
the
law
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
bricolage
did
move
to
compel.
it
did
move
for
a
stay,
did
make
a
section
3--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--application,
and
then
it
--
it
became
bankrupt
and
got
the
benefit
of
the
automatic
stay
in
bankruptcy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
--
and
i
take
it
that
andersen
and
curtis
are
saying,
we
have
a
right
to
be
substituted
for
bricolage.
that's--
