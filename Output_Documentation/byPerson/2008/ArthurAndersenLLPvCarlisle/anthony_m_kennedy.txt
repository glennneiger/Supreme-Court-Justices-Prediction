justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--one
of
the
things
you're
going
to
say
is
that,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
breyer,
this
conflates
the
merits
with
the
jurisdictional
problem,
which
is
exactly
the
mistake
that
the
court
of
appeals
made.
is
that
your
theory
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
do
you
do
with
third-party
beneficiary,
assignment,
assumption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
a
way
that
was
where
one
of
the
parties,
without
the
other
party's
consent,
say,
assigned
a
third-party
beneficiary.
here
in
a
way
it's
a
fortiori
because
the
party
who
is
objecting,
by
his
or
its
own
actions,
caused
the
agreement
to
come
into
play.
that's
their
theory.

the
petitioners
are
an
accounting
firm,
a
law
firm
and
various
affiliates.
they
advised
and
assisted
respondents
who
were
wayne

james
bushman,
and
garry
strassel
in
implementing
a
tax
shelter.
as
part
of
the
arrangement,
carlisle,
bushman,
and
strassel
created
limited
liability
corporations.
these
corporations
which
are
also

agreements

agreements
with

now,
the
investment
management
agreements
provided
for
the
arbitration
of
disputes.
after
the
internal
revenue
service
found
the
tax
shelter
illegal,
respondents
filed
a
diversity
suit
against
petitioners
and
bricolage.
the
suit
alleged
fraud,
civil
conspiracy
malpractice,
breach
of
fiduciary
duties,
and
negligence.
petitioners
in
response
filed
motions
to
stay
proceedings
under
section
3
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
called
faa.
they
argued
that
principles
of
equitable
estoppel
required
respondents
to
arbitrate
their
claims
under
the
agreements
with
bricolage.
the
district
court
denied
petitioners'
stay
motions
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
dismissed
their
interlocutory
appeal
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
we
granted
certiorari.
at
the
outset,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
determining
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
review
the
district
court's
denial
of
petitionersâ€™
stay
request.
section
3
of
the
faa
entitles
litigants
to
stay
any
action
that
is
referable
to
arbitration
under
an
agreement
in
writing.
section
16
(a)(1)(a)
in
turn
allows
an
appeal
from
an
order
refusing
a
stay
of
any
action
under
section
3.
by
its
clear
and
unambiguous
terms,
16
(a)(1)(a)
entitles
any
litigant
asking
for
a
section
3
stay
to
an
immediate
appeal
for
the
motion's
denial,
regardless
of
whether
the
litigant
is
in
fact
eligible
for
a
stay.
jurisdiction
over
the
appeal
on
other
words
must
be
determined
by
focusing
upon
the
category
of
order
appeal
from
rather
than
upon
the
strength
of
the
grounds
for
reversing
the
order.
even
a
request
utter
frivolousness
cannot
turn
a
denial
of
such
a
request
into
something
other
than
an
order
refusing
the
stay
of
any
action
under
section
3.
determining
whether
section
3
was
invoked
to
the
denied
stay
request
is
immeasurably
simpler
than
the
alternative
and
appellate
courts
have
ample
authority
to
minimize
the
impact
of
abusive
appeals.
we
also
hold
that
the
sixth
circuit
erred
in
finding
that
federal
law
bars
non-parties
to
a
contract
from
obtaining
a
section
3
stay.
