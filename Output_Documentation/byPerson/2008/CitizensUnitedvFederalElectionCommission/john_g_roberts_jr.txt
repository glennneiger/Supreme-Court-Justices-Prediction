chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
today
in
case
08-205,
citizens
united
v.
the
federal
election
commission.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
think
you
have
kind
of
shifted
your
focus
here
from
the
difference
between
a
10-second
ad
and
a
90-minute
presentation
and
how
that
presentation
is
received,
whether
it's
over
the
normal
airwaves
or
on
this
video
on
demand.
what
--
what
is
the
distinction
between
the
10-second
commercial
and,
say,
the
90-minute
infomercial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
this
argument
doesn't
depend
upon
whether
this
is
properly
characterized
as
express
--
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy?
your
contention
is
that
even
if
it
is,
that
because
it
wasn't
in
the
factual
record
in
mcconnell
or
before
congress,
it
is
a
type
of
functional
--
it
is
a
type
of
express
advocacy
that's
not
covered
by
the
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
why
i'm
trying
to
figure
out,
the
distinction
in
your
argument.
i
mean,
if
we
think
that
this
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy,
are
you
contending
that
it
is
nonetheless
not
covered
in
light
of
the
record
before
the
court
in
mcconnell
and
before
congress?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
because
it's
mandatory
appellate
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
it's
--
you
don't
have
a
choice.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
length
of
the
advertisements
wasn't
remotely
at
issue
in
either
washington
right
to
life
or
mcconnell
or
before
congress
when
they
passed
this
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
any
discussion
in
either
mcconnell
--
any
citation
either
in
mcconnell
or
the
congressional
record
to
those
types
of
documentaries?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
how
do
we
know
it
was
a
known
phenomenon
in
terms
of
the
evolution
of
the
statute
and
the
decision
of
this
court
upholding
it
if
there's
no
reference
to
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
if
wal-mart
airs
an
advertisement
that
says
we
have
candidate
action
figures
for
sale,
come
buy
them,
that
counts
as
an
electioneering
communication?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it
has
one
name,
one
use
of
the
candidate's
name,
it
would
be
covered,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it's
a
500-page
book,
and
at
the
end
it
says,
and
so
vote
for
x,
the
government
could
ban
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
talking
about
under
the
constitution,
what
we've
been
discussing,
if
it's
a
book.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
right.
forget
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
take
my
hypothetical.
it
doesn't
say
at
the
outset.
if
funds
--
here
is
--
whatever
it
is,
this
is
a
discussion
of
the
american
political
system,
and
at
the
end
it
says
vote
for
x.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
they
didn't,
you
could
ban
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
if
we
accept
your
constitutional
argument,
we're
establishing
a
precedent
that
you
yourself
say
would
extend
to
banning
the
book,
assuming
a
particular
person
pays
for
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
write
a
book,
to
pay
for
somebody
to
write
a
book?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
just
a
newsletter.
suppose
a
sign
held
up
in
lafayette
park
saying
vote
for
so
and
so.
under
your
theory
of
the
constitution,
the
prohibition
of
that
would
be
constitutional?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
again,
just
to
follow
up,
even
if
there's
one
clause
in
one
sentence
in
the
600-page
book
that
says,
in
light
of
the
history
of
the
labor
movement,
you
should
be
careful
about
candidates
like
john
doe
who
aren't
committed
to
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
does
by
its
terms,
doesn't
it?
published
within
60
days.
it
mentions
a
candidate
for
office.
what
other
qualification
is
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
that
type
of
case
was
never
presented
to
the
court
in
mcconnell
and
was
never
presented
to
congress
when
it
considered
bcra?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
before
you
run
out
here,
can
i
--
we
haven't
talked
about
the
disclosure
requirements
yet.
you
understand
the
test
to
be
that
disclosure
is
not
required
if
the
names
of
those
disclosed
--
if
those
people
would
be
reasonably
subject
to
reprisals?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
--
how
do
we
apply
that
test?
is
it
inconceivable
to
you
here
that
people
contributing
to
such
a
clearly
anti-clinton
advertisement
are
not
going
to
be
subject
to
reprisals?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
doesn't
work,
because
maybe
they
are
going
to
change
the
nature
of
the
documentaries
that
they
fund,
or
somebody
who
gave
a
contribution
5
years
ago
may
decide,
boy,
i
don't
like
what
they're
doing.
i'm
not
going
to
give
anymore.
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
fact
that
they've
disclosed
in
the
past
by
compulsion
of
law
doesn't
seem
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
they
are
going
to
be
subject
to
reprisals.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
seems
to
me
you're
saying
they've
got
to
wait
until
the
--
the
horse
is
out
of
the
barn.
you
can
only
prove
that
you
are
reasonably
subject
to
reprisals
once
you've
been
the
victim
of
reprisals.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
saying
--
that's
saying
that
the
test
in
mcconnell
is
unworkable,
if
you
say
the
alternative
is
to
say
they
are
categorically--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
the
boy
scouts
run
an
ad
and
they
have
--
they're
subject
to
disclosure,
are
the
donors
who
support
that
ad
reasonably
subject
to
reprisals?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
you
sit
down,
any
other?
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
olson,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
reargument
this
morning
in
case
08-205,
citizens
united
v.
the
federal
election
commission.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--counsel,
in
your
discussion
of
austin,
you
rely
on
its
inconsistency
with
bellotti.
bellotti,
of
course,
involved
a
referendum
and
austin
expenditures
in
an
individual
election.
why
isn't
that
a
significant
distinction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
that
we've
cleared
up
that
bellotti
didn't
decide
the
question,
what
is
the
distinction
that
--
why
don't
you
think
that
distinction
makes
sense?
in
other
words,
a
corporate
--
you
don't
have
a
potential
for
corruption
if
a
corporation
is
simply
speaking
on
a
referendum
that
may
directly
affect
its
interest.
if
you
are
dealing
with
a
candidate,
what
the
court
has
said
in
the
past
is
that
you
do
have
that
problem
of
corruption.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
why
isn't
that
distinction
a
way
to
reconcile
bellotti
and
austin?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
did
we
say
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
you
tell
us
now.
we
will
give
you
time
for
rebuttal.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
abrams.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
also
inconsistent
with
his
later
view,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
abrams.
general
kagan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
are
giving
up
--
you
are
giving
up
the
distinction
from
mcfl
that
you
defended
in
your
opening
brief?
there
you
said
this
doesn't
qualify
as
a
different
kind
of
corporation
because
it
takes
corporate
funds,
and
now
you
are
changing
that
position?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
guess
--
do
you
think
mcfl
applies
in
this
case
even
though
the
corporation
takes
corporate
funds
from
for-profit
corporations?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
--
do
you
think
it's
too
strict?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
want
to
give
up
this
case,
change
your
position,
and
basically
say
you
lose
solely
because
of
the
questioning
that
we
have
directed
on
reargument?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
of
the
question
we
have
posed
on
reargument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
case
of
ours
--
what
case
of
ours
suggests
that
there
is
a
hierarchy
of
bases
on
which
we
should
rule
against
a
party
when
both
of
them
involve
constitutional
questions?
extending
--
modifying
mcfl
would
be,
i
assume,
by
virtue
of
the
first
amendment.
overruling
austin
would
be
by
virtue
of
the
first
amendment.
so
what
case
says
we
should
prefer
one
as
opposed
to
the
other?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
understand
to
be
the
compelling
interest
that
the
court
articulated
in
austin?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
so
but
you
--
you
have
more
or
less
--
"abandoned"
is
too
strong
a
word,
but
as
you
say
you
have
relied
on
a
different
interest,
the
quid
pro
quo
corruption.
and
you
--
you
articulate
on
page
11
of
your
brief
--
you
recognize
that
this
court
has
not
accepted
that
interest
as
a
compelling
interest.
so
isn't
it
the
case
that
as
you
view
austin
it
is
kind
of
up
for
play
in
the
sense
that
you
would
ground
it
on
an
interest
that
the
court
has
never
recognized?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--where
in
your
--
where
in
your
supplemental
briefing
do
you
say
that
this
aggregation
of
wealth
interest
supports
austin?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
putting
it
outside,
putting
the
quid
pro
quo
interest
aside,
where
in
your
supplemental
briefing
do
you
support
the
interest
that
was
articulated
by
the
court
in
austin?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
that
to
be
a
different
interest.
that
is
the
shareholder
protection
interest
as
opposed
to
the
fact
that
corporations
have
such
wealth
and
they
--
they
distort
the
marketplace.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
am
i
right
then
in
saying
that
in
the
supplemental
briefing
you
do
not
rely
at
all
on
the
market
distortion
rationale
on
which
austin
relied;
not
the
shareholder
rationale,
not
the
quid
pro
quo
rationale,
the
market
distortion
issue.
these
corporations
have
a
lot
of
money.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
we
have
to
preserve
--
if
we
are
going
to
preserve
austin
we
have
to
accept
your
invitation
that
the
quid
pro
quo
interest
supports
the
holding
there
or
the
shareholder
protection
interest.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
not
--
i'm
sorry,
but
that
seems
rather
odd.
a
large
corporation
just
like
an
individual
has
many
diverse
interests.
a
corporation
may
want
to
support
a
particular
candidate,
but
they
may
be
concerned
just
as
you
say
about
what
their
shareholders
are
going
to
think
about
that.
they
may
be
concerned
that
the
shareholders
would
rather
they
spend
their
money
doing
something
else.
the
idea
that
corporations
are
different
than
individuals
in
that
respect,
i
just
don't
think
holds
up.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
a
candidate
--
take
a
tobacco
company,
and
a
candidate
is
running
on
the
platform
that
they
ought
to
make
tobacco
illegal,
presumably
that
company
would
maximize
its
shareholders'
interests
by
opposing
the
election
of
that
individual.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
some
do,
but
let's
say
if
you
have
ten
individuals
and
they
each
contribute
$1,000
to
a
corporation,
and
they
say,
"we
want
this
corporation
to
convey
a
particular
message.
"
why
can't
they
do
that,
when
if
they
did
that
as
partnership,
it
would
be
all
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
could
i
ask,
it
seems
--
to
your
shareholder
protection
rationale,
isn't
it
extraordinarily
paternalistic
for
the
government
to
take
the
position
that
shareholders
are
too
stupid
to
keep
track
of
what
their
corporations
are
doing
and
can't
sell
their
shares
or
object
in
the
corporate
context
if
they
don't
like
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
a
busy
job.
you
can't
expect
everybody
to
do
that.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
is
extraordinary
--
i
mean,
the
--
the
idea
and
as
i
understand
the
rationale,
we
--
we
the
government,
big
brother,
has
to
protect
shareholders
from
themselves.
they
might
give
money,
they
might
buy
shares
in
a
corporation
and
they
don't
know
that
the
corporation
is
taking
out
radio
ads.
the
government
has
to
keep
an
eye
on
their
interests.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
is
--
i
mean,
i
understand.
so
it
is
a
paternalistic
interest,
we
the
government
have
to
protect
you
naive
shareholders.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
investing
in
our
country's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
take
it
we
have
never
accepted
your
shareholder
protection
interest.
this
is
a
new
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
other
than
that,
and
i
think
there
may
be
some
ambiguity
there,
but
i
wouldn't
say
nrwc
is
a
holding
on
shareholder
protection.
so
to
the
extent
that
you
abandoned
the
original
rationale
in
austin,
and
articulated
different
rationales,
you
have
two,
the
quid
pro
quo
corruption
interest
and
the
shareholder
protection
interest--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--austin,
i
thought,
was
based
on
the
aggregation
of
immense
wealth
by
corporations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
you
--
can
you
give
me
the
citation
to
the
page
in
austin
where
we
accepted
the
shareholder
protection
rationale?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
the
words
"shareholder"
--
i
don't
know,
do
the
words
"shareholder
protection"
appear
in
the
austin
opinion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
they
don't
--
let's
assume
they
don't,
then
i
get
back
to
my
question,
which
is,
you
are
asking
us
to
defend
the
austin
or
support
or
continue
the
austin
opinion
on
the
basis
of
two
rationales
that
we
have
never
accepted,
shareholder
protection
and
quid
pro
quo
corruption?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
context
of
contributions,
not
expenditures.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
a
yes?
in
other
words,
you
are
asking
us
to
uphold
austin
on
the
basis
of
two
arguments,
two
principles,
two
compelling
interests
we
have
never
accepted,
in
expenditure
context.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
we
don't
put
our
--
we
don't
put
our
first
amendment
rights
in
the
hands
of
fec
bureaucrats;
and
if
you
say
that
you
are
not
going
to
apply
it
to
a
book,
what
about
a
pamphlet?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
cover
books.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
i'm
sorry,
we
suggested
some
in
the
last
argument.
you
have
a
history
of
union
organizing
and
union
involvement
in
politics,
and
the
last
sentence
says
in
light
of
all
this,
vote
for
jones.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john

one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
i'm
not
--
maybe
it's
professor
hayward,
if
i
am
getting
that
right
--
suggested
the
history
of
this
1947
provision
was
such
that
it
really
wasn't
enforced
because
people
were
concerned
about
the
first
amendment
interests
and
that
the
courts
to
the
extent
cases
were
brought
did
everything
they
could
to
avoid
enforcing
the
limitations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
mr.
waxman,
the
government
did
have
that
opportunity,
and
the
government
compiled
a
record.
and
when
the
citizens
united
abandoned
that
position
--
you
are
quite
right,
they
changed
their
course
--
the
government
and
the
district
court
complained
that
it
had
to
go
to
all
this
work
to
develop
this
record,
and
yet
we
hear
nothing
about
what
the
record
showed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.

olson

minutes.
chief
justice

g.

briefly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
08-205,
citizens
united
versus
the
fec,
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
of
the
court.
