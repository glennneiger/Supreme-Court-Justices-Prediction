justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
--
i
guess
what
--
what
justice
breyer
is
asking
is
--
i
have
the
same
question.
if
we
concede
--
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
might
not
concede
this,
but
if
we
take
this
as
a
beginning
point,
that
a
short,
30-second,
1-minute
campaign
ad
can
be
regulated,
you
want
me
to
write
an
opinion
and
say,
well,
if
it's
90
minutes,
then
that's
different.
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
make
the
argument
with
90
--
the
90
minutes
is
much
more
powerful
in
support
or
in
opposition
to
a
candidate.
that's
i
--
that's
the
thrust
of
the
questioning.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
it
were
an
advocacy
organization
that
had
a
book.
your
position
is
that
under
the
constitution,
the
advertising
for
this
book
or
the
sale
for
the
book
itself
could
be
prohibited
within
the
60/90-day
period
--
the
60/30-day
period?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
suppose
it
could
even
--
is
it
the
kindle
where
you
can
read
a
book?
i
take
it
that's
from
a
satellite.
so
the
existing
statute
would
probably
prohibit
that
under
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
to
make
it
clear,
it's
the
government's
position
that
under
the
statute,
if
this
kindle
device
where
you
can
read
a
book
which
is
campaign
advocacy,
within
the
60/30-day
period,
if
it
comes
from
a
satellite,
it's
under
--
it
can
be
prohibited
under
the
constitution
and
perhaps
under
this
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
--
in
this
case,
mr.
stewart,
i
take
it
--
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
that
you
think
the
distinction
the
petitioner
draws
between
the
90-minute
film
and
the
--
and
the
short
30-second
or
1-minute
ad
is
a
baseless
distinction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
--
if
we
think
that
the
application
of
this
to
a
90-minute
film
is
unconstitutional,
then
the
whole
statute
should
fall
under
your
view--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
there's
no
distinction
between
the
two?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
--
i'm
saying
that
if
we
--
if
we
think
that
this
is
--
that
this
film
is
protected,
and
you
say
there's
no
difference
between
the
film
and
the
ad,
then
the
whole
statute
must
be
declared
void.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
want
us
to
say
they're
both
the
same?
you
want
--
you
argue
that
they're
both
the
same.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
just
from
the
standpoint
of
art
and
literature,
that's
very
odd.
suppose
you
have
a
film
which
is
quite
moving
with
scenery
and
music
and
magnificent
acting,
and
a
subtle
message.
that
may
be
far
more
effective
in
advocating,
and
everyone
knows
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
everyone
knows
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
agree
--
i
agree
that
buckley
made
the
distinction
between
contributions
and
expenditures,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government's
argument
necessarily
wants
to
water
down
that
distinction.
but
in
response
or
just
in
furtherance
of
justice
breyer's
point,
you
have
two
cases,
one
in
which
an
officeholder
goes
to
a
corporation
and
says:
will
you
please
give
me
money?
they
say:
we
can't
do
that.
the
other
is
in
which
a
corporation
takes
out
an
ad
for
the
--
for
the
candidate,
which
relieves
that
candidate
of
the
responsibility
of
--
of
substantial
television
coverage.
isn't
that
about
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
--
and
i
think
buckley
says
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
as
a
practical
matter,
is
that
always
true?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
with
reference
to
any
incongruities
that
might
flow
from
our
adopting
your
position,
are
you
aware
of
any
case
in
this
court
which
says
that
we
must
refrain
from
addressing
an
unconstitutional
aspect
of
the
statute
because
the
statute
is
flawed
in
some
other
respects
as
well?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
judgment
was
validated
by
buckley's
contribution-expenditure
line.
and
you're
correct
if
you
look
at
contributions,
but
this
is
an
expenditure
case.
and
i
think
that
it
doesn't
clarify
the
situation
to
say
that
for
100
years
--
to
suggest
that
for
100
years
we
would
have
allowed
expenditure
limitations,
which
in
order
to
work
at
all
have
to
have
a
speaker-based
distinction,
exemption
from
media,
content-based
distinction,
time-based
distinction.
we've
never
allowed
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you
--
if
you
insist
on
the
as-applied
challenge,
isn't
that
inconsistent
with
the
whole
line
of
cases
that
began
in
thornhill
v.
alabama
and
coates
v.
cincinnati?
what
about
the
thornhill
doctrine?
it
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs,
but
that
doctrine
is
that
even
a
litigant
without
standing
to
object
to
a
particular
form
of
conduct
can
raise
that
if
the
statute
covers
it
in
order
that
the
statute
does
not
have
an
ongoing
chill
against
speech.
and
there
is
no
place
where
an
ongoing
chill
is
more
dangerous
than
in
the
elections
context.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
are
asking
us
to
have
an
ongoing
chill
where
we
have
as-applied
challenges
which
are
based
on,
as
i
indicated
before,
speaker,
content,
time,
and
this
is
the
kind
of
chilling
effect
that
the
thornhill
doctrine
stands
directly
against.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
that
we
were
to
rule
that
nonprofit
corporations
could
not
be
covered
by
the
statute.
would
that
--
would
the
statute
then
have
substantial
overbreadth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
we
were
to
say
that.
would
the
statute
then
not
be
substantially
overbroad?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
am
asking
you
to
assume
that
we
draw
the
nonprofit/profit
distinction.
then
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me,
clearly
has
to
fall
because,
number
one,
we
couldn't
sever
it
based
on
the
language.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
your
position,
if
corporations
a,
b,
and
c,
are
called
to
washington
every
monday
morning
by
a
high-ranking
administrative
official
or
a
high-ranking
member
of
the
congress
with
a
committee
chairmanship
and
told
to
tow
the
line
and
to
tell
their
directors
and
shareholders
what
the
policy
ought
to
be,
some
other
corporation
can't
object
to
that
during
the
election
cycle.
the
government
silences
a
corporate
objector,
and
those
corporations
may
have
the
most
knowledge
of
this
on
the
subject.
corporations
have
lots
of
knowledge
about
environment,
transportation
issues,
and
you
are
silencing
them
during
the
election.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
other
corporations,
via
--
because
of
the
very
fact
you
just
point
out,
have
already
been
used
and
are
being
used
by
the
government
to
express
its
views;
and
you
say
another
corporation
can't
object
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
course
of
this
argument,
have
you
covered
point
two?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
would
like
to
know
what
it
is,
so
that
i
--
my
notes
are
complete.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
to
undercut
buckley
in
so
doing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
he
was
talking
about
contributions
in
that
context.
that's
quite
clear.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
it's
been
on
--
it's
been
on
the
books
forever.
but,
no.
1,
the
phenomenon
of
--
of
television
ads
where
we
get
information
about
scientific
discovery
and
--
and
environment
and
transportation
issues
from
corporations
who
after
all
have
patents
because
they
know
something,
that
--
that
is
different.
and
the
--
the
history
you
applied
apply
to
contributions,
not
to
those
kinds
of
expenditures.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act,
which
is
known
is
bcra,
was
enacted
by
congress
in
2002,
and
bcra,
that
act
incorporates
a
prohibition
on
certain
political
contributions
and
expenditures
by
corporations.
that
prohibition
is
in
section
441b
of
the
act.
section
441b
prohibits
corporations
from
making
certain
independent
expenditures
to
support
candidates
for
federal
office.
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
act
prohibits
first;
independent
expenditures
for
speech
in
any
media
that
expressly
advocates
the
election
or
defeat
of
a
candidate
for
federal
office,
and
second;
the
act
also
prohibits
independent
expenditures
that
the
act
defines
as
"electioneering
communications"
and
an
election
commun
–
an
election
--
"electioneering
communication"
is
any
broadcast,
satellite
or
cable
communication
that
refers
to
a
clearly
identified
candidate
for
federal
office
and
one
that
is
made
within
either
30
days
of
a
primary
election
or
60
days
of
a
general
election.
this
court's
opinion
in
mcconnell
versus
federal
election
commission
upheld
section
441b
and
other
provisions
of
the
act
against
the
broad
facial
constitutional
challenge.
mcconnell
relied
upon
the
court's
earlier
decision
in
a
case
called
austin
versus
michigan
chamber
of
commerce.
now,
this
case
involves
a
corporation
that
planned
to
broadcast
the
film
in
the
year
2008,
which
was
a
presidential
election
year.
the
film
was
entitled
“hillary:
the
movie.”
the
film
was
a
commentary
on
the
career
and
background
of
then
senator
hillary
clinton
who
was
a
candidate
in
the
presidential
primaries.
the
corporation
that
made
the
movie
and
wanted
to
broadcast
it
is
the
appellant
in
this
case,
citizens
united.
citizens
united
was
concerned
that
the
broadcast
would
be
prohibited
by
the
act,
thus
making
the
corporation
and
its
responsible
officials
liable
for
criminal
and
civil
penalties.
so
the
corporation
sought
a
judicial
determination
that
would
allow
it
to
broadcast
the
film.
the
corporation
proposed
to
broadcast
the
film
by
video-on-demand,
that
would’ve
allowed
viewers
to
choose
the
film
and
then
watch
it
on
their
own
tv
sets
through
cable
television
and
citizens
united
proposed
to
make
the
movie
available
through
video-on-demand
free
of
charge.
relying
on
our
cases,
the
three-judge
district
court
rejected
citizens
united
constitutional
challenge
to
section
441b.
the
trial
court
ruled
that
it
would
be
unlawful
under
the
act
for
the
corporation
to
broadcast
or
promote
the
movie
during
the
30
and
60-day
periods.
the
case
came
before
us
on
appeal
and
it
was
argued
last
term.
this
court
ordered
reargument
to
address
whether
the
court
should
overrule
either
or
both
austin
and
that
part
of
mcconnell
which
addresses
the
facial
validity
of
section
441b
and
our
opinion
as
announced
in
this
session
today
pursuant
to
the
statute
that
directs
us
to
expedite
constitutional
challenges
to
bcra
and
the
disposition
of
those
challenges.
citizens
united
and
some
amici
have
made
various
arguments
to
the
effect
that
corporate
political
speech
prohibition
in
a
441b
would
be
invalid,
just
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
leaving
the
question
of
its
facial
validity
to
another
day.
there
is,
for
instance,
a
preliminary
argument
that
the
film
is
something
other
than
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy
for
or
against
the
candidate
so
that
the
film
should
be
exempt
from
the
statutory
ban
under
on
of
our
precedents,
federal
election
commission
versus
wisconsin
right
to
life.
we
reject
that
argument.
the
film
is
quite
critical
of
senator
clinton.
we
agree
with
the
trial
court
that
the
film
is
susceptible
of
no
other
interpretation
than
to
argue
to
the
public
that
she
lacked
qualifications
for
the
office.
example
of
other
as-applied
arguments
are
(1),
since
each
broadcast
would
go
to
a
single
household,
then
the
broadcast
would
not
meet
the
statutory
coverage
requirement
for
50,000
or
more
persons
and
(2),
another
alternative
argument
is
that
citizens
united
is
nonprofit
corporation
and
that
the
statute
could
be
safe
from
judicial
attack
by
interpreting
the
statute
or
really
judicially
rewriting
it,
so
it
does
not
include
nonprofit
corporations.
we
conclude
that
these
suggestions,
and
some
of
them
are
made
by
citizens
united
and
some
by
amici,
are
not
sustainable
under
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute.
in
addition
to
the
difficulties
in
interpreting
the
statutes
in
these
ways,
the
time,
expense
and
uncertainty
involved
in
case-by-case
determination
to
elaborate
as
applied
exceptions,
would
chill
political
speech.
so,
these
difficulties
requires
us
to
ask,
if
the
statutory
prohibition
applicable
to
corporate
political
speech
is
constitutional
as
a
general
matter.
austin
versus
michigan
chamber
of
commerce,
one
of
this
court's
cases,
upheld
the
ban
on
corporate
political
speech
and
as
already
noted,
the
mcconnell
decision
in
turn
relied
upon
austin.
we
conclude
that
those
precedents
now
must
be
reexamined.
the
court
has
recognized
that
first
amendment
protection
extends
to
corporations.
in
accord
with
this
principle,
a
pre-austin
line
of
cases
forbids
restrictions
on
political
speech
based
on
the
speaker's
corporate
identity.
austin
was
the
first
time
in
this
court's
history
that
a
ban
on
independent
expenditures
by
corporations
for
political
speech
was
upheld.
if
the
first
amendment
has
any
force,
it
prohibits
congress
from
fining
or
jailing
citizens
or
associations
of
citizens
for
simply
engaging
in
political
speech.
austin
in
its
rationale,
however,
would
allow
the
government
to
ban
corporations
from
expressing
political
views
through
any
media,
including
media
beyond
those
presented
here
and
in
this
case
such
as
by
printing
books.
political
speech
is
indispensable
to
decision
making
in
a
democracy
and
this
is
not
less
true
because
the
speech
comes
from
a
corporation
rather
than
an
individual.
austin's
rationale
would
produce
the
dangers
and
unacceptable
consequence
that
congress
could
ban
political
speech
of
media
corporations.
media
corporations
are
now
exempt
from
441b's
ban
on
political
speech,
but
they
amass
wealth
like
other
business
corporations,
so
under
austin
the
government
could
diminish
the
voice
of
a
media
business.
there
is
no
precedent
for
permitting
this
under
the
first
amendment.
austin
interferes
with
the
open
marketplace
of
ideas
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
austin
allows
the
government
to
ban
the
political
speech
of
millions
of
associations
of
citizens,
thereby
silencing
the
voices
that
may
best
represent
the
most
significant
segments
of
the
economy.
the
government
seeks
to
use
its
full
power,
including
the
criminal
law,
to
command
where
a
person
may
get
his
or
her
information
or
what
distrusted
source
he
or
she
may
not
hear,
it
uses
censorship
to
control
thought.
this
is
unlawful.
the
first
amendment
confirms
the
freedom
to
think
for
ourselves.
our
precedent
is
to
be
respected
unless
the
most
convincing
of
reasons
demonstrates
that
adherence
to
this,
puts
us
on
a
course
that
is
sure
error.
for
the
reasons
just
stated
and
others
explained
in
some
detail
in
the
court's
quite
lengthy
opinion,
we
now
overrule
austin.
austin
was
not
well
reasoned,
experience
has
undermined
it
and
no
serious
reliance
interests
are
at
stake.
we
return
to
the
principles
set
forth
in
our
pre-austin
line
of
cases
that
the
government
may
not
suppress
political
speech
on
the
basis
of
the
speaker's
corporate
identity.
without
austin
the
government
cannot
limit
corporate
expenditures,
corporate
independent
expenditures.
section
441b's
ban
on
corporate
independent
expenditures
is
therefore
invalid
and
it
could
not
be
applied
to
this
film.
given
our
conclusion
that
austin
must
be
and
is
overruled,
we
also
overrule
that
part
of
mcconnell
that
upheld
441b's
restrictions
on
corporate
independent
expenditures.
there's
a
second
aspect
of
this
case.
the
act
has
provisions
for
extensive
disclosure
and
in
addition
to
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
prohibition
on
the
broadcast
of
the
film,
citizens
united
argues
that
these
provisions
of
bcra
are
unconstitutional.
we
reject
citizens
united's
challenge
to
the
disclaimer
and
disclosure
provisions.
