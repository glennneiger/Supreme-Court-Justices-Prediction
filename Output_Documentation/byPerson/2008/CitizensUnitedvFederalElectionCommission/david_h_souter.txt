mr.
olson,
if
the
film
were
distributed
by
general
motors,
would
your
argument
be
the
same?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
--
the
point,
then,
of
similarity
is
you
would,
whether
it
was
offered
by
general
motors
or
offered
by
--
by
this
petitioner,
in
effect
call
for
some
qualification
of
the
--
the
general
rule
allowing
limitations
on
corporate
political
activity
of
--
of
the
speech
variety?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
how
would
we
draw
the
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
every
--
in
effect,
every
limitation
on
corporate
speech
or
on
corporate
expenditure
and
the
nature
of
speech
be
subject,
then,
to
in
effect
this
all-factor
balancing
test?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
--
so
your
--
your
argument
then
is
there's
something
distinct
about
the
speech,
which
could
be
considered
regardless
of
the
corporate
form?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
is
the
case,
what
is
--
what
is
the
answer
to
this?
that
--
that
still
is
going
to
involve
a
--
a
fairly
complicated
set
of
analyses,
probably
in
a
lot
of
cases.
why
is
that
necessary
or
worthwhile
to
preserve
first
amendment
values
when
you
could
have
done
this
with
a
pac?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
you've
got
reporting.
you've
got
limitations
on
--
on
corporate
contributions
and
so
on,
but
in
this
case,
for
example,
most
of
your
contributions,
as
i
understand
from
the
record,
were
individual.
they
weren't
corporate.
there
was
one
perhaps.
there
was
some
corporate
contribution--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
no
matter
how
many
boxes
we
have,
doesn't
this
one
fall
into
campaign
advocacy?
i
mean,
i've
got
the
government's
brief
open
at
--
open
at
pages
18
to
19
with
the
quotations:
she
will
lie
about
anything.
she's
deceitful.
she's
ruthless,
cunning,
dishonest,
do
anything
for
power,
will
speak
dishonestly,
reckless,
a
congenital
liar,
sorely
lacking
in
qualifications,
not
qualified
as
commander
in
chief.
i
mean,
this
sounds
to
me
like
campaign
advocacy.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
--
it
seems
to
me,
the
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question:
this
is
a
don't
vote
for
jones.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
you
--
as
you've
said
yourself,
as
you
pointed
out,
there
--
there
is
a
point
at
which
there
is
no
nonporous
border
between
issue
discussion
and
candidate
discussion.
but
i
think
the
--
the
problem
that
--
that
justice
ginsburg
is
having,
that
i'm
having,
and
others
is
that
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
with
the
quotations
we're
dealing
with
here
--
as
justice
breyer
said,
it's
not
a
musical
comedy.
i
think
we
--
we
have
no
choice,
really,
but
to
say
this
is
not
issue
advocacy;
this
is
express
advocacy
saying
don't
vote
for
this
person.
and
if
that
is
a
fair
characterization,
the
difference
between
90
minutes
and
1
minute,
either
for
statutory
purposes
or
constitutional
purposes,
is
a
distinction
that
i
just
cannot
follow.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
say
that
--
why
--
what
--
what
is
your
basis
for
saying
that
congress
is
--
is
less
concerned
with
90
minutes
of
don't
vote
for
clinton
than
it
was
with
60
seconds
of
don't
vote?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
are
the
characteristic
advertisement.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
that
is
the
paradigm
case.
i
agree
with
you.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
--
you
then
leap-frog
from
saying
--
from
saying
that
is
the
paradigm
case
to
saying
that
this
never
covers
anything
but
the
paradigm
case
when
the
only
distinction
is
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
to
point
out
how
far
your
argument
would
go,
what
if
a
labor
union
paid
an
author
to
write
a
book
advocating
the
election
of
a
or
the
defeat
of
b?
and
after
the
manuscript
was
prepared,
they
then
went
to
a
commercial
publisher,
and
they
go
to
random
house.
random
house
says,
yes,
we
will
publish
that.
can
the
--
can
the
distribution
of
that
be
in
effect
subject
to
the
electioneering
ban
because
of
the
initial
labor
union
investment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
does
it
--
does
it
come
within
electioneering
because
of
the
initial
subvention
to
the
author?
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
--
we're
talking
about
how
far
the
constitutional
ban
could
go,
and
we're
talking
about
books.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
book
was
then
taken
over
as
a
commercial
venture
by
random
house?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
prohibition
only
comes
when
we
get
to
the
electioneering
stage.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
for
the
--
for
the
labor
union
simply
to
--
to
hire
--
is
there
--
is
there
an
outright
violation
when
the
labor
union
--
i
guess
this
is
a
statutory
question:
is
there
an
outright
violation
when
the
labor
union
comes
up
with
the
original
subvention?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
they
would
not
be.
the
subvention
is
made,
the
manuscript
is
prepared,
random
house
then
publishes
it,
and
there
is
a
distribution
within
the
--
what
is
it
--
the
60-day
period.
is
the
--
is
the
original
subvention
(a)
enough
to
bring
it
within
the
prohibition
on
the
electioneering
communication,
and
(b)
is
that
constitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
--
you're
right.
i
stand
corrected.
if
the
statute
covered
that
as
well,
if
the
statute
covered
the
book
as
well.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would
be
enough
to
bring
it
in,
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
constitution?
