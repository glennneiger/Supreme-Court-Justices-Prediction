justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
olson,
are
you
giving
up
on
your
earlier
arguments
that
there
are
ways
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question
to
resolve
this
case?
i
know
that
we
asked
for
further
briefing
on
this
particular
issue
of
overturning
two
of
our
court's
precedents.
but
are
you
giving
up
on
your
earlier
arguments
that
there
are
statutory
interpretations
that
would
avoid
the
constitutional
question?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
olson,
my
difficulty
is
that
you
make
very
impassioned
arguments
about
why
this
is
a
bad
system
that
the
courts
have
developed
in
its
jurisprudence,
but
we
don't
have
any
record
developed
below.
you
make
a
lot
of
arguments
about
how
far
and
the
nature
of
corporations,
single
corporations,
single
stockholder
corporations,
et
cetera.
but
there
is
no
record
that
i
am
reviewing
that
actually
goes
into
the
very
question
that
you're
arguing
exists,
which
is
a
patchwork
of
regulatory
and
jurisprudential
guidelines
that
are
so
unclear.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
facial
challenge--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
going
back
to
the
question
of
stare
decisis,
the
one
thing
that
is
very
interesting
about
this
area
of
law
for
the
last
100
years
is
the
active
involvement
of
both
state
and
federal
legislatures
in
trying
to
find
that
balance
between
the
interest
of
protecting
in
their
views
how
the
electoral
process
should
proceed
and
the
interests
of
the
first
amendment.
and
so
my
question
to
you
is,
once
we
say
they
can't,
except
on
the
basis
of
a
compelling
government
interest
narrowly
tailored,
are
we
cutting
off
or
would
we
be
cutting
off
that
future
democratic
process?
because
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
the
courts
who
created
corporations
as
persons,
gave
birth
to
corporations
as
persons,
and
there
could
be
an
argument
made
that
that
was
the
court's
error
to
start
with,
not
austin
or
mcconnell,
but
the
fact
that
the
court
imbued
a
creature
of
state
law
with
human
characteristics.
but
we
can
go
back
to
the
very
basics
that
way,
but
wouldn't
we
be
doing
some
more
harm
than
good
by
a
broad
ruling
in
a
case
that
doesn't
involve
more
business
corporations
and
actually
doesn't
even
involve
the
traditional
nonprofit
organization?
it
involves
an
advocacy
corporation
that
has
a
very
particular
interest.
