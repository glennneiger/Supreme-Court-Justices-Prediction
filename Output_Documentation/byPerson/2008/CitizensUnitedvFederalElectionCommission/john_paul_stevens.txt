justice
john
paul
stevens
and
maybe
those
cases
presented
more
difficult
issues
than
this
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olson,
can
i
ask
this
--
this
question?
wisconsin
right
to
life
--
judge
randolph
thought
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
that
case
was
controlling
in
this
case.
do
you
think
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
that
case
correctly
stated
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
be
sure
because
you're
--
sometimes
i
don't
think
you're
quite
saying
that.
but
you
do
agree
that
that
opinion
is
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
accept
the
test
that
was
stated
in
his
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
do,
mr.
olson--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
olson
--
mr.
olson,
would
you
answer
justice
ginsburg's
question
yes
or
no?
can
the
--
leaving
aside
foreign
investors,
can
the
--
can
--
does
the
first
amendment
permit
any
distinction
between
corporate
speakers
and
individual
speakers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
asking
you
that.
i
meant
in
your
view
does
it
permit
that
distinction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
there
is
a
compelling
government
--
can
there
be
any
case
in
which
there
is
a
different
treatment
of
corporations
and
individuals
in
your
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
more
than
said
we
are
not
deciding.
it
said
they
are
entirely
different
situations.
you
read
that
long
footnote
which
has
been
cited
six
or
eight
times
by
our
later
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
has
been
repeated
--
that
footnote
has
been
repeatedly
cited
in
subsequent
cases,
most
of
which
were
unanimous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
did
discuss
it
precisely
in
that
footnote
and
it
said
it's
a
different
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
you
are
correct
to
say
the
court
said
there
was
no
distinction.
it
said
the
distinction
requires
the
use
of
magic
words.
and
that's
what
they
said
in
wisconsin
right
to
life,
too.
both
of
them
said
there
is
a
distinction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
difficult
to
draw
in
some
cases,
but
nobody
said
there
is
no
distinction
that
i
am
aware
of.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
point
wasn't
even
discussed
in
the
opinion,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olson--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
question
you
can
answer
on
rebuttal?
no
one
has
commented
on
the
national
rifle
association's
amicus
brief.
none
of
the
--
none
of
the
litigants
have.
that's
in
response
to
justice
sotomayor's
thought
that
there
are
narrow
ways
of
resolving
the
problem
before
us.
on
rebuttal,
will
you
tell
us
what
your
view
on
their
solution
to
this
problem
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
to
answer
my
question,
the
line
suggested
by
the
nra
is
the
line
identified
by
congress
in
the
snowe-jeffords
amendment
dealing
with
individual
financing
of
speech
which
would
separate
all
of
these
problems.
what
is
your
comment
on
that
possible
solution
to
the
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
much
later
than
1947.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
those
were
union
cases,
weren't
they,
rather
than
corporate
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
have
you
read
justice
rehnquist's
dissent
in
the
bellotti
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
read
justice
rehnquist's
dissent
in
the
bellotti
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
somewhat
inconsistent
with
what
you
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
go
to
your
second
point,
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify
one
part
of
the
first,
namely,
your
answer
to
the
question
i
proposed
to
mr.
olson,
namely,
why
isn't
the
snowe-jeffords
amendment,
which
was
picked
on
by
congress
itself,
an
--
and
which
is
argued
by
the
nra,
an
appropriate
answer
to
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i'm
sorry.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
you
--
i
don't
think
you
really
caught
what
i
suggested
because
you
treated
it
as
an
enlargement
of
the
mcfl
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
not
what
the
national
rifle
association
argues
or
what
snowe-jeffords
covers.
it
covers
ads
that
are
financed
exclusively
by
individuals
even
though
they
are
sponsored
by
a
corporation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct
and
treating
the
snowe-jeffords
amendment
as
being
the
correct
test.
and
nobody
has
explained
why
that
wouldn't
be
a
proper
solution,
not
nearly
as
drastic
as
--
as
being
argued
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--congress
also
said
if
you
strike
down
the
wellstone
amendment,
we
want
the
snowe
--
jeffords
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
shouldn't
we
follow
that
direction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
is
that
not
the
--
the
wisest
narrow
solution
of
the
problem
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
objects
to
--
responds
to
justice
kennedy's
problem
by
saying
that
the
problem
is
we
have
got
to
contribute
to
both
parties,
and
a
lot
of
them
do,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ultra
vires
would
take
care
of
about
90
percent
of
the
small
corporations
that
justice
scalia
is
talking
about.
they
can't
just
--
they
can't
even
give
money
to
charities
sometimes
because
of
ultra
vires.
giving
political
contributions
is
not
typical
for
corporate
activity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
fec
chooses
to
prosecute
only
those
who
do
not
--
who
do
not
rely
exclusively
on
individual
contributions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
i
want
to
see
he
gets
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
would
solve
it
for
the
advertising,
and
there
are
two
things.
there
is
the
long
hillary
document
and
the
advertisements.
it
would
cover
those.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
are
the
only
--
only
ones
that
clearly
violate
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
you
disagree
with
the
nra's
submission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
solved
the
problem
as
it
would
for
the
advertising,
would
it
be
an
appropriate
solution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
a
nightmare
that
congress
endorsed
in
the
snowe-jeffords
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
held
the
wellstone
amendment
literally
cannot
be
applied.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
unanimously
held
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
not
endorse
the
nra's
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
filed
a
separate
opinion
that
justice
ginsburg,
justice
breyer
and
justice
sotomayor
have
joined.
we
agree
with
part
iv
of
the
court's
opinion
upholding
the
reporting
and
disclosure
provisions
of
the
bipartisan
represent
--
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act
of
2002
or
bcra.
we
dissent
from
the
court's
decision
to
strike
the
down
a
key
part
of
that
statute,
section
203
and
to
overrule
both
austin
against
michigan
chamber
of
commerce
and
a
portion
of
mcconnell
against
the
fec.
as
one
of
the
joint
authors
of
the
opinion
in
mcconnell,
i
must
emphatically
disagree
with
today's
all
changing
decision.
when
justice
o'connor
and
i
were
working
on
our
opinion
in
that
case,
we
thought
that
two
important
propositions
of
law
were
so
well
settled
that
they
needed
no
special
defense.
the
first,
that
congress
may
place
special
restrictions
on
the
use
of
corporate
funds
in
election
campaigns,
had
been
generally
recognized
for
a
century
or
more.
in
the
second,
that
there
is
a
relevant
distinction
between
a
corporate
speech
about
general
issues
on
the
one
hand
and
corporate
speech
specifically
advocating
the
election
or
defeat
of
a
candidate
on
the
other,
was
not
only
established
by
our
earlier
cases
but
had
also
helped
shape
the
extensive
debates
in
congress
that
lead
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
when
we
responded
to
the
numerous
facial
chance
of
challenges
raged
--
raised
in
the
mcconnell
case,
we
had
in
front
of
us
a
record
that
concluded
detailed
findings
by
the
district
court
judges
along
with
literally
thousands
of
pages
of
evidence
from
both
the
district
court
record
and
the
proceedings
before
congress.
the
case
the
court
decides
today
is
very
different.
unlike
mcconnell,
this
appeal
did
not
come
to
us
as
a
facial
challenge.
the
plaintiff
did
not
dispute
either
of
the
propositions
of
law
that
i
have
identified
and
the
trial
court
did
not
take
any
evidence
or
make
any
findings
that
related
to
the
important
issues,
this
court
now
decides.
while
the
court
tells
us
that
we
are
asked
to
reconsider
austin
and
mcconnell,
it
would
be
far
more
accurate
for
them
to
say,
"we
have
asked
ourselves
to
reconsider
those
cases
and
to
do
so,
without
the
benefit
of
any
evidentiary
record
that
might
shed
light
on
the
issues
that
the
court
addresses."
while
our
written
dissent
is
extremely
long,
this
morning
i
shall
summarize
just
five
major
flaws
in
the
court's
opinion.
first,
the
court
repeatedly
declares
that
corporations
have
been
banned
from
enter
--
engaging
in
political
speech.
in
reality,
the
expenditure
limits
imposed
by
the
statute
are
much
narrower
than
the
court
acknowledges.
the
appellant
itself
provides
a
good
example.
citizens
united
is
a
wealthy
nonprofit
corporation
that
runs
a
political
action
committee
or
pac
with
millions
of
dollars
in
assets.
under
bcra,
it
could
have
used
those
assets
to
televise
and
provote
--
promote
“hillary:
the
movie,”
wherever
and
whenever
it
wanted
to.
it
also
could
have
spent
unlimited
suns
--
sums
to
broadcast
the
film
at
anytime
other
than
the
30
days
before
the
last
primary
election.
it
could
have
avoided
regulation
altogether
if
it
had
simply
declined
to
take
money
from
for-profit
corporations.
all
that
the
parties
dispute
is
whether
citizens
united
had
a
right
to
use
the
funds
in
its
general
treasury
instead
of
the
funds
in
its
pac
to
pay
for
tv
broadcast
during
a
30-day
period.
there
are
many
ways
in
which
that
question
could
have
been
answered
without
rewriting
the
law
relating
to
campaign
expenditures
by
for-profit
corporations
and
unions.
the
court's
second
error
is
its
assumption
that
the
first
amendment
absolutely
and
categorically
prohibits
any
regulation
of
speech
that
distinguishes
on
the
basis
of
a
speaker's
identity,
including
the
identity
as
a
corporation.
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
we
have
held
that
speech
can
be
regulated
differentially
on
account
of
the
speaker's
identity,
when
speaker
is
understood
in
categorical
and
un
--
inter
--
institutional
terms
and
when
the
distinctions
are
based
on
a
legitimate
governmental
interest.
the
government
routinely
places
special
restrictions
on
the
speech
rights
of
students,
prisoners,
members
of
the
armed
forces,
foreigners
and
its
own
employees.
the
court's
new
rule,
however,
would
have
accorded
the
propaganda
broadcast
to
our
troops
by
tokyo
rose
during
world
war
ii,
the
same
threshold
protection
as
a
speech
by
general
mcarthur.
more
perm
–
pertinently,
it
would
appear
to
afford
the
same
protection
to
multinational
corporations,
controlled
by
foreigners
as
to
individual
americans.
as
aristotle
recognized
in
the
poetic,
the
identity
and
the
insinuative
of
a
speaker
are
always
relevant
when
evaluating
his
speech
and
indeed
it
is
that
insight
that
motivates
the
disclaimer
and
disclosure
provisions
that
the
court
upholds
today.
the
court's
premise
is
particularly
misguided
when
it
is
the
identity
of
corporations
that
is
at
issue.
simply
put,
corporations
are
not
human
beings.
in
the
context
of
an
election
to
public
office,
the
distinction
between
corporate
and
human
speakers
is
significant.
corporations
cannot
vote
or
run
for
office
because
they
are
managed
and
controlled
by
nonresidents,
their
interest
may
conflict
in
fundamental
ways
with
the
interest
of
eligible
voters.
as
the
court
has
long
resembled
the
distinctive
legal
attributes
(ph)
of
corporations
create
distinctive
threats
to
the
electoral
process.
the
rule
announced
today
that
congress
must
treat
corporate
speakers
exactly
like
human
beings
in
the
political
realm
represents
a
radical
strength
--
a
radical
change
in
the
law.
the
court's
third
error
is
its
claim
that
austin
and
mcclain,
excuse
me,
austin
and
mcconnell
are
--
were
aberrations
on
our
first
amendment
tradition.
the
court
has
the
point
exactly
backwards.
at
the
founding,
americans
took
it
as
a
given
that
corporations
could
be
comprehensibly
regulated
in
the
service
of
the
public
welfare.
they
held
a
cautious
view
of
corporate
and
a
narrow
view
of
corporate
rights
in
a
conceptually
--
conceptualized
speech
in
individualist
terms.
even
if
we
thought
that
the
freedom
of
the
speech
was
intended
to
describe
any
entity
that
could
print
pamphlets
and
newspapers
is
doubtful
that
the
framers
believed
the
freedom
of
speech
would
extend
to
corporations
who
cannot
themselves
engage
in
speech
and
is
even
more
doubtful
that
when
they
ratified
the
first
amendment
they
thought
they
were
laying
down
a
principle
that
could
be
used
to
insulate
corporations
from
even
modest
restrictions
on
electioneering
pro
--
expenditures.
while
the
evidence
from
the
founding
is
rather
scarce,
more
recent
history
is
crystal
clear.
congress
has
im
--
has
placed
its
special
limitations
on
campaign
spending
by
corporations
ever
since
the
1907
when
it
responded
to
the
rhetoric
of
theodore
roosevelt
and
enacted
the
tillman
act.
it
had
specifically
limited
the
independent
expenditures
of
corporations
on
candidate
elections
ever
since
the
taft-hartley
act
of
1947.
many
states
have
had
similar
laws
on
the
books
for
a
comparable
period
of
time,
if
not
longer.
before
today,
no
court
opinion,
not
one
had
ever
questioned
the
validity
of
these
laws.
to
the
contrary,
as
justice
rehnquist
wrote
for
a
unanimous
court
in
1982,
we
have
consistently
rules
and
i
am
quoting
that,
"congress
careful
legislative
adjustment
of
the
federal
electoral
laws
in
--
in
a
cautious
advantage,
advanced
step-by-step
to
count
for
the
particular
legal
and
economic
attributes
of
corporations,
warrants
considerable
deference
and
that
it
reflects
a
permissible
assessment
of
the
dangers
imposed
by
those
entities
to
the
electoral
process."
we
have
unanimously
concluded
that
these
laws
and
again
i
am
quoting,
"reflect
a
permissible
assumption
of
the
dangers
inpro
--
imposed
by
corporations
to
the
electoral
process
and
we
have
accept
--
accepted
the
legislative
judgment
that
the
special
characteristics
of
the
corporate
structure
require
particularly
careful
regulation.
in
a
long
line
of
cases,
we
have
likewise
concluded
that
the
ability
to
form
political
action
committees
reflects
--
provides
corporations
with
a
constitutionally
sufficient
opportunity
to
finance
electioneering,
at
the
same
time
that
it
protects
the
interest
of
dissenting
shareholders.
nothing
has
changed
since
1920
that
justifies
a
reexamination
of
the
--
of
those
conclusions.
the
majority
rests
virtually
its
entire
doctrinal
argument
on
two
cases;
buckley
against
valeo
decided
in
1974
and
first
national
bank
of
boston
against
bellotti
decided
in
1988
--
1978.
in
1975,
the
cor
--
the
bar
on
corporate
contributions
and
expenditures
have
become
such
an
accepted
part
of
campaign
finance
regulation
that
when
a
large
number
of
corporations
challenged
virtually
every
aspect
of
the
1971
federal
campaign
act
in
buckley,
no
one
even
bothered
to
argue
that
the
bar
is
such
was
unconstitutional.
and
in
1970
when
the
court
decided
bellotti,
no
member
of
the
court
disagreed
with
the
express
statement
in
justice
powell's
majority
opinion
that
our
holding
on
corporations'
right
to
speak
on
issues
of
general
interest
implied
no
comparable
right
in
the
quite
different
context
of
candidate
elections.
in
light
of
this
history,
it
is
clear
that
austin
was
well
supported
by
our
earlier
cases.
the
only
novel
development
in
austin
were
the
sleeping
--
sweeping
attacks
on
the
state
of
michigan's
corporate
expenditure,
restriction
and
dissents
filed
by
justices
scalia
and
thomas.
those
dissents
planted
the
seeds
that
have
flowered
into
the
majority's
stunning
holding
today.
the
court's
fourth
error
is
its
assumption
that
there
is
only
one
governmental
interest
that
counts
in
the
area
of
campaign
finance,
so
called
quid
pro
quo
corruption
and
appearance
of
such
corruption.
in
my
judgment,
this
crabbed
approach
disregards
our
constitutional
history
in
the
functional
demands
of
a
democratic
society.
on
numerous
occasions,
we
have
recognized
congress'
legitimate
interest
in
preventing
the
money
that
is
spent
on
elections
from
exerting
undue
influence
on
an
officeholder's
judgment
and
creating
the
appearance
of
such
influence
beyond
this
sphere
of
quid
quo
pro
relationships.
corruption
can
take
many
forms,
but
as
justice
souter
has
explained
in
more
than
one
opinion,
the
difference
between
selling
a
vote
and
selling
access
as
a
matter
of
degree
not
kind,
and
selling
access
is
not
qualitatively
different
from
giving
special
preference
to
those
who
spent
money
on
one's
behalf.
corruption
operates
along
a
spectrum
and
the
majority's
apparent
belief
that
quid
pro
quo
arrangements
can
be
lately
be
demarcated
from
other
improper
influence,
does
not
accord
with
the
--
the
theory
or
reality
of
politics.
it
certainty
does
not
accord
with
the
record
congress
developed
in
passing
bcra,
a
record
that
contained
detailed
findings
about
the
corrupting
consequences
of
corporate
and
union
independent
expenditures
in
the
years
preceding
the
law's
passage
and
which
amply
supported
congress'
determination
that
the
basic
integrity
of
our
political
system
as
well
as
the
public's
faith
in
that
system
was
in
jeopardy.
if
there
were
strong
evidence
to
show
that
the
new
law
was
intended
or
would
serve
to
stifle
political
competition,
then
we
would
have
reason
to
be
skeptical
of
congress'
finding,
but
there
is
no
such
evidence
and
the
majority
opinion
never
even
mentions
the
issue.
congress
recognized
in
the
bcra
that
unregulated
corporate
spending
on
elections
can
create
threats
to
republican
government
that
are
far
more
severe
than
an
occasional
bribe.
the
majority's
fifth
error
is
its
assumption
that
enlightened
self-government
can
arise
only
in
the
absence
of
regulations
such
as
section
203.
yet
while
the
court's
opinion
is
full
of
stirring
tributes
to
the
virtues
of
free
speech,
the
majority
fails
to
look
closely
at
or
in
fact
to
consider
at
all,
the
distinctive
attributes
of
corporate
expenditures
that
dramatically
changed
the
first
amendment
equations.
because
corporations
are
not
natural
persons,
restrictions
on
their
electioneering
pose
a
lesser
threat
to
the
interest
of
speakers.
corporate
speech
is
a
derivative
speech,
speech
by
proxy.
when
a
business
corporation
places
an
ad
endorsing
or
attacking
a
particular
candidate,
it
is
not
even
clear
who
is
speaking,
given
that
the
corporation
is
organized
with
the
goal
of
maximizing
shareholder
value
and
must
engage
the
electoral
process
with
that
goal
in
mind.
indeed
the
mcconnell
records
shows
that
many
corporations
routinely
gave
money
to
both
candidates
in
political
campaigns.
taking
away
the
ability
of
a
corporation
to
use
its
general
treasury's
funds
for
some
of
those
ads
and
no
one's
autonomy,
dignity
or
political
quality
has
been
impinged
upon
in
the
least.
so
on
the
--
a
speaker's
side
of
the
equation,
corporate
expenditures
are
obviously
and
profoundly
different
from
individual
expenditures.
the
majority
brushes
past
this
point
and
declares
that
section
203
offends
the
interest
of
listeners
by
reducing
the
total
amount
of
speech.
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
the
majority
ignores
that
in
numerous
respects,
corporate
electioneering
has
a
potential
to
distort
public
debate
in
ways
that
undermine
rather
than
advance
the
interest
of
its
listeners.
unregulated
corporate
electioneering
can
drown
out
the
voices
of
real
people.
it
can
decrease
listener's
eyes
--
exposure
to
relevant
view
points.
it
can
generate
cynicism
and
disenchantment.
in
can
chill
out
the
speech
of
those
who
hold
office
and
it
decrease
the
willingness
and
capacity
of
citizens
to
participate
in
self-government.
at
the
least,
a
democratically
elected
legislature
is
entitled
to
credit
these
serious
and
well
recon
--
recognized
concerns.
the
court's
first
amendment
analysis
is
based
on
the
metaphor
of
an
open
parket
--
marketplace
of
ideas,
but
the
court
never
actually
engages
with
the
reality
of
how
that
marketplace
operates
or
indeed
with
virtually
any
practical
concerns,
whatever.
the
court's
decision
is
at
war
with
the
views
of
generations
of
americans
who
have
worked
to
improve
our
campaign
spends
--
campaign
finance
system
and
thus
to
safeguard
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process
with
the
views
of
many
of
the
state
legislatures
that
over
many
decades
have
enacted
laws
similar
to
the
michigan
statute
we
upheld
in
austin
with
the
views
of
the
congress
that
enacted
the
tillman
in
1907,
the
congress
that
enacted
the
(inaudible)
--
taft-hartley
act
in
1947,
the
congress
that
have
acted
the
federal
electorate
campaign
act
in
1971
and
the
congress
that
enacted
the
bipartisan
campaign
reform
act
of
2002
too
and
with
the
views
and
expressed
by
the
overwhelmed
majority
of
justices
who
served
on
this
court.
the
majority's
rejection
of
the
long
standing
consents
--
consensus
on
the
need
to
limit
corporate
spending
--
spend
--
corporate
campaign
spending.
in
the
words
justice
white
once
used,
elevates
corporations
to
eleven
of
--
level
of
deference
which
has
not
been
seen
at
least
since
the
days
when
substantive
due
process
was
regularly
used
to
invalidate
regular
--
regulatory
legislation
thought
to
unfairly
impinge
upon
established
economic
interests.
at
bottom,
the
court's
opinion
is
just
a
rejec--
rejection
of
the
common
sense
of
the
american
people
as
expressed
in
1907
in
the
senate
report
on
the
tillman
act
which
observed
that
the
evils
of
the
use
of
corporate
money
in
connection
within
political
elections
are
so
generally
recognized
that
the
committee
be
--
deems
it
unnecessary
to
make
any
(inaudible)
in
favor
of
the
general
purpose
of
this
measure.
what
was
common
sates
--
sense
in
1907
remains
common
sense
for
--
common
sense
today.
while
american
democracy
is
still
imperfect,
few
outside
the
majority
of
this
court
would
have
thought
its
flaws
included
a
shortage
of
corporate
money
in
politics.
