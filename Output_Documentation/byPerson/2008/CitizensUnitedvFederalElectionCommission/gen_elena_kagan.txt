ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
three
very
quick
points
to
make
about
the
government
position.
the
first
is
that
this
issue
has
a
long
history.
for
over
100
years
congress
has
made
a
judgment
that
corporations
must
be
subject
to
special
rules
when
they
participate
in
elections
and
this
court
has
never
questioned
that
judgment.
number
two--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--i
will
repeat
what
i
said,
justice
scalia:
for
100
years
this
court,
faced
with
many
opportunities
to
do
so,
left
standing
the
legislation
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case
--
first
the
contribution
limits,
then
the
expenditure
limits
that
came
in
by
way
of
taft-hartley
--
and
then
of
course
in
austin
specifically
approved
those
limits.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
well,
you
are
not
a
self-starting
institution.
but
many
litigants
brought
many
cases
to
you
in
1907
and
onwards
and
in
each
case
this
court
turns
down,
declined
the
opportunity,
to
invalidate
or
otherwise
interfere
with
this
legislation.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
well,
i
think
justice
stevens
was
right
in
saying
that
the
expenditure
limits
that
are
in
play
in
this
case
came
into
effect
in
1947,
so
it
has
been
60
years
rather
than
100
years.
but
in
fact,
even
before
that
the
contribution
limits
were
thought
to
include
independent
expenditures,
and
as
soon
as
congress
saw
independent
expenditures
going
on
congress
closed
what
it
perceived
to
be
a
loophole.
so
in
fact
for
100
years
corporations
have
made
neither
contributions
nor
expenditures,
save
for
a
brief
period
of
time
in
the
middle
1940's,
which
congress
very
swiftly
reacted
to
by
passing
the
taft-hartley
act.
now,
the
reason
that
congress
has
enacted
these
special
rules
--
and
this
is
the
second
point
that
i
wanted
to
make--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--that
was
my
third
point,
justice
stevens.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
so
we
will
just
skip
over
the
second.
my
third
point
is
that
this
is
an
anomalous
case
in
part
because
this
is
an
atypical
plaintiff.
and
the
reason
this
is
an
atypical
plaintiff
is
because
this
plaintiff
is
an
ideological
nonprofit
and--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--no,
i
--
i
don't
think
we
are
changing
it.
mcfl
is
the
law,
and
the
fea
--
fec
has
always
tried
to
implement
mcfl
faithfully.
and
that's
what
the
fec
has
tried
to
do.
but
if
you--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--i
don't
think
mcfl
as
written
applies
in
this
case,
but
i
think
that
the
court
could,
as
lower
courts
have
done,
adjust
mcfl
potentially
to
make
it
apply
in
this
case,
although
i
think
that
would
require
a
remand.
what
lower
courts
have
done
--
mcfl
was
set
up,
it
was
written
in
a
very
strict
kind
of
way
so
that
the
organization
had
to
have
a
policy
of
accepting
no
corporate
funds
whatsoever.
some
of
the
lower
courts,
including
the
d.c.
circuit,
which,
of
course,
sees
a
lot
of
these
cases,
have
suggested
that
mcfl
is
too
strict,
that
it
doesn't--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--i
--
i
--
the
fec
has
no
objection
to
mcfl
being
adjusted
in
order
to
--
to
give
it
some
flexibility.
what
the--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--solely
because?
i
am
sorry?
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
no,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
fair.
we
think
--
we
continue
to
think
that
the
--
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
if
you
are
asking
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
to
whether
the
government
has
a
preference
as
to
the
way
in
which
it
loses,
if
it
has
to
lose,
the
answer
is
yes.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
i
think
the
question
really
is
the
court's
standard
practice
of
deciding
as-applied
challenges
before
facial
challenges.
and
this
case
certainly
raises
a
number
of
tricky
as-applied
questions.
one
is
the
question
of
how
the
--
the
statute
applies
to
nonprofit
organizations
such
as
this
one.
another
is
a
question
of
how
it
applies
to
vod
transmissions.
yet
another
is
the
question
of
how
it
applies
to
a
90-minute
infomercial
as
opposed
to
smaller
advertisements.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
well,
i
think
even--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--you
know,
i
think
even
in
the
first
amendment
context,
justice
kennedy,
the
court
will
not
strike
down
a
statute
on
its
face
unless
it
finds
very
substantial
overbreadth,
many
applications
of
the
statute
that
are
unconstitutional,
as
opposed
to
just
a
few
or
just
some.
what
i
am
suggesting
here
is
that
the
court
was
right
in
mcconnell
and
then
confirmed
in
wrtl
to
find
that
bcra,
which
is
of
course
the
only
statute
directly
involved
in
this
case,
did
not
have
that
substantial
overdraft.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
well,
i
would
urge
you
not
to
do
that
in
that
kind
of
sweeping
way,
because
the
reason
for
the
nonprofit
corporations
being
covered
is
to
make
sure
that
the
nonprofit
corporations
don't
function
as
conduits
for
the
for-profit
corporations.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
statute
is
substantially
overbroad
right
now.
so
if
you
took
out
certain
applications,
i
can't
think--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--i
see
what
you
are
saying.
well,
you
could
do
a
couple
of
things.
you
could
do
what
justice
stevens
suggested.
justice
stevens
suggested
--
i
suggested
to
chief
justice
roberts--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--i
was
going
to
go
back.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
yes,
that's
exactly
right.
what
you
are
suggesting,
justice
stevens,
is
essentially
stripping
the
wellstone
amendment
from
the--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--yes,
and
there
are
some,
you
know
--
there
are
--
there
are
some
reasons
that
that
might
--
that
might
be
appropriate.
the
wellstone
amendment
was
a
funny
kind
of
thing.
it
was
passed
very
narrowly,
but
beyond
that
it
was
passed
with
a
--
a
really
substantial
support
of
many
people
who
voted
against
the
legislation
in
the
end,
presumably
as
a
poison
pill.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
if
you
strike
down
the
wellstone
amendment,
what
is
left
is
the
snowe-jeffords
amendment--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--which
allows
nonprofit
organizations
of
the
kind
here
to
fund
these
ads
out
of
separate
bank
accounts,
not
pacs
just
separate
bank
accounts--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--which
include
only
individual
expenditures.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
well,
it
is
--
it
is
certainly
a
narrower
and
i
think
better
solution
than
a
facial
invalidation
of
the
whole
statute.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
i
think
that
what
the
court
articulated
in
austin
--
and,
of
course,
in
the
government
briefs
we
have
suggested
that
austin
did
not
articulate
what
we
believe
to
be
the
strongest
compelling
interest,
which
is
the
anticorruption
interest.
but
what
the
court
articulated
in
austin
was
essentially
a
concern
about
corporations
using
the
corporate
form
to
appropriate
other
people's
money
for
expressive
purposes.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
well,
a
couple
of
points.
the
first
thing
is,
as
you
say,
we
have
not
abandoned
austin.
we
have
simply
said
that
in
addition--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--to
other
people's
money
interest
that--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--i
would
not
really
call
it
an
aggregation
of
wealth
interest.
i
would
say
that
it's
--
it's
a
concern
about
corporate
use
of
other
people's
money
to--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--where
we
talk
about
shareholder
protection
and
where
we
talk
about
the
distortion
of
the
electoral
process
that
occurs
when
corporations
use
their
shareholders'
money
who
may
or
may
not
agree--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--well,
i
--
i
think
that
they
are
connected
because
both
come--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--we
do
not
rely
at
all
on
austin
to
the
extent
that
anybody
takes
austin
to
be
suggesting
anything
about
the
equalization
of
a
speech
market.
so
i
know
that
that's
the
way
that
many
people
understand
the
distortion
rationale
of
austin,
and
if
that's
the
way
the
court
understands
i,
we
do
not
rely
at
all
on
that.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
i
would
say
either
the
quid
pro
quo
interest,
the
corruption
interest
or
the
shareholder
interest,
or
what
i
would
say
is
a
--
is
something
related
to
the
shareholder
interest
that
is
in
truth
my
view
of
austin,
which
is
a
view
that
when
corporations
use
other
people's
money
to
electioneer,
that
is
a
harm
not
just
to
the
shareholders
themselves
but
a
sort
of
a
broader
harm
to
the
public
that
comes
from
distortion
of
the
electioneering
that
is
done
by
corporations.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
you
know,
i
think
that
the
single
shareholders
can
present
these
corruption
problems.
many,
many
closed
corporations,
single
shareholder
corporations--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--you
are
quite
right,
justice
scalia,
when
--
we
say
when
it
comes
to
single
shareholders,
the
kind
of
"other
people's
money"
interests,
the
shareholder
protection
interests
do
not
apply.
there--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--there--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--there
the
strongest
justification
is
the
anticorruption
interest.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
i
think
the
experience
of
some
half
the
states
cannot
be
more
important
than
the
100-year
old
judgment
of
congress
that
these
expenditures
would
corrupt
the
federal
system,
and
i
think
that--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--i
think,
justice
scalia,
it's
wrong.
in
fact,
corporate
and
union
money
go
overwhelmingly
to
incumbents.
this
may
be
the
single
most
self-denying
thing
that
congress
has
ever
done.
if
you
look
--
if
you
look
at
the
last
election
cycle
and
look
at
corporate
pac
money
and
ask
where
it
goes,
it
goes
ten
times
more
to
incumbents
than
to
challengers,
and
in
the
prior
election
cycle
even
more
than
that.
and
for
an
obvious
reason,
because
when
corporations
play
in
the
political
process,
they
want
winners,
they
want
people
who
will
produce
outcomes
for
them,
and
they
know
that
the
way
to
get
those
outcomes,
the
way
to
get
those
winners
is
to
invest
in
incumbents,
and
so
that's
what
they
do.
as
i
said,
in
double
digits
times
more
than
they
invest
in
challengers.
so
i
think
that
that
--
that
that
rationale,
which
is
undoubtedly
true
in
many
contexts,
simply
is
not
the
case
with
respect
to
this
case.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
well--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--well,
to
the
extent,
justice
kennedy,
that
you
are
talking
about
what
goes
on
in
the
halls
of
congress,
of
course
corporations
can
lobby
members
of
congress
in
the
same
way
that
they
could
before
this
legislation.
what
this
legislation
is
designed
to
do,
because
of
its
anticorruption
interest,
is
to
make
sure
that
that
lobbying
is
just
persuasion
and
it's
not
coercion.
but
in
addition
to
that,
of
course
corporations
have
many
opportunities
to
speak
outside
the
halls
of
congress.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
a
lot
of
them
do,
which
is
a
suggestion
about
how
corporations
engage
the
political
process
and
how
corporations
are
different
from
individuals
in
this
respect.
you
know,
an
individual
can
be
the
wealthiest
person
in
the
world
but
few
of
us
--
maybe
some
--
but
few
of
us
are
only
our
economic
interests.
we
have
beliefs,
we
have
convictions;
we
have
likes
and
dislikes.
corporations
engage
the
political
process
in
an
entirely
different
way
and
this
is
what
makes
them
so
much
more
damaging.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
well,
all
i
was
suggesting,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
corporations
have
actually
a
fiduciary
obligation
to
their
shareholders
to
increase
value.
that's
their
single
purpose,
their
goal.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
but
everything
is
geared
through
the
corporation's
self-interest
in
order
to
maximize
profits,
in
order
to
maximize
revenue,
in
order
to
maximize
value.
individuals
are
more
complicated
than
that.
so
that
when
corporations
engage
the
political
process,
they
do
it
with
that
set
of
you
know,
blinders
--
i
don't
mean
it
to
be
pejorative,
because
that's
what
we
want
corporations
to
do,
is
to--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--well,
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
the
corporation
that
you
were
describing
is
a
corporation
of
the
kind
we
have
in
this
case,
where
one
can
assume
that
the
members
all
sign
on
to
the
corporation's
ideological
mission,
where
the
corporation
in
fact
has
an
ideological
mission.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
well--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--to
the
extent
that
we
are
only
talking
about
single
shareholder
corporations,
i
guess
i
would
ask
why
it's
any
burden
on
that
single
shareholder
to
make
the
expenditures
to
participate
in
the
political
person
in
the
way
that
person
wants
to
outside
the
corporate
forum?
so
single
shareholders
aren't
suffering
any
burden
here;
they
can
do
everything
that
they
could
within
the
corporate
form,
outside
the
corporate
form.
they
probably
don't
get
the
tax
breaks
that
they
would
get
inside
the
corporate
form,
but
i'm
not
sure
anything
else
is
very
different.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
yes,
that's--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--yes,
that's
exactly
right,
justice
breyer,
that
in
addition
to
the
100-year
old
judgment
that
congress
believes
this
is
necessary,
that
very
recently
members
of
congress
and
others
created
a
gigantic
record
showing
that
there
was
corruption
and
that
there
was
the
appearance
of
corruption.
and
in
that
record,
many
times
senators,
former
senators
talk
about
the
way
in
which
fundraising
is
at
the
front
of
their
mind
in
everything
that
they
do
the
way
in
which
they
grant
access,
the
way
in
which
they
grant
influence,
and
the
way
in
which
outcomes
likely
change
as
a
result
of
that
fundraising.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
mean,
i,
for
one,
can't
keep
stack
of
what
my
--
where
i
hold--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--it's
not
that
--
it's
not
that
i
have
a
busy
job.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
i
appreciate
that.
it's
not
that
i
have
a
busy
job,
it's
that
i,
like
most
americans,
own
shares
through
mutual
funds.
if
you
don't
know
where
your
mutual
funds
are
investing,
so
you
don't
know
where
you
are--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--in
a
world
in
which
most
people
own
stock
through
mutual
funds,
in
a
world
where
people
own
stock
through
retirement
plans
in
which
they
have
to
invest,
they
have
no
choice,
i
think
it's
very
difficult
for
individual
shareholders
to
be
able
to
monitor
what
each
company
they
own
assets
in
is
doing
or
even
to
know
the
extent
of
the--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
ginsburg.
in
the
union
context,
of
course,
it's
a
constitutional
right
that
the
unions
give
back
essentially
the
funds
that
any
union
member
or
employee
in
the
workplace
does
not
want
used
for
electoral
purposes.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
you
are
right
about
that.
but
i
--
the
government
believes
that
with
respect
to
unions,
the
anticorruption
interest
is
as
strong,
and
that
unions
should
be
kept
in.
i
think
what
your
point
suggests,
that
the
--
that
the
union
member
point
suggests
why
congress
might
have
thought
that
there
was
a
compelling
interest
to
protect
corporate
shareholders
in
the
same
way
that,
let's
say,
dissenting
union
members
are
protected
by
the
constitution.
there
is
no
state
action,
of
course,
so
there
is
no
constitutional
right
in
the
corporate
context.
but
congress
made
a
judgment
that
it
was
an
important
value
that
shareholders
have
this
choice,
have
the
ability
both
to
invest
in
our
country's
assets
and
also
to
be
able
to
choose
our
country's
leaders.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
i
very
much
appreciate--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--i
very
appreciate
that,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
i
did
cover
point
two,
which
was
an
explanation
of
some
of
the
questions
that
the
chief
justice
asked
me
about
what
interests
the
government
was
suggesting
motivated
these
laws
and
are
compelling
enough
such
that
this
court
certainly
should
not
invalidate
these
laws.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
i
think
that
that's
fair.
certainly
bellotti
does
not
accept
it.
i
would
think
--
you
know,
national
right
to
work
is
an
interesting
opinion,
because
national
right
to
work
accepts
for
a
unanimous
court
both
the
shareholder
protection
argument
and
the
anticorruption
argument
with
respect
to
the
section
441b
in
particular.
now,
in
later
cases
the
court
has
suggested
that
national
right
to
work
was
only
focused
on
contributions.
if
you
read
national
right
to
work,
that
distinction
really
does
not
--
it's
not
evident
on
the
face
of
the
opinion,
and
i
think
chief
justice
rehnquist
at
later
--
in
a
later
dissent
suggested
that
he
had
never
understood
it
that
way.
but
--
so
national
right
to
work
is
a
confusion
on
this
point.
it--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--which
we
think
is
not
in
austin.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
again,
austin
is
not
the
most
lucid
opinion.
but
the
way
we
understand
austin,
what
austin
was
suggesting
was
that
the
corporate
form
gave
corporations
significant
assets,
other
people's
money
that
when
the
corporations
spent
those
assets--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--i
think
it
comes
when
the
--
when
the
court
is
distinguishing
mcfl.
and
the
message
of
that
distinction
of
mcfl
is
the
shareholder
protection
interest?
but--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--i
honestly
don't
know,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
--
and
i
don't
want
to--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--i
would
say
on
the
quid
pro
quo
corruption,
of
course
you
have
accepted
that
rationale--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--that's
correct.
and
i
think
what
has
changed
since
--
since
that
time
is
the
bcra
record
that
justice
breyer
suggested,
which
was
very
strong
on
the
notion
that
there
was
no
difference
when
it
came
to
corporate
contributions
and
expenditures,
that
there
actually
was
no
difference
between
the
two.
that
they--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--in
this
--
in
this
particular
context,
fair
enough.
but,
you
know,
i
think--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
do
think
buckley
was
about
individuals
rather
than
corporations,
and
buckley
was
in
1976,
not
in
2009,
after
the
very
extensive
record
that
was
created
in
bcra.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i
don't--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--the
government's
answer
has
changed,
justice
ginsburg.
[laughter]
it
is
still
true
that
bcra
203,
which
is
the
only
statute
involved
in
this
case,
does
not
apply
to
books
or
anything
other
than
broadcast;
441b
does,
on
its
face,
apply
to
other
media.
and
we
took
what
the
court
--
what
the
court's
--
the
court's
own
reaction
to
some
of
those
other
hypotheticals
very
seriously.
we
went
back,
we
considered
the
matter
carefully,
and
the
government's
view
is
that
although
441b
does
cover
full-length
books,
that
there
would
be
quite
good
as-applied
challenge
to
any
attempt
to
apply
441b
in
that
context.
and
i
should
say
that
the
fec
has
never
applied
441b
in
that
context.
so
for
60
years
a
book
has
never
been
at
issue.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
substantially
overbroad,
justice
scalia,
if
i
tell
you
that
the
fec
has
never
applied
this
statute
to
a
book.
to
say
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
books
is
to
take
off,
you
know,
essentially
nothing.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
i
think
a
--
a
pamphlet
would
be
different.
a
pamphlet
is
pretty
classic
electioneering,
so
there
is
no
attempt
to
say
that
441
b
only
applies
to
video
and
not
to
print.
it
does--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--well,
none
of
those
things,
again,
are
covered.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
yes,
i
think
what
you
--
what
we're
saying
is
that
there
has
never
been
an
enforcement
action
for
books.
nobody
has
ever
suggested
--
nobody
in
congress,
nobody
in
the
administrative
apparatus
has
ever
suggested
that
books
pose
any
kind
of
corruption
problem,
so
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
good
as-applied
challenge
with
respect
to
that.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
no,
no,
that's
exactly
right.
the
only
statute
that
is
involved
in
this
case
does
not
cover
books.
so
441b
which--
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
--which
does
cover
books,
except
that
i
have
just
said
that
there
would
be
a
good
as-applied
challenge
and
that
there
has
been
no
administrative
practice
of
ever
applying
it
to
the
books.
and
also
only
applies
to
express
advocacy,
right?
203
has
--
is
--
is
--
has
a
broader
category
of
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy,
but
441b
is
only
express
advocacy,
which
is
a
part
of
the
reason
why
it
has
never
applied
to
a
book.
one
cannot
imagine
very
many
books
that
would
meet
the
definition
of
express
advocacy
as
this
court
has
expressed
that.
ms.
gen.
elena
kagan
i
think
that
that
wouldn't
be
covered,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
fec
is
very
careful
and
says
this
in
all
its
regulations
to
view
matters
as
a
whole.
and
as
a
whole
that
book
would
not
count
as
express
advocacy.
