mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
case
cited
to
you
by
mr.
olson
happened
to
be
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
and
i
would
like
to
begin
by
urging
two
propositions
on
you
from
that
case.
in
that
case
the
court
was
confronted
with
a
situation
where
the
times
made
three
arguments
to
the
court.
they
said
--
for
us
to
win,
they
said,
you
either
have
to
revise,
basically
federalize,
libel
law
to
a
considerable
degree,
which
they
did;
or,
they
said,
we
only
sold
390
copies
in
alabama,
so
you
could
rule
in
our
favor
by
saying
there
was
no
jurisdiction;
or,
they
said,
we
didn't
even
mention
sheriff
sullivan's
name,
so
you
could
rule
in
our
favor
on
the
ground
that
they
haven't
proved
a
libel
case.
the
court
did
the
first.
it
did
the
first,
which
is
the
broader
rather
than
the
narrowest
way
to
address
the
question,
and
i
suspect
they
did
it
--
don't
know,
but
i
suspect
they
did
it
--
because
they
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
degree
of
first
amendment
danger
by
the
sort
of
lawsuits
which
were
occurring
in
alabama
and
elsewhere
was
something
that
had
to
be
faced
up
to
by
the
court
now,
or--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that's
true,
your
honor.
it
did
involve
overruling
150
years
of
american
jurisprudence.
i
mean,
there
was
no
law
at
that
point
that
said
that
actual
malice--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
and
what
i'm
urging
on
you,
your
honor,
is
that
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
although
not
precisely
the
same
situation,
that
there
are
cases
in
which
there
is
a
--
an
ongoing
threat
to
freedom
of
expression
which
may
lead
--
if
you
were
to
agree
to
that,
which
may
lead
the
court
to
say,
rather
than
taking
a
narrower
route
to
the
same
result,
that
it
is
worth
our
moving
away
in
this
case
from
looking
for
the
narrowest
way
out,
and
determining
it
now,
rather
than
the
next
as-applied
challenge.
mr.
floyd
abrams
and
stare
decisis
of
course
is
a
question
much
--
much
briefed
by
the
parties,
and
it
is
one
which
involves
of
course
a
consideration
not
only
of
the
merits
of
the
decision,
but
certain
other
factors,
the
length
of
time
the
decision
has
been
in
effect
and
the
like.
the
time
in
this
case
for
the
mcconnell
case,
of
course,
is
only
6
years.
the
time
for
the
austin
case
is
19
years,
which
is
less
than
one
ruling
of
this
court's
just
last
term.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
austin
was
the
first
time
that
corporate
speech
was
barred
--
corporate
independent
expenditures
were
barred
by
a
ruling
of
this
court.
that
had
not
happened
prior
to
austin,
and
the
solicitor
general's
brief
acknowledges
that.
now--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--there
had
been
limits
on
corporate
contributions
since
the
turn
of
the
century.
corporate
independent
expenditures
came
much
later
and
i
think
that
is
something
that
i
think
is
worth--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
your
honor.
in
1947,
president
truman
vetoed
that
bill,
saying
that
it
was
a
dangerous
intrusion
into
free
speech.
that
has
always
been
an
area
of
enormous
controversy,
not
just
in
the
public
sphere
but
in
the
judicial
sphere.
the
early
cases
about
taft-hartley
were
ones
in
which
what
the
court
did
was
to
basically
say
in
one
case
after
another
that
the
statute
did
not
govern
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
so
as
to
avoid--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
they
were
three
union
cases.
and
the
case
after
that
essentially
was
buckley.
and
buckley
held
unconstitutional
the
limits
posed
there
to
independent
expenditures.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
this
is
not
a
situation
as
if
we
have
an
unbroken
amount
of
years
throughout
american
history
in
which
it
has
been
accepted
that
independent
expenditures
could
be
barred.
it
has
always
been
a
matter
of
high
level
of
controversy,
with
courts
at
first
and
understandably
shying
away
from
facing
up
to
the
issue
directly
and
then
the
first
ruling
on
point.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
i
have.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
it
is.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
yes,
justice?
mr.
floyd
abrams
your
honor,
i
don't
think
you'd
be
doing
more
harm
than
good
in
vindicating
the
first
amendment
rights
here,
which
transcend
that
of
citizens
united.
i
think
that,
reading
my
friend's
brief
here
on
the
right,
they
come
--
some
of
them
at
least
come
pretty
close
to
saying
that
there
must
be
a
way
for
citizens
united
to
win
this
case
other
than
a
broad
way.
in
my
view
the
principles
at
stake
here
are
the
same.
citizens
united
happens
to
be
sort
of
the
paradigmatic
example
of
the
sort
of
group
speaking
no
less
about
who
to
vote
for
or
not
who
to
vote
for
or
what
to
think
about
a
potential
ongoing
candidate
for
president
of
the
united
states.
but
in
lots
of
other
situations
day
by
day
there
is
a
blotch
to
public
discourse
caused
as
a
result
of
this
congressional
legislation.
and
so
we
think
it
is
not
a
matter
of
cutting
off
what
legislatures
can
do.
they
can
still
pass
legislation
doing
all
sorts
of
things.
they
can
do
public
funding.
they
can
do
many
other
things
that
don't
violate
the
first
amendment.
if
we
are
right
in
saying
that
independent
expenditures,
that
category
of
money
leading
to
speech
that
we
are
talking
about
today,
if
we
are
right
that
that
is
the
sort
of
speech
which
is
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment,
then
you
would
be
doing
only
good,
only
good,
by
ruling
that
way
today
across
the
board.
thank
you,
your
honor.
