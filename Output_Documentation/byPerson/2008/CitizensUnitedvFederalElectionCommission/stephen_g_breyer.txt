justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
answered
justice
souter.
i
took
your
answer
to
be
the
following:
that
if
the
corporation
had
paid
--
paid
for
a
program
and
the
program
was
90
minutes
which
said
vote
for
smith,
vote
for
smith
over
and
over
--
that's
the
program
--
that
you
concede
that
the
government
could
ban
this
under
the
act.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
they
would.
we
agree.
it's
an
imaginary
hypothetical.
but,
in
fact,
if
they
did
have
90
minutes
of
vote
for
smith
or
vote
against
jones,
you
concede
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
the
government
can
ban
it.
is
that
bright
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
okay.
so
one
of
your
arguments
is
this
is
a
special
corporation.
you
can't.
now
suppose
it's
general
motors.
can
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
just
like
to
get
--
i
want
to
get
an
answer
to
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now
then,
my
question
that
i'm
driving
towards
is:
since
general
motors
can
in
your
view
be
forbidden
to
have
our
film
of
90
minutes
vote
for
smith,
vote
for
smith,
vote
for
smith,
or
vote
against
jones,
vote
against
jones,
vote
against
jones,
how
is
this
film,
which
i
saw
--
it
is
not
a
musical
comedy.
what
----
[laughter]
what
--
how
does
this
film
vary
from
my
example,
and
why
does
the
variance
make
a
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
get
the
answer
to
what
i
was
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
that
isn't
--
that
isn't
the
suggestion.
the
suggestion
i
was
going
to,
or
trying
to
get
to,
is
we
know
you
can't
just
say
vote
against
smith,
vote
against
smith,
vote
against
smith.
now,
i
wanted
to
know
the
difference
between
that
and
a
film
that
picks
out
bad
things
that
people
did
--
no
good
ones,
just
bad
ones
the
candidate
did.
and
then
we
have
another
film
that
picks
out
just
good
things
candidates
do.
and
so
candidates
run
films
that
show
the
good
things
they
do,
and
then
someone
else
shows
the
bad
things
they
do.
now,
why
is
that
not
the
same
as
vote
against
smith?
though
i
grant
you,
it's
more
intelligent.
it's
more
informative.
it's
even
better
electioneering.
so
we're
after
electioneering.
why
doesn't
that
fall
within
the
forbidden
category?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
i
guess
it's
the
same
as
if
you
were
to
say,
you
know,
i
think
smith
is
a
great
guy.
that's
all.
i'm
sharing
information.
and
what
i
don't
see
is
if
you
agree
that
we
could
ban
the
commercial
that
says,
i
see
smith
is
a
great
guy,
why
is
it
any
different
to
supplement
that
with
the
five
best
things
that
smith
ever
did?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wonder
if
that's
--
i
mean,
i
take
it
the
answer
to
the
question,
can
the
government
ban
labor
unions
from
saying
we
love
this
person,
the
corporations,
we
love
them,
the
environmentalists
saying
we
love
them,
is
of
course
the
government
can't
ban
that.
the
only
question
is,
who's
paying
for
it.
and
they
can
make
a
determination
of
how
much
money
the
payors
can
pay,
but
you
can't
ban
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
correct,
then
i
take
it
the
interesting
question
here
would
be
--
i
don't
know
if
it
arises
in
this
case.
suppose
there
were
a
kind
of
campaign
literature
or
--
or
advocacy
that
either
a
corporation
had
to
pay
for
it,
it
couldn't
pay
for
it
through
the
pac
because
for
some
reason
--
i
don't
know
--
the
pac
--
and
there's
no
other
way
of
getting
it
to
the
public.
that
would
raise
a
constitutional
question,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
present
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
about
that.
but
i
guess
i
would
be
worried
if
in
fact
there
was
some
material
that
couldn't
get
through
to
the
public.
i
would
be
very
worried.
but
i
don't
think
i
have
to
worry
about
that
in
this
case,
do
i?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
agree
with
you
about
that,
but
i
thought
what
saves
this
--
many
people
thought
it
doesn't
save
it,
it's
--
the
whole
thing's
unconstitutional,
the
whole
act.
that
isn't
what
i
thought.
so
what
saves
this
is
of
course
you
can't
prohibit
all
those
things.
what
you
do
is
put
limitations
on
the
payment
for
them,
see
that
there
are
other
ways
of
paying
for
it,
say,
through
pacs,
and
then
limit
very
carefully
the
media
that
are
affected
and
the
times
for
which
they
are
affected.
now,
that's
the
statute
before
us,
and
it's
i
think
you
have
to
address.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
individual
contribution
also
covers
people
who
would
like
to
give
$2500
instead
of
$2400,
which
is
the
limit.
and
maybe
there
are
100
million
or
200
million
people
in
the
united
states
who,
if
they
gave
2500
rather
than
2400,
nobody
could
say
that
that
was
really
an
effort
to
buy
the
senator
or
the
congressman.
so
is
that
unconstitutional,
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
here
the
obvious
argument
is:
look,
they
said
the
compelling
interest
is
that
people
think
that
representatives
are
being
bought,
okay?
that's
to
put
it
in
a
caricature,
but
you
understand
what
i'm
driving
at,
okay?
that's
what
they
said
in
buckley
v.
valeo.
so
congress
now
says
precisely
that
interest
leads
us
to
want
to
limit
the
expenditures
that
corporations
can
make
on
electioneering
communication
in
the
last
30
days
of
a
primary,
over-the-air
television,
but
not
on
radio,
not
on
books,
not
on
pamphlets,
not
on
anything
else.
all
right?
so
in
what
respect
is
there
not
conceptually
at
least
a
compelling
interest
and
narrow
tailoring?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
important--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
of
course,
it
did
--
was
a
basis
for
prohibiting
speech
by,
in
the
sense
of
giving
contributions
above
$2,400,
by
300
million
people
in
the
united
states.
but
the
point,
which
i
think
is
the
one
that
justice
kennedy
was
picking
up,
is
are
we
arguing
here
between
you
and
my
questions,
is
the
argument
in
this
case
about
the
existence
of
a
compelling
interest?
because
congress
seemed
to
think
that
there
was
certainly
that;
it's
this
concern
about
the
perception
that
people
are,
say,
buying
candidates.
are
we
arguing
about
narrow
tailoring?
congress
thought
it
was
narrow
tailoring.
or
are
we
arguing
about
whether
we
should
second-guess
congress
on
whether
there
is
enough
of
a
compelling
interest
and
the
tailoring
is
narrow
enough?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that
is
so
--
this
is
a
point
that
is
concerning
me.
i
don't
know
the
answer
precisely.
but
suppose
you
are
right.
suppose
we
overrule
these
two
cases.
would
that
leave
the
country
in
a
situation
where
corporations
and
trade
unions
can
spend
as
much
as
they
want
in
the
last
30
days
on
television
ads,
et
cetera,
of
this
kind,
but
political
parties
couldn't,
because
political
parties
can
only
spend
hard
money
on
this
kind
of
expenditure?
and
therefore,
the
group
that
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
building
a
platform
that
will
appeal
to
a
majority
of
americans
is
limited,
but
the
groups
that
have
particular
interests,
like
corporations
or
trade
unions,
can
spend
as
much
as
they
want?
am
i
right
about
the
consequence?
if
i
am
right,
what
do
we
do
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
--
i
am
saying
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
if
you
win,
the
political
party
can't
spend
this
money,
it's
limited
to
hard
money
contributions,
but
corporations
and
trade
unions
can
spend
unlimited
funds?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i
am
suggesting
we
will
make
a
hash
of
this
statute,
and
if
we
are
going
to
make
a
hash
of
this
statute,
what
do
we
do
about
it?
and
that's
why
i
want
you
to
take
a
position
on
another
important
part
of
that
statute,
and
that
is
the
part
that
says
political
parties
themselves
cannot
make
these
expenditures
that
we
are
talking
about
except
out
of
hard
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
we
--
if
we
go
--
if
we
go
that
route,
what
we
are
doing
is
creating
an
accounting
industry,
aren't
we?
corporations
give
huge
amounts
of
money
to
the
c-4
organization,
and
then
somebody,
perhaps
the
fec,
has
to
decide
whether
in
fact
that
is
a
way
of
subverting
the
prohibition
against
the
direct
payment
for
the
communication,
right?
okay,
so
congress
said,
we
don't
want
that.
congress
said,
that's
going
to
be
a
nightmare,
and
we
decide
wellstone,
for
whatever
reasons.
now
don't
we
have
to
focus
on
whether
congress
can
say
that
or
whether
it
can't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
don't
know
why
it
cannot
say
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
--
i
--
i
remember
spending
quite
a
few
days
one
summer
reading
through
1,000
pages
of
opinion
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
and
i
came
away
with
the
distinct
impression
that
congress
has
built
an
enormous
record
of
support
for
this
bill
in
the
evidence.
and
my
recollection
is,
but
it
is
now
a
couple
of
years
old,
that
there
was
a
lot
of
information
in
that
which
suggested
that
many
millions
of
voters
think,
at
the
least,
that
large
corporate
and
union
expenditures
or
contributions
in
favor
of
a
candidate
lead
the
benefited
political
figure
to
decide
quite
specifically
in
favor
of
the
--
of
the
contributing
or
expending
organization,
the
corporation
or
the
union.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that,
i
think,
that
this
court
upheld
the
law
in
bcra.
but
we
have
heard
from
the
other
side
there
isn't
much
of
a
record
on
this.
so,
if
you
could
save
me
some
time
here,
perhaps
you
could
point
me,
if
i
am
right,
to
those
thousand
pages
of
opinion
and
tens
of
thousands
of
underlying
bits
of
evidence
where
there
might
be
support
for
that
proposition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
bcra
has
changed
all
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
actually
i
read
that
sentence
that
you
just
read
as
meaning
the
corporation
is
an
artificial
person
in
respect
to
which
the
state
creates
many
abilities
and
capacities,
and
the
state
is
free
also
to
create
some
disabilities
and
capacities.
not
a
statement
about
balancing
rich
and
poor.
