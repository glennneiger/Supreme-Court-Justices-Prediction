mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
participation
in
the
political
process
is
the
first
amendment's
most
fundamental
guarantee.
yet
that
freedom
is
being
smothered
by
one
of
the
most
complicated,
expensive,
and
incomprehensible
regulatory
regimes
ever
invented
by
the
administrative
state.
in
the
case
that
you
consider
today,
it
is
a
felony
for
a
small,
nonprofit
corporation
to
offer
interested
viewers
a
90-minute
political
documentary
about
a
candidate
for
the
nation's
highest
office
that
general
electric,
national
public
radio,
or
george
soros
may
freely
broadcast.
its
film
may
be
shown
in
theaters,
sold
on
dvds,
transmitted
for
downloading
on
the
internet,
and
its
message
may
be
distributed
in
the
form
of
a
book.
but
its
producers
face
5
years
in
prison
if
they
offer
it
in
the
home
through
the
vehicle
of
video
on
demand.
because
the
limitation
on
speech,
political
speech,
is
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment,
the
government
has
a
heavy
burden
to
establish
each
application
of
a
restriction
on
that
form
of
speech
is
a
narrowly
tailored
response
to
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
the
government
cannot
prove
and
has
not
attempted
to
prove
that
a
90-minute
documentary
made
available
to
people
who
choose
affirmatively
to
receive
it,
to
opt
in,
by
an
ideologically
oriented
small
corporation
poses
any
threat
of
quid
pro
quo
corruption
or
its
appearance.
indeed,
this
documentary
is
the
very
definition
of
robust,
uninhibited
debate
about
a
subject
of
intense
political
interest
that
the
first
amendment
is
there
to
guarantee.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
wouldn't
--
definitely
would
not
be
the
same
because
there
are
several
aspects
of
the
argument
that
we
present.
however,
in
one
respect,
it
would.
a
90-minute
documentary
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
the
--
the
bcra
--
that
the
congress
was
intended
to
prohibit.
in
fact,
as
the
--
as
the
reporters
committee
for
--
for
freedom
of
speech
points
out,
the
documentary
is
objectively
indistinguishable
from
other
news
media
commentary--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
we
would,
although
it
is
a
very
important
factor.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
one
of
the
reasons
that
--
one
of
the
bases
upon
which
you
would
draw
the
line
is
to
look
at
the
documentary
--
the
voluminous
documentary
record
that
the
government
cites
and
this
court
cited
in
the
mcconnell
case
as
a
justification
for
the
restrictions
themselves.
as--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
what
the
--
what
the
congress
was
concerned
with
--
and
judge
kollar-kotelly
in
the
district
court
opinion
that
you
considered
in
mcconnell
discusses
this
on
page
646
of
her
opinion
--
that
this
sort
of
communication
was
not
something
that
congress
intended
to
prohibit.
you
would
look
at,
if
congress
intended
to
prohibit
90
minutes--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that's
part
of
our
argument,
yes.
it's
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
as
this
court
said
in
the
wisconsin
right
to
life
case
just
a
couple
years
ago,
that
the
pac
vehicle
is
burdensome
and
difficult--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
on
page
252
of
the
appendix
and
251,
it
points
out
--
you're
absolutely
correct
--
that
1
percent
of
the
contributions--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--were
from
corporations.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
government
sent
an
interrogatory,
justice
ginsburg,
asking
for
the
major
contributions
with
respect
to
this
project,
and
the
ones
that
they
sought
--
the
government
sought
what
they
thought
was
important;
the
answer
to
that
interrogatory
is
at
page
251a
and
252a
--
that
the
government
was
seeking
information
with
respect
to
contributions
at
a
$1,000
or
more;
198,000
came
from
individuals.
and,
by
the
way,
the
three
largest
contributors
that
are
listed
on
page
252
of
the
joint
appendix
are
given
credit
in
the
film
itself.
so
there's
no
effort
to
--
to
conceal
those
individuals.
so
that
it
is
possible
--
it's
possible
that
corporations
throughout
america
were
giving
small
amounts
of
money
to
this.
that
record
doesn't
establish
one
way
or
the
other.
what
it
does
establish
is
what
the
government
felt
was
necessary
for
its
case
that
the
major
contributors
were
individuals
and
not
corporations.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it's
--
it
is
difficult--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
--
not
by
this
organization.
we
think
that
if
it's
a
small,
nonprofit
organization,
which
is
very
much
like
the
massachusetts--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
general
motors
may
be
smaller
than
the
client
that
we
are
representing.
[laughter]
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
i
think--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
to
the
extent
that
it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
difference
is:
it's
exactly
what
the
court
was
describing
in
wisconsin
right
to
life.
it
is
a
90
--
it
is
--
it
informs
and
educates,
which
is
what
the
court
said,
or
the
chief
justice's
opinion,
the
controlling
opinion
said,
was
the
mark
of
an
issue
communication.
and
as
this
court
said--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
the
--
what
the
court
said
in
wisconsin
right
to
life
was
that
the
distinction
between
an
issue
--
issue
advocacy
and
campaign
advocacy
dissolves
upon
practical
application.
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
was
talking
about
there.
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
it
did,
justice
ginsburg,
but
what
my
point
is:
that
there
isn't
just
two
boxes
in
the
world
of
communications
about
public
issues,
one
box
for
so-called
issues
and
one
box
for
campaign
advocacy.
that's
what
i
think
the
court
meant
when
it
said,
not
just
in
wisconsin
right
to
life
but
in
earlier
cases,
that
the
distinction
dissolves
upon
application.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
--
what
--
what
the
court
was
talking
about
and
as
justice
kollar-kotelly
talked
about
is
broadcast
advertising,
these
10-minute
--
10-second,
30-second,
60-second
bursts
of
communication
that
are
--
that
are
the
influence
in
elections.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
this
is
a
long
discussion
of
the
record,
qualifications,
history,
and
conduct
of
someone
who
is
in
the
political
arena,
a
person
who
already
holds
public
office,
who
now
holds
a
different
public
office,
who,
yes,
at
that
point,
justice
souter,
was
running
for
office.
but
the
fact
is
that
what
could
the
individual
making
a
--
as
i
said,
the
reporters
committee
for
the
right
to
life
said
this
is
indistinguishable
from
something
that
is
on
the
public
media
every
day,
a
long
discussion.
it
might
be
--
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
unless
it's
somehow
evenhanded,
unless
it
somehow
says
--
which
would
be
viewpoint
discrimination
or
prevention
of
viewpoints,
which
is
the
safe
harbor
that
the
government
has
written
into
its
so-called
safe
harbor,
if
you
don't
have
a
point
of
view,
you
can
go
ahead
and
express
it.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
government
has
the
burden
to
prove
--
there's
a
compelling
governmental
interest
narrowly
tailored,
justice
breyer,
because
all
kinds
of
things
of
the
type
that
you're
talking
about
are
permissible
if
your
name
is
general
motors
--
i,
mean
if
your
name
is
general
electric
rather
than
general
motors,
if
your
name
is
disney,
if
your
name
is
george
soros,
if
your
name
is
national
public
radio.
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
a
long
discussion
of
facts,
record,
history,
interviews,
documentation,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
if
it's
all
negative,
it
can
be
prohibited
by
--
and
it's
a
felony.
you
can
go
to
jail
for
5
years
for
sharing
that
information
with
the
american
public,
or
if
it's
all
favorable,
you
can
go
to
jail.
but
if
you
did
half
and
half,
you
couldn't.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because
--
because
of
the
first
amendment.
congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech.
when
--
when
the
government
--
when
this
court
has
permitted
that
to
happen,
it
has
only
done
it
in
the
most
narrow
circumstances
for
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
understand
that,
justice
kennedy,
and
it
is
difficult.
but
let
me
say
that
the
record
that
you
were
considering
in
mcconnell
--
and
i
specifically
invite,
as
i
did
before,
page
--
the
court's
attention
to
646
of
this
--
of
the
district
court's
opinion,
which
specifically
said
the
government
and
congress
was
concerned
about
these
short,
punchy
ads
that
you
have
no
choice
about
seeing,
and
not
concerned
about
a
thorough
recitation
of
facts
or
things
that
you
would
have
to
make
an
affirmative
decision
to
opt
into.
and
the
reason
why
it's
difficult
is
that
we
are
talking
about
an
infinite
variety
of
ability
of
people
to
speak
about
things
that
matter
more
to
them
than
anything
else,
who
will
be--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
thing
--
i
think
it's
--
it's
pointed
out
specifically
in
your
opinion,
controlling
opinion,
for
wisconsin
right
to
life.
that
which
informs
and
educates
and
may
seek
to
persuade
is
something
that
is
--
is
on
the
line
of
being
permissible.
the
government
hasn't
established
--
never
did
try
to
establish
--
i
did
shift
--
i
didn't
shift
but
all
of
these
are
factors.
it's
who's
doing
the
speaking--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
point,
i
think--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
point,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
is,
yes,
you
can
educate
in
10
seconds,
you
can
educate
in
30
seconds.
but
what
--
what
the
court
was
trying
to
do
--
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
is
get
at
the
things
that
were
most
potentially
corruptive.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
government
makes
the
point
that
it
established
a
voluminous
record
of
evidence.
both
congress
had
before
it
and
this
court
had
before
it
a
voluminous
volume
of
evidence
because
it
had
the
burden
of
proving
that
something
was
really
bad
with
these
--
these
types
of
advertisements.
and
what
the
--
what
the
court
did
is
say,
well,
okay
--
in
mcconnell
--
yes,
there
is
a
substantial
burden
that
the
government
met
that
these
types
of
communications
--
not
the
internet,
not
books,
not
other
types
of
things
--
are
really
bad
enough
that
the
government
could
pick
those
out,
and
it
has
narrowly
tailored
its
solution
to
that
problem
by
prohibiting
those
things.
and
the
government
talks
about
this
today
in
its
brief,
the
things
that
congress
felt
were
the
most
acute
problems.
now--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i'm
making
a--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
i
am
making
a
statutory
argument
in
the
sense
that
you
will
construe
the
statute
in
the
way
that
doesn't
violate
the
constitution.
the
constitution,
as
--
as
the
court
said
in
wisconsin
right
to
life,
gives
--
ties
to
the
speaker,
errs
on
the
side
of
permitting
the
speech,
not
prohibiting
the
speech.
and
so
all
of
those
things
may
be
statutory
arguments,
justice
scalia,
but
they
are
also
constitutional
arguments.
and
in
response
to
every
one
of
these
questions,
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
this
sort
of
speech,
which
the
reporters
say
is
indistinguishable
--
they're
the
kind
of
information
that
news
media
puts
out
all
the
time,
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
think,
chief
justice
roberts,
that
it
is
remotely
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy,
because
what
the
court
and
congress
was
thinking
about
with
respect
to
express
advocacy
was
short,
punchy
things
that
you
have
no--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
--
i
think
i
would
agree
with
that,
but
i
would
also
say
that
the
--
the
idea
of
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy
is
a
very
magic
word
problem
that
this
court
has
struggled
with
in
mcconnell
and
in
--
in
each
of
the
cases.
i
would
--
i
said
at
the
beginning
that
this
is
an
incomprehensible
prohibition,
and
i
--
and
my
--
i
think
that's
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
since
2003
this
court
has
issued
something
close
to
500
pages
of
opinions
interpreting
and
trying
to
apply
the
first
amendment
to
federal
election
law.
and
i
counted
22
separate
opinions
from
the
justices
of
this
court
attempting
to
--
in
just
the
last
6
years,
attempting
to
figure
out
what
this
statute
means,
how
it
can
be
interpreted.
in
fact--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
would
be
fewer
--
there
would
be
fewer
opinions.
i
guess
my
point
is
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
this
presents
a
much
easier
issue,
justice
stevens,
because
this
is
the
type
of
--
if
there
is
anything
that
the
first
amendment
is
intended
to
protect
in
the
context
of
elections
that
are
occurring
--
which,
by
the
way,
occur
4
years
running,
but
the
last
election,
presidential
election,
occurred
throughout
the
entire
2008
--
if
the
american
people
need
to
have
that
kind
of
information.
and
the
statute
is
both
overly
broad
because
if
it
was
a
hotel
ad,
if
it
was
a
hotel
saying
senator
clinton
stayed
here
or
senator
mccain
stayed
here,
it
would
be
prohibited
because
it
was
a
hotel
saying
so,
even
though
it
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
election.
if
it
is
--
but
it's
--
if
it's
a
corporation
that
put
together
an
analysis
of
the
earmark
positions
of
each
of
the
senatorial
candidates
--
most
all
of
the
candidates
were
running
from
the
senate,
they
all
had
this
--
these
issues
where
they
may
have
voted
or
not
against
earmarks,
that
would
be--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
i
understand
your
point.
there
is
much
in
there
that
if
you
saw
it,
you
would
form
an
opinion
with
respect
to
how
you
might
want
to
vote.
you
might
--
it
might
form
a
different
--
you
might
form
all
kinds
of
different
opinions.
but
it
was
--
it
was
an
analysis
of
the
background
record
and
history
and
qualifications
of
someone
running
for
president.
of
course
i
concede
that.
but
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
maker
of
a
movie
to
take
out
in
order
to
prevent
that
from
happening?
i
understand
from
some
of
the
questions
that
if
it
was
more
evenhanded
--
if
it
said,
well,
this
candidate
did
this,
but
this
candidate
did
this
or
this
candidate
was
born
in
the
panama
canal
zone
and
this
candidate
was
born
in
hawaii,
and
that
affects
whether
or
not
they
are
natural-born
citizens
or
not,
and
it
was
more
evenhanded,
would
that
then
not
be
a
felony?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
is
a
distinction
that
congress
was
concerned
about,
and
it's
a
distinction
that's
all
over
the
record--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--because
--
because
the
record
in
congress
and
the
record
in
this
court
is
that
those
types
of
advertisements
were
more
effective
because
they
came
into
your
home--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
--
the
--
i
think
the
--
what
--
what
congress
was
concerned
about
is
the
most
severe
and
the
most
acute
problem,
as
justice
kollar-kotelly
said,
which
everyone
acknowledges
was
the
problem
congress
sought
to
address
with
bcra.
it's
not
just
that,
however.
the
point
that
you
just
made
about
a
nonporous
border,
it
is
the
government's
responsibility
to
the
extent
that
you
can't
figure
out
how
evenhanded
you
must
be
or
what
you
must
take
out
of
your
communication
in
order
not
to
go
to
jail
for
airing
it,
it
is
the
functional
equivalent
--
if
everything
is
the
functional
equivalent
--
if
it
mentions
a
candidate
during
an
election,
which
is
what
the
government
says,
it's
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
prior
restraint,
because
you
don't
dare--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
agree
with
that
completely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
unquestionably
the
case
that
the
government
takes
the
position
that
any
form
of
--
of
expressive
advocacy
can
be
prohibited
if
it's
done
by
a
corporation.
they
say
that
on
page
25
and
26
of
their
brief,
whether
it
be
books,
yard
signs,
newspapers
or
--
or
something
printed
--
in
printed
form,
and
it's
only
because
congress
decided
to
address
the
most
acute
problem
that
they
haven't
--
congress
didn't
go
ahead
and
decide
to
do
that,
which
we
submit
would
raise
very,
very
serious
constitutional
questions,
the
same
type
of
constitutional
questions
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
and
that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--precisely,
and
five
justices
in
wisconsin
right
to
life
made
the
point
that
the
pac
mechanism
is
burdensome
and
expensive.
there
are
briefs
in
this
case
that
demonstrate
how
much
it
is.
and
the
--
and
it's
easier
if
you
have
lots
of
money,
if
you
are
a
big
corporation,
and
you
can
afford
a
pac
or
you
already
have
one.
so
it's
a
burden
on
the
least
capable
of
communicating.
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--of
course.
[laughter]
by
definition.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
i
am
saying
is
i
--
we
accept
the
court's
decision
in
wisconsin
right
to
life.
to
the
extent
that
the
court
did
not
get
to
this
type
of
documentary
where
the
issue
distinction,
the
false
dichotomy
between
issues
and
candidates--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
--
the
--
that
no
reasonable
--
not
reasonably
susceptible
to
any
other
interpretation?
of
course
we
do,
justice
stevens,
but
we
submit,
a
90-minute
discussion
of
various
different
issues
are
subject
to
all
kinds
of
interpretation,
and
when
you
get
a
long
exposition
of
issues
that
are
important
to
the
public
and
someone
says
--
the
government
says,
well,
it's
going
to
be
--
we
can
prohibit
it,
and
by
the
way,
the
government
says,
well,
when
we
mean
"prohibit"
we
mean
just
you
can't
use
your
union
--
or
corporate
treasury
funds
--
what
they
mean
by
"prohibit"
is
that
they
will
put
you
in
jail
if
you
do
it.
they
will
put
you
in
jail
for
5
years.
that
means
prohibited.
now,
what
--
what
we're
getting
at
here,
when
--
when
you're
trying
to
make
a
90-minute
movie
that
discusses
things
that
are
important
to
the
public
during
an
election
of
the
highest
officer
of
the
united
states,
many
people
will
interpret
that
as
critical;
many
people
will
interpret
it
as
supportive;
there
are
things
all
over
the
lot.
so
it's
subject
to
lots
of
different
interpretations.
the
other
thing
is
i
heard
justice
--
i
mean
mr.
stewart
say
that
if
there's
one
minute
at
the
beginning,
it
doesn't
happen
--
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
other
89
minutes
are;
we
can
prohibit
it.
well,
where
is
the
person
making
a
movie
who
wants
to
address
the
american
public
about
something
that's
important
to
the
american
public
--
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
--
where
does
he
edit
his
movie?
what
cuts?
what
does
he
leave
on
the
drawing
--
on
the
cutting-room
floor
so
that
he
won't
have
to
go
to
jail?
he
won't
dare
take
the
chance.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
robust
debate
about
candidates
for
elective
office
is
the
most
fundamental
value
protected
by
the
first
amendment's
guarantee
of
free
speech.
yet
that
is
precisely
the
dialogue
that
the
government
has
prohibited
if
practiced
by
unions
or
corporations,
any
union
or
any
corporation.
the
government
claims
it
may
do
so
based
upon
the
austin
decision
that
corporate
speech
is
by
its
nature
corrosive
and
distorting
because
it
might
not
reflected
actual
public
support
for
the
views
expressed
by
the
corporation.
the
government
admits
that
that
radical
concept
of
requiring
public
support
for
the
speech
before
you
can
speak
would
even
authorize
it
to
criminalize
books
and
signs.
this
court
needs
no
reminding
that
the
government
when
it
is
acting
to
prohibit,
particularly
when
it
is
acting
to
criminalize,
speech
that
is
at
the
very
core
of
the
first
amendment
has
a
heavy
burden
to
prove
that
there
is
a
compelling
governmental
interest
that
--
that
justifies
that
prohibition
and
that
the
regulation
adopted,
in
this
case
a
criminal
statute,
is
the
most
narrowly
tailored
necessary
to
accomplish
that
compelling
governmental
interest.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
the
court
has
said
in
the
first
amendment
context,
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
rose
jean
v.
associated
press,
and
over
and
over
again,
is
that
corporations
are
persons
entitled
to
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
now,
justice--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
court
in
the
past
has
made
no
distinction
based
upon
the
nature
of
the
entity
that
might
own
a
share
of
a
corporation.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
pardon?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
submit
that
the
court's
decisions
in
connection
with
the
first
amendment
and
corporations
have
in
the
past
made
no
such
distinction.
however--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying
that,
justice
ginsburg.
i'm
saying
that
the
first
amendment
applies.
then
the
next
step
is
to
determine
whether
congress
and
the
government
has
established
a
compelling
governmental
interest
and
a
narrowly
tailored
remedy
to
that
interest.
if
the
congress
--
and
there
is
no
record
of
that
in
this
case
of
which
i
am
aware.
certainly
the
government
has
not
advanced
it
in
its
briefs:
that
there
is
some
compelling
governmental
interest
because
of
foreign
investment
in
corporations.
if
there
was,
then
the
court
would
look
at,
determine
how
serious
is
that
interest,
how
destructive
has
it
been
to
the
process
and
whether
the
--
maybe
the
limitation
would
have
something
to
do
with
the
ownership
of
shares
of
a
corporation
or
some--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
--
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's,
of
course,
a
different
question.
i
haven't
studied
it,
justice
scalia.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
fundamental
point
here
is
--
and
let
me
start
with
this,
and
i
think
we
should
--
we
should
start
with
this,
and
the
government
hardly
mentions
this.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
language
of
the
first
amendment,
"congress
shall
make"--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
am
not
--
i'm
not
aware
of
a
case
that
just--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--my
view
is
based
upon
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
my
view
would
be
that
unless
there
is
a
compelling
governmental
interest
and
a
narrowly--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
would
not
rule
that
out,
justice
stevens.
i
mean,
there
may
be.
i
can't
imagine
all
of
the
infinite
varieties
of
potential
problems
that
might
exist,
but
--
but
we
would
eventually
come
back
to
the
narrow
tailoring
problem
anyway.
what
the
government
has
done
here
is
prohibit
speech.
i
don't
know
how
many
unions
there
are
in
this
country,
but
there
are
something
like
6
million
corporations
that
filed
tax
returns
in
2006.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
think
so,
justice
alito,
and
certainly
there
is
no
record
to
suggest
that
there
is
any
kind
of
problem
based
upon
that.
and
i
come
back
to
the
language
of
the
first
amendment:
"congress
shall
make
no
law".
now,
what
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
is
that
there
may
be
laws
inhibiting
speech
if
there
is
a
compelling
governmental
interest
and
a
narrowly
tailored
remedy.
but
there
is
no
justification
for
this.
i
was
going
to
say
that
97
percent
of
the
6
million
corporations
that
filed
tax
returns
in
2006
had
assets
less
than
$5
million
--
assets,
not
net
worth.
so
we
are
talking
about
a
prohibition
that
covers
every
corporation
in
the
united
states,
including
nonprofit
corporations,
limited
liability
corporations,
subchapter
s
corporations
and
every
union
in
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
respectfully
disagree.
the
corporation
may
not
expend
money.
it
might
find
people,
stockholders
or
officers,
who
wanted
to
contribute
to
a
separate
fund,
who
could
then
speak.
that
in
one
--
to
use
the
words
of
one
justice,
that
is
ventriloquist-speak.
i
would
say
that
it
is
more
like
surrogate
speech.
if
you
can
find
some
other
people
that
will
say
what
you
want
to
say
and
get
them
to
contribute
money
through
a
process
that
this
just--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
this
statute
is
not
limited
to
cases
where
the
shareholders
agree
or
don't
agree
with
what
the
corporation
says.
as
the
court
said
in
the
bellotti
case,
the
prohibition
would
exist
whether
or
not
the
shareholders
agree.
but
let
me
go
back
to
your
question.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
and
it
includes
membership
corporations
such
as
citizens
united
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no
--
well,
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
in
connection
with
contribution
limitations
there
is
a
potential
compelling
governmental
interest.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
this
is
what
buckley
says.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
then
that
--
in
that
--
but
expenditures,
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about
today,
do
not
concern
the
--
the
question,
the
actual
threat
of
quid
pro
quo
corruption
or
the
appearance
of
quid
pro
quo
corruption.
and
you
know,
justice
breyer,
what
the
court
said
in
that
case
is
because
it's
not
inhibiting
someone
from
actually
speaking,
it's
--
it's
giving
money
to
someone--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
in
the
first
place,
i
accept
what
the
court
said
in
buckley,
that
expenditures
do
not
raise
that
concern
at
all.
congress
has
not
made
that
finding.
you
are
talking
--
and
you
mentioned
just
--
just
a
matter
of
radio
and
television,
but
in
buckley
v.
valeo
the
court
specifically
said
that
that
is
the
most
important
means
of
communicating
concerning
elections--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
the
court
used
the
word
"indispensable".
so
what
--
and
--
and
what
the
court
said
in
buckley
v.
valeo
is
it
compared
a
limitation
on
expenditures,
independent
uncoordinated
expenditures,
with
the
prohibition
that
the
court
addressed
when
it
had
a
statute
before
it
that
said
newspapers
couldn't
endorse
candidates
on
the
day
of
election,
and
the
tornillo
case,
where
it
required
a
right
of
reply
to
be
given.
and
the
court
said
those
restrictions,
which
were
unconstitutional,
were
considerably
less,
and
that
the
restriction
in
buckley
v.
valeo
on
expenditures--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
in
the
first
place,
if
there
is
any
coordination--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--buckley
says--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
may
not
always
be
true.
in
the
infinite
potential
applications
of
something
like
that,
justice
kennedy,
anything
might
possibly
be
true.
and
justice
breyer
said,
well,
what
if
congress
thought
or
what
if
congress
thought
the
people
might
think
that
that
was
kind
of
somehow
suspect?
that
is
not
a
basis
for
prohibiting
speech
by
a
whole
class
of
individual--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--you
must
always
second-guess
congress
when
the
first
amendment
is
in
play.
and
that
we
are
arguing
--
we
are
not
--
we
are
discussing--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--both
the
compelling
----
[laughter]
--both
the
compelling
governmental
interest
and
the
narrow
tailoring,
and
what
--
what
--
there
is
not
a
sufficient
record.
the
reason
--
the
government
has
shifted
position
here.
they
were,
first
of
all,
talking
about
the
so-called
distortion
rationale
in
austin,
the
distortion
rationale
which
they
seem
to
have
abandoned
in
the
--
in
the
supplemental
briefs
filed
in
connection
with
this
argument,
and
they
resorted
to
the
corruption,
appearance
of
corruption.
there
isn't
a
sufficient
record
of
this.
there
isn't--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
find
--
yes.
i
--
there
is
something
to
that
effect
in
the
district
court
opinion,
but
it
doesn't
cover
all
corporations.
it
didn't
focus
in
specifically
on
expenditures.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
that
is
97
percent
of
the
corporation.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that
goes
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
and
my
response,
which
distinguishes
between
contributions
and
expenditures.
the
point
that
justice
kennedy
was
making
in
his
question
is
that
under
--
under
some
circumstances
an
expenditure
might
coincide
or
resonate
with
what
the
candidate
wishes
to
do,
but
the
court
looked
at
that
very
carefully
in
buckley
v.
valeo
and
said
that
might
not
be
the
case.
it
might,
in
fact,
be
these
expenditures
might
be
counterproductive
when
they
are
independent,
they
are
not
coordinated
with
the
candidate,
they
are
more
directly
expression
by
the
party
spending
the
money,
they
are
not
like
a
contribution,
so
they
are
more
of
an
infringement
on
the
right
to
speak.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
they
are
less
of
a
threat
of
corruption
because
there
is
less
--
there
is
no
quid
pro
quo
there,
and
if
there
is
it
would
be
punishable
as
a
crime.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
is
--
it
is
--
what
the
bellotti
court
said
is
that
we
are
not
deciding
that
question.
and
--
and
austin
did
address,
you
are
correct,
expenditures,
but
it
based
it
on
a
rationale--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
and
i
also
read
the
footnote
14
in
the
bellotti
case
that
cited
case
after
case
after
case
that
said
corporations
had
rights,
protected
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
i
am
not
disagreeing
with
what
you
just
said,
justice
stevens.
the
court
said
it
was
--
it
was
dicta,
because
the
court
did
not
deal
with--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
because
it
was
--
and
i
agree
the
bellotti
court
was
not
discussing
that.
but
the
bellotti
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
understand
and
i
don't
disagree
with
what
you
have
just
said,
justice
stevens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
--
that
is
--
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
bellotti
also
said
is
--
and
i
think
this
is
also
in
many
decisions
of
this
court
--
the
inherent
worth
of
speech
in
terms
of
its
capacity
for
informing
the
public
does
not
depend
upon
the
identity
of
the
source,
whether
corporation,
association,
union,
or
individual.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
is
a
distinction,
but
i
think
the
distinction
goes
back
to,
a,
expenditures
versus
contributions,
number
one;
and
then
secondly,
it
goes
back
to
what
this
court
said
in
conjunction
with
the
impossibility
of
finding
a
distinction
between
issue
ads
and
candidate
ads.
the
line
dissolves
on
practical
application.
the
interest--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--you
said
that
repeatedly,
including
most
recently
in
the
wisconsin
right
to
life
case.
and
it
first
appeared
in
buckley
itself.
the
distinction
is
very
hard
to
draw
between
the
interest
that
the
speaker
is
addressing
and
whether
it's
a
candidate
or
an
issue,
because
issues
are
wrapped
up
in
candidates.
the
corporation
interest
and
the
interests
that
its
fiduciary
officers
are
representing
when
it
speaks
on
behalf
of
the
corporation--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
but
the
words--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
what
the
court
--
to
use
--
to
use
the
words
of
the
court,
which
occurred
repeatedly,
is
that
the
distinction
dissolves
impractical
application.
that,
justice
stevens,
i
think
addresses
the
very
commonsense
point
that
when
you
are
addressing
an
issue,
whether
you
are
addressing
a
referendum
matter,
whether
it
is
a
proposed
legislation
or
a
candidate
that
is
going
to
raise
taxes
on
the
corporation,
those
distinctions
dissolve.
it's
all
first
amendment
freedom.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
$1,000
limit
in
buckley
was,
first
of
all,
limited
to
the
magic
words
"candidacy
expression";
then
secondly,
the
court
--
and
the
--
and
the
words
of
the
statute
were
"any
person",
which
included
corporations
found,
the
statute
as
narrowed
unconstitutional
and
said--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--some
of
the
plaintiffs
were
corporations.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
was
not
discussed
in
the
opinion.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
what
was
discussed
in
the
opinion
was
the
breadth
of
the
definition
of
"person",
which
did
include
corporation.
corporations
were
parties
in
the
case.
and
in
that
part
of
the
buckley
case,
the
court
repeatedly
cites
cases
involving
corporations,
including
naacp
v.
alabama
and
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
all
cases
involving
corporations.
so
while
it
wasn't
specifically
discussed,
it
was
a
part
of
the
decision
of
the
court
that
a
$1,000
limitation
was
worse,
more
restrictive
than
the
--
than
the
restriction
of
editorials
appearing
on
election
day
or
requiring
a
newspaper
to
give
a
right
of
reply.
the
court
in
buckley
in
fact
says,
this
is
--
with
respect
to
that
expenditure
limitation,
the
words
of
the
court
were
this
is
the
most
drastic
of
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
federal
election
campaign
act.
it
goes
to
the
core
of
first
amendment
freedom.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
you
are
wrong
about
the
consequence.
there
are
27
states
that
have
no
limitations
on
either
contributions
or
expenditures
and
that
--
the
earth
is
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
if
--
if
the
court
decides
in
favor
of
the
arguments
that
we
are
making
here,
i
think
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
because
there
are
other
limitations
that
someone
has
not
challenged
in
this
case,
that
that
would
be
somehow
unfair
and
unbalanced.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
--
i
want
to
address
that
in
this
way,
and
i
said
when
we
were
here
before
the
most
fundamental
right
that
we
can
exercise
in
a
democracy
under
the
first
amendment
is
dialogue
and
communication
about
political
candidates.
we
have
wrapped
up
that
freedom,
smothered
that
freedom,
with
the
most
complicated
set
of
regulations
and
bureaucratic
controls.
last
year
the
federal
election
commission
that
was
supposed
to
be
able
to
give
advisory
opinions
didn't
even
have
a
quorum
for
6
months
of
the
year
2008
when
people
would
have
needed
some
help
from
the
federal
election
commission.
what
i
am
saying,
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
there
are,
i
suspect,
all
kinds
of
problems
with
federal
election
laws
where
they
apply
to
parties
and
where
they
apply
to
what
candidates
might
do
and
so
forth;
but
that
has
never
been
a
justification.
we
will
uphold
a
prohibition
on
all
kinds
of
people
speaking
because
if
we
allowed
them
to
speak
someone
else
might
complain
that
they
don't
get
to
speak
as
much
as
they
would
like.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
i'm
not,
and
that's
--
i
think
that
was
what
i
was
attempting
to
say
in
response
to
what
justice
breyer
was
asking
me.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
justice
sotomayor.
what
--
what
--
there
are
all
kinds
of
lines
that
the
court
could
draw
which
would
provide
a
victory
to
my
client.
there
are
so
many
reasons
why
the
federal
government
did
not
have
the
right
to
criminalize
this
90-minute
documentary
that
had
to
do
with
elections,
but
what
the
court
addressed
specifically
in
the
washington
right
to
life
case
is
that
the
lines
if
they
are
to
be
drawn
must
not
be
lines
that
are
ambiguous,
that
invite
litigation,
that
hold
the
threat
of
prosecution
over
an
individual;
and
in
practical
application
that
is
what
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
would
like
to
answer
that.
there
are
several
answers
to
it
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
it
is
the
government
has
the
burden
to
prove
the
record
that
justifies
telling
someone
that
wants
to
make
a
90-minute
documentary
about
a
candidate
for
president
that
they
will
go
to
jail
if
they
broadcast
it.
the
government
has
the
obligation
and
the
government
had
a
long
legislative
record
and
plenty
of
opportunity
to
produce
that
record
and
it's
their
obligation
to
do
so.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
will,
justice
stevens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
every
line,
including
the
lines
that
would
be
drawn
in
several
of
the
amicus
briefs,
and
they
are
not
the
same,
could
put
the
entity
who
wishes
to
speak
before
you
again
a
year
from
now.
because
the
movie
might
be
shorter,
it
might
be
video
on
demand,
it
might
be
a
broadcast,
it
might
have
a
different
tone
with
respect
to
a
candidate.
every
one
of
those
lines
puts
the
speaker
at
peril
that
he
will
go
to
jail
or
be
prosecuted
or
there
will
be
litigation,
all
of
which
chills
speech
and
inhibits
individual--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
would
like
to
take
advantage
of
justice
stevens'
offer
and
respond
to
that
during
the
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
[laughter]
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
words
that
i
would
leave
with
this
court
are
the
solicitor
general's.
the
government's
position
has
changed.
the
government's
position
has
changed
as
to
what
media
might
be
covered
by
congressional
power
to
censor
and
--
and
ban
speech
by
corporations.
now
we
learn,
contrary
to
what
we
heard
in
march,
that
books
couldn't
be
prohibited
but
pamphlets
could
be
prohibited.
we
also
learn--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--unless
they
are
engaged
in,
quote,
"expressed
advocacy".
and
the
other
way
in
which
the
government
has
changed
its
position,
if
i
listened
carefully,
is
what
type
of
corporation
might
be
covered.
the
government
now
says
that
it
wouldn't
--
the
--
the
fec
is
now
willing
to
recede
from
its
regulations
which
explicitly
covered
this
corporation,
and
i
don't
know
as
i
stand
here
today
what
kind
of
corporations
the
government
would
choose
to
prosecute.
remember,
the
federal
election
commission,
which
didn't
even
have
a
quorum
and
couldn't
function
at
all
for
six
months
during
the
important
election
year
of
2008--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that's
your
question
from
before.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
that
--
(a),
it
wouldn't
--
this
corporation
accepted
a
small
amount,
$2,000
out
of
--
out
of
the
funding
of
this,
so
that
wouldn't
solve
the
problem
for
my
corporation,
my
client's
corporation.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if
--
but
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--my
point
is
that
the
overbreadth
in
this
statute
--
that
solves
the
problem
by
saying
that
corporations
still
can't
speak,
and
if
you
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
them,
you
--
you
--
they
wear
a
scarlet
letter
that
says
c.>
["]
if
you
accept
one
dollar
of
funding,
then
you
had
better
make
darn
sure
that
when
a
check
comes
in
for
$100
from
the
xyz
hardware
store
in
the
neighborhood,
that
it
wasn't
a
corporation
that
you
used
to
--
to
make
a
documentary
about
a
candidate.
the
other
way
in
which
the
government's
position
has
changed
is
we
do
not
know--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
--
i
submit
that
it
does
not
solve
the
problem.
it
would
lead
exactly--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
--
i
can't
say
that
it
--
if
it
solved
the
problem,
because
it
doesn't
solve
the
problem
of
prohibiting
all
corporate
speech.
and
i
think
--
and
i
am
submitting,
justice
stevens,
that
that
is
unconstitutional.
i
think
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
some
limitation
that
--
what
--
what
you
were
suggesting
is
not
a
whole
lot
different
than
pac.
it
would
lead,
i
think
justice
breyer
was
saying,
to
an
accounting
nightmare.
it
would
be--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
but
the
--
but
the
wellstone
amendment
sort
of
in
a
sense
repealed
it.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
what
--
what
the
--
my
response
is
that
that
does
not
solve
the
problem
of
inhibiting--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
we
don't
justice
stevens,
and
--
and,
as
i
said,
it
would
not
exempt
my
clients.
the
other
--
the
third
way
in
which
the
government
has
changed
its
position
is
its
rationale
for
this
prohibition
in
the
first
place.
is
it
corruption?
is
it
shareholder
protection?
is
it
equalization?
there
was
some
dispute.
i
heard
the
solicitor
general
say
that
the
equalization
rationale
was
something
the
government
disavowed.
it
wasn't
what
austin
said,
the
government
--
the
government
said.
and
i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
--
i
don't
--
with
all
due
respect
justice
ginsburg,
the
words
that
jump
out
at
me
are
the
words
from
page
665
that
say
the
desire
to
counterbalance
those
advantages
unique
to
the
corporate
forum
is
the
state's
compelling
interest
in
this
case.
that
sounds
to
me
like
--
like
equalization.
i
don't
know.
i
am
--
i
am
representing
an
individual
who
wants
to
speak
about
something
that's
the
most
important
thing
that
goes
on
in
our
democracy.
i'm
told
it's
a
felony.
i
am
not
--
and
i
--
i
don't
know
what
the
rational
basis
is.
it's
overbroad.
now
i
hear
about
this
shareholder
--
protecting
shareholders.
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
congressional
record
with
respect
to
the
--
which
was
before
the
court
in
the
mcconnell
case
about
protecting
shareholders.
as
the
bellotti
case
pointed
out,
that
would
be
overbroad
anyway
because
this
statute
applies
to
every--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
--
it
--
it
strikes
me
that
it
is,
because
it
follows
the
words
that
say
corporations
are
given
unique
advantages
to
aggregate
wealth
and
that
we
must
take
away
that
advantage
by
equalizing
the
process.
i
think
that's
the
plain
meaning
but
my
point
i
guess
is
--
if
i
may
finish
this
sentence.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
my
point
is
that
the
government
here
has
an
overbroad
statute
that
covers
every
corporation
irrespective
of
what
its
stockholders
think,
irrespective
of
whether
it's
big,
and
whether
it's
general
--
a
big
railroad
baron
or
anything
like
that,
and
it
doesn't
know,
as
it
stands
here
today
two
years
after
this
movie
was
offered
for
--
to
the
public
for
its
view,
what
media
might
be
covered,
what
type
of
corporation
might
be
covered
and
what
compelling
justification
or
narrow
standard
would
be
applied
to
this
form
of
speech.
