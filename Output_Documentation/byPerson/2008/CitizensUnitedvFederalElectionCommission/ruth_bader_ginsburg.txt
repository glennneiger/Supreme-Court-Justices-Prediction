was
that
--
was
that
established?
i
thought
that
the
record
was
hardly
made
of
the
contributors
to
this
film.
i
think
there
was
something
like
$200,000
accounted
for,
and
the
film
cost
--
to
get
the
channel
'08,
whatever
it
was,
to
put
it
on
cost
over
a
million
dollars?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
i
thought
you
conceded
in
the
--
at
least
as
i
read
your
reply
brief,
that
you
were
no
longer
saying
this
is
about
an
issue
unrelated
to
any
election.
i
thought
you
said
that
this
was
a
90-minute
movie
"concerning
the
qualifications,
character,
and
fitness
of
a
candidate
for
the
nation's
highest
office.
"
and
that's
just
what
wisconsin
right
to
life
was
not.
it
was
not
about
the
character,
qualifications,
and
fitness
of
either
of
the
senators.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't
the
court
there
say
this
is
not
about
character,
qualifications,
and
fitness?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
olson,
this
is
--
i
think
you
were
right
in
conceding
at
the
beginning,
this
is
not
like
the
speech
involved
in
wisconsin
right
to
life.
this
is
targeted
to
a
specific
candidate
for
a
specific
office
to
be
shown
on
a
channel
that
says
election
'08,
that
tells
the
--
the
viewer
over
and
over
again
what
--
just
for
example,
it
concludes
with
these
are
things
worth
remembering
before
you
go
in
potentially
to
vote
for
hillary
clinton.
now,
if
that
isn't
an
appeal
to
voters,
i
can't
imagine
what
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
film
has
been
compared
to
911>
["],
which
had
the
pervasive
message
that
president
bush
was
unsuited
to
be
president.
and
so
if
that
film
had
been
financed
out
of
the
corporate
--
a
corporation's
general
treasury
funds
and
put
on
an
election
channel,
that
would
similarly
be
banned
by
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
--
was
this
issue
aired
before
the
three-judge
court,
the
distinction
between,
say,
putting
something
on
network
tv
and
putting
something
on
view
on
demand
that
the
listener
has
to
opt
into?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
are
you
taking
the
position
that
there
is
no
difference
in
the
first
amendment
rights
of
an
individual?
a
corporation,
after
all,
is
not
endowed
by
its
creator
with
inalienable
rights.
so
is
there
any
distinction
that
congress
could
draw
between
corporations
and
natural
human
beings
for
purposes
of
campaign
finance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
that
include--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--would
that
include
today's
mega-corporations,
where
many
of
the
investors
may
be
foreign
individuals
or
entities?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
own
many
shares?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nowadays
there
are
foreign
interests,
even
foreign
governments,
that
own
not
one
share
but
a
goodly
number
of
shares.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
they
in
your
view,
in
the
view
that
you
are
putting
forth,
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
an
individual
and
a
corporation
for
first
amendment
purposes,
then
any
mega-corporation,
even
--
even
if
most
of
the
investors
are
from
abroad,
congress
could
not
limit
their
spending?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
are
the
--
you
have
used
the
word
mr.
olson.
one
answer
to
that
is
that
no
entity
is
being
prohibited,
that
it
is
a
question
of
not
whether
corporations
can
contribute
but
how.
they
can
use
pacs
and
that
way
we
assure
that
the
people
who
contribute
are
really
supportive
of
the
issue,
of
the
candidate.
but
so
the
--
the
corporation
can
give,
but
it
has
to
use
a
pac.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
is
the
"you"?
i
mean
do
you
--
you
--
those
are
the
directors,
the
ceo,
not
the
shareholders?
we
don't
know
what
they
think.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the
district
court's
finding?
wasn't
there
a
finding
before
the
three-judge
court
that
federal
officials
know
of
and
feel
indebted
to
corporations
or
unions
who
finance
ads
urging
their
election
or
the
defeat
of
their
opponent?
there
was
a
finding
of
fact
to
that
effect,
was
there
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
--
so
if
they
just
covered
large
corporations,
so
you
take
out
the
mom
and
pop
single
shareholder--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
97
percent
of
the
contributions.
i
mean,
the
contributions
that
count
are
the
ones
from
the
corporations
that
can
amass
these
huge
sums
in
their
treasuries.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
abrams,
times
v.
sullivan
was
not
--
did
not
involve
overruling
precedents
of
this
court
that
had
been
followed
by
this
court
and
others.
so,
i
think
the
situation
is
quite
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
decision
of
this
court,
i
mean--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
do
tend
to
adhere
to
our
precedents--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--especially
a
case
like
austin
which
was
repeating
the
business
about
amassing
large
funds
in
corporate
treasuries.
it
was
not
a
new
idea
in
austin,
and
it
was
repeated
after
--
after
austin.
but
there
was
--
so
times
v.
sullivan
i
think
is
quite
distinct.
the
question
that
was
posed
here
is,
is
it
a
proper
way
to
resolve
this
case,
to
overrule
one
precedent
in
full
and
another
in
part?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
the
court
said
in
austin
it
also
said
in
the
nrwc
case,
which
was
i
think
8
years
before
austin.
so
austin
was
not
a
new
invention.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
have
been
limits
on
corporate
spending
in
aid
of
a
political
campaign
since
the
turn
of
the
20th
century.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
that
respect,
it's
unlike
the
union,
because
the
--
the
worker
who
does
not
want
to
affiliate
with
a
union
cannot
have
funds
from
his
own
pocket
devoted
to
political
causes.
but
there
is
no
comparable
check
for
corporations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
mean
that
unions
should
be
taken
out,
because
there
isn't
the
same
--
the
shareholder
protection
interest
doesn't
--
there
is
no
parallel
for
the
union?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
one
question
that
was
highlighted
in
the
prior
argument,
and
that
was
if
congress
could
say
no
tv
and
radio
ads,
could
it
also
say
no
newspaper
ads,
no
campaign
biographies?
last
time
the
answer
was,
yes,
congress
could,
but
it
didn't.
is
that
--
is
that
still
the
government's
answer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
--
this
statute
doesn't
cover.
it
doesn't
cover
books.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
--
the
--
the
statute
that
we
are
involved
in,
in
this
case
does
not
cover
those.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
marshall
said
that
he
was
not
trying
to
equalize
all
voices
in
the
political
process.
he
has
a
sentence
that
says,
well,
that's
not
what
the
rationale
of
this
case
is.
