mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
lead
opinion
in
wisconsin
right
to
life
didn't
just
use
the
term
2667
of
volume
127
of
the
supreme
court
reporter,
the
plurality
or
the
lead
opinion
stated:
"in
light
of
these
considerations,
a
court
should
find
that
an
ad
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy
only
if
the
ad
is
susceptible
of
no
reasonable
interpretation
other
than
as
an
appeal
to
vote
for
or
against
a
specific
candidate.
"
so
the
functional
equivalence
test
doesn't
depend
on
the
length
of
the
advertisement
or
the
medium
in
which
the
advertisement--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
certainly
congress
considered
a
variety
of
evidence
bearing
on
campaign
practices
that
had
been
undertaken
in
the
past.
they
were
primarily
--
most
of
the
examples
on
which
they
focused
were
30-second
and
60-second
advertisements.
it's
certainly
been
a
recurring
phenomenon
in
the
past
that
candidates
would
air,
for
instance,
30-minute
infomercials.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'm
not
sure
about
the
citation;
i'm
not
aware
of
any
citation
in
mcconnell
or
the
congressional
record,
but
it
was
certainly
a
known
phenomenon.
and
i
think
the
real
key
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
real
--
i
think
the
real
key
to
ascertaining
congress's
intent
is
to
look
to
the
definition
of
electioneering
communication
that
congress
enacted
into
the
statute,
and
that
definition
requires
that
the
communication
be
a
broadcast,
cable,
or
satellite
communication
in
order
to
qualify
as
an
electioneering
communication,
and
that
it
be
aired
within
a
certain
proximity
to
a
federal
election,
and
that
in
the
case
of
an--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if
it's
aired
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time,
that
would
be
covered.
now,
under
this
court's
decision
in
wisconsin
right
to
life,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
those
advertisements,
because
those
advertisements
certainly
would
be
susceptible
of
a
reasonable
construction--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
--
the
constitution
would
have
permitted
congress
to
apply
the
electioneering
communication
restrictions
to
the
extent
that
they
were
otherwise
constitutional
under
wisconsin
right
to
life.
those
could
have
been
applied
to
additional
media
as
well.
and
it's
worth
remembering
that
the
pre-existing
federal
election
campaign
act
restrictions
on
corporate
electioneering
which
have
been
limited
by
this
court's
decisions
to
express
advocacy--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i'm
not
saying
it
could
be
banned.
i'm
saying
that
congress
could
prohibit
the
use
of
corporate
treasury
funds
and
could
require
a
corporation
to
publish
it
using
its
pac.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
of
course,
the
statute
contains
its
own
media
exemption
or
media--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--because
the
first
amendment
refers
both
to
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
press,
there
would
be
a
potential
argument
that
media
corporations,
the
institutional
press,
would
have
a
greater
first
amendment
right.
that
question
is
obviously
not
presented
here.
the
--
the
other
two
things--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if
the
book
contained
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy.
that
is,
if
it
was
subject
to
no
reasonable
interpretation--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
statute
applies
to
cable,
satellite,
and
broadcast
communications.
and
the
court
in
mcconnell
has
addressed
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
--
it
can't
be
prohibited,
but
a
corporation
could
be
barred
from
using
its
general
treasury
funds
to
publish
the
book
and
could
be
required
to
use
--
to
raise
funds
to
publish
the
book
using
its
pac.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
if
it
says
vote
for
x,
it
would
be
express
advocacy
and
it
would
be
covered
by
the
pre-existing
federal
election
campaign
act
provisions.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
if
it's
a
book
and
it
is
produced
--
again,
to
leave
--
to
leave
to
one
side
the
question
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
possible
media
exemption,
if
you
had
citizens
united
or
general
motors
using
general
treasury
funds
to
publish
a
book
that
said
at
the
outset,
for
instance,
hillary
clinton's
election
would
be
a
disaster
for
this--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes,
our
position
would
be
that
the
corporation
could
be
required
to
use
pac
funds
rather
than
general
treasury
funds.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
if
they
didn't,
we
could
prohibit
the
publication
of
the
book
using
the
corporate
treasury
funds.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct,
and
they--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
would
raise
a
constitutional--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
not
present
in
the
case.
i
don't
think
it
would
raise
a
difficult
constitutional
question
because
presumably
if
the
reason
the
corporation
couldn't
do
it
through
the
pac
--
the
only
reason
i
could
think
of
is
that
it
couldn't
find
pac-eligible
donors
who
were
willing
to
contribute
for
this
speech.
and
if
that's
the
case,
the
corporation
would
--
could
still
be
forbidden
to
use
its
general
treasury.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct,
both
because
the
question
isn't
presented
here
and
because
congress--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
court
has
already
held
in
--
both
in
austin
and
in
mcconnell,
that
congress
can
or
that
congress
or
state
legislatures
can
prohibit
the
use
of
corporate
treasury
funds
for
express
advocacy.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
in
mcfl,
for
instance,
the
communication
was
not
a
book,
but
it
was
a
newsletter,
it
was
written
material;
and
the
court
held
this
was
express
advocacy
for
which
the
use
of
corporate
treasury
funds
would
ordinarily
be
banned.
it
held
that
because
of
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
the
particular
corporation
at
issue
in
that
case,
mcfl
was
entitled
to
a
constitutional
exemption.
but
i
think
the
clear
thrust
of
mcfl
is
that
the
publication
and
dissemination
of
a
newsletter
containing
express
advocacy
could
ordinarily
be
banned
with
respect
to
the
use
of
corporate
treasury
funds.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
again,
i
do
want
to
make
clear
that
if
by
"prohibition"
you
mean
ban
on
the
use
of
corporate
treasury
funds,
then,
yes,
i
think
it's
absolutely
clear
under
austin,
under
mcconnell
that
the
use
of
corporate
treasury
funds
could
be
banned
if
general
motors,
for
instance,
wanted
to
produce--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
there
has
always
been--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
the
difficult
constitutional
question
of
whether
the
general
restrictions
on
use
of
corporate
treasury
funds
for
electioneering
can
constitutionally
be
applied
to
media
corporations
has
never
had
to
be
addressed
because
the
statutes
that
this
court
has
reviewed
have--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--in
--
in
any
event,
the
only
question
this
court
would
potentially
need
to
decide
in
this
case
is
whether
the
exemption
for
media
companies
creates
a
disuniformity
that
itself
renders
the
statute
unconstitutional,
and
the
court
has
already
addressed
that
question
in
mcconnell.
the
claim
was
made
that
because
media
corporations
were
exempt,
there
was
inequality
of
treatment
as
between
those
and
other
corporations.
and
congress
said
no,
congress
--
i
mean,
this
court
said
no,
congress
can
protect
the
interests
of
the
media
and
of
the
public
in
receiving
information
by
drawing
that
line.
with
respect
to
your--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
exactly
what
the
remedy
would
be,
whether
there
would
be
a
basis
for
suppressing
the
distribution
of
the
book,
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
it's
clear
under--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
wouldn't
be
an
electioneering
communication
under
bcra
because
bcra
wouldn't
apply
to
the
print
media.
now,
it
would
potentially
be
covered
by
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
--
we
would
certainly
take
the
position
that
if
the
labor
union
used
its
treasury
funds
to
pay
an
author
to
produce
a
book
that
would
constitute
express
advocacy,
that
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
labor
union's
conduct
would
be
prohibited.
the
question
of
whether
the
book
that
had
already
been--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
question
whether
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
i
would
have
to
study
the
federal
election
campaign
act
provisions
more
closely
to
see
whether
they--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
again,
it
wouldn't
qualify
as
an
electioneering
communication
under
bcra
because
that
statutory
definition
only
applies--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
use
of
labor
union
funds,
as
part
of
the
overall
enterprise
of
writing
and
then
publishing
the
book,
would
be
covered.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and
i
--
i
don't--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
i
think
it
would
be
constitutional
to
forbid
the
labor
union
to
do
that.
whether
it
would--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
whether
in
the
context
of
a
600-page
book
that
would
be
sufficient
to
make
the
book
either
an
electioneering
communication
or
express
advocacy--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
the
court
has
already
crossed
that
bridge
in
wisconsin
right
to
life
by
saying
the
statute
could
constitutionally
be
applied
only
if
it
were
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy,
and
--
so
that
would
be
the
--
and
we
accept
that
constitutional
holding.
that
would
be
the
relevant
constitutional
question.
i
wanted
to
return
for
a
second,
justice
alito,
to
a
question
you
asked
about
the
purported
interchangeability
of
the
internet
and
television.
and
it's
certainly
true
that
--
that
a
growing
number
of
people
are
coming
to
experience
those
media
as
essentially
interchangeable,
but
there
are
still
a
lot
of
people
either
who
don't
have
computers
at
all
or
who
use
their
televisions
and
their
computers
for
fundamentally
different
purposes.
and
i
think
it's
evident
that
citizens
united
perceived
the
two
media
to
be
distinct
because
it
was
willing
to
pay
$1.2
million
to
a
cable
service
in
order
to
have
the
film
made
available
on
--
by
video
on
demand,
when
citizens
united
could
have
posted
the
film
on
its
own
web
site,
posted
the
film
on
youtube,
and
could
have
avoided
both
the
need
to
make
the
payment
and
the
potential
applicability
of
the
electioneering
communications
provisions.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
our
position
is
not
that
the
constitution
would
permit
it.
our
position
is
that
bcra
wouldn't
prohibit
it
because
those
are
not
covered
media.
now--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes,
i
mean,
the
court
in
mcconnell
upheld
on
the
electioneering
communications
on
their
face,
and
this
court
--
a
majority
of
this
court
in
wisconsin
right
to
life
said
those
provisions
are
constitutional
as
applied--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but,
again,
this
--
the
court
obviously
has
grappled
in
the
past
with
the
question
of
how
to
apply
that
provision
to
use
of
corporate
treasury
funds
either
for
express
electoral
advocacy
or
its
functional
equivalent--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
is
of
no
constitutional
significance.
congress
certainly
could
have
drafted
the
electioneering
communication
definition--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
the
court
has
twice
upheld
the
statute
as
applied
to
communications
that
are
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy.
so--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
would
depend
on
the
ground
under
which
you
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
film
was
protected.
if
you
disagreed
with
our
submission
and
said
there
is
a
constitutional
difference
between
90-minute
films
and
60-second
advertisements,
then
obviously
you
could
draw
that
constitutional
line.
if
you
concluded
that
they're
all
the
same
but
they're
all
protected,
then
obviously
we
would
lose
both
cases.
but,
again,
you
would
have
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
--
that's
correct.
now,
it
may
be
the
case
--
it
may
be
rarer
to
find
a
90-minute
film
that
is
so
unrelenting
in
its
praise
or
criticism
of
a
particular
candidate
that
it
will
be
subject
to
no
reasonable
interpretation
other
than
to
vote
for
or
against
that
person,
but
when
you
have
that,
as
i
think
we
do
here,
there's
no
constitutional
distinction
between
the
90-minute
film
and
the
60-second
advertisement.
and
we
would
stress
with
respect
to
the
film
that
what
makes
this,
in
our
view,
an
easy
case
is
not
simply
that
the
film
repeatedly
criticizes
hillary
clinton's
character
and
integrity.
the
clincher
is
that
the
film
repeatedly
links
senator
clinton's
purported
character
flaws
to
her
qualifications
for
president.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
essentially
the
argument
that
a
majority
of
this
court
rejected
in
wisconsin
right
to
life;
that
is,
that
that
was
part
of
the
basis
on
which
congress
enacted
bcra,
part
of
the
reason
that
it
wanted
to
establish
a
purely
objective
test
based
on
naming
an
identified
candidate
and
airing
in
proximity
to
the
election.
congress
recognized
that
in
many
situations
the
most
effective
advocacy
is
the
subtler
advocacy.
and
the
--
the
lead
opinion
in
wisconsin
right
to
life
said
--
i
think
recognized
that
it
will
foreseeably
be
the
case
that
corporations
will
craft
advertisements
that
are,
in
fact,
intended
to
influence
federal
elections
but
that
are
sufficiently
subtle
and
opaque
that
they
won't
constitute
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy.
and
--
and
the
lead
opinion
simply
said
that's
the
price
that
we
have
to
pay
in
order
to
ensure
that
an
unduly
broad
range
of
corporate
speech
is
not
restricted.
and
we
accept
that
holding,
but
in
this
case
what
we
have,
people
may
feel
--
is
not
subtle.
people
may
feel
that
because
it's
not
subtle,
it's
less
likely
to
be
effective.
but
the
court's
decisions
have
never
drawn
a
constitutional
line
between
advocacy
that
is
likely
to
be
effective
and
advocacy
that
is
not.
clearly,
if
this
were
express
advocacy
--
i
think
clearly,
if
the
--
the
narrator
had
said
in
the
first
30
seconds
of
the
film:
a
hillary
clinton
presidency
would
pose
a
danger
to
the
country,
it's
important
for
all
citizens
to
vote
against
hillary
clinton,
what
follows
are
extended
analyses
of
episodes
in
her
past
that
reflect
hillary
clinton's
unsuitability
for
that
office.
and
if
then
in
the
last
89
minutes
of
the
film
the
filmmaker
had
made
no
overt
reference
to
the
upcoming
election
but
had
simply
given
a
negative
portrayal
of
hillary
clinton,
the
person,
that
would
be
express
advocacy
that
would
be
proscribable
even
without
regard
to
bcra.
so
that
if--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
it's
not
clear
whether
it
was
presented
to
congress
or
not.
it
is
certainly
true
that
it
was
not
the
focus
of
congressional
attention.
but
we
know
from
the
definition
of
"electioneering
communication"
what
attributes
congress
wanted
to
make
relevant
to
the
coverage
determination.
that
is,
it
chose
to
restrict
this
to
broadcast,
cable,
and
satellite
communications
and
to
leave
out
the
print
media.
it
chose
to
restrict
it
to
advertisements
or
other
communications
that
were
aired
within
a
specific
proximity
to
the
election.
if
it
had
been
unconcerned
with
communications
over
a
certain
length,
it
could
certainly
have
made
that
part
of
the
statutory
definition,
but
it
chose
not
to
do
that.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
familiar
enough
with
that
film
to
know
whether
it
would
have
constituted
--
to
--
to
make
an
informed
judgment
about
whether
that
would
have
constituted
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy
under
wisconsin
right
to
life.
and,
of
course,
the
2004.
but
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
--
i
think
the
--
first
of
all,
i
think
if
we
had
tried
to
make
the
argument
in
mcconnell
that
the
bcra
provisions,
or
--
or
in
any
other
case,
that
the
bcra
provisions
are
constitutional
as
applied
to
30
or
60-second
advertisements
because
they
are
defensible
means
of
protecting
listeners
who,
by
hypothesis,
don't
want
to
hear
the
message
in
the
form
of
a
captive
audience,
i
don't
think
we
would
have
gotten
very
far.
i
think
it's
certainly
true
that
people
have
a
wide
variation
of
attitudes
towards
campaign
advertisements.
some
of
them
find
them
irritating,
and,
of
course,
they
can
hit
the
mute
button
or
--
or
leave
the
room,
or
in
the
case
of
people
who
use
tivo
or
vcrs
can
simply
fast-forward
through
them.
but
the
whole
premise
of
the
congressional
regulation
and
the
whole
premise
of
the
corporation's
willingness
to
spend
these
massive
amounts
of
money
was
that
enough
people
will
be
interested
in
the
advertisements
that
they
will
ultimately
have
an
electoral
effect.
and
--
and
so
if
you
compare
the
--
the
film
to
the
advertisement,
the
advertisements,
in
one
sense,
you
could
say
are
a
less
effective
mechanism
because
a
lot
of
the
people
who
reach
them
are
unwilling
listeners
or
uninterested.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
they're
more
effective
because
they
reach
more
people.
the
--
the
flip
side
is
that
with
the
film
you
reach
a
smaller
audience.
it's
certainly
a
more
limited
group
of
people
who
will
sign
up
to
receive
the
movie,
but
they
are
more
interested
in
the
message.
i
don't
think
you
can
operate
on
the
hypothesis
that
there
is
no--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
it
was--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
it
would
be
impossible
to
divide
media
up
in
that
way
based
on
the
relative
likelihood
that
the
recipient
of
the
message
will
want
to
hear
it.
with
respect
to
the
--
the
newsletters
in
mcfl,
for
instance,
on
the
one
--
in
many
instances,
they
were
made
available
in
public
places.
they
were
also
mailed
to
a
variety
of
people.
you
could
say--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
potential
viewers
in
this
case
had
other
alternatives
if
they
wanted
to
see
the
film.
the
film
was
available--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
indeed,
the
--
the
appellant
in
its
complaint
simply
alleged
affirmatively
that
his
communication,
if
aired
on
dvd
--
i
mean
if
aired
on
vod
would
fall
within
the
statutory
definition
of
"electioneering
communication".
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
this
court
has
recognized
a
constitutional
exemption
for
two
disclosure
requirements
in
cases
where
disclosure
would
have
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
leading
to
reprisal.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
seems
unlikely
that
reprisals
would
occur
because
citizens
united
--
this
is
obviously
a
new
film,
but
it
is
of
a
piece
with
communications
that
citizens
united
has
engaged
in.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
guess
the
point
i
was
going
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
point
was
that
they
have
disclosed
in
the
past
and
have
provided
no
evidence
of
reprisals.
but
i
think
the
court's
decisions
are
clear
that
the
burden
is
on
the
organization
to
show
a
reasonable
likelihood,
at
least
to
--
to
set
the
--
the
ball
in
motion.
and
the
three-judge
district
court
here
said
essentially
what
this
court
said
in
mcconnell
with
regard
to
a
variety
of
plaintiffs
who
included
citizens
united.
that
is,
the
court
said
in
mcconnell
and
the
three-judge
district
court
here
that
the
plaintiffs
had
made
vague
allegations
of
the
general
possibility
of
reprisals
but
had
offered
no
concrete
evidence
that
their
own
members--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
the
alternatives
would
be
to
say
that
disclosure
requirements
are
categorically
unconstitutional,
which
would
be
an
extreme
departure
from
this
court's
prior
precedents
or--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
i
mean
i
think
the
--
if
the
--
we
think
the
test
in
mcconnell
is
workable;
that
is,
leave
it
up
to
the
organization
to
establish
particularized
proof
of
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
reprisal.
if
you
were
going
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
it
would
depend
to
some
extent
on
the
characteristics
of
the
ad.
probably
not,
but
i
think
if
the
alternative
--
the
two
alternatives
to
the
approach
that
the
court
has
taken
previously
would
be
first
to
say
these
requirements
are
unconstitutional
across
the
board,
or
the
court
could
say
as
applied
to
organizations
that
engage
in
especially
intemperate
or
extreme
speech
of
the
sort
that
might
seem
more
likely
to
subject
its
proponents
to
reprisal,
the
disclosure
requirements
are
categorically
unconstitutional
there.
i
think
that
would
be
itself
an
anomalous
and
counterproductive
content-based
distinction
if
the
mere
fact
of
the
extremity
of
your
speech
insolated
you
from
a
constitutional
--
from
a
requirement
that
would
otherwise
be
constitutional.
