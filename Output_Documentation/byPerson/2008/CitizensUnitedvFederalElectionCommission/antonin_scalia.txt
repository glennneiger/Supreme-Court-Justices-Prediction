justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
educate
in
30
seconds.
i
mean
in
--
in
a
30-second
ad
you
present
just
one
of
these
criticisms
of
the
candidate
instead
of
lumping
all
of
them
together
for
90
minutes.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
that
educate?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
are
you
making
a
--
a
statutory
argument
now
or
a
constitutional
argument?
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
has
nothing
to
do,
it
seems
to
me,
with
the
constitutional
point
you're
arguing.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
making
a
statutory
argument
now?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
this
--
this
isn't
covered
by
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
olson,
i
--
i
think
we've
been
led
astray
by
--
by
the
constant
reference
to
what
congress
intended.
as
i
understood
your
point,
it
was
not
--
it
was
not
that,
well,
one
is
covered
by
the
statute
and
the
other
isn't,
but
it
is
that
one
is
covered
by
the
constitution
and
the
other
isn't.
and
it
may
well
be
that
--
that
the
kind
of
speech
that
is
reflected
in
a
serious
90-minute
documentary
is
entitled
to
greater
constitutional
protection.
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
kind
of
speech
that
is
not
only
offered
but
invited
by
the
listener
is
entitled
to
--
is
entitled
to
heightened
first
amendment
scrutiny,
which
is
--
which
is
what
this
is
since
you
have
pay
per
view
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
you
--
you
get
around
the
fact
that
this
would
extend
to
any
publishing
corporation
by
saying
that
there
is
a
media
exemption
because
the
constitution
guarantees
not
only
freedom
of
speech
but
also
of
the
press?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
does
"the
press"
mean
the
media
in
that
constitutional
provision?
you
think
in
1791
there
were
--
there
were
people
running
around
with
fedoras
that
had
press
--
little
press
tickets
in
it,
"press"?
is
that
what
"press"
means
in
the
constitution?
doesn't
it
cover
the
xerox
machine?
doesn't
it
cover
the
--
the
right
of
any
individual
to
--
to
write,
to
publish?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
it
wouldn't.
i'm
saying
there's
no
basis
in
the
text
of
the
constitution
for
exempting
press
in
the
sense
of,
what,
the
fifth
estate?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i'm
a
little
disoriented
here,
mr.
stewart.
we
are
dealing
with
a
constitutional
provision,
are
we
not,
the
one
that
i
remember
which
says
congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
the
press?
that's
what
we're
interpreting
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stewart,
do
you
think
that
there's
a
possibility
that
the
first
amendment
interest
is
greater
when
what
the
government
is
trying
to
stifle
is
not
just
a
speaker
who
wants
to
say
something
but
also
a
hearer
who
wants
to
hear
what
the
speaker
has
to
say?
i
mean,
what's
somewhat
different
about
this
case
is
that,
unlike
over-the-air
television,
you
have
a
situation
where
you
only
get
this
--
this
message
would
only
air
--
if
somebody
elects
to
hear
it.
so
you
really
have
two
interested
people,
the
speaker
and
the
listener
who
wants
to
--
who
wants
to
get
this.
isn't
that
a
somewhat
heightened
first
amendment
interest
than
just
over-the-air
broadcasting
of
advertising
which
probably
most
listeners
don't
want
to
hear?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
about
effectiveness.
that
wasn't
my
point.
my
point
was
the
--
the
seriousness
of
the
first
amendment
interest
that's
being
impinged
where
--
where
you
have
both
somebody
who
wants
to
speak
and
someone
who
affirmatively
wants
to
hear
what
he
has
to
say,
and
the
government
says,
no,
the
two
of
you
can't
do
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
that's
somewhat
worse
than
the
government
just
saying
to
somebody
who
wants
to
speak,
no,
you
can't
speak?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
not
saying
will
--
will
want.
i
mean
you
have
a
situation
here
where
you
don't
get
it
unless
you
take
the
initiative
to
subscribe.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
trying
to
figure
out
person
by
person
who
wants
to
hear
it
and
who
doesn't.
here
you
have
a
medium
in
which
somebody
listens
only
if
that
person
wants
to
listen.
so
the
--
the
person
speaking
wants
to
speak,
and
the
person
hearing
wants
to
hear.
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
stronger
--
a
stronger
first
amendment
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
good
answer.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
congress
could
prevent
foreign
individuals
from
funding
speech
in
united
states
elections?
justice
antonin
scalia
private
individuals,
foreigners
who
--
who
want
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it's
not
different.
i
asked
it
because
i
thought
it
was
related
to
the
question
you
were
answering.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
--
it
covers
totally
--
totally
owned
corporations,
too,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
i
owned
all
the
stock
in
a
corporation,
the
corporation
still
can't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
didn't
say
it
would
come
out
differently.
it
just
said,
we're
not
deciding
that
case,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
mind
citing
that.
bellotti
didn't
decide
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
--
i
thought
that
buckley
had
narrowed
the
statute
precisely
to
magic
words
and
still
found
it
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
corporations
that
made
independent
expenditures.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
what
happened
in
buckley?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
some
of
the
plaintiffs
were
corporations.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
keep
us
in
suspense.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
--
there
are
two
separate
questions
that
--
that
have
been
raised
in
opposition
to
your
position.
one
is
--
one
is
that
we
should
not
resolve
a
broad
constitutional
issue
where
there
are
narrower
grounds,
and
that's
the
question
you
are
responding
to.
an
entirely
separate
question
is
the
issue
of
stare
decisis,
and
you
acknowledge
that
stare
decisis
was
not
involved
in
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
but
the
first
question
obviously
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
we
never
questioned
it,
but
we
never
approved
it,
either.
and
we
gave
some
really
weird
interpretations
to
the
taft-hartley
act
in
order
to
avoid
confronting
the
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
are
saying.
i
mean,
we
are
not
a
self
--
self-starting
institution
here.
we
only
disapprove
of
something
when
somebody
asks
us
to.
and
if
there
was
no
occasion
for
us
to
approve
or
disapprove,
it
proves
nothing
whatever
that
we
didn't
disapprove
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
--
let's
talk
about
overbreadth.
you've
--
let's
assume
that
that
is
a
valid
interest.
what
percentage
of
the
total
number
of
corporations
in
the
country
are
not
single
shareholder
corporations?
the
local
hairdresser,
the
local
auto
repair
shop,
the
local
new
car
dealer
--
i
don't
know
any
small
business
in
this
country
that
isn't
incorporated,
and
the
vast
majority
of
them
are
sole-shareholder-owned.
now
this
statute
makes
it
unlawful
for
all
of
them
to
do
the
things
that
you
are
worried
about,
you
know,
distorting
other
--
the
interests
of
other
shareholders.
that
is
vast
overbreadth.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
the
corruption
interest.
you
--
you
have
your
quid
pro
quo
argument,
that's
another
one.
we
get
to
that
when
we
get
there.
but
as
far
as
the
interest
you
are
now
addressing,
which
is
those
shareholders
who
don't
agree
with
this
political
position
are
being
somehow
cheated,
that
doesn't
apply
probably
to
the
vast
majority
of
corporations
in
this
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
can't
be
the
justification--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
if
it
were,
the
statute
would
be
vastly
overbroad.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
has
a
self-interest.
i
mean,
we
--
we
are
suspicious
of
congressional
action
in
the
first
amendment
area
precisely
because
we
--
at
least
i
am
--
i
doubt
that
one
can
expect
a
body
of
incumbents
to
draw
election
restrictions
that
do
not
favor
incumbents.
now
is
that
excessively
cynical
of
me?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
kagan,
most
--
most
corporations
are
indistinguishable
from
the
individual
who
owns
them,
the
local
hairdresser,
the
new
auto
dealer
--
dealer
who
has
just
lost
his
dealership
and
--
and
who
wants
to
oppose
whatever
congressman
he
thinks
was
responsible
for
this
happening
or
whatever
congressman
won't
try
to
patch
it
up
by
--
by
getting
the
auto
company
to
undo
it.
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
individual
interest
and
the
corporate
interest.
and
that
is
true
for
the
vast
majority
of
corporations.
justice
antonin
scalia
yet
this
law
freezes
all
of
them
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
he
wants
to
put
up
a
sign--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
happened
to
the
overbreadth
doctrine?
i
mean,
i
thought
our
doctrine
in
the
fourth
amendment
is
if
you
write
it
too
broadly,
we
are
not
going
to
pare
it
back
to
the
point
where
it's
constitutional.
if
it's
overbroad,
it's
invalid.
what
has
happened
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
--
you
are
a
lawyer
advising
somebody
who
is
about
to
come
out
with
a
book
and
you
say
don't
worry,
the
fec
has
never
tried
to
send
somebody
to
prison
for
this.
this
statute
covers
it,
but
don't
worry,
the
fec
has
never
done
it.
is
that
going
to
comfort
your
client?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
great
aggregations
of
wealth.
the
brief
by
the
chamber
of
commerce,
the
amicus
brief
by
the
chamber
of
commerce
points
out
that
96
percent
of
its
members
employ
less
than
100
people.
these
are
not
aggregations
of
great
wealth.
you
are
not
talking
about
the
railroad
barons
and
the
rapacious
trusts
of
the
elihu
root
era;
you
are
talking
mainly
about
small
business
corporations.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that
answer.
i
mean,
if
that's
what
you
were
concerned
about,
what
elihu
root
was
concerned
about,
you
could
have
said
all
corporations
that
have
a
net
worth
of
more
than,
you
know,
so
much
or
whatever.
that
is
not
what
congress
did.
it
said
all
corporations.
