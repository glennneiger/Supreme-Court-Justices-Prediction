justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
the
constitution
required
congress
to
draw
the
line
where
it
did,
limiting
this
to
broadcast
and
cable
and
so
forth?
what's
your
answer
to
mr.
olson's
point
that
there
isn't
any
constitutional
difference
between
the
distribution
of
this
movie
on
video
demand
and
providing
access
on
the
internet,
providing
dvds,
either
through
a
commercial
service
or
maybe
in
a
public
library,
providing
the
same
thing
in
a
book?
would
the
constitution
permit
the
restriction
of
all
of
those
as
well?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
pretty
incredible.
you
think
that
if
--
if
a
book
was
published,
a
campaign
biography
that
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
advocacy,
that
could
be
banned?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
most
publishers
are
corporations.
and
a
--
a
publisher
that
is
a
corporation
could
be
prohibited
from
selling
a
book?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
not
asking
what
the
statute
says.
the
government's
position
is
that
the
first
amendment
allows
the
banning
of
a
book
if
it's
published
by
a
corporation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
they
had
done
either
of
the
things
you
just
mentioned,
putting
it
on
its
web
site
or
putting
it
on
youtube,
your
position
would
be
that
the
constitution
would
permit
the
prohibition
of
that
during
the
period
prior
to
the
primary
or
the
election?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
the
constitution
--
if
--
if
bcra
--
if
congress
in
the
next
act
covered
that
in
light
of
advances
in
the
internet,
would
the
constitution
permit
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
mr.
olson,
do
you
think
that
media
corporations
that
are
owned
or
principally
owned
by
foreign
shareholders
have
less
first
amendment
rights
than
other
media
corporations
in
the
united
states?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
with
respect
to
that
what
is
your
answer
to
the
argument
that
more
than
half
the
states,
including
california
and
oregon,
virginia,
washington
state,
delaware,
maryland,
a
great
many
others,
permit
independent
corporate
expenditures
for
just
these
purposes?
now
have
they
all
been
overwhelmed
by
corruption?
a
lot
of
money
is
spent
on
elections
in
california;
has
--
is
there
a
record
that
the
corporations
have
corrupted
the
political
process
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
the
particular
--
what
if
the
particular
movie
involved
here
had
not
been
distributed
by
video
on
demand?
suppose
that
people
could
view
it
for
free
on
netflix
over
the
internet?
suppose
that
free
dvds
were
passed
out.
suppose
people
could
attend
the
movie
for
free
in
a
movie
theater;
suppose
the
exact
text
of
this
was
distributed
in
a
printed
form.
in
light
of
your
retraction,
i
have
no
idea
where
the
government
would
draw
the
line
with
respect
to
the
medium
that
could
be
prohibited.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
could
they?
which
of
them
could
and
which
could
not?
i
understand
you
to
say
books
could
not.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
waxman,
all
of
this
talk
about
100
years
and
50
years
is
perplexing.
it
sounds
like
the
sort
of
sound
bites
that
you
hear
on
tv.
the
--
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
only
cases
that
are
being
--
that
may
possibly
be
reconsidered
are
mcconnell
and
austin.
and
they
don't
go
back
50
years,
and
they
don't
go
back
100
years.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
my
point
is
that
there
is
nothing
unusual
whatsoever
about
a
case
in
which
a
party
before
the
court
says,
my
constitutional
rights
were
violated,
and
there
is
no
prior
decision
of
this
court
holding
that
what
was
done
is
constitutional.
and
in
that
situation
is
it
an
answer
to
that
argument
that
this
has
never
been
challenged
before?
the
court
has
never
held
that
it
was
unconstitutional?
it
has
been
accepted
up
until
this
point
by
the
general
public
that
this
is
--
that
this
is
constitutional?
no,
that
is
not
regarded
as
an
answer
to
that
question.
