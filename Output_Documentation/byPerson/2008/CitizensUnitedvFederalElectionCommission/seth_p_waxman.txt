mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
requirement
that
corporations
fund
electoral
advocacy
the
same
way
individuals
do,
that
is
with
money
voluntarily
committed
by
people
associated
with
the
corporation,
is
grounded
in
interests
that
are
so
compelling
that
52
years
ago,
before
buckley
was
decided,
before
feca
was
enacted,
before
buckley-style
quid
pro
quo
corruption
was
ever
addressed,
this
court
explained
that,
quote:
"what
is
involved
here
is
the
integrity
of
our
electoral
process
and
not
less
the
responsibility
of
the
individual
citizen
for
the
successful
functioning
of
that
process.
"
if
the
court
now
wishes
to
reconsider
the
existence
and
extent
of
the
interests
that
underlie
that
sentiment
expressed
for
the
court
by
justice
frankfurter
in
the
context
of
a
prosecution
of
union
officials
for
running
television
ads
supporting
political
candidates,
it
should
do
so
in
a
case
in
which
those
interests
are
forthrightly
challenged
with
a
proper
and
full
record
below.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
don't
recall
who
the
professor
was
either,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
do
recall
pretty
well
the
history
that
was
recounted
--
i
would
say
the
history
that
was
recounted
by
this
court
in
the
auto
workers
case,
in
cio,
in
the
pipefitters
case,
which
is
quite
inconsistent
with
that.
we've
never
had
this
case
--
until
this
court's
supplemental
order,
we
never
had
a
case
that
challenged
directly,
quote,
"austin"
and
austin-style
corruption,
which
is
a
term
i
think
that
is
quite
misleading.
when
the
sober-minded
elihu
root
was
moved
to
stand
up
in
1894
and
urged
the
people
of
the
united
states,
and
urged
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
to
enact
legislation
that
would
address,
quote,
"a
constantly
growing
evil
which
has
done
more
to
shake
the
confidence
of
plain
people
of
small
means
of
this
country
in
our
political
institutions
than
any
practice
which
has
ever
obtained
since
the
founding
of
our
government.
"
he
was
not
engaging
in
a
high
level
discussion
about
political
philosophy.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
he
--
with
all
due
respect,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
distinction
whatsoever
in
that
time
between
the
distinction
that
this
court
came
to
understand
as
a
result
of
feca,
and
its
adjudication
of
feca
and
that
--
really
the
prehistory
of
taft-hartley,
between
contributions
expenditures.
for
this
reason,
justice
kennedy,
was
that
what
root
said
was
the
idea
--
and
i
am
quoting
now
from
his
speech
which
is
also
partly
reprinted
in
this
court's
opinion
in
mcconnell
--
the
idea
is
to
prevent
the
great
companies,
the
great
aggregations
of
wealth
from
using
corporate
funds
directly
or
indirectly
to
send
members
of
the
legislature
to
these
halls
in
order
to
vote
for
their
protection
and
the
advancement
of
their
interests
as
against
those
of
the
public.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
scalia,
i
take
your
point
and
i
think
you
have
made
this
point
forceful
lily
many
times
before.
a
unanimous
court
in
national
right
to
work
committee
concluded
that
congress
was
entitled
to
make
the
judgment
that
it
would
treat
in
order
to
address
this
root
evil,
a
problem
of
such
concern
that
it
goes
to
the
very
foundation
of
the
democratic
republican
exercise,
that
is,
the
notion
of
integrity
in
representative
government.
now
this
--
this
case,
of
course,
is
not
a
case--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
and
justice
scalia,
if
a
small
corporation
or
even
any
corporation
of
any
sort
wants
to
bring
an
as-applied
challenge
to
441b
or
a
state
law
analogue
and
say,
you
know,
i
am
not
the
problem
that
theodore
roosevelt
and
elihu
root
was
addressed
at;
there
isn't
a
compelling
interest
because
i
only
have
three
employees
and
$8,000
in
my
bank
account,
that's
fine.
but
what
is
extraordinary,
truly
extraordinary,
given
the
sentiments
that
underlay
the
tillman
act
and
the
taft-hartley
act
is
that
we
would
be
having
a
discussion
today
about
the
constitutionality
of
a
law
that
has
been
on
the
books
forever
when
no
party,
no
corporation,
has
ever
raised
the
challenge.
i
well
recall--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
kennedy,
first
of
all,
i
--
i
think
it
is
actually
true
that
patents
are
owned
by
individuals
and
not
corporations.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
there
is
no
doubt
--
i
am
not
here
saying
that
this
court
should
reconsider
bellotti
on
first
principles
any
more
than
i
am
saying
that
it
shouldn't
consider
austin
on
first
principles.
corporations
can
and
do
speak
about
a
wide
range
of
public
policy
issues,
and
since
the
controlling
opinion
was
issued
in
wisconsin
right
to
life,
the
--
the
kind
of
campaign-related
speech
that
corporations
can't
engage
in,
in
the
pre-election
period
is
limited
to
the
functional
equivalent
of
expressed
advocacy
and
nothing
else.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
my
point
here
is,
justice
alito
--
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
--
to
be
demeaning
this
court
with
sound
bites.
the
point
is
that
what
--
austin
was,
to
be
sure,
the
very
first
case
in
which
this
court
had
to
decide
--
actually
had
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
prohibition
on
corporate
treasury
funded
campaign
speech
could
properly
be
limited
and
was
supporting
by
a
compelling
interest.
all
i
am
suggesting
--
and
i
hope
that
if
you
take
nothing
else
from
my
advocacy
today
it
will
be
this
--
is
that
we
have
here
a
case
in
which
the
court
has
asked
a
question
that
essentially
goes
to
the
bona
fides,
that
is,
the
factual
predicates
of
the
interests
that
have
been
viewed
as
compelling
in
austin,
in
mcfl,
in
mcconnell
itself,
whether
you
call
it
the
corrosive
effect
of
corporate
wealth,
whether
you
call
it,
quote,
"shareholder
protection"--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--mr.
olson
is
--
was
quite
right
--
either
mr.
olson
or
mr.
abrams,
i
find
it
so
difficult
to
tell
the
two
apart.
one
of
them
was
saying,
well,
it's,
you
know
--
yes,
i
think
in
response
to
justice
sotomayor's
question,
you
know,
about
there
is
no
factual
record
here.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
case.
and
the
response
was,
well,
it's
the
government's
burden.
the
government
has
to
prove
that
any
restriction
that
it
imposes
passes
strict
scrutiny.
fair
enough,
but
the
question
has
to
be
raised.
the
issue
has
to
be
raised.
if
the
--
if
austin,
justice
alito,
or
the
compelling
interests
that
austin
and
mcconnell
relied
on
were
forthrightly
challenged
in
a
case,
the
government
would
have
the
option--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
that's
because
the
ultimate
--
i
assume
i
have
your
permission
to
answer.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
--
the
only
challenges
that
were
litigated
in
the
district
court
--
and
they
largely
were
related
to
disclosure
--
were
very
direct
as-applied
challenges
that
had
--
that
did
nothing
whatsoever
to
implicate
the
foundation
of
mcconnell
or
austin.
and
all
i'm
saying
is,
if
you
want
to
reexamine
the
predicates,
the
existence
and
magnitude
of
interests
that
congress
has,
going
back
a
--
whether
it's
60
years
or
100
years,
and
courts,
whether
it
has
been
the
actual
rationale
of
the
decision
or
a
predicate
of
the
rationale
of
the
decision,
you
ought
to
do
it
in
a
case
where
the
--
where
the
issue
is
squarely
presented
so
that
the
government
can
do
what
it
did
in
mcconnell
and
in
another
context
in
michigan
v.
grutter
when
it
suggested
that
aderand
had
undermined
this
court's
controlling
opinion
in
bakke.
thank
you.
