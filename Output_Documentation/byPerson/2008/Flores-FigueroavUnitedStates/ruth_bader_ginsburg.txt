justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
russell,
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
government
goes
with
you
almost
all
the
way,
and
its
only
the
last
three
words,
"of
another
person",
that
--
they
agree
"knowingly"
applies
to
"without
lawful
authority"
and
that
it
applies
to
"a
means
of
identification"?
you
have
to
know
that
it
what
you're
using
is
a
means
of
identification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
first
--
this
alien's
first
effort
to
get
papers
that
would
qualify
for
him,
if
i
--
if
i
remember
correctly,
the
first
time
around
he
used
an
assumed
name,
not
his
own
name.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
used
a
false
date
of
birth.
he
got
a
social
security
card
that
happened
to
belong
--
to
be
the
number
of
no
live
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
--
and
that
would
not
have
violated.
even
in
the
government's
reading,
that
would
not
have
violated--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
statute.
but
the
second
time
around,
your
case,
he
did
use
his
own
name.
and
the
question
was
--
and
it
turned
out
that
both
the
social
security
card
and
the
alien
registration,
they
were
two
different
people,
but
they
were
both
alive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
does
make
it
a
crime.
but
when
the
number
turned
out
to
be
--
not
belong
to
anybody,
then
it's
not
--
you
don't
get
the
two-year
add-on?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not
--
that's
not
this
case.
in
this
case,
he
had
his
own
name.
and
i
don't
know
whether
there
was
a
picture
on
the
alien
registration
card.
i
don't
know
if
he
--
he
used
his
own
name.
did
he
use
his
own
photograph?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
do
these
operations
work?
when
he
went
to
chicago
to
buy
false
identification
papers,
did
the
first
time
--
did
he
go
to
the
same
outfit
as
the
time
he
used
a
false
name?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
these
are--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--these
are
outfits
that
specialize
in
making
false
identifications?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
any
sense
of
--
because
there
are
many
people
with
false
identification
papers
--
how
many
times
it
turns
out
to
be
the
number
of
a
live
person,
and
how
many
times
it
turns
out
like
it
was
in
the
first
instance
in
this
case:
it's
just
a
number,
a
made-up
number
that
doesn't
belong
to
anybody?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
government's
argument
in
this
case
that
congress
was
really
going
after
people
who
have
false
identifications
because
of
its
concern
to
protect
the
victim,
that
is,
the
person
whose
number
is
misused?
so
the
government
is
urging
that
we
take
a
victim-centered
approach
to
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
--
this
conduct
would
amount
to
identity
--
what
did
it
say
--
is
there
a
crime
of
identity
fraud?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
be
equally
false
if
the
social
security
number
were
fictitious
--
it
didn't
belong
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
heytens,
did
the
prosecutor
give
the
right
answer
to
judge
friedman
in
the
district
court
when
judge
friedman
asked:
where
i
take
two
people
and
one
of
them
gets
a
false
social
security
card
and
it
happens
that
the
number
belongs
to
no
live
person,
and
another
person
goes
to
the
same
outfit,
but
the
card
that
he
gets
does
belong
to
a
live
person
--
he
doesn't
know
in
either
case
--
did
the
prosecutor
give
the
right
answer
when
he
said,
when
it
turns
out
to
be
a
fictitious
number,
no
two-year
add-on;
but
if
it
turns
out
to
be
a
real
number,
two
years'
mandatory
addition?
the
prosecutor
said,
yes,
that's
the
difference.
was
that
the
right
answer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the
--
the
even
division
--
i
think
it's
an
even
division,
3/3
--
is
it
a
3/3
split?
and
if
you
wanted
one
indication
that
this
statute
is
indeed
grievously
ambiguous,
is
that
that
good
minds
have
reached
opposite
conclusions
with
well-reasoned
decisions
on
both
sides.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
very
strong
argument
that
this
is
an
ambiguous
statute,
unusually
so.
and
i
factor
into
that
the
answer
that
was
given
to
judge
friedman's
question,
which
astonished
me
the
first
time
i
read
it:
that
a
prosecutor
would
say,
yes,
the
same
--
no
different
degree
of
culpability.
one
happened
to
get
a
fictitious
number;
the
other
happened
to
get
a
real
number.
two
years
for
the
second
one.
there
is
no
difference
at
all
in
the
state
of
mind
of
--
of
the
two
defendants.
that's
--
that's
why
i
think
the
--
the
ambiguity
argument
is
strong.
why
in
the
world
would
congress
want
to
draw
such
a
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
--
you
gave
earlier
the
felony
murder
example
of
the
one
who
--
the
gun
goes
off,
he
didn't
mean
to
kill
anybody.
but
i
thought
homicide
is
--
it's
an
answer
to
your
argument
that
this
statute
is
entirely
victim-centered,
because
a
person
is
just
as
dead
if
he's
the
victim
of
a
reckless
driver
as
a
premeditated
murder,
and
yet
we
certainly
distinguish
the
penalties
in
those
cases,
no
matter
that
the
harm
was
identical.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
aren't
too
many
15-year-olds
who
look
like
they're
over
21?
