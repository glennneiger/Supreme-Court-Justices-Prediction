justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
so
what
if
it
isn't?
i
mean,
suppose
you
had
a
statute,
and
the
statute
says
it
is
a
crime
to
mug
a
man
from
denver.
that's
a
denver
ordinance,
by
the
way
----
[laughter]
--because
no
one
else
would
pass
it.
but
i
mean,
if
those
are
the
elements
of
the
crime,
i
guess,
we
do
normally
apply
"knowingly"
to
each
of
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whether
--
even
if
it
isn't
ordinary
usage.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
slightly
trying
to
push
you
on
to
the
next
argument.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
because
that's
what
we
normally
bring
into
sentencing.
i
mean,
normally,
in
that
we
don't
impose
mandatory
--
we
impose
mandatory
sentences
when
the
person
does
something,
you
know,
that's
wrong
and
he
knows
it's
wrong.
when
--
when
harm
occurs,
and
the
harm
wasn't
known
or
intended,
you
can
take
care
of
it
if
you
are
a
judge.
you
increase
the
sentence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not
just
says
"means
of
identification",
then?
i
mean,
it's
odd
to
write
a
statute
that
has
elements
and
you
put
the
word
"knowingly",
and
the
"knowingly"
is
supposed
to
modify
some
elements
but
not
others.
i
can't
think
of
other
statutes
that
do
that.
there
may
be
some.
it's
pretty
peculiar.
you
could
have
left
off
the
last
element.
i
mean,
if
you
are
drafting
a
criminal
statute,
anyone
would
know
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
give
me
one
where
what
they've
done
is
they
have
used
"knowingly"
at
the
beginning,
and
there
are
four
elements
of
the
crime,
and
--
i'm
not
saying
there
are
none,
but
i'd
like
to
know
what
they
are
where
"knowingly"
doesn't
modify
something
there
is
strict
liability
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
going
to
be
jurisdictional
--
probably
jurisdictional
hooks,
like
hobbs
act,
and
there
could
be
--
there
could
be
some.
but
i
don't
see
--
you
tell
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
do
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--even
that
isn't
--
i
mean,
here
you're
treating
it
as
if
it
is
a
separate
thing.
that's
fair
enough.
and
what
are
the
words
"of
another
person"
doing
there
if
really
they
are
not
supposed
to
make
any
difference
in
terms
of
mental
state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
that
is
true,
and
that's
actually
where
i
was
going.
it
--
it
seems
to
me
where
the
ambiguity
is
precisely
is
that
none
of
us
doubts,
i
don't
think,
that
what
congress
is
after
with
this
extra
two-year
mandatory
is
identity
theft.
and
where
the
argument
lies
is
between,
did
congress
do
this
by
punishing
people
only
who
intend
to
engage
in
identity
theft
or
people
who,
while
not
intending
to
do
so,
have
that
effect?
that's
the
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
don't
think
i
can
resolve
that
one
way
or
the
other
from
anything
you
have
said.
it's
rather
hard
to
say.
so,
therefore,
suppose
i
use
the
rule
of
lenity
this
way,
which
i
am
trying
out,
i'm
not
buying
it:
in
the
case
of
mandatory-minimum
sentences,
there
is
a
particularly
strong
argument
for
a
rule
of
lenity
with
bite.
and
that
is
because
mandatory
minimums,
given
the
human
condition,
inevitably
throw
some
people
into
the
box
who
shouldn't
be
there.
and
if
this
person
should
be
there
and
we
put
him
outside,
the
judge
could
give
him
the
same
sentence
anyway.
so
the
harm
by
mistakenly
throwing
a
person
outside
the
box
through
the
rule
of
lenity
to
the
government
is
small.
the
harm
to
the
individual
by
wrongly
throwing
him
into
the
box
is
great.
the
rule
of
lenity
is,
therefore,
limited
to
a
very
small
subset
of
cases
where
it
has
particular
force,
but
this
is
one
of
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i
raised
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
federal
statute
entitled
aggravated
identity
theft
makes
it
a
crime
to
--
the
language
support
in
here,
â€œknowingly
transfer,
posses,
or
use
without
lawful
authority
a
means
of
identification
of
another
person"
during
or
in
relation
to
some
other
crime
and
it
increases
the
penalty
imposed
upon
a
person
who
for
example
uses
fraudulent
documents
in
that
particular
way.
the
petitioner,
ignacio
flores-figueroa
gave
his
employer
a
false
social
security
card
and
other
counterfeit
documents
that
contained
his
name,
but
an
identification
number
that
belong
to
another
person.
the
question
before
us
is
whether
the
statute
requires
the
government
to
prove
that
flores-figueroa
knew
that
the
numbers
belong
to
another
person.
and
we
conclude
that
it
does.
to
understand
why
that
so,
it's
necessary
to
look
at
the
statute,
it
starts
with
the
word,
"knowingly"
followed
by
verb
such
as
"transfer"
followed
by
an
object,
namely
a
means
of
identification
of
another
person.
in
most
context,
listeners
take
the
use
of
a
simple
english
sentence
constructed
in
this
way
to
mean
that
knowingly
modifies
a
verb's
object.
if
i
tell
you,
john
knowingly
ate
a
blt
sandwich,
we
assume
that
john
knew
that
what
he
ate,
namely
a
sandwich
contained
bacons,
lettuce,
and
tomato.
if
i
tell
you
only
--
without
using
the
word
"knowingly",
john
sent
the
bank
draft
to
the
capital
of
honduras.
you
think
john
may
or
may
not
know
the
name
of
that
capital
city.
but
if
i
tell
you
john
knowingly
did
so,
it
is
more
likely
that
i'm
telling
you
that
john
also
knows
the
name
of
the
capital
of
honduras
which
happens
to
be
tegucigalpa
which
not
too
many
people
know.
now,
what
is
true
in
life
is
true
in
law.
ordinarily,
we
read
the
word,
"knowingly"
in
a
criminal
statute
as
modifying
the
object
that
follows.
at
least
in
the
absence
of
special
circumstances
and
there
are
no
special
circumstances
here.
to
the
contrary,
the
statute
imposes
its
extra
punishment
not
upon
counterfeiting
or
fraud
but
upon
identity
theft.
and
it
is
natural
to
read
such
a
statute
as
insisting
that
the
government
show
that
the
defendant
knew
that
he
was
stealing
somebody's
identity.
thus,
we
hold
that
the
government
must
show
that
flores-figueroa
knew
that
the
false
means
of
identification
he
gave
his
employer
were
those
of
another
person.
for
these
reasons
and
others
more
fully
explained
in
our
opinion,
we
all
reverse
an
eighth
circuit
determination
to
the
contrary
and
we
remand
the
case.
