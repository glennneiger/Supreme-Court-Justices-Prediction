would
it
be
enough
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
hypothetical
justice
alito
gives
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
agree
that
you
could
go
to
the
jury
whenever
there
is
an
identity
card
that
does
reflect
the
identity
of
a
real
person
but
there's
no
other
knowledge
that
the
government's
case
has
introduced
that
shows
--
there's
no
other
evidence
that
the
government
has
introduced
showing
knowledge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
i
had
five
different
cards
with
five
different
real
people.
would
that
be
enough
to
go?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
no.
the
fact
that
he
testifies
--
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
case
would
go
to
the
jury.
does
the
government
make
its
case
sufficient
to
resist
a
motion
--
a
directed
motion
for
acquittal
if
it
just
puts
in
the
fact
that
you
have
five
identity
cards
and
there
are
five
different
people
that
are
all
real
people?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
you
have
to
have
the
further
inference
that
he
knows
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
going
to
be
my
next
question.
so
the
next
question
is,
suppose
it's
the
petitioner's
own
name
but
somebody
else's
number.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
if
he
had
five
different
cards,
all
with
his
name,
but
all
with
the
identification
numbers
of
other
real
people?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
he
have
to
know
it's
that
--
but
suppose
he
uses
john
smith.
does
it
suffice
that
--
do
you
have
to
show
that
he
knows
there
is
a
john
smith
in
the
phone
book,
someplace
in
the
united
states?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
want
an
answer
to
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
can't
be
submitted
to
the
jury
on
the
ground
that
anybody
knows
there's
a
john
smith?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
--
can
it
go
to
the
jury
without
any
other
evidence,
other
than
the
fact
of
his
possessing
the
card?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you
say
this
goes
to
the
jury,
it
doesn't
leave
very
much
to
your
knowledge
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i
suppose
that
defense
counsel
could
get
up
and
say,
the
government
hasn't
shown
that
he
knew
this.
and
then
the
government
says,
of
course,
he
knows
this.
i
don't
think
you
have
accomplished
very
much.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
a
clear
statute.
what
--
what
if
the
accused
knowingly
uses
a
card
--
identity
belonging
to
a
dead
person?
is
that
a
real
person?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
your
view?
