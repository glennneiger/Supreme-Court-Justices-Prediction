well,
it
does,
though,
in
a
way,
because
i
understand
your
theory
is
there
are
two
basic
kinds
of
crimes.
you
just
use
the
document
for
your
own
source
if
you
want
to
get
the
job
or
you
want
entry
into
the
country
or
something
like
that.
that's
a
minor
crime.
but
if
you
are
--
it's
identity
theft
where
you
are
pretending
to
be
somebody
else
so
you
can
get
advantage
of
his
credit
and
his
assets
and
his
access
to
computers.
that's
a
much
more
serious
crime.
now,
if
it's
a
dead
person,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
in
the
former
category,
rather
than
in
the
latter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
heytens,
this
raises
the
question
i
was
talking
to
your
opponent
about.
do
you
think
that
congress
intended
there
to
be
a
more
severe
punishment
for
somebody
who
really
steals
another
person's
--
knowingly
steals
somebody
else's
identity
so
he
can
cash
in
on
his
credit
and
so
forth?
it
seems
to
me,
arguably,
that's
the
important
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
legislative
history
deal
with
people
who
are
stealing
identities
of
people
who
have
been
--
or
bilking
identities?
i
think
that
legislative
history
cuts
the
other
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
reason
for
that
is
it's
an
equally
culpable
act
where
you
steal
something
off
of
a
field
as
in
morissette.
i
agree
the
morissette
case
supports
you,
even
though
they
relied
on
it,
which
is
interesting
to
me.
but
that's
a
--
you
are
distinguishing
between
two
equally
culpable
acts.
it
doesn't
even
make
any
difference
whether
he
knows
the
owner
was
some
private
farmer
or
the
united
states.
in
this
case,
you've
got
two
really
big
categories
of
different
crimes,
and
to
say
they
are
treated
alike
is
the
thing
that
troubles
me
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
this
particular
case,
if
you
talk
about
identity
theft,
it's
inconceivable
that
the
defendant
would
not
know
about
fact
that
there's
another
person
involved.
and
so
the
--
the
mens
rea
issue
is
easy
in
this
case.
the
only
time
it's
--
it's
difficult
is
when
he
didn't
--
when
he
did
not
use
it
for
an
identity-theft
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
those
are
the
category
of
cases
in
which
congress
wanted
to
have
a
more
severe
penalty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
any
of
those
cases
did
they
talk
about
unknowing
identity
theft?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
won't
convince
justice
scalia
of
this,
but
you
might
convince
me.
[laughter]
