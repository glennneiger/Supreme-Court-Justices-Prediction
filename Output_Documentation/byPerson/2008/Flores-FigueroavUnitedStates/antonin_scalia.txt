justice
antonin
scalia
he
says
he
knowingly
stole
the
car
that
belonged
to
mr.
jones.
wouldn't
that
be
the
parallel?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
left
out
the
"knowingly".
justice
antonin
scalia
once
you
put
in
"knowingly"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
are
making
it
very
hard
for
me
to
vote
with
you,
i
must
say.
i
----
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
had
a
pretty
good
--
a
pretty
good
case,
but
if
you
are
going
to
say
somebody
who
has
five
identity
cards,
faces
of
individuals
--
i
mean,
presumably
they
are
real
individuals.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
--
that
was
the
hypothetical.
five
different
--
a
person
has
five
identity
cards
of
real
people,
and
--
and
you
don't
know
that
he
knows
that
it's
the
identity
card
of
a
real
person,
but
he
used
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'll
tell
you
what
cuts
one
way
or
another.
i
--
i
find
it
--
i
find
it,
well,
not
surprising
because
i've
heard
--
i've
heard
the
government
do
it
before.
you
acknowledge
that
this
is
an
ambiguous
statute.
that
--
that
on
its
face,
it
--
it
could
mean
the
one
thing
or
the
other.
i
would
normally
conclude
from
that
that
we
apply
the
rule
of
lenity.
since
it
could
go
either
way,
let's
assume
that
the
defendant
gets
the
--
you
know,
the
tie
goes
to
the
defendant.
why
--
why
shouldn't
i
resolve
it
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
have
to
rename
it
the
rule
of,
you
know,
who
gets
hurt
the
most
or
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
lenity.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
in
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
not
say
congress,
then.
does
--
does
the
committee?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
also
say
you
get
two
years
for
knowing
that
there
is
a
discrete
victim.
i
mean
--
i
--
you
can
describe
it
either
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
makes
sense
either
way.
