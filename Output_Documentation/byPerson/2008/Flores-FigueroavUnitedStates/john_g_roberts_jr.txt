chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-108,
flores-figueroa
v.
united
states.
mr.
russell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
about
so
and
so
stole
the
car
that
belonged
to
mr.
jones?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
--
that
the
person
knew
it
was
mr.
jones's
car,
but
more
likely
somebody
stole
the
car
that
turned
out
to
be
mr.
jones's.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
but
that's
--
that
doesn't
help
you
much
because
it
can't
be
"knowingly
manufacture"
something
is
the
crime.
i
mean,
you
do
have
to
go
on
to
have
that
make
any
sense.
you
don't
have
to
go
on
to
make
your
provision
make
any
sense,
that
he
knowingly,
you
know,
uses
a
means
of
identification.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
guess
maybe
this
was
what
i
was
trying
to
say
earlier
as
well.
i
mean,
you
have
in
your
statute,
in
between
there,
the
modifier
"without
lawful
authority".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
means
that
it
can
stop
at
a
lot
more
number
of
earlier
places
than
can
the
statute
that
you
were
just
citing
in
appendix
d.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
russell.
mr.
heytens.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
i
think
--
i
thought
that
argument
cut
against
you,
because
what
you
are
saying
is
everybody
is
on
the
hook.
there's
a
basic
problem
here,
which
is
--
i'll
call
"identity
fraud"
--
and
yet
you
get
an
extra
two
years
if
it
just
so
happens
that
the
number
you
picked
out
of
the
air
belongs
to
somebody
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
should
--
should
it
--
is
it
time
to
revisit
the
court's
decision
in
hayes?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
in
that
case,
you
tell
them,
look,
the
person's
got
10
years.
right?
i
mean,
if
they
find
the
guy,
he's
going
to
face
up
to
10
years
for
identity
fraud.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
problem
with
that
is
the
statute
says
"identity
theft";
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
victims.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
four
minutes,
mr.
russell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-108,
flores-figueroa
versus
united
states.
