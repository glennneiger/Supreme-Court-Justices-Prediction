mr.
kevin
k.
russell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
common
usage,
to
say
that
somebody
knowingly
transfers,
possesses,
or
uses
something
is
to
say
that
that
person
knows
what
it
is
that
he
is
transferring,
possessing,
or
using.
if
i
say
that
john
knowingly
used
a
pair
of
scissors
of
his
mother,
i
am
saying
not
simply
that
john
knew
that
he
was
using
something
which
turned
out
to
be
his
mother's
scissors
or
even
that
john
knew
he
was
using
scissors
which
turned
out
to
be
his
mother's,
i
am
saying
that
john
knew
that
the
scissors
he
was
using
belonged
to
his
mother.
the
same
principle
follows
under
the
federal
aggravated
identity
theft
statute,
which
calls
for
a
two-year
mandatory
sentence
for
anyone
who,
during
and
in
relation
certain
predicate
offenses--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
haven't
been
able
to
think
of
one.
the
government
hasn't
been
able
to
come
up
with
one.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
do
think
that
that
formulation
gives
rise
to
a
little
bit
more
ambiguity
in
that
context.
i
think,
though,
if
you
said
"stole
the
car
of
mr.
jones.
"
it's
--
it's
not
particularly
ambiguous.
at
the
very
least,
this
is
a
formulation
that
i
think--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--yes,
i'm
sorry
if
i
left
that
part
out.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
yes.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think
if
the
statement
is,
you
know,
john
knowingly
stole
the
car
of
mr.
jones,
that
strongly
implies
that
john
knew
that
the
car
belonged
to
mr.
jones.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
do
think
that
the
formulation
that
john
knowingly
stole
the
car
of
mr.
jones
most
naturally
is
understood
to
imply
that
john
knew
whose
car
it
was
he
was
stealing.
we
don't
claim
that
the
government's
interpretation
is
grammatically
impossible.
we
are
just
simply
saying
that,
by
far
the
most
common
usage
of
this
kind
of
formulation,
particularly
in
a
criminal
statute,
is
that
the
knowledge
element
applies
to
the--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
that
that's
a
more
ambiguous
statement.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
because
i
think
the
"from"
preposition--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
the
possessive
form
makes
it,
through
common
usage,
unambiguous.
we
don't
claim
that
it's
grammatically
impossible.
but
we
do
think
that
in
ordinary
usage
people
would
understand
that--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--that
--
that
is
correct.
in
the
criminal--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--that's
right.
we
have
more
than
one
argument.
we
think
that
as
a
matter
of
ordinary
usage--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
we
do
think
that,
in
a
criminal
statute,
you
ordinarily
assume
--
this
court
has
said
that
a
conventional
mens
rea
element
extends
to
all
of
the
elements
of
the
offense.
and
congress
knows
how
to
deviate
from
that
when
it
wants
to.
it
did
so,
for
example,
in
the
statute
that
the
court
construed
in
the
x-citement
video
case,
where
it
referred
to
a
person
"knowingly"
transporting
a
visual
depiction,
comma,
"if"
that
visual
depiction
had
certain
characteristics.
and
this
court
recognized
that
that
kind
of
formulation
most
naturally
is
read
to
end
the
knowledge
requirement
at
the
"comma,
if".
congress
didn't
do
that
here.
in
fact,
there
is
no
textual
indication
that
would
lead
one
to
believe
that
the
--
it
intended
anything
other
than
a
completely
conventional
mens
rea
requirement
in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
not
their
position.
that's
the
back-up
to
their
back-up
position.
the
first
position
is
that
it
only
applies
to
the
verbs,
and
then
they
say,
well,
if
you
don't
accept
that,
well,
maybe
it
goes
through
"without
lawful
authority".
and
if
you
don't
accept
that,
then
maybe
then
it
goes
halfway
through
the
phrase
"means
of
identification
of
another
person.
"
so,
they
do
raise
all
three
alternatives.
that
last
argument,
i
think,
fails
both
for
text
--
common
usage
reasons
and
in
light
of
this
tradition
that
we've
been
discussing.
textually,
there
is
simply
no
textual
cue
that
the
knowledge
requirement
stops
halfway
through
the
direct-object
phrase,
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
correct.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
correct.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
just
to
be
clear,
the
only
reason
the
government
alleges
that
there
is
a
crime
here
is
because
it
turned
out
that
those
numbers
had
been
assigned
to
somebody
else.
under
our
view,
that's
not
enough.
that's
enough
to
show
that
he
committed
the
predicate
offenses,
and
he
received
very
substantial
punishment
for
that,
but
it's
not
enough
to
show
that
he
was
qualified
for
an
additional
two
years'
mandatory
sentence
as
an
aggravated
identity
thief.
now,
you
can--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--ordinarily,
recklessness
doesn't
satisfy
a
knowledge
requirement.
willful
blindness
ordinarily
does.
but
recklessness
in
itself
ordinarily
does
not.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think
so.
the
government
is
free
to
present
circumstantial
evidence.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
if
there's
--
i
think
that
could
be
a
component
of
a
circumstantial
evidence
case.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
enough,
particularly
in
a
case
like
this,
where--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
don't
think
so
in
itself.
precisely
--
particularly
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the
person
gets
up
and
testifies
that
they
didn't
know.
the
fact
that
there's
these
numbers
here--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
and
in
fact,
the
fact
that
there
are
five
different
people
probably
tends
to
undermine
the
evidence.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i'm
sorry.
i
may
be
misunderstanding
the
hypothetical--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--okay.
if
they
--
these
are
identity
cards
that
have
the
picture
of
somebody
other
than
him
on
them--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--which
is
an
unusual
thing--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--to
try
to
use,
but
if
that's
the
case,
then,
yes,
i
think
that
--
you
know,
that
if
there
would
be
--
affirms
that
that
picture
belongs
to
the
person
whose
number
is
there,
then
they
could
do
that.
the
ordinary--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
that
a
jury
could
reasonably
infer
that
the
person
wouldn't
--
would
know,
that
if
you
have
an
id
card
with
somebody
else's
name,
somebody
else's
number,
somebody
else's
picture,
that
that
belongs
to
somebody
else.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
mean,
social
security
cards
don't
have
pictures.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
would
tend
to
think
that
that's
not
sufficient.
of
course--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--again,
i
would
think
not.
i
can
understand
that
people
could
disagree
with
that.
and,
of
course,
the
government
is
free
to
raise
those
kinds
of
arguments
in
other
cases
where
this
comes
up.
all
of
this
goes
the
question
of
what
does
it
take
to
show
that
somebody
knows
something.
the
question
before
the
court
right
now,
and
the
only
question,
is
whether
the
government
has
to
show
that
knowledge
at
all.
and
in
this
case,
you
know,
the
government's
principal
argument,
i
think,
their
strongest
argument,
is
that
reducing
the
mens
rea
requirement
in
that
way
serves
the
purpose
of
facilitating
prosecutions
and
therefore
protection
of
victims.
and
we
don't
deny
that
it
has
that
effect.
and
we
don't
deny
that
this
statute
is
directed
at
protecting
victims,
but
that
could
be
said
of
an
awful
lot
of
criminal
statutes.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--again,
you
have
this
issue
of
recklessness
versus
knowledge.
if
he
knew
that
in
fact
it
belonged
to
--
if
he
used
john
doe
--
and,
in
fact,
it
turns
out
there
are
several
hundred
john
doe's
in
this
country,
and
it
does
raise
a
difficult
question
about
how
this
statute
ought
to
apply
when
you
are
using
something
that
is
so
commonly
identifying
somebody,
but
it's
hard
to
say
that
it's
identifying
anybody
in
particular.
the
definition
of
"means
of
identification"
in
the
statute
says
it
has
to
be
a
name
or
number
that
is
capable
of
identifying
a
specific
person.
and
so
i
think
you
get
into
questions,
when
you're
talking
about
common
names,
about
how
the
statute
--
whether
the
statute
would
be
satisfied
in
that
respect.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
you
would
have
to
show
that
he
knew
that
that
was
a
name
belonging
to
a
specific
person.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
he
would
have
to
know
that
there
is
such
--
he
wouldn't
have
to
know
me,
but
he
would
have
to
know
that
there
is
such
a
person.
but
again--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
so.
i
don't
think
he'd
have
to
know
who
that
john
smith
was,
but
he'd
have
to
know
there
is
a
john
smith.
and
that
--
i
mean,
that
kind
of
scenario
does
raise
difficult
questions
about--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
i
think
the
answer
is
the
one
that
i
gave
you,
which
i
think
is
disputable,
but
it's
--
the
answer
is
yes,
he
has
to
know
that
there
is
a
specific
person
named
john
smith.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--if
it's
a
sufficiently
common
name
that
he
ought
to
know
that
there
is
somebody
bearing
that
name,
then
yes,
i
would
agree
that
it
could
go
to
the
jury
on
that.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
--
again
--
it's
hard
to
draw
lines
here,
but
i
think
the
ultimate
question
is,
you
know,
could
a
reasonable
jury
think
that
somebody
using
that
name
has
to
know
that
there
is
a
person
with
that
name,
a
specific
person
with
that
name?
and
quite
possibly
they
could.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
an
awful
lot
of
name
examples
would.
i
think
simply
in
this
case,
though,
when
you
are
talking
about
a
number
--
i
don't
think
--
it's
a
much
harder
case
to
say
that
simply
having
a
number
on
a
card
should
--
should
lead
you
to
know
that
that
name
very
likely
belongs
to
somebody
else.
in
fact,
there
are
nine
--
there
are
--
there
a
billion
possible
combinations
for
security
--
social
security
numbers,
and
only
about
400
million
have
been
issued.
but
to
get
back
--
i--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
it
--
i
think
the
jury
still
has
to
make
the
finding
that
he
knew
it.
and
in
a
case
like
this,
where
my
client
testified
that
he
didn't
know
it,
where
the
government
didn't
contest
that,
didn't
argue
that
there
were
circumstantial
evidence
showing
that
he
did
know
it,
it's
going
to
be
outcome-determinative.
in
that--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--the
record
doesn't
disclose
that,
and
i
don't
know.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
again,
the
record
doesn't
disclose
how
sophisticated
the
operation
was.
in
this
case,
it
could
just
be,
you
know,
a
guy
who
does
this;
it
could
be
a
very
sophisticated
operation.
i
think
it's
kind
of
all
over
the
place
out
there,
in
the
real
world.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i'm
afraid
i
don't
have
a
good
sense
of
that.
but
just
to
be
clear,
in
addition
to
being
able
to
just
say
on
the
face
of
the
fact
about
the
identification
that
the
government
can
present
circumstantial
evidence
to
the
jury,
in
a
great
number
of
cases,
particularly
the
kinds
that
congress
was
most
concerned
about,
the
way
that
they
--
the
defendant
obtained
the
identification
and
the
way
that
they
used
it
provides
powerful
circumstantial
evidence
of
knowledge.
somebody
who
breaks
into
a
computer
system
or
unauthorizedly
uses
access
to
a
computer
system
or
goes
dumpster
diving
looking
for
ids
obviously
knows
that
they
are
going
to
end
up
with
an
id
that
belongs
to
another
person.
and
if
they
use
the
id
to
try
to
get
into
a
real
person's
bank
account,
then
it's
awfully
good
information
that
they
were
aware
that
that
was
an
id
that
belonged
to
another
person,
because
there's
no
sense
in
trying
to
break
into
the
bank
account
of
a
nonexistent
person.
and
so
we
don't
think
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
government
faces
some
kind
of
insurmountable
burden
in
proving
knowledge
in
a
way
that's
particularly
different
than
--
than
other
kinds
of
situations
in
which
the
law
commonly
requires
the
government
to
prove
what
a
defendant
knew
or
didn't
know.
to
get
back
to
the
victim-focused
nature
of
this,
you
know,
congress
could
--
we
don't
dispute
that
congress
could
make
a
policy
judgment
that
it
would
be
good
to
hold
defendants
strictly
liable
when
they
used
an
identification
that
turns
out
to
belong
to
somebody
else.
sometimes
the
law
does
that,
most
commonly
with
respect
to
sentencing
enhancement
provisions
of
the
sort
that
the
government
points
to
with
respect
to
drug
quantity
or
selling
drugs
in
a
school
zone.
but
when
congress
makes
that
choice,
congress
makes
that
clear
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
and
so
if
you
look
at
the
drug
quantity
or
the
school
zone
provisions,
which
are
in
appendix
e
and
d
of
the
--
of
the
yellow
brief
appendix,
in
appendix
d
you
see
that
congress
establishes
in
subsection
(a)
of
that
provision
the
"unlawful
act",
and
it
says
it's
unlawful
for
any
person
"knowingly
to
manufacture,
distribute",
et
cetera,
a
controlled
substance.
it
includes
in
that
provision
a
knowledge
requirement,
which,
by
the
way,
nobody
thinks
means
only
that
the
government
has
to
show
that
they
knowingly
manufactured
something
which
turned
out
to
be
a
controlled
substance.
everybody
agrees
that
the
knowledge
requirement
in
that
position
extends
to
the
direct
object
phrase,
"controlled
substance".
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
disagree
as
matter
of
common
usage.
but
i
think
when
congress
intends
to
have
a
statute
read
that
way
or
writes
a
statute
that
looks
like
this
one,
which
in
subsection
(b)
lays
out
the
facts
that
are
aggravating,
that
they
are
going
to
punish
separately,
the
drug
quantity
in
subsection
(b)
of
21
u.s.c.
841--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--that's
right.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
to
answer
that
question
--
and
then
i'd
like
to
return
to
the
school
zone
example
--
the
fact
that
congress
put
in
"without
lawful
authority"
and
enclosed
it
with
commas
i
think
simply
reflects
that
congress
understood
that,
by
inserting
that
phrase
between
transitive
verbs
and
the
direct
object,
it
was
interrupting
the
natural
flow
of
the
sentence.
and
i
don't
think
it
means
--
so
the
first
comma
may
tell
the
reader
to
pause,
but
the
second
comma
i
think
just
as
clearly
indicates
to
the
reader
that
the
flow
of
the
sentence
continues.
and
so
that
i
don't
think
you
would
say
a
sentence
that
says,
john
knowingly
used
without
permission
a
pair
of
scissors
of
his
mother's.
you
would
still
read
that
to
mean
that
john
knew
that
the
scissors
he
was
using
belonged
to
his
mother.
that
the
insertion
of
the
parenthetical,
i
think,
indicates
that
congress
knew
it
could
put
it
at
the
end
and
not
change
the
meaning
or
put
it
here.
but
when
congress
intends
to
write
a
statute
that
--
that
holds
people
strictly
liable
for
aggravating
circumstances
or
writes
something
like
the
federal
quantity
provisions
where,
in
subsection
(b),
congress
sets
out
the
punishment
that
is
deserving
because
of
that
aggravating
factor,
and
it
does
not
include
a
mens
rea
requirement
in
subsection
(b).
and
in
the
school
zone
provision,
congress
likewise
has
no
mens
rea
requirement
with
respect
to
the
knowledge
of
the
person
being
in
a
school
zone.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
do
think
it's
a
fair
point,
that
this
is
a
statute
that's
concerned
with
victims.
lots
of
criminal
statutes
are.
but
we
don't
ordinarily
read
it
--
congress
doesn't
ordinarily
enact
even
victim-focused
statutes
without
mens
rea
requirements,
and
courts
don't
ordinarily
narrowly
construe
them,
even
though
it's
true
that
omitting
mens
rea
requirements
or
narrowly
construing
them
furthers
the
purpose
of
protecting
victims.
in
fact,
by
far
more
--
far
more
commonly,
as
the
lafave
treatise
that
we
cite
to
you
explains,
we
don't
hold
defendants
criminally
strictly
liable
for
all
of
the
consequences
of
their
crimes.
it
gives
the
example
of
somebody
who
breaks
into
a
house
intending
to
rob
it
and
accidentally
sets
it
on
fire
--
you
know,
they're
engaged
in
unlawful
conduct
to
start
with
and
so
they're
not
fully
blameless,
but
nonetheless
we
don't
hold
them
criminally
liable
for
arson
because
they
didn't
intend
it.
now,
congress
could
make
a
different
choice.
congress
could
choose
to
hold
that
arsonist
strictly
liable
--
or
the
robbery
suspect
strictly
liable
for
the
arson,
just
as
congress
could
hold
defendants
like
petitioner
strictly
liable
for
the
fact
that
he
ends
up
using
an
identification
that
belongs
to
somebody
else.
but
our
point
is
simply
there
are
reasons
why
congress
might
not
do
that,
including
the
anomalous
kind
of
penalties
that
end
up
being
meted
out
here,
where
you
have
people
--
two
people
with
identical
culpability
ending
up
with
substantially
different
punishments,
or
people
with
substantially
different
culpability
ending
up
with
identical
punishments.
if
you
have
the
classic
aggravated
identity
thief
who
breaks
into
a
bank
account
using
a
means
of
identification
he
knows
belongs
to
somebody
else,
it's
exactly
the
same
sentence,
under
the
government's
view,
as
somebody
like
petitioner
who
just
unknowingly
used
a
number
in
order
to
get
a
job.
now,
it's
not
impossible
that
congress
could
make
that
policy
choice,
but
when
it
does,
it
tends
to
write
statutes
that
look
very
different
than
this.
it
writes
ones
that
look
like
the
quantity
statute
that
i
just
cited
or
the
school
zone
statute.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think
that's
an
open
question
in
the
circuits.
some
circuits
have
said
that
it
has
to
be
a
means
of
identification
belonging
to
a
living
person,
but
that's
--
that's
not
settled.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
my
view
--
i
mean,
the
statute
says
"of
another
person".
i
think
you
would
ordinarily
presume
that
to
mean
a
live
person.
but
ultimately,
i
guess,
it
really
doesn't
matter
to
the
outcome
of
my
case.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
true.
certainly,
using
the
identification
of
a
dead
person
doesn't
impose
the
kind
of
harms
on
real
victims
that
congress
seemed
to
be
most
focused
on
in
this
case.
and
certainly,
our
interpretation
of
the
statute
we
don't
think
unduly
interferes
with
that
protective
function,
precisely
because
the
government
ought
to,
in
a
great
many
cases,
very
easily
show
that
the
way
that
the
person
used
the
means
of
identification
shows
that
they
knew
that
it
belonged
to
somebody
else.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
that's
what
we
have
been
using
to
refer
to
the
underlying
predicate
offense
here,
which
is
the
misuse
of
the
immigration
document.
but
that's
--
that
applies
whenever
somebody
uses
an
immigration
document
--
and
there
is
another
statute
for
social
security
cards
--
that
doesn't
belong
to
them.
and
the
government
only
has
to
prove
that
they
knew
that
it
didn't
belong
them.
and
that
in
itself
is
a
substantial
protection
for
people
who
might
be
unknowing
victims
or
victims
of
somebody
like
my
client.
he
is
substantially
deterred
from
risking
their
credit
by
the
mere
fact
that
he
is
going
to
face
a
substantial
penalty
for
using
the
false
document
in
and
of
itself.
my
client's--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--didn't
belong
to
anybody.
that's
correct.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
address
just
a
couple
of
quick
questions
about
the
text,
and
then
address
a
couple
of
other
issues
about
the
purpose.
justice
breyer,
you
asked
if
there
were
examples
of
other
statutes
in
which
knowledge
requirements
didn't
extend
to
all
the
elements.
the
government
gave
two
examples.
the
first,
morissette,
is
clearly
an
example
with
a
jurisdictional
element.
all
of
the
circuit
courts
that
say
that
the
knowledge
requirement
doesn't
extend
to
"of
the
united
states"
do
so
on
the
grounds
that
it's
because
there's
a
jurisdictional
element,
and
jurisdictional
elements
don't
extend
--
don't
require
mens
rea.
with
respect
to
the
chin
example,
i
do
acknowledge
that
there
--
there
is
a
decision
that
this
court
hasn't
reviewed
in
which
the
d.c.
circuit
said
it
doesn't
extend
to
the
age
of
the
victim.
that
falls
within
a
category
of
special
cases
where
courts
have
treated
the
victimization
of
children
differently,
in
part
because
it's
so
difficult
and
nearly
impossible
to
prove
the
defendant's
knowledge
of
the
age
of
the
victim.
that
kind
of
practical
barrier
simply
doesn't
exist
here
for
all
the
reasons
we've
discussed
earlier
about
the
government's
ability
to
rely
on
circumstantial
evidence
to
show
the
defendant's
state
of
mind
here.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
right.
[laughter]
with
respect
to
the
victim-focused
nature
of
this,
again,
it's
true
that
--
that
the
criminal
law
takes
into
account
both
defendant
culpability
and
harm
to
victims,
but
the
ordinary
resolution
is
to
reserve
punishment
in
the
criminal
system
for
those
who
intend
the
harms
that
they
inflict.
there
are,
of
course,
exceptions
like
felony
murder.
as
the
lafave
treatise
points
out,
that
kind
of
treatment
tends
to
be
reserved
for
serious
bodily
injury
or
death
kinds
of
harm.
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
thought,
although
identity
theft
is
serious,
that
this
fell
within
that
kind
of
category
of
exceptions.
there
are
of
course
these
other
exceptions
where
congress
relies
on
facts
not
known
to
the
defendant
for
sentencing
enhancement,
but
as
i've
mentioned
earlier,
it
tends
to
write
those
statutes
in
a
way
that
makes
clear
that
those
enhancement
factors
are
separate
and
apart
from
the
underlying
offense,
and
they
don't
include
an
express
mens
rea
requirement
there.
and
the
government
hasn't
cited
any
case,
any
statute
that
looks
like
this,
that
has
been
treated
as
a
sentencing
enhancement
provision.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
rule
of
lenity,
the
government
i
think
has
acknowledged
that
the
statutory
text
is
at
least
ambiguous
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
it
compels
their
conclusion.
they've
acknowledged
that
you
can
make
policy
arguments
both
ways
about
what
would
be
a
good
idea
about
how
to
treat
this
kind
of
conduct.
and
i
think,
regardless
of
your
view
of
what
the
trigger
of
the
rule
of
lenity
is,
this
is
a
classic
case
for
it.
if
congress
intended
the
government's
interpretation,
the
government
is
free
to
go
back
to
congress,
and
there's
every
reason
to
believe
that
congress
would
be
receptive.
the
problem
with
overconstruing
a
mandatory
sentence
or
a
mandatory
minimum,
as
justice
breyer
was
alluding
to,
is
that
it
does
have
this
particularly
harsh
effect,
and
one
that
is,
as
a
practical
matter,
hard
to
undo
in
the
legislative
process,
which
as
the
court
has
recognized,
is
another
function
served
by
the
rule
of
lenity.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
