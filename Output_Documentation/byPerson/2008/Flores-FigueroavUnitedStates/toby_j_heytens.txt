mr.
toby
j.
heytens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
common
ground
that
there
are
at
least
three
preconditions
to
liability
under
18
u.s.c.
section
1028a(a)(1):
first
and
foremost,
the
defendant
must
commit
one
of
the
separate
predicate
felonies
that
are
specifically
enumerated
in
subsection
(c).
second,
during
the
commission
of
that
felony,
the
defendant
must
use
something
that
is
in
fact
a
means
of
identification
of
another
person.
and,
third,
that
use
of
the
means
of
identification
of
another
person
must
itself
be
without
lawful
authority
and
must
have
the
effect
of
facilitating
the
defendant's
commission
of
the
underlying
predicate
felony.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
government
must
also
show
that
the
defendant
was
specifically
aware
that
the
means
of
identification
that
he
uses
to
facilitate
his
underlying
crime
was
that
of
another
person.
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
yes,
it
was.
if
i
could
explain,
the
first
--
the
reason
that
the
first
defendant
is
not
guilty,
is
that
it
is
an
absolute
precondition
for
liability
under
this
statute
that
the
means
of
identification
in
question
be
that
of
another
person.
so
there
are
no
victimless
violations
of
1028(a)(1),
because
if
we
are
having
this
conversation
at
all,
there
was
a
real
victim
involved
in
the
case.
the
reason
the
second
individual
is--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--justice
alito,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
relates
to
the
definition
of
4a.
that's
18
u.s.c.
1028(d)(7).
the
definition
of
"means
of
identification"
means
"any
name
or
number
that
may
be
used,
alone
or
in
conjunction,
to
identify
a
specific
individual.
"
and
we
understand
that,
especially
in
conjunction
with
the
words
1028a(a)(1),
that
we
have
to
be
talking
about
a
real
individual.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
justice
stevens,
i
agree
that
a
person
who
deliberately
sets
out
to
misappropriate
the
identity
of
a
known
individual
is
almost
certainly
more
culpable
than
someone
who
does
not
do
it
but
inadvertently
does
so.
but
i
don't
think
that
is
controlling
in
this
case
for
a
very
important
reason,
and
the
very
important
reason
--
again,
to
go
back
to
what
i
said
at
the
outset
--
is
we
are
not
having
this
conversation
unless
the
defendant
has
already
committed
a
predicate
felony,
and
he
is
subject
to
punishment
for
that
predicate
felony.
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
predicate
felony
subjected
mr.
flores-figueroa
to
a
term
of
up
to
10
years
of
imprisonment,
above
and
beyond
the
2
years.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
i
understand
how,
from
the
defendant's
perspective
--
to
use
the
justice
--
the
example
that
justice
ginsburg
used
as
well,
but
it
may
seem
from
the
defendant's
perspective
that
he
just
so
happened
to
take
a
real
person's
number.
but
i
think
the
critical
fact
here
is
that
it's
not
seen
that
way
from
the
perspective
of
the
real
individual
whose
number
he
ended
up
using.
and
i
think
that's
the
critically
important
fact.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
well,
justice--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--justice
breyer,
my
answer
to
your
question
will
probably
be
only
of
interest
to
those
members
of
the
court
who
find
legislative
history
probative,
but
i
think
for
those
who
do,
the
very
significant
answer
to
that
is
that
the
one
thing
the
legislative
history
makes
very
clear
is
that
at
least
some
members
of
congress
believed
that
judicially
discretionary
sentences
before
this
statute
were
enacted
were
failing
to
adequately
take
into
account
the
harm
suffered
by
real
victims.
there's
very
clear
legislative
history
to
that
effect.
the
statement
that
just
leaving
it
up
to
the
judge
to
take
into
account
the
impact
of--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--i
certainly
agree,
justice
stevens.
there's
a
portion
of
the
house
report
that
lists
nine
specific
cases
in
which
congress
--
or
some
members
of
congress
with
the
people
authored
the
report
--
made
the
judgment
that
people
who
had
engage
in
the
sort
of
conduct
that
congress
wanted
to
reach
had
received
short
sentences
under
the
previous
regime.
there
are
nine
specific
examples
given
in
the
house
report.
i
acknowledge
freely
that
eight
of
those
nine
examples
very
clearly,
by
the
description,
involve
individuals
who
must
have
known
that
they
were
using--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--there
are
two
responses
to
that,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
congress
has
written
in
some
statutes
that
clearly
presuppose
that
"knowingly"
doesn't
go
all
the
way
through,
because
they
repeat
the
knowingly
requirement
in
those
statutes.
for
example
--
and
it's
the
appendix
to
the
reply,
appendix
g,
at
page
23a
of
the
appendix
to
the
reply
brief,
that
reproduces
18
u.s.c.
922(q)(2)(a),
which
is
a
statute
that
repeats
a
knowingly
requirement
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
which
under
petitioner's
argument
doesn't
make
any
sense
at
all,
because
you
would
just
construe
"knowingly"--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--sure.
i'll
give
you
two--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--i'll
give
you
two.
there's
the
statute
that's
at
issue
before
this
court
in
morissette
v.
united
states,
and
there's
the
statute
that
was
construed
by
the
d.c.
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
justice
ginsburg,
in
united
states
v.
chin.
the
statute
at
issue
in
morissette
says,
"knowingly
converts
to
his
use
anything
of
value
of
the
united
states.
"
in
morissette,
this
court
held
the
defendant
had
to
have
knowledge
of
the
facts
sufficient
to
make
his
conduct
a
conversion.
he
has
to
know
that
the
property
has
an
owner,
that
it's
not
abandoned,
and
he
has
to
know
that
the
owner
is
not
him.
but
the
lower
courts
have
uniformly
held
that,
under
that
statute,
the
defendant
does
not
need
to
know
that
the
property
in
question
belongs
to
the
united
states.
or
take
the
chin
statute.
the
chin
statute
says
18
to
avoid
detection
of
a
drug
trafficking
crime.
in
chin,
the
d.c.
circuit
said
--
and
every
other
court
of
appeals
to
have
considered
the
question
has
said
--
the
defendant
does
not
need
to
be
specifically
aware
that
the
individual
in
question
is
less
than
18
years
old.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
justice
stevens,
i
agree
that
mr.
morissette's
culpability,
or
the
hypothetical
defendant
in
standpoint
of
mr.
morissette,
doesn't
really
depend
on
whether
he
knows
the
property
belongs
to
the
federal
government
or
he
thinks
he
is
stealing
from
his
neighbor.
he
is
a
bad
person
either
way.
i
don't
think
that's
true
of
the
chin
statute,
though.
i
think
we
make
a
very
strong
argument
that
someone
who
deliberately
employs
someone
that
he
has--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--sure.
under
this
statute,
i
think
the
significance
is,
first
and
foremost,
we
are
not
having
this
discussion
unless
he
has
already
committed
an
underlying
predicate
felony.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
what
they
are
doing
there
is
--
this
goes
back
to
my
point
that
this
is
a
victim-focused
statute.
what
they
are
doing
there
is
to
say,
this
statute
does
not
apply
unless
the
name
or
number
in
question
is
actually
that
of
a
specific
individual.
take
the--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--we
don't
concede
that
the
text
of
the
statute
alone
unambiguously
resolves
the
issue
in
our
favor--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--justice
souter,
i
--
i
think,
as
i
said
before,
we
do
not
contend
that
this
statutory
text
standing
along
unambiguously
supports
our
position
and
thus
terminates
the
inquiry.
and
i
certainly
agree
that
the
purpose
is
an
important
part
of
our
argument.
i
think
there
are
two
important
things
to
just
unpack
briefly
--
two
of
the
things
you
said
there.
once
you
extend
"knowingly"
to
--
i
think
the
significance
is
with
the
effect
of
once
you
extend
"knowingly",
first
to
"lawful
authority"
and
then
to
the
"use
of
identification".
once
you
extend
it
to
"without
lawful
authority",
any
conceivable
argument
that
the
other
side
can
have
about
criminalizing
innocent
or
inadvertent
conduct
disappears,
because
then
at
that
point
the
defendant
knows
specifically
that
he
is
acting
in
manner
that
is
contrary
to
law.
and
then,
second,
if--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--i
think
--
i
think
it
is.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
well,
i
think,
first
of
all,
at
that
point
the
defendant
already
has
two
different
culpable
states
of
mind:
he
has
the
culpable
state
of
mind
to
commit
the
underlying
felony,
and
he
has
the
culpable
state
of
mind
with
regard
to
his
crime.
now,
i
agree
with
you,
justice
souter,
there's
arguments
you
can
make
both
ways
as
a
matter
of
policy.
i
think,
though,
some
of
the
colloquies
with
my
colleague
on
the
other
side
illustrate
why
congress
would
have
made
the
decision
it
did,
and
it's
all
of
those
cases
where
the
defendant
is
reckless,
where
the
defendant
is
willfully
ignorant,
or
the
defendant
simply
doesn't
know
because
he--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--it's
certainly
true
that
congress--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--i
certainly
agree
there
are
other
ways
that
congress
could
have
written
the
statute
to
make
it
clear.
but
i
think
it
--
they
could
have
written
the
statute
in
a
way
that
would
be
more
clear,
both
that
would
resolve
the
case
in
favor
of
petitioner
and
that
would
resolve
the
case
in
favor
of
us.
so
i
don't
know
how
that
cuts
either
way.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
well,
under
the
rule
of
lenity,
justice
scalia,
the
tie
does
go
to
the
defendant.
but,
as
the
court
has
made
clear
again
and
again,
including
in
its
opinion
in
hayes
yesterday,
the
fact
that
the
statutory
text
has
a
certain
amount
of
ambiguity
isn't
"off
to
the
races"
we
trigger
the
rule
of
lenity.
the
rule
of
lenity--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--the
court
--
what
the
court
said
yesterday
in
hayes
is
precisely
what
it
had
said
before
in
muscarello.
the
rule
of
lenity
comes
into
play
at
the
end
of
the
process
of
statutory
interpretation,
after
you
consider
text,
purpose,
legislative
history,
and
all
other--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--i
think
that
is
the
effect.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
justice
breyer,
i
--
i
guess
what
i
would
say
first
and
foremost
is
i
--
i
think
that
would
be
a
fairly
significant
reconceptualization
of
the
purpose
of
the
rule
of
lenity--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--right.
the
court
--
if
i
could
just
explain
why
i
think
that--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--the
rule
of
mandatory
minimums--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--the
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
the
two
purposes
of
the
rule
of
lenity
are
providing
fair
warning
to
people
before
their
conduct
subjects
them
to
criminal
punishment
and
to
demonstrate
a
proper
respect
for
the
lawmaking
powers
of
congress.
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
a
statute
imposes
a
mandatory
minimum
triggers
either
one
of
those
concerns
in
and
of
itself.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
well,
again,
if
i
could
--
there
are
several
things
there.
if
i
could
start
with
the
last
one,
why
would
congress
want
to
draw
such
a
line,
i
think
the
reason
congress
would
want
to
draw
such
a
line
is
for
several
reasons.
first
and
foremost
is
the
fundamentally
victim-focused
nature
of
this
statute.
and
i
--
i
agree
that,
at
least
on
first
blush,
that
judge
friedman
colloquy
does
strike
a
number
of
people
as
implausible.
but
i
think
if
you
step
back,
things
like
that
are
not
uncommon
throughout
the
criminal
law.
the
--
the
precise
same
objection
could
be
made
to
the
existence
of
the
felony-murder
rule.
two
people
go
out
to
engage
in
precisely
the
same
unlawful
course
of
conduct.
neither
one
of
them
wants
to
kill
anybody.
neither
one
of
them
wants
anyone
to
get
hurt.
in
one
of
them
the
gun
goes
off,
and
in
one
of
them
the
gun
doesn't
go
off.
and
one
of
them
is
now
guilty
of
felony
murder,
and
the
other
one
is
guilty
of
--
of
robbery,
which
is
admittedly
a
serious
crime
but
not
as
serious
of
a
crime
as
murder.
there
are
other
examples
of
that--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
i
think
i
--
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
i
think
there
are
certainly
many
cases
in
which
the
manner
in
which
the
defendant
uses
the
means
of
identification
will,
itself,
provide
powerful
circumstantial
evidence
that
he
knows
there
is,
in
fact,
another
person.
because
otherwise
the
actions
won't
make
any
sense.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
i
certainly
agree
that
those
are
at
least
some
of
the
category
of
cases.
i
--
what
i
guess
i
disagree
about
is
that
those
are
the
only
category
of
cases.
and
if
i
--
if
i
could
try
another
tack
on
that,
when
you
--
when
you
review
the
house
report,
the
legislative
history
that
talks
about
the
reason,
the
background
and
need
for
the
legislation,
congress
repeatedly
trots
out
a
great
many
statistics
about
the
number
of
people
who
are
victimized
by
identity
theft,
the
amount
of
dollar
harm
that
is
caused
to
people
and
businesses
by
identity
theft,
and--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--what
i
guess
i
am
saying,
justice
stevens,
is
in
none
of
those
cases
does
congress
--
when
it's
trotting
out
those
statistics
--
does
congress
distinguish
between
situations
in
which
the
victim
was
able
to
determine
whether
the
defendant
knew
that
he
existed.
i
mean--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--it
is
not
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
justice
scalia.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
the
committee
report,
i
apologize,
justice
scalia.
the
committee
report--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--fair
enough.
what
i'm
saying
is,
in
the
course
of
talking
about
the
harm
suffered
by
victims,
the
amount
of
harm,
in
the
course
of
talking
about
the
number
of
people
who
report
that
they
were
victims,
there
is
no
distinction
made
whatsoever
based
on
the
distinction
petitioner
would
like
to
draw.
and
i
think
there's
a
very
good,
practical
reason
for
that.
a
person
who
discovers
that
there
is
a
problem
with
their
social
security
number
having
been
misused,
for
example,
by
someone,
that
person
is
almost
certainly
not
going
to
be
able
to
figure
out
whether
the
person
who
used
their
social
security
number
knows
that
they
exist
or
not.
all
they
know
is
that
problems
are
now
showing
up
on
their
credit
report.
all
they
know
is
they
are
getting
questions
from
the
social
security
administration
about
this
earned
income
that
they,
you
know,
perhaps
haven't
paid
taxes
on,
for
example.
the
person
who
is
in
the
position
of
the
victim
is
not
well
positioned
to
determine
how
the
perpetrator
got
hold
of
their
identifying
information.
if
i
could
go
back--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--he's
going
to
face
up
to
10
years,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that's
the
important
thing.
i
think
congress
rationally
could
have
been
concerned
that
the
guy
is
not
actually
going
to
get
10
years
because
there
was
evidence
before
them
that
the
person
was
not
getting
10
years,
that
the
person
was
being,
at
least
in
the
judgment
of
some
people,
not
receiving
sufficient
punishment
to
reflect
that,
that
there
was
a
real
person
who
was
harmed
by
the
conduct
--
that
was
harmed
by
the
conduct
that
eventually
had
an
adverse
impact
on
him.
i
think
that
fundamentally
was
the
motivating
force
behind
the
statute,
the
need
to
have
a
statute
that
takes
adequate
and
discrete
account
for
the
presence
of
a
real
victim.
now,
the
petitioner,
for
example,
refers
to
the
statement
of
having
met
the
statute
--
excuse
me
--
as
having
a
mandatory
minimum.
it's
not
correct
to
say
the
statute
has
a
mandatory
minimum.
this
statute
has
a
mandatory,
discrete,
prescribed
punishment.
it's
not
two
years
up
to
something
else.
it's
two
years,
and
exactly
two
years.
and
i
think
that's
highly
significant.
because
i
think
what
it
says
is
that
congress
thought
there
was
a
discrete
measure
of
punishment
that
was
appropriate
to
reflect
the
presence
of
a
real
victim.
the
fact
that
there
is
a
real
victim
gets
you
two
years.
you
get
whatever
else
you
get
on
your
underlying
felony,
which
can
take
into
account
all
sorts
of
other
considerations
about
your
crime,
but
the
fact
that
there
was
a
discrete
victim
is
an
independent
harm
to
that
person
that
should
be
taken
into
account
in
imposing
criminal
punishment.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
you
certainly
can.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
you
certainly
can
describe
it
either
way,
but
i
think
in
light
of
the
concern
that
the
harms
to
real
victims
are
not
being
adequately
taken
into
account,
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
make
sense
to
make
the
presence
of
that
additional
punishment
turn
on
whether
the
defendant
is
specifically
aware
that
the
victim
existed,
and
i
think
at
the
end
of
the--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--we
certainly
do,
justice
ginsburg,
and
we
don't
make
the
extravagant
claim
that
law
doesn't
look
to
relative
moral
culpability
in
assigning
criminal
punishment.
i'm
responding
to
the
argument
on
the
other
side
that
that's
all
the
law
ever
looks
to.
the
law
frequently
looks
to
two
different
things:
it
looks
to
relative
culpability
levels,
but
it
also
looks
at
the
existence
of
harm.
if
you
want
to
continue
with
the
homicide
example,
if
you
look
at
moral
culpability,
two
people
who
both
intentionally
attempt
to
cause
the
death
of
another
human
being
without
any
legal
excuse
for
doing
so,
from
a
culpability
standpoint,
have
engaged
in
precisely
the
same
level
of
moral
wrong,
but
law
treats
attempted
murder
and
completed
murder
extremely
differently
from
one
another.
and
that's
because
in
one
case,
as
justice
ginsburg
points
out,
you
have
a
real
victim.
when
the
person
dies,
there
is
a
discrete
level
of
harm
to
the
victim
that
is
not
--
that
does
not
occur
when,
fortunately,
the
person
who
tries
to
kill
someone
else
fails.
and
i
think,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
that
is
the
most
important
issue
in
this
case.
you
see
this
argument
again
and
again
and
again,
especially
in
the
circuits
--
let
me
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
point
about
the
three
circuits
that
have
gone
either
way.
first,
as
a
--
as
just
a
threshold
matter,
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
the
fact
that
courts
have
disagreed
about
the
proper
interpretation
of
a
statute
doesn't
suffice
to
trigger
the
rule
of
lenity,
because
this
court
almost
never
takes
a
case
where
there
is
not
a
circuit
split.
and
if
you
said
the
existence
of
a
circuit
split
makes
the
statute
ambiguous
would
mean
that
the
criminal
defendant
wins
every
time;
and
the
court
has
not
said
that.
but
--
but
also
i
think
where
those
courts
have
fundamentally
gone
wrong
is
they
have
essentially
said,
this
is
a
crime
about
theft;
theft
requires
you
to
know
that
there's
a
real
owner;
if
you
don't
know
there's
a
real
owner,
that's
not
theft.
and
i
think
where
they
went
wrong
was
at
the
very
beginning.
where
they
went
wrong
at
the
very
beginning
is
asking
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
natural
to
refer
to
someone
like
petitioner
as
a
thief.
we
think
the
more
appropriate
question,
as
the
district
court
said
in
godin,
is
whether
it
would
be
at
all
unusual
to
refer
to
the
two
innocent
people
whose
social
security
number
and
alien
registration
numbers
petitioner
used
to
facilitate
his
two
underlying
felonies
were
the
victims
of
identity
theft.
if--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--it
certainty
does,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it
says
"identity
theft";
it
says
--
not
"theft",
and
i
think
the
question
is
whether
you
refer
to
those
people
as
having
had
--
if
identity
theft
occurred
in
this
case.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
victim's
perspective,
which
is
we
think
the
perspective
that
congress
was
looking
at
it
from,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
and
for
that
reason
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
