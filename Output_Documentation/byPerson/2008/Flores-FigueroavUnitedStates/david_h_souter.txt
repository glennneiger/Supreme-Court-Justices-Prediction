if

would
that
go

can
you
give
me
an
example?
it
go
to
the
jury,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
can
--
i
can
understand
your
argument
if
you're
saying,
look,
you
can't
tell
simply
from
the
text
what
the
answer
is.
you
can
only
tell
the
answer
if
you
say
--
know
what
the
answer
is
if
you
say
congress
had
victims
in
mind,
and
if
we
are
going
to
worry
about
victims,
we
are
not
going
to
worry
about
--
we
are
going
to
take
a
narrow,
rather
than
a
broad,
view
of
"knowingly".
is
that
your
position?
do
you
agree
that
if
you
simply
look
at
the
text
of
this
statute
without
considering
congressional
policy,
you
don't
win?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
does
it
--
does
it
even
come
close
to
supporting
it?
i
mean,
let's
start
out
with
your
narrowest
position.
your
narrowest
position
is
that
the
"knowingly"
simply
refers
to
the
--
the
--
the
three
acts
which
are
specified
by
which
the
identification
can
--
can
be
--
the
misidentification
can
be
perpetrated.
transfers,
possesses,
or
uses.
could
congress
possibly
have
said,
gee,
he
might
not
know
that
he
was
acting
to
transfer
or
to
possess
or
to
use?
that's
not
a
serious
possibility.
so,
"knowingly"
has
to
refer
to
something
more
than
the
three
possible
acts.
and
once
you
get
beyond
the
three
possible
acts,
and
you
say,
well,
we're
going
to
draw
the
line
between
"without
authority"
and
"another
person"
--
that
seems
like
an
arbitrary
line.
and
the
arbitrariness
of
the
line
seems
even
more
obvious
when
the
"without
lawful
authority"
is
set
off
as
a
parenthetical.
and
the
real
object
of
the
statute
--
the
real
--
the
operative
description
is
"a
means
of
identification
of
another
person.
"
that's
why,
it
seems
to
me
that,
if
you
look
at
the
text,
you
could
say,
well,
of
course,
the
"knowingly"
has
got
to
refer
to
everything
that
follows,
both
"lawful
authority"
and
"another
person".
and
that's
why,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you're
going
to
win,
you've
got
to
win
on
the
grounds
that
congress
wouldn't
have
meant
what
seems
so
natural,
because
congress
wanted
to
help
victims,
not
defendants.
where
am
i
going
wrong
there,
if
i'm
going
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
it
worth
two
years?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
thing
that
we
know
for
sure
is
that
congress
said
it's
not
worth
two
years'
extra
unless
that
of
another
person
was
involved.
and
if
that
is
what
is
so
significant
or
necessarily
significant
in
getting
a
two-year
add-on,
then
it
seems
reasonable
to
suppose
that
congress
thought
that
the
state
of
mind
had
to
touch
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
congress
has
got
to
do
is
to
say
"recklessly".
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
an
--
it's
an
accepted
term.
every
--
well,
almost
everybody
knows
what
it
means.
there's
a
model
penal
code
standard,
and
so
on.
all
they
have
to
do
is
put
the
word
"recklessly"
in
there.
it
would
cover
every
"knowingly"
case.
it
wouldn't
omit
anything
that
is
covered
by
this,
and
it
would
solve
precisely
that
problem.
and
they
didn't
do
it.
