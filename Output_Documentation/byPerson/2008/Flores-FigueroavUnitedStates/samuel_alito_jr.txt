a.
alito,

doesn't
that
depend
on
the
context?
you
could
think
of
examples
where
you
have
exactly
the
same
usage
and
the
person
wouldn't
necessarily
know
about
the
ownership
of
the
thing
in
question?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
repeat,
doesn't
that
depend
on
the
context?
you
say
--
somebody
says
to
you,
you
know
a
car
was
stolen
from
our
street
last
night?
oh,
what
car
was
stolen?
oh,
it
was
the
car
of
mr.
jones.
he
knowingly
stole
the
car
of
mr.
jones.
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
person
who
stole
the
car
knew
that
it
was
mr.
jones's
car.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
who
did
the
mugger
mug?
he
mugged
the
man
from
denver.
you
think
that
he
knowingly
mugged
the
man
from
denver.
you
think
that
means
that
the
mugger
knew
that
the
man
was
from
denver?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
it
more
ambiguous?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
it
less
unambiguous?
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
this
was
unambiguous.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
happen
if
the
--
the
defendant
doesn't
--
doesn't
act
knowingly
as
to
the
question
whether
the
identifying
information
belongs
to
a
real
person
but
is
simply
reckless
as
to
whether
the
identifying
information
belongs
to
a
real
person?
suppose
that
someone
buys
an
identification
card
and
looks
at
it,
and
it
looks
like
it
might
be
a
real
identification
card
on
which
that
person's
picture
has
been
inserted
in
place
of
the
real
picture,
but
the
person
can't
be
sure.
it
might
really
be
an
entirely
fake
card.
would
that
be
a
violation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
defendant
chooses
a
name
--
uses
a
name
other
than
his
or
her
own
name
--
gets
an
identification
card
made
up
with
that
--
and
doesn't
know
for
sure
that
the
name
that's
chosen
actually
belongs
to
another
person,
but
because
it's
not
an
extremely
uncommon
name,
has
--
knows
that
it's
virtually
certain
that
that
name
belongs
to
some
other
person
who
is
unknown
to
him?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
a
violation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
it's
not
an
extremely
common
name,
but
not
an
extremely
uncommon
name?
and
what
if
it's
--
what
if
the
defendant
chooses
kevin
k.
russell?
would
that
be
a
violation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
he
had
--
he
would
have
to
know
that
there
is
such
a
person?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
i
could
just
interrupt
you,
why
does
"of
another
individual"
--
why
can't
that
be
read
to
mean
"of
a
person
other
than
the
person
who
is
using
the
identification.
"
whether
this
other
person
is
real
or
not?
