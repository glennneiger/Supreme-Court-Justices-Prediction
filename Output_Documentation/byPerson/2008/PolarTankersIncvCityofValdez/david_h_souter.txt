justice
david
h.
souter
well,
some
--
some
of
those
vessels,
i
take
it,
are
taxed
under
other
statutes.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
--
do
you
take
the
position
--
let's
say
that
if
the
state
of
alaska
taxed
all
the
other
property
you
had
mentioned
except
for
the
tankers
and
the
city
taxed
the
tankers,
that
that
would
by
definition
be
a
discriminatory
tax
and/or
on
some
other
basis
violate
the
tonnage
clause?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
reason
i
raised
it
was
that
--
that
in
--
in
your
response
to
my
first
question,
you
said,
well,
you
didn't
think
the
city
was
taxing
these
other
--
these
other
pieces
of
property,
and
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
why
that
is
significant.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
about
the
risk
in
the
other
direction,
that
the
state
will
simply
take
over
this
tax
and
remit
the
proceeds
to
the
city?
would
the
result
on
your
view
be
the
same
if
it
did
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
--
let's
assume
that
you're
--
that
a
given
tanker
came
into
the
harbor
at
valdez
on
one
occasion
and
one
occasion
only.
would
the
city
of
valdez,
under
its
own
statutes,
by
the
terms
of
its
own
ordinance,
tax
that
ship?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
--
let
me
just
change
the
question
then.
if
--
if
it
came
in
and
sort
of
took
half
a
tankful
that
didn't
reach
the
point
of
a
million
dollars'
value,
there
would
be
no
tax
then.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
whatever
it
would
take
to
get
it
under
the
minimum.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
under
the
old
tonnage
laws,
wouldn't
that
ship
in
the
18th
century
have
been
taxed?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
--
the
point
that
i
am
getting
to
is
--
and
i'd
--
i'd
like
you
to
address
this:
one
of
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
is
that
one
reason
this
should
not
be
treated
as
a
tonnage
tax
is
that
it
relies
upon
the
concept
of
a
tax
situs.
and
the
--
the
implication
is
that
not
every
ship
that
comes
into
the
harbor
is
going
to
be
subject
to
the
tax;
whereas,
under
the
old
tonnage
laws,
any
ship
that
came
in
would
be.
and
what
is
--
what
is
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
where
do
we
--
where
do
we
look
to
find
this
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
know
of
any
source
that
we
could
look
at
to
support
the
proposition
that
you
just
made?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
thought
you
said
earlier
or
implied
earlier
that
we
couldn't
draw
a
distinction,
really,
between
capacity
and
value
because
tonnage
in
the
18th
century
was
simply
a
proxy
for
the
--
for
the
value
of
the
ship?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
a
value
tax
is
going
to
run
into
the
same
problem--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
a
tonnage
tax.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
all
you're
saying--
justice
david
h.
souter
--all
you're
saying
is
that
there
are
other
factors
that
--
that
preclude
using
tonnage
simply
as
a
single
crude
measure.
but
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that,
other
things
being
equal
--
the
engine
capacity,
the
hull
construction,
et
cetera
--
the
tonnage
is
a
rough
measurement
of
the
value
of
the
ship,
for
just
the
reason
that
justice
scalia
gave?
it
determines
the
amount
of
cargo
the
ship
can
carry,
and
what
it
can
charge
for
it,
and
that
is
capitalized
into
the
value
of
the
ship.
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
may
be
the
only
way
they
can
accomplish
what
they
want
to.
because
as
the
chief
justice's
question
suggested
a
moment
ago,
if
in
the
18th
century
the
port
of
boston
said,
we
are
not
going
to
charge
tonnage
anymore,
we
are
simply
going
to
tax
on
the
value
of
the
ship,
that
is
going
to
have
exactly
the
same
effect
that
a
tonnage
tax
would
have.
so
maybe
exemption
is
the
only
way
it
can
be
done.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
--
the
broader
tax
situation
at
the
--
at
the
--
in
--
in
1789?
did
--
did
ports
have
sources
of
--
or
exercise
the
authority
at
that
time
to
tax
property
generally,
e.g.,
real
estate
in
the
city
to
support
the
activities
of
the
ports,
or
were
they
dependent
solely
upon
things
like
import-export
taxes,
et
cetera?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
--
so
that
the
argument
they
are
taxing
other
things,
therefore
it's
okay
to
tax
this,
would
have
been
an
argument
just
as
potent
in
the
18th
century
or
impotent,
as
the
case
may
be,
as
it
is
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
