anthony
m.

it's
not
often
that
we
have
disagreements
as
to
the
basic
facts.
the
red
brief
says
that
the
tax
in
question
constitutes
11
percent
of
the
tax
base,
and
you
talk
about
that
in
the
reply
brief.
can
you
spend
just
a
little
bit
of
time
at
the
outset
telling
us
your
views
of
this
tax?
and
although
it's
the
respondent's
statement,
not
yours,
do
you
think
11
percent
of
the
tax
base
means
11
percent
of
what's
collected
under
this
tax
or
under
all
taxes
imposed
by
city
of
valdez?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
which
case,
that
seems
really
quite
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
you
understand
it,
with
reference
to
the
tax
base
referred
to
in
the
red
brief
at
page
14
where
it
says
it's
11
percent
of
the
tax
base,
is
that
tax
base
all
city-imposed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
says
vessels
of
all
kinds
are
liable
to
taxation
as
property
"in
the
same
manner
as
other
personal
property.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
your
answer
it
--
it
seems
to
me
does
put
the
issue
squarely
before
us
in
the
terms
that
the
petitioner
has
presented,
that
is
to
say,
sure,
suppose
you
tax
the
vessel
and
you
tax
trailers
and
small
vessels
and
a
lot
of
other
things,
but
as
to
all
of
the
latter
category,
you
have
--
you
have
an
exemption.
so
the
--
the
only
people
that
effectively
pay
the
tax
are
the
tankers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
thought
that
that
was
the
way
the
case
was
presented
to
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
the
question
is,
what's
imposed
here?
my
understanding
from
the
yellow
book
--
do
you
agree
that
the
yellow
brief
is
accurate
in
its
factual
descriptions,
perhaps
not
in
its
conclusions
that
it
draws?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
see,
we
have
a
problem
with
the
facts
here.
my
understanding
of
the
case,
and
please
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
is
that,
sure,
valdez
has
tax
authority
and
tax
statutes
which
would
cover
a
considerable
amount
of
personal
property
on
an
ad
valorem
basis.
but
because
of
exemptions,
only
the
tankers
pay
this
tax.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
my
statement
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
you
define
revenue
base?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
answer
to
justice
stevens's
question
is
we
can
take
this
case
as
presenting
to
us
the
fact
that
the
ships
pay
more
than
other
property?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
say
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
