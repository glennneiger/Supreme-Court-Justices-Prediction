justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you
--
you
want
us
to
ignore
the
--
the
state
tax.
do
you
really
want
us
to
do
that?
i
mean,
it
would
be
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
for
the
state
of
alaska,
instead
of
imposing
it
at
the
state
level,
to
authorize
the
municipality
to
do
it.
i
don't
want
to
have
this
case
to
come
back
here
for
a
second
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
--
now
that
the
municipality
is
imposing
the
taxes
that
the
state
used
to
impose,
don't
you
think
you
have
to
count
both
of
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
going
to
get
a
fragile
judgment
if
--
if
we
go
on
those
grounds.
all
it
takes
is
a
modification
of
the
--
of
the
legislation.
justice
antonin
scalia
including
a
--
a
cruise
ship
is
covered.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--was
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
that
if
there
is
a
tonnage
tax
imposed
on
everything
including
--
including
ships,
it
would
still
violate
the
tonnage
clause.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
my
--
it's
my
hypothetical.
i
made
it
up.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
it
would
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
only
discrimination
that
counts?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there's
some
--
there's
some
fight
about
that,
obviously.
there
--
there
is
no
fight
about
the
fact
that
this
tax
is
based
upon
how
long
the
ship
remains
in
port,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
how
many
days
it
remains
in
port.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means,
the
argument
could
go
that
this
is
obviously
a
--
a
tax
for
the
use
of
the
port.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
tonnage
clause
was
directed
against,
preventing
philadelphia
and
new
york
from
taxing
the
consumers
in
new
jersey
by
imposing
taxes
on
ships
that
bring
in
goods.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
think
a
daily
--
a
daily
charge
on
vessels
for
remaining
in
port
violates
the
tonnage
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
anything
else
than
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
felt
by
the
other
states,
felt
by
the
consumers
in
other
states.
ultimately,
it's
not
going
to
be
the
oil
companies
that
pay
this
tax;
it's
going
to
be
purchasers
of
oil.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
whom
are
going
to
be
outside
of
alaska,
since
this
oil
is
leaving
alaska,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
neat
tax,
you
know,
get
somebody
else
to
pay
your
taxes.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
fishing
ships,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
none
of
--
none
of
valdez's
fishermen
have
to
pay
this
tax
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
nonmobile
homes
are
not
taxed
as
real
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
was
all
other
personal
property
exempt
from
taxation.
they
didn't
have
a
personal
property
tax,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
nicely
targeted
as
well.
but
there
is
no
constitutional
impediment
to
--
to
targeting
the
people
of
new
jersey
through
taxing
the
oil
equipment.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can't
--
you
can't
make
vessels
bear
the
overall
burden
of
municipal
governance.
you
can
make
them
bear
the
burden
of
the
services
provided
to
them
in
harbor.
but
you
cannot
make
them
the
instrument
of
funding
all
other
municipal
services.
that's
what
the
tonnage
clause
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
counting
the
state
tax
as
well,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
counting
the
state
tax
on
oil
equipment?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute,
owed
to
the
state
for
what?
what
would
be
owed
to
the
state?
it's
still
a
state
tax,
and
they
are
the
collection
agent,
and
it's
a
--
a
credit
against
what
they
owe
for
their
collections,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what's
it
a
credit
against?
i
don't
understand
what
it's
a
credit
against.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
city
get
a
credit
against?
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
referred
to
in
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
i
thought
it
was
the
city
that
got
the
credit--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
--
for
a
commercial
vessel,
is
a
rough
calculation
of
how
much
it's
worth.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
more
cargo
you
can
carry,
the
more
valuable
the
commercial
ship.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
offended
them
aesthetically?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
the
state
has
to
say
is
we
are
not
--
we're
not
taxing
you
qua
vessel.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
olson--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let
me
ask
you
something
about
--
about
discrimination.
let's
assume
that
i
think
it
is
relevant
whether
the
tax
is
a
discriminatory
tax,
a
property
tax
just
levied
on
--
on
ships
or
not.
if
that
is
my
position,
why
should
i
count
as
establishing
nondiscrimination
the
fact
that
alaska
or
valdez
is
also
taxing
--
most
of
its
other
property
tax
revenue
comes
from
taxing
oil
equipment,
right?
and
the
burden
of
all
of
that
tax,
just
like
the
burden
of
this
vessel
tax,
is
paid
by
people
in
new
jersey.
i
mean,
you
know,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
getting
somebody
else
to
bear
the
burden
of
your
taxation.
justice
antonin
scalia
taxing
that
equipment
raises
the
price
of
oil,
almost
all
of
which
the
oil
goes
out
of
alaska
and
is
paid
for
by
people
in
other
states.
why
should
i
count
that
property
tax
as
proving
that
either
the
state
of
alaska
or
valdez
is
not
being
discriminatory?
just
because
it
--
it
can't
possibly
violate
the
--
the
tonnage
clause
doesn't
mean
that
it
isn't
as
much
discriminatory
against
other
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
no--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
if
--
if
california
taxed
vessels,
i
would
not
allow
california
to
come
in
and
say,
oh,
we
are
just
subjecting
them
to
the
same
tax
that
our
own
citizens
are
subjected
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
let
them
point
to
the
silicon
valley
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
all
it
applied
to,
then
the
wharfage
tax
would
have
been
perfectly
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
say
that
was--
