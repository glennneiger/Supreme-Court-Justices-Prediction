there
are
some
other
vessels,
too.
it's
the
--
it's
the
oil
tankers,
and
there
are
a
few
other
vessels
that
were
included?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
don't
dispute
that
in
light
of
the
benefits
provided
by
valdez
to
the
shipowners,
that
there
could
be
a
legitimate
tax
on
these
vessels?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
could
you
describe
what
tax
authority
you
think
valdez
has?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
much
property
--
you
said
if
they
--
if
they
taxed
all
moveables,
that
would
be
okay.
could
they
have
some
exemptions
and
still--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that's
--
the
train
is
going
to
be
some
place
throughout
its
trip,
unlike
the
ship
that's
going
to
be
on
the
high
seas.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
can
tax
for
the
time
on
the
high
seas?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
domicile
here
is
texas.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
either
case,
no
ships
berth
in
either
delaware
or
texas.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
home
port
might
have
had
in
the
old
days
the
notion
that's
really
where
the
vessel
is
berthed.
but,
nowadays,
delaware
has
very
little
to
do
with
where
the
vessels
are
berthing
and
where
they
are
being
serviced?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
people's
homes
only
if
they
are
affixed
to
the
property
and
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wheeling
--
wheeling
was
--
it
was
a
general
property
tax,
and
as
i
read
the
case,
it
said
if
you
are
going
to
tax
property,
you
can
include
vessels.
this
statute
--
and
i
think
the
alaska
supreme
court
treated
it
discretely
--
is
a
tax
on
one
kind
of
property
only,
these
vessels.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
property
tax
that
is
confined
to
just
one
type
of
property.
is
there
another?
is
there
a
comparable
tax
that
is
focused
on
a
single
category
of
property?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
it
--
do
you
--
do
you
contest
the
point
that
was
made
in
the
reply
brief
that,
back
at
the
end
of
the
18th
century,
tonnage
was
considered
a
proxy
for
value,
that
it
was
the
customary
mode
of
measuring
the
value
of
a
ship?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
as
long
as
you
are
taxing
on
the
basis
of
the
value
of
the
ship,
then
you
have
no
tonnage
clause
problem.
is
that
your
--
the
tonnage
clause
was
a
specific
type
of
measure,
and
if
you're
taxing
based
on
the
assessed
value
of
the
property,
it
isn't
a
tonnage
clause.
is
that
your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
we
have
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
olson,
we
--
we
have
said
it's
not
just
tonnage.
it
said
that
the
clause
bars
states,
we
said,
from
imposing
a
charge
even
if
not
measured
by
a
vessel's
tonnage,
for
the
privilege
of
entering,
trading
in,
or
lying
in
a
port.
so
we
have
ruled
out
the
position
that
it's
got
to
be
an
old-fashioned
tonnage
charge
and
can't
be
based
on
the
assessed
value
of
the
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
--
but
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
vessels
were
being
taxed
as
one
item
of
property
in
a
general
moveable
property,
personal
property
tax.
i
asked
you
before,
i
think,
is
there
any
other
tax
like
this,
that
--
an
ad
valorem
tax
that
is
applied
to
one
single
category
of
property?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
statute
deals
with
one
category
of
property.
is
there
another
statute
like
this
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
the
other
--
the
state
taxes
were
no
part
of
the
alaska
supreme
court's
decision
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
on
what
else?
in
that
--
in
that
tax
that
was
before
the
court,
what
else
did
wheeling
tax?
