justice
stephen
g.
breyer
may
i
ask
one
other
question
before
you
leave
this,
which
is
where
justice
kennedy
started?
suppose
a
state
says:
in
our
state,
we
want
to
tax
all
oil
and
gas
property,
and
here's
how
we
do
it.
we
assess
the
value
of
all
oil
and
gas
property,
ships
and
everything
else
included.
then
we
impose
a
tax
of
20
mills
per
dollar
of
assessed
value,
something
like
that,
on
all
of
it.
now,
the
state
will
collect
all
of
it,
and
we
make
one
exception.
we
define
which
property
the
state
will
directly
get
the
money
from,
and
then
the
city
can
do
the
rest,
if
it
wants.
now,
here's
what
we
do
with
the
state
money.
we
give
it
to
the
city.
so
if
the
city
wants
to,
it
can
put
the
same
tax
on
that
little
bit
of
property
left
over,
which
is
a
subcategory
of
oil
and
gas
property.
and
by
the
way,
the
name
of
that
little
bit
of
property
left
over
is
called
"a
ship".
now,
is
that
a
tonnage
tax,
and
is
that
what
alaska
has
done
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
described
to
you
the
entire
tax.
we
know
no
more
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
way
it
does
is
just
as
i
said.
and
maybe
i
was
--
it
was
too
much
for
you
to
take
in.
so
the
point
is
that
it's
a
tax
on
oil
and
gas
property.
that's
code
section
1.
code
section
2
is
defined
subcategories
--
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d,
(e),
(f)
--
all
of
that.
code
section
3
says
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d),
and
(e).
the
--
the
state
government
collects
and
remits
it
to
the
city.
(g),
the
city
can
assess
the
same
tax
if
it
wishes.
it
doesn't
have
to
--
and
keep
the
money.
(g)
is
ships.
and
the
reason
i
have
asked
that
question
is
i
read
something
from
--
alaska
department
of
economic
and
community
development
which
suggested
to
me
that
that
is
alaska's
tax.
i
might
have
that
wrong.
i
just
read
a
sentence
or
two,
and
maybe
i
am
wrong
that
that's
alaska's
tax,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
if
it's
alaska's
tax--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what's
wrong
with
it?
it's
a
--
it's
a
tax
on
all
oil
and
gas
property,
and
all
they
do
is
they
let
the
city
collect
some
of
that
if
they
want,
and
they
collect
the
rest
of
it
and
give
it
to
the
city.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'd
like
to
know
is:
do
you
think
what
i
said
was
a
misdescription?
what's
worrying
me
about
this
aspect
of
this
case
is
a
possible
need
to
send
it
back
to
find
out
what
alaska's
tax
system
is.
now
--
now,
if
what
i
just
said
is
a
--
is
a
correct
description
approximately
and
if
the
other
side
thinks
it
is,
too,
then
at
least
i
--
i
know
how
to
go
about
deciding
it.
and
if
i
don't,
i
don't
know
quite
what
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
different
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
we
just
get
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
makes
matters
worse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
--
let's
suppose
i
accept
just
what
justice
ginsburg
said,
and
said
that
it's
a
hopeless
morass
if
we
look
at
all
taxes.
let's
look
at
this
tax.
this
tax
you
call
an
ad
valorem
tax
on
personal
property
levied
by
valdez,
and
then
on
page
11
of
your
brief
you
say
that's
not
just
on
ships;
it's
also
on
mobile
homes,
trailers,
recreational
vehicles,
and
various
types
of
personal
property
defined
under
state
law
as
oil
and
gas
property,
motor
vehicles,
machinery,
supplies
and
maintenance
equipment.
they
come
back
and
they
say,
as
to
your
mobile
homes,
trailers,
and
recreational
vehicles,
all
that's
happening
there
is
either
you
have
exempted
them
or
they
are
fixed
in
place,
and
they
are
like
real
property,
and
that's
what
you
are
doing.
as
to
the
other
things,
you
do
not
impose
a
tax
on
those
other
things.
rather,
the
state
imposes
a
tax
on
those
other
things.
and
it
may
be
that
you
help
the
state
do
it
by
providing
them
with
the
assessment,
and
it
may
be
even
that
you
could
do
it,
but
you
haven't.
and,
therefore,
the
only
thing
you
have
imposed
this
tax
on
are
the
ships.
now,
i
think
i
have
that
argument
right.
if
i
do,
what's
the
answer
to
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
don't,
what's
the
right
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"may
impose"
doesn't
help
if
you
don't
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
state
imposes
it
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
that
happens
with
all
these
other
properties?
that
is,
in
valdez,
you
pay
the
city
--
you
pay
the
city
--
for
the
--
for
the
taxes
on
that
oil
and
gas
property
that
isn't
shipped?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
write
the
check
to
the
city.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
the
things
you
listed
on
page
11--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
--
the
oil
and
gas,
motor
vehicles,
machinery,
appliances,
supplies,
and
maintenance
equipment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
write
a
check
to
the
city.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
a
porthole
tax?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
a
porthole
tax
in
your
view
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
porthole
tax.
they
charge
for
portholes.
anyone
who
has
a
porthole
who
comes
into
our
city
pays
the
tax.
that's
not
a
tonnage
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
your
view,
a
masked
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
but
the
porthole
tax
applies,
by
the
way,
to
that
ship's
captain
who
has
retired,
who
has
built
his
house
with
portholes
instead
of
windows.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there
are
2
or
3
percent
of
the
--
i
mean,
it's
only
99.9
percent
on
ships.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
--
grier
--
you
haven't
mentioned
that
--
grier
in
norris
v.
city
of
boston,
where
he
says
the
tonnage
--
you
know
what
he
says;
it's
on
the
front
page
of
their
brief.
all
right.
that
seemed
to
me
to
say,
don't
interpret
the
tonnage
clause
to
apply
to
tonnage.
interpret
it
as
the
same
thing
as
if
it's
mass,
it's
mariners,
power
of
the
steam
engine,
number
of
passengers,
the
master
or
owner
of
the
vessel
--
all
those
fall
within
the
tonnage
clause.
that's
what
the
paragraph
seems
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
case
is
called
polar
tankers
versus
city
of
valdez,
alaska,
and
that
city
enacted
an
ordinance
that
imposed
the
personal
property
tax
on
the
value
of
large
ships
that
go
back
and
forth
to
the
city.
polar
tankers
owns
tanks
--
oh
that's
logical,
it
owns
tankers
that
transport
crude
oil
from
the
alaska
pipeline
terminus
that
ends
at
valdez
to
refineries
in
other
states.
polar
filed
this
lawsuit
in
the
state
court
and
it
said
that
what
that
tax
is
doing
is
it's
imposing
a
fee
on
our
ships
for
the
privilege
of
entering
the
port.
and
for
that
reason,
it
violates,
say,
clause
of
the
constitution
that
not
too
many
people
had
heard
of
which
is
article
i,
section
10,
clause
3,
which
forbids
a
state
without
the
consent
of
congress
to
lay
any
duty
of
tonnage.
we
agree
with
polar
tankers.
it
does
violate
this
tax.
it
does
violate
the
tonnage
clause.
over
the
course
of
many
years,
the
court
has
consistently
interpreted
the
language
i
just
read
to
you
in
light
of
its
basic
purpose
and
that
is
it
seeks
to
limit
the
coastal
state's
ability
to
obtain
tax
advantages
based
on
their
favorable
geographic
position.
say
by
charging
a
very
high
landing
fee
to
ships
and
it
seeks
to
prevent
states
from
indirectly
imposing
otherwise
forbidden
taxes
on
imports
and
exports
say
by
taxing
the
ship
and
not
taxing
the
cargo.
so
interpreting
the
clause
in
light
of
this
purpose,
this
court,
many
years
ago,
unanimously
concluded
â€œa
prohibition
against
tonnage
duties
has
been
deemed
to
embrace
all
taxes
and
duties
regardless
of
their
name
or
form
and
even
though
not
measured
by
the
tonnage
of
the
vessel
which
operate
to
impose
a
charge
for
the
privilege
of
entering
trading
in
or
lying
in
a
port.
in
our
view,
the
tax
challenge
here
is
a
charge
for
the
privilege
of
entering,
trading
in
or
lying
in
a
port.
the
tax
applies
exclusively
or
almost
exclusively
to
oil
tankers.
and
oil
tankers
can
be
subject
to
the
tax
just
based
on
coming
once
into
the
port.
and
the
tax
on
the
value
of
such
vessels
is
closely
correlated
with
its
cargo
capacity
because
the
imposition
of
the
tax
depends
on
a
fact
that
related
the
tonnage
and
the
tonnage
based
tax
is
not
for
services
provided
to
the
vessel.
it's
unconstitutional.
now,
the
city
defends
its
tax
in
a
part
of
the
opinion
that
only
has
four
votes
on
it
and
we
talked
about
that.
it
appoints
to
language
from
earlier
decisions
that
says
taxes
levied
upon
ships,
as
property,
based
on
the
valuation
of
the
same
as
property
are
not
within
the
tonnage
clause
prohibition,
but
--
and
they
say
that's
what
we
have.
this
court
later
made
clear
that
this
exception
comes
into
play
only
where
their
taxes
property
in
the
same
manner
as
other
personal
property
in
the
state.
and
we
think
that
means,
in
order
to
fund
services
by
taxing
ships,
the
ship
must
also
impose
similar
taxes
upon
other
businesses
likely
with
the
connection
to
the
state,
which
will
be
a
kind
of
check
on
a
tax
that
say
it's
designed
to
soak
the
ship.
here
we
can
find
few
perhaps
no
other
businesses
on
which
the
city
imposes
this
tax.
the
state
does
impose
a
somewhat
similar
tax
on
other
oil-related
businesses,
but
in
the
opinion,
we
explained
why
that
fact
doesn't
really
matter
and
doesn't
save
the
tax.
it's
really
basically
because
it
doesn't
stop
the
state
by
putting
it
more
colorfully
than
the
opinion
from
soaking
the
ship.
for
these
reasons
and
those
set
forth
more
fully
in
our
opinion,
we
hold
that
tonnage
clause
applies,
the
tax
is
invalid,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
alaska
supreme
court
to
the
contrary.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
that's
the
first
case
and
you
now
know
more
about
the
tonnage
clause
than
many.
