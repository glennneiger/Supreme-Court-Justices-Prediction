chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
08-310,
polar
tankers
v.
city
of
valdez.
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
does
that
--
why
does
that
matter?
i
mean,
do
you
--
do
you
concede
that
if
this
tax
were
in
some
sense
nondiscriminatory,
you
would
lose?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
are
we
having
all
this
talk
about
--
in
other
words,
you
think
if
there
was
a
tonnage
tax
applicable
to
everything
--
you
know,
your
pickup
truck
holds
two
tons;
it
has
got
to
pay
a
certain
amount
or
whatever.
then
do
you
lose
or
win?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
you're--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
i
think
you're
giving
up
an
awful
lot.
i
mean,
what
if
the
framers
--
couldn't
they
be
have
been
more
concerned
about
making
sure
that
there
is
a
free
flow
of
commerce,
that
ships
go,
and
the
fact
that
everything
is
taxed
would
be
less
of
a
concern
to
them?
but
you're
--
you're
willing
to
say
that
if
it's
nondiscriminatory,
even
if
you
would
call
it
a
"tonnage
tax",
you
lose?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
don't
--
you
don't
suggest
that
it
matters,
right?
you
--
you
have
talked
to
some
extent
in
the
briefs
about
the
bad
--
evil
motive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
are
not
going
to
suggest
that
the
same
tax
could
be
valid
or
invalid
depending
on
why
it
was
enacted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
was
going
to
say,
even
if
it's
a
flat
fee?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
every
vessel
has
to
pay,
you
know,
$1,000.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
just
on
a
--
maybe
this
doesn't
matter.
i
have
seen
the
capacity
of
cargo
planes
described
in
terms
of
tonnage.
does
this
clause
apply
to
those?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
--
we
have
an
evolving
constitution,
after
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then,
do
you
know
--
it's
not
an
entirely
frivolous
point.
i
mean,
do
you
know
if
states,
localities
where
airports
are
located
charge
things
that
might
be
viewed
as
tonnage
clauses
on
airplanes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
you
--
if
you
are
right
that
any
type
of
ad
valorem
tax
is
okay,
well,
then
why
in
the
world
would
the
framers
have
adopted
a
--
a
prohibition
on
a
tonnage
tax,
if
you
could
just
say
it's
a
tax
on
value,
which
is
going
to
have
the
same
impact
on
commerce?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
putting
aside
what
the
court
has
said,
i'm
looking
at
what
the
framers
have
said.
what
good
does
a
tonnage
tax
prohibition
do--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
you
are
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rothfeld,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
--
where
does
the
money
go?
if
the
city
of
valdez
collects
it,
where
does
it
go?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
i
think
we
ought
to
regard
it
as
a
city
tax,
not
a
state
tax.
they
collect
it;
they
keep
it.
that
sounds
like
a
city
tax.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
the
state
can
regulate
what
cities
and
municipalities
and
counties
can
do
throughout
the
state.
that
doesn't
make
everything
those
cities
and
counties
do
the
actions
of
the
state.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
--
under
your
view,
how
is
a
city
supposed
to
impose
a
property
tax
on
a
vessel?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
you
think
we
should
resolve
the
tax
by
seeing
how
generally
applicable
property
taxes
are
in
valdez?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
your
--
your
brother
suggests
that
other
items
of
property
are
taxed
under
other
provisions
of
the
tax
ordinance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
today
in
two
cases.
