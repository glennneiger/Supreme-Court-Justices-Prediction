mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
wheeling
case,
this
court
said
it
is
too
well
settled
to
question
that
taxes
upon
vessels
based
upon
their
value
as
property
do
not
violate
the
tonnage
clause.
in
fact,
no
ad
valorem
property
tax
has
ever
been
held
to
violate
the
tonnage
clause.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
justice
kennedy,
precisely
in
the
same
manner
as
other
ad
valorem
property
taxes.
now
let
me
answer
the
question
that
both
you
and
justice
breyer
particularly
addressed,
which
was
the
oil
and
--
and
gas
tax
imposed
with
respect
to
much
of
the
property
in
valdez.
valdez
taxes
homes,
it
taxes
oil
and
gas
property,
it
taxes
barges,
it
taxes
cruises,
it
taxes
all
sorts
of
things
just
like
every
other
jurisdiction
does.
the
oil
and
gas
tax
that
you
ask
about,
justice
kennedy,
and
you
did,
too,
justice
breyer,
is
imposed
--
and
there's
no
need
to
remand
back
this
case
to
address
this.
it's
in
section
43.56
of
the
alaska
code.
the
state
of
alaska
imposes
an
oil
and
gas
tax
on
property
used
in
the
oil
and
gas
extraction,
transportation,
et
cetera,
business,
but
it
also
authorizes
a
city
under
section
43.56
and
29.45
--
the
city
of
valdez
may
impose
that
tax
as
well.
it's
two
mills,
it's
just
like
every
other
tax
that's
imposed
in
valdez.
these
are
taxes
imposed
on
the
same
basis.
if
the
city
imposes
the
tax,
which
the
city
of
valdez
does,
then
the
tax
by
the
state
--
that
tax
paid
to
valdez
is
a
direct
credit,
dollar-for-dollar
credit,
for
the
tax
that
would
otherwise
have
to
go
to
the
state.
so,
in
the
first
place,
i
think
would
it
make
no
difference
as
suggested
by
your
question,
justice
breyer,
whether
it
was
the
state
or
the
city
that
imposed
the
tax.
the
constitutional
provision
refers
to
states.
states
divide
up
their
taxing
authorities
in
various
different
ways.
the
fact
is
that
the
state
of
alaska
through
the
city
of
valdez
imposes
a
tax
on
lots
of
different
things.
this
oil
and
gas
tax
that
we
are
talking
about
consists
of
60
to
70
percent
of
the
revenue
base
of
taxation
for
the
city
of
valdez.
the
--
the
ship
tax,
the
tax
on
the
--
that
actually
applies
to
vessels
which
include
the
tankers,
include
barges,
include
a
cruise
ship,
includes
just
alaska
ships
and
--
and
ships--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
fishing--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--they
don't
have
to
pay
this
tax,
justice
scalia,
but
they
pay
other
taxes.
there's
tax
on
--
on
the
weight
of
fish,
and
there's
tax
on
the
value
of
fish,
and
there's
tax
--
there's
--
fees.
they
use
a
different
dock,
and
they
pay
taxes
there,
too.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
well,
that
is
not
correct,
if
i
understood
your
--
your
statement
correctly.
this
oil
and
gas
property,
cranes,
heavy
equipment,
fire
engines,
motor
vehicles,
everything
else,
including
the
people's
homes
in
valdez
get
taxed.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
now,
that's
with
respect
to
mobile
homes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
they
are
taxed
as
real
property
when
they
are
affixed
in
that
way.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
tax
--
cities
may
impose
taxes
as
real
property
or
--
or
personal
property,
justice
scalia.
some
states
will
tax
mobile
homes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
justice
kennedy.
i
have
--
i've
given
you--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
--
there
are
various
taxes
imposed
by
valdez
on
personal
property
and
real
property.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
your
statement
is
correct
only
with
respect
to
the
ordinance
that
--
that
eliminated
the
exception.
these
--
these
big
ships
that
impose
enormous
burdens
on
the
municipality
--
you
can
only
imagine
what
300-400--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
i
know.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
know.
but
these
ships
were
exempt
from
taxation
in
valdez
until
the
year
1999
when
that
ordinance
that
you
are
referring
to,
justice
kennedy,
was
adopted.
it
eliminated--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--except
--
except,
under
the
--
to
the
extent
that
personal
property
was
covered
by
the
oil
and
gas
tax,
the
provisions
that
i
have
referred
to
--
valdez
had
been
imposing
that
tax--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
the
wheeling
case
is
correct
and
the
other
cases
that
have
repeatedly
said
this,
there
is
no
constitutional
impediment
for
a
city
or
a
state
to
impose
a
property
tax
on
property
being
used
in--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
--
well,
i
--
i
think
what
my
point
here
with
respect
to
this,
justice
ginsburg,
is
i
don't
know
the
answer
specifically
to
that
question,
but
we
are
looking
at
what
the
bundle
of
taxes
that
a
community
or
a
state
imposes
on
property
used
that
imposes
a
burden
on
the
community.
property
is
taxed
for
the
purpose
so
that
the
property
owner
will
bear
the
burden
of
the
governmental
services
that
a
city
has
to
impose.
it
--
there's
no
constitutional
provision
that
i
am
aware
of
that
says
that
you
have
to
have
it
all
in
one
statute,
collected
--
and
there
is
no
discrimination--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
disagree
in
part
with
what
you
said,
with
respect,
justice
scalia;
these
vessels
pay
11
percent
of
the
revenue
base
for
the
city;
11
percent.
this
is
a
city
of
4,500
people.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
this
is
the
amount
of
tax
collected
by
the
city
of
valdez
with
respect
to
ad
valorem
taxes
in
the
city,
including
ships,
mobile
homes,
cranes,
barges,
appliances,
real
property,
and
so
forth.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
pardon
me.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
am
--
i
am
saying
to
you
that
the
state
imposes
a
tax
but
the
state
specifically
allows
valdez
to
impose
that
very
tax.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
valdez
imposes
that
tax
as
a
part
of
its
total
taxation
package.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
answer
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
answer
is
section
43.56
that
allowed
--
the
state
statute
may
impose
that
tax
you
just
described.
and
it
--
and
section
29.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
it
does
impose
it,
and
then,
justice
breyer--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--section
29.45.080
says
--
i
am
going
to
read
it
exactly;
this
seems
to
be
an
important
point.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
it
ought
to
make
any
difference
from
the
tonnage
clause
standpoint
whether
it's
a
tax
imposed
by
the
state
or
a
subdivision
of
the
state,
but
this
provision
specifically
says
a
municipality
may
levy
and
collect
taxes
on
taxable
property,
taxable
under
as
43.
that's
the
one.
the
state
does
impose
this
tax,
but
it
also
allows
the
city
to
impose
it.
this
city
does
impose
it.
and
when
it
is
paid,
that
is
a
credit
against
what
might
otherwise
be
owed
to
the
state.
so
the
city
does
impose
that
tax,
it
does
collect
that
tax,
and
that
tax
is
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--a
municipality
may
levy
and
collect
taxes
on
property
under
this
section.
the
city
levies
and
collects
those
taxes.
now--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
state
also
imposes
the
liability.
any
individual
community
in
alaska
may
impose
that
tax
itself.
if
it
does
--
valdez
does
--
then
you
don't
have
to
pay
it
to
the
state;
you
pay
it
to
the
city.
so
it's
a
city
tax.
now--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
taxpayer,
once
he
pays
$10
to
the
city
under
this
tax,
doesn't
have
to
pay
$10
to
the
state
under
this
tax
because
he
gets
a
credit
for--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
it
is
the
taxpayer
that
gets
the
credit.
the
city
levies
the
tax.
the
city
collects
the
tax.
and
then
the
taxpayer
doesn't
have
to
pay
the
state.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
justice
breyer.
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what?
pardon?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
those
are
money
paid
to
the
city.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
now,
it
shouldn't
matter.
the
tonnage
clause
prohibits
states
from
imposing
a
tonnage
tax.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
it
would
not
be.
in
the
first
place--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
would
not
be
--
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional,
justice
stevens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
think
it
is
relevant.
the
--
the
nondiscrimination
issue
has
been
introduced
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
it
is
not
in
the
tonnage
clause.
it
is
not
in
any
of
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
having
to
do
with
the
tonnage
clause,
having
to
do
with
wharfage
fees,
pilotage
fees,
other
things
having
to
do
with
commercial
activity
in
a--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i'm
saying
that
it
would
not
make
any
difference
if
this
was
the
only
tax
that
the
city
imposed
unless
it
was
a
tonnage
tax,
and
the
tonnage
tax
--
this
court
has
repeatedly--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
the
ships
do
not
pay
more.
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
if
--
if
the
city
decided
to
impose
a
different
rate
of
tax
on
motor
vehicles
than
it
did
on
homes
or
--
or
vessels,
as
long
as
it
was
an
ad
valorem
property
tax,
and
this
one
is.
the
vessels
are
not
based
--
the
tax
is
assessed
every
year
on
the
replacement
value
of
the
vessels.
a
big
ship
that
is
worth
less
money
because
it
would
cost
less
to
replace
it,
because
it
doesn't
have
a
double
hull
or
a
double
bottom,
will
be
taxed
--
it
will
be
taxed
greater
in
proportion
to
its
value.
the
value
imposed
is
assessed
every
year.
there's
no
challenge
here
--
it's
very
important
to
understand
that
there
is
no
challenge
by
the
petitioners
with
respect
to
the
valuations
placed
on
these
ships.
there's
no
contention
that
the
value
placed
upon
these
ships
by
this
ad
valorem
property
tax
is
based
upon
cubic
capacity.
they
have--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
do
contest
that,
justice
ginsburg.
the
only
citation
for
that
is
justice
miller.
justice
miller
is
cited
for
that
in
a
lecture
that
he
gave
after
he
left
the
court.
he
was
on
the
court
from
1862
to
1890.
he
joined
the
court
in
the
--
in
the
inman
case,
the
wheeling
case,
the
parkersburg
case,
and
here's
the
quote
from
the
inman
--
from
the
clyde
mallory
case
in
1935,
which
is
quoting
the
inman
case
from
during
that
period
of
time.
"at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted,
"tonnage"
was
a
well-understood
commercial
term
signifying
the
internal
capacity
of
the
vessel.
"
this
court
has
said
that
over
and
over
again.
in
the
wheeling
case,
when
it
said--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
is
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
is
not
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
it's
--
and
it's
not
correct
in
this
case.
experts
put
an
assessment
on
these
ships
based
upon
their
replacement
value.
it
may
have
--
one
factor
may
be
how
--
how
the
ship
is
constructed,
whether
it
has
a
double
hull.
these
have
to
be
jones
act-compliant
ships.
the
newer
ones
are
more
valuable.
if
they
move
faster,
they're
more
valuable.
if
they're
more
efficient,
they
have
more
value.
one
of
these
ships
in
this
case
is
valued
10
times
more
as
--
higher
value
--
than
a
ship
that
carries
more
capacity
because
it's
newer.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
if
--
if
everything
else
was
equal,
the
bigger,
the
more
capacity,
the
more
valuable
the
vessel
might
be,
that's
true.
but
that
--
that
is
not
the
case.
different
ships
are
different
sizes.
they
are
made
out
of
different
materials.
they
have
different
structural
capabilities--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
is
what
this
court
has
said.
in
the
wheeling
case,
where
we
were
talking
about
steamships,
the
court
said
that
same
statement
that
you
just
made
about
an
ad
valorem
tax
property
tax
10
times.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
a
what?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
not
a
tonnage
tax.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
to
the
extent
that
the
tax
is
on
a
vessel
as
an
instrument
of
commercial
conveyance,
what
this
court
has
said--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
have--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--let's
start
with
--
with
the
basics.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
when
the
constitution
was
written,
the
constitution
did
not
intend
to
take
away
the
power
from
the
states
to
impose
taxes.
the
provision
on
the
import-export
prohibition
on
states
and
tonnage
clause
was
an
instrument
to
protect
commerce.
it
wasn't
an
instrument
to
reduce
the
power
of
states
to
impose
taxes.
the
baseline
is
states
have
the
power
to
impose
taxes
unless
there's
an
explicit
--
and
the
court
has
said
narrow
--
limitation
on
that
tax
power
in
the
constitution.
now,
what
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again,
justice
breyer
--
it
hasn't
had
a
chance
to
deal
with
portholes,
but
it
has
had
a
chance
to
deal
with
--
most
of
these
various
earlier
cases
in
the
--
in
the
1860s
and
'70s
had
to
do
with
tax
on
tonnage.
and
there
was
one
case
where
new
orleans
levied
a
tax
just
for
the
entry
and
departure
of
the
ship,
and
the
court
said,
well,
that's
--
that's
a
tax
on
the
ship
as
a
--
as
a
commercial
instrument
of
commerce,
and
that
would
be
covered
also.
but
nothing
else
has
been
covered.
and
the
court
has
gone
out
of
its
way
to
say
that
communities,
states,
are
entitled
to
tax
people
that
possess
property
within
their
jurisdiction
because
of--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--because
--
because,
if
you
are
taxing
--
i
think
that
the
court
had
reasons
for
the
conclusion
it
came
to.
what
i'm
saying
is
not
what
i've
invented;
it's
what
the
court
has
said
repeatedly,
that
because
property
may
be
taxed
as
property
because
the
users
and
owners
of
property
are
the
source
of
revenue
for
the
communities--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
does--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
--
if
it's
--
if
it's
a
state
using
a
tax
on
a
vessel
qua
vessel
as
an
--
as
an
instrument
to
limit
commerce,
that
is
something
that
the
framers
did
not
want
to
do.
they
--
they
prohibited
taxes--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
because
--
for--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
justice
scalia--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
the
framers
were
concerned
about
and
what
i
was
trying
to
say
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
is
that
there
was
a
limitation
on
the
states'
power
to
tax
imports
or
exports
because
of
the
fact
that
that
would
put
the
states
on
the
coast
at
an
advantage,
and
they
would
pass
those
burdens
on
to
the
inland
states.
the
tonnage
clause
was
put
there
as
a
specific
provision
to
implement
and
--
to
prevent
circumvention
of
the
export-import
prohibition.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
you
can--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
you
do,
it
would
be--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
then
might
--
that
might
be
a
due
process
clause
problem--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
it
wouldn't
be
a
tonnage
clause
problem.
i
would
submit,
justice
scalia,
you
would
be
very
upset
at
the
--
at
silicon
valley
because
the
--
the
property
tax
imposed
on
silicon
valley
gets
all
put
on
those
chips
that
we
used
in
all
of
these
computers,
and
everybody
else
in
the
country
is
using
those
computers,
so
the
property
that
is
taxed
in
that
community
is
the
property
that
creates
the
value
of
that
community.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
justice
scalia--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--you
would
--
you
would,
i
submit,
then,
say
that
vessels
are
exempt
from
property
tax.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it's
going
to
require
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
because
what
the
framers
talked
about
was
a
tonnage
clause,
and
they
were
talking
about--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
they
did
not
exempt--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
guess
i
have
to
resort
to
the
fact
that
every
time
this
court
has
considered
it,
or
at
least
in
almost
every
case,
the
court
has
gone
out
of
its
way
to
say:
they
were
not
intending
to
prohibit
states
from
taxing
the
value
of
property,
if
it's
an
ad
valorem
tax.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if
this
--
this
is
an
ad
valorem
tax,
it
has
various
different
statutes
and
ordinances
that
it
comes
from,
but
there's
ad
valorem
taxes
in
valdez
across
the
board
for
all
kinds
of
property.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
there's
--
no.
this
statute
is
--
every
other
statute
in
the
same
manner
imposes
taxes
on
property
based
upon
their
value.
this
was
a
separate
ordinance
that
decided
to
remove
an
exemption
that
had
existed
for
27
years--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
think
what
we
are
talking
about
is
whether
or
not
this
--
this
community
can
impose
a
tax
on
the
people
that
own
property
in
this
community.
there's
no
denial
that
there's
a
property
tax
situs
here.
the
average
length
of
the
time
in
port
of
these
ships
was
45
days.
the
entire
fleet
has
a
tax
situs
in
valdez.
so
this
property,
like
other
property
in
the
same
manner,
is
being
taxed
by
the
city
of
valdez.
the
wheeling
case
was
a
case
a
little
bit
like
this
in
the
sense
that
it
was
west
virginia
that
passed
a
statute
that
allowed
wheeling
to
impose
the
tax
on
steamships.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
only
thing
that
the
court
talked
about
because
it
was
--
like
this,
it
was
an
as-applied
case.
the
taxpayer
was
wanting
a
refund
from
the
taxes
and
the
taxpayer
owned
steamships
that
--
that
went
back
and
forth
from
wheeling.
and
the
court
talked
about
the
fact
that
this
wasn't
a
tonnage
clause;
this
was
a
state-authorized
municipal--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
what
--
what
the
thrust
of
the
overall
bulk
of
the
cases
including
the
language
by
this
court
repeatedly
is
that
property
taxation
based
upon
the
value
of
property,
not
imposing
a
value
--
not
imposing
a
tax
on
the
ship.
there
are
various
ways
i
suppose
one
could
say
that
every
time
a
ship
enters
a
harbor
without
developing
a
tax
situs
--
i
think
justice
alito's
question
focused
on
that
--
this
is
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--you
don't
get
charged
a
fee
for
entering
the
port.
or
one
of
those
cases
when
--
imposed
a
tax
because
--
it
called
it
a
wharfage
tax,
but
you
didn't
have
to
touch
the
wharf
in
order
to
pay
the
tax.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
--
i
think
you're
correct,
justice
stevens,
that
what
the
framers
were
concerned
about
was
a
substitute
for
an
export
or
import
tax
by
taxing
what
was
in
the
ship,
and
that
"tonnage"
referred
to
that,
but
it
wasn't
the
value
of
the
vessel
itself
because
the
court
--
the
framers
wouldn't
have
wanted
to
take
away
the
power
of
the
states
to
tax
commercial
activity
using
property
in
their
communities
in
the
same
manner
that
they
taxed
other
property.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
wharfage
tax--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
wharfage
tax
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
frequently.
the
only
reason
why
it
was
struck
down
in
that
case
is
that
you
didn't
have
to
put
into
a
wharf.
so
the
court
knew,
well,
it
wasn't
really
a
wharfage
tax,
but
if
it
was
really
a
wharfage
tax,
the
court
has
upheld
it.
