mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
valdez
vessel
tax
violates
the
constitution's
tonnage
clause
because
it
operates
as
a
charge
on
a
privilege
of
trading
in
port
valdez,
and
that
tax
is
apportioned
in
a
way
that
is
guaranteed
to
tax
extraterritorial
values
and
values
that
do
not
have
a
connection
to
the
city.
that
violates
the
due
process
and
commerce
clauses.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that
it
means
all
taxes
that
are
imposed
not
only
by
the
city
of
valdez,
but
they
are
including
taxes
imposed
by
the
state
of
alaska
that
are
collected
by
the
city
of
valdez.
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
our
position.
we
think
that's
absolutely
right.
i
think
it's
useful
to
focus
on
the
nature
of
this
tax.
it
is
a
tax
that
is
directed
exclusively
at
vessels
and
not
at
all
vessels.
it's
--
by
exempting
small
boats
and
all
boats
that
are
engaged
in
commercial
fishing
and
all
boats
that
dock
exclusively
at
city-owned
harbors.
this
was
a
tax,
a
property
--
it's
calls
a
property
tax,
but
it's
a
tax
that
falls
only
on
vessels
and
is
directed
at
those
vessels
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
--
i
think
not.
i
think
that
the
--
so
far
as
valdez
is
concerned,
the
vessels
we
are
talking
about
are
subject
simply
to
this
property
tax.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that
--
that
would
be
quite
a
different
situation
than
what
we
have
here.
here,
the
city--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
there
are
--
there's
a
huge
universe
of
personal
property
that
could
be
taxed
in
the
city
of
valdez.
valdez
has
the
authority
to
tax
all
of
this
property
except
for
a
discrete
category
of
oil
and
gas
property
that
is
subject
to
taxation
by
the
state.
so
valdez
can
tax
all
the
ordinary
kinds
of
personal
property
--
movable
property,
personalty
--
that
any
jurisdiction
can
tax.
they
can
tax
cars
and
trucks
and
moving
vans
and
refrigerators
and
jewelry.
of
all
those
innumerable
things
that
they
could
tax,
they
have
chosen
to
tax
a
single
item.
they
have
chosen
to
tax
vessels
and,
as
i
said,
not
all
vessels.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
but--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
state
of
alaska
treats
oil
and
gas
property
as--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--not
so,
your
honor,
because
state
of
alaska
takes
very
seriously
its
stewardship
of
oil
and
gas
property.
that
is
something
of
tremendous
fiscal
importance
to
the
state
of
alaska.
i
think
that
there
is
little
practical
risk
that
the
state
is
going
to
assign
the
right
to
tax
that
property.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
--
the
result
in
my
view
would
be
the
same,
but
that
would
be
a
different
and
more
difficult
case.
here,
focus
on
what
valdez
is
doing:
it
is
--
it
has
the
authority,
as
i
said,
to
tax
the
entire
universe
of
personalty
in
the
city
of
valdez.
it
has
chosen
to
tax
only
particular
types
of
vessels
that
are
used
in
the
export
of
oil.
imagine,
though--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--there
is
--
there
is
one
cruise
ship,
your
honor,
that
was
caught
up
in
the
net
in
the
first
year
the
tax
was
imposed.
otherwise,
the
tax
falls
exclusively
on
what
vessels
that
are
involved
in
the
export
of
oil
--
principally
tankers,
also
service
vessels.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--if
a
--
if
a
tonnage
tax
--
look
at
what
the
tonnage
tax
was
initially
designed
to
do.
the
framers
chose
the
term
18th
century,
tonnage
was
the
ordinary
way
of
valuing
the
value
of
a
ship
and
the
ordinary
way
of
imposing
tax
on
a
ship.
if
--
if
the
city
of
valdez
were
to
impose
a
property
tax
measured
by
tonnage
on
everything
--
on
vans
and
trucks
and
refrigerators
and
ships
--
that
would
be
a
difficult
case
for
us.
but,
obviously,
it
hasn't
done
that.
it
has
not
imposed
a
tonnage
tax
or
and
it
has
not
imposed
a
property
tax
on
any
other
type
of
property
except
particular
types
of
vessels.
i
think
you
apply
the
duck
test:
it
looks
like
a
duck--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
quacks
like
a
duck--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
--
i
was
using
--
in
response
to
the
previous
question,
imagining
that
they
were
imposing
a
property
tax
and
they
were
measuring
it
in
an
unusual
sort
of
way.
and
the
court
has
said
that
if
there's
a
generally
applicable
property
tax
which
happens
to
fall
on
vessels,
the
reality
of
that
tax
is
that
it
is
a
tax
on
property
and
not
a
tax
on
vessels.
but
here
we
have
quite
the
opposite.
here
we
have
a
tax
that
falls
only
on
vessels
as
cargo
vessels.
and
you're
quite
right:
the
framers
were
concerned
with
the
free
movement
of
commerce.
the
tonnage
clause
was
designed
to
close
the
loophole
that
was
thought
to
be
left
by
the
import-export
clause,
which
bars
the
taxation
of
imports
and
exports.
taxing
vessels
would
be
a
way
of
circumventing
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
would,
indeed,
because
the
city
in
its
code
creating
the
tax
preclusively
presumes
that
a
vessel
is
subject
to
the
tax
so
long
as
it
takes
on
cargo
worth
a
million
dollars
over
the
course
of
a
year.
oil
tankers--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
it
would
have
to
take
a
lot
less
than
half
a
tankful.
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--yes.
if
--
if
it
were
not
--
if
it
visited
the
port
of
valdez
once
and
took
on
less
than
a
million
dollars
and
never
came
back
to
the
port
of
valdez--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that
they
--
jurisdictions
impose
all
kinds
of
different
variations
of
tonnage
duties.
and
as
the
court--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
two
responses.
first,
i
think
it
is
not
the
case
that
under
the
old
tonnage
laws
necessarily
every
ship
was
subject
to
tax.
ships
could
be
subject
depending
upon
how
--
how
large
they
were,
and
some
ships
could
be
exempted.
so
i
think
it's
not
implicit
in
--
in
the
nature
of
a
tonnage
duty
that
it
applies
to
every
ship
that
--
that
enters
the
harbor,
but--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--one
would
have
to
look
at
the
practice
in
the
18th
and
19th
centuries.
and
some
of
the
court's
decisions--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
--
i
can't
point
you
to
any
authority
directly
addressing
that
point,
but
i
can
point
you
to
the
general
treatment
of
what
a
tonnage
duty
is.
i
mean,
it's
a
duty
which
is
imposed
on
vessels
on
the
basis
of
tonnage.
it
--
it
does
not
have
to
be
imposed
on
every
vessel
that
enters
the
harbor.
but
i
think
probably
the
more
important
response
to
your
question
is
the
reality
of
this
tax.
valdez
knew
what
it
was
doing.
it
wanted
to
target
--
it
was
commendably
candid
in
saying
what
it
was
doing.
it
wanted
to
target
the
vessels
that
were
engaged
in
the
transport
of
oil.
it
knows
how
big
oil
tankers
are.
it
knows
that
the
tankers
are
always
full.
when
they
come
in,
they
take
a
full
load
of
oil.
that's
--
that
is
the
whole
point
of--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
i
--
i
don't,
but
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--if
i
understand
the
example,
that
--
that
might
be
a
tonnage
tax,
depending
upon
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
if
--
if
it's
a
tax
on
oil
and
gas
property,
and
that
is
the
definition
of
the
tax
and
it
happens
to
fall
on
vessels
as
part
of
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--yes,
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
what's
--
what's
wrong
with
what's
going
on
here
and
--
and
i
think
this
is
in
answer
to
your
question
--
the
city
of
valdez
has
the
authority
to
tax
an
entire
--
as
i
said,
the
entire
universe
of
personalty.
and
--
and
as
--
as
you
described
it,
the
city
of
valdez
also
can
impose
a
tax,
although
it
doesn't
have
to,
on
--
on
vessels.
and
the
city
has
chosen
to
single
out
vessels
out
of
all
the
types
of
property
that
it
could
tax,
and
it
imposed
a
tax
on
them
called
a
property
tax.
the
reality
of
it
is
that
it's
a
tax
on
vessels.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
my
--
my
understanding
of
how
the
tax
system
works
is
that
this
--
this
is
a
state
level
tax.
alaska
determines
what
are
subject
to
tax,
determines
the
items
of
property
that
are
subject
to
tax.
it
determines
which
of
these
vessels
are
subject
to
--
to
the
alaska
tax.
it
then
allows
the
city
of
valdez
to
collect
the
tax
and
to
use
the
tax,
but
it
is
a
tax
imposed
by
law
by
the
state
of
alaska.
valdez
has
no
discretion
to
tax
things
that
are
not
oil
and
gas
property,
that
are
not
taxed
by
the
--
by
--
subject
to
the
tax
at
the
state
level
by
the
state.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no.
my
--
my
understanding
of
what
they
are
referring
to
is
that
this
includes
alaska-taxed
oil
and
gas
property,
including
the
alaska
oil
pipeline
and
the
oil
terminal
in
the
city
of
valdez,
which
are
enormously
valuable
pieces
of
property.
so
i
think
that
--
that
we
are
sort
of
talking
apples
and
oranges
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
it's
a
--
a
literal
duty
of
tonnage
on
the
cubic
capacity
of
the
ship,
it
--
it's
difficult
to
see
how
that
could
really
be
imposed
in
terms
on
every
other
item
of
property.
i
suppose
if
the
--
if
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
if
the
city
were
--
were
to
say
that
every
transportation
--
device
of
transportation
was
going
to
be
--
be
taxed
on
the
basis
of
its
cubic
capacity,
you
know,
vans
and
railroads--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that
would
be--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
we
focus
on
--
well,
no.
i
would
say
--
i
would
not
say
it's
necessarily
okay.
that
would
be
a
different
kind
of
situation
than
we
have
here.
here
we
have
the
purest
case
of
what's
--
of
--
of
a
tax
which
is
focused
exclusively
on
vessels.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
there
are
two--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
--
i
agree
entirely
with
that.
the
--
the
effect
of
this
tax
is
to
tax
essentially
the
charge
for
trading
in
the
port
of
valdez,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
framers--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
--
that
is
absolutely
right.
there
--
there--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--there
are
two
ways
that
valdez
could
go
about
taxing
these
vessels.
it
could
impose
a
user
fee,
and
the
court
has
recognized
in
its
tonnage
clause
decisions
that
even
a
--
a
tax
on
cubic
capacity,
a
tax
on
weight,
would
be
fine
if
that
is
a
user
fee
which
is
designed
to
provide
--
pay
for
services
that
are
provided
specifically
to
vessels
roughly
equivalent
to
the
value
of
the
services
provided.
so
that
is
one
way
valdez
could
do
it.
a
second
way
they
could
do
it
is
to
impose
a
nondiscriminatory
property
tax.
if
they
imposed
a
tax
on
the
citizenry
of
valdez
affecting
some
broad
array
of
personal
property,
that
would
impose
the
kind
of
political
constraints
that
would
discourage,
you
know,
abusive
export
of
the
city's
tax
burden,
which
is
just
what
the
framers--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
--
it
may
--
i
--
i
suppose
the
test
would
be
if
it's
predominantly
focused
on
vessels,
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
this
case
doesn't
provide
an
opportunity
to
--
to
explore
exactly
how
far
that
goes
because
this
is,
as
i
say,
the
purest
case
of
a
tax,
property
tax,
all
the
property
tax,
which
applies
only
to
vessels.
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
would
violate
the
tonnage
clause.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
--
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
that
however
ports,
states,
or
cities
go
about
trying
to
impose
a
tax
on
vessels
for
the
--
i'm
calling
it
the
privilege
of
trading
in
the
port,
as
distinct
from
the
user
fee
i
discussed
with
justice
ginsburg,
that
would
be
an
unconstitutional
tonnage
duty.
that's
what
the
court
has
said--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--according--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
court
has
so
held
on
several
occasions
that
a
flat
fee
violates
the
tonnage
clause.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
recipients
of
the
property
are
being
harmed.
valdez
is
taking
it
--
this
is
really--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--all
of
the
states
that
are
using
the
oil
shipped
through
valdez
are
paying
--
ultimately
paying
this
tax.
i
mean,
this
is
what
the
framers
were
concerned
about.
the
--
the
danger
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the
concern
that
the
framers
had
in
putting
the
tonnage
clause
in
the
constitution,
as
with
the
import-export
clause,
was
that
states
with
favorable
port
facilities
were
going
to
be
imposing
burdens
by
taking
advantage
of
their
favorable
geography
to
impose
burdens
that
are
going
to
be
felt
by
the
other
states.
that
is
exactly
what
valdez
has
done.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
--
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
--
that
is
precisely
right,
and
that's
just
what
the
framers
were
concerned
with,
with
the
tonnage
clause
in
the
constitution.
if
--
if
i
may,
i
will
move
to
the
apportionment
issue
in
the
case.
i
don't
want
--
i
don't
want
to
--
to
leave
behind
--
the
court
had
questioned
on
the
tonnage
clause.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
--
that
is
an
interesting
question.
it
--
it
was
written
to
apply
to
ships
simply
because
in
the
late
18th
century,
the
only
way
of
moving
substantial
amounts
of
cargo
was
by
--
was
by
vessel.
and
i
imagine
that
if
the
framers
had
in
mind
airplanes
and
railroads--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
will
leave
that
one
alone,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
don't
know
a
definitive
answer
to
that.
generally
speaking,
airplanes
and
other
types
of
property
are
--
are
subjected
to
property
taxes
on
the
value,
and
not
on
capacity.
although,
as
i
said,
the
framers
i
don't
think
cared
about
capacity
as
such.
they
just
cared
about
charges
that
were
being
imposed
upon
vessels
that
were
going
to
be
passed
through,
as
justice
scalia
said,
to
the
ultimate
purchasers
or
sellers
of
the
imports
and
exports
that
were
--
that
were
in
the
vessel.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
--
that's
right.
and
i
don't
--
i
hope
i
didn't--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
right.
and
as
for
the
chief
justice's
question,
application
to
moving
vans
or
cargo
planes,
the
court
did
not
consider
that
because
this
is
the
purest
case.
it
is
within
the
plain
terms
of
the
tonnage
clause,
the
historical
application
of
the
tonnage
clause.
it's
the
clear
intent
of
the
framers
in
writing
the
tonnage
clause.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
--
it
would,
although
it
might
be
possible
for
the
city
to
impose
some
type
of
user
fee
calibrated
in
that
direction.
the
court's
cases
refer
to
--
the
tonnage
principle
applies
to
the
number
of
passengers
that
the
ship
may
carry
or
the
number
of
crew
members
on
the
ship.
if
--
if
it's
not
a
proxy
for
particular
expenses
that
are
imposed
on
the
jurisdiction,
as
this
concededly
is
not,
that
was
not
what
the
--
valdez
intent
in
passing
this
tax,
then
it
would
be
problematic
under
the
tonnage
clause.
but
i
say
again
we
have
here
the
clearest,
easiest
case
under
the
tonnage
clause.
it's
a
--
it
is
a
tax
that
is
designed
exclusively
at
vessels
that
trade
in
the
harbor.
on
the
apportionment
question
--
and
i
don't
want
to
give
short
shrift
to
that,
because
the
valdez
tax
is
apportioned
in
a
way
that
is
guaranteed
to
impose
a
tax
on
values
that
are
not
present
in
the
jurisdiction
--
polar's
tankers
spend
only
a
small
part
of
the
year
in
valdez.
they
spend
the
rest
of
the
time
on
the
high
seas
or
in
other
ports
either
unloading
oil
or
in
dry
dock.
and,
therefore,
everybody
agrees
the
tax
has
to
be
apportioned.
the
ordinary
way
and
the
way
that
this
court
has
approved
the
apportionment
of
a
tax
on
physical
property
--
particular
physical
property
--
is
straightforward.
you
would
put
in
the
numerator
of
the
tax
the
number
of
days
with
the
number
of
miles
they
spent
in
or
number
of
miles
traveled
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction;
you
put
in
the
denominator
365,
the
total
number
of
miles
traveled
everywhere.
you
multiply
that
fraction
times
the
value
of
the
property.
and
so,
for
example,
if
i
had
a
transcontinental
passenger
train
moving
from
new
york
to
california
that
spends
20
percent
of
its
time
in
new
york,
new
york
could
tax
20
percent
of
the
value
of
the
train.
that
is
not
how
valdez
does
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
right.
but
the
--
the
valdez
theory
does
not
depend
upon
the
taxation,
the
taxability
of
a
ship
somewhere
else.
valdez
is
simply
saying
that
we
are
entitled
to
tax,
you
know,
not
on
the
basis
of
physical
presence
in
this
jurisdiction
at
all.
we
are
entitled
to
tax
on
some
concept
of
where
productive
commercial
activity
takes
place.
and
so
it
does
not
apportion
on
the
basis
of
amount
of
time
spent
in
the
jurisdiction
over
the
course
of
the
year,
which
is
--
which
is
the
approach
that
the
court
ordinarily
has
used.
the
valdez
approach
is
precisely
the
equivalent
of
new
york
saying,
in
my
transcontinental
train
example,
we
are
going
to
take
into
account
only
time
spent
in
new
york
and
los
angeles
loading
and
unloading
passengers,
and
we
are
going
to
discount
all
of
the
rest
of
the
year,
all
the
rest
of
the
time
that
the
train
has
spent
moving
the
passengers
from
place
to
place.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
this
court
has
held
in
the
central
railroad
case
that
the
taxing
authority
goes
to
the
domicile.
that
for
time--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
commercial
domicile
is
texas.
the
--
the
corporation
was
incorporated
in
delaware.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
these
ships
do
not
--
the
ships
berth
in
texas.
the
ships
do
not--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--if
i
may,
your
honor,
i'll
--
i'll
answer
that
question
and
sit
down
to
reserve
a
little
bit
of
time.
you
are
right
as
to
the
physical
location
of
the
ship,
but
the
--
the
jurisdiction,
the
authority
of
a
non-domicile
to
tax
has
always
been
constrained
by
--
under
the
due
process
clause
--
by
the
physical
location
of
the
property.
and
so,
the
fact
that
the
property
may
or
may
not
be
subject
to
tax
somewhere
else
does
not
give
valdez
additional
authority
to
tax
property
that's
not
present
there.
now,
the
court
has
said
that
the
domicile,
whether
or
not
the
property
is
present,
is
providing
benefits
to
the
owner
of
the
property,
and
it's
those
benefits
that
justify
the
imposition
of
the
tax
for
periods
when
it
is
not
in
any
tax
situs
subject
to
tax
by
anybody
else.
and
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
will
reserve.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
your
honor.
a
couple
of
quick
points.
first
on
this
confusing
question
of
what
the
state
of
alaska
does
in
the
nature
of
its
tax.
mr.
olson
began
by
--
by
saying
the
state
of
alaska
imposes
this
tax
through
the
city
of
valdez.
that
is
right.
it
is
a
tax
imposed
by
the
state
of
alaska
that
is
collected
by
the
city
of
valdez.
if
the
city
did
not
collect
the
tax,
it
would
go
directly
to
the
state
of
alaska.
it
is
an
alaska
tax.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
the
city
collects
it,
it
keeps
it,
but
it
has
been
authorized
to
do
that
by
the
state.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
but
it
--
it's
imposed
by
the
state.
the
state
decides
what
is
subject
to
tax.
it
identifies
the
property
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
--
that's
true,
but
this
particular
tax
is
a
tax
that
is
imposed
by
the
state
at
the
state
level.
it
--
it's
notable
that
valdez
has
never
before,
until
we
reached
this
court,
said
that
this
is
a
--
that
it
is
taxing
oil
and
gas
property.
the
property
is
subject
to
tax
by
the
state.
the
state
authorizes
valdez
to
collect
the
tax,
but
it
is
imposed
by
the
tax
--
the
city
--
the
state
determines
which
items
are
subject
to
tax.
so
this
is
out
of
valdez's
discretion.
valdez
chose
to
tax
only
particular
types
of
personal
property,
and
that
is
vessels.
second,
on
the
question
of
what
the
tonnage
clause
was
designed
to
do
and
--
and
the
wheeling
case,
wheeling
says
that
a
property
tax
is
okay
when
the
tax
is
imposed
on
vessels
the
same
as
other
property
owned
by
its
citizens.
that
is
not
what
is
going
on
here.
contemporaneous
understanding
of
the
rule
at
the
time
was
that
taxes
that
singled
out
vessels
were
unconstitutional.
we
cite
authority
for
this
proposition
in
our
reply
brief.
to
--
to
address
justice
ginsburg's
question
as
to
whether
there
were
other
taxes
like
this,
we
have
not
found
any
other
tax
anywhere
that
has
been
imposed
singling
out
vessels
as
--
for
--
for
property
taxation.
either
now
or
in
the
past,
we
have
not
found
any
case
addressing
that,
not
only
not
in
this
court,
but
in
any
other
court.
and
then
finally--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--my
--
my
understanding
is
that
real
estate
certainly
was
subject
to
tax
and
that
ports
would
have
the
authority
to
tax
other
types
of
property.
vessels
were
set
aside
as
a
particular
item
by
the
tonnage
clause.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
and
so
setting
aside
vessels
in
a
--
in
a
unique
category
when
other
things
could
be
taxed
would
have
been
problematic--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
--
it
should
impose
a
tax
by
imposing
a
tax
on
personal
property
generally.
and
if
it
does,
it
would
fall
on
vessels
as
items
of
personal
property.
it
--
it
is
significant
--
well,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
just
to
finish,
what
valdez
has
done
--
it
could
have
taxed
all
of
the
types
of
--
or
it
could
have
taxed
particular
types
of
it.
but
it
has
seized
on
only
one
particular
type
of
personal
property
to
be
subject
to
taxation.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
--
i
think
it's
an
easy
case
when,
as
in
this
situation,
there
is
only
one
item
of
property
that
is
taxed,
and
that's
a
vessel.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
again,
valdez
does
not.
the
state
does.
valdez
does
not.
and
so
i
think
that
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
to
go
beyond
and
decide
how
broadly
applicable
--
as
i
suggested
earlier,
our
test
would
be
predominantly
on
vessels
it
is
unconstitutional,
and
that
clearly
is
the
case
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
your
honor.
