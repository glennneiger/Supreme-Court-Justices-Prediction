mr.
rothfeld,
can
i
ask
you
a
question,
just
focusing
on
the
tonnage
clause,
not
the
elements
of
discrimination?
if
you
assume
that
the
tonnage
clause
was
designed
to
protect
new
jersey
from
being
exploited
by
new
york
and
perhaps
other
states
because
they
don't
have
their
own
ports,
why
does
that
rationale
have
any
application
to
this
case,
because
the
only
state
that
ships
oil
out
of
alaska
is
alaska?
so
there
is
no
other
state
like
new
jersey
who
could
be
harmed
by
the
tonnage
clause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
who
--
what
state
is
being
discriminated
against
in
the
scenario
we
have
before
us
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
saying
it's
an
unduly
onerous
burden
on
the
oil
companies
and
their
tankers,
and
they
only
ship
oil
out
of
alaska.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
exactly
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
you.
supposing
the
city
did
not
impose
any
taxes
on
anybody
except
the
people
who
pay
this
tax,
and
that's
all.
would
it
--
would
it
be
constitutional
or
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
but
then
why
is
the
--
what
other
people
pay
on
other
taxes
even
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
can
take
as
a
--
as
a
given,
for
the
purpose
of
analyzing
the
issue,
that
this
tax
is
either
the
only
tax
that's
relevant
to
our
analysis
or
that
it's
so
much
higher
than
all
the
other
taxes,
it
should
be
treated
as
the
functional
equivalent,
as
the
only
tax
we
have
to
look
at?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
suppose
you
could--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
i
don't
think
has
come
up,
but
i
just
wondered
if
anybody
has
argued
this?
the
duty
of
tonnage,
it
seems
to
me,
might
refer
to
the
cargo
rather
than
the
ship.
so
that
if
the
ship
made
10
voyages
it
might
have
10
times
the
tonnage
of
another
vessel
of
exactly
the
same
value.
has
anybody
argued
that
that's
what
the
tonnage
clause
refers
to?
