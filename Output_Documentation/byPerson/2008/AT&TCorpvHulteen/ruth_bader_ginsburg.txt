but
at
the
time
--
at
the
time
of
the
original
reduction
of
credits,
was
there
any
right
claimed
that
any
of
these
women
had?
i
mean,
nothing
had
happened
to
them
except
there
was
a
bookkeeping
entry.
they
wouldn't
be
hurt
until
they
sought
retirement
or
sought
some
other
benefit
that
increased
seniority
would
give
them.
but
could
they
have
come
into
court
just
from,
on
the
books
of
at&t,
they
were
docked
x
number
of
days?
nothing
has
happened
as
a
consequence
of
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
hadn't
been
applied
in
any
of
those
situations
yet.
at
--
at
the
--
at
the
point
when
the
person
returns
from
leave
and
is
docked
a
certain
number
of
days,
it
hasn't
been
applied
to
any
of
the
situations
you
mentioned.
i
grant
you
the
case
would
be
totally
ripe
if
there
was
a
better
job
to
bid
for,
if
there
was
an
early
retirement
opportunity.
but
here
there
was
nothing
--
nothing
to
be
done.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
you
have
to,
i
think,
recognize
that
there's
a
big
difference
between
evans,
who
was
told,
goodbye,
you
got
married,
you
have
to
resign
--
a
definite
act
that
had
immediate
consequences
--
and
this,
where
there
--
there
is
a
potential
for
future
consequences
but
no
immediate
consequence
of
the
kind
that
existed
in
your
model
case,
evans.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
when
gilbert
was
prevailing.
certainly,
we
would
not
regard
it
that
way
today.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
that
time,
even--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
more
so.
you
--
you've
said
several
times
that
it
was
perfectly
legal,
but
isn't
it
true
that
the
law
in
all
of
the
circuits
was
the
other
way,
and
it
wasn't
until
this
court
decided
the
gilbert
case
that
the
law
changed?
but
if
you
were
--
if
you
were
an
employer
and
you
were
advising
a
client
in,
say,
1975,
look
to
see
where
the
circuits
were,
the
circuits
said,
yes,
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
is
surely
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
it
wasn't
until
this
court
decided
first
the
aiello
case
and
then
gilbert
that
--
that
that
law
changed.
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
miss
blatt,
that
was
not
the
position
of
the
only
representative
of
the
united
states
in
the
ninth
circuit,
as
far
as
i
know,
the
eeoc,
the
brief
in
the
ninth
circuit.
we
don't
hear
from
the
eeoc
in
this
court,
but
i
think
it
was
not
just
that
brief
but
in
the
eeoc
manual,
they
are
taking
a
position
that
is
180
degrees
opposite
yours.
am
i
right
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
this
is
not
a
situation
like
evans,
somebody
who
was
out
of
the
workforce
for
4
years
and
then
is
going
to
come
back
and
bump
some
people
who
--
who
filled
in
while
she
was
not
working,
and
get
that
credit.
this
is
quite
different.
this
is
just
a
question
of
weeks.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
--
that
was
coming
back
to
work
and
having
all
of
your
seniority
stripped.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
russell,
what
do
you
say
to
mr.
phillips'
argument
that
you
brought
--
you
brought
essentially
this
case
way
back
when,
that
the
union
said
that
this
retirement
plan
is
in
violation
of
title
vii?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
--
are
you
making
a
claim
that
they
had
the
choice
or
that
the
claim
wasn't
ripe
until
they
felt
the
impacts
of
it?
