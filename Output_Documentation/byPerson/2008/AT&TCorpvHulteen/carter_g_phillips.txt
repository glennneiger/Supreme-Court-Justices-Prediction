mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
judge
wood
on
the
seventh
circuit
addressed
precisely
the
same
issue
that's
before
this
court,
i
think
she
correctly
observed
that
the
distinction
between
an
ongoing
violation
that
arises
with
each
new
use
of
a
seniority
system
and
the
present
effect
of
a
past
discrimination
is
a
distinction
that
is
subtle
at
best.
but
it
is
the
line
that
this
court
has
asked
the
lower
courts
to
draw,
and
i
think
the
majority
of
those
courts
have
actually
drawn
that
line
appropriately,
although
you
could
actually
probably
argue
that
it's
more
a
scatter
plot
than
it
is
a
line.
and
i
think
it's
a
scatter
plot
that
essentially
looks
to
three
primary
factors
in
evaluating
whether
or
not
this
is
a
case
that
is
more
like
evans
and
lorance
and
ledbetter,
or
a
case
that
is
more
like
bazemore.
and
those
three
factors
are
the
stale
nature
of
the
claims,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
seniority
at
stake,
and
whether
or
not
the
employees
have
fair
and
adequate
notice
at
the
time
of
the
action
of
the
employer.
let's
look
at
the
staleness
of
the
claim.
in
this
particular
case,
we
are
talking
about
maternity
leaves
that
were
taken
by
--
taken
by
the
respondents
between
1968
and
1976.
the
information
that's
available
to
at&t
today
is
simply
whether
or
not
these
particular
individuals
were
paid
for
periods
of
time.
there
is
nothing
more
than
that.
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
or
not
these
were
maternity
leaves
or
not
maternity
leaves,
whether
these
were
leaves
to
go
to
school,
leaves
to
take
care
of
--
of
parents,
or
leaves
for
any
other
particular
purpose.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
ginsburg,
they
not
only
could
have,
but
they
did.
if
you
look
at
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
--
and,
indeed,
respondents
in
this
case
did
--
in
the
communications
worker
case
out
of
the
eighth
circuit,
which
is
602
f.
2d
304,
they
specifically
alleged
that
one
of
the
bell
operating
companies,
one
of
the
subsidiaries,
had,
in
fact,
refused
to
grant
these
--
these
exact
service
credits,
sued
on
that
basis
pre
pda,
and
alleged
that
they
were
entitled
to
relief.
the
eighth
circuit
in
that
case
looked
at
this
court's
decision
in
gilbert
and
looked
at
this
court's
decision
in
satty,
and
said
specifically
this
case
is
more
like
gilbert
than
it's
like
satty,
but
never
remotely
questioned
that
that
was
an
actionable
claim
at
that
point
in
time.
and,
candidly,
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
that's
an
actionable
claim
because
there
--
there
is
very
little
that
is
quite
as
critical
in
this
process
--
in
the
employment
relationship
as
seniority.
and
--
and
we
are
not
talking
about
simply
benefits
seniority
here.
we
are
talking
about
competitive
seniority.
so
whether
you
have
a
--
a
better
claim
to
a
cushier
job
or
--
or
to
better
working
conditions,
all
of
those
are
determined
on
the
basis
of
--
of
seniority,
which
is
being
decided
on
an
individualized
basis.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
--
i
question
the
premise
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done.
i
think
the
average
person
told
that
they
have
less
seniority
today
than
they
had
yesterday,
and
if
they
were
told
that
on
the
basis
of
--
of
gender-based
discrimination
or
race-based
discrimination,
would
say:
i
am
entitled
to
go
to
court
today.
not
only
do
i
think
that
that's
the
way
most
people
would
react
to
it,
but
the
reality
is
if
you
look
at
the
way
the
litigation
arose
in
the
eighth
circuit
case
that
i
alluded
to
earlier,
these
very
--
the
same
union
here
made
exactly
that
claim
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
pda.
so
the
notion
that
the
employees,
one,
didn't
have
notice
--
they
clearly
did
have
notice
--
and,
two,
didn't
have
an
incentive
to
act,
they
clearly
did
have
an
incentive
to
act.
and
i
think
this
is
not
much
different
from
what
the
court
said
in
ricks,
which
is
that
obviously
you
have
more
of
an
incentive
when
you
feel
the
true
pain
of
a
--
of
a
discriminatory
act,
assuming
the
act
was
in
--
was,
in
fact,
discriminatory,
but
the
obligation
to
respond
more
--
to
respond
sooner
remains
on
the
plaintiff.
and,
again,
to
go
back
to
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
initially,
these
are
all
claims
that
arose
--
these
are
all
actions
taken
between
1968
and
1976.
and
one
of
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
mean,
justice
ginsburg,
there's
--
there's
no
question
that
the
impact
in
evans
is
--
is
stronger
than
the
impact
here.
i
will
readily
concede
that.
but
what
i
won't
concede
is
that
the
importance
of
seniority
is
so
far
down
the
pecking
order
or
so
de
minimis
in
its
impact
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
average
employee,
told
that
i'm
am
taking
away
your
seniority
on
the
basis
--
on
the
basis
of
your
race,
would
then
sit
back
and
say:
i'm
not
going
to
do
anything;
i'm
going
to
wait
until
the
impact
of
that
is
felt.
to
the
contrary,
you
would
expect,
given
the
--
the
centrality
of
seniority
as
a
term
of
employment,
that
any
employee
under
those
circumstances
would
respond,
you
know,
almost
immediately
under
those
circumstances.
the
--
the
second
factor
in
this
case
that,
it
seems
to
me,
this
court
has
relied
upon
significantly
in
the
prior
decisions
that
have
come
out
on
the
side
of
not
allowing
this
kind
of
litigation
to
go
forward
is
we
are
talking
about
a
seniority
system
here.
and
the
--
as
i
said
a
minute
ago,
it's
not
just
the
rights
of
the
individual
and
what
benefits
she
might
be
entitled
to.
the
seniority
system
obviously
affects
the
rights
of
all
members
of
the
--
of
the
seniority
plan
and
all
of
the
pension
plan
and
the
entire
system
that
the
seniority
operates
on.
and
so
there
are
third-party
interests
that
are
involved
here.
and,
again,
both
congress
and
this
court's
decisions
have
consistently
recognized
that
when
that
situation
arises,
the
resolution
of
the
question
ought
to
be
to
say,
no,
these
are
present
effects
of
past
discriminatory
acts;
we
should
be
loath
to
try
to
interfere
with
those
--
with
that
seniority
scheme
under
these
circumstances.
and
then
the
third
factor
that
it
seems
to
me
the
court
has
been
concerned
about
--
and
it's
one
we
have
been
discussing
--
which
is
the
--
the
--
you
know,
the
adequacy
of
the
notice,
where
the
employee
is
put
on
notice
at
the
time
that
actions
were
being
taken.
now,
we
can
quarrel
about
how
serious
the
--
the
actions
were,
how
detrimental
they
might
have
been.
but
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
question
that
the
--
that
the
injury
here
is
real
and
that
the
average
employee
being
told
that
you
are
being
deprived
of
seniority
on
--
on
a
race-based
or
sex-based
or
any
other
condition
that
is
protected
would
act
immediately.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
argument
that
the
--
that
the
respondents
offer
on
the
other
side
--
and
it's
almost
a
mantra-like
exposition
by
them
and
it
was
certainly
the
basis
for
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i
think
it's
where
the
mistake
arises
--
is
this
claim
that
this
is
--
is
a
facially
discriminatory
policy.
and
their
argument
is
if
it's
facially
discriminatory,
then
you
can
apply
it
now,
and
all
of
the
reasons
why
this
court
has
not
applied
these
--
these
kinds
of
claims
in
the
past
in
evans
and
lorance
and
ledbetter
is
--
is
--
are
off
the
hook
in
this
circumstance.
but
the
truth
is
this
is
not
a
facially
discriminatory
policy.
in
the
first
place,
this
exact
same
policy
was
looked
at
in
"sah-tee"
or
"sat-ee".
i
don't
know
exactly
how
to
pronounce
it.
and
the
court
said
these
kinds
of
arrangements
where
you
don't
give
service
credit
for
people
who
take
pregnancy
leave
is
not
facially
discriminatory.
so--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
regarded
as
facially
discriminatory
today.
i
think
it
would
be
regarded
as
illegal
today.
whether
it
would
be
facially
discriminatory
i
think
is
a
--
is
a
trickier
question,
because
again
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
the
other
side
relies
heavily
on
the
statement
in
lorance
about
facially
discriminatory
plans.
but
what
the
court
described
as
a
facially
discriminatory
plan
in
that
day
was
it
was
--
in
that
case,
was
a
situation
where
every
day
a
male
worker
is
credited
with
a
full
day
of
work
for
a
day's
--
a
day's
effort,
and
a
woman
is
credited
with
half
a
day's
work
for
a
day's
effort.
and
--
and
the
court
said,
quite
rightly,
that's
a
facially
discriminatory
plan.
well,
we
don't
have
anything
like
that
in
this
case.
this
plan
was
changed
in
the
wake
of
the
passage
of
the
pda
to
bring
it
completely
in
compliance.
so
the
plan,
as
it
operates
today,
is
--
is
not
only
not
facially
discriminatory;
it
is
in
no
way
discriminatory--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
breyer,
i
--
i
--
in
looking
at
this
case,
i
have
long
thought
of
it
as
kind
of
an
m.c.
escher
picture,
where
you
look
at
it
from
one
direction
and
it
looks
one
way,
and
then
you
turn
it
and
you
look
at
it
the
other
way,
and
it
looks
completely
different
to
you.
but
i
think
the
right
answer
to
--
to
your
analysis
is
that
the
way
to
look
at
bazemore
is
that
every
day
after
the
statute
was
enacted,
every
employee
who
showed
up
to
work
who
was
black
was
paid
less
than
every
employee
who
showed
up
to
work
who
was
white.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
as
the
court
said
in
bazemore,
unanimously
and
without
a
whole
lot
of
fanfare,
is
just
something
simply
illegal
under
title
vii
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
--
i
mean,
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
justice
souter,
is
that's
not
--
that's
certainly
not
an
implausible
way
of
trying
to
look
at
this
problem,
but
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
this
court
two
terms
ago
in
ledbetter,
and
i'll
quote
it
for
you:
"the
fact
that
pre-charging
period
discrimination
adversely
affects
the
calculation
of
a
neutral
factor
like
seniority.
"
--which
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here
--
"that
is
used
in
determining
future
pay.
"
--which
is
the
benefits
from
this
program
--
"does
not
mean
that
each
new
paycheck
constitutes
a
new
violation
and
restarts
the
eeoc
charging
period.
"
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
think
ledbetter
deals
with
bazemore
in
the
context
of
a
--
of
a
true
seniority
system
and
an
arrangement
in
which
what
you
are
looking
at
--
because
our
case
is
a
fortiori
from
--
from
evans
and
--
and
ledbetter
because,
remember,
we
are
talking
about
a
situation
where
what
we
did
at
the
time,
in
our
judgment,
was
perfectly
legal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
i
understand
that,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
then--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
mean,
i
understand
that,
justice
ginsburg,
and
obviously
we
don't
quarrel
with
that.
the
problem
obviously
is
the
court
did
decide
gilbert;
the
court
didn't
say
the
law
changed.
it
was
the
way
the
court
interpreted
the
statute
at
the
time,
and
under
the
interpretation
of
gilbert
and
satty,
what
we
did
was
perfectly
legal,
and
when
the
statute
changed,
what
we
did
was
to
bring
ourselves
into
assiduous
compliance
with
that
position,
justice
souter,
which
is
what
i
think
distinguishes--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
souter,
there's
no
question
that
you
can
read
bazemore
that
way.
i
just
think
that
the
way
this
court
has
read
bazemore
and
lorance
and
ledbetter
suggests
that,
in
the
context
of
the
case
we
have
here,
the
right
answer
is
this
is
more
like
present
effects
of
past
allegedly
discriminatory
acts
and,
therefore,
not
actionable
at
this
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
are
--
well,
both,
actually.
we
say
it's
not
--
we
say
it's
untimely,
but
we
also
say
that
if--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
exactly.
and
that
otherwise
it
would
have
to
be
retroactive
application
of
the
pda.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
just
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points:
justice
ginsburg,
you
asked
a
question
about
the
earlier
litigation,
and
let
me
just
quote
from
the
first
page
of
judge
bright's
opinion
where
it
says
the
appellants
in
the
class
action
allege
that
southwestern
bell
discriminates
against
women
by,
quote,
"refusing
to
extend
full
seniority
credit
to
female
employees
on
maternity
leave.
"
that
is
precisely
the
claim
that's
being
litigated
in
this
particular
case.
and
contrary
to
my
brother's
position
just
a
few
minutes
ago,
that
these
don't
have
any
impact
and
why
would
anybody
act
on
the
basis
of
them,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
lawsuit
belies
that
fact.
they
recognize
the
impact
on
seniority,
and
they
acted
immediately
as
a
consequence
of
that.
justice
souter,
i
do
agree
with
you.
i
think
the
reason
that
bazemore
is
not
the
--
i
wouldn't
say
"line"
--
more
the
point
of
authority
to
be
as
the
departure
in
this
particular
case
is
because
of
the
implications
for
the
seniority
system.
justice
kennedy,
the
problem
here
is
we
don't
know
exactly
what
the
impact's
going
to
be.
what
we
do
know
is
that
all
plans
are
funded
on
a
set
of
actuarial
assumptions,
and,
candidly,
if
they
say
we
were
overfunded
a
couple
months
ago,
given
to
what
has
happened
to
my
pension
plans
in
the
last
couple
of
months,
i
would
worry
a
little
bit
about
what
the
situation
is.
but
the
--
but
the
most
fundamental
point
is
you
don't
know.
and
in
that
context,
what
we
do
understand
is
that
congress
routinely
says
protect
the
seniority
systems,
protect
the
pension
plans.
you
know,
my
colleague
says,
well,
but
this
is
all
form
over
substance
because
what
if
they
come
back
at
the
end
and
decided
to
do
all
these
calculations?
that
fundamentally
misunderstands
the
nature
of
the
pension
process.
you
have
to
fund
these
in
advance.
you
make
actuarial
assumptions.
no
one
is
in
a
position
where
they're
going
to
allow
the
determination
of
seniority
to
be
made
at
the
tail
end
without
making
assumptions
about
what
they
are
going
to
be
like
going
in.
and,
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
is
the
answer
to
your
question
because
we
are
not
taking
this
complex
system
wholesale
and
just
dumping
it
post
pda.
what
we
did
is
we
retained
the
specific
rules
with
respect
to
the
accrual
and
the
seniority,
and
we
eliminated
the
underlying
distinctions
between
pregnancy
and
other
kinds
of
disabilities.
and
that's
how
we
apply
it,
and
that,
frankly,
is
fundamentally
different
from
bazemore
because
we
are
not
discriminating
every
day
in
a
way
that
harms
them.
we
made
a
seniority
decision,
like
a
pay
decision,
pre-act;
now
we
are
acting
--
it's
not
a
pay
decision
post-act.
and
it's
--
to
my
mind
in
that
sense
it
is
just
like
evans
and
that
line
of
cases.
finally,
you
asked
the
question,
justice
souter,
could
congress
have
done
--
have
done
exactly
what
the
respondents
ask?
and
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
congress
could
say
today
we're
not
going
to
allow
this.
it
would
upset
a
lot
of
pension
plans.
it
would
upset
a
lot
of
expectations.
congress
could
have
done
it.
congress
didn't
do
it,
or
at
least
if
it
were
going
to
upset
all
of
those
reliance
interests,
congress
would
have
done
so
in
language
that
was
much
more
explicit
than
what
it
has
done
in
the
pda
and
706(e)(
2).
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
i
urge
you
to
reverse
the
judgment
below.
