argument
next
in

07-543,

corporation
v.

mr.

chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
blatt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
you
--
do
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
stevens's
question
to
be
yes,
it
would
be
legal
to
adopt
this
seniority
policy
today?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand,
but
we're--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
even
adopting
the
policy
today
--
which
i
thought
was
justice
stevens's
question,
and
maybe
it's
not
--
that
would
be
acceptable?
in
other
words,
it's
not
simply
the
fact
that
this
--
the
leave
policy
--
the
seniority
policy
was
adopted
during
the
time
prior
to
gilbert?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
couldn't
adopt
the
leave
policy.
could
they
adopt
today
a
leave
--
a
seniority
policy
today
based
on
--
today,
based
on
the
pre-gilbert
situation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
russell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
--
could
i
pause?
i'd
just
trying
to
understand
your
earlier
answer.
it
just
took
me
a
little
while
before
you
got
off
on
the
other
point.
you're
saying
it
was
lawful
at
the
time
to
deliberately
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
--
gilbert
--
but
that
that
was
somehow
unlawful
if
in
fact
your
deliberate
discrimination
had
a
disparate
impact?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe
i'm
missing
it.
isn't
it
a
bit
unusual
to
say
it's
perfectly
all
right
to
discriminate
intentionally,
but
if
it
has
a
disparate
impact,
that's
not
all
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
every
disparate
impact
case.
in
a
disparate
impact
case,
it's
because
you
can't
show,
typically,
deliberate
discrimination,
so
you
look
at
what
the
impact
was.
but
i
guess
i've
never
heard
of
a
case
where
it's
okay
to
do
something
intentionally,
but
it's
illegal
--
to
discriminate
intentionally,
but
it's
illegal
if
that
has
a
disparate
impact.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
gilbert
said
it
wasn't
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex,
because
it
said
that
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
was
not
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex;
and
yet
you
are
saying
if
there
is
a
disparate
impact
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy,
then
it
is
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
your
--
is
there
any
other
--
can
you
cite
a
case
to
me
where
we
have
held
there
is
discriminatory
treatment,
but
that's
lawful,
but
the
discriminatory
impact
of
that
is
unlawful?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
russell.
mr.
phillips,
3
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
07-543,
at&t
corporation
versus
hulteen.
