justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
why
can't
you
make
exactly
the
same
kind
of
analysis
here?
people
here
are
not
showing
up
for
work.
they
are
staying
home
and
getting
retirement
benefits.
and
every
day
a
person
who
was
out
for
90
days
because
of
a
physical
illness
other
than
pregnancy
is
getting
a
retirement
benefit
with
an
extra
dollar.
and
everybody
who
was
out
--
who
was
out
for
90
days
for
maternity
is
only
getting
an
extra
33
cents.
and
--
and
why
isn't
the
payment
of
the
retirement
benefit
exactly
on
par
with
the
payment
of
the
salary
in
bazemore?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
--
do
you
see
ledbetter
in
effect
as
--
as
overruling
bazemore?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
--
and
at
the
time,
in
bazemore,
that
the
private
employers
discriminated
for
racial
purposes,
that
was
not
unconstitutional
or
illegal,
either.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
that
--
with
respect,
i
think
that
sort
of
begs
the
question
because
if
bazemore
is
the
right
template
for
analyzing
this
case,
then
you're
not
in
compliance
when
you
--
when
your
payment
of
the
pension
benefit
reflects
the
pregnancy
differential.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
--
would
you
--
excuse
me
--
would
you
agree
that
if
--
well,
let
me
be
less
rhetorical
about
it.
what
if
congress
passed
a
statute
providing
that,
starting
one
year
from
the
effective
date
of
the
statute,
no
pension
plan
will
differentiate
in
computing
pension
benefits
on
leaves
taken
between
--
as
between
leaves
taken
for
--
for
conventional
sickness
and
leaves
taken
for
pregnancy.
would
that
statute
be
unconstitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
to
make
it
retroactive.
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
--
your
argument
simply
is
a
--
a
purely
statutory
construction
argument:
that
isn't
what
congress
had
in
mind.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
congress
would
have
had
in
mind,
then
there
would
be
a
question
whether
congress
could
do
it,
and
you
agree
that
it
could.
so
the
question
is
simply:
did
it
or
didn't
it
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
--
do
you
think
ledbetter
modified
or
overruled
bazemore?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
does
it
upset--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
far
as
pension
benefits
are
concerned,
it
doesn't
upset
any
employee's
expectations.
the
ones
who
don't
have
a
pregnancy
background
are
going
to
get
the
same
pension
that
they
--
they
bargained
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that
--
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
an
issue
that
you
touched
on,
on
your
second
point.
i
don't
know
if
it
is
a
zero-sum
game.
and
if
--
if
i
were
faced
with
--
with
a
problem,
and
i
may
be,
in
which
i
really
have
two
choices
--
i've
got
two
analogies
in
our
cases,
i
can
take
either
one,
and
there
were
evidence
in
here
that
the
--
that
this
was
going
to
be
so
traumatic
to
the
pension
system
that
it
would
be
manifestly
unfair
and
perhaps
endanger
benefits
for
others
to
force
these
benefits
to
be
paid,
that
would
be
a
good
reason
to
go
one
way.
but
i
don't
think
we
have
that
in
the
case.
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
if
we
don't
have
it
in
the
case,
then
this
isn't
a
zero-sum
game.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
--
the
point
that
is
not
true
that
--
that
justice
stevens
is
bringing
out
is
that,
in
this
case,
you
had
a
plan
which
was
established
at
a
time
when
the
plan
was
--
was
lawful.
and,
in
effect,
you
are
saying
there
is
--
there
is
no
value
to
be
given
to
any
reliance
interest
on
the
part
of
the
company
that
established
the
plan
when
it
funded
according
--
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act,
when
--
when
it
--
it
calculated
it's
funding
on
the
basis
of
what
was,
in
fact,
lawful
conduct.
and
you
are
saying
that
is
irrelevant.
you
didn't
have
that
factor
in
bazemore.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
would
it
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
--
you're
not
asking
the
court
to
do
that,
are
you?
you
--
you're
saying,
look,
pay
--
pay
pension
benefits
to
these
people
exactly
as
they
would
have
been
calculated
if,
in
fact,
their
pregnancy
had
been
treated
as
whatever
the
regular
sick
leave
was,
so
that
they
would
get
full
credit
for
the
time
they
were
out.
you're
--
you're
not
asking
for
any
remedial
order
that
gives
them
anything
less
than
100
percent
of
what
they
want.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
--
how
do
we
--
you
think
that?
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
we
know
--
maybe
--
maybe
i
can
put
the
same
question
in
a
different
way.
let's
assume
--
and
this
isn't
a
bizarre
assumption
here
--
that
we've
got
two
lines
of
cases,
and
we
could
rely
on
either
of
those
lines
of
cases,
go
one
way
if
--
if
we
rely
on
line
a,
and
go
another
way
if
we
rely
on
line
b.
what
are
the
good
reasons,
apart
from
simply
statements
of
the
cases
themselves,
to
go
with
the
one
line
or
the
other
line?
one
reason
would
be
reliance
interests
in
setting
up
a
pension
plan
to
distinguish
this
from
bazemore.
how
are
we
in
a
position
to
make
that
judgment?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
at&t
provides
pensions
and
other
benefits
based
on
a
seniority
system.
the
system
relies
on
an
employee's
term
of
employment
which
is
understood
as
the
period
of
service
to
the
company
minus
uncredited
leave
time.
in
the
1960s
and
early
to
mid
1970s,
at&t
gave
full
service
credit
to
employees
on
disability
leave,
but
did
not
treat
pregnancy-related
absence
as
equivalent
to
disability.
women
including
noreen
hulteen
therefore
received
less
service
credit
for
pregnancy
leave
than
they
would
have
accrued
on
the
same
leave
for
disability.
at
that
time,
at&t's
differential
leave
policy
was
lawful.
this
court
in
the
case
of
general
electric
company
against
gilbert
concluded
that
a
disability
plan
excluding
disabilities
related
to
pregnancy
was
not
sex-based
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
title
vii.
in
1979,
in
response
to
gilbert,
congress
passed
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
or
pda
which
amended
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
defined
sex-based
discrimination
to
include
discrimination
because
of
or
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
in
light
of
the
change
in
the
law,
at&t
promptly
changed
its
policy
and
provided
service
credit
for
pregnancy
leave
on
the
same
basis
as
leave
taken
for
other
temporary
disabilities.
at&t
did
not
however,
make
any
retroactive
adjustments
to
the
service
credit
calculations
of
women
who
had
been
subject
to
the
pre-pda
policies.
hulteen
has
now
retired
and
if
her
total
term
of
employment
had
not
been
decreased
due
to
her
pre-pda
pregnancy
leave,
she
would
be
entitled
to
a
greater
pension
benefit.
she
sued
at&t
seeking
increased
benefits
alleging
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
and
pregnancy
in
violation
of
title
vii.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
found
such
a
violation
but
we
now
reverse.
section
703(h)
of
title
vii
expressly
protects
the
application
of
different
standards
of
compensation
under
the
terms
of
a
bona
fide
seniority
system.
in
other
words,
it
insulates
from
challenge
seniority
systems
producing
differences
that
are
not
the
result
of
an
intention
to
discriminate.
hulteen
argues
that
at&t's
differential
leave
policy
was
discriminatory
and
that
the
policy
infects
the
seniority
system
making
the
differences,
it
generates
the
different
pension
pay
outs,
open
the
challenge.
but
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
gilbert,
the
fact
that
the
--
and
the
fact
that
the
pda
is
not
retroactive,
at&t's
differential
leave
policy
cannot
be
considered
as
illegal
when
done
and
therefore,
cannot
be
termed
intentionally
discriminatory.
at&t's
seniority
system
is
therefore
a
bona
fide
system
under
section
703(h)
and
is
insulated
from
challenge.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer
joins.
