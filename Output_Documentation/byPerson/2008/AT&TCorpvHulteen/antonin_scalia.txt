justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
thought
the
question
was
whether
it
was
unlawful
at
the
time,
before
the
later
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
you
say
that,
even
though
discriminating
against
pregnancy
leave
was
itself
lawful,
a
retirement
plan
that
did
not
give
you
credit
for
the
time
of
that
pregnancy
leave
was
unlawful?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
gilbert
had
nothing
to
do
with
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
go
on,
finish.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
why
you
say
that
the
retirement
plan
is
facially
discriminatory
now.
you
contend
that
right
now
it's
facially
discriminatory.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
what
the
retirement
plan
says
is
that
there
is
deducted
from
your
seniority,
for
purposes
of
calculating
what
you
get
under
the
plan,
all
periods
in
which
you
--
you
were
lawfully
not
deemed
to
be
--
to
be
working
for
the
company.
now,
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
facially
discriminatory
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
didn't.
not
--
not
during
the
period
for
which
it
is
used
in
--
in
the
retirement
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
after
the
new
legislation
was
passed,
yes,
pregnancy
leave
counts
for
seniority.
but
--
but
during
the
period
before
that
occurred,
it
was
not
counted
towards
seniority,
and
it
--
and
it
was
lawfully
not
counted
towards
seniority.
so
what
you
have
is
a
retirement
plan
that
says
all
lawful
periods
of
work
--
all
periods
of
work
are
--
that
lawfully
must
be
credited
will
be
credited
to
the
--
to
the
employees.
i
don't
see
how
that
is
facially
discriminatory.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
--
is
there
a
difference
between
"facially
discriminatory"
and
"discriminatory
impact"?
i
mean
i
can
see
how
you
could
say
it
has
a
discriminatory
impact,
but
to
say
that
on
its
face,
when
all
it
says
is
that
you
are
credited
with
all
of
the
periods
in
which
you
were
lawfully
working
for
the
company
and
you
are
not
credited
for
periods
in
which
the
company
lawfully
deemed
you
not
to
be
working
for
the
company,
i
don't
see
how
that
is
facially
discriminatory
in
--
in
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
it
say
it
was
facially
discriminatory?
i'm
--
i'm
just
talking
about
your
--
your
assertion
that
it's
facially
discriminatory.
did
bazemore
more
say
it
was
facially
discriminatory?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
do
you
do
about
section
703(h)
of
title
vii,
which
--
which
we
have
held
says
that
--
that
makes
it
lawful
for
a
bona
fide
seniority
system
to
perpetuate
the
effects
of
pre-act
discrimination?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
hinges
--
that
hinges
on
your
"facially
discriminatory".
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
yes,
that's
--
that's
rather
implausible,
but
70(h)
covers
sex
discrimination
and
even
race
discrimination,
but
it
doesn't
cover
pregnancy
discrimination.
i
mean,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
need
pretty
clear
language
to
persuade
me
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
there
are
a
lot
more
suits
coming
behind
this
one--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
any
kind
of
discrimination
that
preceded
title
vii?
when
was
title
vii
enacted?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
may
be
still
some
of
those
people
around.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you're
scaring
me.
