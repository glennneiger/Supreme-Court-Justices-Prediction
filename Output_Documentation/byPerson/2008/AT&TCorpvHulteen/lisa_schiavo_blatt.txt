ms.
lisa

thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
impermissibly
imposes
retroactive
liability
on
petitioner,
and
respondents'
claims
are
in
any
event
time-barred.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
you
are
absolutely
correct.
and
ledbetter
--
this
court's
decision
in
ledbetter,
which
was
issued
after
both
the
compliance
manual
and
after
the
eeoc
filed
their
brief,
explained
that
the
eeoc
is
entitled
to
no
special
deference
on
the
interpretation
of
this
court's
cases.
and
the
eeoc's
interpretation
is
based
on
a
conclusion
whether
this
case
is
governed
by
evans
or
bazemore,
and
the
eeoc
hasn't
purported
to
even
discuss
the
retroactivity
--
or
the
retroactive
imposition
of
liability
because
the
pregnancy
leaves
in
this
case
were
taken
before
the
pda
and,
as
the
eeoc
acknowledged
in
that
compliance
manual,
that
denial
of
service
credit
at
the
time
was
lawful
under
this
court's
decision.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
unconstitutional?
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
think
--
i
mean,
the
way
i
understand
your
case
is
that
congress
can
speak
in
clear
language
to
impose
retroactive--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--retrospective
liability.
it's
just
there's
nothing
in
the
pda
that
indicates
that
retroactive
liability
was
imposed.
and--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right,
and
your
hypothetical
statute
would
seem
inconsistent
with--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
right,
and
i
think
the
--
the
seniority
system
provision,
703(h),
would
just
be
completely
counter
to
that
hypothetical
provision
because
congress
has
taken
special
care
to
make
sure
seniority
systems
can
continue
to
exist,
even
though
they
incorporate
pre-act
discrimination.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
with
respect
to
fringe
benefit
programs,
i
think
it
was
effective
on
the
date
it
passed.
and
there's
no
question
--
everyone
concedes
--
that
at&t
immediately
came
into
compliance
on
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
and
the
--
our
key
point
on
retroactivity
is
the
way
to
look
at
this
is
what
the
statute
prohibited
and
that
is
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
and
the
pregnancy
discrimination
occurred
in
this
case
based
on
the
discriminatory
leave
policies,
and
those
--
those
were
all
taken
in
the
'60s
and
'70s
before
the
pda
was
passed.
and
what
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
does
is
it
orders
petitioner
to
restore
service
credit
taken
for
the
pregnancy
leave
before
the
passage
of
the
--
of
the
pda.
and
i--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no.
it
just
put
it
in
context,
and
i
don't
think
that
bazemore
deals
with
the
retroactivity
point,
and
let
me
explain
why:
the
--
the
employer
in
bazemore
who
continued
to
pay
african
americans
less
than
whites
was
ordered
prospectively
to
start
paying
equal
wages
for
equal
work,
but
specifically
not
ordered
to
make
up
for
past
wage
differentials.
and
i
think
it's
for
three
reasons.
what
this
does
is
much
--
much
more
prejudicial
and
upsets
expectations
in
three
ways,
and
this
is
some
of
the
things
that
mr.
phillips
talked
about.
and
at
the
time
the
pregnancy
leaves
were
taken,
the
petitioner
was
entitled
and
probably
required
to
make
planning
and
funding
decisions
for
its
pension
liabilities.
second,
the
petitioner
should
not,
30
to
40
years
after
the
fact,
have
to
defend
claims
about
whether
these
women
were
disabled
and
actually
unable
to
work
due
to
pregnancy,
when
medical
records
and
personnel
records
are
probably
missing
and
memories
long
since
faded.
and,
third,
the
retroactive
scrambling
of
a
seniority
system
upsets
the
vested
rights
of
other
employees.
and
i
just
don't
think
you
have
any
of
that
in
bazemore.
the
employer
said--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--you
me
to
pay
out
money
prospectively.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
i
think
of
a
pension
plan
as
a
zero-sum
game.
there's
a
more
limited
amount.
but
more
specifically,
there--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
i--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
we
don't
know
what
we
have
in
the
case,
because
it
was
--
it
was
--
liability
was
imposed
on
summary
judgment.
the
class
allegations
are
15,000.
but
my
point
on
vested
seniority
rights
is
that
the
class
includes
current
employees.
the
respondent
porter
is
a
current
employee.
the
order
in
this
case
is
to
restore
seniority
credit,
i
assume
for
current
employees,
which
will
give
them
greater
seniority
rights
vis-a-vis
other
employees
who
have
planned
their
own
issues
about
job
bidding
and
retirement
and
seniority
based
on
30
to
40
years
of
expectations.
so
i--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no,
i
think
some
--
some
of
these
people
had
very
significant
disabilities,
over
6,
7
months.
but
in
terms
of
the
fairness
here,
i
mean,
the
--
the
female
flight
attendant
was
discharged
on
a
facially
discriminatory
policy
of
forcing
married
female
flight
attendants
to
resign.
here,
the
two
supreme
court
cases
have
said
that
the
decision
--
as
inexplicable
as
it
was,
the
decision
not
to
treat
pregnancy
as
a
disability
was
not
on
its
face
a
discriminatory
policy.
now,
the
pda
immediately
overruled
that,
but
applied
it
prospectively,
and
now
we
are
here
30
to
40
years
later
basically
litigating
the
complaint
that
was
brought
in
the
eighth
circuit
as
well
as
the
complaint
that
was
brought
in
the
second
circuit
by
the
respondent
here.
they
brought
this
case
twice
in
the
second
--
and
these
are
all
cited
on
the
petitioner's
brief
and
the
reply
brief
on
page
17.
in
the
second
circuit
case,
it
was
granted,
vacated,
and
remanded
in
light
of
gilbert.
and
then
in
the
eighth
circuit
case,
they
actually
lost
on
the
merits
under
satty.
now,
the
only
thing
that
has
changed
is
the
passage
of
30
years
and
the
pda,
which
doesn't
apply
retroactively.
so
i
just
think
that--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--let
me
be
very
clear
on
this.
the
seniority
system
in
this
case
is
facially
neutral;
it
just
accords
seniority
to
men
and
women
on
an
equal
basis
depending
on
whether
they
took
disability
leave
or
personal
leave.
the
leave
policy
that
forced
women
to
take
pregnancy
leave
as
personal
leave
would
be
illegal
if
it
were
adopted
today,
because
the
pda
says
you
can't
treat
--
women
affected
by
pregnancy
have
to
be
treated
for
the
same
purposes.
so
the
seniority
system
is
always
just
the
same.
it
says,
based
on
total
years
of
service,
you
get
pension
benefits,
men
and
women
the
same.
in
the
accrual
policy,
men
and
women
were
treated
identically.
just
like
in
evans,
men
and
women
were
denied
seniority
or
service
credit
if
they
were
terminated
for
--
for
charge,
and
there
was
a
separate
unlawful
policy
that
basically
defined
--
cause
--
excuse
me
--
if
you
were
terminated
for
cause
--
and
a
separate
policy
that
defined
"cause"
to
say,
well,
if
you
were
a
female
flight
attendant
and
you
married,
then
you
were
forced
to
resign.
so
obviously
that
policy
was
always
unlawful.
it
would
be
unlawful
today.
and
similarly,
if
at&t
hadn't
had
changed
its
leave
policy,
someone
could
sue
immediately.
i
mean,
these
women
--
the
immediate--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes
--
the
seniority
system
is
their
seniority
system,
and
it's
completely
neutral
and
completely
lawful.
at&t's
pre
pda
leave
policy.
that
if
you
were
a
woman
and
you
take
pregnancy--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
unlawful
today.
that
would
be
facial
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy,
and
it
would
be
unlawful.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
--
at&t
could
not
adopt
their
leave
policy
today,
and--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--oh.
then
i
think
you
would
have
a
--
well,
you
would
have
an
unlawful
policy
that
someone
could
sue
on
immediately,
and
it
would
be
facial
discrimination,
and
we
wouldn't
be
up
here
making
a
retroactivity
argument
because
no
court
would
be
ordering
them
to
undo
decisions
that
were
made
before
the
passage
of
the
act.
they
today
would
be
making
decisions
and
there
were
nothing
--
there
would
be
no
retroactive
imposition
of
liability.
thank
you.
