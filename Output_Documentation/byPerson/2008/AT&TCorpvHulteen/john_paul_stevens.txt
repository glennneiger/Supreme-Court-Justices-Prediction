justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
one
thing:
are
you
contending
that
the
plan
is
not
unlawful
or
that
the
claim
is
untimely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
the
time
it
was
adopted,
it
was
lawful.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
correctly
understand
that
--
that
you
would
agree
that
if
this
plan
were
adopted
today
it
would
be
unlawful,
but
because
it
was
--
that
at
the
time
it
was
adopted,
and
the
statute
uses
the
word
"adopted",
it
was
lawful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question?
if
there
is
a
facially
discriminatory
system,
are
you
saying
this
is
a
disparate
impact
case
or
a
disparate
treatment
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
did
the
--
when
did
the
intentional
discrimination
take
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
not
--
you
do
not
contend
that
the
plan
was
unlawful
at
the
time
it
was
adopted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
question:
at
the
time
the
plan
was
adopted,
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
was
not
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex,
according
to
the
majority
in
gilbert.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
i
happen
to
disagree
with.
so
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
seems
to
me
at
the
time
the
plan
was
adopted
it
was
a
lawful
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
the
statute
use
the
term
--
does
the
statute
use
the
term
"facially
discriminatory
system"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
also
clear
that
--
is
it
also
clear
that
a
statute
--
that
--
that
a
plan
that
does
not
intentionally
discriminate
may,
nevertheless,
discriminate
facially?
i
think
the
two
things--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
that
was
the
current
application
of
a
system
that
was
plainly
discriminatory,
intentionally
discriminatory.
lorance
was.
they
intentionally
discriminated
against
women.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
in
bazemore
each
paycheck
was
discriminatory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
reason
for
that
is
because
they
adopted
a
plan
a
long
time
ago
that
was
lawful.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
not
applying
a
plan
in
bazemore.
they're
paying
a
current
salary.
they're
paying
black
people
less
than
whites
just
because
they
are
black.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
they
were
still
paying
--
each
paycheck
was
a
discriminatory
paycheck.
it
didn't
depend
on
history;
whereas,
a
pension
plan
--
they
always
look
at
the
formation
of
the
plan.
at
least
under
subsection
(h),
i
think
you
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
what
i
disagree
with.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
look
at
the
present
in
bazemore,
you
find
they
are
getting
different
salaries
because
of
the
difference
in
--
one
is
of
one
race,
and
the
other
is
of
another
race.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
still
want
to
go
back
to
assure
that
i've
given
you
a
fair
opportunity
to
answer
this.
you
are
relying
on
nashville
v.
satty,
which
was
a
discriminatory
impact
case,
and
now
you
are
arguing
that
the
key
is
the
--
is
the
intent.
which
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
soon
as
you
get
back
to
the
intentional,
you
get
away
from
satty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
was
not
unlawful
at
the
time
it
was
done.
