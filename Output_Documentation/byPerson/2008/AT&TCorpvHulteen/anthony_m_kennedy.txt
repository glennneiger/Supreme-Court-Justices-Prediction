justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
this
statute
effective
180
days
after
its
--
after
signature?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
doesn't
the
risk
or
the
potential
of
a
fixed-fund
pension
plan
where
employees
who
are
not
parties
to
this
action
receive
less?
isn't
there
at
least
that
possibility?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
shouldn't
that
possibility
be
weighed
in
the
decision
of
this
court?
i
think
that's
the
line
of
questioning
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there's
no
realistic
possibility
that
some
pensions
are
based
on
a
fixed
fund
which
has
been
established
already?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
that
this
decision
you
want
us
to
write
applies
across
the
board
to
all
plaintiffs.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
when
you
say
there's
relatively
little
amounts
of
money,
can
you
tell
us
what
amount
--
what
the
maximum
amount
would
be
involved?
are
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--would
it
be
less
than
$100,000?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
--
for
the
whole
suit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
that
be
a
million
--
a
million
dollars?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
--
that's
a
small
amount
of
money,
a
million
--
millions
of
dollars?
