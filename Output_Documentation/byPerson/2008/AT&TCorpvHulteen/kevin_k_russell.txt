mr.
kevin
k.
russell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
distinction
between
evans
and
this
case
turns
on
the
difference
between
discrimination
outside
of
the
seniority
system
which
affects
an
employee's
ability
to
provide
service
to
the
employer,
and
discrimination
within
the
seniority
system
itself
that
gives
unequal
credit
for
equal
service.
congress
drew
that
line,
adopting
one
that
this
court
had
referred
to
in
lorance,
when
it
passed
section
706(e)
(
2)
of
title
vii,
which
provided
that
a
facially
discriminatory
seniority
system
can
be
challenged,
not
only
when--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--this
is
a
disparate
treatment
case.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
it
took
place
when
at&t
applied
an
accrual
rule
to
my
clients'
disability
leave,
and
said--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--we
think
that
it
was,
but
it
doesn't
matter.
ultimately
under
706(e)(
2),
what
matters
is
that
the
plan
discriminated
on
its
face.
and
the
insight
beyond
that
--
and
that
doesn't
turn
on
whether
it
is
unlawful
or
not.
a
plan
that
discriminates
against
short
people
discriminates
on
its
face,
intentionally
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
height
every
time
it's
applied;
and
when
it
does,
whether
it's
lawful
or
not,
is
applied
in
accordance
with
the
law
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
application.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
we
think
it
was
unlawful
for
two
reasons,
and
one
is
that
it
was
unlawful
under
satty.
now,
i
acknowledge--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--under
satty,
under
the
court's
decision
in
satty
that
said
discrimination
with
respect
to
seniority
had
an
unlawful
discriminatory
impact
on
the
basis
of
sex.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that
is
correct,
but
we
don't
think
that
there's
a
distinction
because
what
the
court
said
was
that
the
injury
is
cognizable
because
it
affects
employment
opportunities.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
yes,
and
we
think--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--no.
let
me
be
clear.
we
think
that
at
the
time
our
clients
took
their
leave,
it
was
unlawful
under
title
vii
and
under
satty
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
with
respect
to
seniority,
whether
it's
the
right
to
retain
accrued
seniority
or
the
right
to
accumulate
it
in
the
first
place.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
gilbert
said
that
it
wasn't
intentional
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
satty
said
it
had
an
unlawful
disparate
impact
on
the
basis
of
sex.
but
ultimately
none
of
this
matters,
because
under
section
706(e)(
2),
the
question
is
whether
the
system
as
a
whole,
which
includes
the
accruable,
discriminates
on
its
face,
whether
it's
intentionally
discriminatory;
and
the
insight
behind
that
rule
was,
as
i
said
before
with
the
example
of
a
height
discrimination,
a
rule
that
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
height
intentionally
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
height
every
time
it's
applied.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
had
a
disparate
impact
on
the
basis
of
sex,
yes.
that's
what
satty
held
--
that's
what
satty
held
clearly
with
respect
to
accrued
seniority.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
that's
every
disparate
impact
case.
it's
not
that
it's
all
right.
it's
just
that
it's
not--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--let
me
just
be
clear
about
the
terms.
gilbert
said
it
was
not
unlawful
intentional
sex
discrimination,
but
satty
said
that
it
constitutes
--
that
pregnancy
discrimination
with
respect
to
seniority
credits
constitutes
--
has
an
unlawful
disparate
impact
on
the
basis
of
sex.
in
that
sense--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--let
me
try
one
more
time.
and
maybe
--
it's
just
to
say
that
sometimes,
intentional
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
can
have
a
disparate
impact
on
the
basis
of
sex.
that's
what
satty
said
--
satty
said.
but--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
i
think
a
height
requirement
would
be
intentional
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
height
that
could
have
an
unlawful
disparate
impact
on
the
basis
of
sex.
i
think
it's
a
parallel
construction.
but,
ultimately,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
waste
too
much
time
on
this,
because
i
don't
think
it
matters
because
the
insight
behind
section
706(e)(
2)
is
that
every
act
that
implements
a
facially
discriminatory
system
constitutes
a
fresh
act
of
that
intentional
discrimination.
and
so
there's
no
question--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--no.
it
uses
the
term
"intentionally
discriminatory
system".
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
and
there's
no
dispute
that
a
facially
discriminatory
system
discriminates
intentionally.
and
so--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
again,
it's
--
it's
the
predicates
that
change.
it's
a
--
it
can
be
a
plan
that
doesn't
intentionally
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex
at
the
time,
in
the
past.
but
when
it
--
but
it's
clear
that
it
intentionally
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
and
so
then
the
question
--
so
then
under
706(e)(
2),
under
this
court's
insight
in
lorance,
the
current
application
of
that
system
constitutes
a
present
act--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--yes.
the
--
the
intent
behind
the
system
is
imbued
in
every
application
of
the
system.
so
a
system
that
is
intentionally
discriminatory
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
discriminates
intentionally
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
every
time
it's
applied.
and
the
question--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--and,
under
section
706(e)(
2),
the
question
is
simply
whether
that
discrimination
is
unlawful
at
the
time
of
application--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--yes,
it's--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
it's
--
the
system
is
facially
discriminatory
--
there
are
several
parts.
one
is:
what
set
of
rules
constitutes
a
relevant
seniority
system?
and
we
think
that
the
rule
that
says
pregnancy
leave
doesn't
get
full
credit
is
as
an
accrual
rule,
it's
part
of
the
seniority
system.
and
that
rule
discriminated
on
its
face
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
there's
no--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--it
facially
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
and
then
does
so
whether
the
pregnancy
discrimination
was
unlawful
at
the
time
or
not.
and
under
706(e)(
2),
that
--
that
facially
discriminatory
intent
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
is
carried
forward
today
in
every
application.
and
the
whole
point
of
the
rule
was
simply
to
say
that
we
don't
want
to
force
employees
to
have
to
run
into
court
every
time
there's
some
discrimination--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
that
scenario,
i
think,
is
indistinguishable
from
what
happened
in
bazemore.
recall,
in
bazemore,
that
the
basic
rule
is
you
get
paid
now
today
what
we
paid
you
before
title
vii,
plus
a
nondiscriminatory
raise.
and
this
court
said
that
that
is
simply
perpetuation
of
the
pre-act
intentional
race
discrimination,
which
wasn't
unlawful
at
the
time.
but
if
you
apply
that
system
today,
that
constitutes
a
present
act
of
racial
discrimination
subject
to
the
present
requirements
of
title
vii.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no,
bazemore
did
not
use
that
term.
but
this
court,
in
ledbetter,
assumed
that
the
rationale
of
bazemore
was
the
rationale
this
court
gave
in
lorance,
which
was
that
it
involved
a
--
intentionally
a
systematic
system
of
discrimination
that,
even
though
it
was
lawful
when
it
was
instituted
--
was
first
instituted,
its
carrying
over
into
the
present
era
subjects
it
to
the
requirements
of
title
vii
now.
and
i
don't
think
it's
--
it's
fairly
distinguishable
because
what
the
employer
in
bazemore
did
is
--
is
simply
what
at&t
has
done
here.
at
the
time
title
vii
took
effect,
the
employer
in
bazemore
stopped
giving
discriminatory
base
salaries
and
stopped
giving
discriminatory
pay
raises,
but
it
just
added
to
that
base
salary
in
a
nondiscriminatory
manner,
in
the
same
way
that
at&t
stopped
discriminating
in
the
amounts
that
it
added
to
accrued
seniority.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
it
was
discriminatory
in
the
sense
that
it
paid
unequal
wages
for
equal
work.
and
here
our
pension
checks
give
unequal
compensation
for
equal
amounts
of
service
to
the
company.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
the
same
thing
was
true
in
bazemore.
they
had
adopted--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--they
were
applying
a
pay
structure
that
was
adopted--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--the
paychecks
were
in
--
in
bazemore
were
intentionally
discriminatory
only
insofar
as
you
look
back
to
the
pre-title
vii--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--and
the
same
is
true
here.
our
clients
are
giving--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--it's
not
irrelevant.
it's
simply
something
that
this
court
has
traditionally
taken
into
account
at
the
remedial
stage.
the
court
has--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
the
--
in
florida
v.
long
--
there's
a
long
line
of
cases
where
this
court--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--we're
not
asking
for
that
because
we
don't
think
that
there
are
substantial
reliance
interests
that
are
--
with
respect
to
the
--
the
liquidity
of
the
--
the
pension
plan
that
are
affected
here.
my
point
is
simply
that--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
don't
think
you
are,
which
is
why
i
do
think
that
it's
perfectly
appropriate
for
this
court
to
do
what
it
did
in
cases
like
manhart,
which
is
to
say
there's
one
definition
of
vii,
and
it's
not
going
to
vary
depending
on
whether
we're
talking
about
the
pension
plan
or
something
else.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
there's
only
that--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--and
my
suggestion
is,
number
one,
that
there's
no
realistic
possibility
of
that
here.
but,
number
two,
that
that's
a--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
don't
think
so.
if
you
are
talking
about
a
defined
benefit
plan,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
any
increases
in
liability
simply
mean
that
the
employer
has
to--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
that
it
does,
but
i
think
that
it
could
quite
possibly
apply
differently,
for
example,
through
a
401(k)
plan
where
the
discrimination
would
have
occurred
at
a
time
when
people
are
making
running
contributions.
but
ultimately,
i
mean,
i
think
that
this
court
has
taken
into
account
those
kinds
of
things
at
the
remedial
phase,
where
you
have
an
opportunity
to
look
at
the
facts
about
how
this
would
affect
the
pension
in
this
case
or
pensions
generally.
there's
simply
no
evidence
here
to
suggest
that
there
are
those
kinds
of
problems,
because
very
few
employers
as
far
as
we
can
tell
continue
this
kind
of
discrimination.
most
have
eliminated
it
decades
ago.
and
we're
talking
about
a
small
subset
of
employees
and
relatively
small
amounts
of
money
with
respect
to
each
of
them.
so
i
think--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
first
of
all,
i
mean,
my
individual-named
clients
didn't
bring
those
claims
back
then;
and
they
lost,
the
union
that
brought
this
claim.
and
then
there
were
--
if
i
recollect
correctly,
they
were
challenging
at
that
moment
the
denial
of
their
disability
leave
payments.
they
weren't
coming
in
and
saying
simply,
you
know,
the
only
harm
we're
facing
now
is
the
prospect
in
the
future
of
a
lower
pension.
and
that's
the
kind
of
hypothetical
future
harm
that
we
don't
think
congress
would
have
intended
to
be
the
basis
of
a
lawsuit,
not
--
one
of
the
--
when
the
entire
purpose
of
enacting
706(e)(
2)
was
that
congress
was
concerned
not
to
require
employees
to
run
to
court
every
time
there
is
some
discrimination
that
affects
the
amount
of
their
seniority,
because
that
causes
a
disruption
to
the
employment
atmosphere,
it
creates
work
for
the
eeoc
and
the
courts,
and
in
many,
many
cases
the
marginal
difference
in
the
amount
of
the
seniority
credit
we
are
talking
about
here
will
make
no
big
difference
at
all
to
anything.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think
--
and
we
haven't
had
discovery
on
this.
i
think
there
is
a
fairly
linear
relationship
between
the
amount
of
leave
and
the
percentage
of
the
pension
check,
and
so
we're
talking
in
between--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--per
person?
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
no.
it
would
be
more
than
that.
it
would
be
about
half
of
a
percent
to
maybe
two
and
a
half
percent
per
person.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
it
could
be
millions
of
dollars.
and
the
plan
that--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--it's
a
small
amount
of
money
to
a
plan
that
has
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
in
it.
at&t's
last
report
to
the
sec
said
they
had
a
$17
billion
surplus
in
that
fund.
there's
no
question
that
this
is
going
to
bankrupt
this
particular
fund.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
the
distinction
between
703(h)
and
this
case
is
that,
in
this
case,
we
challenge
a
system,
a
seniority
system
that
is
itself
facially
discriminatory,
and
703(h)
says
that
doesn't
apply--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--it
does.
and
in
addition,
we
also
have
the
argument
that
the
ninth
circuit
accepted,
but
--
that
the
pda
on
its
own
terms
says,
that
703(h)
doesn't
apply
to
permit
discrimination
that
the
pda
itself
would
forbid.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
you
may
think
that,
but--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
that
in
the
end,
i
mean,
it's
worthwhile
to
focus
on
the
consequences
of
accepting
at&t's
view.
on
the
better
view,
it
depends
mightily
on
whether
an
employer
keeps
a
running
tab
on
seniority,
in
which
case
they
can
avoid
the
application
of
the
pda
because
it
made
the
calculation
beforehand,
and
an
employer
who,
at
the
end
of
an
employee's
career,
simply
tabulates
the
term
of
employment,
which
i
think
under
their
view
subjects
that
employer
to
the
current
requirements
of
the
pda.
and
we
respectfully
suggest
that
congress
wouldn't
intend
title
vii
to
turn
on
such
trivial
distinctions.
moreover,
under
their
view,
an
employer
who
--
an
employer
would
be
able
to
pay
black
workers
today
smaller
pensions
than
white
workers
who
provided
exactly
the
same
amount
of
service,
if
those
black
workers
started
working
for
it
before
title
vii
was
enacted,
at
a
time
when
the
employer
had
no
pension
system
for
blacks
and
didn't
give
them
any
seniority
credit.
that
employer
could
say
the
same
thing
at&t
says
here,
which
is
that
the
present
disparity
in
pension
benefits
is
simply
the
present
effect
of
discrimination
that
was
lawful
when
it
occurred.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--1964.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
there
are.
there
are,
but
it's
very
unlikely
that
there
are
very
many
of
them
subject
to
this
kind
of--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
let
me
reassure
you,
because
i
think
most
employers,
unlike
at&t,
have
--
don't
make
those
kinds
of
distinctions
with
respect
to
their
employees
who
were
hired
before
and
after
the
effective
dates
of
the
relevant
provisions
of
title
vii.
and
i
think
it's--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--yes,
that's
--
that's
right.
that
the
present
implementation
of
the
system
subjects
it
to
the
present-day
requirements
of
title
vii.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
the
difference
between
ledbetter
and
this
case
is
ledbetter
involved
discrimination
entirely
outside
of
the
seniority
system,
and
as
a
result,
it
didn't
--
706(e)(
2)
didn't
apply;
this
court's
decision
in
lorance
didn't
apply.
and
congress
enacted
this
706(e)
2)
to
provide
a
very
special
rule
to
displace
the
rule
of
evidence.
it
was
--
it
was
unambiguously
intended
to
displace
the
rule
of
evidence
with
respect
to
intentionally
discriminatory
seniority
systems.
evans
isn't
a
problem
because
the
rule
they
were
administering
in
evans
is
whoever
is
hired
is
in
fact
hired
at
low
seniority.
now,
it's
hard
to
say
that
that's
a
complicated
system
of
rules
that
had
a
pre-existence,
even
though
this
individual
was
where
she
was
because
of
that
earlier
system.
again,
i
think
the
distinction
between
evans
and
this
case
is
discrimination
that
occurred
entirely
outside
of
a
--
the
seniority
system
and
discrimination
within
the
seniority
system
that
gives
unequal
credit
for
equal
service.
and
congress
said
of
that
kind
of
discrimination
--
we're
not
going
to
make
you
challenge
immediately.
we're
going
to
let
you
wait
until
the
reduced
seniority
has
a
concrete
effect
on
your
compensation
or
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
and
then
you
can
raise
it
then.
and
the
underlying
thought
of
the
provision
is
that
if
you
are
subject
to
intentional
discrimination
with
respect
to
seniority
accrual,
we
are
going
to
impute
that
intent
to
the
subsequent
applications
of
that
seniority
system
when
it's
applied
to
injure
you.
and
if--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--we
make
alternative
arguments.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
we
argue
that
to
the
extent
it
matters
whethers
this
was
lawful
at
the
time
our
clients
took
their
leave,
it
was
not
unlawful,
and
we
point
to
satty.
but
we
say
ultimately
that
doesn't
matter
because
under
section
706(e)(
2),
so
long
as
they
implement,
so
long
as
they
rely
on
the
diminished
seniority
in
the
present,
that
constitutes
a
present
act
of
pregnancy
discrimination,
intentional
pregnancy
discrimination,
which
is
unlawful
under
the
pda.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
but
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
dispute
that
when
my
clients
had
their
seniority
reduced,
it
was
an
act
of
facial
pregnancy
discrimination;
and
under
702
--
706(e)(
2),
that
intent
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
is--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
do
think
it
was
unlawful,
but
it
doesn't
matter
with
respect
to
706(e)(
2).
if
i
could
turn
briefly
to
the
retroactivity
argument:
it's
important
to
be
clear
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
and
what
it
didn't
hold.
it
did
not
hold
that
at&t
was
liable
for
anything
it
did
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
pda.
it
didn't,
for
example,
hold
that
it
was
liable
simply
because
it
moved
the
ncs
dates
or
because
it
relied
on
them
in
any
way
before
the
effective
date
of
the
pda.
all
it
said
was
that
at&t
is
precluded
from
relying
on
that
discriminatory
measure
of
service
in
the
future.
and
in
that
sense,
this
case
is
quite
like
this
court's
decision
in
griggs
v.
duke
power
company,
where
the
court
said
title
vii
prohibits
employers
from
relying
on
the
results
of
discriminatory
employment
tests.
now,
nobody
thought
that
that
meant
that
title
vii
subjected
to
liability
employers
who
administered
or
relied
on
those
tests
before
the
effective
date
of
title
vii,
but
everybody
understood
that
they
couldn't
rely
on
those
results
after
the
effective
date
of
title
vii,
and
nobody
thought
that
that
gave
the
statute
a
retroactive
effect.
and
that's
all
that
the
ninth
circuit
interpreted
the
pda
to
do
here,
is
to
prohibit
at&t
from
engaging
in
the
post-act
reliance
on
those
pre-act
discriminatory
measures,
that
at&t
had
every
opportunity
to
conform
its
--
to
conform
its
conduct
to
the
--
to
the
requirements
of
the
pda,
and
a
statute
that
simply
tells
an
employer
how
it
has
to
treat
past
events
for
future
employment
decision
purposes
is
simply
not
a
statute
that
has
a
retroactive
effect.
finally,
i'd
like
to
--
if
i
have
time,
i'd
like
to
address
this
suggestion
from
the
solicitor
general's
office
that
this
doesn't
involve
seniority
discrimination
at
all
because
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
discrimination
that
occurred
with
respect
to
the
personnel
policy
about
the
classification
of
leave,
as
opposed
to
discrimination
within
the
seniority
system
itself.
and
this
court
was
clear
in
california
brewers
that
an
accrual
rule
that
says
how
time
counts
for
seniority
purposes
is
part
of
the
seniority
system.
and
under
at&t's
system,
it's
true
you
have
to
apply
a
two-part
rule.
you
have
to
know
whether
--
if
you
are
asked,
does
this
pregnancy
leave
count,
you
have
to
ask,
well,
is
it
personal
leave?
but
that
doesn't
tell
you
anything
until
you
apply
the
second
part
of
the
rule
that
says
pregnancy
leave
counts
as
--
as
personal
leave.
and
because
you
need
to
know
the
answers
to
--
to
both
of
those
questions,
both
parts
of
the
rules
are
properly
considered
to
be
part
of
the
accrual
rule
and
part
of
the
seniority
system.
finally,
if
i
--
if
i
could
return
once
again
to
this
alternative
argument
that
we
have,
that
even
setting
aside
bazemore
and
section
706(e)(
2),
this
is
not
--
our
clients
weren't
required
to
challenge
this
discrimination
before
because
it
wasn't
an
completed,
unlawful
employment
practice
at
the
time.
and,
again,
the
point
is
that
discrimination
with
respect
to
a
small
amount
of
time
going
towards
seniority
doesn't
affect
even
the
worker's
actual
seniority,
that
is,
her
place
in
the
seniority
hierarchy.
a
worker
who
is
2
years'
junior
to
the
person
who
is
next
in
line
above
her
and
2
years'
senior
to
the
person
next
in
line
below
her
--
6
weeks
of
service
credit
aren't
going
to
make
any
difference
with
respect
to
her
place
on
the
seniority
hierarchy.
it's
not
going
to
make
any
difference
with
respect
to
her
ability
to
bid
for
jobs.
and
it's
not
necessarily
even
going
to
make
any
difference
with
respect
to
her
pension,
because
at
the
time
that
these
leaves
are
taken
typically,
the
person
is
years
away,
perhaps
decades
away,
from
even
vesting
in
their
pension
benefit.
and
congress
reasonably
would
have
thought,
i
think,
that
that
kind
of
harm
is
too
speculative
to
warrant
immediate
--
to
warrant
the
requirement
that
the
employees
have
to
immediately
challenge
that
kind
of
discrimination
at
the
time
it
occurs.
that's
why
congress
enacted
section
706(e)(
2),
to
give
employees
an
opportunity
to
wait
until
the
discrimination
has
a
concrete
effect
on
their
employment
status,
on
their
compensation
or
terms
of
employment.
and
at&t's
view
of
the
statute--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
they
don't
have
a
choice.
they
can't
bring
the
claim
until
it
has
a
concrete
impact.
now,
if
706(e)(
2)
applies,
they
can
challenge
the
system
as
of
--
when
it's
adopted
or
when
it's
applied
to
them,
but
otherwise
they
have
to
wait
until
it
injures
them
within
the
meaning
of
section
706(e)(
2).
and
that's
a
perfectly
sensible
rule.
remember,
we're
talking
here
about
facial
discrimination,
and
the
concerns
about
stale
evidence
are
not
particularly
strong
here
because
--
and,
as
a
result,
we
are
able
to
stipulate
to
the
underlying
facts.
everybody
knows
what
the
system
was
and
what
it
did.
and
there's
no
reasonable
dispute
about
whether
the
reduction
in
our
clients'
leaves
was
as
a
result
of
pregnancy
versus
something
else.
and
in
any
event,
this
is
simply
a
consequence
congress
must
have
intended
when
it
said
that
discriminatory
seniority
systems
are
open
to
challenge
whenever
they
apply
to
injure
a
worker,
even
if
that
means
that
so
long
--
if
an
employer
implements
a
plan
for
30
years,
congress
understood
that
that
meant
that
they
were
subject
to
suit
for
30
years.
