stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
--
what
about
--
i'm
trying
to
work
with
this
distinction
where
i
agree
with
you
that
it's
hard
to
see
exactly
what
it
is.
but
if
i
look
at
bazemore,
i
think
there
we
have
a
large
number
of
employees.
and
if
you
look
at
a
complicated
thing,
a
salary
structure,
earlier,
you
see
that
that
salary
structure
systemically
paid
black
people
less
than
white
people.
and
at
the
time,
for
whatever
reasons,
there
wasn't
a
statute
--
we
assume
that
that
was
lawful
at
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
later
it
turns
out
that
they
are
keeping
that
salary
structure,
although
not
for
racially
motivated
reasons.
they
are
keeping
it
simply
because
that's
what
it
was.
and
the
court
says,
you've
taken
that
complex
structure,
and
you
are
administering
it
now,
and
the
administration
of
it
now
is
what
is
unlawful.
then,
look
at
your
case.
we
had
a
complicated
structure
involving
seniority,
really.
and
part
of
that
old
seniority
system
was
this
rule
which
was
legal
at
the
time.
it
is
no
longer
legal.
now,
we
move
that
structure
over
until
now,
and
we
see
we
are
administering
the
same
complex
structure
today
in
the
same
kind
of
way
that
was
at
issue
at
bazemore.
it's
a
complicated
set
of
rules
that
you
have
to
apply
today
in
order
to
see
who
is
entitled
to
what,
just
as
they
did
that
in
bazemore.
so
i
began
to
think,
doesn't
that,
on
the
key
matter,
look
very
much
like
bazemore?
what
is
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
you
are
not
saying
anything
that
is
in
effect
and
is
still
there,
you
do
retro,
you
win.
i
take
it
--
maybe
i
am
not
right,
but
i
take
it
that
what
--
what
the
point
is
here
is
that
you
--
you
took
a
complicated
superstructure
of
rules
that
was
creating
boxes
and
those
boxes
were
created
on
the
basis
of
discrimination.
then
you
move
it,
whole
cloth,
into
the
post-new
world.
and
it's
the
administration
of
that
complicated
system
of
rules
that
was
created
out
of
the
discrimination,
but
it's
administration
today
that
makes
it
like
bazemore.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does
that,
but
what
i
can't
figure
out
is
does
that
have
a
lot
of
implication
for
other
areas
or
not?
and
the
other
thing
i'm
not
sure
of
is
how
it
squares
with
ledbetter.
