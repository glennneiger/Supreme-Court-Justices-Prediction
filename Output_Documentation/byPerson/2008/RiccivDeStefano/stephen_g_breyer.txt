justice
stephen
g.

a
city
can
in
fact
choose
a
test
simply
because
there
will
be
more
minority
people
who
will
in
fact
end
up
in
the
positions,
that's
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
needn't
do
anything
else?
i
mean,
that
is
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
is
that
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
is
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
what's
the
difference
here?
the
most
that
you're
saying
is
the
worst
that
could
have
happened
here;
the
worst
that
could
have
happened
is
that
some
experts
told
them,
this
test
--
by
the
way,
test
one
is
--
is
even
worse
than
in
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical.
it's
a
test
that
probably
discriminates
negatively
against
minorities.
so
if
you
admit
he
could
do
it
even
if
the
test
didn't
discriminate
negatively
against
minorities,
namely
test
--
in
his
case,
why
can't
you
do
it
triply,
in
the
case
where
there's
evidence
that
they
did
discriminate,
the
test
does
discriminate
against
minorities?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
got
to
that,
then
i
have
--
i'd
like
one
follow-up,
and
that's
it.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
do
if
there
is
not
a
liability
in
question?
suppose
a
school
district
deliberately,
to
obtain
greater
racial
diversities
in
the
schools
draws
district
boundaries
in
a
particular
way
among
neighborhoods
or
plans
a
construction
program.
then
suppose
having
done
that,
indeed
having
once
drawn
the
boundaries,
a
group
comes
to
the
school
district
and
says
you
can
achieve
greater
diversity
if
you
redraw
the
boundary.
you
can
achieve
greater
diversity
if
instead
of
building
this
school
where
the
--
where
the
foundations
are
laid
already,
you
build
the
school
over
here
instead.
is
that,
in
your
view,
different
from
your
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is?
how?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
just
what
i'm
doing
exactly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
interested
in
the
distinctions,
not
whether
it's
similar
to
justice
thomas's
or
not.
i'm
interested
in
the
distinctions
between
this
program
--
i'll
add
one
more
if
you
want
just
this
program,
an
employer--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
difference
between
that
and
drawing
the
school
district
boundary,
which
takes
from
the
individual
children
who
live
in
that
neighborhood
the
right
to
go
to
this
school,
which
they
think
is
a
better
one,
and
sends
them
to
that
school,
which
they
think
is
a
worse
one,
the
difference
between
changing
that
boundary
and
changing
the
exam
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think
of
an
employer
who
does
the
following?
he
advertises
a
job.
everyone
comes
in
and
applies.
he
says
may
1
is
the
deadline.
when
he
sees
the
applicants,
he
thinks,
i'd
prefer
more
diversity.
and
solely
because
he
lacks
diversity
among
women,
minorities,
and
whatever,
he
says,
you
know,
i'm
going
to
extend
the
deadline
2
months,
and
i
hope
i'll
get
a
few
more
minority
or
female
applicants.
now,
what's
his
reason?
he
wants
more
diversity
in
the
workforce.
now,
in
your
opinion,
does
the
constitution
permit
that
extension?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
purposely
gone,
of
course,
to
the
concurring
opinion
because
i
believe
it's
the
controlling
opinion
in
parents
involved,
and
there
are
two
examples
in
that
opinion.
one
is
strategic
site
selection
of
new
schools,
i.e.,
a
planned
building,
and
the
second
is
drawing
attendance
zones
with
a
general
recognition
of
the
demographics.
those
are
given
as
examples
of
instances
where
there
is
race
consciousness,
but
it
does
not
trigger
strict
scrutiny.
now,
why
is
your
case
like
that
rather
than
being
like
those
examples
where
an
employer
or
a
government
official
picks
particular
people
or
uses
quotas
in
order
to
get
a
certain
quota
or
pay
attention
to
race
in
an
individual
selection,
both
based
on
race,
which
clearly
does
require
strict
scrutiny?
and
if
there
is
a
difference,
even
then
why
is
yours
justified?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
--
i'm
still
back
on
--
a
university
decides
that
tenure
requirements
lead
to
fewer
women
professors,
so
they
say
as
an
experiment
what
we
would
like
to
do
is
not
have
them
for
a
couple
of
years;
see
what
happens.
on
your
view
is
that
unconstitutional?
because,
after
all,
it
will
certainly
mean
that
certain
majority
race
assistant
professors
have
now
lost
the
promotion
they
otherwise
would
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
it's
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
oh,
oh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
we
are
doing
is
not
giving
the
promotions
to
the
assistant
professors
who
otherwise
would
have
job
security.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
result
--
it's
that
you
identify
the
person
that
makes
your
--
so
in
texas,
for
example,
they
take
the
top
10
percent
of
all
the
high
school
graduates
and
put
them
in
the
university.
now,
suppose
they
just
decided,
you
know
what
we
want
to
do?
the
top
5
percent.
we
want
to
see
how
that
works.
and,
of
course,
then
there
are
people
who
in
fact
would
have
gotten
into
the
university
--
and
perhaps
we
can
imagine
a
majority
of
the
majority
race
--
and
now
they
don't.
can
texas
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that,
but
i
--
i
----
[laughter]
that
was
not
my
objective.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
test
out
just
what
it
is
about
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
said
no.
can
texas
do
that
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
and
the
difference
here
precisely
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
your
--
in
my
example,
to
go
back,
the
thing
you've
identified,
it
seems
to
me,
is
texas
couldn't
do
this.
it
couldn't
look
at
the
class
that
they're
going
to
choose
with
the
10
percent
and
say,
you
know,
there
are
not
enough
minorities,
i
think
we'll
go
to
15
percent
this
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
could
not.
and
moreover,
in
the
case
of
the
tenure,
what
the
school
couldn't
do
is
it
couldn't
say,
looking
over
at
the
present
tenured
faculty
and
those
who
were
just
ready
for
promotion
and
who
in
all
probability
will
be,
we're
going
to
go
to
the
non-tenure
system
this
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
they
couldn't
do
that.
and
again
you
that
say
the
ordinary
employer
across
america
who
announces
a
deadline
for
getting
in
applications
cannot,
once
it
sees
those
applications,
say,
you
know,
there
are
not
enough
minorities.
i
want
to
extend
the
deadline.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
therefore
this
is
a
very
far-reaching
decision.
