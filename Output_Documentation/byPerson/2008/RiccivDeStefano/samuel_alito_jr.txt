justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
kneedler,
could
you
explain
how
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
defendants
on
the
title
vii
disparate
treatment
claim
can
possibly
be
affirmed,
even
if
the
employer
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
test
that
was
given
would
expose
itself
to
liability
under
a
disparate
impact
theory?
if
that's
not
the
employer's
real
reason
for
refusing
to
go
ahead
with
the
promotions,
then
isn't
there
liability
under
a
disparate
treatment
--
under
a
disparate
treatment
theory,
and
that's
a
question
for
the
jury?
so
how
can
we
possibly
affirm
summary
judgment
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
does
the
government
think
that
you
can
just
--
in
a
case
like
this
you
can
just
look
at
what
--
what
is
said
by
the
ultimate
decision-maker
and
ignore
the
input
from
other
people
who
may
have
influenced
the
process?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
all
the
employer--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
all
the
employer
has
is
evidence
that
the
test
results
violate
the
four-fifths
rule,
is
that
sufficient?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
i
could
modify
the
question.
is
there
some
statistical
point
at
which
that's
sufficient,
if
it's
not
four-fifths,
if
it's
nine-tenths--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
alone
would
be
sufficient?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
why
didn't
it
have
a
sufficient
basis
here?
it
--
it
chose
the
company
that
framed
the
test,
and
then
as
soon
as
it
saw
the
results,
it
decided
it
wasn't
going
to
go
forward
with
the
promotions.
the
company
offered
to
validate
the
test.
the
city
refused
to
pay
for
that,
even
though
that
was
part
of
its
contract
with
the
company.
and
all
it
has
is
this
testimony
by
a
competitor,
mr.
hornick,
who
said
--
who
hadn't
seen
the
test,
and
he
said,
i
could
do
a
better
test
--
you
should
make
the
promotions
based
on
this,
but
i
could
give
you
--
i
could
draw
up
a
better
test,
and
by
the
way,
here's
my
business
card
if
you
want
to
hire
me
in
the
future.
how's
that
a
strong
basis
in
the
evidence?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
difference
does
the
cut-off
score
make?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that,
but
the
people
at
the
top
would
--
the
problem
here
was
not
the
composition
of
the
people
who
scored
above
the
cut-off,
was
it?
it
was
the
composition
of
the
--
of
the
people
who
would
be
eligible
for
promotion
under
the
"rule
of
three"?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
that
would
be
so,
even
if
another
mr.
hornick
showed
up
and
said,
i
could
----
[laughter]
i
could
make
a
better
--
i
could
make
a
test?
and
here
are
some
problems
with
this
second
test
that
you
gave?
