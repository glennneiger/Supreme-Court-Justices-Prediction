justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this
question?
is
it
undisputed
that
it
was
a
race-based
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
contending
that
that's
an
issue
of
fact
that
has
to
be
tried
out
or
that
we
should
accept
your
version
of
that
--
of
that
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy?
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
about
the
two
alternatives,
one
of
which
would
fit
exactly
into
the
concluding
clause
of
the
first
question
presented
to
achieve
racial
proportionality
in
candidates
selected?
he
says
there
are
two
alternatives
before
the
school
board,
one
would
achieve
the
proportionality,
the
other
would
not.
are
they
free
to
choose
the
former?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
take
that
test,
even
though
its
sole
purpose
was
to
achieve
racial
proportionality
in
candidates
selected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
the
--
putting
to
one
side
liability
in
the
lawsuit,
is
the
interest
in
avoiding
disparate
impact
a
valid
state
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
say
compelling.
i
said
is
it
a
valid
state
interest.
just
the
interest
in
avoiding
the
kind
of
results
you
got
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
city
is
not
merely
trying
to
avoid
liability,
they
are
trying
to
avoid
a
disparate
impact.
is
that
a
valid
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
ask
you
this?
you
--
you've
recommended
that
we
set
aside
the
summary
judgment
and
send
the
case
back
for
a
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
issue
of
fact
that
you
think
needs
to
be
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
meade,
let
me
--
let
me
go
back
to
one
earlier
question.
suppose
everybody
agrees
that
you're
right
on
the
--
on
the
record
here
now,
and
the
city
goes
ahead
and
does
another
test,
with
all
the
advantages
and
studies
they've
made
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
and
it
turns
out
you
just
had
an
unfortunate
selection
of
candidates,
and
they
come
out
exactly
the
same
way.
would
you
agree
that
at
that
time
the
city
would
have
to
certify
the
results?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
test
they
made
after
talking
to
everybody
who
testified
in
this
case
and
filed
amicus
briefs
and
everything
else
----
[laughter]
and
they
came
out,
and
it
turned
out
exactly
the
same
results.
justice
john
paul
stevens
absolutely
what?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
would
have
to
certify
it.
