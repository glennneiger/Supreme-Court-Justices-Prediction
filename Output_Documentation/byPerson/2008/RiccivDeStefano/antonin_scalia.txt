justice

scalia
they
would
not
have
discriminated
against
any
particular--
justice
antonin
scalia
--white
or
--
or
majority
applicants
in
--
in
that
selection,
which
is
what
occurred
here.
you
had
--
you
had
some
applicants
who
were
winners,
and
their
--
their
promotion
was
--
was
set
aside.
that
doesn't
exist
in
these
hypotheticals
at
all.
it's
just
an
abstract
question
of
which
of
these
two
systems
should
be
adopted.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
one
of
the
briefs
said
that,
and
maybe
it
wasn't
done
below,
but
one
of
the
briefs
said
part
of
the
claim
is
that
some
of
the
things
that
this
test
tested
for
were
not
--
were
not
qualities
or
abilities
that
were
needed
in
new
haven,
although
they
might
be
needed
in
other
fire
departments.
the
test
had
not
been
localized.
wasn't
that
part
of
the
--
part
of
the
objection?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
hear
his
answer
to
this
one
first?
i'm
getting
confused.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
at
war
with
one
another.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
one
avoid--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it
looks
like
or
if
the
employer
just
in
good
faith
believes?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
i
say
they're
at
war
with
one
another,
i
mean
they
become
at
war
with
one
another
when
you
say
that
all
that
is
necessary
to
permit
intentional
discrimination
is
the
employer's
good
faith
belief
that
if
he
didn't
intentionally
discriminate,
he'd
be
caught
in
a
situation
of
disparate
impact.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
that
point,
they're
at
war
with
each
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
a
reasonable
response
to
that,
is
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
just
in
response
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
reasonable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you
would
say
that
--
and
i'm
asking
the
same
question
the
chief
justice
asked
earlier
--
you
would
say
that
if
it
had
come
out
the
other
way--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
if
there
had
been
a
disproportionate
number
of
minorities
who
--
who
passed
the
test--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
would
say
that
it's
neutral
to
set
that
test
aside?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
you'd
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
whether
it
is
--
it
is
neutral
to
set
aside
a
test
simply
because
one
race
predominates.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
you
can
call
that
race-neutral
i
--
i
do
not
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
a
controverted
issue
of
fact?
how
can
you
possibly
get
around
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
one
side
says
what
you
say
is
just
pretext;
the
real
reason
was
just
politics.
isn't
that
an
issue
of
fact
that
has
to
be
tried?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
you
can
call
it
facially
neutral.
it's
neutral
because
you
throw
it
out
for
the
losers
as
well
as
for
the
winners?
that's
neutrality?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
you're
not
saying
that
--
that
the
test
is
--
is
compliance.
you're
--
you're
saying
the
belief
that
it's
necessary
for
compliance
is
a
compelling
state
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
everybody
would
probably
concede
that
if
--
if
continuing
would
clearly
be
in
violation,
of
course,
it's
a
compelling
interest.
but
the
issue
here
is:
is
it
enough
if
the
employer
simply
worries
that
if
he
doesn't
make
the
change,
he
may
be
in
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what's
the
line
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
acknowledge
strong
basis
in
evidence
is
--
is
what
--
what
the
city
has
to
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
just
said
that.
i
just
thought
you
just
--
i
was
--
almost
wrote
it
down.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
absolutely
positively?
[laughter]
