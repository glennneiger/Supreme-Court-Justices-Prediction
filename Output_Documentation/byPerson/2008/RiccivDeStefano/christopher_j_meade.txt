mr.
christopher
j.
meade
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
employers,
both
private
and
public,
are
required
to
comply
with
title
vii's
disparate
impact
provisions,
which
seek
to
root
out
barriers
to
equal
opportunity.
when
an
employer
learns
that
a
practice
has
a
severe
adverse
impact
such
that
it
creates
an
inference
of
discrimination,
and
evidence
further
supports
that
inference,
the
employer
should
be
granted
some
limited
degree
of
flexibility
to
act.
an
employer
certainly
should
not
be
encouraged
or
forced
to
make
a
promotion
on
the
basis
of
the
questionable
practice.
title
vii's
disparate
impact
provisions
are
designed
to
remove
structural
barriers
to
discrimination,
and
when
an
employment
practice
has
an
adverse
impact
such
that
it
substantiates
an
inference
of
discrimination,
an
employer
should
look
beyond
that
adverse
impact.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
in
our
view
it
is
not
sufficient,
and
that
is
not
what
was
at
issue
here.
first
of
all,
there
was
a
severe
adverse
impact,
much
lower
than
the
four-fifths
rule,
much
lower
than
what
this
court
found
in
connecticut
v
teal,
and
in
addition,
not
just
on
the
pass/fail
ratio--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--our
view--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--our
view
is
that
it
might
be
conceivable
under
title
vii
in
some
cases
for
the
statistical
disparity
to
be
so
severe
such
that
it
would
give
an
employer
a
reasonable
basis
under
title
vii.
however,
that's
not
what
we
argue
here.
we
argue
here
that
an
employer
should
be
able
to
act
when
it
has
a
severe
adverse
impact
which
creates
an
inference
of
discrimination,
coupled
with
evidence
that
creates
doubts
about
the
flaws
in
the
test
or
the
possibility
of
alternatives.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
two
answers,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
this
race
consciousness
is
race
consciousness
that's
mandated
by
federal
law.
this
is
not
a
discretionary
decision
by
an
employer.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
the
difference
in
those
cases
that
you
talk
about,
croson,
adarand,
parents
involved,
they
involve
express
racial
quotas
--
excuse
me,
express
racial
classifications,
where
the
government
is
making
a
decision
based
on
a
particular
individual
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
no,
because
it's
a
facially
neutral
action
which
applies
to
all
test
takers
the
same.
that
doesn't
mean--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--no,
i
would
say
that
there's
no
classification.
however,
there's
another
way
to
trigger
strict
scrutiny
and
that
comes
under
cases
like
arlington
heights
and
feeney,
and
the
action
that
the
--
the
facially
neutral
action
that
the
city
took
here
falls
under
that
line
of
cases.
and
then--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--there
is
no
classification,
because
each
individual,
and
--
when
a
particular
individual
is
looked
at
and
a
decision
is
made
on
the
basis
of
race,
that
is
a
racial
classification.
if--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well,
the
point
is,
if
all
the
tests
are
being
thrown
out
and
different
decisions
are
not
being
made
on
the
basis
of
different
individuals
on
the
basis
of
race,
then--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well,
two
responses.
the
first
response
is
a
legal
one,
the
second
one
is
a
practical
one.
as
to
the
legal
answer,
if
a
city
were
to
do
that
or
an
employer
were
to
do
that
again
and
again,
first
of
all,
that
would
go
to
intent,
whether
the
intent
of
the
employer
were
actually
to
comply
with
title
vii
or
for
some
other
intent.
second
of
all,
it
would
speak
to
whether
there
are
actually
equally
valid
less
discriminatory
alternatives.
second,
the
practical--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well,
that
would
be
a
question
about
whether
they
had
a
reasonable
basis
to
do
it.
and
i
would
say
if
they
did
it
a
second
time,
that
could
create
an
inference
of
discrimination.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
justice
ginsburg,
this
is
information
outside
the
record,
of
course.
the
--
the
city
has
held
tests
for
other
positions,
both
written
and
oral,
in
assessment
centers
that
have
not
had
a
severe
disparate
impact
--
actually,
that
have
not
had
an
adverse
impact
at
all
under
the
four-fifths
rule.
and
specifically
for
the
lieutenants
and
captains,
what
the
city
has
been
forced
to
do
is
have
temporary
acting
promotions
on
a
rotating
basis
based
on
seniority.
but
the
city
has
not
gone
forward
with
any
promotions
yet,
and,
in
fact,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
may
in
the
end
receive
some
or
all
of
the
promotions.
but
the
city
has
a
duty
to
make
sure
that
its
process
is
fair
for
all
applicants,
both
black
and
white.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
justice
breyer,
there
are
two
ways
to
enter
strict
scrutiny.
one
is
a
racial
classification
which
makes
different
decisions
based
on
different
individuals
on
the
basis
of
race.
cases
like
croson
or
wygant
or
even
affirmative
action
plans
are
examples
of
making
different
distinctions
based
on
different
individuals
on
the
basis
of
race.
there
is
another
line
of
cases
about
--
where
there's
a
discriminatory
purpose
plus
adverse
impact
on
a
certain
group
under
the
arlington
heights
line
of
cases.
here
the
petitioners
argue
that
there
is
an
adverse
impact
on
them.
of
course,
that
depends
on
the
assumption
that
there
was,
in
fact,
a
valid
test.
but
here,
then,
under
that
line
of
cases
the
question
is:
what
is
the
discriminatory
purpose?
and
this
court's
cases
are
not
clear
about
what
a
discriminatory
purpose
is
under
the
arlington
heights
line
of
cases.
however,
the
answer
to
your
question
is:
compliance
with
a
federal
statute,
even
a
race
conscious
federal
statute,
cannot
be
deemed
a
discriminatory
purpose
under
the
arlington
--
arlington
heights
inquiry.
it
is
very
different.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
no,
your
honor.
if
strict
scrutiny
applies,
then
the
question
is:
is
there
a
compelling
interest?
and
complying
--
complying
with
a
federal
statute
needs
to
be
a
compelling
interest
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
reason
is,
otherwise,
state
and
local
governments
would
be
in
an
impossible
position
of
trying
to
determine
whether
they
should--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well
--
well,
i
would
disagree.
that
would
only
be
true
if
there
were
some
doubt
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
disparate
impact
provisions.
but
here
that
--
this
court
first
articulated
"disparate
impact".
congress
has
reaffirmed
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
i
--
i
may
have
misunderstood
the
question,
but
compliance
with
federal
statutes
have
to
be
a
compelling
interest
as
long
as
that
--
that
statute
is
constitutional.
now--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--or--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well,
the
line
is
set
out
by
this
court's
cases.
so
assuming
strict
scrutiny
applies
and
assuming
that
compliance
with
title
vii
is
a
compelling
interest,
then
the
question
is
whether
an
employer
has
a
sufficient
basis.
and
this
court's
cases,
both
in
the
intentional
and
unintentional
context,
say
that
that's
a
strong
basis
in
evidence,
and
so
that
would
be
the
relevant
test.
this
court
has
applied--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--assuming
that
strict
scrutiny
applies--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--then,
yes,
then
the
city
needs
to
have
a
strong
basis.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
again,
this
is
a
question
about
what
triggers
strict
scrutiny,
and
compliance
with
the
title
--
compliance
with
the
federal
statute
should
not
be
deemed
a
--
a
discriminatory
purpose.
however,
if
strict
scrutiny
applies,
then
this
court's
traditional
strict
scrutiny
analysis
is
a
way
to
test
the
decision.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
again,
all
of
those
other
cases
involved
discretionary
actions
by
state
actors,
and
those
are
--
were
making
decisions,
trying
to
comply,
trying
to
further
various
goals,
and
in
those
cases
making
a
very
express
use
of
race
that
a
particular
individual
--
when
that
person
was
looked
at,
whether
in
croson,
whether
in
wygant,
whether
in
parents
involved,
a
particular
decision
was
made
as
to
that
individual.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
the
--
the
difference
there
is
that
in
that
case,
jones
and
smith,
different
decisions
were
being
made
on
the
basis
of
race
such
that
there
was
a
labeling
on
the
basis
of
race.
and
here
there
is
no
such
labeling
because
here
there
is
a
question
about
whether
this
process
is
in
fact
picking
the
most
qualified
individuals
for
the
job.
and
that's
what
title
vii
is
designed
to
do.
it
is,
yes,
certainly
a
race
conscious
decision,
a
race
conscious
statute.
but
what
title
vii
is
trying
to
do
is
to
make
sure
that
we
don't
perpetuate
discrimination,
albeit
unintentional,
and,
therefore,
to
take
away
barriers
that
have
existed
over
time
and
that
continue
to
exist.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
we're
not
saying
that.
we
did
not
say
that
below.
and,
in
fact,
the
board
members
who
voted
against
certification
cited
flaws
with
the
test
and
flaws
with
the
process,
and
that
was
the
basis
for
their
failure
to
certify.
and
the
problem
with
a
discriminatory
test
is
that
it
does
not
set
a
level
playing
field.
it
may
create
an
illusion
of
meritocracy,
but
the
problem
is
it
not
only
disfavors
certain
individuals,
but
on
the
flip
side,
it
also
necessarily
advantages
others--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--and
therefore--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--no,
not
at
all.
the
ultimate
validity
of
the
test,
our
position
below,
was
not
relevant;
the
question
is
what
was
before
the
board.
and
the
board
heard
5
days
of
testimony
over
2
months.
and
as
i
mentioned,
the
two
individuals
who
voted
against
certification
cited
concerns
with
the
test
and
concerns
with
the
process,
and
that
was
the
basis
for
their
decision.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
to
answer
your
first
question,
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation,
i
would
disagree
with
the
suggestion
that
that
gives
support
to
the
petitioners'
side,
and
for
the
following
reason:
congress
made
a
careful
judgment
about
what
can
and
can't
be
done
once
tests
have
been
administered,
and
it
told
employers
it
--
it
can't
alter
the
scores
when
those
scores
are
being
used.
and
in
--
what
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--but
the
--
but
the
point
is
that
that
ties
the
hands
of
employers
so
that
the
employer,
in
fact,
is
limited
in
what
it
can
do.
just
because
a
test
has
been
administered
doesn't
mean
that
title
vii's
disparate
impact
provisions
suddenly
disappear.
and
as
a
number
of
lower
courts
have
stated,
there's
no
entitlement
to
be
promoted
on
the
basis
of
a
flawed
or
discriminatory
test.
the
problem
is,
the
alternative
is
to
force
employers
to
go
forward
and
to
use
a
discriminatory
or
a
potentially
discriminatory
test.
that
has
two
problems.
first,
it's
inconsistent
with
the
goal
of
merit-based
selection;
and
second
of
all,
if
it
turns
out
that
there
is,
in
fact,
discrimination,
a
court
then
needs
to
undo
that
discrimination.
a
court
will
often
need
to
use
racial
quotas
or
set-asides
to
try
to
undo
or
to
remedy
the
discrimination
that
has
happened.
so
it's
much
better
for
an
employer
to
stop,
to
not
go
forward
with
discrimination,
even
after
the
test
has
been
used,
rather
than
to
rush
forward
and
to
create
potentially
further
discrimination
and
a
more
aggressive
use
of
race
down
the
road.
another
problem
with
creating
a
high
standard
is
it
will
discourage
employers
from
removing
barriers
to
equal
opportunity.
for
example,
with
respect
to
an
ongoing
practice,
if
an
employer
learns
that
that
practice
has
a
disparate
impact,
but
is
not
sure
one
way
or
another,
and
gets
rid
of
that
provision,
under
petitioners'
theory
that
employer
will
necessarily
be
liable
to
either
blacks
or
whites.
the
only
way
that
it
can
defend
against
a
lawsuit
by
whites
would
be
to
argue
that
it
was,
in
fact,
violating
the
disparate
impact
rights
of
black
americans.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
i
mean,
it
could
--
could
be,
for
example,
if
there
were
a
five-part
training
program
that
the
city
or
an
employer
set
up,
and
individuals
may
have
completed
some
portion
of
the
training
program
such
that
there
would
be
similar
reliance
interests
like
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--exactly.
but
then
the
question
is
whether
you're
forced--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--no,
it
doesn't.
the
question
is
whether
the
employer
had
a
sufficient
basis
at
the
time
of
its
action
to
make
a
determination
that
the
test
should
not
be
used.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
first
of
all,
the
city
did
not
act
on
the
basis
of
numbers
alone.
it
had
5
days
of
hearings
where
it
heard
from
stakeholders
on
all
sides.
and
it
heard
numerous
flaws
in
the
test
at
those
hearings.
for
example,
there
were
arbitrary
weightings
of
the
scores
which
had
no
scientific
basis;
the
company
skipped
critical
design
steps
in
the
process;
and
although
this
was
not
before
the
board,
it
later
turned
out
that
there
was
no
calibration
in
either
the
cut-off
score
or
how
the
test
was
ultimately
going
to
be
used.
previous
tests
had
a
much
less
severe
adverse
impact.
this
test
was
an
outlier.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
the
difference
of
a
cut-off
score
is
a
determination,
a
scientifically
based
determination
to
determine
who
is
qualified
and
who
is
not
qualified
for--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well,
two
responses,
justice
alito.
first
of
all,
as
to
the
pass-fail
rate,
that
could
create
a
separate
disparate
impact
violation
under
federal
law.
so
that
was
relevant
for
separate
purposes.
but
in
addition,
it's
also
true
that
the
test
was
not
calibrated
for
use
for
rank
ordering,
to
ensure
that
a
93
was
better
than
a
91.
and
this
was
a
special
problem
because
of
an
intervening
decision
by
a
court
that
was
--
that
was
rendered
after
the
tests
were
designed,
after
the
tests
were
taken,
after
the
tests
were
scored.
there
was
--
there's
no
evidence
that
the
tests
were
precise
enough
to
be
able
to
determine
who
--
who
should
rank
higher
versus
lower
based
on
those
scores.
and
the
amicus
brief
of
the
human
resources
--
human
resources
professionals
points
out
this
point.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes
and
no--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--no,
no.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
to
answer
in
a
way
that's
consistent
to
--
to
both
of
you,
the
answer
is
if
the
test
is
under
title
vii,
strong
basis
should
not
be
the
standard.
this
court
has
never
indicated
that
it
should
be.
and
that
would
be
much
too
high
of
a
standard
to
place
on
private
employers.
however,
if
this
court
concludes
that
strict
scrutiny
applies,
which
we
think
it
should
not,
but
if
this
court
concludes
that
strict
scrutiny
does
apply,
then,
yes,
we
agree--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
we
agree
with
the
government's
articulation
of
the
standard
of
reasonable
basis.
again,
i
would--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--i
agree
that
it
could
be
something
less
than
that.
and
if--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--no,
not
that
they
might
--
might
be
sued.
again,
this
is,
just
in
the
title
vii
context,
so
this
will
affect
all
private
employers,
some
of
which
will
be
small
employers
where
a
single
human
resource
professional
will
be
trying
to
make
the
determination.
there
won't
be
hearings
as
there
were
in
this
case.
and
the
question
is
sometimes
a
severe
prima
facie
case
could
be
sufficient
under
title
vii,
not
under
the
strong
basis
standard,
but
potentially
under
title
vii.
and
if
a
human
resource
professional
or
if
an
employer
had
a
belief
that
further
investigation
could
yield
evidence
of
a
title
vii
violation,
that
would
be
sufficient
under
the
reasonable
basis
standard.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
no,
it's
not
because
this
is
a
way
to
reconcile,
under
title
vii,
the
two
provisions
of
this
statute.
however,
in
this
case--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well,
i
would
disagree.
no,
it
is
not
a
blank
check.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
here,
however,
we
had
much
more.
there
was
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
here.
this
court,
under
the
strong
basis
standard,
has
suggested
that
a
strong
basis
is
met
when
the
threshold
conditions
for
liability
are
met.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
bush
v.
vera,
a
plurality
in
bush
v.
vera,
as
well
as
abrams
v.
johnson.
the
question
is
how
to
apply
that
standard
to
this
case.
that
standard
would
suggest
that
a
prima
facie
case,
which,
again,
is
not
just
adverse
impact
alone,
but
it's
adverse
impact
that
creates
an
inference
of
discrimination
could
be
enough.
here
we
have
not
just
that,
not
just--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--assuming
that
it
was
a
test
that
was
valid--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--absolutely.
if
the
petitioners--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--absolutely
yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
absolutely
positively.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
yes,
because--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--yes,
they
--
they
need
to
certify
the
--
the
results.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
they
would
have
to
certify
the
results.
sorry
i
was
unclear.
they
would
have
to
certify
the
--
the
results.
the
question
here
is
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
fair
process.
it's--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well,
not
on
the
basis
of
--
of
the
investigation
that
justice
stevens,
i
understood,
hypothesized,
as
part
of
the
example.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
again,
having
gone
through
all
the
different
examples
that
justice
stevens
said,
at
that
point
then
--
then
it
would
be
--
the
city
would
need
to
go
forward
with
the
test.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
thank
you.
