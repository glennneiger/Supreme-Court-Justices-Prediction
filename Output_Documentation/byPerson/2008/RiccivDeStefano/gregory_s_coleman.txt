mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
racial
classifications
are
inherently
pernicious
and,
if
not
checked,
lead
as
they
did
in
new
haven
to
regrettable
and
socially
destructive
racial
politics.
neither
equal
protection
nor
title
vii
justified
new
haven's
race-based
scuttling
of
the
promotions
petitioners
earned
through
the
civil
service
process
mandated
by
connecticut
law.
the
lower
court
required
no
strong
evidentiary
basis
that
the
city
was
acting
to
remedy
or
avoid
any
actual
discrimination,
but
strong
safeguards
are
needed
to
smoke
out
illegitimate
uses
of
race
and
to
extinguish
the
racial
favoritism
that
civil
service
laws
--
excuse
me
--
are
intended
to
prevent.
governmental
employment
actions
grounded
in
race
must
be
strictly
scrutinized
because
they
engender
divisiveness
and
cause
race-grounded
harm
that
the
constitution
seeks
to
avert.
that
standard
does
not
change
with
the
race
of
those
the
government
seeks
to--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--no,
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
city
makes
the
argument
that
it
was
not
a
race-based
decision
simply
because
the
effect
of
the
scuttling
resulted
in
no
promotions
being
given
at
all.
we
believe
that
that
is
not
a
basis
for
distinguishing
this.
that
it
still
remains
a
race-based
decision.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
believe
that
that's
an
issue
of
law,
your
honor.
it
is
no
different
ultimately
than
what
the
court
concluded
in
croson.
this
type
of
an
argument
that
a
do-over
is
not
a
racial
classification
is
exactly
what
happened
in
croson.
there
was
a
do-over
declared,
a
--
a
rebidding;
and
yet
the
court
said,
because
that
rebidding
was
declared
for
racial
reasons,
it
would
nevertheless
be
subjected
to--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--if
that
decision
was
grounded
in
a
determination
that
we
simply
need
to
ensure
that
there
are
more
women
on
the
force,
then,
yes,
it
would
be
subjected
to
heightened
scrutiny,
maybe
not
strict
scrutiny
under
that--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
think
your
question
gets
to
part
of
the
heart
of
this
case,
and
that
is,
ultimately:
is
the
decision
that's
being
made
one
that
is
--
is
based
in
race
or
is
--
is
based
on
a
determination
that
there
is
an
improper
test?
but
this
decision
is
grounded
in
race
if
--
if
the
police
department
in
your
case
had
clear
evidence
that
the
test
was
simply
unnecessary,
that
it
was
not
job-related
and
could
be
clearly
done
by
an
identifiable
alternative,
i
think
at
the
end
of
the
day
there
might
be
some
basis.
but
if
it
is
grounded
in--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--to
use
the
constitutional
analogy,
your
honor,
i
think
wygant,
croson,
adarand,
other
cases,
make
clear
that
you
do
not
have
to
prove
the
violation
against
yourself,
but
you
do
have
to
demonstrate
that
you
have
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
for
believing
you
are
violating
the
law.
in
wygant
the
plurality
set
that
out
citing
convincing
evidence.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
no,
i
completely
disagree
with
that,
justice
souter.
it
not
simply
a
matter
of
good
faith.
the
use
of
race
in
government
is
so
--
the
court
has
been
so--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
also--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
disagree
with
that
as
well,
justice
souter.
there
is
a
strong
difference
in
what
happened
in
this
case.
in
partial
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
et
al.,
this
is
not
an
issue
where
the
--
where
the
city
had
before
it
and
was
making
a
determination
that
our
examination
is
not
job
related.
in
fact,
it
is
clear
on
the
record
that
what
the
city
said
is,
this
comes
to
the
wrong
racial
result,
and,
therefore,
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
the
test.
when
pressed--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--under
our
alternative
argument,
your
honor,
assuming
that
--
that
fixing
disparate
impact
can
be
a
compelling
interest,
we
believe
that
you
would
at
least
have
to
demonstrate
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
to
show
that
there
is
liability
under
(k)
(
2)
--
your
--
your
example--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--under
the
armstrong
basis
of
evidence
test,
it
might
very
well
be
because
it
meets
the
second
qualification
of
the
disparate
impact
statute,
in
which
there
is
a
specific
alternative
that
is
equally
valid.
if
you
are
--
if
you
are
going
to
assume
that
it
can
be
shown
to
be
equally
valid
and
that
it
has
less
disparate
impact--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
we
are
certainly
quite
troubled
that
the
court
would
say,
as
it
has
not
said,
that
the
idea
of
--
of
overcoming
purely
unintentional
discrimination
can
be
a
compelling
interest
for
cutting
off
what
we
believe
is
intentional
discrimination.
but
barring
that,
our
test,
our
backup
test,
is
then
that
the
strong
basis
in
evidence
test
that
exists
from
wygant
and
croson
would
at
least
in
its
--
require
that
you
have
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
for
demonstrating
liability
under
this--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--under
that
argument,
as
long
as
it
can
be
demonstrated
to
be
equally
content
valid,
equally
or
better
content
valid
and
to
have
a
lesser
impact,
then
it
would
show
--
it
would
establish
a
stronger--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well,
i
understood
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
to
be
after
you
have
taken
a
test
and
building
upon
the
hypothetical.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
it
was--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--if
--
if
in
your
situation
is
simply
in
your
situation
the
initial
giving
of
the
test,
can
you
choose
between
those
two
tests,
then
we
believe
based
upon
what
the
court
has
said
in
the
past
that
a
city
could
do
that.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--nobody
can
know
in
fact--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--under
that
hypothetical,
we
believe
they
can
choose
that
test.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
two
very
strong
differences,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
our
--
our
firefighters
had
already
taken
the
test;
they
had
earned
their
promotions
under
state
law.
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
but
to
ministerially
certify
the
lists,
all
right?
the
second
difference
is
this.
the
only--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--we're
not
claiming
that
it's
a
vested
right.
what
we're
claiming
is
that
sometimes
the
court
has
permitted
governments
to
use
race
to
remedy
discrimination,
and
what
would
be
needed
in
that
hypothetical,
your
honor,
is
--
is
the
discrimination;
and
under
your
hypothetical
there
might
very
well
be
a
strong
case
of
discrimination,
but
under
these
facts
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record,
and
the
city
conceded
below
and
never
asserted
in
its
bio
in
this
case
that
it
had
any
basis
to
contest
the
job-relatedness
of
this
examination
or
these
examinations
that
were
given.
that
is
not
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
the--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--no,
your
honor,
not
in
the
district
court.
if
you
look
at
1024a
of
the
pet.
app.,
the
city's
lawyer
in
front
of
the
district
court
and
in
its
pleadings
on
summary
judgment
very
clearly
states
that
they
didn't
believe
the
job
relatedness
is
even
relevant
to
the
case.
all
that
they
needed
was
good
faith.
they
didn't
need
job
relatedness,
they
didn't
need
an
actual
alternative,
which
is
the
basis
of
some
of
the
hypotheticals
you're
giving.
all
they
need
is
good
faith.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
justice
ginsburg,
that's
not
at
all
what
mr.
hornick
said
in
front
of
the
civil
service
board.
what
he
said
is
first,
i
didn't
look
at
the
test;
two,
i
looked
at
the
results
and
i
see
disparate
impact;
three,
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
what
exams
we
gave,
but
i'm
mentioning
this
thing
called
an
assessment
center,
but
i
could
design
a
better
test,
not
having
even
looked
at
this
test.
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
also
said,
i
think
you
should
go
ahead
and
give
these
promotions
and
in
the
future
maybe
you
could
fix
your
test.
he
didn't
say
here's
an
alternative;
here's
why
this
would
be
equally
valid,
here's
why
--
excuse
me
--
here's
why
this
would
have
lesser
impact.
he
simply
said
there
is
a
concept
called
an
assessment
center,
and
i
think
that
that
might
help
you
in
the
future,
but
you
should
go
ahead
and
give
the
promotions
on
this
test.
same--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
i
actually
think
i
got
to
the
--
the
first.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
again
--
again,
getting
to
the
--
the
fundamental
point
is,
the
use
of
race
is
so,
so
very
important
that
the
court
has
always
expressed
skepticism
and
hostility
to
it,
and
what
we're
saying
under
this
argument
regarding
a
strong
basis
in
evidence,
and
i
think
this
answers
both
your
hypothetical
and
justice
souter's,
is
that
what
the
city
is
saying,
we
don't
have
to
demonstrate
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
for
liability,
we
concede
that
we
don't
have
that;
all
we
have
is
good
faith.
and
that's
not
enough.
that
leads--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that's
not
our
intention,
justice
souter.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
our
argument
is
clearly
that
this
is
not
race-conscious,
that
it
is
race-based.
the
only
determination
that
the
city
made
is
we
don't
like
the
results
of
this
test;
there
must
be
something
different
that
we
can
do;
and
we
don't
need
to
demonstrate--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--viability
or
strong
basis
in
evidence.
we
can
simply
fix
it.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
but
it
--
it
clearly
is,
justice
souter.
i
think
the
distinction
we're
making
in
part
is
this
principle
of
individual
dignity
that
the
court
has
recognized
is
so
strong
distinguishes
the
hypothetical
that
justice
kennedy
gave
me
from
--
form
the
example
that
we
have
in
this
case
where
they
had
already
taken
the
test;
identifiable
individuals
had
earned
their
promotions;
and
then
the
city
says
too
many
non-minorities
passed
this
test,
and
we
are
going
to
scuttle
these
results
based
on
identifiable
individuals
who
have
passed
and
not
based
on
any
--
anything
approaching
a
demonstration
that
there
is
actually
any
disparate
impact
liability.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--justice
souter,
i
understand
the
concern
about
the
employer's
point
of
view,
which
we
don't
think
stands
here
just
because
of
the
blatant
way
the
city
went
about
this.
but
in
general
terms
we're
not
asking,
contrary
to
wygant,
contrary
to
croson,
that
you
prove
up
a
claim
against
yourself.
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
standard
cannot
be
so
light
that
the
city
very
lightly
and
without
any
demonstration
whatsoever
that
there
might
actually
be
liability
here,
based
simply
on
the
numbers,
can
say
well,
we're
going
to
avoid
liability
and
we're
going
to
favor
the
minority
group
over
the
non-minority
group.
all
we're
asking
for
is
that
the
city
undertake
an
honest
and
--
and
open
assessment
of
are
we
really
likely
to
be
liable
here
under
the
disparate
impact
provision
of
title
vii.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
think--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
think
it
is.
i
think
you're
giving
examples
from
justice
kennedy's--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--it's
--
it's
really
isn't
different
from
justice
thomas
also
had
an
example
in
grutter.
these
are--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
think
the
court
is
certainly
not
fully
in
agreement
on
these
questions,
but
the
court
has
at
least
an
opinion
suggested
that
those
types
of
examples
really
are
more
of
--
as
justice
souter,
you
were
saying,
the
race-conscious
type
determination,
and
they
don't
violate
this
principle
of
individual
dignity.
you're
not
taking
individuals
one
by
one
who
have
already
earned
promotions,
and
you're
taking
away
benefits
from
them
clearly
on
the--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--the
difference
that
the
court,
i
believe,
has
suggested
is
that
that
type
of
a
redrawing
is
likely
to
include
a
number
of
traditional
redistricting
factors
and
that
race
in
that
instance,
unless
it
was
shown
to
ultimately
predominate,
would
not
make
it
a
race
--
or,
excuse
me,
a
race-based
effort
that
would
violate
equal
protection.
i
believe
that's--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--of
course.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
again,
assuming
that
no
test
has
previously
been
given,
if
there
are
two
tests,
they
are
equally
valid,
one
can
be
demonstrated
to
have
lesser
disparate
impact,
if
there
are
no
other
circumstances,
then
we
think
they
could
likely
under
that
test--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
disagree
that
its
sole
purpose
would
be
for
that
reason,
justice
stevens.
as
long
as
it
meets
the
other
criteria
for
job
relatedness,
it
would
still
be
fulfilling
the
city's
necessary
needs
for
--
for
identifying
quality
candidates
for
making
sure--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--we
certainly
have
taken
the
position
if
disparate
impact
is
identified
purely
as
unintentional
discrimination,
then
we
don't
believe
it's
a
compelling
state
interest
to
overcome--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i'm
not
sure
that
we
are
questioning
whether
there's
a
state
interest
in--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--if
the
disparate
impact
is
caused
by
something
that
could
be
demonstrated
to
equate
to
discrimination
on
behalf
of
the
entity,
which
is
what
the
elements
of--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--there
are
two
aspects
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
is
that
you
may
have
disparate
impact
if
it
is
caused
by
unintentional
discrimination.
but
you
may
have
disparate
impact
that
occurs
through
no
discrimination,
intended
or
otherwise.
and
watson
clearly
recognized
that.
and
when
watson
said
we
need
to
have
strong
evidentiary
standards
in
evaluating
disparate
impact
liability,
it
was
recognizing
that
employers
can't
act
simply
to
fix
numerical
disparities,
because
otherwise
that
leads
to
soft
quotas.
what
we
need
is
some
demonstration
that
there
is
at
least
discrimination
on
behalf
of
the
entity,
and
perhaps
that's
unintentional,
perhaps
it's
not.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
congress
has
spoken
on
this
issue,
has
identified
job
relatedness
and
lack
--
and
the
refusal
of
an
alternative
in
k
itself.
we
believe
this
is
with
the
provisions
we
have
cited,
h,
j
and
l,
all
in
which
congress
expressed
a
strong
intent
to
favor
tests.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
there's
another
statute
that
the
court
ought
to
consider
in
the
title
vii
context,
and
that's
section
2000e-7,
which
says
that
title
vii
will
not
overrule
and
pre-empt
state
law
unless
there
is
a
violation
of
title
vii.
in
asserting
that,
under
any
reasonable
basis,
as
long
as
they
have
a
reasonable
basis,
they
can
dispense
with
all
the
provisions
of
connecticut
civil
service
law,
all
these
provisions
that
were
put
in
place
to
get
rid
of
cronyism,
to
get
rid
of
discrimination
can
be
set
aside
based
on
nothing
more
than
a
numerical
disparity
or
perhaps
a
concern
about
the
test
we
think
cuts
against
congress's
intent
in
title
vii
in
respecting
these
state
and
local
laws
that
are
intended
to
ensure
that
employment
practices
are
fair
and
that
they
choose
and
select
those
who
are
best
qualified
to
put
into
these
very
important
first-responder
organizations.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
think
consistent
with
the
answer
i
gave
you
before,
justice
breyer,
that
based
on--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--based
on
that
alone--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--no,
it
would
not
be.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
it--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--you're
not
taking
away
tenure
from
anybody.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
you're
just
saying
we
want
to
change
the
tenure
process.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
the
analogy
to
your
analogy
is
that
if
we
have
a
series
of
people
who
go
through
the
tenure
process
that
exists
and
it
turns
out,
you
know,
we
--
we
don't
like
the
results,
and--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--therefore
we
want
to
change
it.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well,
you've
chosen
a
very
controversial
subject.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
if--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--if
--
if
that
is
not
done
on
the
--
on
the
basis
of
race,
then,
no.
the
institution
of
the
10
percent
rule
itself,
most
people
believe--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--likely,
yes.
the
answer
is--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--it
can
do
it.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
is
that,
under
state
law,
these
individuals
had
gone
through
an
existing
process
and
had
--
under
state
law,
had
been
determined
to
be
the
most
qualified
candidates
and,
barring
anything
else,
would
have
been
promoted.
so
the
classification
that
is
made
clearly
does
distinguish
between
those
who
are
qualified
for
promotion
and
those
who
are
not
qualified
for
promotion
and
would
not
receive.
it
violates
that
--
that
singular
principle
of
individual
dignity
to
have
these
individuals
be
told,
on
the
basis
of
race,
you're
not--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--if--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
don't
think
that's
what
we've
said,
justice
ginsburg.
under
our
alternative
formulation
in
which
the
court
recognizes--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--the
difference
is
this,
justice
ginsburg:
the
example
you
have
given
would
clearly
satisfy
or
likely
satisfy
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
that
you
are
actually
in
violation
of
the
disparate
impact
provision
of
title
vii.
there
are
three
prongs.
the
first
is
adverse
impact;
the
second
is
that
your
test
is
not
related;
and
the
third
is
the
existence
of
this
alternative
that
is
equally
valid
and
that
results
in
lower
disparate
impact.
the
city
has
never
asserted
--
and
i
hear
it
today
continue
to
say,
we
don't
have
to
show
those
other
two
prongs,
that
a
numerical
disparity
enough
may
allow
the
city
to
conclude
that
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
the
test.
this
kind
of
res
ipsa
loquitur
theory
of
disparate
impact
is
one
that
the
courts
have
not
recognized
and
that
watson
said
we
cannot
allow
because
it
results
in
racial
balancing
and
soft
quotas
based
on
disparate
impact--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that
i
agree
with,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
also
agree
with
that.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
that's
also
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
no,
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
okay,
what--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--if--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
don't
think
that's
our
position,
justice
souter.
the
first
case
i
think
is
the
hypothetical
justice
kennedy
posed
to
me.
the
second
case,
as
we've
been
talking
about,
is
that
you
identify
the
disparate
impact
after
the
test
has
been
given.
under
this
alternative
theory
that
would
allow
a
--
an
employer
to
respond,
all
we
are
asking
under
the
strong
basis
in
evidence
test
is
that
you
not
react
out
of
a
concern,
or
out
of
this
mere
reaction
to
the
numbers,
but
that
you
then
look,
is
the
test
valid?
do
you
have
convincing
evidence,
in
the
words
of
wygant,
to
form
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
that
if
you
did
go
forward--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--consistent
with
what
--
my
conversation
with
justice
breyer,
if
they
see
it
coming
and
do
it
ahead
of
time,
it
doesn't
violate
that
principle
of
individual
dignity
and
that
--
and
doesn't
discriminate
against
particularized
and
identifiable
individuals.
