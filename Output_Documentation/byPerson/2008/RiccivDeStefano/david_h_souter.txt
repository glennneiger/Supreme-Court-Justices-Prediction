justice
david
h.

the
problem,
mr.
coleman,
is
that
--
that
the
cases
you
are
relying
on,
it
seems
to
me,
are
cases
in
which
ultimately
what
is
being
judged
is
a
different
result
in
the
--
at
the
end
point
of
the
process
which
was
starting.
and
the
problem
that
i
have
with
--
with
using
cases
like
that
and
--
and
essentially
the
problem
i
--
i
have
with
your
argument
is
that
it
leaves
a
--
a
municipality
or
a
governmental
body
like
new
haven
in
a
--
in
a
damned
if
you
do,
damned
if
you
don't
situation.
because
on
--
on
the
very
assumptions
that
you
are
making,
if
they
go
forward
with
--
with
their
--
their
hiring
plan,
they
certify
the
results
and
go
forward
with
it,
they
are
inevitably
facing
a
disparate
impact
lawsuit.
if
they
stop
and
say,
wait
a
minute,
we're
starting
down
the
road
toward
a
disparate
impact
lawsuit
and,
indeed,
there
may
be
something
wrong
here,
they
are
inevitably
facing
a
disparate
treatment
suit.
and
whatever
congress
wanted
to
attain,
it
couldn't
have
wanted
to
attain
that
kind
of
a
situation.
why
isn't
the
most
reasonable
reading
of
this
set
of
facts
a
reading
which
is
consistent
with
giving
the
city
an
opportunity,
assuming
good
faith,
to
start
again?
and
i
--
i
recognize
there's
got
to
be
a
good
faith
condition,
and
the
--
the
good
faith
can
always
be
attacked.
but
isn't
that
the
only
way
to
avoid
the
damned
if
you
do,
damned
if
you
don't
situation?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
make
no
distinction
between
race
as
an
animating
discriminating
object
on
the
one
hand
and
race
consciousness
on
the
other.
there
is
no
way
to
deal
with
a
situation
like
this
any
more
than
there
is
a
way
to
deal
with
--
with
setting
lines
in
voting
districts--
justice
david
h.
souter
--without
pervasive
race
consciousness.
that
is
not
unconstitutional,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
not
observing
that
distinction
in
--
in
your
reply.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
--
what
if
you've
got
--
what
if
you've
got
the
basis
of
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical?
you've
--
you've
got
a
municipality.
it's
a
racially
mixed
municipality.
it's
got
two
tests.
that's
his
hypothetical.
one
of
them
seems
to
suggest
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
significant
racial
disparity
in
the
results
if
they
use
it.
the
other
one
from
the
other
city
or
the
other
state
suggests
not.
that's
all
they've
got
to
go
on.
is
that
a
strong
basis
in
evidence,
or
did
they
walk
their
way
into
a
lawsuit
by
you
if
they
adopt
the
--
the
test
that
doesn't
--
that
at
least
in
the
other
place
hasn't
produced
the
disparity?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
are
--
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
imposing
your
strong
basis
in
evidence
test
on
what
you
referred
to
a
second
ago
as
the
use
of
race,
and
that
cannot
be
correct,
because
the
use
of
race
includes
race-conscious
decisions
which
are
not
discriminatory
decisions,
and
they
certainly
do
not
implicate
the
--
the
obligation
that
you
want
to
impose.
you
--
if
--
if
your
argument
is
going
to
be
coherent
with
what
we
start
with,
it
can't
be
based
merely
on
the
use
of
race
because
if
it
does,
then
you
are,
in
effect,
turning
any
race-conscious
decision
into
a
discrimination
decision,
and
that
equation
we
certainly
haven't
made
and
we're
never
going
to
make.
justice
david
h.
souter
then--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
even--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
don't
want
to
turn
this
into
just
a
rhetoric
exercise,
but
i
think
the
rhetoric
is
important.
you
say
the
city
took
the
position,
we
don't
like
the
results
of
this
test.
that
kind
of
a
statement
is
consistent
with
saying,
look,
we
don't
like
the
race
of
the
people
who
are
going
to
benefit
from
this.
it's
also
consistent
with
the
city's
taking
the
position
that
there
is
such
a
racial
disparity
here
that
we
are
either
asking
for
trouble
or
walking
blindly
or
perhaps
foolishly
into
a
--
a
racial
disparity
lawsuit
based
on
disparate
impact.
those
are
two
very,
very
different
attitudes.
the
first
one
is
discriminatory.
i
don't
see
how
the
second
one
is
discriminatory.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
cost
of
drawing
the
distinction
between
this
case
and
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
example
is
that
if
we
draw
that
distinction,
the
only
way
the
city
can
get
itself
out
of
not
only
a
certain
lawsuit,
but
quite
probably
a
successful
lawsuit,
is
to
make,
in
practical
terms,
a
preliminary
case
against
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
--
i
cannot
conceive
that
congress
intended
to
put
a
city
into
that
situation
saying
you've
either
got
to
blunder
ahead
into
a
losing
lawsuit
in
court,
or
you
have
got
to
stop
and
expose
yourself
to
another
lawsuit
which
you
can
only
win
by
proving
that
you
at
least
had
taken
some
steps
in
violating
the
law
the
first
time.
that
is
inconceivable.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
your
phrase
was
--
i
think--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
does
it
have
to
be
reasonable
basis
to
believe
they
would
be
liable
if
they
went
ahead?
or
can
reasonableness
refer
to
something
other
than
the
probability
of
or
the
--
the
likelihood
of
liability?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
are
--
you
are
saying,
as
i
understand
it,
that
if
the
--
if
the
city
in
a
case
like
this,
prior
to
giving
a
test,
looked
at
the
test
and
says,
wait
a
minute,
this
is
going
to
produce
really
disparate
results,
they
can
stop,
regroup,
and
think
it
through
again
and
maybe
come
up
with
a
different
test.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
they
don't
realize
that
and
they
go
ahead
with
the
test,
and
they
then
see
the
--
the
disparate
results,
it's
too
late.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
trouble
with
drawing
that
distinction
is
that
the
city
is
not
in
the
testing
business.
they
are
unlikely
to
know
what
the
results
are
going
to
be.
so
you're
saying
that
the
city
that
is
--
that
is
prescient
can
adjust,
the
city
that
doesn't
find
out
there's
something
wrong
or
at
least
undesirable
from
their
standpoint
until
after
the
test
results
cannot
readjust?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
they
see
it
coming,
they
don't
have
to
show
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
for
changing
the
test
prior
to
the
time
they
give
it?
