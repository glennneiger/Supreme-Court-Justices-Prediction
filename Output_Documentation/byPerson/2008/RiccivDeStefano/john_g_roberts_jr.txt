chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
today
in
case
07-1428,
ricci
v.
destefano,
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
coleman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you
assuming--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--are
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--counsel,
some
time
ago
you
said
you
had
two
answers
to
justice
breyer's
question.
i
would
like
to
hear
the
second
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
if
you
don't
mind,
you
could
remind
me
what
the
second
answer
was.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
coleman.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with
respect
to
both
blacks
and
whites,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
can
you
assure
me
that
the
government's
position
would
be
the
same
if
this
test
--
black
applicants
--
firefighters
scored
highest
on
this
test
in
disproportionate
numbers,
and
the
city
said
we
don't
like
that
result,
we
think
there
should
be
more
whites
on
the
fire
department,
and
so
we're
going
to
throw
the
test
out?
the
government
of
united
states
would
adopt
the
same
position?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
part
i
don't
understand.
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
department
can
engage
in
intentional
discrimination
to
avoid
concern
that
they
will
be
sued
under
disparate
impact.
why
doesn't
it
work
the
other
way
around
as
well?
why
don't
they
say,
well,
we've
got
to
tolerate
the
disparate
impact
because
otherwise,
if
we
took
steps
to
avoid
it,
we
would
be
sued
for
intentional
discrimination?
this
idea
that
there
is
this
great
dilemma
--
i
mean,
it
cuts
both
ways.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
this
may
be
the
same
question
justice
breyer
asked,
but
i'd
like
something
closer
to
a
yes
or
no
answer.
does
the
government
consider
promotion
of
diversity
by
itself
a
compelling
state
interest
in
the
employment
context
as
opposed
to
the
school
context?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
it
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--can
it
be
advanced
by
taking
actions
to
avoid
what
is
perceived
as
a
disparate
impact?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
disparate
impact
is
regarded
as
something
you
can
intentionally
respond
to
by
drawing
racial
distinctions
solely
because
you
would
like
a
more
diverse
workforce?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
didn't
care--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
didn't
care
--
it
had
to
draw
racial
distinctions
because
it
looked
at
the
test
and
said,
we
think
there's
a
problem
because
of
the
racial
makeup
of
who's
going
to
get
the
promotions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
didn't
look
at
names;
it
just
looked
at
the
label
of
what
their
race
was.
that's
all
they
were
concerned
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
meade.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
ask
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--can
i
ask
you
to
touch
on
the
distinction
between
racial
discrimination
and
race-conscious
action?
the
actions
that
were
taken
in
many
of
our
cases,
in
croson
and
adarand,
parents
involved,
wygant,
were
obviously
race-conscious
actions;
there
was
a
reason
that
the
governments
in
those
cases
were
taking
the
action.
it
was
because
of
what
they
saw
as
the
impact
on
race.
yet
we
concluded
that
was
racial
discrimination.
so
what's
the
--
how
do
you
draw
the
line
between
race-conscious
that's
permitted
and
racial
discrimination
that's
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
if
we
--
if
we
agree
with
your
--
i
mean,
you're
assuming,
it
seems
to
me
in
your
argument,
that
the
actions
that
they've
taken
here
are
not
intentional
racial
discrimination;
and
of
course
if
they're
not,
then
you
don't
have
much
to
worry
about.
but
let's
assume
that
they
are,
as
we
found
they
were
in
croson
and
wygant
and
adarand
and
parents
involved.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
only
reason
you
say
that
isn't
by
an
individual
is
that
you
have
blacked
out
the
names?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
position
is
what?
they
threw
out
the
test,
so
you
would
have
no
problem
at
all
if
they
looked
at
those
results
and
they
were
predominantly
black
rather
than
white;
you
would
say
the
city
can
throw
out
the
test
and
there's
no
racial
discrimination
there
at
all?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
case
would
come
out
differently,
if
the
list
was
there
with
then
names
and
they
go
down
and
instead
of
saying
throw
out
the
test,
they
said
jones,
you
don't
get
the
promotion
because
you're
white;
johnson,
you
don't
get
it
because
you're
white.
and
they
go
down
the
list
and
throw
out
everybody
who
took
the
test;
then
that
would
be
all
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
they
can
keep
--
they
get
do-overs
until
it
comes
out
right?
or
throw
out
this
test;
they
do
another
test;
oh,
it's
just
as
bad,
throw
that
one
out;
get
another
one
that's
a
little
better,
but
not
so
--
throw
that
one
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
if
--
how
many
times
before
it's
a
problem?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
if
they
did
it
over
and
over
again.
what
if
they
did
it
twice
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
--
i
am
sorry.
is
that
correct
if
we
--
we
conclude
strict
scrutiny
does
apply
under
the
constitution?
compliance
with
a
statute,
looking
at
impact,
is
a
compelling
interest
trumping
strict
scrutiny
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
it
would
go
to
how
you
construe
the
statute.
it
seems
to
me
an
odd
argument
to
say
that
you
can
violate
the
constitution
because
you
have
to
comply
with
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
get
back
just
--
just
--
since
i
don't
understand
it
yet,
the
distinction
between
intentional
racial
discrimination
and
race
conscious
action.
i
thought
both
the
plurality
and
the
concurrence
in
parents
involved
accepted
the
fact
that
race
conscious
action
such
as
school
siting
or
drawing
district
lines
is
--
is
okay,
but
discriminating
in
particular
assignments
is
not.
now,
why
is
this
not
intentional
discrimination?
i
understood
you
to
say
it
was
because
you
don't
have
particular
individuals
being
treated
on
the
basis
of
their
race.
you
are
going
to
have
to
explain
that
to
me
again,
because
there
are
particular
individuals
here.
they
are
the
plaintiffs,
and
they
say
they
didn't
get
their
jobs
because
of
intentional
racial
action
by
the
--
the
city.
why
is
that
not
on
the
racial
--
intentionally
racial
discrimination
side
rather
than
the
permissible
race
consciousness
side?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
--
you
may
be
right
that
that's
what
the
question
is
about.
i
still
don't
have
in
my
mind
from
you
a
line
about
how
we
decide.
because
there
are
many
cases,
croson,
adarand,
wygant,
parents
involved,
where
we
said
action
taken
obviously
because
of
race
is
nonetheless
discrimination.
so
--
and
then
there
are
cases
where
we
have
recognized
that
race
conscious
action
is
permissible.
again,
what
--
when
i
look
at
something
like
this,
how
i
do
decide
which
side
of
the
line
that's
on
--
this
is
on?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
just
to
take
parents
involved,
it
wasn't
a
necessary
--
the
driving
factor
was
not
a
specific
decision
with
respect
to
specific
individuals.
they
didn't
care
whether
it
was
jones
or
smith
that
they
were
citing.
all
they
cared
about
was
the
race.
and
it
seems
the
--
the
same
here.
you
maybe
don't
care
whether
it's
jones
or
smith
who
is
not
getting
the
promotion.
all
you
care
about
is
who
is
getting
the
promotion.
all
you
care
about
is
his
race.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
just
referred--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
you
just
referred
to
a
discriminatory
test.
what
you
said
in
the
district
court,
and
i
quote,
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
tests
were
valid.
are
you
just
changing
positions
on
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
type
of
--
what
type
of
other
things
are
you
talking
about
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
question,
i
guess,
would
be
whether
the
program
was
valid
or
not
under
the
traditional
approaches
you
take
under
title
vii.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
does
your
position
here
depend
on
a
conclusion
that
this
test
is
invalid?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
response
to
me
that
you
don't
have
to
show
that
the
test
is
invalid,
your
argument
is
you
just
have
to
show
that
there's
a
basis
for
being
worried
that
it
might
be
invalid.
and
then
it
seems
to
me
the
only
distinction
is
how
high
a
showing
you
require.
and
you
reject
the
idea
that
you
have
to
show
a
strong
basis
in
the
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
from
--
i
guess
i
should
say
i
understand
from
your
brief
if
not
from
your
argument
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
agree
with
the
strong
basis
in
fact
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
guess,
my
--
so
my
--
your
position
is
that
you
should
never
have
a
strong
basis
in
fact
standard,
because
you
don't
think
strict
scrutiny
should
apply,
and
you
think
if
it's
under
title
vii,
it's
only
reasonableness?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
position
is
that
the
city
--
the
--
the
government
can
take
action
without
--
only
if
it's
reasonable.
it's
a
reasonable
view
of
whether
or
not
they
might
or
might
not
be
liable.
that's
the
standard.
and
then
they
can
engage
in
race-based
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
is
something
less
than
that,
that
they
might
be
sued?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
kind
of
a
blank
check
to
discriminate,
if
all
they
need
is
a
reasonable
basis
to
think
that
further
investigation
might
be
useful?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
sorry
--
that's
an
answer
about
why
it
would
be
okay.
i'm
just
saying,
isn't
it
in
fact
a
blank
check?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
still
--
i
still
don't
have
absolutely
yes
--
of
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
they
can--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
just
to
get
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
stevens,
you
say
they'd
have
to
certify
it.
you
say
that,
in
that
situation,
the
decisionmaker
could
not
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
thinking
further
investigation
is
required.
why?
just
because
the
second
test
came
out
the
same
way?
it's
not
at
all
reasonable
to
think
they
ought
to
look
at
it
further?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
coleman,
to
keep
the
time
even
here,
i
think
you
have
8
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
07-1428,
ricci
versus
destefano
and
the
consolidated
case.
