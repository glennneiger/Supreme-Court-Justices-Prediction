mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
title
vii
prohibits
not
only
intentional
discrimination
but
acts
that
are
discriminatory
in
their
operation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
let
me
--
your
question
had
two
parts
of
it.
you
said
there
are
too
many
blacks
or
too
many
whites.
that
is
not
a
permissible
objective
under
our
view.
the
employer's
action
has
to
be
tied
to
a
concern
about
a
violation
of
the
disparate
impact
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--under
--
under
title
vii.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
to
--
to
say
that
an
employer
violates
the
disparate
treatment
provision
of
title
vii
when
it
seeks
to
--
when
it
acts
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
the
disparate
impact
provisions
of
title
vii
would
be
to
set
those
two
mutually
reinforcing
provisions
of
title
vii
at
war
with
one
another,
contrary
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
one
of
the
purposes
of
--
of
the
disparate
impact
test,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
is
--
is
as
a
prophylactic
against
intentional
discrimination,
to
root
it
out;
also,
as
this
court
said
in
watson,
to
identify
possible
instances
of
subjective
or
--
excuse
me,
subconscious
discrimination,
and
in
some
cases,
to
break
down
barriers
that
have
existed
in
the
past,
for
example,
possibly
the
60/40
weighting
requirement
that
was
under
longstanding
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
disparate
impact
test
has
been
recognized
since
griggs
as
fundamental
to
fulfilling
the
purposes
of
title
vii.
title
vii
also
has
another
important
objective,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized,
which
is
that
the
voluntary
compliance
is
the
preferred
objective
--
excuse
me
--
preferred
means
of
achieving
the
objectives
of
title
vii.
employers
therefore
require
considerable
flexibility
in
assessing
their
practices
and
deciding
on
appropriate
action
if
it
looks
like
one
of
their
actions
--
their
practices
would
violate--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
think
--
we
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
--
in
our
view,
the
--
in
--
in
the
situation
here
where
the
--
where
the
test
has
been
given,
and
there
is
a
list
produced,
we
believe
that
the
--
in
order
to
avoid
summary
judgment
and
a
disparate
treatment
case
on
a
claim
of
intentional
discrimination,
the
employer
would
have
to
show
that
his
concerns
were
reasonable
ones.
it
has
to
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--more
than
simply
a
disparate--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
--
for
example,
a
--
a
gross
statistical
disparity.
a
statistical
disparity
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
under
title
vii.
we're
not
saying
that
in
all
cases
simply
a
statistical
disparity
would
be
sufficient.
a
gross
statistical
disparity
could
lead
the
--
the
employer
to
believe
that
something
was
wrong
with
the
test.
so
i
think
--
but
in
addition
if
the
employer
has
concerns
about
the
validity
of
the
test
--
as
you
pointed
out,
concerns
were
expressed
to
the
civil
service
board
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we're
--
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
court
should
affirm
summary
judgment.
we're
--
we're
suggesting
remand.
the
district
court
identified
reasons
other
than
complying
with
title
vii's
disparate
impact
standard
for
the
employer's
action
here,
diversity
and
role
model,
promotion
of
role
models
which
we
do
not
see
as
falling
within
this
framework.
but
if
the
only
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
has
that
the
employer
took
race
into
account
was
that
the
employer
was
aware,
as
obviously
the
disparate
impact
provisions
require
him
to
be,
of
the
racially
disparate
impact
of
the
test,
and
the
employer
acts
in
response
to
that,
if
that
is
the
only
evidence
the
--
the
plaintiffs
had,
then
the
employer
would
be
entitled
to
summary
judgment.
we
think
that
the
evidence--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
think
that
evidence
of
pretext
or
evidence
that
there
is
something
else
has
to
be
external
or
something
other
than--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
it's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
it's
not
reasonable,
then
we
think
that
that
would
be
evidence
of
--
of
pretext
--
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
they
go
primarily
to
the
district
court's
identification
of
diversity
and
--
and
role
models
as
possible
motivations
for
what
the
--
what
the
employer
was
doing.
the
plaintiffs
have
also
alleged
that
the
--
that
there
was
influence
on
the
civil
service
board
external
to
the
--
to
the
board's
own
decision.
by
the
way,
i
should
point
out
in
this
regard,
at
pages
166
and
167
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
two
board
members
who
voted
not
to
certify
expressed
concerns
about
the
validity
of
the
test
based
on
what
they
had
heard
at
the
hearing.
we
don't
think
realistically
a
board
in
this
situation
should
be
required
to
do
more,
because
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
--
what
the
employer
did
here
was
not
what
concerned
the
court
in
wygant
and
cases
like
this.
the
court
--
the
employer
did
not
adopt
racial
classifications
with
all
the
potential
for
adverse
consequences
for
individuals
who
are
labeled
by
race
and
promote
on
the
basis
of
race.
that's
not
what
the
employer
did
here.
the
employer
paused
and
decided
that
there
might
be
another
nondiscriminatory
or
less
discriminatory
means.
in
other
words--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
--
we
don't
think
so,
and
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
action
that
the
employer
has
taken
in
response,
as
i
just
said,
is
not
a
racial
classification
response.
it
is
a
facially
neutral
response
where
the
--
where
the
employer
has
decided
the
test
will
--
perhaps
we'll
look
for
another
standard
which
would
be
given
and
applied
equally
to
all
applicants.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
we
--
and
we--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
we
--
there
also
has
to
be
some
concern
that
the
test
may
not
be
job-related
and
--
and
that
there
may
not
be
other
alternatives.
and
we've
been
talking
just
about
the
prima
facie
case,
but
those
are
important
elements
as
to
whether
the
test
is
job-related.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but
the
--
but
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
facially
neutral.
i
wanted
to
make
the
point
that
this
is
not
the
sort
of
intentional
discrimination
favoring
one
individual
because
of
his
race
or
disfavoring
another.
what
the
employer
has
done
here
is
--
is
responded
to
the
impact
of
the
test
in
general
terms,
not
on
specific--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
--
i
think
that's
a
more
difficult
question,
but
there
may
--
there
may
be
a
situation
where
the
employer
is
concerned
that
his
recruitment
or
his
job
announcement
has
had
a
disparate
impact
in
terms
of
the
--
of
the
applications
that
he
has
gotten.
in
--
in
that
situation,
the
employees
who
have
responded
and
may
be
advantaged,
like
the
people
promoted
here
may
actually
be
taking
advantage
of
a
test
that
imposes
barriers
and
disadvantages
other
people.
so
when
--
when
we
consider
the
impact
in
a
situation
like
this
on
somebody
who
has
passed
the
promotion
test,
it's
important
to
consider
that
the
people
who
have
passed
it
may
have
benefited
from
a
test
that
is
discriminatory.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
think
--
we
think
it
probably
is
a
compelling
state
interest,
but
it
is
not
one
that
--
that
can
be
advanced
by
race
--
by
racial
classifications.
and
that
--
and
that
is
our
basic
submission
here.
this
was
not
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--this
was
not
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
not
drawing
racial
distinctions.
that's
our
--
this
--
the
employer's
response
here
did
not
draw
racial
distinctions.
it
did
not
say
so
many
black
firefighters
would
be
promoted--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
so
many
white--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
employer
was
responding
to
the
discriminatory
test
or
what
--
what
it
was
reasonably
concerned
was
a
discriminatory
test--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
the
individual--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
--
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
with
respect,
it
did
not
classify
according
to
race;
it
looked
in
general
terms.
it
did
not
have
the
names
of
individual
people.
it
looked
in
general
terms
at
what
the
racial
disparity
of
the
test
was.
it
just--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--title
vii's
disparate
impact
test
requires
--
requires
an
employer
to
be
aware
of
and
respond--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the
employer
--
the
employer
was
not
making
a
decision
to
go
forward
and
appoint
individuals
or
promote
individuals
because
of
their
race.
the
employer
stopped
there
and
said
we're
going
to
start
over.
that
new
test
would
be
given
equally
to
all
employees,
not
any
one
particular
employee.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
as
i've
mentioned
to
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
it
would
go
--
there
are
several
things.
one,
it
would
go
to
the
justifications
that
were
advanced
by,
that
identified
by
the
district
court
here
that
do
not
fit
into
this
framework,
do
not
fit
into
complying
with
the
title
vii
disparate
impact
test,
and
those
are
promotion
of
diversity
and
--
and
role
models.
that
is
--
that
is
one.
also
the
district
court
did
not
apply
what
we
believe
is
the
right
test,
whether
the
employer
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
what
it
was
doing
was
necessary
or
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
it
might
be
violating
the
disparate
impact
test.
if
it
did
not
have
a
reasonable
basis
then
we
believe
there
would
be
a
triable
issue
for
the
jury.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
that
--
the
district
court
rejected
that
argument
and
whether
or
not
that
should
be
revisited
on
remand
is
--
is
another
matter.
we're--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
under
this
--
under
this
court's
decisions
dealing
--
dealing
with
summary
judgment,
even
on
questions
of
intent,
the
--
the
plaintiff
ordinarily
has
to
come
up
with
some
affirmative
evidence
that
there
was
--
that
there
was
in
this
case
an
impermissible
racial
motive
to
do
that.
and
the
--
the
district
court
looked
at
what
the
civil
service
commissioners
said
and
concluded
that
--
that
they
did
not
have
an
impermissible
racial
motive,
that
they
were
responding
to
concerns
about
the
validity
of
--
of
the
test.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
no,
we
do
not.
there
may
be
other
people
who
had
input
into
the
process,
and
whether
the
--
the
district
court
evaluated
that
and
concluded
that
the
--
that
the
input,
that
there
was
not
a
triable
issue
for
summary
judgment
--
to
avoid
summary
judgment
on
that
question.
that
would
be
open
to
the
district
court
to
reconsider
on
remand.
we
don't
deny
that
--
that
it
could
go
beyond
that,
but
our
principal
concern
here
is
the
analytical
framework
that
an
employer
who
seeks
to
comply
with
the
disparate
impact
requirements
of
title
vii
which
have
been
longstanding
should
not
be
teamed
to
have
engaged
in
the
sort
of
intentional
discrimination
that
either
the
equal
protection
clause
or
title
vii
prohibits.
