justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
--
this
question,
and
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
your
answer,
but
it
is
based
on
what
justice
souter
and
justice
ginsburg
have
both
been
asking.
hypothetical
case:
the
city
says,
our
test
is
not
very
good.
we
need
a
new
test.
the
expert
says,
don't
pay
us
to
have
a
new
one.
there
are
two
great
ones
out
there.
one
is
in
city
a.
the
other
is
in
city
b.
use
either
one
of
those.
they
are
great.
they
check.
they
find
out
that
city
a
has
a
disparate
impact
in
the
statistical
sense,
not
in
the
legal
sense;
that
it
disadvantages
minorities,
at
least
if
you
look
at
the
passage
rates.
the
other
test
doesn't.
are
they
permitted
to
take
the
test
that
doesn't
have
that
differential?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
--
my
question
is
--
and
you
can
answer,
i
guess,
both
under
title
vii
and
--
and
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
city
says,
the
only
reason
--
the
only
reason
for
our
selecting
the
test
from
city
b
--
and
both
tests
are
very
good
tests
--
is
because
minorities
are
better
represented
on
the
passing
rate.
is
that
permissible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
do
you
find
--
and
do
you
find
any
constitutional
deficiency
in
the
city's
choice
in
that
hypothetical
case?
is
there
any
fourteenth
amendment
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
it
was--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
was
designed
to
show,
and
maybe
it's
theoretical,
but
i
want
to
know
the
answer
so
that
i
can
understand
this
case.
it's
designed
to
ask
you
the
question
whether
or
not
race
consciousness
is
ever
permissible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
counsel,
you
know,
i've
given
law
school
examinations,
looked
at
them,
and
bar
examinations
for
years.
there's
never
been
one,
when
i
don't
look
at
it
after
the
fact
and
say,
you
know,
this
could
be
better,
this
--
this
was
not
quite
right.
so
shouldn't
there
be
some
standard
that
there
has
to
be
a
significant,
a
strong
showing
after
the
test
has
been
taken
that
it's
deficient?
before
it
can
be
set
aside?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
looked
at
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--counsel,
it
looked
at
the
results,
and
it
classified
the
successful
and
unsuccessful
applicants
by
race.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
--
and
you
want
us
to
say
this
isn't
race?
i
have
--
i
have
trouble
with
this
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
inconsistent
with
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
who
was
exploring
whether
or
not
what
we
have
here
is
a
--
is
a
racial
criteria,
pure
and
simple,
and
you
say,
well,
it's
general.
and
then
we
point
out
that
each
applicant
didn't
have
his
name,
but
they
had
his
or
her
race.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
--
well,
but
you
are
loading
the
--
the
equation.
the
chief
justice's
question
i
don't
think
has
been
--
been
fully
answered.
you
are
--
you
are
saying
that
you
can
eliminate
constitutional
concerns
because
the
statute
is
enacted,
which
just
repeats
those
same
constitutional
concerns.
it's
--
it's
like
having
two
tracks
on
the
audio
that
don't
quite
fit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'd
like
to
talk
just
briefly--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
would
like
to
talk
just
briefly
about
this
point
that
the
--
some
of
our
hypotheticals
where
the
test
hadn't
been
given
yet.
here
the
test
has
been
given.
and
i
had
some
concerns
along
the
line
of
justice
ginsburg's
question.
she
said,
well,
it's
not
a
vested
interest.
on
the
other
hand,
2000e-(l)(
2)
says
that
test
results
can't
be
altered.
there's
a
statutory
interpretation
question
of
whether
that
means
they
can't
be
used
altogether.
two
points
about
the
statute.
number
one,
doesn't
that
diminish
at
least
the
force
of
the
argument
that
this
is
a
vested
interest?
it
means
the
tests
are
--
have
a
--
have
a
certain
presumption
in
--
in
their
favor.
secondly,
on
--
and
maybe
this
is
a
question
for
the
--
for
the
petitioners
rather
than
you.
if
we
--
let's
assume
that
we
relied
on
that
statute
and
said
that
there's
a
title
vii
violation
here
because
the
statute
was
violated.
i
know
you
have
an
interpretational
argument
there.
would
that
give
the
petitioners
all
the
relief
they
need
here,
or
is
there
still
additional
relief
under
their
1983
cause
of
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
can't
alter
the
results.
but
let's
not
get
into
the
statutory
interpretation--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
1964,
congress
enacted
the
civil
rights
act.
title
vii
of
that
act
had
prohibited
employment
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
certain
protected
characteristics
or
trace
--
or
traits
and
of
course
these
included
race,
color,
and
natural
origin.
under
that
provision,
it
is
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
treat
a
particular
person
less
favorably
than
others
because
of
a
protected
trait.
and
this
type
of
intentional
discrimination
has
come
to
be
known
as
disparate-treatment.
in
a
leading
case
in
this
court
called
griggs
versus
duke
power
company,
it
was
established
that
title
vii
also
prohibits
in
some
cases
practices
that
are
not
intended
to
discriminate
but
in
fact
have
a
disproportionate
adverse
effect
on
minorities
and
this
is
known
as
disparate-impact.
in
1991,
congress
added
the
provision
to
title
vii
that
prohibits
disparate-impact
treatment,
in
other
words,
it
codified
what
the
supreme
court
had
held
in
griggs.
so
both
the
disparate-treatment
and
disparate-impact
provisions
are
now
in
the
statute
as
it
applies
today,
and
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case.
the
first
is
a
statutory
question.
what
is
the
rule
when
the
disparate-treatment
and
disparate-impact
provisions
appear
to
be
intention
or
in
conflict?
the
second
issue
is
a
constitutional
question
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
operates
to
forbid
the
employers'
conduct
here,
and
this
case
arose
when
the
city
of
new
haven,
connecticut
found
it
necessary
to
determine
which
of
its
firefighters
should
be
promoted
to
the
positions
of
lieutenant
and
captain.
in
the
new
haven
fire
department
as
in
emergency-service
organizations
nationwide,
firefighters
prize
their
promotion
to
and
within
officer
ranks.
and
to
make
its
promotion
determination,
the
city
administered
tests
and
the
tests
were
part
oral
and
part
written.
when
the
test
result
showed
that
the
white
candidates
had
outperformed
minority
candidates,
a
rancorous
public
debate
ensued.
some
firefighters
had
the
test
result
showed
at
the
test
themselves
were
discriminatory.
and
they
argued
that
to
certify
the
results
would
make
the
city
liable
for
violating
the
disparate-impact
provision
in
title
vii.
they
threatened
the
discrimination
lawsuit
if
the
city
made
promotions
based
on
the
test.
other
firefighters
said
the
tests
were
neutral
and
fair.
those
firefighters
threatened
suit
for
violation
of
title
vii's
disparate-treatment
provision
that
the
city
relied
on
the
statistical
racial
disparity
and
rejected
the
test
results.
in
the
end,
the
city
took
the
side
of
those
who
protested
the
test
results
and
then
threw
out
the
examinations.
seventeen
white
and
hispanic
firefighters,
who
likely
would
have
been
promoted,
based
on
their
good
test
performance,
sued
the
city
and
some
of
its
officials.
they
alleged
that
the
city
and
its
officials
violated
both
the
disparate-treatment
provisions
of
title
vii
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
firefighters
with
the
plaintiffs
below
and
because
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
against
them,
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
that
ruling,
they
become
the
petitioners
here.
we
granted
certiorari.
because
a
decision
for
the
petitioners
based
on
the
statute
would
provide
their
relief
sought,
we
consider
their
statutory
claim
before
addressing
the
constitutional
issue.
wholly
evidence
demonstrates
that
the
city
chose
not
to
certify
the
examination
results
because
of
the
statistical
disparity
based
on
race
and
so
our
bid
analysis
begins
with
this
premise.
the
city's
expressed
race-based
decision
making
would
violate
the
disparate-treatment
provision
of
title
vii
absent
some
valid
defense.
so
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
conduct
was
discriminatory
but
whether
the
city
had
a
lawful
justification
for
discriminating.
the
respondents
here,
the
city
and
those
of
its
officials
who
were
named
in
the
suit
argued
that
the
city's
decision
not
to
certify
the
test
results
was
permissible
in
order
to
avoid
creating
a
disparate-impact
and
we
consider
therefore
whether
the
purpose
to
avoid
disparate-impact
liability
excuses
what
otherwise
would
be
prohibited
disparate-treatment
discrimination.
respondents
are
joined
by
the
united
states
as
amicus
and
asserting
that
an
employer's
good
faith
belief
that
his
actions
are
necessary
to
comply
with
the
disparate-impact
provision
is
enough
to
justify
race
conscious
conduct.
but
allowing
employers
to
violate
the
disparate-treatment
prohibition
based
on
a
mere
good
faith
fear
of
disparate-impact
liability
would
encourage
race-based
action
at
the
slightest
hint
of
disparate-impact.
that
would
amount
to
a
de
facto
quota
system
and
evil
title
vii
is
expressly
designed
to
prevent.
in
resolving
the
statutory
conflict,
we
note
that
this
court
had
--
has
considered
cases
similar
to
this
one
in
the
context
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
those
cases
hold
that
certain
government
actions
to
remedy
past
racial
discrimination,
actions
that
are
themselves
based
on
race
are
constitutional
only
where
there
is
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
that
the
remedial
actions
were
necessary.
and
we
hold
today
that
the
same
standard
applies
in
the
context
of
title
vii.
before
an
employer
can
engage
in
intentional
discrimination
for
the
asserted
purpose
of
avoiding
or
remedying
an
unintentional
disparate
impact,
the
employer
must
have
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
to
believe
that
absent
to
race
conscious
discriminatory
action
it
will
be
subject
to
disparate-impact
liability.
applying
the
strong
basis
in
evidence
standards
gives
effect
to
both
the
disparate-treatment
and
disparate-impact
provisions.
the
standard
leaves
ample
room
for
employers'
voluntary
compliance
efforts
which
are
essential
to
eradicating
workplace
discrimination.
and
the
standard
appropriately
constrains
employers'
discretion
in
making
race-based
decisions.
it
limits
that
discretion.
the
cases
in
which
there
is
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
of
disparate-impact
liability
but
is
not
so
restrictive
that
it
allows
employers
to
act
only
when
there
is
approvable
actual
violation.
in
addition
resolving
the
statutory
conflict
in
this
way
allows
the
disparate-impact
prohibition
to
work
in
a
manner
that
is
consistent
with
other
provisions
of
title
vii.
one
of
those
provisions
forbids
adjusting
test
scores
on
the
basis
of
a
race.
an
employment
test
can
be
an
important
part
of
a
neutral
selection
system
that
safeguards
against
the
very
racial
animosities
that
title
vii
was
intended
to
prevent.
having
determined
that
the
proper
statutory
standard,
we
must
apply
that
standard
to
the
summary
judgment
motioned
made
by
the
petitioners
here.
the
record
makes
it
clear
that
even
if
respondents
were
motivated
as
a
subjective
matter
by
a
desire
to
avoid
committing
disparate-impact
discrimination,
there
is
no
support
for
the
conclusion
that
respondents
had
an
objective
strong
basis
in
evidence
to
fear
disparate-impact
liability.
although
there
was
racial
disparity
in
the
examination
results,
the
problem
for
the
respondents
is
that
under
title
vii,
the
city
could
be
liable
for
disparate-impact
discrimination
only.
if
the
examinations
were
not
job
related
and
consistent
with
business
necessity
or
if
there
existed
an
equally
valid
less
discriminatory
alternative
that
serve
the
city's
needs
but
that
the
city
refused
to
adopt.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
detail
in
the
opinion,
we
conclude
there's
no
strong
basis
and
evidence
to
establish
that
the
test
was
deficient
in
either
of
this
respect
and
the
opinion
discusses
these
matters
in
some
detail
including
the
careful
steps
that
the
city
took
to
ensure
that
the
examinations
were
job
related.
the
tests
were
designed
specifically
for
the
new
haven
department
by
an
outstanding
consulting
firm,
by
an
outside
consulting
firm
and
that
firm
spent
months
studying
the
lieutenant
and
captain
positions
and
designing
the
tests
in
light
of
its
findings.
the
tests
were
based
on
materials
that
were
identified
beforehand
allowing
all
candidates
an
equal
opportunity
to
prepare.
and
the
consulting
firm
took
careful
steps
to
ensure
broad
racial
participation
and
the
design
of
the
tests
and
then
their
administration.
the
process
was
open
and
fair.
after
the
tests
were
completed,
the
raw
racial
results
became
the
predominant
rational
for
the
city's
refusal
to
certify
the
results.
the
injury
in
this
case
arises
in
part
from
the
high
and
justified
expectations
of
the
candidates
who
participated
in
the
testing
process.
on
the
terms
that
the
city
had
established,
many
of
the
candidates
had
studied
for
months
with
considerable
personal
and
financial
sacrifice
and
so,
the
injury
caused
by
the
city's
reliance
on
raw
racial
statistics
at
the
end
of
the
process
was
all
the
more
severe.
there
is
no
evidence
let
alone
the
required
strong
basis
in
evidence
that
the
tests
were
flawed.
fear
of
litigation
alone
cannot
justify
an
employers'
reliance
on
race
to
the
detriment
of
individuals
who
passed
the
examinations
and
qualified
for
promotions.
the
city's
action
in
discarding
the
test
was
a
violation
of
title
vii,
summary
judgment
is
appropriate
for
petitioners
on
their
disparate-treatment
claim.
and
so
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
reversed.
in
light
of
our
statutory
ruling,
we
need
not
reach
the
question
whether
respondents'
actions
also
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
alito
