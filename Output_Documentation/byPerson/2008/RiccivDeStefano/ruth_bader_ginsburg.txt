that

to
--
to
an
affirmative
action
plan,
and
here
we're
dealing
with
this
concept
under
title

of
disparate
impact.
and
let's
take
for
one
example
a
test
that's
given
by
a
police
department,
a
fire
department,
and
it
--
it's
a
physical
fitness
test,
and
it
disproportionately
excludes
female
applicants.
and
when
the
results
come
in
and
there
are
no
women
on
the
eligibility
list,
the
department
reconsiders.
it
thinks
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
test.
it
can
probably
test
for
the
necessary
skills
in
a
way
that
will
not
achieve
those
results.
would
it
be
similarly
impermissible,
similarly
based
on
an
impermissible
criterion,
if
the
department
said:
we're
not
going
to
--
we
have
got
the
results
of
that
test.
we're
going
to
throw
it
out
and
substitute
another
that
will
not
have
those
skewed
results.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
more
women
on
the
force,
but
this
test
that
we're
giving
has
the
effect
of
excluding
most
women,
just
as
the
high
school
diploma
had
the
effect,
a
disproportionate
effect,
on
one
race.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
they
would
have
to
go
--
i
take
it
from
what
you
said
they
would
have
to
go
as
far
as
proving
a
title

case
against
themselves.
they
couldn't
do
anything
short
of
that
to
prevail
when
it
is
the
majority
race
that
is
complaining
about
discrimination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wasn't
my--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
that
can't
be
right
if
they
--
if
what
you
just
answered
to
justice
kennedy
is
--
is
right.
suppose
they
had
very
strong
evidence
that
the
test
that
they
had
given
that
had
these
results,
just
as
my
physical
fitness
test
that
excluded
all
women
--
that
had
it
those
results,
it
wasn't
job-related,
and
there
was
a
better
test
available,
they
wouldn't
have
any
vested
right
in
getting
the
promotions
under
those
circumstances,
would
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
did
they
have
the
testimony
before
the
civil
service
board,
about
--
somebody
from
another
testing
company
said
this
is
a
multiple
choice
test;
it
tests
rote
memory;
we
could
have
come
up
with
a
test
that
would
better
test
the
skills
needed
to
be
--
nothing
about
the
localization,
but
something
about
command
presence.
there
was
a
term
used,
assessment
centers;
that
this
test
didn't
effectively
test
the
skills
that
you
needed
on
the
job,
and
others
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
the
whole
idea
of
disparate
impact
is
it's
unintentional,
that's
the
assumption,
disparate
treatment,
intentional
discrimination,
disparate

unintentional,
but
it
has
askewed
racial

justice
ruth
bader

how
do
we
know
whether
something
is
discriminatory
or
just
that
it
will
have
a
certain
effect?
because
it's
in

of.
for
example,
the
greek
standard,
the
employer
wants
everybody
to
have
a
high
school
diploma,
he
wants
an
upgraded
working
staff,
was
told
by
this
court
you
can't
do
that
because
you
would
disproportionately
exclude
one
race.
justice

how
does
that--
justice

--i
know
you
said
that
in
your

when
you

so
how
does
one
determine
whether
the
concern
that
the

what

justice

when

when

you

in
which
the
legacy
of
racial

casts
an
especially
long
shadow.
in
extending
title

in

congress
singled
out
police
and
fire
departments
for
their
pervasive
exclusion

minorities.

was
no
exception.
in
the
early
1970s,
the
african-americans
and
hispanics
composed
nearly
one-third
of
the
city's
population,
but
only
3.6%
of
its
firefighters,
just
one
of
the
city's
107
fire
officers
was
black.
following
litigation,

efforts
to
increase
minority
representation
in

fire
department

success.

as
of
2003,
only
one
of

21
fire

was
african-american.
these
dark

2003

properly

the
backdrop
of
this
historical
and
