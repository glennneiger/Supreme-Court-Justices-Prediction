justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
--
but
the
--
the
problem
that
i
am
having
at
the
moment
is
that
they
did
--
from
your
point
of
view,
is
that
they
--
the
other
side
listed
28
cases
in
which
they
said
the
oregon
courts
have
followed
this
rule
of
the
instruction
has
to
be
good
as
a
whole.
now,
i
have
looked
up
those
28
cases,
and
they
do
--
they
do
say
that.
they
do
say
it,
or
they
imply
it,
or
they
apply
it.
they
are
not
completely
on
point,
but
they
are
not
completely
out
of
point,
either.
and
--
and
so
i
suppose
what
happened
is
that
the
judge
there
just
looked
at
this
instruction
on
32a.
it
looks
like
sort
of
it's
all
together.
it
really
does
look
like
it's
all
together,
the
(1)
and
the
(2).
and
he
ran
his
eye
down
the
page
and
he
said,
well,
here
are
two
other
ways
in
which
it's
no
good,
and
so
that's
the
end
of
it.
you
can't
raise
your
objection.
maybe
you
should
have
had
four
instructions
instead
of
one,
but
you
did
just
have
one.
and
under
oregon
law,
unless
every
part
of
it
is
right,
the
judge
is
correct
in
not
giving
it,
even
if
he
never
mentions
the
other
part.
and
that
28
--
it
does
seem
as
if
that's
what
those
28
cases
do
say.
so
what
do
we
say
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean
--
please,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
appear
skeptical,
but
i
am.
and
--
and
that's
because
i
have
looked
up
in
some
of
those
cases,
and
then
i
sort
of
looked
at
the
--
which
doesn't
--
most
of
them
don't
give
you
the
instructions,
so
it's
a
little
hard
to
say.
but
then
i
looked
on
page
32a
of
this
appendix
and
looked
at
what
your
instructions
looked
like.
and
--
and
if
i
were
sitting
there
as
a
judge,
i
would
think,
well,
gee,
that
looks
like
a
single
thing
there.
they
have
it
indented,
and
they
have
a
(1)
and
a
(2),
and
it
just
looks
like
it's
one
ball
of
wax.
so
can
i
really
fault
this
oregon
court
for
just
doing
what
i
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
have
some
other
handbook
that
says
beware
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
you
are
going
to
run
into
this
rule
that
says
if
there's
any
part
of
a
single
instruction
that
is
wrong,
goodbye,
even
if
the
trial
judge
never
mentioned
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it
would
be
pretty
odd.
did
the
person
who
wrote
that
read
these
28
cases
or
some
share
thereof?
and
if
you
were
going
to
do
that
--
it
wasn't
you,
i
know
--
why
--
why
wouldn't
you
just,
if
you
have
one
instruction,
copy
the
--
the
model
instruction?
then
you
won't
make
errors
in
the
other
parts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
true,
but
you
could
add
that
to
the
pattern.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
speaking
of
this
from
the
point
of
view
--
i
mean
i
--
when
i
read
that
petition
for
cert,
i
thought
this
is
a
run-around,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
think
that
now.
that
is,
in
the
--
the
reason
is
because
i
put
myself
in
the
position
of
not
the
trial
judge.
the
person
to
put
yourself
in
the
position
of
is
the
oregon
supreme
court
justice.
and
what
he
is
doing
is
he's
reading
that
instruction.
and
--
and
what
can
you
say
in
response
to
what
--
what
he
might
have
thought?
he
knows
this
rule.
the
rule
is
if
an
instruction
is
--
is
unfavorable
in
any
part,
if
it's
wrong,
you
are
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
knows
that
rule,
because
there
have
been
a
lot
of
cases
on
it.
and
then
he
reads
your
instruction,
and
as
i
looked
carefully
--
i
didn't
know
this
the
first
time
when
it
was
here,
but
he
said
because
it's
right
in
paragraph
1
--
i
mean,
it's
wrong
in
paragraph
1,
where
he
was
wrong
--
i
don't
have
to
go
to
the
rest
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
we
send
it
back,
so
he
says:
okay,
now
i've
got
to
go
to
the
rest
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
best
you
have
come
up
with
--
and
i
think
you
have
researched
this
pretty
thoroughly
--
and
the
best
you
have
come
up
with
to
find
a
case
where
they
didn't
apply
the
rule
is
that
george
case,
right?
"george",
i
think,
is
the
name
of
it.
and
there,
there
is
an
alternative
ground
which
is
that
the
judge
had
to
--
had
to
give
the
instruction
himself,
and
it's
a
criminal
case.
and
we
shepardized
it,
and
it
has
only
been
cited
twice.
and
--
and
so
i'm
slightly
at
sea,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
and
--
and
what
is
the
standard
i'm
supposed
to
use
to
decide
whether
that
state
ground
is
adequate
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
state
interest
in
the
rule
in
general,
i
take
it,
is
to
require
the
lawyers,
if
they
are
going
to
object
to
the
instructions
that
the
judge
is
going
to
give,
to
produce
an
instruction
that
is
a
correct
instruction
of
the
law.
that's
--
that's
why,
i
guess,
they
have
this
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
you'd
better
get
it
right,
because
if
you
don't
get
it
right,
you're
going
to
lose
your
ability
to
claim
that
the
judge
was
wrong
in
refusing
to
give
any
part
of
it.
now,
if
that's
the
reason
they
have
that
rule,
that
would
seem
to
apply
as
much
in
this
case
as
in
any
other
case.
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
say
the
28
cases
are
not
quite
as
clear
as
i
suggested.
that
is,
i
couldn't
find
in
those
28
cases
really
a
comparable
situation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
each
instance
it
seemed
as
if
one
of
two
things
was
the
case:
either
(a)
where
the
instruction
was
in
error,
it
really
was
the
matter
brought
up
in
the
first
place,
or
the
court
said,
but
he
gave
the
essence
of
the
instruction
he
wanted
anyway.
now,
which
of
those
cases
do
you
think
--
i
am
leading
up
to,
what
of
--
what
of
those
cases
do
you
think
is
your
best
support,
because
i
couldn't
--
they
are
not
perfect.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
--
what
you
can't
tell
from
that
is
what
was
the
part
of
the
sympathy
instruction
that
they
thought
was
wrong,
and
was
the
part
that
they
thought
was
wrong
really
part
and
parcel
of
the
part
that
the
--
that
the
appellant
was
complaining
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that's
another
--
i
remember
that,
because
they
said
on
that
one
--
some
floor
covering
thing,
wasn't
it,
that
they
had
some
liability
for
bad
floors
or
designing
the
floors
wrong--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
that's
the
case,
what
they
said
was:
don't
worry
about
it
because
basically
he
did
give
the
instruction
that
you
wanted,
though
in
a
different
way--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
besides
that,
they
added--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
i
know
you're
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
the
last
one,
what
i
have
here
is
that
the
court
said
the
so-called
requested
instruction
was
never
requested
at
all--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
--
i
will
go
look
at
that
again.
but
what
is
the
standard?
i
mean,
remember,
what
i
think
your
brother
said
at
the
end
is
correct.
imagine
that
yours
is
a
death
case,
and
we
have
said
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
this
execution
is
unconstitutional,
and
then
we
send
it
back.
and
the
court
then
says:
oh,
we
forgot;
there
are
a
couple
of
matters
of
state
law
here
that
bar
the
federal
consideration
of
the
death
question.
and
here
they
are.
and
then
they
come
up
with
just
this.
is
this
--
is
this
a
situation
where
you
would
be
equally
--
that's
my
problem.
and
so,
put
yourself
in
my
shoes
and
--
and
tell
me
what
you
would
do
if
this
is
a
death
case
and
not
the
case
that
you
have?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
imagining
that
what
has
happened
is
that
the
instruction
that
they
have
given
for
the
defendant
in
the
death
case
violates
federal
law,
and
then
we
send
it
back,
and
what
happens
is
that
the
state
court
says,
oh,
it
may
violate
federal
law
all
right,
but
it's
--
the
federal
court
is
blocked
from
considering
it
because
there
are
these
two
other
state
grounds
that
mean
that
the
lawyer--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
what
are
the
elements?
imagine
--
i'm
trying
to
get
help,
if
i
were
to
try
to
put
pen
to
paper
on
this.
suppose
they
win
in
this.
then
we'll
be
back
at
the
state
law
issue
that
i
thought
was
going
to
be
there,
which
was
the
issue
of
--
you
are
talking
about
the
colloquy.
did
they
give
the
essence
of
the
federal
mandated
instruction,
or
didn't
they?
and
then
look
how
cooperative
the
judge
was,
et
cetera.
but
that
isn't
before
us
now.
what's
before
us
now
is
something
that
blocks
our
consideration
of
that
or
anybody's
consideration
of
that.
and
imagine
this
is
not
your
case;
imagine
it
is
the
most,
you
know,
striking
case,
that's
why
i
used
a
death
example,
and
we
go
through
exactly
the
same
thing.
and
then
the
court
does
exactly
the
same
thing,
the
state
court,
that
happened
here.
and
now
what
are
the
words
that
distinguish
whether
the
court
is
in
essence,
to
be
colloquial,
giving
everybody
the
runaround
or
whether
the
court
is
applying
a
--
an
absolute,
clear,
you
know,
fair,
standard
of
state
law?
which
really
they
should
have
gone
into
first
and
saved
everybody
a
lot
of
trouble.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
they
say
is
--
look
at
the
two
errors
they
found.
one
is
in
saying
"may"
instead
of
"shall",
and
the
other
is
in
saying
"illicit
profit"
instead
of
"profit".
and
they
are
pretty
picky.
so,
this
is
--
this
is
very
picky,
they
say.
and
not
only
are
they
being
picky,
but
they
are
being
picky
after
the
event.
and
they
could
have
raised
it
first,
and
they
have
28
cases
supporting
them,
but
none
of
these
cases
is
right
on
point
because
the
subject
matter
is,
you
know,
closer,
bound
up.
and
so
they
put
all
this
together
and
say
it's
an
unreasonable
application
of
a
rule
that
was
there.
and
you
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--sorenson
was
the
agent
and
the
principal,
the
broker
who
was
selling
some
land.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
think
in
that
case
they
also
said:
by
the
way,
you've
got
basically
the
instruction
that
you
wanted,
and
you
overlooked
--
no,
that
was
the
case
where
they
said:
you
overlooked
in
your
instruction
an
important
allegation
of
fact,
which
allegation
was
that
the
guy
had
been
rehired
as
a
broker.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
didn't
say
it
was
in
error.
i
mean,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
--
what
is
your
response
to
the
chief
justice's
suggestion
that
maybe
we
should
reach
the
issue
of
due
process
on
the
amount?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i'll
tell
you
my
subjective
reaction
going
through
these
38
cases
is
they
are
not
quite
in
point,
but
i
really
take
away
the
idea
of
the
bad
faith,
particularly
because
the
first
time
what
the
judge
said,
which
i
didn't
understand
its
significance
then,
was
the
judge
said:
well,
since
the
first
part
of
that
paragraph
(1)
was
in
--
was
in
error
anyway,
i
don't
have
to
reach
the
questions
of
whether
there
were
other
mistakes
under
state
law
in
the
rest
of
the
instruction.
they
did
say
that
the
first
time,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
case
07-1216,
philip
morris
usa
versus
williams,
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
