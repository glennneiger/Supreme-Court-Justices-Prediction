justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
state
court
hadn't
ruled
on
it
at
that
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
how
do
we
rule
on
it
as
a
matter
of
first
impression?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
ask
you
about
that.
that's
a
thrust
of
your
argument:
it
would
have
been
futile
to
comply
with
the
specific
--
drafting
a
perfect
--
perfect
instruction
"correct
in
all
respects".
but
i
have
to
think
the
trial
--
the
record
is
subject
to
the
reading
that
the
trial
judge
thought
the
issue
had
already
been
adequately
taken
care
of,
rather
than
it
would
be
an
incorrect
instruction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
in
the
record
is
the
portion
of
the
colloquy
about
the
instructions
most
clearly
stated
in
your
view,
on
your
side
of
that
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
exactly
the
point
i
make.
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
was
saying,
i
think
it's
already
covered,
which
is
very
different
from
saying,
no
matter
how
you
phrase
it,
i
won't
give
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
a
basis
for
questioning
the
good
faith
of
the
court
in
that
case,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
don't
think
that's
true
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
just
tell
me,
well,
why
was
it
an
exercise
in
futility?
that's
what
i
don't
quite
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
she
said
she
thought
it
was
already
covered.
that's
what
i
--
on
that
very
page
you
pointed
me
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
