mr.
robert
s.
peck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
constitutional
mandate
in
this
case
is
conditioned
in
several
significant
respects,
and
it
invites
the
discretion
and
judgment
of
a
state
court
that's
applying
it.
first
of
all,
it
says
that
states
have
flexibility
in
coming
up
with
a
procedure
to
address
this
procedural
due
process
issue.
it
also
says
that
it
has
to
be
an
appropriate
case;
there
has
to
be
a
significant
risk
of
juror
confusion,
and
a
request.
there's
no
indication
in
the
opinion
that
this
court
intended
to
federalize
the
state
procedure
over
how
that
request
occurs.
it--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--i
do
not,
but
i
also
submit
that
it
is
more
than
adequate.
exist
--
what
the
oregon
supreme
court
decided
was
that
the
existing
procedure
permitting
a
limiting
instruction
to
be
requested
--
in
oregon
it's
rule
105,
the
same
language
as
in
the
federal
rule
--
and
such
a
request
has
to
be
timely,
it
has
to
be
specific,
it
has
to
be
on
the
record.
and
oregon
precedent
says
that
when
we
mean
specific,
the
proponent
has
to
give
us
the
exact
language
--
this
is
part
of
the
party
presentation
principle
--
the
exact
language
that
they
are
asking
us
to
use.
and
that
means
that
we
also
apply
our
traditional
92-year-old
rule
that
requests
for
instruction
must
be
clear
and
correct
in
all
respects.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
well--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--i
would
look
first
at
reyes-camarena,
which
is
a
2000
--
a
2000
decision
involving
the
death
penalty.
and
there,
there
were
two
parts
of
this
request,
in
a
single
request.
the
request
asked
for
a
mitigating
factors
instruction,
which
the
court
found
was
correct
on
the
law
and
--
and
would
have
been
given
had
it
been
asked
for
separately.
but
it
also
asked
the
jury
to
consider
sympathy
for
the
defendant,
which
they
found
to
be
contrary
to
oregon
law,
and
therefore,
it
was
not
error
for
the
trial
court
to
have
refused
this.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
well,
the
court,
though,
did
cite
a
prior
decision
that
talked
about
a
sympathy
instruction
and
claimed
that
this
one
was
no
different
than
that.
it
was
contained
in
a
single
instruction.
it
makes
clear,
the
opinion
does,
on
that.
owings
v.
rose
is
that
another
case
which
both
parties
have
cited.
and
in
owings,
it's
very
clear.
there
you
have
two
different
parts
of
an
instruction
that
are
offered
at
the
same
time,
and
--
and
one
part
is
right.
and
this
--
this
one
deals
with
third-party
liability.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
if--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--but--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--and
besides
that--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--this
was
an
alternate
ground.
then
in
hotelling
v.
walther,
a
1944
case,
the
proposed
instruction
consisted
of
three
separate
sentences,
and
the
court
does
reprint
that
instruction.
and
each
of
those
sentences
had
a
different
legal
proposition
in
it.
and
it
was
only
the
last
sentence,
the
third
proposition,
that
the
court
found
to
be
in
error
and,
therefore,
found
that
there
was
no
error
in
failing
to
give
this
instruction
because
it
was
not
clear
and
correct
in
all
respects.
i
--
i
think
that
that
is--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--but--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--but
i
do
not
believe
that
that
was
the
ground--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--well,
you
know,
it's
--
it's
hard
to
get
my
arms
around
your
hypothetical,
because
i
don't
know
the
grounds
on
which--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--i
understand.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
but
--
but
the
question
would
be
then,
why
would
that
be
a
situation
like
this,
where
the
trial
judge
--
contrary
to
your
assumption,
justice
ginsburg
--
the
trial
judge
did
find
that
there
were
other
parts
of
the
instruction
offered
by
philip
morris
that
were
incorrect
on
the
law,
and
the
illicit
profits
was
one
of
them.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
justice--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--this
is
--
this
is
a
process.
counsel
in
the
case
in
a
trial
in
oregon
can
offer
an
instruction
--
a
proffered
instruction
up
to
the
point
when
the
jury
is
instructed
under
their
law.
so
philip
morris
had
the
opportunity
to
correct
it.
the
practical
nature
of
a
charge
conference
is
that
the
parties
come
in
with
their
proposed
instructions.
the
plaintiffs
followed
the
pattern
instruction,
which
by
the
way
does
not
require
enumeration.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
the
--
it's
not
a
rule
of
trial
procedure.
it's
a
rule
of
appellate
review.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
believe
there's
--
there's
--
first
of
all,
the
trial
judge
rejected
this
instruction
on
multiple
grounds
and
made
it
clear
that
she
--
the
illicit
profits
request
was
contrary
to
the
oregon
statute
that
sets
up
the
criteria.
she
found
other
parts
confusing
and
contradictory.
but
--
and
--
but
there
are
two
things
that
i
think
are
significant
here.
you
have
to
look
at
what
was
discussed
here.
the
trial
judge,
if
you
turn
to
21a
of
the
joint
appendix:
"we
are
not
here
to
punish
for
other
plaintiffs'
harms.
"
"we
are
here
to
punish,
if
we
are
here
to
punish
at
all,
for
the
conduct
that
caused
harm
to
jesse
williams
on
or
after
september
1,
1988.
"
this
sounds
very
much
like
an
acceptance
of
the
rule
that
philip
morris
was
advocating.
on
19a,
she
said:
"these
punitive
damages
are
not
designed
to
compensate
for
other
plaintiffs
who
are
not
here.
"
on
20a,
there
is
a
colloquy;
she
expresses
her
belief
that
the
risk
is
adequately
guarded
against,
suggests
language
to
express
that,
and
asks:
"does
that
get
you
where
you
need
to
be?
"
that's
when
philip
morris's
counsel
says
"okay".
she
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
she
had
satisfied
it.
she
then
follows
up.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
understand.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
well,
here's
the
reason
why
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
record
and
--
and
this
litigant,
it
is
not
significant.
and
that
is,
if
you
look
at
21a,
the
appendix
in
our
--
our
merit
brief,
there
we
have
philip
morris
in
another
smoker
trial
in
oregon
offering
up
a
requested
instruction
on
this
issue.
this
is
in
2002,
so
it's
well
before
this
court's
decision
in
this
case.
it's
even
before
state
farm
v.
campbell,
and
the
requested
instruction
says,
one
sentence:
"you
are
not
to
impose
punishment
for
harms
suffered
by
persons
other
than
the
plaintiff
before
you.
"
mr.
robert
s.
peck
but
she
--
but
that's
actually
not
the
same
issue
that
she
asked
that
on.
counsel
cited
page
17a
of
the
joint
appendix
for
that
question.
and
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
of
16a,
her
question
is:
"let
me
stop
first
and
go
back
to
the
proportionality
point
you
are
making.
"
this
is
the
ratio
point,
the
second
guidepost
of
bmw
v.
gore.
she
says:
"is
there
case
law
that
says
the
trial
court
shall,
in
order
to
have
a
constitutional
instruction,
tell
the
jury
about
proportionality?
"
and
this
is
where
he
says:
it's
addressed
post-verdict.
she
asks:
is
there
any
case
law;
and
she
says:
no,
i'm
not
going
to
go
there.
i'm
not
going
to
go
where
no
judge
has
gone
before
--
because
she
did
not
want
to
be
reversed.
so
she
is
trying
to
be
careful,
and
i
think
you
have
to
credit
the
oregon--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--no.
i
--
i
think
that
what
she
said
is
as
to
the
proportionality
issue.
on
the
other
issue,
she
even
returns
to
it
later
when
philip
morris
brings
up
a
different
issue
with
respect
to
punitive
damages.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
no.
i'm
saying
that
she
thought
she
was
complying
with
that.
she
stated
on
the
record
that
we
are
not
here
to
punish
for
other
plaintiffs'
harms.
later
on
that
other
issue,
if
you
look
at
28a--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--she
seemed
to
accept--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--she
accepted
the
point
before
you
announced
the
rule,
and
the
oregon
court
of
appeals,
ruling
in
the
estate
of
schwarz
case
where
they
offered
that
one-sentence
instruction,
reversed
the
verdict
in
part
because
that
instruction,
they
said,
should
have
been
given.
so
they
anticipated
this
court's
rule.
i
think--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--well,
in
fact,
the
--
the
court
thought
it
was
relying
on
it.
in
each
of
the
previous
iterations
in
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
oregon
supreme
court,
they
cited
this
rule,
"clear
and
correct
in
all
respects.
"
in
order
to
reject
the
"harm
to
others"
instruction
because
they
said
it
was
inconsistent
with
state
law.
this
point--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
they
went
further
then,
and
this
is
what
gave
this
court
the
authority
to
rule
on
that
substantive
issue.
they
said
that
that
request
was
inconsistent
with
the
oregon
statute.
and
they
did
so
on
page
48a
of
the
petition,
where
they
say:
"in
williams
i,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
instruction
was
incorrect
under
state
law.
"
"we
agree.
"
and
then
again
on
page
52a,
they
note
that:
"that
is
not
correct
as
an
independent
matter
of
oregon
law
respecting
the
conduct
of
jury
trials
and
instructions--
"
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--but--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--but
then
they
went
on
to
say:
"and
nothing
in
due
process
requires
us
to
look
at
this
differently.
"
that's
where
they
made
their
error.
that
was
the
constitutional
mistake
that
the
oregon
court
made.
they
thought
they
were
wrong
on
a
state
ground.
they
thought
there
was
no
federal
issue
addressing
that,
and
so
they
decided
that
they
didn't
have
to
reach
any
other
state
law
issues.
and
they
ignored
the
well-preserved
objections
that
mrs.
williams
made
to
the
other
parts
of
this
unified
instruction
on
punitive
damages.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
what
was
not
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
was
their
decision
that
the
oregon
statute
which
permits
you
to
punish
a
misconduct
in
order
to
deter
others
from
doing
that
allowed
punishment
for
harm
to
nonparties.
that
part
was
their
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
if
there
were
no
due
process
equation
here,
that
would
have
been
an
independent
state
ground.
it
was
wrong
as
a
matter
of
due
process.
but
there
are
other
grounds,
other
mistakes,
substantive
mistakes,
of
oregon
law
in
this
instruction.
and
any
trial
court
that
gave
instruction
number
34,
which
was
objected
to
as
a
whole,
would
have
committed
reversible
error
because
they
failed
to
follow
the
oregon
statute.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
think
it
was
natural
for
the
court
to
do
that.
that
was
the
issue
presented
to
them
by
philip
morris.
and
courts
do
not
reach
out
to
do
other
issues.
they
reach
--
they
were
being
solicitous
of
philip
morris,
and
they
were
addressing
the
arguments
that
philip
morris
made.
and
when
they
decided
that
that
inured
to
mrs.
williams'
benefit,
not
to
philip
morris's
benefit,
then
they
said
we
don't
need
to
address
your
other
questions.
and
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
oregon
supreme
court
as
noting
in
their
own
decision
that
there
was
no
futility
here.
in
fact,
the
last
time
we
were
here
philip
morris
said
the
reason
they
needed
this
instruction
was
because
of
what
was
said
at
closing
argument.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
think
the
easiest
way
to
look
at
this--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--is
imagine
that
the
statute
of
limitations,
which
now
bars
any
such
suit
in
oregon,
were
brought
today,
after
this
court's
decision
in
williams,
and
imagine
that
philip
morris
is
the
defendant,
and
at
the
end
of
the
trial
they
offer
their
number
34
as
it
was
before
saying,
"this
court
said
that
they
had
made
the
right
choice
in
asking
for
this
instruction.
"
a
trial
court
clearly
would
engage
in
reversible
error
if
they
gave
that
instruction
because
it
materially
departs
from
oregon
law.
at
the
same
time,
they
could
deny
that
instruction.
they
could
deny
that
instruction,
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
would
not
violate
the
mandate
of
this
court's
decision
by
saying
that
that
is
a
correct
decision
on
the
part
of
the
trial
law
court
because
it
was
not
clear
and
correct
in
all
respects.
and
that
is
part
of
what
distinguishes
this.
this
is
still
a
rule
that
has
to
apply
to
its
instruction--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--i
would
urge
you,
justice
breyer,
to
look
at
the
original
case
in
1916,
the
sorenson
case.
there
the
court
was
faced
with
the
question:
if
there
is
the
kernel
of
a
correct
instruction
in
there,
is
that
adequate
to
ask
the
court
to
give
that
instruction
or
should
we
insist
on
what
they
thought
at
the
time
was
the
majority
rule
in
the
united
states,
that
we
should
insist
on
an
instruction
that
is
clear
and
correct
in
all
respects,
and
that
the
--
that
the
counsel
has
the
responsibility
to
provide
that?
and
they
decided
to
go
with
the
clear
and
correct
rule.
that
was
the
debate
that
they
had,
and
that
debate
informs
this
one.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
right.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
and
there's
a
similar
distinction
that
makes
osborne
irrelevant,
which
counsel
suggested
was
a
--
an
exemplar
here.
in
osborne,
an
element
of
the
crime
had
not
been
instructed
upon.
that's
why
there
didn't
have
to
be
the
offer
of
an
instruction.
but
the
party
presentation
principle
puts
the
onus
on
counsel
to
do
so,
and
philip
morris
showed,
in
2002,
well
before
this
court's
decisions
that
they
know
how
to
do
it
when
they
want
to.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
and
i
--
i
contend,
your
honor,
that
the--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--well,
i
think--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--i
think
the
oregon
supreme
court
read
that
decision--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--well,
i'm
prepared
to
say
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
took
that
remand
order
to
mean
that
they
had
to
have
in
place
--
this
was
a
procedural
due
process
decision
--
that
they
had
to
have
a
procedure
that
was
fair,
outcome
neutral,
applied--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--well,
if
you
look--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--when
considering--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--your
honor--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--no,
it
was
not
wrong.
i
don't
think
it
was
wrong,
and
here's
the
reason
why
i
don't
think
it
was
wrong:
you
corrected
the
oregon
supreme
court
when
they
thought
that
due
process
does
not
inform
the
analysis
on
harm
to
nonparties.
you
corrected
that
substantive
error,
and
that
part
is
what
they
got
wrong.
much
of
this
opinion
said
that
they
got
lots
of
other
things
right.
and
so
oregon
looked
at
it
and
said,
"okay,
we
got
that
issue
wrong,
but
there
are
other
problems
with
this
instruction
that
are
adequate
and
independent
grounds
for--
"
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--you
did
not
remand
for
that,
but
when
this
court
decides
a
constitutional
issue
of
one
part,
it
doesn't
necessarily
tell
the
court
anything
different.
what
--
the
essence
of
this
court's
opinion
is
that
where
there's
a
significant
risk
of
jury
confusion,
the
state
has
to
provide
a
procedure
and
has
flexibility
in
designing
that
procedure.
there
is
no
indication
that
the
procedure
for
limiting
instructions
does
not
satisfy
that.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
believe
there
is.
and
i
believe
that
it
would
be
error
to
suggest
to
the
state
supreme
court
that
they
must,
even
though
prudent,
follow
a
specific
sequence,
simply
because
that
would
mean
that
they
would
have
to
necessarily
decide
every
state
law
issue
in
the
case--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--yes.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
understand
that,
but
i
think
the
adequate
and
independent
state
law
ground
provides
all
the
protection.
you
assume,
and
i
think
properly
so,
that
state
supreme
courts
will
operate
in
good
faith.
even
in
flowers,
after
the
fourth
trip
to
the
u.s.
supreme
court,
were
--
alabama
supreme
court
was
still
trusted
to
apply
the
decision.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
except--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--well,
by
--
by
accepting
that
if
the
rule
that
has
been
imposed
was
invoked
properly
by
the
party
that
invoked
it
at
the
right
time--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--that
it
is
firmly
established
and
regularly
followed,
then
it
should
satisfy
the
court--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--i
suggest
that
it
would
be
different.
i
think
the
oregon
supreme
court
decided,
when
they
decided
that
there
was
no
futility
in
offering
another
one,
that
it
would
be
different.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--but
--
but
--
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
if
after
closing
arguments,
which
was
the
trigger
that
philip
morris
urged
upon
this
court
for
needing
this
substantive
rule,
if
that
--
if
after
that
philip
morris's
counsel
had
returned
to
the
judge
--
you
know,
they
said
a
few
things
that
we
think
would
tell
the
jury
to
punish
for
harm
to
others.
we
don't
think
the
instruction
is
adequate.
we
will
give
you
the
same
instruction,
that
one-sentence
instruction
like
we
gave
in
estate
of
schwarz.
i
believe
the
court
would
have
given
it.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
well,
your
honor,
of
course,
the
last
time
we
were
here
you
had
a
full
briefing
and
even
some
argument
on
that.
and
i
--
i
believe
that
we
are
prepared
to
stand
on
that
briefing
and
argument.
we
do
not
believe
the
due
process
clause
is
an
exercise
in
elementary
school
mathematics.
it
does
not
tell
you
something
about
this.
here
you
have
to
look
at
the
enormity
of
the
misconduct.
and
that
dictates--
mr.
robert
s.
peck
--i
understand.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
well,
it's
--
it's
certainly
within
this
court's
power
to
do
that.
philip
morris
has
made
a
very
harsh
accusation
in
this
case
of
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
oregon
supreme
court.
there
was
no
sandbagging
here.
the
oregon
court
did
not
act
in
bad
faith.
mrs.
williams
raised
these
state-law
issues
at
every
opportunity,
which
is
something
that
philip
morris
denied
in
their
petition
but
then
conceded
in
their
merit
brief.
and
the
fact
is
it
was
before
the
oregon
court
of
appeals.
it
was
before
the
oregon
supreme
court.
we
even
raised
it
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
--
i
am
not
suggesting
that
you
decide
the
question,
but
i
recognize
the
court
has
the
power
to
do
so.
mapp
v.
ohio
came
to
this
court
as
a
first
amendment
case
and
came
out
as
a
fourth
amendment
case.
mr.
robert
s.
peck
i
believe
we
had
full
and
adequate
briefing.
we
may
not
have
had
the
opportunity
to
fully
argue
the
case,
and
it's
for
you
to
decide
whether
or
not
you
--
you
have
enough
on
that.
i
thank
you.
