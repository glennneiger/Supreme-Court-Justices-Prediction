mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
today
because
the
oregon
court
failed
to
follow
this
court's
directions
on
remand
and
because
the
ground
it
gave
is
not
adequate
to
show
a
forfeiture
of
due
process
rights.
this
--
this
court
vacated
after
finding
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
applied
the
wrong
constitutional
standard,
and
it
remanded
with
directions
to
apply
the
standard
that
the
court
laid
out.
but
the
oregon
court
didn't
do
that.
it
never
even
addressed
the
constitutional
issue.
the
oregon
court,
of
course,
refused
to
follow
this
court's
direction
because
it
believed
there
were
mistakes
in
another
paragraph
in
our
instruction
request
dealing
with
what
the
court
referred
to
as
"unrelated
issues".
but
that
isn't
what
this
court
mandated.
and
the
specific
forfeiture
theory
adopted
here
for
the
first
time
after
nine
years
of
appellate
litigation
is
completely
inadequate
to
avoid
this
mandate.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
this
disposition
is
quite
inconsistent
with
what
the
court
mandated.
the
court
heard
arguments
in
this
case
about
the
"correct
in
all
respects"
rule,
but
it
still
mandated
an
application
of
the
constitutional
standard,
including
the
prohibition
on
punishment
for
harm
to
nonparties,
and
that
standard
simply
was
never
applied.
we
say
that's
inconsistent
with
this
court's
opinion.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
we
don't
say
that
the
court
can
never
adopt
a
state
law
standard
after
remand
from
this
court,
but
we
say
that
this
disposition
is
inconsistent
with--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
because
the
preservation
issue
was
debated
before
this
court,
and
it
adopted
a
specific
order
here
saying
on
remand
now
consider
the
constitutional
standard,
which
is
the
prohibition
on--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
your
honor,
this
is
very
similar
to
what
occurred
in
the
sullivan
case
in
this
court,
where
the
issue
of
preservation
was
debated
before
this
court
at
the
cert
stage
in
the
cert
papers,
and
the
court
said:
we
sub
silentio
passed
on
the
adequacy
of
the
state
ground
when
we
gvr'ed
the
case.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
that
takes
us
to
our
second
and
principal
argument,
which
is
that
that
ground
would
not
be
adequate
under
this
court's
criteria
for
adequacy.
and
we
say
that
--
that
there
are
really
three
reasons
why
that
would
not
be
an
adequate
ground
for
forfeiting
this
valuable
constitutional
right.
it's
an
ambush.
it
was
a
surprise
ruling
that
we
couldn't
anticipate.
it's
an
exercise
in
futility
because,
even
if
we
submitted
a
perfect
instruction
that
complied
with
that
rule,
we
would
have
been
rejected
anyway
by
the
trial
court
that
simply
believed
that
this
instruction
wasn't
required
by
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
no.
the
oregon
supreme--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--your
honor,
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
adequacy
is
a
federal
law
question
for
this
court
to
decide.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
there
are
two
reasons.
first
under
the
adequacy
decisions
of
this
court,
including
lee
v.
kemna,
if
it
takes
years
and
years
after
the
trial
to
articulate
a
forfeiture
rule
like
this,
that
counts
heavily
against
the
adequacy
of
the
state
ground.
this
court
held
that
in
lee
v.
kemna
very
recently.
and
then
secondly,
this
is
a
point
that
was
argued
to
this
court
four
--
three
--
four
separate
times
now,
and
when
the
court
remanded
with
explicit
directions
to
apply
the
constitutional
standard,
that's
something
that
had
to
be
done
on
remand.
the
court
did
not
invite
the
lower
court
to
get
into
the
question
of
whether
this
request
was
made.
the
court
found
that
the
request
was
made.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
there
is
a
good
reason,
because
this
is
--
adequacy
is
ultimately
a
federal
question
for
this
court
to
decide.
the
issue
was
debated
here
four
separate
times
at
great
length.
the
court
remanded
for
a
specific
decision
by
the
lower
court.
that
wasn't
done.
and
if
we
turn
to
the
adequacy
doctrine--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--whether
or
not
there
was
an
adequate
state
ground
because
of
the
"correct
in
all
respects"
rule.
that
was
debated
in
the
merits
brief,
in
the
cert
oppositions
twice.
it
was
debated
again
in
the
cert
opposition
this
time
around.
but
the
court
has
never
accepted
it.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
because,
your
honor,
the
court
considered
--
just
as
it
did
in
sullivan,
it
considered
these
issues
in
the
cert
papers
and
then
remanded
the
case
for
a
different
issue
to
be
decided
by
the
lower
court.
but
we
don't
hesitate
from
debating
the
adequacy
issue.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no.
what
the
court
said
in
sullivan
was
that
it
was
a
sub
silentio
determination.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
because
the
parties
debated
this
extensively
in
their
briefs,
just
as
they
did
in
sullivan.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
that's
true.
this
--
this,
as
the
court
expressed
it,
was
a
slight
extension
of
the
previous
decisions.
but
your
honor,
if
the
court
feels
that
this
adequacy
issue
hasn't
been
dealt
with
previously
by
this
court,
it's
presented
squarely
here.
it
is
a
federal
question,
which
this
court
says
has
to
be
decided
by
this
court.
and
we
don't
hesitate
from--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
your
honor,
if
--
if
we're
not
right
about
the
decision
resolving
the
adequacy
issue
already,
we're
happy
to
turn
to
it
now
and
address
it
as
we
do
in
our
briefs.
this
is
not
an
adequate
state
ground
under
this
court's
decisions.
the
first
reason
for
that
is
that
this
is
a
futile
gesture
that
the
state
court
requires
of
us.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
trial
judge
asked,
is
there
any
authority
that
requires
me
to
give
this
instruction
on
harm
to
nonparties?
and
we
said,
in
our
view
it's
the
bmw
case.
and
she
said,
well,
if
there
is
not
an
authority
right
on
point
i'm
not
going
to
give
this
instruction.
she
said
that
very
clearly.
so
if
we
submitted
a
separate
piece
of
paper,
it
would
have
made
no
difference;
and
if
we
had
taken
out
the
two
mistakes--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--let's
see.
it's
the
instruction
conference.
this
begins
on
page
17a,
where
mr.
beatty
starts
discussing
the
second
prong
of
this
paragraph.
he
says
--
he
quotes
the
language,
and
the
judge
--
the
judge
says,
well,
i
think
that
that's
covered
by
giving
an
instruction
that
punitive
damages
are
not
compensatory.
and
he
says:
no,
no,
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
the
point
of
this
instruction.
this
is
pages
17
and
18a.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
she
said
she
just
disagreed
with
the
idea
that
there
should
be
protection
against
punishment
for
harm
to
nonparties.
and
she
said
unless
there's
a
case
requiring
that,
i'm
not
going
to
give
that
instruction.
and
she
said--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--what
he
was
saying
when
he
said
okay
was:
i
understand
your
ruling,
and
i'm
not
going
to
continue
to
argue
a
point
that
i've
already
lost.
but
he
pressed
that
point--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
the
--
the
state
courts
both
held
--
both
of
the
appellate
courts
held
our
instruction
was
rejected.
and
this
court
said
it
was
rejected,
too,
in
its
opinion.
and
that's
exactly
right.
you
can't
antagonize
the
trial
judge
by
arguing
and
arguing
after
your
position
has
been
rejected.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
--
the
reason
we
say
that
those
28
cases
did
not
give
us
reasonable
notice
that
we
had
to
submit
a
separate
piece
of
paper
or
change
another
paragraph
in
the
instruction
request
is
that
none
of
them
dealt
with
a
situation
where
you
have
separately
numbered
requests--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
i
--
i
think
so,
because
the
pattern
instruction
here
told
both
parties
to
include
all
their
paragraphs
pertaining
to
punitive
damages
in
one
numbered
instruction,
34.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
but
that
handbook
came
out
in
2006.
and
after
all,
that
was
a
practice
tip.
it
was
not
a
state
court
ruling
saying
you
had
to
organize
your
instruction
this
way.
we
had
separate
paragraphs,
separately
numbered.
they
dealt
with
different
issues.
one
was
the
constitution
and
the
other
was
the
state
statute.
and
there's
no
oregon
case
that
said
that
in
that
situation
you
have
to
break
it
out
into
a
separate
piece
of
paper.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
the
pattern
instructions
told
us
to
put
every
point
pertaining
to
punitive
damages
in
instruction
number
34.
both
sides
did
that.
and
the
court
was
working
with
plaintiffs'
instruction,
taking
their--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
you
see,
the
--
the
pattern
--
the
pattern
instruction
didn't
include
the
due
process
point.
we--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that's
what
we
tried
to
do,
and
the
judge
invited
us
while
dealing
with
the
other
side's
instruction
to
go
through
this
one
by
one.
she
--
she
was
asking
us:
now,
what's
your
next
addition?
and
we
--
we
got
to
the
due
process
point,
and
she
said:
what
is
your
authority?
and
we
told
her,
and
she
said:
i
don't
think
that
instruction
is
necessary.
it
was
separately
argued.
it
was
separately
decided
by
the
state
courts
in
the
prior
decisions,
decided
by
this
court
as
--
as
a
separate
matter,
and
that
is
exactly
how
the
trial
court
approached
this.
her
request
was
to
go
through
this
item
by
item.
she
wasn't
taking
an
all-or-nothing
approach
to
this
instruction.
she
started
with
plaintiff's
document
and
asked
what
from
our
menu
of
additions
was
necessary.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
you
know,
justice
breyer,
this
is
very
similar
to
what
was
at
issue
in
the
flowers
case
which
reached
this
court.
the
alabama
supreme
court
had
said
if
you
intermix
different
appeal
points
in
your
brief,
we
are
not
going
to
consider
any
of
them
if
there
are
any
errors
to
be
found
in
any
of
the
paragraphs
in
that
brief.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
what
--
what
the
state
argued
there
was
that
for
60
years
the
"correct
in
all
respects"
rule
was
in
effect
in
alabama,
and
they
cited
dozens
of
cases
applying
it.
but
this
court
unanimously
held
that
that
approach
was
pointless
severity.
even
though
the
state
supreme
court
there
said,
we
can't
disentangle
these
arguments,
it's
too
complicated,
it's
too
much
of
a
burden
on
the
state
supreme
court,
this
court
unanimously
found
that
was
pointless
severity.
and
if
that's
pointless
severity--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
--
i
--
we
don't
question
the
good
faith
of
the
court,
but
we
say
that
this
is
pointless
severity,
a
rule
that
this
court
has
applied
more
recently
in
lee
v.
kemna
where
there
was
no
issue
of
bad
faith.
the
court
thought
that
it
was
pointlessly
severe
and
unnecessarily
severe
to
insist
on
a
perfect
proposal
in
that
case.
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
there
is
an
earlier
case
that
is
interesting,
state
v.
brown,
which
comes
several
years
before.
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
in
that
case
an
imperfect
instructional
request
was
made,
and
the
court
still
found
that
there
was
a
duty
to
give
the
instruction
based
on
due
process.
and
the
reason
was
that
the
parties,
during
the
charge
conference,
had
debated
the
issue.
it
was
a
fair-enough
exposition
for
the
trial
court
to
understand
the
need
for
the
charge.
and
here
this
really
is
much
like
the
osborne
case.
you
know,
in
the
osborne
case
the
defendant
didn't
make
any
instructional
proposal,
and
this
court
still
reversed
and
required
a
new
trial
with
the
correct
instruction.
it
said
due
process
required
that.
and
the
court
said
that
we
--
that
the
party
had
sufficiently
brought
this
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge
for
federal
adequacy
purposes
even
though
no
instruction
was
--
was
proposed.
the
lawyer
there
merely
moved
to
dismiss
the
proceeding,
never
proposed
an
instruction,
but
this
court
required
a
retrial
with
a
correct
set
of
instructions
for
the
jury.
that's
an
a
fortiori
case,
i
think;
and
also
the
flowers
case,
i
believe,
is
a
fortiori.
there
really
was
a
strong
and
compelling
state
interest
there
in
having
the
lawyers
break
their
arguments
up
into
separate
headings
and
subheadings
so
the
appellate
court
could
follow
the
argument.
but
here
there
wasn't
any
burden
placed
on
the
trial
judge
at
all
by
our
request.
she
was
going
through
these
one
by
one,
and
she
asked
us:
what's
your
next
point
that
you
want
added?
we
proposed
it.
it
was
on
a
silver
platter.
she
didn't
have
to
retype
it.
she
could
have
simply
read
it
to
the
jury
in
that
form.
it
didn't
have
to
be
edited
or
amended.
there
literally
was
no
burden
on
the
trial
judge
at
all.
and
so
we--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
she
did
look
at
the
illicit
profits
point.
and
she
said:
i'm
not
going
to
give
that;
that's
unnecessary.
she
did
--
she
didn't
address
the
"may
versus
shall"
issue
because
she
was
working
with
plaintiffs'
proposal.
so
all
--
really
she
just
had
before
her
our
request
for
this
due
process
instruction.
she
analyzed
it
separately.
it
was
debated
before
her.
and
this
is
much
more
specific
than
what
the
lawyers
did
in
the
osborne
case.
they
didn't
even
propose
an
instruction.
we
served
it
up
on
a
silver
platter.
she
could
have
used
it,
and
indeed
there
was
no
work
for
the
trial
judge
at
all
because
she
was
simply
telling
the
lawyers,
make
this
change,
make
that
change
that
we've
discussed,
so
there
is
zero
burden
on
the
court.
and
you
have
to
ask
in
this
situation,
what
is
the
legitimate
state
interest
that
would
support
this
massive
forfeiture
of
a
very
important
due
process
right?
the
plaintiff
says
the
state
interest
here
is
that
it
promotes
affirmance
of
jury
verdicts
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
due
process
violation.
but
think
about
that.
that's
hardly
a
state
interest.
it's--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--oh,
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
please
recall
that
in
both
osborne
and
in
the
lee
case,
there
was
a
general
state
purpose
of
that
kind
that
supported
the
rule,
but
the
court
said
it
was
an
exorbitant
or
unnecessarily
severe
application
of
the
rule.
and
that's
what
we
contend
here,
that
this
is
exorbitant,
it
serves
no
legitimate
purpose.
it
is
truly
a
game
of
gotcha
that
just
nullifies
the
defendant's
due
process
rights.
and
that
precedent
i
think
would
be
of
great
concern
in
various
fields
of
law.
this
is
a
rule
of
law
that
will
apply
in
civil
rights
cases
in
the
future,
criminal
cases,
all
sorts
of
cases.
so
i
--
i
think
if
this
court
does
apply
its
own
criteria
here,
it
will
see
that
this
was
an
exercise
in
futility,
it
was
an
ambush
as
a
practical
matter.
we
didn't
have
any
reason
to
think
we
had
to
submit
this
again
on
a
separate
piece
of
paper.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
because
the
judge
had
ruled
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law
that
she
wasn't
going
to
give
this
instruction.
it
wouldn't
matter
if
we
separated
it.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
she
--
she
said
that
was
all
she
was
going
to
say
about
the
point.
and
we
said,
well,
that
doesn't
cover
our
point,
because
we
want
protection
against
punishment
for
harm
to
nonparties.
and
she
said:
i'm
not
going
to
give
that
instruction;
i
deny
the
rest
of
your
request,
number
34.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
--
i
think
if
--
if
you
look
at
the
whole
colloquy,
that's
the
gist
of
it.
i've
--
i've
paraphrased
it,
but--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--perhaps
----
[laughter]
--perhaps
i
did.
but
i
--
i
would
just
point
out
that
in
osborne
the
lawyer
didn't
make
it
clear
at
all.
the
lawyer
didn't
even
propose
an
instruction.
we
proposed
a
good
instruction
that
this
court
has
quoted
from
emphasizing
our
language,
saying
--
saying
it
correctly
captures
the
due
process
principle.
so
that
is
enough
to
satisfy
federal
criteria
of
--
of
adequacy,
and
that
is
sufficient
to
preserve
the
point.
there's
no
dispute
that
this
was
preserved
for
appellate
purposes
in
oregon.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
--
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
breyer
asked
about
these
various
cases
from
oregon,
whether
they
provided
guidance
and
a
warning
here.
and
counsel
referred
to
three
cases,
reyes,
owings,
and
then
sorenson.
if
you
look
at
those
cases,
you'll
see
there
were
simple
instructions
proposed
on
a
single
topic
that
were
infected
with
an
error
throughout.
and
the
court
said
if
there
is
any
valid
proportion
of
this
instruction,
it
was
covered
by
something
that
was
said
to
the
jury
already.
so
there
was
no
harm
in
not
giving
that
instruction.
that
is
certainly
not
our
case.
we
have
a
separately
numbered
paragraph
dealing
with
the
constitution,
which
is
quite
apart
from
the
statutory
factors.
now,
counsel
referred
to
the
charge
actually
given
by
the
court
as
if
it
provided
some
protection
against
punishment
for
harm
to
nonparties.
if
you
read
that
instruction,
far
from
providing
the
protection
that
the
--
this
court
said
was
obligatory,
it
invited
global
punishment.
it
told
the
jury
that
they
could
return
any
punitive
damage
award
up
to
$100
million.
lo
and
behold,
they
come
up
with
$80
million,
right
within
the
suggested
range
of
this
charge.
and
there
was
no
statement--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--this
is
page
37a
of
our
joint
appendix.
the
--
the
court
concludes
the
amount
of
punitive
damages
you
assess
may
not
exceed
the
sum
of
$100
million.
and
that,
of
course,
was
the
zone
of
reasonableness
that
the
jury
inferred
from
this,
suggesting
a
global
punishment
to
the
jury
with
no
protection.
now,
this
court
said
that
that
protection
has
to
be
provided.
the
court
said
the
state
must
insist,
that
the
state
must
give
assurance,
and
it's
an
important
constitutional
right,
as
justice
kennedy
said.
and
i
don't
think
the
state
court--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
we
wouldn't
oppose
that
because
this
is
clearly
excessive
under
what
the
court
said
in
state
farm:
where
there
is
substantial
compensatory
damages,
one
to
one
is
something
of
a
norm.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
that
--
that
--
yes,
certainly,
that
--
that
--
that
is
true.
i
--
i
would
comment,
too,
on
justice
breyer's
question
about
what
is
the
ultimate
test
here.
the
court
has
stated
various
criteria
and
opinions
over
the
last
century,
but
the
--
the
key
ideas
are:
was
it
an
ambush,
something
that
couldn't
be
anticipated?
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
yes,
but
this
is
the
first
time
the
court
has
ever
taken
this
u.s.
constitutional
law,
in
a
separately
numbered
paragraph.
and
we
had
no
notice
that
this
had
to
be
broken
out
on
a
separate
piece
of
paper.
if
we
did,
we
would
have
broken
it
out
on
a
separate
piece
of
paper.
it's
just
like
lee
against
kemna
where
the
court
said--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
no,
that
instruction
was
not
harm
to
nonparties.
that
was
harm
for
out-of-state
injuries.
it
was
a
different
issue.
and
it's
true
the
lawyers
there
did
break
up
their
instructions
differently,
but
the
pattern
instruction--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--no.
that's
not
true.
that
case
did
not
accept
our
instruction.
it
did
not.
it
accepted
the
state
farm
instruction,
which
said
that
there
can't
be
punishment
for
out-of-state
harm.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
this
--
this
state
farm
instruction
was
broken
out.
that's
an
option
for
lawyers.
but
under
the
pattern
instruction,
it's
quite
proper
to
put
them
all
in
one
instructional
basket.
that's
what
the
form
instructions
said.
that's
what
both
parties
here
did.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
thank
the
court.
