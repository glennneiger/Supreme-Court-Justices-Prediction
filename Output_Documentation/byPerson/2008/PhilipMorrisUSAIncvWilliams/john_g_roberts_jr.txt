chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
07-1216,
philip
morris
v.
williams.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
one
reason
--
one
reason
to
think
it
may
not
have
been
decided
is
that,
unlike
the
other
situations
you
have
discussed,
it
would
not
have
been
a
bar
to
our
consideration
of
this
case
the
last
time
because,
just
as
you
raised
the
question
in
your
second
question
presented
that
whether
the
award
complies
with
due
process,
we
may
have
thought
there
might
have
been
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
on
a
procedural
question,
but
we
were
going
to
go
ahead.
we
granted
cert
on
the
substantive
question
of
whether
the
damages
award
was
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
peck.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
don't
dispute
that
it's
a
federal
question
whether
that
procedure
is
adequate
and
independent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
--
yes,
that's
exactly
right.
and
i
think
the
purpose
for
the
rule
is
to
avoid
confusion
about
the
ground
of
decision
for
the
trial
court.
if
you
have
got
two
errors,
and
she
says
the
instruction's
no
good,
on
appellate
review
you
don't
know
which
basis
was
at
issue.
there's
no
doubt
here
the
basis
on
which
the
trial
court
was
ruling,
is
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
move
--
to
move
from
the
trial
court
to
the
appellate
court,
if
you
are
correct
that
there's
this
routine,
clear
rule
of
state
procedure,
why
would
the
appellate
court
say,
in
its
head,
well,
i
could
rely
on
that,
but
i
want
to
decide
this
complicated,
difficult
rule
of
federal
constitutional
law
instead?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
we
just
made
a
mistake
in
going
ahead
and
reaching
the
federal
procedural
rule
that
we
reached
because
it
was
barred
by
this
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
that
the
oregon
courts
had
relied
upon?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
i
think
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
your
answer
--
go
ahead
with
your
"but".
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
still
don't
see
that
answer.
you
are
saying
they
said,
yes,
there
was
this
rule
of
oregon
law,
but
you
can
still
reach
--
there
might
still
be
a
federal
due
process
issue,
so
we
can't
just
rely
on
that.
and
if
that's
true,
then
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
concession
that
this
is
not
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
that
would
bar
consideration
of
a
federal
constitutional
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
i
think
it's
the
more
routine
practice
for
a
court,
if
you
have
a
--
again,
as
you
argue
--
a
clear
procedural
rule
that
bars
addressing
the
substantive
issue,
to
go
ahead
and
rely
on
that.
now,
if
the
procedural
rule
is
difficult
and
of
uncertain
application,
maybe
you
go
ahead
and
say,
well,
we
we're
going
to
decide
the
merits
anyway.
but
it
seems
to
me,
under
your
presentation,
it's
the
other
way
around.
it's
a
clear
and
easy
procedural
rule,
difficult
federal
and
state
intertwined
constitutional
rule,
and
yet
the
court
says,
well,
i'm
going
to
do
the
hard
work
rather
than
the
easy
work.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is,
of
course,
another
way
to
protect
our
constitutional
authority
in
this
case.
we
are
talking
about
procedures
for
addressing
the
substantive
due
process
challenge
to
a
punitive
damages
award.
that's
the
second
question
presented
here.
if
we
went
and
granted
that
question
and
considered
that
issue,
we
would
have
protected
our
authority
to
reach
that
question
despite
the
procedural
objections
alone.
why
don't
we
just
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
argue
here
today
the
second
question
presented.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
we
have
some
concern,
that
there's
something
malodorous
about
the
fact
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
waited
until
the
last
minute
to
come
up
with
this
rule
that
was
before
it
all
the
time,
which
was
a
state
court
rule
that
you
would
expect
the
state
court
to
be
addressing
as
a
matter
of
course,
then
--
then
we
--
we
can
avoid
having
to
address
what
we
do
in
a
situation,
having
to
characterize
the
nature
of
that
--
that
consideration,
simply
by
saying:
look,
we
are
going
to
go
ahead.
the
question
is
presented.
we
can
decide
it
in
this
case,
and
to
avoid
having
to
reach
that,
we
will
go
ahead
and
do
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
--
just
to
follow
up,
i
thought
you
just
told
me
that
there
has
been
full
and
adequate
briefing
on
that
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
wasn't
asking
you
to
argue
it
either,
but
i
mean
i
suppose
the
procedure
the
parties
would
prefer,
if
we
were
interested
in
that,
would
be
for
us
to
grant
the
second
question
and
then
have
the
normal
briefing
in
consideration.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
