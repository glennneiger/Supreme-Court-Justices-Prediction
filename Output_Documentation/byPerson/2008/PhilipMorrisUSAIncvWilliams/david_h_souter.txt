justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
seems
to
me
the
problem
with
the
argument
is
that
to
say
it's
inconsistent
with
the
opinion
we
implicitly
have
to
say
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
has
to
confront
state
law
issues
in
a
certain
sequence,
and
that
if
it
does
not
do
so,
those
issues
are
waived,
as
it
were,
not
only
by
the
court
but
by
the
party
who
raised
it.
and
the
difficulty,
i
think,
with
your
position
here
is
that
on
the
assumption,
which
i
do
make,
that
the
--
that
the
issue,
"correct
in
all
respect"
issue,
was
properly
raised
by
the
other
side,
if
we
accept
your
position,
we
in
effect
are
saying
the
other
side
is
not
going
to
have
an
opportunity
to
argue
that
before
the
oregon
supreme
court.
and
that's,
it
seems
to
me,
kind
of
a
steep
hill
for
you
to
climb.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know
you
are
saying
that
but
why
--
why
does
the
disposition
that
you
are
asking
for
not
entail
what
i
just
said,
and
that
is,
in
effect
you
cut
off
the
claim
by
a
party
raised
before
the
oregon
supreme
court,
not
considered
by
the
oregon
supreme
court,
and
you
cut
off
that
claim
simply
because
the
oregon
supreme
court
chose
to
approach
the
issues
in
the
case
in
a
certain
sequence?
what
business
do
we
have
to
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know
the
language
that
you
are
referring
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
referring
to
that
language
simply
skips
over
the
issue
that
i
am
trying
to
raise.
isn't
there
a
problem
that
we
should
be
concerned
with
if
we
accept
your
position
in
cutting
off
the
claim
made
by
one
party
to
the
case
which
was
never
heard
by
the
oregon
supreme
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
place
to
make
that
argument
in
the
oregon
supreme
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
it
have
been
appropriate
to
--
to
hear
the
--
the
issue
that
they
are
raising
and
for
you
to
make
the
reply
that
you
have
just
made?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize
it's
a
federal
law
question,
and
in
approaching
that
question,
i
keep
asking
the
question
which
i
think
i
have
now
put
to
you
three
times
and
have
yet
to
hear
an
answer
on
the
merits
on:
why
is
it
appropriate
for
us
to
have
a
rule
here
that
cuts
off
the
right
of
a
party
that
properly
raised
an
issue
in
the
oregon
supreme
court
and
has
yet
to
be
heard
on
the
merits
in
the
oregon
supreme
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
--
maybe
this
court
insufficiently
appreciated
the
significance
of
the
issue
which
is
now
before
us.
and
i
still
want
to
know,
is
there
a
good
reason
on
the
merits
why
it
is
fair
for
us
to
cut
off
the
right
of
the
other
side
to
raise
an
issue
that
they
raise
or
to
argue
an
issue
that
they
raised
in
a
timely
fashion?
justice
david
h.
souter
didn't
she
also
say
that
she
was
going
to
give,
and
ultimately
did
give
an
instruction,
to
the
effect
that
punitive
damages
are
punitive,
they
are
not
for
the
compensation
of
this
person
or
any
other
person,
and
to
--
she
then
turned
to
philip
morris's
counsel
and
said:
what
about
that?
and
philip
morris's
counsel
said
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
sound
like
much
of
an
objection.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
--
the
problem
that
i
think
we
all
have
is
how
do
we
guard,
in
effect,
guard
against
making
constitutional
decisions
which
are
simply
going
to
be
nullified
by
some
clever
device
raising
a
procedural
issue
or
an
issue
of
state
law
when
the
case
goes
back?
is
there
any
way
for
us
to
ensure
against,
in
effect,
a
bad
faith
response
to
our
decision
except
by
purporting
to
require
the
state
courts
to
follow
a
certain
order
of
battle
in
the
--
in
the
decision
of
issues
before
them
so
that
when
the
case
gets
to
us,
we
can
be
assured
that
there
is
no
lurking
issue
that
has
not
yet
been
decided
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
in
effect
could
then
be
resurrected
to
nullify
our
decision?
is
there
any
way
to
guard
against
that
except
by
telling
the
state
courts
what
the
sequence
is
in
which
they
have
to
make
decisions?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
--
i
see
the
problem.
i
mean,
that's
why
i
raised
the
question,
how
do
we
ensure--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
your
--
your
answer
is
there
is
--
there
is
no
way
to
guard
against
it
except--
justice
david
h.
souter
--by
reviewing
the
good
faith
of
what
the
court
does
on
remand.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
