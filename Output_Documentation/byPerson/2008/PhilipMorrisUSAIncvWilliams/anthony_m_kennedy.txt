do
we
give
any
weight
in
the
case
to
the
fact
that
the
instruction
that
the
petitioners
now
request
and
the
rule
had
not
really
been
announced
clearly
as
of
the
time
of
this
trial?
it's
not
exactly
a
new
rule,
but
let's
--
for
our
sake
we'll
call
it
a
new
rule.
does
that
have
any
weight?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
does
--
but
it
does
in
our
cause
and
prejudice
jurisprudence.
in
habeas,
which
is
also
a
civil
action--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
say
there
is
an
overarching
federal
principle
that
allows
--
because
of
cause
and
prejudice,
we
can
consider
the
federal
issue.
we
do
that
all
the
time.
those
cases
weren't
raised
by
the
petitioner,
but
it
seems
to
me
they're
quite
relevant
here,
especially
when
you
consider
the
importance
of
the
constitutional
issue,
which
was
not
really
--
let's
face
it
--
clear
to
counsel
on
either
side
of
the
aisle
or
to
the
trial
judge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
trial
judge
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
--
of
the
ruling
that
this
court
has
subsequently
made
on
that
point.
the
trial
judge
in
fact
here
said:
now,
if
you
can
give
me
a
case,
then
i'll
give
the
instruction;
you
can't
give
me
a
case.
and
she
was
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
--
it
sounds
to
me
like
that
you
are
confirming
my
concerns.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh.
oh,
you're
--
you're
saying
that
if
our
law
had
been
clear
at
the
time,
that
she
still
wouldn't
have
given
the
instruction?
that's
worse.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
--
your
contention
is,
is
that
this
trial
court
and
the
counsel
in
the
case
had
all
the
guidance
necessary
to
give
the
correct
instruction--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--before
--
before
we
even
announced
the
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
do
that
all
the
time
in
cause
and
prejudice
cases.
we
do
it
all
the
time--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
of
the
importance
of
the
constitutional
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
--
but
it
serves
very
little
interest.
nothing
the
trial
judge
would
have
done,
nothing
the
plaintiffs'
counsel
would
have
done
below,
nothing
the
intermediate
court
would
have
done,
would
have
--
would
have
been
different
if
they
had
submitted
--
what's
it
called
--
the
"correct
in
all
respects"
rule.
if
they
had
filed
the
"correct
in
all
respects"
rule
and
submitted
that,
saying,
excuse
me,
judge,
i
want
to
type
a
little
piece
of
paper,
everything
would
have
been
the
same.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
excluded
the
oregon
supreme
court
from
my
list
of
--
of
participants
who
would
have
done
something
differently.
