mr.
shapiro,
we
are
dealing
with
a
state
supreme
court,
and
our
bottom
line
always
reads
"for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
"
and
it
was
my
understanding
that
a
state
court
can
resolve
a
case
on
an
alternate
state
law
ground,
if
there
is
such
a
ground
in
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
--
did
the
court
--
i
mean,
that's
--
suppose
the
--
what
is
it
called
--
"correct
in
all
respects"
had
been
raised
and
decided
by
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
the
first
instance.
suppose
it
had
said,
well,
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
whether
instruction
34
was
right
or
wrong
in
this
particular,
because
it
was
wrong
in
other
respects.
suppose
that
had
been
the
first
time
around
what
the
oregon
supreme
court
said.
would
that
have
offended
any
federal
due
process?
would
that
have
been
an
appropriate
disposition
for
the
oregon
supreme
court
to
make?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
we
have
determined
it
when
the
oregon
supreme
court
itself
hadn't
made
any
determination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
don't
decide
questions,
particularly
questions
of
state
law,
that
may
have
a
federal
check.
but
we
don't
decide
them
in
the
first
instance.
and
there's
one
point,
mr.
shapiro,
that
i
think
is
--
affects
this
concern
of
fairness
to
the
party
who
raised
this
"correct
in
all
respects"
from
the
beginning.
this
court
had
not
clarified,
had
it,
until
the
williams
case
itself,
the
rule
about
harm
to
others?
in
state
farm,
we
were
talking
about
harm
to
nonresidents.
so
if
i
recall
correctly,
williams
was
the
first
time
we
ever
clarified
that
harm
to
others
included
people
within
the
same
state;
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
notion
was
one
issue,
one
charge.
and
it
wasn't
in
just
one
practice
manual.
there
were
a
few
cited
in
the
brief
that
the
charge
should
be
limited
to
one
issue,
one
point
of
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
the
whole
thing
about
--
this
is
the
naacp
case
you
that
you're
discussing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
this
was
something
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
really
sprung
at
the
last
minute,
that
it
was
not
like
this
rule.
there
were
not
28
cases
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
applying
the
rule.
it
seemed
to
be
quite
a
novel
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she
didn't
get
to
the
--
the
other
grounds,
because
i
think
it
was
all
about
that
paragraph
and
whether
that
paragraph
was
adequate
under
our
then
precedent.
and
i
don't
think
that
--
that
the
--
the
incorrect
portions
of
the
charge
that
have
now
--
are
now
before
us
were
--
were
even
reached
then.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
where
is
this
colloquy?
i
mean,
we
went
through
the
parts,
she
said
i
think
it's
covered
and
it
was
okay.
you
seem
to
be
saying
more
than
was
included
in
that
colloquy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you've
made
it
much
clearer
than
it
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
--
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice,
you
are
not
suggesting
that
we
should
go
ahead
and
decide
the
second
question
when
there
has
been
no
briefing
on
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
portion
of
the
charge
specifically
are
you
referring
to?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
point
that
was
made
that
in
2002
that's
exactly
what
philip
morris
did,
gave
one
simple,
precise
instruction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
--
is
it
true
that
they
gave
one
simple
sentence
stating
their
position
on
--
on
what
harm
to
others,
how
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
--
but
was
the
instruction
stated
in
a
--
in
a
single
paragraph,
but
all
the
other
requests
to
charge
broken
out?
