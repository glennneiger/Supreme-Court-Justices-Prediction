justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what
--
what
issue
was
debated
here
four
times?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
our
opinion
decide
that
--
that
question?
did
our
opinion
say
that
that
question
was
decided
against
your
opponent?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
the
trial
judge
just
stop
there?
i
mean,
if
this
is
the
ruling
in
the
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
--once
the
trial
judge
found
that
one
of
the
other
instructions
was
bad,
he
could
have
just
said,
i
throw
the
whole
thing
out.
why
did
he
go
to
all
the
trouble
of
going
into
this,
the
governing
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
are
acknowledging
that
the
trial
court
did
not
apply
the
rule--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
peck,
are
you
--
are
you
asserting
that
our
remand
order
was
in
error?
after
all,
it
did
say,
"we
remand
this
case
so
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
can
apply
the
standard
we
have
set
forth.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
say
it's
in
error,
my
next
question
is
going
to
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
--
is
it
up
to
a
state
court
to
sit
in
judgment
about
whether
our
remand
orders
are
in
error
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
what
they
took
it
to
mean,
they
--
they
were
just
wrong.
i
mean,
that's
not
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
opinion
concludes,
"as
the
preceding
discussion
makes
clear,
we
believe
the
oregon
supreme
court
applied
the
wrong
constitutional
standard
when
considering
philip
morris's
appeal.
"
and
it
goes
to
the
constitutional
issue
we
are
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
"we
remand
so
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
can
apply
the
standard
we
have
set
forth.
"
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
we
have
been
discussing
this
morning.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
was
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
very
nice,
but
that's
not
what
we
remanded
for.
