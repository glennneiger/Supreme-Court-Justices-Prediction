mr.
matt
kenna
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
facial
challenge
to
the
appeals
reform
act
regulations
could
have
been
brought
outside
the
context
of
the
burnt
ridge
project,
as
long
as
we
had
shown
that
it
had
been
applied
to
a
project
and
continued
to
be
applied
to
the
plaintiffs
on
an
ongoing
basis.
mr.
matt
kenna
the
question
of
rightness
in
standing
need
to
be
treated
a
little
differently
for
that.
as
far
as
the
rightness
question
i
think
it
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case
than
here,
but
i
would
think
could
you
do
that.
mr.
matt
kenna
you
would
have
to
show,
as
your
honor
is
indicating--
mr.
matt
kenna
--not
on
that
pure
basis.
no.
you
would
have
to
show
that
--
or
we
would
have
to
show
some
concrete
harm
from
where
it's
been
applied.
mr.
matt
kenna
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
it
changes
the
standing
calculation.
i
think
it
does
change
the
rightness
and
final
agency
action
especially
question
somewhat,
makes
it
much
more
clear.
but
we
don't
rely
on
procedural
injury
here.
even
though
i
think
there
is
potentially
room
for
it
along
the
lines
of
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
matt
kenna
well,
i
think
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
similar
to
what
the
court
did
recently
in
the
winkelman
v.
parma
school
district
case
where
most
of
the
discussion
was
about
the
procedural
harms
that
the
parents
of
the
autistic
school
children
were
suffering.
there
was
only
one
brief
sentence
tying
it
to
the
concrete
harm,
but
it
did
tie
it
to
the
concrete
harm.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
here.
and
certainly
the
district
court
very
much
went
into
tying
the
procedural
harm
to
the
on
the
ground
harm,
and
that's
what
it
based
its
decision
on.
mr.
matt
kenna
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
needs
to
be
read
in
combination
with
the
footnote
2
to
that
decision,
which
says
of
course
if
you
have
a
regulation
applying
a
particular
measure
across
the
board--
mr.
matt
kenna
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
--
i
think
the
abbott
labs
exception
is
an
exception
to
where
the
plaintiff
cannot
show
that
the
regulation
has
been
applied
to
its
situation
yet.
mr.
matt
kenna
right.
mr.
matt
kenna
yes.
but
i
think
where
as
here
the
regulation
has
been
applied
to
the
plaintiffs
on
an
ongoing
basis,
it's
conceded
that
it
was
applied
thousands
of
times
nationwide.
mr.
matt
kenna
we
have
the
burnt
ridge
project
itself.
and
then
once
we
have
shown
standing,
it
becomes
a
matter
of
mootness.
mr.
matt
kenna
right.
i
think
the
court's
initial
standing
analysis
is
at
the
time
the
complaint
is
filed.
mr.
matt
kenna
no,
your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
say
that
the
focus
is
on
the
beginning.
and
then
as
the
--
as
this
court
said
last
term
in
davis
v.
fec,
then
it
becomes
a
matter
of
mootness,
and
between
that
case
and
the
laidlaw
case,
that
is
a
lower
hurdle.
so
once
we
had
the
standing
--
and
the
marderosian
declaration
is
worth
looking
at,
because
it
talks
about
harm
from
the
burnt
ridge
project
itself,
which
the
government
concedes,
as
well
as
from
application
of
the
regulations
to
be
denied
notice,
comment
and
appeal
throughout
the
sequoia
national
forest.
mr.
matt
kenna
well,
the
footnote
2
says,
of
course,
if
you
have
a
particular
regulation
applied
to
a
particular
--
to
a
category
of
circumstances
across
the
board,
of
course
you
may
challenge
it.
and
i
think--
mr.
matt
kenna
--there
is
many
cases
where
it
was
not
an
effect
on
primary
conduct
yet
a
facial
challenge
was
permitted.
in
fact,
this
court
has
never
rejected
before
a
facial
challenge
to
a
regulation
that
is
published
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations
where
it
has
been
applied
on
an
ongoing
basis.
so,
in
sullivan
v.
zebley,
it
was
child
disability
benefits,
it
was
a
benefit
referring
regulation,
which
said
we
see
no
reason
to
force
as
applied
challenges
instead
of
a
facial
challenge.
you
have
thomas
v.
union
carbide,
which
was
not
a
regulation
telling
union
carbide
how
it
had
to
manufacture
its
pesticides,
but
rather
how
it
would
affect
arbitration
--
it's
arbitration
when
it
got
into
disputes,
which
is
like
national
park's
case,
which
was
held
unright
not
because
of
that
fact,
but
because
it
had
not
yet
been
applied.
when
you
look
at
all
of
these
cases
that
rejects
facial
challenge
where
either
the
regulation
has
been
applied
and
has
not
--
and
then
the
court
gets
to
the
question
of
whether
it
affects
primary
conduct.
mr.
matt
kenna
no,
justice
breyer,
that's
not
so.
the
joint
appendix
at
page
101
discusses
an
instance
where
mr.
bensman
did
not
get
notice
at
all.
the
issue
with--
mr.
matt
kenna
--well,
i
think
even
apart
from
the
appendix,
even
apart
from
the
assertion
that
there
are
--
the
fact
that
there
are
certain
actions
that
will
receive
no
notice,
i
think
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
we
did
what
the
court
has
instructed
us
to
do,
and
that
is
we
brought
a
facial
challenge
in
a
concrete
example
with
the
burnt
ridge
timber
sale
project.
now,
it's
passed.
now
it
becomes
a
question
of
mootness,
and
i
think
the
mootness
question
is
easier
to
solve
because
the
court
has
said
that
it's
a
lesser
hurdle
than
standing,
and
we
have
shown
through
the
bensman
declaration
that
it's
continuing
to
be
applied
to
the
plaintiffs
on
an
ongoing
basis,
that
they
suffer
harm
by
not
being
able
to
get
these
procedures
which
caused
them
on-the-ground
harm
because
the
forest
is
not
protected
as
well
as
it
would
be
with
it.
mr.
matt
kenna
well,
in
that
footnote,
it's
saying
it's
quite
different
from
permitting
a
generic
challenge
to
all
aspects
of
the
land-withdrawal
review
program.
and
i
think
that
was
the
problem
in
ohio
forestry,
where
you
had
this
broad
program
left
with
facts
to
sort
through
and
apply,
but
the
opinion
in
ohio
forestry
said,
of
course,
though,
if
the
plan
had
cut
out
someone's
right
to
object
to
trees
being
cut,
that
would
be
the
kind
of
action
that
would
be
challengeable.
and
so
i
think
what
that
later
part
is
talking
about,
in
national
wildlife
is
saying,
this
isn't
the
kind
of
action
we
allow
challenges
to.
it's
not
final
agency
action.
it's
not--
mr.
matt
kenna
--but
that
gets
us
to
the
standing
question.
and
here
the
marderosian
declaration
showed
he
was
affected
both
with
regard
to
the
burnt
ridge
project
and
other
projects
on
the
sequoia
national
forest.
we
have
the
bensman
declaration
that
talks
about
how
he
was
harmed
in
his
local
forest
from
not
being
able
to
comment
on
timber
sales,
and
we
have
the
subsequent
declarations.
and
i
would
also
point
out
in
the
lujan
v.
defenders
case,
both
in
the
note
8
and
justice
kennedy's
concurrence,
there's
a
discussion
about
how,
in
robertson
v.
methow
valley,
for
instance,
a
standing
declaration
didn't
even
need
to
be
raised
because
it
was
obvious
that,
in
that
case,
that
the
plaintiffs
were
amongst
the
injured
because
they
were
a
local
group
in
their
local
forest.
you
know,
here
we
have
an
assertion
uncontroverted
by
the
government
that
these
are
being
applied
on
every
forest
on
an
ongoing
basis
--
it's
stipulated
to
that.
to
contend
that
the
sierra
club
is
not
injured,
especially
in
light
of
the
declarations
that
we've
submitted--
mr.
matt
kenna
--well,
all
i
can
say,
your
honor,
is
i
thought
we
did
that
by
bringing
it
in
the
context
of
the
burnt
ridge
sale
and
then
it's
a
matter
of--
mr.
matt
kenna
--yes,
your
honor,
we
never
brought
an
as-applied
challenge
to
these
regulations
in
the
context
of
the
burnt
ridge
sale.
mr.
matt
kenna
well,
it's
right
in
the
language
of
the
appeals
reform
act.
there
are
two
parts
that
are
important.
one
is,
it
says,
"a
proposed
decision
implementing
a
forest
plan
shall
be
made
subject
to
notice
and
comment.
"
and
then
section
c
states
that
"any
decision
approving
such
an
action
shall
be
subject
to
appeal.
"
so
you
have
two
elements:
that
there
is
a
decision
approving
something
and
it
implements
a
forest
plan.
now,
that's
the
way
it
worked
under
the
forest
service
before
the
appeals
reform
act
was
passed
and
what
congress
meant
to
keep
in
place
substantively
with
a
different
procedure
through
the
ara.
so
a
christmas
tree
permit,
for
instance,
an
original
christmas
tree
permit
is
exempt,
not
because
it's
insignificant.
we've
never
conceded,
and
that's
what
the
whole
merits
were
about,
that
it's--
mr.
matt
kenna
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
so
if
you
want
to
go
and
cut
your
own
christmas
tree--
mr.
matt
kenna
--you
know,
i
get
one
every
year.
i
just
go
down
to
the
local
kreger's
hardware
store;
i
pay
my
$7
to
the
clerk.
there's
no
exercise
of
discretion,
and
you
can
you
go
and
cut
your
own
tree.
now,
that
is
exempt,
not
because
it's
environmentally
insignificant,
which,
you
know,
it
probably
is
in
most
cases,
but
because
there
is
no
decision
approving
it.
and
that's
the
way
it
has
always
worked,
and
that's
where
we
think
the
line
needs
to
be
drawn,
although,
of
course,
the
merits
were
not
raised
by
the
government
here.
mr.
matt
kenna
i
did
get
the
permit,
your
honor.
mr.
matt
kenna
i
think
the
other
kinds
of
cases
that
are
useful
to
look
at
are,
for
instance,
blum
v.
yaretsky
for
standing,
and
that
was
the
nursing
home
case
where
nursing
home
residents
that
had
been
denied
--
they
had
been
sent
to
lesser
nursing
home
facilities,
they
were
on
assistance
--
challenged
the
way
in
which
that
was
being
handled.
and
the
court
said,
you
know,
the
historical
basis
for
these
plaintiffs
is
that
they
have
been
denied
their
--
they
have
been
in
these
situations
and
it's
perfectly
likely
that
they
are
going
to
be
in
again.
another
case
would
be
the
northeastern
florida
chapter
of
contractors
v.
jacksonville
case,
which
i
am
afraid
we
did
not
put
in
our
brief,
but
that
was
where
victims
of
reverse
discrimination
had
been
regular
bidders
on
construction
contracts,
and
they
were
held
to
have
standing
because
it
was
obvious
they
were
going
to
suffer
these
harms
again
and
there
was
not
even
a
discussion
of
the
declarations.
here,
we--
mr.
matt
kenna
--well--
mr.
matt
kenna
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
would
suggest
that
the
way
those
two
cases
i
discussed
the
plaintiffs
were
treated
is
similar
to
here,
where
you
have
members
who
--
it's
uncontroverted
that
they
are
constantly
using
the
national
forests
and
commenting
on
forest
appeals.
and
we
have
a
reference
to
20
specific
timber
sales.
they
weren't
mentioned
by
name,
but
it's
always
been
this
court's
jurisprudence
to
elevate
form
--
i
mean,
elevate
substance
over
form
--
so
it's
not
a
creative
pleading
exercise
that
can
either
get
you
in
or
out
of
standing;
it's
a
commonsense
inquiry.
mr.
matt
kenna
blum
v.
yaretsky,
and
that
we
cite
in
our
brief;
and
then
northeastern
florida
chamber
of
contractors
v.
jacksonville.
that's
a
1993
case.
mr.
matt
kenna
508
u.s.
656
1993.
now,
getting
back
to
the
ripeness
issue
in
particular,
as
we
go
through
the
list
of
cases,
it
seems
that
the
facial
challenges
have
always
been
permitted
in
situations
similar
to
this.
the
key
question
is,
has
it
been
applied?
so
national
parks
conservation
association
hasn't
been
applied.
no
prediction
that
it
might
be
applied,
therefore
not
ripe.
thomas
v.
union
carbide,
i
think,
is
particularly
instructive
because
there
the
case
preceding
that
was
held
unripe
because
there
had
not
yet
been
an
arbitration
under
the
federal
insecticide
law.
but
by
the
time
the
case
came
to
the
court,
there
had
been
an
arbitration
that
had
passed,
and
on
that
basis
the
court
said
yes,
this
is
a
ripe
controversy
because
here
it's
been
applied,
and
there
was
no
finding
of
mootness
even
though
that
arbitration
was
done,
and
that's
the
same
situation
that
we
have
here.
mr.
matt
kenna
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matt
kenna
well,
justice
breyer,
you
know,
of
course
our
case
is
not
that
typical
because
we
think
we
have
on
the--
mr.
matt
kenna
--right.
i
think
there
is
room
under
the
--
so
the
fec
v.
atkins
cases
is
the
informational
injury
case.
then
there
is
the
havens
case
which
stated
that
groups
that
sought
to
fight
redlining
in
loaning
for
--
discriminatorily
loaning
in
neighborhoods
had
organizational
standing,
not
representational
as
we
claim
here
through
our
members,
but
actual
representation
in
and
of
themselves.
and
i
think
when
you
combine
those
cases
together,
i
think
there
is
some
room
for
that
finding
that
there
is
that
injury.
but
i
would
--
i
would
point
out
here
that
the
--
we
don't
claim
it,
and
even
though
the
court
of
appeals,
again,
talks
quite
a
bit
about
it,
it
ultimately
tied
it
back.
and
even
if
it
didn't
do
a
job
that
this
court
found
to
be
sufficient,
i
think
the
focus
really
has
to
be
on
the
district
court,
as
that
is
what
originally
looked
at
the
declarations
and
did
a
very
good
job
of
discussing
the
on-the-ground
injuries
suffered
combined
with
procedural
injuries.
mr.
matt
kenna
but
i
think
the
record
supports
the
same
kind
of
assertion.
so,
for
instance,
if
you
look
at
tim
bensman's
declaration
at
page
71a
of
the
petition
appendix,
it
says
how
on
those
timber
sales
he
would
have
commented
and
appealed
them
if
he
was
given
the
opportunity,
and
he
would
like
to
go
back
there
if
he
could
preserve
the
quality
of
those
areas
that
he
visited.
mr.
matt
kenna
he
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
areas
in
--
where
those
20
timber
sales
are,
some
of
which
he
had
been
to
before
and
would
like
to
return
to.
and
i
--
and
the
supplemental
declarations,
when
this
came
up
again
and
the
government
pressed,
because
they
asked
for
more
specifics,
those
specifics
were
provided.
and
so,
for
instance,
at
the
joint
appendix
at
page
90
you
have
eric
wiberg
using
the
weiser
river
drainage
and
talking
about
he
wasn't
going
to
get
notice
of
that.
only
because
he
happened
to
be
personally
familiar
with
the
area
was
he
able
to
communicate
his
views
to
the
forest
service,
and
it
actually
ended
up
changing
what
the
forest
service
did
because
he
just
happened
to
find
out
and
he
happened
to
know
it.
so
that's
a
specific--
mr.
matt
kenna
--that
--
that
latest
one
i
referred
to
is.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matt
kenna
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
is
correct.
i
think
the
court
can
look
at
any
documents
in
the
record
which
show
standing
at
the
time
of
the
suit.
mr.
matt
kenna
well,
the
cases
that
the
government
provided
for
rejecting
declarations
were
offers
submitted
to
this
court
or
certainly
an
appellate
court
and
i
agree
that
is
more
problematic,
or
it
would
have
been
more
problematic
if
the
district
court
had
excluded
the
documents
and
said
it's
not
going
to
look
at
them.
we
would
be
looking
at
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
as
was
at
issue
in
lujan
v
national
wildlife
federation.
but
certainly
when
a,
an
appellate
court
takes
up
a
record
from
a
district
court
it
is
entitled
to
look
at
all
the
evidence
submitted
and
especially
when
it's
a
case
like
standing
--
or
an
issue
like
standing
where
it's
a
constitutional
question
that
is
important
and
you
may
look
at
all
the
circumstances
--
there
is
no
reason
to
reject
a
later
filed
declaration.
but
again,
we
don't
rely
on
those
alone.
we
think
it's
the
totality
of
everything
that
supports--
mr.
matt
kenna
--they
were
submitted
--
after
the
judgment
setting
aside
the
regulations,
there
was
litigation
over
the
government's
stay
motion
pending
appeal.
mr.
matt
kenna
well,
the
--
the
district
court
didn't
find
a
flaw.
it
found
that
we
had
standing.
it
was
--
the
government
reiterated
its
standing
argument
in
the
context
of
the
stay.
this
essentially
opened
the
door
by
arguing
again,
"hey,
you
have
no
standing.
"
in
addition
to
"we
should
get
a
stay
because
of
the
equities.
"
and
so
it
seems
perfectly
appropriate
in
that
circumstance
to
submit
additional
declarations.
we
didn't
just
file
them
out
of
the
blue
because
we
thought--
mr.
matt
kenna
--we
did.
but
they
--
i
think
also
the
issue
is
there's
been
the
many
decisions
of
the
court
which
say,
you
know,
standing
after
the
fact
isn't
going
to
do
you
any
good.
and
what
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
clear
here
is
that
the
declarations
were
later
filed,
but
they
referred
to
events
going
on
before
the
judgment
came
down.
so,
we
have
declarations
at
the
time
of
the
complaint,
very
specific;
the
government
concedes
they
are
very
specific;
they
talked
about
both
the
burnt
ridge
sale
and
the
regulations.
we
have
the
bensman
declaration
at
the
time
of
the
merits
consideration,
which
showed
the
case
was
not
moot,
that
he
was
still
being
subjected
to
these
regulations
and
being
denied
notice
and
comment.
and
then
we
have
additional
declarations
after
the
fact
of
the
government
--
i'm
sorry
of
the
district
court's
decision,
which
buttressed
all
of
the
above.
and
it
seems
appropriate
under
that
circumstance
in
light
of
the
statements
by
the
court
that
i
discussed
in
the
defenders
case
and
elsewhere,
that
standing
is
a
practical
inquiry,
that
standing
should
be
found
in
such
circumstances.
mr.
matt
kenna
well,
i
think
there
is
a
difference,
your
honor,
between
setting
aside
a
regulation
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
what
would
normally
be
some
sort
of
nationwide
injunction
such
as
where
you
had,
say,
challenged
a
local
timber
--
local
forest
service
district
for
not
analyzing
nepa
correctly,
and
the
court
not
only
set
aside
that
action
but
said,
and
"oh,
by
the
way
anywhere
else
in
the
country
that's
doing
it
like
this,
you
are
enjoined,
too.
"
i
think
it's
a
very
different
question
where
you
have
a
regulation
that's
being
challenged
under
the
apa.
and
it's
always
been
the
court's
assumption
that
setting
aside
a
regulation,
which
the
apa
commands
a
district
court
to
do,
also
using
its
discretion,
means
that
it
is
set
aside
without
geographic
limitation.
and
so
i
think,
you
know,
the
ninth
circuit
may
have
said
a
bit
much
to
saying
it
was
compelled
by
the
text
of
the
apa
but
i
do
believe
the
district
court
properly
weighed
the
mendoza
interests.
mr.
matt
kenna
thank
you,
your
honors.
