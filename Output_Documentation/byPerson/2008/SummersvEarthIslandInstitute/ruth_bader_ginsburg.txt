ruth
bader

mr.
kneedler,
why
--
why
--
why
is
that
so?
i
am
reading
this
ara
statute,
and
it
seems
to
give
people
a
right
to
notice,
an
opportunity
to
comment,
and
to
undertake
an
administrative
appeal.
why
isn't
this
statute
that
says,
interested
public,
you
have
those
rights,
you
have
essentially
a
right
to
a
seat
at
the
table,
why
isn't
this
statute
like
foia,
like
the
statute
that
the
court
considered
in
the
atkins
case,
in
the
fec
case
involving
information
about
apac?
these
were
people
who
said:
we
are
concerned
about
saving
our
forests.
that's
why
congress
said
that
before
these
actions
occur,
there
should
be
notice
to
the
interested
public,
comment,
and
we
are
being
cut
out
from
that
seat
at
the
table.
it
doesn't
do
us
any
good
after
the
project
has
been
authorized.
we
want
to
be
there
when
the
decision
is
made
to
take
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
statute
says
says
before
there
is
a
specific
action
you
have
a
right
to
notice,
comment,
and
administrative
procedures.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
he
has
no--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
is
that
different
from
foia?
i
mean
there
anybody
can
request
anything.
you
don't
have
to
show
anything
beyond
--
well,
you
only
have
to
show
curiosity.
you
say:
the
statute
gives
me
a
right
to
ask
for
this
information.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
are
saying
that
this
statute
is
just
unenforceable,
because
the
statute
is
supposed
to
operate
before
the
project?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
you
said
the
government's
position
is
that
the
line
is
to
be
drawn
for
cases
that
don't
require
either
an
eis
or
an
ea.
those
--
in
those
cases
you
don't
have
to
do
this
notice,
comment,
appeal
thing.
and
i
thought
the
other
side
is
saying,
no,
that's
the
wrong
place
to
draw
the
line.
it
would
be
the
same
thing
in
every
case,
from
the
government's
point
of
view,
no
environmental
impact
statement,
no
environmental
assessment
required,
no
notice
and
comment.
and
they
are
saying
you
put
the
line
in
the
wrong
place.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
had
had
a
ruling
on
where
you
draw
the
line
in
the
burnt
ridge
case,
then
that
would
have
been
precedent
for
all
these
other
cases,
but
it
was
settled,
right,
so
you
didn't
get
a
determination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
seeking
a
different
line.
and,
by
the
way,
i
don't
know
what
the
line
is
that
you
are
seeking.
but
the
government
says
if
you
don't
need
an
ea,
then
you
don't
have
to
give
notice,
comment,
et
cetera.
what
would
be
your
standard
for
when
you
need
notice
and
comment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
want
to
say
a
word
about
the
ninth
circuit
making
a
law
for
the
entire
nation,
on
a
controversial
question
that
normally
the
court
would
just
rule
for
its
own
area?
