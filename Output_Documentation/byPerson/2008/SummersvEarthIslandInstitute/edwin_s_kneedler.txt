mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit's
affirmance
of
a
nationwide
injunction
in
this
case
is
contrary
to
bedrock
principles
of
article
iii
standing,
of
the
availability
and
scope
of
judicial
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
the
granting
of
equitable
relief.
as
this
case
was
decided
by
the
district
court
and
as
it
comes
to
this
court,
it
involves
a
stand-alone
challenge
to
two
regulations
that
govern
the
procedures
to
be
followed
by
the
forest
service
in
deciding
whether
to
approve
individual
site-specific
activities
in
national
forests.
the
two
regulations
provide
that
site-specific
actions
that
are
excluded
from
either
an
environmental
impact
requirement
or
even
an
ea
under
nepa
are
also
not
subject
to
special
noticing
and
comment
and
administrative
appeal
provisions
applicable
to
the
forest
service.
the
ninth
circuit
sustained
the
district
court's
nationwide
injunction
as
to
those
procedural
regulations
standing
alone,
not
as
part
of
a
challenge
to
a
specific
site-specific
activity.
the
court
did
so,
moreover,
on
the
basis
of
an
affidavit
from
one
member
of
one
of
the
organizations
who
could
not
begin
to
establish
standing
under
this
court's
decisions
by
showing
an
imminent
injury
by
virtue
of
harm
to
a
site-specific
activity;
and
the
court
affirmed
the
nationwide
injunction
applicable
to
all
forests
with
respect
to
all
projects
listed
in
ten
categories
identified
by
the
district
court,
including
national
forests
and
projects
that
don't
even
--
that
are
not
even
included
within
that
one
declarant's
generalized
interests
in
certain
natural
forests.
for
the
multiple
combination
--
combination
of
multiple
reasons,
we
think
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
cannot
stand.
first,
as
with
respect
to
standing,
the
one
declaration
on
which
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
rely
is
the
declaration
of
mr.
bensman,
which
is
reproduced
in
the
petition
appendix.
and
on
page
70a
and
71a
are
the
only
allegations
of
--
that
go
to
injury
at
all
with
respect
to
the
particular
regulations
at
issue
here
from
paragraph
15
on
to
--
the
bottom
of
71a
on,
those
are
allegations
concerning
other
regulations
that
are
no
longer
at
issue.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
congress
has
not
specifically
said
that
they
may
challenge--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
it
could
be
lawyers.
it
has
to
be
a
party.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
there
would
be
substantial
doubt
that
congress
could
do
that,
because
let
me
explain
why,
and
this
goes
to
a
point
that
justice
scalia
was
making
in
the
prior
argument.
procedural
wrong
is
not
article
iii
injury.
the
injury
in
this
case
comes
from
the
application
of
the
regulation
in
a
specific
site-specific--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
--
if
congress--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
i
could
make,
again,
several
points.
congress
has
not
passed
such
a
statute.
and
there
may
be
room
in
particular
situations
for
congress
to
pass
a
special
statute
that
would
identify
particular
interests
that
could
then
be
taken
into
account
in
terms
of
whether
article
iii
standing
would
be
established.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
--
what
i
said,
that
would
be
a
different
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
might
depend
on
a
particular
--
it
might
depend
on
a
particular
case.
in
the
whitman
case
the
court
says
that
the
statutes
providing
for
direct
review
of
regulations
eliminate
prudential
limitations
on
ripeness
in
that
case,
but
they
wouldn't
eliminate
the
bedrock
principle
of
standing.
it
would
be
necessary
to
show
a
threatened
injury.
now,
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--several
answers
if
i
may.
in
the
declaration
on
which
standing
was
based
in
this
case,
that
claim
is
not
made.
and
that
is
the
only
declaration
that
was
made
--
that
was
submitted
before
the
district
court
entered
its
judgment.
there
was
an
argument
made
like
that
after,
after
the
fact.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
okay.
then--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is
conceivable
in
a
particular
case
that
a
person
who
--
who
claims
to
be
injured
by
that
could
sue
to
prevent
that
injury,
but
it
would
not
be
a
challenge
to
the
regulation
as
regulation.
it
would
be
because
specific,
threatened,
site-specific
activities
in
which
there
would
not
be
notice
given
in
advance
or
there
wouldn't
be
--
wouldn't
be
time,
threatened
to
injure
them.
it
would
again
be
a
challenge
to
the
application--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
--
and
--
and
that
may
--
that
may
well
be
right,
but
that
would
be
a
separate
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
was
my
--
that
was
my
--
and
that
was
my
point.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
and
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make.
and
if
i
--
if
i
could
explain
--
if
i
could
explain
the
same
point--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
--
i
--
if
there
was
--
if
there
was
a
category
of
cases
in
which
that
was
likely
to
happen.
most
of
the
--
most
of
the
--
he
may
well
have
standing
in
that
situation
to
challenge
maybe
an
upcoming
--
it's
an
unusual
apa
suit
because
--
because
only
final
agency
action
can
be
challenged,
but
conceivably
a
threatened
final
agency
action--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
the
injury
would
come
from
the
threatened
on-the-ground
activity,
not
the
actual--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
--
if
i
--
if
i
could
make
a
broader
point
here
because
there
--
there
may
be
certain
categories,
certain
instances
in
which
that
might
happen,
but
it
is
--
it
is
the
exception,
not
the
rule.
and
--
and
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
--
in
the
exceptional
case
there
probably
would
be
standing.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
--
no,
and
that
--
and
that
was
the
point
i
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
--
not
in
the
way
they
are
trying
to
challenge
it,
because
they
are
trying
to
challenge
it
across
the
board.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
what
they
would
have
to
do
is
bring
a
--
a
--
on
a
--
a
particular
national
forest
where
a
particular
person
visited
and
visited
a
particular
area
and
there
has
been
a
pattern
of
particular
activities
that
occurred
without
his
knowing,
he
--
he
--
in
that
situation
he
might
well
have
standing
to
challenge
a
similar--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
the
--
the
--
standing
has
to
focus
on
the
particular
site-specific
place
where
the
individual
has
visited
and
if
there
is
a
repeated
pattern
of
a
similar
type
of
activity
that
he
doesn't
know
about
and
maybe--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
i
could
respond
in
several
ways.
first
of
all,
the
due
process
clause
imposes
limitations
on
agency
action,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
--
that
somebody
can
go
into
court
and
challenge
agency
procedures
as
violative
of
the
due
process
clause
until
there
is
a
specific
proceeding
going
on
and
--
and
completed
in
which
there
has
been
a
violation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
is
no
indication
at
all
in
the
passage
of
that
statute
that
congress
meant
to
confer
a
judicially
enforceable
right
to
obtain
those
without
complying
with
the
usual
apa
provisions
for
judicial
review.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
you
--
you
would
have
to
--
you
would
have
to
show
a
particular
injury
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
--
that
is
correct.
and
--
and
there
is
no
indication
at
all
that
in
this
statute,
which
was
just
intended
to
modify
the
forest
service's
intent
to
change
its
internal
decision-making
processes
--
and
congress
wanted
to
restrict
what
--
what
the
forest
service
was
going
to
do
--
that
it
thereby
meant
to
change
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
agency's
own
internal
regulations
which
would
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well
--
and
the
--
the
forest
service
has
--
has
procedures
for
notifying
people
of
--
of
proposed
projects
that
were
in
fact
invoked
in
this
case,
and
we
point
this
out
in
our
brief.
there
are
really
two
separate
types
of
procedures.
one
is
the
so-called
schedule
of
proposed
actions,
which
includes
all
the
actions
in
which
there
would
be
a
decision
memo
issued
by
the
forest
service,
which
includes
at
least
all
of
the
projects
that
respondents
are
claiming
should
be
--
should
be
covered.
that
is
published
quarterly.
it
--
it
is
available
on
the
web.
it
is
also
available
in
person.
one
of
respondents'
declarants
here
on
behalf
of
the
sierra
club
says
that
by
using
that
so-called
sopa,
that
schedule,
he
reviews
every
project
in
all
11
national
forests
in
california.
there
is
also,
in
addition
to
the
sopa
--
and
will
submit
comments
when
necessary.
in
addition
to
the
sopa,
the
forest
service
has
what
are
called
scoping
regulations
which
--
in
which
every
on-the-ground
project
is
looked
at
to
see
whether
it
needs
--
there
needs
to
be
nepa
compliance
through
an
ea
or
an
eis,
but
also
what
is
the
nature
of
public
participation
that
is
required.
in
that
scoping
process
the
forest
service,
the
--
the
local
personnel
at
the
forest
service,
will
look
to
see
who
is
interested
in
the
particular
project.
the
way
this
works
on
the
ground
is
an
organization
like
the
sierra
club
through
its
declarant
in
the
--
in
the
joint
appendix
will
have
somebody
monitoring
this
sopa,
the
schedule
of
proposed
events,
and
will
say:
i
see
that
you
have
a
--
a
certain
project
listed.
i
am
interested
in
that.
please
notify
me
when
you
are
about
to
take
action
to
thin
this
--
this
area
or
restore
this
burned
area.
please
notify
me.
when
that
happens,
the
forest
service
then
sends
out
a
letter,
a
so-called
scoping
letter,
asking
for
comments.
so
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
--
the
organizations
of
the
declarants
in
this
case
have
been
excluded.
to
the
contrary,
these
are
all
people
who
pay
very,
very
close
attention
to
what
the
forest
service
is
doing.
the
one
declarant
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
for
standing
on
page
71a
of
the
--
of
the
petition
appendix,
he
specifically
refers
--
the
only
specific
projects
he
refers
to
are
timber
projects,
and
the
injunction
here
goes
much
broader
than
timber
projects
--
but
he
said
that
for
example,
in
the
allegheny
national
forest
they
put
out
scoping
comments
for
a
series
of
20
timber
sales.
he
knew
about
those
timber
sales
and
he
was
able
to
comment
on
them.
and
the
--
the
declarants
on
whom
the
standing
was
based
to
challenge
the
burnt
ridge
project,
which
is
no
longer
in
this
case,
in
that
case
the
forest
service
--
and
this
is
in
the
administrative
record
--
sent
out
1,300
letters
to
people
who
had
expressed
an
interest
in
that
project
before
it
was
undertaken.
mr.
marderosian,
who
also
monitors
forest
projects--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--anyone
--
anyone
who
claimed
to
have
used
that
area
could
have
brought
suit.
some
of
the
--
some
of
those
--
some
of
the
people
--
people
submit
comments.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
those
were
people
who
had
expressed
an
interest
in
the
--
in
the
project.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
mr.
marderosian
submitted
a
23-page
comment
to
the
forest
service
with
respect
to
the
burnt
ridge
project,
and
that
is
the
other
declarant.
these
are
people
whose
profession
or
avocation
--
serious
avocation
is
following
the
forest
service.
so
this
is
not
an
instance
in
which
--
in
which
notice
is
not
generally
furnished.
i
would
like
to
make
the
same
point
i
was
making
about
standing
in
connection
with
the
--
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
as
well.
section
702
of
the
--
of
the
apa
says
that
a
person
who
is
aggrieved
by
agency
action
is
--
may
seek
judicial
review
thereof.
the
--
the
agency
action
that
is
subject
to
judicial
review
has
to
be
the
agency
action
that
causes
the
injury.
the
procedural
regulation
does
not
cause
the
injury.
it
is
the
on-the-ground
activity,
the
site-specific
decision
--
the
action,
the
agency
action
approving
the
site-specific
action
that
causes
the
injury.
that
is
what
the
person
is
entitled
to
judicial
review
on.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
--
it's
--
it's
by
no
means
unenforceable.
in
the
burnt
ridge
project
that
was
at
issue
in
this
--
in
this
case,
the
plaintiffs
challenged
the
burnt
ridge
project
when
it
was
completed
on
a
number
of
grounds,
that
it
was
not
properly
categorically
excluded
from
nepa,
that
it
didn't
comply
with
the
forest
plan,
but
also
that
it
had
been
approved
without
complying
with
the
--
with
the
ara
appeals
procedures.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
an
injunction,
a
preliminary
injunction
was
obtained,
and
tellingly,
and
i
think
this
is
also
instructive
for
ripeness
purposes,
there
was
a
pi
issued
but
not
because
of
a
violation
of
the
--
of
the
ara;
the
district
court
concluded
there
was
a
likelihood
of
success
on
some
of
these
other
objections,
substantive
objections
to
the
project,
not
procedural
objections--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
enjoined
it
and
then
the
forest
service
withdrew
the
project
and
the
--
and
the
plaintiffs
dropped
their
challenge.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
at
some
point
that
would
begin
to
look
like
foia,
yes.
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
believe
it
--
i
believe
it
probably
does,
unless
you
can
show
that
there
is
an
imminent--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--conceivably.
but
i
--
what
--
what
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--congress
has
not
done
that
here
and
this
is
why
i
wanted
to
shift
to
the
apa,
because
this
is
subject
to
review
under
the
general
standards
of
the
apa.
even
if
we
can
assume
that
there
would
be
article
iii
standing
to
challenge
a
threatened
--
a
threatened,
another
one
in
a
series
of
similar
projects
like
off-road
vehicle
use
or
something
which
might
occur
before
someone
would
be
able
to
--
to
--
to
challenge
it,
that
doesn't
apply
to
timber
projects
and
other
things
that
take
much
longer
to
plan.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
didn't
say--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
mean
to
concede
that
there
would
be
standing.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
because
you
are
right.
and
here
the
agency's
procedures
allow
somebody
to
request
to
be
put
on
the
mailing
list
about
a
particular
project.
and
that's
the
way
you
make
it
--
make
it
known
and
in
fact
that
happened
here.
and
also
the
one
declarant
--
it's
perhaps
instructive,
the
only
other
kind
of
notice
other
than
this
sort
of
situation
where
a
person
says
i
want
to
be
notified
when
a
particular
project
is
going
--
is
going
to
take
place,
the
only
other
form
of
notice
is
publication
in
a
local
newspaper
of
record
that
each
national
forest
has
which
shows
that
this
is
--
that
this
notice
provision
is
localized
with
respect
to
people
who
are
going
to
be
aware
of
what's
going
on
in
the
forest
and
who
are
following
it.
but
the
declarant
mr.
bensman,
when
--
for
another
purpose
is
noticing
or
is
pointing
out
this
publication
requirement
in
a
local
newspaper,
says
that
his
organization
doesn't
want
to
subscribe
to
local
newspapers,
that
would
be
too
much
of
a
burden
for
them
to
have
to
follow
what
is
going
on
in
newspapers.
that's
the
--
that's
the
only
kind
of
additional
notice
the
statute
ever
provides
for.
the
other
kind
of
notice
is
the
notice
you
get
if
you
previously
expressed
an
interest
in
the
project,
in
which
you
basically
demanded
something
along
the
foia
lines
that
justice
scalia
was
referring
to.
but
again,
back
to
--
back
to
the
--
you
call
it
ripeness,
you
call
it
the
proper
subject
of
judicial
review
as
this
court
said
in
national
wildlife
federation,
based
on
section
702
of
the
apa,
ordinarily
a
regulation
may
be
challenged
only
when
it
has
been
reduced
to
manageable
proportions
by
a
concrete
application
of
the
regulation
to
the
individual's
particular
circumstances.
it's
the
application
to
the
person's
circumstances
that
gets
challenged.
in
this
context,
it
would
be
the
application
of
the
regulation
that
says
there
is
no
right
of
appeal
in
connection
with
the
approval
of
a
site-specific
activity.
if
you
think
the
project
was
approved
in
violation
of
the
ara
because
you
weren't
given
a
right
--
after
you
got
your
notice
you
weren't
given
a
right
to
appeal,
then
you
could
challenge
that
in
court
on
the
ground
that
it
was
approved
without
following
the
agency's
procedures.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
purely
legal
issue.
the
respondents
concede
that
not
all
projects
are
subject
to
this
statute,
and
the
district
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
that
--
that's
why
it
can't
be
purely
a
legal
question.
as
soon
as
you
--
and
the
district
court
acknowledged
that
environmentally
insignificant
projects
are
not
covered
by
the
act,
and
so
that
requires
them
an
as-applied
determination
as
to
whether
a
particular
type
of
project
or
even
the
particular
project
is
one
that
is
--
that
is
covered
by
the
act.
and
not
only
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
--
but
that
doesn't
answer
where
the
line
ought
to
be.
and
even
if
the
government
is
wrong
as
to
a
particular
project,
that
means
the
line
has
to
be
somewhere
else.
it
may
be
that
certain
kinds
of
timber
projects
should
be
subject
to
appeal
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
some
other
road
maintenance
project
should
be
subject
to
appeal.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
several
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
the
burnt
ridge
project
illustrates
the
way
that
we
think
an
issue
like
this
should
be
resolved
and
shows
why
the
sentence
from
national
wildlife
federation
that
you
quoted,
mr.
chief
justice,
disposes
of
the
case,
and
that
is
that
a
regulation
--
particularly
a
procedural
regulation
whose
only
relevance
is
in
an
agency
proceeding
for
approving
a
site-specific
activity
--
that
can
only
be
challenged
in
connection
with
that
site-specific
activity.
that's
what
the
sentence
in
national
wildlife
federation
was
driving
at;
that
is
what
section
702
says;
when
you
can
challenge
the
agency
action
that
aggrieves
you
and
that
is
consistent
with
what
the
court
said
in
national
wildlife
federation,
that
a
--
a
court
should
intervene
only
when
and
to
the
extent
that
someone
is
harmed.
this
regulation
can
only
harm
someone
in
connection
with--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--he
was
talking
about
injunction.
i
was
talking
about--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--ripeness
under
the
apa
but
it
ties
in
--
it
ties
into
the
injunctive
relief
if
i
just
could
address
that
for
the
moment.
injunctive
relief
is
--
is
discretionary
and
section
702
of
the
apa
says
nothing
in
the
statute
limit
a
court's
ability
to
deny
relief
on
appropriate
equitable
grounds.
and
this
is
best
illustrated
by
the
--
suppose
a
regulation
was
challenged
by
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
conviction
and
the
plaintiff
says
the
regulation
is
invalid
on
its
face.
the
apa
says
set
it
aside,
but
surely
the
district
court
dismissing
that
indictment
would
not
be
setting
aside
the
regulation
on
a
nationwide
basis.
the
effect
of
a
declaratory
judgment
even
one
rendered
in
the
course
of
dismissing
an
indictment,
if
you
call
that
a
declaration,
is
--
is
governed
by
the
law
of
judgments,
not
by
--
not
by
a
court
reaching
out
and
extending
its
ruling
to
people
and
forests
and
projects
that
are
not
before
--
not
before
the
court.
and
the
burnt
ridge
project
shows
the
way
in
which
this
could
be
challenged.
a
particular
project
where
there
was
not
an
appeal,
if
someone
wants
to
object
to
the
project
on
that
ground
or
any
other
ground,
he
--
he
can
challenge
that
project,
and
there
may
be
other
grounds
on
which
that
project
might
be
invalid
which
is
an
additional
reason
not
to
anticipate
a
legal
defect
but
to
--
but
to
wait
until
it's
applied.
the
final
thing
i
wanted
to
say
is
about
the
claim
of
procedural
injury
and
that
this
might
be
like
foia
or
something
like
this.
i
think
it's
instructive
that
the
--
that
the
ara
is
not
written
in
terms
of
conferring
rights
on
individuals.
it's
a
direction
to
the
forest
service
to
prepare
a
--
to
establish
an
appeal
mechanism,
in
other
words,
do
what
the
agency
normally
does
to
establish
procedures
for
administering
things.
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
text
that
suggests
that
it
was
intended
to
confer
the
extraordinary
sort
of
right
of
immediate
access
to
the
court
for
purely
procedural
grounds.
it
was
just
meant
to
fine-tune
the
agency's
own
internal
administrative
procedures,
which
section
706
of
the
apa
makes
clear
can
only
be
challenged
in
a
challenge
to
the
final
agency
action
in
which
the
procedures
are
applied.
