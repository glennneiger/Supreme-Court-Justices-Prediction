justice

h.

mr.
kneedler,
don't
we
have
to
assess
the
need
for
--
for
showing
a
specific
threatened
injury
on
a
--
on
a
somewhat
elastic
standard
in
a
case
like
this?
because
the
claim
is
made
on
the
other
side
that
if
we
do
not
allow,
if
we
do
not
find
standing
to
challenge
the
regulation
per
se,
there
are
going
to
be
a
number
of
specific
instances
which
in
practical
terms
can
never
be
challenged
when
that
regulation
is
applied.
there
were
one
or
two
instances,
as
i
recall,
of
cases
in
which
on
your
theory
there
could
be
no
challenge
because
the
announcement
of
the
action
was
made
on
the
very
date
that
the
action
was
taken.
so
that
if
we
do
not
find
sufficient
elasticity
and
standing
to
allow
a
challenge
to
the
regulation
on
behalf
of
people
of
the
sort
that
justice
breyer
described,
there
will,
in
fact,
be
a
preclusion
of
any
challenge
to
a
lot
of
specific
actions.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
is
made
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
should
you
respond?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
response
to
that
is
going
to
be,
i
presume,
that
in
fact,
absent
a
specific
activity
before
the
court,
the
--
the
challenge
is
not
ripe.
so
that
if
you
are
going
to
stick
to
your
position
elsewhere
in
this
case,
they
are
going
to
fail
in
that
enterprise.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
doesn't
know
that
in
advance.
that
is
the
premise
of
justice
stevens's
question,
and
it
is
the
premise
of
mine.
there
--
the
point
is
being
made
by
them
that
this
happened
so
fast
that
the
threat
has
been
realized
before
they
could
respond
to
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
will
--
i
will
assume
for
sake
of
argument
it
is
the
exception,
not
the
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
we
have
got
the
exceptional
case.
would
there
be
standing?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
if
in
justice
stevens's
hypo
one
could
show
that
there
had
been
three
or
four
or
five
instances
of
action
so
fast
it
was
impossible
to
challenge
it,
there
would
with
that
as
a
predicate
be
standing
to
challenge
the
regulation
as
these
people
are
trying
to
challenge
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
tell
us
how
they
could
challenge
it,
then?
tell
us
the
right
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it's
the
forest
next
door
that
he
is
worried
about
and
they
have
not
tried
a
--
a
--
a
kind
of
quickie
lumbering
action
in
the
forest
next
door
before,
he
would
not
be
able
to
challenge
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
you
never
completed
your
answer
in
commenting
on
the
national
wildlife
federation
statement
with
reference
to
footnote
2.
what
is
it
that
footnote
2
tells
us
in
light
of
which
we
must
read
what
the
chief
justice
quoted?
