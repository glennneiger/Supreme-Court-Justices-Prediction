in
a
particular
case,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
--
i
don't
understand
your
response.
if
--
if
someone
has
an
interest
in
--
in
stopping
a
particular
action
that
would
be
governed
by
--
by
--
by
this
general
regulation,
surely
that
person
could
--
and
is
--
is
--
is
threatened
proximately
by
that
action,
that
person
could
certainly
bring
an
action
seeking
to
stop
the
action
on
the
ground
that
this
regulation
is
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
govern
that
particular
action,
but
it
would
also
be
--
be
precedent
for
invalidating
the
regulation
in
other
cases.
i
--
presumably
other
courts
would
--
would
similarly
say
that
the
regulation
is
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
statute
says
anybody
in
the
country
can
sue
to
stop
a
violation
of
the
due
--
due
process
clause.
would
that
statute
be
valid?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
article
iii
requirements
cannot
be
eliminated
by
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
i
don't
even
agree
with
you
that
a
--
that
a
citizen-wide
notice
provision
confers
standing,
because
it's
close
to
the
apa.
justice
antonin
scalia
close
--
close
to
the
foia.
in
foia,
an
individual
citizen
demands
a
certain
document
which
the
law
entitles
that
person
to.
this
is
a
concrete
deprivation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
something
concrete.
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
thought
you
were
doing
it.
and
i
certainly
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
there
--
what
if
there
was
not
a
regulation
on
this
subject,
but
the
agency,
by
its
constant
practice,
applies
a
certain
procedure
in
all
of
these
cases,
would
you
have
it
--
the
power
in
the
abstract
to
challenge
the
agency's
consistent
application
of
a
certain
procedure?
you
could
certainly
do
it
in
a
particular
case,
if
the
agency
did
something
that
was
unlawful,
you
could
certainly
challenge
it?
but
let's
assume
you
don't
have
a
particular
case,
you
just
object
to
the
fact
that
in
all
of
its
cases
the
agency
is
doing
this
thing
that
is
wrong.
will
you
have
standing
to
challenge
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
have
standing?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
complaint
is
i
don't
like
the
way
the
agency
behaves?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
make
a
difference
with
respect
to
the
regulation?
why
does
the
mere
fact
that
this
agency
lawlessness
happens
to
be
reflected
in
a
regulation,
why
does
that
suddenly
alter
the
standing
calculation?
you
either
have
been
harmed
or
you
haven't
been
harmed.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
all
it
says?
no,
i
think
it
speaks
of
categories
across
the
board
that
affect
--
that
immediately,
concretely
affect
the
person
complaining
of
the
regulation,
which
is
the
case
in
these
areas
where
you
have
a
regulation
requiring
drug
companies
to
have
certain
--
on
pain
of
criminal
penalty
to
print
certain
things
on
labels.
that
immediately
affects
them.
i
think
that
is
what
footnote
2
is
about,
not
about
--
not
about
any
regulation
that
is
across
the
board.
that
wouldn't
make
any
sense.
where
is
footnote
2.
let's
read
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
need
a
permit
to
have
a
christmas
tree?
where
is
this?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
unusual.
i
mean,
standing
looks
not
just
to
harm
that
has
already
been
suffered
but
to
harm
that
is
imminent.
and
if
these
people
are
regular
bidders
and
they
say,
you
know,
i'm
likely
to
bid
on
this
next
project,
that's
fine.
but
these
people
are
--
you
don't
know
any
specific
project.
they
are
just
people
interested
in
forests
throughout
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
quite
different
from
saying,
"i
am
about
to
suffer
harm,
imminent
harm,
to
me.
"
i
don't
see
anything
--
you
know,
anything
except
in
the
case
that
was
settled
that
has
that
kind
of
a
connection.
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
me
the
two
cases
again
that
you
are
relying
on
for
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what's
that?
what's
the
cite
for
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
you
about
northeastern
florida?
i
have
dug
that
out.
i
don't
think
it
--
it
supports
what
you
say.
in
its
complaint
what
was
going
on
here
is
that
there
was
a
--
a
minority
business
preference
adopted
by
the
city
of
jacksonville,
and
some
contractors
who
were
not
minorities
sued
saying
that
this
was
in
--
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
and
what
happened
--
what
the
court
said
about
standing
was
in
its
complaint
petitioner
alleged
that
many
of
its
members
regularly
bid
on
and
perform
construction
works.
now,
if
it
had
stopped
there
it
might
fit
your
case,
but
then
it
went
on
to
say,
"and
that
they
would
have
bid
on
designated
set-aside
contracts
but
for
the
restrictions
imposed.
"
as
i
read
the
case
there
were
designated
contracts,
of
which
they
said
we
would
have
bid
on
them
but
we
didn't
because
of
this
--
what
the
case
involved
was
the
assertion
by
the
city
that
you
don't
have
standing
unless
you
can
show
you
would
have
been
awarded
the
contract.
and
we
said,
no,
no,
you
don't
have
to
be
awarded
it,
but
if
indeed
you
were
--
you
would
have
been
a
bidder
in
that
contract
but
for
this
law,
that's
enough
for
standing.
so
that's
not
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
united
states
forest
service
manages
vast
tracks
of
land
and
area
approximately
the
size
of
the
whole
state
of
texas.
in
doing
so,
it
makes
decisions
ranging
from
the
allowance
of
logging
and
cattle
grazing
to
the
approval
of
multi-acre
ski
and
recreation
resorts.
in
a
piece
of
legislation
called
the
forest
service
decision
making
and
appeals
reform
act,
congress
imposed
a
requirement
that
the
forest
service
provide
public
notice,
comment,
and
appeal
before
implementing
many
of
its
land
management
decisions.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
a
variety
of
organizations
and
individuals
that
champion
the
protection
of
the
environment.
they
sue
the
forest
service
when
the
service
attempted
to
conduct
a
small
salvage
sale
of
fire-damaged
timber,
known
as
the
burnt
ridge
project
without
using
the
procedures
outlined
in
the
appeals
reform
act.
they
claimed
the
forest
service's
regulations
exempting
such
sales
from
the
noticing
comment
requirements
were
contrary
to
the
act.
they
also
challenge
regulations
establishing
several
other
categories
of
exemption
from
the
notice
and
comment
requirements.
before
the
trial
court
could
war
on
the
merits
of
these
challenges,
the
parties
settled
the
entirety
of
their
dispute
over
burnt
ridge.
over
the
government's
objection
however,
the
trial
court
went
on
to
hold
a
variety
of
forest
service
regulations
unlawful
including
the
regulation
exempting
small
fire
salvage
sales.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
i'm
part
and
reversed
in-part,
holing
that
plaintiff's
lack
standing
to
challenge
regulations
not
at
issue
at
in
the
burnt
ridge
project,
but
also
holding
that
despite
the
settlement,
plaintiffs
had
standing
to
challenge
the
regulations
that
had
been
applied
at
burnt
ridge.
we
granted
certiorari
as
to
only
the
portion
of
the
judgment
invalidating
the
regulations
at
issue
at
burnt
ridge.
we
have
long
held
that
the
judicial
power
established
by
article
iii
of
the
constitution
is
not
a
self-initiating
power,
but
can
only
act
at
the
instance
of
a
plaintiff
who
has
standing
to
complain,
that
is,
who
claims
to
have
suffered
or
to
be
in
immediate
danger
of
suffering,
concrete
particularized
injury
at
the
hands
of
the
private
or
government
defendant.
when
a
government
defendant
is
at
issue,
this
doctrine
of
standing
has
a
significant
effect
upon
the
separation
and
equilibration
of
powers,
preventing
the
courts
from
exercising
constant
supervision
over
the
actions
of
congress
and
the
executive.
only
when
someone
claims
concrete
particularized
harm
can
the
courts
intervene.
broad
concerns
shared
by
all
citizens,
such
as
an
interest
in
good
government
or
in
the
health
of
the
forests
are
not
sufficient
to
establish
standing,
rather,
to
obtain
injunctive
relief
a
plaintiff
must
be
eminently
threatened
with
concrete
and
identifiable
injury
to
his
personal
interests.
in
the
context,
the
forest
management,
harm
to
a
plaintiff's
recreational
or
even
mere
aesthetic
interest
is
enough.
environmental
organizations
moreover,
like
the
plaintiffs
here,
may
demonstrate
that
they
have
standing
by
showing
that
one
of
their
members
has
it.
in
support
of
their
claim
of
standing
to
challenge
the
regulations,
respondents
point
to
the
injury
that
organization
members
would
have
suffered
had
the
burnt
ridge
project
gone
forward.
the
government
concedes
that
until
the
dispute
over
the
burnt
ridge
project
was
settled,
plaintiffs
had
shown
an
eminent
threat
of
injury
to
the
recreational
interest
of
at
least
one
identified
member,
but
the
burnt
ridge
project
is
now
off
the
table.
the
parties
settled.
the
timber
sale
is
not
going
to
happen
and
the
plaintiffs
can
no
longer
claim
that
they
are
at
risk
of
injury
from
it.
we
know
of
no
case
and
no
principle
that
would
find
standing
to
continue
to
exist
after
the
claimed
threat
injury
has
been
removed
by
settlement.
the
plaintiffs
argue
that
they
have
standing
to
challenge
the
regulation's
application
to
other
salvaged
sales
of
fire
damaged
timber
based
on
the
affidavit
of
another
organization
member
who
has
visited
many
national
forests
and
plans
visit
others
in
the
future,
but
his
affidavit
does
not
asset
a
specific
plan
to
visit
any
particular
site
where
the
forest
service
threatens
to
apply
the
challenge
regulations,
nor
does
it
allege
that
any
particular
future
application
of
the
regulations
will
harm
the
affiant.
standing
requires
more
than
mere
idle
speculation
that
one
may
at
some
unknown
point
in
the
future
visits
some
unidentified
sites
subject
to
the
regulations.
under
the
test
we
set
forth
in
lujan
versus
defenders
of
wildlife,
it
requires
a
concrete
plan
to
visit
a
particular
site
at
a
particular
time.
the
affinal
so
alleges
that
the
forest
service's
use
of
the
regulations
caused
him
injury
in
the
past,
but
of
course
past
injury
is
insufficient
to
confer
standing
to
obtain
future
injunctive
relief.
finally,
plaintiffs
argue
that
they
have
standing
because
they
have
suffered
so-called
procedural
injury.
the
appeals
reform
act
gives
citizens
the
right
to
comment
on
forest
service's
actions,
and
plaintiffs
claim
that
they
have
standing
because
they
were
denied
this
right,
but
this
kind
of
procedural
injury
in
the
abstract
is
insufficient
to
create
standing.
standing
exists
only
when
deprivation
of
a
procedural
right
threatens
injury
to
a
concrete
interest.
congress'
conferral
of
a
procedural
right
can
overcome
the
normal
requirement
that
a
plaintiff
must
show
that
the
action
he
seeks
from
the
court
will
readdress
his
harm,
that
is
to
say
even
though
after
observance
of
the
procedural
requirements,
the
forest
service
might
still
proceed
with
the
challenge
project
causing
a
harm
to
which
the
plaintiff
objects.
standing
would
nonetheless
exist,
but
the
requirement
of
a
claim
of
concrete
particularized
harm
cannot
be
dispensed
with.
we
thus
hold
that
plaintiffs
lack
standing
to
challenge
the
forest
service's
regulations.
we
find
it
unnecessary
to
address
other
arguments
raised
by
the
parties
including
the
government's
claim
that
challenge
to
the
regulations
was
not
right
up
on
the
administrative
procedure
act.
we
accordingly
affirm
the
ninth
circuit's
dismissal
of
the
claims
not
at
issue
at
burnt
ridge
and
reverse
the
remainder
of
its
judgment.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
