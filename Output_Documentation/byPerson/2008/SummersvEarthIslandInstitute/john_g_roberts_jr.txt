chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-463,
summers
v.
earth
island
institute.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
was
before
the
project
was
undertaken?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
friend
on
the
other
side
says
that
that
doesn't
make
too
much
sense
because
the
issue
in
every
case
is
going
to
be
the
same,
a
purely
legal
issue,
and
so
waiting
for
the
application
doesn't
make
any
sense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
kenna.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on
it
at
least
as
an
alternative
ground,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
to
read
just
one
sentence
to
you
from
the
national
wildlife
federation
case,
because
i
think
it's
the
biggest
hurdle
you
face.
it's
on
page
15
of
the
government's
brief.
it
says:
"a
regulation
is
not
ordinarily
considered
the
type
of
agency
action
ripe
for
judicial
review
under
the
apa
until
the
scope
of
the
controversy
has
been
reduced
to
more
manageable
proportions
and
it's
factual
components
flushed
out
by
some
concrete
action
applying
the
regulation
to
the
claimant's
situation.
"
it
seems
like
a
high
hurdle
for
you
to
surmount.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
abbott
labs
exception,
isn't
it?
i
don't
think
anybody
suggests
that
that
is
applicable
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
when
his
primary
conduct
is
nonetheless
going
to
be
affected?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
know,
the
drug
companies
have
to
do
something.
well,
they
don't
--
you
know,
they
have
to
do
it
before
they
can
--
they
don't
have
to
wait
until
they
are
sent
to
jail
to
say
that
their
conduct
has
been
affected.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
have
not
pointed
to
a
particular
fact
under
any
of
these
affidavits
when
it
was
applied
to
any
of
the
plaintiffs.
in
what
the
national
wildlife
federation
case
said,
"some
concrete
action
applying
the
regulation
to
the
claimant's
situation.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
haven't
shown
any
standing
with
respect
to
the
burnt
ridge
project
on
an
ongoing
basis
because
that
has
been
settled.
it's
outweighed
--
it's
out
the
door.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
in
for
a
penny,
in
for
a
pound.
if
you
show
standing
with
respect
to
discreet
action
d,
you
can
challenge
a,
b,
and
c?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
now
have
footnote
2,
and
it
refers,
as
you
say,
to
a
particular
measure
that
applies
across
the
board
to
all
individual
classifications.
it
goes
on
to
say,
which
is
final,
"and
has
become
ripe
for
review
in
the
manner
we
discussed
in
the
text.
"
then
we
say,
or
justice
scalia
says,
"it
can
of
course
be
challenged
under
the
apa
by
a
person
adversely
affected.
"
"and
although
that
may
have
the
effect
when
they
get
a
general
decision
invalidating
a
program,
it
says
that
a
quite
different
from
permitting
a
generic
challenge
to
all
aspects
of
the
program
as
though
that
itself
constituted
a
final
agency
action.
"
so
you
still
have
to
become
ripe
for
review
in
the
manner
discussed,
which
was
the
sentence
that
i
read
to
you
earlier,
and
the
challenge
can
only
be
brought
by
a
person
adversely
affected.
i
don't
see
how
footnote
2
undermines
the
sentence
i
have
read
to
you
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
says
--
it
says,
if
it's
become
ripe
for
review
in
the
manner
discussed
in
text.
in
other
words,
if
it
has
been
applied
to
a
particular
individual
adversely
affected
then,
quote,
"a
person
adversely
affected
may
bring
a
challenge.
"
and
i
don't
--
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
restatement
of
the
sentence
i
read
you
earlier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
be
like
in
footnote
2,
the
general
program.
yes,
they
are
saying
these
types
of
activities
we
don't
do
the
notice
and
comment
and
appeal.
that's
the
general
program.
but
you
have
to
wait
until
it's
applied
to
a
particular
individual
who
is
adversely
affected.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
cut
down
a
tree
in
the
national
forest
without
approval?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
where
is
"there"?
he
would
like
to
go
back
where?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
isn't
one
of
those
after-submitted
declarations,
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
don't
we
generally
not
look
at
after-submitted
declarations
in
determining
standing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
--
if
yesterday
you
submitted
a
declaration,
we
would
look
at
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
later
filed,
where
along
the
district
court
proceedings
were
they
filed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
lose
that
again,
you
figure,
well,
i've
got
some
more
--
i
can
get
some
more
declarations.
the
reason
we
don't
look
at
after-submitted
declarations
is
because
there
has
to
be
under
the
normal
rule,
an
end
to
litigation
at
a
particular
time.
it
seems
to
me
this
would
be
an
endless
process.
you
know,
every
time
the
district
court
identifies
a
particular
flaw,
you
would
say
okay,
here's
a
declaration,
and
then
they
say,
well,
here's
another
basis,
well,
here's
another
declaration.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
what
our
cases
sanction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
filed
them
after
judgment,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
three
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-463,
summers
versus
earth
island
institute.
