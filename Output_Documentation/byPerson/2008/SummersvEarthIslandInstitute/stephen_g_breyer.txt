justice
stephen
g.
breyer
standing
itself,
i
mean,
it's
a
little
unusual.
suppose
--
i
mean,
congress
here
has
passed
a
statute
and
the
statute
specifically
aims
at
a
class
of
litigants.
and
it
says
to
the
class
of
litigants,
if
you
are
a
member
of
it,
we
are
telling
you
what
we
want
the
agency
to
do
and
that
is
to
promulgate
a
certain
appeal
procedure.
now,
if
you
are
a
member
of
the
class
that
frequently
litigates
and
you
frequently
take
advantage
of
that
procedure,
why
aren't
you
heard
as
a
litigant,
at
least
enough
for
article
iii?
and
we
know
as
far
as
prudential
standing
is
concerned,
congress
wanted
to
give
you
standing,
so
i
think
would
it
take
care
of
that.
are
you
saying
no
matter
--
that
just
normal
litigants
in
the
courts
who
reappear
time
and
time
again
in
certain
kinds
of
cases,
don't
have
standing
to
challenge
a
procedural
rule,
if
congress
under
article
iii
and
congress
specifically
tells
them
they
can?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
imagine
that
congress
did,
congress
did
say:
by
the
way,
lawyers
who
have
handled
17
tort
cases
in
the
last
year
where
the
value
has
been
more
than
$500,000
and
who
will
sign
an
affidavit
saying
they
intend
to
continue
in
that
branch
may
appeal
from
the
court's
promulgation
of
the
following
general
rule,
dah,
dah,
dah.
and
that
constitution
prohibits
congress
from
doing
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
those
who
--
fine,
forget
that,
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
article
iii
and
at
westminster
--
at
westminster,
when
westminster,
whatever
they
had,
they
must
have
had
some
procedural
rules,
and
sometimes
they
had
general
procedural
rules
--
i
don't
know
what
the
history
is;
i
could
look
it
up.
but
i
would
be
amazed
if
the
lawyers
at
that
time
or
the
clients
who
had
certain
cases
were
not
permitted
to
challenge
those
rules
as
contrary
to
some
other
rules.
do
we
know
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
generally.
because
you
have
a
special
procedure,
here's
what
you
can
generally
challenge
our
rules.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
then
your
answer
is,
if
congress
says
you
can
do
it,
have
a
general
challenge
to
people
who
generally
appear,
your
answer
is
if
congress
says
they
could
do
it,
article
iii
doesn't
stop
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
what's
the
answer
to
that
different
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
am
pursuing
this,
but
i'm
actually
having
a
hard
time
with
this.
suppose
--
suppose
congress
passes
a
statute;
the
statute
says
every
citizen
of
the
united
states
has
a
right
to
receive
notice
of
a
certain
set
of
forest
service
actions.
everybody.
we
want
everybody
who
wants
it
to
have
notice.
now,
if
somebody
really
wants
that
notice
and
they
don't
get
it,
can
they
sue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
any
case,
i'm
trying
to
make
it
look
like
foia.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
just
what
i
am
trying
to
do,
and
you
say
yes,
they
probably
could,
at
least
if
you
are
just
supposed
to
get
a
piece
of
paper
that
says
"notice".
now
suppose
congress
says,
if
you
can
show
you
are
the
kind
of
person
who
regularly
asks
and
needs
such
notices,
and
if
a
regulation
is
promulgated
interpreting
this
statute,
you
can
challenge
that
reg
prior
to
enforcement.
now
does
that
violate
article
iii?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
they
did
this.
suppose
they
said
each
agency
has
the
legal
power
to
promulgate
regs
interpreting
foia
as
to
when
you
get
the
thing,
and
when
you
don't,
and
moreover
people
who
are
regular
foia
requesters
can
challenge
those
regs
prior
to
enforcement;
what
about
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
am
looking
for
a
principle
that
is
going
to
help
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
they
are
asking
you
on
this
--
it
was
at
least
a
problem
for
me
--
i
think
it's
tough
on
rightness
is
because
the
government
is
saying
here:
look,
you
want
to
challenge
it
outside
the
context
of
a
particular
action
that
you
don't
like.
well,
there's
never
going
to
be
an
action,
never
going
to
be
such
an
action
that
we
are
going
to
take
that
you
won't
find
out
about,
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
challenge
in
that
context
if
you
are
really
hurt.
there
isn't
one.
you
can't
name
one
that's
ever
been
or
imagine
one
that
ever
will
be,
okay?
now,
is
that
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see
where
they
are
going
next.
and
if
you
--
suppose
that
the
thing
you
just
told
me,
too,
has
problems
or
suppose
it's
pretty
hard
to
find
one,
then
the
--
why
this
has
never
been
decided
and
why
it's
difficult.
because
i
would
start
with
abbott
labs
and
say
there
are
three
considerations.
how
easy
is
it
now
to
solve
the
legal
problem?
here?
perfectly
easy.
nothing's
going
to
change.
factor
two,
how
likely
is
it
that
they
will
work
with
this
legal
rule
and
change
it
around
here?
zero.
but
three,
what
kind
of
harm
is
it
going
to
cause
to
the
plaintiff
if
you
were
to
deny
him
relief
now?
and
they
are
saying
here
that's
also
zero
or
next
to
zero.
so
what
do
you
do
if
the
factor
that
cuts
one
way
is
zero
and
the
factor
that
cuts
the
other
way
is
zero,
or
near
zero?
now,
i
have
to
admit
i
have
never
seen
a
case
on
that.
i
don't
know
if
there
has
been
one
before,
and
i
don't
know
exactly
what
to
do.
and
if
you
can
go
read
the
appendix,
maybe
i
can
escape
the
zero.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
go
back
to
standing
for
a
minute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
may
have
looked
this
up
and
may
have
found
something
here.
suppose
an
organization
that
has
a
purely
ideological
interest,
so
it
can't
get
into
federal
court,
nonetheless
can
go
before
an
agency;
but
they
are
not
going
to
get
into
federal
court.
now,
suppose
that
agency
then
has
a
reg
that
they
think
is
lawful
and
makes
their
life
more
difficult.
i
guess
that
the
fact
that
they
suffer
a
procedural
injury
would
not
get
them
into
court.
they
are
already
somebody
who
doesn't;
they
don't.
so
i
can
imagine
cases
saying
that.
contrast
that
with
the
case
with
a
person
who
has
a
very
concrete
specific
injury,
a
terrible
allergy
to
chemical
x,
and
they
often
litigate
that
there
is
too
much
chemical
x,
and
now
they
are
before
an
agency
and
they
frequently
complain
about
chemical
x,
but
they
don't
have
a
particular
case,
but
they
will
often
be
there.
now,
the
agency
promulgates
a
procedural
regulation
that
hurts
those
people
who
normally
have
a
concrete
injury.
all
right?
there
i
wonder
if
that
purely
procedural
injury
cannot
serve
as
a
basis
for
standing.
now,
do
the
cases
ask
--
so
i
am
contrasting
the
two
kinds
of
questions,
and
i
wonder
what
you
found
in
the
cases
as
to
the
second
kind,
as
opposed
to
the
first
kind;
and
you
are
free
to
answer
this
as
one
word
"nothing;
go
look
it
up
yourself,
which
is
a
fair
comment.
"
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
you
are
like
the
second?
