justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
you
could
lift
the
podium?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
can
hear
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rothfeld,
i
follow
your
argument
entirely,
and
then
in
the
civil
rights
area
there
are
a
lot
of
overlapping
statutes.
you
can
sue
under
title
vii.
it
doesn't
take
away
your
right
under
1981.
but
in
this
case,
if
we
get
down
to
what
this
case
is
about,
we
have
a
determination
by
a
court
that
the
school
district
acted
reasonably
in
relation
to
these
complaints.
and
then
you
say:
but
we
have
constitutional
claim.
a
constitutional
claim
requires
you
to
show
deliberate,
intentional
conduct
if
it's
an
individual;
if
you
are
talking
about
an
institution,
some
kind
of
not
just
one
incident,
but
a
custom,
a
pattern.
what,
when
you
get
down
to
the
merits,
is
different
about
those?
in
other
words,
is
it
on
the
wrong
track
to
talk
about
precluding
a
statute
instead
of
talking
about
just
plain
old
issue
preclusion?
what
is
different
about
1983?
yes,
you
have
two
claims,
but
if
you
lose
under
ix,
you
are
going
to
lose
under
1983
as
well.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
more?
what
more
is
alleged
in
the
complaint?
i
thought
the
complaint
just
spoke
about
deliberate
indifference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
spell
that
out
--
spell
that
out
practically.
i
know
you
used
the
disparate--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
there
was
no
allegation
at
all
of
that
kind
in
this
complaint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
still
don't
follow.
what
disparate
treatment?
did
you
have
to
have
that
they
treated
girl's
complaints
one
way
and
boy's
complaints
another
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
as
far
as
this
record
shows,
there
has
just
been
this
one
incident
of
harassment--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
we
find
that
out
on
remand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
you're
saying
is
they
made
a
basic
legal
error.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
may
have
a
losing
case
under
1983,
but
let
the
first
circuit
decide
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
because
they
were
relying
on
cases
where
we
did
say
that
a
very
detailed
scheme
was
pre-emptive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
did
that
because
if
you
could
use
1983,
then
the
very
elaborate
mechanism
that
congress
had
set
up,
who
would
use
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
on
that
one
issue
on
attorneys'
fees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
there
been
any
decisions
on
title
vi
and
1983?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
those
constitutional
rights
have
--
i
think
it
might
be
--
it's
at
least
arguable
that
it
would
be
harder
to
win
a
1983
case,
given
that,
as
to
the
individual,
you
have
qualified
immunity,
and,
as
to
the
institution,
you
have
to
show
a
custom
or
practice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
be
a
different
claim,
but
there
would
be
issue
preclusion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
official
--
it's
the
plaintiff
who
would
be
precluded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
plaintiff
has
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
argue
those
issues.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
go
over
--
go
over
that
again.
i
didn't
understand
it.
you
said
title
ix
provides--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--against
sex
discrimination
than
the
constitution
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
explain
that
to
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
give
me
an
example.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
would
the
standard
be
under
1983?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
didn't
go
on
issue
preclusion.
if
they
had
done
that,
it
would
be
a
different
case.
they
said
that
title
ix
is
pre-emptive
of
1983.
and
they
cited
the
cases
where
--
like
smith
against
robinson
where
that
is
what
the
court
held.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
--
you
must,
i
think,
recognize
that
the
elaborate
scheme
that
congress
set
up
under
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act
is
quite
different
from
what
this
court
did.
it
just
said
there's
a
private
right
--
right
of
action.
there's
an
implied
private
right
of
action.
it
didn't
set
up
any
administrative
mechanism.
it
didn't
set
up
any
regime
for
going
to
an
agency
first
and
then
coming
to
the
court,
none
of
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
any
case
in
all
of
title
ix
where
--
that
fits
that
abstract
picture
that
you
have
just
described?
i
mean,
you
have
to
have
a
pattern
and
practice
of
what?
a
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination
to
get
--
to
get
under
the
constitution
or
under
1983.
you
have
to
have
deliberate
indifference
to
what?
to
the
gender
harassment,
to
the
gender
discrimination.
so
can
you
describe
to
me
anything,
any
title
ix
case
that
has
a
disparate
impact?
we
really
didn't
want
to
--
a
feeney
type
of
case.
we
really
didn't
want
this
to
happen
but
we
had
a
test,
and
it
came
out
that
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
describe
a
title
ix
case
that's
like
feeney
in
that
respect
where
we
didn't
want
this
diverse
impact
to
occur;
we
really
didn't
want
it
at
all,
but
it
happened?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
basis
of
gender.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
feeney
says
it
wasn't
on
the
basis
of
gender.
it
was
on
the
basis
that
she
wasn't
a
veteran.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
--
there
is
--
you
are
leaving
out
something
quite
glaring
in
that
respect.
for
example,
single-sex
schools,
military
academies,
admissions
to
elementary
and
high
schools
are
not
covered
by
title
ix.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
your
reasoning
apply
to,
say,
a
race
discrimination
case
in
employment?
you've
got
title
vii
and
you
have
1981.
title
vii
has
a
lot
of
accoutrements,
a
lot
of
text
to
go
through;
1981
is
plain
and
simple.
so
therefore,
title
vii
ought
to
pre-empt
1981,
right?
so
you
--
in
the
area
of
race
discrimination
and
employment,
title
vii
would
end
any
access
to
1981.
it
would
be
the
same
kind
of
argument,
wouldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
what
you
were
arguing?
that
is,
you've
got
an
elaborate
mechanism,
which
you
said
you
have
under
title
ix.
i
think
that
is
debatable.
but
that
was
certainly
the
picture
in
smith,
and
it's
the
picture
in
title
vii,
title
vii
versus
1981.
that
--
that
fits
your
--
the
--
your
description,
title
vii
and
1981,
much
better
than
title
ix
and
1983,
i
think.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
no
constitutional
claim
in
--
what
was
it
--
palos
verdes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
just
said
deliberate
indifference
under
both
statutes,
under
1983
and
title
ix.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
wouldn't
have
gender
discrimination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
responds
to
what?
in
response
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you
wouldn't
have
--
if
you
work
for
a
municipality
and
your
boss
has
been
harassing
you,
you
would
not
have
a
case
under
1983?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
were
saying
the
constitutional
standard
is
different,
so
i
was
just
giving
you
a
case.
it
could
be
a
school;
it
could
be
another
--
another
municipal
employment.
