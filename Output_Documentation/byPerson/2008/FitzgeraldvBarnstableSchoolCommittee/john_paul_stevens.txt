justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
that
this
court
invented
the
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
understand,
mr.
rothfeld,
that
if
you
win
on
the
question
presented,
you
would
agree
that
the
--
the
arguments
the
other
side
makes
on
the
--
on
whether
there's
a
cause
of
action
under
equal
protection
and
so
forth,
that
would
remain
open
on
remand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
may
still
lose
the
lawsuit
even
if
you
win
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
you
lose
under
--
under
title
ix,
a
fortiori,
you
would
lose
under
the
constitution,
i
would
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
quite
clear
that
we
can
forget
about
issue
preclusion
and
assume,
as
justice
scalia
did,
that
the
plaintiff
brought
an
action
under
1983
and
did
not
rely
on
title
ix
at
all,
and
just
sued
the
school
board?
you
would
say
he
can't
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
your
issue,
whether
that's
right
or
wrong.
we
don't
have
to
talk
about
issue
--
issue
preclusion
to
decide
that
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
sort
of
anomaly
that
keeps
running
through
my
mind
in
this
case.
if
you
have
two
school
boards,
one
of
--
two
schools,
state
schools.
one
of
them
gets
federal
funds
and
the
other
does
not.
does
this
preclude
--
no
1983
remedy
against
one,
but
there
is
a
1983
remedy
against
the
other.
that's
your
view,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
sort
of
anomalous
to
think
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
should
it
prove
the
same
facts
in
both
cases?
i
mean,
a
case
that
would
involve
the
same
evidence,
same
alleged
wrongdoing,
and
in
one
case
you
can
rely
on
1983
and
the
other
you
can't.
