ms.
kay
h.
hodge
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
title
ix
provides
for
sex
discrimination
and
provides
a
remedy
for
sex
discrimination
in
a
broader
category
of
circumstances
than
the
equal
protection
clause.
therefore,
having
title
ix
preclude
section
1983
equal
protection
claims
does
not
deny
petitioners
in
this
or
any
other
case
any
remedy--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--title
ix--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--correct.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
the
title
ix
prohibits
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
the
equal
protection
clause
--
or
section
1983
and
the
equal
protection
clause
require
that
additional
intentional
discrimination
that
this
court
found
in
personnel
administrator
of
massachusetts
v.
feeney.
we
--
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
title
ix
actually
covers
a
broad
range
of
circumstances
that
may
not
involve
that
very
specific
intent
required
to
perfect
a
constitutional
violation.
and
clearly
--
if
you
look
at
the
cases,
the
cases
clearly
involve
a
variety
of
instances
which
would
not
be
sufficient
under,
say,
a
constitutional
evaluation.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
an
--
an
example
would
be
the
situation
such
as
this
--
this
particular
situation.
recall
that
this
is
a
case
of
peer-on-peer,
student-on-student
harassment.
in
this
situation,
the
standard
as
decided
by
this
court
in
davis
is
deliberate
indifference.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
the
standard
under
1983
is
also
deliberate
indifference,
but
it
requires
then
that
the
deliberate
indifference
be
shown
to
be
not
just
the
act
of
a
school
administrator
who
does
not
do
what
they
should
do
in
order
to
pursue
a
particular
complaint;
but,
rather,
there
needs
to
be
the
specific
intent
to
discriminate
or
--
specific
intent
to
choose
boys
over
girls
or
girls
over
boys
in
that
decisionmaking
process.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
i
--
i
believe
--
and
that
is,
in
essence,
the
position
that
the
barnstable
school
committee
and
superintendent
dever
are
arguing
in
this
case;
that
is,
that
because
deliberate
indifference
is
the
standard
that
is
applicable
both
under
title
ix
and
also
under
the
constitution,
that
it
is
--
it
is
--
having
lost
the
issue
of
deliberate
indifference
before
the
first
circuit,
that
finding
of
the
first
circuit
precludes
any
further
controversy
between
the
parties
in
this
case.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
i
believe
--
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
we
have
a
situation
in
which
you
have
both
claim
preclusion
--
both
preclusion
under
smith
v.
robinson
as
well
as
issue
preclusion,
which
makes
it
somewhat
complicated.
but
i
would
suggest
in
this
case
under
these
circumstances,
because
the
issue
was
deliberate
indifference
and
because
there
was
a
finding
both
as
a
legal
matter
as
well
as
a
factual
matter
of
deliberate
indifference,
that
essentially
the
two
sort
of
collapsed
into
one.
with
regard
to
smith,
i
would
point
out
to
--
under
the
smith
theory,
constitutional
claims
can
be
precluded
if
the
--
under
the
statute
under
review
it
has
a
comprehensive,
remedial
scheme.
and
we
would
argue
that
there
is
a
comprehensive
remedial
scheme,
and
that
this
court
has,
in
fact,
sort
of
found
that
and
even
added
to
it
in
the
development
--
have
found
that
congress
intended
to
add
to
the
remedial
scheme--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--an
implied
right
of
action.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
there
is
not.
but
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
appropriate
under
the
circumstances,
that
the
--
and
i
would
also
suggest
that
there
is,
in
fact,
an
administrative
scheme.
the
regulations
that,
in
fact
--
that
have
been
promulgated
by
the
office
of
civil
rights
at
the
department
of
education,
in
fact,
have
a
number
of
prerequisites
and
requirements.
they
impose
upon
the--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--no.
i'm
--
we
are
not
arguing
--
we
are
arguing
that
some
of
those
steps
are
illustrations
of
sort
of
the
--
the
scheme
that
was
created.
but
there
is
a
remedial
--
the
--
the
remedial
scheme
leads
to
the
potential
loss
of
federal
funding
--
of--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--your
honor,
what
i
am
saying
is
i
cannot
imagine
one.
and
i
don't
believe--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--i
believe
that
that
is
true.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
and
i
would
point
out--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--that
in
response
to
the
petitioners'
argument
today,
they
have
attempted
to
suggest
that
there
may
be
some
issues
that
were
not
discovered;
that
were
not,
in
fact,
fully
reviewed
by
the
court
below.
and
i
suggest
that
the
first
circuit
did,
in
fact,
look
at
specifically
that
issue.
and
the
first
circuit
said
in
their
decision
that,
in
looking
at
the
equal
protection
claim
in
particular,
that
the
petitioners
offer
--
or
in
that
case,
they
offer,
the
plaintiffs
offer
--
"no
theory
of
liability
under
the
equal
protection
clause
other
than
the
defendants'
supposed
failure
to
take
adequate
actions
to
prevent
and/or
remediate
the
peer-on-peer
harassment
that
jacqueline
experienced.
"
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
is
exactly
the
issue
that
--
that
that
is
exactly
the
issue.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not,
if
you
look
at
the
complaint,
the
claim
that
is
being
brought
under
title
ix
and
the
claim
that
is
being
brought
under
section
1983
and
the
constitution
are
virtually
identical,
which
is
a
second
prong
of
the
smith
test:
if
there
is
a
comprehensive
remedial
scheme.
again,
it's
a
remedial
scheme.
and,
second,
the
question
is:
are
the
claims
virtually
identical?
and
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
first
circuit
found
that
they
were
virtually
identical.
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
what
leads
to
preclusion.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
aren't
other
claims
that
could
be
made
with
regard
to
others.
but
for
the
institution,
it
--
i
--
the
--
it
is
very
important.
congress
established
this
particular
scheme
under
section
19
--
under
title
ix,
and
it
would
be
our
view
that
congress
specifically
and
intentionally
focused
its
--
the
responsibility
for
sex
discrimination
on
the
institution
and
on
the
institutional
recipient
of
federal
financial
assistance.
and
that
if
you
were
to
allow
section
1983
claims,
that
enforcement
would
not
be
nearly
as
equitable.
we
would
point
out
that
it's
obvious,
but
it
is
important
to
consider,
that
recipients
of
federal
financial
assistance
include
not
only
municipalities
that
run
public
schools;
they
include
state
entities
which
under
this
court's
decision
--
under
this
court's
prior
decision
in
wills
v.
michigan,
are
not
subject
to
suit
under
section
1983
and
private
entities
that
are
not
subject
to
1983
at
all.
it
--
the--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--there
--
there
--
it
is
not
100
percent
clear
except
for
the
following,
and
i
would
suggest
this:
title
ix
prohibits
discrimination.
if
it
were
determined
that
a
policy
or
other
practice
led
to
a
denial
of
equal
access
to
the
benefits
and
--
and
participatory
activities
of
an
individual
student
based
on
their
gender,
i
believe
it
is
covered;
and
i
believe
it
is
discrimination;
and
i
believe
it
is
prohibited.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
though,
that
under
the
law
as
developed
by
this
court
in
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
is
that
it
would
not
cover
disparate
impact,
because
this
court
has
held
that
disparate
impact
is
not
covered.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
well,
i
believe--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--i
believe
that
the
fact
that
it
happens
is
sufficient
discrimination
to
come
under
title
ix.
i
would
point
out
to
your
honor
that
the
cannon
case,
in
fact,
involved
essentially
the
--
a
disparate-impact
type
case.
it
dealt
with
admissions
policies
and
the
effect
of
the
admissions
policies
on
individuals.
and,
consequently,
i
believe
that
it
is
not
ethereal.
it
is
quite
real.
but
the
difference
is,
is
that
the
question
becomes
one
of
whether
or
not
an
individual,
based
on
their
gender,
is
being
denied
the
benefits
of,
and
participation
in,
the
various--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--on
the
basis
of
gender.
on
the
basis
of
gender,
but
i
don't
believe
the--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--but
you
see,
i
believe
that
the
impact,
which
would
have
been
that
an
individual
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
participate,
may
be
an
additive
factual
conclusion
which
would
go
to
the
general
discrimination
issue.
the
position
that
--
the
argument
that
we
are
making
to
this
court
includes
the
fact
that
since
title
ix
is
as
broad,
if
not
broader
--
and
i
would
suggest
the
following
sort
of
visual
picture.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
oh,
you
are
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
and
under
those
circumstances,
we
would
suggest
that,
as
this
court
found
in
mississippi
v.
hogan,
that
those
institutions
would
then
be
subject
to
section
1983
review,
but
on
the
highly
constitutional
standard
which
requires
intentional
discrimination;
and
second
of
all,
we
believe
that
that
is
--
that
mississippi
is
an
illustration
of
the
reason
why
the
argument
of
petitioner
regarding
2000h
of
title
ix,
which
deals
with
the
fact
that
--
that
when
they
passed
title
ix,
they
also
reserved
the
opportunity
for
the
attorney
general
to
become
involved
in
a
case
under
1983,
that
the
intention
of
that
language
was
not
necessarily
to
preserve
1983
in
cases
against
recipients
who
are
in
fact
covered,
but
it
would
have
been
to
reserve
the
right
of
the
attorney
general
to
--
to
intervene
in
cases
in
which
either
the
institution
was
not
covered
--
because
you
are
absolutely
right,
there
are
institutions
which
are
not
covered
--
and
as
you
decided
in
mississippi
v.
hogan,
they
would
be
subject
to
section
1983;
and/or
individuals
that
the
first
circuit
recognized
might,
because
they
--
if
they
are
--
if
they
are
state
actors,
that
is
not
the
case
you
have
here,
which
was
peer-on-peer
harassment
--
but
if
you
had
a
situation
where
for
example,
a
teacher
or
an
administrator
was
in
fact
the
alleged
harasser,
that
a
1983
could
be
brought
against
the
individual,
and
indeed
the
--
the
attorney
general
could
intervene
in
those
cases.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
correct.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
correct.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
but--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--well,
i
would
argue
--
i
would
argue,
of
course,
that
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
take
--
would
affirm
the
first
circuit
opinion,
but
i
would
say
to
--
to
--
to
your
honor
the
following:
that
with
regard
to
the
individual
defendant
in
this
case,
who
is
a
superintendent
of
schools,
who
as
we
argue,
the
question
presented
only
deals
with
the
institutional
recipient;
but
nevertheless
the
first
circuit
found
that
the
individual
was
acting
only
in
their
official
capacity.
and
once
again,
that
--
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
and
having
decided
that
they
were
acting
in
--
in
the
individual's
official
capacity,
we
would
argue
therefore
that
the
individual
would
not
be
sued,
because
the
claim
and
all
of
the
facts--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--to
the
--
yes.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
yes.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
issue
preclusion.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
they
do.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
the
court--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
they
did
decide
that
in
the
language
that
i
did
quote
to
you
just
a
moment
ago
from
the
first
circuit
opinion,
which
is
found
at
the
appendix
23a
--
or
the
decision.
essentially
they
are
--
they
are
saying
that
--
that
there
was
--
that
because
no
theory
of
liability
was
offered
other
than
this,
that
there
isn't
any
further
claim
available.
with
regard
to
sending
this
case
back,
i
--
we
argue,
based
upon
the
deliberate
indifference
standard,
which
i
think
is
indisputably
the
standard
both
under
title
ix
and
the
standard
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
that
that
deliberate
indifference
standard
and
--
and
the
fact
the
first
circuit
found
that
--
that
there
was
--
that
the
barnstable
school
committee
acted
reasonably
and
without
deliberate
indifference,
precludes
--
there
is
no
issue
in
controversy
anymore.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
because
there
must
be
an
issue
in
controversy
for
this
court
to
send
any
--
there
must
be
an
issue
in
controversy
here
and
also--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--well
--
well,
with
all
due
respect,
i
would
suggest
that
what
you
have
to
look
at
is
the
complaint,
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
argument,
you
know,
what
was
in
fact
argued.
and
i
would
suggest
what--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
--
that
that
--
that
that
should
--
that
should
be
the
result
of
your
decisionmaking.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
i
--
i
believe
that
that
would
be
satisfactory.
from
our
point
of
view,
because
we
believe
that
the
issue
preclusion
applies,
that
would
be
satisfactory
because
we
should--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--there's
no
question
but
in
those
circumstances
then
as
to
an
institution--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--our
position
is
that
as
a
recipient
of
federal
--
if
the
institution
involved
is
a
recipient
of
federal
financial
assistance
who
is
covered
by
title
ix--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--you
cannot
proceed
under
section
1983.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
yes,
we
are.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
oh,
no,
we
are
disagreeing,
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
difficulty
that
this
court
is
having,
or
at
least
as
i
experience
it,
the
difficulty
with
regard
to
issue
preclusion
and
claim
preclusion
turns
in
this
case
on
the
fact
that
this
perhaps
being
a
peer-on-peer
harassment
case--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--correct.
correct.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
that
is
correct,
except
that
as
we
argue
--
what
we
have
argued
before
the
court
is
that
under
smith
the
question
is,
is
there
a
comprehensive
remedial
scheme?
and
we
would
argue
that
there
is,
but
then
you
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
claims
are
virtually
identical;
and
we
would
argue
that
here
the
claims
are
virtually
identical--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--i
believe
that
--
that
there
is
that
argument,
but
to
be
honest,
i'm
not
in
a
position
right
now
to
reflect
on
exactly
--
i
believe
that
that
would
be
certainly
the
direction,
however,
there
are
unique
aspects
of
race.
and
i
believe
that
that
is
yet
another
basis
on
which
i
would
quarrel
with
the
petitioner
with
regard
to
suggesting
that
title
vi
and
--
and
title
ix
ought
to
be
treated
exactly
the
same.
the
history
of
the
--
sex
discrimination
versus
race
discrimination
are
quite
different
and
separate.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
i
guess
i
--
i
don't
agree.
it
is
our
--
it
is
our
view
that
19
--
that
in
this
particular
instance
--
and
i
--
and
i
think
i
may
have
misspoken
if
the
view
is,
is
that
it's
the
administrative
schemes
that
get
compared.
i
--
i
believe
under
smith,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
comprehensive
remedial
scheme,
and
here
you
have
the
remedy
--
both
an
administrative
remedy
as
well
as
a
private
right
of
action,
which
we
would
argue
should
preclude
the
1983
claims.
moreover,
we
would
also
look,
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
constitutional
claim,
to
the
--
to
bivens
--
to
the
line
of
cases
under
bivens
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
fact
that
when
congress
provides
a
remedy
for
a
particular
area
--
in
a
particular
area,
that
that
remedy
can
preclude
an
independent
action
which
--
even
if
based
on
the
constitution.
and
we
would
suggest
that
that
would
be
--
that
that
is
something
that
we
would
urge
this
court
to
consider--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--well,
that
is
correct,
except
that
this
court
has,
in
fact,
applied
its
preclusion
doctrine
by
looking
at
whether
or
not
congress
has
made
any
statement
in
the
statute.
then
if
you
want
to
take
it
statute
to
statute,
then
what
you
would
be
looking
at
is
you
would
be
looking
at
essentially
rancho
palos
verdes.
and
as
--
as
this
court
did
in
--
when
it
decided
rancho
palos
verdes,
it
remanded
for
consideration
communities
of
equity,
which
is
a
title
ix
case
for
reconsideration
by,
i
believe
it's
the
eighth
circuit
under
the
rancho
palos
verdes
decision.
and
while
that
case
ultimately
did
not
come
back
to
this
court,
the
--
the
circuit
court
determined
that
it
treated
--
it
treated
the
issue
differently,
and
we
would
argue
that
that
is
a
part
of
this
split,
and
that
that
is
--
and
that
that
is
not
the
appropriate
resolution.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
exactly.
there
was
no
constitutional
claim
in
rancho
palos
verdes.
however,
this
court
did
cite
smith
and
did
cite
smith
in
its
decision
and
--
and
favorably
so.
but
moreover,
we
would
argue
that
the
question
is
really,
if
you're
comparing
a
statute
to
a
statute,
which
is
title
ix
to
section
1983,
congress
allowed
for
actions
in
section
1983,
congress
allows
for
actions
under
title
ix;
or
whether
or
not
you
are
really
looking
at
the
issue
as
title
ix
versus
a
constitutional
claim.
now,
i
want
to
just
make
the
point
that
preclusion
makes
sense.
congress
really
did
put
the
focus
in
title
ix
on
the
institution,
and
congress
is
also
seeking
to
have
equity
of
enforcement.
further,
as
set
for
in
the
amici
in
support
of
the
respondents'
position,
we
would
point
out
that
if
section
1983
claims
are
not
precluded,
that
it
would
require
the
expenditure
of
funds
by
--
by
recipients
of
federal
financial
assistance
on
a
variety
of
issues
that
are
totally
unnecessary
including
qualified
immunity.
and
in
the
peer-on-peer
harassment
case
--
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
focus
on
what
this
case
is.
it
is
a
peer-on-peer,
student-on-student
harassment
where,
what
you
would
have
is,
if
you
were
going
to
allow
additional
claims
under
section
1983
against
the
institution,
it
would
--
it
would
intrude
and
interfere
with
the
school's
processes
of
disciplining
students.
and
i
would
also
suggest
that
it
might
also
interfere
in
the
classic
manner
in
which--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--it
is
exactly
our
view
because
the
recipient
would
be
subject
to
the
remedial
scheme
set
forth
in
title
ix.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
i
don't
believe
it's
anomalous.
i
believe
the
reverse
is
anomalous
because
what
you
would
be
suggesting
if
you
do
not
preclude
section
1983,
you
would
suggest
that
the
recipient
could
have
both
the
1983
and
a
title
ix;
whereas,
the
nonrecipient
would
have
just
section
1983.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
i
believe
under
those
circumstances,
justice
stevens,
that
what
we
would
be
talking
about
would
be
the
situation
where
a
--
under
title
ix,
there
is
--
there's
actually
an
easier
path
to
recovery,
if
you
will,
because
it
does
not
require
the
specific
intent
required
by
massachusetts
v.
feeney,
which
we
believe
sets
a
slightly
higher
--
a
higher
bar
and
a
higher
level
of
intentionality.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
your
honor,
it
is
--
deliberate
indifference
is
the
standard.
however,
in
order
to
prove
a
constitutional
violation,
you
must
also
have
the
specific
intent
for
invidious
discrimination
that
we
--
that
this
court
has
not
imposed
and
did
not
impose
in
davis
for
violations
of
peer
--
for
peer-on-peer
harassment
cases.
so,
while
the
discrimination
needs
to
be
intentional
under
title
ix,
it
is
not
required
that
there
be
the
specific
intent
to
favor
one
over
the
other
or
one's
protected
status
over
the
other.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
but
you
--
excuse
me,
i'm
sorry.
you
would
have
gender
discrimination
if
you
have
a
typical
--
in
the
peer-on-peer
harassment
cases,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
institution
was
or
was
not
deliberately
indifferent
in
the
manner
in
which
it
responds.
in
--
in
a
deliberate
indifference--
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
--to
a
complaint
of
--
to
a
complaint
about
sexual
harassment.
if
the
institution
fails
to
respond
appropriately,
the
lower
courts
have
found
that
that
can
be
gender
discrimination
under
title
ix.
they
do
not
in
any
way
look
to
ensure
that
--
look
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
that
specific
invidious
discrimination
that
we
would
argue
this
court
has
imposed
in
its
cases
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
if
you
were
a
municipality
and
--
and
the
--
and
your
boss
was
harassing
you,
and
--
in
a
school
setting
by
a
recipient
of
federal
financial
assistance?
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
it
would
--
you
would
need
to
have
the
specific
intent,
invidious
intent
that
we
believe
is
an
additional
element
and
a
much
harder
element
to
prove
in
that
situation.
ms.
kay
h.
hodge
thank
you.
