mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you.
if
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
actually,
i
have
never
used
this
before,
so
it's
a
learning
experience
for
me,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
okay?
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
--
that
may
be
an
advantage,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
--
if
i
should
modify
it,
please
--
please
let
me
know.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
made
two
fundamental
and
separate
errors,
each
of
which
should
require
reversal
of
its
decision.
first,
all
agree
that
the
question
whether
title
ix
precludes
the
use
of
section
1983
to
enforce
the
constitution
is
a
matter
of
congressional
intent.
yet,
the
court
of
appeals
entirely
disregarded
all
of
the
ordinary
indicia
of
congressional
intent:
the
statutory
text;
the
statutory
background,
structure,
and
evolution;
the
unquestioned
legislative
purpose.
each
of
these
considerations
points
conclusively
towards
a
single
outcome:
congress
did
not
mean
title
ix
to
preclude
the
use
of
section
1983
to
enforce
the
constitution.
second,
rather
than
consider
any
of
this
direct
and
compelling
evidence
of
what
congress
actually
had
in
mind
in
title
ix,
the
court
of
appeals
applied
what
it
thought
to
be
a
presumption
that
the
availability
of
title
ix's
implied
right
of
action
to
enforce
title
ix's
own
statutory
prohibition
of
gender
discrimination
somehow
should
be
taken
to
mean
that
congress
meant
to
preclude
the
use
of
section
1983
to
enforce
constitutional
rules
against
discrimination.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
--
i
guess
there
--
there
are
a
number
of
points
that
i
--
i
can
make
in
response
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
think
what
--
what
you
say
is
absolutely
right.
congress
did
not
expressly
provide
a
cause
of
action
in
title
ix.
and
so
since
--
since
the
question
in
a
preclusion
case,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
congress
meant
to
preclude
the
use
of
section
1983,
is
whether
there
is
a
clear
indication
of
congressional
intent
to
do
so,
that
there
--
as
a
matter
of
definition,
that
can't
be
present
here.
but
--
but
before--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
--
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
i
--
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
--
i
do
think
--
and
--
and
--
this
is
not
my
principal
point,
but
i
do
think
it's
quite
clear
that
if
we
are
talking
about
what
is
the
clear
intent
of
congress
regarding
preclusion
of
use
of
section
1983,
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
expressly
create
a
--
a
private
right
of
action
at
all
bears
very
significantly
on
that.
i
don't
at
all
disagree
that
congress
intended
and
expected
that
the
courts
would
recognize
a
right
of
action
under
--
under
title
ix.
but
congress
actually
in
title
ix
specifically,
i
think,
addressed
the
preclusion
question
that
we
have
here.
there
is
clear
statutory
text
that
answers
the
question
in
this
case
in
--
in
several
respects.
first
of
all,
when
congress
enacted
title
ix,
it
specifically
provided
that
--
it
specifically
contemplated
that
there
would
be
continued,
private
constitutional
litigation
challenging
gender
discrimination.
it
specifically
authorized
the
attorney
general
to
intervene
in
private
litigation
whenever
--
and
i
am
here
quoting
from
the
text
of
the
statute
--
whenever
suit
is
initiated
in
any
court
of
the
united
states
to
assert
rights,
the
deprivation
of
equal
protection
under
the
--
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
on
account
of
sex.
congress,
therefore,
specifically
contemplated,
when
it
enacted
title
ix,
that
there
would
be
--
there
would,
in
fact,
be
constitutional
litigation
challenging
gender
discrimination
on
account
of
sex.
and
congress
surely
knew
that
that
litigation
would
proceed
under
section
1983.
respondents--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
--
the
court
did
not.
i
mean
there,
the
--
the
court
looked
at
what
it
took
to
be
the
general
--
the
manifest
congressional
intent
when
--
when
it
enacted
title
ix.
but
it
did
not
specifically
rely
on
--
on
the
legislation.
the
legislation,
of
course,
goes
to
whether
or
not
section
1983
suits
were
available,
not
to
whether
there
is
a
title
ix
implied
right
of
action
available.
and,
as
i
say,
in
that
--
in
that
legislative
language,
congress
made
expressly
clear
that
it
intended
--
and
intended
actually
to
facilitate
by
allowing
the
attorney
general
to
intervene
in
--
continued
section
1983
litigation
to
enforce
allegations
of
--
of
gender
discrimination.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that
--
that
is
right,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
the
claims
are
identical
and
that
they
have
actually
been
adjudicated.
the
--
the
first
circuit
in
this
case
resolved
the
title
ix
claim
focusing
on
deliberate
indifference
in
response
to
peer-on-peer
sexual
harassment.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
claim
growing
out
of
that
conduct
of
the
same
sort
and
to
the
extent
that
the
elements
of
that
claim
are
identical,
then
we
agree
that
at
that
point
that
would
be
precluded.
but
we
think
that
there
is
more
to
this
case
than
that
one
issue
that
has
been
resolved.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
--
i
guess
there
are
--
are
two
points
in
--
in
response
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
the
complaint
can
be
taken
to
allege
in
addition
more
generic
--
(banging
sound.
)--
--i
hope
i
am
not
responsible
for
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
and
i
--
i
assure
you
i
will
--
i
will
use
them,
your
honor.
the
--
the
complaint,
we
think,
should
be
taken
also
to
be
generally
in
response
to
complaints
of
--
of
misconduct
by
individuals
within
the
school,
but
in--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
--
for
example,
your
honor,
we
think
that
one
thing
that
--
that
could
be
developed
and
explored
further
is
disparate
treatment
of
complaints;
for
example,
the
treatment
of
complaints
of
bullying
by
boys
more
favorably
than
complaints
of
harassment
by
girls,
believing
testimony
of
boys
rather
than
believing
testimony
of
girls.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
--
i
--
i
agree
that
that
was
not
set
out
specifically
in
the
complaint.
the
complaint
did
say
in
a
--
in
a
general
sense
that
jacqueline
fitzgerald
was
denied
equal
access
to
the
benefits
of
education.
it
said
that
the
discrimination
she
suffered
included
but
was
not
limited
to
sexual
harassment.
it
asked
for
relief,
injunctive
relief,
to
bar
unconstitutional
treatment
not
only
of
jacqueline
fitzgerald
but
of
all
female
students
in
the
school,
which
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--yes,
that's
right.
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
there
are
a
number
of
points
i
should
make
in
response
to
that,
your
honor.
i
think
one
is,
just
as
a
general
matter,
we
think
that
that's
something
--
this
entire
set
of
questions
are
things
that
are
better
resolved
by
the
courts
of
appeals
--
on
--
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand.
i
think
that
there
are
--
there
are
unresolved
constitutional--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
certainly
--
i
--
certainly,
i
understand
that
suggestion,
justice
breyer.
and
let
me
give
you
two
responses
to
that.
first
a
specific
response
to
why
it
could
happen
on
remand.
this
is
not
a
theoretical
possibility.
there
was
actually
discovery
that
was
requested
concerning
additional
complaints,
concerning
additional
disciplinary
action
against
other
students,
concerning
requests
for
bus
monitors,
as
to
which
it
could
have
been
developed
that
there
was
disparate
treatment
as
to
those.
the
respondents
declined
to--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
--
that
would
be
one
way
in
which--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--again,
your
honor,
i
think
one
of
the
problems
is
that
this
case
sort
of
went
off
the
tracks
at
the
earliest
possible
stage,
at
the
--
at
the
time
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
granted.
and
it
could
have
developed
in
quite
a
different
way.
for
example,
discovery
was
requested
on
these
subjects
that
i
--
that
i
mentioned
to
justice
breyer,
which
--
which
could
have
been
used
to
develop
that,
in
fact,
requests
by
boys
were
treated
more
favorably
than
requests
by
girls;
complaints
by
boys
were
responded
to
more
--
more
favorably--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
discovery
request?
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
no.
it
is
not--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--you
do
not
have
it
in
front
of
you.
but
i
can
tell
you
that
the
request
was
made,
the
respondents
declined
to
respond
to
it
for,
among
other
reasons,
the
--
the
assertion
that
it
would
not
lead
to
the
discovery
of
relevant
evidence
or
admissible
evidence.
after
the
1983
preclusion
ruling,
and
because
of
the
preclusion
ruling,
that
was
not
followed
up
because
it
would
have
been
futile
to
try
to
develop
additional
argumentation
in
that
--
in
that
direction.
had
the
case
not
hopped
the
track
at
this
point,
if
the
complaint
could
have
amended
--
could
have
been
amended,
additional
individual
defendants
could
have
been
added,
the
case
could
have
gone
on
in
quite
a
different
direction.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
exactly--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--precisely
the
same
arguments
were
made
in
almost
identical
language
in
the
brief
in
opposition
that
are
now
being
made
as
an
argument
as
to
why
this
court
should
decide
the
merits
of
the
1983
claim
or
dismiss
as
improvidently
granted.
the
court
--
i
don't
presume
to
tell
the
court
what
it
was
thinking
when
it
granted
review
of
the
case,
but
it
did
presumably
reject
those
arguments
at
that
point,
and
there's
no
reason
that
they
are
any
additional
basis
now.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
absolutely.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
--
that
is
absolutely
correct.
the
constitutional
arguments
were
made
on
the
merits
to
the
district
court
and
to
the
court
of
appeals.
they
were
not
addressed
by
either.
those
courts
cut
it
short
and
threw
the
case
out
on
preclusion
grounds.
and
i
--
i
think
the
way
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
actually
suggests
that
it
was
of
the
view
that
there
was
more
in
the
case
than
simply
the
title
ix
claims
that
had
been
rejected,
because
one
would
have
thought
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
of
the
view
that
there
is
nothing
to
the
case
beyond
the
title
ix
peer-on-peer
harassment
claim
that
has
been
reject,
it
would
have
ended
its
discussion
at
that
point.
it
would
have
said:
we
reject
your
title
ix
claim;
there
is
nothing
more
to
your
section
1983
constitutional
claim;
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
but
it
didn't
do
that.
it
decided
the
title
ix
claim
on
the
merits,
rejecting
it.
and
it
then
separately
went
on
to
address
the
section
1983
constitutional
claim
and
said:
we
are
not
going
to
address
those
merits
at
all;
we
are
going
to
say
that
those
claims
are
precluded
as
a
matter
of
per
se
title
ix
law,
that
title
ix
is
preclusive.
and,
therefore,
one
would
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
it
in
mind
that
there
was
more
that
could
have
been
decided
about
the
merits--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--and
we'll
find
that
out
on
remand.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
--
that
is
absolutely
correct.
that
is
our--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
--
i
think
one
of
the
problems
is,
of
course,
we
don't
know
for
sure
what
--
what
they
were
thinking,
and
therefore,
it
makes
sense,
i
think,
for
this
court,
in
the
regular
course
of
its
practice,
to
decide
the
question
presented
and
to
send
the
case
back
down
to
the
lower
courts
to--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--whether
title
ix
precludes
the
assertion
of
constitutional
claims
for
gender
discrimination
in
schools
under
section
1983.
the
--
the
--
the
reason
that
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that
that
is
the
language
that
the
first
circuit
used.
the
first
circuit
said,
in
so
many
words,
that
title
ix
is
the
exclusive
avenue
for
the
assertion
of
claims
of
gender
discrimination
arising
out
of
--
arising
from
schools.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
they
were
relying
on
one
case
in
which
the
court
said
that,
in
smith
v.
robinson,
the
only
time
in
140
years
that
section
1983
has
been
on
the
books
that
this
court
has
ever
said
that
congress
meant
to
preclude
its
use
to
enforce
a
particular
constitutional
right.
and
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
--
that's
absolutely
right.
but
i
--
i
--
i
add
parenthetically
that
congress
promptly
responded
to
the
court's
decision
in
smith
by
restoring
the
remedy--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
the
language
used
is
actually
broader
in
the
--
in
the
corrected
legislation.
but
that,
as
i
say,
is
a
parenthetical
point.
i
--
i
think
that
something
that
we
have
here
which
was
not
present
in
smith
at
all
--
and
as
you
say,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
absolutely
right
that
there
was
a
much
more
elaborate,
involved
administrative
remedial
scheme
in
the
statute
considered
there.
there
is
nothing
remotely
like
that
in
title
ix.
but
before
you
even
get
to
that
point,
there
is
this
express
evidence
in
the
statutory
text
of
title
ix
that
congress
did
not
mean
to
preclude
use
of
section
1983.
first,
there
is
the
provision
that
i
mentioned
regarding
the
attorney
general,
which
--
which
expressly
contemplates
there
will
be
continued
section
1983
constitutional
gender
discrimination
after
the
enactment
of
title
ix.
i
think
that
in
and
of
itself
is
dispositive
and
tells
the
court
all
it
needs
to
know.
but
beyond
--
there
is
--
there
is
more.
beyond
that,
there
is
the
language
of
the
antidiscrimination
provision
of
title
ix,
which
was
borrowed
directly,
is
identical
to
the
language
of
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
congress
dropped
the
phrase
"race,
color,
and
national
origin.
"
that
appears
in
title
vi
and
substituted
ix.
and,
so,
the
court
has
recognized
that
congress
expected
and
intended
that
title
ix
would
be
interpreted
just
as
--
as
had
been
title
vi.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
there
--
there
have
been
myriad
such
decisions.
there
have
been
--
as
we
cite
in
our
brief,
as
the
american
bar
association
cites
in
its
amicus
brief
supporting
us,
the
american
civil
liberties
union
cites
in
its
brief
--
there
have
been
almost
two
dozen
cases
decided
before
the
enactment
of
title
ix
in
which
courts
allowed
the
simultaneous
assertion
of
statutory
discrimination
claims
under
title
vi
and
section
1983
discrimination
claims
under
title
ix.
there
had
not
been
a
single
suggestion
by
any
decision
that
there
might
possibly
be
preclusion.
and
so,
at
the
time
that
congress
used
the
language
of
title
ix,
it
knew
that
that
language
had
been
uniformly,
widely
construed
across
the
country
to
allow
the
simultaneous
assertion
of
those
claims,
not
the
preclusion
of
section
1983
claims
for
discrimination.
and
so
it's
when
congress
--
when
legislative
language
has
been
the
subject
of
judicial
construction,
as
the
court
has
said
many
times,
and
congress
repeats
that
language
in
a
new
statute,
its
expectation
and
intention
is
that
the
judicial
construction
is
going
to
be
taken
as
well.
and
so
that
i
think
that
is
also
dispositive
of
the
question
in
this
case,
because
congress
chose
language
that
it
necessarily
knew
had
been
understood
not
to
preclude
the
use
of
section
1983.
and
i
will
mention
as
well,
just
to
sort
of
throw
in
the
suspenders
along
with
the
belt,
an
additional
consideration
that
the
court
of
appeals
ignored
here
was
the
manifest
legislative
purpose
of
section
--
of
title
ix,
which
was
to
expand
and
strengthen
protections
against
discrimination
in
schools.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
absolutely
correct.
and
i
think
that
there
are--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
--
i
think
not,
for
a
couple
of
reasons,
your
honor.
first,
as
i
say,
there
is
this
direct
evidence
of
what
congress
had
in
mind.
it
specifically
referred
to
constitutional
litigation
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
it
enacted
title
ix,
and,
therefore,
by
definition
it
could
not
have
been
concerned
about
evasion
in
that
sense.
but
i
think
that
there
--
ix;
on
the
other,
there
are
pre-existing
constitutional
rights--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the
only
availability
for
individual
liability
is
under
the
constitution,
because
title
ix,
at
least
as
construed
by
the
lower
courts,
does
not
permit
suits
directly
against
the
individual,
only
against
the
institution,
which
i
think
is
a
significant
distinction
between
the
two
and
supports
the
argument
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
preclude
it
because,
as
the
court
has
recognized,
repeatedly,
the
availability
of
individual
liability
greatly
adds
to
the
--
the
deterrence,
the
effect
of
deterring
constitutional
violations.
and
the
suggestion
that,
when
congress
enacted
title
ix,
it
would
have
--
it
meant
to
have
the
perverse
effect
of
allowing
a
school,
by
accepting
federal
funds,
to
insulate
school
policymakers
from
any
personal
statutory
liability,
you
know,
for
even
the
most
blatant
and
obvious
acts
of
unconstitutional
sex
discrimination
would
turn
title
ix
on
its
head.
it's
inconceivable
that
congress
could
have
had
that
intent
in
mind
when
it
enacted
a
statute
that
was
clearly
designed
to
expand
and
strengthen
protections
against
gender
discrimination.
i'll
make
sort
of
two
additional
points,
your
honor.
as
i
--
as
i
suggest,
i
think
the
direct
evidence
in
the
statutory
text,
as
well
as
the
legislative
purpose,
is
dispositive
here
and
the
court
need
not
go
beyond
that
to
answer
the
question
here.
that
leaves
the
question
of
how
the
court
of
appeals
got
the
matter
so
far
wrong.
and
i
think
that
the
reason
that
they
did
is,
ignoring
the
text,
they
applied
what
they
thought
to
be
a
presumption
derived
from
this
court's
decisions
in
cases
like
smith
v.
robinson
and
the
palos
verdes
case
that
the
creation
of
a
new
statutory
right
and
a
new
statutory
remedy
necessarily
reflects
a
congressional
intent
to
preclude
the
use
of
section
1983
to
enforce
overlapping
constitutional
remedies.
there
has
never
been
such
a
presumption.
the
court
has
said
repeatedly,
i
think,
as
was
suggested
earlier
in
the
discussion,
that
when
congress
creates
new
statutory
rights
and
new
statutory
remedies,
they
are
presumed
to
overlap
with
and
to
supplement
existing
statutory
rights
and
remedies,
unless
the
two
are
positively
repugnant
to
one
another,
unless
they
are
inconsistent
and
can't
be
reconciled.
that
certainly
is
not
the
case
here.
the
section
1983
constitutional
claims
and
title
ix
supplement
and
complement
each
other.
the
two
statutes
are
by
no
means
coterminous
in
who
can
be
sued.
the
court
has
certainly
never
presumed
that
the
creation
of
any
statutory
right
or
statutory
remedy
bars
the
use
of
section
1983
to
enforce
the
constitution,
as
suggested
by
justice
ginsburg's
question.
the
court
has
only
once
in
well
more
than
a
century
that
section
1983
has
been
on
the
books
held
that
availability
of
the
constitutional
remedy
had
been
precluded.
as
i
say,
congress
promptly
responded
by
providing
that
remedy.
the
palos
verdes
decision,
which
was
the
fulcrum
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
i
think
suggests
what's
wrong
with
its
analysis.
palos
verdes
involved
a
new
statutory
right,
a
new
statutory
action
to
enforce
that
right.
the
statutory
action
was
limited
in
significant
respects,
and
the
court
concluded,
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
that
one
could
infer
from
that
situation
congress
intended
that
the
new
right
--
with
the
new
remedial
system
would
be
exclusive,
otherwise
plaintiffs
could
immediately
go
to
court
and
render
that
system
a
dead
letter.
but,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
for
the
court,
that
holding
had
no
effect
whatsoever
on
section
1983.
it
meant
that
congress
had
placed
the
new
remedy
outside
of
section
1983's
remedial
framework,
but
that
claims
that
were
available
prior
to
the
existence
of
that
new
right,
prior
to
the
creation
of
that
new
right,
remained
available
under
section
1983.
and
that
is
exactly
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
plaintiffs
are
not
trying
to
allege
a
new
statutory
right
that
is
outside
the
section
1983's
remedial
framework;
instead,
they
are
asserting
fundamental,
pre-existing
constitutional
rights.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that
to
the
extent
--
as
was
suggested
by
justice
ginsburg's
line
of
questioning,
to
the
extent
that
the
claims
are
the
same,
then
they
would
preclude
it,
the
1983
claim,
if
it
has
the
same
elements,
if
it's
the
same
cause
of
action--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--there
would
be
issue
--
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think,
to
the
extent
that
the
suit
was
initially
brought
against
the
school
under
title
ix
for
a
type
of
claim
that
could
have
been
brought
as
a
parallel
claim
against
the
individual
under
section
1983,
and
the
title
ix
claim
was
rejected,
to
the
extent
that
the
elements
are
the
same,
presumably
there
would
be
a
defensive
claim
of
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
exactly
correct.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--thank
you.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
your
honor.
and
i'll
try
not
to
use
my
extra
10
seconds.
two
principal
points:
first,
on
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case,
the
first
circuit's
holding
--
and
i'm
reading
from
page
24a
of
the
petition
appendix:
"the
comprehensiveness
of
title
ix's
remedial
scheme.
"
"indicates
congress
saw
title
ix
as
the
sole
means
of
vindicating
the
constitutional
right
to
be
free
from
gender
discrimination
perpetrated
by
educational
institutions.
"
"it
follows
that
the
plaintiffs'
equal
protection
claims
are
precluded.
"
that
was
not
a
holding
that
had
to
do
with
claim
preclusion,
issue
preclusion,
collateral
estoppel;
it
was
a
holding
that
constitutional
claims
simply
cannot
go
forward.
so
there
are
constitutional
claims
that
were
advanced
below,
argued
to
both
courts,
have
not
been
discussed
by
any
court
at
any
point,
and
i
think
the
proper
disposition
here
--
the
most
regular
course
in
a
case
of
this
sort
to
is
decide
the
question
presented,
send
the
case
back.
it
certainly
is
not
the
case
--
it's
a
commonplace
that
the
court
has
threshold
questions
that
are
presented
to
it.
there
are
remaining
issues
that
have
to
be
resolved
on
--
on
remand.
it's
certainly
not
the
court's
usual
practice
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
plaintiffs
can
--
can
prevail
on
those
claims
on
remand
before
deciding
the
threshold
questions
on
which
cert
was
granted.
i
think
that's
the
appropriate
approach
for
the
court
to
take
here.
on
the
merits,
very
quickly.
again,
i
think
we
have
here
the
gold
standard
of
evidence
as
to
preclusion.
we
have
express
statutory
text
that
deals
with
it.
my
learned
colleague
suggested
that
the
attorney
general
intervention
provision
was
somehow
limited
to
cases
involving
claims
by
schools
that
don't
accept
federal
funds
or
somehow
are
not
subject
to
title
ix.
that
is
not
the
language
of
the
provision.
the
provision
says
whenever
--
whenever
a
claim
is
initiated
in
a
court
of
the
united
states
asserting
deprivation
of
rights,
equal
protection
on
account
of
sex,
the
attorney
general
can
intervene.
clearly,
congress
had
it
in
mind
that
there
would
be
such
claims.
and
this
was
enacted
as
part
of
title
ix.
this
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
statute
that
creates
rights
against
discrimination
by
schools
receiving
federal
funds.
it
makes
no
sense
to
suggest
that
congress--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no.
no.
it
is--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
true,
but
i
think
it
answers
the
preclusion
question
because
it
suggests
that
congress
has
it
in
mind
that
there
would
in
fact
be
section
1983
constitutional
litigation
involving
gender
discrimination.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
they
said
whenever
there
is
a
claim
of
unconstitutional
gender
discrimination.
i
think
it's
a
blanket
suggestion
congress
believes
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
am
suggesting
that
the
language
says
that
whenever
a
claim
of
gender
discrimination
is
advanced
under
the
constitution,
the
attorney
general
can
intervene.
i
think
what
we
draw
from
that
is
that
congress
imagined
that
there
would
be
continued
constitutional
litigation
involving
gender
discrimination
after
they
enacted
title
ix.
and
because
that
provision
was
added
to
the
law
as
part
of
title
ix,
congress
surely
contemplated
that
these
suits
would
involve
gender
discrimination
involving
schools.
the
other
sort
of
clear
textual
indication
which
i
--
again,
my
learned
colleague
has
not
really
discussed,
is
the
title
vi
history
of
enforcement
prior
to
the
enactment
of
title
ix,
which
was
absolutely
consistent.
there
are
almost
two
such
dozen
decisions,
which,
this
court
suggested
in
cannon,
it
is
not
only
appropriate
but
realistic
to
think
that
congress
was
aware
of
at
the
time
it
enacted
title
ix.
those
decisions
clearly
indicated
that
there
was
no
preclusion.
the
language
of
title
vi
and
title
ix
is
identical.
there
can
be
no
doubt,
i
think,
that
congress
would
have
had
it
in
mind
that
preclusion
is
not
appropriate
in
this
context
as
well.
and
one
final,
very
quick
point.
this
is
an
implied
right
of
action;
to
suggest
that
congress
meant
to
preclude
the
use
of
the
constitution
to
enforce
the
--
preclude
section
1983
to
enforce
the
constitution
while
leaving
it
to
the
courts
to
imply
the
alternative
remedy
and
to
devise
the
contours
on
and
the
limitations
on
that
remedy,
would
require
--
hypothesize
a
remarkable
leap
of
faith
on
the
part
of
congress.
it
also
would
require
the
most
extravagant
and
speculative
reading
of
title
ix,
to
understand
it
to
not
only
to
include
private
rights
of
action
but
to
preclude
the
assertion
of
express
rights
of
action
created
by
congress
by
language
in
another
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor.
