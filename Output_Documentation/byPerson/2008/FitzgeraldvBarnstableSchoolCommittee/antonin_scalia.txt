justice
antonin
scalia
that's
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
can't
see
you.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
question
ought
to
be
whether
this
court
intended
to
have
the
title
ix
action,
which
it
invented,
preclude
1983.
why
don't
we
look
to
the
intent
of
this
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rothfeld,
we
were
--
we
were
warned
about
all
these
problems
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
weren't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
that
focus
almost
entirely
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
no
1983
cause
of
action
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
nonetheless
granted
--
granted
cert?
justice
antonin
scalia
yet
the
other
side
says
that
there
may
be,
and
i
don't
know
why
we
ought
to
get
into
that.
why
can't
we
just
send
it
back
and
let
them
figure
that
out?
and
--
and
--
and
decide
what
we
took
this
case
to
decide,
namely,
the
split
that
now
exists
in
the
federal
courts
over
whether
title
ix
precludes
the
use
of
1983.
that's
an
important
question.
it's
why
we
took
the
case.
why
can't
we
decide
that
issue
and
then
for
all
these
loose
ends,
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
says
there
is
an
issue
in
controversy.
that's
good
enough
for
me.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
cover
the
situation
in
which
a
plaintiff
says,
i
don't
want
to
proceed
under
title
ix;
i
want
to
proceed
first
under
1983.
then
there
is
going
to
be
no
question
about
whether
1983
is
--
is
unavailable
because
of
issue
preclusion.
he
is
starting
with
1983.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your
position
on
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
can't
proceed
under
1983.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
disagreeing.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
disagreeing.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
does
that
provision
apply
only
when
there
is
a
title
ix
cause
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
well,
if
it
doesn't,
then
it
--
then
it
has
validity
whether
or
not
you
agree
with
your
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
maybe
they
thought
only
in
cases
where
there
is
no
title
ix
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you
don't
think
they
mean
whether
there's
a
--
there's
a
valid
claim?
even
when
there
is
a
claim
that
isn't
allowed
under
the
law?
