justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
second
opinion
is
in
fitzgerald
versus
barnstable
school
committee
07-1125.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
first
circuit.
petitioners
sued
the
local
school
board
and
the
superintendent
alleging
that
the
school's
response
to
allegations
of
peer-on-peer
sexual
harassment
against
their
daughter
was
inappropriate.
among
others
they
raised
claims
under
title
ix
of
the
education
amendments
of
1972
and
42
u.s.c
section
1983.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
1983
claims
were
precluded
by
title
ix
and
affirmed
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
those
claims.
for
reason
set
out
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceeding
particularly
in
light
of
the
nature
of
the
title
ix
remedial
scheme.
we
hold
that
there
is
insufficient
evidence
that
congress
meant
to
preclude
petitioners'
1983
claims.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
