chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-1125,
fitzgerald
v.
barnstable
school
committee.
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
there's
--
there's
a
little
bit
of
an
air
of
unreality
about
all
this,
because,
of
course,
congress
didn't
provide
a
cause
of
action
in
title
ix
to
start
with.
and
the
reason
they
don't
have
all
these
limitations
and
restrictions
is
because
they
didn't
put
in
the
cause
of
action.
we
implied
it
from
the
statute,
and
so
it
seems
kind
of
awkward
to
say,
well,
there
are
no
limitations,
as
i
said,
when
there
was
no
cause
of
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
we
rely
on
that
provision
in
implying
the
right
of
action
under
title
ix?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
give
you
an
extra
10
seconds.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
of
course,
title
ix
is
spending
clause
legislation,
and
that,
under
our
precedents,
imposes
certain
limitations
on
how
we
interpret
it
that
would
not
be
applicable
under
section
1983.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
point
is
that
that
would
then
allow
1983
actions
to
circumvent
those
limitations
on
the
title
ix
remedy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
take
it
they
don't
have
to
bring
these
actions
together.
they
can
sue
under
title
ix;
if
they
lose,
then
they
can
start
a
whole
new
lawsuit
under
1983?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
you
have
different
--
i
guess
you
would
have
a
different
set
of
defendants,
right?
you
would
have
the
school
in
the
title
ix
case,
the
individuals
in
the
1983
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
hodge,
we
will
hear
from
you
on
behalf
of
the
barnstable
school
committee.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
not
arguing
that
the
agency
regulations
have
the
effect
of
precluding
a
1983
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt.
so
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
they're
right,
that
1983
actions
are
not
always
precluded,
depending
upon
whether
there's
a
difference
in
the
issues
that
are
presented
or
whatever.
so
you
should
never
say
that
title
ix
precludes
an
action
under
1983.
in
fact,
you
should
say
that
sometimes
the
issues
that
are
litigated
under
title
ix
may
result
in
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
available
--
you
don't
get
relief
under
1983,
but
there
is
still
a
cause
of
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
kind
of
odd
to
say
that
--
as
i
understand
what
you
are
saying,
you
are
saying
whenever
there
is
issue
preclusion,
a
consequence
is
that
1983
is
precluded
in
the
sense
that
actions
were
precluded
in
smith.
well,
why
don't
--
i
guess
i'm
--
maybe
i
am
repeating
the
question.
why
do
we
have
to
decide
that?
and
we
would
just
say
there
is
a
1983
action,
but
you
may
not
be
able
to
pursue
it,
i
guess
is
the
way
to
put
it,
if
your
claims
are
precluded
or
the
issues
result
in
the
fact
that
you
don't
recover.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
because
we're
still
in
the
business
of
implying
rights
of
action
under
bivens.
it's
different
to
say
--
you
know,
if
you
say
we
are
implying
it,
but
as
soon
as
congress
does
something,
we
are
not
going
to
do
that.
that's
quite
different
than
construing
a
provision,
like
1983,
that
congress
has
enacted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
hodge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
rothfeld,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
mr.
rothfeld,
we
apologize
for
the
malfunction,
we'll
fix
it.
