justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
could
you
have
brought
a
claim
that
they
didn't
let
the
female
students
play
hockey,
under
your
complaint?
i
mean,
that's
additional
discrimination.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
didn't
it
have
to
be
related
to
the
particular
facts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
is
there
--
and
you
talked
about
you
wanted
some
additional
discovery.
what?
what
is
it
that
you
could
go
to
a
district
judge
now
and
say,
judge,
i
have
a
basis
here
for
asking
for
discovery
on
a
different
but
related
theory?
what
words
would
you
use?
what
would
you
write
in
that
request?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
i
ask
is
obviously
if
this
case
happens
to
be
a
case
in
which,
because
of
the
finding
that
there
was
no
intentional
discrimination
and
the
school
board
behaved
properly,
that
if
that's
the
finding
and
therefore
you
have
no
claim
under
1983
in
respect
to
that,
it
becomes
very
theoretical
to
say
that
they
went
too
far
and
said
you
might
have
no
other
1983
claim
because
you
would
have
some
other
1983
claim,
but
we
should
dismiss
this
as
improvidently
granted
and
wait
until
somebody
does
this
again.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
request
here
in
the
record?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
request
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
i
have
the
request
in
the
joint
--
in
the
--
do
i
have
it
in
the
appendix
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
we
don't
even
have
it
in
front
of
us?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
know
that
the
first
circuit
wasn't
just
thinking
about
the
facts
of
this
case
in
front
of
it
when
it
said
that
there's
no
1983
action.
i
mean,
they
didn't
think
there
was
no
1983
action
for
search
and
seizure.
they
must
have
had
some
idea
of
what
the
limitations
of
their
saying
no
--
no
--
no
1983
action
was.
so
why
do
we
know
that
they
went
beyond
what
they
had
in
front
of
them
in
this
case?
i'm
not
saying
they
didn't.
i
am
just
wanting
to
know
what
we
--
how
we
know
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
see,
the
question
presented,
i
guess
is
--
i'm
trying
to
get
the
exact
words,
but
it's
whether
the
title
ix
replaces
the
--
what
is
it,
it's
whether
--
i'm
sorry.
you
have
it
right
in
front
of
you
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
they're
--
they're
referring
to
all
of
title
ix,
no
matter
what
the
claims,
whether
they
are
overlapping
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
saying
--
is
this
what
you
are
saying:
we
imagine
that
we
have
a
institution
that
is
receiving
federal
assistance,
okay?
and
we
also
imagine
that
somebody
is
claiming
that,
on
the
basis
of
gender,
they
have
been
excluded
from
participating
in,
or
denied
the
benefit
of,
or
subject
to
discrimination.
are
you
saying
that
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
to
imagine
a
circumstance
in
which
it
would
be
held
the
defendant
did
not
violate
title
ix,
but
in
which
the
court
held
it
did
violate
the
equal
protection
clause?
there
is
no
such
circumstance;
no
one
can
imagine
one.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
cannot
imagine
one.
you
think
no
one
can
imagine
one.
so
an
obvious
question
on
rebuttal
is,
since
we
have
limited
it
to
that
universe,
would
be
the
other
side
must
imagine
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
simple.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
a
disparate-impact
claim
violate
section
--
title
ix?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
an
individual,
under
title
ix
you
can't
bring
the
suit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
you
could
under
1983?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
point
then
is
--
and
that's
why
i've
had
trouble
with
this
case
--
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
first
circuit
opinion,
it
sort
of
seems
to
say:
if
there's
a
difference,
of
course
you
can
have
a
1983
suit,
but
if
there's
no
difference,
you
can't.
i
mean,
everybody
here
seems
to
agree
to
that,
i
guess.
so
i'm
not
certain
what
to
do,
because
selya
started
his
opinion
by
saying
this
isn't
a
case
where
title
ix
doesn't
apply;
it
does
apply;
they
have
the
funding;
but
he
doesn't
talk
about
the
exemptions
and
he
doesn't
really
talk
about
the
--
a
difference
between
suing
an
institution
and
suing
an
individual.
so
maybe
what
we
should
say
is,
maybe
he
meant
it,
but
he
didn't
say
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
are
saying
if
it's
an
individual
acting
in
his
official
capacity,
you
cannot
sue
him
under
title
ix?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
their
answer
to
that
which
--
say,
look,
we
want
to
sue
an
individual
in
his
official
capacity;
that's
why
we
want
to
bring
our
1983
suit.
and
then
you
reply:
but
there
are
bars
here
of
collateral
estoppel,
claim
preclusion
--
whatever
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
all
have
new
names.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
--
the
--
okay.
that's
your
argument.
so
why
don't
we
just
send
it
back,
say
that's
right;
this
suit
is
not
precluded
by
1983;
indeed,
that's
the
only
place
you
can
bring
it;
it's
not
precluded
by
title
ix,
and
now,
court,
you
go
decide
whether
claim
preclusion
exists,
or
whatever
you
call
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--collateral
estoppel,
or
--
you
understand
what
i
mean.
