justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nogales
was
doing
great?
i
mean,
i
asked
my
clerk
to
go
get
some
figures
out
of
the
record
and
she
says
in
2008
in
the
sixth
grade,
just
to
take
an
example,
77
percent
of
the
english
learners
in
nogales
failed
the
tests
as
compared
to
32
percent
statewide.
in
the
tenth
grade
84
percent
failed
the
reading
exam
compared
with
34
percent
statewide.
in
2008
the
reading
exam
fourth
graders,
67
percent
failed
in
nogales,
the
english
learners,
compared
to
30
percent
statewide.
now,
i'm
sure
that
progress
has
been
made,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me,
looking
at
that
kind
of
thing
--
and
the
record
is
filled
with
that
kind
of
thing
--
that
that
--
that
you
could
say
that
the
objectives
are
achieved.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
isn't
the
point
of
this
to
teach
the
children
to
learn
english?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
doesn't
actually
have
the
right
to
ask
me
questions.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
let's
take
the
one
you
mentioned.
let's
take
the
one
you
mention.
the
one
you
mentioned,
i
take
it
the
student
academic
achievement
in
mathematics,
which
is
something
called
the
ayp
guidelines
test,
they
are
for
high
school,
which
you
mentioned.
it
has
--
i
think
it's
2008,
maybe
it's
2007
--
we
have
limited
english
proficient
students,
this
is
passing
their
test,
22.4
percent
of
the
english
learners
are
at
students
scoring
at
or
above
proficient.
the
overall
rate
is
68
percent.
so
it
seems
like
about
a
third.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
reading
language
arts,
the
average
is
73.5.
limited
english
proficient
is
15.4.
and
that's
quite
a
difference,
75
percent
as
to
15.4,
in
the
high
schools,
on
the
tests
that
you
have
mentioned.
so
i
just
say
--
my
only
point
is
that
we
have
a
couple
of
findings
here;
you
are
right,
they
have
made
progress,
but
they
are
not
quite
home
yet.
and
i
would
say
that,
looking
at
this
record,
it
seems
to
suggest
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
do
another
one.
what
they
started
out
in
the
year
2000
is
they
said
one
problem
with
this
state
is
we
don't
know
what
it
costs
the
average
--
the
increased
program.
they
haven't
done
a
good
study
to
tell
what
it
costs.
but
we
think
it's
somewhere
around
$1500,
maybe
it's
$1300,
maybe
it's
$1400
per
student.
and
as
of
this
very
moment,
the
state
is
providing
3
to
$400,
leaving
it
up
to
the
school
district
to
find
the
rest
of
the
money,
which
it
has
to
take
from
other
things
like
english,
or
--
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
one
state
funding?
because
i
looked
at
your
brief,
page
22
to
23,
and
if
i
understand
it
correctly
it
says
that
the
educational
expenditures,
that
is
to
say
monies,
increased
in
this
nogales
and
usd--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--maintenance
and
operation
budget,
by
30
percent.
well,
i'm
sure
they
did.
but
that's
i
take
it
the
entire
maintenance
and
operation
budget.
the
numbers
i
had
--
and
i
am
quite
interested
to
know
if
they
are
wrong
--
the
numbers
that
i
have
is
that
the
only
survey
they've
done
across
the
state,
or
the
most
recent
one,
says
that
the
english
language
instructional
costs
range
between
1570
and
$3300
per
pupil.
and
then
if
you
look
at
the
amount
the
state
provides
outside
of
the
reading,
writing
and
arithmetic,
which
they
provide,
et
cetera,
for
all
students,
what
they
provide
is
--
currently
it's
$340,
and
if
that
law
had
gone
into
effect,
2064,
it
would
have
been
$450.
now,
are
those
numbers
totally
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
a
minor
thing
that
i
--
i
think
--
i'm
not
sure
that
justice
ginsburg
said.
i
thought
that
the
funding
order
was
not
fund
the
plan
you
come
up
with;
but
rather,
come
up
with
a
funding
plan
that
bears
a
rational
relationship
to
--
to
the
plan
you
come
up
with.
so
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
now
the
district
court
is
at
considerable
remove.
he
says
they
have
not
yet
come
up
with
a
study
and
a
plan
that
seems
satisfactory,
and
they
haven't
shown
how
the
funding
is
rational
in
relation
to
the
plan
that
they
haven't
fully
developed,
though
they've
made
progress.
that's
where
we
are
--
is
that
where
we
are?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
justice
stevens,
justice
souter,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
are
dissenting.
our
reasons
are
contained
in
a
pretty
long
opinion.
and
that
opinion
for
the
most
part
describes
a
much
longer
record.
and
i'm
saying
something
else
simply
because
i
want
to
call
attention
to
three
aspects
of
the
case
which
as
justice
alito
says,
it
is
about
the
rights
of
non-english
speaking
students
to
receive
english
language
instruction
guaranteed
to
them
by
federal
statute,
the
equal
educational
opportunities
act.
first,
we're
afraid
that
the
court
has
set
forth
new
standards
for
reviewing
decisions
in
what
it
calls
in
its
opinion,
institutional
reform
litigation
or
at
least,
it's
applied
old
standards
in
new
ways.
in
either
way,
we're
concerned
that
the
court's
approach
will
make
it
more
difficult
for
federal
courts
to
enforce
federal
law
that
sets
for
standard
for
example
in
respect
to
education
that
congress
has
required
state
systems
to
meet.
second,
we
readily
strongly
disagree
with
the
court's
own
reading
of
the
record
and
that
record
in
our
view,
it
contains
numerous
fact
findings,
their
findings
are
based
pretty
much
on
the
facts
here,
that
in
our
opinion,
more
than
adequately
--
more
than
adequately
support
lower
courts
conclusions.
and
then
third,
the
fact
that
our
differences
here
do
concern
lower
court
findings
about
matters
of
fact
does
not
make
the
differences
among
the
members
of
the
court
and
neither
less
important.
for
courts
to
decide
whether
individuals
receive
the
rights
to
which
the
law
entitles
them,
more
often
raises
questions
of
fact
than
it
raises
grand
or
sounding
questions
of
legal
interpretation.
and
here,
we
believe
that
the
courts
--
what
we
think
is
a
mistaken
interpretation
of
the
lower
courts'
fact-based
conclusions
mean
that
spanish
speaking
students
attending
the
public
schools
in
nogales,
arizona
will
find
it
significantly
more
difficult
to
receive
an
equal
education
which
in
part
teaches
them
to
read
and
to
write
in
english
and
that
is
an
education
to
which
the
law
entitles
them.
because
i
think
the
matter
is
important,
i've
written
a
pretty
great
length
about
the
details
of
this
fact
related
case
and
i
explained
all
these
more
in
a
48-page
dissent
which
as
i
said,
justice
stevens,
justice
souter,
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
