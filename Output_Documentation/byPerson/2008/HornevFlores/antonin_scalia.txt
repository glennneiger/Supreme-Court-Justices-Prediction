justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
am
not
following
this
exchange
because
i
don't
understand
whether
the
--
the
statewide
percentage
is
the
statewide
percentage
of
english
learners
or
the
statewide
percentage
of
all
students.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
can't
answer
that,
i
think
justice
breyer
can.
but
i
would
like
to
know
what
comparison--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't.
that's
--
that's
exactly
true.
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
assume
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
also
assume
the
state
law
does
not
require
that
any
--
any
judicial
decree
with
respect
to
a
particular
district
be
expanded
to
the
whole
state.
it
seems
to
me
you
could
comply
with
the
state
constitution.
if
and
when
a
judgment
is
rendered
as
to
the
district,
it
would
then
be,
under
the
state
constitution,
the
responsibility
of
the
state
executive
to
make
sure
that
the
other
--
other
districts
are
equalized.
but
why
the
attorney
general
had
to
come
into
the
federal
court
and
say,
do
it
to
the
whole
state,
because
the
whole
state
has
to
be
equal,
i
--
i
can't
understand
that,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
fact
is
he
wanted
to
be
thrown
into
the
briar
patch,
didn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
attorney
general
wanted
the
decree.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
didn't
--
didn't
the
court
--
you
say
plan
a
is
no
longer
in
effect;
they
have
a
new
plan
under
the
no
child
left
behind
act.
but
didn't
the
--
didn't
the
district
court
find
that
the
funding
for
that
plan
is
inadequate,
for
the
two
reasons
that
were
mentioned
earlier?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
--
i
agree
with
that.
i
think
it
was
a
vast
mistake
to
extend
a
lawsuit
that
applied
only
to
nogales
to
the
whole
state,
but
the
state
attorney
general
wanted
that
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
--
that's
water
over
the
dam.
that's
not
what
this
suit
is
about
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
would
be
good
enough
to
fix
nogales.
so
you
are
quite
right.
there
is
a
vast
difference
in
each
district.
but
that
attorney
general
wanted
enough
money
to
fund
the
whole
state
the
way
you
have
to
fund
to
--
to
fix
nogales.
that's
what
he
wanted.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
whether
the
requirements
of
the
eeoa
are
at
all
affected
by
congress's
later
enactment
of
the
no
child
left
behind
act?
i
mean,
you
know,
it's
a
very
vague
requirement
that
you
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
--
to
provide
language
assistance
to
children.
why
shouldn't
the
courts
decide
that
what
constitutes
a
good
faith
effort
is
pretty
much
what
congress
thought
was
necessary
in
the
--
in
the
no
child
left
behind
act,
and
if
you
comply
with
that,
you
are
doing
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i
would
call
that
good
faith,
but
that's
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
page
is
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
degree--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
degree
of
improvement
do
you
think
is
necessary?
do
you
agree
with
the
ninth
--
the
ninth
circuit
says,
"we
cannot
say
the
district
court
clearly
erred
when
it
found
this
burden
was
not
met.
"
"a
district
in
which
the
majority
of
ell
tenth
graders
failed
to
meet
state
achievement
standards
while
the
majority
of
native
english
speakers
passed
is
not
one
whose
performance
demonstrates
that
the
state
is
adequately
funding
ell
programs.
"
do
you
really
think
that
you
haven't
complied
with
adequate
funding
of
ell
programs
until
you
raise
all
of
the
ell
students
up
to
the
level
of
native
english
speakers?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
all
this
says.
the
majority
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--doesn't
meet
the
--
a
majority
of
ell
tenth
graders
fail
to
meet
the
standards,
but
the
majority
of
native
english
speakers
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
find
it
bizarre
that
we
are
sitting
here
talking
about
what
the
whole
state
has
to
do
on
the
basis
of
one
district
which
is
concededly
the
district
that
has
the
most
nonnative
english
speakers
and
has
been
a
problem
district
all
along.
and
we
are
saying
whatever
this
district
court
says
for
--
for
this
school
district
applies
statewide.
now,
that
is
bizarre.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
state
attorney
general
acquiesced
in
that
kind
--
kind
of
a
system
at
the
outset,
does
that
force
us
to
still
accept
at
this
time
that
whatever
is
--
is
necessary
for
nogales
is
also
necessary
for
the
entire
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
let--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'll
let
arizona
worry
about
that.
it's
--
it's
another
matter
to
have
a
district
court
decree
that
the
whole
state
has
to
do
this
thing.
and
whether
--
whether
it's
done
equally
or
not
would
be
a
matter
for
the
state
courts
to
determine,
instead
of
for
this
district
judge
to
determine,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
understand
that.
you
could
get
the
plan
approved
and
then
not
fund
it.
but
at
least
the
additional
funding
demanded
by
the
district
court
should
be
whatever
additional
funding
is
necessary
to
comply
with
the
no
child
left
behind
act.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
--
then
it's
not
as
simple
as
you
made
it.
of
course,
i
agree
with
the
fact
that
if
you
get
approved
under
the
no
child
left
behind
act
and
then
don't
fund
it,
of
course
that
--
that
won't
satisfy
your
obligation.
but
if
you
have
gotten
approved,
the
test
for
whether
you
are
satisfying
your
obligation
should
be
how
much
money
would
it
cost
to
implement
the
program
that
you
have
gotten
approved
under
the
no
child
left
behind
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
approve
programs?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
states
had
to
submit
a
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
saying
you
can't
calculate
costs.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
cannot
calculate
costs
under
the
plan
approved
by
the
secretary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
all
the
plan
is
is
testing.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
saharsky,
i
have
one
late
arriving
question.
do
you
think
that
the
constitutional
--
state
constitutional
provision
at
least
there
has
to
be
equivalent
funding
in
districts,
do
you
think
that
would
be
called
into
play
if
the
federal
government
under
a
federal
program
gave
additional
funds
to
a
particular
district?
which
i
am
sure
it
does,
those
districts
that
have
federal
facilities
probably
get
additional
--
additional
money,
would
all
the
rest
--
under
this
constitutional
provision,
would
all
the
rest
of
the
state
have
to
belly
up
to
that
--
to
that
same
level?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
doubt
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
federal
funding
doesn't
count,
why
would
a
federal
decree
applicable
only
to
a
particular
school
district
count?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
no
content
to
the
equal
child
--
no
child
left
behind.
there
is
no
content
to
it.
all
it
requires
is
testing.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
say
how
much
it's
going
to
cost.
