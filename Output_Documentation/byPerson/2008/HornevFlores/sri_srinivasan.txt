mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
district
court
issued
its
initial
judgment
in
2000,
what
the
court
found
was
that
there
was
a
systemic
violation
of
the
eeoa.
and
the
court
further
found
that
the
program
deficiencies
were
the
result
of
the
lack
of
funding
rationally
related
to
the
programs.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
justice
scalia,
just
one
point
of
clarification
on
--
in
our
view
on
what
the
eeoa
requires,
and
then
i
will
address
the
no
child
left
behind
point.
the
eeoa
doesn't
really
require
good
faith
efforts.
it
requires
efforts
that
are
in
fact
reasonably
calculated
to
overcome
language
barriers.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
with
that
--
with
that
clarification,
thank
you.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
with
that
clarification
on
the
question
of
whether
no
child
left
behind
sets
the
standard
for
compliance
with
the
eeoa,
which
is,
i
think,
what
the
petitioners'
position
is,
we
think
the
answer
is
no
for
two
fundamental
reasons.
first
is
just
a
textual
point.
the
text
of
no
child
left
behind
doesn't
say
anywhere
that
it
displaces
the
standards
for
compliance
with
the
eeoa.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
think
their
argument
at
the
end
of
the
day,
justice
alito,
is
that
if
you
comply
with
no
child
left
behind
--
and
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment
what
compliance
with
no
child
left
behind
can
mean
--
then
you
have
necessarily
complied
with
the
eeoa.
that
compliance
with
the
no
child
left
behind
sets
the
standard
for
compliance
with
the
eeoa.
and
i
don't
think
that
is
workable
particularly
when
you
take
into
account
what
petitioners
mean
by
"compliance
with
no
child
left
behind.
"
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
that
that
is
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
eeoa.
what
we
would
say
is
that
if
the
state
came
forward
with
a
showing
that
completely
regardless
of
funding
the
programs
on
the
ground
work,
well,
that
would
be
something
that
the
district
court
would
have
to
take
into
account.
but
the
state
hasn't--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--the
ninth
circuit
focused
on
funding,
justice
alito,
because
that
is
the
way
the
case
has
been
litigated
from
the
outset.
and
that's
the
way
the
state
has
said
from
the
outset
that
it
would
achieve
compliance
with
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
was
--
was
required
certainly
to
review
the
district
court's
inquiry
into
that.
and
what
the
district
court
found
is
at
page
100-a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
filed
by
the
legislative
intervenors.
and
what
the
district
court
found
there
is
that
the
improvements
today,
although
significant,
failed
to
reach
the
high
school;
that
they
were
fleeting.
and
--
and
this
is
particularly
significant.
in
addition,
the
district
court
also
explained
that
it
was
premature
to
make
an
assessment
of
many
of
the
changes,
because
many
of
the
new
standards
are
still
evolving.
and
the
reason
the
district
court
said
that
is
that
--
is
because
of
the
enactment
in
2006
of
arizona
hb
2064,
which
changes
the
framework
for
administration
and
funding
of
ell
programs
in
a
way
that
i
think
fortifies
the
district
court's
denial
of
complete
dissolution
of
its
judgment
and
--
and
ensuing
orders.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes,
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that,
and
it
should
be
looked
at.
and
the
district
court
did
look
at
it,
and
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
the
claims
of
progress,
although
there
had
been
progress,
the
progress
hadn't
reached
the
high
school.
the
progress
was
fleeting
and
that
it
was
premature--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
the
district
court
didn't
issue
that
sort
of
order.
and
--
and
the
ninth
circuit
--
if
you
look
at
page
66a
--
it
did
review
the
evidence
in
the
record
and
fortified
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
the
new
plan,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
was
presented,
which
is
to
the
effect
that,
regardless
of
funding,
we
have
made
advances
based
on
management
improvements
that
should
satisfy
the
statute.
that
was
the
claim
that
was
made
by
petitioners.
i
think
that's
what
you're
alluding
to.
and
the
district
court
rejected
that
at
page
100a,
and
the
ninth
circuit
fortified
the
district
court's
rejection
of
it
by
looking
at
the
evidence
in
the
record
concerning--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it's
at
66a.
that
the
court
of
appeals
reviews
the
testimony
and
fortifies
the
district
court's
conclusion
that,
based
on
the
advances
to
date,
there's
still
work
left
to
be
done.
because
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
have
to
have
a
plan
in
place.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
there's
two
fundamentally
different
assertions
being
made
by
petitioners,
if
i
understand
it:
one
is
what
justice
scalia
alluded
to
earlier,
which
is
that
no
child
left
behind
changed
the
legal
landscape
in
a
way
such
that
compliance
with
no
child
left
behind,
such
as
it
is,
sets
the
standard
for
compliance
with
the
eeoa.
now,
there's
a
distinct
argument
that's
also
being
made
which
is
that
conditions
on
the
ground
have
improved
as
a
consequence
of
management
improvements.
regardless
of
no
child
left
behind,
this
is
a
factual
argument,
that
factually
things
have
changed
in
a
way
that
ought
to
let
us
from
underneath
the
district
court's
supervision.
now,
the
--
they
are
different
points,
and
i
think
the
district
court
addressed
both
of
them.
with
respect
to
the
second
one,
where
there
is
the
facts
on
the
ground,
what
is
critical
is
that,
in
order
to
justify
complete
dissolution
in
a
case
like
this,
the
petitioners
would
have
to
show,
not
only
that
conditions
have
improved,
but
they
have
improved
in
a
way
that
is
durable
and
sustainable
over
time.
and
the
district
court--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--doubted
that.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
i
don't
think
the
eeoa
requires
raising
everyone.
i
think
it
requires--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
that's
part
of
what
it
says,
and
i
think
what
the
ninth
circuit
is
also
alluding
to
with
respect
to
the
high
school
in
particular
that,
if
you
look
at
state
survey
that
petitioners
rely
on
in
--
in
touting
the
improvements
in
certain
schools,
it
also
with
respect
to
the
high
school
shows
that
the
two
high
schools
in
nogales
was
ranked
--
were
ranked
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
survey
for
ell
students.
so
there's
problems
on
the
ground,
but
what
the
district
court
focused
on
concerns
the
enactment
of
2064,
which
is
that
no
matter
was
think
about
the
improvements
that
have
--
that
have
been
made
to
date,
the
landscape
fundamentally
shifts
upon
the
enactment
of
2064
because
the
administration
and
funding
of
ell
plans
changes
at
that
point.
and
it's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
--
i
think
we
would
agree
because
that
sets
the
charter
for
provision
of
programs
to
ell
students
going
forward
from
its
enactment.
that's
the
infrastructure
from
--
from
here
on
out.
and
that
--
there's
three
particular
features
of
that
that
i
think
are
significant
and
that
fortify
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
complete
dissolution
was
unwarranted.
the
first
is
the
one
that
was
raised
by
justice
souter,
which
is
that
whatever
you
think
of
the
progress
that
has
been
made
to
date
--
and
the
district
court
found
that,
while
it
was
significant,
it
didn't
suffice
--
that
changes
from
what
can
be
brought
to
bear
from
here
on
out
as
half
the
resources
that
were
available
before,
because
that's
the
net
effect
of
2064.
that's
what
the
district
court
found,
at
pages
107
to
108a
of
the
petition
appendix.
and
when
you
have
half
resources
to
work
with
--
at
the
very
least
i
think
what
the
district
court
thought
in
saying
that
it
was
premature
to
make
an
assessment
is
that
we
have
to
have
some
period
to
assess
what
happens
on
the
ground
as
a
consequence--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--of
this
new
funding
recipe.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
the
--
the
district
--
the
state
would
have
to
present
that,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
believe
the
state
to
have
done
that
so
far.
but
the
state
would
have
to
make
the
argument
that
funding
constraints
are
inexistence
in
a
way
that
doesn't
allow
us
to
--
to
use
one
example
--
to
--
to
put
together
an
optimal
program,
and
so
here's
the
program
that
we
want
to
put
in
place
in--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--jurisdictions.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that
that
issue
becomes
largely
an
academic
one
for
the
following
reason:
that
the
reason
that
the
state
attorney
general
made
the
acknowledgment
that
he
did
is
that,
under
the
arizona
state
constitution,
funding
decisions
don't
vary
from
district
to
district.
so
whatever
funding
menu
is
put
into
place
in
order
to
achieve
compliance
with
the
eeoa
with
respect
to
nogales
is
going
to
be
the
same
one
that
exists
throughout
the
state.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
it
could
be,
but
i
don't
think
there's
really
much
of
a
dispute
that
the
statewide
funding
measure
doesn't
really
affect
what
the
state's
going
to
do
in
this
case,
because--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
absolutely
not.
not
--
certainly
not
in
the
abstract.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't
think
it's
a
necessary
conclusion
of
my
argument,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
it's
a
conclusion
that
rests
on
we
are
in
this
litigation
in
this
particular
context,
given
the
arizona
constitution's
uniformity
clause.
it's
as
a
consequence
of
that
clause
that
this
issue
even
arises.
and
i
think
the
attorney
general--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
if
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
if
the
litigation
had
come
up
in
a
different
way,
justice
kennedy,
such
that
it
had
always
focused
exclusively
on
what
happened
in
nogales,
including
the
funding
aspect
of
the
case,
but
i
think
what
would
have
been
appropriate
is
that
the
district
court
would
have
inquired
about
what
funding
resources
belong
to
nogales
in
particular.
and
then
what
would
have
happened
by
operation
of
state
law
would
be
that,
whatever
the
funding
calculus
with
respect
to
nogales,
it
would
automatically
apply
across
the
state
because
of
the
arizona
constitution's
uniformity
clause.
now,
in
this
case,
the
litigation
--
the
complaint
was
assessed
against
the
entire
state,
and
the
attorney
general
accepted
that,
and
i
don't
think
at
this
point
in
time
we
can
revisit
that,
particularly
when
it's
largely
an
academic
question
given
the
uniformity
clause--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
two
points,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
first
--
and
i
don't
mean
to
quibble,
but
the
attorney
general
did
contest
the
litigation
at
the
outset.
what
happened
is,
after
a
judgment
was
issued
against
the
state,
then
i
think
there
was
an
acquiescence
in
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
sure,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
what
the
court
did
in
both
rufo
and
frew
is
it
accommodated
those
concerns,
and
it
accommodated
the
interest
in
finality
that
comes
from
judgments,
and
the
interests
in
allowing
a
different
set
of
state
officials
to
suggest
new
programs
to
make
that
suggestion
to
the
district
court.
and
it
accommodated
those
in
a
way
that
requires
a
showing
at
the
outset
that
there
has
been
a
significant
change
in
facts
or
a
significant
change
in
law.
and
on--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--the
one
that
was
outlined
by
this
court
in
rufo.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
a
significant
change
of
facts
or
a
significant
change
of
law.
and
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
on
page
49a
they
invoke
the
precise
wording
of
this
court,
cite
rufo
for
that
proposition,
and
also--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
--
i
would
give
effect
to
the
articulation
of
the
standard
in
the
standard
review
question
section
of
the
opinion.
of
course
you
could
remand
if
you
felt
that
it
was
necessary,
but
i
think
the
reason
why
the
ninth
circuit
uses
the
language
such
as
your
honor
found
in
72a
is
that
it
has
to
be
considered
in
the
context
of
the
nature
of
the
violation
and
the
nature
of
the
relief
sought.
the
violation
was
a
systematic
one;
the
relief
sought
is
a
complete
dissolution
of
the
judgment
and
ensuing
order,
and
in
that
context
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
what
is
significant
is
more
significant
than
what
would
be
the
case
in
--
for
example,
in
rufo,
where
what
was
sought
was
a
relatively
modest
modification
of
the
consent
order
concerning
whether
you
would
have
single
bunking
or
double
bunking.
now
on
the
question
of
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
significant
change
or
significant
change
of
facts
or
significant
change
in
law,
on
no
child
left
behind,
justice
scalia,
to
return
to
the
question
that
you
asked,
the
reason
that
no
child
left
behind
in
our
view
doesn't
displace
the
standard
for
eeoa
is
that
petitioner's
standard
is
that
as
long
as
the
state
has
an
approved
no
child
left
behind
plan,
which
is
true
of
all
50
states,
that
they
necessarily
satisfy
the
eeoa;
and
what
that
would
mean
is
that
even
if
a
state
didn't
implement
that
plan,
even
if
the
state
didn't
--
didn't
--
didn't
have
accountability
measures
that
it
in
fact
followed,
that
required
school
districts
to
achieve
the
annual
measurement
of
progress
that
would
be
laid
out
in
the
plan
--
notwithstanding
all
of
that,
a
plaintiff
would
lack
authority
to
come
into
the
court
and
litigate
his
private
cause
of
action
under
the
eeoa
and
get
a
court
order
that
requires
the
state
to
take
appropriate
action--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--simply
because
the
state
will
have
had
an
approved
plan.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
because--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--the
--
the
no
child
left
behind
act
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
approve
a
particular
program.
what
it
imposes
are
voluntarily
accepted
funding
conditions,
and
that
includes--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--what
the
eeoa
concerns
are
programs
that
are
reasonably
calculated
to
achieve
overcoming
language
barriers.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
what
no
child
left
behind
concerns
is,
is
there
a
testing
program
in
place
that
calls
for
certain
improvements
in
testing
over
time.
as
long
as
the
plan
describes
the
tests
that
will
be
taken
and
the
progress
that
will
be
achieved
or
sought
to
be
achieved
over
time,
a
plan
will
be
approved.
now,
even
if
the
state
doesn't
achieve
the
plan
--
the
progress
that
is
called
for
by
no
child
left
behind--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right.
it's
about
tests.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
even
if
you
don't
make
the
progress
--
and
if
i
could
finish
this
one
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
it
bears
noting
that
the
nogales
the
progress
called
for
no
child
left
behind
hasn't
been
made
in
the
last
two
years,
according
to
the
superintendent's
web
site.
even
if
you
don't
make
that
progress,
there
is
no
way
under
petitioner's
approach
to
vindicate
