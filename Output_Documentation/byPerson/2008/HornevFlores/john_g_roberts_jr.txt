chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-289,
horne
v.
flores
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
starr.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
very
much
true.
counsel,
why
don't
you
try
and
answer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
still
don't
have
an
answer
to
justice
breyer's
--
i
guess
justice
scalia's
question
following
up
on
justice
breyer's.
what
are
the
parameters
or
the
--
the
data
with
respect
to
the
figures
justice
breyer
gave
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
answer
is
that
justice
breyer's
figures
are
correct
with
respect
to
the
appropriate
bases
of
children.
you
are
just
saying
that
you
want
to
use
a
different
test
than
the
one
that
he
was
quoting?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
the
figures
are
accurate.
you
just
think
a
different
test
should
be
used?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
lost
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
guess,
as
i
understand
justice
alito's
question,
if
the
prior
order
is
based
on
funding
a
particular
plan
and
the
state
comes
back
and
says,
this
is
a
new
approach.
it
could
be
for
any
number
of
reasons,
and
say
that,
you
know,
the
plan
is
not
working,
or
there
have
been
other
budgetary
crises
in
the
state
that
strain
what
we
can
afford
to
spend
on
this
particular
program.
here's
another
plan.
the
funding
levels
are
different.
you
should
look
at
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
a
question
of
progress;
it's
a
question
of
the
plan
and
the
approach.
and
i
understood
the
ninth
circuit
--
i'm
looking
at
page
72a
--
it
talks
about
the
ell's
specific
funding
that
was
based
on
the
prior
order.
and
what
i
understood
the
state's
submission
to
be
--
look
at
what
the
superintendent
has
done
in
this
particular
case,
and
so
on,
so
that
those
specific
funding
levels
aren't
applicable.
and
i
would
have
thought
it
an
extraordinary
enough
thing
for
a
district
court
to
tell
a
state
legislature:
pass
this
budget,
and
you,
legislature,
pass
it,
and
--
i
guess
--
you,
governor,
sign
it,
or
you
are
not
going
to
be
in
compliance.
and
if
they've
come
up
with
a
different
way
with
different
funding
requirements,
i
don't
know
why
that's
not
a
changed
circumstance
that
justifies
looking
at
the
judgment--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
the
state
--
i
didn't
understand
the
state
to
disagree
that
there's
still
work
to
be
done.
i
thought
that
the
plan
--
the
point
was
that
their
approach
had
changed,
including
by
no
child
left
behind,
that
they
don't
have
to
reach
the
same
specific
funding
levels
that
the
district
court
order
required.
and
what
i
understood
the
ninth
circuit
to
say
is,
no,
those
specific
funding
levels
are
still
in
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--does
--
then
does
that
stay
true
without
regard
to
what
is
happening
economically
to
the
state?
in
other
words,
the
district
court
can
say:
you've
got
to
spend
this
much
money
on
this
program,
and
i
don't
care
what
it
means
for
jails,
roads,
anything
else,
when
there
are
profound
changes
in
economic
circumstances
of
the
sort
that
everybody's
experiencing
lately.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
gather
it's
often
the
case
in
institutional
litigation
of
this
sort
that
the
political
figures,
whether
it's
the
governor
or
the
attorney
general,
can't
go
to
the
voters
say,
look,
we
should
spend
more
money
on
this.
so
they
go
to
the
district
court
judge
and
say,
make
us
spend
more
money
on
this.
and
they
get
the
same
result
they'd
wanted
in
a
non-democratic
way,
particularly
when
there's
a
division,
such
as
here
the
legislature
doesn't
want
to
do
something,
and
the
governor
or
the
attorney
general
does.
so
why
should
we
put
a
lot
of
weight
on
what
the
representation
is
when
we
are
at
least
concerned
that
it
might
be
a
--
i
don't
mean
it
in
a
pejorative
sense
--
but
a
collusive
piece
of
litigation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
hard
for
the
attorney
general
to
get
funding
from
the
legislature
for
all
he
wants
to
do,
and
this
is
a
way
for
him
to
get
it,
to
go
to
the
legislature
and
say
look,
you
don't
have
a
choice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
ask
just
a
question
that
was
confusing
to
me?
what
standard
for
changed
circumstances
do
you
understand
the
ninth
circuit
to
have
applied?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
am
looking
at
page
72a
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
and
the
standard
they
use
there
is
radically
changed,
not
significantly
changed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
if
we
have
a
--
if
we
are
confused
as
to
which
standard
they
applied,
because
at
one
point
they
say
significantly
changed
and
at
another
point
they
say
radically
changed,
what
should
we
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
saharsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
when
you
were
starting
out
i
heard
you
articulate
a
third
standard,
materially
changed.
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
standard
applied
by
the
ninth
circuit?
was
it
materially
changed,
significantly
changed
or
radically
changed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
don't
either
but
i
see
both
of
them
being
different
from
radically
changed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
still
have
trouble
with
the
idea
of
district
courts
ordering
state
legislatures
to
fund
it.
isn't
the
preferable
approach
for
the
district
court
to
say
you
have
a
violation,
you
have
to
fix
it,
and
i'm
going
check
to
see
if
you
fixed
it
at
particular
intervals?
and
it's
up
to
you,
the
state,
to
determine
how
you
are
going
to
fix
it.
and
the
state
might
change
its
mind.
they
may
start
out
by
saying
we
have
got
all
of
this
extra
money
and
that's
how
we
will
fix
it.
then
there
is
a
budget
crisis,
the
kind
that
we
are
familiar
with,
and
he
says
we
can't
the
money,
we
are
going
to
do
it
some
other
way,
and
here's
the
way.
but
that's
kind
of
the
judgment
of
the
state,
not
for
the
district
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
does
it
order
then
--
why
did
its
order
specify
and
be
linked
to
the
termination
of
the
legislative
session,
and
say
you
have
12
days
left
in
the
session
and
that's
how
many
days
you
have
to
enact
this
budget?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
starr,
you
have
three
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
08-289,
horne
versus
flores
and
the
consolidated
case.
