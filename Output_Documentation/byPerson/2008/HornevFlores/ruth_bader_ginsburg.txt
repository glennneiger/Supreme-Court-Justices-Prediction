what
was
the
year,
mr.
starr,
the
year
of
that
change
to
the
sei
from
the
bilingual
education?
what
was
the
year
of
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet
the
district
court
kept
renewing
his
instruction,
provide
funding
that
reasonably
relates
to
the
cost,
many,
many
times
after
the
sei
became
effective.
and
we
--
we
have
the
original
decree
which
was,
what,
a
declaratory
judgment
in
2000.
then
he
issues
a
series
of
order.
none
--
and
none
of
them
are
ever
appealed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
starr,
can
i
take
you
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
60(b)
motion,
because
you
seem
to
have
shifted
ground?
the
60(b)
motion
as
presented
to
the
district
court
said
that
this
new
law
passed
by
the
arizona
legislature,
2064
--
"2064
creates
a
plan
for
adequate
funding
of
programs
for
the
ell
students.
"
that
was
the
whole
basis
for
the
60(b)
motion,
whether
the
new
law
was
supplied
adequate
funding,
and
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
senate
intervened
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
defending
the
new
law.
your
current
argument
is
detached
from
the
new
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
the
basis
for
the
64(b)
motion,
that
2064
provided
adequate
funding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
--
do
we
have
the
--
the
intervention
application
in
the
papers
before
us
and
the
60(b)
motion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
is
it
--
no
child
left
behind
i
thought
has
a
specific
saving
clause,
"nothing
in
this
part
shall
be
construed
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
any
federal
law
guaranteeing
a
civil
right.
"
and
the
eeoa
is
such
a
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
the
fault
of
the
arizona
attorney
general,
who
told
the
court:
you
cannot
deal
with
nogales
alone
because
under
the
arizona
constitution
the
--
all
--
all
the
school
districts
have
to
be
treated
equally.
so,
it
wasn't
the
plaintiffs
that
initiated
that
move
to
make
it
statewide;
it
was
in
fact
the
arizona
attorney
general.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
came
in
in
2000
and
this
case
was
going
on
for,
what,
eight,
nine
years
before
there
was
ever
an
argument.
i
mean
in
all
of
these
orders
that
were
not
appealed,
don't
those
judgments,
unappealed
judgments,
settle
anything?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
think
there
was
in
the
district
judge's
declaratory
judgment,
spend
this
much
on
teachers
aides,
that
much
on
the
other.
it
was:
you
need
a
plan
and
you
have
to
figure
out
how
much
it
costs,
and
then
you
have
to
appropriate
money
that
matches
the
cost.
but
the
district
court
--
i
may
be
wrong
about
this,
but
i
thought
that
the
original
declaratory
judgment
didn't
try
to
tell
them
what
the
components
of
that
plan
had
to
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
was
speaking
alone
for
years
and
years,
and
60(b)
--
and
it
has
been
said
over
and
over
again
--
is
not
a
substitute
for
appeal.
what
wasn't
appealed
was
that
arizona
is
required
by
federal
law
to
determine
the
cost
and
adequately
fund
a
statewide
system
of
english
acquisition
programming.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
new
plan
that
we're
talking
about,
is
20
--
there
have
been
references
--
well,
now
they
have
a
new
plan.
does
everybody
agree
at
least
that
the
new
plan
is
2064?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
couldn't
the
district
court
give
them
the
relief
to
which
they
were
entitled
even
if
it
was
less
than
what
they
sought?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
district
--
the
district
judge
said
that
that
2064
did
not
have
enough,
it
raised
it
to
450
or
whatever.
and
the
district
court
said
there
are
three
things
wrong
with
it,
the
two
years,
using
the
federal
funds
to
--
to
supplant
not
supplement,
and
that
the
$450
figure
wasn't
enough.
and
the
only
way
that
$450
figure
was
going
to
get
changed
was
through
legislation,
right?
