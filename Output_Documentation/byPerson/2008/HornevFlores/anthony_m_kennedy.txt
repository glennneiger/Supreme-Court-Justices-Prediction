justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
me
what
your
submission
is
with
respect
to
the
error
you
see
in
the
findings
and
the
order
made
after
the
eight-day
hearing?
first,
are
you
saying
that
after
no
child
left
behind
that
the
duty
of
the
state
with
respect
to
educating
the
students
who
have
a
different
language
was
less
onerous?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
and
are
you
saying
that
because
of
that
methodology
any
remedy
based
on
funding
is
no
longer
appropriate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
could
--
is
it
valid
as
to
nogales,
if
we
focus
just
on
nogales?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
--
are
you
saying
that
the
order
the
district
court
gave
with
respect
just
to
nogales--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
inappropriate
because
it
used
a
funding
remedy
or
a
funding
measure
of
compliance
when
it
should
have
used
blank,
and
then
fill
in
the
blank?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
very
odd
that
--
assume
you
have
a
constitutional
provision
which
says
funding
must
be
equal
in
each
district.
then
you
find
one
district
that's
way
behind,
and
that
is,
we
will
assume,
is
--
has
been
deficient
in
--
in
providing
language
education.
you
are
saying
that
if
the
court
orders
more
money
spent
for
that
district,
it
must
automatically
order
money
--
additional
money
for
every
other
district
in
the
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
yes,
but
that
seems
to
me
the
necessary
conclusion
of
your
argument
in
the
answer
you
gave
justice
scalia.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
again,
what
you're
--
you're
saying
that
any
time
a
district
court
in
a
single
district
orders
more
money
to
remedy
a
constitutional
problem,
that
because
of
that
clause
it
has
to
apply
to
every
other
district.
that
just
can't
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
--
and
if
it
is,
then
that
is
a
very
good
reason
for
the
district
court
to
cede
its
jurisdiction
to
the
state
authorities.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
district
court
on
the
8-day
hearing
on
remand
make
a
finding
that
its
incremental
funding
determinations
that
it
had
made
earlier
were
an
accurate
way
to
measure
compliance
and
to
insist
on
compliance
under
the
new
immersion
program?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
starr,
based
on
this
last
argument,
that
it
actually
is
in
your
favor
if
the
order
of
the
court
as
to
one
district
automatically
requires
additional
expenditure
for
every
other
district,
that
is
simply
one
more
measure
that
the
court
should
use
in
finding
an
alternate
remedy.
