mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
january
of
2000
the
district
court
in
arizona
concluded
that
the
nogales
school
system
had
failed
to
provide
an
equal
educational
opportunity
for
its
english
language
learners
in
that
particular
district.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
your
honor,
the
specific
finding
was
that
there
needed
to
be
--
there
were
very
elaborate
findings
here.
there
needed
in
fact
to
be
remediation
to
in
fact
support
a
plan,
and
the
state--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--you
are
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
needs
to
be
a
rational
plan.
but
then
by
the
time
of
the
60(b)
hearing,
the
circumstances
had
dramatically
changed.
there
had
been
a
failure.
but
in
november
of
2000,
a
sea
change
occurred
in
educational
policy.
the
old
system
in
nogales
was
done
away
with
throughout
the
state.
strategic
english
immersion,
intense
immersion,
and
the
results
are
already
being
shown.
nogales--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
voters
voted
it
in,
in
november
of
2000,
and
it
began
feathering
in
very
promptly
as
soon
as
the
school
districts
could
in
fact
respond,
and
nogales--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
is
true.
and
in
fact
one
of
the
grounds
of
our
submission
this
morning
is
that
the
failure
to
appeal
should
be
in
fact
a
cause
for
concern.
indeed,
60(b)(5)
is
all
about
exceptions
to
finality,
especially
when
we
are
dealing
with
a
very
quintessential
state
and
local
function,
namely,
education.
and,
thus,
the
court
should
have
been
open
to
consider
what
the
ninth
circuit
had
commanded
it
consider,
namely
the
changed
circumstances.
and
what
were
those
changed
circumstances?
nogales
was
doing
great.
a
new
leadership
came
in.
superintendent
cooper
made
tremendous
reforms.
the
state
responded,
not
only
with
a
new
methodology,
but
by
funding
that
methodology.
and,
your
honor,
all
of
this--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--your
honor,
first
of
all,
the
exam
to
which
you
are
referring
is
given
in
english.
if
i
am
taking
german,
then
i
am
not
going
to
do
well
in
a
german--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
the
point
is
the
--
the
exam
that
you
should
look
at
is
the
azela
exam.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
here
is
--
and
i
think
we
can
cut
to
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
thank
you.
i
would
go,
if
i
would
--
if
you
would,
to
page
46a
of
our
pet.
ap,
where
you
--
petition
appendix,
where
you,
in
fact,
get
the
information
summarized,
and
then
go
to
--
and
this
is
the
ninth
circuit's
own
words
that
"nogales
is
doing
substantially
better",
"the
state
has
developed
a
significantly
improved
infrastructure.
"
and
then
if
you
go
to
the
superintendent's
petition
appendix,
you
will
see
--
this
is
the
relevant
information
under
no
child
left
behind,
which
is
one
of
the
changed
circumstances
--
the
nogales
students
are,
in
fact,
doing
better
than
across
the
state.
the
key
is
to
measure
the
progress
that
has,
in
fact,
been
made
and
that
is
not
disputed.
everyone
agrees.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
the
key,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
appendix
312
of
the
superintendent's
petition
and
the
prior
pages.
and
that
gives
the
percentage
of
students
making
progress
under
the
exams
that
are
administered
by
the
state
statewide,
and
that
you
will
see
that
throughout,
including
in
the
high
school,
that
the
students
are,
in
fact,
making
progress.
the
district
court
concluded
that
nogales
had--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
again,
my
quarrel
with
his
figures
had
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
test
being
exam.
there
are
different
tests
being
administered.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
one
shouldn't
take
too
seriously
a
test
that
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
not
home
yet,
your
honor,
is,
in
fact,
the
key
question.
what
is
home?
and
that
brings
us
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
that
is
incorrect,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
there
has
been
a
substantial
increase
in
funding,
which
we
supply
and
summarize
at
pages
22
and
23
of
the
opening
brief.
and
you
will
see
throughout
the
testimony
--
the
testimony
is
absolutely
clear,
including
the
plaintiffs',
the
respondents',
key
witness,
dr.
zumudio,
agreed
that
there
has,
in
fact,
been
substantial
progress,
indeed
there
is
an
effective
program
in
place.
and
so
our
fundamental
quarrel
with
the
approach
of
the
district
court
is
it
blinded
itself
to
the
significant
changes
structurally
as
well
as
the
progress
that
had
been
made
and
just
said
it
doesn't
matter
because
this
is
all
about
funding,
and
that
is
not
true.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
is
not
detached,
but
our
submission
is,
in
fact,
that
we
look
to
what
the
district
court
had
before
it
in
the
60(b)(5)
hearing.
it
had
an
eight-day
evidentiary
hearing.
it
was
not
simply
legal
argument
over
that
particular
bill.
and
that
evidence--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--your
honor,
there
were
a
variety
of
points
made,
and
the
60(b)
submission
was
not
limited
to
this
new
bill.
rather,
it
was
a
totality
of
the
circumstances,
here
are
the
changed
circumstances.
that's
what
the
whole
eight-day
trial
was
about.
the
eight-day
trial
was
about
what
are
the
new
funding
mechanisms,
what
is
happening
on
the
ground
in
nogales.
and
as
i
say,
even
the
respondents'
own
key
witness
said
that
there
is
an
effective
ell
program
now
in
place,
and
that,
in
fact,
progress--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
you
do
--
you
do
have
it
before
you.
and
there
is
no
question
that
the
speaker
and
the
president
were,
in
fact,
submitting
to
the
district
court
hb
2064
as
part
of
the
submission.
my
point
is
the
evidentiary
hearing
went
much
more
broadly
and
here's
the
key:
under
the
eeoa,
all
that
is
required
under
the
castaneda
framework
is,
in
fact,
good
faith
efforts
toward
compliance.
the
questions
that
are
flowing
suggest
there
has
been
no
good
faith
effort
at
compliance,
and
there
has
been.
that's
what
the
eight-day
hearing
was
all
about.
that's
one
of
the
things
that
superintendent
cooper
testified
to
and
discredited.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
as
--
that
is
correct.
but
as
to
the
latter
with
respect
to
the
federal
funds,
supplant
versus
supplement,
all
that
we
have
is
--
and
this
is
an
issue
that
is
entrusted
to
the
department
of
education.
it's
not
trusted
to
the
district
courts
under
no
child
left
behind.
this
is
an
apparatus
that
congress
has
determined
there
should
no
longer
be
--
not
that
eeoa
doesn't
--
it
has
its
beachhead,
it
has
its
place,
but
now
no
child
left
behind
has
a
very
elaborate
process
including
a
plan,
and
arizona
is
in
compliance
with
that
plan.
the
point
is
the
hb
2064
points
completely
blinded
the
district
court
to
what
was
actually
before
him,
and
we
think
that
that
is
wrong.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
disagreement
within
the
house
with
respect
to
that.
but,
your
honor,
there
is
no
authority
on
the
part
of
a
federal
court
under
no
child
left
behind
to
render
this
kind
of
interpretation.
and
it
has
blinded
us
--
ultimately,
it
is
irrelevant.
it
has
blinded
us
to
the
issue--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
is
correct.
the
point
that
i
am
making
is
the
interpretation
of
supplemental
versus
supplant
is
in
fact
one
that
is
entrusted
to
the
department
of
education.
we
only
have
a
letter.
that's
not
final
agency
action.
but
i
want
to
return
to
what
we
think
is
the
key
in
a
60(b)(5)
hearing.
what
is
key
in
60(b)(5)
is
to
listen
to
the
changed
circumstances.
what
are
the
changed
circumstances?
and
the
court
blinded
itself
to
these
very
important
changes
in
terms
of
state
funding--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
numbers
are
not
wrong,
your
honor,
but
the
numbers
are
in
fact
not
the
pivotal
point.
the
eeoa
is
not
a
funding
statute,
and
let
me
come
to
the
specific
point
of
cost
studies.
the
state
of
arizona
did
in
fact
seek
to
undertake
a
statewide
cost
study.
and
our
--
one
of
our
fundamental
problems
here
is
this
case
is
no
longer
about
nogales.
it
has
been
expanded.
even
though
it
was
a
class
action
limited
to
nogales,
it
has
been
expanded
to
include
an
intrusion
into
the
prerogatives
of
the
state.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
and
we
are
now
seeking
relief
from
that,
because
what
we
now
know--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--what
has
changed--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
state
law
does
not
require
specific
earmarked
funding,
district
by
district,
and
here's
the
key--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it's
why
the
district
court
should
have
been
on
guard--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--your
honor,
we
are
not
trying
to
relitigate
the
original
judgment.
we
quarrel
with
it,
but
that's
not
why
we're
here.
we're
here--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
was--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--there
is
--
there
is
no
question
that
there
was
a
division
of
the
opinion
within
the
state
and
that
in
fact
the
attorney
general
was
essentially
siding
with
the
plaintiffs
in
their
litigation.
there
is
now
a
very
different
perspective
and
you
have
that
before
you,
that
the
governor
who
controls
the
litigation
in
the
state
is
the
chief
executive
of
the
state
in
terms
of
determining
what
the
state's
position
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
it's
not
less
onerous,
but
there
is
a
different
methodology
and
a
different
approach.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
a
funding
remedy
is
in
fact
inappropriate
presumptively
statewide.
that
is
our
key
submission,
because
of
the
variation
in
costs,
district
by
district.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not
in
terms
of
changed
circumstances,
because
of
what
has
in
fact
happened
on
the
ground.
namely,
one
of
the
thing
when
we
go
back
to
the
original
order--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
it
should
have
simply
determined
under
castaneda
the
three-part
test.
it
should
not
have
said
the
eeoa
requires
a
particular
level
of
funding.
that's
precisely
what
castaneda--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--and--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
did
go
beyond
that
in
this
sense.
it
did
not
in
fact
determine
whether
in
fact
there
was
an
effective
program
in
place.
that's
the
oddity
about
this
case--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no.
the
difficulty
is
seeking
to
enforce
a
specific
funding
order,
and
particularly
statewide,
which
intrudes--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
district
court
failed
to
note
that
plan
a
had
changed.
there
was
no
longer
a
plan
a.
it
was
strategic
english
immersion
which
has
an
entirely
different
methodology.
and
what
it
also--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--of
--
of
course.
they
let
that
judgment
stand
during
that
period
of
time.
but
the
whole
purpose
of
60(b)(5)
is
relief
from
finality.
it's
a--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
it
said
that
--
here
is
what
the
court
held:
that
it
has
developed
a
significantly
improved
infrastructure
for
ell
programming,
but
it
has
not
complied
with
the
original
judgment.
that
is
our
complaint.
the
original
funding
judgment
was
in
fact
informed
by
a
different
methodology
and
a
different
set
of
circumstances.
for
example,
superintendent
cooper
comes
in
and
says:
i
don't
want
to
spend
money
on
teachers'
aides;
they
are
standing
in
the
way.
yet
the
respondents
say:
we
need
money
for
teachers'
aides.
that's
part
of
no
child
left
behind.
inputs
--
now
we
look
at
--
we
test,
we
determine
what
progress
is
being
made
and,
we
are
requiring
progress
to
be
made.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
you
are
precisely
right,
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
the
objects
of
that
underlying
decree
shifted
by
virtue
of
the
new
methodology
that
was
in
fact
adequately
funded
through
a
whole
variety
of
funds.
the
funds
that
justice
breyer
has
referred
to
are
only
part
of
the
basket
of
funds
that
have
been
made
available.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
believe
not.
we
believe
that
ultimately
those
two
issues
are
irrelevant
to
the
issue
that
is
before
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
wrongly,
because
that's
--
that's
part
of
our
quarrel,
that
the
district
court
simply
focused
on
these
two
elements
of
hb
2064,
and
blinded
itself
to
the
evidence--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
is
correct,
and
that
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--three
brief
points.
on
the
study,
the
state
did
undertake
a
study,
and
this
is
in
the
record.
and
the
national
conference
of
state
legislators
said:
we
throw
up
our
hands
because
we
can't
do
this
statewide.
i
would
invite
the
court
to
refocus
on
nogales
as
a
district
versus
statewide.
what
was
entered
here
in
this
order,
which
makes
it
so
extraordinary,
is
that
the
entire
state
funding
mechanism
has
been
interfered
with
by
the
order.
this
case
started
out
in
nogales.
and
so
the
statewide
study
was
in
fact
undertaken.
but
we
could
not
do
it.
the
national
conference
of
state
legislatures
said:
we
throw
up
our
hands.
we
can
do
a
local
study,
and
it
was
done.
and
if
the
court
refocuses
on
the
various
tranches
of
funding,
including
in
nogales
itself
and
from
the
state,
one
will
see
that
there
has
been
a
very
substantial
increase
in
the
actual
funding
as
well
as
progress.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
but
we
should
be
able
now
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
your
honor,
not
under
60(b),
and
this
court
has
warned
about
the
ability
of
state
officials--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--not
under
arizona
law.
it
is
the
governor
who
speaks
and
the
attorney
general
is
beholden--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
your
honor.
the
district
court
is
to
listen
to
what
the
state
has
to
say
through
--
once
the
legislature
was
fine.
it
was
brought
in.
it
should
have
listened
to
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
your
honor,
not
in
arizona.
the
attorney
general
speaks
for
the
state
when
the
governor
directs
him
or
her
to
do
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
and
former
officials
shouldn't
continue
to
be
able
to
bind
the
state.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
your
honor.
the
state
funding
remedy
here
is
extraordinarily
intrusive
and
overreaching.
it
is
something
that
has
not
been
done
under
the
eeoa
ever,
and
certainly
the
no
child
left
behind
provision
should
inform
now
this
particular
remedy.
the
remedy
was
originally,
of
course,
designed
to
address
the
situation
in
nogales,
but
it
was
expanded--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it's
part--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but,
your
honor,
there
is
a
very
elaborate
plan
that
is
submitted
and
then
a
determination
is
made
by
the
federal
government
about
funds
under
title
1
and
title
3,
but
here
is
our
fundamental
submission.
the
ninth
circuit
simply
applied
the
wrong
60(b)standard.
it,
in
fact,
used
this
remarkable
language,
but
it
also
of
radical
change,
but
it
also
gave
undue
weight.
it
said
it
ten
times
to
the
fact
that
the
original
judgment
was
on
appeal,
and
then
it
simply
did
not
pay
heed
to
the
incredibly
intrusive
nature
of
a
statewide
funding
remedy
in
light
of
the
fact
that
we
can
now
look
at
what
has
happened
in
nogales.
we
see
the
changes
that
have,
in
fact,
been
there,
and
certainly
the
eeoa
by
its
design
in
section
1712
of
eeoa
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
remedial
reach
of
the
eeoa
is
quite
limited.
it's
limited
to
particular
circumstances.
here
the
eeoa
has
been
transmogrified
to
apply
statewide.
that
has
not
been
done
before.
it
should
not
have
been
done
in
the
first
instance
but
certainly
in
light
of
the
changed
circumstances.
and
the
changed
circumstances,
justice
ginsburg,
go
back
to
structured
english
immersion.
they
did
not
begin
with
the
passage
of
hb
2064.
structured
english
immersion
came
in
in
the
year
2000.
that
is
why
the
legislature
then
came
in
and
put
these
facts
in
evidence
before
the
district
court,
which
made
no
factual
findings
statewide
at
all,
ever.
there
are
no
statewide
factual
findings
in
this
record
whatsoever,
none.
and
therefore
statewide
funding
remedy
should
not
have
been
permitted.
sixty
(b)(5)
relief
should
be
granted.
i
thank
the
court.
