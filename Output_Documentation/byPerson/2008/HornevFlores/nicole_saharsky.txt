ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
important
to
recognize
what
petitioners
asked
for
here
at
the
rule
60(b)(5)
stage.
that
was
complete
dissolution
of
the
court's
immediate
orders.
it
was
not
to
just
limit
those
orders
just
to
nogales;
it
was
not
to
improve
--
or
to
approve
improvements
in
nogales
as
an
interim
measure.
as
a
result,
the
burden
was
on
them
to
show
either
full
compliance
with
the
orders
the
district
court
had
entered
or
material
changed
circumstances
that
made
compliance
unnecessary.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
certainly.
but
they
didn't
demonstrate
that
--
entitlement
to
that
relief
either.
to
the
extended
we
are
talking
about
the
question
of
whether
conditions
had
changed
in
nogales
that
there
was
no
longer
an
ongoing
violation
of
federal
law,
the
district
court
held
an
8-day
evidentiary
hearing,
and
it
made
factual
findings
showing
that
the
problems
had
not
ceased
in
nogales.
and
as
you
noted,
justice
ginsburg,
this
changed
circumstances
argument
that
is
now
heavily
relied
upon
by
petitioners
was
not
the
primary
thrust
of
their
argument
before
the
district
court.
the
primary
thrust
of
their
argument
was
that
hb
2064,
which
is
the
state's
scheme
for
ell
education,
had
some
serious
--
would
--
would
satisfy
the
judgment;
and
their
other
argument
was
that
no
child
left
behind
completely
preempts
--
that
was
the
language
they
use
--
completely
preempts
and
renders
obsolete
the
eeoa.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
understand
it
to
be
significant
change,
which,
i
don't
see
significant
and
material
as
being
all
that
different.
i
think
that
the--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--again,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
particularly
where
it
starts
out
with
the
standard
of
review,
it
cites
this
court's
precedents
in
rufo
and
agostini;
it
talks
about
the
need
for
significant
changed
circumstances.
i
understand
that
there
are
portions
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
that
say
--
that
have
the
radical
change
language,
and
again,
i
--
i
think
that
that
language
is
--
just
reflects
the
arguments
that
petitioners
were
making,
that
they
wanted
complete
relief
from
these
remedial
orders
and
that,
you
know,
the
underlying
judgment
here
was
a
systemic
violation.
i
mean,
it's--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
and
please
correct
me
if
i
don't,
but
the
district
court
considered
two
different
arguments.
the
first
was
under
house
bill
2064
which
considered
to
have
--
which
continued
to
have
this
incremental
funding.
it's
that
we
have
two
problems
with
house
bill
2064,
which
were
the
two-year
cutoff
and
federal
funding
problem.
on
the
second
question
which
--
the
second
argument
petitioners
made
which
said,
everything
is
fine
in
nogales
because
we
have
money
from
other
funds,
the
district
court
said
no,
there's
--
there's
been
an
ongoing
violation
of
federal
law.
you
haven't
met
your
burden
of
showing
me
that
violation
ceased
because
things
aren't
better
in
nogales.
do--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
the
reason
the
district
court
was
focused
on
that
because
that
was
always
the
state's
position
that,
in
terms
of
the
statewide
scheme,
that
that
is
how
they
were
going
to
fund
ell
education.
now
it
--
and
so
the
state
was
always,
from
2000
up
to
the
time
of
the
district
court's
rule
60(b)
hearing,
going
down
this
path
whereby
it
would
put
in
place
an
ell
program
and
then
give
this
amount
of
funding--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
the
district
court
could
have
found
that
the
plan
had
changed
and
that
funding
could
come
from
--
from
different
places.
that's
right,
if
the
state
had
changed
its
plans
or
that
nogales
otherwise
would
have
sufficient
funding
from
circumstances
that
--
or
from
other
source,
that
would
be
one
thing.
but
the
district
court
found
that
nogales
doesn't
have
that
funding
from
other
sources.
for
example,
it
can't
use
the
federal
funding
that
it
--
that
the
petitioners
claim
could
be
used
to
solve
its
problem
under
the
eeoa.
there
are
specific
conditions
on
federal
grant
programs
that
forbid
that.
it
also
could
not
raise
any
significant
amounts
of
funding
through
county
tax
overrides,
which
was
another
source
the
petitioners
had
said
would
--
would
provide
sufficient
funding.
so
the
question
the
district
court
had
to
ask
is,
there
has
been
an
ongoing
violation
of
federal
law,
has
that
violation
of
federal
--
federal
law
ceased
because
the
state
has
put
in
place,
nogales
has
put
in
place
programs
that
are
reasonably
calculated
to
help
these
kids
learn
english?
and
the
district
court
said
nogales
has
cobbled
together
these
sources
of
funding.
and
it
is
doing
the
best
they
can.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
with
respect,
i
don't
think
that
that
was
their
exclusive
focus.
i
understand
that
it
was
a
primary
focus
of
that
decision,
and
the
reason
for
that
was
because
the
primary
argument--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that's
right.
and
what
i
understand
that
to
mean
is
that
they
were
required
to
either
show
compliance
with
the
judgment
which
was
that
they
would
put
together
a
plan
that
funded
ell
education
based
on
incremental
costs
or
that
the
state
was
going
to
go
down
a
different
path
and
come
up
with
the
funding
some
other
way,
and
that
would
result
in
a
program
reasonably
calculated
to
help
ell
students
learn
english.
and
the
district
court
found
there
were
neither
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
there
were
neither.
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
go
through
the
alleged
changed
circumstances,
and
nogales
had
issued
a
91-page
opinion
that
talked
about
the
significant
resource
constraints
that
still
exist
in
nogales
and
the
persistent
achievement
gaps
that
still
exist
in
nogales.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
and
i
think
the
district
court
was
appropriately
differential
to
the
state
throughout
this
litigation.
you
will
note
at
the
time
of
the
2000
judgment
that
the
district
court
didn't
put
any
remedial
order
in
place.
and
that's
because
at
the
time
of
trial
the
state
said,
look,
we
are
going
to
put
in
place
an
ell
program
that
everyone
in
the
state
can
use
and
figure
out
how
much
it
costs,
what
works
and
what
doesn't.
we
are
going
to
do
a
cost
study,
so
please
let
us
do
the
cost
study
and
we
will
come
back
to
the
court.
and
the
district
court
said
fine.
and
ten
months
later
that
didn't
happen.
now,
there
was
a
change,
as
petitioners
note,
to
a
different
theory
of
ell
education,
structured
english
immersion
and
the
court
said,
okay,
do
your
program
based
on
structured
english
immersion
and
just
tell
me
how
much
it
costs,
tell
me
how
you
rationally
fund
it,
and
that
will
be
fine.
the
district
court
here
did
not
want
to
be
in
the
business
of
micromanaging
state
education.
through
this
entire
litigation
the
district
court
was--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
it's
because
the
state
kept
coming
back
to
the
district
court
and
saying
that
the
legislature
had
asked
for
this
cost
study,
there
was
an
interim
bill,
house
bill
2010,
where
the
legislature
said
we
put
in
place
another
study
that
we
are
going
to
perform.
and
it's
because
the
state
said
--
constantly
said
the
legislature
is
going
to
do
this
cost
study,
figure
out
how
much
good
programs
cost,
the
school
--
the
state
board
will
be
involved,
et
cetera,
that
the
district
court
entered
its
orders
looking
to
the
time
period
in
which
it
expected
action
to
occur.
i
mean,
this
happened
over
a
nine-year
period.
the
district
court,
to
be
clear
--
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
point
--
never
said
you
need
to
do
any
special
kind
of
ell
program,
bilingual,
structured
english
immersion,
you
need
to
have
any
certain
number
of
teachers,
nothing
like
that.
and
it
never
said
you
need
to
put
this
certain
amount
of
funding
in
place,
$200,
$300
per
student,
anything
like
that.
and
petitioners
at
the
rule
60(b)(5)
stage
faced
a
heavy
burden
to
show
if
what
they
wanted
to
show
was
that
the
state
was
now
going
to
go
down
this
new
and
different
path,
because
even
at
the
time
of
the
rule
60(b)(5)
hearing,
the
state
was
on
the
same
path.
it
had
just
passed
house
bill
2064,
which
just
like
at
the
time
of
the
2000
judgment
said
we
are
going
to
put
a
statewide
program
in
place
for
ell
education--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--could
i
answer
that?
i
think
the
problem
with
the
$450
figure
is
that
the
district
court
was
never
told
what
the
state
was
planning
to
buy
with
that,
what
that
$450
was
for.
the
state
--
the
district
court
just
said
to
the
state,
please
tell
me
what
your
programs
are
going
to
do
and
approximately
how
much
it
costs
to
fund
them.
and
that
450
wasn't
tied
to
any
particular
ell
programs.
that
was
the
problem.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
no,
as
i
understand
it--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--when
it's
talking
about
a
uniform--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--and
equal
amount,
it's
talking
about
the
amount
that
the
state
gives
to
the
school
districts.
it's
not
with
respect
to
any
federal
funding
from
other
sources.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
that
the
idea
was
that
there
needed
to
be
--
the
state
determined
that
there
needed
to
be
--
it
was
going
to
solve
the
problem
statewide
not
only
because
of
the
concern
under
the
state
constitutions,
that
it
would
provide
for
all
ell
students.
and
it
was
not
that
it
would
provide
the
same
amount
to
each
school
district,
but
just
the
same
amount
per
ell
student.
that
the
state
had
decided
that
it
was
going
to
fill
that
responsibility
because
--
both
because
of
the
constitution
and
because
it's
responsible
for
supervising
education
statewide.
thank
you.
