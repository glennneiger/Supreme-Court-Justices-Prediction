justice
david
h.
souter
i
--
i
thought
the
determination
was
that
it
had
failed
to
provide
funds
that
could
reasonably
accomplish
the
--
the
--
the
plan
which
the
district
itself
had
adopted.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
district
agreed
on
that,
i
take
it.
the
district
said,
you've
got
to
do
something.
this
is
our
plan.
and
i
thought
the
district
court
then
said
--
the
school
district
did
that,
and
i
thought
the
district
court
then
said,
well,
the
--
the
funding
that
you
have
come
up
with,
or
the
funding
scheme
you
have
come
up
with
simply
is
not
rationally
related
to
the
plan
that
you,
yourself,
have
adopted.
am
i
--
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
--
help
me
out
then.
i
thought
the
--
the
issue
was
not
whether
there
had
been
any
good
faith
attempt
at
compliance,
but
whether
there
were
two
deficiencies
under
the
scheme,
under
the
--
i
forget
the
statute
--
the
new
bill.
one
deficiency
was
that
it
limited
the
funding
for
any
given
student
subject
to
--
to
ell
--
to
two-year
funding
when,
in
fact,
the
evidence
showed
that
you
couldn't
get
a
kid
up
to
par
with
two
years
of
education.
the
second
deficiency
was
that
the
--
that
the
state
funds
--
strike
that,
i'm
sorry
--
that
federal
funds
were
being
used
to
supplant
what
should
have
been
a
state
responsibility
rather
than
merely
supplementing.
i
take
it
that
is
simply
a
matter
of
degree,
but
that
was
the
problem.
i
thought
those
were
the
two
problems,
two-year
funding,
supplantation.
am
i
--
am
i
wrong?
so
there
was
no
--
my
point
is
that
there
was
no
denial
that
some
good
faith
efforts
had
been
made.
the
finding
was
that
there
were
two
deficiencies
and
these
were
the
two
deficiencies;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
should
--
has
the
state
law
changed?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
the
reason
--
the
reason
for
getting
into
this
is
that
the
state
required
it.
has
the
state
law
changed?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
we
are
not
talking
about
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
district
court
supposed
to
do?
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
comes
in
and
says,
do
it
this
way.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
has
no
standing
later
on
to
say:
oh,
gee,
the
district
court
should
have
said:
sorry,
mr.
attorney
general;
you
don't
know
anything
about
your
state
law;
we
won't
do
it
this
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
isn't
what
it
--
i
don't
understand
that
it
has
ever
said
that.
i
thought
the
funding
point
was
basically
this:
you,
nogales,
have
come
up
with
plan
a.
you
have
come
up
with
funding
b.
funding
b
is
not
enough
money
to
fund
plan
a.
it
is
your
plan,
you've
got
to
fund
your
plan.
that
is
not
saying
that
the
federal
statute
requires
a
particular
level
of
funding.
it's
not
saying
that
the
district
court
can
take
over
the
responsibility
of
deciding
what
is
appropriate
funding
in
a
school
district.
it's
simply
saying,
"if
you
choose
plan
a,
you
have
got
to
pay
for
plan
a.
"
justice
david
h.
souter
am
i
--
am
i
wrong?
did
it
ever
go
beyond
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
it
should
have
said:
before
i
decide
whether
your
funding
for
plan
a
is
good
enough,
i
have
got
to
decide
whether
plan
a
itself
is
worth
anything?
i
mean,
i
have
got
to
evaluate
plan
a?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let's
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
point
a
moment
ago.
let's
just
talk
about
nogales
for
a
minute.
with
respect
to
plan
a,
that
was
nogales'
plan.
and
the
district
court
said:
you
can't
fund
that
plan
with
the
amount
of
money
that
you
have
appropriated.
did
the
district
court
go
beyond
that
with
respect
to
nogales?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
doesn't
it
--
doesn't
it
--
don't
we
come
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
of
a
moment
ago?
even
with
the
--
the
changed
plan
to
immersion,
isn't
the
finding
that
two
years
of
funding
per
child
is
not
enough?
and
you
are
supplanting,
not
supplementing.
isn't
that
still
the
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
those
are
the
issues
that
the
court
focused
on;
are
they
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
has
60(b)
got
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
the
attorney
general
represents
the
state
before
the
court?
if
the
attorney
general
comes
back
into
court
and
says,
no
longer
do
we
want
this
statewide,
then
you've
got
an
issue.
if
the
--
if
the
attorney
general
speaking
for
the
state
does
not
do
that,
then
i
don't
see
why
justice
scalia's
point
is
not
the
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
district
court
is
supposed
to
referee
a
fight
between
the
governor
and
the
attorney
general
at
this
point?
is
that
what's
going
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
the
attorney
general
speak
for
the
state?
