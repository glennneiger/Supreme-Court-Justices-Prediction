justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
their
argument,
counsel.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
their
argument
that
no
child
left
behind
supplants
the
earlier
act.
it
is
simply
their
--
their
argument
is
that
it
informs
an
interpretation
of
the
language
of
eeoa,
which
is
that
the
state
is
required
to
take
appropriate
action,
which
is
a
very
vague
standard.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
this
question
about
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
which
is
what
we
are
reviewing?
suppose
--
i
know
there
--
there
is
a
debate
about
how
well
nogales
is
doing
at
this
time.
but
let's
suppose
nogales
came
in,
and
they
said
this:
we
had
plan
a
back
when
this
was
originally
litigated,
and
now
we
have
an
entirely
different
plan,
and
this
plan
doesn't
cost
one
penny
more
than
what
we
were
spending
in
2000.
but
it
is
a
very
good
plan,
and
it
has
produced
very
good
results.
as
i
read
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
they
would
not
grant
relief
from
the
judgment
under
those
circumstances,
because
they
focus
exclusively
on
incremental
funding
for
eel
programs
and
arizona's
funding
model.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
isn't
--
that
isn't
really
my
question.
isn't
--
isn't
it
the
case
that
the
ninth
circuit
judged
the
--
the
permissibility
of
relief
under
60(b)
solely
with
regard
to
incremental
funding
and
arizona's
funding
model?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
the
way
it
was
litigated
originally,
but
i
thought
the
whole
focus
of
the
motion
for
relief
from
the
judgment
was:
we
have
a
new
plan,
and
it
is
not
tied
to
funding,
and
it
will
produce
good
results
without
looking
at
incremental
eel
funding.
and
wasn't
the
ninth
circuit
obligated
to
look
at
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
does
it
matter
that
there
is
--
why
focus
on
incremental
funding
for
ell
programs
exclusively?
what
difference
does
it
make
where
the
money
comes
from
--
where
it
comes
from,
putting
aside
federal
money
that
can't
be
supplanted?
i
just
don't
understand
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
may
have
been
their
--
that
may
have
been
their
position
originally,
but
at
the
time
of
the
60(b)
hearing,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
money
came
from
funds
that
were
designated
for
ell
program,
or
from
general
state
funds,
or
from
county
funds?
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
money
was
taken
from
some
other
program
that
the
school
was
operating?
suppose
they
fund
--
they
take
the
money
for
the
ell
programs
from
money
that
was
previously
used
for
music
instruction,
or
art,
or
gym,
or
teaching
german
or
anything
else.
now
those
may
all
be
bad
things,
but
what
does
that
have
to
be
with
the
eeoa?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
fact
that
you
keep
talking
about
the
district
court
emphasizes
my
concern
about
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
which
is
what
we
are
reviewing.
and
as
i
read
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
they
focused
exclusively
on
incremental
costs
associated
with
ell
programs
and
the
educational
funding
model
that
the
state
had
at
that
time.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
they
say.
they
were
required
--
the
petitioners
were
required
to
demonstrate
either
that
there
are
no
longer
incremental
costs
associated
with
ell
programs
in
arizona
or
that
arizona's
funding
model
was
so
altered
as
to
make
incremental
costs
issue
relevant.
that
was
their
explanation
of
the
holding,
60
--
63a
of
the
speaker's
appendix.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
these
consolidated
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
ninth
circuit.
they
concerned
the
provision
of
english
language
instruction
in
the
arizona
public
schools
and
they
involve
two
provisions
of
federal
law.
the
first
of
these
is
the
equal
educational
opportunities
act
of
1974
the
eeoa.
this
law
contains
a
provision
that
was
enacted
to
make
sure
that
the
states
provide
adequate
english
language
instruction
to
the
students
whose
native
language
is
not
english.
the
statute
is
cast
in
very
broad
language.
all
that
it
says
is
that
a
state
must
take
"appropriate
action"
to
achieve
this
goal
to
teach
english
to
non-english
speaking
students.
the
law
otherwise
leaves
it
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
states
to
decide
how
best
to
provide
english
language
instruction.
the
second
provision
of
federal
law
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
rule
60(b)(5)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
this
rule
allows
a
party
to
ask
a
federal
court
to
grant
relief
from
a
judgement
when
continued
enforcement
of
the
judgment
is
no
longer
in
public
interest.
one
of
our
leading
cases
on
rule
60(b)(5)
is
a
case
called
rufo
versus
inmates
of
suffolk
county
jail
decided
in
1992
and
in
that
case,
we
identified
a
category
of
cases
which
we
termed,
institutional
reform
litigation
in
which
rule
60(b)(5)
may
play
in
a
specially
important
role.
institutional
reform
cases
are
cases
in
which
a
federal
court
in
order
to
remedy
a
violation
of
federal
law,
issues
orders
that
generally
continue
in
effect
for
a
lengthy
period
of
time
and
extend
deeply
into
areas
of
traditional
state
control.
the
orders
issued
in
such
cases
often
served
a
very
important
purpose
but
they
may
present
special
problems.
for
one
thing,
the
orders
tie
the
hands
of
state
and
local
officials
preventing
them
from
responding
to
changed
circumstances
and
new
policy
insights.
in
addition,
there
are
cases
in
which
state
and
local
officials
consent
to
or
do
not
vigorously
contest
the
entry
of
the
orders
because
they
want
to
use
the
federal
court
to
achieve
things
that
they
cannot
achieve
by
attempting
to
persuade
the
state
legislature
or
the
voters.
in
cases
of
this
sort,
rule
60(b)(5)
provides
a
valuable
escape
hatch
that
allows
a
party
to
ask
a
federal
court
to
consider
whether
an
order
has
become
obsolete
or
inappropriate
due
to
changed
circumstances.
the
present
cases
began
in
1992
and
they
originally
concerned
one
school
district
in
arizona,
the
district
of
nogales
which
is
located
along
the
u.s.-mexico
boder.
students
and
parents
sued
under
the
eeoa
claiming
that
the
state
of
arizona
was
not
taking
appropriate
action
to
provide
english
language
instruction
in
nogales.
at
the
time,
the
program
in
nogales
was
bilingual
education
which
means
that
students
who
were
not
fluent
in
english
attended
classes
in
which
they
were
thought
to
speak
and
read
english
but
most
of
their
other
classes
were
conducted
in
spanish.
now,
this
is
some
obviously
required
the
hiring
of
teachers
to
teach
a
variety
of
subjects
in
spanish
as
well
as
teachers
to
teach
english
and
this
meant
that
the
district
had
to
spend
more
money
for
each
student
who
was
not
fluent
in
english
than
it
spent
on
other
students.
the
district
court
found
that
the
nogales
program
was
not
working
primarily
because
the
state
was
not
providing
enough
special
funding
for
the
students
in
the
bilingual
program.
the
court
first
ordered
the
state
to
fix
this
problem,
its
funding
problem
in
nogales
but
it
later
ordered
the
state
to
provide
additional
funding
in
every
other
district
in
the
state.
in
doing
this,
the
court
did
not
find
that
the
eeoa
was
being
violated
in
any
of
these
other
districts.
instead,
the
court
took
these
major
steps
simply
because
the
state
attorney
general
asked
the
court
to
do
so.
the
state
attorney
general
said
that
this
was
required
by
the
state
constitution,
but
she
did
not
take
this
argument
about
state
law
to
the
state
legislature
or
to
the
state
courts.
she
went
to
the
federal
court.
the
federal
court
ordered
the
legislature
to
make
appropriations
and
when
the
legislature
did
not
do
so,
the
court
levied
heavy
fines.
both
the
state
attorney
general
and
the
governor
refused
to
defend
the
position
taken
by
the
legislature
so
legislative
leaders
intervened
and
moved
for
relief
from
the
judgment
under
rule
60(b)(5).
they
argued
that
a
lot
had
changed
since
the
orders
were
originally
entered.
for
one
thing
they
said,
the
state
in
response
to
new
thinking
about
the
best
way
to
teach
english
to
non-english
speaking
students
have
abandoned
bilingual
education
and
adopted
a
new
system
called,
"structured
english
immersion"
which
means
that
the
students
attend
regular
classes
conducted
in
english
while
receiving
additional
special
english
language
instruction.
second,
the
state
had
dramatically
increased
the
general
financial
assistance
that
it
provides
to
school
districts.
and
third,
a
new
school
administration
in
nogales
had
made
important
improvements
in
the
local
schools.
the
district
court
however,
did
not
--
in
our
judgment
adequately
considered
these
changed
circumstances.
instead,
it
continued
to
focus
excessively
on
the
old
issue
of
incremental
funding
and
failed
to
give
proper
consideration
to
the
broader
question
whether
the
state
of
arizona
was
taking
appropriate
action
in
nogales
by
other
means.
on
appeal,
the
ninth
circuit
made
essentially
the
same
error.
we
therefore
reserve
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
this
case
so
that
the
district
court
can
properly
apply
rule
60(b)(5)
and
the
eeoa's
appropriate
action
requirement.
during
the
course
of
the
litigation,
another
issue
has
come
up
that
we
address
in
the
opinion
and
that
is
the
extension
of
the
orders
in
this
case
to
the
entire
state
of
arizona.
we
hold
that
if
this
issue
is
raised
on
remand,
the
district
court
must
determine
whether
there
is
any
basis
in
federal
law
or
in
the
evidence
of
this
case
for
this
dramatic
extension
of
the
original
orders.
in
reaching
these
results,
we
make
it
clear
that
the
state
of
arizona
must
fully
comply
with
federal
law
in
providing
english
language
instruction
to
students
who
have
not
mastered
the
language.
that
is
the
goal
of
the
eeoa
and
it
is
unquestionably
an
important
one.
the
question
here
however,
is
whether
the
remedy
originally
ordered
by
the
district
court
should
remain
in
place
or
whether
petitioners
can
show
that
as
a
result
of
the
changed
circumstances
they
cite
relief
from
the
order
should
be
granted.
