mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
failure-to-report
escape
qualifies
as
a
violent
felony
under
the
acca's
residual
clause
because
it
creates
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
that's
comparable
in
both
kind
and
degree
to
the
risk
that's
created
by
the
enumerated
offense
of
burglary.
failure-to-report
escape
is
similar
in
kind
to
burglary
because
it's
purposeful,
violent,
and
aggressive
in
the
same
way
as
burglary.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
two
points
on
that.
first,
escape
and
failure-to-report
escape,
other
types
of
escape
and
recapture,
are
linked
ed
in
a
way
that
arrest
and
the
typical
crime
aren't,
because
escape
inherently
avoids
--
inherently
involves
the
avoidance
of
custody
and
custody
is
the
very
obligation
that
recapture
is
trying
to
impose.
but
avoiding
arrest
isn't
an
element
of
the
typical
crime,
so
the
connection
between
arrest
and
the
ordinary
crime
isn't
close
enough
to
justify
considering
the
violence
in
arrest
--
in
the
arrest
in
whether
the
crime
is
violent.
also
the
risk--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--okay.
what
i'm
saying
is
it's
an
element
of
escape
that
you're
avoiding
custody,
and
escape
is
a
continuing
offense
and
so
it
doesn't
end
until
the
avoidance
of
custody
is
over.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
shows
the
close
connection
between
the
two.
and
so
when
you're
--
when
the
offender
is
committing
the
crime,
it's
appropriate
to
hold
him
accountable
for
what
he
can
see
is
so
highly,
closely
connected
to
the
crime
and
which,
in
fact,
has
to
happen
in
order
to
end
the
crime;
whereas--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--to
address
the
--
the
passive
point,
deliberately
failing
to
comply
with
your
legal
duty
to
report
to
prison
is
not
--
it
is
not
doing
nothing,
as
petitioner
says.
it's
not
purely
passive.
it
is
a
criminal
act.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's
purposefully
inviting
the
violent
confrontation
when
the
law
enforcement
officers
come
to
terminate--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no.
because
in
--
in
failure
to
respond
to
the
traffic
ticket
the
--
first
of
all,
it's
not
clear
that
somebody
is
going
to
come
after
you
and
try
to
physically
bring
you
in.
second
of
all,
the
offender
isn't
expecting
them
and
on
edge
and
prone
to
react
violently.
third,
he
hasn't
demonstrated
already
that
he
is
unwilling
to
submit
to
custody.
and
the
fact
that--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no.
i'm
saying
just
the
opposite
of
that.
i'm
saying
that
it's
different
because
here
you've
got
somebody
who
is
expecting
the
police
to
come.
he
is
looking
over
his
shoulder
all
the
time.
he
knows
they
know
he
didn't
come
to
prison.
he
knows
they
know
who
he
is.
they
probably
know
where
he
is.
if
he
is
sitting
at
home,
they
know
where
he
is.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
this--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--this
offense
that
he
was
convicted
of
is
failure
to
report
to
a
penal
institution,
failure
to
report
to
prison.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
a
probation
violation
is
different
--
different
circumstances.
it
doesn't
involve
the
same
refusal
to
submit
to
custody
that
this
offense
involves,
which--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
don't
think
you
really
need
the
statistics,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
a
common
--
it's
common
sense
that
the
police
are
going
to
make
vigorous
efforts
to
recapture
people
who
fail
to
show
up
to
prison
the
way
they
are
supposed
to.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--when
he
was
sentenced
--
when
he
was
convicted
of
escape,
he
was
sentenced
to
six
months
in
prison
--
in
jail,
that
was
stayed;
probation
for
30
months,
and
he
violated
his
probation
and
he
ended
up
in
jail
for
5
years.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
he
didn't
just
have
to
make
up
the
weekends
that
he
had
lost.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
know
that,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
but
i
don't
think
that's
accurate
for
the
sentence
for
escape.
on
page
113
to
114
of
this
ja,
your
honor,
which
is
the
--
the
psr
describing
what
happened
for
this
offense,
it
says
that
he
has
30
months
probation.
it's
in
the
second
volume,
the
volume
under
seal.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
you
know,
we
are
not
supposed
to
be
looking
at
the
individual
offender
here.
it's
the
categorical
approach.
but
he
had
been
convicted
of
robbery
and
aggravated
battery,
your
honor.
so
he
--
he
is
not
somebody
who
has
not
done
any
violent
crimes,
either.
and
what's
--
what's
different
is
that
he
has
now
deliberately
failed
to
comply
with
his
legal
duty
to
report.
he
has
now
deliberately
resisted
custody,
so--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--first
of
all,
while
he
is
out
on
the
binge,
people
could
be
coming
and
looking
for
him
and
the
violent
confrontation
could
occur.
second
of
all,
even
if
in
the
unusual
case
of
somebody
who
comes
in
voluntarily
hours
late,
a
few
days
late,
there
wasn't
a
--
a
risk
of
--
of
violence,
which
we
think
there
can
be,
but
even
if
there
was
none,
it
wouldn't
matter
because
you're
applying
the
categorical
approach
here.
and
what
you
don't
look
at
--
you
don't
look
at
the
unusual
case.
you
look
at
the
elements
of
the
offense
in
the
ordinary
case.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
generally
the
policy--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
your
honor,
he
is
--
he
is
looking
at
his
whole--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
think
generally
that
--
that
they
look
at
the
conduct
that's
been
committed
and
they
--
that
the
policy
is
to
charge
the
--
the
maximum
charges
that
are
supported
by
what
the
--
what
the
defendant
has
done.
but
here
you
don't
have--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i'm
--
i'm
not
aware
of
that.
i
can't
--
can't
speak
to
the
--
the
fact
that
they
would
do
that,
your
honor.
but
here
you've
got
in
the
acca,
you're
got
not
one
previous
violation
for
escape;
you've
got
three
violent
felonies
that
you
have
to
have.
and
this
was
his
third
one
with
--
in
addition
to
robbery
and
aggravated
battery
and
in
addition
to
distributing
cocaine
within
a
thousand
feet
of
public
housing.
and
so
we
are
not
talking
about--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that's
--
that's
also
incorrect,
your
honor.
two
of
the
four
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
--
in
our
brief,
in
our
anecdotes,
involved
injury
to
innocent
bystanders.
it's
true
we
didn't
highlight
that
in
the
parentheticals
to
those
cases,
but
it's
on
page
19,
the
--
we
cite
various
cases,
and
we
also
then
go
on
to
cite
some
articles
just
as
an
example.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
we
have
those
two
examples.
i
mean,
i
haven't
gone
out
and
looked
for
other
cases.
those
are
just
two
out
of
the
four
that
we
cited.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
in
--
in
addition
to
those,
no.
i
--
i
went
to
get
some
sample
cases.
i
haven't
gone
to
see
if
i
could
find
more
cases
of
those.
in
addition,
in
the
massachusetts
data
there
are
--
there
are
two
of
the
18.
admittedly,
the
sample
is
small
in
massachusetts--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--but
it's
11
percent
of
the
people
violently
resisted,
and
they
were
charged
with
assault
and
battery
on
a
police
officer.
i
think
that
that's
indicative
of
possible
injury.
and
in
any
case
the
question
is--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
the
sentencing
commission
data
also
supports
--
although,
again,
the
--
the
sample
size
is
small.
but
the
question
here
is:
is
there
a
potential
risk?
and
what
the
sentencing
data
shows
for
the
failure-to-report
escapees
is
that
7.1--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--we
don't
think
that
you
should
be
looking
at
the
statistics
at
--
at
all,
your
honor.
but
--
and
so
--
i
mean,
you
know,
that's
our
--
our
fundamental
point
is
that
--
that
the
acca
requires
a
potential
risk.
the
james
case
illustrates
that
you
decide
these
cases
without
statistics.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
what
james
says
is
that
you
try
to
assess
whether
the
degree
of
risk
is
comparable
to
the
degree
of
risk
presented
by
one
of
the
enumerated
offenses.
and,
as
you
did
in
james--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i'm
not
saying
that
you
should
ignore
the
statistics,
but
the
statistics
are
neither
necessary
nor
dispositive.
and
i
don't
think
the
statistics
cast
any
doubt
on
the
commonsense
conclusion
based
on
some
of
the
factors
i
was
talking
about
before,
about
why
there's
a
potential
for
violence
during--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
i
think
james
addresses
that,
your
honor.
and
james
says
that
in
deciding
whether
you
have
a
serious
potential,
you
look
to
the
enumerated
offenses
and
you
determine
if
they
can
be
comparable.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
has
--
it
has
to
be
more
than
a
potential.
it
has
to
be
serious
in
the
sense
that
it's
similar
in
degree,
comparable
in
degree,
to
one
of
the
enumerated
offenses.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
okay.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that's
right.
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it's
a
3.1
percent
--
3.1
percent
rate
of
having
this
dangerous
weapon
when
he
is
being
--
being
taken
into
custody
for
--
for
this
offense.
and,
you
know,
looking
at
the
--
at
the
failure-to-report
people,
which
is
what
this
person
is
charged
of,
of
those
42
people,
that
was
7.1
percent
of
those
people
that
had
a
weapon.
and
if
one
of
those
people
had
used
that
weapon,
that
would
have
been
a
2.4
percent
chance
of
injury.
now,
i'm
saying
the
sample
size
is
small,
and
this
shows
why
it's
dangerous
to
put
too
much
weight
on
it.
but
that
would
have
been
a
2.4
percent
rate
of
injury.
and
in
tennessee
v.
garner,
this
court
cited
a
statistic
in
the
1970s
about
the
risk
of
violence
during
burglary.
and
this
was
household
burglary,
which
you
think
might
be
likely--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
no,
your
honor.
and
i'm
not
criticizing
it.
i'm
saying
that
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
sample
size
and
you
have
to
take
into
account
that
there
are--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--because
my
point
is
that
--
take
the
42
failure-to-report
people,
which
is
the
offense
here,
okay.
three
of
them
--
three
of
those
42,
had
guns.
if
one
of
those
three
had
used
the
gun,
that
would
have
been
a
use
of
force,
an
instance
of
actual
violence.
that
percentage
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
questioning
the
statistical
validity
of
anything.
i'm
taking
it
on
its
terms.
that's
a
2.4
percent
statistic
there.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
3.8
percent
in
--
in
household
burglary.
so
i
just
think
that
--
that
the
statistics
are
--
are
very
low,
the
risk
of
actual
violence
in
burglary
as
well.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
your
honor,
the
statute
again
talks
about
the
potential
risk.
it
doesn't
talk
about
the
actual
use
of
force
or
the
actual
injury.
the
actual
use
of
force
is
covered
by
clause
one--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no.
but
i
think
the
drunk
driving
--
that
what
concerned
the
court
about
drunk
driving
was
that
the
crime
is
a
strict
liability
crime.
it
didn't
involve
deliberate
conduct.
this
conduct
is
purposeful.
petitioner
doesn't
--
doesn't
contest
that.
and
the
situation
here
is
a
different
kind
of
risk.
it's
like
the
risk
in
burglary.
it's
the
deliberate
commission
of
the
crime
despite
the
clear
risk
of
an
ensuing
violent
confrontation.
and
so,
the
parallel,
there
really
isn't
a
parallel
to
the
strict
liability
crime
there,
where
the
injury
--
the
court
said
in
begay
there
is
a
serious
risk
of
injury.
the
problem
is
that
the
crime
is
just
not
purposeful,
so
it
doesn't
show
this
willingness
to
harm
others.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
but
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
talk
about
the
violent
conduct
in
context.
and
what
it
said
is
that
all
these
enumerated
crimes
are
violent
crimes.
but
burglary
is
violent
not
because
the
violence
is
some
element
of
the
offense.
there
is
nothing
about
the
elements
of
the
offense
that's
violent.
what
makes
burglary
violent
is
the
fact
that
the
offender
deliberately
commits
it,
even
though
he
knows
it
could
trigger
this
violent
confrontation.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
it's
--
it's
numerous
things,
but
the
avoidance
of
custody
is
sort
of
a
categorical
difference
between
this
and
all
the
other
crimes,
your
honor.
it's
an
element
of
this
crime
that
he
is
doing
that.
that
also
factors
into
the
fact
that
the
risk
of
violence
during
recapture
is
going
to
be
greater
than
the
risk
of
violence
in
apprehending
an
ordinary
criminal
for
several
different
related
reasons.
one--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
the
seventh
circuit
thought
that
applying
the
purposeful,
violent
and
aggressive
requirement
of
begay
required
a
different
result
because
it
--
it
thought
that
it
meant
that
the
crime
had
to
involve
violent
conduct
itself;
and
it
didn't
appreciate
the
point
i
was
making
before,
that
burglary
doesn't
involve
that
violent
conduct
itself,
and
that
burglary
is
violent
because
of
the
prospect
of
the
violent
confrontation.
and
so,
that's
the
--
that's
what
led
the
seventh
circuit
astray
the
second
time
around.
but
it--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
they
did
ask
for
--
for
statistics.
but
i
would
stress
again
why
we
think
that
--
that
looking
to
statistics
as
some
kind
of
a
requirement
is,
you
know,
both
perilous
and
not
required
by
the
statute:
one,
because
the
statute
requires
just
potential
risk,
not
actual
injury.
two,
because
these
data
are
just
generally
not
going
to
be
available.
and
you
don't
have
even
the
baseline
for
the
other
crimes,
the
enumerated
crimes,
really
to
compare
it
to.
and
so
the
result,
if
you
start
looking
around
for
statistics
and
saying
we
need
these
statistics
to
do
it,
is
that
virtually
no
crimes
are
going
to
qualify
under
the
residual
clause.
and
obviously,
that
isn't
what
congress
intended
when
it
adopted
this
broad
residual
clause.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
what
--
we
wouldn't
sweep
in
any
crimes
based
on
arrest
if
the
crimes
don't
themselves
involve
as
part
of
the
crime
the
avoidance
of
custody,
because
that
shows
the
close
link
between
the
crime
that
i
was
explaining
before.
that's
sort
of
the
categorical
difference,
although
i
would
agree
with
you,
certainly,
that
in
white-collar
crimes
in
many
cases
the
offender
is
going
to
submit
voluntarily
to
custody;
they
are
not
even
going
to
come
after
him.
and
he
hasn't
done
anything
to
show
his
likelihood
to
resist
in
any
way,
and
so
there
is
going
to
be
a
significantly
less
connection
there.
violent
crimes
where
you
might
think
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
higher
incidence
are
going
to
be
covered
based
on
the
violence
of
the
crime,
anyway.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
right.
they
are
going
to
be
covered
already.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
so
you
know,
one,
we
think
there
is
a
categorical
difference
between
this
kind
of
crime
which
has
as
an
element
avoidance
custody,
and
all
of
the
ordinary
crimes
that
you're
talking
about.
but
even
if
you
go
and
set
that
aside
and
don't
draw
that
categorical
line,
and
you
look
at,
well,
what's
the
risk
of
violence,
here
what
you've
got
is
you've
got
you
know
that
they
are
going
to
come
after
him;
he
knows
they
are
coming;
he
is
already
deliberately,
he
has
already
indicated
his
unwillingness
to
submit
to
custody;
they
know
that;
so
they
come
prepared
for
resistance.
and
in
illinois
he
is
by
definition
a
recidivist
felon
if
he
has
committed
this
crime,
and
those
are
characteristics
that
are
particularly
indicative
of
dangerousness.
so
we
think
this
sets
it
quite
apart
from
other
crimes
in
terms
of
the
risk
of
violence
that
--
that
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
not
--
you
know,
how
many
could
be
covered
altogether?
or--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well
i'm
hopeful
that
the
court
won't
have
to
decide
too
many
other
cases
with
the
guidance
that
will
be
given
by
begay
and
james
and
now
--
and
now
this
case.
so,
you
know,
it
has
been
--
this
case,
the
court
took;
it
had
been
holding
the
case
for
begay
and
it
took
it
rather
than
vacating
and
remanding.
so
it's
not
as
if
this
is
a
case
where
some
conflict
has
developed
after
the
court
was
taken
to
resolve.
we
think--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
think
a
soldier
that
goes
awol
--
i
mean,
the
soldier
that
goes
awol
does
probably
invite
somebody
to
come
after
them.
it's
a
little
bit
harder
case
here
because
he
is
not
somebody
who
is
a
recidivist
felon.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
when
he
did
it
first
--
he
could
have
done
it
in
his
first
crime.
so
you
don't
know
when
did
this
that
he
had
the
other
two
counting
under
the
acca.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
you
don't
look
to
the
individual
person;
we're
looking
to
the
ordinary
case
and
we
know
from
the
elements
here
that
you
have
a
recidivist
--
you
have
a
recidivist
felon.
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
risk
of
--
you
know,
there
is
a
risk
of
violent
confrontation
when
a
soldier
goes
awol,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
just
don't
think
it's
quite
as
--
as
clear
a
risk
as
it
is
--
as
it
is
here,
but
you
know,
i
would
have
to
say
that
there
is
some
risk.
yes.
the
--
if
i
could
just
address
something
that
justice
kennedy
had
raised
before
about
statutes
unlike
illinois's
statute
that
has
a
--
that
generally
prohibit
escape.
one
--
one
possible
problem
that
could
arise
from
a
holding
that
offenses
like
failure
to
report
are
not
violent
felonies
is
that
a
statute
that
broadly
covered
escape,
the
result
would
be
that
jail
break
escapes
would
not
be
violent
felonies
under
that
statute,
because
the
statistics
that
are
out
there
suggest
that
89
percent
of
all
escapes
are
either
walkaways
or
failure
to
report.
and
so
unless
the
charging
document
specifically
charged
it
as
a
jail
break
escape,
then
the
general
--
something
that
was
charged
under
the
general
escape
statute
would
not
qualify
for
coverage
under
the
acca.
and
aside
from
that,
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
could
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
