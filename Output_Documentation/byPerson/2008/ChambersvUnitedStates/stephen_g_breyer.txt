what
one
are
we
to
do
with
--
justice
stevens
--
i
think
you
should
address
the
statistics
in
the
sentencing
report.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i
read
them,
they
put
together
--
if
you
put
together
failing
to
report
and
failing
to
return,
you
get
160
cases
in
their
sample.
and
the
number
of
those
cases,
whether
you
looked
at
the
time
when
he
had
left
or
whether
you
looked
at
the
time
he
was
apprehended,
in
which
force
was
involved
is
zero.
the
number
of
cases
in
which
injury
was
involved
is
zero.
the
number
of
cases
where
he
had
a
dangerous
weapon
is
five.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
now
there
we
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
had
every
opportunity,
when
we
have
160
cases
out
of
the
universe
--
i
guess
i
don't
know
what
the
universe
is,
but
sampling
proceeds
through
a
small
amount
of
cases.
and
you
could,
of
course,
criticize
the
sentencing
commission
effort
if
you
have
the
statistician
or
someone
who
will
tell
us
that
that
sampling
was
not
an
appropriate
method
to
proceed.
is
there
any
such
person?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
why
--
that
was
my
question.
why
take
into
account
the
sample
size
in
the
absence
of
a
statistician
who
would
tell
us
that
the
sample
size
is
too
small
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
commission
reaches?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
deondery
chambers,
who
was
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
was
convicted
of
a
--
of
a
gun
crime
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
gun
illegally
to
a
federal
crime
and
there's
an
act
called
the
armed
career
criminal
act
which
says
that
a
person
who
is
convicted
of
that,
if
he
has
three
prior
convictions
for
certain
drug
crimes
or
violent
felonies,
will
get
a
mandatory
minimum
of
15
years
sentence.
now,
the
question
here
is
you
look
back
at
the
three
prior
convictions,
so
he
has
several
prior
convictions,
and
this
case
turns
on
whether
one
of
those
prior
convictions
which
is
contested
as
to
whether
it's
a
violent
felony.
is
it
a
violent
felony
or
isn't
it
a
violent
felony?
and
the
particular
conviction
in
question
is
in
fact
has
to
do
with
his
punishment
for
another
conviction,
so
he
has
a
quite
a
few
convictions.
but
this
particular
time,
he's
convicted
of
a
state
crime
and
he
was
sentence
to
weekends
in
prison
and
he
didn't
show
up
for
four
of
the
weekends
and
so
they
convicted
him
of
that,
of
failing
to
report
for
prison.
and
the
question
is,
is
that
crime,
a
failing
to
report
for
prison,
a
violent
felony
within
the
meaning
of
the
armed
career
criminal
act?
but
there
are
several
definitions
here
but
the
one
that
significantly
matters
here
is
the
following,
is
a
violent
felony
if
the
conviction
is
for
a
crime
that
it
is
burglary,
arson
or
extorsion
involves
the
use
of
explosives
or
otherwise
involves
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
we
can
get
rid
of
the
few
of
this.
it's
not
burglary,
it's
not
arson,
not
extorsion,
it
doesn't
involve
the
use
of
explosives.
but
the
question
is,
does
it
present
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another?
now,
the
lower
courts
thought
it
did
but
i
think,
we
think,
that
the
reason
they
thought
that
is
because
they
lumped
it
together
with
a
general
crime
called
escape
because
all
these
things
escape
from
prisons,
escape
from
custody,
failure
to
report
for
prison,
failure
to
report
for
home
confinement,
the
variety
of
things
are
all
contained
in
the
same
subsection
of
a
single
illinois
provision.
well
that
--
that
is
so,
but
nonetheless,
we
think
that
several
of
these
cover
separate
crimes.
and
in
particular
escape
is
one
crime
for
purposes
of
this
sentencing
thing
and
a
failure
to
report
is
another
crime
and
we
just
look
at
that
failure
to
report.
and
once
we
look
at
that,
we
think
it's
not
that
difficult,
we
treat
it
as
a
crime
differently
from
escape.
and
when
we
asked
the
question,
does
the
failure
to
report
involved
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
we
think
the
answer
has
to
be
no.
the
conducted
issue
is
more
likely
to
consist
of
just
inaction,
not
action.
there
is
no
convincing
evidence
that
these
kinds
of
people
who
don't
report
for
prison,
even
when
they're
apprehended,
are
more
dangerous
than
other
suspects
who
were
on
the
loose.
and
indeed
here,
the
united
states
sentencing
commission
studied
the
subject
prepare
to
report
and
their
report,
they
identified
every
federal
case
in
2006
and
2007
that
was
sentence
under
a
particular
provision
called
escape,
instigating
or
assisting
escape
and
they
took
those
where
there
was
a
pre-sentence
reports
so
you
could
find
out
what
really
happened.
they
looked
at
414
cases
that
fell
into
this
particular
category
and
a
160
of
them
involved
failures
to
report.
so,
among
other
things,
they
said,
well,
let's
look
at
those
failures
to
report.
did
any
of
them
involve
violence?
and
the
answer
was
no,
not
one
of
them.
they
didn't
involve
violence
during
the
commission
of
the
offense
even
they
failed
to
report,
nor
did
they
involve
violence
when
he
was
later
apprehended.
and
the
government
has
provided
some
information
as
the
contrary
but
not
very
much.
so,
we
conclude
there
is
no
risk
here,
not
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
we
hold
that
and
we
reverse
the
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
was
to
the
contrary.
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
