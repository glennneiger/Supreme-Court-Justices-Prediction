justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
roberts,
have
you
had
occasion
to
look
at
the
--
the
recent
figures
compiled
by
the
sentencing
commission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
magnitude
of
the
risk
relevant?
suppose
it
happens
one
out
of
10,000
times
or
99
out
of
100
times.
are
they
different
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
those
statistics
show
a
greater
danger
than
the
dangers
from
drunk
driving
that
were
involved
in
begay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roberts,
i'm
sorry;
do
you
think
a
soldier
who
is
awol
commits
a
violent
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
has
to
be
a
recidivist.
this
is
one
of
three
offenses
for
an
aggravated
sentence.
you
never
have
the
isolated
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
only
be
a
crime
if
it's
his
third
crime
and
not
if
it's
his
first.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
