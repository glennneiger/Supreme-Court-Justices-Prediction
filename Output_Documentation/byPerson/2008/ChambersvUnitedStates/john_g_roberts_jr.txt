chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-11206,
chambers
v.
united
states.
mr.
hochman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
take
it
you
concede
that
a
breakout
as
opposed
to
a
failure
to
report
would
be
covered
by
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
--
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
his
mouth,
but
i
thought
what
justice
kennedy
was
asking
is
what
if
you
have
a
statute
that
is
just
escape
or
whatever
and
doesn't
break
it
down
like
that?
at
that
point
would
we
look
to
see
what
the
crime
of
escape
was
typically
like,
most
of
them
were
breakout
or
most
of
them
were
the
other
thing?
you
have,
i
gather,
two
separate
provisions,
but
what
if
you
don't?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
if
that's
the
case,
i'm
looking
at
720
illinois
statutes
5/31-6.
it's
reproduced
a
page
2a
of
the
government's
brief.
and
they
don't
--
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
separate
provision,
whether
it's
a
breakout
or
a
failure
to
report.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
invading
someone's
space,
so
trespass
would
be
covered
by
this
statute?
you're
invading
someone's
space.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
offender
is
prone
to
react
violently
if
he
doesn't
respond
to
a
traffic
ticket?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
illinois
statute?
it
is,
i
take
it,
only
triggered
by
failure
to
report
for
confinement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
like,
you
know,
you've
got
to
see
your
probation
officer
every--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
you
concede
the
probation
or
parole
situation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
need
not
so
many
--
not
so
much
statistics
about
how
many
times
violence
results,
but
statistics
about
how
serious
the
police
are
about
picking
somebody
up?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understood
your
friend
--
excuse
me.
i
understood
your
friend
to
say
that
you
don't
have
a
single
example
of
failure
to
report
leading
to
a
violent
confrontation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
have
--
so
you
have
two
examples.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
haven't
gone
out
and
looked
for
other
--
i'm
sorry.
you
haven't
gone
out
and
looked
for
other
cases?
i
thought
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
counsel.
one
of
my
colleagues
was
trying
to
ask
a
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hochman,
you
have
11
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
statistics
show
that
the
number
of
robberies
increases
during
the
holiday
season.
he
just
needed
to
get
----
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
is
no
indication
he
meant
to
spend
time
with
his
family
over
the
holidays.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
today
in
case
06-11206,
chambers
versus
united
states.
