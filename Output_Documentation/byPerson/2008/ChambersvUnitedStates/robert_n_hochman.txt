mr.
robert
n.
hochman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
failure
to
report
is
not
a
violent
felony
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act
because
it
presents
neither
a
serious
potential
risk
of
injury
to
others
nor
involves
violent
and
aggressive
conduct.
the
government
argues
that
failure
to
report
satisfies
both
the
risk
of
injury
and
violent,
aggressive
conduct
standards
for
the
same
reason:
the
prospect
that
a
offender
will
violently
resist
an
arrest
--
resist
arrest
upon
completion
of
the
offense
or
upon
--
for
having
done
the
offense.
that
potential
and
that
potential
risk
alone
is
neither
as
a
matter
of
fact
nor
law
sufficient
to
satisfy
either
the
risk
of
injury
or
the
violent,
aggressive
conduct
standard.
beginning
with
the
risk
of
injury:
the
statute
refers
to
a
serious
potential
risk
of
injury,
and
by
using
the
word
"serious"
congress
indicated
not
just
any
felony,
not
just
any
felony
which
carries
necessarily
some
risk
of
injury
would
be
included.
the
risk
that
must
be
generated
must
be
one
that's
somehow
greater
than,
something
that
warrants
singly
out
this
sort
of
offender
as
the
sort
of
person
who's
deserving
of
greater
punishment
for
his
recidivism.
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would.
i
think
that
in
fact
one
of
the
critical
errors
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
made
and
that
the
government
made
here
is
equating
breakout,
prison
escape,
with
failure
to
report.
they
are
entirely
different.
they
are
importantly
different,
both
again
as
a
matter
of
analytically
the
categorical
rule
and
what
would
you
look
at
to
determine
whether
this
sort
of
person
satisfied
the
violent
and
aggressive
standard.
and
we
now
know,
in
light
of
the
sentencing
commission's
report
that
was
filed
just
last
--
that
was
filed
with
the
court
just
last
week,
that
the
risk
of
injury
associated
with
a
prison
breakout
escape
and
failure
to
report
is
dramatically
different.
and
that
mistake--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--this
case?
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
well,
since
--
i
think
since
this
is
not
a
prison
breakout
case,
i
don't
know
whether
data
about
breakouts--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--i
think
you
--
i
think
the
categorical
rule
does
require
you
to
look
at--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--i
think
in
your
hypothetical,
where
a
prison
breakout
--
where
a
prison
breakout
is
involved--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--i
don't
think
that
you
look
to
the
universe
under
the
escape
statute.
you
can
under
shepard--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--but
the
issue
under
shepard
and
the
approach
under
the
categorical
rule
requires
you
--
allows
you
to
look
at
a
narrower
subsection
of
the
statute
if
the
charging
document
and
other
reliable
indicia
indicate
that.
and
in
this
case,
it's
undisputed
that
mr.
chambers
was
convicted
only
of
failing
to
report.
he
was
not
convicted
of
the
more
serious
offense
of
prison
breakout.
and
in
fact
in
illinois
they
are
punished
at
different
levels,
and
the
evidence
is
absolutely
clear--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--yes.
and
that
--
that
is
a
difficult
question
under
the
categorical
rule.
i
think
that
the
first
step
would
be
to
determine
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
record.
under
shepard,
you
can
look
to
other
indications
of
whether
the
conduct
at
issue
that
was
found
by
the
jury
or
that
was
pled
to,
either
from
an
indictment
or
from
plea
colloquy,
whether
there
is
some
more
specific
indication.
if
not,
i
think
then
what
you
would
look
at
--
and
i
think
here
you
would
look
at,
to
the
extent
you're
looking
at
the
risk
--
on
the
risk
of
injury
side,
you
would
look
at
the
best
available
information.
if
that
--
if
that
gives
you
a
run
of
cases
where
you
say
typically--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--but
here
the
charging
document
was
clear,
and
under
shepard
the
charging
document
is
something
you're
also
allowed
to
take
into
consideration.
and
there
is
no
doubt,
under
the
charging
document,
that
he
was
convicted
of
merely
failing
to
report.
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
it
--
the
sentence
appears
that
they
extended
his
probation.
he
had
to
serve
the
four
weekends
that
he
had
failed
--
for
which
he
had
failed
to
report,
and
his
probation
was
extended.
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
he
did
not
get
any
additional
jail
time
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
i
think
this
--
i
think
this
court
took
that
step
in
shepard,
and
it
did
it
in
a
very
narrow
and
circumscribed
way.
it
did
it
by
saying
the
only
things
you're
allowed
to
consider
are
things
that
are
as
reliable
as
the
charge
itself
and
the
elements
essential
to--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--if
the
jury
instructions
were
clear,
if
it's
clear
that
the
jury
had
to
find
that
the
presence
of
a
firearm
--
and
i
think
it
complicates
--
that
is,
i
think
some
courts
refer
to
it
as
the
modified
categorical
rule.
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
if
--
if
--
correct.
if
it's
not
an
element
in
the
sense
that
he
either
pled
to
it
or
the
jury
necessarily
found
it
as
a
necessary
matter.
and
that's
really
what
shepard
says.
it
has
to
be
something
that
we
necessarily
know
occurred
from
the
fact
of
conviction,
and--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--i
don't
think
that
shepard
permits
you
to
look
into
trial
transcripts
of
evidence
that
was
presented.
it
just
says:
what
did
the
jury
necessarily
find?
and
what
i
mean
by
"jury
instructions",
how
was
the
jury
instructed?
what
did
it
have
to
find?
what
did
the
jury
have
to
find
in
order
to
convict?
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
i
think
it
is
elements,
but
if
you
look--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--please,
continue.
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
i
think
there
are
two
problems
with
that
approach,
your
honor:
first,
as
the
court
said
in
shepard,
the
categorical
rule,
which
was
adopted
way
back
when
the
court
first
confronted
the
statute
and
has
been
consistently
applied
ever
since,
more
or
less
anticipated
the
sixth
amendment
apprendi
concerns
that
might
come
from
digging
in
and
trying
to
attribute
conduct
which
has
not
been
found
by
a
jury,
which
doesn't
have
that
level
of
reliability,
whether
it's
an
element
or
was
on
a
special
verdict
form
or
some
--
or
some
other
--
or
was
admitted
to
in
a
plea
colloquy.
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
well,
if
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
then
i
think
under
shepard
it's
something
that
could
be
considered,
and
that
would
be
part
of
what's
referred
to
as
the
modified
categorical
approach.
i
think
the
problems
with
the
categorical
approach
that
you're
identifying,
courts
have
tried
and
shepard
itself
in
effect
amended
enough
to
provide
some
kind
of
flexibility.
the
other
reason
to
hold
back
on
such
a
sea
change
is
this
is,
after
all,
a
statutory
case
and
the
categorical
rule
has
been
this
court's
approach
from
the
beginning.
congress
could
easily
revise
the
statute.
if
after
20
years
it
hasn't--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--i
think
that
would
make
everybody's
job,
the
bar
and
this
court,
much
easier.
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
that
might
be
the
case,
although
if
it
just
said
"escape",
i
think
i'd
actually
have
a
substantially
harder
case
than
what
we
have
here,
because
what
we
have
here
doesn't
resemble
the
kind
of
violent,
aggressive
conduct
that
this
court
in
begay
said
is
going
to
be
the
standard
and
exemplar
of
the
sort
of
conduct
that
congress
was
thinking
about.
it
added
--
this
court
in
begay
said
that
the
serious
potential
risk
of
injury
is
just
one
part
of
the
inquiry,
that
congress
was
also
singling
out
crimes
commit
ted
in
a
certain
way,
and
if
that,
if
that
requirement
is
going
to
have
any
bite,
if
it's
going
to
do
the
job
of
singling
out
and
separating
out
cases,
it
has
to
be
something
beyond
the
mere
routine,
ever-present
prospect
that
an
offender
might
resist
arrest
for
having
committed
the
offense
after
police
discover
that
he
has
done
so.
and
in
fact
if
you
step
back
for
a
moment
and
just
visualize--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--there
is
no
doubt.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
prospect--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--well
in
the
--
i
actually
think
robbery
would
satisfy
under
the
first
clause
because
it
has
as
an
element
the
use,
attempted
use,
or
threatened
use
of
physical
force
against
another.
but
i
think
the
concern
that
escape
is
much
more
easily
detected
than
other
crimes
is
obviously
true.
and
so
the
prospect
that
the
offender
will
be
arrested
is
obviously
greater
than
in
other,
in
other
crimes.
but
the
point
is
the
standards,
the
standard
imposed
by
begay
and
the
notion
that
the
conduct
must
be
violent
and
aggressive,
if
you
step
back
and
visualize
what
it
is
about
burglary,
arson,
extortion
or
the
use
of
explosives
that
can
properly
be
characterized
as
violent
and
aggressive,
surely
it
is
not
the
prospect
that
an
offender
will
have
been
found
out
for
having
committed
those
offenses,
police
will
be
dispatched
to
arrest
them,
and
then
the
offender
upon
that
confrontation
will
violently
resist
arrest.
it's
just
--
it's
not,
it's
not
what
those
enumerated
offenses
are
doing
in
the
statute.
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
i
think
the
reason
is
because--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--i
assume
that--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--i
think,
justice
souter,
has
it
exactly
right.
i
think
the
reason
why
the
court
in
begay
and
taylor,
by
the
way,
singled
out
burglary
as
having
some
kind
of
inherent
danger
and
potential
for
violent
and
aggressive
conduct
associated
with
it
is
because
it
involves
an
act
of
invading
the
space
of
another,
and
cultural
expectations
and
even
common
law
expectations
about
how
others
might
respond
suggest
that
that
scenario
that
you
have
willingly
created,
knowing
full
well
that
another
might
respond
violently
to
what
you've
done
in
the
event
you've
been
detected--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--what
it
--
what
it
requires
is
the
conscious
creation
of
circumstances
that
you
have
good
reason
to
believe
is
going
to
ignite
in
violence.
and
if
we
learned
anything
from
the
data
that's
been
submitted
to
the
court
both
by
the
sentencing
commission
and
by
the
government,
it's
that
there
is
very
little
reason
to
believe
that
even
the
distant
arrest
scenario
for
those
who
fail
to
report
doesn't
carry
with
it
very
much
of
a
risk
of
injury
at
all.
in
fact,
in
all
the
materials
that
have
been
submitted
to
this
court,
there
is
not
a
single
cited
instance
or
case
of
an
innocent
bystander
or
a
police
officer
who
has
been
injured
in
connection
with
a
confrontation
from
arrest
for
failure
to
report.
there
are
none.
now
to
be
sure,
there
are
some
instances
of
violent
confrontation
and
i'm
not
here
saying
it's
impossible
that
there
would
be
injury
associated
with
an
arrest
scenario.
the
point
is
it's
nothing
different.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
give
us
any
reason
to
believe
this
is
the
kind
of
special
violent
conduct
that
congress
was
singling
out
for
special
treatment.
i
should
also
add
that
excluding
failure
to
report
from
the
statute
isn't
going
to
create
any
kind
of
crack
through
which
the
sort
of
people
the
government
appears
to
be
concerned
about
might
fall
through.
and
the
reason
it
this.
the
several
anecdotal
cases
they
cite
in
their
brief
and
a
couple
of
the
cases
that
massachusetts
reported
back
to
them
which
had
involved
some
kind
of
violent
resisting
arrest,
those
individuals
were
charged,
separately
charged
for
assault
and
battery
and
similar
crimes
on
a
police
officer.
it's
unsurprising
that
when
that
happens,
those
individuals
will
be
separately
charged
and
convicted
for
their
violent
conduct.
so
the
only
work
that
is
done
by
sweeping
away
the
categorical
rule,
doing
serious
damage
to
the
categorical
rule,
undermining
begay,
the
only
work
that's
done
is
to
encompass
people
who
we
have
reason
to
believe
didn't
engage
in
violent
conduct.
that
seems
to
me
a
strange
way
to
interpret
the
statute,
certainly
not
the
sort
of
things
this
court
would
want
to
close
its
eyes
to.
the
last
thing,
your
honors.
it's
important
to
preserve
the
distinction
in
begay
between
the
violent
and
aggressive
standard
on
the
one
hand
and
the
risk
of
injury
on
the
other
hand,
and
government's
approach
collapses
them.
the
government
says,
why
is
this
violent
and
aggressive?
because
in
their
view
we
can
--
falsely,
as
we've
discussed,
but
because
in
their
view
there
is
a
sufficient
risk
of
injury
on
arrest.
if
that's
going
to
be
the
case,
if
you're
going
to
be
able
to
show
conduct
is
violent
and
aggressive
simply
because
there
is
a
sufficient
risk
of
injury
associated
with
it,
the
violent
and
aggressive
conduct
standard
does
nothing.
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
no.
the
distinction
i'm
drawing
here
is
the
act
that
you
take
of
invading
somebody
else's
space
and
the
prospect
--
what
you're
doing
is
you're
consciously
taking
an
act
fully
aware
that
violence
might
ensue,
which
suggests
that
you
are
the
sort
of
person
who
is
comfortable
in
a
violent
situation
or
at
least
dangerously
comfortable
in
such
a
violent
situation,
regardless
of
how
frequently
that
--
that
circumstance
actually
is
realized.
you're
the
sort
of
person
who
has
taken
an
action
that
expresses
comfort
with
that
sort
of
situation.
failing
to
report--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--if
it's
--
if
it's
felonious,
trespass
might
be.
you're
invading
someone's
space
in
the
circumstance
where
the
response
is
--
i
think
there
is
a
decent
argument
for
trespass
if
for
no
other
reason
than
the
act
itself,
on
the
violence
and
aggressive
standard
side,
the
act
itself
is
more
or
less
the
same
as
burglary.
it's
not
as
if
you
can
immediately
tell
from
observing
the
burglar
enter
the
structure
that
he
has
the
intent,
the
requisite
intent
to
commit
another
crime.
but
the
other
reason
why
i
doubt
that
trespass
might
be
--
might
satisfy
the
standard
is
because
there
may
not
--
there
doesn't
appear
to
be
a
serious
potential
risk
of
injury.
the
second
--
the
other
requirement
may
not
be
satisfied.
i
just
don't
have
any
information
about
that.
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
i'm
making
both
arguments,
your
honor.
but
yes,
that
is
one,
that
is
one
of
them.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
to
begin
with
where
mr.
roberts
left
off,
most
states
in
fact
do
distinguish
in
their
statutes
between
failure
to
report
and
prison
break
escapes.
these
are
cited
by
both
parties
in
the
briefs
and
you
can
review
them,
but
there
are
clear
distinctions
in
the
law.
so
the
risk
that
prison
break
escape
is
somehow
going
to
escape
--
escape,
if
you
will,
from
the
scope
of
the
statute
as
a
result
of
a
reversal
is
--
is
unfounded.
just
to
make
a
couple
of
things
clear.
first
of
all
with
respect
to
the
sentence,
justice
ginsburg,
the
--
he
was
sentenced
to
six
additional
months
but
it
was
stayed
as
--
as
was
mentioned;
and
so
when
i
was
answering
that
question
he
did
not
serve
additional
time
as
a
result
of
that,
and
that's
what
i
was
referring
to.
if
you
look
at
the
sentencing
transcript,
that's
where
the
indication
is
that
he
did
in
fact
serve
out
four
additional
weekends.
it's
not
noted
in
the
--
it's
not
noted
as
an
additional
sentence,
punishment
for
it.
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
that
was
the
armed
robbery
--
the
robbery
crime,
not
armed
robbery,
the
robbery
crime.
that's
the
first
predicate
offense
here.

second,
with
respect
to
the
anecdotal
cases,
you
know,
we
looked
at
them;
you
could
look
at
them.
if
there
are
two
instances
where
there
are
injury
--
there
are
two
instances
where
there
are
injury,
i
didn't
catch
that,
and
i
apologize
if
i
misspoke.
but
it
doesn't
change
the
core
of
the
problem,
which
is
that
the
anecdotal
evidence
produced
--
and
that
dates
back
all
the
way
to
1977,
they
looked
back
at
cases
--
they
are
covering
on
extraordinary
broad
period
of
time
in
looking
for
this
stuff,
and
there
is
just
not
--
there
is
not
a
lot
there,
if
there
is
anything
there
at
all,
with
respect
to
injury
associated
with
failure
to
report.
on
the
core
substance
of
their
argument,
mr.
roberts
emphasized
that
failing
to
report
has
as
an
element
avoiding
arrest,
avoiding
confinement.
i
don't
actually
think
that's
right.
there
is
nothing
about
concealment.
there
is
nothing
about
hiding.
there
is
nothing
about
seeking
to
escape
from
a
police
officer
who
comes
to
bring
you
back.
he
just
didn't
go;
and
in
fact
we
don't
--
the
record
doesn't
explain
why;
but
you
know,
it
was
the
november
to
december
period.
it's
the
holiday
period
of
time
for
people
when
they,
obviously,
for
a
variety
of
reasons
might
prefer
to
spend
time
with
their
families.
whatever
the
reason
was--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--there
were
four
periods
from
the
end
of
november,
four
consecutive
weekends
from
the
end
of
november
into
december.
there
is
no
indication,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
any
further
robberies
were
committed
during
that
period.
but
the
point
is--
mr.
robert
n.
hochman
--not
in
the
record.
it's
absolutely
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
no
doubt.
but
the
point
is
that
while
mr.
roberts
stood
up
and
said
it's
about
avoiding
arrest;
it's
about
concealing
yourself;
it's
the
sort
of
person
that's
prone
to
react
violently;
the
fact
is,
that's
speculation;
and
everything
we
know
from
the
sentencing
commission
and
from
their
own
efforts
suggests
the
contrary.
and
indeed
even
the
dangerous
weapon
findings
of
the
sentencing
commission,
i
think,
should
be
excluded,
because
under
the
guidelines,
the
mere
possession
of
a
weapon
is
not
a
violent
felony.
a
felon
in
possession
is
not
--
cannot
be
a
predicate
offense
under
the
guidelines.
and
so
the
mere
possession
of
a
weapon,
which
is
all
you
have
on
those
five
instances
--
by
the
way,
the
fact
that
they
did
not
double-count
them
as
also
including
four
suggests
they
weren't
used
in
any
way,
they
weren't
brandished
in
any
way.
it's
just
not
there.
there
is
really
nothing
there
to
support
the
government's
speculation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
your
honors.
