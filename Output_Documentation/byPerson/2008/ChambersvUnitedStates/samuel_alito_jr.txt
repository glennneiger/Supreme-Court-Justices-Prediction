well--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
you
look
at
the
cases
that
we've
had
to
decide
under
this
statute
in
the
last
couple
of
years,
do
you
think
they
illustrate
that
the
categorical
approach
just
doesn't
work
in
this
situation?
because
it
puts
us
in
a
position
for
every
single
crime
that
comes
up
here
of
making
--
of
trying
to
ascertain
what
is
the
serious
risk
when
we
don't
have
any
empirical
--
we
don't
have
a
number
quantifying
what
a
serious
risk
is,
nor
can
we
generally
find
what
the
risk
is
that's
associated
with
a
particular
class
of
cases.
maybe
when
congress
enacted
this
they
never
anticipated
that
it
would
be
done
on
a
categorical
basis.
why
not
just
have
a
determination
as
to
whether
there
was
a
serious
potential
risk
in
this
particular
case?
so,
if
you
have
a
--
a
nonviolent
person
who
walks
away,
that's
one
thing.
if
you
have
somebody
who
has
a
long
list
of
convictions
for
violent
--
violent
crimes
and
escapes,
that's
another
situation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
a
separate
question?
if
it
had
--
if
it
has
to
be
found
by
a
jury,
it
can
be
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
it
could,
and
if
it
had
read
these
cases
and
it
was
paying
attention
to
this
problem,
you
would
think
it
would
go
through
a
list
of
crimes
and
say,
these
fall
within
it
and
these
don't
fall
within
it.
but
obviously
it
hasn't
done
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
argument
is
that
the
failing
to
report
is
not
violent
and
aggressive
and
therefore,
no
matter
what
degree
of
risk
the
statistics
might
show,
it
would
not
qualify?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
happen
to
know
how
many
additional
crimes
are
likely
to
raise
issues
like
this
under
the
residual
clause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well
after
we
decide
this
case,
how
many
more
cases
like
this
do
you
anticipate
that
we're
--
we
may
get
under
acca?
