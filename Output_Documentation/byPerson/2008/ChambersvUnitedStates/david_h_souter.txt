when
you
say
burglary,
if
you're
at
home,
if
you're
at
home
it's
going
to
get
violent
and
aggressive.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
that
got
to
do
with
increasing
the
risk
of
violence?
i
mean,
i
see
--
i
see
your
kind
of
elements
argument,
but
it
seems
to
be
beside
the
point
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
the
crime
is
still
--
the
crime
that
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
still
essentially
a
passive
crime.
he
just
doesn't
show
up.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
given,
you
know,
the
close
logical
connections,
i
don't
see
that
the
close
logical
connections
convert
the
passive
crime
into
a
higher
degree
of
resisting
arrest
from
any
other.
in
fact,
it
suggests
just
the
opposite.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
know,
you
may
precisely
be
doing
nothing.
if
i
say,
you
know,
it's
monday
morning
at
9
o'clock,
i'm
supposed
to
--
to
report
to
prison,
and
i'm
going
to
stay
home,
my
purpose
is
to
stay
put
in
my
armchair.
that's
purposeful
conduct
and
it's
about
as
passive
as
you
can
get.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
argument
goes
simply
to
whether
there
is
potential
and
the
statute
says
"serious
potential".
which
gets
us,
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
point
that
justice
kennedy
is
making,
and
that
is,
we've
got
to
have
something
more
than
an
instinctive
belief
that
something
bad
might
happen.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
were
taking
as
examples
cases
in
which
there
was
serious
potential.
but
in
any
event,
you
can't
lose
sight
of
the
modifier.
it
has
got
to
be
more
than
a
so-called
"potential
risk".
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
--
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
just
to
get
some
sense
about
what
will
qualify?
i
mean,
i
think
we
--
we
all
agree
that
the
risk
of
violence
in
arrest
is
probably
going
to
vary
depending
on
--
categorically
depending
on
the
crimes.
i
think
i
would
probably
agree
that
white-collar
crimes
are
not
likely
to
--
to
carry
a
very
high
risk
of
violence
on
arrest.
so
i
--
there's
one
category.
can
you
think
of
others,
other
categories
outside
of
white-collar
crime,
that
are
going
to
have
a
lower
risk
of
arrest
than,
say,
the
failure-to-report
category?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
are
going
to
be
in
category
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
