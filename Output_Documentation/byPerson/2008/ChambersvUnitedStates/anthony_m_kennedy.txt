but
suppose
it
were
shown
--
this
is
hypothetical.
suppose
it
were
shown
that
90
percent
of
all
escapes
under
the
escape
statute
were
breakouts
involving
weapons;
10
percent
were
failure
to
report.
would
that
affect
how
we
decide
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
look
to
the
crime
to
see
generally
whether
or
not
it
involves
violence
and
serious
risk
of
harm?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that,
in
my
hypothetical,
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
case
than
the
case
we
have
here
or
would
it
be
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
my
hypothetical
is,
under
the
statute,
if
you
look
at
the
whole
universe
of
prosecutions
under
the
escape
statute,
90
percent
of
them
are
for
breakouts
involving
weapons.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
what
we
looked
to
in
begay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
might
not,
if
it
just
said
"escape",
and
then
you'd
have
this
same
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
failure
to
respond
to
a
traffic
ticket.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
--
can
you
tell
me:
the
u.s.
attorney
has
this
case.
the
man
failed
to
report
for
custody
some
--
a
few
years
earlier,
and
you
have
this
offense.
does
the
district
attorney
or
--
pardon
me
--
the
united
states
attorney
have
some
discretion
here
that
he
may
not
prosecute
at
all?
what
--
what
goes
into
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
goes
through
the
mind
of
--
of
a
prosecutor?
he
says,
because
this
fellow
failed
to
report
earlier
for
this
offense,
i'm
going
to
give
him
15
extra
years
in
jail.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
does
a
--
are
there
many
instances
where
you
think
in
a
case
like
this
a
u.s.
attorney
would
just
elect
not
to
file
that
charge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
do
you
think
they
automatically
file
it
every
time;
and
if
not,
how
do
they
define
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
they
ever
look
at
the
--
do
they
ever
look
at
the
attorney?
this
attorney
has
been
giving
us
a
hard
time,
and
we
ought
to
show
him
that
we
really
mean
business?
do
they
look
at
the
nature
of
the
--
the
identity
of
the
counsel
of
the
defendant?
do
they
ever
look
at
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
potential
risk
is
based
on
an
empirical
assessment.
what's
--
how
can
we
make
an
empirical
assessment
without
statistics?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
that's
based
on
our
experience
because
we
have
these
cases;
we've
been
lawyers;
we
know
what
they
usually
involve.
we
have
some
sort
of
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--an
instinct
or
a
basis
for
making
a
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
statistics
can
inform
that,
why
ignore
the
statistics?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
that's
the
point.
begay
talked
about
purposeful
violent
conduct,
not
just
purposeful
conduct.
