what
was
the
sentence
for
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
didn't
get
any
extra
jail
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
wouldn't
that
be
so
of
any
crime?
this
is
failure
to
report.
any
crime,
any
--
an
arrest
for
any
crime
has
a
certain
risk
that
the
arrestee
is
going
to
resist.
is
there
anything
different,
is
anything
greater,
about
this
arrest
for
this
kind
of
crime?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
mr.
hochman
told
us--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--when
i
asked
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
would
the
statute
apply
if
--
say
he
is
supposed
to
go
in
on
the
weekends.
instead,
he
goes
out
on
a
binge,
and
then
he
voluntarily
comes
in
on
a
monday
morning
saying,
yes,
i
failed
to
report,
and
so
here
i
am.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
distinction
between
this
crime
and
crimes
in
general
is
that
this
person
has
shown
that
he
or
she
doesn't
want
to
go
back
into
custody,
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
is
--
there
was,
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
seventh
circuit,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
since
this
case
was
decided,
the
seventh
circuit
has
changed
its
position
and
has
gone
the
other
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
first
time
around,
didn't
one
of
the
judges
suggest
that
there
ought
to
be
a
study
comparing
the
frequency
of
violence
in
escapes
from
custody
to
the
frequency
of
violence
in
failure
to
report,
and
isn't
that
what
we
now
have
from
the
sentencing
commission?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
he
did
this
four
times.
i
thought
there
were
four.
