justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
really
a
problem
about
--
about
what
you
suggest.
it
may
destroy
the
whole
benefit
of
the
categorical
approach.
i
mean,
you
can
always
shave
something
down
to
become
a
narrower
crime.
an
escape
statute,
for
example,
i
suppose
you
could
look
to
see
whether
the
particular
escape
in
question
from
the
charging
document
was
an
escape
that
used
firearms
or
was
an
escape
that,
you
know,
that
injured
or
killed
guards.
and,
you
know,
that
gets
us
into
the
case-by-case
examination
that
it
is
the
whole
purpose
of
the
categorical
approach
to
avoid.
now,
how
do
we
--
how
do
we
avoid
getting
to
the
bottom
of
that
slippery
slope?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i
mean,
the
charge
mentions
--
mentions
a
firearm.
anything
that's
in
the
charge
can
be
used
to
narrow
the
crime
that
we
are
looking
at.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
an
element
of
the
crime.
if
using
a
firearm
is
not
an
element
of
escape,
then
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
an
element.
so,
if
all
the
evidence
in
the
case
was
that,
you
know,
he
wrestled
a
gun
from
the
guard
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
prison
that
way,
if
the
jury
found
him
guilty,
that
was
the
only
basis
on
which
it
could
have
found
him
guilty,
that
would
be
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
sounds
like
an
element.
that
sounds
like
an
element.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
it
depends
upon
how,
how,
what
should
i
say,
how
often
that
prospect
is
realized.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
statute
itself
lists
robbery
and
robbery
very
often
doesn't
involve
any
threat
of
injury,
but
all
and
all
we
think
it
does.
obviously,
congress
thought
it
did,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
mean
to
say
robbery.
i
meant
to
say
burglary.
why
is
burglary
violent
or
aggressive?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
burglary
by
its
nature
is
--
you
do
it
at
night.
you
don't
want
to
be
detected.
it's
not
violent
or
aggressive
at
all.
it's
sneaky,
is
what
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
robbery
is
violent
or
aggressive.
you're
quite
right
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
--
that
may
be,
but
it
does
not
in
its
nature
indicate
violence
or
aggressiveness.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
gets
you
right
back
into
the
soup.
what
you're
saying
is
all
it
requires
is
that
there
be
a
potential
for
violence,
for
aggressiveness,
right?
and
that's
what
the
government
says
here:
there
is
a
potential
for
violence
and
aggressiveness.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
square
with
the
answer
you
gave
me
with
regard
to
burglary.
if
what
you
just
said
is
true,
burglary
wouldn't
be
among
the
listed
crimes.
justice
antonin
scalia
say
that
again.
i
didn't
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
not
common
sense
that
the
person
who
has
been
guilty
of
a
crime
so
gentlemanly
that
they
only
made
him
report
to
prison
on
the
weekends
would
confront
the
policeman
with
violence
when
he
comes.
this
is
not
normally
what
you
think
of
as
a
violent
type
who
has
--
who
has
been
told
to
report
weekends
to
the
prison.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
did
he
get
additional
time,
by
the
way,
when
--
when
they
finally
brought
him
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
just
--
he
just
had
to
make
up
the
weekends
that
he
had
lost?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
guy
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
jack
the
ripper.
he
really
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
didn't
use
a
gun.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
is
you
say
if
he
had
used
a
gun.
and
he
didn't
use
a
gun.
i
mean,
to
come
up
with
your
statistics
on
the
basis
of
something
that
didn't
happen
is
not
using
statistics;
it's
using
imagination.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
he
serving
those
weekends
for?
what
was
the
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
just
gets
weekends
for
that?
how
many
weekends?
justice
antonin
scalia
pretty
good
deal.
[laughter]
