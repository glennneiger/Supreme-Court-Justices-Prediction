chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
08-441,
gross
v.
fbl
financial
services.
mr.
schnapper.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
some
disagreement
among
the
parties,
of
course,
what
"direct
evidence"
means,
whether
it
means
direct
as
opposed
to
circumstantial,
or
direct
in
--
in
the
terms
that
for
example
judge
colloton
put
it
in
the
decision
below.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
telling
us
that
we've
never
required
direct
evidence,
when
you're
not
taking
a
position
on
what
direct
evidence
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
you
may
be
right
or
you
may
be
wrong.
but
we
kind
of
have
to
know
what
we're
dealing
with.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
your
petition,
you
asked
--
you
used
the
phrase
"direct
evidence".
and
i
just
want
to
know
in
what
sense
you
mean
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
your
response
to
justice
souter's
question,
you
said
you're
only
focusing
on
the
direct
evidence
threshold.
but
if
direct
evidence
is
the
threshold
to
give
you
the
benefit
of
shifting
the
burden
of
persuasion
of
the
employer,
is
it
really
fair
for
you
to
be
able
to
say,
we
are
only
going
to
take
out
one
side
of
the
balance;
we're
going
to
leave
the
other
side
of
the
balance
there?
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
artificial
to
separate
the
two
requirements,
the
two
aspects
of
the
price
waterhouse
inquiry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
the
difficulty
of
figuring
out
who
is
controlling
in
--
in
price
waterhouse.
but
at
least
as
it
has
been
applied,
my
understanding
--
i
understand
it
has
been
applied
in
different
ways.
my
understanding
of
what
people
mean
when
they
say
"the
price
waterhouse
approach",
which
is
that
there
is
a
higher
showing
of
evidence,
direct
evidence,
whatever
--
people
don't
agree
on
what
that
means.
but
if
you
meet
that
showing,
then
the
burden
of
persuasion
shifts
to
the
employer
on
the
issue
of
causation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
blatt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
will
let
you
get
your
third
reason
in,
in
a
minute,
but
why
--
do
you
really
think
it's
fair
to
pick
one
part
of
a
complicated
test
that
the
court
has
constructed
and
say,
well,
this
one
doesn't
make
any
sense,
and
pull
it
out?
i
mean,
maybe
it
only
makes
sense
in
the
context
of
the
whole
construct,
or
maybe
none
of
the
elements
actually
make
sense.
but
it
seems
to
me
very
artificial
to
focus
on
one
aspect
and
say,
let's
fix
this,
without
assessing
what
its
impact
is
on
the
rest
of
the
test.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
was
because
--
that
was
because
of
the
1991
act,
which
addressed
title
vii
and
quite
deliberately
left
adea
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
asking
us
to
overrule
the
aspect
of
price
waterhouse
involving
direct
evidence,
at
least
if
you
look
at
justice
o'connor's
opinion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
would
be
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
on
just
saying
let's
get
rid
of
all
these
artificial
court
constructions
and
say
this
is
like
any
other
case,
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
persuasion,
and
the
defendant
can
come
up
with
what
defenses
he
has,
including
that
i
did
this
for
some
other
reason
--
it
wasn't
because
of
age
--
and
the
jury
looks
at
it
and
decides
whom
they
believe?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
statute
--
the
statute
has
language.
it
says
"because
of".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
tell
the
jury
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
go
ahead
and
make
your
third
point
briefly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
get
back
to
justice
stevens's
hypothetical?
you
have
two
people
making
a
decision;
one
says
it's
because
of
age,
the
one
because
of
something,
and
--
a
legitimate
factor
--
and
you
acknowledge
that
that
could
get
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
is
it
under
an
instruction
that
simply
says
"because
of"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
mean
--
you
say--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
say
"but
for"
causation,
but
my
understanding
of
justice
stevens's
hypothetical
is
that
it's
going
to
be
very
hard
to
say
that
one
would
not
have
had
--
the
discrimination,
the
alleged
action,
would
not
have
happened
but
for
one
factor
or
the
other
if
they
are
just
two
different
factors.
you
would
just
leave
that
up
to
the
jury
to
say
"because
of"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
now,
mr.
schnapper,
2
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-441,
gross
versus
fbl
financial
services
which
he
has
asked
me
to
announce.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
petitioner
filed
suit
alleging
that
respondent
demoted
him
in
violation
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
of
1976
which
we
will
call
adea.
that
act
makes
it
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
take
an
adverse
action
against
an
employee
“because
of
such
individuals
age.”
at
the
close
of
trial,
the
district
court
instructed
the
jury
to
enter
a
verdict
for
petitioner
if
he
proved
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
was
demoted
and
that
his
age
was
a
“motivating
factor”
in
the
decision
to
demote
him.
the
district
court
also
instructed
the
jury
to
return
the
verdict
for
respondent
if
respondent
proved
that
it
would
have
demoted
petitioner
regardless
of
his
age.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
for
petitioner.
the
eighth
circuit
reversed
and
remanded
for
a
new
trial.
it
held
that
the
jury
instructions
were
incorrect
under
the
standard
established
by
this
court
in
a
case
called
price
waterhouse
versus
hopkins.
price
waterhouse
involved
the
claim
brought
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
alleging
that
an
adverse
employment
action
was
the
result
of
both
permissible
and
impermissible
considerations,
that's
the
claim
price
waterhouse
involved
is
so
called
“mixed-motives”
case.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
to
day,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
because
title
vii
is
materially
different
from
the
adea
with
respect
to
the
relevant
burden
of
persuasion,
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
adea
is
not
governed
by
title
vii
decisions
such
as
price
waterhouse.
this
court
has
never
applied
title
vii's
burden-shifting
framework
for
alleged
mixed-motives
claims
to
the
adea
and
we
decline
to
do
so
now.
title
vii
has
been
amended
to
explicitly
authorize
discrimination
claims
where
an
improper
consideration
was
a
“motivating
factor”
for
the
adverse
action.
in
contrast,
the
adea
does
not
similarly
provide
that
a
plaintiff
may
establish
discrimination
by
showing
that
age
was
simply
a
motivating
factor.
as
a
result,
the
court's
interpretation
of
the
adea
is
not
governed
by
interpretation
of
title
vii
in
price
waterhouse.
our
inquiry
instead
must
focus
on
the
text
of
the
adea
to
decide
whether
it
authorizes
an
alleged
mixed-motives
age
discrimination
claim.
it
does
not.
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
adea's
requirement
that
an
employer
took
adverse
action
“because
of”
age
is
that
age
was
the
reason
that
the
employer
acted.
to
establish
a
disparate-treatment
claim
then,
a
plaintiff
retains
the
burden
of
persuasion
to
establish
that
age
was
the
“but-for”
cause
of
the
employer's
adverse
decision.
this
court
has
previously
held
this
to
be
the
proper
allocation
of
the
burden
of
persuasion
in
adea
cases
and
nothing
in
the
statute's
text
indicates
that
congress
has
carved
out
an
exception
for
a
particular
subset
of
adea
claims.
hence,
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
the
same
in
an
alleged
mixed-motives
age
discrimination
case
as
in
any
other
adea
disparate-treatment
action.
a
plaintiff
must
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
which
maybe
direct
or
circumstantial
that
age
was
the
“but-for”
cause
of
the
challenged
employer
decision.
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
souter,
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined.
justice
breyer
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
souter
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
