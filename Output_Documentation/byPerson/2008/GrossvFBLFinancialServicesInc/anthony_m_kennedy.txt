justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
--
i
just
want
--
you
said
that
the
court
has
never
imposed
a
burden-of-proof-shifting
requirement
absent
a
directive
from
congress?
are
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
maybe
--
maybe
i
misheard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
--
your
position,
and
you
rest
heavily
on
the
argument,
i
think,
that
there's
no
textural
support
in
the
adea
for
a
heightened
evidence
requirement
in
order
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof.
but
isn't
it
true
there's
no
textural
support
for
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
at
all?
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
--
can
convince
us
of
the
first
proposition
without
confronting
the
second.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
affirmative
defenses
are
usually
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
on
the
party
asserting
the
affirmative
defense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
--
in
response
further
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
and
i
think
justice
souter's,
too,
is
there
--
are
there
any
tactical
difficulties
or
strategic
difficulties
that
counsel
face
if
they
don't
quite
know
which
way
the
burden
is
going
to
shift
before
trial?
the
--
the
number
of
witnesses
you
have
waiting
in
the
hallway
or
--
this
--
this
would
be
after
summary
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
solicitor
general
says,
well,
this
is
going
to
affect
title
vii.
it's
going
to
affect
all
kinds
of
other
acts.
this
is
watershed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
--
pardon
me?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it's
statutory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
--
let's
assume
that
we
have
authority
to
incorporate
the
title
vii
jurisprudence
into
the
adea
area
as
a
matter
of
choice.
are
there
reasons
why
there
should
be
distinctions
between
the
two
regimes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
reasons
of
administration
or
fairness
other
than
--
i
recognize
that
one
is
statutory
and
the
others
would
--
would
be
our
case
law.
