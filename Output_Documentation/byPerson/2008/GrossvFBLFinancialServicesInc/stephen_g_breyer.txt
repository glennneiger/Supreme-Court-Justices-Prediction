stephen
g.
breyer
would
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--would
you
think
you
should
have
the
burden
in
the
following
situation?
at
10:00
o'clock
on
march
21st
the
employer
says:
i'm
going
to
get
rid
of
smith
because
he's
too
old.
all
right?
that's
it.
writes
out
the
letter,
"good-bye,
smith".
an
hour
later
someone
walks
into
the
employer's
office
and
says:
i've
discovered
that
smith
was
just
convicted
of
larceny.
now,
he
already
fired
smith
because
he
was
too
old.
but
i
take
it
he
can
make
the
defense:
well,
smith
would
have
been
fired
anyway;
that
isn't
the
reason
i
fired
him,
but
he
would
have
been
fired
anyway.
and
he
can
get
off,
but
he
should
make
that
defense,
shouldn't
he?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
so
the
answer
is
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
now
we
have
the
same
situation,
but
the
jury
has
said
this
bad
reason,
his
age,
was
a
motivating
factor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
me
--
no,
didn't
say
played
a
role.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
it
says
in
this
instruction
that
i
have
--
i
don't
see
the
other
one--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
i
have
on
page
7
of
--
of
the
appellant's
brief
that
the
instruction
was
"the
plaintiff's
age
was
a
motivating
factor--
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--"in
defendant's
decision".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
when
i
read
that,
i
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
okay.
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
perfect,
perfect.
i
didn't
want
to
complicate
it,
but
that
may
work
in
your
favor
to
complicate
it,
and
i
want
to
be
fair.
[laughter]
fine.
it
played
a
part.
it
did
have
a
role:
age
motivated
in
part.
now,
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
matter?
because
we
have
a
statute
that
says
age
shouldn't
play
a
role
in.
"play
a
role"
means
it
made
a
difference.
i
mean,
to
me.
otherwise
it
played
no
role.
it
was
an
understudy,
a
ghost.
it
"played
a
role"
if
it
would
have
made
a
difference.
"played
a
part",
it
would
have
made
a
difference,
just
like
my
first
case.
so
we
have
an
action,
other
things
being
equal,
that
should
be
illegal
under
this
statute.
but
then,
just
as
in
the
first
case,
we
give
the
employer
a
defense:
if
you
can
show
that
in
the
absence
of
that
age
there
in
your
mind,
you
would
have
done
it
anyway,
which
means
the
mix
of
motives
would
have
been
different,
then
you
get
off.
so,
if
in
the
first
case
we
in
fact
say
it
should
be
on
the
--
burden
should
be
on
the
employer,
why
shouldn't
it
be
in
the
second
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
will
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--will
you
go
back?
i'm
sorry
to
be
hung
up
on
this
point.
maybe
there
are
15
cases
that
just
prove
i
am
wrong.
but
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
--
let's
try
other
areas
of
the
law.
the
dam
is
a
nuisance.
we
now
show,
to
prove
that
it's
a
nuisance,
that
it
played
a
role
in
the
death
of
my
fish.
i
mean,
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case?
damages
might
be
at
issue
--
how
much
of
a
role
--
but
as
far
as
liability
is
concerned
the
gears
were
rusty.
the
rusty
gears
played
a
role
in
the
derailing
of
the
train.
again,
it
might
be
a
question
of
who
is
responsible
for
what,
but
that
there
is
liability
i
think
in
most
areas
of
tort
law
would
be
over
once
you
prove
that
the
defendant's
factor
played
a
role.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
the
law
here
--
am
i
wrong
about
ordinary
tort
law?
possibly.
i
don't
know
it
that
well.
is
it
that
i
--
is
it
that
this
area
is
special?
is
it
that
there
are
cases
so
you
can
say
any
of
those
three?
i
am
prepared
to
be
totally
wrong.
i
hope
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
say
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
think
"played
a
role"
combines
at
least
the
necessary
condition,
but
i
don't
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
you
have
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--"played
a
role"
--
how
did
it
play
a
role
if
it
was
not
a
necessary
condition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
are
trying
to
say,
which
is
--
which
is
making
me
think
is
a
lot
about
--
we
have
a
human
being
who
did
certain
acts.
and
we
know
this.
we
know
that
human
being
had
a
mix
of
motives
and
that
the
bad
motive
played
a
role.
it
was
a
motivating
force.
and
that
might
be
sufficient.
it
is
under
title
vii.
and
if
you
want
to
interpret
this
like
title
vii,
that's
fine.
that's
the
end
of
it.
but
then
we
are
going
to
let
someone
off
if
we
imagine
a
different,
but
hypothetical,
situation.
the
hypothetical
is
where
the
bad
motive
isn't
there.
well,
it's
hard
to
prove
what
human
beings
would
do
in
a
hypothetical
situation
that
isn't
the
real
situation.
and
i
take
it
that's
the
reason
we
have
imposed
this
burden
upon
the
employer.
is
there
an
analogy
to
that
in
tort
law?
