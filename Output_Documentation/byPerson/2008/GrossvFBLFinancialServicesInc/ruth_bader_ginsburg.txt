justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
variety
of
views
among
the
circuits
on
what
justice
o'connor
meant
by
the
term
"direct
evidence"?
it
wasn't
defined
in
price
waterhouse
either.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
is
a
range
of
views
on
what
it
means,
starting
from
direct
versus
circumstantial,
to
something
like
strong
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
event,
it
was
the
view
of
only
one
justice,
justice
o'connor
alone.
she
did
make
the
fifth
vote,
but
no
one
else
accepted
a
direct
evidence
test.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
would
you
--
would
you
urge
that
we
should
count
justice
white's
decision
as
the
controlling
decision
rather
than
justice
o'connor's?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
schnapper,
there
is
a
difference
--
and
i
think
it's
critical
to
your
case
--
between
what's
called
the
prima
facie
case
that
a
plaintiff
would
make
under
the
mcdonnell
douglas
test
and
proving
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
in
this
case
age
discrimination
was
a
motivating
factor.
i
think
you
must
concede
that,
in
order
to
fit
within
this
double
motive
frame,
you
must
show
not
simply
a
prima
facie
case,
but
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
discriminatory
factor
was
a
motivating
factor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
--
can
one
know
if
you've
met
that
burden
before
the
case
goes
to
the
jury?
that
is,
when
--
when
the
case
starts
out,
it's
unknown
whether
you
have
established
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
age
discrimination
was
a
motivating
factor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
couldn't
--
couldn't
any
title
vii
case
be
presented
in
either
framework?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals,
it
said
that
justice
o'connor's
opinion
was
the
controlling
opinion,
it
was
the
decision
on
the
narrowest
ground;
therefore,
the
lower
courts
ought
to
take
that
decision
as
the
law
made
by
price
waterhouse.
then
there's
a
question
of
what
did
she
mean
by
"direct
evidence"?
but
i
think
the
eighth
circuit
certainly
did
say
justice
o'connor's
opinion
states
the
law
of
price
waterhouse,
and
that
was
the
basis
on
which
their
decision
turned.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
o'connor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
price
waterhouse
deviated
--
that
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
have
these
two
regimes
out
there.
you
are
reciting
mcdonnell
douglas
and
say
everything
should
follow
that
pattern,
but
to
do
that
you
have
to
overrule
price
waterhouse,
which
gave
recognition
to
the
mixed
motive
framework
that
comes
out
of
mount
healthy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
schnapper
recognized
when
i
asked
this
question,
how
does
this
differ
from
the
prima
facie
case
that
you
make
under
mcdonnell
douglas
and
burdine?
he
said:
we
don't
have
to
just
make
a
preliminary
showing;
we
have
to
establish
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
prohibited
discrimination
was
a
motivating
factor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
--
that
question
--
i
think
it
can't
be
before
us.
we
would
certainly
want
to
know
what
the
government's
position
is
on
it.
and
ms.
blatt
was
very
clear
that
the
government
is
not
taking
a
position
on
that
issue
today.
your
brief
in
opposition
did
not
so
much
as
mention
mcdonnell
douglas.
so
how
is
anybody
to
think
that
was
at
stake,
that
that
regime,
which
you
later
clarify
in
your
respondent's
brief,
you
think
should
be
the
sole
test?
how
could
that
come
into
this
case
when
it's
not
in
the
brief
in
opposition
and,
therefore,
it's
not
in
the
petitioner's
brief
and
it's
not
in
the
government's
brief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
line
is
following
that
same
formula.
all
those
cases
are
following
that
litany:
prima
facie
case,
non-discriminatory
reason--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
those
weren't
--
those
weren't
thought
of
in
the
mixed
motive
framework.
and
what
you
want
to
do
is
get
rid
of
the
mixed
motive
and
say,
in
a
discrimination
case,
there
should
be
only
one
regime,
and
the
plaintiff
should
have
the
burden
of
persuasion
from
start
to
finish.
but
that's
not
what
mcdonnell
douglas
did.
it's
not
what
the
eighth
circuit
did,
which
you
acknowledge
by
not
even
bringing
this
up
until
your
brief
on
the
merits.
so
--
and
you
also
said
that
title
vii
is
out
of
it.
the
statute
has
taken
care
of
it
in
1991.
ms.
blatt,
i
heard
her
say
distinctly
that
--
that
title
vii
would
be
affected.
she
urges
not
to
touch
this
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
assume
--
and
i
assume
the
government,
because
it
would
certainly
be
informative
to
know
what
the
agency
responsible
for
the
administration
of
title
vii
thinks
of
this
question.
