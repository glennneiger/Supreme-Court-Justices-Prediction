justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
the
only
issue
that
you
have
raised
before
us
is
whether
the
evidence
that
does
raise
a
burden
on
the
defendant's
part
has
got
to
be,
whatever
this
means,
direct
or
not?
that's
the
only
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
am
i
right
that
the
only
source
of
argument
for
the
proposition
that
it
does
have
to
be
direct
evidence
is
justice
o'connor's
opinion,
separate
opinion?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
are
--
there
are
arguments
about
the
need
for
substantial
evidence.
but
the
argument
for
direct
evidence
goes
back
to
the
separate
o'connor
opinion.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
are
you
--
i
mean,
we're
going
to
hear
about
this.
are
you
going
to
make
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
that
should
not
be
regarded
as
the
controlling
opinion,
and
if
that
is
the
source
of
it,
that
is
the
end
of
the
issue?
are
you
--
are
you
going
to
get
into
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
i
think
you
should.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
understand
the
white
opinion,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
character
of
the
evidence.
it
had
to
do
with
the
degree
of
persuasiveness
of
the
evidence.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
don't
understand
what
"substantial"
means.
what
do
you
think
he
meant
by
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong.
i
assume
that
in
a
jury
case
that
simply
was
left
to
the
jury,
and
the
instruction
would
be
something
like
this:
if
you
find
that
the
plaintiff
has
shown
that
age
was
a
motivating
factor,
then
you
look
to
the
next
question.
and
that
is:
has
the
defendant
shown
that
he
would
have
fired
the
plaintiff
anyway?
isn't
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
david
h.
souter
regardless
of
what
the
parties
may
prefer,
isn't
it
likely
that
the
jury,
regardless
of
instruction,
is
going
to
say
something
like
this:
if
we
find
that
--
that
age
really
was
in
the
boss's
mind
when
he
fired
the
person,
and
the
boss
comes
in,
regardless
of
the
instructions,
and
says
the
guy's
work
was
no
good,
he
got
late
--
he
arrived
late
every
day
and
so
on,
the
jury
is
going
to
say:
did
they
really
fire
him
because
he
was
old
or
because
he
didn't
come
to
work
on
time?
they
are
going
to
do
the
same
thing
that
they
are
going
to
do
on
the
burden-shifting
instruction,
probably,
aren't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can't
know
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
if
you
said
to
the
jury,
do
the
right
thing,
they'd
probably
come
out
about
the
same
way
that
they
would
come
out
if
you
gave
the
burden-shifting
instruction,
i
think.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
reason
i
raise
the
issue
is,
if
--
if
we
are
saying
do
we
--
do
we
ditch
price
waterhouse,
my
questions
i
guess
are
suggesting
something
to
the
effect,
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
david
h.
souter
juries
--
juries
are
smarter
than
judges.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
will
get
to
the
jury,
and
if
the
jury
accepts
all
your
evidence,
the
jury
can
find
in
your
favor.
but
the
difference
between
a
prima
facie
showing
and
what
has
to
be
shown
here
is,
the
jury
must
actually
find,
based
on
your
at
least
prima
facie
evidence,
that
age
was
a
motivating
factor.
and
until
the
jury
makes
that
finding,
if
it
is
properly
instructed,
it
doesn't
get
to
the
question
of
whether
the
defendant
has
any
burden
to
show
something
in
response.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
can't
get
into
that,
can
we?
i
mean,
there's
no
question
about
quantity
of
evidence
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
adequacy
of
the
jury
instruction,
but
there
isn't
a
question
as
to
whether
the
issue
should
have
gone
to
the
jury
in
the
first
place.
and
i
--
i
think
that--
