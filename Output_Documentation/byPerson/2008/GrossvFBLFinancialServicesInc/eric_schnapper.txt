mr.
eric
schnapper
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
the
plaintiff
had
to
have
direct
evidence
in
order
to
obtain
the
specific
instruction
at
issue
in
this
case.
this
court's
decision
in
desert
palace
makes
two
important
points
that
are
relevant
today.
first,
the
court
noted
that
this
court
had
at
no
time
imposed
a
direct
evidence
requirement
without
an
affirmative
directive
from
congress
to
do
so.
secondly,
the
court
noted
that
congress,
when
it
wished
to
impose
heightened
standards,
had
done--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--that
--
that's
true,
your
honor.
that
was
not
the
view
of
the
court
in
desert
palace.
desert
palace
may
have
misspoken
in
that
regard.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
we
--
we'd
like
to
think
they
are
right.
i
mean,
we
think
they
are
right.
but
of
course,
as
you
say,
that
is,
in
a
sense,
one
of
the
questions
before
us.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no.
i--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
i
may
have
misspoken,
your
honor.
what
the
court
said
was
that
this
court
had
never
imposed
a
direct
evidence
requirement--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--in
the
absence
of
an
affirmative
directive
from
congress.
mr.
eric
schnapper
your
honor,
there's
not
a
difference
between
the
parties.
we
take
no
position
on
that.
there's
a
considerable
variety
of
views
about--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--the--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--yes,
but
the
court
hasn't
put
those
two
things
together
in
the
way
you
did.
i
think
that's
fair.
the
court's
statement
in
desert
palace
didn't
define
direct
evidence.
it's
not
--
it's
not
clear
in
that
--
in
that
sense
exactly
what
the
court
meant.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
it
certainly
meant
the
court
hadn't
required
direct
evidence
in
the
sense
of
--
of
non-circumstantial
evidence,
but--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--we
--
it's
our
view
that
no
particular
--
special
evidence
is
required
to
get
the
instruction
in
this
case.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
schnapper
there
is
a
range
of
views
on
that,
but
our
view
is
the
--
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff
is
to
show
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
in
this
case
age
was
a
motivating
factor,
but
it's
not
required
to
show
it
by
any
particular
kind
of
evidence
or
to
show
it
by
strong
evidence
as
opposed
to
merely
evidence
sufficient
to
establish
that
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
believe
so,
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
it
wouldn't
present
the
same
--
there
are
special
problems
applying
it
to
jury
trials.
we
think
that
the
requirement
of
direct
evidence
is
simply
wrong
for
--
for
a
number
of
reasons.
at
the
least,
the
court
would
have
to
finally
resolve
what
direct
evidence
means
in
this
particular
context.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
it's
a
particularly
serious
problem
there,
but
if
--
if
you
were
to
announce
this
as
a
rule,
you
would
--
i
think
the
time
has
come
to
explain
definitively
what
"direct
evidence"
means.
the
courts
of
appeals
are
in
wide
disagreement
about
that,
and
--
at
some--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--your
honor,
she
made
the
sixth
vote.
there
were
five
members
of
the
court
other
than
justice
o'connor
who
agreed
in
the
result
in
that
case.
the
plurality
expressly
rejected
a
direct
evidence
requirement.
justice
white--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--to
the
extent
that
you
were
disposed
to
resolve
this
case
based
on
an
interpretation
of
price
waterhouse.
but
it's
our
view
that
the
subsequent
decision,
unanimous
decision,
in
desert
palace
makes
that
unnecessary.
desert
palace
indicates
that
heightened
proof
requirements
--
those
are
the
words
of
the
opinion.
it
suggests
that
they
should
not
be
imposed
by
the
courts
absent
a
statutory
directive.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it
was.
but
that
part
of
the
reasoning
of
the
case
is
not
based
on
the
language
of
title
vii
other
than
the
absence
from
title
vii
of
that
specific
language.
the
structure
of
the
opinion
first
talks
about
the
definition
of
701(n).
that's
obviously
not
relevant
to
the
adea.
but
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
absence
in
title
vii
of
any
heightened
proof
requirement
also
weighs
heavily
against
the
court's
inferring,
and
that
part
of
the
reasoning
isn't
limited
to
title
vii.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
the
--
this
court
has
on
a
number
of
occasions
allocated
the
burden
of
proof
among
the
parties,
including
to
a
defendant,
without
a
specific
textual
basis.
the
court
did
so,
for
example,
in
burlington
industries
v.
ellerth,
where
the
court's
opinion
places
on
the
defendant
the
burden
of
establishing
an
affirmative
defense
in
certain
types
of
sexual
harassment
cases.
there
wasn't
a
textual
basis
for
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
and
--
and
justice
--
in
the
case
of
price
waterhouse,
justice
white
characterized
this
allocation
as
the
burden,
as
an
affirmative
defense.
but
this
sort
of
thing
happens
routinely
with
regard
to
the
allocation
of
burdens.
it
does
not
happen
routinely
with
regard
to
heightened
evidence
requirements.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
--
that's
the
only
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
that
has
been
the
primary
basis
for
the
argument
in
the
courts
below.
i
think
respondent
has
other
arguments
as
well.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
certainly
the
origin.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
would
be
happy
--
i
would
be
happy
to
get
into
it,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
schnapper
as
--
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
there
are
--
there
were
actually
six
members
of
the
court
in
price
waterhouse
who
concurred
in
the
result.
four
members
of
the
court
in
the
plurality
expressly
rejected
a
direct
evidence
requirement
and
said
there
were
no
limits
on
the
type
of
evidence
that
could
be
used.
justice
white
said
that
the
plaintiff's
burden
was
to
show
that
in
that
case
gender
was
a
substantial
factor.
he
didn't
say
substantial
evidence
was
required.
mr.
eric
schnapper
with
due
respect,
no,
your
honor.
it
had
to
do--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--"substantial
factor"
was
somewhere
on
a
scale
of
a
very
unimportant
factor
or
a
very,
very
important
factor,
which
is
separate
from
how
clear
the
evidence
was
that
it
was
a
small
or
large
factor.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
the
--
the
price
waterhouse
plurality
and
justice
white
didn't
see
two
aspects.
the
requirement
was
proof
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
in
that
case
gender
was
a
motivating
factor,
and
for
five
members
of
the
court
that
was
sufficient.
there
wasn't
--
there
wasn't
something
else
that
went
with
it.
there
was
for
justice
o'connor,
but
she's
the
sixth
vote.
and
--
and--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--your
honor,
that's
precisely
the
issue
on
which
the
lower
courts
have
been
divided.
some
courts
have
expressly
rejected
that
view
and
have
taken
the
view
that
there
is
no
special
heightened
standard
of
any
kind.
other
courts
think
that
it
is
required.
that's
what
we
are
--
what--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--yes.
we
--
we
are
obligated
to
do
that,
and
the
--
the
defendant
has
argued
below
and
would,
i
think,
on
remand
still
be
in
a
position
to
argue
that
we
didn't
have
enough
evidence
to
meet
that
burden.
but
that
question
isn't
before
us.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
is
often
tested
by
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
so
courts
do
look
at
that
matter,
that
issue,
before
trial.
what
--
what
isn't
knowable
before
trial
--
and
--
and
frankly
is
often
known
only
to
the
jury
--
is
whether
the
jury
will
conclude
that
the
defendant
acted
with
two
motives
or
one
motive.
that
--
that
isn't
something
you
would
normally
be
able
to
--
to
resolve
before
the
case
went
to
trial
or
even
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
the
--
that's
the
way
it
works.
yes,
that's
the
way
it
works.
and
that
--
that
is
the
way
it
works
in
--
in
a
title
vii
case
because
of
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
juries
routinely
get
that
instruction
in
those
cases.
that's
certainly
proof--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no
more
than
would
normally
be
the
case.
what
happened
here
in
terms
of
jury
instructions
was
typical,
which
was
the
parties
proposed
their
differing
instructions
a
week
before
trial,
the
instructions
were
resolved
at
the
end
of
trial.
that
--
that
happens
all
the
time.
sometimes
if
the
parties
don't
know
how
the
instructions
are
going
to
come
out,
that
complicates
their
tactics,
but
that
happens
every
day
in
trials.
thank
you.
mr.
eric
schnapper
all
right.
there
--
there
were
a
number
of
different
issues
in
the
case.
the
first,
the
court
of
appeals
had
held
that
when
the
burden
is
on
the
employer
to
show
it
would
have
made
the
same
decision
anyway,
the
employer
has
to
meet
that
burden
with
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
the
plurality
and
justice
white,
and
i
think
the
whole
court
rejected
that.
secondly,
the
plurality
suggested
that
the
employer
in
response
would
have
to
have
objective
evidence.
justice
white
rejected
that,
and
the
objective
evidence
standard
has
not
been
followed
by
the
lower
courts
in
--
in
the
wake
of
that.
the
third
question
was
whether
the
burden
should
be
placed
on
the
employer.
on
that
issue,
the
court
was
divided
six
to
three.
six
justices,
as
we
--
as
we
noted,
were
for
that
burden
allocation.
the
--
justice
kennedy
and
--
and
yourself
and
the
chief
justice
dissented.
so
there
were
many
issues.
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the--
mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
in
agreement
with
the
government
that
the
court
should
decide
the
--
the
narrow
question
presented
and
not
revisit
price
waterhouse.
if
i
might
respond
to
the
question
from
justice
breyer
--
and
i
am
going
to
summarize
to
some
extent
materials
which
were
referred
to
in
footnote
18
of
our
reply
brief.
the
tort
rule
--
there
was
a
circumstance,
very
well
established
and
which
under
tort
law
"but
for"
causation
was
not
the
standard.
and
that
was
the
situation
in
corey
versus
havener,
which
is
a
leading
case
in
this
area
in
which
there
were
two
causes,
each
sufficient
to
have
brought
about
the
result.
and
corey
was
a
case
of
two
motorcyclists
who
spooked
a
horse.
and
the
rule
in
those
cases
was
that
--
that
either
cause
--
that
the
tortfeasor
involved
with
either
cause
could
be
held
liable.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
it's
--
it's
--
but
it's
the
analogous
area
of
tort
law--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--the
--
the
problem
that
comes
up
with
multiple
causes
is
it
is
hard
to
reconstruct
what
would
happen.
and
there
is
a
long
line
of
cases,
including
a
number
of
decisions
by
learned
hand
in
1938,
one
of
which
we
have
cited,
transportation
management,
in
which
the
lower
courts
have
agreed
that
where
multiple
factors
are
involved
it's
reasonable
to
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
which
--
of
sorting
it
all
out.
and
we
think
that's
appropriate
here.
thank
you.
