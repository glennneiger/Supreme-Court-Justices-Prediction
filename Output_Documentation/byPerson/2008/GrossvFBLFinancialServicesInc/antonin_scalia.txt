justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
that
--
that
statement
may
be
wrong
depending
upon
how
you
read
price
waterhouse,
might
it
not?
the
first
statement,
that
we've
never
imposed
such
a
requirement.
i
mean,
if
you
think
justice
o'connor's
opinion
was
the
determinative
opinion
in
price
waterhouse,
then
--
then
we
had.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
dictum.
they
may
have
been
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
--
before
you
sit
down,
i
--
i
have
been
trying
to
figure
out
justice
white's
opinion
in
price
waterhouse.
why
--
i
mean,
indeed
he
--
he
voted
to
--
to
remand
the
case,
as
did
--
as
did
the
four
in
the
plurality,
but
for
a
very
different
reason.
they
remanded
because
--
"we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
against
price
waterhouse
because
the
courts
below
erred
by
deciding
that
the
defendant
must
make.
"
the
proof
of
he
would
have
been
fired
anyway
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
that
--
that
was
the
basis
for
their
reversing
and
remanding.
that
was
not
justice
white's,
because
--
he
said,
"because
the
court
of
appeals
required
price
waterhouse
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
it
would
have
reached
the
same
--
in
the
absence
of
the
improper
motive,
rather
than
merely
requiring
proof
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
as
in
mt.
"
"healthy,
i
concur
in
the
judgment
reversing
this
case
in
part
and
remanding.
"
"with
respect
to
the
employer's
burden,
however,
the
plurality
seems
to
require
that
the
employer
submit
objective
evidence.
"
and
he
disagreed
with
that.
