ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
both
on
a
substantive
level
and
a
procedural
level
desert
palace
largely
resolves
this
case.
the
question
presented
is
the
one
of
should
you
have
a
direct
evidence
requirement
to
obtain
a
mixed
motive
instruction
under
the
age
act?
and
there
is
the
procedural
posture,
which
is
desert
palace
left
unresolved
a
lot
of
very
difficult
and
complicated
questions
about
when
do
you
get
to
the
jury
on
mixed
motives
and
what
is
the
requirement
that
separates
a
mixed
motive
motivating
factor
instruction
from
the
"but
for"
or
commonly
known
as
the
mcdonnell
douglas?
and
desert
palace
left
all
that
unresolved.
on
the
question
presented,
there
has
--
the
same
conflict
in
the
circuits
under
the
age
act
is
the
same
conflict
in
the
circuits
that
was
under
title
vii
--
is,
do
you
need
any
kind
of
evidentiary
special
showing
to
get
to
a
mixed
motive,
and,
if
so,
is
it
noncircumstantial
evidence
or
evidence
that
directly
ties--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
think
there's
a
lot
to
be
said
for
that
argument,
and
this
is
a
very
difficult
and
unsettled
question
under
title
vii.
i
think
what
would
be
on
the
table
if
this
court
ever
had
an
appropriate
vehicle
--
and
this
certainly
is
not
the
appropriate
vehicle
to
get
into
this
question
--
there
would
be
several
options
on
the
table.
you
could
have
what
your
view
suggests,
which
is
after
summary
judgment
you
could
get
a
motivating
factor
instruction,
that
the
jury
would
be
permitted
to
find
both
impermissible
and
permissible
motives.
you
could
also
have
a
special
verdict
form
that
asks
the
jury:
do
you
find
that
there
were
two
causes,
one
of
which
was
an
impermissible
factor?
and
you
could
have
a
situation
which
i
think
prevails
in
trial
courts
now
--
and
has
been
the
eeoc's
practice
--
which
is
--
and
it's
not
the
most
analytically
clean,
but
they
basically
give
the
instruction,
either
a
determinative
cause
or
motivating
factor
instruction,
on
what
they
think
best
fits
the
evidence.
and
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
understand,
as
we
--
the
law
exists
now
under
title
vii
and
under
all
the
other
anti-discrimination
acts,
there
are
two
regimes
out
there.
there's
a
mixed
motive
regime
and
a
determining
factor
regime.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
but
this
is
--
i
will
also
give
you,
which
i
think
is
important,
especially
when
you
write
your
opinion,
the
three
reasons
why
you
should
not
resolve
this
very
difficult
question
in
this
case.
and
the
first
is
that
it
wasn't
pressed
or
passed
on
below
or
raised
in
the
brief
in
opposition
and
did
not
receive
full
briefing
by
the
parties
and
all
the
amici.
and,
second,
just
as
you
left
this
issue
open
in
footnote
1
of
your
opinion
in
desert
palace,
judge
colloton
writing
for
the
court
recognized
this
precise
issue
in
footnote
3
of
the
court's
opinion
on
petition
appendix
page
12,
saying:
assuming
there
is
no
direct
evidence
requirement,
we
are
going
to
have
to
figure
out
when
is
it
appropriate
to
give
a
motivating
factor
instruction,
absent
the
--
the
language,
express
language
in
title
vii.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
third
reason--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
see
your
point,
even
though
that's
exactly
what
you
did
in
desert
palace.
but
price
waterhouse
is
a
2-decade-old
decision.
we're
20
years
past
that,
and
it
has
been
essentially
codified
in
title
vii.
so
no
matter
what
you
do
to,
quote
unquote,
vii,
and
a
motivating
factor
instruction
is
codified,
and
you
unanimously
held
in
desert
palace
there's
no
special
evidentiary
requirement.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
unless
you
overrule
price
waterhouse,
which
would
be
an
upheaval
in
the
law,
and
certainly
--
this
wouldn't
be
the
appropriate
case
to
do
it,
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
unanimously
held
under
the
age
act
and
under
a
wide
variety
of
state
statutes
and
other
federal
discrimination
statutes
that
the
price
waterhouse
burden-shifting
framework
applies.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right,
but
i
don't
think
you
need
to
decide
that
question.
in
a
lot
of
other
contexts,
you
have
said,
well,
there's
language
in
our
opinion
that
may
have
been
confusing
or
it's
not
clear
what
the
holding
is,
but
we
henceforth
are
going
to
clarify,
here's
what
the
law
is.
you
did
it
in
the
recent
crack
cocaine
case
in
spears,
you
did
it
in
your
nude
dancing
case,
and
you
did
it
in
a
case
called
jefferson
v.
city
of
tarrant
--
county,
an
opinion
justice
ginsburg
authored,
that
you
said:
well,
there's
some
language
here
that
subsequent
cases
have
made
clear,
and
there's
lots
of
reasons
why
you
would
not
impose
a
"direct
evidence"
requirement,
however
you
define
that
term.
since
desert
palace,
there
is
the
decision
of
sprint/united
v.
mendelsohn.
and
i
think
that
case
a
fortiori
forecloses
all
the
arguments
made
by
the
other
side
that,
well,
even
if
it
doesn't
mean
non-circumstantial
evidence,
it
must
mean
something
that
is
highly
relevant
to
the
issue
of
discrimination.
in
sprint/united,
you
said:
we're
not
going
to
have
a
per
se
rule
about
what's
relevant
to
prove
discrimination.
the
court
said
the
same
thing
in
reeves.
i
think
that
was
a
unanimous
decision.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
you
would
still
have
the
same
issue
as
you
have
under
the
constitutional
regime
of
what
is
causation?
and
if
you
asked
my
opinion,
the
solicitor
general
in
--
in
price
waterhouse
itself
argued
something
different
that
no
justice
adopted.
we
argued
a
standard
of
causation
that
no
one
--
no
one
was
persuaded
by.
six
went
off
on
this
motivating
factor
with
the
burden-shifting
approach,
and
three
of
the
justices
would
have
applied
a
straight
"but
for"
causation--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--and
it--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--absolutely.
and
it
did
in
title
vii,
and
this
court,
for
better
or
worse
--
regardless
of
what
you
think
--
in
price
waterhouse,
six
justices
defined
the
language
"because
of".
and
we
have
price
waterhouse
now
that
is
codified.
and
so--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no.
let
me
just
say
two
responses.
not
that
i
have
seen
empirical.
i
can
tell
you
the
eeoc's
experience,
and
that
is
they
sometimes
prefer
a
"but
for"
all
the
burden
being
on
them,
and
sometimes
they
prefer
the
motivating
factor
instruction.
and
despite
what
respondent
points
out,
they
have
some
defendants
that
think
they
like
the
affirmative
defense.
so
i
--
and
sometimes
counsel
just
agree
on
what
the
instruction
should
be.
and
it
hasn't
caused
that
much
of
a
problem,
although
there
is
a
lot
of
confusion
about
this
kind
of
case,
where
the
defendant
is
insisting
on
one
instruction
and
the
plaintiff
wants
another
instruction.
and
that's
what
judge
colloton
is
reserving
in
a
footnote
saying:
on
remand
i
am
going
to
have
to
sort
this
out.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
mean
--
there
are
two
kinds
of
jury
findings.
there's
the
--
but
the
problem
in
all
this
area,
if
you
do
ever
get
a
case
that's
appropriate,
i
think
what
the
court
should
start
with
the
assumption
which
justice
alito
alluded
to:
price
waterhouse
was
a
bench
trial.
the
1991
amendments
under
title
vii
were
against
the
backdrop
of
non-jury
trials.
and
both
the
price
waterhouse
decision
and
the
language
of
title
vii
are
written
ex
post.
what
--
it's
assuming
some
artificial
world
where
there
was
a
finding
of
mixed
motives.
but
in
today's
world
everything
needs
to
be
done
ex
ante.
we
need
to
know
how
to
instruct
the
jury,
and
that's
the
fundamental
problem.
if
you
are
looking
at
ex
post
world,
you
are
exactly
right.
a
jury
could
either
find
this
was
all
a
pretext,
i
think
what
was
really
going
on
was
ageism
or
sexism
or
racism,
or
it
could
find,
a
"split
the
baby",
i
think
it's
both.
but
you
just
can't
possibly
know
that--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--going
in.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
think
you
are
basically
catching
on
the
point
that
a
lot
of
counsel
in
the
real
world
are
basically
deciding,
what
do
we
think
the
jury
is
going
to
be
most
on
our
side
with,
with
which
instruction?
and
it's
not
always
clear
going
into
the
case,
maybe
depending
on
the
relative
strength
of
the
legitimate
factor
being
asserted.
some
defendants
may
prefer
the
affirmative
defense.
some
may
think,
no,
it's
prejudicial,
we
don't
want
that,
we
want
a
straight
determining-factor
instruction.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
i
don't
think
you
can
ditch
price
waterhouse
as
a
practical
matter,
because
you're
going
to
create
--
i
mean
--
massive
confusion,
not
only
under
the
age
act,
but
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act,
the
family
medical
leave
act,
a
variety
of
labor
statutes,
disability
statutes--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
you
can
do
that,
but
all
the
problems
you
think
you
are
solving,
you
are
going
to
have
to
face
them
in
title
vii.
that
is
the
bulk
of
discrimination
law,
and
you
have
two
standards
of
causation
in
that
statute
right
now.
thank
you.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
oh,
on
why
you
shouldn't
decide
it?
i
mean,
it's
essentially
this:
that
this
is
complicated,
difficult
under
title
vii.
that's
the
leading
anti-discrimination
statute.
i
think
the
court
may
want
to
resolve
these
very
legitimate
important
questions
in
a
title
vii
case,
because
you
have
got
statutory
language.
