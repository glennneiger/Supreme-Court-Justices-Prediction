mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
does
seem
to
me
in
some
ways
the
petitioner
and
respondent
in
this
case
are
ships
passing
in
the
night
because
the
issues
here
are
unbelievably
complicated.
i
will
say
in
25
years
of
advocacy
before
this
court
i
have
not
seen
one
area
of
the
law
that
seems
to
me
as
difficult
to
sort
out
as
this
particular
one
is.
that
said,
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
seize
upon
this
as
an
opportunity
to
provide
some
significant
clarity
in
the
law,
rather
than
seize
this
as
an
opportunity
to
decide
this
case
on
the
potentially
most
narrow
ground,
which,
frankly,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
will
not
only
not
decide
this
case,
ultimately,
but
certainly
will
not
do
anything
to
resolve
the
mass
confusion
that
seems
to
exist
among
the
lower
courts.
so,
i
would
urge
the
court
not
to
evaluate
this
case
strictly
on
the
question
of
whether
direct
versus
circumstantial
evidence
is
the
appropriate
way
to
proceed.
in
part
that's
because
that's
not
the
basis
on
which
the
eighth
circuit
decided
this
case.
the
eighth
circuit
said
that
it
interpreted
justice
o'connor's
separate
opinion
calling
for
direct
evidence
as
talking
about
a
specific
link
between
the
proof
--
in
the
proof
of
the
discriminatory
considerations
and
the
adverse
action
that
was
taken.
so,
direct
versus
circumstantial
doesn't
even
--
you
know,
if
you
remand
to
--
to
evaluate
non-circumstantial
evidence,
you
are
still
not
going
to
be
in
a
position
where
that's
going
to
affect
the
outcome.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
then
--
of
course,
they
go
on
to
say
what
they
think
that
decision
means.
but
there's
no
question,
justice
ginsburg,
that
that
is
the
basis
for
that
holding.
so,
i
mean,
i
suppose
the
court
could
say,
no,
we
disagree
with
the
basis
of
price
waterhouse
as
justice
white's
separate
concurring
opinion,
which,
frankly,
i
think
it
is
--
you
know,
having
read
it
more
times
than
i
care
to
admit,
is
not
exactly
clear
as
to
what
he
thinks
the
appropriate
standard
would
have
been.
at
least
justice
ginsburg's
provides
a
formulation
that
the
lower
courts
can
use
to
try
to
provide
some
kind
of
a
jury
instruction--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--did
i
say
ginsburg?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
going
to
hear
about
this
one.
[laughter]
i
apologize.
but
the
problem
--
you
know,
the
--
but
the
fundamental
problem
is,
it's
just
simply
not
clear
what
justice
white's
opinion
means.
and,
therefore,
the
lower
courts
have
seized
upon
an
opinion
that
at
least
provided
serious
guidance
that
they
could
embody
into
--
into
a
jury
instruction.
it
goes
to
the
point
that
justice
alito
was
making,
which
is
that,
you
know,
it's
one
thing
when
you
are
dealing
with
bench
trials
and
what
do
you
ask
the
judge
to
do.
it's
something
fundamentally
different
when
you
are
shifting
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
kennedy
asked
the
question,
does
it
make
a
difference
tactically?
the
same
question
justice
souter
in
some
ways
was
asking.
and
the
answer
is
clearly
it
does,
and
you
can
see
it
in
this
case.
here's
a
situation
where
the
defendant
prior
to
the
trial
shows
up,
or
when
the
jury
gets
selected.
opening
statement
says
there
is
going
to
be
no
evidence
of
actual
age
discrimination
in
this
case.
the
case
is
tried
on
that
theory.
the
basis
for
the
judgment
that
there's
going
to
be
no
evidence
of
age
discrimination
in
this
case
is
the
discovery,
extensive
discovery
that
has
taken
place,
where
there
is
no
statements
by
anyone
talking
about
age,
no
other
employee
who
believes
that
he
or
she
had
been
ever
been
affected
by
age.
it's
all
of
this
very
abstract
claim
and
the
notion
that
somehow
there's
no
better
explanation
for
what
happened
except
for
age.
you
go
through
the
entirety
of
the
trial
saying
to
the
jury,
there's
no
evidence
of
age,
there's
no
evidence
of
age
discrimination,
and
then
at
the
last
minute,
not
because
you
have
asserted
an
affirmative
defense
--
because
we
didn't
assert
an
affirmative
defense
--
one
is
foisted
on
us
by
the
jury
instruction
that
the
plaintiff
asked
for
in
this
particular
case,
that
says
that
if
there
is
a
motivating
factor,
if
you
can
prove
a
motivating
factor
--
which
it's
interesting
to
get
to
the
specifics
of
a
motivating
factor,
which
means
it
played
a
part
or
a
role,
which
is
about
as
minimalist
as
you
can
have
it
--
then
the
burden
shifts,
and
we
then
have
the
burden
to
prove
that
we
would
have
taken
the
same
action
notwithstanding
age.
well,
that's
a
very
different
inquiry,
and
when
you
go
to
the
jury
at
the
end,
you
can't
concede--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't
believe
he
would
be
required
to
enter
judgment
for
the
defendant.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but
i
--
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
jury
--
it
would
be
fair
to
ask
the
jury
to
decide
which
of
those
two
considerations
probably
played
the
greater
role.
but
i
think
--
and
that's
why
i
think
taking
it
to
the
jury
is
one
thing.
switching
the
burden
of
proof
to
insist
that
we
prove
that
the
--
that
the
nondiscriminatory
ground
was
the
primary
reason
for
the
decision
is
--
is
an
inappropriate
way
to
proceed
because
there
is
no
basis
in
the
statute
for
that.
the
plaintiff
still
retains
the
burden
to
prove
that
there
was
discrimination
"because
of".
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
sufficient
to
get
to
the
jury,
because
i
don't
think
we
have
to
prove
--
i
don't
think
the
plaintiff
has
to
prove,
you
know,
obviously,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
anything.
i
mean,
i
think
the
jury
could
fairly
say
that
those
are
the
two
grounds.
and
i
think
in
some
ways
that
--
that
is
the
sort
of
commonsense
basis
on
which
price
waterhouse
was
decided.
and
it's
--
you
know,
it's
important
--
if
--
you
know,
the
chamber
of
commerce
brief
actually
focuses
a
great
deal,
justice
stevens,
on
this
multi-member
decisionmaking
body.
and
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
look
at
cases
like
mount
healthy
and
price
waterhouse,
those
are
all
cases
where
you
have
multi-member
decisionmakers,
and
some
of
whom
may
have
expressed
some
biases
and
others
of
whom
clearly
didn't,
and
how
do
you
deal
with
that
situation,
which
impresses
me
as
fundamentally
different
than
the
situation
here
where
you
have
a
single
supervisor
dealing
with
a
single
employee
and
where
the
case
is
tried
on
the
theory
that
there
has
been
no
discrimination
whatsoever,
and
it's
up
to
the
jury
to
make
that
determination
at
the
end,
and
at
the
last
minute
we
have
the
jury
instruction
that
shifts
the
burden
to
us
notwithstanding
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--we
never
sought
to
make
this
an
affirmative
defense.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
that's
the
banner
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
played
a
role.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
it
did.
that's
what--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it's
on
page
10
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and,
justice--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--can
i
just
--
if
you
go
to
the
next
instruction--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
says
a
--
"plaintiff's
age
was
"a
motivating
factor",
if
plaintiff's
age
played
a
part
or
a
role
in
the
defendant's
decision.
"
so
"a
motivating
factor"
is
a
very
narrow
formulation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--as
instructed
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean
--
in
the
first
place,
saying
that
something
is
a
motivating
factor
or
played
a
role
is
--
as
a
sufficient
basis
on
which
to
impose
liability,
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
has
said
numerous
time.
it
said
it
in
burdine,
it
said
it
in
reeves,
it
said
it
in
hazen
paper,
it
said
it
i
think
last
term
in
a
kentucky
case,
where
it
says
it
has
to
play
a
role
and
be
determinative.
and
that's
the
standard
the
court
has
announced
over
and
over
again
in
age
discrimination
cases.
the
vii,
but
that's
because
of
the
1991
statute
that
specifically
frames
the
argument
in
terms
of
"a
motivating
factor".
so
the
--
the
bottom
line
here
is
that,
unless
the
court
deviates
from
the
historic
practice,
which
is
if
you
are
in
civil
litigation
the
plaintiff
retains
the
burden
of
proof
throughout
the
process--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
my
basic
point
on
price
waterhouse
is
that
it
seemed
to
me
reasonably
clear
that
a
majority
of
the
court,
whether
you
--
whether
you
rely
upon
justice
white
or
justice
o'connor
--
clearly
didn't
intend
for
the
jury
--
for
the
burden
of
proof
to
shift
willy-nilly.
but
it's
supposed
to
be
an
exception
to
the
rule,
narrowly
defined.
and
the
reality--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--played
--
played
a
role.
there's
no
question
about
that,
justice
ginsburg,
but
that
is
not
much
different,
frankly,
from
a
prima
facie
showing.
the
truth
is,
if
you
only
make
a
prima
facie
showing
and
the
defendant
doesn't
show
up,
you
will
have
in
fact
satisfied
your
burden.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there's
no
question
--
i
mean,
although,
again,
what
a
motivating
factor
means
is
still
to
my
mind
extraordinarily
narrow
in
this--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--or
limited
in
terms
of
what's
required
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but,
justice--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--clearly
he
would
win
under
those
circumstances,
but
the
problem
there
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
he
doesn't
lose,
but
the
question
is,
what
do
you
do
once
you
make
that
finding?
do
you,
in
fact,
at
the
plaintiff's
behest,
shift
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
defendant?
i
mean,
it's
one
thing
--
and
--
and
the
solicitor
general,
you
know,
has
properly
identified
that
in
some
instances
the
defendants
as
a
tactical
matter
are
willing
to
accept
as
an
affirmative
defense
and
--
and
pursue
the
course
you
just
articulated,
justice
stevens.
but
that's
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
we
were
not
prepared
to
accept
the
idea
that
age
played
a
role
in
this
case.
we
still
don't
think
the
evidence
supports
that.
that's
obviously
not
the
issue
here
before
us,
but
it
does
make
it
extremely
important
to
resolve
the
question
of,
at
what
stage
can
you
foist,
essentially--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--an
affirmative
defense
on
the
other
side?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
am
always
reluctant
to
say
that,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that,
in
ordinary
tort
law,
the
standard
of
causation
is
both
a
combination
of
"but
for"
and
proximate
causation,
so--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
a
fair--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
ginsburg,
at
least
as
i
read
the
difference
between
the
plurality
opinion
in
price
waterhouse
and
--
and
all
of
the
other
opinions
in
that
case,
price
waterhouse's
plurality
said
a
motivating
factor
is
actually
a
standard
below
"but
for"
causation.
the
plurality
was
unwilling
to
accept
even
"but
for"
causation
as
a
requirement
under
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act.
the
--
the
rest
of
the
justices
seemed
to
not
--
not
accept
that.
but
that
seems
to
me
the
very
--
yes,
the
basic
holding
of
the
plurality
--
again,
not
of
the
court
--
is
that
something
less
than
"but
for"
causation
is
required.
i
would
be
delighted,
candidly,
if
the
court
would
go
back
to
just
"but
for"
causation
as
the
element
of
age
discrimination
because
i
think,
if
you
get
to
that
point,
you
get
out
of
this
business
of
trying
to
figure
out
at
what
point
you
shift
the
burden.
if
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
to
be
clear
about
this,
i'm
not
pushing
so
much
the,
quote,
mcdonnell
douglas
framework
as
i
am
burdine,
hazen
paper,
and
the
other
cases
that
talk
about
"determinative
factor".
and
--
and
all
--
all
we're
saying
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--determinative
factor,
right.
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question,
justice
ginsburg,
is
the
--
the
way
the
chief
justice
asked
the
question,
which
is,
how
sensible
is
it
to
pull
the
one
thread
out
of
the
--
out
of
the
price
waterhouse
analysis,
assuming
that
justice
o'connor
speaks
for
the
court
in
some
sense,
you
know,
without
examining
how
that
plays
in,
given
the
underlying
theory
of
the
case?
and
i
think
that's
a
perfectly
valid
point.
if
the
court
thinks
additional
briefing
is
warranted,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
the
right
answer
is
to
--
is
to
call
for
additional
briefing,
but
i
think--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
justice
kennedy
--
clearly
not
going
to
affect
title
vii.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
clearly
isn't
going
to
affect
title
vii.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
because
there's
a
specific
statute
that
defines
it
as
a
motivating
factor,
shifts
the
burden,
and
creates
an
entire
remedial
regime
that
doesn't
exist
under
the
age
discrimination
statute.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
the
primary
one
is
the
1991
amendment,
where
congress
clearly
changed
the
language
in
title
vii.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
seems
to
me
it's
beyond
that.
i
mean,
there's
almost
a
separation
of
powers
problem
when
you
say
it's
statutory
because,
again,
congress
very
consciously
decided
to
modify
title
vii,
created
a
complete
regime.
it
would
be
a
bit
of
a
stretch
for
this
court
not
only
to
modify
the
standards
in
a
way
that
would
change
substantive
liability
but
would
create
the
--
the
affirmative
defense
as
a
remedial
component
of
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
both
congress
and
this
court
have
recognized
precisely
that
as
a
problem.
i
mean,
there
are
reasons
to
treat
age
discrimination
differently
from
other
forms
of
discrimination.
but,
again,
you
know,
there's
no
question
that
if
you
revisit
price
waterhouse,
it
will
change
some
--
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
and
some
of
the
other
provisions.
but
the
reality
is,
if
you
are
talking
about
a
mess
to
begin
with,
the
truth
is
the
lower
courts
are
in
a
state
of
--
of
disrepair
at
this
point
in
any
event.
and
it's
even
shown
in
this
case.
i
mean,
the
truth
is
the
eighth
circuit
has
three
different
formulations
of
justice
o'connor's
direct
evidence
standard:
circumstantial,
strong
evidence,
and
substantial
evidence,
substantial
factor.
so
if
you
are
a
district
court
judge
sitting
in
the
eighth
circuit,
you
can
pick
any
one
of
those
--
those
three
to
go
with.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
i
believe
it
could.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes
--
i
mean,
if
you
were
asking
me
how
i
would
decide
that
case,
yes,
i
think
it
ought
to
be
--
it
ought
to
be
"because
of".
now,
if
the
court
wants
to
formulate
some
greater
specificity
of
how
the
causation
standards
apply,
that's
fine.
but,
at
a
minimum,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
would
do
well
to
go
back
at
least
to
the
notion
of
"but
for"
causation
as
embodied
in
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
has
never
rejected
that
as
a
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
--
it
seems
to
me
juries
are
asked
to
make
that
kind
of
a
decision.
i
agree
with
justice
souter:
juries
are
a
lot
smarter
than
the
lawyers.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
and
i
understand
that.
and
in
those
situations
--
look,
justice
o'connor's
analysis
of
this
certainly
--
certainly
plays
to
a
kind
of
gut
feeling.
when
you
--
and
mount
healthy
is
a
good
illustration
of
it,
even
maybe
more
so,
when
you
say:
we
are
firing
you
for
two
reasons;
one
of
them
is
completely
invalid,
and
the
other
one
is
completely
valid.
what
are
you
supposed
to
do
in
that
situation?
but
it
seems
to
me
that
under
--
under
normal
civil
litigation
rules,
and
the
ones
that
congress
clearly
had
in
its
mind,
the
approach
you
would
take
under
those
circumstances
say
that's
enough
to
get
you
to
the
jury,
but
that's
not
enough
to
force
the
jury
to
be
instructed
that
they
have
to
rule
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
unless
the
defendant
can
show
that
but
for
--
that
--
that
no
matter
--
regardless
of
the
discriminatory
animus,
they
nevertheless
would
have
taken
precisely
the
same
action.
that,
to
me,
is
the
guts
of
--
of
what
--
of
what
this
case
is
about.
it's
not
about
direct
versus
circumstantial
evidence.
it's
about
under
what
circumstances
does
the
burden
of
proof
shift?
and
--
and
in
a
case
like
this
where
there's
no
assertion
of
an
affirmative
defense
--
whereas,
i
think,
justice
stevens,
in
your
situation,
there
were
--
you
know,
most
likely
you
would
expect
a
defendant
to
say,
i
want
to
accept
that
burden
because
i
think
i
can
in
fact
prove
something.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
--
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
it's
--
again,
the
only
question
is:
who
bears
the
burden
of
proof?
and
what
do
you
do
with
all
of
those
decisions
of
this
court
that
say
that
the
--
that
the
--
burden
to
--
to
show
that
age,
or
whatever,
was
the
determinative
factor
rests
throughout
on
the
plaintiff?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
--
to
the
question
that
justice
alito
posed
actually,
to
say
--
when
he
asked
her:
how
do
you
--
how
much
sense
does
it
make
to
think
about
mixed
motive
versus
other
motive?
isn't
it
true
that
by
the
time
the
case
gets
to
the
jury,
everything
is
mixed
motive,
because
there
is
going
to
be
the
claim
that
this
was
--
and
this
is
a
great
illustration
of
that
concept.
there's
a
claim
that
age
was
the
basis
for
the
decision,
and
then
there's
a
claim
that
there
are
any
of
a
thousand
other
possible
reasons
that
are
out
there,
and
age
just
didn't
happen
to
be
one.
and
under
those
circumstances
the
question
is:
what's
the
reasonable
way
to
proceed?
now,
justice
ginsburg,
i
apologize
that
we
didn't
raise
this
specifically
in
the
brief
in
opposition.
on
the
other
hand,
the
reality
is
that
the
primary
position
that
was
taken
by
the
other
side
was
that
this
court
essentially
can
ignore
or
should
overrule
a
portion
of
price
waterhouse
as
a
consequence
of
the
--
of
the
intervening
costa
decision.
and
it
seems
to
me
under
those
circumstances,
if
you
are
going
to
put
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
price
waterhouse
--
whatever
it
means
--
at
issue,
then
it
seems
to
us
a
reasonable
response
on
the
merits
to
say,
well,
you
shouldn't
do
it
as
--
as
a
--
in
isolation.
that
that's
a
completely
artificial
inquiry,
and
you
ought
to
take
a
step
back
and
say,
maybe
we
haven't
gotten
this
right
in
the
first
place,
particularly
given
the
difficulty
of
the
lower
courts
in
trying
to
figure
out
exactly
what
price
waterhouse
means.
whose
is
the
controlling
opinion,
and
how
do
you
allocate
these
burdens
and
under
what
circumstances?
and
given
that
the
lower
courts
are
in
disarray,
it
would
seem
to
me
this
is
a
situation
where
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
the
best
vehicle
or
the
worst
vehicle,
but
it
is
certainly
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
the
court
to
step
back
and
evaluate
it.
and
if
the
court
is
concerned
about
whether
it
has
enough
information
to
allow
it
to
assess
what
would
be
the
--
the
significant
impact
of
revising
price
waterhouse,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
right
answer
would
be
to
ask
the
parties
to
--
to
brief
that
in
addition
to
the
way
they
briefed
it
at
this
stage.
not
to
simply
throw
up
your
hands.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
--
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg.
i
--
i
don't
think
there
are
any
--
any
guidelines
out
there
that
speak
directly
to
this
specific
question.
but,
obviously,
to
the
extent
that
the
solicitor
general
could
speak
for
the
eeoc,
that
would
--
i
am
not
denying
that
that
would
--
that
might
be
helpful.
but
i
think
what
the
--
what
the
court
needs
to
do
is
recognize
that
what
it
cannot
--
what
it
should
not
do
in
this
case
is
take
the
--
the
very
narrowest
way
of
vacating
and
remanding.
because
if
it
follows
that
course,
nothing
will
move.
nothing
will
have
been
achieved
by
all
the
work
that
has
been
put
into
this
case
at
this
point,
because
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
believe
the
difference
was
between
direct
and
circumstantial
evidence.
and,
therefore,
the
court
at
some
point
is
going
to
have
to
evaluate
beyond
the
quality
of
the
evidence
what
quantity
of
evidence
is
appropriate
under
the
circumstances.
it
seems
to
me
the
court
has
that
in
front
of
it.
the
jury
instruction
in
this
case
shifted
the
burden
way
too
early
or
on
--
on
way
too
little
showing.
a
part,
a
role,
that's
not
enough
to
shift
the
burden
under
--
i
don't
even
think
under
justice
white's
version.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
is
a
question
about
the
adequacy
of
the
jury
instruction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
no,
i
don't
--
there's
no
question
that
--
that
--
well,
there
is
a
question
on
that.
it's
not
before
you.
it's
--
it's
back
in
front
of
the
eighth
circuit.
but
there
is
still
the
issue
of
whether
a
motivating
factor,
meaning
that
it
played
a
role,
is
a
sufficient
basis
on
which
to
trigger
the
--
the
burden-shifting
instruction
in
this
case.
that
--
that
is
the
narrowest
basis
on
which
this
court
could
affirm
by
simply
saying
that
justice
white's
opinion
requires
a
substantial
showing.
the
instruction
in
this
case
clearly
doesn't
accomplish
that,
and,
therefore,
the
court
should
set
that
aside,
or
the
court
should
affirm
the
eighth
circuit
and
remand
so
that
the
district
court
can
have
a
new
trial
on
that
issue.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
urge
the
court
to
affirm.
