now,
would
the
--
if
there
is
a
direct
evidence
requirement,
it
may
arguably
cause
a
great
deal
of
problem
when
the
trial
judge
has
to
give
an
instruction
to
the
jury,
because
then
the
--
the
jury
will
first
have
to
decide
whether
a
particular
type
of
evidence
is
present
in
the
case
before
it
can
tell
what
--
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
and
what
the
standard
is.
but
if
price
waterhouse
is
understood
simply
as
a
way
for
a
judge
conducting
a
bench
trial
to
look
at
the
evidence,
does
it
present
any
of
the
problems
that
have
been
identified
with
the
price
waterhouse
--
that
interpretation
of
price
waterhouse
as
applied
to
jury
trials?

well,
if
it's
just
an
instruction
to
a
judge
conducting
a
bench
trial,
it
could
mean
that
if
the
--
if
the
judge
sitting
as
the
trier
of
fact
finds
that
there
is
direct
evidence,
strong
evidence
supporting
the
plaintiff's
claim,
then
the
judge
will
need
to
have
strong
evidence,
stronger
evidence
on
the
other
side
in
order
to
rule
against
the
plaintiff.
it's
not
hard
to
figure
out
how
it
might
work
out
in
that
situation.
the
problem
comes
when
it
has
to
be
posed
in
the
form
of
a
jury
instruction.

justice

can
i
ask
you
this?
do
you
think
that
there
is
a
tenable
distinction
between
a
mixed
motives
case
and
a
non-mixed
motives
case?
in
every
employment
discrimination
case
that
gets
beyond
summary
judgment,
aren't
there
mixed
motives
at
play?

is
there
any
--
is
there
any
empirical
evidence
to
show
whether
any
of
this
really
makes
a
difference.
have
there
been
studies
on
the
effect
of
the
1991
amendments,
whether
they
have
made
a
difference
in
the
way
cases
actually
come
out?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

well,
in
addition
to
that,
mr.
phillips,
isn't
age
more
closely
correlated
with
legitimate
reasons
for
employment
discrimination
than
race
and
other
factors
that
are
proscribed
by
title
vii?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
don't
those
cases
involve
two
independent
physical
causes
of
an
event,
not
the
breaking
down
of
human
motivation
into
--
into
separate
factors?
