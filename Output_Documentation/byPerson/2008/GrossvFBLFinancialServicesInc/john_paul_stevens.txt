mr.
phillips,
can
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
ask
you
your
views
on
a
question
that
i've
asked
myself
over
and
over
again
and
had
trouble
finding
the
answer?
supposing
a
company
appointed
a
committee
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
fire
x.
and
the
committee
came
back
and
said:
yes,
you
should
fire
him.
he's
too
old,
and
he's
late
to
work
every
day.
now
--
and
that's
all
the
evidence
in
the
record.
would
the
--
would
the
judge
be
obliged
to
enter
a
judgment
on
summary
judgment
--
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
to
enter
judgment
for
the
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
all
that
would
have
been
proved
was
that
there
was
one
motivating
factor
there,
but
not
necessarily
a
decisive
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
has
only
proved
that
it
had
been
one
of
two
possible
motivating
factors.
but
that's
sufficient
in
your
view
to
get
to
the
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips,
let
me
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
one
thing.
if
it's
a
motivating
factor,
it's
enough
to
get
by
summary
judgment
and
get
the
case
to
the
jury,
but
the
--
the
defendant
will
still
win,
if
i
understand
all
this,
if
he
--
if
the
defendant
proves,
yes,
i
did
do
and
it
may
have
had
an
influence
on
it,
but
we
would
have
fired
him
anyway.
and
if
he
--
if
he
can
prove
under
mount
healthy
that,
yes,
he
thought
about
age
and
that
--
what
raised
the
issue
and
everything
else,
but
after
he
got
all
through,
he
was
clear
he
fired
him
because
he
was
a
lousy
salesman--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
he
wins.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
does
not
lose
just
because
you
say
it's
a
motivating
factor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
not
only
that,
but
the
jury
would
be
free
to
say,
well,
there
were
both
causes,
and
the
one
was
illegal.
but
under
the
mount
healthy
defense,
if
they
are
convinced
they
would
have
fired
this
guy
anyway,
the
company
gets
off.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
inevitably
in
these
cases
the
employer
is
really
--
whether
he
calls
it
an
affirmative
defense
or
--
or
just
a
regular
resistance
to
the
plaintiff's
case,
the
issue
is:
did
--
would
he
have
fired
him
anyway?
and
--
and
if
he
--
if
--
if
that's
what
the
jury
believes,
you
can
take
justice
breyer's
view
and
say
that's
--
that's
not
a
sufficient
defense
because
they
acted
illegally.
but
if
you
are
allowed
that,
you
are
saying,
notwithstanding
the
illegal
motive,
if
you
show
that
the
real
reason
i
fired
him
was
unrelated
to
that,
then
--
the
compelling
reason
--
you
win.
and
you
win
despite
the
fact
that
the
process
may
have
violated
the
statute.
