justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
don't
you
follow
what
the
eeoc
says?
i
mean,
the
eeoc,
as
i
understand
it,
has
said
the
very
fact
the
employer
has
initiated
an
investigation
of
an
alleged
discrimination
is
sufficient
to
demonstrate
the
reasonableness
of
the
employee's
belief
that
by
providing
information
relevant
to
the
inquiry
she
is
opposing
an
employment
practice
made
unlawful
by
title
vii.
and
then
they
go
on.
to
be
absolutely
clear
about
it,
they
say
an
employee
who
assists
her
or
her
employer
in
the
endeavor,
i.e.,
you
go
and
testify;
so
the
sun
was
shining
on
that
day;
you
are
assisting
your
employee
by
telling
the
truth
--
is
by
definition
--
is
opposing
practices
made
unlawful
by
title
vii.
so
here
we
have
a
difficult
question,
quite
an
interstitial
question,
defining
precisely
eeoc
doing
it.
so
why
don't
we
just
follow
what
they
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
a
real
problem?
i
mean,
let's
suppose
the
opposition
clause
protects
everybody
in
the
internal
investigation
who
could
be
at
all
interpreted
as
favorable
to
the
complainant.
it
also
protects
everybody
who
could
possibly
be
viewed
as
neutral.
then
you
have
a
problem
about
what
about
a
person
who
loves
sexual
harassment?
this
is
the
hypothetical:
he
comes
in,
testifies:
i
love
sexual
harassment;
it's
wonderful,
and
they
fire
him.
now
is
this
a
real
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
with
that
is
that
i
--
while
i
have
the
eeoc
with
me,
say,
on
--
assuming
your
thing
--
on,
from
what
i
read,
on
the
opposition
clause,
when
i
looked
into
what
the
eeoc
actually
said
here
on
the
participation
clause,
i
don't
think
i
can
characterize
it,
except
for
their
litigation
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can't
characterize
what
they've
said
in
their
compliance
manual
as
being
with
you
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
could
easily
change
it.
they
could
easily
change
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
it's
not
in
their
manual.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
isn't
even
--
look,
the
best
way
to
oppose
a
crime
is
to
cooperate
with
the
police
when
they
investigate
individual
instances.
the
best
way
to
oppose
sexual
discrimination
in
the
workplace
is
to
cooperate
with
the
employer
when,
in
fact,
he
investigates
individual
instances.
is
what
i've
just
said
english?
does
it
make
sense?
and
indeed,
i'm
just
quoting
the
eeoc's
own
definition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
your
opinion.
the
eeoc's
opinion
is,
as
they
state,
the
best
way
to
oppose
is
to
cooperate.
now,
what
are
we
to
do
with,
at
least
ambiguity,
giving
you
that,
i'll
give
you
ambiguity.
but
we
have
the
agency
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
this
taking
the
side
of
it
that
is
the
opposite
side
that
you
are
taking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
a
mix.
i
mean,
you
know,
a
lot
of
plaintiffs
might
be
afraid
to
bring
these
cases
because
they'll
be
accused
of
doing
all
kinds
of
bad
things.
they
don't
want
their
reputations
ruined.
they
have
lawyers
who
take
contingent
fees
because
they
have
to
pay
for
it.
oh
the
other
hand,
you
have
problems
with
your
costs
and
you
have
problems
dismissing
people
who
should
be
dismissed.
everybody
has
problems
in
this
area.
that's
why
we
have
law
and
lawyers.
they
try
to
minimize
it.
this
doesn't
seem
fruitful
to
me.
