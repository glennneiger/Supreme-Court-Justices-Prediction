ms.
lisa

thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
think
this
case
is
best
resolved
under
the
opposition
clause,
and
that
clause
does
not
require
employees
to
utter
magic
words
of
opposition
or
to
initiate
the
interview
in
which
they
express
opposition
to
unlawful
conduct.
rather,
the
clause
is
satisfied
when
a
reasonable
person
would
understand
that
the
employee
has
objected
to
sexual
harassment
in
the
workplace.
and
when
an
employee
discloses
or
reports
that
she
has
been
subject
to
unlawful
sexual
harassment,
a
reasonable
person
could
certainly
infer
that
the
employee
opposes
a
practice
made
unlawful
by
the
statute.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
she
has
got
timing
requirements.
so
if
she
hasn't
complained
to
the
eeoc
within
the
relevant
time,
she
wouldn't
have
a
cause
of
action
for
discrimination.
but
once
she
has
retaliated
--
an
adverse
action
is
taken
against
her
because
of
what
she
has
reported,
then
she
has
timing
requirements
on
when
she
has
to
sue
for
the
retaliation,
and
she
did
that
here.
and
this
is
a
case
where
the
sixth
circuit
tossed
the
case
out
on
summary
judgment,
and
it
erred
in
doing
so
because
the
facts
alleged
in
this
case
were
more
than
ample
to
survive
summary
judgment
on
the
question
of
whether
she
opposed
what
the
director
of
employee
relations
did
to
her.
she
alleged
that
in
the
context
of
a
sexual
harassment
investigation
in
which
she
was
asked
to
disclose
inappropriate
behavior
by
the
director,
she
reported
repeated
instances
of
offensive,
objectionable,
and
unwelcome
conduct
by
him.
for
instance,
she
said
that
she
had
her
head
pulled
into
his
lap
and
that
in
response
she
threw
him
out
of
the
office,
thereby
indicating
that
she
did
not
like
this
conduct.
the
jury
could
easily
infer
from
those
facts
that
she
opposed
the
director's
conduct.
now,
that
timing
would--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--if
you
--
yes,
if
a
reasonable
person
could
infer
that.
i
think
that
we
are
similar.
but
if
you
just
are
a
reporter
of
unlawful
conduct,
that's
enough.
but
this
case
is
easier,
much
easier.
she
was
a
victim.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
understand
that.
and
if
--
you
can
either
decide
the
broader
question
or
the
question
of
the
petitioner
here,
which
she
reported
that
she
was
subject,
and
it
makes
it
all
the
more
evident,
and
certainly
a
jury
could
have
found
that
she
opposed
the
conduct.
but
we
do
think
that
at
least
a
reasonable
inference
could
be
drawn
--
when
you
report
facts
that
would
constitute
unlawful
activity,
the
reasonable
inference
is
that
you
have
objected.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
if
you
just
have
a--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
think
this
is
where
we
have
not
embraced
the
position
of
the
eeoc,
that
we
don't
think
that
expresses
opposition
if
all
you
do
is
say,
"here's
what
a
person's
job
duties
were
and
he
was
in
town
on
that
day.
"
or
"i
had
lunch
with
him
on
that
day.
"
and
that
would
verify
--
it
may
verify
a
victim's
statement
or
corroborate
it
and
thereby
be
the
essential
evidence
in
the
case,
but
it
wouldn't
come
within
the
statutory
language
of
opposing.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
if
a
reasonable
--
well,
if
a
reasonable
person
knew
from
all
the
circumstances,
then
maybe.
if
this
--
unfortunately,
if
you
don't
like
jury
trials,
this
is
a
jury
question
whether
you
oppose
the
practice
or
not,
and
it
would
have
to
go
to
a
jury
based
on
the
totality
of
the
evidence.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
when
you
said
"least
resistance",
it
certainly
is
the
most
sweeping
and
broad
coverage.
in
that
sense,
you
cover
all
witnesses
and
participants
in
the
process,
and
we
think
congress
intended
to
do
so
here.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
participation
clause
is
much
broader
coverage.
it
could
--
it
would
cover
anyone
who
participates
in
the
investigation,
whether
or
not
they
oppose
the
practice.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
opposition.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
if
this
were
before
the
eeoc,
everybody
who
testifies
in
that
proceeding
or
participates
in
the
investigation
would
be
covered.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
oppose
a
practice.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
so
in
that
sense,
it's
broader.
the
reason
why
this
case
is
easier
for
you,
under
the
opposition
clause,
is
it's
a
narrow
holding
and
it
doesn't
get
you
into
the
question
of
whether
just
an
employer
investigation
is
an
investigation--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
exactly
right,
but
at
a
minimum
when
you
have
a
victim
of
sexual
harassment
who
reports
it
to
her
employer
in
the
context
of
an
investigation
where
she's
asked
was
there
anything
inappropriate
and
she
recounts
here,
it's
so
clearly
opposition.
it
so
clearly
should
not
have
been
thrown
out
on
summary
judgment.
and
it
so
clearly
can
force--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--absolutely.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
but
that--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
correct.
we
don't
and
neither
does
the
eeoc
interpret
their
compliance
manual
as--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes,
it
is
true
that
it's
in
a
brief,
it's
on
their
website,
it's
on
home
page,
on
their
website.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it's
not
in
their
compliance
manual;
it's
in
our
amicus
brief,
but
it
is
the
eeoc's
position.
and,
again,
that's
why
i
think
it's
an
easier
case
for
you
under
the
opposition
clause.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no,
but
you
have
to
remember
there
are
two
separate
clauses.
the
statute
under
the
opposition
clause
just
says
"oppose
a
practice
made
unlawful".
if
you
didn't
oppose
a
practice,
you're
not
covered
under
that.
you
would
be
covered
under
--
in
the
proceeding,
why
there
is
such
broad
coverage.
once
you're
under
the
participation
clause,
no
matter
what
the
substance
of
your
testimony
is,
it's
covered.
it
protects
the
process
itself,
regardless
of
whether
it
was
--
it
was
determined
true.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
think--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
think
that
position
is
consistent
with
the
eeoc,
and
i
don't
think
we
would
oppose
that
position
in
the
sense
that
it
would
give
the
greatest
and
broadest
protection.
and
what
is
so
upsetting
about
this
case
is
the
gaping
hole
in
statutory
coverage
that
the
sixth
circuit
left.
it
is
an
inexplicable
gap
that
a
complaining
witness
in
an
employer
investigation
would
be
unprotected
from
retaliation.
the
statute
simply
can't
function,
as
intended
by
congress,
as
intended
by
this
court,
if
there
are
all
these
incentives
for
employees
to
investigate
unlawful
activity,
witnesses
come
forward
and
report
that
they,
in
fact,
have
been
subjected
to
sexual
harassment,
and
employers
are
free
to
retaliate.
they--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--it
is.
it
is,
but
it's
all
the
more
reason
that
she
has
to
be
covered
under
one
of
them
if
not
both
of
them.
witnesses
simply
are
going
to
be
afraid
to
fully
cooperate
if
they're
not
given
protection.
and
if
there
are
no
questions,
we'd
ask
that
the
sixth
circuit
be--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
i
mean,
we
think
that
is
border-line
absurd,
although
all
courts
that
have
reached
the
issue
have
held
that.
and
it
just
--
it
makes
no
sense,
and
it
--
i'm
not
even--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--have
held
that
--
that
the
internal
investigation
is
covered
as
long
as
somebody
has
filed
a
charge.
it's
not
clear
who
or
that
it
has
to
be
related
to
the
subject
matter.
and
that
would
mean
if
the
investigation
is
conducted
on
the
day
a
charge
is
filed
at
noon,
all
the
witnesses
who
came
in,
in
the
morning,
are
unprotected;
yet
all
the
witnesses
who
came
in,
in
the
afternoon,
would
be
protected.
yet
nobody
even
knows
that
a
charge
has
been
filed.
and
that's
just
not
something
that
congress
possibly
could
have
intended
and
wanted
to
leave
the
morning
witnesses
unprotected
from
retaliation.
so
i
don't
think
the
current
state
of
the
law
under
the
participation
clause
is
supported
by
the
text,
and
it's
certainly
not
supported
by
any
policy
under
title
vii.
no
questions?
