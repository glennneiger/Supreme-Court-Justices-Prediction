mr.
schnapper--
justice
ruth

--but
why
are
we
--
why
are
we
spending
so
much
time
on
hypotheticals
that
are
so
far
from
this
case?
this
was
a
person
who
appeared
at
an
internal
proceeding,
she
gave
testimony,
very
specific
testimony.
she
wasn't
saying:
i'm
against
harassment.
she
said:
this
boss
harassed
me.
it
is
about
as
specific
as
you
get.
so
we're
dealing
with
a
particular
case
of
somebody
who
was
a
witness
in
an
internal
investigation.
why
do
we
have
to
reach
the
outer
boundaries
of
this
claim
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
----
[laughter]
but
i
thought
that
the
--
real
case
--
the
real
case
that
we're
dealing
with
is
somebody
who
appeared
in
an
internal
investigation,
and
i
thought
that
what
was
the
debate
between
the
two
sides;
anyone
who
made
a
charge,
testified,
assisted,
or
participated
in
any
manner
in
the
investigation,
i
thought
that
the
other
side's
position
was,
well,
this
is
not
an
"investigation"
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
that
what
goes
on
internally
doesn't
qualify.
vii
requires
first
that
there
be
a
title
vii
charge.
i
thought
that
that's
what
the
controversy
we're
talking
about
today
is
about:
is
this
a
qualifying
investigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
--
the
other
side
says
this
is
not
an
investigation.
there
was
no
charge
filed.
she's
filed
no
charge.
so
this
is
not
a
qualifying
investigation.
what
is
the
government's
position
on
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
investigation
is
not
of
her.
she's
testifying
as
a
witness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
is
an
act
that's
meant
to
protect
people
against
discrimination
in
the
workplace,
including
harassment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
a
woman
who
testified
truthfully
--
we
have
to
assume
that
because
this
was
tossed
out
at
the
very
threshold,
so
we
have
to
assume
that
everything
she
alleged
in
her
complaint
is
true,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
no
--
no
dis
--
then
there
has
to
be
no
genuine
dispute
as
to
any
material
fact.
that
means
we
must
take
her
allegations
of
fact
as
true
at
this
point.
but
in
any
case
this
is
a
statute
that's
meant
to
govern
the
workplace
with
all
of
its
realities.
one
of
them
was
when
they
asked,
well,
why
didn't
you
make
a
complaint,
use
whatever
internal
remedies
are
there
are?
she
said,
because
the
person
in
this
outfit
who
is
charged
with
receiving
complaints
is
the
harasser.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
have
to
--
everything
--
for
you
to
prevail,
since
there
has
been
no
trial
on
the
facts,
we
have
to
take
the
facts
as
she
alleges
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
about
taking
our
decisions
in
the
faragher
and
ellerth
case
which
in
a
sense
made
the
employer's
internal
investigation
part
of
the
eeo
process
because
it
says
to
the
employer,
if
you
don't
have
that
find
of
effective
internal
complaint
and
investigation
procedure,
then
you're
going
to
be
stuck
on
respondeat
superior
liability.
if
you
do,
then
you
will
be
shielded.
so
this
court's
decision
in
those
two
cases
seemed
to
me
to
say
to
every
employer,
as
part
of
your
eeo
compliance
you
had
better
have
this
internal
complaint
procedure
and
investigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
the
other
arguments
on
summary
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
say
it's
not
that
the
employer
is
stuck
because
there's
a
potential
retaliation
claim,
if
the
employer
is
certain
of
its
grounds,
that
this
discharge
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
testimony,
then
go
ahead
and
discharge
her.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
other
side,
that
attorney,
there's
a
large
disincentive.
he
hasn't
got
a
good
case.
he's
not
going
to
be
paid
any
retainer
as
you
might
be.
and
he's
not
going
to
get
any
counsel
fees.
why
should
such
--
why
should
it
--
counsel
be
available
to
a
person
who
obviously
was
discharged
for
having
her
hand
in
the
till
and
not
because
she
was
harassed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
i
meant
that
as
a
hypothetical.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
reason
that
she
was
--
what
was
the
employer's
reason
for
discharging
her?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
said
if
you
have
a
really
strong
case
of
having
discharged
this
person
for
cause
that
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
harassment,
you
are
going
to
win
the
lawsuit
and
it
would
be
hard
for
the
plaintiff
to
get
a
decent
lawyer
to
represent
her
side
of
the
case
because
she's
going
to
lose.
