what
if
the
employee
just
made
--
reports
factual
information:
supervisor
did
such
and
such;
doesn't
express
opposition
to
it.
or
what
if
the
employee
goes
further
and
says:
supervisor
did
such
and
such,
but
i
know
he
was
just
kidding;
or
i
hope
you
don't
take
any
action
against
that
person.
would
that
be
opposition?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
ask
this.
suppose
the
employer
conducts
an
investigation
because
it
believes
that
the
supervisor
has
engaged
in
improper
activity.
so
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
substantiate
grounds
for
dismissal
or
some
other
sanction.
and
then
an
employee
provides
information
that's
exculpatory.
can
--
is
that
protected?
is
that
--
is
that
information
protected.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it
strange
when
there
are
many
situations
in
which
testimony
or
the
reporting
of
information
is
protected,
but
when
it's
done,
isn't
it
usually
done
both
ways,
as
it
is
under
the
participation
clause?
so
that
the
testimony
is
--
cannot
be
the
subject
of
retaliation
or
the
reporting
of
information
cannot
be
the
subject
of
retaliation,
but
not
it's
protected
only
if
it
goes
in
one
direction?
isn't
that
a
very
odd
approach
to
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
wouldn't
that
be
very
strange?
suppose
that
this
--
the
factual
situation
actually
is
very
severe
and
is
enough
to
--
to
establish
liability
on
the
employer's
part,
but
this
particular
reporting
employee
doesn't
think
so.
so
then
the
employer
might
well
be
very
annoyed
that
this
information
which
can
be
the
--
the
basis
for
liability
has
been
brought
out
against
the
employer,
and
the
employer
might
want
to
retaliate.
why
would
that
be
unprotected
just
because
this
employee
adds
his
or
her
opinion
that
it
isn't
serious?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
test
for
determining
whether
an
investigation
has
been
done,
and
the
person
has
testified?
what
degree
of
formality,
if
anything,
is
necessary?
if
--
if
somebody
in
--
in
the
company
simply
goes
to
the
office
of
an
employee
or
the
workplace
of
an
employee
or
encounters
the
employee
in
the
hallway
or
someplace
and
asks
a
question,
is
that
enough?
does
it
have
to
be--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--a
sort
of
a
formal
proceeding
in
--
in
some
sense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
you
think
of
any
other
situation
in
which
the
law
says
that
a
person
who
testifies
or
provides
information
is
protected
against
retaliation
only
if
that
person
gives
testimony
of
a
particular
type
or
gives
a
statement
of
a
particular
type?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
--
what
i'm
asking
is,
is
the
reason
to
doubt
whether
congress
intended
in
the
opposition
clause
to
provide
protection
only
for
people
who
testify
or
provide
information
that
goes
in
a
particular
direction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
purpose
is
to
--
is
to
elicit
information
and
protect
the
people
who
come
forward
with
the
information,
then
why
don't
you
provide
the
protection
irrespective
of
what
the
person
says?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
wouldn't
this
fall
within
the
participation
clause?
there
was
an
investigation,
and
--
and
you
described
the
people
who
provided
information
as
"witnesses".
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
why
doesn't
it
fall
under
the
participation
clause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
never,
even
after
--
even
after
a
charge
has
been
filed
with
the
eeoc?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what's
your
argument?
