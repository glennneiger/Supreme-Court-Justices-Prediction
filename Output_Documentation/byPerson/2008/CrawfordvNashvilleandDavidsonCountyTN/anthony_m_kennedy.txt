justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
going
to
say
in
part
it
seems
to
me
that
in
isolation
it
seems
harmless,
almost
trivial,
but
the
whole
point
is
that
the
employer
doesn't
think
it
is
trivial.
the
employer
uses
it,
by
hypothesis,
as
a
basis
to
retaliate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
the
participation
clause
is
the
line
of
least
resistance.
i
understand
we
have
to
say
what
a
hearing
is
and
so
forth.
are
you
asking
us
to
resolve
on
the
opposition
clause
because
that
will
give
more
guidance
to
the
system
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
think
that's
a
very
strong
argument
for
the
participation
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
have
to
answer
that.
we'll
be
glad
to
see
you
again.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
only
question
--
the
participation
is
not
in
doubt.
the
only
question
is
whether
it's
an
investigation
under
this
subtitle.
