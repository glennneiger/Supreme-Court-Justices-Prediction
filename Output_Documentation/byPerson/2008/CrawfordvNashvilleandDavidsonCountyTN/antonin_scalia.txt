justice
antonin
scalia
so
a
co-worker
of
your
client
says:
you
know,
the
boss
really
was
guilty
of
sexual
harassment
and
the
co-worker
says:
gee,
that's
terrible.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
enough?
that's
opposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about,
violating
the
law
is
terrible?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
but
if
she
said
that
in
response
to
the
remark
by
the
co-worker
that
she
had
been
subjected
to
sexual
harassment
and
then
the
remark
was
"violating
the
law
is
terrible",
that's
opposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
doesn't
solve
the
problem
of
having
too
broad
an
entry
into
this
thing.
you
get
to
the
jury
by
just
showing
that
she
said
"oh,
if
he
did
that,
it's
terrible.
"
and
then
it's
up
to
the
jury
all
of
a
sudden
whether
that
is
the
reason
that
the
employer
fired
this
person
or
not.
i
mean,
that
just
leaves
--
lays
the
employer
open
to
a
lot
of
jury
determinations
that
he
shouldn't
be
subject
to,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
does
not
have
to
have
been
sexual
harassment
in
the
employment
unit.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
is
a
law
directed
against
expressive
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
those
laws
good?
i
thought
we
had
a
first
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
be
fine
with
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
--
what
if
i
am
indeed
very
much
in
favor
of
sexual
harassment?
i
am
a
world
class
sexual
harasser,
but
i'm
also
not
a
liar,
and
i'm
--
i
am
subpoenaed
or
called
up
by
the
employer
in
connection
with
this
internal
investigation
and
asked
whether
so-and-so
harassed
a
particular
worker.
and
i'd
say,
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did,
and
a
good
thing
too.
is
that
expressing
opposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
covered
by
the
participation
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
since
this
is
a
case
where
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would?
why?
it
doesn't
seem
so
to
me.
i
mean,
it
either
was
or
wasn't.
you're
making
the
argument,
essentially,
that
"oppose"
has
two
quite
different
meanings.
you
can
ask
somebody,
you
know,
do
you
oppose
the
war
in
iraq?
and
all
you're
asking
is
what
is
your
opinion
of
the
war
in
iraq.
do
you
think
it
is
good
or
bad?
but
"oppose"
is
also
used
in
a
quite
different
sense.
he
--
you
say
somebody
opposed
the
war
in
iraq,
you
mean
he
went
out
and
--
and
paraded
against
it
and
so
forth.
and
your
assertion
is
that
in
this
legislation,
it
has
the
latter
meaning.
it
just
doesn't
ask
for
your
opinion
about
whether
sexual
harassment
is
good
or
bad.
it
asks
whether
you
were
actively
--
actively
opposing
it.
now,
once
you
adopt
that
position,
i
don't
see
how
the
fact
that
you
--
that
something
that
was
not
active
opposition
can
be
converted
into
active
opposition
by
something
that
occurred
later.
i
mean,
if
you
want
to
abandon
your
other
argument,
that's
fine
with
me,
but
----
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
uncomfortable?
say
it
doesn't.
i
mean,
i
--
i
don't
care
if
you're
uncomfortable
with
it.
does
it
or
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
i
don't
understand
your
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
just
a
specific
--
again,
if
i
don't
understand
your
case,
it
isn't
just
a
matter
of
the
specific
practice.
your
point
is
it
is
not
asking
your
opinion.
it
is
asking
whether
you
are
actively
trying
to
eliminate
it.
i
think
even
if
--
if
you
were
asked
your
opinion,
you
know,
do
you
--
do
you
oppose
what,
you
know,
what
this
supervisor
did?
and
--
and
you
said
yes,
i
don't
favor
it,
i
think
it's
bad,
i
think
it's
a
bad
idea,
i
--
as
i
understand
your
case,
that's
not
opposition.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
see
how
that
is
changed
at
all
when
you
put
it
in
the
context
of
a
specific
act
of
harassment
as
opposed
to
putting
it
in
the
context
of
harassment
in
general.
you
--
you
--
if
you're
hiding
behind
the
--
the
defenses
you've
built
up,
it
seems
to
me
those
defenses
require
something
more
than
an
expression
of
your
opinion
of
whether
it's
good
or
bad.
your
opinion
is
whether
it's
good
or
bad
is
not
opposition.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
your
point
would
be
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
reason
was
that
she
didn't
report
it.
in
order
to
recover
here
she
has
to
have
taken
a
public
stand;
and
whatever
the
reason
why
she
didn't,
the
fact
is
that
she
didn't.
why
do
you
get
into,
you
know,
the
reason
that
she
didn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
i
suppose
that
you
--
you
would
require
the
--
the
opposition
to
be
somehow
a
public
--
a
public
expression
of
opposition.
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
one
political
candidate
says
that
the
other
one
opposed
the
war
in
iraq,
do
you
think
the
other
candidate
could
say,
that's
a
lie?
i'm
sorry,
that
the
charge
would
be
held
to
be
correct
if,
in
fact,
the
other
candidate
had
never
said
anything
about
the
war
in
iraq,
although
deep
in
his
heart
he
thought
it
was
probably
a
bad
idea.
would
you
say
that
he
opposed
the
war
in
iraq?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
implication
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
implication
is
that
he
came
out
with
some
public
position
opposing
it,
and
that's
your
position
as
to
the
meaning
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
couldn't
he
--
i'm
sorry,
chief
justice.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
were
going
to
answer
justice
souter
with
the
assertion
that
if
indeed
the
court
wants
employers
to
conduct
these
investigations,
it
does
not
want
to
reduce
the
incentive
to
do
so.
and
the
rule
that
is
urged
by
the
other
side
means
whenever
the
--
whenever
the
employer
conducts
such
an
investigation,
any
employee
who
is
smart
enough
to
come
in
and
testify
against
--
against
sexual
harassment
has
a
guaranteed
job.
it
is
almost
like
--
almost
like
being
a
federal
judge.
[laughter]
you
can't
be
fired
after
that,
or
the
employer
can't
fire
her
without
opening
himself
up
to
a
lawsuit
under
--
under
this
provision.
and
he
might
win
the
lawsuit,
but
it's
going
to
cost
money.
so
why
--
maybe
an
employer
would
rather
say,
you
know,
i'd
rather
roll
the
dice
and
--
and
not
conduct
an
investigation
and
insulate
all
of
my
hostile
employees
from
--
from
employment
actions.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
get
your
litigation
fees
if
you
win?
if
the
plaintiff
here
loses,
does
she
pay
all
the
attorneys'
fees
that
this
employer
has
incurred
on
this
litigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
even
when
you
win
you
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
true
that
financially
it
is
always
cost-free
for
the
plaintiff
because
she
has
an
attorney
who
is
taking
it
on
a
contingent
basis?
now,
you
could
say
it's
not
cost-free
to
the
lawyer;
but
even
that's
not
always
true
because
if
the
lawyer
has
nothing
else
to
do
he
may
as
well
be
doing
this,
you
know,
whatever
the
odds
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
the
language
"investigation
under
this
title"
is
the
equivalent
of
"investigation
with
respect
to
an
alleged
offense
under
this
title?
"
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
self-evident
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
"investigation
under
this
title"
to
me
means
an
investigation
under
this
title,
which
is
not
an
investigation
by
the
employer.
