chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-1595,
crawford
v.
the
metropolitan
government
of
nashville
and
davidson
county,
tennessee.
mr.
schnapper.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
it's
just,
sexual
harassment
is
terrible?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
there's
no
link,
there's
no
link
to
the
person
that
the
original
--
the
complainant
says
was
engaged
in
that
activity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
mr.
jones,
the
person,
did
that,
that's
terrible.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
actionable
as
opposition
to
the
practices?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but,
you
know,
that's
why
we
ask
hypotheticals
that
aren't
related
to
the
specific
facts,
because
we're
interested
in
how
broadly
the
proposition
you're
asking
for
goes.
i'd
still
like
to
find
out
where
you
draw
the
limit.
what
if
the
person
says:
mr.
jones
would
never
do
anything
like
that,
but
if
he
did
that
would
be
terrible.
now,
is
that
actionable
as
opposition?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
those
are
overlapping
but
not
whatever
it
--
concurring--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--positions.
you
can
oppose
without
participating.
you
can
participate
without
opposing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
blatt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
that
case,
doesn't
the
opposing
employee
herself
have
a
direct
cause
of
action
under
title
vii?
given
what
ms.
crawford
described,
you
know,
"that
happened
to
me,
too.
"
she
could
proceed
under
title
vii
herself.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
you
go
as
far
as
mr.
schnapper
in
determining
what
constitutes
"opposition"?
i
mean,
do
you
agree
with
him
that
a
case
where
somebody
says,
"oh,
mr.
jones
would
never
do
that,
and
if
he
did,
i
think
that
would
be
awful.
"
--is
that
"opposition"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
yes,
i
know,
but
--
i
know,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--facts
that
would
constitute
unlawful
activity.
what
about
facts
that
--
i
mean,
many
of
these
cases,
of
course,
are
he-said/she-said
cases,
and
what
about
the
facts
that
you
are
reporting
confirm
one
side
or
the
other?
they
just
ask
you,
look
--
and,
you
know,
the
person
says,
"well,
every
day
at
three
o'clock
he
came
in
and
do
this.
"
and
you're
outside.
and
he
says,
"no,
i
wasn't
there".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you
opposing
it
if
you
say
--
you
know,
you
are
asked,
"well,
you
know,
you
sit
outside
the
office;
did
he
come
in
there
or
not?
"
and
you
say,
"yes,
he
did".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
you
knew
that
that
was
the
critical
fact
in
resolving
the
complaint?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
opposition
clause
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
depends
how
you
define
the
investigation--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
inquiry,
and
that's
kind
of
a
tough
issue,
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
the
question
i
was
asking
earlier,
you
have
overlapping
but
not
concentric
categories,
so
the
"opposing"
may
be
broader
than
the
"participating
in"
depending
upon
how
we
define
either
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
have
held
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
young.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
more
could
ms.
crawford
do
to
make
it
clear
that
she
opposes
what
was
alleged
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
can
the
fact
that
what
led
to
the
statement
change
the
characterization
of
the
statement?
she
can
initiate
it,
go
in
and
say,
"i
oppose
what's
going
on",
or
if
somebody
just
asks
her,
you
know,
"how
do
you
feel
about
what's
going
on.
"
she
says
she
opposes
it.
it
seems
to
me
in
either
case
you
look
at
the
statement
and
not
what
led
to
the
statement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
why
my
hypothetical
uses
the
word
"oppose".
in
the
first
case,
she
goes
in
of
own
volition
and
says,
"i
oppose";
in
the
second
case,
she
says
"i
oppose"
in
response
to
a
question.
congress
used
the
word
"oppose",
and
my
hypothetical
in
both
cases
used
the
word
"oppose".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
well,
is
it
real
a
magic
word?
she
comes
in
and
says,
"you
won't
believe"
--
you
know
--
"you
think
that's
bad,
wait
till
i
tell
you
what
he
did
to
me.
"
and
goes
on
tells
--
it's
quite
obvious
from
the
context
that
she
opposes
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
please
finish
your
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
faragher
and
ellerth--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
thought
faragher
and
ellerth
were
limited
to
the
hostile
work
environment
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
well,
that's
a
different
question.
is
the
defense
we
recognized
in
ellerth
and
faragher
in
the
hostile
work
environment
case
or
in
the
specific
action
case
as
well?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
not
going
to
win
--
you're
not
going
to
win
this
case;
you're
going
to
settle
if
you
lose
up
here,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
point
is
simply
that
the
incentive
system
is
skewed
because
if
you
lose
you
pay
not
only
your
attorneys'
fees
but
the
complainants'.
if
you
win,
you
have
to
incur
yours.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
saying
it
shouldn't
be.
but
in
terms
of
the
pressures
towards
settlement,
it
is
a
very
strong
incentive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
schnapper,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
ms.
blatt
said
the
government
would
prefer
a
decision
under
the
opposition
ground
as
opposed
to
the
participation.
do
you
have
a
preference?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
three
opinions
today.
