mr.
francis
h.
young
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
title
vii
was
the
result
of
a
congressional
compromise
which
struck
a
balance
between
protecting
the
interests
of
employees
and
employers.
in
relation
to
the
anti-retaliation
provisions
of
section
704,
that
balance
was
struck
to
protect
the
rights
of
employees
to
report
allegedly
discriminatory
activity,
as
well
as
employers'
rights
to
manage
their
workplaces.
the
participation
clause
covers
activity
or
conduct
in
the
course
of
an
investigation,
proceeding,
or
hearing
under
title
vii.
the
opposition
clause
--
the
actual
words
of
the
opposition
clause
protect
an
employee
who
has
opposed
a
particular
unlawful
practice.
mr.
francis
h.
young
she
could
have
--
she
could
have
initiated
making
contact
with
the
government
official
to
register
a
complaint
or
an
objection.
instead,
she
made
a
disclosure
or
she
cooperated
in
the
investigation,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
young
congress
chose
to
use
the
word
"oppose",
your
honor.
that's
why
the
short--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--if
she's
not
taking
the
initiative,
then
she
has
to
report
it
and
request
that
something
be
done
about
it.
does
the
word
--
if
she
uses
the
word
"oppose",
as
in
your
hypothetical,
that
would
not
be
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
that
would
probably
nudge
it
to
the
line
of
opposition
conduct
because
she's
using
the
word
"oppose".
mr.
francis
h.
young
well,
that's
why
we
advocate
a
reasonableness
standard,
your
honor,
in
the
ears
of
the
person
receiving
the
information,
but
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
standard
was
not
met.
the
true
opposition
activity
--
it's
called
the
opposition
clause,
not
the
disclosure
clause,
not
the
cooperation
clause.
there's
an
element
--
and
all
the
parties
have
provided
the
court
with
a
dictionary
--
the
various
dictionary
definitions
of
the
word
"oppose",
all
of
which
contain
the
common
theme
of
resistance,
coming
up
against
something,
communicating
resistance.
when
the
--
when
what
mrs.
crawford
said
to
the
human
resources
investigator
in
response
to
questioning
is
actually
examined,
it
is
making
a
disclosure.
there's
no
request
that
anything
be
done
about
it.
the
time
lag
between
the
end
of
the
alleged
harassment
and
the
actual
reporting
is
over
two
months.
mrs.
crawford
had
multiple
opportunities
to
report
to
her
supervisor,
her
supervisor's
supervisor,
the
director
of
employee--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--that
would
--
the
fact
that
your
honor
chose
the
term
"complaint"
would
be
a
different
situation
from
what
we
had
here.
a
subsequent--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--that
complaint
would
undoubtedly
be
opposition.
would
it
reach
back--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--would
it
retroactively
imbue
the
initial
disclosure
with
an
opposition
quality?
yes.
mr.
francis
h.
young
your
honor,
i'm
uncomfortable
with
the
concept
that
subsequent
--
a
subsequent
complaint
can
imbue
a
prior
statement
with
that--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--perhaps
yes.
but
if
it
does--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
see
that
distinction
as
being
relevant.
because
if
--
if
a
subsequent
complaint
is
made
a
month,
two
months
after
the
initial
disclosing
conduct,
then
we're
--
then
we're
traveling
on
that
subsequent
complaint.
and
the
fact
that
a
disclosure
was
made
a
month
or
two
prior
doesn't
become
a
relevant
watershed
date
in
terms
of
when
the
protections
of
the
statute
arise.
the
--
the
--
the
concept
is
something
more
than
disclosure,
something
more
than
mere
cooperation.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
he
or
she
has
opposed
a
specific
practice,
not
just
opposition
to
the
war
in
iraq
in
general;
not
just
opposition
to
sexual
harassment
in
general;
but
that
a
specific--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--your
honor--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
used
the
term
"practice"
inartfully.
our
argument
is
there
is
a
specific
act
that
the
employee
considers
to
be
unlawful,
and
that's
what
the
employee
is
opposing.
so
that
is
what
needs
to
be
communicated
to
a
reasonable
person
within
the
government
or
within--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--it's
specific
to
the
act,
your
honor,
but
i
--
i
would
argue
that
does
not
cross
the
line
into
"and
i
oppose
it".
mr.
francis
h.
young
well,
i
think
the
word
"oppose"
can
be
used
in
a
specific
sense
in
common
everyday
speech
and
can
be
used
in
a
general
sense,
your
honor.
and
i
think--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--the
--
your
honor's
hypothetical
of
saying
something
is
terrible
would
--
would
--
would
not
be
commonly
understood
to
communicate
opposition
to--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--her
statement
to
him
to
get
out
of
my
office
would--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--yes,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
francis
h.
young
well,
the
--
because
the
--
in
the
context
of
anti-retaliation
provisions,
making
a
statement
to
an
alleged
harasser
to
stop
the
harassment
or
get
out
of
my
office
does
not
rise
to
opposition
conduct,
because
the
--
the
--
the
essence
of
the
opposition
clause
is
somehow
putting
the
employer
on
notice.
if
every
employee
who
was
a
victim
of
sexual
harassment
and
says
stop,
if
that
--
if
that
constitutes
opposition
conduct
under
the
retaliation
clause,
suddenly
that
employee
has
two
causes
of
action,
one
for
sexual
harassment
and
one
for
retaliation.
mr.
francis
h.
young
yes,
it
was
in
english.
yes,
it
makes
sense,
your
honor,
but
i
would
beg
to
differ,
respectfully.
the
best
way
to
oppose
sexual
harassment
is
to
go
and
make
a
complaint
about
it.
mr.
francis
h.
young
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
--
there
are
enough
contradictory
statements
in
the
compliance
manual
itself
that
any
deference
that
this
court
is
inclined
to
give
to
the
eeoc's
compliance
manual
should
be
tempered
by
the
fact
that
even
the
eeoc
recognizes
the
importance
of
employees
taking
initiative
to
report
harassment
and
not--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--and
not
sitting
back
and
waiting
for
the
investigation
to
come
to
them.
mr.
francis
h.
young
she's
offering
a
statement
in
an
interview,
your
honor,
as
a
witness,
yes.
mr.
francis
h.
young
yes.
mr.
francis
h.
young
it
is
not
up
--
it
is
not
before
this
court
on
a
rule
12
standard
of
assuming
all
the
allegations
are
true,
your
honor;
but
it
comes
to
the
court
on
summary
judgment.
mr.
francis
h.
young
that
isn't
--
that
was
her
contention.
that's
not
necessarily
true.
mr.
francis
h.
young
there
are
multiple
places
to
report
sexual
harassment,
your
honor.
she
--
she
didn't
even
report
it
to
her
boss.
she
didn't
report
it
to
her
boss's
boss,
and
she
didn't
report
it
to
the
director
of
human
resources.
mr.
francis
h.
young
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
the
reasons
why
she
didn't
make
a
report
are
immaterial.
mr.
francis
h.
young
yes.
mr.
francis
h.
young
your
honor,
even
when--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--even
when--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--yes,
your
honor.
and
even
the
eeoc
in
its
own
compliance
manual
as
set
forth
on
page
38
of
the
red
brief,
the
examples
of
opposition
cited
by
the
eeoc
are
threatening
to
file
a
charge,
complaining,
protesting,
picketing.
these
are
active
verbs.
mr.
francis
h.
young
yes.
mr.
francis
h.
young
an
--
an
employer's
internal
sexual
harassment
investigation
is
not
an
investigation
under
this
title.
mr.
francis
h.
young
well,
the
five
circuits
that
have
squarely
considered
the
issue
have
held
that
that's
the
trigger
that
brings
the
internal
investigation
under
the
rubric
of
the
participation
clause
here,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
young
i'll
--
i'll
take
that.
mr.
francis
h.
young
i
agree.
faragher
and
ellerth
put
the
carrot
on
the
stick
in
front
of
the
employers
and
say,
here's
an
affirmative
defense
that
will
be
available
to
you
in
certain
harassment
cases
if
you
adopt
a
--
an
anti-harassment
policy
which
includes
an
investigation
mechanism.
however,
such
a
policy
and
such
a
mechanism
is
not
made
mandatory
by
faragher
and
ellerth.
the
argument
of--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--the
fact
that
faragher
and
ellerth
create
an
incentive
to
employers
to
develop
these
policies
with
investigate
--
which
include
investigations,
does
not
elevate
such
investigations
to
fall
under
the
statutory
requirement
of
being--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--because
at
some
point,
your
honor,
the
construction
departs
so
far
from
what
can
reasonably
be
supported
by
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
that
it--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--it
--
it
is
an
"investigation".
our
contention
is
it
does
not
fall
under
the
category
of
an
"investigation"
under
this
title
even
despite
faragher
and
ellerth.
mr.
francis
h.
young
of
supervisory
harassment,
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
young
my
understanding
of
faragher
and
ellerth
is
that
it
--
it
applies
in
the
hostile
work
environment
case
involving
harassment
by
a
supervisor.
mr.
francis
h.
young
that
would
be
the
--
that
would
be
the
employer's
interest.
the
disincentive
that
the
employers
would
have
to
comply
with
these
--
with
this
court's
directives
or
strong
suggestions
in
faragher
and
ellerth
is
employers
would
stop
conducting
these
investigations
if
everyone
they
interviewed
was
going
to
be
a
potential
retaliation
claim.
mr.
francis
h.
young
their
--
they
would
lose
the
protections
of
faragher
and
ellerth.
we
would
be
back
to
respondeat
superior
liability.
it
sounds
illogical,
but
i
--
i
submit
to
the
court
that
if
--
that
if
it
is
going
to
be
a
hobson's
choice
and
it
--
it
would
be
a
situation
in
which
employers
would
have
an
incentive
to
choose
not
to
--
would
choose
to
abandon
their
policies
and
take
their
chances.
if
they
have
to
interview
20
people
in
a
--
in
a
retaliation
--
in
a
sexual
harassment
case,
there's
20
potential
plaintiffs
because
they
all
participated.
it
doesn't
even
matter
if
the
employer
knows
what
the
employees
said.
if
--
if
some
type
of
discipline
or
adverse
action
is
imposed
by
the
employer
on
any
of
those
employees,
there
is
an
instant
retaliation
claim.
mr.
francis
h.
young
i
have
two
arguments
left
in
my
quiver
on
summary
judgment,
your
honor,
that
the
trial
court
didn't
even
consider.
so
if
this
case
goes
back
down,
that's
what
i'm
going
to
ask
the
trial
court
to
consider.
mr.
francis
h.
young
the
lack
of
causation,
the
lack
of
knowledge
between
whatever
ms.
crawford
told
the
investigator
in
this
confidential
interview
as
to
which
confidentiality
was
promised
and
delivered,
the
lack
of
any
knowledge
--
the
lack
of
any
evidence
that
the
decision-makers
regarding
ms.
crawford
and
her
job,
that
they
knew
what
she
said
in
this
interview.
the
lack
of
causation
is
my
first
ground
and
the
lack
of
pretext
is
my
second
ground
that
has
yet
to
be
considered.
because
of
the
abundant
evidence
of
misconduct
which
was
discovered
regarding
how
ms.
crawford
was
not
running
her
office.
mr.
francis
h.
young
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
young
it
is
very
difficult
for
a
victorious
defendant
to
recover
attorneys'
fees
under
section
1988,
your
honor.
the
threshold
is
very
high.
i've
never
recovered
the
fees
in
my
14
years
working
for
this
office
in
a
section
1983
case.
mr.
francis
h.
young
yes.
in
that
sense,
yes,
your
honor.
or
a
title
vii
case.
mr.
francis
h.
young
first
of
all,
there
is
no
allegation
that
ms.
crawford
embezzled
or
took
money.
there
is
no
allegation,
and
she
was
not
disciplined.
she
was
not
discharged
based
on
any
allegation
she
was
stealing
money.
that's
simply
not
a
factor.
mr.
francis
h.
young
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
francis
h.
young
multiple
--
she
was
the
payroll
coordinator
and
her
office
--
all
these
checks
were
sitting
in
her
office
and
they
were
not
being
processed.
some
of
them
were
six,
eight,
ten
months
old.
her
office
was
in
complete
disarray.
and
this
came
to
light
as
a
result
of
this
sexual
harassment
investigation
when
her
subordinates
were
interviewed
and
they
provided
testimony
regarding
how
she
was
running
her
office,
and
that
eventually
got
to
the
finance
department
of
the
government,
which
hired
an
outside
auditor
which
went
in
and
generated
all
this
evidence
at
great
expense
to
the
metropolitan
government
to
hire
this
outside
auditor.
that's
where
the
evidence
was
developed
to
terminate
ms.
crawford
six
months
after
the
statement
to
the
investigators.
so
that's
--
those
were
the
facts
on
how
it
happened.
i
forgot
your
honor's
original
question,
or
maybe
i
answered
it.
i
don't
know.
mr.
francis
h.
young
in
theory,
yes;
but
the
burdens
of
litigation,
which
is
part
of
the
congressional
compromise
--
back
in
1964
in
order
to
gain
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act,
employer's
interests
were
deemed
to
be
of
equal
magnitude
as
employees'.
mr.
francis
h.
young
if
i
lose
up
here,
first
i've
got
two
more
shots
at
summary
judgment,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
h.
young
i
hope
i'm
not--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--in
civil
rights
cases
the
incentives,
that
incentive
fee,
that
incentive
system,
is
skewed
against
the
defendants
because
of
the
public
policy
reason
favoring--
mr.
francis
h.
young
--yes.
mr.
francis
h.
young
well,
your
honor,
many
of
these
types
of
cases
are
taken
on
a
contingent
fee
basis
except
for
hard
costs.
mr.
francis
h.
young
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
and
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions,
thank
you.
