justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
believe,
as
i
understood
you
to
suggest
a
moment
ago,
that
you
could
prove
causation
if
the
statement
"it
is
terrible"
or
"sexual
harassment
is
terrible"
had
been
uttered
in
effect
in
the
abstract
without
reference
to
particular
behavior
or
a
charge
of
particular
behavior
on
the
part
of
a
co-worker
or
an
employer?
in
other
words,
if
a
says
"sexual
harassment
is
terrible"
and
elsewhere
in
the
company
sexual
harassment
is
going
on
and
a
is
then
fired,
would
it
be
your
view
that
a
would
at
least
state
a
claim
if
a
said,
i
had
expressed
disapproval
of
sexual
harassment,
it
turns
out
there
was
sexual
harassment
being
gone
--
taking
place
elsewhere;
and
i
was
fired
for
that
reason.
would
that
at
least
state
a
claim
that
would
get
a
harassment
case
into
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
i'm
getting
at,
doesn't
the
statement
"it's
terrible"
or
whatever
the
opposition
may
be
have
to
be
made
in
relation
to
some
specific
activity?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what
is
the
limit?
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
a
cause
of
action
in
effect
under
the
statute
that
would
be
virtually
unlimited.
anybody
who
thinks
sexual
harassment
is
bad
and
later
gets
fired
can
claim
retaliation
under
the
statute
if
it
turns
out
just
as
a
matter
of
good
luck
that
somebody
was
being
sexually
harassed
unbeknownst
to
the
speaker.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
if
she
had
made
complaints
after
she
had
answered
the
questions
in
--
and
given
the
information
at
issue
here,
that
would
convert
her
prior
statements
into
opposition?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
asking
you.
you're
in
effect
saying
there
has
got
to
be
some
kind
of
what
you
call
active
opposition;
and
i
took
it
from
what
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
if
she
had
given
the
evidence
in
question
here,
and
then
in
the
period,
subsequent
period
of
two
months,
made
some
sort
of
complaint,
that
that
complaint
would
have
qualified
her
original
evidence
as
opposition.
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
taking
about--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
the
--
if
the
employee
in
response
to
the
inquiry
that's
being
made
says
yes,
i
saw
my
employer
do
"x"
and
it
happened
--
and
i
think
it's
terrible,
that
is
certainly
specific
to
the
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
reason
--
but
the
reason
it
doesn't
cross
the
line
is
you
are,
in
effect,
saying
that
"oppose"
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
has
got
to
be
read
more
narrowly
than
the
--
than
the
notion
of
oppose
as
we
commonly
use
that
word
in
common
speech.
and
i
don't
know
why
--
i
don't
know
what
your
--
what
your
authority
is
for
saying
that
"oppose"
was
not
used
in
its
commonsense
everyday
connotation.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
my
hypothetical,
we're
not
talking
about
a
general
sense.
in
my
hypothetical
we
were
talking
about
a
reference
to
a
very
specific
act.
so
the
generality
problem
doesn't
arise.
and
yet
despite
the
specificity,
you
say,
and
despite
the
fact
that
in
common
speech
a
--
a
specific
statement
like
that
would
be
taken
as
opposition,
you
say
it
shouldn't
be
under
the
statute.
and
the
statute
doesn't
have
any
definition
that
narrows
it.
common
speech
wouldn't
narrow
it
your
way.
why
should
it
be
narrowed
your
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
it's
not
made
mandatory.
any
employer
who
doesn't
go
through
it
is
crazy.
and
i
don't
see
how
this
court,
having
imposed
in
practical
terms
the
requirement
that
justice
ginsburg
just
described,
can
then
say,
oh,
but
we're
going
to
construe
this
indefinite
term
of
"investigation"
to
exclude
this
kind
of
employer
activity
which
our
construction
of
the
statute
has
virtually
mandated.
so
that
if
in
fact
the
employer's
investigation
succeeds
in
ending
the
problem
and
there
is
no
eeoc
complaint,
those
who
participated
in
the
investigation
are
absolutely
helpless
against
retaliation.
that
would
be
a
bizarre
way
to
interpret
a
--
a
statute
in
which
we
have
any
--
any
opportunity
to
interpret
"investigation"
to
include
this
kind
of
investigation.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
i'm
--
i'm
giving
you
an
argument
as
to
why
we
should
construe
it
to
elevate
it,
and
--
and
the
argument
is
that
we,
in
effect,
in
what
i
think
were
correct
decisions
--
you
agree,
you
said
a
moment
ago,
were
correct
decisions
--
have
in
practical
terms
mandated
this
kind
of
an
inquiry.
why
then
would
it
be
reasonable
for
us,
if
we
have
any
option
in
construing
the
term
"investigation",
to
construe
it
to
exclude
this
kind
of
investigation
and
exclude
coverage
of
the
people
who
under
our
decisions
are
supposed
to
come
forward
and
--
and
answer
questions?
why
would
that
be
a
reasonable
construction?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
isn't
it
--
why
isn't
an
investigation
by
the
employer
an
"investigation"?
that's
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
instead
they
would
substitute
the
--
the
response
to
an
eeoc
investigation
in
which
they
would
not
have
the
leg
to
stand
on
in
opposing
respondeat
superior.
i
suppose
that
would
be
an
inducement
for
them
to
go
ahead
with
the
investigation;
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
by
the
way,
i
take
it
in
--
in
this
case,
although
this
is
not
the
issue
before
us,
that
if
you
--
if
you
lose
on
the
issues
before
us,
it
is
still
your
position
that
ultimately
you
should
win
this
case,
because
you
have
good
evidence,
you
say
in
your
briefs,
to
indicate
that
the
reason
for
firing
had
nothing
to
do
with
retaliation.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
first
of
this
is
in
06-1595,
crawford
and
metropolitan
government
of
nashville
and
davidson
county.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
vicky
crawford,
was
a
long
time
employee
of
the
respondent
metro
of
the
local
government
of
nashville
and
davidson
county,
tennessee.
in
2002,
metro
began
looking
into
rumors
of
sexual
harassment
by
its
employee
relations
director,
gene
hughes.
as
part
of
the
investigation,
metro
human
resources
employee
asked
crawford
whether
hughes
had
ever
behaved
inappropriately
toward
her.
crawford
replied
with
examples
of
hughes'
act
of
sexual
harassment
directed
at
her
and
described
several
instances
of
grotesque
behavior.
soon
after
crawford
made
her
report,
metro
accused
her
of
embezzlement
and
fired
her.
crawford
sued
metro
under
the
anti-retaliation
provision
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
that
provision
has
two
clauses.
the
first
known
as
the
opposition
clause
bars
employers
from
discriminating
against
employees
because
they
have
opposed
any
practice
prohibited
by
title
vii.
the
second,
the
participation
clause
for
forbids
employers
from
discriminating
against
employees
because
they
have
participated
in
an
investigation
under
title
vii.
the
district
court
in
the
sixth
circuit
ruled
against
crawford.
they
held
that
she
could
not
satisfy
the
opposition
clause
because
she
had
not
instigated
or
initiated
any
complaint
but
instead
had
merely
answered
questions
by
investigators
and
then
already
pending
internal
investigation.
they
also
rejected
her
claim
under
the
participation
clause
which
the
sixth
circuit
applies
to
an
employer's
internal
investigation
only
where
the
investigation
occurs
pursuant
to
a
pending
eeoc
charge
which
was
lacking
here.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
reverse.
crawford's
conduct
falls
within
the
opposition
clause's
scope.
the
opposition
clause
protects
any
employee
who
opposes
forbidden
discriminatory
actions
that
is
an
employee
who
resists
or
shows
hostility
to
unlawful
discrimination.
crawford's
conduct
is
covered
for
her
statement
showed
clear
hostility
to
hughes'
behavior.
the
sixth
circuit
limited
the
definition
of
oppose
to
initiating
a
complaint,
but
the
words
meaning
is
not
so
limited
in
ordinary
speech.
we
often
use
the
word
to
speak
of
someone
who
has
taking
no
action
at
all
who
advance
the
position
beyond
disclosing
it.
for
example,
countless
people
were
known
to
oppose
slavery
before
emancipation
or
are
said
to
oppose
capital
punishment
today
without
writing
public
letters
or
taking
to
the
streets
or
resisting
government.
in
some,
nothing
in
the
opposition
clause
requires
a
bizarre
rule
of
protecting
an
employee
who
reports
discrimination
on
her
own
initiative,
but
not
one
who
reports
the
same
discrimination
in
the
same
words
when
her
employer
asks
a
question.
because
crawford's
conduct
is
covered
by
the
opposition
clause,
we
do
not
reach
your
argument
with
the
sixth
circuit
misread
the
participation
clause
as
well.
we
reverse
and
remand
so
sixth
circuit
can
consider
the
other
defenses
metro
has
raised.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
