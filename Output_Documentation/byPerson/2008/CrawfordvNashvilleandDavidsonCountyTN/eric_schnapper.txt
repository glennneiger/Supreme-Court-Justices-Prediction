mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
vicky
crawford
reported
to
city
officials
that
she
had
been
repeatedly
harassed
by
the
board's
director
of
employee
relations,
her
conduct
was
protected
by
section
704(a)
of
title
vii.
it
is
protected
first
by
the
first
clause
of
section
704(a),
which
is
known
as
the
opposition
clause.
the
opposition
clause
has
three
elements
that
must
be
proven.
only
one
of
them
is
at
issue
here.
but
just
to
set
the
context,
first
a
plaintiff
will
have
to
prove
that
the
employer
acted
with
a
retaliatory
motive.
second,
the
employee's
statement
or
conduct
must
relate
to
action
that
was
unlawful
under
title
vii.
it
might
be
something
that
happened
in
the
past.
it
might
be
a
concern
about
something
that
might
happen
in
the
future.
and
third,
the
conduct
must
be
in
the
nature
of
opposition,
and
that's
the
question
in
dispute
in
this
particular
case.
it
is
our
view
that
the
--
it
is
sufficient
to
establish
that
element
if
a
reasonable
person
would
conclude
from
the
employee's
statement
or
conduct
that
the
employee
disapproved
of
or
objected
to
the
employment
practice
in
question.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
yes,
it
is.
in
fact,
there
are
cases
involving--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--that
would
be
covered.
if
an
employee
wore
a
button--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--the
opposition
doesn't
have
to
be
directed
at
a
particular
event.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
if
there's
no
reference
to
title
vii
that
wouldn't
suffice.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
a
trier
of
fact
could
conclude
she
was
referring
to
what
the
co-worker
had
just
said.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it
is
protected.
if
the
employer
comes
in
and
fires
her
for
having
said
that.
the
case--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--right.
that's
why
the
elements
are
important.
if
the
employer
fires
a
worker
for
that--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--with
all
deference,
your
honor,
the
plaintiff
must
have
sufficient
evidence
to
get
to
the
jury
on
all
three
elements.
retaliation
claims
are
routinely
dismissed
on
the
causation
element.
there's
not
usually
a
dispute
about
whether
the
conduct
was
protected,
and
this
case
in
that
regard
is
unusual.
but
the--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--up--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
at
least
two
questions.
let
me
try
to
answer
them
both.
with
regard
to
what
would
constitute
protected
activity,
it
is
our
view
--
and
i
think
this
is
consistent
with
the
lower
courts
and
the
view
of
the
government
--
that
there
doesn't
have
to
actually
be
a
violation.
if
a
worker
walks
into
the
office
with
a
button
saying
"violations
of
title
vii
are
bad
and
i'm
against
them.
"
she
can
be
--
and
fired
for
that,
that's
illegal
even
though
nothing
was
going
wrong.
mr.
eric
schnapper
you
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
expressing
disagreement
with
conduct
that
violates
the
law
is
what
the
opposition
clause
protects.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
about
a
specific
instance,
although
it
emphatically
is
so
here.
it
doesn't
have
to
reference
the
statute.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
right.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
no.
it
is
a
law
that
protect
expressive
activity
and
those
laws
are
excellent.
it
protects
the
activity.
mr.
eric
schnapper
not
necessarily.
again,
it
depends
on
the
question
that
was
asked
and
the
answer
that
was
given.
if
i
might,
for
example,
in
this
case
the
question
was
did
mr.
hughes
engage
in
inappropriate
activity.
that
was
a
request
--
i
think
a
trier
of
fact
could
understand
that
that
was
a
request
for
a
description
of
something
that
the
witness
objected
to.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it's
our
view
that
that
is
not
protected
by
the
opposition
clause.
it
is
our
view
it
would
be
protected
by
the
participation
clause.
if
i
might
get
back
to
the
question--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--that's
why
we're
advancing
the
view
that
the
participation
clause
here
provides
as
well,
so
that
it's
clear
that
exculpatory
witnesses
are
protected.
it
is
not
unimaginable
that
an
exculpatory
witness
would
anger
someone.
but
going
back
to
the
question
you
asked
earlier,
it's
possible
that
in
response
to
a
question
an
answer
might
be
given
which
a
reasonable
person
would
not
conclude
reflected
disapproval
such
as,
well,
he
told
that
joke,
and
i
thought
it
was
funny.
and,
indeed,
in
the
harris
v.
forklift
case
there
were
witnesses
like
that
who
--
who
confirmed
that
the
owner
of
harris
forklift
had
made
the
jokes
in
question
but
said
they
didn't
mind.
that
that
would
not
be
our
position
at--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--we
think
it
is
protected
by
the
participation
clause.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
--
that
would
--
that
would
certainly
be
fine
with
us.
mr.
eric
schnapper
we
get
to
the
same
place
--
we
get
to
the
same
place
by
a
different
route.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no.
we
believe
it
is
covered
by
the
participation
clause.
we
think--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--because
our
view
is
that
the
employer's
internal
processes
for
detecting
and
rooting
out
sexual
harassment,
for
example,
is
a
--
is
a
process
--
is
a
process
that's
under
this
title
within
the
meaning
of--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--it
--
it
is
not,
your
honor.
but
--
but
as
the
--
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
i'm
--
you
know,
i'm
here
to
answer
hypothetical
questions,
and
i'm
going
to
do
so.
mr.
eric
schnapper
your
honor,
there
actually
are
two
distinct
questions
here.
one
of
them
is
whether
the
conduct
is
protected
by
the
opposition
clause
and
whether
it
constitutes
opposition.
the
second
question
is
whether
this
conduct
is
protected
by
the
participation
clause
and
would
be
an
investigation
under
title
vii.
we
are
asserting
arguments
under
both
claims,
and
--
and
the
respondents
disagree
with
us
on
both.
mr.
eric
schnapper
redundant.
mr.
eric
schnapper
right.
this
case
is
both.
but
--
but
there
are
circumstances
which
are
only
one
or
the
other.
and
this
is
--
this
is
a
statute
that
--
that
is
deliberately
written
with
overlapping
provisions
to
be
sure
nothing
is
missed.
in
the
phrase
in
the
fort
stewart
case,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
it
is
ex
abundante
cotilla,
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution,
or
in
modern
terms
boots
--
belt
and
suspenders.
so
these
are
deliberately
overlapping
provisions
to
--
to
assure
that--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it
--
it
--
in
our
view,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
formal,
but
there
are
two
essential
elements
to
an
investigation
or
a
proceeding
or
anything
other
internal
being
under
this
title.
the
first
is
that
the
employer
must
have
a
rule
or
policy
forbidding
the
type
of
discrimination
in
question
which
is
similar
to
the
requirements
in
section
706(c)
for
state
and
local
agencies.
second,
the
individual
--
the
official
who
did
whatever
you
describe
has
to
have
been
specifically
authorized
by
the
employer
to
play
that
role.
vicarious
here
wouldn't
cover
it.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance.
mr.
eric
schnapper
thank
you,
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court:
protecting
witnesses
from
being
fired
because
they
provide
information
in
internal
investigates
is
not
going
to
interfere
with
the
conduct
of
those
investigations
or
deter
them.
we
know
that
from
experience.
until
the
decision
in
this
case,
no
one
had
questioned
the
applicability
of
the
opposition
clause
to
a
witness
in
an
investigation
who
complains
about
sexual
harassment.
it
was
simply
not
in
dispute.
the
compliance
manual
in
this
regard
was
entirely
clear
since
2000
because
the
commission
took
the
position
witnesses
who
complained
were
protected
by
the
opposition
clause.
none
of
the
problems
mr.
young
expressed
concern
about
had
happened.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
she
said
she
thought
it
was
easier.
we
don't
have
a
preference.
but
i'd
like
to
address
briefly
the
participation
clause.
the
participation
clause
does
have
the
singular
value,
as
justice
alito
suggested,
that
it
is
evenhanded,
that
it
will
protect
witnesses
for
both
sides.
and
the
integrity
of
the
process
is
certainly
strengthened
if
both
witnesses,
witnesses
on
both
sides,
know
they're
protected
from
retaliation.
mr.
eric
schnapper
but
the
question
is
under
this
title.
that
language
its
certainly
broad
enough,
as
justice
souter
suggested,
to
encompass
the
sort
of
process
that's
at
issue
here.
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
this
court's
decisions
in
faragher
virtually
mandate
these
decisions.
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
point--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
think
the
words
under
this
title
are
elastic
enough
to
support
either
meaning.
the
context
of
the
statute
and
the
way
this
court
has
repeatedly
construed
it
give
meaning
to
it.
in
response
to
the
concern
that
the
chief
justice
raised,
faragher
and
ellerth
are
not
the
only
decisions
that
provide
an
incentive
for
these
investigations.
the
court's
decision
in
kolstad
makes
the
existence
of
this
sort
of
process
essential
to
avoid
awards
of
punitive
damages.
so
even
in
non-harassment
cases
that
same
incentive
has
been
created
by
the
courts.
in
a
situation
involving
harassment,
the
contours
of
the
investigation
are
fact
largely
shaped
by
federal
law,
not
only
policy
guidance
which
the
eeoc
has
issued
helping
employers
figure
out
what
to
do,
but
a
large
and
growing
body
of
case
law
under
faragher
and
ellerth
elucidating
what
those
requirements
are.
particularly
importantly
here,
the
victims
of
sexual
harassment
are
virtually
required
by
the
court
to
use
these
processes.
ms.
crawford
had
to
speak
up
at
some
point
or
she
had
had
no
claim.
and
last,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
sexual
harassment
is
going
to
be
stopped,
it's
mostly
going
to
happen
through
these
internal
processes.
by
the
time
most
of
these
controversies
about
sexual
harassment
get
to
the
eeoc
or
the
courts,
the
victims
have
left
their
jobs.
in
this
court's
decision
in
pollard,
the
individual
had
been
fired.
in
souter
she
had
been
driven
from
her
job.
in
faragher
and
ellerth
and
harris,
those
victims
had
quit.
if
you
look
at
the
array
of
lower
court
decisions
involving
sexual
harassment,
by
the
time
a
case
gets
to
the
commission
in
most
of
those
cases
the
victim
has
given
up
and
left.
so
it's
exceptionally
important
that
these
processes
be
effective
and
evenhanded.
no
further
questions.
