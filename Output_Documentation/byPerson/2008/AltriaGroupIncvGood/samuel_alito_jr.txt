mr.
frederick,
suppose
that
the
ftc
had
adopted
the
rule
that
it
considered
in
1970
and
required
that
the
tar
and
nicotine
figures
that
were
produced
by
the
particular
testing
method
that
is
at
issue
here
to
be
placed
on
all
cigarette
ads
and
promotions;
and
then
suppose
that
maine
issued
a
regulation
requiring
that
all
ads
and
promotions
in
the
state
of
maine
state
that
the
federal
figures
are
misleading
and
should
be
disregarded.
would
that
regulation
be
pre-empted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
the
difference
between
that
situation
and
this
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
weren't
the
claims
that
were
held
to
be
preempted
in
cipollone
based
on
general
common
law
duties?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
the
ftc
at
this
point
in
2008
have
an
opinion
about
whether
the
tar
and
nicotine
figures
that
are
produced
by
this
testing
method
are
meaningful
or
misleading?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
it
be
--
would
it
be
unfair
to
say
that
for
quite
sometime
now,
nearly
40
years,
the
ftc
has
passively
approved
the
placement
of
these
tar
and
nicotine
figures
in
advertisement?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
passed
a
rule
to
require
it,
did
you
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
withdrew
that
after
the
companies
voluntarily
agreed
to
place
the
information
on
the
ads--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
entered
into
consent
decrees
with
other
companies
requiring
them
to
put
information
in
their
ads.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
was
there
a
different
between
saying
"light"
and
saying
"lower
in
tar"
in
accordance
with
the
cambridge
testing
method?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
ftc's
position
seems
to
me
incomprehensible.
if
these
figures
are
meaningless,
then
you
should
have
prohibited
them
--
are
misleading,
you
should
have
prohibited
them
a
long
time
ago.
and
you've
created
this
whole
problem
by,
i
think,
passively
approving
the
placement
of
these
figures
on
the
--
on
--
in
the
advertisements.
and
if
they
are
misleading,
then
you
have
misled
everybody
who's
bought
those
cigarette
for
a
long
time.
