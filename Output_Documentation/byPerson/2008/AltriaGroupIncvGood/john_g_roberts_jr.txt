chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
term
in
altria
group
v.
stephanie
good.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
olson,
what
if
the
state
law
claim
did
not
require
any
inquiry
into
the
relationship
between
smoking
and
health?
something
along
the
lines
of
saying
our
studies
show
that
light
cigarettes
are
healthier
for
you,
and
in
fact
their
studies
show
the
opposite.
so
all
you,
all
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
show
is
that
there
was
a
deception,
a
disconnect
between
the
studies
and
the
ad.
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
light
cigarettes
were
healthier
or
not
healthier.
is
that
the
type
of
action
that
could
be
brought?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
that
consistent
with
what
the
court
said
in
the
riegel
case
where
they
said,
and
i'll
quote:
"we
have
held
that
a
provision
pre-empting
state
requirements
pre-empted
common
law
duties?
"
that's
no
suggestion
that
this
is
a
distinction
between
a
focused
common
law
duty,
which
would
be
unusual
anyway,
and
general
common
law
duty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
riegel
wasn't
referring
to
the
particular
text
of
any
statue.
it
was
making
a
general
point.
the
court
said:
we
have
held
that
a
provision
pre-empting
state
requirements,
which
is
exactly
what
this
one
does,
pre-empted
common
law
duties.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
as
a
general
proposition
--
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
this
particular
statute
doesn't
pre-empt
the
common
law
duties,
but
the
distinction
i
thought
you
articulated
in
response
to
justice
alito's
question
was
that
general
common
law
duties
are
not
pre-empted;
specific
tailored
ones
are.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
agree
that
a
general
common
law
duty
can
be
pre-empted
by
a
particular
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
--
so
you're
saying
that
we
should
--
the
difference
in
your
case
is
that
the
language
here
is
narrower.
it
says
"no
statement
relating
to
smoking
or
health.
"
i
don't
see
how
that
language
is
narrower.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
1334(b)
says
"no
requirement
or
prohibition
with
respect
to.
"
isn't
that
just
as
broad?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
tell
--
how
do
you
tell
whether
it's
deceptive
or
not
if
you
don't
look
at
what
the
relationship
is
between
smoking
and
health?
they
have
an
advertisement
that
says
light
cigarettes
are
better
for
you
than
regular
cigarettes.
you
have
to
know
what
the
relationship
is
between
smoking
and
health
to
determine
whether
that's
deceptive.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
relationship
between
smoking
and
health.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
frederick,
did
i
understand
you
earlier
to
say
that
your
complaint
did
not
seek
injunctive
relief?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
page
42a
of
your
amended
complaint
says
you
ask
the
court
to
grant
such
injunctive
relief
as
may
be
appropriate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
hallward-driemeier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
will
not
surprise
you
that
my
first
question
is,
why
did
the
united
states
not
address
the
express
pre-emption
argument
and,
second,
what
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
on
the
express
pre-emption
argument?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
well,
that's
why
you
didn't
address
it.
now,
what
is
the
position
of
the
united
states?
it's
a
statute
that
is
directed
to
an
area
in
which
the
federal
government
has
an
extensive
interest
in
regulation,
and
i
would
have
thought
there'd
be
a
position
on
that.
it
is
logically
antecedent
to
the
implied
pre-emption.
you
would
consider
whether
there
is
express
pre-emption
before
implied
pre-emption.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
not
anymore.
i
understood
--
i
understood
mr.
olson
to
give
up
on
implied
pre-emption
in
his
opening
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
implied
pre-emption
is
all
that
you
address,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
should
be
pretty
easy
for
you
to
win
on
that.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
olson,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
just
didn't
want
to
argue
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-562,
altria
group
versus
good
and
that
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
