mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
congress
enacted
the
labeling
act,
the
1969
labeling
act,
it
gave
no
intention
whatsoever
to
immunize
cigarette
makers
for
the
false
statements
that
they
made
in
violation
of
anti-deception
in
the
marketplace
rules.
they
didn't
empower
the
ftc
with
any
special
rulemaking
authority
that
applied
industrywide,
and
in
fact
the
ftc's
enforcement
authority
with
respect
to
individual
companies
was
quite
limited.
the
argument
that
philip--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
would
be
implied
conflict
pre-emption,
and
we
would
acknowledge
that
would
be
pre-empted.
the
difference
here--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
difference
here
is
that
between
a
generally
applicable
rule
that
is
specially
targeted
at
the
cigarette
industry
and
a
generally
applicable
rule
against
deception,
upon
which
a
fact
finder
would
not
need
to
make
any
special
inquiry
about
smoking
and
health.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
i
have
three
responses,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
is
that
the
text
in
riegel
was
different;
the
purposes
behind
what
congress
enacted
in
the
medical
device
amendments
were
different;
and
third,
this
court
twice,
in
both
reilly
and
in
cipollone,
has
looked
at
this
exact
statute
and
come
to
the
opposite
conclusion.
first
with
respect
to
the
text
of
the
medical
device
amendments,
there
are
several
provisions
of
that
act
that
are
quite
a
bit
broader
than
what
the
1969
labeling
act--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
the
result,
mr.
chief
justice,
of
virtually
every
one
of
this
court's
pre-emption
cases
has
been
to
look
at
the
particular
words
of
the
statute
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
pre-emption.
the
court
did
that
in
bates.
it
did
that
in
morales.
it
did--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
do
acknowledge
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
my
point
is
that
in
the
medical
device
amendments
what
congress
was
getting
at
were
things
that
were
quite
a
bit
broader
and
it
had
sweeping
language.
it
said
not
only
to
establish
but
also
to
continue
in
effect,
with
respect
to
a
device,
which
relates
to
the
safety
or
effectiveness
of
the
device,
or
"to
any
other
matter
included
in
a
requirement
applicable
to
the
device.
"
by
contrast--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
i
think
you're
quoting
1334(a)
and
the
pre-emption
provision
at
issue
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
1334(b)
which
says--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
no,
it
isn't,
because
the
modifying
term
that's
at
issue
in
this
case
comes
between
the
two
points
that
you
quoted,
and
that's
the
phrase
"based
on
smoking
and
health".
our
contention
here
is
that
a
generalized
duty
not
to
deceive
is
not
a
requirement
based
on
smoking
and
health.
it's
based
on
a
duty
not
to
deceive.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
you
don't.
you
have
to
look
at
two
products
and
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
achieving
the
same
yield
of
tar
and
nicotine
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
the
word
1334(b),
and
that
is
crucial
because
this
court
in
safeco
v.
burr
defined
the
phrase
"based
upon"
to
mean
but-for
causation:
but
for
smoking
and
health,
is
there
a
requirement?
the
words
erisa
cases,
to
be
among
the
most
sweeping
language
that
congress
can
use
to
denote
a
connection.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
the
damages
here,
mr.
justice
kennedy,
are
--
concern
getting
two
products
that
are
not
different.
it's
just
like
going
to
a
car
dealer
and
saying,
i
want
a
ford
and
they--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
think
we
would
accept
that,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
fact
in
our
case
we
are
not
proving
health-related
damages.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
we
are
not
asking
for
injunctive
relief.
we
are
asking
damages
for
the
difference
in
value
between
a
product
we
thought
we
were
buying
and
a
product
we
actually
bought.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter.
i
think
all
we
have
to
prove
is
that
the
products
were
different
and
that
we
relied
materially
on
a
misrepresentation
about
what
product
to
use.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
i
do,
because
our
damages
here,
justice
souter--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--if
we
bought
a
product
thinking
that
it
would
be
a
safer
product
and
it
was
not,
and
we
would
have
quit
smoking.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we're
--
yes,
we
do,
because
the
product
is
different.
if
you
buy
a
car
thinking
it's
a
ford
and
it's
a
yugo
but
it
still
drives,
you
still
have
a
claim
under
the
lemon
laws
for
deceptive
advertising.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
is
an
economic
proof--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--there
is
economic
evidence,
justice
scalia,
of
a
difference
in
value,
and
of
course
the
pre-emption
--
the
issue
here
is
not--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--they
did
not
charge
more
for
light
cigarettes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
economists
have
projected
that
if
a
person
would
have
quit
smoking
and,
therefore,
not
purchased
light
cigarettes
or
would
have
paid
a
different
amount
of
money
thinking
it
was
getting
a
safer
cigarette,
there
is
an
economic
value--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--certainly.
and
the
point
here
about
the
advertising--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
souter,
i
don't
think
that
the
liability
requirement
here,
the
rule
of
law
that
is
being
imposed
under
bates
--
what
bates
said
was
that
you
look
at
the
elements
of
the
claim
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
requirements
are
imposed
by
state
law.
the
requirement
that
we
seek
to
impose
here
is
the
duty
not
to
deceive--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--we
are
not
making
the
same
argument
here
for
two
reasons:
one
is
that
the
main
statute
is
not
specially
targeted
at
cigarette
smoking.
it's
specially
targeted
at
deception
in
the
marketplace.
under
your
hypothetical
it
would
be
specially
targeted
at
cigarette
companies.
under
reilly
that
would
be
preempted.
secondly,
skull
and
crossbones
i
think--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
statute
we
seek
to
invoke
is
a--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because
the
statute--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--you
looked
at
it
because
the
statute
required
you
to
look
at
it
as
applicable,
and
the
purposes
behind
that
act
were
to
give
the
fda
authority
at
the
premarketing
--
and
purposes
behind
the
medical
device
amendment
were
completely
different.
the
ftc
does
not
look
at
these
marketing
materials
before
the
cigarette
companies
do
that.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
1969
labeling
act,
congress
confronted
the
spectra
of
states
imposing
warning
requirements.
and
the
tobacco
companies
went
to
congress
and
said,
we
do
not
want
special
burdens
imposed
on
us.
we
don't
want
special
advantages,
but
please
don't
impose
special
burdens
on
the
cigarette
industry.
and
congress
said,
we
will
wipe
away
the
prospect
of
state
imposing
warnings
by
having
a
congressionally
mandated
warning
on
the
cigarette
packs
and
in
cigarette
advertising.
the
congress
said
nothing
about
having
anti-deception
laws
be
displaced
by
states.
so
that
in,
in
the
hair
hypo
that
you
gave,
i
think
mr.
olson
would
have
to
acknowledge
that
the
cigarette
companies
were
not
asking
at
the
time
of
the
'69
labeling
act
to
be
free
of
anti-deception
laws.
they
had
been
out
for
decades
saying
cigarette
smoking
cures
the
common
cold,
it
makes
the
throat
feel
better,
all
sorts
of
health-related
claims
that
were
deceptive.
and
congress
was
not
trying
to
wipe
that
away.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
are
not
here
seeking
injunctive
relief
for
this--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
misspoke,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
apologies
to
the
court.
our
claim
here,
though,
principally
is
for
damages.
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
any
injunction
that
would
have
been
ordered
here
would
be
superseded
by
the
united
states
rico
case,
where
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
has
already
issued
an
injunction
for
the
use
of
light
cigarettes
because
judge
kessler
found
in
more
than
4,000
findings
of
fact
that
philip
morris
had
engaged
in
deception
in
the
marketplace
and
findings
of
fact,
beginning
2023
and
following--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
consent
decree
in
the
master
settlement
agreement
does
not
address
itself
to
specific
issues
with
regard
to
light
and
low
tar,
to
my
knowledge.
the
kessler
order
does
address
the
deception
by
lights
and
low
tar,
and
the
reason
is
temporal.
when
the
master
settlement
agreement
was
entered
into
in
the
late
'90s,
the
tobacco
companies
had
not
yet
acknowledged
publicly
that
they
had
been
engaged
in
deception
with
respect
to
studies
regarding
low
tar
and
light
cigarette.
that
came
to
light
in
2002,
and
as
a
result
of
the
discovery
that
occurred
in
the
government's
case
and
in
state
cases,
the
studies
that
the
cigarette
companies
knew
for
decades
that
there
was
no
difference
in
the
yield
for
low
tar
and
light
cigarettes
came
to
light.
and
so,
the
master
settlement
agreement
was
not
--
it
had
certain
provisions
about
the
way
cigarettes
could
be
marketed
but
--
but
the
judge
kessler
opinion,
in
the
government's
rico
case,
actually
makes
findings
of
fact
on
this
score.
and
the
complaint
here
essentially
tracks
the
allegations
in
the
government's.
all
we
seek
to
do
is
to
provide
a
remedy
to
consumers
that
have
been
defrauded
by
philip
morris
over
these
many
decades.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
that
would
fall
into
the
reilly
line
of
being
preempted,
because
it
would
be
specially
targeted
and
there
would
be
no
room
for
a
cigarette
maker
to
say
truthfully
our
product
actually
does
yield
lower
and
light.
so,
it
could
not
be
a
requirement
based
on
deception.
it
would
have
to
be
a
requirement
based
on
smoking
and
health
under
your
hypothetical.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
they
were.
those
--
the
fraudulent
neutralization
of
warning
claim
and
the
failure
to
warn
claim
were
common
law
claims,
justice
alito,
but
the
difference
here
is
that
in
cipollone
the
plurality
plus
the
three
justices
who
joined
justice
blackmun's
opinion
and
would
have
found
no
common
law
claims
preempted.
seven
justices
found
fraud
claims
that
are
virtually
identical
to
ours
not
to
be
preempted
because
congress
lacked
any
intent
to
displace
state
laws
concerning
deception.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
requirement
is
what
i
would
urge
you
to
focus
on,
justice
kennedy.
and
the
requirement
that
is
being
imposed
here
is
not
a
requirement
that
has
to
do
specifically
with
smoking
and
health.
there
is
a
second
argument,
which
is
that
even
under
the
application
of
that
generalized
duty,
the
jury
here
or
the
trial
court
would
not
be
asked
to
look
at
the
linkage
between
smoking
and
health.
it
could
simply
say,
have
a
scientist
up
there
who
says
the
yield
of
a
light
cigarette
is
no
different
than
the
yield
of
a
regular
cigarette.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
that
was
the
general
purpose
of
the
statute.
there
is
language,
of
course,
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
stevens.
and
here
what
we
are
talking
about
with
these
light
descriptors
are
comparisons
between
two
products
that,
in
fact,
are
not
different.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
the
attorney
general
could
bring
the
same
suit
that
we
bring
here,
justice
kennedy.
the
difference
is
between
a--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
let
me
answer
the
hypothetical
this
way:
the
attorney
general
can
bring
the
lawsuit
under
the
state
deceptive
practices
act
but
cannot
issue
a
generalized
regulation
targeted
at
the
cigarette
industry
that
takes
truth
completely
out
of
the
equation,
because
if
another
cigarette
company
comes
up
and
says,
"we
actually
have
a
light
cigarette
that
is
lower
in
tar.
"
and
we
can
prove
it--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
think
that's
a
much
more
difficult
hypo,
but
i
think
the
answer
is
the
same
and
that
would
be
no,
because
a
regulation
would
be
--
would
be
specifically
targeted
at
the
industry
and
it
would
be
based
on
smoking
and
health,
not
deception.
in
an
injunctive
situation,
adjudicatory
facts
can
evolve.
a
company
can
come
forward
and
say
the
facts
have
changed,
circumstances
have
changed,
please
modify
the
injunction.
that
can't
happen
when
a
generalized
regulation
is
imposed
that
is
specifically
targeted
at
facts
regardless
of
their
truth
or
veracity.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
the
--
if
the
company
came
forward
and
said,
"we
redesigned
our
cigarette",
and
it
in
fact
does
yield
less
tar
and
nicotine
under
a
scientifically
verifiable
test,
that
would
be
--
that
would
run
afoul
of
the
regulation,
but
it
would
not
run
afoul
of
the
general
duty
not
to
deceive.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you.
