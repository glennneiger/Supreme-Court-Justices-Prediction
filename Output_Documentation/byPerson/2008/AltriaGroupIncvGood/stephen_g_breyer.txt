justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
your
view,
it
says
in
cipollone
that
this
--
that
the
four
people
said
in
cipollone
that
this
statute
does
not
pre-empt
state
law
where
it's
based
on
a
prohibition
of
making
a
false
statement
of
material
fact.
for
example,
to
make
a
funny
example,
somebody
could
advertise
smoking
42
cigarettes
a
day
will
grow
back
your
hair.
[laughter]
that's
totally
false,
and
in
your
view,
that
would
be
pre-empted,
if
congress
attempted
to
pre-empt
a
state
law
that
says
you
cannot
make
a
completely
false
statement
of
material
fact--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
it's
based
on
--
has
something
to
do
with
smoking
and
health.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
was
trying
to
produce
an
--
i
mean,
it
will
build
strong
bodies
eight
ways.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
excuse
me.
the
reason
i
think
the
plurality
wrote
this,
i'm
guessing,
is
that
when
you
read
through
this
statute
it
seems
as
if
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
statute
was
not
setting
aside
state
law,
which
is
tradition,
about
not
making
false
statements,
false
and
deceptive
advertising
law.
it
was
concerned
with
a
different
thing.
they
said,
to
the
cigarette
companies:
you
have
to
put
on
the
label
"smoking
is
dangerous
to
your
health.
"
we
don't
want
states
telling
you
to
put
other
things
like
that
on
the
label,
and
we
don't
want
states
forbidding
you
to
put
a
picture
of
the
marlboro
man
or
lauren
bacall
with
her
cigarette.
we
don't
want
states
to
tell
you
that
you
can't
do
that.
that
would
be
focused
on
the
object
of
the
statute,
which
no
one
said
had
as
its
objective
setting
aside
traditional
unfair
and
deceptive
advertising
law.
i
think
that's
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
--
why
would
congress
--
i
mean
the
difficulty
that
the
other
side
raises
here
is
just
what
cipollone
said.
i
can
understand
totally
why
congress
would
not
want
50
states
telling
cigarette
companies
what
to
say
about
health
and
smoking
or
taking
off
pictures
of
the
marlboro
ad.
i
can
understand
that.
what
i
can't
understand
is
why
congress
would
want
to
get
rid
of,
in
this
area,
the
traditional
rule
that
advertising
has
to
tell
the
truth.
now,
what
you
said
was
you
could
end
up
with
different
applications
of
that
in
different
states.
of
course,
every
national
advertiser
faces
that
situation
at
the
moment.
everyone
who
advertises
across
the
nation
could
find
deceptive
--
anti-deception
laws
differently
administered
in
different
states.
yet,
they'd
survive.
there
is
no
evidence
even
that
there
is
a
problem.
so
why
would
congress
want
to
get
rid
of
that
particular
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
couldn't
you
say
exactly
the
same
thing
about
a
state
mode
seeks
to
protect
consumers,
and
they
have
a
--
they
have
a
rule,
and
the
rule
is
not
only
the
cigarette
company
do
you
have
to
say
cigarettes
are
dangerous
to
your
health,
you
have
to
put
skull
and
crossbones?
that's
the
state
law.
and
you
say
why?
they
say
because
we
are
trying
to
protect
consumers.
and
then
you
would
be
up
here
saying,
they
are
not
trying
--
the
duty
there
is
not
the
duty
to
put
the
skull
and
crossbones.
it's
the
duty
to
protect
consumers.
now,
that
argument
would
get
nowhere,
as
you
understand.
and
they
are
saying
you're
making
just
that
kind
of
argument
here,
except
substitute
the
word
"deception".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
want
you
to
get
you
to
talk
about
just
for
me
for
30
seconds.
i
can't
deal
with
this
conceptual
thing.
it
was
hard
for
me
to
see
it
conceptually.
i
can
understand
--
and
that
may
be
enough
to
any
other
person
here,
but
i
can
understand
somebody
saying
yes,
this
language
is
very
absolute
but
it
doesn't
mean
to
cover
everything
that
it
literally
applies
to.
for
example,
it
probably
doesn't
cover
a
requirement
about
workers
smoking
who
put
up
billboards.
and
another
thing
you
say
it
doesn't
cover
is
traditional
anti-deception
law.
that
would
have
to
do
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute
not
the
text.
i'm
not
making
your
argument
for
you.
i'm
giving
you
an
introduction,
and
i
want
you
to
give
30
seconds
dealing
with
the
purposes
that
either
says
there
is
something
to
that
line
or
there
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
the
point,
it
doesn't
pre-empt
rules
about
location;
it
pre-empts
rules
about
content?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
government's
position.
now,
if
that's
their
position,
isn't
it
just
one
additional
step
to
say
depending
on
what
the
history
of
the
statute
is,
that
it
pre-empts
regulations
about
content
that
don't
have
to
do
with
lying
about
the
content?
