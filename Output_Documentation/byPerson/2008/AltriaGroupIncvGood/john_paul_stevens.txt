mr.
olson,
you're
relying
on
1334(b),
i
take
it,
specifically.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
prohibition
you're
talking
about
is
in
13
--
in
your
express
pre-emption
argument
--
1334(b).
and
i
was
just
going
to
ask
you,
is
a
state
requirement
prohibiting
false
statements
about
smoking
and
health
a
requirement
based
on
smoking
and
health?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
predicate
for
"based
on
smoking"
is
the
word
"requirement".
and
a
requirement
that
you
may
not
make
any
false
statements,
would
that
be
a
requirement
based
on
smoking
and
health?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
i'm
asking,
though,
is
a
requirement
that
you
make
no
false
statements
a
requirement
based
on
smoking
and
health?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
the
illinois
--
illinois
court
reach
the
question
whether
the
claim
was
pre
--
pre-empted?
i
think
it
firmly
decided
on
the
merits
there
was
no
fraud,
if
i
understand
what
you
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
must
assume
there
was
no
pre-emption,
because
it
wouldn't
have
reached
the
merits
otherwise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
it's
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
understand
your
basic
argument
to
be
that
this
statute
is
a
prohibition
against
state
warnings
in
either
promotion
or
advertising
different
from
the
federal
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
specific
quotation
deals
only
with
the
contents
of
the
advertising
that
might
be
described
as
warnings
different
from
those
in
the
federal
scheme.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
correct
that
your
argument
requires
us
to
reject
the
fraud
analysis
in
cipollone?
