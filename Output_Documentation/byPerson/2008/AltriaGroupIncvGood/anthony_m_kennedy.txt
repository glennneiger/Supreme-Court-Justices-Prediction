but
suppose
that
a
new
drug
is
found
for
the
treatment
of
a
condition,
glaucoma
--
hypothetical
--
and
the
evidence
is
stunningly
clear
that
smoking
with
this
new
drug
causes
a
severe
allergic
reaction.
does
the
cigarette
manufacturer
have
any
duty
to
disclose
this
on
the
label
or
in
promotions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i
--
they've
just
found
this
out
last
week.
do
they
have
any
--
there
can
be
no
--
i
take
it
under
your
position
there
can
be
no
suit
based
on
misleading
or
false
promotion
or
labeling,
and
there
can
be
no
suit
even
for
the
sale
of
an
unsafe
item?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
have
--
would
have
you
been
satisfied
if
your
complaint
said
this
complaint
does
not
seek
any
damages
based
on
the
link
between
smoking
and
health?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
accept
that
amendment
to
your
complaint,
that
the
plaintiff
does
not
seek
any
damages
based
on
some
link
between
smoking
and
health?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
what
are
your
damages?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
frederick,
if
i
take
away
from
your
oral
argument
that
it
is
your
position
that
this
suit
is
not
based
on
a
link
between
smoking
and
health,
i'm
going
to
have
difficulty
in
accepting
your
position
in
this
entire
case.
do
you
have
a
secondary
position
that
it
is
based
on
a
link
between
smoking
and
health
but
it
is
subject
to
a
general
duty,
that
is,
that
supersedes
or
is
quite
in
addition
to
labeling?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
was
that
the
state
attorney
general
could
not
impose
a
regulation
that
said
you
must
say
that
low
tar
cigarettes
have
as
much
nicotine
as
regular
cigarettes.
if
the
attorney
general
couldn't
do
that,
why
could
the
plaintiff
do
it
in
his
lawsuit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
the
hypothetical
was
the
attorney
general
requires
this
as
a
regulation
under
his
authority.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
respondents
for
many
years,
smokes
cigarettes
manufactured
by
the
petitioners,
cigarettes
marketed
by
the
petitioners
as
being
light
or
low
tar.
in
2005,
respondents
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court.
the
suit
alleged
that
those
cigarettes
do
not
in
fact
deliver
less
tar
than
regular
cigarettes.
it
further
alleged
that
petitioner's
fraudulent
concealment
of
that
fact
violated
the
maine
unfair
trade
practices
act.
in
the
district
court,
the
petitioners
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
cigarette
labeling
and
advertising
act
as
amended
expressly
preempts
the
respondent's
claims.
the
labeling
act
provides
that
no
requirement
or
provision
based
on
smoking
and
health
shall
be
imposed
under
state
law
with
respect
to
the
advertising
or
promotion
of
any
cigarettes
that
are
labeled
in
conformity
with
the
federal
law.
the
petitioners
also
argued
that
respondent's
claim
is
impliedly
preempted
because
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
trade
commission
policy
encouraging
cigarette
manufacturers'
use
of
light
and
low
tar
descriptors.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
petitioners.
it
concluded
that
the
respondent's
claim
is
expressly
preempted
because
it
seeks
to
require
or
prohibit
certain
statements
in
petitioner's
advertising
based
on
smoking
and
health.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
reversed.
it
characterized
respondent's
claim
as
a
fraud
claim
and
so
not
based
on
smoking
and
health.
the
court
of
appeals
held
the
claim
is
not
expressly
preempted.
it
also
rejected
petitioner's
implied
preemption
argument.
it
found
no
federal
policy
incurred
in
cigarette
manufacturers
to
use
light
or
low
tar
descriptors.
we
granted
certiorari
to
address
both
the
express
and
implied
preemption
questions.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
stevens,
we
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
16
years
ago
in
cipollone
versus
liggett
group,
the
court
held
that
the
labeling
act
did
not
preempt
a
common
law
claim
that
cigarette
manufacturers
had
fraudulently
concealed
a
material
fact
about
their
product.
the
state
statute
under
which
respondents
in
this
case
filed
suit
prohibits
deceptive
acts
or
practices
in
the
conduct
of
any
trade
or
commerce.
like
the
fraud
claim
in
cipollone,
respondent's
claim
alleges
a
breach
of
the
duty
not
to
deceive,
a
duty
that
is
not
based
on
smoking
and
health.
we
now
follow
our
disposition
of
the
common
law
fraud
claim
in
cipollone
in
rejecting
petitioner's
argument
that
the
similar
statutory
claim
in
this
case
is
preempted.
we
also
reject
petitioner's
contention
that
respondents'
claim
is
impliedly
preempted
because
it
will
present
an
obstacle
to
a
longstanding
policy
of
the
ftc.
petitioners
argue
that
the
ftc
has
for
decades
promoted
the
development
and
consumption
of
low
tar
cigarettes
and
has
encouraged
consumers
to
rely
on
manufacturers'
representations
of
tar
and
nicotine
content.
our
study
of
the
regulatory
history
however,
reveals
no
such
policy.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
scalia
and
alito
have
joined.
