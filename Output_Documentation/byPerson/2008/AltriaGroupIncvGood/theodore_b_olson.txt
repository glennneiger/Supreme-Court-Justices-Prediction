mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents'
state
law
claims
track
nearly
verbatim
the
cigarette
labeling
act's
pre-emption
provision.
for
example,
the
complaint
challenges
promotions
of
light
cigarettes
as
less
harmful
and
safer
to
smokers
than
regular
cigarettes.
but
the
statute,
congress,
explicitly
preempted
any
requirement
respecting
the
promotion
of
cigarettes
based
upon
smoking
and
health.
in
short,
the
respondents
are
seeking
in
state
court
precisely
what
congress
pre-empted.
there
is
no
space--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
think
the
facts
could
differ
from
case
to
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
inquiry
is
going
to
be
generally,
i
think,
simple:
is
there
a
requirement?
is
it
based
upon
smoking
and
health,
and
does
it
appear
in
an
advertising
or
promotion
of
a
cigarette.
now,
i
suppose
there
might
be
conceivably
circumstances
where
it's
impossible
to
tell
that
the
requirement
is
not
connected
in
some
way
with
smoking
and
health,
but
it's
certainly
clear
here.
the
complaint
specifically
talks
in
terms
of
promoting
cigarettes,
purporting
to
be
less
harmful
or
safer,
despite
serious
health
problems
associated
with
smoking.
these
appear
at
the
beginning
in
paragraph
2
of
the
amended
complaint
which
is
at
pages,
beginning
joint
appendix
pages
26
through
28.
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
paragraph
2
of
the
amended
complaint
and
paragraphs
15
and
18
of
the
amended
complaint.
in
fact,
the
words
12
times
in
the
amended
complaint.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that
there
is.
in
answer
to
the
general
question
that
you
ask,
justice
gins
burg,
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
an
attorney
general
to
pursue
deceptive
advertising.
another
example
--
and
i'll
come
to
the
one
you
mentioned
--
is
that
someone
might
misrepresent
the
number
of
cigarettes
in
a
package
or
other
things
having
to
do
with
cigarettes.
that
would
not
necessarily
be
related
to
smoking
and
health.
so
there
is
not
a
pre-emption
if
there
is
not
a
relationship
between
the
prohibition
and
smoking
and
health.
the
example
you
gave
might
require
some
sort
of
inquiry
as
to
what
is
motivating
the
attorney
general.
the
motivation
is
what
you
referred
to,
your
court
referred
to
in
the
reilly
case
and
i
would
say--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
that's
probably
true
in
most
cases,
justice
souter,
that
the
reason
why
there
might
be
regulations
at
the
state
level
having
to
do
with
cigarettes
and
advertising
by
and
large
is
going
to
have
to
do
with
smoking
and
health.
the
court
went
through
the
same
inquiry
in
the
reilly
case
where
it
had
to
do
with
billboards
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
--
if
the
courts
were
to
conclude
that
it
had
a
relationship
with
smoking
and
health,
the
answer
is
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
but
there
might
be
some
case
in
which
someone
said,
well,
the
issue
about
nicotine
and
content
of
nicotine
is
being
regulated
because
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
smoking
and
health,
but
in
the
environment
in
which
this
--
this
statute
was
passed
and
this
litigation
was
pursued,
there
certainly
isn't
any
question
here.
now,
i
think
justice
stevens,
even
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
reilly
case,
focused
on
the
content.
he
said
and
the
--
your
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case
said,
as
opposed
to
location,
that
the
labeling
act
was
focusing
on
the
content
of
advertising.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
justice
kennedy,
to
the
--
the
federal
trade
commission,
by
the
way,
has
full
authority
to
regulate
deceptive--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there
could
be
--
the
states
may
regulate
the
sale
of
items.
the
labeling
act
provision
only
relates
to
promotion,
marketing,
advertising,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
the
state
can
prohibit
the
sale
of
cigarettes.
states
and
municipalities
have
done
that
sort
of
thing.
this
statute
has
three
provisions
in
it:
is
what
the
state
is
attempting
to
do
a
requirement
or
prohibition.
there's
no
question
that
that's
involved
here.
does
it
have
to
do
with
the
advertising
or
promotion
of
cigarettes?
there's
no
question
that
this
complaint
is
aimed
at
the
advertising
and
promotion
of
cigarettes.
and
does
the
advertising
or
promotion
have
to
do
with
smoking
and
health?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
mean
to
be
whimsical,
but
i
think
that,
to
the
extent
there's
a
representation
with
respect
to
growing
hair
or
something
like
that,
that
may
not
--
it
probably
isn't
--
have
to
do
with
smoking
and
health.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
and
let
me
say
with
respect
to
the
cipollone
plurality
opinion,
which
was
found
to
be
baffling,
confusing,
litigation-generating,
easily
abated
by
the
labeling
of
the
complaint,
and
superseded
by
a
number
of
subsequent
decisions
by
this
court,
it
should
be
set
aside
and
restated.
however,
the
very
case
that
the
cipollone
decision
in
the
plurality
did
decide
was
pre-empted
even
under
that
plurality
opinion,
and
this
is
at
page
527
of
the
opinion,
is
an
advertising
that
purported
to
neutralize,
minimize,
down-play,
negate,
or
disclaim
the
warning
label
on
the
packages.
this
complaint
is
precisely
that
claim.
you
could
probably
not
have
written
a
claim
more
squarely--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
is
the
argument,
and
the
respondents
are
making
that
argument.
i
submit
that
that
argument
is
squarely
answered
by
the
text
of
the
statute,
which
this
court
has
said
again
and
again
you
have
to
turn
to.
the
text
of
the
statute
says
no
requirement
or
prohibition;
it
doesn't
say
no
requirement
or
prohibition
except
one
which
is
expressly
misleading.
and
the
reason
you
mentioned,
justice
breyer,
what
was
the
background
for
the
statute
or
what
was
congress
intending
to
do,
well,
fortunately
on
section
1331
of
the
labeling
act,
which
is
on
1a
of
the
blue
brief,
congress
declares
its
policy
and
purpose
squarely,
unequivocally,
and
in
what
this
court
said
in
reilly
was
sweeping
language:
any
relationship
between
smoking
and
health.
and
then
congress
went
on
to
point
out
that
with
the
labeling
requirements,
it
intended
for
consumers
to
receive
certain
information
about
the
smoking
of
cigarettes
with
specific
labels,
and
then
went
on
to
say,
without
hurting
the
commerce
and
the
national
economy
to
be
protected
from
confusing
cigarette
labeling
and
advertising
regulations
that
might
be
"non-uniform,
confusing,
or
diverse.
"
now,
justice
stevens
again
in
the
reilly
opinion
when
he
was
distinguishing
in
his
concurring
opinion
--
i
can't
recall
whether
it's
a
concurring
or
dissenting
opinion
--
focused
on
the
fact
that
different
requirements
by
different
states
might
cause
those
very
diverse,
confusing
advertising.
if
one
state
says,
you've
got
to
put
something
else
in
there
about
this;
one
state
says
that
so-called
descriptors
are
misleading,
as
was
the
case
under
this
case,
and
another
state
says,
like
illinois
said
in
another
case,
that
they
are
not
misleading;
that
national
advertising
becomes
impossible.
that's
inconsistent
and
congress
expressed
what
its
policy
was.
and,
justice
breyer,
the
court
went
through
the
same
process
in
the
morales
case
and
the
wolens
case
in
connection
with
airline
and
deregulation
and
whether
or
not
misleading
advertising
might
be
expressly
pre-empted.
the
court
went
through
the
same
sort
of
process
in
the
riegel
case
with
respect
to
medical
devices.
the
court
went
through
the
same
process
in
the
rowe
case,
decided
on
the
same
day
as
riegel
in
connection
with
another
context.
and
again,
with
respect
to
the
reilly
case,
the
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
justice
stevens.
not
just
1334(b)
but
1331,
which
it
helps
explain.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
it
is,
unless
i
misunderstood
your
question.
if
a
state
decides
what
may
be
in
the
advertising
or
promotion--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
statute
contains
the
words
both
"requirement"
and
"prohibition".
and
in
your
plurality
opinion
in
cipollone
on
page
527,
the
same
page
i
mentioned
before,
you
made
the
point
that
a
prohibition
is
merely
the
converse
of
a
requirement.
and
either
a
prohibition
or
a
requirement
with
respect
to
advertising
if
it
relates
to
smoking
and
health
is
pre-empted.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
and
to
the
extent
--
no,
we
are
not
saying
that
the
massachusetts
unfairpractices
statute
is
preempted
in
all
respects.
it's
only
when
the
statute,
like
a
common
law
tort
provision
which
the
court
considered
in
riegel,
has
application
to
the
context
of
smoking
and
health.
if
the
court
starts
with
the
morales
case
through
the
wolens
case,
through
the
bates
case,
through
the
riegel
case,
through
the
reilly
case,
it's
the
application
of
the
statute
in
the
reilly
case.
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
statute
of
massachusetts
very
much
identical,
virtually
identical,
to
the
maine
statute
here.
and
in
the
--
in
the
reilly
case
the
attorney
general
was
attempting
to
apply
the
generalized,
unfair-practice
statute
to
the
advertising
of
smoking
and
cigarettes
near
schools.
this
is
a
similar
statute,
which
is
attempted
to
be
applied
in
the
context
of
these
labels
and
the
advertising
of
cigarettes.
it's
the
application
of
a
generalized
statute.
this
court
repeatedly
said,
and
specifically
said
in
the
riegel
case,
there
is
hardly
any
common
law
requirements
which
are
requirements,
the
court
has
repeatedly
held
--
and
the
respondents
don't
dispute
that;
they
specifically
acknowledge
it
--
when
it's
the
application
of
a
general
standard
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
that's
where
the
pre-emption
occurs.
congress
didn't
want
to
pre-empt
general
common
law
standards
about
fraud
or
misrepresentation
or
anything
like
that
except
in
the
context
of
the
marketing--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
court
--
and
this
court
recently
in
aetna
v.
davila
specifically
said
that
pre-emption
can't
be
decided
based
upon
the
label
that
the
plaintiff
puts
in
the
complaint.
now,
as
i
think
every
member
of
this
court
would
know,
a
creative
plaintiff's
lawyer
can
call
a
claim
misrepresentation,
willful
misrepresentation,
concealment,
failure
to
warn,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
it's
just
a
matter
of
how
they
change
the
label
on
the
complaint.
now,
what
congress
didn't
want
--
and
i
just
gave
an
example
of
a
situation
where
illinois
decided
that
the
descriptors,
which
are
an
issue
in
this
case
were
not
misleading;
and
it
was
not
--
and
they
could
continue
to
be
used.
what
happened
in
this
case
in
applying
the
maine
statute
is
a
court
decided
that
they
were
misleading
and
--
and
couldn't
be
used.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct,
and
i'm
not
saying--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
--
i
haven't
got
all
of
the
specifics
of
that
case;
but
what
i
felt
--
i
just
simply
meant
--
but
i
think
it's
an
example
of
what
you
said
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
reilly:
that
if
you're
going
to
conduct
a
national
advertising
campaign,
it
can't
be
governed
by
what
a
jury
might
decide
in
des
moines
versus
what
a
jury
might
decide
in
birmingham,
alabama.
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
no,
that's
absolutely
--
absolutely
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
in
fact,
the
panoply
of
this
court's
decisions
say
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
a
statute
--
a
generalized
statute
that's
being
applied
or
a
common
law
standard
that's
being
applied,
and
it
does
not
matter
whether
it's
an
attorney
general
interpreting
and
enforcing
general
provisions
--
i
give
you
morales
and
the
wolens
situation
--
or
it's
whether
it's
a
common
law
tort
action
being
brought
by
a
plaintiff
to
submit
a
case
to
a
jury
a
la
riegel.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
there
is
also
--
i
--
i
think
it
doesn't
--
it's
not
dispositive
of
the
pre-emption
case,
but
there's
also
the
master
settlement
agreement
that
the
tobacco
companies
entered
into
with
the
states,
which
gives
the
states
a
lot
of
power
to
enforce
various
different
things.
but
i
think
that
the
point
here
is
that,
yes,
congress
decided
that
it
wanted
one
uniform
source
of
regulation
of
advertising
of
cigarettes
with
respect
to
smoking
and
health.
now--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
master
settlement
agreement?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
--
i
don't
--
i
can't
answer
that
question.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
what
i
--
i
believe
that
it
would
allow
broad
powers
by
the
attorney
generals.
but
i
have
--
hasten
to
say,
as
i
did
at
the
beginning,
because
some
parties
entered
into
that
master
settlement
agreement
i
don't
think
changes
the
federal
--
the
congressional
intent
is
very
clear.
it
wanted
the
--
the
statement
--
congress
wanted
the
statements,
certain
statements,
on
cigarette
packages.
it
didn't
want
any
confusion
about
what
the
marketing
or
promotion
of
cigarettes
would
be.
i
can't
imagine,
justice
ginsburg,
a
clearer
statement.
it
says
no
requirement
or
prohibition
in
section
1334(b).
and
in
1331
it
says
"comprehensive
federal
programs
that
deal
with
cigarette
labeling
and
advertising
with
respect
to
any
relationship
between
smoking
and
health.
"
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
point--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
--
the
statute
deals
with
this
to
a
degree
in
section
1336
by
saving
certain
responsibilities.
but
i
think
the
more
powerful
answer
is
that
the
background
principle,
the
federal
trade
commission
act
and
federal
and
state
trade
--
fair
practices
act,
are
a
part
of
a
national
scheme
just
exactly
as
you
said.
it's
a
background--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
could
not
disagree
more,
justice
souter.
that's
the
general
background
scheme.
then
congress
specifically
addresses
smoking
and
health
in
the
advertising
of
cigarettes.
the
same--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
--
we
have
--
i'd
like
to
spend
no
time
on
the
implied
preemption
argument--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--because
i
think
--
i
think
this
is
the
--
the
--
that
congress
could
not
have
been
more
clear.
and
another
answer
to
your
question,
justice
souter,
is
the
airline
deregulation
act.
you
dealt
--
you
court
dealt
with
this
in
the
morales
case
and
the
wolens
case.
the
--
you
could
have
said
the
same
thing
there:
that
there
is
a
background
principle
against
unfair--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
--
i
think
that
it's
clear
that,
looking
at
the
briefs
in
that
case,
that
those
very
same
arguments
were
made.
the
same
argument
could
have
been
made
in
the
riegel
case
with
respect
to
devices.
the
general
principle
that
i'm
making
that
i
think
congress
understands,
and
this
court
has
clearly
understood,
is
that
there
is
a
background
principle
that
the
federal
government
is
not
pre-empting
deceptive
practice
regulations
except
when
congress
specifically
says
so.
now,
one
more
point
because
i
think
the
white
light
will
come
on:
the
united
states
government
did
not
address
in
this
case
the
express
pre-emption
argument.
but
a
few
years
ago,
in
the
reilly
case,
having
to
do
with
the
very
same
statute,
the
cigarette
labeling
act,
the
united
states
government
said
that
the
labeling
act
pre-empted
state
laws
concerning
the
content
of
cigarette
advertising,
the
content
of
cigarette
advertising.
that's
what
the
government
said
then
and
the
acting
solicitor
general
during
the
argument
in
that
case,
in
response
to
a
question
by
one
of
your
members
of
this
court,
specifically
said
the
--
the
statute
would
pre-empt
state
laws
about
filters
or
the
safety
of
a
particular
cigarette.
that
was
the
position
of
the
united
states
government
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
they
have
not
changed.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
haven't
given
up
the
implied
pre-emption
argument,
but
i
----
[laughter]
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
--
we
feel
that
we
explained
it
very
thoroughly
in
our
briefs,
and
i
thought
knowing
that
the
time
was
limited
i
thought
we
should
focus
on
the
strongest
argument
i
think
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
when
congress
has
spoken
directly.
now,
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
what
the
solicitor
general
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
says,
and
this
is
in
response
to
the
point
that
justice
scalia
was
just
addressing
--
page
1
of
the
reilly
brief,
the
attorney
general
is
responsible
for
enforcing
the
labeling
act.
so
it
is
the
government's
responsibility,
according
to
them,
to
enforce
the
labeling
act.
then
on
pages
8
and
9
of
their
brief,
distinguishing
between
the
location
of
the
billboards
in
that
case
and
other
things
that
would
be
pre-empted,
pages
8
and
9,
the
government
said
the
labeling
act
preempts
state
laws
concerning
the
content
of
cigarette
advertising
with
respect
to
smoking
and
health.
and
the
acting
solicitor
general
on
page
25
of
the
transcript
of
the
argument
that
day
in
this
case
was
asked
that
question,
what
is
pre-empted?
and
she
said
it
pre-empts
state
law
claims
about
filters
or
the
safety
of
a
particular
cigarette.
that
is
this
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
was
the
government's
point.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
has
to
do
according
to
what
congress
said
about
the
content
of
the
advertising
and
the
promotion
of
cigarettes;
that's
what
this
case
is
about
when
it
has
to
do
with
smoking
and
health.
now,
my
opponent
seems
to
run
away,
in
answer
to
your
question,
about
what
if
we
take
out
smoking
and
health
from
their
complaint?
well,
they
can't
take
out
smoking.
that
is
everywhere
in
the
complaint.
i
asked
the
court
to
sit
down
and
compare
the
labeling
statute
with
the
complaint.
and
the
words
are
indistinguishable,
and
they
say
over
and
over
again
and
on
page
4a
of
--
then
mr.
frederick's
saying
well,
all
they
want
is
economic
damages.
they
are
really
not
--
they
are
just
concerned
about
they
got
one
cigarette
and
they
wanted
to
get
another
cigarette.
page
4a,
this
is
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
understood
it.
this
is
page
4a
of
the
petition
appendix:
the
plaintiffs
explain
that
the
relative
levels
of
these
substances
bear
on
a
reasonable
consumer's
decision
on
which
cigarette
to
purchase,
because
consumers
understand
that
reducing
the
quantities
of
tar
and
nicotine
in
cigarettes
reduces
their
adverse
health
effects.
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
now,
i
will
just
conclude
in
this
way.
the
statute
in
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
reilly
case,
uses
"sweeping
language".
the
language
is
every
bit
as
sweeping
as
the
language
in
the
airline
deregulation
act
that
uses
the
phrase
relates
to,
i
submit.
so
there
is
three
requirements.
either
--
the
statute
prohibits,
any
and
it
uses
the
phrase
"any",
you
can't
get
more
expansive
than
that;
and
it
uses
the
word
"no"
requirements
or
prohibition.
the
court
has
dealt
with
requirements
and
prohibition
in
reilly,
cipollone,
bates,
wolens,
riegel.
the
statute
that
we
are
talking
about
here
in
this
case
is
the
same
statute
essentially
that
it
was
dealing
with
in
reilly.
it's
the
state
unfair
practices
act.
it
was
massachusetts/maine;
but
i
compared
the
statutes
side
by
side.
they
essentially
the
same.
is
the
requirement
based
upon
smoking
and
health?
well,
the
complaint
specifically
says
so.
the
relief
is
based
upon
the
relationship
between
smoking
and
health
and
is
it
in
promotion
or
advertising
of
tobacco?
again,
they've
said
that
over
and
over
again.
i
submit
that
the
statute
could
not
be
more
clear.
this
particular
complaint
seeks
to
impose
a
regulation--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
i
believe
it
does.
however,
justice
stevens,
i
believe
when
you
talked
about
in
that
--
the
plurality
opinion,
you
talked
about
minimizing,
reducing,
negating
the
effect
of
the
warning
labels.
that's
also
this
complaint.
this
as
a
complaint
is
identical
so
what
you
were
referring
to
on
page
527
of
cipollone.
