mr.
olson,
doesn't
your
answer
in
effect,
in
practical
terms,
exclude
the
possibility
of
inserts
like
that?
i
mean,
what
else
would
they
be
addressing
except
smoking
and
health?
that's
the
only
subject
on
the
table.
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
mr.
olson,
isn't
the
problem
that
congress
was
equally
clear,
or
has
at
least
been
assumed
to
be
equally
clear,
in
a
contrary
line
of
reasoning
that
holds
against
you?
and
that
line
of
reasoning
is
this:
you
agree
--
everybody
agrees
--
that
the
ftc
can
represent
--
it
can
regulate
advertising
and
--
and
supposed
deception
on
matters
that
do
affect
--
relate
to
smoking
and
health.
it
is
pretty
much
hornbook
law
at
this
stage
of
the
game
that
the
--
that
the
ftc's
regulation
of
deceptive
advertising
does
not
exclude
state
regulation
of
deceptive
advertising
as
a
general
proposition.
in
fact,
the
ftc
is
very
happy
to
have
complementary
state
regimes.
that
state
of
the
law
is
just
as
clear.
it
is
at
least
as
clear
as
you
say
the
language
is
here.
now,
given
the
fact
that
the
ftc
can
regulate
advertising
of
cigarettes
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
respect
that
matters
here,
why
don't
we
have
to
give
some
recognition
to
this
complementary
regime
of
state
regulation,
which,
as
a
general
proposition,
survives
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
all
i'm
saying
is
what
we
have
here
is,
you
say,
a
clear
preemption
provision.
but
we
also
have
a
clear
regulatory
regime
which
is
at
odds
with
that
preemption
provision,
and
presumably
we've
got
to
give
some
effect
to
that,
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
part
of
a
national
scheme,
but
in
practical
terms
you
can
say
that
on
any
subject
matter
that
the
ftc
regulates.
and,
nonetheless,
the
complementary
state
regimes
of
--
of
regulating
deception
survive.
so
that
the
argument
you
are
making
here
is
an
argument
that
can
be
made,
i
suppose,
on
every
subject
that
the
ftc
touches.
justice
david
h.
souter
perhaps
we
did
not
think
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
can
you
accept
that
and
then
expect
to
prove
damages
in
the
case?
you
can
accept
it
to
this
extent,
it
seems
to
me.
you
can
accept
it
in
saying
that
what
we
are
going
to
prove
at
step
number
one
is
that
it
is
false
to
indicate
that
smoking
light
cigarettes
will
result
in
the
ingestion
of
less
tar
and
nicotine;
and
we
know
why
you're
saying
that.
but
in
order
to
prove
damages
in
your
case,
you
would
have
to
say:
people
get
hurt
because
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
ingestion
of
tar
and
nicotine
and
their
health;
and
the
same
cause
--
the
same
causal
connection
is
therefore
appropriate
for
--
for
--
is
therefore
necessary
in
order
to
prove
that
people
were
hurt.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
asking
for
injunctive
relief,
i
guess.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
reason
--
and
the
reason
the
product
is
of
different
value
is
that
in
fact
it
is
dangerous
to
health,
as
opposed
to
--
or
more
dangerous
or
equally
dangerous
to
health
as
opposed
to
less
dangerous
to
health;
so
that
at
the
causation
stage
you've
still
got
to
prove
the
link
between
causation
and
health.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
you
could
recover
if
the
evidence
showed
simply
that
all
your
clients
had
the
health
of
olympic
athletes?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
the
harm
be,
sort
of
aesthetic?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
they
are
healthy
as
horses,
you
have
no
proof
that
it
is
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
what's
the
difference
in
value?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
would
the
person
have
decided
to
quit
or
not
to
quit?
the
person
would
have
made
that
decision
based
upon
the
health
consequences.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
--
you
are
proving
a
point
which
depends
upon
the
relationship
between
smoking
and
health.
