justice
antonin
scalia
your
implied
--
your
implied
preemption
argument
would
certainly
fall
prey
to
that
--
to
that
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
good
idea.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
if
yugos
and
fords
are
worth
the
same
amount
of
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
the
thing
here.
unless
you
show
that
for
some
--
for
some
reason
--
were
light
cigarettes
sold
as
a
premium?
did
they
charge
more
for
light
cigarettes?
justice
antonin
scalia
answer
my
question.
did
they
charge
more
for
light
cigarettes?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me
before
you
go.
i
don't
understand
that.
it
is
not
specially
targeted
at
cigarettes
and
at
the
harmful
health
effects
of
cigarettes?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
general
statute
but
in
riegel
we
--
we
took
a
general
statute
and
looked
at
what
its
specific
application
in
the
case
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
get
away
with
just
coming
in
and
saying
the
general
statute
is
an
anti-deception
statute.
didn't
we
look
at
what
the
application
of
it
was
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
petitioner
says
you
have
in
an
earlier
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
commission
--
when
did
the
commission
know
of
this
stuff?
i
had
a
case
when
i
was
on
the
court
of
appeals,
so
it
had
to
be
before
1984
involving
so-called
lip
drape--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
which
the
smoker
covers
up
the
little
holes
that
bring
in
some
fresh
air.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
been
general
knowledge
for
a
long
time,
and
the
ftc
has
done
nothing
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
a
question?
i
plan
to
go
back
and
see
what
the
government
said
in
the
--
in
the
case
that
petitioner
asserts
you
have
effectively
supported
his
position
on
--
on
express
pre-emption.
i
plan
to
go
back
and
read
it.
assuming
i
agree
with
him
rather
than
you,
has
the
government's
position
changed
from
what
it
was
then?
as
far
as
you
know,
is
the
government's
position
still
the
same,
the
position
that
you
delicately
did
not
bring
to
our
attention?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
in
reilly.
i
haven't
read
the
brief
there,
i
must
say.
but
suppose
i
agree
with
petitioner.
can
i
assume--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
do
you
assume
that
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
i'm
not
asking
about
--
i'll
figure
that
out
on
my
own.
trust
me.
i
can
probably
figure
that
out.
but
once
i
have
figured
it
out,
can
i
assume
that
that
is
still
the
government's
position--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whatever
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
no
idea
which
direction
that
would
lead?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
going
to
hold
you
to
your
last
position,
just
--
just
for
fun.
