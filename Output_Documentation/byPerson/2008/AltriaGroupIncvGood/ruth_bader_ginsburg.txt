is
it
a
question
of
just
how
you
phrase
it,
mr.
olson?
is
there
any
scope
--
does
your
argument
leave
any
scope
for
attorney
general,
state
attorney
general
imposition
of
state
law
remedies
against
a
deceptive
practice
involving
advertising
cigarettes.
to
give
you
concrete
examples,
suppose
a
state
attorney
general
said
in
every
--
suppose
the
practice
were
in
every
carton
of
cigarettes
the
cigarette
manufacturer
includes
an
insert
that
says:
if
you
want
to
ingest
less
nicotine,
buy
our
cigarettes;
if
you
want
to
ingest
less
nicotine,
buy
our
cigarettes.
and
the
state
attorney
general
goes
after
that
statement
in
the
carton
as
false
and
deceptive
advertising.
would
there
be
any
scope
for
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
answer
then
to
my
specific
example
would
be
the
attorney
general
could
not
go
after
such
a
statement,
"if
you
want
to
ingest
less
nicotine,
buy
our
cigarettes?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
the
jury
fracture?
you
said
the
attorney
general
could
not
stop,
my
example,
"if
you
want
to
ingest
less
nicotine,
buy
our
lights.
"
the
attorney
general
could
not
proscribe
that.
so
nothing
that
you're
saying
turns
on
it
being
the
jury
rather
than
the
attorney
general,
does
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
position
is
essentially
that
congress,
as
--
as
far
as
the
advertising
of
low
or
light,
congress
empowered
one
decisionmaker
only
and
that's
the
ftc,
and
if
they
don't
act
then
the
cigarette
companies
can
say
anything
they
want
about
low
tar
and
low
nicotine?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
--
does
the
consent
decree
say
anything
about
advertising
low,
light,
those
specifics?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
are
you
saying
that
the
consent
decree
--
because
we
have
overtaken
judge
kessler's
decision
by
consent
decree,
right
and
it
has
terms?
does
a
--
does
a
consent
decree
terms
allow
state
attorney
generals
to
say
don't
advertise
low?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
a
state
attorney
general
say
under
my
authority
to
check
against
false
and
deceptive
advertising,
no
cigarette
company
can
advertise
in
this
state
low
or
light?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
he
wins
the
lawsuit
--
he
wins
the
lawsuit
that
it's
false
and
deceptive
to
say
"low".
could
he
then
have
a
regulation
that
says
cigarette
companies
don't
advertise
"low"
or
"light"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
can
you
make
that
concrete?
what
would
change
about
the
label
"low"
or
"light"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
in
the
reilly
case.
