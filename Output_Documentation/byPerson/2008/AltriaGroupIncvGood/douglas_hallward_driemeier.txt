mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--your
honor,
the
united
states
did
not
participate
on
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
express
pre-emption
provision
in
cipollone,
and
to
a
large
extent
the
express
pre-emption
question
in
this
case
is
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
decision
in
cipollone.
and
so
that
is
of
less
interest
to
the
united
states
than
certainly
the
second
question
presented,
which
has
to
do
with
the
ftc's
own
authority
and
its
exercise
of
that
authority.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
your
honor,
the
united
states
has
not
taken
a
position
on
the
bottom
line
of
the
first
question
presented.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
i
don't
believe
that
the
position
that
the
united
states
stated
in
reilly
is
dispositive
of
the
first
question
presented
in
this
case.
but,
again,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
brief
that
the
united
states
has
filed
with
respect
to
implied
pre-emption
is
not
relevant.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--but
we--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i
would
hope
so.
thank
you.
but
we
also
address
a
question
that
is
common
to
the
two
questions
presented,
and
that
is
an
argument
that
the
petitioners
make
with
respect
to
implied
pre-emption,
but
they
also
make
it
with
respect
to
express
pre-emption,
and
that
is
--
and,
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
as
your
honor
is
aware,
we
submitted
a
--
a
supplemental
authority
letter
that
in
july
of
this
year
the
commission
issued
a
request
for
comment
on
a
proposal
to
rescind
its
guidance
with
respect
to
the
tar
and
nicotine
test
results,
precisely
because
of
concern
that
they
are
misleading
due
to
the
evidence
that
has
developed
about
the
incidence
of
compensation.
that
was
not
believed
at
the
time
that
the
commission
issued
its
guidance
back
in
1966
and
'67
to
present
a
significant
problem.
but
it
is
evident
now.
the
scientific
community
indicates
and
certainly
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
rico
case
are
that
the
--
that
the
tobacco
companies
have
known
since
1967
that
in
fact
compensation
is
nearly
complete,
and
for
that
reason,
the
tar
and
nicotine
yields
via
the
cambridge
test
method
are
not
indicative
of
the
yield
to
a
true
human
smoker.
and
for
that
reason,
it
proposed
to
withdraw.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
with
respect
to
the
--
i
want
first
to
take
issue
with
the
question
of
fda
context,
to
riegel
and
the
like,
and
that
is
not
the
nature
of
what
the
federal
trade
commission
does.
it
doesn't
stand--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--we
proposed
a
rule
to
require
the
disclosure
of
tar
and
nicotine--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
no.
the
consent
decrees
did
not
require
them
to
put
the
information
in
their
ads.
it
said
that
it
would
be
deceptive
to
make
claims
about
the
tar
and
nicotine
content
of
the
cigarettes
without
expressing,
in
milligrams,
what
the
yield
was
per
the
cambridge
test
method.
but
that's
a
very
different
thing.
it's
a
prohibition.
they
were
ordered
to
cease
and
desist
making
claims
about
tar
and
nicotine
content
without
giving
the
consumer
the
benefit
of
the
yield
figures.
but
the
commission
has
never
--
specifically
at
issue
in
this
case
are
the
descriptors
"light"
or
"lower
in
tar".
in
1997,
the
commission
issued
a
notice
in
which
it
said
these
terms
are
are
not
defined
by
federal
law.
they
asked
whether
there
should
be--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--yes,
your
honor,
because
the
--
the
"light",
on
its
own,
much
more
conveys
the
impression
to
the
consumer
that
this
is
the
yield
to
the
consumer
himself,
the
actual
human
smoker,
and
in
fact
that
was
why
the--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--they
--
whether
they
are
or
are
not
misleading
depends
upon
the
incidence
of
compensation.
at
the
time
the
commission
issued
its
guidance
in
1966
and
'67,
the
hew
report
was
that
compensation
was
not
expected
to
be
a
problem.
it
was
not
believed
to
be
a
problem.
beginning
in
1983,
when
in
light
of
the
barclay's
case
in
which
it
was
determined
that
a
particular
cigarette,
the
yield
according
to
the
test
method
had
nothing
to
do
with
yield
to
an
actual
consumer,
the
ftc
started
to
inquire
about
this.
but
the
petitioners,
although
they
have
known
since
1967
about
the
incidence
of
compensation,
failed
to
disclose
that
information
to
the
commission.
they
have
failed
to
--
they
have
refused
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
their
insights,
their
own
studies.
the
commission
has
asked--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--you're
right.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
in
1978--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--there
has
been
a
question.
in
1978,
the
commission
issued
a
notice
requesting
comment
about
whether
lip
drape
in
fact
occluded
the
holes
that
dilute
the
concentration
of
the
air,
and
the
tobacco
companies
did
not
respond
to
that,
even
though
they
had
their
own
studies
showing
that
it
was
a
problem.
so
it
is
--
it
is
true
that
the
commission
has
only
now
issued
the
notice
proposing
to
withdraw
its
earlier
guidance;
but
the
petitioners
themselves
should
not
be
able
to
benefit
from
their
own
misleading
of
the
commission.
but
again,
i
think
it's
more
fundamental
than
that,
is
that
their
arguments
rely
upon
a
misconception
of
what
the
commission
does.
as
justice
souter
noted,
it
is
hornbook
law
the
commission
does
not
supplant
state
law;
it
acts
cooperatively
with
state
law.
the
commission
does
not
act
as
a
gatekeeper
like
fda
in
approving
things.
it
acts
as
a
law
enforcement
agency.
it
goes
after
fraud
when
it
is
aware
of
it.
but
that
is
not
to
the
exclusion
of
state
law
enforcement
agencies
or
other
federal
law
enforcement
agencies.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
the
reilly
case.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
of
course--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--the
position
of
the
united
states
as
stated
in
the
reilly
case
was
that
the
express
guarantee
provision
did
not
pre-empt
a
regulation
of
the
nature
in
that
case.
it
was
our
position
that
that,
because
it
was--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
i--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
i
would
think
that
we
would
need
to
revisit
the
question
in
light
of
this
court's
holding
in
reilly,
in
light
of
the
additional
precedents
that
there
have
been
over
the
last
decade
or
whatever
it's
been
since
that
decision
was
issued.
so--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--we
have
not
taken
a
position
on
the
first
--
on
the
bottom
line
of
the
first
question
presented.
although
as
i
say--
