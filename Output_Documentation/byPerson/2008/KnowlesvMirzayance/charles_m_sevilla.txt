mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
socalled
v.
waldron,
which
--
it
does
not
say
that
in
profitt
v.
waldron.
it's
a
fiction
attributed
to
the
ninth
circuit,
because
the
ninth
circuit
not
only
did
not
say
that;
they
rejected
the
idea
that
they
were
relying
on
a
"nothing
to
lose"
rule.
the
ninth
circuit
applied
--
well,
i
might
also
add
that
in
a
case
called
lowery
v.
lewis,
which
is
cited
at
the
petitioner's
appendix
to
the
cert
94,
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
and
in
no
uncertain
terms
said
it
rejected
a
"nothing
to
lose"
rule.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
it
--
essentially,
because
it's
an
irrelevant
concern
because
the
decision
has
to
be
made
on
whether
counsel's
decision,
as
he
faced
the
trial
facts,
was
objectively
reasonable.
now,
in
that
calculus
if
there's
nothing
to
lose
by
going
forward,
if
there's
a
great
benefit
to
achieve
by
going
forward,
if
he's
got
a
credible
defense,
as
it
was
determined
by
the
district
court
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
on
insanity,
then
it's
objectively
unreasonable
on
the
morning
of
trial
on
the
way
to
court,
to
--
out
of
a
sense
of
despair
or
hopelessness,
subjectively
speaking,
to
decide
that
i'm
going
to
jettison
this
defense
that's
been
prepared
over
the
year.
there
was--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--i'm
saying
that's
one
of
the
factors.
i'm
not
saying
that's
the
sole
factor
because,
as
the
case
that
i
cited,
lowery,
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress
which
attorneys
were
making
in
this
case.
they
all
lost,
and
the
client
in
that
case
argued,
well,
there
was
nothing
to
lose
in
presenting
this
motion
to
suppress,
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
that's
not
the
rule;
it's
under
the
circumstances
whether
the
performance
is
objectively
unreasonable,
so
we
need
to
take
into
consideration
the
competing
factors.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
correct.
and
in
--
in
that
regard,
the
state
has
argued--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--it
would
be
one
step
removed
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
there
was
an
evidentiary
hearing
which
resolved
facts
that
should
have
been
resolved
in
the
state
court.
appellant
filed
a
separate
petition
in
the
court
of
appeal
of
california,
filed
the
same
petition
in
the
california
supreme
court,
asked
--
first
argued
up
front
that
this
was
unreasonable
performance
under
strickland,
and
then
said
if
the
court
disagrees,
then
it
ought
to
be
remanded
to
a
referee
for
fact
development.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
and
holds
it.
but--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--well,
there's
a
hole
in
the
statute,
there's
no
question
about
it,
under
2254(d)(1).
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
when
you
have
the
--
the
statute
requiring
the
application
of
--
or
nonapplication
of
law
contrary
to
the
united
states
supreme
court--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--or
an
unreasonable
application
thereof,
what
happens
when
--
that
issue
really
cannot
be
decided
without
an
evidentiary
hearing
under
strickland.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
we
argued
that
because
mr.
wager,
defense
counsel,
presented
a
declaration
which
was
contradicted
by
other
declarations
as
to
the
reason
he
gave
up
this
defense
--
we
argued
it
was
objectively
unreasonable
if
the
court
--
the
state
court
took
all
of
the
intendments
in
favor
of
our
declaration,
and
mr.
wager
did
not
really
address
the
reasons
for
giving
up
the
defense,
he
just
said,
i
felt
it
was
hopeless.
it
took
the
evidentiary
hearing
to
determine
why
he
felt
it
was
hopeless.
so
we
argued
that
on
the
face
of
it,
it
is
strickland
error.
if
the
court
disagrees,
then
we're
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
determine--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--what
we
specified
is
why
his
rationale
was
unreasonable,
and
we--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--right.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
we
argued
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
no.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
was
that
bell
v.
kelly?
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
i
think
it
was,
and
the
court
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted,
and--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--that's
california
law.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
that
is--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--in
order
to
deny
relief,
one
has
to
--
the
court
has
to
presume
the
adequacy
of
the
showing
or
the
truth
of
the
showing
made
by
the--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--no.
we're
not
making
any
claim
that
there
has
to
be
a
hearing
in
every
federal
case
when
there
is
an
argument
that
could
be
deemed
on
--
based
on
cumulative
evidence.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
i--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--well,
it's
--
it
also
is
california
law,
and
i
believe
it
is
habeas
corpus
law,
that
when
the
petitioner
files
a
petition
and
attaches
declarations,
in
order
to
deny
those,
assuming
that
the
truth
of
those
declarations
is
presumed
in
order
to
evaluate
the
prima
facie
case
--
for
example,
in
this
case,
in
strickland
--
that
if
that
can't
be
resolved
without
a
hearing,
a
hearing
should
be
held.
and
--
and
the
court
of
appeal
on
the
first
go-around
held
exactly
that.
the
court
said
there
are
competing
reasons
here
why
the
defense
counsel
waived
this
defense
on
the
morning--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--well,
there
are
a
couple
of
problems
with
--
all
of
that
is
true.
i
might
quibble
with
one,
but
what
--
mr.
wager
was
operating
under
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
california
law.
all
of
that
was
ready-to-go
to
present.
he
had
a
great
not
--
guilty-by-reason-of-insanity
case
supported
by
lay
--
lay
testimony,
childhood
history,
and
--
and
these
psychiatric
opinions
of
very
formidable
experts.
but
he
had
a
fundamental
error
that
was
only
revealed
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
understanding
of
california
law.
he
said
--
and
he
said
this
six
times
at
the
evidentiary
hearing.
he
said
that
when
a
jury
has
found
the
defendant
has
maturely
and
meaningfully
deliberated,
that
that
means
they
found
the
equivalent
of
wrongfulness.
that
is
absolutely
wrong.
he
was
quoting
from
a
statute
that
was
repealed
in
1982,
when
california
had
a
major
revision
of
its
statutes
and
moved
mental
health
concepts--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--surely
it
enters
into
the
consideration,
and
every
one
of
the
experts
considered
precisely
that
evidence,
which
was
for
the
most
part
after-the-fact
evidence.
and
as
the
state's
doctor
--
and,
again,
this
came
out
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
because
it's
certainly
not
discovered
in
--
in
the
state
doctor's
report
that
was
submitted.
the
state
doctor,
dr.
anderson,
stated
at
the
trial
in
federal
court
that,
yes,
he
was
aware
of
the
consciousness-of-guilt
evidence
that
came
about
mostly
after
the
event,
but
that
did
not
speak
to
his
intent,
his
mental
state
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
and
he
stated,
which
was
a
great
surprise
in
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing,
that
he
believed
mr.
mirzayance
was,
because
of
the
psychosis,
feeling
that
he
was
justified--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--it
was
a
thorough
investigation.
but
this
case
--
this
court
has
said,
in
terry
williams,
counsel
has
a
duty
to
investigate
and
proffer
mitigation
evidence
in
a
--
in
a
capital
case.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
he
had
an
obligation
to
proffer
it
because
he
was
operating
on
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
california
law.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
i
--
i
will
--
i
could
rattle
off
page
numbers
from
where
he
said
that
the
jury
finding
of
premeditation
and
deliberation
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
finding
of
sanity.
that
is
absolutely
not
true.
here's
the
quote.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
he
did
not
say
"the
functional
equivalent".
he
said
words
like--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--yes.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
that
--
that's
a
challenge
that
faces
every
criminal
defense
attorney
in
a
case
when
you
have
a
--
a
credible
defense
like
this.
there
--
there
are
going
to
be
challenges
to
that
by
vigorous,
trained
prosecutors.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
if
there
had
been
a
tactical
purpose
such
as
that,
that
would
have
been
an
interesting
fact
to
add
to
the
calculus
here,
but
he
absolutely
denied
there
was
any
benefit
to
his
client.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
it
--
it
may
well
be
if
there
was
a--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--if
there
was
a
possibility
that
there
could
be
any
difference
whatsoever
at
sentencing.
but
he
testified,
well,
what
was
going
to
happen
to
mr.
mirzayance
if
he
entered
this
plea.
he
was
going
to
get
25
or
29
to
life,
which
is
exactly
what
happened.
so
there
was
no--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--how
did
he
know
that?
because
it's
--
if
you
--
he
had
already
been
convicted
of
firstdegree
murder
with
the
use
of
a
gun.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
correct,
but
under
california
law
there
--
it's
a
mandatory
prison
sentence
for
use
of
a
gun,
so
--
and
the
sentence
for
first-degree
murder
is
25
to
life.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
correct.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
no,
no.
it's
a
minimum
mandatory
25
to
life.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
no.
he
--
he
could
give
25
--
the
--
the--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--correct.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
correct.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
correct.
and
mr.
--
the
defense
counsel
said
as
much
when
answering
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
any
possible
benefit.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
he's
got
nothing
to
lose
and
something
to
gain.
there
was
no
benefit
in
taking
the
--
the
action
that
he
took
in
waiving
this
defense,
which
was
credible.
he
was
prepared
to
present
it
until
the
morning--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--there
is
no
case
that
this
court
has
so
pronounced.
we're
not
arguing
for
that
standard,
nor
should
we
have
to--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--well,
they're
all
part
of
the
calculus
of
reasonable
performance.
certainly,
the
fact
that
there's
nothing
to
lose,
that
he
is
going
to
get
an
automatic
25-year
minimum
sentence,
that
he's
--
on
the
other
hand,
he's
got
a
credible
defense
for
which
there
is
absolutely
no
benefit
in
giving
up,
if
--
and
--
and
then
he
decides
for
reasons
of
error--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--well,
the
--
this
court
has
said
that
errors
of
misunderstanding
--
well,
the
court
has
said
that
failure
to
fact-investigate
can
be
a
basis
for
objectively
unreasonable
performance.
the
same
is
true
with
failure
to
legally
investigate
what's
the
law
governing
your
case.
and
he
stated
on
six
occasions
that
the
fact
that
the
jury,
quote,
had
already
found
mirzayance
guilty
of
first-degree
murder,
and,
whether
they
knew
it
or
not,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
legally
sane,
well,
then
the
question
is,
well,
how
do
you
make
that
determination?
and
by
the
way,
he
said
the
equivalent
of
that
six
times
during
the
hearing.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well
--
well,
i
--
that
might
be
the
case
if
he
did
not
misunderstand
california
law.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
the
circuit
in--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--that's
correct,
because
the
magistrate
did
really
not
make
a
finding
on
prong
one.
the
--
the
magistrate
misapprehended
the
intention
of
the
circuit's
first
remand
by
thinking
that
it
had
mandated
a
nothing-to-lose
rule.
and
if
there
was
nothing
to
lose,
it
was
prong
one
ineffectiveness,
so
there
was
no
need
to
make
a
finding.
so
we're
left
without
a
finding.
but
the
circuit,
on
--
on
its
second
and
third
opinion,
noted
that
his
concept
of
premeditation
and
deliberation
as
having
mental
health
concepts
was
wrong
because
of
the
1982
amendment
to
the
statutes
which
removed
many
of
the
mental
health
concepts
and
--
and
put
them
over
into
the
insanity
phase.
and
so
when
he
said
to
the
court
at
the
hearing,
mr.
mirzayance
--
after
the
jury
found
he
maturely
and
meaningfully
deliberated,
that's
language
that
was
eliminated
in
--
in
1982,
and
that
is
the
mental-health
concept.
and
--
and
this
point
is
very
important
to
this
argument.
when
he
was
arguing
to
the
jury,
he
said
he
can't
premeditate
and
deliberate
because
he's
mentally
ill.
he's
mentally
diseased.
and
he
was
cut
off
by
the
prosecutor
and
the
court
who
gave
an
instruction
--
it's
at
853
of
the
trial
transcript
--
saying
the
fact
that
mr.
mirzayance
may
have
deliberated
for
irrational
reasons
brought
on
by
mental
disease
is
not
a
defense
to
this
case.
his
reasons
can
be
irrational
in
deliberating.
and
that
should
have
tipped
him
off
that
this
jury
was
precluded
from
taking
the
psychiatric
testimony
--
the
psychological
testimony
of
the
one
witness
at
the
guilt
phase
and
--
and
deeming
that
a
negation
of
any
ability
to
win
on
a
wrongfulness
standard.
and
--
and
i
might
also
add--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--he
did.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
they
did
consider
what
he
said,
but
they
were
precluded
from
channeling
that
into
a
defense
to
premeditation
and
deliberation.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
and
--
and
you
were
reading
from
the
california
court
of--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--well,
the
california
court
of
appeal
did
not
have
before
them
the
evidence
that
came
in
by
way
of
petition,
which
was
all
of
the
psychiatric
opinions
of
the
forensic
psychiatrists
who
gave
declarations
saying
that
mr.
mirzayance
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
homicide.
that
is
not
within
the
court
of
appeal
opinion
because
the
court
of
appeal
opinion
is
on
the
four
corners
of
the
record,
and
this
was
collateral
to
that.
so
any
statement
along
those
lines
did
not
encompass
the
most
powerful
evidence
that
was
presented,
which
would
have
been
all
of
the
psychiatric
opinion
testimony
about
his
mental
state
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
and
--
and
then,
of
course,
we
know
that
at
--
at
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing,
this
defense
was
found
credible,
and
one
of
the
state
doctors
came
over
to
the
defense
side
and
--
and
testified
that
mirzayance
did
not
understand
wrongfulness
at
the
time
of
the
homicide
because
of
the
psychosis.
and
this
doctor
made
an
error,
and
it's
--
it's
clear
from
the
record
at
the
evidentiary
hearing,
he
had
an
error
in
his
understanding
of
the
ngi
test
in
california.
he
thought
if
you
met
prong
one,
you
understood
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
act,
you
were
sane,
and
he
never
went
to
wrongfulness.
but
when
he
was
asked
by
the
state
at
this
hearing,
well,
what
about
his
ability
to
understand
wrongfulness,
and
the
doctor
said,
well,
he
didn't
understand
wrongfulness.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
in
california
in
1982,
there
was
a
statutory
amendment
which
prohibited
forensic
experts
from
testifying
to
opinions
at
the
guilt
phase,
so
that
--
on
legal
issues
like
premeditation
and
deliberation.
so
they
could
not,
dr.
satz
could
not
testify
at
the
guilt
phase
on
premeditation
and
deliberation.
at
the
insanity
phase,
they
absolutely
can
testify
as
to
whether
he
was
sane
or
not.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
no.
he
testified
this
was
his
first
ngi
defense.
speaking
to
--
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
you
raised
the
issue
about
couldn't
these
--
in
the
prejudice
calculus,
couldn't
the
psychiatrists
have
been
impeached
with
the
fact
that
they
found
no
premeditation
and
deliberation?
well,
california
statute
under
penal
code
section
28
prohibits
their
opinion
on
premeditation
and
deliberation
at
the
guilt
phase
where
the
issue
is
premeditation
and
deliberation.
so
i
can't
understand
how
a
court
would
let
in
their
opinions
on
premeditation
and
deliberation
when
there's
a
totally
separate
issue
of
insanity
at
the
insanity
phase.
it's
--
if
it's
irrelevant
or
prohibited
at
the
guilt
phase
where
premeditation
is
the
issue,
it's
surely
going
to
be
irrelevant
at
the
ngi
phase
where
it's
not
an
issue,
and
we
have
a
totally
different
standard.
as
--
as
the
courts
of
california
have
said,
one
can
be
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
and
be
insane.
that
--
that's
clear.
so,
in
this
case,
we
have
an
attorney
who,
for
whatever
reasons
based
on
a
subjective
sense
of
hopelessness,
gave
up
his
client's
only
and
best
defense,
a
defense
that
was
found
credible
at
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing.
once
--
once
that
defense
is
found
credible,
that
bespeaks
of
the
unreasonableness
of
counsel
giving
it
up.
it's
a
credible
defense.
it's
the
only
defense
available
to
him,
and
counsel
gave
it
up
for
no
tactical
benefit.
there
was
no
upside
to
this.
there
was
a
clear
downside
to
it,
because
it
consigned
his
client
to
29
years
to
life
as
opposed
to
the
possibility
of
treatment
in
a
mental
hospital
and
--
and,
potentially,
upon
the
restoration
of
sanity,
potential
relief
--
release
if
he
could
prove
his
restoration.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
yes,
he
has.
he's
in
mule
creek
state
prison
just
south
of
stockton,
california,
and--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
--i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
believe
--
i
think
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
the
trial
judge
did
not
do
anything
special
except
sentence
him
to
prison?
although
both
--
in
terms
of
the
bona
fides
of
his
disease,
both
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
said
he
was
clearly
a
mentally
diseased
person.
so
that
--
this
--
this
bespeaks
back
to
the
credibility
of
the
defense
which
was
established
by
the
mental
disease
evidence
which
stemmed
from
childhood.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
thank
you
very
much.
