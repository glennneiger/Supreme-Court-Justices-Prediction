how
about
getting
another
jury?
that
was
--
one
of
the
reasons
that
counsel
gave
why
he,
counsel,
was
withdrawing
the
ngi
plea
was
the
jury
just
found
--
rejected
the
second-degree
murder
charge
and
found
he
had
acted
deliberately
with
premeditation.
but
couldn't
--
because
the
--
the
first
jury
had
so
come
in
at
the
guilt
phase,
couldn't
the
attorney
have
requested
a
brand
new
jury
to
hear
the
ngi
plea?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
should
treat
the
district
court
proceeding
as
though
it
had
never
happened
on
the
ground
that
the
ninth
circuit
never
should
have
remanded
it
to
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
we
just
take
it
as
though
we
had
a
2254
petition
from
the
state
supreme
court
in
the
district
court.
and
then
the
district
court
doesn't
conduct
any
hearing;
it
just
applies
the
aedpa
standard.
so
the
--
the
whole
thing
about
clearly
erroneous
in
the
district
court,
that
--
that
should
be
out
of
the
--
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
there
something
on
the
other
side?
you
seem
to
present
this
as
a
case
where
counsel
did
a
careful
job,
and
then
he
lost
faith.
he
lost
hope,
and
so
he
acted
irrationally.
but
wasn't
there
on
the
other
side
consideration
of
the
sentence
that
he
was
going
to
get,
and
might
not
a
lawyer
perfectly
rationally
think,
if
i
give
up
this
defense,
it's
just
going
to
waste
everybody's
time?
the
judge
is
going
to
give
me
the
benefit
of
--
of
having
done
that
in
the
sentence,
in
giving
a
lower
sentence,
in
giving
--
making
the
sentences
on
the
multiple
offenses
concurrent
rather
than
consecutive.
justice
ruth

had
wager
ever
represented
a
defendant
who
pled
ngi?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
the
special
--
he
made
a
request
for
a
particular
prison.
is
that
the
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there
also
something
about
the
revocations?
there
were
three
revocations
involved,
i
thought,
and
he
got
2
years
on
each.
