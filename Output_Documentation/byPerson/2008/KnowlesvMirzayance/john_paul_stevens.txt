justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
supposing
we
were
convinced
--
and
i'm
not
suggesting
we
should
be
on
the
record.
but
supposing
we
were
convinced
that
only
the
dumbest,
untrained
lawyer
in
the
world
could
have
failed
to
advance
this
defense,
and
that
therefore
i
would
have
no
doubt
about
it
as
an
original
proposition
that
he
was
incompetent
under
strickland
--
under
the
general
strickland
standard.
would
we
be
permitted
to
say
that
in
the
case,
or
would
we
have
to
say,
well,
this
particular
kind
of
attorney
error
has
never
been
addressed
before,
and
therefore,
we
can't
look
at
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
--
but
isn't
it
true
that
there's
a
whole
host
of
counsel
errors
that
could
violate
strickland?
but
do
you
have
to
find
one
that
we
have
addressed
before
before
a
federal
court
can
apply
it
and
say
strickland
was
violated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
--
wouldn't
it
be
a
clear
answer
in
this
case
to
say
this
was
a
terrible
lawyer,
and
therefore
strickland
--
strickland
applies?
or
do
you
have
--
or
could
you
say,
we
don't
care
how
--
how
bad
the
lawyer
was,
strickland
--
we
haven't
adjudicated
this
precise
set
of
facts
before,
so
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
what
you're
asking
us
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
his
argument,
not
the
one
you've
been
making.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you
say
the
standard
is
strickland.
