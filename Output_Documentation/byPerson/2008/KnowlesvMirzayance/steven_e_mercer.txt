mr.
steven
e.
mercer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
deferential
review
required
by
the
aedpa,
mr.
mirzayance
was
not
entitled
to
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
on
his
ineffective
counsel
claim
because
the
state
court
adjudication
of
that
claim
was
not
contrary
to,
nor
an
unreasonable
application
of,
the
clearly
established
strickland
test.
and
because
the
strickland
rule
is
a
general
one,
the
california
supreme
court
had
wide
latitude
in
resolving
that
claim.
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
applied
something
different
from
strickland,
finding
that
wager
was
duty-bound
to
present
a
state
law
affirmative
defense
because
no
other
defenses
were
said
to
be
available
at
that
time
and
because
it
merely
might
have
worked.
but
even
the
ninth
circuit
conceded
that
this
court
has
never
announced
such
a
test.
and
as
in--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--well,
i
think
it
depends
on
whether
the
federal
habeas
court
is
doing
a
section
2254(d)
analysis.
the
fact
is
that
section
2254(d),
for
example,
doesn't
speak
to
denying
a
claim
on
the
merits,
even
if
it's
unexhausted.
so,
in
theory,
a
federal
habeas
court
could
perhaps
accept
new
evidence
that
the
state
court
never
had
before
it
in
order
to
deny
relief.
but
we
cannot
envision
a
situation
where
it
would
ever
be
efficacious
to
hold
a
hearing
in
light
of--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--excuse
me--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--well,
there
shouldn't
be
a
difference.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
well,
i
would
say
that
in
virtually
every
case
it,
in
fact,
is
a
meaningless
distraction
from
what
the
state
court
did
based
on
the
record
presented
it,
and
here's
why.
because
if
the
state
court
made
a
reasonable
adjudication
of
the
merits
of
the
claim
based
on
the
state
court
record,
then
even
holding
a
hearing
wouldn't
make
any
difference
because
relief
would
still
be
precluded
under
2254(d).
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
well,
i
think,
again,
the
only
question
that
matters
is
the
2254(d)
question
that
says
that
relief
shall
not
be
granted
unless
that
state
court
adjudication,
based
on
the
state
court
record
presented,
was
unreasonable,
and
here's
why.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
perhaps,
and
--
and
under
extremely
rare
cases
that
may--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--well,
i
agree,
justice
scalia,
and
this
court
said
in
holland
v.
jackson
that
the
pertinent
question
is
what
the
state
court
had
in
front
of
it.
and
the
reason
here
is
simple:
that
it
is
unfair
to
find
that
the
state
courts
made
an
unreasonable
application
of
law
based
on
facts
that
they
didn't
have.
so--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
mirzayance
raised--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--i
don't
think
so.
we
--
we
disagreed
that
there
should
have
been
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
first
place,
and
we
argued
that
below.
it's
our
position
that
there
should
not
have
been
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
first
place.
it's
our
position
that,
frankly,
this
was
a
straightforward,
routine
strickland
case
that
was
uncomplicated,
properly
adjudicated
by
the
district
court
when
they
first
reached
it
in
2001
without
a
hearing,
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
come
at
this
matter
with
a
--
a
chest
full
of
monkey
wrenches
in
the
sense
that
they
should
not
have
ordered
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
first
place,
and
then
when
they
did,
they
should
not
have
disregarded
the
very
fact-finding
that
they
ordered
be
done.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
yes.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
well,
i
don't
think
it
changed
the
standard
because
2254
simply
requires
an
adjudication
on
the
merits,
and
we
have
that
here.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
yes,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
yes.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
and
i
think--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--i
think
that
question
is
unclear,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
this
court
did
recently
say
in
landrigan
that
the
decision
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
remains
with
the
sound
discretion
of
the
district
court,
but
in
the
same
sentence
said
that
that
discretion
was
circumscribed
by
the
aedpa.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
well,
if
a
petitioner
or
a
state
prisoner
was
somehow
precluded
from
developing
facts
in
the
state
court
and
should
have
had
an
evidentiary
hearing
under
this
court's
clearly
established
law,
then
that
would
be
the
correct
solution.
here,
however,
we
have
a
fully
developed
state
court
record.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
that's
correct.
the
point
here
under
the
aedpa
--
and
i
think
it's
congress'
clear
intent
--
is
that
all
of
these
claims
are
to
be
funneled
through
the
state
courts
first.
and
congress
has
entrusted
the
state
courts
to
be
the
primary
and
first
interpreters
and
enforcers
of
federal
constitutional
law
for
state
prisoners'
claims.
and
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
including
in
sawyer
v.
smith,
they're
co-equals
to
the
federal
courts
in
doing
so.
so
what
should
have
happened
in
this
case
we
contend
is
what
the
district
court
first
did
when
confronted
with
the
claim
in
2001.
and
that
is
you
assess
the
facts
and
claims
as
presented
to
the
state
court
and
then
decide
whether
it
would
be
reasonable
to
reject
the
claim
under
either
prong
of
strickland.
and
as
this
court
said
in
strickland
itself,
the
easiest
and
most
direct
way
to
answer
that
question
is
through
the
prejudice
prong
here.
we
have
to
remember
the
reality
of
this
case
that
for
an
affirmative
defense
of
insanity,
or
ngi
under
california
law,
attorney
wager
bore
the
burden
of
proving
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
his
client
did
not
know
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
when
he
committed
this
crime.
and
every
bit
of
mirzayance's
own
deeds
and
words
show
that
he
did.
before
the
killing
itself,
he
closed
the
curtains
and
waited
till
he
was
alone
with
the
victim
before
entering
her
room
with
a
gun
in
his
pocket
and
the
silent
weapon
drawn.
he
struck
with
the
silent
weapon,
delivering
fatal
blows,
resorting
to
the
gun
only
when
she
screamed
and
struggled,
and
then
immediately
collected
the
shell
casings,
turned
off
the
lights,
collected
the
knife,
went
back
to
his
apartment
where
he
showered,
disposed
of
the
bloody
clothes,
concocted
a
false
alibi
message
on
the
machine
--
excuse
me
--
and
then,
overcome
with
guilt
at
the
wrongfulness
of
his
conduct,
he
calls
his
friend
and
says:
"i
messed
up
big-time".
and
that's
at
page
120
of
the
state
reporter's
transcript.
and
then,
further
acknowledging
both
the
legal
and
moral
wrongfulness
of
his
actions,
he
turns
himself
in
to
the
police.
he
says:
"i
did
a
murder".
when
they
asked
him
how
he
felt
about
it,
he
said:
"i
felt
very
guilty,
very
bad
for
what
i've
done.
"
"that's
why
i
turned
myself
in.
"
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
all
of
this
was
in
the
state
trial
transcript,
so,
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
it
was
a
direct
appeal
to
the
california
court
of
appeal
with
a
concurrently
filed
habeas
petition.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
okay.
so
he
was
faced
with
that.
and
then
on
the
flip
side,
there
was
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
mr.
mirzayance
ever
thought
that
doing
what
he
did
was
legally
or
morally
right.
so
given
all
that,
given
the
extensive
effort
to
cover
his
tracks
and
his
own
admissions
about
the
wrongfulness
of
his
conduct,
it
was
not
reasonably
probable
under
strickland
for
this
jury
to
believe
that
he
somehow
did
not
know.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
mr.
wager
did
not
believe
that
he
had
grounds
to
do
so
in
this
case.
and
the
district
court
first
addressed
that
opinion
at
the
petition
appendix
h
in
a
footnote
--
i
believe
it
was
footnote
21,
but
i
don't
have
that
in
front
of
me
right
now
--
where
the
district
court
talked
about
the
standards
for
getting
a
new
jury
and
that
under
penal
code
--
california
penal
code
1026,
you
had
to
show
some
cause
to
the
trial
court
why
this
jury
could
not
fairly
address
the
claim.
wager
felt
that
he
had
no
basis
to
do
that
at
that
time.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
okay.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
well,
i'm
confident
that,
you
know,
as
this
court
addressed
in
strickland
itself,
the
claim
fails
for
lack
of--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--nothing
to
lose.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
well,
if
--
we
agree
that
nothing
to
lose,
in
fact,
was
what
happened
here,
as
in
profitt.
the
dissent
recognized
it,
the
district
court
recognized
it,
and
i
--
i
think
you're
right
that
this
case
smacks
of
application
of
something
like
a
nothing-to-lose-type
rule.
and
perhaps
it's
announced
in
profitt,
but
it
surely
has
not
been
clearly
established
by
this
court
in
any
decision,
and
that
pre-aedpa
profitt
decision
from
the
fifth
circuit
certainly
did
not
compel
the
california
courts
or
any
other
state
court
to
apply
a
"nothing
to
lose"
rule
on
strickland
performance.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
certainly.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
well,
certainly
this
court
could,
indeed,
take
a
more
narrow
view
of
what
is
clearly
established
law.
we
agree
that
strickland
here
covers
the
vast
majority
of
ineffectiveness
cases.
but
certainly,
this
court
has
never
squarely
addressed
such
an
issue
before,
and
certainly,
this
court
has
never
announced
that
test
to
bind
the
states
to
resolve
this
claim.
i
think
that
the
fallback
position
is,
absent
a
clear
answer
from
this
court,
as
stated
in
van
patten,
absent
a
clear
answer,
the
state
courts
are
left
with
a
very
general
strickland
principle,
and
as
this
court
stated
in
yarborough
v.
alvarado,
the
more
general
the
rule,
the
more
leeway
the
states
have
in
deciding
cases
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
so
certainly
we
feel
that
wager's
decision
was
patently
reasonable
under
a
traditional
strickland
analysis.
we're
not
asking
for
anything
different.
now
i--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
think
this
comes
back
to
our
original
point,
that
the
only
dispositive
question
here
that
really
matters
is
where
the
--
when
the
state
court--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--well,
i
think
that
because
this
court
has
never
even
addressed
conduct
anything
like
this
by
an
attorney--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--i
don't
think
you
need
one
on
all
fours,
exact
fact
patterns.
that
would
be
unworkable.
what
you
do
need
to
do
is
give
the
courts
a
clear
answer
to
the
question,
and
generally--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--this
court
could
say
you
haven't
adjudicated
this--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--we're
not
asking
you
to
say
that
a
decision
like
this
could
never
be
unreasonable.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
okay?
we
are
asking
that
this
court
continue
its
strickland
jurisprudence
that
says
the
constitution
makes
one
general
requirement
and,
as
stated
in
roe
v.
flores-ortega,
that
requirement
is
that
counsel
make
reasonable
choices.
so
certainly,
there
could
be
a
situation
where
counsel
flipped
a
coin
or
made
an
arbitrary
decision
or
made
an
unreasonable
decision--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--well,
i
don't
frankly
think
this
case
necessarily
should
be
remanded
back
to
the
ninth
circuit.
they've
had
it
three
times
already.
but
i
think
that
the
writ
needs
to
be
denied
under
a
traditional
strickland
analysis,
and
--
and--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--no.
i
think
what
this
court
simply
needs
to
say
is
that
it
was
not
objectively
unreasonable--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--for
the
california
courts
to
come
out
the
other
way.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
well,
i
did
not
make
such
an
aggressive
argument
to
this
court
that
a
decision
like
this
could
never
be
unreasonable,
but
certainly
there
is
no
case
from
this
court
that
has
announced
such
a
standard.
so--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
well,
what
i
say
is
that
this
court
has
held
that
strickland
generally
applies
to
almost
all
ineffective
counsel
cases.
and
certainly
this
court
has
stated
it
applies
in
specific
type
issues
of
conduct.
for
example,
counsel
has
a
duty
to
conduct
a
reasonable
investigation;
counsel
has
a
duty
to
consult
with
his
client
about
filing
an
appeal.
but
--
but
justice
scalia
is
absolutely
right,
this
court
has
never
said
anything
remotely
like
the
rule
applied
by
the
ninth
circuit
here.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
i
think
this
court
needs
to
give
full
deference
to
the
adjudication
of
the
state
courts.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
correct.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
correct.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
yes.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
and
that's
the
situation
and
the
circumstance
outlined
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
v.
duvall,
and
it's
--
it's
a
case
and
a
procedure
designed
for
judicial
economy.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
correct.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
i
actually
think
that
that
issue
is
not
really
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
based
on
the
state
court
adjudication,
a
straightforward
analysis
under
2254(d)
of
the
california
supreme
court's
legal
resolution
of
this
claim.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
yes.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
that
is
our
primary
contention,
yes.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
correct.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
absolutely.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
yes,
it
is.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
just
a
couple
of
points
i'd
like
to
make
briefly
to
clarify
a
couple
things.
first
off,
there
was
no
finding
that
attorney
wager
misunderstood
california
law
or
somehow
was
under
the
impression
that
a
finding
of
first-degree
murder
was
legally
precluded
a
finding
of
ngi.
he
argued
at
the
state
trial
that
there's
no
question
that
an
insane
person
can
deliberate,
and
surely
while
the
jury's
verdict
was
devastating
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
he
didn't
close
up
his
books
and
go
home.
he
told
the
trial
judge,
we
need
to
reassess
this,
i
need
to
decide
who
i'm
going
to
call,
i
need
to
consult
with
my
doctors
and
my
co-counsel
and
decide
what
we're
going
to
do.
and
as
the
district
court
found
here,
and
as
wager
stated
in
the
state
court
declaration,
there
was
no
final
decision
made
until
the
morning
of
trial
when
the
parents
expressed
a
profound
reluctance
to
assist
their
son.
and
this
was,
in
fact,
his
first
ngi
defense,
but
as
mirzayance's
family
attorney
stated
in
his
state
court
declaration,
attorney
wager
was
a
10-year
expert
on
mental
health
and
sanity
issues
with
the
los
angeles
district
attorney's
office.
he
had
tried
more
than
a
hundred
trials.
he
was
the
expert.
he
had
done
his
homework
here.
he
knew
what
he
had
to
--
to
present.
he
did
not
make
a
rash
decision.
he
consulted
with
co-counsel,
and
concluded
reasonably
under
his
professional
valuation
that
the
defense
could
not
meet
its
affirmative
burden
of
proof
here.
the
second
thing
i
would
like
to
clarify
on
justice
ginsburg's
point,
there
was
some
sentencing
discretion
left
here.
it's
correct
that
wager
in
hindsight
said,
well,
perhaps
there
was
nothing
to
lose.
but
he
argued
to
the
sentencing
judge
the
very
fact
that
his
client
knew
the
wrongfulness
of
his
actions
and
was
so
remorseful
should
entitle
him
to
a
lesser
sentence
on
the
weapons
enhancement.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
the
--
the
sentencing
judge
could
have
imposed
a
high,
middle
or
low
term
for
the
weapons
enhancement.
the
underlying
sentence
was
25
to
life,
and
my
friend
is
correct,
it's
set
by
statute.
but
he
had
discretion
on
sentence
enhancement.
and
he
was
convinced
that
mirzayance
was
remorseful,
and
gave
him
a
mid-term
instead
of
a
high-term,
despite
the
facts.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
i
don't
believe
that's
correct.
i
think
it
was
a
straightforward
25-years-to-life
sentence,
plus
a
weapons
enhancement
of
4
years
added
on.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
it's
--
the
aggregate
sentence
is
25
--
excuse
me.
the
aggregate
sentence
is
29
years
to
life.
it's
25
years
to
life
for
the
first-degree
murder,
plus
4
years
for
the
weapons
enhancement
in
this
term,
a
mid-term,
because
wager
successfully
argued
that
his
client
was
remorseful.
second--
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
--i
believe
that
it
was
--
i
believe
that
it
was
6
years
as
opposed
to
4.
it
may
have
been
8
years
as
opposed
to
4.
i
don't
know.
that's
not
discussed
in
the
state
court
record.
and
finally,
mr.
mirzayance
concedes
that
"nothing
to
lose"
would
be
an
inappropriate
new
rule
by
this
court.
he
no
longer
calls
it
that.
he
doesn't
--
he
disagrees
with
the
dissent's
view
on
that.
what
he
calls
it
is
this.
this
is
the
rule
in
his
own
description
at
page
30
of
his
brief,
how
the
ninth
circuit
granted
relief
here.
excuse
me,
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
steven
e.
mercer
that
the
decision,
fairly
read,
states
only
that
counsel
has
a
duty
to
present
substantial
viable
defense
where
there
was
an
objective
prospect
for
success
and
no
strategic
or
other
benefit
in
abandoning
it.
this
court
has
never
held
such
a
rule
to
bind
the
states.
