justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
some
point
during
the
oral
argument,
and
perhaps
at
the
beginning
because
it
is
the
beginning
inquiry
--
when
there
is
an
evidentiary
hearing,
how
does
the
standard
for
the
court
of
appeals
differ
than
when
there
has
been
no
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
put
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let
me
put
it
this
way.
we're
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit,
assume.
what
effect
do
we
give
to
what
the
district
court
did,
and
how
would
that
--
how
would
the
case
be
different
than
if
we
were
simply
reviewing
the
same
situation
and
it
came
from
the
state
court?
what's
the
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
just
pretend
the
hearing
didn't
happen?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
look
to
the
federal
court
evidentiary
hearing
as
part
of
the
analysis
to
determine
whether
what
the
state
court
did
was
reasonable?
and
you
--
and
you've
thought
about
this,
and
obviously
the
problem
is,
since
the
california
appellate
courts
didn't
see
the
hearing,
this
is
an
artificial
exercise.
so
you
know
the
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
any
--
did
any
point
--
did
the
state
at
any
point
challenge
the
correctness,
the
propriety,
of
holding
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
so,
is
that
before
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
so
then
--
so
then
we
do
look
at
the
facts.
i
don't
want
to
take
up
your
or
the
court's
time
on
this
anymore,
but
i
remain
puzzled,
i
have
to
tell
you,
about
what
to
do
with
this
hearing.
i
--
i
went
through
it
at
great
length.
it's
a
very
careful
factfinding,
really.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
--
i
just
don't
know
how
to
fit
that
with
the
standard
when
i
look
at
the
--
the
reasonableness
of
the
--
of
the
state
court
decision.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
--
if
the
profitt
--
the
fifth
circuit
--
profitt,
the
fifth
circuit
case,
applies
in
the
ninth,
and
i
--
circuit
--
and
i
would
think
it
would,
just
as
the
magistrate
judge
thought
that
it
would
--
then
that
would
be
--
present
a
very
close
case
and
it
would
probably
require
reversal
of
the
state
court,
wouldn't
you
think,
if
the
profitt
rule
applied?
what
is
it?
the
all
or
--
not
all
or
nothing--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--nothing
to
lose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
we
say
that
and
if
profitt
is
inconsistent
with
that,
do
we
then
remand
or
do
we
say
on
this
record
clearly
it
was
reasonable?
obviously,
you
want
us
to
do
the
latter,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
don't
we
have
to
go
--
don't
we
have
to
say
that
this
was
reasonable
conduct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
didn't
use
the
word
"functional
equivalent"
in
the
portions
i
read.
maybe
you
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
no,
he
didn't.
and
he
told
the
trial
judge,
i've
got
an
uphill--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--almost
perpendicular.
and
he
had
--
each
--
each
and
every
one
of
those
experts
in
their
affidavits,
in
their
reports,
had
said
that
he
didn't
have
deliberation
or
premeditation.
they
were
getting
ready
for
that.
and
he
felt
that
this
would
be
devastating
cross-examination
material
because
the
jury
had
already
found
the
opposite.
so
they've
already
disbelieved
the
expert
on
this
point.
now,
it's
true,
it's
true,
that
the
knowledge
of
--
of
wrongfulness
is
--
is
probably
slightly
more
extensive
than
premeditation.
but
based
on
the
defense
that
he
was
going
to
present,
that
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing
at
this
time,
he
had
a
very,
very
difficult
obstacle
to
overcome.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
but
couldn't
he
also
give
life?
he
could
also
give
the
max,
which
was
life,
couldn't
he,
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
he
didn't.
he's
tried
a
hundred
cases.
he
had
moot
or
mock
--
mock
trials
where
he
was
asking
the
experts
these
questions
with
the
co-counsel.
and
you
want
us
to
--
to
say
that
he
didn't
understand
the
law?
and
there's
no
--
there's
no
finding
to
that
effect.
there's
no
finding
to
that
effect,
that
he
did
not
understand
the
law
by
the
magistrate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
by
the
magistrate,
there's
no
finding
to
that
effect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
strike
the
expert's
testimony.
the
expert
testified
at
some
length,
the
--
the
psychiatrist.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
was
relevant
to
premeditation
and
deliberation,
and
the
jury
did
consider
what
the
mental
health
expert
said.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
please
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
as
a
general
rule
psychiatrists
don't
--
don't
testify
as
to
the
ultimate
standard.
they
testify
as
to
the
condition
and
--
and
the
symptoms
of
--
of
the
defendant,
and
then
the
jury
makes
that
conclusion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
he
served
his
time
so
far
in
a
regular
institution?
