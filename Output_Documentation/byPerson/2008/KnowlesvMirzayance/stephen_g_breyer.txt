justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
didn't.
what
we're
going
to
discover,
i
suspect,
when
we
actually
dig
into
this
record,
which
is
pretty
extensive,
are
two
things.
the
first
is
the
california
court
of
appeals
does
not
seem
to
have
dealt
with
the
particular
issue
in
front
of
us.
they
talked
about
a
due
process
issue
at
the
end
of
their
paragraph.
they
talk
about
things
that
are
close
to
it,
but
they
nowhere
say
expressly
how
they
are
deciding
the
question
of
whether
there
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
for
the
reason
that
he
didn't
put
on
this
insanity
defense.
that's
going
to
be
our
first
problem.
then
i
looked
to
see
and
got
the
record
out
to
see,
if
he
raised
it,
and
he
did
raise
it.
so
we
have
the
fact
that
they
didn't
talk
about
it,
and
then
we
have
the
fact
that,
of
course,
the
supreme
court
of
california
just
says
one
word,
"denied".
then
when
we
discover
round
two
in
the
ninth
circuit,
we
are
going
to
discover
some
language
which
says
we
are
not
relying
on
this
rule.
there
is
no
such
rule,
as
a
rule
of
you
have
to
make
a
defense
as
a
last
resort.
here's
what
they
say.
where
this
--
instead
of
that
we
say,
forget
about
that,
we
were
wrong
the
first
time,
we
assume.
where
the
state
court
has
provided
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
--
that
is,
it
did
say
denied
--
but
has
not
explained
its
underlying
reasoning
or
held
an
evidentiary
hearing,
we
conduct
an
independent
review
of
the
record
to
determine
the
state
court's
final
resolution
of
the
case,
whether
it
was
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
so
they
say
we
did
conduct
that
record
independent
review,
and
our
conclusion
is
that
it
was
unreasonable.
okay?
nothing
to
do
with
any
special
rule
here
or
anything.
we
just
think
it
was
unreasonable.
all
right.
now,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
with
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
that
deference
going
to
be?
i
take
it
what
it
would
be
is
that
the
person,
the
defendant,
would
have
in
his
petition
--
which
we
don't
actually
have
--
would
have
said
the
facts
are
thus
and
so,
and
since
they
had
no
hearing,
they
would
have
to
take
those
facts
as
being
thus
and
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
we
would
have
to
say,
was
it
unreasonable
of
them
on
the
facts
as
they
might
have
taken
them
most
favorable
to
the
defendant?
is
that
what
we're
supposed
to
do?
was
it
unreasonable
of
them
to
conclude
for
the
state's
favor
in
light
of
reading
these
facts
as
most
possible
favorable
for
the
defendant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
what
we
should
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
we
have
to
reach
this
hearing
issue
because
we
have
to
say,
insofar
as
the
hearing
reached
a
different
result,
we
should
ignore
it
for
the
reason
that
the
statute
tells
us
to
consider
the
reasonableness
of
the
state
court's
decision
in
light
of
the
facts
on
the
record
before
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
have
to
reach
a
huge
number
of
issues
which
we've
never
decided.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
how
are
we
supposed
to
do
it?
that's
why
i
raised
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there's
no
hole
in
the
statute.
what
it
says
to
do,
quite
explicitly,
is
it
says
that
you
have
to
see
whether
the
state
court
decision
was
unreasonable
in
light
of
the
evidence
presented
in
the
state
court.
so
it
tells
us
what
to
do.
it
says
look
at
the
evidence
in
the
state
court,
and
like
any
other
instance
where
there
is
no
hearing
--
every
day
of
the
week,
judges
refuse
to
give
a
hearing.
now,
when
they
do
that,
they
have
to
assume
the
facts
in
favor
of
the
losing
party.
so
the
question
is,
assuming
the
facts
in
favor
of
your
client,
was
the
decision
that
he
loses
unreasonable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
said
yes.
is
there
any
finding
on
that
in
the
federal
court?
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now
--
now,
that's
--
that's
why
i
don't
know
how
to
proceed
because
it
seems
to
me
to
decide
that
question
just
as
i
said
it.
when
i
said
it,
i
don't
think
what
i
said
is
clear
in
the
law
of
this
statute.
there
are
two
sides
to
it.
we
just
had
a
case
where
there
were
many
briefs
on
this
question.
so
--
so
i'm
--
i'm
slightly
uncertain
what
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
law
of
the
federal
government,
i
would
have
thought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
summary
judgment
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
my
fault.
i'm
--
i'm
referring
by
shorthand
to
a
rule
56
summary-judgment-type
standard.
all
those
facts
are
assumed
on
your
side
in
which
they're
material,
and
there
has
to
be
in
the
evidence
a
reasonable
basis
for
dispute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
my
mistaken
refusal
--
i
should
have
said
rule
56.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
--
what
do
you
do
with
the
last
sentence
of
the
supreme
--
of
the
california
court
of
appeal's
opinion?
none
of
the
exculpatory
evidence
defendant
recites,
including
evidence
of
his
mental
disorder,
was
reasonably
likely
to
persuade
a
jury
that
defendant
did
not
premeditate
and
deliberate
the
killing.
and
from
that
they
conclude
that
there
is
no
reasonable
probability
that,
but
for
the
errors,
a
different
verdict
would
have
been
reached,
i.e.,
that
it
doesn't
satisfy
the
second
part
of
strickland.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
just
reading
from
the
california
court
of
appeal.
because
i
look
at
that.
i
think
when
i
go
back
and
see
what
was
the
evidence
in
front
of
them,
i'm
going
to
find
all
these
--
all
these
things,
not
the
last
part
by
the
way,
not
--
not
the
part
about
the
counsel
admitting
he
was
wrong
or
whatever
this
argument
we're
having
now.
we
won't
find
that,
but
we'll
find
everything
else
there.
and
so
they're
using
that
as
the
basis
to
say
there
was
no
prejudice.
and
now,
i
guess
that
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
federal
courts
would
have
to
defer
to
that
finding
on
prejudice.
now,
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
keep
saying
29
years.
is
it
29
years
to
life?
is
that
just
a
misprint
or--
