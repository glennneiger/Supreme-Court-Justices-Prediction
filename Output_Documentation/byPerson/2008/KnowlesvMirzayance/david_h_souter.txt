justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
you
--
would
you
agree
just
as
a
general
rule
that
unless
we
find
--
unless
there
is
some
rule
under
which
we
can
conclude
that
the
state
court
should
have
held
a
hearing,
that
there
is
no
occasion
to
have
a
federal
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would
be
the
general
proposition.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
was
--
was
--
is
all
of
this
factual
material
in
the
--
in
the
documents
submitted
with
the
habeas
--
with
the
state
habeas
and
the
response
to
the
state
habeas?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
--
what
did
they
do?
did
they
submit
the
trial
transcript
with
the
--
in
--
with
the
response
to
the
habeas
petition
at
the
state?
in
other
words,
how
did
it
get
in
front
of
the
state
court,
is
all
i
want
to
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
ah,
okay,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then
if
--
if
we
get
to
that
point,
i
think
your
argument
is
as
follows.
i'm
not
sure.
i
want
you
to
tell
me.
if
the
state
court
adjudication
was
--
was
contrary
to
what
justice
stevens'
hypo
suggested
might
be
the
"total
fool"
rule,
in
other
words
no
one
but
a
complete
nincompoop
would
have
failed
to
--
to
press
forward
with
this
defense,
then
we
can
decide
the
case
simply
under
strickland,
because
strickland
unreasonableness
is
certainly
going
to
cover
the
total
fool
case.
but
if
we
have
something
less
egregious
than
the
total
fool
case,
then
we've
got
to
look
for
more
precise
supreme
court
precedent,
and
that's
what
gets
us
into
the
musladin
or
musladin
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
we
get
to
the
musladin
sort
of
level
of
generality,
we
do
not
have
any
determination
from
this
court,
any
clearly
established
law
from
this
court,
that
would
indicate
that
the
state
court's
adjudication
or
determination
was
unreasonable
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
your
road
map?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
your
--
the
need
for
the
evidentiary
hearing,
as
i
understand
it,
was
raised
by
you
in
the
following
way.
you
said
to
the
california
supreme
court
there
is
on
the
face
of
the
--
the
papers
filed
here
a
violation
of
strickland
and
a
--
or
a
misapplication
of
strickland
in
--
in
the
way
the
california
trial
court
came
out.
but
if
you
do
not
find
a
facial
violation
of
strickland
based
on
these
papers,
then
you
should
remand
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
that
follows
at
all.
if
there's
no
strickland
error,
that
seems
to
me
a
--
an
odd
premise
to
say
you
ought
to
remand
for
a
hearing.
aren't
you
under
an
obligation
to
specify
factual
issues
that
--
specifically
that
need
to
be
developed,
before
you
would
make
out
a
case
for
saying
they
were
in
error
in
not
holding
the
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
saying
that
you
specified
the
evidentiary
issues
that
you
wanted
to
develop?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
was
that
--
i
mean,
i'm
just
asking
you.
i'm
asking
you
--
i'm
throwing
you
a
softball.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
--
are
you
saying
that
that
was,
in
effect,
an
adequate
way
to
tell
the
california
supreme
court
that
these
are
the
issues
that
we
want
to
develop
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
that
aren't
sufficiently
developed
in
the
documents?
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
--
maybe
he
did,
but
when
we
come
to
judge
prejudice,
don't
we
have
to
judge
prejudice
by
considering
exactly
what
justice
ginsburg
just
said?
in
other
words,
our
standard,
the
--
the
standard
--
number
one,
the
standard
for
strickland
prejudice
is
--
is
an
objective
--
i
mean,
the
standard
for
--
for
--
of
performance
is
an
objective
standard.
and
the
standard
for
prejudice
has
got
to
be
an
objective
standard,
too.
and
even
though
he
said,
i
didn't
do
this
for
tactical
reasons,
if
a
--
if
a
sound
lawyer
would
have
entertained
exactly
the
tactical
reason
that
justice
ginsburg
just
outlined,
isn't
that
crucial
to
the
determination
of
prejudice?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
shouldn't
that
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
did
he
know
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
judge
hadn't
sentenced
yet.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
the
judge
had
no
discretion
whatsoever?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
therefore--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you're
saying
the
terms
of
the
sentence
had
to
be
25
to
life?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
was
no
discretion
on
the
trial
judge's
part.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
--
what
discretion
did
the
judge
have?
