justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
it
could
be
--
it
could
be
if
--
if
we
have
an
opinion
that
makes
it
clear
that
you
--
you
must
grant
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
--
in
certain
cases.
and
if
the
state
court
did
not
grant
an
evidentiary
hearing,
i
guess
you
could
say
that
that
was
contrary
to
established
supreme
court
law,
couldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
unless
--
unless
there
is
a
supreme
court
requirement
that
there
be
an
evidentiary
hearing,
i
don't
see
how
holding
an
evidentiary
hearing
could
show
that
the
state
court
decision,
which
was
legitimately
held
without
an
evidentiary
hearing,
was
contrary
to
our
opinions.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
we
hold
a
hearing
ourselves
in
the
--
in
the
hypothetical
situation
that
justice
souter
mentioned?
why
shouldn't
we
just
reverse
the
state
courts
for
not
having
held
an
evidentiary
hearing?
remand
it
to
them,
let
them
hold
it,
and
let
--
let
them
make
the
factual
determination
on
the
basis
of
that,
after
which
we
would
--
we
would
apply
the
rather
strict
2254
standard
to
--
to
the
result
of
that
hearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand
that.
so
your
--
your
answer
to
justice
souter
would
not
be
that
--
that
you
can
conduct
a
hearing
if
the
state
should
have
conducted
a
hearing?
what
you
should
do
if
the
state
should
have
conducted
a
hearing
is
send
it
back
for
a
hearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
--
mr.
mercer,
i
guess
we
could
resolve
the
case
by
saying
if
there
was
any
error,
it
was
harmless,
but
we
didn't
take
the
case
for
that.
that
wouldn't
be
very
helpful
to
the
bar,
would
it?
i
mean,
i
thought
that
the
important
issue
here
is
--
is
the
one
you've
been
discussing,
whether
--
whether,
in
fact,
you're
bound
to
stick
with
the
facts
that
were
--
were
adjudicated
by
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
let's
not
do
that,
then.
let's
--
let's
decide
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
but
the
issue
is
not
whether
it's
unreasonable
or
not.
the
issue
is
whether
it's
an
unreasonable
application
of
--
of
clearly
established
supreme
court
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
reasonableness
or
unreasonableness
is
out
of
the
question.
you
--
you
first
just
have
to
look
to
supreme
court
law
and
say,
is
it
conceivably
an
unreasonable
application
of
that.
and
--
and
the
answer
to
that
is
we
--
we
haven't
decided
the
question
of
whether
this
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
and
therefore,
it
cannot
possibly
be
an
unreasonable
application
of
supreme
court
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
that
seems
to
me
not
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
precisely
what
we
have
to
decide?
or
wouldn't
it
be
whether
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
the
state
court
not
to
come
to
that
conclusion,
which
is
one
step
removed?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
the
usual
test
that
the
state
court
has
to
be
affirmed,
unless
it's
an
unreasonable
application
of
supreme
court
law,
is
altered
when
the
state
court
has
not
had
an
evidentiary
hearing
that
the
federal
habeas
court
believes
should
have
been
held?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
get
that
out
of
the
statute?
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what
do
you
rely
on
for
the
proposition
that
if
--
if
you
deny
a
hearing,
all
of
the
facts
for
which
the
hearing
was
demanded
have
to
be
assumed
in
favor
of
the
party
who
asked
for
the
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
that
can't
be.
what
--
what
if
i
deny
the
hearing
because
there
are
ample
facts
that
show
what
--
what
the
situation
was,
and
a
hearing
would
in
my
view
be
absolutely
redundant?
and
therefore,
all
of
the
facts
that
support
the
other
side
have
to
be
washed
out
simply
because
i've
denied
a
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wasn't
addressing
that.
i
was
addressing
the
proposition
that
when
you
deny
a
hearing,
all
of
the
facts
for
which
you
--
you
demanded
the
hearing
have
to
be
assumed
in
your
favor.
i
--
it
seems
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--25
to
life
is
25,
26,
27,
28.
he
has
25
years'
worth
of
discretion,
doesn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
take
that
to
mean
under
california
law,
since
the
jury
found
the
one,
it
has
to
find
the
other.
he
wasn't
making
that
argument.
he
was
saying
any
jury
that
found
that
this
was
done
intentionally,
that's
done,
you
know,
with
--
with
planning,
with
--
with
cover-up
and
what
not,
that
jury
is
not
going
to
find
that
he
was
crazy.
that's
all
he
was
saying,
and
--
and
that
seems
to
me
entirely
reasonable.
