chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
afternoon
in
case
07-1315,
knowles
v.
mirzayance.
mr.
mercer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
that
--
would
that
principle
have
to
be
clearly
established
by
one
of
our
decisions?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
--
the
fundamental
question
is
what
level
of
generality
you
look
to
determine
what
law
has
been
clearly
established?
certainly
strickland
is
clearly
established.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
the
"nothing
to
lose"
issue
has
not
been
addressed
by
us
and
is
not
clearly
established.
so
why
do
we
look
at
it
at
the
latter
level
of
generality
as
opposed
to
the
former?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
--
you
think
--
i
guess
it's
not
open
to
us
to
issue
a
decision
on
the
"nothing
to
lose"
question,
or
we
don't
have
to.
the
only
--
the
way
we
have
to
decide
the
case
is
to
determine
whether
the
ninth
circuit's
determination
on
the
"nothing
to
lose"
question
was
clearly
established
by
one
of
our
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
--
i
don't
understand
why
you
keep
talking
about
strickland.
we
sent
this
case
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
carey
v.
musladin.
in
that
case
we
said
that
the
grant
of
relief
was
unreasonable
because
of
the
lack
of
holdings
from
this
court
regarding
the
potentially
prejudicial
effect
of
spectators'
courtroom
conduct
of
the
kind
involved
here,
which
seems
to
me
a
much
narrower
focus
on
the
level
of
generality
than
strickland.
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
said
--
maybe
you
are
saying
--
that
because
we
don't
have
a
precedent
from
this
court
rejecting
the
"nothing
to
lose"
case,
that
that
should
be
the
end
of
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
sevilla.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
reject
it
as
well,
i
take
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
concede
it
is
an
improper
--
it
is
not
a
basis
for
ineffective
assistance
that
somebody
did
not
pursue
a
"nothing
to
lose"
case
argument?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
i
don't
--
i
didn't
follow
that
answer.
you're
saying
if
he
does
have
nothing
to
lose,
it
is
objectively
unreasonable
for
him
not
to
go
ahead
with
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
will
we
have
to
look
at
this
counsel's
performance
under
strickland,
i
guess,
and
determine
whether
it
was
objectively
unreasonable
in
light
of
strickland,
filtered
through
yarborough?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
talking
about
--
in
strickland
--
right
here.
in
strickland,
we
said
that
if
a
decision
by
counsel
is
made
upon,
quote,
thorough
investigation,
it
is,
quote,
virtually
unchallengeable.
now,
which
of
these
facts
in
the
petitioner's
brief
is
wrong:
that
wager
retained
eight
expert
doctors
to
evaluate
mirzayance's
mental
health;
he
retained
jury
consultants;
he
conducted
a
mock
trial
in
which
he
presented
mental
health
defenses
to
two
juries;
he
hired
a
private
investigator
to
interview
friends
and
associates;
he
consulted
with
mirzayance's
parents
and
their
attorneys;
he
discussed
the
case
with
a
retained
expert
doctor
after
decision
and
his
co-counsel?
now,
that
sounds
like
pretty
thorough
investigation
of
the
defense
you
say
he
should
have
raised.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
all
the
points
that
your
--
your
friend
began
with,
which
shows
his
conscious
deliberation,
his
knowledge
not
only
about
how
to
go
about
killing
somebody,
but
also
guilt,
the
recognition
of
the
wrongfulness
of
what
he
had
done
--
all
that
under
california
law
doesn't
enter
into
a
consideration
of
insanity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
that,
but
counsel
here
at
the
time
retained
eight
expert
doctors
to
evaluate
his
mental
health.
he
conducted
the
mock
jury
trial.
he
interviewed
the
parents.
he
hired
an
investigator
to
interview
friends.
what
you're
saying
is,
well,
here's
--
if
he
had
hired
a
ninth
expert,
he
might
have
come
out
differently.
that
sounds
like
a
thorough
investigation
under
strickland.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
isn't
that
--
aren't
you
back
to
the
"nothing
to
lose"
argument?
he
conducted
this
investigation,
which
under
strickland
we
said
makes
the
decision
virtually
unchallengeable,
and
you're
saying,
well,
he
has
an
obligation
to
proffer
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
he's
got
nothing
to
lose?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
that
gets
me
back
to
what
one
--
what
i
thought
the
case
was
postured
in,
which
is
whether
or
not
a
case
from
this
court
clearly
establishes
when
you
have
nothing
to
lose,
you've
got
to
go
ahead
and
present
the
defense,
or
it's
a
violation
of
strickland.
and
what
case
is
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
--
i
understood
your
responses
to
the
various
questions
here
to,
in
effect,
be
arguing
for
that
standard.
you're
saying,
look,
he
was
going
to
get
the
same
sentence
anyway.
you
know,
all
--
all
your
answers
sound
to
me
like
nothing
to
lose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
he
made
a
determination
--
he
made
a
determination
after
thorough
investigation,
the
various
points
i
went
through
with
you
earlier,
that
it
was
not
a
credible
defense.
now,
maybe
that
was
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
--
under
strickland,
we
said
it's
virtually
unchallengeable,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
objectively
unreasonable
in
light
of
clearly
established
law
from
this
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
mercer,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
would
he
have
gotten
in
the
high
term?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-1315,
knowles
versus
mirzayance.
