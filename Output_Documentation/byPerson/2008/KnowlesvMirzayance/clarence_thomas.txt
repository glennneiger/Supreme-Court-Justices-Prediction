justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent
confessed
that
he
stabbed
his
19-year
old
cousin
nine
times
and
shot
her
four
times.
she
died.
at
trial,
he
entered
pleas
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
which
under
state
law
required
a
bifurcated
trial.
during
the
first
phase,
respondent
attempted
to
avoid
first-degree
murder
conviction
and
instead
obtain
a
second-degree
murder
conviction
by
presenting
medical
testimony
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
thus
incapable
of
premeditation
or
deliberation.
the
jury
nonetheless
convicted
respondent
a
first-degree
murder.
respondent's
counsel
then
recommended
that
he
abandon
his
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
plea.
counsel
believed
that
the
jury
was
unlikely
to
accept
an
insanity
defense
which
would
have
been
based
on
medical
testimony
similar
to
evidence
presented
in
the
first
phase.
also,
counsel's
plan
to
supplement
the
medical
evidence
during
the
second
phase
with
testimony
from
respondent's
parents
failed
when
the
parents
refused
to
testify.
respondent
accepted
his
attorney's
advice
and
withdrew
his
insanity
defense.
in
state
post-conviction
proceedings,
respondent
alleged
that
the
recommendation
to
withdraw
the
insanity
defense
constituted
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
under
the
court
--
this
court's
decision
in
strickland
versus
washington.
the
state
trial
court
denied
relief
and
the
california
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
respondent
next
applied
for
federal
habeas
which
the
district
court
denied.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
ordering
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
counsel's
recommendations
to
withdraw
the
insanity
defense.
on
remand,
the
magistrate
judge
found
that
counsel
had
made
a
carefully
reasoned
decision
not
to
proceed
with
the
insanity
defense.
the
magistrate
judge
nonetheless
concluded
that
the
district
court
was
bound
by
the
court
of
appeals'
remand
order
to
determine
only
whether
counsel
had
tactical
reason
for
abandoning
the
defense.
because
the
magistrate
judge
found
that
respondent
had
“nothing
to
lose
by
proceeding
with
the
insanity
defense”
the
magistrate
judge
held
that
counsel's
performance
was
deficient.
as
to
prejudice,
the
magistrate
judge
concluded
that
the
district
court
was
similarly
bound
by
the
remand
order
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
described
the
insanity
defense
as
remaining
viable
and
strong.
the
court
of
appeal
--
the
district
court
accepted
the
magistrate
judge's
recommendation
and
granted
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
2007,
we
granted
the
state's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
vacated
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
and
remanded
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
our
decision
in
carey
versus
musladin
which
addressed
the
proper
method
for
evaluating
whether
a
state
court
decision
“involved
an
unreasonable
application
of
clearly
established
federal
law
as
determined
by
the
supreme
court
for
the
purposes
of
granting
federal
habeas
relief
under
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act,
aedpa.
on
remand,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
its
decision
was
unaffected
by
musladin
and
again,
affirmed
the
grant
of
habeas
corpus.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
conclude
that
the
state
court's
denial
of
respondent's
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
did
not
violate
clearly
established
federal
law.
the
court
of
appeals
reached
a
contrary
result
in
large
part
because
it
blamed
counsel
for
abandoning
the
insanity
defense
when
there
was
“nothing
to
lose”
by
pursuing
it.
but
this
court
has
not
established
anything
akin
to
a
nothing
to
lose
standard.
thus,
habeas
corpus
is
warranted
only
if
the
state
court
decision
unreasonably
apply
the
general
strickland
standard
for
ineffective
assistance
claims.
it
did
not.
furthermore,
respondent's
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
would
fail
even
under
de
novo
review.
strickland
requires
a
defendant
to
establish
efficient
performance
and
prejudice.
respondent
has
established
neither.
he
has
not
shown
that
his
counsel's
performance
fell
below
an
objective
standard
of
reasonableness
by
recommending
the
withdrawal
of
a
defense
that
he
reasonably
believed
was
destined
for
failure.
respondent
is
also
unable
to
show
that
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
he
would
have
prevailed
on
his
insanity
defense
had
he
pursued
it.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justices
scalia,
souter,
and
ginsburg
joined
all
but
part
ii
of
the
opinion.
