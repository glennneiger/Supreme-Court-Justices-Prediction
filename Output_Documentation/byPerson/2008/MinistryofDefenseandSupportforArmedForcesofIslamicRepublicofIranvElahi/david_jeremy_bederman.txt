mr.
david
j.
bederman
mr.
chief
justice,
good
morning
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
heart
of
this
appeal
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
respondent
received
$2.3
million
in
public
funds
under
the
victims
protection
and
terrorism
risk
insurance
act.
tria
provides,
and
this
is
at
the
blue
brief,
page
11a,
that
a
party
electing
to
receive
such
funds
must
relinquish
rights
with
respect
to
enforcement
against
property
that
is
at
issue
in
claims
against
the
united
states
before
an
international
tribunal
or
that
is
the
subject
of
awards
by
such
tribunal.
the
property
in
question
here
is
the
cubic
judgment.
respondent
renounced
rights
to
attach
the
cubic
judgment
because
in
case
b/61
before
the
iran-united
states
claims
tribunal
at
the
hague
the
united
states
has
demanded
that
any
awards
iran
receives
in
its
claim
against
the
united
states
be
set
off
by
the
amount
of
the
cubic
judgment.
this
can
only
occur
if
the
cubic
judgment
is
released
from
respondent's
lien
and
is
remitted
to
iran's
ministry
of
defense.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
no,
in
that
scenario
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
would
not
be
implicated,
because
i
think
the
clear
import
of
the
statutory
language
here
that
congress
is
trying
to
achieve
is
that
being
at
issue
--
as
you'll
notice,
the
statutory
provision
in
201(c)
is
disjunctive.
it
refers
to
claims
against
the
united
states
--
at
issue
in
claims
against
the
united
states
before
an
international
tribunal,
or
that
is
the
subject
of
an
award.
so
i
think
the
disjunctive
character
of
the
statute
might
indicate
that
the
at-issue
prong
includes
a
broader
set
of
property
than
would
be
indicated
possibly
by
the
"subject
of
an
award".
mr.
david
j.
bederman
well,
the
mutual
--
let
me
be
clear.
the
mutual
position
of
iran
and
the
united
states
before
the
claims
tribunal
is
that
the
cubic
judgment,
because
it's
related
to
a
claim
within
the
tribunal's
jurisdiction
--
and
i
think
that's
a
key
limiting
principle
here.
the
united
states
would
not
be
entitled
to
set
off
amounts
in
bank
accounts
that
are
attributable
to
other
parties
or
other
aspects
that
are
not
implicated
in
claims
or
defenses
before
the
tribunal.
so
clearly
an
examination
of
the
tribunal's
jurisdiction
and
the
relevant
claims
or
defenses
that
are
before
the
tribunal
is
relevant
here.
petitioner
is
not
espousing
a
position
before
this
court
that
any
inchoate
property
located
anywhere
in
the
world
would
be
blanketed
with
immunity
under
this
provision.
it's
not
necessary
to
reach
that
conclusion
in
order
to
find
for
petitioner
here.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
yes,
that
is
the
language
used
by
the
united
states
in
a
memorial
before
the
tribunal.
the
united
states
has
also
indicated,
and
this
is
clear
in
the
gray
brief
at
pages
81
in
note
32
and
the
gray
brief
at
pages
83
to
85,
and
in
the
lodgment,
that
if
--
if
iran
receives
an
award
in
case
b/61
it
must
be
offset
or
set
off,
or
"recouped"
is
sometimes
the
language
used
in
the
correspondence
between
the
two
governments
before
the
tribunal,
by
the
amount
of
the
cubic
judgment.
i
won't
speak
for
the
united
states
position
before
the
tribunal.
the
united
states
is
here
to
do
that,
of
course,
justice
ginsburg.
but
the
only
way
i
can
interpret
that
remark
is
to
indicate
that
obviously
before
the
tribunal
is
the
issue
of
the
united
states'
obligations
to
iran
under
the
algiers
accords.
the
cubic
judgment
deals,
of
course,
with
the
private
disposition
of
the
contractual
relationship
between
iran's
ministry
of
defense
and
the
cubic
military
contractor.
now
respondents
take
the
position
that
these
two
make
the
matters
unrelated.
but
if
you
review
carefully
the
tribunal's
jurisdiction
as
encompassing
both
claims
and
counterclaims,
and
according
to
the
algiers
accords
in
the
claims
settlement
declaration,
counterclaims
include
that
which
arises
out
of
the
same
contract,
transaction
or
occurrence
that
constitutes
the
subject
matter
of
the
claim.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
the
first.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
that's
right.
the
united
states
did
not
file
a
formal
counterclaim
in
case
b/61,
but
it
has
made
a
demand
for
a
setoff.
and
within
the
tribunal
rules,
a
setoff
can
be
the
subject
of
notice
under
rule
19-3
or
an
amendment
or
certainly
comes
under
waiver
of
objection
provision
in
rule
30.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
there
--
there
certainly
have
been
cases,
if
you
are
speaking
of
the
tribunal's
earlier
jurisprudence
in
terms
of
offsetting
claims.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
yes,
there
has
certainly
been
ample
tribunal
precedent
which
the
united
states
has
relied
upon
in
making
this
demand
for
a
setoff.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
of
course,
the
validity
of
the
cubic
judgment
does
remain
on
appeal
when
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--i
would
assume
it
would.
and
i
assume--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--no,
justice
souter.
if
--
if
we
understand
congress'
--
i
don't
--
i
think
this
matter
can
be
resolved
by
a
straightforward
textual
approach
in
looking
at
tria
section
201(c).
evidently,
though,
if
we
are
looking
at
congressional
intent
here,
it
is
to
protect
the
united
states'
litigation
position
before
the
tribunal.
to
allow
the
attachment
of
the
cubic
judgment
would
simply
be
allowing
respondent
to
remove
a
source
of
money
that
would
be
available--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--i
won't
speak,
of
course,
for
the
united
states'
position.
the
petitioner's
position
is
that
where
property
has
been
identified
to
the
tribunal
as
being
related
to
a
claim
or
defense
within
its
jurisdiction,
and
the
availability
of
that
property
affects
the
relief
that
can
be
granted
by
the
tribunal,
it
is
at
issue.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
well,
obviously
we
await
the
tribunal's
award
in
this
respect.
and
i
believe,
based
on
the
tribunal's
past
precedents,
the
benefit
in
terms
of
finding
a
breach
of
the
algiers
accords
as
it
would
or
it
must
in
this
case
to
find
in
favor
of
iran,
would
indicate
that
the
benefits
accruing
for
certain
setoffs
must
ultimately
come
back
to
iran
in
order
to
be
credited
in
the
way
that
you
suggest.
i
think
it
is
an
improper
position
to
suggest
that
if
a
creditor
of
iran
or
iran's
ministry
of
defense
in
this
instance
can
claim
or
assert
the
lien
so
that
somehow
it's
credited
to
iran's
account,
so
to
speak,
in
calculating
the
setoff
of
the
tribunal.
that
has
not
been
the
tribunal's
jurisprudence
in
terms
of
examining
the
implications
of
a
breach
by
the
united
states
under
the
algiers
accords.
and
in
a
number
of
cases--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
that
has
been
a
mystery
to
me
as
well.
in
fact,
there
has
been
a
resolution
by
cubic
defense
systems
and
iran's
ministry
of
defense
and
as
soon
as
the
court
renders
its
judgment
in
this
case,
that
matter
will
finally
move
to
disposition.
it
is
a
bit
odd
that
the
underlying
issue
of
cubic's
objections
to
the
district
court's
enforcement
of
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
or
icc
arbitral
award
has
pended
for
so
long.
i
would
have
thought,
logically,
it
would
have
made
more
sense
to
have
disposed
of
those
issues
and
then
allow
the
disposition
of
the
liens
to
be
resolved
by
the
court.
essentially,
it
is
cubic's
appeal
challenging
aspects
of
the
district
court's
enforcement
under
the
new
york
convention
of
the
icc
arbitral
award.
i
think
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
counterclaim
it's
simply
that
there
were
some
bases
for
support
of
the
judgment
which
iran's
ministry
of
defense
would
have
put
forward
in
addition
to
the
district
court.
that's
what
i
understand
in
terms
of
the
ruling
of
judge
brewster
originally
in
the
district
court
on
this
matter.
so,
yes,
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
underlying
validity
of
the
cubic
judgment
still
remains
open
as
a
matter
of
appeal.
but
again
to
return
to
your
point,
justice
ginsburg,
in
cases
815
and
821
before
the
tribunal
this
question
of
what
would
be
the
implications,
financial
and
otherwise,
for
the
united
states
being
found
by
the
tribunal
to
be
in
breach
of
the
algiers
accords
because
of
the
failure
of
not
allowing
the
export
of
iranian
property
or
repatriation
of
iranian
property
to
the
united
states
has
been
explicated.
and,
in
fact,
in
already
one
instance
the
tribunal
has
found
the
united
states
to
be
in
breach
of
algiers
accords
obligations.
so
again,
i
can't
speak
for
what
a
ruling
in
the
tribunal
would
be.
all
i
can
suggest
is
certainly
the
iranian
position
before
the
tribunal
would
be
that
in
the
instance
that
if
mr.
elahi
or
any
other
lienor
were
successful
in
attaching
the
cubic
judgment
that
in
such
a
situation
it
should
not
be
credited
as
a
setoff
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
well,
i
mean,
the
issue
of
the
secretary
of
state's
october
2007
designation,
which
i
think
is
what
you
are
referring
to,
is
a
late
development
in
this
case.
of
course,
that
occurred
three
months
after
the
ninth
circuit's
amended
opinion.
my
submission
to
this
court
is
that
the
appropriate
disposition,
assuming
the
court
well
takes
petitioner's
position
that
respondent
has
actually
relinquished
its
claim
under
tria,
is
to
remand
back
to
the
district
court,
because
then
we
would
have
two
new
sets
of
lienors,
mr.
raffi
and
mr.
rubin.
it
would
be
before
the
district
court
that
factual
issues
like
whether
the
designation
of
the
"ministry
of
defense
and
armed
forces
logistics.
"
which
is
what
is
actually
named
in
the
blocking
order,
actually
covers
the
ministry
of
defense
and
support
for
the
armed
forces
of
the
islamic
republic
of
iran,
who
is
your
petitioner
today.
the
issue
of
whether
designations
cover
particular
entities
or
aliases
of
entities
is
an
intensity
factual
one;
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
national
council
of
resistance
case,
chief
justice
roberts,
an
opinion
you
are
well
aware
of
at
the
d.c.
circuit.
these
are
intensely
factual
inquiries
about
whether
aliases
of
particular
organizations
are
covered
by
designations.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
other
lienors.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
my
understanding,
justice
ginsburg,
is
in
both
the
cases
of
mr.
rubin
and
mr.
raffi,
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
they
have
not
made
the
relinquishment
election
under
tria
as
dr.
elahi
has
done
here.
and
because
they
have
not
made
the
relinquishment
proviso,
they
would
not
be
subject
to
the
at-issue
question
that
is
now
before
the
court.
iran's
ministry
of
defense
has
other
substantive
defenses
against
their
liens,
which
we
appropriately
presented
before
the
district
court.
the
only
submission
i
am
making
to
this
court
at
this
time
is
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
exercising
plenary
authority
to
decide
whether
it's
a
blocked
asset.
that
is
appropriate
for
remand
because,
notwithstanding
the
u.s.
position,
i
think
there
are
questions
of
whether
your
petitioner
is
a
covered
entity
under
the
--
under
the
designation,
and
whether
in
fact
it
is
the
beneficial
owner,
whether
iran's
air
force
is
the
beneficial
owner
of
this
claim.
and
there
are
other
substantive
defenses
that
claim
retroactivity,
as
well.
so,
again,
i
just
don't
think
it's
appropriate--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--yes.
whether
it
is
available
for
setoff.
and
again,
i
want
to
be
clear
that--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--well,
i
mean,
that
may
be
one
useful
analytic
in
thinking
about
this.
i
was
trying
in
imagining
the
interest
of
the
court
in
understanding
the
tribunal's
jurisdiction
under
the
algiers
accords
and
what
the
tribunal
has
already
ruled,
and
that's
why
i
think
respectful
consideration
might
be
appropriate
here,
inasmuch
as
the
tribunal,
in
interpreting
its
jurisdiction
under
the
algiers
accords,
which
is
essentially
its
organic
instrument,
has
made
a
determination
in
case
b/66
that
the
substantive
contracts
at
issue
here
between
cubic
and
the
iranian
air
force
are
at
issue
in
case
b/61.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
yes.
i
will
repeat
the
one
i
--
i
rendered
before
because
i
think
it
is
the
most
useful
analytic,
and
i
--
i
take
no
credit.
this
is
essentially
judge
fisher's
analysis
in
the
dissent
below.
as
he
indicated,
that
--
that
--
where
property
has
been
identified
to
the
tribunal
--
and
certainly
the
cubic
judgment
and
the
proceedings
that
have
occurred
in
the
federal
district
court
in
--
in
southern
california
and
now
the
ninth
circuit
and
now
here
have
been
identified
to
the
tribunal
in
mutual
representations
and
undertakings
by
the
parties.
where
this
property
has
been
identified
to
the
tribunal
as
being
related
to
a
claim
or
defense
within
the
tribunal's
jurisdiction
--
and
i
think
that
is
the
key
limiting
principle
here.
that's
--
there
is
a
criticism
that
an
expansive
reading
of
tria's
2,
paragraph
3.
and
then
the
second
prong
is
that
the
availability
of
that
property
affects
the
relief
that
can
be
granted
by
the
tribunal.
and,
again,
we
are
not
hypothesizing
here.
the
tribunal
has
already
indicated
in
cases
like
owens
corning,
futura
trading
and
computer
services,
that
when
you
have
a
situation
avoiding
a
double
recovery,
that
a
setoff
derived
from
collateral
proceedings,
even
absent
privity
of
contract
with
the
sovereign
seeking
adjustment
and
with
respect
to
different
causes
of
action,
a
setoff
is
still
appropriate
within
the
tribunal.
so
it's
both
an
avoidance
of
a
--
of
a
double-recovery
rule
and
also
a
notion
that
a
--
a
certain
offset
is
--
is
related
as
within
the
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribunal
as
arising
again
from
the
same
contract
transaction
or
occurrence.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
i
mean--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--petitioner
is
not
taking
the
same--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--no,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
the
petitioner's
position
is
slightly
more
modulated
than
the
united
states.
the
united
states'
position
here
is
all
it
has
to
be
is
relevant.
i
--
i
will
leave
it
to
the
court
to
--
to
speak
with
the
united
states
about
that
in
a
moment.
i
think
a
more
nuanced
understanding
of
the
tribunal's
jurisdiction
is
appropriate
here.
is
--
and
here
there
is
no
question,
based
on
the
materials
that
you
have
not
only
in
the
joint
appendix
but
also
in
the
lodgment,
that
the
cubic
contracts
have
been
identified
to
the
tribunal.
and
now
the
cubic
judgment
as
an
offset
has
a
setoff
--
or
"recoupment"
is
sometimes
the
language
used
in
the
diplomatic
exchanges
and
filings
before
the
tribunal
--
has
now
been
identified
to
the
tribunal.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
yes,
justice
breyer.
i
think
i
spoke
about
that
a
moment
ago.
that
would
be--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--my
understanding,
if
you
are
speaking
of
me
characterizing
the
united
states'
position--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--yes.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
yes,
and--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--it's
the--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--it's
the
"unless",
i
suppose,
that,
of
course,
iran
objects
to.
it
is
that
in
order
for
the
setoff
to
be
effective
within
the
tribunal's
jurisprudence
and
jurisdiction,
iran's
ministry
of
defense
or
--
or
the--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
i
agree.
if
it's
at
issue--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--correct.
if
it's
at--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--i
thought
that's
what
we
were
speaking
of:
the
status
of
the
cubic
judgment
and
--
and
dr.
elahi's
attachment
of
the--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--that
is
correct.
there
is
a
queue
of
individuals
who
have
lined
up
to
--
to--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
so
it's
"at
issue"
--
i
am
--
i
am
sorry
for
having
been
so
opague.
it
is
"at
issue"
in
the
sense
of
"joinder
at
issue",
a
legitimate
disagreement
between
the
parties.
and
its
also
"at
issue",
i
believe
--
i
think
in
the
sense
that
congress
intended
by
this
provision
of
saying
that
the
funds
are
available
for
a
tribunal
ruling.
and,
therefore,
to
allow
an
attachment
under
these
circumstances
would
frustrate
the
united
states'
litigation
position.
so
any
way
you
parse
what
"at
issue"
means--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--yes.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
yes,
justice
breyer,
you
are
correct.
there
is
a
concern,
which
is
a
very
natural
concern,
that
the
more
attenuated
you
get,
can
you
attribute
a
particular
property,
whether
it's
a
bank
account
or
a
--
or
a
new
york
condo--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--i
would
certainly
concur;
and,
if
i
may,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
if
i
can
make
just
a
few
points.
in
response
to
respondent
counsel's
assertion
that
in
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
arbitral
award
there's
been
so
form
of
novation
here,
which
makes
the
connection
between
the
acmr
and
the
cubic
judgment
somehow
attenuated.
i
think
that's
belied
by
the
tribunal's
--
the
panel's
discussion,
this
is
at
the
joint
appendix
at
page
47.
the
panel
makes
very
clear
that
under
the
sales
contract
credit
has
to
be
given
to
iran
for
its
advance
payment.
here
you
have
a
breakout
of
the
salvage
value
of
the
acmr.
all
that
the
panel
was
indicating
was
that
iran
was
not
entitled
to
specific
performance
here,
to
make
that
ruling
is
not
a
finding
of
a
novation
in
the
sense
which
would
respond
to
counsel
using
that
phrase.
so,
i
don't
see
the
attenuation
here.
speaking
to
the
assertion
that,
again,
the
enormous
risk
presented
by
this
case
of
the
broad
construction
of
the
congressional
intent,
i
think
if
you
look
carefully
at
the
language
at
the
blue
brief
at
11a
of
the
statutory
construction
provision
--
that
was
part
of
the
colloquy
between
the
chief
justice
and
respondent's
counsel.
and
if
you
read
this,
it
completely
reserves,
if
not
begs
the
question
of
whether
the
cubic
judgment
is,
quote,
an
asset
otherwise
available
under
the
section
for
attachment.
so,
i
think
it
completely
doesn't
answer,
one
way
or
the
other
--
a
finger
on
the
scale,
as
respondent's
counsel
has
evocably
said,
or
some
form
of
command
by
congress
to
this
court.
it
simply
reserves
that
question
for
the
court's
analysis.
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
last
question
to
respondent's
counsel,
the
one
thing
i
would
point
out
to
you
again,
is
another
clue
in
the
statute.
if
we
look
at
the
victims
protection
act,
which
was
the
predecessor
statute
here,
section
2002(c),
what
congress
wanted
to
protect
is
the
right
of
the
united
states
to,
quote,
pursue
these
subrogated
rights
as
claims
or
offsets
of
the
united
states
in
appropriate
ways.
so,
again,
congress
has
contemplated
the
notion
that
there
will
be
a
process
of
setoffs
either
before
the
iran
u.s.
claims
tribunal
or
in
some
other
context,
which
i'm
not
sure
i
can
imagine
beyond
what
response
counsel
has
said.
so,
to
suggest
that
the
broad
remedial
thrust
of
tria,
which
petitioner
is
not
denying
--
it's
not
our
place
to
deny
that
--
is
nonetheless
tempered
by
these
carefully
crafted
provisions
in
the
statute.
we
would
support,
obviously,
reversal
of
the
lower
court's
opinion.
