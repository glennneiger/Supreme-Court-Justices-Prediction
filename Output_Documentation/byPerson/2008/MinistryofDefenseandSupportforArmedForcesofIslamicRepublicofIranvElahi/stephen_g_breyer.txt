justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
the
case
that
there
are
two
other
individuals
who
have
attached
this
judgment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
is
it
the
case
that
iran's
position
in
respect
to
those
attachments
is
that
those
attachments,
insofar
as
they
are
valid
and
executed,
require
a
setoff
from
whatever
we
owe
iran
or
vice-versa?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i'm
saying
i
take
it
from
something
i
have
read
in
this
that
iran
believes
that
if,
in
fact,
it
won
a
judgment
and
that
judgment
is
from
someone
like
cubic--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--who
they
thought
was
prevented
from
delivering
planes
because
of
the
embargo
--
so
it
was
relevant
--
that
that
judgment,
which
they
get
if
they
collect
on
it,
should
be
deducted
from
other
money
the
united
states
owes
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--unless
instead
of
them
getting
it,
the
attacher
gets
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
attachee
gets
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
has
to
get
the
money
for
the
attaching
person.
that's
my
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
that
is
at
issue
before
the
--
and
--
and
it
is
at
issue
in
those
cases.
if
the
person
who
attaches
it
gets
the
money
rather
than
iran,
iran
will
say:
we
do
not
have
to
have
a
setoff.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
that
right
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
that
is
the
same
question
that
you
think
would
be
presented
through
this
attachment,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
dr.
elahi
is
one
of
several
persons,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
iran's
position
vis-a-vis
the
elahi
judgment
is
the
same
as
its
position
vis-a-vis
the
other
two
attachments
on
the
elahi
judgment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
if
iran
ends
up
with
the
money,
you
can
subtract
it
from
other
money
the
united
states
owes
them.
but
if
the
attaching
people
end
up
with
the
money,
you
cannot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
would
take
the
same
position
if,
in
fact,
this
money
which
is
owed
to
iran
by
--
by
cubic
--
that
is,
cubic,
which
then
iran
got
a
judgment
on
--
instead
of
a
judgment
in
favor
of
iran,
cubic
had
written
them
a
check,
and
they
had
taken
the
check
and
bought
a
house
in
manhattan,
or
they
had
put
it
in
an
iranian
bank
account,
and
either
mr.
elahi
or
one
of
the
other
two
people
sought
to
attach
the
bank
account
or
the
house
or
the
grocery
store,
which
they
might
have
also
have
used.
am
i
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
why
either
is
the
slightest
a
bit
more
attenuated.
in
either
case
they
are
owned
by
the
ministry
of
defense
of
iran.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
so
what
is
the
--
it
seems
at
the
moment,
frankly
you
could
read
it
either
way.
let's
imagine
that
--
that
cubic
sold
some
jets
that
we
blocked
and
they
get
some
money,
and
they
did
it
under
their
contract,
and
they
got
2
million
dollars.
and
suppose
they
said,
we
owe
iran
this
money,
and
they
pay
iran
the
money,
and
iran
puts
it
in
a
bank
account
or
buys
the
grocery
store.
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
suppose
that
happened.
it
makes
it
simpler.
and
then
what
happens
is
three
people,
including
mr.
elahi
and
two
others
who
don't
accept
money,
the
other
two,
attach
it,
on
the
ground
iran
owes
us
this
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
want
the
grocery
store.
and
suppose,
further,
iran
then
says,
if
they
get
their
money,
you
cannot
subtract
it,
united
states,
from
what
you
owe
us.
but
if
we
get
the
money,
then
you
can
subtract
it.
that's
their
view.
the
united
states'
view
is
different.
who
will
resolve
that
question?
the
tribunal.
so
they
say,
what
is
at
issue
is
not
who
owns
the
grocery
store;
what
is
at
issue
is
the
question
of
whether
we
get
the
money
or
you
get
the
money.
what
money?
the
money
that
is
the
value
of
the
grocery
store,
or
the
bank
account,
in
which
case
it's
identical.
now
i
think
in
that
situation
it's
easy
for
me
to
say
that
money,
the
grocery
store,
or
the
bank
account,
of
course
is
at
issue
before
the
tribunal.
for
the
question
is,
does
iran
get
it
or
does
the
united
states
get
it,
in
the
situation
where
the
two
other
people
--
leaving
elahi
out
of
it
--
can
attach
it.
i
can
easily
read
it
that
way.
i
can
also
read
it
the
way
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right?
so
now,
which
do
i
do?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i'll
then
add
that
the
strongest
argument
against
you,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
whole
point
of
this
was
not
simply
to
compensate
victims
of
terrorism.
that's
a
worthy
goal,
and
that's
one
of
the
points.
but
it
was
to
compensate
them
consistent
with
the
proper
running,
in
the
interests
of
the
united
states,
of
the
iranian-american
claims
tribunal.
and
so
this
is
just
the
kind
of
issue
we
don't
want
to
simply
take
away
and
let
the
victim
have,
because
there
is
a
strong
risk
the
tribunal
will
rule
against
us,
and
we
will
have
to
pay
it
twice.
okay.
that's
the
argument
against
you.
now,
what's
the
argument
for
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
one,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
creates
the
issue,
because
the
question
is
whether
money
that
never
goes
back
to
iran,
but
rather
goes
to
an
attaching
person,
is
money
that
is
or
money
that
is
not
subtracted
from
the
amount
that
the
united
states
owes
iran.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
question
is
the
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
the
question
that
is
before
the
commission.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are
totally
knowable.
in
order
to
decide
what
they
are
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
issues
before
the
commission
and
decide
whether
those
issues
concern
specific,
concrete
property;
that
is,
the
property
that
you
have
an
interest
in.
with
my
grocery
store,
with
my
bank
account,
and
with
this
claim,
it
is
absolutely
specific,
and
iran
has
put
before
the
commission
the
question
of
whether
if
you
pay
the
money
to
an
attaching
person,
we
don't
get
it,
or
we
do
get
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
gather.
now
you
can
tell
me
i'm
wrong
on
that
if
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are
trying
to
attach
the
acmr
system.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are
trying
to
attach
the
cubic
judgment.
the
acmr
judgment
is
in
canada.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
one
piece
of
property.
the
other
piece
of
property
that
is
at
issue
is
the
judgment,
and
the
way
it's
at
issue
is
i
take
it
that
two
other
people
are
saying,
we
attach
it;
iran
says
because
they
attach
it,
you
don't
subtract
it
from
the
acmr
judgment;
and
we
are
saying,
even
though
they
attach
it,
you
subtract
it,
and
therefore
it's
before
the
tribunal
as
well.
that's
my
understanding
at
the
moment,
and
i'm
asking
you
to
explain
why
that's
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
--
the
other
thing
--
and
i
think
this
counts
against
you,
but
maybe
you
have
an
answer
to
it,
that
there
could
be
a
lot
of
property
that
was
directly
at
issue
in
'79
or
'80
that
iran
didn't
get.
and
because
they
didn't
get
it,
all
kinds
of
things
happened
with
property,
and
you
get
more
of
it
or
you
get
less
of
it.
and
during
the
interim
years
all
kinds
of
things
happened.
and
it
could
be
that
those
transformations
at
different
times
are
directly
before
the
tribunal,
in
respect
to
how
much
damages
you
are
going
to
get,
and
how
much
--
we
can
easily
think
of
cases
if
we
have
three
or
four
hours.
but
you
see
where
i
am
going?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
can
understand
congress
in
passing
this
statute
having
one
of
two
possible
things:
one
is
say
we
are
just
going
to
cut
an
arbitrary
line
here
because
it's
a
compromise,
and
what
we
will
do
is,
you
can
go
ahead,
victim,
and
seize
anything
you
want,
as
long
as
it
doesn't
narrowly
fit
within
this.
that's
a
somewhat
arbitrary
line
but
a
compromise.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
other
way
to
look
at
it
is
to
say,
well,
what
we
that
had
in
mind
here
is
we
will
pay
these
victims
something;
you
know,
they
are
going
to
get
something
right
from
congress
right
now,
because
they
are
hurt.
but
in
return
from
that,
we
don't
want
you
taking
action
that
will
really
affect
our
liability
to
iran.
and
if
it's
the
second,
then
we
needed
broader
definition;
if
it's
the
first,
we
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
case
is
ministry
of
defense
of
iran
against
elahi.
it
is
about
a
private
lawsuit
against
the
government
of
iran,
and
it
involves
a
private
person,
dariush
elahi
who
obtained
a
default
judgment
for
$312
million
against
the
state
of
iran
based
upon
iran's
involvement
in
the
death
of
his
brother.
he
wants
to
enforce
that
judgment
in
part
by
attaching
an
asset
that's
owned
by
iran,
namely
a
$2.8
million
judgment
that
iran
won
against
the
company
called
cubic.
now
the
private
party,
mr.
elahi
can
overcome
what
is
a
normal
legal
rule
that
would
prevent
any
attachment
of
property
owned
by
a
foreign
government
as
iran
has
only
if
he
can
show
two
things.
he
has
to
show
both
that
our
government
has
blocked
iran's
assets,
which
makes
them
available
to
suit
and
attachment.
and
he
also
has
to
show
that
he
didn't
waive
by
a
certain
action
his
right
to
attach
the
cubic
judgment.
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
both
of
these
conditions
were
met
but
we
think
the
contrary.
as
to
the
first
requirement,
namely,
that
the
assets
be
blocked,
we
find
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
when
it
said
that
the
cubic
judgment
was
blocked
at
the
time
the
circuit
made
the
decision
and
all
of
the
parties
agree
on
that
including
elahi.
but
it
maybe
that
those
assets
became
reblocked
due
to
recent
executive
actions
and
that
latter
question
was
not
decided
really
by
the
court
below,
it
hasn't
been
fully
argued
so
we
won't
decide
it
either.
we
turn
instead
to
the
waiver
question.
now
in
2003,
the
united
states
paid
elahi
$2.3
million
as
partial
compensation
for
his
claim
against
iran.
when
he
got
that
money,
he
signed
a
paper
and
he
agreed
in
that
paper
to
relinquish
“all
rights
to
attach
property
that
is
at
issue
in
claims
against
the
united
states
before
an
international
tribunal.”
and
there,
we
have
to
say
we
think
the
cubic
judgment
is
property
that
is
at
issue
in
one
of
those
tribunals,
namely
the
iran-u.s.
claims
tribunal
that
was
set
up
by
the
algiers
accords
years
ago.
united
states
and
iran
do
not
dispute
that
the
valid
--
they
think
the
cubic
judgment
is
valid.
they
agree.
but
they
do
dispute
whether
iran,
if
it
win
some
of
its
other
claims
there,
has
to
use
that
cubic
judgment
as
a
set
off
against
the
money
the
united
states
would
otherwise
owe
it.
in
particular,
if
anybody
has
attached
the
judgment,
iran
says
it
does
not
have
to
use
the
judgment
as
a
set
off.
the
united
states
says
it
does
have
to
use
the
judgment
as
a
set
off.
so
this
dispute
in
our
view
means
the
judgment
is
at
issue
in
that
forum.
thus,
it
is
the
kind
of
property
that
elahi,
when
he
received
the
$2.3
million
from
the
government,
promised
not
to
attach
and
he
has
to
live
up
to
that
promise.
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part,
which
justices
souter
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
