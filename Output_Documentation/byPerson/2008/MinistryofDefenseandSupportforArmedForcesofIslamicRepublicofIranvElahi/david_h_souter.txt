justice
david
h.
souter
but
assuming
--
assuming
the
tribunal
takes
up
some
such
issue
as
justice
kennedy
has
mentioned,
it
will
start
with
the
assumption
that
the
cubic
judgment
is
in
fact
a
valid
judgment.
it
will
not
look
behind
the
cubic
judgment
as
such,
will
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
an
entirely
separate
proceeding.
assuming
the
cubic
judgment
has
not
been
reversed
through
the
appellate
process
that
it
is
going
through,
then
the
tribunal
will
take
the
cubic
judgment
as
it
finds
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
doesn't
it
make
it
pretty
tough
to
say
that
the
cubic
judgment
is
at
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
i
think
we
understand
that.
and
--
and
it's
clear
that
the
united
states,
in
effect,
is
taking
the
position
that
that's
all
we
need
to
bear
in
mind.
but
it
suggests
to
me
that
the
drafting
of
the
statute
did
not
go
as
far
as
it
might
have
gone
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
united
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
"at
issue"
means
related
to
--
"at
issue"
means
related
to
an
issue
in
a
separate
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
it
boils
down
to,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
means
that
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding
one
side
or
the
other
gets
the
property.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
is
not
going
to
be
the
--
what
one
side
or
the
other
gets
in
this
proceeding
is
going
to
be
a
new
judgment.
and
that
new
judgment
may
or
may
not
be
satisfied
by
dealing
with
the
prior
judgment.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
prior
judgment
is
at
issue;
it
simply
means
that
the
prior
judgment
may
be
used
to
discharge
in
an
appropriate
case
an
obligation
which
is
determined
in
the
later
proceeding.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
