chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-615,
ministry
of
defense
and
support
for
the
armed
forces
of
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
versus
elahi.
mr.
bederman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
could
have
agreed
that
they
have
a
bank
account
somewhere
and
any
amounts
would
be
set
off
by
that.
that
wouldn't
make
that
bank
account
at
issue
with
respect
to
their
claim.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
doesn't
matter
that
iran
recognizes
that
this
would
be
used
to
set
off
a
judgment
it
might
obtain,
because
you
just
said,
well
they
could
--
a
bank
account
could
be
used
to
set
it
off
and
that's
not
sufficient.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
--
that's
the
only
basis
for
your
argument?
i
thought
it
was
a
broader
suggestion
that
these
are,
to
some
extent,
substitute
assets
for
the
assets
that
are
at
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
you
--
can
you
articulate
a
general
test
in
a
sentence
or
two
about
how
you
decide
whether
particular
assets
are
at
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
bederman.
mr.
hallward-driemeier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
not
our
job
to
help
you
--
it's
not
our
job
to
help
you
in
other
tribunals.
if
a
--
if
a
judgment
is
moot,
it's
moot.
we
are
not
going
to
go
back
and
tell
the
ninth
circuit
to
revise
its
opinion
just
because
that's
helpful
to
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
is
it
your
position
that
that
--
that
is
moot?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
isn't
the
consequence
that
you
are
so
worried
about
under
the
victims
of
trafficking
and
violence
protection
act
that
this
is
going
to
hurt
your
position
by
the
tribunal,
the
same
consequence
that
is
going
to
come
from
the
fact
that
these
assets
are
blocked?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
guess
this
may
be
the
same
question
justice
breyer
asked.
i
mean,
where
do
you
cut
this
off?
you've
got
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
to
canada
that
presumably
go
to
cubic,
and
then
cubic,
you
know,
builds
a
new
facility
somewhere
with
those
proceeds
and
then
sells
it
to
somebody
else.
i
mean,
are
those
still
assets
at
issue
in
the
claims
before
the
tribunal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
kind
of
a
--
that's
a
broad
assertion.
in
other
words,
so
long
as
you
and
iran
get
together
and
say
this
asset
is
at
issue
in
a
situation
where
whether
it's
at
issue
or
not
saves
you
money
and
gives
money
to
iran,
that
seems
to
be
a
very
self-serving
legal
test.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
if
you
had
these
military
assets,
which
are
clearly
the
assets
that
are
at
issue
in
iran's
claim--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--cubic
is
worried
about
what
to
do
with
it
and
so
they
sell
them
to
the
canadians
but
they
keep
the
proceeds
in
escrow,
under
the
theory
that
look
we
may
end
up
owing
this
to
the
iranians
under
the
tribunal.
under
the
setoff,
this
may
not
be
our
assets,
which
--
i
mean
the
iranians
have
a
claim
to
these.
would
those
--
would
those
escrow
funds
be
assets
at
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
is
that
very
different
from
this
situation,
where
you
have
an
arbitration
award
saying
that
you,
cubic,
owe
the
equivalent
of
what
you
should
have
--
what
you
would
have
provided
to
iran,
if
there
hadn't
been
the
revolution?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
agreement
between
who
--
between
who--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
iran,
i
assume,
would
say,
look,
we
entered
into
this
agreement
to
take
the
place
of
what
was
at
dispute.
which
is
what
they
owed
us
because
they
didn't
ship
us
the
arms
that
we
paid
for.
i
don't
see
that
that
adds
anything
to
your
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
so
iran
says,
look,
you
are
not
going
to
ship
us
the
planes,
whatever
it
is,
you
are
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
were
not
going
to
give
us
the
money,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
we
still
have
a
dispute.
so,
i
tell
you
what,
you
are
going
to
sell
this
stuff
to
canada,
you
are
going
to
get
some
money
from
them,
and
we
have
got
an
agreement
that
that
money
is
ours.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
would
cubic
enter
into
a
contract
with
iran
to
give
them
money
if
it
wasn't
taking
the
place
of
the
money
they
owed
them
in
the
original
agreement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
know
why
it
was
pending
for
ten
years?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
stayed
because
it
was
at
issue
before
the
iranian
claims
tribunal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
point
is,
depending
on
how
it
comes
out,
once
you
give
a
argument
to
the
iranians
that
they
can
raise
with
the
claims
tribunal
that
will
affect
far
more
than
your
one
single
case.
we
--
the
argument
would
be
the
united
states
is
not
living
up
to
the
obligations
it
undertook
in
the
algiers
accords.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
provision
--
can
you
cite
me
the
provision
where
the
congress
said
put
your
thumb
on
the
scale?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
11a.
and
how
does
that
--
the
title
of
the
section
says
statutory
construction.
i
just
don't
see
what
follows
as
statutory
construction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
see
any--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
don't
see
any
problem
with
congress
telling
us
how
to
conduct
statutory
construction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
bederman,
you
have
two
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
