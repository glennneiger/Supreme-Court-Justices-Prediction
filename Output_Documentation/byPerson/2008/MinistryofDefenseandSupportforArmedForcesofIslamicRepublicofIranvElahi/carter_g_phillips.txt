mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
previous
25
or
so
minutes
has
demonstrated
one
sort
of
overarching
fact,
which
is
that
there
is
an
enormous
risk,
if
this
court
decides
to
interpret
the
language
of
this
statute
broadly,
that
it
will
easily
sweep
beyond
any
kind
of
arrangements
between
iran
and
the
united
states
in
ways
that
fundamentally,
obviously,
disadvantage
the
very
people
that
congress
clearly
intended
to
benefit
by
this
entire
statutory
scheme.
this
is
a
scheme
that
was
designed
to
provide
remedies,
recoveries,
to
the
victims
of
terrorism.
and
somehow
in
the
scheme
of
everything
that
was
discussed
in
the
first
25
or
so
minutes
of
this
argument,
the
victims
of
terrorism
are
completely
shunted
aside
on
basic
--
on
the
basis
of
very
technical
ways
of
reading
it.
but
if
we
go
back
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
is
in
the
petitioner's
brief
at
11a,
it
talks
about
"enforcement
against
property
that
is
at
issue
in
claims
against
the
united
states.
"
so
the
notion
that
we
would
focus
on
the
word
"property",
as
it
relates
to
the
tribunal
and
that
the
tribunal
has
in
front
of
it,
is
a
natural
consequence
of
the
language
of
that
provision.
and
to
me,
at
least,
the
best
way
to
look
at
the
logic
is
to
review
how
often
the
united
states
has
described
and
iran
has
described
what
was
the
property
at
issue
before
the
claims
tribunal
and
the
b/61
proceeding?
and
this
is
at
65a
of
the
joint
--
of
the
government's
brief:
"the
property
at
issue
consists
of
one
air
combat
maneuvering
range
system
and
all
necessary
subparts.
"
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
property
was
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
now--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--absolutely.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
they
would
be
because
of
the
way
the
iranians
actually
pled
this.
they
said
give
us
either
back
--
give
us
either
the
military
equipment
that
we
bought,
or
give
us
the
economic
value
of
that.
but
that's
--
and
that's
why--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
one
is
remember
precisely
what
the
arbitration
award
is.
the
arbitration
award
is
not
the
value
of
the
asset.
that
was
asked
for;
that
was
rejected
by
the
arbitrator.
the
arbitration
award
is
for
the
value
of
a
separate
contract
between
cubic
and
the
canadian
government.
you
will
recall
in
the
award,
specifically
the
arbitrator
said
with
respect
to
the
underlying
acmr
contract
with
iran,
that
was
mutually
walked
away
from
by
both
parties,
and
then
there
was
a
separate
agreement
that
was
entered
into
between
the
parties,
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
arbitration
award
saying
the
value
of
breach
of
that
secondary
agreement
is
the
part
that
serves
as
the
arbitral
award.
that
it
seems
to
me
ought
to
be
regarded
at
a
minimum
as
one
step
too
far
removed,
because
that's
not
the
property
that
is
at
issue
before
the
claims
tribunal
in
any
way
that
the
parties
are
disputing
about
it.
they
accept
that
number.
and
then--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
you
clearly
--
and
i
agree
with
you;
there
is
no
question
you
can
read
this
statute
either
way.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
first
of
all--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--a
significant
purpose
of
this
entire
exercise
obviously
is
to
provide
redress
to
the
victims
of
terrorism.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
201(d)
is
a
specific
statutory
construction
provision
which
seems
to
suggest
that
congress
says
that
if
there
are
doubts
about
how
to
apply
this
particular
provision,
you
ought
to
put
the
thumb
on
the
scale
in
favor
of
the
victim.
so
you
do
--
you
will
give
meaning
to
section
201(c)(4)
of
the
tria
if
you
adopt
a
position
consistent
with
our
position.
the
reality
is
that
given
that
there
are
two
more
lienholders
in
line,
none
of
this
has
anything
to
do
with
iran
and
with
the
way
the
tribunal
is
going
to
proceed,
because
even
if
you
were
to
say
that
dr.
elahi
is
not
entitled
to
this,
there
is
no
relinquishment
claim
with
respect
to
the
others,
so
this
money
is
never
going
back
to
iran,
under
any
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
--
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
justice
breyer--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
the
problem
with
this,
justice
breyer,
is
that
this
is
a
relinquishment
provision.
it
--
it
is
saying
to
us
in
return
for
these
limited
resources,
20
percent
of
the
judgment
--
and
that
is
only
20
percent
of
the
compensatory
judgment
and
completely
lose
the
punitive
judgment
--
in
return
for
that
you
have
to
relinquish
certain
rights;
and
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
would
not
have
adopted
the
a
provision
that
said
and
the
rights
you
relinquish
are
essentially
unknowable
under
any
circumstances
and
extend
to
the
ends
of
the
earth.
what
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
breyer--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
parties
have
been
very
specific
about
it,
and
we
cited
in
a
series
of
quotations
about
what
is
the
property
at
issue
here;
and
the
property
at
issue,
justice
breyer
is
the
acmr
system
or
the
economic
value
of
the
acmr
system.
what
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
value
of
the
cubic
judgment.
first
of
all,
there
was
an
effort
to
bring
the
cubic
judgment
specifically
before
the
tribunal,
and
it
was
rejected
as
having
no
jurisdiction,
certainly
no
jurisdiction
over
cubic
and
then
no
jurisdiction
over
the
united
states'
part
of
the
cubic
judgment
because
that
was
not
a
contract
between--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--they
did--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
that's
the
whole
point
of
this.
the
property
at
issue
before
the
tribunal
is
the
acmr
system,
and
indeed
in
1981
when
this
was
originally
brought
what
iran
wanted
was
the
acmr
system.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
breyer,
there
is
no
question
that
the
fact
that
there
are
subsequent
lienholders
in
line
affects
the
possibility,
but
i
would
have
thought
it
would
only
affect
it
in
a
way
that
is
positive
for
me.
because
iran
is
saying,
look,
this
doesn't
have
any
relevance
to
the
--
to
the
iran
tribunal
if
we
don't
ever
get
the
money;
and
the
reality
is
whether
dr.
elahi
gets
the
money
or
the
other
lienholders
get
the
money,
iran
is
never
going
to
get
the
money,
which
says
to
me
it's
not
at
issue
under
any
theory
of
the
case
in
front
of
the
u.s.
iranian
claims
tribunal.
and
so
that
would
be
my
quickest
answer
to
that;
to
the
extent
that
you
have
other
lienholders,
it
simply
means
that
there
really
is
nothing
at
issue
there.
but
it
still
seems
to
me
that
the
better
way--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
the
united
states
would
still
have
that
--
would
still
have
that
argument,
but
it's
not
a
claim
against
the
united
states,
which
is
what's
required
under
the
statute
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
when
it's
viewed
that
way.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't
think
there
is
anybody
whose
going
to
--
well,
maybe
there
is
some
sense
in
which
examining
the
cubic
judgment,
but
i
don't
think
the
tribunal
has
remotely
been
asked
to
or
will
under
any
circumstances
be
asked
to
review
the
cubic
judgment.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
i
think
there
is
no
question
these
are
for
two
different
obligations.
and
i
think
that's
why
candidly
the
court
ought
to
decide
that
this
is
not
property
at
issue
here,
because
it
is
so
clearly
unrelated
to
the
weapons
system
itself
or
to
any
monetization
of
the
weapons
system.
remember
the
cubic
judgment
comes
from
an
arbitral
award
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
that
arms
sale.
it
has
to
do
with
a
completely
separate
contractual
undertaking
between
the
cubic
and
the
canadian
government--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
iran.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know
how
there
could
be
an
argument
on
that
point,
justice
kennedy.
if
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
arbitrator,
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
the
--
that
the
underlying
agreement
between
iran
and
cubic
with
respect
to
the
arms
sale
was
mutually
terminated
by
the
parties,
and
a
new
agreement
entered
into
in
order
to
resell
those
properties
to
canada.
the
opinion
is
crystalline
in
that
regard.
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
the
violation
of
that
separate
agreement
that
the
--
that
cubic
was
then
held
to
be
liable
to
iran
for
the
$2.8
million.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
between
iran
and
cubic.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
just
says
that
you
move
even
further
down
the
road
from
what
are
the
properties
that
are,
in
fact,
at
issue
before
the
tribunal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
although
they
wanted
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
they
still
want
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
that
--
that
--
they
may
have
been
able
to
make
that
argument.
that
is
not
an
argument
they
have
made.
the
argument
they
made,
which
represents
the
property
at
issue
in
the
claims,
is
first,
give
us
back
the
arms;
and
then
two,
give
us
the
value
of
those
arms,
not
as
they
have
been
reformulated
in
a
completely
separate
contract,
give
us
the
value
of
those
arms.
it
seems
to
me
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
question
was,
they
were
going
to
try
to
go
forward
in
these
arrangements.
and
it
was
a,
you
know,
complicated
problem
because
you
couldn't
tell
whether
or
not
you
would
ever
be
able
to
send
things
back
to
iran,
et
cetera.
and
so,
they
were
perfectly
happy
to
enter
into
an
agreement
where
they
would
say,
look,
we
will
just
do
the
best
we
can
and
see
how
it
turns
out.
i
mean,
in
reality,
the
litigation
in
front
of
the
ninth
circuit,
obviously,
on
the
cubic
judgment,
cubic
is
screaming
loud
and
clear
that
they
don't
think
they
owe
a
nickel
as
a
consequence
of
this
arrangement
that
there
had
been
no
breach
of
anything
under
any
circumstances,
and
that
there
is
not
a
penny
that's
to
be
owed.
and
as
counsel
said
earlier,
it's
in
some
ways
unfortunate
that
this
has
moved
in
this
sequence.
so,
we
don't
really
have--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
was
stayed
as
a
consequence
of
this
other
litigation
--
as
a
consequence
of
these
proceedings
in
order
to
allow,
i
think
in
general
the
iran
claims
tribunal
to
--
to
sort
out,
at
least,
some
portion
of
these
issues.
it
would
obvious
be
--
i
mean,
we
have
moved
--
i
mean,
we
are
not
a
party.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
i
mean,
the
truth
is
just
as
the
issue
was
a
more
important
issue
for
the
united
states
prior
to
the
new
blocking
order,
you
know,
the
questions
that
could
potentially
have
arisen
were
potentially
more
important
to
the
claims
tribunal
at
the
outset.
as
the
litigation
has
played
out,
it
turns
out
that
there's
no
relationship
between
the
two.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
it
also
provides
protection
for
victims,
right,
and
those
are
the
people
who
are
the
most--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
breyer,
i
think
the
hague
cases
are
the
place
to
look
in
terms
of
trying
to
understand
this,
because
what
it's
what
--
hague,
that
line
of
cases
all
involve
efforts
to
seize
consular
properties
of
iran
and
all
arose
prior
to
the
accords,
and
every
one
of
those
courts
of
appeals
has
concluded
that
each
of
those
properties
is
beyond
the
ability
of
the
courts
to
attach
all
of
those
properties.
and
--
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
having
inconsistent
claims
potentially
arise
in
both
the
district
--
in
federal
court
in
the
united
states
and
in
front
of
the
claims
tribunal.
so
where
you
have
a
situation
where
the
claims
tribunal
says,
look,
that's
a
consular
property
that
belongs
to
the
iranian
government,
you
should
return
it,
and
have
the
united
states
have
to
show
up
in
front
of
that
tribunal
and
say,
oh,
excuse
me,
but
unfortunately,
we
have
been
forced
to
sell
that
property
under
a
federal
court
order
and
the
embarrassment
that
arises
from
that.
that
seems
to
me
so
clearly
what
congress
had
in
mind,
or
at
least
is
clearly
covered
by
this
and
the
case
law
or
all
the
case
law
up
to
this
point
that
has
dealt
with
it
has
consistently
ruled
in
favor
of
the
united
states
and
iran
in
that
context.
but
there
is
no
reason
to
go
beyond
that
context
in
order
to
deprive
the
clear
victims
of
terrorism
of
a
meaningful
remedy.
and
i
think,
justice
breyer,
just
to
be
clear
about
this,
we
got
money
back,
to
be
sure.
a
substantial
portion
of
the
money
we
got
back
came
from
the
values
of
the
properties
that
the
united
states
seized
from
iran
that
they've
used,
they
have
leased
out
embassies
and
stuff
like
that.
and
that
is
not
property
that
comes
out
of
the
united
states'
fisc.
so
it's
not
reasonable
to
assume,
as
the
government
does,
that
simply
because
these
moneys
were
paid
out,
that
there
is
some
huge
relinquishment
that
is
required
there.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
makes
much
more
sense
for
this
court
to
narrowly
construe
this.
i
guess
the
last
thing
i
would
say
in
that
regard
is,
that
insofar
as
we
can
tell,
this
case
will
affect
one
party
--
actually,
i
guess
the
other
two
lienholders
behind
us.
but
realistically,
there
are
no
cases
in
the
pipeline.
there
is
no
other
litigation
that
is
on
going
out
there.
this
is
a
singular
--
i
mean,
it's
kind
of
unusual
for
this
court,
but
this
is
the
only
case
that
we
can
figure
that
this
applies
to.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
--
i
understand
why
the
government
filed
in
support
of
certiorari
at
the
earlier
stages
of
this
proceeding.
but
after
the
intervening
blocking
order
that
takes
the
--
i
mean,
that
issue
is
off
the
table.
we
are
no
longer
defending
the
ninth
circuit's
view
that
the
united
states
breached
the
original
algiers
accords
in
the
context
of
this
case.
nothing
in
the
blocking
order
that
is
in
place
now
and
would
prevent
iran
from
getting
this
remotely
violates
the
algiers
accords.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
no
one
is
making
that
argument
at
this
stage.
so
all
you
have
is
a
relatively
clean
--
issues.
does
the
blocking
order
apply
here
in
stopping
the
payment
of
these
funds
to
iran?
there
the
answer
seems
to
me
unquestionably
yes.
and
then
the
second
question
is,
do
we
adopt
a
rule
to
the
detriment
to
a
single
terrorist
victim
in
a
way
that
deprives
him
of
an
opportunity
to
get
back
fair
redress
in
the
absence
of
some
clear
indication
from
congress
that
it
intended
that
result
where
it
would
affect
no
one
else
and
where
congress
has
said
specifically
in
a
rule
of
construction,
put
your
thumb
on
the
scale
in
favor
of
the
victim
of
terrorism?
that's
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
in
this
case.
it
provides
no
problems
to
the
united
states
in
its
claims
tribunal
litigation.
it's
only
an
issue
of
money.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
it's
201(d)(4),
the
petitioner's
brief
at
11a.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
what
you
have
to
do
is
give
the
language
some
credit.
and
our
way
--
what
we
think
congress
intended
there
was
to
say,
tip
the
scale
in
favor
of
the
victims
of
terrorism,
which
is
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
statute.
i
will
confess,
the
language
is
not
nearly
as
clear
as
i
would
like
it
to
be,
but
i
will
also
recognize
that
the
--
the
government
of
iran's
position
renders
that
language
as
total
dead
letter--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--alternative
it
seems
to
me
you
ought
to
give
it
--
again,
give
the
tie
to
the
victims
under
this--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
i
think
congress
does
--
is
entitled
to
suggest,
if
it's
--
if
you
have
ambiguity
in
our
language,
which
way
to
come
out
as
a
matter
of
policy.
no,
i
don't
think
that's
--
no,
i
don't
think
that's
dictating
--
that's
certainly
not
dictating
a
result
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
mean
in
the
situations
where
the
united
states
has
subrogate
--
right
to
subrogation?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
it
would
almost
certainly
work
as
a
matter
of
diplomacy
and
not
as
a
matter
of
adjudicated
resolution.
i
think
what
they
will
say
is,
these
are
rights,
these
are
amounts
of
money
that
we
have
had
to
pay.
and
if
we
are
ever
to
normalize
relations
with
the
government
of
iran,
we
are
going
to
expect
the
government
of
iran
to
recognize
those
payments
and
to
make
some
kind
of
retribution
to
the
united
states
under
those
circumstances.
and
again,
all
it
does
is
it
shifts
the
burden
of
these
injuries
from
the
victims,
who
are
in
the
least
best
position
to
deal
with
them,
and
put
them
in
the
united
states,
which
is
in
a
position
of
at
least
some
hope
of
being
able
to
resolve
them
diplomatically
in
a
way
that
the
united
states
can,
in
fact,
be
recompensed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
are,
but
the
problem
is
you
have
to
back
into
the
situation
of
property
that
is
at
issue
in
the
claims
tribunal.
the
claims
tribunal
was
created
in
'81.
it's
not
a
lot
of
that
property
around.
we're
talking
25
years
later.
so,
they
have
pretty
much
played
out
their
course.
there
were
the
hague
noted
cases,
and
the
elahi
case.
the
others
are
going
to
be
resolved
without
regard
to
these
provisions.
and
so,
the
reality
is
what
the
court
says
today
will
affect
my
client,
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
no
one
else.
and
certainly,
the
only
interest
the
united
states
has
at
this
stage
in
this
litigation
is
its
own
financial
interest.
and
it
would
seem
to
me,
that's
not
a
basis
on
which
to
interpret
the
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
urge
the
court
to
affirm.
