justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
going
to
ask
that
question.
in
other
words,
there
are
cases
or
at
least
it
is
contemplated
that
there
will
be
cases
under
the
rules,
where
the
iran-u.s.
claims
tribunal
does
determine
that
there
should
or
should
not
be
an
offset.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
going
back
to
the
main
issue,
the
only
reason
that
this
is
at
issue
before
the
iran
tribunal
is
because
it
might
be
a
setoff
in
the
event
of
judgment
in
favor
of
iran?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
how
is
that
affected
--
how
is
that
affected
depending
on
whether
or
not
the
judgment
is
executed
or
not.
would
the
iran
tribunal
have
the
authority
to
order
cubic
not
to
satisfy
the
judgment,
but
to
just
hold
the
funds?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
that
it's
the
subject
of
the
award.
and
it's
really
not
at
issue;
it's
just
recognizing
that
there
has
been
some
prior
transaction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
iran
might
say
in
the
tribunal,
in
responding
to
the
setoff
argument,
this
claim
that
we
brought
against
you,
the
united
states,
implicates
a
breach
of
obligations
that
you
have
that
are
un
--
somewhat
unrelated
to
what
was
at
issue
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
cubic
judgment.
and
then
the
united
states
would
say,
no,
that's
not
true.
so
they
would
have
to
examine
the
cubic
judgment.
so
that
means
it's
at
issue
before
the
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
might
be
in
the
setoff
proceedings.
there
might
--
there
might
be
an
argument
that
there
are
two
obligations,
and
there
is
a
setoff
or
that
there
is
a
setoff.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
we
might
get--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--substantial
--
a
substantial
degree
of
argument
on
that
point.
