mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
does
not
appear
here
today
in
support
of
iran,
but,
rather,
in
defense
of
critical
interests
of
the
united
states
before
the
united
states
--
iran
claims
tribunal.
in
particular,
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
united
states
never
unblocked
iranian
military
assets
after
the
algiers
accords
is
directly
contrary
to
the
position
of
the
united
states
before
the
tribunal,
and
iran
immediately
indicated
that
it
would
use
that
holding
against
the
united
states
and
in
support
of
its
multimillion-dollar--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor,
there
is
now
a
new
and
independent
reason
why
the
asset
is
blocked.
and,
in
fact,
respondent
no
longer
defends
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
basis.
it
is,
we
wish
to
emphasize,
essential
that
this
court
vacate
that
holding
and
indicate
that
it
is
no
longer
legally
valid
so
that
it
is
not
--
that
erroneous
holding
is
not
used
against
us
in
support
of
iran's
two-million-dollar
claim.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
we
--
we
think
that
the
court
would
not.
it
would
vacate
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
would
be
helpful
certainly
to
the
united
states
if
the
court
emphasized
the
natural
fact
that
that
would
mean
that
the
court
of
appeals'
erroneous
holding
was
not
any
longer
legally--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--no.
the
--
the
court
would
vacate
the
decision,
certainly.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
it
is
our
position
that
the
--
because
respondent
has
relinquished
his
right
to
attach
these
assets,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
vacated.
and
that
would
have
the
affect
of
rendering
inoperative
that
erroneous
--
the
other
erroneous
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
blocked
assets.
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
--
and
we
agree
with
respondent
on
this
point
--
that
as
of
now,
because
of
the
october,
2007,
designation,
the
property
of
petitioner
is
blocked
and
subject
to
attachment
under
tria.
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
need
for
further
proceedings
on
that.
the
secretary
of
state
designated
the
ministry
of
defense
of
iran,
and
the
position
of
petitioner
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand
from
this
court
was
that
it
is
the
ministry
of
defense
of
iran,
a
central
core
constituent
part
of
the
iranian
state,
that
is
the
entity
that
was
designated.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
elahi,
respondent
elahi,
could
get
it
if
he
had
not
relinquished
his
rights
to
attach--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--assets
at
issue
before
the
tribunal.
as
of
right
now,
the
asset
is
blocked
and
iran
could
not
repatriate
it,
as
of
right
now.
of
course,
blocking
orders
can
be
amended,
but
as
of
right
now
it
is
frozen
and
petitioner
cannot
repatriate
it.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
your
honor,
again,
the
blocking
order
is
the
present
status
of
the
assets.
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
could
not
later
be
repatriated
to
petitioner;
whereas,
execution
by
respondent
against
the
assets
would
mean
that
they
would
be
forever
denied
to
petitioner.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
you
are
right,
your
honor,
that
is
the
position
of
the
united
states.
and
earlier
your
honor
quoted
language
from
the
oral
argument
of
the
united
states
that
the
--
or
maybe
it
was
one
of
our
briefs
--
that
the
cubic
judgment
is
--
that
the
tribunal
doesn't
have
to--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that
is
in
the
context
of
our
saying
that,
whether
or
not
--
in
the
view
of
the
united
states,
whether
or
not
petitioner
ever
collects
that
money,
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
an
offset,
and
in
fact,
we
believe
it's
a
complete
defense
to
iran's
claim.
of
course,
petitioner's
argument
--
or
iran's
argument
before
the
tribunal
is
that
it
is
--
that
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
a
reduction
of
liability
only
if
iran
actual
receives
the
assets.
and
that's
why
the
language
of
the
statute
is
written
more
broadly
when
the
litigation
before
the
tribunal
is
ongoing.
at
that
point
any
property
that
is
at
issue
before
the
tribunal
is
not
subject
to
attachment
by
one
who
has
relinquished,
and
that's
because
this
court
nor
any
other
lower
court
in
the
united
states
is
supposed
to
pre-judge
the
merits
of
those
respective
positions.
iran's
position
--
and
it's
on
page
85a
of
the
united
states'
appendix
--
is
that
the
awarded
amount,
unless
received
by
iran,
cannot
be
offset
against
any
relief
which
the
united
states
may
be
found
to
owe
iran.
so
that
is
iran's
position.
that
is
at
issue
before
the
tribunal.
the
respondent
would
have
the
court
believe
that
the
proceedings
in
the
tribunal
are
in
the
nature
of
an
in
rem
proceeding,
that
it's
a
property
dispute.
they
use
that
term
repeatedly
in
the
brief,
"a
property
dispute".
but
that
is
not
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
in
the
tribunal.
iran
has
asserted
a
claim
that
the
united
states
violated
its
obligations
under
the
algiers
accords.
the
remedy
it
seeks
is,
and
i
quote
--
this
is
from
--
excuse
me
--
from
the
--
let's
see
--
the
remedy
they
seek
--
they
seek
is
the
value
of
the
cubic
sale
to
canada.
they
have
said
that
in
the
state
--
in
iran's
reply
in
statement
--
claim
16
that
respondent
relies
upon,
they
say
that
the
remedy
they
seek
is
not
the
asset
itself.
of
course,
the
asset
had
been
dissipated
before
iran
ever
filed
a
statement
of
claim
against
the
united
states.
the
remedy
is
the
proceeds
of
that
sale
to
canada.
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
to
canada,
which
are
the
subject
of
iran's
claim
against
the
united
states
in
the
tribunal,
have
been
reduced
to
judgment
in
the
cubic
judgment.
that--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
i
believe
that
in
fact
the
language
of
the
statute
makes
it
--
the
assertions
of
the
parties
before
the
tribunal
that
define
the
property
that
is
at
issue
before
the
tribunal.
that,
again,
is
so
that
the
courts
are
not
put
in
a
position
of
adjudicating,
prejudging,
the
merits
of
the
parties'
arguments
before
the
tribunal.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
needs
to
consider
what
the
outer
reaches
are.
in
this
case,
this
is
--
iran
characterizes
it,
and
this
is
at
page,
again,
at
page
85
of
the
u.s.
appendix,
that
the
cubic
judgment,
quote
"constitutes
an
integral
part
of
the
remedy
sought
in
case
b/61.
"
this
isn't
an
offset
or
a
counterclaim.
justice
ginsburg,
you
previously
alluded
to
the
fact
the
united
states
did
not
file
a
counterclaim.
and
that's
because
this
is
not
some
unrelated
counterclaim
the
united
states
has
against
iran.
this
is
a
critical
part
of
iran's
claim
against
the
united
states.
it
defeats,
in
the
view
of
the
united
states,
iran's
claim
entirely.
at
the
very
least,
it
reduces
the
amount
of
iran's
claim
against
the
united
states.
this
isn't
somehow
unrelated;
we're
asserting,
well,
we
can
use
this
as
an
offset
because
you
also
owe
us
money
from
something
else.
this
is
in
iran's
own
statement,
and
this
is
the
statement
that
you--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i
--
i
don't
know.
cubic
is
not
before
the
tribunal.
but
what
we
can
ask
is,
can
we
conceive
of
--
and
i
think
it's
relatively
easy
to
conceive
of
--
an
award
of
the
tribunal
that
says,
the
united
states
owes
iran
$2.8
million;
if
the
cubic
judgment
is
received
by
iran,
the
united
states
owes
iran
nothing.
and
clearly,
in
that
circumstance,
the
cubic
judgment
is
the
subject
of
the
award
of
the
tribunal.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i
guess,
your
honor,
you
have
to
think
what
does
it
mean
for
any
property
--
property
to
be
at
issue
before
the
tribunal
or
the
subject
of
the
award?
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--if
i
may
respond.
your
honor,
on
that
view,
even
the
acmr
is
not
at
issue
before
the
tribunal,
because
the
tribunal
cannot
order
the
united
states
to
hand
over
the
acmr
to
iran.
in
the
a/15
judgment
to
which
petitioner's
counsel
alluded
earlier,
the
tribunal
recognized
that
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
united
states'
obligations
under
the
algiers
accords
not
to
issue
an
export
license.
therefore,
iran--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--is
not
entitled
to
the
acmr.
it's
entitled
to
its
loss,
and
its
loss
has
been
reduced
to
judgment
in
the
cubic
judgment.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
thank
you,
your
honor.
