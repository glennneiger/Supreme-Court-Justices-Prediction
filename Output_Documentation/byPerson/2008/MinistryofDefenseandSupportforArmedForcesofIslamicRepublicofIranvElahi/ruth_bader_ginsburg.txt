justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
united
states
at
some
stage
told
the
tribunal
in
the
hague
that
the
cubic
judgment
--
and
now
i'm
quoting
--
"has
nothing
to
do
with
matters
before
the
international
tribunal.
"
"nothing
to
do
with".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
no
counterclaim
stated
before
the
tribunal
as
of
this
moment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
no
counterclaim
in
the
case
before
the
tribunal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
explain
to
me
why
it
would
effect
the
relief?
because
suppose
iran
doesn't
get
the
proceeds
of
the
cubic
judgment,
but
instead
a
creditor
of
iran,
in
this
case
elahi,
a
creditor
gets
it.
it
should
still
be
--
you've
paid
the
--
iran's
bill.
iran
owes
money
to
x.
why
shouldn't
the
united
states
equally
get
the
credit
whether
the
cubic
judgment
in
the
end
is
pocketed
by
iran
or
by
iran's
creditor,
elahi?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
--
something
that
i
would
just
like
clarification
on.
you
mentioned
that
the
cubic
judgment
is
on
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit.
it
has
been
on
appeal
since
june
of
'98?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
are
cross
appeals.
what
are
the
positions
taken
about
that
judgment
by
the
respective
sides,
and
why
is
it
pending
for
ten
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
--
let's
assume
that
the
--
that
iran
is
able
to
execute
on
the
cubic
judgment.
could
it
take
the
proceeds
out
of
the
united
states,
given
the
2007
blocking
order?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mentioned
--
you
mentioned
that
there
were
other
claimants
or
others
--
others
who
would
like
to
execute--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--other
lienors
--
other
attachments.
and
so,
you
said
in
the
end
--
well
--
well,
what
would
be
the
effect
of
those
other
liens?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
saying
that.
isn't
that
--
that
issue
is
moot?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
we
--
if
we
took
the
position
that
you
are
expressing
about
what
is
at
issue,
we
would
never
reach
the
second
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
correctly
that
that
means
that
because
it's
a
blocked
asset,
then
dr.
elahi
can
get
it,
but
iran
itself
couldn't
get
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
wouldn't
the
united
states
get
credit
for
that,
too,
on
the
theory
that
i
suggested
before?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
matters
before
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not?
i
mean,
the
question
i
raised
before,
why
wouldn't
the
united
states
be
urging
that
it
gets
credit,
whether
iran
gets
the
money
or
whether
the
people
who
are
creditors
of
iran
get
the
money.
in
either
case,
the
united
states
should
be
able
to
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
phillips,
one
piece
of
--
i
don't
--
you
have
agreed
that
the
united
states
could
recoup
from
iran
the
amount
paid
to
the
victims,
including
dariush
elahi,
including
the
2.3
million.
how
would
the
united
states
go
about
recouping
from
iran
the
money
it
has
paid
to
the
victims
of
iran's
terrorism?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
how
would
that
work?
how
would
--
how
would
the
united
states--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
said
this
is
a
one
of
a
kind
case.
are
there
no
other
victims
who
have
successfully
sued
iran?
