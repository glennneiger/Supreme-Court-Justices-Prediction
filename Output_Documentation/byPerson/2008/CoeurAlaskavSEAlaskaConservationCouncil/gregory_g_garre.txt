mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
expert
agencies
charged
by
congress
with
implementing
the
clean
water
act
have
concluded
that
the
discharge
of
fill
material,
like
the
mine
tailings
at
issue
in
this
case,
should
be
permitted
by
the
army
corps
of
engineers
under
section
404
of
the
act,
and
are
not
--
are
not
subject
to
the
effluent
guidelines
applicable
to
permits
issued
by
the
epa
under
section
402
of
the
act.
that
interpretation
is
grounded
on
more
than
3
decades
of
agency
pronouncements
and
reflects
the
collective
judgment
and
expertise
of
the
army
corps
of
engineers
and
the
epa
in
administering
the
act.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
justice
kennedy,
it's
always
one
or
the
other.
the
clean
water
act
establishes
two
distinct
permitting
regimes.
and
i
think
this
is
actually
something
where
the
parties
agree.
either
it's
going
to
be
permitted
under
section
402
of
the
act,
which
covers
pollutants
generally
but
not
the
discharge
of
dredged
material,
or
fill
material,
which
is
covered
by
section
404
of
the
act.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
as
a
practical
matter,
for
example,
if
you
take
the
--
the
slurry
in
this
case,
which
is
55
percent
solid
by
volume,
there
is
going
to
be
liquid
coming
out
of
that
pipe
with
the
slurry,
but
under
--
under
the
definition
that
the
agencies
administer
of
"fill
material",
this
is
fill
material
under
that
definition.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
fill
material
trumps
effluent.
that's--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--sure,
justice
souter.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
i
think
those
concerns
really
go
to
the
definition
of
seacc
has
squarely
challenged
that
definition
in
this
case.
and
i
would
point
you
to
two
parts
of
the
record
to--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--sure.
and
let
me
just
point
to
the
two
parts
of
the
record:
the
ja
at
541
note
12,
where
the
ninth
circuit
acknowledged
they
didn't
challenge
it;
and
then
also
i'd
point
you
to
their
complaint,
where
the
complaint
is
directed
to
the
permits
and
does
not
seek
a
determination
that
the
fill
rule
definition
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
we
think
that
that
definition
reflects
the
settled
understanding
and
expertise
of
both
agencies,
the
army
corps
of
engineers--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
by
2002.
they
adopted
this
rule.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
the
--
the
epa
has
always
adopted
and
applied
an
effects
test
for
determining
whether
or
not
a
discharge
is
fill
material--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--there
was
a
period,
of
course,
justice
ginsburg
--
you're
right
--
where
the
army
corps
of
engineers
adopted
a
primary
purpose
test.
during
that
period
--
you're
right
--
404
permits
were
not
--
were
not
issued
for
the
discharge
of
things
where
the
purpose
was
not
to
fill
the
lake;
it
was
to
dispose
of
material.
now,
during
that
period,
though,
those
discharges
were
not
regulated
under
section
402
of
the
act
and
under
section
306,
the
effluent
guidelines,
but
for
a
different
reason.
the
reason
why
they
weren't
regulated
under
402
during
that
period
is
because
of
the
agencies'
wastewater
treatment
exception,
which
is
found
at
40
c.f.r.
122.2,
where
the
agencies
excepted
from
the
definition
of
"the
waters
of
the
united
states.
"
discharges
into
an
impoundment
area.
and
what
you
have
going
on
here
is
the
discharge
of
fill
material
into
an
impoundment
area,
which
is
dammed
off
with
a
50-foot
dam.
those
discharges,
in
this
case,
are
governed
by
section
404
of
the
act.
but
any
discharges
from
that
impoundment
area
into
downstream
waters
of
the
united
states
are
subject
to
section
402
of
the
act
--
there's
a
separate
permit
in
this
case
--
and
are
subject
to
the
effluent
guidelines
and
the
new
source
performance
standards.
so
you
have
those
two.
the
agencies
have
come
together.
they've
reconciled
the
statutory
regimes,
and
they
have
the
404
permit
of
dredged
material,
material
that's
going
to
fill
the
bottom
of
the
lake,
raise
it
by
50
feet,
governed
by
section
404
of
the
act.
that
impoundment
area
then
is
sealed
off,
and
any
discharged
material
out
of
that
impoundment
area
into
waters
of
the
united
states
is
going
to
be
governed
by
402
and
the
separate
effluent
guidelines
there.
that--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
any
--
we're
talking
about--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
let
me
address
that
in
two
different
ways.
first
of
all,
at
the
end
of
this
project,
when
this
lake
is
going
to
be
reclaimed,
the
agencies
determined
that
it's
going
to
be
environmentally
as
sound,
if
not
superior,
for
the
habitats
in
alaska,
fish
and
wildlife.
so
at
the
end
of
the
project,
it
is
going
to
be--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--the
statute
refers
to
specified
disposal
sites,
and
what
you
--
what
you
have
here
--
you're
right
--
is
a
lake.
but
it's
impounded
by
a
50-foot
dam.
the
other
part
i
wanted
to
point
to
is
the
section
404
guidelines
are
rigorous
environmental
guidelines
that
address
a
number
of
different
concerns,
including
the
quality
of
the
water,
the
fish
and
wildlife
habitat.
and
at
the
end
of
that
process,
you've
got
the
epa,
which
has
the
right
to
exercise
a
veto
over
any--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
true.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
that's
true,
justice
souter,
but
--
but
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
reason
why
the
lake
--
the
fish
in
the
lake
are
not
going
to
survive
is
because
of
the
fill
effect
of
the
material,
not
because
of
the
--
any
toxics
put
into
the
water.
and
that's--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--going
to
be
the
case--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--at
any
time
you
have
fill
material
going
into
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
of
course,
section
404
doesn't
apply
until
you've
got
fill
material
going
into
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
what
the
agencies
have
done
to
reconcile
their
definitions
is
to
apply
this
effects
test.
now,
if
coeur
alaska
sought
to
fill
the
entire
lake--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
think
that's
correct.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
the
legal
effect
is
to
regulate
that
pollution
under
section
404.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
the
primary
environmental
alternative
considered
was
a
dry
tailings
alternative.
and
that
would
be
been
problematic
in
two
different
ways.
one,
it
would
have
required
the
destruction
of
some
100
acres
of
wetlands.
and
two,
it
would
have
resulted
in
enormous
stacks
of
tailings,
100
to
200-feet
high,
thousands
of
feet
wide,
that
would
actually
dwarf
the
pentagon
and
be
visible
from
nearby
berners
bay.
now,
the
army
corps
of
engineers,
the
state
of
alaska,
and
the
forest
service
determined
that
the
wet
tailings
option,
putting
the
tailings
into
a
lake,
reclaiming
that
lake
so
that
it
would
be
environmentally
superior,
was
the
preferable
option.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
if
this
court
has
any
doubt
about
the
statutory
text,
the
regulatory
decisions
here
go
back
more
than
30
years.
in
1973,
the
epa
adopted
a
rule
that
said
that
the
discharge
of
fill
material
is
not
regulated
under
the
section
402
permitting
system.
in
2002,
in
the
preamble
to
the
fill
rule,
the
agency
made
clear
again
epa
has
never
regulated
the
discharge
of
fill
material
under
the
effluent
guidelines.
and--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--not
the
environmental
protection
agency.
the
environmental
protection
agency,
since
the
passage
of
the
clean
water
act,
has
taken
the
position
that
discharge
that
has
the
effect
of
changing
the
bottom
elevation
of
a
water
is
going
to
be
fill.
and
that
makes
sense
as
a
practical
matter.
the
agencies
with
30
years
of
experience
determined
that
the
--
the
purpose
definition
that
the
corps
had
adopted
for
a
period
was
unworkable,
unpredictable,
and
didn't
make
sense.
and
i
think
that
if
there's
any
judgment
that
courts
ought
to
defer
to
here,
it's
the
judgment
of
the
agencies
based
on
their
collective
experience
as
to
the
proper
definition
of
"fill
material".
that--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
you
put
discharge
into
a
river,
it
may
not
change
the
bottom
elevation.
that
wouldn't
be
fill
material.
but,
justice
ginsburg,
there
have
been
a
number
of
hypotheticals
raised
by
respondents
here.
let
me
address
those.
the
section
404
process
is
a
rigorous
environmental
process.
the
epa
does
have
veto
authority.
we
haven't
seen
these
problems
at
all
in
the
6
years
that
the
fill
definition
has
been
in
place,
and
i
think
it's
simply
untenable
to
suggest
that
these
standards
--
which,
in
section
4,
require
water
quality
determinations,
wildlife,
aquatic
determinations
--
would
result
in
the
sort
of
environmental
harm
that
respondents
have
hypothesized.
and
the
prospect
of
that
harm
is
no
basis
for
this
court
to
override
the
statutory
scheme
that
congress
created
with
two
distinct
permitting
regimes,
one
for
fill
material,
one
for
other
pollutants,
and
to
override
the
agencies'
pronouncements,
interpretations
for
more
than
30
years.
and
the
other
agency
document
i
wanted
to
point
to
is
very
important.
it's
the
2004
mine
tailings
memorandum,
which
is
contained
at
ja
141
to
146.
in
that
memorandum,
which
is
a
2004
memo
by
the
heads
of
the
epa
water
divisions,
they
explain
the
application
of
the
statutory
and
the
regulatory
scheme
to
these
types
of
discharges.
discharges
of
fill
material
into
the
impoundment
is
going
to
be
subject
to
404
and
the
rigorous
process
there.
any
discharges
out
of
that
impoundment
area
is
going
to
be
subject
to
the
rigorous
requirements
of
402.
and
that
agency
interpretation
is
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
your
honor.
