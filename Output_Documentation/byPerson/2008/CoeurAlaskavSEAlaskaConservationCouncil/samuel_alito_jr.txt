justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
general
garre,
i
don't
want
to
take
up
your
rebuttal
time,
but
what
was
--
what's
the
environmental
alternative
to
what
was
done
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
standard
has
to
be
--
the
standard
has
to
be
applicable,
and
this
is
an
epa
regulation,
isn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
the
epa
has
said
this
isn't
applicable
to
this
situation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
your
--
your
position
requires
us
to
determine
that
epa's
interpretation
of
those
--
the
statutory
regime
that
you
are
talking
about,
306
and
402,
is
--
is
contrary
to
the
statute.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
epa
were
to
amend
the
performance
standard
to
say
that
it
doesn't
apply
in
the
situation
in
which
the
fill
rule
applies,
would
that
be
a
valid
regulation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
it's
both,
who
gets
to
--
do
you
agree
that
there
can
be
only
one
permit;
there
can't
be
a
402
and
a
404
permit?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
let's
--
let's
change
that.
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
new
source
performance
standard
was
not
a
total
prohibition?
what
if
there
was
an
effluent
limitation
in
there,
so
that
a
permit
could
be
issued,
provided
that
there
was
compliance
with
the
effluent
limitation?
now,
who
issues
the
permit?
and
--
and
i
repeat,
you
--
i
understand
it's
your
position
that
there
can't
be
both
a
402
and
a
404
permit.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
statute--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
where
--
where
there's
a
situation
where
possibly
there
could
be
a
402
and
a
404
permit,
the
402
permit
trumps
the
404
permit?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
wouldn't
be
an
operation
in
violation
of
a
performance
standard.
there
would
be
a
performance
standard.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
could
be
put
in
a
402
--
it
could
be
put
in
a
402
permit.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
402
doesn't
make
any
application
for
--
for
the
404
regulations.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
does
it
make
the
--
where
does
it
make
provision
for
application
of
the
standards
that
should
apply
to
fill
under
404?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
does
the
statute
say
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
does
it
say
that?
you
say
that
there
can't
be
two
permits,
and
you
say
402
trumps
404.
and
i'm
asking
where
in
the
statute
does
it
say
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
wasn't
there
a
decision
in
the
lower
courts
that
the
alternative
was
unacceptable
as
well?
and
would
you
represent
that
if
the
case
were
remanded,
that
would
not
be
your
position
on
remand
and
creating
this--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--it
was
never
your
position
that
that
was
unacceptable?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
was
never
your
client's
position
that
creating
this
--
permanently
destroying
wetlands
and
creating
a
mound
that
was
bigger
than
the
pentagon
was
an
unacceptable
solution
to
this--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--isn't
that
the
--
isn't
that
the
p
h
at
the
point
where
it's
discharged,
and
not
the
general
p
h
in
the
lake?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
was
the
answer
--
what's
the
answer
to
the
question?
when
--
once
it's
released
into
the
lake,
what's
the
p
h
of
the
lake
as
opposed
to
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--within
how
long?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
p
h
--
so
the
p
h
you
just
cited
was
the
--
was
the
p
h--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--just
at
the
point
of
the
discharge?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
it's
95
percent
solid
but
there's
an
effluent
limitation,
your
position
is
that
there
can't
be
a
404
permit;
it
has
to
be
a
402
permit.
