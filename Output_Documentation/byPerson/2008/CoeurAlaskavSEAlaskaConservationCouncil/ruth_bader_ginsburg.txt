how
could
it
be
settled,
because
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
a
fact
that,
before
2002,
if
the
primary
purpose
was
disposing
of
waste,
that
the
402
permit
applies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
not
any
30
years'
experience,
and
when
it
was
disposing
of
waste,
it
was
under
402
until
2002.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
fact,
was
--
was
there
ever
a
permit
by
the
corps
of
engineers
when
the
purpose
was
disposal
of
waste?
was
there
ever
a
404
permit,
rather
than
a
402,
for
disposal
of
what
they
call
process
wastewater
or
wastewater?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
weren't
they
then
thinking
of
fill
material
as
material
that
was
used
either
to
fill
in,
to
reclaim
land,
or
in
a
construction
project?
i
mean,
to
call
filling
the
lake,
to
call
that
a
fill,
when
what
it's
doing
is
providing
a
disposal
place
for
a
mining
operation,
is
not
what
one
ordinarily
thinks
of
as
a
filling
operation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one
question
that
--
that
justice
souter
raised
and,
before
you
sit
down,
i
would
like
to
get
your
answer,
and
that
is,
can
anything,
any
water
of
the
united
states
that
the
corps
of
engineers
decides
is
appropriate
to
be
used
as
a
disposal
place
--
can
any
waterway
be
a
settling
pond?
that
is,
here
we
have
a
lake.
and
is
it
--
is
it
just
up
to
the
corps
of
engineers?
if
they
say
this
is
a
settling
pond,
it's
a
settling
pond?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
--
the
definition
that
was
adopted,
if
i
have
it
right,
was
the
epa
definition.
that
was
the
effects.
and
it
was
the
corps
that
had
the
purpose
test.
and
yet,
until
2002,
if
i
understand
correctly,
if
the
only
reason
of
raising
the
elevation
of
the
lake
was
to
dispose
of
waste,
you
didn't
get
a
404
permit.
that
was
not
a
404
situation
until
2002.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
application,
that
never
included
filling
a
lake,
raising
the
elevation
of
a
lake
simply
for
the
purpose
of
disposing
of
waste.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
do
we
know
that
the
life
will
ever
be
restored?
i
mean,
that's
a
guess.
nobody
knows.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
with--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
description
of
that
effect?
the
other
solution,
we
were
told,
would
involve
filling
in
a
vast
expanse
of
wetlands
and
then
having
these
huge
piles
that
could
be
seen
by
all
the
tourist
boats.
