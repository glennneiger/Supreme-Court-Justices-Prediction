chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
07-984,
coeur
alaska
v.
the
southeast
alaska
conservation
council,
and
case
07-990,
alaska
v.
the
southeast
alaska
conservation
council.
general
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
legal
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
what
is
the
physical
answer?
can
a
pipe
both
emit
sludge,
fill,
and
effluent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
they
--
could
they
veto
it
due
to
its
failure
to
comply
with
effluent
limitations?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
waldo.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
the
provision
that
authorizes
permits
begins
by
saying,
"except
as
provided
in
sections
1328
and
1344.
"
and
1344
is
404.
so
why
doesn't
that
just
take
the
404
regime
completely
out
of
what
you
were
just
talking
about?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
--
the
discharges
we're
talking
about
have
to
be
discharges
of
--
of
effluent.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
question
is,
does
it
apply
to
solids?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess,
i
mean,
does
suspended
solids
mean
there's
some
liquid
involved?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
like
the
discharge
here.
now,
i
think
mr.
olson
said
these
are
55
percent
solid
by
volume.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
a
point
at
which
it's
proper
to
speak
of
it
as
a
solid
rather
than
a
suspended
solid?
i
mean,
90
percent
by
weight
or
by
volume,
whichever
it
is,
solid?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
wouldn't
think
something
that's
90
percent
solid
is
wastewater?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
they
were
just
putting
whatever
it
is
that
doesn't
have
any
water,
concrete,
into
this
lake,
then
you
agree
that
it
would
be
just
the
corps
of
engineers
through
the
fill
--
fill
provisions
that
would
govern
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
so
if
they
chop
up
the
concrete
and
put
a
little
water
in
so
that
it's
easier
to
move,
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
comes
under
402
and
the--
epa's
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
i'm
just
curious
how
that
makes
any
sense,
since
we're
talking
about
putting
something
into
water.
i
mean,
does
it
really
matter
whether
you
add
the
water
before
it
goes
into
the
lake
or
just
the
lake
adds
the
water
when
you
put
in
the
solid?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
either
way,
i
guess
your
friends
on
the
other
side
would
argue,
i
assume,
that
it's
properly
regarded
as
fill
material,
because
that
is
the
effect
of
it,
rather
than
as
effluent
subject
to
402.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
when
they
--
even
when
they
fill
--
even
when
they
fill
a
lake?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
when
epa
regulates
--
or
it
has
regulated
these
for
40
years,
which
i
assume
is
up
to
2002
--
then
it
--
it's
because
they
don't
go
into
lakes;
it's
because
they
go
into
settling
ponds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
are
not
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
new
regulation
says
that
epa
does
not
regulate
it
when
it
goes
into
--
i
can
understand
why
the
army
corps
of
engineers
doesn't
care
if
it's
an
impoundment
pond
or
a
settling
pond,
but
they
do
care
when
it's
a
lake.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
fill
material,
as
defined
in
the
2002
regulation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--which
--
i'm
sorry.
which
fill
rule?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
you're
talking
about
the
preamble.
i'm
looking
at
the
definition
of
7a
and
8a
of
the
government's
brief.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
applicable
definition,
not
the
preamble.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
the
fish.
there
are
a
thousand
fish
in
this
lake.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
those
aren't
endangered
fish.
there
are
millions
of
them
somewhere
else.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
--
is
there
any
aquatic
life
in
this
lake
other
than
the
thousand
fish?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
microinvertebrae?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
follow
up,
that's
--
that's
the
same
point,
though,
that
justice
alito
made.
you're
testing
that
right
as
it
comes
out,
not
as
it's
diluted
in
the
lake.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
you.
i
thought
you
said
that
the
toxicity
in
the
slurry
was
tested
and
killed
99
or
whatever
percent
of
these
invertebrates.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
go
ahead.
finish
your
thought.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
waldo.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
olson,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-984,
coeur
alaska,
inc.
versus
southeast
alaska
conservation
council
and
the
consolidated
case.
