if
the
discharge
comes
from
a
single
pipe,
is
it
always
one
or
the
other,
or
can
it
ever
be
both
fill
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
happens
if
the
agencies
disagree
as
to
whether
it's
fill?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
corps
says
it's
fill;
epa
says
it
isn't.
can
the
epa
then
veto
it
on
that
ground?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
are
still
going
to
be
cases,
i
would
assume
very
close
cases,
even
under
the
present
standard,
where
there
could
be
disagreement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
do
we
decide
--
we
decide
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
this
is
fill?
do
you
agree
that
this
is
fill?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
the
question
that
we
put
earlier
as
to
whether
or
not
a
single
pipe
contained
both,
you
--
you
say
that
it
can
contain
both.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
one
--
visibly,
it's
one
stream,
but
you
say
it
consists
of
two
things?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
both
slurry--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
it
both
fill
and
non-fill?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
--
you
say
this
is
404;
it's
not
402--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
is
306?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
it
is
fill.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
--
i
thought
your
brother
would
say:
but
that
does
not
respond
to
306
effluent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
these
cases
require
us
to
decide
whether
a
plan
to
dispose
of
mining
waste
violates
the
clean
water
act.
the
petitioner
coeur
alaska
owns
kensington
gold
mine
in
southeast
alaska.
when
it
opens
and
begins
its
operation,
extracting
the
gold
will
produce
several
million
tons
of
crushed
rock
mixed
with
water.
this
mixture
is
called
slurry
and
its
waste
and
it
must
be
put
somewhere.
coeur
alaska
plans
to
put
the
slurry
in
a
small
lake
near
the
mine.
the
slurry
will
kill
the
lake's
fish
and
plant
life.
after
the
mine
closes,
however,
coeur
alaska
will
cover
the
lake
bed
with
soil
and
thereby
reclaim
it.
the
broader
and
shallower
lake
will
sustain
at
least
as
much
aquatic
life
as
it
does
now.
if
the
slurry
did
not
go
in
the
lake,
coeur
alaska
will
propose
to
put
it
on
nearby
wetlands
destroying
them
permanently.
coeur
alaska
obtained
approval
for
its
plan
from
two
agencies
that
administer
the
clean
water
act,
the
army
corps
of
engineers
and
the
environmental
protection
agency
or
the
epa.
the
corps
of
engineers
acts
under
section
404
of
the
act
and
epa
acts
under
section
402
of
the
act.
acting
under
section
404,
the
corps
of
engineers
issued
coeur
alaska
a
permanent
to
discharge
the
slurry
into
the
lake.
and
acting
under
section
402
of
the
act,
the
epa
issued
coeur
alaska
a
permit
to
discharge
water
from
the
lake
into
a
downstream
creek.
respondent's
three
environmentalist
groups
led
by
the
southeast
alaska
conservation
council
were
seacc
sued
the
agencies
in
federal
court.
seacc
made
two
arguments.
first,
seacc
argued
that
to
put
its
slurry
in
the
lake
in
the
first
place,
coeur
alaska
requires
a
permit
from
the
epa
not
the
corps
of
engineers.
second,
seacc
argued
that
the
slurry
discharge
violates
an
epa
regulation.
now,
the
epa
regulation
is
called
performance
standard.
it
forbids
the
discharge
of
waste
from
gold
mine
like
coeur
alaska's.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
both
seacc's
arguments
and
it
vacated
the
corps
of
engineers'
permit.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
we
disagree
with
both
seacc's
arguments.
first,
the
clean
water
act
states
the
corps
of
engineers
and
not
the
epa,
is
the
proper
agency
to
issue
a
permit
for
the
slurry
discharge.
this
is
because
slurry
is
defined
by
the
regulation
as
fill
material.
in
section
404
of
the
act
authorizes
the
corps
to
permit
discharges
of
fill
material.
section
402
by
contrast
states
that
the
epa
may
not
issue
permit
for
these
discharges.
second,
seacc
argues
that
epa's
performance
standards
forbid
the
slurry
discharge.
both
agencies
disagree
with
that
position
however.
in
the
view
of
both
agencies,
the
epa's
performance
standard
does
not
apply
to
discharges
of
fill
material
because
the
statute
and
regulations
do
not
give
a
clear
answer
to
this
question,
we
defer
to
the
agencies'
reasonable
interpretation.
five
factors
show
that
the
agencies'
interpretation
is
reasonable.
first,
the
agencies
interpretation
preserves
the
rule
for
the
epa's
performance
standard.
that
standard
continues
to
apply
to
the
discharge
of
water
from
the
lake
into
the
downstream
creek.
second,
the
agencies'
interpretation
does
not
permit
discharges
to
avoid
performance
standards
by
characterizing
small
amounts
of
solid
waste
as
fill
material.
third,
the
agencies'
interpretation
allows
the
corps
of
engineers
to
determine
what
is
best
for
the
aquatic
environment.
here,
for
example,
the
corps
determined
that
the
slurry
discharge
though
harming
the
lake
in
the
short-term
will
be
better
for
the
environment
in
the
long-term
than
with
the
alternative
of
permanent
loss
of
wetlands.
fourth,
the
agencies
agreed
that
no
toxic
pollutants
maybe
discharged
as
fill
material.
and
fifth,
seacc
has
not
offered
an
alternative
interpretation
that
harmonizes
the
statute
and
regulations.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
these
cases
are
remanded
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
not
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
stevens
and
souter
have
joined.
