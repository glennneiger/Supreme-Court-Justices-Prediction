justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
does
--
here's
the
--
here's
the
problem
that
i'm
--
i'm
having
and
i
think
others
may
have.
we
start,
number
one,
with
a
definition,
as
i
understand
it,
of
"pollutant"
that
includes
suspended
solids.
number
two,
there
is
an
existing
regulation
to
the
effect
that
wastewater
from
this
particular
method
of
--
of
extracting
gold
shall
--
shall
simply
not
be
released,
shall
not
be
put
into
--
into
water
bodies.
and
then
the
two
agencies
come
along,
and
in
effect
they
say,
by
regulation,
if
the
suspended
solid
in
effect
comes
out
of
a
mine,
or
if
the
wastewater
has
got
suspended
solid
in
it,
we
are
going
to
call
it
fill
and
leave
it
entirely
to
the
army
engineers
under
404,
subject
to
an
epa
veto.
and
on
the
face
of
it,
it
sounds
as
though
they
are
simply,
number
one,
defining
one
--
one
variant
of
pollution
out
of
the
epa's
jurisdiction
and,
number
two,
with
respect
to
the
wastewater,
in
effect
coming
up
with
a
contradictory
determination
about
what
should
be
done
with
it.
and
it
sounds
as
though,
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
that
with
the
statutory
and
the
regulatory
regime
on
the
one
hand
and
this
joint
regulation
on
the
other,
you've
simply
got
a
flat
contradiction,
and
queried
whether
that
can
be
anything
other
than
arbitrary
and
capricious
under
the
apa.
will
you
address
that
for--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
let's
--
let's
assume
--
and
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
cut
you
off
there,
but
before
you're
done
--
i
am
at
least
raising
it
because
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
get
a
handle
on
this
case
without
dealing
with
that
problem.
so
you
may
say,
well,
they
didn't
raise
it
well
enough,
but
i
--
i
still
want
you
to
deal
with
it
on
the
merits.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that's
--
that's
pretty
cold
comfort
when
--
when
you
treat
as
an
impoundment
area
a
natural
lake.
i
--
i
suppose
if
the
--
if
it's
proper
to
do
what
they're
doing
here,
then
the
lake
in
the
middle
of
the
everglades
is
an
impoundment
area
or
our
great
salt
lake
is
an
impoundment
area.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
is
a
long
way
from
a
settling
pond.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
what's
that
--
what's
that
got
to
do
with
the
definition
of
"impoundment
area"?
justice
david
h.
souter
my
problem
is
that
you
are
treating
--
the
corps
is
treating
as
an
impoundment
area
a
whole
natural
lake
as
distinct
from
a
--
a
settling
basin.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
--
you
say
they're
--
they're
rigorous.
my
understanding
is
--
and
i
didn't
think
it
was
seriously
disputed
here
--
is
that,
during
the
period
in
which
the
deposits
are
going
to
be
made,
the
natural
life
of
this
water
body
is
going
to
be
destroyed.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
--
and
the
--
the
corps
comes
along
and
says,
oh,
when
it's
all
over,
you
know,
it
will
come
back.
but
when
--
when
you're
destroying
the
--
the
entire
living
sort
of
corpus
of
--
of
this
lake,
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
getting
orwellian
to
say
that
there
--
there
are
rigorous
environmental
standards.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the
--
as
i
understand
it
--
and
you
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
here
--
i
--
i
thought
"suspended
solids",
i
guess
is
the
buzz
word
for
it,
is
--
is
a
form
of
pollution.
so
you're
saying,
well,
we're
destroying
the
fish
with
one
form
of
pollution
rather
than
another
form
of
pollution.
and
i
don't
know
that
that
advances
the
ball
for
your
side.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
this
comes
back
to
my
initial
question.
you
are
simply,
or
the
corps
is
simply,
defining
what
would
otherwise
be
a
pollutant,
suspended
solids
discharged
into
the
water,
by
calling
it
fill
material.
and
it
--
in
effect
it's
defining
one
subject
of
--
of
discharge
regulation
right
out
of
the
law
of
the
united
states
by
--
by
redefining
it
and
saying,
oh,
well,
it
doesn't
exist
if
it's
coming
out
of
a
mine.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
if
you
applied
the
effects
test,
the
legal
effect,
is
it
not,
is
to
define
one
form
of
pollution
as
no
longer
existent
so
long
as
that
form
of
pollution
falls
within
the
corps
of
engineers'
definition
of
"fill"?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
going
to
kill
every
living
creature
in
the
lake.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
wait
a
minute.
it's
going
to
kill
everything
in
the
lake.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
that
mean
anything
more
than
you've
got
to
get
a
404
permit,
without
addressing
the
question
whether
you
can
get
a
404
permit
if
it
has,
in
effect,
the
--
the
--
if
it
has
the
effects
which
are
supposed
to
be
regulated
by
the
effluent
limitations?
justice
david
h.
souter
where
is
--
where
is
that
in
the
appendix?
