mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
reemphasize
one
point.
the
clean
water
act
itself
--
congress
created
two
distinct,
mutually
exclusive
but
complementary
permitting
regimes.
one
is
fill
material,
which
is
governed
by
--
administered
by
the
corps
of
engineers.
the
other
is
other,
except
as
permitted
under
section
404,
administered
by
the
epa.
a
discharge,
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
kennedy,
may
be
governed
by
one
program
or
the
other,
not
both.
everybody
admits
that,
including
the
respondents.
the
fill
rule--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
it
does,
justice
stevens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it's
mutually
exclusive
in
terms
of
the
issuer
--
issuing
agency,
and
i
think
that's
a
very
important
point.
we
--
we
want
to
emphasize
that,
that
the
rules
pursuant
to
which
the
corps
of
engineers
administers
the
fill
permit
are
the
404(b)(1)
rules,
which
congress
specified
to
be
enacted
by
the
epa.
so
the
rigorous
rules
governing
the
quality
of
the
water
that's
going
to
be
affected
by
these
fill
permits
are
established
by
the
epa.
furthermore,
the
state
is
involved.
the
fisheries
departments
are
involved,
the
conservation
area
of
the
state
of
alaska.
many
different
agencies
are
involved
in
this
permitting
process.
the
permits
in
this
case
followed
900
studies,
the
expenditure
of
$26
million,
an
evaluation
by
the
epa,
the
corps
of
engineers,
the
department
of
conservation
of
alaska.
and,
justice
stevens'
point,
finally,
before
the
permit
could
be
issued,
it
had
to
go
to
the
epa
and
the
epa
had
the
power
to
veto
the
permit.
now,
congress
determined--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
they
could
not
do
that,
justice
--
chief
justice
roberts,
because
the
--
congress
made
a
choice
under
section
404
and
402.
section
402,
the
epa
program,
is
governed
by
those
effluent
limitations
under
301
and
306
and
the
standards
of
performance.
congress
made
a
choice
of
applying
section
307,
which
are
toxic
effluent
limitations
that
apply
to
the
404
permits.
that
307
regime,
which
congress
selected,
which
is
also
endorsed
by
the
epa
in
the
rules
that
the
--
that
the
corps
must
follow
in
administering
the
permit
--
that
307
provision,
to
which
i
just
referred
to,
is
in
the
404(b)(1)
regime
rules.
so
all
of
this
--
the
permitting
process,
which
congress
made
the
decision
to
put
into
two
baskets
--
either
it's
fill
material
or
it's
except
permits
under--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
--
the
--
yes.
i
--
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
but
the
better
answer
to
that,
justice
kennedy,
is
for
a
while,
as
--
as
general
garre
pointed
out,
the
epa
had
a
different
concept
of
what
was
fill
than
the
corps
of
engineers.
the
epa,
right
from
the
beginning,
said
it
will
be
the
effect
on
the
--
on
the
water.
the
corps
for
a
while
had
that
definition.
then
it
used
a
purpose
test.
both
agencies
--
the
epa
and
the
army
corps
of
engineers
--
agreed
in
2002
that
that
"purpose"
definition
of
the
word
"fill"
was
not
workable.
it
was
too
subjective.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
there
could
be
disagreement,
but
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
this
rule
was
jointly
adopted
by
the
corps
of
engineers
and
the
epa
in
2002.
to
the
extent
there's
any
ambiguity
as
to
what
fill
material
is,
both
the
army
corps
of
engineers
and
the
epa
agree
that
it
includes
slurry
from
mines.
so
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
--
that's
--
except
in
the
early
stage,
as
i
understand
it,
the
corps
and
--
the
corps
also
used
the
effects
test.
then
there
was
a
period
of
time
when
it
used
a
purpose
test.
the
epa
consistently
used
the
--
the
effects
test.
in--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
--
that's
--
until
that
point,
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
but
the
two
agencies
that
were
involved
in
this
process
determined
that
that
was
not
a
workable
test.
it
didn't
function
well.
it
allowed
too
much
evasion
and
--
and
manipulation,
and
they
both
came
together
after
long
studies
and
decided
a
reasonable
interpretation
that
was
effective,
consistent,
and
workable.
under
the
clean
water
act,
both
agencies
came
together
and
decided
that
the
definition
included
the
placement
of
overburden,
slurry,
tailings,
or
similar
mining-related
materials.
now,
to
the
extent
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
this
is
the
reasoned
judgment,
notice-and
--
comment
rulemaking
by
the
two
agencies
given
responsibility.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
i
don't
--
that
is
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
know
where
you
got
that.
that
is
the
result
in
this
case.
there
will
be--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--cholesterol.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
i
will,
justice
breyer.
[laughter]
if
it's
fill,
the
administrating,
permitting
agency
is
the
army
corps
of
engineers.
but
in
granting
that
permit,
in
evaluating
that
permit,
they
must
follow
the
404(b)(1)
guidelines
that
were
drafted
and
written
by
the
epa.
so
that
--
and
epa
has
all
sorts
of
provisions.
it
can't
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
water.
there
cannot
be
a
preferable
environmental
alternative.
it
must
go
through
the
marine
fisheries.
it
cannot
contain
that
toxic
material
that
you
are
talking
about,
that
worst
material
in
the
world.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that
--
that
may
be,
but
the
rule
404(b)(1)
guidelines
addressed
both
that
point
--
and
i
understand
your
point,
too.
but
in
--
on
11a
of
the
government's
brief
the
--
the
404(b)(1)
guidelines
are
set
forth,
and
it
includes
a
provision,
number
2
on
that
page,
violates
any
applicable
toxic
effluent
standard
or
prohibition
under
section
307
of
the
act.
so
the
water
quality
is
going
to
be
regulated
according
to
epa
standards.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
every
--
every--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
there
is
because--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
a
different
set
of
regulations.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
--
there's
not
--
it's
--
the
most
important
thing
that's
present
is
that
congress
decided
that
these
regulations
that
the
--
fill
was
different
stuff.
it
was
for
different
--
it
had
different
consequences
and
should
be
regulated
in
a
different
way.
the
definition--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
and
--
and
i'm
going
to
reserve
the
balance,
if
i
might,
for
rebuttal.
but
let
me
just
say
"pollutant"
includes
sand
and
rock.
and
what's
being
put
in
this
settling
area,
this
lake,
is
the
sand,
which
is
the
same
consistency
of
the
bottom
of
the
lake.
it's
inert
material.
it
is
not
changing
the
chemical
composition.
it
is
not
hurting
the
water
quality
of
the
lake.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
putting
--
putting
sand
or
rocks--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
it
is,
justice
souter.
putting
--
putting
sand
in
the
bottom
of
the
lake
is
going
to
do
that.
they
are
going
to
reintroduce
the
fish.
it
will
be
a
bigger
lake
with
a
better
aquatic
system
when
it's
finished.
but,
yes,
you're
correct.
in
the
interim
the
sand
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
will
kill
those
fish.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it's
a
--
it's
a
condition
for
the
permit,
and
every
agency
which
examined
this,
including
the
fisheries
department,
the
--
the
conservation
agencies
of
the
state
of
alaska
--
and
specifically
said
in
the
administrative
record
that
under
the
worst-case
scenario
they
believe
that
all
of
that
is
going
to
take
place,
and
there
will
be
more
fish
in
a
bigger
lake
and
more
livable
living
conditions
for
the
fish
and
aquatic
life
after
this
process
is
finished.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
the
respondents
would
wish
to
do
is
to
have
this
court
disagree
with
the
agencies'
interpretation
of
the
statutes
which
they
administer,
their
consistent
interpretations
of
those
statutes,
and
the
factual
findings
that
a
whole
slew
of
agencies
made
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter
of
these
permits.
the
preamble
of
the
202
--
the
2002
fill
regulations
specifically
says
--
this
is
31,135
of
federal
register
volume
67
--
epa
has
never
sought
to
regulate
fill
material
under
effluent
guidelines.
never.
there's
an
agreement,
a
memorandum
of
agreement,
between
the
epa
and
the
corps
of
engineers
in
1986.
it
is
cited
at
the
united
states
government
brief
at
page
27.
the
epa
and
the
corps
agree
--
and
this
is
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
and
i
think
something
justice
kennedy
said
and
something
justice
souter
said
with
respect
to
what
if
there
are
two
things
in
the
stream
going
into
the
water.
fill
material
remains
subject
to
404
permitting
even
if
they
occur
in
association
with
discharges
meeting
402
criteria.
that's
the
answer
to
that
question.
and
the
--
and
the
epa--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
306
provisions
in
the
statute
are
not
made
applicable
to
404
permitting,
and
the
consistent
regulatory
history
from
1973
--
and
it's
all
set
out
on
page
27
of
the
--
or
summarized
on
page
27
of
the
government's
brief
--
are
that
301
and
306
are
not
applicable
under
the
404
process.
and
if
there
was
any
doubt
at
all,
there
is
a
--
the
so-called
mine
tailings
memorandum
at
pages
141
through
145
of
the
joint
appendix,
in
which
three
top
officials
of
the
epa
construe
what
they
call
the
rules,
the
regulations,
and
the
statute.
this
is
both
agencies.
under
the
plain
regulation
--
language
of
the
rule
--
this
is
page
145a
--
under
the
plain
language
of
the
rule
and
the
agencies'
interpretation
of
the
regulation
in
its
preamble,
the
mine
tailings
that
are
to
be
placed
into
an
impoundment
are
covered
by
404.
and
it
specifically
addresses
this
froth-flotation--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
precise
question,
justice
souter,
is
addressed
on
pages
143,
144,
and
145
of
this
memorandum
from
top
officials
of
the
epa,
applicable
to
this
particular
mine
and
these
particular
discharges--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
on
pages
141
through
145a
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
it
doesn't.
it
says
--
with
due
respect,
justice
stevens,
it
says
on
the
bottom
of
page
144:
as
a
result,
the
regulatory
regime
applicable
to
the
discharges
under
section
402,
and
so
forth.
what
--
i
think
one
thing
that's
been
left
out--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
is
a
402
permit
in
this
case,
too.
there's
a
404
permit
with
respect
to
the
material
going
into
the
lake
and
a
402
permit
for
the
material
coming
out
of
the
lake
into
the
waters
of
the
united
states.
