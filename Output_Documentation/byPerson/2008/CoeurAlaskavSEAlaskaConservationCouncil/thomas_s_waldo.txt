mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
section
306(e),
congress
enacted
an
unqualified
prohibition
against
operating
any
new
source
in
violation
of
any
standard
of
performance
applicable
to
the
source.
the
standard
of
performance
at
issue
in
this
case
is
applicable
on
its
face
to
the
ore
mill
at
the
kensington
mine.
it
says
there
shall
be
no
discharge
of
process
wastewater
into
navigable
waters
from
mills
that
use
the
froth-flotation
process.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
because
that's
only
a
statement
about
whether
section
402
applies.
it
means
that
if
you
have
a
section
404
permit,
you
don't
also
need
a
section
402
permit.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
whether
a
404
permit
is
appropriate
under
any
particular
circumstances,
and
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
whether
section
306
is
applicable.
in
fact--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--yes.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
but
that
determination
was
based
on
a
misinterpretation
of
the
clean
water
act.
that
prefatory
clause
that
--
that
the
chief
justice
was
asking
about
doesn't
say
anything
about
whether
section
306
applies.
306
does
not
have
a
prefatory
clause
like
that,
which
strongly
suggests
that
it's
not
intended
to
apply
there.
in
other--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--that
the
interpretation
as
it's
presented
in
this
case
is
contrary
to
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
well,
i
--
i
doubt
that
epa
could
--
could
lawfully
under
the
clean
water
act
enact
such
a
thing,
because
the
clean
water
act
requires
epa
to
regulate
suspended
solids,
and
epa
has
always
regulated
suspended
solids
through
effluent
limitations.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
if
it
--
i'm
sorry.
so
it--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--yes--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--that's
--
that's
a
discharge
of
a
pollutant.
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
yes.
and
so--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--well,
the
corps
of
engineers
has
the
authority
under
section
404
to
grant
fill
material
permits--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--no,
not
when
it
violates
effluent
standards.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
oh,
oh,
no.
that
doesn't
--
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
understand
that
part
of
your
question.
yes,
if
--
if
there
is
an
effluent
limitation
for
a
particular
source
--
remember,
effluent
limitations
are
adopted
for
industrial
sources,
and
so
you
would
have
to
look
at
what
the
source
of
that
discharge
was.
and
if
epa
had
identified
that
source,
a
particular
kind
of
factory
of
some
kind,
a
mill,
you
know,
a
leather
tanning
facility
or
something
like
that
--
if
epa
had
adopted
effluent
limitations
that
were
applicable
to
that
source,
then
discharges
have
to
comply
with
those
effluent
limitations.
it's
important
to
realize
here
that
the
clean
water
act,
contrary
to
the
way
the
petitioners
try
to
present
it,
is
not
just
one
big
permitting
statute.
it's
not
simply
402
and
404,
and
that
determines
everything.
the
effluent
limitations
under
sections
301
and
306
have
independent
applicability
directly
to
discharges.
they
are
separately
enforceable
by
epa
and
through
citizens--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--something
that
is
governed
by
an
effluent
limitation,
yes.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
oh,
absolutely.
epa
is
required
in
the
clean
water
act
to
regulate
suspended
solids
through
effluent
limitations.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
that
implies
some
liquid,
right;
that
--
that
the
solids
are
present
in
a
liquid,
like
the
discharge
here.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
by
weight.
by
volume,
it's
30
percent
solids.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
well,
the
--
the
standard
in
this
case
prohibits
a
discharge
of
process
wastewater.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
and
so,
if--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--there
might
be
some
point
at
which
the
liquid
content
of
a
solid
waste
is
so
small
that
epa
wouldn't
regard
it
as
process
wastewater
anymore.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
discharge
is
process
wastewater.
the
government
has
conceded
that
point.
and
--
and
it's
extremely
important,
because
epa
is
required
to,
as
i
said,
regulate
suspended
solids
through
effluent
limitations
and
to
adopt
a
zero
discharge--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--as
long
as
there's
no
effluent
limitation
governing
it,
yes.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
it
depends
on
if
epa
has
adopted
an
effluent
limitation
for
it.
so
if
--
if
that
waste
stream
that
you're
describing
comes
from
some
kind
of
factory,
a
--
for
example,
cement
manufacturing
is
a
source
category
that
epa--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--well,
epa--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--epa
has
always
regulated
industrial
sources
that
--
whose
raw
process
wastewater
contains
high
levels
of
suspended
solids,
high
enough
that
it
would
have
the
effect
of
fill
material
and
could
be
considered
fill.
in
fact
--
and
--
and,
in
fact,
epa
has
always
had
a
definition
of
"fill
material"
that
was
based
on
the
effects.
so
for
more
than
30
years,
epa
has
been
regulating
sources
like
ore
processing
mills,
cement
manufacturing
plants,
aluminum
smelters,
coal-fired
power
plants,
all
of
which
and
many
more
require
the
use
of
settling
ponds
to
remove
the
solids
because
they're--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--yes,
it's
both.
it's
fill
material
and
it's
process
wastewater
that's
subject
to
an
effluent
limitation.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
well,
it's
--
it's
one
slurry.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
it
meets
both
definitions.
the
--
the
solids
are
part
of
the
process
wastewater.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
well,
it
is
--
it
is
a
slurry
that
contains
water,
chemicals--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--metals--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--it's
--
it's
fill
and
it's
process
wastewater.
it's
both.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
no.
in
this
case,
there
can't
be
any
permit
because
there
is
a
new
source
performance
standard
that
prohibits--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--if
there's
an
effluent
limitation
applicable,
it
will
end
up
having
to
be
epa
that
issues
the
permit,
and
that's
--
that's
simply
because
the
corps
of
engineers
just
doesn't
have
the
tools
available
to
apply
effluent
limitations
in
its
404
permits,
except
for
toxic
substances.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
well--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--well,
it's
--
where
i
would
find
that
is
in
section
306(e),
which
says
--
which
is
a
prohibition
against
operating
sources
in
violation
of
performance
standards.
and
--
and
here
where
you
have--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--the
performance
--
right.
the
performance
standard
that
says--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--oh.
oh,
i
see
what
you're
saying.
yes.
well,
even
--
the
--
what
the
problem
is,
is
that
section
404
doesn't
make
any
provision
for
application
of
effluent
limitations
and
performance
standards
under
sections
301
and
306.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
yes,
that's
correct,
but
--
but
it
does
provide
the
tool
for
epa
to
apply
those
effluent
limitations
that
you
were
asking
about.
the
effluent
limitations
have
to
be
complied
with,
and
epa
is
the
agency
under
section--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--well,
those
standards
apply
if
you
have
fill
material
that's
not
subject
to
some
effluent
limitation.
effluent
limitations
are
only
adopted
for
industrial
sources--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--where
does
it
say
--
i'm
sorry.
could
you
clarify
the
question?
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
it's
--
it
is
an
absence
of
a
provision
in
404.
but
--
but
the
thing
is,
even
if
404
has
--
even
if
the
corps
of
engineers
--
and
i
should
say,
we
agree
with
the
government
and
with
the
agencies
about
this.
the
agencies
have
never
interpreted
section
404
to
provide
for
the
application
of
effluent
limitations
in
404
permits.
the
404(b)
guidelines
don't
provide
for
it.
it's
not
provided
in
the
statute.
and
so,
they
just
don't
have
the
ability
to
do
it.
the
problem
is,
they
try
to
carry
that
a
step
farther
and
take
that
absence
of
provision
to
say
that
it's
an
exception
from
effluent
limitations,
to
say
that
they
don't
have
to
comply
with
section
301
and
306.
but
it
doesn't
say
that,
and
that's
an
implied
exception.
and
the
court
should
only
find
an
implied
exception
if
it's
necessary
to
avoid
absurd
results.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
no
one--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--yes.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
it
doesn't
even
have
to
fill
it
up
very
much--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--just
a
tiny
bit.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
that's
the--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
well,
let
me
--
i
think--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--the
corps
of
engineers
only
applies
toxic
effluent
limitations.
there
are
other
pollutants
that
are
nontoxic--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--well,
that's
not,
and
let
me
explain
how
they
have
been
operating,
because
i
think
that
will
help
clarify
it.
for
40
years,
epa
has
regulated
sources
like
ore
processing
mills,
aluminum
smelters,
others
that
i
have
named,
others
that
are
listed
in
our
brief,
and
has
applied
effluent
limitations
to
those
discharges.
now,
you
--
you
hear
this
statement
a
lot--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--absolutely,
and
let
me
explain
that,
because
you
hear
this
statement
a
lot:
epa
never
regulates
fill
material.
well,
that's
because
when
you
apply
the
effluent
limitations,
it's
not
fill
material
anymore.
the
effluent
limitations
require
the
use
of
settling
ponds
that
are
not
in
navigable
waters.
the
settling
ponds
or
other
technologies
remove
almost
all
of
the
solids
so
that
the
discharge
that
is
permitted
by
epa
in
the
section
402
permit
might
have
a
limitation
of
20
or
30
milligrams
per
liter,
something
that
wouldn't
have
any
measurable
filling
effect
on
the
receiving
water
body.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
settling
ponds.
exactly.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
exactly.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
when
they
adopted
the
new
regulation,
they
were
very
clear
that
they
intended
to
continue
their
past
practice.
the
agencies
never
stated
an
intent
to
repeal
or
modify
or
change
the
applicability
of
any
effluent
limitations,
and
in
fact,
this
question
came
up
repeatedly:
what
happens
if
it's
fill
material
but
it's
subject
to
an
effluent
limitation?
and
every
time
they
addressed
it,
they
said
the
same
thing:
effluent
limitations
will
continue
to
apply
and
will
be
applied
through
section
402
permits.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
that's
what
it
was
all
about,
yes.
that's
what
they
were
talking
about.
that
was
addressed
over
and
over
again
in
the
--
in
the
fill
rule,
and
they
never
said--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--anything
that
contradicted--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--the
--
i'm
talking
about
the
federal
register
preamble
and
the--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--right.
well--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--the
definition
of
"fill
material"
is
simply
a
definition.
by
itself
it
doesn't
have
any
operative
effect.
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
authorize
any
particular
kinds
of
discharges.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
no,
it's
been
--
it's
been
prohibited.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
it's
been
prohibited.
it's
illegal
for
--
to
permit
the
discharge
of
the
process
wastewater--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--well,
if
any
--
i
don't
know
if
anyone
ever
asked
to
do
that,
but
if
they
did
the
answer
would
have
been
no.
i
can't
come
up
with
an
answer
because
that's
what
the
effluent
limitations
require.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
no,
no,
no.
we
--
we
agree
with
epa
on
this
point.
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
between
epa
and
the
corps
of
engineers
as
to
which
was
the
preferred
site.
epa
preferred
the
dry
land
disposal
site,
and
--
and
we
agreed
that
has
much
less
adverse
effect
on
the
ecosystem,
but--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--an
even
more--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--yes,
it
has
--
it
does
have
adverse
impacts,
but
it's
--
in
epa's
view
and
in
our
view,
is
not
as
bad
as
filling
up
a
lake
and
killing
all
the
fish
and
aquatic
life
in
the
lake
and--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--yes.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
right,
and--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--that's
right.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
but
it's
--
also
an
important
point
for
us
here
is
that
this
is
a
national
rule,
and
epa
considered
these
kind
of
alternative
land
use
requirements
as
an
effect
of
its
no-discharge
rule.
when
the
--
epa
specifically
addressed
the
fact
that
if
you
prohibit
discharges
of
process
wastewater
into
navigable
waters,
it's
going
to
require
using
more
land
to
dispose
of
all
that
solid
waste
somewhere,
and
they
determined
that
the
benefits
of
keeping
process
wastewater
out
of
the
navigable
waters
was
worth
it.
and
so
it's
both
site-specifically
preferable,
and
it's
a
determination
that
was
based--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--oh,
we've
already
taken
that
position,
yes.
we've
been
working
--
we
--
we
were
working
with
the
mining
company
after
the
ninth
circuit
decision
to
identify
an
alternative--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
i
don't
want
to
make
any
representations
about
what
a
client
might
have
said
over
the
last
20
years
of
this
mine,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
we
were
working
with
the
agencies
and
with
coeur
to
identify
an
alternative
site.
the
agencies
--
or
the
coeur
applied
for
the
permits
to
do
that,
and
--
pursuant
to
this
mediation
we
were
having,
and
then
abruptly
pulled
out
a
few
weeks
ago.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
when
--
when
the
corps
of
engineers
proposed
the
draft
404
permit,
epa
commented
on
it
and
said,
we
disagree
with
your
conclusion
that
filling
up
the
lake
is
the
least
environmentally
damaging
alternative.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
yes,
epa
can
veto
if
it's--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--well,
epa
--
its
--
the
veto
authority
is
a
discretionary
authority--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--if
it
finds
unacceptable
adverse
consequences.
and
for
understandable
reasons,
epa
very
rarely
exercises
that
authority.
but
epa
never
changed
its
position
about
whether
the
--
about
which
was
the
preferred
alternative.
the
epa--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--it
--
apparently
not
enough
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
one
of
those
situations
where
they
wanted
to
veto
based
on
unacceptable
adverse
consequences.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
well,
sure.
there's
microinvertebrae
and--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--i
mean,
all
sorts
of
the
things
that
fish
feed
on,
plant
life
and
animal
life
and
all
that
stuff.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
yes.
whatever.
i'm
not
an
expert
on
the
ecology
of
this
lake,
but
there's
a
couple
of
different
kinds
of
fish
and
other
life
that
make
the
--
that
make
it
possible
for
those
fish
to
live
there,
and
it
will
essentially--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--all
be
destroyed.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
epa
can
veto
for
unacceptable
adverse
consequences.
it's
not
a
way
to
enforce
effluent
limitations.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
because
that's
all
404(c)
says.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
well,
but--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--the
--
the
position
that
epa
has
taken
in
this
case,
unfortunately,
is
that,
if
the
discharge
meets
that
definition
of
"fill
material",
no
matter
how
bad
the
consequences
are
for
water
quality,
it's
fill
material,
and
it's
therefore
exempt
from
effluent
limitations--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--only
if
it
was
for
--
well,
it
was
for
--
they
found
adverse
--
unacceptable
adverse
consequences--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--it's
a
--
it's
a
different
standard
from
whether
it
violates
an
effluent
limitation
is
all
i'm
saying.
and
i
want
to
be
clear
that
the
effluent
in
this
case,
although
it
doesn't
necessarily
violate
any
toxic
pollutant
effluent,
it
is
toxic.
it's
toxic
with
conventional
pollutants.
it
has
a
p
h
of
10,
which
is
toxic
to
aquatic
life.
it's
very
high.
it's
about
the
p
h
of
ammonia,
is
what
this
slurry
effluent
is
that's
being
discharged
in
this
case.
and
the--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--it'll
dilute
in
the
lake.
they're
using
the
lake
as
their
diluting
settling
pond.
that's
right.
they're
using
a
navigable
water
body--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--oh,
it'll
--
it'll
dilute
in
the
lake,
so
it
will
revert
to
normal
levels--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--correct.
oh,
i
mean,
that
happens,
you
know,
in
a
--
some
sort
of
a
mixing
zone
just
outside
the
pipe.
that
happens
pretty
quickly.
now,
for
the
lake
to
recover--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--of
the
slurry.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
of
the
slurry.
that's
right.
and
now,
i
want
to
talk
about
this
allegation
that
it's
like
dumping
wet
sand
in
the
lake.
that's
not
true
at
all.
they
tested
the
--
the
tailings
sediment
from
this
discharge
with
two
organisms,
and
with
one
of
them,
it
killed
95
percent
of
the
organisms
in
the
test,
which
is
way
over
the
top
for
epa's
toxicity
threshold.
in
the
other
organism
they
had,
it
--
the
organism
survived,
but
their
reproduction
rate
was
significantly
reduced,
also
meeting
the
toxicity
test
standards
that
epa
establishes.
so
this--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--no.
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
right.
that's
what
the
solids
--
that's
the
effect
of
the
solids,
and
that's
why,
as
a
result
of
that,
they
--
they
established
this
rule
that--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--they
took
that
slurry,
they
let
the
solids
settle
down
to
the
bottom,
and
then
they
tested
those
solids
for
what
effect
it
would
have
on
some
fresh
water
organisms,
because
they
were
trying
to
determine
whether
the
lake
would
be
able
to
recover
from
depositing
all
these
solids
into
the
lake.
and
they
found
that
it
had
a
very
high
toxicity
level.
and
so
what
they
did
to
try
to
remedy
that
is
require
depositing
native
vegetation
on
the
top
of
all
of
that,
after
the
mine
closes.
and
they
are
hoping
that
that
will
have
the
effect
of
letting
the
lake
recover.
but
epa
concluded
that
it
will
take
decades,
if
ever,
before
the
lake
can
recover
from
that.
so
this
--
this
is
not
some
benign
wet-sand
kind
of
discharge.
it's
a
toxic
slurry
with
a
high
p
h
level
and
with
effects
that
are
going
to
last
for
decades.
and
if
epa
--
if
section
404
is
interpreted
to
allow
these
kinds
of
discharges
to
be
emitted
exempt
from
effluent
limitations,
it
eviscerates
key
requirements
of
the
clean
water
act.
epa
is
required
to
regulate
sources
of
this
type
through
effluent
limitations.
epa
is
required
to
regulate
the
suspended
solids
through
effluent
limitations
from
industrial
sources
like
this.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
if
there's
an
effluent
limitation,
the
effluent
--
there's
a
performance
standard
under
section
306.
the
performance
standard
must
be
complied
with
under
section
306(e).
and
the
only
way--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--no.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
404
is
not
appropriate
here
because
there
is
an
effluent
limitation.
it's
fill
material--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--it's
fill
material,
but
it's
not
fill
material
that
is
available
for
--
for
a
section
404
permit.
and
epa
has
always
regulated
discharges
from
sources
like
this,
that
meet
that
definition
of
"fill
material".
epa
has
had
an
effects-based
definition
of
"fill
material"
since
virtually
the
beginning
of
the
clean
water
act.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
no,
it's
fill
material.
in
this
case,
it's
fill
material,
but
it's
just
fill
material
that's
not
eligible
for
a
404
permit.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
yes,
that's
correct.
and--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--it
depends.
if
it's
--
if
that
discharge
is
covered
by
an
effluent
limitation,
yes,
that's
correct.
and
--
and
i
want
to
be
clear
about
this
point,
that
epa
--
well,
i
guess
my
time
is
up.
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
okay.
epa
amended
its
regulations
in
1979
specifically
to
recognize
the
fact
that
some
discharges
of
fill
material
are
not
eligible
for
section
404
permits
and
require
npdes
permits.
at
that
time,
the
regulations
said
you
don't
need
an
npdes
permit
if
it's
fill
material.
epa
amended
that
regulation
to
say
you
don't
need
an
npdes
permit
if
it's
fill
material
and
it's
subject
to
section
404
of
the
clean
water
act.
and
the
purpose--
mr.
thomas
s.
waldo
--thank
you.
