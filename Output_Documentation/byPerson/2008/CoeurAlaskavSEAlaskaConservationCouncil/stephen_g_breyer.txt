justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here's
--
i
--
i'm
perhaps
missing
this.
i
--
this
is
in
general
what
i
don't
understand,
how
this
works.
my
understanding
is
that
under
404
something
is
fill
--
they
have
a
definition.
and
it's
fill,
among
other
things,
if
it
changes
the
bottom
level
of
any
portion
of
water
in
the
united
states.
that's
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
and
somewhere
i
have
the
idea
--
but
i
can't
find
it
in
the
briefs
now
--
that
it
has
to
raise
the
bottom
level
by
55
feet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
some
--
there's
some
number
of
feet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
result
of
this
case.
but,
anyway,
it
raises
the
level.
i
guess
it
has
to
raise
it
some
significant
amount.
all
right.
so
what
happens
in
this
situation?
let
us
think
of
the
worst
pollutant
you
can
think
of.
think
of
that.
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
maybe
it's
saturated
fat
in
potato
chips.
[laughter]
something
absolutely
terrible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
we're
going
to
think
of
that
pollutant.
and
now
let's
suppose
that
with
the
agreement
of
the
army
corps
of
engineers
a
company
takes
this
pollutant,
which
is
the
worst
one
you
could
think
of,
that
the
epa
would
never
let
you
go
within
50
feet
of
it,
and
they
take
it,
and
they
fill
a
lake
with
it
up
to
the
level
of
55
feet,
or
20
feet,
or
whatever
number
of
feet.
i
mean,
it
just
can't
be
that
simply
because
they
poured
a
lot
of
it
in
and
it
fills
up
the
bottom
of
the
lake,
that
suddenly
the
epa
can't
regulate
it
anymore.
that
--
that
--
since
that's
so
counterintuitive,
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
take
a
terrible
pollutant
and
fill
the
bottom
of
the
lake
with
it
and
now
it's
up
to
the
army
corps
of
engineers
and
not
up
to
the
epa
--
that's
so
counterintuitive
that
i
assume
i
don't
understand
the
statute,
and
you
will
explain
it
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
identical.
so
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
i
heard
you
say
before
that
it
was
not
identical.
that
--
i
mean
if,
of
course,
epa
takes
all
its
regs
and
applies
those
regs
when
the
army
corps
of
engineers
considers
a
permit
under
404
so
that
you
couldn't
get
an
army
corps
of
engineers
permit
unless
you
complied
with
the
402,
et
cetera,
regs,
then
this
all
could
come
to
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there
must
be
something
missing
in
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
most
important
thing
that's
missing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
what
might
be
missing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
can
you
go
back--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--could
you
go
back
for
a
second
to
my
discussion
with
mr.
olson?
i'm
thinking
of
it
in
very
simplified
terms.
the
simplified
terms
is,
i
think
of
a
pipe
and
i
think
of
a
circumstance
where
some
terrible
pollutant
comes
out
of
the
pipe
that
would
be
subject
to
306.
and
if
the
pipe
ends
up
in
a
river
or
a
lake,
a
regular
lake,
it
could
fill
up
the
bottom.
it
seems
possible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
if
it
fills
up
the
bottom,
it's
called
404.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
know.
a
little
bit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
--
i
see
the
point.
but
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me,
if
it
fills
up
to
the
bottom
to
whatever
point,
it's
fill.
so
now
it's
the
army
corps
of
engineers.
if
it
has
effluent
in
it,
it's
effluent
and
so
now
it's
under
epa.
in
other
words,
you
have
both.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
this
has
only
been
going
on
for
40
years.
i'm
sure
this
isn't
the
first
time
they've
had
both.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
so
i
don't
understand.
what
i
would
think
of
is
if
--
if
you
have
two
sets
of
standards
and
it's
both,
they
should
satisfy
both.
i'm
not
writing
these
statutes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
now
--
now
i
heard
from
--
from
--
i
might
interpret
mr.
olson
--
he
may
not
have
really
said
this,
but
i
--
the
way
i
heard
it
was:
well,
don't
worry,
because
if
it's
fill
and
you
get
it
over
to
the
corps
of
engineers,
they're
going
to
apply
the
effluent
standard
anyway.
and
now
you're
sort
of
saying:
well,
if
it's
--
they're
going
to
apply
some
standard.
and
then
there
was
a
question
of,
well,
what
standard,
and
we
got
a
little
vague
there.
now
--
now,
what
happens
if
it
goes
to
the
epa
as
effluent?
justice
alito's
question
is,
do
they
apply
the
fill
standard?
and
between
my
response
to
these
two
answers,
i
still
don't
understand
how
it
works.
it
--
help
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
now,
if
you
lose
this
case,
what
we're
going
to
have
is
all
the
fish
are
going
to
be
killed
by
some
horrible
pollutant,
and
the
--
the
army
corps
of
engineers
can't
do
anything
about
it,
and
the
only
reason
is
we
put
enough
of
the
pollutant
in
there
to
fill
it
up
10
feet
from
the
bottom.
and
then
if
you
did
it
the
other
way,
if
the
epa
regulated
it,
it
might
do
something
terrible
under
404,
and
they
couldn't
do
anything
about
it.
now,
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
that's
really
how
these
agencies
have
been
operating
for
40
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
it
right
--
now,
i
am
back
on
my
hobby
horse
--
but
if
it's
right
that
this
slurry
is
pushing
into
this
lake
50
feet
or
75
feet
covering
the
bottom
with
some
stuff,
a
lot
of
it's
dirt,
and
some
of
it's
the
worst
chemical
ever,
except
it's
not
toxic.
okay.
i
guess
cyanide
isn't
toxic.
but
the
--
the
--
now,
i
just
heard
that
if
the
epa
doesn't
give
the
permit
but
the
corps
of
engineers
does,
the
epa
has
the
power
to
veto
the
permit.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
if
they
have
a
veto--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know
it
comes
under
a
different
statute,
but
in
any
instance
where
in
fact
they
see
that
some
of
their
rules
that
they
promulgate
are
being
violated
and
they
think
the
corps
of
engineers
is
not
paying
attention
to
those
rules,
they
can
veto
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
they
don't
veto
it,
then
that
would
be
a
way
of
reconciling
these
two
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
couldn't
they
veto
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
wouldn't
an
unacceptable
adverse
consequence
be
that
it
puts
all
this
effluent
in
the
water?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
in
fact,
if
you
have
this
mix
and
it
--
it
goes
as
an
effluent
part
and
a
fill
part,
in
your
view,
what?
that
the
statute
says
both
agencies
regulate?
they
have
to
meet
both?
one
or
the
other?
how
does
it
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
fill
material
is
only
that
material
as
to
which
no
effluent
standard
applies?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
404
material
is
material
such
that
it
is
fill
material
and
there
is
no
effluent
standard
applicable?
