fill
material
trumps
effluent,
in
other
words?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
could
contain
it
so
long
as
it's
--
as
it
--
as
it
is
not
transitory.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
isn't
it
arguable
that
the
best
place
for
--
for
really
toxic
stuff
is
at
the
bottom
of
a
lake
so
long
as
it
stays
there
and
is
not
carried--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
nontoxic
covered
by
402?
justice
antonin
scalia
nontoxic
is
covered
by
402.
you
--
you
can
violate
the
effluent
guidelines
by
--
by
pouring
into
the
waters
of
the
united
states
even
nontoxic
materials.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
under
404
it's
only
toxic.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
big
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
--
could
the
epa
allow
a
point
source
to
discharge
sand
slurry
--
there's
nothing
in
it
but
sand
--
into
a
river?
wouldn't
you
have
to
--
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
you
need
some
permission
from
the
epa
to
do
that?
wouldn't
that
violate
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
want
to
discharge.
i
have
a
pipe
and
--
and
there
is
sand
on
my
land
which
is
being
washed
away.
i'm
discharging
all
that
sand
into
a
river.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
violate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--discharge
of
a
pollutant.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
i
do
the
same
thing
in
a
--
in
a
lake,
because
i
want
to
fill
the
lake,
what
--
of
what
possible
application
is
the
fill
standard
unless
it
permits
what
would
otherwise
be
prohibited
under
--
under
the
earlier
sections?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
it
violates
effluent
standards.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
--
you
say
that
if
you
discharge
sand
into
--
into
a
river,
it
--
it
violates
effluent
standards.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
--
but
do
you
have
a
case
over
these
40
years
where
a
company
was
trying
to
use
the
emission
from
the
mine
as
a
fill
material
in
a
lake
rather
than
in
a
settling
pond
and
where
the
epa,
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
using
it
to
fill
a
lake,
applied
its
effluent
standards?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--evidently
not.
i
mean,
the
epa
says
not.
do
you
have
a
--
an
instance
where
it
was
prohibited
where
a
company
wanted
to
--
to
emit
fill
material
into
a
lake
and
the
epa
said
no,
you
can't
do
it,
because
of
the
effluent
limitations?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
--
your
40
years
of
experience
then
really
don't
--
don't
cover
this
case.
people
have
been
putting
it
into
settling
ponds.
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
the
other
side
says
that
the
alternative
to
this
would
be
even
worse,
or
it
sounds
worse
to
me,
anyway.
what
--
what
is
your
solution?
closing
down
the
mine?
is
there
any--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
--
why
do
you
say
the
epa
preferred
the
--
the
solution
of
filling
in
the
wetlands
and
creating
an
ash
pentagon?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it
really
felt
that
way,
couldn't
it
--
couldn't
it
simply
have
vetoed
the
permit?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
couldn't
have
felt
very
strongly
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
couldn't
have
preferred
it
very
much,
or
it
would
have
vetoed
this
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
plankton
and
stuff.
