was
--
was
there
an
element
in
imbler
of
the
fact
that
you
have
to
make
tactical
and
strategic
decisions
at
--
at
the
moment
that
are
difficult,
that
call
for
judgment
that
has
to
be
exercised
on
the
spur
of
the
moment?
this
is
somewhat
different.
this
is
--
this
is
a
long-term
commitment
or
a
long-term
policy
that
the
respondents
are
arguing
for.
it
seems
to
me
somewhat
different
than
the
dynamics
that
inform
the
imbler
decision.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
suppose
that
is
why
the
petitioners
seemed
to
change
their
theory.
they
--
they
--
they
were
--
they
were
concerned
about
prosecutorial
immunity,
so
they
take
it
to
the
higher
level
of
policy.
when
--
when
they
do
that,
i
suppose
they
might
have
the
stronger
argument
if
they
could
show
deliberate
indifference.
are
there
cases
that
help
them
on
the
"deliberate
indifference"?
what's
--
what's
the
best
case
for
them
on
deliberate
indifference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
is
why
the
case
is
hard,
and
i
--
i
almost
have
to
see
what
the
violation
would
be
before
i
could
determine
the
qualified
immunity
aspect
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
we
are
deciding
in
sort
of
in
a
vacuum.
it's
a
little
difficult.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
monell
case
--
does
the
monell
case
rest
on
the
assumption
that
there
can
be
instances
where
a
policy
makes
the
policy
of
those
who
adopted
the
policy
liable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
broad
ethical
scheme
of
things,
apart
from
liability
under
this
statute,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
newly
elected
district
attorney
would
take
seriously
the
obligation
to
make
sure
that
everybody
was
following
brady.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
the
next
point.
if
i
were
a
prosecutor,
i
would
say:
this
is
my
constitutional
duty
to
say
it,
in
the
broad
sense
of
--
of
my
ethical
obligations
of
my
duties
to
the
public.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
it's
more
than
that.
he
can't
be
indifferent
to
sloppy
practices
in
the
office--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--consistent
with
his
or
her
obligations
to
perform
their
duties.
