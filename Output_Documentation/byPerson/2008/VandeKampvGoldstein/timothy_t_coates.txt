mr.
timothy
t.
coates
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
from
a
ninth
circuit
opinion
that
essentially
creates
an
exception
to
absolute
prosecutorial
immunity
for
chief
advocates
and
supervising
advocates.
the
court's
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit
essentially
held
that
prosecutorial
policies
that
apply
to
an
entire
body
of
cases
in
a
trial
office
do
not
qualify
for
absolute
immunity.
we
submit
that
this
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
imbler
v.
pachtman
and
its
progeny,
applying
the
functional
approach
to
absolute
immunity.
there
is
essentially
no
distinction
between
a
chief
advocate
or
supervising
prosecutor
implementing
a
policy
directing
that
cases
be
handled
in
a
particular
manner
and
that
particular
chief
advocate
or
supervising
advocate
actually
participating
in
the
courtroom.
because
of
the
size
of
the
prosecutorial
agencies,
it's
not
feasible
that
a
chief
advocate
or
supervisor
can
be
in
a
courtroom
in
every
single
case.
but
they
can
put
their
prosecutorial
stamp
on
each
case
through
the
implementation
of
policy,
through
training,
or
through
other
means.
here
the
policy
at
issue
concerns
compliance
with
the
obligation
to
disclose
exculpatory
information
under
brady
v.
maryland
and
also
giglio
v.
united
states.
in
imbler
versus
pachtman,
the
court
recognized
that
those
obligations
are
core
prosecutorial
obligations
that
are
part
of
the
prosecution's
intimate
relationship
to
the
fairness
of
the
trial
proceedings.
and
we
submit
that
that
duty,
that
function,
is
the
same
whether
it's
performed
in
the
courtroom
or
whether
it's
performed
by
a
chief
advocate
or
supervising
advocate
in
terms
of
formulating
policy
or
when
making
particular
policy
decisions.
imbler
recognized
that
these
core
decisions
had
to
be
insulated.
otherwise,
it
would
spawn
litigation
that
would
burden
the
judicial
process.
and
it
might
cause
them
to
hesitate
to
produce
particular
exculpatory
information.
it
might
create
a
burden
of
having
them
involved
in
more
lawsuits
than
actually
performing
their
function
and
prosecuting
the
criminal
law.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
well,
the
court
in
imbler
did
mention
a
time
frame
in
which
decisions
have
to
be
made
--
quickly
made
by
individual
prosecutors.
it
also
noted
the
sheer
number
of
decisions
that
are
often
made
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
i
would
say,
with
respect
to
chief
advocates
and
--
and
supervisors,
the
number
of
those
types
of
decisions
is
the
same.
they
have
the
same
complexity
in
determining
what
is
going
to
come
up
in
every
single
case
as
an
individual
prosecutor
does
in
a
--
in
a
single
case.
moreover,
there
is
a
multitude
more
that
they
have
to
consider
because
they
are
considering
the
possibility
of
its
impact
on
thousands
of
cases
within
the
office.
i
will
note,
though,
in
butz
v.
economou,
where
the
court
extended
absolute
immunity
to
individuals
prosecuting
agency
actions,
that
same
point
was
raised.
but
some
of
the
conduct
there
was
a
bit
more
drawn-out
in
terms
of
the
investigative
manner
--
not
the
investigative
manner,
but
the
--
the
prosecutorial
process
used
by
the
administrative
agency.
and
the
court
didn't
find
that
--
that
longer
time
frame
to
be
dispositive.
going
back
to
imbler,
it
again
looked
at
what
the
basic
function
was
in
the
administrative
agency
proceeding
and
found,
yes,
it
is
akin
to
prosecutorial
conduct.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
the--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--the
lay
person--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--the
layperson,
as
a
private
actor,
i
think
would
not
be.
i
think
the
prosecutor
that
developed
the
policy
would
be.
it
would
be
like
delegating
it
to
a
staff
member.
it
might
depend
also
on
how
close
the
relationship
is.
the
court
has
noted
in
some
of
the
judicial
immunity
cases
that
sometimes
court
clerks
can
perform
functions
that
are
essentially
judicial
functions.
in
that
case,
though,
under
the
court's
jurisprudence
with
private
actors,
they
might
have
only
qualified
immunity,
the
private
actors.
but
the
decision
to
use
them
would
be
prosecutorial.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
because
it's
not
so
much
the
physical
task
of
doing
it.
it's
carrying
out
the
obligation
of
performing
that
particular
function.
the
function
is
compliance
with
giglio
and
brady.
that
is
always
a
prosecutorial
function.
whether
the
data
is
kept
with
a
police
department
or
an
investigative
agency,
the
buck
stops
with
the
prosecutor.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
if
he
is
just
collating
data,
then
that
is
--
that's
--
that's
a
task.
our
point
is
that
this
isn't
about
just
collating
data.
it's
about
the
policy
that
data
must
be
collated
and
used.
that
is
the
brady-giglio
obligation.
you
can't
divorce
the
--
the
information
from
the
purpose
for
which,
why
it's
supposed
to
be
used.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
well,
i
--
perhaps
i
misunderstood
the
question.
it
sounds
to
me
that
the
prosecutor
has
made
a
decision
that
he
is
going
to
put
this
thing
in
place,
this
process
in
place.
that's
their
way
that
they
satisfy
or
don't
satisfy
giglio
or
brady.
maybe
they
don't
satisfy.
maybe
it's
a
terrible
decision.
but
i
think
that
decision
ends
up
being
prosecutorial
in
nature.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
setting
up
the
program,
no.
but
the
--
i
think
the
buck
stops
with
the
prosecutor
as
to
whether
that's
a
valid
process
or
not.
i
mean,
the
person
may
adequately
perform
their
function,
or
they
may
not.
but
the
person
at
the
end
of
the
day
who
is
responsible
for
it
ends
up
being
the
prosecutor.
and
he
may
inevitably
--
the
person
may
inevitably
perform
something,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
prosecutor
is
the
one
that
--
that
has
the
task
under
giglio
and
brady
of
ensuring
the
accuracy
of
the
information.
i
think
that
kind
of
underscores
here
the
approach
the
respondent
has
taken
is
to
kind
of
say,
well,
this
is
just
a
collection
of
data
here,
this
is
just
bookkeeping.
but
it's
not.
the
core
of
the
constitutional
claim
here
is
that
there
is
an
obligation
under
brady
and
giglio
somehow
to
collect
this
information,
to
disseminate
this
information.
and
that's
the
obligation
that
we
are
being
sued
for,
and
that's
the
sort
of
thing
that
prosecutors
do.
and
you
can
you
hire
someone
to
do
it,
but
somebody
is
the
gatekeeper.
someone
has
to
basically
decide
what
goes
in
or
what
doesn't
go
in
and
whether
it's
sufficient
or
insufficient
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
comply
with
--
with
brady
and
giglio.
and
so
that
can't
be
distinguished
from
the
--
the
prosecutorial
role,
whether
it's
conducted
by
a
--
a
chief
advocate
or
by
a
supervising
advocate.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
i
couldn't
say
what
the
best
case
is
for
them.
i
could
not
say
what
the
best
case
is
for
them
on
--
on
"deliberate
indifference".
we
have
not
pushed
on
the
merits
part
of
this
case.
it
was
not
briefed
down
below,
and
it
is
not--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
indeed.
i
mean,
several
amici
has
raise
the
question
of
whether
there
is
the
constitutional
violation
at
all,
but
it
has
not
been
raised
below.
and
of
course,
under
this
court's
decision
in
buckley
we
have
to
assume
the
existence
of
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
precisely.
but
i
think
our
point
is
that
--
that
if
you
buy
their
theory
of
a
constitutional
claim,
whatever
constitutional
claim
that
is
is
a
--
a
prosecutorial
function-related
claim,
because
that's
the
nature
of
the
giglio
and
brady
obligation.
they
are
trial
obligations.
they
don't
have
any
meaning
outside
the
context
of
an
actual
prosecution.
and
so,
again
we
submit
that
there
is
really
no
difference
to
the
chief
advocate
or
supervising
advocate
formulating
this
particular
policy
for
all
the
cases
in
the
office
--
this
is
what
we
do
--
then
there
is
the
individual
actions
of
a
particular
trial
attorney
in
a
given
case
or
even
if
it
were
possible
for
a
supervising
attorney
or
chief
advocate
to
participate
in
every
case.
they
could
accomplish
the
same
thing,
i
suppose,
by
every
time
a
case
is
filed
sending
out
an
e-mail
saying:
comply
with
our
policies.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
i
think
that's
right.
reading
the
monell
allegations
of
the
complaint
against
the
county
of
los
angeles,
i
think
that
that
is
what
it
is,
that
the
deputy
--
that
the
district
attorney
rather,
acts
as
a
county
officer
and
would
be
the
policymaker
for
those
policies
and
customs
and
practices.
that
obviously
is
not
at
issue
here.
petitioners
are
being
sued
as
individuals
for
their
acts
as
supervisors
and
as
the
chief
advocate
in
formulating
a
particular
policy
concerning
compliance
with
brady
and
giglio.
these
sort
of
cases,
opening
this
door
particularly
for
the
broad
claim
that
plaintiffs
are
now
trying
to
assert,
which
is
this
kind
of
notion
of
information
management,
can
spawn
all
sorts
of
claims.
virtually
any
time
that
you
can't
reach
the
individual
trial
attorney,
all
you
need
do
is
attribute
whatever
you
think
that
person
did
to
the
failure
to
develop
a
policy
or
provide
training
or
to
have
adequate
data
management
to
allow
them
to
do
the
job.
this
kind
of
end-run
under
imbler
will
create
the
multitude
of
litigation
and
drag
chief
advocates
in,
as
well
as
supervising
advocates,
that
imbler
was
designed
to
avoid.
and
it
has
the
worse
collateral
effect
that
it's
also
going
to
end
up
pulling
in
the
individual
attorneys,
the
individual
trial
attorneys
in
a
given
case,
because
maybe
they
don't
have
individual
liability,
but
they
are
certainly
going
to
come
in;
they
are
going
to
testify
as
witnesses.
so,
it's
the
worst
of
both
worlds,
which
is
you
are
burdening
the
chief
advocate
with
this
sort
of
litigation
which
may
impact
the
way
they
formulate
policy,
and
you
are
burdening
the
individual
line
deputy
attorney,
and
that's
the
attorney
that
imbler
sought
to
protect
as
well.
those
adverse
consequences
on
the
judicial
process
are
what
led
this
court
in
imbler
to
recognize
the
importance
of
absolute
immunity
for
prosecutors.
we
submit
that
it's
even
more
important
that
that
immunity
be
logically
applied
to
chief
advocates
and
to
supervisors.
otherwise,
i
think
imbler
will
be
eviscerated
and
we
will
have
the
very
evils
that
imbler
was
designed
to
avoid.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
some
of
the
court's
comments
have
underscored
the
tension
in
this
case
that
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
claim
here:
that
the
rights
that
were
actually
violated
are
the
giglio
and
brady
rights.
but
the
function
we
are
talking
about
is
the
function
of
complying
with
brady
and
giglio.
you
can
do
it
in
various
fashions.
maybe
it's
a
data
base.
maybe
it's
something
else.
maybe
in
some
cases
it's
even
foreclosing
particular
witnesses
from
testifying
because
you
don't
trust
them.
that
is
essentially
what
the
district
attorney's
policy
is
now.
it
--
it
forecloses
deputy
district
attorneys
from
just,
willy-nilly,
using
jailhouse
informants.
they
have
severe
restrictions
on
what
they
can
do.
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
--
a
policy
that
is
more
directed
to
courtroom
behavior
than
something
that's
caveating
the
discretion
of
a
particular
line
prosecutor
as
to
which
witnesses
they
can
use.
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
a
constitutional
claim
that
the
tighter
they
try
and
draw
not
just
the
causation,
but
the
nature
of
the
obligation
itself
is
tied
to
the
prosecutorial
function.
because
it's
part
of
the
prosecutorial
function
to
assure
the
disclosure
of
exculpatory
information
under
brady
and
--
and
giglio.
and
so
i
would
submit
that
under
imbler
this
court
has
already
held
that
that
conduct
by
an
individual
prosecutor
falls
squarely
within
immunity.
and
i
submit
that
there
is
--
there
is
simply
no
distinction
for
that
kind
of
conduct
when
it's
done
in
the
courtroom
and
that
kind
of
conduct
when
it's
done
in
advance
in
all
cases
by
a
supervising
prosecutor
or
by
a
chief
advocate.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--well,
i
think
it's
hard
for
him
to
get
away
from
the
manner
in
which
he
is
trying
to
characterize
it
as
being
just
administrative
because
it's
not
information
just
sitting
there
in
a
vacuum.
the
key
thing
is
the
policy
that--
mr.
timothy
t.
coates
--i
think
that
is
--
that
is
the
point.
but
i
think
our
point
is
that
trying
to
characterize
that
as
an
administrative
system
strips
it
of
the
--
the
meaning
for
which
you
are
collecting
the
data.
i
mean,
according
to
them,
the
reason
we
have
the
obligation
is
because
of
the
prosecutorial
obligation
under
giglio
and
brady
to
make
sure
that
exculpatory
information
gets
out
there.
so
it's
--
it's
not
just
administrative.
and
i
--
i
assume
if
you
look
at
the
ninth
circuit
decision
--
and
i
--
and
one
of
the
main
focuses
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
the
case
was
not
so
much
that
it
was
merely
administerial.
it
kind
of
reached
that
conclusion
on
this
notion
that
decisions
about
all
cases
are
different
than
decisions
about
a
particular
case.
and
i
think
our
point
is
that,
in
looking
at
the
--
at
the
function
performed
here,
you
can't
make
that
distinction.
that
it
really
--
there
really
isn't
a
distinction.
that
if
you
are
making
a
decision
for
all
cases,
then
you
are
making
a
decision
for
that
particular
case.
there
is
no
difference
from
making
a
policy
in
advance
and
saying
everybody
has
to
follow
it.
and
then,
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
criminal
complaint
is
filed,
and
you
send
out
an
e-mail
saying
comply
with
brady,
or
this
is
how
you
comply
with
brady.
there
is
no
real
difference
there.
