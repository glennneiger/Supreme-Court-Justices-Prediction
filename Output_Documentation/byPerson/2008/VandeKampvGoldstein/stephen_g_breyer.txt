justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
would
like
to
follow
that
up
a
bit
by
saying,
one,
i'm
not
sure
what
this
difference
between
what
you
are
arguing
now
and
what
you
are
arguing
then
matters.
i
don't
understand
it,
frankly.
i
don't
actually
understand
it,
because
i
agree,
when
you
were
in
the
ninth
circuit,
with
what
you
said:
it's
a
failure
to
disseminate
information.
and
then
you
said:
and
it's
a
failure
to
train
and
supervise.
you
did
say
that.
now,
why
that
matters,
i
don't
know,
because
the
problem
that
--
maybe
it
does
matter,
maybe
it
doesn't.
so
i
have
to
say
i
don't
understand
it.
now,
help
my
understanding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
know
you
don't,
but
i'm
not
worried
about
that.
i'm
worried
about
my
understanding
of
your
argument,
and
that's
what
i
am
trying
to
get
to.
answer
this
question,
please,
because
it
will
help
me:
the
obvious
response
is
the
response
the
government
made.
you
can
take
any
--
which
is
what
justice
alito
said.
so
i
would
just
like
to
you
elaborate
on
it.
you
can
take
anything
that
the
d.a.
does
that
is
wrong
in
the
case,
you
know,
some
horrible
thing
he
did.
and
maybe
he
shouldn't
be
immune,
but
he
is,
okay?
or
maybe
he
should
be.
there
we
are.
so,
here
i
know
i
can't
bring
this
suit,
but
here's
what
i
claim:
you
failed
to
have
a
system
that
did.
and
now
we
fill
in
the
blank.
and
whatever
that
blank
is,
it's
going
to
be
something
that
would
have
stopped
him
from
doing
this
bad
thing.
in
your
case,
it
happens
to
be
an
information
dissemination
system.
in
other
case,
it
would
be
some
other
kind
of
system
that
would
have
the
effect
of
stopping
this
bad
thing.
so,
their
point
is
that,
if
you
can
go
ahead
with
yours,
so
can
anybody
else
go
ahead
with
theirs,
and
that
is
the
end
of
immunity.
okay?
now,
what
is
your
response?
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sure,
it's
easy.
what
the
prosecutor
does
is
he
makes
the
most
horrendous
prejudicial
argument
you'd
ever
see.
so
we
say:
what
you
need
in
the
d.a.'s
office,
since
this
happens
all
the
time,
are
classes,
or
what
you
need
is
a
special
section
of
the
library
where
they
have
horrible
arguments
underlined,
okay?
[laughter]
and
so,
i
can
do
that.
so
can
you.
you
are
very
good
at
it.
and
any
good
lawyer
can
do
that.
and
that's
their
point.
so,
if
your
only
response,
that's
your
response,
your
point
is
that
a
good
lawyer,
while
he
can
do
yours,
couldn't
do
others,
i
understand
the
response.
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
suppose
the
distinction
he's
trying
to
make
maybe
--
i'm
not
sure
i've
got
it
right,
but
you
see
there
are
certain
kinds
of
systems
that
maybe
administratively
an
office
ought
to
have.
and
where
it
turns
out
that
this
is
really
an
administrative
system,
a
lot
of
offices
do
have
it,
some
don't,
but
where
it
was
negligent
not
to
have
it
and
the
very
presence
of
it
would
have
prevented
the
--
the
individual
in
the
courtroom
from
behaving
the
way
he
did,
well,
that's
a
separate
kind
of
a
claim.
that's
an
administrative
claim.
just
as
if,
for
example,
suppose
you
had
no
secretary
or
assistants.
he
says,
look,
everybody
should
have
secretarial
assistance.
and
if
only
you
had
secretarial
assistance,
these
people
would
not
have
misread
everything
the
way
they
did
or
would
have
gotten
the
phone
calls
or
would
have
done
something
like
that.
that's
the
kind
of
line
--
so
he's
trying
to
draw
a
line
there
between
something
that
is
pretty
purely
administrative
and
--
and
something
that
is
really
supervisory
and
training.
and
he
is
not
saying
supervisory
and
training.
he
is
saying
that
was
a
separate
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
training
in
today's
world
or
he
wants
to
say
in
that
day's
world,
whatever
it
was.
they
have
information
systems.
they
existed,
and
every
office
ought
to
have
them.
and
now
he
says
i
might
lose
on
that
claim;
but,
nonetheless,
it's
not
the
kind
of
claim
that
falls
within
imbler.
i
think
that's
his
point.
i'm
not
positive.
he
doesn't
have
to
take
my--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thomas
goldstein
was
convicted
of
murdering
at
state
court,
but
after
many
years
of
imprisonment,
he
was
released.
when
federal
court's
found
that
his
trial
was
infected
with
an
important
prosecutorial
error,
namely,
the
prosecution
failed
to
turn
over
to
the
defense,
information
would
have
shown
that
an
informant
who
was
testifying
was
not
reliable.
after
he
was
released,
goldstein
sued
the
prosecution
seeking
damages
under
federal
civil
rights
laws.
but
he
didn't
sue
the
prosecutor's
who
prosecuted
him
with
the
trial,
rather
he
sued
their
supervisors.
and
this
was
probably
for
a
good
reason,
the
reason
he
--
he
probably
didn't
sue
the
trial
prosecutors
is
that
he
couldn't
because
prosecutors
enjoy
an
absolute
immunity
in
such
suits,
whether
they
make
mistakes
or
not.
the
reason
for
that
immunity,
which
is
well
established
in
the
law,
was
explained
by
judge
learned
hand
many
years
ago.
he
said
it
has
been
thought
in
the
end
better
to
leave
unredressed
the
wrongs
done
by
dishonest
officers
than
to
subject
those
who
try
to
do
their
duty
to
the
constant
dread
of
retaliation.
now,
the
question
before
us
here
in
this
case
is
whether
the
same
analysis
and
same
conclusion,
namely,
absolute
immunity
also
applies
to
the
prosecutors
who
administer
the
office
as
well
as
to
those
who
tried
the
case.
we
conclude
that
the
same
analysis
and
conclusion
do
apply
in
the
circumstances
present
here.
now,
what
are
those?
well,
goldstein's
claim
that
the
prosecution,
his
claim
is
that
the
prosecution's
administrative
failures
here
consisted
of
inadequate
supervising,
inadequate
training
and
a
failure
to
set
up
a
proper
information
system
that
would
have
kept
track
of
the
government
informants.
now,
those
three
fault,
all
are
faults
that
relate
directly
to
the
work
and
performance
of
prosecutor's
at
individual
trials.
in
addition,
a
specific
prosecutorial
error
at
goldstein's
individual
trial
was
an
essential
element
of
goldstein's
claim.
he
couldn't
win
without
showing
that.
now,
given
these
circumstances,
we
find
that
all
of
the
considerations
that
support
absolute
immunity
in
the
context
of
a
trial
applied
to
this
case
in
equal
force.
and
we
consequently
hold
that
the
supervising
prosecutors
here
enjoy
absolute
immunity.
we
explain
all
these
further
in
our
opinion
if
you'd
like
more
explanation.
we
reverse
a
ninth
circuit
determination
to
the
contrary.
we
remand
the
case.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
