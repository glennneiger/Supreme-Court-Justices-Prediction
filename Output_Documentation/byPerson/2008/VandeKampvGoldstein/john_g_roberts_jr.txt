chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
07-854,
van
de
kamp
v.
goldstein.
mr.
coates.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
coates.
oh,
excuse
me.
sorry
about
that.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
such
a
constitutional
obligation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
you
have
the
flip
side
of
the
same
problem
your
friend
has.
in
other
words,
the
further
it
is
removed
from
the
constitutional
violation
or
an
allegation
of
a
constitutional
violation,
the
less
need
there
is
for
immunity.
the
closer
it
is
or
the
closer
we
must
assume
it
is
to
a
constitutional
violation,
then
the
immunity
argument
is
stronger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
rosenkranz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
but
that
goes
to
the
merits,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
if
--
i
--
you
could
develop
and
make
the
same
point,
saying
u.s.
attorneys
are
instructed
in
complying
with
giglio
and
brady
in
this
way.
but
if
there
is
a
decision
not
to
--
i
mean,
immunity
is
only
necessary
when
you
assume
some
--
there
has
been
some
violation.
and
so
the
fact
that
somebody
else
avoids
a
violation,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
a
good
argument
to
deprive
other
people
of
immunity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
drew
a
distinction
earlier
on
between
a
determination
by
a
prosecutor
not
to
turn
over
certain
material,
which
is
absolutely
immune,
and
said
this
was
different.
but
what
if
the
purpose
of
the
policy
is
to
not
provide
prosecutors
with
material
so
they
can't
turn
it
over?
why
doesn't
that
go
into
the
same
prosecutorial
core
function?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
that
the
same
as
the
determination
by
the
supervisor
that,
don't
turn
this
information
over.
here's
all
--
we
are
not
going
to
share
informant
information
because
we
don't
think
that
should
be
turned
over
to
comply
with
giglio.
the
individual
prosecutor
they
have
says
i'm
not
going
to
turn
it
over.
why
isn't
it
exactly
the
same?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
was
surprised
by
your
answer
to
justice
stevens's
hypothetical,
because
i
thought
it
undermines
your
case.
you
said
that
you
don't
have
to
show
that
the
data
system
is
unconstitutional.
you
just
have
to
show
that
it
caused
a
constitutional
violation.
but
it
would
cause
a
constitutional
violation
as
applied
in
a
particular
case.
and
you
would
object
to
it
in
that
case,
and
perhaps
all
this
data
sharing
information
system
would
be
very
good
evidence
in
that
case.
look,
he
didn't
turn
over
this
document.
the
reason
he
didn't
turn
it
over
is
because
they've
got
a
policy
of
not
giving
them
the
document.
but
your
objection
would
have
to
be
based
in
a
particular
case.
and
we
have
already
held
that
in
that
case
there
is
absolute
immunity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly.
now,
doesn't
that
just
confirm
the
concern
that
has
been
expressed
that
all
you're
doing
is
circumventing
the
absolute
immunity
we
recognized
at
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
the
data
system,
as
you've
said,
doesn't
cause
a
constitutional
violation.
it's
the
application
of
it
at
trial.
now,
i
know
that's
immune.
you
say,
well,
i'm
going
to
get
around
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
began
this
dialogue
by
suggesting
that
you
don't
--
i
am
saying
--
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
what
you
are
complaining
about
causes
a
--
is
a
constitutional
violation.
you
just
have
to
prove
that
it
causes
a
constitutional
violation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
all
the
examples
you
just
gave
me,
it
seems
to
me
the
allegation
would
be
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
but
that
gets
--
it
seems
to
me
a
fundamental
tension
in
your
case.
when
you
are
talking
about
the
conduct,
you
need
to
link
it
to
a
particular
constitutional
violation.
the
data
system
has
to
be
linked.
but
when
you
are
talking
about
immunity,
you
want
to
say,
oh,
it
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
constitutional
violation.
it's
just
shuffling
paper.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
now,
mr.
coates,
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-854,
van
de
kamp
versus
goldstein.
