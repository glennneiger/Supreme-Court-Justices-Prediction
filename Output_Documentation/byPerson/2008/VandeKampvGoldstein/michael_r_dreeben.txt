mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
recognized
absolute
prosecutorial
immunity
for
line
prosecutors
who
are
charged
with
violating
an
obligation
that
falls
uniquely
on
prosecutors,
namely
the
obligation
to
disclose
exculpatory
evidence.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
seeking
to
circumvent
that
absolute
prosecutorial
immunity
by
reformulating
the
claim
as
one
against
supervisors
who
allegedly
failed
to
fulfill
duties
under
the
constitution
to
collect
information
that
would
enable
the
line
prosecutors
to
comply
with
the
core
duty
under
giglio
and
brady.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
in
our
view,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
our
view
the
brady
obligation
is
one
that
falls
on
the
government.
giglio
is
an
extension
of
brady
with
respect
to
impeachment
information.
it's
designed
to
ensure
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
it
is
violated
only
when
the
government
has
suppressed
material
exculpatory
evidence,
that
is,
evidence
that
can
undermine
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
it's
intimately
linked
in
a
way
that
really
nothing
else
in
the
adversary
system
is
to
preserving
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
it's
an
obligation
on
the
prosecutor
to
go
beyond
the
normal
role
of
an
advocate
to
zealously
advocate
for
his
cause,
and
it
puts
the
advocate
in
the
position
of
supplying
the
judicial
system
with
information
needed
to
be
submitted
in
order
to
have
a
fair
proceeding.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
certainly
is
true
that
if
there
were
a
constitutional
obligation
under
giglio
and
brady,
it
would
be
one
that
is
intimately
tied
to
the
judicial
process,
and
it
should
receive
absolute
prosecutorial
immunity.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
absolutely,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
think
that
a
formulation
of
policies
to
achieve
that,
whether
or
not
required
by
the
constitution,
is
something
that
relates
directly
and
intimately
to
the
prosecutor's
duties
to
assure--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--only
in
the
sense,
i
think,
that
--
that
a
supervisor
who
has
the
power
to
cause
or
prevent
constitutional
violations
may
be
under
some
obligation
not
to
cause
constitutional
violations.
but
the
claim
here
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--you
certainly
should
not.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
i
think
that
the
deliberated
indifference
question
that
you
raise,
justice
kennedy,
is
really
a
direct
counterpart
of
the
absolute
immunity
argument
that
we
are
making
here.
we
are
making
here
the
argument
that
supervisory
prosecutors
should
not
be
subject
to
suit
based
on
broad
policies
that
they
have
adopted
that
will
directly
have
impact
on
individual
cases
in
the
way
that
brady
and
giglio
obligations
are
fulfilled.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
remember
it,
justice
stevens,
and
i
think
that
the
--
i
agree
with
mr.
coates
on
this
one.
the
supervisory
prosecutor
who
formulates
the
policy
is
the
only
one
who
has
the
unique--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
the
allegation,
of
course.
and
the
first
thing
that
i
want
to
say
is
that
if
you
allow
suits
based
on
allegations
that
you
think
are
really
bad,
you
open
the
door
to
allegations
that
will
have
to
be
sorted
out
throughout
the
judicial
system.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
i
think
that
the
point
is
that
the
immunity
prevents
the
prosecutors
from
having
to
fear
that
they
will
be
subject
to
those
kind
of
suits.
but
to
answer
your
question
directly,
the
layperson,
if
he
causes
a
constitutional
violation,
isn't
shielded
by
the
constitutional
--
excuse
me
--
by
the
prosecutorial
immunity
that
attaches
only
to
prosecutors.
and
that's
because
if
you
go
back
to
the
roots
in
imbler,
what
you
see
is
that
prosecutorial
immunity
is
really--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
the
flaw
in
respondent's
theory
is
the
attempt
to
bifurcate
what
the
prosecutor
is
doing
into
an
administrative
function
and
a
prosecutorial
function.
and
that's
the
same,
i
think,
maneuver
in
your
hypothetical,
to
say
that
the
prosecutor
is
really
doing
something
administrative
and
imbler
said
administrative
things
are
non-prosecutorial;
therefore,
we
can
sue
him.
i
think
the
problem
with
that
is
illustrated
by
a
hypothetical
about
judicial
immunity.
suppose
--
judges
of
course
have
immunity
from
sitting
on
cases,
and
if
a
judge
sat
on
a
case
that
involved
a
conflict
of
interest
he
could
not
be
sued
or
she
could
not
be
sued
for
having
done
so,
even
if
it
violated
the
constitution.
suppose
that
the
litigant
reformulated
the
suit
and
said:
well,
the
judge
should
have
had
a
policy
to
ensure
a
check
of
conflicts
in
all
the
cases
that
the
judge
sat
on.
and
that
would
have
been
an
administrative
duty,
set
up
some
notebook
that
has
all
the
judge's
investments
and
direct
some
underling
to
ensure
that
no
party
in
any
case
has
an
interest
where
the
judge
has
an
investment.
that
was
purely
administrative,
so
we
ought
to
be
able
to
sue.
the
judge
for
that.
and
i
think
that
obviously
should
fail.
it
would
end-run
all
of
the
policy
reasons
for
being
able
to
assert
absolute
judicial
immunity;
and
i
think
that
that
is
identical
in
form
to
what
the
respondents
are
trying
to
do
here.
they
are
trying
to
divorce
the
role
of
the
office
in
maintaining
some
sort
of
a
system
to
ensure
that
information
is
available
to
prosecutors
to
disclose
under
giglio
from
the
obligation
under
giglio
to
ensure
the
fairness
of
the
judicial
process,
which
is
an
obligation
that
falls
uniquely
on
the
prosecutor
and
which
imbler
makes
clear
is
subject
to
absolute
immunity.
and
you
just
can't
do
that.
if
you
do
that,
you
end
up
exposing
the
supervisory
prosecutors
to
evils
that
cannot
occur
to
the
line
prosecutor
himself.
and
it
produces
anomalies.
the
line
prosecutor,
even
if
he
intentionally
violates
giglio,
cannot
be
sued,
but
under
respondent's
theory
the
supervisory
prosecutor,
even
if
what
he
did
is
no
more
than
deliberately
indifferent
or
perhaps
even
negligent,
could
be
sued.
the
line
prosecutor
who
handles
a
certain
number
of
cases
cannot
be
sued,
in
part
because
it
would
ensure
a
distraction
of
the
duties
of
the
prosecutor
and
would
divert
him
from
performing
his
role
of
enforcing
the
criminal
law.
the
supervisor,
who
is
responsible
for
far
more
cases
and
is
subject
to
far
more
disappointed
litigants
who
would
like
to
sue
him,
that
person
can
be
sued.
and
it
would
have
an
even
more
disruptive
effect
on
an
office
if
supervisory
prosecutors,
who
have
the
responsibility,
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
of
trying
to
come
up
with
policies
that
will
prevent
constitutional
violations,
and
that
will
ensure
that
the
office
functions
in
an
efficient
and
an
effective
manner,
they
will
be
the
ones
who
are
most
deterred
--
most
deterred
from
acting,
because
they
will
suffer
the
possibility
of
thinking
of
their
own
individual
liability
rather
than
focusing
on
what
they
are
supposed
to
do,
the
public
interest,
both
disclosing
information
that
needs
to
be
disclosed,
bringing
suits
that
need
to
be
brought,
and
using
witnesses
regardless
of
fears
that
someone
later
on
is
going
to
discover
information
that
should
have
been
disclosed
and
sue
the
supervisor,
saying,
"we
know
we
can't
sue
the
individual
prosecutor,
but
you,
supervisor,
failed
to
develop
effective
policies
to
get
that
information
to
the
court.
"
that
kind
of
circumvention
of
imbler
plays
no
role
of
fulfilling
the
policies
that
absolute
prosecutorial
immunity
is
designed
to
fulfill.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
