justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
creating
--
this
is
creating
a
database.
and
what
was
the
year
of
this
prosecution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
back
in
1979
we
did
not
have
the
information-gathering
electronic
capability
that
we
now
have.
so
what
are
we
talking
about?
what
kind
of
database?
how
would
it
operate?
would
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
rosenkranz,
you
have,
it
seems
to
me,
a
theory
of
this
case
that
is
not
the
theory
that
the
ninth
circuit
went
on.
i
mean,
the
ninth
circuit
talks
about
training
and
supervising
deputy
district
attorneys.
and
why
do
we
train
them?
because
we
want
to
ensure
that
they
share
information.
now
you
are
cutting
out
the
training
and
supervision,
and
you
are
saying
the
obligation
of
the
supervising
attorney
is
to
have
this
information
bank,
which
the
deputy
attorneys
can
then
--
then
consult,
which,
may
be
a
very
sound
policy.
but
is
it
an
element
of
due
process
that
the
supervising
attorney
has
to
devise
a
system
to
share
information?
where
is
there
anything
--
anything
that
the
court
has
held
that
suggests
that
there
is
a
data
collection
function
required
by
due
process?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
ninth
circuit
--
there
was
nothing
that
was
presented
to
the
ninth
circuit
by
mr.
goldstein
that
had
to
do
with
this
talk
about
training?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
bottom
line
would
be,
if
you
are
right,
that
every
district
attorney
in
the
country,
large
or
small
office,
would
have
to
have
a
data
bank
that
can
be
shared
by
all
prosecutors,
informants
that
are
used.
that
would
be
the
constitutional
requirement
for
every
supervising
prosecutor
in
the
land.
