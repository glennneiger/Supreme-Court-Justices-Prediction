mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
not
about
whether
a
chief
d.a.
can
set
policies
about
trial
strategy.
we
could
stipulate
that
this
chief
d.a.
would
be
immune
from
those
sorts
of
suits
and
it
would
not
affect
our
case
at
all.
this
case
is
about
the
function
of
deciding
on
an
officewide
basis
whether
to
track
important
historical
facts
and
disseminate
them
internally
within
an
office
to
employees
who
need
to
know
those
facts.
this
case
is
about
gathering
and
preserving
information,
certain
categories
of
raw
data,
that
may
or
may
not
ever
get
into
the
courtroom,
not
about
how
to
use
those
specific
pieces
of
data
once
you
actually
have
a
prosecution
materializing.
this
claim
is
no
different
from
a
claim
against
a
chief
of
police,
for
example,
for
systematically
destroying
911
tapes,
thereby
depriving
defendants
of
exculpatory
information.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
the
prosecution,
your
honor,
was
in
1979,
it
began.
that
was
the
crime;
the
prosecution
was
in
'80.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
your
honor,
so
that's
getting
to
the
merits
of
the
actual
claim.
it
could
be
as
simple
as
a
file
cabinet
or
3
by
5
cards
on
which
you
list
the
name
of
the
informant
and
his
prior
record
of
collaboration.
in
the
u.s.
attorney's
offices
that
do
this,
completely
apart
from
this
enormous
fbi
database,
they
do
it
very
simply,
the
ones
that
i
know
about.
they
appoint
a
giglio
czar
in
each
bureau
and
they
say
that
when
there
is
contact
with
the
prosecutor's
office
and
an
informant,
you
make
sure
you
tell
this
person,
"send
an
e-mail",
and
he
keeps
it
all
in
a
file.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
said
as
clearly
as
it
can
possibly
say
that
the
location
of
the
injury
is
irrelevant.
i
am
quoting
now
from
buckley.
in
kalina,
the
prosecutor
executed
the
challenged
certification
probably
the
morning
before
the
morning
she
walked
into
court,
and
it
was
held
to
be
not
immune
because
that
was
not
the
function
of
a
prosecutor.
she
--
with
the
charging
document.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
your
honor,
the
answer
is
quite
simple.
that
is
the
alleged
motive
in
this
case,
in
fact.
it
was
intentional
or
with
deliberate
indifference,
so
the
allegation
is,
the
intention
was
to
cut
the
flow
of
information
to
the
line
prosecutor.
and
the
reason
that's
different
is
because
while
petitioners
say
compliance
with
brady,
our
answer
is
compliance
with
brady
comprises
at
least
two
functions.
there
is
the
front
line
function
of
the
prosecutor,
the
advocate,
making
the
decision,
"do
i
turn
this
information
over
to
the
defense?
"
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
front
line
function.
this
case
has
to
do
with
the
back
room
function.
the
function
of--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
your
honor,
if
the
decree
comes
from
on
high,
"we
don't
turn
over
giglio
information
here.
"
which
has
actually
happened
in
some
cases,
that
would
be
a
different
case,
because
that
is
the
chief
administrator
directing
trial
tactics.
here
it's
the
chief
administrator
looking
entirely
inward
and
saying,
like
any
administrator
in
any
major
agency
or
business
does,
how
do
we
get
information
from
the
people
who
know
it
to
the
people
who
need
it
at
the
front
line?
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
that's
what--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
the
passage
you
read
from
was
the
broad
passage
that
the
court
was
referring
to
when
it
said
this
sets
up
a
bunch
of
hard
questions.
this
case
becomes
an
easy
case,
the
court
said,
because
we
were
not
dealing
with
the
prosecutor,
the
chief
d.a.
setting
trial
tactics
for
the
line
prosecutors;
we
are
dealing
--
the
court
says
this
on
page
5
of
the
petition
--
excuse
me,
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
page
5
of
the
petition
appendix
at
the
top.
it
lays
out
the
theories.
number
one
theory
is
exactly
the
theory
we
are
presenting
here.
at
the
very
top
line,
"they
violated
his
constitutional
rights
by
purposely
or
with
deliberate
indifference
failing
to
create
a
system
that
would
satisfy
the
giglio
obligation.
"
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
no,
they
--
the
court
was
very
clear
that
it
was
talking
about
supervising
and
training,
about
the
internal
function
of
circulation
of
information
within
the
d.a.'s
office.
not--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--and
he's
directing
that
order
to
trial
lawyers?
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
the
answer
is
i
don't
know.
i
could
imagine
a
theory,
a
very
strong
one--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--there
absolutely
would,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
and
my
point
is--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
i
can
imagine
an
argument
on
either
side.
i
can
imagine
the
plaintiff
making
the
argument--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--i
don't
have
an
answer
to
that
hypothetical
because
it's
so
different
from
our
case.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
if--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
your
honor,
that
may
well
be
a
consequence
of
imbler.
but
when
imbler
talks
about
the
function,
imbler
is
very
clear
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
trial
tactics
and
strategy
on
the
one
hand
in
the
cases
under
imbler,
and
the
sort
of
backroom
functions
about
the
flow
of
information
on
the
other--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--sure,
your
honor.
we
can
--
if
we
imagine
a
corrupt
district
attorney
who
wants
to
make
sure
that
constitutional
rights
are
violated
and
evades
the
edict
of
this
court,
sure,
that
is
the
consequence
of
imbler.
but
my
point
in
--
in
not
answering
the
question
about
the
theory
under
that
case,
is
that
the
argument
of
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
is
so
different
from
the
argument
that
we
are
making
here.
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
would
be
arguing,
well,
it
is
removed
in
time
from
the
--
the
actual
prosecution
which
is
an
argument
that
we,
too,
can
make.
the
conduct
was
before
the
initiation
of
criminal
proceedings.
it's
not
--
you
know,
you
could
not
say
it's
not
unique
to
prosecutors.
here,
our
argument
is
that
there
is
nothing
unique
to
prosecutors
or
to
lawyers
about
the
information
management
function,
about
the
function
of
tracking
information.
and
by
the
way,
this
is
not
an
exotic
theory.
this
is
exactly
the
line
that
this
court
has
been
following
in
distinguishing
between--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--i
can
see
the
plaintiff
in
a
case
using
our
argument
to
advance
that
point.
but
my
point
here
is
we
don't
even
need
to
get
to
that
argument
because--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--as
i
said--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--i
--
i
believe
that
there
is
an
argument.
it's
not
the
argument
that
i
am
making.
the
argument
that
i
am
making
it
matters
what
the
d.a.
is
training
on.
if
the
d.a.
is
training
on
trial
tactics,
that's
one
thing.
but
here
the
d.a.
is
training
on
how
to
use
a
database,
and
he's
not
training
the
lawyers
who
are
going
to
be
using
it.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
so,
your
honor,
let
me
ask
--
let
me
answer
the
first
half
first,
which
is
about
what
the
ninth
circuit
held.
and
first,
i
should
say
what
it
is
that
we
argued
to
the
ninth
circuit.
it's
on
--
it's
in
our
brief,
very
clearly
we've
presented
on
page
--
excuse
me
--
on
page
17
of
our
brief,
that
big
paragraph,
the
only
full
paragraph,
we
present
both
what
we
argued
to
the
ninth
circuit,
which
was
about
the
creation
of
a
database,
and
what
petitioners
argued
to
the
ninth
circuit,
which
reflected
exactly
what
we
were
saying.
so
petitioners
were
not
confused.
they
attributed
to
us
the
argument
that
they,
quote,
failed
to
set
up
a
system
to
disseminate
to
deputy
district
attorneys
information
about
plea
deals
and
other
assistance
being
offered
to
informants.
that
was
--
and
that
was
directly
out
of
our
brief.
that
was
the
first
line
of
their
brief,
and
the
first
line
of
our
brief
also
referred
to
that.
i
agree,
the
ninth
circuit
spoke
more
about
training
than
about
this
information
database.
but
the
ninth
circuit
was
also
speaking
only
about--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--there
was,
your
honor.
in
our
complaint
we
had
two
what
might
be
called
information
management
theories.
one
--
and
you
can
see
it
on
page
45
of
our
complaint
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
so
while
the
court
is
orienting
itself
--
there
were
--
there's
a
theory
of
information
management
that
is
the
most
prominent
theory
in
the
complaint.
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
of
page
45,
about
seven
lines
up
from
the
bottom,
you
see
two
distinct
kind
of
subtheories.
the
first
is
--
so
it
starts
--
the
line
starts
purposely
or
with
a
deliberate
indifference
--
theory
1-a,
that
petitioners
failed
to
create
any
system
for
the
deputy
district
attorneys
handling
criminal
cases
to
access
information,
about
informants,
of
course.
theory
b,
two
lines
from
the
bottom,
"that
they
failed
to
train
deputy
district
attorneys
to
disseminate
information
pertaining
to
the
benefits
provided
to
jailhouse
informants.
"
that's
also
about
disseminating
it
internally.
if
one
turns
to
page
69,
the
specific
allegations
against
petitioners,
you
see
paragraph
154,
repeatedly
talking
about
this
information
system,
this
information
sharing
system,
both
as
a
system
to
create
and
as
a
failure
to
train.
but,
again,
train
on
what?
train
on
the
need,
when
you
don't
have
the
system,
to
inform
the
other
guy
that
you've
just
made
a
deal
with
the
informant.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
i
don't
think
it
does
matter.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
my
response
to
that
is
very
simple:
i
don't
know
of
any
other
trial
right
--
prosecutorial
misconduct,
that
can
be
controlled
--
excuse
me,
where
you
can
evade
immunity
under
our
theory
the
way
you
can
with
a
theory
that
is
based
on
the
management--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor,
and
i
was
beginning
to
say
before
that
there
is
nothing
at
all
exotic
about
the
theory.
the
same
lines
are
being
drawn
by
this
court
all
the
time.
for
example,
in
kalina,
a
very
fine
line
between
the
prosecutor
who
is
creating
charging
documents
on
the
one
hand,
writing
them,
submitting
them
to
the
court,
and
then
on
the
other
hand,
signing
them.
or,
in
the
investigative
cases,
the
line
between
the
process
of
gathering
information,
the
raw
data,
on
the
one
hand;
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
assessment
of
that
data
for
trial.
and
so,
when
you
are
talking
about
a
prosecutor
and
trying
to
hold
the
district
attorney
vicariously
liable
for
decisions
of
a
trial
lawyer,
that
is
just
very
different
from
trying
to
hold
the
district
attorney
liable
for
the
process
of
managing
data,
raw
information,
that
may
or
may
not
ever
make
its
way
into
a
courtroom.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
any
one
that
is
constitutionally
based,
your
honor.
i
mean,
one
where
you
could
imagine
a
prosecution
on
the
other
end
with
a
constitutional
right
that
is
violated.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
you
have
to
imagine
a
world
in
which
the
district
attorney
is
depriving
people
of
the
tools
of
their
trade
so
that
they
can't
get
it
elsewhere.
there
is
actually
a
real
case
that
i
--
that
i've
heard
about
where,
you
know,
the
district
attorney
decided
way
back
when
to
stop
buying
supplements
for
statutory
--
for
statute
books,
and
so
district
attorneys,
line
prosecutors
were
charging
under
the
wrong
statutes.
that,
to
me
your
honor,
is
a
commissary
function.
it
is
a
function
of
an
administrator
trying
--
making
decisions
about
how
to
arm
the
trial
lawyer.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
you
are
asking
whether
the
policy--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--that
such
a
cause
of
action--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--in
the
absence
of
a
constitutional
injury?
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
your
honor,
i
am
aware
of
any
such
case,
but
i
will
say--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--your
honor,
it's
actually
not,
and
i
will
tell
you
why.
our
--
we
do
not
have
to
allege,
for
a
1983
case,
that
the
conduct
complained
of
was
unconstitutional.
all
we
have
to
allege
was
that
the
conduct
caused
a
constitutional
violation.
so,
for
1983
purposes,
this
case
is
a
case
--
most
clearly,
most
prominently
our
theory
would
be
that
this
case
is
a
case
in
which
the
district
attorney
was
aware
of
this
market
bazaar
atmosphere
of
trading
in
illegal
--
excuse
me
--
in
perjured
jailhouse
confessions
and
did
nothing
to
intervene.
it's
sort
of
a
classic
hanton
claim.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
giglio
imposes
the
--
or
puts
the
district
attorneys
on
notice
as
to
what
they
ought
to
be
doing.
but
the
constitutional
requirement
would
be
when
you
were
aware
of
strong
warnings
of
this
bizarre
atmosphere
in
which
jailhouse
confessions
are
being
used
in
this
way,
and
you
are
aware
that
lawyers
on
one
side
of
the
office
don't
know
what
lawyers
on
the
other
side
of
the
office
are
doing,
then,
yes,
you
are
deliberately
indifferent
to
the
constitutional
violations.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is
true
of
almost
every
prosecutorial
immunity
case.
the
injury
almost
always
happens
when
the
lapse
materializes
in
injury
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
your
honor,
not
any
more--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
not
any
more,
your
honor,
than
buckley
or
burns
were
circumnavigating
around
imbler.
i
mean
in
those
cases,
the
constitutional
violations
--
excuse
me
--
the
acts
that
were
being
challenged
were
fabricating
evidence.
why?
the
only
purpose
for
fabricating
the
evidence
was
to
produce
it
in
the
courtroom.
giving
legal
advice
to
extract
a
confession
in
a
particular
way.
the
only
purpose
was
to
use
that
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
right,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
not
--
under
cedank,
your
honor,
it
was
not
--
it
would
not
be
a
constitutional
violation
to
extract
a
confession
from
someone
until
that
confession
is
used
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
right.
it
is
because
the
functional
approach
--
for
purposes
of
a
functional
approach,
you
never
look
at
the
case
through
the
lens
of
a
constitutional
violation.
you
look
at
it
through
the
lens
of
the
conduct
that's
being
challenged.
so
that's
what,
for
example,
this
court
did
in
kalina.
the
constitutional
violation
occurred
in
the
courtroom,
but
the
lens
that
the
court
looked
at
it
through
was
the
specific
conduct
where
this
court
said--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is
always
true
in
an
immunity
case.
it
is
always
true
that
the
--
that
the
injury
materializes
in
the
courtroom.
and
this
court
said
in
buckley
and
in
burns
it
