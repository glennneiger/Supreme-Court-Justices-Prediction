justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
kind
of
perhaps
a
farfetched
hypothetical
question
just
so
i
get
the
case
law
in
mind?
supposing
a
prosecutor
wanted
to
develop
a
policy
which
would
keep
--
which
would
create
a
bifurcated
regime
within
the
office
where
the
people
who
interrogate
prisoners
are
entirely
separate
from
the
people
who
prosecute
trials,
so
that
they
don't
have
the
malicious
purpose
that
your
adversary
says
is
involved
in
this
case.
and
supposing
the
prosecutor
then
hired
some
expert
layman
who
had
no
trial
experience
at
all
to
develop
such
a
program,
and
the
program,
itself,
is
desirable
from
the
prosecution's
point
of
view
but
--
but
presumably
unconstitutional.
would
the
person
who
developed
that
program
be
entitled
to
immunity--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
my
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
--
why
is
it
qualified
immunity
if
a
separate
person
does
it,
but
not
qualified
immunity
if
precisely
the
same
task
is
performed
by
somebody
who
happens
also
to
be
a
prosecutor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
my
hypothetical
is
it
or
is
it
not
a
prosecutorial
--
does
the
layperson
perform
or
not
perform
a
prosecutorial
function?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
trying
to
divorce
the
information
in
the
particular
case
from
developing
the
program.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it's
made
by
a
layman?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben,
what
do
you
do
with
my
hypothetical?
do
you
remember
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
--
my
hypothetical
is
they
hire
a
layman--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
develop
a
policy
that
will
keep
separate
from
prosecutors
information
about
the
way
witnesses
are
developed.
and
the
policy
i
think
is
highly
unprobable,
i
agree
with
you,
but
the
policy
is
designed
to
avoid
the
obligation
imposed
by
giglio
and
brady.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
true
even
without
--
without
an
immunity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
next
question
is,
if
that's
true,
and
if
there
is
--
you
can
compartmentalize
the
prosecutor's
work
in
the
office
and
he
develops
a
separate
chapter
of
his
own
duty
to
just
do
that
performance,
why
is
that
trial-related?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
know
we
have
an
immunity
case,
but
your
underlying
cause
of
action,
the
one
you
just
described,
the
policy
there
of
not
filing
supplements,
or
say
you
had
a
policy
of
training
lawyers
how
to
evade
the
batson
issue.
there
are
all
sorts
of
troublesome
policies
that
might
be
developed.
are
you
aware
of
any
case
in
which
the
court
has
held
that
such
a
policy
can
be
challenged
in
the
abstract,
in
the
--
as,
sort
of,
on
its
face,
rather
than
as
applied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
policy
when
they
--
when
they
deny
someone
his
giglio
rights
or
so
on
and
so
on.
have
you
had
any
cases
like
this
one
in
which
a
court
has
held
that
such
a
cause
of
action
is
available
against
an
office
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
be
brought
under
1983
for
such
a
general
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
it
will
produce
on
a
regular
basis
constitutional--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--then
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
the
absolute
immunity
question
is
harder
than
the
question
that
you
present
on
the
merits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
client's
standing
to
challenge
this
whole
policy
is
the
fact
that
he
was
the
victim
of
the
--
of
the
use
of
the
policy
in
a
particular
case
for
which
the
prosecutor
has
absolute
immunity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
think
you
told
me
earlier
that
there
are
no
prior
cases
in
which
such
--
a
person
who
suffered
such
an
injury
can
bring
an
independent
1983
case
challenging
the
policy
at
large.
