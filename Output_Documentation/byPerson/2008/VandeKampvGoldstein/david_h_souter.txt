justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
that's
--
that's
what
they
did
mean.
i
have
to
say
i
read
it
as
broadly
as
justice
scalia
did,
but
let's
--
let's
narrow
down
the
--
the
court's
opinion
to
--
to
--
to
the
claim
that
you
are
making
right
now.
let
me
go
back
to
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
and
add
one
minor
detail.
let's
assume
that
in
a
given
department
they
put
into
effect
exactly
the
policy
that
you
want.
they
have
a
fine
system
of
--
of
data
collection,
far
more
sophisticated
than
three
by
five
cards,
and
the
--
the
boss
d.a.
says
everybody
in
this
office
ought
to
know
what
kind
of
deals
are
being
made
and
offered
at
all
times.
and
they
have
such
a
system.
and
the
boss
d.a.
also
says
and
don't
you
disclose
one
word
of
it
ever
in
any
case.
we
are
going
to
defy
giglio.
if
he
made
that
or
gave
that
order
so
that
in
every
case
there
would
be
a
defiance
of
giglio,
even
though
the
facts
were
known,
would
he
have
absolute
immunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
know
if
in
a
given
case,
if
they
had
this
system,
and
the
lawyer
comes
to
him
and
says,
okay,
i've
consulted
our
system
and
i
realize
we
that
have
got
a
giglio
obligation.
and
the
boss
d.a.
says:
forget
it.
don't
tell
him
a
word.
there
would
be
absolute
immunity,
wouldn't
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
would
the
--
why
would
the
answer
be
any
different
if
he
says
don't
bother
me
with
particular
cases?
i
am
telling
you
right
now
what
the
answer
is
going
to
be
in
every
case
in
which
we
have
a
giglio
obligation
and
that
is,
bury
it.
presumably
there
would
be
absolute
immunity,
wouldn't
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
trouble
is
if
you
don't
have
an
answer
to
that
hypothetical,
then
we
got
to
leave
open
the
possibilities
as
far
as
your
case
is
concerned
that
he
would
have
absolute
immunity
in
that
case.
and
if
he
would
have
absolute
immunity
in
that
case,
then
the
--
the
--
the
reason
for
allowing
anything
less
than
absolute
immunity
with
respect
to
this
data
collection
obligation
reduces
down
to
something
like
an
almost
a
silly
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
can
get
everything
you
want,
and
all
the
prosecutor
has
got
to
say
is:
keep
it
under
your
hat
and
there
is
going
to
be
absolute
immunity
and
nobody
gets
anything.
what
is
--
what
is
to
be
gained
by
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the
backroom
function
is
reduced
to
an
absolute
nullity
by
an
immunized
decision
to
--
to
bury
the
giglio
information
in
every
case,
then
i
don't
see
the
point
of
saying
there's
no
immunity
for
the
supposed
backroom
function,
because
nothing
will
be
accomplished
even
if
there
is
no
absolute
immunity.
