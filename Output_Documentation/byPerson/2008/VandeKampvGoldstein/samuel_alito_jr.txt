justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can't
you
say
anything
about
training
subordinates
in
any
office.
there
is
nothing
unique
about
training
or
not
training
subordinates
in
a
prosecutor's
office
as
opposed
to
any
other
government
office
or,
i
would
suppose,
an
office
in
the
private
sector.
so
does
your
argument
extend
to
any
failure
to
provided
adequate
training
or
any
instance
where
there
is
a
deliberate
indifference
as
to
the
training
that
is
provided?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
a
plaintiff
could
say
that
it
could
sue
a
--
a
district
attorney
for
failing
to
have
adequate
training
as
to
subordinates
before
you
--
they
are
sent
in
to
deliver
a
summation
so
that
they
know
they
are
not
supposed
to
comment
on
the
failure
of
a
defendant
to
take
the
stand--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--they
are
not
supposed
to
vouch
for
witnesses,
that
would
be
a
viable
theory
in
your
opinion?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
theory
applies
to
any
system
of
data
dissemination.
is
that
--
would
that
be
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
prosecutor
has
the
policy
of
failing
to
distribute
to
the
line
attorneys
the
latest
ninth
circuit
decision
or
the
latest
decisions
of
this
court
on
important
issues
of
criminal
constitutional
procedure,
because
they
just
don't
like
the
way
the
law
is
developing
in
these
areas.
so
they
like
the
law
the
way
it
existed
at
sometime
in
the
past,
and
they
are
just
not
going
to
distribute
any
of
that.
would
that
be
a
theory?
