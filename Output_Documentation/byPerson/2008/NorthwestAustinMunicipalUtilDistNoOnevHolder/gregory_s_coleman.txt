mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
after
more
than
20
years
of
steadfast
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act,
northwest
austin
mud
number
one
is
entitled
to
be
free
from
the
intrusive
burdens
of
preclearance.
the
district
is
entitled
to
seek
a
bailout
because
it
is
a
political
subdivision
under
the
court's
decisions
in
sheffield
and
dougherty
county.
this
natural
parallelism
between
bailout
and
preclearance
allows
bailout
to
serve
its
ameliorative
purposes
of
encouraging,
recognizing,
and
rewarding
long-term
compliance
and
progress--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
we
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
under
dougherty
county
in
particular,
the
court
specifically
recognized
that
these
entities
such
as
cities
and
school
boards
and
utility
districts
are
political
subdivisions
and
that
that
term
as
it's
used--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--justice
ginsburg,
the
term
"governmental
unit"
doesn't
actually
appear
in
the
provision
that
authorizes
bailout.
what
it
says
is
that
when
a
political
subdivision
seeks
a
bailout
that,
if
it
has
any
governmental
units
within
it,
it
must
also
ensure
that
they
are
compliant
before
it
can
have
a
bailout.
for
instance,
although
the
district
is
not
a
political
subdivision
of
the
county,
it
is
in
the
county,
and
therefore
under
the
substantive
criteria,
if
the
(.)
travis
county
wanted
to
bail
out,
it
would
have
to
demonstrate
compliance
of
all
of
those
governmental
units
within
it.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
again,
i
disagree
with
your
honor
that
(.)
that
the
term
"governmental
unit"
appears
in
the
provision
that
defines
criteria.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
again,
the
statute
that
defines
who's
eligible
to
bailout
says
a
state,
a
political
subdivision
that
has
been
separately
designated
for
coverage
under
4(b),
and
a
political
subdivision
that
has
not
been
separately
designated
for
coverage.
we
were
never
separately
designated
for
coverage.
and
under
sheffield
and
dougherty
county,
we
have
long
been
considered
a
political
subdivision.
indeed,
we
are
subject
to
the
process
of
preclearance
only
because
we
were
a
political
subdivision.
the
actual
requirement
that
you
send
in
preclearance
submissions
is
on
political
subdivisions.
we
are
subject
to
lawsuits
under
section
2
because
we
are
a
political
subdivision.
we
are
subject
to
the
possibility
of
federal
examiners
because
we
are
a
political
subdivision.
at
no
place
in
this
voting
rights
act,
in
any
of
the
dozens
of
the
uses
of
the
term
"political
subdivision"
has
this
court
or
congress,
other
than
the
designation
statute,
separately
suggested
that
a
political
subdivision
such
as
the
district
would
not
be
considered
a
political
subdivision
under
the
terms
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well,
certainly
we
believe
that
the
purposes
of
the
act
suggest
that
we
should
be
considered
a
political
subdivision
eligible
to
bail
out.
this
interaction
between
the
county
and
the
district
(.)
we
(.)
we
exist
within
the
county,
but
we
are
not
part
of
the
county.
the
county,
as
we
say,
is
not
the
boss
of
us.
they
don't
have
any
way
to
ensure
or
require
us
to
do
things.
and
as
the
facts
of
this
case
demonstrate,
not
only
did
the
county
have
different
political
interests,
but
we've
also
demonstrated
that
because
you
have
entities
that
are
subject
to
separate
designation,
like
the
county,
that
have
dozens
and
perhaps
in
this
case
over
a
hundred
separate
political
subdivisions,
travis
county
could
never
practically
seek
a
bail
out.
and
in
order
to
give
effect
to
what
i
call
this
ameliorative
purpose
to
bail
out,
the
court
should
interpret
the
statute
in
a
way
that
allows
these
small
entities
to
bail
out.
these
small
entities--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
i
(.)
i
(.)
again,
the
court
doesn't
need
to
reach
that
question
yet,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
answer
is
that
we
clearly
couldn't
if
we
were
a
separately
designated
or
(.)
excuse
me
(.)
if
we
were
in
a
separately
designated
county
that
says
(.)
that's
it's
not
in
a
covered
state,
right?
there
is
this
argument,
for
instance,
that
(.)
that
that
state
could
be
covered
in
whole
or
in
part.
and
certainly,
for
instance,
in
california
the
state
is
(.)
is
covered
in
part.
and
it
could
be
resolved
in
that
way.
the
statute
is
not
exceptionally
clear
on
it,
but
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
that
because
we
are
in
a
fully
covered
state,
and
we
are
(.)
under
all
the
provisions
of
voting
rights
act,
have
always
been
considered
political
subdivisions.
the
district
court
said
you're
a
political
subdivision
for
every
purpose
except
this
one.
you
have
to--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
don't
know
that
there
was
a
specific
legislative
proposal,
justice
ginsburg.
there
was
certainly
some
discussion
of
that.
what
(.)
what
is
particularly
clear
is--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
don't
know
that
the
record
actually
shows
that
it
was
resisted.
it
was
simply
part
of
the
discussion
during
the
reauthorization
proceedings.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
specific
resistance
relating
to
that.
there
weren't
any
amendments
to
the
statute,
but
the
amendments
in
1982,
we
do
believe
are
very
important
to
the
court's
consideration
of
that
because
the
bailout
aspects
were
considered
in
city
of
rome,
and
in
city
of
rome
the
only
entities
that
could
bail
out
were
a
(.)
were
a
state
or
a
separately
covered
or
a
separately
designated
subdivision.
and
then
2
years
after
that,
congress
amends
the
statute
to
add
this
third
category,
which
is
political
subdivisions
that
have
not
been
separately
designated
for
coverage.
that
amendment
and
that
addition
is
clearly
in
direct
response
to
city
of
rome
and,
we
believe,
a
clear
indication
that
congress
did
intend
and,
indeed,
it
said
it
intended
to
expand
the
bailout
opportunities.
congress
believed
that
many,
if
perhaps
not
most,
political
subdivisions
in
1982
would
be
eligible
for
bailout,
but
because--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
but
unlike
the
attorney
general's
regulations
that
relate
to
preclearance,
bailout
is
not
something
that
the
attorney
general
actually
has
any
specific
say
in.
the
statute
provides
for
a
lawsuit
to
seek
a
bailout.
it's
not
like
preclearance,
where
can
you
get
it
from
either
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
court.
now,
the
attorney
general
may
choose,
as
it
has
for
several
of
the
virginia
entities,
not
to
resist
that.
so
you
can
file
a
friendly
suit
once
the
attorney
general
has
been
convinced,
but--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
with
respect
to
our
constitutionality
issue,
justice
kennedy,
one
thing
nobody
is
contesting
here
is
that
we
are
not
subject
to
preclearance.
and
so,
if
we
are
not
eligible
for
bailout,
we
obviously
do
and
we
believe
have
standing
to
assert
that
the
reenactment
of
the
preclearance
provisions
is
unconstitutional
because
they,
unlike
the
bailout,
would
clearly
continue
to
apply
to
us.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well,
we
didn't
seek
a
preclearance--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
there
is
certainly
a
possibility
we
may
seek
to
preclear
things
in
the
future,
but
this
is
primarily--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--no,
justice
souter.
this
is
primarily
a
facial
challenge
to
the
statute.
we
are
subject
to
the
obligations
of
preclearance.
and
we
believe
that
we--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
agree
with
(.)
i
disagree
with
that
as
well,
justice
souter.
while
it
has
not
been
highlighted
in
the
briefs,
there
is
deep
in
the
record
discussion
during
a
mud
board
meeting
of
potentially
some
changes,
and
discussion
on
that
was
table
pending
the
outcome
of
this
lawsuit.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
the
contract
in
2004
by
which
we
asked
the
county
to
actually
perform
the
elections
itself,
that
was
precleared,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
that's
correct.
this
lawsuit--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
do
think
you're
wrong
about
that,
justice
souter.
we
had
not
been
denied
bailout.
the
suit
sought
bailout.
the
only
way
to
seek
a
bailout
is
through
the
lawsuit--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--and
this
lawsuit
seeks
the
bailout
and
the
declaratory
judgment
that
if
we
cannot
bail
out--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--yes.
there
are
different
claims
in
the
lawsuit,
your
honor.
and
indeed,
the
standing
point
is--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
that's
not
exactly
right
either,
justice
ginsburg.
we
certainly
contest
and
contend
that
preclearance
is
unconstitutional.
we
acknowledge
that
if
the
court
were
to
give
us
bailout
that
the
court
might
choose
on
its
own
not
to
reach
the
constitutional
issues
because
we
would
receive
relief.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
no.
we
do
not
say
that
the
modification
would
make
the
statute
constitutional.
our
position
is
both
that
we
are
entitled
to
bailout
and
we
have
an
alternative
claim
that
we
have
asserted
that
is
independent,
it's
not
dependent
on
the
first
one,
that
preclearance
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
do
acknowledge
that,
justice
souter.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
right.
but
because
we
had
all
the
claims
together
in
one
lawsuit,
we
had
to
assert
them
all
together,
and
that's
what
we've
done.
getting
to
the
heart
of
this
preclearance
issue,
if
i
may,
katzenbach
recognized
that
preclearance
really
was
an
extraordinary
remedy
and
it
recognized
that
is
a
remedy
that
would
not
otherwise
be
appropriate
but
for
the
extraordinary
emergency
circumstances
that
existed
at
the
time.
nobody
has
challenged
that.
but
we
are
in
a
different
day.
the
kinds
of--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--our
answer,
your
honor,
is
(.)
is
a
very
clear
one
and
that
is
there
is
a
difference
between
a
nondiscrimination
statute
and
a
noncircumvention
statute.
section
2,
section
203,
the
prohibition
on
the
uses
of
tests
and
devices,
these
are
clear
nondiscrimination
provisions
that
are
textually
linked
back
to
the
(.)
to
the
constitutional
prohibitions.
section
5
was
never
intended
to
be
a
nondiscrimination
statute.
section
5
is
a
noncircumvention
statute,
notwithstanding
the
volume--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
honestly
disagree
with
you,
justice
souter,
on
that.
notwithstanding--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--justice
ginsburg,
the
court
in
katzenbach
recognized
that
congress
had
been
trying
for
several
years
to
try
to
fix
this
problem
and
it
walked
through,
as
this
court
has
walked
through
innumerable
times,
that
section
5
is
simply
not
about
nondiscrimination,
but
it
was
about
the
unremitting
and
ingenious
defiance
of
statutes
in
a
way
that
made
ordinary
enforcement
mechanisms,
including
litigation,
simply
ineffective,
that
no
matter
what
the
courts
did,
in
the
south
the
enforcement
mechanisms
were
unable
to
allow
minority
individuals
to
register
and
get
out
and
vote,
that
no
matter
what
happened
(.)
preclearance
put
a
stop
to
that.
but
notwithstanding
this
record,
which
i'd
like
to
speak
to
the
volume
of
separately--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--notwithstanding
that
record,
it
is
not
the
kind
of
record
(.)
congress
put
together
what
it
believed
was
a
discrimination
record,
but
not
a
circumvention
record.
there
is
no
indication,
for
instance,
in
these
types
of
examples
that
have
been
offered
in
the
briefs
and
were
offered
in
the
congressional
hearings
that
these
aren't
things
that
can
be
fixed
through
ordinary
enforcement
mechanisms
through
section
2
litigation.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
two
points
on
that,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
with
respect
to
the
waller
county
issue,
that
was
an
issue
that
was
very
swiftly
addressed
by
texas
officials
itself
in
cooperation
with
the
naacp.
the
texas
secretary
of
state
and
the
texas
attorney
general
came
down
very
swiftly
on
that
issue.
the
second
point
is--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--and
that
gets
at
the
heart
of
one
of
our
arguments,
justice
ginsburg.
that
is--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
i'm
obviously
not
going
to
have
time
to
respond
to
all
of
that,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
but,
for
instance,
with
respect
to
the
first
point
that
you
raised,
which
is
voter
registration
and
turnout
issues,
those
numbers
don't
tell
the
whole
story.
in
fact
(.)
in
fact,
with
respect
to
both
black
and
hispanic
voters,
the
record
in
covered
jurisdictions
is
above
the
national
average.
massachusetts,
for
instance,
you
might
be
learned
to
know,
has
a
white-black
voter
registration
and
turnout
differential
that
is
in
the
high
20s,
far
in
excess
of
any
covered
jurisdiction.
and
that's
part
of
what
congress
didn't
do.
so
in
addition
to
the
argument
we
have
that
the
record
congress
produced
is
really
a
nondiscrimination
record
and
not
a
circumvention
record,
we
also
have
the
argument
that
we've
made
that
it
is
simply
irrational
for
congress
to
go
back
and
say
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
was
intended
to
make
sure
that
minority
voters
could
register
and
vote
and
that's
going
to
be
our
number
one
priority.
as
justice
ginsburg
recognized,
congress
believes
that
that
has
been
satisfied.
but
now
we
are
going
to
go
back
and
in
determining
who's
going
to
be
covered
under
the
2006
amendment,
we
are
going
to
use
the
same
data
from
the
1964
election.
it
would
have
been
as
if
congress
in
1965
said:
we
anticipate
that
there
are
problems
here;
and,
in
order
to
define
coverage,
we
are
going
to
look
at
the
roosevelt-hoover
election
in
1932
and
registration
and
turnout
then,
because
we
think
that
is
the
best
way
to
evaluate--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that's--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--the
only
comparative
data
that
existed
was
of
two
kinds.
there
was
a
(.)
there
was
a
(.)
some
data
that
grouped
all
covered
jurisdictions
into
one
lump
and
all
noncovered
jurisdictions
into
another
lump
and
counted
up
section
2
lawsuits.
and
the
difference
was
about
17
successful
(.)
17
more
successful
section
2
suits
in
covered
jurisdictions
than
in
noncovered
jurisdictions.
that's
not
a
big
difference.
what
congress
didn't
do,
though,
is
look
at
specific
noncovered
jurisdictions,
for
instance,
the
ones
i've
cited,
and
say,
how
do
these
compare
to
covered
jurisdictions?
and
the
other
thing
it
didn't
do
is
say:
among
covered
jurisdictions
and
noncovered
jurisdictions,
let's
look
among
(.)
let's
separate
out
among
these
jurisdictions
and
see
where
the
problem
locations
are
and
what
areas
we
think
might,
if
(.)
if
preclearance
is
going
to
be
constitutional,
might
be
subject.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
that.
preclearance
once
again
is
based
on
the
results
(.)
well,
whether
there
was
a
test
or
device
in
the
1960s
and
the
results
of
the
1964,
1968,
and
1972
presidential
elections.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well,
just
to
give
one
example
(.)
and
i'm
not
(.)
not
recommending
this
(.)
but
if,
for
instance,
the
same
coverage
formula
had
been
applied
to
the
2000
and
2004
elections,
equalizing
for
citizen
voting
age
population,
the
only
covered
state
would
have
been
hawaii.
under
that
formula,
using
modern
data,
modern
information,
none
of
these
states
would
have
been
covered
if
you
account
for
noncitizen
voting
age
population.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
wouldn't
say
quite
a
bit,
your
honor.
what
it
did
is
it
lumped
all
covered
jurisdictions
together
and
all
noncovered
jurisdictions.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
(.)
i
actually
dispute
that.
there
is
a
lot
of
discussion
of
that
information,
your
honor,
but
it's
not
that
much
information.
and,
again
it
doesn't
(.)
it
doesn't
take
into
account
any
attempt
to
say:
how
does
the
panhandle
of
texas
do
against
florida,
against
parts
of
northeast
georgia
or
northwest
alabama?
how
are
these
(.)
it
makes
no
attempt
whatsoever.
it
is
simply
all
covered
jurisdictions
as
a
lump
and
all
noncovered
jurisdictions
as
a
lump,
and
congress
had
no
basis
to
make
that
(.)
that
declaration.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
it
needed
to
make
an
evaluation
of
where
there
is
an
actual
risk
of
backsliding
and
where
there
is
actual
evidence
of
circumvention.
we
don't
believe
that.
we
don't--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that
evidence--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that
evidence
justifies
strict
enforcement
of
nondiscrimination
statutes,
but
it
does
not
justify
a
presumption
that
state
and
local
officials
in
these
areas
are
so
racist
that
they
cannot
be
relied
on
to
pass
and
enforce
fair
voting
laws.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
again,
this
(.)
this
information
that
goes
out
over
30
years
and
across
thousands
upon
thousands
of
jurisdictions--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--from
(.)
from
1982
forward.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
so
you
have
25
years
across
thousands
of
jurisdictions.
but
the
objection
rate
is
on
the
order
of
single
digits
per
10,000
submissions.
it
simply
as
a
matter
of
comparison
with
1965
doesn't
work.
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
again,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
this
congress,
of
the
united
states,
can
legislate
on
the
state-by-state
level.
after
all,
the
text
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
speaks
of
"any
state".
so
i
think
the
relevant
test
is
the
amount
of
discrimination
in
texas,
and
there
the
evidence
is
not
just
registration
rates;
it's
the
fact
that
they
lead
the
country
in
objections
under
section
5,
that
the
greatest
deterrent
effect
of
the
more
information
process
is
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
but,
as
justice
alito
pointed
out,
congress
didn't
know,
because
it
didn't
ask,
whether
discrimination
is
worse
in
tennessee
or
arkansas
than
in
virginia
and
other
states.
nobody
knows
sitting
here
today.
i
respectfully
disagree
that
congress
couldn't
have
put
together
that
effort.
what
we
really
do
hear
is
that
this,
this
badge
that
is
preclearance,
this
congressional
judgment
that
state
and
local
officials
in
covered
jurisdictions
who
in
my
experience
are
strongly--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--oh,
i
strongly
disagree
with
that.
aei
put
in
a
number
of
reports
that
evaluated
things
on
the
ground
in
a
variety
of
noncovered
jurisdictions
such
as
milwaukee.
i
certainly
think
within
the
time
that
congress
took
to
look
at
this
if
they
had
been
interested
they
could
have
easily
evaluated
this.
it
would
have
been
easily
available
to
them.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
no,
nobody
is
doing
that.
in
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
that's
what
congress
did
in
1982.
it
said
25
years.
that
25
years
has
gone
by.
times
have
changed.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
congress'
justification
simply
does
(.)
i
think
as
we've
heard
from
counsel,
in
light
of
our
mobile
society
and
the
fact
that
people
don't
live
in
the
same
place
people
lived
40
years
ago.
this
is
a
bad--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well
the
only
standards
that
exist
are
whether
they
use
a
test
or
devise
in
the
1960s.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
don't
think
we've
challenged
the
action
that
took
place--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--no,
justice
stevens,
we
do
challenge
that.
in
fact--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--because
this
court's
discussions
of
these
issues
in
morris
and
in
garrett
and
even
in
hibbs
indicate
that
it
does
matter
what
the
evidence
shows
with
respect
to
a
coverage
determination,
and
congress'
decision
to
not
update
it,
which
we
believe
was
for
political
reasons,
simply
bears
no
resemblance
to
reality.
and
looking
back
to
see
who
was
registered
and
who
was
voting
in
the
'60s
doesn't--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
our
argument.
i
think
our
argument
is
it's
partially
unconstitutional
because
it
even
failed
to
look
at
the
coverage
criteria
and
that
it
used
the
criteria
literally
off
the
books
from
the
'60s
and
'70s
without
even
looking
at
the
information.
again,
if
congress
had
done
that
in
1965
and
said,
we
want
to
look
at
this
franklin-hoover
(.)
excuse
me
(.)
this
franklin
roosevelt-hoover
election
in
1932,
i
think
the
court
would
have
been
pretty
surprised
that
that
was
the
best
and
most
relevant
information
that
congress
could
come
up
with.
this
idea
of
(.)
of
a
badge
that
really
runs
with
the
land
is
(.)
is
something
that
we
(.)
we
think
is
inherently
unjustifiable.
i'd
also
like
to
address
the
point
about
racial
bloc
voting.
racial
bloc
voting
is
not
discrimination,
and
it's
not
unconstitutional.
and,
indeed,
the
way
the
court
has
interpreted
section
2
(.)
and
i
realize
there
are
divisions
in
the
court
about
this--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
but
in
terms
of
this
facial
challenge,
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
understand
and
to
consider
the
fact
that
congress
really
thumbed
its
nose
at
the
court
in
terms
of
rejecting
the
constitutional
concerns
that
the
court
raised
in
(.)
in
miller
and
in
bossier
parish
and
in
georgia
versus
ashcroft.
the
new
enactment
has
been
changed
in
a
way
that
(.)
that
really
requires
covered
jurisdictions
to
engage
more
and
more
in
race-based
redistricting
and
race-based
(.)
and
it's
not
only
redistricting,
justice
ginsburg
(.)
in
race-based
decisionmaking.
and
so
here
we
are
40
years--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--we
believe
that
the
interpretation
of
the
act
or
(.)
excuse
me
(.)
the
passage
of
the
amendments
in
2006
go
far
beyond
what
preclearance
was
in
1965.
we
have
a
more
restrictive
form
of
preclearance
that
requires
state
and
local
governments
to
engage
in
more,
not
less,
race-based
decisionmaking
with
respect
to
elections.
and
that,
as
the
court
has
noted,
creates
additional
constitutional
issues
with
the
court
(.)
with
the
statute.
