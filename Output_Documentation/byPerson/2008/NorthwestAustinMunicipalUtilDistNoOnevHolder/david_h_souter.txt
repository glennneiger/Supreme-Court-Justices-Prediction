justice
david
h.
souter
exactly.
i
mean,
i
(.)
if
(.)
if
you're
basing
it
simply
on
your
subjection
to
preclearance
and
there's
no
contest
between
you
and
the
government
over
preclearing
anything,
i'm
not
sure
why
you
would
be
in
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
isn't
(.)
isn't
that
the
time
for
litigating?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
not
affecting
anything
you're
doing
on
a
day-to-day
basis,
as
i
understand
it.
there's
no
claim
that
(.)
that
your
district
is
doing
anything
improper.
no
claim
is
being
made
against
you.
and
i
guess
your
whole
argument
would
be
maybe
some
day
we
want
to
preclear
again,
and
maybe
we
wouldn't
be
as
successful
as
we
had
been
in
each
of
the
instances
before.
but
i
don't
see
how
that
gets
you
in
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
suit
(.)
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
and
i
may
be
wrong
on
this,
but
i
thought
this
suit
eventuated
from
the
fact
that
you
had
been
denied
bailout
and
that
your
entire
case
was
brought
on
the
refusal
of
bailout.
i
did
not
understand
that
you
had
brought
a
general
declaratory
judgment
action
or
a
(.)
or
a
facial
attack
in
gross,
as
it
were,
on
the
statute.
am
i
wrong
about
your
pleadings?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
separately
asked
for
declaratory
judgment?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
mr.
coleman,
this
is
important
to
me.
do
you
(.)
do
you
acknowledge
that
if
we
find
on
your
favor
on
the
bailout
point
we
need
not
reach
the
constitutional
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
coleman,
may
i
just
raise
a
basic
point
here.
and
i'll
be
candid
with
you
that
it
affects
my
view
of
your
argument.
i
just
want
to
start
with
it.
your
argument
is
largely
based
on
the
assumption
that
things
have
significantly
changed
and
that
therefore
congress
could
not
by
whatever
test
we
use
extend
the
(.)
extend
section
5.
but
what
we've
got
in
the
record
in
front
of
us
(.)
i
don't
have
a
laundry
list
to
read,
but
i
mean,
we've
got
i
think
at
the
present
time
a
6-point
(.)
a
16-point
registration
difference
on
hispanic
and
non-hispanic
white
voters
in
texas.
we've
got
a
record
of
some
600
interpositions
by
the
(.)
by
the
justice
department
on
section
5
proceedings,
section
5
objections,
over
a
period
of
about
20
years.
we
got
a
record
that
about
two-thirds
of
them
were
based
on
the
justice
department's
view
that
it
was
intentional
discrimination.
we've
got
something
like
600
section
2
lawsuits
over
the
same
period
of
time.
the
point
that
i'm
getting
at
is
i
don't
understand,
with
a
record
like
that,
how
you
can
maintain
as
a
basis
for
this
suit
that
things
have
radically
changed.
they
may
be
better.
but
to
say
that
they
have
radically
changed
to
the
point
that
this
becomes
an
unconstitutional
section
5
exercise
within
congress's
judgment
just
seems
to
me
to
(.)
to
deny
the
empirical
reality.
i
mean,
what
it
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
evidence
that
i've
been
getting
into
is
a
pretty
good
indication
(.)
i
would
have
thought
congress
thought
so
and
i
would
have
thought
so
too
(.)
that
there
is
something
to
be
concerned
about
on
the
issue
of
circumvention;
that
in
fact
the
attitudes
have
not
so
radically
changed
as
to
render
circumvention
irrelevant.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
evidence
that
justice
breyer
summarized,
that
i
alluded
to?
i
mean
those
(.)
that
is
simply
evidence
of
racial
attitude
and
it
seems
to
me
in
the
real
world
that
can
be
taken
as
evidence
that
if
the
(.)
if
the
section
5
safeguard
is
taken
away,
the
pushback
is
going
to
start.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
has
never
stopped.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
couldn't
(.)
they
couldn't
be
relied
upon
apparently
in
the
some
200
cases
in
which
the
voting
change
was
withdrawn
after
doj
objection.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
wasn't
information
over
30
years.
my
recollection
(.)
and
i
could
be
wrong
on
this,
but
my
recollection
is
that
those
were
statistics
from
about
20
years
prior
to
the
reauthorization.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
that's
correct.
