justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
question
just
as
sort
of
background.
does
your
case
challenge
at
all
the
standards
that
congress
has
used
throughout
the
statute
for
causing
states
to
become
covered
jurisdictions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
have
you
ever
challenged
those
as
a
basis
for
making
a
state
or
county
or
election
district
covered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
have
a
history
that
some
states
are
covered
and
some
are
not
because
of
certain
requirements
that
the
statute
imposed.
and
i
didn't
understand
the
case
to
involve
a
challenge
to
the
method
by
which
states
became
(.)
become
covered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
is
it
relevant
there
are
a
lot
of
states
out
there
that
are
not
covered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
arguing
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
congress
failed
to
extend
it
to
other
(.)
other
parts
of
the
country?
