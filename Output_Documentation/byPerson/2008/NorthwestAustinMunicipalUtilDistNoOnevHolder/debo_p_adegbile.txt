mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
long
experience
demonstrates
that
racial
discrimination
in
voting
has
been
persistent
and
adaptive.
only
after
careful
assessment
of
the
record
did
congress
find
that
the
case-by-case
method
was
inadequate
and
that
section
5
continued
to
do
important
work
within
the
covered
jurisdictions.
there
are
a
couple
of
things
that
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
in
light
of
the
discussion
that
we've
been
having.
first,
the
pernicious
nature
of
voting
discrimination
is
such
that
small
changes
in
the
rules
of
the
game
can
affect
many
people.
in
addition,
the
court
has
observed,
as
congress
has
on
multiple
occasions
when
reauthorizing
the
act,
that
the
case-by-case
method
is
slow
and
inadequate
to
the
task.
indeed,
justice
kennedy's
opinion
in
boerne
spoke
to
this
problem
of
the
case-by-case
method.
i
want
to--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--as
(.)
as
the
court
said
in
katzenbach
when
it
first
was
presented
with
this
question
of
the
coverage
formula,
congress
is
permitted
to
use
so
much
of
its
power
as
is
necessary
to
target
the
problem
as
it
finds
it.
the
discrimination
that
was
manifest
in
the
covered
jurisdictions
was
different
in
character
at
that
time
and
(.)
but
congress
did
not
stop
and
get
frozen
in
time
in
1965.
the
periodic
reauthorizations
have
given
congress
an
opportunity
to
revisit
the
progress.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
i
wouldn't
frame
it
in
that
way,
justice
(.)
chief
justice
roberts.
i
think
the
record
does
reveal
that
discrimination
in
the
covered
jurisdictions
has
a
repetitive
form.
there
are
very
(.)
there
are
brief
talks
about
over
six
dozen
examples.
those
are
illustrative
and
not
exhaustive,
but
repetitious
violations,
that
is,
violations
in
covered
jurisdictions
after
a
section
2
case--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
pattern
has
been
more
repetitious
violations
in
the
covered
jurisdictions
and
(.)
and
more
one
off
discrimination
in
other
places.
that
is
not
to
say
that
there
isn't
voting
discrimination
in
other
states.
the
record
shows
that
there
is
discrimination
in
other
states.
but
the
(.)
but
congress
found
that
the
nature
of
the
way
the
discrimination
is
practiced,
viewed
through
the
lens
of
history,
is
that
repetitive
violations
happen.
for
example,
after
this
court
decided
the
lulac
case,
a
case
that
was
litigated
over
a
number
of
months
and
very
expensive
and
complicated,
the
state
then
tried
to
shorten
the
period
for
early
voting.
and
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
needed
to
file
a
section
5
enforcement
action,
post-2000
redistricting,
to
give
effect
to
this
court's
judgment.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
i
think
in
the
context
of
that
circumstance,
justice
(.)
chief
justice
roberts,
the
issue
was
that
you
had
a
long-standing
incumbent
and
that
the
early
voting
(.)
the
timing
of
the
early
voting
period
was
such
that
it
was
going
to
conflict
with
a
(.)
a
holiday
of
(.)
of
a--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--to
protect
the
incumbent,
but
to
disadvantage
the
community
that
was
prepared
to
exercise
its
voice,
as
this
court
found
in
the
lulac
opinion.
that
is
to
say--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--the
incumbent
was
not
the
candidate
of
choice.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
by
all
means,
but
the
(.)
but
the
incumbent
protection
in
this
instance
was
designed
to
cut
off
the
minority
community,
the
latino
voters
who
had
been
disadvantaged
by
virtue
of
that
plan.
but
certainly
that
is
not
the
only
example.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
it
was
(.)
it
was
33
to
390,
i
believe.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
well--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--justice
scalia,
i
think
some
members
of
congress
did
of
course
vote
against
the
act.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
thirty-three
members
of
the
house,
indeed.
but
i
think
the
(.)
the
reason
that
they
voted
for
it
is
what's
more
important.
congress
did
not
assume
that
section
5
was
necessary.
it
took
a
very
careful
examination
to
see
how
it
was
operating,
and
the
determination
was
that
in
the
absence
of
section
5,
because
of
the
repetitive
violations,
because
of
620
objections
(.)
there
was
evidence
that
approximately
60
percent
of
those
show
some
evidence
of
intentional
discrimination.
if
you
take
away
the
prophylaxis,
the
discrimination
will
return
in
a
way
that
we
don't
need
to
revisit.
the
history
has
been
that
voting
discrimination
manifests
itself
through
repetitive
efforts
and--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--congress
had
a
more
specific
reason
as
i
understand
the
record.
there
was
a
specific
amendment
proposed
to
shorten
the
time
to
10
years.
then
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee
james
sensenbrenner
rose
to
it
explain
part
of
the
experience
most
of
the
infractions
not
all
but
most
when
many
voting
changes
are
necessary
through
reapportionment.
not
all
of
them
involved
reapportionment
but
many
of
them
are
necessitated
and
the
judgment
was
that
it
was
going
to
capture
two
censuses
and
they
also
looked
back
to
see
how
much
discrimination
they
found
from
1982
to
reauthorization.
and
indeed
congress
has
been
a
little
bit
surprised
they
have
not
been
able
to
dislodge
more
of
the
discrimination.
they
acknowledged
the
progress
but
saw
that
section
5
was
part
of
the
agent
of
change.
progress
didn't
happen
by
itself
and
the
experience
had
been
that
it
was
helping
us
to
move
forward
and
that
is
reflected
i
think
in
the
state's
brief
to
come
to
justice
kennedy's
point.
i
think
there
is
an
intrusion.
this
court's
decisions
have
recognized
that
section
5
does
intrude
but
even
in
bernie
as
the
court
distinguished
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
from
the,
many
of
the
statutes
that
were
there
at
issue
in
this
case,
rfra,
certainly
other
cases
followed,
the
court
kept
returning
to
section
5
because
the
problem
had
been
demonstrated
by
congress.
the
gravity
of
the
harm
was
so
severe
that
congress
needed
a
special
mechanism
to
dislodge
it
because
if
we
don't
have
the
vote
as
this
court's
decisions
have
recognized,
our
whole
system
is
undermined.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
is
that
it
wanted
to
stay
the
course
of
ridding
the
covered
jurisdictions
from
discrimination.
katzenbach
spoke
in
items
of
the
case.
subsequent
have
spoke
about
ridding
the
country
of
this
scourge
as
it
manifested
itself
in
the
covered
jurisdictions
and
i
think
this
was
some
state-by-state
analysis
and
the
reports
of
the
covered
jurisdictions
that
do
it--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--i
can't
precisely
quantify
the
quantum
of
discrimination
in
each
of
those
stays
but
i
think
that
congress'
judgment
was
there
had
been
a
demonstrated
pattern
of
discrimination
in
the
covered
jurisdictions,
covering
formula
had--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--yes,
indeed
it
was.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
yes,
justice
scalia,
i
take
the
point.
but
i
think
it's
not
quite
fair
to
say.
as
my
predecessor
at
the
podium
made
the
point,
that
there
have
been
african-americans
to
rise
to
high
office
throughout
our
history,
but
that
occasion
of
a
single
person
sitting
in
a
seat
doesn't
change
the
experience
on
the
ground
for
everyday
citizens.
it
is
(.)
it
has
an
important
salutory
effect
and
it
tells
us
about
the
possibilities
of
our
constitution,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
voters
that
are
trying
to
vote
in
a
school
board
election
in
louisiana
are
going
to
have
an
easy
time
of
it
where
racially
polarized
voting
is
as
extreme
as
it
is
and
when
election
officials
manipulate
the
rules
of
the
game
to
try
and
disadvantage
the
minority
community.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
i
think
the
close
(.)
the
best
evidence
of
the
comparison
question
to
which
you're
returning
is
the
section
2
cases
that
were
examined
in
a
report
that
was
submitted
to
congress.
and
as
appellants
recognize
in
their
brief,
600
(.)
notwithstanding
the
powerful
section
5
remedy,
there
were
653
successful
section
2
cases
in
covered
jurisdictions,
and
the
success
rate
in
covered
jurisdictions
was
much
higher
than
in
noncovered
jurisdictions.
so
when
you
put
together
the
objections,
the
requests
for
more
information
followed
by
withdrawals,
the
section
5
enforcement
actions,
the
section
2
cases,
it
is
a
picture
that
far
exceeds
the
record
that
was
before
this
august
body
when
considering
enactments
of
congress
in
other
contexts
in
hibbs
and
in
lane,
and
the
record
was
of
intentional
discrimination,
not
simply
disparities
but
purposeful
efforts
to
disadvantaged
minority
groups.
and
i
think
that's
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
covered
jurisdictions
and
the
noncovered.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
i
think
there
are
two
responses.
first,
the
relevant
assessment
is
not
simply
the
rate.
as
the
lower
court
found,
the
rate
of
objections
even
at
the
time
of
the
1975
re-authorization
in
rome
was
very
small.
judge
tatel
spoke
to
this
point
in
his
opinion
and
in
the
oral
argument.
the
rate
has
always
been
small.
but
what
section
5
is
designed
to
do
is
to
vindicate
the
principles
of
our
constitution,
and
the
gravity
of
the
harm
is
such
that
if
we
have
620
examples
of
discrimination
and
60
percent
of
those
are
intentional
discrimination
together
with
some
of
the
other
indicia
and
under
this
court's
cases
congress
is
entitled
to
look
broadly,
not
simply
at
the
decided
case,
but
to
look
broadly
and
to
be
the
factfinder
of
this
important
information.
this
is
a
pattern.
it's
a
widespread
pattern
of
intentional
discrimination,
and
i
think
that
that
is
something
that
this
court
needs
to
focus
on
as
it
works
through
this
important
and
serious
issue.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
approximately
10
months,
justice
breyer.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
i
think
that
i
can't
put
a
precise
time
on
it,
but
it
would
have
been
certainly
a
couple
more
years.
the
time
that
is
necessary
to
compile
these
investigations
and
the
expertise
that's
necessary
to
assemble
them
and
cull
the
data
takes
some
time
in
my
personal
experience.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
i
make
a
slightly
different
point.
i
don't
think
that
it
doesn't
matter
at
all.
i
think
congress
has
to
act
reasonably,
but
in
light
of
the
record
before
it
its
judgment
to
stay
the
course
in
the
covered
jurisdictions
because
of
the
way
voting
discrimination
has
manifested
itself
in
those
jurisdictions,
that
judgment
is
reasonable
on
the
record
it
had
before
it.
it
made
a
judgment
in
effect
that
section
2
has
proven
more
adequate
to
the
task
in
other
jurisdictions
that
don't
have
the
same
history
of
repetitive
violations.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
i
think
that
if
things
were
flipped
and
discrimination
was
much
worse
outside,
that
would
reflect
on
the
reasonableness
of
congress'
judgment.
but
that's
a
fact
situation
that
was
not
present
before
congress.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
thank
you.
