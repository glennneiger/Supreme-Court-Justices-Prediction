justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
if
your
district
were
located
in
a
separately
covered
political
subdivision,
you
clearly
could
not
bail
out.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
section
2
is
ineffective,
then
why
didn't
congress
extend
section
5
to
the
entire
country?
could
congress
have
reauthorized
section
5
without
identifying
significant
differences
between
the
few
jurisdictions
that
are
covered
and
the
rest
of
the
country?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
it's
18
percent.
if
these
statistics
are
correct,
the
difference
between
latino
registration
and
white
registration
in
texas
was
18.6
percent,
which
is
not
good,
but
it's
substantially
lower
than
the
rate
in
california,
which
is
not
covered,
37
percent;
colorado,
28
percent;
new
mexico,
24
percent;
the
nationwide
average,
30
percent.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
wouldn't
you
agree
that
there
is
some
oddities
in
this
coverage
formula?
isn't
(.)
is
it
not
the
case
that
in
new
york
city
the
bronx
is
covered
and
brooklyn
and
queens
are
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
this
question
about
(.)
about
bailout?
i
mean
we
have
(.)
there's
a
very
odd
aspect
to
this
case.
we
have
an
immense
constitutional
question
and
then
on
the
other
hand
you
have
this
little
utility
district,
which
(.)
and
you'll
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
as
far
as
i
got
from
the
briefs,
they
have
never
done
anything
wrong,
and
they
would
like
to
bail
out
and
the
voting
rights
act
was
intended
to
permit
jurisdictions
that
were
not
committing
transgressions
to
bail
out.
now
if
the
statute
doesn't
allow
them
to
do
it,
the
statute
doesn't
allow
them
to
do
it,
but
is
there
any
good
reason
why
a
district
like
that
should
not
be
permitted
to
bail
out?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
it's
the
case
that
there
is
no
discrimination
going
on,
no
evasion
going
on
in
this
little
utility
district,
is
there
any
good
reason
why
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
bail
out?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
you
say
from
your
experience
and
i'm
sure
you're
very
knowledgeable
about
this
that
there
is
no
great
are
discrimination
in
voting
in
virginia
than
in
north
carolina
or
in
tennessee
or
in
arkansas
or
in
ohio?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
they
now
have
25
years
to
look
at,
or
24
years,
to
look
at
the
rest
of
the
country.
are
they
doing
that?
are
they
holding
hearings?
