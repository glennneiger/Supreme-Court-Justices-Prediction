g.

no,
i'll
ask
you
that
question
because
i'd
like
to
hear
your
answer
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
this
question
for
a
second,
please?
and
just
take
2
minutes
to
answer
it
or
not.
you
don't
have
to
answer
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
this
is
the
question.
this
whole
issue
depends
on
the
evidence
before
congress.
so,
in
reading
the
briefs,
i
have
six
categories
of
evidence.
compared
to
the
city
of
rome,
the
registration
turnout
still
has
two
states,
virginia
and
texas,
with
significant
disparities.
as
to
minority
officeholders,
there
is
a
big
improvement,
but
if
you
look
at
mississippi,
louisiana,
and
south
carolina
and
a
couple
of
others,
it
is
still
not
great.
the
doj
objections:
the
number
of
doj
objections
has
fallen
a
lot,
but
it
still
exists.
in
terms
of
election
observers,
which
were
not
mentioned
in
city
of
rome,
we
have
their
statistics
that
two-thirds
of
the
observers
are
focused
on
five
of
the
six
states
that
are
covered.
in
terms
of
polarized
voting,
not
mentioned
in
rome,
we
still
have
testimony
that
the
polarization
is
significant
and
common
in
certain
places.
and
as
to
successful
section
2,
section
5
suits,
once
again
not
mentioned
in
the
city
of
rome,
but
since
1982
there
were
at
least
105
successful
section
5
suits
and
653
successful
section
2
suits.
all
right.
i
just
summarized
that
because
i'd
like
to
hear
in
a
couple
of
minutes,
or
five,
or
whatever
you
want
to
take.
i'm
trying
to
lead
you
to
what
i
think
is
the
heart
of
the
case.
it
seems
evidentiary.
that
is
what
i
read.
what
is
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whatever
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
the
reason
in
your
opinion
if
you
had
to
summarize
it
in
ray
sentence
or
two,
you
would
say
that
the
reason
that
congress
didn't
go
into
other
states
and
decide
which
ones
to
add
to
this
or
go
into
these
states
district
by
district
and
decide
which
ones
to
subtract
from
this,
the
reason
that
congress
didn't
modify
voting
rights
statute
but
simply
renewed
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
i
have
another
question.
how
long
did
it
take
congress
to
compile
this
13,000-page
record?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
long
would
it
have
taken
congress
in
your
opinion
to
have
compiled
the
record
to
figure
out
what's
happening
in
this
respect
in
every
state
or
in
these
states
district
by
district?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
should
have
a
chance
to
answer
the
same
question.
you
heard
my
question,
the
time
question.
what's
your
estimate?
