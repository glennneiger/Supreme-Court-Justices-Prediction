justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
to
the
extent
we
have
some
latitude
in
construing
the
act,
certainly
it
would
be
a
relevant
factor
if
we
concluded
that
it's
just
unworkable
or
impractical
to
have
an
uncovered
jurisdiction
within
a
county
which
is
a
covered
jurisdiction.
they
would
have
competing
election
days,
competing
election
formulae.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
just
makes
compliance
with
the
act
much
more
difficult.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
find
that
you're
not
covered
by
the
bailout
provision,
that
only
the
county
is,
do
you
really
then
have
standing
to
proceed
to
question
the
workability
of
the
bailout
procedures?
i
(.)
i
suppose
that
would
be
a
threshold
argument
for
you
to
question
the
validity
of
the
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
justice
breyer
(.)
justice
breyer
did
refer
you
to
some
other
more
current
statistics,
submissions,
title
v
suits,
and
so
forth.
you
might
want
to
address
those.
and
in
that
context,
was
there
any
control
data
to
compare
preclearance
rates
or
preclearance
events
in
colored
(.)
in
covered
jurisdictions
as
opposed
to
uncovered
jurisdictions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
(.)
that's
part
of
the
showing,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
congress
has
to
make,
that
these
states
that
are
now
covered
and
that
were
covered
are
markedly
different
from
the
noncovered
jurisdictions.
was
there
anything
in
the
record
before
the
congress
or
the
district
court
to
address
that
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
the
burden
that
the
act
puts
on
the
state
irrelevant
consideration?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
many
people
in
the
department
of
justice
(.)
what's
the
department
of
justice
budget
for
preclearance
processes
each
year,
do
you
know?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thirty
attorneys.
do
you
quarrel
with
the
assessment
(.)
the
testimony
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
that
it
costs
the
states
and
the
municipalities
a
billion
dollars
over
10
years
to
comply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
think
that
is
(.)
that
is
relevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
yet
(.)
yet
the
congress
has
made
a
finding
that
the
sovereignty
of
georgia
is
less
than
the
sovereign
dignity
of
ohio.
the
sovereignty
of
alabama,
is
less
than
the
sovereign
dignity
of
michigan.
and
the
governments
in
one
are
to
be
trusted
less
than
the
governments
than
the
other.
and
does
the
united
states
take
that
position
today?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
my
point
stands.
you
say
that
there
is
a
basis
for
treating
states
quite
differently
as
to
the
(.)
this
fundamental
right
that
we
all
agree
on
with
respect
to
voting.
and
what's
happened
in
part
is
that
because
of
section
5
preclearance,
say,
a
minority
opportunity
district
is
protected
in
covered
jurisdictions
and
not
in
noncovered
jurisdictions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
(.)
this
is
a
great
disparity
in
treatment,
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
saying
that
our
states
must
be
treated
differently.
and
you
have
a
very
substantial
burden
if
you're
going
to
make
that
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
one
(.)
no
one
questions
the
validity,
the
urgency,
the
essentiality
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it
should
be
continued
with
this
differentiation
between
the
states.
and
that
is
for
congress
to
show.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
overall
historical
record,
katzenbach
said
there
had
been
unremitting
and
ingenious
defiance,
and
that
was
certainly
true
as
of
the
time
of
the
voting
rights
act.
democracy
was
a
shambles
in
those
(.)
that's
not
true
anymore,
and
to
say
that
the
states
are
willing
to
yield
their
sovereign
authority
and
their
sovereign
responsibilities
to
govern
themselves
doesn't
work.
we've
said
in
clinton
v.
new
york
that
congress
can't
surrender
its
powers
to
the
president,
and
the
same
is
true
with
reference
to
the
states.
wouldn't
you
agree?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
covered
states
as
opposed
to
noncovered
states,
if
i
can
add
that
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
please.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
one
thing
on
bailout.
it's
like
eurystheus
keeps
telling
hercules,
"oh,
you
did
a
good
job,
but
now
you've
got
another
(.)
got
another
thing
to
do.
"
that's
the
bailout
provision.
anybody
who
has
tried
to
fill
out
a
government
form
realizes
they
make
a
mistake,
so
that
the
doj
rejects
it,
that
counts
as
a
rejection.
you
have
to
have
a
(.)
what,
a
clean
record
for
how
many
(.)
how
many
years
(.)
before
you
can
preclear?
i
mean,
this
is
simply
impracticable.
and
it
seems
to
me
a
cornerstone
of
the
act
and
of
your
argument
for
upholding
the
act,
and
if
we
find
that
it
doesn't
work,
that
it's
just
(.)
it's
just
an
illusion,
that
gives
me
serious
pause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
that's
absolutely
right.
section
2
cases
are
very
expensive.
they
are
very
long.
they
are
very
inefficient.
i
think
this
section
5
preclearance
device
has
(.)
has
shown
(.)
has
been
shown
to
be
very
very
successful.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it
can
be
justified
when
other
states
are
not
covered
today.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
brief
filed
by
the
naacp
legal
defense
fund,
the
first
15
pages
i
think
makes
a
good
demonstration
of
discrete
discriminatory
acts;
and
the
brief
filed
by
nathaniel,
professor
percelly,
makes
an
important
point
about
crossovers
in
different
(.)
my
concern
is
it's
just
not
clear
to
me
that
congress
addressed
this
for
the
rest
of
the
country.
that's
my
concern.
