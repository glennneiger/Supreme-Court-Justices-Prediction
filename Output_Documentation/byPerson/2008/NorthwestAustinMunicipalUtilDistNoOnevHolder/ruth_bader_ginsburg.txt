bailout
wasn't
involved
in
those
cases.
and
what
do
you
do
with
a
statute
that
has
three
categories
(.)
the
state,
political
subdivision,
and
then
there's
"governmental
unit"?
the
district
qualifies
as
a
governmental
unit.
why
would
congress
add
that
third
category
if
the
district
came
within
"political
subdivision"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
(.)
but
the
statute
does
use
the
term
"governmental
unit"
to
encompass
districts.
and
if
they
were
also
subdivisions,
why
would
congress
need
to
add
an
additional
category?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
appears
in
the
statute
twice,
suggesting
that
congress
had
in
mind
three
categories.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
(.)
the
district
court
had
some
assistance
from
the
legislative
development
of
this
latest
extension.
there
was
a
proposal,
was
there
not,
to
allow
governmental
units
to
bail
out
(.)
to
allow
anyone
who
was
required
to
preclear
to
bail
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
was
the
reason
that
it
was
resisted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
department
of
justice
has
(.)
does
it
(.)
does
it
not
have
a
regulation
that
contradicts
your
reading?
and
hasn't
that
been
out
there
(.)
wasn't
it
out
there
before
the
2006
extension?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
last
time
the
district
applied
for
preclearance,
the
last
year?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
2004
is
the
last
year.
so
between
2004
and
2009
the
district
has
not
sought
preclearance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
don't
challenge
(.)
if
you
have
bailout,
say
we
accept
your
reading
of
the
statute,
you
are
not
contesting
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
if
it
matched
your
obligation
to
preclear
with
the
right
to
bail
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
(.)
i
thought
i
just
heard
you
say
even
if
you
got
the
bailout
the
extension
for
another
25
years
would
still
be
unconstitutional.
is
that
(.)
or
are
you
saying
that
the
accommodation,
the
modification,
would
suffice
to
make
the
statute
constitutional?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
(.)
but
there
was
(.)
congress
fastened
on
that
issue
and
it
referred
to
second
generation
discrimination,
which
is
a
frequent
pattern
with
discrimination.
you
start
with
the
blatant
overt
discrimination,
and
then
in
time
people
recognize
that
that's
(.)
that
won't
go
any
more,
so
the
discrimination
becomes
more
subtle,
less
easy
to
smoke
out.
but
it
doesn't
go
from
blatant
overt
discrimination
to
everything
is
equal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
take
the
multiple
devices
(.)
take
the
one
as
simple
as
moving
the
election
day
so
that
it
will
coincide
with
the
(.)
with
the
holiday
of
a
predominantly
minority
college.
to
go
after
every
change
of
that
order
with
a
section
2
lawsuit
(.)
of
the
two
devices,
surely
section
5
is
more
effective
to
smoke
that
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
perhaps
they
(.)
perhaps
they
wouldn't
if
the
only
tool
in
the
arsenal
were
section
2,
if
everything
had
to
be
a
federal
lawsuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
kind
of
coverage
formula
would
be
adequate?
you
are
attacking
congress'
preservation
of
the
same
coverage
formula.
but
what
other
coverage
formula
could
it
come
up
with?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
(.)
and
maybe
the
government
will
refer
to
it
(.)
i
thought,
quite
a
bit
of
evidence
comparing
covered
and
noncovered
in
this
record.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
said
all
that
there
was
was
a
number
of
section
2
suits,
but
i
think
there
was
quite
a
bit
more
than
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
your
(.)
in
your
answer
you
said
if
they
used
the
2004
the
only
state
would
be
hawaii.
but
i
asked
you
what
formula
would
pass
if
congress
wants
to
get
at
(.)
wants
to
protect
the
gains
that
have
been
made
but
are
still
fragile
against
backsliding?
if
that's
its
objective,
what
can
it
cover?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
have
(.)
we
have
before
us
the
representations
of
the
county
in
which
the
district
is
located,
and
of
several
of
the
covered
jurisdictions,
that
they
don't
seek
bailout
because
they
think
that
the
benefits,
many
of
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
districting,
outweigh
whatever
burden
preclearance
puts
on
them.
it's
first,
bringing
minority
groups
into
the
discussion
of
what
the
change
will
be
in
the
first
place,
and
then
warding
off
the
kind
of
examples
that
appear
in
the
(.)
in
the
louis
(.)
i
think
we
(.)
we
can't
impugn
their
integrity
by
saying
that
that
host
of
reasons,
having
nothing
to
do
with
redistricting,
is
why
they
are
not
asking
for
bailout.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
number
is
18
now?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
question
is,
do
you
agree
that
this
is
unlike
access
to
buildings
by
people
who
are
in
wheelchairs?
there
has
to
come
a
point
where
it
will
end,
and
perhaps
congress
was
just
picking
up
on
what
this
court
said
a
few
years
before
in
the
university
of
michigan
law
school
case,
this
court
came
up
with
a
25-year
figure
so
maybe
congress
thought
this
court
thinks
25
years
is
about
right,
must
be
about
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
this
court
said
(.)
it
was
not
1982,
it
was
two
thousand
something.
this
court
thought
from
two
thousand
something
25
years
was
a
reasonable
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
district
will
(.)
the
district
will
never
be
involved
in
racial
bloc
voting
for
districting
purposes
because
it
doesn't
(.)
it's
boundaries
don't
change.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
wouldn't
one
construing
the
act
as
it
was
passed
in
2006,
say,
well,
congress
obviously
had
in
mind
that
this
would
be
enforced
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
shaw,
this
court's
decision
in
miller?
