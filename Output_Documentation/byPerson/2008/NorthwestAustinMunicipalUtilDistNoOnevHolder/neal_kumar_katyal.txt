mr.
neal
k.
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
and
let
me
begin
where
mr.
coleman
left
off,
because
i
don't
think
that
his
argument
adequately
grapples
either
with
this
court's
consistent
upholding
of
the
provision
at
issue
4
times
over
4
decades
or
with
congress's
action
in
2006.
congress's
reauthorization
in
2006
was
the
paradigmatic
attempt
of
what
to
do
in
congress.
it
didn't
redefine
a
rate,
nor
did
it
cast
aspersions
at
supreme
court
doctrine.
rather,
it
took
that
doctrine
seriously,
both
this
court's
teachings
with
respect
to
the
voting
rights
act
specifically,
as
well
as
the
(.)
as
the
scope
of
the
congress's
reconstruction
enforcement
powers,
and
arrived
at
a
considered
judgment.
after
16,000
pages
of
testimony,
21
different
hearings
over
10
months,
congress
looked
at
the
evidence
and
determined
that
their
work
was
not
done.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
i
(.)
i
disagree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
what
that
represents
is
that
section
5
is
actually
working
very
well;
that
it
provides
a
deterrent.
this
was
a
debate
in
congress.
indeed,
mr.
coleman
himself
testified
before
congress
and
said
the
low
objection
rate
is
evidence
that
it
isn't
congruent
to
proportional.
the
congress
disagreed
with
that.
what
it
found
instead
was
that
section
5
was
deterring
the
problem.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
well,
let
me
suggest
another
example.
yesterday
the
administrative
office
for
the
united
states
courts
said
there
were
approximately
17,500
requests
for
title
3
wiretaps
in
the
past
10
years.
four
of
them
had
been
rejected.
that's
a.023
percent
rejection
rate.
but
i
don't
think
one
could
use
those
numbers
and
say,
oh,
that
means
that
title
3
doesn't
deter
or
prevent
abusive
wiretaps.
what
it
suggests
instead,
if
congress
would
have
found
(.)
i
agree
that
if
we
were
just
standing
up
with
no
record
whatsoever,
that's
one
thing,
but
if
congress
heard
testimony,
they
found
example
after
example
of--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--absolutely.
and
congress
found
with
respect
to
those
intentional
(.)
laws
that
prevent
intentional
vote
discrimination,
which
is
section
2,
which
you
hear
mr.
coleman
relying
on
today,
that
that
is
ineffective
for
the
same
reasons
that
this
court
has
found
them
repeatedly
in
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach,
in
city
of
rome.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
quite
a
bit
of
evidence
about
the
ineffectiveness
of
section
2
as
a
remedy.
so
(.)
and
the
statement
for
the
intervenors
(.)
there's
a
500-page
statement
filed
before
the
district
court
which
excerpts
the
congressional
record.
in
the
pages
270
to
279
you
see
a
long
series
of
(.)
a
long
analysis
by
congress
about
how
section
2
is
ineffective,
that
it
costs
too
much
to
bring
the
litigation,
that
there
are
few
attorneys
that
will
handle
it,
that
(.)
that
there
isn't
enough
money
and
that--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
congress
had
to
make
some
showing.
and
here
there
are
explicit
legislative
findings
that
say
that
section
5
is
needed
in
these
areas--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--well,
i
disagree
with
that
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
and
most
i
think
what
this
utility
district
can
argue
about
is
texas,
and
congress
found
very
specific
evidence
about
discrimination
in
the
state
of
texas.
they
found
that
they
led
the
country
in
the
number
of
objections.
they
found
that
the
(.)
that
the
registration
rates,
as
justice
souter
said,
between
hispanics
and
whites
was
great.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
well,
again,
i
think
that
what
congress
found
is
that
the
rate
in
texas
coupled
with
its
historical
amount
of
discrimination
together
justified
(.)
justified
the
reauthorization
of
section
5.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
again,
i
think
what
this
court
has
(.)
has
answered
that
question
in
katzenbach
by
saying
it
may
be
the
case
that
there
are
other
jurisdictions
discriminate
more,
congress
can
deal
with
the
problem
one
step
at
a
time.
and
the
(.)
and
congress
has
said
that
the
court
should
be
particularly
worried
about
trying
to
predict
the
future
and
say
that
discrimination
is
now
over.
we
have
fairly
good--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--absolutely
not.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
well,
congress
here
said
25
years
was
(.)
25
years
was
the
appropriate
reauthorization
period.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
well,
again,
if
congress
can't
make
the
findings,
then
i
think
this
court
would
be
well
within
its
powers
to
(.)
to
strike
it
down.
but
here
the
court
is
being
asked
to
do
something
that
has
never
been
done
before,
which
is
to
use
its
fifteenth
(.)
to
say
that
congress
exceeded
the
balance
of
its
fifteenth
amendment
powers
and
its
fourteenth
amendment
powers
in
an
area
involving
race
and
voting.
that
has
never
happened
before.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
it
certainly
is.
we
don't--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--i
don't
know
what
the
budget
is.
i
can
tell
you
there
are
(.)
there
are
approximately
30
attorneys
who
work
in
the
voting--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--again,
i
don't
quarrel
with
that,
but
congress
certainly--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--i
(.)
i
certainly
think
the
burden
on
the
states
is
relevant.
also
relevant
is
the
fact
that
the
states
are
now
not
coming
before
the
court
and
objecting
the
way
they
were
in
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
i
wouldn't
put
it
at
all
in
those
terms.
i
would
say
what
congress
found
is
that
there
is
a
historical
amount
of
discrimination
coupled
with
recent
evidence
and
comparative
data
between
covered
and
noncovered
jurisdictions
that
justifies
continuation
of
a
remedy
that
states
now
overwhelmingly
appreciate.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
but
(.)
but--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--justice
kennedy,
their
burden
is
the
same
as
it
has
always
been
in
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach
and
city
of
rome.
the
burden
is
on
congress
to
say
is
continuation
of
this
landmark
achievement,
one
of
the
most
transformative
acts
in
american
history,
still
justified,
because
with
this
act
what
congress
(.)
what
congress
did
was
essentially
redeem
itself
in
the
eyes
of
the
world.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
and
congress
did
show
precisely
that.
they
showed,
for
example,
justice
kennedy,
that
(.)
that
the
differential
between
covered
and
noncovered
states
with
respect
to
section
2
lawsuits
was
57
percent
of
successful
section
2
lawsuits
were
filed
in
covered
jurisdictions,
even
though
they
are
25
percent
of
the
population--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--because
that
(.)
because,
again,
that
is
only
one
aspect
of
the
overall
problem,
the
amount
of
registration
rates
or
something
like
that.
what
congress
has
historically
done
ever
since
the
inception
of
the
voting
rights
act
is
target
those
states
where
discrimination
is
so
rooted
that
it
is
hard
to
get
rid
of
without
preclearance.
preclearance
will
transform
the
landscape
and
enfranchise
millions
of
americans.
and
congress
heard
evidence
and
said,
after
16,000
pages
of
testimony,
that
the
extension
in
these
specific
areas
was
necessary
in
order
to
root
out
and
prevent
discriminatory
changes.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
there
(.)
there
(.)
there
are
certainly
some
oddities,
as
there
always
have
been,
from
katzenbach
and
from
city
of
rome.
and
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
congress
can
act
on
the
state-by-state
level
and
(.)
and
that
there
is
a
remedy
for
the
problem,
which
is
the
bailout
provision--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--that's
correct.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
there
(.)
there
have
been
18
under
the
new
provision,
which
is--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--i
am
saying--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--again--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--justice
scalia,
that
precise
argument
was
made
to
congress
in
2006
and
it
was
rejected.
and
it--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--and
i
think
it's
not
right
because
what
the
testimony
found
was
that
states
are
able
to
bail
out,
but
they
don't,
and
this
goes
back
to
my
point
to
justice
kennedy,
because
today
states
are
finding
that
preclearance
actually
serves
their
interests;
it
increases--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--well,
i
don't
think
that's
a
quite
fair
characterization.
after
all,
here,
congress
in
2006
(.)
all
senators
voted
for
this
bill,
and
indeed
90
of
the
110
representatives
from
covered
jurisdictions
voted
for
it,
so
if
the
court
is
concerned
about--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--excuse
me?
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
well,
i
think
that
we
shouldn't
(.)
this
court
should
be
loathe
to
second-guess
the
motivations
of
congress
under--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--that's
precisely
right,
justice
ginsburg,
and
what
the
covered
jurisdictions
also
say
is
something
about
how
this
(.)
the
test
before
this
court
shouldn't
be
the
narrowest
time
slice
of
today,
but
rather
the
test
should
be
to
think
about
historically
what
has
happened.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
but--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--yes,
and--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--and
this
court
has
recognized
and
the
brief
of
the
covered
jurisdictions
recognizes
the
fact
that
it's
a
separate
sovereign
requiring
in
this
provides
an
additional
deterrent
element
and
increases
the
integrity
of
the
elections.
if
i
could
return
to
the
point
i
was
saying
a
moment
ago,
what
these
covered
jurisdictions
are
saying
is
that
this
moment
in
time
isn't
the
right
test.
rather
you
should
look
at
the
overall
historical
record--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--that
is
correct.
and
here
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
this
isn't
any
sort
of
surrendering
of
power.
it
was
justified
because
of
the
record
of
discrimination.
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
quite
think
said
that
defiance
was
the
precondition;
rather
it
found
that
the
onerous
amount
of
case-by-case
litigation
itself
wasn't
enough.
and
i
would
caution
this
court
because
this
court
has
had
examples
before
in
which
the
historical
record
looked
good
at
a
narrow
moment
in
time.
if
we
think
back
100
years
to
reconstruction,
95
percent
of
african-americans
in
franchise,
600
black
members
in
the
state
legislatures,
8
black
members
of
congress,
8
black
justice
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
things
looked
good,
and
that
led
this
court
in
the
civil
rights
cases
over
justice
harlan's
lone
dissent
to
say
the
era
of
special
protection
was
over.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
yes,
absolutely,
because
that's
what
city
of
rome
argued
in
1980,
and
what
this
court
said
in
rejecting
precisely
that
argument
over
justice
powell's
dissent,
was
that
it's
not
that
discrimination
can't
be
to
be
at
the
individual
unit-by-unit
level.
it
rather,
if
congress
so
chooses,
can
do
it
on
a
more
broad
level.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
first
of
all
there
was
a
bailout
provision
at
issue
in
1980.
it
was
amended
in
1982.
and
yes,
i
think
congress
contemplated
a
process
(.)
the
legislative
record
on
this
is
very
clear.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--that
(.)
no,
what
they
contemplated
was
to
make
it
easier
for
political
divisions
to
bail
out,
and
what
congress
(.)
what
congress
anticipated,
certainly
more
than
one
a
year,
that
didn't
materialize.
and
again,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
the
reason
why
it
didn't
materialize
is
because
states
generally
(.)
general
appreciate
section
5's
preclearance
process
as
well
as
its
(.)
covered
jurisdictions.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
i
do.
i
think
that
congress,
congress'
reports,
it's
16,000-page
track
record--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--i
do
agree
that
they
went
state
by
state
and
showed
(.)
showed
tremendous
amounts
of
discrimination
in
those
places.
of
course
i
disagree
with
the
notion
that
this
utility
district
can
point
to
any
one
place
in
the
country,
be
it
massachusetts
or
some
corner
in
georgia,
and
say
well,
the
evidence
wasn't
there.
i
think
congress
has
far
more
latitude
under
its
fifteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment
powers.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
justice
kennedy,
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
the
bailout
provision
works
nothing
like
the
way
that
it
might
be
hypothesized.
that
is,
every
single
county,
every
single
political
subdivision
that
has
asked
for
a
bailout
has
received
one,
and
in
2006
there
was
an
even
amendment
offered
to
minimize
the
bailout
provision.
that
amendment
was
rejected
overwhelmingly,
and
the
reason
it
was
rejected
was
that
jurisdictions
that
are
covered
have
now
come
to
appreciate
the
power
of
section
5
to
deter
voting
discrimination,
and
that's
why
congress
made
a
judgment--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--for
the
way
the
statute
works,
they
have
to
go
to
the
107
subunits,
which
is
absolutely
feasible
because
they
are
under
contract
with
all
107
subunits
to
administer
their
elections.
they
have
all
of
the
voting
data
to
put
together
that
bailout,
and
in
previous--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--again,
i
think
that's
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
they
have
all
of
the
registration
data
and
everything
else
necessary
to
make
the
bailout
provision.
and
the
only
record
congress
and
the
only
record
before
this
court
is
that
every
single
entity
that
has
sought
a
bailout
has
received
one.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
the
number
is
18.
