justice
antonin
scalia
well,
has
preclearance
been
denied
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
subject
to
preclearance
and
you
cannot
make
changes
without
going
to
the
attorney
general
and
asking
for
his
permission.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
any
different
from,
from
a
(.)
a
federal
law
prohibiting
certain
speech?
do
you
have
to
subject
yourself
to
the
(.)
to
the
penalty
for
that
speech
before
you
can
attack
the
law?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
the
parallel
(.)
the
parallel
isn't
there.
i
mean,
there
are
laws
against
intentional
discrimination.
so
there
should
be
laws
against
wiretapping.
there
should
also
be
laws
against
intentional
discrimination.
but
where
the
(.)
the
argument
here
is
not
that
those
laws
be
eliminated.
it's
just
that
the
preclearance
requirements
be
eliminated.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
long
time
ago.
how
much
of
the
evidence
that
congress
amassed
was
specifically
circumvention
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
comparative,
however.
not
comparative
with
the
rest
of
the
country
except
in
(.)
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
let's
talk
about
the
bailout
provision.
that
(.)
that
was
inserted
in
1982.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
years
is
that?
over
a
quarter
of
a
century,
there
have
been
15
bailouts
that
have
gone
through?
all
of
them
in
the
state
of
virginia?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
bring
this
before
us
as
a
justification
for
the
legislation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
obviously
quite
impracticable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
anybody
to
bail
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
is
whether
it's
right,
not
whether
congress
rejected
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
fends
off
section
2
suits,
i
assume.
i
mean,
that's
great.
you
get
a
declaratory
judgment,
here
(.)
you
know,
a
benediction,
and
you
skip
off
without
having
to
face
suits.
that
may
be
one
reason.
another
reason
may
be
that
they
like
the
packing
of
minorities
and
the
other
(.)
the
other
districting
tricks
that
can
be
(.)
that
can
be
pulled
because
(.)
because
of
the
requirements
of
the
voting
rights
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
get
elected
under
this
system.
why
should
that
they
take
it
away?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
say,
everybody
who
voted
for
this
(.)
this
system
was
elected
under
this
system.
should
it
be
surprising
that
they
think
it
it's
a
good
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are
not
insisting
that
they
(.)
the
other
side
is
not
insisting
that
they
be
kicked
out.
if
they
want
to
voluntarily
stay
in,
fine.
in
fact,
you
should
let
other
states
and
other
jurisdiction
opt
in
if
they
want
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
want
to
make
this
a
voluntary
system
that's
something
entirely
different,
but
the
question
is
assuming
a
state
or
(.)
or
a
covered
jurisdiction
does
not
want
to
be
in,
do
you
have
the
right
to
coerce
them
to
be
in?
that's
all
we
are
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
want
to
stay
in,
that's
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
1980?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
bailout
provision
was
adopted
in
1982,
27
years
ago.
there
have
been
15
bailouts
since
then.
is
that
what
you
think
congress
contemplated
when
it
enacted
the
bailout
provision
in
1982?
justice
antonin
scalia
less
than
one
a
year?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i
understand
it,
is
this
incorrect?
as
i
understand
it
for
travis
county
to
get
a
bailout,
it
would
(.)
it
has
within
travis
county
something
like
106
political
subdivisions
that
are
covered,
and
travis
county
would
have
to
go
to
all
of
those
106
and
demonstrate
that
there
has
been
no
violation
by
any
of
those
106
for
the
preceding
whatever
it
is,
five
years,
whatever
the
bailout
provision
is.
you
think
that's
(.)
you
think
that's
feasible?
justice
antonin
scalia
travis
county
is
not
the
superior
of
many
of
those
subunits,
as
it
is
not
of
this
district
here.
this
district
is
a
subdivision
of
the
state,
but
not
of
travis
county.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
adegbile,
what
was
(.)
i
read
it
in
the
briefs,
and
i
forget
what
it
was.
what
was
the
vote
on
this
2006
extension
(.)
98
to
nothing
in
the
senate,
and
what
was
it
in
the
house?
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--33
to
390.
you
know,
the
(.)
the
israeli
supreme
court,
the
sanhedrin,
used
to
have
a
rule
that
if
the
death
penalty
was
pronounced
unanimously,
it
was
invalid,
because
there
must
be
something
wrong
there.
do
you
ever
expect
(.)
do
you
ever
seriously
expect
congress
to
vote
against
a
reextension
of
the
voting
rights
act?
do
you
really
think
that
any
incumbent
would
(.)
would
vote
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
twenty-five
years
from
now?
fifty
years
from
now?
when?
justice
antonin
scalia
thirty-three
members
of
the
house
and
nobody
in
the
senate.
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
virginia
the
first
state
in
the
union
to
elect
a
black
governor.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
has
a
black
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
currently.
