chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
08-322,
northwest
austin
municipal
utility
district
v.
holder.
mr.
coleman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
may
be
(.)
it
may
be
a
political
subdivision
under
those
decisions,
but
it's
certainly
not
a
political
subdivision
under
the
statutory
definition.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
presumably
you
wouldn't
have
standing
to
raise
it
because
you
wouldn't
be
subject
to
the
preclearance
requirement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
coleman.
mr.
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
the
(.)
the
(.)
our
(.)
our
decision
in
city
of
boerne
said
that
action
under
section
5
has
to
be
congruent
and
proportional
to
what
it's
trying
to
remedy.
here,
as
i
understand
it,
one-twentieth
of
1
percent
of
the
submissions
are
not
precleared.
that,
to
me,
suggests
that
they
are
sweeping
far
more
broadly
than
they
need
to,
to
address
the
intentional
discrimination
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
like
the
old
(.)
you
know,
it's
the
elephant
whistle.
you
know,
i
have
this
whistle
to
keep
away
the
elephants.
you
know,
well,
that's
silly.
well,
there
are
no
elephants,
so
it
must
work.
i
mean,
if
you
have
99.98
percent
of
these
being
precleared,
why
isn't
that
reaching
far
too
broadly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let
me
focus
on
that
historical
aspect.
obviously
no
one
doubts
the
history
here
and
that
the
history
was
different.
but
at
what
point
does
that
history
seek
(.)
stop
justifying
action
with
respect
to
some
jurisdictions
but
not
with
respect
to
others
that
show
greater
disparities?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
so
your
answer
is
that
congress
can
impose
this
disparate
treatment
forever
because
of
the
history
in
the
south?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
can
they
(.)
when
can
they
(.)
when
do
they
have
to
stop?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
said
five
years
originally
and
then
another
20
years.
i
mean,
at
some
point
it
begins
to
look
like
the
idea
is
that
this
is
going
to
go
on
forever.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
didn't
congress
then
extend
the
act
to
massachusetts,
whereas
your
brother
told
us
the
disparity
between
hispanic
and
non-hispanic
voting
is
far
greater
than
jurisdictions
that
are
covered?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
thought
(.)
i
thought
our
opinion
in
city
of
boerne
said
that
the
problem
that
section
5
legislation
addresses
has
to
be
widespread
and
persisting.
do
you
think
the
record
that
is
before
us
today
shows
widespread
and
persisting
discrimination
in
voting?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
adegbile.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
is
it
your
(.)
is
it
your
position
that
today
southerners
are
more
likely
to
discriminate
than
northerners?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
answer
is
yes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
(.)
but
i
guess
that
point
depends
upon
the
assumption
that
shortening
the
time
period
for
early
voting
is
discriminatory
as
opposed
to
good
policy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
was
largely
to
protect
the
incumbent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
incumbent--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--incumbent
protection
takes
place
in
the
north
as
well
as
the
south.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
cases
you're
talking
about
include
both
intentional
and
impact
cases.
and
the
constitution
that
section
5
is
designed
to
implement
covers
only
intentional
discrimination.
so
even
the
examples
you
have
given
sweep
broadly
as
a
prophylactic
measure
and
then
the
section
5
preclearance
of
course
sweeps
even
more
broadly.
so
we
do
have
a
situation,
despite
the
evidence
that
was
(.)
that
you
have
cited,
where
less
than
one-twentieth
of
1
percent
of
the
submissions
that
the
states
make
are
denied
preclearance.
again,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
means
that
section
5
sweeps
very,
very
broadly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
position
is
that
it
makes
no
difference
if
discrimination
in
the
noncovered
jurisdiction
is
more
widespread
and
more
persistent;
it
doesn't
matter,
because
congress
can
focus
solely
on
the
jurisdictions
that
have
been
covered
since
1965?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
guess
your
answer
is
that
they
can
address
the
covered
jurisdictions
that
have
been
covered
since
1965
without
looking
at
all
to
the
rest
of
the
country?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
coleman,
have
you
5
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-322,
northwest
austin
municipal
utility
district
versus
holder.
this
is
a
case
about
the
obligations
imposed
by
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
that
statute
requires
all
covered
jurisdictions
to
seek
preclearance
from
federal
authorities
in
washington,
d.c.
before
they
can
change
anything
about
the
way
they
hold
elections.
that
requirement
applies
only
to
certain
covered
jurisdictions
selected
by
a
formula
congress
created
35
years
ago.
when
the
act
was
passed
in
1965,
the
preclearance
requirement
was
intended
to
last
for
five
years.
congress
has
repeatedly
extended
it.
most
recently
in
2006,
congress
extended
it
for
25
years.
the
appellant
is
a
small
utility
district
with
an
elected
board.
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
is
ever
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race
in
those
elections,
but
it
is
located
in
the
covered
state
of
texas
and
therefore
is
required
to
seek
preclearance
before
it
change
anything
about
its
elections.
another
part
of
the
voting
rights
act
called
the
bailout
provision
cover
--
allows
the
covered
political
subdivision
to
file
a
lawsuit
in
federal
district
court
and
to
be
released
from
the
preclearance
requirements
if
certain
conditions
are
met.
the
district
filed
such
a
bailout
suit.
the
district
also
argued
in
the
alternative
that
if
the
act
does
not
permit
it
to
bail
out,
the
preclearance
requirement
of
section
5
is
unconstitutional.
the
federal
district
court
rejected
both
claims.
it
concluded
that
bailout
is
available
only
to
a
narrow
class
of
political
subdivisions
defined
in
the
act
not
to
an
entity
like
the
district.
it
also
concluded
that
section
5
was
constitutional.
the
utility
district
appealed
and
we
are
therefore
required
to
review
the
district
court
judgment.
unlike
the
situation
with
most
of
the
cases
that
come
before
us,
we
do
not
have
discretion
to
decline
review
of
cases
arising
under
these
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act.
the
historic
accomplishments
of
the
voting
rights
act
are
undeniable.
when
the
act
was
first
passed,
unconstitutional
discrimination
was
rampant
and
the
racial
gap
in
voter
registration
and
turnout.
that
is
the
gap
between
white
registration
and
turnout
compared
to
minority
registration
and
turnout
was
great.
today
that
gap
has
been
dramatically
diminished
and
most
of
the
barriers
to
equal
voting
rights
have
long
been
abolished.
at
the
same
time,
section
5
intrudes
on
the
covered
jurisdictions
in
a
way
otherwise
unfamiliar
to
our
federal
system.
that
aspect
of
the
act
has,
over
the
past
40
years,
caused
various
members
of
the
court
to
express
misgivings
about
the
constitutionality
of
section
5.
section
5
goes
beyond
what
is
prohibited
by
the
fifteenth
amendment.
it
sweeps
broadly
to
suspend
all
voting
changes
however
innocuous
until
they
are
precleared
by
federal
authorities.
and
some
of
the
circumstances
that
we
have
relied
on
in
upholding
section
5
in
the
past
have
unquestionably
changed.
voter
turnout
and
registration
now
approach
parity.
in
the
forms
of
blatant
discrimination
that
were
common
place
when
the
act
was
passed
are
now
rare.
things
have
changed
in
the
south.
those
improvements
are
no
doubt
doing
part
to
the
voting
rights
act
and
they
stand
as
a
monument
to
its
success.
but
the
act
imposes
current
burdens
and
must
be
justified
by
current
needs.
the
act
also
differentiates
between
the
states
and
ways
that
are
intention
with
our
fundamental
tradition
of
equal
sovereignty
among
the
states.
those
distinctions
may
no
longer
be
justified
by
current
conditions.
for
example,
the
racial
gap
between
voter
registration
and
turnout
is
actually
lower
in
the
states
originally
covered
by
section
5
than
it
is
nationwide.
we
recognized
that
judging
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
is,
as
justice
holmes
once
put
it,
the
gravest
and
most
delicate
duty
that
this
court
is
called
upon
to
perform.
we
appreciate
that
the
members
of
congress
take
the
same
oath
we
do
to
uphold
the
constitution.
here,
the
district
court
found
that
the
sizeable
record
compiled
by
congress
in
support
of
extending
section
5
documented
continuing
racial
discrimination.
that
court
also
found
that
the
preclearance
requirement
of
section
5
deterred
discriminatory
changes.
we
will
not
shrink
from
our
duty
as
alexander
hamilton
described
it
in
the
federalist
papers
to
serve
as
the
bulwark
of
limited
constitution
against
legislative
encroachments.
part
of
defining
that
duty
is
the
established
principle
that
normally
we
will
not
decide
a
constitutional
question
if
there
is
another
ground
upon
which
to
dispose
of
the
case.
here,
the
district
also
raises
a
statutory
claim
that
it
is
eligible
to
bail
out
from
the
preclearance
requirement
and
the
principle
of
constitutional
avoidance
demands
that
we
consider
that
claim
before
resting
a
decision
on
the
constitution.
the
act
allows
political
subdivisions
to
seek
to
bail
out
from
the
preclearance
requirements.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
district
is
a
political
subdivision
in
the
ordinary
sense.
but
the
act
provides
a
narrower
statutory
definition
under
which
the
district
does
not
qualify.
the
district
argues
that
the
statutory
definition
is
inapplicable
to
section
5.
now
in
prior
cases,
we
have
held
that
the
statutory
definition
does
not
apply
in
determining
what
entities
must
seek
preclearance
under
the
act
before
instituting
voting
changes.
in
light
of
those
decisions,
that
definition
should
not
constrain
the
availability
of
bailout
either.
there
must
be
symmetry
between
having
to
preclear
and
being
able
to
bail
out.
if
the
statutory
definition
does
not
apply
in
deciding
who
was
covered
as
we
have
held,
it
should
not
apply
in
deciding
who
is
no
longer
covered.
under
the
government's
contrary
interpretation,
the
bailout
provision
has
been
all
but
a
nullity.
since
1982,
only
17
jurisdictions
out
of
more
than
12,000
political
subdivisions
covered
have
successfully
bailed
out
of
the
act.
we
think
it
unlikely
that
congress
intended
the
bailout
provision
to
have
such
limited
effect.
we,
therefore,
hold
that
the
district
is
eligible
to
seek
bailout
under
the
act.
the
district
made
clear
that
a
favorable
decision
on
bailout
was
an
alternative
to
the
ruling
it
seeks
under
the
constitution.
our
statutory
holding,
therefore,
makes
it
unnecessary
for
us
to
reach
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
section
5
and
we
do
not
do
so.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
