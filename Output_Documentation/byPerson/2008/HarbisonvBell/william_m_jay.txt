mr.
william
m.
jay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
3599
authorizes
federally
funded
representation
only
in
the
three
categories
of
proceedings
specified
in
subsection
(e).
at
least
three
distinct
aspects
of
the
statute's
text
and
structure
show
that
the
only
proceedings
included
are
federal
proceedings
before
a
federal
officer.
first,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
during
the
previous
argument,
the
word
(a)(
1).
several
other
terms
in
the
statute,
including
the
phrase
"every
criminal
proceeding",
plainly
refer
to
federal
proceedings
and
federal
proceedings
only.
congress
plainly
saw
no
need
to
include
the
modifier
"federal"
to
make
that
limitation
manifest.
second,
the
statute
requires
that
appointed
attorneys
have
federal
qualifications
based
on
experience
practicing
in
federal
court,
and
it
requires
that
federal
judges
exercise
significant
oversight
of
the
attorney's
representation.
both
these
federal
requirements
for
qualifications
and
federal
requirements
for
oversight
make
sense
only
if
the
proceedings
that
the
--
that
the
qualifications
and
oversight
pertain
to
are
federal
ones.
third,
if
petitioner
were
right
that--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--for
that
--
for
that
habeas
--
for
that
person's
federal
habeas
petition--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--it
requires
the
appointment
of
--
of
a
federal
habeas
attorney
qualified
to
practice
in
federal
court.
mr.
william
m.
jay
in
the
federal
review,
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
subsection
(e)
limits
the
scope
of
that
review,
justice
stevens.
it
specifies
the
types
of
proceedings
that
the
attorney
is
--
is
permitted
to
--
permitted
and,
indeed,
required--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--we
agree
that
(e)
sets
out
the
scope
of
services
to
be
provided
by
the
appointed
attorney
during
the
2254
proceeding.
mr.
william
m.
jay
we
agree
--
we
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
because
we
think
that
term
"proceedings"
each
time--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--we
think,
your
honor,
that
a
habeas
petitioner
who's
coming
to
federal
court
under
section
2254
has
available
to
him
no
proceedings
for
clemency
because
the
term
"proceedings"--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
it's
--
the
menu
of
services,
if
you
will,
set
out
in
subsection
(e)
applies
both
to
lawyers
who
are
appointed
under
(a)(
1)
who
are
doing
work
in
federal
court
for
federal
defendants
facing
a
federal
capital
charge
and
also
for
attorneys
appointed
under
(a)(
2)
who
are
representing
habeas
petitioners
under
section
2254.
because
the
term
(e)
refers
to
federal
proceedings
before
a
federal
officer.
a
2254
petitioner
has
available
to
him
no
proceedings
for
executive
or
other
clemency.
that
person
can
obtain
the
services
that
are
--
that
are
available
to
him
under
subsection
(e),
which
includes
representation
throughout
the
2254
proceedings.
mr.
william
m.
jay
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
jay
subsection
(e)
would
not
authorize
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
your
honor,
state
courts
also
appoint
counsel.
mr.
william
m.
jay
there's
nothing--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--would
not
get
paid
by
the
federal
government
for
litigating
a
matter
in
state
court
that
may
have
no
connection
to
federal
law.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
your
honor,
i
--
it
would
not
be
a
federal
judicial
proceeding,
and,
therefore,
it
would
not
be
covered--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--by
subsection
(a)(
2).
mr.
william
m.
jay
we
--
we
think
that
the
federal
limitation
applies
throughout
the
text
of
3599.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
am
sorry,
justice--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
federal
limitation
is
apparent
from
a
number
of
aspects
of
the
statute,
including
the
fact
that
congress
didn't
use
the
"federal"
modifier
anywhere
else
in
the
statute.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
if
it
had
inserted
the
word
"federal"
in
some
places
and
left
it
out
in
others,
that
might
be
probative
intent
--
probative
evidence
that
congress
intended
the
--
the
other
instances
to
be
federal
and
state
as
well.
but
we
don't
have
that
here.
we
have
--
we
have
terms
that
are
clearly
indicated
to
be
federal
only
in
nature
such
as
every
criminal
proceeding
in
(a)(
1).
mr.
william
m.
jay
but
the
--
subsection
(e)
doesn't
bar
the
lawyer
from
doing
that.
and
two
points
on
that:
there
might
be
other
sources
of
funding
available;
and
indeed,
the
same
lawyer
who
need
not
be
a
federal
defender
--
he
may
be
a
panel
attorney
appointed
--
in
private
practice
appointed
from
the
district
court's
panel
of
available
attorneys
who
meet
the
federal
qualifications.
mr.
william
m.
jay
he
may
be
appointed
as
well.
mr.
william
m.
jay
in
capital
cases
for
fiscal
year
2008,
it's
$170
an
hour.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
your
honor--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
your
honor,
the
limitations
in
subsection
(e)
are
--
are
there
for
a
reason,
and
it's
precisely
because
the
state
--
the
state
post-conviction
process
that
would
become
available
under
petitioner's
reading
of
the
statute
is
certainly
not
limited
to
a
few
hours
spent
on
the
eve
of
execution
in
state
court.
it
potentially
could
include
returning
to
state
court
for
any
form
of
post-conviction
process
at
any
time
after
the
federal
habeas
application
is
filed.
whether--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
think
it
isn't,
justice
breyer,
because
2254
is
not
a
reference
to
proceedings
in
state
court.
a
2254
proceeding
is
in
federal
court.
it
involves
federal
constitutional
issues
in
a
federal
constitutional
challenge
to
the
legitimacy
of
the--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
i--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
your
honor,
let
me
answer
your
point
about
congressman
conyers
first
because
i
think
that
the
suggestion
in
petitioner's
brief
is
that
congressman
conyers
was
--
had
misinterpreted
the
text
of
his
own
amendment.
and
as
we
have
shown,
the
text
of
the
amendment
proposed
by
congressman
conyers
in
the
house
and
the
text
of
the
amendment
proposed
by
senator
levin
in
the
senate
using
the
--
using
virtually
the
--
the
identical
language,
each
of
them
provided
no
funding
for--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
your
honor,
the
text
of
congressman
conyers'
amendment
wiped
out
the
gekas
amendment.
it
replaced
subsections
(q)(
1)
through
(q)(
4)
of
the
gekas
amendment.
subsection
(q)(
4)
is
what
you
are
referring
to,
referring
to
2254
petitioners.
congressman
conyers
replaced
that
with
his
--
with
a
lengthy
piece
of
legislation
that
is
the
predecessor
of
what
appears
in
the
statute
today,
and
it
made
no
provision
whatsoever
for
2254
petitioners,
even
those
appearing
in
federal
court.
now,
your
previous
question
to
me,
which
i
didn't
get
--
which
i'd
like
to
come
back
to,
is
about
the
2254
representation.
when
a
state
prisoner
comes
to
federal
court
raising
a
constitutional
challenge
to
his
conviction
in
a
2254
proceeding,
there
there's
a
direct
federal
interest.
you
know,
federal
rights
are
at
stake,
and
it
makes
sense
that
congress
was
providing
counsel
for
the
vindication
of
those
federal
rights.
that
is
not
so
with
the
clemency
proceedings
before
a
state
governor,
which
are
a
matter
of
grace,
they
don't
turn
on
federal
issues,
and
they
don't
deal
with
an
inmate
under
a
federal
sentence
of
death.
mr.
william
m.
jay
we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
purpose
of
that
phrase,
which
was
added,
as
i
--
as
i
tried
to
explain
in
my
previous
answer,
was
added
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
funding
available
for
a
2254
petitioner.
we
think
the
purpose
of
that
language
is
to
be
as
capacious
as
possible
when
a
federal
defendant
seeks
clemency,
and
that
--
recognizing
that
the
proceedings
for
clemency
in
which
counsel
might
be
helpful
might
include
proceedings
that
don't
take
place
before
the
chief
executive
himself,
and
there
are
a
couple
of
examples
--
throughout
history,
presidents
have
enlisted
the
assistance
of
various
people,
including
individuals
who
don't
work
for
the
executive
branch.
mr.
william
m.
jay
we
agree,
your--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--we
don't
disagree
with
that
at
all,
justice
souter,
but
we
think
that
the
phrase
"or
other"
was
simply
congress'
attempt
to
make
sure
that
proceedings
before
these
other
officers
were--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--should
the
constitution
be
amended
to
permit
--
to
permit
legislative
clemency,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
that
is
right.
but
at
any
rate,
the
phrase
"or
other",
we
don't
think
that
it's
a
sub
silentio
or
at
least
a
very
subtle
way
of
indicating
state
clemency
because,
as
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
existence
of
non-executive
clemency
in
the
states
is
--
in
every
state
that
has
the
death
penalty,
clemency
is
a
matter
--
is
a
decision
made
by
the
governor
or
his
appointees
or
other
executive
officials.
mr.
william
m.
jay
in
terms
of
the
numbers
of
clients,
yes,
you
are,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
we
think
the
entire
statute
is
intended
to
focus
on
when
--
when
federal
rights
and
federal
interests
are
at
stake
in
the
administration
of
the
death
penalty.
and
in
the
clemency
context,
because
clemency
does
not
actually
--
does
not
involve
the
vindication
of
a
federal
right
or
a
--
a
constitutional
right
at
all,
that
the
number
of
instances
where
the
clemency
process
actually
involves
such
a
federal
right
is--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--limited
to
the
category--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--there
are
sometimes
such
arguments
made
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
clemency,
and
indeed
the
governor
or
the
president--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
there
is
a
--
in
a
capital
clemency
proceeding,
the
court
has
recognized
a
--
a
limited
due
process
right,
but
that
is
not
the
sort
of
right
that
would
be
vindicated
in
a
--
in
a
habeas
proceeding
at
all.
mr.
william
m.
jay
that's
right,
your
honor;
(a)(
1)
applies
only
in
federal
proceedings.
mr.
william
m.
jay
that's
correct,
your
honor.
so
many
of
the
--
many
of
the
provisions
in
(e),
even
on
petitioner's
reading
which
places
great
reliance
on
the
"subsequent
stage"
language,
many
of
these
provisions,
such
as
pretrial
proceedings,
trial,
sentencing,
would
apply
only
to
the
limited
number
of
federal
death
penalty
defendants.
we
don't
think
that--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--it
is
the
principal
thrust
of
our
concern.
i
think
that's
fair
to
say,
justice
kennedy.
and
that's
because
the
term
(e),
we
think
that
either
that
that's
limited
to
federal
proceedings
each
time
it
appears
or
it's
not
each
time
it
appears.
so--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--we
don't
see
a
way
to
have
a
federal
limitation
before
judicial
proceedings
and
not
have
it
before
clemency
proceedings.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
in
every
state
with
the
death
penalty,
the
clemency
decision
is
made
either
by
the
--
in
most
cases,
by
the
governor
or
by
gubernatorial
appointees
or
by
other
executive
officials.
and
the
petitioner
has
suggested
that
gubernatorial
appointees,
for
that
purpose,
might
be
"other".
but,
there
is
--
there
are
no
--
been
able
to
find
no
instances
of,
for
example,
legislative
clemency
in
a
capital
case.
that
is
limited.
there
are
constitutional
provisions
that
the
tenth
circuit
relied
on
to
assert
that
there
is
such
an
institution
of
legislative
clemency.
that's
limited
to
treason
against
the
state,
a
noncapital
felony
or
mostly
noncapital
felony
that
we
--
we
can't
find
a
treason
against
the
state
prosecution
since
the
1940s.
mr.
william
m.
jay
i
think
if
your
premise,
justice
souter,
were
--
is
right,
that
congress
intended
to
fund
--
fund
proceedings
on
both
levels,
then
i
--
i
suspect
that
that's
right,
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
congress
which
form
the
state
clemency
process
took.
but
we
think
that
congress
intended
to
fund
only
those
proceedings
in
which
there
are
federal
rights
or
federal
interests
at
stake,
and
state
clemency
proceedings
do
not
meet
that
qualification.
and
the--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
the
phrase
is
--
the
phrase
is
ambiguous.
we've
turned
to
legislative
history
to
partially
resolve
that
ambiguity,
because,
as
--
as
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief
and
i
alluded
to
earlier,
they
were
added
--
they
were
added
at
a
time
when
funding
wasn't
contemplated
for
2254
proceedings
at
all.
even
if
that
--
even
if
that
weren't
the
case,
we
would
think
that
because
of
the
impact
on
the
federal
--
state
balance
that
would
--
that
would
result
from
funding
these
state
--
state
proceedings,
that
that's
not
the
kind
of
clear
statement
that
would
qualify.
and
so
i
mentioned
before,
one
of
the
two
possibilities
that
we
see
for
what
"or
other"
might
mean,
which
would
be--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
jay
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
jay
the
federal
government
would
be
funding
that.
we
see
another
instance
in
which
there
is
a
--
an
impact
on
the
federal-state
balance,
which
is
the
fact
that
--
that
if,
on
petitioner's
reading,
the
attorney
must
return
--
must
go
to
state
court
or
go
into
state
proceedings
and
continue
the
representation
there,
they
still
answer
to
the
federal
judge,
who
supervises
their
appointment,
supervises
their
qualifications,
and
determines
whether
and
to
what
extent
they
will
be
paid.
and
of
critical
importance,
the
federal
judge
determines
when
the
attorney
will
be
permitted
to
withdraw.
and
the
federal
judge
may
not
permit
such
a
withdrawal,
unless
and
until
the
federal
judge
can
find
another
attorney
who
meets
the
same
qualifications
for
the
federal
appointment.
so
you
would
have,
on
petitioner's
reading,
an
attorney
appointed
by
a
federal
court
who
would
go
into
state
judicial
proceedings
and
would
be
unable
to
ask
the
state
tribunal
before
whom
he
or
she
was
appearing
for
permission
to
withdraw
from
the
engagement.
he
or
she
would
have
to
return
to
the
federal
court
for
that
permission.
we
see
that
as
a
direct
--
direct
infringement
on
the
state
tribunal
process.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
i
think
--
this
statute,
your
honor,
doesn't
deal
with
discretion.
it
deals
with
"shall".
and
--
so
we
don't
think
that
it's
possible
under
this
statute.
it
is
possible.
now,
there
is
another
provision
in
federal
court
for
the
appointment
of
counsel,
the
criminal
justice
act,
18
u.s.c.
3006(a),
and
that
provision,
which
was
in
existence
long
before
this
statute,
used
to
permit
discretionary
appointment
of
counsel
in
2254
cases.
and
it
--
it
does
contain
a
provision
for
some
ancillary
representation.
it
is
possible
that
an
attorney
might
be
able
to
invoke
that
provision,
which
has
its
own
legislative
history--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
don't
--
i
don't
think
we
have
a
--
have
a
position
on
that
issue,
because
it--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--it
--
it
might,
your
honor,
because
the
criminal
justice
act
applies
to
noncapital
cases
as
well.
but
i
have
not
seen
it
litigated.
and
so,
i
don't
think
that
we've
taken
a
position
on
it.
but
that
is
--
that
is
a
potential
source
for
discretionary
funding.
but
the
suggestion
that
subsection
(e)
permits
some
exercise
of
discretion
because
of
the
inclusion
of
"and
other
appropriate
motions
and
procedures.
"
i
don't
think
that
works
in
this
case
to
cabin
the
necessary
implications
of
petitioner's
reading,
because
the
three
categories
of
proceedings
are
judicial
proceedings,
competency
proceedings,
and
proceedings
for
executive
or
other
clemency.
and
each
of
the
examples,
from
pretrial
proceedings
down
through
applications
for
stays
of
execution
and
other
appropriate
motions
and
procedures,
fall
into
the
category
of
judicial
proceedings.
it's
our
position
that
those
are
to
be
federal
proceedings,
not
proceedings
in
state
court.
anything
that
--
that
is
on
that
list,
from
--
again
from
pretrial
proceedings
down
through
--
at
least
through
all
available
post-conviction
process,
that's
--
that's
not
discretionary,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
district
court
could
decide
that,
even
though
something
were
available
post-conviction
process,
it
was
not
to
be
funded
because
the
district
court
deemed
it
not
to
be
appropriate.
and
many
of
the
filings
that
a
habeas
counsel
might
wish
to
make
in
state
court,
if
the
petitioner's
reading
were
adopted,
would
fall
under
the
category
of
available
post-conviction
process,
a
successive
writ
of
habeas
corpus
or
a
writ
of
coram
nobis,
such
as
the
--
the
one
that
petitioner
litigated
in
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
while
its
federal
habeas
proceeding
was
pending.
mr.
william
m.
jay
there
are
some
funds
on
--
on
the
state
level,
and
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
how
tennessee
handles
that
in
a
moment.
but
as
a
--
as
a
general
answer
to
your
question,
the
statute
does
not
make
clear
that
if
petitioner
can
obtain
counsel
at
no
cost
to
himself,
that
he's
no
longer
eligible
for
federal
counsel
under
this
provision,
because
he,
after
all,
would
still
be
indigent.
and
i
think
the
situation
that
occurred
here
in
the
tennessee
courts
highlights
the
--
the
difficulty
that
would
be
raised
by
creating
a
--
by
permitting
funding
for
state
proceedings.
the
tennessee
post-conviction
defender
is
authorized
by
statute
to
represent
inmates
under
a
sentence
of
death
in
post-conviction
and
clemency
proceedings
in
state
court,
and
he
has
discretion
over
the
clemency
portion.
the
post-conviction
defender
in
this
case
declined
to
use
his
--
to
use
his
resources
to
represent
petitioner
in
the
clemency
proceedings,
because
he
--
he
determined
that
he
didn't
have
the
resources
and
he
was
focusing
on
other
cases.
so,
at
least
as
a
matter
of
tennessee
law,
that
that
option
was
available
to
him,
but
it's
not
been
suggested
that
he
is
not
himself
financially
unable
to
obtain
counsel.
so,
in
--
in
any
instance
like
that
in
which
there
is
--
there
are,
in
some
circumstances,
state-funded
counsel
available,
i
think
you
would
set
--
you
would
create
a
powerful
incentive
for
the
state
to
say
it
wishes
to
go
second,
that
allowed
the
federal
--
allow
federal
funding
to
come
first
and
state
funding
to
come
second,
and
for
the
federal
government
to
respond
in
like
measure.
mr.
william
m.
jay
right.
our
position,
justice
scalia,
is--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--whether
you
as
a
personal
matter--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--are
financially
unable.
mr.
william
m.
jay
and
the
--
the
test
for
appointment
is
also
based
on
when
the
--
at
the
time
when
the
defendant
is
or
becomes
financially
unable,
there's
no
reference
in
the
statute
to
when
--
to
the
defendant
becoming
financially
able
again.
it
has
been
interpreted
in
some
instances
to
permit
revisiting
that
financial
ability
decision,
but
in
circumstances
unlike
what
we
are
discussing
here,
where
the
state
provides
free
counsel.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
it
doesn't
hurt,
your
honor,
and
we
do
think
that
it
helps
because--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
i'm
certainly
not
here
to
confess
to
error,
your
honor.
we
--
we
do
think
that
it
--
that
it
helps
our
argument
because,
to
the
extent
that
there's
any
ambiguity
or
there's
any
doubt
left
in
the
court's
mind,
i
think
the
fact
that
congress
chose
to
use
the
same
words
again--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--other
than
the
general
presumption
that
this
court
applies
in
these
ratification
cases,
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
can't
--
we
can't
point
to
a
particular
committee
report
or
colloquy.
the
--
the
term
3599(e).
clemency
proceedings,
judicial
proceedings,
and
competency
proceedings,
we
submit,
are
made
clear
by
the
text
and
structure
of
the
statute
to
refer
only
to
federal
proceedings.
adopting
petitioner's
reading,
even
if
--
even
though
in
this
case
it
refers
only
to
a
clemency
proceeding,
would
inevitably
lead
to
federal
funding
for
--
for
any
proceeding
on
the
state
level
that
meets
one
of
the
descriptions
set
out
in
subsection
(e).
clemency
would
be
a
particularly
poor
candidate
for
such
funding
because
a
clemency
decision
before
a
state
governor,
which
may
indeed
be
initiated
before
the
--
before
the
inmate
comes
to
federal
court
for
a
habeas
petition,
implicates
no
federal
rights
and
implicates
no
federal
interests.
for
those
reasons
we
submit
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
