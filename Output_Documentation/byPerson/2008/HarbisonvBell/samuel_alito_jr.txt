justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
that's
possibly
a
plain
reading
of
the
statutory
language.
you
started
out
by
saying
you're
relying
on
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statutory
language.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
you
get
that
out
of
the
statutory
language
of
(e)?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
now
you're
out
of
the
plain
language
of
(e),
and
you're
looking
at
the
context
of
the
whole
statute.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
your
answer
to
the
plain
language
of
(e)?
that
was
your
prime
--
that
was
the
argument
you
started
out
with,
that
this
fell
under
the
plain
language
of
(e).
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
you
explain
under
the
plain
language
of
(e)
why
--
how
you
avoid
the
result
that
once
habeas
counsel
is
appointed
in
federal
court,
the
counsel
has
to
appear
in
all
of
these
other
proceedings?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
new
trial
in
state
court,
et
cetera.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
it
not
be
a
subsequent
stage
of
available
judicial
proceedings?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
it
not
a
subsequent
stage
of
available
judicial
proceedings?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
without
using
the
words
(e),
and
i'm
still
struggling
to
understand
what
you're
doing
with
the
plain
language
of
(e).
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
remand
--
what
if
the
remand
is
for
state
post-conviction
review,
and
there
is
no
attorney
available
under
state
law
for
state
postconviction
review?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
only
things
in
federal
court.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i
thought
it
was
your
position
that
it
didn't
apply
in
that
situation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
it
was
your
position
that
it
did
not
apply
in
that
situation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
you
think
it's
discretionary.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
court
can
--
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
can
order
the
--
the
counsel
who's
appointed
to
represent
the
--
the
petitioner
in
the
habeas
to
go
back
and
handle
the
exhaustion
of
a
claim
in
state
court.
