chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
afternoon
in
case
07-8521,
harbison
v.
bell.
ms.
chavis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
interpretation
would
make
all
of
the
provisions
of
subsection
(e)
applicable
in
state
proceedings,
so
long
as
there's
been
a
2254
petition
filed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
where
are
you
reading,
the
first
part,
"available
post-conviction
process"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
doesn't
modify
what
comes
before
it,
does
it?
new
trial,
appeals?
in
other
words,
if
--
if
at
the
end
of
the
habeas
proceeding,
things
start
all
over,
then
presumably
the
appointed
counsel
represents
the
defendant
throughout
all
those
new
proceedings?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sure
i'm
missing
something
here,
because
the
statute
does
say
"all
available
post-conviction
process".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
just
saying
a
new
trial
because
you
succeed
on
habeas
is
not
postconviction
process?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
--
well
then,
if
you
look
up
earlier
in
the
statute,
it
says,
"shall
represent
the
defendant
throughout
every
subsequent
stage
of
available
judicial
proceedings.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
--
why
doesn't
it
fall
under
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
work.
the
language
you
just
quoted
is
simply
to
say
when
you
get
somebody
appointed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
financially
unable,
so
you
get
somebody
appointed.
then
you
go
back
and
say
that
person
shall
represent
you
through
every
subsequent
stage.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
say
that,
oh,
if
you
suddenly
get
somebody
else
appointed,
you
know,
then
you
can
--
then
he
doesn't
have
that
obligation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
why
don't
we
interpret
the
clemency
provision
the
same
way,
as
being
limited
to
federal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
within
the
use
of
"federal",
what
we
were
just
talking
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
know
why
you
just
didn't
take
the
position
and
say,
yes,
it
applies
to
all
these
provisions.
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
a
--
to
doom
your
position
at
all.
once
you
have
somebody
have
appointed
who
helps
you
on
the
federal
habeas
--
presumably
they
do
a
lot
of
work,
they
get
up
to
speed
on
everything
--
they
ought
to
represent
you
through
the
next
stage
of
available
proceedings.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
see
why
--
i
mean,
if
you
say,
well,
the
first
part
is
implicitly
only
federal,
that
makes
it
very
hard
for
you
to
argue
that
the
second
part
is
not
also
implicitly
only
federal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
step
back
and
look
at
the
structure,
it
seems
to
me
unusual
that
your
interpretation
would
be
correct.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
more
likely
that
congress
wanted
this
counsel
to
continue
on
in
state
proceedings,
trials.
the
clemency
thing
seems
a
little
bit
more
removed.
it's
a
different
--
different
argument
--
you
know,
we're
guilty,
but
show
us
mercy
--
than
what
may
well
be
the
same
sort
of
argument
on
the
subsequent
state
proceeding
as
was
raised
in
the
federal
habeas.
i
mean,
if
--
if
i
were
writing
this,
i
would
want
them
to
continue
in
the
subsequent
state
proceedings
before
i'd
want
them
to
continue
--
before
i'd
want
to
have
them
represent
the
defendant
in
clemency.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
says
"adequate
representation".
and
then
later
on
it
says
the
lawyers
we
appoint
here
have
to
have
5
years'
experience,
3
years'
experience
in
felony
trials.
i
think
that's
a
lot
better
than
most
of
the
attorneys
who
are
going
to
be
appointed
under
the
state
system.
so
i
would
say,
look,
this
statute
itself
recognizes
that
this
person
you
have
appointed
under
the
state
system
is
not
adequate.
they
say
you've
got
to
have
5
years/3
years.
so
i
want
one
of
those.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
put
a
lot
of
weight
on
--
i
mean,
the
--
the
problem
arises
because
congress
did
not
specify
whether
it
was
limited
to
federal
or
state.
and
yet
you're
saying
they
were
--
what
they
clearly
meant
to
do
when
they
said
"executive
or
other
clemency"
was
to
signal
implicitly
that
it
must
cover
state
because
there's
no
other
kind
of
clemency.
it's
--
it's
kind
of
a
real
round-about
way
to
make
that
point,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
somebody
is
not
going
to
sit
there
and
say,
oh,
we
put
"other"
in
because
we
know
that
in
the
federal
system
it's
only
executive,
but
in
the
state
system
there
might
be
others.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
guy
wouldn't
suddenly
say,
well,
maybe
we
should
say
this
is
meant
to
cover
the
state
system.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
jay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
doubt
in
the
scenario
justice
stevens
hypothesized
that
the
federal
defender
would,
in
fact,
represent
the
person
before
the
state
court.
you
are
in
an
emergency
stay
situation.
he's
--
he's
allowed
to
go
to
federal
court.
he
does
so.
the
federal
judge
says,
you
got
to
go
back
to
state
court.
there's
12
hours
left.
he's
not
going
to
say,
you
know,
get
another
lawyer.
he's
going
to
represent
the
person
before
the
state
court.
and
i
gather
he
can
do
that.
he's
just
not
going
to
get
paid
for
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
he
presumably--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
spending
a
huge
amount
of
time
and
resources
on
this
--
in
the
nature
of
these
proceedings,
and
you
want
to
go
back
and
say,
all
right,
on
this
day
you
spent
6
hours
redoing
your
papers
that
were
filed
before
the
federal
judge
to
file
them
before
the
state
judge,
and
you
don't
get
paid
the
--
whatever
--
how
--
what
do
cja
attorneys
get
paid
these
days?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
he
goes
back
and
says,
look,
you
don't
get
that.
you
know,
you
get
the
$15,000
you
spent
in
the
last
10
days
on
this,
but
you
don't
get
the
$810.
that
--
does
it
seem
reasonable
to
impose
that
burden
on
the
public
defender?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
since
you
know
as
a
practical
matter,
because
of
professional
responsibility,
that
person
is
going
to
represent
the
defendant
in
the
state
court
proceedings.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
counsel,
you
lead.
[laughter]
we
direct
our
questions
to
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
do
with
"other"?
i
mean,
there
is
no
"other"
clemency
for
federal
defendants.
right?
it's
just
executive
clemency?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
don't
really
think
the
fact
that
this
provision
was
recodified
helps
your
argument
at
all,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
i
see
that
argument,
particularly
in
a
gray
brief,
that
strikes
me
as
tantamount
to
a
confession
of
error.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
were
earlier
resisting
the
notion
that
the
particular
legislative
history
here
showed
anything
because
of
how
broadly
it
may
have
been
familiar,
but
there's
no
evidence
at
all
that
when
congress
recodified
this
language,
it
was
in
fact
aware
of
the
different
court
of
appeals
decisions
you
cite.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
jay.
ms.
chavis,
you
have
a
minute
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
often
is
clemency
granted
in
tennessee?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
time
in
the
last
how
many
decades?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
the
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-8521,
harbison
versus
bell.
