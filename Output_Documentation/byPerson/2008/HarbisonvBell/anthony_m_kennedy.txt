well,
but
he
couldn't
find
it's
inappropriate,
could
he?
if
you're
again
talking
about
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
i
don't
see
there's
much
room
for
the
district
judge
to
say:
well,
now,
i'm
not
going
to
say
that
you
have
to
participate
in
further
state
post-conviction
proceedings.
this
is
unexhausted
claim.
it
seems
to
me
under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
the
appointed
counsel,
say,
in
an
unexhausted
claim
instance,
would
have
to,
under
the
statute,
represent
the
defendant
in
further
state
collateral
post-conviction
proceedings.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
--
you
would
interpret
"all
available
post-conviction
process"
as
meaning
federal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
make
clear
what
your
position
is.
federal
determination
on
habeas
corpus,
that
--
that
there
are
unexhausted
claims
ordered
returned
to
the
state
court.
is
the
appointed
counsel
required
under
the
statute
to
represent
the
defendant
in
the
state
court,
further
post-conviction
proceedings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
to
take
that
position?
but
that
is
your--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
that
is
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
government's
principal
concern
in
this
case
the
possibility,
the
potential,
assuming
the
petitioner
prevails,
of
appointment
of
counsel
in
state
post-conviction
collateral
proceedings,
i.e.,
when
there
are
unexhausted
claims?
apparently
the
sixth
circuit
en
banc
addressed
this.
and
in
your
brief
you
indicate
that
there's
a
number
of
additional
claims
left.
is
--
is
that
the
principal
thrust
of
your
concern,
rather
than
clemency?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
there's
no
way
to
interpret
the
statute
so
that
it
could
include
state
clemency
proceedings
but
only
federal
post-conviction
review
proceedings
in
judicial
--
before
judicial
tribunals?
