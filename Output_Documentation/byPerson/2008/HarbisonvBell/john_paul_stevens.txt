john
paul
stevens
but
if
it
did
not
have
the
"including"
phrase,
if
it
just
stopped
there,
would
it
then
include
proceedings
necessary
to
exhaust
the
state
remedies?
i'm
a
little
unclear
why
you
think
it
does
not
include
necessary
--
proceedings
necessary
to
exhaust
state
remedies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
doesn't
the
word
"shall"
require
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
seem
reasonable
that
congress
would
have
--
suppose
you
had
a
real
complicated
case
with
five
or
six
issues
in
it,
and
they
find
out
one
issue
is
not
exhausted.
the
capital
case
has
been
around
for
2
or
3
years.
did
congress
think,
well,
you've
got
to
go
on
your
own
when
you
go
back
to
the
state
court
now
and
exhaust
that
one
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
where
is
that
language
again,
"appropriate
motions
and"--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
that's
in
the
next
--
next
clause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
does
--
why
does
that
limit
the
interpretation
that
--
of
the
words
"subsequent
stage"
--
"throughout
every
subsequent
stage
of
available
judicial
proceedings?
"
and
isn't
the
state
collateral
proceeding
which
is
necessary
to
exhaust
a
remedy
fall
right
within
that
language?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
make
sure
i
understand
your
position?
does
(a)(
2)
authorize
a
federal
judge
to
appoint
counsel
for
a
--
a
person
on
death
row
under
a
state
death
conviction
under
2254
or
2255?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
--
he
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer
in
the
--
in
the
federal
collateral
review
of
a
state
death
penalty
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
in
the
statute
limits
the
scope
of
that
review?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
--
but
you
agree
that
(e)
applies
to
state
prisoners.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
--
for
a
state
prisoner
in
a
federal
collateral
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
--
and
what,
then,
in
that
proceeding
does
the
word
"clemency"
refer
to?
is
that
clemency
by
the
president
of
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
statute
says
so
in
so
many
words.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
supposing,
on
the
eve
of
execution,
he
wanted
to
apply
for
a
stay
of
execution,
he'd
be
entitled
to
representation
before
a
federal
judge.
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
the
federal
judge
says,
you
have
to
--
under
our
practice
you
can't
get
a
federal
stay
without
first
exhausting
your
attempt
to
get
a
state
stay.
could
he
represent
the
defendant
applying
for
a
--
in
the
state
court
for
a
stay
of
execution
in
that
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he'd
have
to
get
a
separate
counsel
to
--
to
go
to
the
state
court
because
--
even
though
the
federal
judge
required
him
as
a
normal
matter
of
practice
to
exhaust
the
state
remedy
under
the
very
limited
situation
of
a
stay
on
the
eve
of
execution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
would
have
no
right
to
have
his
federal
lawyer
get
paid
for
doing
that
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
litigating
that
--
just
for
the
--
this,
for
the
stay
application
on
the
eve
of
execution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
comes
in
with
the
--
the
general
language
of
"other
appropriate
motions
and
procedures",
and
so
forth.
that's
got
to
be
tailored
back
to
mean
other
appropriate
motions
and
procedures
in
a
federal
tribunal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that's
perfectly
clear
from
the
text
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that's
perfectly
clear
from
the
text
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
could
have
used
the
"federal"
modifier
very
easily
just
by
inserting
the
word
"federal"
at
appropriate
places.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jay,
would
you
comment
on
this
general
reaction
i
had
to
--
when
i
read
the
statute?
i
had
the
impression
that
most
lawyers
appointed
under
this
statute
would
be
to
represent
defendants
in
state
execution
cases,
and
there
--
there
are
a
few
cases
where
they're
federal
death
penalty
cases,
but
not
very
many
across
the
whole
spectrum.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
so
the
case
is
primarily
dealing
with
the
representation
of
state
defendants
in
capital
proceedings,
and
the
number
of
cases
in
federal
proceedings
where
at
the
last
minute
there's
a
plea
for
executive
clemency
is
very
rare.
and
you
think
this
particular
provision
we're
debating
here
was
really
intended
just
to
take
care
of
the
rare
case
where
a
federal
defendant
is
on
death
row
seeking
executive
clemency,
and
not
even
to
consider
all
the
cases
in
which
--
in
state
--
that
originate
in
state
trials,
where
there's
a
lot
of
applications
for
executive
clemency.
you
think
it
was
intended
to
focus
on
that
very
narrow
category.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
are
occasionally
federal
constitutional
questions
and
sometimes
arguments
made
in
federal
clemency
--
i
mean,
in
state
clemency
proceedings
and
federal
clemency
proceedings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
arguably
a
federal
right,
a
constitutional
right,
to
a
fair
proceeding
in
a
clemency
application.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
be
clear
on
--
on
one
thing
on
your
position,
mr.
jay?
is
it
your
view
that
the
federal
judge
may
not
allow
the
lawyer
to
do
anything
in
--
in
an
unexhausted
claim,
or
does
he
have
some
discretion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
government's
position
on
that
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
issue
would
arise
more
often
than
the
issue
we're
fighting
about
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
death
by
a
tennessee
court
in
1983.
five
years
later,
congress
enacted
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
of
1988
which
create
a
new
capital
offense.
section
3599
of
that
act
authorized
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
represent
indigent
defendants
in
capital
cases
including
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings
challenging
death
sentences
imposed
in
state
courts
and
also
in
"proceedings
for
executive
or
other
clemency".
in
1997,
after
petitioner
exhausted
his
state
remedies,
a
federal
district
judge
appointed
counsel
to
represent
him
in
a
federal
challenge
to
his
death
sentence.
that
challenge
was
ultimately
unsuccessful.
the
question
that
is
now
presented
to
us
is
whether
section
3599
authorizes
his
attorney
to
represent
him
in
tennessee's
clemency
proceedings.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
although
such
representation
is
authorized
for
federal
clemency
proceedings,
it
is
not
authorized
for
a
state
clemency
proceeding.
we
disagree.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
section
3599
does
authorize
federally
appointed
counsel
to
represent
their
clients
in
state
clemency
proceedings
and
entitles
them
to
compensation
for
that
representation.
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
have
filed
separate
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
alito
has
joined.
