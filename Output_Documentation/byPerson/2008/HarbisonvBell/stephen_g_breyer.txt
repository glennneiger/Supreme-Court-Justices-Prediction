justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
we
have
to
reach
that
question
here?
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
three
things
that
you've
said.
you've
said
that
it
says
"federal".
i
don't
see
any
place
it
says
"federal".
it
doesn't
use
that
word.
then
you
say
it
doesn't
say
"federal
and
state".
in
my
copy
it
does
say
"federal
and
state".
it
talks
about
2254
and
2255.
so
if
i
just
read
this
in
english,
it
says
that
once
you
appoint
the
person,
and
it's
either
state
or
federal
--
it's
2254
and
2255
--
that
person
shall
also
represent
the
defendant
in
such
competency
proceedings
and
proceedings
for
executive
or
other
clemency
as
may
be
available
to
the
defendant.
q.e.d.
end
of
the
case.
all
right,
now
why
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
they're
referring
to
people
who
are
under
state
death
penalty
or
federal
death
penalty.
and
what
it
says
is
that
they
shall
get
a
person
to
represent
them
in
these
later
habeas
proceedings.
and
then
it
adds
that
that
person
--
and
no
point
quoting
it
again.
you
heard
what
i
just
said.
it
adds
that
that
person
will
represent
them
in
clemency
proceedings.
now,
is
there
any
reason
for
thinking
that
congress
--
and
contrary
to
some
things
mentioned,
i
believe
that
probably
congressman
conyers
did
read
what
he
wrote.
he
certainly
referred
to
it
enough
in
speeches,
and
those
speeches
make
very
clear
to
me
that
that's
what
he
had
in
mind,
what
it
says.
now,
other
people
can
read
it
differently,
but
--
but
i
--
i
mean,
i've
read
it.
i
read
the
language.
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
happened
to
be
the
person
who
wrote
it,
and
it's
referred
to
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
and
on
page
21
--
i
took
what
you
said,
i
went
back
and
looked
it
up,
just
as
you
might
have
suggested
i
would
by
putting
in
the
relevant
citations.
okay?
so
having
looked
it
up,
as
implicitly
you
suggested,
i
think
conyers
knew
what
he
said.
i
think
he
did
mean
those
words
to
say
what
it
says,
but
you
can
convince
me
to
the
contrary.
that's
why
i
raise
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
they
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
experience
in
congress
is
that
the
members
of
congress
do
know
the
kinds
of
things
that
they
are
voting
on.
maybe
others
have
different
experiences.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
you're
wrong
about
that.
the
reason
i
think
you're
wrong
about
that
is
that
that
language
to
which
you
refer
is
language
that
congressman
conyers
himself
introduced
in
response
to
a
bill
by
representative
gekas,
and
in
representative
gekas'
bill
he
referred,
just
like
this
one,
to
both
state
defendants
and
to
the
federal
defendants.
and
the
purpose
of
conyers'
amendment,
which
was
to
substitute
for
the
gekas
amendment,
was
to
extend,
not
to
limit,
what
gekas
has
done.
and
he
introduced
lots
of
information,
all
of
which
referred
almost
uniquely
to
state
defendants.
that's
then
picked
up
in
the
senate,
and
the
senate,
which
is
levin,
is
trying
to
do
precisely
what
conyers
was
trying
to
do
in
the
house,
which
we
know
from
the
fact
that
he
said
it.
now,
i
can't
find
anything
in
that
legislative
history
that
supports
the
statement
that
you
made
on
page
21,
that
this
initially
was
meant
to
refer
only
to
people
under
federal
sentence
of
death.
