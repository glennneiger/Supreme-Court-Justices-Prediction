ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
a
logical
reading
of
the
statute's
plain
language,
and
section
3599(a)(
2)
that's
printed
on
page
1
of
the
blue
brief
provides
that
when
a
state
death
row
inmate
seeks
2254
relief,
he
shall
be
represented
by
counsel.
he
shall
be
appointed
counsel
by
the
federal
court.
and
that
representation
is
governed
by
subsection
(e).
subsection
(e)
that
is
on
page
2a
of
our
blue
brief
defines
the
scope
of
counsel's
representation
and
also
divides
that
representation
by
two
clauses
that
begin
with
the
word
"shall".
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
second
(e).
and
that
clause
says
that
counsel
shall
also
represent
the
defendant
in
proceedings
for
executive
or
other
clemency
as
may
be
available
to
him.
and
we
know
that
this
means
state
clemency
proceedings
because
of
the
words
"available"
and
the
words
"or
other".
for
a
2254
petitioner
or
defendant
like
mr.
harbison,
the
only
type
of
clemency
that
is
available
to
him
is
state
clemency,
and
in
order
to
give
effect
to
the
words
"or
other"
that
were
used
by
congress,
we
know
that
that
must
refer
to
state
clemency
because
the
only
type
of
clemency
that
the
federal
government
provides
is
executive
clemency.
now,
not
only
is
the
interpretation
of
this
statute
controlled
by
the
plain
language,
but
this
interpretation
makes
sense
because
--
and
it
makes
sense
that
congress
would
provide
for
continuous
representation
for
capital
defendants
in
that
it
fills
a
need,
a
gap
in
representation;
it's
efficient;
and
it
also
helps
to
improve
the
reliability
of
the
death
penalty
as
it's
administered
in
this
country.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
no,
your
honor.
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
structure
of
subsection
(e).
and
i
believe
your
question
would
go
to
the
very
first
3
of
subsection
(e),
and
that
would
--
in
that
counsel
that
is
appointed
under
(a)(
2)
"shall
represent
the
defendant
in
subsequent
stages
of
judicial
proceedings.
"
and
for
the
(a)(
2)
lawyer,
the
lawyer
appointed
under
subsection
(a)(
2),
that
stage
of
proceeding
that
the
representation
begins
with
is
described
in
(e)
as
"all
available
post-conviction
process".
and
then
it
goes
on
for
the
remainder
of
the
statute,
together
with
the
applications--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--right.
it
begins
at
the
(e).
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
no,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
the
habeas
attorney,
the
representation
would
begin
with
the
"all
available
post-conviction
process".
if
that
attorney
did
obtain
relief
for
the
defendant
or
the
federal
court
granted
relief
for
the
capital
defendant
and
that
case
were
to
return
to
state
court,
then
of
course
we're
not
talking
about
continued
representation
of
the
federal
habeas
counsel
because--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--well,
because,
your
honor--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--your
honor,
the
retrial
and
the
trial
proceedings
that's
referred
to
in
subsection
(e),
those
are
duties
of
counsel
appointed
under
(a)(
1)
of
the
statute,
which
is
on
page
1a,
which
would
be
trial
counsel
for
those
defendants
charged
with
a
federal
capital
crime.
we
would
not
--
a
habeas
lawyer
would
not
participate
in
a
retrial
because
--
for
a
few
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
because
of
the
statute
and
the
structure
of
the
statute,
which
sets
out
the
ordinary
course
of
the
capital
case,
so
that
there's
nothing
subsequent,
no
duties
listed
here
that
are
a
subsequent
stage
for
habeas
counsel.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
it's
in
context
with
the
whole
of
the
statute.
with
respect,
we
look
at
(a)(
1)
and
(a)(
2)
for
that
context
for
subsection
(e).
so
subsection--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
looking
at
the
context
of
the
whole
statute
is
in
accordance
with
also
looking
at
the
plain
language
used
by
congress.
and
we
do
look
at
--
at
the
statute
as
a
whole
in
order
to
inform
our
definition--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--yes.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
yes--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
"in
all
subsequent
stages
of
judicial
proceedings.
"
is
exactly
what
subsection
(e)
states.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
respectfully,
your
honor,
the
state
retrial
would
be
an
entirely
new
case
that
would
not
fall
under
"all
available
post-conviction
process".
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
your
honor,
2254
or
2255
proceeding.
now,
the
--
together
with
appropriate
applications
for
stays
and
appropriate
motions
and
procedures.
now,
that
is
a
part
of
this
first
clause
in
subsection
(e)
that,
under
appropriate
circumstances,
may
permit
the
federally
appointed
lawyer
to
return
to
state
court
if
deemed
appropriate
by
the
federal
court.
if
the
federal
court
found
that
an
issue
in
the
federal
habeas
case
needed
to
be
exhausted
in
order
to
aid
that
judge's
determination
of
the
habeas
petition,
then
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
federal
judge
to
say:
counsel,
please
return
to
state
court
and
exhaust
this
issue.
however--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--well,
your
honor,
again
the
key
here
is
that
congress
used
the
word
"appropriate",
and
that's
an
easy
legal
standard
for
the
federal
judge
to
determine.
there
--
the
statute
does
not
say
state
postconviction
process
or
a
state
post-conviction
case.
it
indicates
appropriate
motion
or
procedures.
so
that
would
be
for
the
federal
judge--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--yes,
your
honor,
and
--
and
i
would
submit
that
that
is
a
reference
to
--
if
we
look
at
(a)(
2)
--
excuse
me
--
where
it
says,
the
very
first
line,
post-conviction
proceeding
under
2254
and
'55
--
so
that
describes
--
all
available
post-conviction
process
describes
the
2254
or
2255
proceedings.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
no,
your
honor,
not
just
by
a
plain
definition
of
that.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
yes.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
yes.
well,
that's
the
key,
"subsequent
stage".
and
--
and
a
retrial
would
not
be
a
subsequent
stage.
that
would
be
an
entirely
new
case
back
in
the
state
court.
and
there's
also
a
second
reason
why
federal
habeas
counsel
would
not
represent
the
defendant
in
any
retrial
or
resentencing,
and
that
would
be--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
well,
under
the
--
the
structure
of
the
statute,
there's
nothing
subsequent--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--okay.
well,
there
is
another
reason
why
federal
habeas
counsel
would
not
do
a
state
retrial,
and
that's
because
under
(a)(
2),
the
--
the
clause
or
the
part
of
the
statute
that
does
provide
for
the
appointment
of
counsel,
if
there
is
already
counsel
available,
then
that
appointment
clause
would
not
be
triggered.
if
we
look
at
(a)(
2),
which
is
on
page
1a,
the
trigger
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
is
that
we
have
an
indigent
defendant.
it
says
a
defendant
who
is
--
this
is
four
lines
down
--
a
defendant
who
is
or
becomes
financially
unable
to
obtain
adequate
representation
shall
be
appointed
a
lawyer.
in
a
retrial,
the
state
must
provide
trial
counsel--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--yes.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
yes--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
--
that
these
circumstances
that
trigger
the
appointment
do
carry
through
the
appointment
process
in
that
even
if
you
look
at
the
language
used
by
congress,
it
says
"any
defendant
who
is
or
becomes
financially
unable.
"
so
congress
was
anticipating--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--yes,
your
honor,
then
we
would
be
looking
again
at
the
first
clause
of
subsection
(e),
and
we
would
be
looking
at
the
language
used
by
congress,
"any
appropriate
motions
and
procedures".
and
again,
appropriateness
is
a
easy
legal
standard
applied
by
the
courts.
the
federal
judge
overseeing
the
case
could
determine
whether
--
whether
returning
for
that
state
post-conviction
process
is
appropriate.
it
would
be
just
like
a
federal
judge
determining
that
in
order
to
aid
its
decision-making
process,
it
needs
to
certify
a
question
back
to
the
state
court.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
your
honor,
"appropriate"--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--yes,
and
then
it
describes
those
stages.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
and
then
we
are
at
four
lines
up
from
the
bottom.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
i'm
sorry.
five
lines
up
from
the
bottom.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
"and
other
appropriate"--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--"motions".
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
your
honor--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--yes,
sir.
well,
your
honor,
that
is--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--your
honor,
if
we
were
looking
at
the
possibility
of
exhausting
a
claim
in
state
court,
then
we
wouldn't
be
--
none
of
this
first
part
of
--
of
(e)
would
apply.
that
wouldn't
be
a
pretrial
proceeding.
that
wouldn't
be
a
trial.
that
wouldn't
be
a
sentencing.
what
that
would
come
under
would
be
after
"and
all
available
post-conviction
process",
that
would
be
described
as
"other
appropriate
motions
and
procedures".
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
the
habeas
proceeding.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
well,
because,
your
honor,
congress
doesn't
use
the
word
"federal"
here,
and
if
we
were
to
interpret
it
as--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--well,
that's
correct,
your
honor;
however,
when
we
look
at
post-conviction
process
in
(e),
we
have
the
context
of
(a)(
2),
that
talks
about
postconviction
proceeding
under
section
2254
and
2255.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
well,
your
honor
--
and
that's
true.
the
interpretation
of
this
first
clause
of
subsection
(e)
doesn't
impact
the
second
--
the
interpretation
of
the
second
clause.
it
says
specifically
counsel
shall
represent
the
defendant
in
those
clemency
proceedings
that
are
available
to
him.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
respectfully,
your
honor,
i
would
disagree,
and
--
and
that's
because
the
words
are
different,
used
by
congress.
congress
is
very
explicit
in
stating
other
clemency
as
may
be
available
to
the
defendant.
there's
no
way
that
that
can
be
interpreted
as
federal
clemency.
there
is
no
other
federal
clemency;
there's
only
executive--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--no,
and
for
two
reasons.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
your
honor,
i
don't
have
to.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
your
honor,
that
is
my
position.
however,
of
course,
again,
the
interpretation
of
this
first
part
of
this
statute
is
separate
from
an
interpretation
of
the
clemency
clause.
but
for
two
reasons
the
answer
would
be
no
to
that
question,
because
the
statute
--
number
one,
(e)
does
not
specifically
set
that
out
as
a
subsequent
stage
of
judicial
proceedings.
okay?
what
it
does
instead
is
it
states
appropriate
motions
or
procedures.
so
it
would
be
discretionary.
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
the
district
judge
could
determine
whether
he
believed
it
was
appropriate,
non-abusive,
to
return
to
state
court
to
exhaust
a
claim.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
not
with
respect
to
subsection
(e).
and
ordinarily
an
exhaustion
proceeding
is
not
a
subsequent
stage.
ordinarily,
if
that's
what
the
--
the
statute
contemplates,
is
the
ordinary
course--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
the
very
beginning
of
(e)
indicates
"each
attorney
so
appointed
shall
represent
the
defendant
throughout
every
subsequent
stage
of
available
judicial
proceedings,
including.
"
--and
then
it
recites
all
of
those
stages.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
if
i
wasn't
clear.
it
may
include.
it
does
not
require.
it
may
include
going
back
to
state
court
to
exhaust.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
because,
your
honor,
we're
--
when
we're
talking
about
an
exhaustion
proceeding
or
returning
to
state
court,
it
can
only
fit
under
this
part
of
(e)
that
says
that
it
would
be
an
appropriate
motion
or
procedure.
that's
the
only
thing
that
you
could
define
a
state
proceeding
under
in
this
--
in
this
statute.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
and
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
i
think
also,
if
we
look
at
the
representation
as
it
does
occur
in
the
real
world,
we
have
the
aedpa,
we
have
this
court's
decisions
that
--
that
structure
the
--
the
capital
litigation
so
that
state
court
exhaustion
normally
comes
before
the
federal
habeas
process.
but,
again,
there
are
these
two
separate
clauses.
the
first
goes
to
judicial
proceedings;
the
second
clause
goes
to
--
to
nonjudicial
proceedings,
including
competency,
because
this
court
in
ford
v.
wainwright
indicated
that
we
need
not
have
a
judicial
proceeding,
a
judicial
determination
of
competency.
so
congress
has
separated
out
competency
and
separated
out
clemency,
knowing
that
--
that
those
are
stages
of
a
capital
case
that
come
at
the
very
end
of
the
federal
habeas,
that
the
federal
habeas
counsel
would
be
in
the
best
position
to
represent
that
defendant--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--your
honor,
competency
and
clemency
are
in
their
own
"shall"
clause,
mandatory
clause,
in
and
of
themselves.
they're
not
included
in
the
--
the
post-conviction
process.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
the
post-conviction
process
would
refer
to
anything
in
the
2254,
the
2255.
for
example,
it
--
it
could
be
the
discovery
motions;
it
could
be
--
it
could
be
motions
in
aid
of
an
evidentiary
hearing;
it
could
be
motions
in
aid
of
an
appeal.
so
that
--
that's
a
descriptor.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
your
honor,
that
is
it
my
reading
of
--
of
2254,
2255.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
congress
contemplated
that,
and
that's
why
i
think
they
included
this
language
"appropriate
motions
and
procedures"
to
encompass
a
return
to
state
court
where--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--it's
four
lines
up
from
the
--
or
five
lines
up
from
the
--
the
bottom,
the
end
of
that
line
--
"appropriate"--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--that's
in
the
first
"subsequent
stage"
clause.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
your
honor,
it
may.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
it
may.
however,
in
our
--
my
reading
of
the
statute,
when
we
look
at
the
subsequent
stage,
exhaustion
ordinarily
comes
before
federal
habeas.
it
would
be,
you
know,
an
unordinary
situation
where
you
would
have
to
go
back
and
exhaust.
but
i
believe
that
the
statute
contemplates
that
with
"appropriate
motions
and
procedures".
but
of
course,
congress
could
have
contemplated
that
the
federal
lawyer
continue
to
represent
the
defendant
in
exhaustion
proceedings.
back
when
the
statute
was
--
was
created,
congress
was
looking
at
the
states
and
looking
at
the
fact
that
states
were
not
providing
counsel
for
capital
defendants
in
these
cases.
and
congress--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
that
it
wasn't
mandatory.
it
doesn't
require.
what
is
says
is
appropriate--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--yes.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
absolutely,
your
honor.
just
like
this
court
in
rhines
v.
weber
said,
it's
discretionary
as
to
whether
this
--
as
to
whether
the
federal
judge
is
going
to
determine
that
we
are
going
to
hold
this
case
in
abeyance.
we're
going
to
stay
this
case
while
we
--
while
counsel
goes
back
to
exhaust
some
claims.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
correct.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
it
does,
your
honor.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
no,
your
honor.
for--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--well,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
in
(a)(
1),
we
would
--
we
--
because
(a)(
1)
sets
out
the
factors
that
trigger
the
appointment
of
counsel,
we
have
to
have
a
defendant
who's
charged
with
a
capital
crime,
who's
indigent,
and
who
otherwise
doesn't
have
a
lawyer.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
that's
correct.
but,
your
honor,
for
a
state
capital
trial,
for
a
state
capital
direct
appeal,
the
states
do
provide
counsel,
and
congress
would
know
that
that
states
would
have
to
provide
counsel
under--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--your
honor,
certainly
last
clause
of
(e)
is
unqualified
and
unambiguous;
however,
(a)(
1),
there
is
a
qualifier
in
that
it
says
"unable
to
obtain
adequate
representation".
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
if
--
if
a
state
provides
representation,
then
you
don't
have
a
federally
appointed
counsel.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
your
honor,
i
think
this
court
would
have
problems
under
gideon--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--if
the
states
do
not--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--well--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--well,
your
honor,
again,
the
answer
to
that
question
under
(a)(
1)
is
that
you
would
not
get
federally
appointed
counsel
when
you
have
counsel
available
to
you
otherwise.
and
--
and
that
simply
is
the
fact
that
the
--
the
states
do
provide
for
counsel.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
well,
your
honor--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--that
--
that
is--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--that
is
part
of
(a)(
1),
and
it's
part
of
(a)(
2).
however,
you
still
have
to
have
--
you
still
have
to
have
those
--
those
three
circumstances
present.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
and
i
believe
that
that
--
that
still
would
not
--
the
states,
if
they
provide
any
sort
of
resources
at
all,
and
if
they
provide
a
lawyer,
then
certainly
the
trigger
for
appointment
isn't
--
isn't
available
under
(a)(
1).
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
your
honor,
it's
the
constitution
that
determines
the
--
the
federal
authority
for
clemency.
so
congress
cannot
effect
that.
the
--
the
only
type
of
clemency--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--no,
your
honor,
it
does
not
say
that.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
well,
your
honor,
if--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--your
honor--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--your
honor,
these
are
the
words
that
congress
used.
they
know
that
the
--
that
the
states
provide
for
forms
of
clemency
other
than
executive
clemency.
we
know
that
--
that
congress
specifically
stated
they
wanted
the
defendant
to
be
represented
in
that
clemency
proceeding
that's
available
to
him.
and
in
--
in
these
cases,
like
this
2254
case--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
your
honor--
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
--the
--
the
language
of
the
statute
is
the
best
intent
of
congress.
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
have
any
time
remaining,
i'd
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
word
(e)
is
given
meaning
by
congress
by
the
words
that
congress
used,
and
when
it
says
"proceedings
for
clemency",
it
means
proceedings
for
that
clemency
that's
available
to
the
defendant.
subsection
(a)(
2)
put
2254
defendants
and
2255
defendants
on
the
same
footing,
and
if
we
don't
give
effect
to
the
"or
other"
language
or
the
"available"
language
in
the
clemency
clause,
then
we're
rendering
those
words
meaningless.
we're
--
and
we're
saying
that
--
that
congress
somehow
sub
silentio
read
out
2254
defendants
from
the
clemency
clause.
in
addition,
your
honor,
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
that
giving
a
lawyer
for
an
--
giving
an
attorney
for
a
person
on
death
row
to
present
a
case
for
clemency
before
the
clemency
decisionmaker
is
not
an
intrusion
on
the
states.
if
it
were,
we
would
see
the
states
lined
up
here
in
opposition
to
our
interpretation
of
the
case,
and
they
have
not
done
that.
in
particular
in
this
case,
the
state
of
tennessee
takes
no
position,
and
at
least
four
other
times
this
--
this
statute
has
been
litigated.
other
death
penalty
states
have
taken
no
position.
so
there
simply
is
no
intrusion
in
--
in
providing
a
person
a
lawyer,
and
we
have
heard
from
11
governors
representing
7
other
death
penalty
states
that
say
it's
very
important
for
them
to
be
fully
informed
when
they
make
this
life-or-death
decision
when
they're
presented
with
these
capital
clemency
petitions.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
your
honor,
clemency
has
been
granted
one
time
since
furman
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor.
ms.
dana
c.
hansen
chavis
that
would
be
the
last
20
or
30,
your
honor.
we've
just
recently
started
having
executions.
if
i
--
if
i
may
just
add
one
other
factor
your
honor.
clemency
was
granted
four
times
in
2008
throughout
the
country.
