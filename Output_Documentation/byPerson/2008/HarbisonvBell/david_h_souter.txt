well,
i
understand
that,
but
it's
still
executive
clemency.
justice
david
h.
souter
when
--
when
the
--
when
the
clemency
decision
is
made,
it's
not
being
made
by
these
other
people
who
are
helping
out
the
president.
it's
--
it's
being
made
by
the
executive.
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
it
would
have
made
sense
for
congress
to
use
"other"
as
a
way
of
referring
to
the
states
simply
because
it
would
have
been
a
matter
of
indifference
to
congress
whether
a
state
process
was
executive
or
was
other
in
some
way,
in
effect
just
leaving
the
issue
open
as
--
as
an
irrelevance.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
that
--
that
still
leaves
you
with
the
question
that
the
--
what
the
--
what
the
words
"or
other"
can
possibly
refer
to,
given
the
present
state
of
federal
law,
federal
constitutional
law,
unless
they
refer
to
state
proceedings.
