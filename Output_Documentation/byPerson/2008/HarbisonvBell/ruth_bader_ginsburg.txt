but
you
are
including
then.
suppose
that
the
result
of
the
federal
habeas
is
that
the
state
--
relief
is
granted
unless
the
state
retries
the
defendant
in
x
number
of
days.
and
your
reading,
i
think
that
the
--
the
appointed
counsel
on
the
federal
habeas
would
be
responsible
for
representation
in
all
available
post-conviction
process,
and
that
would
be
an
available
post-conviction
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would?
then,
tell
me
what
would
fall
under
"all
available
post-conviction
process"
in
--
in
addition
to
clemency
and
competency
proceedings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
let's
go
back
to
the
earlier
question.
so
what
else
fits
under
"all
available
post-conviction
process"
other
than
competency
and
clemency?
what
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
so
but
what
--
what
would
be
included?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
all
this
is
dependent
upon
the
defendant
showing
that
he
is
financially
unable
to
obtained
adequate
representation.
and
if
he
is
in
the
state
court,
then
that's
the
answer
to
it.
it's
the
only
when
he
isn't.
and
i
thought
in
the
clemency
cases,
particularly,
there
was
no
funds
in
state
court.
