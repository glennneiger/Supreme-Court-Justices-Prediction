justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
a
subsequent
--
a
subsequent
stage
of
available
judicial
proceedings,
his
retrial
in
state
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
have
lost
you.
where
--
where
is
the
"appropriate"?
i
don't
see
any
"appropriate".
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says,
"shall
represent
the
defendant
throughout
every
--
every
subsequent
stage
of
available
judicial
proceedings.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
"and
all"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
"other
appropriate",
but
as
far
as
what's
covered
by
the
first
clause
is
concerned,
"appropriate"
doesn't
apply
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
represent
throughout
every
subsequent
stage
of
available
proceedings,
including
pretrial,
trial,
sentencing,
motions
for
a
new
trial,
appeals,
applications
for
writ
of
certiorari.
there
is
no
"appropriate"
with
any
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
shall
also
represent
--
"and
other
appropriate
motions
and
procedures.
"
but
that
doesn't
cover
the
earlier
stuff.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
--
but,
you
know,
it
--
it
mentions
trial
proceedings,
trial,
sentencing,
motions
for
new
trial,
appeals,
applications
for
writ
of
cert.
and
then
in
the
next
clause,
it
just
says,
"and
all
available
post-conviction
process".
now,
you
--
you
would
acknowledge
that
--
that
going
back
to
exhaust
claims
that
hadn't
been
exhausted
before
the
state
courts
would
be
post-conviction
process
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
"subsequent
stage"
does
not
apply
to
this
clause.
i'm
reading
the
clause
"and
all
available
post-conviction
process".
justice
antonin
scalia
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
chavis,
what
do
you
do
about(a)(
1)?
that
also
does
not
--
is
not
limited
by
its
terms--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
federal
prisoners.
would
you
argue
that
--
it
says,
"in
every
criminal
action
in
which
a
defendant
is
charged
with
a
crime
which
may
be
punishable
by
death.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
"a
defendant
who
is
or
becomes
financially.
"
--so
even
in
the
original
state
trial,
he's
entitled
to
a
federal
defendant.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
it
doesn't
--
it
isn't
limited
to
federal
trials.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
it
says
he
"shall
be
entitled
to
the
appointment
of
one
or
more
attorneys.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what?
i
mean,
it
--
it
still
is
--
is
unqualified.
and
--
and
part
of
your
argument
--
it's
not
your
only
argument,
but
a
large
part
of
your
argument
is
since
it
is
unqualified
in
--
in
(e),
the
last
clause,
it
has
to
include
state.
well,
you
could
say
the
same
about
(a)(
1).
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
--
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
so
if
the
state
doesn't
provide
counsel,
the
federal
government
will
provide
it,
and
the
states
can
--
can
recede
from
their
obligation
to
provide
counsel.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
so
long
as
he
has
counsel,
we
don't
care
who
pays
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
about
expert
services?
i
think
most
states
don't
provide
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
federal
government
will
provide
expert
--
compensation
for
the
use
of
experts
when
the
states
won't?
justice
antonin
scalia
under
(a)(
1).
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
--
it
seems
to
me,
counsel,
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
doesn't
mention
federal
explicitly
is
--
is
not
a
very
strong
argument
unless
you're
going
to
take
the
position
that
even
(a)(
1)
applies
to
federal
and
state.
and
--
and
really
what
you're
--
the
only
strong
string
to
your
bow
is
that
it
says
"executive
or
other
clemency".
and
--
and
there
--
there
seems
to
be
no
federal
clemency
except
executive
clemency,
i
guess.
i
guess.
can
congress
declare
something
that
has
been
a
crime
no
longer
a
crime
and
set
the
guy
loose?
i
don't
know.
is
that
clemency?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
says
--
it
says
the
president
can.
it
doesn't
say
congress
can't.
does
it
say
congress
can't?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
know
that
they
read
this
text
carefully
before
they
voted
for
it.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
know
any
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
are
all
assumptions.
that's
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
this
was
a
federal
law.
is
this
a
conyers
law?
is
that
what
it
is
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
his
colleagues
know
what
he
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
should
the
constitution
be
amended,
it
would
cover
that.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.
jay,
i
--
i
assume
that
(a)(
1),
which
provides
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
conduct
the
trial
in
a
--
in
a
capital
case,
would
not
have
very
much
application
either,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
only
in
federal
capital
cases,
of
which
there
are
very,
very
few.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
sure.
you
could
--
you
could
put
all
your
weight
on
the
"other"
--
"executive
or
other"
--
and
you
could
say
that's
the
only
provision
where
it's
apparently
clear
from
the
text
that
--
that
state
proceedings
were
included.
assuming
you
are
wrong,
that
there
are
non-executive
state
clemency
proceedings
--
you
are
sure
that
there
aren't?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what
do
you
mean
by
the
federal-state
balance?
because
this
is
funding
somebody
to
argue
against
the
interests
of
the
states,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
assuming
the
state
has
convicted
somebody,
you
are
arguing
against
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
federal
government
is
funding
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
government's
position,
that
under
this
provision,
even
if
--
even
if
state
funding
--
well,
you
say
state
isn't
covered
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
assuming
state
funding
is
covered,
assuming
representation
in
the
state
is
covered,
it
does
seem
to
be
the
case
that
the
test
of
whether
you
get
some
--
some
federal
lawyer
appointed
is
not
whether
you
don't
have
a
state
lawyer,
but
rather
whether
you
can
pay
for
counsel.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
strange.
