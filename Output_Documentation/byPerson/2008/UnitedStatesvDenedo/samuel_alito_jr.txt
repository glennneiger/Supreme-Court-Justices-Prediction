justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
that
mean
that
your
--
your
argument
boils
down
to
the
proposition
that
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
ucmj
were
intended
to
eliminate
coram
nobis,
or
is
there
more
to
your
argument
than
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
well,
that
--
then
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
your
argument.
maybe
you
can
explain
why
you
--
you
contend
that
if
the
respondent
had
been
convicted
in
a
federal
district
court
and
everything
else
was
the
same,
he
would
be
able
to
petition
for
a
writ
of
coram
nobis,
but
he
can't
in
the
military
courts.
what
is
the
basis
for
that?
both
a
federal
district
court
--
a
federal
district
court
is
a
creature
of
statute.
it
has
the
jurisdiction
that
congress
gives
it
and
no
greater
jurisdiction.
it
has
certain
--
what's
been
termed
inherent
authority.
the
all
writs
act
applies
to
it.
all
of
those
things
are
true
of
the
military
courts
as
well.
so
what
is
the
basis
for
the
distinction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well
--
well,
that,
as
i
understand,
was
the
argument
i
started
out
with,
that
the
--
your
argument
is
that
the
ucmj
was
intended
to
eliminate
coram
nobis
if
it
had
been
previously
available.
that's
your
--
that's
the
argument
you're
making
now?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
difference
on
the
face
--
on
their
face
between
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
ucmj
and
the
provisions
that
govern
the
ability
of
a
criminal
defendant
in
federal
district
court
to
get
relief
after
being
convicted?
the
--
there
are
limited
avenues
that
are
provided
under
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
under
the
statutes--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--just
as
there
are
in
the
ucmj.
what
--
what
is
the
difference?
