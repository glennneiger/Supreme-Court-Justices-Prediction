justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
--
suppose
that
the
problem
was
a
professional
soldier
convicted
a
certain
number
of
years
ago
of
a
particular
crime,
a
few
years
later,
through
some
amazing
mistake,
they
wrote
the
wrong
number
down.
the
clerk
just
wrote
the
wrong
number
of
the
code
provision.
that's
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
made
it
a
felony
instead.
it
was
actually
a
misdemeanor.
what's
he
supposed
to
do?
i
mean,
normally
you
go
back
to
the
court
and
say:
judge,
you
know,
they
just
made
--
everyone
admits
it's
a
simple
transcribing
error.
would
you
please
correct
it?
now,
how
--
how
is
that
supposed
to
work
in
the
military?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
no,
he's
--
he's
finished
his
sentence.
this
is
several
years
ago.
they
just
now
discovered
it,
and
it
could
affect
him
in
the
future
that
it
happened
in
fact
to
be
a
misdemeanor
he
was
convicted
of.
but
the
--
the
code
section
they
wrote
down
is
a
felony.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
yes,
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
this
is
7
years.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
can't
even
do
that.
so
nobody
in
the
military,
in
fact,
once
their
thing
is
final
--
then
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
in
your
view,
that
he
has
left
the
military?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
--
you're
saying,
whether
you're
in
the
military,
whether
you're
out
of
the
military,
no
matter
how
egregious,
no
matter
how
obvious,
there
is
no
route
for
a
military
person,
a
professional,
to
go
and
get
an
obvious
error
corrected.
if
--
if
he
has
missed
the
statute,
that
there
was
an
--
the
civil
statute
of
limitations,
it's
hard
for
him
to
go
to
the
tucker
act.
he's
been
in
the
philippines
the
entire
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
it
happened.
it
really
happened.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
suggest
that
i
think
you
--
i
can't
quite
decide
what
stool
you
want
to
rest
on.
part
of
this
you
say,
well,
he's
a
civilian
that
has
left
the
military.
and
then
i
read
that.
it
seems
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
but
your
other
argument
seems
to
be
that
doesn't
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
military
soldier
can
correct
an
error,
no
matter
how
egregious,
even
a
technical
--
you
know,
they
just
wrote
the
wrong
thing
down
--
because
congress
didn't
want
them
to.
now,
i
doubt
that
congress
thought
about
that.
i'm
just
not
sure
they
didn't
want
them
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
that's
so,
then
i
guess
you
can
have
courts
reviewing
the
civilians.
they
will
review
after
the
event
the
court-martial
jurisdiction
--
the
court-martials
of
people
while
they
were
in
the
military.
that
will
become
a
matter
of
course
anytime.
i
mean,
there
are
many,
many
errors.
we
have
approximately
5,000
petitions
a
year
claiming
some
kind
of
constitutional
error,
and
sometime
they're
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
what
you
foresee?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
way
is
it
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
--
in
other
words,
in
the
case
i
posed,
he
would
--
he
--
in
your
view,
he
wouldn't
have
any
remedy.
you
would
agree
with
the
government
about
that,
if
it's
7
years
later
you
find
a
clerical
error?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if,
in
fact,
you're
waiting
until
the
--
the
civil
courts
have
lost
all
jurisdiction
because
the
statute
of
limitations
has
expired,
why
do
you
need
this?
why
can't
they
just
go
--
i
mean,
why
do
you
need
this
special
thing
that
hasn't
existed
for
200
years?
why
don't
they
just
go
to
a
civil
case?
and
moreover,
why
doesn't
your
client
fall
within
that
situation?
you're
claiming
that
if
all
the
statutes
have
run
and
everything,
there
is
no
coram
nobis
jurisdiction,
i
thought
in
your
case
they
had
all
run.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you're
saying
that
what
you're
foreseeing
is
through
coram
nobis,
indefinitely,
a
person
outside
the
military
who
once
was
in
it
can
bring
constitutional
challenges?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
okay,
and
we
see
those
every
day,
don't
we?
but
there
is
one
difference.
the
difference
is
that
often,
though
not
always,
a
person
in
habeas
who
challenges
a
prior
normal,
civil
system
conviction,
the
state
can
retry
him.
and
i
guess,
in
the
instance
that
we're
talking
about,
he
can
never
be
retried.
so
in
fact
the
difference
would
be,
in
your
view,
the
civilians
who
bring
this
would
never
be
retried
if
they're
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
they
would
have
in
that
sense
greater
protection
in
the
military
system
than
in
the
ordinary
criminal
courts
a
person
has
in
habeas,
because
the
option
of
retrial
is
often
but
not
always
there.
now,
why
would
congress
have
intended
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
you
have
a
good
answer
to
what
my
question
was.
i
thought
that
was
a
good
answer.
it's
helping
me.
and
--
but
where
i'm
--
where
i'm
slightly
--
and
maybe
this
is
just
not
relevant
to
this
case
or
maybe
it's
for
the
future.
coram
nobis,
i
thought,
was
a
writ
that
means
really
like
technical
clerical
errors
or
something
really
unusual.
is
this
--
i
mean,
it's
hardly
ever
there.
i've
not
really
seen
more
than
a
handful
of
cases.
so
--
so
is
this
writ
supposed
to
be
available
for
what
you're
claiming
is
what
i
call
a
typical
error
of
inadequate
representation?
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
i
think
it's
--
maybe
you
could
say
that's
not
presented.
maybe
that's
for
a
later
case.
i
don't
know
how
to
treat
it.
that's
why
i'm
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
knew
it
wasn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
it
might
be
your
answer:
well,
that
isn't
raised.
and
that
would
be
a
perfectly
good
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
telling
you
my
honest
problem
which
i'm
trying
to
think
through:
where
are
we
going
with
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
going
to
happen
one
way
or
the
other
way?
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
so
all
i'm
asking
is
your
best
thought
on
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
theory
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
military
court
in
the
circumstance
where
the
individual
is
still
in
the
military,
he's
been
convicted,
and
he
is
in
custody?
so
he
wants
to
get
out
of
custody.
now,
what's
the
theory
of
that?
he
can
--
i
take
it
it's
accepted,
is
it,
that
they
can
--
that
such
a
person
can
ask
the
military
justice
system
--
i
don't
know
which
court
--
for
release
on
the
ground
that
he
didn't
--
wasn't
adequately
represented
or
some
other
ground?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
it's
a
habeas
case.
now,
do
you
have
--
can
you
do
that
in
the
military?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what's
the
theory
of
the
jurisdiction
that
the
military
courts
have
over
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
aiding
what
jurisdiction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they've
already
directly
reviewed
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there
is
no
more
direct
review
to
be
had.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
does
this
aid
the
direct
review
that
is
to
be
had,
since
there
is
none?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
