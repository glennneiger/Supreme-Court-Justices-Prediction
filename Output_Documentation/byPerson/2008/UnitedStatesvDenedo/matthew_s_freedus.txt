mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
because
there
are
courts,
appellate
military
courts
must
have
coram
nobis
power
to
protect
the
integrity
of
their
judgments.
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
asserted
the
same
coram
nobis
power
that
article
iii
courts
have.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
they
were
given
the
all
writs
act
authority
as
a
birth
right
in
1950,
and
that
includes
all
prerogative
writs,
including
coram
nobis.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
and
also,
your
honor,
they
must
have
the
ability
to
protect
the
integrity
of
their
judgments
just
like
other
federal
courts
have.
the
superior
court
in
d.c.
has
the
power
to
issue
coram
nobis
to
protect
its
judgments.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
i
think
congress
has
the
authority
to
legislate
very
broadly
in
the
area
of
collateral
remedies,
and
congress
could
take
away
the
writ
of
coram
nobis
if
it
left
in
its
place
an
adequate
and
effective
substitute,
like
it
did
in
2255.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
our
view
is
that
if--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--no,
your
honor.
we
believe
there
has
to
be
reasonable
opportunity
to
bring
a
colorable
constitutional
claim
for
which
there
is
no
other
avenue
of
relief,
which
we
believe
is
the
case
here.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
the
best
authority
we
have
for
that,
your
honor,
is
webster
v.
doe,
which
we
believe
stands
for
the
proposition
that
courts
should
read
statutes
so
as
not
to
preclude
judicial
review
of
a
constitutional
claim
absent
an
express
congressional
intent
to
do
so--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--i
think
--
well,
if
i
could
make
two
points,
your
honor.
on
the
first,
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
square
authority
for
the
bedrock
constitutional
proposition
that
congress
can
wipe
away
all
avenues
of
relief
for
a
claim.
we
believe
that
we
were--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--correct.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
we
would
--
i
think
we
are--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--yes.
i
would
like
to
--
yes,
your
honor,
it
has
been
used
since
1966.
i
assume
you
may
be
asking
about
before
1950.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
yes.
well,
the
reason
it
hasn't
happened
before
1950
is
that
the
ucmj
was
created
in
1950,
and
that
was
the
first
time
there
were
military
courts.
there
were
no
courts,
so
therefore
no
all
writs
act
authority
prior
to
1950.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
absolutely.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
that
was
--
i
think
that's
the
impetus
behind
the
ucmj,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
not
--
no,
not
--
we
aren't,
your
honor.
i
was
more
responding
to
the
chief
justice's--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
i
think,
your
honor,
that's
the
best
answer
that
i
should
have
given.
[laughter]
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
we
don't
have
square
authority
from
this
court
to
support
that
proposition.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
where
--
we're
comfortably
in
that
neck
of
the
woods,
and
we
really
don't
need
to
get
closer
to
the
scarier
question
that
was
alluded
to.
so
we--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
it
does
it
in
a
very
similar
way
that
this
court
explained
in
the
united
states
v.
morgan,
and
that
is
the
writ
of
coram
nobis
aids
the
past
appellate
jurisdiction
that
the
navy
court
had
when
it
affirmed
and
reviewed
mr.
denedo's
conviction.
it
had
jurisdiction
there.
and
the
coram
nobis
writ
by
its
very
nature
allows
a
court
to
correct
an
error
in
a
case
that
was
before
it,
but
it
failed
to
perceive
that
error
while
it
had
the
case
before
it.
and
had
it
known
the
facts
we
now
know
after
all
of
the
remedies
are
no
longer
available,
the
court
would
not
have
issued
the
judgment
that
it
issued.
that's
the
--
in
that
sense,
that's
how
the
writ
aids
the
jurisdiction
the
court
had
in
the
past.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
i
would
--
yes
and
no.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
no
is
when
the
individual
is
not
in
custody
and
the
6-year
statute
of
limitations
has
expired
for
all
the
types
of
claims
that
are
available
for
a
collateral
attack
of
a
court-martial
conviction,
a
declaratory
judgment
attack,
a
mandamus
attack,
court
of
federal
claims
attack,
all
those--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--we
agree.
but
we
don't
think
it's
necessary,
actually,
to
decide
the
issue
here.
the
issue
here
really
is
whether
coram
nobis
is
available--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--this
gets
to
the
other
piece
of
the
answer
i
was
trying
to
give,
and
that
is
a
petitioner
from
the
military
system
could
not
file
a
coram
nobis
petition
in
the
article
iii
courts
or
the
court
of
federal
claims
because
there's
no
authority
that
supports
the
proposition
that
you
can
take
a
coram
nobis
petition
and
attack
a
judgment
from
a
different
jurisdiction.
coram
nobis
has
to
allow
the
court
that
issued
--
that
--
that--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--yes,
your
honor,
in
the
military
justice
system.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
i
think
it's
the
very
nature
of
the
coram
nobis
petition,
your
honor,
and
that
is
coram
nobis
petitioners
have
already
served
their
entire
sentence,
so
the
societal
interest
to
seek
a
retrial
is
much
lesser
than
in
the
habeas
case
where
there's
a
lengthy
sentence
less
--
left,
and
if
someone
gets
out
of
jail--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
i
think
there
is
a
classic
distinction
between
the
habeas
and
the
coram
nobis
petitioner.
in
a
coram
nobis
petitioner
under
2255,
if
they
were
to
file
a
successful
petition
long
after
a
statute
of
limitations
had
expired,
they
would
be
in
no
different
position
than
a
coram
nobis
--
a
successful
coram
nobis
petitioner
in
the
military.
we
would
say,
we
do
believe
there's
a
--
a
colorable
argument
for
--
for
the
ability
to
retry
mr.
denedo,
but
it's
not
pivotal
to
our
case.
our
view
is
that
the
inability--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--the
military
courts,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
i
think
morgan
is
helpful
on
that,
your
honor.
morgan
is
a
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel,
and
it's
this
court's--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--well,
the
government
hasn't
urged
that
there's
no
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
it's
not
in
their
opening--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--yes.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
that's
--
that's
why--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--i
think--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
united
states
v.
kwan
and
united
states
v.
castro
are
two
court
--
two
cases
that
give
the
answer
to
your
question
and
both
of
those
indicate
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
in
very
similar
factual
circumstances
to
this,
is
a
basis
for
coram
nobis
relief
after
--
after
the
ineffective
assistance
is
discovered.
we
recognize
this
court
has
granted
in--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--aside
from
this
--
this
case
below,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
of
a
case
that
raised
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
and
you
are
correct
that
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases
are
thrown
out
of
court
in
the
most
--
in
the
briefest
of
orders.
there
are
cases
where
relief
has
been
granted.
they
are
few
and
far
between.
del
prado
is
one.
it
involved
a
compositional
jurisdictional
error
to
the
--
to
the
court.
an
individual
failed
to
elect
a
military
judge
alone
in
writing
and
waived
the
right
to
have
a
--
a
member's
jury
trial,
and
that
was
deemed
a
jurisdictional
defect.
and
long
after
the
case
was
final,
the
--
the
conviction
was
set
aside.
and
i
would
note
the
court
in
that
case
observed
that
personal
jurisdiction
was
no
obstacle
to
granting
the
coram
nobis
relief.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
i
do
not
know.
he
was
--
the
relief
--
the
decretal
paragraph
of
the
--
of
the
decision
indicates
that
he
was
restored
all
rights
and
benefits,
but
it
stops
shy
of
saying,
you
know,
here's
your
uniform
back.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
the
statistics
that
we
cited
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
were
10
coram
nobis
petitions
at
the
court
of
appeals
within
the
last
10
years--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--and
176
writ
appeals
from
the
lower
courts
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
don't
break
out
the
category
of
writs.
they
could
be
habeas,
they
could
be
coram
nobis,
mandamus.
so
we
don't
know
what
percentage
of
the
176.
but
even
if
it
was
a
--
a
significant
percentage,
it's
still
a
tiny
percentage
of
the
court's
overall
docket.
but
they
are
rarer
than
hen's
teeth,
your
honor.
these
cases,
one
a
year
maybe
is
--
would
be
the
average
of
a
coram
nobis--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--that
would
be
a
habeas
case,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
yes.
there
are--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--it's
similar
in
that
it's
all
writs
act
authority
aiding
the--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--a
direct
review
authority
of
the
military--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--correct.
and
that's--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
it
aids
it
in
the
same
way
this
court
recognized
it
can
do
so
in
goldsmith,
where
it
acknowledged
that
a
mandamus
writ
could
issue
after
finality--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--to
compel
adherence
to
the
court's
own
judgment,
so
that--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--yes,
your
honor,
within
the
military
justice
system.
in
that
--
in
goldsmith,
it
was
a
situation
where
goldsmith
was
out
of
the
--
you
know,
out
of
the
military.
he
had
a
final
--
well,
i
guess
he
was
in
custody.
but
he
had
a
final
court-martial
conviction,
and
this
court
indicated
that
a
writ
of
mandamus
could
issue
to
aid
past
appellate
jurisdiction
to
compel
adherence
to
the--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--the
fact--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
he
would
be
a
civilian,
former
service
member--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--filing
a
coram
nobis
petition,
and
the
coram
nobis--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--for
purposes
of
the
coram
nobis
petition.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
they--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--it's
not
a
court-martial,
your
honor.
it's
what's
called
a
dubay
proceeding,
and
what
happens
is
--
and
this
in
the
decretal
paragraph
of
the
--
the
decision
below.
a
remand
is
for
further
factual
development,
and
if
the
case
can
be
disposed
of
on
declarations,
if
the
government
came
forth
--
it
didn't
do
so
below
--
but
if
it
did
so
on
remand
and
provided
affidavits
that
blew
our
affidavits
out
of
the
water,
the
court
could
dismiss
the
petition
out
of
hand.
if
they
couldn't
do
that
or
if
there
was
a
credibility
contest
that
needed
to
be
resolved,
what
would
happen
is
the
court
would
order
what's
called
a
dubay
hearing,
where
a
judge
is
appointed.
and
it's
just
like
an
evidentiary
hearing.
witnesses
are
presented
and
they're
cross-examined,
and
then
findings
of
fact
are
made,
conclusions
of
law
are
drawn.
and
then
that
is
put
into
a
record,
added
to
the
record
of
trial,
and
reviewed
in
the
coram
nobis
petition.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
we
don't
believe
so.
we
believe
the
court
--
the
navy
court
here
has
decisional
authority
under
article
66
to
do
factfinding.
it's
a
very
unique
court.
congress
created
these
courts
with
factfinding
power,
which
is
different
than
i
think
virtually
all
appellate
courts,
save
maybe
one
or
two
unusual
situations.
but
these
courts
have
factfinding
power,
so
it's
right
in
article
66.
and
these
courts
also
have
rulemaking
authority.
and
so
does
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it
has
exercised
that
to
provide
for
these
procedures.
so
we
don't
believe--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--they're
not,
and
actually
that
--
that
--
this
court
pointed
that
out
in
noyd
v.
bond.
it
said
that
military
appellate
courts
have
habeas
power,
but
the
court
of
appeals
hadn't
provided
rules,
and
congress
could
facilitate
with
rules
but
hadn't,
but
that
didn't
stop
this
court
from
saying
habeas
power
existed.
the
absence
of
the
procedure--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
the
negative
in
there
caught
me.
but,
yes,
i
think
that's
what
we're
saying,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
yes,
it
has,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
in
noyd
v.
bond,
this
court
squarely
held
that
military
--
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
time
has
habeas
authority.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
that
was
the
case
where
the
individual
was
pending
appeal,
i
believe.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
well,
i
would
--
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention,
if
i
could,
to
footnote
11
of
goldsmith,
where
this
court
says:
"and
of
course,
once
a
criminal
conviction
has
been
finally
reviewed
within
the
military
system,
and
a
servicemember
in
custody
has
exhausted
other
avenues
provided
under
the
ucmj
to
seek
relief
from
his
conviction.
"
--citing
noyd,
the
six
pages
therein
which
refers
to
the
military
court's
habeas
power.
this
court
in
goldsmith
put
habeas
power
in
the
context
of
a
--
a
final
case,
so
habeas
authority
after
final
relief.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
an
individual
is
out
of
the
military
if
they
--
if
their
dismissal
has
been
executed
--
or
their
discharge
has
been
executed
and
they're
in
leavenworth.
they
could
even
be
moved
to
another
federal
penitentiary
and
still
in
custody.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
so
they're
not
really
in
the
military.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
i
read
it
differently,
your
honor.
i
read
it
--
the
next
clause
in
that
sentence
is
referring
to
habeas
outside.
i
read
this
sentence
as
clearly
saying
that
there's
direct
review.
there's
habeas
after
direct
review
within
the
military.
and
then
there's
of
course
collateral
review
in
the
article
iii
courts,
if
--
if
everything
misfires
within
the
military
justice
system.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
right.
i
--
i
see
the
in-custody
and
exhausted
avenues
provided
in
the
ucmj
as
referring
to
a
phase
before
you
get
to
the
article
iii
courts.
obviously,
if
i'm
reading
it
wrong,
the
court
will
let
me
know,
but
i
read
that
as
prior
to
article
iii
review.
if
i
could
talk
briefly
about
the
1983
legislation
--
it
came
up
in
opposing
counsel's
opening.
i
think
it
sheds
a
lot
of
light
on
the
availability
of
coram
nobis
relief.
when
mr.
taft
testified,
he
wasn't
simply
giving
his
--
he
wasn't
simply
stating
the
state
of
the
law.
he
was
providing
the
state
of
the
law
as
a
premise
for
legislative
action,
in
particular
stripping
collateral
review
authority
from
the
correction
boards,
which
used
to
be
able
to
review
collaterally,
after
final
judgment,
military
convictions.
and
that
existed
before
the
ucmj
was
enacted.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
this
is
the
chief
counsel
for
the
department
of
defense
proposing
the
legislation
and
offering
the
only
premise
there
was
for
the
particular
legislative
change
that
i'm
referring
to,
which
is
stripping
the
--
the
correction
boards
of
this
collateral
review
power
and
saying,
when
we
do
that,
don't
worry,
congress,
because
it
will
channel
these
collateral
--
post-final
collateral
attacks
into
the
military
courts,
and
--
and
they
can
have
habeas.
he
says
habeas
--
i'm
sorry--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--coram
nobis.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
i
don't
read
it
that
way,
your
honor.
i
read
it
as
channeling
apt
post-final
attacks
within
the
military
--
within
the
courts
in
the
military
justice
system,
even
though
the
person
is
--
is
--
a
final
judgment
typically
happens
before
an
individual
is
no
longer
in
the
service.
a
final
judgment
is
final
because
the
discharge
has
been
executed.
so
what
he's
referring
to
is,
once
you
have
a
final
judgment,
you
then
can
seek
collateral
relief
in
the
military
the
way
you
used
to
be
able
to
do
it
in
the
correction
boards
in
the
military
courts.
and
he
was
saying,
now
that
we're
getting
rid
of
this
one
collateral
remedy
in
the
correction
boards,
we're
giving
you
this
other
one.
we're
not
giving
--
we're
just
channeling
all
of
them
into
the
military
appellate
courts,
which
is
a
more
appropriate
judicial
forum.
and
he
says
clearly
it
would
denigrate
the
courts
to
have
administrative
bodies
overturning
their
judgments,
once
again
showing
that
these
are
final
judgments
that
we're
talking
about.
and
the
only
--
that
was
the
only
premise
he
offered
to
make
the
change.
so
stripping
away
one
remedy
while
leaving
another
intact
was
the
single
premise,
which
is
reflected
in
the
house
--
the
senate
report
on
page
52
of
our
brief,
where
congress
adopts
the
exact
language
out
of
his
sworn
testimony
with,
you
know,
a
tiny
variation,
but
that's
the
premise
for
the
change
in
the
legislation.
i'd
also
note
that,
in
that
legislation,
this
is
the
department
of
defense
proposing
to
open
the
door
to
this
court's
jurisdiction
for
the
first
time
in
--
in
28
u.s.c.
1259.
and
when
it
did
that
--
it
had
to
survey
the
whole
landscape
of
military
justice
jurisdiction,
and
when
it
did
that,
it
saw
there
were
direct
review
cases,
which
are
reflected
in
1259
paragraphs
1,
2,
and
3,
and
then
his
other
category
that
is
defined
by
what's
not
in
paragraphs
1,
2,
and
3,
and
that's
the
all
writs
act
cases.
the
government
acknowledges--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--i
think
that's
implicit
in
final
judgment,
your
honor.
if
there's
a
final
judgment.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
your
honor,
the
--
the
key
difference
is
that
--
two
things:
he's
referring
to
post-finality,
which
means
that
the
discharge
or
the
--
you
know,
the
sentence
has
been
executed.
the
person
is
out.
they're
a
civilian
at
that
point.
and
coram
nobis,
by
its
very
nature,
is
someone
who
is
not
in
custody.
so
i
don't
think
it's
too
much
of
an
inference
to
read
that
what
he
is
saying
here
is--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--no,
on
direct
review,
you're
right,
your
honor.
they're
--
they
remain
within
the
service,
and
it's
interesting
that
the
government
cites
mr.
taft's
testimony
as
authoritative
on
that
point.
and
that
--
that
makes
good
sense.
keep
the
person
in
for
a
direct
review
so
that
if
their
sentence
is
set
aside,
we
can
retry.
but
there
has
been
decades
of
military
justice
authority
that
says
even
if
someone
is
discharged
before
their
conviction
is
set
aside
--
so
they're
on
direct
review,
their
conviction
is
set
aside,
after
they're
already
out
in
their
civilian
world,
you
know,
doing
whatever
they're
doing
--
if
the
government
wants
to
retry
them,
they
do.
and
the
government
is
--
is
the
party
that
asserts
continuing
jurisdiction
to
re-prosecute.
and
that's
why
this
case
is
so
distinguishable
from
toth
v.
quarles,
because
in
toth
there
was
no
conviction
while
the
individual
was
on
active
duty.
and
that's
why
there
couldn't
have
been
a
retrial.
here
there
was
conviction
on
active
duty,
which
is
where
jurisdiction
attaches.
it
cements
in.
and
if
the
government
wants
to
invoke
that
to
retry
mr.
denedo,
it
can
try
that.
i
would
say,
though,
that
if
--
if
there
were
a
personal
jurisdiction
loophole
here,
like
there
was
for
the
meja,
the
military
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
act,
congress
could
fix
it
in
a
heartbeat.
but
we're
talking
about,
you
know,
10
cases
in
10
years.
so
even
if
someone,
you
know,
got
away
without
retrial--
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
--i
--
i
think
there
would
be
an
uptick,
and
there
may
actually
have
been
an
uptick
while
this
case
has
been
up
here
at
this
level,
because
it's
--
it
has
gotten
a
lot
of
visibility
in
the
military,
just
like
there
was
an
uptick
after
noyd
v.
bond
when
this
court
declared
for
the
first
time
that
military
courts
had
all
writs
act
power.
so
i
think
there
could
be
an
uptick.
but
once
the
novelty
of
it
wears
off,
i
think
you
will
see
that
level
off,
and
you'll
see
the
same
trend
that
we've
seen
since
66
when
it
was
available
the
first
time.
i
mean,
this
isn't
new.
the
only
thing
new
here
is
the
government's
interpretation
of
article
76.
mr.
matthew
s.
freedus
thank
you,
your
honor.
