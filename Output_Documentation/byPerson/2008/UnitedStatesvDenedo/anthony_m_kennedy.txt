justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
part
--
part
of
independence
is
the
assurance
that
the
court
has
the
ability
to
do
justice
in
the
case
before
it,
and
i
think
the
purpose
of
coram
nobis
or
coram
vobis
is
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
court,
and
that's
all
this
court
is
asking.
so
that's
quite
consistent
with
what
you've
just
said.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
--
but
you're
shifting
ground
a
little
bit.
the
tenor
of
the
questions
from
justice
alito
and
justice
ginsburg
really
is
to
the
effect:
does
coram
nobis
require
an
independent
source
of
--
of
jurisdiction?
and
i
should
think
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
whole
idea
of
coram
nobis
is
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
jurisdiction
the
court
already
has.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
acknowledge
that.
but
there
is
a
source
of
jurisdiction
here.
coram
nobis
is
to
ensure
the
accurate
exercise
of
jurisdiction
that
the
court
has
earlier
asserted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
might
--
you
might
say
that
there
is
a
lurking
constitutional
question
and
that
we
ought
to
interpret
the
statute
to
avoid
a
constitutional
concern.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
civilian
courts
or
the
military
courts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
assume
it
raised
because
justice
breyer
asked
a
question--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
would
be
interested
in
the
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
--
in
coram
nobis
cases
in
the
civil
system,
do
courts
appoint
special
masters
when
they're
an
appellate
court
and
they
have
to
find
out
if
coram
nobis
was--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
do
they
use
district
courts
as
special
masters?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
you
had
--
the
court
had
to
invent
a
procedural
device.
there's
going
to
be
a
new
court-martial,
which
is
a
little
odd
because
it's
a
new
court-martial
sitting
in
judgment
on
somebody
who
isn't
even
in
the
military
anymore.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
all
of
that
is
extra-statutory
in
your
--
this
instance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
second
case
for
announcement
that
i
have
is
08-267,
united
states
versus
denedo.
and
this
case
requires
us
to
determine
the
jurisdiction
of
an
article
i
military
tribunal
to
entertain
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
coram
nobis.
respondent,
jacob
denedo,
is
a
native
nigeria
serving
in
the
united
states
navy
and
he
was
charged
with
defrauding
the
community
college
in
violation
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
with
counsel's
assistance,
denedo
agreed
to
plead
guilty
to
reduced
charges
before
a
special
court-martial
that
convicted
him
and
sentenced
to
three
months
confinement.
after
the
special
court-martial,
the
navy-marine
corps
court
of
criminal
appeals,
which
i'll
just
refer
to
as
the
navy
marine
court,
affirmed
his
conviction.
respondent
was
discharged
from
the
navy
in
2000.
in
the
year
2006,
the
department
of
homeland
security
commenced
removal
proceedings
against
respondent
based
on
his
conviction
before
the
special
court-martial.
to
avoid
deportation,
he
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
coram
nobis
under
the
authority
of
the
all
writs
act.
he
asked
the
navy
marine
court
to
vacate
the
conviction
on
the
ground
that
his
guilty
plea
resulted
from
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
respondent
alleged
that
counsel
had
assured
him
erroneously
as
it
turned
out
that
a
guilty
plea
would
not
subject
him
to
deportation
proceedings.
the
navy
marine
court
determined
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
writ
but
it
declined
to
do
so.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
navy
marine
court's
jurisdictional
holding
but
reversed
this
decision
on
the
merits.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
for
the
navy
marine
court
to
determine
if
respondent
was
entitled
to
coram
nobis,
in
other
words,
both
the
navy
marine
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
held
that
you
could
issue
a
writ
of
--
the
court
could
issue
a
writ
of
coram
nobis
in
appropriate
circumstances.
now
before
deciding
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
military
courts,
we
first
address
our
own.
this
court
has
statutory
jurisdiction
to
review
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
decisions
where
that
court
granted
relief
and
respondent's
case
falls
within
that
statutory
standard.
turning
to
the
underlying
question
presented,
we
hold
that
article
i
military
courts
do
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
coram
nobis
petitions.
they
can
consider
allegations
that
an
earlier
judgment
of
conviction
was
flawed.
coram
nobis
is
an
ancient
common
law
remedy
that
allows
a
court
to
correct
the
fundamental
legal
or
factual
early
--
error
from
an
earlier
proceeding.
a
military
court's
jurisdiction
to
issue
this
extraordinary
writ
and
any
other
relief
for
that
matter
is
determined
by
the
congress.
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
provides
jurisdiction
for
the
navy
marine
court
to
review
court-martial
cases.
because
respondent's
coram
nobis
request
is
simply
a
further
step
in
his
criminal
appeal,
that
court's
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
writ
derives
from
its
earlier
jurisdiction
over
his
appeal
from
the
special
court-martial
conviction.
once
the
navy
marine
court
found
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
respondent's
petition
for
coram
nobis,
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
to
review
that
conclusion.
our
holding
is
a
limited
one.
we
express
no
opinion
on
the
merits
of
respondent's
request
for
coram
nobis
but
we
do
reiterate
that
extraordinary
relief
should
be
obvious.
this
is
reserved
for
extraordinary
cases.
we
conclude
only
that
article
i
military
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
petitions
for
coram
nobis.
with
that
understanding,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
is
affirmed.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia,
thomas,
and
alito
have
joined.
