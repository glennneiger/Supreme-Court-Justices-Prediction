mr.
pratik
a.
shah
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces,
or
caaf,
held
that
military
appellate
courts
possess
open-ended
jurisdiction
under
the
all
writs
act
to
entertain
a
coram
nobis
challenge
to
the
merits
of
a
final
court-martial
conviction.
this
court
should
reverse
that
decision,
both
because
the
all
writs
act
cannot
supply
jurisdiction
that
congress
chose
not
to
confer
and
because
respondent
is
a
civilian
who
may
no
longer
invoke
the
military
court
system.
as
this
court
explained
in
clinton
v.
goldsmith,
military
courts,
as
article
i
courts,
are
strictly
limited
to
the
bases
of
jurisdiction
conferred
upon
them
by
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
or
ucmj.
three
related
aspects
of
the
ucmj
make
clear
that
it
does
not
confer
jurisdiction
over
respondent's
coram
nobis
petition.
first,
as
noted
in
goldsmith,
the
ucmj
narrowly
circumscribes
military
appellate
jurisdiction
to
the
findings
and
sentences
of
a
court-martial
conviction.
that
is
a
direct
review
jurisdiction.
ucmj
articles
66
and
67,
which
define
appellate
jurisdiction,
do
not
contemplate
any
further
review
within
the
military
appellate
courts.
second,
once
direct
appellate
review
is
complete
and
the
military
authority
executes
the
judgment,
ucmj
article
76
affirmatively
forecloses
any
further
military
court
review.
as
this
court
has
recognized
on
two
prior
occasions,
ucmj
article
76
marks
the
terminal
point
of
proceedings
within
the
court-martial
system.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
yes,
article
76
does
that,
but
it
does
more
than
that.
as
this
court
recognized
in
gusik
and
in
councilman,
it
marks
the
end
of
proceedings
within
the
military
court
system.
now,
beyond
the
text,
what
this
court
looked
at
in
gusik
--
in
gusik,
it
was
a
petitioner
seeking
habeas
review.
one
of
his
alternative
arguments
in
gusik
was
that
article
76
essentially
violated
the
suspension
clause
because
it
--
it
marked
the
end
of
--
no
further
proceedings
within
the
military
court
system
as
well
as
within
the
article
iii
court
system.
the
court
agreed
with
the
petitioner
that
article
76
marked
the
end
of
any
further
proceedings
within
the
military
court
system.
it
disagreed
that
it
also
effected
a
repeal
of
article
iii
habeas
jurisdiction,
but
there
was
no
disagreement
between
the
petitioner,
the
government,
and
this
court
in
gusik
that
it
did
mark
the
end
of
proceedings
within
the
military
court
system.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
one
could
say
that,
but
this
court
again
in
councilman
ratified
that
line,
that
the
court
drew
in
gusik.
it
--
it
reiterated
the
reasoning
that
article
76
forecloses
any
further
proceedings
within
the
military
court
system.
so
i
don't
think
it's
just
dicta.
it
was
relevant
to
its
denial
of
the
suspension
clause
claim,
and
the
court
reiterated
that
in
councilman
25
years
later.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
it
appears
that
respondent
no
longer
has
any
further
remedies
to
--
to
pursue.
but
we
think
the
important
point
is
that
in
a
general
--
in
the
general
case,
petitioner
is
bringing
--
the
exact
same
claim
the
respondent
is
bringing
is
normally
going
to
have
several
avenues
of
remedy
outside--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
ucmj
marks
the
high-water
mark
of
process
within
the
military
justice
system.
what
the
ucmj
did
is
it
took
the
prior
system,
which
didn't
even
allow
for
real
direct
review
within
the
military
court
system,
and
it
made
that
direct
review
system
much
more
robust.
it
added
an
intermediate
court
of
review.
it
took
administrative
review
that
was
embodied
within
boards
of
tribunals
that
had
typically
been
under
the
judge
advocate
general.
it
moved
that
out
and
gave
it
greater
independence
to
provide
more
robust
intermediate
appellate
review.
it
added
an
entire
level
of
a
new
court,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces,
which
provided
additional
--
a
new
level
of
review.
and
then
it
said
still--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well
--
well,
your
honor,
in
enacting
the
ucmj,
congress
was
balancing
several
values.
on
the
one
hand,
it
was
balancing
the
rights
of
service
members,
but
at
the
same
time,
it
was
balancing
the
important
value
of
maintaining
good
order
and
discipline
within
the
armed
--
within
the
armed
forces,
mindful
of
the
military's
primary
mission
in
fighting
wars
and
defending
the
nation.
now,
given
those
competing
values,
it
was
--
it
was
reasonable
for
congress
to
draw
a
line
at
some
point
and
say
it,
the
conviction
is
final
and
to
the
extent
you
want
to
seek
further
collateral
review,
you
have
to
go
to
the
civilian
system
to
seek
that
review.
that
--
that
line
is
reasonable
not
only
from
a
historical
standpoint,
but
also
from
a
practical
standpoint,
given
the
institutional
limitations--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--yes,
as
a
general
matter,
there's--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--in
this
case,
respondent
no
longer
has
any
reviews
because
the
time
has
passed.
2241
would--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--no,
there
is
no
further
review,
your
honor,
in
this
case.
now,
as
a
general
matter
there
are
ample
avenues
of
--
of
review
within
the
civilian
court
system.
for
the
entire
time
that
a
petitioner
would
be
confined,
he
can
seek
2241
habeas
relief
in
the
federal
court
system.
even
after--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--1998,
your
honor.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
right.
your
honor,
in
the
denials
i
agree
with
you
that
they
did
not
alert
him
to
deportation,
but
it
based
its
denials
on
his
military
court
convictions.
so
to
that
extent,
he
was
somewhat
on
notice
that
the
military
court
convictions
were
posing
a
problem
to
his
citizenship,
potential
citizenship
status.
now,
it
is
true,
you're
absolutely
right,
that
the
government
did
not
begin
deportation
proceedings
until
october
2006,
and
until
that
time
he
was
not
on
notice,
but
the
fact
that
this
particular
claimant
--
that
the
time
has
run
should
not
be
dispositive.
for
example--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--right.
there
are
two
reasons,
your
honor--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
taft's
testimony
that
you're
referring
to
was
not
given
at
the
time
of
enacting
of
the
ucmj.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
that
was
during
a
subsequent
amending
process
of
the
act.
the
only
testimony--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--it
was
i
think
in
terms
of
the
1983
amendments
to
the
ucmj.
there
have
been
several--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--okay.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
what
mr.
taft
was
testifying
to,
we
believe,
are
--
he
was
--
the
specific
testimony
that
mr.
taft
was
giving
was
related
to
the
boards
of
correction,
i
believe,
and
whether
that
the
boards
of
correction
should
retain
jurisdiction
review
of
final
court-martial
judgments,
so
his
testimony
was
related
to
that
distinct
issue.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
nothing
specific
in
--
in
the
ucmj?
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes,
there's
nothing
specific
in
the
ucmj--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--no,
your
honor.
what
mr.
taft
was
testifying
to
was
the
state
of
the
prevailing
law
in
1983
before
the
caaf.
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
amend
the
ucmj
in
light
of
mr.
taft's
testimony
--
this
court
has
said
on
multiple
occasions
that
we
don't
read
into
congressional
silence--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--right.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
can
read
that
into
the
silence,
and
here
is
why:
we
have
much
more
precise
legislative
history
on
this
very
point.
at
the
time
the
provision
was
enacted,
at
the
time
the
ucmj
was
enacted,
there
was
article
73
of
the
ucmj
provides
one
means
of
collateral
review
within
the
military
justice
system
once
a
court-martial
conviction
is
final,
and
that's
a
new
trial
petition,
which
is
limited
to
certain
subject
matter
and
certain
time
limits.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
to
fraud
on
the
court
and
newly
discovered
evidence.
the
person
who
drafted
that
provision--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--it
does
not
appear
it
would
be
available
to
someone
who
has
entered
a
guilty
plea.
the
government
is
not
aware
of
any
cases
where
the
military
has
granted
an
article
73
petition
to
someone
who
has
pled
guilty.
but
the
important
point
is
at
the
time
that
provision
was
enacted,
the
person
who
drafted
that
provision
testified
before
congress
and
said,
we've
considered
the
universe
of
post-conviction
remedies,
and
specifically
named
coram
nobis
relief,
and
said
that
we've
looked
at
it
and
we
think
the
only
circumstances
that
warrant
appeal
within
the
military
court
system
beyond
coram
nobis
are
those
stated
within
--
or
including
coram
nobis
are
those
stated
within
article
73
specifically.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
i'll
read
--
read
the
testimony
to
you--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--justice
souter.
and
this
appears
on
pages
25
to
26
of
the
government's
brief,
and
it
says:
"what
we
did
was
to
combine
what
amounts
to
a
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
with
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
newly
discovered
evidence.
"
"we
have
provided
for
both
of
them
and
to
our
minds
they
are
the
only
additional
circumstances
over
and
above
the
appeal
that
need
a
remedy.
"
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
so
i
think
that's
--
that's
conclusive
on
this
point
and
provides
a
firm
ground
on
which
to
distinguish
this
court's
decision
in
morgan,
which
you
referenced
earlier,
that
--
that
applies
coram
nobis
in
the
article
iii
system.
congress
considered
it
for
the
article
i
system
and
rejected
it
in
the
military
courts.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
don't
think
it's
to
eliminate
coram
nobis.
it
was
never
available
within
the
military
court
system.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
there
are
two
distinctions
--
at
least
two
distinctions,
your
honor:
the
first
is,
in
the
federal
court
system,
there
is
an
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction
when
someone
is
bringing
a
federal
constitutional
challenge,
collateral
challenge
to
their
conviction.
that
separate
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction
is
1331.
there's
--
there's
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction.
the
all
writs
act
does
not
confer
jurisdiction.
the
court
made
that
very
clear
in
goldsmith.
what
it
requires
is
an
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction.
that
exists
in
article
iii
courts.
it
does
not
exist
in
the
military
court
system.
that's
the
first
distinction.
the
second
distinction,
your
honor,
even
if
this
court
wasn't
convinced
by
that
jurisdictional
argument,
is
that
congress
specifically
considered
whether
to
--
to
allow
coram
nobis
petitions
within
the
military
court
system.
the
all
writs
act
was
designed
to
be
a
residual
source
of
authority
to
fill
gaps
within
the
system.
it
is
not--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
again,
i
would
--
i
would
quibble
with
the
characterization
to
--
to
--
that
it
was
previously
available.
as
of
the
enactment
of
the
ucmj
in
1950,
coram
nobis
relief
had
never
been
available
within
the
military
justice
system.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
right.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
the
difference
is
significant,
your
honor.
in
the
--
in
the
military
court
system
there
is
only
one
avenue
for
post-conviction
relief.
that
is,
after
your
--
and
i'm
speaking
after
your
direct
review
--
appellate
review
process
has
been
complete,
there's
only
one,
and
that
is
the
article
73
new
trial
petition.
of
course,
in
--
in
the
article
iii
system
there
are
several
independent
grants
of
jurisdiction,
the
habeas
jurisdiction--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--right.
in
--
in
morgan,
your
honor,
the
court
was
refuting
the
argument
that
2255,
section
2255,
occupied
the
field
and,
therefore,
there
wouldn't
be
a
coram
nobis
petition.
it
rejected
that
argument.
but
i
don't
think
the
rejection
of
that
argument
means
that
coram
nobis,
which
is
still
a
residual
source
of
authority,
is
available
when
congress
has
specifically
rejected
its
application
within
the
article
i
system.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
this
court
could
not
have
been
clearer
in
goldsmith.
it
says
the
all
writs
act
requires
an
independent
basis,
an
existing
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
would
argue
that
the
past
jurisdiction
in
this
case
does
not
constitute
an
existing
basis
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
okay.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
if
he
is
still
within
custody--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
if
the
military
isn't
willing
to
correct
that
sort
of
error
on
its
own
as
an
administrative
matter
and
that
he
needs
some
judicial
forum
to--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--to
get
relief,
he
can
go
to
the
court
of
federal
claims
and
bring
a
tucker
act
action.
there's
a
6-year
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well
--
well,
then,
your
honor,
he
probably
wouldn't
have
a
judicial
forum.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--justice
breyer,
to
make
your
hypothetical
work
he
has
to
no
longer
be
in
custody.
he
has
had
to
have
discovered
this
error
6
years
after
the
conviction
has
happened.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
the
military
would
have
had
to
deny
this
--
correcting
his--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well
--
well,
your
honor,
once
again,
in
your
hypothetical,
i
think
there
would
be
an
administrative
recourse
there.
and,
of
course,
there's
always
the
fail-safe
of
a
presidential
pardon
if
the
obvious
--
if
the
error
is
that
obvious
and
that
egregious.
now,
you
did
refer
to
a
second
argument,
which
is
an
independent
argument,
which
is
that
the
military
courts
lack
jurisdiction
for
the
independent
reason
that
respondent
--
it's
an
independent
reason,
your
honor,
that
he
lacks
any
remaining
connection
to
the
armed
forces
and,
therefore,
cannot
invoke
the
military
courts.
this
court
held
in
toth
v.
quarles
that
congress
lacks
power
under
article
i
to
extend
military
court
jurisdiction
over
a
civilian,
and
that--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
once
again,
that
would
be
relying
on
the
long-expired
past
jurisdiction.
it
is--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
because
the
military
--
congress
specifically
contemplated
that
possibility,
and
now
i'm
going
back
to
my
article
73
argument,
your
honor,
and
to
the
legislative
history
which
shows
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
article
73.
that
is
to
encapsulate
--
whatever
post-conviction
remedy
it's
intended
to
be
available
within
the
military
court
system
appears
in
article
73
that
considered
coram
nobis.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
i
think
this--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
i
think
the
structure
of
the
military
court
system
is
different
than
the
civilian
system,
and
--
and
that
goes
back
to--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--yes,
your
honor.
in
the
military
court
system,
article
76,
even
though
it
was
first
enacted
in
19
--
in
1950,
there
were
other
provisions
analogous
to
it.
it's
always
been
understood
within
the
military
system
that,
once
a
conviction
was
final
and
the
military
authority
executed
the
judgment,
that
was
it
in
terms
of
review
within
the
military
justice
system,
save
for
a
presidential
pardon.
any
further
relief
to
be
obtained
was
through
an
article
iii
habeas
petition
in
the
federal
courts.
that's
the
understanding
that
congress
had
when
it
enacted
the
ucmj,
and
that's
the
understanding--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
the
difference
is,
in
morgan,
the
court
specifically
said
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
occupy
the
field
when
it
passed
2255
governing
habeas
relief
for
federal
prisoners.
that's
not
the
situation
here.
we
know
that
congress
intended
to
occupy
the
field
when
it
passed
article
73.
so
regardless
of
the
jurisdictional
arguments,
your
honor,
there's
no
right
of
action,
there's
no
right
of
coram
nobis
relief
within
the
military
courts.
your
honor,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
thank
you.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
not
if
he
is
past
his
enlistment
period,
no,
your
honor.
the
government's
view
is
they
would
not
be
able
to
retry
him.
i'd
just
like
to
make
four
quick
points
in
response:
first,
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
could
someone
be
in
custody
after
finality?
of
course,
yes,
that
--
that
could
be
the
case.
the
military
doesn't
have
to
issue
a
bad
conduct
discharge
as
part
of
its
sentence.
he
could
still
be
in
confinement
within
the
military
during
the
post-finality
period.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
noyd
v.
bond
is
clearly
distinguishable.
that
dealt
with
habeas
review
within
the
military
while
the
person
was
still
pursuing
his
direct
appeal.
so
there
was
a
clear,
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction
in
the
noyd
v.
bond
type
situation,
and
that's
the
article
66
and
67
direct
review
jurisdiction,
and
that--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well
--
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
habeas
would
be
in
aid
of
the
direct
review
jurisdiction.
in
--
in
noyd
--
in
the
noyd
v.
bond--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
what
was
going
on
in
noyd
v.
bond,
your
honor,
is
he
was
pursuing
a
habeas
petition
for
release
pending
the
--
the
resolution
of
his
direct
appeal.
so
the
military
courts
just
referred
the
petition
to
the
same
court
reviewing
his
direct
appeal
on
the
merits,
and
it
became
part
and
parcel
of
that
jurisdiction.
the
third
point
i
would
like
to
--
to
make
is
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
which
shows
the
incompatibility
of
coram
nobis
relief
within
the
military
justice
system.
that
they've
had
to
create
this
dubay
procedure
where
--
where
a
new
court-martial
--
and
dubay
sets
this
out.
the
new
court-martial
does
have
to
be
convened,
and
then
they
would
have
a
factfinding
tribunal
in
which
new
--
a
new
military
judge
would
have
to
be
assigned
to
govern
it.
none
of
that
is
specified
within
congress's
scheme.
that
has
all
been
created.
it
shows
the
incompatibility
of
the
practical
burdens
that
this
procedure
places
on
the
military.
and
nothing
in
article
66(c)
which
governs
the
jurisdiction
of
the
military
appellate
courts,
the
intermediate
courts,
references
any
independent
factfinding
power.
it
says
in
a
case
referred
to
it,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
may
act
only
with
respect
to
the
findings
and
sentence
as
approved
by
the
convening
authority.
it
may
affirm
only
such
findings
of
guilty
and
the
sentence
or
such
part
or
amount
of
the
sentence
as
it
finds
correct
in
law
and
fact
and
determines
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
record.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
the
fourth
--
fourth
point
is
in
response
to
justice
breyer.
my
military
colleagues
inform
me
that
in
the
situation
of
a
true
clerical
error,
they
could
go
to
the
board
of
correction
of
military
review
and
seek
correction
of
that
error.
