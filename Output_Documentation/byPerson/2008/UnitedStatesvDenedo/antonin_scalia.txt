therefore,
one
can
say
that
that
point
wasn't
decided
in
the
case,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
"they
must"?
do
you
think
it's
unconstitutional
to
deprive
them
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
you
mean
by
"they
must
have"?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine,
but
--
but
is
it
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
say
military
courts
are
different,
they've
always
been
different,
the
need
for
finality
is
greater
there,
and
we're
conducting
a
different
rule
for
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
oh,
oh,
so
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
they
did
not
leave
in
its
place
an
adequate
and
effective
substitute--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
would
cover
every
situation
no
matter
how
fanciful,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
--
did
coram
nobis
relief
--
you
say
it
has
to
be
there.
was
it
ever
used
before
in
the
military
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
worse
still.
my
goodness.
so
you
were--
justice
antonin
scalia
--convicted
by
a
court-martial
and
had
no
basis
for
--
for
getting
that
revised,
and
that
--
that
lasted
for
a
couple
of
hundred
years,
right?
and
that
was
okay
or
it
wasn't
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine.
i
mean,
you
can
patch
it
up
and
say
that
they
thought
it
wasn't
a
good
idea
to
have
just
military
courts.
but
it's
very
hard
to
make
the
constitutional
argument
you're
making
when
for
a
couple
hundred
years
in
military,
in
military
courts,
which
are
different,
there
--
there
was
no
relief
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
were
saying
it
is.
just
say,
no,
it's
not
constitutionally
compelled,
and
i'll
be
happy.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
much
of
a
lurk
if,
for
200
years,
this
was
going
on
without
ever
--
it's
not
lurking
to
my
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
person
retried,
do
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
he
still
in
the
military?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
talking
about
somebody
still
within
the
military,
if
i
--
if
i
heard
the
quote
correctly,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shah,
could
you
tell
us
what
the
government's
position
is
on
whether,
when
somebody
has
been
discharged
from
the
service
and
then
a
conviction
which
he
--
which
he
suffered
while
he
was
in
the
service
is
set
aside,
can
he
be
retried
in
military
courts?
