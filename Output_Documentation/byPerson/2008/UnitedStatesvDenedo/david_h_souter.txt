justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
time
--
i
mean,
the
time
may
very
well
run
in
the
civil
system,
and
yet
i
take
it
that
under
--
you
accept
morgan,
and
in
the
--
in
the
article
iii
system
this
--
in
comparable
circumstances,
this
petitioner
could
seek
coram
nobis.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
take
it
you
also
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
that
the
all
writs
act
applies
to
the
article
i
court
as
well
as
to
the
article
iii
court.
and
i
take
it
--
and
i'd
like
your
response
to
this.
i
take
it
you
accept
the
fact
that
in
testimony
before
the
house,
at
least,
at
the
--
at
the
time
the
present
system
went
into
effect,
the
general
counsel
for
the
department
of
defense,
mr.
taft,
testified
to
a
house
committee
that
coram
nobis
would
be
available
in
the
--
in
the
article
i
courts.
and
if
that
is
so,
isn't
the
--
kind
of
the
most
reasonable
way
to
construe
the
statute,
including
article
76,
as
allowing
for
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
was
the
occasion
for
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
were
they
amending
at
the
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
way
ahead
of
me
because
i
don't
know
what
the
'83
amendments
would
refer
to.
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
was
the
subject
matter?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
with
respect
to
the
boards
of
correction,
i
take
it
there's
nothing
specifically
in
the
statute
that
says
there's
coram
nobis
jurisdiction?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
if
he
was
right
about
that,
that
would
undercut
your
--
your
argument
that,
with
respect
to
a
special
court-martial
and
subsequent
proceedings,
there
could
be
no
coram
nobis,
because
there's
no
specific
reference
in
the
statute
in
either
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
quite
agree.
the
premise
of
my
--
sort
of
my
argument
to
you
a
second
ago
was
that
if
we
accept
the
proposition
that
mr.
taft
was
making
a
correct
statement
of
law--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
the
logic
would
in
effect
answer
your
argument
that
because
there
is
no
specific
grant
of
coram
nobis
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
special
court-martials
and
subsequent
proceedings,
there
couldn't
be
any.
that's
the
only
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
is
pretty
limited.
what
is
it,
it's
limited
to
fact
and
fraud?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
--
may
i
ask
you
just
--
and
i'm
doing
this
from
memory,
so
i
--
my
--
my
premise
of
the
question
may
be
wrong.
but
i
do
recall
the
quotation
of
testimony
in
the
brief,
and
i
--
if
i
recall
it
correctly,
the
person
testifying
said
that
--
that
73
was
sort
of
a
combination
of
coram
nobis
and
new
--
and
new
trial
motion
practice.
but
my
recollection
was
that
there
was
no
statement,
or
at
least
it
wasn't
quoted
in
the
briefs,
to
the
effect
that
this
is
all
there
is.
now,
there
--
it
was
explaining
what
73
did,
but
it
was
not
an
explanation
to
the
effect
that
if
you
didn't
get
under
the
--
the
tent
flap
in
73,
you
were
out
completely.
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
i
stand
corrected.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know,
but
that's
--
that's
a
different
--
that's
a
different
issue
from
--
from
whether
it
--
it
may
retain
some
residual
jurisdiction
to
correct
an
error
with
respect
to
someone
over
whom
it
has
had
jurisdiction.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
--
you
made
that
point
before.
and
i
want
to
--
i
want
to
follow
up
with
one
question
on
that.
as
i
recall,
it
was
in
response
to
the
--
to
the
morgan
argument.
the
--
the
morgan
analysis
was,
well,
this
isn't
a
--
a
new
ground
or
a
new
assertion.
it
is
jurisdiction
as
would
be
the
case
in
habeas.
it,
in
effect,
is
--
is
kind
of
a
metaphysical
continuation
of
the
--
the
jurisdiction
that
existed
before.
and
your
response
to
that
was,
in
effect,
a
goldsmith
response.
and
--
and
you
said
past
jurisdiction
doesn't
mean
present
jurisdiction.
the
past
jurisdiction
is
over,
and
that's
under
--
under
the
statute
and
under
goldsmith.
that's
--
that's
the
end
of
it.
couldn't
that
same
argument
simply
have
been
made,
however,
in
--
in
morgan?
in
other
words,
morgan
was
a
case
in
which
the
point
of
finality
had
been
reached.
there
was
no
specific
statute
in
morgan
saying
there's
coram
nobis
jurisdiction,
and
yet
the
court's
analysis
--
i
--
i
called
it
"metaphysical"
a
second
ago
--
was
that
this
really
was
simply
a
continuation
of
the
past
jurisdiction.
if
that
was
a
sound
argument
in
morgan,
why
isn't
it
a
sound
argument
with
respect
to
the
--
the
military
code
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
--
it
did
do
that,
and
there's
--
there's
no
question
that
it
certainly
made
finality
provisions
in
article
76.
but
in
the
civilian
system,
so
far
as
express
provision
is
concerned,
there
are
limits.
there
are
statutes
of
limitations,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
argument
could
be
made
there
that
was
made
here--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
was
made
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
outside
of
1531,
is
there
any
structural
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
could
say
the
same
thing,
that
when
the
statute
of
limitations
is
past
in
a
habeas
case
or,
indeed,
after
habeas
has
been
followed,
that
so
far
as
the
statutes
governing
article
iii
courts
are
concerned,
that's
the
end.
and
yet
morgan
says,
no,
it
isn't
the
end.
there's
this
coram
nobis
jurisdiction.
justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
say
it's
lurking,
you're
--
you're
invoking
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
avoidance?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
where
are
--
where
are
the
procedures
set
out
for
--
for
military
habeas?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
--
are
you
arguing
then
that
if
it
has
habeas
power
without
a
--
a
textual
basis,
there's
no
reason
to
argue
that
it
lacks
coram
nobis
power
because
there's
no
textual
basis?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
has
direct
review
got
to
do
with
habeas?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
the
civil
system,
we
regard
it
as
--
as
entirely
a
separate
proceeding.
