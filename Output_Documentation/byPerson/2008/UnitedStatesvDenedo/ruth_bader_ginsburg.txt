mr.
shah,
how
does
that
differ
from
the
general
rule
that
a
judgment
becomes
final
and
has
preclusive
effect
once
the
appellate
route
has
been
exhausted
or
the
time
to
pursue
it
has
expired?
it
seems
to
me
that
article
76
simply
codifies
the
rule
that
applies
ordinarily
in
criminal
cases,
in
civil
cases,
stating
when
a
judgment
becomes
final
for
preclusion
purposes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where,
in
your
view,
in
that
the
government
is
putting
forward,
can
this
--
can
denedo
go?
he
said,
i
was
misinformed
by
my
counsel.
i
never
would
have
entered
a
plea
if
i
had
known
i
would
be
subject
to
deportation.
and
he
said,
i
never
found
out
about
it
until,
what,
8
years
later,
when
the
government
--
8
years
after
his
conviction,
the
government
said,
you're
subject
to
deportation.
where
can
he
go
with
that
plea?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
assuming
now,
because
we
haven't
gone
any
further
than
his
plea,
that
he
was
so
misinformed
and
he
didn't
lack
diligence
in
failing
to
bring
it
earlier,
that
he
was
surprised
by
the
government's
action,
so
he
was
unaware
and,
therefore,
unable
to
make
this
plea
any
earlier.
you
have
given
us
the
answer
that
it's
too
bad,
he's
just
out
of
any
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shah,
you
just
said
something
about
--
you
answered
my
question
and
justice
stevens's
question:
this
person
is
out
because
it's
too
late
for
him.
he
was
convicted
in
what,
was
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
and
the
government
never
said
anything
about
deportation
until
2006?
and
they
went
through
--
he
twice
applied
for
naturalization,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
he
was
turned
down
on
grounds
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
deportation.
the
government
never
alerted
him
to
the
possibility
that
he
would
be
deportable.
they
turned
down
his
applications
with
no
hint
of
that,
and
you
say
that
he
is
--
he's
out
of
time,
but
nothing
counts
against
the
government
because
of
that
8-year
lapse?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
--
is
it
available
to
someone
who
enters
a
guilty
plea,
if
you
know?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
the
morgan
case
said
that
coram
nobis
was
not
dependent
on
any
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction.
didn't
the
court
say
that
a
coram
nobis
application
challenging
a
conviction
is
a
step
in
the
criminal
case
and
not
like
habeas,
where
relief
is
sought
in
a
separate
case
and
record,
the
beginning
of
a
separate
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
making
--
i
thought
that
the
core
of
your
argument
is
that
the
all
writs
act
applies
to
all
courts
established
by
congress,
the
military
courts
are
included
in
that
definition,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
all
writs
act
that
says
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
military.
but
the
all
writs
act
requires
that
the
writ
be
in
aid
of
the
court's
jurisdiction.
so
if
you
would
spell
out
how
the
writ
here
is
in
aid
of
the
military
court's
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where?
colorable--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
was
--
that
question
wasn't
resolved,
was
it?
i
thought
we
were
just
talking
about
the
authority
of
the
military
courts
to
issue
this
writ,
and
the
question
that
justice
breyer
has
raised,
well,
is
this
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
adequate
grounds
to
issue
the
writ?
i
thought
that
question
was
certainly
not
raised
before
this
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
military
courts
now,
since
1950,
have
quite
a
record
of
saying
coram
nobis
is
available
in
these
courts.
however,
they
have
routinely
thrown
out
the
cases
on
the
merits.
is
there
any
case
within
the
military
where
the
military
has
said
anything
like
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
qualifies
as
a
reason
to
grant
the
writ?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
correctly
that
since
1989
there
were
a
total
of
30
coram
nobis
petitions
filed,
and
of
those
only
4
were
granted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
military
courts
have
habeas
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
what
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
quote
you
referred
to
from
goldsmith
says:
"and
a
servicemember
in
custody".
so
i
think
goldsmith,
in
that
footnote
that
you're
citing,
is
presenting
a
service
member
still
in
custody,
having
exhausted
all
other
areas,
can
come
to
a
federal
district
court
and
seek
habeas.
it's
not
talking
about
someone
who
is
out
of
the
military.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
am
i
missing?
i
thought
that
the
footnote
reads
once
a
criminal
conviction
has
been
finally
reviewed
within
the
military
system
a
service
member,
having
exhausted
all
other
areas,
can
petition
in
a
federal
district
court
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
i
don't
see
anything
that
talks
about
someone
who
is
no
longer
a
service
member.
