chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
08-267,
united
states
v.
denedo.
mr.
shah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
freedus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
which
case
of
ours
establishes
the
proposition
that
there
always
has
to
be
an
available
avenue
of
relief?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
different
than
saying
there
always
has
to
be
available
relief.
that's
saying
you
think
congress
usually
intends
there
to
be
available
relief.
and
that
would
be
a
doubtful
assumption
here,
given
the
rather
clear
expressions
of
finality
that
--
that
are
--
that
are
in
the
ucmj
statutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
--
you
don't
think
there's
authority
for
the
proposition
they
can
do
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
looking
for
authority
that
says
they
can't
do
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
like
it
very
much.
but
what
is
--
your
argument
is
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
that
this
person
have,
right
now,
an
available
avenue
of
relief,
your
position?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
then
it
becomes,
as
justice
kennedy
suggested,
a
question
of
whether
or
not
we
should
read
the
statutes
here
in
a
particular
way
to
avoid
confronting
that
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
collateral
consequences
of
the
conviction
are
pretty
dramatic.
in
this
case,
they
decide
whether
this
guy
stays
in
the
country
or
is
deported.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
so
i
think
justice
breyer's
question
is
still
on
the
table.
why
would
congress
intend
to
afford
greater
relief
and
remedies
to
somebody
who's
outside
--
was
within
the
military
system
and
is
now
outside,
than
to
an
ordinary
civilian
under
article
iii
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
within
--
within
the
military
system?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
within
the
system.
i
mean,
the
difference
with
this
case
is
that
you're
talking
about
somebody
who
is
--
i
guess
that's
the
issue
--
out
of
the
military
system.
the
problem
with
your
position
is
that
it
would
dramatically
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
military
system.
it
would
sort
of
follow
everybody
they've
dealt
with
around
for
their
life,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
at
any
time
somebody
who
is
out
of
the
military
system,
whose
judgment
is
supposedly
final
under
the
provisions
that
congress
has
established,
he
could
come
back
and
knock
on
the
door
20
years
later
and
say,
i
want
to
review
my
conviction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
he
would
be
within
the
military
system.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
he's
back
in
the
military
system,
20
years
later?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
for
someone
still
within
the
military
system?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
answer--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
justice
ginsburg
is
that
we
have
never
held
that
with
respect
to
a
situation
like
the
facts
here,
where
you're
dealing
with
somebody
who
is
outside
--
long
departed
from
the
military
system?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
--
this
is
at
a
hearing.
this
isn't
a
member
of
congress,
obviously,
that
we're
talking
about.
it's
not
even
a
single
member
of
congress?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
the
specific--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--under
the
specific
provision
that
was
at
issue,
which
is
accompanied
by
very
strict
finality
provisions.
there's
no
suggestion
in
his
testimony
that
the
availability
of
the
relief
that
he's
talking
about
continues
after
the
individual
is
outside
the
military
system.
he's
channeling
--
he
says
these
are
channeled
through
a
specific
provision
applicable
only
within
the
military
system.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i've
had
the
chance
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
senate
report,
and
like
mr.
taft's
testimony,
there's
no
suggestion
in
there
that
the
relief
he's
talking
about
continues
after
someone
is
out
of
the
service.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
a
final
judgment
is
subject
to
review
in
the
appellate
courts
within
--
in
the
military
system,
just
like
you
have
--
a
final
court
of
appeals
judgment
is
subject
to
review
in
our
system.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
have
review
in
the
appellate
system
--
someone
is
--
the
judgment
is
they're
to
be
discharged,
and
they
seek
review.
are
they
discharged
while
the
review
is
going
on?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
--
you
don't
think
that
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
we're
going
to
see
a
lot
more
coram
nobis
petitions
than
we
did
before?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
shah,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
you
briefly
make
your
fourth
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
