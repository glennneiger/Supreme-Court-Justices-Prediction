ms.
katherine
burnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
claim
in
bell's
case
is
the
textbook
example
of
a
claim
that
the
effective
death
penalty
intended
for
2254(d)
to
apply
to.
in
the
virginia
supreme
court,
bell
presented
his
claim
with
his
allegations
of
what
he
says
counsel
didn't
present
and
didn't
find
at
trial.
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
assumed
the
truth
of
all
of
those
allegations
and
did
not
contest
any
of
them.
there
were
never
any
facts
in
dispute.
the
state
never
contested
any
facts.
the
state
court
assumed
them
all
true,
and
then
applied
--
faithfully
applied
this
court's
established
precedent
under
strickland
and
wiggins,
in
particular,
and
weighed
that
evidence
that
he
had
claimed
had
not
been
found
by
his
counsel
against
the
aggravating
evidence
in
this
case
of
a
drug
dealer
who
killed
premeditatedly
a
police
officer
in
a
small
town
and
upon
weighing
that
found
as
a
--
as
a
matter
--
as
a
de
novo
matter
on
the
merits
that
he
could
not
show
prejudice.
because
there
was
no
reasonable
probability
that
a
jury
would
have
found
a
life
sentence
giving
--
assuming
the
truth
of
everything
he
alleged.
now,
when
he
went
to
federal
court,
the
fourth
circuit
faithfully
applied
2254(d)
to
that
after
addressing
all
of
the
same
evidence
and
also
agreeing
that
there
was
no
prejudice,
and
then
said
that
the
state
court
decision
was
not
unreasonable
under
2254(d).
now,
bell
comes
to
this
court
and
says
for
the
first
time
that
i
have
a
new
claim,
and
that
was
not
made
below,
and
this
is
not
a
new
claim.
everything
that
he
presented
in
federal
court
was
presented
to
the
state
court.
there
is
absolutely
no
difference.
in
fact,
to
the
effect
that
there
was
some
difference
in
the
district
court
and
the
state
alleged
--
we
pleaded
default
because
he
presented
a
few
new
affidavits.
the
district
court
resolved
that
and
said:
i'm
not
even
going
to
look
at
those
because
they
aren't
critical
to
my
decision.
i
am
only
going
to
look
at
--
and
he
described
in
particular
the
exact
same
record
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
had
found.
and
then
the
district
court--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
there
were
approximately
12
issues
in
this
case
that
the
district
court
disposed
of
in
a
very
lengthy
opinion.
it
was
only
this
one
issue
that
the
district
court
found
--
believed
that
he
needed
to
have
a
hearing
on,
we
believe
erroneously.
but,
nevertheless,
he
had
the
hearing
and
--
and
listened
to
all
the
same
evidence.
nothing,
justice
ginsburg
--
in
our
opinion
nothing
prevented
bell
from
presenting
the
allegations
that
were
presented
to
the
federal
court
and
all
the
allegations
that
he
presented
to
the
state
court.
there
was
no
state
court
procedure
or
denial
of
anything.
ms.
katherine
burnett
your
honor,
i
don't
--
i
don't--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--he
may
very
well
have,
but
the
point
is
that
there
was
nothing
that
he
presented
to
the
federal
court
that
he
didn't
also
present
to
the
state
court.
so
he
was
not
prevented
from
--
that
--
that's
a
red
herring
in
this
case.
now,
he
had
some
very
strong
arguments
that
he
made
in
both
the
state
court
and
in
the
district
court
on
other
claims;
not
on
this
claim
but
on
other
claims,
that
he
believed
that
he
should
have
been
able
to
develop
certain
evidence.
and
the
district
court
actually
on
those
other
claims
--
some
of
them,
it
found
faulted
and
some
not.
but
not
on
this
claim.
on
this
claim--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--i
think
my
answer
to
that
has
to
be
that
it
depends
because
the
statute
before
the
effective
death
penalty
act
in
1996
had
clearly
had
what
we
would
call
the
chandler
v.
dane
factors
in
which
would
you
look
at
the
adequacy
of
a
state
court
process.
those
were
removed
after
1996,
so
the
statute
does
not
provide
authority
for
a
federal
court
to
go
in
and
determine
was
the
process
adequate
if
the
decision,
itself,
was
reasonable.
now
if
we
are
talking
--
this
is
why
this
case--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--justice
souter,
we
don't
believe
so
and
here's
why:
because
it
is
true,
congress
did
not
change
the
procedural
default
doctrine.
in
the
effective
death
penalty
act
congress
left
that
alone.
in
fact,
this
court
recognized
that
in
house
v.
bell.
so
when
we
are
talking
about
new
facts
or
new
claims,
either
one,
you're
talking
about
unexhausted
or
defaulted
matters,
which
the
district
courts
are
very
familiar
how
to
handle
that.
has
he
shown
cause
and
prejudice?
has
he
shown
diligence?
ms.
katherine
burnett
justice
souter
--
and
i
agree
that's
not
this
case.
but
this
court's
already
crossed
that
bridge.
that
was
michael
williams.
michael
williams
was
where
the
individual
comes
to
federal
court
with
brand
new
evidence
and
he
has
no
remedy
left
in
state
court.
it
is
defaulted,
and
what
do
we
do
with
that?
and
this
court
very
clearly
--
now,
as
the
issue
was
presented
to
this
court
in
that
case
it
was
whether
he
gets
a
hearing
or
not,
so
that's
what
was
addressed.
but
this
court
also
addressed
the
fact
that
it
most
likely
was
and
was
a
defaulted
claim
and
that
it--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--and
i
--
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
it's
not
this
case.
i
think
michael
williams
addresses
it
and
i
think
that
the
current
existing
in
place
cause
and
prejudice
and
actual
innocence
exceptions
to
default
answer
all
of
that.
and
i
believe
that--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--well,
what
i'm
saying--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--well,
no.
i
believe
that--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--i
believe
that
(d)(2)
very
clearly
--
yes,
i
think
i'm
agreeing
with
you
that
(d)(2)
addresses
the
actual
facts
which
underlay
the
state
court
decision.
ms.
katherine
burnett
correct.
ms.
katherine
burnett
correct.
ms.
katherine
burnett
justice
breyer,
i'm
not
sure
they
they've
argued
those
exceptions
(a)(2)
at
(i)
and
(ii).
i
believe
they're
simply
arguing--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--my
reading
of
their
brief
is
they
are
saying:
we
are
michael
williams
and
all
michael
williams
dealt
with
was
the
opening
sentence
of
(e)(2).
ms.
katherine
burnett
of
(e)(2).
ms.
katherine
burnett
"if
the
applicant
has
failed
to
develop.
"
and
michael
williams
interpreted
that
as
someone
who
has
not
been
diligent
in
developing
the
record.
ms.
katherine
burnett
yes,
your
honor,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--yes,
and
here's
why:
because
virginia
has
twin
statutes
that
would
bar
any
further
applications
to
state
court.
one
is
the
statute
of
limitations
that
is
strictly
applied
and
the
other
is
a
statute
which
says
in
essence--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--that's
correct.
ms.
katherine
burnett
and
this
court
has--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--it
is
defaulted,
yes,
your
honor.
in
virginia
those
are
defaulted
claims,
and
now
we
are
in
federal
court
with
those
claims.
the
federal
court
judges
are
very
familiar
with
how
to
do
with
them.
has
he
shown
cause
and
prejudice?
ms.
katherine
burnett
not
in
state
court.
ms.
katherine
burnett
no,
your
honor.
ms.
katherine
burnett
that's
correct.
so
now
he
is
in
federal
court
and
he
has
--
he
has
the
thresholds
of
cause
and
prejudice
or
actual
innocence.
and
that's
a
very
familiar
thing,
is
what
i'm
saying,
is
that
the
district
courts
are
familiar
with.
ms.
katherine
burnett
that's
not
this
case.
but
in
a
hypothetical
case
where
there
are
new
facts,
unexhausted
defaulted
claims
or
facts
that
are
presented
to
a
federal
court--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--well,
i
think
not.
ms.
katherine
burnett
the
argument
is--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--well,
our
argument
is
that,
court,
don't
use
this
case
to
say
that,
because
if
the
court
uses
this
case
to
say
that
it
will
be
putting
its
imprimatur
on
what
the
district
court
did
in
holding
a
hearing
when
we
don't
think
it
was
appropriate.
ms.
katherine
burnett
they
did
not.
it
was
not
presented
to
them,
your
honor.
nothing--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--i
think
the
court
could
dismiss
this
as
improvidently
granted.
ms.
katherine
burnett
i
think
the
court
could
do
that.
ms.
katherine
burnett
justice
stevens,
there
was
never
any
showing,
there
was
never
any
showing
of
diligence.
ms.
katherine
burnett
the
federal
court
simply
announced
that
he
was
going
to
hold
a
hearing
on
this
claim
and
decide
later--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
first
he
had--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--i
think
that
was
the
misunderstanding.
ms.
katherine
burnett
the
way
i
read
the
statute
is
that
that
is
the
first
thing
that
the
judge
was
required
to
do.
he
had
to
first
determine
whether
the
state
court's
decision
was
reasonable.
ms.
katherine
burnett
he
can
--
i
think
--
i
think
then
we
are
talking
about
what
i
was
just
saying,
new
facts,
new
claims.
ms.
katherine
burnett
and
then
the
judge
has
to
go
through
the
determination,
before
he
can
decide
whether
he
can
look
at
it,
of
whether
these
new
facts
or
new
claims
meet
cause
and
prejudice
or
actual
innocence.
ms.
katherine
burnett
i
don't
think
just
--
i
do
not
believe
the
judge
can
do
that--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--just
simply
to
say
i'm
going
to
look
at
just
the
correctness
of
the
decision
first,
and
then
decide
whether
it's
correct.
ms.
katherine
burnett
well,
i
think
it
is,
unless
--
unless
there
are
actually
new
matters
that
are
presented
to
the
federal
court
that
the
federal
court
now
is
going
to--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--yes.
even
on
the
same
claim.
ms.
katherine
burnett
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
see
that
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
very
orderly
progression,
that
the
--
that
the
--
the
effective
death
penalty
act
is
now
telling
district
court
judges,
and
has
made
clear
that
it's
doing
this
for
judicial
--
for
purposes
of
judicial
economy,
for
finality,
for--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--it
could
do
that,
justice
scalia.
ms.
katherine
burnett
i
think
--
i
think
that
doesn't
really
fit
with
the
statute
--
with
the
statutory
language.
ms.
katherine
burnett
yes.
ms.
katherine
burnett
yes.
absolutely.
and
that's
what
i'm
saying,
and
i
think
that
--
to
--
if
the
claim
is
going
to
in
any
way
differ,
it's
going
to
change
from
what
was
presented
to
the
state
court.
on
one
level,
that
is
all
new
matters
that
are
defaulted,
and
in
a
very
literal
sense
how
can
--
and
i
don't
believe
congress
intended
for
federal
courts
to
look
at
new
matters,
however
they
got
to
them,
that
were
not
presented
to
the
state
court,
and
on
that
basis
determine
whether
the
state
court's
decision
was
reached.
ms.
katherine
burnett
the
federal
court
is
supposed
to
first
look
at
the
claim
that
was
presented
to
the
state
court,
under
2254(d),
and
the
claimants
before
it.
if
it's
the
same
claim,
if
it's
the
same
matters
that
were
adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
the
state
court,
it
has
to
make
the
decision
up
front,
was
it
reasonable
or
not?
ms.
katherine
burnett
okay.
now
it
makes
that
decision,
and
then
after
that,
if
the
petitioner
says
well,
i
have
new
matters,
that
i
never
presented
to
the
state
court,
the
federal
court
has
a
--
a
road
map.
ms.
katherine
burnett
yes.
ms.
katherine
burnett
if
implicit
in
your
question
is
--
yes,
implicit
in
your
question
is
that
the
petitioner
has
demonstrated
cause;
and
he
may
or
may
not
have
depending
on
the
facts.
ms.
katherine
burnett
it
may
be.
and
once
again,
that's
certainly
not
this
case.
ms.
katherine
burnett
right.
ms.
katherine
burnett
it
may
be.
ms.
katherine
burnett
and
that
may
--
and
that
may
very
well
constitute
an
external
impediment--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--to
him
being
able
to
present
it.
ms.
katherine
burnett
correct.
ms.
katherine
burnett
correct.
ms.
katherine
burnett
correct.
and--
ms.
katherine
burnett
--well,
i
think
then
you
get
--
that's
--
i
think
it's
actually
a
separate
matter.
we
first
have
to
get
to
whether
the
federal
court
can
look
at
a
new
matter
de
novo.
if
it
can
look
at
it
de
novo
then
i
think
we
go
to
the
pre-effective
death
penalty
act
law
about
when
you
have
a
hearing.
are
there
disputed
facts?
are
they
--
that
make
a
difference?
is
it
something
that
actually,
you
know,
needs
to
have
resolution
in
a
hearing?
ms.
katherine
burnett
i
think
it
can
happen,
certainly.
i
don't
think
it's
restricted
just
to
brady.
i
mean,
i
think
that
it
--
it
is
--
it
is
the
same
analysis,
no
matter
what
the
claim
is,
it's
the
same
analysis
that
the
federal
court
needs
to
go
through
to
look
--
to
see
whether
it
can
consider
new
matter.
ms.
katherine
burnett
i
think
it's
certainly
possible.
i
think
that
the
statutory
setup
and
this
court's
established
habeas
procedures
that
it
had
in
place
for
decades
permits
that.
ms.
katherine
burnett
well,
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
in
fact,
the
state
court
--
we
don't
have
to
provide
for
direct
appeals.
ms.
katherine
burnett
right.
and
all
i
can
say
to
that,
justice
scalia,
is
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
constitution
applies
anywhere
after
the
direct
appeal,
and
that's
only
the
right
to
cancel.
ms.
katherine
burnett
yes,
your
honor.
and
as
a
collateral
review;
that's
where
they
are
closing
the
gate,
not
on
direct
review.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
simply
ask
to
affirm.
