i
didn't
hear
the
--
the
last
part.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
virginia
supreme
court,
on
habeas,
said
we
are
going
to
accept
as
true
all
the
facts
as
the
petitioner
alleged
them.
they
said
specifically
"all
facts
alleged
in
the
petition
will
be
taken
as
true.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
said
they
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
get
the
diligence
part
because
the
whole
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
is
the
client
isn't
expected
to
do
any
of
this;
it's
counsel
that's
been
ineffective.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
it
doesn't
translate
into
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
because
the
client
is
not
the
one
--
the
lawyer
has
been
--
has
not
been
diligent,
but
there
is
nothing
that
the
client
could
do.
i
just
don't
see
how--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
you
could
talk
about
the
diligent
--
the
diligent
client
bringing
up
the
ineffectiveness
of
his
lawyer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
use
the
--
to
say
that
it's
a
new
claim,
because
that's
what
it
has
to
be,
right,
but
it's
such
an
extraordinary
use
of
"claim".
i
mean,
we
have
exhibit
cases,
the
notion
is
a
claim,
is
a
tort
claim
or
a
contract
claim,
but
not
additional
evidence
in
support
of
the
basic
claim.
the
basic
claim
is
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
that
what
it
was
saying
is
there
is
legitimate
--
this
is
a
strickland
question.
strickland
has
two
parts.
part
a
is
were
counsel
inadequate;
and
part
b
is
did
it
make
any
difference?
it
seemed
to
me
the
district
court
was
just
making
a
straight
out
strickland
determination
and
not
deferring
to
anything
else.
it
was
just
saying
no,
i've
looked
at
all
the
evidence,
and
yes
--
they
certainly
were
--
they
were
not
effective.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
no
prejudice
because
using
the
strict
strickland
test,
there
was
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
a
jury
would
have
come
out
differently.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
about
the
point
that
mr.
bress
made
that
there
wasn't
enough
time
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
on
habeas
to
develop
everything
that
was
later
put
before
the
district
court;
that
there
was
a
very
short
time
to
get
the
petition
in,
and
there
were
many
issues
other
than
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
she
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--she
answered
--
the
answer
that
i
wrote
is
the
same
thing
that
you
could
have
on
the
brady
claim
you
could
also
have
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
it's
a
wholly
new
matter.
i
thought
that's
what
she
said.
