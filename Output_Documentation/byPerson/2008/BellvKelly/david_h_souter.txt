justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
what
specifically
did
they--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
bress,
may
i
ask
you
a
question--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
which
sort
of
goes
to
the
utility
of
raising
that
issue
here,
and
it's
a
preliminary,
not
a
doctrinal
question.
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--my
understanding
is
that
in
the
united
states
district
court
on
the
federal
habe
--
the
district
court
made
a
--
drew
a
conclusion
based
on
the
evidence
before
it,
no
deference
to
the
state
court,
that
in
fact
your
client
did
not
demonstrate
prejudice.
and
my
understanding
is
that
that
--
although
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
rely
upon
that,
my
understanding
is
that
that
--
that
finding
remains
undisturbed.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
that
may
be.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
you
didn't
have
a
fourth
circuit
question.
i
--
i
guess
i
was
raising
a
question
to
whether
it
is
wise
to
make
this
the
case
to
decide
the
fourth
circuit
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
ask
one
quick
question?
the
--
the
answer,
i
take
it,
on
--
based
on
what
you
just
said,
the
answer
to
the
--
the
needto-exhaust
point
is
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
because
you
already
tried
to
exhaust
in
the
state
court,
and
they
didn't
give
you
enough
time
to
get
your
evidence
in.
that
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
did
he
make
any
request
from
the
state
court
for
more
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
your
brother
is
nodding
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
had
--
if
we
had
--
and
i
--
i
emphasize
i'm
--
i'm
not
suggesting
this
is
your
case.
but
if
we
had
a
case
in
which
with
respect
to
the
disputed
issue
he
had
asked
for
more
time
--
i'll
make
it
easy.
he
had
asked
for
more
time
and
--
and
had
--
had
indicated
that
there
were
leads
that
needed
to
be
followed
that
couldn't
be
followed
unless
he
got
more
time
and
so
on,
and
the
state
court
refused.
could
he
then
come
into
the
federal
court
and
say:
my
claim
here
is
not
only
ineffective
assistance,
but
ineffective
assistance
with
the
overlay
of
the
refusal
of
the
state
courts
to
give
me
an
adequate
opportunity
to
develop
my
--
my
ineffective
assistance
claim?
and
if
he
made
a
colorable
showing
on
those
two
issues,
would
he
then
have
an
opportunity
for
a
federal
evidentiary
issue,
and
would
the
findings
that
eventuated
from
that
be
subject
to
--
in
effect,
to
--
to
being
short-circuited
by
deference
to
the
state
court
findings?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you
don't
--
i
guess
what
i'm
getting
at
is
if
we
don't
in
that
circumstance
recognize
that
there
is
a
legitimately
different
claim
which
is
not,
for
the
reason
i
suggested
to
mr.
bress,
not
subject
to
further
exhaustion
requirements
because
they
tried
and
the
state
court
wouldn't
let
them
do
it
--
if
we
don't
in
that
case
recognize
that
there
is
a
claim
that
can
be
litigated
in
the
federal
court,
which
will
not
be
subject
to
deference
to
state
court
findings,
then
there
is
a
very
clear
hole
in
the
law,
and
i
assume
congress
didn't
mean
to
leave
it.
i
understand
you're
saying
that
is
not
this
case.
but
isn't
that
a
legitimate
problem
to
--
to
face
at
some
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
you're
right
in
the
main.
i
think
that's
generally
correct.
the
case
that
i'm
concerned
with
is
the
case
of
the
--
of
the
brady
claim,
because
if
we
are
proceeding
under
(e)
then
as
i
understand
the
cause
and
prejudice
can
only
be
established
in
the
case
we
are
talking
about
if
there
can
be
shown
a
probability
of
a
different
verdict.
the
brady
standard,
however,
does
not
require
the
probability
of
a
different
verdict.
brady
uses
the
term
"reasonable
probability
that
there
would
have
been
a
different
result.
"
but
that
has
been
clearly
defined
in
the
cases
to
mean
reasonable
possibility.
so
that
in
fact
with
respect
to
brady
claims
subsection
(e)
is
imposing
a
higher
requirement
than
brady
did
and
a
higher
requirement
than
would
have
been
applied
before
brady.
and
that
is
the
case,
it
seems
to
me,
that
we
--
it
may
not
be
this
case,
but
that's
the
case
that
we've
got
to
be
concerned
about
in
coming
up
with
doctrine
here.
isn't
that
a
legitimate
concern?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
don't,
i
don't
think
this
court
understood
the
implication
of
it
when
you
get
into
the
brady
issue.
and
my
only
concern
is
we've
got
to
leave
that
door
open
because
i
don't
think
williams
confronted
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
understand
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
now
--
but
the
road
map
that
you
are
now
saying
could
be
followed
is
the
same
road
map
implied
by
--
in
your
earlier
answer
to
justice
scalia,
your
reference
to
the
new
claim
as
being
a
defaulted
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
are
concerned
--
i
think
we
are
all
concerned
with
the
--
with
the
claim
in
which
it
is
not
defaulted,
in
the
sense
that
he
is
at
fault
in
any
way
for
failing
to
get
it
into
the
federal
court
--
i'm
sorry
--
get
his
entire
presentation
now
into
the
state
court
then.
so
that
it
is
not
a
defaulted
claim
in
the
classic
sense.
it
is
not
a
claim
in
which
he
is
at
fault
by
having
failed
to
present
it
in
the
state
court.
and
in
that
case,
if
it
cannot
go
back,
if
the
state
court
will
not
take
it
back,
don't
we
have
to
find
at
least
implicit
in
the
totality
of
subsections
(d)
and
(e)
the
possibility
of
litigating
the
--
the
fully
developed
claim
in
the
federal
court
without
a
need
to
defer
to
the
state
court
findings?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
--
i
agree
with
you
on
the
--
on
the
cause
part;
but
the
--
up
to
this
point.
he
has
got
to
demonstrate
cause
and
prejudice
or
at
least
he
has
got
to
develop
cause.
let
me
put
it
--
ask
you
this
question.
if
he
simply
says
look,
i
tried
to
get
this
in
to
the
state
court,
and
he
shows
that,
but
the
state
court
for
whatever
reason
just
would
not
take
the
evidence
that
he
wanted
to
put
in,
is
that
enough
for
him
to
have--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
--
i'm
not
asking
to
you
stipulate--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
it's
this
case.
but
it's
the
case
we
are
worried
about
around
the
corner.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
is
--
this
court
--
that's
why
i'm
saying
it's
a
very
established
law
as
to
what
cause
is,
and
external
impediments.
i
mean,
this
court
has
many
cases
that
describe
that.
the
lower
courts
are
very
familiar
with
determining
that,
and
so
they
can
--
they
are
capable
to
making
that
determination
as
to
whether
the
federal
court
can
now
look
at
a
new
matter
whether
it's
a
new
claim
or--
--but
all
we
are
--
i
think
all
we
are
really
getting
at
is
that
there
are
different
kinds
of
new
matters.
there
are
some
new
matters
of
which
he
absolutely
knew
nothing
at
the
state
court
stage,
and
he
is
now
saying
don't
hold
that
against
me:
i.e.,
i'm
showing
cause
and
i'll
show
prejudice.
this
is
new
matter
that
he
did
or
potentially
know
about
and
tried
to
get
into,
and
under
our
hypothesis,
the
state
court
says
no,
i'm
not
going
to
hear
it,
or
i
won't
give
you
the
time,
whatever
the
case
may
be.
in
that
case,
isn't
it
--
don't
we
have
to
say
under
the
statute
all
he
has
got
to
show
is
cause
in
the
sense
that
he
tried
and
the
state
court
wouldn't
let
him?
in
order
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
materiality
standard,
really.
