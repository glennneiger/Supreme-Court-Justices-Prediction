mr.
richard
p.
bress
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
problem
at
the
heart
of
this
case
is
construing
subsections
(d)
and
(e)
of
28
u.s.c.
2254
together
in
a
way
that
makes
sense.
the
last
time
that
this
court
construed
those
two
provisions
together
was
in
michael
williams.
michael
williams
presented
a
different
issue.
but
we
believe
that
looking
at
how
michael
williams
would
play
out
with
a
small
change
in
the
facts
will
help
frame
the
issue
that's
before
the
court
today.
now,
as
the
court
recalls,
in
michael
williams
the
virginia
supreme
court
denied
williams
the
investigative
assistance
he
needed
in
order
to
help
develop
a
claim
based
on
his
suspicions
of
jury
misconduct.
he,
therefore,
didn't
make
the
claim
in
state
court.
on
--
in
federal
court
he
got
investigative
assistance;
and,
in
speaking
with
the
investigator,
two
of
the
jurors
referred
to
the
foreperson,
bonnie
stinette,
as
bonnie
minehart.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
no,
your
honor.
the
state
court
did
not
refuse
to
consider
evidence
proffered
to
it.
the
state
court
refused
to
permit
the
full
development
of
the
evidence.
and
it
--
i
mean
it
misled
the
court--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--the
state
court
refused
to
permit
the
evidence
to
be
fully
developed,
your
honor.
they
didn't
refuse
to
consider
evidence.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
specifically,
your
honor,
the
state
provided
120
days
to
develop
the
state
habeas
petition.
the
petitioners
during
that
time
developed
14
different
claims,
including
the
claim
that's
at
issue
here
today.
in
the
course
of
that
they
interviewed,
i
think,
11
different
witnesses.
for
the
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel
claim
they
got
affidavits.
they
also
interviewed
all
12
jurors
for
five
different
claims
of
juror
misconduct.
they
interviewed
five
different
witnesses
for
brady
claims,
et
cetera.
they
ran
out
of
time,
your
honor,
and
they
asked
the
court
for
more
time
on
repeated
occasions.
they
asked
the
court
to
investigate--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well,
your
honor,
if
you
read
it
that
way,
it
would
not,
but
i
don't
read
the
question
presented
that
way.
i
read
the
question
presented
to
present
the
question
of
when
the
district
court
properly
hears
evidence
after
a
finding
of
diligence
by
the
prisoner
and
holds
that
the
state
court
didn't
provide
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
that
prisoner
to
develop
the
facts
in
state
court,
that
where
the
evidence
is
important
the
--
the
district
court
may
consider
that
evidence,
rather
than
giving
deference
to
the
state
court.
and
giving
deference
to
the
state
court
is
not
even
on
the
table
any
longer
in
this
case.
it
was
--
what
the
fourth
circuit
did,
the
fourth
circuit
took
the
new
evidence
into
account
and
deferred
to
the
state
court
nonetheless.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
he
didn't
have
the
new
evidence,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
actually,
no,
he
couldn't,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i'm
sorry.
the
--
as
the
virginia
commonwealth
attorneys
point
out
in
their
amicus
brief,
there
is
a
rule
in
the
virginia
state
court
that
any
facts
not
set
out
in
the
habeas
petition
at
the
state
level
can't
be
brought
in
later.
he
wasn't
able
to
bring
the
facts
in
afterwards.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
no,
they
weren't,
your
honor.
there
were
three
categories
of
new
facts
or
new
evidence
that
came
in
on
federal
habeas.
and
if
i
may,
the
first
--
the
first
of
them
had
to
do
with
facts
that
undermined
the
state's
claim
of
aggravation.
the
state
relied
on
only
one
aggravating
factor.
that
was
future
dangerousness.
and
in
the
course
of
that,
in
developing
it,
their
number
one
emphasis
was
on
one
adjudicated
--
unadjudicated
bad
act,
and
this
was
a
story
told
by
billy
jo
swartz
about
an
alleged
horrific
assault
on
her
and
of
tracy
nicholson,
who
was
a
girlfriend
of
the
petitioner.
what
the
jury
didn't
know
at
the
time
was
that
both
tracy
and
her
mother,
who
were
there,
said
that
the
incident
did
not
occur,
that
there
was
no
assault
there,
and
billy
jo
swartz
was
a
liar.
now,
on
state
habeas,
joanne
did
submit
an
affidavit
and,
in
that
affidavit,
said
that
billy
jo
swartz
had
lied.
that
created
a
dispute
of
fact
at
the
state
level,
but
unfortunately
rather
than
hear
the
witnesses
to
determine
the
credibility
and
--
the
virginia
supreme
court
instead
decided
against
petitioner.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
it's
not
more
evidence,
your
honor;
it's
just
that
a
dispute
over
the
facts
where
credibility
is
at
issue
shouldn't
be
decided
on
the
papers.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
and
if
they
had
done
that,
your
honor,
i
think
that
we'd
be
in
a
different
position.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
they
said,
on
the
one
hand,
they
did,
and
yet,
on
the
other
hand,
when
they
were
looking,
for
example,
at
joanne
nicholson's
testimony,
they
said
she
could
have
been
effectively
impeached
by
other
statements
that
she
had
made,
that
in
their
household,
she
had
never
seen
bell
be
physically
abusive
to
her
daughter.
now,
joanne
nicholson
and
tracy
nicholson
have
said
throughout
that
he
was
never
physically
abusive
to
tracy.
the
supposed
impeachment
would
have
come
from
police
court
records
that
have
never
been
introduced
in
this
case.
so
the
virginia
supreme
court,
without
a
hearing,
just
said,
on
the
one
hand,
we
accept
these
facts
as
true
and,
on
the
other
hand,
even
though
joanne
nicholson
would
testify
that
this
event
never
occurred
that
way,
she
would
have
been
impeached
so
the
jury
wouldn't
have
believed
it.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i'd
like
to
answer
that
question,
justice
alito,
in
two
ways:
one
very
practical,
which
is
that
the
ninth
and
tenth
circuits
have
adopted
the
rule
that
we
advocated
for
years.
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit
have
adopted
that
rule
for
brady
claims,
and
we
haven't
seen
the
flood
that
supposedly
is
going
to
come
through
the
gates.
secondly,
on
a
more
theoretical
level,
for
someone
to
be
able
to
introduce
this
new
evidence
on
federal
habeas,
they
have
to
first
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
they
were
diligent
in
attempting
to
formulate
it
in
the
state
court.
second,
they've
got
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
it's
important
and
importantly
changes
the
overall
factual
mix.
now--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
i'm
referring
to
michael
williams,
which
talks
about
diligence
by
the
state
habeas
counsel.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--your
honor,
we
understand
and
appreciate
the
diligence
of
habeas
counsel
is
not
any
kind
of
excuse
and
can't
be
--
statutorily
it
can't
be,
actually
under
2554,
but
what
we
are
talking
about
is
whether
the
prisoner
and
his
counsel
were
diligent
in
seeking
to
develop
the
facts
for
their
claim
when
they
were
on
state
habeas.
that's
what
michael
williams
had
to
do
with
it.
michael
williams
equated
diligence
with
reasonable
efforts
and
said
that
the
contrary
would
be
negligence.
in
this
case
we've
got
a
finding
by
the
district
court
that
bell
and
his
lawyers
were
diligent
in
seeking
to
develop
their
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
at
state
habeas.
and
that's
what
allows
them
under
(e),
that's
what
says
that
they
didn't
fail
to
develop
the
evidence
under
(e)(2)
and
allows
them
to
go
through
the
gate
of
(e).
now,
in
order
to
get
here,
you
have
to
demonstrate
that
diligence.
you
also
have
to
demonstrate
that
you're
able
to
develop
new
facts
that
matter,
that
are
important,
that
are
significant.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
i
appreciate
that
it's
not
"claim"
as
it's
used
ordinarily
in
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
or
when
you're
talking
about
making
claims
in
that
sort
of
a
complaint.
however,
this
court,
including
an
opinion
--
banks
v.
dretke,
for
example,
talked
about
the
two
different
brady
claims
in
that
case
as
separate
claims,
even
though
they
were
withholdings
by
the
same
prosecutor.
more
closely
even,
in
michael
williams,
there
were
two
separate
withholdings
of
evidence
to
impeach
the
same
witness.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
okay,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
address
that.
i
think
that
that's
essentially
how
this
works
in
this
case.
what
the
district
--
what
the
district
court
did
here
is
it
first
made
a
finding
of
was
there
diligence?
because
it
has
to
do
that
under
michael
williams
to
even
take
the
next
step.
did
the
petitioner--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--right.
but
it
had
to
take
that
step.
and
it
had
to
take
that
step,
by
the
way,
of
course,
with
(d)
in
mind
as
well,
because
this
court
in
schriro
said
there
is
no
reason
to
have
hearing
if
it
is
separately
precluded
by
another
predicate.
in
schriro,
obviously,
it
was
the
refusal
to
--
to
allow
mitigating
evidence.
so
it
does
that.
then
it
determines
separately
under
townsend,
was
there
a
problem
in
state
court
that
--
did
you
have
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
and
if
you
can
prove
the
facts
that
you
state,
would
you
win,
and
so
those
allowed
the
court
the
discretion
to
hold
a
hearing.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well
this
couldn't
have
been
presented
in
the
state
court.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well
as
the
state
argued
below,
it
would
have
been
procedurally
deficient.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
your
honor,
according
to
the
warden
at
least,
in
this
case
if
you
took
let's
say
the
facts
of
banks
v
dretke,
which
this
court
decided,
where
when
you
were
in
front
of
the
state
court,
what
you
knew
was
that
the
girlfriend
of
the
prisoner
had
said
that
one
of
the
witnesses
was
particularly
close
to
law
enforcement,
and
on
that
basis
they
made
a
claim,
a
brady
claim
in
state
court.
it
was
denied
because
it
wasn't
factually
developed
enough,
all
right?
so
they
went
to
federal
court
and
in
federal
court
they
got
a
lot
more
evidence
that
supported
that
claim.
they
actually
found
out
that
in
fact
this
person
was
a
government
informant,
and
on
that
basis
this
court
found
cause
and
prejudice
and
addressed
that
that
claim--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--well,
that's
absolutely
true
here
as
well,
your
honor,
the
state
statute--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--the
state
statute
is
unequivocal.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
there
is
no
exception
here
in
virginia.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
not
in
this
sort
of
a
claim.
no,
your
honor,
there
isn't.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
if
it's
the
same
claim
for
2254(d)
purposes,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
the
fourth
circuit
viewed
this
as
the
same
claim
and
that's
the
root
of
some
of
our
disagreement
with
them.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor.
we
would
agree
that
that
--
that
interim
solution
is
not
a
plausible
solution,
so
we
would
agree
with
that,
on
the
new
evidence--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--no,
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
we
also
argued
on
separate
grounds
where
the
state's
procedure
is
inadequate,
then
the
--
the
state's
application
of
--
of
federal
law
would
have
been
unreasonable.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
and
if
that's
true--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--sure.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
what
the
district
court
found,
as
the
fourth
circuit
saw
it
and
as
we
see
it,
was
that
the
state
court's
finding
of
prejudice
was
not
unreasonable.
now,
i
acknowledge
that
when
you
read
the
district
court's
oral
ruling
you
won't
see
a
reference
to
2254(d).
mr.
richard
p.
bress
however,
when
you
look
at
what
the
state
court
wrote
in
its
written
ruling,
what
it
says
is
there
is
a
colorable
claim
that
the
state
court
was
unreasonable,
on
--
in
application
of
law
to
the
facts
and
development
of
the
facts,
and
then
it
said
that
they
will
--
that
the
court
would
not
decide
this
issue
yet,
until
it
has
a
hearing;
and
so
the
fourth
circuit
looked
at
what
the
district
court
wrote
and
presumed
that
consistent
with
what
it
had
written,
it
then
confronted
this
issue,
the
issue
of
reasonability,
orally;
and
it
didn't
require
that
when
a
judge
is
saying
something
orally,
as
opposed
to
putting
it
in
a
written
opinion,
that
it
dot
every
i
and
cross
every
t.
it
assumed
that
it
meant
what
it
had
said
earlier.
if
this
court
has
any
doubt
about
that,
however,
it
could
certainly
remand
with
instructions.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
consistent
with
the
fourth
circuit,
we
don't
read
him
to
say
that.
but
even
if
he
meant
that,
the
fourth
circuit
certainly
on
--
looked
at
this
from
a
reasonableness
standpoint,
and
not
from
a
de
novo
standpoint.
so
even
had
the
district
court
meant
a
de
novo
review
and
engaged
in
it,
we
still
didn't
get
the
correct
standard
or
review
on
appeal.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
if
i
may
return
to
the
chief
judge's
--
chief
justice's
question
from
earlier,
there
are
other
new
claims,
new
facts
here
that
are
equally
important
in
deciding
whether
this
is
a
new
claim.
for
example,
physical
child
abuse
first
came
into
this
case,
and
really
was
first
discovered--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--mr.
chief
justice,
two
responses
to
this.
number
one
--
and
you
know,
as
i've
said
before,
this
court
has
used
claim
i
think
in
similar
ways.
it
may
have
been
colloquial
but
it
at
least
demonstrates
that
it
can
use
it.
i'm
not
saying
it's
the
most
normal,
or
the
ordinary
course
definition,
but
i
am
saying
that
it's
the
definition
that's
necessary
to
read
(d)
and
(e)
together
in
a
way
that
makes
sense;
and
if
i
can
just
explain
why
i
think
that's
true.
if
you
look
at
(e),
(e)
says
that
you
can
get
a
hearing
even
if
you
weren't
diligent
in
state
court,
if
the
facts
that
you
need
to
develop
were
not
reasonably
available
in
state
court
and
if
they
would
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
you
are
innocent.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
if
what
they
are
talking
about
is
--
if
that
includes
the
ability
when
you
are
in
state
court
--
assume,
for
instance,
house
versus
bell,
just
if
can
take
that
as
an
example.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i
don't
know,
but
if
we
can
--
if
we
can
just
look
at
the
facts
of
that
case
briefly:
assume
that
in
state
court,
despite
diligent
a
effort,
they
were
able
to
come
up
with
some
of
the
evidence
but
not
all
of
the
evidence
that
they
later
came
up
with
in
terms
of
the
blood
spattering,
the
dna,
and
such.
their
claim
is
denied
on
the
--
on
the
merits
because
they
weren't
able
to
get
much
of
the
evidence
in
and
denied
in
state
courts.
they
couldn't
go
to
federal
courts
where
they
were
able
to
bring
in
all
of
that
evidence,
and
let's
say
even
more,
enough
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
they
were
innocent.
under
the
warden's
view,
you'd
still
go
back
to
the
state
court
opinion
and
decide
whether
it
was
intrinsically
reasonable.
and
so
long
as
it
is,
you
wouldn't
--
the
state
court
gets
affirmed,
and
none
of
that
new
evidence
of
innocence
comes
in.
now,
i
guess
it's
a
possible
solution,
but
the
question
is:
is
that
what
congress
really
intended
here?
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--i
--
i
think
that
in
--
in
that
case,
by
the
way,
you
still
have
to
defer
to
the
state
factfinding.
i
think
you
always
have
to
when
the
state
determines
particular
facts.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
i
think
that,
again,
you
have
to
defer
under
(e)(1)
presumably
to
particular
fact
findings
and
find
that
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
you've
disproved
those
facts.
but,
otherwise,
i
don't
think
you
could
find
the
application
of
law
to
fact.
i
don't
think
you
can
under
holland,
et
cetera.
now,
you
know,
just
to
make
this
a
little
bit
clearer,
hopefully,
in
--
in
keeney,
upon
which
this
court
drew
in
michael
williams,
the
court
looked
--
the
court
did
--
looked
at
a
potential
distinction
between
the
failure
properly
to
make
a
claim
in
state
court
and
the
failure
properly
to
develop
the
facts
for
that
claim.
now,
the
court
looked
at
that
distinction
in
the
context
of
seeing
whether
cause
and
prejudice,
which
applied
to
the
failure
to
make
a
claim
in
the
state
court,
should
apply
to
the
failure
to
fully
develop
it.
and
what
it
said
is
that
distinguishing
between
those
two
circumstances
is
irrational.
now,
i
would
submit
that
it's
similarly
irrational
to
attribute
to
congress
the
intent
to
distinguish
between
the
circumstances,
or
because
of
these
limitations
you
have
in
state
court,
despite
your
effort,
you
weren't
able
to
fully
develop
the
record.
and
the
state
decided
the
case
on
an
inadequate
record.
it
comes
to
federal
court.
do
you
simply
defer?
i
mean
do
you
simply
stop
when
you
say
the
state
court
reasonably
decided
this
case
based
on
an
inadequate
state
court
record,
or
do
you
allow
that
record
to
be
fully
developed
and
decide
it
on
its
merits?
that's,
i
think,
the
issue
that
we
are
presenting
today.
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--that's
precisely
it,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i'd
like
to
start
where--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--i'd
like
to
start
where
the
general
left
off.
in
mcneal
and
claudy,
this
court
did
hold
that,
in
certain
instances,
a
state
habeas
court
must
hold
a
hearing
if
there
are
facts
in
dispute
and
they
are
not
willing
to
assume
them.
i
agree
that
a
state
doesn't
have
to
have
a
proceeding
at
all,
but
if
it
has
one,
it
has
to
be
fair.
i
know
that
my
time
is
short.
i'd
like
to
go
through
some
of
the
questions
you've
asked.
the
state
did
deny
us
additional
time,
expert
assistance
discovery,
and
a
hearing
in
this
case.
the
federal
court
specifically
found
that
we
were
diligent.
that's
at
84a.
and
in
michael
williams,
this
court
said
that
the
finding
of
diligence
also
constituted
a
finding
of
cause
for
purposes
of
cause
and
prejudice,
which
makes
sense
because
you've
got
a
prisoner
who
has
done
the
most
they
can
and
yet
hasn't
been
able
to
fully
develop
the
record.
there
was
no
external
impediment.
as
you'll
recall,
in
michael
williams,
the
information
was
there;
it
was
just
very
hard
to
find.
finally,
we
presented
very
substantial
new
evidence
on
the
federal
level
here.
it's
simply
not
true
that
there
is
no
new
evidence.
the
new
evidence
included
evidence
undermining
the
sole
aggravating
factor,
both
the
live
testimony
of
joanne
nicholson,
which
allowed
the
court
actually
to
determine
whether
she
would
have
been
a
credible
person
to
undermine
the
testimony.
the
state
had
held
on
the
papers
she
wasn't
credible,
which
the
state
can't
do
on
the
papers.
secondly,
the
evidence
said
he
was
physically
abused
as
a
child.
he
was
beaten
with
electrical
cords,
with
planks,
with
a
belt,
leaving
the
scars
on
his
body
that
he
bears
today.
he
saw
his
father
knock
his
mother's
teeth
out
for
trying
to
protect
him.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
i
think
the
test
really
ought
to
be
whether
an
objectively
reasonable
jurist
could
find
it
important
in
the
overall
mix
of
information.
and
it
just
strikes
me
that,
if
you're
the
judge
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
what
you're
going
to
go
through
is
--
if
i
accept
that
the
state
court
was
right
with
the
evidence
that
it
had
and
i
sort
of
put
myself
in
that
frame,
would
i,
nonetheless,
if
i
were
that
state
court,
have
found
this
evidence
important
when
i'm
making
this
decision?
mr.
richard
p.
bress
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
has
to
be
that
way,
your
honor.
i
think
you
can
have
a
case
where
the
evidence
that
was
before
them
was
absolutely
nil;
now
they're
offering
a
good
bit
of
evidence
that
you
would
at
least
want
to
weigh
as
an
objective
jurist,
even
though
you
decide
against
them.
i
think
that's
possible.
i
think
the
reason
you've
got
to
adopt
this
position,
however,
is
that
there
is
no
dna
--
i
mean,
no
innocence
exception
that
the
general
has
put
forward.
if
the
general
is
right,
it
isn't
a
new
claim
just
because
you
now
have
dna
evidence
that
proves
you're
innocent.
you
made
that
claim
of
innocence
earlier
in
the
proceeding,
in
your
earlier
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
what
you
have
new
now
is
you've
got
the
dna
evidence.
in
her
view,
it's
the
same
claim.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
and
i
agree
completely,
your
honor,
that
(e)
says
you
can
hear
it,
but
the
attorney
general
says
you
can't
because
under
(d),
she'd
say,
you'd
already
be
foreclose
because
the
state
court
has
already
adjudicated
your
claim
on
the
merits--
mr.
richard
p.
bress
--and
these
new
facts
don't
count.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
your
honor,
i
think
she
said
that
what
you
would
have
to
look
for,
i
think,
is
whether
"wholly
new
matter"
means
"new
evidence".
if
she
says
it's
new
evidence,
such
as
new
dna
evidence,
we
agree
completely.
that's
not
what
she
said
previously
in
this
case.
previously,
she
had
said
that
new
evidence
in
that
sense,
like
dna
evidence,
can't
make
that
claim
a
new
claim
and,
therefore,
you're
foreclosed
under
2254(d),
so
long
as
the
state
court's
opinion
is
intrinsically
reasonable
based
on
its
inadequate
record.
mr.
richard
p.
bress
well,
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
thought--
