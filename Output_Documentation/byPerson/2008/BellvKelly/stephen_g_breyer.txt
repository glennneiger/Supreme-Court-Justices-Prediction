justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
how
the
statute
works.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
way
it's
supposed
to
work
--
have
you
read,
by
the
way,
the
facts
of
the
case
for
december
in
bell
v.
cohen?
no?
okay.
forget
that.
i
was
going
to
shorthand
that
because
it's
similar
to
the
hypothetical
i'm
thinking
of.
what
happens
is
that
the
--
the
state
court
now
says,
okay,
i
assume
all
the
facts
in
your
favor
and
you
don't
prevail.
all
right.
now,
he
goes
into
federal
court
and
he
has
some
new
facts.
now,
either
they
are
such
that
they
transform
the
claim
and
it's
a
new
claim.
i
mean,
in
that
case
there
is
an
argument
for
that,
maybe
not
in
yours,
or
they
aren't.
now,
if
they
aren't,
then
what
he
is
supposed
to
do,
the
judge,
is
go
look
and
decide
on
the
basis
of
what
they
presented
to
the
state.
that's
the
end
of
it.
now,
if
they
are,
he
is
supposed
to
exhaust.
you
go
back,
you
exhaust
this
new
claim
like
any
other
new
claim,
and
if
the
state
bars
it,
then
you
go
and
see
if
there
was
cause
and
prejudice.
and
that's
how
it's
supposed
to
work.
and
if
there
was
cause
and
prejudice,
then
you
have
the
hearing.
okay?
that's
how
it's
supposed
to
work
factually.
i
have
no
idea
if
that's
what
went
on
here,
but
if
it
--
it
didn't
seem
to
me
--
there
was
some
confusion
about
whether
the
procedures
are
adequate
in
the
state.
then
there
is
some
other
thing
that
this
might
be
the
same
claim.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
we
get
to
the
question
we
took
this
case
to
decide,
frankly,
without
knowing
what
the
basis
was
and
whether
it
was
correct
for
the
district
court
to
give
him
any
hearing
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
first
step.
the
first
step,
i'd
go
and
see
--
but
at
any
rate,
you
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
wouldn't
you
say
right
off
the
bat,
new
claim,
go
present
it
to
the
state
court,
and
exhausts
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
suppose
we
have
--
that's
what
i
want,
not
these
facts,
but
i
want
the
facts
where
really,
he
couldn't
have
discovered
this,
because
the
first
time
that
the
district
attorney
opened
his
files
for
the
brady
claim
was
140
days
after.
so
we
now
have
some
totally
new,
which
he
couldn't
have
gotten;
no
one
disputes
it.
where,
that
kind
of
thing
--
i
think
he
would
have
to
present
it
to
the
state
court,
wouldn't
he?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
must
have
been
assuming
then
that
the
state
would
not
give
that
person
a
--
a
new
opportunity
to
consider
the
new
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
it
were
really
new.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
so
is
it
in
tennessee,
and
in
tennessee
there
is
an
exception
where
you
could
bring
the
thing
up
because
you
couldn't
possibly
have
gotten
hold
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
virginia
a
person
discovers
for
the
first
time,
140
days
later
looks
at
the
d.a.'s
files,
and
discovers
something
that
shows
the
whole
trial
was
a
farce
--
i
mean,
something
unbelievable,
and
there
is
no
way
for
the
person
under
virginia
law
to
bring
that
up
in
a
state
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
might
say
the
new
claim
--
okay,
so
it's
a
new
claim.
i
don't
know
if
yours
is,
by
the
way,
but
suppose
it's
a
new
claim.
then
what
you
ought
to
do
is
go
back
to
the
state
court
and
exhaust.
so
now
what
you
show
is
that
that's
futile.
now
we
get
to
your
question
before
us.
okay.
so
it's
an
imaginary
case.
it's
less
imaginary
in
december
than
here.
but,
anyway,
the
--
the
--
you
get
back
to
the
state
court.
now,
what
is
supposed
to
happen?
at
that
point
i
guess
the
statute
leaves
the
judge
free
to
develop
the
facts.
it
doesn't
say
you
can't.
so
then
you
do
it.
now
we
have
the
question,
which
when
we
took
this
we
thought
we
could
reach,
but
i
don't
know
if
we
can
--
now
we
have
the
question:
when
the
judge
makes
the
decision
on
the
basis
of
those
facts,
if
they
have
never
developed
any
of
this
in
state
court,
fine.
then
have
--
then
just
do
it
as
if
it
were
a
regular
case,
don't
defer
it.
but
suppose
some
of
the
things
have
been
in
state
court
related
to
this
but
not
others.
now
what
do
we
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
that's
not
an
obvious
answer
to
that
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
it's
going
to
do
is
it's
going
to
be
finding
facts
on
the
basis
of
certain
evidence.
and
what
you
will
have
gotten
your
new
claim
granted
on
is
the
fact
that
you
found
some
new
evidence
that's
very
significant,
and
you
couldn't
possibly
have
found
it
before.
now
what
do
we
do?
do
we
defer
in
part;
do
we
defer
--
i
mean
now
what
does
the
district
judge
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
still
trying
to
understand
the
statute.
i
think
their
point
is
we
get
around
(d),
(d)
doesn't
bar
us
because
the
district
court
here,
the
federal
district
court,
found
that
it
was
an
unreasonable
determination
of
the
facts,
not
unreasonable
on
the
substance,
but
unreasonable
because
of
the
procedure.
in
other
words,
the
state
that
barred
this
evidence
was
having
an
unreasonable
procedure
and
therefore
the
determination
of
the
facts
is
unreasonable.
so
you're
saying
that
isn't
what
those
words
"unreasonable
determination
of
the
facts"
mean.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
you're
saying
that
(d)(2),
"unreasonable
determination
of
the
facts",
means
the
factual
outcome.
in
other
words,
if
the
factual
outcome
is
reasonable
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
procedures
are
inadequate;
is
that
your
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no?
i
thought
you
just
said
that
in
answer
to
justice
souter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
not
whether
their
procedures
are
correct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
that's
the
first
thing
we
have
to
decide
to
get
to
the
question.
if
your
wrong
on
that
--
and
i
doesn't
know
the
answer
to
it
--
if
you're
wrong
on
that,
then
they're
rid
of
(d).
so
they
say
then,
we're
rid
of
(e)
because
it
falls
within
(a)(2),
the
factual
predicate
and
due
diligence,
okay.
they
say
we
are
rid
of
(e)
because
of
that.
now,
how
they
get
around
capital
(b)
i'm
not
sure,
but
that
isn't
in
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
arguing
due
diligence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
(i).
you
mean
of
(e)(2)--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--(e)(2).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
we
also
get
--
they
get
around
that
because
they
say
the
due
diligence.
you
also
have
an
argument
about
how
(2)
applies.
and
if
you're
wrong
about
both
of
those
then
we
get
to
the
question,
which
would
be:
if
the
--
if
the
hearing's
properly
before
us
and
it's
a
new
claim
--
it's
also
saying
it's
a
new
claim
--
if
it's
a
new
claim
it
has
to
be
exhausted.
so
under
virginia
law,
under
virginia
law,
is
it
really
true
that
--
suppose,
not
this
case,
but
suppose
a
defendant
140
days
after
discovers
the
da
says,
makes
some
remark.
he
couldn't
have
known
about
it.
he
goes
to
a
special
file.
he
couldn't
have
found
out
about.
and
lo
and
behold,
it's
the
worst
thing
you
can
imagine,
and
you
can
imagine
some
pretty
bad
ones
but
this
is
even
worse.
now
under
virginia
law
are
you
--
is
it
your
view
that
virginia
courts
would
say
you're
out
of
luck,
good-bye?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
matter
what,
it's
goodbye?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
excuse?
even
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
are
right
about,
they
are
right
about
the
exhaustion
being
futile.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
time
he
discovers
dna
evidence
in
the
da's
file
that
shows
he
couldn't
have
done
it,
there
is
no
way
to
get
relief
under
virginia
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
in
state
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
then
they're
right
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
then
let
me
ask
you
on
the
merits.
if
he's
right
there
and
it's
exhaustion
and
it
really
was
a
new
claim,
then
wouldn't
we
apply
a
decision
that
does
not
defer
to
the
state
court,
because
after
all
the
state
court
never
heard
this
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
there
is
no
real
argument
between
the
two
of
you
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
issue
that
we
thought
was
presented.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there's
certainly
an
argument--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
it's
really
a
new
claim,
you're
going
to
say
they
applied--
