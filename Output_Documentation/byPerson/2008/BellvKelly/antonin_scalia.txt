justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
he
have
brought
that
new
evidence
to
the
attention
of
the
state
court
first?
why
wasn't
he
obliged
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
state
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
could
have
a
post-conviction
proceeding
in
the
state
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
state
habeas.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bress,
this
case
involves
section
2254(d),
right?
does
that
appear
somewhere
in
the
briefs?
it
would
be
nice
to
have
it
in
front
of
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
a
central
thing
the
case
is
about.
i
cannot
find
it
in
any
of
the
briefs.
appendix
to
the
petition
for
cert;
i
got
--
i
got
to
go
back
to
that.
don't
you
think
it's
important
enough
to
be
in
your
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
want
us
to
dispose
of
the
case
that
doesn't,
that
doesn't
do
that?
what
do
you
want
us
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
the
district
judge
in
light
of
the
new
evidence
decide
whether
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
was
--
would
have
been
reasonable
if
it
came
out
the
same
way,
including
this
new
evidence
in
the
--
in
the
consideration?
why
shouldn't
he
do
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it
could.
but
i'm
asking
whether
it
should.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
statute
certainly
contemplates
that
the
states
have
the
first--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
first
cut
at
this
thing,
right?
how
else
do
you
give
them
the
first
cut?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
federal
court
is
supposed
to
do
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
having
established
cause,
he
would
then
in
your
view
not
have
the
federal
court
decide
the
matter
de
novo.
but
the
only
question
before
the
federal
court
was
whether
there
was
in
addition
prejudice.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
to
say,
whether
--
but
for
the
error,
any
reasonable
factfinder
would
find
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
he
was
innocent--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
the
state
court
can
say,
you
know,
60
days
after
the
trial
is
--
is
doomsday.
no
more
new
evidence.
we
are
not
going
to
consider
anything
new
after
that,
even
if
you
find
brady
stuff
or
anything
else.
suppose
that's
unconstitutional
--
but
it
isn't.
i
mean,
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so
if
it's
not
unconstitutional,
then
you
just
provide
what
you
say,
that
the
district
court
sees
whether
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
the
case
would
have
come
out
the
other
way.
if
it
were
unconstitutional,
and
i
guess
this
is
what
is
sticking
in
our
craw
--
my
craw,
anyway
--
if
it
were
unconstitutional,
it
seems
to
me
there
ought
to
be
a
way
to
make
the
state
take
the
first
cut
at
it.
make
the
state
say
oh,
yes,
even
with
this
new
evidence
we
would
still
find
this
person
guilty;
and
then
in
federal
habeas
you
would
--
you
would
apply
the
deference
that
2254(d)
requires.
you'd
ask
whether
that
was
a
reasonable
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
fallacy
in
my
--
in
my
reasoning.
or
you're
saying
i
shouldn't
be
troubled
by
what
has
been
troubling
me,
namely
that
he
had
no
way
to
get
this
before
the
state
court.
they
are
entitled
to
close
--
close
the
gates?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
know,
it
does
read
--
2254(e)
--
it
does
read,
"a
factual
predicate
that
could
not
have
been
previously
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
"
that
sounds
like
exactly
what
you're
describing,
the
discovery
of
dna
evidence
you
didn't
know
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bress,
i
want
to
apologize
to
you
for
accusing
you
of
not
printing
2254(d)
and
(e)
in
your
brief.
you
indeed
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
grateful
for
your
not
throwing
it
in
my
teeth.
[laughter]
