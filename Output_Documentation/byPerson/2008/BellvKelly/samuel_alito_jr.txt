samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
bress,
before
we
get
into
that,
could
i
just
ask
you
a
threshold
question?
we
took
this
case
to
decide
a
question,
and
one
of
the
factual
predicates
of
the
question
is
that
the
state
court
refused
to
consider
certain
evidence.
and
i'm
puzzled
about
that.
what
was
the
evidence
that
the
state
court
--
do
you
say
that
the
state
court
refused
to
consider
evidence
that
was
proffered
to
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that
really
does
not
present
the
question
that
you
asked
the
court
to
decide.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
your
argument
is
dependent
on
the
proposition
that
the
claim
that
was
advanced
in
the
federal
habeas
proceeding
is
a
different
claim
from
a
claim
that
was
adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
the
state
court?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
that's
the
case,
i
don't
understand
why
your
adversary
is
not
correct
that
it
will
always
be
possible
in
capital
cases
for
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
that
has
been
adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
the
state
court
to
be
advanced
and
get
de
novo
review
in
federal
habeas,
where
every
aspect
of
the
defendant's
life
that
is
potentially
favorable
can
be
advanced
as
a
basis
for
mitigation.
you
know,
when
your
firm
with
all
of
its
expertise
and
resources
comes
into
the
case
at
the
federal
habeas
level,
will
it
not
always
be
the
case
that
you
will
be
able
to
find
some
additional
mitigation
evidence
and
then,
under
your
theory,
that
will
be
a
new
claim
and
it
well
get
de
novo
review?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
test
for
determining
whether
the
addition
of
new
evidence
is
sufficient
to
make
it
a
new
claim?
