chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-1223,
bell
versus
kelly.
mr.
bress.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
weren't
the
facts
merely
cumulative
evidence
of
his
claim
that
was
before
the
state
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
supports
my
suggestion,
which
is
that
the
evidence
was
cumulative.
there
was
a
dispute
on
that
issue.
there
was
evidence
on
both
sides.
and
now
you
say,
hey,
we've
got
more
evidence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
bress,
your
--
you're
argument
that
this
can't
be
brought
up
assumes
that
it
is
a
new
claim
rather
than
the
same
claim,
right?
because
if
it
were
just
the
same
claim
then
the
question
would
be
it
is
simply
cumulative
rather
than
new?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
and
i
guess
it
gets
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
we
usually
don't
consider
claims
different
if
there
is
just
new
evidence,
but
here
didn't
the
fourth
circuit
necessarily
determine
that
this
was
the
same
claim
in
deciding
to
defer
to
the
state
court
findings?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
fact
you
got
more
than
you
were
entitled
to,
because
it
did
look
at
the
new
evidence,
albeit
through
the
guise
of
deference,
but
it
shouldn't
have
even
looked
at
that
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
we
think
that
they
were
right
--
and
we
are,
i
think
we
are
getting
away
from
the
question
presented
--
if
we
agree
that
they
are
right,
that
this
is
the
same
claim
and
it's
just
additional
evidence,
then
you
lose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know,
but
they're
--
your
underlying
theory
is
that
if
you
get
a
lot
of
new
evidence,
that
somehow
changes
the
claim.
and
again,
i
think
justice
ginsburg
--
i'm
having
trouble
getting
my
arms
around
that,
and
particularly
since
it's
problematic
in
this
area
where
there
is
always
new
evidence.
you're
looking
at
someone's
childhood.
you
can
always
find
a
new
anecdote,
a
new
concern
going
either
way,
that
you
know,
this
was
unusual
because
he
was
a
good
child,
or
this
is
excused
because
he
had
such
a
bad
upbringing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right,
well
just
--
we've
got
two
but
just
to
stop
you
on
one.
the
fact
that
they
excuse
your
failure
to
raise
and
present
the
evidence
in
state
court
doesn't
mean
that
when
you
get
the
evidence
you
have
a
new
claim.
it
just
means
that
they
are
going
to
let
you
raise
a
claim
you
could
have
raised
before.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i've
gotten
over
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
bress.
ms.
burnett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
fourth
circuit
--
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you,
but
the
fourth
circuit
didn't
decide
that
question
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
it's
a
new
claim
if
it
is
one
on
which
you
would
have
prevailed,
but
it's
the
same
claim
if
the
result
would
be
the
same.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
