justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
so
i
understand
your
position
on
the
underlying
question
if
we
don't
dismiss.
am
i
correct
that
the
granting
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
based
on
a
showing
by
the
petitioner
that
he
failed
to
develop
facts
which
might
change
the
result?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
did
the
--
why
did
the
federal
court
grant
a
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
he
only
entitled
to
do
that
on
the
basis
of
a
showing
that
there
was
more
evidence
that
the
state
court
did
not
consider?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
maybe
the
district
court
was
dead
wrong,
but
the
assumption
i
think
we
made
when
we
took
the
case
was
that
there
was
a
body
of
evidence
that
had
not
been
available
in
the
state
proceeding
that
might
be
available
in
the
federal
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that
were
true
--
i
know
you
disagree
with
that
and
i
understand
your
argument.
maybe
we
shouldn't
have
taken
the
case.
but
if
that
were
true
and
the
federal
court
then
had
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence,
do
you
read
the
statute
to
say
at
that
time
he
may
only
rely
on
the
evidence
presented
to
the
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
suppose
he
looked
at
the
state
court
evidence
and
he
says,
that
was
not
enough.
the
state
court's
decision
on
the
merits
was
reasonable
based
on
that
record.
i
have
a
different
record
before
me.
may
he
look
at
the
different
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
may
he
look
at
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
forget
the
cause
and
prejudice
for
just
a
moment.
but
if
he
looks
at
that
new
evidence
and
he
decides
that
any
neutral
judge
would
have
reached
a
different
result
from
the
state
judge
on
that
evidence,
may
he
reach
that
result?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
what's
the
point--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
you're
saying
is
the
correctness
of
decision
based
on
the
state
court
record.
and
if
he
decides
there
was
a
sound
decision
on
that
record,
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game;
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
the
same
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
seems
to
me
the
statute
has
constructed
a
pointless
procedure.
