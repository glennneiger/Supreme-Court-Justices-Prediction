justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
second
case
is
an
immigration
case,
an
immigration
that's
called
nijhawan
v.
holder.
immigration
law
permits
the
government
to
deport
an
alien
who
is
convicted
of
“aggravated
felony”.
and
there
is
a
related
statute,
there's
a
whole
lot
of
offenses
that
it
calls
aggravated
felonies.
it
defines
them.
and
one
on
that
long
list
is
“an
offense
that
involves
fraud
or
deceit
in
which
the
loss
to
the
victims
exceeds
$10,000.
the
question
here
is,
how
does
the
immigration
judge
decide,
whether
a
fraud
offense
of
which
an
alien
was
previously
convicted
involved
a
loss
to
the
victim
exceeding
$10,000?
does
he
just
have
to
look
at
the
fraud
statute
as
it's
described
in
the
statute
books?
let's
see,
for
example,
maybe
there's
a
monetary
threshold
there,
say,
defining
the
crime
as
applying
only
where
the
loss
is
greater
than
$10,000
or
$100,000
or
greater
than
a
million.
and
that
threshold
is
convicted
with
guarantee
that
the
fraud
involved
more
than
$10,000
because
it's
part
of
the
definition.
or
can
the
immigration
judge
also
look
to
the
proceedings
in
the
fraud
case
itself
to
determine
what
actually
happened?
that
matters
in
this
case.
that's
because
the
relevant
fraud
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
amounts.
it
doesn't
have
a
threat
to
show.
so,
if
we
just
read
the
statute,
we
can't
tell
whether
the
defendant
defrauded
the
victim
of
$5
or
$50,000.
but
we
do
know
from
the
record
in
the
particular
case
that
the
defendant
stipulated
its
sentencing
that
the
laws
from
his
fraud
exceeded
a
hundred
million
dollars
and
the
sentencing
judge
ordered
him
to
pay
$683
million
in
restitution.
we
decide
that
the
immigration
judge
can
look
beyond
the
statute.
and
in
this
case,
we
think
the
immigration
judge
was
right
to
look
at
the
sentencing
record.
there
are
so
few
fraud
crimes
defined
in
the
statute
books
as
containing
monetary
thresholds
than
to
hold
otherwise
as
the
defendant
wanted
us
to
do
would
lead
the
immigration
laws
fraud
provision
without
any
coherent
application.
moreover,
we
think
there's
sufficient
safeguards
for
those
threatened
with
deportation.
in
the
laws
requirement
that
the
government
at
the
deportation
proceeding
has
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
that
earlier
fraud
conviction
did
involve
a
loss
of
at
least
$10,000
or
more
and
the
government
must
tie
the
laws
to
a
specific
count
of
conviction.
we
explained
all
this
further
in
our
opinion.
we
affirmed
the
same
conclusion
reached
by
the
third
circuit
and
this
decision
is
unanimous.
