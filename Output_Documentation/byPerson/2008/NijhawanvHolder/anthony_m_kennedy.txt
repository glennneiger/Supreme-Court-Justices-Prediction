justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--under
the
time-honored
approach,
if
the
jury
verdict
necessarily
--
or
not
necessarily,
but
did
in
fact
refer
to
the
amount
involved
and
it
was
over
$10,000,
would
that
be
part
of
the
time-honored
approach
and
then
the
statute
would
be
fulfilled?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
that
connection,
at
some
point
in
the
argument
--
and
you
may
be
a
little
early
because
you're
talking
about
the
statute
--
i'd
like
to
know
either
anecdotally
from
your
experience
or
--
or
because
it's
written
somewhere,
how
often
do
juries
give
special
verdicts?
it
actually
applies
in
the
second
case
we're
to
hear
as
well.
and
has
that
changed
in
the
light
of
--
of
apprendi?
in
--
in
my
experience,
we
just
didn't
know
many
of
the
features
of
the
crime
from
--
from
the
jury
verdict,
and
i
just
would
like
to
know
if
that's
changed
in
this
day
and
age.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
may
reach
that
after
you've
talked
about
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
can
see
that
if
there
are
multiple
defendants
in
the
case,
some
of
the
defendants
might
say
that
this
is
unnecessary,
it's
inflammatory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
all
that
just
underscores
the
fact
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
why
would
you
be
reluctant
to
do
that?
would
you
just
spell
that
out
a
little
bit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
your
answer,
it's
your
first
argument,
it's
the
--
it's
the
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
for
blockburger
purposes
or
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
you
couldn't
retry
him
for
those
other
--
for
that
additional
loss,
then
that's
--
i
assume
your
argument
is
that
that's
included
within
the
offense
for
which
he
was
convicted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
position
is
that
in
ancillary,
subsequent
proceedings
anything
you
prove
that's
within
the
offense
convicted
--
say,
as
measured
by
double
jeopardy
purposes,
as
protection
against
multiple
prosecutions,
that
you
can
make
that
showing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
my
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
that
that's
your
whole
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
frankly
couldn't
understand
the
government's
concession
on
that
point.
i
thought
the
--
the
offense
on
illegal
entry
was
to
enter
illegally
after
you've
been
deported.
it's
a
--
there's
a
defense
if
the
original
deportation
was
flawed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
see.
