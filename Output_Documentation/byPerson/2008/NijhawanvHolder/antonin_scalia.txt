mr.
moseley--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
how
you
squeeze
your
--
your
modified
categorical
approach,
which
seems
to
be
a
deus
ex
machina
which
is
intended
to
blunt
the
government's
argument
that
very
few
statutes
would
be
covered
by
this.
i
don't
see
how
you
get
that
out
of
the
word
"convicted".
are
you
convicted
of
an
offense
involving
more
than
$10,000
if
in
a
separate
interrogatory
the
jury,
though
it
has
no
obligation
in
order
to
find
you
guilty
to
say
how
much
you
stole,
in
an
interrogatory
the
jury
says,
oh,
yes,
the
amount
was
more
than
$10,000?
does
that
cause
you
to
have
been
convicted
of
that?
you
are
convicted
of
what
you
are
charged
with.
you
are
convicted
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
not
--
not
of
whatever,
whatever
the
judge
chooses
to
allow
the
jury
to
be
questioned
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
earlier
--
your
earlier
assertion
that
it
was
necessary
to
--
that
--
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
get
that
--
that
amount
specified
for
sentencing
purposes
is
simply
not
true.
i
mean,
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
hold
that
the
guidelines
are
mandatory,
and
you
--
that
you
need
a
--
a
jury
determination.
we've
said
they
are
discretionary.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you
don't
have
a
jury
determination,
you
can
still
sentence
on
the
basis
of
the
amount
taken,
even
though
that
was
not
found
by
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
in
rebuttal
you'll
address
the
argument
about
deferring
to
the
agency's
finding
about
what
it
means.
we
usually
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
save
it
for
rebuttal.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
except
--
except
for
his
modified
hangout.
his
modified
--
his
modified
categorical
does
--
does
expand;
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
also
interrogatories
to
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
wouldn't
allow
that
exclusion
to
have
any
effect
on
deportation,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
--
i
--
i'm
losing
you.
i
would
--
i
would
have
thought
that
you
have
to
have
convicted
him
of
the
larger
scheme.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
didn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
would
--
i
thought
that
was
the
whole
case
we
had
before
us,
where
you
haven't
proved
either
as
an
element
or
--
or
by
a
separate
jury
finding
how
much
money
was
involved.
your
point
is
you
don't
have
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
establish
that
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
would
have
thought
you
would
not
accept
the
chief
justice's
premise,
that
a
crime
of
violence
is
an
aggravated
felony.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
how
you
read
the
language.
i
guess
--
i
guess
grammatically
it
could
be
read
either
way.
you
can
read
it:
an
offense
that
involves
fraud
or
deceit
in
which
--
in
which
the
loss
to
the
victim
exceeds
$10,000.
or
you
could
read
it:
convicted
of
an
offense
that
involves
fraud
or
deceit,
in
which
the
loss
to
the
victim
exceeds
$10,000.
i
mean,
"convicted"
doesn't
necessarily
apply
to
the
last
--
to
the
last
phrase.
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that's
basically
what
we're
arguing
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
come
back
to
the
deference
point,
you
say
--
is
this
relevant
to
the
criminal
conviction?
he's
convicted
criminally
regardless
of
how
you
read
that.
you
acknowledge
it
doesn't
--
it
isn't
an
element
of
the
crime,
and
so
to
be
convicted
criminally
you
acknowledge
you
don't
have
to
show
the
amount--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
in
that
later
criminal
proceeding,
they
would
have
to
prove
it
undoubtedly--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
this
is
not
a
later
criminal
proceeding;
this
is
an
administrative
proceeding.
and
why
shouldn't
it
be
up
to
the
bia
initially
to
determine
how
to
interpret
this
language
for
purposes
of
the
deportation
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
--
was
it
not
true
that
there
the
interpretation
placed
upon
the
statute
by
bia
would
also
be
the
interpretation
necessary
to
secure
the
criminal
conviction?
and
that's
not
the
case
here.
