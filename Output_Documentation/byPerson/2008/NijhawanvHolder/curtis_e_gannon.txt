mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
reading
of
subparagraph
(m)(i)
implausibly
excludes
the
mainstays
of
federal
fraud
prosecutions
and
applies
at
best
to
a
tiny
handful
of
outlying
offenses:
thefts
of
major
works
of
art,
extreme
cases
of
government
contract
fraud,
and
some
frauds
obtaining
confidential
phone
records
and--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
--
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
he
does
offer
this
--
this
variation
on
a
so-called
modified
categorical
approach
by
saying
that
we
could
use
extraneous
facts
in
guilty
pleas
in
order
to
satisfy
the
categorical
approach.
but
we
think
that
that
doesn't
work
for
both
practical
reasons
and
for
the
types
of
reasons
that
--
that
several
of
the
questions
raised
in
the
first
half
of
the
argument--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--he
does
seem
to
contemplate
that
interrogatories
for
the
jury
might
also
achieve
the
same
purpose.
but
as
justice
alito
was
pointing
out,
there
--
there
is
little
reason
to
believe
that
a
judge
is
going
to
permit
such
extraneous
questions
to
be
put
to
a
jury
that
are
--
that
are
not
necessary
for
the
criminal
proceeding
that
is
actually
being
held
at
that
point.
it's
unlikely
that
the
government
wants
to
make
the
entire
--
wants
to
imply
that
the
conviction
needs
to
turn
on
that.
and
obviously,
both
with
the
--
the
special
interrogatories
and
the
guilty
pleas,
there
are
practical
problems,
because
this
could
only
apply
prospectively,
even
though
congress's
definition
of
aggravated
felonies
is
intended
to
apply
to
convictions
that
predated
the
enactment
of
iirira.
it
--
i
just
mean
that
it
would
not
be
until
we
knew
that
this
was
the
rule,
that
we
could
implement
such
--
such
a
rule.
and
it's
not
clear
why
any
alien
who
would
be
contesting
his
removability
in
the
civil
removal
proceedings
would
concede
in
the
--
in
a
guilty
plea
or
to
a
fact
that
is
extraneous
to
that
conviction
that
would
ultimately--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
he
did
not
ask
the
judge
for
a
finding
of
loss.
he
--
he
asked
for
an
instruction
--
for
a
special
interrogatory
as
to
"the
amount
of
money
my
client
is
responsible
for.
"
that's
on
page
14a
of
his
opening
brief.
and
that's
not
the
relevant
question
for
purposes
of
the
loss
threshold
in
subparagraph
(m)(i),
which
is
actually
about
the
--
the
loss
to
the
victims
from
the
offense
involving
fraud
or
deceit,
not
how
much
any
individual
defendant
might
have
been
responsible
for.
and
even
now--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
and
at
that
point
he
--
he
--
we
--
we
presumably
wouldn't
want
to
have
to
prove
up
a
loss
at
that
point
that's
irrelevant
for
purposes
of
the
criminal
guilt
proceeding,
although
it
may
well
become
relevant
for
the
sentencing
proceeding,
as
it
did
become
relevant
here,
and
there
was
a
sentencing
stipulation.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
--
i
think
that
it
could
confuse
the
jury.
even
if
it
were
clear
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
a
determination
of
guilt,
that
would
be
a
particularly
odd
sort
of
bifurcation
to
thrust
upon
the
original
criminal
proceeding,
to
require
the
jury
to
make
findings
about
facts
that
are
truly
extraneous
to
the
purposes
of
the
criminal
proceeding
that
is
being
held
there,
and
for
--
at
least
for
guilt
purposes,
there
is
no
reason
for
the
jury
to
have
to
find
that.
and
as
--
as
the
questions
before
were
making
clear,
the
reason
this
court
has
applied
the
modified
categorical
approach
is
to
determine
what
is
necessary
for
the
underlying
conviction.
that's
why
it's
tied
to
an
investigation
into
what
really
were
the
elements
of
the
underlying
offense.
and
interrogatories
about
facts
that
were
not,
in
fact,
necessary
for
the
conviction
or
--
or
extraneous
facts
that
are
introduced
into
guilty
pleas
do
not
change
the
fact
that
that
particular
attribute
was
not
necessary
for
the
conviction.
and
so,
we
think
that
it
makes
sense,
in
context
of
the
other
definitions
in
paragraph
43
of
the
definition
of
aggravated
felonies,
where
it
is
indisputable
that
there
are
multiple
provisions
that
include
both
an
element
that
needs
to
be
evaluated
as
an
element
of
the
offense
and
some
other
limiting
factor
that
need
not
be
an
element
of
the
offense;
that
it
makes
sense
to
construe
the
loss
threshold
in
subparagraph
(m)(i)
as
something
that
need
not
be
an
element,
because
the
consequences
of
petitioner's
approach
would
be
to
read
out
virtually
all
federal
fraud
prosecutions,
including
such
mainstays
as
mail
fraud,
wire
fraud,
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
government,
bank
fraud,
the
offenses
that
were
at
issue
here.
and
he
does
offer
a
patchwork
of
some
state
offenses
that
could
be
satisfied.
but
even
there,
there
--
there's
not
any
particular
consistency
to
it.
he
invokes
the
model
penal
code,
which
has
a
gradation
scheme
for
theft
by
deception
offenses.
and
although
the
bia
has
--
has
acknowledged
that
theft
by
deception
offenses
may
in
certain
circumstances
constitute
fraud
offenses,
the
model
penal
code
does
not
in
the
next
chapter
dealing
with
forgery
and
fraudulent
practices
have
a
consistent
gradation
scheme.
so
even
in
the
states
that
petitioner
cites
in
his
reply
brief,
delaware
doesn't
have
monetary
thresholds
for
insurance
fraud,
even
though
it
does
for
health
care
fraud;
and
new
jersey
doesn't
have
monetary
thresholds
for
credit
card
fraud
or
payment
card
fraud,
and
so
a
million-dollar
fraud
would
not
be
--
would
not
be
treated
consistently,
depending
upon
which
state
it
was
committed
in
and
even
which
type
of
fraud
it
was
in
an
individual
state,
if
the
state--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yes,
we
think
that
it
is
not
necessarily
the
same
as
the
loss
determination
that
would
be
made
for
sentencing.
and
so,
the
board
has
made
it
very
clear
that
even
though
a
restitution
order,
for
example,
can
be
sufficient
evidence
of
loss
to
the
victim,
that
it
needs
to
be
assessed
with
an
eye
to
exactly
what
losses
were
determined
in
the
underlying
restitution
order
and
with
regard
to
the
burden
of
proof
there.
and
so--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that
the
text
of
the
statute
here
in
subparagraph
(m)(i)
talks
about
an
offense
that
involves
fraud
or
deceit
in
which
the
loss
to
the
victim
or
victims
exceeds
$10,000.
and
so,
we
think
that
the
loss
threshold
is
tied
to
the
offense
that
involves
fraud
or
deceit,
not
to
the
individual
defendant's
role.
if
he's
convicted
of
a
$10,000
fraud
or
in
this
case
what
may
well
have
been
a
$683
million
fraud,
he
is
--
that
--
that
is
the
offense
of
which
he
was
convicted,
and
it
is
an
offense
in
which
the
loss
to
the
victims
exceeded
$10,000.
and
so
we
think--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
in
general
the
--
the
judge
does
have
discretion
to
--
to
adjust
aspects
of
the
restitution
order
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
of
the
underlying
offense.
and
that's
--
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
think
the
board
has
been
sensitive
to
the
idea
that
the
restitution
order
does
not
necessarily
determine
what
the
amount
of
loss
is
going
to
be
for
purposes
of--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it
would
depend
upon
the
facts
of
the
underlying
case.
if
the
underlying
fraud
was
one
in
which
the
victims
lost
nor
than
$10,000
and
we
could
prove
that
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
in
the
removal
proceeding,
then
--
then
we
think
that
we
would
not
be
bound
by
the
judge's
discretionary
refusal
to
impose
a
restitution
requirement
on
the
particular
defendant.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
depending
upon
the
facts
of
the
case,
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
in
your
hypothetical
if
we
can
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
amount
of
loss
associated
with
a
fraud
offense
was
more
than
$10,000,
we
think
that
would
satisfy.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
yes.
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
not
a
pecuniary
gain
threshold.
it's
a
loss
to
the
victim
threshold.
and
--
and
although
the
judge
may
well
take
that
into
account
for
purposes
of
restitution,
it
doesn't
change
the
metric
that
congress
chose
to
determine
which
types
of
frauds
are
serious
enough
to
be
considered
aggravated
felonies.
in
1994,
they
--
they
picked
a
threshold
of
$200,000.
in
1996,
they
dropped
that
to
5
percent
of
that
value,
to
$10,000.
i
think
congress's
judgment
here
is
that
if
the
fraud
is
so
severe
that
it
--
that
--
that
somebody
--
that
the
victims
lost
$10,000,
then
--
then
that
is
a
qualifying
offense
for
purposes
of
subparagraph
(m)(i),
even
if
the
original
criminal
sentencing
judge,
on
the
basis
of
all
sorts
of
factors
associated
with
the
case
and
under
the
restitution
standards,
decided
that
the
defendant
was
not
necessarily
liable
to
pay
restitution
in
that
amount.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
--
i
think
that
we
are
not
taking
the
position
that
the
--
the
stipulation
for
sentencing
purposes,
which
was
pursuant
to
(6)(b)of
the
guidelines
and
was
for
stipulation
purposes
--
we're
not
arguing
that
that
is
--
is
dispositive
in
the
--
in
the
civil
removal
proceeding.
we're
arguing
that
it's
persuasive
evidence
of
the
amount
of
loss
here.
and
so,
he's
--
he
is
certainly
able
to
say
before
the
board
or
before
the
immigration
judge
that
--
that
for
some
reason
the
amount
that
he
admitted
to
isn't
really
the
--
the
actual
amount
of
loss
associated
with
the
case.
that's
not
what
he
has
done
here.
he
has
--
he
has
consistently
tried
to
establish
that
--
that
this
--
these
--
this
gargantuan
loss
amount
was
--
was
not
one
that
was
found
by
the
jury,
not
that
it
was
not
in
fact
the
loss
that
actually
accrued
in
association
with
the--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--not
necessarily,
justice
stevens.
if
the
conviction
was
for
the
entire
scheme,
then
we
could
bring
in
the
amounts
that
were
relevant
to
the
scheme.
but
if--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it's
possible.
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
exactly
what
we
could
determine
had
actually
been
associated
with
the
original--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
--
if
we
had
that
amount
of
evidence
in
this
case,
we
had
sentencing
stipulations
and
all
sorts
of
determinations
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
where
the
defendant
did
not
even
try
to
argue
that
this
wasn't
actually
the
amount
of
loss
associated
with
his
offense
and
conviction,
then
we
probably
would
be
able
to
establish
by
clear
and
convincing
that
the--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
--
i
thought,
justice
scalia,
that
that
was
the
premise
of
justice
stevens'
question.
that
that--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well
--
i
think
that
it's
unlikely
if
we
didn't
have
the
evidence
contemporaneous
with
the
trial.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
--
if
it
were
like
this,
we
had
the
evidence
contemporaneous
with
sentencing,
with
$100
million
stipulations
and
things
like
that,
and
that
makes
it
obviously
much
easier
for
us
to
prove
the
extent
of
the
underlying
fraud.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
if
--
if
that
were,
in
fact,
the
scope
of
the
conviction,
because
it
was
for
--
for
the
entire
fraudulent
scheme,
then
that
may
well
be
so.
obviously,
that
--
the
cases
that
have
applied
the
--
the
tethered
approach,
to
use
the
word
that
petitioners
invoked
here,
are
cases
in
which
the
--
the
courts
and
the
bia
have
recognized
that
sometimes
it
is
necessary
to
recognize
that
there's
a
distinction
between
what
the
defendant
actually
pleaded
guilty
to.
if
the
defendant
pleads
guilty
to
only
an
individual
account,
that's
involved
in
the
scheme--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well
i--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
--
in
those
circumstances
i
--
i
think
that
we
may
well
be
able
to
prove
that
in
the
second
proceeding.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yes,
that's
right,
justice
scalia,
and
as
long
as
it
is
the
scope
of
the
scheme
that
--
that
he
was
convicted--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yes,
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
as
long
as
the
offense
were
in
fact
the
scheme
rather
than
an
individual
instance
of
a
mailing,
that's
correct;
and
so
i
think
that
that
--
that
that
is
consistent
with
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
and
that
we
would
in
those
circumstances
be
able
to
--
attempts
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
in
the
civil
removal
proceedings
that
the
loss
associated
with
the
offense,
which
was
the
scheme
rather
than
just
an
individual
mailing,
then
--
then
we
would
be
able
to
prove
that.
given--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
with
--
here
it's
--
we're
not
trying
to
prove
a
separate
criminal
offense.
we're
trying
to
prove
that
the
offense--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yes.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
yes,
that
it
--
this
is
the
offense
of
conviction.
this
is
just
like
the
domestic
relationship
prong
of
the
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence
that
the
court
decided
in
its
recent
decision
in
united
states
v
hayes,
that
--
that
there
is
a
prior
conviction,
some
aspects
of
which
were
elements
of
the
underlying
offense,
and
in
order
to
establish
whether
the
prior
conviction
needs
the
statutory
definition
in
the
subsequent
proceeding,
the
government
will
need
to
bear
the
appropriate
burden
of
proof
for
that
proceeding.
whether
it's--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yes.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i
--
i
think
it
was
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
in
the
context
of
the
922(g)(9)
prosecution--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--because
that
was
itself
a
criminal
proceeding,
and
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
we
think
that
if
this
definition
were
--
were
to
be
applied
in
the
criminal
context,
then
we
would
need
to
prove
this
aspect,
the
loss
threshold.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
just
to
be
clear
it's
--
there's
already
a
10-year
statutory
maximum
that
applies
under
1326(b)(1)
for
the
prior
conviction
for
a
felony.
i
think
that's
something
that
can
easily
be
established
through
the
categorical
approach
and
we
would
not
need
to
have
a
1326
to
determine
it's
a
felony.
but
in
order
to
determine
that
it
is
an
aggravated
felony,
as
long
as
we
could
not
satisfy
through
a
categorical
approach
to
demonstrate
that
it
was
an
element
of
the
offense
in
the
original
proceeding,
then,
yes,
i
agree;
we
would
need
to
meet
the
relevant
burden
of
proof
in
the
1326(b)(2)
proceeding.
now,
as
it
happens,
this
--
the
extra
10-year
statutory
maximum
at
issue
in
1326(b)(2)
effectively
never
gets
litigated
because
the
sentencing
guidelines
arrange
for
aggravated
felony
enhancements
in
that
context
for
crimes
like
subparagraph
(m)(1),
ranges
from
21
months
on
the
low
end
with
no
criminal
history
to
57
months
on
the
high
end
with
criminal
history
of
6.
and
so
this
effectively
--
the
extra
10
years
of
statutory
range
is
never
employed
by
--
by
judges
for
these
types
of
crimes.
in
the
last
three
years,
according
to
sentencing
commission
data,
there
isn't
a
single
defendant
in
the
1326
proceeding
who
received
a
sentence
of
more
than
10
years
and
had
an
increase
on
the
basis
of
an
aggravated
felony
that
would
include
the
category
that
we're
dealing
with
here
in
subparagraph
(m)(1).
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
we
have
to
prove
for
purposes
of
the
relevant
proceeding
in
which
we're
trying
to
establish
that
it
is
an
aggravated
felony
that
it
also
exceeded
the
$10,000
threshold.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
no
more--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
we
would
need
to
prove
that
if
it
were
relevant
to
a
criminal
proceeding,
but
in
the
civil
removal
proceeding
those
protections
aren't
there.
and
so
we--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
several
other
statutes
here
that
have
extra
limiting
factors
that
are
necessary
to
make
the
crime
an
aggravated
one
for
purposes
of
the
aggravated
felony,
but
don't
have
to
be
proved
as
an
element
of
the
original
offense.
congress
has
established--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
but
for
many
of
the
offenses
it's
things
that
as
petitioner
acknowledges,
would
never
be
proved
as
elements
of
the
offense.
it's
the
notion
that
a
crime
of
violence
is
one
in
which
the
term
of
imprisonment
is
at
least
one
year.
there
are
other
ones
that
depend
on
the
actual
sentence
that
was
imposed.
there
is
a
second
or
subsequent
offense
that's
referred
to
in
subparagraph
(j);
there
is
an
exception
for
purely
political
offenses
from
the
definition
of
--
of
crime
of
violence.
there
are
affirmative
defenses--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--but
not
according
to
congress.
it
is
only
in
the
area,
if
it
is
not
a
purely
political
offense,
and
if
the
term
of
imprisonment
is
at
least
one
year.
and
so
by
definition,
it
already
can't
be
an
aggravated
felony
according
to
congress
if
it
doesn't
meet
other
factors
that
we
would
not
have
expected
the
original
jury
to
determine
as
an
element
of
the
original
crime
of
violence.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i'm
the
one
that's
sorry.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well
--
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
it's
--
it's
not
a
much
lighter
burden
in
the
sense
that
we
do,
for
purposes
of
the
civil
removal
proceeding,
need
to
establish
it
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
--
and
it
is,
in
--
in
a
subsequent
criminal
proceeding,
there
will
be
all
the
constitutional
protections
that
you're
talking
about,
just
like
the
domestic
relationship
prong
of
the
--
of
the
crime
that
the
court
considered
in
hayes.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
tried
to
explain
that
it
is
not
as
long
as
there
isn't
a
sentence
that
is
imposed
of
at
least
1
year
according
to
congress's
way
of
determining
what
is
an
aggravated
felony,
and
congress
has
determined
that--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
but
in
--
in
that
regard--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
no,
we
think
that
you
were
convicted
of
the
offense,
which
is
an
offense
that
involves
fraud
or
deceit,
and
then
there
is
the
further
limitation
that
congress
has
imposed,
not
as
an
element--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--but
it
--
it
can't
have
that
same
meaning
with
regard
to
all
of
these
other
things
in
all
of
these
other
offenses
in
which
congress
has
determined
they're
not
an
aggravated
felony
until
those
other
criteria
are
also
satisfied.
i
mean
--
so
we
think
that
in
a
statute
that
indisputably
involves
individual
offenses
that
have
both
elements
of
the
offense
and
nonelement
limiting
factors
in
order
to
limit
the
category
to
those
that
congress
would
have
deemed
to
be
aggravated,
that
it
makes
sense
to
not
have
to
find
as
an
element
of
the
offense
those
extra
factors
that
generally
wouldn't
be
for
most
of
the
other
provisions.
and
here
we
know
if
that
reading
is
imposed
on
this
statute,
that
it
reads
out
all
the
mainstays
of
federal
fraud
prosecutions
and
brings
in
a
haphazard
patchwork
of--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--and
we--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--and
we
think--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
for
purposes
of
a
civil
removal
proceeding,
that's
true,
and
that's
no
different
from
the
limiting
factors
in
several
of
the
other
provisions,
like
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
--
the
potential
sentence
--
whether
there
was
an
exception
for
a
first
offense
that
involved
family
members,
for
the
alien
smuggling
and
document
fraud,
crimes
in
(n)
and
(p).
and
the
--
this
also
is
a
reading
that
we
can't
impose
on
subparagraph
(m)(ii),
where
we
know
that
there
is
no
loss
requirement
there,
that
the
government
have
a
revenue
loss
of
more
than
$10,000
for
a
crime
in
which
the
loss
to
the
government
is
$10,000.
the
"in
whiches"
here
are
parallel
to
the
"for
whiches"
elsewhere
in
--
in
the
statute.
and
although
petitioner
invokes
the
guilty
plea
practice
in
the
context
of
tax
evasion
offenses
for
purposes
of
section
7201,
this
--
this
doesn't
help
his
argument
for
the
same
reason
that
he
cannot
use
extraneous
elements
and
guilty
pleas
generally
to
establish
that
something
was
necessary
for
a
conviction.
but
if
you
look
at
the
criminal
tax
manual
that
he
invokes,
it
makes
clear
by
referring
to
relevant
conduct
and
the
need
for
the
loss
amount
there
to
include
all
of
the
losses
for
all
of
the
years
in
the
indictment,
even
if
the
defendant
has
pleaded
guilty
to
only
an
individual
count
for
a
single
year
of
tax
evasion,
that
the
loss
amounts
that
is
typically
included
in
guilty
pleas
in
7201
cases
is
not
the
loss
amount
that
is
relevant
here.
it
is
in
fact
directly
parallel
to
the
sentencing
stipulation
that
--
that
the
petitioner
entered
into
here.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
