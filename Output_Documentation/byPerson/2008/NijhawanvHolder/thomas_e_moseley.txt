mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
an
aggravated
felony
definition,
8
u.s.c.
1101(a)(43)(m)(i),
one
that
serves
both
as
a
ground
of
deportation
and
as
an
integral
part
of
a
federal
criminal
statute.
for
the
court's
convenient
reference,
because
i
suspect
we
will
return
to
this
and
the
other
definitions,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
statutory
appendix
in
the
government's
brief:
3a
gives
(m)(i);
6a
gives
the
conviction
requirement;
and
7a
to
8a
gives
the
underlying
criminal
statute
in
which
this
aggravated
felony
definition
forms
an
integral
part.
now,
congress
has
required
--
for
deportation,
congress
has
required
conviction
of
this
defined
offense,
in
a
definition
that
says
absolutely
nothing
about
the
word
"tether"
utilized
by
the
third
circuit
below,
and
the
definition
begins
with
a
restrictive
clause,
"that",
to
require
conviction
of
both
the
fraud
and
deceit
element
and
also
the
loss
amount
as
an
integral
part
of
this
definition.
since
congress
required
conviction,
the
time-honored
categorical
approach
really
should
be
the
governing
standard,
and
i
submit
that
there's
nothing
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
the
underlying
statute
enacted
by
congress,
to
oust
that
time-honored
approach,
which
i
submit
is
perhaps
on
a
par
as
being
presumptively
applicable,
similarly
to
the
--
to
the
stay
standards
that
this
court
discussed
very
recently
in
the
nken
case.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
i
--
under
those
circumstances,
justice
kennedy,
yes.
but
here
the
jury
was
specifically
instructed
that
they
did
not
have
to
make
any
finding
with
respect
to
loss
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
well,
i
--
i--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--yes,
but
let
me
--
certainly
among
the
state
statutes
that
we
cite,
the
state
statutes
where
it's
clear
that
a
loss
amount
is
an
element,
the
jury
is
going
to
be
instructed
they
have
to
return
that,
and
they
do.
the
--
the
special
verdict
opportunity
here
is
in
effect,
i
would
submit,
a
kind
of
lifeline,
if
you
will,
that
we're
giving
to
the
government
in
these
--
in
these
more
general
fraud
statutes,
where
the
government
has
that
--
certainly
has
that
opportunity
or
that
option
to
do.
but
there
certainly
have
been
--
and
i
know
we
cite
them
in
our
brief
--
cases--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--no,
justice
alito.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
this
statute
--
and
again,
(m)(i)
was
enacted
as
part
of
a
number
of
criminal
statutes
--
excuse
me
--
as
a
number
of
provisions
that
were
addressed
to
white
collar
offenses,
of
which
this
is
just
one,
and
it
also
encompasses
the
state
--
it
also
encompasses
the
state
statutes
where
this
clearly
is--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--in
those
cases,
no.
in
those
cases,
that
would
have
satisfied
the
traditional
categorical
approach.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
i
believe
two
in
addition
to
mr.
nijhawan,
justice
ginsburg.
i
believe
two
or
three
more
were.
this
case
--
this
case
involved
roughly
15
defendants.
there
are
only
five
who
went
to
trial.
the
number
who
--
the
number
who
are
aliens,
in
addition
to
mr.
nijhawan,
i
believe
were
two.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
well,
under
--
under
those
--
under
those
circumstances,
justice
ginsburg,
mr.
nijhawan
actually
himself
had
asked
for
a
charge
with
--
with
respect
to
loss.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
there's
an
issue
of
jury
confusion
here,
and
indeed
under
--
under
--
ironically
under
this
court's
--
well,
this
would
have
been
a
situation
in
which
a
request
was
--
could
have
been
made.
i
don't
think
there
would
have
been
--
there
certainly
wouldn't
have
been
jury
confusion
to
have
requested
it
here.
but
i
think
you
have
to
put
this
in
--
in
the
larger
picture
of
a
statute
of
a
set
of
aggravated
felony
definitions
that
were
enacted.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
well,
actually,
justice
ginsburg,
under
this
court's
decision
in
boulware,
a
deficiency
is
indeed
a
necessary
element
of
that--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--but
--
no.
a
--
a
deficiency
is
a
necessary
element
of
that
offense.
that's
--
that's
where,
for
example,
the
babaisakov
decision
got
that
point
flatly
wrong.
and
this
is,
i
think,
the
classic--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--no,
it
doesn't
have
to
find
that,
but
it
may.
and
this
is
a
classic
example
of
the
application
of
the
modified
categorical
approach,
where
this
statute
sweeps
broadly
to
include
both
loss
amounts
or,
in
this
case,
revenue
loss
amounts
that
would
exceed
$10,000
and
those
that
would
be
less
than
$10,000.
most
of
these
cases,
most
of
the
tax
cases,
as
the
government's
own
materials
that
we
cite
indicate,
are
resolved
by
guilty
pleas
with
respect
to
where
those
amounts
are
designated.
and
i
think
it's
important
here
to
realize
that
by
pairing
these
two
statutes,
by
pairing
these
two
provisions,
(m)(i)
and
(m)(ii),
congress
in
effect
i
submit
sent
the
signal
with
that
language
in
(m)(ii)
that
we're
talking
about
the
kind
--
we're
talking
about
the
application
of
the
modified
categorical--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--because,
justice
alito,
in
the
sentencing
context
we're
truly
dealing
with
a
post-verdict
situation
where
the
government
in
terms
of
having
to
prove
loss
is
up
against
a
far
lesser
amount
--
a
far
more
liberal
standard,
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
and
the
defendant
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--he's
admitting
it
here,
justice
souter,
under
these
circumstances.
he's
admitting
it
here
only
in
the
context
of
a
resolution
of
the
sentencing
issue.
if
you
go
back
to
the--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--no,
but
he's
--
but
he's
doing
this
in
the
context
of
resolving,
of
resolving
a
disputed
issue
with
respect
to--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--but
he
does
so
certainly
in
the
context
here
of
reserving,
of
reserving
his
right
to
contest
that
and
to
make
the
arguments
that
we're
making
here.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
no,
i
submit
--
i
submit
that
there
--
there
really
is
a
--
a
profound
difference
under
the
circumstances
of
someone
being
in
a
situation
before,
before
conviction,
and
then
someone
being
in
a
postconviction
situation.
and
then
i
think
we
should
come
back
in
terms
--
we
should
come
back
to
the
underlying,
to
the
underlying
requirement
that
the
person
had
been
--
the
person
under
the
statute
be
convicted
of
the
loss.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
i
don't
think
necessarily.
well,
under
these
circumstances,
justice
souter,
what
i
would
say
is
that
there
may
be
statutes,
there
may
be
statutes
in
which,
there
are
statutes,
there
are
state
statutes,
where
you
have
a
range
of
conduct
that
may
include
$10,000,
may
not
include
$10,000,
and
the
modified
categorical
approach
would
apply
under
those.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
certainly
if
it
does,
then
under
the
statutes
involved
here
we
would
prevail.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
well,
i
think
the
government
vastly
understates
the
statutory
provisions
that
were
involved
here.
even
if
you
look
at
the
state
statutes,
a
majority
of
the
state
statutes,
as
i
think
we
make
clear
in
our
reply
brief,
a
majority
of
states
have
statutes,
generally
the
theft
by
deception
statutes
and
others
which
have
loss
thresholds
that
will
get
you
over--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--but
what
congress
has
done
here
is
to
provide
for
a
uniform
test,
in
effect.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
but
what
--
but
what
--
if
i
can
just
go
back
for
a
moment,
justice
souter,
to
the
original
premise
that
it
under
all
circumstances
has
to
be
an
element.
there
are
certainly
statutes,
even
federal
statutes,
for
example,
the
theft
from
federal
--
federally
funded
programs,
which
give
specific
loss
amounts
of
5,000
or
more,
which
would
--
which
--
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
what
--
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
what
congress
did
here
was
to
create
a
uniform
test,
a
uniform
test
in
the
sense
you
look
to
see
if
--
if
someone
has
been
convicted
of
both
these
requirements,
fraud
or
deceit
or
the
loss.
that
certainly
produces
far
more
uniformity
than
had--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--but
congress
chose
under
these
circumstances,
congress
chose
under
these
circumstances
to
--
swept
broadly
to,
swept
broadly
to
state
statutes
in
addition,
in
addition,
in
addition
to,
in
addition
to
encompassing
the
federal
statute.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
what
i
believe,
what
i
believe
that
i
am
conceding
is
that
it
will
determine
--
as
with
any
of
the
criminal
cases
that
lead
to
deportation,
it
will
determine
--
it
will
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
how
the
prosecution
chooses
--
excuse
me
--
chooses
to
charge.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
the
--
the
statute
--
the
statute
says
that
someone
has
to
be
convicted
of
--
of
both
these
aspects,
both
of--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--if,
justice
stevens,
if
you
read
it
in
conjunction
with
the
conviction
requirement
--
in
other
words,
to
--
to
be
deportable,
to
be
deportable,
that's
in
--
in
6a.
someone
who
has
been
convicted
of
an
aggravated
felony
is
deportable;
and
also
someone
who
has
been
convicted
of
an
aggravated
felony
is
subject
to,
under
--
under--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--i
think
under
those
circumstances,
though,
particularly
if
you
look
at
the
statutes
which
make
gradations
of
sentencing
on
the
basis
of
loss
amounts,
you
clearly
would
be
convicted
of
that.
it
is
--
because
that's
a
necessary
element
that's
going
to
--
that's
a
necessary
fact
that's
going
to
have
to
be
found
to
put
you
in
a
particular
sentencing
range.
so
you
--
so
you
definitely
would
be
--
you
would
be
under
those
circumstances
convicted
of
that
amount.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
--
to
recognize
what
--
that
congress
--
that
congress
in
enacting
the
statute
and
in
predicating
removal
upon
conviction
used
language
that
sharply
distinguishes
--
that
is
sharply
distinguished
from
the
position
that
the
government
advocates
here
that
loss
should
be
something
to
be
determined
in
separate
--
in
--
in
separate
removal
proceedings.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
well,
the
jury
--
under
those
circumstances,
it
will
depend
upon
how
the
government
chooses,
justice
ginsburg,
to
prosecute
the
case.
and
if
the
government
chooses
to
prosecute
the
case
by
seeking
a
determination
of
the
deficiency
amount
in
a
jury
charge,
then
--
then,
yes
--
then,
yes,
indeed,
they
would.
but
again,
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases
are
resolved.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
well,
they
--
they
are
--
they
are
meant
to
operate
the
same
way.
but
i
think
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
the
fact
that
deficiency
is
a
requirement
and
that
deficiency
in
most
cases
will
be
established
by
a
plea,
and
that
this
is
a
statute
that
sweeps
broadly;
that
this
is
a
statute
that
sweeps
--
excuse
me
--
sweeps
broadly
to
encompass
both
a
loss
in
excess
of
10,000
--
a
deficiency
in
excess
of
$10,000
or
a
deficiency
under
$10,000.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
what
--
what
i
am
suggesting
in
the
tax
case
is
that
it
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
government
to
seek
such
a
special
interrogatory
if
they
wish
to
establish
the
tax
loss,
which
is
an
element
of
the
--
which
is
a
necessary
component
of
the
offense,
if
they
wanted
to
establish
it
--
if
they
wanted
to
establish
it
for
--
for
purposes
--
for
whatever
purpose
they
wanted
to
establish
it.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
that's
--
that's
--
that
--
again,
that
is
going
to
depend
on
--
that's
going
to
depend
upon
how
the
government
chooses
to
--
to
prosecute
under
these
particular--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--no,
i--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--i
--
i
understand.
but
my
--
my
point,
justice
scalia,
on
this
one
is
that
--
on
(m)(ii)
is
that
it
is
--
it
is
a
statute
in
which
--
in
which
loss
can
or
is
required
to
be
shown,
some
deficiency
is
required
to
be
shown,
and
this
may
--
and
this
may
well
be
done
by
the
modified
--
the
modified
categorical
approach,
particularly
in
--
in
--
particularly
in
situations
in
which,
as
in
most
cases,
it's
resolved
by
a
plea.
now,
if
--
if
--
but
--
and
also,
this
statute
was
enacted
against
the
backdrop
of
--
of
the
categorical
approach,
and
the
act
was
amended
--
has
been
amended
roughly
four
times
during
this
period
with
no
indication
that
congress
certainly
intended
to
jettison
this.
and
i
think
it's
also
important
here
to
note
the
structure
of
the
act
in
terms
of
how
congress
sharply
distinguished
between
what
would
happen
with
conviction
and
--
and
what
would
happen
with
sentence.
they
did
enact
specific
provisions,
101(a)(43),
subpart
(f)
at
2a
of
the
statutory
appendix
and
(g)
at
2a
of
the
statutory
appendix,
which
talk
about
--
which
--
which
talk
about
sentencing
and
make
that
sharp
distinction.
but
i
think
we
should
not
also
lose
sight
of
the
overarching
fact
here
that
this
provision
is
an
integral
part
of
a
federal
criminal
statute,
1326(b),
so
that
any
ambiguity
in
the
--
so
that
an
ambiguity
in
the
construction
and
application
of
this
statute
should
as
--
similarly
to
--
to
what
this
court
held
in
leocal,
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
--
in
favor
of
the
alien,
because
it's
the
classic
multiple
or
dual
use
statute
that
has
both
civil
and
criminal
applications,
and
very
severe
criminal
applications
as
well.
i
see
i
have
5
minutes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
the
--
i
will
--
i
will--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
deference,
the
fact
that
this
is
part
of
a
federal
criminal
statute
i
believe
doesn't
get
us
--
cuts
off
the
inquiry,
and
we
don't
get
to
chevron
deference
here.
we
deal
with
a
dual
use
statute
which
has
both
civil
and
criminal
applications,
so
that
under
these
circumstances,
certainly
as
this
court
held
in
leocal
and
in
lopez-gonzalez,
chevron
deference
with
respect
to
babaisakov
would
not
--
for
example
--
would
not
be
triggered.
i
think,
moreover,
it's
important
to
note
that
the
babaisakov
got
(m)(ii)
wrong
--
got
the
--
the
requirement
of
a
deficiency
wrong,
and
also
got
wrong
the
fact
that
there
were
no
statutes
involved
where
fraud
--
where
a
loss
amount
in
excess
of
$10,000
would
be
an
element.
finally,
i
think
the
government's
reading
of
this
statute
might
make
sense
if
congress
had
said
that
--
convicted
of
a
crime
in
--
a
crime
in
which
fraud
or
deceit
is
an
element,
with
loss
to
be
found
at
removal
proceedings
in
excess
of
$10,000.
but
that's
not
the
language
that
congress
employed
here,
and
under
these
circumstances,
even
if
the
statute
is
perceived
to
be
ambiguous,
that
ambiguity
should
be
resolved
in
the
petitioner's
favor.
mr.

but--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--but
what
the
government
has
said,
if
they're
going
to
do
a
prosecution
under
8
u.s.c.
1326(b),
that
they
would
seek
to
prove
this
amount
de
novo
in
the
underlying
criminal
proceeding.
so
it
will
form
--
it
would
form
part
of
a
--
it
would
form
part
of
a
criminal
prosecution--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--right,
and
that--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--it
shouldn't,
justice
scalia,
because
we
deal
with
a
dual
use
statute,
as
this
court
said
in
leocal,
which
indeed
was
also
a
civil
removal
proceeding,
or
lopez-gonzalez,
which
was
a
civil
removal
proceedings.
leocal
involved
18
u.s.c.
16
--
16(b),
and--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--but
it
was
--
but
in
lopez-gonzalez,
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
board
of
immigration
appeals
decision,
matter
of
yanez,
which
was
directly
opposite
to
what
this
court
held
and
ultimately
rejected
in
that
decision.
there
--
this
clearly
is
a
statute,
i
submit,
that
implicates
--
that
implicates
a
federal
criminal
prosecution
later.
and
indeed
if
the
government,
as
the
government's
brief,
says
that
they're
going
to
prove
this
amount
in
some
subsequent
illegal
reentry
prosecution,
that
i
submit
raises
more
far
more
concerns
with
respect
to
practicality.
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
no--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--well,
that
may
be
a
separate
issue,
justice
kennedy.
there
is
the
sentencing
enhancement
if
it's
after
--
if
someone
enters
or
reenters
illegally
after
a
conviction
of
an
aggravated
felony.
and
what
the
government
apparently
has
said
is
that
they
would
prove
for
a
person
whose
aggravated
felony
arguably
falls
within
(i)--
mr.
thomas
e.
moseley
--they
would
prove
that
loss
de
novo
in
federal
court.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
