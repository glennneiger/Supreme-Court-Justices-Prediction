another--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
please.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
he's
admitting
it,
what
does
the
standard
of
the
evidence
matter?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he's
not
saying,
i
admit
to
a
degree
of
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
it
was
over
10,000.
he's
saying,
period,
over
10,000.
the
burden
of
proof,
the
standard
of
proof
doesn't
matter.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
he
definitively
resolves
it
by
admission.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
understand
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
was
commenting
on
your
answer
to
justice
alito's
question,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
answer
to
the
question
is
there
is
no
difference.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
that
really
gets
to
the
question
that
i
was
going
to
ask,
and
that
is,
i
don't
see
how
the
modified
categorical
approach
is
something
that
you
could
admit
would
be
sufficient
because,
as
i
understand
your
argument
--
and
it
is
in
part
an
argument
based
on
sort
of
standard
grammatical
construction
--
you're
saying
that
in
the
definition
"the
term
"aggravated
felony"
means
an
offense
that.
"
--and
you
emphasize
the
"that",
the
restrictive
nature
of
the
"that"
clause
--
"involves
fraud
or
deceit
in
which
the
loss
exceeds
$10,000.
"
if
i
understand
your
restrictive
clause
argument,
the
definition
of
the
offense
has
got
to
include
the
element
of
exceeding
$10,000
or
it
does
not
satisfy
your,
the
--
it
does
not
satisfy
the
standard
that
you
were
arguing
for
based
on
the
restrictive
clause.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you've
got
to
go
the
whole
hog
or
you
get
nothing,
and
the
whole
hog
is
that
it's
got
to
be
an
element
of
the
offense
that
the
loss
exceed
$10,000.
am
i
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
how
about
this
one.
you
were
arguing
based
on
this
statute
and
you
make
an
argument
based
on
the
restrictive
nature
of
a
$10,000.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yeah,
you
would
prevail,
but
you
would
prevail,
it
seems
to
me,
at
the
expense
of
this
objection,
and
the
government
makes
it.
there
are
very,
very
few
fraud
and
deceit
statutes
that
define
the
offense
by
reference
to
a
loss
in
excess
of
$10,000.
my
recollection
from
the
government's
brief
is
that
they
come
up
with
three.
the
fact
is
also
that
this
provision,
the
$10,000
figure,
was
placed
into
the
statute
at
a
time
when
congress
was
trying
to
expand
the
category
of
deportable,
removable
offenses,
and
it
would
be
passing
strange
in
that
context
to
define
the
offense
by
reference
to
a
$10,000
figure
as
an
element
of
the
offense
which
would
cut
it
down,
which
would
cut
the
compass
of
the
statute
down
to
three
offenses.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
once
you
get
into
the
state
statutes
you
get
into
the
further
problem
of
an
utter
and
i
would
suppose
unjust
patchwork
of
statutory
reference
to
which
this
would
apply.
if
you
--
if
you
steal
the
$11,000
in
state
a,
you
get
booted
out
of
the
country.
if
you
steal
it
across
the
state
line
in
state
b,
you
stay
home.
i
mean,
i
can't
imagine
that
congress
would
have
enacted
that
kind
of
scheme.
justice
david
h.
souter
a
uniform
test
that
produces
both
unjust
results
and
i
would
suppose
strangely
unsatisfying
results
to
a
congress
that
wanted
to
expand
the
concept
of
deportable
offense.
