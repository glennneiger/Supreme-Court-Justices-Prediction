in
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
this
case,
how
many
of
the
defendants
were
alien?
you're
--
the
jury
is
given
a
charge
that
covers
all
of
the
defendants.
they're
all
charged
with
the
same
crime.
how
many
of
them
were
aliens?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
the
judge
wouldn't
distinguish
--
it
would
not
be
relevant
for
the
--
for
the
defendants
who
were
not
aliens
because
it
would
have
no
consequences
for
them.
so
why
should
the
judge
--
even
if
the
question
could
be
asked,
why
should
the
judge
--
the
judge
takes
a
position:
it's
not
an
element
of
the
crime.
therefore,
i'm
not
going
to
charge
it,
and
i'm
not
going
to
confuse
the
jury
by
saying
as
to
the
defendants
who
are
aliens,
you
have
to
find
the
amount.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
before
you
go
on
to
that,
we're
talking
about
(m)(i).
it's
coupled
with
another
provision
that's
an
offense
that
is
described
in
section
21
--
7201
of
title
26
--
that's
tax
evasion
--
in
which
the
revenue
loss
to
the
government
exceeds
10,000.
so
it's
the
same
"in
which"
construction,
and
there's
no
requirement
--
to
convict
someone
of
tax
evasion,
the
jury
does
not
have
to
find
the
deficiency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
deficiency,
but
not
the
amount
of
the
deficiency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
the
amount
--
there's
a
deficiency.
the
jury
has
to
find
in
order
to
find
tax
evasion
there
is
a
deficiency.
does
it
have
to
find
that
the
revenue
loss
to
the
government
exceeds
$10,000?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
problem
is
that
there's
no
pattern
to
it,
the
point
that
justice
souter
made.
if
we
take
your
position
that
there
are
a
number
of
statutes
that
mention
amount,
some
as
an
element,
some
by
this,
there
seems
to
be
no
rhyme
or
reason
to
when
the
amount
is
there
and
when
it
isn't,
and
then
you
have
these
unequal
results
within
the
federal
system
and
in
the
states,
so
when
you
think
--
would
it
make
any
sense
for
congress
to
have
drawn
the
line
that
way
if
the
state
happens
to
make
--
to
have
the
"in
which"
or
if
it
just
has
fraud
and
deceit
with
no
amount?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
treating
people
who
do
the
identical
thing
differently.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
you're
saying
is
you're
not
denying
that
people
who
commit
the
identical
theft
or
deceit
or
fraud
will
be
treated
differently
depending
on
whether
the
statute
under
which
they're
convicted
has
this
"in
which"
clause?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
go
back
to
my
question,
which
i
don't
think
you've
fully
answered?
and
that's
the
tax
evasion
situation.
for
any
tax
--
a
person
who
is
charged
with
tax
evasion
who
goes
to
trial
and
is
convicted,
that
person
would
not
be
deportable,
as
i
understand
it
under
your
reading,
because
the
jury
is
not
asked
to
determine
the
amount
of
the
deficiency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
know.
you
told
me
that
most
of
them
admit
it
at
the
plea
stage.
but
going
to
trial,
these
are
parallel
provisions,
and
it
seems
to
me
they
are
meant
to
operate
the
same
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
--
but
this
defendant
did
ask,
didn't
--
he
asked
the
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
judge,
when
he
arrives
at
the
restitution
amount,
have
discretion
to
say,
as
to
this
particular
defendant,
he
was
just
an
accountant
with
the
company
that
was
committing
the
fraud,
he
didn't
put
anything
into
his
own
pocket
except
the
salary
they
paid
him,
so
i'm
going
to
exclude
him
from
the
restitution
order?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
in
--
in
my
very
hypothetical--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
--
even
though
this
defendant
did
not
pocket
any
gain?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
defendant's
argument
that
at
least
as
far
as
his
admission
for
sentencing
purposes,
he
did
that
only
because
otherwise
the
government
wouldn't
ask
for
a
downward
departure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
appropriate
burden
of
proof
was
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that
is
in
the
second
proceeding,
the
recidivist,
the
multiple
offender
proceeding--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
relationship,
domestic
relationship
had
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
which
is
not
the
standard
that
the
bia
used.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
you're
talking
about,
the
alien
who
is
convicted
of
a
qualifying
crime,
an
aggravating
felony,
then
tries
--
then
comes
back
illegally.
the
difference
between
two
years
and
20
years,
you
admit
there
you
would
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
