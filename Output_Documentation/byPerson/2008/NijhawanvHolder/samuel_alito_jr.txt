justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
you
--
if
you
do
extend
that
lifeline
to
the
government,
aren't
you
conceding
that
the
amount
of
the
loss
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense,
and
aren't
you
conceding
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
loss
amount
to
be
an
element
of
the
offense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
you
a
concrete
example.
let's
say
it's
a
federal
mail
fraud
case.
let's
say
there
are
two
federal
mail
fraud
cases,
and
you
don't
have
to
prove
the
amount
of
loss
in
order
to
convict
under
the
mail
fraud
statute.
in
the
first
case,
after
the
jury
returns
a
guilty
verdict
they
also
return
--
or
together
with
that
they
answer
a
special
interrogatory
and
they
say
the
loss
exceeded
$10,000.
in
the
second
case,
the
defendant
pleads
guilty
and
admits
during
the
plea
colloquy
that
the
amount
is
more
than
$10,000.
would
there
be
a
problem
in
those
cases?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
then--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
is
the
--
what
is
the
difference
between
a
defendant's
saying
during
a
guilty
plea
colloquy,
the
loss
was
--
i
admit
the
loss
was
more
than
$10,000;
and
the
defendant's
agreeing
for
sentencing
purposes
that
the
loss
was
more
than
$10,000?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
did
you
have
any
authority
for
the
--
the
idea
that
a
trial
judge
in
a
criminal
case
should
ask
the
jury
to
answer
a
special
interrogatory
regarding
a
question
that
has
no
bearing
on
the
conviction,
but
may
have
a
bearing
on
the
future
immigration
status
of
the
defendant,
which
is
what
you're
suggesting
should
be
done
in
these
tax
cases?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
this,
does
this
--
which
is
not
exactly
on
point
to
the
issue
here,
but
does
the
government
have
a
theory
about
how
the
loss
is
measured
for
purposes
of
this
statute?
under
the
sentencing
guidelines,
the
loss
was
a
very
complicated
calculation,
lots
of
rules
about
relevant
conduct
and
lots
of
cases
and
different
ways
of
proving
loss,
and
here
we
just
have
the
statute.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
you
have
somebody
who
participates
in
a
--
in
a
scheme
involving
$100
million,
the
total
loss
is
$10,000,
but
this
person
had
no
way
of
reasonably
anticipating
that
this
would
be
the
--
the
total
amount
of
the
loss,
this
was
a
minor
participant,
and
--
where
would
the
--
how
would
that
come
out?
