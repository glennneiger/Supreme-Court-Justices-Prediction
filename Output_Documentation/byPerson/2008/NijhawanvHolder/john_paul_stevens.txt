justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
moseley,
can
i
get
your
help
on
a
question
i
really
have
difficulty
with.
it
seems
to
me
as
i
read
the
text,
it
is
easy
to
read
it
in
one
of
two
ways:
it
involves
fraud
or
deceit
in
which
the
loss
to
the
victim
in
fact
exceeded
$10,000.
in
that
case
you
would
lose.
or
it
could
be
read
to
say
involves
fraud
or
deceit
in
which
an
element
of
the
crime
is
that
the
victim
or
victims
exceeded
a
loss
of
$10,000.
you
would
lose
under
that
also
because
it
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime.
so
you
are
relying
on
a
modified
approach,
and
under
your
modified
approach
what
does
the
statute
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
conviction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
position
--
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
it
--
is
that
if
the
record
in
this
case
had
been
--
let's
say
it's
a
mail
fraud
case,
they
proved
one
mailing
and
one
victim
lost
$30,
and
that's
all
the
trial
established,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
could
establish
this
was
part
of
a
scheme,
just
like
the
one
we've
got
here,
in
which
millions
of
dollars
were
lost,
you
could
prove
that
independently
and
he
would
still
be
required
to
be
deported?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
scheme
--
the
evidence
of
the
scheme
consisted
of
just
two
mailings,
say.
they
allege
a
scheme
and
say
it's
a
broad
--
a
broad
scheme,
but
they
don't
describe
the
amount.
they
merely
prove
two
mailings
that
involved
$25
apiece.
but
the
scheme
itself,
because
you
proved
it
in
other
cases,
you
have
the
facts,
actually
was
a
big
scheme
like
we
have
here.
could
they
rely
on
that
for
--
for
immigration
purposes
in
a
proceeding
like
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
determine
exactly
what
you
proved
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
didn't
describe
the
dimensions
of
the
scheme.
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
it
only
affected
--
it
was
one
scheme
that
was
as
large
as
this
one,
but
the
evidence
to
prove
the
scheme
only
required
you
to
prove
two
or
three
mailings
involving
small
amounts
of
money.
but
then
later
on
you
proved
before
the
immigration
judge
there
really
was
a
big
scheme,
and
that's
the
one
he
was
convicted
of.
isn't
that
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
had
the
evidence,
but
you
didn't
need
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
it's
easy;
i'm
wondering
if
it's
necessary.
i
--
i
think
under
your
theory,
it
would
not
be
necessary.
as
long
as
the
evidence
is
out
there,
you
can
use
it
in
a
de
novo
proceeding
before
the
immigration
judge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
my
--
he
pleads
guilty
to
the
mammoth
scheme
proved,
the
evidence
before
the
court
or
on
the
plea
colloquy,
whatever
is
described
is
enough
to
show
that
he
was
guilty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
as
i
understand
it,
you
can
prove
the
size
of
the
scheme
later
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
--
but
the
chief
justice
points
out
that
the
facts
that
make
the
fraud
aggravated
are
facts
that
you
do
not
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
which
takes
back
to
your
opponent's
argument.
therefore,
you
were
not
convicted
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
aggravated
felony
that's
the
basis
for
the
immigration
order.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
were
not
convicted
of
the
aggravated
offense
that
--
the
issue
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
--
but
you
hadn't
been
convicted
of
the
aggravated
offense
until
you
established
its
aggravation
by
proof
of
less
--
not
under
a
reasonable
doubt.
so
the
word
"convicted"
really
is
pretty
important.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
word
"convicted"
--
the
question
is
whether
the
word
"convicted"
applies
to
the
word
"aggravated".
that's
the
point,
as
i
understand
the
chief
justice's
questioning,
which
goes
to
the
burden
of
proof.
so
you
would
win
even
under
that
approach
if
you
said
you
had
a
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
other
factors.
but
the
thing
that
creates
the
--
the
missing
link
is
that
to
convert
it
from
ordinary
fraud
to
aggravated
fraud,
you
have
to
prove
x
under
one
view
by
a
reasonable
--
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but,
under
your
view,
by
only
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
