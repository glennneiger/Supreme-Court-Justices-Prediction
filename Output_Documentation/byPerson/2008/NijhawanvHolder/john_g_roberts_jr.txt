chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
nijhawan
v.
holder.
mr.
moseley.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gannon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
then
you
just
--
you,
the
government,
says
--
you
know,
you'll
have
a
little
debate
about
what
the
special
interrogatory,
how
it
is
phrased,
and
your
objection
there
could
be
dealt
with
on
--
during
that
negotiation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
gannon,
we're
dealing
with
the
definition
of
a
particular
term,
aggravated
felony.
and
yet
you
say
the
only
thing
that
you
have
to
prove
under
the
protections
of
criminal
law
to
prove
that
this
is
an
aggravated
felony
is
that
it
involved
fraud
or
deceit.
now,
the
other
elements
--
the
other
provisions
here
talk
about
firearms
offenses,
child
pornography
offenses,
national
security
offenses,
but
here
it's
fraud
or
deceit.
i
mean,
it's
a
felony,
but
there's
nothing
that
strikes
--
strikes
me
that
it's
particularly
an
aggravated
felony.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
yet
that's
all
you
have
to
prove
with
the
protections
of
the
criminal
law
as
opposed
to
the
civil.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
not
subject
to
the
protections
of
criminal
law
that
you
have
to
show.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
with
the
jury
protections.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
i
guess
what
i'm
saying,
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
aggravated,
the
$10,000,
in
contrast
to
the
other
things,
which
are
aggravated
by
virtue
of
elements
that
you
have
to
approve
--
you
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
--
is
that
it's
fraud
ir
deceit.
and
as
i
said,
there's
nothing
about
that
that
--
it's
bad,
but
it
doesn't
strike
me
as
particularly
aggravated.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
just
--
i
think
that's
kind
of
begging
the
question.
you
assume
that
those
elements,
those
provisions
also
don't
have
to
be
proved
as
elements.
and
what
i'm
suggesting,
i
guess,
is
that
if
the
only
thing
that
makes
it
aggravated
is
--
is
something
you
don't
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
it
seems
that
we
ought
to
look,
well,
is
that
really
aggravated?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
when
you're
talking
about
firearm
offenses,
or
child
pornography,
yes,
that's
aggravated;
but
fraud
and
deceit
is
kind
of
a
run
of
the
mine
felony.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
i
don't
understand
how
that's
responsive.
it's
--
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--crime
of
violence.
in
other
words
it
seems
to
me
you're
already
in
the
aggravated
area,
so
it
makes
sense
to
say
that's
what
you
have
to
prove.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
--
i
guess
i
don't
understand
the
answer,
and
i'm
sorry
if
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
hard
to
get
through.
[laughter]
it
just
--
you're
saying
is
that
there
are
exceptions,
but
i
don't
see
that
that
detracts
from
the
point
that
"crime
of
violence"
--
you
think
right
away,
well,
that's
aggravated;
national
security
crimes,
that's
aggravated;
firearms
offenses,
that's
aggravated.
they're
sort
of
on
their
own
without
respect
to
these
other
things
that
you
say
you
only
have
to
prove
by
the
civil
--
pursuant
to
the
civil
burden
requirements.
fraud
or
deceit
--
as
i
guess
i've
already
said,
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
particularly
aggravated.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
makes
it
aggravated
is
something
as
to
which
you
have
a
much
lighter
burden.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
gannon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
moseley,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
