mr.
samuel
issacharoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
court
has
indicated,
this
is
a
question
of
jurisdiction,
and
the
issue
is
whether
a
bankruptcy
court
may
enter
an
order
that
goes
to
a
nondebtor,
offers
a
release
against
independent
state
law
claims.
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
well,
the
counsel
for
petitioner
can't
give
that
answer
for
two
separate
reasons.
the
first
has
to
do
with
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
limitation
of
a
bankruptcy
court,
that
as
soon
as
the
release
is
outside
the
debtor's
estate
and
impact
on
the
debtor's
estate
or
the
debtor/creditor
relationship,
that
places
it
beyond
the
power
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
if
--
if
these
parties
had
been
present,
if
they
had
been
appealed,
if
this
had
been
in
effect
a
settlement
orchestrated
through
the
bankruptcy
court,
then
there
might
be
the
--
the
ability
to
release
as
a
class
action--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--it
is--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--justice
kennedy,
it
is
a
question
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
if
it
is
not
to
be
a
consensual
agreement.
if
there
is
not
to
be
--
the
purpose
of
notice
is
to
give
you
the
opportunity
to
opt
out
and
to
object--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--they
do
know
about
it.
you're--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--justice
breyer,
i
misunderstood
justice
kennedy's
question
to
be
about
1986,
not
about
the
present.
and
in
--
in
the
original
confirmation,
these
people
had
not
filed
suit,
had
not
made
claims
at
the
time.
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
well,
the
question
is--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--no,
i
don't
believe
it
is
about
notice.
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
i
agree.
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
in
--
in
your
example,
justice
breyer,
you
rely
upon
this
court's
decision
in
celotex,
which
adopted
the
pacor
test
from
the
third
circuit.
and
in
each
case
that
has
applied
that,
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
potential
impact
upon
the
estate
of
the
bankrupt.
the
critical
issue
in
this
case
is
that
not
a
single
one
of
the
claims
that
is
presented
or
seeks
to
be
enjoined
here
has
any
potential
impact
on
the--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--there
is
no
asbestos
case
that
i
am
aware
of
that
has
released
third-party
claims
that
have
no
impact
on
the
debtor.
i
am
not
aware
of
a
single
one.
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
no,
i
don't--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--i
think
that
the
facts
of
record
indicate
that
travelers
went
into
this
particular
deal
full
well
knowing
that
it
was
not
getting
this
kind
of
release
because
that
kind
of
release
was
not
available.
and
i
think--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--justice
souter,
i
would
say
two
things.
first
of
all,
that
the
record
speaks
to
specific
negotiations
between
travelers
and
manville
and
between
all
the
insurers
and
manville
on
prospective
liabilities
of
the
--
of
the
insurance
companies,
so
that
the
bankruptcy
court
can
be
read
to
be
just
cleaning
up
what
had
happened
retrospectively
up
until
that
point.
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
i
--
i
understand
that.
but
it's
also
important
--
i
think
that
there
was
a
question
raised
by
--
by
justice
alito
a
minute
ago
about
what
exactly
had
happened
in
1986
and
whether
the
second
circuit
was
making
findings
of
fact
or
findings
of
law.
in
1988,
in
the
macarthur
case,
the
second
circuit
relied
on
section
1334(d)
as
the
jurisdictional
basis
for
upholding
the
district
--
the
bankruptcy
order.
section
1334(d),
which
is
now
recodified
as
1334(e),
has
to
do
only
with
the
disposition
of
the
assets
of
the
estate,
the
property
of
the
estate.
and
so,
the
second
circuit
order
in
19
--
in
1988,
which
is
the
controlling
legal
authority
on
what
the
scope
of
the
release
was,
went
only
to
the
property
of
the
estate.
and
so,
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
understanding
at
the
time
by
anyone
that
there
was
a
release
of
claims
that
were
independent
of
the
property
of
the
estate
or
made
--
or
had
no
hold
upon
or
potential
impact
upon
the
property
of
the
estate.
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
well,
your
honor,
some
of
the
releases
that
are
in
effect
in
this
case
go
to
conduct
that
occurred
after
1986.
some
of
them
have
to
do
with
claims
--
for
example,
the
wise
claim
which
is
referred
to
in
the
second
circuit's
opinion
has
to
do
with
claims
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
coverage
of
manville.
they
have
to
do
with
actions
taken
with
regard
to
other
insurers.
this
is
an
exceedingly--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--absolutely,
your
honor.
contract
clauses
do
it
and
class
actions
do
it,
consensual
agreements,
when
there
is
notice,
the
opportunity
to
opt
out,
and
there
is
volition,
they
often
release
much
broader.
but
a
bankruptcy
court
is
an
extraordinary
proceeding.
a
bankruptcy
court
is
an
obligation
that
rights
are
terminated
without
any
consensual--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--no,
i'm
not
talking--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
the
1988
opinion
in
the
macarthur
case,
the
second
circuit
was
quite
clear
that
all
that
was
being
released
was
claims
against
insurance
proceeds
that
had
been
delivered
and
had
become
property
of
the
estate,
whose
depletion
could
affect
the
estate.
and--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--i
agree
that
that
is
the
--
the
general
rule,
that
is
correct.
i
agree
further
that
the
second
circuit
expressly
held,
at
page
31a,
that
the
error
of
the
bankruptcy
court
was
that
it
subsequently
interpreted
the
order
more
broadly
than
the
second
circuit
had
affirmed
in
1988.
i
think
that
that's
the
heart
of
the
case,
because--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
yes,
it
is.
there
is
a
question
which
this
court
has
actually
not
addressed,
which
is
about
the
prospective
application
of
an
order
that
is
entered
without
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
i
don't
think
there's
any
case
squarely
on
point.
certainly
there
are
cases
that
allow
prospective
collateral
challenges
to
an
order
entered
without
personal
jurisdiction.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
addressed
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
but
it
doesn't
have
to--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
address
this
here,
your
honor,
because
in
this
case,
the
initial
order
only
went
--
as
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit,
only
went
to
the
property
of
the
estate.
and
the
second--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--your
honor,
you
gave
two
alternative
definitions
of
"jurisdiction".
the
first
one
we
have
no
problem
with.
obviously
that's
our
argument--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--right.
the
second
one,
i
think
that
this
court
has
to
go
back
to
the
syngenta
case,
which
i
think
is
quite
instructive
on
this
point.
in
syngenta,
there
was
a
settlement
in
a
federal
court
action.
there
is
no
question
that
the
parties
settled,
that
the
moneys
were
paid,
everything
was
done
pursuant
to
that
settlement.
then
one
of
the
parties
goes
into
state
court
and
files
a
claim
that
was
clearly
subsumed
within
the
settlement.
the
district
court
tried
to
issue
an
order,
saying:
i
have
to
have
power
over
this,
because
otherwise
there
could
never
have
been
a
settlement.
and
this
court
unanimously
reversed
on
the
grounds
that
that
had
to
be
brought
through
the
state
court
system,
because
you
could
not
get
jurisdiction
simply
because
of
the
expediency,
the
necessity,
any
of
these
terms
do
not
afford
an
affirmative
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
court.
so
i
think--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--we
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
we
know
that
the
record
indicates
that
they
did
not
believe,
in
1985,
when
they
signed
a
letter
among
all
the
counsel
that
was
submitted
to
the
court,
that
they
were
getting
any
such
release.
so
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
they
would
not
have
gone
into
this
deal,
and
in
fact,
there
have
been
many,
many
asbestos
workouts
since
that
time,
none
of
which
have
releases
that
do
not
affect
the
debtor's
estate.
so
i
don't
know
that
the
factual
premise
is
there.
but
let's
assume
that
it
was,
for
the
purposes
of
the
question.
let's
assume
that
no
insurance
company
would
go
--
go
into
this,
unless
they
get
releases
that
go
far
beyond
normal
jurisdiction
of
a
bankruptcy
court.
i
think
that
under
syngenta
that
has
to
be
given
to
them
by
congress.
congress
in
1334
gave
specific
forms
of
jurisdiction.
it
gave
the
"arising
under"
and
"arising
in"
which
pertain
to
the
activities
of
the
bankrupt,
of
the
debtor.
and
it
gave
"related
to".
and
"related
to",
as
this
court
interpreted
in
celotex,
adopting
the
third
circuit
standard,
"related
to"
means
that
it
has
an
impact
upon
the
estate
of
the
debtor.
and
it's--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--no.
the
bankruptcy
act
actually
has
very
interesting
language
on
point.
the
bankruptcy
act
says,
in
524(g)(4)(ii),
says
that
the
relief
is
for
demands
on
the
debtor,
that
flow
from
demands
on
the
debtor,
and
by
reason
of
the
demands
on
the
debtor.
that's
the
trigger
language
before
we
get
to
roman
numeral
(iii),
which
has
to
do
with
insurance.
so
if
one
actually
looks
at
the
statute,
the
form
of
the
statute
is
that
there
is
releases
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
claim
of
derivative
liability.
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
i
do
not--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--i
do
not
dispute
that
at
all.
but
what
was
done
in
this
case
was
not
simply
what
judge
lifland
did,
but
what
judge
lifland
did
as
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit.
the
bankruptcy
court
does
not
have
stand-alone
powers
to
make
determinations
as
pertain
to,
particularly,
common
law
actions.
that
goes
back
to
the
marathon
pipeline
issue
that
this
court
had
to
--
had
to
address
and
that
congress
sought
to
fix
by
maintaining
a
tight
hold
on
the
"relating
to"
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
making
sure
that
that's
reviewable
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals.
so
the
--
yes,
congress
codified
the
--
the
manville
deal
in
--
in
1994,
but
they
did
so
as
it
was
interpreted
by
the
controlling
courts.
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
the
rule--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--the
rule
of
thumb,
justice
breyer,
is
that
if
there
is
an
automatic
indemnity
against
the
--
the
bankrupt--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--then
our
position
is
that
it
does
not
have
authority.
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
well,
i
think
that
it
comes
down
to
two
questions,
justice
breyer.
one
is
whether
the
constitutional
authority
under
article
i
reaches
beyond--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--no,
i
don't
--
i
--
i
disagree
with
that,
justice
breyer.
i
think
that
the
bankruptcy
court
has
to
point
to
statutory
authority,
and
that--
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
--broad
language
in
the
statute?
mr.
samuel
issacharoff
yes,
there
is
broad
language
in
the
statute.
the
"relating
to"
language
is
quite
broad.
but
the
"relating
to"
language
has
been
interpreted,
and
every
court
that
has
looked
at
it,
this
court
and
--
this
court
and
every
court
of
appeals,
without
any
dissent
in
any
court
of
appeals
that
has
looked
at
this
issue,
has
decided
that
"relating
to"
means
an
impact
on
the
estate.
without
that,
the
bankruptcy
power
has
no
tethers.
