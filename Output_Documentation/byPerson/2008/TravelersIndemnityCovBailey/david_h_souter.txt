justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
ostrager,
is
--
help
me
out,
because
this
is
an
issue
of
fact,
and
i
don't
have
the
record
in
front
of
me
now.
but
didn't
the
1986
order
expressly
include
permission
for
certain
actions
alleging
insurer
misconduct
to
proceed,
those
that
had
already
been
filed?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
drew
the
implication
from
that
that
the
--
that
the
bankruptcy
court
thought
its
order
would
be
barring
such
actions
if
they
had
not
already
been
filed.
am
i
right
on
the
--
on
the
--
at
least
on
the
record
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
was
saying
that
--
in
effect,
that
was
simply
articulating
rather
more
than
he
had
done
the
first
time
around
and
what
he
intended
the
first
time
around.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
did
they
get
the
notice?
you
say
it's
broad
notice.
what
exactly
was
done?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
make
of
the
provision
of
the
1986
order
to
the
effect
that,
as
i
understand
it
and
as
i
asked
your
brother
a
moment
ago,
existing
claims
based
upon
misbehavior
of
the
--
of
the
insurance
company
were
not
cut
off?
the
reasonable
implication,
i
think,
of
that
is
that
any
future
claims
based
upon
insurance
company
misconduct
would
be
cut
off
by
the
terms
of
the
'86
order.
what
--
what
do
you
say
about
that
implication?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
it
was
prospective
liability
based
upon
misconduct
of
the
insurance
company,
not
merely
derivative
of
--
of
its
insurance
contract
in
--
in
the
conventional
sense.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
if
that
is
--
if
that
is
the
case
--
let's
assume
that
that
is
--
that
it
was
that
narrow.
the
fact
remains,
however,
that
at
this
point,
as
justice
kennedy
has
suggested
several
times,
my
understanding
is
at
least
that
you
cannot
collaterally
attack
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
who
entered
the
order
it
did.
and
the
only
claim
that
you
can
make
now
is
that
the
order
by
its
terms
did
not
cover
your
cases.
do
you
agree?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
a
question
of
the
scope
of
the
order?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
didn't
mean
to
cut
you
off.
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
then
raise
a
question
there?
i
mean,
i
think
there
is
a
legitimate
question
about
that,
given
the
--
given
the
rather
general
terms
of
the
--
of
the
scope
of
the
order.
and
i
would
like
your
response
to
this.
it
seems
to
me
as
a
background
consideration
that
we
should
have
in
mind
in
interpreting
how
broad
that
order
was.
it's
been
raised
a
couple
times;
justice
breyer
raised
it
a
moment
ago.
and
it's
this:
it
is
one
argument
to
say
that
the
bankruptcy
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
and
derivatively
an
order
that
it
issued
should
not
be
interpreted
to
cover
any
claim
that
does
not
affect
or
cannot
deplete
the
bankruptcy
estate
taken
as
a
given
fact
at
the
time
this
later
case
is
brought.
another
view
of
jurisdiction
would
be
that
the
bankruptcy
court
has
jurisdiction
and
hence
an
order
might
be
interpreted
to
cover
any
cases
which,
if
contemplated,
would
have
precluded
the
settlement
that
created
the
bankruptcy
estate.
if
travelers
had
thought
that
it
was
going
to
be
liable
for
these
cases
of
insurer
misconduct,
it
might
very
well
have
said:
we're
not
forking
over
x
hundred
millions
of
dollars,
leaving
this
exposure
open.
so
that
the
bankruptcy
estate
would
never
have
attained
the
size
that
it
had
attained
if
the
--
if
the
insurer
and
everybody
else
had
not
understood
that
these
later
claims
would
be
--
were
being
cut
off.
is
that
argument
a
relevant
--
number
one,
is
that
a
--
a
legitimate
jurisdictional
argument?
and
number
two,
is
it
a
relevant
argument
that
we
should
bear
in
mind
--
in
trying
to
figure
out
how
broad
the
'86
order
really
was?
justice
david
h.
souter
everybody
accepts
it's
at
least
that
much.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
it
the
case,
to
make
sure
i
understand
it,
the
wise
complaints
are
the
--
are
the
exception?
they
are
the
only
complaints,
as
i
understand
it
in
this
current
round
of
litigation,
that
claims
that
the
actual
harm
to
them
resulted
from
actions
other
than
actions
of
manville.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
understand
--
or
maybe
i
don't
--
maybe
i
don't
understand
the
--
every
step
in
the
liability
claim.
my
only
question
was,
among
the
plaintiffs,
is
it
correct
that
the
only
plaintiffs
who
claim
they
were
hurt
physically
by
asbestos
as
a
result
of
the
actions
of
somebody,
the
only
ones
who
are
claiming
that
the
somebody
was
other
than
manville
are
the
wise
plaintiffs.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
no?
justice
david
h.
souter
simply
because
of
manville's
position
in
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
that
--
so
that
you
are
saying
in
effect
everybody
ultimately
is
claiming
against
manville,
the
wise
plaintiffs
and
every
other
set
of
plaintiffs
in
this
--
in
this
group
of
direct
liability
claimants?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
--
i
understand
your
cause
of
action.
okay.
i
don't
want
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
as
part
of
the
1986
reorganization
plan
of
the
johns-manville
corporation,
an
asbestos
company,
the
bankruptcy
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
approved
a
settlement
providing
that
manville’s
insurers,
including
the
travelers
indemnity
company
and
related
entities,
would
contribute
to
a
trust
to
provide
compensation
to
present
and
future
asbestos
claimants
and
that
in
exchange
the
insurers
would
be
released
from
all
of
what
the
settlement
called
“policy
claims.”
policy
claims
would
instead
by
channelled
to
the
trust
and
the
court
enjoined
bringing
any
such
claims
against
travelers.
the
court
orders
adopting
the
settlement
agreement
and
reorganization
plan
including
the
injunction
were
affirmed
on
direct
appeal.
over
a
decade
later,
however,
asbestos
claimants
started
bringing
state
court
actions
against
travelers,
alleging
that
travelers
had
itself
violated
state
lore
in
connection
with
asbestos
claims.
travelers
returned
to
the
bankruptcy
court
arguing
that
the
state
court
actions
were
barred
by
the
court's
1986
injunction.
the
parties
subsequently
entered
into
a
settlement
contingent
on
the
bankruptcy
court's
issuing
order
--
an
order
clarifying
that
the
state
lore
actions
are
and
always
have
been
barred
by
the
1986
injunction.
the
bankruptcy
court
issued
such
an
order
and
the
district
court
affirmed.
the
second
circuit,
however,
reversed.
it
agreed
that
the
actions
against
travelers
fall
within
the
liberal
scope
of
the
1986
injunction
but
concluded
that
the
bankruptcy
court
had
exceeded
its
jurisdiction
in
1986
when
it
enjoined
those
claims.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse.
we
agree
with
the
circuit
that
the
state
actions
constitute
policy
claims
under
the
terms
of
the
1986
injunction.
the
1986
injunction
defines
that
term
broadly
to
include
not
on
the
claims,
but
even
the
allegations
based
upon
arising
out
of
or
relating
to
travelers'
insurance
coverage
of
manville.
the
extensive
factual
findings
of
the
bankruptcy
court
on
challenge
here
make
clear
that
state
actions
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
injunction.
but
we
part
ways
with
the
court
of
appeals
at
its
jurisdictional
analysis.
the
1986
injunction
became
final
over
two
decades
ago
and
it
is
res
judicata
to
the
parties
who
were
before
the
bankruptcy
court
and
to
those
in
privity
with
them.
whether
that
injunction
was
a
proper
exercise
of
the
bankruptcy
court
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
1986
was
not
properly
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
2008
and
it's
not
properly
before
us.
there
is
no
question
that
the
bankruptcy
court
has
jurisdiction
today
to
enforce
the
terms
of
its
prior
order
and
that
is
all
it
did.
our
decision
is
a
narrow
one.
we
do
not
resolve
whether
the
bankruptcy
court
in
1986
or
today
could
properly
enjoin
claims
against
a
non-debtor,
such
as
travelers,
for
its
own
independent
wrongdoing.
nor
do
we
decide
whether
any
particular
claimant
or
entity
is
in
fact
bound
by
the
1986
injunction.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
joins.
