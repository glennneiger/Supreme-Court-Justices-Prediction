chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-295,
travelers
indemnity
company
v.
bailey,
and
common
law
settlement
counsel
v.
bailey.
mr.
ostrager.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
--
if
part
of
the
settlement
--
i
mean,
travelers
says,
we
need
to
get
more
out
of
this
before
we're
going
to
put
in
all
the
policy
funds.
the
bankruptcy
judge
says,
well,
you
are
going
to
be
immune
from
any
traffic
accident
liability.
and
there
is
a
traffic
accident,
and
travelers
said,
well,
the
bankruptcy
court
said
i
don't
have
to
pay.
is
that
all
right?
it's
within
the
jurisdiction
as
you
read
it
because
it
involves
travelers,
it's
related
to
the
funds
they
submitted
into
the
trust
account.
is
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
i
know
they
that
didn't
intend
anything
with
respect
to
traffic
accidents.
but
my
question
is
how
far
does
your
theory
reach?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
there
would
be
jurisdiction
in
the
hypothetical
that
i
posed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
on
direct
appeal.
are
you
suggesting
it
would
be
barred
--
that
travelers
would
have
protection
under
a
collateral
attack?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that?
it
--
it
involves
one
--
it
involves
the
insurance
company,
its
coverage
of
johns-manville.
and
the
travelers
is
saying:
look,
we
are
not
going
to
do
it
unless
you
give
us
this
--
this
broader
immunity.
and
the
bankruptcy
judge
does
it.
i
don't
know
why
it
would
be
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
it's
clearly
related
to
allowing
the
settlement
to
go
forward.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
issacharoff.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
cohn.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
doesn't
the
due
process
clause
fully
protect
you?
if
the
bankruptcy
court
made
a
mistake
and
purported
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
your
claims,
then
i
suppose
you
have,
in
particular
cases
if
you
can
establish
it,
a
due
process
claim
that
fully
protects
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
saw
in
the
--
i
guess
it
was
in
the
travelers'
reply
brief,
the
suggestion
that
there
was
a
future
--
somebody
representing
future
claimants.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
that
limitation
spelled
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
a
description
of
the
clients
at
issue
here?
they've
been
--
they've
all
been
exposed
to
asbestos?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know,
but
i'm
asking
about
the
claimants.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
five
minutes,
mr.
ostrager.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
today
in
case
08-295,
travelers
indemnity
company
versus
bailey
and
the
consolidated
case.
