was
the
second
circuit's
decision
based
on
an
interpretation
of
the
confirmation
order
or
was
it
based
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
didn't
this--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--isn't
that
what
the
congress
gave
them
in
the
1994
bankruptcy
act?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
dispute
the
proposition
that
that
statute
was
passed
in
large
part
for
the
purpose
of
codifying
what
was
done
in
this
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
sort
of
thing
that
was
done
in
this
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
not
the
case
that
most
of
the
claims
are
claims
based
on
--
based
on
manville?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
relating
to
what
travelers
did
in
relation
to
manville,
rather
than
other
companies.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
you're
--
you're
making
the
argument
that
some
of
these
claims
concern
things
that
travelers
did
in
relation
to
the
defense
of
other
asbestos
manufacturers.
now,
maybe
that
means
that
the
--
the
bankruptcy
court
interpreted
the
order
too
broadly
or
--
in
that
respect.
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
main
issue
here?
