justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ostrager,
you
have
characterized
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
a
way
the
second
circuit
did
not.
the
second
circuit
said:
the
confirmation
of
the
1986
order
stands,
but
that
order
did
not
encompass
what
was
added
in
2004;
that
is,
that
order
dealt
with
the
debtor,
with
manville
and
the
insurers'
obligation
to
cover
manville's
liability.
the
second
circuit
said:
now,
this
2004
order,
which
concerns
independent
actions
against
insurers
for
their
own
wrong,
was
never
encompassed
in
the
order
that
they
affirmed.
so
i
think
it's
quite
unfair
to
say
it's
a
collateral
attack
on
the
1986
order.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
the
time
of
the
1986
order,
had
these
independent
actions
started?
i
thought
at
the
time
of
the
1986
order
the
concerns
were
suits
involving
manville's
liability
and
the
insurers'
derivative
obligation
to
cover.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
insurers,
to
the
extent
of
the
insurance
proceeds.
that's
what
created
the
pot
that
made
the
settlement
fund.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
this
extra
piece,
because
the
only
information
we
have
is
that
manville
--
there
was
the
conversation
that's
reported
in
the
chubb
brief.
this
question
came
up,
well,
what
about
actions
against
the
insurers
for
their
own
wrongs?
and
the
answer
was,
oh,
those
aren't
covered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
second
circuit's
view
was
that
the
bankruptcy
court
has
no
authority,
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
when
the
debtor
--
debtor's
liability
is
not
in
question.
the
second
circuit
thought,
rightly
or
wrongly,
that
when
the
liability
is
between
two
--
the
question
is
between
two
non-debtors,
travelers
on
the
one
hand,
the
claimants
on
the
other,
manville
is
not
in
the
picture.
that's
what
the
second
circuit
said,
it
falls
outside
the
domain
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
and
that
could
be
wrong
or
it
could
be
right.
but
in
the
second
circuit's
view
the
bankruptcy
court
lacked
authority
to
deal
with
the
nondebtors'
liability
to
the
claimants.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
direct
actions
against
travelers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
these
were
cases
in
the
state
courts
and,
as
i
understand
it,
so
far
none
of
them
has
succeeded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
can
you
say
they
ignored
it
when
they
had
several
pages
devoted
to
524,
and
they
said
it
was
--
it
didn't
cover
these
so-called
direct
actions,
which
really
aren't
what
we
generally
call
"direct
actions".
but
the
second
circuit
did
address
what
congress
did
to
codify
essentially
the
manville
device.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
because
you
told
me
that
the
second
circuit
ignored
524(g),
and
i'm
looking
at
page
33a
of
the
petition
for
cert,
and
the
second
circuit
addresses
524(g),
and
its
discussion
continues
for
a
couple
pages.
i
don't
see
how
that's
ignoring
the
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
have
an
answer
to
my
question
about
the
second
circuit
ignoring
524(g)
when
they
devoted
two
and
a
half
pages
to
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--another
mystery
in
this
most
mysterious
case:
if
it
was
so
clear
that
the
original
order,
the
1986
order,
ensured
travelers
that
it
would
have
no
liability
for
asbestos
claims,
period,
then
why
did
it
put
up
$400
million,
much
more
than
it
put
up
originally,
in
order
to
settle
with
people
who
were
bringing
precisely
that
kind
of
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
difference
between
the
release
that
you
say
flowed
from
the
1986
order
and
the
releases
that
were
obtained
with
the
$400
million?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
specifically
what
was
not
included
in
the
1986
release
that
was
included
as
a
result
of
the
settlement
negotiations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
would
like
to
know
the
difference.
what
would
--
what
would
travelers
be
liable
for
under
the
1986
order
as
you
read
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
they
got
freedom
from
as
a
result
of
this
settlement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
--
so
that
the
2000
clarification
order
did
exonerate
them
from
traffic
accidents?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
have
one
question
before
you
reserve
the
rest
of
your
time.
that
is,
you
said
this
is
--
this
was
a
sweeping
release
that
travelers
got
in
settlement
for
the
claims
of
many
parties.
but
some
people
were
not
there,
and
those
are
the
people
who
still
want
to
bring
their
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
haven't
asked
my
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
would
like
to
know
what
--
what
notice
did
the
people
who
were
left
out
of
the
settlement,
who
were
not
part
of
the
settlement,
who
say,
so
we
want
our
day
in
court
--
what
notice
did
they
have
and
what
opportunity
to
be
heard?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
can
it
be
successive
when
they
didn't
even
get
their
--
i
mean
they
--
these
people
haven't
had
a
day
in
court.
they
may
have
a
claim
that's
no
good.
all
state
courts
so
far
have
said
their
claim
is
no
good.
but
they
have
a
right
to
sue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
rule
--
the
particular
rule
that
i
am
asking
you
about
is
that
people
who
have
not
had
their
day
in
court
can
be
precluded--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
the
basis
of
newspaper
notice
and
radio
announcements?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
the
best
possible
notice,
which
included
regular
mail
notice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
answer
the
question
--
practically
the
insurers
would
not
have
settled,
there
would
have
been
no
1986
order,
if
they
didn't
have
this
broader
liability?
they
say
without
global
protection
they
never
would
have
contributed
to
the
trust
fund.
and
i'd
like
you
to
answer
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
in
the
--
at
the
time
of
1986,
there
were
many
claims
against
manville,
of
course,
for
manville's
liability.
these
later
suits
--
these
in
state
court
about
the
insurance
company's
independent
obligation
--
i
asked
this
to
counsel
on
the
other
side
--
to
what
extent
was
there
such
litigation
in
1986?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
the
dissenting
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
are
two
decisions
of
this
court,
amchem
and
ortiz,
that
reject
that
position.
