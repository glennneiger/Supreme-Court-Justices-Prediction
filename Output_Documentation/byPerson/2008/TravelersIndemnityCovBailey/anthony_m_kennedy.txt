justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
to
the
1986
order
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
might
have
answered
the
question
posed
by
the
chief
justice
with
the
traffic
accident
hypothetical:
that
is
an
interesting
question
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
maybe
there
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
maybe
there
isn't,
but
that
issue
as
to
the
1986
order
is
final.
now,
that
brings
us
to
the
--
the
later
order,
2004,
2006.
and
then
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that's
just
a
reiteration
of
the
earlier
order
or
a
further
expansion
of
jurisdiction
that
can
be
reached.
why
couldn't
the
counsel
for
petitioner
have
given
that
answer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
putting
aside
questions
of
notice,
if
these
parties
had
been
represented
in
the
appeal
of
the
1986
order,
maybe
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
ruling
was
correct;
maybe
it
was
incorrect;
but
it's
done.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
it's
just
a
question
of
personal
jurisdiction
and
notice.
it's
not
a
question
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
subject
matter
jurisdiction
can
be
concluded
in
an
earlier
order
and
there
can
be
no
collateral
attack
if
you've
been
a
party.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
settlement
clauses
often
release
future
claims.
it's
standard
stuff
in
a
release
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
that
is
foreclosed.
now,
if
you
are
talking
about
personal
jurisdiction
that
may
be
something
else.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
talking
about
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
that
has
been
foreclosed
by
the
earlier
circuit
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
and
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
we
are
reviewing
now
seems
to
conflate
that
issue.
