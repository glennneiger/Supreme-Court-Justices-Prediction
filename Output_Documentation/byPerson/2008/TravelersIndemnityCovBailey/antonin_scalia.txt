justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
is
a
distinction
between
jurisdiction
and
whether
the
action
taken
by
the
bankruptcy
court
comes
within
the
statute.
but
at
some
point,
at
some
point
surely
the
two
overlap.
i
mean,
suppose
--
you
know,
you
say
simply
because
it
is
a
bankruptcy
action
it
comes
within
the
bankruptcy
clause
and
there
is
jurisdiction.
but
what
if
the
bankruptcy
court
in
connection
with
the
bankruptcy
decrees
that
a
totally
unrelated
company
has
to
pay
a
certain
amount
of
money
and
it's
conceded
that
this
company
has
no
relation
to
the
bankruptcy,
but
the
court
says,
this
is
a
national
problem
and
this
other
company
ought
to
contribute?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
would
be
within
the
bankruptcy
power?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can
do
anything
under
the
bankruptcy
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
that's
fine.
i'm
not
arguing
about
that.
i'm
arguing
about
the
principle
that
you
are
asking
us
to
accept,
to
wit,
that
this
challenge
cannot
possibly
be
based
upon
jurisdiction.
surely,
there
are
some
things
that
simply
do
not
fall
within
the
bankruptcy
power.
isn't
that
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
and
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
what
you
are
saying
is
this
does
fall
within
the
bankruptcy
power.
but
don't
tell
us
that
it
is
not
a
challenge
based
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
based
exclusively
upon
the
statute.
it
could
be
based
upon
both.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
acknowledge
that
that's
not
true.
you
acknowledge
that
--
that
they
couldn't
have
issued
the
hypothetical
order
that
the
chief
justice
proposed,
even
if
that
was
necessary,
even
if
--
even
if
travelers
said,
we
will
not
kick
in
the
money
up
to
the
limits
of
our
liability
unless
you
make
us
immune
from
all
traffic
accidents.
you
acknowledged
that
that's
no
good,
right?
