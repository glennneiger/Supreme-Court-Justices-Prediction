mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1988,
the
second
circuit
decided
in
two
separate
decisions
that
a
bankruptcy
court
exercising
its
core
jurisdiction
had
properly
confirmed
the
plan
of
reorganization
that
resolved
present
and
future
claims
against
johns-manville
and
the
insurers
who
funded
manville's
reorganization
plan.
last
year,
despite
its
decades-old
rulings
to
the
contrary,
the
second
circuit
sustained
a
collateral
attack
on
the
confirmation
order
and
held
that
the
bankruptcy
court
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction
back
in
1986
to
enjoin
direct
actions
against
travelers,
quote,
"based
upon,
arising
out
of,
or
related
to.
"
close
quote--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--justice
ginsburg,
the
bankruptcy
court
judge,
interpreting
his
own
order,
explicitly
held
that
the
1986
order
was
intended
and
was
always
intended
to
enjoin
direct
actions
against
travelers
based
upon,
arising
out
of,
or
relating
to
the
insurance
policies
manville
purchased
from
travelers.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
justice
ginsburg,
at
the
time
of
the
1986
order
there
had
been
various
forms
of
direct
action
filed
against
manville,
and
the
bankruptcy
court
concluded,
and
the
second
circuit
recognized,
that
a
settlement
with
the
insurers
was
essential
for
the
reorganization
and
rehabilitation
of
manville--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--the
plan
of
reorganization
as
ultimately
confirmed
contained
the
language
to
which
i
directed
the
court.
it
--
a
plan
of
confirmation
included
all
aspects
of
the
resolution
of
the
manville
estate.
the
confirmation
order
was
all
about
ensuring
fairness
to
all
claimants.
it
was
all
about
expanding
the
value
of
the
estate,
and
it
was
all
about
rehabilitating
the
debtor
for
the
benefit
of
its
employees,
suppliers,
and
local
claimants.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
it
did.
it
did,
yes.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
you
are
right
on
the
record
point.
however,
judge
lifland
in
the
hearings
that
were
associated
with
his
clarifying
order
was
very
explicit
that
he
used
the
words
"based
upon,
arising
out
of,
or
related
to.
"
for
the
express
purpose
of
granting
travelers
the
broadest
relief
that
could
be
afforded
to
travelers
post-confirmation.
and--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--well,
he
certainly
intended
to
make
the
cornerstone
of
the
manville
reorganization
work.
and
as
the
second
circuit
itself
held,
in
a
subsequent
collateral
attack,
the
o'malley
case
--
reported
at
100
f.
3d
944,
a
1996
case
where
there
was
a
challenge
to
the
bankruptcy
court's
reaffirmation
and
continuation
of
the
'86
order,
the
second
circuit
held
in
1996
that
such
an
injunction
is
essential
to
the
success
of
the
settlement,
and
its
continuation
was
well
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
the
second
circuit
order
was
explicitly
predicated
on
the
theory
that
the
bankruptcy
court
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction
back
in
1986
to
enjoin
these
direct
actions.
now,
we
submit
that
the
second
circuit
clearly
erred,
because
it
conflated
the
entirely
distinct
concept
of
a
court's
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
the
propriety
of
the
court's
exercise
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
this
was
a
distinction
that
this
court
expressly
recognized
75
years
ago
in
the
continental
illinois
v.
rock
island
railroad.
there's
no--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--justice
scalia--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--justice
scalia,
clearly
the
congress
in
fashioning
over
the
years
expansive
safeguards
facilitating
growth
and
change
in
the
bankruptcy
law
as
our
nation's
commerce
has
grown
has
done
that.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
no.
subject
to
appropriate
safeguards.
now,
in
order
to
confirm
a
plan
of
reorganization
a
--
a
debtor
must
meet
all
16
requirements
of
section
1129.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
i
would
agree
that
that
is
so.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
this
is
not
our
case.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
justice
scalia,
i
would
say
that
the
bankruptcy
court
in
this
case
unquestionably
had
jurisdiction
over
the
manville
reorganization
under
28
u.s.c.
1334(b)
as
the
manville
reorganization
was
a
civil
proceeding
arising
under
title
11
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
there
were,
justice
ginsburg,
60
pages
of
findings
of
fact
indicating
that
the
direct
action
suits
against
manville
was
an
end
run
around
the--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--against
travelers
were
an
end
run
around
the
discharge
of
manville,
and
that
all
of
the
claims
against
travelers
arose
out
of
and
flowed
to
the
insurance
relationship.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
well,
what
--
the
reason
that
this
is
so
critical
is
that,
as
the--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--they
do
not
seek
assets
of
the
estate,
although
travelers
would
potentially
have
contribution
claims
against
manville
because
all
of
the
claims--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--the
respondents
actually
concede
that
bankruptcy
courts
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
actions
against
non-debtors
in
appropriate
circumstances.
that's
the
chubb
brief
at
pages
22
and
40.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
justice
stevens,
you
are
absolutely
right
that
these
direct
action
cases
have
never
been
sustained
because
they
all
relate
to
the
discharge
by
travelers
of
travelers'
obligations
as
manville's
insurer,
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
bankruptcy
court
judge
issued
the
injunction.
now,
the
second--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--that
is
correct.
the
second
circuit
also
completely
ignored
the
enactment
by
congress
of
sections
524(g)
and
(h)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
which
are
modeled
on
the
manville
reorganization,
and
expressly
grandfather
the
manville
injunction
as
a
final
order
that
could
not
be
revoked.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
524(g)
specifically
says
that
asbestos
--
asbestos
channeling
injunction
"shall
be
valid
and
enforceable
and
may
not
be
revoked
or
modified
by
any
court
except
through
direct
appeal.
"
and
524(h)(i)
specifically
says
that
the
pre-1994
asbestos
channeling
injunctions
shall
be
considered
to
meet
all
of
the
requirements
of
524(g)(2),
which
is
in
our
appendix
at
page
471,
which
means
that
they
automatically
meet
524(g)(3)(a)(i)
and
may
not
be
revoked
or
modified
except
through
appeal.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
the
essential
issue
here,
justice
stevens,
is
that
there
would
have
been
no
manville
reorganization--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--it's
been
a
remarkable
success.
asbestos
claimants
have
received
--
660,000
asbestos
claimants
have
received--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--more
than
$2.8
billion.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
but
the
point
is
that
there
couldn't
have
been
have
a
manville
reorganization
without
the
insurance
settlements.
the
second
circuit
recognized
that.
the
second
circuit
further
recognized
that
these
direct
actions
violate
the
express
terms
of
the
injunction
that
judge
lifland,
the
bankruptcy
judge,
granted
in
this
case.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
the
--
524(g)(4)(a)(2)(iii)
specifically
authorizes
asbestos
channeling
injunctions
that
bar
any
claim
against
the
third
party
to
be
directly
or
indirectly
liable
for
claims
against
the
debtor.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
mr.
chief
justice,
that
would
not
be
covered,
and
that
is
certainly
not
what
the
bankruptcy
court
intended
or
said.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
katz
case
that
bankruptcy
extends
beyond
the
res.
and--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--not
in
the
hypothetical
you
posed.
on
direct
appeal
that
would
clearly
be
excluded
because
it
wouldn't
meet--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--well,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
reach
that
issue
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
that,
in
connection
with
exercising
its
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
manville
reorganization,
the
bankruptcy
court
had
the
power
under
section
105
of
the
bankruptcy
code
to
issue
any
order,
process,
or
judgment
necessary
or
appropriate
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
title
11.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
in
this
order,
the
--
the
limitation
on
the
injunction
was
based
upon
"arising
out
of
or
related
to.
"
i
would
submit
that
the
traffic
accident
falls
outside
the
scope
of
that.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
well,
i
--
i
think
we
have
an
act
of
congress,
524(g)
and
(h),
which--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--with
--
with
respect,
i
believe
that
there
are
express
findings
of
fact
that
the
bankruptcy
court
made
which
were
adopted
by
the
district
court,
which
were
embraced
in
full
by
the
second
circuit,
and
we
have
a
--
a
pure
issue
of
law
here.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
i
believe
that
they
clearly
misinterpreted
the
intent
of
524(g)
and
(h).
they
clearly
misperceived
the
fact
that
congress
had
expressly
grandfathered
the
manville
injunction--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--in
524(g).
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
during
the
course
of
the
5
years
of
proceedings
before
the
bankruptcy
court,
the
case
was
referred
to
mediation
before
the
honorable
mario
cuomo.
and
in
connection
with
that
mediation,
there
was
a
business
decision
made
to
secure
releases
much
broader
than
the
injunction
that
was
contained.
travelers
would,
in
connection
with
the
mediation
process,
participate
in
a
settlement.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
one
was
a
general
--
one
was
a
general
release
and
the
other
was
a
release
based
upon,
arising
out
of,
or
related
to
the
manville
insurance
policies
that
travelers
purchased--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--it
--
an
absolute,
broad
general
release
by
80,000
people.
now,
i
want
to--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--potentially--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--potentially
the
traffic
accident
that
mr.
chief
justice
referenced.
i
want
to
reserve--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--it's
a
general
release.
i
--
i
want
to
conclude
and
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
by
noting
that
"redefining
the
scope
of
a
long-final
confirmation
order
unravels
intricate
transactions
so
as
to
knock
the
props
out
from
under
the
authorization
for
every
transaction
that
has
taken
place.
"
that's
a
quote
from
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
chateaugay
corp.,
10
f.
3d
944.
and
that
creates
an
unmanageable,
uncontrollable
situation
for
courts
and
litigants
alike.
we
have--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--i
would
say
that
the--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
there
was
broad
notice
to
the
people
who
would
be
affected
by
the
issuance
of
the
injunction.
this
court
has
recognized--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--there
were
newspaper
blasts
repeatedly,
all
sorts
of
public
notice,
radio
announcements.
but
we
are
dealing
with
a
special
remedial
scheme
that
expressly
forecloses
successive
litigation
by
non-litigants,
and
in
the
bankruptcy
context--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--this
is
what
congress
has
made
provision
for
in
524(g)
and
(h).
this
is
what
i
believe
the
court
contemplated
in
ortiz
at
page
846,
also
in
martin
v.
wilks,
also
in
taylor
v.
sturgell.
and
i
think
this
rule
was
foreshadowed
as
long
ago
as
mullane
v.
central
hanover
trust
company.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
yes.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
as
the
court
said
in
mullane,
that
"beneficiaries
whose
interests
are
either
conjectural
or
future,
or
although
they
could
be--
"
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--not
--
not
with
respect
to
future
claimants
who
haven't
had
any
disease.
there
has
to
be
finality.
that's
what
524(g)
and
(h)
says.
a
confirmation
order
has
to
be
final.
as
the
court
said
in
stoll,
there
has
to
be
a
beginning
of
litigation
and
a
place
to
end
litigation.
i'd
like
to
reserve,
if
i
may,
with
respect,
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
thank
you.
i
have
five
quick
points
i
want
to
make.
first,
the
second
circuit
upheld
the
core
factual
findings
that,
quote,
"the
instant
claims
against
travelers
arise
out
of
its
provision
of
insurance
coverage
to
manville.
"
close
quote.
that's
from
the
second
circuit
opinion.
it's
in
the
appendix
at
page
33.
second,
there
is
no
use
of
the
word
524(g).
524(g),
about
which
we
haven't
spoken
enough,
clearly
and
unmistakably
reflects
congress's
intent
to
allow
channeling
injunctions
that
bar
claims
against
a
debtor
and
those,
like
insurers,
who
are
directly
or
indirectly
liable
for
claims
against
the
debtor.
that's
524(g)(4)(a)(ii)
and
roman
(iii).
524(g)
expressly
provides
an
asbestos
channeling
injunction
shall
be
valid
and
enforceable
and
may
not
be
revoked
or
modified
by
any
court
except
for
an
appeal.
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
the
fact
that
a
senate
report
accompanying
an
earlier
version
of
the
bill
clarified
that
524(g)
is
--
quote,
"is
not
meant
to
give
the
bankruptcy
courts
authority
which
they
do
not
already
possess
and
simply
codifies
a
court
's
ability
to
issue
supplemental
permanent
injunctions
which
are
irrevocable
except
on
appeal.
"
there
is
a
final
judgment
in
this
case
confirming
the
plan
of
reorganization.
the
second
circuit
issued
that
--
confirmed
that
judgment
twice,
once
in
the
macarthur
case
and
once
in
the
kane
case.
and
then
in
the
o'malley
case,
which
is
a
1996
case,
the
second
circuit
rejected
a
collateral
attack
on
the
confirmation
order
on
two
grounds.
first,
they
found
that
the
performance
of
the
futures
representative
that
judge
lifland
had
appointed
and
which
was
incorporated
in
524(g),
modeled
on
the
manville
reorganization
proceeding
--
the
second
circuit
found
that
the
legal
representative,
quote,
"took
an
active
and
aggressive
role
in
protecting
future
claimants
in
this
litigation.
"
and,
secondly,
the
second
circuit
rejected
the
challenge
to
the
continuation
of
the
1986
order
enjoining
the
suits
against
the
insurers
as
being
without
merit
because
such
an
injunction
was
essential
to
the
success
of
the
settlement,
and
its
continuation
was
well
within
the
court's
discretion.
as
respects
chubb,
judge
koeltl
in
affirming
judge
lifland's
2004
order,
specifically
found
that
chubb,
a
multinational
insurer
that
has
paid
more
than
a
billion
dollars
to
resolve
asbestos-related
claims,
was
clearly
on
notice
of
these
proceedings.
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief,
on
pages
10
and
11,
several
524(g)
injunctions
that
have
run
to
the
benefit
of
chubb
which
contain
the
exact
same
"based
upon,
arising
out
of,
or
related
to.
"
language
that
appears
in
the
original
manville
order.
we
didn't
cite
--
but
it's
a
matter
of
public
record
--
that
chubb
paid
$550
million
to
resolve
through
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
in
fibreboard
liabilities
relating
to
fibreboard
receiving
the
same
protection.
the
manville
plan
carries
out
the
core
values
of
bankruptcy.
the
manville
trust
has
made
payments
to
660,000
asbestos
claimants
--
that's
at
record
at
139
--
funded
by
$2.8
million
of
proceeds
from
insurance
settlements
and
the
sale
of
the
reorganized
and
rehabilitated
manville--
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--precisely.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
and
i
--
i
wanted
to
point
out
that,
in
your
dissent
in
the
ortiz
case,
you
said
that
"judges
can
and
should
search
aggressively
for
ways
within
the
framework
of
existing
law
to
avoid
delay
and
expense
so
great
as
to
bring
about
a
massive
denial
of
justice--
"
mr.
barry
r.
ostrager
--i
