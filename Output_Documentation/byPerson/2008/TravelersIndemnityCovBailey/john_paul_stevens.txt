mr.
ostrager,
may
i
ask
this
question?
i
--
i
was
unable
to
find
the
complaints
in
the
voluminous
filings
here.
do
any
of
the
plaintiffs'
cases
seek
recovery
from
assets
of
the
estate
that
would
reduce
the
payments
to
creditors
of
manville?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
answer
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
--
but
why
does
a
bankruptcy
court
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
third-party
actions
against
some
creditor
of
the
estate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
those
actions
won't
affect
the
estate
at
all,
i
just
don't
understand
sort
of
the
basic
theory,
and
i
don't
really
understand
the
theory
of
the
plaintiffs'
cases,
either.
i
don't
understand
--
i
can't
figure
out
what
anybody
expects
to
collect
from
travelers
for
what
they
did.
the
fact
that
they
defended
cases
certainly
was
--
was
proper
for
them
as
an
insurance
company.
this
is
mysterious
case
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
--
how
do
these
pending
actions
have
any
impact
on
fulfilling
the
objections
--
objectives
of
the
channeling
instruction
or
affect
the
disposition
of
the
assets
in
the
estate?
i
just
don't
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there
has
been
one
and
it's
been
a
success.
justice
john
paul
stevens
none
of
whom
would
be
affected--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
none
of
whom
would
be
affected
if
these
suits
go
forward,
as
i
understand
it.
i'm
missing
something
very
important,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
it
harmless
error?
