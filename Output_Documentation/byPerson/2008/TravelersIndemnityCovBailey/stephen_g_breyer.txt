justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
there's
a
notice
question.
i
thought
there
were
5,538
plaintiffs
here
and
--
that
you
represent,
and
every
one
of
them
has
already
gotten
money
from
the
trust
except
for
two
who
have
filed
claims
against
it.
so
i
imagine
if
that's
so,
they
certainly
know
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
there
is
no
notice
problem.
if
there
were
a
notice
problem,
i
guess
there
would
be
a
due
process
problem.
so,
i
don't
see
what
notice
has
any
more
to
do
with
this
than
the
ncaa
tournament.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
the
original
confirmation,
there
are
problems
in
asbestos
cases,
like
other
bankruptcy
cases,
of
giving
people
notice.
bankrupt
people
often
give
notice
to
many
who
aren't
there.
and
i
don't
know
that
--
maybe
there's
a
constitutional
problem
with
some
of
them,
but
i
would
have
thought
jurisdiction
under
the
statute
is
clear.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
what
is
--
is
this
about
notice?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
didn't
think
so.
i
thought
this
was
about
the
case
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
in
the
statute
that
they
have
authority
in
the
bankruptcy
court
to
issue
any
order,
process,
or
judgment
that
is
necessary
or
appropriate
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
title.
and
we've
said
that
the
test
is
whether
the
outcome
of
the
proceeding
--
this
is
the
other
state
proceeding
--
could
conceivably
have
any
effect
on
the
estate
being
administered
in
bankruptcy.
so,
as
i
understood
it,
that's
the
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
--
that's
what
this
court
said.
now,
they
may
be
few
and
far
between,
an
order
like
this,
but
where
there
are
special
reasons
for
it
--
suppose
it's
a
pension
fund,
and
you
want
to
reorganize
the
company,
and
this
is
the
employees'
--
they're
--
the
employees'
pension
fund
is
worried
about
claims
which
are
related
directly.
or
suppose
it's
an
officer,
or
suppose
it's
a
worker,
and
to
reorganize
the
company
you
must
cut
the
claims
off.
and
otherwise,
it
is
down
the
drain
for
everyone,
no
more
money
in
the
fund,
no
more
jobs
for
the
employees.
now,
what
is
it
here
that
would
say
there
is
no
special
circumstance
such
that
a
bankruptcy
judge
can
ever
do
it,
no
matter
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
what
you
are
saying
also
true
of
the
various
other
asbestos
cases
that
have,
i
think,
done
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
of
course,
this
has
enormous
practical
impact
on
the
debtor.
if
not
him
--
not
this
one,
because
it's
already
a
done
deal
--
you
will
never
get
insurance
companies--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
go
into
this
kind
of
thing
if
they
are
going
to
be
sued
for
the
very
act
of
helping
the
debtor
defend
the
asbestos
cases.
and
so,
i
can't
imagine
an
insurance
company
in
its
right
mind
going
into
that
when
in
fact
all
these
suits
are
still
open.
that
presumably
is
why
the
bankruptcy
judge
cut
it
off.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
does
it
say
--
it
doesn't
say
that.
what
it
says
in
the
release
is
it
says:
we
are
releasing
or
everybody
is
enjoined
from
bringing
a
suit
for
policy
claims
against
travelers,
and
a
policy
claim
is
any
and
all
claims
based
upon,
arising
out
of,
or
relating
to
any
insurance
policy.
and
then
the
bankruptcy
judge,
in
thousands
of
findings,
i
guess,
said
that
your
lawsuits
do
relate
to
the
relevant
insurance
policies.
indeed,
the
claims
are
based
upon
the
joint
--
the
obligation
of
travelers
to
defend
those
very
policies,
given
the
obligation
to
defend
johns-manville.
so
the
relation
is
exceedingly
close,
and
the
language
covers
it,
and
there
are
thousands
of
pages
of
findings,
i
guess,
that
show
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
view,
if
smith
has
a
$2
billion
or
$4
billion
claim
against
company
x
and
the
pension
fund
together,
company
x
is
in
bankruptcy,
and
so
the
judge
says:
i
want
to
enjoin
this
claim,
we
will
settle
it,
you
know,
but
the
pension
fund
--
doesn't
--
doesn't
the
bankruptcy
judge
--
if
in
fact
without
the
pension
fund
you
couldn't
reorganize,
wouldn't
the
bankruptcy
judge
have
authority
to
cut
off
the
claim
against
the
pension
fund?
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
company
goes
down
the
drain
or
whether
it
doesn't.
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
pension
fund
was
all
mixed
up
in
this
together.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
there
is
nothing
here
in
indemnity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
would
be
true
of
all
the
workforce
and
they
have
claims
against
the
individual
members
of
the
workforce?
they
have
--
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
an
unusual
case,
i
agree
with
you
on
that,
but
to
say
never
--
to
say
never
is
what's
bothering
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
not
--
because
there
is
a
good
constitutional
protection;
it's
called
the
due
process
clause.
if
the
bankruptcy
judge
goes
too
far,
it's
a
due
process
violation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there's
language,
broad
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who
stated
it?
who
stated
that?
i
mean,
when
i
--
i
read
what
the
judge
said
at
the
time.
i've
read
language
of
the
order,
and
i
haven't
found
there
anything
that
said
that.
what
it
talked
about
was
policies
that
were
seriously
intertwined
with
the
liability
of
manville.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
the
confirmation
order?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
different.
okay.
so
the
confirmation
order--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
there's
another
piece
of
paper
called
"the
insurance
settlement
order",
which
says
that
the
confirmation
order
and
all
these
other
definitions
and
the
injunction
just
refer
to
derivative
liability?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no?
okay.
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
i
don't
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
that's
a
different
definition
than
the
definition
of
"policy
claims"
in
the
injunction,
presumably.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
i
have
a
confirmation
order
and
injunction.
it
defines
"policy
claims"
in
both
as
a
lawsuit
relating
to
any
or
all
of
the
insurance
policies.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
your
other
piece
of
paper
says
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
go
on.
don't
worry.
i'll
look
it
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
you
want
to
say
about
the
practical
thing
i
have
in
the
back
of
my
mind
which
may
be
false?
that
language
permits
your
position,
but
it
certainly
has
rarely
been
implemented,
if
ever.
and
i
see
that,
but
in
the
back
of
my
mind
is
the
fact
that
if
we
start
mucking
around
and
give
narrow
meanings
to
these
things
now,
there
are
going
to
be
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
who
won't
get
compensated
who
have
asbestos--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
true?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
to
back
that
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
said
that?
[laughter]
