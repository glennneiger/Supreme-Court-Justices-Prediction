mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy
wipes
away
a
debtor's
liability
for
its
prepetition
conduct.
yet
travelers'
interpretation
of
the
1986
orders
gives
travelers
broader
protection
than
even
manville
could
obtain
because
it
gives
travelers
immunity
for
its
knowledge.
bankruptcy
discharges
do
not
erase
a
debtor's
knowledge.
if
manville
started
making
asbestos
products
again
after
its
discharge,
it
would
not
be
immune
for
claims
that
it
acted
with
the
knowledge
that
asbestos
is
dangerous.
yet,
that
is
precisely
the
protection
that
travelers
argues
that
it
is
entitled
to
here.
and
to
take,
for
example,
the
wise
complaint
--
which
the
travelers,
petitioners,
put
forth
as
a
typical
claim
here
--
and
you
look
at
the
class
they
purport
to
represent,
they
purport
to
represent
a
class
of
disappointed
claimants
against
three
companies,
combustion
engineering,
ac&s,
and
a&i,
none
of
which
are
manville.
they
claim
that
they
are
not
seeking
even
to
recover
for
asbestos
bodily
injury
claims.
instead,
they
claim
that
they
settled
their
claims
too
cheaply
with
combustion
engineering
because,
for
example,
in
the
1990s
allegedly,
decades,
15
years
after
the
confirmation
and
discharge
of
manville,
travelers
in
defending
combustion
engineering,
with
the
knowledge
that
asbestos
is
dangerous
or
whatever
from
working
with
manville,
provided
false
interrogatory
responses
on
behalf
of
combustion
engineering.
that
is
how
far
afield
the
proffered
interpretation
of
the
1986
order
goes.
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
are
they
claims--
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
--i
don't
think
it's
related
to
what
they
did.
i
think
the
distinction
here
is
relating
to
what
they
know.
the
point
is--
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
--if
an
asbestos
claimant,
an
independent
action
plaintiff,
is
seeking
to
recover
from
travelers
for
manville-derived
liability,
it's
barred.
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
remand
by
the
second
circuit
having
provided
the
appropriate
measuring
stick
to
the
bankruptcy
court
to
go
look
at
these
complaints
and
figure
out
whether
or
not
in
fact
somebody's
trying
to
take
money
out
of
travelers'
pocket
for
manville's
liabilities.
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
the
statutory
--
not
exactly.
the
statutory
direct
actions,
which
account
for
400
million
of
the
half
billion
dollars
they'd
like
to
pay
to
these
alleged
contemnors,
all
have
to
do
with
claimshandling
practices
of
travelers
with
respect
to
other
insureds
besides
manville.
the
common
law
independent
actions
allege
that
the
insurance
industry
as
a
whole
learned
of
the
dangers
of
asbestos.
it
has
a
free-standing
duty
to
the
world
to
warn
the
world
of
the
dangers
of
asbestos.
chubb
indemnity
insurance
company
was
not
a
manville
insurer,
yet
chubb
is
alleged
to
have
been
in
cahoots
with
the
rest
of
the
industry
in
failing
to
warn
the
world,
and,
therefore,
they
along
with
the
rest
of
the
insurance
industry
face
unlimited
liability
unrelated
to
insurance
policies
for
this--
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
--i
think
not.
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
i
think
that
every
asbestos
claimant
by
and
large
has
a
claim
against
manville,
but
that
doesn't
mean
they
are
not--
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
--the
ubiquity
of
manville
asbestos
and
their
activities
makes
practically
everybody,
if
not
everybody,
a
manville
claimant,
at
least--
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
--well,
is
or
can.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
attempting
to
assert
liability
against
an
insurance
company
because
of
manville's
own
conduct.
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
so,
getting
back
to
the
next
point
i'd
like
to
make
is,
as
mr.
issacharoff
has
stated,
the
second
circuit
was
presented
and
the
bankruptcy
court
was
presented
in
1986
with
a
plan
and
with
an
order
that
was
stated
to
be
premised
upon
the
derivative
liability
of
travelers
for
manville.
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
well,
the
insurance
settlement
order,
which
is
what
is
at
issue
here
--
which
is
not
the
channeling
injunction
order,
by
the
way;
it
was
entered
before
that
--
was
premised
upon
the
policies
being
property
of
the
estate.
that
was--
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
--the
confirmation
order
is
actually
not
directly
at
issue.
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
the
confirmation
order
is
purposely--
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
--the--
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
--definition
of
--
yes--
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
--no.
the
definition
of--
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
--of
"policy
claims"
is
contained
in
the--
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
--well,
the
definition
of
18,
1986.
it
was
a
free-standing
order
that
was
entered--
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
--there
are
two
injunctions,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
that
is
the
injunction
in
the
insurance
injunction.
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
the
other
piece
of
paper
is
even
clearer.
that's
why
they
don't
rely
on
it.
it
says,
you
may
not
seek
to
recover
asbestos
health
obligations,
which
are
the
future
manville-derived
asbestos
claims,
from
travelers,
from
a
settling
insurance
company.
they
don't
even
try
to
argue
that
the
channeling
injunction
gets
them
there.
they're
arguing
that
the
insurance
policy
buy-back
order,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
the
insurance
settlement
order
pursuant
to
which
they
retired
their
insurance
obligations
was
--
the
definition
of
"policy
claims"
was--
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
--thank
you.
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
chubb,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
fact
has
an
alternative
argument
that
was
never
reached
that,
as
a
non-manville
insurer,
it
was
in
a
position
of
an
unrepresented
future
claimant,
and
in
fact
it
cannot
be
constitutionally
bound
by
res
judicata
to
the
1986
order.
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
future
tort
claimants,
not
future
insurance
defendants.
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
cause
of
action
claimants.
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
well,
if
you
look
at
the
order
that
--
that
appoints
the
future
claims
representative,
it
is
to
represent
the
interests
of
people
who
have
been
exposed
to
manville
asbestos
but
have
not
yet
been
--
manifested
harm
because
of
the
long
latency
period
of
asbestos
injuries.
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
it's
not
a
description
of
chubb,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
the
claimants
presumably
were
people
that
were
--
the
individual
independent
action
plaintiffs
presumably
were
represented
by
the
future
claimants'
representative
in
1986
and
were
at
that
time
future
claimants
or
else
their
--
you
know,
their
harm
would
have
arisen
well
before
and
they
wouldn't
be
in
these
cases
in
this
decade.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor--
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
--may
i
respond?
mr.
jacob
c.
cohn
there
were
no
independent
actions
of
the
flavor
that
you
are
seeing
here.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
claim
like
that.
there
were
claims
by
other
manville
co-insureds.
there
were
claims
by
manville,
and
there
may
have
been
some
direct
actions.
i'm
just
simply
not
familiar
--
we
didn't
come
into
this
case
until
2004,
when
our
rights
were
impugned.
so
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
whether
or
not
there
was
anything
just
like
this,
but
i
doubt
it.
