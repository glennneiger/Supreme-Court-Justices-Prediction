justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
an
obvious
question,
i
guess.
i'd
just
like
to
hear
your
answer
directly.
case
1,
count
1,
selling
drugs;
count
2,
using
the
telephone
to
sell
the
drugs.
all
right?
the
jury
acquits
of
the
first,
convicts
of
the
second.
logically
impossible,
but
permitted
under
the
law,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
case
2--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
absolutely
illogical.
case
2,
there
is
no
count
1.
case
2,
telephone
count,
hung
jury.
we
retry
it.
permitted,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
that
happened
was
that
they
hung.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
okay.
case
2,
hung
jury,
telephone
count.
we
retry
it.
all
right.
so
now,
why
is
it,
when
we
put
them
together
and
--
case
3,
count
1,
substantive
drugs,
acquitted;
count
2,
telephone,
hung
jury.
well,
in
case
2,
we
could
get
a
retrial
of
the
telephone
count.
why
can't
we
get
a
retrial
of
the
telephone
count
now?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
that
happened
is
they
are
retrying
it
just
as
they
did
in
case
2.
why
does
the
presence
of
count
1
there
mean
that
they
can't
retry
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
i'm
going
too
fast
because
you
didn't
take
the
cases
in.
do
you
want
me
to
repeat
them?
maybe
it's
too
complicated.
i'm
just
saying
case
1,
count
1,
the
substantive
count,
conviction.
on
count
2,
telephone
count,
acquittal.
everybody
agrees
that's
permissible.
case
2
is
only
the
telephone.
that's
all
they
indicted
him
for.
and
if
they
have
a
hung
jury,
you
can,
can't
you,
retry
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
now,
when
we
have
case
3,
which
is
the
same
as
case
1
except
that,
instead
of
convicting
him,
they
had
a
hung
jury,
why
can't
you
retry
him,
just
as
you
could
in
case
2?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
everybody
agrees
it
resolves
nothing,
and
that's
why
you
could
retry
him
in
--
that's
why
you
could
retry
him
in
case
2,
because
it
resolves
nothing.
so
if
you
could
retry
him
in
case
2,
why
can't
you
retry
him
in
case
3?
what
does
the
presence
of
this
other
substantive
count
have
to
do
with
it?
since
it
never
would
have
blocked
the
conviction
on
count
2,
why
does
it
stop
you
from
retrying
count
2?
it
would
never
have
blocked
the
conviction
of
count
2.
why
does
it
stop
you
from
retrying
it?
do
you
see
--
do
you
see
my--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
the
logical
point
i
thought
the
other
side
was
making,
and
maybe
they're
not
because
it
seems
to
be
striking
you
as
surprising
or
maybe
i'm
not
making
it
in
a
clear
way.
but
what
i
wanted
was
a
clear
answer
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
why
not?
because
the
answer
to
my
question
was
exactly
what
justice
stevens
said.
why
is
it
that
--
that
if
you
could
have
inconsistent
verdicts
in
powell,
well,
then,
why
can't,
since
they
hung,
couldn't
you
try
him
again
on
the
hung
count?
and
the
answer
is,
because
you're
trying
him
again.
and
that's
why
we
have
all
the
briefs
that
we
have,
because
the
only
way
to
answer
this
is
and
look
and
see
if
the
policies
that
underlie
the
collateral
estoppel
part
of
double
jeopardy
apply
here.
and
i
can't
think
of
one
that
doesn't.
i
can't
think
of
one
single
one
that
wouldn't
apply.
maybe
there
are
some.
and
i
can't
think
of
any
reason
for
allowing
the
government
to
have
a
second
bite
at
this
apple.
what
is
the
reason?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
they
don't.
suppose
that
they
never
brought
up
that
hung
count.
then
you
wouldn't
even
have
the
first
bite
at
the
apple.
so
you
would
think
it
would
be
a
fortiori
you
could
go
ahead.
but
that's
the
case;
you
clearly
can't
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
think
it
had
anything
to
do
with
integrity
of
anything.
i
thought
what
it
had
to
do
with
is
that
they
are
being
tried
at
the
same
time.
and
to
test
that
out
in
my
mind,
i
imagine
this:
in
february,
we
try
the
individual
for
the
drug
count;
he's
acquitted.
in
june,
we
bring
a
telephone
count.
absolutely
forbidden,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
why
should
the
government
be
one
whit
better
off
because,
in
addition
to
doing
that,
they
happened
to
bring
a
telephone
count
in
january
along
with
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
start
the
other
side,
which
i
think
justice
stevens
was
suggesting.
assume
that
there
was
only
one
trial
on
the
substantive
count
in
january.
now
you
decide
--
he's
acquitted.
now
you
decide
to
indict
him
in
july
on
the
telephone
count.
you
argue
to
the
judge:
judge,
there
shouldn't
be
double
jeopardy
here
because
maybe
the
jury
just
acquitted
him
the
first
time
because
they
were
lenient.
maybe
they
liked
his
looks.
maybe
they
were
distracted
by
a
fly.
maybe
they
were,
maybe
they
were
--
and
we
didn't
even
get
an
appeal.
are
you
going
to
win
that
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
not
even
a
close.
okay.
not
even
close.
now,
since
you're
going
to
lose
that
case,
i
grant
you
there's
thousands
of
cases
talking
about
your
ability
to
bring
more
cases
if
you
have
a
hung
jury.
i
concede
all
those.
none
of
them
talks
about
double
jeopardy,
to
my
knowledge.
so
we're
back
to
the
hypothetical.
you've
lost
your
case.
now,
all
that
you
did
to
turn
that
case
into
a
winning
case
was
you
also
indicted
him
on
the
telephone
count
in
january.
now,
that
was
my
question
the
first
time,
and
you
began
to
have
two
answers.
i
just
didn't
see
why
the
government
should
be
any
better
off
because
they
also
indicted
him
in
january.
given
the
language
"double
jeopardy",
you
might
think
the
government,
if
anything,
should
be
worse
off,
but
let's
keep
them
neutral.
so
what
is
the
reason
that
the
government
should
be
worse
off
because
they
indicted
him
in
january
on
the
telephone
count
as
well
as
in
june?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no
--
better.
i
misspoke.
