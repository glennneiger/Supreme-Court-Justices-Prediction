chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
today
in
yeager
v.
united
states.
mr.
buffone.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
powell
extends
to
subsequent
prosecutions
--
i
know
you
argue
that
it
doesn't
--
but
if
it
does,
isn't
it
unusual
that
the
defendant
is
in
better
shape
if
a
jury
hangs
on
the
non-acquitted
count
than
if
he
is
convicted
on
the
nonacquitted
count?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
--
you
are
asking
us
for
a
pretty
dramatic
extension
of
powell.
powell
was
not
a
case
involving
subsequent
prosecutions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
because
in
the
same
proceeding
you
have
two
different
jury
verdicts,
one
going
the
other
way
and
one
--
obviously,
one
way
and
one
the
other
way.
so
to
protect
the
jury's
conclusions,
you
couldn't
give
effect
to
one
without
undermining
the
other.
it's
a
very
different
case
here.
the
only
jury
determination
you
have
is
the
acquittal.
if
you
give
effect
--
if
you
don't
give
effect
to
the
findings
in
the
acquittal,
you
are
undermining
the
jury,
the
only
determination
by
the
jury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
--
the
point
about
the
big
extension,
you
were
rather
coy
in
your
brief
about
what
you
think
about
ashe
v.
swenson.
are
you
asking
us
to
revisit
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you're
not
going
to
talk
about
--
you're
not
going
to
talk
about
the
text
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
are
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
we
rely
on
that
the
case
is
pretty
easy,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
person
was
in
jeopardy
on
the
hung
offense
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
this
court's
decisions,
but
not
under
the
text
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that's
right,
and
your
argument
depends
upon
that
interest
balancing
against
the
interest
in
giving
effect
to
the
acquittal
verdict.
now,
what
if
i
think,
under
the
seventh
amendment,
that's
--
that
what
is
important
is
protecting
jury
verdicts?
and
the
interest
in
the
irrational
case,
when
you
have
a
conviction
and
acquittal,
is
that
you
have
two
jury
verdicts
and
you
can't
go
one
way
or
the
other
without
undermining
one
of
them.
here,
however,
you
can
give
full
effect
to
the
verdict
of
acquittal
without
undermining
another
jury
verdict.
you
certainly
undermine
the
government's
interest
in
prosecuting
after
a
hung
jury,
but
if
i
think
what's
important
under
the
seventh
amendment
is
the
jury
verdicts,
then
the
case
comes
out
the
other
way,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
he
--
he
carried
that
burden
before
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
revisiting
of
that
issue
was
not
included
within
the
question
presented.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
we
--
if
we
agree
with
you
on
that
proposition,
then
the
conflict
that
we
granted
cert
to
resolve
would
still
continue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
--
your
theory
depends
upon
viewing
a
hung
jury
as
constituting
some
action
by
the
jury.
now,
obviously
it
does
in
some
sense.
but
if
you
view
--
if
you
accept
the
proposition
that
juries
only
act
by
returning
verdicts,
and
that's
the
reason
you
can
retry,
because
with
a
hung
jury,
the
jury
hasn't
really
done
anything
in
the
way
jurors
act,
then
the
case
comes
out
--
then
the
defendant
prevails,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
buffone,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-67,
yeager
versus
united
states.
