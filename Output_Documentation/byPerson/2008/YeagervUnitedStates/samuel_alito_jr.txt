that's
the
government's
--
that's
the
government's
argument.
and
in
order
to
convict
for
securities
fraud
based
on
an
omission,
isn't
it
necessary
for
there
to
be
a
duty
to
disclose?
and
what
would
prevent
--
how
can
we
be
sure
that
the
jury
here
did
not
find
that
there
was
no
securities
fraud
because,
insofar
as
the
government
was
proceeding
on
an
omissions
theory,
your
client
didn't
have
a
duty
to
disclose,
did
not
cause
a
material
fact
to
be
omitted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
agree
with
that,
but
why
couldn't
they
find
that
there
was
no
securities
fraud
based
on
an
omissions
theory
because
there
wasn't
any
duty
on
mr.
yeager's
part
to
disclose?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
this
about
the
finality
of
jury
verdicts?
is
--
does
the
constitution
require
either
federal
or
state
law
to
permit
the
--
a
partial
verdict?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
every
state?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
the
constitution
doesn't
require
that,
then
why
does
the
constitution,
in
your
view,
require
that
issue
preclusion
occur
when
the
jury
acquits
on
certain
counts
but
hangs
on
other
counts?
if
--
if
a
partial
verdict
were
not
required,
and
if
the
jury
came
back
and
said,
we
--
we've
reached
a
verdict
on
some
counts
but
not
all
counts,
the
remedy
would
be
a
mistrial
on
all
counts
and
a
retrial
on
all
counts.
why
--
why
is
it
--
does
the
constitution
require
a
different
result
if
federal
law
or
state
law
chooses
to
allow
the
return
of
a
partial
verdict?
