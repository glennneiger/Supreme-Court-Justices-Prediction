well,
why
not?
it
is
a
successive
prosecution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
in
the
sense
of
an
indictment
that
took
place
after
the
other
acquittal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
there
a
difference
in
the
fact
that
in
the
first
case
where
there's
--
where
there
was
a
conflicting
simultaneous
verdict,
one
can
explain
the
acquittal
on
grounds
of
leniency
or
compromise
or
something
like
that,
that
says
that,
therefore,
we
will
give
effect
to
the
--
the
conviction
when
they're
simultaneous
because
of
the
reasons
why
there
may
be
irrationality
in
the
conflict.
but
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
the
--
the
validity
of
the
acquittal
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
had
time.
and
when
you
have
150
counts,
it's
entirely
possible
they
just
didn't
reach
a
decision
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
have
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
conflict
between
a
guilty
and
an
innocent
verdict,
there
isn't
--
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
the
integrity
of
the
acquittal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
reason
for
that
is
there
are
doubts
about
the
integrity
of
the
acquittal.
they
probably
compromised,
just
to
say
not
to
be
too
tough
on--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
here
you
have
sequential
prosecutions,
and
there's
no
reason
to
question
the
integrity
of
the
acquittal
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
key
to
your
argument
is
the
government
is
entitled
to
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
try
its
case.
it
had
that
opportunity
the
first
time
around.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
were
no
separate
counts,
that
would
have
been
--
that
would
have
been
a
fair
--
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
has
--
but
it
has
the
right
to
retry
in
the
same
position
as
it
would
have
been
if
it
had
not
brought
the
first
proceeding.
and
if
it
had
not
brought
the
first
proceeding
in
this
case,
it
would
have
been
barred.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
because
we
have
the
dunn
doctrine,
which
itself
is
questionable.
it
basically
says
there
is
a
certain
situation
in
which
we
will
tolerate
what
may
be
an
irrational
verdict,
and
the
reason
we
tolerate
it
is
that
the
acquittal
itself
may
be
explained
on
other
grounds.
namely--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
whole
--
whole
doctrine
of
inconsistent
verdicts
depends
on
the
assumption
that
what
appears
to
be
an
irrational
inconsistency
may
have
another
explanation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
one
hung
jury
followed
by
a
second
when
there
has
been
an
acquittal
the
first
time
around
is
not
customary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
difference
is
in
the
--
in
the
first
trial,
you're
not
impugning
the
integrity
of
the
jury's
verdict.
you're
following
the
acquittal,
and
that's
true
in
the
compromise
cases,
the
dunn
case
and
those
cases,
but
that's
not
the
case
here
because
you're
talking
about
two
different
juries.
you're
saying
the
second
jury
should
have
an
--
an
opportunity
to
correct
what
the
first
jury
did,
even
though
it
would
not
have
that
opportunity
if
the
first
jury
had
not
faced
the
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
should
have,
but
it
didn't.
we
know
that.
and
we
just
know
they
did
not
reach
a
conclusion
on
this
issue,
but
they
did
reach
a
conclusion
on
the
count
on
which
they
acquitted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
make
the
same
presumption
when
there's
an
inconsistent
verdict,
but
you
say
even
if
it's
irrational
we'll
go
along
with
it
because
of
the
one
jury,
and
they
may
have
had
non
--
unsound
legal
reasons
for
saying,
well,
we'll
let
the
guy
off
on
the
one
count.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
jury
did
not
take
irrational
action
in
this
case.
the
only
action
--
that's
relevant
was
the
acquittal.
the
other
they
didn't
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
irrational
if
they
had
returned
a
verdict,
but
they
said
we
can't
agree
--
for
who
knows
why.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
all
that
clear,
because,
as
you
argue,
the
court
--
the
district
court
was
correct
in
analyzing
the
--
the
estoppel
issue.
and
it's
obviously
a
very
difficult
issue
because
judges
have
disagreed
about
it
and
the
government
and
your
opponent
disagree
on
it.
so,
it's
entirely
possible
that
the
jury
just
wasn't
able
to
figure
it
all
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
jury
could
not
have
been
as
confused
as
the
court
of
appeals
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioner,
a
former
executive
of
a
subsidiary
of
enron
corporation
was
charged
in
a
federal
indictment
with
securities
and
wire
fraud
and
with
insider
trading
and
money
laundering.
the
indictment
alleged
that
petitioner
misled
the
public
about
the
virtues
of
a
fiber-optic
communications
system
being
developed
by
his
former
employer
and
that
he
then
enriched
himself
by
trading
enron's
stock
without
divulging
the
truth
about
the
system.
after
a
13-week
jury
trial,
the
jury
acquitted
petitioner
on
the
fraud
charges
but
failed
to
reach
a
verdict
on
the
insider-trading
and
money-laundering
counts.
the
government
later
reindicted
petitioner
for
the
counts
in
which
the
jury
had
hung.
petitioner
moved
to
dismiss
the
new
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
issue-preclusion
component
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
barred
retrial
on
those
charges.
specifically,
he
asserted
that
the
jury's
verdict
of
acquittal
at
the
first
trial
had
necessarily
determined
that
he
did
not
possess
insider
information
and
that
a
second
trial
for
insider-trading
and
money-laundering
would
turn
on
that
issue.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
and
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
the
fifth
circuit
concluded
that
to
decipher
what
the
--
the
issues
the
jury
had
decided
in
its
verdict,
it
could
consider
the
jury's
failure
to
reach
a
verdict
on
other
counts.
using
that
approach,
the
court
explained
that
if
the
jury
had
in
fact
included
that
petitioner
did
not
possess
insider
information,
it
would
have
acquitted
him
of
the
insider-trading
and
money-laundering.
the
fact
that
the
jury
instead
hung
on
those
counts,
the
court
explained
made
it
impossible
to
decide
what
the
jury
had
necessarily
decided
in
its
acquittals.
accordingly,
the
court
allowed
the
government
to
prosecute
petitioner
again.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse
and
remand.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
consideration
of
hung
counts
has
no
place
in
the
issue-preclusion
analysis.
to
identify
what
a
jury
necessarily
determined
at
trial,
the
court
should
scrutinize
the
jury's
decisions,
not
its
failures
to
decide.
a
contrary
conclusion
would
require
improper
speculation
into
what
transpired
in
the
jury
room.
thus,
if
the
possession
of
insider
information
was
a
critical
issue
of
ultimate
fact
in
all
of
the
charges
against
petitioner,
a
jury
verdict
that
necessarily
decided
that
issue
in
petitioner's
favor
protects
him
from
prosecution
for
any
charge
for
which
that
is
an
essential
element.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
and
alito
have
joined.
and
justice
alito
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia
and
thomas
have
joined.
