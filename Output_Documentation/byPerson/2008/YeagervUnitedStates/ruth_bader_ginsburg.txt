but
ashe
is
quite
a
different
case.
ashe
is
a
seriatim
prosecution.
it
was
one
event,
a
robbery.
there
were
six
victims.
victim
number
one
--
the
charge
relating
to
victim
number
one,
was
an
acquittal
that
necessarily
decided
that
the
defendant
was
not
among
the
robbers.
so
that
is
quite
a
different
situation
from
what
we
have
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
--
you're
not
contending
that
double
jeopardy
itself
was
at
issue?
in
other
words,
claim
preclusion.
there
would
be
no
claim
preclusion,
so
we're
talking
only
about
issue
preclusion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
means
it
was
necessarily
--
the
issue
was
necessarily
decided?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
hung
counts
are
equivalent
--
equivalent
to
an
acquittal
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not,
when
considering
what
the
government
did
on
its
second
chance?
it
trimmed
5
--
if
there
were
20
insider
trading,
on
the
new
indictment,
there
were
5.
there
were
99
counts
of
laundering,
which
were
trimmed
to
8,
something
within
the
jury's
ken.
but
isn't
the
most
likely
thing
in
this
case
that
the
jury
was
simply
exhausted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
qualify
it
in
your
statement
of
the
facts.
is
there
any
insider
information
with
relation
to
the
insider
information
charges
that
is
different
in
any
respect
from
the
insider
information
in
connection
with
the
substantive
charge?
