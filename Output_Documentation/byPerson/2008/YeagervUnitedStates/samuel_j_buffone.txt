mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
jury's
acquittal
resolves
an
issue
in
a
defendant's
favor,
that
determination
is
final
and
the
government
may
not
seek
an
inconsistent
determination
of
that
issue
from
a
second
jury.
unlike
acquittals,
hung
counts
are
not
verdicts.
they
decide
nothing,
and
therefore
a
hung
count
cannot
be
inconsistent
with
an
acquittal.
a
straightforward
application
of
this
court's
decision
in
ashe
v.
swenson
is
all
that
is
called
for
in
this
case.
a
new
rule
is
not
necessary.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons.
first,
under
the
ashe
test
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
dowling,
the
record
as
a
whole
must
be
analyzed.
and
in
dowling,
the
court
looked
at
admissions
made
by
the
defendant's
attorney
during
the
course
of
the
second
proceeding
that
identification
of
his
client
was
not
an
issue.
similarly
here,
looking
at
the
entirety
of
the
record,
in
its
arguments
closing
and
opening,
and
most
importantly
in
its
cross-examination
of
mr.
yeager,
the
government
made
clear
to
the
jury
its
theory
of
omissions.
and
that
theory
of
omission
was
that
mr.
yeager
when
he
was
at
the
2000
analysts
conference
had
a
duty
to
stand
up
and
correct
omissions
if
there
were
any
misstatements
made
by
others.
they
argued
to
the
jury
that
he
would
be
guilty
of
omissions
if
he
did
not
affirmatively
correct
it.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
well,
your
honor,
first
there
was
more
to
the
trial
record
than
a
snippet
of
cross-examination.
again,
in
opening
statement
the
government
began
by
arguing
to
the
jury
that
mr.
yeager
was
the
man
behind
the
screen,
that
he
was--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--your
honor,
first,
the
instructions
permitted
alternative
ways
to
reach
the
first
element
of
securities
fraud,
and
one
of
the
three
alternatives
was
either
misstatements
or
omissions.
and
i
think
the
instruction,
for
all
of
its
frailty,
was
clear
that
the
jury
could
convict
on
an
omissions
theory.
now,
your
honor's
question--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--your
honor,
the
indictment
was
an
integrated
theory
of
fraud,
that
had
charged
that
mr.
yeager
and
others
had
planned
to
make
misrepresentations
and
material
omissions
for
one
purpose,
and
that
purpose
was
to
enhance
the
price
of
enron
stock
so
that
they
could
later
engage
in
insider
trading
to
sell
that
stock.
the
omissions
theory
was
grounded
in
the
indictment.
it
was
elucidated
by
the
instructions,
and
it
was
clarified
so
that
there
could
be
no
uncertainty
by
the
cross-examination
and
arguments
of
counsel.
this
jury
--
under
an
ashe
analysis,
the
question
is
what
did
this
jury
believe
and
what
did
they
rationally
decide?
they--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--justice
ginsburg,
first,
it
is
my
belief
that
seriatim
prosecutions
raise
no
greater
threat
to
the
core
values
of
double
jeopardy
than
was
raised
here.
those
core
values
are,
first
of
all,
the
finality
of
acquittals.
and
the
acquittal
here
was
offended
by
any
effort
to
retry
an
issue
of
fact
necessarily
decided.
this--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--yes,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
do
not
argue
claim
preclusion
here.
our
argue
is
issue
preclusion
or
previously
known
as
collateral
estoppel
before
clarification
by
this
court.
your
honor,
to
the
question
of
seriatim
prosecution,
again,
although
ashe
was
in
a
sense
a
seriatim
prosecution,
in
all
of
the
ashe-type
cases
decided
by
this
court
jeopardy
had
not
even
attached,
let
alone
terminated.
the
issue
we
believe
should
be
addressed
in
terms
of
what
was
the
finality
of
the
judgment.
the
finality
of
the
judgment
here
were
six
acquittals.
those
acquittals
were
final
and
were
not
subject
to
redetermination.
the
issue
preclusive
effect
arises
from
the
jury's
acquittals,
not
from
the
hung
counts,
the
hung
counts
which
were
not
final
and
which
resolved
nothing.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
no,
your
honor,
i
think
precisely
the
opposite.
hung
counts
have
none
of
the
force
of
an
acquittal.
they
have
none
of
what
this
court
has
historically
recognized
as
the
powerful
way
that
a
jury
speaks
when
it
acquits
in
cases
such
as
martin
linen,
where
the
court
recognized
that.
the
hung
counts
historically,
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
were
not
even
accepted
at
common
law
as
an
option
for
a
jury.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
justice
scalia,
first,
we
believe
that
the
--
i
believe
that
the
ashe
test
relates
to
the
total
circumstances
on
the
record.
what
is
it
from
the
record
that
the
court
can
derive
meaning
from?
the
court
can
derive
meaning
from
all
that
was
presented
to
the
jury,
and
from
all
that
the
jury
decided.
in
its
hung
counts,
the
jury
did
not
speak
with
the
unanimity
and
the
finality
that
it
did
in
its
acquittals.
as
this
court,
speaking
through
--
in
both
the
majority
and
the
concurring
opinions
--
dissenting
opinions
in
sattazahn,
recognized,
hung
counts
speak
nothing.
hung
counts--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--justice
kennedy,
i
agree
that
the
hung
counts
are
meaningless
and
that
is
my
point,
but
i
believe
that
it
does
further
our
analysis
and
the
proper
analysis
that
this
court
should
engage
in.
and
that
is,
do
the
acquittals
have
finality,
and
is
there
anything
inconsistent
with
the
jury's
inability
to
reach
a
determination
with
the
finality
of
its
acquittals?
the
jury
did
not
speak
unanimously
in
its
acquittals.
there
is
no
record
way
to
determine
why
they
failed
to
reach
a
determination,
and
they
are
therefore
not
inconsistent
with
the
final
determination
of
acquittal.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
your
honor,
we
simply
don't
know
that.
the
jury
may
have
failed
to
reach
a
verdict
for
any
number
of
reasons.
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
it's
quite
possible
that
the
reason
that
the
jury
failed
to
reach
a
verdict
was
that
it
had
176
counts
before
it;
that
the
jury,
as
set
out
in
our
reply
brief,
had
made
known
to
the
district
court
that
it
was
under
severe
financial
stress.
the
jurors
wanted
the
trial
to
be
over
so
that
they
could
get
back
to
their
full-time
employment,
and
one
of
the
jurors
actually
asked
to
be
removed
from
the
jury
because
of
that
financial
distress.
in
the
face
of
that,
the
court
gave
a
very
unusual
allen
charge;
that
after
the
jury
had
sent
out
a
note
saying
that
they
were
deadlocked,
the
court
issued
an
allen
charge
and
70
minutes
later
discharged
the
jury.
it
--
the
--
the
point,
your
honor,
is
that
we
will
never
know
why
this
jury--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--your
honor,
we
know
that
they
acquitted.
that
is
a
certainty.
we
have
finality
to
those
acquittals.
they
were
unanimous
and
are
not
subject
to
question
again.
they
cannot
be
subject
to
appeal,
and
they
cannot
be
subject
to
overturning,
even
if
they
are
egregiously
erroneous.
when
we
lay
next
to
that
the
hung
counts
and
the
way
that
hung
counts
have
historically
been
looked
at,
first
not
tolerated
by
courts:
coercive
means
applied
depriving
jurors
of
food
and
drink
and
heat
in
cold
climates
until
they
reached
a
verdict;
contemporary
law
where
we
permit
allen
charges
in
a
quest
for
unanimity
to,
wherever
possible,
have
a
jury
speak
its
will.
we
cannot
equate,
in
the
light
of
that
history
and
the
firm
precedent
of
this
court,
an
inability
to
reach
a
decision
with
the
finality
and
persuasion
of
an
acquittal.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
well,
your
honor,
that's
a
--
a
two-edged
sword,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
defendant
is
on
the
opposite
horns
of
that
dilemma.
if
the
counts
are
not
joined,
then
the
effect
of
the
acquittal
would
be
to
bar
them
by
res
judicata.
so,
by
joinder,
he's
on
the
other
side
of
that
fence.
it's,
as
this
court
recognized,
whose
ox
is
being
gored
in
powell
by
either
the
acquittals
or
the
convictions.
well,
this
is
a
case
of
whose
ox
is
being
gored
by
the
joinder,
and
it
should
not
be
dispositive.
collateral
estoppel
effect
should
apply
to
counts
within
an
indictment,
just
as
res
judicata
would
apply
if
they
were
separated.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
i
agree,
your
honor.
under
powell--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--there's
no
question.
we
have
conflicting
verdicts--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--and
we
are
not
going
to
try
to
determine
what
the--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--now,
your
honor,
that
would
depend
on
what
happened
at
the
trial.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
well,
if
they
hung,
your
honor,
yes,
it
would
be
permitted.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
your
honor,
it
would
depend.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
your
honor,
the
presence
of
count
1
in
your
hypothetical
is
not
dispositive.
an
acquittal
on
count
1
says--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
because
a
hung
jury
resolves
nothing,
your
honor.
it
doesn't--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
your
honor,
i
believe
the
--
the
clear
answer
is
that
for
collateral
estoppel
to
attach,
there
must
be
a
necessary
determination
of
a
factual
issue,
and
the
necessary
determination
of
that
factual
issue
can
occur
in
your
count
1
through
an
acquittal
or
a
conviction.
it
cannot
occur
through
a
hung
count
because
there
is
nothing
to
be
resolved.
there
is
nothing
that
would
be
necessarily
decided.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
is
a
clear
choice,
and
the
rationale
for
the
clarity
of
that
choice
is
that
acquittals
have
long
been
recognized
as
being
important
for
finality
purposes
for
double
jeopardy
law.
so,
for
example--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--yes,
your
honor.
the
--
the
perez
line
that
tells
us
that
when
there
is
manifest
necessity
arising
from
a
jury
not
reaching
a
verdict,
that
retrial
is
appropriate
following
a
hung
count.
that
line
of
cases
stands
in
--
as
i
believe
it's
the
basis
of
your
honor's
question,
stands
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
line
of
cases
that
require
that
jury
acquittals
be
given
final
effect,
cases
like
foo
fong
--
fong
foo,
excuse
me.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
all
right,
so
what--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--your
honor,
i
think
we
should
go
--
the
court
should
go
to
the
history
of
its
double
jeopardy
jurisprudence,
and
that
makes
clear
that
the
core
concepts
underlying
the
double
jeopardy
clause
are,
first,
finality
of
jury
verdicts,
and,
second,
to
avoid
all
of
the
constitutional
perils
of
successive
trials,
because
successive
trials--
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
--your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
--
i
am
not
aware
of
a
constitutional
underpinning
for
that,
but
certainly
the
practices
in
the
courts
are
to
permit
partial
verdicts.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
be
a
different
result
because
i
think
in
--
in
most
jurisdictions,
as
i
understand
it,
the
reaction
to
that
kind
of
a
split
verdict
would
be
to
try
to
get
the
jury
to
reach
a
full
and
final
verdict,
to
give
some
form
of
an
allen
charge
to
encourage
additional
deliberations,
to
seek
unanimity
in
the
jury's
verdict.
where
we
don't
have
that
unanimity,
the
court
is
forced
for
collateral
estoppel,
for
issue
preclusion
purposes,
to
justice
ginsburg's
point,
not
to
claim
preclusion
issues.
if
we
set
aside
claim
preclusion,
the
perez
line
of
cases
tells
us
to
do
what
we
do
with
claim
preclusion.
for
issue
preclusion,
the
question
is,
is
there
some
finality
to
what
the
jury
did,
in
your
hypothetical
its
partial
verdict,
that
speaks
to
the
counts
that
it
was
not
able
to
resolve?
and
if
it
speaks
that,
after
the
ashe
analysis,
that
there
was
an
issue
necessarily
decided,
then
there
is
a
bar
under
the
doctrine
of
issue
preclusion
to
the
re-litigation
of
that
question.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
samuel
j.
buffone
the
solicitor
general
has
essentially
asked
this
court
to
take
a
metaphysical
view
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
but
the
teachings
of
this
court
from
sealfon
through
ashe
is
that
the
important
protections
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
applied
to
issue
preclusion
must
be
approached
with
reason,
with
rationality,
with
a
non-hypertechnical
view
in
order
to
protect
the
public
policies
that
underlie
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
that
is
quite
simply
that
what
happened
here
should
not
occur.
that
a
defendant
should
not
be
forced
to
relitigate
before
a
second
jury
an
issue
that
was
necessarily
decided.
i
sat
through
and
argued
through
a
13-and-a-half-week
jury
trial.
a
reasonable
and
rational
explanation
of
what
occurred
there
is
that
we
had
a
conscientious
jury
that
followed
its
instructions,
that
tried
to
reach
through
a
complex
176-count
indictment,
and
they
simply
were
not
able
to.
they
spoke
the
community
will,
and
they
spoke
it
forcefully
in
their
acquittals.
six
of
them.
and
the
only
conclusion
that
can
be
reached
from
those
acquittals
is
that
mr.
yeager
did
not
possess
insider
information.
at
the
beginning
of
this
trial,
we
filed
two
motions,
the
first
challenging
the
specificity
of
the
indictment,
and
the
second
seeking
a
bill
of
particulars.
the
district
court
answered
both
with
the
same
answer.
the
insider
information
that
mr.
yeager
is
charged
with
possessing
in
the
insider
trading
counts
is
the
false
statements
made
by
others
at
the
2000
analysts
conference.
the
omissions
theory
was
not,
as
the
solicitor
general
submits,
some
afterthought.
it
was
core
to
the
government's
prosecution,
and
it
was
core
to
the
case.
the
jury
decided
that
the
omissions
theory
was
not
a
basis
to
convict
on
the
six
counts
that
it
acquitted.
it
determined
that
mr.
yeager
did
not
possess
that
information.
and
mr.
yeager
is
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
those
acquittals.
thank
you.
