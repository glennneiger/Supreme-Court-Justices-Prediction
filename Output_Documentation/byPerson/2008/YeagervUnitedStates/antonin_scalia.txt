justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
said
--
we
said
in
ashe,
didn't
we,
that
you
should
take
into
account
all
the
circumstances
in
determining
what
was
decided
in
the
first
acquittal,
all
the
circumstances.
how
can
--
how
can
you
close
your
eyes
to
the
circumstance
that
is
alleged
here,
that
the
--
the
hung
jury
portion
of
the
jury's
verdict
is
simply
inconsistent
with
the
acquittal
portion,
and
therefore
you
should
not
count
the
acquittal
for
double
jeopardy
purposes?
isn't
this
part
of
the
total
circumstances?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
shows
--
it
shows
that
--
that
the
point
on
which
they
--
you
assert
they
were
unanimous
and
the
point
on
which
you
say
later
prosecution
should
be
disallowed
was
in
fact
a
point
on
which
the
jury
was
confused,
because
they
would
have
come
out
the
other
way
if
indeed
they
were
unanimous
on
the
counts
that
--
that
acquitted.
they
should
have
come
out
the
same
way
on
the
--
on
the
hung
counts.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
point
is
that
they
were
deadlocked
and
would
not
have
been
deadlocked,
assuming
we
don't
inquire
into
--
into
the
issue
that
justice
souter
raised.
they
were
deadlocked
and
would
not
have
been
deadlocked
if
indeed
they
made
the
--
the
acquittal
finding
that
you're
relying
upon
for
double
jeopardy.
