mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
separate
lines
of
double
jeopardy
analysis
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
government
can
retry
hung
counts
that
occur
in
a
verdict
simultaneously
with
acquittals.
the
first
is
the
principle
that
the
government
may,
under
the
doctrine
of
continuing
jeopardy,
try
to
obtain
a
verdict
when
a
jury
is
hung.
the
basic
principle
there
is
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
convict
and
that
the
hung
counts,
when
the
jury
cannot
agree,
interrupt
and
prevent
the
government
from
achieving
that.
double
jeopardy,
therefore,
does
not
bar
the
government
from
completing
its
opportunity
to
obtain
a
verdict.
the
second
doctrinal
line
is
that
which
grows
out
of
the
powell
case.
collateral
estoppel
is
premised
on
the
idea
that
the
jury
has
acted
rationally.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
powell
was
a
case
in
which
the
court
rejected
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
as
a
means
of
upsetting
a
mixed
verdict
of
acquittals
and
convictions,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
that
it
undermines
that
determination,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
acquittals
will
stand
as
acquittals,
and
they
will
bar
re-prosecution
on
that
offense.
to
the
extent
that
there
are
determinations
that
are
made
by
the
acquittals
that
are
independent
of
any
inconsistency
with
the
hung
counts,
that
too
can
have
collateral
estoppel
effect
in
a
successive
prosecution.
but
i
think
the
crucial
thing
here
is
that
this
is
not
properly
viewed
as
a
successive
prosecution
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
ashe
v.
swenson
and
the
cases--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
it's
not
in
the
sense,
i
think,
justice
stevens
that
the
court
used
that
in
ashe.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that
indictment
simply
embodies
non-jeopardy-barred
counts
that
were
in
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
no,
i
think
that
there
is,
justice
stevens,
if
on
the
theory
that
the
petitioner
propounds
the
verdict
on
the
acquittals
is
inconsistent
with
the
mistrial.
and
that's
the
only
way
in
which
collateral
estoppel
could
apply,
only
if
the
jury
had
necessarily
determined
a
fact
on
the
acquittals
that
should
have
led
to
acquittals
on
the
insider
trading
counts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
--
petitioner's
theory
would
be
identical
if
there
were
one
insider
trading
count.
and
i
think
that
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
court
should
not
get
too
distracted
by
the
number
of
counts,
because
all
of
the
insider
trading
counts
turned
on
a
common
core
of
fact.
they
were
all
resolved
identically--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we're
not
questioning
the
integrity
of
the
acquittal
as
far
as
it
has
direct
double
jeopardy
application.
the
question
is
whether
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
ought
to
be
applied.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
reason,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the
hung
counts
do
not
constitute
a
resolution
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
there's
a
reason
for
that,
justice
breyer,
that
is
grounded
in
double
jeopardy
policies,
and
i
think
it
goes
to
the
question
that
justice
souter
asked
as
well:
why
the
court
should
prefer
the
double
jeopardy
doctrine
that
allows
the
government
to
retry
the
hung
counts
when
they
are
all
brought
together
in
the
same
proceeding?
and
that
is
this
--
and
i
think
it's
made
most
vivid
by
imagining
ashe
v.
swenson
in
a
slightly
different
posture.
ashe
v.
swenson
involved
robberies
of
six
individuals
at
a
poker
game.
the
government
indicted
each
one
of
them
as
a
separate
robbery,
and
the
government
tried
one
of
them
first.
and
in
that
one,
the
jury's
acquittal
was
understood
to
mean
that
the
defendant
was
not
the
robber.
if
the
government
could
go
sequentially
through
and
try
the
other
five,
it
has
the
opportunity
to
try
to
wear
the
defendant
down
or
refine
its
case
or
improve
its
case
in
a
way
that
the
court
regarded
as
impermissible.
but
suppose
that
in
ashe
the
government
hadn't
done
that,
it
had
brought
all
six
robbery
prosecutions
together,
and
the
jury
returned
one
verdict
of
acquittal
on
one
robber,
and
on
the
other
five
it
hung.
in
that
situation,
i
think
--
which
is
the
situation
we
have
here--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but,
justice
stevens,
that
is
identical
to
this
case.
there
is
no
difference
to
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
but,
justice
stevens,
if
you
would
question
the
integrity
of
the
acquittal,
if
the
jury
acquits
on
one
robber
and
hangs
on
five,
that
is
this
case.
the
only
difference
in
this
case
is
it's
a
securities
fraud
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
are
two
reasons
for
that,
justice
breyer.
the
first
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
not
aimed
at
preventing
the
government
from
attempting
to
bring
its
--
all
of
its
charges
in
one
indictment
against
the
defendant.
what
the
collateral
estoppel
component
is
aimed
at
is
the
government
going
sequentially,
carving
its
prosecution
up
into
pieces,
and
trying
in
different
attempts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
my
response
to
that,
justice
souter,
is
that
double
jeopardy
has
always
consisted
of
a
balance
of
values.
there
is,
of
course,
the
interest
that
your
honor
has
identified,
but
the
countervailing
interest
is
that
the
government
should
have
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
convict
a
defendant
on
charges
that
have
been
preferred
by
a
grand
jury
on
a
showing
of
probable
cause,
and
that
does
not
occur
when
the
hung
counts
deprive
the
government
of
that
one
opportunity.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
let
me
--
let
me
give
two
answers
to
that,
justice
souter.
first
of
all,
the
position
for
which
petitioner
argues
does
not
depend
on
the
number
of
counts.
if
there
had
been
two
counts
in
the
indictment--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
would
be
the
same.
but
more
fundamentally,
i
think
that
the
number
of
counts
in
this
indictment
should
not
lead
the
court
to
think
that
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
government
overcharged
in
some
nefarious
effort.
first
of
all,
nefarious
efforts
like
that
tend
to
backfire
on
the
government,
and
that's
why
sound
prosecution
policy
dictates
against
overcharging.
here,
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
regard
the
number
of
counts
as
a
proxy
for
overcharging,
and
that
is
because
they
break
up
into
logically
distinct
units.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
so,
justice
ginsburg,
because
all
of
the
insider
trading
counts
turn
on
the
same
fact:
did
petitioner
have
inside
information
--
did
he
know
that
the
enron
broadband
system
that
he
was
integrally
involved
in,
was
the
strategic
manager
in
charge
of,
wasn't
working?
if
he
had
that
knowledge
and
he
traded,
the
number
of
counts
is
really
irrelevant.
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
jury
resolved
all
of
the
insider
trading
counts
the
same
way,
and
the
money
laundering
counts
just
had
to
do
with
the
disposition
of
the
proceeds,
they're
all
resolved
the
same
way.
the
jury
obviously
deadlocked
on
whether
some
fact
that
the
government
needed
to
prove
for
those
counts
was
established.
and
the
bizarre
thing,
i
think,
about
petitioner's
position
is
that
he
seeks
to
get
through
a
legal
doctrine,
collateral
estoppel,
which
is
a
big
extension
from
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
textually
prohibits,
exactly
what
the
jury
would
not
give
him.
the
jury--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
needs
to
revisit
ashe
v.
swenson
in
order
to
resolve
this
case,
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
ashe
v.
swenson
is
a
doctrine
that
transposed
certain
civil
policies
that
are
--
are
expressed
through
the
doctrine
of
issue
preclusion
into
the
double
jeopardy
context
in
a
way
that
was
not
supported
by
the
history
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
is
not
supported
by
the
text
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
which
requires
the
same
events.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
it
is
because
it
says
that
the
same
offense
is
what
you're
protected
against
for
double
jeopardy,
and
the
offenses
in
this
case
are
distinct
under
blockburger.
but
my
point
about--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
jeopardy
continues
until
the
government
has
the
opportunity
to
obtain
a
verdict.
so
the
fact
that
his
jeopardy
began
is
not
what
entitles
him
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it
then
becomes
a
question
of
what
is
the
meaning
of
"jeopardy".
but
insofar
as
the
court
imported
collateral
estoppel
into
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
it
should
keep
in
mind,
in
deciding
whether
to
extend
that
doctrine,
that
in
the
civil
context
a
crucial
predicate
for
collateral
estoppel
is
the
ability
of
the
adversely
affected
party
to
appeal,
and
that
is
because
before
we
rely
on
collateral
estoppel,
we
want
to
have
some
assurances
that
there
actually
is
integrity
to
the
necessarily
determined
fact
that
is
going
to
preclude
litigation
in
another
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
this
court's
decisions
since--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--since
1824,
this
court
has
defined
the
government's
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
include
the
right
to
retry
if
the
jury
hangs,
and
here
what
the
defendant--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
agree
that
it's
in
the
same
position--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--as
if
it
had
not
bought
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
--
it
--
in
this
case
what
the
government
did
was
to
bring
all
of
its
cases
together.
and
i
return
to
the
hypothetical
about
ashe
v.
swenson
because
i
think
it
--
it
strikes
everyone
as
very
strange
to
say
that
if
the
jury
in
ashe
v.
swenson
had
been
presented
with
all
six
robbers
and
had
acquitted
on
only
one
and
had
a
returned
--
you
know,
an
inability
to
reach
a
verdict--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
not
relying
on
dunn
in
this
hypothetical.
i'm
presupposing
that
the
jury
hung
with
respect
to
the
other
five
robbers.
and
all
the
government
would
come
back
and
say
is:
for
two
separate
reasons,
we
should
be
able
to
retry
those
counts
against
the
other
five
robbers.
one
is
that
when
there
is
a
hung
jury
it's
settled
double
jeopardy
law
that
the
government
has
an
opportunity
to
retry;
and
the
other
is
if
you
accept
the
proposition
that
the
jury's
action
was
inconsistent
because
one
of
the
robbers
earned
an
acquittal
and
the
other
five
logically
should
have
been
the
same
if
the
jury
had
found
that
the
defendant
wasn't
the
robber,
the
jury
was
unable
to
return
a
verdict.
collateral
estoppel
depends
on
the
idea
that
there
is
a
rational
jury,
and
if
a
jury
has
acted
inconsistently,
we
don't
have
that
basis
of
rationality
that
supports
the
policy
justifications
of
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
such
as
lenity
for
the
defendant.
the
government
doesn't
get
the
opportunity
to
appeal
an
acquittal.
the
government
doesn't
get
the
opportunity
to
go
behind
the
acquittal
and
ask
whether
the
jury
acted
rationally.
all
of
things
--
those
things
are
true
in
civil
cases
where
the
doctrine
of
issue
preclusion
applies.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
under--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
government
should
not
be
worse
off.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
the
reason
is
that
when,
justice
breyer,
you
said
that
double
jeopardy
is
not
involved
in
the
cases
involving
the
government's
ability
to
retry
on
a
hung
count,
that's
not
accurate.
the
court
has
regarded
the
doctrine
of
double
jeopardy
as
a
balance
of
policies,
and
one
of
the
fundamental
policies
is
when
the
jury
cannot
agree,
the
government
has
the
right
to
retry.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
i
think
you
still
have
to
focus
on
the
intrinsic
character
of
the
doctrine
of
issue
preclusion,
which
does
depend
on
a
rational
jury.
let's
apply
it
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
there
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
justice
ginsburg,
there
is
not.
the
government's
theory
here
was
that
on
the
substantive
securities
fraud
count,
which
related
to
the
january
20th,
2000,
analysts
meeting,
mr.
yeager
was
integrally
involved
in
formulating
the
message
and
was
therefore
accountable
for
misstatements
to
the
marketplace
about
enron
broadband
communications
efficacy
and
effectiveness
and
technological
value.
the
jury,
if
it
rejected
that,
would
acquit
on
those
counts
--
on
that
count,
without
reaching
the
question
did
mr.
yeager
know
factually
that
the
statements
that
were
made
by
others
at
that
analysts
conference
and
in
the
press
releases
subsequently
were
inaccurate?
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
he
had
the
information,
then
he
could
be
liable
for
insider
trading
even
though
he
is
not
liable
for
substantive
securities
fraud
because
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
creating
the
statements
or
misstatements
to
the
marketplace.
and
i
think
i
do
take
issue
with
petitioner's
suggestion
that
the
theory
of
this
case
was
an
omissions
theory.
the
way
that
mr.
yeager
argued
the
case
to
the
jury
was
that
i
didn't
have
any
involvement
in
preparing
or
making
statements
at
that
january
20th
analysts
conference;
you
can't
convict
me
of
what
other
people
may
have
said.
and
the
jury
instructions
advised
the
jury
that
it
had
to
find
that
he
participated
in
the
scheme
and
that
he
either
made
the
statements
or
caused
the
statements
or
omissions
to
be
made.
if
it
rejected
that,
it
easily
acquits
on
the
securities
fraud.
and
as
a
result,
even
if
this
court
were
inclined
to
apply
collateral
estoppel
across
mixed
counts
in
a
verdict
of
acquittals
and
hung
counts,
which
we
submit
it
should
not
do,
the
defendant
still
has
to
carry
his
burden
of
showing
necessarily
that
the
jury
resolved
an
issue
of
fact
in
his
favor
that
would
preclude
the
next
prosecution.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
view
that
mr.
yeager
did
not
contest
that
he
participated
in
the
planning
and
preparation
and
statements
that
were
made.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
it's
included
in
our
ability
to
defend
the
judgment.
the
district
court
in
this
case
made
it
quite
clear
that
collateral
estoppel
did
not
apply
because
the
acquittals
could
rest
on
the
basis
that
mr.
yeager
did
not
participate
in
the
analysts
conference
and
in
the
press
statements
that
were
the
basis
for
the
wire
fraud
and
the
securities
fraud
omissions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
you
could
resolve
it.
i
would
hope
that
you
would
resolve
it
in
a
favor
of
a
disposition
that
doesn't
require
you
to
reach
the
factual
issue,
but
if
the
court
resolves
the
legal
issue
against
us,
i
think
it
should
revisit
the
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
government
isn't
defending
the
precise
way
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
went
about
analyzing
the
double
jeopardy
issue,
and
its
question
of
what
facts
were
necessarily
determined
was
resolved
incorrectly,
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
clear
error.
i
don't
even
think
mr.
yeager
will
stand
up
on
rebuttal
and
tell
you
that
he
didn't
argue
to
the
jury
that
his
client
was
not
involved
in
--
in
the
creation
of
the
statements
at
that
analyst
meeting
because
he
did
make
that
argument.
and
i
do
think
that
it's
important
that
if
the
court
is
going
to
go
down
a
track
of
allowing
collateral
estoppel
for
mixed
verdicts,
that
it
encourage
rigor
in
the
way
that
courts
determine
whether
a
fact
was
necessarily
decided
by
the
jury.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
have
not
reasoned
it
the
way
that
the
government
reasons
it,
but
i
think
that
the
fifth
circuit's
result
is
equivalent
to
what
the
government
argued
as
well
as
the
d.c.
circuit.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy,
because
i
think
that
the
interest
that's
being
vindicated
here
is
a
balance
of
interests,
and
it's
--
as
i
responded
to
the
chief
justice
and
--
and
referred
to
justice
souter's
question
earlier,
double
jeopardy
has
never
been
a
jurisprudence
of
black
and
white.
you
could
you
read
the
clause
as
saying
one
trial
for
a
defendant.
if
the
defendant
is
--
doesn't
get
a
conviction
at
that
trial,
game
over.
but
the
court
has
never
done
that
because
the
double
jeopardy
clause
has
always
involved
a
balance
of
the
--
society's
very
important
interests
in
having
the
opportunity
for
a
decision
up
or
down
on
whether
a
defendant
is
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
the
--
if
the
jury
hangs,
the
government
can
retry.
there
have
been
cases
where--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
am
not
aware
whether
any
states
do,
but
certainly
as
a
matter
of
double
jeopardy,
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
there
is.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
prosecutors
who
are
unable
to
achieve
a
verdict
after
a
certain
number
of
trials
do
tend
to
conclude
that
it's
not
in
the
interest
of
society
to
keep
trying.
but
certainly
one
hung
jury
followed
by
a
retrial
is
customary
rather
than
an
exception
to
the
rule,
and
the
reason
why
that's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
--
i
--
justice
stevens,
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
the
first
jury
had
really
believed
that
mr.
yeager
acted
in
good
faith
and
was
completely
innocent,
it
should
have
acquitted
on
all
counts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
should
--
we
should
presume
that,
as
we
do
in
other
areas
of
the
law,
that
the
jury
followed
the
instructions
that
it
was
given,
and
the
instructions
that
it
was
given--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
i
think
that
there
is
no
reason
for
the
fact
that
a
jury
takes
irrational
action
to
then
be
used
for
the
jury's
acquittal
to
block
complete
prosecution.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
they
acted
irrationally
in
the
sense
that
if
a
fact
necessarily
determined
acquittals
on
the
--
on
the
insider
trading
counts--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
the
point
is
they
should
have
agreed
logically
if
they
believed
that
mr.
yeager
never
had
inside
information
or
acted
in
good
faith.
and
the
jury
is
instructed
to
consider
each
count,
count
by
count.
it
was
given
instructions
at
the
allen
phase
of
the
case
that
it
should
strive
to
achieve
a
verdict,
that
mr.
yeager
is
entitled
to
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
if,
in
fact,
the
jury
believes
that
he
is
not
guilty,
and
that
it
should
make
every
effort
to
reach
the
verdict.
now,
the
fact
that
it
didn't,
and
it
would
have
been
very
easy
for
it
to
do,
if
it
had
determined
logically
that
he
did
not
have
inside
information,
is
a
reason
for
hesitating
before
extrapolating
out
from
those
acquittals
and
blocking
the
government's
opportunity
to
retry
the
hung
counts.
mr.
yeager's
position
logically--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
--
i
don't
think
that
it
is
that
difficult
of
an
issue.
i
think
that
the
district
court,
which
was
closer
to
it,
which
had
presided
over
the
trial,
and
which
read
the
closing
arguments,
made
findings
that
make
it
quite
clear
what
mr.
yeager
argued
and
how
those
arguments
were
totally
consistent--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
not
sure
that
----
[laughter]
if
the
jury
was
confused
and
it
acted
in
an
irrational
manner,
that's
a
reason
not
to
apply
collateral
estoppel,
not
a
reason
to
do
it.
what
mr.
yeager's
theory
implies
is
that
if
the
jury
had
come
back
and
--
under
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
it
can
return
partial
verdicts.
if
the
jury
had
come
back
and
said,
we're
struggling
on
some
of
the
counts,
we
have
a
partial
verdict
on
others
of
them,
and
the
judge
said,
okay,
we'll
take
the
partial
verdict;
and
the
jury
came
in
and
said,
we
acquit
on
five
counts,
that
mr.
yeager's
theory
would
be
that
the
judge
should
say,
well,
that's
great,
collateral
estoppel
now
means
you
don't
get
to
finish
the
deliberations
on
the
counts
on
which
you
said
you
can't
agree.
and
that
result
makes
no
sense,
neither
does
blocking
retrial
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
assume
i
can
answer
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
because
the
--
the
logic
of
--
of
the
situation
here
is
that
in
order
for
collateral
estoppel
to
apply,
there
needs
to
be
a
rational
jury
verdict.
and
ashe
v.
swenson
tells
us
that
in
attempting
to
decide
what
the
jury
rationally
resolved,
we
look
at
all
evidence
in
the
record,
not
just
some.
so
it
isn't
necessary
to
treat
the
jury's
hung
counts
as
if
they
are
verdicts
of
a
sort.
they
simply
are
data
which
show
that
if
the
jury
had
been
rational
and
it
had
resolved
a
fact
in
favor
of
the
defendant
that
was
necessary
for
the
government
to
prove
on
the
other
counts,
it
would
have
resolved
those
as
acquittals
as
well.
and
once
you
take
into
account
that
total
record,
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
with
its
premise
of
rationality
cannot
be
applied.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you.
