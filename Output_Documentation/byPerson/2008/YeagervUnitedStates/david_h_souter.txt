justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
buffone,
may
i
raise
one
preliminary
issue?
and
it's
an
issue
which
is
--
does
not
go
to
the
reason
we
took
the
case,
but
i'd
like
your
response
to
it.
your
argument,
your
ashe
v.
swenson
argument,
assumes,
as
you
have
said
in
the
brief,
that
the
--
that
the
verdicts
of
acquittal
essentially
determined
that
your
client
did
not
possess
insider
knowledge,
and
i
question
whether
the
verdicts
of
acquittal
did
necessarily
establish
that
fact.
i've
looked
at
the
--
at
the
jury
instructions,
and
i
--
i
will
be
candid
to
say
i
did
not
parse
the
whole
jury
instruction,
so
you
may
very
well
correct
me
in
the
assumption
that
i'm
going
to
make.
but
the
point
of
the
--
of
the
jury
instruction
that
seemed
to
go
to
your
argument
is
set
out
on
page
105
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
the
judge
is
telling
the
jurors
what
they
had
to
find.
and
one
of
them
was
that
your
client
made
any
untrue
statement
of
material
fact
or
omitted
to
state
a
material
fact
necessary
in
order
to
make
the
statements
made,
in
the
light
of
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
made,
not
misleading
as
charged.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
jury
under
that
instruction
could
have
come
back
with
a
verdict
of
acquittal
simply
on
the
assumption
that
your
client
had
not
made
affirmative
statements
at
the
--
at
the
meeting
in
question,
therefore
he
had
no
obligation
to
--
to
correct
any
statements,
because
it
is
not
clear
from
this
instruction
that
he
had
to
correct
the
statements
of
other
people
who
omitted
material
facts,
and
that
therefore
the
only
thing
that
the
verdict
proves
or
the
only
thing
that
the
verdict
may
have
assumed
is
that
he
didn't
speak
up
and
say
anything.
is
that
a
possible
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
--
i
agree
that
--
that
did
seem
to
be
the
point
of
the
cross-examination,
and
in
fact
i
guess
you
set
it
out
in
one
of
the
briefs.
but
is
--
is
that
enough?
we
--
to
my
knowledge,
we've
never
held
that
that
is
enough
to
convert
or
--
let's
say,
to
--
to
--
for
us
to
assume,
despite
a
more
protean
jury
instruction,
that
the
jury
necessarily
had
to
find
a
--
a
fact.
and
i
guess
maybe
my
question
boils
down
to
is:
why
should
what
perhaps
consumed
60
or
80
seconds
of
cross-examination
suffice
to
tighten
up
a
jury
instruction
which
--
which
basically
is
open-ended?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
buffone,
you're
--
you're
going
through
a
logical
analysis.
if
i
understand
your
position,
the
logical
analysis
is
not
going
to
win
the
case
for
you
because,
as
i
understand
the
case
that
we've
got
in
front
of
us,
we
have
in
effect
two
lines
of
authority,
two
models,
that
describe
what
the
law
might
be
in
these
circumstances.
one
model,
on
--
on
the
assumption
that
--
that
the
acquittals
determined
what
you
say
they
did
--
on
that
model
there
--
there
is
--
there
is
an
issue
preclusion
that
is
raised.
on
the
second
model,
the
model
of
what
we
do
in
the
case
of
a
hung
jury,
there
is
no
--
of
course,
no
preclusion,
and
there
is
no
bar
to
a
retrial.
and
we've
simply
got
both
in
the
same
case.
the
question
is:
which
model
do
we
follow?
do
we
say
preclusion
is
the
most
important
issue
here,
or
do
we
say
the
open-endedness
and
uncertainty
of
the
hung
jury,
the
--
the
failure
to
reach
a
verdict,
is
the
model
that
--
that
tells
us
what
we
ought
to
do?
how
do
we
choose
between
those
two
possibilities,
each
of
which
is
open
to
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
look,
i
know
that,
and
--
and
by
the
same
token,
hung
juries
have
long
been
recognized
as
raising
no
bar
to
a
further
trial.
and
the
question
is:
why
are
the
values
in
the
--
the
acquittal
case
predominating,
as
you
say
they
are,
over
the
values
of
the
retrial
possibilities?
why
do
i
choose
one
rather
than
another?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
have
got
both.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
--
what
is
it
--
and
i
would
almost
suggest
that
it
has
to
be
something
outside
the
lines
of
authority,
because
the
issue
here
is
which
line
of
authority
are
you
going
to
pick?
what
is
it
outside
the
lines
of
authority
that
says
we
should
--
we
should
pick
the
acquittal
model
rather
than
the
hung
jury
model
to
determine
what
to
do
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
--
isn't
the
real
problem
that
--
that
you
raised
by
your
answer
the
following
problem:
that
in
this
age
in
which
there
are,
as
justice
breyer's
hypo
suggests,
lots
of
overlapping
criminal
statutes
--
you
can
indict
not
only
for
drugs
but
for
telephones,
and
i
don't
know
what
other
overlapping
crimes
there
--
there
may
be.
therefore,
that
gives
the
government
by
joining
a
lot
of
overlapping
charges
or
lots
of
charges
with
common
elements
in
either
one
indictment
through
various
counts
or
simply
by
a
series
of
indictments
to
be
tried
together
--
it
gives
the
government
a
bigger
chance
of
getting
a
hung
jury
or
some
irrational
resolution
on
some
of
those
issues.
and
if
the
government
can
bring
loads
of
counts,
increase
the
likelihood
of
getting
a
hung
jury
on
one
issue
or
one
indictment,
the
government
in
effect
has
a
key
to
avoiding
just
what
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
suggested.
if
they
wait
and
bring
the
second
count
in
june,
there's
an
issue
preclusion.
but
if
they
bring
it
together,
they've
got
an
irrational
verdict,
and
there's
no
issue
preclusion.
therefore,
isn't
the
policy
behind
both
double
jeopardy
and
the
issue
preclusion
extension
a
policy
that
argues
in
favor
of
saying,
don't
let
the
government
have
all
these
bites
at
the
apple,
because
in
fact
it
results
or
can
result
in
seriatim
prosecutions?
what's
--
what's
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
does
the
--
does
the
government
ask
for
something
more
than
one
fair
chance
when
it
comes
in
with
117
counts?
maybe
the
fair
chance
consists
of
a
fair
chance
with
a
number
of
counts
or
a
number
of
indictments
that
one
can
reasonably
expect
a
--
a
jury
to
handle
without
either
getting
totally
confused
or
totally
exhausted.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
that's
right.
i'm
making
an
argument
that
he
did
not
make.
