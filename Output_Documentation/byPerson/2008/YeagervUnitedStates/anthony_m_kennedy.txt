but
in
a
sense
that's
justice
scalia's
point,
that
the
jury
has
in
effect
told
us
nothing,
and
in
effect
that
argument
hurts
your
case
in
one
sense.
hung
counts
are
meaningless.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
that
first
theory,
in
your
theory
that
a
retrial
on
hung
counts
is
always
permitted,
i
--
i
take
it
there
are
no
court
of
appeals
opinions
or
decisions
that
agree
with
you
on
that
point,
or
am
i
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
different
question:
suppose
you
prevail.
the
hung
counts
are
retried.
and
the
jury
hangs
again,
and
the
jury
hangs
a
second
time.
is
there
any
point
at
which
the
district
court
can
intervene
in
the
exercise
of
its
own
authority
and
discretion
just
to
dismiss
the
charges?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
the
government
can
try
year
after
year
to
get
a
conviction
and
wear
the
defendant
down?
nothing
the
court
can
do
so
long
as
there's
a
hung
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
the
rule
in
all
of
the
states?
don't
some
states
give
authority
to
the
judges
to
say,
enough
is
enough?
