justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
as
an
example,
to
follow
up
on
justice
breyer's
question
--
and
then
can
you
answer
his
question
--
many
states
have
rules
that
you
have
to
be
a
resident
of
the
county
to
serve
on
that
jury.
and
suppose
a
juror
thinks
he
or
she
is
a
resident
and
gets
the
county
line
wrong
or
doesn't
know
what
the
residency
requirement.
under
your
rule
--
what
is
your
term,
an
"unlawful
adjudicator".
and
then
we
have
a
--
we
have
a
--
a
federal
constitutional
standard
that
requires
structural
error
for
any
state
--
for
any
violation
of
any
state
--
state
rule.
that
is
justice
breyer's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
are
--
you
are
avoiding
the
question
by
saying,
oh,
don't
worry,
there
are
not
going
to
be
many
violations
of
this
sort,
and
then
you
pick
out
age.
but
justice
breyer
began
--
the
preface
to
his
question
was
--
was
that
there
are
--
are
manifold
requirements
varying
from
state
to
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
you
are
giving
us
is
a
sweeping
proposition,
a,
for
the
constitutional
principles
that
you
are
setting
forth;
b,
for
the
supervision
and
intrusion
it
would
cause
federal
courts
on
the
state
system.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
our
footnote
in
our
later
case
authored
by
justice
scalia
indicates
considerable
doubt
as
to
the
viability
and
to
the
--
to
the
correctness
of
that
formulation
in
swain.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
salazar,
i
think,
is
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no.
no.
i
thought
you
were
citing
swain
--
and
i
think
you
are
going
to
have
to
establish
--
that
peremptory
--
in
this
case,
to
win
your
case,
that
there
is
a
constitutional
basis,
a
constitutional
right
to
exercise
a
peremptory
challenge,
at
least
--
then
you
can
have
a
subset
of
that,
when
the
state
gives
it
to
you.
but
i
think
swain
no
longer
stands
for
that
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
how
--
how
could
it
do
that
if
there
were
not
some
underlying
federal
constitutional
right?
i
say
"how
could
it
do
that".
it's
obvious
that
they
did
it.
what
--
what
would
be
the
principled
basis
for
that
analysis?
what
would
be
the
analytic
framework
that
would
lead
it
to
look
to
the
federal
decisions?
this
is
a
state
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
are
asking
you
what
the
analytic
justification
for
that
course
of
reasoning
is
if
that
is
indeed
its
course
of
reasoning.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
have
to
give
us
a
sustainable
analytic
framework
if
--
if
we
are
going
to
reverse
their
decision.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
case
would
you
cite
for
that
proposition?
and
you
can't
say
michigan
v.
long.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
this
johnson
v.
standard
oil
and
that
--
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
the
reasons
that
have
been
discussed,
it
may
be
that
we
won't
get
to
the
merits
of
the
petitioner's
argument.
but
assuming
we
do,
the
petitioner
talks
about
the
--
i
don't
have
--
the
"unlawfully
constituted
jury".
is
--
is
--
what
is
the
distinction
between
the
hypothetical
case
of
the
juror
who
isn't
a
resident
of
the
county
and
the
state
says
you
have
to
be
a
resident
of
the
county,
what
is
the
distinction
between
that
and,
say,
a
non-article
iii
judge
sitting
on
a
court
of
appeals
panel?
why
is
one
structural
and
the
other
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
would
--
this
would
be
a
little
different
than
the
juror
who
might
be
biased
or
might
not
be
biased,
because
this
goes
to
a
hard
qualification.
it's
just
a
hypothetical
in
the
case,
but
it's
a
--
it's
a
linchpin
to
the
petitioner's
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
--
but
the
hypothetical
is
it
doesn't
--
the
juror
doesn't
satisfy
the
requirement
because
he
or
she
is
from
the
wrong
county.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
that
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
an
illinois
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
a
case
in
which
an
alien
sat
on
the
jury,
and
there
was,
i
believe,
as
part
of
the
court's
analysis
a
failure
to
make
contemporaneous
objection.
but
they
said
it
was
not
a
"nullity",
to
use
the
court's
words,
to
seat
this
improper
juror
and,
again,
made
as
a
determination
of
illinois
law,
just
as
the
question
here
as
to
what
remedy
should
be
in
effect
is
purely
a
question
of
illinois
law.
again,
they
have
simply
failed
to
establish
a
due
process
violation.
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
that
there
is
no
due
process
entitlement
to
peremptory
challenges.
much
of
what
we
accept
as
given
these
days
depends,
hinges,
upon
that
presumption,
including
the
batson
line,
as
the
concurrence
in
miller-el
pointed
out
in
2005,
numerous
restrictions
on
peremptories
that
have
been
upheld
since
the
19th
century,
which
are
laid
out
in
the
government's
brief.
and
indeed,
the
remarkable
variety
amongst
states,
some
of
which
has
been
touched
upon
today,
where
states,
state
by
state,
provide
very
different
numbers
of
peremptory
challenges
and
they
provide
very
different
limits
thereon
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
will
use
that
as
an
examination
question,
but
let's
hope
that
it
doesn't
come
up.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
don't
some
of
those
courts,
rather
than
focusing
on
the
qualifications
of
the
particular
juror,
look
to
the
--
how
close
the
case
was?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
any
number
of
alternatives
that
we
can
adopt
in
ruling
for
your
position.
if
we
were
to
rule
for
your
position,
what
do
you
think
is
the
most
straightforward
rationale?
