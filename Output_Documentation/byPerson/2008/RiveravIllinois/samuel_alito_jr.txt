justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
the
constitution
prohibits
the
state
from
going
further
than
batson
to
protect
against
the
use
of
peremptory
challenges
for
discriminatory
purposes?
specifically,
is
there
any
reason
why
a
state
could
not
provide
that
whenever
--
that
a
trial
judge
always
has
the
authority,
when
the
judge
has
any
suspicion
of
discrimination,
to
ask
for
an
explanation
from
counsel
as
to
the
reason,
without
having
to
establish
--
without
there
having
to
be
a
prima
facie
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
judge
who
sat
on
a
state
trial
was
not
authorized
under
state
law
to
hear
that
particular
matter,
would
that
be
a
due
process
violation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
it's
not
a
single
challenge?
what
if,
let's
say,
each
side
has
six,
and
the
trial
judge
just
arbitrarily
refuses
to
allow
a
defendant
to
exercise
any
peremptory
challenge,
but
the
jury
--
the
jury
that's
ultimately
selected,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
it's
not
a
fair
jury?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
that
any
harder
than
harmless
error
analysis
that
is
conducted
all
the
time?
for
example,
evidence
is
erroneously
excluded
from
the
trial
and
you
ask,
was
that
a
harmless
error?
but
you
have
to
--
there
has
to
be
speculation
about
how
this
jury
would
have
received
the
additional
evidence.
what
--
what's
the
difference?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
court
has
no
--
has
no
inside
information
about
the
dynamics
of
that
particular
jury.
it's
just
--
it's
deciding
what
a
rational
jury
would
do,
what
a
--
what
a
standard
jury
would
do.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
but
how
does
the
court
know
anything
particular
about
the
jury
when
it
conducts
that
harmless
error
analysis?
it
doesn't.
