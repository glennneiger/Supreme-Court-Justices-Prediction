justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
assuming
a
federal
violation
when
it
decided
what
the
reversal
rule
would
be.
but
your
federal
violation
determines
--
is
bottomed
on
the
notion
that
there
was
an
unlawful
adjudicator
on
the
jury.
would
that
reasoning
apply,
in
regard
to
one
of
the
earlier
questions,
if
you
have
a
cook
county
jury
and
they
had
a
juror
from
du
page
county
and
the
law
says
no,
you
have
got
to
have
a
local
juror,
and
it
turns
out
that
they
had
wrongly
seated
such
a
juror?
would
that
be
an
unlawful
adjudicator.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
have
one
more
thought.
and
if
it
is
such
an
unlawful
adjudicator,
it
would
definitely
be
federal
constitutional
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
justice
alito's
question
is
could
the
state
say
as
a
matter
of
state
law
whenever
the
trial
judge
has
a
hunch
that
there
might
have
been
discriminatory
purpose
involved,
may
he
refuse
to
allow
the
preemptory
challenge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
--
if
the
state
explicitly
gave
the
trial
judge
that
authority,
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
do
you
think
we
would
have
jurisdiction
of
this
certiorari
petition
if
we
were
convinced
there
was
no
federal
constitutional
error;
they
were
merely
trying
to
decide
whether
the
state
court
applied
the
correct
constitutional
standard
in
correcting
what
it
thought
was
a
federal
constitutional
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
there
is
none
there,
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
to
answer
and
give
an
advisory
opinion
on
how
the
illinois
supreme
court
should
run
its
shop.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
--
they
did
make
that
assumption,
but
you
think
the
assumption
is
wrong.
and
if
we
think
the
assumption
is
wrong,
you
would
agree
with
justice
scalia
that
we
can
go
ahead
and
say,
well,
you
are
running
for
reelection,
so
we
are
going
to
correct
your
errors
on
federal
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
--
supposing
illinois
had
a
statute
that
said
the
prosecution
gets
ten
peremptories
and
the
defendants
get
one.
would
that
raise
a
federal
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
answer
pretty
clear
that
that
would
be
unfair?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
reason
it's
unlikely
is
it's
so
clearly
unconstitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
almost
the
same,
at
least
in
some
states,
as
getting
a
new
trial
anyway.
if
we
find
out
after
the
fact
that
the
juror
was
biased,
then
in
some
states
that's
--
that's
a
reason
for
a
new
trial
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
point
is
you
are
not
giving
much
substance
to
the
rule.
