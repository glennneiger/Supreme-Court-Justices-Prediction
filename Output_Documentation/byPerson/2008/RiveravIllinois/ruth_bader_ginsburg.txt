are
you
putting
--
are
you
equating
this
with
a
biased
judge?
the
--
the
category
of
structural
error
has
been
kept
very
narrow
by
this
court.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
juror
who
is
perfectly
qualified,
who
is
conceded
--
it
is
conceded
could
not
have
been
dismissed
for
cause,
is
quite
a
different
matter
than
a
judge
who
--
who
has
taken
a
bribe
or
who
has
a
monetary
stake
in
the
case.
it
--
it
seems
quite
a
stretch
to
apply
those
decisions
to
--
to
the
case
of
a
juror
who
was
qualified,
and
it
was
just
a
judge
who
was
overexuberant
in
denying
a
peremptory
challenge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
no
--
no
constitutional
right,
no
constitutional
right
to
the
peremptory
challenge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
not
--
you're
not
suggesting,
because
you
conceded
there
was
no
basis
for
a
for-cause
challenge,
you
are
not
--
you
are
not
saying
that
gomez
was
unqualified
or
that
she
was
biased.
if
she
was
biased,
you
had
a
basis
for
that;
she
could
be
excused
for
cause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
she
was
an
administrator.
she
wasn't
a
nurse.
she
didn't
deal
with
people
who
had
gunshot
wounds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
--
well,
first,
how
many
peremptories
does
illinois
law
allow?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
suppose
a
state
allowed
only
three
peremptory
challenges.
there
would
be
nothing
in
the
least
unconstitutional
about
that,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
was
number
four,
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
challenge
to
gomez
was
the
number
four
peremptory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
if
the
state
had
only
three
which
it
could
do,
there
would
be
--
would
be
no
basis
for
removing
gomez
from
the
array.
that
is,
the
--
the
defense
would
have
already
exercised
three
peremptory
challenges;
she's
number
four,
too
bad.
that
would
be
the
end
of
it,
right?
she
would
sit
on
the
jury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
just
something
unseemly
about
saying
because
the
state
is
generous
in
its
peremptories,
you
have
a
grand
constitutional
argument
to
make,
even
though
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
any
peremptory
challenge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
had
an
actual
jury.
it's
not
as
though
you
had
no
jury
verdict
and
then
the
court
would
say
--
the
court
would
say,
we
think
that
this
defendant
was
as
guilty
as
they
come;
but
you
had
a
jury
with
jurors
who
met
all
the
state
law
qualifications,
already
made
the
determination
of
guilt.
so
that's
a
little
different
from
the
case
where,
say,
a
judge
would
attempt
the
equivalent
of
a
directed
verdict.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
--
then
you
would
have
no
objection
to
a
remand
that
says,
illinois
supreme
court,
you
can't
blame
it
on
federal
law.
it's
up
to
you
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
and
now
answer
the
question
that
you
didn't
answer;
that
is,
what
is
the
consequence
under
state
law
of
an
erroneous
denial
of
a
peremptory?
you
would
have
no
objection
to
such
a
remand?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
roberts,
if
you
do
get
to
harmless
error,
how
do
you
deal
with
the
question
that
was
raised
by
the
chief
justice?
that
is,
there
is
no
way
in
the
world
that
you
can
tell
whether
this
was
harmless
or
not?
you
have
to
imagine
another
juror
being
on
the
panel,
that
juror
could
have
swung
the
case,
could
have
had
no
influence.
there's
just
no
way
of
knowing
what
would
have
happened.

a
state
trial
court
erroneously
denied
a
criminal
defendant's
peremptory
challenge.
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
does
that
error
require
automatic
reversal
of
the
defendant's
conviction
even
if
all
of
the
jurors
actually
seated
are
qualified
and
unbiased?
that
is
the
question
this
case
presents.
petitioner
michael
rivera
was
charged
with
first-degree
murder
in
an
illinois
state
court.
during
jury
selection,
rivera
attempted
to
use
a
peremptory
challenge
against
perspective
juror,
deloris
gomez.
concerned
that
rivera's
challenge
was
discriminatory
on
the
basis
of
race
or
gender
and
is
contrary
to
our
decisions
in
batson
v.
kentucky
and
related
cases,
the
trial
court
refused
to
allow
it.
because
rivera
had
no
basis
to
challenge
gomez
for
cause,
she
was
ceded
on
the
jury.
following
trial,
the
jury
with
gomez
as
its
foreperson
found
rivera
guilty.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
rejecting
rivera's
peremptory
challenge.
it
further
held,
however,
that
the
error
was
harmless
and
did
not
warrant
reversal
of
rivera's
conviction.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
a
state
trial
court's
good-faith
but
erroneous
denial
of
a
criminal
defendant's
peremptory
challenge,
we
hold,
does
not
require
automatic
reversal
of
the
defendant's
conviction
provided
that
all

seated
on
the
jury
are
qualified
and
unbiased.
we
have
long
recognized
the
peremptory
challenges
are
not
a
matter
of
federal

right.
states
may
withhold
peremptory
challenges
altogether
without
impairing
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
a
fair
trial
before
an
impartial
jury.
because
the
defendant's
exercise
of
peremptory
challenges
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
a
state
court's
mistaken
denial
of
a
peremptory
challenge
does
not,
without
law,
violate
the
federal
constitution.
in
this

if
arguably
overzealous,
effort
to
enforce
our
batson-related
decisions.

all
that

they
may
conclude,

implicitly
did
here,
that
