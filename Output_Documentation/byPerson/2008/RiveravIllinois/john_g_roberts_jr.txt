chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-9995,
rivera
v.
illinois.
mr.
leven.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
would
it
have
to
be
--
would
it
have
to
be
structural
error?
i
--
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
argue
that
it's
structural
error
when
the
error
is
a
wrongful
denial
of
a
peremptory
challenge,
because
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
establish
the
harmfulness
of
error
because,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
a
peremptory
challenge
is
just
a
hunch
on
your
part;
you
don't
need
any
more.
but
if
it's
something
like
he
was
in
du
page
county
rather
than
cook
county,
maybe
that's
something
where
it's
fair
to
put
the
burden
of
showing
harmfulness
on
the
defendant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe
that's
true.
my
point
is
that
may
be
true
with
respect
to
a
peremptory
challenge,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
terribly
difficult
to
say,
well,
he
lives
in
du
page
county
and
not
cook
county,
so
what's
the
big
deal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
scodro.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
is
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
but
how
do
you
--
there
is
no
way
to
tell.
i
mean,
presumably
the
state
has
a
reason
for
restricting
the
jury
pool
to
the
neighborhood.
i
mean,
and
that
type
of
limitation
does
go
back
to
blackstone,
the
vicinage
of
the
--
of
the
crime.
so
--
and
there's
no
way
to
tell.
there's
no
way
to
tell
whether
the
juror
from
du
page
county
is
going
to
have
a
different
view
or
a
different
perspective
or
affected
it
in
a
--
or
that
it
affected
the
verdict
in
a
particular
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
maybe
--
maybe
you
have
an
--
you
know,
the
irrational
juror,
you
know,
the
holdout
is
not
going
to
convict
for
any
reason.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
you
get
--
well,
even
assuming
your
--
your
premise,
isn't
it
pretty
difficult
to
know
what
a
rational
juror
would
have
done?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
because
there
is
no
way
to
tell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
a
jury
is
a
fundamental
protection
of
individual
liberty,
and
in
your
analysis
you
are
having
a
judge
decide
what
the
jury
would
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
judge
is
making
the
determination
that
a
juror
that
should
have
been
seated
would
act
like
the
juror
who
was
seated
instead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
leven,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-9995,
rivera
versus
illinois.
