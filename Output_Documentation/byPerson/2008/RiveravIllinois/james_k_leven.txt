mr.
james
k.
leven
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
lawfully
exercised
a
peremptory
challenge
on
juror
delores
gomez.
as
a
result
of
the
erroneous
denial
of
that
challenge,
ms.
gomez
wrongfully
sat
on
the
jury
and
lacked
authority
to
render
a
judgment.
petitioner's
conviction
should
be
reversed
automatically
for
three
separate
and
independent
reasons.
first,
the
trial
before
an
unlawful
adjudicator
is
structural
error.
two,
the
wrongful
seating
of
a
juror
is
structural
error,
because
the
effect
of
the
error
is
impossible
to
determine--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
our
unlawful
adjudicator
claim
is
not
dependent
on
a
finding
or
showing
of
bias.
a
--
a
juror
who
is
illegally
on
the
jury,
who
does
not
have
the
authority
to
serve,
would
render
the
jury
improperly
constituted.
therefore,
there
would
be
structural
error
for
a
jury
illegally
constituted
to
render
a
judgment
irrespective
of
bias.
mr.
james
k.
leven
well,
your
honor,
there
are
state
law
and
federal
law
components
to
this
issue.
petitioner
had
a
lawful
right
to
excuse
juror
gomez
under
illinois
supreme
court
rule
434.
mr.
james
k.
leven
well,
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
due
process
involved
that--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--no,
your
honor.
the
--
our
argument
is
very
narrow
in
scope:
that
if
a
--
a
juror
that
is
illegally
constituted
renders
a
verdict
of
guilty,
then
that
jury
is
an
unlawful
adjudicator.
the
unlawful
adjudicator
claim
is
what
triggers
the
right
to
due
process.
mr.
james
k.
leven
well,
with
respect
to
jury
qualifications
such
as
age
and
citizenship,
there
is
a
very
delicate
screening
process
that
goes
into
effect.
so
the
problem
of
an
unlawful
adjudicator
with
respect
to,
say,
age
would
be
a
very,
very
rare
phenomenon
and
would
rarely
occur,
because
jurors
who
are
too
young
to
serve,
perhaps
under
18
years
old,
would
never
make
their
way
to
the
jury
pool
in
the
first
place.
so
it
would
really
be
a
very
rare
situation--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
i
think--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
if
we
take
the
juror's
qualifications
that
were
discussed
in
the
state's
brief,
it
would
appear
that
all
the
qualifications
that
are
discussed
there
would
--
as
i
said,
it
would
be
a
very
rare
situation,
indeed,
for
a--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
gomez
v.
united
states
set
forth
the
principle
equating
the
right
to
an
adjudicator
with
lawful
authority
to
preside
at
every
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
that
--
that
case
did
not
involve
jurors,
your
honor,
but
it
did
involve
a
magistrate
who
lacked
the
authority
to
preside
over
voir
dire.
and
the
court
held
under
a
general
principle
of
law
equating
the
right
of
--
the
lawful-authority
right
to
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury
and
used
the
phrase
"a
basic
fair
trial
right",
meaning
that
the
right
to
a
lawful
adjudicator
is
a
basic
fair
trial
right.
and
also
in
addition--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
bias
with
respect
to
gomez
because
of
her
extensive
contacts
with
gunshot
victims
at
cook
county
hospital--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
the
illinois
supreme
court
held
that
defense
counsel's
strike
of
gomez
was
a
valid
reason
to
have
her
removed
from
the
jury.
she
could
have,
even
though
she
said
--
even
though
she
was
not
challengeable
for
cause,
the
peremptory
challenge
is
there
for
a
purpose,
and
that
is--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--the
peremptory
--
if
i
understand.
mr.
james
k.
leven
well,
the
purpose
of
the
peremptory
challenge
is
to
help
to
create
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
mr.
james
k.
leven
that's
right.
under
swain
v.
alabama,
a
peremptory
challenge
can
be
exercised
without
having
to
state
a
reason.
mr.
james
k.
leven
well,
with--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--yes,
martinez-salazar
in
its
footnote
4
determined
that
the
automatic
reversal
rule
in
swain
was
subject
to
reconsideration
due
to
the
advent
of
harmless
error
analysis.
but
i
was
citing
swain
for
a
different
purpose.
i
was
citing
swain
that
--
for
the
purpose
that
a
peremptory
challenge
can
be
exercised
without
having
to
state
a
reason,
and
that's
a
fundamental--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--i
wasn't
citing
it
for
that
proposition,
your
honor.
we
have
the
case
of
evitts
v.
lucey,
for
example,
where
the
court
was
analyzing
the
right
to
an
appeal.
and
the
court
found
that
the
right
to
an
appeal
was
not
of
constitutional
origin,
but
once
the
state
had
created
a
right
to
an
appeal
it
had
the
obligation
to
administer
that
right
consistently
with
fundamental
fairness
and
due
process.
so
here
we
have
a
peremptory
right
that
the
state
of
illinois
wasn't
obligated
to
create.
but
once
it
adopted
that
peremptory
right,
it
was
in
effect
adopting
the
long
venerable
tradition
of
peremptory
challenges
that
has
existed
in
this
country
since
the
founding.
mr.
james
k.
leven
for
non-capital
cases,
it's
seven,
your
honor.
mr.
james
k.
leven
well,
under
ross
v.
oklahoma,
the
state
has
the
authority
to
regulate
peremptory
challenges.
mr.
james
k.
leven
i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
k.
leven
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
k.
leven
well,
as
to
our
unlawful
adjudicator
claim
that
would
be
correct,
because
if
the
defense
did
not
have
a
peremptory
challenge
to
exercise
in
order
to
strike
gomez
if
the
peremptories
had
run
out--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
the
state
is
obligated,
consistent
with
due
process,
to
provide
that
which
it
promised.
and
the
problem--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
what
makes
the
peremptory
challenge
unique
is
its
venerable
tradition
since
the
time--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
if
i
understand
correctly,
your
honor,
the
case
involves
peremptory
challenges.
mr.
james
k.
leven
yes.
mr.
james
k.
leven
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
every
violation
of
state
law,
if
unremedied--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--because
this
one
involves
a
state
violation
that
resulted
in
an
unlawful
adjudicator.
let's
take--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
the
state
disagreed
with
our
position
as
to
the
federal
automatic
reversal
law.
the
court
applied,
and
we
would
argue
misapplied--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--i
would
read
the
illinois
supreme
court
opinion
--
specifically
what
they
did
state
is
that
the
trial
court
was
incorrect
in
denying
the
peremptory
challenge,
therefore
that
juror
should
not
have
sat
on
the
jury,
that
juror
was
wrongfully
on
the
jury.
mr.
james
k.
leven
well,
the
illinois
supreme
court
made
one
statement,
that
the
peremptory
was
wrongfully
denied.
now,
as
far
as
elaborating
on
its
reasoning--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--no,
because
the
court
misapplied
this
court's
precedent
in
neder
and
martinez-salazar.
that's
the
basis
for
the
court
affirming
the
conviction.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
of
whether
or
not--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--the
illinois
supreme
court
found
that
the
verdict
was
valid
because
they
thought
that
the
error
was
subject
to
harmless
error
review,
in
relying
on
neder
and
martinez-salazar.
mr.
james
k.
leven
well,
there
is
an
error
in
terms
of
the
adjudicator,
ms.
gomez,
being
seated
on
the
jury
and
under
rule
434
petitioner
had
the
right
to
a
juror
that
--
that
was
not
subject
to
a
peremptory
challenge.
gomez
was
wrongfully
seated
on
that
jury.
mr.
james
k.
leven
i
don't
read
the
opinion
that
way.
i
read--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--because
they
thought
that
the
error
was
subject
to
harmless
error
review
under
federal
law.
and
we
would
argue
the
two
positions.
mr.
james
k.
leven
no.
the
court
declined
to
determine
whether
a
constitutional
right
had
been
violated,
but
the
court
applied
this
court's
precedent
under
martinez-salazar
and
neder,
the
federal
harmless
error
automatically
reversal
law
that
this
court
has,
and
used
that
to
find
that
the
error
was
subject
to
harmless
error
review.
the
court
did
not--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
the
court
did
not
specify
why
it
did
so,
but
it
did
rely
on
neder
and
martinez-salazar.
and
therefore--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
it's
hard
for
me
to
speculate
on
the
thinking
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
but--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
we
argued
at
the
illinois
supreme
court
level
that
due
process
was
violated;
but
the
illinois
supreme
court
declined
to
consider
whether
a
constitutional
right
had
been
violated
and
moved
accordingly
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
automatic
reversal
would
apply
or
whether
the
error
would
be
subject
to
harmless
error
review.
but
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
say
anything
about
whether
a
constitutional
right
had
been
violated
except
it
declined
to
consider
that
issue,
even
though
it
was
argued
at
that
level
by
--
by
petitioner.
not
only
do
we
have
a
constitutional
basis
for
this
court
to
have
access
to
its
automatic
reversal
law;
the
fact
that
the
court
did
rely
on
--
the
illinois
supreme
court
relied
on
neder
and
martinez-salazar
gives
this
court
authority
to
reach
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
to
apply
automatic
reversal
law
under
--
under
its
authority
to
correct--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--yes,
it
would
appear
so
if
it
--
if
a
state
law
stated
that
a
juror
qualification
requirement
is
that
the
juror
who
presides
in
cook
county
must
be
a
resident
of
the
county.
mr.
james
k.
leven
yes,
because
it
would
implicate
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
james
k.
leven
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
state
under
chapman
would
be
required
to
prove
harmlessness,
and
i
think
it
would
be
impossible
to
determine
whether
this
--
this
error
would
be
harmful--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
under
harmless
error
review,
the
appellate
court
envisions
the
actual
jury
that
rendered
the
verdict,
whether
or
not
the
error
would
have
rendered
the
verdict
different
had
it
been
--
had
it
not
occurred.
and
in
this
case
we
have
a
--
we
can't
analyze
it
from
the
perspective
of
whether
this
jury
would
have
rendered
the
same
verdict
absent
the
error,
because
this
jury
that
rendered
the
verdict
is
illegally
composed,
it's
illegitimate.
so
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
in
analyzing
harmless
error
review
is
it
substituted
its
judgment
for
--
for
the
reviewing
court,
it
substituted
its
judgment
for
the
--
for
the
jury.
the--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
in
this
case
i
don't
think
we
can
look
at
it
from
the
perspective
that
the
court
normally
looks
at
it
from
when
it
reviews
--
adopts
harmless
error
review.
in
the
normal
situation
the
court
looks
at
whether
or
not
the
error
contributed
to
the
verdict
and
whether
or
not
the
actual
jury
that
rendered
the
verdict
would
have
rendered
the
same
verdict
absent
the
error.
but
we
don't
have
--
we
can't
do
it
from
the
perspective
of
the
actual
jury
in
this
case,
because
the
actual
jury
here
is
illegal.
mr.
james
k.
leven
well,
that's
our
position,
your
honor,
because
what
the
trial
judge
did
in
this
case
is
asked
for
a
reason
without
having
established
any
prima
facie
case.
mr.
james
k.
leven
i
apologize,
your
honor;
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
about
going
further
than.
under
batson
there
is
a
three-step
process,
and
the
state
must
establish
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
before
the
judge
is
entitled
to
ask
for
any
kind
of
explanation.
and
here
there
wasn't
any
kind
of
gender
discrimination
of
any
kind,
according
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
therefore,
the
--
the
judge
in
this
case
was
not
authorized
to
even
ask
for
an
explanation.
but
the
explanation
given
by
defense
counsel
is
pretty
good.
mr.
james
k.
leven
well,
we
argue
that
the
judge
doesn't
have
sua
sponte
authority
to--
mr.
james
k.
leven
--well,
the
--
the
state
has
the
authority
to
have
some
regulation
of
preemptory
challenge
rights.
mr.
james
k.
leven
yes.
mr.
james
k.
leven
yes,
the
state
can
abolish
peremptory
challenges
if
it
wishes.
mr.
james
k.
leven
in
this
case,
though,
we
do
have
peremptory
challenges
created
by
the
state.
and,
your
honor,
i
request
that
i
--
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
my
rebuttal.
mr.
james
k.
leven
your
honor,
the
hicks
v.
oklahoma
case
is
a
very
important
case
as
far
as
the
due
process
right
to
a
lawful
adjudicator,
because
there
we
had
an
unlawful
sentencer.
so,
i
would
ask
that
the
court
consider
that.
that's
a
state
case
involving
an
unlawful
adjudicator.
so
we
do
have
a
due
process
violation
under
that
case.
as
to
the
sixth
amendment
issue,
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
act
inconsistently
with
the
sixth
amendment
as
far
as
its
manner
of
conducting
harmless
error
review,
because
harmless
error
analysis
is
impossible
to
conduct
in
this
situation,
because
in
order
to
do
that,
we
would
have
to
examine
what
the
particular
jury
would
have
done
had
it
not
been
for
the
error;
and
the
particular
jury
in
this
case
must
be
out,
because
there
the
particular
jury,
the
panel
as
a
whole,
is
illegally
constituted,
and
the
--
and
it's
impossible
to
conduct
your
harmless
error
analysis.
mr.
james
k.
leven
because
in
that
situation,
we
are
looking
at
what
the
particular
jury,
how
a
particular
jury
in
that
case
would
have
resolved
the
matter
had
the
erroneously
admitted
evidence
not
been
admitted.
mr.
james
k.
leven
whether
that
particular
jury
would
have
reached
the
same
verdict,
which
we
can't
do
in
this
case.
mr.
james
k.
leven
but
it
could
look
at
the
record
as
a
whole
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
--
the
particular
jury
that
rendered
the
verdict
would
have
done
the
same
thing
had
the
erroneously
admitted
evidence
not
--
not
been
--
not
been
introduced.
and
in
this
case,
we
have
a
very
different
situation.
we
have
an
illegal
adjudicator
and
we
can't
determine
whether
that
adjudicator
would
have
resolved
the
case
differently
had
it
not
been
for
the
error,
because
it's
impossible
to
assess
because
of
the
--
the
particular
adjudicator
that
resolved
this
case,
in
the
present
case,
was
illegally
composed.
