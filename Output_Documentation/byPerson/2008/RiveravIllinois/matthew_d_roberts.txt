mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
federal
law
does
not
require
automatic
reversal
of
petitioner's
conviction
because
the
denial
of
a
peremptory
challenge
at
most
violated
only
his
state
law
rights.
and
even
if
his
federal
constitutional
rights
had
been
violated,
harmless
error
review
would
apply.
the
constitution
does
not
give
criminal
defendants
the
right
to
peremptory
challenges.
therefore,
a
--
the
right
of
a
state
defendant
like
petitioner
to
exercise
peremptory
challenges
derives
entirely
from
state
law,
and
when
the
erroneous
denial
of
a
peremptory
challenge
deprives
him
only
of
state
law
right,
and
when
the
state
law
rights
alone
have
been
violated,
state
law,
not
federal
law,
dictates
whether
harmless
error
review
applies.
the
violation
of
a
state
law
right
doesn't
rise
to
a
due
process
--
federal
due
process
violation
unless
it
deprives
the
defendant
of
a
fair
trial.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
states
can
withhold
peremptory
challenges
entirely
without
impairing
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury
or
a
fair
trial.
it
therefore
follows
that
the
erroneous
denial
of
a
single
peremptory
challenge
does
not
render
a
trial
fundamentally
unfair.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
we'd
still
think
that
that
would
not
be
a
federal
constitutional
violation
and,
even
if
it
were
some
kind
of
a
federal
violation,
that
it
would
be
subject
to
review
for
harmlessness.
if
--
the
trial
court
could
violate
due
process,
if
its
actions
so
skewed
the
balance
of
power
over
the
selection
of
the
jury
in
favor
of
the
government
that
it
resulted
in
a
fundamentally
unfair
trial,
but
even
the
denial
of
multiple
peremptory
challenges
wouldn't
rise
to
that
level,
and
certainly
the
denial
of
a
single
one--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
question
there
would
be
whether
that
so
skews
--
the
test
that
i
said
before.
i
think
the
question
would
be
does
that
so
skew
the
balance--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
the
answer
is
clear
at
all.
the
state
might
rationally
conclude
that,
because
the
government
has
to
prove
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
because
it
has
to
convince
the
jurors
unanimously
to
rule
in
its
favor,
and
because
it
has
no
right
to
appeal
an
unfavorable
determination
by
the
jury,
that
the
prosecution
should
be
entitled
to
more
peremptory
challenges.
of
course,
this
case
doesn't--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it's
unlikely
to,
but--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
we
don't
think
that
it's
unconstitutional
at
all,
your
honor,
but
it
is
contrary
to
what
the
common
practice
and
the
way
things
have
been
approached
in
both
federal
and
state
courts.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
i
think
that
rests
on
the
mistaken
premise
that
harmless
error
analysis
turns
on
the
predilections
of
the
particular
decisionmaker
or
on
speculation
about
what
one
juror,
what
one
particular
juror
would
have
done
differently
than
another.
in
fact,
harmless
error
--
the
harmless
error
inquiry
looks
at
the
hypothetical
objective
rational
juror.
and
so,
that's
what
you
look
at
and
the
difference
between--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--but
--
but
that
is
not
an
appropriate
part
of
--
of
harmless
error
analysis,
just
like
the
fact
that
the
jury
might
engage
in
nullification
isn't
an
appropriate
part
of
the
harmless
error
analysis.
if
--
and
strickland
is
the
best
case
to,
i
think,
to
explain
how
that
is
irrelevant
to
the
inquiry,
even
though
it's
part
of
the
constitutional
there
--
analysis
there.
the
court
very
clearly
explains
that
you
don't
look
at
the
particular
decisionmaker,
you
don't
speculate
about
nullification,
about
arbitrary
action
and
the
like;
it's
sort
of
transferable
over.
that's
just
not
an
appropriate
part
of
harmless
error
analysis.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
we
think
that
the
correct
inquiry
in
this
circumstance,
given
the
nature
of
the
right,
is
to
ask
whether
the
error
resulted
in
the
seating
of
a
juror
that
was
not
impartial.
and
then
you
look
at
the
record
in
the
case,
the
voir
dire
record,
and
you
make
that
determination,
and
the
government
bears
the
--
bears
the
burden
of
proof.
so
we
don't
think
that
that
would
be
difficult
to
do,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
--
that
--
that
could
be,
but--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
i
think
we
are
respecting
its
fundamental
--
its
fundamental
purpose,
your
honor,
which
is
to
assist
to
help
achieve
the
goal
of
selecting
an
impartial
juror.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
generally
for
errors
like
the
error
you
described
before,
where
the
judge
erroneously
--
mistakenly
excuses
a
juror
in
the
belief
that
the
juror
is
disqualified
for
cause,
where
the
judge
mistakenly
substitutes
a
qualified
alternate
for
one
of
the
jurors,
or
the
judge
places
one
alternate
on
the
jury
instead
of
another,
the
courts
have
generally
looked
at
that
for
harmlessness
and
not
required
automatic
reversal.
indeed,
even
in
the
case
of
jurors
that
don't
satisfy--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
and
even
in
the
case
of
jurors
that
don't
meet
the
statutory
requirements,
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
unless
a
biased
juror
sits
a
new
trial
is
not
required.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
harmless
error
analysis,
there
are
sort
of
a
lot
of
different
scenarios
of
types
of
violations,
and
the
standard
that
they
use
is
not
clear
in
all
of
them.
in
the
ones
that
--
the
cases
that
i
found
that
involve
the
seating
of
jurors
that
don't
meet
the
federal
statutory
requirements,
usually
they
involve
felons
that
didn't
reveal
that
they
were
felons,
the
courts
have
looked
to
the
biased
juror
standard.
some
courts
have
done
that.
others
have
looked
to
whether
it
affects
the
verdict.
they
haven't
been
exactly
clear
how
you
--
how
you
determine
that,
but--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
even
if
you
had
a
standard
that
said
to
look
to
whether
there
was
an
effect
on
the
verdict,
you
could
tell
precisely
the
way
the
illinois
supreme
court
applied
neder
here.
if
no
rational
jury
could
have
acquitted,
then
you
know
the
substitution
of
one
rational,
impartial
juror
for
another
didn't
have
an
effect
on
the
outcome.
and
that
doesn't
violate
the
sixth
amendment
to
do
that,
your
honor,
because
the
underlying
right
--
the
underlying
error
doesn't
violate
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor.
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out
before,
the
petitioner
here
got
a
determination
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
every
element
of
the
offense
from
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
that
was
properly
instructed.
so
we
are
not
having
a
judge
substitute
that
at
all.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
is
true.
but
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
give
the
defendant
the
right
to
any
particular
jury.
it
doesn't
give
the
defendant
the
right
to
a
jury
that
has
been
selected
in
compliance
with
every
jot
and
tittle
of
state
law.
and
therefore
if
the
underlying
error,
as
the
underlying
error
here
where
you
get
a
denial
of
a
peremptory,
where
a
juror
is
seated
that,
even
though
that
violated
state
law
assumably
here,
that
--
that
that
doesn't
amount
to
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
and
if
the
--
if
the
defendant
got
his
sixth
amendment
rights
at
trial,
then
the
way
you
conduct
harmless
error
review
can't
violate
his
sixth
amendment
rights.
he
already
got
them.
and
so
it
can
be
done
and
it
doesn't
violate
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
i
--
we
would
obviously
like
to
have
sort
of
alternative
rulings
that
do
both,
but
i
think
the
most
logical
way
to
approach
the
case
is
to
decide
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution
here
and,
because
there
wasn't
one,
to
say
that
state
law
governs
the
harmless
error
analysis.
