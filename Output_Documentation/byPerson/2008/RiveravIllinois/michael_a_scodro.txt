mr.
michael
a.
scodro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
due
process
violation
here
and
that
takes
care
of
this
case
at
the
threshold.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
justice
scalia,
the
briefs
before
the
illinois
supreme
court
raise
two
independent
grounds
for
automatic
reversal
by
petitioner.
one
was
a
pure
state
law
automatic
reversal
rule.
the
other
was
a
due
process
violation
that
would
then
trigger
federal
automatic
reversal
requirements.
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
explicitly
is
say,
even
if
there
were
a
due
process
violation
here,
we
believe
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
would
not
trigger
automatic
reversal.
what's
certainly
implied,
because
several
of
the
questions
today
have
suggested,
what
is
implied
is
that
if
the
court
had
believed
that
as
a
matter
of
illinois
law
there
were
an
automatic
reversal
rule
required,
that
this
was
an
unlawful
juror
to
the
extended
so
profound
that
it
voided
the
judgment
and
required
a
new
trial,
under
those
circumstances
the
court
would
never
have
had
to
reach
that
assumption,
much
less
go
into
any
of
the
analysis
it
did.
so
here
the
court
was
faced
with
both
claims,
rejected
both,
but
to
reach
the
federal
claim
they
must
first
show
a
due
process
violation.
and
that's
what
they
failed
to
do
here.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
the
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
if
the
court
had
said,
we
are
going
to
lockstep
our
federal
--
or,
rather,
our
state
harmless
error
analysis
with
the
federal
question,
federal
analysis,
and
whatever
they
say
goes,
then
i
would
agree
that
under
those
circumstances
this
court
could
review
that
and
say,
you
got
that
wrong.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
i
can't
say
michigan
v.
long.
excellent
question,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
think
that
--
let
me
--
let
me--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
oh,
i
don't
think
they
did.
i
was
suggesting--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--we
think
they
analyzed
it
absolutely
correctly,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
right.
i
should
say
if
the
court
--
if
the
--
if
the
illinois
court
wanted
to
back
away
from
federal
law
at
any
point,
they
could
certainly
do
so.
and
so
even
if
this
court
were
to
say,
you
got
it
wrong
federally,
they
could
of
course
at
that
point
say,
no,
we
--
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
we
are
going
to
apply
a
brack
standard
or
a
chapman
standard.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
that
is
not--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--it
is
not
clear,
your
honor.
in
response
to
an
earlier
question,
they
cited
gomez.
and
they
--
and
there
is
a
line
of
cases
including
gomez
that
are
cited
in
their
brief.
those
are
federal
supervisory
authority
cases
in
which
the
court
has
said,
not
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
interpreting
the
federal
statute,
in
that
case
the
magistrate's
act,
to
conclude
that--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--correct.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
right.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
it
is
not
--
that
is
not
a
due
process
violation.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
i
don't
believe--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
i
don't,
your
honor.
i
think
the
federal
question,
if
there
is
one
presented,
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
threshold
due
process
violation.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
your
honor,
i
think
in
this
case
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
is
they
concluded--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--your
honor,
let
me
be
clear.
what
they
did
here
is
they
assumed
the
federal
constitutional
violation
because
they
recognized
that
there
was
no
state
entitlement
to
a
new
trial
under
these
circumstances.
so
they
then
said,
well--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--obviously,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
there
is
no
due
process
violation,
it
would
be
an
artificial
exercise
to
then
embark
on
an
analysis
of
a
proper
harmless
errors.
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
that
there
is
a
close
link
between
the
alleged
due
process
or
sixth
amendment
violation
and
the
manner
in
which
the
due
process
--
the
harmless
error
analysis
is
conducted.
in
gonzalez-lopez
that
was
the
gist
of
much
of
the
debate
between
the
majority
of
the--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--i--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--well,
two
points,
your
honor.
first,
in
context
with
the
briefs,
which
independently
sought
both
state
and
federal
remand,
and
page
171
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
the
court
makes
clear
that
we
are
simply
not
going
to
resolve
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
federal
due
process
violation,
i
think
in
context
it
does
become
clear
what
the
court
has
done
here
is
it
has
certainly
concluded
there
is
not
a
state
right.
so
it's
proceeded
to
say,
well,
what
if
there
is
a
federal
due
process
entitlement?
if
that
is
the
case,
let's
proceed
and
decide,
well,
it's
harmless
anyway.
we
don't
need
to
then
reverse
this
conviction.
now,
i
will
say
that
if
the
court
harbors
concerns
--
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
there
is
no
due
process
violation
here,
but
harbors
concerns
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
feels
itself
duty-bound
to
follow
this
court's
jurisprudence
on
the
question
of
harmlessness,
that
at
that
point
the
court
could
simply
make
the
due
process
ruling
and
remand
and
allow
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
make
clear
what
i
think
is
already
clear,
but
make
crystal
clear,
that
they
would
apply
a
--
a
harmless
error
standard
to
this
sort
--
this
sort
of
deprivation.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
they
have
done
is
they've
just
put
the
statement--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--they
have
run
the
analysis,
and
what
they
have
done,
your
honor,
is
said,
look,
any
error
here
of
constitutional
dimension
would
be
harmless.
therefore,
we
inform
the
reader
on
page
171,
we
simply
haven't
reached
the
question.
please
don't
read
the
foregoing
analysis
to
suggest
that
we
have
made
a
prior
conclusion
that
there
is
indeed
a
due
process
violation
here.
indeed,
the
court
suggests
there
probably
isn't
by
early
on
in
the
opinion
pointing
out
that
this
court
has
long
held
since
--
since
stilson
in
1919,
has
long
held
that
there
is
no
due
process
entitlement
to
a
peremptory
challenge.
so
i
think
in
context
it
is
quite
clear
that
what
the
court
has
done
is
it
said,
there
is
nothing
in
here
for
you
under
illinois
law;
under
federal
law,
even
if
there
were
a
due
process
violation,
it
is
simply
not
--
it
is
simply
harmless
error.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
your
honor,
we
would
have
no
objection
to
that
procedure,
but
i
would
caution
that
it
seems
unnecessary
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
parties
so
clearly
sought
relief
under
both
state
and
federal
law
and
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
--
the
illinois
supreme
court
concludes
it
doesn't
need
to
reach,
the
way
it
analyzes
the
--
the
constitutional
question.
i
think
that
--
and
the
underlying
assumption
that
judges
understand,
i
think
it's
fair
to
assume
that
the
illinois
justices
understood
that
they
could
go
further
as
a
matter
of
state
law
than
federal,
but
not
--
they
couldn't
provide
fewer
protections.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
well--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--i
should
begin
by
saying
that
the
gomez
and
wingo
and
nguyen
decisions
and
others
they
cite
in
that
line
for
the
non-article
iii
judge
proposition
are
themselves
not
due
process
decisions,
but
are
conclusions
as
a
matter
of
state
--
of
federal
law,
rather,
the
idea
being
that
congress
simply
hadn't
delegated
the
authority
properly
in
those
cases.
they
are
not
due
process
cases.
but
if
one
were
to
assume
that
those
would
also
be
due
process
violations,
to
have
a
non-article
iii
judge
sit,
i
would
distinguish
those
cases
at
that
point
hypothetically
by
saying
there
is
a
profound,
profound
difference
between
someone
who
lacks
any
and
all
mantle
of
state
authority,
on
the
one
hand,
and
a
juror
who
is
properly
sworn
and
who
satisfies
all
the
statutory
requirements
for
sitting
as
a
matter
of
illinois
law.
and
i
should
note,
in
the
reply
brief
there's
a
point
at
which
they
contend--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--again,
your
honor,
the
fundamental
--
the
lodestar
analysis
here
in
the
due
process
--
in
butte
v.
illinois,
the
court
said
they've
not
defined
it
with
precision,
but
it
has
always
been
fundamental
fairness,
a
community
sense
of
fair
play
and
decency.
it
seems
to
me
that,
as
you
move
into
a
judge
with
absolutely
no
mantle
of
state
authority
or
--
and
--
whatsoever,
versus
a
juror
who
is
properly
sworn,
properly
instructed,
but
who
nevertheless
sits
from
a
different
neighboring
jurisdiction
--
and
i
should
note
that
in
cook
county
there
are
three
jury
jurisdictions,
so
the
errors
could
be
legion
just
within
cook
county
in
terms
of
being
from
the
wrong
part
of
the
county.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
sort
of
error
simply
doesn't
come
anywhere
close
to
the
fundamental
fairness--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--this
is
true,
your
honor,
but
in
those
contexts,
the
very
state
law
that
has
created
those
divisions,
for
whatever
reason
they
have
seen
fit
to
do
so,
is
the
proper
authority
to
conclude
whether
or
not
the
error
is
so
profound
by
having
that
person
sit
that
it
ought
not
be
a
violation
of
due
process
--
that
it
ought
not
be
--
that
it
oughtn't
be
a
void
judgment.
indeed,
that's
how
these
federal
cases,
gomez
and
the
others--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--if
the
juror
is
biased,
yes,
but
not
if
the
juror
is
unbiased.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
it's
my
understanding
--
i
don't
believe
--
i
don't
have
cases
to
cite
on
this.
but
i
don't
believe
there
would
be
a
remedy
because
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
that
the
preemptory
right
and
those
surrounding
it
do
not
create
a
right
to
any
particular
juror.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
your
honor,
i
thought
you
were
asking
what
happens
if
a
particular
juror
the
defendant
wanted
did
not
sit,
and
under
those
circumstances
i
would
say
that
because
this
court
has
held--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--if
your
question
--
that
indicates
really
the
split
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
the
indirect
split
that
was
--
all
of
which
was
laid
out
in
the
cert
petition.
there
is
--
there
is
disagreement,
though
we
would
note
that
much
of
the
disagreement
--
some
of
it
--
is
pre-martinez-salazar
and
footnote
4
with
its
remarks
about
swain.
some
of
it
is
federal,
and
therefore
you
don't
have
the
same
concern
about
a
threshold
due
process
violation.
i
will
say,
to
answer
your
original
question,
though,
as
well
about
jurors
who
should
not
have
sat,
but
are
not
deemed
biased,
illinois
certainly
has
a
history
of
cases
to
that
effect,
and
the
court
--
the
illinois
court
has
handled
them
as
a
matter
of
illinois
law.
in
the
case
in
1886,
an
alien
sat
and
the
court
concluded
there
was
no
timely
objection.
that
was
part
of
its
analysis,
but
it
certainly
was
not
a
"nullity",
in
the
court's
words,
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
this
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs,
so
i'm
only
citing
it
in
response
to
a
question.
it's
a
case
called
chase
from
the
illinois
supreme
court--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--in
1886.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
your
honor.
and
indeed,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
cook
county
has
several
substantive
divisions,
so
that,
for
example,
a
criminal
law
division
judge
is
not
authorized
to
sit
on
a
family
law
matter,
for
example.
and
yet
illinois
law
has
made
clear
that
if
there's
an
error,
if
you
go
to
the
wrong
court
--
and
that
is
unlikely
to
happen
in
the
scenario
i
put
forth,
but
it
could
easily
happen
between
law
and
chancery
for
example,
and
does
indeed
happen.
if
that
were
be
the
case,
the
--
any
error
in
going
to
the
wrong
court
and
having
the
wrong
court
resolve
your
issue
does
not
void
the
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
i
certainly
don't
think
that
would
implicate
due
process
concerns
as
well.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
you
affirm
the
judgment
below.
