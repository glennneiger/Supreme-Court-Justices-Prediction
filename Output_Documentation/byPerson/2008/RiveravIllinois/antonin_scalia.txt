justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
need
a
good
reason
for
a
peremptory
challenge.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
whole
fun
of
a
peremptory
challenge:
you
don't
need
a
good
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
and
for
some
reason,
i
just
think
this
person
is
not
going
to
vote
for
me.
i
don't
know
why.
i
just
don't
think
so.
i
don't
want
this
person
sitting
on
the
jury.
that's
all
the
reason
you
need.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
the
authority
to
abolish
peremptory
challenge
rights
entirely,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
is
not
a
hard
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
therefore,
it
could
take
the
much
lesser
step
of
allowing
the
trial
judge,
if
he
has
any
suspicion
that
a
peremptory-challenge
right
is
being
used
in
violation
of
batson,
to
disallow
it.
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
does
it
really?
suppose
i
agree
with
you
that
there
is
--
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
violation.
but
i
also
think
that
in
assessing
the
consequence
of
a
state
law
violation
the
illinois
court
here
was
looking
to
federal
law
and
was
trying
to
apply
the
federal
law
of
harmless
error.
if
that's
the
situation,
would
we
not
have
the
obligation
to
determine,
or
would
we
have
the
obligation
to
determine,
whether
it
was
properly
applying
the
federal
law
of
harmless
error?
even
though
it
didn't
have
to,
it
chose
to
use
the
federal
law
of
harmless
error
to
--
to
apply
to
this
state
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
illinois
supreme
court
can
happily
go
along
blaming
everything
on
us,
so
when
it
stands
for
reelection
it
can
say,
well,
we
are
just
applying
federal
law.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
that's
the
consequence
of
your
answer
to
that
question.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
the
disposition
that
where
a
state
court,
even
in
resolving
a
state
law
question,
uses
a
federal
principle,
adverts
specifically
to
federal
law,
cites
federal
cases,
it
would
cover
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
certainly
agree
that
if
the
only
reason
the
illinois
supreme
court
used
the
federal
harmless
error
rule
was
because
it
was
assuming
a
federal
constitutional
violation,
once
we
reject
that
assumption,
the
whole
thing
drops
out.
but
is
that
entirely
clear
from
the
opinion?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clear
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
wouldn't
have
used
the
same
test
under
simply
illinois
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
is
the
--
the
only
reason
the
illinois
supreme
court
found
that
there
was
no
error
of
constitutional
dimension,
meaning
federal
constitutional
dimension,
the
only
reason
it
--
it
found
that
is
because
it
found
that
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
the
cart
before
the
horse.
