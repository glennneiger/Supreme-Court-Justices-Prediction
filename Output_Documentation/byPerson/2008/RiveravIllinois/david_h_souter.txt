justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
your
whole
argument
that
the
--
that
the
juror
was
illegally
sitting
and
the
jury
was
illegally
constituted
is
a
--
in
effect
a
statement
of
the
effect
of
state
law.
and
the
state
supreme
court
doesn't
think
that's
the
effect
under
state
law.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
the
whole
premise
of
your
argument
that
there
is
something
inherently
unlawful
about
the
seating
of
that
juror
is
simply
in
--
in
effect
denied
by
the
state
supreme
court.
and
we
take
our
law
from
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
--
you
in
effect
are
saying
that
any
violation
of
state
law
with
respect,
let's
say,
to
criminal
trial
procedure
becomes,
if
not
remedied,
a
due
process
violation
under
federal
law.
that's
--
that's
your
--
your
unstated
premise,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
goes
back
to
the
point
which
you
rejected
when
i
suggested
--
i
suggested
earlier
that
you
were
in
effect
arguing
that
every
violation
of
a
state
statute
in
this
criminal
context
amounted
to
a
due
process
violation.
and
you
say,
no,
that's
not
what
i
am
arguing.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
exactly
what
you
just
said
to
justice
ginsburg.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
were
talking
about
peremptory
challenges
before
and
we
are
talking
about
peremptory
challenges
now.
have
you
changed
your
position
from
--
from
the
position
you
stated
in
answer
to
my
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
look,
the
question
that
i
thought
i
was
asking
and
i
thought
you
were
answering
was
this:
do
you
claim
that
every
violation
of
state
law
in
the
--
we'll
say
in
the
selection
of
jurors
--
is
--
is
automatically,
if
not
remedied
by
the
state,
a
federal
due
process
violation?
and
you
said,
if
i
recall
correctly,
no.
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
answering
justice
ginsburg's
question
just
now
you
were
saying
yes.
you
said
the
state
has
to
act
consistently
with
due
process.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
--
so,
do
you
stand
by
the
answer
you
gave
me
or
is
it
in
fact
now
your
position
that
every
violation
of
state
law
that
goes
unremedied
becomes
a
federal
due
process
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then
why
does
this
one
become
a
due
process
violation
if
it's
unremedied.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that
--
that
then
goes
back
to
an
earlier
question.
it's
an
unlawful
adjudicator
if
state
law
says
so.
federal
law
says
you
don't
even
have
to
have
peremptory
challenges,
you
don't
even
have
to
have
a
process
for
winnowing
out
the
gomez
jurors.
so,
in
effect,
if
you
are
saying
that
there
is
something
unlawful
about
the
seating
of
the
juror,
you
are
making
a
statement
of
state
law,
and
the
state
supreme
court
disagrees
with
you,
which
seems
to
me
to
foreclose
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
did
not
find
anything
unlawful
about
the
juror
sitting.
they
said,
yeah,
the
perempt
should
have
been
--
the
peremptory
challenge
should
have
been
respected.
but
they
did
not
say,
and
it
seems
to
me
they
clearly
rejected
the
notion,
that
there
was
something
unlawful
about
the
jury
and
unlawful
about
that
juror's
participating
in
reaching
a
verdict;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no.
the
--
the
peremptory
challenge
should
have
been
respected.
but
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
say,
as
i
understand
it,
that
by
allowing
the
juror
to
sit
the
juror
was
acting
in
an
unlawful
capacity
or
that
there
was
something
unlawful
under
state
law
about
the
jury's
action
and
the
jury's
verdict.
am
i
not
correct
about
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
they
thought
that
tainted
everything
that
happened
afterwards,
it
seems
to
me
they
would
have
said,
therefore,
the
verdict
is
no
good.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
it
had
everything
to
do,
it
seems
to
me,
with
the
issue
of
state
law.
regardless
of
whether
they
applied
or
misapplied
a
precedent
of
ours
respect
--
with
respect
to
federal
constitutional
law,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
to
have
meant
it
was
okay
so
far
as
the
validity
of
the
verdict
is
concerned
for
this
person
to
participate.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
ultimately,
there
was
--
there
was
no
error
under
state
law
that
needed
to
be
corrected?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
so
far
as
the
ultimate
jury
verdict
was
concerned,
the
illinois
supreme
court,
i
understand
it
to
have
said,
was
there
is
no
error
that
needs
to
be
corrected
under
state
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
didn't
they
correct
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
--
in
other
words,
you
read
the
--
the
--
the
illinois
supreme
court
as
to
say,
this
is
a
violation
of
our
statutes
and
constitution,
a
violation
that
would
--
would
entitle
this
person
to
have
the
--
the
verdict
set
aside
and
a
new
trial,
but
because
the
federal
practice,
applying
federal
constitutional
law,
is
to
engage
in
harmless
error
analysis,
we
won't
correct
our
state
law
error
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
--
and
we
will
in
fact
apply
a
harmless
error
analysis
that
otherwise
wouldn't
apply
because
it's
federal,
and
on
that
ground
we
will
let
the
verdict
stand.
is
that
the
way
you
read
the
illinois
supreme
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
well,
that's
what
batson
says
has
to
be
done
in
order
to
justify
the
strike.
when
--
but
is
there
any
reason
why
a
state
couldn't
go
further
to
guard
against
discrimination
in
the
use
of
peremptories?
