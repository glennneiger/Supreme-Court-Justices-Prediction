justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
could
be
a
thousand
reasons
why
under
state
law
a
particular
jury
is
improperly
constituted.
so
you
are
saying
whenever
the
state
under
whatever
state
laws
it
has
says
that
the
judge
made
a
mistake
about
who
to
put
on
the
jury,
that
that
violates
the
federal
constitution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why?
one
qualification
is
a
jury
--
a
juror
can't
be
prejudiced.
all
right.
i
think
it's
a
very
common
thing
for
prosecutors
and
defense
lawyers
to
get
into
arguments
about
whether
a
particular
juror
is
or
is
not
prejudiced.
okay.
so
sometimes
the
judge
excuses
them,
maybe
five
million
times
a
year;
and
probably
in
a
certain
percentage,
maybe
5,000
or
500
or
50,000,
the
judge
is
wrong.
so
the
state
appellate
court
says
he's
wrong.
so
the
jury
wasn't
made
up
properly.
now
you
are
saying
in
every
one
of
those
cases
that
violates
the
federal
constitution.
i
have
never
heard
of
this
before.
it
may
be
there
is
some
precedent
for
it.
i
don't
know.
that's
why
i
am
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
means
that
held
--
we
have
held
in
that
case
--
i
had
better
look
at
it
--
that
in
any
instance
where
excusing
a
juror
violates
state
law
that
that
is
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution?
which
is
the
case
that
says
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
did
they
get
it
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
you
say
they
got
it
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
that
mean
even
if
it
were
federal?
i
don't
know.
i'm
asking.
again,
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
clear
as
a
matter
--
i
don't
know.
again,
i'm
asking.
is
it
clear
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
we
have
lots
of
federal
trials,
and
in
a
federal
trial
where
a
district
judge
makes
an
error
in
excusing
a
juror
--
he
shouldn't
have
excused
the
juror,
there
are
many,
many
reasons
for
doing
it,
so
the
jury
is
not
properly
as
the
defense
lawyer
had
the
right
to
have
it
--
that
that
requires
automatically
a
new
trial?
is
that
clear
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
or
not?
and
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
don't
know
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
am
not
talking
about
magistrates,
and
i'm
not
talking
about
due
process.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
am
asking
the
question,
just
what
i
asked.
now,
you
heard
what
i
asked.
it's
about
jurors.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
what
is
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
i'm
not
asking
that
question.
i
am
asking,
when
a
lawyer
--
when
a
--
when
a
judge
makes
a
mistake
and
excuses
a
juror
whom
he
shouldn't
have
excused
because
he
thought
the
juror
was
prejudiced,
say,
and
he
wasn't,
the
appeals
court
says,
you
are
wrong
about
excusing
him,
does
under
federal
law
the
defendant
become
entitled
to
a
new
trial?
not
under
the
constitution;
under
whatever
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
the
answer
is
no,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
--
that's
exactly
what
i
can't
figure
out.
i'm
trying
--
forget
due
process.
all
right?
keep
that
out
of
your
mind.
we
have
approximately
50
state
jurisdictions,
the
district
of
columbia,
a
bunch
of
federal
jurisdictions.
in
those
jurisdictions,
to
your
knowledge
--
you
may
not
know
this,
you
may
not
have
looked
it
up
--
but
what
happens
in
the
situation
where
a
juror
--
where
a
juror
should
have
been
excused?
i
guess
there's
a
new
trial.
the
juror
should
have
been
excused,
but
wasn't.
i
guess
there's
a
new
trial
normally;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
juror
is
biased,
yes.
okay.
now,
suppose
it's
the
defendant
who
wanted
the
juror
and
he
was
--
he
was
wrongly
excused.
all
right,
so
that's
what
the
appeals
court
holds.
what's
the
rule?
again,
do
they
go
back
and
look
and
see
if
it's
biased?
if
the
juror
--
if
the
defendant
didn't
get
the
juror
he
wanted,
somebody
else
took
his
place,
so
they
look
to
see
if
that
person
was
biased,
and
if
not,
say:
too
bad,
defendant;
you
may
have
been
right,
but
you
lost
the
jury
that
you
want,
no
remedy?
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
at
least
in
the
case
of
where
he
failed
to
get
a
peremptory,
whether
it's
federal
or
whether
it's
state,
the
federal
law
and
most
state
law
is:
you
lost
your
right
to
a
peremptory,
one
of
them.
you
should
have
had
it,
but
you
are
out
of
luck,
if
--
if
the
juror
who
replaced,
the
replacement,
the
juror
who
was
there,
you
know,
who
otherwise
wouldn't
have
been,
is
a
fair
juror.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
the
last
situation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
law
there?
that's
what
i
have
been
trying
to
get
at.
i
mean,
my
initial
instinct
would
be
that
if
a
defendant
doesn't
get
the
jury
that
the
law
entitles
him
to,
that's
an
error.
and
you'd
normally
think
it
was
harmful,
because
you
can't
say,
in
honesty,
that
it
was
harmless;
it's
the
jury
that
was
supposed
to
decide.
i
expect
it
would
work
out
that
way.
i
have
never
looked
into
it.
how
has
it
worked
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
--
all
right.
so
in
other
words,
they
have
often
said
you
don't
get
a
new
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
