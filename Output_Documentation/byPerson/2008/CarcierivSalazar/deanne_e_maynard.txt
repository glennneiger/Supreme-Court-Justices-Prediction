ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
text
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
supports
the
secretary's
action
here
for
three
independent
reasons.
first,
section
5
authorizes
the
secretary
to
take
land
into
trust
for
any
indian
tribe,
and
the
narragansett
tribe
is
a
tribe
as
that
term
is
separately
defined
in
the
act.
second,
even
if
one
looks
to
the
definition
of
19,
the
best
reading
of
"now"
in
the
first
definitional
example
is
at
the
time
that
the
act
is
applied.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
colloquy,
it
--
it
only
makes
sense,
the
addition
of
"now
under
federal
jurisdiction",
if
what
they
meant
by
that
was
to
use
it
at
the
time
the
act
is
invoked.
senator
wheeler's
concern,
as
mr.
olson
explained,
was
that
there
were
indians
in
california
who
were
then--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--ironically,
your
honor,
i
think
the
congress
added
the
term
"now
under
federal
jurisdiction"
to
the
act,
yes,
to
make
clear
that
it
--
it
was
a
contemporaneous
application
of
the
term.
senator
wheeler
was
concerned
about
indians
who
were
already
under
federal
jurisdiction,
and
he
said
sooner
or
later
they
must
have
come
out
from
under
the
act.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
the
colloquy
is
certainly
not
clear,
justice
breyer.
i'll
grant
you
that.
but
i
do
think
the
best
reading--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
--
i
think
the
best
reading
of
it
is
that
commissioner
collier
is
addressing
senator
wheeler's
concern,
not
the
earlier
concern
about
the
catawbas,
because
he
says
"senator
wheeler"
--
"senator
wheeler,
will
this
not
address
your
concern?
"
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
my
memory
of
it--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--my
memory
is
that
it
was
a
different
senator
who
was
concerned
about
the
catawbas.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
i
think
it
was
at
a
hearing,
your
honor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
but
if
i
could,
going
back
to
the
text,
justice
scalia,
the
text
of
the
act
independently
support
the
secretary's
reading
for
three
reasons,
the
third
being
that
even
if
one
reads
18,
1934,
the
definition
by
its
terms
is
expressly
inclusive,
setting
forth
the
category
of
people
that
the
secretary
must
include
but
not
limiting
the
secretary
to--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
think
that
would
be
a
more--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
think
the
proper
way
of
reading,
as
this
court
said,
definitions
that
start
with
"shall
include"
is
that
they
are
illustrative
examples
of
a
general
group.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor;
i
think
an
illustrative
example
of
a
general
class,
it
would
be
persons
listed
like
the
listed
person.
you
example
of
the
quarter
blood
would
be
more
difficult,
perhaps.
but
here
what
the
secretary
has
done
is
include
within
the
meaning
of
1934.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
it
doesn't
do
that,
your
honor.
i
think
both
--
both
the
definitions
of
--
of
mr.
olson
suggests.
you
can't
take
the
word
"indian"
everywhere
it
appears
in
the
statute
and
plug
in
the
definition
of
"indian".
and
that's
proven
by
looking
at
the
definition
of
"indian"
itself,
which
uses
the
adjective
"indian"
to
define
the
term
"indian"
four
times.
so
you
can't
take--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
straightforward
reading
of
that
would
be
any
descendant
who
meet
the
terms
of
that
provision
would
be
included.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the
descendants.
yes,
we
interpret
that
to
be
descendants
who
were
living
on
the
reservation
on
june
1,
1934,
but
they
wouldn't
even
have
to
be
members
of
tribes,
and
there
would
be
no
blood
quantum
requirement.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
descendants
who
were
on
june
1st,
1934.
that's
not
using
--
that's
not
applying
the
definition
of
the
word
"now".
that's
in
fact
using
a
very
different
phrase,
the
second
phrase,
where
congress
used
a
date
when
it
meant
a
date
in
1934--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--rather
than
the
definition
now.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
verbs
in
the
definitional
phrase,
all
of
them
are
"are",
"are",
"are":
"are
members
of
recognized
indian
tribes.
"
1st,
1934:
"who
were
on
june
1,
1934,
residing
on
a
reservation.
"
and
i
think
the
best
reading
of
mr.
olson
has
pointed
you
to
several
places
in
the
text
where
they
use
"now"
in
very
different
clauses:
"now
pending",
"now
or
hereafter"
--
and
--
but
in
two
places
in
the
act,
and
that's
why
i
do
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
act
itself,
justice
scalia,
because
this
hasn't
been
codified
into
positive
law.
in
two
places
in
the
act,
section
14
and
section
18,
congress
used
the
phrase
"at
the
time
of
passage
of
this
act.
"
so
it
knew
how
to
use
that
phrase.
it
didn't
use
that
phrase
in
"now".
and
in
fact
when
those--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
that's
obviously
dicta
in
the
context
of
the
decision,
but
i
think
in
fact
the
addition
of
the
brackets
shows
that
it's
ambiguous.
if
it
were
so
clear,
they
wouldn't
have
needed
to
add
the
phrase.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
the
court
wasn't
resolving
the
meaning
of
the
first
definition
in
john,
so
i
don't
think
the
court
was
resolving
anything.
but
i
do
think
if
it
had
been
so
clear,
the
court
wouldn't
have
needed
to
add
the
phrase.
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--it's
certainly
not
a
holding,
justice
scalia--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that
the
text
unambiguously
forecloses
any
other
reading.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
apart
from
the
collier
memo,
which
i
would
like
to
address,
the
secretary
when
administering
this
act
has
uniformly,
since
the
beginning,
applied
the
definition
that
applies
today.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
don't
know--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
don't
know
that
the
secretary
has
ever
undertaken
to
make
such
a
list.
there
was
no
list
at
the
time.
and
the
act
was
a
forward-looking
act
in
its
view
of
organized
tribes
and
by
its
nature
assumed
that
there
would
be
no
tribes.
but
in
the
1930s
and
1940s,
the
solicitor's
opinions
that
we
cite
and
discuss
in
our
brief
apply
the
question
of
whether
a
group
is
a
tribe
who
can
organize
under
section
16
or
can
have
land
taken
into
trust
for
them
under
section
5.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
my
understanding
is
that
the
secretary
interprets
"recognized"
and
"under
federal
jurisdiction"
to
not
have
much
difference
with
respect
to
tribes.
i
think
the
"under
federal
jurisdiction",
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
this
might
have
more
content
when
you're
talking
about
individuals,
and
that
makes
more
sense--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--and
possibly
you
could.
i
don't
know
that
that
would
help
the
narragansett
tribe
here.
but
the
secretary
has
always
looked
at
whether
--
whether
a
tribe
could
reorganize
or
have
land
taken
into
trust
for
them
under
section
16
and
section
5,
to
which
the
same
definitional
--
definitions
apply
as
to
whether
or
not
the
tribe
was
a
tribe
at
the
time
the
secretary
was
applying
that
decision.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
there
is
--
there
is
a
competing
presumption
there
that
i
think
is
--
chief
justice
roberts,
which
is
that
indian
statutes
are
interpreted
to
the
benefit
of
the
indian.
and
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
new
deal
for
the
indians--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
the
indians
are
the
ones
who
made
the
request
to
have
the
land
taken
into
trust.
and
i
assume
they
know
--
that
they
believe
it's
in
their
interest
to
have
the
land
taken
into
trust.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the
administrative
record
reveals
that
hud
loaned
the
--
or
granted
the
tribe
money
to
build
housing.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
according
to
the
administrative
record,
there
are
some
hud
restrictions
on
the
land.
if
what
you're
concerned
with
is
the
specter
of
gaming,
our
interpretation
of
the
indian
gaming
regulatory
act
is
that
the
tribe
could
not
unilaterally
decide
to
game
on
this
property
were
it
taken
into
trust.
but
as
to
your
point,
the
--
with
respect
to
the
clarity
of
these
definitions,
the
terms
1934
several
times.
in--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
you've
said--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--here
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
the
purpose
of
section
5
was
to
allow
the
secretary
to
take
land
into
trust
for
indians.
and
then--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
standing
here
and,
petitioners
haven't
cited
anything
for
that
principle
in
their
brief,
although
they
suggest
--
of
that.
there
is
a
competing
principle
that
indian
sovereignty
is
not
lightly
to
be
set
aside.
one
important
point
i
think
is
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
--
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
makes
more
sense.
the
--
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
a
forward-looking
one.
it
was
to
revitalize
and
reorganization
rights.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
the
historians
brief,
i
think,
makes
a
good
case
that
that's
not
the
right
view
of
history.
but
the
text
also
debunks
that
view.
the
half-blood
definition
is
in
no
way
limited
to
whether
or
not
you
were
an
indian
who
was
a
member
of
a
tribe
who
was
allotted.
the
inclusion
of
pueblos
also
makes
clear
that
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
act,
because
pueblos
never
had
their
lands
allotted.
this
was
a
new
deal
legislation
for
indians
to
let
them
revitalize.
it
was
the
beginning
of
what
now
has
consistently
been,
with
the
exception
of
the
1950s,
the
--
you
know,
congress
has
set
about
to
allow
the
indians
to
govern
themselves.
the
acquisition
of
land
is
extremely
important
to
the
ability
to
do
that,
to
revive
economically,
to
have
self-governance.
the
line
that
petitioners
pose
would
create
an
entirely
arbitrary
result.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
i
think,
as
i
was
saying
earlier,
i
think
the
colloquy
was
--
reveals
that
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
make
the
statute
fluid
so
that
it
would
apply
at
the
time
of
application
contemporaneous
move
with
the
times.
as
i
said
earlier,
i
don't
think
there
is
much
distinction
between
recognition
and
under
federal
jurisdiction
when
one
is
speaking
about
tribes,
but
perhaps--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i'm
not
certain
enough
to
say,
justice
souter.
i'm
not
sure
it
was
litigated
on
that
--
on
that
premise.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
mean,
you
know,
if
the
court
is
going
to
take
that
view
of
the
statute,
then
i
suppose
a
remand
is
preferable
to
let
it
be
worked
out.
but
the
secretary's
preface.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
you
know,
i
just
don't
know
that
it's
ever
been
looked
into
from
that
perspective,
especially
if
one
draws
the
difference--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
believe
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
from
the
beginning,
as
i
suggested
before,
has
--
has
understood
recognition
and
under
federal
jurisdiction
at
least
with
respect
to
tribes
to
be
one
and
the
same.
and
the
--
the
--
if
the
court
were
to
draw
a
distinction
and,
you
know
--
from
the
beginning
of
the
1930s
and
'40s
the
opinions
show
that
what
the
secretary
looked
at
was
at
the
fact
at
the
time
as
in
1964
there
were
published
regulations
interpreting
indians
and
tribe
not
limited
by--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--which
wasn't
worked
out?
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
i
think
there--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
if
the
court
limits
its
view
to
the
one
definitional
example
in
the
ira,
then
perhaps
a
remand
is
certainly
preferable
to
a
reversal.
but
there
is
no
need
to
remand,
because
there
are
two
separate
reasons.
for
the
petitioner's
to
prevail
here,
the
text
has
to
unambiguously
foreclose
the
possibility--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--even
if
you
think,
justice
breyer,
that
18,
1934,
there
are
two
other--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
i
think
that
one
--
if
one
can't
tell
from
the
text
in
chevron
and
other
principles,
that
you
allow
the
secretary,
in
light
of
his
understanding
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
the
plight
of
the
indians,
contemporaneous
things,
to
decide
what
the
statute
means.
but
there
are
two
other
provisions
in
the
statute
that,
apart
from
that,
the
other
side,
for
them
to
prevail,
the
statute
has
to
unambiguously
foreclose
the
taking
of
land
in
trust
for
tribes,
setting
apart
the
example
of
"indian".
and
the
definition
of
"tribe"
is,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
it's
separately
defined.
that--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
agree.
i
agree
wholeheartedly,
and
i
think
there
might
have
been
reasons
that
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
they
might
have
wanted
to
limit
the
definition
of
any
of
the
benefits
the
act
allows
individuals,
but
not
limit
the
act's
coverage
of
tribes.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
i
think
maybe
i
didn't--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
think
it
can
capture
tribes
that
were
previously
recognized
but
that
either
disband
or
become
--
become
not
--
not
vibrant.
but
in
terms
of
currently
recognized
tribes,
tribes
that
the
secretary
today
recognizes
as
tribes
that
have
always
been
tribes
--
and
that's
all
we
are
talking
about
here:
tribes
that
were
tribes
before
european
contact,
have
had
a
cohesive
political
entity
since
that
time.
and
that's
what
the
narragansetts
are.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
two
points,
justice
breyer.
there
is
nothing
in
the
definitional
section
that
requires
the
drafting
of
"indian"
on
to
the
definition
of
"tribe".
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
but
in--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--but
later
on
in
section
5
it
says
we
can
take
land
in
trust
on
behalf
of
an
indian
tribe
or
an
individual
indian
for
whom
the
land
is
required.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
we
have
to
graft
on
to
the
last
clause
where
--
indians
residing
on
a
reservation.
but
it
can't
graft
on
to
"indian
tribe",
justice
scalia,
because
"indian
tribe"
is
used
to
define
"indian",
as
well.
and
the
whole
thing
is
circular,
and
it--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--but
it
--
that
may
be
so
but
it
doesn't
unambiguously
foreclose
the
secretary's
interpretation
here.
and
that
must
mean
they
must
show
that
it
unambiguously
forecloses--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--this
court
had
interpreted--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--in
montoya
this
court
had
interpreted
in
an
earlier
statute
the
term
"indian
tribe"
and
"organized
band"
to
mean
a
distinctly
indian
community
that
shared
political,
ethnic,
and
cultural
attributes.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
but
the
definition
of
mr.
chief
justice.
that
can't
be
clear.
you
can't
take
their
--
their
plain-text
argument
where
you
just
take
the
word
anywhere.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes,
and
i
grant
you
that
it
may
graft
on
to
the
last
clause.
but
it
doesn't
graft
on
to
"indian
tribe,
organized
band,
or
pueblos.
"
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well
--
but
if
you
look
broadly
at
the
act,
justice
stevens,
there
are
provisions
that
are
meant
to
address
tribe
issues
and
tribal
issues.
and
--
and
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
--
it
makes
more
sense
to
read
"tribe"
as
--
as
not
limited
by
the
date
and
the
provisions
that
apply
to
"tribe",
which
is
how
the
secretary
has
always
read
it.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
as
we
--
i
discussed
earlier,
i
don't
agree
with
your
reading
of
the
colloquy.
i
do
think
it's
ambiguous.
i
think,
at
a
minimum,
the
statute
doesn't
foreclose
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
provisions.
and
1
clearly
is
not
the
19.
because
in
section
1
they
talk
about
indians
who
have
entered
into
treaties.
and
that
would
have
included
both
indians
who
were
and
were
not
under
section
--
under
--
would
meet
the
definition
of
19;
nor
would
plugging
that
definition
into
section
1
make
very
much
sense.
the
--
if
i
could,
just
before
time
runs
out
--
if
the
court
gets
to
the
second
question,
as
we
think
you
should,
the
--
the
settlement
act
clearly
does
not
repeal
the
secretary's
authority
to
take
land
into
trust.
and
if
the
court
has
any
questions
about
that,
it
addresses
jurisdiction
in
rhode
island
expressly
and
limits
rhode
island's
jurisdiction
to
the
settlement
land.
it
contemplates
that
the
secretary
may
some
day
take
land
into
trust
on
behalf
of
the
tribe.
other
acts,
similar
acts,
do
expressly
address
that
question.
unlike
the
rhode
island
act,
they
have
similar
extinguishment
premises,
and,
yet,
they
--
they
went
on.
i
just
--
the
rhode
island
extinguishment
provisions
just
don't
have
the
meaning
that
--
that
petitioners
say.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
they
could.
if
i
could
make
one
point
in
response
to
that?
congress
has
already
acted
on
the
presumption
that
the
secretary's
reading
is
correct.
in
ilca
section
2019
there
is
an
exception
--
it's
in
the
back
of
our
brief
on
page
30
--
igra;
sorry,
igra
--
page
35a
that
lands
taken
into
trust
as
part
of
an
initial
reservation
of
any
tribe
acknowledged
by
the
secretary
under
the
federal
acknowledgment
process.
in
other
words,
congress
understands
the
secretary
to
have
the
authority
to
take
land
in
a
trust
for
tribes
that
have
been
duly
recognized
under
the
secretary's
acknowledgment
process.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
in
the
ones
of
which
i'm
aware
i
think
just
to
make
it
clear
beyond
doubt
that
section
465
applies
to
tribes.
often
the
ones
that
i
know
of
just
have
a
list
of
statutes
and
say
these
are
--
now
apply
to
the
--
to
the
tribe.
in
--
in
other
acts
congress
has
acted;
in
fact
it's
amended
section
16
of
the
ira
in
1994.
and
there
has
been
decades
--
since
1964
the
secretary
has
interpreted
section
16
to
apply
to
any
recognized
indian
tribe;
and
congress
amended
it
to
add
authority
--
(f)
and
(g)
--
instruct
the
secretary
to
treat
all
recognized
tribes
the
same.
