justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
i
suppose
if
the
phrase
"now
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
"
did
not
have
any
clear
meaning
when
the
statute
was
enacted,
it
--
it
wouldn't
have
any
clear
meaning
for
the
future,
either.
so
you
don't
--
you
don't
solve
that
problem
by
reading
"now"
to
mean
"then",
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i'm
saying
it
doesn't
help
if
you
do
what
the
government
suggests.
that
doesn't
give
any
clearer
content
to
the
meaning
of
being
under
federal
jurisdiction.
it
is
still
going
to
have
to
be
worked
out
somehow.
the
question
is
whether
you
work
it
out
and
apply
it
as
of
the
time
of
the
statute
or
work
it
out
and
apply
it
time
by
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
--
where
were
you
reading
from?
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
what's
causing
me
confusion
there.
you're
talking
about
--
i
wish
we
would
just
use
the
statutory
numbers,
but
do
what
you
like.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
section
are
we
talking
about
--
19?
or
are
we
talking
about
some
other
number?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
you
think
"indian"
modifies
"organized
band"
and
"pueblo"
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
--
where
was
this
interesting
conversation?
was
it
even
on
the
floor
of
the
congress?
it
couldn't
have
been,
because
one
of
the
members
wasn't
a
congressman,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
at
a
hearing,
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can
include
anybody
else?
he
can
include,
for
example,
people
who
are
only
one
quarter-indian
blood,
even
though,
you
know,
they
went
to
the
trouble
of
defining
it
as
50
percent
indian
blood?
justice
antonin
scalia
very
strange
statute,
just
leaving
it
up
to
him
to
do
whatever
he
wants.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
there
is
no
limitations.
it
includes
this
and
it
also
includes
whatever
else
he
wants.
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
--
that's
a
very
strange
reading
of
"shall
include"
when
you're
dealing
with
a
word
that
does
not
itself
have
any
solid
content.
when
you're
dealing
with
a
word
that's
pretty
much
self-defining,
yes,
you
can
say
"shall
include
this",
because
what
in
addition
is
included
is
--
is
pretty
clear.
but
these
words
have
virtually
no
--
no
content;
and
if
you
say
"shall
include"
means,
you
know,
it
has
this,
i'm
still
left
with
well,
what
else
does
it
have?
i
can't
believe
that
the
statute
was
meant
to
be
that
expansive,
to
let
the
secretary
buy
land
for
whomever
he
wanted.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
pretty
clear
what
the
court
thought
it
meant,
though,
isn't
it?
whether
it's
dictum
or
not,
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
court
thought
it
clearly
enough
meant
that,
that
they
were
willing
to
say
bracket
--
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
suggests
that
it's
not
very
ambiguous,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
interested
--
i'm
interested
in
the
secretary's
conclusion
that
recognized
"tribe"
and
"tribe
now
under
federal
jurisdiction"
are
one
and
the
same;
that
the
words
are
used
redundantly.
does
he
know
the
rule
that
we
usually
don't
--
i
guess
he
doesn't
because
he
interprets
"now"
to
mean
nothing.
does
he
understand
that
we
usually
do
not
interpret
words
to
have
no
meaning?
why
would
they
say
both
if
they
both
mean
the
same
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
"recognized
tribe
under
federal
jurisdiction",
that,
to
me,
means
two
different
requirements.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
how
you
say
that
--
that
the
term
"tribe"
has
no
limitation
to
indians.
"the
term
"tribe",
whenever
used
in
this
act,
shall
be
construed
to
refer
to
any
indian
tribe,
organized
band
or
pueblo,
or
the
indians
residing
on
one
reservation.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
--
i
mean
circular
definitions
are
nothing
unusual
in
the
legislation
that
congress
comes
up
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
meaning
--
what
meaning
do
you
think
the
sentence
has
when
it
says:
"the
term
"tribe"
shall
be
construed
to
refer
to
any
indian
tribe,
organized
band,
pueblo,
or
the
indians
residing
on
one
reservation?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
interpret
that
not
to
be
limited
to
indian
tribes?
