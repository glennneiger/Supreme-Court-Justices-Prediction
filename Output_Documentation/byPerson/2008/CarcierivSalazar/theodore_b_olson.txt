mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
squarely
addressed
and
unambiguously
answered
the
first
question
in
this
case
when
it
enacted
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934.
it
authorized
the
secretary
to
take
land
in
trust
for
indians,
and
it
declared,
as
used
in
this
act,
indians
were
"members
of
any
recognized
indian
tribe
now
under
federal
jurisdiction.
"
the
word
1934
as
it
does
every
morning
in
this
court
when
the
marshal
announces
that
"the
court
is
now
sitting".
when
congress
said
"now
under
federal
jurisdiction",
it
did
not
mean
"then
under
federal
jurisdiction",
but
that
is
what
the
government
contends.
in
fact,
the
word
"then"
is
the
antonym
for
"now".
"now"
must
be
given
its
ordinary
meaning,
which
the
government
concedes
on
--
in
its
brief,
is
the
date,
effective
date
of
the
statute.
in
this
statute,
the
term
"now"
and
synonyms
are
used
repeatedly
throughout
the
indian
reorganization
act.
the
word
"now"
appears
five
times
in
the
same
sense
throughout
the
act.
the
word
"hereafter"
is
also
used.
the
word
--
the
term
"now"
or
"hereafter"
is
used
three
times;
"heretofore"
is
used
three
times.
i
mention
these
things
because
the
congress
that
read
and
enacted
the
statute
had
a
keen
sense
of
the
temporal
nature
of
the
terms
used
in
the
act.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
pardon
me,
justice
breyer?
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--of
course,
of
course,
justice
breyer.
there
are
many
contexts
in
which
one
could
conceivably,
but
the
context
would
tell
you.
in
fact,
the
government's
--
one
of
the
government's
examples
is
the
use
of
the
word
"now"
in
a
will.
of
course,
everyone
knows
the
will
speaks
as
of
the
date
of
the
passage
of
the
individual.
there's
another
reference
in
the
statute
where
the
government
refers
to
that,
and
the
statute
itself
has
a
very
clear,
different
meaning.
my
reference
to
the
statute
and
the
use
of
the
word
"now"
in
this
statute
is
very,
very
clear.
the
legislation
--
the
statute
refers
to
legislation
"now
pending".
that
had
to
mean
1934.
it
refers
to
boundaries
"now
existing
or
hereafter
established".
it
refers
to
positions
and
indian
tribes
"now
or
hereafter
created".
it
refers
to
lawsuits
"now
pending
or
hereafter
filed".
it
refers
to
tribes
"now
under
federal
jurisdiction".
all
of
those
uses
of
the
word
"now"
are
consistent.
if
the
government
was
correct,
the
word
"now"
would
have
no
meaning
in
that
statute.
i
think
it
was
interesting,
if
one
takes
the
question
presented
as
articulated
by
the
government,
it
says,
"whether
the
indian
reorganization
act
authorizes
the
interior
secretary
to
take
into
trust
on
behalf
of
an
indian
tribe
that
was
not
recognized
--
a
not
recognized
indian
tribe
under
federal
jurisdiction
on
june
18th,
1934.
"
if
you
take
that
word
"not"
and
strike
it
out
of
the
question
presented,
you
get
the
statute.
so,
what
the
government
is
asking
for
is
the
exact
opposite
of
what
the
statute
clearly
requires.
and
all
one
has
to
do
is
look
at
the
question
presenting
--
presented
as--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
it
says,
chief
justice
roberts,
it
says
"indian
tribe".
and
the
word
"indian",
in
that
very
section,
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
section,
says
"the
term
"indian"
as
used
in
this
act.
"
blah,
blah,
blah.
so
then,
later
in
that
same
section,
it
refers
to
"indian
tribe".
it's
important
to
juxtapose
section
5,
which
is
codified
as
465,
and
section
19,
which
is
codified
as
479,
to
look
at
the
statute.
the
first
part
of
section
5
authorizes
the
secretary
to
take
land
for
indians.
now,
the
way
the
government
addresses
that
in
the
government's
brief,
they
took
the
word
465
and
said
the
statute
authorizes
taking
land
for
tribes.
it
actually
says
taking
land
for
indians,
and
then
in
the
latter
part
of
section
5,
it
says
"title"
--
"when
property
is
taken
for
indians,
title
may
be
vested
in
an
individual
indian
or
in
a
tribe.
"
then
when
you
get
to
section
19,
congress
very
carefully
said,
"as
used
in
this
act,
the
term
"indian"
shall
mean.
"
what
we've
been
talking
about
here
today,
and
that's
an
adjective
that
describes
"tribe"
later
in
the
sentence.
there's
two
things
that
the
government
does
in
their
brief
which
i
find
very
interesting.
first
of
all,
the
government
says
the
use
of
the
word
"indian"
doesn't
necessarily
mean
indians.
but
title
i,
section
1,
of
the
united
states
code,
the
first
sentence
in
the
united
states
code,
says:
"the
word
"singular"
--
the
word
"singular"
shall
include
the
plural,
and
the
plural
shall
include
the
word
"singular".
"
so
the
united
states
is
disregarding
that
maxim.
of
course,
the
context
can
always
indicate
something
different.
but
the
government
asks
you
to
ignore
the
singular
or
plural.
and
then
the
other
thing
that
the
government
does
is
to
ask
you
to
understand
that
the
word
"indian"
means
something
when
it's
a
noun
and
something
else
when
it's
an
adjective,
violating
another
primary
construct
--
construction,
statutory
construction.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
--
the
--
yes.
i
understand
that,
justice
alito,
and
--
and
no
statute,
if
you
--
if
you
come
along
70
years
later,
is
it
not
possible
to
find
something
like
that.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
only
consistent
way
to
look
at
that
term
throughout
the
statute
--
and
i
would
say,
first
of
all,
it's
the
language
of
the
statute.
it's
the
context
of
the
words
in
the
statute
where
the
word
"indian"
has
to
mean
certain
things.
it
has
to
have
some
limitation.
otherwise,
the
secretary
can
do
anything,
and
--
and
congress
certainly
didn't
intend
that.
it's
not
just
the
text
of
the
statute.
it's
the
purpose
for
the
statute,
which
was
to
protect
and
remediate
indians
and
indian
tribes
that
have
been
harmed
by
the
allotment
policy.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
use
of
the
word
"tribe"
in
that
question
is
--
is
causing
me
a
problem
momentarily.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
there
were
all
sorts
of
indians
who
were
not
under
federal
jurisdiction.
what
--
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
document
that
the
government
produced
in
19
--
in
just
this
summer.
there
are
four
documents
i
urge
the
court
to
look
at
that
the
government
suddenly
discovered
after
10
years
of
litigation
and
produced
in
august
of
this
summer,
all
of
which
are
interior
department
documents
which
support
our
position
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy.
what
--
the
fact
is
that
there
were
many
indians
throughout
the
united
states
that
were
not
recognized
--
recognized
as
a
part
of
tribes.
they
weren't
groups
of
individuals
with
whom
the
united
states
had
made
treaties.
the
united
states
had
various
different
relationships
with
groups
of
indians,
including
tribes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
in
fact,
many
--
many
of
the
indians
throughout
the
united
states
were
not
connected
or
--
or
tied
up
into
a
formal
tribe.
the
purpose
for
the
indian
allotment
act
was
to
take
a
--
land
out
of
reservations
and
out
of
the
possession
of
indian
tribes
and
distribute
that
to
--
to
indians
in
fee
simple
so
that
they
could
sell
it
to
someone
else.
congress
decided,
the
united
states
decided,
in
the
'30s
that
that
policy
had
been
--
ill-served
the
indians
and
ill-served
the
united
states.
so
the
indian
reorganization
act
was
intended
to
address
and
remediate
that.
at
the
same
time
the
united
states
was
concerned
and
the
congress
was
concerned
that
there
had
to
be
some
limit.
if
there
were
indians
that
had
not
been
adversely
affected
by
the
allotment
act,
they
were
not
intended
to
be,
generally
speaking,
covered
by
the
indian
reorganization
act.
so
what
i
mean
--
i
was
saying
in
response
to
justice
alito's
question
--
it's
not
just
the
text
of
the
statute.
it's
the
purpose
for
the
statute,
which
was
to
provide
some
benefits
and
some
limitations
on
the
damage
done
by
the
allotment
policy.
so
it
was
natural,
when
it
was
necessary
to
come
up
with
some
restriction
on
who
would
be
the
potential
beneficiaries
of
the
statute,
to
look
at
the
tribes
that
were
under
federal
jurisdiction
in
1934
who
had
been
harmed
in
some
fashion.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
what
the
interior
department
did
was,
in
compliance
with
the
statute
--
was
to
set
about
and
create
a
list.
there
was
a
list
created
in
1936,
as
i
understand
it,
chief
justice
roberts.
there
was
subsequent
legislation
that
has
even
a
list
act.
but
the
--
what--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there
was
a
relatively
sharp
distinction.
that
is
to
say,
it
was
indians
that
had
treaties
with
the
united
states,
or
tribes
that
had
treaties
with
the
united
states,
or
had
been
recognized
in
some
fashion
by
the
united
states
government
in
terms
of
a
relationship
between
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
indian
tribes.
now,
the
federal
register
and
federal
records
in
1934
were
not
what
they
are
today,
and
that's
the
reason
why,
when
these
words
were
used,
the
interior
department
set
about
to
look
through
the
history
of
the
interior
department
and
to
come
up
with
a
list
of
tribes
that
would
have
been
covered,
would
have
been
embraced,
by
that
term
now
recognized
in
1934.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
in
fact,
to
the
extent
that
it's
necessary
to
go
back
and
--
and
it
happened
on
a
few
occasions
subsequent
to
1934
that
historical
records
were
reviewed,
relationships
between
the
tribe
and
the
federal
government
were
reviewed.
in
fact,
in
the
government's
brief,
the
government
talks
about
three
tribes
for
which
land
was
taken
into
trust
that
didn't
fit
the
definition
of
now
recognized
--
tribes
recognized
in
1934.
we
went
back
and
looked
at
two
of
those
three
tribes
where
--
in
fact
did
have
treaties
with
the
united
states
and
would
have
been
included.
the
other
would
have
probably
been
included
and
could
be
included
just
exactly
the
way
you
suggested
in
your
question.
the
other
point
that
i
think
is
very
important
to
emphasize
is
that
15
times
since
the
enactment
of
this
statute
congress
has
acted
specifically
to
apply
the
indian
reorganization
act
to
an
indian
tribe
that
had
not
been
covered
in
1934,
evidencing
some
congressional
understanding
that
it
--
it
took
an
act
of
congress
to
bring
a
particular
tribe
under
the
act.
there
is
these--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
what
--
what
--
i
think
i
understand
your
question.
what
the
government
wants
to
do
is
just
take
the
word
"now"
out
of
the
statute
altogether.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
only
way
the
statute
makes
sense
is
to
construe
19--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--chief
justice
roberts,
what
--
it
was
intended
--
members
of
congress
had
to
think
the
word
"now"
meant
something.
in
fact,
there
is
a
colloquy
between
senator
wheeler
and
commissioner
--
bureau
of
indian
affairs
commissioner
collier
that
is
referred
to
in
the
briefs
where
senator
wheeler
was
saying:
well,
there
are
some
--
some
groups
out
in
--
in
california
that
are
no
more
indian
than
you
or
i.
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
that?
and
commissioner
collier,
who
is
the
author
of
the
act,
says:
we
will
stick
the
words
"now
under
federal
jurisdiction
in
there.
"
and
then
he
explains
exactly
what
was
meant
by
that:
that
would
--
that
it
would
cover
tribes
that
existed
in
--
in
19
--
that
would
--
he
says
that
would
limit
the
act
to
indians
now
--
and
he
is
speaking
at
the
time
the
statute
was
being
debated
--
under
federal
jurisdiction.
those
documents
that
the
government
suddenly
discovered
in
august
of
this
year,
which
were
lodged
with
this
court
in
the
latter
part
of
august
of
this
year,
include
a
1936
--
circular
letter
by
commissioner
collier
to
all
of
the
superintendents
throughout
the
united
states.
this
is
the
author
of
the
statute
speaking
in
1936,
and
he
says
"all
persons
of
indian
descent
who
are
members
of
any
recognized
tribe
that
was
under
federal
jurisdiction
at
the
date
of
the
act.
"
now
your
point,
chief
justice
roberts,
is
that
maybe
it
was
unclear
at
the
exact
moment
of
--
of
enactment
which
198,
or
whatever
number
it
might
have
been,
tribes
were
under
that,
but
that's
the
sort
of
information
that
can
be
discerned
by
looking
at
the
history
and
the
records
so
that
a
finite
group
could
be
identified.
it
isn't
perfect,
as
justice
ginsburg's
question
suggests,
but
it
is
a
verifiable
method
of
limiting
what
congress
obviously
intended
to
limit--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
not
in
--
it
says
"indian
tribe"--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
refers,
in
the
second-to-last
sentence
of
section
19
or
479,
"the
term
"tribe"
wherever
used
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
to
refer
to
any
indian
tribe.
"
that's
--
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
word
"indian"
is,
if
you
accept
the
word--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that
just
simply,
i
submit,
defines
the
word
"adult".
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
were
reading
from
section
479,
which
is
at
page
15a
of
the
carcieri
brief.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
now,
the
government,
i
think,
has
the
codified
version
of
it
as
well
as
there
are
some
changes--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i'm
happy
to
do
it
either
way.
the
--
the
brief
--
when
we
put
it
in
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
blue
brief,
we
did
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
i
think
--
but
nonetheless,
justice
scalia,
for
the
purposes
of
this,
it
is
quite
clear
that
if
you
were
a
member
of
congress
in
1934
reading
this
statute
and
seeing
the
words
1934.
in
fact,
when
this
court
in
1978
was
construing
the
statute--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
are
three
categories,
justice
stevens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
if
you
take
the
word
"indian"
out,
but
the
word
--
the
phrase
is
"indian
tribe".
and
congress
specifically
said
the
word
"indian"
wherever
--
now
that's
where
the
government
says
the
word
used
as
a
noun
doesn't
mean
the
same
as
the
word
used
as
an
adjective.
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
but
congress
was
clearly
talking
about
--
when
it
made
three
categories
at
the
beginning
of
that
sentence,
justice
stevens,
it
made
three
categories
basically
to
cover
the
tribes
that
were
recognized
and
then
under
jurisdiction
in
1934,
and
that's
--
the
author
of
the
statute
said
that
in
1936.
he
said
that
in
an
exchange
with
senator
collier.
in
fact,
the
two
other
justice
department
--
interior
department
documents
that
were
reproduced
were
documents
from
the
solicitor
of
the
interior
department
to
the
indian
affairs
person
saying
the
same
thing
in
1978,
the
same
thing
in
1980,
and
the
same
thing
in
1994.
and
when
this
court
construed
the
statute
in
--
in
an
indirect
way
with
respect
to
the
choctaw
tribe
in
1978,
in
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
john,
the
court
said
members
of
any
recognized
bracket,
in
1934,
"tribe
now
under
federal
jurisdiction".
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
the
meaning
is
quite
clear.
in
fact,
justice
breyer--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there's
no
question
that
this
tribe
would
not
qualify--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
there's
no
contention
that
it
would.
no
matter
how
you
define
that
and
the
--
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--both,
justice
kennedy.
they
weren't
either.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
it
does
not
help--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--they
can
be
recognized
later,
justice
kennedy.
in
fact,
congress
specifically
did
that
15
times
between
--
for
the
first
time,
it
was
1936,
and
the
last
time
it
was
1994.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
because
here's
what
congress
said:
in
each
one
of
those
15
cases,
congress
said
--
the
statute,
including
section
5
and
19,
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
"shall
hereafter
apply",
"shall
hereafter
apply",
"shall
be
hereby
extended",
"hereby",
"hereby
extended".
so,
congress,
on
15
occasions,
decided
that
it
was
necessary
to--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
but
it
says
the
word
"indian".
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
may
i
read
this,
justice
stevens?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
"the
term
"tribe"
wherever
used
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
to
refer
to
any
indian
tribe.
"
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
so,
the
word--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
submit
that,
for
purposes
of
construction
of
the
statute
and
using
the
word
consistently,
the
word
"indian"
modifies
tribe,
the
word
"indian"
as
defined,
that's
consistent
with
the
purpose,
that's
consistent
with
the
legislative
history.
it's
consistent
with
the
construction--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
think
you
and
i
must
be
reading
a
different
thing
because
the
sentence
that
--
the
sentence
that
defines
the
word
"indian"
says
"the
term
"indian"
as
used--
"
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
it
does
include
the
word
"indian",
which
does
have
a
temporal
limitation.
if
it
was
"brown
cow"
and
the
word
"brown"
was
defined,
you
would
look
to
the
word
"brown"
to
determine
what
a
brown--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
think
that
the
construction
of
the
statute,
including
the
way
this
court
read
it
in
1978,
the
history,
the
purpose
that
it
was
intended
to
accomplish,
the
use
of
those
words
throughout
the
statute
which
are
consistent,
all
supports
the
proposition
that
it
had
meant
indian
tribes
recognized
and
under
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
and
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
start
with
justice
kennedy's
question,
and
i
think
one
other
justice
asked
about
other
canons
of
construction,
specifically
with
respect
to
sovereignty
of
states.
this
court
said
in
vermont
agency
in
2000
if
congress
is
to
alter
the
constitutional
balance
between
states
and
the
federal
government,
it
must
make
its
intention
to
do
so
unmistakably
clear;
and
justice
kennedy,
i
think
you
asked
that
question
in
the
context
of
the
relationship
between
states
and
indian
tribes,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
seminole
tribe,
in
which
the
court
said
the
congress
must
unequivocally
express
its
intent
to
abrogate
states'
immunity.
as
the
chief
justice
was
pointing
out,
this
is
a
very
broad
grant
of
authority,
if
it
is
what
the
government
says
it
is.
the
secretary
can
take
property
from
the
state,
particularly
a
small
state
like
rhode
island,
but
it
would
be
the
same
anywhere,
and
strip
the
state
of
jurisdiction
and
give
jurisdiction
to
a
dual
sovereign
operating
within
that
state.
we
submit
that
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative
language,
the
legislative
purpose,
the
contemporary
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
author
of
this
statute,
and
everything
stands
for
the
proposition
that
there
was
some
limitation
intended
here.
i
think
the
government
overlooks
the
fact
and
it
somewhat
misstates
it
by
saying
land
may
be
taken
for
tribes.
i've
heard
that
several
times
not
just
in
the
brief
but
during
oral
argument.
section
5
which
is
the
grant
of
authority
says
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
take
land
for
the
purposes
of
providing
land
for
indians
and
then
section
19
defines
the
term
indians.
now
it
may
--
once
it
decides
that
it
may
take
title
it
may
take
land
for
indians,
it
can
then
vest
the
title
in
--
as
it
says
at
the
end
of
section
5
--
in
individual
indians,
individual
indian
or
tribes.
but
it
takes
lands
for
indians;
they
have
to
be
indians
or
land
cannot
be
taken.
the
other
canons
of
construction,
besides
the
ones
that
must
recognize
state
sovereignty,
is
that
words
must
be
given
their
ordinary
meaning
absent
a
contrary
context.
words
are
not
to
be
considered
to
be
superfluous.
there
are
several
instances
of
efforts
to
repeal
by
implication
in
the
government's
brief;
and
i
could
go
on
and
on.
there
are
several
violations
of
various
canons
of
construction.
the
colloquy
is
clear
when
it's
put
in
context.
it's
exactly
what
i
think
you
were
getting
at,
justice
breyer.
there
is
a
difference
between
you
know,
indians
under
jurisdiction,
which
is
what
mr.
commissioner
collier
meant,
and
indians
that
may
have
had
some
connection
with
the
federal
government.
that
whole
colloquy
is
explained
quite
clearly
in
the
--
in
the
document
the
government
discovered
in
august;
and
it's
dated
1980;
it's
a
memorandum
by
the
assistant
solicitor,
and
i
explains
--
it
explains
the
context.
section
--
the
tribe
was
not
--
this
particular
tribe
i
submit
--
and
we
would
describe
this,
this
question
came
up
in
a
couple
of
the
questions,
was
this
tribe
under
federal
jurisdiction
and
should
the
case
be
remanded.
i
know
of
nothing
that
suggests
that
it
was
under
federal
jurisdiction.
i
invite
the
court
to
look
at
page
7
of
our
brief.
the
tribe
was
under
state
jurisdiction,
under
state
control
and
there
is
a
reference
to
that
in
an
explanation
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
21a
and
23a.
i
don't
have
time
to
elaborate
on
that,
but
that
is
answered
there.
u.s.
versus--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
had
--
the
--
the
group
of
indians
called
the
narragansetts,
yes,
have
history
that
does
go
way
back;
but
the
are
relationship
with
the
federal
government
was
what
was
being
considered
where
--
the
indian
reorganization
act
is
--
and
that
relationship
did
not
exist
at
that
time.
u.s.
v
john,
the
bracketed
phrase
doesn't
mean
that
that
phrase
was
unambiguous.
the
court
clearly
understood
that
it
meant
1934,
the
same
as
commissioner
collier
meant,
and
the
same
as
the
statute
indicated.
it
doesn't
show
that
it
was
ambiguous.
the
court
was
speaking
in
1978,
so
it
was
quite
natural
--
instead
of
using
the
word
1934;
and
it
was
necessary
to
get
to
that
question
of
indian
blood
which
the
court
finally
got
to
in
u.s.
v
john
to
--
because
otherwise
we
wouldn't
have
needed
to
get
to
that
question,
if
it
had
been
otherwise
answered
as
--
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
section
19.
