justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
may
--
there
may
not
be,
but
let
me
on
that
score,
take
you
back
to
an
answer
that
mr.
olson
gave.
assume
for
the
moment,
for
the
sake
of
the
question,
that
we
were
to
read
this
the
way
justice
kennedy
and
justice
breyer
suggested,
and
that
is
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
reference
--
the
now
reference
between
recognition
and
jurisdiction
and
say
that
the
now
refers
to
jurisdiction
and
it
refers
to
the
time
of
passage.
if
that
is
the
way
we
read
it,
should
we
remand
this
case
to
the
circuit?
mr.
olson
said
no.
there
is
no
claim
that,
in
fact,
the
tribe
was,
in
fact,
under
jurisdiction
at
the
time
of
passage.
what
is
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
tell
us
what
you
want
us
to
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
case,
you
are
not
here
to
represent
that,
in
fact,
we
may
assume
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
over
the
tribe
at
the
time
of
the
passage?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it
hasn't
--
if
it
hasn't,
then
you're
not
in
the
position
to
make
the
representation
that
mr.
olson
--
i
think
mr.
olson's
answer
suggested
would
be
a
correct
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry.
are
we
in
a
position
to
--
to
draw
or
accept
that
conclusion
here?
i
mean,
that
--
that
wasn't
worked
out.
shouldn't
we
remand
and
have
that
specifically
addressed
and
specifically
address
the
question
of
jurisdiction?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
were
--
you
were
saying
that
the
--
that
a
distinction
simply
had
not
been
drawn
at
the
bia
level,
i
guess,
between
jurisdiction
and
recognition.
and
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
we
are
in
a
position
to
say,
yes,
that's
so
or,
no,
that
isn't
so.
so
that
would
seem
to
me
to
argue
for
a
remand
in
and
of
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
agree?
