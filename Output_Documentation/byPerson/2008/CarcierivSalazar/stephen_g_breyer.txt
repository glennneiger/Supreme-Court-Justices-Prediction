what
about
a
poster
that
says
"give
blood
now".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
put
up
a
poster
that
says
"give
blood
now".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
mean
when
it
was
printed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
the
meaning
of
that
--
the
words
specifically
that
were
added
were
"now
under
federal
jurisdiction".
the
word
"recognized"
was
already
in
the
statute.
so,
it
looks
like
the
"now"
applies
to
"under
federal
jurisdiction".
now,
my
law
clerks,
in
doing
research
on
this,
came
up
with
a
number
of
instances
where
the
tribe
wasn't
recognized
until
1976.
i
think
that
was
true
of
something
called
the
stillaquamish
tribe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
recognized
in
1976,
but
then
they
go
back
and
they
say,
well,
was
it
under
federal
jurisdiction
in
1934?
and
that
seems
a
rather
loose
term
that
includes
the
fact
that
you
are
under
federal
jurisdiction
if,
for
example,
the
federal
government
has
a
treaty
with
you
that
requires
the
federal
government
to
do
something.
suppose
that's
the
right
reading
of
this.
then
should
we
send
this
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
saying
i'm
agreeing
with
you
on
the
meaning.
the
meaning
is
"now",
but
it's
"now
under
federal
jurisdiction".
so,
there
would
be
a
question.
this
tribe
wasn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
sure
he
was,
because
when
i
looked
through
that
whole
thing
it
seemed
to
me
what
they
were
worried
about
--
senator
thomas
was
worried
about
remnants
of
tribes,
and
they
were
talking
about
an
example
of
the
catawba
indians
in
south
carolina,
and
they
had
a
discussion
about
that;
and
then
it
seemed
everybody
on
the
committee
agreed
that
these
catawba
indians
should
not
be
included
if
they
were
only
one
quarter
indian.
they
should
be
included
if
they
were
half
indian.
and
that
meant
that
they
had
to
fall
within
the
other
phrase,
not
the
phrase
that
we
are
talking
about.
so
then
they
say
how
do
we
get
this
result?
i
mean,
because
they
are
a
tribe.
because
they
are
certainly
a
tribe
and
they
are
recognized,
the
catawbas.
and
then
the
answer
to
that
was
--
what's
his
name
--
the
collier
--
collier.
collier
says:
i'll
tell
you
how:
we
add
the
words
"now
under
federal
jurisdiction".
and
he
thought
what
he
was
doing
was
ruling
out
the
catawbas
and
only
allowing
the
half
indians
to
come
in.
now,
ironically,
later
on,
in
the
'40s
i
think,
the
government
decides
that
the
catawba
tribe
is
in
fact
under
federal
jurisdiction
in
1934
because
a
treaty
exists.
anyway,
that's
how
i
read
it
and
the
california
indians
were
quite
secondary
to
what
they
were
talking
about.
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
know
whether
they
were
under
a
tribe
or
not
a
tribe
or
anything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
it
was
fairly
clear.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
they
--
i
mean,
senator
wheeler
was
worried
about
the
catawbas.
then
wheeler
decides,
okay,
the
half-indian
catawbas
fall
in,
but
the
quarter-indian
catawbas
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
go
back
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
learn
a
lot
at
hearings,
actually.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
i
do
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
do
i
do
about
the
fact
--
i
was
looking
this
up
--
collier
and
felix
cohn,
the
world's
authority
on
indian
law,
both
write
at
the
time:
this
means
under
federal
jurisdiction
in
1934;
and
they
write
it
and
they
rewrite
it
and
they
rewrite
it.
they
say
nothing
to
the
contrary.
i
mean,
they
are
the
ones
who
did
it,
so
i
have
to
admit
i'm
pretty
much
moved
by
the
fact
that
they
thought
that's
what
it
meant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
could
only
find
one
instance,
which
is
that
biloxi
tribe,
where
the
--
something,
you
know,
the
ones
in
louisiana
--
aside
from
that
instance,
i
have
not
found
one
other
instance
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
words
1934.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
want
to
list
them,
i'll
look
them
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
believe
that's
organized
or
recognized,
because
what
they
did
in
several
cases,
i
found,
like
the
one,
the
stillaquamish
or
whatever,
they
said,
yes,
we
recognize
them
now.
they
weren't
recognized
in
1934,
but
they
were
under
federal
jurisdiction
in
1934
because
there
were
treaties
that
applied
between
the
federal
government
and
the
indians
which
gave
these
indians
rights
then.
and
that
--
that
seems
consistent
with
what
--
what
collier
and
the
others
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wouldn't
know
that
that's
so,
because
the
--
the
question
i
ask
myself
on
that
is:
were
i
in
congress,
is
this
the
kind
of
thing
i
would
have
delegated
to
the
secretary
to
decide.
and
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
think
that
congress
wanted
to
delegate
the
power
to
the
secretary
to
decide
whether
1934
or
"now"
means
any
time
in
the
future.
well,
i
mean
that's
something
congress
would
decide:
they
meant
by
1934,
or
they
meant
by
"now"
any
old
time
it's
applied.
now
--
now,
you
could
argue
that
both
ways,
but
why
would
you
want
to
delegate?
what
human
being
would
want
to
say:
the
meaning
of
the
word
"now"
is
something
i'm
leaving
to
the
secretary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying
it
unambiguously
means
it.
that's
not
what
i'm
saying.
i'm
saying
it's
totally
ambiguous,
but
what
the
secretary
has
to
say
about
it
is
enlightening
only
insofar
as
the
secretary
knows
more
about
it
than
i.
that's
fine.
but
not
insofar
as
it
delegates
power
to
the
secretary
to
make
up
his
own
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
difficulty
with
the
"tribe"
thing.
i
think
it's
a
very
difficult
case.
i
have
a
hard
time.
but
the
difficulty
with
the
word
"tribe"
is
that
either
that
tribe
has
some
people
in
it
who
are
indians,
or
it
doesn't,
right?
that
has
to
be
true.
now,
if
it
has
some
people
in
it
who
are
indians,
i.e.,
a
person
who
falls
within
the
definition
of
"indian",
then,
of
course,
the
secretary
can
take
land
for
that
because
the
whole
thing
is
for
the
purpose
of
giving
land
to
indians.
but
let's
imagine
a
tribe
that
has
no
indians
in
it
within
the
definition
of
the
act.
you
are
saying
that
this
act
would
give
to
the
secretary
the
power
to
take
land
for
an
entity
that
has
no
members
within
the
act.
now,
that
is
pretty
hard
for
me
to
accept.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
is
one
thing.
it
says
it's
for
the
purpose.
we
--
we
give
the
secretary
the
power
to
take
land
for
a
tribe
for
the
purpose
of
giving
land
to
indians.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
we
have
assumed
a
tribe
that
has
no
such
members
because
"indian"
has
a
special
definition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
collier,
himself,
would
have
been
wrong.
because
collier
in
this
great
famous
colloquy
says,
when
he
adds
these
four
words,
he
says
to
the
committee:
that
would
limit
the
act
to
the
indians
--
the
act
would
be
limited
to
the
indians
now
under
federal
jurisdiction
except
that
other
indians
of
more
than
one-half
indian
blood
would
get
help.
so
what
he
is
thinking
in
his
mind
is
if
you
have
any
kind
of
entity
or
a
person
who
is
more
than
one-half
indian
blood,
fine.
the
secretary
can
act.
but
suppose
we
have
an
entity
that
has
only
people
who
have
less
than
one-half
indian
blood.
then
they
are
out
of
luck
unless
they
are
now
under
federal
jurisdiction.
