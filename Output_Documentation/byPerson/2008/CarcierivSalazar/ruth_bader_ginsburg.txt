but
we're
told
that
that
--
that
effort
was
ridden
--
ridden
with
mistakes.
so
could
you
have,
under
your
definition,
a
tribe
that
is
recognized
relatively
recently,
whether
it
is
about
16,
but
that
was,
in
fact,
a
tribe
in
1934;
that
is,
the
--
although
it
wasn't
formally
recognized
until
later,
it
was,

fact,
a
tribe
in
1934?

as
you
read
the
statute,
ms.
maynard,
the
words
"now
under
federal
jurisdiction"
could
be
deleted
and
the
statute
would

urging.
so
what

the
words
"now
under
federal
jurisdiction"
add?
justice
ruth

how
did
it
get
to
be
recognized?
i
thought
the
recognition
reflects
that
it's
had
a
history
going
way,
way
back?
