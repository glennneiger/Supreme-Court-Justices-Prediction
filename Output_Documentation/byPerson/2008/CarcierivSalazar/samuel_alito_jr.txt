doesn't
it
have
to
be
correct
because
in
--
in
section
19
it
says
that
the
term
"indian"
means,
among
other
things,
all
other
persons
of
one-half
or
more
indian
blood.
now,
the
use
of
"indian"
there
can't
be
limited.
it
would
be
circular
if
that
definition
applied
to
the
use
of
that
adjective
there.
