chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-526,
carcieri
v.
kempthorne.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
--
what
about
the
additional
definition
in
section
19
of
"tribe",
which
is
not
limited
the
way
the
first
sentence
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
understanding
--
maybe
i've
got
this
wrong,
but
there
was
not
then,
as
there
is
now,
a
list
of
tribes
that
are
recognized
and
under
federal
jurisdiction.
so
how
--
how
do
you
tell
in
1934
who
is
under
federal
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
guess
the
point
is
that,
given
the
weight
that
you
are
placing
on
the
word
"now",
you
would
think
there
was
some
clear
way
to
say
who
was
recognized
before
then
and
who
was
recognized
after
that.
and
i
--
i
just
don't
know
what
the
test
of
recognition
was
in
1934.
but
if
they
were
drawing
--
if
congress
were
drawing
a
sharp
line,
presumably,
it
would
be
based
on
a
sharp
distinction;
and,
yet,
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
real
sharp
distinction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
that's
not
true,
because
now
you
have
a
very
clear
system.
you
are
recognized
if
you
are
on
the
list.
if
you
don't
--
you
know,
maybe
you
shouldn't
be
on
the
list;
maybe
you
should
be.
but
you
are
recognized
if
you
are
on
the
list.
that
wasn't
the
case
in
1934.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
maynard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
the
statute
reads
the
same
whether
"now"
is
in
there
or
not?
you
read
it
as
saying
any
recognized
indian
tribe
under
federal
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
saying
the
only
way
that
makes
sense
is
to
read
it
as
if
it
weren't
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
so
you're
applying
now,
when
you're
talking
about
who
is
of
indian
descent--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--indian
descent
of
those
in
1934,
but
not
when
it's
determining
--
in
other
words,
you
say
the
indian
descent
as
of
when?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
do
about
united
states
v.
john?
there
the
court
in
describing
an
indian,
indian
descent,
went
out
of
their
way
to
include
in
brackets
the
phrase
"any
recognized
in
1934
tribe
now
under
federal
jurisdiction?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it
--
it
may
have
shown
it's
ambiguous,
but
it
shows
how
--
shows
how
we
resolved
the
ambiguity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
--
we
are
talking
about
an
extraordinary
assertion
of
power.
the
secretary
gets
to
take
land
and
give
it
a
whole
different
jurisdictional
status
apart
from
state
law
and
all
--
wouldn't
you
normally
regard
these
types
of
definitions
in
a
restrictive
way
to
limit
that
power
instead
of
saying
whenever
he
wants
to
recognize
it,
then
he
gets
the
authority
to
say
this
is
no
longer
under
rhode
island
jurisdiction;
it's
now
under
my
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
do
we
know
which
one
of
them
benefits
the
indian?
i
mean,
have
the
indians
benefited
from
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
last
50
years?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
are
the
plans
the
indians
have
of
doing
with
the
land
once
it's
determined
to
be
indian
land
subject
to
trust
of
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
of
course,
the
use
of
that
land
would
not
be
limited
to
housing,
right?
they
could
engage
in
other
activities
that
indian
tribes
can
engage
in,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
your
friend
on
the
other
side
says
the
exact
opposite.
it
was
backward-looking.
they
had
had
the
allotment
policy,
which
they
decided
was
not
a
good
idea,
and
yet,
that
had
resulted
in
indian
land
being
turned
over
to
in
fee
simple,
and
this
is
a
way
to
compensate
for
the
discredited
allotment
policy.
so,
if
you
weren't
recognized
in
1934,
you
were
not
penalized
by
the
allotment
policy,
so
you
didn't
need
the
benefit.
i
think
that
backward-looking
perspective
seems
to
make
perfect
sense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
an
indian
--
an
indian
community.
now,
if
we
are
looking
for
a
definition
of
"indian",
we
go
back
to
the
first
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it
does
it
four
times,
you
ought
to
give
effect
to
it
at
least
once.
it
says
"indian
tribes
now
under
federal
jurisdiction.
"
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
key
restriction,
and
that
it's
not
taken
away
by
that
last
sentence,
which
again
reiterates
that
it's
"indian
tribe".
and
then
in
the
last
clause
to
which
you
refer,
it's
still
"indians
residing
on
one
reservation".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
defined
term.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course
if
we
just
--
i'm
sorry
to
jump
back
to
the
other
provision,
but
if
we
disagree
with
your
interpretation
and
congress
thinks
we
are
wrong
they
can
pass
another
one
of
these
15,
16
provisions
that
they
have
that
says
this
tribe
is
--
is
recognized
now.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
i'm
sorry
to
keep
you
there
longer
than
you
may
want
to
be.
[laughter]
why
--
why
else
--
why
would
congress
then
enact
these
15
or
16
separate
provisions
if
they
think
the
--
if
in
this
provision
they
think
it's
not
necessary?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
olson,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-526,
carcieri
versus
salazar.
