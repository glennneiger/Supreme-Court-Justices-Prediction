justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
under
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934,
the
--
which
i
would
refer
to
--
i
will
refer
to
as
ira,
the
federal
government
is
authorized
to
take
land
and
hold
it
in
trust
for
indian
tribes
for
the
purpose
of
providing
land
for
indians.
the
act
defines
the
term
“indian”
to
“include
all
persons
of
indian
descent
who
are
members
of
any
organized
indian
tribe
now
under
federal
jurisdiction.”
in
1998,
the
federal
government
acting
through
the
secretary
of
the
interior
sought
to
exercise
its
authority
under
ira
and
accept
into
trust
31
acres
of
land
owned
by
the
narragansett
indian
tribe
and
located
in
charlestown,
rhode
island.
the
state
of
rhode
island,
its
governor
in
the
town
opposed
the
trust
acquisition
which
would
result
in
federal
rather
than
local
supervision
of
the
land.
they
argued
that
the
narragansett
tribe
was
not
under
federal
jurisdiction
when
the
ira
was
enacted
in
1934
and
was
not
recognized
by
the
federal
government
until
1983.
thus,
they
argued,
the
secretary
lacked
authority
to
take
land
into
trust
for
members
of
the
narragansett
tribe.
the
department
of
interior
board
of
indian
appeals,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
all
rejected
this
challenge
and
upheld
the
legality
of
the
acquisition.
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
statutory
phrase
now
under
federal
jurisdiction,
is
ambiguous
because
it
could
refer
either
to
tribal
status
at
the
time
the
ira
was
enacted
in
1934
or
at
the
time
the
secretary
sought
to
take
land
into
trust.
because
the
court
of
appeals
found
both
interpretations
to
be
reasonable,
it
deferred
to
the
secretary’s
view
that
it
could
exercise
its
trust
authority
for
the
members
of
any
tribe
that
the
interior
department
had
formally
recognized
even
if
that
recognition
came
after
1934.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
phrase
“now
under
federal
jurisdiction”
refers
to
those
tribes
that
were
under
federal
jurisdiction
when
the
ira
was
enacted
in
1934.
this
reading
is
consistent
with
the
plain
and
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
“now”
and
aligns
with
other
provisions
of
the
ira
in
which
congress
used
the
distinct
phrase
“now”
or
“hereafter”
to
refer
to
post-enactment
events.
our
reading
is
also
consistent
with
the
interpretation
given
the
word
“now”
by
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
at
the
time
of
the
statute's
enactment.
in
this
case,
neither
the
secretary
nor
the
tribe
defended
the
acquisition
by
arguing
that
the
tribe
was
under
federal
jurisdiction
in
1934.
and
the
evidence
in
the
records
of
this
question
is
to
the
contrary.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
