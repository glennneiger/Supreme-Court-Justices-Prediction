mr.
olson,
can
i
ask
you
a
kind
of
a
--
maybe
it's
too
obvious
--
preliminary
question?
is
there
a
definition
of
the
term
"indian
tribe"
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
section
19
defines
the
term
"indian",
but
there
is
no
definition
of
what
an
indian
tribe
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see
that
--
that
word
isn't
limited
by
time
or
date,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
word
"indian"
--
it
says
the
word
"indian",
in
the
last
sentence,
"21
years.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
looking
at
the
government
brief.
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
olson,
am
i
not
correct
that
the
membership
in
the
tribe
is
just
one
category
of
persons
who
are
included
in
the
broader
definition
of
the
term
"indian"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
one
of
the
them
is
members
of
the
tribe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
another
is
one
who
--
indians
who
have
attained
the
age
of
21
years.
the
other
other
is
--
let's
see.
"the
term
"tribe"
wherever
used
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
to
refer
to
any
indian
tribe,
organized
band,
pueblo,
or
the
indians
residing
on
one
reservation.
"
now,
that
reference
to
the
term
"tribe",
as
opposed
to
"indian",
doesn't
have
any
limit
on
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olson,
let
me
just
make
sure
i
get
this
off
my
chest,
and
then
i'll
be
quiet.
the
first
sentence
in
section
19
defines
the
term
"indian".
and
that's
the
section
you're
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
this
act.
the
second
refers
to
--
the
second
sentence
refers
to
eskimos.
the
third
sentence
defines
the
term
"tribe",
the
term
"tribe"
--
and
in
that
definition
there
is
no
reference
to
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i'm
talking
about
the
third
--
the
first
sentence
defines
the
term
"indian";
the
third
sentence
defines
the
term
"tribe".
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
"organized
band,
pueblo,
or
the
indians
residing
on
one
reservation.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
word
"indian"
does
not
modify
the
word
"tribe"
as
used
in
the
third
sentence.
that's
my
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
saying
for
purposes
of
getting
the
meaning
of
the
word
"tribe",
just
look
at
the
sentence
defining
that
term,
and
that
doesn't
refer
to
any
time
limit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
limit
it
to
indian
tribe.
it
says,
shall
include
"any
indian
tribe,
organized
band,
pueblo,
or
the
indians
residing
on
a
reservation.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
maynard,
would
you
clarify
one
other
thing
for
me?
the
sentence
in
question
with
the
word
"now"
in
it
and
so
forth,
does
that
have
the
meaning
that
it
includes
descendants
who
are
less
than
a
half-blood,
quarter-blood,
eighth-blood
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
is
an
expansive
definition
of
the
term
"indian",
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
limited
definition
of
"the
tribe"
really
is
quite
irrelevant
to
this
--
to
this
case.
the
term
"indian"
is
defined
to
include
two
classes
of
persons:
one
who
are
members
of
a
certain
category
of
tribes
and
others
who
have
more
than
half
indian
blood.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
and
then
you
get
to
the
definition
of
"tribe"
that
comes
later.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you're
talking
about
the
definition
of
1934,
it
said
tribes
located
west
of
the
mississippi.
if
they
just
limited
it
to
that,
that
wouldn't
have
limited
the
definition
of
"indian".
i
mean
the
definition
of
"tribe".
it
would
have
made
the
category
of
--
of
persons
of
indian
dissent
or
eligible
to
be
treated
as
indians
and
whose
eligibility
is
determined
by
tribal
membership,
limited
but
the
--
not
to
include
all
tribes.
so
you
can
limit
it,
as
i
say,
to
tribes
west
of
the
mississippi.
but
then
when
you
get
down
to
defining
the
term
"tribe",
there
is
no
such
definition.
so
that
i
just
think
the
fight
about
what
"now"
means
is
totally
irrelevant
to
the
meaning
of
the
definition
of
"tribe".
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
describes
the
subcategory
of
indian
tribes
who
--
for
whom
members
can
qualify
even
though
they
don't
have
half
blood.
that's
the
point.
it
picks
up
people
who
are
less
than
half
blood
if
they
are
members
of
of
those
tribes.
