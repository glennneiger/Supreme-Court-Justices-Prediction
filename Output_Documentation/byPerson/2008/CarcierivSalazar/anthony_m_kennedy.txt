justice

what
sort
of
--
excuse
me.
what
sort
of
tribes
were
not
under
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
pardon
me.
what
--
what
--
yes,
what
members
of
tribes
were
not
under
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
there,
then
--
were
there
persons
of
indian
descent
who
were
not
under
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
kind
of
persons
would
those
be,
persons
without
a
tribal
affiliation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
wouldn't
qualify
for
two
reasons
--
a,
they
weren't
recognized;
and
b,
they
weren't,
in
1934,
under
federal
jurisdiction?
or
either?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
i
suppose
that
what
the
government
wants
us
to
do
is
put
in
two
commas:
the
indian
as
used
in
section
--
a
person
of
indian
descent,
comma,
who
are
members
of
any
recognized
indian
tribes,
comma,
now
under
federal
jurisdiction.
that
still
might
not
help
if
they
weren't
under
federal
jurisdiction
in
1934.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
if
they
were
recognized
later?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
agree
that
"recognized
later"
complies
with
this
statute
in
your
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that,
seems
to
me,
not
to
help
you,
because
if
they
are
the
same,
then
that
would
apply
to
both.
justice
breyer
was
suggesting,
as
i
had
earlier,
that
maybe
you
can
make
a
distinction
between
those
were
under
federal
jurisdiction
then
and
recognized
tribes
now.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
chief
justice's
question,
and
i
was
going
to
put
the
same
question
to
mr.
olson,
is
whether
or
not
there
is
--
is
some
canon
of
construction,
some
principle
of
federalism
which
makes
us
be
very
cautious
before
we
take
land
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
it
sounds
to
me
plausible.
is
there
any
authority
for
the
proposition
i
just
stated?
have
we
said
that
in
cases
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
have
we
said
the
opposite,
that
there
is
no--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
is
there
any
overriding
principles
about
which
we
must
be
most
cautious
before
we
interpret
the
statute
as
depriving
the
state
of
the
ownership
and
jurisdiction
of
this
land?
is
there
anything
in
the
cases
either
way
on
that
point?
