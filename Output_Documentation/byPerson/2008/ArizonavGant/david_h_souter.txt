justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
do
have
a
--
we
do
obviously
require
a
justification
for
the
bright-line
rule
itself.
and
--
and
the
problem
that
this
case
raises,
i
think,
if
anything
more
acutely
than
any
of
the
others
that
we've
had
recently,
is
that
it
seems
if
--
if
your
position
is
--
is
going
to
be
accepted,
to
divorce
the
search
totally
from
the
justification
for
the
chimel
rule.
and
--
and
at
some
point
we've
either
got
to
say,
all
right,
it's
no
longer
a
chimel
rule,
there's
some
other
justification
for
the
bright-line
rule;
or
we've
got
to
say,
to
purport
to
apply
the
chimel
rule
in
a
case
like
this,
handcuffed
in
the
back
of
the
police
car
and
so
on,
is
--
is
to
turn
the
law
into
nonsense.
and
--
and
i
--
i
think
we've
got
that
choice
in
front
of
us.
do
we
have
a
new
and
different
rule,
or
do
we
apply
chimel
and
say,
you
just
can't
go
this
far.
this
is
like
the
station
house.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
know
of
any
one
of
those
cases
in
which
the
officer
got
hurt?
do
you
know
of
any
one
of
those
cases
in
which
the
person
who
got
out
of
the
police
cruiser
made
a
beeline
for
--
for
his
own
car?
in
fact,
so
far
as
i
know,
we
are
--
we
are
not
even
sure
that
those
people
came
out
of
automobiles
before
they
were
put
in
a
police
cruiser.
but
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
they
went
to
their
own
car
and
tried
to
get
a
gun
to
hurt
the
cop?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
he
--
did
he
have
--
have
his
hands
handcuffed
behind
his
back?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
he
was
able
to
drive
the
car?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'd
really
like
to
meet
him.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
you
agree
it's
perfectly
workable
to
say
that
if
the
defendant
has
been
taken
to
the
police
station,
they
can't
then
search
the
car--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
isn't
it
equally
workable
to
say
when
the
defendant
is
handcuffed
and
put
in
the
back
of
a
cruiser,
they
can't
do
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
and
--
and
we
are
talking
now
about
administeribility.
the
police
station
rule
is
administrable;
it
makes
for
a
good
bright-line
rule;
why
doesn't
handcuffs
in
the
back
of
the
cruiser
make
for
an
equally
bright
line?
