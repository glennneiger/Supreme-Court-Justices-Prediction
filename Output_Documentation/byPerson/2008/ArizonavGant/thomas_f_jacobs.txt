mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
first
like
to
address
the
issue
of
the
historical
basis
for
the
fourth
amendment
that
was
raised
earlier.
i
would
note
that
in
the
respondent's
brief,
on
page
13
footnote
5
and
on
pages
15
through
16,
the
lafave
treatise
is
cited.
that
treatise
addressed,
primarily
in
the
context
of
automobile
searches,
a
history
of
the
--
the
nature
of
fourth
amendment
restrictions
on
that
type
of
search.
we
also
draw
from
chimel
itself,
which
contained
an
evaluation
of
the
history
of
fourth
amendment
searches
in
general
in
order
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
searches
which
are
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
must
be
tied
to
the
twin
exigencies
on
which
they
are
based.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
if
the
court,
mr.
justice
scalia,
if
you're
suggesting
that
a
bright-line
rule
might
be
adopted
that
is
essentially
exactly
like
the
search
of
person
incident
to
arrest,
the
problem
is
that
in
an
arrest
situation
the
police
have
exclusive
dominion
and
control
over
the
person.
they
have
that
person
in
their
custody,
that
person
realistically,
at
the
point
when
they
have
taken
that
person
into
their
custody,
historically
had
been
recognized
as
a
subject
of
search,
and
that
has
been
consistent
throughout
our
jurisprudence
in
the
fourth
amendment.
we
have
always
recognized
that
right.
the
problem
is
when
you
take
an
item
like
a
car
that
is
divorced
from
the
person
who
is
in
the
custody
of
the
police
and
now
extend
that
right
to
search
to
the
individual
or
to
the
car,
which
is
not
necessarily
something
over
which
the
police
have
a
right
to
dominion
and
control.
they
have
no
problem
with
the
car.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
in
--
in
terms
of
extension
of
the
car
rights?
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
i
--
i
can
refer
the
case
to
the
lafave
treatise
in
terms
of
a
complete
history
upon
that,
but
the
court
has
always--
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
the
--
the
court
has
raised
a
good
point,
but
what
we
--
what
is
consistent,
whether
it's
cars
or
not
cars,
is
the
requirement
that
searches
under
the
fourth
amendment
be
supported
by
warrants
or
an
exception.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
the--
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
--well,
justice
kennedy,
it
explains
the
difference
between
a
person
and
something
that
is
not
the
person,
something
that
is
divorced
physically
from
the
person,
in
the
same
sense
that
mr.
chimel's
house
was
separate
from
his
person.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
well,
keeping
in
mind
the
police
have
no
right
to
search
the
car
except
under
delineated
exceptions.
and
what
the
government
is
asking
here--
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
--well,
what
the
petitioner
is
asking,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
belton
rule
be
interpreted
so
expansively
that
it's
no
longer
simply
a
bright-line
rule
of
what
you
can
search,
but
it's
actually
a
bright-line
rule
that
removes
judicial
review
from
when
you
can
conduct
that
search.
and
the
problem
with
that
is--
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
--no.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
no,
mr.
justice
alito.
we
do
not
have
to
show
that
there
are
any
special
circumstances,
and
we
do
not
necessarily
have
to
overrule
belton
here.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
that
is
an
accurate
statement
of
the
holding
of
belton,
justice
alito.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
well,
we
do
not
lose,
justice
alito.
the
reason
is
because
of
the
focus
that
the
petitioner
places
on
the
aspect
of
that
holding.
they
take
it
in
a
vacuum.
they
don't
look
at
the
word
"contemporaneous"
in
terms
of
defining
"incident
to
arrest".
the
problem
with
the
search
in
this
case
and
so
many
others
is
that
the
search
that
is
conducted
is
after
the
police
have
taken
custody
and
secured
the
individual.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
there
are
two
views
of
that.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
justice
breyer,
we
are
here
to
focus
on
exactly
the
issue
of
what
is
contemporaneous
and
i
believe
that
it's
important
to
focus
on
exactly
what
belton
arose
out
of.
belton
arose
out
of
as
this
court
is
well
aware
four
individuals
who
were
taken
out
of
a
car,
all
four
placed
under
arrest
one
set
of
handcuffs
all
around
the
car,
and
arguably
all
arguably
had
access
to
or
control
over
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
vehicle.
that's
one
of
the
requirements
of
belton's
holding
is
that
they
have
to
arguably
have
access
to
the
passenger
compartment.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
well
if
we
consider
justice
alito
that
officer
safety
is
a
function
of
when
you
make
that
assessment.
is
officer
safety
most
at
risk
when
the
person
is
initially
seized?
yes.
however,
once
they
are
in
the
back
of
a
police
car
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
they
pose
a
threat
to
no
up
with
and
the
record
is
clear
on
that.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
if
one
were
to
assume
a
search
was
conducted
at
that
moment.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
i'm
sorry.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
if
immediately
they
search
after
they
have
finished
restraining
the
person
and
there
is
a
defined
period
between
it,
be
it
30
seconds
or
minute
or
2
minutes,
that's
not
contemporaneous
because
the
reasons
supporting
that
search
are
not
supported
by
the
facts
in
the
exigency.
that
is
the
problem
here
because
belton
was
a
situation
where
there
was
an
immediate
and
continuing
risk
to
the
officer.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
mr.
chief
justice
we
look
at
buie,
we
look
at
mincey,
we
look
at
chimel,
and
in
each
of
those
cases
this
court
affirmed
that
the
focus
is
on
the
risk
posed
by
the
arrestee;
in
mincey
the
court
noted
that
a
search
conducted
to
address
the
immediate
risk.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
those
are
not
all
pre-belton
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
mincey
was
after
belton,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
those
are
all
pre-thornton
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
in
belton,
your
honor,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
specifically
waived
this
analysis
that
we
are
dealing
with
in
this
case
but
it
is
true
that
the
arrestee
was
secured.
the
issue
was
whether
he
was
a
recent
occupant
of
the
vehicle
when
he
was
apprehended
and
whether
we
should
even
consider
application
of
belton.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
exactly
what
was
left
when
it
began,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
if
we
assume
that
that
assessment
is
something
new,
mr.
chief
justice
then
we
are
accepting
without
a
basis
petitioner's
interpretation
of
belton's
bright-line
rule
as
extending
beyond
simply
what
is
the
permissible
scope
of
the
search.
remembering
that
belton
only
applied
chimel
to
the
automobile
situation
petitioner
advocates
a
much
much
too
broad
interpretation
of
this
bright
line
rule
that
arose
out
of
belton
and--
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
--well
justice
alito
stare
decisus
of
course
always
counts
except
where
we're
wrong,
now
in
the
case
that
you
are
proposing.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
that's
correct.
stare
decisis
is
important,
but
if
you're
wrong
you
have
to
consider
overruling
is
my
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
yes
and
if
the
court
is
considering
it
mr.
justice
alito
if
we
would
like
me
to
answer
the
question
assuming
we
should
overrule
belton
why
we
should
do
it
the
answer
is
that
chimel
provides
us
with
sufficient
tools
for
officers
to
protect
their
safety
in
the
field
because
we
recall
there
are
other
exceptions
to
automobile
searches
which
are
based
on
actual
grounds.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
yes.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
i
understand,
justice
breyer,
and
the
answer
is
that
--
two
things:
one,
and
first
and
foremost,
belton's
general
assumption,
which
is
essentially
required
for
the
application
of
the
bright-line
rule,
is
empirically
not
true.
with
police
procedures
as
we
understand
them
today,
routinely
arrestees
are
secured,
they
are
handcuffed,
they
are
routinely
placed
in
the
back
of
patrol
cruisers.
and
even
the
amici
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case
acknowledged
that
officers
are
not
going
to
deviate
from
those
procedures
just
to
make
a
search
in
the
future
if
the
rule
is
changed,
but
primarily
that,
that
the
assumption
that
underlies
belton
is
not
shown
to
be
empirically
true.
it's
empirically
false.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
yeah,
i
misspoke
then.
mincey
would
have
been
before
belton
and
would
have
been
a
basis,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
the
court
to
apply--
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
--if
mincey
was,
then
i
would
hazard
a
guess
that
the
other
three
were
as
well,
your
honor,
except
for
buie.
and
i
don't
have
a
cite
on
that
as
to
the
year
for
buie.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
i
would
agree
with
that
statement,
justice
stevens.
that's
a
correct
statement.
and
buie
is
1990,
your
honor.
my
able
staff
has
provided
the
answers.
but
we
have
to
recall,
justices,
that
we
are
at
all
times
looking
to
the
fourth
amendment,
its
twin
exigencies,
and
the
requirement
that
this
court
has
consistently
held,
that
in
order
to
avoid
a
warrant,
there
must
be
a
clearly
defined
and
limited
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement.
now,
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
will
yield
the
floor.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
exactly
correct.
in
those
situations
belton
would
apply.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i'm
not
being
articulate
enough,
i
think,
because
i
keep
coming
back
to
the
same
thing.
the
bright-line
rule
in
belton
was
the
extent
of
the
permissible
search,
not
the
trigger
for
the
permissible
search.
although
belton
indicated
that
the
arrest
--
an
arrest
of
a
person,
if
he
is
deemed
a
recent
occupant
and
if
the
search
is
conducted
contemporaneously
with
that
arrest,
allows
the
search.
it
is
the
scope
of
the
search
that
was
permitted,
because
we
couldn't
figure
out,
as
a
consistent
matter,
what
was
reaching
distance
when
we
dealt
with
that
particular
and
problematic
situation.
and
that's
from
belton.
and
footnote
3
again
comes
back
to
that.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
belton
only
requires
that
if
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
vehicle
is
arguably
within
the
reach
of
an
arrestee
who
was
a
recent
occupant,
that
the
police
may
contemporaneously
search
the
passenger
compartment
without
regard
for
how
far.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
belton--
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
not
any
specific
portion
of
the
compartment.
that's
what
belton
said.
you
don't
have
to
prove
he
could
reach
the
jacket
in
the
back
seat.
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
he
could
reach
the
briefcase
under
the
passenger
seat.
you
just
have
to
prove
that
he
could
reach
the
passenger
compartment.
and
we
will
generalize
that
if
you
can
reach
the
passenger
compartment,
you
can
reach
anything
in
it.
and
that
was
the
generalization.
and
even
though
we
know
from
police
procedures
that
empirically
that's
not
really
true,
we
know
that
we
can't
--
the
petitioner
can't
cite
a
single
instance
where
somebody
has
gone
back
to
his
car,
grabbed
a
weapon,
and
attacked
an
officer.
it
just
hasn't
happened.
empirically
it's
false.
and
that,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out
perhaps
by
his
question,
is
one
of
the
flaws
of
belton
that
courts
may
continue
to
struggle
with,
but
the
bright-line
doesn't
change.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
the
consistent
holdings
of
this
court,
in
analyzing
this
type
of
situation
under
the
fourth
amendment,
have
held
that
the
arrestee
is
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
into
determining
whether
there
is
an
exemption
to
the
fourth
amendment
requirement.
and
this
dovetails,
essentially,
into
the
argument
we
have
against
the
petitioner's
thought
that
third
parties
should
be
the
focus.
but
they
weren't
in
chimel,
they
weren't
in
mincey,
they
weren't
in
buie.
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
no.
they
are
not
going
to
be
difficult
calls.
the
focus
being
on
the
arrestee,
the
officer--
mr.
thomas
f.
jacobs
--officers
have
--
well,
first
of
all,
again,
the
focus
for
the
analysis
is
on
the
danger
from
the
arrestee,
and
we
know
that
from
buie
and
the
many
cases
that
go
with
it.
but,
importantly,
officers
have
other
tools
that
they
can
use,
other
than
searching
somebody's
car
when
they
don't
have
probable
cause.
they
can
temporarily
detain
people
for
investigative
purposes.
they
can
separate
them
from
the
area
of
vehicle
and
the
arrest,
and
move
them
away.
they
call
for
backup
typically.
in
this
case,
for
example,
they
had
--
they
had
four
or
five
officers
on
scene,
and
the
scene,
objectively,
according
to
the
officers,
was
secure.
they
said
they
had
control
of
the
scene.
and
that's
an
example
of
the
use
of
police
procedures
that
are
available
other
than
searching
that
establish
officer
safety
and
serve
to
protect
our
officers
in
the
field
without
offending
the
fourth
amendment.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
yield
the
floor.
thank
you.
