mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
more
than
27
years
ago
in
belton
this
court
applied
its
prior
decisions
in
chimel
and
robinson
to
the
arrest
of
a
recent
occupant
of
an
automobile.
the
court
sought
to
forge
a
workable
straightforward
rule
that
could
be
easily
applied
and
predictably
enforced
by
law
enforcement
officers
in
the
field
in
this
dangerous
and
dynamic
situation.
after
careful
consideration,
this
court
held
that
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
vehicle
was
deemed
to
be
under
the
immediate
control
of
the
arrestee.
the
court
also
made
clear
that
the
search
need
only
be
a
contemporaneous
incident
of
the
arrest.
there
are
three
reasons,
all
well-established
by
this
court's
case
law,
why
officers,
law
enforcement
officers,
need
not
demonstrate
a
threat
to
their
safety
or
need
to
preserve
evidence
prior
to
searching
an
automobile
incident
to
arrest,
even
if
all
of
the
recent
occupants
of
the
vehicle
have
been
arrested
and
secured.
first,
neither
justification
need
exist
in
a
particular
case.
this
court
has
made
clear
in
robinson
that
a
search
incident
to
arrest
requires
no
additional
justification.
it's
the
fact
of
arrest
that
justifies
the
search.
second,
the
search
need
only
be
a
contemporaneous
incident
of
the
arrest
or
substantially
contemporaneous
with
the
arrest.
obviously
a
search
can
be
contemporaneous
even
if
the
arrestee
has
been
secured.
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
correct.
that
would
be
remote
in
time
and
location,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
time
and
location,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
the
arrestee
is
still
at
the
same
location
at
the
scene
of
the
arrest.
it's
not
remote
in
place
or
time
because
it
--
it
--
the
arrest
and
the
search
occur
in
a
short
period
of
time
at
the
scene
of
the
--
of
the
arrest.
and
while
he
--
the
arrestee
is
secured
to
one
degree
or
another,
in
belton
this
court
wanted
a
workable,
straightforward
rule
that
officers
could
apply
across
the
board
and
not
have
to
look
at
particular
facts
and
circumstances.
so--
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
--the
third
is
requiring
a
justification
is
anathema
to
a
bright-line
rule.
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
wanted
in
belton,
was
a
rule
that
law-enforcement
officers
would
know
how
to
apply
from
one
case
to
another,
that
wouldn't
vary
based
upon
the
particular
facts
of
the
arrest.
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
i
think
in
belton
this
court
did
apply
chimel
and
simply
said,
in
this
recurring
situation
we
need
a
bright-line
rule
that
can
be
easily
determined
and
enforced
by
officers--
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
--the
fact
that
officers
have
for
27
years
applied
it;
it's
a
workable
rule.
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
your
honor,
there
is
not
much
on
searches
incident
prior
to
1914,
the
weeks
case.
there
really
is
not
any--
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
right,
but
the
--
the
search
incident
language
and
application--
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
--yes,
i
do,
very
well,
your
honor.
but
here
we
--
we
have
no
probable
cause.
so
it
would
not
affect
the
situation
here.
this
is
purely
a
--
a
belton
search
for
officer
safety
and
preservation
of
evidence.
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
there
is
still
a
risk.
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
belton,
no.
the
arrestees
were
not
physically
restrained
in
a
vehicle.
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
no,
your
honor.
we're
asking
that
belton
be
applied
as
it
has
been
applied
by
virtually
every
court
in
the
country
and
--
and,
in
fact,
in
this
court
in
thornton.
that
as
--
as
long
as
the
arrestee
remains
at
the
scene
and
the
search
is
contemporaneous
with
the
arrest,
the
officer
is
entitled
to
--
to
conduct
a
search
of
the
vehicle.
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
well,
your
honor--
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
--in
--
in
our
reply
brief
we
pointed
out
in
2007
there
were
93
reported
cases
where
arrestees
cuffed
in
the
back
of
a
patrol
car
escaped.
so
it
--
it's
very
possible
this
could
happen.
now,
you
have
to
know--
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
--in
one
of
the
cases
the
arrestee
went
to
his
vehicle
but
simply
took
off
and
led
the
police
on
a
high-speed
chase,
but
none
in
--
where
they
went
to
the
vehicle
and
grabbed
a
weapon.
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
yes.
yes,
he
had--
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
--yes.
well,
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding
--
i'm
not
an
expert
on
this,
but
it's
my
understanding
from
reading
some
of
these
cases--
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
--and,
your
honor,
in
--
in
ten
of
those
cases
the
officers
were
searching
the
vehicle
when
they
escaped.
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
and
that
was
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
--
is
there
is
going
to
be
--
security
is
a
matter
of
degree.
is
the
arrestee
sufficiently
secured
if
he
is
arrested
and
standing
next
to
the
vehicle?
is
he
sufficiently
secured
if
he
is
cuffed
and
--
and
removed
10
feet
away?
is
he
sufficiently
secured
if
he
is
in
the
patrol
car?
we
--
in
belton
this
court
wanted
to
do
away
with
those
nuances
and
have
just
a
straightforward--
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
--certainly,
in
--
in
the
case
of
an
automobile,
which
is
different
from
the
chimel
home
situation,
if
a
vehicle
is
being
left
there.
in
this
case
the
gun
was
on
the
front
passenger
seat
of
the
vehicle.
someone
could
readily
access
it.
that's
always
true
with
an
automobile.
officers
obviously
could
take
some
steps
to
try
and
secure
the
vehicle,
lock
it
up
or
what-not.
but
that's
not
going
to
guarantee
the
fact
that
--
that
the
weapon
or
destructible
evidence
won't
be
tampered
with
by
either
other
co-occupants
who
the
officers
have
no
justification
to
arrest
and
secure
or
other
people
in
the
area.
so--
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
--in
this
case
the
police
impounded
the
car,
but
that
was
only
because
after
they
did
the
belton
search,
they
found
drugs.
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
it
depends
on
the
department.
some
departments
would
simply
lock
it
up
and
leave
it
there.
other
departments
would
impound
it
and
do
an
inventory
search
of
the
contents
which
obviously
they
would
find
anything
that
happened
to
be
in
there
during
the
course
of
the
inventory
search.
now,
in
this
particular
case
it
was
unusual
because
the
vehicle
was
actually
pulled
in
the
driveway
of
a
house,
so
the
officers
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
testified
that
had
they
not
found
the
drugs
in
the
vehicle
they
would
not
have
impounded
it,
because
again
it
was
on
private
property
and
they
would
have
had
no
real
reason
to
do
it.
quite
simply
there
is
no
special
justification
for
this
court
to
overrule
belton.
nothing
has
changed
in
the
past
27
years
to
call
belton
into
question.
the
same
complaints
we
hear
voiced
by
defendants,
legal
commentators
and
some
judges
are
the
same
complaints
voiced
by
justice
brennan
in
his
dissent
in
belton
as
well
as
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
in
people
v
belton.
the
court
considered
everything,
made
a
policy
decision
based
on
reasonableness
that
--
that
--
that
officer
safety--
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
--right.
that
--
that
came
into
fruition
in
--
in
thornton
and
--
and
of
course
in
this
case
gant
is
a
--
as
recent
as
a
recent
occupant
can
be.
he
literally
was
stepping
out
of
the
car
when
the
officer
summoned
him
and
he
knew
the
officers
were
there
because
they
flashed
a
flashlight
in
his
face
as
he
drove
by
three
--
three
feet
from
them.
police
officers
have
been
trained
under
belton
for
the
past
27
years.
they
have
applied
it
in
the
field.
it
would
be
an
undue
burden
to
have
to
retrain
those
officers
and
--
and
for
them
to
determine
under
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis
when
they
can
and
when
they
can't
conduct
searches
of
automobiles
incident
to
arrest.
they
wouldn't
know
their
authority;
citizens
wouldn't
know
the
scope
of
their
fourth
amendment
protection.
additionally
as
we
pointed
out,
an
overwhelming
majority
of
states,
41,
have
followed
belton
and
a
few
of
those
have
even
done
so
under
their
own
state
constitutional
search
and
seizure
provisions
and
of
course
they
all
had
the
opportunity
to
opt
out
but
they
obviously
believed
belton
is
a
workable
rule
that
promotes
officer
safety
and
only
has
a
minimal
impact
on
the
privacy
interests
of
the
recent
occupant
of
an
automobile.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions
i'll
retain
whatever
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
t.
maziarz
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i'll
waive
rebuttal.
