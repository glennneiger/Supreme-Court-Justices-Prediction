we'll
hear
argument
next
in
kennedy
v.
plan
administrator
for

and

mr.
furlow.
i'm
sorry.
we
won't.
[laughter]
it's
still
early
in
the
term.
case
07-542,
arizona
v.
gant.
mr.
maziarz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
you
don't
have
--
i
thought
the
whole
point
of
a
bright-line
rule
is
that
you
don't
have
to
justify
in
every
particular
case
applying
the
--
the
rule.
so
you
are
certainly
going
to
--
if
you
--
the
point
is
if
you
have
a
fact
case-by-case
inquiry,
you're
giving
up
the
bright-line
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
yang
--
mr.
maziarz.
now
mr.
yang,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
yang.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
jacobs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you're
looking
at
the
specific
facts
of
belton.
belton
adopted
a
bright-line
rule.
the
whole
point
of
a
bright-line
rule
is
that
you
don't
look
at
the
specific
facts
and
it
presents
a
problem
here
you
say
the
guy
is
handcuffed
and
in
the
back
of
the
car?
well
what
if
he
is
just
handcuffed
but
not
in
the
back
of
the
car,
what
if
he
is
in
the
back
of
the
car
but
not
handcuffed?
what
if
there
are
five
people
around
who
might
break
open
the
police
car
and
free
him?
what
if
there
are
three
people
around?
you
have
exactly
the
same
case
by
case
inquiry
that
belton
said
we
are
not
going
to
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--was
that
all
pre-belton?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
one
is
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
those
all
pre-thornton.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
the
point
is
that
in
thornton
of
course
the
guy
was
handcuffed
in
the
back
of
the
police
car
and
we
no
less
applied
belton.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
my
question
is
what
is
left
of
the
belton
bright-line
rule
if
you
prevail.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
now
we
have
got
to
have
a
case
by
case
inquiry
to
determine
whether
there
is
actually
in
that
case
a
threat
to
officer
safety.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--except
if
you're
wrong,
stare
decisis
comes
into
play
only
assuming
the
decision
is
wrong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
not
to
get
back
--
mincey
was
1978.
belton
was
1981.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
i'm
trying
to
see
--
you
cited
three
cases.
and
my
question
was
whether
those
survived
belton.
now,
were
all
three
of
those
before
belton?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
explore
that,
that
does
seem
to
me
to
be
overruling
belton
to
the
extent
belton
adopted
a
bright-line
rule.
what
you're
saying
is,
well,
in
these
circumstances
belton
applies,
and
in
these
circumstances,
it
doesn't.
but
you're
overruling
belton
when
you
say
there's
no
longer
a
bright-line
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
after
belton
--
you
think
after
belton,
we
still
have
to
look
and
see
what's
reaching
distance
on
a
case-by-case
basis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
that
part:
"arguably
within
the
reach".
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
part
of
belton.
i
thought
that's
what
belton
did
away
with,
and
thought
belton
was
saying,
look,
we
are
going
to
have
a
bright-line
rule,
because
we
don't
want
to
say
he's
five
feet
away,
he
is
not
within
the
reach;
two
feet
away,
he
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
belton
kept
the
requirement
that
the
person
be
arguably
within
the
reach
of
the
compartment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
maziarz,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-542,
arizona
versus
gant.
