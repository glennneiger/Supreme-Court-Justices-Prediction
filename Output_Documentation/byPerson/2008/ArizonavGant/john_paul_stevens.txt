paul

something
was
happening
back
there.
the
automobile
exception
is
much
older
than
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
automobile
exception
is
much
older
than
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
you
know,
the
automobile
exception
could
provide
a
rationale
that
would
cover
all
of
these
cases.
do
you
remember
my
opinion
in
belton?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
for
officer
safety
when
the
defendant
is
no
longer
in
the
car
and
is
under
--
under
the
control
of
the
officer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
are
not
the
facts
of
belton.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
asking
for
the
expanded
belton
rule,
not
the
rule
of
belton
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
isn't
true
that
we
didn't
have
the
recent
occupant
problem
at
the
time
of
belton?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
the
rule
of
requiring
just
the
automobile
exception,
where
you
would
require
probable
cause
to
search
a
vehicle,
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
bright
line
rule
that
would
fit
into
everything
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
more
concerned
about
the
ability
to
search
the
vehicle
or
the
protection
of
the
officer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
--
don't
these
rules
apply
to
ordinary
traffic
arrests
where
there
really
is
very
little
risk
to
the
officer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
need
to
search
the
vehicle
is
primarily
justified
by
the
interest
in
officer
safety?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
interest
in
preserving
evidence
really
should
only
be
present
when
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
there
is
some
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
normally,
to
overcome
the
privacy
interest,
you
need
probable
cause.
and
you
did
need
probable
cause
for
the
automobile
exception
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
really
what's
at
stake
here
is
the
right
to
search
the
vehicle
for
things
that
are
not
right
out
in
front
at
the
time
he
does
the
custodial
arrest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
was
right
there,
obviously
he
had
a
right
to
search
the
whole
vehicle
under
the
automobile
exception,
but
in
the
normal
case,
i
don't
see
why
officer
safety
is
an
adequate
justification
for
going
beyond
the
authority
that
it
would
have
under
the
automobile
exception.
that's
the
problem
i
have,
because
you
do
have
broad
authority
if
you
have
probable
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
chimel,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--underlie
ross.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
basic
question
is:
why
doesn't
that
different
doctrine
apply
the
bright-line
rule,
simply
administered,
that
you
need?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
one
of
the
really
contentious
issues
at
the
time
belton
decided
is
whether
you
can
search
containers
in
the
back
in
the
passenger
part
of
the
car.
and
under
the
automobile
exception,
you
could
search
those
containers
if
you
had
probable
cause
to
believe
anything
in
the
car
was
contraband.
and
that's
what
belton
really
opened
the
door
to,
was
container
searches.
it
was
not
just
searches
of
things
in
plain
view.
and,
of
course,
the
justification
for
suggesting
that
that's
too
broad
a
rule
is
the
very
strong
privacy
interest
in
containers
in
cars
driven
by
ordinary
motorists.
that's
really
what's
at
issue
under
belton.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
it
raises
an
important
fourth
amendment
issue.
acting
on
an
anonymous
tip
that
residents
in
tucson
was
being
used
to
sell
drugs,
two
police
officers
knocked
on
the
front
door
and
asked
to
speak
to
the
owner.
respondent
rodney
gant
answered
the
door
and
after
identifying
himself
stated
that
he
expected
the
owner
to
return
later.
the
officers
left
the
residence
and
conducted
a
records
check
which
revealed
that
gant's
driver's
license
had
been
suspended
and
there
was
outstanding
warrant
for
his
arrest
for
driving
with
the
--
on
a
suspended
license.
the
officers
returned
to
house
that
evening
and
recognized
gant
when
his
car
entered
the
driveway.
they
arrested
him,
handcuffed
him,
and
locked
him
in
the
backseat
of
a
squad
car.
two
officers
then
searched
his
car
and
discovered
a
bag
of
cocaine
in
the
pocket
of
the
jacket
on
the
backseat.
after
gant
was
changed
with
two
drug
offenses,
he
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
seized
from
his
car
on
the
ground
that
the
warrantless
search
was
unreasonable
because
he
posed
no
threat
to
the
officers
after
he
was
locked
in
the
back
of
the
patrol
car
and
because
he
was
arrested
for
a
traffic
offense
for
which
no
evidence
could
be
found
in
his
vehicle.
when
asked
at
the
suppression
hearing
why
the
search
was
conducted,
officer
griffith
responded,
“because
the
law
says
we
can
do
it.”
the
arizona
supreme
court
held
that
the
search
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
for
reasons
stated
at
length
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
agree
with
their
conclusion
and
we
affirm
their
judgment.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
in
full
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy
and
in
part
by
justice
breyer.
justice
breyer
has
also
filed
a
dissent.
