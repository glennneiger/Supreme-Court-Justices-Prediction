do
you
have
any
views
on
the
other
case?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
location.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
is
important,
but
you
had
three
--
three
points.
one
was
the
fact
of
the
arrest;
and,
two,
it
must
be
contemporaneous.
and
the
third?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
bright
line
swallows
up
the
rationale
in
this
hypothetical
where
already
he's
handcuffed;
he
is
in
the
car.
is
there
a
justification
apart
from
chimel
for
our
keeping
this
bright-line
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
other
--
are
there
other
reasons
that
it's
hazardous
or
dangerous
or
at
least
risky
to
leave
an
unattended
car
where
other
people
can
go
in
and
maybe
find
weapons
and
contraband
if
the
police
aren't
guarding
it?
i
mean,
are
there
other
reasons
other
than
chimel
for
this
bright-line
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
basis
for
your
wanting
us
to
adopt
what
we
might
call
a
bright-line
rule
for
automobile
exception?
what
are
the
reasons
other
than
officer
safety
which
we
think
may
not
be
a
very
persuasive
reason.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
keep
coming
back
to
danger.
and
let's
--
let's
assume
that
some
of
us
think
that
when
he
has
been
handcuffed
and
in
the
back
of
a
car
and
he
is
about
ready
to
leave
the
scene,
there
is
no
more
danger.
i
want
to
know
if
there
are
any
other
reasons
other
than
preserving
evidence
for
searching
the
car.
it
seems
to
me
there
are
good
reasons
for
searching
that
car.
it's
--
it's
movable.
that's
the
old
vehicle
exception.
it
can
have
contraband
in
it.
it
can
be
stolen.
it
can
be
taken
for
joy
rides.
but
you
don't
seem
to
make
any
of
those
arguments.
you
just
want
to
keep
coming
back
to
officer
safety
and
on
that
point
i
think
your
case
is
very
weak.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
fine,
if
you
want
to
go
back
to
that,
fine.
i
have
problems
with
the
argument
but
if
that's
your
argument
i'll
take
it
from
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
diminished
expectations
of
privacy
are
not
a
reason
to
search.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
only
reason
to
search
that
i
can
find
from
you
so
far
is
officer
safety.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
absence
of
dominion
or
control
works
the
other
way.
that
makes
it
all
the
more
dangerous.
that
could
be
--
there
could
be
guns
that
other
people
could
get
out,
evidence
other
people
could
get
out;
and,
rather
than
go
through
a
case-by-case
analysis
of
whether
this
was
true
in
every
case,
we
just
have
a
bright-line
rule
as
justice
scalia
said
at
the
outset.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
the
absence
of
the
dominion
and
control
is
--
is
just
a
conclusory
statement
to
explain
what
happens
in
the
case
the
person
is
arrested,
but
it
--
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
provide
a
rationale.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
actually
works
the
other
way,
because
it
means
there
is
more
reason
to
search.
it's
not
in
our
dominion
and
control.
we
are
leaving
it
on
the
street.
we
want
to
know
what's
in
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
is
what
they
are
asking
about
in
this
case.
