mr.
anthony
yang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
belton
relied
on
a
factor
that
was
not
in
chimel,
the
need
for
an
easily
administratable
rule
in
the
commonly
recurring
incident
of
vehicle
arrest
and
the
search
incident
to
that
arrest.
justice
stewart
who
authored
both
chimel
and
belton
recognized
that
over
a
decade
of
experience
of
chimel
had
shown
that
the
courts
were
in
disarray,
that
courts
had
confronted
similar
fact
circumstances
and
come
to
differing
results,
that
officers
in
the
field,
confronted
with
the
highly
volatile
and
dangerous
events
surrounding
a
custodial
arrest
needed
clear
guidance
to
be
able
to
govern
their
actions
in
these
instances.
that
makes
total
sense.
unlike
chimel
which
occurred
in
a
home
and
arises
in
a
situation
where
the
privacy
interests
are
at
their
apex,
in
the
belton
context,
the
search
is
of
the
passenger
compartment
of
a
vehicle,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
acknowledged
that
with
respect
to
automobiles
there
is
a
considerably
diminished
or
greatly
are
reduced
expectation
of
privacy.
given
the
very
real
threats
that
officers
face
in
discharging
their
duties
on
a
day-to-day
basis
in
this
commonly
recurring
scene
--
circumstances,
belton
established
a
bright-line
rule
to
be
able
to
govern
their
conduct.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
i
think
belton
--
when
belton
was
decided
there
was
some
question
in
terms
of
the
trunk
in
terms
of
this
court's
decision
in
sanders.
sanders
is
mentioned
in
belton.
there
hadn't
been
a
problem
with
a
bright-line
rule
with
respect
to
trunks
and
the
court
simply
didn't
--
didn't
address
it.
and
we're
not
in
this
case
seeking
an
expansion
of
belton,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
yang
certainly
in
another
case,
you
know,
the
court
can
revisit
the
scope
of
belton
but
i
think
belton
as
established
certainly
makes
sense
with
respect
to
the
ambit
of
the
passenger
compartment.
even--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
--
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
in
belton
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
a
portion
quoted
the
court
by
belton
had
determined
that
there
was
no
longer
any
danger
that
the
arrestees
could
get
to
the
vehicle,
and
in
fact
justice
brennan
emphasized
in
dissent
there
was
no
possibility
that
they
could
reach
passenger
compartment.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
the
--
related
to
officer
safety
is
the
question
of
the
administrability
of
the
rule
in
these
highly
fluid
contexts.
the
officers
must
make
rapid
judgments
about
what
is
and
what
is
not
permissible
and
in
belton
the
court
recognized
that
a
rule
--
that
rules
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
which
require
all
kinds
of
ifs
ands
or
buts,
simply
are
not
workable;
and
that
had
been
borne
out
with
10
years
of
experience
with
chimel
being
applied
in
the
vehicle
context
and
belton.
mr.
anthony
yang
yes.
we
believe
the
bright-line--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
justice
souter
we
think
that
--
in
some
ways
that
does
have
the
benefit
of
a
bright-line
rule,
but
we
don't
believe
that
the
--
that's
a
question
of
where
you're
going
to
draw
that
line.
mr.
anthony
yang
we
actually
would
draw
the
line
a
little
closer
than
the
police
station.
it
would
be
when
the
--
the
search
has
begun
after
the
suspect
has
been
removed
from
the
scene.
but
in
terms
of
administrability
i
guess
that
would
provide
for
a
sufficiently
bright-line
rule
but
the
problem
is
drawing
the
line
at
that
point.
mr.
anthony
yang
it
is,
but
the
difference
between
the
probable
cause
exception
and
a
search
incident
to
arrest
is
a
search
incident
to
arrest
doctrine--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
certainly
the
protection
of
the
officer
is
what
motivates
the
doctrine.
mr.
anthony
yang
actually,
your
honor,
very
common-day
traffic
arrests
have
high
risk
to
the
officer
due
to
the
unknowns.
the
court
recognized
that
in
robinson,
robinson
which
established
the
bright-line
rule
for
search
of
the
person
was
in
fact
an
arrest
based
on
failure
--
driving
on
a
suspended
license.
the
court
has
in
chadwick
emphasized
that
all
custodial
arrests--
mr.
anthony
yang
--primarily,
but
also
the
interest
in
preserving
evidence.
when
a
suspect
is--
mr.
anthony
yang
--oh,
no;
when
a
suspect
is
put
under
custodial
arrest,
the
--
there
is
increased
incentive
both
to
escape,
to
get
weapons,
and
also
to
destroy
any
incriminating
evidence
that
might
be--
mr.
anthony
yang
--to
preserve--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
we
would
take
issue
with
respect
to
the
officer
safety.
mr.
anthony
yang
but
in
terms
--
in
terms
of
the
evidence
the
court
recognized
in
maryland
v--
mr.
anthony
yang
--the
court
recognized
in
maryland
v
wilson
that
when
you
pull
someone
over
for
a
traffic
stop,
there
is
a
risk
of
escalation
of
the
encounter
because
evidence
of
a
more
serious
crime
might
be
revealed
in
that
stop.
mr.
anthony
yang
no.
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
talking
about
is
the
--
the
danger
of
the
custodial
arrest
situation,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
on
the
point
of
officer
safety,
your
honor,
i
can
understand
the
court's
reluctance
to
think
that
a
person
handcuffed
in
a
car
is
likely
to
escape.
and
we
admit
that
the
occurrence
is
relatively
small.
it's
clear
that
a
person
handcuffed
in
the
back
of
a
patrol
car
escapes
the
car
dozens
of
times
a
year.
we
just
did
a
simple
search
on
the
internet--
mr.
anthony
yang
--but
the
point
is,
on
a
continuum,
belton
provides
an
administrable
rule
where
officers
in
the
field
can
guide
their
conduct.
there's
going
to
be
instances
in
which
the
risk
is
going
to
be
higher,
and
there's
going
to
be
instances
where
the
risk
is
lower.
and,
admittedly,
we
are
on
the
end
of
the
continuum,
but
it
--
belton
wanted
to
provide
a
rule
whereby
you
wouldn't
have
to
guess
in
these
circumstances.
certainly,
with
respect
to
the
privacy
interest
in
vehicles
as
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
privacy
interest
in
the
vehicle,
particularly
when
you've
been
arrested
and
could
be
--
for
a
traffic
violation--
mr.
anthony
yang
--in
terms
of
the
balancing
that's
conducted,
it
can
be
a
risk
to
officer
safety,
the
need
for
administrable
rule
balanced
against
the
privacy
interest.
here
the
privacy
interest
has
been
quite
diminished.
once
you've
been
arrested
on
the
street,
the
police
often
have
--
certainly
have
a
constitutional
ability
to
impound
the
car
and
conduct
an
inventory
search.
mr.
anthony
yang
it
was
in
a
private
house
owned
by
someone
else.
the
officers
testified
that
they
normally
would
not
tow
it
at
that
point,
but
certainly
they
would
have
had
the
constitutional
authority.
it
would
have
been
reasonable
for
officers
to
impound
the
car
that
was
not
at
the
residence
of
the
arrestee.
mr.
anthony
yang
correct,
which
underscores
the
diminished
privacy
interest
that
an
arrestee
would
have
in
the
contents
of
a
vehicle.
and--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
once
someone
has
been
arrested
and
if
it's
all-night
parking,
if
the
person
is
going
into
a
custodial
arrest,
going
to
jail
for
purposes
of
protecting--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
for
purposes
of
the
impound
and
inventory
search,
so
long
as
there's
a
reasonable
basis,
and
the
reasonable
basis
would
be
to
secure
the
vehicle
to
get
it
off
the
street
when
the
occupant
has
been
arrested
and
wouldn't
be
able
to
retrieve
it,
i
think--
mr.
anthony
yang
--it's
not
automatic,
but
it
does
go
against
the
expectation
of
privacy
that
one
has
in
the
personal
effects
in
the
vehicle,
and
is
greatly
diminished
because,
you
know,
the
state
--
i
believe
it
was
your
decision
in
wyoming
versus
houghton
--
the
state
regulates
cars
on
a
daily
basis.
they
inspect,
examine
the
vehicle.
so
when
we
are
talking
about
the
constitutional
balance--
mr.
anthony
yang
--correct,
but
what
it's
balanced--
mr.
anthony
yang
--officer
safety
and
the
need
for
an
administrable
rule,
which
is--
mr.
anthony
yang
--the
likelihood
of
that
event
occurring
is
relatively
small.
the
potential
risks
to
officers
are
great.
given
that
this
does
occur,
that
individuals
do
escape
from
vehicles,
and
--
here
the
vehicle,
the
police
vehicle,
was
parked
immediately
behind
the--
mr.
anthony
yang
--it
will
depend
on
the
circumstances,
your
honor.
sometimes--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
that's
exactly
the
point.
in
items
of
the
administrable
rule,
there's
all
kinds
of
stages
in
an
arrest,
which,
we'd
have
to
stop
and
say,
you
know,
is
it
going
to
be
--
is
he
arrested
--
is
there
one
officer,
or
are
the
three
suspects
--
are
they
handcuffed
in
front
or
are
they
handcuffed
in
back?
is
it
a
metal
handcuff?
is
it
a
plastic
handcuff?
is
it
night?
what's
the
surrounding
circumstances
in
terms
of
the
traffic
that
might
be
distracting
to
the
officer?
is
it
a
neighborhood
which
is
a
high-crime
neighborhood?
there's
all
kinds
of
things
that,
in
the
"totality
of
circumstances"
approach
the
arizona
supreme
court
adopted,
would
be
inadministrable
in
the
field.
and
the
court
recognized
that
in
belton,
and
in
fact
reaffirmed
that
in
thornton.
just
recently
the
court
explained
that
experiences
show
the
need
for
a
bright-line
rule
in
this
context.
mr.
anthony
yang
i--
mr.
anthony
yang
--i
doubt
that
--
the
hypothetical
that
someone--
mr.
anthony
yang
--we
think
that
that
would
be
the
exception.
it's
possible.
we
don't
think
that
would
happen
on
a
routine
basis,
and
certainly
police
departments
and
the
federal
government
would
not
encourage
our
officers
to
take
that
risk.
mr.
anthony
yang
custodial
arrests
are
dangerous
in
themselves,
and
this
is
one
step,
a
reasonable
step,
that
officers
can
take
to
secure
their
safety,
among
others,
in
the
instance
of
a
custodial
arrest
on
the
street.
mr.
anthony
yang
for
instance,
like
a
gun
right
underneath
the
seat,
which
would--
mr.
anthony
yang
--may
i?
mr.
anthony
yang
officer
safety
underlies
the
chimel
exception,
to
begin
with.
mr.
anthony
yang
and
chimel--
mr.
anthony
yang
--that's
correct,
but
it's
a
different
doctrine.
i'm
mean,
that's
about--
mr.
anthony
yang
--when
we're
talking
about
custodial
arrest,
there
are
unknown
risks.
if
there
are
unknown
risks,
officers
obviously
can't
have
probable
cause
to
believe
there
would
be
a
weapon
in
the
car.
and
that's
what
the
"search
incident
to
arrest"
doctrine
seeks
to
address.
mr.
anthony
yang
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
