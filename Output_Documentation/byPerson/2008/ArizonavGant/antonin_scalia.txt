justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
a
long
time.
what
--
what
was
the
situation
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted?
do
you
know?
if
you
stopped
thomas
jefferson's
carriage
to
arrest
thomas
jefferson
and
you
pulled
him
off
to
the
side
of
the
road,
could
you
--
could
you
then
go
and
search
his
carriage?
i'm
struck
by
the
fact
that
there
is
no
effort
in
your
brief
whatever
to
take
this
thing
back
any
more
than
27
years.
now,
you
know,
it
could
--
it
could
well
be
that
it
has
always
been
considered
reasonable
to
search
the
person
and
to
search
the
conveyance
from
which
the
person
has
been
taken.
if
that's
the
case,
i
could
say,
gee,
it's
always
been
considered
reasonable,
end
of
case.
but
--
but
you
--
you
give
me
nothing
to
hang
my
hat
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
reasonable
rule.
what
isn't
a
reasonable
rule
is
to
say
at
the
same
premises
as
long
as
the
officer
is
there
and
the
officer
is
at
risk.
i
mean
that
is
just
--
it's
just
silly.
it's
--
it's
simply
not
the
case.
and
--
and
if
you
bring
that
forward
as
the
justification
for
this
rule,
i'm
going
to
say,
you
know,
get
rid
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
realistically,
he
is
not
at
risk.
the
guy
is
handcuffed
in
the
police
cruiser,
and
so
i
want
to
go
and
search
his
car.
what
--
what
risk
to
the
officer
is
being
avoided?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't.
i'll
bet
you
that
in
most
of
those
cases
the
--
the
felon
got
out
the
other
--
other
door
of
the
car
while
the
policeman
was
searching
the
vehicle.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
once
you
--
once
you
eliminate
the
--
the
need
to
show
that
the
officer's
safety
was
threatened
why
--
why
would
you
limit
the
search
just
to
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
vehicle?
why
don't
you
let
him
search
the
trunk,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
--
i
know
you're
not
but
it
just
doesn't
make
sense
to
me
to
--
to
abandon
the
requirement
that
the
--
that
the
officer's
safety
be
threatened
and
yet
to
say
oh,
but
he
can
only
search
the
--
the
passenger
compartment.
if
indeed
there
is
reduced
expectation
of
privacy
for
the
automobile,
you
arrest
somebody
you
can
search
the
automobile;
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
arrested
this
guy
for
--
for
reckless
driving.
he
was
going
25
miles
over
the
speed
limit,
okay?
and
you're
going
to
search
his
car
for
evidence?
of
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
going
to
allow
the
search
nonetheless.
let's
assume
he
is
handcuffed
in
the
back,
so
officer
safety
is
not
at
issue;
but
you
say
we
want
to
be
able
to
search
a
car
for
evidence.
evidence
of
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
link
--
if
you're
going
to
use
that
rationale
you
have
to
link
the
reason
for
the
arrest
with
the
likelihood
that
there
would
be
any
evidence
found
in
the
car
that
would
support
the
arrest.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
so
--
so
you,
you
avowedly
say
that
once
you
arrest
somebody
you
can
rummage
around
for
evidence
of
a
different
crime,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
can
they
impound
it?
suppose
they
stop
and
he
pulls
over
to
the
side
of
the
street
where
there
is
parking,
all-night
parking.
what
authority
would
they
have
to
drag
that
car
away?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
says,
"let
me
lock
my
car".
you
know,
"i
park
it
on
the
street
all
the
time.
"
"it's
a
lousy
car
any
way.
"
"nobody
wants
to
steal
it.
"
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
see
some
situations
where
--
where,
for
public
safety
or
other
reasons,
you
have
to
remove
the
car
from
where
it
is,
and
i
guess
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
drag
it
off
to
the
police
impoundment
yard.
but
in
other
situations,
i
--
you
speak
so
blithely
of
impoundment
as
though
--
as
though
that's
an
automatic
remedy.
i
just
don't
know
that
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
a
fine-line
rule.
i
mean
--
and
you
can
instruct
all
the
police
officers
in
your
department,
when
you
arrest
somebody,
have
them
stand
right
near
the
car
while
you
search
it.
okay?
make
sure
that
he's
near
enough
that,
you
know,
he's
a
threat
to
your
safety.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
certainly
a
bright-line
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
is
that
so
for
searches
of
the
vehicle?
when
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
so
for
search
of
the
person?
i
mean,
if
the
police
arrest
mother
teresa,
they
are
still
entitled
to
frisk
her,
right,
even
though
there's
little
likelihood
that
she
has
a
gatt?
[laughter]
what
--
if
--
if
we
don't
apply
the
officer
safety
rationale
to
searches
of
the
person,
no
matter
how
elderly,
how
eminent,
how
virtuous
the
person
is,
you
can
frisk.
we're
obviously
not
applying
the
officer
safety
rule
across
the
board.
we're
adopting
a
bright-line
rule
that
obviously
applies
to
many
situations
in
which
the
officer
is
not
at
risk.
why
can't
you
do
the
same
for
automobiles?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
--
what's
the
history
there?
do
you
know
the
history
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
thomas
jefferson's
conveyance--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
is
not
much
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
not
much
there.
