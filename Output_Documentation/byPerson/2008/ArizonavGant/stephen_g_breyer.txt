where
--
where
is
it?
i
mean,
if
you
want
to
--
if
you
want
to
search,
you
can
impound
the
car.
if
you
want
to
search,
you
can
ask
for
consent,
which
you
probably
won't
get.
if
you
want
to
search,
you
can
look
in
the
window.
there's
no
problem
there.
it's
just
under
the
seat
and
in
the
glove
compartment
we're
talking
about.
if
you
have
probable
cause
to
think
that
there's
evidence
of
a
crime
even
in
the
glove
compartment
or
underneath
the
seat,
you
can
look
at
it
without
a
warrant.
why
do
you
need
this
as
well?
you
say
we
need
this
as
well
because
the
guy
who's
locked
up
in
back
of
the
squad
car
might
take
off
the
handcuffs,
open
the
door,
run
out,
and
grab
a
gun
from
under
the
glove
compartment.
that's
a
little
thin.
and
then
you
say,
well,
the
rule
is
it
needs
to
be
administrable.
and
then
i
say,
okay,
the
rule
is
administrable
if
you've
got
him
locked
up
in
the
squad
car
and
all
you
want
to
do
is
have
a
good
snoop
around,
take
it
in
and
impound
it.
that's
administrable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
got
that
point.
are
there
many
people,
by
the
way,
they
arrest
but
they
leave
them
standing
outside
the
squad
car?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
are
we
going
to
have
one
of
these
spectrum
things?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
actually
a
serious
point,
maybe
in
your
favor
because
it
--
what
was
worrying
me
about
this
is,
if
you
lose
the
case,
there
would
be
policemen
who
would
then
let
dangerous
people
stay
in
the
car
so
they
could
search
it.
but
you
haven't
made
that
argument,
and,
you
know,
that
would
be
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
nobody
would.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
i
mean
i
don't
know
if
it
can
go
off
on
that.
the
--
it
seems
to
me
i
--
i
thought
when
i
looked
through
this,
which
was
quickly,
it
seemed
to
me
everyone
was
assuming
that
it's
contemporaneous.
of
course,
if
it
isn't
contemporaneous,
that's
a
new
world,
and
maybe
you
would
win
on
that.
i
don't
know.
but
don't
we
have
to
for
present
purposes
take
it
as
a
contemporaneous
search,
which
i
think
is
what
the
lower
courts
found?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
sure
there
are,
but
what
is
your
opinion?
i
mean,
is
there
some
reason
what
i
have
been
doing
--
you
can
tell
me
--
i
am
finding
this
case
very,
very
difficult.
and
i
am
not
at
all
certain
in
my
own
mind,
and
i
am
being
quite
frank
with
you.
and
the
reason
is
that
although
i
don't
think
belton
is
very
logical,
it
has
been
the
law
for
27
years;
and
i
take
very
seriously,
as
we
all
do,
the
principle
of
stare
decisus.
that
is
why
your
response
to
justice
alito
really
sort
of
shook
me.
because
i
was
thinking,
one,
i
have
to
take
this
as
contemporaneous;
and
i
have
to
run
squarely
into
the
problem
that
for
some
period
of
years
belton
has
been
the
law
and
maybe
even
before
belton.
i
don't
know
about
thomas
jefferson's
automobile.
but,
nonetheless,
no
disaster
has
occurred,
and
so
why
would
we
overrule
an
earlier
case?
now
that's
--
that's
exactly
my
problem.
and
so
if
you
were
interested
in
that,
you
have
to
give
me
an
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
are
you
saying
do
you
have
any
in
my
own
mind
perhaps
differently
from
you
i
think
that
the
stare
decisus
is
really
brought
into
play
when
you
think
the
earlier
decision
was
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
at
that
point
i'd
still
need
a
reason
why
you
should
depart
from
that
earlier
decision
at
the
moment
what
the
other
side
says
is
we
tell
our
police
a
simple
thing.
we
tell
them
when
you
arrest
somebody
who
is
in
a
car
you
can
search
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
car
okay.
simple.
and
we've
trained
a
hundred
thousand
police
officers
to
do
that
and
they
do
it.
now,
is
there
some
indication
that
that's
turned
out
to
be
abusive?
is
there
indication
that
there
are
other
problems
with
the
rule,
has
it
turned
out
to
be
complicated?
what
kinds
of
things
you
could
say
that
will
overcome
what
i'm
putting
forth
as
a
kind
of
reluctance.
