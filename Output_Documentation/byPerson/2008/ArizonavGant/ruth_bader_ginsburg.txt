but
not
if
it
occurred
in
the
station
house,
right,
if
the
--
if
the
arrestee
had
been
taken
into
the
station
house?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
isn't
this
situation
more
like
the
station
house
than
it
is
like
--
the
belton
situation
is
the
police
apprehend
the
--
a
driver.
they
are
concerned
about
weapons,
about
being
assaulted.
but
here
we
have
someone
who
is
locked
up
inside
a
police
car,
handcuffed,
can't
go
anywhere.
that
sounds
to
me
more
like
the
station
house
than
it
does
the
urgent
situation
where
the
police
have
a
legitimate
concern
for
their
own
safety.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happens
to
this
car?
now,
we
had
no
passengers,
just
the
driver.
he
is
put
away
in
this
squad
car,
so
he
is
not
going
to
drive
that
car
home.
what
happens
to
the
car?
let's
say
there
was
no
search.
the
car
is
there.
it
has
no
driver.
what
do
the
police
do
with
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
suppose
they
didn't?
suppose
they
said,
well,
he
is
secure;
he
is
no
danger
to
us,
so
we
are
not
going
to
search
the
car
without
a
warrant.
what
--
what
happens
to
the
car?
it
just
doesn't
stay
there
stranded
on
the
road,
does
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
belton,
wasn't
the
notion
what
was
within
grabbing
distance?
and
the
trunk
wasn't
within
grabbing
distance.
that
was
--
and
here
nothing
is
within
grabbing
distance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
they
have
impounded
this
car?
i
thought
they
didn't
have
grounds
to
impound
it
because
it
was
--
we
were
just
told
it
was
parked
in
an
alley
of
a
private
house.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
they
could
have
impounded,
and
then
could
they
have
done
an
inventory
search?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
not
asking
to
overrule
belton;
you
are
asking
to
take
it
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
presented,
where
there
was
genuine
concern
for
officer
safety.
is
that--
