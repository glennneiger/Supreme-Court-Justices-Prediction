justice

but
don't
you
have
to
show
that
there
are
special
circumstances
here
justifying
the
overruling
of
belton?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
is
this
a
fair
summary
of
the
holding
of
belton:
when
a
police
officer
has
made
a
lawful
custodial
arrest
of
the
occupant
of
an
automobile,
he
may
as
a
contemporaneous
incident
of
that
arrest
search
the
passenger
compartment
of
that
automobile?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
that
rule
is
applied
in
this
case,
you
would
lose;
would
you
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
does
contemporaneous
have
to
do
with
officer
safety?
it
has
to
do
with
timing,
doesn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let's
say
when
an
arrest
is
made,
25
swat
team
officers
are
there.
the
person
arrested
is
a
person
of
slight
stature.
they
immediately
descend
on
this
person
and
manacle
the
person
in
every
possible
way,
but
it's
all
done
in
10
seconds.
is
that
not
contemporaneous?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
they
immediately
search.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
immediately
they
search.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
bright-line
rule
is
set
out
in
one
sentence
which
is
the
sentence
that
i
read
to
you
but
if
you
just
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
in
order
to
prevail,
in
order
for
you
to
prevail
belton
has
to
be
overruled.
what
is
your,
what's
the
justification
for
overruling
belton?
is
it,
has
there
been
no
reliance
on
it,
is
the
belton
rule
less
workable
than
the
rule
that,
the
case
by
case
rule
that
you're
proposing,
is
it
undermined
by
subsequent
developments
and
precedent
or
does
stare
decisus
simply
not
count
in
these
constitutional
cases.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
enough
if
we
think
belton
was
wrong
that's
enough
for
overruling
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
the
situation
where
there
are
multiple
occupants
but
there's
probable
cause
to
arrest
only
one
of
the
occupants?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
going
to
be
--
aren't
cases
like
that
going
to
be
difficult
calls
as
to
whether
there's
officer
safety
concerns?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
one
person
is
arrested,
three
people
who
were
occupants
are
not
arrested.
they
are
all
out
by
the
side
of
the
car.
one
of
them
is
in
handcuffs.
three
of
them
are
not
arrested,
not
in
handcuffs.
there's
no
danger
of
officer
safety
there
--
three
people?
