chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-610,
locke
v.
karass.
mr.
young.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
--
even
though
there
may
be
a
great
disconnect
between
the
premiums
and
the
needs
of
the
particular
unit?
i
mean,
let's
say
the
particular
unit
has
--
i
don't
know
--
has
always
had
a
history
of
good
relations
with
the
employer.
it
has
never
had
to
call
upon
litigation
in
20
years,
and
they
don't
anticipate
it,
and
yet
their
insurance
premiums
rise
dramatically
because
of
very
hostile
and
extended
litigation
by
another
unit.
do
you
--
do
you
concede
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
is
not
trying
to
help
you.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
the
distinction
you
were
drawing
was
whether
or
not
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
applies
to
the
particular
union.
if
it's
a
different
unit
with
a
different
agreement
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
that
can't
be
charged,
but
if
it's
the
bargaining
agreement
that
binds
the
particular
unit,
i
thought
you
said
that
was
chargeable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
the
particular
unit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
suppose
you
would
also
concede
that
if
the
bargaining
agreement
is
exactly
the
same,
you
know
a
number
of
units
have
exactly
the
same
bargaining
agreement,
which
i
would
suppose
is
a
not
uncommon
situation,
but
litigation
with
respect
to
the
terms
of
the
bargaining
agreement
even
though
it
happens
to
involve
a
different
unit
is
also
chargeable
to
the
particular
unit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel.
mr.
collins?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
not
what
we
are
talking
about.
it
doesn't
have
to
go
it
alone.
it
simply
can't
force
members
of
another
unit
that
can
decide
they
are
happy
to
support
it
but
the
members
who
don't
want
to
support
it
who
don't
like
unions,
they
can't
be
forced
to
pay
for
it
if
it
does
not
relate
to
their
collective
bargaining
agreement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
litigation
is
not
germane
to
the
unit
where
people
object
to
that
unit's
collective
bargaining
agreement
they
are
not
free
riding
on
anything.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
there
is
no
--
i
guess
i'm
getting
into
the
solicitor
general's
position
here.
what
if
the
unit
with
the
objecting
members
does
not
have
a
right
to
call
upon
the
pool?
either,
or
has
never
called
upon
the
pool
and
it's
unlikely
that
it
will.
isn't
there,
it's
not
simply
subsidization.
it's
their
compelled
fees
being
used
for
something
that
doesn't
benefit
their
collective
bargaining
arrangement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly
--
i'm
sorry.
i
was
just
going
to
say
exactly
so
i
regard
that
issue
as
still
open.
it
was
not
addressed
at
all
in
lehnert.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
have
a
situation
where
there
is
a
provision
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
the
union
thinks
requires
the
employer
to
provide
air
conditioning
in
the
plant,
the
local
up
in
nome,
alaska
has
to
support
that
extra
--
extra-unit
litigation
even
though
it
will
never
have
any
benefit
for
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
it
meant
--
i
didn't
think
lehnert
held
that
the
unit
would
have
to
support
that
type
of
extra-unit
litigation.
i
mean,
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
yes,
there
is
a
provision
that
is
ambiguous,
which
frequently
happens,
and
the
union
says
that
requires
air
conditioning,
and
the
company
says
no,
and
there
is
a
big
fight
about
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
sure,
because
that
negotiation
is
germane
to
the
nome,
alaska
collective
bargaining
agreement,
if
they
are
negotiating
it
there
for
that
unit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
as
a
covenant
of
support
you
have
--
however
many
--
about
a
thousand
individual
units.
you
think
each
of
those,
you
have
a
covenant
to
support
them
when
they
all
get
--
get
involved
in
separate
litigation?
you
can't
possibly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
quite
unlike,
for
example,
insurance.
if
you
have
insurance
and
you
as
the
unit
have
a
particular
obligation,
you
have
a
right
to
have
that
covered.
there
is
no
similar
right
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
are
talking
about
an
infringement
on
the
objecting
members'
first
amendment
rights,
and
your
answer
is
trust
us,
we'll
treat
you
fairly?
i
understand
that
it's
a
different
answer
if
you
say
you've
got
a
right.
we
can
impose
the
contribution
requirement
on
you,
even
though
you
object
to
it
because
under
this
agreement,
you
have
a
right
to
call
upon
our
services.
that's
a
different
case.
but
if
your
answer
is
simply
trust
us
we'll
treat
you
fairly,
that's
not
the
usual
standard
we
apply
to
infringements
of
first
amendment
rights.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
different.
that's
a
little
bit
more
stringent
than
saying
trust
us.
that's
saying
let's
look
at
the
last
year
and
we'll
figure
it
out.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
we
determine
as
a
matter
of
first
amendment
law
that
such
a
requirement
is
necessary,
then
you
lose,
because
you're
saying
we
can't
possibly
fashion
the
test?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
lehnert
didn't
address
the
question
of
litigation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
not
right.
again
we
have
to
postulate
that
we
are
dealing
with
nonmembers
who
don't
like
unions
at
all.
so
while
the
members
may
think
this
is
perfectly
fair,
the
nonmembers
whenever
their
money
is
forced
to
be
used
for
union
activities,
it's
unfair.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
collins.
mr.
young,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
test
is
not
whether
it's
political,
is
it?
it's
not
a
negative
test.
it's
an
affirmative
requirement
in
which
the
burden
is
on
the
union
that
they
have
to
show
the
expenditure
is
germane
to
the
particular
collective
bargaining
agreement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
do
you
have
a
response
to
justice
kennedy's
concern?
do
you
have
a
fallback
position
or
are
you
also
in
the
all
or
nothing--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
07-610,
locke
versus
karass.
