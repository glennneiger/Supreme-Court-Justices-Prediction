mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
this
court
in
abood
described
the
kinds
of
expenditures
that
bargaining
agents
are
are
required
to
engage
in
and
that
necessitate
a
rule
that
requires
all
represented
employees
including
objecting
nonmembers
to
pay
their
share
services
of
lawyers
is
what
the
court
first
mentioned.
the
single
narrow
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
local
bargaining
agent
that's
confronted
with
the
need
to
pay
for
those
services
of
lawyers
to
draw
upon
legal
expertise
in
bargaining
related
matters
is
required
to
go
it
alone
rely
solely
on
its
open
resources
and
its
own
expertise
or--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--but
the
question
mr.
chief
justice
whether
that,
i
should
add
if
that
unit
wants
to
not
neither
go
it
alone
nor
give
a
free
ride
to
objecting
nonmembers
can
they
avail
itself.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
they
are
free
riding
on
the
same
thing
that
lehnert
says
they
cannot
free
ride
on.
lehnert
as
mr.
young
acknowledges
certainly
holds
that
as
a
general
proposition
when
a
local
union
bargaining
agent
is
determining
how
to
finance
germane
expenditures
that
it
will
incur
germane
to
its
unit,
it
can
either
obviously
go
it
alone
rely
on
its
own
resources
or
it
can
enter
into
an
affiliation
relationship
where
it
will
pay
an
affiliation
fee
the
--
of
which
will
be
measured
by
the
total
chargeable
expenditures
incurred
by
the
national
union
in
other
bargaining
units
as
well
as
when
it's
the
local's
own
unit.
what
lehnert
teaches
is
that
that
situation
cannot
fairly
be
described
as
requiring
the
objective
nonmember
to
subsidize
other
units.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
there
are
three
problems
with
that
contention
by
the
solicitor
general
which
the
petitioners
have
adopted
for
the
first
time
in
their
reply
brief.
the
first
problem
was
precisely
that.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it's
not
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
second
problem
is
i
should
add
it's
not
been
raised
in
any
other
post
lehnert
case
and
i
think
the
reason
this
issue
is
not
being
raised
is
it's
understood
i
think
correctly
that
lehnert
itself
did
not
solve
a
situation
where
the
kind
of
showing
that
the
solicitor
general
and
now
with
the
petitioners
would
require.
in
lehnert
where
this
court
did
approve
pooling
of
a
wide
range
of
expenses
the
court
simply
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
union
in
that
case
had
a
unified
membership
structure
which
as
the
court
put
it
under
which
so
many
unions
operate
and
the
court
talked
about
the
essence
of
an
affiliation
relationship
between
that
locals
can
draw
on
international
for
services
but
there
was
no
record,
this
was
no
showing,
this
was
no
finding,
there
was
no
discussion
of
any
notion
that
that
local
union
in
lehnert
had
an
enforceable
right
for
any--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--it
was
raised
in
the
reply
brief
in
lehnert.
the
petitioners
in
lehnert
complained
that
a
problem
with
pooling
is
that
there
are
no
guarantees
and
no
standards.
that
--
that's
why
there's
a
discussion
that's
reflected
in
justice
scalia's
separate
opinion,
a
discussion
of
the
fact
that
it
was
acknowledged
that
there
is
no
contractual
relationship,
but
that
there
were
certain
customs
and
--
and
practices.
but
there
was
no
evidence
and
certainly
no
determination
by
this
court--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--what
--
what
the
court
meant
by
that,
i
believe,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
--
well,
look
at
the
examples
the
court
gave
of
what
does
not
--
or
the
court
referred
to
certain
kinds
of
payments
a
local
union
could
make
which
are
not
part
of
an
affiliation
fee
payment.
the
court
talks
about
direct
payments
to
other
locals.
the
court
--
the
other
example
given
was
a
payment
to
a
--
a
national
union
that
wasn't
required
by
affiliation
but
was
like
a
charitable
contribution.
what
the
court
did
not
dispute
in
lehnert
is
that,
to
the
extent
that
an
affiliation
fee
is
providing
a
pool
of
resources
used
by
the
national
union
for
otherwise
chargeable
services,
the
potential
availability
of
those
services
does
satisfy
the
inurement
requirement.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
if
it
were
a
special
assessment
for
a
specific
purpose,
i
think
under
--
it
is
not
embraced
by
lehnert's
rationale.
it
might
not
well
not
be
chargeable,
because
what
lehnert
--
lehnert
does
not
arise
in
a
vacuum.
lehnert
talks
about
the
typical
affiliation
fee
relationship.
and
there
have
been
various
submissions,
treatise
articles
about
that.
so
the
notion
is
that
a
national
union
charges
an
affiliation
fee
for
all
of
the
various
services
it
provides,
and
local
unions
can
draw
upon
those
resources
as
needed.
if
you
then
talk
about
a
special
assessment--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--i
think
not,
your
honor,
for
--
for
two
reasons.
first,
i
do
think
that
lehnert
did
approve--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--not
beyond
--
and
again
the
question
isn't
presented,
but
not
beyond
what
lehnert
found
necessary.
lehnert
found
it
important
--
and
i
would
say
necessary
to
its
decision
--
that
the
union
in
that
case
had
what
lehnert
described
as
a
typical,
unified,
membership-affiliation-fee
arrangement;
and
it
talks
about
a
typical
affiliation
fee
where
locals
pay
money
to
go
to
the
pools
of
otherwise
chargeable
expenditures
of
the
national
union.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
just
as
lehnert
plainly
holds
that
local
would
have
to
support
the
negotiation
of
that
provision
in
the
first
place
in
nome,
alaska.
that's
the
holding
of
lehnert.
the
question
is
whether
litigation
is
different,
and
there
is
no
way
that
litigation
is
different
in
any
principled
way
as
relates
to
the
ruling.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
well,
i
may
have
misconstrued
your
--
it
was
litigation
over--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--well,
i
think
my
answer
is
still
correct,
your
honor.
lehnert
does
not
hold
--
well,
it
does
not
provide
the
answer
as
to
litigation;
but
lehnert
says
if
the
union
in
the
first
instance
says
we
want
to
go
to
nome,
alaska
and
negotiate
something
about
air
conditioning,
that
that,
even
though
it
only
affects
the
unit
in
nome,
alaska,
becomes
part
of
the
pool
of
chargeable
expenditures
that
all
units
can
be
part
of.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
but
the
litigation
is
equally
germane.
petitioners
do
not
dispute
that
litigation
can
be
germane
and
chargeable
within
a
particular
unit.
they
acknowledge
that;
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
so
both
the
negotiation
of
the
air
conditioning
right
in
nome,
alaska
and
the
enforcement
of
that
negotiated
agreement
through
litigation
are
equally
germane
within
the
unit;
the
same
interests
are
involved--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
want
to
make
clear
when
the
court
spoke
in
lehnert
of
the
essence
of
an
affiliation
agreement,
an
affiliation
agreement
is
a
contractual
relationship.
we
would
certainly
view
that
as
creating
a
covenant
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
that
the
national
union
will
deal
fairly
with
its
various
units.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
that's
correct,
and
it's
actually
quite
analogous
in
that
regard
to
the
duty
of
fair
representation
that,
let's
say
an
unaffiliated
local
union
owns
to
its
objecting
nonmembers.
the--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--no,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
i
said
was
a
covenant
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing.
and
that--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
first
amendment
does
not
create
a
rate
setting
rule
for
unions.
and
the
reason
for
that
is--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--no,
justice
souter.
i
would
not--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--that
the--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--yes.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
that
the
national
union--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--the
way
i
would
articulated
it,
and
then
i
would
like
to
take
a
step
backward
and
compare
it
to
the
nonaffiliated
situation.
i
would
articulate
it
as
follows,
that
there
is
no
any
first
amendment
requirement,
that
there
is
in
reality
in
the
affiliation
agreement
simply
a
covenant
of
good
faith
and
good
dealing
that
one
local
will
be
treated
with
respect
to
litigation
needs
as
others
would
be
treated.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
they
--
they
don't
have
a
first
amendment
obligation,
but,
your
honor,
that
is
true
in
the
case
of
agency
fees
all
together.
we
have
to
take
a
step
back
and
remember
that
we
are
trying
to
perform
an
exercise
the
court
has
said
can't
be
done
to
perfection
of
trying
to
distinguish
between
making
individuals
who
object
support
collective
bargaining
activities
not
support
other
things.
in
hudson
itself,
in
the
basic
situation
--
let's
assume
there
is
no
affiliation
agreement,
simply
a
local
union,
a
fee
is
charged
based
on
the
percentage
of
expenses
in
the
prior
year
that
went
for
chargeable
activities,
including,
let's
say,
litigation.
that
creates
no
guarantee
that
when
the
year
--
in
the
year
that
we
are
now
in,
when
fees
are
being
paid,
that
if
litigation
is
demanded,
requested
by
a
nonmember
or
anyone
else,
that
that
local
union
will
provide--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--i
think,
at
most,
the
obligation
is
parallel
to
the
duty
of
fair
representation
in
the
sense
that
the
entity
that's
responsible
for
determining
what
services
are
going
to
be
provided
to
the
employees
has
to
treat,
in
the
case
of
the
local
union
members
and
nonmembers
in
the
unity
plea,
in
the
case
of
the
national
union
it's
a
different
affiliated
entity
fairly
--
the
reason--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--but
i
have
two
answers
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
it
is
essentially
the
answer
that's
supplied
under
hudson,
where
the
court
says
simply
use
the
prior
year's
percentages.
we
don't
know
whether
this
year
we'll
have
the
same
percentage
breakdown.
we
also
don't
know
whether
this
year
the
union
will
have
enough
money
to
provide
any
particular
service
or
not.
but
we
don't--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--but
we
look
at
the
--
but
--
but
we
look
at
the
national
union
typical
affiliation
type
arrangement,
as
the
court
described
it
in
lehnert,
and
what
we
understand
is
this
is
a
union
that's
not
making
a
profit,
it's
not
piling
up
fees
and
putting
them
somewhere.
it
exists
to
provide
services
to
local
affiliates.
those
affiliates,
if
they
are
not
provided
with
services,
it's
not
just
the
nonmember,
the
objector
who's
being
harmed,
the
members
want
those
services
by
definition.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
absolutely,
your
honor,
that's
one
thing
a
national
union
can
properly
do.
another
thing
a
national
union
can
properly
do
is
to
say
we've
just
had
an
unexpected
economic
crisis,
all
of
a
sudden
midterm
we
have
to
change
our
priorities
and
we
are
going
to
have
to
protect
people
from
a
lot
of
layoffs.
but
the
second
point
i
want
to
make--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--what
--
the
value
the
--
the
objector
is
getting
is
not
have
a
guarantee
of
services.
he
has
the
potential
for
services
far
beyond
what
could
ever
be
paid
for
out
of
the
local's
own
affiliation
fees.
and
i
would
add
if
a
national
union
were
to
act
in
some
improper
way
in
terms
of
how
it
doles
out
assistance
--
and
by
the
way,
one
doesn't
see
cases
on
this,
it's
really
not
in
the
nature
of
how
national
unions
operate,
because
again,
we
are
talking
about
members
and
nonmembers
equally
in
terms
of
who's
going
to
get
benefits.
so
it's
not
a
problem
in
the
real
world
of
national
unions
treating
a
particular
local
unfairly
for
some
reason
and
not
giving
them
services
that
are
given
to
others.
there
are
certainly
a
lot
of
judgments
involved,
as
justice
ginsburg's
question
elicited.
but
if
a
national
union
were
to
treat
affiliates
unfairly,
it's
quite
possible
that
if
and
when
that
occurred,
that
it
might
have
implications
under
a
number
of
possible
causes
of
actions
and
including
possibly
the
right
to
object.
justice
scalia's
opinion
in
lehnert
noted
that
if
and
when
services
aren't
provided,
there
might
be
ground
for
objection.
the
question
here
is
is
this
a
basis
under
the
first
amendment
to
have
a
prophylactic
rule
that
says
we
are
so
concerned
that
even
though
we
have
no
rule
under
hudson
that
provides
assurance
that
an
unaffiliated
local
union
will
provide
any
particular
services
to
its
members
and
nonmembers,
we
have
such
a
concern
that
somehow
national
unions
won't
deliver
the
goods,
that
we
are
going
to
set
up
the
hierarchy
of
either
guarantees,
standards,
which
if
the
issue
had
been
presented
here
and
we
had
created
a
record,
we
would
show
the
court
--
i
think
no
union
in
this
country
has
and
for
good
reason,
both
because
of
the
virtual
infinitude
of
legitimate
factors
one
could
consider
also
because
of
the
constant
changes
in
needs
of
local
unions--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--because,
your
honor
--
and
the
reason
i
started
my
argument
by
saying
there
is
really
two
choices,
a
local
union
goes
it
alone
or
has
the
arrangement
that
we
have
here,
is
that
it
simply
would
not
be
possible
in
the
nature
of
things
to
have
a
set
of
standards
and
guarantees
that
would
be
meaningful
in
any
way
to
govern
how
national
unions
provide
services
to
locals.
a
standard
of
basic
fairness
and
equal
treatment
is
one
thing,
but
to
try
to
say
--
and
one
could
tick
off,
i
suppose,
50
things
we'll
consider.
we'll
consider
whether
it's
going
to
be
an
important
precedent,
whether
it's
the
kind
of
thing
a
local
can't
afford
on
its
own,
whether
it's
important
now
that
we
have
pressing
economic
problems
and
everyone
is
being
laid
off,
is
this
a
good
test
case
or
a
bad
test
case,
how
broad
will
the
implications
of
this
be.
one
could
list
50
factors,
but
they
wouldn't
guide
any
inquiry
in
a
meaningful
way.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
then
we
lose
and
so
does
the
union
in
lehnert
lose.
there
was
no
--
it
was
acknowledged
that
there
was
nothing
like
that.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
well,
but
if
--
but
there
has
been
no
argument
made
that
would
explain
why
if
you
--
if
one
can
pool
--
if
the
union
negotiates
an
agreement
with
a
very
controversial
provision
that
a
nonmember
has
a
very
legitimate
objection
to,
lehnert
holds
that
can
be
pooled.
lehnert
does
not
say
the
standard--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--i
have
two
responses
to
that,
justice
alito.
first,
the
--
if
one
had
to
have
the
kinds
of
either
guarantees
or
meaningful
enforceable
standards
that
are
implied
in
your
question,
then
in
the
nature
of
the
beast,
it
could
not
be
done
by
national
unions,
and
we
would
be
in
a
system
then
when
all
that
can
happen
is
that
a
local
union
has
to
rely
solely
on
its
own
resources,
solely
on
its
own
expertise.
and
it's
doing
that
despite,
as
judge
lynch
pointed
out
in
the
concurrence,
despite
the
dire
impact
that
can
have
on
its
ability
to
represent
people
and
it's
doing
it--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--well,
then
it
either
has
to
allow
for
--
the
union
has
to
either
conclude
we
are
going
to
support
all
of
our
germane
activities,
all
of
our
chargeable
activities
through
our
own
funding
and
our
own
resources,
and
if
that's
just
inadequate
and
therefore
litigation
needs
to
be
conducted,
we
can't
do
it;
the
employer
knows
that
so
it
can
take
advantage
of
us
in
bargaining;
we
are
just
going
to
have
to
live
with
it;
or
we
can
say
our
members
will
pay
for
that
but
the
nonmembers
won't,
because
the
only
solution
other
than
using
the
local's
own
money
is
to
pay
a
fee
to
the
national.
and
as
i've
indicated
in
lehnert
as
in
this
case,
the
arrangement
is
not
one
that
provides
guarantees--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--well--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--the
--
the
question,
justice
kennedy,
is
whatever
the
test
is
if
it's
satisfied
as
to
expenditures
within
the
unit
where
the
services
are
provided,
can
those
services
be
pooled
or
is
there
a
different
test
that
has
to
be
applied
to
the
pooling?
my
submission
is
that
lehnert
makes
clear
there
is
no
separate
test.
as
to
what
the
test
is
within
--
and
therefore,
as
to
the
question
presented
here,
one
doesn't
need
to
decide
on
the
actual
test
that
will
be
applied
within
the
local
because
as
your
separate
opinion
and
justice
scalia's
separate
opinion
in
lehnert
made
clear,
even
under
the
narrower
statutory
duties
test
there
could
still
be
pooling;
the
definition
as
to
what
can
be
pooled
would
simply
be
different.
i'd
only
note
on
the
question
of
whether
the
tests
should
be
germaneness
with
the
two
additional
prongs
as
held
in
lehnert,
or
the
statutory
duties
test,
that
again
is
a
question
that's
not
presented
here.
as
i
just
indicated
it
doesn't
affect
the
concept
of
pooling.
there
has
also
been
no
confusion,
contrary
to
petitioner's
contention,
under
the
lehnert
test.
the
only
issue
that's
given
the
courts
difficulties
is
the
specific
issue
here
as
to
why
the
plurality
in
lehnert
seemed
to
indicate
that
litigation
might
be
in
a
different
status
under
pooling.
so
there
is
no
basis
in
this
case
for
reconsidering
the
basic
lehnert
test
of
chargeability.
i
will
simply
note,
however,
that
the
statutory
duties
test
which
--
for
which
petitioners
argue
really
doesn't
make
the
situation
clearer
than
the
--
than
the
germaneness
test
because
the
government
--
both
the
germaneness
test
and
the
statutory
duties
test
acknowledge
that
the
union's
right
to
charge
objecting
nonmember
stems
from
its
function
as
exclusive
bargaining
representative;
but
there
is
no
way
to
sustain
logically
the
notion
that
that
means
that
only
those
things
that
are
done
in
that
exclusive
representative
capacity
are
chargeable;
because
the
same
government
interests
that
allow
for
charging
when
the
union
is
acting
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
have
to
also
allow
for
charging
for
those
things
that
are
necessary
in
order
for
the
union
to
play
that
role,
and
to
enforce
that
role
which
includes
things
like
the
headquarters;
it
includes
things
like
litigation
to
enforce
an
agreement,
even
though
in
those
areas
when
performing
those
functions,
the
union
very
often
does
not
have
an
exclusive
representational
duty
or
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
there
is
no
labor
department
regulation.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
no,
and
i--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--i
would
say
there
would
be
a
breach
of
covenant
of
faith
and
fair
dealing
under
the
affiliation
relationship
in
some
of
those
situations;
and
of
course
if
a
union
used
an
illegal
basis
for
determining
whether
it
would
provide
services
to
the--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--you
could
bring
a
lawsuit
alleging
that
the
union
violated
its
covenant
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
to
its
affiliates,
if
the
union
acted
on
the
basis
of
say,
race,
for
example,
you
could
certainly
bring
a
lawsuit
then.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
right.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
--
what
we
always
have
to
understand
here,
is
the
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
a
local
union
that
pays
an
affiliation
fee
will
receive
services
in
a
fair
way
from
the
national
is
an
interest
that's
shared
equally
by
the
members
and
the
nonmembers.
it's
not
something
that
creates
a
first
amendment
concern.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
but
a
--
a
member
equally
with
a
nonmember
would,
mr.
chief
justice,
have
the
view
that
if
it's
predictable
year
after
year
that
for
some
reason
his
local
doesn't
get
services
from
the
national
union,
the
national
union
sends
it
elsewhere,
that
member
is
going
to
be
no
more
happier
--
happy
than
the
nonmember.
that's
why
those
things
don't
happen
in
the
real
world.
that's
why
we
certainly
don't
need
a
prophylactic
rule
and
there
would
certainly
be
no
first
amendment
basis
for
a
prophylactic
rule
that
requires
the
union
to
establish
what
no
union
in
this
country
to
my
knowledge
has,
which
is
either
a
clear
guarantee
or
specific
standards
for
providing
services.
