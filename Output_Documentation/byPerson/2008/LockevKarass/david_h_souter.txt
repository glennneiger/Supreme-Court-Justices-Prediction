justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
take
--
do
you
take
that
as
--
as
--
as
meaning
that
the
union
couldn't
buy
litigation
insurance?
justice
david
h.
souter
some
of
those
--
some
of
those
premiums
are
going
to
subsidize
the
defense
in
--
in
--
in
cases
beyond
this
bargaining
unit.
in
fact,
most
of
it
will.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
--
so
in
your
view,
then,
even
if
the
agreement
with
the
--
with
the
parent
union
in
this
case
involved
an
explicit
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
parent
to
come
in
and
defend
in
--
if
litigation
arose
in
this
unit,
that
would
still
be
bad?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not
interested
in
insults.
is
it
--
is
it
constitutional,
or
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
--
and
--
and
--
and
you
do
take
the
position
that
a
--
a
genuine
insurance
policy
issued
by
an
insurer
would
not
violate
the
constitutional
standard?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
was
--
there
was
mutuality
of
obligation
in
the
hypothesis
that
i
gave
you
in
which
the
agreement
with
the
parent
union
required
an
affirmative
obligation
of
the
parent
union
to
come
in
and
defend
if
litigation
arose.
and
you
said
that
still
would
not
be
constitutional.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
--
so
the
criterion
has
got
to
be
something
other
than
mutuality
of
obligation,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
is
the
other
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
--
we
--
we
start
with
that
premise,
but
what
is
the
other
distinction,
then?
if
it
is
not
mutuality
of
obligation,
what
--
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
--
the
--
the
--
the
point
that
separates
the
--
the
sheep
from
the
goats
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
--
what
is
--
what
has
rate
setting
got
to
do
with
--
with
your
basic
point?
your
basic
point,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
some
of
the
money
that's
being
taken
from
the
--
from
the
local
union
and
in
our
example
subsidized
by
the
service
fee
is
being
used
to
subsidize
litigation
for
other
unions.
and
that
is,
it
seems
to
me,
exactly
true
in
the
insurance
case.
some
of
those
premiums
will
subsidize
litigation
--
speech
--
involving
speech
in
--
in
other
union
bargaining
areas.
what's
the
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
know
whether
that's
true
or
not.
if
you
buy
labor
litigation
insurance
i
suppose
it
is
not.
don't
they
set
their
rates
with
respect
to
the
experience
in
labor
litigation,
not
in
--
on
their
experience
with
automobile
accidents.
justice
david
h.
souter
neither
do
i.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
have
several
times
mentioned
the
public
forum
as
having
a
significance
in
drawing
the
line
and
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you
there.
why
did
you
say
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
this.
if
an
employer
and
a
union
local
decided
that
you
know
they
would
really
let
the
sunshine
in
and
they
would
conduct
their
collective
bargaining
in
a
theater
with
microphones
and
anybody
could
drop
in
and
hear,
would
that
change
the
chargibility
of,
as
against
the
dissenting
nonmembers.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
aren't
they,
aren't
they
equal
chargeable?
isn't
the
unspoken
premise
of
your
argument
and
what
lehnert
is
getting
at
--
they
are
not
only
germane,
but
isn't
there
an
unspoken
premise
that
just
as
the
union
will
support
--
the
union
of
the
dissident
objectors
in
negotiating
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
union
will
also
presumably
support
them
if
litigation
is
necessary
later
on
to
enforce
it?
so
that
the
so-called
standard
by
which
the
union's
obligation
to
support
the
litigation
and
the
unit
that
includes
the
dissidents
is
not
somehow
precisely
spelled
out.
the
assumption
is
that
they
do
have
some
obligation
to
support
the
litigation
if
it
comes
to
the
dissidents'
unit.
and
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
the
point
of
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
a
covenant,
in
effect,
of
support.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
there
is
no,
there
is
no
covenant
of
support.
there
is
what?
a
covenant
of
support
if
the
litigation
in
the
local
unit
that
includes
the
dissidents
has
wide
significance,
and
therefore
could
affect
other
units?
is
that
what
the
--
is
that
what
the
obligation
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
this
any
obligation
at
all?
you
said
okay,
there
is
an
obligation
of
some
kind
of
fair
dealing.
given
the
question
that
we've
got,
that
doesn't
matter
unless
the
fair
dealing
relates
at
some
point
to
support
for
litigation,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
how
do
we
articulate
what
that
obligation
is?
if
it's
not
covenant
to
support
regardless
of
what
the
litigation
is,
how
do
we
articulate
what
the
degree
of
the
obligation
of
support
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
trouble
with
saying
that
is
exactly
the
point
that
the
chief
justice
raised.
you
don't
take
the
position
that
no
matter
what
the
litigation
is,
the
parent
union
has
got
to
support
it.
therefore,
how
do
we
identify
the
litigation
that
they
will
support?
how
do
we
know
that
they
have
any
obligation
at
all?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
doesn't
create
a
guarantee
expressed
like
the
terms
of
an
insurance
policy,
but
there
is,
in
fact,
a
local
practice
to
which
one
can
refer.
and
it
seems,
it
would
seem
reasonable
in
a
case
like
that
to
say,
okay,
you
can
force
the
dissident
to
pay
a
fair
share
on
the
expectation
that
the
same
kind
of
enforcement
litigation
will
take
place
if
there
is
a
dispute
this
year
or
next
year.
we
don't
have,
as
i
understand
it,
a
clear
sort
of
expectation
standard
when
we
are
talking
about
affiliation
agreements
that
involve
a
parent
and
many,
many
other
locals.
and
the
point
here,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
determine
whether
there
is
any
obligation
at
all
whether
the
dissident
is
getting
anything
or
can
expect
to
get
anything
for
the
fee.
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
do
we
describe
that
obligation?
