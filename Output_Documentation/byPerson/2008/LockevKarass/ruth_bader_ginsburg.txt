mr.
young,
i
thought
that
in
ellis
the
litigation
--
the
ellis
court
said
that
that
litigation
did
not
have
as
its
subject
matter
negotiation
or
administration
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
quoting
from
--
i'm
quoting
from
that
decision
at
page
453.
the
case
involved
litigation
"not
involving
negotiation
or
administration
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
are
you
saying
the
court
got
it
wrong?
i
mean,
the
words
that
i'm
quoting
are
from
the
opinion:
"not
involving
negotiation
or
administration
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
only
thing
that
could
be
germane.
if
it
doesn't
relate
to
that,
then
your
case
is
solid.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
isn't
litigation
--
what
i
don't
understand
is
how
you
draw
a
line
between
the
--
the
negotiation
of
an
agreement,
where
lehnert
said
this
kind
of
pooling
is
okay,
and
the
enforcement
of
the
agreement.
i
mean,
we're
not
talking
about
litigation
unrelated
to
collective
bargaining.
it
is
only
litigation
that
deals
with
the
meaning
of
a
term
in
the
contract,
whether
what
the
employer
has
done
was
an
unfair
labor
practice,
whether
there
has
been
a
contractual
violation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
why
enforcing,
one
thing
is
making
the
agreement
and
there
you
agree
as
you
must
because
of
our
lehnert
decision
you
can't
have
these
pooling
arrangements.
what's
the
difference
between
negotiating
an
agreement
and
litigation
to
enforce
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
begins
begins
that's,
that's
my
point.
i
can't
see
the
difference
between
saying
pooling
is
okay
when
we're
dealing
with
negotiating
an
agreement,
but
it's
not
okay
when
we're
dealing
with
enforcing
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
did
the
court
mean
in
lehnert
when
it
said
there
must
be
some
indication
the
payment
is
for
service
that
may
ultimately
inure
to
the
benefit
of
members
of
the
local
union
by
virtue
of
their
membership
in
the
parent
organization?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
couldn't
it
be,
couldn't
the
national
say,
local,
you
have
asked
for
assistance
with
such-and-such
litigation.
we
think
your
case
is
what
this
court
sometimes
calls
a
bad
vehicle.
we
don't
want
to
finance
your
litigation,
the
issue
is
important
and
we
are
going
to
wait
for
a
case
that
presents
it
in
a
better
light,
is
more
likely
to
win.
