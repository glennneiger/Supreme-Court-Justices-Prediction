justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
that
each
time
they
buy
an
insurance
policy
they
have
to
investigate
which
locals
are
going
to
get
the
most
benefit
out
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
give
one
answer
to
the
chief
justice
on
the
facts
he
gave
and
a
different
one
if
the
record
showed
that
everybody
got
a
proportional
benefit
out
of
the
group
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
answer
doesn't
depend,
then,
on
the
facts
that
he
included
in
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
he
was,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
all
insurance
policies
are
bad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'd
be
interested
in
your
comments
on
this
dialogue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
--
you
exclude
the
librarian
example
of
justice
breyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
which
side?
you
have
to
be
clear
with
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
you
to
be
saying
they
could
not
charge
the
nonmember
for
the
expenses
of
the
hawaiian
librarian.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
librarian
in
hawaii
researching
something
that
the
plaintiff
has
no
interest
in
spending
money
on,
would
that
be
prohibited.
