mr.
w.
james
young
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
addresses
whether
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
permit
public
employers
to
compel
nonunion
employees
to
subsidize
the
union's
expressive
speech
of
a
political
nature
in
a
public
forum,
specifically
litigation
in
courts
and
before
administrative
agencies
not
involving
their
bargaining
unit.
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
this
question
is
no,
a
result
supported
by
the
court's
unanimous,
unambiguous,
and
categorical
holding
in
ellis.
in
ellis,
this
court
held
that,
to
avoid
constitutional
problems,
nonmembers
under
the
railway
labor
act
could
not
be
forced
to
subsidize
any
litigation
not
arising
within
their
bargaining
unit,
not
even
litigation
to
enforce
another
bargaining
unit's
agreement
in
bankruptcy
proceedings.
mr.
w.
james
young
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
justice
scalia,
but
my
answer
to
your
question--
mr.
w.
james
young
--well,
it
is
also
not
fair,
justice
scalia,
to
call
it
"insurance".
it's
affiliation,
and
the
answer
to
the
question--
mr.
w.
james
young
--well,
i
think
we
can
rely,
justice
scalia,
on
the
admissions
contained
in
msea's
brief,
which
clearly
concedes
that,
in
fact,
seiu
has
no
enforceable
obligations
under
its
affiliation
arrangement
with
msea.
mr.
w.
james
young
well,
of
course,
that
--
that
is
what
they
call
it,
justice
kennedy.
and
--
and
--
and
pooling
is
--
is
certainly
something
that
we
believe
the
court
rejected
in
ellis
when
it
set
forth
a
categorical
rule.
the
pooling
argument
was
raised
in
the
briefs
in
ellis,
and
this
court
did
not
see
fit
to--
mr.
w.
james
young
--i
don't
believe
that's
the
case,
justice
ginsburg,
because
ellis
dealt
with
enforcing
a
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
w.
james
young
well,
of
course,
justice
ginsburg,
the
--
some
of
the
litigation
did
involve
enforcing
another
bargaining
unit's
agreement
in
bankruptcy
proceedings.
i
don't
know
how
that
is
not
enforcing--
mr.
w.
james
young
--well,
that
--
that--
mr.
w.
james
young
--well,
i'm
trying
--
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
find
the
specific
language,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
apologize
for
my
inadequacy
in
this
regard.
but
i
think
the
point
that
we
--
i
think
the
point
that
we
would
rely
on
in
ellis
in
--
in
--
in
the
very
paragraph
that
you
referred
to
is
the
specificity
with
which
this
court
discussed
what
was
chargeable.
it
referred
to
the
contract,
for
instance.
it
referred
to
the
exclusive
representative
twice;
not
an
exclusive
representative,
but
the
exclusive
representative.
it
referred
to
the
bargaining
unit
not
less
than
five
times
in
that
single
paragraph
in
discussing
what
was
permissible
under
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
w.
james
young
well,
no,
justice
alito.
we
believe
--
we
believe
that
the
--
the
ellis
standard
is
the
constitutional
standard
as
both
principal
opinions
in
lehnert
discuss.
in
--
in
lehnert,
justice
blackmun
specifically
recognized
it
in
his
--
in
his
plurality
opinion;
and
justice
scalia
himself
said
there
was
good
reason
--
good
cause
to
treat
ellis
as
stating
the
constitutional
rule.
mr.
w.
james
young
real
insurance,
justice
souter?
i
think
that
--
obviously
that
would
be
a--
mr.
w.
james
young
--well
--
but
the
distinction,
justice
souter,
i
think
is
discussed
in
the
brief,
amicus
brief,
filed
by
pacific
legal
foundation.
for
one
thing,
it
would
not
be
the
labor
union
that
would
be
--
another
labor
union
receiving
those
insurance
funds.
it
would
be
a
third-party
insurer,
presumably.
that
would
be--
mr.
w.
james
young
--it
would
add
the
--
the
insult
of
the--
mr.
w.
james
young
--we
believe
it
would
not
be
if
the
international
affiliate
were
the
insurer,
justice
souter.
mr.
w.
james
young
that
--
that
is
the
--
that
is
our
argument,
justice
souter.
mr.
w.
james
young
i
--
i
don't
think
--
well,
i
don't
think
i
would
concede
the
premise
of
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
--
and
i
think
that
point
is
--
is
discussed
fairly
thoroughly
in
pacific
legal
foundation's
brief.
a
rate
setting
in
an
insurance
context
is
--
is
radically
different
than
the
affiliations
fee
setting
in
this
context.
rate
--
and
--
and
much
more
about
insurance
than,
frankly,
i
know;
but
it
--
it
certainly
is--
mr.
w.
james
young
--it's
also--
mr.
w.
james
young
--i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood.
mr.
w.
james
young
and
i'm
sorry,
chief
justice
roberts.
mr.
w.
james
young
and
--
and
i
--
and
i
appreciate
the
help,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
your
pointing
that
out,
justice
scalia.
my
--
i
--
i
misunderstood
the
question,
and
i
apologize.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
--
the
--
our
point
would
be,
however,
that
in
that
type
of
relationship
and
i
--
as
i
said,
that's--
mr.
w.
james
young
--well,
i
don't
think
that's
a
--
that's
a
decision
for
the
locals.
that's
the
insurer
setting
rates,
and
--
and
i
--
i
don't
know
of
a
market,
quite
honestly,
justice
stevens,
for
that
type
of
insurance.
mr.
w.
james
young
i
don't
--
no,
justice
stevens.
i
don't
think
my
question
--
my
answer
would
differ.
i
think,
however--
mr.
w.
james
young
--well,
one
looks
for
it
where
one
can
find
it,
justice
stevens
and
mr.
chief
justice.
the
differing
--
i
think
that
the
distinction
has
to
be
made
here
between
insurance
on
the
one
hand
and
affiliation.
there
--
in
--
in
the
insurance
context
you
have--
mr.
w.
james
young
--no,
no,
no.
i
--
i
--
i
concede
insurance,
justice
stevens.
i
--
my
point
--
if
it
is
true
insurance,
insurance
where
there
is
mutuality
of
obligation.
the
difficulty
that
this
court,
i
believe,
found
in
the
ellis
case
when
it
set
a
bright-line
test
was
that
it
was
public
--
and
i
--
and
i
think
can
be
discerned
from
the
court's
other
cases,
including
glickman
--
is
we're
talking
about
public
speech,
speech
of
a
political
nature
in
a
public
forum.
mr.
w.
james
young
and
i
--
and
i--
mr.
w.
james
young
--and
it
assuredly
is,
justice
souter.
mr.
w.
james
young
the
other
distinction
has
to
be
that
it
is
not
--
it
is
--
the
problem
also
arises
from
the
nature
of
the
forced
relationship.
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
cases
such
as
ellis
and
abood,
allowing
the
agency
shop
at
all
works
an
infringement
on
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
w.
james
young
well,
the
mutuality
of
obligation
coupled
with
true
rate
setting
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
--
there
is--
mr.
w.
james
young
--well,
the
distinction,
justice
souter,
would
be
that
there
is
--
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
larger
pool
created
than
just
a
union
litigation
pool
in
the
insurance
context.
furthermore,
the
--
the
--
the
money,
in
fact,
is
spread
about--
mr.
w.
james
young
--i
don't
know
of
an
insurance
company
that's
quite
that
specific,
justice
souter,
nor
have
i
ever
heard
of
labor
--
labor
union
insurance
--
labor
litigation
insurance.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
such
a
market
actually
exists.
mr.
w.
james
young
certainly
there
is
not
on
this
record
that
would
suggest
so,
sir.
mr.
w.
james
young
well,
of
course
if
the
other
union--
mr.
w.
james
young
--well,
obviously
first
amendment
harm,
justice
kennedy.
but
i
think
understanding
--
if
i
understand
your
hypothetical--
mr.
w.
james
young
--excuse
me,
justice
kennedy.
i'm
sorry
for
interrupting
you.
certainly
the
union
has
the
right
to
associate
as
it
sees
fit.
the
first
amendment
protects
that
right.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
it
doesn't
have
the
right
to
go
out
and
ask
other
labor
unions
to
contribute
to
its
litigation
activities.
what
the
first
amendment
--
the
--
the
first
amendment
right
to
not
speak
is
--
is
involved
when,
in
the
words
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
one
of
these
cases,
"they
seek
to
mulch
from
the
unwilling
moneys
for
their
speech
activities
in
a
public
forum.
"
mr.
w.
james
young
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
mr.
w.
james
young
thank
you,
sir.
and
my
point
would
be
under
the
hypothetical
as
i
understand
it,
you
posed
a
union
in
--
within
the
state
under
the
same
bargaining
agreement
being
asked
to
support
for
litigation
under
one
of
the
other
locals.
i
can
think
of
a
number
of
cases
where
that's
actually
the
case,
two
locals
under
one
bargaining
agreement
just
in
my
own
experience.
and
so
you're
not
suggesting
something
that's
unusual.
i
think
under
that
circumstances
that
would
fall
squarely
within
ellis'
rule.
it
involves
the
bargaining
agreement.
it
may
not
involve
the
specific
bargaining
unit,
but
it
is
concerning
the
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
w.
james
young
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
w.
james
young
because
that
goes
beyond
the
free
rider
rationale
which
justifies
the
agency
shop
in
the
earlier
cases
such
as
hansen
and
street.
the
free
rider
that
the
congress
was
concerned
with
--
and
of
course,
it's
been
adopted
through
abood
to
apply
to
the
states
--
the
free
rider
that
congress
was
concerned
with
is
the
free
rider
that
is
required
to
accept
the
union's
services
and
refuses
to
subsidize
those
services.
and
the
--
this
court
in
discussing
that
in
terms
of
lobbying
and
public
relations
activities
found
that
the
relationship
was
too
attenuated.
obviously
judicial
decisionmaking
and
administrative
decisionmaking
is
good
for
its
persuasive
effect
in
many
different
contexts.
but
that
--
that
relationship
was
found
to
be
too
attenuated
in
ellis
and
with
regard
to
litigation
and
certainly
in
lehnert
with
regard
to
public
relations--
mr.
w.
james
young
--under
lehnert,
justice
breyer,
the
expenditures
which
you
posit
would
be
chargeable
and
are
not
at
issue
here.
mr.
w.
james
young
because
benefit
has
never
been
the
touchstone.
and
under
ellis
and
under
lehnert
and
certain
pluralities--
mr.
w.
james
young
--because
we
are
talking
about
public
--
political
speech
of
a
public
nature.
mr.
w.
james
young
and
i
may--
mr.
w.
james
young
--i'd
be
happy
to
jump
in
here
somewhere,
justice
stevens.
i
appreciate
the
colloquy.
and
i
think
the
distinction
--
getting
back
to
the
point
justice
alito
raised,
and
the
sharp
distinction
that
has
been
made
in
the
compelled
speech
and
compelled
dues
cases
is
between
the
activities
--
certainly
in
the
compelled
union
dues
cases,
is
activities
for
which
nonmembers
are
compelled
to
accept
the
union
as
bargaining
representative.
mr.
w.
james
young
for
the
--
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
for
the
agreement,
for
the
unit,
we
concede
that
the
union
may
charge
for
that
public
speech
of
a
political
nature
in
a
public
forum.
we
have
no
dispute
over
charging
for
enforcing
or
--
or
--
enforcing
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
is
not
our
dispute.
the
dispute
here
is
only
over
expenditures
on
behalf
of
other
bargaining
units,
where
we
believe
ellis
said
it
was
too
attenuated,
but
because
it
is
not
--
my
point
would
be
that
the
litigation
which
is
acceptably
chargeable
--
i
think
the
presumptive
--
i
think
the
default
value
in
this
court's
decisionmaking
on
litigation
is
that
it's
nonchargeable.
however,
the
court
has
drawn
a
narrow
exception
for
that
public
speech
in
public
forum
which
is
related
to
the
union's
duties
as,
not
related
to
but
in
performance
of
the
union's
duties
as
bargaining
agent
the
duties
for
which
law
imposes
the
union
as
a
bargaining
agent.
mr.
w.
james
young
i
think
that
would
go
back
as
far
as
justice
marshall
and
marbury.
it
would
be
an
empty
right
if
the
union
were
able
to
negotiate
an
agreement
it
wouldn't
be
permitted
to
enforce.
mr.
w.
james
young
the
distinction
is,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
negotiation
of
the
agreement
does
not
occur
in
a
public
forum,
whereas
litigation
does,
and
that's
the
distinction
we
would
draw.
mr.
w.
james
young
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
sorry
if
i
was
confusing.
i
thought
i
was
very
specific.
it
is
chargeable
for
litigation
involving
the
bargaining
agreement.
we
don't
dispute
that.
mr.
w.
james
young
of
the
particular
unit.
that
is
not
in
dispute
here.
mr.
w.
james
young
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
not
concede
that.
we
believe
that
this
court
in
ellis
drew
a
bright
line,
and
i
think
that's
clear
in
ellis'
discussion
of
the
mutual
aid
pact
which
was
not
chargeable
in
ellis,
found
not
chargeable
in
ellis.
the
distinction
that
i
think
this
court
has
drawn
or
that
should
i
would
respectfully
suggest
should
be
drawn
is
that
--
is
a
narrow
one.
it's
consistent
with
strict
scrutiny
and
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
that
area.
only
for
speech
which
is
narrowly
related
to
the
union's
duties
as
bargaining
agent
and
performance
of
those
duties
can
public
speech
--
can
charging
nonmembers
for
public
political
speech
in
a
public
forum
be
justified.
mr.
w.
james
young
the
librarian
i
think
would
fall
under
the
general
lehnert
test.
mr.
w.
james
young
there
were
a
lot
of
sides
there,
justice
stevens.
mr.
w.
james
young
i
think
it
was
the
hawaiian
commemoration
that
justice
breyer
referred
to
that
i
think
i
had
to
rethink,
because
it
was
a
public
speech
in
a
public
forum.
the
librarian
researching
bargaining
issues
at
the
union
headquarters
in
downtown
washington
or
--
well,
in
downtown
washington
of
the
international
affiliate
i
think
is
chargeable
under
lehnert.
mr.
w.
james
young
well,
here,
justice
stevens,
we
are
simply
talking
about
of
course
the
international
affiliate.
as
far
as
cross-unit
affiliation,
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
that
would
fall
under
again,
general,
lehnert's
general
test.
mr.
w.
james
young
well,
of
course
they'd
be
allowed
to.
can
they
force
nonmembers--
mr.
w.
james
young
--the
public
celebration,
no;
the
librarian,
i
believe
so,
yes.
mr.
w.
james
young
well,
i
think
--
well,
justice
souter,
that
arises
from
the
court's
determinations
on
things
like
public
relations
and
lobbying
and
the
distinction
it
makes,
the
distinction
for
instance
in
lehnert
between
the
teacher's
voice
articles
and
the
reserve
public
education
program.
the
distinction
drawn
from
that,
the
different,
differing
results
is
that
where
internal
union
communications
regarding
nonpolitical
matters
were
treated
as
chargeable
by
a
majority
of
this
court
and
where
the,
outward
looking
speech
activities
is
treated
as
not
chargeable.
mr.
w.
james
young
no
justice
souter
because
the
speech
would
still
be
directed
at
the
public
employer
not
ex
--
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
w.
james
young
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
note
the
apocalyptic
predictions
that
are
suggested
from
the
rule
that
the
petitioners
are
advancing
are
avoidable
by
easily
--
readily
available
alternatives.
international
unions
would
of
course
be
free
to
make
loans
to
local
affiliates
engaged
in
massive
litigation
or
other
speech
activities
where
they
think
it's
appropriate.
but
the
alternative
is
not
between
prohibiting
pooling
arrangements
which
have
no
standards,
no
enforceability
and
no
predictability,
and
allowing
the
nonmembers
to
become
free
riders
on
legitimate
litigation
expenditures
funded
through
the
international
affiliate.
the
choice
is
between
a
malleable
--
a
malleable
unpredictable
and
ultimately
unenforceable
agreement
and
a
standard
which
would
allow
the
international
to
subsidize
such
litigation
and
allow
the
true
--
only
the
costs
of
that
litigation
to
be
extracted
from
nonmembers.
mr.
w.
james
young
we
don't
suggest
that
there
is
such
a
right,
justice
breyer.
mr.
w.
james
young
unfortunately
no,
justice
breyer.
mr.
w.
james
young
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
exactly
correct,
and
--
and
the
test
in
determining
whether
or
not
it
is
a
--
can
be
charged
across
bargaining
unit
lines
is
a
bright-line
test
of
whether
it
is
a
speech
activity.
mr.
w.
james
young
i'm
afraid
you've
got
two
principled
advocates
before
you
mr.
chief
justice
who
are
holding
firm
to
their
positions.
i
would
however
like
to
address
one
more
point.
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
recall,
get
us
back
again
to
the
focus
on
this
is
compelled
speech
subject
to
the
court's
strict
scrutiny
jurisprudence.
the
test
suggested
by
msea
is
that
a
union's
activities
are
subject
to
a,
subject
to
the
duty
of
fair
representation
and
to
the
covenant
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing
under
the
duty
of
fair
and/or
under
the
duty
of
fair
represent
which
of
course
is
that
wide
range
of
reasonableness
cannot
be
sustained
where
this
court's
standard
is
the
least
restrictive
means.
thank
you.
