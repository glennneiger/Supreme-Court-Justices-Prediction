but,
of
course,
they
wouldn't
be
subsidizing
it
if
--
if,
indeed,
it
is
some
kind
of
a
--
essentially
an
insurance
scheme.
they
--
they
contribute
to
the
national
union,
and
in
exchange
the
national
union
defends
their
interest
just
as
it
defends
the
interest
of
other
unions.
you
didn't
address
that
--
that
pooling
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
fair
to
call
it
"subsidizing"
if,
in
fact,
that's
what's
going
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
because
that
wasn't
inquired
into
by
the
court
below.
i
guess
we
really
--
we
really
don't
know,
do
we,
when
--
whether
the
local
union
can
make
any
demands
upon
the
--
upon
the
national
union
for
--
for
litigation
defense?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it's
based
on
the
experience
of
the
whole
--
the
whole
cohort
of
insureds.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
chief
justice's
question
says:
can
a
--
can
a
--
a
local
that
is
certainly
on
the
basis
of
past
experience
not
going
to
need
this
insurance
nearly
as
much
as
other
locals
--
can
it
enter
into
an
insurance
arrangement
with
other
locals
to
buy
the
insurance
for
all
of
the
locals
even
though
it
knows
that
it
won't
benefit
very
much
from
that
insurance
policy?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
--
he
was
trying
to
help
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
should
have
said,
yes,
chief
justice.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
isn't
banned.
it's
just
--
just
--
you
know,
you
don't
force
the
nonunion
member
who
indeed
may
be
anti-union
to
pay
for
it.
and
he
doesn't
want
to
subsidize
the
union
librarian.
he
doesn't
like
unions
here.
he
doesn't
like
unions
in
hawaii.
and
for
the
government
to
force
him
to
--
to
support
the
union
is,
i
thought,
part
of
the
reasoning
behind--
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
is
not
whether
that's
a
fair
thing
for
the
national
union
to
do.
the
issue
is
whether
the
person
who
is
being
compelled
against
his
will
to
pay
dues
to
the
union
is
getting
anything
back
for
that
compelled
payment.
and
even
though
the
national
union
may
be
acting
in
an
entirely
fair
fashion,
given
its
national
objectives,
the
--
the
compelled
payment
is
not
doing
what
our
cases
seem
to
say
it
must
do.
it
has
to
be
paying
for
services
rendered.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
doesn't
have
to
do
that.
it
can
use
the
money
of
its
union
members
any
way
it
wants.
it
can
contribute
to
the
national
all
of
their
money
if
it
wishes.
we
are
only
talking
about
that
portion
of
the
union
income
which
comes
from
people
who
don't
want
to
join
the
union.
