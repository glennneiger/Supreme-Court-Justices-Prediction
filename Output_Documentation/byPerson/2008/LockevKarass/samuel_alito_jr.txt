do
you
want
to
stand
or
fall
on
the
all-or-nothing
argument
that
nonmembers
can
never
be
required
to
pay
for
any
extra-unit
litigation
expenses,
or
do
you
have
an
--
an
additional
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
does
it
have
to
be
political
speech?
isn't
it
enough
that
it
is
simply
speech
that
certain
people
don't
want
to
subsidize,
or
speech,
so
that
the
commemoration
in
hawaii
may
be
something
that
99.999
percent
of
the
population
would
find
very
commendable,
but
someone
is
being
forced
to
pay
for
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose,
let's
say,
that
one
or
more
locals
someplace
else
in
the
country
are
involved
in
very,
very
expensive
litigation;
and,
as
a
result,
the
international
assesses
all
of
the
locals
a
fee
to
pay
--
to
pay
for
that
litigation
but
at
the
same
time
adopts
a
position
that
it
is
extremely
unlikely
in
the
future
that
the
international
will
ever
subsidize
any
other
local
union
litigation
expenses.
would
the
local
--
would
a
--
would
a
local
union
not
involved
in
that
litigation
--
would
they
--
would
it
be
permissible
for
them
to
charge
their
nonmembers?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
you
concede
that,
then
aren't
you
conceding
there
has
to
be
some
standard
by
--
under
which
to
assess
whether
the
local
union
that
is
being
required
to
pay
the
fee
for
extra-unit
litigation
expenses
is
getting
something
back
in
return?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
not
necessary
for
there
to
be
any
standard
under
which
to
assess
that
they
are
getting
anything
back
in
return?
if
it's
clear
they
are
not
getting
anything
back
in
return,
it's
still
okay?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
certain
--
if
certain
fees
are
are
being
assessed
on
the
theory
that
this
is
a
pooling
arrangement,
i
don't
understand
why
you're
resisting
any
effort
to
impose
any
standards
or
any
inquiry
as
to
whether
it's
really
a
pooling
arrangement?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
argument
seems
to
be
that
the
whole
analogy
of
a
pooling
arrangement
is
invalid.
that
was
unrealistic,
because
there
really
is
no
way
of
telling
whether
any
of
these
things
is
a
pooling
arrangement.
there
is
no
standard
that
could
possibly
be
articulated
that
would
be
meaningful
to
determine
whether
something
that
is
labelled
a
pooling
arrangement
really
is
in
any
way
a
pooling
arrangement.
that
seems
to
me
argument.
that
would
seem
to
cut
against
the
whole
idea
of
pooling
arrangements
not
only
for
litigation
expenses,
but
for
everything
else.
