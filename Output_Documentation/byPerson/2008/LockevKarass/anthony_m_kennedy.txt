well,
if
we
don't
call
it
"insurance",
can
we
all
it
"pooling"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
did
want
to
understand
your
position.
suppose
there
is
a
statewide
contract
for
public
employees
and
one
union
brings
a
suit
to
interpret
a
provision
of
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
having
to
do
with
overtime
or
holidays
or
something.
and
then
it
notifies
the
other
union,
we're
going
to
have
to
drop
this
litigation
because
we
can't
afford
it.
even
though
it
ultimately
may
affect
you
down
the
line,
you're
not
a
party.
i
don't
see
the
harm
in
allowing
the
other
union
to
subsidize
or
contribute
--
use
whatever
verb
you
want
--
that
litigation
--
that
litigation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
--
what
harm
are
we
trying
to
prevent
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
amendment
can
be
--
can
be
a
sword
or
a
shield.
this
union
wants
to
use
it
as
a
sword
in
order
to
promote,
in
order
to
protect
its
rights
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
i
don't
see
the
harm.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
quite
the
hypothetical.
let's
say
there
are
two
bargaining
agreements
but
they're
identical,
and
that
this
litigation
that's
underway
will
have
persuasive
force
for
the
union
that's
thinking
about
entering,
and
then
the
union
decides
that
it
is
going
to
enter
to
help
the
union
involved
in
the
suit,
and
the
members
of
the,
of
the
contributing
union
object
and
you
say
they
have
a
first
amendment
right.
that's
your
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see
why
the
objects
of
collective
bargaining
the,
objects
of
union
--
of
the
union,
are
not
being
fulfilled.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
us
two
hypotheticals.
one
is
the
librarian,
two
is
the
public
celebration.
would
nonunion,
would
participating
unions
be
allowed
to
contribute
to
either
of
those
activities?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
against
nonmembers?
against
members,
there
has
to
be
a
pro-ration,
they
has
to
be
a
pro-ration.
a
with
the
librarian,
b
with
the
celebration.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
one
of
the
difficulties
it
seems
to
me
is
the
petitioner's
position
with
the
sort
of
all
or
nothing
approach.
but
you
seemed
to
be
taking
the
mirror
position
of
that.
your
argument
is
all
or
nothing
on
your
side.
i
don't
get
much
help
from
either
side
as
to
what
the
standard
should
be.
i
know
germane
is
obviously
a
malleable
word,
but
we
are
looking
to
see
if
there
is
some
test
that
we
can
use
that's
not
all
or
nothing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
haven't
heard
from
either
side
yet
what
that
would
be.
