justice
stephen
g.

what
i
don't
understand
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--finish
because
there's
something--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
the
part
i
don't
understand.
it's
not
your
fault.
i
don't
understand
it
in
the
cases
either.
what
first
amendment
right
are
we
talking
about?
there
is
an
individual
who,
under
the
agency
shop,
pays
dues
to
a
union.
now,
suppose
the
union
uses
some
of
that
money
in
a
way
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
politics,
nothing
to
do
with
speech,
but
it
doesn't
happen
to
benefit
that
particular
member.
for
example,
you
can
have
a
central
union
headquarters
4,000
miles
away
where
there's
a
librarian
who's
doing
research
on
a
matter
that
will
help
lots
of
people,
but
nobody
in
this
area.
or
you
could
have
a
program
to
commemorate
the
people
who
were
hurt
in
the
state
of
hawaii
at
a
union
uprising
or
strike
of
some
kind
where
nobody
in
this
particular
area
is
ever
going
to
go.
now,
both
of
those
activities
are
totally
legitimate
union
activities
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
politics.
but
this
particular
place
won't
benefit
from
them.
okay,
what
in
the
first
amendment
prohibits
the
union
from
paying
for
such
an
activity
out
of
general
union
dues
assessed
on
everybody?
and
why
would
the
first
amendment
prohibit
such
a
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
if
they
are
chargeable
because
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
politics,
perfectly
legitimate,
why
isn't
it
also
chargeable
to
pay
for
the
costs
of
a
lawsuit
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
politics,
totally
for
a
union
purpose,
it
just
doesn't
happen
to
benefit
that
person
who's
miles
away
in
a
different
local?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
you
to
tell
me
about
cases.
i'm
abstracting
from
--
i
want
to
know
the
reasoning.
i
want
to
know
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
said
there
is
no
politics
in
any
of
these
expenditures.
42
bishops
would
swear
there
is
nothing
here
that
has
anything
to
do
with
politics.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
the
reasoning
that
you
seem
to
accept
and
i
guess
all
human
activity
is
banned.
because
to
my
knowledge,
all
human
activity
takes
place
through
speech
with
a
few
exceptions
that
are
not
here
relevant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
rule
or
a
reg
somewhere
in
the
labor
department
that
says
if
the
national
union
takes
its
money
from
its
local,
spends
it
in
a
way
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
politics
whatsoever,
zero
--
but
either
wastes
it
or
they
build
too
big
a
building,
or
they
do
something
that
doesn't
benefit
local
number
432,
does
432
have
any
remedy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no
remedy
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
union
members
who
are
being
gypped,
they
just
have
to
put
up
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
are
you
saying
you
could
bring
a
lawsuit
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
either
--
in
these
cases
everybody
in
the
union
whether
they're
forced
or
not,
has
this
kind
of
remedy
or
nobody
does?
that's
your--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
case
--
the
case
that
says
that
a
union
member,
person
forced
into
the
union
agency
shop
--
and
i
guess
a
lawyer
who
has
to
pay
to
be
an
integrated
bar
and
i
guess
a
doctor
who
has
to
join
a
medical
association
--
the
case
that
says
that
these
people
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
get
back
money
that's
being
wasted,
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
unless
it's
political
in
your
view,
you
don't
have
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
maine
state
law,
like
a
lot
of
state
laws,
if
a
government
employee
disagrees
with
and
does
not
belong
to
the
local
union
that
represents
that
employee
and
all
the
others
in
the
workplace,
then
the
one
who
disagrees
still
has
to
pay
the
union
something,
a
service
fee
instead
of
the
union
dues.
now
this
court
has
long
held
in
principle
that
although
there
are
certain
exceptions,
government
may
require
this
kind
of
a
payment
without
violating
the
first
amendment.
it's
not
quite
voluntary
but
still
they
can
pay.
the
union
can
charge
them.
now
in
this
case,
which
is
a
kind
of
question
i
find
that
draw
that
line
between
what
they
can
and
cannot
charge.
a
local
union
charges
the
nonmembers
a
service
fee
that
among
other
things
reflects
an
affiliation
fee
that
the
local
pays
the
national.
now
that
affiliation
fee
that
all
the
locals
pay
the
national
in
turn
has
a
component
that
the
national
uses
in
order
to
pay
its
lawyers.
so
the
question
is
whether,
the
local,
when
it
charges
the
nonmembers
their
pro
rata
share
of
the
dues,
whether
it
can
include
a
pro
rata
share
of
that
part
of
the
fee
it's
going
to
pay
the
national
that
goes
to
paying
the
national's
lawyers'
litigation
expenses.
that's
the
question.
and
the
answer
to
the
question
in
our
view
is
yes,
it
can.
and
there
are
two
conditions.
first,
it
has
to
be
that
litigation
that
the
national
is
involved
in
has
to
be
the
subject
matter,
has
to
be
the
kind
that
would
be
chargeable
if
local
litigation
by
unions
were
at
issue.
and
second,
the
litigation
involved,
that
kind
of
obligation
that
charged
for
the
national,
it
has
to
be
reciprocal
in
nature.
so
the
local
that
gives
the
money
to
the
national
has
to
expect
that
other
locals
will
contribute
to
its
problems
that
need
to
be
resolved
by
litigation
just
as
it
is
now
contributing
to
the
others.
but
where
those
two
things
are
concerned,
subject
matter
is
right
and
there
is
reciprocity,
then
the
union
can
charge
the
nonmembers
that
money
and
our
opinion
explains
why
all
that
is
so.
and
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
which
reached
a
similar
conclusion.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
alito
has
filed
the
concurring
opinion
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
have
joined.
