of
course,
for
a
terry
--
for
a
terry
pat
down
you
don't
need,
do
you,
articulable
suspicion
that
the
person
is
armed
and
dangerous?
so
long
as
you
have
a
suspicion
of
unlawful
activity,
you
can
stop
the
individual
and
pat
down.
do
you
have
to
have,
in
addition
to
stopping
the
individual,
an
articulable
suspicion
that
he's
armed
and
dangerous?
justice
antonin
scalia
both
armed
and
dangerous?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
i
--
i
thought
you
said
that
there
has
to
be
an
articulable
suspicion
that
he
is
armed
and
dangerous.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
bulge
would
not
be
enough
to
conduct
a
pat
down
after
a
terry
stop,
therefore.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
why
should
it
be
enough
to
--
to
justify
a
pat
down
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand.
i
weigh
all
the
factors,
and
there's
nothing
but
a
bulge.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
the
bulge
alone
--
well,
whether
i
believe?
there
has
to
be,
you
know,
a
reasonable
basis
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--an
articulable
basis
for
the
belief,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
don't
see
why
a
bulge
alone
would
--
would
satisfy--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
have
a
whole
separate
line
of
cases
apart
from
the
terry
stop
cases
which
allow
officers
to
protect
themselves
by
conducting
a
search
of
the
surrounding
area
when
they
arrest
somebody.
and
that
justifies
a
pat
down
of
the
person
that
they
arrest
also,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
or
not
they
think
that
--
that
he's
about
to
--
to
draw
the
gun
and
shoot
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
that
line
of
cases
be
extendable
to
this
kind
of
a
situation?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
during
a
traffic
stop
shouldn't
they
be
able
to
ensure
their
own
safety
by
--
by
patting
down
the
people
who
have
been
stopped,
whether
or
not
they
have
an
articulable
suspicion
that
they
are
about
to
draw
and
shoot?
but
that's
not
what
you're
proposing,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
go
the
terry
route
instead
of
the
route
that
--
that
covers
search
of
the
area
around
the
person
who
is
arrested?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
had
this
descended
from
a
--
a
seizure
to
a
post-seizure
consensual
encounter?
why
was
the
seizure
over?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
you're
--
you're
acknowledging
that
she
said
that
it
was
a
purely
--
you're
not
arguing
it
as
based
on
a
purely
consensual
encounter?
i
thought
that
that's
what
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
though
she
said
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
--
mr.
pincus,
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
previous
subject
for
a
minute.
we
certainly
didn't
take
this
case
to
decide
whether
the
passenger
was
free
to
leave
or
not.
that
--
that
was
not
the
issue
on
which
we
took
the
case.
and
you
claim
that
that
issue
has
already
been
resolved
by
findings
of
the
lower
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
in
order
to
contradict
that,
would
we
have
to
find
that
that's
clearly
erroneous?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
what
about
--
i
--
i
guess
if
we
held
that
you
could
do
this,
this
pat-down
search
here,
it
would
probably
carry
forward
to
any
other
kind
of
seizure
like
a
--
a
roadblock
to
inspect
for
drunken
driving
or
anything
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
would
say
the
same
thing:
that
if
there
is
a
passenger
in
that
car,
you
could
tell
the
passenger
to
get
out
and
conduct
a
pat-down
search.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
so
fast.
[laughter]
what
--
what
--
the
"armed
and
dangerous"
requirement,
does
the
"dangerous"
requirement
mean
endangering
the
policeman,
or
is
it
not
--
is
it
enough
if
--
if
you
think
this
--
this
fellow
is
--
you
know,
he's
just
a
dangerous
character.
is
that
enough,
or
does
it
have
to
be
an
immediate
threat
to
the
policeman?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
--
it's
not
enough
if
you
think
he's
--
he's
al
capone?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
say
about
the
other
--
the
other
side's
point
that
in
the
case
of
a
terry
stop,
there's
a
--
a
mutually
reinforcing
aspect?
you
have
a
suspicion
that
--
that
there
is
crime
afoot
to
begin
with,
plus
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
suspicion
that
the
person
is
armed
and
dangerous;
whereas,
here,
you
know,
it's
a
traffic
stop,
is
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
--
what
is
required
where
you
think
criminal
activity
is
afoot
is
not
necessarily
going
to
be
the
same
as
what's
required
when
you
--
when
there's
just
a
traffic
stop.
