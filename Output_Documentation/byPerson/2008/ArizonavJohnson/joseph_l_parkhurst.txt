mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
asks
that
this
court
apply
the
principles
established
in
pennsylvania
v.
mimms
to
uphold
the
pat-down
search
of
a
vehicle
passenger
seized
during
a
lawful
traffic
stop.
mimms
established
that
a
traffic
stop
satisfies
terry's
first
prong
as
to
suspicion
of
criminal
activity,
and
it
also
established
that
a
pat
down
of
a
driver
is
justified
if
the
officer
has
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
driver
is
armed
and
dangerous.
fourth
amendment
searches
must
be
reasonable,
and
the
pat
down
in
this
case
was
reasonable.
and
it
is
common
--
it's
a
commonsense
principle
that
the
principles
in
mimms
also
apply
to
passengers
in
the
context
of
a
traffic
stop.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
no,
no.
that's
not
what
i'm
saying,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
what
i
said
is
that
mimms
establishes
that
a
pat
down
is
justified
in
the
context
of
a
traffic
stop
if
the
officer
believes
that
the
driver
is
armed
and
dangerous.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
that
--
yes,
chief
justice.
that
can
happen
in
a
--
in
a
traffic
stop.
there's
no
evidence
in
this
particular
case
that
there
was
any
kind
of
evolution
to
a
consensual
encounter.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
no,
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
an
officer
can
conduct
a
pat
down
any
time
it
is
reasonable
in
light
of
factors
that
the
officer
may
notice
about
the
individual.
if
the
--
if
the
individual
presents
an
immediate
danger
to
the
officer
or
to
the
public,
a
pat
down
may
be
reasonable
under
the
broad
fourth
amendment
principles,
even
if
this
happens
to
be
a
consensual
encounter
or
a--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--if
--
if
the
officer
possesses
articulable
facts
that
this
person
is
immediately
dangerous
to
that
officer.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
well,
the
first
prong
of
the
terry
analysis,
justice
ginsburg,
is
whether
the
officer's
action
is
justified
at
its
inception,
and
one
way
that
it
may
be
justified
is
if
the
officer
possesses
suspicion
that
criminal
activity
is
afoot.
but
we
also
know
from
other
case
law
that
another
way
the
officer's
actions
may
be
justified
is
during
a
traffic
stop
where
there's
no
criminal
activity
at
all.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
i
believe
that's
what
terry
says,
that
you--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
well,
he
would
also
have
to
possess
articulable
reasons
that
a
prudently
--
a
reasonably
prudent
person
would
be
satisfied
with
that
this
person
is
an
immediate
danger
to
him.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
well,
that
--
that
could
very
well
support
a
pat
down.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
what
--
what
i'm
suggesting,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
first
prong
of
terry
is
much
broader
than
just
suspicion
of
criminal
activity.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
well,
what
i'm
suggesting,
justice
souter,
is
that
in
the
officer's
community
caretaking
function,
the
officer
is
authorized
to
approach
an
individual
that
he
--
he
thinks
is
trouble,
and
in
the
course
of
asking
neutral
questions,
if
the
officer
believes
that
this
person
is
immediately
dangerous
to
the
officer,
then
a
pat
down
would
be
appropriate
in
that
instance.
i'm
not--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--in
almost--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--well,
that's--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--what
--
what
i'm
saying,
justice
alito,
is
that
in
this
particular
case
we
certainly
have
a
legitimate
stop,
and
under
brendlin
we
--
we
also
know
that
the
passenger
is
seized
during
a
reasonably
routine
traffic
stop
until
the
passenger
is
released.
so
what
we
have
here
is
a
presumption
that
the
officer
has
the
authority
to
control
the
passenger
during
the
routine
traffic
stop,
and
we
also
have
an
--
an
instance
in
a
traffic
stop
where
an
officer
cannot
avoid
the
individual,
be
it
a
driver
or
passenger.
so
in
our
case,
it
seems
like
the
easy
case
where
mr.
johnson
and
officer
trevizo
were
placed
in
close
proximity,
she
detected
things
about
him
that
she
believed
made
him
a
threat
to
her,
an
immediate
threat,
and
therefore
all
we're
asking
in
our
case
is
that
she
be
--
she
have
the
entitlement
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
pat
him
down.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
well--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--she
said
that
he
could
have
refused
to
get
out
of
the
car.
there's
two
things
about
that,
justice
ginsburg.
one
is
we
don't
need
to
credit
necessarily
the
officer's
own
subjective
beliefs
as
to
the
--
whether
the
subject
was
free
to
leave
or
not.
the
second
thing
is,
we
know
from
brendlin
that
unless
the
officer
has
given
or
the
individual
has
asked
for
permission
to
leave,
there's
--
there
is
really
no
release.
so
officer
trevizo
was
certainly
entitled
to
enter
a
consensual
conversation
with
mr.
johnson
during
the
lawful
seizure,
but
there
was
no
indication
that
he
was
free
to
leave.
moreover,
even
if
he
reasonably
felt
free
to
leave,
it's
irrelevant
to
whether
he
reasonably
posed
a
danger
to
the
officer.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
correct.
and
whether
or
not--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--right.
certainly--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--correct.
it
would
be
analogous
to,
say,
a
--
an
inmate
in
a
prison
offering
to
give
information
to
one
of
the
prison
guards.
there's
no
question
that
the
inmate
is
still
in
custody,
even
though
the
conversation
itself
is
consensual.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
it
would
be
--
in
the
context
of
a
traffic
stop,
because
of
all
the
unknowns
that
an
officer
must
face,
a
bulge
is
usually
sufficient
to
justify
a
pat
down.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
in
that
instance,
it
may
be
the
prudent
course
to
at
least
ask
whether
the
person
is
armed.
on
a
--
on
a
random--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--well,
then
the
officer
could
ask
something
along
the
lines
of
whether
he
has
a
permit
to
carry
a
gun.
and
whether
or
not
the
person
has
a
permit
to
carry
the
gun
or
is
lawfully
in
possession
of
the
gun,
it's
a
matter
of
basically
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
whether--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--right--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--that
--
that's
exactly
--
exactly
what
i'm--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--well,
because
--
well,
there
was
no
bulge
in
this
case.
however,
it's
a
matter
of
all
the
factors.
it's
a
weighing
of
all
the
factors
together.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
okay.
well,
it's
a
matter
of
whether
you
believe
that
the
person
is
dangerous.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
right.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
well,
in
mimms
it
was
just
a
bulge
in
the
--
the
driver's
jacket
that
justified
the
pat
down.
however,
a
person
may
possess
a
gun
lawfully,
and
that
person
may
or
may
not
be
a
danger.
for
instance,
an
off-duty
police
officer,
they
often
carry
their
sidearms
with
them.
they
are
not
going
to
--
even
if
another
officer
knows
that
they're
armed,
they
don't
perceive
them
as
a
danger,
and
therefore
no
pat
down
is
going
to
ensue.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
correct.
it's
--
it's
a
matter--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--well,
it's
a
matter
of,
during
a
traffic
stop
--
brendlin
even
says
that
officers
must
be
able
to
exercise
unquestioned
command
of
the
situation.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
well,
what
i'm
proposing
is
the
--
the
standard
terry
test,
that--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--the
suspicion
must
be
that
they're
armed
and
dangerous.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
well,
i
believe
that
this
--
the
facts
of
this
case
fall
pretty
much
under
terry.
a
--
a
traffic
stop
will
--
will
impose
circumstances
that
you're
not
going
to
get
in
a
--
in
a
normal
street
encounter,
because
basically
an
officer
--
we
presume
that
an
officer
has
the
authority
to
control
any
of
the
occupants
of
a
car.
and
"control"
means
not
just
ordering
them
out,
as
in
mimms
and
wilson,
but
also
making
sure
that
one
of
the
occupants
doesn't
get
behind
you
while
you're
dealing
with
the
traffic
investigation.
it's
--
it's--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--that's
the
normal
situation,
and
usually
that's
the
analysis
that
bears
on
whether
the
driver
has
given
valid
consent
to
a
search
of
the
automobile
or
something
like
that.
we
--
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
a
pat-down
search
is
not
an
evidence
search.
this
is
not
a
full
search.
it's
just
a
search
of
the
outer
clothing
for
an
immediately
accessible
weapon.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
well,
because
once
he
was
arrested
for
the
gun,
then
they
did
a
search
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
she
did
not--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--no,
she
--
she
did.
she
believed
that
he
posed
an
immediate
danger
to
her
based
on
the
numerous
factors
that
she
cited
in
her
testimony.
so
she
was
--
she
was
afraid.
she
was
afraid
from
the
outset,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
because
of
the
way
that
he
made
eye
contact
with
the
officers.
however,
we
don't
want
our
officers
to
avoid
their
law
enforcement
functions
just
because
they're
in
contact
with
a
possibly
dangerous
person.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
well,
we're
arguing
that
the
seizure
was
not
over.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
no.
no,
your
honor.
we're
suggesting
that
the
seizure
had
never
ended
in
this
case.
the
arizona
court
of
appeals--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--correct,
because
we
don't
have
to
necessarily
take
her
word
for
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
that's
a
--
that's
a
legal--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--i
--
well--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--we
believe
that
that
is
true.
that's
not
the
rule
that
necessarily
arises
from
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
we
believe
that
there
is
a
seizure
throughout
the
entire
encounter,
and
that
there's
really
--
there's
no
question
that,
as
a
seized
passenger,
officer
trevizo
could
pat
him
down.
and
unless
the
court
has
any
other
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
this
--
this
case
falls
directly
under
mimms
and
wilson.
mimms
and
wilson
both
hold
that
the
officer
has
the
authority
to
control
the
occupants
of
an
automobile
with
or
without
suspicion
of
any
wrongdoing
by
the
occupant.
in
this
case,
also,
the
traffic
stop
satisfies
the
first
prong
of
terry,
as
we
know
from
mimms.
also,
there's
no
reason
to
suggest
that
this
was
any
more
than
the
normal
length
of
a
traffic
stop
here.
in
fact,
the
evidence
was
that
the
--
one
officer
was
still
talking
with
the
driver
while
officer
trevizo
was
conversing
with
mr.
johnson.
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
well--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--the
--
yes,
that's
true.
however,
we--
mr.
joseph
l.
parkhurst
--she
--
officer
trevizo
testified
repeatedly
at
the
hearing
that
she
did
not
believe
he
was
actually
about
to
commit
a
crime.
she
could
not
put
her
--
put
her
finger
on
exactly
what
it
was
that
he
was
doing
at
the
moment.
however,
we
believe
that,
in
the
context
of
a
traffic
stop,
we
--
the
state
has
satisfied
the
first
terry
prong
here
because
traffic
stops
frequently
don't
involve
any
kind
of
criminal
activity,
just
as
--
as
in
this
case,
a
civil
violation.
however,
that
was
enough
to
put
the
officer
and
the
individual
in
close
proximity,
and
if
she
noticed
enough
indicia
of
--
that
he
was
dangerous,
she
certainly
was
authorized
to
conduct
a
pat-down
search.
