justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you're
doing
away
with
the
first
terry
factor
altogether.
you're
saying
all
you
need
is
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
person
is
armed
and
dangerous.
what
happened
to
the
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
crime
has
just
been
committed
or
is
in
the
course
of
being
committed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
are
doing
away
with
the
first
terry
factor.
there
are
two
factors,
you
recognize:
one,
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion
that
a
crime
is
afoot;
and,
two,
this
person
is
reasonably
suspected
of
being
armed
and
dangerous.
your
answer
to
justice
souter
suggests
that
you
don't
need
the
first
one.
you
don't
need
to
have
any
suspicion
that
a
crime
is
afoot;
it's
enough
for
you
to
reasonably
suspect
that
the
person
is
armed
and
dangerous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
officer
trevizo
herself
testified
that
she
thought
the
seizure
part
was
over.
she
asked
him
would
he
get
out
of
the
car,
and
then
she
said
--
i
think
she
used
the
word
"consensual"
herself,
that
it
was
a
consensual
encounter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
after
the
initial
seizure
was
over,
and
then
she
wanted
to
question
him
about
gang
--
his
gang
affiliations
--
and
didn't
she
testify?
i
seem
to
remember
she
did,
and
she
said
it
--
it
was
voluntary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
--
when
did
this
end?
you
said
--
you
said
when
the
car
is
stopped
everyone
is
seized,
the
driver
and
the
passengers
as
well.
the
seizure
ends
at
some
point.
is
that
when
the
driver
is
ticketed
and
the
police
cruise
off
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
how
did
the
--
how
did
the
officer
come
up
with
the
marijuana
as
well
as
the
gun?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say
--
your
brief
goes
much,
much
further.
and
i'm
looking
at
page
9
where
you
say,
police
have
to
be
able
to
protect
"the
officer's
safety
from
a
person
reasonably
believed
to
be
armed
and
dangerous
whenever
the
officer
encounters
that
person
in
a
place
where
the
officer
has
a
lawful
right
to
be.
"
i
read
that
to
mean
if
the
law
officer
is
on
the
street,
in
a
pub,
any
place
where
he
has
a
lawful
right
to
be,
that
officer
can,
on
the
basis
of
a
suspicion
of
armed
and
dangerous,
pat
down.
and
you
don't
need
the
first
terry.
it's
only
--
it's
only
the
armed
and
dangerous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
what
mr.
--
mr.
parkhurst
said
in
his
opening
that
the
traffic
stop
is
the
equivalent
of
the
articulable
suspicion
that
a
crime
was
afoot.
it
justifies
this
stop,
and
then
you
have
to
have
something
further
to
justify
the
pat
down,
but
this
--
the
car,
the
seizure
of
the
car
and
its
passengers,
that
is
the
equivalent
of
the
first
terry.
and
why
isn't
that
so?
it's
a
stop.
it's
a
legitimate
stop.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
don't
you
lose
under
that
line
of
cases,
bostick
and
--
this
is
the
picture
that
the
officer
was
painting,
or
i
thought
it
was,
to
bring
this
within
the
"mind
if
i
search
your
luggage.
"
category
of
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
he
says
yes.
so
she's
got
to
have
consent.
she
doesn't
have
to
--
she
said,
he
said
okay,
he
would
get
out
and
talk
to
me;
he
said
okay
when
i
began
to
pat
him
down;
it's
only
in
the
middle
of
it
he
began
to
wriggle
a
little
bit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
he
not
be
dangerous?
i
mean,
first,
she
said:
i
suspected
him
because
he
was
looking
behind.
but
then
she
said
he
was
wearing
the
clothes
of
a
gang.
and
then
he
admits
to
having
been
convicted
of
a
burglary.
why
isn't
it
very
normal
for
a
person
to
be
apprehensive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
authority
of
police
officers
to
stop
and
frisk
a
passenger
in
a
motor
vehicle
temporarily
seized
upon
police
detection
of
a
traffic
infraction.
in
a
pathmarking
1968
decision,
terry
v.
ohio,
this
court
considered
whether
in
the
absence
of
a
warrant
to
a
course
therefore,
the
police
may
temporarily
stop
an
individual
for
questioning
and
frisk
him
or
her
for
weapons.
terry
upheld
stop
and
frisk
as
a
constitutionally
permissible
police
practice,
one
that
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment's
ban
on
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
if
two
conditions
are
met.
first,
the
investigatory
stop
must
be
lawful,
that
requirement
is
met
in
an
on-the-street
encounter
when
the
police
officer
reasonably
suspects
that
the
person
apprehended
is
committing
or
has
committed
a
criminal
offense.
second,
to
proceed
from
a
stop
to
a
frisk,
the
officer
must
reasonably
suspect
that
the
person
stopped
is
armed
and
dangerous.
respondent
johnson
was
a
passenger
in
an
automobile
stopped
by
arizona
police
officers
for
a
traffic
violation
warranting
a
civil
citation.
the
officers
had
no
reason
to
suspect
any
of
the
car's
occupants
of
criminal
activity.
during
the
traffic
stop,
one
of
the
officers
asked
johnson
to
exit
the
vehicle
and
he
complied.
suspecting
that
johnson
was
armed,
the
officer
patted
him
down
and
discovered
a
gun
near
his
waist.
charged
with
possession
of
a
weapon
by
a
prohibited
possessor,
johnson
moved
to
bluff
the
admission
of
the
gun
into
evidence
on
the
ground
that
police
acquisition
of
the
weapon
was
the
proof
of
an
unlawful
search.
the
trial
judge
denied
the
motion
and
the
jury
convicted
johnson
but
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction.
absent
reason
to
believe
johnson
was
involved
in
criminal
activity,
the
arizona
appeals
court
held
the
police
officer
had
no
right
to
pat
him
down
for
weapons,
this
was
all
the
court
said,
even
if
the
officer
had
reason
to
suspect
that
the
vehicle
occupant
was
armed
and
dangerous
and
therefore,
a
threat
to
the
officers'
safety.
the
arizona
supreme
court
denied
review.
we
voted
to
hear
the
case
and
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
arizona
court
of
appeals.
this
court
has
held
that
once
a
motor
vehicle
has
been
lawfully
detained
for
a
traffic
violation,
police
officers
without
offending
the
fourth
amendment
may
order
all
occupants
out
of
the
car,
driver,
and
passengers
alike.
the
very
same
concern
for
officer
and
public
safety,
the
court
observed,
justifies
the
exit
order
whether
the
occupant
ordered
out
is
the
driver
or
a
passenger.
for
the
duration
of
a
traffic
stop,
we
recently
confirmed
a
police
officer
effectively
and
lawfully
seizes
everyone
in
the
vehicle,
the
driver
and
all
passengers.
in
a
traffic
stop
setting,
we
accordingly
hold
the
first
terry
condition,
a
permissible
investigatory
stop
is
met
whenever
it
is
lawful
for
the
police
to
detain
an
automobile
and
its
occupants
pending
inquiry
into
the
traffic
violation.
to
justify
the
stop,
the
police
need
not
have
an
addition
cause
to
believe
any
occupant
of
the
vehicle
is
involved
in
criminal
activity.
to
justify
a
patdown
of
the
driver
or
a
passenger
during
a
traffic
stop
however,
just
as
in
the
case
of
a
pedestrian
reasonably
suspected
of
criminal
activity,
the
police
must
harbor
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
person
subjected
to
the
frisk
is
armed
and
therefore
dangerous
to
the
safety
of
the
police
and
public.
because
it
was
reasonable
for
the
police
officer
to
suspect
from
what
he
observed
while
johnson
was
still
seated
in
the
car
that
he
was
armed
and
dangerous,
admission
of
his
gun
into
evidence
did
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
the
court's
opinion
is
unanimous.
