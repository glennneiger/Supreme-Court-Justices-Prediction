justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
didn't
hear
your
--
your
first
--
in
your
opening.
did
you
say
that
mimms
established
that
it's
likely
that
he's
armed
and
dangerous?
i
missed
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
sure
it
wasn't,
but
i
--
i
missed
what
you
said
on
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
--
so
in
your
view,
or
i
suppose
the
government's
view
--
well,
i'll
let
the
government
argue
for
itself.
in
your
view,
if
the
officer
is
just
looking
for
the
man
in
the
gray
overcoat
and
he
stops
someone
on
the
street
and
says,
have
you
seen
a
man
with
a
gray
overcoat,
and
the
person
says,
well,
i
saw
something
like
that,
can
he
just
suddenly
spin
him
around
and
pat
--
and
pat
that
person?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
guess
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
there
is
a
--
a
stop
of
the
passenger
and
an
interrogation
of
the
passenger,
the
passenger
can't
say,
incidentally,
this
is
consensual,
and
thereby
avoid
a
pat
down?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
it
seems
to
me
there
is
some
indication
that
that's
what
happened
here
if
you
credit
the
police
officer's
testimony.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
you
can
have
consent
within
the
--
the
context
of
a
stop
that
has
not
yet
ceased.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
white
light
is
on.
i
don't
want
to
--
but
your
opening
argument
that
you
presented
indicated
that
a
seizure
is
not
necessary.
you
--
you
wanted
a
further
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
officer
believes
that
a
person
is
armed
and
might
be
dangerous,
then
they
can
pat
down.
that's
--
that's
the
rule
that
you
proposed,
i
thought.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i
disagree
with
that.
the
holding
there
was
that
the
passenger
was
stopped,
the
passenger
was
seized,
so
this
was
a
pat
down
in
the
context
of
an
ongoing
seizure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
even
--
even
if
that's
true,
why
don't
we
accept
mimms
with
the
gloss
of
brendlin?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
--
but
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
we
didn't
think
it
was
a
factual
question
in
--
in
brendlin.
in
--
in
brendlin,
we
said
7
--
"even
if
the
wrongdoing
is
only
bad
driving,
the
passenger
will
expect
to
be
subject
to
some
scrutiny,
and
his
attempt
to
leave
the
scene
would
be
so
obviously
likely
to
prompt
an
objection
from
the
officer
that
no
passenger
would
feel
free
to
leave
in
the
first
place.
"
and
that's
why
we
held
there
was
a
seizure.
you're
basically
arguing
with
the
premise
of
brendlin.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
brendlin
says
no
passenger
would
like
--
would
feel
free
to
leave
during
the
course
of
the
investigation.
and
--
and
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that
as
a
--
as
a
commonsense
matter.
it
would
be
amazing
to
me
that
this
fellow
said:
i'm
not
going
to
talk
to
you
anymore.
i
am
leaving.
and
--
and
the
--
and
the
police
officer
would
allow
it,
particularly
when
the
police
officer,
we
know,
searched
the
person.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
--
you
don't
concede
in
this
case,
or
do
you,
that
trevizo
had
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
johnson
was
armed
and
dangerous?
that
has
not
been
found?
we're
just
assuming
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--for
purposes
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
even
if
you
do
not
prevail,
we
would
have
to
remand
on
that
point?
