doesn't
the
officer
need
--
need
justification
for
a
stop,
for
a
fourth
amendment
seizure,
whether
because
of
a
traffic
violation
or
because
of
suspicion
of
criminal
activity
and
then,
in
addition
to
that,
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
is
dangerous?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
that
would
be
--
i
thought
that
was
your
argument.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
the
context
of
a
traffic
stop,
you
don't
need
--
as
to
the
passenger
and
the
driver,
you
don't
need
suspicion
of
criminal
activity.
the
person
has
been
seized
as
a
result
of
the
stop,
and
then
if
you
add
on
to
that
the
reasonable
suspicion
of
danger
to
the
officer,
that
would
be
sufficient.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

well,
you
keep
emphasizing
that
this
is
an
urban
area,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
going
to
lead
to
a
test
that's
impossible
to
administer.
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
circumstances
in
which
the
passenger
in
a
car
that
is
stopped
will
not
think
for
practical
reasons
that
there's
much
alternative
but
to
wait
until
the
driver
is
permitted
to
get
back
in
the
car
and
drive
away.
all
of
those
would
fall
under
your
--
your
urban
category,
wouldn't
they?
if
it's
night
--
suppose
this
was
a
dangerous
area.
suppose
this
was
in
an
area
that
was
the
turf
of
a
rival
gang,
so
it
really
wouldn't
be
very
practical
for
this
person
to
start
walking
down
the
street.
there
are
not
just
urban
areas
and
rural
areas;
there
are
expressways
in
urban
areas;
there
are
suburban
areas.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

all
of
those
things
would
--
you'd
have
to
draw
a
line
taking
all
of
those
things
into
account?
