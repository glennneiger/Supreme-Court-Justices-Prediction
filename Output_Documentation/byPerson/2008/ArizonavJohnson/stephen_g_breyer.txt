g.

what
are
the
facts
that
show
that
a
reasonable
person
in
the
passenger's
position
would
have
believed
himself
free
to
terminate
the
encounter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
the
facts
that
show
that
the
person
who
was
searched,
what's
his
name?
mr.
johnson
--
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
are
the
facts
that
suggest
that
he
thought
he
was
free
to
terminate
that
encounter
with
the
police?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
would
say
we've
held
a
lot
that
that's
just
beside
the
point.
if
you
stop
a
car
for
a
traffic
stop,
you
can
search
it
for
all
kinds
of
things.
you
can
do
all
kinds
of
things
not
related.
so
if
that's
what
they're
relying
on,
i
suspect
that
that's
not
right,
that
it
had
to
do
with
a
different
subject
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
lawfully
stopped.
all
right.
go
ahead.
i
want
to
get
all
of
them
in
front
of
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
is,
how
did
she
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
she
said,
"you
can
leave
whatever
time
you
want?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
standing
there
and
the
policeman
is
in
front
of
you,
and
they
have
stopped
the
car,
and
the
woman
who
is
the
policeman
says,
i
want
to
search
you.
do
you
think
you're
free
to
leave?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
then.
so
now
we
have
got
two
of
them.
what's
the
third?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
was
on
the
highway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
was
in
an
urban
area.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
stopped
in
an
urban
area.
the
policeman
says
you
are
stopped,
and
you
are
stopped
lawfully.
will
you
get
out
of
the
car?
yes.
the
policeman
begins
to
search
for
the
--
the
gun.
fine.
you
think
you're
free
to
leave?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
fourth?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
fourth?
i
just
want
to
get
them
all
out
here.
is
there
anything
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so,
what
they
say
is
a
reasonable
person
would
have
found
--
felt
that
he
could
just
say
good-bye,
and
he
would
have
felt
this
even
though
the
car
was
stopped
lawfully,
she
asked
him
to
get
out
of
the
car,
and
she
began
to
search
him
for
a
gun.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
can
we
not
reverse
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
saying
if
the
question
is
whether
the
person
reasonably
thought
at
the
time
of
the
search
he
could
leave,
there's
certainly
a
strong
claim
here
that
he
could
not
reasonably
or
he
did
not
reasonably
think
he
could
leave.
as
long
as
that
is
so,
the
issue
in
front
of
us
is
when
you
stop
a
person,
a
policeman
in
the
course
of
your
duties,
and
that
person
thinks
that
he
cannot
reasonably
leave,
and
you
believe
reasonably
that
he's
armed,
can
you
pat
him
down?
well,
asked
that
way,
certainly
a
strong
argument,
the
answer
is
yes,
if
you
don't
want
to
be
killed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
we
go
beyond.
i
mean,
once
we
go
beyond,
i
become
a
little
at
sea
as
to
what
the
answers
are
because
policemen
do
things
other
than
investigate
crime.
a
policeman
is
on
protective
duty.
the
individual
he
is
protecting
is
approached
by
a
member
of
the
crips
gang
who
has
a
bulge
in
his
pocket.
can
the
police,
with
reasonable
grounds
to
think
that
that
person
is
armed,
pat
down
that
person?
or
is
he
supposed
to
wait
until
the
gun
comes
out
of
the
pocket
and
the
person
who
is
being
protected
is
shot?
a
policeman
is
on
a
bridge.
somebody
stops
the
car
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge.
traffic
is
held
up
in
all
directions.
the
policeman
goes
to
try
to
remove
the
car
from
the
bridge.
in
the
back
seat
is
a
member
of
the
crips
gang
with
a
bulge
in
his
pocket.
is
the
policeman
supposed
to
ignore
that?
i
mean,
policemen
do
many
things,
and
once
you
tell
me
that
we're
going
beyond
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
can
think
of
all
kinds
of
hypotheticals
that
aren't
so
hypothetical,
and
i
become
uncertain
about
when
the
policeman
can
and
when
he
cannot.
so,
how
do
you
respond?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
dispute
on
the
underlying
facts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here,
what
are
the
facts?
that
is,
this
happened
quite
close
to
the
beginning
of
the
--
of
the
stop,
didn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
don't
know.
i
--
i
read
this.
but
it
said
--
i
mean
i
thought,
from
judging
it,
that
it
did
happen
within
a
few
minutes
of
the
--
of
the
beginning.
they
were
still
talking
to
the
driver.
we
know
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
don't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
there
any
reason
to
think
it
was
half
an
hour?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
lawful
to
possess
a
firearm?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
he
a
convicted
felon?
