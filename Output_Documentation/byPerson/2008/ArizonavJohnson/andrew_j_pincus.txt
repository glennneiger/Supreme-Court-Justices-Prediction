mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
other
side
made
clear
that
its
principal
argument
is
that
terry
should
be
revisited
and
that
the
two
tests
that
terry
prescribed
for
a
pat-down
search,
that
there
be
reasonable
suspicion
--
a
crime
is
afoot
and
reasonable
suspicion
of
armed
and
dangerous
be
revised
so
that
all
that
is
required
for
a
pat-down
search
is
the
second
terry
standard.
we
think--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
first
of
all,
let
me--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
i
think
the
officer
can
--
if
--
i
think
it's
important
to
make
clear
that
the
sliver
of
cases
we're
dealing
with
here
are
cases
where
there
is
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
armed
and
dangerousness
but
not
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
crime
--
criminal
activity
is
afoot.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
if
there
really
is--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--if
he
reasonably
believes
he
could
be
shot,
your
honor,
then
probably
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
--
that
criminal
activity
may
be
afoot
because
he'll
have--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
this
goes
a
little
bit
to
justice
souter's
comment
in
the
first
part
of
the
argument.
these
two
standards
are
--
are
somewhat
--
are
mutually
reinforcing,
as
we
discuss
in
our
brief.
and
if,
indeed,
as
here,
the
state
is
only
arguing
armed
and
dangerousness,
and
not
arguing
that
criminal
activity
is
afoot,
it's
clearly
putting
itself
at
the
low
end
of
the
armed
and
dangerousness
scale.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
--
i
think
that
you're
right,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
the
second
argument
that
they
make,
and
--
and
our
answer
to
that
argument
is
that
we
don't
think
that
mr.
johnson
was
seized
at
the
time
the
pat
down
occurred,
as
the
court
of
appeals
here
found.
the
other
side
seems
to
ignore
the
fact
that
there
is
an
actual
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals,
looking
at
the
facts
of
the
situation,
that
there
wasn't
a
seizure.
and
so--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
a
couple
of
things,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
court
has
never
discussed
--
in
wilson,
it
actually
reserved
the
question
of
what
is
the
duration
of
the
seizure
of
a
passenger--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--we
don't
have
any
duration,
but
the
question
--
but
i
think
an
important
question
is
does
the
seizure
of
the
passenger
necessarily
in
all
cases
coextend
with
the
seizure
of
the
driver?
this
stop
was
in
an
urban
area.
it
might
be
one
thing
if
it's
a
stop
on
a
highway
where
there's
really
no
place
for
the
passenger
to
go.
this
was
a
stop
in
a
--
and
where
there
are
concerns
about
the
safety
of
a
passenger
who
is
allowed
to
wander
off
and
the
potential
liability
of
the
police.
here
the
stop
was
in
an
urban
area,
and
--
and
if
the
--
brendlin
says
that
initially,
clearly
the
passenger
was
seized,
but
the
question
is
how
long
does
that
--
that
seizure
last?
if
the
state--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
let
me
tick
off
some--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
factors
that
we
--
we
rely
on,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
just
as
a
legal
matter,
the
court
has
said
in
caballes
and
other
cases
that
the
scope
of
a
fourth
amendment
intrusion
turns
on
the
purpose.
here
we
say
the
scope
of
the
seizure
of
the
passenger
should
turn
on
the
ability
to
secure
the
scene.
if
the
passenger
is
not
involved
in
what
--
in
the
facts
that
gave
rise
to
the
stop
--
if
it's
clear,
for
example,
quickly
that
the
passenger
doesn't
own
the
vehicle,
the
reasons
that
--
the
driver
owns
the
vehicle,
the
stop
--
the
basis
for
the
stop
relates
to
the
passenger
--
we
don't
see
what
the
basis
is
for,
in
an
urban
setting
at
least,
for
any
further
seizure
of
the
passenger.
there's
a--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--we're
not
relying
entirely
on
--
on
what
i
just
said.
but
we
don't--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
we're
not
relying
--
we're
rejecting
that
assumption.
we
--
we
don't
rest
entirely
on
the
notion
that
the
--
that
the
seizure
of
the
passengers
as
a
matter
of
law
has
to
end.
we
think
there
are
special
facts
here
that
show
that
--
that
support
the
idea
that
the
seizure
was
over.
but
i
think
one
of
them--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
basically
there
was
this
interaction
separate
from
the
interaction
with
the
driver
to
the
extent
the
passenger
--
brendlin
says
the
passenger,
one
of
the
reasons
the
passenger
would
feel
that
he
or
she
is
seized
is
because
of
his
or
her
relationship
to
the
driver
and
to
the
stop
here.
this
interaction--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--proceeded
separately.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
part
--
as
the
lower
court
found
here,
it's
part
--
it's
a
relevant
circumstance.
this
is
a
totality-of-the-circumstance
test.
the
court
of
appeals
here
looked
at
that
as
one
fact,
looked
at
the
officer's
subjective
intention--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--to
the
extent
--
i
think
the
question
here
is
what's
--
one
question
is
what's
communicated
to
the
passenger.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
if
the
officer
had
said
in
terms,
would
you
mind
stepping
out
of
the
car
so
i
can
ask
you
some
questions
unrelated
to
the
stop
about
your
hometown,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
statement
by
the
officer
would
provide
some
pretty
strong
indication
that
the
seizure
was
over
and
that
this
was
a
separate
investigation,
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
seizure.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
court
has
said
that
the
officer--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--the
court
has
said
that
the
officer
can
ask
those
questions.
the
court
hasn't
said
the
--
what
the
impact
of
that
is
on
the
seizure.
and
here
the
officer
certainly
believed
that
her
conduct
and
her
words
and
her
conversation
--
which
we
don't
know
how
long
it
lasted
or
if
there
were
a
number
of
questions
--
communicated
to
the
--
to
the
individual,
to
mr.
johnson,
the
idea
that
this
was
a
consensual
encounter.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it
is
subjective.
and
i
guess
i
would
also
point,
your
honor,
to
the
court's
decision
in
--
in
drayton,
which
dealt
with
the
question
in
a
somewhat
different
context,
at
a
bus
search
and
whether
or
not
passengers
on
a
bus
would
feel
that
they
were
seized
when
there
were
officers
in
the
front
of
the
bus
and
they
were
asking
questions.
and
to
us,
although
this
is
obviously
the
converse,
a
lot
of
the
analysis
in
drayton,
which
showed
that
--
which
concluded
that
there
wasn't
a
seizure
there,
because
of
the
--
because
people
ultimately
would
feel
free
to
come
and
go,
given
the
nature
of
the
interaction--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--right.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
think
it's
quite
clear,
justice
ginsburg,
that
there's
no
question
here
that
--
that
there
was
a
consent
to
the
pat
down.
i
think
the
lower
courts
concluded
and
the
other
side
hasn't
sought
review
that
there
was
no
consent
to
the
pat
down
here.
i
think
the
reason
that
drayton
is
--
is
relevant
is
that
that's
a
case
where
the
question
for
the
court
was,
would
these
people
feel
free
to
terminate
the
encounter?
and
the
court
concluded
yes,
they
would.
and
we
think,
given
the
different
situation
of
the
passenger,
it's
true
that
--
that
brendlin
found
the
passenger
seized.
to
some
extent,
that
was
to
give
the
passenger
a
shield,
not
to
be
used
as
the
sword
for
further
interrogation
of
the
passenger.
it
recognized
the
reality
that
at
the
outset
surely
the
passenger
is
seized.
if--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
you
know,
berkemer
says,
in
the
context
even
of
a
--
of
a
traffic
seizure,
miranda
warnings
aren't
necessarily
necessary.
but
--
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that,
given
the
--
the
different
basis
for
the
seizure
here,
it's
that
initial
conclusion
that
at
the
outset,
yes,
but
--
but
that
person,
unlike
the
--
unlike
the
driver
who
is
the
target
of
the
police
activity
and
therefore
a
reasonable
conclusion
for
the
driver
is
he's
seized
until
the
end
of
that
activity,
the
passenger
is
not
the
target
of
the
traffic
stop.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
that
the
--
that
the
interaction
with
the
officer
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
of
the
stop.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--that
the
officer
herself
believed
that
she
had
communicated
the
fact
that
the
interaction
was
voluntary.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--she
did
not
do
it
that
way.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
although
the
court--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
the
third
is
that
it
was
in
--
it
was
not
a
road
stop
in
an
abandoned
area,
where
a--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
it
was
in
an
urban
area,
actually--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--where
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
obviously
it
wasn't--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
think
we've
gotten
them
all
out
onto
the
table.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
your
honor,
a
couple
of
things.
i
don't
think
that
the
question
is
at
the
moment
--
clearly,
at
the
moment
she
was
conducting
the
pat-down
search,
he
was
seized.
but
if
that
were
the
test,
then
even
in
the
--
in
the
terry
situation,
the
person
is
obviously
in
fact
seized
at
the
time
that
the
pat-down
search
is
conducted,
but
that's
not
--
the
question
is
whether
there
was
--
in
the
moments
before,
there
was
a
basis
to
immobilize
that
person.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
--
i
guess
a
couple
of
answers
to
that,
justice
breyer:
first
of
all,
if
this
is
just
a
case
about
whether
the
lower
court
made
a
correct
determination
about
whether
there
was
a
seizure
or
not,
there's
not
--
maybe
there's
not
much
to
the
case.
we
think
the
lower
court
did
make
the
right
determination
for
the
--
for
the
reasons
that
i
gave.
and
i
should
say,
it
seems
--
it
does
seem
to
me,
and
i
was
trying
to
get
at
this
point
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question,
there
are
two
related
questions
here.
one
is
the
--
what
a
reasonable
person
in
mr.
johnson's
position
would
believe?
one
is
what
is
the
authority
of
an
officer
in
terms
of
the
duration
for
which
a
passenger
may
be
seized?
one
answer--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
--
that
may
not
be
--
by
itself,
it
may
not
be
enough.
we
think,
together
with
the
other
factors
here,
the
fact--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
the
fact
that
the
officer
believed,
therefore
her
tone,
we
have
to
assume,
the
way
she
--
that
she
spoke
in
the
way
her
subjective
intent
indicated,
that
she
believed
that
what
was
going
on
here
was
a
conversation
in
--
in
an
effort
to
get
gang
information--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
he
was
supposed
to
assume
that
--
that
it
was
consensual
because
of
her
tone,
because
that's
--
that
was
her
intent.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
that
--
first
of
all,
a
couple
of
reactions:
first
of
all,
i
think
that
it
is
important,
and
i
--
i
alluded
to
this
earlier,
the
--
the
sliver
of
cases
we're
dealing
with
here
are
cases
in
which
there
is
reasonable
--
allegedly
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
someone
is
armed
and
dangerous,
but
not
reasonable
suspicion
that
criminal
activity
is
afoot.
those
two
standards
are
mutually
reinforcing.
in
most
cases
where
there
is
serious
evidence
that
someone
is
armed
and
dangerous,
you're
going
to
have
a
very
--
almost
certainly
you
will
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
crime
is
afoot
because
the
dangerousness
part
requires
--
means
you'll
have
suspicion
of
an
assault
or
some
other
kind
of
activity.
so
i--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--that
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
here
determined
--
its
decision
rested
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
consensual
encounter.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
i
think
it's
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
your
honor.
so
i
think,
with
respect
to
the
underlying
facts,
you
probably
have
to
find
that
--
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
don't
think
the
underlying
facts
are
disputed.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
that
is
--
that
is
the
disputed
question:
whether
--
or
whether
a
reasonable
person
in
his
position--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
not
at
the
suppression
hearing.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
it's
the
totality
of
the
circumstances:
the
tone
of
the
officer,
the
fact
it
was
in
an
urban
area
where
there
were
some
place
to--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
the
--
the
officer
herself
testified
about
what
her
intent
was.
and
i
think
most
people,
when
they
--
if
that's
their
intent,
it's
carried
through
in
how
they
interact
with
someone.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--it
--
it
would
be
a
factual
question
in
every
case
as
it
is
in
the
typical
fourth
amendment
arrest
case
about
whether
someone
is
seized.
in
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
absolutely
not.
i
think
brendlin
clearly
holds
that
there
is
a
seizure
at
the
outset.
the
question
that
brendlin
does
not
explicitly
address,
and
it's
one
the
court
explicitly
reserved--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
i
mean,
i
think
it
--
it
may
depend
upon
the
other
facts
in
that
--
in
that
situation,
your
honor.
this--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--we
don't
know.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
--
we
actually
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
don't.
we
know
that
the
--
that
the
conversation
seemed
to
be
--
the
interaction
seemed
to
have
started
shortly
after
the
interaction
with
the
driver.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
don't
know
how
they
--
how
long
they--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--we
just
don't
know.
the
record
doesn't
say.
we
don't
know.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
your
honor,
we
think
if
--
if
there
was
a
seizure,
then
--
then
we
think
there
is
a
second
question,
which
is
even
if
the
person
was
seized,
the
--
it's
not
clear
to
us
that
the
court's
precedents
say
that
--
that
that
automatically
permits
a
pat
down
on
armed
and
dangerousness.
my
friends
rely
on
mimms.
the
court
in
mimms
made
very
clear
--
and,
in
fact,
as
we
recite
on
pages
31
to
32
of
our
brief
--
footnote
5
in
mimms
says
that
the
reason
for
the
pat
down
there
was
that
"once
the
driver
alighted,
the
officer
had
independent
reason
to
suspect
criminal
activity
and
present
danger.
"
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
pat-down
search
was
permissible.
so
the
court
hasn't
said
that
in
the
context
of
a
roadside
stop,
once
you
are
seized
in
this
--
at
least
for
a
passenger
--
a
somewhat
different
sense
than
a
terry
seizure
based
on
articulable
suspicion
about
that
person's
criminal
activity,
that
is
enough.
we
think
the
relevant
standard
there
is
supplied
by
the
court's
decisions
in
--
in
summers
and
associated
cases,
which
is
--
which
say
the
officer
can
control
the
scene,
and
that
might
allow
a
pat-down
search
if
that's
what
the
officer
is
trying
to
do.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
well,
that's
--
that's
part
of
the
concern,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
even
though
--
even
though,
again,
there's
no
particularized
suspicion
about
that
passenger.
so
this
is
a
pretty
dramatic
expansion
of
the
officer's
ability
to
--
to
search,
and
we
think
it
should
be
cabined
very
closely
to
those
situations
in
which
there
really
is
a
threat
of
armed
and
dangerous.
and
i
was
saying
before,
it
--
"armed
and
dangerousness"
and
"a
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
crime
is
afoot.
"
are
mutually
reinforcing.
if
one
isn't
present,
if
the
state,
as
here,
is
arguing
that
one
isn't
present,
it
tends
to
cast
doubt
on
whether
the
other
is
present.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
what
you
are
--
what
you
are
getting
at
in
your
--
in
your
question--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--as
it
is
blurry
when
the
--
in
the
converse
situation
when
the
question
is--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--no,
i'm
talking
about
the
drayton
situation,
your
honor.
when
the
--
when
the
question
is,
has
a
consensual
interaction
morphed
into
a
seizure,
then
there
is
also
a
--
a
--
it's
an
uncertain
line.
but
the
court
has
said
that
there
it's
a
totality-of-the-circumstances
test
and,
obviously
--
sort
of
the
shoes
are
all
on
the
other
feet
there,
because
the
law
enforcement
doesn't
want
that
to
happen.
and
so
it's
arguing
that
the
facts
don't
amount
to
a
seizure,
and
here
we're
sort
of
in
the
converse
situation.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
absolutely
not.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
the
lower
court
assumed
it
for
the
purposes
of
decision--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--yes,
that
point
would
have
to
be
remanded
so
that
the
court
below
could
address
it.
just
to
--
just
to
return
to
the
final
point,
the
--
the
sliver
of
cases
we're
talking
about
here,
"armed
and
dangerousness,
but
not
crime
afoot.
"
it's
a
very
small
sliver.
the
government
hasn't
shown
that
that's
a
real
problem
that
has
to
be
taken
care
of.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
if
the
officers
really
had
believed
that
--
that
there
was
proof
of
armed
and
dangerousness,
why
wouldn't
they
have
argued
that
they
had
proof
that
crime
was
afoot,
given
that
they
knew
that
mr.
johnson
was
a
felon?
we
think
that
the
reason
that
the
state
took
that
off
the
table
was
it
doesn't
have
a
lot
of
confidence
in--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--if
you're
a
convicted
felon?
no.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
he
had
admitted
to
the
officer
that
he
had
engaged
in
burglary.
in
fact,
that's
one
of
the
reasons
to
show
that
he's
not
dangerous
is
that
he
was
very
forthcoming
about
the
fact
that
he
had
a
conviction.
so
the
fact
that
the
state
took
that
off
the
table
and
didn't
rely
on
it,
we
think,
shows
(a)
that
they
don't
have
a
lot
of
confidence
that
there's
real
armed
and
dangerousness
here
and
the
danger,
in
a
systemic
sense,
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
of
relying
only
on
that
prong
as
the
basis
for
cabining
officer
discretion.
as
justice
kennedy
said
in
a
separate
opinion
in
wilson,
it's
very
easy
to
--
to
conduct
a
lawful
search--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--i
think
it
is
the
dangerousness
element,
your
honor,
if
they
are
"armed
and
dangerousness",
which
is
the
test
that
the
court
set
out
in
terry
and
that
the
--
it's
the
test
that
my
colleagues
are
asking
for.
"dangerous",
to
me,
connotes
a
threat
to
someone.
and
it's
a
very
small
step,
i
think,
between
being
a
threat
to
someone
and
having
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
an
assault
may
be
committed.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
we
--
we
agree.
we
argue
very
strenuously
that
he
wasn't
dangerous,
but
--
but
i
--
i
think
the
key
point
here
is
--
is
that
it
--
it
may
well
be
a
sliver
of
cases,
but
removing
the
sort
of
mutually
reinforcing
nature
of
these
two
tests
threatens
to
really
downgrade
the
standard
in
a
way
that
officer
discretion--
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
--well,
let
me
give
three
quick
answers
to
those:
first
of
all,
he
looked
--
this
was
an
unmarked
car,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
a
--
a
very
reasonable
inference
is
he
looked
behind
because
he
was
surprised
that
there
were
all
of
a
sudden
flashing
lights
and
a
siren
on
a
car.
the
gang
colors,
as
the
lower
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
here
noted,
although
mr.
johnson
was
wearing
blue,
the
driver
was
wearing
red.
if
these
were
really
gang
colors,
it
--
it's
not
consistent
with
the
conclusion
that
they
were
gang
colors
to
have
people
of
different
colors
who
were
rival
gangs
in
the
same
car.
and
the
third
thing
is,
as
lower
courts
have
found,
acknowledging
prior
criminal
convictions
is
a
basis
for
concluding
that
someone
is
not
dangerous
because
they
were
forthcoming.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
don't
think
this
court
has
come
down
one
way
or
--
or
the
other,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
--
it
seems
to
me
there
--
there
is
a
requirement
of
immediate
danger.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
i
don't
think
if
he's
just
a
fishy
character,
it's
enough.
i
think
the
reason
is
immediate
threat
to
safety.
mr.
andrew
j.
pincus
thank
you.
