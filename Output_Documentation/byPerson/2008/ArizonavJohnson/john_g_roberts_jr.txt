chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
07-1122,
arizona
v.
johnson.
mr.
parkhurst.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
that
there's
a
point
in
an
interaction
that
begins
with
a
traffic
stop,
begins
with
a
seizure,
at
which
the
nature
of
that
interaction
is
changed
so
that
it's
no
longer
--
so
that
it
becomes
a
consensual
interaction
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--maybe
i
should
rephrase
the
question.
do
you
agree
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
an
officer
to
conduct
a
pat
down
after
an
initial
seizure
while
that
same
interaction
still
continues?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
heytens.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
that
there
is
a
point
at
which
the
encounter
initiated
by
the
traffic
stop
changes
in
some
way
that
a
pat
down
is
no
longer
justified?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
the
encounter
is
--
by
"the
encounter
is
over",
do
you
mean
that
they
separate;
they're
no
longer
together?
my
question
is
whether
or
not
it's
a
continuing
encounter
but
transforms
somehow
in
its
quality
so
that
the
pat
down
is
no
longer
justified.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
there's
an
argument,
anyway,
that
even
though
the
initial
seizure
is
over,
the
consensual
encounter
continues.
and
at
some
point
the
officer,
as
a
result
of
whatever
happens
during
that
consensual
exchange,
becomes
concerned
for
her
safety.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
pincus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
we've
been
talking
about
the
officer
approaching
somebody
on
the
street
who
has
the
bulge
in
his
pocket.
what
if
the
person
with
the
bulge
in
his
pocket
approaches
the
officer?
can
the
officer
at
that
point,
even
if
he
has
no
suspicion
that
crime
is
afoot,
conduct
a
pat
down?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
--
this
is
like
the
rule
in
the
old
west
that
the
sheriff
has
to
wait
for
the
defendant
to
draw
first?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
in
response
to
my--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--one
moment.
in
response
to
my
hypothetical,
even
though
the
officer
reasonably
thinks
he
is
in
a
situation
where
he
could
be
shot,
he
can't
do
anything
about
it,
not
even
a
simple
pat
down,
even
though
he
did
not
initiate
the
contact,
somebody
comes
up
to
him?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
let's
just
say
it's
like
this
case:
the
guy
coming
up
--
he's
wearing
the
colors
of
the
--
of
the
crips
gang,
and
he
has
a
bulge
in
his
pocket.
it's
not
a
crime
to
wear
that
type
of
clothing.
it
may
not
be
a
crime
to
have
a
bulge
in
your
pocket,
but
he
nonetheless
has
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
he's
being
--
he's
in
a
threatening
situation,
even
though
he
has
no
basis
for
thinking
that
a
crime
is
being
committed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
giving
up
a
shield
here,
i
take
it?
instead
of
--
if
instead
of
a
pat
down,
the
officer
said,
where
were
you
last
night
at
10
o'clock,
without
miranda
warnings,
you
would
say,
well,
that's
just
--
that's
just
fine?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
you
look
at
the
first
part
of
that,
what
somebody
in
mr.
johnson's
position
would
believe,
how
does
he
tell?
i
mean,
even
if
the
other
officer
goes
to
the
window
and
starts
asking
the
driver,
"can
i
see
your
insurance
papers.
"
there's
no
representation
that's
why
we
stopped
you,
that's
all
we're
interested
in.
they
may
have
stopped
him
because
they
have
reason
to
believe
that
that
car
was
involved
in
criminal
activity.
they
don't
have
to
disclose
immediately
what's
involved.
so
how
can
the
passenger
know
why
the
officer
is
stopping
the
person
in
the
first
place?
let's
hypothesize
that
he
has
been
involved
in
criminal
activity.
he
may
think,
well,
they've
caught
me
and
they're
just
going
through
this
charade
to
try
to
get
information
about
it
and
make
the
people
feel
comfortable,
whatever.
i
mean,
just
because
he
says,
you
don't
have
insurance
papers,
that's
--
i
don't
think
it's
reasonable
for
the
passenger
to
say,
oh,
this
is
not
about
me.
i
can
get
up
and
leave.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
else?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
is
supposed
to
assume
that
it's
not
about
him
because
of
her
tone?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
hypothesis
about
why
she
--
why
he
was
free
to
leave
is
because
of
the
tone
of
the
arresting
officer?
the
tone
of
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
there's
no
finding
about
the
tone
of
the
officer,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
the
--
why
isn't
the
"seizure"
and
the
"consensual"
aspect
also
mutually
reinforcing
but
kind
of
blurring
into
each
other?
it
seems
to
me
it's
an
awfully
difficult
decision
for
the
officer
to
make:
well,
i
stopped
this
person.
i
know
under
brendlin
that
he
is
seized,
and
i'm
engaged
in
a
dialogue,
and
i
have
to
worry
that
at
some
point
he
thinks
he's
free
to
leave.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
seem
--
your
argument
assumes
a
fairly
bright
line
between
the
point
at
which
the
individual
is
seized
and
the
point
at
which
the
interaction
becomes
a
consensual
search.
and
i'm
just
saying
that
in
the
run
mine
of
cases,
that
line
is
going
to
be
very
blurry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
the
converse
situation
is
that
so
long
as
the
interaction
continues,
it
is
a
seizure,
and
the
officer
can
take
reasonable
steps,
the
pat
down,
to
protect
her
safety.
that
doesn't
have
a
line-drawing
issue.
your
position
does.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
parkhurst,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-1122,
arizona
versus
johnson.
