mr.
toby
j.
heytens
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
in
this
case
should
be
reversed
for
one
of
two
independent
reasons.
first,
at
the
time
that
officer
trevizo
performed
this
frisk,
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
erred
when
it
held
that
the
seizure
that
had
been
caused
by
the
initial
traffic
stop
was
already
over.
this
seizure
was
still
ongoing
at
the
time
of
the
frisk.
second,
regardless
of
the
answer
to
that
question,
under
this
court's
decisions
in
mimms
and
wilson,
it
is
constitutionally
reasonable
for
a
police
officer
to
order
any
occupant
out
of
a
vehicle
during
a
lawful
traffic
stop
and
to
frisk
that
individual
if
the
officer
has
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
that
individual
is
armed
and
presently
dangerous
to
the
officer.
in
this
case--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--we
certainly
agree,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
at
some
point
the
encounter
is
over,
and
that
if
it's
in
fact
not
over,
the--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--we
agree
that
at
some
point
a
seizure
can
morph
into
a
consensual
encounter.
we
don't
have
any
dispute
with
that.
we
would
say
that
the
fundamental
reality
of
this
situation
is
what
the
court
recognized
in
brendlin,
which
is
that,
at
the
time
the
car
pulls
over,
a
reasonable
person
would
understand
himself
to
not
be
free
to
leave
unless
and
until
the
police
officer
says
something
that
makes
fairly
clear
that
the
seizure
is
over
and
he's
free
to
go.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that's
our
--
the
second
argument,
which
is
at
the
end
of
the
day,
we
don't
think
it
matters
whether
he's
seized.
because
whether
he's
seized
or
not,
this
is
still
a
roadside
encounter
with
a
person
who
was
a
passenger
in
a
vehicle
that
was
pulled
over
for
some--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--well,
i
guess
the
first
thing
i
want
to
say,
justice
stevens,
is
it's
not
okay
to
think
maybe
he
might
be
armed.
the
officer
has
to
have
articulable
suspicion.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
okay.
under
those
circumstances
we
think
absolutely,
and
we
think
your
hypothetical--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--it
is
different
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--it
is
different
because
it's
a
roadside
encounter,
and
this
court
has
recognized
again
and
again
and
again--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--i
--
i
agree
with
you,
justice
stevens,
which
is
why
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
don't
--
we
think
that
the
officer,
in
basically
those
facts,
should
be
able
to
perform
a
frisk
on
the
street
as
well.
i
guess
just
--
again
to
say,
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
issue,
because
i--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--we
do
rely
on
the
fact--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--we
think
this
case
is
substantially
easier
because
it's
a
traffic
stop,
because
this--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--because
this
court
has
recognized
again
and
--
let
me
give
you
the
example
of
wilson.
wilson
is
the
case
where
the
court
holds
that
it
is
per
se
reasonable
for
an
officer
to
order
a
passenger
to
get
out
of
the
car.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
i--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--justice
stevens,
i
think
wilson
is
highly
significant
in
this
regard,
because
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
in
wilson
to
point
out
that
there's
no
reason
to
suspect
a
passenger
with
any
illegal
activity
at
all.
the
court
said
you
could
distinguish
mimms
on
the
ground
that
with
regard
to
the
driver
you
have
suspicion
that
he's--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--justice
kennedy,
i
guess
i
would
say
we
disagree
with
this.
the
court
didn't
hold
until
brendlin
that
a
passenger
is
seized
by
virtue
of
the
initial
traffic
stop.
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
in
brendlin
to
say
that
none
of
its
previous
decisions
had
answered
the
question
of
whether
the
passenger
is
seized
by
virtue
of
the
original
traffic
stop.
and
the
court
didn't
even
identify--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--we
think
that
brendlin
is
of
course
absolutely
correct,
and
we
think
the
passenger
was
seized,
and
we
think
fundamentally
that's
why
this
case
is
fairly
easy.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
justice
ginsburg,
we
agree
that
that
is
ultimately
the
correct
fourth
amendment
rule,
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
court
doesn't
need
to
decide
whether
it
agrees
with
us
on
this
point
--
that
point,
excuse
me,
to
resolve
this
case,
because
there
are
two
very
important
distinctions
between
this
case
and
that
one.
the
first
one
is
that
we
know
that
mr.
johnson
was
seized.
this
was
not
a
consensual
encounter.
we
know
under
this
court's
holding
in
brendlin
that
there
was
a
seizure
of
mr.
johnson
in
this
case.
and
the
question
is
whether
anything
happened
in
this
case
to
unseize
him,
and
we
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
clearly
no.
and
then
the
second
reason
is
this
court
has
recognized
over
and
over
again
that
traffic
stops
pose
unique
heightened
dangers
to
police
officers,
and
so
regardless
of
what
the
rule
is
outside
the
traffic
stop--
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
--we
do
think
that
at
the
end
of
the
day,
justice
stevens,
the
overriding
command
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
that
a
police
officer's
conduct
must
be
judged
by
a
reasonableness
standard,
and
we
think
that
overriding
command
allows
police
officers
to
take
limited
and
appropriate
steps
to
protect
their
own
safety.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
at
the
end
of
the
day,
justice
souter,
that
is
our
view.
i
think
that
case
is
harder
than
this
case,
and
let
me
explain
why.
it
seems
like
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
predicated
expressly
on
the
notion
that
unless
a
police
officer
has
suspicion
of
crime,
he
can
just
avoid
dangerous
people,
like
any
of
the
rest
of
us
can
choose
to
avoid
them.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
i'm
not
aware
of
whether
we've
had
to
take
this
position
before,
justice
stevens.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
i'm
not
aware
of
whether
we've
taken
this
position
or
not
in
any
previous
case,
because
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
that
raises
the
issue
that's
raised
by
the
going
up
to
someone
on
the
street
hypothetical.
we
have
certainly
consistently
taken
the
position
that,
in
the
context
of
traffic
stops,
it
is
constitutionally
reasonable
for
police
officers
to
perform
terry
frisks
whenever
they
have
reason
to
believe
that
their
safety
is
in
danger.
as
i
was
saying
to
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
--
excuse
me,
justice
souter,
i
believe
--
i
think
the
problem
in
the
hypothetical
where
the
officer
goes
up
to
someone
on
the
street
is
it's
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
the
police
officer,
like
you
and
me,
should
just
avoid
dangerous
people.
we
think
that's
fundamentally
wrong
about
what
the
nature
of
a
police
officer's
job
is.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
well,
i
--
i
certainly
would
add,
justice
souter,
that
it
has
to
be
a
reasonable
person.
it's
not
that
a
police
officer
can
recite
some
reason.
it's
whether
a
reason
that
a
reasonable
person
in
that
position
would
find
reasonable.
mr.
toby
j.
heytens
well,
i
--
i
guess,
justice
souter,
to
the
extent
you're
concerned
about
that,
i
would
say
the
same
thing
is
true
about
whether
you
have
articulable
suspicion
of
criminal
activity,
and
the
court
has
decided
that
that
risk
is
worth,
you
know,
dealing
with
under
the
context
of
that
question.
so
i
don't
really
understand
why
in
principle
articulable
suspicion
of
armed
and
dangerousness
is
any
different.
i
would
also
say
that
in
this
case,
regardless
of
whether
there
will
be
hard
cases,
the
decision
that
this
court
is
reviewing
is
expressly
predicated
on
the
view
that
officer
trevizo
had
reasonable
suspicion
mr.
johnson
was
armed
and
dangerous.
that's
on
pages
13
and
14
of
the
petition
appendix.
it
is
also
the
predicate
of
the
question
on
which
this
court
granted
review.
the
question
which
this
court
granted
review
presupposes
that
she
had
a
reasonable
suspicion.
thank
you
very
much.
