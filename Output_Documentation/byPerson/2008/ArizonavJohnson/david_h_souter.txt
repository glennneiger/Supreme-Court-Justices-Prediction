justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
your
view
if
an
officer
was
going
down
the
street
and
he
saw
an
individual
as
to
whom
he
had
no
suspicion
that
a
crime
was
being
committed,
had
been
or
was
about
to
be,
but
he
said
that
--
that
guy
looks
like
--
like
trouble
for
anybody
who
has
anything
to
do
with
him.
so
he
goes
up
to
him
and
he
says,
i
want
to
talk
to
you.
and
because
he
has
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
individual
looks
like
trouble,
he
pats
him
down.
is
that
a
good
pat
down?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
the
individual
gives
him
--
gives
him
mean
looks
and
he
has
a
bulge
of
something
on
his
hip?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
in
my
hypothesis,
there
was
nothing
that
would
satisfy
the
first
prong
of
terry.
there's
--
there's
no
lawful
traffic
stop.
there
is
no
indication
that
the
individual
has
committed
a
crime
or
is
about
to
or
is
doing
so.
so
--
so
terry
1
is
blank
in
my
hypothesis,
and
you
nonetheless
conclude
that
as
a
result
of
dirty
looks
and
the
--
the
bulge
of
a
probable
gun
on
the
hip,
the
officer
can
in
effect
initiate
the
--
the
action
with
the
individual
and
pat
him
down.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
take
it,
if
i
understood
your
earlier
answer,
you
would
extend
the
application
of
the
rule
as
you
understand
it
to
the
encounter
simply
on
the
sidewalk
by
a
police
officer
who
has
no
suspicion
that
the
individual
he
wants
to
talk
to
has
been,
is,
or
is
about
to
commit
a
crime,
but
if
the
--
if
the
officer
chooses
to
initiate
the
conversation,
he
then,
in
effect,
if
he
can
articulate
any
suspicion,
like
we'll
say
the
dirty
look
and
the
bulge
on
the
side,
he
can
go
ahead
and
--
and
pat
down.
is
that
--
that
your
view?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's
something
fundamentally
wrong
probably
about
that,
but
the
--
the
--
i
think
the
problem
that
sort
of
drives
the
questioning
is
that
if
you
extend
the
rule
as
far
as
you
want
to
extend
it,
we
have
to
take
into
consideration
that
the
standard
of
articulable
suspicion
is
the
standard
that,
in
practical
terms,
can
pretty
well
always
be
met.
you
can
--
you
know,
benjamin
franklin's
remark:
it's
great
to
be
a
reasonable
person
because
you
can
think
of
a
reason
for
anything
you
do.
[laughter]
and
that's
--
that's
what's
driving
--
at
least
driving
my
questions.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
what
the
officer
cites
is
going
to
be
a
matter
of
fact,
and
the
facts
at
that
point
are
gone.
they're
in
the
past.
and
all
you've
got
is
the
officer
saying,
you
know,
this
is
--
this
is
what
i
perceived.
and
maybe
you've
got
the
--
a
defendant
somewhere
saying,
oh,
no,
it
wasn't
like
that.
but
in
a
--
in
a
situation
like
that,
if
--
if
articulable
suspicion,
in
effect,
can
justify
a
sidewalk
pat
down
without
any
articulation
of
a
basis
to
think
crime
is
afoot,
then
you've
got
a
--
you've
got
a
pretty
wide
open
standard
in
the
real
world.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
we
pursue
that
for
a
minute?
what
--
i
guess
we
--
we
all
start
with
the
common
assumption
that
--
that
there
was
at
least
a
legitimate
stop
to
start
with.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
my
--
my
question
which
--
which
goes
to
who's
right
about
whether
the
seizure
--
the
legitimate
seizure
had
stopped
and
the
consensual
encounter
had
begun,
my
question
is
what
is
it
beyond
the
conclusory
statement
of
the
officer
that
in
effect
justifies
drawing
that
conclusion,
that
the
stop
was
over?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we
know
--
do
we
have
any
evidence
about
duration
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
my
--
my
problem
in
this
case,
i
guess,
in
taking
your
position
is
i
don't
think
we
have
got
an
evidentiary
basis
to
conclude
that
what
we
start
by
assuming
is
a
legitimate
stop
has
in
fact
run
its
course.
i
don't
see
how
we
can
draw
that
conclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
i'm
getting
at.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then,
in
other
words,
you
--
you
are
--
i
--
i'll
be
candid
with
you.
i
would
have
started
with
the
assumption,
based
on
brendlin,
that
if
the
stop
of
the
car
and
its
driver
also
effects
a
stop
and
a
seizure
of
the
passenger,
that
you
start
out
with
the
assumption
that
the
seizure
of
the
passenger
is
going
to
last
for
the
same
duration
as
the
seizure
of
the
car
and
the
driver
unless
you
have
a
good
reason
to
draw
some
line
and
say,
no,
it
doesn't.
and
i
take
it
that
you
are
not
making
that
initial
assumption.
am
i
correct
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
--
i
think
you're
rejecting
it,
aren't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
what
are
those
--
what
are
those
special
facts?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying--
justice
david
h.
souter
--are
you
saying
if
there's
--
if
there's
a
driver
and
a
passenger
and
there
are
two
police
officers,
and
one
police
officer
is
dealing
with
the
driver,
saying,
you
know,
where's
your
insurance
papers
and
so
on,
and
at
the
same
time
the
other
officer
is
questioning
the
--
the
passenger,
are
you
saying
that
that
independent
questioning
of
the
passenger
in
effect
eliminates
the
--
the
passenger's
seizure
as
--
as
following
from
the
seizure
of
the
driver?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
--
i
don't
get
it.
why
should
the
fact
that
an
officer
--
a
separate
officer
is
talking
to
the
passenger
ultimately
have
anything
to
do
with
the
duration
of
the
passenger's
seizure,
absent
a
situation
in
which
officer
two
says,
"by
the
way,
you're
totally
free
to
go?
"
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
strange
situation.
but
short
of
a
strange
situation
like
that,
why
does
the
conversation
with
the
passenger
have
anything
much
to
do
--
have
any
bearing
on
the
--
on
the
length
of
the
passenger's
seizure?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
accept
as
hornbook
law
when
they
are
--
when
the
police
are
--
are
questioning
one
individual
whom
they've
stopped,
let's
say
for
a
traffic
violation,
that
during
that
period
of
seizure,
the
reasonable
period
of
seizure,
the
officer
can
ask
questions
about
other
subjects,
and
that
doesn't
end
the
seizure.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
why
should--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
be
any
different
for
the
passenger?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
want
to
take
up
your
whole
argument
on
this
hobbyhorse
of
mine,
but
i
mean
my
--
my
only
problem
is
i
don't
see
that
we
have
got
an
evidentiary
basis
here
to
say
that,
because
of
the
duration
or
the
mere
fact
of
the
questioning,
there
is
a
reason
to
say
that
as
to
the
passenger,
a
reasonable
passenger
could
say,
i
am
no
longer
seized,
and
--
and
this
encounter
is
totally
consensual.
the
--
the
officer
testified,
no
question
about
it,
but
the
test
is
subjective.
