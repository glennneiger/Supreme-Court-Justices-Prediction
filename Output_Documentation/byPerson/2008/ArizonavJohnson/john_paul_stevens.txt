justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
your
--
your
view
of
the
law
that,
if
the
officer
is
pretty
sure
that
the
--
the
--
that
the
person
he's
having
a
consensual
encounter
with
has
a
gun
--
he
could
see
the
bulge
or
something
--
is
that
sufficient
or
does
he
have
to
have
some
proof
the
--
that
the
person
is
about
to
use
the
gun?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
just
meeting
on
--
on
the
street?
the
officer
meets
the
man
on
the
street
and
asks
him
where
he's
going
or
something
like
that,
and
he
sees
a
--
a
bulge
in
the
pocket
that
is
--
convinces
the
officer
he
has
a
gun,
but
that's
all.
that's
the
only
evidence
of
a
threat
to
the
officer.
is
that
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
says
yes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
parkhurst--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--general
parkhurst,
i
--
i
seem
to
be
a
little
confused
about
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
had
the
--
remember
the
testimony
that
she
thought
the
--
that
the
encounter
had
become
consensual,
which
meant
that
he
was
no
longer
--
in
her
view,
no
longer
under
--
in
custody.
but
are
you
also
saying
she
also
thought
he
was
about
to
assault
her
and,
therefore,
she
was
in
danger?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
seems
some
tension
between
being
both
in
danger
and
saying,
well,
the
arrest
was
all
over.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
--
suppose
it's
a
roadside
encounter
in
which
the
driver
is
changing
a
flat
tire
and
the
officer
stops
and
wants
to
talk
to
him
for
a
while
and
then
he
suddenly
thinks,
well,
maybe
this
guy's
armed.
is
it
okay
for
him
to
go
ahead
and
search
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
he
has
an
articulable
suspicion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
any
different
from
meeting
somebody
on
the
--
on
the
street
corner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
flat
--
my
flat
tire
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
those
are
roadside
encounters
after
a
traffic
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
don't
rely
at
all
on
the
fact
this
is
a
traffic
stop?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
your
second
point,
that
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
easier?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
those
are
all
cases
in
which
there's
a
violation
of
law
that
preceded
the
activity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
asked
you
about
cases
in
which
there's
nothing
other
than
the
officer's
interest
in
patting
down
the
guy
because
he
thinks
he
has
a
gun.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you'd
apply
the
same
rule
if
the
--
if
the
officer
just
stopped
to
help
the
guy
change
his
tire.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
the
department
of
justice
has
ever
taken
this
position
before?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
you
whether
you
have.
you
don't
think
they
have,
do
you?
it's
a
rather
extreme
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
whether
the
man
thought
he
was
free
to
leave.
that's
a
big
--
a
big
dispute,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
he
testify?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
nobody
asked
him
whether
he
thought
he
was
free
to
leave
--
which
would
have
solved
a
lot
of
problems.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pincus,
do
you
agree
with
your
opponents
that
if
you
lose
on
the
seizure
issue,
you
lose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pincus,
i
have
difficulty
accepting
your
suggestion
that
there
is
a
sliver
of
cases.
it
seems
to
me
there
are
a
multitude
of
cases
in
which
officers
might
suspect
somebody
is
armed
but
not
think
criminal
activity
is
afoot,
but
decide
they
would
like
to
pat
him
down.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
argue
that
in
--
in
all
of
this,
this
guy
was
not
dangerous?
