mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
petitioner
montejo
should
be
denied
the
sixth
amendment
protections
of
michigan
v.
jackson
because
he
silently
acquiesced
in
the
appointment
of
counsel
at
his
initial
hearing,
rather
than
affirmatively
accepting
the
appointment.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
believed
that
an
affirmative
acceptance
was
required
to
trigger
jackson
and
therefore
upheld
the
admission
of
a
confession
elicited
during
police-initiated
interrogation
after
montejo's
sixth
amendment
right
had
attached
and
after
a
lawyer
had
been
appointed
to
represent
him.
if
jackson
applies,
that
confession
should
not
have
been
admitted,
and
jackson
should
apply
because
nothing
in
this
court's
precedents
or,
frankly,
in
common
sense
supports
a
rule
that
affords
less
sixth
amendment
protection
to
defendants
who
are
automatically
appointed
counsel
at
initial
hearings
than
to
defendants
who
are
appointed
counsel
after
a
request
for
counsel
has--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
--
without
taking
up
at
the
moment
the
question
whether
jackson
was
extravagant,
it
does
seem
to
me,
your
honor,
that
your
question
does
get
to
the
heart
of
the
matter.
in
a
situation
like
jackson,
the
defendant
requested
counsel
and
that
was
deemed
to
be
an
election
of
the
right
to
rely
on
counsel,
not
merely
at
the
initial
hearing
but
for
all
purposes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
the
question
here,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
is
what
does
one
do
when
a
defendant
is
automatically
appointed
counsel?
there
are
two
options:
one
is
to
treat
that
defendant
as
having
elected
the
right
to
rely
on
counsel,
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
the
other
option
is
to
deem
that
the
defendant
has
decided
to
go
it
alone.
those
are
the
two
possibilities
here,
and
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
the
problem,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
in
the
--
it
is
an
either/or
choice
because,
if
you
--
if
the
defendant
is
deemed
to
have
elected
to
rely
on
counsel
on
the
basis
of
the
appointment,
then
the
police
may
not
initiate
interrogation.
it's
only
if
the
defendant--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
if
the
police
initiate
interrogation
after
a
lawyer
has
been
automatically
appointed,
then
that
interrogation
either
has
to
be
deemed
to
be
in
violation
of
the
rule
of
jackson
or
not,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
depend
on
how
you
characterize
what
happens
in
the
course
of
an
automatic
appointment.
if
you--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
absolutely
the
critical
point,
justice
ginsburg.
this
is
a
limited
rule,
and
the
free
choice
of
the
defendant
to
initiate
a
conversation
with
the
authorities
is
always
present.
the
question
is,
what
do
we
do
in
an
automatic
appointment
situation?
and
this
is
a
significant
question
because
--
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
appendix,
to
the
amicus
brief
of
the
national
legal
aid
and
defender
association,
which
i
think
is
a
helpful
reference
here.
it
goes
through
each
state,
and
what
it
shows
is
that
approximately
half
the
states
have
procedures
in
which,
as
a
matter
of
course,
the
defendant
is
asked
at
the
hearing
whether
he
or
she
wants
counsel,
and
if
the
defendant
says
yes,
then
we're
in
a
jackson
situation.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
if
he
initiates.
initiation
is
the
key.
initiation--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy.
a
couple
things.
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
me
that
to
reach
that
conclusion
that
the
court
really
would
have
to
overrule
what
is
a
key
holding
in
jackson,
and
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
appropriate
to
do
in
this
case
for
a
whole
host
of
reasons.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
it
depends
on
initiation.
it
depends
on
who
initiates.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
if
the
defendant--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
if
the
--
if
the
defendant
initiates,
then
the
defendant
is
--
then
the
bar
of
jackson
doesn't
apply.
that's
the
rule,
but
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
--
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
you
can
reach
that
result
without
overruling
the
core
holding
of
jackson
here,
it
does
seem
to
me,
with
all
due
respect,
we
don't
agree
with
that
because,
on
the
one
hand,
we
do
think
that
free
choice
is
preserved
in
the
existing
regime
and,
on
the
other,
hand
we
don't
think
miranda
can
give
you
all
the
protection
you
need.
and
i
think
a
good
illustration
of
that
is
this
court's
decision
in
the
moran
case.
now,
recall
in
moran,
that
was
an
interrogation
that
occurred
before
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment
rights
had
attached,
and
the
--
and
the
police
--
and
the
defendant
had
a
lawyer
in
that
case.
his
sister
had
hired
a
lawyer
for
him.
the
lawyer
was
trying
to
reach
him.
the
police
kept
him
away,
kept
the
lawyer
away
from
the
defendant.
the
court
held
that,
in
the
fifth
amendment
context,
because
the
sixth
amendment
right
had
not
attached,
that
the
miranda
warnings
sufficed
to
guarantee
the
reliability
of
the
confession.
but
the
court
was
very
quick
to
point
out,
and
then
reiterated
this
again
in
patterson,
that
in
the
sixth
amendment
context
that
would
be
a
violation
because
it's
an
interference
with
the
relationship
between
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer,
and
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
rely
on
the
lawyer.
and
that's
the
key.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
what
the
--
we're
applying
--
the
question
here
is
whether
defendants
in
this
category,
the
category
that
mr.
montejo
is
in,
automatic
appointment,
are
entitled
to
the
same
sixth
amendment
protection
as
defendants
who
are
in
the
category
of
--
who
are
brought
to
trial
in
states
where
they
--
you
have
this
colloquy
as
part
of
the
initial
hearing
where
the
defendant
is
asked.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
two
things,
your
honor.
first,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
dispute
here
is
is
whether
there
is
a
principled
basis
for
treating
these
two
categories
of
defendants
differently,
the
defendants
who
are
brought
to
hearings
in
states
where
the
procedures
require
that
they
be
asked
and
defendants
who
are
brought
to
hearing
in
states
where
they
are
automatically
appointed
counsel
without
a
showing
of
indigency
--
upon
a
showing
of
indigency.
and
i
don't
--
i
think
with
respect
to
the
question
of
practical
problems
going
forward,
sure,
if
all
states
--
if
the
states
in
that
second
category
were
to
conform
their
practices
such
that
the
defendants
were
asked
and
had
the
opportunity
to
say
yes,
indeed,
i
want
counsel,
then
i
suppose
the
problem
would
be
solved.
but
you
really
get
to
the
same
place
by
holding,
as
we
submit
the
court
really
should
hold,
that
when
--
when
you
have
an
automatic
appointment,
unless
there
is
some
reason
to
think
the
defendant
is
rejecting
it,
that
jackson
kicks
in
and
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--sure.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
the
rule
of
michigan
against
jackson
applies,
and
that's
because--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
from
cases
applying
it,
because
in
that
situation
the
person
is
deemed
to
assert
the
right
to
counsel
by
hiring
a
lawyer,
just
as
by
asking,
and
the
question
here
is
when
you
have
an
automatic
appointment
why
should
you
treat
that
category
of
defendants
any
differently
for
purposes
of
applying
the
jackson
rule?
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
that's
the
whole
problem
here,
justice
ginsburg.
all
we
have
is
a
one-page
minute
order
which
reflects
that
counsel
was
appointed.
it
doesn't
reflect
anything
about
a
colloquy
because
in
the
normal
course
there's
not
--
there's
no
occasion
for
the
colloquy.
you
come
in,
you
get
your
lawyer,
a
decision
about
bail
is
made,
and
you
move
on,
and
the
next
person
comes
in
and
that
happens.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
office
of
indigent
counsel
is
appointed
to
represent
you.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
right.
the
way
the
process
works
is
--
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
the
way
the
process
works
in
this
judicial
district
is
there
is
a
legal
assistant
there
who
takes
the
names
of
people
who
need
lawyers
and
then
immediately
--
and
the
public
defender
service
in
this
district
is
a
contract
service.
they're
private
attorneys
who
contract
out
to
do
it.
and
then
the
legal
assistant
immediately
calls,
tells
the
lawyers,
well,
here
is
who
you
are
representing.
now,
in
a
case
like
this
one,
which
is
a
capital
case,
there
was
of
course
a
great
sense
of
urgency.
there
are
only
two
lawyers
in
this
district
who
are
qualified
to
represent
capital
defendants.
they
got
called
immediately.
recall
what
happened
here
was
that
this
hearing
took
place
in
the
morning
and
mr.
montejo
gets
taken
back
to
the
jail
and
very
soon
after
he
arrives
he
gets
checked
back
out
by
these
officers
again
and
taken
out
in
the
squad
car
where
he
is
kept
for
six
hours,
and
in
the
meantime
essentially
while
he's
going
out
the
back
door,
while
he's
being
taken
out
the
back
door
with
the
police,
his
lawyer
is
coming
in
the
front
door
and
raising
holy
heck
about
the
fact
that
his
client's
not--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--if
the
police
initiated
the
interrogation,
yes,
because
i
think
it
gets
to
the
heart
of
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
defendant
initiated
the
conversation--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--if
the
police
initiated
the
interrogation,
it's
a
violation.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
i
think
that
in
that
situation
the
defendant
has
initiated
and
then
you've
got
the
kind
of
free
choice
that
the
law
respects,
and
that's
where
the
line
is
drawn
here.
but
that
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it's
at
the
outset.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
at
the
outset,
it
seems
to
me.
he
has
initiated.
he
exercises
free
choice.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
it
isn't
what
happened
here
at
all.
in
fact,
it
seems
to
me
the
opposite,
the
opposite
thing
happened
here.
for
one
thing,
as
a
factual
matter
he
was
told
by
the
police
on
september
10th
that
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer,
despite
the
fact
that
one
had
been
appointed
for
him
in
the
morning.
that
was
his
testimony.
now,
i
recognize
that
there
is
a
factual
issue
here
that
is
not
resolved,
but
the
louisiana
supreme
court
did
not
discredit
that
testimony.
it
acknowledged
it.
what
it
said
was
--
and
i
think
this
points
up,
justice
kennedy,
what
the
problem
is
with
relying
solely
on
miranda
--
that
even
in
that
situation,
even
if
it's
true
that
the
police
officers
told
him
on
september
10th
that
he
did
not
have
a
lawyer,
that
that
wouldn't
rise
to
the
level
of
a
problem
that
would
cause
a
fifth
amendment
issue
under
miranda
because
of
the
facts
of
moran.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
exactly
the
problem
there,
that
that
means
in
fact,
if
we
apply
moran
that
way,
that
the
police
could
deliberately
tell
him
incorrectly
that
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
when
he
did.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
well,
moran
says
no.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
moran
says
that
a
miranda
waiver
is
valid
despite
that
kind
of
deception.
that's
the
problem
here,
it
seems
to
me.
it
does
get
to
the
difference.
in
the
fifth
amendment
context,
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer
there
is
a
prophylactic
protection
against
a
coerced
self-incrimination
in
the
setting
of
custodial
interrogation.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
would
be
hard,
given
moran,
to
say
that
there
was.
and
that
points
up
the
problem.
the
essence
of
this
right
is
the
right
to
rely
on
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
critical
stages
and
interrogation
is
a
critical
stage.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
a
bit
complicated,
justice
stevens.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
here's
my
best
way
to
work
through
the
facts.
detective
hall,
the
only
officer
who
testified,
testified
that
he
was
not
aware.
the
state
court
credited
that
and
we
don't
take
issue
with
it.
the
problem
is
that
this
is
a
police
precinct
that
has,
i
don't
know,
maybe
10,
12
officers
in
it.
they
have
a
capital
murder
suspect
in
there.
he
was
taken
by
the
police
to
the
hearing.
the
police
were
present
at
the
hearing
that
morning.
he
was
taken
back--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
--
i
think
under
jackson,
justice
stevens,
they
are
charged
with
the
knowledge.
and
i
think
it's
important
that
they
have
to
be
charged
with
the
knowledge,
because
otherwise
there
is
all
kinds
of
room
for
manipulation
and
deception.
and
i
do
think
that's
a
big
part
of
the
problem
here,
that
--
and
i
also
think
it's
important
to
point
out
as
a
factual
matter
the
one
detective
who
did
testify,
detective
hall,
testified
very
carefully.
he
testified
that
he
asked
the
defendant
when
he
went
to
see
him
whether
he
had
been
contacted
by
counsel
or
whether
his
family
had
gotten
him
a
lawyer,
and
of
course
neither
of
those
things
was
true.
he
was
indigent,
his
family
hadn't
gotten
him
a
lawyer,
and
he
hadn't
yet
been
contacted
by
counsel.
he
didn't
ask
him:
did
you
have
a
lawyer
appointed
for
you?
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
it
ought
not
be
reexamined
here,
justice
alito,
for
several
reasons.
one,
the
respondent
has
not
asked
for
it.
two,
there's
a
special
justification
that
has
to
be
shown
to
overrule
it,
as
dickerson
says,
in
the
miranda
context,
and
this
is
quite
parallel.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
it's
quite
important
that
the
court
do
so,
and
there
was
a
strong
consensus
in
dickerson
that
the
court
do
so.
i
think
there's
a
real
problem.
this
is
not
something
that
should
be
done
lightly
based
on
four
pages
of
discussion
in
one
amicus
brief.
there's
a
very
sharp
dividing
line
in
the
law
between
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
sixth
amendment
here,
and
it
applies
in
numerous
areas.
it's
true,
for
example,
with
respect
to
lineups.
you
can
have
an
uncounseled
lineup
before
the
sixth
amendment
right
attaches,
you
can't
after.
you
can
have
an
uncounseled
psychiatric
examination
before
it
attaches,
you
can't
after.
you
can
engage
in
surreptitious
interrogation
of
a
suspect
before
the
fifth
amendment
--
before
the
sixth
amendment
right
attaches;
you
can't
after.
certain
kinds
of
arraignments
have
to
be
done
in
the
presence
of
counsel.
so
it
seems
to
me
you
would
be
destabilizing
a
whole
significant
area
of
law
without
very
much
consideration
here
were
you
to
say
that
in
this
context
we're
going
to
just
say
that
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
sixth
amendment
operate
in
an
equivalent
manner.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
you
would
be
overruling
jackson
in
that
regard.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
in
a
case
in
which
it
seems
to
me
manifestly
not
appropriate
to
do
so,
given
the
lack
of
consideration
given
to
this
by
the
respondent--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
--
well,
this
is
serious
business.
you
are
going
to
overrule
a
precedent
that's
been
in
place
for
more
than
20
years,
that
provides
a
very
clear
bright-line
rule
for
the
police
to
--
to
manage
their
affairs
with
not
the
slightest
showing
that
this
rule
is
presenting
any
practical
problems
in
its
administration
out
there
in
the
field.
nobody
has
even
argued
that.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
souter.
the
text
of
the
sixth
amendment
provides
that
the
--
the
accused
shall
have
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
the
essence
of
the
right
is
the
right
to
rely
on
the
lawyer
at
critical
stages
of
the
proceeding.
and
what
jackson
says
is
that
that
right
deserves
a
very
significant
measure
of
protection,
and
we
are
going
to
assume
that
once
a
defendant
asserts
it,
the
defendant
wants
the
--
wants
the
assistance
of
counsel
through
every
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
make
it
quite
clear
that
it's
a
very
serious
risk.
here
you
have
a
situation
in
which
a
defendant
who,
after
all,
even
before
his
right
attached
has
been
subjected
to
very,
very
aggressive
tactics
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court
recognized
presented
even
a
close
case
even
--
even
under
the
fifth
amendment.
then
he
--
he
finally
has
a
72-hour
hearing.
he
gets
a
lawyer
appointed.
as
soon
as
he
gets
back,
they
take
him
out
in
a
squad
car
for
six
or
seven
hours,
at
the
end
of
which
he
produces
a
--
an
apology-letter
confession
written
on
a
pad
with
a
pen
given
to
him
by
the
police
officers
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
you
have
--
what
you
have
is
a
right
to
rely
on
the
assistance
of
your
lawyer,
and
you
have
--
and
--
and
it's
critical.
a
good
example
of
why
it's
critical--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
jackson
drew
a
clear
line.
it
did
so
because
--
and
the
court
has
said
--
it
was
a
--
a
prophylactic
rule,
but
it's
a
prophylactic
rule
that
represents
--
reflects
the
centrality
of
--
of
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--criminal
process.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
two
--
two
points
on
that,
mr.
chief
justice:
first,
i
think
it
would
actually
break
new
ground
for
this
court
to
hold
that
the
defendant
who
has
a
lawyer
isn't
entitled
to
the
protection
of
jackson.
this
court
has
never
held
that.
and
every
time
it
has
addressed
the
issue,
it
said
the
opposite.
admittedly
in
dictum,
but
in
patterson
and
moran
it
said
the
opposite.
so
that
is
what
is
really
breaking
new
ground,
it
seems
to
me.
and
second,
the
only
way
to
treat
these
two
categories
of
people
differently
is
to
come
up
with
a
principled
distinction
for
why
the
right
should
apply
differently
to
one
than
the
other,
and
i
submit
that
none
has
been
offered.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
couple
points
of
clarification,
if
i
might:
counsel
for
respondent
has
made
the
suggestion
that
the
only
facts
that
are
before
you
are
the
facts
that
were
in
the
suppression
hearing,
rather
than
the
facts
that
were
subsequently
adduced
at
trial
when
mr.
montejo
testified
that
he
told
them
he
didn't
want
to
go
with
them
and
he
thought
he
had
a
lawyer
and
was
told
he
didn't.
that's
not
correct
as
a
matter
of
louisiana
law.
the
citation
there
is
state
v.
green,
655
southern
2d
272,
where
it's
quite
clear
as
a
matter
of
louisiana
law
that
the
supreme
court
evaluates
the
entire
record.
it's
not
clear
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
that
was
one
of
the
holdings
of
arizona
against
fulminante.
now,
we
cited
that
case
for
harmless
error
purposes,
not
this
purpose,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
quite
clear--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes.
we
don't
contest
that,
justice
ginsburg.
of
course,
it
wasn't
used
for
impeachment
purposes;
it
was
used
in
fact
as
substantive
evidence,
and
there
was
no
limiting
instruction
to
let
the
jury
know
that
it
could
only
be
considered
for
that
limited
purpose.
and
i
don't
think
that
suffices
even
remotely
to
overcome
the
harmless
error
problem
here.
the
second
point
of
clarification,
it
does
seem
to
me
clear,
both
from
pages
14
and
15
of
respondent's
brief
and
respondent's
argument
here
today
and
in
particular
the
citation
to
the
montoya
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
they
are
not
advocating
a
request
rule;
they
are
advocating
a
request
or
assertion
rule.
in
fact,
the
very
passage
in
montoya
to
which
respondent's
counsel
adverts
--
it
says
there
doesn't
have
to
be
a
request
so
long
as
there
is
an
assertion.
and
that's
the
principle
they're
advocating.
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
as
a
sensible
dividing
line
between
categories
of
defendants
who
are
protected
by
jackson
and
those
who
aren't
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
discussed.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
it
would
come--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
if
it's
introduced
in
the
case
in
chief,
it's
substantive
evidence
on
which
the
prosecution
relied
or
can
rely
to
establish
the
case.
it's
very
much
like
fulminante
in
that
regard.
there
were
two
confessions,
one
admissible,
the
other
inadmissible.
and
it
was
the
self-reinforcing
character
of
the
two
that
made
it
not
a
harmless
error
for
fulminante.
we
really
have
the
same
thing
here.
but,
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
get
back,
justice
kennedy,
to
the
moran
case.
i
do
think,
with
all
due
respect,
there
was
an
element
of
deception
in
moran
that
was
sanctioned
as
consistent
with
miranda.
two
things
happened
there:
the
police
informed
moran's
lawyer
that
they
--
incorrectly,
falsely
--
that
they
weren't
going
to
interrogate
him,
but
they
also
failed
to
inform
moran
that
he
had
a
lawyer,
and
the
lawyer
was
standing
out
there.
and
that's
fully
as
much
of
a
deception
as
telling
somebody
he
doesn't
have
a
lawyer
when
he
does,
or
withholding
information
that
made
a
big
difference
for
sixth
amendment
purposes,
which
is
why
the
court
in
moran
drew
that
line
very
sharply
and
said,
for
fifth
amendment
purposes,
the
sixth
amendment
right
hasn't
attached,
there
isn't
an
interference
with
the
attorney-client
relationship,
but
the
very
same
thing
would
be
forbidden
under
the
sixth
amendment.
and
patterson
says
exactly
the
same
thing.
in
patterson,
again
--
just
to
conclude,
justice
breyer
--
drew
the
line
exactly
where
your
honor's
hypothetical
drew
it.
what
patterson
says
is
that,
if
a
defendant
does
not
have
a
lawyer,
we
operate
one
way;
when
a
defendant
has
a
lawyer,
a
different
set
of
rules
kick
in.
and
then,
it
says,
indeed
the
different
rules
kick
in
even
if
a
defendant
requests
a
lawyer,
making
clear
that
the
point
of
extending
to
request
was
to
put
defendants
who
have
asked
for
lawyers
but
don't
have
them
yet
in
the
same
position
as
defendants
who
have
lawyers,
not
to
give
them
a
superior
sixth
amendment
protection.
thank
you.
