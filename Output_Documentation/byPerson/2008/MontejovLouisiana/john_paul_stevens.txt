justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
verrilli,
is
it
part
of
your
assumption
that
at
the
time
the
police
were
doing
the
interrogating
that
they
knew
he
had
been
appointed
a
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
why
i'm
interested
in
your
comment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
presume
--
do
you
argue
that
we
should
presume
that
the
entire
police
force
is
aware
of
what
happened
in
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt.
isn't
it
perfectly
realistic
to
presume
that
the
police
knew
at
the
72-hour
hearing
he
was
appointed
a
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
happens
in
99
percent
of
the
cases,
i
think,
in
a
capital
case.
and
surely,
the
police
should
be
presumed
to
know
what
the
normal
procedure
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
this
very
case,
if
there
had
been
a
court
reporter
present
--
present,
and
if
the
record
showed
that
this
defendant
said,
thank
you,
i
would
like
to
be
represented,
then
he
would
have
been
protected,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
louisiana
does
not
--
does
not
provide
a
transcript
of
all
these
hearings,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
would
--
what
should
we
presume
to
be
the
general
practice
that
happened,
that
most
of
them
say,
no,
i
don't
want
one
or
most
of
them
will
say,
thank
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
had
no
--
no
way
of
knowing
that
being
silent
would
produce
a
different
result
than
saying,
yes,
i'm
happy
with
the
lawyer.
does
the
uncounseled
defendant
have
any
way
to
know
that?
does
the
routine
require
the
judge
to
tell
him,
you
have
got
a
lawyer,
but
he's
not
going
to
be
available
unless
you
say
you
want
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understood
you
to
concede
that
if
he
had
made
that
request
at
the
72-hour
hearing,
the
outcome
of
this
case
would
be
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
key
time
is
did
he
make
the
request
at
the
hearing,
not
at
the
time
he
was
confronted
by
the
officers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
sufficient
protection
for
him
if
you
presume,
as
is
true
in
most
states,
that
he
did
make
the
request,
then
you
would
lose.
you
would
argue
against
such
a
presumption,
i
know,
but
if
we
did
indulge
that
presumption,
the
case
would
be
over.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you:
if
the
case
had
gone
to
trial
without
any
intermediate
proceeding
--
they
just
show
up
for
the
day
of
trial
--
and
there's
no
record
of
whether
he
accepted
the
lawyer
earlier,
would
the
state
judge
start
out
with
the
presumption
that
faretta
would
apply
and
he's
going
on
his
own,
or
would
they
start
out
with
the
assumption
that
he
is
going
to
have
a
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
drawing
a
distinction
between
this
--
the
kind
of
proceeding
that's
involved?
he
doesn't
really
need
help
on
deciding
whether
to
confess,
but
he
does
need
help
if
they
go
to
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
an
irony
in
this
case
that
justice
kennedy
put
a
finger
on
earlier:
if
there
were
a
civil
case,
whether
you
could
go
talk
to
a
lawyer
--
a
client,
rather,
who
was
represented
by
a
lawyer,
the
answer
would
be
quite
clear:
you
could
not,
as
a
matter
of
professional
ethics.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
constitution
gives
less
protection
than
the
--
than
the
professional
ethics
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
that
justice
souter
and
justice
ginsburg
have
joined.
justice
breyer
has
joined
all
of
that
opinion
except
one
footnote
and
he
has
also
found
a
short
dissenting
statement.
the
sixth
amendment
provides
that
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
for
his
defense.
in
a
long
line
of
cases,
the
court
has
held
that
such
assistance
must
be
available
at
every
critical
stage
of
the
prosecution
including
those
that
occur
outside
the
courtroom.
post-indictment,
police-initiated
interrogation
whether
or
not
it
amounts
to
badgering
is
one
such
critical
stage.
until
today,
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
if
a
defendant
was
represented
by
a
lawyer,
the
police
could
not
question
him
without
giving
notice
to
his
lawyer
and
unless
the
lawyer
was
present
and
unless
the
defendant
initiated
the
encounter.
that
result
was
clear
not
only
from
our
decision
in
michigan
against
jackson
but
also
from
the
reasoning
of
earlier
cases
such
as
united
states
against
wade.
as
i
explained
at
length
in
my
dissenting
opinion,
the
court's
decision
to
overrule
jackson
is
both
unwise
and
unjustified.
it
will
however
have
only
limited
practical
consequences
because
ethics
rules
governing
the
conduct
of
prosecutors
in
every
state
and
in
the
federal
government
already
prohibit
them
from
directing
their
agents
to
interrogate
represented
defendants
outside
the
presence
of
counsel.
the
court's
decision
to
overrule
jackson
will
therefore
not
affect
the
way
most
law
enforcement
agencies
which
mostly
of
course
are
thoroughly
ethical,
govern
their
--
in
directions
with
represented
defendants.
it
is
only
the
rare
unethical
prosecutor
whose
conduct
is
endorsed
by
the
court
today.
but
that
fact
highlights
the
lack
of
justification
for
departing
from
the
rule
of
stare
decisis
and
diminishing
the
value
of
an
important
constitutional
right.
the
decision
to
overrule
jackson
is
unsound
and
unwise.
it
can
only
have
an
adverse
impact
on
the
law
enforcement
profession
in
the
rule
of
law
itself.
