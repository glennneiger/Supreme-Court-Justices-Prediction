justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
verrilli,
do
you
think
that
michigan
v.
jackson
is
immune
from
being
reexamined
at
this
point?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
we
were
no
longer
to
adhere
to
that
rule
on
issues
of
constitutional
criminal
procedure?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
isn't
the
prophylactic
aspect
of
jackson
not
what
justice
breyer
just
said,
but
the
rule
that
a
person
who
has
a
lawyer
is
thereafter
incapable
of
waiving
the
assistance
of
the
lawyer
if
the
person
wishes
to
speak
with
the
police
and
the
police
happen
to
initiate
the
conversation?
you
could
have
a
defendant
who's
the
most
experienced
criminal
defense
attorney
in
the
world,
who
knows
everything
there
is
to
know
about
trial
tactics,
who
has
a
lawyer
and
decides
it's
in
my
best
interest
now
to
speak
to
the
police.
they
happen
to
initiate
it.
but
jackson
has
a
prophylactic
rule
that
says
even
in
that
situation,
it
can't
be
done.
that's
the
prophylactic
aspect
of
jackson,
isn't
it?
