justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
verrilli,
you
have
spoken
of
--
of
overruling
a
bright
line,
but
i
think
there
is
something
else
that
would
be
involved
in
the
overruling.
and
i
--
i
haven't
pulled
jackson
back
out
since
i
came
on
the
bench,
so
this
is
where
you've
got
to
help
me
out.
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
difference
between
the
way
you
are
phrasing
the
sixth
amendment
right
and
the
way,
for
example,
justice
scalia
has
phrased
it
in
his
question.
justice
scalia
has
phrased
it
in
terms
of
determining
what
is
a
coerced
confession.
you
have
phrased
it
in
your
argument
in
terms
of
saying
a
right
to
rely
upon
counsel,
which
is
a
much
broader
concept.
does
jackson
support
the
notion
that
he
simply
has
a
right
to
rely
upon
counsel?
i
think
that
is
your
principal
argument
here
because
that
would
be
the
argument
that
supports
your
claim
that
there
shouldn't
be
a
distinction
between
a
case
in
which
the
state
simply
appoints
counsel
without
being
asked
and
a
case
in
which
he
actually
asks
for
counsel.
that
would
be
a
nice
way
of
rationalizing
that
distinction.
isn't
it
the
case
that
you
understand
jackson
to
be
a
broader
rule
than
a
merely
no-coercion
rule?
and,
number
two,
if
that
is
so,
then
overruling
jackson
would,
as
i
take
it,
in
your
view
be
more
than
simply
substituting
a
--
a
one
bright-line
coercion
rule
for
a
different
bright-line
coercion
rule.
so
what
are
your
responses
to
those
two
questions?
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me.
they
advised
him,
you
say,
of
his
right
to
counsel.
if
they
gave
him
the
standard
miranda
warning,
what
they
said
was:
you
have
the
right
to
have
a
counsel
appointed.
they
didn't
say:
you
have
a
lawyer
who
has
been
appointed.
and,
in
fact,
his
testimony
at
least
is
that
they
told
him
the
opposite.
but
if
all
they
did
was
give
him
the
miranda
warning,
they
certainly
were
not
informing
him
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
or
his
sixth
amendment
status.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
doesn't
go
to
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
is
not
that
he
lost
because
he
failed
to
make
a
request.
he
lost
because
he
failed
to
make
it
affirmatively
clear
that
he
accepted
the
appointment
of
the
lawyer
who
had,
in
fact,
been
appointed
for
him
as
he
had
been
told.
that's
not
a
request.
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
--
under
the
state
court
ruling,
if
he
had
stood
at
the
72-hour
hearing
and
the
court
had
said,
we're
appointing
the
x
office
to
defend
you,
and
he
had
said,
great,
that
would
have
changed
the
result
in
this
case;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
issue
is
not
request.
the
issue
is
acceptance.
that's
what
it
seems
--
just
to
get
my
point,
that's
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
acute
point
of
several
of
the
questions
you
have
been
asked.
why
--
we're
not
talking
about
requests.
why
should
it
make
a
constitutional
difference
whether
the
man
stands
in
a
tennessee
courtroom
and
simply
stands
silent
when
they
said,
you've
got
a
lawyer--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
distinct
from
a
case
where
they
say
you
have
got
a
lawyer,
and
he
says,
that's
fine?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
not
merely
defending
the
state
court
here.
you're
asking
for
a
--
in
effect,
a
different
rule
from
that
which
the
state
court
applied.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
are
you
equating
positive
affirmation
with
request
for
a
lawyer?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
on
your
--
then
on
your
theory,
this
individual's
sixth
amendment
right
would
not
have
attached
if
he
had
stood
in
the
courtroom
and
said,
thank
you
very
much,
that's
great.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
also
arguing,
it
seems
to
me,
that
a
request
--
well,
you're
--
i
think
you're
arguing
two
different
things.
on
the
one
hand,
you're
arguing
that
a
request
is
necessary,
and
yet
on
the
other
hand,
i
understood
you
to
concede
in
answer
to
a
question
from
me
that
if
he
had
stood
in
the
courtroom
in
tennessee,
having
been
told
that
counsel
was
appointed
for
him
and
had
said,
yes,
thank
you,
i
accept
that
lawyer,
that
that
would
have
been
sufficient
to
satisfy
jackson,
and
that
would
have
made
the
difference
in
this
case.
those
are
two
different
positions.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
so
far
as
i
understand
it,
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
as
i
understand
it,
what
the
state
supreme
court
said
was
not
that
he
had
to
make
a
request,
"i
want
a
lawyer",
but
simply
that
he
had
to
indicate
in
some
way
that
he
accepted
the
appointment
of
the
lawyer
which
he
had
been
told
had
been
appointed
for
him;
and
that
is
a
different
situation
from
jackson.
so
if
--
if
you
are
saying,
yes,
if
he
had
said
"thank
you,
i
accept
the
lawyer.
"
that
would
have
been
enough,
then
that
in
effect
is
--
is
maintaining
the
position
that
the
state
court
took;
but
if
you're
saying
something
more,
that
he
had
to
say
then
or
later
on,
"i
want
a
lawyer",
then
i
think
you're
going
beyond
the
case
that
we
have
in
front
of
us.
am
i
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
