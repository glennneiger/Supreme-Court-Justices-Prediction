i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
assume
a
lawyer
is
appointed.
the
defendant
says,
"yes,
i
want
my
lawyer.
"
he's
in
the
jail
cell.
the
policeman
walks
by,
he
says,
"i
have
a
lawyer,
but
i
want
to
talk
to
you
now.
"
can
the
police
talk
to
him?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
well,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
miranda
protections
give
you
all
--
or,
the
miranda
rules
give
you
all
the
protection
you
need.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
wondering
if
there
is
some
further
rule,
could
the
prosecutor
talk
to
the
defendant
if
the
defendant
was
in
the
cell
and
the
prosecutor
walked
by,
saying,
"i
know
you
have
an
attorney,
but
i
would
like
to
talk
to
you?
"
could
the
prosecutor
do
that
consistently
with
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
really?
the
lawyer--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
lawyer
can
talk
to
a
client
for
another
lawyer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
again,
if
that's
--
if
that's
the
principle
that
you're
operating
on
and
that
you'd
concede,
then
i
think
the
miranda
warnings
would
suffice
to
give
all
the
protection
you
need.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
wouldn't
that
be
a
miranda
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
miranda.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think,
given
moran,
that
there
was
no
miranda
violation
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
they
know
--
it's
a
death
case
--
that
counsel
is
going
to
be
appoint
--
or
it's
a
murder
case
--
that
counsel
is
going
to
be
appointed.
everybody
knows
that
except
this
defendant.
he
doesn't
know;
of
course
he
doesn't
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
of
my
concerns
is
that
jackson
is
a
formality,
but
you're
arguing
for
a
formality
on
top
of
a
formality.
i
don't
know
what
functional
purpose
is
served
by
your
position
that
he
has
to
request
the
lawyer
at
the
arraignment,
especially
when
he's
not
versed
in
the
law,
he's
in
this
stressful
situation,
and
you
require
a
formalistic
request
on
the
part
of
the
defendant?
it
just
makes
no
sense
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
you're
requiring
some
kind
of
ritualistic
phrase
to
indicate
that
he
--
that
he
accepts
the
appointment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
he
requests
the
appointment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this
is
still
an
artificial
framework,
because
we
know
that
in
this
case
he
has
to
have
a
lawyer
under
gideon
unless
he
waives
it
after
being
fully
advised.
you
couldn't
rely
just
on
--
on
the
failure
to
make
a
request
not
to
proceed
with
a
trial
without
a
lawyer.
of
course
he's
going
to
have
a
lawyer
unless
after
he
very,
very
careful
colloquy
from
the
district
judge
or
the
trial
judge,
declines.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
this
--
this
whole
framework
here
is
quite
artificial.
now,
i
do
think
there's
a
miranda
problem
here,
if
we
accept
his
--
the
defendant's
testimony
that
the
police
told
him,
"oh
no,
you
don't
have
a
lawyer.
"
i
know
there's
a
factual
issue
on
that.
and
i
--
i
think
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
may
not
be
quite
correct
in
moran
v
burbine.
i
didn't
have
time
to
talk
with
him
about
that.
there
there
was
no
misleading;
they
just
didn't
tell
him
that
he
had
a
lawyer.
here,
assuming
his
version
of
the
facts
is
correct,
they
told
him,
"oh,
no,
you
don't
have
a
lawyer.
"
they
affirmatively
misled
him,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
miranda
problem,
if
it's
true,
and
that
miranda
is
completely
sufficient
to
protect
his
rights.
