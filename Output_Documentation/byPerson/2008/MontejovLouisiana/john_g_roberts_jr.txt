chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
07-1529,
montejo
v.
louisiana.
mr.
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt,
but
isn't
there
a
third,
which
is
that
you
just
don't
assume
anything
and
you
wait
to
see
if
he
makes
--
says,
"i
want
to
talk
to
my
lawyer.
"
or
he
could
well
say,
"you've
told
me",
as
was
the
case
here,
"i
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer,
i
don't
have
to
say
anything,
i
want
to
talk
some
more,
i
don't
--
okay,
there's
a
lawyer,
fine,
i
want
to
talk
without
my
lawyer,
i
want
to
waive
my
right
to
counsel.
"
which
he
can
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
if
you
prevail
and
you
say
silence
constitutes
saying
"i
want
to
talk
to
my
lawyer.
"
that's
right.
i'm
saying
that's
a
false,
a
false
alternative.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
rule
you're
asking
for
would
apply
across
the
board.
how
would
it
apply
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
is
given
miranda
warnings,
says,
thank
you,
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
my
lawyer,
i
want
to
talk
to
you.
he's
talking
to
the
police.
all
of
a
sudden
they
bring
a
note
in
and
say:
they've
appointed
a
lawyer.
the
police
says:
i
just
got
a
note;
you've
been
appointed
a
lawyer.
do
you
want
to
keep
talking?
you
would
say
that's
a
violation,
right?
and
then
he
says
yes
and
continues
to
talk.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
violation,
even
though
he
knows
that
if
he
wanted
a
lawyer
he
could
request
one,
he
knows
one's
been
appointed
for
him,
and
he's
been
warned
that
if
he
doesn't
want
to
talk
without
a
lawyer
he
doesn't
have
to,
and
he's
in
the
middle
of
a
conversation
that
he
initiated,
and
the
police
says,
do
you
want
to
keep
talking?
that's
a
violation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
early
on,
before
the
lawyer
was
appointed,
he's
given
miranda
warnings
and
he
says:
i
want
to
talk.
he's
talking.
they
say:
now,
we
just
got
the
word;
a
lawyer
has
been
appointed;
do
you
want
to
keep
talking?
he
says
yes.
that's
a
violation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
trying
to
--
which
stage
are
you
talking
about,
before
the
lawyer
was
appointed
or
after?
i'm
telling
you
before
he
was
appointed,
the
police
did
not
initiate
the
conversation.
they
told
him
he
didn't
have
to
talk.
he
says:
i
want
to
talk.
now,
you're
saying
it
counts
as
initiating
the
interrogation
if
they
say:
you've
got
a
lawyer;
do
you
want
to
keep
talking?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
he
--
where
is
the
initiation?
is
it
when
he
says,
yes,
i
want
to
keep
talking,
after
being
told
--
asked
do
you
want
to
keep
talking?
or
is
it
way
back
at
the
beginning?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
at
the
outset.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
what
happened
here?
he
had
been
given
his
miranda
warnings,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
again,
you
are
arguing
the
facts
of
a
particular
case,
and
we
are
looking
at
a
rule
that
is
going
to
apply
across
the
board.
in
a
particular
case,
as
you
say,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
said
this
almost
violated
his
fifth
amendment
right.
there
are
protections
against
the
actual
coercion,
which
it
seems
to
me
you're
arguing.
as
i
understood
justice
scalia's
question,
he
says:
don't
you
have
to
assume
that
there
is
coercion
even
in
the
mildest
case,
not
the
most
extreme
one,
but
the
mildest
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
right
that
you
can
relinquish,
a
right
that
you
can
waive,
and
all
that's
being
suggested
is
that
it
is
not
totally
determinative
whether
the
police
say:
do
you
want
to
keep
talking,
or
if
the
defendant
says:
i
want
to
keep
talking.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
and
whether
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--whether
or
not
your
--
your
dialogue
with
my
colleagues
about
overruling
jackson
--
putting
that
to
one
side,
what
you
are
arguing
is
an
extension
of
jackson
from
the
context
in
which
it
arose
to
this
context.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
landry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
i
didn't
understand
you
to
be
doing
that.
i
thought
your
position
was
once
there's
a
request,
there's
a
request,
and
that's
enough.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
--
i
suppose
what
the
dialogue
simply
establishes
is
that
like
in
any
situation
there's
going
to
be
factual
issues
about
what's
a
request
or
not.
i
mean,
he
could
say,
the
court
says
i'm
appointing
johnson,
and
he
says,
"johnson?
"
"is
that
the
best
you
can
do?
"
and
the
question
is,
is
that
accepting
johnson
or
not?
he
says
is
that
the
best
you
can
do?
maybe
it
is,
maybe
it's
not.
i
mean,
but
the
point
is
whether
or
not
you
establish
a
rule
that
requires
some
request,
and
in
the
odd
case
there
will
be
a
debate
about
what's
a
request
or
not,
but
the
issue
is
the
general
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
why
don't
you
answer
justice
alito's
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
verrilli,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
verrilli.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-1529,
montejo
versus
louisiana.
