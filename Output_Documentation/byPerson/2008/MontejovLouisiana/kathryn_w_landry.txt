ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
generous
prophylactic
rule
of
michigan
v.
jackson
which
imputed
a
defendant's
request
for
counsel
in
one
forum,
i.e.,
his
arraignment,
to
another
forum
of
post-attachment
custodial
interrogation
should
not
be
expanded
in
this
case
to
a
defendant
who
has
done
nothing
whatsoever
to
make
such
a
request.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
yes.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
how
it
operates.
but
i
think
one
of
the
fallacies
of
petitioner's
argument
is
that
it
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
this
defendant
had
to
make
that
choice
at
that
moment
at
that
hearing,
and
that
is
not
what
we
have
asserted
either
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court
or
at
this
court.
our
position
is
he
needs
to
make
a
request.
whether
the
request
is
made
in
the
court
proceeding,
which
jackson
said
he
can
make
it
in
the
court
proceeding
and
it
applies
thereafter
to
critical
stages,
which
would
include
custodial
interrogation,
but
in
this
case
after
they
approached
him
again,
there's
no
request
at
the
hearing--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--because
subsequently,
when
the
police
approached
him,
again
there
being
no
request
prior
to
this
that
prohibited
them
from
approaching
him,
they
provided
him
with
his
miranda
rights,
which
patterson
says
is
sufficient
in
the
context
of
a
custodial
interrogation
that
takes
place
post-attachment.
they
provided
him
with
his
rights,
which
included
the
right
to
counsel,
and
he
then
waived
those
rights.
in
fact,
this
particular
defendant
on
seven
occasions,
three
of
which
--
four
of
which
were
pre-attachment
and
three
of
which
were
post-attachment,
was
given
his
rights,
including
the
right
to
counsel,
and
each
of
those
seven
times
waived
in
writing
those
rights.
our
position
is
what
he
needed
to
do
for
jackson
is
make
some
sort
of
request
or
some
sort
of
positive
assertion
that
he
was
asserting
his
request
for
counsel.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
no,
but
when
the
police
did
approach
him
after
that
72-hour
hearing,
they
advised
him
again
of
his
rights,
including
his
right
to
counsel,
and
asked
him
if
he
wished
to
waive
those
rights.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor,
because
in
patterson
the
court
said
that
the
miranda
rights
were
sufficient
to
apprise
a
defendant
of
his
post-attachment
sixth
amendment
rights.
did
they
tell
him
you
have
a
lawyer
appointed?
no.
in
fact,
detective
hall
testified
that
he
was
not
aware
of
the
72-hour
hearing
or
the--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--i
can't
answer
that
question.
i
can
only
answer
the
question
that
all
of
the
officers
testified
that
they
were
not
aware
that
counsel
had
been
appointed
for
the
defendant
that
morning.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
i
understand.
they
testified
that
they
weren't
aware
that
counsel
had
not
been
appointed
that
morning.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
yes,
sir.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
that's
correct.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
no,
i
don't
think
that
you're
wrong.
i
think
that
is
part
of
the
rationale.
what
jackson
is
trying
to
do
was
to
deter--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--yes,
but
i
also
thought
that
your
hypothetical
included
the
fact
that
he
told
the
police
that
he
had
a
lawyer,
i
retained
one
yesterday,
which
i
think--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--which
i
think
goes
further.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
to
me
that
connotes
under
jackson--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--well--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--i
would
disagree
with
your
last
hypothetical
because
if
a
defendant
goes
out
and
hires
a
lawyer
but
never
says
anything
to
the
police,
he
makes
no
request,
no
statement
to
them
regarding
the
lawyer--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--i
think
if
he
voices
to
the
police
some
type
of
positive
affirmation
--
i
have
a
lawyer,
i
got
a
lawyer
yesterday
--
to
me
that--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--well,
i
don't
know
that
you
can
presume
that.
i
mean,
you
would
be
overriding
the
testimony
of
the
officers.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
and
in
this
case,
even
if
you
presumed
that
they
knew
that
he
had
a
lawyer,
i
still
don't
think
it
overrides
the
key
issue
in
jackson
as
i
see
it,
which
is
his
request
for
counsel,
some
type
of
affirmation
or
statement
or
action
to
the
police
that
he
wants
to
deal
through
his
counsel.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
yes,
i
think
so.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
well,
i
would
disagree
with
the
characterization.
as
i
see
the
case,
the
question
is
jackson
turned
on
the
fact
that
that
defendant
had
asked
for,
had
requested
the
help
of
a
lawyer.
patterson
said
so.
patterson
said
jackson
turned
on--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--i
think
he
would
have
under
jackson.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
no,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
well,
probably
in
most
cases
nothing
is
said.
but,
again
--
and
that
goes
back
to
my
earlier
point,
the
police
then
approached
--
i
mean,
the
defendant
could
have
said
something
at
the
hearing,
but
presuming
nothing
was
said--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--no,
because
i
think
subsequently
if
he
doesn't
say
anything
when
the
police
approach
him,
they
tell
him
he
has
the
right
to
counsel,
and
at
that
point
he
can
exercise
that
right
and
say,
i
want
a
lawyer,
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you
without
a
lawyer.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
no,
i
think
there
does
have
to
be
a
request--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
finish
my--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--no,
we
believe
that
the
state
court
was
correct
when
it
held
that
some
type
of
positive
affirmation
--
and
that
to
me
is
the
whole
question--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--yes.
i
think
there
has
to
be
some
action--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--well,
whether
the
sixth
amendment
right
attached
i
think
is
a
different
issue
from
whether
the
jackson
rule
applies
to
then
bar
any
police-initiated
conversation
with
him,
and
the
issue
i
think
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
his
silence
--
the
petitioner
has
argued
that
the
mere
appointment
of
counsel
with
nothing
further
by
this
defendant
constituted
the
request
necessary
under
jackson
to
invoke
the
rule.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
but
your
honor,
i'm
not
requiring
a
formalized
request
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
at
the
hearing.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
no.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
no,
sir.
i
believe
that
he
can
remain
silent,
but
later,
just
as
in
this
case,
the
police
approach
him;
under
patterson
they
give
him
his
rights,
which
include
right
to
counsel.
at
that
point
he
can
request
and
invoke,
and
then
jackson
becomes
applicable
because
he
has
made
a
request.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
yes,
because
jackson
says
he
can
make
the
request--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--i
was
just
saying
he
can
make
it
either
time.
the
fallacy
of
their
argument
is
that
he
has
to
make
it--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--clearly
i
would
argue
against
any
such
presumption;
that's
the
whole
reason
--
the
key
to
jackson
was--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--yes,
i
do.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
well,
but
i
think
the
question
boils
down
to
whether
or
not
the
latter
hypothetical,
"yes,
i
want
one",
whether
that
is
enough
to
constitute
the
request
under
jackson.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
no,
you're
not
wrong.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
well--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
state
court
analysis
comes
from
--
well,
it
came
from
the
fifth
circuit
case
of
montoya
which
was
very
similar
factually,
and
the
fifth
circuit
relied
on
the
court's
opinion
in
patterson,
and
i
believe
cited
a
footnote
from
patterson
that
refers
to,
you
know,
affirmative
acceptance
of
the
appointment
of
counsel.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
but
also,
if
i
can
address
that
factual
issue,
because
i
think
it
is
important
in
the
context
here,
because
the
question
presented
to
this
court,
the
assignment
of
error
at
the
louisiana
supreme
court
was
only
premised
on
the
fact
that
counsel
was
appointed.
there
was
never
any
argument
--
they
bring
up
the
factual
issues
about,
well,
the
defendant
testified
at
trial
that
he
told
them
he
had
a
lawyer,
and
the
officers
testified
he
didn't,
to
make
it
appear
there's
a
factual
issue
there;
but
if
you
look
back
at
the
proceedings
in
this
case,
the
motion
to
suppress,
which
is
at
the
joint
appendix
page
6,
never
alleged
any
of
those
issues.
it
only
alleged
that
his
statements
were
not
free
and
voluntary.
then
the
suppression
hearing
comes.
now,
most
of
the
effort
at
the
suppression
hearing
was
toward
the
videotape
which
is
not
at
issue
here,
but
the
argument
by
the
defendant's
counsel
on
this
issue
was
merely
what
exactly
it
is
here,
that
the
mere
appointment
of
counsel
was
sufficient
to
trigger
jackson,
and
therefore
everything
after
that
should
not
have
been
admitted.
there
was
never
any
testimony
at
the
suppression
hearing
by
the
defendant
or
anyone
else
that
he
had
been
--
that
he
told
the
officers,
"i've
been
appointed
counsel",
"i
think
i've
been
appointed
counsel.
"
"i
think
i
might
have
a
lawyer.
"
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
that's
correct,
it's
just
the--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--because,
in
our
case
and
in
the
case
where
there's
just
counsel
appointed,
again
i
go
back
to
the
issue,
there's
no
request;
there's
no
positive
action
by
the
defendant
constituting
a
request
in
indicating
that
he's
requesting
a
lawyer,
which
was
the
basis
of
the
ruling
in
jackson.
it
was
--
and
patterson
later
said,
jackson
turned
on
the
fact
that
that
defendant
had
asked
for
a
lawyer.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
well,
i
would
disagree--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--i
was
going
to
say
that
i
disagree
to
the
--
to
the
extent
that
i
think
part
of
the
basis
of
jackson
was
wanting
to
deter
police
from
badgering
a
defendant
into
waiving
a
right
that
he
had
already
asserted.
that
was
the
crux,
it
seemed
to
me,
of
jackson,
that
this
defendant
had
asserted
his
right
to
counsel
at
the
arraignment.
they
then
approached
him
later.
and
the
court
found
that
that
was
a
form
of
police
badgering
to
then
approach
him
after
he
had
made
the
request
for
counsel.
and
i
believe
that
that's
one
of
the
differentiations
in
this
case,
where
we
talk
about
whether
there's
a
request
for
counsel.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
no,
i
don't
think
it
would.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
because,
again,
the
appointment
of
counsel,
as
in
this
case,
was
an
action
taken
by
the
state.
there
was
no
action
by
this
defendant
asserting
or
requesting
counsel.
this
was
a
state
action:
we're
appointing
counsel
for
you.
it's
a
pro
forma
thing
that
goes
on,
and
then
subsequently
they
go
through
the
paperwork
to
determine
whether
he's
qualified--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--to
receive
indigent
counsel.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
no,
your
honor,
because,
obviously,
just
as
patterson
discussed,
the
waiver
issue
is
much
different
when
you're
talking
about
a
defendant
proceeding
through
a
legal
proceeding
representing
himself
than
it
is
in
the
context
here.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
well,
it's
not
that
he
doesn't
need
help,
but
he's
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
can
voluntarily
choose,
exercise
his
own
free
will,
whether
he
wants
counsel
or
not.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
right,
and
i
think
that
that's
true
of
the--
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
--because,
again,
in
jackson,
the
assertion
or
the
request
for
counsel
is
what
implies
to
the
police
that
this
defendant
does
not
want
to
deal
with
the
police
on
his
own,
that
he
wishes
to
only
communicate
through
counsel.
and
the
sixth
amendment
right
that
attached
and
his
right
to
counsel
is
just
that:
it's
a
right.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
yes,
because
the
police
then
approach
him
under
patterson,
give
him
his
rights,
which
includes
the
right
to
counsel.
he
has
every
right
to
then
exercise
his
free
will,
if
he
didn't
do
so
at
the
hearing,
and
invoke
his
right
to
counsel.
ms.
kathryn
w.
landry
thank
you.
