justice

bader

mr.
verrilli,
the
defendant
himself
could
say,
"police,
i'd
like
to
talk
to
you.
"
that
would
be
okay.
but
this
is
police
initiation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
verrilli,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
scenario
here
was
the
defendant,
uncounseled,
was
taken
before
a
judicial
officer
who
read
him
rather
standard
information,
one
piece
of
information
was,
i'm
appointing
a
lawyer
for
you?
was
there
any
opportunity
for
the
defendant
to
say
anything
at
that
hearing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
didn't
get
--
he
didn't
in
fact
get
a
lawyer.
i
thought
he
was
told
that
the
public
defender--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--right,
and
the
actual
lawyer
didn't
show
up
until
later.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
he
have
an
opportunity
to
do
it
at
the
so-called
72-hour
hearing?
was
there
any
--
did
the
judicial
officer
ever
ask
him
anything
about
whether
he
wanted
counsel,
whether
he
accepted
counsel?
was
there
any
colloquy
between
them
at
all?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is
that
standard
operating
procedure
at
these
72-hour
hearings:
that
the
--
the
defendant,
who
is
there
uncounseled
is
--
is
just
standing
there,
and
the
judicial
officer
says:
i'm
appointing
counsel
for
you,
and
he
goes
on
to
the
next
thing
he's
telling
him?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
how
it
operates?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
anybody
ever
tell
him
he
needed
to
request?
i
mean,
he
had
just
been
told
by
a
judicial
officer:
i'm
appointing
counsel
for
you.
he's
not
counseled
at
that
point.
how
does
he
know
that,
in
order
to
protect
his
right
to
counsel,
he
has
to
make
some
kind
of
an
affirmative
assertion?
he's
just
been
told
he's
got
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
would
have
no
problem
at
all
with
the
argument
you
are
making
if
someone
had
told
him
that
he
needed
to
do
that.
but
he
didn't
have
a
judge
to
tell
him
that;
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
to
tell
him
that;
and
the
police
certainly
didn't
tell
him
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
very
puzzling.
this
is
an
experienced
police
officer.
the
72-hour
hearing
is
required
in
every
case
where
defendant
is
in
state
custody.
so
how
could
an
experienced
police
officer
not
know?
somebody,
by
the
way,
who
knew
this
man
had
been
kept
until
--
even
more
than
72
hours.
and
he
testifies
--
it's
true
that
detective
hall
testified:
i
didn't
know
that
he
appointed
--
had
been
appointed
a
lawyer.
the
very
same
day
that
he
got
to
the
72-hour
hearing
a
day
late,
how
could
he
not
have
known?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
louisiana.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
louisiana
supreme
court
say
there
has
to
be
a
request?
i
thought
they
said
there
had
to
be
some
action,
affirmative
act
of
acceptance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
just
that
everything
after
--
as
far
as
i
understand,
the
only
piece
of
evidence
we're
talking
about
is
his
condolence
letter
to
the
widow
which
amounted
to
a
confession
of
guilt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
no
other.
because
all
of
the
mirandized
pre
72-hour
hearing,
all
that
is
not
in
contest;
all
of
that
came
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
landry,
you're
trying
to
explain
your
position,
let's
assume,
to
an
intelligent
layperson,
and
the
first
example
is,
in
many
states
at
the
equivalent
of
the
72-hour
hearing,
the
defendant
is
told:
the
court
is
prepared
to
appoint
a
lawyer
for
you.
would
you
like
us
to
appoint
a
lawyer?
and
the
defendant
will
say
yes.
so
he
will
have
made
the
request
for
a
lawyer.
and
then
there
are
states
like
louisiana
where
this
is
a
rapid-fire
proceeding,
and
the
defendant
isn't
asked
any
questions,
he
isn't
asked
to
agree
or
disagree,
and
he
doesn't
have
any
lawyer
there
to
assist
him.
so
you
are
essentially
asking
the
court
to
make
a
distinction
between
defendants
in
the
same
position,
both
uncounseled,
both
not
knowledgeable
in
the
law,
but
the
one
who
has
the
good
fortune
to
be
in
a
state
where
the
judge
tells
the
defendant,
"you
have
a
right
to
have
a
lawyer.
"
"would
you
like
me
to
appoint
one?
"
and
then
this
procedure.
shouldn't
defendant's
rights
turn
on
that
distinction
in
the
state
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
verrilli--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
just
struck
two
chords:
one,
harmless
error;
the
other,
that
this
defendant
testified
at
his
trial.
we
have
held
that
a
defendant's
statements,
although
he
wasn't
given
his
jackson
right,
can
come
in
by
way
of
impeachment
if
he
testifies.
so
in
this
defendant's
case,
even
if
we
accept
everything
you
say,
the
--
that
condolence
letter
could
have
been
used
for
impeachment
purposes.
