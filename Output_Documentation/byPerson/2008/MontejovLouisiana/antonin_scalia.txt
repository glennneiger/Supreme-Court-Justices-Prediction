justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
the
rationale
of
jackson
was
that
the
confession
is
simply
deemed
to
be
coerced
if
the
defendant
has
expressed
--
has
expressed
--
his
desire
to
have
counsel
present
or
even
to
be
represented
by
counsel.
it
isn't
clear
that,
which
is
already
a
stretch,
to
assume
that
simply
because
i
said,
you
know,
i
would
like
to
have
counsel,
if
the
police
continue
to
say,
well,
come
on,
won't
you
talk
to
us
--
it's
already
a
stretch
to
say
it's
automatically
coerced.
but
now
you're
saying,
even
if
the
defendant
has
never
expressed
even
a
desire
to
be
represented
by
counsel
but
has
simply
had
counsel
appointed,
in
fact
even
if
he
doesn't
know
about
the
appointment
of
counsel,
the
--
his
confession
is
automatically
deemed
to
be
coerced.
that
seems
to
me
quite,
even
more
extravagant
than
jackson.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
what
has
he
elected
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why
would
one
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
that,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
initiates
the
contact.
i
mean,
in
civil
matters,
it's
contrary
to
the
ethics
of
the
bar
to
interrogate
the
party
on
the
other
side
when
you
know
he
has
a
lawyer,
and
that
would
be
the
case
even
if
he
initiated
it.
you
wouldn't
think
of
negotiating
with
him
without
consulting
the
other
lawyer,
saying,
"can
i
talk
to
your
client?
"
so
that
doesn't
stretch
over
to
this,
to
this
situation.
we're
not
applying
bar
ethical
rules.
we're
applying,
supposedly,
a
rule
that
determines
when
a
confession
is
coerced.
all
right?
that's
what
we're
doing
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
couldn't
we
solve
your
practical
problem
that
we
don't
know
in
many
states
whether
the
defendant
accepted
appointment
or
not,
by
simply
saying
it
is
not
enough
to
simply
accept
appointment
of
counsel;
you
must
have
requested
counsel.
to
merely
say,
"oh,
that's
great,
you
appointed
me
counsel--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
must
have
requested
it.
and
that
would
be
in
accord
with
the
holding
of
michigan
v.
jackson
and
would
solve
all
of
your
--
all
of
your
practical
problems.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
happens
under
michigan
v.
jackson
if
i
have
never
requested
counsel?
i've
never
asked
the
court
to
appoint
counsel,
but
i've
gone
out
and
hired
counsel
of
my
own,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clear
from
michigan
v.
jackson
itself,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
wouldn't
be
saying
that.
we
would
just
be
saying
that
it
is
unrealistic
to
think
that
a
confession
is
coerced
simply
because
the
police
initiated
the
conversation
so
long
as
he
said:
okay,
i'll
speak
without
my
counsel
present.
that's
all
we
--
i
don't
see
how
it
would
infect
any
of
these
other
areas.
it
would
just
say
that's
--
that's
one
bridge
too
far.
this
is
prophylaxis
on
prophylaxis.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true,
but
not
much
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
assume
that
his
voluntary
relinquishment
of
it
is
somehow
coerced.
i
mean
there
--
there
is
no
way
around
that.
the
man
has
said:
i
know
i
have
counsel,
but
that's
okay;
i'll
talk
anyway.
and
you
say:
so
long
as
the
police
have
initiated
that
conversation,
we
will
deem
it
to
be
coerced.
you
can't
get
around
the
coercion
aspect
of
--
of
this
matter.
but
that
question
is
whether
that
is
at
all
realistic.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
wrong.
i
think
it's
common
ground
that
so
long
as
he
says,
even
though
i
have
a
lawyer,
i'll
talk
to
you,
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
not
okay
in
civil
cases,
but
it's
perfectly
okay
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
landry,
i
don't
really
understand
what
you're
arguing
here.
i
thought
you
were
saying
there
has
to
be
a
request
in
your
response
to
justice
souter,
but
then
you
accept
as
sufficient
his
merely
saying
thank
you.
that's
not
a
request.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought,
too.
but
you
were
saying
there
had
to
be
a
request.
you
abandon
that?
there
doesn't
have
to
be
a
request?
justice
antonin
scalia
"thank
you"
is
not
a
request.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
agree
with
justice
souter.
i
--
acceptance
is
something
different
from
a
request.
as
i
read
the
--
the
state
court's
opinion,
it
was
setting
up
a
sort
of
offer
and
acceptance
scenario.
the
state
was
offering
him
counsel,
said,
"i
appoint
counsel",
but
it
was
ineffective
until
he
says
yes,
"i
accept
counsel",
whereupon,
you
know,
he's
lawyered
up,
but
he
isn't
lawyered
up
until
he
says
"i
accept",
and
that's
something
quite
different
from
--
from
requesting
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
are
you
--
are
you
standing
on
the
--
on
the
state
court's
analysis
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
usual
legal
rule
is
that
silence
implies
consent,
right?
read
the
prosecution
of
thomas
more.
that's
the
legal
rule.
so
why
shouldn't
we
assume
consent
just
from
the
fact
that
he
stood
silent?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
verrilli,
i
don't
understand
your
response
to
justice
ginsburg.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me,
if
this
thing
was
going
to
come
in
anyway,
how
could
you
possibly
say
it
was
harmful
and
not
harmless
error?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
introduced
in
the
case
in
chief
or
whether
it's
introduced
to
refute
the
defendant's
assertion
that
he
didn't
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
jesse
montejo
under
arrest
for
the
murder
of
lewis
ferrari
waived
his
miranda
rights
and
was
interrogated
by
the
police.
he
told
several
conflicting
stories
about
his
involvement
in
the
crime
ultimately
admitting
that
he
had
shot
ferrari
in
the
course
of
botched
burglary.
several
days
later,
montejo
was
brought
before
a
louisiana
court
for
a
preliminary
hearing
at
which
the
judge
ordered
on
his
own
initiative
and
as
required
by
state
law
that
counsel
be
appointed
to
represent
the
defendant.
later
that
same
day,
police
investigators
approached
montejo
at
the
prison
where
he
was
being
held
and
requested
that
he
accompany
them
on
a
search
for
the
murder
weapon.
montejo
again
waived
his
miranda
rights
and
agreed
to
go
along.
during
the
ride,
he
wrote
an
inculpatory
letter
of
apology
to
the
victim's
widow.
this
case
concerns
the
admissibility
at
trial
of
that
letter
of
apology.
louisiana
trial
court
allowed
prosecutors
to
introduce
the
letter.
montejo
was
convicted
by
the
jury
and
sentenced
to
death.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari.
in
the
case
called
michigan
versus
jackson,
this
court
held
that
“if
police-initiated
interrogation
after
a
defendant's
assertion
at
an
arraignment
or
similar
proceeding
of
his
right
to
counsel,
any
waiver
of
the
defendant's
right
to
counsel
for
that
police-initiated
interrogation
is
invalid.”
montejo
contends
that
this
decision
forbids
police
to
approach
any
represented
defendant.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
however
interpreted
the
precedent
to
mean
that
a
defendant
must
have
requested
counsel
or
otherwise
have
invoked
his
sixth
amendment
rights
in
order
to
trigger
the
jackson
rule.
in
louisiana,
as
in
almost
half
of
the
50
states,
counsel
is
automatically
appointed
for
indigent
defendants
and
so
montejo
did
not
make
a
specific
request
for
a
lawyer.
we
agree
with
montejo
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court's
view
of
the
jackson
rule
would
produce
an
unworkable
standard.
preliminary
hearings
are
often
not
transcribed
or
recorded,
they
tend
to
be
rushed,
and
defendants
do
not
always
attend.
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
courts
to
apply
a
request
or
invocation
standard
on
a
case
by
case
basis
attempting
to
divine
after
the
fact
whether
a
particular
defendant
expressed
verbally
or
otherwise
a
desire
for
representation.
of
course
courts
could
decline
to
apply
jackson
altogether
to
defendants
in
those
states
that
appoint
counsel
without
request,
but
that
would
surely
lead
to
arbitrary
results.1
on
the
other
hand,
montejo's
reading
of
the
case
is
untethered
from
the
original
rational
of
jackson.
our
case
has
make
perfectly
clear
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
not
to
interrogated
without
counsel
can
be
waived,
so
long
as
the
waiver
is
knowing
and
voluntary.
we
have
further
held
that
a
defendant's
waiver
of
his
miranda
rights
including
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel
during
interrogation
also
operates
to
waive
his
overlapping
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
jackson
adopted
a
prophylactic
exception
to
this
principle
designed
to
prevent
the
police
from
badgering
defendants
into
waiving
their
previously
asserted
right
to
counsel.
jackson
held
that
once
a
defendant
has
invoked
his
general
right
to
counsel,
a
later
waiver
of
counsel's
assistance
during
interrogation
will
be
presumed
to
have
been
unlawfully
coerced
unless
the
defendant
initiated
the
contact.
contrary
to
the
dissent's
view,
that
is
the
only
coherent
rationale
for
jackson
given
our
holdings
that
waivers
our
ordinarily
permissible
even
by
uncounseled
and
unrepresented
defendants.
of
course
this
antibadgering
theory
has
no
application
to
defendants
like
montejo
who
have
not
yet
expressed
the
desire
for
counsel
but
have
been
assigned
counsel
automatically
by
state
law.
given
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court's
approach
to
jackson
is
impractical
and
montejo's
approach
inconsistent
with
jackson's
rationale,
we
requested
briefing
on
whether
to
overrule
the
case.
we
now
do
so.
jackson
is
not
a
venerable
precedent,
it
was
decided
in
1986.
it
was
poorly
reasoned.
has
created
no
significant
reliance
interest
and
as
we
have
described
is
ultimately
unworkable.
the
benefits
of
the
jackson
prophylactic
rule
are
minimal.
because
of
the
protections
created
by
this
court
in
miranda
and
related
cases,
there
was
little
if
any
chance
that
a
defendant
will
be
badgered
into
waiving
his
right
to
have
counsel
present
during
interrogation.
our
cases
hold
that
if
a
defendant
requests
counsel
when
he
is
first
approached
for
interrogation
and
given
his
miranda
warnings,
not
only
is
the
immediate
interrogation
without
counsel
forbidden
but
any
later
consent
to
interrogation
without
counsel
will
be
deemed
coerced
if
the
police
can
initiated
the
contact.
this
is
enough
prophylaxis
to
protect
defendant's
fifth
amendment
right
from
badgering
an
enough
we
think
to
protect
his
overlapping
sixth
amendment
right
as
well.
jackson
however
with
respect
to
all
defendants
who
have
made
a
general
request
for
counsel
at
arraignment
prevents
investigators
from
even
seeking
an
uncounseled
interview
for
the
first
time.
the
considerable
adverse
effect
of
this
rule
upon
society's
ability
to
solve
crimes
and
bring
criminals
to
justice
far
outweighs
its
capacity
to
prevent
a
genuinely
coerced
agreement
to
speak
without
counsel
present.
we
therefore
overrule
michigan
versus
jackson.
although
we
agree
with
the
louisiana
supreme
court's
disposition
of
montejo's
jackson
claim,
we
remand
the
case
so
that
montejo
can
pursue
any
distinct
arguments
he
may
have
about
the
validity
of
his
miranda
waiver
which
takes
on
added
important
in
light
our
decision
today.
the
judgment
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
is
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
kennedy
has
joined.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
