justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
to
clarify
in
my
mind.
case
one,
the
defendant
has
no
lawyer.
he
is
--
they
give
him
miranda
warning.
he
says:
i
don't
want
a
lawyer.
okay.
now,
do
you
want
to
speak
against
yourself?
yes,
he
says,
i
do.
sorry,
strike
--
he
says:
no,
i
don't;
i
don't
want
to
say
anything,
but
i
don't
want
a
lawyer.
six
hours
later
the
policemen
say
to
him:
are
you
really
sure
that
you
don't
want
to
speak?
he
says:
well,
maybe
i
will,
and
he
makes
a
full
absolutely
voluntary
decision.
that's
okay
under
the
constitution,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
it's
the
same
case,
except
this
time
he
says:
i
have
a
lawyer;
i
hired
him
yesterday.
now
the
policeman
cannot
say,
are
you
sure?
is
that
correct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
law.
so,
the
law
is
--
and
the
reason
for
that
second
is
because
once
you
have
a
lawyer,
police
communicate
through
the
lawyer.
isn't
that
the
reason,
basically?
i
just
always
thought
that
was
the
reason.
once
a
person
has
a
lawyer,
another
lawyer
communicates
through
the
lawyer.
they
don't
go
and
talk
to
the
client.
i
thought
that
was
the
kind
of
rationale
for
it.
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
if
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
not
talking
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
trying
to
give
a
hypothetical
and
my
hypothetical
is
a
different
one
than
you
were
just
told.
in
my
hypothetical
the
person
has
a
lawyer,
and
i
thought
where
he
has
a
lawyer
the
police
are
not
allowed
to
go
and
ask
him
questions
about
whether
he
wants
to
waive.
of
course,
he
can
volunteer
it.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct,
that's
the
conundrum
of
the
case.
now
i
understand
it.
the
conundrum
of
this
case
is
he
didn't
tell
the
police,
i
have
a
lawyer.
he
had
one.
now,
if
he
had
hired
one
and
not
told
the
police,
it
would
be
the
same
result
as
we
just
said,
wouldn't
it?
if
he
had
one
but
didn't
tell
the
police,
the
police
could
not
initiate
questioning;
am
i
right
or
wrong?
all
i'm
driving
at
is
shouldn't
the
result
here
be
the
same?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
same
whether
you
hired
the
lawyer
or
the
same
whether
the
lawyer
was
appointed?
at
least
that's
what's
in
my
head.
and
if
you
can
show
me
that
you
want
the
same
result
in
both
cases,
that
would
go
a
long
way
towards
convincing
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
tells
some
of
the
police.
some
of
the
police
know.
it
just
happens
that
these
particular
ones
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
--
i'm
getting
a
different
idea
from
what
you're
arguing.
i
want
to
try
it
on
you
and
see
what
your
response
is.
it's
simply
this,
that
there's
something
backwards
about
this
case,
and
what's
backwards
is
this,
that
when
they're
talking
about
a
prophylactic
rule
in
jackson,
what
they're
thinking
of
is
the
following:
everyone
agrees
that
when
a
person
really
has
a
counsel,
at
that
point,
unlike
the
miranda
point,
the
police
cannot
talk
to
him
further,
though
he
can
initiate.
now,
everyone
agreeing,
what
do
we
do
with
a
case
where
a
person
doesn't
have
a
lawyer,
but
he
requests
one?
now,
in
such
a
circumstance,
we're
going
to
treat
it
as
if
he
had
one.
that's
the
prophylactic
part.
but
here's
a
case
where
he
really
has
one.
so
it
doesn't
fall
outside
jackson.
it
falls
within
the
basic
assumption
of
jackson,
that
the
difference
between
having
a
lawyer
and
not
having
a
lawyer
is,
if
you
have
a
lawyer,
the
police
can
initiate
nothing.
you
can't
talk
to
him.
now,
if
that's
right,
your
case
--
i
mean,
i'm
afraid,
their
side,
for
your
point
of
view,
is
a
fortiori
for
jackson,
not
the
borderline
of
jackson.
now,
explain
to
me
why
i've
got
it
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
accept
that,
for
argument's
sake.
accept
that,
and
then
same
--
same
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
interesting.
i
think
this
is
very
interesting
to
me
because
i'm
learning
a
lot.
suppose
--
let's
assume
justice
alito
is
absolutely
right
and
that
when
you
have
a
counsel,
that's
what
you've
done
and
that's
the
reason
why
you
don't
talk
to
the
police,
or
at
least
they
can't
initiate.
fine.
take
that
as
the
rationale,
and
now
apply
it
to
this
case.
since
he
has
a
lawyer,
whether
he
said
yes,
no,
maybe,
"i
accept"
or
not,
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
the
same
rationale
would
apply
or
would
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
