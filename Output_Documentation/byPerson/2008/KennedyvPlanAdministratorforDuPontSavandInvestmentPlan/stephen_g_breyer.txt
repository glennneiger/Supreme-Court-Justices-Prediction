justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
the
end
of
your
argument,
could
you
just
spend
a
minute
because
my
state
of
mind
is
i'm
sorry
we
limited
it.
you've
sort
of
briefed
this
question
pretty
fully.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'm
tempted
to
try
to
decide
it.
i
know
you
want
to
make
your
four
points.
go
right
ahead.
but
at
the
end,
could
you
possibly
say,
why
shouldn't
we
just
go
ahead
and
decide
the
substance,
not
as
a
technical
matter.
are
we
really
going
to
get
something
out
of
remanding
it
that
we
don't
already
know?
but
don't
do
that
now,
but
whenever
you
want.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
could
we
do
this?
i
mean,
what's
bothering
me
about
this
is
--
is
you
have
a
very
strong
argument
following
the
plan
documents.
they
have
had
some
chance
to
reply
to
it,
but
not
a
full
chance.
it
seems
a
little
unfair,
and
the
fifth
circuit
had
--
would
probably
know
what
they
say.
okay.
can
we,
say,
grant
the
question
now
and
ask
that
people
file
an
additional
brief
if
they
want
to
say
something?
it
just
seems
to
me
an
awful
waste
of
money
and
everybody's
time
to
send
it
back
and
have
it
make
another
trip.
so
what's
your
suggestion
as
to
how
we
proceed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see,
i
want
to
be
fair
to
them.
i
mean,
we
want
--
you
want
to
be
fair
to
the
other
side
to
be
sure
they
have
a
chance
to
say
everything
they
have
to
say.
that's
what's
worrying
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
doesn't
make
too
much
sense,
does
it,
where
all
that
happens
is
it's
just
waived.
the
wife
waived
the
amount
because
when
she
waived
the
amount,
she
doesn't
give
it
to
anybody.
she
just
doesn't
take
it.
so
it
goes
to
the
beneficiary
--
it
goes
to
the
person
who
made
up
the
plan.
it's
a
little
hard
to
pay
to
him,
because
he
is
dead.
so
i
mean
if
you
read
it
literally,
it
doesn't
seem
to
apply,
these
(ii)
and
(iii),
to
the
case
before
us,
which
is
a
case
of
waiver.
and
of
course
the
argument,
yes,
she
makes
is
that
throughout
the
law,
waiver
is
treated
differently.
and
if
it
weren't,
you'd
have
to
pay
gift
tax,
for
example,
when
you
waive
a
benefit
that's
given
to
you
by
someone
else.
and
so
let's
interpret
this
and
make
sense
of
the
language
you
quoted,
and
consistent
with
the
rest
of
the
law
to
say
a
waiver
is
waivered.
it's
not
giving
something
to
somebody
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
argument
is
against
you
and
i
would
like
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
--
i
didn't
follow,
i'd
have
to
admit.
i
think
--
and
you
perhaps
can
explain
it
to
me
--
but,
i
thought
the
things
that
you
are
quoting
are
qdro
is
about
an
effort
to
alienate
some
property
that
would
otherwise
go
to
the
person
who
was
setting
up
a
qdro,
in
other
words,
the
wife
here,
in
other
words
liv
here;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
the
one
person
who
couldn't
be
an
alternate
payee
is
the
payor.
and
so,
in
fact,
when
you
waive
something,
it
isn't
that
it
necessarily
goes
back
to
some
alternate
payee,
as
it
didn't
here.
it
simply
went
back
to
the
payor.
and
so
the
language
of
this
prevision
you're
quoting
just
doesn't
deal
with
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
do,
and
that's
what
i
need
to
ask.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
it
says,
if
it's
not,
the
issue
to
wit
is
not
resolved,
then
the
plan
administrator
shall
pay
the
segregated
amounts
to
the
person
or
persons
who
would
have
been
entitled
to
such
amounts
if
there
had
been
no
order.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
think
that
includes
the
giver,
the
payor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
where
this
goes
if
you
waive
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
five
minutes
behind.
i
just
got
your
point
on
the
(iii)(1).
i
see
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay?
i
get
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
go
back
for
a
second
because,
while
i
got
it
five
minutes
late,
if
i
have
it
right,
i
still
don't
see
why
congress
would
have
done
it
literally.
i
think
what
you're
saying
is:
"read
the
full
four
pages.
"
"what
those
four
pages
say
are,
judge,
you
have
an
order,
a
divorce
decree.
"
"it's
defined
as
an
order.
"
"look
at
it.
"
"it's
qualified
or
it
isn't.
"
"if
it's
qualified,
pay
the
money
to
the
person
it
names.
"
"if
it's
not
qualified,
pay
the
money
to
the
person,
namely
liv,
who
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
amount
if
there
had
been
no
order.
"
okay.
you
read
that
literally
as
you
want
and
what
it
says
is:
"liv,
you're
being
divorced.
"
"you
want
a
divorce;
your
husband
wants
a
divorce;
you're
going
to
be
divorced.
"
"you
cannot
waive
the
benefit
under
the
plan.
"
now,
why
would
congress
not
want
her
to
be
able
to
waive
it?
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can
understand
an
antialienation
provision.
that's
some
guy
who
is
going
to
come
along
and
grab
this
money
when
you
want
to
take
care
of
a
widow,
and
you
want
to
take
care
--
but
--
but
this
isn't
that.
it's
just
--
she
just
wants
to
waive
it;
she
doesn't
want
it.
that's
the
widow
herself.
okay,
so
why
would
congress--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
--
is
the
wife
--
i'm
thinking
of
the
chief
justice's
question,
too.
if
your
--
the
woman
is
the
wife
of
x,
and
x
has
a
pension.
doesn't
something
vest,
say
if
she's
in
california?
doesn't
she
have
some
vested
right
to
some
of
that
pension?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
she's
married
for
40
years
to
joe
smith,
joe
smith
earns
a
pension
and
then
he
wants
a
divorce.
doesn't
she
have
some
right
to
some
of
that
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
she
get
some
of
the
money
he
saved?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
not
exactly
that
you
could
have
just
changed
the
beneficiary.
if
you
just
changed
the
beneficiary,
you'd
have
to
give
her
something
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
the
divorce
proceeding
she's
going
to
get
some
of
the
money,
which
is
now
justice
ginsburg's
point,
to
which
she
is
entitled.
so
obviously
she
will
get
something,
but
she's
entitled
to
it.
