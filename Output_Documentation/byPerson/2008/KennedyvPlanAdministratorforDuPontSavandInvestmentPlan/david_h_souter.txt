justice
david
h.
souter
we
can't
decide
this
case
based
on
sympathy
to
dupont.
i
would
understand
the
point
of
your
argument.
but
if
--
in
theory
the
problem
would
be
exactly
the
same,
whether
dupont
had
expressed
a
doubt
and
paid
it
into
the
estate
or
hadn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
have
the
same
question
before
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
--
isn't
the
problem
that
it
must
be
an
indirect
arrangement,
and
what
you
are
arguing
for
here
is
an
indirect
effect.
and
it
has
that
indirect
effect
on
your
reasoning
because
of
the
--
of
the
waiver
and
because
of
probate
law.
and
it
seems
to
me,
as
i
read
the
--
the
irs
reg,
the
"arrangement"
that
it's
referring
to
is
an
arrangement
which
in
and
of
itself
would
--
would
effect
the
transfer.
and
that
is
not
the
case
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
person
who
acquires
it
--
the
only
entity
that
acquires
it
is
the
estate.
justice

the
second
of
the
case
as
i

this

and

no.
07-636.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
decedent,
william
kennedy,
worked
for
dupont
and
participated
in
its
saving
and
investment
plan
governed
by
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
or
erisa.
the
plan
allows
the
participant
to
designate
a
beneficiary
to
receive
funds
upon
--
upon
the
participantâ€™s
death
as
well
as
means
for
changing
that
designation.
if
no
beneficiary
is
designated,
the
benefits
go
to
the
decedent's
estate.
william
kennedy
designated
his
wife
liv
as
his
beneficiary,
but
by
the
terms
of
a
subsequent
divorce
decree,
liv
waived
her
right
to
the
plan
benefits.
william
did
not,
however
changed
his
beneficiary
designation
form.
upon
william's
death,
the
plan
paid
the
benefits
to
liv
in
accordance
with
william's
designation.
the
petitioner,
kari
kennedy,
william's
daughter
and
executrix,
brought
suit
against
dupont
and
the
plan
administrator
claiming
that
liv's
waiver
meant
that
the
estate
was
entitled
of
the
benefits.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
estate,
the
fifth
circuit
reversed.
it
held
that
liv's
waiver
was
barred
by
erisa's
anti-alienation
provision
which
requires
pension
benefit
plans
to
provide
that
plan
benefits
may
not
be
assigned
or
alienated,
a
provision
that
the
fifth
circuit
believed
invalidated
liv's
waiver.
the
court
of
appeals
emphasized
that
erisa
carves
out
an
exception
to
the
anti-alienation
bar
for
a
divorce
decree
that
constitutes
a
qualified
domestic-relations
order
or
qdro,
but
that
the
divorce
decree
here
was
not
a
qdro
and
therefore,
could
not
be
honored.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
affirm
but
we
do
so
and
reasoning
different
from
the
fifth
circuit's
rationale.
liv's
waiver
was
not
barred
by
erisa's
alienation
provision.
it
would
be
unusual
to
speak
of
liv's
waiver
as
an
assignment
or
alienation
since
she
did
not
control
who
would
receive
the
benefits
in
her
stead.
and
we
do
not
see
how
the
fifth
circuit's
analysis
can
be
squared
with
certain
waivers
that
are
plainly
permissible.
for
example,
the
spouse's
ability
to
waive
her
right
to
survivor
benefits
or
beneficiary
is
qualified
disclaimer
of
benefits
under
the
tax
code.
given
these
concerns,
we
looked
to
the
common
law
of
trust
which
informs
our
interpretation
of
erisa.
the
anti-alienation
provision
is
similar
to
a
spendthrift
provision
and
a
trust.
and
while
such
a
provision
bars
a
beneficiary
from
assigning
benefits,
it
permits
a
disclaimer
of
benefits
so
long
as
the
disclaimer
makes
no
attempt
to
designate
who
is
to
receive
the
benefits.
the
same
principle
applies
here
and
indeed
the
treasury
department
interprets
its
own
regulation
on
the
subject
to
permit
a
waiver
as
such
liv's
so
long
as
there
is
no
attempt
to
direct
the
interests
to
another
person
and
this
interpretation
is
controlling
here.
the
qdro
provisions
have
no
bearing
on
this
question
as
they
require
a
transfer
would
be
made
to
an
ultimate
payee.
they
do
not
provide
a
mechanism
for
a
pure
waiver
and
they,
therefore,
cannot
be
read
to
suggest
that
such
a
waiver
by
non-qdro
is
barred.
nevertheless,
we
hold
that
the
plan
administrator
properly
disbursed
the
benefits
to
liv.
erisa
requires
the
administrators
to
manage
erisa
plans
in
accordance
with
the
documents
and
instruments
governing
them.
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
plan
administrator
did.
the
plan
documents
rule
allows
employers
to
establish
a
uniformed
administrative
scheme
and
ensures
that
administrators
do
not
have
to
wade
through
a
sea
of
diverse
non-plan
documents
making
difficult
determinations
about
the
meaning
and
enforceability
of
those
documents.
requiring
a
plan
administrator
to
enforce
a
waiver
that
did
not
conform
to
the
plan
documents
would
be
counted
to
erisa's
statutory
command
and
would
lead
to
the
very
sorts
of
administrative
problems
that
the
plan
documents
rule
is
meant
to
avoid.
