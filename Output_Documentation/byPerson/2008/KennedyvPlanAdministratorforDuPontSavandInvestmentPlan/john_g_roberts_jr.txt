chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-636,
kennedy
v.
the
plan
administrator
for
dupont
savings
and
investment
plan.
mr.
furlow.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry;
six
weeks
before
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
how
does
the
plan
know
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
plan
terms
say
that
if
you
want
to
change
the
beneficiary,
here's
how
you've
got
to
change
the
beneficiary;
and
we
are
going
to
pay
the
beneficiary
until
it's
changed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
your
friend
on
the
other
side
would
be
quoting
that
language.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
--
that's
a
bit
of
a
stretch,
isn't
it?
it
says
no
beneficiary
designation
is
in
effect.
if
you
look
at
the
plan,
he's
got
a
beneficiary
designation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
in
the
opinion
of
the
company.
that
sounds
--
and
this
is
a
plan
--
as
we've
said
often
in
erisa
cases,
we
want
to
enforce
these
according
to
the
terms
of
the
plan
because
the
companies
don't
have
to
set
these
up
at
all.
so
it
makes
perfect
sense
for
the
company
to
say,
well,
if
we
think
this,
then
we
can
do
this.
so,
in
other
words,
there's
a
doubt
and
we
don't
want
to
give
it
to
somebody
who
might
not
end
up
being
the
person,
but
if
we
don't
think
there's
a
doubt,
that's
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
of
course
you
only
think
the
solicitor
general
is
right
so
far
to
a
certain
extent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
you
throw
them
under
the
train
because
you
don't
--
you
certainly
don't
think
they
are
correct
by
saying,
look,
the
only
way
you
can
do
this
is
by
modifying
the
plan.
i
still
don't
know
how
the
plan
administrator
is
supposed
to
know
that
the
person
whose
name
appears
on
the
plan
documents,
which
the
plan
participant
can
change
at
any
time,
isn't
the
person
that
they
are
supposed
to
send
the
benefits
to.
now,
you
tell
me
here
they
knew
about
the
divorce
and
all
that
stuff.
maybe,
maybe
not.
but
we
are
trying
to
develop
a
rule
for
all
cases
and
it
seems
to
me
the
easiest,
most
administrable
rule
is
to
say
whoever's
name
appears
there
gets
the
money,
and
if
they
are
not
supposed
to
because
of
some
collateral
dispute,
well,
they
can
sort
that
out
in
litigation.
maybe
kari
has
a
suit
against
mrs.
kennedy
or
her
estate,
but
that's
not
a
matter
for
the
plan
to
worry
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
must
have
missed
--
where
did
watergate
come
from.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
kruger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
there
is
a
fairly
sharp
circuit
split
on
that
question,
even
that
majority
of
the
circuits
are
contrary
to
the
government's
position?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
which
circuits
are
on
the
other
side?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
levy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
but
is
that
a
case
in
which
the
question
the
court
decided
was
presented
in
the
petition,
the
court
said
we
are
not
going
to
take
that
question
then
they
decided
it
on
that
ground
anyway.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
you
agree
that
it's
a
question
of
which
the
circuits
have
split,
so
presumably
there
are
good
arguments
on
both
sides,
and
it's
one
that
your
friend
hasn't
had
a
full
opportunity
to
brief
here.
so
we'd
have
to
be
pretty
confident
of
the
answer,
i
think,
to
go
ahead
and
decide
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
--
why
do
they
have
to
worry
about
that?
the
simplest
thing
is
for
the
participant
to
change
the
designation,
and
if
there's
a
divorce,
the
divorcee
is
no
longer
a
spouse
under
the
terms
of
the
plan,
so
he
is
free
to
do
that.
it
seems
odd
to
me
that
they
have
this
elaborate
qdro
provision
when
it
shouldn't
be
necessary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
another
alternative
is
that
all
you
can
--
you
can
cross
out
this
name
and
put
in
another,
or
you
can
go
to
court,
get
this,
qualify
it
as
a
qdro,
file
it
with
the
plan.
i
mean,
why
would
anybody
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not,
not
obviously.
i
mean
it
depends
what
the
divorce
is.
she
got
the
mercedes,
right?
i
mean,
she
can
get
--
it
depends
on
the
divorce
arrangement,
not
anything
under
erisa,
once
she
is
a
nonspouse.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
furlow,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
look
at
it
and
say,
is
this
a
qdro?
and
if
no,
then
they
go
back
to
the
other
provision,
i
guess
on
page
21a
in
the
red
brief,
and
say:
if
it's
not
a
qdro,
ignore
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
anything
more
to
say
on
the
plan
document,
the
plan
document
issue
than
what
you've
said
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
