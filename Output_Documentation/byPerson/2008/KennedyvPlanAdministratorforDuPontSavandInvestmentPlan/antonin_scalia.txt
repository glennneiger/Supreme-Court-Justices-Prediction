justice
antonin
scalia
we
know
what's
going
to
happen
on
remand,
though,
don't
we?
doesn't
the
fifth
circuit
already
have
case
law
on
--
on
that
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
sorry.
does
this
appear
somewhere
in
the
materials?
it's
always
helpful.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
your
point.
it
would
seem
to
me
your
point
is
that
the
qdro
is
an
exception
to
the
assignment
or
alienation.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
point
is
this
has
been
no
assignment
or
agency,
so
we
don't
need
the
qdro
exception.
there
is
nothing
in
here
that
violates
anything
in
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
whether
he
could
have
done
a
qdro
or
not
is
in
your
view
irrelevant.
you
don't
have
to
come
forward
with
excuses
of
why
he
didn't
and
so
forth,
your
basic
case
is
the
qdro
is
an
exception
from
the
prohibition
on
assignment
or
alienation,
that
provision
has
no
application
here,
there
has
been
no
assignment
or
alienation,
and
therefore
the
waiver
is
effective.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
--
i
mean,
we
could
have
--
you
know,
we
should
have
thought
of
that
when
we
limited
our
--
our
grant
of
certiorari
to
the
--
to
the
one
question
on
which
you
agree
with
the
petitioner.
but
we
did
do
that,
didn't
we,
even
though
the
other
one
was
--
was
explicitly
put
under
our
nose,
and
we
said
we
--
we
are
not
going
to
get
into
that?
we
just
want
to
decide
this
question,
which
is
an
important
question
all
by
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
other
case
in
which
we
have
explicitly
declined
to
accept
a
question
and
then
have
used
one
of
these
other
back
doorways
of
--
of
answering
it
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
of
any.
i
mean
maybe
--
maybe
we
have
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--did
--
did
we
recognize
in
earlier
cases
that
beneficiary
designations
are
plan
documents?
justice
antonin
scalia
again,
assuming
there
has
been
a
change
of
beneficiary
designation,
and,
of
course,
the
argument
you're
confronted
with
is:
i
haven't
changed
anything.
the
prior
beneficiary
simply
--
simply
refused
to
accept
it,
waived
it.
i
haven't
changed
the
designation
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
it's
a
harder
question
than
you
make
it;
and
i,
for
one,
have
not
gone
into
it
as
deeply
as
i
would
like
to,
principally
because
we
rejected
that
--
that
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
we've
done
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--rejected
the
question
and
then
decided
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i'm
asking.
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
sure
of
the
answer.
you
don't
know
of
any
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
the
classic
case
but
for
the
fact
that
we
had
rejected
that
question.
had
we
not
been
asked
to
decide
it
and
said
no,
it
would
be
the
classic
case,
i
agree.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
we
expect
that
to
happen
in
future
cases
when
we
turn
down
a
question
and
amici
and
people
come
in
and
brief
the
question
anyway
and
then
ask
us
to
decide
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
undoubtedly
we
should
have
granted
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
would
i
find
the
latter?
if
i
wanted
to
read
it?
which
i
do.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
21a?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
also
goes
to
the
question
of
who
is
the
person
or
persons
who
would
have
been
entitled
to
such
amounts
if
there
had
been
no
order.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there
was
a
waiver
and
there
had
been
no
order,
your
friend's
contention
is
by
traditional
common
law,
the
person
who
would
have
been
entitled
to
it
would
have
been
his
client.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
this
language
helps
you.
it
sort
of
restates
the
question,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there
had
been
no
order--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
i
see.
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see
your
point.
does
he
agree
with
that,
that
apart
from
the
divorce
decree,
there
is
no
waiver?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
got
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
the
waiver
is
in
the
order?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
without
the
order,
there
has
been
no
waiver.
justice
antonin
scalia
we'll
have
to
see
whether
your
friend
agrees
with
that.
i'll
bet
he
doesn't.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
they
had
agreed
to
the
waiver
apart
from
--
apart
from
the
--
from
the
domestic
relations
order?
just
apart
from
that,
they
have
a
separate
signed
waiver.
we'd
be
in
the
same
suit
that
you're
--
that
you
say
we
have
to
avoid,
wouldn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it's
an
alienation,
but
his
point
is
that
a
waiver
is
not
an
alienation.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
some
other
waiver
that's
--
that's
not
in
connection
with
a
--
with
a
domestic
relations
thing?
you
know
--
"i've
made
my
--
my
eldest
son
a
beneficiary.
"
it
turns
out,
you
know,
he
is
fat
and
happy;
he
doesn't
need
the
money
and
he
agrees
to
waive
it,
so
--
so
i
can
give
it
to
an
impecunious
daughter.
okay?
what
--
what
happens
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
oh,
oh,
oh.
you're
jumping
over
to
the
other
argument.
let's
leave
that
argument
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you
would
still
--
the
plan
would
still
have
to
make
some
inquires,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
not
getting
in
the
plan
documents.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
--
that's
the
point
that
troubles
me.
it's
--
it's
the
"acquirer's"
language.
does
--
does
the
person
who
--
who
receives
the
--
the
refused
benefit
acquire
it
from
the
other
person?
he
certainly
doesn't
do
so
for
federal
tax
purposes.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
he
acquire
it
from
a
participant
or
beneficiary?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
--
the
notion
is
it's
as
though
the
--
it's
as
though
the
devise
to
the
person
refusing
it
had
never
occurred.
i
mean,
there
is
--
there
is
no
gift
tax
payable
or
anything
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
this
waiver
only
part
of
the
divorce
decree?
do
you
agree
with
your
friend
on
that
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
separate
and
apart
from
the
divorce
decree.
