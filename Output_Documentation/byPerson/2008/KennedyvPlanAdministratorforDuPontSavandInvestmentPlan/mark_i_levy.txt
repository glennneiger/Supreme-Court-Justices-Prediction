mr.
mark
irving
levy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
light
of
the
court's
questions,
i
want
to
begin
with
the
plan
documents
argument
and
first
the
procedural
question
of
whether
it's
properly
before
the
court.
we
think
that
it
is.
it's
well
within
the
settled
doctrine
of
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance.
it
was
raised
below,
and
the
fifth
circuit
has
decided
the
issue
in
other
cases.
we
don't
dispute
that.
so
we
know
what
the
fifth
circuit
thinks
about
this
issue,
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
point
in
a
remand.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
i
do.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
i
apologize
if
it's
not
in
the
brief,
but
a
case
i
could
find
was
called
piper
aircraft
versus
rayno
454
u.s.
235.
and
in
that
case
the
court
limited
its
grant
of
certiorari,
but
then
went
ahead
and
decided
a
question
that
wasn't
subsumed
within
that
question
because
they
found
it
appropriate
to
the
proper
disposition
of
the
case.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
i
think
piper
is
at
least
a
first
cousin
if
not
a
direct
sibling
of
the
issue
that
we've
got
here.
i
don't
disagree
that
it
is
in
the
court's
discretion.
the
court
has
discretion,
i
think,
one
--
either
way
whether
it
wants
to
decide
this
or
wants
remand,
but
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--well,
actually
i
think
the
court
will
be
confident
if
it
looks
into
it.
but
beyond
that
this
is
the
classic
case
of
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance
of
the
judgment.
when
that
arises,
the
topside
party
always
has
to
deal
with
that
issue
in
its
reply
brief
and
only
in
its
reply
brief.
so
there
is
nothing
unfair
about
the--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--and
i
agree.
that
makes
it
within
the
court's
discretion.
it
doesn't
have
to
decide
it,
but
we
think
there
are
good
reasons
here.
it's
been
fully
briefed,
including
by
the
petitioner
for
the
reason
i
just
said.
four
amici
have
addressed
it;
we
have
addressed
it.
so
it's
properly
before
the
court,
and
there
is
nothing
unfair
about
deciding
it.
in
addition--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--i
wouldn't
think
so.
the
fact
that
we
can't
find
another
case,
either,
i
think
makes
this
one
unique.
and
i
think
there
are
good
reasons--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--i
would
be
loathe
to
make
that
suggestion,
justice
ginsburg.
[laughter]
but
it
may
well
--
it's
possible
that
that
could
be
the
explanation
or
the
court
with
fuller
consideration
--
i
mean,
the
issue
has
been
fully
briefed.
the
court
knows
more
about
the
issues
than
it
did
at
the
time
it
granted
cert,
and
we
think
it
is
for
a
--
to
decide
this.
and
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
questions.
both
the
question
granted
and
the
question
that
wasn't
granted
--
wasn't
denied,
but
it
wasn't
granted
--
raise
similar
considerations.
they
both
get
into
the
same
statutory
scheme.
they
both
get
into
the
same
considerations
of
plan
administrability.
we
think
it
would
be
most
efficient
for
the
court
to
resolve
the
conflict
now
and
not
leave
the
uncertainty
to
continue
any
further.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
well,
in
the
fullness
of
time,
the
court
can
now
revisit
that.
but
again,
i
think
it
has
been
fully
briefed
and
there
is
nothing
unfair
to
the
petitioners.
the
court
in
its
discretion--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--yes
----
[laughter]
--i
would.
i
take
it
the
court
doesn't
need
argument
on
the
merits
of
the
plan
documents
issues,
since
that's
already
been
discussed,
so
let
me
turn
to
the
qdro
question.
that
is
the
question
that
was
--
that
was
granted
and
was
discussed
fully
in
the
briefs.
now,
as
to
the
qdro
part
of
the
case,
the
rule
of
law
that
governs
this
case
is
that
pension
plan
administrators
must
pay
benefits
in
accordance
with
a
qualified
domestic
relations
order,
and
they
may
not
pay
benefits
in
accordance
with
a
nonqualified
order.
that
rule
follows
from
two
separate
and
different
analyses.
one
is
the
anti-alienation
provision,
and
the
other
is
the
qdro
provision
in
subparagraph
(h)
of
section
1056.
they
are
both
discussed
in
our
brief.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
i
don't
find
this
all
that
pleasant
reading,
but
it's
on
page
21a
of
the
statutory
appendix
to
the
red
brief.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
21a.
and
it's
(h)(ii)
and
(iii).
and
i
want
to
start
with
this
because
it
is
really
is
the
more
straightforward
analysis
and
avoids
a
lot
of
questions
under
the
anti-alienation
provision.
this
argument
would
prevail
whether
or
not
the
purported
waiver
is
deemed
to
be
an
assignment
or
alienation
under
1056(d)(1)
and
(d)(3).
now,
we
think
it
is
and
i'll
come
back
to
that
under
the
irs
regulation,
but
let
me
start
with
this
alternative
argument
that's
also
made
in
the
brief.
under
erisa,
a
domestic
relations
order
is
either
a
qualified
order
or
a
nonqualified
order.
and
erisa
expressly
provides
that
if
it's
a
nonqualified
order,
as
it
is
here,
the
plan
administrator
may
not
pay
benefits
pursuant
to
that
order.
justice
scalia,
since
you're
on
page
21a,
let's
look
at
subparagraph
(h)(iii).
this
is
21a
of
the
red
brief.
it
provides
that:
if
an
order
is
not
qualified,
the
plan
administrator
shall
pay
the
benefits
to
the
person
or
persons
who
would
be
entitled
to
such
benefits
if
there
had
been
no
order.
if
there
had
been
no
order.
in
other
words,
the
administrator
disregards
it
and
pays
it
to
the
person
--
this
is
in
(iii),
justice
scalia.
contrast
that
with
subparagraph
(h)(ii)
right
above
it,
where
the
order
is
qualified:
the
administrator
shall
pay
the
benefits
to
the
person
entitled
thereto
under
the
order.
so,
it
gives
you
two
choices.
if
it's
a
qualified
order,
the
plan
must
pay.
if
it's
not
a
qualified
order,
the
plan--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--you've
covered
a
lot
of
ground,
justice
breyer.
i
want
to
give
you
several
responses--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--and
i
appreciate
that.
first
of
all,
on
this
part
of
the
argument
under
the
qdro
provision
under
subparagraph
(h),
it
doesn't
matter
whether
this
is
a
waiver
or
not.
that
goes
to
the
alienation
question,
and
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
little
while.
this
applies--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--if
there
were
no--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--on
the
contrary,
justice--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
it
is
not
only
helpful
but
dispositive.
the
order
that
is
referred
to
is
the
divorce
decree,
the
qualified
domestic
--
i'm
sorry
--
the
domestic
relations
order.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
if
there
had
been
no
order--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--then
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
waiver
by
liv.
i
mean,
excuse
me
--
yes,
by
liv.
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
waiver
if
there
weren't
any
divorce
decree
because
the
waiver
is
contained--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--in
the
decree.
so,
if
there
were
no--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--i'd
hesitate
to
speak
for
him,
but
i
think
the
language
is--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--quite
clear,
and
that's
why
this
is
a
more
straightforward
analysis
than
the
waiver
under
anti-alienation.
i
do
hope
to
get
to
that.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
but
this
is
really
very
straightforward
and
dispositive.
and
the
legislative
history
confirms
this.
the
plain
text
is
clear,
but
the
legislative
history
confirms
it.
congress
took
a
specific
look
at
this
specific
issue
in
a
specific
context
of
marital
dissolution,
and
it
enacted
this
qdro
provision.
and
the
provision
is
comprehensive
and
complete.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
no.
it
has
to
go
to
an
alternate
payee.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
wife.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
well,
i
think
it
does,
justice
breyer.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
where
it
goes.
it
just
says
if
it's
a
qdro,
you
pay
it,
and
if
it's
not
a
qdro,
you
don't
pay
it.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
yes.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
no.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
i
don't
believe
so,
because
the
"if
there
had
no
order"
clause
refers
to
the
domestic
relations
order,
a
divorce
decree.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
yes.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
that's
correct.
and
the
statute
says--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--that's
what
made
horse
races.
let
me
just
say
a
further
word
about
the
legislative
history
of
this
and
then
come
back
to
the
anti-alienation
provision,
justice
breyer,
if
i
--
if
i
might.
congress
made
it
clear
that
benefits
are
to
be
paid
pursuant
to
an
order
qdro;
in
other
words,
the
order
be
a
qdro
in
order
to
be
paid.
congress
was
mindful
of
the
burdens
that
nonqualified
orders
put
on
plan
administrators
and
it
purposely
sought
to
avoid
that
by
requiring
that
an
order
be
a
qdro,
a
qualified
order,
in
order
for
there
--
for
there
to
be
payment.
the
qdro
provision
is
an
objective
checklist
that
is
easy
for
--
for
plan
administrators
to
follow.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
i
don't
think
so.
i
mean
i
think
that
would
be
an
alienation.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
right.
and
i
will
come
to
that,
but
the
point
here
is
that
this
arises
and
can
only
arise
in
a
domestic
relations
context.
that's
where
qdro
applies,
and
the
fifth
circuit's
holding
was
that
that
was
the
sole
mechanism
for
the--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--well,
first
of
all,
that
would
run
squarely
into
the
plan
document's
argument.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
if
it's
not
a
marital
dissolution
context,
then
qdro
wouldn't
apply
one
way
or
the
other.
now,
in
that
context,
i
think
what
you're
suggesting,
justice
scalia--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--not
--
well,
just
on
--
not
getting
to
the
plan
documents.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
it
would
be
a
different
case.
i
mean,
this
case
involves
what
congress
specifically
looked
at
and
specifically
did
in
the
context
of
marital
dissolution,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
a
marital
dissolution
comes
up
all
the
time.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
it's
a
commonplace
in
these
benefits
issues,
and
these
are
high-volumes
operations.
the
plan
administrators
aren't
lawyers.
congress
wanted
bright-line
rules
that
could
be
easily
applied
here,
not
general
principles
to
be
applied
for
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
particular
case,
highly
fact-intensive,
highly
subjective
inquiries.
congress
didn't
want
any
of
that.
it
didn't
want
the
plan
administrator
to
have
to
look
behind
the
face
of
the
order
to
the
circumstances
of
the--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--okay.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
it
didn't
want
the
plan
administrators
to
have
to
try
and
divine
the
intention
of
the
parties,
didn't
want
the
plan
administrators
to
have
to
hold
a
factfinding
hearing
before
it
could
pay
plan
benefits.
that
is
completely
foreign
to
the
efficient
and
simple
operation
that
congress
had
in
mind.
now
let
me
turn
to
the
anti-alienation
issue
about
which
there
have
been
several
questions.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
i
believe
it
must
follow
the
beneficiary
designation.
indeed,
my
understanding
is
it
has
a
fiduciary
duty
and
a
legal
requirement
to
follow
the
plan
designation.
now,
the
plan
might
specify
alternatives.
here,
for
example,
the
plan
said,
here's
a
form
that
you
fill
out.
and
william
kennedy
filled
it
out
with
respect
to
a
different
plan,
the
pension
and
retirement
plan.
but
where
the
plan
says,
"we
will
pay
the
designated
beneficiary.
"
--and
that's
what
this
plan
says
--
then
the
plan
administrator
is
required,
as
i
understand
it,
to
pay
that
designated
beneficiary.
now
let
me
say
a
word
since
this
came
up,
although
it's
not
really
central
to
the
change
of
beneficiary
designation
that
william
filed
for
this
other
plan
that's
not
now
before
the
court,
the
pension
and
retirement
plan.
and
i
would
say
only
two
things
about
that:
one
is
at
ja
62,
and
if
you
look
at
it,
it
says
in
the
title
and
it
says
in
the
body
of
the
document
that
this
applies
to
the
pension
and
retirement
plan.
we
don't
think
anyone
could
have
thought
that
it
applied
to
other
plans
and
that
william
therefore
was
changing
the
beneficiary
as
to
those
other
plans.
in
fact,
at
ja
28
in
paragraph
10,
there
was
a
stipulation
of
fact
in
the
district
court
that
william
never
changed
the
designation
as
to
the
savings
and
investment
plan,
the
sip
that
is
before
the
court
today.
so
it
was
not
only
not
raised
below,
it
was
stipulated
away
and
i
think
that
was--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--i
don't
think
the
issue
--
i
mean,
a
lot
depends
on
the
wording.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
two
things:
one,
we
think
that
purpose
does
apply
here.
i
mean,
the
point
of
anti-alienation
provision
is
to
guard
against
the
temptation
to
trade
off
future
pension
benefits
in
exchange
for
immediate
economic
gain
or
advantage.
that's
exactly
what
liv
did
in
the
divorce.
she
got
the
mercedes,
she
got
other
things.
she
traded
off
her
pension
benefits,
and
we
think
that
falls
squarely
within
the
purpose
of
the
anti-alienation
provision.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
that's
the
first
and,
i
think,
most
important
answer.
the
other
thing
is
that
we
are
not
saying
--
our
position
today
does
not
mean
that
divorcing
parties
can
--
can
be
foreclosed
from
eliminating
the
death
benefits
--
the
death
benefits
for
the
designated
beneficiary;
but
they
have
to
follow
procedures
that
comply
with
erisa.
the
most
--
the
most
direct
and
simplest
one
is
the
change
of
beneficiary
form.
william
didn't
do
that
here.
that's
undisputed.
they
could
have
entered
into
a
qdro,
and
that
would
have
gone
--
the
money
would
have
gone
to
liv
as
an
alternate
payee.
that
would
have
taken
the
benefits,
consistent
with
erisa,
away
from
liv
and
given
them
to
kari.
they
could
have
done
that.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
it's
not
necessary.
it's
simply
another
alternative,
but
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
most
direct
and
straightforward--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--they
wouldn't
have
to.
now,
let
me
turn
to
this
issue
about
what
is
an
assignment
or
alienation
when
we
disagree
with
our
friends
from
the
solicitor
general's
office.
we
think
liv's
purported
waiver
here
was
an
assignment
or
alienation
within
the
irs
definition.
the
irs
regulation
is
reprinted
at
page
15
of
the
body
of
the
red
brief,
and
it
provides
that
assignment
or
alienation
is
defined
to
include
any
direct
or
indirect
arrangement
whereby
a
party
acquires
an
interest
from
the
beneficiary.
and
i've
left
out
the
not
--
the
not-critical
language
for
present
purposes.
so
it
talks
about
an
indirect
arrangement
whereby
a
party
acquires
an
interest
from
the
beneficiary.
now,
the
government
argues
that
that
definition
requires
that
the
beneficiary,
first,
must
direct
the
transfer
and,
second,
it
must
direct
it
to
a
third
party.
the
government's
argument
rests
not
on
the
language
of
the
regulation
that
i
just
read
but
on
a
legal
argument
that
this
is
what
terms
meant
at
common
law.
but
that
position
simply
can't
be
squared
with
the
language
of
the
regulation.
as
i
just
said,
the
regulation
includes
an
indirect
arrangement
within
the
definition
of
"assignment
or
alienation".
mr.
mark
irving
levy
well,
we
think
it
is.
the
arrangement
here
effected
transfer
to
the
estate
under
the
plan
default
rule.
the
estate
was
next
in
line.
so
if
this
is
a
relinquishment
--
i
don't
want
to
use
the
word
"waiver".
but
if
this
is
a
relinquishment
of
her
interest,
then
it
went
to
the
estate.
that's
what
the
plan
provides,
but
it's
not
just
the
phrase
"indirect
arrangement"
that
we
rely
on,
justice
souter.
it's
also
the
phrase
"a
party
acquirer".
it
doesn't
say
a
party
acquirer
at
or
by
the
direction
of
the
beneficiary.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
well,
that's
back
to
the
disclaimer,
justice
scalia.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
yes,
that's
right
under
the
default
rule.
and
if
the
default
rule
had
a
--
if
the
plan
had
a
different
default
rule,
under
the
default
rule
maybe
it
goes
to
the
children.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
he
acquires
it
from
the
beneficiary
list.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
well,
there
is
no
gift
tax
payable
if
it's
a
qualified
disclaimer,
and
it
won't
be
in
a
divorce
case
because
there
will
be
consideration
and
that
prevents
a
qualified
disclaimer.
so
that's
a
different
situation,
but
the
word
"acquired"
doesn't
mean--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--the
--
it's
--
under
the
gift
tax
code
justice
ginsburg,
section
2518
defines
a
qualified
disclaimer,
which
means
you
don't
pay
gift
tax
on
it.
it's
as
if
the
interest
had
never
been
transferred.
and
one
of
the
conditions
of
that
qualified
disclaimer
is
that
the
disclaimant
not
accept
any
interest
or
any
of
its
benefits.
so
if
there
is
consideration,
if
the
person
is
in
a
better
position
than
they
would
have
been
because
they
received
consideration,
then
it
won't
be
a
qualified
disclaimer
for
gift
tax
purposes.
but
there
won't
ever
be
a
disqualified
disclaimer
for
that
reason
in
a
--
in
the
divorce
context.
it
simply--
mr.
mark
irving
levy
--in
her
own
pension?
mr.
mark
irving
levy
well,
i
think
under
section
1055
there's
a
right
to
different
annuities.
that
that
was
a
new
provision
in
the
retirement
equity
act
in
1984.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
yes,
she's
entitled
to
it.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
after
the
divorce
she
is
not
entitled.
it's
only
a
spouse
who
is
entitled
to
the
benefits.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
right,
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
mark
irving
levy
once
she
is
a
nonspouse
she
is
no
longer
entitled
to
those
benefits
under
erisa
section
1055.
