mr.
david
a.
furlow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
this
court
has
confined
consideration
of
the
matters
before
the
court
to
certiorari
issue
number
5
concerning
qualified
domestic
relations
orders,
or
qdros
as
they
are
called,
i
will
confine
my
argument
to
arguing
that
the
fifth
circuit
erred
in
holding
that
the
only
way
a
divorcing
spouse
can
waive
the
right
to
pension
benefits
is
by
executing
a
qdro.
i
have
four
basic
arguments
to
present
today.
i'll
give
them
in
thumbnail
sketch
form
first.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
yes,
your
honor.
i
did
so
after
stating
that
we
believe
that
the
matter
was
properly
confined
to
the
certiorari
issue
number
three,
but
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
and
subject
to
objection
i
did
respond
to
the
argument
leveled
against
us
by
i
think
it
is
five
amici
and
by
dupont
itself.
we
nevertheless,
i
prepared
my
original
briefing
on
the
merits
to
address
the
qdro
issue
and
that's
where
you
see
it
focused.
we
have
four
basic
issues.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
instead
this
court
might
choose
well
to
follow
what
the
concurrence
said
in
the
recent
larue
v.
dewolff,
boberg
case,
emphasizing
that
where
the
court
of
appeals
below
has
not
passed
on
the
central
issue
of
a
case
and
where
most
of
the
fire
that
the
one
party
is
responding
to
comes
from
amici,
that
it
is
appropriate
to
remand
the
case
to
that
court
so
that
that
court
may
pass
on
the
central
issue,
especially
in
the
situation
where,
as
here,
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
even
mention
the
plan
document's
role,
but
based
its
decision
solely
on
a
misinterpretation
of
the
qdro
language.
of
course,
here,
in
the
interest
of
candor,
dupont
did
in
fact
address
in
brief
format
--
a
page
or
to,
several
pages
--
in
its
motion
for
summary
judgment
the
plan
document's
role
and
raised
that
matter
again
in
the
fifth
circuit.
it's
just
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
consider
or
pass
on
that
because
it
relied
solely
on
dupont's
argument
that
the
fifth
circuit
should
adhere
to
what
it
believed
to
be
the
department
of
treasury's
interpretation
of
the
anti-alienation
statute.
the
department
of
the
treasury
and
the
department
of
labor,
now
in
a
harmonized
stance,
have
come
forth
and
in
their
amicus
for
the
government
supports
our
position
that
the
fifth
circuit
erred
in
its
interpretation
of
the
qdro
statute,
and
that's
the
position
we
take.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
the
fifth
circuit
already
has
case
law.
they
have
stated
that,
but
they
consider
some
of
the
other
cases
and
they
might
consider
this
court's
ruling
addressing
the
interpretation
of
the
qdro
provision;
that
might
provide
them
additional
enlightenment
as
to
how
they
should
address
the
other
issue.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
i
do
not
believe
so,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
well,
your
honor,
there
was
that
provision
for
invoking
another
beneficiary
and
we
only
pointed
out
that
indeed
three
days
after
the
divorce,
and
consistent
with
his
ex-wife's
waiver
of
any
right,
title,
claim
and
interest
in
this
401(k)
plan
in
specific,
and
that
was
the
very
first
item
of
the
things
that
he
retained
as
the
plan
participant
in
that
divorce
decree,
he
did
in
fact
designate
his
sole
daughter
kari
kennedy
as
his
sole
beneficiary
in
a
change
of
form
plan
for
one
part
of
this
very
complex
series
of
multiple
plans
--
of
plan
retirement
benefits
where
he
said
that
he
would
give
--
that
she
would
be
his
sole
beneficiary;
and
the
form
there
that
dupont
drafted
for
him
said
that
it
invoked
and
superseded
any
and
all
prior
designations,
and
was
not
limited
to
that
one
particular
part
6
pension
and
retirements
plan.
and
so
we
submit
it
is
a
reasonable
explanation,
if
he
did
not
believe
that
his
wife
had
waived
any
right,
title
and
interest
to
invoke
that
beneficiary
clause,
pursuant
to
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
just
six
weeks
beforehand
in
the
brandon
v.
travelers
international
case
that
said
that
a
waiver
of
erisa
benefits,
welfare
benefits
mainly
--
but
erisa
waiver
of
benefits,
a
voluntary
waiver
was
enforceable,
was
valid
and
could
be
enforced
at
summary
judgment.
we
believe
his
counsel,
you
know,
were
aware
of
that
in
formulating,
you
know,
this
waiver
of
benefits.
even
if
that
didn't
take
care
of
liv
kennedy's
knowing,
voluntary,
attorney-negotiated,
court-approved,
signed-by-her
waiver
of
any
right,
title,
claim
and
interest
in
his
pension
benefits,
then
we
believe
he
may
have
believed
as
a
layman
that
by
signing
that
beneficiary
designation
form
prepared
by
dupont,
that
he
had
indeed
superseded
and
revoked
all
prior
designations.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
your
honor,
i
might
--
i
might,
if
i
would,
just
offer
an
explanation.
he
almost
certainly
saw
no
reason
to
revoke
that
which
his
wife
had
just
four
days
before
voluntarily
waived
any
right,
title,
claim
and
interest
to
in
terms
of
the
divorce.
he
certainly
would
have
expected
that
her
word
would
be
her
bond
and
that
it
wouldn't
turn
out
to
be
a
junk
bond
as
it
turned
out
to
be
when
years
later
she
repudiated
her
own
voluntary
waiver;
and
that's
just
one
of
the
issues
that
we
address.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
well,
your
honor,
the
way
i
see
it
is
that
his
attorneys
who
were
advising
him
and
guiding
him
through
this
process,
they
were
acting,
we
must
assume,
in
complete
awareness
of
texas
and
fifth
circuit
law;
and
the
fifth
circuit
had
just
ruled
some
six
weeks
before
in
a
case
involving
voluntary
divorce
decree
waivers
that
such
a
waiver
was
enforceable.
now
you
don't
have
to--
mr.
david
a.
furlow
--before
the
divorce
decree
in
the
brandon
v.
travelers
international
case.
we
believe
that
there
was
no
sense
there
in
bombing
the
rubble.
if
it
was
already
taken
care
of,
it
didn't
have
to
be
taken
care
of
the
second
time.
now,
i
and
you
might
want
a
belt-and-suspenders
approach
to
be
absolutely,
doubly,
positively
sure.
but
the
fundamental
thing
is
if
under
federal
common
law,
as
a
majority
of
courts
and
almost
all
of
the
state
courts
have
ruled,
a
voluntary
waiver
is
enforceable,
then
that
was
already
taken
care
of.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
the
plan
knows
that,
as
here,
when
the
court-appointed
fiduciary,
the
executrix
kari
kennedy
makes
the
plan
aware
of
that
on
april
26,
2001,
via
fax
and
delivery,
which
is
acknowledged
by
their
plan
administrator,
mary
deneen
that's
coming
in,
and
there
you
have
a
copy
of
the
divorce
decree
served
on
dupont
months
before
they
make
a
payout.
and
it
is
critical
here,
your
honor,
that
when
they
chose
to
make
this
--
you
know,
when
they
chose
to
pay
the
beneficiary,
they
were
working
on
a
test
case
right
there
from
the
very
beginning.
and
if
you
look
at
their
paralegal's
letter,
who
actually
notifies
the
estate
that
they
are
going
to
disregard
the
voluntary
test
case,
they
refer
to
dupont's
success
in
raising
this
issue
before.
and
then
the
paralegal
actually
quotes
a
fifth
circuit
case
that
holds
for
voluntary
waivers,
obviously
not
understanding
the,
you
know,
crucial
import
here;
and
we
note--
mr.
david
a.
furlow
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
also
say
that
the
plan
forms
here
at
page
48
of
your
joint
appendix,
and
49
--
i
ask
this
court
to
scrutinize
these
two
provisions
because
they
are
critical
to
the
outcome
of
the
case.
at
page
48
you
hear
the
following
mandatory
language
in
dupont's
own
sip.
and
it
says:
"if
no
surviving
spouse
exists
and
no
beneficiary
designation
is
in
effect,
distribution
shall.
"
--mandatory
term
--
"shall
be
made
to
or
in
accordance
with
the
directions
of
the
executor
or
administrator
of
the
decedent's
estate.
"
and
so
we
say
that--
mr.
david
a.
furlow
--well,
your
honor,
i
like
to
bring
a
fresh
insight
to
the
--
to
the
--
to
the
petitioner's
argument
here
because
i
see
that
language
and
we
say
it
is
not
in
effect.
this
court
has
ruled
in
several
cases
what
the
term
erisa
cases
saying
this
version
of
erisa
was
in
effect,
meaning
valid
and
operational.
well,
the
voluntary
waiver
was
in
effect
and
that
made
the
beneficiary
designation
some
10
years
before
during
the
course
of
the
marriage
ineffectual,
invalid.
and
so--
mr.
david
a.
furlow
--but
it's
not
in
effect
at
the
time
that
it
comes
to
be
decided
because
their
plan
administrator
mary
deneen
has
a
copy
of
the
divorce
decree
with
the
knowing
voluntary
waiver.
and
although,
your
honor,
although
they
take
the
position
that
plan
administrators
can't
understand
knowing
and
voluntary
waivers,
that
that's
a
law
sort
of
thing,
they
have
got
one
in-house
counsel
there
who
was
never
called
upon
to
actually
pass
on
this
matter
and
it
wouldn't
have
cost
them
a
dime
to
go
outside
of
that
in-house
counsel.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
yes.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
well--
mr.
david
a.
furlow
--your
honor,
we
submit
that
people
all
the
time
in
situations
like
this
may
believe
that
a
knowing
voluntary
waiver
which
has
received
the
approval
of
the
majority
of
the
federal
appellate
courts
and
the
state
courts
is
good
enough.
in
some
other
instances,
they
forget.
they
forget
to
do
this
or
to
make
those
changes,
or
believe
that
one
of
a
series
of
multiple
and
overlapping
beneficiary
designations
has
--
as
the
june
7th
one
did,
we
submit
--
revoked
and
superseded
any
and
all
prior
designations,
and
they
are
lay
people
not
lawyers.
now,
i
would
submit
that
the
critical
thing
is
also
on
page
49
the
very
portion
of
the
joint
appendix
that
you're
looking
at,
because
that
language
says,
in
the
dupont
sip
plan,
quote,
"if
in
the
opinion
of
the
company
there
is
a
question
as
to
the
legal
right
of
any
beneficiary
to
receive
a
distribution
under
the
plan,
the
amount
in
question
may
be
paid
to
the
decedent's
estate
in
which
event
the
trustee
and
the
company
shall
have
no
further
liability
to
anyone
in
respect
to
such
amounts.
"
consider
that
when
you've
heard
all
of
the
fear
mongering
that's
come
in,
in
the
amici
briefs
with
respect
to
--
to
interpleader
actions.
and
we
submit
that
interpleader
actions
are
a
perfectly
good
means
of
disposing
of
this,
but
if
you--
mr.
david
a.
furlow
--and
that's
the
first
step
in
the
analysis,
your
honor,
because
the
second
step
is
all
of
this
supreme
court
case
and
all
of
the
substantial
expenses
that
this
estate
out
of
jasper,
texas,
has
had
to
pay
from
the
very
beginning
could
have
been
avoided
had
they
paid
over
to
kari
kennedy,
a
court-appointed
executrix
who
would
have
taken
that
money
in
and
would
have
been
bound
by
the
rules
of
the
probate
court
to
handle
it
as
a
fiduciary
to
consider
liv's
claim
that
her
voluntary
waiver
was
not
voluntary,
to
pay
the
creditors
first,
rather
than
get
stuck
with
the
tax
liabilities,
which
happened
here.
the
important
thing
is
dupont
could
have
avoided
all
of
this
litigation,
would
not
have
had
to
file
an
interpleader,
would
not
have
had
to
incur
a
dime's
worth
of
attorney's
fees,
would
not
have
had
to
put
its
own
interest
ahead
of
that
of
the
participants
and
beneficiaries,
had
they
simply
invoked
this
clause
as
they
had
the
power
to
do.
they
chose
this
case.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
the
problem--
mr.
david
a.
furlow
--the
qdro
question,
your
honor?
mr.
david
a.
furlow
yes,
and
that's
why
we
say
that
if
you
look
carefully
at
--
excuse
me,
but
it's
29
u.s.c.
section
1056(b)
through
(k)
--
you
look
at
the
specific
language,
and
i
am
asking
this
court
to
adhere
to
the
specific
written
terms
of
the
erisa
statute
because
those
require
a
transfer
to
an
alternate
payee.
that
is
our
fundamental
argument:
a
transfer
to
an
alternate
payee
which
is
defined
in
1056(d)(3)(k)
as
being
someone--
mr.
david
a.
furlow
--respondents'
brief,
your
honor,
and
you
will
find
it
specifically
on
pages
14a
and
15a,
in
the
appendix
in
the
back.
and
if
you
actually
go
to
the
language,
we
stand
on
a
plain-meaning
interpretation
of
the
erisa
statute,
this
reticulated
and
complicated
statute.
we
say
every
word
has
its
meaning.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
specifically,
your
honors,
pages
14a
and
15a
of
the
respondents'
appendix,
where
he
has
actually
given
us
all
of
the
qdro
statute
at
1056.
and
we
say
that
has
meaning,
and
that
means
we
prevail
because,
if
you
look
at
that
language,
every
subpart
is
talking
about
payments
to
alternate
payees.
1056(d)(3)(k),
and
you
will
find
that,
your
honors,
specifically
at
page,
at
page
22a
to
23a
in
the
appendix.
the
alternate
payees
there
that
we
are
talking
about
are
spouse,
ex-spouse,
child,
or
other
dependent.
it
does
not
refer
to
the
plan
participant
mr.
kennedy;
and,
therefore,
there
was
no
--
his
mere
retention
of
his
pension
benefits
and
his
wife's
waiver
of
her
contingent
beneficiary
payments,
which
would
only
come
to
her
upon
the
death
of
william
kennedy,
meant
there
was
no
transfer,
not
a
dime's
worth
of
money,
not
a
bit
of
pension
benefits
transferred
on
the
date
that
she
signed
that
waiver.
there
was
thus
no--
mr.
david
a.
furlow
--your
honor,
the
way
pension
planners
understand
it
is
that
you
use
a
qdro
for
a
transfer
of
benefits,
not
for
a
bare
waiver.
and
that's
where
the
u.s.
solicitor
general
supports
our
position
and
reads
this
and
says
that's
consistent
with
treasury's
own,
now
harmonized
with
labor's,
interpretation
of
the
anti-alienation
clause.
it
does
not
apply
to
bare
waivers
of
benefits,
and,
therefore,
the
fifth
circuit
erred
in
putting
within
a
qdro
context
his
wife's--
mr.
david
a.
furlow
--we
think
that--
mr.
david
a.
furlow
--with
respect
to
her
waiver
that
would
have
required
him
in
advance
to
decide
who
he
would
have
transferred
what
alternate
payee
he
would
transfer
way
back
at
the
time
of
his
divorce
in
1994.
he
did
not.
he
did
not
transfer
anything
to
his
wife.
she
didn't
receive
anything
at
that
time.
she
simply
waived
her
contingent
right
to
receive
something
upon
his
death,
something
that
would
occur
in
the
future.
she
thoroughly
waived
that.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
i
agree--
mr.
david
a.
furlow
--i
completely
agree
with
that
analysis.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
that's
exactly
our
position
your
honor,
yes.
so
we
find
support
in
that
and
we
find
support
in
not
only
treasury's
interpretation
of
its
own
regulation,
which
deserves
great
deference
under
this
court's
opinion,
especially
when
dupont
in
the
fifth
circuit
asserted
that
it
was
department
of
treasury
that
had
all
of
the
expertise
pursuant
to
congressional
mandate
in
determining
how
qdros
should
apply
and
told
the
fifth
circuit
to
follow
their
outdated
interpretation
of
the
qdro
statute.
they
certainly
are
not
in
a
position
to
say
that
the
expertise
that
they
touted
in
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
disregarded
now,
and
we
submit
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
solicitor
general
are
correct
in
saying
that
the
regulation
does
not
mean
what
dupont
says
it
does,
but
means
what
kennedy
says
it
does.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
to
a
certain
extent.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
well,
your
honor,
let
me
address
that.
first,
we
don't
throw
the
solicitor
general
under
the
tracks.
we
simply
point
out
the
fact
that
they
have
gone
off
track
in
terms
of
their
plan
documents.
and
specifically,
your
honor,
i
would
say
i
agree
with
the
manning
versus,
the
manning
decision
of
the
texas,
of
the
fifth
circuit,
which
we
cited.
in
there
that
says
that
sections
1102
and
1104
of
erisa,
that's,
justice
scalia,
29
u.s.c.
sections
1102
and
1104,
are
a
very
thin
reed
indeed
to
on
which
to
cobble
together
a
plan
document's
rule.
and
specifically
dupont
then
goes
one
bridge
too
far
going
way
beyond
that
to
say
that
these
ever
meetable
ever
changeable
beneficiary
changes
thousands
of
them
constitute
documents
where
the
ninth
circuit
conity
substitutes
of
what
constitutes
plan
documents
in
the
salaried
employees
of
hughes
versus
hughes
administrator
case
and
said
that
a
list
of
the
participants
and
their
addresses
could
not
be
considered
a
plan
document
cause
it
did
not
correspond
with
that
detailed
listing
of
the
plan
document
under
section
1024
and
1025.
indeed
under
section
29
u.s.c.
section
1025,
your
honors,
if
these
are
plan
documents
then
the
administrator
has
a
duty
to
disclose
them
to
any
person,
participant,
or
beneficiary
who
asked
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
pointed
out
there
is
substantial
dangers
there
of
going
way
beyond
what
congress,
a
very
liberal
watergate
congress
in
1974,
intended
erisa
to
be,
which
is
a
protection
for
participants
and
beneficiaries,
not
for
plan
administrators.
and
it
exposes
those
participants
and
beneficiaries
to
loss
of
privacy,
telemarketing,
and
other
things
because
one
person
could
get
such
a
list
and
sell
it
to
others.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
just
putting
in
context
the
intentions
of
the
1974
congress,
which
was
concerned
about
participants
and
beneficiaries.
those
were
the
sole
purposes
for
which
section
1102
was
designed
to
protect,
not
the
convenience
of
plan
administrators
as
dupont
would
lead
this
court
to
believe.
i
see
that
i'm
into
rebuttal
time.
i
would
like
to
save
some
for
the
rest.
thank
you.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
thank
you,
your
honor.
chief
justice
roberts,
you
were
asking
about
the
evidence
earlier
with
respect
to
the
possession
in
dupont
office
own
files
of
the
divorce
decree
and
of
the
notice
that
was
given
saying:
please
don't
pay
liv;
she's
already
waived
all
of
her
benefits.
you
will
find
that
on
page
76
of
the
joint
appendix
in
the
sworn
amended
affidavit
of
mary
dineen,
the
plan's
administrator,
specifically
at
paragraph
20,
page
76,
where
she
says
in
bold:
26,
2001,
letter
from
kari
kennedy
duckworth
--
"exhibit
no.
1
was
maintained
as
a
record
of
dupont
with
regard
to
the
sip
account
of
william
patrick
kennedy.
"
that's
joint
appendix
76,
paragraph
20.
it
was
within
the
regular
course
of
business
of
dupont
to
maintain
a
copy
of
this
letter
with
other
dupont
letters
relating
to
mr.
kennedy's
sip
account
at
the
time
the
letter
was
received
from
its
sender.
the
letter
is
then
attached
as
the
next
exhibit
that
follows
on.
that
would
be
about
pages
78
to
79.
and
there
it
says
the
divorce
decree
was
attached.
make
no
mistake:
dupont
had
that
divorce
decree
and
could
see
the
knowing,
voluntary
waiver
and
had
it
well
in
advance
of
making
its
decision
to
pay
money
to
a
woman
who
went
off
to
norway
and
paid
her
when
she
was
over
there,
where
there
was
no
prospect
of
grabbing
it
back
and
turning
it
over
to
the
executor.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
well,
your
honor,
it's
more
interesting
than
that,
actually,
in
that
if
you
look
to
page
68
of
the
joint
appendix
you'll
see
mary
dineen,
the
administrator,
was
saying,
quote:
"had
liv
kennedy
disclaimed
her
designation
of
the
beneficiary
of
mr.
kennedy's
sip,
that
declination
or
disclaimer
or
a
copy
would
have
been
included
in
the
beneficiary
designation
file.
"
so
they're
taking
disclaimers
or
waivers.
they're
taking
declinations,
which
is
a
fancy
latin
way
of
saying
waiver.
they've
got
them
in
their
files.
they're
acting
on
it.
but
here
they
decided
to
pay
the
money
to
the
person
who
has
voluntarily
waived,
knowing
the
issue,
not
asking
their
in-house
counsel
at
no
cost
to
make
an
examination
here.
and
why?
so
that
they
can
later
take
this
plan
documents
rule
and
take
it
all
the
way
to
this
court.
but--
mr.
david
a.
furlow
--well,
this
waiver
was
the
part
in
which
liv
kennedy
waived
all
right
so
that
he
retained
all
of
his--
mr.
david
a.
furlow
--it
was
not
separate
and
apart.
in
fact,
when
they
were
transferring
benefits
they
knew
what
to
do
and
they
used
the
waiver
to
transfer
part
of
the
benefits.
it
is
interesting,
your
honors,
that
they
talked
about
the
plan
documents
rule,
but
their
own
documentation
says,
their
own
plan
says,
that
the
only
plan
documents
--
and
i
quoted
it
here
on
page
25
of
our
reply
brief
--
"the
official
plan
documents
are
the
e.i.
dupont
de
nemours
&
company
savings
and
investment
plan
and
the
trust
agreement.
"
not
beneficiary
designations.
so
they
give
no
notice.
mr.
david
a.
furlow
oh,
i
could
come
up
with
lots
of
things.
that's
a
bad
idea.
