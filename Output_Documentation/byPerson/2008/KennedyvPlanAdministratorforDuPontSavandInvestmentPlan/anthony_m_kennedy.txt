but
again
as
a
preliminary
matter,
am
i
on
the
same
page
with
justice
ginsburg?
or
would
it
be
a
different
question?
i'm
curious
to
know
why
the
beneficiary
designation
and
change
provisions
at
page
48,
number
29c,
beneficiaries,
couldn't
have
been
invoked
here.
is
that
the
same
question
justice
ginsburg
was
asking?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
the
plan
does
contain
a
procedure
for
designating
some
other
beneficiary,
including
the
spouse.
i
just
don't
understand
why
anybody
doesn't
talk
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
that
was
the
point
of
my
earlier
point.
i
focused
on
--
on
this
whole
paragraph.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
just
indicates
that
this
would
have
been
a
different
case
if
the
provision
of
the
plan
that
said
there
shall
be
no
assignment,
which
is
quoted
in
the
fifth
circuit
thing,
was
the
only
provision
in
the
plan;
but
when
you
look
through
this
in
retrospect,
there
are
means
for
participants
and
beneficiaries
to
make
a
change,
and
they
weren't
followed
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
understand
that
you
say
in
effect
they
were.
i
understand
that
argument
but
it's
not
as
if
the
plan
didn't
contain
an
adequate
vehicle
if
the
--
the
parties
had
followed
strictly
the
terms
of
the
plan.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
want
me
to
read
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
the
provisions
of
page
49
of
the
appendix
consistent
with
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
court
of
appeals
give
short
shrift
or
overlook
that
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
like
to
argue
the
question
that
is
here?
