you
did
in
your
reply
brief
address
the
plan
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
problem
is
that
is
that
if
you,
even
if
we
hold
for
you
on
that
issue,
you
could
still
lose
on
the
plan
documents
rule,
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
he
might
have
--
he
might
have
decided
that
he
didn't
want
to
revoke
that
one.
we
--
we
just
have
no
way
of
knowing.
it's
odd
that
he
revoked
as
to
one
plan
but
not
the
501(k)
plan,
as
i
understand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
because
he
could
--
he
could
have
--
despite
her
waiver,
he
could
have
named
her
as
the
beneficiary
of
that
plan
and
that
would
have
controlled.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
there
is
a
question
of
the
way
it
was
phrased.
and
perhaps
the
court
just
didn't
get
it,
what
that
question
on
which
we
didn't
grant
cert
was
driving
at.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
do,
leaving
the
plan
--
the
beneficiary
designation,
you
say
that
the
plan
administrator
is
not
required
to
give
effect
to
a
waiver
that
conflicts
with
the
beneficiary
designation.
is
it
just
not
required?
does
the
administrator
have
discretion
to
give
effect
to
the
waiver,
or
it
--
must
it
disregard
the
waiver
and
strictly
follow
the
beneficiary
designation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
made
the
contention
now
--
and
i
think
you
have
it
in
your
brief
--
that
if
you
get
something
in
return
for
a
disclaimer,
then
the
disclaimer
is
not
effective.
that
it's
effective
only
if
you
receive
nothing
in
return.
and
what
--
what
is
the
source
of
that
contention
that
you
can't
disclaim
if
you
get
something
in
return?
