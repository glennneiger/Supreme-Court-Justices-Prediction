i'm
not
sure
i'm
getting
this
argument.
there's
not
--
the
argument
isn't
that
there
was
a
qdro;
the
argument
was
that
he
could
have
disposed
of
this
through
a
qdro.
and
he
could
have
done
that,
and
he
could
have
named
an
alternate
payee
in
the
qdro.
he
could
have
named
his
daughter,
for
example.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
you're
saying
is
that
you
couldn't
effect
a
bare
waiver
through
a
qdro,
but
why
does
that
prove
your
case?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
a
qdro
could
have
been
used
to
direct
the
payment
to
someone
else
other
than
the
ex-spouse.
