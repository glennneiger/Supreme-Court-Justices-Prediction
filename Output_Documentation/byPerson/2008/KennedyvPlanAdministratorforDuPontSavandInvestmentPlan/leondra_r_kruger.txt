ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fifth
circuit
decided
this
case
on
the
grounds
that
erisa's
anti-alienation
provision
forbids
a
divorcing
spouse
from
relinquishing
an
interest
in
his
or
her
ex-spouse's
pension
plan
benefits
unless
the
waiver
takes
the
form
of
a
qualified
domestic
relations
order.
we
agree
with
petitioner
that
the
fifth
circuit
misinterpreted
both
the
anti-alienation
provision
and
the
qdro
exception
to
that
provision.
but
we
disagree
with
petitioner's
further
submission
that
merely
because
erisa
does
not
forbid
waivers
in
the
divorce
context
or
otherwise,
that
a
plan
administrator
may
be
required
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
to
recognize
such
waivers
even
when
those
waivers
conflict
with
the
beneficiary
designation
the
plan
administrator
has
on
file.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
indeed,
your
honor,
we
think
that
they
are.
the
statute
directs
plan
administrators
to
administer
the
plan
in
accordance
with
the
plan
documents
and
further
requires
administrators
to
pay
benefits
to
persons
who
are
either
participants
under
the
plan
or
who
are
beneficiaries
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
it
need
not
reach
this
point
because
it
decided
the
case
on
different
grounds;
namely,
the
anti-alienation
grounds.
but,
again,
we
think
that
if
the
fifth
circuit
was
incorrect
in
its
reasoning
but
reached
the
correct
overall
conclusion,
then
its
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
for
several
reasons,
your
honor,
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
answer
both
the
plan
documents
question
as
well
as
the
anti-alienation
question.
one
is
that
it
is
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance.
the
other
is
that
it
was
properly
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
raised
in
the
cert
petition
as
well
as
in
the
brief
in
opposition.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
know
of
any
either,
your
honor.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
possible
to
--
to
either
order
for
the
briefing
on
the
issue
or
to
grant
the
question
now
at
this
juncture.
i
think
it
would
also
be
conceivable
to
read
the
question
that
the
court
did
grant
on
as
encompassing
the
federal
common
law--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
your
honor,
that
is
an
important
consideration.
i
do
think
that
in
the
opening
brief
the
petitioners
did
brief
the
question
of
what
effect
is
to
be
given
to
a
waiver
if
indeed
a
waiver
is
not
prohibited
by
the
anti-alienation
clause.
and
that
federal
common
law
rule
that
petitioners
suggest
is
one
that
does,
i
think,
naturally
invite
some
consideration
of
the
conflicting
statutory
directive
in
the
form
of
the
plan
documents
principle
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
its
earlier
cases.
and
certainly
in
its
reply
brief
petitioners
did
address
this
issue
in
full.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
question
of
whether
beneficiary
designation
forms
count
as
plan
documents,
is
a
little
bit
beside
the
point.
the
--
the
plan
documents
in
this
case
do
specify
a
procedure
for
determining
who
is
to
receive
benefits.
it
says
that
benefits
will
be
paid
to
the
designated
beneficiary,
the
person
who
is
designated
by
the
participant.
and
it
says
that
changes
to
those
beneficiary
designations
shall
be
made
in
the
manner
that's
prescribed
by
the
plan.
and
so,
because
the
plan
sets
out
a
procedure
for
changing
beneficiary
designations,
we
think
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
look
beyond
that
to
require
plan
administrators
to
look
to
extrinsic
documents
in
order
to
determine
whether
one
of
them
overrides
that
designation.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
in
this
case
there
is
a
conflict
then
between
the
wishes
of
the
participant,
who
by
all
accounts
would
have
chosen
not
to
change
the
beneficiary
designation,
and
that
of
the
beneficiary.
and
in
that
case
in
order
to
effectuate
the
--
the
interests
of
all
parties
involved
in
order
to
provide
certainty
to
all
parties
in
ascertaining
what
their
rights
are
with
respect
to
the
plan,
then
it
is
incumbent
on
the
plan
administrator
to
abide
by
the
designated
beneficiary.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
again,
your
honor,
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
go
on
to
address
that
question
because
the
issues
have
been
fully
aired
both
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
in
the
briefing
in
this
court.
but
if
the
court
were
inclined
to
--
to
reserve
that
question
for
a
later
time,
i
think
that
would
be
fine
as
well.
and--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--that
is
correct.
there
is
a
circuit
split
on
the
question
as
was
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
and
the
second
and
sixth
circuits
are
the
circuits
that
have
to
date
agreed
with
the
position
that
we
are
espousing
here:
that
the
plan
documents
control
and
preclude
formulation
of
a
federal
common
law
rule
of
the
sort
that
petitioner
proposes.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
there
are
a
number
of
them
including
the
fifth,
the
seventh,
the
third.
the
reason
why
the
plan
documents
rule
is
so
important
in
this
case
is
because
it
serves
important
statutory
interests
in
certainty,
certainty
of
the
parties
as
well
as
certainty
of
the
administrators.
and
it
is
clear;
it
is
easy
to
apply;
it
makes
it
possible
for
administrators
to
do
their
jobs
without
fear
of
further
litigation
in
case
they
happen
to
make
what
a
court
may
later
in
the
proceedings
determine
is
the
wrong
choice.
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
erisa
is
clear,
and
that
it
doesn't
permit
the
kind
of
federal
common
law
rule
that
petitioner
proposes,
which
is
one
that
would
essentially
revise
the
statute
to
override
the
plan
documents
rule
and
would
require
substantial
burdens
on
the
plan
and
would
yield
uncertainty
for
the
parties.
for
that
reason
we
would
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
alternative
grounds
or,
alternatively,
it
should
remand
for
further
proceedings.
