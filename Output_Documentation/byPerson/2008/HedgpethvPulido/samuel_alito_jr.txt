justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
clarify
the
--
the
category
of
cases
that
would
be
affected
if
your
argument
is
accepted?
there
would
be
--
an
error
would
be
--
would
not
be
harmless
under
brecht
if
it
had
a
substantial
or
--
or
injurious
effect,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
what
is
the
standard
under
california
law
for
submitting
a
theory
of
liability
to
the
jury?
presumably,
you
have
to
have
some
evidence
in
support
of
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
are
--
you
are
arguing
that
there
are
instances
in
which,
when
a
theory
of
liability
is
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
error
--
and
it's
erroneous
--
the
error
can
be
harmless.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
correct?
now,
what
are
the
--
what
is
the
standard
under
california
law
for
submitting
the
theory
of
liability
to
the
jury
in
the
first
place?
you
have
to
have
--
presumably,
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
in
support
of
that,
right?
how
much?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
i'm
asking
is:
when
is
there
going
to
be
a
case
in
which
a
theory
of
liability
is
submitted
to
the
jury
and
it's
--
and
it's
erroneous
--
multiple
theories
are
submitted;
one
erroneous.
and
yet
it
would
turn
out
that
the
submission
of
the
erroneous
theory
did
not
have
a
substantial
or
injurious
effect.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
aren't
there
going
to
be
cases
in
which
there's
enough
evidence
to
support
the
submission
of
a
theory
of
liability
to
the
jury,
but
so
little
that
the
court
is
going
to
be
able
to
say
that
it's
harmless
under
--
that
the
submission
of
the
invalid
theory
was
harmless
under
brecht?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
is
difference.
an
element
of
the
offense
has
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
and
it
may
be
that
that
it's
--
the
element
is
undisputed,
but
a
theory
of
liability
isn't
going
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
unless
there
is
some
evidence
to
support
it.
