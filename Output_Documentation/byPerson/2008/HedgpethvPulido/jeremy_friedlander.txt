mr.
jeremy
friedlander
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
has
agreed
with
us
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
when
it
said
that
the
error
here
and
the
one
in
stromberg
were
structural
defects.
the
remaining
question
is
whether
respondent
can
salvage
the
stromberg
rule
by
making
it
part
of
a
proper
harmless
error
test
as
he
attempted
to
do.
his
harmless
error
test
is
wrong
for
several
reasons,
but
the
stromberg
part
of
it
was
wrong
for
basically
one
reason.
he
makes
the
stromberg
rule
into
a
rule
of
harmless
error,
and
it
is
not
even
a
correct
rule
of
error.
this
court
has
defined
"instructional
error"
to
require
not
merely
a
mistake
in
instruction,
but
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
misapplied
the
law.
so
when
respondent
says,
invoking
stromberg,
that
to
instruct
the
jury
on
valid
and
invalid
theories
is
harmless
error
if
the
jury
adopted
a
valid
theory,
what
respondent
is
saying
is
nothing
more
than
that
no
error
occurred
in
the
first
place.
because
the
jury
found
everything
it
needed
to
find
in
order
to
convict
and,
therefore,
did
not
misapply
the
law.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
we
need
to
have
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
misapplied
the
law.
that's
how
we
get
to
error.
respondent
invokes
stromberg
to
say
if
the
jury
is
instructed
a
right
way
and
a
wrong
way
and
they
went
the
right
way,
we
have
harmless
error.
no.
what
we
really
have
is
no
error
at
all.
because
there
is
the
--
the
jury
did
not
misapply
the
law.
moreover,
stromberg
is
not
even
a
correct
rule
of
error.
because
under
stromberg
you
have
error
if
the
jury
could
have
misapplied
the
law.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
yes.
i
agree
that
error
occurred
in
this
case.
what
i'm
trying
to
argue
here
is
that
respondent
is
entirely
off
base
in
importing
the
stromberg
rule
into
a
harmless
error
determination.
stromberg
is,
at
most,
a
rule
of
error.
the
jury
went
the
wrong
way.
that
is
a
rule
of
error,
but
it
is
not
even
a
correct
rule
of
error
because
under
stromberg
you
say,
could
the
jury
have
gone
the
wrong
way;
whereas,
under
this
court's
modern
precedent
you
have
to
have
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--yes.
i
agree
that
there
was
an
error
here
but
not
because
of
stromberg.
because
this
was
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
misapplied
the
law.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
misapplied
the
law.
that's
the
error
question.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
then
the
harmless
error
question
is:
given
that
they
misapplied
the
law,
do
we
know
under
the
requisite
degree
of
certainty
--
chapman
on
direct
review,
brecht
here
--
that
they
would
still
have
found
him
guilty
of
felony
murder
under
a
proper
instruction?
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
the
last
part
of
the
question,
but
i
agree
with
you
if
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
california
supreme
court,
in
effect,
applied
a
stromberg-like
test.
they
said
"necessarily
resolved".
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
their
basis
for
the
conclusion
was
the
jury's
"special
circumstance"
finding.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
now,
they
did
not
consider,
when
they
made
that
"special"
--
when
they
interpreted
that
"special
circumstance",
the
"and/or"
mistake
that
was
embedded
in
the
instructions.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
no,
it
didn't
mean
that.
we
don't
agree
with
that.
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
instruction.
but
let
me
skip
past
that
if
you'll
allow
me.
even
if
you
--
even
if
you
accent
any
meaning
from
that
"special
circumstance"
finding
--
and
we
don't
agree
with
that
but
even
if
you
did
--
you
had
at
a
minimum
here
the
nature--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--well--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--the
basis--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--the
basis
for
the
california
supreme
court--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--i
think
--
i
think
that--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--the
reasoning
behind
the
decision,
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
okay.
but
it
doesn't
matter
because
we
are
going
to
apply
brecht
anyway.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
true.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
i
think
that
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
error
in
the
first
place
in
submitting
a
factually
unsupported
theory.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
yes.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
i
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
it
would
certainly
be
error
under
california
state
law
if
there
is
a
reasonable
--
if
they
have
the
same
reasonable
likelihood
standard
that
the
federal
courts
have,
if
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
misapplied
the
law.
now,
in
a
--
but
you
seem
to
be
focusing
on
an
evidentiary
sufficiency,
and
i
think
that's
governed
by
griffith
where
if
you
--
if
you
have
an
insufficient
--
if
you
have
insufficient
evidence
to
support
the
theory,
then
it's
inappropriate--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--this
one
--
this
case
--
this
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
two
alternative
theories:
one
of
them
correct,
pre-killing
aiding
and
abetting;
one
of
them
incorrect,
post-killing
aiding
and
abetting.
and
it
didn't
have
a
substantial
injurious
effect
because
we
know
that
at
an
absolute
minimum
here
the
jury
found
that
the
defendant
acted
--
aided
and
abetted
robbery
with
reckless
indifference
to
human
life
and
was
a
major
participant
in
the
robbery.
and
those
findings
were
not
compatible
with
post-killing
aiding
and
abetting.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
well,
the
jury
rejected
accessory
after
the
fact
but--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--they
were
instructed
on
accessory
after
the
fact
as
the
lesser
offense
and
they
found
in
essence
robbery
and
felony
murder.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
yes.
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
in
deciding
felony
murder
they
failed
to
decide
that
he
engaged
in
the
robbery
before
the
killing.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
however,
they
went
and
found
the
special
circumstance
in
which
they
found
reckless,
aiding
and
abetting
with
reckless
indifference
to
human
life
and
as
a
major
participant.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
no.
that's
not
correct.
i
don't
believe
that's
correct.
it
is
true
that
part
of
the
instruction,
that
and/or
difficulty,
focused
on
a
different
question,
a
different
point,
said
that
if
you
--
if
they
--
i'm
blanking
out
but--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--it
didn't
address
the
reckless
indifference
to
human
life
and
the
major
participant,
but
that
was
embedded
in
the
instructions,
and
from
the
start
the
courts
that
have
looked
at
this
and
have
reached
this
question
have
all
agreed
that
there
was
a
jury
finding
of
reckless
indifference
to
human
life
and
major
participant,
and
they
have
disagreed
as
to
what
it
might
have
meant.
okay?
now,
the
u.s.
district
court--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--no.
they
came
in
with
a
special
circumstance
finding.
the
special
circumstance
finding
that
this
was--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--no.
the
special--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--the
--
i'll
read
from
ja
14.
this
is
the
special
circumstance
instruction
that
was
--
was
mistaken:
"the
murder
was
committed
while
the
defendant
was
engaged
in
the
commission
or
attempted
commission
of
a
robbery,
or
the
murder
was
committed
in
order
to
carry
out
or
advance
the
commission
of
the
crime
of
robbery,
et
cetera.
"
now,
that
--
that
finding
alone
we
agree
if
you
--
if
you
--
if
you
just
follow
that
finding,
that
doesn't
implicate
the
defendant.
but
you
have
to
read
at
ja
13,
the
instruction,
ja
13:
"the
defendant
with
reckless
indifference
to
human
life
and
as
a
major
participant
aided
and
abetted
in
the
commission
of
a
robbery
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
flores.
"
that's
at
ja
13.
so
there
were
multiple
findings
here.
and
--
and
the
district
court
which
--
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
paragraph
of
ja
13.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
no.
the
--
the
problem
with
the,
i
think
you're
mixing
up
two
things
here.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
the
felony
murder
instructions
did
not
speak
to
this
question
of
contemporaneity.
they
left
it
open.
that
was
error.
we
acknowledge
that
that
was
error.
okay?
so
they
arguably
find
felony
murder,
aiding
and
abetting
felony
murder
based
on
post-killing
aiding
and
abetting.
now,
the
jury
has
to
get
to
the
special
circumstance
finding,
right?
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
and
now
it
has
to
decide,
among
other
things,
as
i
--
as
i
read
to
you,
"did
he
aid
and
abet
robbery
with
reckless
indifference
to
human
life
and
as
a
major
participant
in
the
commission
of
a
robbery
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
flores?
"
that's
at
ja
13.
so
what
we--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--it
doesn't.
it
doesn't
say
that.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
yes,
it
does,
and
the
reason
that
it
does
is
because
the
harmless
error
test
is
not
whether
the
jury
actually
made
the
finding
that
it
needed
to
make;
rather,
the
harmless
error
test
is
do
we
know
from
the
evidence
and
from
the
findings
that
the
jury
would
have
made
the
findings
that
it
was
required
to
make
had
it
been
properly
instructed?
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
yes.
i'm
not
arguing
the
first
point.
i
--
i
concede
there
was
error.
i
just
wanted
to
make
the
point
that
stromberg
itself
is
an
incorrect
rule
of
error.
but
i
can
see
that
that's
led
us
down
a
path
that
i
didn't
need
to
go
down.
now,
we
are
certainly
arguing
harmless
error.
as
for
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
we
said
--
the
ninth
circuit
said
this
is
structural
error.
we
don't
even
start
a
harmless
error
analysis.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
no,
it
did
not.
and
--
and
we
said
that's
wrong.
this
is
trial
error,
not
structural
error.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
well,
the
district
court
was
right
to
the
extent
that
it
found
it
to
be
trial
error.
it
was
wrong
to
the
extent
that
it
found
it
to
be
prejudicial
trial
error.
but
respondent
has
agreed
with
us
that
this
is
not
structural
error,
that
we
need
to
do
a
harmless
error
analysis,
and
what
respondent
has
done
is
import
into
this
harmless
error
analysis
we
are
saying
the
stromberg
rule;
and
it
doesn't
belong
there.
the
stromberg
rule
is
not
a
proper
rule
of
harmless
error.
it's
at
most
a
rule
of
error.
i'd
like--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--was
the
rationale
incorrect?
if--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--it's
incorrect
in
the
way
that
you're
thinking
it
is
incorrect,
but
it
was
also
incorrect
in
another
way.
it
was
incorrect
in
a
way
that
it
applied
too
strict
a
standard.
it
said
has
this
question
been
necessarily
been
resolved;
and
it
said
yes,
it
has
been
necessarily
resolved.
well,
that's
not
the
question.
the
harmless
error
question--
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
--that
answer
was
incorrect;
and
as
well
as
what
you're
thinking,
it
was
incorrect,
in
that
they
premised
it
on
a
factual
basis
that
was
not
in
fact
the
case.
but
i
better
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeremy
friedlander
we
agree
that
we
need
to
do
brecht.
we
disagree
on
what
brecht
is.
respondent
is
telling
you
that
brecht
is
the
error
test,
whether
the
jury
relied
on
the
valid
or
invalid
theory.
that's
what
he
says
brecht
is.
in
calderon
v
coleman,
this
court
said
there
is
a
difference
between
the
error
test
and
the
harmless
error
test.
all
these
questions
that
the
jury
asked
went
to
the
question
of
error.
did
the
jury
misapply
the
law
by
failing
to
find
a
contemporaneity
aspect
of
felony
murder?
they
did
not
go
to
the
harmless
error
question
of
what
the
jury
would
have
done
had
it
been
properly
instructed.
we
urge
the
court
in
remanding
the
case
to
make
clear
that
the
error
analysis
must
be
kept
separate
from
the
harmless
error
analysis.
this
is
a
mistake
judge
thomas
made
in
his
concurring
opinion.
we
--
he
assumes
--
he
sees
a
mistake
in
an
instruction;
he
assumes
that
the
mistake
rises
to
the
level
of
constitutional
error;
and
then
he
does
a
prejudice
analysis
by
deciding
whether
the
mistake
caused
the
jury
to
misapply
the
law.
in
other
words,
he
--
he
applies
an
error
analysis
to
decide
prejudice.
and
what
he
does
is
he
includes
all
this
evidence
of
the
questions
the
jury
asked
when
those
questions
went
only
to
the
misapplication
of
law
that
was
the
error,
and
did
nothing
to
show
the
basis
of
the
jury's
special
circumstance
finding,
which
is
the
heart
of
the
harmless
error
determination
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
