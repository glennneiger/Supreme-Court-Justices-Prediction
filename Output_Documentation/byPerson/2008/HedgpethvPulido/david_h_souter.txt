they
found
the
greater
offense,
so
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
them
to
go
to
the
lesser
included
offense.
your
trouble
is
--
and
i
think
the
problem
that
we
are
having
is
that
in
finding
the
greater
offense,
they
may
have
done
so
under
a
theory
of
accomplice
liability
that
was
consistent
with
the
accomplice
simply
coming
in
at
a
late
stage
in
the
proceedings.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
that's
the
difficulty
we
are
having.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
the,
the
difficulty
with
using
that
as
a
means
of
answering
the
first
error
was
that
the
way
the
special
circumstance
instruction
was
phrased,
they
could
have
found
the
special
circumstance
without
finding
anything
more
than
that
he
came
in
at
a
late
stage.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
second
--
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
isn't
--
maybe
i'm
not
getting
it.
help
me
out
here.
one
possibility
under
--
under
the
instruction
at
ja
13
is
"or
assisted
in
the
crime
of
robbery.
"
and
the
other
instructions
because
they
are
erroneous
leave
open
the
possibility
of
finding
that
he
assisted
in
the
crime
of
robbery
only
if
he
came
in
late.
and
that's
why
it
does
not
solve
the
original
error.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
may
be
doing
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
where
does
it
say
that
he
must
have
assisted
prior
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
that
doesn't
cure
the
error.
