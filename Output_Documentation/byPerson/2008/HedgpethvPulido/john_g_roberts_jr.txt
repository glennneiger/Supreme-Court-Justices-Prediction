chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-544,
hedgpeth
versus
pulido.
mr.
friedlander.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
arguing
one
of
two
things:
first,
that
there
was
no
error
at
all
under
stromberg;
or
second,
that
if
there
was
error,
it
was
harmless
error.
and
i
thought
the
case
was
about
whether
or
not
the
ninth
circuit
erred
in
concluding
that
harmless
error
analysis
didn't
apply
to
a
stromberg
error.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
shah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
suppose
it's
not,
in
the
abstract
anyway,
necessarily
true
that
this
case
follows
a
fortiori,
because
here,
at
least
you
have
a
valid
theory.
that
may
make
it
a
harder
case,
because
the
jury
had
based
its
entire
verdict
on
an
invalid
theory.
it
may
be
more
difficult
than
a
situation
where
you've
got
a
theory
of
the
case
that
is
invalid
because
a
particular
element
is
missing.
and
you
can
look
and
see
whether
or
not
that
was
harmless
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess,
though,
the
point
is
when
you
have
invalid
and
valid
theories,
it
would
be
a
little
harder
than
neder,
because
they
don't
have
to
make
any
findings
under
the
valid
theory.
you
know,
because
you
don't
just
have
to
fill
in
a
missing
piece
of
the
puzzle,
as
in
neder.
you
have
to
--
they
might
have
been
working
on
an
entirely
different
puzzle.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
we
are
talking
about,
in
other
words,
is
the
application
of
harmless
error,
which
may
or
may
not
be
harder
in
the
multiple
theory
case,
and
not
the
question
of
whether
harmless
error
analysis
should
be
applied.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
shah.
mr.
o'connell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
error
wasn't
harmless.
and
that's
an
argument
you
can
make
before
the
ninth
circuit
on
remand.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
don't
we
just
take
them
at
their
word?
as
you
say,
they
are
applying
the
wrong
nomenclature.
it
would
be
easy
enough
for
them
when
they
get
it
back
to
say,
oh,
we
meant,
you
know,
harmless
error
under
brecht.
but
that
seems
to
me
to
be
at
least
an
open
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
brecht,
you
have
the
burden
of
showing
a
substantial
injurious
effect.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
you
win
under
brecht?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
think
the
ninth
circuit,
although
it
didn't
use
that
label,
actually
applied
the
brecht
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
well,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
agree
with
your
friend
that
the
brecht
standard
--
and
the
government
--
that
the
brecht
standard
applies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
all
the
fight
is
over
is
whether
the
ninth
circuit
applied
that
standard
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
we
just
send
it
back
and
ask
them?
say:
we
can't
tell.
the
parties
are
having
disagreement
about
whether
you
did.
what
did
you
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
o'connell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
friedlander,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
friedlander.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning
a
brief
per
curiam
opinion
deciding
case
no.
07-544,
hedgepeth
versus
pulido.
micheal
pulido
was
convicted
by
a
california
jury
of
felony
murder.
after
his
conviction
was
upheld
in
a
state
court
system,
pulido
sought
habeas
relief
in
a
federal
district
court.
the
district
court
overturned
the
conviction
after
concluding
that
an
error
in
the
jury
instructions
permitted
the
jury
to
convict
on
two
alternate
theories
of
felony
murder,
only
one
of
which
was
valid
under
california
law.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court’s
holding.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
whether
the
lower
courts
were
correct
in
deciding
that
there
was
an
error
in
the
instructions,
instead,
the
questions
is
what
to
do
about
it.
the
usual
rule
set
forth
in
our
cases
is
that
a
federal
habeas
petitioner
can
only
obtain
relief
for
an
instructional
error,
if
that
error
had
a
“substantial
and
injurious
effect
or
influence
in
determining
the
jury’s
verdict.”
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
however
characterized
the
instructional
error
before
it
as
structural.
if
an
error
is
structural,
a
conviction
must
be
overturned
without
considering
whether
the
error
actually
harmed
the
defendant.
we
conclude
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
to
characterize
the
alternative
theory
instructional
error
as
structural.
there
is
no
basis
for
treating
that
particular
kind
of
instructional
error
differently
for
the
many
other
kinds
that
we
have
held
do
not
result
in
automatically
overturning
a
conviction
but
instead
require
considering
whether
the
error
actually
caused
any
harm.
all
nine
members
of
the
court
agree
with
that
conclusion.
even
pulido
now
does.
his
argument
before
this
court
was
that
although
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
to
use
the
label
structural,
it
in
fact
conducted
the
sort
of
inquiry
into
prejudice
required
by
our
cases.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justices
souter
and
ginsburg
agreeing
with
that
contention.
the
rest
of
us
do
not
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
considered
whether
the
instructional
error
had
a
substantial
and
injurious
effect
as
it
should
have
and
accordingly
we
remand
the
case
for
consideration
of
that
question.
the
judgment
of
the
court
appeals
is
vacated,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
