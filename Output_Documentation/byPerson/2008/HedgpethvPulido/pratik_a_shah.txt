mr.
pratik
a.
shah
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
chief
justice
framed
the
main
issue
in
this
case
properly.
consistent
with
the
last
two
decades
of
this
court's
instructional
error
jurisprudence,
the
court
should
hold
that
the
type
of
error
at
issue
is
not
structural
and
is
subject
to
harmless
error
review.
the
ninth
circuit's
contrary
interpretation
of
stromberg
creates
the
untenable
result
that
adding
an
invalid
theory
--
adding
a
valid
theory
to
an
invalid
one
somehow
makes
the
error
worse.
even
respondent
now
rejects
that
interpretation.
it
follows
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
ninth
circuit
and
remand
for
application
of
harmless
error
review
under
brecht.
the
main
issue--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--yes,
your
honor.
the
district
court
did
apply
harmless
error
review
under
brecht.
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
did
not.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
this
court
could
do
that,
but
the
longstanding
and
customary
practice
of
this
court
is
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
address
the
harmless
error
question,
that
it
remands
to
that
court.
it
did
that
in
rose
v.
clark,
in
pope
v.
illinois
and
california
v.
roy,
and
more
recently
in
recuenco.
and
in
several
of
those
cases
the
intermediate
court
or
the
district
court,
in
the
habeas
context,
did
address
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
in
all
of
those
cases
that
the
court
did
remand
for
application
of
harmless
error.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
would
add
that
this
court
should
also
clarify
the
scope
of
that
harmless
error
inquiry.
i
think
there
are
two
important
principles.
there
is
no
logical
reason
to
apply
a
narrower
form
of
harmless
error
review
in
this
case
than
the
court
did
in
neder.
so
i
think
that
this
court
should
clarify
that
the
principles
of
harmlessness
articulated
in
neder
should
apply
on
remand
to
the
ninth
circuit.
i
think
those
of
those
principles
bear
mention.
first,
the
question
is
not
what
the
jury
actually
or
necessarily
found,
but
rather,
it
encompasses
what
a
rationale
jury
would
have
found
absent
the
error.
and
i
think
the
second
important
point
for
this
court
to
clarify
is
that
harmlessness
review
is
not
limited
to
cases,
is
not
limited
to
cases
where
the
relevant
elements
are
undisputed,
but
rather
even
when
disputed,
a
reviewing
court
should
consider
the
entire
record
and
determine
whether,
in
light
of
the
jury
finding,
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
contrary
verdict.
and
then
it
should
remand,
your
honor,
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
apply
those
principles.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
we
do--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
we
think
it's
important
because
there
are
certain
jury
findings
that
we
know
the
jury
made
in
this
case.
the
jury
returned
a
special
circumstance
verdict.
and
we
know
based
upon
that
verdict
that
at
a
minimum,
the
jury
found
that
respondent
was
a
major
participant
in
the
crime
--
just
taking
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
respondent
was
a
major
participant
in
the
robbery,
that
he
exhibited
a
reckless
disregard
for
human
life.
and
we
also
know
that
the
jury
rejected
a
duress
defense.
the
jury
was
instructed
on
that
defense,
and
yet
the
jury
came
back
guilty.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
--
that
the
inquiry
should
take
place
in
a
vacuum,
but,
of
course,
the
reviewing
court
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
limited
jury
findings
that
we
do
know
were
made,
and
then
apply
the
sufficiency
inquiry
in
light
of
those
jury
findings.
there
is
no
reason
to
disregard
the
jury
findings
that
were
made.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
would
disagree,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
there
are
two
possibilities
in
a
case
with
alternative
theories.
one
possibility
is
that
the
jury
relies
upon
the
defective
instruction.
for
example,
there
is
one
element
omitted
just
like
the
instruction
in
neder.
if
that's
what
the
jury
had
done,
then
this
case
is
no
different
than
neder,
no
better,
no
worse,
right.
the
other
possibility,
however,
is
that
the
jury
relies
on
the
completely
valid
theory.
if
the
jury
relied
on
the
completely
valid
theory,
then
there
is
even
less
of
a
problem
than
neder.
there
is
no
problem
at
all.
so
i
don't
see
how
the
error
in
this
alternative
valid
theory
and
defective
theory
circumstance
could
be
any--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
you
don't
--
you
don't,
your
honor.
and
that's
what
the
reviewing
court
has
to
decide.
but
in
either
scenario,
if
it
--
if
you
assume
that
the
jury
relied
on
the
defective
theory,
then
we
are
in
the
same
box
as
in
neder,
and
the
reviewing
court
would
decide
whether
there
was
--
you
know,
they
would
apply
the
harmless
error
review
to
the
missing
element
and
decide
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
render
that
error
harmless;
or
the
court
could
ask,
well,
is
that
uncontraverted
or
overwhelming
evidence
that
the
defendant
would
have
been
found
guilty
under
the
valid
theory.
and
that
would
also
be
a
permissible
inquiry.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
in
almost
all
conceivable
cases
there
is
going
to
be
at
least
some
overlap
between
--
between
the
two
theories.
and
what
the
--
the
reason
why
that's
relevant
is
because
you
know
that
when
the
jury
has
returned
a
general
verdict
of
guilt,
they
have
necessarily
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
each
of
those
elements
has
been
satisfied.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
here's
why--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
here's
why
i
think
the
cases
aren't
that
different,
because,
you
know,
at
a
minimum
from
the
general
verdict
of
guilt
if
you
take
a
case
like
this,
you
know
that
the
jury
found
that
there
was
an
unlawful
killing.
you
know
that
the
jury
found
that
there
was
a
robbery.
you
know
that
the
jury
found
that
respondent
was
involved
in
the
robbery.
the
only
element
that
we
don't
know--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--it
is
possible
that
the
jury
would
have
found
that,
and
that's
the
question
that
the
reviewing
court
would
perform
in
harmless
error
review,
just
like
if
there
--
basically
that
is
the
exact
same
question
the
court
would
form,
would
do
under
neder
if
the
timing
element
were
omitted
all
together.
the
reviewing
court
would
look
at
the
evidence
and
decide
is
there
sufficient
evidence
to
support
an
after-the-fact
participation.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes,
your
honor.
that's
going
to
be
completely
fact
dependent
whether
it's
harder
or
not.
but
i
think
analytically
it's
exactly
the
same
as
in
neder.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes.
i
mean,
you
can
image
in
a
case
--
take
neder.
by
this
neder
instruction,
the
one
omitting
the
materiality
element,
was
submitted
to
the
jury
certainly
enough
evidence
to
support
it,
and
then
there
was
another
valid
theory--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
if
--
if
there
is
some
evidence
to
support
it,
if
we
were
in
a
direct
review
context,
that's
the
inquiry
that
neder
says.
so
on
a
clean
slate
it
might
be
that
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
contrary
verdict,
that
that
would
end
the
inquiry.
but
in
many
of
these
cases
we
are
going
to
know
that
the
jury
has
made
at
least
some
findings,
has
found
some
of
the
elements.
and
that
might
inform
the
harmless
error
inquiry,
just
like
in
this
as
we
know
that
the
jury
has
found
things
like
a
respondent
was
a
major
participant,
exhibited
a
reckless
disregard
for
human
life,
discounted
a
significant
portion
of
this
--
of
his
statement
by
rejecting
the
duress
defense.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor.
