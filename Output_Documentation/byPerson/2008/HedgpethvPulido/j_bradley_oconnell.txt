mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
unlike
the
sarausad
case
argued
earlier
this
morning,
this
is
a
case
of
conceded
constitutional
error
under
the
reasonable
likelihood
standard,
the
same
question
that
consumed
so
much
of
the
sarausad
argument.
we
acknowledge
that
this
is
a
trial
error
and
is
subject
to
the
brecht
prejudice
standard.
and
as
i
believe
justice
souter
commented
during
the
sarausad
argument,
in
a
brecht
situation,
the
defendant
wins
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
that
is
a
lesson
of
this
court's
decision.
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
yes.
you
wrote
on
o'neal,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
your
honor,
although
the
ninth
circuit
admittedly
used
a
structural
defect
nomenclature
with
which
we
don't
agree,
we
believe
that
the
court
can't
--
that
upon
considering
both
the
ninth
circuit
decision
and
the
district
court
decision,
this
court
can
affirm
because
the
inquiry
which
the
ninth
circuit
did
conduct
was
actually
a
case-specific
inquiry,
not
really
a
structural
defect
inquiry,
and
when
an
examination
of
the
evidence
and
the
verdicts
and
the
instructions
and
anything
else
indicative
of
the
jury's
thinking
still
leaves
the
court
uncertain
whether
the
jurors
relied
on
the
valid
or
the
invalid
theory,
that's
a
substantial
and
injurious
influence.
that
is
grave
doubt.
that
is
equipoise,
in
the
language
of
your
honor's
opinion.
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
in
the
underlying
trial
reporter's
transcript
at
pages
1015
to
1016,
the
district
attorney's
cross-examination
of
mr.
pulido.
the
district
attorney
developed
the
theme
quite
effectively
that,
even
under
mr.
pulido's
own
account,
he
exhibited
reckless
indifference
because
he
saw
the
mortally
wounded
victim
lying
there,
and
the
d.a.
said,
did
you
try
to
resuscitate
him?
have
you
ever
had
a
cpr
class?
i
did
once.
well,
did
you
do
cpr
on
him?
no.
did
you
call
9-11?
you
didn't
care
whether
he
lived
or
died,
did
you?
so
this
entire
line
of
cross-examination,
to
which
the
district
attorney
came
back
again,
though
somewhat
less
dramatically,
at
1330
of
the
transcript
and
again
at
1337
to
1338,
commenting
that
he
--
that
mr.
pulido
did
not
go
back
in
at
some
later
point
to
check
on
the
victim's
condition,
that
entire
line
of
cross-examination
encouraged
the
theme
that
even
under
mr.
pulido's
own
account
of
the
facts,
he
showed
reckless
indifference.
and--
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
--that
certainly
is
an
argument
that
if
the
court
--
if
the
court
is
convinced
that
the
ninth
circuit's
analysis
in
substance
--
because
i
realize
the
nomenclature
--
the
nomenclature
was
inconsistent
with
harmless
error,
and
i'm
not
going
to
defend
that.
if
the
court
is
convinced
that
the
substance
of
the
ninth
circuit's
analysis
was
so
far
removed
from
what
harmless
error
analysis
requires
in
this
context,
we
agree
that
the
usual
course
would
be
to
send
it
back.
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
your
honor,
i
think
i
could
best
answer
that
by
offering
my
own
critique
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
and
--
which
may
explain
why
it
may
be
unnecessary.
in
my
opinion,
what
the
analysis
that
the
ninth
circuit
conducted
was
equivalent
to
a
sufficient
analysis,
equivalent
to
the
point
of
equipoise
discussed
in
o'neal.
that
is
to
say,
it
reviewed
the
evidence
and
said
--
and
the
verdicts
and
the
instructions
--
and
said
we're
uncertain,
we
can't
tell
which
way
the
jury
went.
my
critique
of
the
ninth
circuit's
--
at
least
its
per
curiam
opinion,
as
opposed
to
one
of
the
concurring
opinions,
is
that
in
fact
this
is
not
just
a
general
verdict
case.
we
know
a
great
deal
about
the
jurors'
thinking
in
this
case.
we
know
that
by
a
vote
of
either
8-4
or
4-8,
the
jurors
rejected
the
prosecution's
primary
theory,
which
was
that
pulido
personally
shot
the
victim
and
that,
in
the
prosecutor's
words,
aragon
had
nothing
to
do
with
this,
aragon
wasn't
there,
aragon
isn't
a
murderer.
we
also
know
--
and
this
will
be
another
echo
of
the
sarausad
case
--
we
also
know
that
throughout
their
five
days
of
deliberations,
the
jurors
submitted
question
after
question
directed
to
what
are
now
--
what
are
concededly
defective
erroneous
instructions,
and
moreover,
those
questions
focused
right
in
on
the
defect
in
the
instructions
and
in
particular
the
timing
of
mr.
pulido's
assistance.
and
i
refer
the
court
in
particular
to
the
jurors'
handwritten
diagrams
of
alternative
conceptions
of
felony-murder
aiding
and
abetting
liability,
which
are
at
36
to
38
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
also
the
jurors'
question
at
page
41
of
the
joint
appendix
whether
--
this
goes
right
--
this
goes,
as
the
district
court
said,
to
the
crux
of
the
issue:
does
the
defendant
have
to
have
knowledge
before
or
during
the
crime
of
the
--
of
the
unlawful
purpose
of
the
perpetrator?
and
as
to
both
of
those
questions
the
judge
said:
go
back
and
reread
those
same
instructions,
which
of
course
were
erroneous.
so
my
critique
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
which
is
again
slightly
different,
i
think,
than
the
state's,
would
be
that
it
neglected
to
mention
that
compelling
evidence
that
in
fact
the
jurors
actually
found
a
set
of
facts
corresponding
to
the
invalid
late
joiner
theory,
because
in
my
view
what
--
the
analysis
the
ninth
circuit
conducted
gets
us
to
a
point
of
equipoise,
and
that's
enough
for
brecht.
the
defect
in
the
ninth
circuit's
analysis
is
they
neglected
to
also
factor
in
those
juror
queries,
and
in
my
view
the
juror
queries
move
us
from
a
state
of
equipoise
to
a
very
high
probability
that
the
jurors
relied
on
the
--
and
adopted
a
factual
scenario
corresponding
to
an
invalid
theory.
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
well,
actually,
your
honor,
as
understand
o'neal
the
court
specifically
renounced
describing
it
as
a
burden,
and
in
fact
said
that
we
are
not
going
to
use
the
"burden"
terminology,
and
rather
than
talk
about
allocating
burdens,
we
are
going
to
address
it
from
the
perspective
of
the
judge
and
say,
if
the
judge
is
in
equipoise,
that
is
sufficient.
we
also
know
that
--
drawing
upon
the
relationship
between
the
brecht
standard
and
others,
we
know
that
a
strickland
standard
is
deemed
to
--
that
if
you
have
strickland
prejudice,
you
don't
have
to
go
through
a
separate
brecht
analysis.
because
of
strickland,
reasonable
probability
also
satisfies
brecht's
substantial
and
injurious
influence.
well,
this
court
has
said
again
and
again,
in
construing
strickland,
it
does
not
require
a
more
likely
than
not
showing;
it
simply
requires
a
showing
sufficient
to
undermine
confidence
in
the
outcome.
and--
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
--i
think
we
will
under
brecht,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
in
substance,
it
did
even
though,
as
i
said,
i
will
--
i
can't
--
i
can't
run
from
the
language
the
ninth
circuit
actually
used.
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
yes,
your
honor,
whether
it
applied
it
in
substance.
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
your
honor,
as
i
said
a
little
earlier,
if
i
fail
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
substance
of
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
--
effectively
satisfied
brecht
as
interpreted
in
o'neal,
then
i
agree
that's
an
appropriate
course,
and
we
indicated
that
in
the
final
section
of
our
brief.
there
is
not--
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
--i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
your
honor
--
and,
again,
i
don't
--
i
don't
strenuously
object
to
that
because,
as
i've
mentioned
if
the
court,
if
the
court
remains,
remains
of
the
view
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
simply
incompatible
with
brecht,
then
i
agree
it
should
be
sent
back
and
i
--
and
i
understand
why
that
might
be
the
court's
inclination.
let
me
offer
another
angle
for
why
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
is
entirely
compatible
with
brecht.
in
civil
cases,
this
court
routinely
applies
the
same
sort
of
general
verdict
analysis
which
in
criminal
cases
has
become
to
be
known
as
the
stromberg
line.
in
fact,
it
did
it
as
recently
this
summer
in
the
exxon
valdez
case.
now
civil
cases
don't
have
chapman,
they
don't
have
structural
defect;
civil
cases
are
subject
to
a
harmless
error
standard
which
ultimately
goes
back
to
the
identical
statute
which
was
construed
in
kotteakos.
and
going
back
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
o'neal,
in
addressing
the
relationship
between
kotteakos/brecht
harmless
error
review
and
civil
harmless
error
review,
the
court
indicated
he
think
rather
strongly
that
those
standards
are
either
equivalent
or
to
the
extent
that
they
differ,
the
brecht/kotteakos
standard
is
less
forgiving
of
error
because
of
the
liberty
interest
at
stake.
now
that
means
two
things.
from
a
retrospective
point
of
view
of
simply
construing
this
court's
different
lines
of
cases,
i
think
it
demonstrates
that
this
general
verdict
analysis
is
entirely
consistent
with
a
kotteakos
type
harmless
error
analysis,
but
it
also
has
some
perspective
implications,
because
if
this
court
were
to
wholly
disavow
that
type
of
analysis
and
say
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
harmless
error
review,
that's
going
to
impact
civil
cases,
too;
and
obviously
in
all
this
court's
opinions,
the
court
is
considering
not
only
the
immediate
case,
but
what
is
going
to
happen
if
we
--
if
we
rule
one
way
or
another.
so
this
case
--
this
case
supports
a
finding
of
prejudice
under
that
o'neal
equipoise
and
as
for
the
ninth
circuit
did,
that's
not
what
it
called
it,
it
even
more
strongly
supports
prejudice
when
one
factors
in
the
rest
of
the
record,
notably
the
juror
--
the
juror
queries
and
another
item
which
i
think
may
be
responsive
to
some
of
justice
alito's
earlier
questions,
which
is
the
strength
of
the
evidence
on
the
various
theories.
there
were
three
theories
and
obviously
there
was
evidence
in
support
of
the
prosecution's
main
theory
that
pulido
shot
the
victim
himself.
there
was
evidence
--
obviously
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
the
form
of
pulido's
own
testimony
in
support
of
the
invalid
late-joiner
theory.
out
of
these
the
one
theory
that
had
least
support
in
the
record
before
the
jury
was
the
valid
aiding
and
abetting
theory,
because
no
witness
testified
to
a
scenario
in
which
pulido
assisted
in
some
fashion
or
another
prior
to
the
shooting;
nor
did
the
prosecutor
attempt
to
develop
that
type
of
scenario
in
argument
because
the
prosecutor
was
very
clear:
prosecutor
said
you're
going
to
get
aiding
and
abetting
instructions
just
in
case.
they
only
apply
--
if
--
they
only
come
into
play
if
you
were
to
believe
the
defendant's
story
which
was
a
real
whopper;
but
if
you
believe
the
defendant's
story
the
felony
murder
rule
applies.
but
then
the
prosecutor
immediately
went
back,
"but
i
don't
think
it
applies
at
all,
aragon
wasn't
there.
"
"aragon
didn't
do
it.
"
"pulido
did
it.
"
and
prosecutor
went
back
to
his
primary
theory.
so
the
theory
which
the
--
present
in
the
instructions
was
least
before
the
jury,
was
the
valid
aiding
and
abetting
theory,
yet
defining
this
conceded
error
harmless
depends
on
the
notion
either
that
the
jury
actually
adopted
a
pre-shooting
aiding
or
abetting
or
that
they
necessarily
would
have
adopted
one
if
properly
instructed.
there
is
one
final
point
i'd
like
to
make,
which
is
there
is
a
qualitative
aspect
to
brecht;
and
when
one
has
an
error
under
which
the
defense
testimony
even
if
believed
renders
the
defendant
guilty
erroneously,
that
derails
the
entire
defense.
that
it
seems
to
me
is
the
quintessential
substantial
and
injurious
influence;
because
it
practically
renders
the
trial
nullity
by
erroneously
telling
the
jury
even
if
you
find
this
set
of
facts,
the
defendant
is
guilty.
so
for
these
reasons
and
additionally
for
the
very
thorough
prejudice
analysis
found
in
the
district
court
opinion,
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm,
despite
the
ninth
circuit's
inapt
nomenclature,
but
in
the
event
the
court
is
dissatisfied
with
that
explanation,
we
have
acknowledged
that
the
appropriate
course
in
that
instance
would
be
to
send
it
back
under
brecht.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i'm
prepared
to
submit.
mr.
j.
bradley
o'connell
thank
you,
your
honor.
