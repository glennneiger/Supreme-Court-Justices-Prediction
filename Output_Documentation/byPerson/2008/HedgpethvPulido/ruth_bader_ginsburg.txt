justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there
was
--
that
there
was
this
--
there
were
three
possibilities,
and
one
was
that
the
defendant
didn't
do
anything
before,
didn't
do
anything
during,
but
was
simply
an
accessory
after
the
fact.
if
the
jury
believed
that,
then
there
was
no
way
it
could
convict
him
of
the
crime
that
he
was
convicted
of.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
we
know
that?
was
there
a
special
verdict?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
we
--
in
this
--
how
do
we
know
what
the
jury
found?
they
just
came
in
with
a
guilty
verdict;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
district
court
didn't
say
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
we
were
to
say,
ninth
circuit,
you
were
wrong,
but
the
district
court
was
right--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
the
district
judge
did,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
could
just
review
the
district
court's
decision
using
the
standards
that
the
district
court
used?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
wasn't
questioning
that.
the
issue,
is
the
united
states
position
say
structural
error
was
wrong,
harmless
error
was
right,
and
then
just
have
the
ninth
circuit
review
the
district
court's
decision
that
held
that
there
was
harmless
error
the
way
it
would
ordinarily
review
a
district
court
decision?
