but
you
should
have
said
"no"
to
the
question,
i
think.
because
i
thought
the
question
--
whatever
it
was,
you
are
saying
that
there
isn't
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
its
error
influenced
the
outcome.
you
are
not
saying
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
that.
and
my
question
is
going
to
be
--
at
some
point,
both
of
you
seem
to
agree
with
that
so
--
pretty
much,
it's
a
harmless
error
standard
of
review.
i
think
a
wrote
a
case
on
that,
which
says
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right.
so
why
don't
we
just
send
it
back
and
say
apply
the
standard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
that
i
should
have
grave
doubt
myself
and
any
judge
would
have
to.
he
made
an
argument
here
i
think
that
wasn't
such
a
bad
one.
he
said
look
at
page
14
and
you'll
see
the
mistake,
you
know,
in
the
joint
appendix.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
it
is.
and
it's
absolutely
wrong.
the
basic
instruction
under
the
law
says
you
have
to
be
engaged
in
the
crime
and
you
have
to
have
a
certain
state
of
intent.
you
have
to
have
committed
this
murder
in
order
to
help
the
crime
or
at
least
in
order
to
escape.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
wrong.
put
them
together,
but
then
look
at
the
instruction
on
page
13,
which
he
actually
gave,
and
the
one
on
13
really
does
seem
to
say
that,
or
more
so.
it
says,
you
can
only
apply
--
jury,
you
can
only
apply
this
special
instruction
if
two
things
are
true:
first,
in
lines
9
through
12
of
that
instruction,
it
seems
to
repeat
that
you
have
to
be
engaged
in
the
crime.
and
then
just
before
that,
it
says,
and
you
have
to
have
one
of
two
states
of
mind.
you
have
to
either
intend
to
kill
the
person
or
at
least
be
recklessly
indifferent.
and
since
that's
what
we
said
on
page
13,
the
fact
we
made
a
mistake
on
page
14
doesn't
matter
that
much.
that's
one
of
his
arguments
that
i'm
sure
they
have
a
lot
of
evidentiary
ones
and
a
bunch
of
other
ones.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sure
that
would
be
--
i
mean,
what
worries
me
is
proliferating
arguments
among
judges.
why
not
just
say,
you
know,
apply
brecht.
i'd
like
it
with
the
o'neal
clause
because
it
seems
to
me
the
o'neal
clause
applies.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
go
do
it.
and
then
they
can
say
"we
already
did
it",
or
they
can
say
"we
didn't
already
do
it,
but
we'll
do
it
now.
"
let
them
say
what
they
want
to
say.
