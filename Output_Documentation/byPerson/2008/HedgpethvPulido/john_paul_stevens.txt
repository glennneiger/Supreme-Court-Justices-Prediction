justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
interrupt
you?
you
are
saying
no
error
occurred,
and
on
page
11
of
your
brief
you
say,
"an
unconstitutional
instructional
error
occurred
in
this
case
because
there
was
a
reasonable
likelihood
the
jury
found.
"
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
said
that's
what
happened
here.
that's
what
your
brief
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
that
the
california
supreme
court
gave
an
incorrect
explanation
to
the
answer
to
that
question?
they
said
there
was
no
harmless
error
because
the
--
the
jury
made
a
specific
finding
that
rebutted
that,
and
that
finding
depended
on
the
difference
between
the
word
"and"
and
"or".
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i'm
--
i'm
questioning
the
basis
for
the
supreme
court's
conclusion
that
the
error
was
harmless.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
meant
that
the
jury
really
hadn't
answered
the
question
they
thought
it
had
answered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
do
that,
you
are
removing
the
basis
for
the
california
supreme
court's
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
not
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
the
basis--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
basis--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--for
the
decision
was
a
--
was
a
specific
finding--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
special
circumstance
finding
the
one
that
had
the
word
"or"
in
it,
and
therefore
allowed
the
jury
to
give
a
postkilling
interpretation
of
the
event.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
that
was
what
the
california
supreme
court
relied
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
not
agree
that
the
harmless
error
--
the
--
the
rationale
of
the
california
supreme
court
was
incorrect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
harmless
error
analysis.
actually,
i'm
agreeing
with
you
that
there
should
have
been
harmless
error.
did
it
perform
the
proper--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
--
answer
was
incorrect,
too,
wasn't
it?
and
that
answer
was
incorrect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
difference
is
when
you
only
got
one
theory,
you
know
what
he
relied
on.
when
you
got
alternatives,
how
do
you
know
which
one
he
relied
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
but
in
this
case
the
question
is
whether
the
uncle
did
it
or
the
nephew
did
it.
and
if
there
is
a
lot
of
doubt
about
--
about
--
if
there
is
substantial
reason
to
believe
maybe
it
was
the
uncle,
they
might
have
taken
the
easy
case
out.
i
think
this
is
vastly
different
from
a
single
theory
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it's
an
--
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
that
he
might
have
been
guilty
after
the
fact.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
but
there
is
doubt
about
the
former.
justice
john
paul
stevens
perhaps
after
--
after
the
death
occurred.
that's
all
we
really
know.
