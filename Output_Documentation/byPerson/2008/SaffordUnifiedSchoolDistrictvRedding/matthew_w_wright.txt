mr.
matthew
w.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
search
of
savana
redding
in
this
case
was
constitutional
because
mr.
wilson
had
reason
to
suspect
that
she
possessed
contraband
which
posed
a
health
and
safety
risk.
therefore,
searching
any
place
where
she
might
be
reasonably
hiding
that
contraband
was
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
long
as
he
had
reason
to
suspect,
which
we
believe
the
evidence
does
show,
he
was
entitled
to
search
any
place
where
the
contraband
might
be
reasonably
hidden.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
no,
your
honor.
i'm
--
i'm
suggesting
that
where
it
might
be
reasonably
hidden
is
based
on
an
administrator's
experience
and
certainly
is
proven
out
by
the
reported
cases
that
we've
cite
in
the
reply
on
pages
8
and
9,
which
are
that
students
often
will
secrete
items
in
and
under
their
clothing.
that
is
not
an
uncommon
thing
to
happen,
although
these
kind
of
intrusive
searches
are
rare.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
the
principle
is,
your
honor,
is
that
the
common
experience
with
schoolchildren,
as
--
as
school
officials
have
a
relation
to
schoolchildren,
is
such
that
they
might
hide
things,
and
they
do
hide
things,
in
and
under
their
clothing.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
but--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--your
honor,
i
don't
know,
and
that's
not
in
the
record,
but
i
can
tell
that
you
that
that
would
not
be
the
threshold
requirement
under
this
court's
prior
rulings
to
justify
the
search.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
yes,
your
honor.
to
be
more
specific,
in
the
nationwide
school
experience,
based
on
the
reported
cases
that
we
see,
which
are
contained
in
the
reply
at
pages
8
and
9,
we
find
that
they
hide
them
in
and
under
clothing,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
case
of
which
i'm
aware
where
there
would
be
items
secreted
in
body
cavities.
and
i
--
and
i
feel,
your
honor,
that
that
is
a
bright-line
area
because
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
something
that
the
court
can
clearly
say
is
off
limits.
and--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
for
the
very
same
reasons
this
court
noted
in
t.l.o.
25
years
ago,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
the
school
officials
have
deemed,
in
their
judgment,
that
this
is
an
important
rule
with
regard
to
health
and
safety.
so--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--well,
your
honor,
if
--
if
an
administrator
in
their
judgment,
in
their
reasonable
judgment,
believes
that
any
--
any
drug
poses
a
potential
health
and
safety
risk,
because
they
have
the
custodial
and
tutelary
responsibilities
for
those
kids
--
and
it's
not
like
a
criminal
issue
where
they're
trying
to
prosecute;
this
is
a
case
where
they're
trying
to
protect
--
because
they
have
those
kinds
of
obligations
to
provide
for
the
safety
of
children,
to
provide
an
orderly
educational
environment,
it
is
best
for
this
court
to
defer
to
their
judgment
when
they
believe
that
certain
rules
are
important
and
not
second-guess
those
rules.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
so
long--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
on
a
prescription
medication
that--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--that
a
student
brought
to
school
and
that
a
student
ingested,
another
student
ingested,
and
then
was
airlifted
out
in
an
icu
in
a
near-fatal
experience.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
but
just
7
days--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--i
don't
know,
your
honor,
and
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
again,
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
it
was
a
prescription
drug.
and
--
and
7
days
before
this
event,
your
honor,
just
7
days
before,
the
student
informant
romero
had
taken
a
prescription
drug.
again,
i
don't
know
what
the
type
of
drug
was,
but
he
became
violently
ill,
which
caused
he
and
his
mother
to
come
talk
to
the
administrator.
so
we
had
those
two
recent
events.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
her
friend
marissa
glines,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
where
--
the
question,
where
did
this
pill
come
from,
was
asked
by
the
administrator.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
no,
but
that's
clear
from
the
record,
your
honor.
the
reason
for
that
is
jordan
romero
said
to
mr.
wilson
that
morning:
i
just
received
this
pill
from
marissa
glines.
the
plan
is
that
a
group
of
these
kids
are
going
to
take
these
pills
at
noon.
so
it's
contemporaneous.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
but
the
tip
from
the
young
man
goes
to
glines,
and
the
young
man's
tip
becomes
reliable
when
glines
produces
the
fistful
of
pills
that
he
said
she
would
have,
plus
other
pills.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
but,
your
honor,
then
it
ties
in
with
the
--
with
the
contraband
--
excuse
me
--
the
planner
that
was
laid
open
before
mr.
wilson
when
he
subsequently
searches
savana
redding,
and
she
admits
to
him
that
that
was
her
planner,
but
she
denies
any
knowledge
of
the
contents.
so
did
marissa
glines.
so--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--not--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--not
comprehensively,
your
honor.
what
they
knew
was
there
was
ibu
400s
in
an
otc
pill
that
was
later
identified.
but
he
also
knew
there
was
a
variety
of
pills.
what
mr.
wilson
did
not
know--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--because
he--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--called
poison
control.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
and
--
and
once
that
was
assessed--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--it
was
naprosyn
200
milligrams.
and
--
and,
your
honor,
what
--
that's
a
good
point
because
what
mr.
wilson
doesn't
know
is
what
other
pills
might
be
out
there.
he
knows
there's
a
variety
of
pills,
but
he
doesn't
know
of
what
type.
he
doesn't
know
what
amount.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
precisely,
your
honor.
we
have
argued
that
our
administrators
are
not
pharmacologically
trained.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
it's
in
the
briefs.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
i
don't
have
one
offhand,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
i'm
fairly
--
fairly
certain
it's
in
the
brief.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
precisely.
and
she
called
poison
control
to
figure
that
out,
though,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
the
problem
with
that
is,
your
honor,
it
wouldn't
comport
with
the
notion
that
we
need
to
shield
administrators
from
lawsuits
and
legal
liability.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
whether
or
not
that
would
be
a
factual
determination,
as
to
whether
he
could
reasonably
suspect
that
the
pills
would
be
there?
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
i
think
--
i
think
it
could
lend
itself
to
that,
your
honor,
but
i
would
prefer
that
the
court
--
we
would
ask
the
court
and
it's
our
position
that
the
court
would
lay
down
a
bright
line
rule
such
that
it
wouldn't
end
up
in
a
factual
dispute,
and
that
bright
line
rule
is
this.
once
you
had
reason
to
suspect
a
student
is
possessing
any
contraband
that
poses
a
health
and
safety
risk,
then
searching
any
place
where
that
contraband
may
reasonably
be
found
is
constitutional,
and--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--well,
for
sniffing.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
it's
a
permanent
marker.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
well,
that's
the
--
i
mean,
i'm
a
school
lawyer.
that's
what
kids
do,
unfortunately,
your
honor.
but--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--but
the
point
was
is
that
the
rule
--
the
rule,
your
honor,
is
--
is
grounded
in
the
notion
that
when
there's
a
health
and
safety
risk
because
these
people
are
charged
and
tasked
with
the
responsibility
to
keep
these
kids
safe,
they
have
to
have
the
opportunity
to
act
flexibly,
immediately,
and
effectively
when
they're
dealing
with
these
risks.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
your
honor
seems
to
be
concerned
about
the
reliability
of
the
tip
in
this
case.
your
honor,
i
would
submit
to
you
to
that
student
tips
are
the
very
thing
that
officials
rely
on
probably
the
most.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
there
was
additional
corroborating
evidence,
your
honor.
there
was
--
there
was
suspicion
by
direct
implication
and
there
was
suspicion
by
circumstantial
corroboration.
these
two
kids
could,
in
mr.
wilson's
mind
--
he
believed
that
they
were
working
together
to
conceal
other
types
of
contraband.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
except
that,
your
honor,
there's
a
different
incentive
here.
students
can
be
disciplined
if
they
--
if
they
tell
tales.
and
so
if
she
tells
a
lie
she
faces
the
risk
of
discipline.
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
evidence
that
these
kids
were
friends,
and
he
had
reason
to
rely
on
that.
he
had
reason
based
on
their
association
at
the
opening
dance.
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
because--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--oh,
there
was
no
discipline
that
i
know
of
in
the
record,
your
honor.
it's
not
in
the
record
and
i
do
not
know.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
was
the
person
marissa
glines,
the
person
who
gave
the
tip?
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
no,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
nothing
at
all.
a
bright
line
rule.
i
would
not
allow
it.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
we're
not
even
clinically
trained
to
do
that,
your
honor.
i
would
submit
that
if
a
child
has
something
stuffed
up
one
of
their
cavities
--
and
i
assume
we
mean
private
parts,
the
very
private
parts
--
that
the
first
thing
to
do
would
be
to
send
them
to
the
hospital.
i
mean,
we
just
don't
have
that
clinical
training.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
on
the
legal
basis
i
could
see
that,
your
honor.
i
could
see
that
result.
but
practically--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--i
see
your
concern.
that's
to
be
left
up
to
the
local
governments,
your
honor.
as
you
have
mentioned,
this
court
has
mentioned,
in
ingraham
and
wright--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--technically,
but
it
will
be
controlled
by
the
community.
it
would
be
controlled
by
the
local
board.
the
community
would
never--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--i
just
know
that
there
has
been
concern
expressed
over
body
cavity
searches,
even
in
the
prisoner
environment
and
even
in
the
border
environment.
i
can
say
to
this
court
you
will
not
restrict
or
in
any
way
inhibit
the
discretion
of
an
administrator
by
saying
you
can't
go
there
on
a
body
cavity
search,
nor
would
they
want
to,
nor
are
they
clinically
trained
to.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
that
she
had
not
been
sued.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
your
honor,
that
is
not
a
matter
of
the
record,
but
the
inference
is
that
the
--
that
the
investigation
was
still
ongoing
because
there
was
a
group
of
kids,
and
at
that
time
the
administrator
was
making
efforts
to
try
to
make
sure
that
he
had
gathered
all
the
drugs
that
might
be
on
campus.
and
in
any
event
that
wouldn't--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--well,
your
honor,
i
can
see
where
it
might
have
been
more
reasonable
in
that
sense
to
have
let
her
go
back
to
class,
but
it
certainly
is
not
a
standard
that
would
affect
the
constitutionality.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
yes.
in
fact,
there
was
a
ninth
circuit
on
the
docket
at
the
time,
the
smith
versus
mclaughlin
case,
where
the
plaintiff
argued
the
very
thing,
that
she
was
detained
for
hours.
and
the
court
recognized
there
--
i
believe
there
was
a
concurrence
by
judge
kozinski
--
that
that's
entirely
appropriate,
that's
where
they
are.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
i
believe
it
went
through
the
lunchtime
period,
your
honor,
the
detainment.
in
addition,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
out
also
that
trying
to
restrict
any
more
the
rule
that
i've
laid
out,
as
the
united
states
government
has
suggested,
respectfully,
would
cause
more
problems.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
may
i
offer
two
principles?
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
first,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
least
intrusive
means
is
not
a
threshold
prerequisite
to
a
constitutional--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--very
true.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
in
the
record,
your
honor,
she
did
--
she
did
have
her
underpants
on
and
her
brassiere
still
on.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
no,
your
honor.
you
have
specifically
said
the
fact
that
other
reasonable
alternatives
are
available
doesn't
mean
that
the
alternative
that
was
used
or
the
actual
search
that
was
done
was
unreasonable.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
don't
--
i
can't
answer
that
question
for
mr.
wilson,
but
i'm
sure
that
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
that
that
issue
wasn't
thought
through.
and,
of
course,
he
wasn't
involved
in
the
search
because
he's
a
male.
only
the
females
were
involved
in
the
search.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
well,
it
--
it
is
unreasonable,
and
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it
has
to
be
unreasonable.
to
think
that
--
for
school
officials
to
think
that
this
student
was
hiding
--
this
honor
student
was
hiding
pills
underneath
her
undergarments
based
on
nothing
in
the
record
that
supports
that,
not
a
single
thing.
what
does
the
school
official
know?
that
there
was
an
accusation
that
savana
had
provided
pills
at
an
unknown
time
and
at
an
unknown
location,
that
savana's
backpack
search
yielded
nothing,
not
only
pills,
but
no
suspicion
that
she
possessed
pills
underneath
her
undergarments.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
reality
is
that
we've
gotten
past
the
reasonable
at
its
inception
prong,
and
we're
now
on
the
scope.
and
i
think
everyone
concedes
that.
and,
as
to
the
scope,
i
can
tell
you
that
if
they
found
uncut
heroin
or
small-caliber
bullets
in
this
case,
they
would
have
to
reach
the
same
results.
and
that
is
unacceptable
in
the
school
setting.
there's
too
much
at
risk
here
when
you're
talking
about
the
custodial
and
tutelary
responsibilities
this
court
has
time
and
again
recognized
as
the
most
important
elements
in
upholding
the
three
search
cases,
student
search
cases,
that
this
court
has
upheld.
the
other
thing
about
the
government's
proposal
is
--
is
really
troubling.
it's
because
they
do
not
justify
why
they
would
pass
a
rule
that
would
so
much
stunt
the
administrator's
discretion
to
respond,
even
in
the
most
serious
situations
that
confront
the
health
and
safety
of
kids.
these
--
these
principles
are
principles
that
have
been
restated
by
this
court.
you
need
the
flexibility
to
act
immediately
and
effectively
to
keep
kids
safe.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
that's
right.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
absolutely.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
there
is
an
amicus
brief
that
cites
189
school
districts
which
have
substantially
limited
strip
searches,
which
proves
the
ingraham
v.
wright
theory,
which
is
that
it
will
be
taken
care
of
at
the
local
level.
but
administrators,
for
now,
need
a
bright-line
rule.
and
as
to
the
scope,
that
bright-line
rule
is
if
you
have
reason
to
suspect
that
a
student
is
processing
contraband
that
poses
a
health
and
safety
risk,
then
searching
any
place
where
that
contraband
may
be
reasonably
hidden
is
constitutionally
permissible.
and
in
any
event,
mr.
wilson
in
this
case
certainly
could
have
believed
that
the
constitution
permitted
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
so
immunity
is
a
foregone
conclusion
in
my
opinion.
but
i
would
ask
the
court
to
rule
on
the
constitutional
question
in
the
affirmative
because
it
would
further
the
interests
of
judicial
economy.
there
would
not
be
any
more
federal
action
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
if
you
ruled
in
the
affirmative
on
the
constitutional
question--
mr.
matthew
w.
wright
--the
case
is
over.
the
additional
issue,
justice
alito,
on
the
factual
question
is
i
understand
you're
not
talking
about
immunity,
but
the
reality
is
we've
got
to
be
able
to
make
decisions,
and
if
we
get
sued
on
factual
questions
because
somebody
questions
whether
or
not
it's
reasonable
for
us
to
search
where
contraband
may
be
reasonably
located,
then
we're
going
to
end
up
in
court
anyway
on
those
factual
questions,
which
is
going
to
--
you
know,
deter
officials
from
acting
immediately
and
effectively
in
those
situations.
so,
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
factual
question.
and
the
district
court
and
the
first
three-panel-judge
court
did
hold
as
a
matter
of
law
that
this
search
was
constitutional.
thank
you,
your
honors.
