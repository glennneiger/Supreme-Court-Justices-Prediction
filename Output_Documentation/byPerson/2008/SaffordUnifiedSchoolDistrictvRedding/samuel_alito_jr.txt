justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
mr.
wright,
could
i
ask
you
this
question.
there
may
be
an
issue
as
to
what
the
assistant
principal
could
reasonably
infer
from
the
facts
that
were
known
by
him,
whether
he
could
reasonably
infer
facts
that
would
create
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
there
were
drugs
hidden
in
the
plaintiff's
undergarments.
is
that
a
question
for
--
for
the
finder
of
fact
in
a
case
like
this,
so
that
it
can't
be
--
there
can't
be
summary
judgment
for
either
side
unless
no
reasonable
factfinder
could
find
to
the
contrary?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
not
on
the
question
of
qualified
immunity.
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
school
could
keep
records
on
its
students,
like
the
police
keep
records
on
confidential
informants.
so
if
--
unless
this
student
had
a
proven
record
of
having
accurately
ratted
out
a
certain
number
of
classmates
in
the
past,
she
couldn't
be
believed.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
what
specifically
do
you
think
is
missing
here?
they
need
--
the
school
needed
to
have
a
direct
statement
from
marissa
glines
that
--
that
redding
had
the
--
had
the
pills
in
her
undergarments;
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
have
to
have
direct
evidence
that
the
--
the
--
it
can't
be
based
on
inferences?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
the
distinction
you
are
drawing?
the
location
has
to
be
supported
by
direct
evidence.
somebody
has
to
say
that
that's
where
it
is.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
marissa
glines
had
said
specifically
that
savana
redding
has
pills
someplace
on
her
person
and
she's
going
to
distribute
them
at
lunch
in
the
cafeteria,
would
this
be
a
different
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
difference
between
that
situation
and
this
situation?
the
differences
are
slight.
wouldn't
that
at
least
be
a
question
that
has
to
be
decided
by
the
trier
of
fact?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
mean,
the
student
says,
she
has
--
she
has
crack
someplace
on
her
person,
and
she's
going
to
distribute
it
to
kids
during
the
lunch
hour,
and
so
they
search
her
--
her
garments,
and
they
don't
find
it.
and
you're
saying
that
they
cannot
then
go
ahead
and
search
her
undergarments--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--because--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
to
play
the
devil's
advocate
on
that,
why
couldn't
the
assistant
principal
reason
as
follows:
that
he
has
information
from
--
from
ms.
glines
that
ms.
redding
has
drugs.
he
has
information
from
another
student
that
drugs
are
going
to
be
consumed
during
the
lunch
hour.
putting
those
two
together,
he
reaches
the
--
he
suspects
that
the
person
who
has
the
drugs
has
the
drugs
on
his
or
her
person
so
that
they
can
be
distributed
at
lunch.
and
then
having
searched
every
other
part
of
--
having
searched
ms.
redding's
outer
garments,
what's
left
are
her
undergarments.
so
therefore
there's
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
drugs
are
--
are
located
there.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
a
question
of
law
or
is
that
a
question
that
goes
to
the
trier
of
fact,
whether
you
could
infer
reasonable
suspicion
about
the
presence
of
the
pills
in
those
locations?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
a
1983
action,
wouldn't
it
be
a
jury
question?
