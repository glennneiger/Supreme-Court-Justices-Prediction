mr.
adam
b.
wolf
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
with
the
federal
government
that
before
conducting
an
intrusive
strip
search
a
school
needs
to
have
location-specific
information.
and
while
this
case
can
begin
and
end
with
that
well-accepted
proposition,
it's
also
important
to
recognize
that
a
school
needs
greater
--
a
greater
degree
of
suspicion
to
conduct
a
strip
search
than
to
conduct
an
ordinary
backpack
search.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
your
honor,
i
don't
think
a
head
count
of
the
judges
is
the
standard
by
which
this
court
measures
qualified
immunity.
that's
what
this
court,
you
know,
held,
for
instance,
in
groh
v.
ramirez.
but
i
do
understand
that
it
sort
of
gives
one
pause.
it
says:
well,
what
did
they
miss
here?
and
what
they
missed
here
is
that
this
search
violated
the
clearly
established
point
that
in
order
to
conduct
an
intrusive
search
of
one's
body,
the
searching
official
needs
to
at
least
reasonably
believe
that
the
object
is
located
underneath
the
undergarments.
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
account
--
it
does
not
countenance
the
rummaging
on
or
around
a
13-year-old
girl's
naked
body--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--without
any
suspicion.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
the
nature
of
the
infraction
--
no.
the
nature
of
the
infraction,
as
t.l.o.
would
put
it,
is
a
nonstarter
in
this
case,
because
we
don't
even
have
the
suspicion
to
get
underneath
savana's
undergarments,
even
if
you
had
--
regardless
of
the
substance.
now,
in
t.l.o.,
the
question
was
whether
there
were
drugs
to
be
found.
there
was
marijuana
in
that
case.
and
this
court
set
a
relatively
low
standard,
that
you
need
more
than
a
hunch,
and
you
need
particularized
suspicion.
now,
that's
where
the
court
set
the
balance
for
ordinary
searches
for
drugs.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
no,
it
does
not.
it
does
not
in
this
case,
because
without
a
suspicion
that
you're
going
to
find
the
object--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--your
honor--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--i
think
we
all
understand
that
this
--
that
this
case,
you
know,
involves
ibuprofen.
but
our
argument--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--not
in
in
this
case,
correct.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
i
think
it's
irrelevant
when
you're
making
distinctions
between
drugs.
if
--
if
the
question
is
whether
you
can
strip
search
a
child
for
gum,
for
instance,
because
that
might
prohibit
school
policy,
i
would--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
why?
because
in
this
case
there
was
no
suspicion
--
and
i
think
justice
alito
was
perhaps
getting
to
this
--
there
was
no
suspicion
that
these
objects
were
going
to
be
found
inside
savana's
undergarments.
and
without
that
suspicion
you
cannot
conduct
such
an
intrusive
search.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
justice
alito--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--justice
alito,
i
don't
think
that
accurately
describes
the
record.
even
if
it
did,
it
wouldn't
satisfy
this
court's
standard.
two
things
about
the
record:
one,
i
think
the
hypothetical
supposed
that
she
had
drugs,
and
in
fact
what
the
record
reveals
is
that
it
was
allegedly
savana
provided
these
drugs
at
some
point.
it's
not
that
she
currently
had
them
on
her.
second,
that
they
searched
every
other
part,
and
it's
an
important
--
it's
an
important
point
in
this
case.
where
did
marissa
have
her
planner?
it
was
in
the
desk.
did
they
search
the
desk
here?
no.
we
know
that.
it's
not
in
the
record,
as
mr.
wright
said,
but
they
have
lockers
in
the
school.
did
they
search
any
locker?
can
students
keep
drugs
anywhere
else
on
school
grounds?
perhaps,
probably
so.
did
they
search
everywhere?
they
absolutely
did
not.
but
i
want
to
get
back
to
the
legal
answer,
too,
which
is
that
this
court
said
in
t.l.o.,
and
it's
on
page
342
of
t.l.o.,
that
a
search
is
reasonable
only
when
there
are
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
it
will
turn
up
evidence.
there
were
no
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
this
search
would
turn
up
evidence,
none
at
all.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
i
think
they
could
have
searched
her
backpack.
and
what--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--what
that
speaks
to
is
the
low
degree
of
the
suspicion
and
the
nonspecific
suspicion
that's
needed
to
conduct
an
ordinary
search.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
it's
not
a
sliding
scale,
your
honor.
this
is
a
two-step
framework,
and
that
is
it.
we
have
ordinary
searches,
backpacks,
pencil
cases,
book
bags,
that
kind
of
thing;
and
then
you
have
a
search
where
you
require
a
13-year-old
girl
to
take
off
her
--
take
off
her
pants,
take
off
her
shirt,
move
around
her
bra
so
she
reveals
her
breasts,
and
the
same
thing
with
her
underpants
to
reveal
her
pelvic
area.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
it
is
because
that
is
an
intrusive,
traumatic
search.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
it
--
it
might
be
different
if
they
asked
savana
to
go
into
the
other
room
and
to
change
where
you're
not
revealing
your
body
to
any
government
official.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
right.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
right.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
there
is
none
at
all.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
everybody--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--yes.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
yes.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
yes.
and
it
still
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
and
the
question
is
why.
because
even
that
slightly
less
invasive
search
still
implicates
legitimate
and
serious
implications
of
privacy.
the
national
association
of
social
workers,
for
instance,
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
and
what
they
showed
is
that
--
or
they
cited
studies
showing
that
when
a
child
undergoes
a
strip
search
--
and
justice
breyer,
your
--
your
hypothetical
involves
a
strip
search
--
that
that
produces
long-lasting
and
traumatic
consequences
for
a
13-year-old
child.
now,
why
does
that
matter?
because
the
fourth
amendment
requires
a
balancing.
on
one
side
you
have
legitimate
expectations
of
privacy,
and
on
the
other
side
you
have
the
governmental
need
to
conduct
that
search.
so--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--i
believe
it
is,
your
--
justice
breyer.
and
i
believe
that
we
cite
such
a
study
in
--
in
our
brief,
the
red
brief,
where
we
say
that
it
doesn't
require
a
student
to
take
off
his
or
her
undergarments
so
long
as
the
shirt
and
the
pants
are
taken
off,
that
that
produces
trauma.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
and
to
make
sure
i
understand,
it's
that
there's
reasonable
belief
--
there's
a
reasonable
belief
that
a
student
has
drugs
on
his
or
her
person?
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
and
by
his
or
her
person,
presumably
it
could
be
the
pockets
or
it
could
be
in
the
backpack
that
he
or
she
is
holding?
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
right.
and
in
that
instance
it
still
would
not
be
appropriate.
there
needs
to
be
suspicion
that
the
object
is
located
underneath
the
clothing.
and
if
that
isn't
there,
then
you
can't
search
there.
now
that
should
be--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--well,
i
mean,
to
start,
that's
not
what
t.l.o.
said.
t.l.o.
said
that
there
needs
to
be
a
reasonable--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--because
in
order
to
conduct
that
intrusive
search,
it
seems
like
it
that
case
you
would
have
to
be
doing
guesswork,
if
you
will,
about
where
those
pills
are
located.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
that's
right.
and
presumably,
if
they're
--
if
it
doesn't
show
up
in
a
pocket
search,
then
you
can
do
a
strip
search;
and
if
you
don't
find
it
in
the
strip
search,
you
could
do
a
body
cavity
search;
and
if
it's
not
in
the
body
cavity
search--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--because
--
it
all
comes
back
to
the
balancing
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
here,
where
you're
conducting
a
traumatic
search
without
a
belief
that
you're
going
to
find
it
underneath
the
undergarments,
it--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--no,
it's
not
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
there
are
many
things
that
--
that
this
principal
could
--
or
the
assistant
principal
could
have
done
here
that
would
have
mitigated
any
risk,
and
at
the
same
time
not
caused
the
trauma
of
--
the
trauma
associated
with
a
strip
search.
sit
the
child
down--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--but
--
absolutely.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
well,
the
hypothetical
supposes
they
have
searched
everywhere.
and
i
suppose
if
you
have
--
if
you
are
certain
that
somebody
possesses
a
drug
and
you
have
searched
everywhere,
perhaps
you
have
generated
location-specific
information.
i
would
readily
agree
to
that.
but
in
this
case,
they
certainly
did
not
search
everywhere.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
right.
i
think
if
it
were
readily
known
that
this
student
had
previously
been
suspected
of
--
to
use
the
term
that's
used
in
the
court
of
appeal
cases
--
"crotching"
that
drug,
well,
then,
perhaps
that
would
have
been
appropriate.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
and
it
may
be
that
if
this
becomes
so
customary,
that
that
somehow
differently
calibrates
the
equation
here,
but
it
--
it's
sort
of
strange
credulity
to
think
that
you
would
have
loose
pills
concealed
against
a
student's
genitalia.
that's
what
you'd
have
to
think
was
the
custom
here.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
it
certainly
added
to
the
trauma
--
trauma,
justice
scalia.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
that's
--
that's
right.
that's
what
the
studies
say,
and
that
seems
like
a
reasonable
calibration
to
me.
you
know,
anything--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--without
any
location-specific
information,
that's
correct,
and
anything
else
would
send
a
shudder
down
the
spines
of
little
boys
and
girls
around
this
country.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
if
--
if
they
called
in
the
police
officers?
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
i
don't
think
that
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
well
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
a
lesser
or
more
traumatic.
both
--
both
are
fairly
traumatic.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
well--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--i'm
saying
both
are
remarkably
traumatic.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
i'm
not
putting
them
one
above
the
other.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
they
would
require
probable
cause.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
well
if
there's
probable
cause
and
they
want
to
call
the
police
officers
in,
then
they
can
do
that.
but
that's
not
what
happened
here.
what
this
school
official
did
was
act
on
nothing
more
than
a
hunch,
if
that,
that
savana
was
currently
concealing
ibuprofen
pills
underneath
her
underpants
for
other's
oral
consumption.
i
mean
there's
a
certain
ick
factor
to
this.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
did
you
say
the
prisoner?
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
mr.
chief
justice?
well,
yes,
in
the
prison
context,
the
rules
are
different.
they
are
different,
because
this
court
has--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--well
it
--
the
brassiere
i
think
as
well.
i
mean
there
--
there
was
nothing
in
this
record
that
even
the
principal
or
assistant
principal
said
i
suspect
that
it
was
there.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
well--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--no,
but
neither
--
neither
do
they.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
yes,
but
the
"not
beyond
human
experience"--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--but
the
"not
beyond
human
experience"
standard
is
not
the
standard
that
governs
whether
the
fourth
amendment
is
violated.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
right.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
that
seems
like
a
factual
question
to
me,
justice
alito.
i
mean,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
--
to
indicate
otherwise.
and
we
haven't
moved
for
summary
judgment
here,
but
all
inferences
are
resolved
in
our
favor
when
petitioners
have
moved
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
whether
something
rises
to
the
level
of
probable
cause?
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
it
strikes
me
as
a
factual
question,
your
honor,
that
may
or
may
not
--
i
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--i
think
in
this
case
it
certainly
is
a
jury
question,
without
anything
else
in
the
record
that
that
--
that
that
is
a
reasonable
inference,
and
without
it
being
self-evident
--
and
i
would
actually
argue
that
it
was
self-evident
that
those
pills
were
not
located
there
and
that
that's
not
a
reasonable
inference.
but
if
there
is
some
doubt
about
that
--
and
i
was
hearing
some
doubt
from
justice
breyer
and
perhaps
other
members
of
this
court
--
well,
that
strikes
me
as
a
factual
question.
and
if
that's
a
factual
question
to
be
resolved
by
a
jury,
there
must
be
a
principle
behind
that,
which
is
that
if
it
is
not
a
reasonable
inference
that
those
objects
were
located
there,
then
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
search.
and
if
that's
true,
then
qualified
immunity,
at
least
at
this
stage,
was
properly
denied.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
well,
whether
something
was
a
reasonable
inference
or
not,
it
might
strike
one
as
a
reasonable
inference--
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
--and
another
as
not
a
reasonable
inference.
mr.
adam
b.
wolf
right,
because
for
the
ninth
circuit,
this
--
it
was
self-evident
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
--
that
there
was
not
a
reasonable
inference.
and
without
that
reasonable
inference,
there
was
no
reason
to
treat
it
as
a
jury
question,
but
if
there
were
a
reasonable
inference,
then
it
strikes
me
as
something
that
might
be
--
that
might
be
better
suited
for
determination
by
the
jury.
thank
you.
