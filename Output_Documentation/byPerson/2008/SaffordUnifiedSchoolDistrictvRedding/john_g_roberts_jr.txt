chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-479,
safford
unifed
school
district
v.
redding.
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
any
place,
even
though
he
had
perhaps
no
reasonable
suspicion
to
suspect
that
she
was
hiding
the
contraband
in
her
underwear?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
any
place?
i
mean,
prison
inmates,
for
example,
are
subject
to
much
more
intrusive
searches.
are
you
suggesting
that
would
have
been
justified
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
ask
just
a
follow-up
on
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
earlier
question
about
whether
the
informant
was
subject
to
civil
suit.
when
you
said
no,
did
you
mean
she
hadn't
been
sued
or
that
she
could
not
be
sued?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
was
the
--
when
was
she
detained
there
in
relation
to
the
lunchtime
period,
which
was
when
the
other
student
had
said
that
all
the
kids
were
going
to
take
these
pills?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
mr.
o'neil.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
you
get
started,
do
we
have
to
reach
the
underlying
merits
or
can
we
just
decide
the
qualified
immunity
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
should
--
should,
but
must?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
sounds
like
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
sounds
to
me
like
the
sliding
scale
that
you
reject
from
the
ninth
circuit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
surely
not.
you
are
saying
if
you
have
reasonable
suspicion
that
it's
in
the
underwear,
you
shouldn't
even
bother
searching
the
pack
or
the
pockets.
you
should
go
straight
to
the
underwear.
that
can't
be
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
your
--
accepting
your
argument
that
there
may
be
no
reasonable
suspicion
based
on
marissa
saying
this
is
the
person
who
gave
me
the
drugs,
does
the
fact
that
she
said
kids
are
going
to
--
the
kids
are
going
to
take
these
drugs
at
lunchtime,
a
specific
time,
does
that
present
a
difference
in
the
level
of
concern
that
the
school
should
have?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
a
school
administrator
supposed
to
know?
marissa
says:
she
gave
me
these
pills.
what
are
they?
i
don't
know.
and
so
how
is
the
--
if
it
depends
whether
it's
a
dangerous
drug
like
crack
or
a
relatively
--
not
harmless,
but
a
different
one
like
ibuprofen,
the
search
depends
on
that,
how
is
the
school
administrator
supposed
to
know?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
is
the
school
administrator
supposed
to
know
when
he
sees
a
white
pill
and
doesn't
know
if
it's
something
terribly
harmful,
even
deadly,
or
if
it's
prescription
strength
ibuprofen?
you
say
in
the
former
case
he
can
search
undergarments,
in
the
latter
case
he
can't.
so
how
is
the
administrator
supposed
to
know
what
he's
dealing
with?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
answer
to
me
was
they
have
to
take
it
seriously.
my
question
to
you
is,
what
is
the
administrator
supposed
to
do?
he
sees
a
white
pill;
nobody
can
tell
him
what
it
is.
is
he
allowed
at
that
point
to
search
the
undergarments
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he's
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
it
turns
out
to
be
--
you
know,
i
don't
know,
some
very
deadly
drug?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
what
you
just
told
us
we
should
do,
in
answer
to
justice
alito's
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
wolf.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
case
can
begin
and
end
with
that
because
we
have
the
separate
issue
of
qualified
immunity.
can
we
take
that
off
the
table?
i
mean,
we
have
got
six
to
five
in
the
ninth
circuit,
disagreement
throughout
in
this
case,
and
yet
you
say
the
rule
is
so
clearly
established
that
you
can
make
these
school
officials
personally
liable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
if
what
marissa
has
is
heroin?
the
school
administrator
recognizes
heroin.
she
says:
this
is
what
the
student
gave
me?
search
the
undergarments
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
combine
it
with
--
with
your
answers
to
justice
kennedy,
you
are
saying
it's
unreasonable
to
take
off
the
outer
garments
even
if
your
suspicion,
reasonable
suspicion
for
justifying
the
preliminary
search
is
that
the
student
has
heroin?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you've
made
that
point
several
times.
in
fact
the
issue
here
covers
the
brassier
as
well,
which
doesn't
seem
as
outlandish
as
the
underpants,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
i'm
--
maybe
i'm
not
articulating
this.
you
keep
focusing
on
the
fact
that
it's
unlikely
that
the
pills
would
be
concealed
in
her
underpants.
that
doesn't
go
to
the
brassiere
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
wolf.
mr.
wright,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-479,
safford
unified
school
district
versus
redding.
