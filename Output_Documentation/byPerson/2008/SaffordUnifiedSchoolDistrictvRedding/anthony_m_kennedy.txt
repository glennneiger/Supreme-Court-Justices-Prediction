justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
she
subject
to
a
civil
suit
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
know
whether
or
not
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
border
search
cases
a
body
cavity
search
can
be
conducted
without
a
warrant?
i
thought
a
warrant
was
required
under
the
ninth
circuit
rule.
i
could
ask
the
government.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
--
you
criticized
the
ninth
circuit
in
your
brief
for
having
a
sliding
scale
standard,
which
is
a
bad
thing
in
your
view.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
your
standard
comes
close
to
that.
you
call
yours
a
differential
level
standard
or
something
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
quite
sure
where
we
are
in
your
answer
to
the
question
of
the
chief
justice's
question.
he
asked
you
a
hypothetical
case.
and
you
said
that's
a
nonstarter
because
in
this
case.
and
the
hypothetical
is
that
there
is
a
very
dangerous
drug,
meth,
that's
going
to
be
distributed
and
consumed
that
afternoon.
does
that
make
a
difference
in
the
permissibility
of
the
search
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
and
the
scope
of
the
search?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
don't
mind
our
judging
this
case
as
if
they
were
searching
for
meth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
way
--
we
should
--
we
should
judge
this
case
as
though
they
were
searching
--
the
fact
that
it
was
--
is
it
ibuprofen,
have
i
got
that?
the
fact
that
it
was
ibuprofen
is
irrelevant;
we
can
consider
this
case
as
if
it
were
meth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
think
i
understand
that
based
on
your
answer.
i'm
--
i'm
asking
you
--
you
said
that
the
nature
of
the
drug
makes
no
difference,
it's
a
nonstarter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
insofar
as
the
rule
that
we
--
that's
because
in
this
case
you
don't
think
there's
a
reasonable
suspicion
to
begin
with.
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
hypothetical.
we're
trying
to
announce
a
rule.
and
your
rule,
your
submission,
as
i
understand
you
and
as
i
understood
the
government,
is
that
the
nature
of
the
substance
they're
searching
for
is
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
goes
back
to
my
earlier
proposition
that
you
don't
mind
our
deciding
the
case
as
if
this
were
a
search
for
meth
that
was
going
to
be
consumed
at
noon?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
about
spine
shuddering.
[laughter]
let's
go
back
to
justice
souter's
question.
we
assume
that
there's
meth,
something
very
dangerous,
going
to
be
smoked
at
noon,
there's
very
strong
suspicion
of
this
student.
the
assistant
principal
says
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
choice:
we're
going
to
engage
in
an
intrusive
search,
same
sex
people,
like
what
went
on
here;
or
we're
going
to
call
the
local
police
department,
we'll
have
probable
cause
to
book
you
and
they
will
search
you
at
the
jail
house.
which
do
you
choose?
would
the
school
administrators
be
violating
their
duty
if
they
did
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
give
the
student
the
choice.
they
say
we'll
do
it
here
with
a
nurse
right
here,
where
you
know
everybody,
and
there's
nothing
wrong'
or
we'll
call
the
police,
and
they'll
do
it
down
at
the
police
station.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
--
which
would
be
the
less
traumatic
of
the
two
choices
for
the
student?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
it's
less
traumatic,
or
it
might
be
less
traumatic
to
have
uniformed
police
officers
take
the
person
to
the
police
station
and
conduct
the
search
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
us
to
decide
the
case
on
the
fact
that
that's
probably
less
traumatic
for
the
student?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
hypothetical
wasn't
there
a
probable
cause?
