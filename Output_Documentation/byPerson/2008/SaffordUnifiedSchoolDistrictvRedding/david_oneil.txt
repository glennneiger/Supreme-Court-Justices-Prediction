mr.
david
o'neil
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
intrusive
body
searches
in
the
school
context
implicate
fundamentally
different
expectations
of
privacy
than
other
--
other
kinds
of
searches.
for
that
reason,
they
require
greater
justification
under
the
fourth
amendment.
in
the
government's
view,
the
best
way
to
give
effect
to
that
greater
showing
is
to
adhere
to
the
basic
reasonable
suspicion
standard
of
t.l.o.,
but
to
elaborate
on
that
standard
in
two
ways.
first--
mr.
david
o'neil
--the
government
agrees
with
the
parties
and
all
amici
in
this
case
that
this
court
should
address
the
substantive
fourth
amendment
issue.
mr.
david
o'neil
this
court
could
decide
the
case
on
qualified
immunity
grounds
alone.
mr.
david
o'neil
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
o'neil
well,
this
court
could
remand
on
monell
grounds
for
a
hearing
on
that,
which
was
not
addressed
in--
mr.
david
o'neil
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
o'neil
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
show
that
this
search
was
conducted
pursuant
to
a
--
an
official
policy
or
that
the
vice
principal
was
a
person
who
was
acting
with
that
authority.
there
are
a
number
of
grounds
that
--
that
the
plaintiff
could
establish
the
monell
claim
on
the
basis
of,
but
in
this
case
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
address
that.
and,
therefore,
we
believe
that
this
court
should
not
review
in
the
first
instance,
but
if
the
court
were
inclined
to
remand
on
that
ground
to
allow
the
ninth
circuit
to
address
it
before
this
court
reaches
that.
mr.
david
o'neil
no,
justice
kennedy.
our
standard
is
one
of
greater
specificity
in
the
information,
not
a
standard
that
rises
and
falls
depending
on
the
level
of
intrusiveness.
mr.
david
o'neil
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
o'neil
no,
justice
scalia,
we
believe
that
you
don't--
mr.
david
o'neil
--without
--
without--
mr.
david
o'neil
--well,
justice--
mr.
david
o'neil
--well,
justice
scalia,
you
posited
that
the
teacher
began
the
search
with
reasonable
suspicion.
and
in
that
case,
if
you
searched
the
obvious
places
like
a
wallet,
a
pocket,
a
desk,
a
locker,
and
you
didn't
find
it
in
those
places,
the
logical
conclusion
would
not
be
that
it
must
be
in
the
student's
underwear,
but
perhaps
that
the
information
that
you
had--
mr.
david
o'neil
--no,
because
we
believe
that
where
you
have
reasonable
suspicion
that
there
is
contraband
in
the
underwear,
then
you
could
go
directly
to
that
location,
and
you
wouldn't
have
to
work
from
the
outside
in.
but,
justice
scalia,
it
takes--
mr.
david
o'neil
--well,
to
take
t.l.o.
as
an
example,
justice
scalia,
in
that
case
the
court
believed
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
student
had
cigarettes
in
her
purse
because
that
was
the
obvious
place
to
find
them.
now,
if
the
--
if
the
school
principal
in
that
case
had
searched
the
purse,
searched
the
student's
pocket,
searched
the
locker,
searched
the
desk,
i
don't
think
this
court
would
have
said
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
the
cigarettes
were
in--
mr.
david
o'neil
--the
particularized
suspicion
could
come
from
information
from
students
that
reliably
adverted
to
the
location
of
the
contraband.
that's
the--
mr.
david
o'neil
--no--
mr.
david
o'neil
--no,
justice
alito.
we
believe
that
if
teachers
were
aware
of
the
general
practice
and
it
was
common
knowledge
that
students
did
hide
contraband
in
this
way
and
--
that
would
be
relevant
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
determining
whether
this
student
was
following
that
practice.
but
we
don't
believe
that
the
examples
that
were
provided
in
petitioners'
reply
brief
establish
anything
like
that
practice.
petitioners
cite
8
cases
over
the
course
of
approximately
30
years
in
which
contraband
was
found
in
those
locations.
mr.
david
o'neil
that
is
--
that
is
true.
there
was
no
experience
at
this
school.
there
was
no
reasonable
--
no
reason
to
suspect
that
based
on
experience
in
the
world.
and,
in
fact,
by
the
time
the
officials
had
conducted
their
--
this
search,
they
had
searched
marissa,
who
was
respondent's
friend.
and
they
had
conducted
a
search
of
her
pockets
and
her
wallet
and
they
had
found
pills
in
her
pockets
and
her
wallet.
but
they
had
not
found
pills
in
her
underwear.
so
even
if
that
had
been
a
suspicion
that
one
might
have
had
even
before
beginning
the
search,
they
certainly
wouldn't
have
had
that
suspicion
by
the
time--
mr.
david
o'neil
--we
believe
that
the
schools
may
take
seriously
any
information
they
receive
and
must
take
seriously
any
information
they
receive
about
the
presence
of
prescription
pills
on
campus.
and
the
fact
that
the
teacher
believed
that
these
pills
were
going
to
be
consumed
at
lunch
as
part
of
an
event
that
obviously
wasn't
simply
intended
to
get
rid
of
the
students'
headaches,
we
believe
that
that
would
give
rise
to
reasonable
suspicion
to
initiate
some
search.
but
we
believe
that
without
some
particularized
suspicion
or
some
specific
indication
that
this,
the
location,
was
a
likely
one
to
contain
the
drugs,
that
this
search
was
excessively
intrusive.
and
this
is
not
a
new
standard.
this
is
essentially
the
same
standard
this
court
adopted
in
the
montoya
de
hernandez
case
for
intrusive
body
searches
in
other
contexts.
it
has
proved
workable
in
that
context
and
we
believe
that
it
would
prove
workable
here.
we
believe
that
it
is
also
better
than
the
alternatives
of
a
higher
level
of
suspicion,
which
does
not
bear
any
necessary
logical
correlation
to
the
likelihood
that
the--
mr.
david
o'neil
--it
may
well,
justice
alito.
in
that
circumstance
it
would
likely
be
the
reasonable
thing
for
the
teacher--
mr.
david
o'neil
--that
may
present
a
triable
issue.
here--
mr.
david
o'neil
--no,
justice
scalia.
we
believe
that
there
must
be
information
beyond
that.
and
i
may
have
misspoke,
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
in
that
circumstance,
a
teacher
would
almost
certainly
ask,
well,
where
on
her
person
is
it?
and
if
the
student
doesn't
know,
then,
yes,
justice
scalia,
that
would
not
satisfy
the
standard
that
we
would
urge
this
court
to
adopt.
mr.
david
o'neil
the
nature
of
the
contraband--
mr.
david
o'neil
--the
nature
of
the
contraband
could
be
relevant
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
to
the
suspicion
that
the
student
has
--
is
hiding
it
in
some
illicit
place
as
--
justice
souter,
as
you
noted,
certainly
there
is
no
practice
anywhere,
that
i'm
aware
of,
of
hiding
ibuprofen
in
underwear.
mr.
david
o'neil
no.
it
simply
means
that
it's
relevant
to
whether
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
school
official
could
have
reasonably
suspected
that
the
student
was
hiding
it.
mr.
david
o'neil
my
point
was
simply
with
a
drug
like
crack
there
is
a
more
common
understanding
that
a
drug
like
that
can
be
hidden
in
a
student's
--
in
underwear.
mr.
david
o'neil
well,
we
believe
that,
as
i
said,
school
administrators
have
to
take
seriously
all
medication
like
this
on
campus.
my
point
was
simply
that
where
a
particular
type
of
contraband
is
known
to
be
carried
in
a
certain
way,
that
can
be
relevant
to
the
totality--
mr.
david
o'neil
--no.
mr.
david
o'neil
he
is
not.
mr.
david
o'neil
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
not
believe
that
this
court
should
get
in
the
business
of
deciding
that
searches
are
okay
for,
for
example,
heroin,
but
not
okay
for
cocaine.
mr.
david
o'neil
no,
i
simply
--
the
point
was
simply
that
if
there
is
some
common
understanding
that
a
type
of
contraband
is
generally
secreted
in
a
certain
way,
and
the
example
is
crack,
and
there
is
a
known
understanding
that
crack
can
be
hidden
in
that
way,
that
that
would
be
relevant
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
david
o'neil
it
may,
justice
souter,
but
i
think
that
the
question
would
be
whether
the
school
official
has
some
reason
to
believe,
based
on
a
practice,
that
--
that
pills,
for
example,
are
hidden
in
a
student's
--
can
be
hidden
in
a
student's
underwear.
again,
the
example
was
crack,
and
that
is
a
situation
where
there
is
an
understanding
that
that
is
--
can
be
a
place
in
which
suspects
will
hide
that
type
of
item.
but,
again,
there
was
no
indication
in
this
case
whatsoever
and
no
basis
for
the
school
official
to
suspect
that
that
was
a
likely
location.
mr.
david
o'neil
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
