justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
--
i
think
you're
really
caught
in
--
in
a
dilemma
here.
your
answer
suggests
that
you
would
not
have
allowed
a
cavity
search
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
people
have
been
known
to
secrete
contraband
in
--
in
bodily
cavities.
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
principle
under
which
you
would
allow
a
strip
search
but
disallow
a
cavity
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
had
it
been--
justice
antonin
scalia
--had
it
been
the
case
that,
as
i
recall,
someone
had
--
well,
students
were
popping
ibuprofen,
weren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
they
might
pop
aspirin
as
well.
i'm
not
aware
that
one
gets
a
high
on
either
one
of
those.
somebody
in
--
in
the
school
had
gotten
almost
fatally
ill
about
a
year
before
this
incident;
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
over-the-counter
drugs.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
prescription,
not
over-the-counter.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
school
know
what
--
what
particular
pills
it
was
searching
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
it
know
that
--
what
--
what
the
threat
was
was
ibuprofen
or
aspirin
or
--
or
some
prescription
drug?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
did
he
know
it
was
an
otc
pill?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
by
looking
at
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
in
it?
did
he
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--any
contraband,
like
the
black
marker
pencil
that
--
that
astounded
me.
that
was
contraband
in
that
school,
wasn't
it,
a
black
marker
pencil?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
is
that
what
they
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
sniff
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
come
back
to
your
distinguishing
a
strip
search
from
a
cavity
search.
what
would
you
require
before
you
would
allow
a
cavity
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
cavity
search
in
school,
no
matter
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
a
school
can
assign
a
student
to
study
hall.
that's
not
considered
a
government
seizure.
isn't
that
an
obvious
part
of
the
parental
supervision
that
a
school
exercises,
sit
here
and
stay
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
schools
do
that
all
the
time,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
about
any
strip
search,
couldn't
you:
that
there
is
never
a
need
for
a
strip
search?
you
could
always
give
the
--
you
know,
the
suspected
felon,
you
know:
here,
change
into
this
suit.
and
--
and
we
haven't
adopted
some
such
rule,
have
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
one
of
the
defendants
doesn't
have
qualified
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
don't
we
have
to,
for
that
defendant
at
least,
decide
the
constitutional
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
have
to,
under
your
standard,
have
reason
--
a
reasonable
suspicion
specifically
that
--
that
the
student
is
hiding
the
contraband
in
the
student's
underwear?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
--
if
you
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
student
has
drugs
and
you
search
every
other
place,
you
search
in
the
student's
pack,
you
search
the
student's
outer
garments,
and
you
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
student
has
drugs,
don't
you
have,
after
conducting
all
these
other
searches,
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
she
has
drugs
in
her
underpants?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
logic
fails
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
reasonably
suspect
the
student
has
drugs.
you've
searched
everywhere
else.
by
god,
the
drugs
must
be
in
her
underpants.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
that
wouldn't
--
that
wouldn't
satisfy
the
test
you've
just
given
us.
i
thought
you
said
there
had
to
be
specific
indication
that
she
was
carrying
it
in
her
undergarments.
and
what
justice
alito
posed
was
not
that,
just
specific
indication
that
she
had
it
on
her
person.
is
that
enough?
do
you
want
to
revise
your
test
so
it's
not
just
specific
indication
that
it's
in
her
undergarments,
but
specific
indication
that
it's
on
her
person?
that's
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
is
a
sliding
scale
for
the
dangerousness
of
what
you're
looking
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
the
whole
search,
not
just
the
search
of
the
undergarments.
you're
saying
they
couldn't
even
have
searched
her
backpack,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
want
a
sliding
scale?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
--
as
i
understand
your
--
your
presentation,
you
qualify
as
a
strip
search
any
search
that
requires
the
outer
garments
to
be
taken
off.
so
it
didn't
really
matter
whether
they
required
her
to
shake
out
her
bra
or
stretch
the
elastic
of
her
underwear?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
is
a
strip
search
and
--
impermissible
along
the
lines
you
say,
to
require
the
student
to
even
take
off
the
outer
garments?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
police
would
require--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
police
would
require
probable
cause,
wouldn't
they,
not
just
suspicion?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
probable
cause
a
jury
question
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
probable
cause
in
the
ordinary
criminal
investigation
cases.
is
that
a
jury
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
a
jury
question.
you
can
--
even
--
even
in
a
1983
action,
i
don't
think
the
courts
allow
a
jury
to
decide
whether
there
was
probable
cause
for
an
officer's
search
or
seizure.
that's
new
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
the
people
feel
differently.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
school
districts
have
rules
against--
justice
antonin
scalia
--simply
forbidding
strip
searches
on
any
--
right?
