was
there--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
there
prior
experience
in
this
particular
school?
were
there
prior
occasions
on
which
students
had
been
strip-searched
and
contraband
found?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
was
that
in
the
--
in
the
school's
experience,
children
do
hide
contraband
in
their
underwear
but
not
in
their
body
cavities.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
was
--
what
was
the
drug
involved
in
that
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
certainly
was
not
ibuprofen?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
it
was
a
prescription
drug.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
he
--
he
was
not
the
one
who
identified
redding.
it
was
her
classmate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
on
that
classmate's
say-so
--
was
the
classmate
ever
asked,
well,
when
did
you
get
this
pill?
where
did
she
give
it
to
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
what
place.
i
mean,
the
child
is
caught
with
the
pills.
she
blames
it
on
her
classmate.
she
says:
she
gave
them
to
me.
did
the
school
ever
bother
to
ask
when
in
time
she
gave
them,
where
in
location
she
gave
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
contemporaneous
with
the
--
with
the
student
who
blamed
the
other
child.
i'm
asking
if
there's
any
link
other
than
one
child
caught
with
the
pills
blurts
out
that
it
was
someone
else?
the
tip
from
the
young
man
had
nothing
to
do
with
redding;
it
had
to
do
with
glines.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
it
becomes
reliable
as
to
her,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
redding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
case,
this
case,
the
school
nurse
--
the
pills
were
given
to
the
school
nurse
and
she
identified
what
they
were.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
has
to
be
--
i
mean,
some
--
the
stark
difference
between
this
case
and
t.l.o.,
in
addition
to
the
intrusiveness
of
the
search,
was
there
was
a
teacher
said:
i
caught
those
girls;
they
were
smoking
in
the
bathroom.
here
we
have
nothing
but
this
glines
identifying
her
classmate.
and
nothing
is
done
to
check
her
veracity,
nothing
is
done
to
follow
up
on
it
at
all.
and
the
search
is
quite
different
from
the
search
of
a
purse
that
doesn't
touch
the
child's
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
an
official
could
follow
up
to
see
whether
this
child
--
whether
there
is
a
basis
for
what
she
said.
but
there
were
no
questions
asked
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one
aspect
of
this
considering
the
reasonableness
of
the
school
administrator's
behavior.
in
addition
to
not
following
up
with
glines,
after
redding
was
searched
and
nothing
was
found,
she
was
put
in
a
chair
outside
the
vice
principal's
office
for
over
2
hours
and
her
mother
wasn't
called.
what
was
the
reason
for
that
humiliating,
putting
her
in
that
humiliating
situation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
were
they
investigating
her
when
they
did
nothing
but
put
her
in
a
chair
outside
the
vice
principal's
office?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
be,
mr.
o'neil,
the
basis
for
the
monell
claim?
that
would
be
against
the
school
district?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
the
plaintiff
have
to
show
to
establish
a
claim
under
monell?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolf,
one
thing
should
be
clarified.
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
what
was
done
in
the
case
of
both
of
these
girls.
it
wasn't
just
that
they
were
stripped
to
their
underwear.
they
were
asked
to
shake
their
bra
out,
to
--
to
shake,
stretch
the
top
of
their
pants
and
shake
that
out.
there's
no
dispute,
factual
dispute
about
that,
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
no
dispute
that
they
asked
her
to
shake
her
pants
and
her
bra.
nobody
said
that
they
touched
--
the
school
officials
didn't
touch
her,
that's
a
given.
but
they
did
ask
her
to
shake
out
her
underwear.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
with
mr.
o'neil
when
he
said
if
the
drug
had
been
cocaine,
and
it's
well
known
that
cocaine
is
carried
in
underwear,
that
then
this
would
not
run
afoul
of
the
fourth
amendment?
he
gave
an
example
of
a
drug
where
there
was
a
custom
of
carrying
it
in
a
certain
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
has
to
be
that
student.
it
can't
be
that
it's
customary
among
students?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
wouldn't
the
police--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
the
ninth
circuit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
the
ninth
circuit
treat
this
as
a
jury
question?
i'm
looking
at
page
38a.
they
were
quite
definite
that
that
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
there
would.
there's
a
monell
claim
against
the
school
district
because
there
is
no
qualified
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
