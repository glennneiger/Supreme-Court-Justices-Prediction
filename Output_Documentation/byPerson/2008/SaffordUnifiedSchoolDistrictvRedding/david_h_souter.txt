justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
about
another
bright-line
rule
that
i
think
you're
assuming.
you
--
you
said
in
the
course
of
describing
the
justification
for
this
search
that
one
--
one
of
the
points
of
justification
was
that
there
was
a
health
and
safety
risk.
and
i
assume
from
the
way
you
put
it
that
you
are
grouping
every
drug,
prescription
or
over
the
counter,
as
posing
a
health
and
safety
risk;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
--
why
should
we
accept
that
--
that
blanket
assumption?
i
mean,
at
some
point
it
gets
silly.
having
--
having
an
aspirin
tablet
does
not
present
a
health
and
safety
risk,
and
yet
that's
an
over-the-counter
drug,
and
presumably
you
would
have
gone
through
the
same
search
for
--
for
an
aspirin
that
was
conducted
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
and
i
agree
with
you,
and
i
--
i
don't
have
any
question
with
this
kind
of
a,
let's
say,
a
--
a
broad
swath
of
judicial
hands-off
in
determining
what
is
a
risk
and
what
isn't.
but
at
some
point
it
becomes
sufficiently
questionable
that
i
do
think
we
have
to
raise
it.
and
if
your
rule
would
criminalize
--
i
shouldn't
say
"criminalize"
--
would
put
aspirin
in
the
contraband
category
and
justify
the
kind
of
search
that
went
on
here,
i
think
we've
reached
the
questionable
point.
and
i
--
my
question
to
you
now
is,
why
haven't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
have
you
ever
made
--
has
your
side
of
the
case
ever
made
the
argument
that
it
needs
this
sort
of
blanket
classification
rule,
any
drug
over
the
counter
or
prescription,
because
when
a,
a
pill
is
found,
they're
not
pharmacists,
they
don't
know
what
it
is,
and
therefore
they've
got
to
have
a
blanket
rule
or
they
simply
cannot
act
effectively?
i
did
not
see
that
argument
in
the
briefs.
has
that
argument
been
raised
at
any
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
where
did
you
argue
it?
i
mean,
i
want
to
know
whether
that
argument
is
in
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it?
i
don't
remember
it.
do
you
remember
a
page?
do
you
have
a
page
reference
offhand?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
say
it's
in
your
brief?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
i'll
go
back.
justice
david
h.
souter
your
basis
--
your
basis
for
saying
that,
i
guess,
is
just
sort
of
the
practical
one,
we
don't
know
how
to
do
that
type
of
thing.
so
far
as
the
legal
principle
on
the
basis
of
which
you
justified
this
search,
you
could
justify
that
search,
too,
couldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
--
if
we
hold
in
your
favor
in
this
case
and
the
next
school
district
says,
all
right,
we're
going
to
have
classes
in
body
cavity
searches,
then
there
would
be
no
legal
basis,
if
we
accept
your
principle,
for
saying
that's
out
of
bounds
as
a
matter
of
the
fourth
amendment;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
would
not
--
it
would
not
be
out
of
bounds
under
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
are
--
you
are
saying
basically
there
is
--
there
is
no
general
understanding
that
people
carry
ibuprofen
in
--
in
their
undergarments.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
don't
see
why
your
answer
might
not
be
different
if,
under
the
chief
justice's
question,
he
didn't
know
it
was
ibuprofen.
all
he
knew
was
that
it
was
a
white
pill.
he's
not
a
pharmacologist,
he
doesn't
know
what's
in
it.
wouldn't
the
reasonableness
of
the
--
wouldn't
the
scope
of
reasonable
search
at
least
potentially
be
greater
for
the
undifferentiated
white
pill
than
for
the
known
ibuprofen?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
--
let
me
just,
not
so
much
change
the
facts,
but
--
but
emphasize
a
couple
of
different
aspects
of
the
facts.
assuming
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
of
a
moment
ago
and
assuming
the
following
thought
process
on
the
part
of
the
principal
--
i
--
strike
that.
i
will
vary
the
facts
in
one
way.
let's
assume,
following
your
categorical
rule
that
the
--
the
principal
doesn't
know
whether
it's
ibuprofen
or
not.
he
just
knows
that
there's
a
pill
and
one
of
the
other
kids
said
this
person
has
got
pills
on
--
on
her
person.
the
principal
says,
i
know
as
a
matter
of
reliable
fact
that
one
student
got
sick,
violently
sick,
within
the
past
week
or
so
on
some
pill;
we
don't
know
exactly
what
it
was.
we
also
know
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
from
where
we
are
now
that
there
have
been
kids
who
died
from
ingesting
dangerous
drugs.
i've
got
suspicion
that
some
drug
is
on
this
kid's
person.
my
thought
process
is
i
would
rather
have
the
kid
embarrassed
by
a
strip
search,
if
we
can't
find
anything
short
of
that,
than
to
have
some
other
kids
dead
because
the
stuff
is
distributed
at
lunchtime
and
things
go
awry.
is
that
the
basis?
is
that
thought
process,
that
reasoning,
the
basis
for
a
--
a
reasonable
strip
search?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
somewhere
between
the
surface
of
the
clothes
and
--
and
the
body.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
--
you
say
that
the
--
the
point
of
my
question,
this
is
what
i'd
like
you
to
focus
on
--
you're
entirely
right,
i
would
accept
that
argument
and
i
think
that
argument
is
entirely
right,
if
the
stakes
are
lower.
if
the
risk
of
a
mistake
is
going
to
be
less
traumatic.
in
the
hypo
that
i
gave,
the
risk
of
the
mistake
may
well
be
violent
sickness
or
death.
and
the
thought
process
in
the
principal's
mind
is,
the
reasonableness
analysis
in
the
principal's
mind
is
better
embarrassment
than
violent
sickness
or
death.
what's
wrong
with
that
reasoning
under
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
--
i'm
saying
it.
[laughter]
we
--
we've
got
a
new
case.
and
i'm
saying
to
you,
why
isn't
that
a
--
a
reasonable
thought
process
within
the
concept
of
fourth
amendment
reasonableness?
justice
david
h.
souter
you've
got
reasonable
suspicion
that
they
are
somewhere
on
the
person.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
with
those
stakes
in
mind,
why
isn't
it
reasonable?
in
other
words,
there
--
there
is
a
sliding
scale
of
risk
which
is
inherent
in
my
hypo,
and
why
isn't
that
a
sound
basis
for
a
--
a
fourth
amendment
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
have
a
belief;
i
simply
have
a
reasonable
suspicion.
that's
what
i've
got
all
along
the
way.
and
it
seems
to
me,
when
--
when
you
take
the
position
that
you
--
you
were
taking,
you
are
saying,
better
to
have
the
risk
of
violent
sickness
or
death
than
the
risk
of
embarrassment.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
some
search
is
--
is
reasonable,
i
take
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now
the
--
we
get
to
the
point
as
in
prior
hypos,
in
which
it
does
--
they
find
nothing
in
the
pockets.
they
find
nothing
in
the
pocket
book
or
other
garments.
the
only
thing
that's
left
is
a
strip
search,
and
that's
where
you
draw
the
line.
why
do
you
draw
the
line
there,
on
the
risk
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
savana
redding,
a
13-year
old
student
at
safford
middle
school
was
identified
by
a
fellow
student
as
having
brought
forbidden
prescription
and
over-the-counter
drugs
to
school.
savana
was
called
into
the
assistant
principal's
office
and
confronted
with
the
accusation.
she
denied
it
and
agreed
to
a
search
of
her
backpack.
no
pills
were
found.
she
was
then
taken
to
the
school
nurse's
office
where
the
nurse
and
an
administrator
asked
her
to
remove
her
clothes
and
pull
her
bra
and
underpants
away
from
her
body
an
action
that
necessarily
exposed
her
breast
and
pelvic
area
to
some
degree.
again,
no
pills
were
found.
savana's
mother
alleged
that
savana
have
been
subjected
to
a
strip
search
in
violation
of
her
fourth
amendment
rights
and
filed
suit
against
the
school
district
and
various
officials
including
the
assistant
principal,
named
kerry
wilson.
the
ninth
circuit
sitting
en
banc
hold
that
the
strip
search
was
unjustified
under
the
fourth
amendment
test
for
searches
of
children
by
school
officials
set
out
by
this
court
in
new
jersey
against
t.l.o.
the
en
banc
court
also
found
that
savana's
right
was
clearly
established
at
the
time
of
the
search
and
therefore
denied
assistant
principal
wilson
any
qualified
immunity.
we
now
affirm
in
part,
reverse
in
part
and
remand.
in
t.l.o.
we
applied
the
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion
to
determine
the
legality
of
the
school
administrated
search
of
a
student
and
held
that
a
school
search
and
these
were
our
words,
will
be
permissible
in
its
scope
when
the
measures
adopted
are
reasonably
related
to
the
objectives
of
the
search
and
are
not
excessively
intrusive
in
light
of
the
age
and
sex
of
the
student
and
the
nature
of
the
infraction.
in
this
case,
the
record
demonstrates
that
wilson
had
sufficient
suspicion
that
savana
was
giving
out
contraband
pills
to
justify
a
search
of
her
backpack
and
outer
clothing,
but
given
both
subjective
and
reasonable
societal
expectations
of
personal
privacy,
the
further
search
of
savana's
body
fairly
described
as
a
strip
search
must
be
treated
as
categorically
distinct
from
a
search
of
belongings
or
outer
clothing
it
therefore
requires
distinct
elements
of
justification
on
the
part
of
school
authorities.
here,
wilson
had
no
indication
of
danger
to
the
students
from
the
power
of
the
drugs
or
their
quantity
or
any
reason
to
suppose
that
savana
was
carrying
these
pills
in
her
underwear.
given
these
deficiencies
we
conclude
that
the
search
was
unreasonable.
t.l.o.
directed
school
officials
to
limit
the
intrusiveness
of
a
search
in
light
of
the
age
and
sex
of
the
student
and
the
nature
of
the
infraction.
it
is
clear
to
me
that
under
the
t.l.o.
test
the
intrusiveness
of
the
strip
search
here
cannot
be
seen
as
justifiably
related
to
the
circumstances.
but
judges
of
various
district
courts
and
courts
of
appeals
have
reached
divergent
conclusions
about
how
the
t.l.o.
standard
applies
to
such
searches
as
this
one.
these
differences
of
opinion
are
numerous
and
well-reasoned
enough
to
counsel
doubt
that
we
were
sufficiently
clear
in
the
prior
statement
of
law.
we
therefore
conclude
that
qualified
immunity
is
warranted
for
the
school
officials
in
this
case.
our
conclusions
do
not
resolve
the
question
of
the
liability
of
the
school
district
and
we
remanded
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
address
that
issue.
