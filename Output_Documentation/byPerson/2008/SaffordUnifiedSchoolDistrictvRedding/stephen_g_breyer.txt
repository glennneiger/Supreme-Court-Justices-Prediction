justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
aren't
there
things
here
that
are
a
little
extreme?
i
mean,
if
she's
to
be
believed,
then
she
was
really
naked,
and
the
two
administrators
deny
that,
but
you
have
to
take
her
side
of
the
facts.
so
taking
her
side
of
the
facts,
why
couldn't
the
school
administrators
just
do
what
they
said
they
did?
that
is,
you
leave
her
in
her
underwear,
tell
her:
go
shake
her
underwear.
no
reason
to
do
any
more
than
that.
or
if
she
is
really
embarrassed
about
that,
say:
go
put
on
a
swimming
suit,
you
know.
shake
the
swimming
suit,
no
problem.
people
see
you
at
the
beach
all
the
time.
or
call
your
mother.
i
mean,
you
know,
we
can
think
of
another
--
a
number
of
things
that
seem
a
lot
less
restrictive
than
her
version
of
what
went
on
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
i
mean,
here
she
is
embarrassed
if
--
if
what
she
says
happened
happened.
there
seems
no
reason
for
that,
and
it
seems
so
easy.
put
on
your
gym
clothes,
okay?
i
mean,
she
does
that
every
day.
it
is
just
such
obvious
alternatives
to
having
her
be
really
naked.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
what
i
--
i
don't
see
any
basis
for
saying
to
the
school
administrator,
you
know,
you
can
do
that.
you
can
just
turn
her
naked.
i
mean,
it
just
embarrasses
her.
what's
the
need
for
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
she
says
in
the
record
that
they
went
further
and
required
her
to
be
partly
naked
beyond
just
her
underwear.
they
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
so
that
was
my
question.
my
question
was:
why
wasn't
it?
i
wasn't
asking
about
the
law.
i
was
asking:
why
didn't
they
choose
one
of
these
alternatives?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--putting
things
in
their
underwear.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
think
there's
a
dispute
in
the
record
about
that.
so
--
so
we
have,
i
mean
you
would
have
the
right
to
prove
your
version,
obviously.
but
suppose
you
fail
to
prove
that
and
that
the
jury
or
judge,
or
whoever
is
deciding
this
fact,
concludes
the
school
board's
right
on
that;
all
they
did
was
ask
her
to
strip
to
her
underwear,
period.
nobody
saw
anything
else.
now,
what's
your
view
of
that
one?
i
mean,
let's
also
imagine
that
this
is
sufficient
to
prove
--
to
--
what
happened
was
marissa
opens
a
planner,
and
in
the
planner
there's
some
small
knives,
a
cigarette
lighter,
and
a
cigarette.
and
who
gave
you
the
planner?
well,
savana
gave
it
to
me.
and
they
find
some
pills.
let's
imagine
those
pills
are
cocaine
or
something
like
meth
or
something.
and
she
says
well,
where
did
you
get
those?
savana
gave
them
to
me.
okay.
that
seems
to
be
possibly
reasonable
suspicion
to
think
savana
has
some
of
these
pills.
and
they're
going
to
distribute
them
at
lunchtime.
at
that
point
they
go
look,
whatever
they
did
here.
but
then
they
bring
savana
in
to
the
nurse
and
the
nurse
and
the
female
official
say:
all
right,
savana,
strip
to
your
underclothes
and
shake
your
underclothes.
that's
what
happens,
period.
now,
is
that
latter
part
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
it
would
be
okay
to
say,
change
into
a
swimming
suit
or
your
gym
clothes?
hey,
your
gym
clothes
are
in
the
locker,
they're
about
the
same
size,
shape;
go
do
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
they
didn't
--
she
didn't
reveal
her
body
beyond
her
underclothes.
she
--
that's
the
hypothetical
that
i'm
trying
to
work
out
here,
because
i'm
not
certain.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
work
out
why
is
this
a
major
thing
to
say
strip
down
to
your
underclothes,
which
children
do
when
they
change
for
gym,
they
do
fairly
frequently,
not
to
--
you
know,
and
there
are
only
two
women
there.
is
--
how
bad
is
this,
underclothes?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
i'm
asking
because
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
thought
there
was,
because
i
thought
on
page
135
of
the
record
the
official
said
they
didn't
see
her
naked,
and
so
i
thought
that
there
was--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--my
question
--
my
question
has
to
do
with
accepting--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
they
said
on
page
135
of
the
record,
and
this
is
a
genuine
problem
i'm
having.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out,
if
that's
so,
and
to
repeat
it
--
you
heard
what
i
said,
there's
no
reason
to
repeat
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
want
to
know
why
that
search,
if
that's
what
happened,
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
assuming
reasonable
suspicion
to
think
she
possessed
meth
or
cocaine
at
that
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
the
psychologists
--
"strip
search"
has
a
lot
of
meanings.
and
do
the
psychologists
focus
on
the
situation
with
the
child
involved,
you
know,
this
is
an
--
my
hypothetical,
is
that
what
they're
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
like
you
have
any
studies
on
this.
but
i
mean,
i
hate
to
tell
you,
but
it
seems
to
me
like
a
logical
thing
when
an
adolescent
child
has
some
pills
or
something,
they
know
people
are
looking
for
them,
they
will
stick
them
in
their
underwear.
i'm
not
saying
everyone
would,
but
i
mean,
somebody
who
thinks
that
that's
a
fairly
normal
idea
for
some
adolescent
with
some
illegal
drugs
to
think
of,
i
don't
think
he's
totally
out
to
lunch,
is
he?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
any
studies
on
this?
i
doubt
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
in
my
experience
when
i
was
8
or
10
or
12
years
old,
you
know,
we
did
take
our
clothes
off
once
a
day,
we
changed
for
gym,
okay?
and
in
my
experience,
too,
people
did
sometimes
stick
things
in
my
underwear
----
[laughter]
or
not
my
underwear.
whatever.
i
was
the
one
who
did
it?
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
it's
beyond
human
experience,
not
beyond
human
experience.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
are
they
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
it's
supposed
to
be
what's
reasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
a
teacher
is
there
thinking
what's
reasonable?
and
i've
already
got
the
thing
sort
of
away
from
--
i
see
your
point.
i'm
not
quite
talking
about
that.
i'm
worried
about
what
to
write
in
this
as
a
general
standard.
and
so
am
i
supposed
to
say,
look,
school
--
school
officials
who
think
that
children
could
hide
things
in
their
underwear
when
they
know
they're
not
supposed
to
have
them,
is
that
school
official
really
unreasonable
except
in
a
special
case?
that's
what's
bothering
me.
