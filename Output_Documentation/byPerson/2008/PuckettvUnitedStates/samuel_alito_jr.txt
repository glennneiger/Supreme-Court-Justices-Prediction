justice
samuel

well,
the
judge
would
have
known
about
what
happened
anyway
from
--
from
the
presentence
investigation,
wouldn't
he?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
should
that
be
the
case?
i
know
plea
agreements
are
not
strictly
governed
by
contract
law,
but
there
is
an
analogy
and
your
whole
argument
seems
to
be
that
the
government's
breach
rendered
the
plea
agreement
void.
but
why
would
that
so?
there
was
a
plea
agreement,
voluntarily
entered
into,
and
then
there
was
a
breach.
so,
why
shouldn't
the
issue
be
what
is
the
remedy
for
the
breach?
and
why
shouldn't
it
be
governed
by
the
plain-error
rule
like
most
errors
that
occur
at
trial?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
can
say
that
in
every
case
in
which
parties
enter
into
a
contract
and
later
there
is
a
breach.
the
fact
that
one
of
the
parties
later
breaches
doesn't
mean
that
there
never
was
a
contract.
there
was
an
agreement
that
he
voluntarily
entered
into
at
that
time.
and
then
there
was
a
--
subsequently
there
was
a
breach,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
involuntarily
--
he
did
not
voluntarily
enter
into
the
agreement,
does
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
counsel
say
about
a
case
in
which
it's
unclear
whether
there
is
a
breach?
there
is
a
factual
dispute
as
to
whether
there
was
a
breach.
let's
say
the
government
agrees
that
it
will
reserve
the
right
to
call
all
relevant
facts
to
the
attention
of
the
sentencing
judge,
but
won't
take
a
position
on
sentencing.
and
the
prosecutor
in
sentencing
makes
certain
remarks
that
might
be
interpreted
as
taking
a
position
or
might
be
interpreted
as
simply
calling
facts
to
the
judge's
attention.
would
it
be
your
position
that
when
a
defendant
hears
that,
the
defendant
can
sit
back
and
wait
and
see
whether
he
or
she
is
satisfied
with
the
sentence
and
then
after
this
sentence
is
imposed
raise
the
issue
of
breach
on
appeal
and
not
be
subject
to
plain
error,
rather
than
calling
it
to
the
attention
of
the
sentencing
judge
at
the
time
when
the
--
the
potential
breach
could
be
adjudicated?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
really
answers
my
question.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
saying
as
to
some
errors
there
is
a
plain-error
rule,
in
some
breaches
there
is
a
plain-error
rule,
but
not
as
to
all
breaches?
