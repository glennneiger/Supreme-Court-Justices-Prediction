justice
david
h.
souter
your
point
is
not
that
he
should
have
gotten
the
reduction.
your
point
is
that
the
government
should
have
made
the
recommendation.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it?
isn't
that
your
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
agreement
called
for
them
to
make
a
recommendation
and
they
didn't
make
it.
in
fact,
they
recommended
the
contrary.
and
that's
your
gripe,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
--
why
should
the
defendant
have
the
option
to
withdraw
from
an
agreement
when
he
got
everything
under
the
best
possible
circumstances
that
he
could
have
expected?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
we
are
talking
about
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
at
this
point.
and
they
--
in
his
hypothetical,
the
sentencing
judge
says,
i'm
going
to
give
you
the
three
points;
you
are
going
to
get
everything
that
on
the
rosiest
scenario
you
could
have
hoped
for.
why
should
he
be
able
to
withdraw
his
plea
at
that
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
your
position
is
--
is
kind
of
a
theoretical
formalistic
position,
that
--
i'm
not
sure
if
this
is
the
wrong
words
here
--
there
is
a
metaphysical
quality
to
the
plea,
and
even
though
things
turn
out
as
well
to
him
as
he
could
possibly
have
expected
had
the
agreement
been
kept
punctiliously,
if
the
government
simply
omits
the
words
he
can
walk
away
from
the
plea?
i
mean,
that's
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
usually
--
i
mean,
the
theory
of
relief
in
contract
law
depends
upon
relief
from
something.
and
if,
in
fact,
there
is
--
there
is
no
discernible
damage
that
has
been
suffered,
if
on
the
other
hand
--
again,
taking
the
chief's
hypothetical
--
there
is
an
affirmative
demonstration
that
no
damage
occurred,
normal
principles
of
contract
would
say
there
is
nothing
to
give
him
relief
from.
the
law
of
contract
is
--
is
not
a
metaphysical
construct.
why
should
the
law
of
plea
agreements
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
you
are.
i
mean,
you
are
saying
even
though
he
has
come
out
with,
you
know,
a
rose
in
his
mouth,
he
can
still,
if
he
is
crazy
enough,
throw
away
the
whole
plea
agreement.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
i'm
getting
at
--
i
think
what
we
are
all
trying
to
get
at
--
is
in
order
to
have
a
rule,
an
absolute
rule
like
yours,
we
usually
look
for
a
good
reason
to
have
that
rule.
and
since
we
are
talking
about
an
agreement,
the
place
to
look
for
the
good
reason
is
in
the
consequences
to
the
defendant.
and
when
the
consequences
are
terrific,
when
they
are
the
best
that
he
could
possibly
have
hoped
for,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
good
reason
to
adopt
your
very
theoretical
construct
of
agreement.
is
there
some
reason
that
we
are
just
not
seeing?
justice
david
h.
souter
never
mind
what
the
government
can
cite.
i'm
asking
you
if
there
is
a
good
reason
to
adopt
this
absolute
rule
of
yours.
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me,
were
you
--
justice
kennedy,
were
you
through?
i'm
sorry,
i
thought
you
started
a
question
again.
the
problem
i
have
with
the
harmless
error
suggestion
that
you've
made
is
this.
if
the
government
does
engage
in
some
breach
of
the
agreement,
it
seems
to
me
the
consequence
is
that
an
individual
has
given
up
a
trial
and
as
a
consequence
of
that
has
given
up
liberty,
without
either
the
trial
that
he
is
entitled
to
or
fulfillment
of
the
conditions
for
giving
up
the
liberty.
and
isn't
there
--
isn't
there
a
very
high
value
to
be
placed
on
the
fact
that
nobody
in
the
united
states
under
the
constitutional
guarantees
should
be
--
should
be
sitting
behind
bars
without
either
a
conviction
following
full
trial,
invocation
of
whatever
rights
he
wants
to
invoke,
or
a
voluntary
agreement
to
be
behind
bars?
and
--
and
when
neither
of
those
conditions
is
fulfilled,
don't
we
have
an
error
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
cannot
be
regarded
as
harmless.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
--
i
think
i
would
agree
with
you
there
because,
by
whatever
means,
the
defendant
has
gotten
everything
the
defendant
bargained
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
have
come
by
a
more
circuitous
route,
but
he
got
it
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
the
case
when,
unlike
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical,
when
we
don't
know
that,
when
we
--
the
judge
sort
of
keeps
his
thoughts
to
himself
or
herself,
then
don't
we
have
the
--
the
problem
of
the
--
the
individual
behind
bars,
neither
as
a
result
of
trial
nor
as
a
result
of
the
deal
that
he
made?
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
--
whether
we
accept
that
proposition
or
not
that
the
analysis
must
differ,
doesn't
that
really
depend
on
--
on
what
value
we
place
on
the
importance
of
the
proposition
that
i
started
with?
if
somebody's
behind
bars,
it's
either
as
a
result
of
a
valid
conviction
after
trial
or
a
voluntary
agreement
that
says,
yeah,
i
will
stay
there.
and
if
--
if
we
place
a
very
high
value
on
the
liberty
interest
--
in
--
in
retaining
liberty
except
under
those
two
conditions,
then
isn't
it
fair
to
us
--
isn't
it
sensible
for
us
to
say
even
in
a
plain-error
situation,
we
are
going
to
recognize
this
--
this
kind
of
prejudice,
despite
the
fact
that
he
didn't
object?
if
we
place
a
high
value
on
the
liberty
interest,
we
wouldn't
accept
your
position;
isn't
that
fair?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
are
right,
there
is
no
question
about
it.
if
--
we
are
saying
we
will
take
a
--
a
less
efficient
process,
a
process
less
efficient
perhaps
even
for
getting
at
the
truth,
because
we
think
the
liberty
interest
is
that
important.
you
are
entirely
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
will
you
give
me
an
example?
justice
david
h.
souter
no
--
no
question,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
to
that
is,
it's
an
incentive
that
would
never
come
into
play
if
the
government
kept
its
word.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
why
--
why
should
--
why
is
the
government
really
in
a
position
to
object
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
could
the
breach
have
been
cured?
i
mean,
the
point
--
it
seems
to
me,
the
point
at
which
the
defendant
would
have
known
that
the
government
had
breached
the
agreement
was
when
the
government
stood
there
before
the
court
and
said,
"in
fact,
he
hasn't
accepted
responsibility.
"
"he
went
out
and
committed
another
crime
while
he
was
behind
bars.
"
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
point
--
and
maybe
this
phrase
occurred
somewhere
in
the
record
--
that
that's
a
bell
that
you
can't
unring.
for
the
defendant
to
get
up
and
object
and
said,
"wait
a
minute,
were
you
supposed
to
represent
to
the
court
that
you
agreed
that
i
did
accept
responsibility.
"
--to
require
the
government
to
fulfill
that
undertaking
at
that
point
would
have
been
ridiculous.
i
suppose
the
u.s.
attorney
could
have
said,
"oh,
yes,
he's
right,
judge.
"
"we
agreed
that
he
accepted
responsibility.
"
but
the
u.s.
attorney
has
already
just
said
a
moment
before,
"he
hasn't.
"
"we
really
don't
mean
that
at
all.
"
there's
no
way,
it
seems
to
me,
that
there
could
have
been
a
better
outcome
in
a
case
like
this,
even
if
the
objection
had
been
contemporary.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
would
have
been
silly.
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect,
that
is
not
what
olano
says,
is
it?
the
--
the
--
the
basic
olano
standard
is
a
--
is
a
violation
of
substantial
rights
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
one
way
that
you
could
show
a
violation
of
substantial
rights
would
be
a
--
a
demonstration
that
the
outcome
would
have
been
different.
but
another
possibility
of
showing
that
violation
is
--
is
whether
--
and
i
know
you
don't
accept
it,
but
it's
the
one
that
i
proposed
earlier,
there
is
a
violation
of
substantial
rights
if
somebody
is
sitting
behind
bars
without
having
gotten
there
by
the
performance
of
an
agreement
that
he
made,
or
as
a
result
of
a
trial.
and
that,
too,
could
satisfy
the
olano
formulation,
could
it
not?
