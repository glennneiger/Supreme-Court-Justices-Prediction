justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
used
to
teach
contract
law
and
i'll
tell
you
that
would
have
been
a
breach
of
contract.
that
would
have
been
a
breach
on
his
part.
now,
the
government
has
conceded
the
breach
of
the
plea
agreement.
i
don't
--
i
can't
understand
why
they
did
that,
but
they
apparently
have
conceded
it.
does
that
mean
that
we
have
to
ignore
it
for
purposes
of
deciding
what
the
--
what
the
remedy
is?
ignore
the
reality
that
there
was
a
breach?
i
mean,
you
know,
if
the
government
said,
we
will
ask
the
court
to
sentence
at
the
lower
end
because
of
the
--
the
remorse
that
the
defendant
has
shown,
and
the
defendant
then
demonstrates
that
he
has
no
remorse
by
--
you
know,
suppose
he
comes
and
stabs
the
judge
--
is
the
government
really
supposed
to
have
to
go
before
the
judge
and
say,
"your
honor,
this
man
is
really
remorseful
and
you
should
sentence
him
at
the
lower
end?
"
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
basic
principle
of
contract
law
that
a
party
to
a
contract
cannot
take
action
which
makes
it
impracticable
for
the
other
side
to
carry
out
his
part
of
the
bargain,
and
that's
what
your
client
did.
the
government
couldn't
practicably
go
in
and
make
that
argument
when
he
had
demonstrated
himself
to
be
an
unremorseful
criminal.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that
in
the
record,
do
you
know
offhand?
where
the
plea
agreement
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
it
suffice
to
give
your
client
everything
that
he
was
entitled
to
if
the
case
were
remanded
to
a
different
judge
and
the
government
were
required
to
go
before
that
judge
and
make
the
commitment
that
it
undertook
in
the
plea
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
perfectly
satisfactory
remedy?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
have
to
say
that.
but
let's
assume
i
don't
agree
with
that.
let's
assume
i
agree
with
justice
alito
that
his
entry
into
it
was
voluntary
and
all
that's
happened
is
that
one
of
the
commitments
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
parties
has
not
been
complied
with.
why
isn't
it
an
adequate
remedy
for
that
problem
to
send
it
back
to
a
new
judge
and
have
the
government
come
before
that
judge
and
make
the
same
commitment
it
was
supposed
to
under
the
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
retroactively
render
the
government's
promise
a
misrepresentation.
every
time
a
--
a
party
to
a
contract
fails
to
comply
with
a
contract,
he
hasn't
been
guilty
of
fraud.
"misrepresentation"
would
mean
the
government
had
no
intention
of
complying
with
it
when
--
when
it
entered
into
it,
and
you
--
you
don't
assert
that
was
the
case,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
saying,
if
--
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
that
even
if
at
the
trial
your
client's
lawyer
had
objected
and
had
--
and
had
said,
your
honor,
the
government
promised
to
recommend,
you
know,
a
lower
thing,
what
the
trial
judge
would
have
to
have
said
was,
the
plea
agreement
is
invalid.
and
the
trial
judge
could
not
say,
oh,
yes,
the
government
has
to
make
that
recommendation.
you
are
--
you
are
saying
it
is
invalidated
by
the
mere
fact
of
the
government's
not
having
done
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
no
objection
need
to
be
made
or
can
be
made,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
inconsistent
with
the
answer
you
gave
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
answer
you
gave
me
is
that
automatically
the
guilty
plea
is
washed
out
--
automatically.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
automatically
washed
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
therefore,
he
cannot
--
he
cannot
sit
around
and
wait
to
see
what
happens.
what
happens
is
--
whatever
happens,
it's
invalid.
the
plea
agreement
is
no
good.
you
have
to
have
a
new
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
voidable
--
then
your
answer
to
me
would
be
different.
it's
--
it's
not
void.
it's
voidable,
so
that
he
can
play
dog
in
the
manger
and
wait
and
see
what
happens,
and
then
if
it's
in
interest
that
--
in
his
interest
to
void
it,
he
does.
if
it's
in
his
interest
not
to
void
it,
he
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
plain.
what
about
paragraph
9?
are
you
ignoring
paragraph
9?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
james
puckett
was
indicted
on
one
count
of
armed
bank
robbery
and
one
count
of
using
a
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
a
crime
of
violence.
instead
of
going
to
trial,
he
negotiated
a
plea
bargain
with
the
government.
in
exchange
for
his
guilty
plea
on
each
count,
the
government
agreed
that
puckett
was
entitled
to
a
three-level
reduction
in
offense
level
under
the
sentencing
guidelines
in
recognition
of
his
acceptance
of
responsibility
for
the
crime
spent.
that's
a
basis
for
reducing
the
offense
level.
and
he
also
--
and
the
government
also
agreed
to
ask
the
judge
to
sentence
puckett
at
the
low
end
of
the
applicable
guidelines
range.
however,
before
puckett
was
sentenced
and
while
he
was
on
release,
he
assisted
another
man
in
a
scheme
to
defraud
the
united
states
postal
service.
as
a
result,
the
government
retreated
from
its
earlier
position,
which
had
been
expressed
in
a
motion
before
the
district
court
that
puckett
was
entitled
to
the
three-level
reduction
for
acceptance
of
responsibility.
instead,
the
government
argued
that
no
reduction
was
in
order.
the
district
judge
observing
that
it
was
“so
rare
as
to
be
unknown”
to
give
the
reduction
to
a
defendant
who
had
committed
crimes
subsequent
to
those
for
which
he
was
being
sentenced
declined
to
award
the
reduction.
on
appeal,
puckett
argued
for
the
first
time
that
the
government
had
broken
the
plea
--
the
plea
agreement.
the
government
acknowledged
that
he
had
done
so
but
maintained
that
puckett
was
not
entitled
to
a
remedy
for
the
breach
because
he
had
forfeited
the
claim
by
failing
to
raise
it
before
the
district
court.
indeed,
puckett's
counsel
had
neither
objected
during
sentencing
that
the
government
was
in
violation
of
its
plea
bargain
commitments
nor
had
moved
to
withdraw
puckett's
guilty
plea.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
government
that
the
claim
had
been
forfeited
and
denied
relief
because
puckett
could
not
demonstrate
especially
in
light
of
the
district
judge's
comments
that
the
breach
had
affected
his
ultimate
sentence.
we
granted
certiorari.
if
a
litigant
believes
that
error
has
occurred
in
a
federal
criminal
proceeding,
he
must
object
in
order
to
preserve
the
issue.
unpreserved
claims
cannot
be
pressed
on
appeal
except
to
the
extent
allowed
by
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
52(b).
that
rule
allows
review
if
an
appellant
shows
error
that
was
clear
or
obvious
and
caused
him
prejudice.
the
court
has
discretion
to
correct
such
an
error
if
it
seriously
affected
the
fairness,
integrity
or
reputation
of
the
judicial
proceeding.
this
tough
standard
serves
important
interest
in
judicial
efficiency
by
inducing
timely
objections
which
in
turn
give
district
courts
the
opportunity
to
adjudicate
and
sometimes
to
eliminate
the
--
the
claims
of
error.
that
has
the
effect
of
eliminating
some
unnecessary
appeals,
facilitating
review
in
those
claims
that
do
proceed
to
appeal
and
preventing
litigants
from
playing
dog
in
the
manger,
keeping
silent
until
they
see
that
the
case
goes
against
them
and
then
raising
the
objection.
there
is
no
reason
to
excuse
defendants
whose
plea
agreements
were
broken
by
the
government
from
the
requirement
of
satisfying
this
plain-error
test.
contrary,
puckett
argues
that
the
breach
of
a
plea
agreement
made
his
guilty
plea
unknowing
or
involuntary.
we
think
not,
anymore
than
breach
of
any
other
contract
renders
the
contract
automatically
void.
when
the
government
reneges
on
a
plea
deal,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
seek
a
remedy
perhaps
even
withdrawal
of
his
guilty
plea,
but
the
plea
is
not
retroactively
invalidated,
nor
do
our
prior
cases
resolve
the
matter
in
puckett's
favor,
although
we
have
said
that
preserved
plea
--
a
plea
breach
claims
cannot
be
ignored
as
harmless.
we
have
never
considered
before
whether
unpreserved
plea
breach
claims
must
be
corrected
notwithstanding
the
defendant's
forfeiture.
puckett
is
also
wrong
to
suggest
that
plain-error
review
would
serve
no
purpose
here
and
that
applying
it
would
be
superfluous.
the
salutary
goal
served
by
timely
objections
applies
here
as
elsewhere
and
each
of
the
prongs
of
plain-error
review
has
floors
in
this
context.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
has
joined.
