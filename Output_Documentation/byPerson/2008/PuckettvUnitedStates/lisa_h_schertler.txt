ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
government
breaches
a
plea
agreement,
an
objection
made
in
the
district
court
serves
important
purposes
that
relate
to
the
functioning
of
federal
courts.
it
permits
the
district
court
and
the
parties
to
determine
whether
a
breach
has
occurred,
and
it
also,
in
many
cases,
may
permit
an
immediate
cure
of
that
breach
to
be
administered,
obviating
the
need
for
appellate
review
of
the
issue
altogether.
a
central
purpose
of
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule
is
to
ensure
that
the
district
court
proceedings
are
as
free
of
error
as
possible.
and
that
purpose
is
served
in
this
context,
the
plea
breach
context,
as
it
is
in
others.
rule
52(b)
reinforces
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule
by
placing
a
heavier
burden
on
the
party
who
does
not
object
in
the
district
court
to
win
relief
on
appeal.
the
government's
submission
to
the
court
today
is
that
the
plain-error
standard
does
apply
to
forfeited
claims
that
a
plea
agreement
has
been
breached,
that
the
olano
framework
should
be
followed,
and
that
one
component
of
the
plain-error
showing
in
this
context
should
require
a
defendant
who
did
not
object
to
a
breach
in
the
district
court
to
show
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
outcome
of
the
proceeding
was
affected
by
the
breach.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
well,
i
think
the
result
there
is
controlled
by
santobello.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
i
would
--
i
would
--
i
would
seek
to
distinguish
santobello.
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
there
seemed
to
have
been
multiple
problems
going
on
in
santobello.
and
in
--
and
it
was
unclear
that
the
district
court
in
santobello
even
knew
what
the
terms
of
the
agreement
were.
this
court
--
a
court
in
that
situation
would
have
been
aware
--
would
have
sorted
through
what
the
terms
of
the
agreement
were.
now
--
and
--
and,
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
reason
not
to
apply
harmless
error
review
in
this
context
as
there
is
in
any
other
context.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
well,
there
--
certainly
i
agree,
justice
souter,
that
--
and
although
there
is
distinguishable
facts
in
santobello,
that
that
theme
is
present
in
santobello
as
well.
and
the
court
there
said
that
it
was
not
--
at
the
very
least,
the
court
said
when
the
government
has
not
fulfilled
its
promise
and
an
objection
is
raised
and
the
defendant
has
suffered
an
adverse
consequence
that
was
somehow
related
to
the
government's
broken
promise,
that
the
court
is
not
going
to
find
harmlessness
simply
based
on
the
district
court's
statement
itself
that
it
didn't
rely
on
what
the
government
had
said.
now,
we
would
submit,
however,
that
there
could
be
cases
--
and
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
would
have
one
of
those
--
where
even
in
a
setting
where
an
objection
is
raised,
if
the
defendant
receives
the
benefit
that
was
the
aim
of
the
promise
he
secured
from
the
government
--
for
instance,
if
in
santobello
the
defendant
there
received
the
lowest
possible
sentence
that
he
might
have
gotten
--
that
in
that
circumstance,
santobello
should
not
preclude
harmless
error
review,
and
the
defendant
cannot
be
said
to
have
--
to
be
in
jail
having
not
received
the
benefit.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
yes,
justice
souter.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
yes.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
i
agree
that
is
--
that
is
the
strong
suggestion
of
santobello
when
there
has
been
an
objection
made.
we
would
--
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
analysis
must
differ
when
no
objection
is
made
in
the
district
court.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
the
high
value
that
the
court
placed
on
the
liberty
interest
in
that
situation
would
also
have
to
be
to
the
exclusion
of
other
very
important
interests
that
are
served
by
making
sure
that
objections
are
raised
in
the
district
court.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
i
--
and
--
but
i
also
would
add
on
to
that
that
i
don't
think
it
is
only
efficiency,
that
that
is
the
sole
interest
that
would
be
sacrificed
by
an
--
by
an
absolutist
approach,
really,
that
your
honor
has
suggested.
there
also
would
be
interests,
fairness
interests,
that
would
be
compromised
by
that
rule,
because
just
a
rule
that--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--yes,
yes.
the
rule
that
petitioner
proposes,
for
example,
is
that
when
a
government
breach
occurs,
one
need
not
object
in
the
district
court,
one
may
raise
it
on
direct
appeal
and
one
automatically
gets
to
elect
to
withdraw
the
plea.
that
would
create
incentives
on
the
part
of
defendants
to
--
to
withhold
objections.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
well--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--because
this
court
has
the
--
what
it
permits
is
manipulation
of
the
system
by
--
by
counsel,
really.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
oh,
we
did
acquiesce,
yes.
yes,
justice
stevens.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
the--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--well,
but
this
--
this
is
the
question
on
which
the
circuits
had
divided,
and
which
is
why
we
acquiesced
in
this
case
to
sort
through
that
question.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
well,
i
think
that
the
analysis
of
a
breach
in
each
case
will
differ
and
it
first
and
it
will
in
the
--
first
and
foremost
depend
upon
what
the
standard
of
appellate
review
is
and
whether
an
objection
has
preserved,
in
which
case
it
would
be
the
government's
burden
to
show
that
a
breach
is
harmless,
or
in
the
plain-error
sentencings
the
--
the
burdens
are
reversed;
and
we
think
the
--
the
ordinary
rules
codified
in
rule
52(a)
and
(b)
apply
in
this
context
equally.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
so
rare
as
to
be
unknown.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
yes.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
the
--
let
me
respond
to
that
immediate
point.
which
is
--
my
response
would
be,
yes,
if
the
government
were
to
recommend
that
he
received
acceptance
of
responsibility
in
this
situation,
that
may
be
considered
significant;
but
the
district
court
judge
would
also
know
that
it
was
in
fulfillment
of
a
promise
that
was
made
before
renewed
criminal
activity
occurred
from
jail.
and
so,
given
that
circumstance--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--and
here
under
the
plain
error
standard
it
was
the
defendant's
burden
to
show
a
reasonable
probability
that
something
different
would
have
happened.
the
court
of
appeals
made
findings
on
this
record
that
the
record
showed
that
nothing
different
would
have
happened,
even
had
the
government
complied
with
its
promise.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
well,
the
--
the
government
has
conceded,
and
i
don't--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--that
is
a
possible
outcome,
justice
breyer,
and
clarification
for
--
from
this
court
that
the
plain-error
standard
does
apply
to
this
type
of
error
as
it
does
to
others
would
certainly
help
to
resolve
the
conflict
that
does
exist
out
there
in
the
courts
of
appeal.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
yes.
yes,
chief
justice.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
yes.
the
--
it
does
not
give
the
courts
all
of
the
guidance
that
would
be
helpful
as
to
how
to
apply
other
components
of
the
plain-error
standard
in
this
context.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
well,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
mean,
what
--
the
reason
that
this
case
seemed
to
us
a
good
vehicle
to
address
these
questions
is
that
they
was
agreement
throughout
the
appellate
process
that
there
was
an
error
that
was
plain
and,
therefore,
it
provides
an
opportunity
to
address
--
if
the
court
chooses,
which
it
need
not,
but
if
the
court
chooses
--
to
address
how
the
substantial
rights
aspect
of
the
plain-error
standard
and
discretionary
aspect--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--well,
justice
stevens,
what
one
finds
when
one
looks
through
a
lot
of
these
--
when
these
cases
are
brought,
there
often
is
a
dispute
and
a
real
--
and
a
genuine
dispute
as
to
whether
a
breach
has
occurred
or
not.
and
those
cases,
of
course,
do
not
allow
exposition
--
explanation
about
the
other
components.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
as
we
acknowledge
in
our
brief,
there
might
be
arguments
out
there
that
there
were
implicit
terms
to
this
plea
agreement
that
were
breached
by
the
defendant.
those
arguments
were
never
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
and
so
we
are
accepting
that
record
as
a
way--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--well,
i
mean
--
as
i've
--
as
i've
already
indicated,
having
the
court
state
that
the
--
rule
52(b)
applies
here
is
a
--
is
a
--
i
think,
a
helpful--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--the
--
paragraph
9
indicates
that
the
government
agrees
to
request
that
puckett's
sentence
placed
at
the
lowest
end
of
the
guideline
levels
deemed
applicable
by
the
court.
and
there
has
been
no
claim,
at
any
point
in
this
proceeding,
that
that
provision
has
been
breached.
what
happened
at
the
sentencing
was
that
the
district
court
stated
on
the
record:
i
know
that
there
is
an
agreement
in
here
that
that
the
lowest
end
of
the
guideline
is
appropriate,
and
i
intend
to
follow
that.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
well,
i
--
i
guess
that
it's
a
matter
of
some
disagreement,
but
--
i
mean,
we
have
--
we
have
taken
the
position
that
this
was
a
breach
of
the
government's
agreement
that
he
qualified
for
a
three-level
reduction
in
his
offense
level.
that
was
the--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--well,
we
breached
the
agreement
by
not
doing
what
we
said
we
would
do,
and
the
question
we
would
submit
to
the
court
is
whether,
given
the
absence
of
an
objection,
petitioner
carried
his
burden
of
showing
that
we
did
prejudice
him.
and
the--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--because
in
the
plain-error
setting,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
burdens
shift
and
that,
under
the
third
component
of
that
standard,
it
is
the
defendant's
burden,
if
he
did
not
object,
to
show
an
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
proceeding,
that
his
substantial
rights
were
violated.
and
here
--
and
i
would
note
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
findings
that
the
result
would
have
been
the
same,
and
petitioner
in
this
court
has
never
challenged
those
findings
on
this
record.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
the
--
paragraph
8
of
the
plea
agreement
indicates
that
the
government--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--well,
we
indicated
to
the
district
court
that
petitioner
did
not
qualify
for
acceptance
of
responsibility.
and
paragraph
8
was
a
government
agreement
that
he
did
qualify
for
acceptance
of
responsibility.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
that's
correct.
and
there
was
--
and
there
an
intervening
event,
obviously,
that
affected
the
judgment,
but
because
the
explicit
provision
of
this
particular
plea
agreement,
which
i
agree
is
atypical,
as
the
government's
motion
for
the
third
point
made
clear,
did
not
have
a
qualification
in
there.
and
that
--
that
is
the
base
--
i
mean,
i
don't
mean
to
be
arguing
strenuously
that
the
government
did
something
wrong
here,
because
there
were
--
but
the
fact
is,
given
the
terms
of
this
plea
agreement,
there
--
that
is
the
basis
for
our
concession
that
there
was
a
breach.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
absolutely,
justice
ginsburg,
and
if
there
had
been
an
objection
based
on
that
provision
of
the
plea
agreement,
that
may
have
been
very
well
what
would
have
happened.
the
breach
could
have
been
cured.
and
the
fact
is
that,
in
the
absence
of
that
objection,
the
breach
was
not
cured
when
it
could
have
been,
and
that
is
one
reason
--
that
is
why
it
makes
sense
to
apply
the
plain-error
standard
in
this
context.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
well,
there
would
be
more
than
one
way
to
cure
a
breach
such
as
this,
if
an
objection
had
been
raised
in
the
district
court.
one
way
would
have
been
by
the
correction
on
the
record
that
we
have
just
discussed,
but
another
way--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--but
if
the
defendant
--
and
if
the
defendant
said
that,
that
would
be
a
silly
way
to
correct
it.
it
also
could
have
been
sent
to
another
judge
for
resentencing,
just
as
the
court
in
santobello
said,
that
a
remedy
could
be
accomplished.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
the
probation
officer
said
that.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
yes.
and
i
don't
think
petitioner
--
petitioner
even
contends
that
he
is
entitled
now
--
or
he
contends
he
is
entitled
to
get
out
of
this
plea.
but
taking
the
more
typical
remedies
that
this
court
proposed
as
one
possibility
in
santobello,
i
don't
think
petitioner
would
say
that
a
judge
should
not
know
that
he
did
--
that
he
engaged
in
subsequent
criminal
conduct.
that
is
information
that
any
judge
sentencing
him
must
know
about
in
order
to
fairly
assess
what
sentence
he
should
receive.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
well
--
and
again,
i
guess
i
would
give
the
same
response,
that
it
--
it
is
petitioner's
burden
to
show
a
likelihood,
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
it
would
have
been
different.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
yes,
justice
souter.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
it
could,
justice
souter.
and
if
the
court
were
to
take
that
position,
we
would
argue
that
there
is
still,
under
the
plain-error
standard,
the
fourth
component,
the
discretionary
component--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--it
was
not
correct,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
the
defense
attorney
made
that
correction,
and
the
--
and
the
judge
accepted
that.
and
if
i
could
go
back--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--he
--
not
at
the
time
of
these
proceedings.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
that's
right.
another
--
another
defendant
had
pled
guilty
to
this
crime,
and
the
factual
statement
supporting
his
plea
had
implicated
petitioner
as
having
instigated
the
crime,
suggested
to--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--he
admitted
the
allegations
to
the
probation
officer,
and
that
is
what
was
reflected
in
the
presentence
report.
and
if
i
could
return
to
justice
souter's
question
about
if
the
court
were
to
take
the
position
that
a
form
of
substantial
rights
is
affected
in
every
case
of
a
government
breach
of
plea
agreement,
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
as
this
court
analyzed
a
similar
type
of
difficult
question
in
johnson
and
cotton,
that
the
fourth
discretionary
component
of
the
standard
should
preclude
relief
or
should
at
least
give
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
discretion
to
not
grant
relief
where,
as
in
this
case,
there
has
been
no
showing
that
there
was
an
effect
on
the
outcome,
and,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
an
affirmative
record
that
the
outcome
would
have
been
exactly
the
same.
thank
you,
your
honors.
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
