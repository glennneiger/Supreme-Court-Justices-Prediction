justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
essentially
two
questions.
you
mentioned
the
fact
that
this
is
not
--
this
is
an
unusual
agreement,
and
that
some
of
the
provisions
were
negotiated
and
the
record
shows
they
were
--
they
were
deliberately
undertaken.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
was
probably
a
scrivener's
error.
the
normal
--
most
plea
agreements
would
include
a
provision
that
if
the
defendant
engaged
in
unlawful
conduct,
all
bets
are
off.
and
my
hunch
was
that
somebody
just
forgot
to
put
the
boilerplate
language
in
the
agreement.
is
that
fair
to
say?
i
can't
imagine
the
government
negotiating
an
agreement
that
doesn't
include
that
clause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
going
back
to
my
question,
isn't
it
a
likely
explanation
for
the
defendant's
lawyer's
failure
to
object
that
he
just
didn't
realize
this
agreement
didn't
have
this
normal
provision
in
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand
that.
but
the
other
thing
i
wanted
to
ask
you:
you
keep
using
the
term
"void".
do
our
cases
say
that
any
breach
of
a
plea
agreement
renders
it
void
rather
than
subject
to
some
kind
of
other
remedy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
those
are
cases
that
say
that
the
remedy
is
setting
aside
the
--
the
guilty
plea,
but
they
don't
characterize
the
--
the
agreement
as
having
become
void,
if
i
--
if
i
remember
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
those
--
that
goes
to
the
integrity
of
the
guilty
plea,
not
to
whether
or
not
the
underlying
contract
became
void,
i
think.
maybe
i'm
missing
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
kind
of
conceptual
question?
is
it
your
view
that
a
breach
of
a
plea
agreement
can
never
be
concluded
to
be
harmless
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
labels
like
"plain
error"
and
"structural".
but
if
in
fact
it's
totally
harmless
and
everybody
agrees
it's
harmless,
would
the
government
still
have
to
--
or
would
there
be
an
adverse
consequence
nevertheless?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
there
could
never
be
harmless
error,
harmless
breach
of
a
plea
agreement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
talking
about
manipulation
of
the
system.
i
just
wonder
if
the
government
wasn't
manipulating
the
system
when
they
said
we
should
grant
cert
in
this
case.
you
did
--
you
did
agree
that
the
cert
should
be
granted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
are
you
taking
the
position
that
--
that
every
case,
that
the
absence
of
objection
would
always
be
controlling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
example,
in
this
particular
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
--
if
you
had
an
objection
and
if
the
judge
had
agreed
with
the
objection
and
said
i
will
set
aside
the
plea
because
of
adopting
the
arguments
of
your
opponent,
i
think
the
government
would
have
appealed,
and
said
that
that
decision
is
so
wrong
and
it's
because
it's
really
harmless
error.
i
think
here
the
real
question
is
whether
there's
harmless
error
available,
rather
than
turning
anything
on
whether
or
not
an
objection
was
made
in
the
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
talking
about
the
division
of
the
circuits,
do
you
think
all
breaches
of
--
of
plea
agreements
should
be
governed
by
precisely
the
same
standard?
or
do
you
think
there
are
varying
facts
in
different
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
has
tried
to
pick
a
case
in
which
it
has
the
strongest
opportunity
to
win
on
the
merits
in
order
to
have
us
decide
a
rule
that
really
isn't
important
in
a
lot
of
other
cases,
but
it
is
totally
unimportant
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
don't
you
think
it
would
have
been
open
to
the
government
to
make
the
argument
that
justice
breyer
has
made
and
said
there
really
wasn't
a
breach
here,
at
least
an
insignificant
breach
that
should
be
ignored?
