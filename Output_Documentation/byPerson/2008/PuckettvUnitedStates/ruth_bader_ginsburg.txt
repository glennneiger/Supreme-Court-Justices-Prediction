mr.
isaacson,
you
said
there
were
two
facts.
aren't
there
three?
isn't
it
a
fact
that
after
the
plea
bargain
the
defendant
in
essence
broke
his
side
of
the
bargain
by
committing
a
crime
while
he
was
in
jail?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
judge
said
--
and
he
was
open
in
his
thinking.
he
said:
"unheard
to
me
that
i
would
give
acceptance
of
responsibility
credit
to
someone
that
as
soon
as
he
gets
sent
to
jail
is
out
there
committing
another
crime.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
judge
did
say
that.
he
said
it
was
unknown
to
him
that
judges
give
acceptance
of
responsibility
credit
to
someone
who
in
the
interval
between
the
plea
and
when
he
shows
up
in
court
for
sentencing
commits
another
crime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
could
have,
if
he
felt
that
way
--
i
mean,
there
they
were
in
the
courtroom;
all
of
them
knew
about
the
plea
agreement
because
there
had
been
the
rule
11
colloquy
when
it
was
taken,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
the
plea
was
taken--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was
the
same
judge,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
they
were
all
there
and
the
defendant
was
asked
all
these
questions,
and
the
government
--
and
the
judge
knew
about
the
government's
side
of
the
plea
bargain.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
was
not
a
secret
to
anyone
that
the
government
said
it
would
ask
for
the
extra
acceptance
of
responsibility
credit.
and
yet
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer
stand
there
and
they
don't
say
a
word:
wait
a
minute,
judge.
they
didn't
object
at
--
there
was
no
motion
to
withdraw
the
plea,
was
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--before
the
judge
there
was
no
plea
to
withdraw
the
plea.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
that's
why
we
are
--
if
he
had
asked
to
withdraw
the
plea,
then
we'd
have
a
different
case.
but
he
didn't,
so
we
are
here
on
plain-error
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
santobello
was
a
case
where
there
was
a
timely
objection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
relief
are
you
seeking
now?
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
ask
to
withdraw
the
plea
when
you
were
before
the
sentencing
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
would
expose
him
to
a
considerably
greater
penalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
did
include
it
in
the
motion,
didn't
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there
a
motion--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
credit
for
acceptance
of
responsibility,
and
had
as
a
condition
that
the
defendant
be
law-abiding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
isn't
it
odd
that
the
--
that
these
documents
both
meant
to
serve
the
same
purpose,
one
has
the
provision
for
law-abiding
conduct
in
the
future
and
the
other
doesn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
part
of
this
agreement
that
was
honored.
in
fact,
the
judge
after
having
said
that,
i
never
heard
of
giving
credit
for
responsibility
to
somebody
who
commits
a
crime
in
the
interim,
but
he
said:
i
understand
there
was
an
agreement
to
sentence
at
the
low
end,
and
that's
what
i'm
going
to
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
you
say
what
you
want
is
a
trial,
the
defendant
would
be
exposed
to
not
just
the
upper
level;
plus
weren't
there
add-ones
in
this
case
that
the
judge
ordered
to
be
served
concurrently
rather
than
consecutively?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
wouldn't
someone
read
what
happened
here
as
the
defendant
saying,
well,
i
didn't
get
the
acceptance
credit,
but
the
judge
is
still
sentencing
me
at
the
low
end,
and
he's
still
making
the
sentences
run
concurrently,
so
i
think
--
why,
if
he
doesn't
try
to
withdraw
the
plea,
why
isn't
it
the
logical
assumption
that
he
says
i
didn't
get
the
whole
promise
but
i
got
part
of
it,
and
i'll
take
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
we
know
this
one
didn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
a
matter
of
practice
among
u.s.
attorneys,
we
do
have
six
and
a
half
years
at
stake
here,
right?
that's
the
difference
between
the
two
levels?
why
wouldn't
it
be
the
appropriate
thing
for
the
u.s.
attorney,
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney,
to
say,
"judge,
i
want
to
call
your
attention
to
paragraph
8
of
the
plea
agreement.
"
"at
the
time
we
entered
into
it,
we
made
that
undertaking.
"
and
so
then
everybody
is
sure
that
the
judge's
mind
is
focused
on
that.
wouldn't
that
be
the
better
practice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
sent
to
another
judge,
that
judge
would
still
have
the
presentence
report.
after
all,
it
wasn't
the
government
that
initiated
reneging
on
the
--
if
it
was
the
--
it
was
the
presentence
report.
and
before
the
government
said
a
word,
the
judge
had
read
and
was
discussing
the
presentence
report,
which
said,
judge,
earlier,
we
said
you
should
give
credit
for
acceptance
of
responsibilities,
now
we
must
tell
you,
you
should
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
