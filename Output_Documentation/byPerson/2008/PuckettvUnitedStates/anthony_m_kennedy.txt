justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
want
to
us
make
the
inference
that
the
impermissible
or
criminal
activity
was
permitted
by
the
absence
of
this
specific
clause.
you
say
there
is
no
implied
condition,
no
implied
covenant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
questions
so
far
indicate
that
one
of
the
promises
was
an
implied
promise
that
you
will
keep
the
terms
of
the
agreement
by
lawful
behavior.
so
that
just
--
what
you
say
just
begs
the
question.
now,
i
recognize
the
government
has
conceded
a
breach,
and
we
will
probably
move
on
from
that
point.
but,
as
justice
scalia
indicates,
it
puts
the
case
in
a
very
artificial
posture,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
the
law
of
contracts
i
assume
--
i
haven't
looked
it
up
yet
--
that
you
can't
rescind
for
a
nonmaterial
breach.
a
trivial
breach
doesn't
always
allow
recision.
and
isn't
it
trivial
if
the
district
court
said:
you
know,
i
don't
care
if
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
the
solicitor
general
himself
both
came
into
the
court
on
their
hands
and
knees
begging
me
to
do
this.
i
wouldn't
do
this.
i
wouldn't
give
you
an
increase.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
seems
to
me
an
immaterial
breach,
other
than
as
to
one
level
--
and
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong.
i
take
it
as
to
level
one
--
or
as
to
the
third
level,
they
need
the
recommendation
before
they
have
the
authority
to
reduce.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
some
instances
in
which
the
--
the
prosecution
must
make
the
recommendation
before
the
district
judge
has
the
authority
to
depart
downward,
am
i
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
right.
so
--
so
this
--
this
district
judge,
i
take
it,
did
not
have
the
authority
to
go
down
by
--
by
a
third
without
the
recommendation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
as
to
the
third
level,
the
district
judge
said,
you
know,
i
will
assume
that
they
have
made
the
argument.
i
will
assume
they
have
made
the
argument.
i
wouldn't
hear
the
--
i
--
i
wouldn't
grant
--
i
wouldn't
follow
the
recommendation.
i
am
not
going
to
depart
downward
even
assuming
the
government
--
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
--
the
government's
breach
is
immaterial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
reading
of
santobello
is
the
same
as
yours
on
that
point,
and
it's
difficult
for
me
to
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
take
it
--
you
never
really
answered
justice
alito's
question.
i
take
it
that
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
can
knowingly
recognize
that
an
error
is
being
committed,
say
nothing,
listen
to
the
sentence,
and
then
object
later.
that's
your
position,
yes
or
no?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
to
explore
the
issue
of
breach
for
a
moment,
suppose
hypothetically,
same
facts
here,
but
it
is
all
vented
and
discussed
and
aired
and
objected
to
in
the
district
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
defense
attorney
says,
well,
now,
if
you
look
at
paragraph
8
and
so
forth,
and
the
government
says,
well,
your
honor,
well,
he
committed
another
crime.
and
then
the
judge
says
--
and
we
are
not
going
to
move
for
the
recommendation.
and
the
judge
says:
i
will
assume
that
you
made
the
recommendation,
and
i
will
just
tell
you
right
now
i
wouldn't
take
the
recommendation
anyway.
i'm
not
going
--
i
wouldn't
give
a
lowered
sentence
even
if
you
made
the
objection.
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it?
because
in
santobello
there
was
no
reason
given
for
the
prosecutor
to
violate
the
plea
agreement.
here
there's
a
good
reason.
can
you
distinguish
santobello
on
that
basis?
