chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
07-9712,
puckett
v.
united
states.
mr.
isaacson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
there
is
nothing
theoretically
inconsistent
with
the
government
--
you
can
feel
remorse.
i
mean,
you're
not
going
to
do
it
again.
you
going
to
feel
remorse
every
time
you
do
it,
but
that
doesn't
mean
he
didn't
feel
remorse
from
the
crime
he
was
pleading
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
justice
ginsburg's
point
is
relevant,
though,
on
the
question
of
prejudice.
if
the
judge
gets
up
there
and
says,
i
don't
care
what
the
government
says,
i
am
not
going
to
give
anybody
a
departure
when
they
have
committed
another
crime,
then
you
haven't
been
prejudiced
by
the
government's
breach.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
not
be
cost-free
for
you,
because
if
you
just
sit
there
and
say,
you
know,
the
agreement
is
void,
the
government
is
going
to
say,
well,
fine,
i
will
see
you
in
court;
and
we
will
have
a
trial;
and
you
are
going
to
get
twice
as
much
as
you
would
have
gotten
anyway.
you
have
some
interest,
since
you
entered
the
guilty
plea,
in
going
forward
with
the
plea.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
let's
put
it
this
way.
maybe
this
is
the
same
question
anyway.
let's
say
it
is
the
same
facts
as
we
have
here
but
instead
of
saying,
i
can't
do
this,
the
judge
says,
i'm
going
to
do
this.
and,
look,
i
think
you
are
remorseful.
i'm
going
to
give
you
three
points.
and
that's
all
you
agreed
with
the
government.
the
government
says
we'll
recommend
it,
and
the
judge
says,
well,
you're
going
to
get
it
anyway.
i
think
you
should
get
it.
the
agreement
has
still
been
breached,
right?
the
government
didn't
recommend.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
in
that
situation,
you
think
you
can
withdraw
the
agreement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
we
will
give
you
a
couple
minutes
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
schertler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
clear,
isn't
it,
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
in
fact
prejudiced?
the
judge
--
judge
sanders
said
it's
very
rare,
he
said,
that
you
would
depart
--
or
i
forget
whether
it's
depart
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
rare
--
i
thought
he
said
"rare
to
unknown",
"to
be
unknown"
--
you
are
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
suspect
it's
probably
rarer
still
for
the
government
to
recommend
that.
so
you
can't
really
say
that
he
wouldn't
have
done
this
or
he
certainly
wouldn't
have
considered
it.
it's
one
thing
to
say
i've
never
heard
of
that.
it's
another
thing
when
one
of
your
colleagues
is
there
saying,
this
is
what
you
should
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
but
none
of
us
can
know
what
the
judge
would
have
done.
i
mean,
we
have
had
cases
here
where
the
government's
recommendation
of
downward
departures
has
been
pretty
surprising
to
me
as
well,
and
it's
because
they
were
informants
or
whatever
and
they
have
engaged
in
some
pretty
bad
conduct;
and
i
don't
know
what
judge
sanders
would
have
done.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
may
have
gotten
lost
in
the
dialogue.
as
you
understand
it,
justice
breyer's
suggestion
was
that
you
win,
right?
you
get
plain
error,
and
then
sometimes
you
apply
it
and
it
comes
out
one
way,
and
sometimes
you
apply
it
the
other.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
are
happy
to
go
along
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
a
big
difference,
right?
as
you
said
earlier,
harmless
error,
the
government
has
the
burden;
plain
error,
the
defendant
has
the
burden.
that's
certainly
going
to
change
how
you
approach
however
many
different
factual
contexts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
there
has
been
a
breach
here.
and
it's
not
fanciful
to
say
he
felt
remorse
and
then
he
went
and
did
it
again.
that
happens
all
the
time.
you
know,
when
i
have
a
rich
dessert
i
shouldn't
have,
i
feel
bad
about
it
afterwards.
it
doesn't
mean
i
will
not
do
it
again.
i
mean,
why
isn't
that
the
case
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
can
put
that
before
the
judge.
you
are
supposed
to
go
there
and
say,
"look,
we
agreed
to
recommend
it
and
we
do
recommend
it.
"
you
could
say,
"and
by
the
way,
you
should
know
that
he's
gone
out
and
done
this
again.
"
but
you
most
--
you
certainly
prejudiced
him
by
not
doing
what
you
said
you
would
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
isn't
it
the
fact
that
we
can
never
know
what
judge
sanders
would
have
done
if
the
government
had
what
it
said
it
would
do.
and
because
--
why
shouldn't
you
bear
the
burden
of
showing
there
is
no
prejudice
when
you
can't
tell
because
you're
the
one
that
breached
the
agreement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
judge
sanders
would
look
at
this
kind
of
the
way
that
we
have
been
discussing
it,
and
he
would
look
and
say,
boy,
it's
--
it's
--
he
committed
subsequent
conduct,
how
can
you
recommend
that
i
depart?
he
says,
but
on
the
other
hand,
every
plea
agreement
i
have
seen
you
always
say
if
he
commits
subsequent
conduct
that
is
illegal,
that
all
bets
are
the
off.
you
didn't
say
that
here,
so
i'm
going
to
take
the
recommendation
seriously.
i
don't
think
it's
--
maybe
i
am
repeating
myself,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
at
all
clear
that
the
result
wouldn't
be
different
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
wasn't
--
was
he
convicted
of
this
new
crime?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was
just
an
allegation,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
did
we
assume
anything
anyway?
i
assume
he
denies
the
allegations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
isaacson,
why
don't
you
take
two
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-9712,
puckett
versus
united
states.
