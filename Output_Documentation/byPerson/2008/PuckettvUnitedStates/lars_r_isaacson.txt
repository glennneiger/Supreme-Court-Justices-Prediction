mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
framed
by
two
major
facts:
jimmy
puckett
pled
guilty
and
waived
his
fundamental
right
to
trial
in
exchange
for
a
promise
by
the
government
that
they
agreed
he
was
qualified
for
a
three-level
reduction
in
his
offense
level;
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
breached
this
promise.
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
this
situation
are
instructive.
for
a
plea
to
be
valid,
it
must
be
voluntary
and
intelligent.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
no,
your
honor.
he
did
not
breach
the
plea
agreement
by
doing
that.
he--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--the
government
in
this
case
drafted
a
plea
agreement,
and
most
plea
agreements
--
i've
practiced
in
the
northern
district
of
texas
quite
often,
and
virtually
every
plea
agreement
has
a
provision
in
it
that
says
if
the
defendant
does
some
type
of
criminal
activity,
thus
it
will
render
it
void.
this
plea
agreement
did
not
have
that
in
it.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
so
it's
different
than
most
plea
agreements.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
well,
i'm
not
--
what
we
are
saying
is
the
government
needs
to
obey
the
promise
in
the
plea
agreement.
the
promise
in
the
plea
agreement
is--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--it
is
--
well,
it
is
up
to
the
judge
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
defendant
gets
the
acceptance
points
or
not.
the
bargain
here
was
not
that
mr.
puckett
would
get
the
points,
but
that
the
government
would
agree
that
he
was
qualified
to
receive
those
points.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
yes,
3e1.1.
there
is
a
number
of
different
factors
that
go
into
whether
or
not
someone
gets
the
acceptance
points.
it
is
the
judge's
discretion
to
give
those
points
and
there
are
a
number
of
different
factors
that
go
into
it.
certainly
the
termination
of
criminal
activity
is
one
1
of
those
factors
the
court
looks
at,
but
it's
not
the
only
one.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
that
is
what
judge--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--that
is
what
judge
sanders
did
say.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
well,
the
position--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--yes.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
the
plea
agreement
did
not
say
the
government
had
to
get
up
there
and
make
a
statement
at
sentencing
that
he
was
supposed
to
get
his
points.
they
just
agreed
he
was
entitled
to
his
acceptance
points.
there
was
two
parts
of
the
plea
agreement.
the
first
part
that
they
agreed
to
was,
you
know,
that
he
was
entitled
to
those
points;
and
the
second
part
was
that
they
would
recommend
at
sentencing
that
he
get
the
lower
in
the
guideline
range.
the
first
part
was
not
--
did
not
say
they
had
to
get
up
there
and
say
that.
they
chose
on
their
own
to
get
up
there
and
breach
the
plea
agreement
by
saying,
he's
not
entitled
to
those
points.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
it's
page
54a
of
the
joint
appendix
volume
1,
paragraphs
8
and
9.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
well
--
i
believe
he
has
been
prejudiced
by
the
government's
breach,
because
once
the
government
violates
the
plea
agreement
on
the
first
level,
as
we
know
under
the
prior
precedents
of
this
case,
it
makes
the
actual
plea
agreement
void.
and
secondly,
the
santobello
case
clearly
talks
about
it
is
not
important
the
effect
on
the
sentencing
judge
what
the
--
in
santobello
the
government
breached
a
plea
agreement
and
the
judge
said:
it
doesn't
matter
the
government
breached
the
plea
agreement;
i
would
have
done
the
same
thing
anyway;
it
makes
no
difference.
this
court
said
specifically
that's
not
relevant.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
correct.
i
guess
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
the
agreement
here
was
not
that
judge
sanders
would
give
him
acceptance
points.
the
fact
is
the
government
made
the
position
--
and
i
should
point
out
that
mr.
puckett,
he
gave
up
all
his
rights
just
for
this
slim
reed
of
hope.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
i'm
sorry,
ma'am.
i
didn't--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--yes.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
yes,
judge
sanders.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
right,
yes.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
mr.
puckett
had
made
a
motion
prior
to
the
sentencing
to
withdraw
his
plea
on
his
own.
he
basically
pro
se
had
done
that.
but
not--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
during
the
sentencing,
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
our
point
is
that
we
suggest
plain
error
shouldn't
be
applied
to
this
case.
this
court
in
santobello
said
35
years
ago
when
the
government
breaches
a
plea
agreement
it
can
never
stand.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
that
is
correct,
but
the
principles
of
whether
or
not
when
the
government
breaches
a
plea
agreement
that
renders
the
underlying
conviction
void
raises
it
to
a
different
level.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
i
would
suggest
it
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
whether
or
not
he
actually
pled.
justice
ginsburg's
raised
a
great
point
about
what
judge
sanders
did
in
this
case.
he
was
long
involved.
the
promises
in
the
plea
agreement
were
talked
about.
mr.
puckett
had
every
right
to
rely
upon
those
promises
when
he
foreclosed
his
right
to
jury
trial,
his
right
to
present
witnesses
on
his
own
behalf.
this
is
a
solemn--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--i
would
suggest
this
court's
precedent
is
that
it
has
to
be
a
knowing
waiver
of
his
rights,
that
promises
that
are
unfulfilled
or
unfulfillable
render
the
plea
itself
void.
the
constitutional
due
process
overtones
or
overpinnings
of
a
plea
agreement
as
opposed
to
a
normal
contract
makes
this
different.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
we
request
--
what
relief
do
i
want?
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
mr.
puckett
would
like
the
plea
agreement
to
be
set
aside
and
be
allowed
to
take
this
case
to
trial.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
potentially,
yes.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
we
believe--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--we
believe
that
the
action
of
the
government,
again,
rendered
the
plea
agreement
itself
void,
without
value,
and
he
would
--
mr.
puckett--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--certainly
that
is
a
remedy
some
circuits
have
used.
why
that
is
not
effective,
we
believe
the
defendant
should
have
the
right
to
be
able
to
choose.
when
it
reaches
this
level,
the
plea
agreement
is
void.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
i
certainly
can't
put
myself
on
the
sides
back
then.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
it's
unusual.
the
government
in
its
breach
--
sorry
--
in
its
brief
indicated
it
could
have
included
it
in
there.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
it
was--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--yes.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
yes,
that
was
included
in
the
motion
filed
the
next
day
for
the
additional
point,
that
is
correct.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
well,
one
is
a
plea
agreement
that
is
entered
in
open
court
with
the
defendant
present
with
his
attorney
and
the
second
is
a
motion
filed
by
the
united
states
attorney
the
day
after.
so
they
are
different.
certainly
they
have
different,
i
would
suggest,
importance.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
i
--
i
can't.
as
to
whether
--
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
--
this
is
a
--
normally,
these
are
normally
included
in
these
agreements,
i
would
suggest
to
you.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
but
i
would
suggest
to
you
also
that
it
was
not
included
in
this
agreement,
and
since
the
government
drafted
it
i
don't
think
we
can
just
assume
it
should
be
there.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
well,
if
it
is
--
i
think
the
language
of
--
of
brady
--
certainly
a
plea
must
stand
unless
it
is
induced
by
misrepresentation,
unfulfilled
or
unfulfillable
promises.
recently
in
the
bousley,
case:
statements
in
there
can't
go;
not
good
if
it's
induced
by
misrepresentation;
machibroda--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--well,
again,
i
am
--
citing
from
machibroda:
a
guilty
plea,
if
induced
by
promises
or
threats
which
would
deprive
it
of
a
private
or
voluntary
act
are
void.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
well,
i
--
i
think
what
we
are
saying
is
once
the
government
takes
its
action,
it
deprives
the
plea
of
its
voluntary
character.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
no,
but
i
would
suggest
that
santobello
again
talks
about
the
intent,
whether
or
not
--
in
that
case
there
were
two
prosecutors
who
didn't
know
what
one
--
the
other
one
was
doing,
and
this
court
said
that's
not
important;
it
is
the
integrity
of
the
plea
that's
important
and
the
government's
breach
thereof.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
well--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--i'm
sorry
--
i
am
missing
--
what
are
you
talking
about?
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
i
--
i
--
i
am
sorry.
for
the
downward
departure
and
acceptance
of
responsibility,
they
are
different.
for
the
first
two
points,
it
can
be
done
in
the
plea
agreement.
the
third
has
to
be
done
by
the
prosecution.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
well,
the
government
filed
a
motion.
i
don't
know
if
they
officially
had
withdrawn
it
or
not.
i
know
at
sentencing
they
argued
against
it,
so
--
i
am
not
sure
if
the
judge
had
the
power
to
or
not.
the
motion
was
already
on
file.
the
government
had
already
asked
for
that.
now,
they
changed
their
mind.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
well,
in
terms
of
materiality
of
the
breach,
in
santobello
there
are
those
exact
words:
the
government
is
in
a
very
poor
position
to
talk
materiality
after
they've
breached
the
agreement.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
that's
correct.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
yes,
there
were
three
underlying
federal
charges
that
he
was
on
supervisory
release
for
that
the
judge
ran
concurrently
with
the
sentence
in
this
case.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
i
think
there
are
two
parts
to
your
question,
your
honor,
if
i
could
address
them.
in
regard
to
a
de
minimus
breach
of
the
plea
agreement,
we
recognize
that
technical
defects
in
a
plea
agreement
may
not
always
require
automatic
reversal.
however,
the
government
must
always
fulfill
completely
the
promises
they
have
made
in
the
agreement.
and
that
goes
to
the
difference
between
a
--
a
plea
agreement
is
being
different
than
a
normal
contract.
in
a
normal
contract,
you
think
of
a
--
an
exxon
merging
with
mobil,
things
of
that
nature.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
government's
--
the
obligations
in
the
plea
agreement
for
the
vast
majority
are
on
the
defendant,
what
he
has
to
do.
he
gives
up
his
rights.
he
must
cooperate,
things
of
that
nature.
as
on
page
51a
shows,
the
government's
agreements
are
extremely
small.
there's
only
two
paragraphs.
and
that's
normally
how
it
is.
our
position
is
if
the
government
breaches
its
promises,
that's
when
it
must
be
reversed.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
well--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--no.
i'm
--
what
i'm
saying
is
the
threshold
of
whether
there
is
a
breach
or
not
--
the
question
has
been
posed
of
whether
or
not
every
single
breach
is
automatic
reversal.
we
--
we
recognize
that
there
may
be
some
that
have
absolutely
no
basis
or
do
not
really
imply
or
go
into
what
the
government
promised
to
do.
because
the
government's
promises
as
a
part
of
the
plea
agreement,
again,
are
just
two
paragraphs
of
this
case.
our
suggestion
is
when
the
government
breaches
what
they
promised
to
do,
that's
when
the
automatic
reversal--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--yes.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
well,
certainly,
we
--
we'd
never
suggest--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--well,
your
honor,
it
--
it
seems
harsh
and
perhaps
it
is
harsh,
but
the
government
has
to
abide
by
the
contracts
they
make.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
for
it
to
be
reversible,
yes.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
i'm
sorry.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
we
--
if
the
government
breaches
the
plea
agreement,
yes.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
well,
i
would
suggest--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--i
would
suggest
that
the
word
"void"
may
also
be
"voidable".
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
your
honor,
these
are
not
easy
issues.
certainly,
defense
attorneys
should
not
ever
sit
on
his
hands
and
let
these
things
go.
to
take
a
chance
and
to
just
say,
oh,
we
are
going
to
do
nothing
and
just
sandbag,
like
is
suggested
by
the
government,
i'm
suggesting
that
is
never
going
to
occur.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
it's
absolutely
--
mr.
puckett--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--it
has
been
breached.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
at
the
defendant's
option
to
do
so.
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--because
the
government
--
well,
we
don't
know
that,
what
the
sentence
would
have
been
by
the
sentencing
judge.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
because
the
jurisprudence
teaches
that
the
result
of
the
effect
on
the
sentencing
judge
is
simply
irrelevant.
if
the
government
breach--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--i
believe
so,
yes.
but
there
is
a
reason
for
it.
this
court
has
stated
the
government
cannot
breach
the
plea
agreement.
that's
all
we're
saying.
the
power
the
government
has
in
reducing
the
plea,
the
rights
the
defendants
are
giving
up,
it
should
be
at
the
option
of
the
defendant
to
decide.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
i
--
i'm
not
suggesting
it
would
be
metaphysical.
i'm
simply
suggesting--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--i
think
that
suggests
that
the
result
on
the
judge
has
to
do
with
the
breach,
what
the
government
does.
the
concept
is,
if
the
government
breaches
the
plea
agreement,
the
defendants
should
have
the
right
to
withdraw
from
the
plea
even
if
there
is
no
effect
on
the
sentence.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
because
it
doesn't
occur.
i
mean,
the
government
could
not
cite
a
single
case
in
which
this--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--there
is
an
absolute
--
the
good
reason
is
the
defendant
should
get
the
promises
the
government
has
elicited
for
his
giving
up
of
his
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
99.9
percent
of
the
time
that's
going
to
be
adverse
to
the
defendant,
as
it
was
in
this
case.
a
possibly
hypothetical
situation
where
the
judge
would
forego
or
ignore
what
the
united
states
attorney
says
and
give
him
acceptance
points
is
so
rare,
as
i
suggest,
to
not
really
be--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--harmless
error?
yes,
i
--
if
it
--
well,
harmless
error
if
you
are
talking
about
structural
error,
i
mean
it's
a
little
different
analysis.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
well,
i
think
sometimes
the
defendant
might
well
do
that.
i
mean,
it's
not--
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
--well,
by
certainly
the
appeal
that
we
raised.
certainly
he
stated
on
the
record
some
questions
or
concerns
about
what
overall
had
happened
to
him,
and
certainly
he
pursued
this
appeal.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
lars
r.
isaacson
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
problem
that
the
puckett
panel
had
in
the
third
prong
of
52(b)
they
focused
on
whether
or
not
there
is
prejudice
at
sentencing.
that
was
the
focus
of
the
puckett
panel.
that
is
why
they
said
52(b)
plain
error
applied
and
was
found
in
that
case.
the
problem
with
that
is
that
santobello
clearly
points
out
that
prejudice
to
the
trial
judge,
that
the
trial
judge
--
what
the
trial
judge
would
have
done
is
simply
not
relevant.
that
is
why
52(b)
cannot
be
applied
in
this
case.
secondly,
when
the
government
argues
that
there
is
no
prejudice
--
you
have
to
show
prejudice
at
sentencing,
the
judge
would
have
done
something
different,
that
is
virtually
an
impossible
standard.
under
18
u.s.c.
355
--
there
are
a
number
of
factors
a
sentencing
judge
has
to
take
into.
the
idea
--
and
there
is
many
different
factors
they
must
look
at,
all
of
these
different
things.
the
idea
that
a
defendant
can
somehow
show
a
judge
would
have
come
to
a
different
result
but
for
the
government
breach
is
an
impossibility.
the
final
point
i
would
make
is,
the
argument
the
government
is
making
now
about
prejudice,
it
would
make
no
difference
at
all
if
the
defendant
had
objected
at
the
time.
if
there
is
no
effect
on
sentencing,
it
would
not
pass
muster
under
plain-error
or
the
harmless
error
standards.
so
the
next
case
that
is
going
to
come
before
this
court
is
when
you
have
an
objection,
and
then
they're
going
to
say
the
exact
same
argument
here.
we
would
ask
you
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit.
