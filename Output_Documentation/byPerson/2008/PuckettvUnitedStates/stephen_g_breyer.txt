looking
at
this,
why
can't
we
say
the
following?
some
circuits
have
said
that
they
will
never
recognize
plain
error,
when
it's
a
breach
of
a
plea
agreement.
that's
wrong.
it
could
be
plain
error
like
any
other
kind
of
a
case,
every
other
kind
of
issue.
sure.
but
the
error
here
isn't
plain.
on
the
one
hand,
all
they
did,
the
promise
was
the
government
agreed
to
request
that
his
sentence
be
placed
at
the
lowest
end,
and
they
followed
it.
in
the
other
part
they
made
no
promise.
they
simply
agreed
that
he
had
demonstrated
acceptance
of
responsibility.
and
then
what
they
did
at
the
trial,
they
said,
"we
don't
want
him
to
get
acceptance
of
responsibility
at
this
point.
"
now,
some
people
could
argue
that
here
is
an
implicit
promise
in
paragraph
1,
not
to
say
something
at
the
trial
that
is
contrary
to
their
recognition
in
paragraph
8.
that's
where
it
is.
on
the
other
hand,
you
could
argue
that
there
is
implicit,
also,
a
promise
not
to
implicitly
do
the
first
implicit,
if
what
he
has
done
in
the
meantime
is
commit
another
serious
crime.
so
we
have
two
arguments,
one
of
which
says
they
committed
error,
and
one
of
which
says
they
didn't
commit
error;
and
the
argument
turns
on
two
implicit
readings
of
paragraph
8.
therefore,
it
is
not
plain.
end
of
case.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
the
government
would
like
a
whole
lot
of
questions
answered.
so
what
i
don't
see
is
how
the
government
can
come
here
because
they
want
a
lot
of
questions
answered,
and
get
us
to
take
the
case,
which
i'm
not
sure
was
a
wonderful
idea;
maybe
it
was.
but
then
we
take
the
case,
and
now
they
want
us
to
say,
no,
no,
don't
take
the
obvious
response
to
it
because
we
would
like
you
to
answer
five
other
questions.
so
what
i
want
to
know
is,
what's
wrong
with
what
i
said?
is
that
a
possible
outcome?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
can
only
get
--
they
can
only
get
your
breach
if
they
find
an
implicit
agreement.
the
implicit
agreement
is
that
you
will
not
tell
the
court
that,
in
light
of
changes,
paragraph
8
no
longer
describes
the
situation.
you
didn't
breach
paragraph
8,
as
taken
literally.
you
agree
he
had
shown
that
acceptance
of
responsibility.
what
you
told
the
court
was,
now
we
don't
think
he
should
have
this
acceptance
of
responsibility,
which
previously
he
had
shown,
because
he's
committed
another
crime.
those
are
the
exact
words
you
said
to
the
court.
now,
he
may
have
made
an
implicit
not
to
do
that.
on
the
other
hand,
that
implicit
promise
may
be
negative
by,
you
know,
the
other
implicit
acceptance
of
the
fact
that
this
applies
only
where
we
don't
commit
another
crime.
so
i'm
just
saying
this
--
i'm
not
saying
you
are
even
right.
i'm
just
saying,
having
those
two
arguments,
it
seems
that
you
aren't
plainly
wrong.
you
aren't
plainly
wrong.
so
how
do
i
get
to
the
other
questions
if
i
believe
that?
do
i
say,
"hypothetically
if
the
error
here
were
plain,
which
i
think
it
isn't,
then
i'd
like
to
tell
you
where
the
burden
of
proof
lies?
"
by
the
way,
if
i
happened
to
think
that
that's
whatever
it
is,
then
i
will
go
into
a
few
other
things.
that's
really
what
i
feel
you
are
asking
me
to
do
because
i
don't
think
it's
plain.
maybe
the
other
people
think
it's
plain.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
fulfilled
paragraph
9,
didn't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
say
just
for
me,
because
i
am
changing
a
little
bit
here
in
light
of
that
question,
but
what
is
it
precisely
that
the
government
said
it
would
do
that
it
did
not
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
it
say?
what
are
the
words
that
it
says
the
government
did
not
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
did
agree.
"we
agreed
that
he
does
qualify.
"
and
then
when
you
got
to
the
court,
you
said,
now
we
don't
agree
that
he
qualifies
at
this
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
want
to
--
as
i
point
out
one
other
thing
to
you.
i
think
it's
a
hard
question,
burden
of
proof
and
these
other
things,
that
i
just
turned
the
page,
after
the
person,
ms.
simms,
she's
the
prosecutor,
and
she's
absolutely
clear
to
me,
others
can
disagree,
that
this
judge
knew
just
what
the
government
had
agreed
to,
and
the
prosecutor
was
saying
that
now
things
have
changed.
and
then
the
judge
turns
to
the
probation
officer,
and
the
probation
officer
says,
just
to
reiterate
what
ms.
simms
said,
the
new
offense,
according
to
the
guidelines
of
the
guideline
manual,
prohibits
any
acceptance
of
responsibility.
now,
if
that
turns
out
to
be
right,
of
course,
it
couldn't
matter
less
whose
burden
of
proof
it
is.
