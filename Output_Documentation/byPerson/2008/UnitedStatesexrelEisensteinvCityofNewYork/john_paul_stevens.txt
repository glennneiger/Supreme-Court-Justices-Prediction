justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
about:
are
there
a
number
of
circuits
that
follow
the
60-day
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
those
cases,
suppose
we
decide
your
way
in
this
case.
what
happens
to
the
--
all
the
appeals
that
have
been
taken
relying
on
the
60-day
rule?
because
i
understand
the
failure
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
is
jurisdictional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
of
those
would
be
terminated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
about
judgments
that
have
been
entered
based
on
appeals
that
were--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
we
are
really
--
in
several
circuits,
a
really
rather
important
decision
is
being
called
for?
