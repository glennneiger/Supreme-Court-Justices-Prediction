mr.
gideon
a.
schor
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
two
main
reasons,
the
second
circuit's
judgment
should
be
reversed.
first,
under
appellate
rule
4(a)(1)(b)
the
government
is
a
party
in
qui
tam
actions
because
it
is
named,
served,
and
bound
and
a
real
party
in
interest,
all
without
ever
intervening
or
actively
participating.
and
second,
any
participation-based
test
party
status
will
create
a
burdensome
fact-specific
jurisdictional
inquiry
at
the
start
of
every
appealed
and
declined
qui
tam--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--it
will
be
quite
difficult
and
burdensome,
even
upon
entry
of
judgment,
for
a
relator
or
a
defendant
to
determine
whether
the
government's
participation
was
sufficiently
active
to
make
the
government
a
party
for
purpose--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--well,
under
the
--
under
the
active
participation
test,
that
may
be.
but
the
question
is
--
is,
will
this
court
be
adopting
the
active
participation
test.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
in
--
well,
to
address
your
honor's
first
point,
the
second
circuit's
test
was
participation.
the
test
proposed
by
respondents
and
the
government
is
active
participation,
which
narrows
--
narrows
it
somewhat.
we
point
out
in
our
opening
brief
that
it's
hard
to
conclude
that
the
government
did
nothing
here.
it
did
request
to
receive
orders
and--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--well,
our
position
is
that
the
test
is
the
wrong
test.
our
position
is
that--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--and
i
think
it
will
be
a
very
difficult
determination
for
the
relator
or
the
defendant
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
government
expressly
declines
to
limit
or
define
the
circumstances
constituting
active
participation.
so
there
will
be
a
whole
series
of
legal
determinations
and
possibly
trips
to
this
court
to
determine
the
content
of
the
standard.
secondly,
there
will
be
enormously
difficult
fact-gathering
efforts
for
the
--
that
the
relator
and
the
defendant
will
have
to
undergo
at
the
end
of
a
case
after
judgment
has
been
entered.
sometimes
a
docket
sheet
in
a
fully
litigated
qui
tam
action,
declined
or
not,
can
be
a
hundred
or
200
pages,
and
the
case
will
have
gone
on
for
5
or
5
years.
the
standard
would
require
--
the
active
participation
standard
would
require
the
relator
or
the
defendant
to
comb
through
the
docket
sheet
to
find
every
instance
of
government
participation
to
see
whether,
if
the
docket
sheet
will
review
it,
the
participation
was
sufficiently
active.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
respectfully,
i
think
that
might
read
out
of
the
rules
the
60-day
period.
but
also,
i
think
it's
a
reflex
among
trained
counsel
always
to
see
first,
as
soon
as
judgment
is
entered,
how
much
time
do
i
have
to
file
the
notice
of
appeal.
so
the
inquiry
will
have
to
be
undertaken
unless
the--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--if
that's
the
position,
then
that
will
read
out
of
the
rules
the
60-day
period.
the
rules
do
contain
a
60-day
period.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
if
it
becomes
too
difficult
to
determine
whether
the
government
is
a
party,
then
it
--
then
it
would
be
very
hard
to
imagine
the
relator
or
the
defendant
who
will
feel
able
to
invoke
the
60-day
provision,
and
that
would
effectively
make
it
a
dead
letter--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--it's
--
it's
the
case
that
people
read
the
rules
and
see
there's
a
--
there
are
30
days
if
the
government's
not
a
party
and
60
days
if
the
government
is
a
party.
it's
--
it's
a
function
of
the
rules
themselves.
if
the
rules
say
there's
a
60-day
period--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--if
we're
talking
about
relator's
counsel,
sometimes
in
a
declined
qui
tam
action
the
relator's
counsel
may
wait
to
determine,
may
want
to
know
whether
the
government
will
be
filing
any
sort
of
amicus
brief
on
appeal
before
determining
whether
we'll
go
ahead
with
the
appeal.
and
rather
than
filing
what's
known
as
a
protective
notice
of
appeal,
which
isn't
--
which
isn't
an
optimal
procedure--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--relator's
counsel
is
frequently
in
touch
with
government
counsel.
and
an
important
factor
in
whether
relator's
counsel
will
pursue
an
appeal
and
spend
the
money
on
the
appeal
is
whether
they
will
have
support
in
any
respect
from
the
government.
so
sometimes
it
is
the
case
that
relator's
counsel
will
very
much
want
to
know
if
government
--
if
the
government
will
be
making
any
sort
of
supportive
filing
on
the
appeal,
and
that
may
take
longer
to
determine
than
the
30
days.
sometimes
it's
60
days.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
that
is
true.
i
think
it's
a
suboptimal
procedure
to
file
something,
to
file
a
notice
with
the
court
if
--
if
you're
not
certain
that
it's
going
to
be
pursuing
your
appeal.
i
think
it's
better
to
wait
and
not
file
until
one
is
certain
that
one
will
be
pursuing
the
appeal.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
correct.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
no,
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
government
is
a
party
only
for
some
purposes
and
not
others.
our
arguments
are
consistent
with
the
view
that
the
government
is
a
party
for
the
case.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
correct,
and
respondents'
as
well.
if
the
court,
however,
wants
to
rule
narrowly
and
just
decide
the
rule
4(a)(1)(b)
issue,
whether
the
government
is
a
party
under
rule
4(a)(1)(b),
our
arguments
are
certainly
consistent
with
that
as
well.
the
government
is
--
well
let
me
address
one
issue
that
may
be
in
the
court's
mind
or
that
the
court
may
be
asking.
well,
petitioner,
you
know,
we
have
the
government
telling
us
that
it
doesn't
need
the
60
days
when
it
doesn't
intervene
or
actively
participate;
doesn't
that
end
the
matter.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
well,
the
rule
is
that
if
the
government
gets
60
days
everybody
gets
60
days,
even
private
parties
like
the
relator.
but
i
believe
the
government's
position
is
that
if
the
rationale
for
giving
60
days
doesn't
apply,
then
everyone
else
shouldn't
get
the
benefit
of
the
60
days,
either.
i
believe
that's
the
government's
position.
we
would
argue
that
two
factors
detract
from
the
government's
argument
in
that
respect.
first
of
all,
it's
unrealistic
to
think
that
the
government
will
never
need
the
60-day
period
if
it
doesn't
intervene
or
actively
participate.
the
problem
arises
if
the
relator
does
not
appeal.
if
the
relator
litigates
and
tries
a
case
with
sufficient
skill
that
the
government
doesn't
need
to
take
over
and
the
district
court
nonetheless
enters
judgment
for
the
defendant,
the
problem
arises
if
the
relator
doesn't
appeal
or
doesn't
appeal
the
particular
issue
or
order
that
the
government
would
like
before
the
court
of
appeals.
in
that
case,
an
amicus
filing
won't
protect
the
government's
interests
and
the
government
will
have
to
appeal.
and
once
it's
conceded
that
the
government
has
to
appeal,
then
it
has
to
be
conceded
that
the
government
will
need
60
days.
that
is,
that
the
rationale
for
the
60-day
period
is
fully
applicable.
it's
also
true
sometimes
--
it's
not
at
all
fanciful
that
the
relator
might
not
appeal.
the
relator
might
have
spent
a
lot
of
money,
time
and
money
pursuing
the
trial,
and,
having
lost,
may
have
called
it
quits
for
purposes
of
the
appeal.
or
the
defendant
might
say
to
the
relator:
look,
if
you
don't
pursue
your
appeal,
we
won't
file
a
bill
of
costs
against
you.
there
could
be
all
kinds
of
reasons
why
the
relator
might
not
appeal.
if
the
relator
doesn't
appeal,
there
will
be
no
appeal
in
which
the
government
can
make
an
amicus
filing.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
it
--
it
may
be,
but
i
believe
that
if
rule
4(a)(1)(b)
creates
a
60-day
period,
then
the
litigants
have
an
entitlement
to
invoke
it.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
correct.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--since
the
government
is
bound
by
the
judgment,
i
believe
that
the
government
does
have
that
right.
i
don't
have
authority
in
the
false
claims
act
context
for
that
position,
but
i
think
it
follows
from
the
conclusion,
which
is
undisputed
here,
that
the
government
is
bound
by
the
judgment
in
a
declined
qui
tam
action
even
where
the
government
doesn't
actively--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--yes,
i
think
that's
right,
although
they
can
speak
for
themselves.
now,
the
--
it's
important
also
to
note
that
when
the
government
declines
to
proceed
with
a
qui
tam
action,
it
might
be
declining
to
conduct
the
action
or
take
discovery
or
use
its
resources,
but
it's
not
declining
to
get
a
judgment.
the
judgment
gets
a
binding
judgment
even
when
it
declines.
there's
no
dispute
that
the
claim
is
the
government's
claim
and
that
the
judgment
finally
disposes
of
it.
if
in
a
declined
action
the
relator
litigates
and
gets
a
$10
million
award,
the
government
takes
the
money.
and
so
the
government
is
bound
by
the
judgment.
the
judgment,
finally
disposes
of
the
government's
claim.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
the
government
has
to
make
requests.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
the--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--no.
but
congress
can
restrict
the
operation
of
particular
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
argument
that
i
think
your
honor
is
averting
to
is
the
rule
5
argument
that
my
--
that
respondents
and
the
government
make.
rule
5
doesn't
define
who
the
party
is.
it
attaches
certain
consequences
to
being
a
party,
but
it
doesn't
define
who
a
party
is.
it
says
you
get
to
be
served
if
you
are
a
party.
you
get
to
be
served
with
certain
pleadings
and
congress--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--congress
restricted
that
right
in
the
false
claims
act.
but
that
doesn't
make
it
a
party.
what
makes
it
a
party
is
whether
it's
named--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--the
fact
that
ordinarily
a
party
might
get
served
with
certain
pleadings
doesn't
mean
that
if
congress
restricts
that
right,
it's
not
a
party.
it
means
it's
a
party
that
congress
has
--
for
whom
congress
has
restricted
the
right.
and
that--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--no,
we
are
not
arguing
that.
to
be
a
party,
a
real
party
in
interest
must
be
named
in
the
--
the
actions
needs
to
be
brought
in
the
name
of
the
real
party
in
interest.
and
we've
cited
abundant
authority
for
the
proposition
that
that
means
that
the
pleadings
must
identify
that
person
by
name.
if
the
action
is
to
be
brought
in
the
name
of
smith,
then
the
pleadings
must
identify
smith
as
the
plaintiff.
so
the
naming
requirement
must
be
complied
with.
it's
not
sufficient
in
our
view
just
to
be
a
real
party.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
it
does
read
that
way.
i
think
the
addition
of
"only"
is
logician's
language,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
drafters--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--it
may
be,
but
not
every
drafting
of
a
statute
rises
to
that
level
of--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--of
quality.
the
attachment
of
the
condition
5.
and
--
and
there
are
a
number
of
instances
where
congress
will
restrict
the
operation
of
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
even
when
someone
is
concededly
a
party
to
the
case.
i
have
cited
a
number
of
instances
in
that
--
of
that
in
our
reply
brief.
there
are
a
number
of
statutory
actions,
especially
where
the
government
is
a
party,
where,
even
though
it
is
concededly
a
party
and
everyone's
a
party,
the
--
the
normal
party
discovery
obligations
don't
apply.
we
have
cited
foia
and
epa
and
tax
summons
and
--
and
habeas
is
a
slightly
different
example.
but
there
are
many
examples
where
congress
will
step
in
and
restrict
the
obligations
that
the
federal
rules
would
otherwise
apply
to
people
who
are
parties
without
depriving
them
of
party
status.
i
would
like
to
address
the
intervention
provision.
we
have
many
arguments
in
our
briefs
as
to
why
the
intervention
provision
doesn't
determine
party
status.
i
think
that
the
simplest
way
from
a
to
b
is
to
follow
through
to
its
conclusion
an
example
that
the
government
gives.
the
government
says
that
if
it
vetoes
a
settlement,
then
it
is
a
party.
well,
if
it
vetoes
a
settlement
--
that
is,
without
having
intervened.
if
it
vetoes
a
settlement
without
having
intervened,
the
case
goes
forward
because
there
is
no
settlement.
but
then
if
the
government
wants
to
conduct
the
action,
the
only
way
it
can
conduct
the
action
under
the
statute
is
if
it
then
intervenes.
so
you
have
a
case
where
the
government
is
already
a
party
when
it
intervenes;
and,
therefore,
even
under
the
government's
example
the
intervention
provision
cannot
determine
party
status.
i
would
like
to
just
go
back
to
the
definition
of
--
of
"party"
that
is
in
our
briefing.
the
--
several
provisions
of
the
false
claims
act
show
that,
even
without
ever
intervening
or
actively
participating,
the
government
satisfies
the
classic
elements
of
party
status.
it's
a
real
party
interest
because
the
statute
upholds
the
government's
claim
and
gives
the
government
the
bulk
of
recovery.
the
--
the
government
is
named
as
a
plaintiff
in
the
pleadings
pursuant
to
the
act's
naming
requirements.
the
government
is
served
with
the
complaint
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
4
pursuant
to
the
act's
service
requirement.
and
the
government
is
bound
by
the
judgment,
which
is
not
even
disputed
here.
those
are
the
classic
elements
of
party
status,
and
the
government
satisfies
them
all
in
this
case.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
accurate
to
say
that
the
government
is
an
involuntary
plaintiff,
because
congress
has
said
the
united
states
will
be
a
plaintiff
under
these
circumstances
and
--
and
in
that
respect
congress
has
spoken
for
the
united
states.
it
is
an
oddity
of
the
false
claims
act
that
the
plaintiff
is
served
with
the
complaint,
but
that's
there
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
and
once
it's
served,
having
been
named
and
having
been
already
a
real
party
in
interest
by
operation
of
law,
then
it
has
--
it's
already
a
party
at
that
point.
and
if
it's
a
party
at
that
point,
then
it's
a
party
for
purposes
of
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
4(a)(1)(b)
and
--
and
may
be
for
other
purposes
as
well.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
yes.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--in
--
in
our
argument
it
is
a
party
even
though
it
is
not
subject
to
discovery.
there
are
two
ways
one
could
characterize
the
government.
one
can
either
say
it's
not
a
party
for
purposes
of
discovery;
or,
as
we
say,
citing
authority
in
our
reply,
it
is
a
party,
but
it
is
for
other
statutory
reasons
not
subject
to
discovery.
the
declination
provision
is
key
here.
by
the
declination
provision
congress
said
the
government
can
decline
to
engage
in
discovery.
all
right.
it
declines
to
conduct
the
action.
one
aspect
of
conducting
the
action
is
engaging
in
discovery.
the
government
can
decline
to
engage.
that
means
not
only
not
serving
discovery
requests,
but
not
responding
to
discovery
requests.
and
that's
part
and
parcel
of
the
declination
provision.
that's
the
way
congress
structured
it.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
the
declination
provision,
your
honor?
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
no,
that's
all
right.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
oh.
well,
it's
certainly
on
page
2
of
our
opening
brief.
it
says:
"if
the
government
elects
not
to
proceed
with
the
action,
the
person
who
initiated
the
action
shall
have
the
right
to
conduct
the
action.
"
and
there
are
other
provisions
that
we
cite
in
footnote
27.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
well,
footnote
27
of
our
brief
also
cites
other
provisions
of
the
act
that
--
that
define
what
it
means
"to
conduct
the
action".
and
discovery
is
one
of
them,
and
the
declination
provision
says
that
if
the
government
declines
--
if
the
government
--
if
the
government
intervenes,
then
it
conducts
the
action;
if
it
declines,
then
it
doesn't
conduct
the
action.
and
the
rest
of
the
act
defines
what
"conducting
the
action"
is,
and
that
includes
discovery.
so
our
--
our
conclusion
from
that
is
that
when
the
government
declines
to
conduct
the
action,
it's
going
to
decline
to
engage
in
discovery.
that's
--
that's
the
argument.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
yes,
that's
our
position,
and
i
think
that's
the
government's
position
as
well.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
it
would
be--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--if
--
it's
a
party
who
is
because
of
the
declination
provision
not
subject
to
discovery.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
because
the
declination
provision
says
that
if
the
government
declines,
then
it
will
not
conduct
the
action;
the
relator
will
conduct
the
action.
and
"conducting
the
action"
is
defined
elsewhere
in
the
statute
as
including
conducting
discovery,
engaging
in
discovery.
and
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
congress
contemplating
such
asymmetry
in
--
in
discovery
obligations
that--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--there
is
--
it's
an
inference
drawn
from
the
statute,
your
honor.
in
sum,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
thank
you.
i
think
it
begs
the
question
to
say
that
by
its
declination
the
government
is
declining
party
status.
it
is
declining
to
conduct
the
action.
that's
a
much
more
limited
category
than
the
category
of
party
status.
the
government
is
a
party
because
it
is
named,
served,
and
bound,
and
a
real
party
in
interest.
and
i
didn't
hear
any
arguments
addressing
why
the
intervention
provision
is
not
determinative
of
--
of
party
status
in
response
to--
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
--we
--
we
--
our
position
is
that
it
--
that
it
is
a
party.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
well,
again,
we
think
it's
a
party
although
for
other
reasons
in
the
statute
that
it's
not
subject
to
full
party
discovery
because
of
the
declination
provision,
which
i
discussed
in
--
in
the
opening.
i
would
also
take
issue
with
the
assertion
of
respondent's
counsel
that
it's
--
that
it's
their
rule
that
will
be
the
bright-line
test.
clearly,
it's
petitioner's
rule.
petitioner
says
that
the
government
is
a
party
in
all
qui
tam
actions
for
purposes
of
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
4(a)(1)(b).
that
forecloses
all
of
the
jurisdictional
inquiries.
it
forecloses
the
--
the
pending
case
issue.
it
forecloses
the
--
the
complicated
question
of
when
--
if
the
government
gets
a
surprisingly
bad
--
if
a
district
court
issues
a
surprisingly
adverse
judgment
when
the
government
doesn't
intervene,
the
government
--
the
government
wants
to
intervene
for
purposes
of
appeal.
certainly,
first
of
all,
the
government
--
that
--
that
question
of
whether
to
intervene
is
essentially
the
question
of
whether
to
appeal,
and
so
it
should
have
60
days,
given
the
rationale
for
the
rule.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
think
--
i
think
the
--
an
active
participation
standard
would
create
far
more
trouble,
far
more
complexity.
it
would
be
almost
impossible
for
relators
and
defense
to
--
to
know
in
advance
what's
--
what's
required
of
them.
mr.
gideon
a.
schor
well,
i
think
their
concern
is
that
--
is
discovery
primarily,
and
we
have
certainly
put
plenty
of
arguments
in
our
brief
as
to
why
that
concern
is
--
is
less
and
there
is
certainly
plenty
of
authority
for
--
for
thinking
that
the
government
won't
be
subject
to
discovery.
