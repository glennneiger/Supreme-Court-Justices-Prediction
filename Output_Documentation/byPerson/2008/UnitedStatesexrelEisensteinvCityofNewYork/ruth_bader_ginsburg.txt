why
at
the
start?
why
isn't
the
time
the
end,
when
we
can
--
the
notice
of
appeal
is
to
be
filed
after
there
is
a
judgment.
why
isn't
the
proper
time
to
determine
number
of
days
to
appeal
when
the
judgment
is
entered?
and
at
that
point,
one
can
see
that
the
government
has
done
nothing,
absolutely
nothing
in
the
case.
at
the
inception,
i
agree
with
you,
we
don't
know
what,
if
anything,
the
government
is
going
to
do.
but
by
the
time
judgment
is
entered,
we
surely
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
hear
the
government
did
nothing,
not
one
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
test
is
--
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
"active
participation"
as
opposed
to
just
plain
participation.
if
the
rule
is
at
the
time
judgment
is
entered
to
determine
how
much
time
you
have
to
file
your
notice
of
appeal,
the
question
is,
has
the
government
done
anything?
and
if
the
government
has
done
nothing
at
all,
then
you
have
30
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
advantage?
i
mean,
a
notice
of
appeal
is
the
easiest
document,
so
it's
not
a
question
that
there's
any
labor
involved
in
doing
this.
but
is
there
any
advantage
to
filing
--
to
taking
the
60
days
instead
of
the
30
days?
why
would
counsel
want
to
take
advantage
of
the
extra
30
days?
it
isn't
a
question
of
a
labor,
having
to
write,
like
having
to
write
a
brief.
what
advantage
would
there
be
to
taking
the
additional
30
days?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
the
--
how
would
you
know
at
the
time
of
filing
of
the
notice
of
appeal
whether
the
government
is
thereafter
going
to
file
an
amicus
brief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government
is
not
saying
it
doesn't
need
the
60
days.
it's
saying
you
don't
qualify
for
the
60
days,
you
are
not
the
government.
i
don't
think
the
government
is
arguing
that
its
own
time
can
be
shortened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
the
government
appeal
without
having
intervened
in
the
district
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think
that
everyone
--
you
are
relying
on
the
government,
that
the
government
is
in
the
caption
and
it's
a
real
party
in
interest.
is
every
real
party
in
interest
a
party
for
this
purpose?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
something
odd
about
--
plaintiffs
come
to
the
court
seeking
something.
defendants
are
--
are
stuck.
they're
being
sued.
and
here
the
united
states
is
an
involuntary
plaintiff.
it
didn't
commence
this
lawsuit,
and
i
think
there
must
be
many
cases
where
the
government
will
say,
we
don't
want
anything
to
do
with
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
the
judgment
have
to
be
vacated?
even
a
jurisdictional
issue
becomes
subject
to
preclusion
once
you
have
gone
the
appeal
route--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
even
the
jurisdictional
base
can
be
precluded
and
not
raised
on
collateral
attack.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
are
certain
things
the
government
can
do,
you
concede,
without
intervening?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
government
did
decide
to
take
over,
the
qui
tam
plaintiff
would
remain
a
party--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
why
shouldn't
it
work
the
other
way?
when
the
government
stays
out,
it's
a
party
--
when
the
government
isn't
conducting
the
litigation,
it's
a
party
just
as
a
qui
tam
plaintiff
would
be
a
party.
