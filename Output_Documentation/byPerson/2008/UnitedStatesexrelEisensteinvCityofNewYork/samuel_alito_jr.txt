it's
not
really
a
party
for
all
purposes
in
your
submission.
it's
not
a
party
for
discovery
purposes,
is
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
the
relators
and
the
parties
in
the
four
circuits
that
have
adopted
the
60-day
rule.
they
had
a
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
front
of
them
that
said
you
had
60
days.
they're
just
out
of
luck
now?
