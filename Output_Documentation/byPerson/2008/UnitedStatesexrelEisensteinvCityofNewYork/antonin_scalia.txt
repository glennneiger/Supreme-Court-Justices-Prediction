justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
the
question,
whether
that's
enough
or
whether
the
government's
power
to
prevent
discovery,
which
it
can
do,
is
that
alone
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
but
--
but
i'm
saying
there
are
various
steps
the
governments
--
the
government
can
take,
and
i
--
i
think
you
have
a
point,
that
even
though
this
case
may
be
an
easy
one,
we're
going
to
have
to
decide
in
future
cases
how
much
--
how
much
activity
by
the
government
is
enough
activity
to
make
the
government
a
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
it
turns
out
the
government
is
not
going
to
come
in,
you
can
always
dismiss
the
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
anyway,
a
rule's
a
rule
and
discussing
all
of
these
consequences
is
beside
the
point.
if,
indeed,
the
government's
a
party,
it's
60
days,
right,
and
you
say
the
government's
a
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
government
is
a
party
to
this
case
for
all
purposes,
for
all
purposes
of
all
the
rules,
or
is
it
just
some
of
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
opposed
to
the
government's
view,
which
does
sort
of
pick
and
choose
between--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
your
argument
goes
--
is
replying
to
the
government
the
respondent's
argument
that
there
is
no
sense
in
giving
60
days
to
the
government,
and
what
you're
saying
is,
yes,
sometimes
there
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
when
the
government
has
not
actively
participated.
so
it
really
negates,
you
know,
you're
doing
something
that
has
no
point.
it
could
have
a
point,
to
give
the
government
60
days,
even
in
a
case
where
it
has
not
actively
participated.
it
may
need
that
long
to
consult
with
other
agencies
as
to
whether
to
accept
a
defeat
in
this
case
or
--
or
on
its
own
to
conduct
an
appeal
if
the
relator
doesn't
want
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
the
government
will
agree
with
that.
i'm
sure
that's
one
of
the
contexts
in
which
they
agree
that
the
government
is
a
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
are
some
provisions
that
--
that
seem
to
indicate
the
government
isn't
a
party.
for
example,
it
specifically
provides
that
even
when
the
government
hasn't
intervened,
the
government
may
request
copies
of
the
pleadings.
doesn't
it
have
to
make
requests
for
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
would
it
have
to
do
that
if
it's
a
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
--
i
mean,
you're
saying
they
are
not
a
party
for
that
rule
at
least,
that
requires
the
pleadings
to
be
served
upon
the
other
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
following
you.
i'm
saying
if
--
if
the
government
is
a
party,
rule
5
would
apply
and
the
government
would
automatically
get
copies
of
the
pleading
whether
or
not
it
requested
them.
so
the
provision
in
the
false
claims
act
that
the
government
will
only
get
copies
if
it
requests
them
seems
to
indicate
that
the
government
is
not
a
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
come
back
to
the
rule
5
point
just
for
a
minute?
you
say
that
the
effect
of
the
false
claims
act
is
simply
to
restrict
what
would
normally
be
the
right
of
the
government
to
get
copies
of
all
the
pleadings.
that's
really
not
how
it
reads.
it
doesn't
say
that
the
government
shall
receive
copies
of
the
pleadings
only
if
it
requests
them.
it
says
the
government
shall
receive
copies
of
the
pleadings
if
it
requests
them,
as
though
without
that
provision
it
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
receive
copies.
isn't
that
the
way
it
reads?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
what
we
are
down
here,
you
know.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
precision.
justice
antonin
scalia
may
be
for
other
purposes?
i
thought
you
told
me
before
that
it
was
for
other
purposes
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
let's
stay
on
track.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that?
what
provision
is
that?
i
didn't
focus
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i
am
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
eat
up
your
time
with
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
where
is
it
in
the
stuff
that
i
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
doesn't
say
anything
about
discovery
in
particular.
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
some
declination
provision
that
--
that
said
the
government
is
--
is
not
subject
to
discovery.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
the
fact
that
it
cannot
conduct
discovery
also
involves
the
fact
that
it's
immune
from
discovery,
how
do
you
get
that?
and
it
is;
is
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i'm
sure
it's
the
government's
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
how
can
that
--
how
can
that
be
if
it's
a
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
declination
provision
doesn't
say
that.
the
declination
provision
just
says
that
it
is
not
actively
conducting
the
case.
but
how
do
you
get
its
exemption
from
discovery?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
that,
but
--
but
it's
--
it's
for
me
a
problem
with
your
assertion
that
for
all
purposes
the
government
is
a
party.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
not
a
party
for
purposes
of
discovery,
and
there
is
no
provision
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
false
claims
act
that
exempts
it
from
discovery.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
the
government
here
has
considerable
powers
even
without
intervening,
and
they
include
its
ability
to
move
to
stay
discovery,
which
normally
a
party
would
only
be
able
to
do.
it
can
object
to
any
voluntary
dismissal
or
settlement,
which
normally
would
be
a
party's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
some
courts
have
allowed
the
government
to
move
to
dismiss.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
unlike
--
unlike
your
adversary
here,
you
--
your
adversary
says
the
government
is
a
party
for
all
purposes;
you
are
not
saying
the
government
is
not
a
party
for
all
purposes.
you're
saying
it's
not
a
party
for
some
purposes?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
saying
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
also
saying
as
for
the
rest,
sometimes
it
is,
sometimes
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
rely
a
lot,
counsel,
on
--
on
intervention,
as
that's
what
makes
the
government
a
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
original
statute
or
the
earlier
statute
did
not
use
the
word
"intervention".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
forget
the
different
word
it
used?
justice
antonin
scalia
appearance?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
really
wonder
whether
they
didn't
intend
the
same
--
the
same
result.
if
you
think
they
consciously
--
under
the
prior
statute,
you
would
say
the
government--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
government
would
have
been
a
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you
can
be
a
party
and
not
appear.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
side
acknowledges
that.
they
say,
however,
it's
different
when
you
have
real
party
in
interest
plus
the
party
named--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
these
things
are
styled
"united
states".
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no.
no,
no,
that's
--
that's
unfair.
if
you
are
a
real
party
in
interest
and
you
are
the
named
party--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
normally
a
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
the
united
states
has
a
lot
of
power.
unlike
the
--
the
government's
presentation
here,
you
would
not
allow
any
degree
of
activity
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
cause
it
to
be
a
party,
even
if
it
exercises
all
these
other
powers
short
of
intervening?
it
must
intervene
in
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
do
you
want
a
bright
line
or
not
a
bright
line?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
agree
with
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
agree
with
the
government's
presentation
that
it
becomes
a
party
when
it
reaches
a
certain
ineffable
degree
of
activity
in
the
case?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
they
were
relying
on
devlin.
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
point
they
are
making
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
not
that
we're
a
party
for
some
purposes
and
not
for
others.
the
point
they're
making
is
we're
a
party
for
all
purposes,
once
we
reach
a
certain
degree
of
activity
in
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
they
were.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
disagree
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
we'll
hear
from
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
a
question
for
you,
mr.
wall.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
government's
position
on
that
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
it
need
the
60
days
to
figure
out
whether
it
would
want
to
intervene
in
order
to
be
able
to
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
are
not
statutes
which
give
the
government
an
extended
period
of
time
in
order
to
allow
the
consultation.
this
is
a
statute
that
does
that.
and
why
would
they
--
why
would
they
not
envision
the
need
for
that
consultation
in
the
situation
where
the
government
has
had
no
participation
but
comes
up
with
a
--
with
a
decision
contrary
to
what
it
thinks
the
good
law
is,
and
it
has
to
decide
whether
it
wants
to
intervene
in
order
to
appeal.
why
shouldn't
they
be
given
60
days?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
is
--
it
is
a
potential
appellant.
i
mean
if
you
say
congress
is
concerned
about
situations
in
which
the
government
is
a
potential
appellant.
it
is
a
potential
appellant
in
these
cases
until
the
30
days
have
elapsed,
at
least.
it
--
it
can
intervene,
and
why
shouldn't
it
have
the
60
days
to
decide
whether
to
appeal
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
this
--
this
goes
to
your
argument
about
congressional
intent:
that
they
were
concerned
about
preserving
to
the
government
time
as
a
potential
appellant
to
think
the
matter
over.
it
seems
to
me
that
argument
is
--
is
a
wash.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
the
united
states
intervene
within
those
30
days--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
then
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
a
potential
appellant.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
--
that's
true,
but
that's
not
the
point
that
justice
souter
was
making.
this
is
a
self-denying
position
on
the
part
of
the
government.
you
would
expect
the
government
to
come
in
and
say,
yeah,
give
us
60
days
to
think
this
over.
they're
saying,
no,
we'll
only
take
30,
because
they're
worried
if
we
come
out
your
way
on
that
issue,
there
are
other
issues
on
which
they're
also
going
to
be
considered
a
party,
and
it's
not
worth
the
risk.
