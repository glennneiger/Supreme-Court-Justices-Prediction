justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
petitioner
brought
this
lawsuit
against
the
city
of
new
york
under
the
false
claims
act,
the
fca
which
creates
liability
for
those
who
defraud
the
united
states
government.
the
fca
is
qui
tam
statute
which
means
that
private
parties
may
initiate
such
suit
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
recover
a
share
of
any
damages
that
are
awarded.
the
fca
permits
the
united
states
to
intervene
in
an
action
initiated
by
a
private
party,
but,
the
united
states
declined
to
do
so
in
this
case.
the
district
court
dismissed
petitioner's
claim
as
meritless.
he
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
54
days
later.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
petitioner's
appeal
was
untimely
under
the
federal
rule
to
appellate
procedure
which
normally
give
a
party
only
30
days
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
petitioner
argued
that
his
appeal
was
timely
under
an
exception
that
provides
60
days
to
appeal
in
cases
in
which
the
united
states
is
a
party
to
the
action.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
holding
that
the
united
states
was
not
a
party
to
the
fca
action
because
it
had
not
intervened
or
otherwise
substantially
participated
in
the
action.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
although
the
united
states
is
aware
of
and
minimally
involved
in
every
fca
action,
it
is
not
a
party
to
an
fca
action
for
purposes
of
the
appellate
filing
deadline
unless
it
has
exercised
its
right
to
intervene
in
the
case.
intervention
is
a
usual
method
by
which
one
becomes
a
party
to
a
lawsuit.
and
congress'
decision
to
provide
a
method
for
the
united
states
to
intervene
in
privately
initiated
fca
suits
reflects
its
intention
that
intervention
is
to
be
a
prerequisite
to
obtaining
party
status.
although
the
statute
grants
the
united
states
certain
other
rights
even
when
it
does
not
intervene,
those
rights
are
not
sufficient
to
convert
the
united
states
into
a
party
for
purposes
of
appeal
in
every
fca
case.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
