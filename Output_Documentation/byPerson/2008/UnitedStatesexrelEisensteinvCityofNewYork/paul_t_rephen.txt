mr.
paul
t.
rephen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court:
when
the
government
declines
to
intervene
in
a
qui
tam
action,
it
should
not
be
deemed
a
party
for
purposes
of
the
rules
of
procedure
rule
4.
the
government's
role
is
described
in
terms
of
intervention
as
of
right
in
the
first
60
days
following
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
for
good
cause
thereafter
if
the
government
decides
to
come
in
after
initial
declination.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
i
don't
think
this
is
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
it
is
clear--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--it
is
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states.
but,
you
know,
looking
at
the
statute,
where
the
government
has
declined,
it's
not
a
party.
any
conservative
counsel,
if
there
are
two
periods
of
time,
30
days
or
60
days,
the
intelligent
thing
to
do
is
to
go
ahead--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--and
rejected.
and
i
think
after
--
it
is
hard
to
see--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--i
don't
know
that
it
didn't
occur
to
us.
i
think
we
were
trying
to
reject
it,
and
certainly
after
this
court
decides
the
issue
it
would
no
longer
be
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
the
decision
will
be
out
there,
either
30
days
or
60
days.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
i
think
those
appeals
will
be
terminated.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
i
don't
know.
i
guess
those
judgments
would
have
to
be
vacated,
the
judgments--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--yes,
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
that
is
true,
your
honor,
correct,
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
again,
as
i
said,
the
--
what
the
congress
has
done
--
it
is
very
important
in
this
case
to
look
at
the
legislative
history.
congress
has
given
the
government
60
days
to
weigh
the
risks
and
benefits
of
getting
involved
in
the
case.
if
it
chooses
to
do
so,
it
has
full
responsibility
for
the
conduct
of
the
litigation.
if
it
declines
to
do
that,
the
statute
provides
that
the
relator
shall
have
full
responsibility
for
the
conduct
of
the
litigation
and
requires
the
government,
if
it
subsequently
wants
to
get
involved,
to
make
a
motion
for
intervention,
during
which
time
it
has
to
show
good
cause.
and
it's
our
position
that
intervention
should
be
given
its
ordinary
and
common
meaning,
which
is
the
method
by
which
a
person
who
is
not
a
party
becomes
a
party.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
there
are
certain--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--there
is
certainly
a
limited
role
here,
but
it
is
a
very
limited
role.
the
government
can
do
that.
this
court
has
recognized
that
it
can
be
a
party
for
this
limited
purpose.
for
example,
if
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
and
they
have
--
there
has
to
be
a
hearing
following
that,
and
that
motion
were
denied,
the
government
could
not
then
participate
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
it
would
have
to
move
to
intervene
for
good
cause
if
the
60
days
had
passed.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
what
we're
saying
is
certainly
it
is
not
a
party
in
this
case,
where
it
has
quite
absolutely
no
role.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
there
may
be--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--there
may
--
there
may
be
circumstances.
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
intervention
is
required
even
in
those
limited
circumstances,
that
would
be
okay
with
us.
we're
not
taking--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--we're
not
taking
a
formal
position
on
that.
i
think--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--it
would
have
to
move
to
intervene.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
i
think
we
would
take
the
position
there
is
no
longer
a
case,
your
honor.
it
has
30
days;
the
relator
has
not
appealed.
the
government
was
not
a
party
during
that
30-day
period.
31,
32,
33
days,
the
case
is
over.
i
guess
there
is
a
possibility
for
the
government
to
move
to
extend
its
time
under
the
rules,
but
generally
there
would
be
an
opportunity
for
the
government
to
intervene.
as
soon
as
the
case
is
over,
it
had
not
been
a
party,
it
had
not
chosen
to
be
a
party,
and
the
time
has
expired.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
it
doesn't
apply
if
there
is
no
longer
a
case,
and
if
30
days
has
gone
by,
there
would
be
no
longer
a
case.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
yes.
having
not
intervened
in
the
case,
they
had
not
been
a
party.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
rule
4--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--well,
the
government
--
the
government
is
given
that
opportunity
to
monitor
the
case.
they
can
come
in.
the
government
having
chose--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--that's
right.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
the
rules
give
60
days
to
the
government
when
it's
a
party.
if
it's
not
a
party--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--i
think
the
rules--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--well,
we
rely
on
it
because
that
was
what
congress
said.
congress
has
made
it
clear
using
intervention--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--but
we
used
it
in
a
number--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--"appearance",
maybe.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
is
appearance.
but
congress
--
congress
clearly
means
that
now
in
1986.
i
think
congress
knew
what
it
was
intending.
absent
any
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
not
give
the
term
"intervention"
its
commonly
understood
term
--
and
it's
such
a
commonly
understood
term
--
by
which
a
nonparty
becomes
a
party,
i
think
one
should
give
it
that
normal
intention.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
our
argument
was--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--i
wouldn't--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--i
wouldn't
say
that,
your
honor.
but
i
know
in
1986
what
they
were
attempting
to
do
is
strengthen
the
right
of
private
persons
to
bring
qui
tam
actions.
for
the
first
time,
the
government
was
given
a
limited
right
to
come
in
for
good
cause
after
60
days.
but
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
that,
i
think
congress
intended
that
the
right
of
the
government
to
intervene
after
60
days
was
somewhat
limited,
and
they
had
to
show
good
cause.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
the
big
--
i
think--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--i
think
the
big
deal
is
that
it
can
open
more
questions
that
it
resolves
if
you
give
the
government
party
status
for
this
purpose.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
and
i
think
your
honor,
i
think
that,
chief
justice--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--i
think
the
purpose
of
rule
4
was
to
give
the
government
time
to
make
a
decision
when
it's
actually
a
party
and
it
has
a
right
to
appeal.
it
should
--
it
is
jurisdictional.
it
should
be
construed
narrowly.
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
expedite
the
process
of
appeals--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--well,
if
--
if
the
rule
provides
that
the
government
should
have
60
days
when
it
is
a
party
and
it's
not
a
party,
then
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
bit
more--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--but
i
think
it
wouldn't
be
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress
or
the
intent
of
the
rule,
which
is
to
move
appeals
along
really
within
30
days.
the
exception
is
given
to
the
government
when
it
is
a
party,
when
it
has
to--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--then
i
would
tell
your
honor,
you
know,
whether
or
not
you
want
to
give
somebody
a
break
on
that,
it
is
simply
inconsistent
with
the
rule,
which
requires
the
united
states
to
be
a
party
when
they
have,
as
in
this
case,
played
absolutely
no
role;
and
they
are
clearly
not
a
party.
again,
turning
to
the
question
of
the
real
party
in
interest,
as
i
think
was
discussed,
real
party
in
interest
is
simply
one
who
can
bring
the
lawsuit.
mr.
eisenstein
is
a
real
party
in
interest.
a
real
party
in
interest
is
not
synonymous
with
party
status.
rule
17
describes
real
party
in
interest.
obviously
rule
4
describes
a
party--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--i--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
an
accumulation
of
all
of
these
bits
of
real
party
in
interest.
well,
it
doesn't
really
count,
now
the
parties
named--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--i
think
the
naming
--
the
naming--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--the
naming
is
nominal.
i
think
the
real
question
is
to
look
at
the
intent
of
congress
in
terms
of
the
right
of
the
government
to
participate,
and
i
would
point
out,
i
think
during
the
first
80
years
of
experience
under
the
qui
tam
action,
the
united
states
was
named
but
had
absolutely
no
right
to
play
a
role
in
the
litigation.
i
don't
know
that
we
should
elevate
form
over
substance
here,
and
i
must
come
back
again
to
what
we
think
is
the
critical
role,
which
was
the
intent
of
congress
in
requiring
intervention
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
government
if
it
decides
that
it
wants
to
assume
the
burdens
of
party
status.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
yes,
there
are
certain
limited
roles.
i
don't
know
that
that
makes
them
a
party
for
purposes
of
the
eisenstein
case.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
but
the
government
would
have
primary
responsibility
under
the
statute.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
yes,
i
think
the
standard
is
intervention,
and
absent
intervention
by
the
united
states,
it
should
not
be
a
party.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
no,
we
would
accept
--
if
it
has
to
be
a
bright
line,
we
would
accept
intervention.
we
recognize,
though,
the
standard
that
you
can
be
a
party
for
limited
purpose
as--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--i
would
--
we
would--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--we
would
live
with
a
bright
line
certainly.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
i
don't
know
if
it's
ineffable.
i
think
the
government
was
relying
on
the
devlin
decision,
where
there
was
some
indication
that
there
could
be
status
of
being
a
party
where
there
is
limited
for
participation
for
collateral
purposes.
but
again
in
devlin,
the
government
had
argued
that
intervention
was
the
preferable
method
of
getting
into
a
case.
the
court
rejected
that
because
they
thought
intervention
essentially
would
be
pro
forma,
but
in
this
--
in
this--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--they
were
relying--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--they
were
addressing--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--i
don't
think
the
government
is
saying
they're
a
party
for
all
purposes
which
is
a--
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
--of
activity.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
i
guess
we'll
hear
from
them
shortly.
mr.
paul
t.
rephen
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
then
we
can
--
we
can
hear
from
the
government.
