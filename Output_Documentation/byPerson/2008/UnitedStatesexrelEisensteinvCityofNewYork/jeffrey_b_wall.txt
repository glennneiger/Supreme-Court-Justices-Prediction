mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
thought
you
might.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
actually
wanted
to
start
exactly
where
you
and
justice
ginsburg
began
because
i
think
we've
gotten
off
a
little
bit
on
the
wrong
track.
if
this
court
wants
a
bright-line
rule,
the
right
rule
is
intervention.
now,
that
would
solve
98
or
99
percent
of
qui
tam
suits
under
the
false
claims
act.
the
government
urged
intervention
as
a
prerequisite
in
devlin,
and
this
court
disagreed.
so
the
government
left
open
the
possibility
in
its
brief
that
in
a
very
small
number
of
qui
tam
suits,
on
the
order
of
1
percent
or
less,
it
might
participate,
absent
intervention,
in
a
way
that
would
justify
treatment
as
a
party
under
devlin.
but
whether
or
not
the
court
agrees
with
us
on
that
--
a
question
not
presented
here
where
the
government
hasn't
participated
in
any
way
--
the
right
rule
is
intervention,
and
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
this
court
wants
to
make
it
cover
98
percent
of
the
suits
or
100
percent
of
the
suits.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
no,
we
do
not
think--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--that
the
government
could
have
appealed
the
judgment
here
as
of
right,
and
that
is
why
we
think
the
purposes
of
the
60-day
period
were
not
implicated.
because
the
government
couldn't
appeal,
it
was
not
a
potential
appellant
that
required
the
authorization
of
the
solicitor
general,
and
it
didn't
need
the
60
days.
and
that's
an
important
point,
i
think,
about
why
it
couldn't
just
be
solved
by
the--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia,
i
think
that
would
be
equally
true
in
a
number
of
contexts
--
for
instance,
class
action
settlements
where
the
government
is
entitled
to
notice,
presumably
so
that
it
can
intervene;
government
contractor
suits.
there
are
any
number
of
federal
cases
where
the
government
might
find
the
decision
shocking
and
want
to
come
in,
but
until
it
does,
it's
a
non-party.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
justice
scalia,
with
all
respect,
the
false
claims
act
itself
doesn't
say
anything
about
intervention.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
60
days.
it
just
says
the
government
has
a
right
to
come
in
and
take
over
the
action
and
run
it
and
allow
the
relator
to
continue
as
a
party.
and
that's
why
it
uses
the
word
"intervene"
--
because
congress
understood
that,
in
its
accepted
legal
meaning,
as
a
process
by
which
a
nonparty
becomes
a
party,
and
the
idea
was
to
give
the
executive
branch
a
choice.
in
each
qui
tam
suit,
the
executive
is
able
to
determine
whether
to
assume
the
greater
benefits
and
burdens
of
party
status.
petitioner
is
caught
in
the
awkward
position
of
saying
that
he
thinks
that
the
government
is
a
party
at
the
time
the
case
is
filed,
not
then
a
party
for
purposes
of
discovery,
but
even
though
it
hasn't
done
anything,
it's
somehow
a
party
again
when
the
notice
of
appeal
is
filed.
and
the
government's
position
is
that
just
where
it
does
not
come
into
the
case
and
doesn't
intervene,
it's
not
a
party
for
any
of
those
purposes.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
think
there
are
two
distinct
harms,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
is
to
the
government,
and
the
second
is
to
congress
and
the
system
it
set
up
in
the
statute.
the
harm
to
the
government
is
that,
if
it
can
be
made
a
party
under
frap
4,
despite
the
fact
that
it
has
actively
attempted
to
decline
party
status,
it
could
also
be
made
a
party
under
the
other
rule.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
don't
think
the
government
has
any
objection
in
theory
to
a
period
of
60
days
for
only
frap
4.
i
think
the
difficulty
is
that
any
number
of
rules
speak
in
terms
of
parties.
and
petitioners
advance
no
persuasive
between
frap
4
and
other
rules.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
that's
right.
three
brief
points,
i
think.
first,
if
this
court
announces
a
30-day
rule,
that's
clear
going
forward.
relators
and
their
counsel
will
treat
declined
qui
tam
suits
like
civil
actions
generally
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party.
second,
if
the
rules
are
better
read
for
a
30-day
period,
because
the
united
states
was
not
a
party,
you're
entitled
to
appeal
the
judgment,
then
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
assume
that
he
would
get
60
days--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
i
think
they
also
were
on
notice
that
there's
a
long-standing
circuit
split
on
this
question
which
the
court
has
never
answered.
given
the
fact
that
what
you're
talking
about
is
a
ministerial
task,
filing
a
one-page
notice,
there
are
actually
federal
court
manuals
that
instruct
in
this
circumstance
relator's
counsel
to
file
within
the
30
days.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
right,
and--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
and
that
goes
to
a
question
that
justice
breyer
asked
earlier.
the
statute,
2107,
was
enacted
after
what
is
now
frap
4.
the
rule
and
the
statute
shortened
the
period
to
appeal
from
3
months
to
30
days.
and
then
the
judicial
conference,
in
the
--
in
the
--
what
is
now
frap
4,
drew
the
exception
of
60
days
for
cases
in
which
the
united
states
was
a
party
because
of
an
express
need
for
more
time
for
the
solicitor
general
to
make
a
decision.
the
judicial
conference
raised
some
question
about
how
we
do
that.
two
years
later
congress
enacted
the
statute
putting
in
the
30-day
and
60-day
rules.
i
think
then
that's
a
baseline.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
advisory
committee
could
come
back
and
effectively
amend
the
--
amend
the
statute
by
changing
the
rule.
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
2107
was
if
the
--
if
the
--
the
united
states
is
a
potential
appellant
and
requires
more
time
to
conduct
its
internal
decisionmaking
processes,
it
gets
60
days.
otherwise,
that
30-day
baseline
governs,
and
i
respectfully
disagree,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
congress
was
not
concerned
about
moving
appeals
forward
expeditiously.
it
shortened
the
period
from
three
months
to
30
days
precisely
because
of
wanting
judgments
to
become
final.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
guess
--
and
i
--
the
same
answer
i
gave
earlier,
justice
scalia:
that's
equally
true
virtually
in
any
federal
case
that
might
affect
the
united
states's
interests--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--but
i
think
it
goes
back
to
what
justice
ginsburg
asked
much
earlier,
which
is:
at
the
time
the
judgment
is
entered,
who
is
a
party
entitled
to
take
the
appeal?
if
the
united
states
has
done
nothing,
it's
not
a
potential
appellant.
when
the
30-day
period
runs,
the
case
is
over,
and
the
united
states,
if
it
wants
to--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--it
can
intervene.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
it
is
--
yes,
and
it
is
--
it
is
equally
true
that
it
is
a
potential
appellant
then
in
any
case
that
might
affect
its
interests.
but
we
do
not
commonly
consider
the
united
states
a
party
to
every
class
action
settlement
or
in
every
government
contractor
suit
simply
based
on
the
possibility
that
it
may
want
to
intervene.
when
it
does
so
very
rarely
--
we're
talking
about
--
i
mean
that
is
the
exceptionally
rare
case
in
the
false
claims
act,
and
the
government
is
saying,
we
can
make
that
decision
within
the
30
days
because
we
are
not
a
party
to
the
judgment
at
the
time
it's
entered.
and,
again,
i
think
what
petitioner
strains
to
do
when
he
says
at
page
25
of
his
reply
brief
that
when
you
decline
as
the
government,
you
avoid
the
burdens
of
party
status.
what
petitioner
can't
explain
is
why
that
is
any
different
for
the
burden
of
appealing
an
adverse
judgment
and
the
burdens
of
discovery.
all
of
those
rules
speak
in
terms
of
party
status.
if
petitioner
is
able
to
foist
on
the
government
a
status
that
it
actively
attempted
to
decline,
as
was
its
right
afforded
it
by
congress,
then
it
seems
to
me
petitioner
can
equally
try
to
foist
on
the
government,
though
it
doesn't
here,
in
future
cases
party
status.
and
this
court
will
have
to
decide
case
by
case:
is
the
united
states
a
party
for
purposes
of
each
rule
of
civil
and
appellate
procedure?
and
i
think
that
approach
threatens
much
more
uncertainty
than
the
approach
the
government
is
outlining
where
intervention
is
a
simple,
workable,
administrable
test
to
determine
whether
the
united
states
is
a
party
to
a
qui
tam
suit.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
thank
you.
