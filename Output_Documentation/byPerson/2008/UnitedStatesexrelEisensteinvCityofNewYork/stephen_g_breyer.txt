justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
--
what
about
the
case
that
they
were
talking
about,
so
the
relator's
pursuing
a
case,
that
case
is
over,
and
they're
not
going
to
appeal
because
they
don't
have
any
money
left,
whatever
it
is;
but
the
government
looks
at
that
judgment
and
thinks,
oh,
god,
there's
something
wrong
with
this
one,
i
better
appeal
it.
that's
the
government
lawyer
speaking.
now,
they're
supposed
to
have
60
days
to
figure
that
one
out,
and
you'll
take
that
60
away
from
them
because
they'll
have
to
do
this
whole
thing
in
30.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
because
they
didn't
expect--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
judge
did
--
the
judge
did
a
surprising
thing,
which
judges
sometimes
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
this
be
a
solution
which
wouldn't
help
you?
you
would
say,
well,
there's
some
factors
here
cut
one
way,
and
there's
some
that
cut
the
other
way,
and
some
circuits
have
said
the
government
should
have
the
60
days,
and
those
cases
are
already
proceeding.
so
it's
best
to
keep
it
where
it
is,
which
is
60
days,
and
then
suggest
the
rules
committee
look
into
this,
since
we
don't
actually--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
it
--
all
right.
and
the
rules
committee
would
looked
into
it
if
it's
a
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
know.
that's
repeating
your
argument.
and
i'm
suggesting
what
would
be
wrong
with
the
view
that
you
lose
because
of
the
reasons
i
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
it
also
a
party
under
all
these
other
rules?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
under
all
of
the
rules
of
discovery?
