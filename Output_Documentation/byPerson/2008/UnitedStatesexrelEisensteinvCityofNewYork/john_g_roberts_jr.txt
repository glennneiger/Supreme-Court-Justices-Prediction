chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-660,
united
states,
ex
rel.
eisenstein
v.
the
city
of
new
york.
mr.
schor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
wouldn't
have
to
--
you
wouldn't
have
to
do
anything
like
that
at
all.
he
would
just
file
before
30
days
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side.
it's
not
like
he's
going
to
say,
i'm
going
to
analyze
this
100-page
document
to
see
whether
i
get
an
extra
30
days
to
do
something
as
simple
as
filing
a
notice
of
appeal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
--
and
if
the
inquiry
says
it's
hard
to
tell,
there's
a
30-day
limit
and
there's
a
60
day
limit,
i
don't
know
of
any
responsible
counsel
who
wouldn't
file
within
30
days.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
would
that
--
why
would
it
--
i
mean,
it
would
still
apply
to
the
government
or
any
case
in
which
the
government
is
a
party,
where
it's
not
an
issue
whether
is
the
government
a
party
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no,
no,
no,
i
agree
with
you
that
it
--
i'm
just
saying
why
in
a
world
would
the
relator
want
to
invoke
the
60-day
provision
if
there's
at
all
--
at
all
a
question
about
whether
it's
30
days
or
60
days?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
yes,
but
--
you
don't
have
to
know
that
before
you
file
the
one-page
notice
of
appeal.
i
mean,
if
you
need
more
time,
you
can
get
more
time,
but
you
don't
have
to
know
all
of
that.
it's
not
going
to
cost
you
a
lot
of
money
to
file
the
notice
of
appeal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
there
may
be
--
there
may
be
a
lot
of
reasons
the
relator
will
not
pursue
an
appeal.
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
that
the
relator
would
not
file
a
notice
of
appeal
within
30
days
or,
if
he
doesn't
like
30
days,
you
ask
for
an
extension
of
time
for
another
30
days.
then
the
whole
issue
is
moot.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rephen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
certainly
a
trap
for
the
unaware,
right?
i
mean,
every
lawyer
loves
to
win
on
a
technicality,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
says
if
the
united
states
is
a
party,
it
is
--
it
is
60;
if
it's
not,
it's
30.
and
you
have
got
a
situation
where
the
united
states
--
the
action
is
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know,
but
this
is
such
a
--
such
a
trap
for
the
unwary
that
you
never
even
raise
this
point.
it
was
raised
sua
sponte
by
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
my
point
is
if
it
didn't
occur
to
you,
how
can
you
claim
that
it
should
definitely
have
occurred
to
your
friend
on
the
other
side?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
about
--
i'm
sorry.
why
don't
you
finish,
counselor?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
how
does
it
work
in
--
presumably,
i
guess
the
government
can
decide
that
it
wants
to
appeal
the
case
in
which
it
has
not
participated
below,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
has
to
move
to
intervene.
so
let's
say
there's
a
judgment
and
the
government
looks
at
it
and
says:
well,
we
didn't
know
we
would
get
a
decision
like
this;
we've
got
to
appeal
this.
the
relator
doesn't
want
to
appeal
it.
30
days
goes
by.
the
government
moves
to
intervene
because
it
has
60
days.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
for
all
the
reasons
in
the
legislative
history
that
you
discussed
about
why
the
government
gets
more
time,
those
reasons
don't
apply
in
that
situation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
--
i
pressed
your
friend
about
what's
the
big
deal,
why
don't
you
just
file
within
30.
it
only
seems
fair
to
press
you
on
what's
the
big
deal
with
letting
them
have
for
60--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--which
also
solves
the
problem
of
the
potential
trap
for
the
unwary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
agree
with
that.
i
agree
with
that.
but
what
if
we
say--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
what
if
i
say,
or
whoever
is
writing
the
opinion
says,
this
is
only
for
purposes
of
filing
the
appeal?
we
don't
decide
whether
the
government
is
a
party
in
all
these
other
characteristics,
but
whether
it
comes
to
rule
4(a)--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it
should
be
construed
narrowly.
i
don't
think
saying
whether
it's
30
or
60
days
at
all
implicates
that
principle.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
yeah,
but
i
mean,
if
we
assume
you're
right,
then
that's
construing
it
narrowly.
but
the
whole
question
is
that
there's
some
confusion
in
the
rule
about
who's
right,
and
all
i'm
saying
is
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
the
easiest
thing
to
avoid
any
trap
for
the
unwary
with
no
consequences
on
the
other
side,
to
say
60
days.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
this
isn't
going
to
delay
appeals,
for
heaven's
sakes.
i
mean,
there's
all
sorts
of
scheduling
rules
about
the
timing
of
the
briefs
and
everybody
gets
an
extension
on
their
briefs.
this
is
going
to
have
no
effect
whatever
on
how
quickly
appeals
move
along.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
wall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
why
do
you
care?
i
mean,
you're
just
giving
people
who
might
well
be
confused
by
this
provision
another
30
days.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay,
but,
again,
we
would
limit
any
decision
to
federal
rule
of
appeal
4
because
of
the
dramatically
adverse
consequences
for
the
unwary.
they
lose
their
right
to
pursue
their
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
just
does
did.
under
frap
4,
you're
out
the
door
without
any
hearing
on
the
merits.
it's
a
technicality.
the
spirit
of
the
rules
is
that
we
don't
throw
people
out
because
of
mere
technicalities.
now,
failure
to
file
a
timely
notice
of
appeal
is
not
a
technicality
in
terms
of
the
consequences.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sure
that
the
appellate
rules
advisory
committee,
when
they
hear
this
decision,
if
they
haven't
already,
will
put
something
in
the
rules
about
whether
it's
30
days
or
60
days.
so
i'm
not
terribly
concerned
about
clarity
going
forward.
it's
going
to
be
made
clear
by
the
advisory
committee
and
the
submission
of
new
rules,
and
i
see
no
reason
that
they
wouldn't
make
it
clear.
i
don't
know
whether
they'll
think
30
or
60
is
the
best
idea.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
just
a
question
of
--
in
this
case
and,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
what
the
effect
is
going
to
be
on
other
cases.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
that
situation,
60
days
makes
the
most
sense
because
otherwise
you're
disrupting
the
system
solely
based
on
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
wall.
mr.
schor,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-660,
united
states
ex
rel.
eisenstein
versus
the
city
of
new
york.
