justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
don't
say
the
--
i
mean,
nothing
in
the
resolution
and
nothing
in
the
--
does
anything
in
the
court's
opinion
or
the
resolution
say
that
the
claims
are
valid?
we
all
know
they
have
claims.
they
have
been
making
claims.
is
there
anything
in
any
document
i
have
that
says
the
claims
are
valid
claims?
maybe
they
are
valid,
and
maybe
they
are
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
they
think
they
are
valid.
[laughter]
but
i
mean
--
so
--
so
since
you
have
normally
one
group
thinks
they
are
valid;
another
group
thinks
they
are
invalid.
well,
here
we
are.
let
them
fight
it
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
all
we
can
say
is
that
this
resolution
of
the
apology
doesn't
really
say
who's
right.
and
if
hawaii
wants
to
give
some
more
money,
or
whatever
they
want
to
do,
to
the
native
hawaiians,
that's
their
affair.
what's
the
--
what's
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
the
hawaiian
legislature
pass
a
law
saying
the
native
hawaiians
had
claims?
those
claims,
because
of
the
federal
1950
--
whatever
it
is
--
are
not
valid
anymore.
but
that
was
pretty
unfair
to
them,
and,
therefore,
what
we
think
we
should
do
is
the
following.
and
then
they
pass
a
whole
lot
of
things
that
they
think
would
be
appropriate
to
do
in
light
of
what
i
just
said.
what
stops
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
concede
--
you
concede
that
the
apology
resolution
does
not
say
that
the
hawaiian
people's
claims
are
valid.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
say
that?
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
if
that's
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
you
object
to
a
three-sentence
per
curiam
opinion
in
this
case
where
we
say,
to
the
extent
that
the
hawaii
supreme
court
could
be
read
to
suggest
that
the
apology
resolution
either
resolved
or
cast
a
cloud,
legally
speaking,
on
the
title
of
the
trust
land,
or
suggested
in
any
way
that
land
be
enjoined
--
the
sale
be
enjoined,
the
court
made
a
mistake;
and
insofar
as
it
is
resting
on
state
law,
that's
up
to
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
it
have
done
that?
i
mean,
i
didn't
see
anything
in
here
that
suggests
anything
like
that.
that's
to
suggest
that
the
apology
resolution
created
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
courts
to
enjoin
sales
until
everything
was
worked
out.
now,
i
have
read
this
apology
resolution
about
six
times,
and
i
certainly
didn't
see
anything
like
that.
where
does
it
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
agree
that
the
apology
resolution
does
not
say
who's
right
about
the
claim?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
like
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
i
said
that
just
in
the
opinion
and
said
just
what
you
said,
and
nothing
else
about
the
resolution,
say
we
don't
see
any
other
way
in
which
the
resolution
could
have
supported
this,
would
that
--
is
that
okay
with
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
also,
i
guess,
has
a
--
there
--
in
the
admission
resolution,
it
set
up
a
trust.
they
hold
it
in
trust,
and
there
are
five
purposes
in
the
trust,
and
only
one
of
those
relates
to
the
native
hawaiians.
now,
i
know
from
the
newspapers
--
i
don't
know
the
merits
of
it
--
but
the
trust
that
has
been
set
up
is
the
subject
of
controversy
continuously.
so
what
i
don't
see
--
and
i
hope
we
don't
have
to
get
into
this
--
is
what
the
relation
between
the
trust
principles
as
enacted
in
the
legislature
is
and
the
trust
principles
set
forth
in
the
admissions
resolution.
is
there
any
law
going
to
anything
like
that?
