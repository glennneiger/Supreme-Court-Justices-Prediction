justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
that
would
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it
violate
the
admission
act
if
the
legislature
did
not
--
said
--
said
we
are
giving
it
to
them
because
we
want
to,
because
we
think
it's
a
good
idea.
no,
we
are
giving
it
to
them
because
we
think
they
have
a
right
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
feel
that
we
must
give
it
to
them
because
it's
theirs.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
violate
the
admission
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
answer
my
question
just
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
please,
let
me
put
my
question
again.
let's
assume
that
the
legislature
does
not
say,
we
want
to
give
it
to
the
native
hawaiians
because
we
like
the
native
hawaiians
or
because
we
think
they
deserve
it;
but,
rather,
we
think
we
have
to
give
it
to
the
native
hawaiians
because
it's
theirs.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
would
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
--
is
it
the
function
of
the
hawaiian
supreme
court
to
declare
moral
obligations?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
there
be
any
problem
--
certainly
there
is
none
if
the
legislature
deems
there
to
be
a
moral
obligation
and
gives
the
land
away
on
that
basis.
but
do
you
--
do
you
think
there
--
there
might
be
some
democracy
problem
if
--
if
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
goes
around
pronouncing
moral
obligations
and
giving
away
land
on
that
basis?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
doesn't
the
hawaii
supreme
court's
reliance
upon
hawaiian
law
to
establish
that
there
is
some
property
right
on
the
part
of
these
native
hawaiians
--
why
doesn't
that
conflict
with
federal
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
what
you
call
it;
it's
a
property
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
read
the
federal
law,
it
extinguished
all
property
rights
in
these
lands;
the
lands
were
transferred
to
the
federal
government;
and
the
federal
government
transferred
them
in
absolute
fee
without
any
encumbrances
to
the
state
of
hawaii.
now,
if
you
are
telling
me
the
hawaii
supreme
court
is
now
finding
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
there
is
a
property
interest
on
the
part
of
the
native
hawaiians
--
i
don't
care
what
you
call
it,
equitable
or
whatever
--
it
seems
to
me
that
is
in
flat
contradiction
of
federal
law,
and
probably
is
an
issue
that
we
ought
to
address
in
this
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
they
do
nothing
at
all?
could
i
get
back
to
justice
breyer's
three-sentence
per
curiam,
where
we
just
say
to
the
extent
that
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
relied
upon
the
apology
resolution
as
creating
any
--
any
property
entitlement
in
the
hawaiians,
it
was
in
error.
okay,
we
send
it
back
to
the
hawaiian
supreme
court,
and
the
hawaii
supreme
court
smiles
and
doesn't
do
a
blessed
thing,
leaves
--
leaves
the
injunction
against
any
distribution
of
the
land
in
effect.
what
--
what
happens
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
we
said
"to
the
extent
that".
i
mean,
if
we
said
it's
--
it's
grounded
on
the
proposition
that
the
apology
resolution
creates
property
rights
and
that's
wrong,
then
they'd
have
to
do
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
we
just
said,
to
the
extent
that
it
may
be
grounded
on
that,
we
take
no
position
on
whether
it's
grounded
on
that
or
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
would
that
require
any
action
on
their
part?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
court
the
trustee?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
is
the
trustee.
so
i
assume
it
would
be
up
to
the
state
officers
to
decide
to
what
extent
the
obligation
to
the
hawaiians,
among
the
five
obligations,
should
be
given
precedence.
is
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
directing
the
state
officers
to
give
it
precedence?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
saying
that
the
trustee
must
direct
it
primarily
to
--
to
that
among
the
five
ends.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
all
this
comes
from
the
fact
that
congress
made
reference
to
and
approved
a
so-called
reconciliation
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
in
--
in
perpetuam,
this
land
can't
be
transferred
because
congress
approved
the
this
reconciliation
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
denying
it
to
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
quite
understand.
you
mean
--
you
mean
a
federal
court
can
enjoin
the
sale
of
my
house,
and
there's
nothing
i
can
do
about
it
inasmuch
as
i
do
not
have
any
present
intention
of
selling
my
house--
justice
antonin
scalia
--except
to
live
under
that
injunction?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
you
--
you
say
there
is
no
controversy,
so
i
--
i
cannot
get
its
validity
adjudicated,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
the
state
has
to
have
an
immediate
intention
to
sell
any
particular
piece
of
land
in
order
to
object
to
an
injunction
against
any
sale
of
land
by
the
state
in
the
future.
i
--
i
don't
think
it
has
to
wait
until
it
--
it
wants
to
sell
a
particular
plot.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
there
is.
the
state
says,
i
am
free
to
sell
the
land,
and
--
and
the
court
says,
no,
you
are
not.
isn't
that
a
dispute?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shanmugam,
you
--
you
didn't
raise
in
--
in
your
opposition
to
the
petition
the
--
the
question
of
mootness.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
have
to
preserve
it.
i
mean,
it's
--
it's
an
issue
of
article
iii
jurisdiction,
so
we'd
have
to
look
into
it
on
our
--
on
our
own.
but
it
does
suggest
that
it
is
not
a
very
strong
string
to
your
bow,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way.
