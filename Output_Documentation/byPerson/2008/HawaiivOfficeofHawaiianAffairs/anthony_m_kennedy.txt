but
would
the
state
of
hawaii,
under
hawaii
law,
be
entitled
to
take
the
position,
if
it
so
chose,
that
as
the
new
owner
of
the
lands,
it
has
a
special
duty
as
a
trustee
that
some
other
owner
might
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
--
then
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
the
hawaiian
supreme
court
--
assuming
that
it
made
the
decision
that
i
hypothetically
stated
--
whether
the
hawaiian
supreme
court,
as
opposed
to
the
hawaiian
legislature,
could
make
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
is
some
special
trust
obligation
imposed
on
the
state
of
hawaii
by
reason
of
its
own
duties.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
prudent
when
the
great
bulk
of
the
opinion
is
based
on
the
apology
resolution.
and
i
--
i
certainly
do
think
you
have
a
powerful
argument
that
the
apology
resolution
presents
us
with
a
federal
question.
but
the
more
far-reaching
question,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggests,
might
not
even
be
very
specifically
within
the
question
presented,
and
even
if
it's
fairly
embraced,
you
used
the
word
"prudent".
it
seems
prudent
for
us
to
confine
our
decision
to
the
effect
of
the
apology
resolution
and
whether
or
not
the
hawaiian
supreme
court
got
that
part
of
it
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
agree
that
there
would
be
a
federal
question
if
the
hawaiian
supreme
court
said
the
apology
resolution
dictates
our
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
whole
case
rests
on
a
cloud
on
title
in
favor
of
your
clients.
but
you
ignore
the
cloud
on
title
that
has
been
entered
against
the
state.
