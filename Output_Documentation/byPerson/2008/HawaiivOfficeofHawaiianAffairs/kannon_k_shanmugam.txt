mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
only
issue
properly
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
hawaii
supreme
court
concluded
that
the
apology
resolution
created
an
affirmative
federal
obligation
not
to
sell
ceded
lands.
in
our
view,
it
did
not.
the
hawaii
supreme
court
held
only
that
the
sale
of
ceded
lands
would
breach
the
state's
fiduciary
duty
to
native
hawaiians
under
state
law.
and
it
relied
on
the
apology
resolution
only
for
its
recognition
that
native
hawaiians
have
claims
to
the
ceded
lands
that
are
currently
being
addressed
through
the
political
process.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
then
the
court
should
vacate
and
remand.
but
we
believe
that
the
better
interpretation
of
the
hawaii
supreme
court's
opinion
is
that
it
believed
that
the
source
of
the
fiduciary
duty
at
issue
was
state
law
and
not
federal
law.
to
be
sure--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--as
the
source
for
fiduciary
duty?
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
the
source
for
the
fiduciary
duty,
according
to
the
hawaii
supreme
court,
was
state
law.
to
the
extent
that
the
hawaii
supreme
court
relied
on--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--they
did
say
at
various
points
in
the
opinion
that
the
apology
resolution,
together
with
state
law,
gave
rise
to
the
fiduciary
duty.
but
i
think
that
if
one
looks
at
the
critical
portion
of
the
hawaii
supreme
court's
opinion,
on
pages
31a
to
32a,
where
the
hawaii
supreme
court
actually
discusses
the
relevance
of
the
apology
resolution,
the
court
makes
clear
that
it
is
relying
on
it
only
for
the
acknowledgment
that
native
hawaiians
have
unresolved
claims,
and--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
it
was
more
than
mere
window
dressing,
justice
ginsburg.
the
apology
resolution
really
did
confirm
the
factual
predicate
for
respondent's
state
law
claims.
and
i
do
mean
to
emphasize
that
these
have
been
state
law
claims
from
the
outset.
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
original
complaint
in
this
case,
which
is
found
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
34a
to
36a,
the
only
source
of
law
on
which
we
rely
for
the
counts
at
issue
here
was
article
12,
section
4--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--of
the
hawaii
constitution.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
let
me
--
let
me
be
clear
about
this,
justice
ginsburg,
if
the
hawaii
supreme
court's
opinion
is
read
to
construe
the
apology
resolution
as
creating
some
affirmative
duty
or
obligation
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
we
agree
that
that
would
be
erroneous.
and
if
the
court--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--no,
because
we
believe
that
read
in
context,
justice
kennedy,
that
that
statement
is
consistent
with
our
theory
of
the
hawaii
supreme
court's
reliance
on
the
apology
resolution.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
the
hawaii
supreme
court
relied
on
hawaii
law
only
for
the
existence
of
a
fiduciary
duty,
and
that
fiduciary
duty
has
repeatedly
been
recognized
by
the
hawaii
supreme
court.
that
duty
gives
native
hawaiians
an
equitable
or
a
beneficial
interest
in
these
lands.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--there
are
two
separate
issues,
justice
scalia.
the
first
is
what
was
the
source
for
the
injunction
in
this
case.
and
the
source
of
the
injunction
was
respondents'
instant
claims
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
now,
to
be
sure,
we
were
arguing
that
there
would
be
a
breach
of
the
fiduciary
duty
to
native
hawaiians
precisely
because
native
hawaiians
have
underlying
claims
to
the
lands.
and
it's
those
underlying
claims
that
trigger
all
of
these
additional
federal
issues
that
petitioners
are
now
seeking
to
inject
into
the
case.
but
i
think
that
the
critical
point
for
purposes
of
this
court's
review
at
this
stage
is
that
in
the
hawaii
supreme
court,
we
freely
and
repeatedly
conceded
that
any
underlying
claims
to
the
ceded
lands
would
be
nonjusticiable.
that
much
was
clear
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
the
apology
resolution--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--does
not
directly
speak
to
the
merits
of
any
underlying
claims,
whether--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--or
otherwise.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
--
i
think
so,
with
one
caveat
and
i
don't
mean
to
quibble--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i
think
we
would
acquiesce
in
that
with
one
small
quibble,
which
is
that
i
think
that
the
issue
that
is
being
debated
here
is
not
whether
the
hawaii
supreme
court
relied
on
the
apology
resolution
as
creating
some
cloud
on
title.
precisely
because
we
conceded
below
that
the
underlying
claims
were
nonjusticiable,
the
hawaii
supreme
court
did
not
opine
on
the
merits
of
those
underlying
claims.
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
hawaii
supreme
court
believed
that
the
apology
resolution
created
a
fiduciary
obligation
to
essentially
preserve
and
protect
the
ceded
lands,
until
those
underlying--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--yes.
and
we
agree
that
the
apology
resolution
cannot
be
read
to
create
some
affirmative
duty
not
to
sell
the
ceded
lands,
but--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--no.
there
are
various
--
there
are
various
findings
in
the
apology
resolution
that
could
potentially
be
relevant
to
the
ultimate
disposition
of
the
land.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
it
is,
after
all,
significant
that
congress--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--congress
expressed
its
support
for
the
reconciliation
process,
justice
breyer,
and
that
would
provide
an
obvious
boost
in
the
hawaii
legislature
for
the
ultimate
resolution
of
those
claims.
and
it's
really
for
that
reason,
to
get
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
and
we
feel
it's
important.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
yes.
i
think
that's
it.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
and
it's
for
that
reason,
justice
ginsburg,
that
we
freely
concede
that
if
the
hawaii
supreme
court
had
relied
on
the
apology
resolution
as
creating
some
federal
duty,
that
would
be
problematic.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
we
certainly
do
not--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
it's
hard
to
say
because
it
would
depend
on
how
they
relied
on
them,
but
i
think
that
the
critical
point--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
don't
think
that
those
federal
acts
could
be
read
as
creating
a
fiduciary
duty
not
to
sell
the
ceded
lands.
so
i
think
i
would
concede
that
that
would
be
problematic
as
well.
but
i
think
that
the
question
before
the
court
according
to
petitioners
is
whether
an
injunction,
even
if
that
injunction
were
framed
solely
in
terms
of
state
law,
might
itself
contravene
the
newlands
resolution
by
virtue
of--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
think
that
that
is
right
in
the
sense
that
we
certainly
think
that
the
hawaii
supreme
court
in
the
first
place
intended
to
rely
on
a
state
law
of
fiduciary
duty.
and
we
would
certainly
have
no
problem
with
and
indeed
would
welcome
a
remand
that
afforded
the
hawaii
supreme
court
the
opportunity
to
do
what
we
think
they
did
in
the
first
place--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
don't
think
they
would
do
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
on
remand,
i
think
that
they
would
consider
the
issue
of
whether
the
injunction
could
be
grounded
on
state
law,
which
after
all
was
the
basis
of
our
complaint
from
day
one
in
this
case.
and
there
is
certainly
language--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
presumably--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--presumably,
justice
scalia--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--if
the
court
were
to
write
that
opinion,
i
assume
that
the
last
line
of
the
opinion
would
be
to
vacate
and
remand,
and
that
would
eliminate
the
injunction,
and
so
the
hawaii
supreme
court
would
have
the
case
once
again;
and
at
that
point
the
hawaii
supreme
court
could
clarify
that
the
source
of
the
fiduciary
duty
at
issue
was
state
law.
and--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--and
if
the
hawaii
supreme
court
on
remand,
mr.
chief
justice,
addressed
the
merits
of
any
underlying
legal
claims,
then
this
court
could
review
the
decision,
and
at
that
point
it
might
have
some
sense
of,
for
instance,
what
those
legal
claims
actually
are.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
that
is
presumably
always
true,
but,
you
know,
i
think
for
purposes
of
the
current
posture
of
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
only
federal
issue
that
is
before
the
court
is
the
question
of
whether
the
apology
resolution
was
the
source
of
the
underlying
obligation.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
petitioners
did
not--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--the
--
the
apology
resolution
in
this
case
does
not
speak
directly
to
the
merits
of
any
underlying
claims.
what
it
does
do
is
recognize
that
the
overthrow
of
the
kingdom
of
hawaii
was
illegal,
apologized
for
the
federal
government's
involvement
in
that
overthrow,
and,
in
the
operative
provisions
of
the
resolution,
expresses
support
for
the
reconciliation
process.
and
it
is
that
expression
of
support
on
which
the
hawaii
supreme
court
critically
relied
here
in
informing
its
application
of
state
law.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
yes,
that
would
be
okay,
justice
breyer,
and
i
do
think
that
it
would
be
important
for
this
court
to
make
clear
that
to
the
extent
that
the
hawaii
supreme
court,
in
any
subsequent
remand,
relies
on
the
apology
resolution
only
for
what
are
essentially
factual
findings,
its
acknowledgment
that
native
hawaiians
have
unrelinquished
claims,
which
is
undoubtedly
true
as
a
factual
matter
--
i
don't
hear
petitioners
to
suggest
otherwise
--
and
its
recognition
that
there
is
an
ongoing
reconciliation
process,
that
is
entirely
proper.
and
the
hawaii
supreme
court--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
that
is
essentially--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--but
the
hawaii
supreme
court,
in
the
opinion
under
review,
did
not
ground
that
duty
on
any
judgment
about
the
validity
of
the
original
conveyance
of
title.
they
grounded
it--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--but
i
do
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
is
an
entirely
discrete
question
from
the
question
presented,
and
it's
entirely
discrete
precisely
because
this
argument
concerning
the
newlands
resolution
could
have
arisen,
even
if
the
injunction
were,
as
we
believe
it
was,
unambiguously
based
solely
on
state
law
with
nary
a
reference
to
the
apology
resolution.
and
it
is
precisely--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that's
correct.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
yes,
that's
right.
it
comes
out
of
--
i
think
it's
hawaii
revised
statute
10-13.5,
and
as
a
matter
of
state
law
they
get
20
percent
of
the
revenue
from
the
ceded-lands
trust,
though
the
amount
of
that
revenue
has
itself
been
the
subject
of
protracted
and
unresolved
litigation.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
the
valuation
of
the
leiali'i
parcel
was
challenged
in
this
litigation,
and
it
remains
pending
before
the
trial
court.
but,
i
think,
more
broadly
the
important
point
is
that
to
the
extent
that
the
injunction
in
this
case
was
based
on
the
lack
of
resolution
of
underlying
claims
in
the
state
political
process,
the
hawaii
legislature
could
readily
resolve
those
claims
without
in
any
way
casting
any
doubt
on
the
validity
of
the
original
conveyance
of
lands
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
no
--
but
let
me
say
something
about
that,
because
i
do
think
that
it
is
relevant
to
our
interpretation
of
the
hawaii
supreme
court's
opinion.
what
the
state
of
hawaii
did
with
article
12,
section
4
of
the
hawaii
constitution
was
essentially
to
say
that,
while
the
state
does
have
some
discretion
to
use
the
assets
in
the
section
5(f)
ceded-lands
trust
for
any
of
the
stated
purposes,
the
state
owes
a
particularly
high
duty
to
native
hawaiians.
the
hawaii
supreme
court
has
so
construed
article
12,
section
4
in
other
cases
involving
the
ceded-lands
trust.
and,
at
page
39a
of
its
opinion
in
this
case,
the
hawaii
supreme
court
plainly
relied
on
that
provision
as
a
source
of
its
fiduciary
duty,
the
fiduciary
duty
that
we
believe
was
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
opinion
does
not
cite
that
provision
in
so
many
words,
but
it
refers
to
the
hawaii
constitution
in
a
case
construing
that
provision.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
the
state
is
the
trustee.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
article
12,
section
4,
we
would
respectfully
submit,
justice
scalia,
does
place
native
hawaiians
in
something
of
a
privileged
position
vis-a-vis
the
other
beneficiaries.
and
in
construing
article
12,
section
4,
the
hawaii
supreme
court
was
doing,
albeit
in
a
somewhat
unusual
context,
what
courts
do
every
day,
which
is
essentially
to
evaluate
whether
the
trustee
is
acting
consistent
with
the
trustee's
obligations
under
the
terms
of
the
trust.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
all
that
the
hawaii
supreme
court
said
was,
in
light
of
the
very
realistic
prospect
that
lands
may
be
returned
to
native
hawaiians
as
part
of
the
reconciliation
process
that
congress
recognized
in
the
apology
resolution,
it
would
constitute
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
to
sell
those
lands
for
another
trust
purpose,
for
the
simple
reason
that
once
those
lands
are
gone,
they
are
gone
forever.
and
that
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
general
principle
of
trust
law,
that
a
trustee
in
exercising
its
discretion--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
congress
did
support
that--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--only
until
the
claims
of
the
native
hawaiians
are
resolved.
and
what
is
clear--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--regardless
of
the
degree
of
reliance
upon
the
apology
resolution,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
hawaii
legislature
has
substantial
discretion
to
act
and
to
act
in
a
way
that
essentially
vacates
the
terms
of
the
injunction.
so
if
the
hawaii
legislature
either
says,
we're
going
to
reach
a
definitive
resolution
of
the
underlying
claims
of
native
hawaiians
by
giving
them
land
or
additional
monetary
compensation,
or
the
hawaii
supreme
court
determines
that--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--or
denying
it
to
them.
then
presumably,
according
to
the
terms
of
the
injunction,
it
would
no
longer
have
any
force.
so
the
hawaii
legislature
remains
empowered
to
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
get
out
from
under
the
terms
of
the
injunction
to
the
extent
they
are
restrictive.
i
would
note,
however,
parenthetically,
that
immediately
after
this
litigation
was
commenced
the
hawaii
department
of
land
and
natural
resources
imposed
a
unilateral
moratorium
on
the
sale
of
ceded
lands.
that
moratorium,
as
an
executive
matter,
has
remained
in
effect
during
the
14-year
pendency
of
this
litigation,
even
during
the
considerable
period
between
the
trial
court's
ruling
in
favor
of
petitioners
and
the
hawaii
supreme
court's
ruling
in
our
favor.
so
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
great
impetus
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
sell
ceded
lands.
indeed,
governor
lingle,
one
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
has
recently
and
repeatedly
made
statements
to
the
effect
that
the
state
has
no
intention
to
sell
ceded
lands.
and
if
that
is
really
the
state's
position
--
and
i
would
be
very
interested
in
my
friend
general
bennett's
views
on
the
matter
--
then
it
would
seem
that
there
really
is
no
case
or
controversy
before
this
court
at
all.
because
if
the
state
has
no
intention
to
sell
ceded
lands
and
the
sale
of
ceded
lands
was
the
instigating
event
for
this
litigation,
there
would
not
necessarily
be
any
real
dispute
between
the
parties.
i
--
i
want
to
say
just,
you
know,
one
more
word--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--the
petition
would
be
dismissed
under
munsingwear.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
yes.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
if
there
is,
in
fact,
mootness.
and
if
there
were
--
if
the
state
--
if
the
state
had
not
intention
to
sell
ceded
lands,
presumably
the
underlying
dispute
would
be
moot.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
if--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--if
a
federal
court
enjoined
you
from
selling
your
house
without
any
underlying
legal
authority
for
doing
so,
presumably
that
injunction
would
be
invalid.
but
the
critical
point
here--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
here
the
lawsuit
was
commenced
by
respondents,
because
respondents
believed
that
the
state
was
going
to
imminently
sell
the
leiali'i
parcel.
that
was
the
triggering
event
for
this
litigation.
it
now
appears
at
--
at
least
possible
that
the
state
has
no
intention
to
sell
even
that
parcel,
and
if
that
were
true--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
it
just
--
it
merely
suggests
that
the
--
that
there
is
no
longer
an
underlying
dispute,
justice
scalia.
because,
again--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
--
i
think
that
there
is
--
you
know,
there
was
a
case
or
controversy
as
this
case
came
to
the
court
in
the
article
iii
sense
precisely
because
there
was
a
dispute
between
the
parties
about--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
first
of
all,
our
whole
theory
has
never
been
that
there
is
a
cloud
on
title.
now,
to
be
sure,
we
have
maintained
at
various
points
in
this
litigation
that
native
hawaiians
do
have
potentially
valid
legal
claims,
as
well
as
moral
and
political
claims,
to
the
underlying
lands.
but
we
have
never
argued
that
the
injunction
in
this
case
should
be
based
on
some
assessment
of
the
existence
or
validity
of
legal
claims.
to
the
contrary,
we
have
consistently
taken
the
position
--
and
this
is
clear
from
our
briefs
before
the
hawaii
supreme
court
--
that
any
such
underlying
claims
would
be
nonjusticiable.
and
for
that
reason
all
that
we
were
seeking
was
an
injunction
to
protect
these
lands
until
those
claims
could
be
resolved
through
the
political
process.
that
was
all
that
we
were
seeking
below,
and
the
hawaii
legislature
again
could
readily
resolve
those
underlying
claims
without
in
any
way
casting
doubt
on
the
validity
of
the
newlands
resolution
or
any
other
federal
enactment
that
purports
to
recognize
absolute
title--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--in
the
ceded
lands.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
a
lot
of
money
was
sunk
into
this
parcel,
at
least
according
to
the
record
below.
and
the
state
would
remain
free
at
a
minimum
to
proceed
with
the
development
by
simply
entering
into
long-term
leases
instead
of
the
sale
of
these
parcels
of
land.
indeed,
there
appears
to
be
some
suggestion
that
that
is
what
the
state
would
do
in
the
event
that
this
court
does
not
vacate
the
injunction.
and
so
--
and,
indeed,
in
the
state
of
hawaii
it
is
not
uncommon
for
land
to
be
transferred
by
means
of
such
long-term
leases.
so
it
isn't
as
if
the
state
would
be
barred
from
engaging
in
any
development
whatsoever.
the
terms
of
the
injunction
simply
prohibit
the
sale
of
these
lands.
and,
again,
the
state
executive
has
been
operating
under
an
effective
moratorium
on
the
sale
of
ceded
lands
of
its
own
volition
during
the
pendency
of
this
litigation,
which
suggests
at
a
minimum,
regardless
of
the
jurisdictional
implications,
that
there
is
no
great
burden
on
the
state
from
this
injunction,
which,
again,
by
its
terms
lasts
only
as
long
as
the
state
legislature
acts.
and
i
would
add
one
additional
point
on
that
score,
which
is
that
to
the
extent
that
we
believe
that
the
hawaii
supreme
court's
decision
rested
on
a
fiduciary
duty
under
state
law,
the
state
would,
of
course,
be
free
to
amend
its
constitution
in
order
to
make
clear
that
the
state's
fiduciary
duty
to
native
hawaiians
does
not
run
to
the
extent
of
requiring
this
injunction.
but
this
--
there
has
been
no
effort
to
do
that,
and
i
would
submit
that,
as
a
political
matter,
it
would
be
highly
unlikely.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
the
governor's
statements
about
the
lack
of
an
intention
to
sell
ceded
lands
were
only
made
literally
in
the
days
before
we
filed
our
brief.
we
do
refer
to
them
in
a
footnote
in
our
merits
brief,
and
i
think
that
that
would
be
sufficient
to
preserve
the
issue--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
would
submit
that
even
if
the
court
does
not
believe
that
this
rises
to
the
level
of
jurisdictional
import,
that
it
is
at
least
significant
in
assessing
the
--
the
substantiality
of
the
burden
on
the
state.
that
the
state
through
its
highest
representative
appears
to
be
suggesting
that
the
state
has
no
present
need
to
alienate
any
of
these
lands.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
think
the
most
recent
figures
from
the
2000
census
are
that
there
are
something
like
1.2
million
people
in
the
state
of
hawaii.
and
of
that
number
something
like
240,000
identify
themselves
as
native
hawaiians
in
the
way
that
that
phrase
is
currently
defined
under
state
law.
thank
you.
