mr.
william
m.
jay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
three
binding
federal
laws
make
clear
that
the
state
of
hawaii
has
absolute
fee
title
to
the
lands
in
the
federal
trust.
it
also
has
the
power
to
sell
those
lands
for
the
purposes
congress
set
out
in
the
trust
instrument.
mr.
william
m.
jay
we
think
that
they
have
been
in
the
case
from
the
beginning.
they're
--
they
were
clearly
pressed
in
the
state
supreme
court.
and
we
think
they
are
fairly
encompassed
in
the
question
presented
partly
because,
as
general
bennett
said,
the
--
the
question's
reference
to
the
state's
sovereign
authority,
which
necessarily
includes
consideration
of
the
act
which
made
hawaii
a
sovereign
state,
the
admissions
act,
is
--
is
a
necessary
antecedent
to
resolution
of
that
question.
but
also
because
the
admission
--
the
apology
resolution,
itself,
in
the
preamble
on
which
the
respondents
rely
extensively,
goes
into
great
detail
about
the
newlands
resolution
and
the
cession
of
absolute
fee
and
ownership
by
the
republic
of
hawaii
to
the
united
states.
mr.
william
m.
jay
let
me
answer
that
in
two
steps,
justice
alito.
the
first
step
is
that
the
state
supreme
court's
permanent
injunction,
although
respondents
are
now
saying
that
the
claims
on
which
--
the
unrelinquished
claims
on
which
it
is
based
are
moral
in
nature
--
the
permanent
injunction
is
a
legal
obligation
and
enforceable
by
contempt.
and
so
the
state
--
the
state
supreme
court,
by
effectively
locking
up
the
lands
for
an
indeterminate
period
of
time,
has
treated
them
as
--
as
legally
valid
and
has
entered
relief
that
is
legal
in
nature.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
justice--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
justice
scalia,
that
gets
to
the
second
half
of
my
answer
to
justice
alito
as
well,
which
is
that
the
state
supreme
court
is
not
free,
as
a
matter
of
state
trust
law
or
otherwise,
to
formulate
obligations
that
don't
relate
to
the
state's
obligation
as
trustee
of
the
federal
trust--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens,
because
that
state
law
has
to
comply
with
the
limitations
set
out
in
section
5(f)
of
the
admissions
act.
to
be
sure,
the
political
branches
operating
as
trustee
of
the
trust
have
broad
discretion
to
allocate
lands
within
and
among
the
five
purposes
set
out
in
section
5(f).
but
what
the
--
what
the
state
can't
do
and
what
in
particular
the
state
courts
can't
do
in
the
name
of
formulating
state
trust
law
is
to
rely
on
considerations
that
are
altogether
outside
the
trust.
and
in
this
case,
any
consideration
of
the
unrelinquished
claims
of
the
native
hawaiians
would
not
--
would
not
be
based
on
their
status
as
one
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
trust,
but
on
their--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--i'm
saying
that
the
--
no,
justice
stevens.
the
--
the
state
court
can't
rely,
nor,
i
think,
could
the
state
legislature--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--the
legislature
could
determine
that
the
wisest
use
of
the
lands
today,
the
way
that
would
best
further
--
promote
the
welfare
of
native
hawaiians
today
would
be
not
to
sell
it.
the
legislature
certainly
could
do
that,
and
it
could
enact
a
moratorium
that
was
consistent
with
that
view.
but
what
it
can't
do
is
treat
it
--
and
this
is
the
question
justice
scalia
asked
at
the
end
of
general
bennett's
presentation
--
what
the
state
is
not
free
to
do
is,
based
on
the
claims
by
native
hawaiians,
not
as
beneficiaries
of
the
section
5(f)
trust,
but
based
on
considerations
that
arose
before
the
admissions
act
was
ever
enacted,
based
on
--
based
on
their
status
as
competing
claimants
to
the
title
of
the
land,
give
them
an
equitable,
moral,
or
otherwise
claim
to
lock
up
the
use
of
the
land.
the
--
the
theory
that
the
respondents
advanced
in
the
state
supreme
court
under
the
name
of
trust
law
is
that
a
trustee
may
not,
in
furtherance
of
a
trust,
engage
in
an
illegal
act.
and
that's
on
joint
appendix
141a
to
143a
and
other
places
in
the
record.
and
the
illegal
act
that
they
contemplate
is
the
continued
ownership
of
the
lands
by
the
state
of
hawaii.
so,
the
state
cannot,
in
--
in
ostensible
furtherance
of
the
federal
trust,
rely
on
state
law
principles
that
presume
the
illegality
of
the
federal
trust
or
the
illegality--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
justice
stevens,
the
state
--
the
state
is
given
authority
to
act
for
particular
purposes.
and
so,
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
--
for
which
the
state
acts
is
necessarily
relevant.
the
state
can't
act
for
a
purpose
that
is
not--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--it's
a
state--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--well,
i
think,
justice
alito,
that
if
the
state
made
that
determination
with
respect
to
the
class
of
native
hawaiians
who
are
defined
in
the
admission
act
as
--
as
one
of
the
present-day
beneficiaries
of
the
trust,
and
determined
that
it
was
--
that
that
was
the
best
way
to
act
for
the
betterment
of
native
hawaiians,
which
is
a
permissible
trust
purpose,
that
that
would
be
permissible.
but
for
the
state
to
--
to
act
on
considerations
that
are
wholly
extrinsic
to
the
trust,
to
treat
the
native
--
the
claims
of
native
hawaiians
as
valid,
even
though
they
are
--
and
to
assume
a
duty
to
the
native
hawaiians
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
state's
obligations
as
trustee
of
the
section
5(f)
trust,
we
think
that
would
be
impermissible.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
the
court
said,
justice
souter,
that
there
is
a
fiduciary
obligation
not
to
make
these
land
transfers
at
any
time
until
this
indeterminate
point
in
the
future
at
which
reconciliation
is
achieved.
but
to
say
--
to
say
that
that
--
that
they
are
not
thereby
pronouncing
on
the
validity
of
the
title
--
i
think
that's
inconsistent
with
the
newlands
resolution.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
i
wholly
agree,
justice
souter,
that
the
state
supreme
court
thought
the
apology
resolution
had
significance
and
that
the
apology
resolution--
mr.
william
m.
jay
--dictated
the
injunction.
mr.
william
m.
jay
well,
i
certainly
agree,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
state
supreme
court
thought
the
apology
resolution
dictated
the
entry
of
the
injunction,
and
the
--
also
on
page
85a,
the
state
supreme
court
says
that
the
apology
resolution
gives
rise
to
the
--
to
a
fiduciary
duty
to
native
hawaiians.
and
it
is
--
it
is
that
principle
that
the
state
supreme
court
was
able
to
find
a
fiduciary
duty
and
impose
it
on
the
state's
trusteeship
obligation,
even
though
that
--
that
fiduciary
duty
arises
outside
the
section
5(f)
trust.
and
that
is
why
we
think
that
the
scope
of
the
state
--
of
the
state's
obligation
as
trustee
is
within
the
court's
review
at
this
stage.
mr.
william
m.
jay
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
