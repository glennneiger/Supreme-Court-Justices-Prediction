chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
07-1372,
hawaii
v.
the
office
of
hawaiian
affairs.
general
bennett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
jay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
think
on
the
question-presented
issue?
are
all
of
the
federal
laws
on
which
the
hawaii
supreme
court
relied
to
say
there
was
a
cloud
on
the
title
before
the
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
jay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
shanmugam.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
they
relied
on
federal
law
to
create
a
fiduciary
obligation.
so
if
we
think
that
federal
law
did
not
create
a
fiduciary
obligation,
what
should
we
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
federal
law?
in
other
words,
not
simply
the
apology
resolution
but
the
other
federal
provisions?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
those
--
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
you
would
--
you
would
object
to
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
about
the
newlands
resolution,
the
admission
act,
and
the
organic
law?
do
you
acknowledge
that
if
the
hawaii
supreme
court
relied
on
those,
that
also
would
be
inappropriate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
relied
on
them
the
same
way
you
say
they
relied
on
the
apology
resolution,
to
give
rise
to
a
fiduciary
duty
under
state
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
would
have
no
--
just
to
carry
on
the
opinion-drafting
process,
you
would
have
no
objection
to
an
opinion
that
said
no
source
of
federal
law
gave
rise
to
a
duty
under
state
law,
fiduciary
or
otherwise;
that
any
further
proceedings
on
remand
should
be
based
solely
on
state
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
it's
not
simply
a
question
of
the
source
of
the
fiduciary
duty.
it
--
presumably,
in
the
course
of
saying
what
the
apology
resolution,
the
newlands
act,
the
organic
act,
and
the
admission
act
had
to
say,
we
may
well
say
something
to
the
effect
that,
because
it
conveyed
perfect
title,
it's
inconsistent
with
the
cloud
of
that
title,
under
a
fiduciary
obligation
created
by
state
law
or
anything
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
we
told
them
that
these
various
federal
resolutions,
including
the
apology
resolution,
conveyed
title
to
the
state
in
a
particular
way
that
precluded
the
burdening
of
the
state's
title
on
the
basis
of
federal
law,
then
they
would
have
to
find
a
basis
under
state
law
that
was
not
inconsistent
with
the
federal
law's
conveying
of
perfect
title.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
then
it
would
also
have
to
just
--
the
opinion
we're
drafting
would
go
further,
i
suppose,
and
since
we
are
interpreting
all
these
federal
provisions,
it
may
not
be
sufficient
to
say
that
it
did
not
create
this
obligation
and
the
hawaiian
supreme
court
was
wrong
to
do
that,
but
that
it
precluded
the
creation
under
state
law
of
this
type
of
obligation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
the
hawaiian
supreme
court
wants
to
create,
under
state
law,
a
particular
type
of
fiduciary
obligation
grounded
on
the
status
of
the
land
prior
to
admission,
then
it
has
to
run
--
under
the
supremacy
clause,
it
has
to
be
consistent
with
the
federal
provisions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
saying
they
did.
that's
the
first
question.
i'm
not
saying
they
grounded
it
on
federal
law;
i'm
saying
we
would
have
to
determine
whether
federal
law
precluded
the
grounding
of
a
fiduciary
duty
under
the
status
of
the
land
prior
to
admission.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
decision
of
the
hawaii
supreme
court
would
then
be
vacated?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
munsingwear.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--mr.
shanmugam,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
do
you
know
what
percentage
of
the
hawaiian
population
is
comprised
of
native
hawaiians?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
bennett,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-1372,
hawaii
versus
office
of
hawaiian
affairs.
