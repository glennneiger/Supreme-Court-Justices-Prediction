mr.
mark
j.
bennett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
1993
congressional
apology
resolution
did
not
alter
hawaii's
right
to
transfer
its
public
lands
or
repeal,
by
implication,
prior
congressional
enactments
that
had
extinguished
all
competing
claims
to
those
lands.
it
was,
as
its
sponsor
said
at
the
time,
a
simple
apology,
and
no
more.
the
lands
in
question
were
the
former
crown
and
government
lands
of
the
kingdom
of
hawaii.
the
republic
of
hawaii
was
the
successor
in
interest
in
ownership
to
those
lands
and
was
recognized
as
such
by
the
united
states.
the
1898
newlands
resolution
of
annexation
recited
that
the
republic
of
hawaii
was
ceding
the
absolute
fee
ownership
of
those
lands
to
the
united
states,
and
that
that
cession
was
accepted,
ratified,
and
confirmed.
once
the
united
states
congress
so
acted,
all
competing
claims
to
title
were
extinguished,
and
under
precedent
going
back
almost
200
years,
the
determinations
by
congress
to
accept
the
cession
were
final
and
conclusive
on
any
court.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
your
honor,
what
the
respondents
have
contended
from
day
one
of
this
case
is
that
they
have
a
property
right
in
this
--
in
the
land,
and
the
newlands
resolution
conclusively
settled
that
question.
there
is
no
property
interest
that
could
have
competed
with
the
united
states'
perfect
title.
that
perfect
title
was
passed
to
the
state
of
hawaii
in
1959
through
the
1959
hawaii
admission
act,
which--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--your
honor,
the
admission
act
gives
the
state
the
right
to
manage
and
dispose
of
the
lands
according
to
state
law.
so
the
political
branches
certainly
have
the
right
to
decide
which
lands
they
are
going
to
use
for
which
of
the
five
purposes--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--but,
your
honor,
in
this
case
what
respondents
urged
was
that
the
apology
resolution
changed
the
legal
landscape
and
commanded
the
state
to
hold
these
lands
possibly
in
perpetuity
without
alienation.
the
hawaii
supreme
court
specifically
found
that
the
apology
resolution
dictated
the
result
here,
that
plaintiffs
claims
did
not
even
arise
until
the
apology
resolution
was
signed
into
law
by
president
clinton.
in
addition,
the
plaintiffs
--
the
respondents
urged
upon
the
hawaii
supreme
court
a
property
right,
a
property
and
ownership
interest
in
these
lands.
even
if--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--your
honor,
that
certainly
is
one
question
before
the
court,
but
we
believe
fairly
included
in
that
question
is
the
issue
of
the
nature
of
the
state's
sovereign
authority.
the
question
presented
talks
about
whether
the
apology
resolution
changed
in
any
way
the
state's
sovereign
authority,
and
that
question
--
certainly
anterior
and
predicate
to
an
intelligent
resolution
of
that
question
is
the
nature
of
the
state
sovereign.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
because,
your
honor,
the
hawaii
supreme
court's
decision
also
rests
on
a
premise
foreclosed
by
federal
law,
that
is
that
there
are
competing
claims
to
title.
as
late
as
page
18
of
the
red
brief,
respondents
even
say
now
that
native
hawaiians
are
entitled
to
these
lands
as
a
matter
of
property
law,
but
they
do
not
say
anywhere
in
the
red
brief
how
that
property
law
claim
arises
or
how
that
property
law
claim
could
survive
the
newlands
resolution,
the
hawaii
organic
act,
or
the
admission
act.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
well,
your
honor,
the
hawaii
supreme
court,
at
page
69a
of
the
appendix
for
the
petition,
said
that
this
was
a
claim
seeking
an
injunction
--
injunctive
relief
with
regard
to
property
rights.
at
page
87a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
hawaii
supreme
court
said
there
are
questions
regarding
the
title
to
the
state's
ceded
lands.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
respondents'
attempt
to
trivialize
this
court's
jurisdiction
--
they
say,
for
example,
in
the
brief
in
opposition
that
even
if
this
court
were
to
reverse,
the
hawaii
supreme
court
will
simply
reinstate
the
exact
same
decision,
and
presumably
they
would
press
upon
the
court
the
exact
grounds
they've
pressed
for
14
years,
that
is--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--your
honor,
i
agree
that
this
decision
clearly
rests
on
federal
grounds,
but
we
would
also
suggest
that
the
question
presented
talks
about
whether
the
state's
sovereign
authority
is
stripped,
and
the
state's
sovereign
authority,
we
would
submit,
is
clear.
the
united
states
had
perfect
title.
the
state
of
hawaii
succeeded
to
the
united
states'
perfect
title.
respondents
do
not
suggest
anywhere
in
their
pleadings
why
that
is
not
so,
or
why
they
continue
to
press
even
with
this
court
this
property
right
claim
to
these
lands.
and
so
we
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
prudent
for
the
court
to
address
what
we
believe
is
the
fairly
included
question
of
the
nature
of
the
state's
sovereign
authority,
especially
as
it
would
appear
to
be
entirely
not
subject
to
contravention
by
the
respondents--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--well,
with
--
with
respect,
your
honor,
the
court
certainly
could
limit
its
ruling,
but
in
a
case
that
has
gone
on
for
14
years
and
which,
in
virtually
every
pleading,
the
respondents
have
filed
they
have
asserted
essentially
that
the
state
lacks
title
to
these
lands
because
the
united
states
lacked
title,
the
overthrow
of
the
kingdom
of
hawaii
was
illegal,
and
that
that's
the
precise
reason
for
14
years
the
state
has
either
been
through
an
injunction
or,
as
a
practical
matter,
not
been
able
to
alienate
its
lands,
that
this
court
certainly
has
the
ability
for
a
question
that
we
believe--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--well,
what's
left--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--your
honor,
certainly
under
the
terms
of
the
admission
act,
the
authority
given
the
political
branches
for
the
management
and
disposition
of
the
lands
is
broad
and
would
run
up
against
only
the
federal
common
law
of
trust
that
the
ninth
circuit
says
governs--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--well,
your
honor,
the
hawaii
supreme
court
did
say
that
this
is
an
injunction
based
on
property
rights.
the
hawaii
supreme
court
did
say--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--well,
your
honor,
at
page
85a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
court
said
that
the
congress
recognized
that
native
hawaiians
had
unrelinquished
claims
to
the
ceded
lands,
and
as
a
result
of
that
recognition,
the
apology
resolution
dictated
the
entry
of
this
injunction.
we
believe
that
clearly
that's
not
so,
but
that
this
idea
of
unrelinquished
claims
is
an
unrelinquished
property
right
claim.
this
is
what
was
urged
upon
the
hawaii
supreme
court
at
every
stage.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
your
honor,
what
our
response
would
be
is
a
simple
one:
that
the
issue
of
the
state's
title
would
in
our
view
be
undisputed.
the
united
states'
title
was
perfect
and
indisputable.
the
state's
title
is
perfect
and
indisputable.
and
this
court
has
said
that
one
of
the
functions
in
--
in
cases
where
respondents
claim
an
adequate
and
independent
state-law
ground
is
to
remand
the
case
by
disabusing
the
state
court
of
incorrect
notions
of
what
federal
law
either
permits
or
requires.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
yes,
your
honor,
and
they
have
not
asked
this
court
to
affirm.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
your
honor,
because
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
both
the
respondents
and
the
hawaii
supreme
court
believe
that
there
are
property
right
claims
that
native
hawaiians
have,
we
believe
those
property
right
claims
are
clearly
inconsistent
with
federal
law,
the
newlands
resolution,
and
the
admission
act,
and
that
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
not
to
reach
such
a
clear
claim.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
the
--
the
only
thing
is
the
position
of
the
respondents,
who
assert--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--well,
your
honor,
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
apology
resolution
does
not,
as
respondents
state,
recognize
the
validity
of
any
claims,
but
federal
law
forecloses
the
validity
of
any
claims.
and
we
believe
that
that
is
a
question
that
is
fairly
included
anterior
to
the
question
of
whether
the
resolution
stripped
hawaii
of
its
sovereign
authority.
it
is
only
natural
for
the
court
to
declare
what
we
believe
is
the
indisputable
proposition
that
hawaii's
sovereign
authority
is
based
on--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--your
honor,
the
--
the
legislature
has
wide
discretion
in
managing
and
disposing
of
the
assets
of
the
state.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
that
would
not
violate
the
admission
act,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
that
would
not.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
your
honor--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--your
honor,
if
the--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--if
the
legislature
believed
that
it
bettered
the
condition
of
native
hawaiians
to
provide
proceeds
from
land
to
the
native
hawaiians,
the
admission
act
gives
them
that
ability
to
do
it.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
yes.
i'd
--
i'd
like
to--
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
--i
think
that
would
be
contrary
to
federal
law,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
your
honor,
if
i
--
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
j.
bennett
thank
you,
your
honor.
it
is
undisputed
that
respondents
asserted
a
property-interest
claim;
that
any
property-interest
claim
is
in
flat
contradiction
with
federal
law;
that
the
state
has
perfect
title
to
these
lands;
and
that
there
is
no
possible
reason
why
this
court
should
not
disabuse
the
state
court
of
the
incorrect
notion
that
the
state
lacks
perfect
title.
on
the
mootness
issue,
the
asarco
versus
kadish
case
makes
clear
that
the
injunction
that
has
been
entered
is
a
present
injury.
but,
in
addition,
the
governor,
who
does
not
control
all
of
the
state
lands
--
there
are
a
variety
of
independent
agencies
that
do
--
talked
about
sale
but
not
transfer
or
exchange,
which
are
other
things
that
are
forbidden
by
this
court's
--
the
state
court's
--
injunction.
but
asarco
clearly
sets
out
that
we
have
an
injury.
but,
again,
what
--
the
basis
of
the
state
court's
decision
is
a
property
right
interest.
it
is
now
undisputed
by
counsel
that
such
a
property
right
interest
is
absolutely
inconsistent
with
federal
law,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
in
this
14-year-old
litigation
this
court
should
not
make
clear
the
simple
and
undisputed
fact
that,
pursuant
to
the
newlands
resolution,
the
organic
act,
and
the
admission
act,
that
the
state
has
perfect
title.
