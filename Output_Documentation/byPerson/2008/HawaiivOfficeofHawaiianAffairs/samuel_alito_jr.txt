if
the
apology
resolution
is
put
aside,
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
is
left,
other
than
state-law
issues.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
could
--
would
there
be
anything
to
prevent
the
hawaiian
legislature
from
passing
a
law
that
says,
we
have
absolute
--
we
have
title
to
these
lands,
but
we
are
going
to
impose
a
five-year
moratorium
on
any
transfer
of
the
lands
because
we
want
to
promote
a
reconciliation
process?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
a
point
on
which
both
you
and
your
adversaries
seem
to
agree
is
that
the
apology
resolution
really
is
not
critical
to
the
decision
of
the
hawaii
supreme
court.
because
if
you
thought
that
simply
taking
the
apology
resolution
off
the
books
would
provide
an
acceptable
outcome
from
your
point
of
view,
you
would
be
happy
with
our
deciding
just
that
narrow
question.
and
your
opponent
explicitly
says
that
the
apology
resolution
wasn't
critical
to
the
decision
of
the
hawaii
supreme
court.
isn't
that
true?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
isn't
it
true
that
you
don't
think
that
just
saying
the
apology
resolution
did
not
change
anything
would
be
insufficient?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
see
what
those
--
where
those
laws
get
us.
the
--
the
argument
that
is
made
on
the
other
side
is
that
the
native
hawaiians
have
a
moral
claim
to
these
lands,
not
that
they
have
a
property
right
claim
to
the
land.
and
if
the
state
of
hawaii,
acting
through
any
branch
of
its
government
--
and
that's
not
a
matter
of
concern
to
us
--
says
they
have
a
moral
claim
to
the
land
and,
therefore,
there
should
not
be
any
land
transfers
for
some
period
of
time,
what's
inconsistent
with
federal
law
in
their
doing
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
it's
the
state's
position--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
it's
--
it
is
imposing
a
moratorium
on
land
transfers
because
it
thinks
this
is
the
best
way
to
promote
the
interests
of
the
native
hawaiians,
and
part
of
their
thinking
is
that
there
was
an
inequity
done
when
absolute
title
was
transferred
to
the
united
states
and
then
to
the
state
of
hawaii?
would
that
be
a
violation
of
federal
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
after
the
overthrow
of
the
hawaiian
monarchy
in
1893.
the
united
states
annexed
hawaii
as
a
territory
and
years
later,
admitted
it
to
the
union
as
the
58th
state.
in
1993,
congress
passed
an
apology
resolution
which
apologized
to
the
native
hawaiians
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
for
the
overthrow
of
hawaiian
monarchy.
after
the
enactment
of
the
apology
resolution,
respondent
office
of
hawaiian
affairs
filed
this
lawsuit
in
the
hawaii
state
court.
respondent
claimed
that
the
apology
resolution
constituted
a
congressional
recognition
of
unrelinquished
land
claims
held
by
native
hawaiians
against
the
state
of
hawaii.
respondent
therefore
sought
an
injunction
to
prevent
the
state
from
selling
its
sovereign
lands
pending
resolution
of
those
unrelinquished
claims.
the
state
trial
court
denied
respondents'
request
for
relief
but
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
reversed.
relying
on
the
apology
resolution,
the
state
supreme
court
agreed
with
respondent
and
barred
the
state
from
selling
certain
of
its
lands.
we
conclude
that
the
apology
resolution
did
not
purport
to
have
legal
effect.
indeed,
the
resolution
would
create
serious
constitutional
concerns
if
it
had
attempted
to
cloud
hawaii's
title
to
its
sovereign
lands
more
than
three
decades
after
the
state's
admission
to
the
union.
for
this
and
other
reasons
set
out
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
