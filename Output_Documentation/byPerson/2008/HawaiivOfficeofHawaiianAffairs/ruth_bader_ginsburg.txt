justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
general
bennett,
if
i
understand
correctly,
looking
to
your
question
presented,
the
only
thing
before
us
is
the
effect
of
the
apology
resolution.
the
question
presented
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
admissions
act
or
the
newlands
resolution.
so
shouldn't
we
just
stick
to
the
question
as
you
presented
it?
whatever
the
picture
is,
does
the
apology
resolution
have
any
substantive
effect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it
necessary?
why
isn't
it
sufficient
just
to
say
that
this
resolution
has
no
substantive
effect,
period,
and
then
remand
to
the
hawaii
supreme
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
--
there
may
well
be,
but
then
the
hawaii
supreme
court
chose
its
grounds,
and
it
said
at
one
point
the
resolution
dictates
the
preservation
of
the
ceded
lands.
at
another
place
it
said
that
federal
law
provides
the
basis
for
its
decision
and
that
state
trust
law
is
interwoven
with
that
federal
law.
it
also
said
that
federal
law
grounds
the
decision
and
provides
the
governing
legal
standard.
now,
they
could
not
have
been
clearer.
they
repeated
at
least
five
times
that
their
decision
rested
on
the
resolution,
that
everything
turned
on
that
resolution
having
substantive
effect.
that's
why
they
said
their
decision
was
driven
by
federal
law.
and
i
don't
know
why
we
shouldn't
take
the
hawaii
supreme
court
at
its
word
repeated
so
many
times.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
don't
--
we
don't
know
that
for
sure.
it
may
well
be,
but
there
is
a
large
--
large
difference,
and
if
they're
relying
on
the
federal
ground
that
insulates
them
from
any
check
by
the
hawaii
polity,
but
if
they
are
forced
to
rely
on
state
law,
then
it's
up
to
the
people
of
hawaii
whether
they
like
it
or
not.
they
could
change
the
state
statutory
law,
equitable
notions,
constitutional
law.
but
by
doing
what
the
hawaii
supreme
court
did,
they
have
taken
the
case
out
of
the
realm
of
state
law,
subject
to
the
political
check,
put
it
on
federal
grounds.
so
i
think
that
that's
what
--
the
issue
properly
before
this
court,
and
not
anything
about
the
interpretation
of
the
admissions
act,
which
--
if
it's
implicit
in
your
question,
it's
a
little
hard
to
see.
ordinarily,
if
a
party
wants
us
to
address
the
effect
of
a
piece
of
legislation,
they
will
mention
that
in
the
question
presented.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
legislature,
if
it
wanted
to
--
as
i
understand
the
admission
act,
it
lists
five
purposes;
it
says
any
one
purpose.
and
the
legislature,
if
it
so
chose,
could
say,
we
want
this
property
--
the
proceeds
from
this
property
to
be
for
the
exclusive
betterment
of
the
conditions
of
the
native
hawaiians.
they
could
--
it
would
be
up
to
the
legislature
to
give
it
all
to
the
native
hawaiians,
wouldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
more
than--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--more
than
significance.
i
am
reading
the
sentence
that
immediately
follows
the
one
that
general
bennett
brought
to
our
attention
on
page
85a.
it
says,
"accordingly,
the
apology
resolution
dictates
that
the
ceded
lands
should
be
preserved
pending
a
reconciliation
between
the
united
states
and
the
native
hawaiian
people.
"
it
is
very
clear
language
--
"dictates".
and
that's
why
i
am
really
puzzled
how
this
court
has
any
business
wading
into
any
other
question
other
than
telling
the
hawaii
supreme
court
either
their
right
about
what
the
resolution
dictates
or
they
are
wrong,
and
that
they
are
wrong
because
it's
a
nice
apology,
but
it's
without
substantive
effect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
how
to
you
explain
the
language,
just
over
and
over
again
--
i
won't
repeat
it
--
but
they
said
this
resolution
of
ours
is
dictated
by,
compelled
by,
the
apology
resolution?
without
the
apology
resolution,
it
would
be
an
entirely
different
case.
and
now
you
seem
to
be
taking
what
the
hawaii
supreme
court
put
as
the
necessary
link,
the
apology
resolution
--
before
that
this
would
have
been
impossible
--
and
you
are
treating
it
now
as
sort
of
window
dressing,
icing
on
the
cake,
really
didn't
matter.
but
we
would
disrespect
the
hawaii
supreme
court
if
we
didn't
take
them
at
their
word
and
say
--
using
words
such
as
"dictated",
"compelled".
you
--
you
are
treating
this
as
sort
of
just
part
of
the
atmosphere.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
you
relied
on--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it's
not
what
the
hawaii
supreme
court
relied
on,
and
i
would
repeat
the
point
i
made
in
the
prior
argument:
what's
worrisome
about
this
is
they
are
fastening
on
a
piece
of
federal
legislation
and
say,
we
are
compelled
to
do
this
because
of
federal
law.
what
that
does
is
it
removes
it
from
the
hawaii
political
process.
if
they
left
federal
law
out
of
it,
and
they
said
truly
this
decision
rests
on
state
law,
we
think
that
the
title
belongs
with
the
native
hawaiians,
then
they
have
to
answer
to
the
polity.
and
here
the
hawaii
supreme
court
insulates
themselves
by
using
the
federal
law
as
a
crutch.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
--
if
you
took
federal
law,
the
apology
resolution,
out
of
the
picture,
the
hawaii
supreme
court
could
reach
the
result
that
it
reached,
and
then
we
might
have
questions
about
its
consistency
with
the
admissions
act
and
the
newlands
resolution.
but,
as
justice
breyer
said,
if
we
disabuse
them
of
the
notion
that
there
is
any
federal
compulsion
here,
then
the
rest
is
to
be
sorted
out.
we
wouldn't
have
to
say
that
they
have
a
good
claim
under
state
law,
just
not
address
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
political
process
question
i
think
is
really
bothersome,
that
the
hawaii
supreme
court
chose
to
use
this
federal
crutch.
it
seems
a
very
weak
reed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
do
you
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you
think
that
that
resolution
is
distinguishable
in
any
way
from
the
apology
that
the
united
states
made
to
the
people
of
japanese
ancestry
who
were
interned
after
world
war
ii?
the
united
states
did
say
--
what
was
--
i
think
it
was
an
executive
order
by
president
ford,
but
it
was
in
no
uncertain
terms,
stated
that
the
united
states
made
a
dreadful
error,
there
was
never
basis
for
rounding
those
people
up
and
putting
them
in
interment
camps.
did
--
is
there
any
difference?
and
that,
as
i
understand
it,
had
no
substantive
effect
until
congress
passed
legislation
providing
for
compensation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
native
hawaiians--
--the
native
hawaiians
--
they
do
get
20
percent
of
the
proceeds,
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
--
that
comes
out
of
hawaii
legislation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
--
the
$5.5
million
figure,
is
that
the
subject
of
litigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
i
go
back
to
your
--
your
suggestion
that
this
is
a
moot
case
because
the
government
--
because
the
--
the
governor
agrees
with
your
position.
but
wasn't
a
lot
of
money
already
sunk
into
developing
this
area
of
maui
for
desperately
needed
housing?
