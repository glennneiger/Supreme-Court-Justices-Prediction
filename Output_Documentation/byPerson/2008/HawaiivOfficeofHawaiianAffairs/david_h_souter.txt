justice
david
h.
souter
general,
the
difficulty
i
have
is
that
not
only
do
they
not
say
so,
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
didn't
say
so
either.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
would
be
well
advised
to
make
sure
that
we
understand
the
reasoning
of
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
before
we
start
talking
about
the
relationship
between
the
various
federal
statutes
and
whatever
this
claim
may
be.
i
simply
don't
understand
the
claim
myself.
i
do
understand
your
point,
because
i
think
this
much
is
clear
from
the
hawaiian
opinion:
that
they
think
the
apology
resolution
seriously
affects
the
claim.
that
we
can
deal
with,
but
once
we
get
out
of
that,
the
--
the
whole
case
seems
murky
to
me.
am
i
missing
something?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
what
the
hawaiian
supreme
court
said,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
98a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
concluding
portion
of
the
opinion.
"we
hold
that:
(1)
the
apology
resolution
and
related
state
legislation,
give
rise
to
the
state's
fiduciary
duty.
"
the
only
federal
statute
mentioned
is
the
apology
resolution,
and
the
rest
of
their
reasoning
seems
to
rest
upon
some
kind
of
state
equity
law
or
trust
law.
now,
that
trust
law
may
ultimately
be
inconsistent
with
prior
federal
acts,
but
the
only
--
the
only
thing
they
are
disclosing
right
now
is
--
aside
from
the
apology
resolution,
seems
to
be
state
trust
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
trust
law
is
based
on
somebody's
property
rights.
we
don't
know
whether
they
are
talking
about
legal
rights
or
equitable
rights,
and
that's
consistent
with
the
statement
i
just
read
to
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
general,
i
think
--
with
respect,
i
still
don't
know
what
the
position
of
the
hawaiian
supreme
court
is
going
to
be
if
this
court
rules
that
the
apology
resolution
does
not
support
the
proposition
that
you
just
read.
i
don't
know
whether
at
that
point
the
hawaiian
supreme
court
is
going
to
say,
okay,
all
we've
got
left
to
deal
with
now
is
state
trust
law,
or
whether
they've
got
to
pull
another
rabbit
out
of
the
hat
and
say,
but
there
is
--
there
is
some
kind
of
prior
--
there
is
some
kind
of
a
--
a
claim
against
which
prior
federal
law
could
not
prevail.
i
don't
know.
and
i
--
that's
--
that's
why
it
seems
to
me,
to
say
the
least,
imprudent
to
wade
into
it
at
this
point.
the
one
thing
we
know
that
seems
to
have
been
significant
to
their
decision
is
the
apology
resolution.
and
i
think
we
would
be
wise
to
stick
to
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
what
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
has
done.
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii,
in
effect,
has
said
the
land
is
tied
up
until
these
people
who
are
currently
negotiating,
the
state,
the
native
hawaiians
and
--
what
is
it,
the
united
church
of
christ,
all
come
to
a
--
in
effect,
a
resolution
and
a
reconciliation.
whatever
that
means,
it
does
not
sound
to
me
as
though
it
is
the
recognition
of
a
legal
title
claim
or
indeed
the
validity,
so
far
as
courts
are
concerned
with
validity,
of
any
claim
the
native
hawaiians
are
making.
they
are
just
saying,
no
more
land
transfers
until
these
people
sit
down
and
make
up
their
differences.
isn't
that
all
the
court
is
saying
at
this
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
--
isn't
the
fact
that
you
and
i
are
having
this
exchange
a
pretty
good
indication
that
we
don't
know
what
they
--
they
meant
exactly
by
that?
the
only
thing
that
we
can
be
sure
of
is
that
that
thought
the
apology
resolution
had
some
legal
significance.
they
said,
you
know,
it's
required
after
the
apology
resolution.
we
can
say
you
are
right
or
you
are
wrong,
and
i
think
we
know
what
--
what
we
are
talking
about.
but
to
go
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me,
that
we
are
wading
into
an
argument
that
you
and
i
can't
settle
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
shanmugam,
on
page
99,
the
state
supreme
court
is
saying,
inasmuch
as
the
apology
resolution
and
related
state
legislation
give
rise
to
a
fiduciary
duty.
they
are
saying
the
apology
resolution
did
so,
too,
not
only
state
law.
