mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
should
start
with
paragraph
69
of
the
complaint
because
i
think
petitioners'
treatment
of
paragraph
69
shows
why
they
have
no
coherent
theory
of
what
a
conclusory
allegation
is
and
what
it's
not.
because
what
does
paragraph
69
do?
it
sets
out
a
policy,
and
it
says
that
petitioners
approved
the
policy.
paragraph
96
does
exactly
the
same
thing.
paragraph
69
you
can
find
at
168
of
the
appendix;
paragraph
96
you
can
find
at
172
to
173.
in
both
--
in
both
cases
it
does
the
same
thing.
we
have
petitioners
approving
a
policy.
now,
petitioners
here
conceded
at
oral
argument,
contrary
to
their
reply
brief
but
consistent
with
their
opening
brief,
that
paragraph
69
states
a
factual
allegation.
so
if
paragraph
69
states
a
factual
allegation
that
is
entitled
to
be
considered
true,
then
paragraph
96
states
a
factual
allegation
that
is
entitled
to
be
considered
to
be
true.
this
isn't
--
this
case
is
not
about
ad
hoc
decisions
made
at
the
low
level
of
the
department
of
justice.
this
is
about
a
policy
approved
with
the
knowledge
of
petitioners
that
discriminated
against
detainees.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
well,
justice--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well,
paragraph
96
specifically
alleges
knowledge,
and
rule
9(b)
says
you
can
allege
knowledge
generally.
so
that
--
we
have
established
knowledge
of
the
policy.
the
policy
is
described
between
paragraphs
47
and
94
of
the
complaint.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
they
are
based
in
--
they
are
based
in
part
on
the
office
of
inspector
general's
report
about
what
happened
after
september
11th.
they
also
are
based
on
other
information
that
we
gathered
in
advance
of
filing
the
--
the
complaint.
but,
your
honors,
what
we
think
petitioners
are
asking
us
to
do
here--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--yes.
we
know
that
petitioners
ordered
a
--
ordered
to
have
certain
groups
targeted
for
questioning,
for
detention.
that's
all
in
--
some
of
that's
in
the
office
of
the
inspector
general's
report;
some
of
that
is
in
public
documents
referred
to
by
some
of
the
amicus
briefs.
we
think--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--oh,
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
mean,
the
office
of
the
inspector
general's
report
says
that
from
the
--
from
the
department
of
the
attorney
general
--
from
the
attorney
general's
office,
there
was
a
direction
to
make
the
conditions
of
confinement
as
harsh
as
possible.
that
was
--
that
was
directed
to
the
--
bop
director
sawyer.
it
said,
we
don't
want
them
to
be
able
to
get
access
to
johnny
cochran,
for
instance.
that
statement
was
made.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
well
--
and
certainly,
your
honor,
we
have
also
--
i
mean,
we
have
--
this
case
is
at
a
funny
posture,
right,
because
we
have
all
this
discovery
that
we
have
obtained
since
the
complaint
was
filed
which,
we
think,
confirms
the
allegations
in
this
complaint.
now,
we
think
petitioners'
position
would
require
us
to
allege
facts
at
the
complaint
stage
that
we
could
only
obtain
through
discovery.
but,
your
honors,
some
of--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well,
the
difference--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well,
but,
justice
scalia,
the
difference
between
this
case
and
bell
atlantic
is
exactly
what
justice
souter
alluded
to
in
his
colloquy
with
general
garre,
which
is
that
in
--
in
bell
atlantic
there
were
two
possible
--
there
were
two
possibilities.
a
reviewing
court
was
basically
left
in
equipoise,
looking
at
the
complaint
in
bell
atlantic.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
well,
your
honor,
we
have
two
different
theories,
right.
one
is
knowledge
of
and
approval
of,
and
the
other
is
direction.
but
those
--
both
of
those
possibilities
are
unlawful
possibilities.
the
question
is
who
is
responsible?
now,
bell
atlantic
doesn't
--
doesn't
prohibit
plaintiffs
from
pleading
cases
in
the
alternative.
and
if
you
are
going
to
plead
cases
in
the
alternative,
it's
possible,
of
course,
that
some
people
will
ultimately
be
held
responsible
and
some
won't.
but
the--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--certainly,
your
honor,
i
think
the
same
pleading
standards
apply.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
certainly,
your
honor,
i
think
the
same
pleading
standards
apply.
to
the
extent
petitioners
seek
protection,
the
protection
is
through
the
--
through
the
doctrine
of
qualified
immunity.
and
they
have
that
protection.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
well,
certainly--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--no
--
justice
breyer,
yes,
a
district
court
judge
can
do
that.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
in
fact,
the
second
circuit
directed
the
district
court
to
do
that
here.
i
mean,
petitioners
argue
as
if
discovery
is
impending
against
them.
in
fact,
the
second
circuit's
opinion
quite
clearly
says,
you
don't
get
discovery
against
petitioners
unless
you
get
discovery
from
lower
level
officials
that
confirm
the
need
to
have
discovery
from
petitioners.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
your
--
your
honor,
it
gives
them
quite
a
bit,
justice
scalia,
and
they
got--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well,
justice
scalia,
in
this
case
what
they
were
permitted
to
argue
was
that
the
law
was
not
clearly
established.
they
argued
that;
they
lost
that.
they
were
permitted
to
argue
that
they
were
--
they
acted
objectively
reasonably.
they
didn't
petition
for
cert
on
either
of
those
questions.
so
they
have
been
given
the
protections
afforded
by
qualified
immunity.
what
they
don't
get
because
of
qualified
immunity
is
extra
protections
not
described
in
the
rules,
not
approved
by
congress,
not
referred
to
by
this
court
in
any
--
in
any
way.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
your
honor
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
pleading
standard
isn't
different.
the
substantive
standard
of
liability
may
be
different,
and
that's
certainly
true.
i
mean,
one
has
to
allege
much
more
to
allege
a
claim
on--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
think
that
this
court
has
rejected
heightened
pleading
at
every
instance.
i
mean,
even
in
bell
atlantic,
this
court
rejected
heightened
pleading,
and
this
court
has
rejected
heightened
pleading
even
in--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
there's
no
reference
to
that
in
the
rules.
we
think
qualified
immunity
provides
the
protection
that
petitioners
are
seeking.
and
we
think
what
the
second
circuit
did
was
balance
a
very
difficult
--
difficult
principles
on
both
sides.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
bell
atlantic
to
argue
that
the
level
of
pleading
requires
--
depends
on
the
context
of
the
case,
but
that
the
substantive
liability
that
is
in
the
background
of
the
case
affects
what
you
have
to
plead.
and
what
petitioners
are
asking
is
to
take
the
substantive
background
of
an
affirmative
defense
and
make
that
affect
the
ability
--
what
you
have
to
plead,
not--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well,
what
this
court
--
justice
scalia,
what
this
court
said
in
bell
atlantic,
to
the
extent
it
disregarded
the
allegation
about
agreement
--
it
said
the
problem
with
the
agreement
was
that
it
didn't
allege
what,
it
didn't
allege
who,
it
didn't
allege
when.
and
i
don't
think
it
can
be
said
about
this
complaint.
this
alleges
who,
this
alleges
what
it
was,
this
alleges--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--when
it
occurred--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--in
the
weeks
after
september
11th.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
justice
scalia,
they
are
made
on
the
basis
of
the
information
that
we
garnered
from
the
office
of
inspector
general's
report.
what
we
know
--
what
we
know
about--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
is
our
--
our
contention,
your
honor,
because
it's
a
--
it's
an
allegation
about
a
policy.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
we
certainly
don't
think
it's
absurd
or
bizarre,
which
is
the
argument
that
the
petitioners
raised
below--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
i
think
it
is
a
problem
posed
by
that
interpretation
of
bell
atlantic.
i
don't
think
it's
a
problem
that's
posed
by
this
particular
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well,
justice
stevens--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--you
probably
wouldn't
say
he
did
it
personally,
and
there
might
be
a
respondeat
superior
theory
there,
for
liability,
that
we
don't
have
access
to
in
the
bivens
arena,
which
we
concede;
we
have
to
establish
a
link
between
the
unconstitutional
conduct
and
--
and
the
actions
of
the
petitioners.
so
that
may
be
how
it's
pleaded,
and
that
might
get
it
closer
if
there
were
--
certainly
if
there
were
a
policy
of
putting
mice
in
coke
bottles,
that
would
certainly
get
it
closer.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
it
--
i
--
i
don't
know
that
it
is
fanciful,
justice
stevens.
i
think--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--no,
certainly
not.
[laughter]
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
i
think
--
i
mean,
the
essential
point
in
this
case
is
that
the
second
circuit
was
faced
with
a
dilemma.
i
mean,
there's
a
liberal
pleading
standard
and
there's
qualified
immunity.
and
the
second
circuit
tried
to
resolve
it,
did
i
think
a
very
good
job
of
resolving
it
with
the
interests
--
all
of
the
interests
that
petitioners
are
concerned
about.
they
were--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well,
i
guess
i
want
to
distinguish
that
allegation
from
the
allegations
here.
we
are
not
alleging
that
the
petitioners
individually
identified
particular
detainees
as
of
interest
or
as
of
high
interest.
we
are
alleging
that
they
either
created
the
policy
or
they
knew
of
and
approved
of
it.
now
--
now,
we
could
talk
about
"knew
of
and
approved".
as
i
said,
under
rule
9(b),
9(b)
any
other
way,
and
petitioners
don't
suggest
that
we
do.
so
then
we
have
"approved".
now,
if
they
knew
it,
right,
if
we
accept
that
they
knew
about
this
policy,
and
we
also
accept
paragraph
69
as
petitioners
concede
we
must
accept
it
to
be
true,
then
we
know
that
they
knew
that
there
was
this
policy
occurring
and
they
approved
the
policy
of
not
releasing
them--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
and
i
think
i
was
--
i
was
trying
to
get
there,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
way
i
would
say
it
is
this:
we've
alleged
that
they
knew,
in
paragraph
96,
that
the
policy
was
discriminatory.
that's
clearly
alleged
in
paragraph
96.
we've
also
alleged
that
they
approved
the
policy.
the
link
--
to
the
extent
that
approval
is
not
sufficient
for
this
court,
the
link
between
approval
in
96
and
an
allegation
is
paragraph
69,
because
if
they
knew
that
these
individuals
were
being
detained
in
restrictive
conditions
of
confinement
because
of
their
race,
religion,
and
national
origin,
as
we
alleged
in
96,
and
they
also
approved
that
they
should
not
be
released
until
cleared,
then
they
are
approving
them
being
held
in
restrictive
conditions
of
confinement
based
upon
race,
religion,
and
national
origin.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
well,
justice
breyer,
if
those
are
the
facts,
then
those
are
facts
that
have
to
be
established
through
discovery.
they
cannot
be
established
at
the
pleading
stage.
i
would
think
we
could
all
agree
on
that.
and
that's
their
--
and
they
can
do
that
through
discovery.
now,
at
the
pleading
stage,
if
they
don't
want
to
file
an
answer
and
deny
the
facts,
they
can
move
to
dismiss
on
qualified-immunity
grounds
as
they
have.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
well,
the
second
circuit
gives
a
clear
path
for
defendants
in
that
situation,
justice
breyer,
and
the
answer
is,
if
you
want
to
make
a
rule
12(e)
motion,
make
it;
it
was
referred
to
in
crawford-el.
but,
more
importantly,
we
don't
get
discovery
of
them.
we
don't
get
to
drag
them
through
discovery
unless--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--that's
correct.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
well,
as
to
postponing
discovery,
that's
exactly
what
the
second
circuit
directed
the
district
court
to
do.
so
that's
been
done,
your
honor.
as
to
dismissing
them
and
re-filing
later,
the
problem
with
that
is
there
could
be
a
statute
of
limitations
problem,
and
that
--
so
that's
just
not
a
solution.
i
mean,
that's
--
that
was
a
solution
that
might
result
ultimately
in
absolute
immunity
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
it's
3
years
here,
your
honor.
and
so
we've
--
we've
obtained
discovery.
now,
if
it
had
been
--
if
this--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--certainly
not.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
certainly
not.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
in
fact,
it
has
been
formally
stayed,
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--and
the
second
circuit's
decision
confirms
that.
i
mean,
the--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well,
if
this
court--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well,
if
--
justice
alito,
if
this
court
in
affirming
the
second
circuit
outlines
and
says
the
second
circuit
took
the
proper
steps
--
this
is
what
the
district
court
should
do
--
then
if
any
district
court
disregards
that,
then
there
could
be
a
petition
for
mandamus.
and
that's
--
and
i
think
courts
of
appeals
would
respect
this
court's
opinion
if
this
court
said,
look,
here's
the
dilemma,
here's
the
best
way
to
resolve
it.
i
do
want
to
make
a
point
about
the
--
i
do
want
to
make
one
jurisdictional
point,
your
honor
--
your
honors,
and
that
is,
if
petitioners
had
raised
these
arguments
in
the
context
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim,
and
they
had
lost,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today,
right?
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction.
and
johnson
v.
jones,
i
think,
makes
clear
that
you
can't
bootstrap
jurisdiction
by
referring
to
qualified
immunity.
and,
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
petitioners'
notice
of
motion
to
dismiss,
point
1
is
dismiss
for
qualified
immunity;
point
2
is
dismiss
because
it
does
not
sufficiently
allege
personal
involvement.
that
is,
in
their
notice
of
motion
itself,
they
separated
out
these
two
issues.
now,
in
their
briefing
at
all
the
lower
courts
and
in
this
court,
they've
elided
them.
but
our
position
on
--
on
jurisdiction
is
that
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
appellate
jurisdiction
to
--
to
deal
with
this
question,
and
in
fact
petitioners'
own
motion
suggests
that
these
two
issues
are
separable
and
that
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
clearly
established
law
applied
and
the
objective
reasonableness
of
petitioners'
conduct.
and
that,
we
think,
is
another
way
of
resolving
the
case.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
well,
your
honor,
justice
souter,
i
do
think
that
in
this
way
the
oig
report
is
very
instructive.
it
basically
confirms
that
none
of
the
folks
who
were
held
as
of
interest
or
as
high
interest
were
ever
charged
or
suspected
of
being
involved
in
terrorism.
that
was
well
over
700
people.
as
for
paragraph
48--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--we
alleged
that
many
--
like
many
--
plaintiffs,
like
many
detainees,
were
held
for
no
reason.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
that's
what
we
alleged.
and
in
paragraph
48,
i
just
want
to
say
that
does
not
support
the
view
that
there
was
no
racial
criteria
here.
what
it
--
paragraph
48
is
immediately
followed
by
paragraph
49,
which
says
the
classifications
were
made
because
of
race.
paragraph
48
is
saying
the
distinction
between
"of
interest"
and
"of
high
interest"
was
totally
arbitrary.
but
that's
just
a
way
of
saying
that
this
was
a
racial
classification
policy.
it
was
a
racial
classification
policy
that
resulted
in
harsh
conditions
of
confinement
for
our
client
and
for
many
individuals.
and
now
we
have
alleged
petitioners'
connection
to
that.
you
know,
we
could
say--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
very
difficult
for
us
to
say
in
a
complaint
anything
other
than
no
--
no
legitimate
penological
interest,
because
we
couldn't
go
through
the
complaint
proving
all
the
negatives.
the
fact
is
our
client
posed
no
threat
that
connected
to
9/11.
we
alleged
that.
we
alleged
that's
true
of
multiple
detainees,
and
we
think
that's
sufficient
to
say
that
there
was
no
penological
interest.
now,
petitioner--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--oh--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
for
a
period
it's
constitutional
to
hold
them
solely
based
on
their
race,
religion,
and
national
origin.
and
if
it
is--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--well,
that
is
the
allegation.
if
it
is,
that's
an
issue
to
be
dealt
on
the
merits,
exactly
as
this
court
did
in
johnson
v.
california.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
well--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--justice
scalia,
that
is
the
allegation
in
the
complaint,
that
as
individuals
were
encountered--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--we
respectfully
disagree
with
--
about
that,
justice
scalia.
but
i
would
say
that
with--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--these
were
people--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--justice
ginsburg,
these
were
individuals
who
were
swept
up
either
in
the
immigration
detention
system
or
in
the
justice
criminal
detention
system,
and
that's
where
the
classification
was
made.
but
--
but
i
--
i
do--
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
correct.
we
don't
dispute
that.
but
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
johnson
v.
california
and
in
parents
involved
is
instructive,
because
there
the
court
says,
look,
if
there
is
a
racial
classification,
it
has
to
be
judged
under
strict
scrutiny.
and
even
in
johnson
v.
california,
where
the
court
said
the
state's
power
was
at
its
apex,
which
is
in
the
context
of
their
prisons,
and
even
where
there
is
an
argument
that
we
have
gang
violence
--
we
know
that
racial
identity
goes
to
gang
violence
to
some
extent
--
still
the
state
was
put
to
its
burden
of
proof
of
a
compelling
state
interest,
and
even
though
that
was
a
case
that
involved
damages,
it
was
a
qualified
immunity
case.
and
johnson
v.
california
is
in
many
respects
no
different
from
this
case.
yes,
the
9/11
context
makes
a
difference,
and
petitioners
were
able
to
rely
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
a.
reinert
the
petitioners
were
allowed
to
rely
on
the
9/11
context
in
making
their
argument
about
qualified
immunity,
about
the
objective
reasonableness
of
their
conduct,
and
about
whether
the
law
was
clearly
established.
but
that
does
not
mean
--
thank
you,
your
honor.
