justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
--
you
could
have
said
the
same
thing
about
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy
in
--
in
the
antitrust
case.
i
mean,
that
was
the
argument.
how
can
we
prove
an
agreement
until
we
have
discovery?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
say
you
need
something
more
in
order
to
go
forward,
something
more
than,
you
know,
you
prevented
these
people
from
talking
to
johnny
cochran.
that's
not
going
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
are
two
possibilities
here.
number
one
is
the
possibility
that
there
was
a
general
policy
adopted
by
the
high-level
officials
which
was
perfectly
valid
and
that
whatever
distortions
you
are
complaining
about
was
in
the
implementation
by
lower
level
officials.
that's
one
possibility.
the
other
possibility,
which
seems
to
me
much
less
plausible,
is
that
the
--
the
high-level
officials
themselves
directed
these
--
these
unconstitutional
and
unlawful
acts.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
that's
lovely,
that
--
that
the
--
the
ability
of
the
attorney
general
and
director
of
the
fbi
to
--
to
do
their
jobs
without
having
to
litigate
personal
liability
is
dependent
upon
the
discretionary
decision
of
a
single
district
judge.
i
mean,
i
thought
that
the
protection
of
qualified
immunity
gave
them
--
gave
them
more
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
give
them
much,
if
that's
all
it
gives
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
pleaded
a
conspiracy
--
they
pleaded
a
conspiracy
in
bell
atlantic.
it
wasn't
a
matter
of
not
--
not
setting
forth
in
the
complaint
the
substance
of
what
produced
liability.
they
pleaded
conspiracy.
justice
antonin
scalia
when?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
say
when?
does
it
say
what
basis?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
on
what
basis
any
of
these
allegations
against
the
high-level
officials
are
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we'll
--
we'll
check
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
solicitor
general
contests
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
--
is
no
penological
interest
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
is
that
the
only
basis
--
after
an
attack
on
the
country
of
the
magnitude
of
9/11,
is
that
the
only
basis
on
which
people
could
be
held?
namely
that
these
people
are
the
--
are
the
guilty
culprits,
and
we
are
going
to
put
them
in
jail?
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
for
at
least
a
period,
you
can
hold
people
just
--
just
to
investigate?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
wasn't
solely
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
net
was
surely
not
cast
wide
enough
if
anybody
with
that
race,
religion
was
--
was
swept
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
it's
solely
for
that
reason,
there
would
have
been
hundreds
of
thousands
of
others.
justice
antonin
scalia
--implausible.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
are
right,
you
win
assuming
you
get
a
district
judge
who
is
also
right.
