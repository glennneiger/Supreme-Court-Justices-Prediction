justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
two
questions
--
i
have
two
questions
that
might
be
related.
you
began
by
saying
that
you
had
two
points
for
us.
[laughter]
you
said
the
first
was
that
the
court
erred
in
saying
that
there
was
a
--
a
violation
had
been
alleged.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
wanted
to
reach
the
second,
and
i
was
wondering
if
the
second
would
address
this
sub-question
that
i
have.
if
we
were
to
say
that
twombly
is
to
be
confined
to
the
antitrust
and
commercial
context,
would
--
would
that
destroy
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
do
have
the
same
lingering
doubts
as
justice
--
or
concerns
or
questions
as
justice
breyer.
it's
hard
for
me
to
believe
we
had
to
wait
for
twombly
in
order
to
have
this,
and
it
seems
to
me
rule
11
is
not
applicable
here
because
it
simply
works
after
the
fact.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
requires
as
to
determine
if
a
complaint
is
sufficient
to
withstand
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
respondent
here,
javaid
iqbal,
was
the
plaintiff
in
the
district
court.
the
respondent
is
a
pakistani
and
a
muslim.
following
the
september
11
terrorists
attack,
respondent
was
arrested
on
criminal
charges
and
detained
by
federal
officials
in
a
maximum
security
facility.
after
pleading
guilty
to
the
charges
against
him
and
serving
a
term
of
imprisonment,
the
respondent
filed
a
bivens
action
against
numerous
federal
officials
including
the
two
petitioners
here,
john
ashcroft,
the
former
attorney
general,
and
robert
mueller,
the
director
of
the
fbi.
the
complaint
made
various
allegations
that
our
opinion
discusses
in
considerable
details,
but
the
thrust
of
the
complaint
is
that
petitioners
subjected
respondent
to
harsh
conditions
of
confinement
on
a
count
of
race,
religion
or
national
origin
in
violation
of
the
fifth
and
first
amendments.
the
complaint
alleges
that
ashcroft
was
the
principal
architect
of
the
unconstitutional
scheme
while
mueller
was
instrumental
in
its
adoption
and
execution.
the
petitioners
invoked
their
qualified
immunity
as
government
officials
and
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
failed
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
interlocutory
appeal.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed.
its
opinion
considered
our
recent
decision
in
bell
atlantic
corp.
versus
twombly.
it
concluded
that
twombly
creates
a
flexible
plausibility
standard
that
did
not
require
the
respondent
to
amplify
his
allegations
given
the
facts
he
did
allege
in
the
complaint.
we
grated
certiorari,
we
now
reverse.
before
addressing
the
merits
of
petitioners'
appeal,
we
first
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
review
the
district
court's
order
denying
petitioners'
motion
to
dismiss.
there
was
no
final
judgment
in
the
district
court.
but
for
the
reason
stated
in
the
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
trial
court's
ruling
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
turning
to
the
merits,
we
hold
that
respondent's
complaint
fails
to
plead
sufficient
acts
to
state
a
claim
for
unlawful
discrimination.
in
twombly,
we
considered
the
elements
of
plaintiff
must
plead
to
maintain
an
anti-trust
action
and
this
case
requires
us
to
determine
the
facts
of
plaintiff
must
show
in
a
bivens
action.
as
the
respondent
correctly
concedes
there
is
no
vicarious
or
imputed
liability
in
the
bivens
or
a
1983
action.
that
simply
means
that
each
individual
defendant's
liability
stand
or
falls
based
on
the
defendant's
own
conduct.
the
supervisor
can
be
held
to
account
for
his
or
her
own
misconduct,
but
as
it
is
conceded
that
there
is
no
vicarious
liability
here,
the
supervisor
cannot
be
held
liable
for
a
subordinate's
tortious
behavior.
the
term
supervisory
liability
and
a
context
of
a
bivens
or
1983
action
is
a
misnomer.
the
elements
necessary
to
demonstrate
a
constitutional
violation
will
vary
with
the
constitutional
provision
at
issue.
but
where
a
plaintiff
is
alleging
discrimination
in
contravention
of
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
are
precedents
established
that
purposeful
discrimination
is
required
to
impose
liability.
to
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss,
respondent's
complaint
must
show
the
petitioners'
purposefully
discriminated
against
him
on
the
basis
of
race,
religion
or
national
origin.
respondent's
complaint
comes
up
short.
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
8,
a
complaint
must
contain
a
short
and
plain
statement
of
the
claim
showing
that
the
pleader
is
entitled
to
relief.respondent's
pleading
does
not
comply
with
rule
8.
allegation
is
based
on
the
bold
assertion
that
petitioners
agreed
to
subject
to
respondent
to
harsh
conditions
solely
on
account
of
impermissible
factors
are
mere
legal
conclusions
that
are
not
entitled
to
be
assumed
true.
though
his
complaint
does
contain
the
well
pleaded
factual
allegation
that
petitioners
arrested
thousands
of
arab
muslim
men
in
the
wake
of
9/11,
except
in
that
fact
is
true
does
not
give
rise
to
a
plausible
entitlement
to
relief.
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
a
legitimate
constitutional
policy
directing
law
enforcement
to
arrest
and
detain
individuals
because
of
their
suspected
links
to
the
attacks
would
produce
a
disparate
impact
on
arab
muslims
even
though
petitioners'
purpose
was
not
to
target
arabs
or
muslims.
now,
it
is
important
to
note
that
we
express
no
opinion
concerning
a
sufficiency
of
respondent's
complaint
against
the
defendants
who
are
not
before
us
here.
respondent's
account
of
his
prison
ordeal
alleges
serious
official
misconduct
that
we
need
not
addressed
here.
our
decision
is
limited
to
the
determination
that
respondent's
complaint
does
not
entitle
him
to
relief
from
these
petitioners.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
to
determine
if
respondent
should
be
give
leave
to
amend
his
deficient.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined
and
justice
breyer

opinion.
