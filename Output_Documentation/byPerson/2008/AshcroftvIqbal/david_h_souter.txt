justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
garre,
isn't
there
more
involved
here
than
simply
derivative
liability
for
the
acts
of
others?
i
--
i've
got
a
bunch
of
excerpts
from
the
complaint,
but
let
me
just
go
to
one,
on
section
--
paragraph,
rather,
97.
that
charges
the
defendants
ashcroft
and
mueller
with
willfully
and
maliciously
designing
a
policy.
it
doesn't
sound
like
respondeat
superior.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
--
to
charge
them
directly
with
coming
up
with
what
these
people
are
complaining
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
don't
--
may
i
just
interrupt
you
there?
why
don't
you
think
the
reference
here
in
the
language
i
just
read,
to
designing
a
policy,
includes
the
policy
which
is
several
times
described
as
being
one
which
called
for
holding
--
for
arab
muslim
men
of
certain
countries
of
origin
without
reference
to
any
penal
purpose?
i
mean,
that
--
i
think
that
is
adequately
described
in
there
as
part
of
the
policy.
justice
david
h.
souter
even
--
even
if,
as
the
chief
justice
said,
they
knew
and
condoned
the
policy?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
may
be
--
you
--
i
mean,
you
may
be
right.
i
think
there's
--
there's
a
lot
of
tension
in
the
--
in
the
allegations
here.
i
--
i
grant
you
that.
but
isn't
the
proper
way
to
deal
with
those
tensions
at
this
stage
to
file
a
motion
for
a
more
definite
statement
and
find
out
for
sure?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
difference,
it
--
and
maybe
this
isn't
a
sufficient
difference.
but
the
difference
in
my
mind
between
this
and
bell
atlantic
was
that,
in
bell
atlantic
you
had
a
set
of
allegations
in
which
in
--
in
effect
it
was
an
either-or
choice.
there
were
two
possibilities
consistent
with
the
allegations
in
bell
atlantic.
one
was
a
conspiracy
possibility;
one
was
a
--
a
lawful
parallel
conduct
possibility.
and
there
just
wasn't
any
way
to
pick
one
as
being
a
more
probable
interpretation
of
what
they
were
getting
at.
here
the
problem
is
not
so
much
an
eitheror
choice
as
to
which
we
are
clueless,
but
a
just
vagueness
or
uncertainty.
does
the
--
does
the
talk
about
the
--
the
racial
criterion
go
to
the
policy
as
devised
or
the
policy
as
implemented?
and
so
on.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
here
we're
--
we're
in
a
kind
of
conceptually
a
squishier
situation
and
it
might
be
better
to
get
a
more
definite
statement
than
to
say,
well,
you
--
you've
got
to
make
a
choice,
and
there's
no
way
to
make
a
choice.
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
mr.
garre,
you
are
using
the
word
"plausible"
or
you're
taking
the
word
"plausible"
out
of
bell
atlantic,
i
think,
and
you
are
using
it
to
mean
something
that
probably
can
be
proven
to
be
true.
bell
atlantic
drew
that
distinction.
they
--
the
plausibility
there
is
a
plausibility
that
if
they
prove
what
they
say,
they
will
--
they
will
establish
a
violation.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
i
--
i
think
you
are
right
that
if
somebody
makes
just
a
totally
bizarre
allegation
that
nobody
in
the
world
could
take
seriously,
that
--
that
the
issue
can
be
raised.
but
in
justice
breyer's
case,
the
--
that
--
that
may
be
the
case
if
the
claim
is
that
the
president
of
coke
was
--
was
personally
putting
mouses
in
bottles.
but
the
claim,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
attorney
general
or
the
director
of
the
fbi
was
establishing
a
policy
of
no
release
until
cleared
or
a
policy
that
centered
on
people
with
the
same
characteristics
as
the
hijackers
does
not
have
that
kind
of
bizarre
character
to
it
and,
i
think,
would
not
run
afoul
of
the
--
of
the
plausibility
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
would
agree,
but
this
is
about
as
far
from
common
government
operation
as
one
can
get.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
know,
but
the
courts
can't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
courts
can't
ignore
the
extraordinary
circumstances,
either.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
reinert--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
want
to
throw
you
a
question.
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
softball
question.
you
can
----
[laughter]
you
can
let
me
know.
i
--
i'm
starting
with
the
assumption,
which
i
think
is
--
is
in
bell
atlantic,
that
what
we
are
concerned
with
in
context
is
that
the
--
the
context
tells
us
how
specific
you've
got
to
be
versus
how
conclusory
you've
got
to
be,
and
the
reason
it
does
so
is
that
some
allegations
are
--
are
more
likely
to
be
true
than
others
depending
on
the
context.
is
it
fair
to
say
--
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
is
it
fair
to
say
that
your
basic
pleading
here
rests
on
the
following
assumption:
that
it
is
more
plausible
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
the
director
of
the
fbi
were
in
fact
directly
involved
in
devising
a
policy
with
the
racial
characteristics
and
the
coercive
characteristics
that
you
claim,
than
that
the
president
of
coca
cola
was
putting
mouses
in
bottles?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
would
say,
if
--
to
the
coke
question
you
would
say,
yes,
they've
got
to
get
more
facts
there,
this
is
just
--
this
is
just
crazy
to
think
that
the
president
is
putting
mice
in
the
bottles.
but
you're
saying
that,
so
far
as
the
close
involvement
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
fbi
director,
it's
not
crazy
to
assume
what
you
--
what
you
say,
and,
therefore,
you
don't
have
to
get
into
more
detail
in
order
to
have
an
adequate
claim
here.
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
ask
you
this
question?
and
--
and
i
ask
it,
you
know,
mindful
of
what
you've
just
said,
but
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
the
two
issues
can
be
kept
as
--
as
separated
as
you
suggest.
another
avenue
to
responding
to
the
problem,
i
think,
that
justice
breyer's
last
hypo
raised
would
be
as
follows
--
and
then
i'll
tell
you
the
difficulty
that
i
have
with
it,
and
i
was
going
ask
you
to
comment
on
the
difficulty.
he
said
that
the
--
the
allegation
--
one
way
to
read
the
allegation,
and
i
think
a
fair
way,
is
to
say
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
the
fbi
devised
a
policy
and
condoned
the
implementation
of
a
policy
that
was
based
on
racial
and
religious
grounds
with
no
penological
purpose.
well,
under
the
circumstances
of
immediate
post-9/11,
it
is
not
surprising
necessarily
that
they
--
they
devised
a
policy
that
had
reference
to
religion
and
national
origin
and
so
on,
given
what
we
knew
about
the
hijackers.
what
is
not
so
easy
to
accept,
as
a
matter
of
adequate
pleading,
is
the
claim
that
there
was
no
penological
interest
involved
in
the
decision
of
how
to
and
how
long
to
hold
the
individuals
who
were
picked
up.
one
answer
to
that,
which
i
think
is
--
is
in
your
pleadings,
is
that
you
refer
to
specific
individuals
and
in
particular
to
your
own
client,
who
was
in
the
position
of
being
held
under
these
conditions
for
a
considerable
period
of
time,
and
it
turns
out
there's
--
there's
no
indication
that
there
was
ultimately
a
justified
penological
interest.
so
that
might
be
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question.
there's
enough
in
here
about
specific
detentions
to
make
it
plausible
for
pleading
standards
that
they
were
being
held
without
any
penological
interest.
the
difficulty
i
have
with
that
line
of
thinking
is
this:
you
also
allege
in
there
that
lower
level
officials
were
making
decisions
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
without
adequate
criteria
as
to
--
as
to
how
they
should
make
them.
and
that
particular
line
of
allegations
suggests
that
what
was
really
going
on
here,
including
what
was
happening
to
your
client,
wasn't
the
result
of
--
of
clear
policy
decisions
made
by
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
the
fbi,
but
they
--
they
were
just
being
scattered.
so,
what
in
the
context
of
your
whole
pleading
makes
it
adequate
simply
to
charge
on
a
conclusory
basis
that
these
two
defendants
were
devising
a
policy
that
had
--
that
was
intended
to
have
an
effect
of
no
penological
interest?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
--
you'll
have
to
help
me
out.
did
you
allege
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
that's
what
you're
saying--
justice
david
h.
souter
--are
you
--
are
you
saying
that
the
--
that
the
claim
that
there
was
no
penological
interest
for
certain
decisions
goes
simply
to
the
distinction
between
the
decision
whether
to
classify
as
"of
interest"
versus
as
"of
high
interest"?
