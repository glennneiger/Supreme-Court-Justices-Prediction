justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
general
garre
said
there's
no
question
that
there
was
a
policy,
and
that
it
was
known
by
and
approved
by
the
petitioners
here,
but
that
the
policy
is
different
from
the
policy
that
you
allege.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
that's
the
question.
where
--
what
do
you
think
is
the
most
specific
allegation
in
your
complaint
as
to
the
petitioners'
knowledge
and
approval
of
the
--
of
an
illegal
policy?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
as
to
paragraphs
96
and
97,
which
did
seem
to
be
the
most
specific,
are
those
based
on
any
specific
information
that
you
have
concerning
petitioners,
or
are
they
based
on
inferences
that
you
think
you
can
draw
from
your
allegations
about
what
happened
and
the
nature
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
petitioners?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
really
answered
my
question.
are
they
based
on
anything
specific
that
you
know
about
what
the
petitioners
did?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
they
weren't
"all"
completely
--
they
were
not--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
that
may
be
what
happened
here,
but
if
--
if
the
second
circuit
is
affirmed,
there
may
be
other
suits
that
are
like
this.
and
what
is
the
protection
of
the
high-level
official
with
qualified
immunity
with
respect
to
discovery
if
the
--
the
official
cannot
get
dismissal
under
qualified
immunity
at
the
12(b)(6)
stage?
how
many
district
judges
are
there
in
the
country?
over
600?
one
of
the
district
judges
has
a
very
aggressive
idea
about
what
the
discovery
should
be.
what's
the
protection
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
a
discretionary
decision,
interlocutory
discretionary
decision
by
the
trial
judge.
