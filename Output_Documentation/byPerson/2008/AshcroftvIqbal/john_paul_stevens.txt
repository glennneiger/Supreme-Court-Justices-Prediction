justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
garre,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
really
arguing
--
i
am
very
sympathetic
to
the
argument
--
that
if
there
was
no
plausible
claim
in
bell
atlantic,
in
which
there
was
a
direct
allegation
of
a
conspiracy
in
violation
of
section
1,
was
rejected
because
the
court
thought
it
implausible,
a
fortiori
this
claim
is
implausible
because
it's
got
exactly
the
same
problems
in
that
you
don't
want
to
subject
these
important
people
to
all
the
inconvenience
of
discovery.
it
seems
to
me
these
cases
are
very,
very
similar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
in
both
of
the
cases,
the
job
of
the
district
judge
would
have
been
made
much
easier
if
one
of
the
defendants
had
filed
an
affidavit
denying
those
allegations,
but
nobody
has
done
that
in
either
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
garre,
can
i
ask
you
a
factual
question
because
i
really
don't
know?
in
the
--
assume
that
--
that
they
had
to
go
to
trial
on
this
case,
which
may
not
be
the
case.
would
they
be
entitled
to
be
defended
by
the
department
of
justice
or
would
they
have
to
get
private
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
applies
even
if
there
would
be
a
trial
later
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
problem
with
the
president
of
the
coca-cola
is
the
allegation
probably
would
be
that
the
coca-cola
company
has
adopted
sloppy
procedures
in
its
manufacturing
lines,
and
the
president
is
responsible
for
those
procedures,
and
that's
why
the
bottles
are
filled
with
rats.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
way
you
would
allege
it.
you
wouldn't
say
he
did
it
personally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
you
would
have
a
similar
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
this
is
a
policy
of
being
derelict
in
the
sanitary
conditions
in
the
plant
and
so
forth
and
so
on;
therefore,
mice
--
mice
are
getting
into
bottles
with
undue
frequency,
and
the
president
is
responsible
for
that.
i
don't
see
that
that's
a
fanciful
allegation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
suggesting
that
coca-cola
really
does
that.
of
course
not,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
standard
theory
is
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just
interrupt?
there
are
a
whole
bunch
of
other
defendants
in
this
case.
as
i
understand
it,
they're
still
in
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
have
discovery
of
maybe
25
to
30
officials
who
would
have
a
lot
of
information
about
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
it's
entirely
possible
that
you
could
either
postpone
discovery
and
dismiss
the
two
principal
defendants
for
now
and
then
bring
them
in
later,
if
the
facts
you
develop
from
the
other
discovery
would
prove
what
you
have
alleged.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
garre,
i
just
wanted
to
--
would
you
say
that
the
--
the
attorney
general
might
be
subject
to
taking
a
deposition,
even
if
he's
not
a
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
--
some
standard
rule
of
law
that
government
officials
don't
have
to
testify
at
proceedings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
certainly
didn't
think
there
was
when
i
wrote
clinton
v.
jones.
[laughter]
