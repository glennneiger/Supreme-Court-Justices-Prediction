mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
qualified
immunity
of
high-ranking
government
officials,
like
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
director
of
the
fbi,
and
supervisory
liability
claims
under
bivens
based
on
the
alleged
wrongdoing
of
much
lower
level
officials.
in
concluding
that
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
sufficient
to
subject
the
high-ranking
officials,
like
the
attorney
general,
to
the
demands
of
civil
discovery,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
two
fundamental
and
interrelated
respects.
first,
the
court
erred
in
concluding
that
the
complaint
stated
a
violation
of
clearly
established
rights
by
the
former
attorney
general
and
director
of
the
fbi,
because
under
this
court's
precedents
the
complaint
fails
adequately
to
plead
the
personal
involvement
of
those
high-ranking
officials
for
the
alleged
discriminatory
acts
of
lower
level
officials.
and,
second--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
is
a
12(b)(6)
motion.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no,
for
two
reasons,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
is
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
a
defense
can
be
a
basis
for
a
motion
to
dismiss
under
12(b)(6).
it
did
so
most
recently
in
the
jones
versus
bock
case.
and
--
and
it's
established
practice
in
the
federal
courts,
in
part
because
of
this
decision,
that
appeals
from
the
denial
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
of
qualified
immunity
are
appropriate.
and,
second,
as
the
second
circuit
recognized
--
and
we
think
it
got
this
right
--
the
question
of
whether
a
complaint
adequately
pleads
the
personal
involvement
of
government
officials
goes
directly
to
the
question
of
qualified
immunity
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
on
page
14a
of
its
decision
--
because
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
these
defendants
have
violated
any
clearly
established
rights.
and
so
the
question
of
supervisory
liability
in
this
case
we
think
is
essential
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
attorney
general
and
director
of
the
fbi
are
entitled
to
qualified
immunity.
and
in
denying
the
government's
--
the
petitioner's
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
of
qualified
immunity,
the
district
court
erroneously
deprived
these
petitioners
of
the
protections
of
that
important
defense.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
think
that
that's
fair,
justice
souter.
i
mean,
i
think
that
there
are
two
general
types
of
allegations
in
this
complaint.
one
set
of
allegations
says
that
petitioners
came
up
with
this
policy,
and
if
you
look
at
those
allegations
--
and
i
think
i
would
point
you
to
paragraph
69
and
paragraphs
10
and
11
--
those
allegations
we
think
describe
a
policy
which
is
neutral
on
its
face,
a
policy
of
holding
persons
determined
by
the
fbi
to
be
of
interest
in
connection
with
a
terribly
important
investigation
until
they
have
been
cleared.
and
so
we
think
that
those
allegations
can't
be
enough
to
sustain
these
--
to
subject
these
petitioners
to
--
to
civil
discovery.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
complaint,
that
--
that
interpretation
doesn't
hold
up.
and
in
particular,
i
would
point
you
to
paragraph
48,
which
is
on
page
164a
of
the
joint
appendix
--
i'm
sorry,
the
petition
appendix.
and
what
that
paragraph
says
is
that
these
allegedly
discriminatory
determinations,
classifications,
were
made
by
fbi
officials
in
the
field,
not
petitioners
here,
the
former
attorney
general
and
director
of
the
fbi.
and
importantly,
these
determinations
were
made,
quote,
and
this
comes
from
paragraph
48,
"without
specific
criteria
or
uniform
classification
system.
"
and
so
that's
what's
going
on
here.
you've
got
a
complaint
that
alleges
that
specific
lower
level
officials
are
making
these
determinations.
that's
in
paragraphs
50
and
51.
you've
got
a
complaint
alleging
that
these
determinations
are
being
made
on
the
basis
of
ad
hoc
criteria.
that's
page
48.
and
then
you
have
these
overarching
allegations
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
the
fbi
knew
about,
approved,
and
condoned
these
discriminatory
conduct
of
much
lower
level
officials.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we've
accepted
that
at
some
level
that
this
complaint
maintains,
and
it's
in
paragraph
69,
that
there
was
a
policy
of
holding
suspects
until
they
--
the
suspects
were
determined
to
be
of
interest
by
the
fbi,
until
they
were
cleared
by
the
fbi
in
connection
with
this
investigation.
that
policy
we
have
not
disputed,
and
that
policy
we
think
is
a
--
is
a
factually
neutral,
perfectly
lawful
law
enforcement
response
to
the
9/11
attacks,
resulting
in--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--not
with
respect
to
the
petitioners
here,
the
former
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
the
fbi,
because
--
and
i
think
in
evaluating--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
the
question
is
which
policy,
what
policy?
and
if
you
look
at
the
complaint,
i
think
the
only
policy
that
the
allegations
bear
out
with
respect
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
the
fbi
is
a
policy
described
in
paragraph
69
of
holding
suspects
until
cleared.
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
i
mean,
certainly
that
is
one
option.
i
mean,
the
court
mentioned
that
in
the
crawford-el
case,
and
that's
an
option.
but
just
as
in
the
bell
atlantic
case,
where
that
was
an
option,
too,
and
where
the
defendants
in
that
case
did
not
avail
themselves
of
their
opportunity
to
file
a
motion
for
a
more
definite
statement,
the
petitioners
here
did
not
do
so
and
they
were
not
required
to
do
so.
they
had
a
different
option
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
move
for
dismissal
under
12(b)(6).
they
exercised
that
option,
and
the
complaint
--
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed
because
it
fails
to
state
a
claim
against
those
individuals.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
think
it's
important
to
distinguish
between
the
different
sets
of
claims.
i
think
the
general
claim
of
a
policy
of
holding
suspects
until
cleared
is
much
more
like
the
bell
atlantic
situation,
where
you
have
got
factually
neutral
allegations,
perfectly
lawful
law
enforcement
conduct
to
have
a
policy
that
says,
fbi
agents,
if
you
determine
these
people
are
of
interest,
hold
them
until
they
are
cleared
so
that
we
are
not
releasing
people
that
are
potentially
suspects
or
wrongdoers
in
this
investigation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
we're
not
asking
for
a
heightened
pleading
standard,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
what's
missing
here
fundamentally
is
a
substantive
requirement
of
the
cause
of
action
--
bivens
--
for
supervisory
liability
which
is
an
affirmative
link.
subsidiary
allegations
suggesting
a
plausible
affirmative
link
between
the
discriminatory
actions
allegedly
taken
by
much
lower
level
officials
in
the
field
and
the
director
of
the
fbi
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
--
it's
not
--
i
mean,
in
--
in
a
similar
way
that
this
court
considered
the
scope
of
a
bivens
cause
of
action
in
the
wilkie
case
recently
and
in
the
hartman
case
recently.
in
both
of
those
cases
the
court
recognized
that
the
scope
of
the
bivens
cause
of
action
goes
directly
to
the
question
of
qualified
immunity.
and
here,
in
order
to
evaluate
whether
the
pleadings
are
adequate
against
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
the
fbi,
you
have
to
know
what
the
substantive
standard
under
bivens
is
for
a
supervisory
liability
type
claim.
you
have
to
know
--
just
as
you
did
in
bell
atlantic,
you
had
to
know
the
substantive
standard
of
antitrust
law
in
this
kind
of
context.
here
you
have
to
know
the
substantive
standard
of
what's
required
to
subject
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
the
director
of
the
fbi
to
potential
liability,
civil
damages,
burdens
of
civil
discovery,
for
supervisory
liability
for
the
claims
of
much
lower
level
officials.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
i
think
it
would
be--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
--
it
says
that,
as
this
court
interpreted
it,
in
rule
8
of
the
rules,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes,
because
in
rule
8--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
rule
8
is
the
--
is
the
plain
statement
showing
entitlement
to
relief.
it
is
the
rule
interpreted
in
bell
atlantic,
and
there
the
bell
atlantic
court
said
that
the
plaintiff
had
the
obligation
to
show
a
plausible
entitlement
to
relief.
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--rule
8
does,
as
interpreted--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
bell
atlantic,
because
that
is
not
a
plausible
entitlement
of
a
claim
to
relief--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
certainly
agree
with
you.
you
don't
have
to
show
that
it
probably
is,
but
you
have
to
show
facts
suggesting
--
above
the
speculative
level.
and
just
as
in
bell
atlantic--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we
certainly
think
--
i
mean,
in
bell
atlantic,
the
court
said
common
economic
experience
would
--
would
support
its
determination
in
that
case.
we
think
here,
and
i
think
the
brief
filed
by
former
attorney
generals
from
several
different
administrations
makes
this
point
as
well,
that
common
government
experience
would
suggest
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
is
not
involved
in
the
sort
of
microscopic
decisions--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
--
and
i
think
that
gets
to
one
of
the
fundamental
problems
with
the
second
circuit
decision,
is
it
held
the
extraordinary
context
of
the
9/11
attacks
and
the
aftermath
of
those
attacks
against
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
and
that's
problematic,
not
only
from
the
qualified-immunity
perspective
of
what
it's
going
to
be
like
for
officials
next
time
they
have
to--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--deal
with
something
like
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but
it's
problematic
because
you
have
to
look
at
the
reality
of
the
job
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
the
director
of
the
fbi.
in
general,
these
are
people
who
are
responsible
not
only
for
the
litigating
divisions
within
the
department
of
justice,
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
the
drug
enforcement
agency,
enforcing
countless
laws.
these
are
people
who
have
extraordinarily
busy
schedules.
and
ordinary--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
rule
26
governs
discovery,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
the
power
to
--
to
govern
discovery
doesn't
solve
the
problem
for
the
same
reason
that
it
didn't
in
bell
atlantic.
the
court
specifically
said
we
are
not
going
to
rely
on
district
courts
to
weed
out
potentially
meritless
claims
because
we
recognize
the
burdens
that
discovery
can
impose
in
the
civil
and
in
trust
contexts.
and
those
burdens
are
multiplied
many
times
here
where
you
are
talking
about
subjecting
to
--
subjecting
high
level
government
official
to
the
burdens
of
civil
discovery.
i
think
fundamentally
we
think
you
don't
get
to
the
question
of
how
do
district
judges
control
discovery,
because
they
haven't
gotten
through
the
gateway
of
pleading
an
adequate
claim.
and
if
i
can
give
you
the
substantive
rule
that
we
think
is
on
point
here
--
this
court,
in
the
rizzo
case,
which
is
a
section
1983
case,
considered
the
question
of
claims
against
high-ranking
officials,
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
the
police
commissioner
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
for
alleged
wrongdoing
by
individual
police
officers
there.
and
there
--
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
a
plaintiff
under
section
1983
has
to
establish,
as
a
matter
of
law,
an
affirmative
link
between
the
acts
of
the
--
the
subordinates
and
the
higher-level
officials.
and
we
think
that
that
substantive
rule
in
section
1983
at
a
minimum
carries
over
to
the
bivens
context.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
sure.
that's
one
protection,
justice
ginsburg.
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
this
court--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it's
certainly
not
adequate
protection,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
would
have
thought
that
this
court's
decision
in
bell
atlantic
put
an
end
to
those
sorts
of
claims
where
the
court--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--absolutely,
justice
stevens.
and
certainly
that's
our
position.
we
think
it's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no
one
did
it
in
either
case,
but
in
both
cases
the
defendants
are
entitled
to
dismissal.
i
think
this
case
is
even
stronger,
not
only
because
we
think
that
the
factual
allegations
are
less
plausible,
but
because
we
have
the
substantive
rule
of
law
that
comes
from
bivens,
that
you
have
to
establish
the
affirmative
link
of
alleged
wrongdoing
between
much
lower
level
officials,
the
fbi
agents
in
the
field
here.
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
the
director
of
the
fbi,
common
experience
shows,
simply
aren't
involved
in
those
sorts
of
granular
decisions.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
let
me
answer
both
those
questions:
first,
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
add
is
interrelated
with
the
first,
and
that's
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
an
overly
expansive
conception
of
the
supervisory
liabilities
available
under
bivens.
and,
i
think,
in
order
to
evaluate
the
adequacy
of
the
pleadings,
this
court
has
to
have
in
mind
the
standards
of
supervisory
liability
that
bivens
applied.
and
we
think
the
that
court
of
appeals
applied
an
overly
expansive
concept
of
that
under
rizzo
and
other
--
the
other
precedents
we
cite
in
our
case.
and
second:
no,
our
case
would
not
go
away
if
this
court
got
rid
of
bell
atlantic
or
if
this
court
limited
bell
atlantic
to
the
antitrust
context.
we
don't
think
the
court
should
do
that.
when
the
court
dispensed
--
disavowed
the
broad
no-set-of-facts
language
from
conley
v.
gibson,
we
took
the
court
to
be
saying:
we
are
disavowing
that
for
all
cases
under
rule
8;
we
are
not
limiting
it
to
parallel
conduct
in
the
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
context.
so
i
think
that
bell
atlantic's
explication
of
rule
8
and
the
disavowal
of
the
no-set-of-facts
language,
which,
after
all,
is
the
test
under
which
the
district
court
had
to
resort
to,
to
sustain
the
claims
in
this
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we
don't
think
you
had
to
wait
for
twombly
to
get
rid
of
those
claims.
we
think
that
many
of
those
claims
would
dismiss.
they
certainly
would
have
been
dismissed
in
the
section
1983
context
under
this
court's
decision
in
rizzo.
and
we
could
talk
about
what
it
would
be
like
for
claims
against
the
president
of
coca-cola
or
ford
motor
company,
but
really
we're
here
talking
about
claims
against
the
highest
level
officials
of
our
government,
who
everyone
agrees
are
entitled
to
the
doctrine
of
qualified
immunity,
a
doctrine
that
was
designed,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
to
protect
the
effective
functioning
of
our
government.
these
officials
are
entitled
at
least
to
the
protections
that
this
court
found
appropriate
for
civil
antitrust
defendants.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
don't
think
so,
justice
ginsburg.
i
mean,
most
fundamentally,
extra-record
materials,
extra-complaint
materials
can't
make
up
for
the
deficiencies
in
the
complaint
itself.
plaintiffs
had
the
benefit
of
that
200-page
report
when
they
brought
their
action
in
this
case.
they
have
amended
their
complaint
twice
already.
and
so,
in
that
respect,
they
are
in
a
much
better
position
than
the
typical
plaintiffs.
and,
secondly,
if
you
look
at
that
report,
if
you
want
to
go
outside
the
record
and
look
at
that
report,
i
would
urge
you
to
look
at
page
70
of
the
report,
which
says
that
"we
found"
--
and
i
am
quoting
from
the
report
--
"we
found
that
the
information
provided
to
high-level
officials
suggested
this
"hold
until
cleared"
policy
was
being
applied
to
persons.
"
suspected
of
being
involved
in
the
9/11
attacks,
a
perfectly
lawful
law
enforcement
program.
and
it
goes
on
to
say
that
"in
practice
the
policy
may
have
been
applied
differently
in
the
field.
"
and
the
other
pages
i
would
point
you
to
are
pages
18,
40,
47,
and
158,
which
make
clear
that
this
--
the
alleged
discriminatory
acts
were
--
were
taken
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
that's
what
the
complaint
in
this
case
says
on
page
48,
where
it
says
that
fbi
officials,
far
removed
from
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
the
fbi,
were
making
these
determinations
without
criteria,
without
a
uniform
classification
system.
and
we
think
that
to
go
back
up
the
chain
to
suggest
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
director
of
the
fbi
may
be
potentially
subject
to
civil
liability,
the
burdens
of
civil
litigation
goes
far
beyond
rule
8
as
it's
described
in
bell
atlantic,
far
beyond
this
court's
qualified
immunity
cases.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
they
are
being
defended
by
the
department
of
justice,
the
--
the
attorney
general
and
director
of
the
fbi.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes,
and
that's
a
discretionary
determination
that
has
been
made
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes,
there
are
other
claims.
there
are
also
claims
that
have
been
made.
and
we
cite
one
of
these
cases,
the
twitty
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
reply.
this
case
involved
a
prisoner
who
claimed
that
he
was
transferred
one
--
from
one
prison
to
the
next
for
a
retaliatory
motive.
they
included
a
claim
against
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
and
the
district
court
said:
well,
under
the
iqbal
claim
that
--
under
the
iqbal
case,
that
case
can
go
forward,
and
potentially
the
attorney
general
can
be
subject
to
civil
--
to
civil
discovery,
which
i
think
underscores
judge
cabranes's
point
that
the
decision
in
this
case
is
a
blue
point
--
is
a
blueprint
for
civil
plaintiffs
who
are
challenging
the
implementation
of
important
law
enforcement
policies
to
subject
the
attorney
general,
the
director
of
the
fbi,
or
other
high-level
officials
to
civil
discovery
based
on
conclusory
and
generally
--
and
general
and
inadequate
allegations.
if
i
could--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--there
are
tort
claims,
federal
tort
claims
acts,
asserted
in
this
case,
and
there's
other
parallel
litigation
going
on
in
the
second
circuit,
justice
ginsburg.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
and,
first,
let
me
clarify
the
record
on
discoveries.
the
second
circuit
didn't
hold
that
discovery
could
not
go
forward
against
these
petitioners.
it
held
that
the
district
court
might
--
that's
the
word
it
used
on
page
67a
of
the
petition
appendix
--
postpone
or
limit
discovery.
so--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--to
the
grace
of
the
district
court,
that's
right,
and
i
think
judge
cabranes
emphasized
the
--
the
concerns
of
potentially
vexatious
discovery
in
this
context,
and
we
certainly
wholeheartedly
agree
with
that.
second,
i
think
mr.
reinert
made
an
important
concession
when
he
acknowledged
that
substantive
standards
of
law
affect
what
you
have
to
plead.
and
here
there
are
two
substantive
standards
--
two
substantive
issues
that
are
key.
one
is
the
standard
for
supervisory
liability
under
bivens,
which
requires
that
the
plaintiff
show
an
affirmative
link
between
the
wrongdoing
alleged
by
lower
level
officials
and
the
potential
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
higher
level
officials
like
the
attorney
general.
the
complaint
in
this
case
has
no
subsidiary
facts
on
which
a
reasonable
person
could
affirm
that
kind
of
affirmative
link.
and,
second,
the
--
the
attorney
general
is
much
different
than
the
president
of
coca-cola
in
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
regularity
of
his
actions.
so
that
--
that
standard
itself
ought
to
affect
how
one
views
the
complaint.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
certainly
we
would
--
we
would
oppose
that.
it's
conceivable
they
could
try
to
get
that
discovery.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't
know
that
there
is
that
standard,
your
honor.
the
same
concerns--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--fair
enough,
your
honor.
but
certainly,
you
know,
when
we
think
they
are
parties
to
the
case
the
potential
demands
of
civil
discovery
and
the
burdens
of
civil
litigation
are
much
greater.
third--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we
are
in
the
realm
of
discovery,
and
we
are
in
the
realm
of
relying
on
the
district
court--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--for
the
reason
this
court
gave
in
bell
atlantic:
we
don't
rely
on
district
court
judges
to
weed
out
potentially
meritless
claims
through
discovery.
we
apply
faithfully
the
pleading
standards.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
think
that
bell
atlantic
answers
that
question
correctly,
your
honor.
third,
context
does
matter.
the
chief
justice
is
right
about
that.
in
evaluating
the
claim,
you
have
to
look
at
the
context
in
which
it
arises.
here
the
fact
it
arises
in
the
qualified
immunity
context
with
respect
to
high-level
officials
is
very
important.
the
higher
up
the
chain
of
command
you
go,
the
less
plausible
it
is
that
the
high-level
official
like
the
attorney
general
is
going
to
be
aware
of
and
know
about
the
sort
of
microscopic
decisions
here:
mistreatment
in
the
federal
detention
facility
in
brooklyn,
alleged
discriminatory
applications
made
by
fbi
agents
in
the
field.
these
are
not
matters
that
one
would
plausibly
assume
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
has
time
out
of
his
busy
day
to
concern
himself
with.
the
second
circuit
decision
should
be
reversed.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you.
