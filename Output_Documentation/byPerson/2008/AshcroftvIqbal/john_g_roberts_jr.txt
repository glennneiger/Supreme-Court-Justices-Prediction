chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
07-1015,
ashcroft
versus
iqbal.
general
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
--
you
don't
dispute
that,
whatever
the
policy
was,
that
it
was
approved
and
condoned
by
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
the
fbi?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
may
--
it
may
very
well
be,
but
isn't
it,
for
purposes
of
a
complaint,
sufficient
to
raise
a
due
process
claim
by
saying
what
they
say?
in
other
words,
you
--
you
may
have
a
very
good
defense
to
it.
you
may
have
something
that
does
not
ever
get
beyond
--
get
them
beyond
the
point
of
summary
judgment.
but
for
them
simply
to
charge
that
there
was
a
policy
in
which
they
picked
up
people
and
they
held
them
until
they
were
cleared,
i.e.,
sort
of
demonstrated
to
be
innocent
in
some
way,
that
at
least
on
the
face
of
it
seems
to
--
to
state
a
due
process
problem
under
the
fifth
amendment,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
--
that
sounds
like
an
argument
on
the
merits
of
the
bivens
claim,
rather
than
an
argument
going
to
qualified
immunity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
reading
the
riot--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--reading
the
riot
act
to
the
lawyer
is
protection
against
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
the
fbi
after
they're
hauled
in
for
discovery
or
subjected
to
depositions
and
the
judge
finds
out--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
mr.
garre.
--the
judge
finds
out
that
there
wasn't
in
fact
a
sufficient
basis
for
it,
and
that
--
that
will
show
them,
if
they
get
read
the
riot
act
by
a
judge?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
reinert.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
a
little
bit
different
--
if
i
could
interrupt
you
--
than
saying,
make
the
conditions
of
confinement
as
harsh
as
possible.
it's
saying,
make
the
conditions
of
confinement
such
that
they
will
not
be
able
to
communicate
with
alleged
--
alleged
--
other
prisoners
that
--
that
might
be
part
of
the
same
group
connected
with
the
activities
on
9/11.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
that
--
to
follow
up
on
justice
breyer's
questioning
of
general
garre,
do
you
believe
that
the
same
pleading
standards
apply
in
the
action
against
the
president
of
coca-cola
as
apply
to
the
actions
of
the
attorney
general
and
director
of
the
fbi
on
the
evening
of
september
11,
2001?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
certainly
or
certainly
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
pleading
standard
--
let's
leave
the
president
of
coca-cola
out
of
it.
the
local
manager
of
the
coca-cola
distribution
center,
you
can
state
that
the
same
rigor
required
in
the
complaint
that
applies
to
him
also
applies
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
the
fbi
in
the
wake
of
9/11?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
--
your
response
then
focuses
solely
on
the
merits
of
the
underlying
claim,
not
any
requirement
of
--
of
heightened
pleading.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
i
thought
--
and
others
may
know
better
in
connection
to
bell
atlantic,
but
i
thought
in
bell
atlantic
what
we
said
is
that
there's
a
standard,
but
it's
an
affected
by
the
context
in
which
the
allegations
are
made.
that
was
a
context
of
a
particular
type
of
antitrust
violation
and
that
affected
how
we
would
look
at
the
complaint.
and
here,
i
think
you
at
least
accept,
don't
you
--
or
i
understood
from
your
answers
to
the
question
on
coca
cola
that
maybe
you
don't
--
that
because
we're
looking
at
litigation
involving
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
fbi
in
connection
with
their
national
security
responsibilities,
that
there
ought
to
be
greater
rigor
applied
to
our
examination
of
the
complaint.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
--
do
you
disagree
with
the
notion
that
bell
atlantic
at
least
established
that
the
level
of
pleading
required
depends
on
the
context
of
the
claim
--
the
context
of
the
particular
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
also
not
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--absurd
and
bizarre
is
also
not
the
pleading
standard,
and
how
are
we
--
to
follow
up
on
justice
souter's
question
--
how
are
we
supposed
to
judge
whether
we
think
it's
more
unlikely
that
the
president
of
coca-cola
would
take
certain
actions
as
opposed
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
was
just
going
to
say
the
--
the
difficulty
with
wrestling
with
the
case
through
the
perspective
of
the
hypothetical
of
the
mice
in
the
bottles
is
that
it's
--
it's
by
its
nature
particularly
absurd,
but
what
if
the
allegation
is
that
the
president
of
coca
cola
is
individually
involved
in
a
particular
price-fixing
scheme?
then
does
this
case
seem
so
terribly
different
from
the
level
of
specificity
bell
atlantic
would
require?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
easy.
i
hope
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
fbi
--
of
the
fbi
knew
of
and
approved
whatever
the
policy
was.
what
you
have
to
show
is
some
facts,
or
at
least
what
you
have
to
allege
are
some
facts,
showing
that
they
knew
of
a
policy
that
was
discriminatory--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--based
on
ethnicity
and
country
of
origin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry
--
swept
up?
you
mean
they
were
in
--
in
prison
because
they
had
violated
immigration
and
other
laws,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
garre,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general
garre--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--mr.
reinert.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-1015,
ashcroft
versus
iqbal.
