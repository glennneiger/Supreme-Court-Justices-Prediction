justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
--
how
does
this
work
in
an
ordinary
case?
i
should
know
the
answer
to
this,
but
i
don't.
it's
a
very
elementary
question.
jones
sues
the
president
of
coca-cola.
his
claim
is
the
president
personally
put
a
mouse
in
the
bottle.
now,
he
has
no
reason
for
thinking
that.
then
his
lawyer
says:
okay,
i'm
now
going
to
take
seven
depositions
of
the
president
of
coca-cola.
the
president
of
coca-cola
says:
you
know,
i
don't
have
time
for
this;
there's
no
basis.
he's
--
he's
--
i
agree
he's
in
good
faith,
but
he's
--
there
is
no
basis.
okay,
i
don't
want
to
go
and
spend
the
time
to
answer
a
question.
where
in
the
rules
does
it
say
he
can
go
to
the
judge
and
say,
judge
--
his
lawyer
will
say
--
my
client
has
nothing
to
do
with
this;
there's
no
basis
for
it;
don't
make
him
answer
the
depositions,
please?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
that
in
the
rules?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
rule
8?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
rule
8
was
move
for
a
more
definite
statement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
shows
a
plausible
entitlement.
he
says
--
there's
no
doubt
it's
a
claim
if
the
president
of
coca-cola
did
put
the
mouse
in
the
bottle.
it's
just
there
is
no
basis
for
thinking
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
wants
to
go
to
the
judge
and
say:
i've
set
out
a
claim
here;
i
copied
it
right
out
of
the
rules.
all
right?
now,
what
allows
the
judge
to
stop
this
deposition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry,
i
just
don't
have
the
answer
to
my
question.
i
must
not
have
said
it
properly.
imagine,
way
before
twombly
--
these
rules
have
been
in
existence
for
decades.
so
we
go
back
years
ago.
certainly,
there
have
been
many
cases
where,
for
whatever
reasons,
the
plaintiffs
included
allegations
that
were
just
factually
very
unlikely.
i
want
to
know
where
the
judge
has
the
power
to
control
discovery
in
the
rules.
that's
--
i
should
know
that.
i
can't
remember
my
civil
procedure
course.
probably,
it
was
taught
on
day
4.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
see
that.
it
says
a
person
has
a
right
to
go
and
get
discovery.
it
doesn't
say
they
only
control
it
under
certain
provisions
which
don't
seem
to
me
to
apply
to
the
truly
absurd
discovery.
there
must
be
some
power
a
judge
has.
and
the
second
question
i'm
going
to
ask
you,
when
you
tell
me
what
that
power
is,
which
apparently
i'm
not
going
to
find
out
--
but
--
but
whatever
that
power
is,
which
must
be
there,
why
doesn't
that
work
to
solve
your
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
--
i
mean,
my
basic
question,
which
i
really
want
to
hear
the
answer
to,
is
the
attorney
general
is
very
busy
and
what
he
does
is
very
important.
the
president
of
coca-cola
is
very
busy.
the
president
of
general
motors
is
very
busy
--
and
very
busy
at
the
moment.
and
what
he
----
[laughter]
what
they
are
doing
is
very
important.
there
are
quite
a
few
people
in
this
country
who
aren't
even
in
the
government,
and
what
they
do
is
very
important
and
they
are
very
busy.
and
so
if
there
is
something
in
these
rules
that
allows
people
to
bring
suits
without
any
factual
foundation,
even
though
the
--
the
complaint
says
there
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'll
bet
those
people
are
being
harassed--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
--
why
isn't
the
protection
--
i
have
the
number
of
the
rule
i
want.
maybe
i
am
not
understanding
it.
but
rule
26(e)(2),
says
--
says,
among
other
things,
that
the
judge
can
change
the
number
of
depositions
you
get.
he
could
reduce
them
to
zero
if,
for
example,
he
decides
the
burden
or
the
expense
outweighs
the
likely
benefit.
can't
he
do
that
whether
you
are
the
president
of
coca
--
cola
or
whether
you
are
the
president
of
ford
or
whether
you
are
the
president,
or
you
are
the
attorney
general?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
he
do
that
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
he
can.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
they
didn't
--
that
isn't
what
96
says.
what
96
says,
which
i
think
is
important,
is
it
says
that
they
knew
of
and
agreed
to
subject
the
plaintiffs
to
these
harsh
conditions
solely
on
account
of
their
religion,
race,
and
national
origin,
and
for
no
legitimate
penological
interest.
because,
if
they
are
looking
for
suspects
from
9/11,
given
the
people
they
found,
it's
not
surprising
that
they
might
look
for
people
who
looked
like
arabs.
all
right?
that
isn't
surprising
to
me,
because
that
was
what
the
suspects
looked
like.
so,
they
want
to
say,
yes,
that
was
part
of
it,
but
it's
not
for
no
legitimate
penological
interest;
it
was
for
every
good
reason:
we
didn't
want
more
bombs
to
go
off.
now,
suppose
that's
their
view.
suppose
also
--
i'm
just
hypothetically
--
they
never,
and
they
know
this,
ever
had
a
conversation
where
they
said,
go
look
for
people
of
arabic
descent
alone.
they
never
said
that.
they
said,
look
for
those
people
who
have
other
connections
and
had
something
we
reasonably
believe
is
9/11-connected;
they
might
be
dangerous.
suppose
that's
what
they
thought.
so
they
read
this,
and
they
think,
judge,
i
want
to
tell
judge
that
you
have
no
evidence
to
show
anything
other
than
what
i
just
said,
which
sounds
as
if
it
might
be
reasonably
connected
to
the
9/11
investigation.
what
is
open
to
our
two
defendants,
if
you
win
this
case?
if
they're
right,
how
do
they
prevent
lots
of
depositions
from
coming
in
and
taking
their
time?
how
do
they
prevent
this
case
dragging
on
and
taking
their
time?
if
the
facts
are
what
i
just
said,
rather
than
what
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they'll
--
they'll
deny
the
facts;
then
you'll
say
there's
a
factual
matter.
and
suppose
hypothetically
--
not
what
you
think
--
but
you
have
no
reason
at
all
hypothetically,
imagine,
for
believing
that
they
did
this
solely
for
racial
reasons
unrelated
to
the
investigation
of
9/11.
suppose
you
don't
have
any
information
that
shows
that,
and
they
are
going
to
say
everything
else
is
covered
by
qualified
immunity,
and
you
have
nothing
else.
then
what
do
they
do
to
get
out
of
10
years
of
discovery?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
you
can't
make
this
argument
under
26(b)(2)(c)
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
judge
there
is
supposed
to
weigh
burdens
versus
desirability
of
going
forward.
and
so
why
don't
you
make
this
argument
right
at
that
point?
if
you
are
right
you
win;
if
not,
you
lose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
also
true,
i
guess,
of
complaints,
and
every
other
legal
question.
