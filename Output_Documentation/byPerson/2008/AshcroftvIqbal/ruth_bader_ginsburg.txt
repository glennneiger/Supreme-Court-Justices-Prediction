justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
garre,
will
you
clarify
one
point?
you
said
"fails
to
state"
enough
to
overcome
qualified
immunity.
but,
usually,
these
--
the
pleading
is
analyzed
discretely.
this
is
a
12(b)(6)
motion,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
that
tests
just
the
pleading.
qualified
immunity
is
an
affirmative
defense
which
hasn't
even
been
stated
formally.
so
isn't
it
entirely
conceivable
that
you
could
have
a
good
complaint
judged
from
the
12(b)(6)
point
of
view,
but
when
the
qualified
immunity
defense
is
asserted,
the
plaintiff
isn't
able
to
come
up
with
enough
to
stave
off
a
summary
judgment
motion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
garre,
i
think
that
the
bell
atlantic
case
--
and
--
and
i'm
sure
that
justice
souter
will
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
this,
but
most
of
it
is
about
what
it
takes
--
what
are
the
essential
elements
of
a
sherman
section
1
charge.
and
there's
a
big
mistake
that
the
pleaders
are
making;
that
is,
there
has
to
be
an
agreement,
and
they
haven't
alleged
an
agreement.
this
case
seems
to
be
quite
different.
and
i
think
you
have
taken
bell
atlantic,
frankly,
for
more
than
is
there.
that
is,
twice
--
at
least
twice
in
the
opinion,
the
court
says,
we
are
not
developing
any
heightened
pleading
rules.
form
11
is
as
good
today
as
it
was
yesterday.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
missing
--
is
an
essential
element
to
a
substantive
claim
for
relief.
i
thought
that's
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
about
rule
11
to
take
care
of
justice
breyer's
problem?
the
judge
would
say
to
the
lawyer:
now,
you
signed
this
pleading,
and
when
you
made
--
you
signed
it,
you
made
certain
representations,
and
i'm
going
to
read
the
riot
act
to
you
if
it
turns
out
that
this
is
a
frivolous
petition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
was
responding
to
justice
breyer's
coca-cola
president.
i
think
rule
11
would
work
quite
well
to
answer
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
garre,
there
was
a
reference,
i
think,
in
judge
gleason's
decision
in
the
eastern
district
to
the
office
of
the
inspector
general
report
on
the
detainees'
treatment
at
the
metropolitan
detention
center.
is
there
nothing
in
those
reports
that
lends
some
plausibility
to
iqbal's
claims?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
other
litigation,
general
garre,
pending
with
respect
to
the
detentions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
--
is
there
a
tort
claims
act
action
pending
or
--
i
don't
know
where
i
got
that
impression
--
arising
out
of
these
detentions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting
general
garre's
statement
he
just
made
to
us
--
he
said
there's
nothing
in
the
office
of
the
inspector
general's
report
that
suggests
that
the
attorney
general
or
the
head
of
the
fbi
were
engaged
in
any
wrongdoing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
statute
of
limitations
that
would
apply?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
--
you
have
not
had
discovery
from
the
attorney
general
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
it's
--
it's
as
though
discovery
with
respect
to
those
two
defendants
was
stayed
pending
your
discovery
from
the
lower
level
defendants?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
it
limited
to
people
who
were
already
indicted
on
other
charges?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
not
dealing
with
the
universe
of
men
who
are
of
a
certain
national
origin;
we
are
dealing
with
only
ones
who
were
incarcerated
for
an
offense
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
terrorism.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
--
it
did
happen?
at
least
it
did--
