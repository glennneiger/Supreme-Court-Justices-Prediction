justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
stewart,
could
i
follow
up
on
one
other
thing
that
came
up
during
the
preceding
argument?
isn't
the
issue
whether
there
was
or
was
not
probable
cause
quite
separate
from
the
consent
once
removed
doctrine?
what
--
assuming
that
there
was
probable
cause
here,
there
may
be
many
instances
in
which
the
consent
once
removed
doctrine
would
be
applied,
if
it's
a
valid
doctrine,
where
there
wasn't
previously
probable
cause.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
are
advocating
a
rule
that
is
going
to
get
police
officers
killed,
aren't
they
--
aren't
you?
if
an
undercover
police
officer
is
in
a
house
making
drug
buy,
and
you
want
to
say
that
the
single
officer
who
is
there
in
an
undercover
capacity
can
say,
"you
guys
are
all
under
arrest.
"
he
can't
signal
for
other
police
officers
to
come
in
and
help
him
effect
the
arrest
without
anybody
being
killed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
--
what
if
the
officers
in
this
case
had
read
the
seventh
circuit
decision,
and
they
said
these
are
judges
on
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
and
they
think
this
is
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment?
and
what's
more,
one
of
these
is
written
--
one
of
these
opinions
is
written
by
judge
posner,
and
he's
the
smartest
man
in
the
world
----
[laughter]
he
knows
everything
there
is
to
know
about
law
and
economics
and
jurisprudence
and
literature
and
many
other
subjects.
is
it
unreasonable
for
them
to
follow
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
your
argument
that
in
a
situation
where
the
exigent
circumstances
are
the
creation
of
the
scenario
that
the
police
have
set
up,
the
police
cannot
--
and
you
have
a
police
officer
who
is
being
the
undercover
operative
who
has
the
power
to
make
an
arrest,
that
police
officer
cannot
signal
for
other
officers
to
come
in
and
assist
with
the
arrest?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
additional
officers
would
--
that
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
even
if
there
is
an
officer
safety
problem
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
probable
cause
solve
the
problem
at
all?
there
is
clearly
probable
cause
here.
they
are
listening
to
what
goes
on.
so
they're
--
do
you
dispute
that
when
they
hear
that
the
drug
transaction
is
taking
place,
that
they
lack
probable
cause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
it
there
is
a
state
statute
that
says
that
confidential
informants
may
be
designated
by
the
police
department
to
assist
in
making
arrests?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
first
case
is
pearson
versus
callahan
07-751.
this
case
comes
to
us
under
the
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
state
law
enforcement
officers
conducted
a
warrantless
search
of
respondent's
house
incident
to
his
arrest
for
the
sale
of
drugs
to
an
undercover
informant
whom
he
had
voluntarily
admitted
to
the
premises.
the
respondent
sued
the
officers
for
violating
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
officers
were
not
entitled
to
summary
judgment
on
qualified
immunity
grounds.
in
granting
review,
we
ask
the
parties
to
brief
the
additional
question
whether
the
mandatory
procedure
for
considering
qualified
immunity
claim
set
out
in
saucier
versus
katz
should
be
retained.
for
reasons
set
out
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
saucier
procedure
should
not
be
regarded
as
mandatory
but
should
be
left
into
the
sound
discretion
of
the
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeals.
we
also
hold
that
the
petitioner's
summary
judgment
motion
should
have
been
granted
because
it
was
not
clearly
established
at
the
time
in
question
that
the
search
was
unconstitutional.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
