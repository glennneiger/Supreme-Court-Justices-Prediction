justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
misses
the
point
of
the
case.
i
mean,
the
point
of
the
case
is
that
consent
to
the
police
was
established,
consent
to
police
informants
was
not,
and
that
when
i
consent
i
am
not
consenting
to
the
--
to
the
whole
world.
if
i
am
consenting
to
somebody
who
is
not
a
police
officer,
that
is
not
equivalent
to
consenting
to
a
police
officer.
that's
the
point
of
the
case;
and
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
--
there
was
only
one
case
at
the
time
that
this
occurred
which
equated
the
confidential
informant
for
the
police
with
the
police;
and
that
was
the
seventh
circuit
case;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that
--
that
equates
--
in
terms
of
existing
law,
that
equates
the
government
agent,
which
in
this
case
is
not
a
police
officer,
but
a
confidential
informant,
with
a
police
officer.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
nub
of
the
case:
is
that
person
equivalent,
so
that
consent
to
one
in
effect
is
consent
to
as
many
police
as
want
to
come
in,
or
is
it
not
the
case?
and
it
seems
to
me
what
you
have
got
to
argue
here
is
that
the
confidential
informant
and
the
police
officer
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
should
be
treated
as
identical.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
there
is
no
clear
law
on
that.
that's
why
we
are
here.
there's
one
--
at
the
time
that
this
search
was
made,
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
only
one
case
which
held
there
was
such
an
equivalence,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
first
--
i
want
to
hear
what
you
say,
but
tell
me,
is
it
correct
that
at
that
time
there
was
one
case
that
held
the
equivalence?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
was
not
a
circuit
case,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
district
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
were
three
circuit
court
holdings
that
the
confidential
informant
was
equivalent
to
a
police
officer?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
did
you
--
now,
do
you
have
other
circuits
that
held
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
where
is
pollard
from?
justice
david
h.
souter
sixth.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now
why
--
why
are
they
correct?
why
should
the
confidential
informant
be
treated
as
equivalent
to
a
police
officer?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
was
trying
--
and
he
was
trying
to
make
a
deal
to
get
leniency
with
the
police.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
--
you
certainly
cannot
argue
--
maybe
you
are,
but
i
don't
see
how
can
you
argue
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg
that
the
integrity
to
be
expected
from
a
confidential
informant,
taking
that
as
a
category
of
law
including
all
sorts
of
informants,
is
the
integrity
that
we
would
expect
in
a
police
officer.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
can't
i?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
if
that
--
if
that
is
true,
as
it
clearly
is,
they
run
the
gamut
from
the
good
to
the
bad.
you
can't
make
--
adopt
the
proposition
categorically
that
confidential
informants
should
be
regarded
as
having
the
same
integrity
as
a
police
officer.
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
talking
about
probable
cause.
if
they
got
a
warrant
within
an
hour
or
two
of
the
time
that
that
informant
says
he
saw
them
there,
do
you
seriously
question
whether
there
would
be
probable
cause?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we're
asking
for
the
basis.
you're
asking
for
a
rule
and
our
questions
go
to
the
reason
for
having
that
rule.
and
the
officers
may
have
said
--
and
i
will
assume
they
said
--
in
this
case:
oh,
gee,
we
weren't
sure
the
drugs
would
still
be
there.
but
in
terms
of
probable
cause
law,
that's
just
not
a
serious
answer,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
don't
even
need
an
anticipatory
warrant.
they
need
a
warrant
to
go
in
and
search
that
place
on
the
grounds
that
there
are
probably
drugs
there,
and
if
they
saw
drugs
there
a
couple
of
hours
beforehand
and
they
had
no
affirmative
evidence
which
they
should
bring
forward
under
the
frank
standard
to
indicate
that
the
drugs
were
being
taken
out,
is
there
any
serious
question
that
probable
cause
would
be
found?
justice
david
h.
souter
an
informant
just
came
out
and
said
there
were
drugs
there
and
they
don't
have
probable
cause?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
reason
the
police
are
being
faulted
is
that
they
didn't
get
a
warrant.
and
the
warrant
requirement
is
a
generally
good
starting
place
for
a
fourth
amendment
argument.
justice
ginsburg's
point
is
that
if
they
had
an
informant
who
had
seen
drugs
in
the
place
within
two
hours,
they
had,
if
they'd
been
before
a
magistrate,
the
basis
in
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant.
and
i
still
haven't
heard
why
in
fact
they
couldn't
have
got
one
or
why
they
didn't
have
the
probable
cause.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
interested
in
what
they
personally
believed.
we're
talking
about
objective
fourth
amendment
standards.
did
they
or
did
they
not
have
a
basis
to
establish
probable
cause
at
that
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
will
admit
that
is
the
most
astonishing
view
of
probable
cause
i
have
heard
in
this
courtroom.
of
course
they
had.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't
it?
as
i
understand,
the
record
evidence
is
that
their
informant
was
in
that
guy's
home,
and
within
two
hours
of
the
point
that
we
went
through,
the
second
entry,
he
had
seen
drugs.
why
wasn't
there
probable
cause
within
that
two-hour
period?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
a
reasonable
belief?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
probable
cause,
not
an
establishment
of
mathematical
certainty.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
clearly
would
have
been
if
they
had
sent
a
police
officer
in.
you're
asking
us
to
extend
the
police
officer
rule
to
include
a
confidential
informant
rule.
one
reason
for
doing
so
is,
or
would
be,
that
in
practical
terms
there
is
a
need
for
it.
justice
ginsburg's
question
was,
why
is
there
a
need
for
it,
when
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant?
and
we
still
haven't
heard
an
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
didn't
they
use
the
confidential
informant
to
get
a
warrant?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
doesn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
our
question
is
should
consent
once
removed
be
recognized
as
a
doctrine
that
covers
the
confidential
informant
in
this
case,
one
question
that
we
may
sensibly
ask
is,
is
there
a
need
to
recognize
that
broad
a
consent
doctrine?
and
one
question
that
would
bear
on
that
would
be,
in
these
cases,
is
there
difficulty
or
impossibility
of
getting
a
warrant
under
normal
probable
cause
standards?
and
i
think
that
was
the
point
of
justice
ginsburg's
question.
do
you
doubt
that
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
within
the
two-hour
period?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
reason
it's
insubstantial
is
that
we
have
a
rule
for
independent
reasons
having
nothing
necessarily
to
do
with
this
kind
of
situation
in
which
one
officer's
knowledge
is
regarded
as
another
officer's
knowledge.
the
police
are
regarded
as
a
group,
so
that
we
have
a
rule
ready,
in
place,
saying:
you
show
one,
you
have
shown
the
whole
department.
we
don't,
however,
have
any
such
rule
with
respect
to
agents
generally.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
metzler,
what
do
you
say
to
this
line
of
reasoning,
we
have
in
prior
cases
adopted
the
positions
that
for
purposes
of
establishing
probable
cause,
the
knowledge
of
one
police
officer
is
also
the
knowledge
of
all
police
officers,
at
least
within
a
department
or
working
on
a
particular
problem.
so
that
if
in
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
search
without
a
warrant,
if
you
add
up
everything
that
individual
officers
knew
and
that
amounts
to
probable
cause,
then
the
search
is
good.
why
don't
we
apply,
in
effect,
the
same
rule
in
the
hypothetical
case
that
you
have
been
given,
which
is
a
police
officer
who
was
admitted
by
consent
and
there
are
other
police
officers
outside.
at
the
point
at
which
the
police
officer
who
has
been
admitted
has
the
knowledge
necessary
for
an
arrest
and
has
that
knowledge
as
a
result
of
the
invitation
and
the
waiver
of
privacy
as
to
him,
why
don't
we
regard
that
on
sort
of
general
doctrinal
grounds
as
a
waiver
of
privacy
with
respect
to
the
police
in
general,
just
as
we
regard
police
knowledge
as
being
imputed
to
all
police
officers?
that
way
you
don't
have
the
problem
that,
for
example,
justice
kennedy's
hypo
raises,
even
in
the
case
of
exigent
circumstances.
but
it
doesn't
open
the
door
to
what
you
were
objecting
to
here.
why
isn't
that
a
proper
solution
or
proper
answer
to
this
hypo?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
you
are
absolutely
right
in
terms
of
his
psychological
process,
the
only
person
he
has
invited
in
is
the
one
person.
the
reason
for
coming
up
with
the
answer
i
suggested
is
a
broader
doctrinal
reason.
that
is
the
reason
that
we
have
for
probable
cause
purposes
regarded
the
police
--
or
the
knowledge
of
one
police
officer
as
the
knowledge
for
all.
why
don't
we,
for
the
same
reasons,
since
it
is
privacy
that
is
at
stake
in
all
of
these
cases,
regard
the
invitation
of
one
police
officer
as
the
invitation
of
all,
or
to
all?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would
be
consent
to
one
officer
plus
a
doctrinal
basis
to
construe
that
consent
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
as
a
broader
consent.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
we
would
be
doing.
we
wouldn't
be
doing
it
because
the
individual
in
the
trailer
says
i
am
inviting
in
the
whole
l.a.
police
department.
we
are
doing
it
because
he
invites
one
l.a.
police
officer
in,
and
we
have
doctrinal
basis
for
regarding
the
police,
as
it
were,
collectively
rather
than
individually
for
probable
cause
purposes
when
privacy
is
at
stake.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
it
not
open
the
door
to,
i
guess,
to
what
you
are
objecting
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
i
think
i
may
have
created
this
problem
for
you
and
--
and
maybe
i
--
i
should
get
you
out
of
it.
[laughter]
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
probable
cause
rule
is
what
is
operative
here.
i'm
saying
that
for
probable
cause
purposes
we
regard
the
police
collectively,
and
why,
since
our
privacy
is
at
stake
there
and
is
at
stake
here
--
why
shouldn't
we
have
a
collective
consent
rule,
too?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
--
that's
my
proposal.
