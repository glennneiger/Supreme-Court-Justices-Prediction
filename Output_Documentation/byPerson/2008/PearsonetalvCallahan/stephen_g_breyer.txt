it
is
quite
difficult.
i
mean
there
--
we
don't
know
quite
a
lot
about
whether
they
would
have
gotten
a
warrant,
how
--
how
dangerous
it
was,
whether
the
drugs
were
likely
to
be
hidden.
and
i
was
thinking
of
it,
and
that's
why
i
am
saying
this,
is
that
it's
a
perfect
reason
since
constitutional
questions
in
this
area
are
--
are
like
the
stars
in
the
sky.
there
are
so
many.
rather
than
having
the
judges
answer
each
one
and
getting
everything
mixed
up,
why
not
just
have
them
take
whatever
is
the
easier
path?
as
a
judge
i
like
to
take
what
is
the
easier
path.

stephen

and
if
it's
easier
to
deal
with
the
qualified
immunity,
deal
with
it
and
forget
the
rest
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
that,
but
unless
we
do
that
here,
they
are
never
going
to
get
the
right
message.
and
so
what
we
will
have
is
1,000
judges
trying
in
an
average
in
a
year
50
or
60
cases
each
with
multiple
facts,
and
we
will
have
approximately
over
a
10-year
period
hundreds
of
thousands.
i've
exaggerated,
but
there
will
be
many,
many
--
many,
many
conflicts,
many,
many
confusions.
and
unless
we
say,
no,
we
are
not
doing
it
ourselves,
how
will
they
ever
get
the
message?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
don't
always
have
to
do
it,
but
i
mean
once.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
the
question.
i
mean,
look,
if
i
have
to
answer
the
constitutional
question
--
and
what
bothers
me
is
this
consent
at
one
remove.
what?
you
are
saying
a
drug
seller
who
lets
in
a
disguised
policeman
in
order
to
sell
him
a
drug
because
he
thinks
he's
a
druggie
is
suddenly
consenting
to
the
entire
lapd
coming
into
his
house?
i
would
think
that
is
the
last
thing
he
would
have
thought
about
wanting,
not
the
first.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
maybe
they
both
should
be
the
same.
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
imagining
--
you
are
imagining
different
cases.
we
can
imagine
a
spectrum
of
cases.
in
some
cases
the
policeman
or
the
confidential
informant
will
be
there,
and
he
really
couldn't
have
gotten
a
--
a
thing
in
advance
--
a
warrant
in
advance.
it
wasn't
certain,
and
they
are
in
there
and
they
see
a
lot
of
drug
behavior
going
on,
and
the
drugs
are
going
to
be
hidden,
go,
disappear
the
second
he
leaves;
and
if
he
tries
to
arrest
them,
everybody
is
going
to
jump
on
him
and
kill
him.
okay?
so
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
just
like
this
one,
but
with
a
few
changes,
which
are
--
he
needs
to
call
the
police,
and
there
will
be
others
where
he
doesn't.
so
that's
why
i
am
so
uncertain
about
what
it
is
we
are
deciding
here
on
the
merits.
we
would
have
to
say
on
the
merits
this
is
a
case
where
there
are
no
exigent
circumstances.
can
we
say
that?
i
--
would
not
want
to
"never
are
there".
