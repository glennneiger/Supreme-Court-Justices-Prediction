mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
police
entry
in
this
case
was
constitutional
and,
in
any
event,
did
not
infringe
any
constitutional
right
that
was
clearly
established
at
the
time
the
officers
acted.
the
mandatory
order
of
decision
for
qualified
immunity
cases
announced
in
saucier
v.
katz
should
be
overruled.
i
did
want
to
begin
by
clarifying
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
because
i'm
not
sure
if
it
was
entirely
clear.
there
were
really
two
cases
here,
one
of
which
was
the
criminal
prosecution
of
mr.
callahan,
the
respondent
in
this
court.
and
the
individual
officers
were
not
parties
as
to
that
case.
that
was
handled
by
the
state
of
utah.
and
you're
correct
that
in
the
criminal
proceeding
the
consent
once
removed
argument
was
not
made.
and
that
led
to
the
motion
to
suppress
ultimately
being
granted
and
consequently
mr.
callahan
was
not
subject
to
criminal
proceedings.
mr.
callahan
did
file
a
civil
suit
against
the
individual
officers
who
were
involved
in
effecting
the
arrest,
and
in
that
civil
proceeding
the
consent
once
removed
argument
was
made
all
the
way
up.
it
was
made
in
the
district
court,
and
it
was
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
well.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
i
think
the
consent
once
removed
doctrine
would
have
its
greatest
utility
in
cases
where
the
police
suspect
but
don't
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
particular
individual
is
engaged
in
criminal
activity,
and
so
they
send
an
informant
or
an
undercover
police
officer
in
to
try
to
either
confirm
or
dispel
their
suspicions.
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
a
warrant
at
the
outset
because
they
would
not
have
probable
cause
at
that
time
of
ongoing
criminal
conduct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
certainly
think
that
they
had
probable
cause.
there
was
testimony
from
police
officers
to
the
effect
that
magistrates
in
utah
would
be
reluctant
to
grant
warrants
based
on
these
circumstances
because
of
the
possibility
that
the
drugs
would
be
dissipated.
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
second-guess
their
empirical
experience
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
utah
magistrates
will
and
will
not
grant
warrants.
but
we
think
as
a
legal
matter
that
there
was
probable
cause,
and
that
a
warrant
should
have
been
issued.
but
certainly
there
are
--
there
are
plenty
of
circumstances--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
--
i
would
think
that
with
either
police
officers
or
with
informants
you
could
have
some
situations
in
which
the
undercover
operative
has
very
recently
attempted
to
confirm
the
presence
of
drugs.
and
you
can
have
other
cases
in
which
the
undercover
operative,
again
either
an
informant
or
a
police
officer,
could
hear
rumors
on
the
street
that
a
particular
individual
was
engaged
in
drug-dealing,
might
not
have
probable
cause,
and
they
might
decide
that
the
best
way
to
set
up
the
operation
was
to
send
this
person
in
to
attempt
to
make
a
buy
at
a
time
when
probable
cause
was
lacking.
but
they
would
want
to
arrange
the
operation
in
such
a
way
that
if
the
operative's
experience
confirmed
their
suspicions
and
gave
them
probable
cause
to
arrest,
they
would
be
able
to
go
in
immediately.
and
our
principal
contention
is
not
that
the
consent
to
the
entry
of
bartholomew
was
implicit
consent
to
the
later
entry
of
the
police
officers.
it
was
that
once
a
person
has,
even
unknowingly,
admitted
a
government
agent
into
his
home,
his
expectation
of
privacy
is
sharply
reduced
and
the
entry
of
the
officers
works
an
insubstantial
incremental
invasion
of
privacy.
and
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
point
that
mr.
stirba
was
making.
it's
true
that
the
informant
here
lacked
the
training
and
skills
that
--
and
integrity,
for
that
matter,
that
you
would
expect
a
police
officer
to
have.
but
he
was
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
a
government
agent
a
state
actor.
if
his
handlers
had
instructed
him
to
look
for
an
opportunity
to
rummage
through
the
drawers--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
think
that
this
court
in
this
case
should
address
the
constitutional
question
first
because
it
is
the
subject
of
the
square
circuit
conflict,
it's
been
briefed
and
argued,
it's
a
question
that
independently
warrants
resolution.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
the
first
thing
i
would
say
in
response
to
that
is
we
think
that
the
--
the
balance
or
the
way
in
which
discretion
will
ordinarily
be
exercised
will
typically
be
different
in
the
case
of
the
lower
courts
than
in
the
case
of
this
court,
because
the
principal
role
of
the
lower
federal
courts
is
to
decide
individual
cases
before
them
usually
in
the
most
expeditious
and
noncontroversial
way
where
they--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
they
will
get
the
message--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
they
will
get
the
message
if
the
court
tells
them
that
the
mandatory
rule
of
saucier
is
no
longer
in
effect,
that
courts
have
discretion
to
decide
based
on
their
sound
judgment
whether
it
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
in
one
sense
it's
an
advisory
opinion,
but
in
another
sense
there
are
--
there
are
often
cases
in
which
two
alternative
grounds
for
a
decision
are
proffered,
either
one
of
which,
if
accepted,
would
compel
a
judgment
in
one
litigant's
favor.
and
the
fact
that
it
would
theoretically
--
if
the
court
concludes
there
is
only--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
it's
true
that
if
the
court
announced
that
this
search
was
constitutional,
that
it
would
necessarily
be
saying:
and
there
was
no
clearly
established
constitutional
law
to
the
contrary
at
the
time
the
officers
acted.
but
the
court--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
that
--
that
would
be
equally
true
in
the
case
of
the
undercover
police
officer.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
we
think
he
could
automatically
ask
for
the
police
to
come
into
the
home
because
the
incremental
intrusion
on
privacy
by
having
several
police
officers
rather
than
one
to
make
the
arrest
would
be
insubstantial.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
you
don't
have
that
precise
rule,
but
it
is
nevertheless
the
case
that
the
undercover
operative
here,
the
informant,
was
a
state
actor.
had
he
been
instructed
to
look
in
private
places
without
consent,
his
conduct
would
have
constituted
a
fourth
amendment
violation
because
he
would
have
been
regarded
for
that
purpose
as
--
as
an
agent
of
the
state,
and
he
should,
therefore,
be
regarded
as
a
state
agent
for
these
purposes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
think
this
--
this
court
has
ever
squarely
so
held.
i
believe
that
the
respondents
concede
that
because
they
don't
take
issue
with
the
fact
that
consent
once
removed
is
applicable
when
the
person
already
inside
is
an
undercover
police
officer.
