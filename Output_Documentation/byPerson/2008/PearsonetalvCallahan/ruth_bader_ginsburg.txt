oh,
but
there
is
an
enormous
difference
between
the
training
and
the
character
of
a
police
officer
and,
as
this
very
case
illustrates,
the
confidential
informants
are
often
very
shady
characters
who
can't
be
counted
on
to
be
truth-tellers,
and
have
a
powerful
incentive
to
get
someone
for
the
police,
because
in
most
cases
they
are
seeking
to
have
their
own
case
dealt
with
sympathetically.
so,
how
can
you
equate
a
police
officer
with
a
confidential
informer,
who
is
usually
someone
who
knows
where
the
drug
house
is
because
he's
a
dealer
himself?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
this
one?
wasn't
this
one
that
fits
my
description,
the
one
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one
feature
of
this
is
that
i
think
is
really
puzzling:
what
this
case
is
about
is
the
fourth
amendment,
that
requires,
with
certain
exceptions,
the
main
rule
is
to
get
a
warrant.
and
here
you
have
a
confidential
informer
going
to
the
place
to
make
sure
that
they
really
do
have
the
goods.
then
he
goes
back
to
the
police.
he
spends
two
hours.
he's
being
wired
and
whatever
else.
why
didn't
somebody
pick
up
the
phone
and
get
a
warrant
at
that
point?
the
confidential
informer
could
say:
"i
was
there
and
i
saw
the
drugs.
"
what
--
the
whole
purpose
of
these
rules
is
to
have
the
police
get
a
warrant
when
they
can.
and
how
do
you
explain
that
two
hours
lapse
between
when
they
had
probable
cause
and
when
the
--
when
the
informant
returns
for
the
second
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
it
was
established
not
only
that
there
were
drugs,
but
that
he
actually
tasted
some.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
just
establish
one
thing?
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong.
that
this
argument
about
consent
once
removed
was
not
presented
in
the
lower
courts.
that
is,
in
the
trial
court
you
argued
exigent
circumstances,
and
then
on
appeal
the
inevitable
discovery
rule.
so
there
was
--
in
the
courts
below,
this
was
not
given
as
the
reason,
the
consent
once
removed
was
not
alleged
as
the
basis,
as
the
justification
for
this
search?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
--
it's
not
just
this
case.
maybe
you
can
tell
me.
i
thought
because
they
were
dealing
with
a
confidential
informant
rather
than
a
police
officer,
they
sent
him
in
to
do
the
dry
run.
i
mean
the
--
in
the
police
officer
cases
usually
the
--
the
undercover
police
officer
goes
in.
the
other
police
officers
are
there
ready
to
come
in
when
he
gives
them
the
signal.
but
the
police
officers
don't
ordinarily
go
through
this
dry
run
that
they
had
here
with
the
confidential
informer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
are
talking
about
the
main
role
of
police
is
get
a
warrant,
except
--
and
i
think
the
court
has
said
a
number
of
times
to
make
this
search
reasonable,
the
police
have
to
get
a
warrant
if
you
want
to
interject
the
judicial
between
police
and
the
person
in
jeopardy.
so
the
main
rule
is
warrant
unless
--
and
then
you
have
exceptions,
but
i
think
your
point
is
that
there
is
a
main
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
court
has
gotten
from
the
constitution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
get
a
warrant
if
you
can.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
citizen's
arrest,
i
think
it
was
part
of
this
record
that
--
that
they
do
not
want
confidential
informers
to
go
making
arrests,
so
that
the
police
distinguish
the
confidential
informer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
going
back
to
why
should
we
decide
this
question,
particularly
in
fourth
amendment
cases
when
these
issues
will
come
up
on
suppression
motions,
so
there
isn't
a
need
to
decide
them
in
the
--
in
the
civil
context.
