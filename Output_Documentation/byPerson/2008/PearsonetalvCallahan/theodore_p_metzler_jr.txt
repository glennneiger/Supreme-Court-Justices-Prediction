mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
consent.
by
consenting
to
the
entry
of
a
confidential
informant,
that
mr.
callahan
consented
to
the
entry
of
police.
the
answer
is
no,
and
no
reasonable
officer
could
have
believed
otherwise.
this
court
has
long
held
that
it
is
presumptively
unreasonable
for
police
to
enter
a
home
without
consent
or
exigent
circumstances
or
a
warrant.
here
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances;
there
was
no
warrant,
nor
was
there
any
consent.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
no,
your
honor.
we
think
it's
a
closer
case,
but
if
it
is
a
--
if
this
confidential
informant
had
been
a
police
officer,
it
would
be
the
same
analysis.
there
is
no
exigent
circumstance
here;
there
is
no
consent.
and
--
and
the
consent
to
be
competent
to
the
police
officer
in
your
case
would
not
extend
to
the
police
officer
in
your
case
would
not
extend
to
the--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--yes.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--he
could
make
the
arrest
by
himself.
but--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--correct.
if
--
if
there
are
some
sort
of
exigent
circumstances,
in
this
case
they
would
plan
that
in
advance;
and
police
are
not
allowed
to
create
their
own
exigency
to
get
around
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
of
course,
the
safest
thing
for
him
would
be
to
simply
withdraw,
get
on
the
telephone,
and
get
a
warrant
to
come
back
in,
or
during
the
two
hours
that
they
were
planning
this
entry
he
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
then
or
an
anticipatory
warrant.
there
are
plenty
of
stated
options.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
well,
to
the
extent
they
planned
it
in
advance,
and
the
basis
of
their
entry--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--well,
if
they
--
if
they
planned
on
an
exigent
circumstance
as
being
the
reason
that
they
are
allowed
to
go
in,
under
this
court's
decision
--
the
long
line
of
decisions
in
payton
and
steagald
saying
exigent
circumstances
or
consent
are
the
way
to
get
in
without
a
warrant,
then
it
would
not
be
permissible.
if--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--i
think
certainly
in
this
case
there
were
not
exigent
circumstances.
the
informant
was
on
his
way
out
the
door.
he
--
he
wasn't
attempting
to
make
an
arrest.
no
one
thought
that
the
--
that
mr.
callahan
would
destroy
the
drugs
or
that
anyone
would
leave.
in
fact,
the
petitioners
abandoned
exigent
circumstances
in
the
court
of
appeal.
so
i
think
you
can
decide
this
case
on
the
merits,
as
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances.
and
then
ask,
is
it
reasonable
to
think
that
because
there
was
an
informant
inside
and
because
he
sent
out
a
signal
that
there
was
probable
cause,
a
drug
transaction
had
happened
inside
the
house,
does
that
make
any
difference
whatsoever
as
to
whether
there
was
consent?
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
it's
a
difficult
question.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
well,
with
regard
to
the
saucier
question,
we
think
the
court
should
keep
the
saucier
question,
and
particularly
in
this
case
where
there
is
a
circuit
split,
the
court
should
decide
the
constitutional
question
and
not
move
on
to
the
clearly
established
question--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--yes.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
it
certainly
could
come
up--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
certainly.
mr.
callahan
did
sue
the
county
in
this
case.
but--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--well,
this
court
in
payton
and
steagald--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--i
didn't
hear
the
justice's
questions.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
right.
well,
i
mean,
it's
important
to
understand
the
constitutional
question
first
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases
in
order
to
make
sure
that
the
--
that
the
law
continues
to
elaborate
that
potentially
meritorious
constitutional
rights
are--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--well,
that
would
take
us
to
back
before
saucier,
the
court
--
it's
a
recent
decision
that
hasn't
been
proven
to
be
unworkable.
and
in
fact--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--well,
it
depends
on
your
view
of
necessity.
in
some
cases
certainly,
it
won't
really
come
up
in
other
contexts
and
the
law
is
not
established
in
section
1983;
it
may
never
be
established.
but
here
we
are
talking
about
a
question
where
there
is
a
circuit
split
and
the
court
definitely
should
provide
guidance
to
the
lower
courts.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--well,
this
court
has
looked
to
controlling
--
its
own
precedents
and
controlling
circuit
law
to
decide
what
is
--
what
law
is
clearly
established,
and
here,
payton
and
steagald
the
courts
held
that
there
is
a
bright-line
rule
that's
very
simple
for
police
officers,
it's
easy
for
them
to
understand.
if
they
would
like
to
enter
without
a
warrant
and
they
don't
have
exigent
circumstances
and
they
don't
have
consent,
then
it
is
presumptively
unconstitutional.
and
it's
a
good
rule
and
an
easy
rule
and
it's
also
why
this
is
not
a
difficult
constitutional
question.
there
are
no
exigent
circumstances
in
this
case,
and
no
reasonable
officer
could
conclude
that
the
presence
of
a
confidential
informant
in
the
house
means
there
is
consent
to
the
police
officer.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
well,
i
think
the
officers
in
the
tenth
circuit
need
to
be
aware
the
way
that
our
federal
court
system
works,
and
the
seventh
circuit
decision
isn't
binding
on
the
tenth
circuit.
and
with
all
due
respect
to
judge
posner,
he
dropped
ball
on
this
one.
he
says
this
--
this
is
a
the
case
where
--
it's
the
united
states
v
paul
--
there
are
no
exigent
circumstances;
the
officers
there
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
and
in
fact
should
have
gotten
a
warrant
but
he
said
it
was
justified
by
consent.
he's
saying
that
consent
to
one
person
is
consent
to
many.
and
this
court's
cases
have
said
that
consent
is
based
on
ordinary
social
expectation.
when
you
let
one
person
into
your
house,
you
just
don't
let
in
the
whole
world.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
yes.
i
think
certainly
an
officer
in
the
tenth
circuit
would
be
bound
to
follow
the
tenth
circuit
rule.
i
mean,
it's
not
irrelevant
that
other
--
that
other
courts
have
decided
it
differently,
but
to
the
extent
that
there
is
controlling
law
in
the
circuit,
i
think
that--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--well,
that
very
well
might
wind
up
in
this
court
if--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--well,
we
don't
expect
officers
to
survey
the
entire
case
law
and
come
up
with
a
law
professor's
view
of
whether
this
is
reasonable
or
not.
we
expect
them
to
follow
the
clearly
--
the
bright
lines
that
this
court
has
set
down
and
that
are
set
down
in
their
home
jurisdictions.
and
if
their
home
jurisdiction
says
it's
unconstitutional
it's
not
reasonable
for
them
to
follow
some
out-of-circuit
decision.
if,
for
instance,
the
seventh
circuit
had
said
that
a
warrantless
home
entry
is
okay
so
long
as
the
officer
had
breakfast
in
the
last
half-hour,
that's
an
unreasonable
rule,
and
it
wouldn't
be
reasonable
for
any
officer
to
follow
that.
and
the
facts
here
are
about
as
relevant
to
consent
as
to
whether
there
was
--
the
officer
had
breakfast
that
morning.
so
the
officers
here
are
not
entitled
to
qualify
--
nor
can
they
rely
on
the
seventh
circuit.
the
petitioners
have
not
given
you
any
reason
to
adopt
a
new
exception
here.
they
say
this
is
based
on
a
waiver
theory
or
that
it's
a
private
search
or
that
it
is
incident
to
arrest.
but
all
of
those
ignore
the
substantial
interest
in
the
sanctity
of
the
home.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
other
than
the
seventh
circuit?
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
the
--
one
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
there
was
both
a
confidential
informant
and
a
police
officer
were
admitted.
and
then
there's
a
later
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
that
did
say
this
is
okay
for
it,
which
came
after
this
case.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
actually
we
have
cited
three
circuits
where
these
same
facts
happened.
in
the
eighth
circuit,
the
first
circuit
and
the
eleventh
circuit.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
well,
no.
the
court
looked
to
whether
there
were
exigent
circumstances
or
consent.
the
courts
followed
this
court's
decision
in
payton
and
bramble
and
that
line
of
cases.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
i
think
the
appropriate
level
of
generality
is
that
the
facts
under
the
court
--
the
court
has
covered
the
field
when
it
comes
to
warrantless
home
entries.
if
you
have
a
warrant,
you
are
okay.
if
you
have
exigent
circumstances,
you
are
okay.
and
if
you
have
consent,
you
are
okay.
everything
else
is
presumptively
unconstitutional.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
that's
a
good
question.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
well,
the
court's
language
is
presumptively
unconstitutional
has
said
that
many
times.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
yes.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
yes.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
well,
our
position
is
that
would
be
--
the
additional
officer
entry
would
violate
the
constitution--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--yes.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
well,
to
the
extent
that
they
have
created
an
officer
safety
problem,
obviously
the
officers
are
going
to
go
in
to
help
him,
no
one
is
going
to
get
hurt.
but
the
additional
officer's
entry
can
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
no,
of
course,
they
can
send
assistance.
and
they
probably--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--yes,
they
have,
which
is
why
the
additional
officer's
entry
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
there
might
be
limited--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--yes,
my
answer
was
as
a
practical
matter
no
--
no
police
officer
is
going
to
leave,
even
if--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--he
very
well
may
get
sued
and
there
are
questions
of
fact
as
to--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--well,
i
disagree
that
the
officer
could
be
in
danger--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--they
did
create
the
exigent
circumstance--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--even
if
--
even
if
you
disagree
with
me
on
that,
it
shouldn't
make
any
difference
in
this
case
where
there
was
no
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
okay.
well,
the
general
--
never
mind--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--i
don't
think
you
would
need
to
to
write
the
opinion
that
would
say
that,
because
exigent
circumstances
are
not
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
well,
if
you
are
to
adopt
that
sort
of
--
i
think
you
certainly
could
adopt
that
rationale.
but
i
don't
think
the
way
to
get
there
is
through
a
waiver,
because
real
there's
nothing
that
the
person
--
the
suspect
has
done
that
he
knows
about
that
would
mean
that
he
waived
the
expectation
that
additional
people
would
come
in.
there
might
be--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--again,
i
don't
think
that
the
way
to
get
there
is
through
consent.
if
you
want
it
to
balance
and
say,
well,
the
government
has
an
agent
in
there
who
is
making
the
arrest
and
there
is
safety
concerns
and
other
reasons
why
we
would
want
to
do
that,
that
might
be
one
way
to
get
there.
i
don't
think
it's
through
consent.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
yes.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
that
would
be
--
that
would
certainly
be
a
basis
to
allow
for
police
officers.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
no,
i
think
they
do
have
probable
cause.
but
in
payton,
the
court
said
that
police
officers
who
are
outside
who
have
probable
cause
need
more
than
probable
cause
to
get
inside.
they
need
a
warrant,
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
you
certainly
could--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--you
certainly
could
adopt
that
rule,
and
that
would
be
a
--
an
additional
reason
for
police
to
enter
beyond
what
has
been
thus
far
established
by
this
court.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
i
don't
think
his
employment
status
is
--
is
what
is
at
issue.
the
question
is
whether
he
is
an
agent
of
the
state
for
the
purpose
that
he
is
inside
--
for
the
purposes
of
making
an
arrest
of
the
person
inside
the
home.
here
the
confidential
informant,
all
he
is
really
doing
is
acting
as
a
surveillance
device.
he
is
telling
the
officers
outside
what
is
happening
inside.
and
he
gives
them
probable
cause.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
he
might
be
an
agent
for
some
purposes
but
he
is
not
an
agent
for
purposes
of
making
an
arrest
inside,
which
is
what
they
want
to
do.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
if
there
was
some
assist
to
making
an
arrest
--
of
the
government,
then
assuming
we
are
following
justice
souter's
new
exception,
then
i
think
that
they
would
fall
into
that
exception.
but
here,
of
course,
the
confidential
informant
is
no
such
thing.
this
confidential
informant
was
not
acting
for
the
police.
he
wasn't
making
an
arrest.
there
was
no--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--well,
that's
true.
he
was
acting
with
the
police
but
he
wasn't
acting
for
the
police.
and
nothing
that
the
--
that
the
confidential
informant
did
inside,
even
if
attributed
to
the
police,
would
give
police
the
right
to
cross
that
threshold.
if
this
confidential
informant
were
a
police
officer,
i
think
you
would
have
to
base
it
on
the
power
of
the
police
to
make
the
arrest
inside,
the
power
of
the
state
to
make
that--
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
both
the
solicitor
general
and
the
petitioners
agree
that
confidential
informants
should
not
and
would
not
be
making
these
arrests.
so
the
function
of
the
confidential
informant
is
really
as
i
said,
just
a
surveillance
device;
and
what
is
important
is
not
what
he
is
doing
but
what
the
police
are
doing
who
are
outside.
mr.
theodore
p.
metzler
jr.
but
i
think
in
general
we
are
talking
about
a
very
small
category
of
cases
like
this
one
where
their
--
the
criminal
defendant
won
on
the
fourth
amendment
and
then
the
police
bring
up
some
new
argument
on
a
qualified
immunity
defense
because
there
would
already
be
some
law
on
the
questions
that
were
decided
in
the
--
in
the
criminal
case.
so
in
those
limited
circumstances
it
seems
to
put
too
much
of
a
thumb
on
the
scale
on
the
side
of
police
that
says
well,
you
can
come
up
with
a
new
theory
and
you
don't
even
have
to
show
that
it
applies;
all
you
have
to
show
is
that
nobody
has
ever
rejected
your
theory
and
then
it
is
not
fairly
established.
i
don't
think
in
that
small
number
of
cases
that
the
balance
should
really
tilt
that
far
towards
police.
and
here,
here
it's
certainly
not,
where
the
solicitor
general
and
the
petitioners
both
agree
that
the
court
should
decide
both
questions.
the
constitutional
question
here
is
not
very
difficult.
it
boils
down
to,
in
the
absence
of
exigent
circumstances,
could
any
reasonable
officer
have
believed
that
the
two
circumstances
they
would
like
to
see
in
previous
cases
--
that
is,
that
a
confidential
informant
is
inside,
and
that
he
sends
a
signal
out
that
there
is
probable
cause
--
do
those
make
any
difference
whatsoever
to
the
calculation
of
whether
there
are
exigent
circumstances
or
consent?
the
answer
is
no
and
no
reasonable
officer
could
have
believed
otherwise.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
