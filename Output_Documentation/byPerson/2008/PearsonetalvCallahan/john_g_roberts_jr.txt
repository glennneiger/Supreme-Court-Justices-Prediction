chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-751,
pearson
v.
callahan.
mr.
stirba.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
because
the
fourth
amendment
principle
of
consent
was
well
established?
in
other
words,
if
a
police
officer
goes
to
the
door
and
says
"may
i
come
in",
that
is
--
that
is
perfectly
acceptable.
is
that
--
that
the
level
of
generality
that
you
think
we
ought
to
analyze
this
issue
at?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
in
every
--
given
the
posture
of
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
case
on
the
underlying
constitutional
question,
you
do
not
have
to
prove
that
you
are
right;
isn't
that
correct?
you
have
to
establish
that
the
contrary
principle
is
not
clearly
established?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
it
--
why
isn't
it
an
advisory
opinion,
if
we
do
not
have
to
decide
--
to
decide
the
ultimate
question
whether
this
is
constitutional
or
not,
but
simply
whether
or
not
it
was
clearly
established
whether
it
was
unconstitutional?
why
isn't
it
purely
an
advisory
opinion
to
say
whether
it's
constitutional
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
those
are
different
grounds,
it
seems
to
me.
those
are
two
independent,
as
you
said.
here
it's
kind
of
a
--
it's
a
progression.
you
first
ask,
either,
under
somebody's
view,
i
guess,
saucier,
whether
or
not
it's
constitutional
or
not
and
then
whether
it's
clearly
established.
i
just
don't
know
why
the
first
question
isn't
purely
advisory,
because
you
don't
have
to
know
whether
it's
constitutional
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
metzler?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
--
was
mr.
stewart
correct
that
you
concede
that
if
this
person
entering
the
house
were
in
fact
a
police
officer,
that
this
would
have
been
okay?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
tough
--
at
least
i
find
it
a
very
difficult
question.
i
do
not
find
it
necessarily
a
terribly
difficult
question
whether
that
--
whatever
the
answer
is
--
whether
it
was
clearly
established,
precisely
because
i
find
the
underlying
questions
difficult.
so
you
have
a
handful
court
of
appeals
decisions,
you
have
got
a
factual
variation;
the
issue
is
whether
to
extend
the
police
coming
in
to
a
confidential
informant,
all
of
those
questions
are
very
difficult;
but
precisely
because
they
are,
it
doesn't
seem
that
the
rule,
whichever
rule
is
adopted,
is
clearly
established.
why
don't
--
and
yet
if
i
were
on
the
lower
court
of
appeals,
you
would
say
--
or
saucier
would
say,
i
have
got
to
decide
that
very
difficult
constitutional
question
and
then
decide
what's
a
very
easy
qualified
immunity
question.
does
that
--
why
does
that
make
sense?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know
you
don't
because
you
are
arguing
one
side
of
it.
[laughter]
but
concede
for
purposes
of
argument
that
it
is
a
difficult
question.
why
don't
we
just
tell
the
lower
courts
--
we
do
it,
we
go
right
ahead
to
the
qualified
immunity
question
by
not
granting
cert
on
one.
why
shouldn't
the
lower
courts
have
the
same
luxury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why,
because
we
need
to
provide
guidance
on
that
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
it
can't
come
up
any
other
way?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
a
--
or
a
suit
against
the
political
subdivision,
right?
you
could
have
sued
some
other
political
entity
other
than
the
officers
individually,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that
was
my
question.
there
are
other
ways
for
the
law
to
develop.
the
issue
can
come
up
on
merits
in
the
suit
against
the
municipality
which
doesn't
raise
the
qualified
immunity
question.
if
you
come
up
--
if
you
have
a
search
where
a
person
sues
to
get
whatever
was
seized
back.
you
know,
if
there's
a
--
and
also
the
option
is,
if
the
question
of
which
order
want
to
proceed
is
optional,
the
law
can
develop
if
the
courts
for
good
and
sufficient
reason
decide
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
first.
i
--
i'm
just
wondering
what
benefit
there
is
in
an
absolute
rigid
rule
that
courts
of
appeals
--
i
had
a
few
of
these
cases
in
courts
of
appeals;
i
thought
it
was
very
odd
that
i
had
to
go
and
decide
a
difficult
constitutional
issue
and
then
not
worry
about
it
because
in
one
sentence
you
say
well,
but
the
issue
is
not
clearly
established
and
so
it's
qualified
immunity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
my
point
though
is
that
at
least
in
my
experience
it
was
unworkable,
or
at
least
frustrating,
in
that
we
had
to
decide
not
just
a
factual
question
but
a
constitutional
question
in
a
context
where
it
wasn't
necessary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
the
fact
that
there
is
a
circuit
split
almost
by
definition
mean
that
it's
not
clearly
established?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
tenth
circuit
says
this
is
not
allowed,
and
every
other
circuit
since
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
has
held
that
it
is,
is
that
clearly
established
that
it's
not
allowed
in
the
tenth
circuit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
it
is
irrelevant.
then
it
is
irrelevant
that
ten
other
circuits
have
decided
it
differently.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
right,
but
do
the
police
officers
get
to
decide
that?
do
they
get
to
decide
that
not
only
judge
posner
thinks
this,
but
ten
other
circuits
think
this,
and
it
has
been
five
years
since
the
tenth
circuit.
i
mean,
do
they
have
to
go
through
that
type
of
analysis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
any
of
the
other
cases
involve
--
the
other
circuit
cases
involve
confidential
informants
as
opposed
to
police
officers?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
at
the
time
every
circuit
other
than
the
--
you
know,
if
there
is
a
police
officer
and
a
confidential
informant,
i
think
that
could
be
considered
a
police
officer
because
he
is
going
to
call
the
police
in
--
every
court
of
appeals
decision
involving
a
confidential
informant
said
it
was
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
in
those
circuits,
did
the
court
focus
on
the
distinction
between
the
police
officer
and
the
confidential
informant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
believe
that
--
what
is
the
appropriate
level
of
generality
to
look
at
in
addressing
this
question,
a
case
involving
a
confidential
informant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
it
that
the
issue
hasn't
come
up,
this
question
of
a
confidential
informant
is
one
that
hasn't
come
up?
why
would
we
say
that
is
presumptively
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
then
he
is
going
to
get
sued.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
decide
whether
the
confidential
informant
should
be
considered
an
employee
of
the
police?
let's
say
this
is
the
tenth
undercover
operation
he
has
engaged
in.
they
give
him
$100
after
every
undercover
operation.
i
mean,
is
he
an
employee
of
the
police
department?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
make
him
an
agent
of
the
police?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
wasn't
acting
on
his
own.
he
was
acting
for
the
police.
he
didn't
decide
i'm
going
to
do
this
and
--
because
you
know,
i
want
to
do
it,
and
it
just
so
happens
the
police
are
involved
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stirba,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
