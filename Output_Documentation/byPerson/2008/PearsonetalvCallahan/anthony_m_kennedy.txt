justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know,
and
it
gets
back
to
the
merits
and
not
saucier.
we
are
going
through
two
different
things
here.
assume
this
is
an
undercover
officer,
not
an
--
not
a
--
not
an
informant.
now,
the
undercover
officer
sees
a
crime
being
committed,
and
he
is
ready
to
make
the
arrest.
can
he
automatically
ask
for
police
assistance
and
--
and
other
policemen?
are
the
police
then
entitled
to
come
into
the
home
in
your
view,
or
do
there
have
to
be
some
exigent
circumstances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
--
just
to
be
clear,
if
--
if
i
may,
i
know
your
red
light
is
on:
your
position
is
if
an
undercover
officer
is
in
the
premises
and
sees
a
crime
being
committed,
he
automatically
can
invite
police
in
to
assist
him
in
making
an
arrest
without
exigent
circumstances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
--
what
do
i
read?
what
authority
do
you
cite
me
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
would
agree
he
could
make
the
--
the
arrest
by
himself.
assuming
he
was
a
police
officer--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--he
could
make
the
arrest
by
himself.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
and
--
but
you
are
saying
he
can't
ask
for
assistance
to
make
that
arrest
effective
in
all
cases.
there
has
to
be
some
exigent
circumstance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
case
that
justice
alito
put,
that
there
are
exigent
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
--
that's
a
different
point
and
i
have
some
question
about
that.
it
seems
to
me
the
police
are
never
quite
sure
exactly
what's
going
to
happen.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
an
area
where
the
police
do
need
guidance,
and
i
need
guidance.
i
find
this
--
i
find
this
very
difficult.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
could
have
learned
a
lot
if
the
--
if
the
courts
of
appeals
had
addressed
this
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
is
what
they
do
in
saucier.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
is
what
they
would
do
under
saucier.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
police
say,
you
know,
we
made
a
mistake.
we
should
have
had
a
warrant,
but
we
have
our
man
in
there
now,
we
have
got
to
do
something.
the
police
cannot
send
assistance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
you
say
they
have
created
the
exigent
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
--
so
my
first
statement
was
correct.
it's
illegal
for
the
police
to
send
their
assistance,
the
other
officers
in?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
say
as
a
practical
matter
we
have
to
say
that
under
the
constitution
we
can
endanger
--
we
must
endanger
the
officer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
the
hypothetical
is
that
they
have
to
send
people
in
to
assist
him.
but
the
hypothetical
also
is
they
should
have
anticipated
this,
and
therefore,
in
your
words,
they
created
exigent
circumstances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
dilemma
and
that
paradox
casts
considerable
doubt
on
your
proposition
that
if
the
police
create
the
exigent
circumstances,
they
cannot
rely
on
it.
i
seriously
question
that
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
i
want
to
talk
about
the
general
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
saying
that
any
time
police
create
the
exigent
circumstances,
they
can't
rely
on
them
if
they
had
had
the
time
to
get
a
warrant.
and
i
find
that
a
dangerous
rule.
