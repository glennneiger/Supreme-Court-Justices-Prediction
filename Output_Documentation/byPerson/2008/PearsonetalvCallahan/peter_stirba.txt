mr.
peter
stirba
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
in
this
case
there
were
three
different
federal
circuits
and
two
state
courts
that
established
it
was
constitutionally
permissible
for
police
officers
to
enter
a
home
without
a
warrant
as
a
follow-up
entry
to
effectuate
arrest
after
an
illegal
drug
transaction
when
a
government
agent
had
occurred
and
probable
cause
had
been
established.
although
the
rule
has
become
known
as
the
doctrine
of
consent
once
removed,
and
the
lower
courts
have
banned
various
rationales
in
support
of
the
rule,
the
name
or
label
is
not
important.
what
is
important
is
that
the
rule
is
predicated
upon
well
recognized
fourth
amendment
principles,
and
that
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
the
consent
doctrine
was
well
established
in
the
lower
courts
as
settled
fourth
amendment
law.
thus,
irrespective
of
how
this
court
rules
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
rule
itself,
the
petitioner
officers
could
have
reasonably
believed
that
what
they
were
doing
was
lawful.
mr.
peter
stirba
no,
certainly
we
think
that
the
generality
of
just
pure
consent
is
not
the
level
at
which
it
should
be
determined.
in
fact,
that
was
the
problem
with
the
tenth
circuit
case.
but
it
has
to
be
--
the
right
has
to
be
defined
in
a
specific
clear
way,
and
it
has
to
be
--
the
contours
of
the
right
have
to
be
sufficiently
clear
that
police
officers
know
that
when
they
engage
in
the
conduct,
they
know
what
they
they're
doing
is
unlawful.
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
all
of
the
law
that
was
in
existing
at
the
time
of
the
entry
was
supportive
of
exactly
what
the
police
officers
did.
mr.
peter
stirba
justice
souter,
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
contending
this
is
an
implied
consent
case,
although
that
has
been
a
theory
that
has
been
advanced
in
the
lower
courts.
we
believe
that
the
way
that
this
was
constitutionally
lawful
--
this
is
really
a
lewis
case,
and
that
is
once
you
engage
in
some
illegal
conduct
with
a
government
agent
in
your
home,
you
have
waived
any
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
peter
stirba
absolutely.
and
we
do
--
and
we
think--
mr.
peter
stirba
--there
are
two
points,
justice
souter.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
lawfulness
of
the
confidential--
mr.
peter
stirba
--no,
your
honor.
there
actually
--
there
were
actually
three
out
of
the
seventh
circuit,
the
pollard
case
out
of
the
sixth
circuit,
which
involved
a
police
officer
and
a
confidential
informant--
mr.
peter
stirba
--that
is
a
circuit
case.
mr.
peter
stirba
that
was
a
circuit
court
case,
u.s.
v.
pollard.
mr.
peter
stirba
there
were
three
out
of
the
seventh
circuit.
paul,
diaz,
and
i
think
it's
aziano
were
all
confidential
information
cases
where
the
courts
ruled
squarely
that
there
was
no
difference
between
a
confidential
informant
and
a
police
officer.
mr.
peter
stirba
yes,
your
honor.
the
pollard
case
involved
a
confidential
informant--
mr.
peter
stirba
--sixth
circuit.
mr.
peter
stirba
and
they
cited
in
support
the
confidential
informant
cases
from
the
seventh
circuit.
we
also
read
gramble
--
this
is
a
2000
--
i'm
sorry,
a
995
ninth
circuit
case
which
talked
about
a
government
agent,
it
did
not
draw
a
distinction
between
a
confidential
informant
and
a
police
officer
--
as
supportive
as
well.
that's
exactly
what
judge
kelly
determined
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
tenth
circuit.
mr.
peter
stirba
well,
fundamentally
--
and
of
course
the
test
for
fourth
amendments
purposes
is
the
skinner
test
--
that
once
you
are
a
government
agent
or
a
government
actor,
there
really
is
no
material
difference
in
terms
what
the
confidential
informant
would
do
or
the
undercover
police
officer
would
do.
mr.
peter
stirba
two
points.
in
our
reply
brief,
pages
6
and
7,
we
point
out
the
wide
variety
of
confidential
informants.
they
come
in
many
different
shapes
and
sizes.
mr.
peter
stirba
this
one
clearly
had
a
drug
problem.
this
one
also
attended
college.
this
one
also
was
a
star
athlete
in
high
school,
and
this
one
also
was
reliable
in
a
previous
drug
transaction.
moreover--
mr.
peter
stirba
--well,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
once
again,
he
is
a
government
actor.
for
purposes
of
fourth
amendment
liability
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
a
police
officer
or
a
confidential
informant,
as
long
as
he
is
an
agent
of
the
government,
which
clearly
he
was.
he
was
a
government
actor--
mr.
peter
stirba
--well,
as
a
general
proposition,
justice
souter,
you
can't
make
that
kind
of
determination.
we
point
out--
mr.
peter
stirba
--because
sometimes
confidential
informants
are
retired
police
officers;
sometimes
confidential
informants
are
police
cadets.
sometimes
confidential
informants--
mr.
peter
stirba
--i
wouldn't
want
to
make
that
statement.
i
don't
know
that
it's
material,
though,
to
the
analysis
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
whether
or
not,
once
you
are
a
government
agent
or
a
government
actor,
there
really
is
no
legal
significance
that
flows
from
that
to
draw
a
distinction
between
one
who
is
actually
employed
by
the
police,
taking
a
paycheck
from
the
police,
and
one
who
is
not.
mr.
peter
stirba
well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
officers
testified
why
they
didn't
get
a
warrant,
244-245
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
256
and
257.
two
problems:
one,
they
weren't
sure
the
drugs
were
going
to
be
there.
these
are
small
amounts
of
drugs
in
a
rural
area;
they
dissipate
very
quickly.
mr.
peter
stirba
i
am
only
going
on
the
record
and
what
these
informed
officers
testified
to.
mr.
peter
stirba
well,
it
is.
in
essence
we
are
talking
about
an
anticipatory
warrant,
and
under
u.s.
v.
grubbs
you
not
only
need
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
drugs
will
be
there--
mr.
peter
stirba
--justice
--
justice
souter,
i
don't
believe
at
the
time,
approximately
9
o'clock
in
the
evening,
the
police
had
probable
cause
to
believe
the
drugs
were
there.
mr.
peter
stirba
at
the
time
of
9
o'clock,
i
don't
think
it
was
established
that
there
were
drugs--
mr.
peter
stirba
--he
never
told
the
police
that.
and
the
purpose--
mr.
peter
stirba
--the
purpose
of
the
operation,
of
course,
was
to
establish
that
there
was
in
fact
drugs
in
the
house.
the
transaction
would
occur
and
that
would
conclusively
establish
probable
cause.
i
don't
think
we
should
fault
the
police
for
essentially
being
careful
before
they
entered
the
home
to
make
sure
that
in
fact
they
had
probable
cause.
mr.
peter
stirba
well,
as
i
--
as
i
explained
before,
they
believed
the
drugs
in--
mr.
peter
stirba
--we
don't
believe
they
did,
your
honor.
and
we
don't
believe
they
could
have
gotten
a--
mr.
peter
stirba
--an
anticipatory
warrant.
mr.
peter
stirba
well,
the
record
evidence
doesn't
substantiate
that,
or
they
would
have
gotten--
mr.
peter
stirba
--or
they
would
have
gotten
a
warrant.
mr.
peter
stirba
because
the
police
did
not
believe
that
at
the
time
that
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant,
that
the
drugs
would
not
have
been
dissipated.
and
they
--
as
they
testified--
mr.
peter
stirba
--pardon
me?
mr.
peter
stirba
here's
another
point.
that
is
just
an
option,
justice
souter,
the
police
--
if
you
believed
the
police
could
get
a
warrant.
they
didn't
have
to
get
a
warrant.
they
obviously
were
engaged
in
a
buy/bust
operation,
which
eventually
led
to
them
to
the
particular
position
where
they
clearly
established
probable
cause.
mr.
peter
stirba
in
rural
utah
--
and
this
is
page
47
of
the
joint
appendix
--
the
officers
testified
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
need
to
use
confidential
informants
is
because
the
police
are
all
known.
and,
therefore,
if
they're
going
to
engage
in
any
drug--
mr.
peter
stirba
--well,
i
don't
know
how
i
can
answer
the
question
any
more
than
i
have,
justice
souter.
mr.
peter
stirba
they
--
they
chose
not
to,
for
reasons
they
didn't
believe
they
had
probable
cause
and
they
were
concerned
that
the
drugs
had
been
dissipated.
mr.
peter
stirba
that's
correct.
and
the
law
at
the
time
that
these
officers
engaged
in
this
operation,
entered
the
home
--
and
once
again,
it
was
based
upon
probable
cause
--
supported
in
fact
constitutionally
what
they
did,
and
that
it
was
indeed
permissible.
and
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
we
believe,
irrespective
of
how
the
court
views
whether
they
should
or
should
not
have
gotten
a
warrant
and
the
constitutional
implications
of
that,
that
the
law
was
clearly
not
established
sufficiently
such
that
these
officers
were
entitled
to
qualified
immunity.
that
was
one
of
the
problems
with
the
tenth
circuit
case.
they--
mr.
peter
stirba
--that's
true.
on
the
criminal
appeal,
the
state
did
not
argue
lewis,
did
not
argue
consent
once
removed.
and
that
is
part
of
the
problem
with
a
number
of
cases
that
have
been
cited
by
the
respondent.
they
are
exigent
circumstances
cases
where
the
consent
once
removed
doctrine
of
lewis
isn't
even
advocated
or
litigated.
we
think
that's
very
important.
unless
the
justices
have
any
other
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
peter
stirba
thank
you.
mr.
peter
stirba
the
colloquy
about
the
safety
concerns
when
the
officer
or
the
confidential
informer
are
in
the
home
i
think
highlight
why
the
distinction
between
a
confidential
informant
and
the
officer
really
doesn't
make
much
meaningful
headway
in
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment.
obviously
if
the
police
officer
was
acting
under
cover
in
this
particular
situation
he
would
not
have
announced
--
there
were
three
arrestees
who
were
actually
in
the
premises
at
the
time
of
the
follow-up
entry.
he
would
not
have
said
after
the
drug
transaction
occurred
"oh,
by
the
way,
i'm
a
police
officer,
i'm
here
to
arrest
you.
"
for
obvious
reasons
connoting
safety
and
other
issues
which
would
have
been
attendant
to
them.
similarly
the
confidential
informant
isn't
going
to
do
that,
either,
for
the
same
particular
problem,
even
if
the
confidential
informant
had
arrested
powers
under
state
law.
the
issue
is
the
police
officer
can
call
up
for
backup
and
assistance
to
effectuate
arrest,
which
is
specifically
what
occurred
here.
similarly,
there
is
no
really
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
a
confidential
informant
as
a
government
actor
allowing
for
the
additional
entry
or
follow-up
entry
of
additional
officers
for
backup
and
assistance
to
make
sure
the
arrest
is
safe
and
secure
than
if
you
have
a
police
officer.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
the
first
time
any
federal
circuit
drew
this
distinction
between
a
confidential
informant
and
a
police
officer
was
the
tenth
circuit
decision.
they
adopted
consent
once
removed.
they
just
limited
it
to
a
police
officer.
obviously
the
police
officers
involved
in
this
case
could
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
anticipate
such
a
distinction
being
drawn,
especially
given
the
fact
that
there
was
at
least
a
seventh
circuit
body
of
law,
the
sixth
circuit
body
of
law,
and
as
we
argue,
which
we
think
is
a
fair
reading
of
gramble
--
because
they
cite
the
seventh
circuit
body
of
law
that
includes
the
confidential
informant
--
there
were
at
least
three
circuits
that
rejected
that
distinction,
and
you
in
2000
confirmed
that
in
the
sixth
circuit
there
is
no
distinction
as
a
matter
of
this
particular
doctrine
between
a
confidential
informant
and
a
police
officer.
and
finally
with
respect
to
the
exigent
circumstances
cases,
and
you
can
look
at
any
one
that
was
cited
by
the
respondent,
there
is
no
mention
of
lewis,
there
is
no
mention
of
consent
once
removed,
there
is
no
mention
of
any
abrogation
of
privacy.
those
issues
were
not
raised,
just
like
the
issues
were
not
raised
in
the
criminal
appeal
of
mr.
callahan's
conviction;
and
so
therefore
they
are
really
not
relevant,
they
are
not
probative,
and
we
are
not
suggesting
this
is
an
exigent
circumstances
case,
nor
are
we
suggest
relying
on
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment
issue
any
implied
consent.
we
have
rested
our
--
the
justification
for
the
fourth
amendment
issue
on
search
incident
and
also
the
lewis
doctrine
because
we
think
this
is
a
lewis
case.
thank
you.
