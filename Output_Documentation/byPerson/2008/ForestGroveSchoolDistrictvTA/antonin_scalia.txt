of
course,
(ii)
through
(iv)
don't
--
don't
limit
or
contradict
any
explicit
requirement
of
(i).
justice
antonin
scalia
(i)
is
only
at
most
a
negative
implication,
which
--
which
one
would
not
draw
in
light
of
(ii)
through
(iv),
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
parents
here
didn't
--
didn't
run
off
to
a
private
school
only
after
the
school
district
had
found
that
their
child
didn't
require
any
special
education,
did
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
--
they
put
him
in
a
private
school
without
even
consulting
the
schools.
justice
antonin
scalia
saying
by
the
way,
we
can
get
some
money.
how
much
--
how
much
money
are
you
talking
about
imposing
on
the
school
district
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
month?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
school
does
not
have
to
come
up
with
an
iep.
it
could
tough
it
out
and
say,
we're
going
to
rest
on
our
belief
that
this
child
does
not
need
any
special
education,
right?
and
unless
the
school
proposes
an
iep,
the
parent
cannot
come
within
subsection
(2)
by
sending
the
kid
to
get
the
special
services.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
the
district
appeal?
that's
the
end
of
the
road?
can't
the
district
say
the
hearing
officer
is
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
it
does,
does
it
have
to
take
any
action
in
the
interim.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
you
be
surprised
to
find
a
court
decision
which
says
that
when
the
reason
that
the
plaintiff
cannot
comply
with
the
requirement
that
he
first
be
in
a
plan,
when
the
reason
is
--
is
the
district's
refusal
to
abide
by
an
order
to
prepare
a
plan,
that
subsection
(2)
does
not
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
profit
by
your
own
malfeasance.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
--
you
don't
think
--
you
don't
think
a
court
could
say
the
only
reason
these
people
could
not
comply
with
(ii)
is
that
the
school
district
made
it
impossible
by
not
complying
with
the
order
to
provide
an
iep;
and,
therefore,
they
--
they
can
recover
for
the
private
placement?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
more
than
conceivable.
i
know
a
lot
of
courts
that
would
hold
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
you
are
reading
(c)(i)
to
say
something
that
it
doesn't
say.
it
just
says
you
don't
have
to
pay
if
the
agency
has
made
a
free
appropriate
public
education
available.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
read
it
to
say
you
must
pay
whenever
it
hasn't
made,
and
it
just
doesn't
say
that.
it
--
it's
a
safe
harbor
for
the
school
district.
it
says,
so
long
as
you've
made
an
appropriate
public
education
available,
you
can't
be
liable
for
any
--
any
private
school
tuition.
now,
you
want
to
expand
that
to
say,
and
whenever
that
condition
doesn't
exist,
you
are
liable.
but
it
really
doesn't
say
that.
and
--
and
the
later
sections
suggest
that
it
meant
not
to
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
if
--
if
you
avoid
that
collaborative
relationship
entirely
and
just
run
off
to
a
prior
--
to
a
private
school
right
away,
you
get
reimbursement.
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
congress
--
huh?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
following
this.
i
don't
know
what
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
any
of
these
other
procedures
--
i
took
these
to
be
procedures
that
have
to
be
provided
by
the
school
district,
not
--
not
by
the
hearing
officer.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
say
hearing
officers.
"an
opportunity
to
present
complaints
with
respect
to
any
matter
relating
to
the
identification--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
present
the
complaint
to
the
principal.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
might
make
also
sense
to
say
that
if
the
hearing
officer
has
no
authority
to
award
a
certain
type
of
relief,
neither
does
a
court,
under
that
general
provision
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
right,
but
--
but
with
these
new
provisions,
if
the
hearing
officer
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
award
the
kind
of
relief
that
was
awarded
here,
then
the
court
wouldn't
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
agree
they
go,
as
we
say,
in
pari
passu--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
--
that
whatever
the
hearing
officer
can
do,
the
court
can
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
whatever
he
can't
do,
the
court
can't
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
(i)(2)(b)(iii)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--(i)(2)(b)(iii)?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
now
(c)?
justice
antonin
scalia
(c)(iii).
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
be
clear.
am
i
correct
that
under
--
under
the
theory
of
the
statute
that
you
are
supporting,
it
would
be
possible
for
a
parent,
without
first
consulting
with
the
school
at
all,
to
put
the
child
in
a
private
school
and
then
later
to
request
public
school
services,
and
when
it
is
--
when
they
are
denied
or
they
are
inadequate,
all
that
public
school
--
private
school
tuition
would
be
reimbursable?
