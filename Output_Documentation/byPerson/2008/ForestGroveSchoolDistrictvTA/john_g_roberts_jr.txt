chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
morning
we
will
first
hear
argument
in
case
08-305,
forest
grove
school
district
v.
t.a..
mr.
feinerman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
remember,
perhaps
incorrectly,
from
the
prior
argument
here
that
the
period
that
they
had
to
try
out
the
school
plan
was
ten
days?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
a
hard
and
fast
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
is
that
--
is
that
a
period
that
your
client's
prepared
to
accept?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--why
isn't
it
the
case
that
the
school's
diagnosis
is
a
related
service
under
the
statutory
provision?
it
seems
to
me
to
be
very
important
service
to
the
parents
to
know
what
the
school's
diagnosis
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
talking
about
what
the
parents
received.
and
they
receive
a
diagnosis,
and
the
statute
covers
--
asks
whether
they
previously
received
special
education
and
related
services.
diagnosis
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
service
related
to
special
education.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
salmons.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
wrong
with
ten
days?
i
mean
it's
--
it's
a
big
expense
you
are
asking
the
school
district
to
incur,
that
will
take
away
funds
from
other
programs.
and
all
--
all
they
are
saying
is
give
it
a
try
for
ten
days,
and
if
it
doesn't
work
out,
then
you
can
go?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
yes,
the
first
day
--
the
first
day
they
say,
look,
we
don't
think
this
is
going
to
work
out,
so
we
are
notifying
you
what
we
are
going
to
do.
and
they
say,
well,
you've
got
to
do
that
in
ten
days,
and
they
said,
okay,
ten
days.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
that's
right,
but
once
the
law
is
clarified,
schools
that
specialize
in
--
in
treating
these
kids
would
be
able
--
they
would
understand
as
well,
and
they
would
understand
you've
got
to
--
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
sending
--
most
of
the
people
who
will
be
sending
their
children
to
the
school
have
to
wait
ten
days.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
actual
practice
on
the
ground
would
work
out
pretty
easily.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
which
way
does
that
cut?
it
seems
to
me
that
cuts
the
other
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
here's
a
--
here's
a
new
plan.
we've
worked
on
it.
here
it
is.
at
least
give
it
ten
days
--
two
school
week
tries.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with
respect,
counsel,
what
congress
provided
is
that
the
child
must
have
previously
received
special
education
and
related
services.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
think
they
did
provide
that
you've
got
to
try
it
out
at
least
for
a
minimal
period.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
what
type
of
special
education
services
do
you
think
do
count
as
having
been
previously
received?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
reading
--
in
reading
it
that
way,
you
are
reading
the
phrase
"who
previously
received
special
education
services.
"
to
mean
also
who
previously
did
not
receive
special
education
services.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
so
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
previously
received
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
are
saying
congress
went
to
the
trouble
of
spelling
out
this
elaborate
provision
in
(c)(iii)
and
(ii)
and
all
the
other
things,
but
that
was
not
the
universe
of
the
situations
in
which
there
could
be
reimbursement?
they
went
to
that
trouble,
but
then
--
at
the
end
you
want
to
say
or
some
other
provisions
or
some
other
circumstances?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
for
10
days,
right?
even
assuming
the
bad
faith
that
you
are
ascribing
to
the
school
district,
it
would
only
work
for
10
days,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
then
they
would
have
--
then
they
would
have
previously
received
special
education
services,
and
they
could
proceed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
"stonewall"
sounds
to
me
like
bad
faith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
was
the
word
you
used.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
move
to
the
situation
where
they
have
a
plan
that
the
parents
regard
as
inadequate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
that
situation
all
they
would
have
to
do
is
to
have
the
child
try
the
plan
for
10
days.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
this
is
spending
clause
legislation.
do
you
have
any
rough
idea
of
how
much
of
the
obligation
incurred
by
the
states
is
reimbursed
by
the
federal
government?
what
percentage?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
this
interpretation
vastly
expands
the
liability
of
school
districts
in
that
particular
area,
isn't
that
a
consideration
we
should
consider?
since
they
accept
--
the
states
accept
10
percent
of
the
funds
to
incur
these
obligations
and
then
you
are
expanding
the
obligation
in
a
way
that
we
may
at
least
find
is
ambiguous,
isn't
that
a
pertinent
factor?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
feinerman,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
08-305,
forest
grove
school
district
versus
t.
