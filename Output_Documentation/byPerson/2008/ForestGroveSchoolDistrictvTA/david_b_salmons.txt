mr.
david
b.
salmons
that
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
school
district
in
this
case
improperly
denied
t.a.,
a
child
with
a
disability
who
had
always
been
enrolled
in
public
schools,
access
to
all
public
special
education
services.
it
asserts
that
because
its
wrong
eligibility
determinations
prevented
t.a.
from
receiving
special
education
services,
it
is
immune
from
reimbursing
t.a.'s
parents
the
cost
of
obtaining
those
services
from
another
source.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
think
there
are
several
problems
with
that
reading
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
ten-day
period
that
is
referenced
in
subsection
(c)(iii)
refers
to
the
amount
of
notice
that
a
district
needs
to
receive
before
a
child
is
removed
from
the
public
school
system.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
but
that's
--
that's
simply
not
the
way
these
things
work
as
a
general
matter,
and
let
me
just
point
out
a
few
things
about
the
normal
process
of
developing
iep's.
and,
again,
here
the
child
never
even
got
that
far.
but,
typically,
iep's
are
developed
at
the
end
of
the
--
of
a
school
year
for
the
following
year.
and
the
parents
at
that
point
have
a
period
of
time
in
which
to
decide
to
go
along
with
that
plan
or
to
give
notice
and
then
make
alternative
arrangements.
and
it's
simply
the
--
i
mean
--
and
that's
the
way
it
works,
because
it's
important
for
parents
to
be
able
to
get
their
child
in
an
alternative
program
if
they
decide
that's
what
they
want
to
do.
and
if
you
wait
until
the
school
year
has
already
started,
those
may
not
be
available.
and
the
ten-day
notice
requirement--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--but,
again,
your
honor,
if
you
focus
on
the
terms
of
the
statute,
the
--
even
under
petitioner's
reading,
the
requirement
would
be
to
have
previously
received
special
education
services,
not
to
have
tried
out
a
particular
plan.
it
may
be
the
case
that
the
plan
for
the
upcoming
year
is
--
is
very
different
than
the
plan
for
the
prior
year.
perhaps
they
have
had
another
assessment,
and
they
had
substantially
changed--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
i--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i
think
the
way
that
cuts,
your
honor,
is
--
is
that
that
reading
of
what
you
are
positing,
i
guess,
in
this
exchange
what
congress
might
have
had
in
mind,
is
not
what
they
said
in
the
statute.
they
did
not
require
parents
to
try
out
a
particular
plan;
just
that
at
some
point
in
time
they
had
previously
received
special
education
services.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
right.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
but
not
the
particular
plan
that
is
the
subject
of
the
iep,
your
honor.
that
--
that
connection
does
not
exist
in
the
statute.
and
--
and
we
think
it's
counter
to
what
congress
intended.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well
--
well,
if
i
--
if
i
may,
the
way
we
read
this
provision,
and
it's
set
forth
on
pages
3
and
4
on
the
addendum
to
the
blue
brief,
and
we
think
it's
important
that
we
read
this
as
a
whole
and
in
context,
is
that
subsection
(c)(i)
provides
the
general
rule
to
govern
the
payment
of
private
school
tuition
based
on
a
unilateral
placement
by
the
parents.
and
subsection
(c)(i)
creates
the
only
expressed
limitation
on
the
right
to
reimbursement,
and
it
does
so
only
in
instances
where
the
school
district
has
provided
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education.
we
think
subsection
(c)(ii),
(c)(iii),
and
(c)(iv)
work
together
to
govern
the
subset
of
cases
that
is
congress
was
most
concerned
about
and
that,
in
fact,
are
the
most
common
scenario
in
which
these
disputes
have
arised.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that
is
what--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
that's
where
we
part
company,
your
honor,
because,
in
fact,
that
negative
inference
that
you
refer
to
is
precisely
what
petitioners
attempt
to
read
into
subsection
(c)(ii).
there
is
nothing
in
subsection
(c)(ii)
that
provides
any
restriction
on
the
ability
to
obtain
reimbursement.
it
was
written
in
permissive
language.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no,
your
honor.
we
are
simply
not
reading
that
language
"who
previously
received"
to
be
a
condition
precedent.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
it
does
matter,
your
honor,
because
the
provisions
that
follow
in
(c)(iii)
and
(c)(iv)
that
guide
the
exercise
of
discretion,
in
that
category
of
cases
that
were
of
concern
to
congress,
only
apply
to
the
cases
that
are
defined
in
subsection
(c)(ii).
so
in
our
reading
the
language
(c)(iii)
and
(c)(iv).
it
does
not
serve--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
that's
right.
we
think
that
congress
was
focused
on
a
particular
set
of
cases
where
problems
had
arisen,
and
that's
where
you
already
had
a
child
in
the
process
of
receiving
special
education
and
you
had
parents
who
removed
the
child
out
of
that
process
without
giving
adequate
notice,
and
thereby
short
--
excuse
me
--
short-circuiting
an
ongoing
collaborative
relationship
that
congress
wanted
to
preserve.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well
you
don't
automatically
get
reimbursement.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
you
don't
--
you
don't
automatically
get
reimbursement,
your
honor.
there
is
just
no
categorical
bar
to
seeking
reimbursement.
you
still
have
to
show
it's
an
appropriate
remedy,
which
always
has
been
understood
to
require
a
showing
that
the
parents
acted
reasonably
and
in
good
faith,
and
that
they
were
sincere
in
their
efforts
to
obtain
services
from
the
school.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
the
alternative--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--this
is
what's
--
your
honor,
this
is
what's
known
as
the
child
find
provision.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
what
it
provides
is
that
for
--
let
me
just
step
back
for
a
moment
and
remind
the
court
that
the
obligation
on
the
state
is
to
ensure
that
children,
all
children
with
disabilities,
regardless
of
whether
they
are
in
public
or
private
school,
have
the
opportunity
for
a
free
appropriate
public
education.
with
respect
to
children
in
private
school
who
are
not
seeking
a
free
appropriate
public
school
education
from
the
public
school
district,
the
only
requirement
under
the
act
is
that
you
seek
them
out,
you
find
them,
you
identify
them,
and
that
you
report
that
to
the
department
of
education,
and
that
you
get
money
for
those
children.
and
for
those
children
who
are
not
enrolled
in
public
school,
you
have
to
use
a
percentage
of
the
funds
you
receive
from
the
federal
government--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--to
provide
benefits
that
are
available
to
all
children.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
it's
not
money
to
the
parents,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
it
funds
programs,
for
example
speech
therapy
or
something
like
that.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that
they
would
then
allow
children
in
private
school
to
--
to
benefit
from.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
it's
not
even
necessarily
money
that
goes
to
the
private
school.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
it
goes
to
the
public
schools,
that
they
provide
services
that
they
may
make
available
to
children
regardless
of
their
placement.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
not
--
i
would
not
describe
it
that
way,
your
honor,
if
i
--
i
don't
mean
to--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i
mean,
again,
just
keep
in
mind
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
is
a
child
who
was
in
the
public
school
system--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--okay.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
go
ahead.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
would
submit
that
the
way
we
read
the
statute,
your
honor,
in
fact,
does
precisely
that.
because,
the
school
district
--
just
again,
take
this--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--the
--
the
difficulty
i
have--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
the
difficulty
i
have
with
your
question,
your
honor,
is
that
the
school
district
always
has
a
shot
under
the
act.
in
this
case,
the
school
district
assessed
the
child
in
2001
and
again
in
2003,
and
both
times
it
erroneously
concluded
that
the
child--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no,
not
just
that
it's
reasonable,
but
in
the
process
of
assessing
the
child,
in
developing
an
individual
education
plan
that
is
appropriate
for
that
child,
that
is
precisely
the
shot
that
the
statute
gives
the
public
school
system
to
get
it
right.
what
the
statute
does--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
that
is
what
this
court
held
in
carter.
that's
what
the
regulations
say.
i
would
note
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
statute
and
the
provisions
that
petitioner
relies
on,
(c)(ii)
for
example,
that
makes
it
a
statutory
requirement
to
show
that
the
private
placement
is
reasonable
as
a
--
as
a
condition
precedent
to
obtain
tuition
reimbursement.
but
both
sides
concede
that
that's
required,
even
though
it's
not
in
the
statute.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
am
happy
to
answer
that
question.
but
petitioner
makes
this
a
centerpiece
of
their
reply
brief
and
i
think
they
just
misread
the
statute.
and
again,
keep
in
mind
that
these
amendments
in
1997
were
written
against
a
backdrop
of
this
longstanding
statute
and
this
court's
interpretations
of
it.
the
most
direct
place
where
the
statute
provides
hearing
officers
the
authority
to
hear
address
reimbursement
claims
and
to
award
reimbursement
--
and
this
is
on
page
9
of
the
addendum
in
the
blue
brief
--
is
1415(b)(6).
this
has
always
been
in
the
statute
and
it
states
that
the
parents
must
be
provided
an
opportunity
to
present
complaints
with
respect
to
"any
matter
relating
to
the
identification,
evaluation,
or
educational
placement
of
the
child,
or
the
provision
of
a
free
appropriate
public
education
to
such
child.
"
that
is
--
again,
that
has
always
been
understood
to
include
the
right
to
seek
reimbursement
before
the
hearing
officer.
and
this
court
in
burlington
cited
legislative
history
from
the
1975
act
that
noted
that
hearing
officers
could
award
reimbursement
and
address
such
claims
in
concluding
that
it
was
part
of
the
appropriate
relief
that
courts
ought
to
be
able
to
have
under
1415.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
these
are
--
these
are
required
--
this
whole
section,
your
honor,
1412,
is
entitled
"state
eligibility",
and
these
are
all
requirements
that
states
have
to
provide
for
process
in
order
to
obtain
funds
under
the
act,
and
so
it
is
a
requirement
that
states
provide
hearing
officers
that
have
the
ability
to
award
reimbursement--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--those
complaints--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no,
your
honor.
this
is
a
reference
to
the
due
process
complaint
notice
that
is
referenced
elsewhere
in
the
statute.
i
believe
petitioner
would
agree
with
me
that
that's
what
this
references.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
right.
but
keep
in
mind
that
the
judicial
review
process
that
the
statute
provides
--
and
this
is
at
page
17
of
the
addendum.
the
right
to
file
a
federal
action
is
limited
to
those
matters
that
are
raised
in
the
due
process
complaint
notice
filed
before
the
hearing
officer.
this
is
an
exhaustion
requirement.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that
has
not
been
the
interpretation
of
this
act,
your
honor,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
34
cfr
300.148(b),
which
is
a
regulation
that
states
that
hearing
officers
can
award
reimbursement
and
that
has
been
around
since
the
mid1980s.
my
point
is
that
is
--
the
congress
enacted
these
amendments
in
1997
against
a
subtle
understanding
of
how
this
act
works.
and
it's
always
been
understood
that
hearing
officers
can
award
reimbursement.
there
was
no
need
to
provide
in
the
'97
amendments
that
hearing
officers
can
also
award
relief.
and
again
because
it's
an
--
it's
an
exhaustion
requirement
and
the
judicial
review
provision
only
relates
to
the
things
that
you
have
raised
before
the
hearing
officer,
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
a
court
can
award
reimbursement
but
you
can't
get
reimbursement
from
the
hearing
officer.
that's
the
subject
of
the
review
of
the
federal
court
action.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
hearing
officers
have
always
been
permitted
to
award
reimbursement,
as
occurred
in
this
case,
and
then
the
school
district
can
decide
either
to
pay
that
or
to
seek
review
if
they
--
if
they
so
choose.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
but
of
course
this
court
in
burlington
held
the
court
did
have
that
authority
and
it
relied
on
the
fact
that
it
has
always
been
understood
that
hearing
officers
have
that
authority
in
reaching
that
conclusion
in
burlington.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
i
--
with
respect,
i
think
there
is
nothing
in
the
'97
amendments--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
i
do
think
that
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
say--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i
think
generally--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i
think
they
ought
to
be
read
together,
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
think
they
ought
to
be
read
to
provide
for
the
authority
to
provide
tuition
reimbursement.
one
statutory
point
i
would
like
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that
under
petitioner's
reading
of
the
act,
if
you
read
(c)(ii)
to
be
--
that
reference
to
(c)(i)
has
no
meaning
whatsoever.
it
does
not
work
under
the
act
at
all.
whereas
on
our
reading
of
the
statute,
(c)(ii)
still
does
work.
it's
not
a
precondition;
it
doesn't
do
the
work
that
petitioner
suggests;
it
does
a
more
limited
--
serve
a
more
limited
function,
but
it
still
serves
that
identifying
role
for
the
factors
congress
wanted
applied
when
it
was
focused
on
how
to
preserve
relationships,
ongoing
collaborative
relationships
through
the
iep
process
that
warrant
preservation.
one
other
point
i
make,
your
honor,
and
justice
scalia,
you
make
reference
to
this
principle
of
equity,
that
you
ought
not
be
allowed
to
prevent
something
from
happening
and
then
come
into
court
and
claim,
"ha,
ha,
they
didn't
satisfy
a
condition.
"
and
that
was
a
point
that
was
made
by
justice
cardozo
in
the
r.h.
stearns
case
that
we
rely
on,
where
he
said
he
who
prevents
a
thing
from
being
done
may
not
avail
himself
of
the
nonperformance
which
he
himself
has
occasioned.
that's
precisely
what
happened
here.
as
this
case
to
this
court,
it
is
established
that
is
a
child
who
was
entitled
to
receive
special
education
services
back
in
2001.
the
only
reason
he
did
not
receive
those
services
is
because
the
district
violated
its
statutory
duties--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--the
parents
agreed,
your
honor,
that
he
did
not
qualify
for
the
learning
disabilities
they
tested
him
for,
but
they
had
an
obligation
under
the
act
--
and
this
was
found
by
the
hearing
officer
and
the
complaint
that
was
filed
was
filed
within
the
two-year
limitation
to
challenge
that
2001
determination,
and
that
that
was
there,
they
had
an
obligation
to
test
him
for
those
other
health
impairments
at
that
time.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
thank
you.
