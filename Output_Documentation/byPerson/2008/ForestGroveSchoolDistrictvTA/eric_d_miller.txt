mr.
eric
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
had
petitioner
provided
t.a.
a
special
education
that
was
later
determined
to
be
inadequate,
there
would
be
no
question
that
the
district
court
would
have
authority
and
discretion
to
determine
whether
an
award
of
private
school
tuition
reimbursement
was
appropriate.
petitioner's
view
is
that
because
it
offered
no
special
education
at
all,
it
was
therefore
categorically
immune
from
such
an
award.
that
position
is
not
supported
by
the
statute
and
it's
inconsistent
with
the
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
secretary
of
education.
there
is
no
basis
for
reading
the
statute
to
create
what
effectively
would
be
an
incentive
for
districts
to
stonewall
and
to
say
that
if
they
don't--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--we
were
not
assuming
bad
faith.
or--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well
there--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
--
congress
--
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
congress
wanted
to
create
an
incentive
or
to
reward
districts
that
do
do
that.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
absolutely
right.
so
in
a
case
like
this,
there
is
--
there
is
nothing
to
try
for
10
days
because
the
district
has
found
him
not
eligible,
they
haven't
offered
any
special
education
or
related
services.
now
to
the
extent--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--in
the
case--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well
if
the
--
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
interest
in
having
parents
try
out
the
plan,
petitioner's
reading
of
the
statute
is
poorly
tailored
to
that
objective,
because
it
doesn't
require
that
they
try
the
specific
plan
that's
being
proposed
for
10
days.
even
under
petitioner's
reading
the
statute
simply
would
require
that
the
child
at
some
point
have
received
some
special
education
and
related
services.
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
under
the
plan
that
was
being
tried.
and--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
not
necessarily
because
there's
a
new
plan
at
least
once
a
year
under
the
statute,
and
they
are
typically
proposed
at
the
end
of
a
school
year
for
the
start
of
the
new
school
year.
so
there
wouldn't
be,
on
petitioner's
reading,
a
requirement
that
you
show
up
for
the
first
10
days
of
the
new
year;
you
would
just
have
to
give
notice
after
the
iep
is
proposed
in
may
or
june.
you
give
your
10
days'
notice.
you
receive
special
education
services
under
the
old
plan,
under
the
previous
year.
and
under
--
on
petitioner's
reading,
the
statute
would
be
no
barrier
to
reimbursement
there.
now,
of
course,
the
district
courts
do
have
considerable
equitable
discretion,
and
we're
not
suggesting
that
reimbursement
would
be
mandatory
in
that
case
or
in
any
case.
and--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
--
that's
absolutely
right.
and
they
would
also,
in
our
view,
have
to
show
the
district
court
that
they
had
genuinely
cooperated
with
the
public
school
in
making
their
child
available
for
evaluation--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
presumption
would
be
difficult
to
reconcile,
i
think,
with
1415(i)(2)(c)(iii),
which
says
that
the
district
court
decision
should
be
based
on
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
but
it
is
certainly
within
the
district
court's
discretion
and
it
would
be
within
this
court's
discretion,
i
think,
to
prescribe
principles
to
guide
the
exercise
of
the
district
courts'
equitable
discretion--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--right.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
right.
well,
the
--
the
standard
in
both
stages
of
the
proceeding
is
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
the
parents,
as
the
party
challenging
what
the
school
has
done,
have
the
burden.
but
at
both
stages,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
consider
whether
they
were
genuinely
seeking
a
free
appropriate
public
education,
and
i
think
it
would
be
entirely
appropriate
and
consistent
with
the
preponderance
standard
for
the
hearing
officer
or
the
court
to
take
due
account
of
the
fact
that
the
school
district
has
some
expertise
and
to
give
some
deference
to
what
it
has
proposed.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
oh,
it's
(i)(2)(b)
--
it's
been
amended
in
2004.
there's
no
change
in
the
language,
but
it's
now--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--(c).
mr.
eric
d.
miller
34
c.f.r.
300.148(b)
says
that
disagreements
between
the
parents
and
a
public
agency
regarding
the
availability
of
a
program
appropriate
for
the
child
and
the
question
of
financial
reimbursement
are
subject
to
the
due
process
hearing
procedures.
so
yes,
that
regulation
gives
hearing
officers
the
authority
to
award
reimbursement,
as
indeed
the
hearing
officer
had
done
in
burlington.
burlington
was
the
case
where
the
reimbursement
award
was
made
in
the
first
instance
by
a
hearing
officer,
and,
of
course,
the
court
held
that
that
was
appropriate.
and--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
of
the
additional
costs
of
treating
special
education
children,
above
those
of
educating
other
children,
i
think
approximately
10
percent,
10
to
12
percent,
is
reimbursed
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
there's
no
basis
for
supposing
that
there
would
be
a
vast
expansion
of
liability,
and
there
are
some
statistics
on
this
in
the
national
disability
rights
network's
amicus
brief
at
pages
13
and
14.
of
about
6
million
children
in
the
united
states
who
are
receiving
special
education,
barely
1
percent
of
those
are
in
private
placements,
and
the
vast
majority
of
those
are
agreed-upon
placements
between
school
districts
and
the
parents.
so
this
sort
of
unilateral
private
placement
is
quite
rare,
because,
first,
the
parents
do
it
at
their
own
financial
risk,
and
so
there's
a
real
barrier
to
parents
doing
it,
because
they
have
to
be
pretty
sure
that
they
are
right
and
that
they
are
going
to
be
able
to
meet
the
demanding
standards
of
--
satisfying
the
district
court
that
an
award
of
tuition
reimbursement
is
appropriate,
and
if
they
don't
do
that--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--they're
going
to
be--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no.
what
this
court
said
in
carter
is
that
it's
appropriate
for
the
hearing
officer
to
take
into
account
whether
the
cost
of
the
private
education
was
unreasonable.
so
in
a
situation
where
you
had
two
basically
equivalent
schools,
that
would
certainly
be
an
appropriate
thing
for
the
hearing
officer
to
take
into
account
in
limiting
or
denying
reimbursement.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
--
that's
right.
that
would
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
hearing
officer.
in
a
case
like
this,
where
you
have
a
residential
placement
and
the
residential
component
of
it
--
there
has
been
no
suggestion
that
that
was
--
had
some
educational
purpose
or
was
a
part
of
providing
an
appropriate
education,
it
would
also
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
decide
to
disaggregate
that
and
say
we
are
only
paying
--
the
school
district
only
has
to
pay
for
the
educational
component.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
there
would
be
no
categorical
bar
in
the
statute
in
that
situation,
but
a
district
court
confronted
with
those
facts
would
most
likely
conclude
that
the
parents
had
not
genuinely
sought
a
free
appropriate
public
education
and
hadn't
appropriately
cooperated
with
the
school
district.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
thank
you.
