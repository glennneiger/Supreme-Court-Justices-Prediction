justice
john
paul
stevens
i
still
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
scalia.
what
if
the
school
board
just
was
adamant
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
any
special
education?
it
just
maintained
that
position
throughout
the
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
got
a
stay
and
they
wanted
to
appeal
it.
and
if
they
did
what
happens?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
don't
have
a
risk
under
your
view
of
the
law
as
i
understand
it.
they
could
take
that
position
and
they
would
never
be
liable
--
never
be
liable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
the
consequence
of
your
position
as
i
understand
it,
that
they
could
do
that
and
they
would
not
have
any
risk
of
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
create
an
incentive
for
the
school
board
to
just
say,
we'll
never
provide
any
kind
of
education,
special
education,
we
will
just
tough
it
out?
because
they
can't
lose,
they
can't
be
liable
if
they
do
that,
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
a
private
specialist
diagnosed
respondent
with
a
learning
disability,
his
parents
placed
him
in
a
private
academy
that
dedicated
to
students
with
special
needs.
respondent's
parents
then
requested
an
administrative
hearing
under
the
individuals
with
disabilities
education
act,
the
idea,
to
determine
whether
respondent
was
eligible
for
public
special
education
services.
the
hearing
officer
concluded
that
respondent
was
eligible
and
that
the
school
district
was
wrong
in
failing
to
identify
his
disability
and
provide
him
with
appropriate
special-education
services.
finding
also
that
respondent's
private
school
placement
was
appropriate,
the
hearing
officer
ordered
the
school
district
to
reimburse
respondent's
parents
for
the
cost
of
his
private-school
tuition.
the
district
court
set
aside
the
award,
holding
their
recent
amendments
to
idea
categorically
bar
reimbursement
unless
a
child
has
previously
received
public
special
education
services.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
including
that
a
court
may
order
reimbursement
if
the
school
district
has
failed
to
meet
its
obligations
under
idea
and
the
child
has
been
placed
in
an
appropriate
private
school.
a
child's
previous
receipt
of
public
special-education
services
is
not
an
absolute
prerequisite
for
reimbursement.
we
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit.
several
years
ago,
we
held
in
a
case
called
school
committee
of
burlington
that
if
provision
of
idea
authorizing
courts
to
award
“appropriate”
relief
permits
reimbursement
for
the
cost
of
private-school
tuition
when
a
school
district
fails
to
provide
adequate
special-education
services
and
the
child's
private
school
placement
is
appropriate.
congress
amended
idea
in
1997
adding
provisions
that
elaborate
on
the
circumstances
in
which
reimbursement
is
appropriate.
the
amendments
made
no
change
to
the
central
purpose
of
idea
or
to
the
text
of
the
provision
we
construed
in
the
burlington
case.
accordingly,
we
do
not
read
the
amendments
to
abridge
the
authority
of
courts
and
hearing
officers
to
award
reimbursement
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
a
contrary
reading
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
text
and
purpose
of
idea
and
it
would
produce
the
absurd
result
of
providing
a
remedy
when
a
school
offers
a
child
inadequate
special-education
services
that
leave
parents
without
a
remedy
when
the
school
unreasonably
denies
access
to
such
services
altogether.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia
and
thomas
have
joined.
