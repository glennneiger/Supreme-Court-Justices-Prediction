mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
1997
amendments
to
idea
prohibit
tuition
reimbursement
awards
for
students
who
are
unilaterally
placed
in
private
school
without
first
having
received
special
education
services
from
the
public
school
district.
this
is
so
under
ordinary
principles
of
statutory
construction
and
particularly
so
under
the
spending
clause
clear
notice
rule.
prior
to
1997,
idea
did
not
expressly
address
tuition
reimbursement
for
unilaterally
placed
students.
in
1997,
congress
added
section
1412(a)(10)(c).
in
subsection
(i),
congress
provided
that
when
the
school
district
makes
a
free
appropriate
public
education
available,
a
fape,
no
reimbursement
is
allowed.
and
then
in
subsections
(ii)
through
(iv),
congress
addressed
situations
where
courts
and
hearing
officers
may
award
tuition
reimbursement
and
said
that
reimbursement
may
be
allowed
where
the
school
district
does
not
make
a
fape
available
to
a
student
who
previously
received
special
education
services
from
the
public
district.
congress
said
nothing--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--that's
correct.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
no.
subsection
(i)
covers
students
who
are
provided
a
free
appropriate
public
education.
subsections
(ii)
through
(iv)
address
the
other
category
of
students--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--those
who
are
not--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--that
--
that
might
be
the
implication
if
there
weren't
subsection
(c)(ii)
through
(c)(iv).
so
it's
--
it's
t.a.'s
argument
and
the
government's
argument
that
(c)(i)
sets
forth
the
general
rule,
but
if
that
were
the
way
that
--
that
congress
meant
the
statute
to
operate,
it
wouldn't
have
had
any
reason
to
put
in
(c)(ii)
through
(c)(iv)
because
we
would
already
know
from
(c)(i)
that
tuition
reimbursement
was
a
possibility
for
students
who
did
not
receive
--
previously
receive
special
education
services
from
the
public
district.
congress
instead
went
on
in
(c)(ii)
through
(c)(iv)
to
address
very
specifically,
in
the
context
of
a
comprehensive
statutory
scheme,
when
tuition
reimbursement
would
be
available
to
students
who
did
not
previously
receive.
and
congress
specified,
after
essentially
being
invited
to
do
so
in
burlington,
which
of
those
students
could
get
tuition
reimbursement.
and
the--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--oh,
no.
it--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--yes,
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying.
and
--
and
they
deal
with
different
sets
of
students.
in
(i),
the
school
district
has
made
a
fape
available;
in
(ii)
through
(iv),
the
school
district
has
not
made
a
fape
available.
and
no
mention
is
made
of
when
a
fape
is
not
made
available
to
a
student
who
had
not
previously
received.
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
arlington,
because
those
students
like
t.a.
who
had
not
previously
received,
are
not
mentioned,
yet
congress--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--if
--
if
it's
an
incorrect
determination
by
the
school
district,
the
problem
is
remedied
rather
quickly.
there
are
very
tight
time
frames
in
idea--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--that's
correct.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
right.
and
then
only
after
the
fact
went
to
the
school
district
and
asked
for--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--well,
it's
--
the
tuition
is
$5,200
a
month.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
yes,
and
then
there's
a
$5,200
alumni
services
fee,
a
$1,500
interview
fee.
but
let's--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--no,
there
isn't.
so--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--that's
correct,
but
there's
no
need
to
wait
years.
let's
assume
that
parents
actually
went
through
the
process
appropriately,
unlike
t.a.'s
parents--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--yes.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
that's
correct.
that
was
in
2001,
and
the
district
judge,
at--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--at
page
39
of
the
petition
to
the
--
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
page
39
note
3,
the
district
judge
noted
that
the
2001
evaluation
is
an
appropriate
part
of
this
case.
but
for
this
--
for
the
parents
who
try
and
get
their
student
--
get
their
student
evaluated,
the
school
district
says,
"no.
"
"the
child
is
ineligible.
"
and
then
the
parents
--
at
that
point,
the
timing
kicks
in.
the
parents
can
ask
for
a
due
process
hearing
the
next
day.
under
the
time
periods
that
were
in
place
when
t.a.'s
case
was
going
through--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--the
hearing
officer--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--well,
it's--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--i
think,
in
a
situation
where
the
school
district
finds
the
child
ineligible
and
there
is
an
appeal,
both
the
eligibility
and
the
appropriate
placement
are
decided
in
front
of
the
hearing
officer.
and
there
was
a
45-day
time
period
at
the
time
t.a.'s
case
went
through
for
the
hearing
officer
to
make
a
decision.
and
then
after
that,
it's--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--i
suppose
if
the
school
district
were
to
get
a
stay
of
the
hearing
officer's
decision
pending
appeal
to
the
district
court.
but
that's
not
what
happened
here.
what
happened
here
is
that
the
hearing
officer
decided
on
june
--
january
26,
2004,
that
t.a.
was
eligible.
on
february
19th,
quicker
than
the
30
days
allowed,
forest
grove
school
district
proposed
an
iep
that
could
have
started
as
soon
as
possible
thereafter,
as
the
regulations
require.
so
you
are
talking
about
a
very
tight
--
i
understand
the
situation
that
you
are
hypothesizing,
justice
ginsburg,
but
we
are
talking
about
a
very
tight
turnaround
in
t.a.'s
case,
75
days,
which
is
a
matter
of
weeks,
not
a
matter
of
years
as
was
the
case
in
burlington.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
excuse
me?
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
it
turns
into
a
matter
of
years,
but
in
the
interim
this
school
district,
forest
grove
school
district,
while
it
was
litigating
in
the
district
court,
forest
grove
school
district
offered
an
iep,
and
at
that
point
t.a.'s
parents
could
have
tried
the
iep
out,
sent
the
child
to
receive
services
in
the
public
school
district--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--yes.
less
than
4
weeks
after
the
hearing
officer
was
finished,
forest
grove
offered
an
iep,
and
that's
in
the
addendum
to
our
reply
brief.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
it
can
go
on
for
a
long,
long
time
if
the
parents
file
for
a
due
process
hearing,
and
that
it
can--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--but
all
the
parents
have
to
do
in
that
situation
is
to
give
the
iep
a
try
and
send
their
child
to
public
school.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
i
don't
think
one
day
could
be
right.
the
statute
says
--
it
--
it
expressly
says
"who
previously
received
special"
--
"special
education
service
under
the
authority
of
a
public
agency.
"
it
doesn't
say
how
long
it
has
to
be.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
that
--
that's
a
discretionary
factor
that
courts
and
hearing
officers
can
--
it's
not
a
hard
and
fast
rule.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
but
i
think
it's
probably
good
as
a
general
benchmark.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
yes,
so
long
as
--
in
the
ordinary
case,
ten
days
would
--
it's
in
the
statute,
so
we
have
that
textual
indication.
and
it
will
provide
the
school
district
a
chance
to
provide
services
under
the
iep.
and
as
this
court
mentioned
in
a
prior
case,
iep's
--
it's
not
an
exact
science
and
when
you
look
at
it
on
a
piece
of
paper
it's
hard
to
know
whether
it's
going
to
work
or
not.
the
way
you
find
out
whether
it
works
is
where
the
rubber
hits
the
road
and
it
could
be
that
the
parents
look
at
iep
and
say,
you
know
what,
i
don't
think
this
is
going
to
work.
but
until
you
actually
give
it
a
chance
to
work
--
maybe
the
child
goes
in
and
--
and
works
with
the
special
education
teacher
or
the
instructional
assistant
and
they
really
hit
it
off.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
it's
certainly
plausible
under
certain
circumstances.
it
--
it
may
not
happen
every
time.
and
it
may
not
happen
half
the
time.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
at
that
point
those
arguments
can
be
made
under
(c)(iii)
and
(c)(iv)
because
at
that
point
the
child
would
no
--
the
parents
would
no
longer
be
categorically
barred
from
seeking
tuition
reimbursement
and
those
are
arguments
that
you
can
make
to
the
hearing
officer.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
i
--
i
don't
think
i'm
saying
that.
i'm
saying--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--i
think
that
assumes
that
the
school
district
is
not
going
to
abide
by
the
order
of
the
independent
hearing
officer.
and
in
this
--
in
our
case.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
right.
before
the
hearing
takes
place,
there
is
45
days,
and
then
well,
the
hearing
--
there's
a
request
for
a
due
process
hearing,
the
hearing
officer
has
45
days,
and
then
if
the
hearing
officer
says
this
child
is
eligible,
district,
you
must
propose
an
iep,
the
district
has
30
days
after
that.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
absolutely,
the
district
can
appeal.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
i
suppose
it,
yes,
unless
it
gets
a
stay
of
the
hearing
officer's
ruling.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
but
that
didn't
happen
here
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
cases
which
it
did
happen.
in
this
case
there
are
two
tracks.
the
hearing
officer
said:
t.a.
is
eligible;
prepare
an
iep.
the
district
said:
i
disagree;
i'm
going
to
appeal
to
the
district
court.
but
in
t
mean
time,
within
less
than
28
days,
t
district
prepared
an
iep
and
offered
it
to
t.a.
and
at
that
point
t.a.
could
have
accepted
the
services,
thus
rendering
him
eligible
for
tuition
reimbursement.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
i
think
the
assumption
is
that
the
school
district
would
not
abide
by
a
lawful
order
of
a
hearing
officer.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
in
that
situation
there
would
be
no
--
and
i'm
not
aware
of
that
situation
ever
happening--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--there
would
be
a
delay
in
that
situation,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
where
that
situation
--
where
a
school
district.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
i
think
that's
a
hypothetical
risk,
because
again
i
haven't
seen
any
situations
where
that
actually
has
occurred.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
that's
true,
and
i
think
--
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
--
it's
really,
this
is
really
a
legislative
question.
perhaps
congress
ought
to
further
amend
the
statute
to
say
in
those
situations
where
a
school
district
is
being
obstreperous
in
refusing
to
comply
with
the
hearing
officer's
order,
in
those
situations
there
is
going
to
be
an
exception
to
the
exception.
but
it's
not
--
it's
not
the
statute
that
congress
wrote.
congress
wrote--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--i
--
i
suppose
hypothetically
it
does,
but
my
understanding
is
that
that
just
doesn't
happen.
in
schaffer
v.
weast
and
other
cases,
the
assumption--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--your--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--that's
correct.
and
i
--
i
don't
think
there
could
be
reimbursement
under
subsection
(ii).
perhaps
if
there
were
a
parallel
rehabilitation
act
claim
under
504,
that
might
be
a
vehicle
to
get
relief
in
a
situation
where
the
school
district
is
acting
as
horribly
as
being
hypothesized,
but
not
under--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--it's
conceivable
that
--
that
a
court
could
hold
that.
a
court
could
also--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--that's
the
scheme
that
congress
wrote
in
the
statute,
yes,
under
--
under
(c)(ii).
and
it
has
to
work
that
way,
because
--
i
want
to
come
back
to
a
--
to
a
point
that
was
aired
in
the
briefs,
which
is
t.a.'s
argument
and
the
government's
argument
rests
upon
the
notion
that
section
1415(i)(2)(b)(iii)
gives
hearing
officers
the
authority
to
award
tuition
reimbursement.
that
provision
doesn't
give
hearing
officers
any
authority
to
do
anything,
let
alone
to
award
tuition
reimbursement.
the
only
provision
in
idea
that
gives
hearing
officers
the
authority
to
award
tuition
reimbursement
is
1412(a)(10)(c)(ii).
so
if
the
statute
doesn't
work
--
the
statute
doesn't
work,
and
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
1415(i)(2)(b)(iii)
is
implausible
because
it
accords
to
hearing
officers
the
authority
that
it
doesn't
have.
there
is
another
textual
clue
why
the
statute
works
in
the
way
that
i
am
suggesting,
and
that
is
in
the
'97
amendments
in
subsections
(iii)
and
(iv)
congress
gave
very
explicit
guidance
to
courts
and
hearing
officers
as
to
the
factors
the
court
and
hearing
officer
should
consider
when
deciding
whether
to
award
tuition
reimbursement
to
a
student
who
previously
received
special
education
services.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
i
think
the
--
the
court
already
has
adopted
that
presumption
in
schaffer
v.
weast.
school
districts
are
presumed
to
be
acting
in
good
faith.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
well--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--i
suppose
you
would
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
there
is
some
deference
given
to
--
are
you
talking
about
the
deference
that
the
district
court
gives
to
the
hearing
officer?
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
not
--
not
in
this
case.
in
this
case
under
oregon
law
at
the
time
--
and
this
was
a
pre-schaffer
decision
--
the
hearing
officer
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
school--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--on
the
question
of
eligibility.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
i
--
i
think
that
the
diagnosis
is
more
in
terms
of
eligibility.
it's
under
--
under
(b)(6),
the
hearing
officer
can
decide
--
can
consider
issues
of
identification,
eligibility,
and
placement.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
it
works.
a
diagnosis
--
a
finding
of
eligibility
or
not
is
not
a
diagnosis.
it
is
just
an
eligibility
finding,
and
that's
something
that
the
parents
can
take
to
a
--
a
due
process
hearing
under
1415(f).
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
address
the
two
provisions
that
we
have
heard
today
for
the
first
time.
t.a.
and
the
government
are
resting
their
argument
that
tuition
reimbursement
is
permitted
in
the
unilateral
placement
context
to
students
who
had
not
previous
received.
the
regulation
300.148
--
counsel
referenced
subsection
(b),
disagreements
about
fape,
and
it
does
say
that
the
hearing
officer
can
consider
the
question
of
financial
reimbursement.
and
the
very
next
subsection,
(c),
is
entitled
reimbursement
for
private
school
placement,
and
that
provision
speaks
only
to
students
who
previously
received
special
education
and
related
services
under
the
authority
of
a
public
agency.
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
this
isn't
--
this
regulation
was
brought
up
at
argument.
it's
not
in
any
of
the
addendums,
but
i
--
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
subsection

in
terms
of
the
--
the
provision
that
t.a.'s
lawyer
addressed,
1415(b)(6),
no
argument
--
there's
no
argument
in
the
briefs
that
1415(b)(6)
gives
hearing
officers
the
authority
to
grant
tuition
reimbursement
in
these
circumstances.
the
department
of
education
did
not
rely
on
this
provision
when
articulating
its
commentary
that
tuition
reimbursement
is
still
permitted
under
these
circumstances.
the
secretary
of
education
relied
upon
the
1415(i)(2)(b)(iii)
provision.
that
of
course,
refers
only
to
courts.
and
even
if
the
argument
were
properly
presented,
which
it
isn't,
it
would
be
subject
to
the
same
dynamic
that's
in
play
with
respect
to
1412(a)(10)(c)(ii).
you
have
a
very
general
provision
giving
hearing
officers
authority.
congress
got
specific
in
1997.
there's
a
heading
--
enacted
a
provision
under
the
heading
reimbursement
for
private
school
placement.
i
think
that
clearly
indicates
that's
where
congress
intended
to
repose
the
authority
of
hearing
officers
to
order
tuition
reimbursement
to
unilaterally
placed
children.
we
also
have
the
--
and
--
and
it
just
doesn't
work
to
say
that
1415(i)(2)(b)(iii)
somehow
gives
hearing
officers
authority.
even
if
it
were
interpreted
that
way
prior
to
1997,
in
1997
congress
enacted
the
statute
that
expressly
referenced
hearing
officers
and
courts,
and
allowed
both
of
them
to
give
tuition
reimbursement.
so
even
if
1415
were
interpreted
prior
to
'97
--
incorrectly,
we
would
submit
--
to
give
hearing
officers
that
authority,
after
1997
where
congress
actually
went
to
the
trouble
of
saying
hearing
officers
and
courts
can
give
tuition
reimbursement
in
certain
circumstances,
that
--
that
prior
interpretation,
whatever
its
merits
back
then,
no
longer
is
valid--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--that's
correct,
but--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--the
spending
clause,
the
headings
that
congress
used--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--at
any
rate
--
and
it's
a
system
that
doesn't
make
any
sense,
because
for
children
who
did
previously
receive
and
go
to
the
hearing
officer
to
challenge
either
an
eligibility
determination
or
an
improper
iep,
the
hearing
officer
could
award
tuition
reimbursement,
but
for
children
who
didn't
previously
receive
and
then
they
went
in
front
of
the
hearing
officer,
they
would
have
to
--
i
don't
know
what
the
word
would
be
--
appeal
to
the
district
court
in
order
to
get
tuition
reimbursement.
is
it
conceivable
that
that
that
could
be
the
system--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--that's
correct,
but
i'm
saying
if--
mr.
gary
s.
feinerman
--if
t.a.
is
right,
that
would
be
the
system.
thank
you
very
much.
