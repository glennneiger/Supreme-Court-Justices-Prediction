what
about
before?
the
whole
point
is
that
under
the
words
of
the
statute
as
you
interpret
it,
there
is
a
condition
predicate
that
has
to
be
satisfied.
so,
to
say
that
--
to
answer
by
saying,
well,
that
assumes
they
won't
obey
the
hearing
officer,
what
about
before
the
hearing
even
takes
place?
justice
anthony
m.

well,
but
it's
not
that
hypothetical
when
--
there
are
two
prongs.
number
one,
the
school
has
to
agree
first
with
the
diagnosis,
which
in
this
case
they
didn't
even
do
that.
they
had
a
good
faith
disagreement.
second,
they
have
to
have
an
adequate
iep.
so
there
are
two
conditions.
justice
anthony

the
--
the
problem
that
the
government
and
the
parents
have
is
they
have
to
give
some
work
to
(ii).
under
--
under
their
view
(ii)
doesn't
seem
to
do
much
work.
and
the
problem
with
your
position
is
that
it
seems
in
a
way
formalistic
and
in
some
cases
to
encourage
intransigence.
if
we
adopted
a
presumption
that
the
school
district's
diagnosis
was
correct
and
a
presumption
that
it's
--
if
--
if
there
was
a
diagnosis
of
disability,
that
its
individual
education
program
was
adequate,
that
would,
it
seems
to
me,
not
be
all
you
wanted,
but
would
ameliorate
the
position
of
the
school
district.
would
we
have
authority,
do
you
think,
to
adopt
such
a
presumption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
this
--
this
would
be
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
presumption
that
the
--
that
the
iep
is
--
that
the
school
district
designs
is
right,
that
its
diagnosis
is
right.
that's
not
all
you
--
that's
not
all
you
would
be
asking
for.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
would
we
have
authority
to
do
that
if
we
were
to
reject
your
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
we
thought
it
were
sensible
to
add
to
that
burden
the
further
rule
that
the
school
district
is
presumed
to
have
made
the
correct
diagnosis
and,
if
there
is
a
plan
in
that
kind
of
case,
that
the
plan
was
adequate,
and
that
the
parent
would
have
to
show
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
this
is
not
so,
rather
than
just
inventing
it
and
pulling
it
out
of
the
sky.
is
--
is
there
some
authority
in
the
statute
that
would
give
us
warrant
to
do
that?
or
is
there
some
--
any
cases
that
would
give
us
warrant
to
--
to
establish
a
presumption
of
that
kind
in
order
to
recognize
the
long-standing
expertise
of
the
states
in
this
matter
and
in
order
to
allow
section
(ii)
to
do
some
work?
