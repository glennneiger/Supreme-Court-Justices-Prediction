justice

bader

mr.
feinerman,
but
the
--
the
first
provision
that
you
read,
sub
(i),
says
that
there
will
be
no
reimbursement
if
the
agency
has
made
a
free
appropriate
public
education
available
to
the
child
and
the
parents
elected
to
place
the
child
in
private
school.
but
that
"if"
--
if
the
agency
made
a
free
appropriate
public
education
--
and
here,
as
i
understand
it,
the
school
district
said
that
this
child
was
ineligible
for
special
education.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
the
child
was
entitled
to
a
free
appropriate
public
education
and
didn't
get
it,
then
under
this
sub
(i),
wouldn't
the
parents
be
entitled
to
tuition
reimbursement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
your
construction.
but
couldn't
this
be
read
to
say
no
reimbursement
if
--
the
word
is
"if"
--
the
agency,
not
--
so
the
implication
is
if
the
agency
did
not
make
a
free
appropriate
public
education
available,
then--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
--
then
what
happens
in
a
case
which
i
think
is
like
this
one,
where
the
child
doesn't
receive
special
education
because
the
school
has
determined
that
the
child
is
not
eligible?
so
the
child
isn't
getting
public
education,
and
in
the
parents'
view,
confirmed
by
experts,
the
child
is
in
need
of
special
education,
can't
get
it
from
the
public
schools,
because
they
declared
the
child
ineligible.
what
is
such
a
parent
to
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
can
explain
what
the
process
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
justice
scalia
said
the
parents
just
went
away.
the
school
at
an
earlier
point
said
this
child
was
ineligible
for
special
education,
isn't
that
so?
i
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
hearing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
that
hearing
on
eligible
or
not,
or
is
it
on
what
the
iep
should
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
the
school
said
not
eligible,
is
there
--
is
that
question
resolved
first
before
we
ever
get
to
the
iep?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
wouldn't
the
school
say,
we
--
we
have
no
obligation
to
get
up
an
iep
until
the
question
of
eligibility
is
determined?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
iep
--
they
did
the
iep
after
the
hearing
officer
was
finished?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
also
plausible
that
the
district
will
say,
ten
days
is
not
a
fair
trial
for
this
system,
this
is
a
child
with
severe
learning
disabilities
and
to
give
this
iep
a
fair
chance
we
need
ten
months?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
have
--
how
have
hearing
officers
been
proceeding?
i
mean,
here
we
had
a
case
that
went
to
a
hearing
officer.
there
is
no
iep
when
the
hearing
officer
begins
the
process.
in
the
--
on
the
eligibility
or
not,
do
hearing
officers
give
deference
to
the
school
district
and
then
--
so
that's
eligibility.
at
the
iep
stage,
do
they
give
deference
to
the
student?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
the
hearing
officer.
the
hearing
officer
is
the
first-level
decisionmaker.
and
the
school
board
gives
its
reasons
why
it
thinks
the
child
is
ineligible;
the
parent,
the
reasons
that
the
child
is
eligible.
that's
the
threshold
determination.
on
that
threshold
determination
of
eligibility,
do
hearing
officers
presume
in
favor
of
the
school
district?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
salmons,
i
thought
that
the
--
the
courts,
the
district
court,
will
not
provide
for
tuition
reimbursement,
unless
at
least
two
things
are
shown.
one
is
that
the
school
district
did
not
provide
an
adequate
education
for
this
child.
and
two,
that
the
private
school
did,
and
then
there
are
equitable
considerations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
must
find
both,
not
just
that
the
private
school
was
a
good
place,
but
that
the
school
district
did
not
offer
an
adequate
education
for
the
child.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
procedurally
we
--
we
know
that
there
is
a
provision
addressed
to
a
court
for
equitable
relief.
the
question
was
put
before:
where
does
the
hearing
officer
get
the
authority
to
order
tuition
reimbursement?
because
the
statute
on
which
you
rely
for
the
court
speaks
only
to
the
court's
authority.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
in
2001
even
the
parents
agreed
that
he
didn't
--
that
they
didn't
want
to
put
him
in
special
education?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
are
talking
about
two
different
things.
i
think
the
chief
was
talking
about
putting
the
child
in
special
education,
and
keeping
the
child
there
for
10
days.
you
are
talking
about
the
school
district
that
says
"no
special
education;
this
child
is
not
eligible.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
parents
--
i
think
you
agree
that
the
parents
would
have
the
burden
of
showing
both
that
the
school
did
not
provide
an
adequate
education,
an
appropriate
education,
and
that
the
private
school
does?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
district
court
doesn't
get
into
the
act
until
the
hearing
officer
is
done.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
it
would
be
odd
to
have
a
presumption
applicable
in
court
that
isn't
also
applicable
to
the
hearing
officer,
because
the
court
is
reviewing
a
decision
by
the
hearing
officer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
department--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--does
the
--
does
the
department
have
a
regulation
that
says
the
hearing
officer
may
order
the
private
school
--
the
parents
to
be
reimbursed
for
private
school
tuition?
because
it's
not
in
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
there
could
be,
i
suppose,
an
order
that
any
tuition
in
excess
of
a
certain
amount
would
be
the
parents'
responsibility.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
are
you
reading
this?
