mr.
feinerman,
can
we
go
back
to
the
time
frame
again?
i've
just
got
a
question
of
fact.
i
should
know
this,
but
i
don't.
you
said
that
if
the
--
if
the
parents
and
the
school
district
disagree,
it
can
be
remedied
fairly
quickly
because
there's
a
fairly
tight
schedule
set
for
the
administrative
procedure.
what
i
don't
remember,
and
my
question
is
this:
when
the
administrative
steps
have
been
exhausted,
if
there
is
still
disagreement,
is
there
any
limit
on
the
time
in
which
the
--
the
judicial
appeal
has
to
be
resolved?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
the
--
isn't
that
the
kicker
here?
in
other
words,
i
--
i
fully
understand
your
--
your
textual
argument.
i
--
i
can
see
its
soundness
as
a
possibility
that
is
open
to
us
and,
perhaps
on
the
face
of
it,
the
most
likely
possibility,
but
there
is
a
cost,
and
the
cost,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
once
you
get
into
the
--
once
you
get
into
appeals,
this
thing
can
go
on
for
years,
and
you
can't
wait
years
when
--
when
a
kid
is
in
this
kind
of
condition.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
happens
when
we
get
to
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
happens
when
we
get
to
court?
isn't
that
when
it
turns
into
a
matter
of
years?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
i
think
we've
got
to
assume
that
congress
has
some
concern
for
the
parents
who
correctly
say,
this
iep
is
no
good,
it
just
can't
be
done
in
the
school
system,
and
the
kid
needs
a
special
school.
in
that
case,
maybe
--
your
answer
may
be
that's
the
exceptional
case
and
it
shouldn't
drive
the
--
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
about
congressional
intent.
but
in
that
case,
if
the
district
and
the
parents
are
at
good
faith
loggerheads
it
can
go
on
for
a
long,
long
time,
can't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
they
get
the
due
process
hearing.
the
ultimate
result
is
that
the
school
proposes
an
iep;
the
parents,
based
on
what
their
experts
tell
them,
say
that
isn't
going
to
work,
and
the
parents
say
the
only
way
we
can
educate
this
kid
without
his
falling
behind
more
is
to
put
him
in
a
private
school.
at
that
point,
with
assuming
good
faith
here,
it
seems
to
me
you
get
into
court
and
it
can
go
on
for
a
long
time,
if
we
accept
your
--
your
analysis
of
the
text.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
doesn't
that
get
to
the
point
of
something
pretty
formalistic?
i
mean,
somebody
in
the
brief
said,
given
one
day
under
the
iep
and
the
--
if
you
win,
ultimately
the
check
can
be
written.
that
can't
be
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
are
basically
saying
that
the
--
that
the
only
necessary
delay
in
order
to
satisfy
a
condition
for
eligibility,
if
the
parents
otherwise
prevail,
is
a
ten-day
delay.
that's
basically
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
position
is
that
there
are
basically
two
situations:
one,
the
situation
in
which
there
is
an
administrative
order
to
do
an
iep
and
the
school
district
says,
no,
we
won't
do
it.
millions
for
defense;
we
are
going
right
into
appeal,
and
we
are
not
going
to
prepare
the
iep.
in
that
situation,
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
saying,
the
parents
have
no
way
of
getting
relief
under
the
statute.
in
the
case
in
which
there
is
an
order
for
the
iep
and
the
school
district
prepares
the
iep,
even
though
the
parents
think
it
will
be
inadequate,
there
in
fact
is
a
ready
remedy
subject
to
two
delays:
one,
the
time
to
prepare
the
iep;
and,
two,
ten
days
to
give
it
a
try
before
the
parents
take
the
kid
out
of
school.
that's
basically
the
scheme
that
you
are
proposing
that
the
statute
provides;
is
--
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
reference
is
to
a
right
to
be
heard
on
certain
subjects.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
authorizing
a
particular
individual
or
officer
within
a
school
system
to
award
relief.
the
problem
is,
it
says
you
can
be
heard.
it
doesn't
say
who
will
tell
you
or
who
will
tell
the
school
district
to
write
a
check.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
can
you
raise
the
--
you
can
raise
the
claim
to
eligibility
to
a
--
a
private
education
here
without
the
hearing
officer
having
the
authority
to
order
the
school
district
to
provide
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
might
make
senses
to
say
that
the
hearing
officer
can
determine
eligibility;
it
is
then
up
to
the
school
to
pay
it;
and
if
the
school
does
not
pay
it,
then
you
have
got
to
go
into
court
and
get
an
award.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
odds
are
that
it
would
be
under
the
plan.
i
mean,
what
you
say
is
theoretically
possible,
but
in
the
real
world
it's
probably
going
to
be
under
the
plan,
isn't
it?
