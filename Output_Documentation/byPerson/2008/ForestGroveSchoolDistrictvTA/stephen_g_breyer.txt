stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
more
than
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not
--
i
mean,
suppose
--
the
part
i
don't
understand
in
this
statute,
which
may
not
be
relevant
--
i
would
appreciate
the
help.
it
seems
to
me
that
(a)(10)
large
(a)
and
then
(f)
have
something
to
do
with
the
parent
who
never
goes
to
public
school,
the
child
just
goes
to
private
schools
to
begin
with,
and
they
get
something.
if
they
have
--
if
they
have
a
disability,
this
program
pays
them
something,
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
at
the
very
beginning,
at
the
end
of
addendum
page
1.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
in
other
words--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
parent
who
has
a
disabled
child
who
never
thinks
about
the
public
school
system
still
gets
some
money,
but
not
as
much,
for
the
disabled
child?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
money
to
the
school.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
the
school.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so,
it's
money
that
goes
to
the
school
for
a
program?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
money
that
the
children
can
get.
i
get
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
would
it
then
work,
what
is
--
would
this
system
work
under
the
statute?
you
say,
parents,
if
you
are
going
to
a
disabled
child,
you
simply
go
to
a
private
school,
you
get
the
services
you
just
mentioned.
now,
if
you
put
in
--
put
the
child
in
a
public
school,
and
they
find
a
free
appropriate
public
education,
fine,
that's
the
end
of
that,
you
have
to
do
it.
now,
if
they
don't
give
you
a
decent
one,
you
can,
you
can
send
the
child
to
a
private
school,
but
it
has
--
you
have
to
give
it
a
shot
to
the
public
school
system.
now,
that's
what
you
don't
want
the
interpretation
to
be?
you
don't
--
you
are
against
that.
but
--
but
let's
amend
it
a
little.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
am
reading
the
language.
you
may
require
the
district
to
pay
for
someone
who
has
been
enrolled
in
special
services--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
haven't
heard
my
amendment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
amendment
is
the
norm
will
be
give
the
public
school
a
shot,
but
there
could
be
circumstances,
you're
getting
the
run-around,
there
is
need
to
put
that
child
in
a
public
school
now.
in
other
words,
special
equitable
circumstances
that
make
it
reasonable
for
the
parent
not
to
give
the
school
a
shot,
though
that's
the
norm.
and
in
those
unusual
circumstances,
there
would
remain
grounds
for
equitable
relief.
what
about
that
as
an
overall
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
has
several
parts
to
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
have
to
be
willing
to
accept
that
it's
an
unusual
situation,
though
it
may
well
exist,
that
the
judge
is
going
to
reimburse
the
parent
where
that
parent
didn't
give
the
public
school
a
shot.
they
will
have
to
show
there
is
a
good
reason
for
not
doing
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
all
right
with
you
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
are
simply
saying
that
it
was
reasonable
for
the
parent
here.
i'm
not
asking
that
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
happens
--
what
happens
if
the
hearing
officer
can't,
but
why
couldn't
the
court?
i
mean,
they
see
an
unusual
situation.
the
parents
were
justified,
and
it
doesn't
say
there
are
no
circumstances
other
than
--
where
you
couldn't
--
where
they
may
not
pay.
so
the
judge
says,
i
think
this
is
a
situation
where
it
is
--
it
is
equitable
to
pay
the
--
the
reimbursement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
what
says
you
can't
do
that,
other
than
your
basic
point
about
the
"may
require"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
anyway,
the
regs
don't
say
anything
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
the
statute
says
the
hearing
officer
can't
do
that
no
matter
what.
that's
a
separate
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
