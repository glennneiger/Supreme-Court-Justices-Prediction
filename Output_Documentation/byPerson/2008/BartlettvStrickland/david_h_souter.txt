justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
don't
suggest
that
if
there
were
40
percent
white
crossover
voting,
we
would
find
white
bloc
voting
within
the
gingles
condition,
do
you?
do
you
think
that
is
a
serious
possibility?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean
you
really
do
have
an
answer
to
justice
alito's
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
aren't
you
adopting
the
principle
of
maximization?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
this,
and
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
because
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
gingles
came
along
and
i
may
be
forgetting
things.
but
i
--
i
thought
when
you
are
given
the
alternatives
you
were
just
giving,
one
80
percent
and
two
40
percents,
that
because
there
is
not
a
principle
of
maximization
there
simply
is
not
an
abstract
or
bright-line
answer
to
the
question;
and
that
in
order
to
get
an
answer
to
the
question,
you
look
at
all
of
the
other
things
that
districting
authorities
look
to,
and
you
see
how
they
add
up,
whether
we
are
talking
about
compactness,
congruency
with
--
with
--
with
other
political
lines,
and
so
on.
and
unless
you
look
to
all
the
other
things
that
reasonably
can
and
should
be
take
into
consideration
when
districting
is
done,
you
simply
cannot
answer
the
question,
should
there
be
two
40's
or
one
80.
am
i
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
weren't
part
of
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
needs
to
consider
it,
but
i
thought
your
answer
was
it
needs
to
do
it.
is
that
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay
if
there
is
no
reason
for
the
super-majority.
my
point
is
that
you
cannot
answer
the
question
in
the
abstract.
and
when
you
start
to
answer
it,
as
you
are
doing
now,
you
are
going
beyond
the
abstract
and
you
are
getting
into
facts
outside
the
mere
choice
between
two
40's
and
one
80.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
correct.
at
least,
if
it's
not
correct,
you
and
i
are
making
the
same
mistake.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
know
why
it
would
require
maximization.
it
would
--
it
would
certainly
open
the
door
to
--
to
more
districts
required
by
section
2
than
if
we
have
a
50
percent
rule.
but
i
--
i
think
your
brother
conceded
that
when
--
when
you
draw
a
district,
you
are
bound
by
our
case
law
as
well
as
tradition
to
look
to
something
more
than
maximization,
and
maximization
is
in
fact
not
the
law.
so
i
don't
see
why
it
would
be
required.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
that
got
to
do
with
maximization?
justice
david
h.
souter
there
is
no
question
that
if
they
are
--
if
they
win
this
case,
i
think
there
is
no
question
there
will
be
more
claims
requiring
--
or
potentially
more
claims
requiring
adjustment
of
lines
based
on
avoiding
section
2
violation.
i
would
almost
think
that
was
common
ground.
but
that
is
a
different
thing
from
saying
that
the
result
of
those
claims
is
going
to
be
a
required
maximization.
and
that's
--
that's
the
only
point
that
i
--
that
i
meant
to
pick
--
pick
up
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
are
saying
they
will
tend
to
maximization
in
order
to
avoid
litigation.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
since
the
district
is
drawn
from
the
counties
and
there's
a
stipulation
with
respect
to
the
counties,
doesn't
it
follow
in
the
absence
of
some
surprising
fact
that
there
would
be
bloc
voting
or
the
stipulation
would
cover
bloc
voting
in
the
district?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
regardless,
regardless
of
the
--
the
variations
in
mix,
if
you
are
stipulating
that
there's
bloc
voting
in
county
a,
bloc
voting
in
county
b,
and
you
have
got
a
district
made
up
part
of
a,
part
of
b,
doesn't
it
follow
in
--
in
the
absence
of
some
pretty
specific
evidence
to
the
contrary,
that
in
the
district
there
is
probably
going
to
be
bloc
voting?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
have
evidence
in
the
record
--
did
you
put
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
particular
district
is
carved
from
some
peculiar
section
of
county
a
and
county
b,
so
that
the
general
bloc
voting
pattern
does
not
apply
in
the
district?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
just
help
me
on
the
facts,
because
i
may
have
misunderstood
the
facts.
you're
saying
you
did
not
stipulate
that
there
was
bloc
voting;
you
stipulated
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
for
a
factfinder
to
find
that
there
was
bloc
voting.
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and
you're
at
130?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
do
you
make
of
the
--
the
beginning
of
the
next
paragraph?
"plaintiffs
hereby
advise
the
court
that
they
do
not
wish
to
be
heard
further
or
to
present
evidence
regarding
the
remaining
issues.
"
doesn't
--
i'm
not
sure
what
that's
getting
at,
but
when
i
looked
at
it,
i
thought
it
meant
that
the
stipulation
can
control,
i.e.,
it
may
be
found
without
objection
that
there
is
bloc
voting
or
assumed
without
objection
that
there
is
bloc
voting.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
don't
wish
to
present
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
i
realize,
but
when
you
then
say
"and
we
don't
wish
to
present
any
evidence
on
it.
"
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
you
are
conceding
the
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
okay.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
but
--
but
you
are
saying
it's
an
opportunity,
and
what
you
mean
is
it
is
sufficient
to
provide
an
opportunity.
and
justice
breyer's
question
is:
isn't
the
two-to-one
ratio
something
that
we
should
consider
as
also
being
sufficient
to
provide
an
opportunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
--
it's
a
greater
opportunity
than
--
than
would
be
given
to
them
in
--
in
the
district
or
a
pair
of
districts
that
splits
the
minority
population
in
half.
but
how
is
it
in
some
abstract
sense
a
greater
opportunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
opportunities
are
--
are
measured
on
the
ground,
not
in
the
abstract.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
know
if
you
litigate
whether
you
are
--
whether
you
are
really
talking
about
a
--
a
possible
two
percent
variation.
so
that
i
mean,
i
--
i
think
you
have
to
concede
under
your
--
under
your
test
that
there's
going
to
be
more
litigation.
there
is
going
to
be
more
claims
than
there
are
under
a
50
percent
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
except
that
you
have
a
better
chance
so
you
are
more
likely
to
do
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
two
percent
is
pretty
big
in
an
election.
