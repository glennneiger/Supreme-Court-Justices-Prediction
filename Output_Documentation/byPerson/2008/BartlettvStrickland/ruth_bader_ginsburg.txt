and
that
--
that
has
been
stipulated
here,
right,
that
you
meet
the
third
gingles
factor?
so
it's
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
but
the
point
was
made
that,
in
one
of
the
cases
that
you
rely
on,
in
metts,
that
reliance
on
crossovers
to
prove
the
ability
to
elect
the
candidate
of
a
racial
minority's
choosing
undercuts
the
argument
that
the
majority
votes
as
a
bloc
against
the
minority
preferred
candidates.
so
there's
tension
between
the
crossovers
on
the
one
hand
and
showing
that
the
dominant
race
votes
as
a
bloc.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
opening
yourself
to
this
line
of
questioning
about
the
third
factor,
which
is
conceded
by
both
sides,
so
it's
not
in
issue.
but
you
are
opening
it
by
having
a
test
that
looks
to
the
second
and
third
factor
and
leaves
the
first
factor
out
of
it.
i
mean,
whether
you
agree
with
it
or
not,
the
50
percent
line
is
bright
if
you
know
what's
in
and
what's
out.
you
don't
have
any
test
for
the
first
factor
that's
comparable,
that
would
give
district
courts
and
attorneys
some
degree
of
security
about
how
you
determine
the
first
factor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
browning,
i
thought
there
was
something
in
the
record
that
said
never
in
north
carolina's
history
have
you
had
african
americans
able
to
choose
the
--
able
to
elect
the
candidate
of
their
choice
where
the
minority
population
was
less
than
38.37
percent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
does
that
mean
a
proposal
if
you
succeed,
we
should
remand
on
that
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
stipulated.
you
didn't
want
to
argue
the
third
factor.
you
wanted
--
you
just
started
out
by
saying
you
were
tired
of
this
litigation,
we
wanted
to
concentrate
on
one
issue
and
one
issue
only,
and
that
was
the
50
percent
rule.
and
now
you
are
suggesting
that,
well,
no,
the
stipulation
really
didn't
stipulate
away
the
third
factor.
i
thought
you
were
giving
in
on
that
issue
so
that
you
could
get
the
first
issue
decided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
wrong
with
the
clear
rule
that
justice
souter
suggested
in
the
lulac
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
souter,
in
his
opinion
in
the
lulac
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--he
suggested
what
he
called
a
hard-edged
--
a
clear,
hard-edged
rule
which
is
not
going
to
be
an
exclusive
rule,
but,
anyway,
if
you
met
that
standard,
you're
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
--
what
justice
breyer
proposed
a
rule
at
the
end
of
his
question.
he
said:
suppose
you
make
it,
the
threshold,
instead
of
50
percent,
it
would
be
twice
as
many
in
the
african-american
population
as
in
the
crossover
group.
that
would
be
the
threshold.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
were
conceding
that
it
isn't
a
rigid
rule,
and
that
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
should
have
to
be
--
i
mean
they
could
be
48
percent,
i
think
you
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
--
but
yours
is
below?
just
slightly
below.
