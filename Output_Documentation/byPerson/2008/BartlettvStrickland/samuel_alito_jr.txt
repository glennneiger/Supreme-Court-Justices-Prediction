you
can't
say
where
--
how
much
crossover
voting
would
be
so
large
as
to
make
a
difference?
you
can't
say
where
the
line
is
statistically?
justice
samuel

alito,

if
that's
the
case,
then--
justice
samuel

alito,

--if
that's
the
case,
then
your
test
imposes
a
statistical
standard
just
as
your
opponent's
test
does,
doesn't
it?
it's
just
a
different
one.
justice

alito,

suppose
there
is
40
percent
crossover
voting,
and
that's
a
little
bit
--
that's
not
quite
enough
for
the
minority
candidate
to
win.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
can't
even
say
that
40
percent
would
be
sufficient
in
every
instance,
that
that
might
be
--
you
know,
that
might
not
be
enough?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
wouldn't
justice
breyer's
40
percent
rule
be
just
as
arbitrary?
