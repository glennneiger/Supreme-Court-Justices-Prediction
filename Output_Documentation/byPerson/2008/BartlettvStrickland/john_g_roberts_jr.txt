chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
07-689,
bartlett
v.
strickland.
mr.
browning.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
can
you
say
that
this
brings
us
closer
to
a
situation
where
race
will
not
matter
when
it
expands
the
number
of
situations
in
which
redistricting
authorities
have
to
consider
race?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
criticism
of
the
majority-minority
district
approach
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
influence
districts?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
move
--
you've
moved
from
majority-minority
to
crossover
districts.
should
you
continue
to
move
to
so-called
influence
districts?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
would
have
thought
the
possibility
of
coalition
districts
would
be
evidence
that
the
voting
rights
act
has
succeeded,
rather
than
evidence
that
you
need
to
apply
it
more
broadly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
the
obvious
question
when
you
say
15
to
30
percent
is
what
number
of
crossover
voters
would
you
say
demonstrates
that
you
no
longer
need
to
consider
race
in
shifting
a
coalition
district?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
it
could
be
70
percent
that
don't
vote
for
a
particular
candidate.
at
some
point
you
have
to
conclude
that
it's
based
on
the
candidate
rather
than
on
race.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
answer?
what
percentage
of
crossover
voting
would
make
this
not
actionable
under
section
2?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
don't
have
an
answer
to
justice
alito's
question?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
your
theory,
it
would
be
possible
to
challenge
a
majority-minority
district
on
the
ground
that
you
could
draw
a
different
coalition
district,
maybe
more
than
one
coalition
district.
let's
put
it
that
way.
if
you
could
draw
a
majority-minority
district
and
you
could
draw
two
crossover
districts,
does
the
voting
rights
act
impose
a
limit
on
the
choice?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
an
easy
--
i
suspect
that's
a
common
hypothetical.
you
could
draw
a
district
with
80
percent
minority
voters
or
you
could
have,
as
you
have
here,
two
40
percent
districts.
and
the
voting
rights
act
requires
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
are
fighting
over
--
the
district
that
you
want
to
draw,
the
crossover
district,
would
have
39
percent
african-american
voters.
the
district
that
complied
with
state
law
of
the
county
line
would
have
35
percent.
where
the
assumption
is
that
you
have
a
significant
degree
of
crossover
voting,
is
that
really
a
difference
worth
changing
the
voting
rights
act
jurisprudence
for?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
by
"workable"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
it's
4
percent
less
than
the
district
you
propose?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
gets
back
to
the
justice
scalia's
point--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
this
is
designed
to
protect
incumbents.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
browning.
mr.
thurman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
in
the
--
why
in
the
world
would
you
stipulate
to
bloc
voting
in
a
situation
where
you
have
nearly
20
percent
crossover
voting?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
complicated
situations
on
a
rather
critical
point,
what
seems
to
me
a
basic
conundrum,
how
can
you
have
bloc
voting
and
at
the
same
time
have
significant
crossover
voting?
you
take
one
of
those
off
the
table,
it's
kind
of
hard
to
address
the
basic
issue
in
the
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
joseffer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
a
view
on
how
we
should
approach
the
stipulation
adopted
below?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
joseffer.
mr.
browning,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
a
necessary
predicate
to
his
very
question
that
the
majority
group,
the
white
group
does
not
vote
cohesively.
under
your
hypothetical
at
least
11
percent
have
to
swing
over.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
07-689,
bartlett
versus
strickland.
