mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
rule
proposed
by
petitioners
in
this
case
would
effectively
require
maximization
resulting
in,
as
the
court
has
recognized,
judicial
involvement
in
many,
many
more
situations.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
your
honor,
in
this
situation,
we
take
the
position
that
the
people
of
north
carolina
and
their
ultimate
authority,
their
state
constitution,
have
spoken
and
said
that
county
lines
should
be
kept
whole
to
the
extent
practical.
and
the
state's
position
is
the
legislators
disregarded
that
and,
based
on
the
cases,
based
on
lulac,
at
25
percent--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--well,
your
honor,
that
would
be
the
position
they
would
take
of
every
district
that
could
be
drawn
regardless
of
the--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--your
honor,
it
seems
that
if
there
are
going
to
be
more
potential
claims,
and
as
every
legislative
body,
school
board,
city
council,
whatever
it
is,
has
to
follow
section
2,
they
will
have
to
take
this
into
account.
they
will
be
facing
potential
claims
and
they
will
have
to
run
the
risk
of
do
we
look
to
try
to
maximize
a
district
that
might
not
otherwise
be
required,
that
might
violate
a
neutral
criteria--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--your
honor,
i
think
that
is
absolutely
true.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
your
honor,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
we
were
20
months
into
the
litigation,
we
had
just
received
a
partial
ruling
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
we
were
already
at
the
midpoint
of
the
decade.
if
this
court
should
affirm
the
north
carolina
supreme
court,
my
client
will
have
one
election
in
which
they
have
a
district
that
complies
with
the
north
carolina
constitution.
we
quite
simply
wanted
to
move
the
case
along.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
i
agree,
your
honor.
the
other
point
that
i
would
point
out
is,
it
is
not
a
stipulation
that
there
was
sufficient
bloc
voting
within
either
of
the
districts
that
were
drawn.
the
stipulation
was
with
reference
to
bloc
voting
within
the
two
counties.
the
district
that
could
be
drawn
--
there
is
no
stipulation
that
the
alternative
district
does
not
comply
and
would
--
and
therefore
would
require
the
creation
of
the
39
percent
district.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
your
honor,
there
are
very
different
populations
in
these
two
counties,
and
that
is
referenced
in
the
record
with
regards
to
the
growth
in
population;
and
there
is
very
different
minority
populations
in
the
two
counties
because
of
the
influx--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
it
does
not
follow
within
a
particular
section
of
a
district.
i
think
we
all--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--your
honor,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record,
and
it
is
cited
in
the
brief,
that
minority
candidates,
black
candidates
for
judicial
office
and
for
state
auditor
received
between
59
percent
and
62
percent
of
the
vote
in
the
proposed
district.
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
that
comprises
evidence
that
there
is
not
sufficient
bloc
voting.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
your
honor,
we
did
make
a
stipulation
that
there
was
evidence
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
and
that
we
would
stand
by.
there
was
evidence
they
had
an
expert
who
was
willing
to
so
testify.
i
was
responding
to
justice
souter's
question
of
was
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
contention
that
there
might
not
be
bloc
voting
within
the
alternative
district,
and
that
was
--
that
meant
that
black
candidates
can
receive
in
excess
of
60
percent
of
the
vote
in
the
35
percent
district.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
your
honor,
on
page
130a
of
the
--
i
believe
this
is
their
submission,
the--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--i
believe
this
is
the
white
one,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
and
it
starts
out
that,
in
terms
of
the
bloc
voting,
between
the
--
and
the
evidence
presented
by
the
defendant
is
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
racial
difference
in
the
presence
of
those
results
in
the
white
majority
voting
is
sufficient
as
a
bloc
to
defeat
the
minority's
preferred
candidate.
and,
again,
that
comes
down
to
--
the
court
that
it
was
pender
and
new
hanover
county
that
started
the
action
on
129a,
and
that
was
the
stipulation.
and--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--your
honor--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--your
honor,
first
of
all,
we
were
not
stipulating
that
it
did
exist.
we
stipulated
that
it
was
in
evidence,
that
the
court
defined--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--your
honor,
we
do
--
we
let
it
stand
on
its
own,
we
not
wish
to
be
heard
further,
we
do
not
wish
to
take
additional
time
on
that,
given
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
the
other
factor
that
i
think
is
perhaps
most
important
in
considering
this
is
touched
on
briefly
earlier.
section
2
clearly
applies
to
all
jurisdictions.
and
without
the
guidance
of
the
50
percent
rule,
the
bodies
that
are
drafting
are
left
with
an
uncertain
standard
and
a
standard
--
in
this
case,
so
far
as
we
know,
the
state
had
retroactive
--
this
court
--
had
been
used
previously,
are
every
local
government
body
requires
paying
such
an
expert
to
proceed
simply
to
redistrict?
that,
if
you
don't
have
a
clear
rule
to
follow,
presents
a
problem
for
the
many
government
bodies
that
have
to
redistrict
on
a
regular
basis.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
i'm
sorry,
ma'am.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
your
honor,
i
certainly
am
not
criticizing
the
rule
proposed
by
justice
souter,
but--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--your
honor,
i
think
--
the
perspective
--
and
i
can't
help
--
that
it
is
not
as
clear-edged
as
it
seemed
to
the
court,
at
least
to
justice
souter,
that
the
50
percent
rule
does
provide
a
very
clear,
very
limited
sort
of
a
rule
that
can
be
followed
without
getting
involved
in
--
i
do
believe
that
--
race
becomes
very
likely
the
predominant
factor
in
the
redistricting
decision,
because
based
on
the
cases
that
have
come
before
you
already,
there
have
been
claims
that
26
percent,
25
percent--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
yes,
your
honor,
that
is--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
is
entirely
what
we
are
trying
to
find
out,
because
certainly
districts
are
created
where
there
was
no
minority
incumbent,
and
that
can
happen
because
of
changes
in
demographics
or
a
variety--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
answer
is,
yes,
we
are
trying
to
prevent
that
from
happening.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
respectfully,
your
honor,
i
believe
there
is,
because
you
said
you
look
to
see
if
there
is
vote
dilution.
well,
there
needs
to
be
something
to
measure
that
by.
section
5
is
about
retrogression.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
your
honor--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--thank
you,
your
honor.
it
may
take
me
a
second
to
take
it
all
in.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reason
the
50
percent
rule
does
work
is,
at
50
percent,
there
is
a
claim
that
there
is
the
opportunity
and
there
is
voter
registration,
voter
turnout,
a
lot
of
factors
that
can
influence
at
that
point,
but
that
doesn't
prevent
there
from
being
opportunity.
that's
the
choice
of
whatever
group
is
involved.
you
start
dropping
below
50
percent,
and
then
they're
not
being
denied
an
equal
opportunity.
they
have
the
same
opportunity
any
other
group
does.
this
would
require
trying
to
--
because
what
--
basically
the
petitioner's
position
is
--
the
state
in
its
--
position
is,
it
takes
a
minority
group,
and
then
you
find
presumably
another
majority
group
that
shares
political
and
partisan
goals
with
them,
and
you
combine
those
two
together.
so
you
look
not
only
to
the
race
of
one
group
--
that
predominates
first.
then
you
go
find
like-minded
members
of
the
majority
group
to
join
with
them.
and
so
that
is
what
is
being
required.
at
that
point
you
are
not
talking
about
them
being
treated
less
equal
than
anyone
else.
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
your
honor,
i
categorically
reject
that
as
a
human-rights
basis
for
our
argument.
that
is
handled
by
the
third
gingles
prong
and
the
second
gingles
prong.
and
when
you
look
at
what
the
coalition
is,
what
it
is,
and
you
look
at
how
politically
cohesive
it
is.
so
it
could
be
that
50
percent
is
arguably
not
enough
under
the
second
gingles
provision.
but
that
until
you
get
to
50
percent,
you
are
--
again,
it
is
the
way
it
has
been
described
as
a
gate-keeping
function
for
us
to
keep
the
court
out
of
it.
and
it
is
going
to
--
if
this
happens,
you
start
looking
at
combining
a
combination
of
race
or
other
minority
status
and
partisan
politics
and
combining
them
together
for
the
purpose
of
electing
particular
candidates.
and
i
do
not
believe
it's
ever
been
something
that
this
court
has
endorsed
for
the
purpose
of
the
voting
rights
act.
and
if
that
is
the
position
it
takes,
it
starts
to
run
into
the
issue:
is
such
supportable
under
the
solomon
case,
under
equal
protection?
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
but,
your
honor,
first,
i
believe
as
he
said,
as
justice
breyer
said,
that's
an
arbitrary
number
that
he
picked
up
on,
the
50
percent.
the
reason
we
would
submit
that
is
not
simply
an
arbitrary
number
is
that
it
does
deal
with
them.
at
that
point
there
is
an
opportunity,
regardless
of
whether
there
is
the
--
what
it
certainly
does
not
exist--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--your
honor,
i
would
say
that
that
would
not
be
appropriate,
because
at
that
point
you
are
looking
on
--
at
the
basis
of
race
to
give
one
group
a
greater
opportunity
than
another,
and
the
voting
rights
act
is
the
one
group
being
given
less
opportunity
than
another.
and
so
if
you
are
hinting
to
draw
a
district
that
bases
itself
on
race,
that
attempts
to
give
one
group--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--your
honor--
mr.
carl
w.
thurman
iii
--your
honor,
my
answer
to
that
would
be
that
the
--
what
would
be
proposed
is
it
is
required.
it
is
no
longer
left
up
to
the
legislature
to
decide
whether
that
is
appropriate.
and
that
since
it
is
a
requirement,
that
is
not
part
of
the
political
process;
and
it
goes
to
whether
that
is
--
they
are
no
longer
looking
to
what
they
have
left,
but
whether
they
are,
in
fact,
given
more.
