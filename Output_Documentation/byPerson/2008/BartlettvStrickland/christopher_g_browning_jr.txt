mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
voting
rights
act
should
be
interpreted
in
such
a
way
as
to
encourage
a
transition
to
a
society
where
race
no
longer
matters.
in
north
carolina,
coalition
districts
have
been
crucial
in
moving
towards
congress's
ultimate
goal.
coalition
districts
bring
races
together
by
fostering
political
alliances
across
racial
lines.
as
a
result
they
serve
to
diminish
racial
polarization
over
time.
coalition
districts
help
us
in
reaching
the
point
where
race
will
no
longer
matter
in
drawing
district
lines.
these
districts
bring
us
one
step
closer
to
fulfilling
our
nation's
moral
and
ethical
obligation
to
create
an
integrated
society.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
will
require
somewhat
an
increase
in
the
number
of
districts
that
would
be
drawn,
there
is
no
question
about
that,
but
that
increase
is
not
substantial.
but
it
does
cause
race
to
be
much
less
of
a
factor
in
the
redistricting
process.
currently,
if
a
general
assembly
has
a
choice
between
drawing
a
coalition
district
or
a
majority-minority
district,
the
50
percent
rule
that
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
adopted
encourages
states
to
draw
a
majority-minority
district,
and
when
you
do
that
it
causes
race
to
redominate
in
the
process.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
is
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
coalition
districts
allow
us
to
move
away
from
majority-minority
districts
and
create
districts
where
races
are
working
together.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
decision
in
lulac
makes
clear
that
influence
districts
are
not
protected
under
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
it
is
a
matter
of
--
under
the
voting
rights
act,
congress
has
made
clear
that
districts
should
be
drawn
to
protect
minority
voting
rights.
when
there
are
areas
of
the
country
where
there
is
racial
polarization,
districts
--
race
has
to
be
considered
in
drawing
districts
that
will
give
minorities
equal
opportunity,
just
as
majority--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
and
race--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--justice
kennedy,
you
have
to
consider
race
in
drawing
these
districts.
there's
no
question
about
that.
that's
the
very
thing
that
section
of
the
voting
rights
act
requires
us
to
do.
and
you
do
that
because
there
is
racial
polarization.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
that's
certainly
the
decision
in
thornburg
v.
gingles.
under--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
that
was
a
majority
district.
this
court--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
this
court,
of
course,
has
left
open
the
issue
of
whether
the
voting
rights
act
would
protect
minority--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
my
point
is
when
you
are
drawing
districts
under
section
2,
of
course
race
has
to
be
considered,
but
it's
considered
because
the
process
is
not
equally
open
to
minorities.
unfortunately,
north
carolina
has
a
long
history
of
discrimination,
and
that
discrimination
has
resulted
in
current
effects
in
the
voting
place.
there
is
racially
polarized
voting,
as
has
been
stipulated
to
in
this
case.
there
has
been--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
coalition
districts
are
certainly
evidence
that
we
have
made
progress
towards
congress's
ultimate
goal
under
the
voting
rights
act,
but
we
are
not
there
yet.
in
this
district,
the
expert
testimony
is
that
only
15
to
30
percent
of
whites
will
vote
for
a
black
candidate,
and
that
is
still
very
racially
polarized.
but
coalition
districts
help
us
to
move
away.
it
--
they
help
to
diminish
the
amount
of
racial
polarization
over
time,
so
that
eventually
we
won't
need
to
be
looking
at
race
at
all
in
drawing
district
lines,
but
where--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
in
the
gingles
case,
this
court
stated
that
it
was
a
district-bydistrict
determination.
there's
no
bright-line
rule
as
to
where
crossover
voting
is
so
great
that
it
doesn't
satisfy
the
third
gingles
prong.
here,
however,
the
district
was--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
at
some
point
that's
true,
that
it
would
be
issues
beyond
race,
but
here,
the
expert
report
and
as
stipulated
to
by
respondents,
this
voting
is
racially
polarized.
there
is
some
crossover
voting,
but
not
enough
to
say
that
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
have
been
eliminated.
that
crossover
voting
is
sufficient
for
this
district
to
work.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
this
court's,
again,
decision
in
gingles
makes
clear
that
that
is
a
district-by-district
determination.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
justice
ginsburg,
i
completely
agree
that,
at
some
point,
the
crossover
voting
becomes
so
great
that
you
no
longer
have
to
take
into
account
district
lines.
unfortunately--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--we're
not
there
yet.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
what
we're
proposing
and
what
we
think
is
required
by
the
text
of
section
2
is
you
simply
take
the
existing
gingles
factors
and
you
look
at
the
amount
of
racially
polarized
voting,
and
from
that
you
are
able
to
readily
calculate
the
size
of
the
minority
group
that
would
be
sufficiently
large
to
elect
a
minority
--
a
minority
candidate.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
again,
whether
the
third
gingles
prong
is
satisfied
obviously
is
a
district-by-district
determination.
here,
however--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--i'm
hesitant
since
this
court
has
not
set
a
specific
limit,
and
that's,
again,
an
issue
that
has
been
stipulated
to
in
this
case.
the--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--no,
i
think
it
would
be
very,
very
unrealistic
that
you'd
have
40
percent--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
again,
the
third
prong
is
not
an
aspect
of
this
case.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
if
you
are
saying
that
40
percent
is
a
very
high
amount
of
crossover
voting,
that,
of
course,
is
not
our
case,
where
the
crossover
voting
that
is
necessary
to
make
this
coalition
district
work
is
18
percent
crossover
voting.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
40
percent
is
a
high
number,
and
particularly--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
here,
however,
under
this
case,
there's
not
40
percent
crossover--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
as
the
language
the
court
used
in
the
de
grandy
decision
is
whether
the
minority
group
is
sufficiently
large
to
elect
a
minority-preferred
candidate.
there
are,
of
course,
limiting
factors
on
the
side
of
the
coalition
district
which
could
be
drawn.
there
are
practical
limiting
factors
and
there
are
legal
limitations.
the
practical
limitation,
of
course,
is
in
north
carolina,
given
what
has
happened
in
past
elections,
the
north
carolina
general
assembly
appropriately
concluded
that
a
minority
group
of
less
than
40
percent
would
simply
not
work,
that
it
would
not
be
effective
to
give
rise
to
a
minority
--
a
district
in
which
minorities
elect
a
minority-preferred
candidate.
there's
also
a
legal
limitation.
in
the
court's
decision
in
lulac,
the
court
made
clear
that
influence
districts
are
not
protected
by
section
2.
so
as
a
result,
the
minority
group
will
by
necessity
have
to
control
its
coalition
partner;
otherwise
it
would
simply
be
an
influence
district.
and
here
at
a
minority
group
of
40
percent,
the
minority
group
in
the
area
is
substantially
larger
than
the
crossover
voting
that
is
needed
to
have
an
ability
to
elect.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
the
--
assuming
all
of
the
factors
under
gingles
to
be
met,
that
if
you
have
a
minority
group
that
was
packed
in
to
a
--
one
district,
and
in
its
place
two
coalition
districts
could
be
effectively
drawn,
and
those
districts
would
actually
work
and
you
could
meet
all
of
the
other
standards
under
gingles
--
the
district
was
geographically
compact,
there
is--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--in
that
situation,
assuming
you
could
meet
all
of
the
gingles
factors,
that,
yes,
that
80
percent
district
should
be
drawn
as
two
40
percent
districts.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
justice
souter,
certainly
the
--
the
criteria
that
you
have
referred
to
have
to
be
part
of
the
districting
process.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
my
point
is
that
when
minorities
are
basically
put
in
an
enclave,
in
a
separate
district
but
yet
it
is
possible
to
draw
two
districts,
two
coalition
districts,
and
the
other
prongs
of
gingles
have
not
been
met,
so
that
there
is
not
rough
proportionality
throughout
the
state,
yes,
the
districting
body
needs
to
consider
drawing
two
districts--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
it
would
be
--
it
is
our
answer
that
if
a
district
--
if
there
is
not
rough
proportionality
in
a
state,
there
is
a
district
that
is
a
super-majority
and
there
is
no
reason
for
that
super-majority
to
be
in
place.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
no,
justice
souter,
your
point
is
well
taken
and
i
agree
that
with
a
hypothetical
like
that
it's
very
difficult,
unless
you
are
actually
considering
the
specific
situation
of
the
district.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
what
congress
has
required
courts
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
overall
picture
of
the
district.
the
congress,
in
connection
with
the
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act,
used
very
broad
language,
phrases
like
"totality
of
circumstances"
and
"opportunity
to
participate
and
elect".
so
clearly,
congress
intended
for
a
broad
approach
to
be
taken
and
a
functional
one.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
very
point
of
the
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act,
is
when
minorities
do
not
have
equal
opportunity
to
elect
their
candidate
of
choice,
where
they
are
packed
in
to
districts--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
determined
that
this
district
should
not
cut
county
lines.
ironically,
that
county
line
was
a
county
line
that
was
originally
created
to
segregate
blacks
in
wilmington,
in
the
southern
portion
of
the
county,
from
whites
in
the
northern
portion
of
the
county.
so
that
original
discriminatory
act
is
now
being
used
to
keep
a
district
from
--
from
being
a
place
that
is
a
district
that
has
a
proven
ability
to
elect
a
minority--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
government
has
asserted
that
there
should
be
a
near-50
percent
test
which
includes
as
part
of
it
a
--
either
the
district
is
close
to
50
percent
or
there
is
an
element
of
discrimination.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
justice
kennedy,
the
decision
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
is
to
adopt
an
inflexible
50
percent
rule.
that
--
that
was
the
issue
that
was
resolved
on
summary
judgment
by
the--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
that
the
county
line
rule
--
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
concluded
that
this
district
could
not
cut
county
lines
because
this
should
not
be
treated
as
a
section
2
district.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
the
plaintiffs
have
and
the
respondent
and
the
government
have
referred
to
an
alternative
district
that
would
not
cut
those
county
lines
and
would
have
a
black
voting
age
population
of
35
percent.
the
problem
with
that
is
there
is
absolutely
no
testimony
that
that
--
their
alternative
district
would
be
in
any
way
workable.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
undisputed
testimony
of
the
joint
appendix
at
page
73-74
is
to
the
contrary.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
that
this
--
that
the
district
they
propose
was
simply
prepared
by
their
attorney,
looking
at
a
map.
there
is
absolutely
no
testimony
that
this
would
be
an
effective
minority
district,
that
there
would
be
an
equal
opportunity
for
minorities--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--well,
it
is
a
matter
of
the
percentage
of
voting
age
population,
but
more
importantly,
the
district
they
drew
would
have
put
a
black
incumbent,
a
black
democrat
incumbent,
in
the
same
district
with
a
white
republican
incumbent.
if
they
were
serious
about--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
incumbency
certainly
has
to
be
considered
in
the
context
of
what
the
voting
rights
act
requires
us
to
do,
which
is
to
look
at
the
total
picture.
is
it
a
functional
approach?
it
is
a
matter
of
looking
--
undertaking
a
searching
evaluation
of
the
past
and
present
political
realities.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
justice
ginsburg,
there
are
districts
such
as
wake
county,
the
seat
of
government,
where
a
minority
has
been
elected
with
less
than
38
percent.
but
in
areas
of
the
state
where
there
is
highly
racially
polarized
voting,
38
percent
roughly
is
the
effective
floor
that
the
general
assembly
recognized
as
being
workable
for
creating
a
district
such
as
this.
i
will
also
note
that
this
issue
was
not
presented
to
the
north
carolina
supreme
court,
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
an
alternative
district
that
would
somehow
be
feasible
and
workable.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
that
would
certainly
be
one
possibility,
but
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
resolved
this
straight
legal
question
as
to
whether
the
50
percent
rule
is
in
place
and
is
an
--
is
an
inflexible
rule,
and
not
only
did
they
--
they
imposed
this
rule
with
respect
to
this
district,
they
essentially
had
a
mandatory
injunction
on
the
north
carolina
general
assembly
to
never
draw
a
district
at
less
than
50
percent
if
it
cuts
too
many
county
lines;
and
that
is
even
inconsistent
with
the
united
states'
view
of
section
2.
for
that
reason,
alone
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
start
first
of
all
with
justice
breyer's
question
about
the
arbitrary
nature
of
the
50
percent
rule.
the
50
percent
rule,
let
there
be
no
doubt,
is
extremely
arbitrary,
even
under
the
government's
2
percent
cushion.
what
would
happen
is
you
have
a
district
that
is
40
percent
--
46
percent
african
american,
that
district
could
be
freely
carved
off
into
two
districts
of
23
percent
each,
neither
of
which
would
provide
an
equal
opportunity
to
elect.
even
when
you
are
in
a
situation
like
this
case,
where
the
district
is
actually
functioning
and
has
a
proven
ability
to
elect
a
minority
preferred
candidate.
moreover--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--justice
alito,
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
there
are
significant
districts
that
are
out
there
that
would
not
be
protected
under
the
50
percent
rule.
and
i
understand
the
court's
desire
to
have
some
sort
of
limitation
on
the
size
of
the
district.
we
believe
it
is
already
in
there,
in
place
as
a
result
of
the
lulac
decision.
it's
in
place
because
in
north
carolina,
as
a
practical
matter,
you
can't
go
much
below
40
percent
and
have
a
district
that
will
actually
work.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
the
voting
age
population
is
39.36
percent
based
upon
the
census
data.
the
government
wants
to
use
a
2
percent
cushion
as
their
threshold.
but
there
is
some
significant
problems
with
that,
because
when
you
look
at
the
overcount
of
white
voters,
the
census
bureau
recognizes
the
lower
count
is
basically
2
percent
there
in
and
of
itself,
then
there
are
some
undercounted
black
voters
is
a
1
percent
undercount.
so
even
a
48
percent
doesn't
even
get
anywhere
close.
moreover,
you
have
districts
where
there
are
a
number
of
eligible
--
number
of
people
that
are
counted
in
the
census
that
are
not
truly
eligible
to
vote.
that
is
reflected
in
the
brief
by
the
states
at
page
28
in
footnote
2.
the
states
make
the
point
that
there
are
many
districts
where
we
have
military
bases,
we
have
colleges
that
cause
this
to
be
an
extremely
arbitrary
rule.
and
in
north
carolina
there
are
districts
where
once
you
remove
the
military
base
where
most
of
the
population
will
not
be
voting
in
that
district,
there
is
a
shift
of
even
12
percent
in
the
minority
voting
age
population
increasing
by
12
percent
once
you
just
remove
the
military
bases
from
the
equation.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
justice
breyer,
in
our
view
the
rule
that
should
be
applied
is
consistent
with
the
rule
of
lulac,
that
the
minority
group
is
substantially
larger
than
its
coalition
partner.
here
the
minority
group
is
39.36
percent
african
american.
it
only
requires
an
additional
roughly
11
percent
white
crossover
voting.
so
the
white
crossover
voting
that
is
needed
is
only
a
third
of
the
size
of
the
minority
group.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
this
district
is
39.36
percent
african
american.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
and
you
need
11
percent
crossover
voting,
11
percent
of
the
electorate--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
here
the
minority
group,
the
expert's
testimony
is
that
they
do
vote
cohesively.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
the
--
the
white
vote
does
not
vote
100
percent
cohesively.
but
it
is
still
at
such
high
levels,
there
is
only
a
limited
amount
of
crossover
voting.
it
is
still
very
racially
polarized.
and
if
district
lines
are
not
taken
into
account,
the
--
the
votes
of
black
voters
in
the
district
will
be
drowned
out
by
the
white
voters
that
are
voting
against
that
minority
candidate
simply
because
that
candidate
is
a
minority.
there
is
some
crossover
voting,
but
not
enough
to
make
the
--
for
us
to
lose
on
the
third
gingles
prong.
