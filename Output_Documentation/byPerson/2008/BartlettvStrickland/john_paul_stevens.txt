in
this
case
which
way
does
the
presumption
favoring
what
the
legislature
did
cut?
here
the
court
set
aside
what
the
legislature
did;
is
that
not
right?
justice

mr.
thurman,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
it
seems
to
me
that
a
rigid
51
percent
rule
assumes
that
the
minority
communities
throughout
the
country
are
all
alike,
and
that
there
is
enough
variety
in
every
district
and
every
part
of
the
country
where
we
have
this
problem.
there
are
variations.
maybe
51
percent
would
not
be
enough.
the
minority
group
might,
itself,
be
divided
as
is
often
the
case.
i
--
i
think
the
underlying
premise
--
the
underlying
--
the
premise
underlying
your
argument
is
that
all
minorities
are
exactly
alike.
that's
why
we
can
have
this
mathematical
figure,
and
that
answers
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mention
how
well
it
worked.
did
you
see
the
graphs
--
one
of
amicus
briefs
have
the
graph
showing
what
the
50
percent
rule
did
for
one
gerrymander
and
how
the
lesser
percentage
worked
out
--
remember
which
were
much
more
--
not
using
the
50
percent
rule
produced
much
more
compact
districts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
were
designed
to
produce
50
percent,
and
that's
why
they
got
so
--
so
--
so
grotesque.
