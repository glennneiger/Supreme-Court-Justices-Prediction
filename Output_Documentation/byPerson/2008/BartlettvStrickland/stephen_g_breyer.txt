i
don't
see
how
those
claims
could
possibly
succeed,
but
i
thought
--
let's
go
back
to
sort
of
step
1.
my
mind
turns
a
little
confused
when
i
start
thinking
of
these
cases.
are
we
talking
about
a
case
of
--
where
the
claim
is
normally
vote
dilution?
is
that
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
section
2
--
does
vote
dilution
mean
we
who
are
a
minority
group,
let's
say
a
black
group,
could
have
elected
a
candidate
of
our
choice
more
likely
than
the
white
group,
but
because
you
are
engaged
in
vote
dilution,
that
isn't
going
to
happen
anymore?
is
that
the
form
of
the
claim?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
form
of
the
claim.
then,
it's
our
problem
here
that
to
see
whether
that's
so,
you
have
to
see
whether
the
black
group
did
really
vote
as
a
group.
did
they
used
to
have
a
good
chance
to
elect
the
person
they
want,
and
does
the
white
group
tend
to
also
vote
as
a
group
and
swamp
them?
is
that
what
we
are
trying
to
find
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
that
can
happen.
but
is
the
evil
we
are
trying
to
get
at,
the
evil
of
a
black
group,
when
they
stick
together
in
polarized
voting,
having
less
of
a
chance
of
getting
their
candidate
elected
than
when
the
white
group
does
the
same?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
we
are
trying
to
prevent?
okay.
if
that's
what
we
are
trying
to
prevent,
then
haven't
we
learned
that
putting
a
threshold,
because
you
can't
even
get
in
the
door
--
you
can't
even
get
in
the
door
--
unless
the
black
group
accounted
for
50
percent
of
something,
the
voters
or
the
people
who
turn
out,
that
that
doesn't
make
much
sense
for
the
reason
that
justice
scalia
started
with.
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
because
sometimes
they
account
for
51
percent,
but
they
can't
elect
anybody,
because
they
all
divide
on
four
different
people,
or
maybe
they
didn't
turn
out.
on
the
other
hand,
sometimes
if
they
account
for
43
percent,
they
could
elect
the
candidate
of
their
choice.
so
it
looks
as
if
that
50
percent
is
pretty
arbitrary
and
we're
looking
for
a
better
criterion.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
what
i've
said
so
far?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here
what
we've
--
could
we
look
to
see
whether
the
three
gingles
factors,
whatever
they
are
--
one
was,
is
the
black
group
numerous
enough
to
elect
the
candidates
of
their
choice?
reasonably
compact,
politically
cohesive?
and
then
you
look
to
see,
does
the
white
group
tend
to
vote
as
a
bloc
to
stop
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
we
should
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i'm
back
to
my
problem,
that
sometimes
the
50
percent
criteria
just
doesn't
measure
that
first
part.
and
so
you
say,
well,
any
other
matter
would
be
worse,
but
i
bet
we
could
invent
some
that
were
actually
better.
suppose
you
wouldn't
have
to
go
to
20
percent;
suppose,
for
example,
you
started
looking
in
the
40
percents,
and
you
said,
you
know,
if
the
black
group
is
going
to
elect
their
candidate
with
40
percent,
or
45
percent
even,
they're
going
to
need
a
lot
of
crossovers,
because
they
may
only
vote
--
you
know,
only
80
percent
may
turn
out.
they
are
going
to
need
a
lot
of
crossovers.
and
the
more
crossovers
you
have
to
have,
the
harder
it
is
to
say
that
that
white
group
is
out
there
trying
to
beat
them.
so
there's
a
kind
of
natural
stopping
place.
when
i
worked
out
the
numbers,
it
seemed
that
natural
stopping
place
fell
around
42-43
percent.
it
sort
of
fell
--
as
you
said,
that
the
black
group
--
you
insist
that
the
black
group
had
to
be
twice
as
many
as
the
white
group
that
crossed
over.
a
little
arbitrary,
but
at
least
we
were
getting
to
the
same
--
to
the
right
thing.
i
mean
--
respond
as
you
wish.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
want
an
absolute,
arbitrary
rule,
which
is
what
you
were
heading
toward
which
will
just
--
the
question
is
whether
they
get
in
the
door.
if
they
are
in
the
door,
they
have
to
prove
the
three
factors.
and
you
want
to
keep
certain
people
out.
okay.
suppose
you
say,
well,
42
percent.
that
gives
you
down
to
40,
with
your
two
back,
instead
of
50.
but
you
are
out
anyway
if
the
crossover
vote
from
the
white
majority
is
more
than
half
of
what
the
whole
vote
is
with
the
black
and
white
together
on
that
side.
so
you
have
a
two-to-one
ratio.
now,
the
only
virtue
of
that
is
that
there
was
an
effort
to
try
to
get
an
arbitrary
rule,
which
you
have
with
your
50
percent,
even
--
only
a
little
bit
more
difficult
than
that
to
--
to
administer,
and
is
likely
to
get
in
more
cases
that
are
justified.
but
they
still
have
to
prove
their
three
factors.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
takes
into
account
the
realistic
fact
that
in
every
group,
including
lots
of
african-american
groups,
there
is
--
it
is
not
100
percent
african
american
at
all.
there
are
--
there
are
a
few
others
who
will
come
along,
and
--
and
that's
still
the
candidate
of
that
community's
choice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
want
--
a
little
flexibility
here
is
all
that
i'm
suggesting.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can't
get
below
42.
i'm
not
going
to
get
below
40
no
matter
what,
even
with
your
thumb
on
the
scale.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are
--
they
are
finished
at
40,
and
they
are
not
even
in
at
40,
if
they
have
to
depend
more
than
two-to-one
on
the
crossovers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
rule
i
suggested,
though
there
are
arbitrary
aspects
is
a
better
targeted,
more
administrable
--
or
equally
administrable
or
not
much
worse
administrable
arbitrary
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
must
be
somebody
there
to
get
you
over
50
percent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thirty-three
plus
11
is
44.
so
where
does
the
rest
come
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
40,
and
then
--
oh,
i
see,
39
plus
11.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
vote
cohesively.
