but
under
your
definition
of
coalition
district,
race
is
the
key
factor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
are
telling
us
if
we
have
a
rule
that
makes
race
the
key
factor
then
race
doesn't
matter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
you
were
proposing
a
brave
new
world
of
coalition
districts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
based
on
race.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
authority
that
says
you
must
consider
race
in
drawing
the
districts,
assuming
that
you
don't
have
an
existing
majority
--
minority-majority
district?
what's
the
--
what
authority
do
you
cite
for
the
fact
that
you
must
consider
race
in
drawing
districts?
what
do
i
read
to
find
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
that's
--
that's
a
majority
--
majority
district.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
so
then
what
other
case
do
you
have?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
your
statement
that
you
must
always
consider
race
in
drawing
districts
is
not
--
is
not
supported,
or
at
least
it's
a
new
proposition
that
you
are
arguing
for
us
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
something
new.
i
thought
we
took
the
case
--
at
least
i
have
been
thinking
about
the
case
--
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
valid
state
law
that
is
being
superseded.
now,
if
you
are
questioning
the
validity
of
the
state
law,
that's
something
--
that
hasn't
been
raised
here,
has
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about,
you're
indicating
to
us
that
the
county
line
standard
that
the
state
court
invoked
as
a
matter
of
state
law
is
itself
questionable
because
it
was
based
on
a
prohibited
racial
animus.
and
i
--
i
indicated
that
that's
very
new
to
me.
i
thought
we
were
taking
the
case
on
the
proposition
that
the
county
line
rule
is
a
neutral,
valid
state
law
principle.
now,
it
may
or
may
not
be
superseded
by
the
--
by
the
requirement
of
section
2.
that's
what
we
are
arguing
about.
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
that
we
have
to
somehow
question
the
underlying
state
rule
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
thought
we
took
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
state
rule
is
valid.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
the
county
line
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
intentional
by
those
who
draw
the
district?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
won
--
i'd
hoped
that
you
could
have
a
brief
time
to
discuss
your
third
rationale
because
it's
going
to
require
determination
of
how
people
would
vote.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
an
opinion
in
answering
the
judgment
of
the
court.
the
case
arises
under
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
section
2,
the
statute,
prohibits
practices
imposed
or
applied
by
any
state
or
political
subdivision
in
a
manner
which
results
in
a
denial
or
abridgment
of
the
right
of
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color.
it
is
accepted
law
that
section
2
can
sometimes
require
legislators
to
draw
a
district
where
a
minority
group
is
geographically
compact
and
would
constitute
a
numerical
majority
of
the
voting
age
population.
in
election
law
parlance,
that's
called
a
majority-minority
district.
today's
case
involves
a
different
kind
of
district,
a
so-called
crossover
district.
in
this
kind
of
district,
the
minority
population
is
not
itself
a
numerical
majority
of
the
voting
age
population.
and
it
can
elect
the
candidate
of
its
choice
only
with
the
help
from
white
crossover
voters.
the
question
here
in
this
case
is
whether
section
2
can
ever
require
the
creation
of
a
crossover
district.
when
the
north
carolina
general
assembly
redrew
its
districts
after
the
2000
census,
it
drew
house
district
18
for
the
state
general
assembly
to
split
pender
and
new
hanover
counties.
that
created
the
district
with
an
african-american
voting
age
population
of
39%,
a
larger
voting
minority
than
if
pender
county
had
not
been
split,
but
still
it
was
not
a
majority-minority
district.
pender
county
and
its
commissioners
filed
a
suit
against
north
carolina
state
officials.
they
alleged
that
district
18
violated
the
north
carolina
constitution,
which
prohibit
splitting
counties
to
draw
legislative
districts.
the
north
carolina
voting
officials
answered
that
keeping
pender
county
whole
and
not
creating
the
crossover
district
would
have
deluded
the
minority
groups
voting
strength
in
violation
of
section
2,
the
controlling
federal
law.
in
the
case
of
thornburg
versus
gingles,
this
court
established
three
threshold
requirements
for
section
2
liability
and
at
issue
here
is
the
first
so-called
gingles'
requirement.
and
it
is
that
the
minority
group
at
issue
be
sufficiently
large
and
geographically
compact
to
constitute
a
majority
in
a
single
member
district.
because
the
african-american
voting
age
population
in
district
18
is
only
39%,
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
held
that
state
officials
could
not
satisfy
the
first
gingles'
requirement.
the
state
supreme
court
ordered
them
to
redraw
the
district.
we
granted
certiorari.
and
today,
we
affirmed
the
state
supreme
court's
decision.
the
state
voting
officials
were
the
petitioners
in
this
court
argued
that
although
these
crossover
districts
do
not
include
a
numerical
majority
of
minority
voters,
they
nevertheless
satisfy
the
first
gingles'
requirement
because
they
are
effective
minority
districts.
we
conclude
the
petitioner's
theory
is
contrary
to
the
text
of
section
2
and
to
the
reasoning
of
our
cases
in
this
area.
allowing
crossover
district
claims
has
a
mandatory
requirement
under
the
statute
would
require
us
to
revise
and
reformulate
the
gingles'
threshold
inquiry
that
has
been
the
baseline
of
our
section
2
jurisprudence.
we
find
support
for
the
majority-minority
requirement
in
the
need
for
workable
standards
and
sound
judicial
and
legislative
administration.
the
rule
draws
clear
lines
for
courts
and
legislators
alike.
the
same
could
not
be
said
of
the
less
exacting
standard
that
would
mandate
crossover
districts
under
section
2.
applying
that
standard
would
place
courts
in
the
untenable
position
of
predicting
many
political
variables
and
tying
them
to
race-based
assumptions.
we
must
be
most
cautious
before
interpreting
the
statute
to
require
courts
to
make
inquiries
based
on
racial
classifications
and
race-based
predictions.
the
statutory
mandate
petitioners
urge
us
to
find
in
section
2
raises
serious
constitutional
questions.
heightening
these
concerns
is
the
fact
that
section
2
applies
nationwide
to
every
jurisdiction
that
must
draw
lines
for
election
districts
under
state
or
local
law.
crossover
district
claims
will
require
courts
to
make
predictive
political
judgments
not
only
about
familiar
two-party
contests
in
large
districts,
but
also
about
regional
and
local
jurisdictions
where
political
data
are
nonexistence
and
any
predictions
would
be
speculative
at
best.
given
the
text
of
section
2,
our
case
is
interpreting
that
provision
and
the
difficulty
of
assessing
section
2
claims
without
the
objective
guidance
of
the
majority-minority
rule.
it
is
no
surprise
that
every
federal
court
of
appeals
to
consider
the
question
has
interpreted
the
first
gingles'
factor
to
require
a
majority-minority
standard.
to
the
extent
there
is
any
doubt
where
the
section
2
calls
for
the
majority-minority
rule,
we
resolve
that
out
by
avoiding
serious
constitutional
concerns
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
which
permits
racial
classifications
only
as
the
last
resort.
if
section
2
were
interpreted
to
require
crossover
districts
throughout
the
nation,
it
would
unnecessarily
infuse
race
into
virtually
every
redistricting
and
would
result
in
a
substantial
increase
in
the
number
of
mandatory
districts
drawn
with
race
as
the
predominant
factor
motivating
a
legislator's
decision.
now,
although
we
hold
that
section
2
does
not
require
crossover
districts,
our
holding
does
not
affect
the
availability
of
such
districts
as
a
matter
of
legislative
choice.
section
2
allows
states
to
choose
their
own
method
of
complying
with
the
voting
rights
act
and
that
may
include
drawing
crossover
districts.
states
that
wish
to
draw
crossover
districts
are
free
to
do
so
where
no
other
prohibition
exists.
and
because
this
case
does
not
involve
allegations
of
intentional
and
wrongful
conduct,
our
holding
does
not
address
a
situation
in
which
a
state
intentionally
drew
district
lines
in
order
to
destroy
otherwise
effective
crossover
districts,
an
act
that
would
raise
serious
questions
under
both
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
racial
discrimination
and
racially
polarized
voting
are
not
ancient
history.
much
remains
to
be
done
to
ensure
that
citizens
of
all
races
have
equal
opportunity
to
share
and
participate
in
our
democratic
processes
and
traditions.
it
would
be
an
irony,
however,
if
section
2
were
interpreted
to
entrench
racial
differences
by
expanding
a
statute
meant
to
hasten
the
waning
of
racism
in
american
politics.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
is
affirmed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
ginsburg,
and
breyer
have
joined.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
