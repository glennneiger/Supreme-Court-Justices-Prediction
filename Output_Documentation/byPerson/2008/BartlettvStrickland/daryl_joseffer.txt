mr.
daryl
joseffer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
has
proposed
expansion
of
section
2's
traditional
coverage
because
of
three
serious
problems.
the
first
is
to
provide
state
and
local
legislatures,
as
well
as
the
courts,
with
a
baseline
against
which
to
when
a
section
2
district
must
be
drawn
in
the
first
place,
when
to
engage
in
this
race
conscious
exercise
in
the
first
place.
second,
it
raises
the
serious
constitutional
concerns
identified
in
lulac,
especially
because
it
combines
not
only
racial
gerrymandering
but
with
political-party
gerrymandering
all
at
the
same
time.
and
third,
it
requires
difficult
predictive
judgments
about
how
people
would
react,
how
people
would
vote
in
a
future
proposed
district,
something
that
is
not
required
under
the
traditional
gingles
analysis.
and
these
problems
would
exist
nationwide
because
section
2
applies
to
every
districting
done
in
every
jurisdiction
and
every
--
nationwide,
be
it
a
county,
city,
or
locality
or
down
to
the
school-board
or
town-council
level.
now,
under
the
first
of
those
points,
under
the
traditional
gingles
test,
the
scope
of
consideration
of
race
and
other
things,
as
well
as
the
majority
limit
of
the
districts
--
and
that
provides
an
--
an
easy
focal
point
that
anyone
drawing
a
district
knows.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
we
have
identified
two
narrow
exceptions,
neither
of
which
the
court
really
needs
to
reach
in
this
case.
the
first
is
an
inference
of
intentional
discrimination.
and
the
important
thing
there
is,
first,
that's
academic.
because
if
you
can
prove
intentional
discrimination,
you
can
proceed
with
a
constitutional
claim
under
section
2
and
not
add
anything
anyway.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
yes,
exactly.
and
there
--
the
point
here
is
because
it's
not
an
actualization
statute,
one
needs
a
baseline
to
determine
if
there
is
the
denial
of
an
equal
opportunity
to
elect.
and
if,
in
fact,
what
the
people
drawing
the
district
were
trying
to
do
was
to
deprive
the
minority
group
of
that
opportunity,
that
is
a
perfectly
good
alternative
baseline.
our
other
proposed
narrow
exception,
which
also
is
not
even
close
to
being
implicated
here,
is
basically
an
evidentiary
one:
that
there
are
those
cases
where,
when
you
are
trying
to
figure
out
whether
the
majority
population
is
above
50
percent,
you
may
not
be
sure
because
these
are
estimates.
they
are
very
reliable,
but
we
would
impose
about
a
two
percent
cushion
there
to
adjust
--
to
account
for
the
possibility
that
if
there
is
that
much
evidentiary
uncertainty,
it
makes
sense
to
have
a
--
for
purposes
of
that
test.
however--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
because
--
i
say
actually
the
opposite
because
--
well,
i
think
that
trying
to
determine
48percent
raises
no
more
difficulty
than
trying
to
determine
50
percent.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
there
is
--
there
is
a
slight
narrowing
of
the
--
of
the--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
in
--
in
practice
--
i
mean,
remember,
the
majority-minority
rule
has
been
followed
in
almost
every
jurisdiction
nationwide
for
more
than
two
decades,
and
so
far
i
have
seen
one
48
percent
case.
there
may
have
been
others,
but
there
--
there
don't
seem
to
have
been
very
many.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
there
--
there
are
a
couple
of
things.
the
first
is
that,
textually
speaking,
what
the
statute
refers
to
is
an
equal
opportunity
to
elect
the
--
the
representative
of
their
choice.
and
at
least
the
most
principal
blind
is
the
majority-minority
rule.
because
if
you
have
by
yourselves
the
majority
of
the
electorate,
you
have
at
least
in
theory
the
opportunity
to
elect
the
representative
of
your
choice.
when
you
go
beyond
that,
there
really
is
at
that
point--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--right.
but
that's--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--yes.
the
problem
is
once
you
go
below
what
is
at
least
in
principle
a
50
percent
line,
it's
not
clear
where
--
where
one
would
ever
stop.
and
under
your
approach,
i
think
two
exceptions:
one,
you
definitely
open
the
door
down
to
potentially
below
42,
especially
--
in
this
case,
especially--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--i
mean--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--one
problem
with
what
you
are
looking
for
is
a
principled
rule
that
can
be
justified.
i
understand
50,
and
i
understand
the
slight
evidentiary
cushion.
forty-two
really
does
--
from
what
you're
trying
to
determine
is
now
the
equal
opportunity
to
be
coming
out
of
nowhere.
the
other
advantage
the
50
percent
rule
has
is
the
advantages
of
incumbency.
in
effect,
it
has
been
a
case
that
has
been
litigated
for
more
than
two
decades
now.
and
that
has
shown
that,
first,
that
it's
workable;
and
second,
that
it
does
not
appear
to
have
left
some
gaping
hole
of
section
2's
coverage.
if
it
had,
congress
likely
would
have
--
statute
over
the
past
two
decades.
and
the
other
thing
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
under
gingles
one
typically
looks
at
what
actually
happened
in
the
past.
the
third
gingles
factor
looks,
for
example,
looks
to
whether
white
bloc
voting
in
actual
elections
has
generally
been
sufficient
to
prevent
the
election
of
minority
group's
candidate
of
choice
in
the
past.
so,
it's
a
straightforward
historic-based
inquiry.
here,
however,
the
state
or
local
legislature
at
the
outset
looking
to
trade
a
new
district
based
on
the
prediction
that
it
will
elect
the
minority
group's
candidate
of
choice.
so,
as
a
practical
matter,
you
start
with
the
racial
makeup
of
some
people
and
the
political
partisanship
of
others.
but
you
can't
stop
there,
because
you
have
to
predict
turnout
by
each
group,
crossover
voting
by
each
group.
as
a
practical
matter,
those
things
will
vary
based
on
who
the
candidates
are,
whether
there
is
an
incumbent,
whether
the
incumbent
is
the
minority
group's
candidate
of
choice.
and
especially
in
local
elections,
the
--
may
not
even
be
available,
which
was
a
point
that
was
made
in
the
topside
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
lawyers'
committee
for
civil
rights,
the
naacp
legal
defense
fund
and
others.
if
i
could
turn
to
the
constitutional
--
point.
in
that
perspective,
this
proposal
is
really
the
worst
of
all
worlds,
because
the
way
you
construct
a
district
is
to
take
some
people
based
on
race,
others
based
on
political
party
affiliation,
and
the
race
can't
dominate
and
the
majority
of
courts
have
also
held
purely
partisan
gerrymandering,
at
least
--
aside
is
also
unconstitutional.
but
this
is
both.
what
you
have
is
nationwide
in
every
jurisdiction,
every
districting
a
mandate
that
requires
consideration
for
both
race
and
partisanship
that
goes
far
beyond
what
has
traditionally
been
required
under
section
2
and
i
suspected
far
beyond
what
normally
happens
at
the
local
level.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i
think
the
easy
way
to
cut
through
is
that
a
state
supreme
court
respond
and
remand
all
arguments
other
than
the
first
gingles
factor.
so,
the
first
gingles
factor,
based
on
what
happened
in
the
state
supreme
court
is
the
only
thing
that
is
before
the
court.
what
would
remain
potentially
unremand
is
if
this
court
were
to
would
ban
the
traditional
understanding
of
the
first
gingles
factor
and
impose
a
new
understanding.
then
the
adjudication
of
that
might
be
open
on
remand.
but
respondents
have
remanded
everything
else
in
the
state
supreme
court.
finally,
i
also
can't
help
but
mention
that
there
is
a
great
irony
here
in
that
petitioners'
essential
position
is
that
back
when
race
relations
were
worse
and
back
when
there's
much
more
racial
bloc
voting,
minority-majority
districts
worked
okay.
but
now
that
race
relations
have
improved
and
there
is
much
more
crossover
voting,
we
should
now
require
greater
consideration
of
race
as
well
as
partisanship
than
had
ever
been
done
before
under
the
same
unamended
statute.
and
if
i
could
turn
--
justice's
--
at
the
outset,
a
state
or
local
legislature
as
well
as
the
court
really
doesn't
know
where
to
start.
state
and
local
legislatures
are
the
ones
who
are
supposed
to
be
drawing
these
lines.
that
means
they
need
to
be
clear
administrable
rules
to
follow.
and
the
simpler
they
are,
the
better
the
chance
we
will
have
to
do
it,
and
if
they
can
figure
it
out
at
the
outset,
the
less
consideration
of
race
and
partisanship
becomes
necessary.
and
the
50
percent
rule,
as
a
practical
matter,
has
worked
for
a
couple
of
decades
in
this
respect.
and
if
one
goes
beyond
that,
there
is
also
no
principle
stopping
point.
here's
39
percent,
which
doesn't
seem
close
to
me
or
under
justice
breyer's
rationale--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--there
are
two
things
about
the
graphs.
the
first
is
that
less
compact
maps
--
those
were
the
districts
that
would
determine
the
unconstitutional.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
right.
another
thing
there
seems
to
be
a
common
misconception
that
our
view
of
section
2
prohibits
the
drafting
of
crossover
districts,
which
is
not
case
of
all.
the
question
here
is
what
if
they
are
required.
if
a
district
--
if
a
jurisdiction
wants
to
draw
a
crossover
district,
then
at
least
in
principle
nothing
is
stopping
it
from
doing
so.
however,
if
what
you
were
to
do
was
require
the
drawing
these
crossover
districts,
that
could
create
some
funny
maps
of
its
own,
because
if
you
have
to
reach
out
to
grab
jurisdiction
wide,
look
at
every
significant
pocket
of
minority
voters,
look
at
whatever
you
could
put
together
that
would
vote
alike,
which
as
a
practical
matter
is
the
same
political
party,
then
you
are
going
to
be
requiring
the
same
dynamics
that
led
to
those
very
strange
maps
in
the
--
in
the
first
place.
