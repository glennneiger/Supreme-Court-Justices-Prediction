do
you
have
racially
polarized
voting
when
you
have
as
high
a
crossover
vote
as
40
percent?
i
mean,
you
say,
we
apply
the
normal
gingles
factors,
but
it
seems
to
me
40
percent
crossover
is
fairly
high.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
still
think
that
we
can
confidently
say
this
is
racially
polarized?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
--
what
you
propose
is
going
to
inject
courts
into
the
drawing
of
districts
much
more
frequently
than
they
--
than
they
already
are
injected.
the
reality
is
that
one
of
the
factors
--
you
mentioned
contiguousness
and
county
lines
and
so
forth,
but
one
of
the
factors
that
legislators
always
take
into
account
is
incumbent
protection
and
the
incumbent
is
always
going
to
rather
be
in
an
80
percent
district
than
in
a
so-called
40
percent
coalition
district.
i
think
you
are
unrealistic
to
expect
state
legislatures
to
draw
districts
that
way,
where
everybody
will
have
a
chance.
the
whole
object
of
it
is
that
nobody
will
have
a
chance,
just
the
incumbents.
that's
what
is
going
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine,
but
you
just
can't
wave
a
magic
wand.
it
--
congress
also
intended
primarily
to
leave
it
up
to
the
legislatures
under
guidelines,
to
be
sure.
and
when
you
have
a
choice
of
one
80
percent
or
two
or
even
three
40
percent,
it's
clear
to
me
what
the
legislature
is
going
to
--
going
to
choose.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
will
be
injected
into
this
very
political
game
much
more
frequently
than
we
now
are.
i
have
always
regarded
the
50
percent
gingles
thing
as
simply
a
self-protection
prescription
for
the
courts,
where
you
can
look,
you
can
be
clear
and
say,
you
know,
close
enough
for
government
work.
but
if
you
want
us
to
figure
out
whether
there
could
be
three
districts,
two
districts
instead
of
just
one
district,
you
are
just,
it
seems
to
me,
tossing
the
whole
--
the
whole
project
of
drawing
districts
into
the
courts.
and
that
is
--
that
is
not
something
that
i,
for
one,
favor.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry,
what
--
what's
the
color
of
the
brief
--
of
the
cover
on
this?
is
it
the
brown
one
or
the
white
one?
