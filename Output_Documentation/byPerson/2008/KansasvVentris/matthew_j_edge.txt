mr.
matthew
j.
edge
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
guess
i
have
basically
three
arguments
with
the
--
or
problems
with
the
state's
position
first
of
all,
what
we're
dealing
with
in
the
sixth
amendment
case
here
is
a
violation
of
a
core
enumerated
trial
right,
and
this
makes
it
a
very
different
animal
from
all
the
other
cases
that
we're
talking
about.
if
we're
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment,
we're
talking
about
something
that
isn't
a
trial
right.
it's
a
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
--
in
their
homes
and
possessions.
the
violation
occurs
when
the
police
commit
whatever
misconduct
makes
the
search
of
the
evidence
illegal.
but
the
use
of
that
evidence
at
trial
doesn't
work
any
further
constitutional--
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
--yes,
he
was.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
no,
i
don't
think
so.
the--
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
--no.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
no,
the
--
i
don't
know
exactly
the
day
that
this
happened.
i
do
know
that
he
was
arrested
on
the
16th
of
january,
2004,
and
there
was
a
search
of
his
cell
on
january
20th.
and
we
know
from
that
testimony
that
why
that's
relevant
is
that
he
was
cellmates
with
mr.
doser
by
that
time,
and
mr.
doser
testifies
that
he
was
the
cellmate
of
mr.
ventris
for
2
days.
and
on
the
second
day,
mr.
ventris
supposedly
made
these
statements.
so
my
best
guess
is
that
the
--
this
conversation
occurred
sometime
between
the
17th
and
the
20th.
now,
the
order
of
appointing
counsel
is
entered
on
january
21st,
and
counsel
doesn't
enter
his
appearance
until
january
27th.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
i
believe
this
is
that,
as
long
as
there's
some
kind
of
incentive
for
the
prosecutor
to
use
informants
in
this
manner,
then
the
only
--
then
even
if
they're
not
usable
in
the
case-in-chief,
there's
still
an
incentive
to
use
this
kind
of
evidence,
and
the
prosecutor
and
the
police
will
attempt
to
obtain
it.
there's
simply
very
little
downside.
the
prosecutor
instructs
the
informant
not
to
deliberately
elicit
the
statement.
the
prosecutor
is
still
responsible
for
the
informant
because
the
informant
is
his
agent,
so
even
if
--
when
the
informant
goes
ahead
and
deliberately
elicits
the
statement,
it's
still
a
constitutional
violation.
but
so
long
as
you
allow
it
for
some
kind
of
purpose,
then
there
isn't
a
deterrent
effect,
and--
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
--i
mean,
i
guess,
maybe
i'm
confused.
there's
a
deterrent
--
there
is
a
deterrent
effect
from
suppressing
it
in
the
case-in-chief,
but
it's
not
sufficient
unless
it's
also
extended
to
use
in
rebuttal
as
well.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
no,
your
honor.
what
i'm
attempting
to
deter
is
the
sort
of
up-ending
of
the
adversarial
system
that
this
represents.
there
was
a
question
that
was
presented
earlier
about
when
does
this
violation
occur.
and
i
think
that
gets
to
the
manner
of
--
the
nature
of
the
sixth
amendment
violation.
and
our
contention
is
that
the
violation
occurs
when
the
statement
is
extracted,
and
then
it's
further
aggravated
when
it's
used
at
trial.
when
the
police
obtain
these
kinds
of
statements,
even
if
they're
not
used
at
trial,
it
does
work
a
harm
on
the
defendant
and
his
relationship
with
counsel.
it
affects
defendant's--
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
--i
do
not,
your
honor.
and
i'm
really
at
a
loss
to
speculate
as
to
why
that
would
be.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
it
would
be
a
very
different
rule.
i
think
the
only
rule
that
this
would
be
the
case
so
far
is
in
portash
with
the
self-incrimination
clause.
we're
saying
that
the
same
type
of
rule
should
apply
to
the
sixth
amendment.
otherwise,
no,
that's
correct,
whenever
you're
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment
or
one
of
the
prophylactic
rules
like
miranda
or
jackson,
then
they
are
admissible
for
impeachment
purposes.
what
makes
this
case
different
is
that
it
--
it
involves
a
violation
of
an
enumerated
constitutional
trial
right.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
well,
in
--
i
think
one
of
the
complicating
factors
here,
your
honor,
is
that
the
state
in
this
particular
case
didn't
try
a
straightforward
interrogation.
they
sent
in
an
undercover
informant.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
i
don't
know
whether
he
had
asked
for
a
lawyer
or
not.
i
know
that
he
was
entitled
to
one
at
the
time,
and
one
would
be
appointed
for
him.
but
otherwise--
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
certainly
can
be
a
coercive
atmosphere
even
if
you're
not
talking
to
a
known
police
agent.
now,
those
aren't
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
and
there
is
no
claim
that
the
statement
was
involuntary.
however,
one
of
the
advantages
of
speaking
to
known
police
officers
is
that
a
defendant
can
simply
end
the
interrogation
by
invoking
his
right
to
counsel,
and
that
is
not
necessarily
a
course
of
action
that's
available
to
him
if
he
thinks
he's
merely
talking
to
a
cellmate,
somebody
who
--
whether
he
wants
to
speak
to
him
or
not,
he's
going
to
be
in
the
cell
with
him
for
some
time.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
your
honor,
i
think
it
goes
to
the
nature
of
the
harm
that
comes
from
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
the
sixth
amendment
simply
doesn't
limit
itself
to
the
trial.
the
exact
wording
of
the
--
the
constitutional
provision
is
in
all
criminal
prosecutions
and
it
talks
about--
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
--well,
because
the
harm
isn't
something
that
just
affects
the
outcome
of
the
trial,
it
also
affects
--
it
affects
the
litigation
in
a
much,
much
deeper
way.
it
affects
counsel's
trial
strategy.
it
affects
a
defendant's
decision
whether
or
not
to
testify.
it
also--
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
--not
necessarily.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
yes,
your
honor,
in
some
contexts
it
would.
i
think
one
of
the
underlying
assumptions
of
the
state's
argument
in
this
with
regard
to
perjury
is
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
prior
inconsistent
statement
is
necessarily
indicative
of
perjury,
and
we
know
that
there
are
many
reasons
why
a
defendant
may
have
given
a
prior
inconsistent
statement.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
in
some
cases,
it
will
be
possible
for
counsel
to
vigorously
cross-examine
the
informant.
in
others,
it
may
not.
but
in
addition
to
that,
your
honor,
i
would
also
say
that
it
doesn't
simply
affect
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
go
to
trial
or
whether
or
not
to
testify
at
trial.
it
also
affects
the
litigation
in
a
very
deep
way,
inasmuch
as
a
defendant
is
burdened
in
trying
to
negotiate
a
favorable
plea
deal.
every
statement
or
every
piece
of
evidence
that
the
state
has
affects
their
willingness
to
plea
bargain,
and
when
the
state
obtains
this
kind
of
evidence
illegally,
it
puts
the
defendant
in
a
bind
for
--
puts
their
counsel
in
a
bind.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
it
would,
your
honor,
inasmuch
as
it
would
remove
any
disincentive
for
the
police
to
obtain
this
evidence
by
this
manner
in
the
first
place.
so
there
would
be
that
marginal
deterrent
factor.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
i
think
they
would
be
largely
the
same,
your
honor.
the
difference
would
be
in
the
interests
protected.
the
self-incrimination
clause
in
the
fifth
amendment
is
aimed
primarily
at
the
coercion
of
the
defendant;
whereas,
the
sixth
amendment
aims
primarily
at
the
preservation
of
an
adversarial
process,
that
relationship
between
counsel
and
his
attorney.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
matthew
j.
edge
yes,
you
could,
your
honor.
also,
you
could
have
it
as
part
of
the
pretrial
suppression
hearings.
i
would
anticipate
that
even
if
the
--
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
our
position,
these
kinds
of
sixth
amendment
cases
are
still
going
to
be
litigated.
the
issue
is
simply
going
to
be
whether
or
not
the
--
the
states
--
or
the
police
agent
is
deliberately
eliciting
the
statement
or
not.
so
there
--
there's
likely
going
to
be
some
kind
of
pretrial
litigation
regarding
the
admissibility
of
the
statements,
and
it
could
be
handled
at
that
time.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court,
i'll
yield
my
remaining
time.
