when
does
--
when
does
the
sixth
amendment
violation
occur?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
--
do
we
have
any
other
situation
in
which,
for
purposes
of
impeaching
testimony,
a
constitutional
violation
is
allowed?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
parallel
to
the
fifth.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
saharsky,
i'm
--
i'm
still
a
little
hung
up
on
--
on
whether
we
would
be
allowing
a
constitutional
violation.
general
mcallister
said
that
in
the
fifth
amendment
area,
we
--
we
indeed
allow
--
allow
it
to
be
introduced
in
rebuttal
even
though
that
is
the
actual
constitutional
violation.
is
that
the
case
other
than
in
the
miranda
situation?
i
mean,
suppose
you
have
a
generally
coerced
confession.
would
we
--
would
we
permit
that
to
go
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
well,
why
--
why
is
not
that
the
case
with
the
--
the
right
to
counsel?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
its
real
meaning
is
that
counsel
is
guaranteed
at
trial.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
its
root
purpose
is
that
counsel
is
guaranteed
at
trial.
and
here
we're
saying
it's
okay
not
to
have
counsel
at
trial
so
long
as
it's
refuting
a
lie
by
the
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
that
--
you
say
the
sixth
amendment
violation
occurs
before
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
kansas.
rhonda
theel
and
the
respondent
here,
donnie
ray
ventris
robbed
one
ernest
hicks
in
his
home.
in
the
course
of
the
crime,
one
or
both
of
them
shot
and
killed
hicks.
the
state
charged
both
with
murder,
burglary,
and
robbery.
before
ventris's
trial,
police
officers
planted
an
informant
in
his
cell
with
the
instructions
to
listen
for
incriminating
statements.
apparently,
the
informant
did
a
bit
more
than
merely
listen.
and
in
response
to
some
prodding,
ventris
admitted
that
he
had
shot
and
robbed
hicks.
the
prodding
violated
the
sixth
amendment
which
we
have
held
prohibits
deliberate
elicitation
of
inculpatory
statements
from
uncounseled
defendant's
postindictment.
at
trial,
ventris
took
the
stand
and
blamed
both
robbery
and
the
shooting
on
theel,
asserting
that
he
did
not
know
his
companion's
intentions
when
they
went
to
the
victim's
home.
in
response
to
this
testimony,
the
state
sought
over
ventris's
objection
to
have
the
informant
testify
to
ventris's
prior
contradictory
statement.
the
state
conceded
that
the
informant
had
deliberately
elicited
the
inculpatory
statement
in
violation
of
ventris's
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
but
argued
that
the
statement
was
nevertheless
admissible
for
impeachment
purposes.
that
is
to
undermine
ventris's
testimony.
the
trial
court
allowed
the
informant's
testimony
and
the
jury
convicted
ventris
on
counts
of
aggravated
burglary
and
aggravated
robbery
but
acquitted
him
on
the
murder
charge.
the
kansas
supreme
court
reversed
the
convictions,
holding
that
the
informant's
statements
were
not
admissible
for
any
reason
including
impeachment.
we
granted
certiorari.
whether
a
confession
that
was
not
admissible
in
the
prosecution's
case-in-chief,
can
nonetheless
be
admitted
for
impeachment
purposes,
depends
on
the
nature
of
a
constitutional
guarantee
that
has
been
violated.
the
fifth
amendment
guarantee
against
compelled
self-incrimination
for
example
is
violated
by
introducing
a
coerced
confession
at
trial,
which
means
it
simply
cannot
be
used
whether
by
way
of
impeachment
or
otherwise.
but
for
other
constitutional
guarantees
such
as
the
fourth
amendment
guarantee
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
which
is
violated
when
the
search
or
seizure
occurs
and
for
certain
prophylactic
rules
developed
under
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments,
we
have
held
that
exclusion
comes
by
way
of
deterrent
sanction
for
the
prior
constitutional
violation,
rather
than
to
avoid
violation
of
the
substantive
guarantee
at
trial.
admissibility
in
such
cases
is
determined
by
an
exclusionary-rule
balancing
test.
the
core
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
indeed
a
right
to
be
enjoyed
at
trial,
but
we
have
held
that
the
right
extends
to
govern
police
conduct
at
certain
critical
stages
prior
to
trial.
whenever
the
assistance
of
counsel
is
denied
at
one
of
these
pretrial
critical
stages,
such
as
the
one
here
when
--
when
a
confession
was
--
was
sought
to
be
obtained
by
the
police,
whenever
assistance
of
counsel
was
denied,
the
defendant's
constitutional
right
is
infringed
at
that
time,
not
when
evidence
is
later
admitted
at
trial.
the
earlier
deprivation
demands
the
remedy
of
exclusion
from
the
prosecution's
case-in-chief
but
its
admissibility
for
impeachment
is
subject
to
the
balancing
test.
on
one
side
of
the
balance,
when
the
defendant
has
taken
the
stand
to
lie
is
the
cause
of
denying
a
prosecution
the
traditional
truth
testing
devices
of
the
adversary
process.
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance
is
the
deterrence
which
that
denial
will
provide
against
such
violations
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
the
future.
but
in
fact,
preventing
the
impeachment
would
provide
little
incremental
deterrence
since
officers
already
have
strong
incentive
to
comply
with
the
constitution
in
order
to
make
the
defendant's
statements
admissible
in
the
prosecution's
case-in-chief.
in
every
other
context,
this
court
has
held
that
tainted
evidence
excluded
from
the
prosecution's
case-in-chief
is
admissible
for
impeachment
and
no
distinction
here
alters
that
balance.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
