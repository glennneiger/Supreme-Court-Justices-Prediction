mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
has
always
held
that
a
defendant's
voluntary
statements
obtained
in
violation
of
constitutional
standards
may
be
used
for
impeachment
purposes
when
the
defendant
testifies
at
trial.
the
court
has
excluded
statements
for
all
purposes
only
when
they
are
involuntary
or
have
been
compelled.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
voluntary
statements
obtained
in
violation
of
the
rule
of
massiah
v.
united
states
should
be
treated
differently
than
all
other
voluntary
statements.
the
answer
is
no
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first,
permitting
the
impeachment
use
of
voluntary
statements
obtained
in
violation
of
constitutional
standards
is
necessary
to
prevent
perjury
by
criminal
defendants.
second,
in
terms
of
the
effect
at
trial,
there's
no
basis
for
distinguishing
a
voluntary
statement
obtained
in
violation
of
the
massiah
rule
from
fourth
amendment
violations,
miranda
violations,
or
violations
of
the
rule
of
michigan
v.
jackson.
in
all
of
those
situations
the
resulting
evidence
may
limit
defense
counsel's
options
at
trial,
but
there's
no
basis
in
that
respect
for
distinguishing
a
massiah
violation.
it
has
no
different
effect
than
those
others.
also,
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
does
not
include
a
right
to
commit
perjury
or
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
in
presenting
false
testimony.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
that
question,
your
honor,
as
you
realize,
is
debated
a
bit
in
the
briefs.
it's
--
kansas,
for
purposes
of
deciding
this
case,
is
willing
to
accept
the
position
of
the
united
states
and
the
respondent
that
it
occurs
when
the
statement
is
admitted
at
trial,
although
the
cases
have
not
necessarily
definitively
resolved
that
question.
we,
frankly,
think
it's
unnecessary
to
answer
the
question
because
it's
a
minimal
point
in
terms
of
potential
deterrent
--
deterrents
that
operate
in
this
setting--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--well,
that's
the
--
that's
one
of
the
intricacies
of
--
of
this
particular
question,
although
arguably
in
the
--
in
the
fifth
amendment
context
certainly,
the
miranda
warnings
are
given.
the
police
don't
do
that.
and
--
and
if
that
is
the
completion
of
the
violation,
it's
--
it's
analogous
in
many
ways,
if
one
looks
back
at
the
cases.
the
court
has
suggested
that
the
actual
violation
is
the
use
of
the
statement
at
trial
against
the
defendant,
not
simply
obtaining
it
without
the
necessary
warnings
being
given.
so
we
would
argue
that
is,
in
fact--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--it's
parallel
to
the
fifth
in
this
respect,
and
certainly,
distinct
from
the
fourth
in
that
respect.
but
we
don't
think
it
matters
at
the
end
of
the
day.
if
--
if
one
were
to
treat
it
like
the
fourth
amendment,
so
that
the
violation
is
complete
when
the
police
send
in
an
informant
and
he
works
hard
to
elicit
statements
in
violation
of
the
messiah
rule,
if
it's
complete
at
that
time,
then
all
of
the
analysis
from
the
fourth
amendment
cases
is
equally
applicable
here.
if
the
violation
does
not
incur
--
occur
until
it's
presented
at
trial,
then
it's
analogous
more
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
also
to
the
michigan
v.
jackson
and
michigan
v.
harvey
cases,
which
were
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
violation,
in
which
case
the
court
says
it
was
wrong
for
the
police
to
initiate
interrogation
after
he
had
invoked
his
rights,
but
will
let
the
statement
be
admitted
for
impeachment
purposes.
so
it's
exactly
analogous
to
what
the
court
did
in
harvey
itself.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that
is
correct
if
--
if
it's
for
example,
an
undercover
officer,
someone
has
gone
in
--
and
in
fact,
there
are
cases
such
as
weatherford
v.
bursey
that
involved
an
undercover
agent
who
was
present
for
meetings
with
the
defendant
and
his
counsel,
and
the
court
indicated
that
the
presence
alone
would
not
violate
the
right
to
counsel.
it's
the
deliberate
elicitation
and
use
of
statements
obtained
from
the
defendant
that
would
violate
the
sixth
amendment.
so
if
a
--
a
cellmate,
another
defendant,
is
the
informant
who
listens
and
hears,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
under
the
court's
cases
if,
in
fact,
it
was
a
police
officer
pretending
to
be
a
cellmate
who
listens
and
hears,
just
as
it
wouldn't
make
--
it
wouldn't
be
a
violation
if
there
were
a
recording
device
in
the
cell
and
the
defendant
talked
to
himself,
which
there
are
cases
of
that,
and
it
was
picked
up
on
the
recording
device.
the
mere
listening
--
that
goes
to
whether
there's
a
violation
at
all.
but
the
who,
there
is
--
it
wouldn't
matter
for
our
purposes.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
potentially,
yes.
but,
again,
the
--
the
violation
would
go
to
what
happens
in
the
cell.
so
if
the
police
officer
is
pretending
to
be
another
defendant
and
sits
in
the
cell
and
the
defendant
starts
telling
the
officer
things,
that
would
not
violate
the
sixth
amendment
at
all
under
the--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--there
is
certainly
testimony
about
what
he
was
told
to
do
and
what
he
did.
it
does
not
suggest
aggressive
efforts,
certainly,
to
find
out.
he
may
not
have
been
completely
silent,
but
he
certainly
didn't
say,
tell
me
what
you
did,
let's
talk
about
your
crimes.
but
he
did
make
one
arguably
suggestive
statement
to
the
defendant.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
no,
not
that
he
could
affirmatively
elicit.
that's
the
dividing
line
between
the
massiah
and
kuhlmann
case.
if
he
was
in
the
cell
--
well,
i
guess
what
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
--outside
of
--
well,
it
would
still
be
admissible
for
impeachment.
and
we're
asking
for
basically
the
same
rule.
so
it
would
be
the
same
thing
if
he
were
in
the
cell,
deliberately
elicits,
knows
he's
violating
massiah,
it
couldn't
be
used
in
the
government's
case-in-chief,
but
it
could
be
used
for
impeachment
purposes.
but
that
would
be
true
of
miranda.
if
the
officer
deliberately
failed
to
give
the
warnings,
got
a
statement,
they
would
not
be
admissible
in
the
case-in-chief;
but
--
the
court
cases
are
very
clear
--
they
would
be
admissible
for
impeachment
purposes.
so
we're
asking
for
the
precise
parallel
rule.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
there
may
be
distinctions,
and
--
and
there
is
an
distinction
in
the
text
of
the
fifth
amendment
--
suggests
actually
a
rule
of
exclusion
when
you
truly
have
--
when
there
truly
is
a
compelled
statement.
and
the
court
has
recognized
that
in
cases
such
as
portash,
where
the
--
the
witness
is
given
use
immunity,
testifies
before
the
grand
jury
and
the
government
later
tries
to
use
it
against
him.
the
court
says,
no,
you
cannot
use
that
testimony
for
any
purpose.
so
there
is
a
difference
between
the
sixth
amendment
and
fifth
amendment
in
that
respect.
but
what
i
was
suggesting
is
the
way
massiah
and
miranda
operate
is
similar
in
this
context,
that
a
violation
results
in
suppression
of
the
evidence
from
the
government's
case-in-chief,
but
it
remains
available
for
use
as
impeachment.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
well,
with
all
due
respect
to
that
argument,
your
honor,
we
disagree
with
that.
there
are
strong
incentives
for
the
police,
frankly,
not
to
do
this.
and
in
part
one
of
the
reasons
--
well,
there's
two.
one
is
the
police
know
if
this
is
truly
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment,
then
nothing
can
be
used
in
the
case-in-chief.
so,
at
most,
it
is
impeachment
if
the
defendant
testifies
and
if
the
defendant
testifies
inconsistently
with
whatever
is
elicited.
but
furthermore,
given
the
line
the
court
has
drawn
between
massiah
and
kuhlmann
and
what
goes
on
with
the
informant
in
the
cell,
if
they
can
hear
the
statements
without
deliberately
eliciting
them,
if
you
will,
if
the
informant
is
present,
the
defendant
wants
to
talk,
starts
chatting,
they
discuss
the
crime,
those
statements,
the
court
has
held
in
kuhlmann,
are
admissible
for
all
purposes,
because
they
are
not
a
sixth
amendment
violation
at
all.
so,
the
police
do
have
some
--
some
strong
incentives
to
actually
try
to
gather
the
evidence,
if
they're
going
to,
in
a
way
that
makes
it
usable
in
the
prosecution's
case-in-chief.
there's
much
less
value
to
having
it
solely
for
impeachment,
which
is
always
going
to
be
speculative
if
it
would
ever
going
to
be
used.
it
would
depend
on
if
the
defendant
testifies
and
if
he
testifies
inconsistently
with
what
he
has
told
an
informant.
and
in
that
regard,
there
are
other
deterrents
i'd
like
to
mention
here
as
well.
the
informant
in
this
case,
for
example,
in
jail
recognized
that
he
did
not
want
to
be
an
aggressive
questioner
or
--
or
obvious
as
a
government
agent.
in
fact,
he
said,
i
didn't
really
want
to
ask
him
questions
because
i
was
afraid
if
he
felt
i
was
being
too
nosey,
i
might
get
hurt.
and
so,
the
informants
have
their
own
incentives
to
be
careful
here.
and
in
this
case,
it's
also
important
to
remember
that
deterrence
is
simply
one
side
of
the
balance.
and
the
court
has
said
many
times
even
if
there
would
be
some
deterrent
effect
to
extending
the
rule
to
include
impeachment,
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
whether
it
should,
in
fact,
be
excluded.
that
still
must
be
weighed
against
the
costs
on
the
other
side.
and
the
court
has
numerous
cases
emphasizing
the
costs
that
are
present
on
the
other
side
of
this
case.
perjury
by
criminal
defendants
is
a
primary
one,
but
also
cases
talking
about
the
importance
of
allowing
the
jury
to
hear
the
truth
and
to
search
for
truth.
the
jury
here
gets
to
evaluate
and
did,
i
would
argue,
quite
effectively
from
mr.
ventris'
standpoint,
evaluate
the
informant's
credibility.
the
jury
was
--
was
informed,
cross-examination
of
the
informant's
circumstances,
what
benefit
he
received,
who
he
was,
all
--
all
the
things
they
might
want
to
know
in
deciding
whether
to
believe
him.
his
testimony
went
not
solely
but
primarily
to
the
question
of
who
was
the
shooter
in
the
murder
in
the
case,
and
the
jury
acquitted
mr.
ventris
of
the
murder
charge.
so
they
did
not
believe,
at
least
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
he
in
fact
was
the
shooter.
and
that
is
precisely
how
this
should
work.
we're
not
saying
informants
are
always
100
percent
reliable,
but
we're
saying
the
court
has
a
long
tradition,
the
country
has
a
long
tradition
of
putting
this
evidence
in
front
of
a
jury.
it's
tested
by
crossexamination,
knowledge
of
what
the
incentives
are,
bringing
that
out
in
front
of
the
jury,
and
then
the
jury
decides.
there
are
many
of
these
cases
where
it's
--
this
was
a
typical,
one
codefendant
saying,
he
was
the
shooter,
the
other
defendant
saying,
no,
she
was
the
shooter.
and
the
informant
simply
had
information
that
was
relevant
to
the
credibility.
and
that's
the
way
it
was
used
in
this
case,
was
as
impeachment
on
rebuttal
to
evaluate
mr.
ventris's
testimony
and
whether
the
jury
believed
him
or
not.
the
other
thing
i
would
remind
the
court
is
we
are
simply
saying
that
the
rule
should
be
no
exclusion
under
the
sixth
amendment
for
impeachment
purposes,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
normal
rules
of
evidence
and
other
rules
of
trial
procedure
do
not
apply.
they
do.
and
they
might
well
result
in
the
exclusion
of
some
potential
informant's
testimony.
so
if
the
government
were
to
want
to
put
on
an
informant
who
had
been
convicted
many
times
of
perjury
and
the
judge
said,
no,
i
just
do
not
think
this
evidence
is
credible
enough
to
even
put
in
front
of
the
jury,
not
this
person,
the
ordinary
rules
of
evidence
and
trial
procedure
would
operate.
furthermore,
as
happened
in
this
case,
the
judge
can,
and
often
will,
give
cautionary
instructions,
limiting
instructions.
all
of
that
remains
appropriate.
but
there's
simply
no
reason
to
exclude
the
evidence
as
a
matter
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
it
would
be
inconsistent,
frankly,
with
--
with,
really,
the
general
tone
and
holdings
of
the
cases
in
the
--
in
the
fourth
amendment,
miranda,
and
even
sixth
amendment
territory,
including
primarily
michigan
v.
harvey
and
nix
v.
williams.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
two
quick
points
by
way
of
rebuttal.
the
balancing
of
the
interests
here
is
sprinkling
water
under
the
bridge
even
in
the
sixth
amendment
context.
in
both
nix
v.
williams
and
michigan
v.
harvey
where
the
court
was
dealing
with
sixth
amendment
interests
and
--
and
sixth
amendment
right-to-counsel
violations,
both
of
those
cases
make
clear
that
the
question
of
what
exclusionary
effect
to
give
a
violation
is
subject
to
a
balancing
analysis.
and
that's
what
we're
asking
for
here.
that's
why
it's
treated
for
these
purposes
like
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
miranda
context.
and
nix
itself,
to
paraphrase
the
court,
makes
a
fundamental
point
which
i
think
illustrates
how
this
works,
and
it
worked
effectively
to
defendant's
advantage
in
this
case.
in
nix
v.
williams,
the
court
said
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
--
and
i'm
paraphrasing
slightly
--
protects
against
unfairness
by
assuring
an
adversary
process
in
which
proffered
evidence
is
tested
by
crossexamination.
and
it's
done
in
front
of
a
jury.
it
is
not
about
requiring
the
exclusion
of
entire
categories
of
witnesses
or
types
of
evidence
for
all
purposes.
so
the
right
to
counsel
was
exercised.
it
was
exercised
effectively
in
this
case
when
mr.
doser
was
strongly
cross-examined
by
defense
counsel.
mr.
stephen
r.
mcallister
it
could,
your
honor.
i
realize
a
logical
extension
is
you
could
say
just
test
all
of
it.
but
that's
where
the
--
the
police
here
and
the
prosecutor
paid
the
price
of
the
way
in
which
the
evidence
was
obtained.
it's
excluded
from
the
government's
case-in-chief.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
we
would
respectfully
ask
that
this
court
reverse
the
decision
below.
