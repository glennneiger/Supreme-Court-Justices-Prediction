it
would
make
no
difference,
i
take
it,
general
mcallister,
if
this
had
been
a
police
officer
who
was
pretending
to
be
a
cellmate.
in
this
case
it
was
a
snitch,
but
it
could
be
the
police
officer
doing
inside
the
cell
what
he
couldn't
do
outside.
that
is,
the
police
officer
outside
who
wants
to
interrogate
must
inform
the
arrestee
of
his
miranda
rights,
but
inside
the
cell,
the
police
could
pretend
to
be
a
jailbird
and
they
can
--
can
get
the
information
that
way.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
the
police
know
that
they
--
they
can
get
around
the
clear
prohibition
on
their
questioning
without
miranda
warnings
by
pretending
to
be
a
jailbird.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i'm
--
i'm
assuming
we're
not
in
the
area
where
the
jail
mate
is
--
is
simply
passive.
in
--
in
this
case,
the
--
the
jail
mate
made
a
statement
that
encouraged
the
defendant.
he
wasn't
just
passive.
he
was
encouraging
the
defendant
to
speak.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
anyway,
your
answer
is
that
a
police
officer
could
affirmatively
elicit
testimony?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
--
you're
talking
about
impeachment
only.
we're
not
talking
about
the
case-in-chief.
so
if
the
police
--
he
can't
--
outside,
when
he
questions
the
defendant
and
gives
no
miranda
warnings,
that's
inadmissible.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
--
you're
making
no
distinction,
then,
between
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
argument
that
essentially
this
is
like
taking
a
pretrial
deposition,
only
one
side
isn't
represented?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
really
verifiable?
do
police
officers
who
engage
snitches,
do
they
get
disciplined,
especially
if
they
are
then
able
to
accomplish
what
was
accomplished
here?
that
is,
the
--
the
testimony
--
the
snitch
is
then
able
to
testify
after
the
defendant
testifies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
the
federal
level,
is
there
anything
one
way
or
another,
any
manual
that
instructs
a
u.s.
attorney
about
the
use
of
snitches
to
extract
confessions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
do
know
that
unlike
the
police
giving
miranda
warnings,
there's
no
warning
here
at
all.
i
mean,
he
thinks
he's
talking
to
a
cellmate.
nobody
tells
him,
remember,
you've
got
a
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel,
and
he's
essentially
giving
a
statement
without
the
miranda
warnings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
other
side
says
well,
practically
the
defendant
is
much
more
likely
to
say
something
that's
really
involuntary
when
he's
confronting
police
officers
--
that
the
reason
that
we
exclude
in
the
case
of
a
police
officer
is
the
intimidating
setting
when
the
defendant
is
in
the
police
station
or
in
the
cell
and
there
are
these
police
officers.
now
he
thinks
he's
just
with
a
cellmate,
so
there
isn't
--
there
isn't
the
coercive
atmosphere
that
there
is
when
the
police
do
the
questioning.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
urged
a
--
a
fall-back
position.
you
said
at
least
there
should
be
a
determination
by
the
judge
that
the
defendant
intentionally
testified
falsely.
and
i
was
wondering
how
that
would
operate.
you're
here
in
the
--
the
heat
of
the
trial,
and
the
prosecutor
says,
i
want
to
call
snitch
so-and-so.
and
then
what
do
we
do?
just
interrupt
the
trial
and
have
kind
of
a
mini-trial
to
test
the
credibility
of
--
of
the
informant?
