justice
stephen
g.

wasn't
this
individual
represented
by
counsel?
was
he
represented
by
counsel?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he
was
represented
by
counsel
at
the
time
that
the
informant
took
the
statement,
got
the
statement
elicited.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
my
memo
that
i
haven't
looked
through
carefully,
but
i'd
be
quite
interested.
i
--
i
thought
he
asked
for
counsel.
he
was
given
counsel.
subsequent
to
that,
this
statement
was
elicited.
i'd
like
to
know
that
because
the
sixth
amendment
says
you
have
a
right
to
assistance
of
counsel
in
your
defense.
period.
and
i
guess,
if
he
had
a
lawyer,
the
lawyer
could
have
told
him,
don't
talk
to
informants
in
the
jailhouse.
he
could
have
said,
i'm
going
to
talk
to
who
i
want.
or
he
might
not
have.
but
i'd
be
interested
in
knowing,
did
he
have
assistance
of
counsel
at
the
time
the
statement
was
elicited?
it's
one
thing
to
me
if
he
did;
another
if
he
didn't.
don't
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
can
i
find
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
might
be
he
asked
for
counsel
but
hadn't
yet
received
counsel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
see
the
problem.
i
wonder
if
you
have
an
answer
to
another
question.
you
may
not.
i
can't
find
it.
it
seems
to
me
it's
been
20
years
since
this
--
nearly
20
--
since
the
court
decided
the
michigan
case.
the
other
cases
were
decided
even
earlier.
and
it's
just
surprising
to
me
that
it's
never
come
up
or
rarely,
rarely
come
up,
the
--
the
question
of
whether
the
--
the
state
can
introduce
into
evidence
a
--
a
statement
made
when
the
state
questioned
an
individual
who'd
asked
for
counsel
or
had
counsel
out
of
the
presence
of
the
counsel.
i
mean,
does
that
normally
happen,
or
does
it
never
happen?
why
is
there
so
little
law
on
it?
have
you
any
idea?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i'm
not
certain
about.
and
this
is
why
i
--
i've
been
asking
these
questions.
what
i
can't
figure
out
in
my
own
mind
is
this.
i
ask
for
a
lawyer.
the
state
has
some
period
of
time
to
give
me
a
lawyer.
now,
it's
one
thing
if
what's
going
on
is
once
i
ask
for
a
lawyer,
the
state
should
deal
with
me
through
my
lawyer.
that's
how
they're
supposed
to
do
it.
but
that
isn't
as
basic
--
that's
like
a
rule
of
ethics
in
most
states
in
the
civil
context
and
other
contexts.
that's
not
as
basic
as
if
i
ask
for
a
lawyer,
and
then
the
state
just
doesn't
give
me
one,
though
it
should.
that's
a
different
violation,
a
different
kind
of
violation.
one
is
a
kind
of
a
rule
of
ethics
incorporated
in
the
constitution.
the
second
is
what
the
cases
--
is
what
the
constitution
is
really
about,
give
him
a
lawyer
when
he
asks
for
one.
and
which
is
this
case?
that's
why
i'm
having
hard
time.
is
it
the
first
or
the
second?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
but
that
--
that
--
i
mean,
i'll
amalgamate
that
for
you.
i'll
say
they're
exactly
the
same
thing.
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
rule
was
violated,
what
sixth
amendment
rule
--
rule.
you
know,
you
heard
what
i
said,
the
rule,
don't
talk
to
a
guy
who
wants
a
lawyer
until
you
talk
to
the
lawyer.
no
communications
with
a
client.
it's
a
communication
with
the
lawyer.
that's
one
rule.
and
the
other
rule
is
he's
asked
for
a
lawyer,
but
you
never
gave
him
one.
now,
which
is
this
case?
i
mean,
i
first
thought,
well,
if
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
at
all,
then
it
must
be
the
second,
but
then
i
thought
they
must
have
a
reasonable
time
to
give
him
a
lawyer,
and
they
haven't
violated
that
second.
if
you
have
any
view
on
that,
it
would
be
helpful
to
me.
