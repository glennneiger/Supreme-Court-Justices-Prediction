justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
in
a
situation
like
we
have
here
where
the
law
enforcement
officers
do
not
instruct
the
informant
to
do
anything
that
would
violate
the
sixth
amendment
and
in
fact,
according
to
their
testimony,
instruct
him
to
engage
in
conduct
that's
consistent
with
the
sixth
amendment,
there's
no
deterrent
value
in
later
suppressing
the
use
of
the
statements
for
impeachment
purposes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
want
to
deter?
you
want
--
you
want
to
deter
them
from
using
informants
at
all,
even
in
--
even
in
a
manner
that's
consistent
with
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
which
of
the
things
that
you've
just
said
that
result
from
the
use
of
this
for
impeachment
would
not
be
true
with
respect
to
the
other
situations
where
illegally
obtained
evidence
has
been
used
for
impeachment
purposes?
take
the
fourth
amendment,
for
example.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
dispute
that
there
was
a
sixth
amendment
violation
at
the
time
when
the
statement
was
taken,
do
you?
