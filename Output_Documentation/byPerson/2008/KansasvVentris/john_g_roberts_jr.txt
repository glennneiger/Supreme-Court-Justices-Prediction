we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-1356,
kansas
v.
ventris.
general
mcallister.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
saharsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
say
there's
no
deterrent
value,
since
the
police
are
--
are
not
going
to
do
this,
that
they
know
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
use
this
in
their
case-in-chief.
but
there's
also
no
down
side,
is
there?
i
mean,
you
say
it's
only
for
impeachment
purposes,
but,
you
know,
why
not?
he
may
take
the
stand.
he
may
lie.
better
to
have
this
in
the
bank
instead
of
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
edge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
do
--
do
i
understand
the
first
sentence
on
page
6
of
your
brief
to
concede
that
there's
no
deterrent
value
from
prohibiting
the
introduction
of
these
statements
for
impeachment?
the
sentence
says:
"a
sixth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
that
allowed
use
of
uncounseled
statements
for
impeachment
would
not
deter
violations
of
the
right
to
counsel.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
--
you
agree
with
the
representations
on
--
from
your
friends
on
the
other
side
that
there's
no
case
of
ours
where
we've
excluded
a
statement
or
evidence
submitted
for
impeachment,
even
though
it
would
have
been
excluded
in
this
case-in-chief.
if
you
prevail
here,
it
would
be
the
first
time
that
any
evidence
or
statement
has
been
excluded
when
submitted
for
purposes
of
impeachment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you've
--
you've
emphasized
that
what
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
other
ones
where
we've
allowed
evidence
that
would
be
excluded
from
the
case-in-chief
and
for
impeachment
purposes
is
that
this
is
a
trial
right.
but
the
sixth
amendment
says
in
criminal
prosecutions
you
have
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
well,
he
had
assistance
of
counsel
here,
and
--
and
one
of
the
things
that
counsel
did
was
point
out
the
problems
with
relying
on
the
snitch's
evidence
and
all
the
bad
things
that
he
did.
but
--
but
just
like
in
the
case
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
where
we
allow
the
evidence
to
be
admitted
at
trial,
this
sixth
amendment
problem,
you
know
--
it
doesn't
--
i
just
don't
see
the
--
the
strength
of
that
distinction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
you're
getting
away
from
the
basis
for
your
distinction
then,
saying,
well,
it's
not
just
at
trial.
well,
these
other
constitutional
rights
where
we've
allowed
the
evidence
to
come
in
for
impeachment
are
indistinguishable
from
the
sixth
amendment
right
outside
of
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
pause
on
that,
it
affects
his
decision
to
testify
because
it
makes
it
more
likely
that
he'll
testify
truthfully
if
he
is
going
to
testify.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
focus
--
the
focus
on
the
trial
context
is
at
least
a
double-edged
sword
since
the
harm
that
we're
facilitating
under
your
rule
is
to
allow
--
allow
perjured
testimony.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
and
if
he
has
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
trial,
consistent
with
the
sixth
amendment,
those
--
those
problems
could
be
pointed
out.
he
wasn't
--
he
was
--
he's
not
lying
now.
the
reason
he
said
something
different
then
was,
you
know,
he
likes
to
brag
in
prison
or
whatever
the
basis
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
i
think
it
would.
that's
--
i
think
that's
quite
right.
but
i
don't
see
how
excluding
the
evidence,
even
on
impeachment,
helps
that.
i
mean,
they've
still
got
the
statement,
and
they
--
you
know,
i
guess
your
point
is,
you
know,
maybe
they'll
get
some
leads
from
it
even
if
they
can't
use
it.
but
excluding
the
evidence
for
impeachment
purposes
doesn't
eliminate
that
harm.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
mcallister,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
today
in
case
07-1356,
kansas
versus
ventris.
