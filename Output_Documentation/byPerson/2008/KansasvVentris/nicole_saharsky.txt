ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
consistently
allowed
the
use
of
voluntary
statements
obtained
in
violation
of
constitutional
standards
for
impeachment
purposes,
and
that
same
rule
should
apply
here.
there's
no
question
that
respondent's
statements
were
voluntary,
and
the
substantial
societal
costs
of
allowing
him
to
commit
perjury
unchecked
greatly
outweigh
any
speculative
deterrence
benefits
that
would
flow
from
a
per
se
rule
of
exclusion.
the
purpose
of
the
right
to
counsel
is
to
provide
an
adversary
process
to
ensure
the
defendant
gets
a
fair
trial.
and
to
effectuate
that
right,
the
court
has
excluded
deliberately
elicited
statements
from
the
government's
case-in-chief.
but
not
allowing
the
statements
for
impeachment
purposes
doesn't
further
that
right.
instead,
what
it
does
is
allow
the
defendant
to
distort
the
truth-seeking
process,
and
that's
just
too
high
a
price
to
pay.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
but
there
is
a
down
side.
i
mean,
as
this
court
recognized
in
cases
versus
--
like
hudson
v.
michigan,
for
example,
the
police
have
their
own
codes
of
conduct.
they
have
training
on
constitutional
rules
and
standards.
and
if
they
violate
those
constitutional
rules
and
standards,
it
has
real
effect
for
the
police.
it
has
effect
in
terms
of
internal
discipline,
in
--
in
terms
of
limiting
their
career
opportunities.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
evidence
in
the
briefs,
and
i
am
not
aware
of
specific
instances
of
discipline,
but
i
think
that
that's
because
this
situation
arises
pretty
infrequently.
you
know,
when
this
came
up
in
the
kansas
supreme
court,
it
was
a
case
of
first
impression.
and
as
general
mcallister
noted,
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
why
the
police
would
want
to
just
follow
the
rule
in
kuhlman
and
send
the
informant
in
to
be
a
passive
listening
post
because
if--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
the
department
of
justice
manual
sets
out
this
court's
rules
in
terms
of
the
kuhlman
case
and
the
henry
case.
and
then,
of
course,
there
are
also
state
and
the
model
professional
ethics
rules
that
talk
about
when
a
prosecutor
can
contact
a
person
who
is
represented
by
counsel.
and
there
are
limitations
there
as
well,
both
in
terms
of
the
prosecutor
contacting
a
person
represented
or
using
an
agent
contacting
a
person
represented.
but
i
mean,
those
are
--
those
are
deterrents.
i
think
the
police
discipline
is
a
deterrent.
but
i
think
we
also
need
to
--
to
focus
on
this
court's
cases
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
jackson
context
that
taking
the
evidence
and
making
it
unavailable
in
the
government's
case-in-chief
is
a
substantial
deterrent.
this
court
said
in
each
of
those
previous
case
that
not
having
the
evidence
available
in
the
government's
case-in-chief
is
a
very
high
price
to
pay,
because
that
means
that
the
government
has
to
come
up
with
other
evidence
that
can
meet
its
burden
of
proving
all
of
the
elements
of
the
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and,
as
general
mcallister
noted,
it's
really
very
speculative,
and
the
police
certainly
wouldn't
know
at
the
time
they're
asking
questions
of
the
defendant,
whether
this
rebuttal
impeachment
evidence
could
ever
be
used.
it's
entirely
within
the
control
of
the
defendant.
it's
only
if
the
defendant
--
if
the
government
first
meets
its
burden
of
proof
with
other
evidence
at
trial,
and
then
the
defendant
decides
to
testify,
and
then
he
testifies
inconsistently
with
his
prior
statements.
and
our
position
is
at
that
point
that
the
jury
should
hear
the
conflicting
evidence
just
as
it
has
heard
it
in
all
of
these
other
previous
cases
and
be
allowed
to
make
a
decision
about
who's
telling
the
truth.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
again,
i
--
i
think
that
there
is
a
down
side
in
terms
of
police
discipline
and
the
deterrence--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
--
i--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--again,
i
think
that
most
police
officers
just
follow
the
rule
that
this
court
set
forth
in
kuhlmann,
so
that
this
--
this
issue
has
not
arisen
frequently.
but,
you
know,
even
if
you
thought
that
there
would
be
some
type
of
minimal
deterrence
benefit
that
would
arise
from
--
from
not
making
the
evidence
available
for
impeachment
purposes,
you
have
to
balance
it
against
the
cost
to
the
truth-seeking
process
that
would
be
incurred
if
the
defendant--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
if
they're--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that
--
that
is
what
i
was
going
to
say.
i
mean,
as
general
mcallister
noted,
that
--
that
happened
in
this
case.
the
prosecutor
himself
got
up
and
talked
about
the
--
the
informant's
prior
offenses,
why
the
informant
was
in
jail,
whether
the
informant
received
anything
in
exchange
for
his
testimony,
the
fact
that
the
informant
had
actually
gone
back
to
jail
after
testifying
--
or
after
serving
as
an
informant
in
this
case.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
that
the
--
the
fact
that
the
evidence
would
be
unavailable
in
the
government's
case-in-chief
really
is
a
strong
price
that
the
government
pays.
and
--
and
this
court
recognized
it
in
--
in
havens,
in
walder,
in
harris,
in
hass,
in
harvey,
and
--
and
all
of
those
prior
cases.
and
there's
just
--
there's
not
any
reason
to
depart
from
them
because
the
--
the
other
side
of
the
balance
is
that,
you
know,
you're
letting
a
defendant
to
get
up
and
take
the
stand
and
--
and
not
subject
himself
to
this
prior
statement.
and
this
--
this
prior
statement,
if
believed
by
the
jury,
is
incredibly
important
to
his
credibility,
probative
with
respect
to
whether
the
crimes
were
committed
and
the
defendant
is
telling
the
truth.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
every
case
has
a
question
about
someone's
credibility,
some
witness's
credibility,
and
that's
for
the
jury
to
decide.
and
in
--
in
this
case
there
was
ample
cross-examination.
there
was
the
limiting
instruction
that
the
state
mentioned.
i
mean,
clearly
the
jury
did
its
job
here
because
it
went
back
and
it
considered
all
this
information.
and
it
didn't
come
back
with
a
--
a
verdict
--
although
you,
of
course,
never
know
exactly
what
the
jury
is
thinking,
it
didn't
come
back
with
a
verdict
suggesting
it
just
reflexively
believed
the
informant's
testimony.
so--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--certainly
not.
in
the
fifth
amendment
context,
the
text
of
the
amendment
itself
would
prohibit
the
use
of
that
statement
for
any
purposes.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
because
the
text
of
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
exclusion
of
evidence
at
trial.
what
it
does
is
it
guarantees
counsel
for
a
purpose,
and
that
purpose
is
to
ensure
an
adversary
process
at
trial.
and
if
counsel
is
not
afforded,
then
it's
up
to
the
courts
to
determine
what
the
remedy
is.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i'm
sorry.
i
missed
the
first
part.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that's
not
true.
i
mean,
certainly
counsel
is
available
at
trial.
the
question
is
just
whether
statements
that
were
obtained
without
counsel
prior
to
trial
can
be
used
for
impeachment
purposes.
the
answer--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i'm
sorry
if
i
suggested
that.
no,
the
sixth
amendment
violation
occurs
when
the
statements
are
introduced
in
the
government's
case-in-chief
at
trial.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
and
that's
because
the
government
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
behind
counsel
prior
to
trial
and
gather
up
statements,
and
then
use
them
to
prove
guilt
at
trial.
that
subverts
the
adversary
process.
when
you're
talking
about
impeachment,
you're
not
talking
about
proving
guilt
at
trial.
you're
not
talking
about
the
government
distorting
the
adversary
process.
if
there's
any
distortion
of
the
adversary
process,
it's
with
the
defendant
attempting
to
commit
perjury
at
that
point.
the
sixth
amendment
is
just
different
from
the
fifth
amendment
in
that
it
does
not
say
anything
about
statements
that
are
obtained
and
if
they
can
be
used
at
trial.
and
that
means
that
it's
up
to
courts
to
balance
the
costs
and
benefits
of
exclusion
of
evidence.
and
in
the
case
of
the
government's
case-in-chief,
that
balance
means
that
that
the
statements
cannot
come
in
because
it
would
be
too
much
of
a
cost
to
the
adversary
process
that
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
to
allow
the
statements
in.
but,
when
you
switch
over
to
looking
at
impeachment,
this
court
said
50
years
ago
impeachment
is
a
very
different
story
than
the
government's
case-in-chief.
the
interest
that
you're
talking
about
furthering
there,
the
adversary
process
interest,
would
not
be
furthered
by
allowing
the
defendant
to
take
the
stand
and
be
able
to
commit
perjury
unchecked.
it
would
not
be
furthered,
and
it
would
--
it
would
not
lead
to
greater
deterrence
by
simply
allowing
the
statements
to
be
unavailable
for
impeachment
purposes
because
the
great
deterrent
comes
with
the
statements
being
unavailable
in
the
government's
case-in-chief.
we
just
don't
think
that
there's
any
reason
to
depart
from
this
court's
rule
that
so
long
as
statements
are
not
involuntary,
they
can
be
used
for
impeachment
purposes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
submit
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
