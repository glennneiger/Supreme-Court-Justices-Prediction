roberts,

we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-453,
cuomo
v.
the
clearing
house
association.
ms.
underwood.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
correct
with
respect
to
a
particular
loan.
it's
not
respect
--
with
respect
to
federal
policy
about
national
banks
around
the
country.
it's
conceivable
and
i
suppose
likely
that
the
federal
regulator
would
want
the
same
rule
to
apply
to
banks
in
michigan
as
to
banks
in
hawaii.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
an
historic
reason
for
thinking
that
congress
would
be
more
concerned
about
states
exercising
visitorial
powers
than
they
would
be
about
private
attorneys
general
or
private
lawyers.
this
goes
back
to
mcculloch
v.
maryland.
national
banks
were
always
targeted
by
the
states.
they
weren't
typically
targeted
by
private
attorneys.
so
that
incongruity
doesn't
strike
me
as
terribly
significant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
want
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
chevron?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
whatever
the
arguments
may
be
on
the
merits,
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
visitorial
powers
has
an
unambiguous
meaning
that
would
pre-empt
the
authority
of
the
occ
to
explain
it
to
us.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
--
i'm
sorry,
but
it
certainly
is
pre-empted
with
respect
to
visitorial
powers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
kind
of
gets
us
back
to
where
we
started.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
your
concern
that
--
not
with
the
substantive
state
law,
but
that
leaving
enforcement
to
the
states
would
cause
particular
problems?
i
mean
there
may
be
a
state
law
provision
that
says
you
shall
do
this,
and
the
way
the
attorney
general
elects
to
enforce
it
is
by
shutting
the
bank
down,
jailing
the
bank
officers,
doing
all
sorts
of
things
that
--
that
the
--
the
federal
government
may
not
consider
appropriate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
five
minutes,
ms.
underwood.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
why
isn't
it
a
complete
answer
to
what
i
agree
is
a
somewhat
unusual
situation
of
pre-empting
enforcement
but
not
the
substance
of
law
that
its
enforcement
that
raises
the
concerns?
that
the
federal
government
thinks
the
state
law
is
fine,
but
when
you
get
attorneys
general
enforcing
it
in
a
particular
way,
that's
what
causes
the
problem.
and
i
mean,
the
problem
arises
in
a
lot
of
areas.
even
within
the
federal
government,
the
fbi
and
dea
have
different
ways
of
enforcing
that
might
conflict
with
each
other.
why
doesn't
that
make
perfect
sense?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
why
--
why
is
it
a
mistake?
why
can't
congress
or
the
occ
think
that
that's
where
the
difficulties
are
going
to
arise?
in
other
words,
it's
kind
of
a
less
intrusive
approach,
and
saying,
well,
you
can
have
your
state
law
but
we
are
concerned
about
enforcement,
so
we
are
going
to
be
the
ones
that
enforce
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
answer
is
because
they
have
different
entities
that
can
enforce
it,
they
are
sort
of
in
for
a
penny,
in
for
a
pound?
if
you
let
anybody
else
enforce
it,
you
have
got
to
let
everybody
else
enforce
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
including
the
entities
that
have
historically
have
targeted
national
banks?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
suppose
the
question
would
not
be
what
we
think
is
a
good
idea
but
what
congress
has
done.
and
here
the
occ
has
interpreted
what
congress
has
done
is
to
make
exclusive
the
occ
regulation
only
with
respect
to
enforcement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
suppose
you
would
thank
them
for
that
rather
than
criticize
them
for
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
underwood.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
08-453,
cuomo
versus
the
clearing
house
association.
