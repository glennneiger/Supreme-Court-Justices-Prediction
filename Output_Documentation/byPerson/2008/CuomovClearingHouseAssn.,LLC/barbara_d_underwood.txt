ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
occ
regulation
at
issue
here,
state
antidiscrimination
and
consumer
protection
laws
can
be
enforced
against
national
banks
by
the
federal
occ
and
by
private
parties,
but
not
by
state
attorneys
general.
this
unusual
enforcement
pre-emption,
which
detaches
the
state's
power
to
make
laws
from
its
power
to
enforce
them,
was
not
written
into
the
national
bank
act
by
congress
in
1864,
and
it's
implausible
that
congress
implicitly
delegated
to
occ
the
power
to
read
it
in
now.
we
know
the
nba
did
not
in
1864
enact
enforcement
pre-emption
against
the
states
for
three
reasons:
first,
the
words
of
the
statute;
second,
a
long
line
of
cases
from
this
court,
especially
st.
louis,
upholding
the
power
of
the
state
to
enforce
laws
against
a
national
bank
or
rejecting
it
on
the
ground
that
the
law
was
substantively
pre-empted,
but
not
questioning
the
power
of
the
state
to
enforce
a
valid
law;
and,
finally,
the
wholly
anomalous
character,
foreign
really
to
our
structure
of
government,
of
separating
the
power
to
make
law
from
the
power
to
enforce
it.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
first
of
all,
the
bank
superintendent
in
new
york
doesn't
have
authority
over
national
banks.
it
has
authority
only
over
state
banks,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief.
so
we
don't
assert
that
authority.
i
would
say
that
the
--
and
the
injunction
doesn't
run
--
that's
at
issue
in
this
case,
doesn't
run
against
the
superintendent.
it
runs
against
the
attorney
general.
but
i
would
say--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
believe
that
the
banking
superintendent
does
not
assert
authority
to
enforce
in
a
regulatory
fashion
against
national
banks.
if
they
did,
if
--
if
--
if
the
bank
superintendent
asserted
a
chartering
or
licensing
supervisory
regime,
that
would
be
a
different
issue
from
the
question--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
the
--
the
bank
--
the
banking
superintendent
of
new
york
does
not
enforce
against
national
banks.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
that
is
right.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
read
differently
or
interpreted
or
applied
differently.
what's
at
issue
here
is
a
distinction
between
a
supervisory
regime
--
"visitation"
is
a
regime
characterized
by
routine
examinations,
no
cause
needed,
by
a
chartering
or
a
licensing
authority
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
limitations
on--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
an
--
there
is
a
single
standard
of
discrimination.
it
is
the
case
that
the
--
that
the
federal
standards
applied
by
the
occ
and
the
state
law
all
look
to
title
vii
law
about
a
prima
facie
case
being--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there
has
been
no
such
multiplicity
of
--
of
enforcement.
in
fact,
there
is
so
much
antidiscrimination
work
to
go
around
that
having
multiple
enforcers
is
a
device
for--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it
is
already
the
case
that
under
the
fair
housing
act,
hud
is
required
to
refer--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there
is
no
record
of
any
such
problem.
and
should
such
a
--
yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
should
such
a
problem
arise,
that
would
be
an
occasion
for
considering
a
kind
of
burden
pre-emption
that
would
be
similar
--
on
evidence
of
such
a
problem,
that
might
be
a
basis
for
occ
to
make
a
record
and
enact
a
regulation
to
deal
with
that--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
its
regulation
doesn't
say
that.
the
injunction
that
was
issued
in
this
case
doesn't
say
that.
what
the
regulation,
the
rulemaking,
and
the
injunction
all
rest
on
is
a
legal
analysis,
not
an
empirical
one.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
and
the
occ--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it
is.
but
if
the
question
was
would
the
--
would
the
actual
act
of
responding
to
a
complaint
or
to
discovery
burden
particular
people
because
there
would
be
50
people
asking
for
the
same
information,
that's
not
the
case,
because
the
loans
made
in
new
york
would
be
analyzed
by
a
new
york
enforcer.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
federal
government--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that
appears
to
be
the
case.
in
fact,
they
have
acknowledged
that
the
state
law
actually
applies.
it's
undisputed.
occ
said
so
in
its
complaint.
congress
has
several
times
said
so,
which
is
presumably
why
the
occ
says
so
--
said
so
in
the
fair
housing
act
savings
clause,
in
the
--
in
the
equal
credit
opportunity
act
savings
clause,
and
in
riegle-neal,
which
specifically
applies
only
to
national
bank
branches,
but
expressly
preserves
the
application
of
state
fair
lending
and
consumer
protection
laws.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
there
are
many
things
that
they
might
do.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
for
example,
make
some
provision
for
--
in
fact,
i
believe
there
are
some
regulations
that
call
for
conferencing
and
collaboration
and
consultation
among
the
state
enforcers
and
between
the
state
and
federal
regulators
to
avoid
duplicative
regulation.
there
is
already
the
potential
with
respect
to
state
banks
that
are
supervised
both
by
state
regulators
and
by
the
fdic.
there
are
alternate
audits
in
alternate
years.
i
mean,
there
--
there
is
plenty
of
precedent
in
bank
regulation
for
mechanisms
for
consultation
and
collaboration
so
that
people
don't
step
on
each
other's
toes.
and
in
federal
criminal
enforcement,
for
example,
there
are
--
there
are
many
--
many
occasions
where
there
is
both
federal
and
state
authority
to
enforce.
and
the
result
of
that
tends
to
be
to
get
more
extensive,
fuller
enforcement.
people
don't
tend
to
both
bring
the
same
case.
if
somebody
is
enforcing
something,
somebody
--
a
different
enforcer
will
attack
a
different
problem.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there
are
two
reasons
for
that
provision.
the
purpose
of
that
provision
was
to
confirm
that
occ
didn't
lose
its
pre-existing
enforcement
power
when
riegle-neal
stated
--
that's
(1)(b)
--
in
(1)(a)
that
national
branches
would
be
treated
more
or
less
like
state
branches
for
purposes
of
consumer
protection
and
fair
lending.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
there
is
another
reason
in
the
legislative
history,
which
makes
it
clear
that
it
was
a
directive
to
occ
to
mount
an
enforcement
program
which
congress
thought
it
had
not
been
doing.
we
know
that
because
in
the
conference
report
and
other
legislative
history
congress
says
it's
trying
to
expand,
not
contract,
the
enforcement
of
fair
lending
and
consumer
protection
laws,
and
that
the
law
isn't
taking
any
authority
away
from
the
states
and
that
they
are
distressed
at
the
inadequate
failure
of
occ
to
exercise
its
enforcement
authority.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
absolutely.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
it
isn't
talking
--
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
exclusive
authority,
and
it
isn't
talking
about
judicial
enforcement,
which
occ
doesn't
do.
it
is
talking
about
it's
--
it
has
a
savings
clause
kind
of
function
and
it
--
it's
hortatory,
it's
directing
occ
to
exercise
the
authority
that
it
has.
it
seems
to
be
common
ground
that
it
didn't
give
occ
any
new
power,
because
it
would
be
odd
to
give
occ
different
power
over
the
branches
--
this
only
applies
to
the
branches
--
different
power
to
the
branches
than
over
the
branches
than
over
the
banks,
different,
more
extensive
power
over
consumer
protection
and
fair
lending
than
other
kinds
of
bank
enforcement.
this
was
a
provision
dealing
with
branches
and
consumer
protection
and
fair
lending
that
said
to
occ:
you
still
have
that
authority
and
you
should
exercise
it.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
because
you
can
look
at
books
and
records
under
various
authorities.
books
and
--
you
can
look
at
books
and
records
under
your
visitorial
authority,
if
you
are
the
supervisor
and
have
the
relationship
to
the
bank
that
a
licensing
or
chartering
authority
has
and
you
are
looking
at
them
for
no
particular
cause.
or
you
can
look
at
books
and
records
if
you
have
a
civil
suit
against
the
bank
and
you
are
engaging
in
discovery
that
is
--
or
for
that
matter
a
criminal
prosecution
against
the
bank,
and
ancillary
to
that
discovery
is
required;
or
in
guthrie,
the
inquiry
--
the
looking
at
books
and
records
was
pursuant
to
a
statutory
authority
for
shareholders
to
look
at
books
and
records.
so
the
simple
fact
of
a
physical
act
of
looking
--
or
a
legal
act
of
looking
at
books
and
records
doesn't
tell
you
whether
visitorial
authority
is
being
exercised.
visitorial
authority
has
long
been
understood
as
a
whole
regime
of
oversight.
watters
involved
a
visitorial
regime
that
was
ancillary
to
licensing.
the
earlier
visitorial
regimes
that
were
referenced
in
the
old
treatise
tended
to
involve
visitorial
regimes
that
were
established
ancillary
to
chartering,
back
when
corporate
charters
had
limited
purposes,
the
way
banks
do
still,
but
most
corporate
charters,
most
corporate
certificates
of
incorporation
don't
anymore.
so
the
fact
that
books
and
records
are
being
examined
is
neither
here
nor
there
on
the
question
whether
the
visitorial
power
that
is
referenced
in
484
is
--
is
being
exercised.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
the
suggestion
is
made
that
484,
and
there
is
some
historical
basis
for
it,
was
--
was
meant
to
protect
national
banks
against
--
against,
hostile
states,
which
i
guess
is
what
you
are
suggesting,
rather
than
hostile
private
people.
but
actually
what
it
was
meant
to
do
was
assign
responsibility
for
the
supervision
of
these
new
entities
--
there
hadn't
been
banks
like
this,
private
banks
which
were
nevertheless
federally
chartered.
before
that
there
was
the
national
bank
that
was
at
issue
in
mcculloch
v
maryland,
and
to
exclude
the
states
from
asserting
the
authority
to
do
audits,
to
do
regular
banking
examinations,
which
actually
one
senator
had
proposed
the
states
be
permitted
to
do
and
that
was
rejected.
i
would
say
the
concern
about
state
hostility
was
apparently
much
reduced
by
1869,
not
much
after
this
statute
was
passed,
when
this
court
in
national
bank
v.
kentucky
upheld
the
power
of
the
states
not
just
to
tax
shareholders
on
their
shares,
but
to
require
the
national
banks
to
help,
to
require
the
national
banks
to
pay
the
tax
that
was
due
from
those
shareholders
in
order
to
assist
in
collection.
and
the
court
--
mcculloch
was
cited
to
the
court
and
the
court
said
it
saw
no
possibility
here,
unlike
in
mcculloch,
that
the
state
would
somehow
use
its
authority
in
this
way
to
incapacitate
the
banks
or
impair
them
by
eliciting
their
help
to
collect
a
valid
tax.
there
actually
had
been
some
thought
when
the
national
banks
were
first
created
that
they
would,
in
the
marketplace,
drive
state
banks
out
of
existence,
but
they
didn't.
and
the
story
has
been
one
legislatively
of
maintaining
competitive
equality
between
them,
not
of
hostility.
so--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i'd
say
two
thing
about
that.
484
may
have
some
ambiguity
about
it.
i
think
it
is
not
ambiguous
as
to
the
matters
covered
by
this
regulation.
visitorials
have
--
visitorial
powers
have
never
been
understood
to
include
discrete
acts
of
law
enforcement
by
a
jurisdiction
that
neither
has
nor
asserts
supervisory
relationship,
the
kind
of
supervisory
relationship
that
the
chartering
or
licensing
sovereign
has.
so
i
think--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
the
strongest
quotations
that
his
brief
mentioned
several
times
come
from
blackstone.
he
talks
about
inquiring
into
all
misbehaviors
of
the
supervised
visited
corporation.
those
comments
are
made
in
a
time
and
place
when
there
was
only
one
sovereign,
not
the
distinctive
federalism
we
have
today,
and
so
there
was
no
need
to
distinguish
between
the
visitorial,
the
distinctly
visitorial
powers
of
the
sovereign,
and
the
coexisting
police
powers
of
another
sovereign.
there
was
no--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
think
that
the
point
about
blackstone's
comment
to
distinguish
--
the
point
about
the
distinction
between
the
charitable
corporations
and
the
public
non-charitable
corporations
is
that
it
may
well
be
that
the
sovereign
was
enforcing
not
just
the
charter,
but
the
laws
of
the
sovereign
with
respect
to
that
state.
it
simply--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes,
but
the
sovereign
might
do
it
in
many
different
--
a
supervisor
might
do
it
in
many
different
ways,
just
as
occ
here
claims
to
enforce
law
not
by
going
into
court--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
general
laws
of
the
visitor,
of
the
sovereign.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that
is
correct.
that
is--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--they're
pre-empting
--
that's
correct.
they
are
preempting
our
ability
to
enforce
any
laws.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
this
court
in,
for
example,
st.
louis
said
that
when
the
federal
and
the
state
prohibition
were
the
same,
that
is,
a
bank
couldn't
branch
at
that
time
or
couldn't
interstate
branch,
the
--
and
the
--
and
state
tried
to
enforce
both
provisions
--
they
were
the
same,
but
the
state
tried
to
enforce
both
the
federal
charter
limitation
and
the
state
law,
this
court
said
the
state
could
not
enforce
the
federal
charter,
because
that
was
the
prerogative
of
the
chartering
visitor,
but
that
it
could
enforce
the
state
prohibition.
and
it
said
that
separating
--
if
the
law
is
valid
and
can
be
validly
applied,
then
it's
virtually
unthinkable
to
separate
the
authority
to
enforce
it
from
the
application
of
the
law.
this
court
said
that
in
--
in
st.
louis;
it
--
actually
it
said
it
in
--
in
easton,
which
went
the
other
way.
that
is
to
say,
easton
was
a
criminal
prosecution
of
a
bank
officer
for
taking
deposits
knowing
the
bank
was
insolvent.
prosecution
under
state
law.
and
this
court
said
that
the
law
itself
had
to
be
preempted.
wasn't
clear
exactly
what
federal
law
on
the
subject
was.
the
court
said
there
must
be
some
federal
law
in
this
area,
but
we
can't
afford
to
have
conflicting
laws,
so
it's
substantively
pre-empted.
but
the
court
also
said,
if
it
were
valid,
it
would
be
unthinkable
to
bar
the
state
from
enforcing
it.
and
that
is
the
correct
way,
we
think,
to
approach
this
problem.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
no,
because
congress
has
said
to
the
contrary.
congress
has
said,
that's
why
they
didn't
--
presumably
why
they
didn't
do
it
that
way.
congress
has
said
state
law
shall
apply.
so
i
think
this
is
an
area
where
congress
clearly
had
in
mind
that
there
would
be,
not
broad
pre-emption
of
this
kind,
but
the
laws
would
apply.
but
that
it--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
that
is
correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it
does.
but
think
that
--
i
would
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
thank
you.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
a
couple
of
--
four
points
or
so.
to
the
extent
the
subpoena
is
perceived
--
or
this
discovery
request
--
it
didn't
even
proceed
to
this
subpoena
stage
--
is
perceived
to
be
burdensome,
state
laws
allows
a
motion
to
quash
a
subpoena
for
inadequate
basis
or
for
harassment.
so
there
is
control
in
the
state
courts
over
anything
that
is
perceived
to
be
excessive.
two,
states
have
been
enforcing
consumer
protection
and
fair
lending
laws
since
the
mid
'70s
when
they
were
enacted.
the
center
for
responsive
lending
amicus
brief
has
a
discussion
of
that
history
of
enforcement.
the
conway
affidavit
at
the
joint
appendix
at
152
has
a
description
of
new
york's
enforcement
activities
between
1975
and
2004.
and
the
lawyers'
committee
for
civil
rights
also
goes
over
that
history.
and
they
have
been
enforcing
other
laws
against
national
banks
for
even
longer,
antitrust
laws,
branching
laws,
idiosyncratic
laws
of
various
sorts
with
no
evidence
that
this
has
impaired
the
functions
of
the
banks.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
in
the
exceptions?
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
virtually
every
exception
was
enacted
to
resolve
a
controversy
over
whether
something
was
visitorial
or
not.
in
fact,
just
as
in
guthrie,
where
this
court
said
the
shareholders'
suit
for
bank
records
was
not
visitorial,
or
alternatively,
if
it
is,
it
is
covered
by
the
courts
of
justice
exception.
so
too,
each
of
those
exceptions
involved
a
situation
where
there
was
a
claim,
an
incorrect
claim,
but
a
claim
that
the
action
would
be
banned
as
visitorial,
so
congress--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
even
without
enforcement
of
state
law,
occ
would
not
have
exclusive
control
of
enforcement
of
discrimination
laws
against
national
banks.
so
the
idea
that
state
enforcement
poses
some
special
problem
to
interfere
with
that
exclusive
control
is
just
a
mistake.
that's
not
the
way
congress
set
it
up.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
didn't
mean
it's
a
mistake
of
policy.
i
meant
it's
a
mistake
in
description
of
the
regime
congress
created.
hud
has
administrative
enforcement.
doj
has
litigation
enforcement.
this
is
a
federal
law.
private
parties
can
enforce
federal
fair
housing
law.
states
can
probably
enforce
federal
fair
housing
laws,
too,
as
--
patriotic
for
the
victim.
the
second
circuit
set
aside
that
part
of
the
injunction,
the
part
that
barred
new
york
from
enforcing
federal
law.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
i
don't
say
that--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
don't
make
that
argument.
what
i
say
is
that
is
strong
evidence
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
give
occ
exclusive
control
here.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
think
that
in
many
ways
leaving
the
law
intact
and
denying
the
states
the
ability
to
enforce
it
is
more
intrusive
then
simply
finding
pre-emption.
in
any
event,
congress
made
it
quite
clear
that
it
didn't
want
pre-emption.
i
think
my
time
is
up.
