justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
it
supposed
to
work?
this
is
what
is
bothering
me
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
i
imagine
that
banks,
particularly
right
in
these
last
few
months,
are
in
situations
where
there
are
three
categories
of
--
of
borrowers.
one
might
be
a
category
of
people
whom
you
are
reasonably
confident
in,
and
the
second
is
a
category
of
people
who
are
borderline
or
less
so,
and
there
are
also
minorities.
now,
where
you
make
the
decision
as
a
bank
to
deny
them
the
loan,
it
sometimes
is
difficult
to
say
whether
that
decision
was
made
for
a
discriminatory
reason,
namely
race,
or
for
a
legitimate
reason,
namely
because
this
was
a
person
unlikely
to
pay
the
money
back.
now,
how
is
a
bank
to
function
if
50
different
attorneys
general
plus
the
federal
agencies
all
look
at
the
books
of
the
bank
to
look
at
the
individual
loan
and
to
make
that
kind
of
determination
about
which
quite
honestly
reasonable
people
will
often
differ?
and
how
--
how
is
that
really
a
problem,
or
am
i
just
creating
that?
and
if
it's
really
a
problem,
how
in
your
opinion
does
the
federal
law
deal
with
that
problem,
if
not
in
the
way
that
your
opponent
suggests?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
may
say
so,
that
response
overlooks
the
question.
i
don't
doubt
the
single
standard.
what
i
do
doubt
is
in
the
--
in
the
category
of
uncertain
cases,
that
51
different
individuals,
50
state
attorneys
general
plus
one
federal
individual,
will
reach
the
same
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
these
are
hard
and,
therefore,
they
will
reach
a
lot
of
different
results
under
the
same
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
you
deny
the
hypothetical.
you
are
saying
that
my
analysis
of
the
problem
is
wrong;
there
simply
is
no
such
problem,
and
since
there
is
no
such
problem,
it
doesn't
matter
if
everyone
enforces
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
your
answer
yes
or
no
to
what
i
just
said,
that
you
deny
that
the
statement
of
the
problem
is
realistic
and
therefore
there
is
no
problem
in
your
view
about
having
51
different
people
enforce
the
same
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
should
such
a
problem
arise,
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
are
just
at
the
point
of
getting
to
what
i
--
the
blank
in
my
mind.
and
the
blank
in
my
mind
is
when
you
said,
but
if
there
were
such
a
problem,
as
i
had
described,
but
if
there
were,
then
they
could
--
and
now
that's
the
blank.
then
they
could
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
example,
just
give
me
two,
a
couple.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
--
could
they
--
could
the
federal
authorities
pre-empt
the
state
law,
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
--
can
i
take
what
justice
ginsburg
just
said,
and
give
you
a
thought
that
i
am
interested
in
your
response
to?
i
haven't
seen
the
letter
from
the
attorney
general.
is
the
whole
thing
in
the
record?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
reading
judge
parker's
description
of
it,
it
seemed
to
me
that
what
he
had
said
was
that
there
are
statistical
disparities
between
interest
rates
and
race.
well,
as
long
as,
most
unfortunately,
income
is
correlated
with
race,
with
minorities
being
towards
the
bottom,
of
course
such
statistical
disparities
will
exist,
some
legitimate,
some
not.
so
if
the
only
basis
for
getting
this
information
is
that
allegation,
it's
hard
to
see
how
this
differs
from
the
case
that
justice
ginsburg
put.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
might
be
quite
a
different
case,
if
they
had
gone
into
court
and
found
individuals
who
were
really
getting
different
interest
rates
and
who
really
seemed
very,
very
similar,
but
for
race.
but
at
that
point,
they'd
have
to
go
get
this
same
information,
because
that's
where
they
would
find
whether
that
prima
facie
case
was
right
or
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
see
what
i'm
doing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
dividing
the
matter
vertically,
instead
of,
say,
horizontally--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
want
to
know
if
that's
possible.
