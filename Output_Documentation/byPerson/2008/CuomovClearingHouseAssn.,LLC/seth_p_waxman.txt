mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
484
plainly
has
pre-emptive
effect,
and
what
it
pre-empts,
quoting
this
court's
decision
in
watters,
is,
quote,
"the
state's
investigative
and
enforcement
machinery.
"
close
quote.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
oh,
i
--
i
quite
agree,
and
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that
this
court's
decision
in
watters,
you
know,
the
holding
in
watters
concludes
the
outcome
of
this
case.
but
this
court,
in
section
ii
a
of
watters
--
and
we
did
have
a
state
statutory
regime
that
dealt,
yes,
with
licensure
but
also
with
examination,
supervision,
and
enforcement,
including
judicial
enforcement
--
this
court
repeatedly
described
that
what
was
pre-empted
is
--
and
this
goes
to,
i
think,
a
point
that
justice
scalia
was
making
--
was
not
substantive
pre-emption.
there
are
substantive
pre-emption
provisions
that
are
addressed
in
other
sections
of
the
act,
including
the
one
that
was
at
issue
in
smiley.
what
is
exempted,
this
court
said
again
and
again,
is
the
state's
enforcement
and
investment
and
--
investigative
and
enforcement
machinery,
or
its
examination
and
enforcement
authority,
and
that
those--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
or
not
what
the
attorney
general
here
sought
to
do
is
the
exercise
of
a
visitorial
power.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there
--
the
letters
are
in
the
record
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'd
like
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'd
like
to
address
both
the
vertical
and
horizontal
axes
of
what
i
perceive
to
be
your
question.
one
is
the
distinction
that
this
court
drew
in
guthrie,
where
it
said
there
is
a
--
there's
a
huge
distinction
in
determining
what's
a
visitorial
power
between
a
private
individual
seeking
to
vindicate
a
deprivation
of
his
or
her
traditional
property
right,
which
is
what
was
at
issue
there,
and
what
the
court
--
what
this
court
said
was
the
public
right
of
visitation,
which
it
also
explained
was
the
state's,
quote,
"enforcing
observance
of
its
laws
and
regulations.
"
there
is
a
public
and
private
distinction,
and
visitation
deals
with
the
former.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
deals
with
the
sovereign.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
breyer,
i'll
get
to
the
horizontal
axis
in
a
moment.
i'm
afraid
i'm
going
to
forget--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--let
me
go
--
let
me
go
to
your
axis
first,
which
is
to
say
that
anything
that
is
a
visitorial
power
can
also
be
interpreted
as
a
police
or
enforcement
power,
and
what
congress
had
in
mind
--
this
is
legislation
that
was
born
in
the
crucible
of
the
civil
war,
and
what
congress
sought
to
pre-empt
was
state
executive
action,
state
examination
and
enforcement
action
with
respect
to
these
newly
created,
very
important
federal
instrumentalities.
that
was
historically
done,
this
court
explained
in
guthrie,
and
chancellor
kent
and
blackstone
and
many
other
authorities
agree
was
historically
done
through
access
to
the
courts;
and
in
fact
what
dean
pound
in
his
oft-cited
article
about
visitorial
powers
said,
was
--
he
said,
and
this
is
discussed
at
pages
16
through
18
of
the
amicus
brief
of
the
financial
services
roundtable
--
what
he
called,
quote,
"the
leading
case
for
visitorial
powers
in
equity.
"
was
a
case
called
the
attorney
general
v
chicago
and
northwest
railroad
decided
in
1874,
in
which
the
attorney
general
of
wisconsin
was
seeking
to
require
this
railroad
to
comply
with
the
state's
mandated
rate
schedule.
that
was
a
visitorial
power,
even
though
you
could
also
call
it
a
law
enforcement
power.
now,
justice
breyer,
on
the
horizontality
of
your
question:
this
is
not
a
suit
in
which
the
new
york
attorney
general
is
trying
to
enforce
its
employment
discrimination
laws
or
its
health
laws
or
its
zoning
laws.
the
attorney
general
wants
the
loan
records
of
national
banks,
and
he
wants
them
so
that
he
can
evaluate
for
himself
whether
the
banks
are
making
proper
judgments
about
how
to
market
and
how
to
price
their
loans.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
they
would.
and
in
fact--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
their
--
the
occ
in
the
preamble
to
its
regulations
does
draw
a
distinction
between
state
enforcement
actions
and
a
pure
state
declaratory
judgment,
quote,
"as
to
the
meaning
of
the
applicable
law.
"
this
is
a
case
that
--
in
which--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
this
is
--
this
case
is
certainly
in
the
core,
but
a
--
a
state
authority,
whether
it's
the
state
banking
commission
or
the
state
human
rights
commission
or
the
state
attorney
general,
or
for
that
matter
another
federal
government
authority,
that
seeks
to
call
a
national
bank
to
account
for
the
manner
in
which
it
is
conducting
an
expressly
designated,
allocated
banking
power
is
an
exercise
of
visitorial
power.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
--
the
state's
enforcement
of
any
law
that
is
directed
at
a
national
bank's
authorized
banking
powers
is
a
visitorial
power.
and
the
fact
that
it
may
also
be
characterized
as
a
police
power
or
a
lawsuit
is
--
is
interesting,
but
not
what's
at
stake.
what
congress
aimed
at
--
congress
in
1864
knew
--
the
supreme
court
said,
blackstone
and
kent
had
said
--
that
visitorial
powers
on
civil
corporations
are
exercised
a,
by
the
sovereign,
not
by
a
private
individual,
and
b,
are
almost
always
exercised
through
access
to
the
courts.
whether
they
are
invoking
the
courts'
authority
to
seek
records
or
not,
that
was
the
historical
core
of
what
visitorial
powers--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
correct.
and
a
sovereign
taking
a
national
bank
into
court
with
respect
to
not
any
old
general
law,
but
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
its
specifically
authorized
national
banking
powers,
is
the
exercise
of
visitorial
powers.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
was
the
reason
for
the
courts
of
justice
exception.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
don't
think
--
i
think
that
if
i
understood
your
question,
and
i
may
not
have
--
if
a
suit
by
a
private
individual
or
a
group
of
private
individuals
seeking
to
vindicate
the
deprivation
of
a
private
traditional
right
is
not
visitorial;
but
if
the
state,
either
directly
in
the
enforcement
of
its
general
laws
or
seeking
to
protect
the
people
of
its
state,
goes
into
court
or
asks
for
records
or
anything
else,
it
is
exercising
a
traditional
visitorial
power.
may
--
while
i
have
your
attention,
may
i
also
go
back
to
your
question
about
36(f)
and
riegle-neal,
because
there
is
yet
--
there
are
other
additional
indicators
that
when
the
congress
said
in
36(f)
that
these
state
laws
shall
be
enforced
by
the
occ,
it
was
mandatory
and
exclusive.
first
of
all,
the
colloquy
that
was
discussed
and
is
reported
in
our
brief,
i
think
at
page
26,
does
use
the
word
"enforce"
as
well
as
"supervise",
but
more
to
the
point--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
riegle-neal
--
here's
the
most
important
point.
that
provision
that
we've
been
were
looking
at
had
a
cognate,
had
an
analogue
that
was
also
enforced.
riegle-neal
basically
said
out-of-state
banks
can
now
branch
bank.
when
they
do
so,
they
are
subject
to
these
four
categories
of
state
laws.
the
provision
we
have
been
looking
at,
which
was
section
102,
said
with
respect
to
enforcement
of
those
laws,
the
occ
shall
enforce
it.
but
section
105
said
where
the
out-of-state
bank
is
a
state-chartered
bank
--
and
this
is
reported,
i
think
it's
at
section
1820(h)
of
title
12,
when
it's
a
state-chartered
bank,
the
state
authorities
of
the
host
state
shall
enforce
the
laws.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
so
it
enacted
a
dual
regime
that
demonstrates
exactly
what
congress
had
in
mind,
which
is
that
there
would
be
one
regulator
making
the
kind
of
judgments
about,
okay,
there
is
a
disparity,
but
let's
look
at
credit
history,
let's
look
at
the
loan
to
equity
value,
let's
look
at
income
versus
debt
incurred,
and
all
these
factors
that
the
occ
and
the
fed
have
explained
have
to
go
into
making
a
judgment
about
whether
or
not
a
particular
condition
of
a
particular
loan
violates
federal
law,
whether
it
the
fair
housing
act
or
the
equal
credit
opportunity
act
or
the
fed's
regulation
b.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
may
i
answer?
i
believe
that
it
would
if
those
incidental
authorities
are
in
fact
authorized,
approved
and
regulated
by
the
occ,
but
this
case
doesn't
require
you
to
address
it,
because
this
is
an
express
power
under
section
371(a).
