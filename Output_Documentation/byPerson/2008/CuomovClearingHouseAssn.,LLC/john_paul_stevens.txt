one
thing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--one
thing
puzzled
me
about
this.
they
are
not
pre-empting
any
new
york
laws;
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
we
ever
--
do
we
have
any
precedents
dealing
with
the
question
whether
preemption
of
the
right
to
enforce
a
valid
law
is
appropriate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
occ,
say,
has
very
limited
personnel
--
they
only
have
ten
people
in
their
enforcement
division,
for
example
--
and
congress
thought
they
have
to
get
more,
wouldn't
it
be
appropriate
in
that
background
to
say,
you
shall
start
enforcing?
and
that
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
you
are
excluding
states
from
also
enforcing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
naturally,
if
it's
state
laws,
clearly
they
can
look
at,
but
what
if
new
york
was
trying
to
enforce
its
discrimination
laws
in
an
employment
context
or
in
context
where
they
said
you
are
charging
minority
depositors
--
giving
them
lower
rates
of
interest
than
you
give
caucasian
depositors?
would
they
have
--
would
the
discrimination
and
the
rates
of
interests
paid
on
deposits
--
assume
that
was
the
question.
would
you
make
the
same
argument,
if
that
was
what
new
york
had
alleged?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
you
would
have
to
just
look
at
the
records.
you
can
tell
from
the
records
whether
people
of
different
classes
are
paying
different
--
are
getting
different
rates
on
their
deposits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
unlikely
to
persist.
maybe
it's
an
unlikely
example.
but
you
are
suggesting
that
that
would
also
interfere
with
the
comptroller's
ability
to
regulate
the
banks?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
waxman,
assume
--
assume
for
a
minute,
this
--
what
if
before
writing
the
letter,
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
said,
"we
have
conducted
500
interviews
with
people
who
have
borrowed
money
from
you,
and
on
the
basis
of
all
these
interviews
we
have
drawn
these
tentative
conclusions
that
there
is
discrimination.
"
"we
would
like
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
explain
all
of
this
by
showing
us
your
records.
"
and
they
say
no,
we
won't
do
it.
would
they
then
be
pre-empted
from
bringing
their
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
they
didn't
have
to
look
at
any
bank
record
to
make
their
prima
facie
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
asking
about
a
hypothetical.
i
understand
your
argument
here.
but
i
just
don't
understand
how
your
argument
would
apply
to
my
hypothetical.
but
i
think
the
regulation
would
apply
to
the
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
doesn't
even
want
to
look
at
your
books;
he
just
wants
to
prove
it
by
people
who
have
been
borrowing
money
and
compare
them
with
--
among
them
they
can
orally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
that
would
be
visitorial
power.
