justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
the
same
rule
would
not
apply
in
michigan
and
hawaii,
anyway,
even
under
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
acknowledges
that
michigan
can
have
its
own
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
hawaii
can
have
a
different
law.
all
the
federal
government
is
arguing
is:
we
want
to
be
the
ones
to
enforce
the
separate
michigan
law
and
the
separate
hawaii
law,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
deny,
do
you,
that
the
federal
government
can,
if
it
wishes,
enforce
the
state
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
provision
isn't
really
contrary
to
what
you
are
saying.
you
are
just
saying
the
state
can
do
it
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
was
your
position,
that
the
--
that
the
visitation
authority
includes
the
power
to
enforce
general
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
sovereign.
but
that
a
separate
action
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
sovereign
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
visitorial
powers
are
being
exercised.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
would
be
no
inconsistency,
if
you
believe
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait
a
minute.
i
--
this
is
state
law.
and
if
the
state
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
statute
means
a
certain
thing
and
that
certain
thing
is
a
little
bit
different
from
what
the
federal
antidiscrimination
law
is,
i
assume
that
the
federal
government
in
applying
state
law
has
to
--
has
to
take
that
difference
into
account,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
federal
government
doesn't
--
doesn't
have
the
right
to
alter
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
any
difference
whatever
in
that
regard
between
using
the
active
and
passive.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
state
law
applying
of
its
own
force,
just
as
your
second
example
was
not
state
law
applying
of
its
own
force.
it
was
state
law
that
had
been
converted
into
federal
law
by
the
federal
government's
adoption
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
arguing
for
conflict
pre-emption.
i
mean
that's
a
--
that's
a
different
issue
than,
say,
that
the
--
the
state
law
shouldn't
apply.
but
don't
tell
me
the
state
law
applies,
but
only
the
federal
government
is
--
what
incentive
does
the
federal
government
have
to
enforce
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
--
it
has
so
much
spare
time
after
enforcing
federal
law
that
it's
--
it's
going
to
be
worrying
about
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
conflict
pre-emption,
and
that
goes
to
the
--
to
the
law.
you
shouldn't
have
a
separate
state
law
that
--
that
provides
a
separate
standard
that
conflicts
with
the
federal
standard.
so
you
pre-empt
the
law.
you
don't
say
the
law
is
in
effect,
but
the
state
can't
enforce
it.
that's
a
weird
way
to
solve
that
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
there
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
--
would
you
acknowledge,
counsel,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
enforcing
state
laws
through
visitation
and
enforcing
state
laws
apart
from
visitation?
and
what
waters
involved
was
enforcing
state
laws
through
visitation.
of
course,
you
can
do
that
through
--
through
visitation
powers,
but
you
can
also
do
apart
from
that
by
bringing
a
lawsuit
or
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry,
did
i
skip
over
an
axis
here.
[laughter]
i
didn't
mean
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
underwood,
i
--
i
forgot
the
response
you
made
in
your
brief.
i
know
you
did
make
some
response
to
subsection
(b)
of
section
484.
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
explain
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
why
--
why
do
they
list
those
exceptions,
unless
one
would
think
that
everything
is
covered?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
if
--
if
enforcement
pre-emption
is
the
lesser
step,
we
probably
ought
to
revise
our
jurisprudence
so
as
not
to
tread
any
more
heavily
than
we
have
to
upon
the
states
so
that
where
there
is
conflict
pre-emption,
all
we
should
say
is
the
state
law
is
not
invalidated,
it
is
simply
not
enforceable?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
that
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
in
2005,
eliot
spitzer,
then
attorney
general
of
new
york
and
predecessor
in
office
to
andrew
cuomo,
the
petitioner
here,
sent
several
national
banks
what
was
called
a
“request
in
lieu
of
subpoena”
for
certain
non-public
information
about
their
lending
practices.
the
threatened
subpoena
was
not
a
judicial
subpoena
but
a
subpoena
that
new
york
executive
law
allowed
the
attorney
general
to
issue
on
his
own
authority
in
connection
with
his
investigation
of
business
practices.
in
this
case,
the
banks
compliance
with
new
york's
fair
lending
laws.
the
respondents
in
this
case,
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
a
trade
association
of
national
banks
brought
suit
to
enjoin
the
state
attorney
general
from
issuing
subpoenas
or
taking
any
other
action
to
enforce
the
state's
fair-lending
laws
against
national
banks.
the
district
court
issued
the
requested
injunction
and
the
second
circuit
affirmed.
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
is
the
executive
law
officer
charged
with
administration
of
the
national
bank
act.
that
legislation
passed
in
1864
provides
that
“no
national
bank
shall
be
subject
to
any
visitorial
powers
except
as
authorized
by
federal
law
or
vested
in
the
courts
of
justice.”
the
comptroller
promulgated
a
regulation
interpreting
this
statutory
term
visitorial
powers
to
prohibit
states
from
“conducting
examinations,
inspecting
or
requiring
the
production
of
books
or
records
of
national
banks,
or
prosecuting
enforcement
actions.”
it
is
a
familiar
principle
of
judicial
review
that
we
give
deference
so-called
chevron
deference,
named
after
the
case
that
adopted
that
principle,
to
agency
regulations
that
provide
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
ambiguous
statutory
provisions.
but
that
deference
is
not
boundless.
an
agency
cannot
go
beyond
what
is
ambiguous
and
contradict
the
clear
text
of
the
statute.
petitioner
contends
that
that
is
what
the
comptroller
has
done
here
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
visitorial
powers.
we
agree.
specifically,
we
think
the
comptroller
of
the
comptroller's
regulation
ignores
the
distinction
between
visitorial
and
non-visitorial
powers.
when
the
national
bank
act
was
passed,
visitorial
powers
were
understood
to
refer
to
the
power
of
the
state
as
sovereign
to
supervise
and
control
corporations.
the
state
as
visitor
could
inspect
corporate
books
and
records
at
any
time
for
any
reason.
the
visitorial
power
was
exercised
largely
through
use
of
the
now
outdated
prerogative
writs
such
as
mandamus
and
quo
warranto.
state
law
enforcement
in
the
courts
however
was
understood
to
represent
the
exercise
of
a
different
power,
separate
from
the
power
of
visitation.
unlike
the
visitorial
power,
it
comes
with
judicial
restraints
such
as
the
requirement
in
civil
cases
that
the
states
survived
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
availability
of
judicial
supervision
of
discovery.
this
distinction
between
visitorial
powers
and
law
enforcement
powers
is
reflected
in
the
national
bank
act
exclusion
from
preemption
of
powers
“vested
in
the
courts
of
justice”.
the
regulations
prohibition
of
prosecuting
enforcement
actions,
therefore
goes
beyond
what
the
national
bank
act
provides.
the
strange
effects
of
the
comptroller's
regulation
also
cast
doubt
upon
its
validity
or
agreed
that
some
state
laws
are
left
in
place
by
the
national
bank
act.
but
the
comptroller's
regulation
purports
to
preempt
all
enforcement
of
even
valid
state
laws.
the
bark
of
state
law
remains,
but
its
bite
does
not.
this
is
a
strange
result.
as
we
noted
in
a
similar
context
in
a
1924
case,
“to
demonstrate
the
binding
quality
of
a
statute
but
deny
the
power
of
enforcement
involves
a
fallacy
made
apparent
by
the
mere
statement
of
the
proposition,
for
such
power
is
essentially
inherent
in
the
very
conception
of
law.”
the
comptroller
attempts
to
remedy
this
problem
or
at
least
to
narrow
it
by
saying
in
the
statement
of
basis
and
purpose
that
a
company
promulgation
of
his
regulation
that
the
prohibition
of
state
enforcement
does
not
apply
to
such
matters
as
“taxation,
zoning,
criminal
and
tort
law”
which
establish
“the
legal
infrastructure
that
surrounds
and
supports
the
ability
of
national
banks
to
do
business”.
this
distinction
between
implementation
of
infrastructure
and
enforcement
of
other
laws
finds
no
basis
in
the
statute
or
even
in
the
text
of
the
regulation.
in
sum,
the
comptroller
was
not
unreasonable
in
interpreting
the
national
bank
act's
prohibition
on
state
exercise
of
visitorial
powers
to
include
“conducting
examinations
and
inspecting
or
requiring
the
production
of
books
or
records
of
national
banks”.
but
exceeded
the
balance
of
reasonable
interpretation
by
prohibiting
the
states
from
“prosecuting
enforcement
actions”
against
national
banks.
we
therefore
uphold
the
injunction
as
applied
to
the
new
york
attorney
general's
threatened
issuance
of
an
executive
subpoena
but
vacate
its
application
to
the
bringing
of
judicial
enforcement
actions.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
kennedy
and
justice
alito
have
joined.
