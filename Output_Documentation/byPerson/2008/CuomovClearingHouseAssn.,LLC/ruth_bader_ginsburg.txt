justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
to
some
extent,
would
you
concede
that
interpretation;
that
is,
not
only
the
attorney
general
under
new
york's
law,
but
the
superintendent
of
banks
as
well,
has
authority
over
mortgage
lending?
would
--
would
you
agree
that
the
part
about
the
bank
superintendent's
enforcement
could
not
be
enforced
against
national
banks?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
--
the
provision
that
you
are
talking
about,
296(a),
concerns
the
authority
of
the
bank
superintendent
as
well
as
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general;
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
with
respect
to
the
same
issue
on
mortgage
lending
where
there's
a
concern
about
racial
discrimination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
anything?
and
you
agree
to
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
if
the
new
york
statute--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
we
clarify
one
thing
about
the
50
jurisdictions?
the
attorney
general
from
new
york
is
not
asserting
authority
over
bank
lending
in
hawaii.
so
for
each
institution,
i
assume
it's
going
to
be
two
sovereigns,
the
occ
and
the
state
attorney
general,
not
50
descending
on
the
single
--
single
bank
with
respect
to
particular
loans?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
come
to
the
new
york
attorney
general.
i
see
your
argument
that
there's
a
certain
incongruity
between
saying
private
attorneys
general
okay,
but
no
public
attorney
general.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
attorney
general
starts
out
by
asking
for
bank
books
and
records.
and
high
on
the
list
of
visitorial
powers
is
the
authority
to
demand
the
bank's
books
and
records.
so
why
isn't
that
--
his
preliminary
investigation
at
least,
why
doesn't
that
fit
within
the
visitorial
power
bundle?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
it
is
a
given
in
this
case
--
and
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong
on
this
--
that
the
state
substantive
law
is
not
pre-empted.
you
refer,
i
think,
to
enforcement
pre-emption;
that
is,
the
state
law
is
governing
law.
but
the
only
enforcer
is
federal
authority;
and
if
that's
so,
is
there
any
other
--
in
all
of
federal-state
relations,
any
other
law
where
the
state
as
sovereign
can
prescribe
but
cannot
enforce?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
because
--
because
it's
picking
a
rate.
it's
not
saying
there
is
the
federal
law
and
it
has
this
rate,
and
the
state
law
that
has
that
rate.
here,
the
equal
credit
opportunity
act,
a
federal
act,
undoubtedly
applies.
and
that
is
proper
federal
--
federal
law
enforced
by
the
federal
authorities.
the
state
law,
as
this
picture
is
drawn
for
us,
is
applicable.
it's
substantive
law
applicable
to
these
banks,
but
only
the
federal
authority
can
enforce
it.
that
seems
passing
strange.
and
do
you
have
an
example
outside
the
--
the
two
you
gave
us
in
the
national
bank
act
where
the
state
prescribes
but
the
federal
authorities
enforce?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
do
you
think
the
same
answer
whether
--
justice
stevens
mentioned
employment
discrimination.
the
state
has
reason
to
believe
the
bank
is
discriminating
in
its
employment
policies,
and
it
wants
to
examine
certain
employment
records
in
that
connection.
would
you
say
also
that,
although
new
york
can
prescribe
its
antidiscrimination
in
employment
law,
it
can't
enforce
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
your
mention
of
watters,
which
has
been
mentioned
in
the
briefs,
i
think
is
an
inaccurate
description
of
what
that
opinion
held.
watters
dealt
with
a
regime
that
was
indisputably
visitorial.
it
was
a
registration
regime,
where
annual
fees
were
paid,
annual
reports
were
filed
with
the
state
financial
agency,
and
the
state
monitor
could
go
into
a
lending
organization
any
time
for
any
reason
without
any
suspicion
of
wrongdoing.
the
only
--
so
everyone
agreed
that
was
a
visitorial
regime.
the
sole
question
was
whether
the
banks
--
the
national
bank's
operating
subsidiary
was
to
be
equated
with
a
division
of
the
national
bank.
that
was
the
only
question
provided
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
in
the
context
of
a
state
law
that
says,
mortgage
lending
institution,
you
may
not
lend
unless
you
register
and
do
all
the
rest.
that
was
the
context
of
watters.
and
i
do
not
think
that
excerpts
from
that
opinion
should
be
taken
out
of
that
context,
which
was:
you
can't
be
in
this
business
unless
you
register
with
us.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
one
could
say,
yes,
the
federal
authorities
have
visitorial
powers,
and
they
can
go
to
court.
but
we
have
here
that
the
state
can
prescribe,
not
a
supervisory
regime,
but
--
fair
lending.
and
the
state
wants
to
go
into
court
and
say
the
bank
is
violating
the
state
substantive
law,
which
is
applicable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
you
are
talking
about
lending.
and
like
depositing,
those
are
core
banking
activities,
but
today
national
banks
have
a
lot
of
incidental
--
they
have
authority
to
do
things
incidental
to
banking.
does
your
restriction
of
state
enforcement
extend
to
those
matters
incidental
to
banking?
