mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
explain
the
threat
that
the
occ
believes
the
state's
enforcement
regime
poses
to
the
national
banking
system
and
occ's
administration
of
that
system,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
going
back
to
a
colloquy
between
ms.
underwood
and
justice
breyer
near
the
beginning
of
the
argument.
and
justice
breyer
raised
the
possibility
that
a
myriad
of
state
attorneys
general
would
file
--
would
pursue
similar
antidiscrimination
claims,
and
ms.
underwood's
response
was
there
really
would
be
no
problem
because
they
are
all
applying
the
same
substantive
standard.
and
i
think
at
a
very
high
level
of
generality
that
is
so;
that
is,
the
federal
statute
and
the
state
statute
both
say
no
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
in
extensions
of
credit.
but
i
think
when
you
get
to
the
way
in
which
the
statutes
are
administered,
there
is
at
least
the
potential
for
significant
differences,
because--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
would--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
federal
government
wouldn't
have
the
right
to
alter
state
law.
the
federal
government
would
have
the
authority
to
make
its
own
assessment
of
whether
the
state
law
was
pre-empted
based
upon
those
distinctions.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
give
two
examples
from
the
national
banking
system,
itself.
the
first
is
the
riegle-neal
amendments,
which
justice
souter
was
alluding
to.
and
the
amendments
don't
simply
say
that
occ
shall
enforce
non-pre-empted
state
laws.
it
says
that
those
laws
shall
be
enforced
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
think
so
with
the
"shall"
in
combination
with
the
passive
voice.
that
is,
if
you
had
a
statute
that
said
a
certain
category
of
suits
shall
be
adjudicated
by
the
court
of
federal
claims,
i
think
that
would
mean
not
simply
that
the
court
of
federal
claims
would
be
required
to
adjudicate
them
if
a
case
was
brought
before
it,
but
i
think
that
would
unmistakably
identify
the
court
of
federal
claims
as
the
exclusive
tribunal--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
agree
that
if
the
statute
simply
--
if
the
statute
used
the
active
voice
and
said
the
occ
shall
enforce
these
laws,
there
would
be
a
better
argument
that
the
occ's
authority
was
not
exclusive.
but
when
the
statute
said
--
says
these
laws
shall
be
enforced
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
i
think
the
clear
implication
is
this
is
the
exclusive
mechanism
by
which
the
laws--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
let
me
give
you
another
example
from
the
national
banking
system,
and
that
is
12
u.s.c.
85.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
let
me
just
give
you
a
second
example
very
quickly.
12
u.s.c.
section
85,
which
was
an
issue
in
smiley,
deals
with
the
maximum
rate
of
interest
that
national
banks
may
charge,
and
it
says
that
they
may
charge
as
much
as
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
they
are
located
allows
and
no
more.
and
that
is
a
similar
system
in
that
to
determine
the
maximum
rate
of
interest
that
the
bank
may
charge,
you
look
to
state
law.
you
defer
to
the
choice
of
the
state
legislature,
but
the
enforcement
regime
with
respect
to
administrative
enforcement
is
exclusively
federal.
it's
only
the
federal
authorities
that
can
go
after--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
another
example
would
be
the
similar
crimes
act,
which
provides
for
the
incorporation
of
state
law
with
respect
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--those
provisions--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--those
provisions
do
accomplish
incorporation
of
state
law
as
federal
law.
but
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
most
recently
in
watters,
that
state
law
applies
to
national
banks
only
insofar
as
congress
shall
see
fit
to
permit
it.
so--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
is
certainly
true,
that
the
--
the
state's
exercise
of
remedial
discretion
may
be
different
from
the
federal
government's.
but
even
before
that
stage,
if
you
look
at
the
letters
in
the
joint
appendix
that
the
new
york
attorney
general's
office
sent
to
the
national
banks
in
question,
basically
the
thrust
of
the
letters
was:
we
have
identified
what
we
believe
to
be
troubling
statistical
disparities
in
terms
of
the
terms
on
which
the
credit
was
offered
to
applicants
of
different
races.
if
those
disparities
are
not
satisfactorily
explained,
that
it
--
you
may
be
in
violation
of
state
fair
lending
laws.
therefore,
give
us
a
wide
variety
of
information
that
would
allow
us
to
determine
whether
you
have
a
satisfactory
explanation.
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
had
this
process
been
allowed
to
run
its
course,
what
the
new
york
attorney
general's
office
was
going
to
do
was
assess
the
bank's
own
criteria
for
making
lending
decisions
to
decide
whether
those
criteria
were
suitable
and
decide,
therefore,
whether
they
provided
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
the
statistical
disparities
that
had
been
observed.
and
once
the
new
york
a.g.
is
in
the
business
of
passing
upon
the
adequacy
of
the
bank's
lending
criteria,
he
is
right
on
the
--
the
occ's--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
point
that
has
been
made
at
various
times
in
the
argument
that
the
state
law
basically
tracks
federal
law,
i
think,
is
an
answer
to
that
question;
that
is,
whatever
incentive
the
federal
government
might
have
to
enforce
idiosyncratic
features
of
state
law
that
didn't
have
a
federal
analogue.
here
the
state
law
in
question
prohibits
discriminatory
practices
that
are
already
prohibited
by
federal
law.
so
whether
occ
and
hud
set
out
to
enforce
state
law,
if
they
are
vigorously
enforcing
federal
law,
they
will
in
the
course
of
doing
that
vindicate
the
state's
prerogatives.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
they
--
they
don't
say
it
in
--
with
quite
that
degree
of
clarity,
but
there
is
a
colloquy
quoted
in
the
--
the
brief
for
the
clearing
house
between
--
i
believe
it's
senator
d'amato
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
it
is
--
it
is
to
the
effect
that
senator
d'amato
expresses
the
concern
that
this
may
subject
the
--
the
national
banks
in
their
branch
activities
to
state
supervision.
and
the
response
is
that's
not
the
case.
that
will
happen
with
branches
of
state
banks,
but
with
respect
to
branches
of
national
banks
the
supervision
will
be
by
the
occ.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
section
36(f)(1)(a)
refers
to
a
very
limited
category
of
state
laws
that
include
state
fair
lending
laws
and
said
these
laws
will
not
be
pre-empted
unless
they
would
be
pre-empted
with
respect
to
national
banks
generally.
and
then
36(f)(1)(b)
says
the
laws
in
that
preceding
paragraph
shall
be
enforced
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency.
and
so
even
if
the
colloquy
used
the
term
"supervision",
the
focus
of
the
statutory
language
was
--
was
on
a
pretty
narrow
category
of
laws.
i
would
like
also
to
refer
the
court
to
12
u.s.c.
484(b),
which
i
think
is
relevant
here,
and
it
is
on
page
1a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
and
it
is
an
express
exception
to
the
general
rule
against
the
exercise
of
visitorial
powers.
and
it
says,
"notwithstanding
subsection
(a)
of
this
section,
lawfully
authorized
state
auditors
and
examiners
may
at
reasonable
times
and
upon
reasonable
notice
to
a
bank
review
its
records
solely
to
ensure
compliance
with
applicable
state
unclaimed
property
or
escheat
laws.
"
now,
the
basic
thrust
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that
would
be
the
implication
of
the
provision,
but
the
significant
point
for
our
purposes
is
that
it
refers
solely
to
ensure
compliance
with
applicable
state
unclaimed
property
or
escheat
laws.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
we
would
because
that
would
be
going
to
the
banks'
federally
authorized
banking--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
it
might
be
that
in
that
instance
the
discrimination
would
be
unlikely
to
persist,
but
the
basic--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes,
the
way
the
regulation
is
written,
it
speaks
to
state
efforts
to
enforce
laws
that
are
directed
at
the
bank's
federally
authorized
banking
activities.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
the
regulation
does
sweep
more
categorically
with
respect
to
inspection
of
bank
records.
new
york
would
not
be
forbidden
to
file
lawsuits
to
enforce
its
employment
discrimination
laws.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
a
certain--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
part
of
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
was,
even
if
the
substantive
state
law
on
its
face
is
not
pre-empted
because
it
is
identical
to
the
federal
law,
once
we
get
to
the
enforcement
stage
where
the
relevant
enforcement
agency
is
saying
your
statistical
disparity
constitutes
a
violation
because
it
is
not
justified
by
sound
banking
practices,
inevitably
that
judgment
is
going
to
put
the
state
regulator
in
the
business
of
doing
what
occ
does.
and
if
50
different
state
attorneys
general
have
slightly
different
ideas
of
what
constitutes
an
adequate
banking
justification
for
lending
criteria
that
produces
statistical
disparity,
then
the
problem
is
multiplied.
then--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
other
point
i
would
make
about
this
is
that
it
is
accurate
to
say
that
under
the
federal
regime
the
state
is
entirely
disabled
from
enforcing
its
own
fair
lending
law.
as
ms.
underwood
alluded
to
in
the
opening
part
of
the
argument
and
as
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
explains
at
pages
25
and
26,
the
fair
housing
act
does
contain
a
mechanism
by
which
a
state
agency
--
in
the
case
of
new
york,
it's
the
division
of
human
resources
--
can
be
certified
by
hud
to
enforce
the
state
fair
lending
laws.
but
that
certification
entails
two
different
steps:
first,
hud
has
to
determine
that
the
substantive
state
law
is
--
i
believe
it's
substantially
equivalent
to
the
comparable
federal
law.
and,
second,
hud
monitors
the
performance
of
the
enforcing
agency,
the
particular
agency
under
state
law
that
carries
out
that
responsibility,
and
hud
can
thereby
make
sure
that
enforcement
as
well
as
the
substance
of
the
law
are
consistent
with
federal
law.
