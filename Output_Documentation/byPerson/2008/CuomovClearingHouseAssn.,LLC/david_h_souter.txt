but
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
general
--
in
the
field
of
criminal
enforcement
generally
there
isn't
any
provision
comparable
to
what
is
now
36(f)(1)(b),
at
least
to
my
knowledge,
and
it's
set
out
on
pages
46
and
47,
the
text
is
in
the
government's
brief:
"the
provisions
of
any
state
law
to
which
a
branch
of
a
national
bank
is
subject
under
this
paragraph
shall
be
enforced
with
respect
to
such
branch
by
the
occ.
"
and
that
mandate,
it
"shall
be
enforced
with
respect
to
such
branch.
"
sounds
pretty
exclusive
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can't
tell
for
sure.
but
why
would
--
why
would
congress,
number
one,
if
it
--
if
congress
simply
assumed
that
there
would
be
a
--
a
dual
system
of
enforcement,
that
occ
could
--
could
say
to
the
bank,
you
follow
state
law,
and
if
you
don't,
we
are
going
to
go
after
you
administratively,
and
leaving
it
to
the
state
to
go
after,
in
any
other
fashion,
what
state
law
provided.
if
that
was
congress's
assumption,
why
would
it
have
--
have
passed
this
seeming
mandate,
"shall
be
enforced
with
respect
to
such
branch.
"
by
the
--
by
the
occ?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
--
that's,
in
effect,
saving
clause
kind
of
function
could
have
been
performed
simply
by
a
statute
that
says
occ
may.
and
this
says
it
shall
be
enforced
by
occ.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say
about
the
quotations
in
the
--
the
brief
that
mr.
waxman
filed,
as
i
recall;
it
may
have
been
the
government's
brief--
justice
david
h.
souter
--which
--
which
do
have
references
to
visitorial
powers
as
including
general
conformance
to
the
law.
those
are
not
universal
provisions,
but
they
--
they
were
certainly
understood
in
some
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
there
was
--
there
was
a
point
in
--
in
distinguishing
the
visitorial
powers
that
blackstone,
in
the
cases
blackstone
was
referring
to,
and
those
for
example
that
would
apply
solely
to
--
to
religious
or
originally
religious
foundations
like
oxford
and
cambridge
colleges
and
so
on.
so
there
--
there
seems
to
have
been
a
reason
to
understand
the
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
didn't
need
visitorial
powers
to
do
that.
i
mean,
the
sovereign
had
that
by
virtue
of
the
general
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
do
you
--
do
you
agree
that
--
that
it
is
possible
to
read
the
occ,
but
not
necessarily
as
an
exclusive
ground?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
want
you
to
come
back.
i
--
i
won't
stop
--
i
don't
want
to
stop
you
from
doing
that,
but
i
want
to
come
back
to
this.
do
you
--
do
you
want
to
go
on
to
your
second
example,
or
do
you
want
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
there
any
--
is
there
any
legislative
history
whatever
to
the
effect
that
at
the
time
36(f)(1)(b)
was
adopted
--
to
the
effect
that
its
effect
was
to
pre-empt
state
enforcement
for--
justice
david
h.
souter
--senator
d'amato
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
the
--
the
problem
i
have
with
that
is,
as
a
--
as
a
kind
of
clear
statement
of
--
of
something
which
is
--
is
--
would
be
extraordinary
--
is
that
it
talks
in
terms
of
supervision.
it
doesn't
use
the
--
my
recollection
is
it
doesn't
use
the
magic
word
"enforcement".
and
i
would
have
thought
that
if
in
the
course
of
that
colloquy
the
--
the
statement
had
been
made:
the
states
will
not
have
the
authority
to
enforce
this,
that
there
would
have
been
rather
a
dust-up.
and
there
wasn't.
it's
kind
of
a
"dog
that
didn't
bark"
argument.
and,
therefore,
if
--
if
there
is
uncertainty
as
to
how
to
construe
36(f)(1)(b),
i'm
not
sure
that
i
--
i
don't
think
the
legislative
history
supports
your
exclusivity
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
that
mean
--
when
they
say
"review
records",
does
that
mean
that
the
state
auditors
in
effect
can
walk
into
the
bank,
as
distinguished
from
what
we
have
here,
in
which
the
bank
is
being
requested
to
produce
excerpts
from
records?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
is
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
it
the
exercise
of
visitorial
powers,
or
is
it
an
action
which
covers
the
same
subject
that
an
exercise
of
visitorial
powers
would
do?
let
me
--
let
me
propose
a
distinction,
and
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
sound.
you
know
--
i
mean,
you
tell
me.
i
would
suppose
that
if
someone
with
visitorial
powers
dealing
with
discrimination
in
lending
brought
an
action
against
the
bank
or
tried
to
enforce
it
against
the
bank
and
couldn't
do
so
in
any
other
way
then
by
going
to
court,
it
would
go
to
court,
and
it
would
say
court,
tell
this
institution
that
i
have
some
responsibility
for,
to
obey
the
law.
but
i
also
assume
that
if
the
attorney
general
of
new
york,
which
is
not
a
visitor,
enforces
the
law,
it
would
go
into
court
and
say
tell
them
to
obey
the
law
and
to
pay
damages
or
recompense
of
some
sort
to
these
people
whom
they
have
wronged.
the
subject
matter
of
each
suit
is
the
same,
but
the
relief
that
is
being
requested
and
the
judicial
power
that
is
being
exercised
is
different
in
these
two
cases.
is
that
a
fair
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
the
one
with
senator
d'amato?
justice
david
h.
souter
uh-huh.
