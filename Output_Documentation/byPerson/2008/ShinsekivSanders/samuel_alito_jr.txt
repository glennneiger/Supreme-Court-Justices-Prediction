justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
--
can
i
ask
you
to
clarify
exactly
what
you
mean
by
the
"burden"
of
showing
prejudice?
is
it
correct
that
neither
of
the
following
--
to
borrow
the
terminology
that
you
would
use
in
formal
litigation,
and
i
understand
this
is
not
formal
litigation
before
an
agency,
but
to
borrow
that
terminology,
is
it
correct
that
the
issue
here
doesn't
concern
either
the
burden
of
production
or
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion
before
the
administrative
agency,
before
the
regional
office?
in
other
words,
if
there's
--
if
there
is
evidence
that
the
veteran
as
opposed
to
the
va
has
to
produce,
that
doesn't
change,
and
whatever
the
standard
is
that
has
to
be
met
to
show
an
entitlement
to
benefits,
that
doesn't
change
either,
so
that
all
that's
involved
here
is
whether
--
whatever
showing
needs
to
be
made
is
to
be
made
on
appeal
or
on
remand?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
--
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
is
that
--
why
is
it
a
speculative
enterprise?
it's
--
if
the
--
if
you
are
correct,
and
the
proper
resolution
in
a
case
like
this
is
a
remand,
let's
say
all
the
way
back
to
the
regional
office,
and
if
before
the
regional
office
it's
the
veteran
who
will
need
to
come
forward
with
some
evidence
supporting
the
claim,
why
does
it
make
sense
to
remand
the
case
to
the
regional
office
if
there
is
no
possibility
that
when
the
case
gets
back
there
the
veteran
can
come
forward
with
medical
evidence
that's
needed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
you
have
the
situation
--
and
i
think
actually
your
--
your
co-respondent's
case
illustrates
this
better
than
yours.
but
you
have
a
situation
where
the
record
as
it
has
developed
contains
some
evidence
that
supports
the
--
the
veteran's
position,
some
evidence
that
supports
the
position
in
favor
of
denial
of
benefits.
the
--
the
veterans
administration,
all
the
way
up
through
the
process,
finds
that
the
evidence
contrary
to
the
veteran's
position
is
much
stronger
and
denies
the
claim
on
that
basis.
the
veteran
says:
i
didn't
get
notice
of
what
exactly
i
needed
to
prove.
now,
if
on
remand
to
the
regional
office
it's
still
going
to
be
--
it's
going
to
be
up
to
the
veteran
to
come
forward
with
medical
evidence
showing
hearing
loss
or
vision
--
connecting
the
vision
loss
to
something
that
happened
in
the
service,
why
does
it
make
sense
to
send
it
back
if
there's
no
possibility
that
the
veteran
is
going
to
be
able
to
do
that
when
the
case
gets
back?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
why
doesn't
it
make
sense
in
your
case?
i
think
this
illustrates
what
is
troubling
to
me
about
the
federal
circuit's
decision,
but
maybe
i
am
missing
a
point.
your
client
was
denied
benefits
for
failure
to
show
a
causal
connection,
to
show
that
his
--
his
vision
loss
is
service-related.
he
provided
evidence
from
two
private
ophthalmologists
or
optometrists
providing
very
weak
causes
--
evidence
of
causation.
one
said
it
was
not
inconceivable
that
this
was
the
cause
of
it.
he
was
examined
by
two
va
doctors,
who
said
it
was
more
likely
that
this
was
caused
by
a
post-service
infection
rather
than
by
an
explosion
while
he
was
in
--
while
he
was
in
the
service.
now,
if
the
case
--
if
the
notice
was
defective,
why
does
it
not
make
sense
to
say
to
your
client,
show
us
that
you
can
come
up
with
some
medical
evidence
that
shows
that
this
is
service-related,
something
more
than
a
doctor
who
says
it's
not
inconceivable?
then
it
makes
sense
to
remand
it.
but
if
you
can't
do
it
on
appeal,
what
sense
does
it
make
to
remand
it,
where
the
same
failure
to
provide
evidence
is
going
to
doom
his
claim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
position
--
your
position
seems
to
be
not
that
the
government
should
have
to
show
prejudice,
but
as
applied
to
a
case
like
yours,
that
there's
an
irrebuttable
presumption
of
prejudice.
what
could
the
government
show?
that
there
--
they
would
have
to
show
that
there
is
not
a
single
ophthalmologist
in
the
country
who,
if
he
or
she
examined
mr.
sanders,
would
find
that
the
--
that
the
vision
loss
was
attributable
to
a
bazooka
explosion
in
world
war
ii?
