justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
miller,
could
you
help
me
out
on
how
the
system
works
in
--
in
practice
in
a
different
way?
one
of
your
answers
a
few
moments
ago
was
that
when
--
i
think
it
was
ms.
simmons
was
told
why
she
lost,
she
in
effect
got
as
much
notice
as
she
would
have
needed
to
have
to
in
effect
do
better
on
a
remand.
my
first
question
is:
is
there
an
automatic
right
to
a
remand?
justice
david
h.
souter
with
new
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
even
on
the
--
on
the
functioning
of
the
system
as
you
have
explained
it,
at
the
--
at
the
very
least,
the
person
has
--
let's
assume
ms.
simmons
says:
oh,
now
i
understand,
and
i
will
get
the
following
piece
of
evidence,
which
i
didn't
realize
was
my
responsibility.
even
on
that
explanation,
it
means
that
the
--
that
the
claimant
is
going
to
have
to
go
through
another
stage
in
the
administrative
litigation
process.
so
i
assume
that
ought
to
count
as
--
as
some
sort
of
prejudice,
and
i
assume
it's
something
that
--
as
it
were,
the
burden
of
which
the
va
ought
to
bear
rather
than
the
claimant.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
are
going
to
have
to
go
through
another
stage
of
litigation.
i
mean,
one
of
the
functions
of
the
burden
rule
--
and
it
might
be
too
subtle
a
function
to
worry
much
about
--
but
one
of
the
functions
is
to
put
the
party
with
the
burden
on
--
on
notice
that
if
you
fail
in
your
obligation,
you're
the
one
who
is
going
to
have
to
pay,
unless
you
can
convince
everybody
that
there
was
in
fact
no
harm
done
by
this.
and
this
induces
the
party
with
the
burden
to
do
what
the
primary
obligation
says
the
party
ought
to
do.
and
on
your
--
and
on
your
analysis,
since
the
government
would
not
have
that
obligation,
the
government
has
less
of
an
inducement
to
follow
the
statutory
obligation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
have
a
strong
inducement,
but
i'm
talking
about
a
stronger
one.
[laughter]
if
the
government
knows
that
it
is
going
to
bear
the
burden
of
any
doubt
about
the
significance
of
its
failure,
to
some
extent
i
suppose
that
is
--
that
is
going
to
induce
the
government
to
be
on
its
toes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
--
i
mean,
that's
the
essential
problem
with
common
law
adjudication.
and
i
--
there's
not
much
we
can
do
about
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
at
that
point,
is
the
claimant
disentitled
to
have
a
lawyer?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
at
the
point
they
get
the
notice
and
they
are
trying
to
evaluate
the
significance
of
the
notice,
they
are
not
entitled
to
a
lawyer?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no
--
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
at
the
point
--
at
the
point
where
the
statute
requires
original
notice,
they
are
not
entitled
to
a
lawyer.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
--
we
agree
on
that.
now,
they've
gone
through
stage
one
of
litigation
and
they've
lost.
and
they
are
getting
a
statement
of
reasons.
at
that
point,
are
they
entitled
to
have
a
lawyer?--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
whether
--
i
--
i
guess
the
--
the
situation
that
i
am
concerned
with
is,
the
person
up
to
that
moment
not
only
does
not
have,
but
is
not
entitled
to
have,
a
lawyer.
the
person
then
gets
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
mail
that
says:
you
lost;
these
are
the
reasons.
if
the
person
--
if
the
claimant
then
says,
i
don't
know
what
they
are
talking
about,
i
will
go
get
a
lawyer,
then
i
can
understand
at
that
point
a
relatively
sophisticated
mind
is
going
to
come
in
to
understand
it.
but
if
the
client
simply
reads
it
and
says,
i
really
don't
know
what
they
are
talking
about
here
or
at
least
i
think
i
know
what
they
are
talking
about,
and
i
guess
it's
hopeless,
the
person
is
not
likely
to
have
legal
advice.
and
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
the
person
at
that
stage,
at
the
moment
the
notice
arrives,
is
in
a
position,
i
would
think,
of
--
of
extreme
relative
disadvantage.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can
see
where
i
am
going
with
the
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
there's
--
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
points
at
which
the
veteran
is
at
a
disadvantage.
and
--
and
you're
talking
about
the
second
of
the
two.
i'm
talking
about
the
first
of
the
two.
and
the
first
of
the
two
is
the
point
at
which
the
veteran
--
i
mean,
following
the
hearing,
the
veteran
gets
the
notice
and
the
veteran
is
not
in
a
very
sophisticated
position
to
evaluate
what
the
veteran
is
being
told.
