mr.
eric
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
congress
has
directed
the
veterans
court
to
take
due
account
of
the
rule
of
prejudicial
error
in
reviewing
administrative
determinations
of
veterans
benefits.
for
four
reasons,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
the
veterans
court
should
presume
the
existence
of
prejudice
whenever
it
finds
that
the
va
has
erred
in
providing
notice
to
a
claimant.
first,
section
7261,
the
veterans
court
prejudicial
error
statute,
uses
language
that
is
essentially
identical
to
that
of
the
apa's
prejudicial
error
provision.
and
when
congress
adopted
that
language
in
1988,
it
was
understood
to
place
upon
the
party
challenging
an
agency's
action
the
burden
of
showing
that
any
error
was
prejudicial.
second,
a
notice
error
of
the
kind
at
issue
here
does
not
have
the
natural--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the
principal
reason
that
it
was
understood
is
because
the
uniform
practice
in
the
courts
of
appeals
as
of
1988
was
to
place
upon
challengers
to
agency
action
the
burden
of
showing
prejudice
from
the
error.
and
the
congress
was
well
aware
of
that,
and
in
particular
the
senate
veterans
affairs
committee,
in
explaining
its
choice
of
the
rule,
cited
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
seine
&
line
fishermen's
union,
which
expressly
stated
that
the
burden--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
your
honor,
it's
considerably
more
than
that.
and
the
only
--
and
the
only
cases
that
even
suggest
--
that
lend
any
support
to
a
contrary
rule
are
in
the
very
different
context
of
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
under
rule
--
under
section
553.
and
the
reason
that
that's
different
is
really
for
two
reasons,
and
that
is
that
the
--
the
interest
that
section
553
is
intended
to
protect
is
not
the
interest
of
any
particular
commenter
or
any
particular
outcome
of
the
rulemaking.
it's
the
interest
of
the
public
in
having
the
agency's
decisionmaking
fully
informed
by
all
of
the
relevant
comments.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the
reason
that
in
a
great
many
cases
there's
not
going
to
be
prejudice
from
error
of
the
kind
at
issue
here
is
that
the
va
has
an
informal
nonadversarial
system
that
provides
multiple
layers
of
review
and
many
opportunities
to
correct
the
effect
of
any
official
notice
error.
and
that's
illustrated
by
the
procedural
history
of
these
cases.
to
take
ms.
simmons's
case
for
an
example--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
correct.
this
court
has
not
held
that.
but
congress
was
aware
that
the
uniform
practice,
certainly
in
agency
adjudications
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
was
to
place
the
burden
on
the
challengers,
and
congress--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no,
the
statute
at
issue
here
is
part
of
the
veterans
judicial
review
act
of
1988.
and
so
the
relevant
time
we're
looking
at
what
the
practice
was
is
as
of
1988
when
congress
incorporated
the
language
from
the
apa
and
placed
it
in
section
7261.
and
as
of
1988,
it
was
clear
that
the
burden
was
on
challengers.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
--
that's
correct.
we
are
talking
about
what
showing
needs
to
be
made
on
appeal.
and
as
this
court
suggested
in
o'neal,
you
know,
the
burden
language
is
perhaps
more
appropriate
for
the
context
where
there's
--
you
know,
people
are
presenting
competing
evidentiary
submissions
to
a
factfinder,
and
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
right.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
to
clarify,
the
reason
that
we
have
used
the
language
of
"burden"
is
simply--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
appreciate
that.
i
--
the
point
that
we're
trying
to
emphasize
is
that,
in
the
ordinary
course,
the
veterans
court,
like
any
court,
is
going
to
act
on
the
basis
of
arguments
that
are
presented
to
it
by
the
parties.
and
so
when
we
--
when
we
speak
of
a
"burden",
we
mean
that
the
challenger
has
the
obligation,
if
it
wants
the
veterans
court
to
find
prejudice,
to
articulate
some
theory
of
how
there
was
prejudice.
and
that--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--but
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
connect
that
error
--
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
an
identification
of
an
error
under
the
veterans
claims
assistance
act.
but
to
connect
that
error
to
some--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--if
he
has
something
more.
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
in
order
to
get
a
remand,
the
claimant
who,
by
the
time
they
get
to
the
veterans
court,
has
already
identified
the
error,
has
made
an
argument
to
explain
to
the
court
that
there
was
in
fact
an
error,
at
that
point
they
ought
to
explain
how
the
error
affected
them.
if
it
prevented
them
from
putting
some
piece
of
evidence,
they
ought
to
tell
the
court:
here's
the
piece
of
evidence
that
i
would
have
put
in.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
because
i
think
in
a
case
where
the
--
like
these,
where
plaintiff
has
not
identified
anything
that
they
would
have
done
differently,
it
isn't
a
close
case
with
respect
to
the
question
of
prejudice.
now,
we
have
to
be
clear:
if
a
claimant
can
articulate
something
they
would
have
done
differently,
we
are
not
saying
they
have
the
obligation
of
showing
that
the
outcome
definitely
would
have
been
different
or
even,
more
likely
than
not,
it
would
have
been
different.
it
would
be
sufficient
after
identifying
with
some
particularity
what
they
would
have
done
differently,
if
they
could
show
that
there's
some
reasonable--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
depending
on
the
state
of
a
record
--
the
record
in
a
particular
case,
that
might
be
sufficient
to
show
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
outcome
would
have
been
different.
but
in
a
lot
of
cases
it
won't
be,
and
i
think
ms.
simmons's
case
is
a
good
example
of
that.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
mean,
had
the
government
complied
--
to
take
simmons's
case
as
an
example,
when
the
va
sent
her
the
notice
letter,
her
claim
was
for
an
increased
rating.
she
had
a
hearing
loss
that
had
already
been
determined
to
be
service-connected
but
was
not
sufficiently
severe
to
be
compensable,
and
she
said:
my
hearing
has
gotten
worse.
it
now
is
severe
enough
to
be
a
compensable
disability.
the
notice
letter
that
was
sent
to
her,
which
is
at
page
43
of
the
joint
appendix,
was
incorrect
in
that
it
simply
described
the
general
requirements
for
establishing
a
service
connection.
it
didn't
specifically
say,
to
make
out
an
increased
rating
claim,
you
have
to
show
that
your
hearing
has
become
worse.
but
as
soon
as
she
got
a
decision
from
the
regional
office,
which
is
the
first-line
decisionmaker
in
the
va
system,
she
was
told
that
the
reason
her
claim
had
been
denied
was
because
her
hearing
loss
was
not
sufficiently
severe
under
the
table,
and
there's
a
fairly
mechanical
application
of
a
certain
number
of
decibels
and
a
certain
--
in
each
ear
yields
a
certain
disability
rating,
and
the
notice
that
she
got
from
the
regional
office
explained
all
of
that
and
cited
the
regulation
that
reproduced
the
tables.
so
at
that
point
she
was
aware
of
why
her
claim
had
been
denied
and
what
was
missing,
namely,
evidence
that
her
hearing
had
become
worse.
and
she
had
been
given
at
that
point
a
series
of
hearing
examinations
--
examinations
for
hearing
by
the
--
by
va
doctors,
and
the
results
of
those
were
all
reproduced
in
the
decision
that
she
got.
and
yet,
the
veterans
court
found
that
the
government
had
failed
to
carry
its
burden
of
showing
a
lack
of
prejudice,
because
we
hadn't
--
we
couldn't
show
as
a
matter
of
law
that
there
was
no
way
she
could
obtain
additional
evidence.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
fair
description
of
the
effect
of
the
rule
adopted
by
the
court
below.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
in
this
case
is
a
good
illustration
about
why
that
sort
of
grave
doubt
you
are
describing
doesn't
arise
in
a
case
like
this,
where
at
no
stage
of
the
proceedings
has
the
claimant
offered
anything
that
they
would
have
done
any
differently.
if
they
can't
say,
you
know,
here's
what
would
have
happened
differently,
than
there
really
isn't
any
doubt
as
to
what
will
happen
on
remand.
if
there's
a
remand
and
they
don't
do
anything
different,
the
result
is
not
going
to
be
any
different.
and
so--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no,
that
there
--
there
certainly
--
there
was
an
error.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the
error
was
that
the
initial
letter
that
was
sent
to
her
describing
what
the
evidence
needed
to
--
that
she
needed
to
submit
in
order
to
establish
her
claim,
misidentified
that
evidence;
it
described
the
elements
of
a
general
claim
for
service
connectedness;
it
didn't
specifically
explain
what
was
needed
to
establish
an
increased
rating
claim.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the
principal
reason
why
that
error
was
not
prejudicial
is
because
the
only
way
that
she
could
have
received
benefits
for
an
increased
rating
claim
is
if
there
were
evidence
that
her
hearing
had
become
worse.
and
she
had
a
va
hearing
test
that
said
that
her
hearing
did
not
meet
the
schedule
or
criteria
for
being
a
compensable
disability.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the
--
the
fact
--
i
mean,
i
--
we
believe
that
it
should
have
been,
but
under
the
rule
as
imposed
by
the
courts
below,
it
clearly
wasn't.
under
the
decision
of
the
federal
circuit,
the
va
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
was
no
way
that
benefits
could
have
been
awarded
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
that,
in
effect,
requires
the
va
to
prove
a
negative
by
demonstrating
the
nonexistence
of
any
evidence
anywhere
that
might
have
been
material
to
the
claim.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
because
--
there
are
two
responses
to
that:
the
first
is
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
stage
of
the
proceedings
at
which
this
inquiry
was
relevant.
the
prejudicial
error
is
only
an
issue
once
the
claimant
has
reached
the
veterans
court,
which
is
an
adversarial
judicial
proceeding
where
claimants
do
have
counsel,
and
they've
identified
an
error,
and
they've
explained
to
the
court,
you
know,
here's
what
the
error
was.
so
that's
the
stage
at
which
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
them
to
articulate
how
the
error
might
have
affected
them.
and
i
think
the
other
point
to
be
made
is
that,
under
the
rule
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it's
going
to
be
very,
very
difficult
in
many
cases
for
the
government
to
discharge
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
could
possibly
have
been
produced.
and
what's
--
what
that
is
going
to
result
in
is
a
large
number
of
remands--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i'm
not
--
not
aware
that
this
court
has
ever
suggested
that
it
would
be--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes,
it
is
--
and
it's
certainly
that,
and
it
is--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no,
and
i
think
that
by
adopting
language
from
the
apa,
using
the
same
language
that
applies
to
all
kinds
of
judicial
review
of
agency
actions,
congress
strongly
suggested
that
it
didn't
want
a
unique
rule
for
judicial
review
of
va
determinations.
and
so
i
think
there's
--
there's
no
reason
to
defer
to
either
the
veterans
court
or
the
federal
circuit
on
this
general
question
of
the
standard
of
prejudicial
review--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--when
i
said
they
were
represented
by
counsel,
i
meant
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
veterans
claims,
not
at
the
administrative--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--in
the
--
in
the
administrative
proceeding,
the
restrictions
on
payment
of
counsel
have
now
been
relaxed
at
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals
stage.
so
there
generally
--
there
is
not
counsel
at
the
regional
office,
but
once
the
case
reaches
the
board,
there
can
be
counsel.
and--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
--
the
don't
know
the
statistics
on
that,
because
that
--
the
statute
is
quite
recent.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
in
any
event,
that
is
no
longer
the
case
at
the
board
level,
and
even
those
claimants
who
do
not
have
counsel,
the
great
majority
of
them,
i
think
about
three-quarters
at
the
regional
office
level
and
98
percent
at
the
board
level,
are
represented
by
some
sort
of
non-attorney
representative,
either
service
organizations
like
the
american
legion,
or
many
states
have
organizations
that
assist
claimants.
like
ms.
simmons,
for
example,
was
represented
by
a
north
carolina
state
agency
before
the
va.
so
there
is
some
assistance
to
claimants
there,
but--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--there
--
if
you're
talking
about
after
the
initial
decision
from
the
regional
office,
there
is
not
an
automatic
right
to
a
remand,
but
there
is
an
automatic
right
to
a
de
novo
review
by
a
more
senior
official
at
the
regional
office--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
you
can
get
a
hearing.
you
can
present
new
evidence
to
the
--
it's
a
decision
review
officer.
and
then
if
you
are
still
dissatisfied
with
the
resolution
after
that,
you
can
go
to
the
board,
and
you
can
get
a
hearing
before
the
board.
the
board's
review
is
de
novo.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
guess
to
the
extent
that
the
delay
in
adjudicating
the
claim
is
a
kind
of
prejudice,
it's
not
a
prejudice
that
would
in
any
sense
be
cured
by
a
remand
for
further
proceedings,
which
will
just
result
in
further
delay.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
would
just
add
that
the
--
the
effective
date
of
the
claim,
which
is
the
date
as
of
which
benefits
are
awarded,
is
the
date
that
the
claim
was
filed,
so
there
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
be
losing
money
when
you
--
except
for
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the
--
the
government
has
a
very
strong
inducement
to
follow
the
statutory
obligation.
i
mean,
like
every
agency--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
i
suppose
that's
right,
but
i
think
in
a
lot
of
cases
--
i
mean,
the
va
in
all
cases
strives
conscientiously
to
comply
with
its
statutory
obligations.
the
notice
requirements
as
described
in
section
5103
are
fairly
vague.
they
have
--
the
notice
has
to
be
tailored,
at
least
to
some
extent,
to
the
nature
of
the
claim
that's
presented.
and
every
time,
you
know,
the
veterans
court
or
the
federal
circuit
elaborates
on
exactly
what
kind
of
notice
is
required,
to
the
extent
that
the
va
wasn't
aware
of
that
elaboration
before,
there
are
going
to
have
to
be
remands
in
all
those
pending
cases.
and--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--but
it's
a
problem
that
is
particularly
acute
here,
given
the
volume
of
claims
that
the
va
has
to--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the
claim,
when
remanded
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
veterans
--
for
veterans
claims,
goes
back
to
the
board.
in
most
instances,
the
board
would
then
send
it
back
to
the
regional
office
for
further
development.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
make
just
three
points:
first,
on
the
question
of
what
is
provided
to
the
claimant
after
the
denial
in
the
regional
office.
before
they
get
to
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals,
the
regional
office
issues
them
a
statement
of
the
case,
and
that's
described
at
38
c.f.r.
19.29,
and
that
regulation
has
fairly
detailed
requirements
about
what
has
to
be
in
there
in
terms
of
a
description
of
the
evidence,
a
description
of
the
applicable
laws
and
regulations,
and
an
analysis
of
the
board's
conclusions,
or
the
regional
office's
conclusions
and
its
application
of
the
law
to
the
evidence.
the
second
point--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--in
many
cases,
it
would
be.
but
perhaps
there
would
be
some
where
it
wouldn't,
and
of
course
in
those
cases
if
there
can
be
some
articulation
of
why
it
wasn't,
then
we
would
agree
that--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no.
once
--
once
they've
filed
the
notice
of
disagreement
in
the
regional
office
and
received
the
statement
of
the
case,
they
can
then
have
a
lawyer
in
the
board--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--if
you
are
referring
to
the
statement
of
the
case,
by
the
time
they
receive
the
statement
of
the
case
they
would
be
at
a
stage
of
the
proceedings
where
they
could
get
a
lawyer.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
they--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--oh,
if
you
meant
the
original
notice
required
by
the
--
the
statute,
no.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
correct.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
yes.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
that--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
yes.
but
the
--
the
important
point
is
that
the
only
way
that
prejudicial
error
becomes
an
issue
--
and
really
the
paradigmatic
case
of
what
we're
talking
about
is
where
the
veteran
does
get
counsel
and
has
reached
the
veterans
court
and
has
identified
the
error
in
a
way
that's
persuasive
to
the
veterans
court,
but
nonetheless
identifies
no
additional
evidence
that
they
would
have
presented.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
yes,
and
a
--
and
a
claimant
who
in
the
veterans
court
can
say,
you
know,
i
didn't
understand
and
as
a
result
i
failed
to
present
the
--
because
of
the
defective
notice
and
my
lack
of
understanding
of
the
statement
of
the
case,
i
didn't
present
this
important
piece
of
evidence,
and
here's
how
it
would
have
been
material,
in
that
case,
they
would
be
entitled
to
a
remand.
but
a
remand--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--allowed
to
retain
counsel.
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
was
just
going
to
say
that,
given
the
volume
of
cases
that
the
va
confronts,
there
is
a
serious
harm
to
the
system
in
unnecessary
remands
that
have
to
be
given
priority
over
other
cases
and
that
divert
resources
from
the
adjudication
of
meritorious
claims.
