justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
as
between
the
two
courts,
the
court
of
appeals
for
veterans
claims
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit,
do
we
owe
either
of
them
--
maybe
not
deference
in
the
chevron
sense
--
but
some
deference
just
because
of
their
expertise
in
dealing
with
these
claims?
and
if
that
is
so,
do
we
owe
more
deference
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
veterans'
claims?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
mean,
would
--
it's
--
it's
an
issue
of
law,
so
i
take
it
it's
de
novo.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
--
in
the
exercise
of
that
review,
don't
we
have
to
give
some
weight
to
the
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
veterans
claims
which
sees
these
claims
all
the
time?
i
--
i
actually
thought
that
that's
where
you
were
going
to
start
out
because
you
cited
7261,
which
says
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
claims
shall,
what,
give
due
effect
to
--
take
due
account
of
the
rule
of
prejudicial
error.
and
i
think
you
could
get
from
that
that
they
have
a
certain
amount
of
latitude
in
determining
what
the
best
rule
is.
but
you're
not
going
to
--
you
don't
tell
us
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
case,
did
the
--
your
client
attend
the
initial
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what's
the
first
time
that
your
client
knew
that
this
claim
was
going
to
be
processed
at
a
particular
time
or
the
first
time
your
client
knew
it
had
been
denied?
i
just
was
never
clear
on
the
facts
of
what
happened
here.
the
notice
was
lost
in
the
mail.
so
how
did
she
know
there
was
a
hearing
at
all,
or
did
she?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
just
trying
to
--
it
seems
to
me,
at
the
first
hearing,
if
she
in
fact
is
there,
they
say,
well,
now
you
have
to
give
us
some
notice.
and
then
at
that
point
--
or
some
documentation
--
and
at
that
point,
at
the
initial
hearing,
everybody
knows
who
has
to
produce
what.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
usually
an
initial
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
--
the
statute
says
--
and
this
is
consistent
with
justice
breyer's
line
of
questioning
--
that
the
veterans
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
veterans
court
of
appeals,
shall
give
due
account
to
the
notice
--
to
the
rule
of
prejudicial
error.
that
seems
to
me
to
indicate
that
it
has
some
discretion
in
how
to
decide
the
harmless
error
rules
that
it
will
apply,
and
that
it
knows
more
about
it,
in
justice
breyer's
terms,
than
either
we
or
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
why
can't
i
get
that
out
of
this
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
just
tells
that
--
that
the
secretary
requests
the
claimant
provide
any
evidence
in
the
claimant's
possession
that
pertains
to
the
claim.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
fairly
straightforward.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
about
the
notice,
the
original
notice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
don't
have
a
lawyer
at
that
point?
that
was
justice
souter's
question.
i
didn't
--
i--
