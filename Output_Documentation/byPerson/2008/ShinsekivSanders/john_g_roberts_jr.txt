chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
07-1209,
peake
v.
sanders
et
al.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
basically
have
four
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
to
support
that
proposition,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
this
is
--
i
mean,
it's
kind
of
the
--
it's
the
first
notice.
it
gets
the
ball
rolling.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
like
you
have
two
teams
and
you
don't
tell
one
of
the
teams
when
the
game
starts,
and
then
you
say,
well,
it
doesn't
matter
because
they
would
have
lost
anyway,
there's
no
prejudice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
usually,
when
you
have
an
appellate
court
--
you
know,
it's
a
hard
question,
they're
easily
divided,
the
case
is
resolved
on
the
basis
of
the
standard
of
review.
what
is
the
presumption,
if
it's
a
close
case?
and
why
isn't
that
all
sort
of
what
we
are
talking
about
here?
it's
a
close
case,
and
the
judge
--
the
panel
says,
well,
this
side
has
the
burden
of
persuasion,
so
we're
going
to
come
out
the
other
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
if
what
they
would
have
done
differently
is
get
a
different
medical
test,
or
done
something
like
that,
or
had
the
doctor
in
the
prior
testing
who
prepared
the
diagnosis
look
at
something
that
they
didn't
have
them
look
at
before?
in
other
words,
it's
not
simply
the
absence
of
documents
that
they
know
they
can
submit
or
could
have
submitted.
it's
that
type
of
question.
and
nobody
knows.
i
mean,
you
don't
know
what
would
have
happened
if
they
had
the
doctor
look
at
this
issue
that
now
turns
out
to
be
critical,
but
if
they
had
gotten
the
right
notice
they
might
have
had
time
to
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
know,
it's
easy
--
it's
easy
to
look
back
and
view
this
in
sort
of
abstract
legal
terms,
but
we
are
dealing
with
lay
people
who
are
trying
to
get
something
from
the
government,
which
is
always
a
difficult
thing.
and
they
get
one
notice
saying
you
have
got
to
show
that
this
was
during
the
service.
then
they
get
another
notice
or
decision
saying
it
wasn't
severe
enough.
why
is
it
so
difficult,
when
the
government
made
a
mistake
in
dealing
with
this
layperson
who
is
just
trying
to
get
benefits
to
which
they
are
entitled,
to
say
that
the
government
has
to
show
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference,
rather
than
requiring
the
--
the
layperson
to
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
mr.
meade.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no
court
is
going
to
accept
as
a
showing
of
prejudice
the
idea
that,
here,
look
at
my
client,
you
know,
as
a
layperson
didn't
know
what
to
do.
that's
not
going
to
be
adequate,
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
wrong
with
mr.
miller's
response
that,
at
the
very
first
level
of
review,
you
can
start
all
over;
at
that
point
you
know
precisely
why
your
claim
was
denied?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
was
my
question.
is
it
--
is
it
--
i
take
it
it's
more
than
just
a
stamp
saying
"denied",
right?
there's
some
explanation
in
every
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
meade.
mr.
lippman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
started
earlier,
at
one
point,
to
say
how
this
actually
worked
out
in
your
case.
could
you
just
spend
a
minute
to
explain
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
it
makes
a
difference
in
your
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
wasn't
that
enough
for
you
to
establish
prejudice,
regardless
of
who
had
the
burden?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
uh-hmm.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
would
phrase
the
prejudice
in
terms
of
what
you
would
have
done
but
you
weren't
able
to
do
and
what
you
can
now
go
back
and
do
if
it's
remanded.
you
don't
have
to
have
the
evidence
that
three
people
would
say
he
was
complaining
about
the
vision
loss
at
the
time.
it
just
seems
a
reasonable
thing
to
--
you
know,
maybe
it
is
reasonable,
maybe
it's
not;
but
the
veterans
administration
has
more
knowledge
about
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
miller,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
it's
perfectly
clear
from
that
what
gaps
need
to
be
filled
in?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
have
been
saying
"entitled
to
a
lawyer",
do
you
mean
entitled
to
a
lawyer
or
allowed
to
have
a
lawyer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
