justice
john
paul
stevens
when
was
congress
aware
of
this,
when
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
passed,
you
mean?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i'm
not
following
as
well
as
i
should,
but
it
seemed
to
me
you
are
suggesting
there
was
no
error
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
was
the
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
that
that
error
was
not
prejudicial
because
the
earlier
information
she
had
received
gave
her
everything
she
needed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
that's
the
case,
why
wasn't
that
statement
you
just
made
sufficient
to
discharge
your
burden
of
showing
no
prejudice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
factual
question?
you
said
most
of
these
people
were
represented
by
counsel.
there
used
to
be
a
rule
that
they
could
only
be
paid
$10
a
case.
is
that
still
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
but
not
during
the
nisi
prius
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
can
be
counsel,
but
is
it
really
typical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
a
dramatic
change,
because
years
ago,
i
remember
a
case
in
which
the
court
upheld
a
$10
fee
limit
on
the
notion
that
these
people
didn't
need
lawyers
at
all,
which
struck
me
as
a
little
strange.
