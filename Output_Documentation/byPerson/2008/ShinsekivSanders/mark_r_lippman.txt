mr.
mark
r.
lippman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
breyer,
i'd
like
to
address
one
of
the
observations
you
made
applying
o'neal
and
kotteakos
and
the
"grave
doubt"
standard.
the
problem
here
is
that
those
standards
assume
a
fully
developed
record.
and
that's
why
it's
not
a
perfect
fit
here
because
the
very
notice
--
or
failure
or
defective
notice
prevents
a
fully
developed
record.
so--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--i
don't
believe
you
should,
and
if
my
case
could
be
used
as
an
example--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--correct.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
that's
correct.
he
did
not
get
the
second
and
third-element
notices;
that
is,
what
the
government
said
it
will
get
and
what
he
was
required
to
get.
this
is
the
letter
or
part
of
the
letter,
critical
part
of
the
letter
he
got.
it
said:
"we
are
making
reasonable
efforts
to
help
you
get
private
records
or
evidence
necessary
to
support
your
claim.
"
so
he
had
every
reason
to
assume
that
the
--
that
the
va
would
get
the
evidence
that
was
necessary,
which
is
the
second
and
third--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--well,
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor:
the
first
is
the
government
makes
a
proposition
that
all
we
need
to
do
is
offer
an
explanation.
but
in
legal
terms,
that's
a
proffer
on
appeal,
and
that
is
every
bit
as
evidential
as
the
actual
evidence
itself.
now,
if
we
--
if
we
are
to
have
a
whole
practice
of
proffers,
it
opens
up
a
pandora's
box.
i
mean,
where
--
where
do
you
stop
if
you
make
an
exception
for
extra-record
evidence,
when
the
statutes
make
it
clear
that
the
evidence
or
whatever
you
are
using
has
to
be
before
the
agency.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
the
statutes
stop
you
from
doing
that.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
yes,
but
in
all
due
respect,
i
think
the
veterans
court
got
it
wrong.
i
mean,
the
veterans
--
if
you
look
at
the
line
of
authority
of--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--okay.
let's
look
at
it
this
way.
let's
take
it
outside
the
vcaa
context.
a
veteran
has
a
right
to
a
hearing,
an
evidentiary
hearing,
upon
request.
let's
say
he
requests
the
hearing,
and
for
whatever
reason
the
va
doesn't
schedule
one.
he
loses
that
right
even
though
he
requests
it.
are
we
then
now
to
have
proffers
on
the
court
of
appeals
saying,
well,
i
would
have
said
this,
i
would
have
said
this,
i
would
have
said--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--well,
there's
--
there's
really
no
analysis
to
it.
i
mean,
it's
sort
of
an
intuitive
distinction,
and
in
my
case,
it
doesn't
work.
and
i
think--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--well,
i
guess
you
would
have
to
reconcile
the
more
specific
statute
that
--
that
deals
with
only
being
able
to
submit
evidence
or
any
other
material
at
the
time
--
at
the
time
of
the
agency
adjudication.
in
other
words,
i
don't
see
that
statute
allowing
post-agency
adjudication
proffers
or
even
submitting
evidence.
i
mean,
just
by
the
very
line
of
your
questioning,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
find
it
interchangeable,
whether
you
assert
it
in
--
in
your
brief
that
this
is
what
i
would
have
gotten
or
whether
you
would
have
submitted
the
evidence
itself.
they
are
both
evidential.
and
another
problem,
which
is
really--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--no,
your
honor.
the
--
the
--
what
the
government
must
show
is
--
is
well
set
forth
in
the
federal
circuit's
opinion.
it
must
show
that
the
claimant
had
either
actual
knowledge
of
what
he
needed
to
submit;
second,
the
fact
that
he
had
sort
of
constructive
knowledge,
in
other
words
a
reasonable
claimant
would
have
had
notice;
or,
three,
that
the
claim
couldn't
be
entitled
to
benefits
as
a
matter
of
law.
so
that's
the
beauty--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--well--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--he
wouldn't
get
the
money,
okay,
because
all
--
we
are
talking
about
a
remand,
not
an--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--correct.
correct,
but
why
shouldn't--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--well,
let
me
answer
it
this
way:
let's
assume
we
do
make
proffers,
as
you
suggest,
at
the
veterans--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--well,
in
a
legal
sense
i
consider
it
the
same
thing.
maybe
your
honors
don't,
but
i
do.
and
--
let
--
let's
say
he
proffers
or
describes
in
his
brief,
you
know,
what
medical
evidence
he
needs
to
submit.
now,
how
could
he
in
good
faith
make
a
--
make
a
proffer
and
speculate
on
what
the
doctor
--
let's
say
he
is
seeing
a
treating
doctor.
and
on
page
49
in
the
footnote,
there's
a
discussion
of
what
i'm
going
to
explain
to
you
now.
but
let's
say
he
alleges,
well,
if
i
had
gotten
notice,
i
would
have
gone
to
my
treating
doctor,
and
i
would
have
submitted
questions
and
i
would
have
submitted
the
claims
file,
but
i
can't
know
in
good
faith
what
the
doctor
would
say.
it's
inherently
speculative.
and
that's
one
good
policy
reason,
apart
from
the
clear
categorical
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
how--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--sure.
it
was
a
little
unclear
until
a
case
--
if
i
may
answer
it
this
way,
your
honor.
my
--
the
board
of
veterans'
appeals
decided
there
was
only
one
medical
evidence
it
would
follow,
and
that
was
a
2000
va
exam.
and
that
exam
really
denied
the
veteran
because
there
was
no
corroborating
medical
evidence
contemporary
with
his
injury
and
the
symptomology
thereafter.
if
i
could
have
it
go
back
down,
what
i
would
do
is
try
to
find
what
we
call
"buddy
statements",
lay
statements,
that
would
corroborate
that
he
had
symptoms
from
the
time
of
service
and
well
on,
which
would
--
which
under
a
case
called
buchanan
is
sufficient
evidence
to
base
a
finding
of
service
connection.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
to
make
that
allegation
on
--
at
the
court
of
appeal
that
i
would
have
gotten
this?
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
quite
frankly,
i
don't
know
if
i
would
have
gotten
it.
i
mean,
i
would
try.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
your
honor,
in
a
way,
the
--
the
third
prong
of
the
federal
circuit's
analysis
does
that.
it
tells
the
government:
look,
if
the
veteran
could
--
could
not
prove
his
claim,
no
matter
what
the
facts
--
evidentiary
development
was,
then
the
veteran
loses.
so
really
it's
all
contained
in
the
third
prong.
and
that's
why
the
federal
circuit's
analysis
in
my
opinion
is
so
good.
it's
because
it
doesn't
make
you
go
outside
of
the
record
to
reach
these
issues,
and
it
allows
the
government
a
lot
of
room
to
prove
that
it's
not
worthwhile,
this
claim's
not
worthwhile,
to
remand.
i
ask
the
court
to
really
carefully
look
at
that
because
i
know
the
federal
circuit
spent
--
must
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
coming
up
with
that
analysis.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
well--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--well,
they
haven't
enumerated
it,
your
honor,
as
such,
but
analytically
it
breaks
down
to
that.
but
the
fourth
element
--
because
it
says:
look,
you'll
have
to
tell
the
claimant
what
the
contents,
you
know,
what
you
need.
then
it
says:
well,
what
we
are
going
to
get
for
you,
and
then
that's
the
second.
and
third
one
is
what
you
have
to
get.
the
fourth
one
was
engrafted
upon
it
because
in
the
--
in
the
regs
--
3.159
has
a
more
generalized
advisement
in
addition
to
this--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
no,
it's
in
3.159.
i
don't
recall
the
exact
--
it's
38
c.f.r.
3.159.
i
don't
recall
offhand
the
exact
subdivision,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
correct.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
it's
not
as
important
as
--
as
the
first,
second,
and
third
elements
of
the
statute,
for
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
thank
you.
