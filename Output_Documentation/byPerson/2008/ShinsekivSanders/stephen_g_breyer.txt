justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
in
o'neal.
it
says
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
most
of
the
court
joined,
and
the
reason
that
it
says
it
is
because
it
just
confuses
everybody,
at
least
me,
to
talk
about
"burden"
in
this
context.
i
think
if
o'neal
is
right,
it
says
what
this
is,
is
not
involving
a
jury,
not
involving
--
it's
just
what
justice
alito
says,
and
following
that
through,
what
you'd
--
you
say
to
the
judge:
judge,
your
job
is
to
decide
this.
decide.
decide
whether
you
think
that
the
one
side
--
whether
there
is
error
or
whether
the
error
is
harmless
or
whether
it
isn't.
decide
it.
now,
it
could
be
in
a
rare
instance
the
judge
just
can't
decide.
he's
in
grave
doubt.
and
so
what
we
are
talking
about
is
what
to
do
in
that
--
what
should
be
a
very,
very
rare
instance.
now,
when
i
read
this
case,
i
thought
that
the
veterans
affairs
is
absolutely
common
sense
on
this.
it
says:
when
you
really
don't
know
what
to
do,
judge,
if
the
veteran
got
no
notice
at
all,
then
probably
the
error
was
harmful.
but
if
he
got
the
basic
notice,
and
all
that's
at
issue
is
who
should
produce
what
or
whether
he
thinks
that
he
didn't
know
that
he's
supposed
to
produce
a
lot
of
information,
well,
there,
you
know,
it
would
be
pretty
rare
that
it
was
harmful.
and
so
you'd
better
say
to
him:
veteran,
why
did
this
hurt
you?
that's
all
common
sense,
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
that's
what
the
veterans
court
was
saying,
and
then
the
federal
circuit
unfortunately,
like
i
might
have
done,
too,
got
it
all
mixed
up
with
this
burden
of
proof
language.
now,
you
tell
me,
legally,
is
that
result
which
i
am
talking
about
sensible,
and
if
so,
how
do
i
get
there
legally?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
criticizing
you
for
that.
i'm
not
--
it's
not
a
criticism.
i'm
just
really
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
get
to
what
i
see
as
common
sense
legally.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
theory
is
he
didn't
know
anything
about
this,
got
no
notice
whatsoever,
so
he
didn't
know
that
he's
supposed
to
produce
some
more
information
or
he'll
lose.
that's
the
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
connect
it
by
saying
normally
a
veteran
who
isn't
that
knowledgeable
--
not
everybody
is
a
genius
in
law
--
when
he
doesn't
get
a
notice
that
tells
him
you
got
to
produce
something
more
or
you
lose,
he
might
forget
to
produce
something
more.
that's
the
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
so
fine.
if
i
get
that
record
and
if
it
is
the
way
you
describe,
i'm
not
in
grave
doubt.
no
problem.
if
the
record's
the
way
you
describe
it,
she
knew
everything
she
was
supposed
to
know,
so
there's
no
harmful
error,
okay?
we
are
only
talking
about
cases
where
there
is
real
doubt
in
the
judge's
mind
about
whether
this
failure
of
the
agency
did
or
did
not
hurt
the
woman
or
man.
now,
when
in
doubt,
we
have
the
veterans
court
telling
us
the
best
way
to
administer
this
stuff
is
when
they
get
no
notice
at
all,
and
you
are
really
in
doubt,
judge,
you
don't
know
if
it
was
harmful
or
not,
here's
what
you
do:
assume
it
was
harmful.
they're
the
ones
who
know.
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
suppose
then
we
look
at
o'neal,
we
read
the
first
paragraph.
it
was
what
this
court
said,
and
we
all
held
it
and,
therefore,
we
say,
those
are
the
cases
we're
talking
about
where
you're
in
doubt,
and
when
you're
in
doubt,
go
proceed
as
the
veterans
court
told
you
in
terms
of
who
has
to
show
what.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so,
why
not
just
say
that?
what's
the
big
problem
of
saying,
judge
--
and
then
you
say
just
what
you
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
judge
again
won't
be
in
doubt
anymore.
so
there's
no
need
for
this
case
because,
either
--
either
--
either
the
veteran's
agency
will
say:
look,
i
walked
that
veteran
through
the
process,
i
walked
him
through
the
process;
walking
him
through
the
process,
he
was
told
everything
he
needed
to
know,
and
there's
no
real
problem
here.
it's
just
a
formality
that
he
didn't
get
the
notice.
and
if
that's
true,
i'm
not
in
any
doubt,
unless
the
veteran
tells
me
that
that's
wrong,
and
here
was
something,
okay?
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
your
case.
in
your
case,
she
didn't
go
to
the
doctor.
if
she
went
to
the
doctor,
maybe
she
would
have
found
something
out.
again,
i
have
no
doubt,
there's
harmful
error.
so
this
case
is
a
theoretical
law
professor's
case
that's
never
going
to
come
up,
because
there's
never
any
doubt.
either
the
va
did
walk
him
through
it
and
there's
no
deal
--
big
deal,
because
she
can't
come
up
with
anything,
or
she
can
come
up
with
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
certainly
does
because
it
makes
sense
to
tell
the
government:
government,
you
have
to
come
up
with
every
possible,
conceivable
factual
scenario
and
prove
there
wasn't
a
man
from
mars
who
came
in,
and
--
you
know,
that
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
all
this,
and
why
don't
you
just
tell
the
judge
that
and
say:
look
at
my
client,
judge,
look
at
my
client.
my
client
obviously
isn't
going
to
understand
what
to
do
unless
the
client
is
told.
and
here
my
client
wasn't
told.
i'm
the
judge,
i'm
not
in
any
doubt,
you're
going
to
win,
okay?
so
what
i
can't
figure
out
is
how
to
deal
with
this
case,
which,
as
i
said,
strikes
me
as
a
law
professor's
case
that
shouldn't
make
any
difference
in
any
real
situation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
--
what
i
was
trying
to
get
to,
which
i
don't
see
how
to
quite
get
there
--
it
seems
to
me
that
if
something
really
went
wrong,
if
there's
--
there's
no
notice,
that,
veteran,
you
have
to
put
in
some
material,
or
you
are
going
to
lose,
if
there's
no
notice
of
that,
and
he
really
didn't
get
any
notice
during
all
this
cooperative
process,
then
i
think
the
veterans
court
is
right.
at
that
point,
i
think
it's
fair
to
assume
that
he's
hurt.
but
if
he
got
the
notice
--
i
mean,
there
will
be
a
few
cases
where
he
had
nothing
to
produce,
but
a
lot
of
them
he
would
have
had
something
to
produce.
so
that's
--
they
know
it.
we
don't
know.
the
veterans
court
knows.
now,
the
other
three
matters
--
who
is
supposed
to
produce
what,
and
do
you
have
general
knowledge,
you
could
produce
whatever
you
want
--
i
would
think
it
would
be
very
rare
that
a
veteran
was
hurt,
if
he
knows
the
first,
by
not
knowing
the
second,
third,
and
fourth.
and,
therefore,
i'd
think
he
better
come
forth
to
explain
in
the
brief,
in
the
brief,
why
this
mattered.
now,
that's
what
it
seemed
to
me
the
veterans
court
set
up.
they
know
about
it.
they
set
that
up.
it's
common
sense.
so,
how
do
i
get
to
a
legal
result
that
says
just
that?
or
can
i
or
should
i?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
that
such
a
tough
thing
to
do?
it
sounds
like
it's
sort
of
--
is
there
some
law
out
there
that
stops
you
from
saying
in
the
brief,
in
a
paragraph:
we
would
just
like
you
to
know,
judge,
that
we
had
some
evidence
here.
or
we
have
some
now
that
we
want
to
present
to
them.
that's
all.
and
then
if
i
see
that,
i'd
say,
my
goodness.
and
you
describe
it
in
three
sentences.
now,
what
is
--
the
constitution
doesn't
stop
you
from
doing
that,
does
it?
i
mean,
what
stops
you
from
doing
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
stop
you?
but
the
veterans
court
said
to
do
it.
so
they're
--
they're
the
ones
who
know
this
area
and
they
said
you
should
have
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
between
me
and
the
veterans
court,
as
to
who
knows
best
how
to
work
this
system,
it's
10
to
1,
and
it's
not
me.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they've
decided
there
is
if
there's
no
notice
at
all,
no,
you
don't
have
to
have
a
proffer,
because
it's
up
to
the
agency
to
do
just
what
you
want.
but
if
it's
one
of
these
other
three
far
more
technical
things,
which
occur
far
more
rarely,
on
that
one,
you
better
tell
the
judge
in
the
brief
how
it
makes
a
difference.
that's
their
conclusion.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i
don't
understand
that.
you
mean
--
let's
suppose,
contrary
to
your
wishes,
that
the
client
was
not
hurt.
he
was
hurt
by
some
other
thing,
nothing
to
do
with
the
bazooka.
that's
not
your
client
--
that's
the
imaginary
client.
but
everything
else
is
the
same.
well,
does
that
mean
because
they
forgot
to
tell
the
client
that
the
client
has
to
go
and
produce
some
evidence,
and
she
thought
the
veterans
administration
would
produce
all
the
evidence?
because
they
forgot
that,
your
client
wins
and
gets
the
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that
doesn't
seem--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know.
now
you're
going
to
be
back
in
the
remand,
and
you
now
have
to
produce
some
evidence,
don't
you,
or
you
lose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
why
is
it
a
big
deal
that
you
summarize
what
you're
going
to
produce
in
the
brief?
we're
back
where
we
started.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
want
to
call
them
"a
proffer".
i
just
want
to
say
a
description
in
the
brief
of
how
you're
hurt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
second
case
called
shinseki
versus
sanders
involves
harmless
errors,
notice
errors
and
veterans
benefit.
now
when
a
veteran
applies
to
the
department
of
foreign
affairs
for
benefits,
the
veterans
administration
has
to
help
that
veteran
prepare
the
claim
for
benefits.
and
in
doing
that,
the
veterans
administration
has
to
send
the
veteran
some
notices,
various
notices.
some
tell
the
veteran
for
example
“what
information
is
missing?”
“what
additional
information
has
to
be
provided”,
and
“who
is
going
to
provide
what?”
“which
information
the
veterans
administration
will
provide
and
which
the
veteran
has
to
provide?”
the
law
also
says
a
veterans
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
federal
circuit
when
they
review
a
veteran's
benefit
decision
granting
or
denying
the
benefit,
they
have
to
take
due
account
of
the
rule
of
prejudicial
error.
and
that
means
they
have
to
apply
ordinary
rules
of
harmless
error.
now,
we
here
consider
two
cases.
in
one
of
those
cases,
a
veterans
court
found
that
a
notice
error
of
failure
to
give
the
right
notice
was
harmless.
and
in
the
other
case,
it
found
that
the
notice
error
was
harmful.
the
federal
circuit
reversed
the
first
decision
and
in
doing
that,
it
laid
down
a
set
of
harmless-error
rules.
and
in
essence,
those
rules
would
find
every
such
error
harmful.
unless
the
va
shows
the
veteran
already
knew
the
information
or
it
just
couldn't
have
been
entitled
to
the
benefit
under
the
law.
well,
our
job
is
in
this
case
is
to
ask
whether
the
rules
that
the
federal
circuit
laid
down,
if
you're
still
following
this,
we
have
to
ask
whether
the
rules
that
the
federal
circuit
laid
down
are
consistent
with
the
law's
ordinary
civil
case
harmless-error
rules.
our
answer
is
no.
they're
not
consistent.
they
are
too
complicated.
they
are
too
rigid.
they
are
too
likely
to
make
a
lower
court
like
the
veterans
court
reach
a
long
conclusion
namely
find
an
error
it
was
harmful
when
it
really
isn't
harmful
after
you
read
the
record.
that
becomes
obvious.
so,
that's
our
final
holding.
and
then
we
review
the
records
in
the
individual
cases,
and
in
one
case,
we
reverse
the
federal
circuit.
and
then
in
the
other,
we
vacate
its
decision
and
remand
the
case
and
we
explained
all
this
much
more
fully
in
the
opinion.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
and
justice
ginsburg
joined.
