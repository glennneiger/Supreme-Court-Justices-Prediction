justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
can
we
go
back
to
the
question
that
was
first
posed?
we
have
never
held
that
every
agency
--
you
know,
agencies
come
in
many
sizes
and
shapes
--
that
in
all
cases,
the
apa
places
the
burden
on
the
appellant
or
the
petitioner.
but
this
court
has
never
held
that
across
the
board,
no
matter
what
agency
we
are
talking
about,
that's
the
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
government
has
the
obligation
at
the
very
first
to
tell
the
veteran
what
the
veteran
must
produce
to
substantiate
the
claim
and
the
government
doesn't
do
that,
why
shouldn't
it
be
the
responsibility
of
the
government
to
say
to
the
court:
this
is
what
--
if
we
had
done
what
we
were
supposed
to
do,
this
is
what
we
would
have
included
in
our
notice.
and
looking
at
that,
the
court
can
tell
whether
there's
anything
the
veteran
might
have
done.
but
why
shouldn't
the
government
at
least
have
the
obligation
to
say
what
it
would
have
done
had
it
complied
with
the
statute,
what
it
would
have
said
specifically
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
experience?
when
--
when
a
case
is
remanded,
it
goes
back
to
the
--
does
it
go
back
to
the
regional?
suppose
the
--
the
veteran
is
now
given
an
opportunity
to
present
whatever
additional
substantiation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
--
notice
can
be
given
--
skipped
entirely,
as
it
was
in
simmons'
case,
or
notice
could
be
given
but
it's
defective.
it
can
be
defective
in
a
major
way.
it
can
leave
out
--
you
said
congress
recently
required
a
more
detailed
notice.
do
we
treat
all
those
like
--
as
long
as
the
notice
doesn't
measure
up
fully
to
the
statutory
requirement,
then
the
veteran
goes
back
to
square
one?
and
so,
you
wouldn't
make
any
distinction
between
whether
the
notice
was
not
given
at
all,
and
the
case
where
the
notice
was
given,
but
it
was
incomplete?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
case
is
one
where
the
veteran
did
get
what
they
call
the
first-level
notice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
justice
--
the
implication
of
justice
breyer's
question
is
that
your
client
would
lose
because
your
client
did
get
the
first-level
notice.
and
you
say,
but
that's
not
good
enough.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
where
this
first
level,
second
level
--
i'm
looking
at
the
statute
on
page
98a
of
the
petition.
and
it
seems
to
me
all
part
of
one
--
it
is
one
notice.
it
doesn't
seem
to
specify
a
second
and
a
third.
it's
describing
the
contents.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
"as
part
of
that
notice,
the
secretary
shall
indicate
which
portion
of
the
information
and
evidence
is
to
be
provided
by
the
claimant
and
which
portion
by
the
secretary.
"
the
statute
seems
to
be
talking
about
one
notice,
not
"first
level",
"second
level".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
was
taken
out,
the
fourth
one.
no?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
tell
me
what
that
is.
that's
not
in
the
statute?
