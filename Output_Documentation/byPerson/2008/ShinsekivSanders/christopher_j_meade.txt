mr.
christopher
j.
meade
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
make
three
points:
first,
because
notice
is
integral
to
the
system
that
congress
designed,
the
va's
failure
to
provide
notice
is
likely
to
prejudice
the
veteran.
second,
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
veteran
and
comparatively
easy
for
the
government
to
carry
a
burden.
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
veteran
because
under
the
government's
rule
the
veteran
would
need
to
engage
in
a
speculative
exercise,
identifying
what
evidence
would
have
been
developed
had
the
veteran
been
notified
and
had
he
received
the
full
assistance
of
the
agency.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
two
reasons,
justice
alito:
first,
it's
not
clear
even
in
the
veterans
court
that
the
veteran
will
have
notice
of
what's
required,
a
point
i
would
like
to
address.
but,
second,
if
it's
remanded,
the
process
will
develop
as
it
should
have
in
the
first
place,
because
under
the
statutory
scheme
there
is
both
the
va
and
the
veteran,
the
informed
veteran,
who
have
joint
duties,
and
together
during
an
interactive
process
they
develop
the
evidence
together.
and
during
this
interactive
process,
to
answer
justice
stevens's
question,
the
veteran
is
prohibited
from
hiring
a
lawyer.
without
having
the
most
basic
notice
of
what's
required,
the
veteran
cannot
participate
in
this
process.
and
the
only
way
we
can
know
how
the
process
would
really
work
would
be
to
give
the
veteran
the
notice
that
he
is
entitled
to
in
the
first
place
and
then
allow
the
process
to
unfold
as
it
should
have.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
the
answer
is,
first
of
all,
that
we
don't
know
how
the
process
would
unfold
once
the
veteran
has
notice.
even
if
there's
evidence
in
the
record,
we
don't
know
what
evidence
would
have
been
developed
had
the
veteran
had
proper
notice.
in
addition,
veterans
often
are
not--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well,
for
a
few
reasons.
first
of
all--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--first
of
all,
it's
unclear
whether
the
veteran
would
even
have
notice
even
at
that
point.
none
of
the
other
requirements
that
the
agency
is
required
to
give
are
the
same
as
the
notice
requirement.
however,
if
in
appropriate
cases
they
have
given
the
actual
notice
by
the
time
it
reaches
the
veterans
court,
they
can
use
that
to
rebut
the
prejudice.
and
that's
what
the
veterans
court
said
in
vazquez-flores.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
there
was
a
medical
examination
that
she
didn't
attend.
there
was
a
question
of
where
the
notice
was
sent,
and
this
is
at
70a
of
the
petition's
appendix.
there
was
confusion.
apparently,
notices
were
sent
to
the
wrong
address
by
the
agency.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
she
was
--
she
later
informed
the
agency
that
she
had
changed
her
address.
but
even
it
appears
that
further
notices
were
sent
to
the
wrong
address.
for--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well,
there's
not
necessarily
a
hearing.
there
was
a
medical
examination
that
was
supposed
to
be
scheduled
that
she
didn't
attend,
partly
because
of
confusion
of
where
the
notice
was
sent.
the
hearing--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--no.
there's
only
a
hearing
if
the
veteran
requests
it.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
so
there's
no
hearing
unless
the
veteran
requests
it.
so
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
veteran
did
not
know
what
she
needed
to
provide.
she
has
two
sets
of
claims,
one
for
her
left
ear,
one
for
her
right
ear.
neither
claim
was
intuitive,
and
she
couldn't
figure
out
what
she
needed
to
do
without
he
notice--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--well--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--i
agree
that
burdens
only
matter
in
a
handful
of
cases,
but
it
makes
sense
to
put
the
burden
on
the
government
for
a
number
of
reasons.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
but
that's
not
what
we
ask
for
here.
first
of
all,
if
the
--
the
veteran
actually
received
notice
during
this
dialogue
that
the
government
describes,
then
the
government
can
point
to
that
as
a
way
to
disprove
prejudice.
second
of
all,
veterans
are
often
vulnerable.
they
are
often
unrepresented
in
the
veterans
court.
under
the
latest
statistics,
64
percent
are
unrepresented
at
the
beginning
of
the
veterans
court,
24
percent
at
the
conclusion
of
the
veterans
court.
many
have
psychological
and
mental
disabilities
like
post-traumatic
stress
disorder.
twelve
percent
of
those
who
currently
receive
disabilities
receive
benefits
for
ptsd.
and
it's
not
clear
--
this
is
not
lawyers;
this
is
not
doctors
trying
to
receive
benefits.
this
is
not
just
lay
people.
they
are
veterans
who
served
the
country--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--the
reason
is
that
it's
helpful
to
have
presumptions
to
deal
with
the
typical
case
where
we
have
in
our
case
a
first
element
notice
error,
a
question
where
the
veteran
does
not
even
know
what
evidence
he
needs
to
put
forward.
that
--
in
that
case,
it
makes
sense,
because
of
the
high
likelihood
of
prejudice,
to
have
a
general
rule
that
the
burden
should
be
on
the
government
and
not
on
the
veteran.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
i
don't
think
it
would
be,
and
that's
why
it
makes
sense
to
have
a
general
presumption.
in
cases
where
the
government
can
either
show
that
the
process
worked
as
it
should
have
or
that
the
veteran
actually
received
notice
during
the
process,
it
can
rebut
that
prejudice.
in
fact,
in
2008
alone,
the
government
has
been
able
to
do
so.
and
it
has
done
so
at
least
a
dozen
times
in
a
number
of
cases,
rebutting
the
burden
of
prejudice
that
was
established
by
the
veterans
court.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
well,
again,
there
are
various
levels
of
review,
but
the
notice
to
start
that
first
level
of
appellate
review
does
not
necessarily
give
the
veteran
the
notice
that
she
is
entitled
to.
it--
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
--exactly.
there
is
a
statutory
requirement
that
a
statement
of
reasons
need
to
be
provided,
but
the
statement
of
reasons
don't
necessarily
correlate
with
the
detailed
requirements
under
the
notice
statute.
under
vazquez-flores,
what
the
veterans
court
said
was
that
the
notice
needs
to
be
quite
detailed
and
the
denial
letter
in
a
particular
case
might
not
map
onto
those
particular
requirements.
in
october
of
this
year,
congress
went
farther
and
said:
we
want
these
notice
letters
to
be
even
more
detailed.
we
want
to
give
the
veterans
more
notice,
which
shows
that
congress
is
concerned
about
these
notice
--
these
notice
letters
and
wants
to
make
it
clear
to
the
veteran
what
is
required.
i
want
to
answer
a
point
that
justice
alito
raised
before.
we
are
not
asking
here
for
a
presumption
of
benefits.
all
we
are
asking
for
is
a
remand
so
that
the
veteran
can
get
notice
and
have
the
process
proceed
as
it
was
meant
to
in
the
original
circumstance.
mr.
christopher
j.
meade
the
question
of
whether
the
notice
is
okay
or
not,
is
a
question
for
the
veterans
court,
a
factual
finding.
generally,
though,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
either
no
notice
or
incomplete
notice
are
the
same
and
would
trigger
a
first
notice
error.
there
would
be
cases,
i
suspect,
where
the
notice
was
erroneous,
but
only
on
a
technical
ground,
that
the
veterans
court
would
not
think
of
as
being
a
first-level
notice
error.
one
final
point
i
would
like
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that
in
passing
the
statute,
congress
made
it
clear
that
it
wanted
to
assist
all
veterans,
including
those
whose
claims
did
not
appear
meritorious
on
their
face,
and
it
did
so
by
overruling
the
decision
of
morton
v.
west
from
the
veterans
court.
that
case
had
said
that
a
veteran
needs
to
meet
a
certain
minimal
threshold
before
receiving
the
va's
assistance,
that
first
the
veteran
needs
to
show
that
the
claim
is
well
grounded.
congress
rejected
that
in
passing
the
statute
and
said:
congress
wants
to
help
all
veterans,
including
those
whose
claims
don't
seem
meritorious
on
their
face
and
including
those
who
can't
make
a
threshold
requirement.
and
congress
specifically
rejected
the
policy
rationale
of
the
veterans
court
and
said
that
they
want
--
congress
wants
to
use
resources
to
help
all
veterans,
including
those
whose
claims
are
not
meritorious
on
its
face.
thank
you,
your
honor.
