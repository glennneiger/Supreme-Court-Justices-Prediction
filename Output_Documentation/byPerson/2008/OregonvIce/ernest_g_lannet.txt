mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
yet
another
application
of
the
bright-line
rule
from
apprendi.
oregon
law
entitles
a
criminal
defendant
to
a
concurrent
sentence
for
each
offense
unless
certain
facts
are
found.
here
for
three
offenses
a
judge
found
those
facts
and
imposed
a
greater
penalty
of
a
consecutive
sentence.
that
violated
defendant's
--
or
the
sixth
amendment's
jurytrial
guarantee
that
the
judge's
authority
to
impose
criminal
punishment
must
be
limited
by
the
facts
solely
found
by
the
jury.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
well,
two
points
on
that.
one
of
them
is
that
historically
the
jury
trial
--
the
jury
found
the
verdict
of
guilt.
that,
in
itself,
authorized
the
potential
penalty
of
a
very
significant
consecutive
sentence.
oregon
has
made
a
different
policy
choice
here.
and,
to
understand
the
full
backdrop
of
it,
perhaps
the
context,
that
before
this
oregon
--
before
it
had
this
statutory
system
in
place,
it
had
very
liberal
rules
regarding
merger.
this
was
part
of
a
series
of
enactments
in
which
antimerger
provisions
were
enacted
so
the
defendant's
criminal
history
would
represent
more
accurately
the
number
of
convictions
the
jury
had
found
him
guilty
of.
therefore,
the
defendants
under
--
in
oregon
law
the
defendant
must
receive
a
separate
sentence
for
each
offense.
so
the
increased
number
of
sentences
gave
rise
to
the
possibility
of
longer
sentences
through
consecutive
sentencing.
because
in
oregon
not
only
does
an
offense
give
rise
to
a
discrete
sentence,
but
whether
the
--
the
sentence
is
concurrent
or
consecutive
is
an
aspect
of
punishment
for
that
offense.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
at
a
certain
point
in
time
there
were
judicial
rules
in
place
regarding
merger
that
may
have
resulted
in
the
entry
of
one--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--i
would
be
happy
to
submit
some
in
a
memorandum.
i
would
need
another
day
to
do
so.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
i
certainly
it
would
raise
an
issue
about
whether
--
a
different
statutory
interpretation,
of
course,
that
if
the
state
was
merely
shifting
a
burden
on
a
fact
to
the
defendant
to
disprove,
i
think
that
that
would
run
into
problems
with
this
court's
due
process
--
case
law.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
i
think
it
would
be
very
likely
if
this
court
looked
at
this
state's
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
found
that
the
--
that
the
judge
had
no
authority
to
impose
the
greater
sentence?
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
well,
again
i
think
there
would
be
a
question
about
whether
that
would
be
proper,
if
that
would
be
in
fact
shifting
an
element
over
to
the
defendant
to
disprove.
i
think
that
that
would
create--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--yes,
sure.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
well,
actually,
your
honor,
a
decision
affirming
the
oregon
supreme
court
at
this
point
would
have
little
impact
in
oregon.
in
response
to
blakely,
the
oregon
legislature
enacted
a
statutory
scheme
that
gave
back
that
enhanced
sentence
--
gave
a
procedure
by
which
they
go
to
the
jury,
and
it's
either
--
and
in
a
bifurcated
proceeding
that's--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--yes.
correct.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
in
many
instances,
just
based
on--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--no,
but
i
think
that
this
is
just
a
development
of
changing
legislative
choices
in
identifying
facts.
i
think
apprendi
articulated
the
functional
path
to
determine
the
scope
of
a
jury
trial
guarantee
when
the
state
attempts
to
relegate
a
fact
to
a
judge
rather
than
a
jury.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
in
apprendi
i
am
not
sure
that
--
that
--
i
mean
it's
a
question
of
whether
all
the
facts
have
been
found
by
the
--
by
the
jury
authorize
the
maximum
punishment.
so--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--well,
the
potential
penalty
the
defendant
faces
--
and
i
think
that
if
the
penalty
of
whether
a
gun
is
present
or
whether
a
gun
is
not
present,
assuming
that
that
would
be
enacted
by
a
legislature,
i
think
that
as
long
as
--
i
mean
the
core
question
in
apprendi
has
been
is
the
judge
imposing
a
penalty
within
the
range
authorized
by
the
jury
verdict.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
yes,
sir.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
well,
if
only
because
the
legislative
scheme
in
place
doesn't
give
the
court
authority
to
impose
restitutions
based
solely
on
the
jury's
verdict.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
the
oregon
appellate
court
doesn't--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--if
--
if
it
was
a
fact
that
was
necessary
for
the
punishment,
i
think
that
follows
within
the
rule
of
apprendi.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
although
in
apprendi
there
was
a
concern
about
elements
being
shifted
from--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--i
believe--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--i
think
legislatively
that
the
general
statutes
would
set
the
maximum
penalty
as
being
punished
as
an
adult
and
the
juvenile
system
would
be
a
different
type
of
system.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
well,
your
honor,
the
brightline
rule
of
apprendi
as
it
applies
in
the
sentencing
in
this
case
is
a
question
of
what
the
judge
can
impose
in
a
proceeding
that
was
initiated--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--i
believe
that
this
court
already
has.
for
instance,
in
greene,
under
common
law
a
defendant
who
committed
a
capital
offense
was
subject
to
the
death
penalty
and
it
was
only
upon
--
and
the
trial
court
would
get
to
exercise
discretion
whether
to
impose
it.
the
arizona
legislature
identified
those
facts
and
said,
we
are
not
trying
to
shift
elements
to
the
jury,
these
were
never
questions
for
the
jury,
but
rather
we
are
only
merely
trying
to
guide
the
court's
discretion.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
yes,
sir.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
i
believe
i
would
have
jones
v.
the
united
states
and
i
think
that
it
would
be--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--jones,
where
the--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--jones
v.
the
united
states,
where
this
court
interpreted
this
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
balance.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
then
i
think
that
it
would
--
that
this
court,
if
it
engaged
in
the
historical
analysis
it
did
and
see
that,
yes--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--i
believe
the
cases
that
were
cited
--
i
don't
think--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--yes.
but
this
court
looked
at
that
practice
and
decided
that
what
was
not
at
issue
was
the
legislative
identified
elements
as
being
found
by
the
jury,
rather
the
underlying
concern,
the
core
concern,
the
position
that
this
court
thought
that
the
framers
wanted
to
enshrine
in
the
sixth
amendment
is
that
the
judge's
authority
to
punish
is
both
created
and
limited
by
the
factual
findings
of
a
jury.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
i
believe
that
that
--
that
can
be
distinguished,
because
it
was
would
be
a
determination
not
based
on
punishment
and
not
to
impose
a
punishment
on
defendant.
however,
if--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--no,
i
believe
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
in
--
in
downstream
like
decisions
after
convictions
that
whenever
someone
was
convicted
of
an
offense
and
sentenced
to
incarceration
by
executive
agency,
you
are
subject
to
the
policies
of
that
agency
and
there
may
be
certain
due
process.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
well,
this
court
has
identified
a
bright
line
rule
that
it's
not
the
particular
of
the
fact
whether
it
would
be
something
that
would
be
historically
found
by
the
jury,
but
rather
a
fact
that
functions
to
increase
punishment.
i
think
i
have
trouble
with
the
hypothetical
saying
that
the
different
--
the
different
classification
is
sent
to
a
different
institution
is
intended
as
a
punishment
and
not
within
the
operations
of
the
--
of
the
incarceration
institution
overall.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
i
think
they
could
do
as
they
are
doing
in
what
this
court
has
decided
is
juries
are
finding
those
facts,
and
that
a
trial
court
does
not
have
to
impose
a
consecutive
sentence.
rather--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--if
ordering
the
bifurcated
proceeding
much
the
way
the
aggravating
factors
under
oregon's
guidelines
assumes
everything
handles
in
the
wake
of--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--it
falls
into
the
condition
of
what
is
defined
as
offense-related
or
offender-related
factors.
i
think
that
these
would
come
in
as
offense
related
and
probably
be
in
the
main
trial.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
well,
this
court
has
observed
repeatedly
that
--
that
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
is
one
that
can
be
waived,
and
so
the
defendants
have
the
opportunity
to
not
exercise
those
rights.
this
is
just
that
--
it's
a
right
for
the
defendant
but
it's
a
constitutional
role
that
this
court
has
identified
as
being
the
jury
role
in
our
system.
it
--
it
both
authorizes,
gives
the
arbiter
authority
to
impose
punishment
and
also
sets
the
maximum.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
well,
if
that
was
--
if
the
almendarez-torres
prior
conviction
exception
is
a
sixth
amendment
issue,
which
the
court
has
stated
that
it
is,
then
i
believe
that
there
would
not
be
required
a
jury
finding,
much
like
if
the
legislature
identified
facts
that
would
be
reflected
in
the
jury's
verdict,
or
reverted
back
to
the
common
law
rule
which
gave
the
trial
court
authority
to
impose
consecutive
sentences
merely
on
the
basis
of
if
there
was
a
conviction.
i
think
that
the
facts
identified
by
the
oregon
legislature
here
are
quite
different
than
what
would
qualify
as
the
almendarez-torres
exception.
that
exception
--
the
basis
that
it
has
if
we
rationalize
consistence
with
the
rule
is
that
a
fact
of
a
prior
conviction
has
already
been
established
in
accordance
with
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment
rights.
these
are
facts
about
the
offense
for
which
a
consecutive
sentence
is
contemplated.
so,
these
are
facts
about
the
event
that
is
being
litigated
at
that
moment.
and
the
oregon
legislature
has
predicated
the
greater
penalty
of
a
consecutive
sentence
on
those
facts,
and
precedence
instructs
that
when
the
legislature
does
so,
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
have
a
jury
find
that
fact
beyond
a
unreasonable
doubt
before
the
state
can
rely
it
on
and
impose
that
greater
penalty.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
well,
i
think
that
it
would
send
a
message
to
legislatures
that
they
can
enact
statutory
schemes
that
have
--
that
allow
for
many
instances
where
consecutive
sentences
are
authorized
based
on
the
facts
and
that
those
facts
do
not
implicate
a
apprendi
role,
and
therefore
is
a--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--yes.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
to
set
maximum
punishment
based
on
consecutiveness
rather
than,
as
they
were
doing
under
the
guideline
system,
by
allowing
a
range
and
requiring
facts
to
exceed
that
range.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
i
believe
there's
at
least
a
great
possibility
of
that,
yes.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
well,
i
think
this
court
should
not
find
those
errors
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
several
reasons:
first,
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proof
that
it's
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
has
not
attempted
to
do
before
the
oregon
courts,
the
appellate
courts;
it
has
not
done
so
before
this
court.
i
think
the
oregon
supreme
court
necessarily
concluded
that
this--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--i
think
that
praises
an
issue
of
statutory
interpretation.
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
issues--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--you
are
right,
your
honor,
but
they
are
the
ones
for
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
this
instance,
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
narrowly
concluded
that
the
findings
of
the
jury
found
--
did
not
establish
the
factual
predicate
to
impose
consecutive
sentences;
however,
they
did
not
go
into
a
comprehensive
analysis
of
what
precisely
those
facts
are,
and
in
fact
the
state
--
the
petitioner
here
is
actively
litigating
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
provisions
at
this
point.
so
it
really
is
unclear
what
precisely
are
the
facts
meant
by
this
--
by
the
statutory
terms.
i
think
it
would
put
this
court
in
a
position
to
interpret
the
state
statute
in
the
first
instance,
and
disagree
with
the
oregon
supreme
court's
implicit
conclusion,
because
it's
under
a
state
constitutional
requirement
and
also
this
court's
requirement
that
it
cannot
reverse
a
lower
court
unless
it
concludes
that
an
error
is
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
yes,
i
would
acknowledge
that
there
is
no
analysis
in
the
written
decision,
and
that
is
part
of
the
problem
because
it
didn't
identify
the
particular
facts
and
conduct
a
harmless
error
analysis
for
the
benefit
of
this
court.
however,
the
court
heard
this
case
with
a
--
in
a
consolidated
argument
with
state
v.
gray,
in
which
it
did
address
the
state's
harmless
error
argument
and
recognized
that,
in
washington
v.
recuenco,
this
court
had
said
that
a
--
is
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis.
so,
i
think
necessary
in
the
oregon
supreme
court
reversing
the
lower
court's
decision
is
that
conclusion
that
this
error
was
not
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
subsequent
to
this
case,
the
oregon
supreme
court
decided
state
versus
hagburn
--
and
i
have
a
citation
for
that,
if
you
like.
it's
--
and
that
is
identified
--
it
addresses
the
state's
harmless
error
question.
the
citation
is
345
or.
161,
and
that's
regional
reporter
190
p.
3d
1209.
and
in
that
case
we
had
sexual
offenses
arising
out
of
the
same
general
factual
scenario,
where
a
young
victim
testified
that
she
was
abused
in
two
different
rooms
on
two
different
days,
and
the
oregon
supreme
court
said
there
is
no
factual
default
in
our
consecutive
sentencing
system
that
let
--
the
jury
was
not
decided
that
this
occurred
during
the
same
criminal
episode
or
during
a
separate
criminal
episode.
and
in
light
of
the
vague
testimony
by
the
victim,
they
could
not
conclude
that
a
jury
would
have
found
that.
so
i
believe
that
the
--
that
to
the
extent
that
the
oregon
court
has
analyzed
the
statute,
that
i
think
that
it
would
--
it
backs
up
the
conclusion
that
it
found
this
not
to
be
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
i
believe
so,
if
that
kind
of
statutory
provision
was
interpreted
like
you
are
suggesting,
that
the
court
has
authority
based
solely
on
the
jury's
verdict
and
is
merely
exercising
its
discretion
and
there
is
no
requisite
factfinding
or
the
--
even
the
requirement
to
find
a
fact
to
impose
a
consecutive
sentence,
then
i
think
it
wouldn't
praise
an
apprendi
issue.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
no
entitlement
to
a
lesser
sentence,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
i
believe
so.
i
think
that
this
court
has--
mr.
ernest
g.
lannet
--not
an
entitlement
that
is
based
solely
on
the
facts
found
by
the
jury's
verdict.
i
don't
believe
it
would.
ultimately,
this
case
was
just
an
application
of
the
apprendi
rule.
the
state
asked
this
court
to
replace
that
bright-line
functional
rule
with
some
yet
unidentified
criteria
for
identifying
constitutionally
protected
elements.
it
hasn't
really
offered
this
court
with
any
suggestion
of
what
those
constitutionally
protected
elements
are
except
to
say
that
that
fact
at
issue
in
this
statute
are
not
those.
at
a
minimum
the
state
asks
for
an
exception
to
the
apprendi
rule
based
on
historical
reasoning
about
an
allegation
that
this
was
only
meant
to
control
the
discretion
of
the
sentencing
court
and
it
didn't
shift
any
elements.
and
that
kind
of
argument
was
explicitly
rejected
in
blakely,
booker,
and
cunningham.
the
oregon
legislature
authorized
consecutive
sentence
as
greater
penalty
only
for
offenses
committed
under
certain
factual
circumstances.
those
facts,
not
the
jury
--
not
found
by
the
jury
--
increase
the
defendant's
penalty
from
7-1/2
years
to
over
28
years.
affirming
the
decision
below
would
adhere
the
bright-line
rule
in
apprendi
and
it
would
preserve
the
jury's
role
in
finding
each
fact
that
authorizes
the
maximum
punishment.
thank
you.
mr.
ernest

lannet
thank
you
very
much.
