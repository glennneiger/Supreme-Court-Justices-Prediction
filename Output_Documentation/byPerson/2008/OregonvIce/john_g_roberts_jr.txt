chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-901,
oregon
v.
ice.
ms.
williams.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
lannet.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
i
get
back
to
the
question
justice
scalia
asked
about
apprendi.
is
it
--
is
it
your
position
that
if
the
offense,
based
on
all
facts
found
by
a
jury,
carried
a
maximum
sentence
of
30
years,
but
there
was
a
provision
that
the
judge
could
determine
that
if
a
firearm
was
not
used
in
the
offense,
you
would
lower
it
to
10
years,
would
that
pose
a
problem
under
apprendi?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
it
does.
all
the
facts
authorize
a
punishment
of
30
years.
and
if
it's
going
to
be
a
reduction,
that's
for
the
judge.
but
i
would
suppose
it's
not
the
problem
--
we
didn't
interpose
a
jury
between
the
defendant
and
the
state
with
respect
to
every
element,
but
only
those
elements
that
increase
the
punishment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
under
the
law
the
judge
upon
sentencing
is
supposed
to
make
a
determination
of
where
the
defendant
should
be
sent,
which
facility,
based
on
determination
of
which
one
has
the
most
room.
is
that
a
determination
that
has
to
be
made
by
the
jury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
one
was,
you
know,
the
most
horrendous
prison
in
history
and
the
other
was
one
of
--
a
country
club?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
here
in
my
hypothetical
it's
something
that
a
judge
puts
in
the
sentence.
it's
just
like
you've
got
to,
you
know,
make
restitution,
you
are
not
eligible
for
parole,
you
are
going
to
this
place
rather
than
that
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
rule
were
that
all
sentences
should
be
concurrent
unless
the
defendant
has
been
convicted
of
a
prior
federal
offense
and
then
the
sentence
runs
consecutive
to
the
federal
sentence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
it's
subject
to
judicial
review
for
judicial
review
for
abuse
of
discretion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
doesn't
give
you
an
entitlement
to
that,
to
the
exercise
of
discretion
that
isn't
abused?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
williams.
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
in
case
07-901,
oregon
versus
ice.
