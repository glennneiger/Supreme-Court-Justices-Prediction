justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
in
--
i
just
want
to
get
the
facts
right.
am
i
right,
you
did
this
historical
research,
and
if
you
start
with
apprendi
we
can
go
all
the
way
back
to
nebuchadnezzar
and
you
haven't
found
a
single
case
ever
where
it
was
a
jury
rather
than
a
judge
that
made
this
question
of
how
you
put
together
sentences
for
two
separate
crimes
committed
on
the
same
occasion?
is
that
right,
or
is
it
an
overstatement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
say
how
far
you
went
back.
i
said
as
far
as
you
went
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
what
nebuchadnezzar
found,
but
i
take
it
you
did
look
to
see
what
was
true
at
the
time
of
the
writing
of
the
constitution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
at
the
time
of
the
writing
of
the
constitution,
which
sometimes
some
of
us
feel
is
relevant,
in
that
instance
they
did
have
the
judge,
not
the
jury,
decide
how
to
create
a
total
sentence
where
the
person
had
committed
two
crimes
on
the
same
occasion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
--
what
about
restitution,
forfeiture,
taking
a
child
and
having
him
tried
as
an
adult?
what
about
probation?
what
about
alternative
drug
programs?
what
about
diversion?
i
mean,
i
can
think
of
five
or
six
where
there
might
be
a
factual
finding
necessary
to
proceed
to
a
situation
where
the
total
amount
of
punishment
is
greater
rather
than
less.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
doesn't
the
sentencing
--
doesn't
the
federal
law
define
a
sentence
to
include
restitution,
to
include
what
is
the
equivalent
of
probation?
i
mean,
there
is
a
broad
definition
of
the
word
"sentence"
in
the
law
which
includes
some
of
the
things
that
i
mentioned,
though
not
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
oregon
traditionally
if
a
burglar
had
broken
into
a
house
and
while
he
was
in
the
house
commits
a
rape,
traditionally
in
oregon
that
would
not
be
considered
two
crimes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
cite
me
an
oregon
case
which
says
a
burglar
who
breaks
in
and
commits
rape
is
only
guilty
of
one
crime?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
are
you
to
prove
these?
i
am
always
curious
as
to
the
defense
policy
as
to
why.
stricter
and
stricter
rules
here,
and
i
have
a
hard
time
figuring
out
why.
if
you
have
an
actual
case
and
you
have
to
go
to
trial,
are
you
prepared
to
put
on
all
the
evidence
that
although
you
want
to
say
that
your
client
did
neither
of
these
things,
that
if
he
did
do
them,
in
fact
they
were
just
one
thing
and
weren't
separate
things?
i
mean
are
you
prepared
to
go
into
all
that
detail
in
front
of
the
jury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
you
are
saying
that
the
standard
they
use
here
for
a
separate
sentencing,
that
it
has
to
be
a
separate
crime
and
so
forth,
has
to
go
to
the
jury.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
i
wonder
if
you
are
prepared
to
put
all
those
facts
before
the
jury,
say,
in
a
case
where
you
want
to
say
that
it
wasn't
my
defendant
who
did
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
way,
you
have
to
have
two--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
in
addition,
it
must
be
true
too
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
not
to
pay
restitution
if
the
facts
show
that
there
was
no
money
taken.
and
you
needn't,
by
the
way,
convict
the
person.
you
can
convict
him
without
finding
that.
so
the
same
would
be
true
of
restitution.
we
would
have
another
jury
to
decide
restitution,
another
thing
that
has
never
been
done;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
couldn't
impose
restitution
without
making
a
finding
as
to
how
much
money
was
taken.
so
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
can't
imagine
the
legislature--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
the
federal
courts
have
not
and
i
guess
the
same
rule
would
apply.
or
what
about
forfeiture
of
a
car
used
in
the
drug
--
again,
forfeiture,
i
guess,
would
take
place
with
another
jury
being
impanelled
to
try
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
car;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
punishment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
not.
maybe
it
would
just
be
an
in
rem
proceeding.
what
about
the
--
what
about
the
proceeding
--
what
about
the
determination
that
a
person
who
is
going
to
trial
goes
to
an
adult
court
rather
than
a
juvenile
court,
the
difference
being
the
extent
of
the
punishment?
you
are
not
entitled
to
--
a
complete
defense
to
the
punishments
that
they
could
impose.
do
you
see
where
i
am
going?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
sure
which
of
these
things
would
actual
follow
from
your
rule
and
which
wouldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
will
say
no
one
can
get
this
lower
punishment
for
the
juvenile
system
unless
the
person
is
indeed
a
juvenile.
who
makes
that
factual
finding?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
are
going
to
depart
from
what
the
framers
did
in
fact
foresee
in
this
kind
of
case
and
we
do
accept
apprendi
as
something
different
from
what
they
did
apply,
does
that
require
us
to
depart
as
well
in
all
these
other
cases
which
have
the
kinds
of
differences
that
you
have
listened
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
counsel,
don't
--
well,
the
case
that
i
mentioned
on
my
account.
i'm
thinking
about
it
--
it's
not
going
to
make
any
difference.
