justice
david
h.
souter
well,
didn't
we
furnish
the
premise
for
that
broader
reasoning?
because
we
pointed
out
that
the
traditional
role
of
the
jury
was
standing
in
effect
as
the
buffer
between
the
power
of
the
state
and
the
individual,
and
our
concern
in
the
apprendi
cases
was
that
the
concept
of
elements
was
being
manipulated
in
such
a
way
that
the
jury
no
longer
stood
in
that
--
in
effect,
that
buffer
position.
and
i
guess
the
question
here
would
be,
is
there
--
is
there
room
for
--
in
effect,
for
manipulation
by
the
law
in
the
consecutive
sentencing
scheme
or
the
potential
consecutive
sentencing
scheme,
so
that
the
jury
in
effect
loses
control
over
the
length,
the
ultimate
length
of
time
that
an
individual
is
going
to
serve?
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
the
problem
with
that
argument
the
problem
that
justice
scalia
raised
a
moment
ago,
where
you
could
have
made
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
a
mandatory
state
guideline,
but
nonetheless,
the
change
in
the
law
brought
to
bear
on
the
new
law
an
old
concept.
and
this
is
a
change
in
the
law,
to
be
sure.
i
agree
with
you,
historically.
the
judges
--
once
consecutive
sentencing
came
in
at
all,
they
were
free
to,
in
effect,
do
what
they
wanted
to,
subject
to
some
kind
of
a
rule
of
reason.
but
we've
got
to
apply
the
apprendi
concept
and
the
concern
of
the
jury
trial
right
to
this
new
situation.
so
i
don't
think
it's
an
answer
to
say,
well,
the
judge
has
never
had
such
a
--
such
a
power.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
defined
in
effect
what
was
the
functional
element
of
the
greater
offense
in
terms
of
the
--
the
power
or
the
capacity
of
the
judge
to
increase
the
sentence
beyond
the
range
that
would
have
been
--
that
would
have
established
the
maximum
in
the
absence
of
that
factfinding,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
and
aren't
we
in
exactly
the
same
position
here?
because
the
defendant
here
can
correctly
say:
i
cannot
be
sentenced
to
the
more
onerous
--
under
a
more
onerous
scheme
of
consecutive
sentencing
unless
some
fact
is
found
which
has
not
been
found
by
the
jury
in
coming
to
verdicts
of
guilty
in
any
of
these
crimes;
a
further
fact
must
be
found
to
expose
me
to
the
heavier
penalty.
and
that
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
situation
in
apprendi
with
one
possible
exception;
and
that
is,
do
you
accept,
as
i
thought
you
did,
the
proposition
that
consecutive
sentencing
is
the
heavier
penalty
or
is
a
more
onerous
sentencing
alternative.
if
you
accept
that,
i
don't
see
how
you
would
escape
the
analogy
with
apprendi.
justice
david
h.
souter
everybody
agrees.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
had
a
choice
between
two
concurrent
sentences
and
two
consecutive
sentences,
you
know
which
one
you
are
going
to
choose.
so
we
--
we
know
what
is
the
heavier
sentence
or
the
heavier
sentencing
option.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
mandatory
minimum
is
at
least
within
the
range
of
sentencing
possibilities
that
the
judge
could
impose
anyway
without
any
further
factfinding
by
the
jury.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
lannet,
one
of
the
--
or
perhaps
the
driving
force
behind
apprendi
was
the
fear
of
abuse
by
a
combination
of
the
charging
power
and
the
sentencing
power.
what
abuse
do
you
see
if
--
if
you
lose
this
case?
what
potential
abuse?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
it
would--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
--
they
would
do
by
consecutive
sentencing
the
same
sort
of
thing
that
they
were
trying
to
do
or
some
legislatures,
congress
was
trying
to
do
by
the
sentencing
factors?
