anthony
m.
kennedy
the
rule
does
bear
on
culpability,
and
culpability
sounds
like
part
of
the
definition
of
an
offense
or
a
more
serious
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
understand
why
this
happenstance
is
required
to
do
it
under
the
statute.
i
didn't
quite
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said
it's
only
happenstance.
he
has
to
do
it
under
the
statute
if
he
makes
the
finding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
it
would
have
to
be
a
bifurcated
proceeding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
historic
evidence
that
bifurcated
proceedings
were
required
before
apprendi?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
statutory
interpretation
questions
aren't
for
the
jury.
