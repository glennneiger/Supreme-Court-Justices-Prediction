justice

bader

mr.
lannet,
there
--
there
is
one
significant
difference,
i
think,
between
--
the
--
in
apprendi
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
state
labels
something
a
"sentencing
factor"
or
an
"element".
every
one
of
those
questions
that
goes
into
determining
the
maximum
length
of
a
sentence
has
to
go
to
a
jury
under
apprendi.
but
when
it
comes
to
consecutive
versus
concurrent,
it's
perfectly
okay
if
a
state
says,
our
main
rule
is
consecutive,
but
the
judge,
if
there
are
certain
mitigating
factors,
can
make
it
concurrent.
or
it
leaves
the
total
things
to
the
discretion
of
the
judge.
and
if
we
are
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
defendant,
the
state
says,
well,
we
are
not
going
to
make
it
totally
discretionary
because
we
want
to
be
more
defendant-friendly;
that
is,
we
are
putting
certain
restraints
on
the
judge.
so
it
seems
--
what
seems
odd
to
me
about
this
case
is
the
sixth
amendment
is
supposed
to
protect
the
defendant's
right.
and
here
the
state
is
saying,
we
want
to
give
the
defendant
more
of
a
right.
and
he
can
say,
that's
unconstitutional,
but
if
you
give
me
less
of
a
right,
it
would
be
perfectly
constitutional.
it's
that
enigma
that
i
think
is
very
disturbing
about
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lannet,
if
we
agree
with
your
position
and
let's
say
you
are
engaged
by
the
oregon
legislature
and
they
say
to
you:
we
don't
want
to
make
this
just
be
the
judge's
discretion
alone,
what
can
we
do
to
achieve
constitution
of
what
we
were
trying
to
achieve,
that
is
to
say
encourage
as
the
main
rule
but
--
that
is,
if
we
have
to
leave
it
to
the
judge's
discretion
but
we
want
to
rein
in
that
discretion
so
that
you
don't
have
arbitrary
differences
going
from
one
judge
to
another?
they
want
--
they
want
to
say,
yeah,
we
wanted
this
to
be
discretionary
with
the
judge,
but
we
want
to
install
certain
controls
so
that
the
trial
judges
will
be
operating
more
or
less
uniformly.
how
could
they
do
that
constitutionally?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
juries
are
find
--
that's
what
is
going
on
now,
the
juries
are
part
of
this
trial
of
guilt?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is
it?
do
they
do
it
in
the
guilt
trial
or
leave
that
up
to
the
judge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
--
where
a
defense
attorney
might
not
want
all
of
that
stuff
to
come
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
held
as
far
as
the
state
constitution
went,
this
is
fine.
it's
only
the
federal
constitution
that
stops
the
legislature
from
doing
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
way
of
--
if
you
are
right
about
the
application
of
apprendi
--
the
oregon
legislature
could
say
as
a
main
rule
is
we
leave
it
to
the
judge's
discretion.
however,
before
the
judge
makes
a
sentence
consecutive,
the
judge
should
take
account
of
the
following
factors.
that
would
be
okay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
apprendi
v.
new
jersey
decided
in
2000
and
subsequent
decisions,
this
court
interpreted
the
sixth
amendments
jury-trial
guarantee.
the
court
held
the
facts
operating
to
increase
the
maximum
punishment
for
a
particular
offense
forward
in
the
province
of
the
jury
to
decide.
thus
far,
the
court
has
applied
apprendi
only
in
the
offense
specific
context
that
supplied
the
historic
grounding
for
the
decision.
the
question
here
presented
concerns
apprendi's
applicability
to
a
sentencing
function
in
which
the
jury
traditionally
played
no
part.
when
a
defendant
has
been
tried
by
jury
and
convicted
of
multiple
offenses,
each
subject
to
discrete
sentencing
prescriptions
who
decides
whether
the
sentences
shall
be
served
one
after
the
other,
that
is
consecutively,
or
at
the
same
time,
concurrently
the
judge
or
the
jury.
most
states
in
line
with
the
common-law
tradition
leave
the
choice
entirely
up
to
the
judge.
in
some
states,
the
presumptive
rule
is
that
sentences
for
multiple
offenses
shall
run
consecutively.
sentencing
judges
however
have
discretion
to
order
concurrent
service
of
two
or
more
sentences
upon
finding
cause
therefore.
still
other
states
including
oregon
entrust
the
choice
to
judges
but
constrain
judges'
discretion
by
requiring
them
to
find
certain
facts
before
imposing
sentences
that
run
consecutively.
beyond
doubt,
the
state
may
proceed
on
the
first
two
tracks
i
just
described
without
transgressing
the
sixth
amendment.
the
sole
issue
in
dispute
is
whether
the
sixth
amendment
precludes
the
course
chosen
by
oregon
and
several
of
her
sister
states.
an
oregon
jury
found
respondent,
thomas
ice,
guilty
of
six
offenses,
two
counts
of
first-degree
burglary
each
committed
on
different
occasions
and
two
counts
each
of
them
including
two
distinct
sexual
assault
crimes.
each
of
the
paired
assault
crimes
coincided
with
one
of
the
burglaries.
the
sentencing
judge
then
made
findings
that
under
oregon
law
permitted
him
to
impose
consecutive
sentences.
first,
the
two
burglaries
constituted
separate
incidents.
second,
ice
displayed
willingness
to
commit
more
than
one
offense
during
each
criminal
episode
and
further
his
conduct
caused
qualitatively
different
harm
to
the
victim.
based
on
these
findings,
the
judge
ordered
consecutive
service
of
ice's
sentences.
a
divided
oregon
supreme
court
reversed.
the
majority
held
that
the
rule
advance
in
apprendi
require
the
jury
and
not
the
jury
to
find
the
facts
essential
to
the
imposition
of
consecutive
sentences.
we
read
apprendi's
rule
differently
and
reversed
the
oregon
supreme
court's
judgment.
apprendi
aimed
to
preserve
the
jury's
historic
roles
as
a
bulwark
between
the
state
and
the
accused
at
the
trial
determining
defendant's
guilt
or
innocence
of
an
alleged
defense.
our
opinion
makes
it
clear
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
countenance
legislative
encroachment
on
the
domain
reserved
for
the
jury
under
longstanding
common-law
practice.
our
inquiry
is
in
large
part
historical
with
those
who
framed
our
bill
of
rights
have
regarded
a
particular
fact
as
within
the
jury's
province
to
determine.
while
undertaking
this
inquiry,
we
remain
mindful
that
one
of
the
basic
attributes
of
sovereignty
retained
the
by
the
states
forming
the
united
states
is
the
declaration
and
administration
of
their
own
systems
of
criminal
justice.
these
twin
considerations,
historical
practice
and
respect
for
state
sovereignty,
counsel
against
extending
apprendi's
rule
to
the
imposition
of
consecutive
sentences
for
discrete
crimes.
first,
the
decision
whether
the
sentences
shall
be
served
concurrently
or
consecutively
was
not
made
by
juries
at
common-law.
second,
specification
of
the
sentencing
regime
for
multiple
violations
of
state
law
has
long
been
considered
the
prerogative
of
state
legislatures.
for
those
reasons
detailed
further
in
our
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
preclude
the
multiple
sentencing
scheme,
oregon's
legislature
has
adopted.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
souter
and
justice
thomas
joined.
