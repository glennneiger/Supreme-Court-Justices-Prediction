ms.
mary
h.
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
factfinding
at
issue
in
this
case
is
significantly
different
than
the
factfinding
at
issue
in
this
court's
recent
sixth
amendment
cases,
in
which
the
court
struck
down
changes
in
sentencing
practice
that
had
the
effect
of
removing
factfinding
from
the
province
of
the
jury.
in
those
cases,
the
change
in
practice
meant
that
a
defendant
could
be
convicted
by
the
jury
for
one
offense
and
then,
based
on
nonjury
factfinding,
the
defendant
could
be
sentenced
for
what
appeared
to
be
an
aggravated,
more
serious
offense
without
the
jury
having
made
all
the
factual
determinations
necessary
for
that
more
serious
offense.
that
doesn't
happen
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
jury
convicted
mr.
ice
of
six
counts,
and
the
sentence
imposed
on
each
of
those
six
convictions
satisfies
the
apprendi
rule.
there's
no
additional
jury
factfinding
that
alters
or
nonjury
factfinding,
excuse
me,
that
alters
a
specific
sentence
for
one
of
the
convictions.
instead,
what
the
factfinding
in
this
case
does
is
to
significantly
restrain
the
judge's
ability
to
decide
how
to
administer
those
multiple
sentences
for
the
multiple
convictions.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
justice
scalia,
first
on
the
point
in
terms
of
how
unique
this
statute
is,
there
are
other
states
that
have
similar
requirements,
that
there
is
initial
a
presumption
that
multiple
sentences
will
be
concurrent
unless
there
is
additional
nonjury
factfinding
that
authorizes
the
judge
to
impose
consecutive
sentences.
so
it's
not
entirely--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--it's
difficult
actually
to
come
up
with
an
exact
count,
and
the
numbers
vary
when
you
look
at
how
other
courts
have
sort
of
combined
cases,
but
perhaps
as
many
as
13,
but
as
different
states
have
sort
of
changed
their
practice
some
of
those
have
fallen
away.
it's
clear
that
there's
at
least
a
minority
of
states
that
have
this
kind
of
limitation
on
what
is
otherwise
inherent
or
a
discretionary
authority
of
the
judge
to
decide
how
to
administer
these
multiple
sentences.
the
difference
is
that
what
this
court
has
been
addressing
in
the
apprendi
line
of
cases
has
always
been
a
specific
sentence
imposed
on
a
specific
conviction.
and
what
oregon
supreme
court
did
was
to
expand
that
to
say
that,
in
addition
to
the
statutory
maximum
that
this
court
described
in
blakely,
there
is
in
effect
a
second
statutory
maximum
that
you
must
consider
when
there
are
multiple
sentences
being
imposed
for
multiple
convictions,
and
that's
the
total
period
of
incarceration
that
the
defendant
will
serve
with
and
without
the
additional
factfinding.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
additional
factfinding
extends
the
whole
duration
of
the
of
mr.
ice's
period
of
incarceration
from
90
months
to
340
months.
but
what
is
significant
is
that,
as
this
court
said
in
blakely,
the
sixth
amendment
is
a
reservation
of
jury
power;
it's
not
a
limitation
on
judicial
power.
and
i
would
submit
it's
not
a
limitation
on
legislative
power,
except
to
the
extent
that
that
exercise
of
power
removed
something
from
the
province
of
the
jury.
historically,
it's
undisputed
that
the
judge
made
this
decision
about
how
multiple
sentences
would
be
administered.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
i
think
what's
important
is
the
foundation
for
that
holding
and
the
foundation
for
the
apprendi
rule.
it
wasn't
simply
that
factfinding
in
general
that
exposes
the
defendant
to
a
harsher
punishment
is
something
that
should
would
be
better
served
by
having
it
done
by
the
jury.
it
was
that,
because
of
the
changes
in
sentencing
practices,
because
states
and
congress
have
been
taking
what
traditionally
had
been
elements
of
an
offense
and
relabeling
them
as
something
else,
as
sentencing
factors,
that
the
jury
was
no
longer
finding
what
traditionally
it
would
have
found
for
each
conviction.
it
was
no
longer
finding
what
would
have
been
each
element
of
an
offense.
so
what
the
rule
does
is
it
provides
a
bright-line
way
of
testing
what
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
an
element
for
a
specific
offense
that
would
have
been
within
the
province
of
the
jury
and
therefore
that
can't
be
removed
without
violating
the
sixth
amendment.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
oregon
supreme
court
viewed
this
case
as
in
terms
of
--
that
it
may
have
simply
been
happenstance
that
the
court
was
looking
only
at
single
convictions
and
single
sentences
being
imposed
on
those.
but
i
think
that
takes
away
the
analysis
that
the
court
used
in
reaching
the
conclusions
that
it
reached.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
well--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--no,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
i
think
the
oregon
supreme
court
viewed
the
fact
that
so
far
in
this
court's
cases
you
had
only
been
dealing
with
a
single
offense
and
a
single
sentence,
as
--
as
not
foreclosing
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
a
different
statutory
maximum
when
you
have
multiple
sentences
being
imposed
for
multiple
convictions.
and
so
the
supreme
court,
i
think,
treated
it
--
what
i
was
saying
was
it
simply
is
happenstance
that
that
had
been
the
--
the
nature
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided,
but
then
drew
from
this
court's
decision
and
from
discussion
about
punishment
a
broader
meaning
that
somehow
the
jury
must
be
involved
in
any
factual
determination
that
relates
to
the
overall
quantum
of
punishment
for
multiple
sentences
being
imposed.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
that
the
jury
does
not
lose
anything
that
the
jury
historically
had
within
its--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--but
there's
something
different
here
in
terms
of
looking
back
on
history
and
what
we
have
presently,
compared
to
when
you
are
looking
at
the
offense-specific
sentence
associated
with
a
specific
conviction,
because
the
changes
in
practice
there
had
the
effect
of
taking
away
the
ability
to
find
an
element
or
something
that
was
the
equivalent
of
an
element,
of
removing
that
from
the
jury.
and,
historically,
that
is
clearly
what
the
jury's
job
was:
to
stand
in
as
a
buffer
between
the
defendant
and
the
government.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
i
think--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't,
although
i
think
that
makes
it
a
more
difficult
situation
to
try
to
analyze,
because
there
it
is
--
it
is
focused
on
a
specific
sentence
for
a
specific
offense.
but
what
is
different
is
it
still
goes
to
not
adding
to
the
penalty
for
that
sentence,
but
adding
to
how
you
are
going
to
administer
multiple
sentences.
and
the
history
here
is
very
different.
because
what
we
have
is,
even
though
there
wasn't
a
statute
when
the
framers
would
have
looked
at
this
issue,
the
issue
did
exist.
judges
did
make
the
determination
about
how
multiple
sentences
would
be
administered.
and
what
they
would
have
considered
would
have
been
a
wide
array
of
facts
and
without
really
limitation
other
than--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--but
i
think
what's
different
is
that
the
history
at
issue
and
underlying
apprendi
actually
wasn't
that
the
judge
could
simply
make
nonjury
factfinding
and
expand
the
sentence
beyond
what
the
sentence
was
that
was
associated
with
the
jury's
verdict;
that,
in
fact,
that
was
the
problem.
because
once
there
was
additional
factfinding
that
permitted
the
judge
to
add
to
the
penalty,
that
that
had
changed
by
taking
something
away
from
what
the
jury's
role
was.
and
so
here
we
don't
have
that
same
sort
of
situation.
i
think
that
--
that
that
was
exactly
the
argument
this
court
has
rejected
in
those
cases
of
--
of
--
where
faith
and
others
have
attempted
to
suggest
that
historically
judges
were
able
to
do
this
and
so
it
shouldn't
matter
now
that
we
have
changes.
but
the
court
rejected
those
arguments
to
say
that,
no,
because
the
sentencing
practices
have
taken
something
away
from
the
jury,
that
is
why
we
have
the
sixth
amendment
violation.
so
if
in
this
circumstance
we
--
we
have
constrained
judicial
power
--
and
clearly
that's
what
this
statute
does,
is
it
tells
the
judge
that,
instead
of
being
able
to
make
this
determination
based
on
this
wide
array
of
factual
considerations,
the
judge
now
is
limited
in
what
the
judge
must
consider
to
--
to
then
exercise
discretion
in
administering
these
sentences.
but
all
of
that
is
legislative
restraint
of
judicial
power
without
touching
in
any
way
on
the
jury's
historic
role
in
--
in
how
to
deal
with
these
multiple--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--it
is
an
overstatement
only
in
the
sense
that
i
did
not
go
back
as
far
as--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--as
far
as
i
went--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
yes,
exactly.
and
that
difference
in
terms
of
the
history
of
showing
that
this
was
a
judicial
determination,
that
--
and
now
that
the
factfinding--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--but
where--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--but
what
this
court
focused
on
with
the
apprendi
rule
is
that,
although
judges
made
decisions
about
sentencing
within
a
range
of
possible
sentences,
what
judges
could
not
do
was
to
find
additional
facts
that
were
the
functional
equivalent
of
an
element
of
a
greater
offense.
and
that's
what
was
happening
with
those
new
sentencing--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--correct.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
your
honor,
i
do
not
accept
that
it
is
a
--
an
enhanced
penalty
for
any
of
the
specific
convictions.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
and
it
would
be--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--it
does
have
certainly
a
harsher
effect
on
the
defendant
than
serving
each
of
the
sentences
beginning
at
the
same
time.
but
i
think
the
same
could
be
said
in
terms
of
mandatory
minimum
sentences
and
the
factfinding
required
for
those.
we
obviously
have
cases
where
a
defendant
facing
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
is
going
to
be
confronted
with
a
harsher
sentence
than
he
would
face
without
that
additional
factor.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
and
depending
on
how
you
view
this
in
terms
of
if
you
are
looking
at
it
with
an
offense-specific
frame,
each
sentence
imposed
for
each
of
the
six
convictions
is
also
within
the
range
of
what
the
judge
can
impose.
this
additional
piece
of
when
those
sentences
begin
does
not
take
away
from
the
jury's
role.
it
does
limit
what
the
judge
could
otherwise
have
done,
and
it
does
that
limitation
by
requiring
factfinding.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
yes,
your
honor,
and
we
are
now
litigating
some
of
those
very
questions
in
light
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
decision
about
what
is
the
scope
when
you
look
beyond
the
specific
sentence
imposed
for
a
specific
conviction
and
look
at
this
greater
quantum
of
punishment--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--although,
your
honor,
some
of
these
douse-greene
decisions
that
are
made
again
by
nonjury
factfinding
do
affect
what
the
defendant's
period
of
incarceration
is
going
to
be.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
same
is
true
for
oregon,
that
the
sentence
imposed
and
if
you
--
the
--
the
judgments
are
set
out
in
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case,
that
set
out
each
of
the
sentences
imposed
for
each
of
the
six
convictions,
and
you
will
see
that
there
are
a
number
of
things
in
addition
to
the
term
of
incarceration
that
are
a
part
of
that
sentence
being
imposed.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
i--
ms.
mary
h.
williams
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
necessary
to
say
that
that
decision
is
wrong
to
be
consistent
with
the
position
i
am
asserting
here
or
the
decision
in
harris,
because
there
the
court
made
a
distinction
between
what
the
jury
traditionally
would
have
been
--
been
doing
and
determined
that
that
jury
role
was
limited
to
deciding
facts
that
increased
only
the
--
the
maximum
penalty
that
the
defendants
faced.
and
so
factfinding
tied
to
imposing
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
is
different.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
and
--
and
what
i
have
done
is
to
start
with
the
proposition
that
we
have
in
place
the
apprendi
rule
as
it
has
been
construed
in
mcmillan
and
in
harris,
but
that
this
is
a
--
a
very
different
extension
of
that
rule
beyond
anything
that
this
court
has
addressed
in
these
cases.
and
it's
an
extension
that
doesn't
have
the
same
historic
support
that
the
apprendi
rule
has.
so
i
don't
think
that
this
court
needs
to
--
certainly
this
court
doesn't
need
to
consider
what
impact
this
would
have
except
for,
i
think,
in
accepting
the
oregon
supreme
court
holding.
that
to
me
does
raise
questions
about
the
ongoing
validity
of
mcmillan
and
harris.
and
--
and
again,
there
are
ways
that
you
could
certainly
distinguish
that
and
retain
those.
but
what
it
does
is
to
focus
more
on
the
jury
as
factfinder
instead
of
focusing
on
what
the
jury's
historic
role
was
and
the
sixth
amendment
as
a
reservation
of
the
power
that
the
jury
has,
not
somehow
giving
the
jury
additional
power
beyond
what
it
has
whenever
factfinding
is
involved
that
is
--
is
related
to
a
defendant's
aggregate
punishment.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
but,
your
honor,
in
the
older
cases
we
actually
do
find
that
they
were
--
there
was
discretion
for
the
judge
to
have
the
sentences
be
served
concurrently.
it
was
viewed
as
in
some
ways
not
giving
full
effect
to
the
jury's
verdict
of
finding
the
defendant
guilty
for
multiple
offenses,
which
consecutive
sentencing
did
give
full
effect
to
that
verdict.
and
so
it
was
in
the
nature
really
of
a
mitigation
that
the
judge
could
do
to
lessen
the
severity
of
the
punishment
based
on
certain
facts
that
the
judge
would
consider
and
then
in
simply
exercising
the
judge's
discretion.
but
what
is
important
here,
i
think,
is
that
it
was
clearly
something
for
the
judge
to
decide.
once
there
were
the
multiple
convictions,
the
jury's
role
was
at
an
end,
and
it
was
then
up
to
the
judge
to
make
the
determination
about
how
to
administer
those
multiple
sentences.
and
so
long
as
we
are
not
changing
the
jury's
role
in
establishing
that
sentence
for
each
of
the
--
the
six
convictions
in
this
case,
then
we
have
not
removed
from
the
jury
anything
that
would
have
been
incorporated
within
the
sixth
amendment.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
i
think
that
if
the
--
the
law
required
the
sentences
be
concurrent
unless
additional
factfindings
were
made,
then
under
the
--
the
rule
announced
by
the
oregon
supreme
court
and
advocated
by
respondent
that
question
would
have
to
then
go
to
the
jury
even
if
it
arises
in
--
basically
in
separate
proceedings.
so
as
you
are
sentencing
in
that
separate,
second
proceeding,
it
would
still
be
a
jury
question
of
whether
those
facts
were
--
were
there
that
would
allow
the
judge
to
impose
a
consecutive
sentence.
the
oregon
statute
treats
that
a
little
bit
differently.
it
appears
to
give
the
judge
discretion
when
there
is
a
previously
imposed
judgment.
other
states
do
it
differently,
though,
and
do
require
factfinding
even
in
those
circumstances
when
there
has
been
a
judgment
imposed
in
an
entirely
separate
proceeding.
and
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
mary
h.
williams
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
the
state
is
advocating
for
here
is
not
an
abandonment
or
a
modification
of
the
apprendi
rule,
but
a
limitation
of
the
apprendi
rule
to
the
cases
in
which
this
--
the
circumstances
in
which
this
court
has
applied
it
so
far.
the
apprendi
rule
has
been
applied
as
a
bright-line
test
for
deciding
when
a
sentence
for
a
specific
condition
has
satisfied
the
sixth
amendment.
and
the
way
it
operates
is
the
rule
itself
tells
us
what
are
the
necessary
facts
that
the
jury
must
find,
and
so
there
doesn't
need
to
be
a
new
rule
to
determine
what
are
those
constitutionally
protected
facts.
the
apprendi
rule
does
that
for
us
by
saying
that
any
fact
that
exposes
a
defendant
in
a
particular
conviction
and
sentence
to
a
greater
penalty
based
on
--
that
--
based
on
a
fact
that
the
jury
has
not
found,
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
an
element
if
we
had
looked
historically
at
what
the
jury's
role
was.
and
so,
therefore,
that
additional
factfinding,
if
it
exposes
the
defendant
to
a
--
a
longer
penalty,
a
greater
penalty
for
a
specific
conviction,
it
must
be
found
by
the
jury.
and
that
is
how
the
court
has
applied
the
rule
to
this
point.
so
all
we
are
asking
is
that
the
court
clarify
that
that
is
the
full
scope
of
the
apprendi
rule.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
again,
going
back
to
what
this
court
said
in
blakely,
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
only
a
reservation
of
jury
power.
and
here
what
we
have
here
is
something
that
is
entirely
a
judicial
determination
--
that
historically
has
always
been
a
judicial
determination
--
and
the
only
overlay
we
now
have
is
a
legislative
effort
to
regulate
that
judicial
authority
through
the
mechanism
of
requiring
factfinding.
it's
something
that
the
legislature
often
does,
is
to
try
to
regulate
judicial
discretion
by
requiring
factfinding
and
by
limiting
the
kinds
of
facts
the
judge
may
consider.
and
that's
what
is
being
done
in
this
case
without
removing
anything
from
the
purview
of
the
jury.
and
so
we
would
ask
that
this
court
reverse
the
oregon
supreme
court.
thank
you.
