the
rule--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
may
seem
totally
irrelevant?
do
you
think
our
decision
in
mcmillan
v.
pennsylvania
was
correctly
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
under
your
reasoning
in
your
case
you
might
say
that
case
was
wrong.
and
i
think
it
was
wrong.
i
will
be
perfectly
candid
and
say
so.
i
think
it
was
a
very
important
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand.
but
it
seems
to
me
it
is
--
in
the
old
common
law
tradition,
following
sort
of
the
reasoning
in
the
case
you
relied
on,
mcmillan
really
should
have
come
out
the
other
way,
because
the
jury
normally
would
be
finding
the
facts
that
would
allow
the
minimum
--
the
maximum
to
go
up
or
the
minimum.
i
forget
which
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
of
course,
it's
part
of
your
position
that
historically
sentences
were
always
consecutive,
if
you
go
way
back.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
happens
with
sentences
from
multiple
states?
you
commit
the
crime
in
state
a;
you
flee.
you
are
then
tried
and
found
guilty
of
a
second
crime
in
state
b.
i
--
i
--
let's
assume
that
the
judge
in
state
b
has
considerable
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
he
intends
to
impose
a
sentence
in
b
or
send
back
to
a,
and
that
he
knows
that
a
is
going
to
be
concurrent.
under
the
theory
of
the
case
that's
advocated
by
the
respondents,
do
you
think
that
a
jury
trial
or
some
sort
of
finding
would
be
required?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
rather
broad
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
apprendi
the
opinions
were
rather
lengthy
and
discussed
precedents
at
great
length.
justice
thomas's
opinion
was
quite
scholarly
and
i
discussed
a
lot
of
old
cases.
if
this
case
that
we
have
today
had
arisen
before
apprendi
was
decided,
what
case
would
you
have
supporting
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
hear
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
jones--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
if
it
had
arisen
before
jones?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
the
historical
analysis
was
to
prove
citation
to
what
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
the
cases
in
apprendi
dealt
with
elements
of
the
crime
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
room
for
harmless
error
here?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
patently
obvious
that
both
of
the
statutory
conditions
were
fully
satisfied.
it
was
within
--
put
it
within
the
discretion
of
the
judge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
is
there
any
doubt
that
he
wanted
to
commit
an
offense
twice?
