justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it,
it,
by
reason
of
the
unusual
law
at
issue
here
i
think
it's
unusual,
i
don't
i'm
unaware
of
any
other
state
that
has
one
the
sentences
the
defendant
has
an
entitlement
to
have
the
sentences
run
concurrently
unless
a
certain
additional
fact
exists
and
that
additional
fact
is
to
be
found
by
the
judge
rather
than
by
the
jury.
so
that
if
you
take
seriously
what
what
we
have
said
in
prior
cases,
namely
that
any
fact
which
has
the
effect
of
lengthening
the
sentence
to
which
the
defendant
is
entitled
must
be
found
by
the
jury
if
you
take
that
seriously,
i
don't
see
why
it
doesn't
apply
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
others?
do
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
this
fact
can
can
turn
out
to
be
the
most
significant
fact
for
the
defendant.
i
mean,
it
could
lengthen
his
sentence
enormously.
it's
more
important
than
many
of
the
other
facts
that
we
leave
to
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
could
say
the
same
about
sentencing
in
general,
and
we
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
impose
a
limitation
upon
judicial
power
where
at
least
there
is
an
entitlement
by
law
to
a
certain
lower
sentence.
and
there
we
said
you
can't
leave
it
to
the
judge
to
decide
whether
the
facts
that
trigger
that
law
exist
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
gather
from
your
argument
that
you
would
--
you
would
be
taking
the
other
side
and
you
would
be
saying
that
it
has
to
go
to
the
jury
if,
instead
of
being
a
statute
that
applies
to
concurrent
sentences
from
various
crimes,
there
was
added
to
a
particular
crime,
if
this
crime
was
committed
with
the
use
of
a
gun,
any
sentence
imposed
shall
not
run
concurrently
but
shall
run
consecutively
with
any
other
sentence
arising
out
of
this
same
occurrence?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
it's
attached
to
a
particular
crime.
do
you
really
think
that
we
should
have
a
different
result
in
that
case
from
this
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
the
length
of
the
sentence,
that
it
was
up
to
them
and
they
considered
a
wide
array
of
facts.
so
what?
we
said
in
apprendi,
once
you
try
to
narrow
it
by
law
and
say
they
can't
do
more
than
this,
once
you
do
that,
that
fact
has
to
be
found
by
the
jury.
and
that's
what's
going
on
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
could
say
the
same
in
apprendi.
it
was
a
judicial
determination
how
much
of
a
sentence
you
were
going
to
get
from
ten
years
to
life.
it
wasn't
up
to
the
jury.
it
was
up
to
the
judge.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet
when
you
constrain
the
judge
and
you
say,
judge,
you
cannot
give
more
than
20
years
unless
the
crime
was
committed
with
a
--
with
a
gun,
we
said
suddenly
that
that
matter
can
no
longer
be
left
to
the
judge.
it's
a
matter
of
law,
and
the
facts
must
be
found
by
the
jury.
and
i
don't
see
any
difference
here.
i
mean
in
both
cases
it
was
traditionally
done
by
judges.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
lot
easier
to
limit
it
to
sentence
than
it
is
to
limit
it
to
sentence
for
a
particular
conviction
as
opposed
to
sentence
for
the
whole
ball
of
wax,
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
horribles
that
justice
breyer
proposes
would
--
would
be
overcome
if
--
if
you
just
adopted
a
rule
that
only
applies
to
sentences.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lannet,
in
--
in
connection
with
justice
ginsburg's
question,
do
you
think
that
apprendi
would
apply
differently
to
a
statute
which,
instead
of
imposing
a
higher
penalty
for
a
crime
committed
with
a
firearm,
said
that
the
penalty
will
be
30
years
for
burglary
unless
the
defendant
did
not
commit
the
crime
with
a
firearm,
in
which
case
it
will
be
15
years?
do
you
think
if
the
--
if
the
statute
were
framed
in
that
way,
that
apprendi
would
not
apply
and
we
would
leave
it
to
the
judge
whether
a
firearm
had
been
used
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
regardless
of
who
proved
it,
i
mean,
the
issue
is
can
it
be
left
to
the
judge
to
decide
whether
the
--
the
--
the
beneficent
determination
that
he
did
not
use
a
firearm
could
be
left
to
the
judge
instead
of
sending
it
to
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
a
dime's
worth
of
difference
between
that
and
apprendi.
justice
antonin
scalia
booker/fanfan
as
well,
as
adopted,
right?
i
mean
that
was
what
the
dissenters
in
booker/fanfan
would
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
core
question
is
is
the
defendant
entitled,
entitled,
to
get
no
more
than
a
certain
penalty
if
a
particular
fact
is
found.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
answer
would
be,
yes,
he
is
entitled
if
the
fact
is
found
that
he
didn't
use
a
gun
to
get
a
lesser
penalty.
and
once
you
bring
in
the
legal
entitlement,
as
i
understand
apprendi,
it
means
that
it
has
to
be
found
by
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
entitlement
to
a
lesser
sentence?
