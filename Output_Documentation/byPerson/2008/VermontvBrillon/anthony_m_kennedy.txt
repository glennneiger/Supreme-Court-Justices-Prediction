justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
chief
justice's
question,
i'm
interested
in
it
as
well,
are
there
instances
in
which
a
state-appointed
counsel
can
delay
and
have
that
not
attributed
to
the
state?
is
it
always
attributed
to
the
state--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--just
because
he's
state--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there
is
a
delay,
but
it's
not
attributable
to
the
state.
