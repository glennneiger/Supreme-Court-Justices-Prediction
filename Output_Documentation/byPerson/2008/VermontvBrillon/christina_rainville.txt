ms.
christina
rainville
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
many
reasons
to
reverse
the
vermont
supreme
court
in
this
case.
i
am
going
to
begin
by
addressing
four
reasons
as
a
matter
of
law
that
do
not
require
the
court
to
--
to
review
the
record.
the
first
is,
even
if
we
assume
that
the
public
defender
is
an
assigned
counsel
--
and
for
the
purposes
of
argument,
i
am
just
going
to
use
the
term
"public
defender".
if
we
assume
that
public
defenders
do
little
or
nothing
in
a
case,
one
cannot
have
a
rule
that
that
time
is
chargeable
under
the
speedy
trial
right
to
the
state
because
to
do
so
creates
chaos
of
constitutional
proportions
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
ms.
christina
rainville
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
the
state
did
take
the
position
that
the
eight-month
period,
which
included
the
four
months
where
attorney
sleigh
was
involved,
was
a
neutral
factor.
and
under
the
dicta
in
barker,
that
would
allow
the
court
to
apply
it
against
the
state,
although
not
to
weigh
it
heavily
as
a
--
as
a
neutral
factor.
ms.
christina
rainville
that
was
dicta
in
barker,
but
controlling
to
the
vermont
supreme
court.
before
this
court,
however,
on
these
facts--
ms.
christina
rainville
--it
was
conceded
that
it
was
a
neutral
time
period.
ms.
christina
rainville
and
--
and--
ms.
christina
rainville
--i
think
it
--
it
may
be
binding
if
the
court
determines
it's
binding.
but
i
don't
think
it
should
be
binding
because
this
court
is
considering
policy
that's
going
to
affect
all
states
and
all
courts.
and
the
issue
that
was
raised
by
the
national
governors
association,
for
example,
as
to
whether
public
defenders
can
be
state
actors
--
and
the
law
is
clear
that
they
cannot
--
that's
an
important
issue.
ms.
christina
rainville
yes.
yes,
but
also
if
you
look
at
the
record,
the
three
years
of
delay,
the
time
period
involving
mr.
sleigh
is
approximately
four
months.
if
you
take
all
four
months
where
he
was
appointed
by
the
docket
or
two
months
if
you
take
the
time
where
he
thought
and
understood
that
he
was
on
the
case,
and
in
light
of
the
three-year
delay,
that
amount
of
time
is
really
inconsequential.
ms.
christina
rainville
that's
correct.
ms.
christina
rainville
it
--
it
may
well
have
been
attributable
to
the
defender
general.
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
is
that
we
don't
have
a
record
of
why
different
attorneys
--
attorney
no.
4,
donaldson,
and
attorney
no.
5,
sleigh,
were
never
asked
what
they
did
or--
ms.
christina
rainville
--yes.
ms.
christina
rainville
absolutely.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
that
might
be
the
situation
if,
for
example,
the
defender
general
said
to
every
defendant:
if
you
want
a
trial
with
a
lawyer,
you
have
to
wait
a
year.
that's
not
what
happened
here.
what
happened
here
is
the
defender
general
was
incredibly
diligent.
he
appointed
new
counsel
five
times
the
same
day.
the
day
of
the
arraignment
mr.
ammons
was
appointed.
the
day
mr.
ammons
withdrew,
replacement
counsel,
mr.
harnett,
was
appointed.
the
day
mr.
harnett
withdrew,
replacement
counsel
was
appointed.
the
day
mr.
donaldson
withdrew,
the
docket
shows
that
sleigh
was
appointed.
five
times
the
same
day
the
defender
general
appointed
counsel.
the
sixth
time,
given
that
we
are
in
vermont,
a
very
small
state
with
few
lawyers,
he
had
difficulty
finding
a
sixth
lawyer.
but
the
defender
general
took
extraordinary
measures
and
went
to
the
vermont
legislature
and
obtained
funding,
and
the
legislature
came
up
to
the
plate
very
quickly,
in
a
matter
of
weeks.
the
last
withdrawal
of
lawyer
no.
5
happens
on
april
10th.
it's
june
20th
that
there
is
the
letter
in
the
appendix
from
the
defender
general
saying
that
the
legislature
has
approved
new
funding.
it's
--
it's
literally
a
matter
of
weeks
before
the
legislature
comes
to
the
plate
and
provides
additional
funding.
so
to
the
extent
that
--
that
that
is
state
action,
the
defender
general
has
been
incredibly
expeditious,
incredibly
diligent,
and
went
to
the
extraordinary
length
of
getting
additional
funding
for
the
sixth
lawyer.
we
--
we
would
concede--
ms.
christina
rainville
--it
could
have.
ms.
christina
rainville
the
--
the
court
could
have,
and
certainly--
ms.
christina
rainville
--the
court's
misfeasance
would
--
would
certainly
be
attributable
to
the
state,
but
we
would
argue
that
it
would
be
a
neutral
factor.
but
here,
your
honor,
brillon
would
--
in
terms
of
the
fourth
lawyer,
mr.
donaldson,
he
sought
to
have
him
fired.
and,
in
fact,
it
was
his
letter
to
the
court
and
then
a
subsequent
motion
to
the
court
to
have
that
lawyer
dismissed.
and
in
that
colloquy
when
the
--
when
the
--
the
trial
judge
asked
brillon,
do
you
want
to
have
--
do
you
still
want
to
have
him
fired
despite
all
this
delay
and
everything,
and
brillon
says
yes,
clearly
the
court
with
regard
to
donaldson
could
have
said
to
donaldson,
you
stay
on
this
case
and
get
this
case
to
trial.
but
brillon
waived
that.
brillon
said
that
he
wanted
a
new
lawyer.
with
regard
to
sleigh--
ms.
christina
rainville
--that's
moore.
ms.
christina
rainville
donaldson
was
actually
lawyer
no.
4.
ms.
christina
rainville
you
can
certainly
look
at
it
in
terms
of
details,
and
i
think
that
the
vermont
supreme
court's
findings
are
unsupported
by
the
record.
but
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
have
delays
by
state
actors,
and
even
if
you
take
the
two
or
the
four
months
for
sleigh
aside,
the
rest
of
the
delay,
three
years
of
delay
minus
--
there's
four
months,
of
course,
which
he
had
no
counsel
--
but
three
years
minus
that
time,
is
all
caused
by
non-state
actors.
ms.
christina
rainville
well,
also
in
terms
of
just
based
on
brillon's
admission,
there's
enough
for
this
court
to
decide
the
case.
he
admits
that
he
fired
three
different
lawyers.
ms.
christina
rainville
i
believe
you're
absolutely
right,
justice
alito.
in
this
case
his
conduct
was
so
unconscionable
in
threatening
both
his
lawyer,
and
the
facts
there--
ms.
christina
rainville
--i
would
--
i
wouldn't
go
that
far,
justice
stevens.
ms.
christina
rainville
because
what
if
the
state
kept
him
for
ten
years
without
a
trial?
i
don't
think
that
would
ever
happen.
certainly
on
these
facts
there's
no
basis,
given
his
conduct,
to
balance
anything
in
his
favor.
vermont's--
ms.
christina
rainville
--that's
right.
ms.
christina
rainville
i
think
you
can
decide
it
without
reviewing
the
record,
based
on
the
fact
that
you
have
a
defendant
who
fired
his
first
lawyer
six
months
into
the
case,
one
day
before
trial.
ms.
christina
rainville
and
then
filed
--
fired
a
second
lawyer
when
the
lawyer
initially
argued
and
said,
no,
no,
it's
not
true,
i've
been
working;
he
then
threatened
to
kill
the
lawyer.
then
he
at
that
time
was
told:
if
you
want
a
new
lawyer,
there's
going
to
be
inevitable
delays.
he
said:
that's
okay,
i
still
want
to
fire
this
lawyer.
then
he
went
on
and
fired
yet
another
lawyer.
ms.
christina
rainville
and
i
think
that's
a
very
important
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
christina
rainville
well,
first
let
me
address
this
point
of
two
lawyers
who
did
little
or
nothing.
in
strickland
v.
washington,
this
court
said
how
extremely
important
it
is
when
determining
ineffective
assistance
to
have
a
strong
presumption
that
counsel's
conduct
falls
within
the
wide
range
of
reasonable
professional
assistance,
and
that
there
should
be
a
hearing
to
ask
counsel
what
they
did.
here
the
vermont
supreme
court
makes
this
ruling
without
anyone
at
any
point
ever
asking
mr.
donaldson
or
mr.
sleigh
what
they
did.
ms.
christina
rainville
it
could
except
for
that
we
believe
that
this
decision
creates
an
unconstitutional
situation
in
creating
two
different
classes
of
defendant,
indigent
and
non-indigent,
in
their
speedy
trial
rights,
such
that
henceforth
the
prosecution
and
the
courts
must
treat
every
indigent
defendant
differently
merely
because
they're
indigent
when
they
ask
for
a
continuance
or
when
they
ask
for
change
of
counsel.
we
have
to
oppose
those.
so
that
we
make
the
unpleasant
choice
of
the
constitutional
due
process
violation,
that
we
would
rather
push
a
defendant
who's
indigent
to
trial
before
his
counsel's
ready,
because
the
constitutional
violation
there
is
only
one
of
due
process
and
he'll
get
a
new
trial,
versus
agreeing
to
allow
their
counsel
to
have
time
to
prepare,
in
which
case
we
risk
a
speedy
trial
violation,
where
he
will
be
able
to
walk
free
despite
his
guilt.
ms.
christina
rainville
the
second
is--
ms.
christina
rainville
--the
first
is
that
this
creates
an
unconstitutional
situation
where
there
are
two
classes
of
defendants
treated
differently
by
the
state
and
by
the
courts.
the
second
is
that
the
delays
in
this
case
were
caused
by
non-state
actors
and
as
a
matter
of
law
under
polk
county
cannot
be
a
constitutional
violation.
ms.
christina
rainville
the
third
is
that,
based
on
his
concessions,
his
admissions
in
the
brief,
he's
waived
it;
and
that's
under
barker
v.
wingo
where
the
court
talks
about
standard
waiver
doctrine
applies
in
speedy
trial.
and
the
fourth
is
that
under
the
balancing
test
based
solely
on
his
admissions,
his
conduct
ought
to
weigh
like
a
ton
of
bricks
against
whatever
happened
with
the
state.
and
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
if
i
might
for
rebuttal.
ms.
christina
rainville
very
quickly
then,
justice
ginsburg,
the
answer
to
your
question,
he
did
receive
credit
for
his
time
served.
the
important
distinction
that
the
questions
raised
show,
what's
so
fundamentally
wrong
about
this
case,
is
the
distinction
between
strickland.
there
you
ask
the
lawyers
what
they
did.
they're
given
deference.
they're
given
the
right
to
defend
themselves.
and
if
you
prove
that
it
would
have
had
an
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
case,
the
defendant
gets
a
new
trial.
here
the
lawyers
are
never
asked,
no
presumption
is
given,
and
the
defendant
is
allowed
to
walk
free
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
it's
fundamentally
wrong.
letting
a
defendant
walk
free
from
a
crime
is
an
extraordinary
remedy
that
should
only
be
given
in
an
extraordinary
case,
and
that
case
is
not
this
one.
thank
you.
