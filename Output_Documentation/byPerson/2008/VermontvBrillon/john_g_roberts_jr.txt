chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-88,
vermont
v.
brillon.
ms.
rainville.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
may
have
been
a
good
concession
below.
i
mean,
it
would
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
problem
arose
because
of
change
in
the
contract,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
that
may
well
have
been
attributable
to
the
state.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
you
are
willing
to
concede
that
there
are
situations
where
the
delay
would
be
attributable
to
the
state
because
of
systemic
problems?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
state
has
so
many
cases,
and
it's
only
willing
to
hire
one
lawyer.
that
lawyer
can't
possibly
handle
all
the
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
--
i'm
not
sure
that
we
necessarily
want
to
get
into
the
particular
details
of
a
very
complicated
record,
but
there
are
several
points
in
the
vermont
supreme
court
opinion
where
it
says
that
the
failure
of
assigned
lawyers
to
do
anything
to
move
the
case
forward
is
attributable
to
the
state.
and
i
thought
the
fundamental
principle
we
were
debating
is
whether
or
not
assigned
lawyers
who
fail
to
move
a
case
forward,
whether
that
is
attributable
to
the
defendant
or
whether
it
is
attributable
to
the
state
because
they
happen
to
work
for
the
state.
and
i
would
assume
one
way
to
dispose
of
the
case
would
be
to
decide
that
general
question
and
send
it
back
for
the
vermont
supreme
court
with
that
guidance
that
they
were
wrong,
as
a
general
matter,
to
assign
delay
caused
by
the
counsel
to
the
state,
to
sort
through
the
record
themselves.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
we'll
hear
from
ms.
kruger
first.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
kruger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i'm
sure
you
have
gone
through
the
record
and,
agreeing
with
justice
stevens
that
the
periods
where
there
wasn't
a
contract,
the
state
couldn't
provide
somebody,
do
count
against
the
state,
but
disagreeing
with
the
vermont
supreme
court
that
when
an
assigned
counsel
fails
to
move
the
case
forward
that
is
attributable
to
the
state
and
not
the
defendant,
what's
the
difference
in
time?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
nelson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sorry
to
delay
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
distinction
in
your
theory
of
the
case
between
delay
and
failure
--
failure
to
move
a
case
--
what
did
--
what
did
the
vermont
case
say:
failure
to
do
anything
to
move
the
case
forward?
when
do
we
know
that
that's
attributable
to
the
defendant,
and
when
is
it
attributable
to
the
state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
if
the
lawyer
is
a
do-nothing
lawyer,
then
i
suppose
there's
an
ineffective-assistance
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
abstract,
you
have
a
lawyer
who
is
a
public
defender
or
hired
as
a
public
defender,
and
he
keeps
asking
for
continuances
--
continuance,
continuance.
how
do
we
tell
that
that's
the
state's
problem
as
opposed
to
what
the
defendant
is
doing
through
his
lawyer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
not
an
unusual
reason
for
criminal
defense
lawyers
in
the
private
sector
to
ask
for
a
continuance.
it's
quite
common
for
the
lawyers
to
go
before
the
judge
and
say,
look,
i've
got
this
other
case
going
to
trial
next
week,
i've
got
this
and
this,
can
i
get
more
time,
and
judges
give
them
the
first
two
but
not
the
third.
and
why
in
a
case
simply
where
you're
dealing
with
a
public
defender
do
you
presume
the
opposite
and
blame
the
state
for
what's
a
quite
common
practice
in
the
private
part?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
point
is,
i
guess,
how
do
we
tell?
i
mean,
if
this
is
normal
--
i
think
it
is
normal,
i
think
it's
quite
unusual
for
a
defense
lawyer
to
be
prepared
to
go
to
trial
the
first
time
the
trial
date
is
set.
if
it
is
normal,
how
do
we
tell?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
but
--
again,
i
assume
that's
--
there
are
probably
cases
in
the
private
bar
where
that's
true
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
does
your
--
your
argument
do
to
the
fundamental
and
i
think
quite
vital
principle
in
polk
county
that
public
defenders
work
for
their
clients;
they
don't
work
for
the
state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
fairly
read,
it
does
say
the
failure
of
several
assigned
counsel
to
do
anything
to
move
the
case
forward
is
attributable
to
the
state,
because
they
didn't
do
anything,
i
guess
is
the
touchstone.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
--
just
following
up--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
just
following
up
on
your
latest
answer,
do
you
agree
that
it
has
to
be
a
systemic
problem?
i
mean,
you
gave
us
that
--
the
situation
where
the
lawyer
says
i've
got
150
cases,
i
need
a
--
need
a
continuance.
what
if
there's
none
of
that?
they've
got,
you
know,
500
public
defenders,
and
the
--
but
the
guy
still
delays.
he's
responsible
for
not
doing
anything
to
move
the
case
forward.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
still
attributable
to
the
state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
when
is
that?
the
--
you
have
the
same
situation,
the
defense
counsel
appointed
by
the
state
does
nothing
to
move
the
case
forward,
that's
as
i
understand
it
the
vermont
supreme
court
touchstone.
when
is
that
attributable
to
the
state
and
when
is
it
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
does
sound
to
me,
then,
that
you're
saying
there
has
to
be
some
systemic
problem,
that
the
rule
that
i
understand
the
vermont
supreme
court
to
have
adopted,
that
when
assigned
counsel
does
nothing
to
move
the
case
forward,
that
that's
attributable
to
the
state,
you
would
disagree
with?
you
would
say
no,
there
has
to
be
a
systemic
problem,
not
the
--
not
just
the
individual
lawyer,
but
they're
not
assigning
enough
defenders,
they're
not
supervising
them,
whatever.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
14
months,
just
so
i
understand,
that
includes
the
august
2003
through
june
2004,
when
moore
was
representing
him?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
nelson.
ms.
rainville,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
