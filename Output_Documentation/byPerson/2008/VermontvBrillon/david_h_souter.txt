justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
goes
at
least
to
one
possible
application
of
--
of
your
argument?
your
argument
for
the
state,
the
position
that
you
just
took,
would
--
would
apply
to
the
period
of
time,
as
i
understand
it,
in
which
the
individual
named,
the
defender
named
sleigh,
had
been
appointed
to
--
to
represent
the
defendant.
and
as
i
understand
it,
when
this
case
was
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
vermont,
the
state
conceded
that,
in
fact,
some
prejudice
should
be
attributed
and
it
should
be
held
against
the
state
that
sleigh
in
effect
did
nothing.
they
said,
well,
don't
hold
it
against
us
quite
as
much
as
you
might,
but,
in
any
case,
that
can
be
held
against
us.
here
you
don't
take
that
position,
and
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
it's
open
to
you
--
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
not
open
to
you
--
to
take
a
different
position
with
respect
to
sleigh
here
than
the
attorney
general
of
vermont
did
when
it
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
vermont.
and
i
--
i
have
to
assume
that
you
just
see
it
differently
from
the
way
the
attorney
general
did.
but
would
--
would
you
comment
on
--
on
the
position
that
the
state
took
and
tell
me
why
you
can
take
a
different
position
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
was
conceded,
wasn't
it,
in
the
--
in
the
vermont
supreme
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then,
why
isn't
that
concession
binding
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
is,
but
that
is
not
an
issue
that
is
necessarily
implied
by
the
--
by
the
concession
that
the
attorney
general
made
in
the
vermont
supreme
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
before
you
start,
let
me
just
make
a
comment
and
a
--
and
a
question
based
on
it.
the
comment
is
i
--
i'm
willing
to
accept
a
lot
of
what
you
say
here,
there
is
plenty
of
blame
to
go
around.
but
you
accept,
as
i
understand
it,
the
proposition
that
the
state
has
simply
got
an
affirmative
duty
to
make
some
kind
of
effective
trial
and
representation
arrangement.
it
--
it
--
it
has
that
duty
through
providing
the
public
defender,
it
has
that
duty
simply
through
providing
a
court
that
will
keep
things
moving,
and
i
think
that's
common
ground.
if
that,
as
it
seems
to
be,
is
common
ground,
then
do
we
have
anything
before
us
in
this
case,
except
sort
of
going
through
the
list
of
counsel,
the
list
of
reasons,
the
list
of
delays
and
reviewing
the
vermont
supreme
court
on,
in
effect,
the
details
that
it
assumed
in
applying
the
rule?
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
isn't
an
issue
of
principle
dividing
the
parties
here,
it's
a
series
of
issues
of
details.
is
that
an
unfair
way
to
look
at
the
case
as
we've
got
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
if
you
take
sleigh,
donaldson,
and
the
period
in
which
there
was
no
--
i
guess,
following
sleigh,
in
which
there
was
no
counsel
appointed
at
all,
you're
already
up
to
just
about
a
year.
and
a
year
is
--
is
enough
to
trigger
neil
v.
biggers.
and
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
--
what
the
fight,
what
the
serious
fight
is
about
is,
well,
within
the
further
total
of
two-year
period,
who
is
to
blame
for
this,
who
was
to
blame
to
that,
and
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
of
any
value
to
just
go
through
and
second-guess
the
supreme
court
of
vermont
on
those
details,
because
you've
got
enough
in
neil
v.
biggers
before
you
even
get
to
those
details.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect
to
that
last
point,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
let's
assume
we
--
we
have
paid
counsel
in
a
criminal
case
and,
as
a
result
of
--
of
delays
by
the
prosecution,
but
primarily
as
a
result
of
requests
for
continuance
after
continuance
after
continuance,
the
--
the
case
is
not
tried;
it's
a
simple
case
and
it's
not
tried
for
three
years.
is
--
is
it
open
to
a
reviewing
court
on
constitutional
grounds
to
say
that
the
state
has
got
an
affirmative
obligation,
a
non-delegable
obligation,
to
bring
cases
to
trial
in
a
reasonable
time?
and
whether
the
reason
for
the
failure
in
this
three-year
case
is
because
counsel
just
kept
trying
to
--
to
shove
it
off,
or
the
courts
were
not
diligent
in
scheduling
it
for
trial,
at
some
point
that
non-delegable
obligation
has
been
violated.
is
--
is
that
a
--
a
possible
constitutionally
based
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
if
the
--
what
if
we
change
the
facts
slightly.
what
if
the
defendant
himself
never
says
anything
on
the
record?
the
only
thing
we've
got
on
the
record
are
repeated
requests
by
paid
counsel
for
continuances,
and
then
after
three
years
the
defendant
fires
paid
counsel
and
says:
i've
been
sitting
in
jail
for
three
years
awaiting
trial,
and
i
shouldn't
have
to
wait
that
long.
the
state
has
failed
in
its
non-delegable
duty.
would
your
answer
still
be
the
same?
justice
david
h.
souter
lots
--
lots
of
very
effective
criminal
trial
lawyers
believe
that
the
first
tactic
is
delay,
delay,
delay,
delay,
delay.
