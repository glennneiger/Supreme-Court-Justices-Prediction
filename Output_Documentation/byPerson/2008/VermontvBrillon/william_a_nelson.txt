mr.
william
a.
nelson
oh,
excuse
me.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
apologize
for
jumping
the
gun.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
i
would
like
to
respond
to
--
to
vermont's
argument
about
there
being
no
detailed
record
about
why
these
attorneys
left
when
they
left.
and
i
--
i
think
if
they're
right,
then
that
augurs
a
remand,
that
suggests
a
remand.
but
the
reason
there
was
no
record
of
those
departures
is
because
the
courts
who
presided
over
those
departures
never
requested
an
explanation.
with
paul
donaldson,
the
matter
was
a
foregone
conclusion.
he
had
no
contract.
he
was
going
into
another
line
of
work.
so
be
it,
he's
out
of
there.
no
questioning
concerning
mr.
brillon's
complaints
about
his
inaction,
his
failure
to
investigate,
and
so
forth;
nothing
about
are
you
ready
to
go
to
trial,
what
have
you
done,
what
have
you
accomplished,
what
are
you
passing
on,
if
anything,
to
the
next
lawyer
in
line,
none
of
that.
and
with
sleigh,
the
judicial
disinterest,
if
that's
what
it
was,
the
judicial
silence
is
even
more
resounding.
sleigh
did
not
request
permission
to
withdraw.
he
put
the
court
on
notice
that
he
was
withdrawing,
and
this
came
out
of
the
blue.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
heads-up
for
the
court
that
this
was
going
to
happen,
although
sleigh
had
expressed
some
serious
reluctance
to
take
the
case
and
hadn't
done
anything.
he
didn't
--
he
had
a
filing
deadline
of
april
11th,
and
he
was
supposed
to
file
motions
on
that
date,
and
instead
of
filing
motions
he
filed
this
notice
of
withdrawal
with
no
response
from
the
court.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
depends
on
the
facts,
and
i
think
in
each
of
the
--
in
the
case
of
each
of
these
two
attorneys,
the
facts
are
different.
with
donaldson,
i
think
the
state's
responsibility
--
the
state's
involvement
in
a
do-nothing
attorney,
an
attorney
who
was
really
a
nominal
attorney,
started
from
the
beginning.
it
started
from
the
appointment
of
--
of
counsel
who
had
been
on
contract
with
the
state
to
perform
defense
services
and
was
appointed.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
it
might
mature
into
an
ineffective-assistance
claim,
but
there
couldn't
be
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
on
the
record
here
because,
well,
ineffective
assistance
is
--
is
something
that
occurs
at
a
trial.
and
it
can't
be--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--that's
--
that's
a
consequence
of
the
speedy-trial
clause
in
barker
and
strunk.
a
speedy-trial
violation
happens,
by
definition,
before
trial.
ineffective
assistance
happens,
by
definition
and
by
this
court's
decisions,
at
trial
and
can't
be
determined
until
after
trial.
unless
there
is
--
is
a
speedy
trial
right
and
unless
it's
going
to
be
enforced,
this
is
the
consequence.
and
that's--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--i
think
at
first
you
would
have
to
assume
that
the
continuances
were
sought
in
good
faith
and
--
and
for
purposes
of
defense
preparation.
if
the
defendant
had
demanded
a
speedy
trial,
as
this
defendant
had
an
early
date,
i
think
the
court,
looking
at
--
at
a
continuance
motion,
would
have
to
look
at
it
in
that
light.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
i
think,
justice
alito,
that
a
court
--
when
a
defendant
has
demanded
a
speedy
trial,
that
a
court
does
have
some
obligation
to
--
to
supervise,
to
monitor,
to
--
and
--
and
it
happens
all
the
time
in
criminal
courts.
what
have
you
done?
have
you
seen
your
client?
what
--
how
much
time
do
you
need
for
these
motions?
when
are
you
going
to
be
ready
for
trial?
that
happens
all
the
time.
and
as
the
--
as
time
goes
by,
as
the
months
pass
and
--
and
become
years,
i
think
a
court's
granting
of
continuances
has
to
be
more
grudging.
the
courts
are
under
a
duty
because
they
have
a
duty
to
assure
the
speedy-trial
right.
because
they
are
the
--
they
are
the
primary
actors
in
that,
the
court
has
a
duty
to
be--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--well,
i
--
yes,
of
course,
that's
a
--
that's
a
problem,
and
it's
a
problem
that
was
recognized
by
barker,
and
--
and
it's
a
problem
that
--
that
courts
are
well
equipped
to
handle.
they
--
courts
are
able
to
and
commonly
do.
in
fact,
it's
their
pretrial
business
--
main
pretrial
business
to
--
to
set
that
line
to
make
sure
lawyers
adhere
to
them
and
make
sure
that
the
case
goes
to
trial.
they
--
courts
are
well
equipped
to
deal
with
that.
but
i
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
your
hypothetical
is
not
this
case.
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
delays
that
were
caused
by
continuance
motions.
in
fact,
if
you
look
closely
at
the
record,
trial
dates
were
not
pushed
back
by
continuance
motions
in
this
case.
trial
dates
were
pushed
back
by
attorney
inaction
and
withdrawals.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
my
client
--
that's
correct.
my
client
fired
--
fired
the
first
attorney,
which
--
which
the
state
says
was
the
bad
act.
but
look
at
the
record
of
that
firing.
it
wasn't
really
a
firing,
of
course.
he
had
no
right
to
fire
assigned
counsel.
but
he
had
just
heard
his
lawyer
telling
the
judge,
i'm
handling
150
odd
cases,
i
cannot
be
ready
for
trial,
give
me
more
time.
i
--
i
--
i
could
be
ready
maybe
in
march
or
april,
but
i
can't
be
ready
now.
and
that
was
like
three
or
four
days
before
trial.
and
i
would
submit
that
any
client,
hearing
his
lawyer
making
those
representations
to
a
judge,
would
have
been
very
upset
and
would,
in
fact,
have
wanted
another
lawyer.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
yes,
but
the
lawyer
who
had
been
appointed
wasn't
going
to
get
those
few
more
weeks,
and
as
mr.
brillon
said
to
the
court,
i
would
rather
do
it
right
the
first
time.
being
charged
with
a
life
imprisonment
offense,
one
can
hardly
blame
him.
yes,
he
had
to
make
a
tradeoff,
but
he
had
to
do
it
because
his
lawyer
was
not
ready.
now,
we
argued
in
the
vermont
supreme
court
that
that
time
could
not--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--counsel.
counsel
moved
for
--
moved
for
a
continuance
on
february
22nd.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
and--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--pardon
me?
mr.
william
a.
nelson
i
believe
so.
the
judge
took
a
different
view.
it
was
fully
argued.
the
judge
was
the
only
one
who
had
--
the
judge
was
the
decider
on
that
one,
and
she
said
no.
you
don't
get
it.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
the
--
the
state
made
that
allegation,
and
it
made
that
claim
here.
no
court
has
found
it.
the
vermont
supreme
court
found
the
opposite.
the
vermont
supreme
court
held
that
brillon
fired
or
asked
for
the
dismissal
of
his
first
lawyer
because
he
was
not
prepared
to
go
to
trial,
which
seems
like
an
ample,
sufficient
and
supported
reason
for
the
action
he
took.
that
explains
the
case.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
that's
--
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
the
trial
court,
however,
also
didn't
make
that
finding,
although
it
was
asked
to.
and,
in
fact,
i
think
any
such
finding
would
be
entirely
speculative.
it
would
require
the
court,
the
fact
finder,
to
interpolate
various
happenings
that
are
not
of
record,
and
that
we
say
never
happened.
it
would
require
us
to
assume
that
brillon
told
ammons,
i
want
you
to
move
for
a
continuance
on
whatever
grounds
you
can
think
of,
but
the
real
reason
is
to
get
rid
of
the
judge.
and
that
ammons
would
do
that
for
his
client,
and,
you
know,
for
the
ostensible
reason
that
he
presented
to
the
court,
namely,
he
was
overloaded
and
not
prepared
to
go
to
trial,
his
secret
reason
was
to
get
rid
of
the
judge.
and
i
think
the
record
doesn't
warrant
that
kind
of
inference,
especially
since
it's
been
presented
to
and
not
accepted
by
the
state
courts.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i'm
only
saying
that
this
--
on
this
record,
the
conclusion
that
that
was
what
was
happening,
which
would
be
significant
if
the
court
were
then
to
say,
and
therefore,
it
was
done
by
the
defendant
who
wanted
delay
despite
what
he
said,
and
therefore,
this
is
time
considered
waived
under
barker.
there
is
no
basis
for
that
finding.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
actually,
this
wasn't
the
first
--
the
first
request
for
a
continuance,
chief.
ammons
had
moved
for
a
continuance
before,
and
it
had
been
denied.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
how
does
one
know?
i
think
one
--
i
think
what
makes
a
major
difference
here
is
that
brillon
had
demanded
a
speedy
trial.
he
had
done
so
long
before
ammons'
motion
for
a
continuance.
he
had
done
--
he
did
so
almost
every
chance
he
got
at
almost
every
court
hearing.
you
could,
and
i
think
the
state
does,
assume
that
this
was
all
tomfoolery
and
an
attempt
to
manipulate
the
court,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that.
that
was
the
debate
between
the
majority
and
the
dissent
at
the
state
court.
the
majority
won.
as
in
doggett,
the
--
the
state
is
now
coming
back
and
trying
to
refight
here
an
essentially
factual
issue
which
it
lost
in
--
in
the
courts
below.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
let
me
start--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--let
me
start
with
donaldson,
and
i
think
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
don't
think
donaldson
is
substantially
different
from
sleigh.
i
won't
go
over
the
circumstances
of
donaldson's
appointment,
but
once
he
was
appointed,
he
began
conversations
with
the
defender
general
about
getting
off
the
case.
and
i
think
the
sense
--
and
--
and
a
significant
fact
about
those
conversations
is
that
the
defender
general
told
donaldson
he
was
going
to
be
replaced.
we
don't
know
exactly
when
that
happened,
but
he
told
him
he
was
going
to
be
replaced
with
someone
who
was
more
competent,
more
qualified
to
deal
with
a
life
imprisonment
case.
so
this
is
not
information
which
will
light
a
fire
under
a
lawyer
to
prepare
a
case,
that
he
knows
he's
not
going
to
try.
donaldson
then
asks
for
time.
it's
the
only
request
he
ever
made
of
the
court.
the
court
gave
him
time
and
set
filing
deadlines,
and
he
missed
them.
missing
those
deadlines
should
have
been
a
red
flag
to
the
court
in
a
case
that
was
already
over
a
year
old.
the
court
let
those
deadlines
pass
without
a
word.
the
court
also
said,
we're
going
to
try
this
case
in
october.
get
ready
for
trial
in
october.
everything
should
be
filed
by
september
23rd.
and
for
a
reason,
which
the
record
has
no
explanation
for,
the
october
trial
never
happened.
donaldson
was
still
on
the
case,
his
name
was
still
on
the
case,
and
the
october
trial
date
passed
without
a
murmur.
it
was
not
until
late
november
that
donaldson
came
to
the
court
and
explained
the
situation.
now
the
court
--
i
think
the
defender
general
failed
in
his
responsibility
with
regard
to
donaldson.
that's
state
involvement.
the
court
failed
in
not
noticing
the
--
the
missed
deadlines
and
in
allowing
the
trial
date
to
pass
without
a
trial;
and
i
think
the
court
also
failed
in
its
duty
in
allowing
donaldson
off
the
case,
which
rendered
any
catch-up
time
that
he
had
to
do
pointless,
without
any
inquiry
at
all.
the
court,
it's
clear
from
the
record,
deferred
entirely
to
the
defender
general,
and
so
i
think
the
vermont
court
on
that
record
thought
that
there
was
enough
state
involvement
here
to
charge
--
to
find
the
state
responsible
and
to
weigh
some
of
that
responsibility
against
the
state.
the
court--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--it
does
nothing
to
polk
county,
and
we
acknowledge
that
--
that
paul
donaldson's
inaction
by
itself,
if
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
state,
if
the
state
did
not
involve
itself
or
condone
--
if
the
state
had
no
responsibility
with
regard
to
that
time,
the
state
would
have
no
responsibility
under
barker.
that's
perfectly
clear,
and
i
don't
think
the
vermont
supreme
court's
opinion,
fairly
read,
fairly
read
says
anything
other
than
that.
the
vermont--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--well,
i
think
i
have
two
responses
to
that.
one
is
that
in
the
context
of
the
rest
of
the
opinion,
what
the
court
was
talking
about
was
a
breakdown
of
the
system,
and
the
focus
was
on
two
actors,
both
state
actors,
the
assigning
agency,
the
defender
general,
and
the
court
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
that
both
of
those
are
indeed
state
actions,
and
that
delays
which
can
be
traced
to
them,
which
they
have
a
hand
in,
can
be
weighed
against
panned
the
state
under
barker.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
i
think
--
elsewhere
in
the
opinion,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
court
is
clear
that
--
that
they
were
faulting
the
defender
general,
and
to
a
lesser
extent
the
court.
i
think
we
are
putting
more
stress
on
the
court's
nonfeasance
than
the
vermont
supreme
court
did,
but
in
fact,
the
time
adds
up
to
the
same.
the
time,
we're
talking
14
months
from
donaldson's
assignment
until
moore's
assignment
in
august.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
okay.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
the
result
depends
on
there
being
a
systemic
problem.
i
think
in
this
case
there
was
a
systemic
problem,
and
the
court
knows
about
that
from
the
findings
of
the
indigent
defense
task
force,
which--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--no.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
absolutely
there
can
be
situations
like
that,
where
there
is
no--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--it's
not
attributable
to
the
state,
it's
attributable
to
counsel.
and
just
the
same
as
--
just
the
same
as
for
private
counsel.
we're
not
proposing
a
two-tiered
system
there.
we're--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--it
would
not
be
attributable
to
the
state
if
the
assigning
agency
was
--
had
no
fault,
had
no
supervising
duty
that
it
failed
to
perform,
that
the
lawyer
was
essentially
on
his
own
or
her
own;
and
it
would
also
assume,
i
think,
if
the
delay
went
on
long
enough,
that
there
was
no
fault
in
the
court
in
failing
to--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--to
notice
that
nothing
was
happening.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
maybe
i'm
not
using
the
word
systemic
in
the
same
sense
you
are.
all
i
would
say
is
say
is
it
doesn't
have
to
happen
to
a
lot
of
people,
it
could
happen
to
just
one
person,
but
it
would
only
happen
to
that
one
person
if
a
public,
state
agency
was
responsible
for
the
delay.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
i
think
you
can't
ignore
what
happened
before,
but
you
can
--
but
--
but
if
what
you're
saying
or
suggesting
is
that
earlier
bad
actions
result
in
a
forfeiture
of
speedy
trial
rights,
i
would
disagree.
the
way
you
--
the
way
it
matters
is
that
by
firing,
threatening,
unjustifiably
getting
rid
of
a
--
of
a
lawyer,
you
require
the
next
lawyer
to
spend
some
time
getting
up
to
speed
on
the
case.
and
that
time--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--but
that's
not
the
case
here,
and
i
think
my
answer
to
your
question
is
that
what
makes
this
a
state
response
--
failure
of
responsibility
is
that
the
state
had
the
ability
to
do
something
about
it.
if
the
state's
hands
are
tied,
if
they
run
out
of
legal
talent,
if
there's
no
other
way
to
get
counsel
on
the
case
than
by
a
broken-down
contract
system,
which
was
not
the
case--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
that
barker
works
that
way.
i
think
what
barker
says
is
that
time
which
is
attributable
to
the
defendant
gets
subtracted
from
the
total
delay;
that
that's
not
considered.
that
the
rest
of
the
time
is
a
period
which
the
state
has
to
account
for;
and
there
are
--
there
will
be
segments
of
that
time,
segments
of
that
delay
which
are
nobody's
fault,
and
those
delays
would
in
fact
be
truly
neutral
in
the
sense
of
they
would
have
no
weight
against
the
state;
and
there
are
others
that
would
count
more
or
less
heavily
against
the
state.
so
i
think
the
effect
of
what
went
on
with
jerry
altieri,
which
i
think
was
not
much
more
than
two
months
of
the
total
time
that
he
was
on
board,
i
think
the
effect
of
that
is
to
subtract
that
period,
and
then
any
catch-up
period
that
his
firing
or
his
dismissal
required,
subtract
that
period
as
well
from
the
total,
and
weigh
the
rest
more
or
less
heavily
or
perhaps
not
at
all
against
the
state.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
to
june
2004.
that's
correct.
i
--
i
think
that
the
opinion
is
not
clear
as
to
how
much
responsibility
the
vermont
court
attributed
to
the
state
for
that
period.
vermont
says
they
charged
every
second
of
the
--
of
that
time
to
the
state,
and
it's
quite
clear
from
the
opinion
that
they
didn't.
they
said
that
most
of
the
remaining
two
years,
as
of
donaldson's
appointment
in
june
of
'02,
was
attributable
to
the
state.
it's
not
clear
how
much
of
that
time
or
if
they
actually
counted
it.
i
think
that
any
precise
calculation
of
that
time
period
is
impossible.
we
argue,
and
the
record
supports,
that
much
of
that
time
had
to
do
with
ms.
moore
getting
files
together,
not
only
from
predecessor
counsel
but
from
the
state,
and
that
the
state
delayed
for
many
months
in
providing
an
updated
witness
list
with
current
addresses.
she
needed
that
to
interview
the
witnesses.
the
case
was
old,
and
she
needed
the
state's
help
there,
with
other
discovery
material
which
the
record
shows
--
it's
not
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
it
is
in
the
printed
case,
which
was
essentially
vermont
supreme
court's
equivalent
of
an
appendix.
these
materials
were
at
issue
for
moore.
she
needed
them.
the
prosecutor
was
dilatory
in
providing
them.
and
i
think
that
that's
a
kind
of
vanilla
reason
to
attribute
some
of
that
time
to
the
state.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
the
court
was
also--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--i
think
14
--
i
think
the
vermont
court
was
clear
about
the
14
months
from
donaldson
through
moore,
including
the
six
months
of
no
counsel.
it
adds
up
to
14
months.
and
then
the
rest
of
the
time
i
don't
think
you
can
put
a
number
on.
maybe
it's
not
time
that
we're
trying
to
add
up,
but
responsibility.
and
what
the
--
what
the
state
court
was
saying
was
when
a
case
is
as
old
as
this
one
was
when
moore
took
it
over,
the
court
should
be
very
vigilant
and
grudging
in
its
grants
of
continuances,
and
the
case
could
have
been
tried
sooner
than
in
eight
months.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
no.
the
14
months
goes
from
donaldson
on
june
11th,
2002,
through
moore's
appointment
in
august
2003.
thank
you,
your
honor.
