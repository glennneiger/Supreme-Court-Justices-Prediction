i
really
wanted
to
ask
you
pretty
much
exactly
the
same
question.
if
we
assume
exactly
the
terrible
way
he
fired
the
first
two
--
the
first
lawyer
certainly,
maybe
the
second,
would
it
be
true
that
no
matter
how
long
the
delay
occurred
after
that,
he
could
never
get
sixth
amendment
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this
question
about
your
reliance
on
pages
27
and
28.
if
you
describe
it
as
delays
by
the
lawyers
themselves,
i
understand
your
comment
as
being
right
on
the
nose.
but
i
understood
part
of
that
to
be
talking
about
the
situation
in
which
the
defender
general's
office
has
not
performed
its
duty
with
sufficient
promptness.
and
would
you
not
agree
if
there
were
a
period,
say,
of
seven
or
eight
months
in
which
they
just
didn't
get
around
to
appointing
a
lawyer,
that
that
should
be
charged
against
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
prejudice
factor
pretty
much
established
as
long
as
the
guy
has
to
stay
in
jail
during
this
entire
period?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
really
get
by
that
rule
if
there
were,
say,
four
years
of
delay
and
two
years
and
one
month
was
attributable
to
the
defendant
and
two
years
to
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nelson--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
is
your
judgment
on
how
much
time
all
together
was
attributable
to
the
state?
