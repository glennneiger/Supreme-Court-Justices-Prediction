ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
you
look
on
pages
27
through
28
of
the
vermont
supreme
court's
opinion,
it
is
clear
that
the
vermont
supreme
court
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
a
single
principle
that
it
applied
to
the
entirety
of
the
final
two
years
of
the
pretrial
delay
in
this
case,
and
that
is,
as
the
chief
justice
has
noted,
that
the
failure
of
defendant's
series
of
assigned
counsel
to
move
his
case
to
trial
should
be
attributable
to
the
state.
as
the
question
comes
before
the
court
today,
i
think
the
primary
point
of
dispute
is
whether
there
should
be
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
that
a
defendant
is
responsible
for
his
own
lawyer's
delays
in
situations
in
which
the
lawyer
purportedly
does
little
or
nothing
to
move
the
case
to
trial;
and
for
four
reasons
we
think
that
the
court
should
decline
to
create
a
kind
of
attorney
inaction
exception
to
the
general
rule.
first
of
all,
we
think
that
such
a
rule
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
role
of
a
lawyer
in
an
adversarial
system
and
would
undermine
a
lawyer's
authority
to
make
day-to-day
decisions
about
the
scheduling
of
pretrial
proceedings.
second,
we
think
that
such
a
rule
would
be
enormously
difficult
for
courts
to
administer
in
practice,
because
attorney
inaction
is
generally
difficult
to
discern
in
the
midst
of
pretrial
proceedings
and
the
risk
of
error
would
be
to
deprive
the
defendant
of
the
time
that
his
lawyer
may
genuinely
need
in
order
to
prepare
an
effective
defense.
the
third
reason
is
that
it
would
create
opportunities
for
gamesmanship;
it
would
create
incentives
for
defendants
to
use
the
services
of
their
lawyer
so
long
as
it
suits
them,
but
then
to
complain
later
that
the
lawyer
was
inactive
and
therefore
they
should
not
be
held
responsible
for
the
lawyer's
delay.
and
as
to
the
lawyers
themselves,
it
would
create
an
incentive
to
unreasonably
delay,
with
the
comfort
of
knowing
that
the
worst
that
would
happen
is
the
best
possible
outcome
for
their
client,
which
is
the
dismissal
of
charges
with
prejudice.
and
finally,
we
think
that
such
a
rule
would
create
an
unjustifiable
distinction
between
the
treatments
of
appointed
counsel
and
retained
counsel
in
our
system.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that
barker
makes
clear
that
defendants
can
waive
their
right
to
a
speedy
trial
and
that
indeed
defendants
will
often
desire
to
put
off
trial
as
long
as
possible.
i
think
that
in
giving
proper
consideration
to
the
barker
court's
explanation
of
the
nature
and
purposes
of
the
right,
and
in
particular
focusing
on
the
fact
that
the
only
possible
remedy
for
the
speedy
trial
violation
is
a
remedy
that
uniquely
advantages
defendants
and
poses
substantial
burdens
on
society,
we
think
ultimately
a
defendant
can't
escape
responsibility
for
continuances
that
he
has
requested
through
or
without
the
assistance
of
counsel,
simply
by
blaming
the
prosecution
for
failing
to
object
or
by
blaming
the
courts
for
failing
to
go
along.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
it
would
still
be
the
same.
we
think
that
fundamentally
the
principal
safeguard
against
that
kind
of
unreasonable
attorney-caused
delay
is
the
attorney's
ethical
obligation,
which
creates
a
duty
in
the
attorney
to
represent
his
clients
with
reasonable
diligence
and
promptness.
we
think
that
a
rule
that
would
require--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--and
i
think
it's
precisely
for
that
reason,
because
a
delay
may
ultimately
be
in
the
client's
interest,
that
this
court
should
decline
to
fashion
a
rule
that
makes
the
exercise
of
the
remedy,
which
is
again
an
extreme
remedy
that
advantages
the
defendant
alone,
exercisable
at
the
option
solely
of
the
defendant.
we
think
for
that
reason
the
defendant
necessarily
has
to
be
responsible
for
any
delays
that
are
caused
either
by
him
or
by
the
person
who
is
appointed
to
represent
him.
again,
the
ethical
duty
of
the
lawyer
is
to
zealously
advocate
on
behalf
of
the
defendant's
interests,
and
if
the
defendant
desires
to
go
to
trial
as
quickly
as
possible,
it's
still
the
lawyer's
duty
under
the
ethical
rules
to
try
to
accommodate
that
request,
while
at
the
same
time
doing
everything
he
can
to
prepare
an
effective
defense.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
we
would
agree,
justice
stevens.
in
this
case
there
were
a
period
of
a
total
of
about
six
months
during
which
the
respondent
was
not
represented
at
all,
and
we
think
in
view
of
the
state's
ultimate
responsibility
for
providing
counsel
to
indigent
defendants,
when
the
state
doesn't
comply
in
a
timely
fashion
with
that
duty,
that
delay
is
properly
attributable
to
the
state.
although
in
this
case,
because
the
delay
was
not
the
product
of
a
deliberate
effort
to
hamper
the
defense,
we
think
that
that
period
should
weigh
only
lightly
against
the
state;
and
ultimately,
given
the
other
factors
at
issue
in
this
case,
the
absence
of
any
actual
trial
prejudice
in
particular,
we
think
that
ultimately
those
six
months
are
insufficient
to
establish
a
speedy
trial
violation.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
i
think
that
that's
certainly
one
form
of
prejudice,
but
in
the
barker
balancing
--
in
barker
itself,
for
example,
the
defendant
was
incarcerated
for
ten
months
during
the
pretrial
proceedings,
and
the
court
nevertheless
found
that
there
was
no
speedy
trial
violation.
we
think
a
similar
principle
applies
in
this
case.
although
incarceration
is
obviously
prejudicial
to
defendants,
in
this
case
there
was
no
prejudice
above
and
beyond
that.
the
vermont
supreme
court
was
clear
in
finding
the
absence
of--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--i
am
not
aware
that
he
did,
but
this
court
made
clear
in
strunk
that
getting
credit
for
time
served
is
not
an
appropriate
remedy
for
a
speedy
trial
violation,
that
the
only
possible
remedy
is
again
what
the
vermont
supreme
court
did,
erroneously
in
our
view,
which
is
to
dismiss
the
charges
without
possibility
of
reindictment.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
we
think
that
a
defendant
--
we
think
that
that
rule
would
make
a
great
deal
of
sense.
when
a
defendant--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
the
vermont
supreme
court
thought
that
some
of
the
delay
was
caused
by
the
defendant
and
didn't
charge
most
of
that
period
to
the
state
to
support
its
finding
of
the
speedy
trial
violation.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
we
would
think
that
a
court
evaluating
a
speedy
trial
claim
in
that
case
would
properly
exclude
any
period
that
was
attributable
to
the
defendant
and
focus
specifically
on
that
period
that
was
attributable
to
the
state
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
right
was
violated.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
the
difference
in
time
is
--
i
think
that
the
--
as
the
case
comes
to
the
court,
the
final
11
months
of
the
pretrial
delay
is
not
seriously
in
dispute.
i
think
that
respondent
has
raised
a
number
of
arguments
about
concurrent
causes
of
delay
unrelated
to
the
performance
of
his
counsel.
i
think
that
those
arguments
are
not
properly
before
the
court
because
they
fall
well
outside
the
scope
of
the
question
as
to
which
this
court
granted
review
and
because
they
were
neither
pressed
nor
passed
on
below.
i
think
that
leaves
the
middle
14
months
of
the
pretrial
delay.
and
i
think,
given
the
vermont
concession,
the
vermont
supreme
court
focus
naturally
rests
on
the
5.5-month
period
during
which
paul
donaldson
represented
respondent.
and
we
think,
with
respect--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--we
think
with
respect
to
that
period,
we
think
that
there
is
no
basis
for
shifting
the
responsibility
for
that
delay
that
paul
donaldson
sought
before
going
to
trial
from
defendant
to
the
state
because,
as
justice
scalia
has
rightly
pointed
out,
any
contract
expiration
didn't
in
and
of
itself
end
the
attorney-client
relationship,
and
paul
donaldson
remained
the
agent
and
advocate
of
his
client
during
that
period.
