justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
there
--
isn't
there
that
very
important
principle
involved
here
that
doesn't
simply
involve
calculating
particular
periods
of
delay?
when
you
have
a
defendant
who
starts
out
by
firing
a
lawyer
and
engineering
the
withdrawal
of
another
lawyer
by
threatening
a
lawyer,
is
it
appropriate
then
to
go
through
all
of
the
subsequent
periods
and
attribute
the
delay
to
the
defendant
or
to
the
prosecution
or
as
a
neutral
factor
as
if
those,
the
initial
events,
hadn't
occurred?
we
don't
know
how
quickly
this
case
would
have
gone
to
trial
if
the
first
lawyer
hadn't
been
fired
or
if
the
third
lawyer,
i
guess
it
was,
had
not
been
threatened
and
forced
to
withdraw.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
trial
judge
supposed
to
do?
the
defense
attorney
keeps
asking
for
continuances
for
purposes
of
investigation.
i
need
more
time
to
investigate.
if
--
and
--
and
--
can
the
court
say:
you
need
to
tell
me
exactly
what
you
are
doing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
aren't
you
giving
the
attorney
a
very
perverse
incentive
there?
i
mean
the
delay
may
help
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
case,
and
if
the
--
if
the
defense
attorney
can
engineer
enough
delay,
he
or
she
may
also
produce
a
speedy-trial
violation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
by
your
client
firing
the
first
attorney,
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
--
an
attorney
is
appointed,
the
defendant
threatens
that
attorney,
the
attorney
withdraws.
a
second
attorney
is
appointed,
the
client
threatens
that
attorney,
the
attorney
withdraws,
and
then
thereafter
a
new
attorney
is
pointed,
and
there
is
great
delay.
maybe
more
--
two
or
three
attorneys
are
appointed.
there's
great
delay.
is
--
does
the
--
does
the
chain
of
events
that
started
all
this
get
taken
into
account
or
do
you
just
start
counting
the
time
from
the
appointment
of
the
last
attorney
who
wasn't
threatened?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
a
small
--
i
don't
know
how
many
lawyers
are
available
for
appointment
in
bennington.
what
if
it's
a
small
jurisdiction
where
there
aren't
that
many
who
are
available
to
be
appointed?
and
so
you
fire
the
public
defender,
you
threaten
the
first
appointed
counsel,
and
pretty
soon
you
don't
have
very
many
left,
or
the
ones
that
you
have
left
are
busy
with
other
cases
and
delay
results.
