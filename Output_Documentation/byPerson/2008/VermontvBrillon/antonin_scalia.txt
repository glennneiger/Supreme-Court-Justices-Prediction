justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
when
--
when
the
last
two
lawyers
withdrew
because
their
contracts
had
expired,
i
suppose
the
court
could
have
refused
to
permit
them
to
withdraw,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
couldn't
it
say
you
--
you
have
an
ethical
duty;
having
undertaken
representation,
and
it
being
very
difficult
to
get
anybody
else,
you
--
you
stay
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
make
it
not
the
state's
court
--
not
the
state's
fault
no
matter
what?
is
--
is
the
court's
misfeasance
the
state's
misfeasance?
do
you
attribute
that
to
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
rainville,
you
--
you
began
your
presentation
with
a
statement
that
gave
me
so
much
hope.
you
said
you
were
going
to
give
us
three
reasons
why
we
wouldn't
have
to
get
into
the
hairy
facts
of
the
case
and
could
decide
it
on
--
on
issues
of
law.
okay?
you
only
mentioned
the
first.
what
are
the
other
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
remind
us
of
the
first.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
sort
of
gets
us
into
the
facts
at
some
point.
i
mean,
that
does
get
us
into
the
facts.
what's
the
third?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
you
think
of
a
rule
that
said
where
most
of
the
delay
is
attributable
to
the
defendant,
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
walk?
that
seems
like
a
reasonable
rule.
whatever
the
delay
is,
if
most
of
it
is
attributable
to
the
defendant
himself,
it
is
--
it
is
not
a
basis
for
dismissing
the
indictment?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
make
it
easy
to
decide
this
case
because
the
--
the
supreme
court's
opinion
acknowledges
that
most
of
the
--
most
of
the
delay
was
caused
by
the
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
not
going
to
get
you
off.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
is
that
the
proper
remedy?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
he
should
appeal
to
the
judge
and
say,
look,
this
lawyer
--
is
--
is
that
the
way
you
solve
the
problem
of
--
of
an
attorney
who
is
not
ready,
like
fire
him
so
you
can
get
another
attorney?
that
seems
to
me
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
from
what
you
told
me
it
should
have
been
given,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
from
what
you
tell
me,
it
should
have
been
given
if
indeed
he
was
unable
to
prepare
adequately
for
the
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
say
that;
it
really
does
say
most
of
the
delay
was
caused
by
the
inability
or
unwillingness
of
assigned
counsel,
not
of
the
--
of
the
institution
that
appoints
them,
unwillingness
or
inability
of
assigned
counsel
to
move
the
case
forward.
that
looks
to
me
like--
