justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--with
that
particular
period.
the
trouble
that
i
have
with
that
particular
period
is
august
1,
2003,
to
june
14,
2004,
isn't
that
right?
that
is
donaldson
--
or
that's
moore?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
donaldson
was
the
first
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
go
ahead.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
--
as
i
understand
it,
that
that
first
year
the
vermont
supreme
court
agrees
with
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
said,
we're
not
counting
any
of
that
against
you.
now
we
go
into
the
second
year,
and
the
second
year
had
to
do
with
mr.
donaldson,
a
lot
of
it.
and
it
turns
out
that
mr.
donaldson
actually
had
left
the
office
within
a
few
days
of
his
having
been
appointed
to
do
this
and
then
he
never
did
anything.
so
the
supreme
court
of
vermont
says,
as
far
as
mr.
donaldson
is
concerned,
we
do
hold
that
against
the
state
for
the
reason
that
it
is
the
equivalent
of
not
giving
him
anybody.
the
guy
they
gave
him
wasn't
even
a
public
defender,
he
never
did
a
thing.
all
right.
now
we
go
to
the
third
group.
the
third
group,
the
state
agreed
they
should
be
charged.
that's
mr.
sleigh.
the
third
one
they
agreed
with
it.
they
said
lightly,
but
they
agreed
with
it.
and
as
to
the
final
group,
mrs.
moore,
well,
it
looks
like
from
the
record
as
if
the
reason
that
was
held
against
the
state
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
performance.
it
had
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
state
didn't
give
certain
records
to
her,
which
everybody
would
agree,
if
it's
true,
should
be
chargeable
to
the
prosecution,
which
is
the
state.
so
we
have
four
periods.
in
one
of
them
you
won;
in
the
second
one
he
had
no
lawyer
at
all,
according
to
the
court;
in
the
third
one
you
agree
it
should
be
chargeable
to
you;
and
in
the
fourth
one
it
has
to
do
possibly
with
prosecution
errors,
not
defense
errors.
now,
what
are
we
supposed
to
decide?
are
we
supposed
to
decide
whether
my
statement
is,
in
fact,
a
correct
statement?
if
so,
why
isn't
it?
i
guess
we
have
to
read
the
record.
but
what
else
is
there
to
decide?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
won
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
point
in
the
case?
where
--
where
is
that
in
this
case?
i
don't
know
who
--
i
didn't
see
anywhere
where
the
vermont
supreme
court
said
anything,
said
that,
except
in
the
instance
where
you
agreed
with
them.
where
is
it
in
their
--
where
is
it
--
who
are
they
are
referring
to
when
they
said
that?
is
that
donaldson?
because
i
thought
the
claim
with
donaldson
was
it
--
it
was
not
his
attribution,
nothing
he
did
was
attributed.
rather,
it
was
the
state's
failure
to
appoint
anyone,
because
to
appoint
donaldson
was
to
appoint
no
one
since
he
had
left
the
office
and
since
he
did
nothing.
now,
is
that
what
we're
supposed
to
decide:
when
a
state
appoints
a
person
who
has
already
left
the
office
and
does
nothing,
under
those
circumstances
is
it
correct
to
attribute
to
the
state
their
failure
to
appoint
anybody?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
donaldson
and
moore,
those
two
periods?
those
two
periods,
the
donaldson
period
and
the
moore
period,
seem,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
which
isn't
that
far,
they
seem
to
be
periods
when
the
state
--
when
the
court
below
was
saying
that
all
that
happened
here
was
that
the
lawyers
who
were
appointed,
did
a
very
bad
job.
you
can't
say
they
weren't
appointed.
it
isn't
that
he
didn't
have
counsel.
he
had
counsel,
and
they
just
didn't
do
very
much.
now,
why
should
that
be
accounted
against
the
stayer?
is
moore
special?
was
there
really
a
problem
of
prosecutorial
behavior?
is
donaldson
the
same
as
sleigh?
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
donaldson
a
case
where
they
--
is
equivalent
to
having
no
lawyer?
i
don't
know
how
to
deal
with
it.
