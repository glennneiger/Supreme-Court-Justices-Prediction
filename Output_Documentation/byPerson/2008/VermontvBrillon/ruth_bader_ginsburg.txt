justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
rainville,
underneath
or
between
the
lines
there
seems
to
be
great
discontent
on
the
part
of
the
vermont
supreme
court
with
the
way
the
public
defender
system
is
operating.
and
if
we
hold
for
you
as
a
matter
of
the
federal
speedy
trial
right,
the
vermont
supreme
court
could
go
back
and
decide
just
the
same
thing
under
the
vermont
constitution,
couldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
he
get
to
offset
it
against
the
time
for
the
pretrial
incarceration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
an
anomaly,
though,
isn't
it,
that
easily
might
have
matured
into
ineffective
assistance?
it
wasn't
yet,
but
if
attorneys
4
and
5,
donaldson
and
sleigh
--
if
the
case
were
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
then
the
defendant
would
get
a
new
trial,
but
here
the
result
is
he
walks.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
knowing
that
the
new
lawyer
would
have
to
start
from
scratch,
from
the
beginning,
so
it
was
going
to
take
more
time.
if
he
got
a
new
lawyer,
it
was
going
to
take
more
time
than
if
he
stayed
with
the
lawyer
who
was
already
acquainted
with
the
case
but
just
needed
a
few
more
weeks.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
wasn't
there
a
concern
about
this
defendant
trying
avoid
a
particular
judge?
that's
why
he
wanted
the
continuance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
only
did
the
vermont
supreme
court
make
that
finding,
it
does
not
hear
the
witnesses,
it
--
it
has
a
record
before
it.
i
can
understand
if
you're
talking
about
a
finding
made
by
the
court
of
first
instance,
but
the
vermont
supreme
court
is
reviewing
a
record,
it's
not
making
findings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
point
that
ms.
rainville
made?
and
she
talked
about
this
balancing
that
comes
out
of
barker,
and
she
said
you
have
to
weigh
against
the
defendant
very
heavily,
the
episodes
with
lawyer
number
one
and
number
three,
because
that
was
really
bad
stuff.
the
state
is
perhaps
responsible
for
some
of
the
other
delays,
but
she
called
those
"neutral"
in
the
weighing
process.
don't
those
two
episodes,
counsel
number
one
was
fired,
counsel
number
three,
who
says
his
life
was
threatened
by
the
defendant,
don't
those
have
to
count
very
heavily
against
the
defendant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
rest,
i
couldn't
find
in
his
final
counsel's
representation
--
i
didn't
see
anything
in
her
representation
that
would
suggest
any
lack
of
diligence
on
her
part
or
any
reason
to
count
that
in
the
speedy
trial
calculus.
that
runs
from
august
2003
to
june
2004.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
08-88,
vermont
against
brillon.
this
case
concerns
the
sixth
amendment's
guarantee
that
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
a
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
michael
brillon,
defendant
below,
respondent
here,
was
arrested
in
july
2001
on
felony
domestic
assault
and
habitual
offender
charges.
nearly
three
years
later,
in
june
2004,
he
was
tried
by
a
jury,
found
guilty
as
charged,
and
sentenced
to
12
to
20
years
in
prison.
the
vermont
supreme
court
vacated
brillon's
conviction
and
held
that
the
charges
against
him
must
be
dismissed
because
he
had
been
denied
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
during
the
time
between
brillon's
arrest
and
his
trial,
at
least
six
different
attorneys
were
appointed
to
represent
him.
brillon
fired
the
first,
who
served
from
july
2001
to
february
2002.
his
third
lawyer,
who
served
from
march
2002
until
june
2002,
was
allowed
to
withdraw
when
he
reported
that
brillon
had
threatened
his
life.
the
vermont
supreme
court
charged
against
brillon
the
delays
associated
with
those
periods,
but
charged
against
the
state
periods
in
which
assigned
counsel
failed
to
move
the
case
forward.
we
hold
that
the
vermont
supreme
court
erred
in
ranking
assigned
counsel
essentially
as
state
actors
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
assigned
counsel,
just
as
retained
counsel,
act
on
behalf
of
their
clients,
and
delays
sought
by
counsel
are
ordinarily
attributable
to
the
defendants
they
represent.
for
a
total
of
some
six
months
of
the
time
that
elapsed
between
brillon's
arrest
and
his
trial,
brillon
lacked
an
attorney.
the
state
may
be
charged
with
those
months
if
the
gaps
resulted
from
the
trial
court's
failure
to
appoint
replacement
counsel
with
dispatch.
similarly,
the
state
may
bear
responsibility
if
there
is
a
breakdown
in
the
public
defender
system.
but,
as
the
vermont
supreme
court
acknowledged,
the
record
does
not
establish
any
such
institutional
breakdown.
for
these
reasons
detailed
further
in
our
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
show
that
brillon
was
denied
his
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
joins.
