mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
townsend
is
a
jones
act
seaman
who
seeks
punitive
damages
for
the
willful
failure
to
pay
maintenance
and
cure.
like
the
unseaworthiness
claim
in
miles,
mr.
townsend's
maintenance
and
cure
claim
is
a
general
maritime
law
cause
of
action.
mr.
townsend
cannot
recover
punitive
damages
under
his
general
maritime
law
cause
of
action
because
those
damages
are
unavailable
under
the
jones
act
fela,
and
to
a
lesser
extent
dohsa.
this
court's
decision
in
miles
requires
uniformity
between
the
damages
that
a
seaman
can
recover
under
general
maritime
law
and
the
damages
that
a
seaman
can
recover
under
the
guiding
statutes.
those
guiding
statutes
again
are
the
jones
act,
the
fela,
and
the
dohsa.
those
statutes--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--first,
justice
ginsburg,
those
are
just
allegations.
there's
no
evidence--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--well,
if
--
if
those
allegations
are
true,
there's
no
distinction
between
the
willful
wanton
misconduct
that
traditionally
has
been
the
subject
of
the
dispute
about
maintenance
and
cure
and
punitive
damages
as
opposed
to
those
allegations.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
there
is
a
remedy.
and
that's
what
vaughan
v.
atkinson
provides.
in
that
case
the
--
this
court
looked
at
abuse
of
the
litigation
process
and
determined
that
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
was
entitled
to
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
i
think
there's
a
--
there's
a
number
of
potential
sanctions.
i
mean,
there
is
rule
11.
there's
the
natural
discretion
of
the
court.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
i
--
i
agree
with--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--i
agree
with
your
position
there.
and
what
i
was
trying
to
answer
the
question
is
if
someone
does
abuse
the
litigation
process,
that
is
what
vaughan
v.
atkinson
addressed.
and
it
--
it
awarded
attorneys'
fees,
which
--
which
are
unusual.
it
is
an
exception
to
the
american
rule.
and
it
is
a
deterrent
for
anyone
to
try
to
play
fast
and
loose
with--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--no.
the
--
the
dissent
mentioned
that.
but
you
cannot
speak
for
the
majority
opinion.
but
up
until
vaughan
v.
atkinson,
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
there
was
never
a
holding
where
punitive
damages
were
awarded
to
a
jones
act
seaman
for
the
failure
to
pay
maintenance
and
cure.
it
was
only
after
vaughan
v.
atkinson,
after
the
dissent
mentioned
that
concept,
that
the
issue
ever
arose
in
the
history
of
supreme
court
precedent,
circuit
precedent,
in
--
in
this
country.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
i
do
--
i
do
not
believe
--
it
is
coming
justice
harlan,
but
i
just
--
i
just
cannot
say
off
the
top
of
my
head
who
wrote
the
dissent.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
justice
ginsburg,
i
made
the
distinction
between
there's
no
case
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
before
vaughan
v.
atkinson
awarding
punitive
damages
to
a
seaman,
a
jones
act
seaman,
for
the
failure
to
pay
maintenance
and
cure.
the
case
that
you
refer
to,
the
amiable
nancy,
and
other
cases,
they
apply
to
general
maritime
law
with
respect
to
collisions,
now
with
respect
to
pollution,
and
that's
a
broader
context.
but
if
we
look
at
the
history
of
general
maritime
law,
if
we
look
at,
for
example,
calhoun,
there's
the
critical
distinction
between
non-seafarers
and
seafarers.
if
we
look
at
latsis,
there's
the
critical
distinction
between
seaman
and
longshoremen.
in
those
status,
they
define
the
class
of
persons
that
we're
looking
at
to
see
whether
they
can
recover
punitive
damages.
and
this
case
involves
a
jones
act
seaman.
and
because
it
involves
a
jones
act
seaman,
that's
the
class
of
claimant
that
we're
looking
at.
and
when
we
have
a
jones
act
seaman
the
primary
statute
that
we
look
at
is
the
jones
act.
of
course,
the
jones
act
incorporates
fela
by
reference.
and
the
dohsa,
as
miles
points
out,
also
has
an
impact
on
the
--
on
the
case.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
no
--
no,
there
is
no
specific
holding,
and
i
would
point
out
that
if
there
was,
that
would
answer
our
question
today
and
we
wouldn't
be
here.
but
that
we
do
have
is
miles,
which
is
very
clear
and
specific
about
what
damages
are
available
to
a
seaman;
and
those
damages
are
compensatory
damages.
miles
is
clear
that
the
seaman
can
be
compensated
for
pecuniary
loss,
the
seaman
can
be
compensated
for
his
pre-death
pain
and
suffering.
because
punitive
damages
are
not
compensatory
damages,
because
punitive
damages
do
not
compensate
for
pecuniary
loss,
and
because
punitive
damages
do
not
compensate
for
pre-death
pain
and
suffering,
they
are
not
available
to
a
jones
act
seaman.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
miles
was--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--justice
kennedy,
miles
was
a
wrongful
death
action.
but
when
we
look
at
miles
and
we
question,
well,
that
is
a
wrongful
death
action,
it
is
very
clear,
should
miles
apply
in
a
personal
injury
action,
then
we
need
to
--
we
--
first
we
know
--
we
look
at
the
--
the
cases
that
have
addressed
that
point.
and
first
off,
miles
does
not
say
that
the
uniformity
principle
applies
only
to
wrongful
death
actions.
secondly,
cortes,
supreme
court
precedent,
tells
us
that
the
rules
are
the
same
for
personal
injury
and
death
actions
for
maintenance
and
cure
under
the
jones
act.
in
cortes,
the
opposite
argument
was
made:
that
the
maintenance
and
cure
claim
could
proceed
for
personal
injury
but
not
for
a
death
action.
here,
the
respondent
is
making
the
argument--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--you're
absolutely
correct.
here
they
are
making
the
argument
that
the
punitive
damages
claim
could
--
can
proceed
under
the
personal
injury
side
of
the
case
but
not
the
death
side.
and
cortes
has
already
addressed
that
issue.
and--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--i
certainly
agree
with
you,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
answer
to
this
case
answers
the
question
of
what
damages
are
available
under
the
jones
act
and
--
and
fela.
but,
again,
if
you
look
at
miles,
which
analyzing
both
fela
cases,
vreeland,
for
example,
and
kraft,
which
is
a
railroad
case,
it
--
it
has
already
specifically
stated
what
compensatory
--
that
compensatory
damages
alone
are
available
under
the
death
side,
admittedly,
and
that
the
compensation
for
a
seaman
and,
therefore,
for
a
fela
employee
is
limited
to
compensation
for
pecuniary
loss
and
for
pre-death
pain
and
suffering.
also,
if
we
look
at
another
string
of
supreme
court
precedent,
it's
not
as
clear
as
miles,
but
if
we
look
at
the
--
the
other
string,
it
--
it
--
this
court
has
stated
over
and
over
that
compensatory
damages
are
--
are
what
is
available
under
the
jones
act;
compensatory
damages
are
available
under
the
fela;
and
compensatory
damages
are
available
under
dohsa.
for
example,
zicherman
is
a
post-miles
case,
and
it's
written
and
states
the
principles
very
clearly:
the
jones
act
provides
--
permits,
i
should
say,
compensation
only
for
pecuniary
losses.
and
then
it
discusses
vreeland,
which
is
a
fela
case,
and
it
says
that
the
fela
permits
compensation
only
for
pecuniary
losses.
and
so,
again,
if
we
--
if
we
look
at
the
history
on
the
death
side,
which
miles
summarizes,
but
if
we
look
on
the
personal
injury
side,
at
the
osceola,
the
iroquois,
peterson
mentions
compensatory
damages
nine
times
in
expressing
what
remedies
are
available
to
seamen.
and
so
those
railroad
cases,
those
jones
act
cases,
have
been
decided
and
have
been
a
part
of
our
precedent
for
60,
70,
80
years.
and,
of
course,
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
congress
has
amended
the
jones
act
in
1982,
with
no
tampering
with
this
history.
it
has
amended
the
jones
act
in
2006
with
no
tampering
with
the
history,
and
it
has
amended
the
jones
act
in
2008
without
any
change.
and
that's
in
light
of
guevara,
decided
in
1995;
that's
in
light
of
roy
al,
decided
in
1995,
and
10
years
plus
for
the
cases
to
percolate
and
for
congress
to
decide
whether
they
agree
with
those
policy
determinations.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
i
--
that
must
have
been
the
respondent's
brief,
because
our
position
is
--
is
--
hopefully
was
clearer
than
that,
that
punitive
damages
have
never
been
awarded
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
for
the
willful
failure
to
pay
maintenance
and
cure
until
after
--
until
after
vaughan
v.
atkinson.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
the
--
the
english
precedents
we
did
not
analyze.
we
took
miles
when
it
analyzes
lord
campbell's
act,
and
then
that
was
analyzed
in
vreeland.
and
from
that
point
forward,
miles
took
that,
that
line
of
cases--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--miles
was
a
wrongful
death
case
that
analyzed
an
unseaworthiness
cause
of
action,
which
is
brought
under
general
maritime
law.
we
are
looking
at
maintenance
and
cure,
which
is
a
claim
brought
under
general
maritime
law.
both
existed
before
the
jones
act,
unseaworthiness
and
maintenance
and
cure,
and
again
both
are
general
maritime
law
claims.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
in
that
case--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--mr.
chief
justice,
that
take
us
back
again
to
cortes,
which
this
court
has
already
decided
and
analyzed.
should
we
distinguish
between
a
death
action,
maintenance
and
cure
action
under
the
jones
act,
from
a
personal
injury
action?
and
the
unequivocal
answer
from
this
court
is
no,
that
--
that
you
should
not
treat
them
differently.
there's
no
logic
for
treating
them
differently.
we
also
need
to
remember
that
one
of
the
anomalies
that
was
--
that
was
--
that
was
cured
by
moragne
--
the
first
anomaly
cured
by
moragne
was
an
anomaly
where
the
unseaworthiness
action
would
exist
in
state
territorial
waters
but
not
in
--
i'm
sorry,
it
would
exist
in
state
territorial
waters,
but
not
on
the
high
seas.
and
that
troubled
the
moragne
court,
that
you
would
have
a
discrepancy
between
personal
injury
and
death,
and
that's
one
of
the
issues
that
they
tried
to
--
tried
to
reconcile.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
that's
correct.
my
point
is
there
was
a
difference
of
what
right
you
had
under
--
in
territorial
waters
under
unseaworthiness
that
moragne
described
as
one
of
the
anomalies.
and
the
anomaly
was
that
if
the
person
was
injured,
they
could
get
an
unseaworthiness
claim;
if
they
died,
they
could
not.
and
moragne
was
clear
that
distinguishing
between
death
and
personal
injury,
it
made
no
sense.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
moragne
did
create
some
law,
yes.
let
me
try
to
answer
the
question
in
a
different
way--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--that
is
incorrect.
if
--
if
you
read
the
cases
cited,
and
they
have
their
roots
in
some
law
review
articles
that
are
critical
of
miles,
that
--
that
don't
like
the
miles
decision,
but
if
you
read
those
cases--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--and
i'm
saying
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
those
law
review
articles
--
the
purpose
of
the
articles
is
to
criticize
miles.
those
cases
do
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
they're
presented
for
in
the
law
review
article
and
they
do
not
stand
for
the
propositions
that
they
have
been
presented
to
this
court.
they
are
not
holding
--
they
are
not
giving
an
award
of
punitive
damages
for
maintenance
and
cure
in
any
of
those
cases.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
justice
breyer,
because
maintenance
and
cure
is
so
often
linked
to
the
jones
act
and
the
unseaworthy
cause
of
action,
and
because
of
the
leverage
that
seems
to
be
brought
with
punitive
damages,
they
are
virtually
included
in
every
seaman's
case--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--from
the
get-go.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
and
--
and
i
would
have
to
estimate,
just
extrapolating
from
my
own
experience,
thousands
of
jones
act
cases
are
filed
in
the
country
every
year.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
necessarily
they
do.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
you
cannot
recover
punitive
damages
under
the--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--you
cannot
recover
punitive
damages
under
unseaworthiness
because
that's
the
same
rule
that
miles
already
decided.
miles
decided
in
unseaworthiness--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--and
--
and
--
and
i
hope
i
was
clear
that
the
can
of
worms
was
opened
by
vaughan.
no
one
awarded
it.
no
one
thought
about
it,
until
after
vaughan.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
there
--
there
are
some
pre-jones
act
cases,
like
the
amiable
nancy,
that
--
that
talk
about
punitive
damages;
and
there
are
some
cases
where
some
seamen
have
not
been
treated
very
well.
but
a
specific
look
at
the
cases
reveals
that
there
is
no
pre-jones
act
case
awarding
punitive
damages--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--the
troop
is
on
the
list.
it
is
a
case
that
we
have
looked
at,
and
it
is
--
and
again,
it
is
a
case
that
i
can
say
that
if
you
look
at
all
of
them
--
it
is
a
very
tedious
process;
there
are
a
lot
of
cases,
and
wading
through
each
one,
none
of
them
hold
or
award
punitive
damages
for
the
failure
to
pay
maintenance
and
cure.
and--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--and
our
position
is
that
even
if
there
is
--
and
there
is
not;
let
me
be
clear
--
but
even
if
there
was
one
rogue
case,
one
individual
case,
that
does
not
create
general
maritime
law.
something
more
is
needed.
for
example,
a
decision
from
this
court
would
create
general
maritime
law.
the
--
the
--
the
wilburn
boat
case
is
an
insurance
case.
there's
an
example
where
there
are
some
cases
on
the
subject
of
marine
insurance,
but
there's
not
enough
for
the
court
to
conclude
that
there
is
a
general
maritime
law
on
that
subject.
and
so
returning
again
to
this
--
this
pocket
of
cases,
they
do
not
stand
for
the
proposition
--
even
if
they
did,
if
you'll
notice,
two
of
them,
it's
the
same
district
court
judge
who
is
making
the
noise
that
he
would
have
done
this
or
he
might
have
done
this.
and
--
and
--
and
our
position
is
that
one
district
court
judge
does
not
create
general
maritime
law
by
mentioning
the
possibility
of
punitive
damages
in
one
case.
we're
much
more
comfortable
relying
on
this
court's
precedents,
the
line
of
cases
that
builds
from
moragne
to
higgingbotham
and
culminates
in
miles,
we're
much
more
comfortable
looking
at
the
history
of
the
damages
awarded
by
this
court
to
seamen,
where
it
uses
the
term
compensatory
damages,
compensation
for,
over
and
over
and
over
without
any
mention
whatsoever
of
punitive
damages.
the
punitive
damages
problem
did
not
crop
up
until
vaughan,
even
though
now
everyone
seems
to
agree
vaughan
did
not
hold
that
punitive
damages
were
available.
i
would
also
just
like
to
mention
all
the
circuit
court
cases
addressing
this
issue
hold
that
jones
act
precludes
punitive
damages,
and
any
circuit
court
that
has
addressed
this
issue
since
miles,
likewise
specifically
holds
punitive
damages
are
not
available
for
the
willful
failure
to
pay
maintenance
and
cure.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
justice
ginsburg,
i
wanted
to
respond
first
to
a
question
that
you
asked
that
i
think
there
may
have
been
some
confusion
with
respect
to
the
answer.
there
is
pain
and
suffering
available
in
a
maintenance
and
cure
claim
if
the
failure
to
pay
the
maintenance
and
cure
causes
injury,
causes
hurt.
that's
what
we
understand
from
reading
the
osceola
and
the
iroquois
as
interpreted
by
cortes.
so,
i
didn't
want
you
to
be
left
with
the
impression
that
even
if
a
maintenance
and
cure
claim
was
brought
by
itself,
if
there's
some
injury,
some
damage
beyond
the
failure
to
receive
the
maintenance
and
cure,
there
is
a
cause
of
action
that
could
lead
to,
i
think
as
you
put
it,
the
higher
award
and,
hence,
attorneys'--
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
--it's
--
it's
maintenance
and
cure
and
it
can
be
brought
either
under
the
maintenance
and
cure
with
an
injury
or
it
can
be
brought
under
the
jones
act.
you
can
choose
your
cause
of
action.
you
just
don't
recover
twice.
mr.
david
w.
mccreadie
justice
ginsburg,
we're
relying
on
supreme
court
precedent
as
opposed
to
anecdotal
information.
but
to
answer
your
question
specifically,
that's
why
i'm
explaining
that
they
do
have
the
right
to
bring
a
personal
injury
component
to
a
maintenance
and
cure
claim.
and
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make,
in
the
ninth
and
fifth
circuits
those
are
the
circuits
of
guevara
and
roy
al,
where
punitive
damages
have
been
clearly
eliminated
from
a
maintenance
and
cure
claim
for
willful
failure
to
pay.
since
1995
there's
no
dearth
of
cases.
those
remain
two
of
the
most
active
circuits
in
the
country
for
seamen's
cases.
and
whether
they
are
filing
as
just
maintenance
and
cure
or
combining
with
the
jones
act,
the
ratio
would
probably
be
the
same
as
any
other
circuit.
there
was
also
a
--
a
question
about
the
vaughan
and
--
and
what
the
dissent
knew
or
didn't
know;
and
--
and
reference
to
mccormick
on
damages.
i
think,
again,
it
is
--
it
is
a
small
point
but
it
is
interesting
to
point
out
that
mccormick
on
damages,
the
same
volume
that
the
dissent
referred
to,
specifically
states
that
punitive
damages
are
not
available
under
fela
--
under
the
fela.
and,
of
course,
the
jones
act
incorporates
fela
by
reference.
really
the
vaughan
dissent
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
miles
when
it
reached
its
decision.
if
that
court
had
had
the
benefit,
we
believe
they
would
have
found
punitive
damages
are
not
available.
