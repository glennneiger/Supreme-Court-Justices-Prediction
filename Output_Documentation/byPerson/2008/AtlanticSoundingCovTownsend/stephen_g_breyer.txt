justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
--
how
many
--
how
many
would
you
say
there
are
in
a
typical
year,
maintenance
and
cure
cases?
about,
roughly?
i
mean,
say
in
the
late
twentieth
century,
18
--
1980,
1990.
have
you
have
any
guess
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
many
would
you
guess?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh-huh.
and
they
usually
have
maintenance
and
cure
aspects.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
get
punitives
under
the
jones
act
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
unseaworthiness?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
if
i
have
about
30
cases
--
no,
i
had,
actually,
to
be
honest,
i
thought
we
found
about
12
in
the
period
around
1980-2000,
where
they
do
give
some
punitive
damages.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
i
found
about
10
cases
in
the
period
before
the
jones
act
where
there
was
something
given
--
punitive
damages
being
given
for
something,
and
there
was
something
sort
of
like
maintenance
and
cure
in
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
over
here,
there
is
one
called
--
unica
v.
u.s.
the
master
should
have
put
the
libelant
into
the
hospital,
give
him
$1,500.
it
was
partly
punitive.
considering
--
called
the
troop
--
i
mean,
i
found
some
that
are
sort
of
--
sort
of
--
i
don't
know
what
to
say.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
to
make
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
troop
gave
them
$4,000.
considering
all
the
circumstances
of
the
aggravation.
gross
neglect,
mistreatment.
"it
is
useless
to
parade
more
of
the
sickening
details.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
rolf
--
rolf
is
not
a
--
rolf
was
maintenance
and
cure
and
personal
injury
and
unseaworthiness.
so
we
don't
know
which
aspect
of
the
case
led
to
the
punitives.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
the
case
that
we
can't
find
a
single
pre-jones
act
case
where
punitives
were
awarded
and
what
was
sought
was
maintenance
and
cure?
i
--
i
found
some,
but
they
seem
ambiguous
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
best?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
have
a
history
all
the
way
back
to
catherine
of
aragon,
and
what
we've
been
able
to
find
in
these
pre-jones
act
cases
is
really
two
or
three,
or
maybe
--
i
found
ten
actually,
that
i
couldn't
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--leaning
over
in
your
direction,
i
could
take
maybe
three
or
four.
and
they
show
a
little
ambiguity.
but
give
them
all
ten,
and
that's
still
ten
out
of
hundreds
of
years
of
history.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
with
attorneys'
fees
there
is
a
compensatory
aspect.
the
--
the
basic
obligation
is
to
keep
this
seaman
alive
and
well,
and
then
you
give
him
some
wages
if
necessary,
and,
you
know,
you
give
him
medical
care.
and
--
and
now
he's
going
to
be
out
that
attorneys'
fees
as
a
result
of
his
sickness.
so
i
understand
that.
punitives
does
not
compensate
him
for
anything.
it
is
a
policy
matter
for
the
state.
he's
a
beneficiary
of
a
windfall.
and
it
seems
a
more
radical
step
to
make
something
up
out
of
whole
cloth
here
with
punitives
than
it
does
with
attorneys'
fees.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
it
would
be
a
good
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
--
the
problem
here
is
it
has
pros
and
cons.
i
was
quite
moved
by
the
brief
--
the
citation
that
professor
robertson
made
of
all
of
those
old
cases
until
we
looked
them
up.
and
--
and
then
i
found
they
seem
to
stand
for
a
little
bit
less
than
i
had
the
impression
they
stood
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
we'd
be
making
this
up
out
of
whole
cloth,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
miles
says
don't
do
that.
