chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-214,
atlantic
sounding
v.
townsend.
mr.
mccreadie.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
your
friend
on
the
other
side
distinguishes
that
argument
by
noting
that
death
is
different.
as
he
puts
it,
we're
all
going
to
die,
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
have
different
considerations
under
the
maintenance
and
cure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
sullivan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
pre-vaughan
case
that
awarded
punitive
damages
--
awarded
punitive
damages
in
a
maintenance
and
cure
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
am
--
what
--
which
--
any
case
from
this
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
--
if
the
--
if
the
existence
of
the
punitive
damages
and
maintenance
cure
were
as
well
established,
why
wasn't
that
mentioned
in
terms
in
the
vaughan
majority?
it
only
comes
up
in
the
vaughan
dissent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
as
sure
--
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
that.
where
--
in
other
areas
where
we
allow
punitive
damages
it
hasn't
resulted
in
the
cases
going
away.
quite
the
opposite.
it
seems
it
has
given
rise
to
a
variety
of
claims
on
both
sides.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
but
the
normal
medical
malpractice
area
has
given
rise
to
a
lot
of
punitive
damage
litigation.
i
don't
know
why
this
would
be
any
different.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
it
--
whether
it
gives
rise
to
more
litigation
or
not,
it
is
still
a
significant
and
it
will
give
rise
to
greater
costs
on
the
part
of
the
--
the
shipper
which
will
be
passed
on,
as
is
the
case
in
a
lot
of
areas
where
you
have
punitive
damages,
it
will
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer.
awarded.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
even
if
they're
not.
in
other
words,
you
were
saying,
look,
to
avoid
punitive
damages,
the
shipowner
is
going
to
make
sure
that
there
--
that
that
more
expensive
test
is
provided.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
doesn't
make
--
that
doesn't
mean
there
are
no
costs
involved
in
ruling
in
your
favor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
mccreadie,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
today
in
case
08-214,
atlantic
sounding
company
versus
townsend.
