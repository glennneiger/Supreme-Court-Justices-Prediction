justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
and
i'm
sure
it's
one
of
much
greater
interest
than
the
previous
case.
respondent,
edgar
l.
townsend,
was
injured
while
serving
as
a
crew
member
on
the
motor
tug
thomas,
no
relation.
this
tug
is
a
vessel
owned
by
petitioners.
respondent
filed
a
suit
against
petitioners
under
the
jones
act
and
general
maritime
law
contending
among
other
things
that
petitioners'
improperly
denied
him
maintenance
and
cure.
maintenance
and
cure
is
the
term
used
to
describe
the
longstanding
obligation
of
vessel
owners
to
provide
food,
lodging,
and
medical
treatment
to
injured
crewmen.
respondent
sought
punitive
damages
for
the
denial
of
maintenance
and
cure.
petitioners
sought
to
dismiss
the
punitive
damages
claim
arguing
that
this
court's
decision
in
miles
versus
apex
marine
corporation
limits
recovery
for
the
denial
of
maintenance
and
cure
to
remedies
available
under
the
jones
act
and
that
punitive
damages
are
not
available
under
that
statute.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss
finding
that
punitive
damages
are
available
under
general
maritime
law
and
authorized
an
interlocutory
appeal.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
holding
that
it
was
bound
by
certain
precedent
to
permit
claims
for
punitive
damages
for
a
willful
failure
to
provide
maintenance
and
cure.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
punitive
damages
have
long
been
available
at
common
law
and
this
tradition
extends
to
maritime
cases
or
maritime
claims.
there
is
no
evidence
that
claims
for
maintenance
and
cure
were
excluded
from
this
general
admiralty
rule.
to
the
contrary,
the
pre-jones
act
evidence
indicates
that
punitive
damages
were
available
to
such
claim
--
for
such
claims
under
the
appropriate
factual
circumstances.
moreover,
the
enactment
of
the
jones
act
in
1920
did
not
abridge
the
traditional
remedies
afforded
under
general
maritime
law
for
maintenance
and
cure.
we
have
repeatedly
held
that
the
act
was
intended
to
supplement
rather
than
restrict
traditional
remedies.
finally,
this
court's
decision
in
miles
does
not
limit
the
remedies
of
this
general
maritime
claim
to
those
remedies
provided
by
the
jones
act.
in
miles,
the
court
restricted
memories
--
remedies
for
wrongful
death
to
those
that
congress
had
statutorily
provided
in
wrongful
death
actions.
but
the
court
did
so
because
wrongful
death
actions
were
not
historically
recognized
under
general
maritime
claims
or
maritime
law.
here
in
contrast,
the
cause
of
action
for
maintenance
and
cure
and
the
remedy
of
punitive
damages
were
available
long
before
the
jones
act
was
passed.
miles
does
not
require
the
court
to
alter
the
historically
availability
--
the
historical
availability
of
punitive
damages
for
the
willful
or
wanton
failure
to
comply
with
the
duty
of
maintenance
and
cure.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia,
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined.
