justice
antonin
scalia
is
any
of
them
called
punitive
damages?
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
a
court
has--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
punitive
damages,
of
course,
requires
that
you
first
find
the
guilty
person
to
lose
the
case.
so
what
if
a
person
makes
these
terrible
allegations,
but
ends
up
winning
the
case
anyway,
and
--
and
--
well,
you
couldn't
impose
punitive
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
got
to
call
it
something
else,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
whose
dissent
was
that?
i
had
forgotten
that.
whose
dissent
was
it?
do
you
recall?
stewart?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
that
the
maintenance
and
cure
claim
could
proceed
or
that
the
punitive
damages
claim
could
be
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
--
why
does
joining
it
to
a
jones
act
case
help?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
stewart
knew
more
about
these
--
these
obscure,
ancient
cases
than
we
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
he
knew
more
about
these
obscure,
ancient
cases
than
we
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
had
he
had
the
benefit
of
briefs
by
professor
robertson
and
--
i
think
not,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
just
sort
of
off
the
top
of
his
head
that
he
thought
there
should
be
punitive
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
--
they
normally
are,
but
the
question
is
whether
there
--
whether
this
--
this
is
a
different
quiver.
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
abandoned
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
we've
abandoned
that
in
this
area.
we've
said
that
what
we
do
with
these
admiralty
causes
of
action
we
should
be
guided
by
what
congress
has
done
in
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
in
the
jones
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
acknowledge
that
there
are
no
punitive
damages
available
in
the
event
of
death?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
--
that
--
now,
you
want
to
talk
about
what's
a
sensible
system
and
what
is
not
a
sensible
system.
in
the
days
when
massachusetts
used
to
have
a
--
when
i
was
in
law
school,
they
had
a
compensation
limit
for
wrongful
death,
but
to
limit
for
--
for
pain
and
suffering,
for
negligence;
and
--
and,
you
know,
the
line
was
back
her
up
again
--
back
her
up
again,
sam,
she's
not
quite
dead
yet.
[laughter]
i
mean,
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
--
is
--
is
this
going
to
be
the
same
thing,
where
--
where
the
shipowner
says,
well,
you
know,
if
--
if
--
if
i
treat
him
badly
enough
that
he
dies,
i
don't
get
hit
with
the
punitive
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
it
is
invited,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
certainly
--
it
certainly
makes
these
maintenance
and
care
cases
a
lot
more
attractive
to
the
plaintiffs'
bar,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
one
of
your
complaints
is
there's
just
no
money
in
it.
the
claim
is
not
for
that
much.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
it
shouldn't
be
the
goal.
but
we're
--
we're
inquiring
into
the
question
of
whether
granting
punitive
damages
will
increase
or
decrease
the
number
of
lawsuits.
i
--
i
--
i
would
think
it
would
be
astounding
if
it
would
decrease
the
number
of
lawsuits.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
wish
it
were
as
clearcut
as
that.
i
mean,
what
--
what
if
the
seaman
says,
you
know,
i
should
have
had
this
very
expensive
treatment?
and
the
shipowner's
medical
counsel
said,
no,
this
treatment
is
--
is
not
necessary.
is
that
--
is
that
a
punitive
damages
claim?
i
bet
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
going
to
say
that
was
willful
and
wanton.
i
obviously
needed
this
--
this
more
expensive
treatment.
he
just
didn't
want
to
pay
the
money.
