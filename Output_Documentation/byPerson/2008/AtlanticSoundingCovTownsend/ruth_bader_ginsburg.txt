justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mccreadie,
in
this
case,
why
is
it
necessary
to
get
into
that,
whether
they
are
punitive
damages
under
fela
and
the
jones
act?
if
we
accept,
as
i
think
we
must,
townsend's
allegations
to
be
true,
he
has
said
that
atlantic,
as
a
matter
of
routine,
puts
in
a
boilerplate
complaint
for
declaratory
relief,
reciting
all
the
reasons
why
somebody
could
not
get
maintenance
and
cure,
even
though
that
is
patently
false,
the
allegation,
for
example,
that
he
deserted
his
post.
he
says
it's
false.
he
says
the
allegation
that
he
falsified
his
application
for
employment
is
false.
accepting
the
--
that
to
be
true
at
this
stage,
isn't
there
some
kind
of
punitive
measure
to
be
taken
against
a
litigant
who
abuses
the
court
process
in
that
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
--
but
now
we're
at
the
pretrial
stage,
and
we're
supposed
to
assume
the
truth
of
the
allegations
in
townsend's
complaint.
we're
assuming
--
they
may
well
turn
out
to
be
false;
but
at
the
threshold
under
12(b)6
we
accept
those
allegations
as
true
and
then
determine
whether
a
claim
is
stated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
let's
take
this
out
of
the
maintenance
and
cure
spot
altogether.
litigation
generally,
if
a
court
determines
that
a
litigant
is
abusing
the
court's
process
by
filing
false
pleadings,
is
there
a
remedy;
and
if
so,
what
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
all
that
was
at
stake
there
was
whether
the
employer
wrongfully
withheld
maintenance
and
cure
that
was
owing.
the
allegations
made
by
townsend
go
far
beyond
that
they
just
unreasonably
denied
him
maintenance
and
cure.
they
suggest
that
this
litigant,
as
a
matter
practice,
standard
operating
procedure,
makes
false
claims
before
a
court.
and
my
question
to
you
is,
isn't
across
the
board
there
a
sanction,
wholly
apart
from
the
particular
claim,
for
a
litigant
who
abuses
the
court's
processes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
said
never
in
the
history.
i
mean,
there
--
there
are
examples
like
the
ancient
nancy
case,
where
the
damages,
where
they
were
called
exemplary
--
but
when
you
say
never
has
there
been
before
or
after
punitive
awards.
but
there
--
there
is
precedent,
the
nancy
case
in
this
court,
cases
in
lower
courts,
there
have
been
punitive
damages
awards
in
--
in
maintenance
and
cure
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
this
court
ever
hold
that
under
fela
or
under
the
jones
act
there
are
no
punitive
damages?
do
we
--
do
we
have
any
holding
to
that
effect?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mccreadie,
there's
a
question
about
this
case,
a
troublesome
feature
of
it.
that
is,
you
are
saying
because
there
are
no
punitive
damages
available
under
fela
and
under
the
jones
act,
then
there
certainly
should
not
be
any
under
maintenance
and
cure.
but
if
we
have
to
answer
those
questions,
whether
there
are
punitive
damages
available
under
fela
and
the
jones
act,
in
the
context
of
a
maintenance
and
cure
claim,
then
we're
deciding
a
much
larger
question
than
are
punitive
damages
available
for
willful
refusal
to
pay
maintenance
and
cure.
we're
deciding
a
question
under
the
jones
act,
a
question
under
the
fela,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
would
be
interested
--
and
the
seamen
are
a
sizable
group
that
the
law
cares
about
particularly
--
but
there
would
be
a
larger
interest,
a
larger
interest
in
the
answer
in
the
jones
act
context
and
fela.
and
to
decide
those
questions
in
a
case
that
doesn't
present
any
claim
under
fela
or
any
claim
under
the
jones
act
is
troublesome.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
there
was
--
it
was
on
the
high
seas.
they
had
dohsa.
at
the
time
of
moragne,
there
was
dohsa,
but
then
it
was
when
you
weren't
on
the
high
seas
that
was
the
gap.
wasn't
that
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
what
the
common
law
was.
that's
why
we
had
lord
campbell's
act.
that
was
if
you
die,
too
bad;
if
you're
injured,
you
correct
--
collect.
that
was
fixed
by
statute
on
the
high
seas,
dohsa.
because
there
was
the
gap,
there
was
no
lord
campbell's
act,
the
court
effectively
made
one
up,
right?
that's
what
it
did
in
moragne.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
of
these
seamen
who
seek
maintenance
and
cure
are
represented?
i
mean,
what
is
the
incidence
of
representation
for
maintenance
and
cure
claims
as
distinguished
from
jones
act
negligence
type
claims
with
the
--
the
possibility
of
large
recoveries
for
pain
and
suffering?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
--
the
point
you
are
making
is
that
the
recovery
under
the
jones
act
can
be
very
large,
and
the
attorney
on
a
contingent
basis
would
get
a
piece
of
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
it
would
be
swelled
by
the
pain
and
suffering
damages
which
are
not
available
in
maintenance
and
cure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
hasn't
come
before
this
court
under
fela
or
the
jones
act,
either,
the
punitive
damage
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
--
that
was
not
argued
by
anybody.
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
lower
court.
it
wasn't
a
punitive
damages
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
--
there
wouldn't
be
any
maintenance
and
cure
claim
if
the
system
worked
as
it
was
intended;
that
is,
that
if
you
have
a
sailor
who
is
injured,
the
shipowner
pays
room
and
board
and
medical
expenses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
--
are
you
then
disputing
what
your
colleague
said
about
lawyers
being
reluctant
to
take
maintenance
and
cure
claims
that
are
not
tied
with
a
jones
act
claim?
