justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
do
you
read
vaughan
v.
atkinson
as
necessarily
implying
punitive
damages
would
be
inappropriate?
i
--
i
can't
quite
find
the
negative
that
you
want
me
to
find,
i
think,
in
atkinson.
true,
they
didn't
talk
about
punitive
damages.
they
said
damages
are
appropriate,
and
attorneys'
fees
in
this
case
is
what
the
district
court
gave,
we
are
going
to
affirm
it.
but
there's
nothing
there
that
said
punitive
damages
are
inappropriate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
--
but
that
was
a
common
law
wrongful
death
action,
correct,
miles?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
was
not
admiralty
maintenance
and
cure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
--
as
i
read
your
reply
brief
--
and
please
correct
me
if
it's
a
misimpression
--
you
didn't
dispute
the
fact
that
punitive
damages
were
available
historically
for
the
shipowner's
wrongful
refusal
to
provide
maintenance
and
cure,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
about
english
admiralty,
under
the
english
precedents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
in
miles
--
again,
we're
coming
back
--
was
wrongful
death,
not
maintenance
and
cure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
just
--
and
you
can
go
ahead
and
answer
that
question
without
my
interrupting.
but
my
assumption
from
reading
the
amicus
briefs
in
this
case
is
that
punitive
damages
were
awarded
in
some
maintenance
and
cure
cases,
(a)
as
simply
part
of
the
overall
award
--
they
weren't
separated
out,
but
it
was
part
of
the
measure
--
and,
(b)
that
some
american
courts,
american
judges,
including
noted
admiralty
judges,
awarded
in
some
cases
punitive
damages
in
maintenance
and
cure
before
the
modern
cases,
moragne
and
so
forth
that
you're
--
and
miles
--
that
you're
talking
about.
is
that
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
pre-miles.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
surely
there
will
be
some
incidents
in
which
the
employer
in
good
faith
thinks
that
there's
no
illness,
that
there's
no
basis
for
maintenance
and
cure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
you
to
tell
me,
oh,
this
will
just
never
happen,
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
not
the
way
the
world
works.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
there
are
going
to
be
disputes,
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not,
just
from
the
standpoint
of
fulfilling
professional
responsibility,
in
almost
any
maintenance
and
cure
action
where
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
thinks
that
--
for
the
seaman
thinks
that
the
employer
has
been
remiss,
he
doesn't
add
the
punitive
damages
complaint,
if
we
--
if
we
agree
with
your
position,
which
changes
completely
the
settlement
and
the
bargaining
aspect.
but
you
can
address
--
you
can
address
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
thought
that
the
lack
of
counsel
in
maintenance
and
cure
cases
was
a
pivotal
point
or
a
relevant
point
for
our
decision,
other
than
the
representations
of
counsel,
where
would
i
look
to
verify
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
--
that
there
is
a
problem
in
seamen
finding
attorneys
who
will
take
maintenance
and
cure
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
a
separate
cause
of
action?
or
is
it
just
part
of
the
maintenance
and
cure
act?
