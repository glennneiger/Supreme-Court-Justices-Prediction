mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
by
answering
the
question
that
was
raised
by
justice
ginsburg.
this
court
does
not
need
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
or
not
punitive
damages
are
available
under
the
jones
act
or
under
the
fela
in
order
to
decide
this
issue,
because
maintenance
and
cure
is
different.
it
precedes
the
jones
act
by
centuries,
perhaps
even
a
thousand
years,
and
it
deals
with
a
distinctly
different
problem.
maintenance
and
cure
deals
with
a
situation
as
what
do
we
do
with
an
injured
seaman
to
get
him
back
to
health
and
get
him
into
the
workforce?
and
the
law
has
provided
since
catherine
of
aragon
went
to
greece
in
the
1200s
that
the
shipowner
has
a
responsibility,
in
its
capacity
as
a
shipowner,
to
provide
that
seaman
with
medical
care
and
to
provide
that
seaman
with
a
living
allowance
so
that
he
can
get
better
and
get
back
into
the
work
force.
now,
in
1920,
senator
jones
intended
to
make
the
united
states
merchant
marine
the
world's
greatest
merchant
marine.
he
was
dealing
in
a
factual
scenario
where
12
years
earlier,
on
april
12th
of
1912,
the
titanic
had
sunk;
1,900
people
had
died.
virtually
every
member
of
the
senate
and
congress
knew
somebody
who
was
on
the
titanic,
and
during
the
intervening
eight
years,
certain
points
of
law
became
obvious.
first
of
all,
the
people
who
died
on
the
titanic
could
not
recover
for
anything
except
their
lost
baggage.
they
could
not
recover
for
the
fact
that
their
loved
ones
had
passed
away,
because
there
was
no
cause
of
action.
secondly,
because
the
titanic
hit
an
iceberg
and
was
not
unseaworthy,
there
was
no
cause
of
action
for
negligence.
so
senator
jones
set
around
to
correct
these
two
anomalies
in
the
law,
and
said
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
we're
going
to
create
a
new
class
of
beneficiaries,
who
are
dependents
of
people
who
die
at
sea,
and
we
are
going
to
give
them
the
right
to
recover
pecuniary
damages.
that's
the
only
place
where
pecuniary
damages
are
mentioned
in
the
law.
and
then
it
said,
and
as
to
seamen,
we're
going
to
give
them
an
additional
right,
a
cumulative
right
on
top
of
unseaworthiness,
and
that's
going
to
be
negligence.
it
never
sought
out
to
touch
maintenance
and
cure.
maintenance
and
cure
has
been
something
that's
been
monitored
by
the
courts
ever
since
its
inception,
and
it
is
a
self-regulating
system.
before
guevara,
shipowners
regularly
provided
their
employees
with
medical
care
without
asking
the
question.
if
there
was
a
close
call,
they
provided
the
medical
care
without
running
to
the
court.
they
provided
maintenance.
then
came
guevara,
and
guevara
decided
for
the
first
time
there
were
no
punitive
damages,
and
now
you
have
a
growing
problem
in
this
country.
you
have
a
problem
with
shipowners
providing
less
and
less
medical
care
without
resort
to
the
courts.
now,
our
position
here
is
that
a
seaman
should
be
not
ever
have
to
come
before
a
court
to
seek
maintenance
and
cure,
and
the
court
should
never,
ever
have
to
award
punitive
damages.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
and
absolute--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--no.
and,
judge,
when
a
--
when
an
employer
comes
to
the
court
in
good
faith
and
says
there's
no
entitlement
to
maintenance
and
cure,
and
there
--
the
court
finds
that
--
or
the
finder
of
facts
finds
there's
good
faith,
there's
no
basis
for
punitive
damages.
then
you
merely
have
a
dispute.
but
the
situation--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--well
--
and
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
is
a
prospect
and
a
possibility,
something
which
i
personally
abhor
doing.
i
mean,
you
should
only
plead
punitive
damages
when
you
have
a
good
faith
basis
for
doing
it;
you
believe
you
will
survive
a
directed
verdict.
it
should
not
be
thrown
in
to
every
single
complaint,
and
i'm
not
denying
that
some
counsel
will
do
that.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
today,
in
2009,
in
2006,
there
are
actually
shipowners
who
are,
as
a
regular
practice,
denying
their
seamen
medical
care.
i
don't
know
why
that
is.
perhaps
it's
because
it
is
expensive
now,
more
expensive
than
it
has
ever
been.
perhaps
it
is
because
there
are
safety
nets
that
will
allow
the
seamen
to
seek
medicaid,
and
so
the
taxpayer
will
pay
for
it.
whatever
the
motivations
are,
it
is
a
growing
trend
that
we
are
seeing.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
judge,
i'd
be
picking
a
number
out
of
the
air,
but
i
can
give
you
anecdotal
evidence
of
this.
in
the
fifth
circuit
attorneys
who
regularly
do
maritime
personal
injury
work
tell
each
other
--
we
talk
about
the
fact
that
you
can't
afford
to
represent
somebody
who's
got
a
maintenance
and
cure
case
that's
not
combined
with
a
jones
act
case.
and
there
are
a
number
of
practical
reasons
for
that.
you
have
to
pay
all
the
experts,
and
it
is
very
expensive
to
bring
these
cases.
you
have
to
hire
the
orthopedic
surgeons,
the
--
the
radiologists.
you
have
to
pay
for
the
tests.
and
then,
as
an
attorney,
these
are
never
recoverable
as
costs.
and
then
you
are
working
on
a
contingent
hourly
fee.
if
you
win
your
case
and
you
prove
that
they
were
willful,
wanton
and
callous
in
--
in
denying
maintenance
and
cure,
then
you
might
get
a
portion
of
your
attorneys'
fees
back.
now,
you
may
do
that
as
a
pro
bono
matter
on
occasion.
but
you
cannot
rely
upon
the
fact
that
attorneys
will
take
these
cases.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
well,
because
when
you
join
it
to
a
jones
act
case,
you
have
the
substantial
possibility
of
getting
either
a
settlement
or
a
verdict
at
the
end
of
the
case
which
is
going
to
compensate
the
attorneys
for
taking
on
the
maintenance
and
cure
case
as
a
portion
of
it.
and
so,
consequently,
if
somebody
has
a
serious
accident,
it
falls
under
the
jones
act
and
there
is
a
maintenance
and
cure
count,
the
attorney
will
handle
all
of
those
together
and
feel
adequately
compensated.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
judge,
first
of
all,
i
would
cite
to
you
two
cases:
the
rolf
case,
which
is
a
1924
ninth
circuit
case--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--no.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
this
issue
did
not
come
before
this
court.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
it
hasn't
--
it
has
not,
your
honor.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
we
don't,
but
we
know
that
there
was
outrage
on
behalf
of
the
court.
and,
unfortunately,
in
--
and
i
think,
as
justice
souter
pointed
out--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--well,
judge,
i
would
say
that--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--yes.
i
would
say
that
the
best
are
the
rolf
and
the
margharita,
which
were
denials
of
medical
care
where
the
damages
were
enhanced
because
of
outrageous
conduct.
but
to
say
that,
judge,
is
there
a
case
that
says
this
is
maintenance
and
cure,
we
are
going
to
award
punitive
damages,
that's
not
been
done.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
judge--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--well,
let
me
--
let
me
respond
to
that
in
a
couple
of
ways.
first
of
all,
punitive
damages
were
part
of
the
common
law
until
taken
away
by
congress.
and
--
and
it
could
be
asserted
that
maintenance
and
cure
punitive
damages
were
not
necessary
because
the
threat
was
enough
to
--
to
require
shipowners
to
go
ahead
and
provide
this.
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
had
not
been
a
problem
prior
to
guevara.
shipowners
did
self-regulate.
they
didn't
--
seamen
didn't
run
to
the
courts
every
time
they
wanted
maintenance
and
cure;
whereas,
today
they
have
to.
the
leading
scholar
in
this
whole
area
is
professor
robertson
at
the
university
of
texas
who
wrote
the
aha
brief.
and
his
brief,
on
pages
7
through
11,
catalogs
the
cases
where
he
suggests
punitive
damages
or
exemplary
damages
were
awarded
for
outrageous
conduct
involving
failure
to
provide
medical
care.
and
i
would
suggest
that
those
show
that
punitive
damages
were
unexceptional
before
vaughan.
they
were
part
of
the
common
law.
they
--
they
were
before
this
court
in
the
amiable
nancy,
even
though
it
didn't
involve
medical
care.
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
if
punitive
damages
are
accepted
in
maritime
law
as
part
of
the
common
law,
that
they
weren't
also
accepted
for
the
willful,
wanton,
egregious
failure
to
provide
a
seaman
with
medical
care.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
the
existence
of
prior
maintenance
and
cure
cases?
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
yes,
judge,
there
is
not
empirical
evidence
out
there.
nobody
has
done
studies.
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
but
do
we
really
want
to
wait
for
the
situation
where
we
have
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
seamen
who
are
--
are,
you
know,
living
homeless
or
living
in
their
cars
or
unable
to
obtain
medical
care
before
this
court
decides
that
if
somebody
does
this,
it
is
something
that
can
be
punished?
and
--
and
i
think
that's
the
situation
we're
at
today.
it
is
a
growing
problem.
and
it
is
a
growing
problem
because
guevara
is
a
relatively
new
case,
and
it
has
spread
to
the
other
circuits.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
well,
it
does
come
up
in
the
vaughan
dissent
because
it
was
not
requested
by
the
low
--
in
the
--
in
the
lower
courts.
and
this
court
would
not
consider
a
claim
for
punitive
damages
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
i
--
i
think
what
justice
stewart
was
saying
is
we
have
a
question
before
--
before
us
where
somebody
is
requesting
attorneys'
fees
in
--
in
derogation
of
the
american
rule.
the
majority
is
saying
we
are
going
to
find
an
exception
to
the
american
rule
and
give
attorneys'
fees.
and
justice
stewart
is
saying,
i
don't
want
to
do
that.
i
think
that
the
better--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--i'm
sorry?
was
he
more--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--no,
i
--
i
think--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--no.
no.
i--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--he
was
quoting
from
mccormick
on
damages
and
some
basic
treatises.
and
i
think
he
was
taking
the
position
that
punitive
damages
are
in
our
quiver
of
weapons
that
we
can
use
to
deter--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
he
was
saying
that
this
is
one
of
the
weapons
we
have.
instead
of
creating
an
exception
to
the
american
rule,
we
ought
to
just
give
them
punitive
damages
to
account
for
this
egregious
conduct.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
no,
it
wasn't.
it
wasn't.
the
first
time
counsel
for
mr.
vaughan
raised
the
question
of
punitive
damages
was
on
remand.
and
then
the
district
court
said,
hey,
look,
you
didn't
raise
it
before.
just
because
justice
stewart
suggested
this
is
a
--
as
a
--
as
an
alternative
to
attorneys'
fees
doesn't
mean
we're
going
to
award
punitive
damages
now.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
judge,
i
would
like
you
to
look
at
how
congress
treats
this
problem.
if
you
had,
for
example,
a
bridge-building
project
where
a
seaman,
a
longshoreman
and
a
state
worker
all
got
injured
identically
in
the
same
accident
side
by
side,
and
the
shipowner
failed
to
provide
medical
care
for
the
longshoreman,
the
shipowner
could
go
to
jail.
if
the
shipowner
provided
--
or
failed
to
provide
medical
care
to
the
state
worker,
he
could
be,
again,
subject
to
criminal
penalties.
on
top
of
the
criminal
penalties,
congress
has
established
these
administrative
agencies
to
assure
that
those
workers
get
medical
care.
on
top
of
that,
if
they
don't
get
medical
care,
they
lose
their
defense
of
workers'
compensation
immunity.
they
lose
the
defense
of
assumption
of
risk,
contributory
negligence,
and
they
are
subject
to
personal
liability,
not
just
corporate
liability.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
yes.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
that--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
what
i
think
he
would
be
saying
is
this
is
part
of
our
power
as
a
common
law
court.
and
just
because
we
haven't--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--well--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--yes.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
judge,
i--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--i
would
--
i
would
hope
that
would
not
be
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
invited,
judge.
there
are
reasons
why
that
there
is
this
anomaly
that
there
are
no
punitive
damages
for
death.
and
that's
because
in
1920
when
congress
created
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
there
were
no
--
any
kind
of
damages.
there
was
no
recovery
at
all.
and
so,
congress
preempted
this
field
of
death.
and
it
said
that
death
cases
shall
be
decided
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
but
congress
has
completely
stayed
away
from
the
area
of
maintenance
and
cure.
it
hasn't
enacted
administrative
remedies
because
the
court
has
always
been
the
one
who
has
decided
what's
appropriate.
and
this
court,
as
a
matter
of
its
--
as
maintaining
its
court
docket
and
maintaining
these
remedies,
has
the
right
and
i
think
the
obligation
to
say
we're
going
to
keep
these
cases
out
of
court
by
awarding
punitive
damages
when
somebody
willfully
denies
this
right,
when
somebody
willfully
withholds
medical
care.
and
i
think
if
you
do
that,
you're
going
to
see
these
cases
are
going
to
disappear.
seamen
are
going
to
start
getting
their
medical
care
again.
they
are
not
going
to
be
coming
to
the
court
every
time
they
get
injured
and
saying,
i
haven't
gotten
my
back
surgery.
i
haven't
gotten
my
rotator
cuff
surgery.
and
it
is
sort
of
a
matter
of
court
administration
to
--
to--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--this
is
a
very
narrow
area
of
law,
your
honor.
we
are
talking
about
are
you
giving
the
seaman
the
medical
care
he
needs
to
get
the
maximum
medical
improvement?
and
that's
all
it
is.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
i
think
this
would
be
different
because
all
we're
talking
about
is
does
the
seaman
get
the
surgery
he
needs.
if
he
doesn't
get
the
surgery
he
needs
and
he
gets
worse
or
he
continues
to
stay
ill
or
he
continues
to
stay
in
pain,
then
the
shipowner
should
be
punished.
but--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--the
goal
here,
judge,
is
not
money.
the
goal
here,
i
think--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--i
think
it
would
decrease
the
incidence
when
--
when
medical
care
is
denied.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
that's
all
it
is,
your
honor.
just
say
if
the
--
if
the
shipowner
will
treat
the
seaman
fairly,
will
follow
the
doctor's
recommendations,
get
him
to
a
doctor,
give
him
treatment
so
he
gets
better,
there's
--
i
mean,
you
are
saying
there
may
be
more
claims
for
punitive
damages,
but
there
will
be
more
awards
of
punitive
damages
because
there
won't
be
this
willful
and
wanton,
callous
disregard
of
the
seaman's
rights.
and
so,
i
would
suggest
that,
in
fact,
in
this
narrow
area
of
the
law,
if
you
impose
punitive
damages,
actual
punitive
conduct,
conduct
that
deserves
punishment
will
go
down
and
it
will
go
down
rapidly.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
judge.
i
think
those
kind
of
cases
should
be
weeded
out
on
summary
judgment
by
the
courts
--
by
the
district
court,
because
we're
only
talking
about
the
willful,
wanton
and
callous
withholding--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--and
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
--
the
district
courts
are
going
to
have
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
the
bona
fides
of
that
case.
but
i
think
that
you
are
going
to
find
that
it
is
very
rare
when
somebody
is
going
to
act
callously
when
the
potential
on
the
other
side
is
that
they
are
going
to
be
awarded
--
have
punitive
damages
awarded
against
them.
and
that,
therefore,
this
is
going
to
be
a
corrective
mechanism
that's
going
to
do
away
with
the
problem
we
currently
have
now
and
make
the
plaintiffs
even
better.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
if
the
punitive
damages
are
but
the
hope,
of
course,
is
that--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--it's
going
to
err
on
behalf
of
the
seaman.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
yes.
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
that's
true,
judge.
but
here
again,
we're
balancing
the
interest
of
somebody
who
is
injured
and
whose
condition
may
become
permanent
and
incurable
by
virtue
of
not
getting
prompt
care
as
opposed
to
the
limited
costs
to
the
shipowner
of
--
of
providing
a
doctor
who
is
going
to
determine
what
the
best
care
is.
and
that's
all
we
asking
for,
is
the
best
care
that
medical
care
can
currently
provide
to
get
the
seaman
to
maximum
cure.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
gj
rod
sullivan
jr.
--thank
you,
your
honor.
