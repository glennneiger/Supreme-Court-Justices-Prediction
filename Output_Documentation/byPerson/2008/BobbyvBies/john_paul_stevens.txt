justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
right
there,
mr.
mizer?
is
it
fair
to
interpret
the
jury's
decision
to
impose
the
death
penalty
as
having
found
that
he
was
not
mentally
retarded
and
therefore
was
not
a
mitigating
factor,
or
that
even
though
he
was
--
a
mitigating
factor,
the
aggravating
factors
outweighed
that
factor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
there
some
testimony
that
one
test
was
only
50?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mizer,
can
i
just
get
one
clarifying
question?
the
concession
at
page
160
of
the
record,
"the
record
reveals
the
defendant
to
be
mildly
retarded
with
an
iq
of
about
69.
"
and
then
they
argue
as
a
matter
of
law
that
he
cannot
be
--
he
may
be
punished.
is
it
your
position
that
the
further
proceeding
in
the
ohio
trial
court,
that
the
state
intends
to
argue
that
a
person
who
is
mentally
retarded
with
an
iq
of
about
69
may
be
executed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you'll
offer
evidence
to
show
that
statement
is
inaccurate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
the
--
could
well
be
different.
but
is
it
ohio's
intent
to
disagree
with
that
statement
insofar
as
it
recites
facts?
that
the
record
reveals
the
defendant
to
be
mildly
mentally
retarded
with
an
iq
of
about
69?
i
understand
you
will
argue
that
that's
not
sufficient
to
--
to
come
within
atkins.
but
do
you
intend
to
say
--
to
challenge
the
accuracy
of
that
factual
statement?
