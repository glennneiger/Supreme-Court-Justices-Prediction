roberts,

we
will
hear
argument
next
in
bobby
versus
bies.
mr.
mizer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
blume.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
far
--
how
far
down
do
you
go
on
applying
the
issue
preclusion?
let's
say
there's
a
ruling
by
the
court
that
a
particular
expert
was
not
credible.
i
mean,
is
that
binding
in
a
subsequent
proceeding?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
narrowing
it
to
your
particular
context.
i
would
have
assumed
that
the
theory
has
to
be
more
generally
applicable,
and
not
just
applicable
in
the
particular
atkins
context.
if
you
can
have
issue
preclusion
with
respect
to
an
underlying
factual
question
under
which
the
loser
can
assert
that,
i
don't
see
why
it
wouldn't
apply
more
generally.
that's
a
theory
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
not
of
atkins.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
this
strikes
me
as
the
sort
of
case
where
their
incentives
might
well
be
different,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested.
if
you're
dealing
with
a
borderline
case,
you
don't
--
and
you
think
you
have
very
compelling
aggravating
factors,
you
know,
why
call
attention
to
the
--
the
mitigating
factor
of
the
mental
condition
when
your
case
can
be
won
on
the
others?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
mizer,
you
have
ten
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
08-598,
bobby
verus
bies.
