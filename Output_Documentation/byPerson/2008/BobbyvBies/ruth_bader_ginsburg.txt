justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
all
agreed
that
he
was
mentally
retarded,
and
that
was
a
mitigator.
they
all
agreed
to
that.
but
assuming
you're
right
on
issue
preclusion,
what
more
--
the
state
says,
yes,
we
recognize
"mental
retardation"
means
you
can't
administer
the
death
penalty.
but
what
would
the
state
show
at
an
atkins
hearing
that
is
not
already
in
the
record
of
this
case?
i
mean
why
do
it
again?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
how
it
worked
pre-atkins
when
mental
retardation
was
a
mitigator?
we
are
told
that
the
appellate
courts
independently
reviewed.
we
have
a
finding
at
the
trial
level
that,
yes,
there
is
a
mitigator
mental
retardation,
but
it
doesn't
overcome
the
aggravator,
so
the
jury
comes
in
with
a
death
sentence.
then
at
the
appellate
level,
is
there
a
continuing
adversary
contest
about
whether
retardation
exists
and,
therefore,
is
a
mitigator,
or
is
it
just
the
--
the
judge,
the
appellate
judge,
looking
over
the
record
that
has
been
made
at
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
--
so
that
the
prosecutor
could
still
argue
that
was
unreasonable
for
them
to
find
mental
retardation,
so
there
shouldn't
be
that
mitigator?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
they
didn't
make
a
finding
on
mental
retardation,
how
--
how
could
the
appellate
court
determine
that
it
was
a
mitigator
but
overwhelmed
by
the
aggravating
--
what
did
the
judge
charge
the
jury
about
mitigators
and
aggravators?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
first
go
back
to
the
jury.
how
do
we
know
that
the
jury
found
mental
retardation
as
a
mitigator?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
acting
years
before
atkins.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
--
wasn't
the
ohio
supreme
court
decision
in
this
case
pre-atkins?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
was
dealing
with
retardation
as
a
mitigator,
not
retardation
as
conclusive
that
there
can
be
no
death
penalty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
before
you
get
to
whether
--
anything
like
that,
you
are
urging
issue
preclusion
against
the
winner.
it
was
a
death
sentence
in
this
case.
and
i
am
not
aware
of
issue
preclusion
operating
against
a
judgment
winner.
issue
preclusion
is
for
the
party
who
fought
this
out
and
won.
here
we
have
a
death
sentence.
so
there
--
the
ultimate
determination,
whatever
intermediate
determinations
might
have
been
made
on
the
way,
like
mental
retardation
exists
and
was
a
mitigator,
the
ultimate
judgment
is
death.
and
i
am
not
aware
of,
in
all
of
issue
preclusion,
where
a
judgment
winner
is
precluded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
question
is
what
is
the
issue,
and
an
intermediate
finding,
say
mitigation,
on
the
way
to
the
ultimate
conclusion,
life
or
death,
is
not
the
same
issue
as
if
retardation
is
found,
no
death
penalty.
it's
--
it's
the
ultimate
issue
in
the
case
that
was
before
the
ohio
supreme
court
is,
do
the
aggravators
outweigh
the
mitigators?
that's
the
ultimate
determination,
and
that's
what
would
have
preclusive
effect,
not
the
many
intermediate
findings
that
may
have
been
made
on
the
way
to
the
ultimate
determination
of
death.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
say
you
have
--
you
don't
find
that
in
the
cases
when
you
said
to
me,
and
i
think
frankly
you
were
right,
that
issue
preclusion
--
and
there
are
many,
many
cases
on
issue
preclusion
--
is
something
that
a
judgment
winner
uses,
not
a
judgment
loser,
and
here
the
ohio
--
yes,
they
weighed
and
they
found
retardation,
but
they
also
found
overwhelmed
by
the
aggravating
circumstances.
so
the
ultimate
determination
of
that,
of
all
the
courts,
is
death?
i
don't
see
how
you
get
to
elevate
an
intermediate
determination
--
there
are
many;
some
go
for
one
party,
some
go
for
the
other
--
to
become
the
outcome
determinative
factor.
the
outcome
determinative
factor
is
that
the
aggregators
outweighed
whatever
mitigators
there
were.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
ashe
is
about
somebody
who
was
acquitted.
he
won.
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
won.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
didn't
say
anything
about,
well,
suppose
he
didn't
win.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
have
the
factor
that
you
would
preclude
ohio
from
doing,
when
we
expressly
said
that
here
is
the
rule:
you
can't
execute
the
mentally
retarded.
however,
we
are
going
to
leave
it
to
the
state
to
shape
the
procedure,
and
what
are
the
elements
of
retardation?
you
would
take
all
that
away
from
ohio
because
in
a
different
context,
the
context
of
weighing
mitigators
against
aggravators,
the
ohio
supreme
court
said
there
was
retardation,
it
is
mitigating;
however,
it
was
overwhelmed
by
the
aggravators.
it's
an
entirely
different
operation
than,
states,
here's
the
rule;
the
procedure
for
doing
it
is
up
to
you.
ohio
didn't
have
a
procedure
for
doing
atkins.
it
couldn't
until
atkins
was
decided.
and
now
you're
saying,
oh,
ohio,
because
you,
in
the
context
of
weighing
mitigators
against
aggravators,
found
this
mitigator,
you
cannot
shape
the
atkins
procedure
as
every
other
state
can.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
incentive
is
vastly
different,
which
is
an
important
factor
in
issue
preclusion.
that
is,
if
the
prosecutor
thinks
that
there's
overwhelming
evidence
of
the
aggravators,
the
nature
of
the
crime,
the
prosecutor
is
not
going
to
care
so
much
about,
so
there
is
mental
retardation
as
a
mitigator;
but
when
it's
a
difference,
when
the
prosecutor
wants
to
go
for
the
death
penalty
and
it
thinks
that
it's
got
a
secure
case
on
the
atrocious
matter
in
which
the
crime
was
committed,
there
isn't
the
same
incentive
to
litigate
as
there
is
when
it
is
the
ultimate
question,
not
an
issue
on
the
way
to
reaching
the
ultimate
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
they
admit
that
as
a
finding
of
fact,
or
did
they
say
that
mental
retardation
had
been
found
as
a
mitigator
by
the
ohio
supreme
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
an
admission;
it
couldn't
have
been
a
finding
of
fact.
you
said
that
that's
what
the
state
claimed.
where
is
the
admission
of
the
state
in
this
state
postconviction
proceeding
that
mr.
bies
is
mentally
retarded?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
told
me
that
this
--
that
state
conceded
that
the
defendant
was
mentally
retarded,
and
i'm
--
that's
what
i
asked
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
very
next
sentence
is
as
a
matter
of
law
--
the
law
as
it
was
then
--
such
a
person
may
be
punished
by
execution.
so,
again,
it's
--
the
stakes
are
quite
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
must
have
been,
the
page
you
called
my
attention
to
must
have
been
pre-atkins.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
no,
we're
back
--
what
you
called
my
attention
to
was
pre-atkins.
it
was
the
application
made
to
the
state
court
before
atkins
which
put
two
sentences
together.
one
was
the
record
reveals
defendant
to
be
mildly
mentally
retarded
with
an
iq
of
about
69.
as
a
matter
of
law,
such
a
person
may
be
punished
by
execution.
this
is
all
pre-atkins.
so
one
statement
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
what
was
its
significance,
and
it
wasn't
the
conclusive
factor
at
the
time
of
that
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
since
atkins,
we're
talking
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
atkins
v.
virginia,
decided
in
2002,
this
court
held
that
the
eighth
amendment
bars
execution
of
mentally
retarded
offenders.
under
our
pre-atkins
precedent,
mental
retardation,
narrative
consideration
as
a
mitigating
factor
but
did
not
bar
in
position
of
the
death
penalty.
nearly,
a
decade
before
atkins,
respondent
michael
bies
was
tried
and
convicted
in
ohio
of
the
aggravated
murder,
kidnapping
and
attempted
rape
of
a
10-year-old
boy.
at
the
sentencing
stage,
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury
to
weigh
mitigating
circumstances
including
evidence
of
bies'
mile
to
borderline
mental
retardation
against
aggravating
circumstances
including
the
crime's
brutality.
the
jury
recommended
a
death
sentence
which
the
trial
court
imposed.
ohio's
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
affirmed,
each
concluding
that
bies'
mental
retardation
was
entitled
to
someway
in
litigation,
but
that
the
aggravators
outweighed
the
mitigators.
after
this
court
decided
atkins,
bies
sought
state
post
conviction
relief
and
the
court
ordered
a
full
hearing
on
bies'
mental
capacity.
rather
than
proceeding
with
that
hearing,
bies
filed
a
federal
habeas
petition
in
u.s.
district
court,
contending
that
the
fifth
amendments'
double
jeopardy
clause
barred
the
state
from
re-litigating
the
issue
of
his
mental
retardation.
the
district
court
granted
the
habeas
petition
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
the
sixth
circuit
identified
as
the
controlling
precedent
this
court's
decision
in
ashe
v.
swenson.
we
held
in
ashe
that
the
doctrine
of
issue
preclusion
is
a
component
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
issue
preclusion
was
dispositive
of
bies'
case
as
sixth
circuit
believed
of
critical
importance
to
its
decision,
the
sixth
circuit
found
necessary
to
the
death
penalty
sentence.
the
ohio
court's
recognition
that
bies
is
qualified
as
mentally
retarded.
we
reverse
and
note
first
that
bies
was
not
twice
put
in
jeopardy.
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death
and
ohio
sought
no
further
prosecution
or
punishment
rather,
rather
than
successive
efforts
to
prosecute
or
punish
him,
this
case
involves
successive
efforts
by
bies
to
overturn
his
capital
sentence.
the
doctrine
of
issue
preclusion
on
which
the
sixth
circuit
relied,
bars
litigation
of
issues
actually
determined
and
necessary
to
the
ultimate
outcome
of
a
prior
proceeding.
the
federal
court
of
appeals
held
that
all
requirements
with
issue
preclusion
were
met
in
bies'
case.
that
holding
was
in
correct
because
mental
retardation
was
not
a
conclusive
or
necessary
determination
in
any
ohio
court
proceeding
to
date.
the
determination
ranks
as
necessary,
only
when
the
final
outcome
hinges
on
it.
statements
made
by
the
ohio
courts
regarding
bies'
mental
capacity,
plainly
worth
not
necessary
to
the
final
outcome
that
is
the
judgment
affirming
his
death
sentence.
further,
even
if
court
issue
preclusion
requirements
had
been
met,
an
exemption
to
the
doctrine's
application
would
be
warranted
due
to
the
intervening
atkins
decision.
that
change
in
law
substantially
alters
the
state's
incentive
to
contest
bies'
mental
capacity.
under
atkins,
mental
retardation
bars
a
death
sentence.
when
bies
was
tried
however,
retardation
was
only
a
mitigator,
moreover
of
retardation
play,
pre-atkins
could
backfire.
the
prosecutor
could
seize
an
evidence
of
the
defendant's
diminished
capacity
to
urge
the
defendant's
dangerousness
to
others,
rendering
death,
not
like
the
appropriate
sentence.
in
short,
the
question
whether
bies
qualifies
under
atkins
as
a
mentally
retarded
person,
ineligible
for
the
death
penalty
is
now
right
for
a
foreign
fair
determination
in
state
court.
our
decision
corrects
the
federal
court's
errors
in
temporarily
derailing
that
determination,
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
