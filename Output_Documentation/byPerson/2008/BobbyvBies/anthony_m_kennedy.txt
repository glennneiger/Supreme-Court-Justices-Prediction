i
don't
want
to
take
you
too
far
outside
the
record,
and
you
can
come
back
to
it,
but
i
--
i
just
have
this
question.
suppose
that
in
a
jury
case
the
jury
--
pre-atkins,
the
jury
says,
we
find
that
the
defendant
has
a
65
iq,
but
that
in
light
of
the
heinous
nature
of
the
offense,
this
is
not
a
mitigating
factor,
and
that
he
should
be
sentenced
to
death.
in
a
subsequent
atkins
proceeding,
can
the
jury
finding
with
reference
to
the
iq
be
conclusive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
must
that
be
reopened?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
can
--
can
be
reopened?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
could
the
--
could
the
defendant
argue
the
--
that
--
the
accused
argue
that
at
least
as
to
the
finding
of
the
65
iq,
that
that
is
a
given.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
that
issue,
i.e.,
the
level
of
iq,
cannot
be
relitigated,
the
number?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
--
let
me
just
ask,
does
the
state
have
any
position
now
as
to
his
iq?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
will
the
state
--
would
you
say
the
state
has
an
independent
obligation
to
--
to
ensure
itself
that
he
has
an
adequate
iq?
