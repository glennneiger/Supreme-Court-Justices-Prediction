justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
you
say
65
iq?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
i
grant
you
that
under
--
under
the
earlier
case
the
65
iq
was
not
dispositive,
and
i
mean
that
was
the
--
the
case
in
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical.
but
it
was
necessary
under
the
early
case
to
come
to
a
determination
of
what
the
iq
was,
even
though
that
determination
was
not
dispositive
of
the
result.
and
because
it
was
necessary
to
come
to
a
determination,
why
shouldn't
there
be
a
preclusion?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
wasn't
necessary
to
reach
that
particular
--
in
other
words,
the
determination
of
65
was
not
necessary
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
they
reached.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
--
you
are
saying
the
very
fact
that
it
was
not
dispositive
of
the
result
means
that
it
cannot
be
preclusive
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
even
--
even
if
that's
so,
that's
not
necessarily
an
--
an
atkins
finding,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
atkin
--
atkin
--
we
didn't
determine
what
the
definition
of
retardation
was.
we
--
we
operated
in
atkins
on
a
broad
conception
of
retardation
and
we
came
down
with
a
general
rule.
but
we
left
it
for
later
litigation,
starting
in
the
states,
to
determine
exactly
how
that
line
ought
to
be
drawn.
we
didn't
know
where
the
line
ought
to
be
drawn
at
that
point
and
certainly
the
clinical
psychologists
didn't
know,
regardless
of
what
the
--
what
definition
was
being
used.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
--
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
i
don't
see
why
it
makes
any
difference
which
court
is
doing
what.
she
--
she
raised
two
objections.
number
one
is
that
so
far
as
the
issue
being
determined
in
the
prior
proceeding,
the
characterization
of
his
mental
state
as
retardation
was
at
most
a
subsidiary,
not
an
ultimate
fact.
number
two,
the
conclusion
of
that
prior
proceeding
was
that
he
lost.
and
she's
saying
in
those,
in
either
of
those
circumstances,
the
subsidiary
finding
is
not
preclusive
and
any
finding
is
not
preclusive
in
the
manner
in
which
he
wishes
to
use
it
here.
i
don't
see
what
difference
it
makes
whether
we're
talking
about
court
a
or
court
b.
what
is
--
what
is
your
response
to
those
two
objections?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
--
if
the
ohio
court
had
found,
the
court
of
first
instance
had
found,
that
the
iq
was
at
some
different
level,
it
could
have
come
out
exactly
the
same
way
it
came
out
in
this
case,
couldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
finding
was
not
necessary
to
the
result?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
we
went
through
this
with
your
brother,
and
he
pointed
out,
yes,
it
was
necessary
to
--
to
consider
the
issue
and
to
make
some
kind
of
a
finding
--
i
don't
know
how
precise
it
had
to
be
--
but
the
finding
that
it
made,
the
--
the
actual
number
that
was
used
or
the
characterization
that
was
used
to
describe
that
number
was
not
necessary
in
order,
in
fact,
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
--
and
the
sense
of
necessity
which
is
used
normally
in
--
in
this
kind
of
preclusion
analysis
just
doesn't
apply
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
that
is
the
argument,
then
what
is
being
preclusive
here
is
not
the
first
judgment.
i
mean,
in
preclusion
cases
it's
the
first
judgment
that
precludes,
and
we
identify
a
judgment
which
is
preclusive
in
the
way
we've
been
describing.
but
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
breyer
gave
you,
there's
nothing
preclusive
about
the
first
judgment
because
the
first
judgment
stands
and
properly
can
stand.
and
you're
saying
there
can't
be
a
second
judgment,
but
you
are
not
depending
upon
a
rule
of
preclusion
that
turns
on
the
first.
so
whatever
your
argument
is,
it's
not
--
it's
not
issue
preclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
you're
coming
up
with
a
brand
new
rule.
whatever
your
rule
is,
it's
not
a
rule
of
double
jeopardy
and
it's
not
--
it's
not
the
traditional
rule
of
issue
preclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
what
your
rule
is,
as
i
understand
it
in
your
response
to
justice
breyer's
question,
is
if
there
was
a
subsidiary
fact
determination
in
the
first
case,
even
though
it
was
entirely
consistent
with
the
judgment
against
your
client,
that's
subsidiary
fact
determination
can
be
used
as
a
defense
by
your
client
in
the
second
case.
that's
your
rule,
as
i
understand
it,
and
that
is
not
the
rule
of
ashe
v.
swenson
and
it
is
not
the
rule
of
issue
preclusion.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
--
do
you
agree
with
me
that
you're
asking
for
a
brand-new
rule
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
have
never
held
this,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
court
that's
ever
held
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
isn't
it
brand
new?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
the
unique
procedural
posture
is
precisely
the
reason
that
the
rule
is
brand
new.
if
it's
unique,
we've
never
had
it
before.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
even
anything
--
i
mean,
it
does
raise
a
judicial
estoppel
issue,
but
i'm
not
sure
there
is
a
--
a
record
hereupon
which
a
--
a
judicial
estoppel
claim
could
be
maintained,
because
in
the
passages
that
you
referred
us
to,
first
the
state's
concession
and
secondly
the
finding
which
--
which
followed
from
it,
it
was
a
reference
to
mild
mental
retardation
and
a
specific
reference
to
an
iq
of
69.
i
think
it's
a
stretch,
would
be
a
stretch,
to
go
from
saying
that
a
concession
of
mild
mental
retardation
for
purposes
of
mitigation
analysis
should
be
taken
as
a
concession
for
dispositive
mental
retardation
for
atkins
purposes.
so
i
--
i
have
difficulty
in
seeing
any
clear
inconsistency
in
the
state's
two
positions.
