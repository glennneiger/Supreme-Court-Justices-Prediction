mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
three
separate
lines
of
double
jeopardy
analysis
lead
independently
to
the
conclusion
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
commits
the
ohio
postconviction
court
to
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
mr.
bies
is
mentally
retarded
for
purposes
of
atkins.
first,
there
has
been
no
acquittal
in
this
case.
second,
there
is
no
successive
jeopardy;
and,
third,
even
if
collateral
estoppel
analysis
applies
under
ashe
versus
swenson,
the
atkins
issue
has
not
actually
and
necessarily
been
decided.
each
of
these
factors
shows
that
the
ohio
court's
decision
to
go
forward
with
the
atkins
hearing
was
reasonable,
and
this
court
therefore
should,
consistent
with
aedpa,
give
the
ohio
courts
their
first
chance
to
adjudicate
mr.
bies's
atkins
claim.
much
of
the
dispute
in
this
case
centers
on
the
parties'
disagreement
over
the
meaning
of
ashe
versus
swenson
and
its
application.
but
mr.
bies
cannot
benefit
from
ashe
because
ashe
--
the
ashe
collateral
estoppel
rule
only
operates
to
benefit
defendants
who
have
in
hand
an
earlier
acquittal,
and
mr.
bies
has
never
been
acquitted
of
the
death
penalty
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
this
court,
beginning
in
bullington
and
extending
through
sattazahn,
has
defined
an
"acquittal"
in
a
death
penalty
context
as
a
finding
by
the
sentencer
that
the
death
--
that
the
sentence
of
death
is
warranted
in
a
particular
case.
and
the
--
the
jury
and
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
agreed
that
death
was
warranted,
and,
in
fact,
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
every
reviewing
court
has
agreed
that
death
was
warranted.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
the
reason
to
do
it
again,
your
honor,
is
because
the
--
the
standard
set
forth
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
lott
when
it
was
implementing
this
court's
decision
in
atkins
contained
three
definitions
--
three
elements
of
the
atkins
definition,
of
the
definition
of
"mental
retardation".
and
those
three
elements
were
not
carefully
demonstrated
by
dr.
winter.
and,
in
fact,
the
--
the
record
here
--
the
ohio
post-conviction
court
has
concluded
--
doesn't
suffice
to
make
the
post-atkins
lott
determination.
the
--
at
pages
101a
to
104a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
state
postconviction
court
looks
at
all
the
evidence,
including
dr.
winter's
testimony,
and
says
that
there
needs
to
be
a
hearing
where
experts
will
be
called
in
order
to
determine
whether
mr.
bies
not
only
suffers
from
significant
intellectual
limitations,
which
includes
iq,
but
there
is
conflicting
iq
evidence
in
the
record.
it
also
includes
findings
that
he
suffers
from
substantial
limitations
in
adaptive
skills,
the
skills
needed
for
daily
life,
which
dr.
winter
never
specifically
spoke
about.
she
spoke
only
about
iq
when
she
was
talking
about
mental
retardation.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
no,
it
cannot.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
it
can,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
it
can
be.
yes,
i'm
sorry.
it
can't
be
preclusive.
it
can
be
reopened
for
two
reasons,
one
relating
to
the
definition
of
"mental
retardation"
post-atkins
and
the
other
relating
to
the
different
issues.
first,
with
respect
to
the
definition,
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
made
clear
in
lott
that
iq
is
not
enough
to
determine
mental
retardation.
in
fact,
the
--
the
clinicians
and
the
american
association
of
mental
retardation
say
that
iq
is
not
enough,
particularly
in
a
borderline
case
where
iq
is
close
to
the
line.
and
there
you
need
to
look
very
carefully
at
adaptive
skills.
moreover--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--and--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--and
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
your
honor,
for
issue
preclusive
purposes,
because
the
issue
is
completely
different
in
the
mitigation
context
from
the
post-atkins
context.
and
i
think
that
difference
is
highlighted
by
the
difference
between
penry
and
atkins.
pre-atkins
what
the
sentencer
was
talking
about,
the
jury
and
then
the
ohio
supreme
court
when
it
affirmed,
was
what
this
court
told
it
to
talk
about
in
penry.
it
was
talking
about
mental
retardation
as
a
mitigating
factor,
and
the
state
of
ohio
and
the
ohio
courts
had
no
definition
of
"mental
retardation"
pre-atkins.
in
fact,
i
think
if
there
had
been
a
definition
and
if
the
courts
had
excluded
evidence
from
the
jury
that
didn't
rise
to
a
certain
level
of
severity,
then
we
would
have
run
into
a
--
a
post
--
a
penry
and
tennard
problem.
and
so
all
of
the
evidence
was
allowed
in,
and
it
was
treated
as
mitigating.
and
so
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
doing
was
what
penry
told
it
to
do:
considering
mitigating
evidence
of
mental
retardation.
but
post-atkins
the
inquiries
are
different,
because
atkins
effectively
constitutionalized
a
clinical
judgment
in
making
--
in
defining
a
categorical
bar
on
executing
the
mentally
retarded.
and
so
post-atkins
it
is
necessary
to
be
very
careful
about
the
clinical
judgment,
and
this
record
does
not
suffice
for
that
clinical
judgment.
and
i
think
it
--
think
it
does
not
behoove
either
party
to
suggest
that
the
record--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--the
--
the
clinical
judgment
that
i
refer
to,
your
honor,
is
that
required
by
--
by
lott.
it
looks
not
only
at
iq,
but
also
at
the
adaptive
skills
limitation.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
because,
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
two
different
meanings
of
"necessary".
it
was
--
it
was
necessary
in
the
sense
that
it
had
to
be
done,
but
it
wasn't
necessary
in
the
issue
preclusive
offense
because
it
--
it
was--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--correct.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
and
--
and--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--the
--
the
appellate
courts
engaged
in
a
de
novo
record
and
new
--
new
evidence
doesn't
come
into
the
record
on
direct
review.
but
there
is
still
argument
--
the
parties
are
still
in
an
adversarial
posture.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
there
wasn't
at
the
time
a
--
a
great
deal
of
incentive
to
litigate
that
question
because
the
ohio
supreme
court
had
said
that
mental
retardation
only
merited
some
weight
in
mitigation.
and,
in
fact,
the
--
the
appellate
briefs
on
direct
review
are
in
the
joint
appendix
and
--
excerpts
of
those
briefs.
and
mr.
bies
himself
on
direct
review
didn't
vigorously
argue
his
mental
retardation
evidence.
in
fact,
he
said
that
the,
"arguably",
in
his
words,
"the
most
persuasive
mitigating
evidence"
was
his
lack
of
a
prior
record
and
his
lack
of
prior
violent
history.
and
so
none
of
the
parties
thought
that
mental
retardation
in
1992
through
1996
was
very
persuasive,
because
the
courts
didn't
treat
it
and
the
jury
didn't
treat
it
as
very
persuasive,
perhaps
for
the
reasons
that
this
court
underscored
in
atkins,
where
the
court
said
that,
as
it
had
said
in
penry,
that
mental
retardation
evidence
presented
to
a
jury
in
mitigation
could
be
a
two-edged
sword,
because
some
jurors
might
perceive
and
the
prosecutor
might
argue
that
that
evidence
went
to
future
dangerousness,
and
therefore
the
--
the
state
of
ohio
argued
that
the
mental
retardation
evidence
here
was
simply
not
persuasive
and
it
was
outweighed
by
the
--
the
aggravating
factors
that
the
jury
had
found.
atkins
told
the--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
it's
fairest
and
the
record
that's
easiest
to
go
by
is
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
said,
because
the
jury
didn't
make
any
specific
remarks
about
mental
retardation
as
a
mitigator;
the
ohio
supreme
court
did.
but
the
--
the
jury's
verdict
and
then
the
ohio
supreme
court's
affirmance
should
best
be
read
as
a
determination
that
the
aggravating
factors
outweigh
the
mitigating
factors
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
that
mental
retardation
was
one
of
those
mitigating
factors.
but
it
should
not
be
read
as
a
mini-verdict
on
the
existence
of
or
the
question
of
whether
mr.
bies
is
mentally
retarded.
because--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--the
judge
charged
the
jury
that
--
first
of
all,
your
honor,
the
mitigating
evidence
introduced
by
mr.
bies
was
not
extensive.
he
--
he
introduced
an
unsworn
statement
by
himself
and
then
dr.
winter
testified,
and
that
was
the
extent
of
the
case
in
mitigation.
so
the
jury
was
charged
with
the
various
statutory
mitigating
factors
in
ohio,
which
is
found
in
ohio
revised
code
2929.04.
the
mental
retardation
evidence
was
relevant
under
two
of
those
mitigating
statutory
factors,
one,
factor
3,
which
went
to
mental
disease
or
defect,
and
then
the
catch-all,
factor
7.
but
the
--
but
i
think
poland
helps
to
illuminate
what
the
--
not
only
what
the
jury
was
doing,
but
also
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
doing
when
it--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--we
don't,
your
honor.
all
that
we
know
is
that
the
jury
determined
that
the
aggravating
factors
outweighed
the
mitigators
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
what
we
do
know
and
what
the
sixth
circuit
hung
its
hat
on
was
the
statement
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
on
direct
review
that
mr.
bies's
mental
retardation
merits
weight
in
mitigation.
poland
explains
that
that
--
that
statement
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
should
not
be
treated
as
a
mini-verdict
on
the
mitigating
factor,
but
instead
it
should
be
read
as
an
eighth
amendment-required
marking
of
the
guidepost,
the
very
guidepost
that
this
court
in
penry
said
must
be
marked,
the
relevance
of
mitigating
evidence
of
mental
retardation.
but
--
but
poland
says
it's
wrong
to
think
of
that
marking
of
that
eighth
amendment
guidepost
as
a
mini-verdict
on
mental
retardation,
and
instead
it
should
just
be
thought
of
as
one
of
the
factors
that
was
bounding
the
discretion
of
the
sentencer.
and
so
poland
instructs
that
mr.
bies
and
the
sixth
circuit
are
wrong
to
think
of
mental
retardation
as
actually
having
been
found
in
some
sense
that
affords
preclusive
effect,
because
instead
it
was
just
an
eighth
amendment
balancing.
and
instead
what
atkins
tells
us
is
that
the
state
of
ohio,
just
as
the
states
were
given
the
opportunity
after
ford
v.
wainwright
in
the
insanity
context,
should
be
given
the
opportunity
for
the
very
first
time
in
this
case
to
implement
atkins
to
determine,
given
clinical
expert
judgment,
whether
or
not
mr.
bies
is
in
fact
mentally
retarded
under
the
three-part--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--the
answer
is
that
the
state
is
not
bound,
for
two
reasons,
the
first
relating
to
issue
preclusion
and
the
second
relating
to
the
double
jeopardy
doctrine
in
ashe.
on
issue
preclusion,
the
--
the
finding
with
respect
to
the
gun
doesn't
carry
preclusive
effect
because
this
court
said
in
--
sunnen
and
other
cases
that
when
there
is
a
change
in
legal
consequences,
that
change
is
enough
to
prevent
the
operation
of
preclusive
rules.
but
on
the
double
jeopardy
doctrine--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--no,
your
honor,
because
it
is
important
to
remember
that
this
is
--
this
is
a
double
jeopardy
case
because
of
ashe,
and
because
this
is
in
federal
habeas.
with
respect
to
your
question
about
due
process
or
--
or
other
rules
aside
from
due
process,
it's
possible
that
the
state
could
have
more
expansive
common
law
or
state
law
interpretations
of
the
collateral
estoppel
rules,
and
maybe
those
would
benefit
the
defendant.
this
court
in
--
in
the
hoag
case
declined
to
use
due
process
to
incorporate
collateral
estoppel
rules
constitutionally.
so
in
your
case
the
defendant
would
only
be
left
with
the
hope
that
the
state
would
have
more
expansive
collateral
estoppel
rules.
but
to
return
to
ashe,
the
defendant
here
is
claiming
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
constitutionalized
version
of
collateral
estoppel
because
of
ashe,
but
he's
not
entitled
to
that
protection
because
ashe
applies
only
where
a
defendant
has
previously
been
acquitted,
and
he
has
not.
it
also
applies
only
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
is
facing
a
successive
jeopardy
of
some
sort.
now,
mr.
bies's
sentence
is
--
is
surely
at
issue
in
this
case,
but
it's
at
issue
in
the
sense
that
it
would
be
at
issue
in,
say,
a
direct
appeal.
it's
only
--
there
has
only
been
one
prosecution.
the
state
has
only
taken
one
crack
at
convicting
him
or
imposing
a
sentence,
and
that
one
sentence
is
what's
at
issue
here.
and
so
there
is
not
anything
successive
about
this
case,
and
so
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
either
through
the
put-in-jeopardy
text
or
through
the
acquittal
requirement,
simply
has
nothing
to
offer
mr.
bies
in
the
way
of
assistance.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
your
honor,
we're
not
contending
that
the
ashe
claim
is
unexhausted.
we
agree
that
that's
exhausted
because
in
the
ohio
courts
it
is
not
permissible
to
take
an
interlocutory
appeal
when
a
double
jeopardy
claim
has
been
denied,
as
it
was
in
this
case.
and
so
we
are
fine
with
the
sixth
circuit
precedent
that
holds
that
in
that
case
the
federal
courts
can
act
in
habeas
to
prevent
exposure
to
a
double
jeopardy.
we
simply
maintain
that
there
is
no
second
jeopardy
here.
but
the
atkins
claim
itself
is
unexhausted,
and
the
federal
magistrate
that
first
dealt
with
this
case
in
federal
court
held
that
it
was
unexhausted.
and
so
now
this
case
needs
to
go
back
down
to
the
ohio
postconviction
court,
for
what
that
court
to
do
what
it
was
about
to
do,
which
is
to
hold
an
atkins
hearing
for
the
very
first
time
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
no,
your
honor.
the
ohio
postconviction
court
said
at
pages
101
to
104a
of
the
petition
appendix
that
the
iq
remains
in
question.
dr.
winters
testified
at
trial
that
it
was
68
or
69;
she
wasn't
perfectly
consistent.
but
other
record
evidence
introduced
later
on
postconviction
proceedings
is
not
consistent
with
that,
and
so
that
still
needs
to
be
definitively--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--that
evidence
is
in
the
ja,
and
it
was
introduced
after
--
after
the
ohio
supreme
court
had
issued
the
decision
at
issue
in
this
case.
so
that
evidence
is
in
the
record,
but
it
is
not
part
of
the
ohio
supreme
court's
finding.
it
was
introduced
on
postconviction
review.
so
it
needs
to
be
considered
by
the
experts
and
by
the
postconviction
court
when
this
goes
back
to--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--absolutely,
your
honor,
in
order
to
be
constitutionally
consistent
with
--
with
atkins.
but
that
would
be
borne
out
through
the
--
the
adversarial
process
in
the
atkins
hearing
that
hasn't
occurred
yet.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
first,
with
respect
to
the
judicial
estoppel
arguments
and
the
state's
purported
concessions,
as
justice
ginsburg
noted,
the
statement
to
which
mr.
bies
points
was
pre-atkins,
and
mr.
bies's
argument
ignores
that
atkins
changed
things
in
two
ways:
one
consequential,
by
enacting,
by
placing
a
categorical
bar
on
the
states;
and
the
second,
definitional.
so
for
the
reasons
stated
of
our
--
in
our
yellow
brief
at
pages
16
to
18,
the
judicial
estoppel
argument
fails
for
all
kinds
of
reasons.
but
more
to
the
point,
judicial
estoppel
shouldn't
apply
here
also
because
the
state,
whatever
it
was
saying
at
the
time,
was
not
talking
about
the
three-part
post-atkins
definition
of
mental
retardation
in
ohio.
mr.
bies
also
argues
that
2254(d)(2)
is
enough
to
give
support
to
--
to
the
sixth
circuit's
grant
of
relief
--
of
relief
here,
but
there
are
two
problems
with
that
argument.
the
first
problem
is
that
the
sixth
circuit
disregarded
the
reasonable
determination
by
the
state's
postconviction
court
that
the
atkins
standard
had
never
been
applied.
the
second
problem
is
that
we
shouldn't
even
get
to
2254(d)(2)
because
there
are
legal
problems
with
the
sixth
circuit's
reasoning
that
should
have
prevented
it
from
granting
the
writ
under
2254(d)(1).
mr.
bies
argues
that
there
is
not
a
legal
problem
because
there
was
an
acquittal
in
this
case,
because
the
ohio
supreme
court's
statement
on
direct
review
that
mr.
bies
--
that
mr.
bies's
mild
to
borderline
mental
retardation
merits
weight
and
mitigation
was
enough
to
entitle
him
to
a
life
sentence.
but
that's
not
an
acquittal,
and
it's
a
severe
distortion
of
what
this
court
said
in
sattazahn
about
an
acquittal.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
no,
your
honor,
the
--
this
statement
will
be
beside
the
point,
and
the
question
now
post-atkins--
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
--the
--
the
question
is,
the
question
posed
in
atkins
doesn't
hinge
so
narrowly
on
iq.
iq
is
one
of
the
three
elements,
and
so
the
experts
on
--
on
postconviction
review
will
now
determine
what
his
iq
is.
mr.
benjamin
c.
mizer
yes,
your
honor,
as
the
state
postconviction
court
stated
in
this
case,
that
--
the
record
evidence
pertaining
to
iq
is
not
clear;
and
so
iq,
among
all
of
the
other
elements
of
the
mental
retardation,
will
be
up
for
determination.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
you
reverse
the
sixth
circuit.
