justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
the
argument
that
the
issues
are
not
quite
the
same,
that
the
atkins
issue
of
mental
retardation
is
not
quite
the
same
as
the
issue
that
was
litigated.
let's
try
and
get
that
out
of
the
case.
i
think
that's
where
justice
kennedy
was
going.
suppose
it
was
a
gun
case
and
the
supreme
court
originally
thought
you
could
convict
people
who
sell
drugs
of
simple
possession
of
a
gun.
there's
a
finding,
because
it's
a
bench
trial,
that
he
simply
possessed
but
did
not
otherwise
use
the
gun.
then
the
supreme
court
holds
that
that
isn't
enough
under
the
statute.
so
now
the
state
wants
to
argue,
because
the
proceeding
on
appeal
or
whatever
is
still
going
on,
we
want
a
second
shot
at
this;
we
want
to
show
he
did
more
than
simply
possess.
is
the
state
bound
by
what
it
previously
lost
on
or
can
the
state
--
can
he
get
a
second
shot?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
double
jeopardy.
i
don't
think
necessarily
that
it's
double
jeopardy
that
--
that
is
relevant
here.
but
i
have
a
--
have
you
run
into
this
in
a
different
context?
they
wouldn't
use
the
word
"double
jeopardy".
it
would
be
some
kind
of
due
process
problem.
maybe
there
isn't
a
problem.
have
you
run
in
your
research
to
anything
like
what
i
described?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
reopen
--
it's
--
it's
the
same
problem.
and
maybe
you
found
some
authority
to
the
contrary,
other
than
statements,
but
actual
authority.
the
defendant
loses.
he
appeals.
he
says
they
made
a
mistake.
and
the
normal
remedy
is
you
give
him
a
new
trial.
does
it
matter
that
it's
a
collateral
proceeding?
i
don't
think
so.
they
go
to
the
federal
court:
judge,
they
made
a
mistake
at
my
trial.
you
give
him
a
new
trial.
everything's
up
for
grabs
normally
at
the
new
trial.
i
can't
think
of
an
instance
where
it
isn't.
here,
they
are
saying:
judge,
they
made
a
mistake.
they
should
have
applied
the
mental
retardation
rule
of
atkins.
so
give
him
a
new
trial.
now,
what
i'm
looking
for
is
just
one
example
somewhere
that
supports
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
didn't
proceed
on
the
theory
i've
just
announced
or
just
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
want
a
case
even
vaguely
like
that.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
argument,
then
--
we're
getting
somewhere
maybe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
to
me,
think
of
jackson
and
denno,
if
you're
in
a
collateral
proceeding
and
the
federal
judge
said
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
to
convict
him
under
the
constitution,
like
the
shuffling
sam
case,
there
isn't
enough
evidence;
it
isn't
that
he
gets
a
new
trial.
the
constitution
entitles
him
to
acquittal,
and
therefore
there
is
no
new
trial
because
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you're
saying
here,
the
evidence
the
first
time
was
such
that
they
couldn't
give
him
the
death
penalty
under
the
constitution
as
later
interpreted.
so
if
that's
what
you
discover
on
the
collateral
appeal,
a
similar
reasoning
would
somehow
lead
you
to
the
similar
result.
is
that
the
argument?
