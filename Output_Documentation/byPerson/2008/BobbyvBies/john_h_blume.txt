mr.
john
h.
blume
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
much
of
the
discussion
so
far
has
focused
on
issues
which
did
not
form
the
basis
of
the
panel's
decision.
the
panel
decided
this
case
under
2254(d)(2).
and
what
the
panel
determined
was
that
the
state
court's
decision
that
dr.
winter,
who
was
the
testifying
psychiatrist,
did
not
apply
the
clinical
definition
of
mental
retardation
in
forming
her
opinions
and
rendering
her
conclusions
was
an
unreasonable
determination
of
the
facts
in
light
of
the
evidence
presented
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
and
it
was
on
that
basis
the
court
went
through
the
evidence
and
determined
that,
in
fact,
dr.
winter
had
used
the
clinical
definition
of
mental
retardation
in
rendering
her
opinion,
and
that
that
meant
that
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
made
a
finding
of
mental
retardation
based
on
the
clinical
--
the
clinical
definition
of
mental
retardation.
mr.
john
h.
blume
no,
i
think
it
is.
it's
not
as
if
there's
something--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--pardon
me?
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes,
it
was.
but
the--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--that's
true,
but
the
--
the
important
point,
i
think,
that
formed
the
basis
of
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
was
that
in
lott
versus
--
which
is
the
ohio
decision
post-atkins,
in
lott
they
said
we're
embracing
the
clinical
definition
of
mental
retardation.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
clearly
that
is
the
more
typical
procedural
context,
and
it
happens
normally
in
the
criminal
context
of
someone
that's
been
acquitted.
but
the
procedural
posture
here
is
unique,
because
what
you
have
is
a
prior
finding
of
mental
retardation
pre-atkins,
and
clearly,
at
least
according
to
the
panel,
using
the
definition
of
mental
retardation
which
is
now
in
effect
in
ohio.
then
subsequent
to
that
you
had
this
court's
decision
in
ohio
--
i
mean
this
court's
decision
in
atkins,
which
creates
a
retroactive
new
rule
which
says
that
people
with
mental
retardation
can't
be
executed.
the
essence
of
a
retroactive
new
rule
is
that
it
attaches
new
legal
consequences
to
prior
conduct.
so
it
is
both
the
rule
of
ashe,
which
says
when
an
issue
has
been
determined
in
a
final
proceeding,
combined
with
this
court's
decision
in
atkins
placing
a
category
of
people--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
minimizes
or
does
not
give
adequate
significance
to
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
describes
as
its
role
in
--
on
the
appellate
review.
and
they
describe
their
role
as
being
that
they
engage
in
an
independent
reweighing
of
the
mitigation
against
the
aggravation.
a
first
step
of
that
is
the
identification
of
the
mitigating
circumstances.
so
they
have
taken
it
upon
themselves
to
identify
the
mitigating
circumstances,
and
they
have
to
do
that
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
which
is
the
same
standard
which
exists
now
in
a
lott
proceeding.
in
the
course
of
reviewing
mr.
bies's
sentence
on
appeal,
intermediate
appeal
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
the
ohio
supreme
court,
both
courts
found
that
mr.
bies
had
mental
retardation.
it's
not
also
--
i
mean,
they
have
described
this
as
an
essential
function
of
their
role,
and
they
also
don't
do
it
uncritically.
there
are
other
cases,
state
v.
white
for
example,
in
which
they
made
an
express
finding
that
the
individual
had
not
proven
his
mental
retardation.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
on
the
first
point,
i
didn't
mean
that
it
necessarily
matters
which
court
it
did.
i
was
saying
that
--
trying
to
describe
--
usually
the
necessary
part,
which
is
in
some
ways
what
we're
talking
about
here,
was
it
necessary,
turns
on
two
considerations.
and
the
necessary
--
it's
designed
to
determine,
as
i
understand
it,
one,
was
the
issue
decided;
and,
two,
was
it
decided
with
some
care
for
its
significance
to
the
proceeding?
and
i
think,
given
the
unique
way
in
which
ohio
does
the
sentence
review,
both
of
those
concerns
are
satisfied.
as
for--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--yes,
it
could
have.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
i--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
that
is
not
my
reading
of
the
necessary
cases.
i
read
that
the
function
that
the
necessary
prong
serves
as
trying
to
serve
two
goals.
number
one,
was
the
issue,
the
question,
the
issue--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
i
mean
--
again,
that
is
not
my
understanding
of
the
role
the
necessary
clause
plays.
but
now,
on
to
the
winner
point.
so
if
that's
necessary
--
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
ashe
v.
swenson
that
says
you
have
to
win
on
the
ultimate
outcome.
it's
do
you
win
on
the
fact.
if
that's
right
--
and
let's
imagine--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
understand.
mr.
john
h.
blume
but
the
ashe
rule
is
stated
in
terms
of
when
an
issue
of
fact
has
been
determined
in
a
defendant's
favor
it's
binding
in
any
subsequent
litigation.
but
if
the
warden
is
right
--
and
let's
imagine
now
mr.
bies
goes
back
for
his
mental
retardation
hearing,
and
the
court
says:
yes,
mr.
bies
is
mentally
retarded;
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
atkins
was
wrongly
decided.
it
goes
up
on
appeal
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
they
say:
yes,
mr.
bies
is
mentally
retarded,
but
we
think
atkins
was
wrongly
decided.
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
and
you
summarily
reverse
and
say
atkins
is
still
the
law
of
the
land.
now
it
goes
back,
and
the
warden
could
then
say:
well,
now
that
we
know
you're
serious
about
atkins,
we
want
to
reopen
the
judgment
and
we
want
another
shot--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
i
--
i
mean,
i
can't
give
you
a
case
exactly
like
that,
but,
again,
i
think
the
procedure--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
think
what
you
have
are
the
cases
--
you
had
the
cases
which
essentially
are
the
legal
equivalent
of
insufficient
evidence
on
appeal.
now,
that's
not
technically
an
acquittal,
but
it's
treated
as
an
acquittal.
but
what
you
have
here
is
a
finding
of
fact
combined
with
a
later
decision
on
the
--
establishing
a
retroactive
new
rule,
moving
people
outside--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it
would
have
to
do
one
of
two
things.
it
would
either
have
to
absolve
the
criminal
defendant
of
liability,
which
is
sort
of
the
common
rule
under
ashe,
or
it
would
have
to
render
him
ineligible
for
the
death
penalty,
though
the
definition
of
acquittal
used
in
sattazahn
is
had
there
been
a
finding
which
--
legally
sufficient
to
legally
entitle
the
defendant
to
a
life
sentence.
and
it
is
mr.
bies's
position
that
the
finding
of
mental
retardation--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
it's
a
theory
of
collateral
estoppel
which
is
based
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
which
is
what
--
the
issue
on
which
the
panel
resolved
this
question.
and
i
think
that
--
as
i
read
the
collateral
estoppel
cases,
again
and
even
in
the
context
of
capital
sentencing
and
double
jeopardy,
the
finding
would
have
to
be
either
at
the
--
at
the
criminal
liability
stage,
would
it
absolve
the
defendant
of
liability,
like
in
the
ashe
context.
the
finding
was
one
of
identity.
in
the
first
trial,
the
jury
acquitted.
the
only
issue
was
identity.
when
this
court
looked
at
the
record
as
a
whole
--
and
then
they
said,
okay,
you
can't
subsequently
litigate
the
prior
--
the
nuts
crimes
on
the
issue
of
identity.
in
the
capital
sentencing
context,
at
least
here,
a
finding
of
mental
retardation
is
a
finding
sufficient
to
entitle
the
defendant--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--pardon
me?
mr.
john
h.
blume
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
blume
that's
more
or
less
the
argument.
and
the
panel--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
it
is
the
combination
of
the
determination
that
mr.
bies
is
a
person
with
mental
retardation
using
the
same
definition
according
to
the
panel,
which
is
now
in
effect
in
the
state
of
ohio,
which
would
apply
in
a
lott
proceeding
if
he
were
to
have
it
tomorrow.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
it
is
the
combination
of
that
factual
determination
with
the
subsequent
rule,
a
retroactive
new
rule.
i
mean,
it's
unusual
because
there
are
very
few
retroactive
new
rules
of
procedure
which
place
someone
outside--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it
could
be
used
if
there
is
a
later
legal
ruling
which
means
the
significance
of
that
fact
would
either
absolve
the
criminal
defendant
of
liability
or
make
him
ineligible
for
death.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
don't
think
it
is
a
brand-new
rule.
mr.
john
h.
blume
but
i
think
the
reason
you
haven't
isn't--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it's
because
of
the
unique
procedural
posture
of
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
blume
but--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
determination
of
what
the
panel
did
in
this
case.
what
the
panel
said
is,
number
one,
that
we
look
at
the
procedure
and
definition
of
mental
retardation
that
ohio
has
adopted.
now,
it
is
the
same
as
the
definition
of
mental
retardation
which
was
used
by
dr.
winter
in
her
testimony
in
mr.
bies's
trial,
and
is
the
--
that
is
the
sole
basis
for
the
determination.
and
they
said
the
burdens
of
proof
are
the
same.
he
had
the
burden
of
establishing
this
fact
of
mental
retardation
by
a
preponderance,
and
that's
the
same.
so,
therefore,
on
that
basis,
they
decided
he--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--well,
i
don't
think,
justice
ginsburg,
the
incentives
have
to
be
identical,
but
certainly
prior
to
atkins
the
prosecution
had
the
incentive
to
contest
the
mental
retardation
question,
and
in
fact
in
this
case
the
failure
to
more
adequately
contest
it
wasn't
due
to
a
lack
of
incentives,
it
was
due
to
a
lack
of
evidence.
there
were
three
experts
that
evaluated
mr.
bies,
all
of
whom
came
to
virtually
identical
conclusions.
about
his
mental
state.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
i
think
for
three
reasons,
mr.
chief
justice.
number
one,
as
this
court
recognized
in
atkins,
in
cases
where
there
was
evidence
of
mental
retardation,
the
jury
was
much
less
likely
to
impose
a
death
sentence;
that
in
part
was
part
of
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
in
atkins.
second,
on
appeal,
by
not
contesting
the
evidence
--
the
state
of
ohio
did
contest
it
here
--
you
ran
the
risk
that
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
or
the
ohio
supreme
court
would
reach
a
different
conclusion,
number
one,
on
the
balance
of
aggravation
and
mitigation;
or,
number
two,
on
whether
the
death
sentence
was
disproportion.
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
had
done
that
in
several
other
cases.
but
here
also,
right,
you
had
not
only
the
direct
appeal
and
the
findings,
but
you
have
additional
findings
and
concessions
in
state
postconviction,
where
mr.
bies
goes
in
in
state
postconviction,
and
he
raises
a
pre-atkins
categorical
bar
claim,
and
says
i'm
a
person
with
mental
retardation;
since
this
court's
decision
in
penry,
things
have
changed;
and
i
believe
my
death
sentence
is
disproportionate
under
the
ohio
and
the
united
states
constitution.
in
response
to
that,
the
state,
number
one,
conceded
mental
retardation
and
said
we
agree
the
record
reveals
mr.
bies
is
a
person
with
mental
retardation,
and
the
postconviction
court
then
enters
a
finding
of
fact.
mr.
john
h.
blume
no,
they
said
the
record
reveals
mr.
bies
to
be
a
person
with
mental
retardation,
with
an
iq
of
69.
it
is
not
that
there
was,
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument,
it
was
nothing
like
a
mitigating.
it
was
a
finding
of
fact,
now
that
mr.
bies
was
a
person--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
153.
this
is
actually
the
state
court
order,
the
finding
of
fact,
and
it
says:
findings
of
fact.
the
defendant
is
shown
by
the
record
to
be
mildly
mentally
retarded
with
an
iq
of
69.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i'm
sorry,
that
is
both
at
ja
143
where
--
ja
143
in
the
state's
motion,
response
for
judgment:
"the
record
reveals
defendant
to
be
mildly
mentally
retarded
with
an
iq
of
69.
"
and
that
concession
is
repeated
in
the
post
conviction
appeal
at
page
160
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
it
primarily
does
raise
a
question
of
judicial
estoppel,
which
we
raised,
which
is
--
and
that
is
not
a
technical
basis
on
which
to
grant
habeas.
it
is
a
reason
that
the
writ
should
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
there
have
been
multiple
concessions
after
that.
this
was
raised
by
mr.
bies
in
his,
sort
of
--
when
he
asked
for
estoppel,
he
asked
for
it
on
multiple
bases.
just
as
the
fact
that
the
warden,
the
panel
again
decided
this
under
2254(d)(2)
grounds.
the
warden
did
not
raise
an
issue
under
2254(d)(2)
in
this
court.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
not
in
regard
to
this
particular
claim.
the
claim
that
we're
talking
about
where
this
concession
was
made
and
where
this
finding
was
made
wasn't
--
this
wasn't
the
brief
on
mitigation,
this
was
a
postconviction
challenge
to
his
death
sentence
as
a
matter
of
law,
saying--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it
was
pre-atkins,
but
the
claim
was
a
pre-atkins
atkins
claim.
the
claim
was
not
--
was
i
am
categorically
ineligible
for
the
death
penalty,
and
i
am
ineligible
because
since
the
court's
decision
in
atkins,
things
have
changed.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
that
was
the
claim.
his
claim
was
it
violates
the
eighth
amendment
to
excuse
people
with
mental
retardation.
this
was
not
--
this
was
after
the
direct
appeal.
he
now
filed
for
post
conviction
and
he
goes
in
and
says,
look,
i've
been
sort
of
tracking
things
since
atkins;
states
have
--
adopt
new
laws.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i'm
sorry,
since
penry.
since
penry
there
have
been
new
developments,
and
i
believe
that
a
new
consensus
exists,
the
one
that
this
court
subsequently
embraced,
and
it
violates
the
eighth
amendment
and
the
ohio
constitution
to
execute
persons
with
mental
retardation.
and
it
was
in
response
to
that
claim
that
the
state
conceded
the
fact
of
mental
retardation,
and
it
was
in
response
to
that
claim
that
the
state
court
found
again
mr.
bies
to
be
a
person
with
mental
retardation.
that
wasn't
in
some
question
of
the
balance
of
aggravating
circumstances.
that
was
a
straight
claim
that
you
cannot
execute
me
because
i
have
mental
retardation.
and
so
i
was
really
responding
more
to
justice
souter's
questions
of
judicial
estoppel
and
was
it
the
same
issue
in
this,
and
i
think
it
clearly
was
at
that
time
in
this
particular
context.
thank
you.
