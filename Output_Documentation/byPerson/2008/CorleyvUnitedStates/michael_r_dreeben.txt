mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
important
in
this
case
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
original
rule
of
exclusion
that
this
court
developed
in
the
mcnabb
case
in
1943
and
then
reiterated
in
the
mallory
case
in
1957.
both
of
those
cases
considered
a
pre-miranda
regime
in
which
there
was
no
constitutional
law
that
required
that
a
suspect
be
advised
of
his
rights.
under
rule
5
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
under
statutes
that
preceded
it
that
were
in
effect
at
the
time
of
mcnabb,
the
only
way
to
ensure
that
a
suspect
was
informed
of
his
rights
to
silence
and
counsel
was
to
bring
him
before
a
magistrate,
and
the
magistrate
would
advise
him
of
those
rights.
this
court
in
mcnabb
and
mallory
thus
fashioned
a
judicial
rule
of
evidence,
an
exclusionary
rule,
under
the
court's
supervisory
power
not
as
an
effectuation
of
something
that
congress
specifically
intended
but
of
its
own
force
as
a
way
to
backstop
the
rule
5
requirement.
in
the
government's
view,
two
acts
that
came
subsequently
to
mcnabb
and
mallory,
section
3501
and
rule
402
of
the
federal
rules
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
stevens,
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
any
evidentiary
sanction
that
could
be
imposed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
none
has
arisen
in
the
case
law
that
i
could
point
your
honor
to.
i
think
the
primary
safeguard
of
the
enforcement
of
rule
5
is
the
obligation
that's
placed
on
the
government
and
on
government
agents
to
comply
with
rules
of
criminal
procedure
that
are
valid.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
that
they
are,
justice
stevens,
because
the
--
the
critical
thing
that
the
court
was
doing
in
mallory
and
mcnabb
was
trying
to
come
up
with
a
way
to
ensure
that
suspects
were
advised
of
their
rights
to
protect
against
abuses
in
the
interrogation
process.
and
the
court's
ultimate
constitutional
solution
to
that
lay
years
in
the
future.
it
came
in
the
form
of
miranda.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
what
the
court
was
after--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that
it
was
not
the
sole
motivating
factor
in
mcnabb.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
do
not
agree
that
it
would
have
equal
strength,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
certainly,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
excessive
delay
can
be
a
--
it
is
by
statute
a
factor
that
will
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
voluntariness.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
it's
unenforceable
by
the
exclusion
of
a
confession
that
results
from
what
a
court
concludes
is
unnecessary
delay.
and
i
think
that
that
is
true
for
two
reasons,
by
virtue
of
congressional
action
and
rulemaking
action.
and
i
think
that
as
an
additional
factor
this
court,
which
struck
that
supervisory
powers
balance
in
a
pre-miranda
era,
would
do
well
to
consider
whether
the
factors
that
motivated
it
to
suppress
confessions
in
mcnabb
and
mallory
should
still
be
evaluated
the
same
way
today.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
the
suspect
was
given
his
miranda
rights
and
waived
them
and
agreed
to
give
a
confession.
there
are
three
circuits
and
the
d.c.
local
court
which
all
have
concluded
that
a
waiver
of
miranda
rights
waives
the
right
to
prompt
presentment.
so
the
question
of
whether
there
was,
in
fact,
unnecessary
delay
that
would
constitute
a
violation
of
rule
5
has
not
been
litigated
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is
certainly
challengeable
on
voluntariness
grounds.
now,
the
court's
motive
in--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
they
do
have
something
to
lose--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
stevens,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
correct
that
a
waiver
of
miranda
rights
waives
the
prompt-presentment
right
and
prevents
an
objection
based
on
whatever
survives
of
mcnabb-mallory,
the
officers
are
doing
nothing
wrong
if
they
obtain
a
valid
miranda
waiver.
and
this
was
just
not
a
factor
that
the
court
had
on
the
horizon
when
it
decided
mcnabb
and
mallory.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
souter,
i
think
that's
purely
a
question
of
policy
of
whether
there
should
be
such
a
strong
exclusionary
rule
that
mandates
the
barring
from
admission
into
evidence
of
a
purely
voluntary
confession
where
there's
no
dispute
about
its
voluntariness
because
the
officers
delayed
beyond
6
hours.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
a
policy
context
that
i
think
congress
has
decided
in
two
different
enactments,
and
i
think
that
if
this
court
were
to
reach
it
as
a
matter
of
policy,
it
should
revisit
the
balance
that
it
reached
in
mcnabb-mallory
because
of
the
changed
legal
context.
but
this
is
a
case
about
section
3501
and
about
federal
rule
of
evidence
402.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
am
glad
that
i
have
finally
reached
it.
[laughter]
section
3501
on
its
face
says
nothing
about
excluding
any
evidence.
what
it
says
is
that
in
section
(a),
voluntary
confessions
are
admissible.
in
section
(b),
it
says
that
in
determining
voluntariness,
a
court
will
consider
a
variety
of
factors
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
including
pre-arraignment
delay.
then
in
subsection
(c),
it
--
it
attacks
more
directly
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule.
and
as
originally
formulated
it
would
have
wiped
out
mcnabb-mallory
altogether.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
after
the
bill
was
introduced,
there
was
a
modification
of
it
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
in
which
a
6-hour
limitation
was
put
in.
now,
the
effect
of
that
6
hours
is
to
say
that
within
6
hours
after
the
arrest,
delay
by
itself
can
never
be
an
exclusive
grounds
for
suppression.
it
just
can't.
and
to
that
extent,
it
overrules
mcnabb-mallory,
to
the
extent
that
mcnabb-mallory
would
have
allowed
less
than
6
hours
of
delay
to
serve
as
a
basis
for
suppressing
evidence.
outside
of
6
hours,
it
does
not
say
that
evidence
is
suppressed.
it
simply
leaves
that
determination
to
other
sources
of
law.
in
the
government's
view,
the
primary
source
of
law
that
controls
the
answer
to
that
question
is
subsection
(a),
which
says
that
voluntary
confessions
are
admissible,
and
i
believe
that,
as
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--congress
never
needed
(c);
(c)
in
the
government's
view
was
always
superfluous,
even
at
the
time
when
it
directly
said
delays
shall
never
be
the
ground
for
suppressing
a
confession.
there
was
already
a
provision
in
(a)
that
said
voluntary
confessions
are
admissible,
and
it
was
well
understood
that
mcnabb-mallory
--
and
this
court
was
very
explicit
on
the
point
--
excluded
totally
voluntary
confessions.
so
if
this
court
has
nothing
before
it
but
the
text
of
the
statute,
subsection
(a)
makes
voluntary
confessions
admissible,
and
the
only
way
that
petitioner
can
get
around
that
is
to
say
that
section
3501(c)
carved
something
out
of
subsection
(a).
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
the
limitation
on
a
--
the
period
during
which
a
court
cannot
rely
exclusively
on
delay
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
it
--
it
carves
out
6
hours
from
mcnabb-mallory
plus
reasonable
transportation
delays,
and
it
leaves
the
6-hour
--
after
the
6-hour
period
to
other
sources
of
law.
now,
one
source
of
law
--
and
this
is
where
petitioner
looks
--
would
be
mcnabb-mallory.
but
mcnabb
--
mallory
is
not
a
constitutional
rule
of
decision.
this
court
has
been
clear,
most
recently
in
the
sanchez-llamas
decision,
that
it's
a
rule
of
supervisory
power
created
by
this
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
but
the
modification,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
i
think
congress
has
displaced
mcnabb-mallory.
it
obviously
cannot
overrule
a
decision
of
this
court,
but
it
can
prescribe
a
rule
of
law
that
takes
precedence
over
a
decision
of
this
court
that
rests
on
its
supervisory
power.
petitioner
does
not
contend
that
mcnabb-mallory
was
an
interpretation
of
rule
5
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
and
i
don't
think
that
he
could
do
that.
this
court
was
explicit
that
the
predecessor
statutes
that
existed
before
rule
5
and
provided
the
prompt-presentment
requirement
did
not
address
the
issue
of
remedy.
and
it's
notable,
i
think,
that
in
the
preliminary
draft
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
a
rule
of
exclusion
was
explicitly
provided.
the
rule
would
have
said,
no
statement
made
by
a
defendant
in
response
to
interrogation
by
an
officer
or
agent
of
the
government
shall
be
admissible
in
evidence
against
him
if
the
interrogation
occurs
while
the
defendant
was
held
in
custody
in
violation
of
this
rule.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that's
right,
justice
breyer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
breyer.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
there's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
that's
precisely
my
point,
justice
breyer.
the
other
rules
that
might
permit
exclusion
of
a
voluntary
confession
in
the
rules
of
evidence
are
explicit,
or
they're
there
because
the
courts
interpreted
that
rule
to
require
it.
that's
not
what
happened
in
mcnabb-mallory,
and
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
mcnabb
and
mallory
are
not
constitutional
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
were
attempts
to
effectuate
a
particular
policy
choice.
that
policy
choice
was
one
that
congress
was
free
to
revisit,
and
i
submit
it
did
revisit
in
two
different
provisions:
one
in
3501(a)
and
the
other
in
federal
rule
of
evidence
402.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
breyer,
and
i
--
i
will
concede
to
you
the
legislative
history
on
the
point
that
section
(a)
was
considered
to
overrule
miranda
and
subsection
(c)
was
addressed
to
mcnabb-mallory.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
in
theory
rule
403
is
such
a
rule.
rule
16,
which
requires
discovery
obligations,
contains
its
own
authorization
for
an
exclusionary
rule.
and
my
answer
to
justice
breyer
on
those
rules
is
that
they're
explicitly
provided
by
congress.
the
difference
in
a
rule
5--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
justice
alito.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
the
general
principle
is
what
the
court
ought
to
be
focused
on
here.
and
the
general
principle
is,
yes,
if
there's
some
specific
provision
that
should
be
read
together
with
subsection
(a)--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it
would
be
quite
extraordinary
for
the
court
to
decide
to
revive
its
supervisory
powers
decisions
in
mcnabb
and
mallory.
they
clearly
were
aimed
at
the
problem
of
incommunicado
detention
with
a
suspect
who
did
not
know
his
rights.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
the
statute,
as
we
read
it,
contains
some
overlap
in
voluntariness
requirement,
and
we
interpret
the
voluntariness
reference
in
subsection
(c)
to
really
mean
otherwise
voluntary;
in
other
words,
not
to
be
deemed
involuntary
solely
on
the
basis
of
delay,
but
otherwise
voluntary.
and
in
that
sense
section
3501(c)
does
contain--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
a
--
it's
a
limitation
on
the
time
during
which
a
judge
may
not
rely
on
delay
alone
to
find
a
confession
inadmissible.
that's
all
subsection
(c)
does.
it
says,
judge,
you
may
not
find
a
confession
to
be
inadmissible
solely
because
of
delay
if
it's
within
6
hours,
plus
reasonable
transportation
delays.
and
our
interpretation
of
that
language
is
that
the
inadmissibility,
as
you
mentioned,
justice
scalia,
refers
back
to
subsection
(a),
which
speaks
about
confessions
that
are
admissible
if
they're
voluntarily
given.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is,
and
i
think
the
reason
that
it
was
written
that
way,
justice
souter,
is
it
was
a
direct
attempt
to
make
clear
that
mcnabb-mallory
shall
not
operate
in
the
6-hour
period
after
arrests
and
before
presentment.
it
was
an
attempt
to
displace
mcnabb-mallory
explicitly.
originally
it
was
to
displace
it
altogether.
as
it
ended
up
being
written,
it
displaced
it
for
6
hours.
and
our
submission
is
that
you
read
the
rest
of
the
statute
to
determine
what
happens
to
confessions
that
are
taken
outside
of
6
hours.
and
i
would
recognize
that
this
makes
subsection
(c)
in
certain
respects
unnecessary
to
achieve
the
result
that
voluntariness
controls.
but
the
most
that
petitioner
argues
--
and
he
made
it
very
clear
today.
the
most
that
he
argues
is
that
section
3501(c)
leaves
mcnabb-mallory
to
live
another
day
for
confessions
outside
of
6
hours.
and
if
that
is
true,
then
the
government's
position
is
that
congress,
in
1975
in
rule
402
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
provided
the
bases
on
which
relevant
evidence
can
be
excluded.
and
it
listed
four
sources,
and
they
are
the
constitution,
an
act
of
congress,
a
rule
of
evidence,
or
--
and
this
is
the
relevant
one
--
other
rules
prescribed
by
the
supreme
court
pursuant
to
statutory
authority.
and
what
congress
meant
by
that
were
rules
that
this
court
promulgates
pursuant
to
rules
enabling
act
authority.
it
did
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
rule
5
is
certainly
prescribed
pursuant
to
rules
enabling
act
authority,
although
it
was
originally
enacted
by
congress.
but
rule
5
contains
no
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
is
a
crucial
difference
between
this
court
deciding
that
there
is
a
command
in
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
we
as
a
court
are
going
to
back
it
up
by
an
enforcement
mechanism,
which
is
the
supervisory
power
route,
and
congress
saying
what
we
intend
is
that
a
violation
of
this
rule
produced
inadmissibility
of
a
confession.
congress
has
never
said
the
latter.
this
court,
in
promulgating
rules
of
evidence,
has
never
said
the
latter.
and
what
that
leaves
the
court
with
is
the
option
of
persisting
in
mcnabb-mallory
as
a
supervisory
powers
decision
or
following
the
text
of
rule
402
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
which
says
that
there
isn't
any
authority
to
say
that
relevant
evidence
is
out
of
the
case
simply
because
of
the
court's
views
on
supervisory
powers--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
i
do,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
congress
focused
on
the
problem
of
confessions
in
section
3501
and
it
dealt
with
mcnabb-mallory
in
section
3501(c).
we
submit
that
the
text
of
the
statute
provides
an
answer
to
mcnabb-mallory
in
section
3501(a).
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
came
many
years
before,
justice
stevens.
in
1968,
when
congress
reacted
to
this
court's
miranda
decision
and
to
mcnabb-mallory,
it
passed
section
3501.
rule
402
is
a
very
general
rule
that
says
the
policy
of
the
federal
courts
is
that
we're
not
going
to
have
evidence
rules
made
any
more
by
case-by-case
decision
by
the
supreme
court.
we're
going
to
have
them
promulgated
in
a
--
in
a
code,
a
set
of
rules,
and
if
--
and
the
court
wants
to
change
them,
it
can
do
that
through
the
revisory
committee
process.
and
it
would
be
open
to
congress
at
any
point,
which
has
superior
ability
to
gather
facts
and
to
survey
the
impact
of
whether
there
is
a
pattern
of
violations
of
rule
5
that
warrants
the
very
strong--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
--
i
think
the
court
did
that
and
quite
properly
did
it,
justice
stevens,
because
rule
502
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
--
it's
501
or
502
--
says
that
principles
of
privilege
shall
be
developed
in
light
of
reason
and
experience,
and
so
it
was
a
specific
grant
to
this
court
of
the
authority
to
do
that.
but
beyond
that,
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
court
use
supervisory
powers
to
exclude
relevant
evidence.
there's
a
rulemaking
process.
if
the
bench
and
bar
want
to
get
together
and
conclude
as
they
did
not
conclude
in
1943
--
this
is
a
point
i
was
trying
to
make
to
justice
breyer.
in
1943,
after
this
court's
decision
in
mcnabb,
there
was
explicit
consideration
of
an
exclusionary
rule
provision
in
rule
5.
it
engendered
enormous
controversy.
it
was
rejected.
it
was
taken
out
of
the
rule,
and
it
was
never
promulgated.
so
mcnabb-mallory
exists
not
by
virtue
of
the
rulemaking
process
but
by
virtue
of
a
supervisory
decision
of
this
court
more
than
half
a
century
ago
in
an
entirely
different
legal
climate,
in
a
climate
where
the
costs
of
excluding
a
reliable,
probative
confession
were
not
balanced
against
the
benefits,
if
any,
to
be
achieved
by
enforcing
of
the
prompt-present
requirement
through
exclusion.
since
that
time,
this
court's
miranda
jurisprudence
has
made
it
far
more
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
conclude
that
the
enforcement
of
a
rule-based
mechanism
which
serves
as
a
prophylaxis
to
protect
voluntariness
should
now
result
in
exclusion
of
a
confession
when
section
3501
says
voluntary
confessions
come
in
and
section
--
and
rule
402
says
that
relevant
evidence
comes
in
unless
excluded
by
four
sources--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
i
--
justice
ginsburg,
the
rules
advisory
committee
notes,
i
think,
reflect
an
expectation
that
mcnabb-mallory
was
the
law.
our
submission
is
that
the
text
of
402
is
simply
inconsistent
with
that,
because
it's
quite
explicit
in
limiting
the
sources
of
rules
that
can
bar
the
admission
of
relevant
evidence.
and
the
phrase
that's
--
that's
in
rule
402,
which
is
on
page
29
of
our
brief,
is
"rules
prescribed
by
the
supreme
court
pursuant
to
statutory
authority.
"
now,
the
advisory
committee
drafters
may
have
thought
that
that
subsumed
rule
5,
but
i
think
that's
a
legal
question
for
this
court,
and
the
correct
answer
to
that
is
mcnabb-mallory
is
a
rule
of
supervisory
power,
not
a
rule
promulgated
by
this
court.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you.
