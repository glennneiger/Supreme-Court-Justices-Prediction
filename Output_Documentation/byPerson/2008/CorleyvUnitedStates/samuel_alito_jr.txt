justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
arguing
that
the
language
in
subsection
(c)
codifies
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
there's
a
very
big
difference,
isn't
there,
between
saying
we're
codifying
this
rule,
we're
making
it
a
statutory
requirement,
and
saying,
assuming
that
this
supervisory
rule
that
was
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
remains
in
place,
we're
creating
an
exception
to
it?
which
of
those
two
things
does
--
does
subsection
(c)
do?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
they
have
that
textual
problem,
but
you
have
at
least
an
equally
big
textual
problem
because
you
want
to
read
the
first
sentence
of
subsection
(a)
completely
out
of
the
statute
based
on
some
supposition
about
what
congress
was
intending
to
do.
so
really,
you
know,
if
you
live
by
the
text,
you
die
by
the
text.
i
don't
see
how
you're
going
to
succeed
with
a
subsection
(c)
textual
analysis
if
you're
going
to
disregard
the
text
of
subsection
(a).
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
you
read
subsection
(c)
the
way
you
do,
it
makes
subsection
(a)
mean
something
quite
different
from
what
it
says
literally.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
now
what
you're
--
you
are
not
arguing
that
there
is
a
specific
provision
that
controls
a
general
provision.
you
are
arguing
that
an
arguable
negative
inference
from
an
arguably
more
specific
provision
reads
new
language
into
the
text
of
a
specific
provision.
that's
what
you're
arguing,
isn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
that
be
the
case?
the
confession
could
still
be
suppressed
on
grounds
of
involuntariness?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
your
argument
is
you
don't
trust
district
judges
to
make
accurate
determinations
as
to
whether
the
confession
is
voluntary
or
not.
you
need
--
you
need
a
rule
that
takes
that
out
of
their
hands.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
requirement
of
prompt
presentment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
dreeben,
justice
breyer
suggested
that
there
are
rules
of
evidence
other
than
those
based
on
the
constitution
or
mcnabb-mallory
that
might
result
in
the
exclusion
of
a
confession.
maybe
there
are
such
rules,
but
i'm
trying
to
think
of
them.
i
can't
think
of
what
they
might
be.
certainly
it's
not
hearsay.
it's
--
is
it
ever
going
to
be
ruled
to
be
irrelevant?
is
it
common
for
a
confession
to
be
excluded
under
rule
403?
are
there
rules
that
would--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--have
you
--
are
you
familiar
with
cases
in
which
a
defendant's
confession
has
been
excluded
under
--
under
403?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
a
defendant
waive
the
right,
the
5(a)
right?
