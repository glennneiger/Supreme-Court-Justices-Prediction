justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this?
what
other
remedy,
other
than
suppression
of
the
confession
made
after
the
6
hours,
is
there
available
to
the
defendants
to
enforce
the
interest
in
prompt
presentment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
had
--
had
one
question.
did
you
think
the
--
the
d.c.
circuit
--
the
statute
pertaining
to
the
district
of
columbia
is
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
before
you
get
to
those,
mr.
dreeben?
other
than
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule,
what
was
available
as
a
sanction
for
violations
of
the
rule
of
prompt
presentment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
not
--
apart
from
an
evidentiary
sanction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
at
the
time
that
mallory
and
mcnabb
were
decided,
the
court
thought
that
an
extra
rule
was
necessary
to
give
the
government
an
incentive
to
comply
with
prompt-presentment
requirements.
the
very
same
factors
are
still
at
work
today,
aren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
not
--
we're
not
talking
about
a
constitutional
problem
but
a
rule
problem
encouraging
compliance
with
the
--
the
--
with
the
rule
that
requires
prompt
presentment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
the
extent
that
--
i'm
suggesting
to
the
extent
that
that
was
a
motivating
factor
in
mcnabb,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
precisely
the
same
motivating
factor
in
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
the
sole,
but
--
but
to
the
extent
it
was
a
motivating
factor,
that
seems
--
it
would
have
equal
strength
today
as
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
still
true
they
have
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose
by
continuing
to
interrogate
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
--
if
they
don't
get
the
confession
within
6
hours,
they
haven't
got
it.
so
if
they
continue
on,
their
only
purpose
is
to
try
and
get
a
voluntary
confession.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
doesn't,
mr.
dreeben.
what
do
the
words
"time
limitation"
mean
in
the
proviso?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben,
do
you
think
the
rule
402
argument
is
strong
enough
to
prevail
even
the
section
--
the
statute
had
never
been
enacted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statute
was
really
unnecessary
to
overrule
mcnabb
and
mallory,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
was
a
superfluous
and
unnecessary
answer
if
your
interpretation
of
the
rule
is
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
could
never
acknowledge
--
never
recognize
a
new
privilege,
then,
for
example--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--from
psychiatrists
or
something
like
that.
