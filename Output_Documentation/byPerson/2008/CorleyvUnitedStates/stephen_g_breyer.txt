g.

what
is
the
--
what
if
the
other
reasons
apply?
i
take
it
the
words
(e)
means
any
adverse
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
we
exclude
evidence.
you
know,
i
mean
--
it
might
--
for
example,
might
not
in
the
circumstance
be
worth
the
confusion.
it
might
not
in
the
circumstance
be
worth
the
time.
it
might
violate
--
i
don't
know,
there
are
like
a
whole
--
so
there
are
many
reasons.
so
in
your
opinion,
does
section
(a)
mean
to
set
aside
all
the
reasons?
in
other
words,
if
for
some
other
reason
this
particular
piece
of
self-incriminating
evidence,
adverse
evidence
obtained
after
30
hours,
violated
the
admission,
violated
some
totally
different
rule
of
evidence,
is
your
opinion
does
(a)
mean,
judge,
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
triple
hearsay
or
it
doesn't
matter
if
it
violates
some
authentication
requirement,
it
doesn't
matter
if
it
violates
--
you
know,
it
has
to
be
relevant,
pertinent,
not
a
waste
of
time.
it
doesn't
matter;
admit
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
of
course
it
doesn't
mean
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
it
doesn't
mean
that,
then
why
does
it
mean
that
we
should
ignore
this
other
rule
of
evidence
contained
in
rule
5
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
are
--
there
are,
in
other
words,
as
you've
heard,
a
number
of
things
that
can
happen
when
you
hold
a
person,
let's
say,
for
40
hours
or
29.
i
mean,
one
thing
that
happens
is
he
doesn't
learn
how
he
gets
out
on
bail.
another
thing
that
happens
is
he
doesn't
learn
exactly
what
the
charge
is
against
him.
another
thing
--
you
know,
they're
all
listed
in
--
in
rule
5.
and
--
and
when
you
have
an
exclusionary
rule,
you
enforce
not
only
what
you're
talking
about,
which
i
understand,
which
is
the
voluntariness
part,
but
you
also
enforce
all
these
other
things
that
happen
when
you
bring
a
person
before
a
magistrate
and
don't
keep
him
for
70
hours
or
something.
so
--
so
why
should
we
interpret
(a)
as
setting
those
other
things
aside
and
requiring
us
to
overturn
mcnabb
and
mallory?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
of
course
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
say
anything
in
the
legislative
history,
which
interests
me,
that
the
purpose
of
(a)
is
to
overturn
mallory
and
mcnabb?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
realize
i
wasn't
focusing
on
the
word
"confession".
i
was
focusing
on
the
words
in
(e),
which
were
"any
self-incriminating
statement".
and
that's
why
i
asked
you
if
you
interpreted
that
to
include
anything
that
the
individual
said
after,
say,
29
hours
that
might
turn
out
to
be
adverse
to
that
defendant's
interests.
and
your
answer
to
that
was
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
think
you're
right.
i
think
we
agree
on
that.
so,
if
the
defendant
said,
if
you
look
under
the
rock,
you
will
find
the
writing
such-and-such,
it
might
not
be
authenticated
for
that
particular
writing.
there
are
many
reasons.
it
might
be
triple
hearsay,
what
he
says.
i
mean,
you
know,
there
are
a
variety
of
things,
aren't
there?
i
don't
know.
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
i
brought
that
up
is
not
to
be
technical.
the
reason
i
brought
it
up
is
to
point
out
that
there
are
many,
many
words
that
a
person
could
utter
in
confinement
under
30
hours,
which
in
a
variety
of
ways
could
stab
him
in
the
back
without
it
having
anything
to
do
with
miranda,
without
it
having
anything
to
do
with
coerced
confessions.
and
similarly,
there
are
many
reasons
for
bringing
him
forward
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
either.
and
therefore,
i
wonder
if
all
those
reasons
could
support
retaining
mcnabb-mallory,
a
matter
about
which
congress
said
nothing.
