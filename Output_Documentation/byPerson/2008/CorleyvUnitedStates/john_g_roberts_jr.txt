chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
07-10441,
corley
v.
united
states.
mr.
mccolgin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
it
may
just
mean
that
the
confessions
beyond
6
hours
may
be
excluded
solely
because
of
delay.
in
other
words,
if
a
judge
says,
look,
i
don't
want
to
hear
about
all
this
other
stuff,
it's
just
too
long,
he
can
--
he
can't
do
that
beyond
the
6
hours,
but
he
can
within
the
6
hours.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.

chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
mccolgin,
you
have
4
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
may
not
have
been
intended
to
do
that,
but
doesn't
its
language
on
its
face
cover
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that
--
that
sort
of
flagrant
conduct
would
not
be
an
issue
if
this
had
been
done
within
6
hours,
right,
assuming
that
it
was
a
voluntary
confession?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
purpose
of
the
law
enforcement
officers,
if
it's
voluntary,
is
irrelevant
under
6
hours.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
doesn't
it
seem
odd
to
focus
on
flagrant
conduct
at
6:01
as
being
as
important
as
you're
emphasizing,
but
not
--
but
totally
irrelevant
at
5:59?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-10441,
corley
versus
united
states,
which
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
