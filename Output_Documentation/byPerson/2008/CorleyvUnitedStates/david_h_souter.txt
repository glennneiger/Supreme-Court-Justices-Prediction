justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
was
--
why
was
it
appropriate
to
have
a
special
rule
for
transportation?
in
other
words,
everything
that's
covered
by
the
transportation
proviso
would,
on
your
theory,
have
been
subject
to
consideration
under
mcnabb-mallory
anyway.
so
why
didn't
they
simply
have
a
6-hour
rule
and
leave
any
exceptions,
transportation,
unavailability
of
magistrate,
medical
emergency,
whatever,
to
--
to
the
leeway
that
mcnabb-mallory
allows?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
basically
--
i
don't
mean
this
disparagingly.
basically
the
answer
is
politics.
justice
david
h.
souter
somebody
from
a
state
thought
of
it
and
nobody
else
said,
well,
gee,
let's
pile
on
some
other
express
provisos.
it's
as
simple
as
that
in
your
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
there
a
--
a
new
factor,
now
that
the
court
has
decided
miranda?
and
you've
argued
that
we
should
regard
this
in
the
post-miranda
light,
but
i
think
there's
at
least
one
way
of
doing
that
that
cuts
against
the
government's
argument
and
i'd
like
your
response
to
that.
that
is
that
in
the
post-miranda
world
in
practical
terms,
if
a
--
if
a
court,
in
considering
a
suppression
motion,
finds
that
the
miranda
warnings
were
given
and
that
after
they
were
given
this
individual
said,
okay,
i'll
talk,
that
is
in
practical
terms
the
end
of
the
issue.
the
notion
that
there
is
a
--
an
independent
voluntariness
concern
is
pretty
much
theory,
not
practice.
given
what
i
think
is
the
--
kind
of
the
realworld
effect
of
miranda
--
say
the
magic
words,
get
the
defendant
to
say,
i'll
talk,
that's
it
--
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
have
a
further
safeguard
in
something
like
the
6-hour
rule
understood
as
preserving
mcnabb-mallory
after
the
6
hours?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
agree
with
you.
it
is
an
issue
of
policy.
but
i
--
i
thought
your
whole
argument
for
considering
this
as
a
post-miranda
case
was,
in
effect,
a
--
a
policy
context
in
which
you
wanted
us
to
decide
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's
the
answer,
why
do
we
need
(c)?
i
mean,
why
did
congress
need
(c)
at
all?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
didn't
the
statute
say,
instead
of
saying
inadmissible,
shall
not
be
found
involuntary
solely
by
reasons
of
delay?
because
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
equating
the
two.
