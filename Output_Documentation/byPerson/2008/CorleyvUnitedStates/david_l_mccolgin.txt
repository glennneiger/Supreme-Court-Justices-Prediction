mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
fbi
agents
delayed
presenting
mr.
corley
to
a
federal
magistrate
judge
in
order
to
obtain
his
two
confessions.
the
admissibility
of
these
two
confessions
depends
on
an
issue
of
statutory
interpretation.
it's
the
interpretation
of
3501(c),
together
with
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
and
the
right
of
prompt
presentment.
now,
there's
two
critical
issues
i
would
like
to
address.
the
first
is
that
3501(c),
as
it's
written
by
congress,
leaves
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
in
place
outside
the
6-hour
time
limitation.
and
the
second
is
that
the
government's
interpretation,
under
which
3501(c)
is
merely
a
voluntariness
safe
harbor,
is
unfaithful
to
the
text
and
the
structure
of
the
statute.
turning
to
the
first
point,
subsection
(c)
modifies
mcnabb-mallory,
but
does
not
eliminate
it.
the
exact
text
of
the
statute
here
is
crucial.
and
for
the
court's
convenience,
on
page
7
of
the
yellow
brief,
the
operative
language
of
the
--
of
the
text
of
the
statute
is
set
out.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
this
court
could,
but
for
several
prudential
reasons,
this
court
should
not
overturn
mcnabb
and
mallory
and
should
not
find
them
to
be
no
longer
valid
considerations.
first
of
all
--
or
no
longer
valid
precedent.
first
of
all,
the
solicitor
general's
office
has
not
asked
that
mcnabb
and
mallory
be
overturned.
second
of
all,
the
parties
haven't
briefed
that
issue.
it's
been
briefed
instead
as
a
statutory
interpretation
issue.
thirdly,
congress
through
3501(c)
structured
the
statute
on
the
existing
precedent
of
mcnabb
and
mallory,
and
at
this
point,
for
the
court
to
pull
mcnabb
and
mallory
out
from
underneath
that
structure,
it
would
cause
that
structure
to
basically
collapse.
it
depends.
the
6-hour
time
limitation
depends
on
the
existence
of
mcnabb-mallory
outside
that
6-hour
time
period.
congress
can
revisit
this
issue
at
any
time.
their
hands
are
not
tied.
congress
could
choose
to
change
3501(c)
so
that
it
no
longer
provides
for
mcnabb-mallory
outside
the
6-hour
time
period.
but
that's
a
decision
for
congress,
and
this
court,
i
would
suggest
respectfully,
should
respect
the
--
the
prerogatives
and
the
--
the
policy
choice
that
congress
has
already
made.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
i
--
i'm
arguing
that
the
exact
language,
whether
it
is
"codification"
or
"leaves
intact",
doesn't
matter.
what
it
does
is
it--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--your
honor,
it
does
the
latter.
it
leaves
mcnabb-mallory
in
place.
however,
the
language
of
the
statute
uses
the
phrase
"time
limitation"
in
the
proviso.
"time
limitation"
implies
more
than
we're
just
not
just
touching
mcnabb-mallory
for
the
time
being.
it
depends
--
the
statute
depends
on
mcnabb-mallory
to
create
the
time
limitation,
because
without
mcnabb-mallory
there
is
no
limitation.
after
the
6
hours,
nothing
else
happens
unless
mcnabb-mallory--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--well,
but
again,
the
language
of
the
statute
is
"time
limitation".
that's
strong
language
for
congress
to
use,
and
it
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
limit
the
taking
of
confessions
to
those
first
6
hours.
there
is
no
limitation
without
mcnabb-mallory
in
effect.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
i'm
not
actually
saying
that
congress
has
taken
away
the
authority
of
the
court.
i'm
saying
as
a
prudential
manner,
since
congress
can
address
this
on
its
own
and
since
it
structured
the
statute
on
the
foundation
of
mcnabb-mallory,
it
would
be
best
for
this
court
to
leave
up
to
congress
that
policy
choice.
congress
chose
in
1968
to
leave
the
mcnabb
--
mallory
protection
against
presentment
delay
in
place
after
6
hours.
it
was
a
compromise,
and
it
was
an
appropriate
compromise,
because
what
it
did
was
it
cut
out
the
first
6
hours
during
which
there
had
been
the
most
problems
with
the
application
of
mcnabb-mallory.
the
6-hour
time
limitation
effectively
lowers
the
social
costs
of
this
--
of
this
rule
of
this
rule
of
inadmissibility
while
maintaining
the
deterrent
effect
of
mcnabb-mallory
outside
the
6
hours.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
yes,
your
honor.
on
page
7,
i've
set
out
the
operative
language
of
the
statute.
and
what
the
statute
actually
provides
is
that
a
confession
shall
not
be
inadmissible
solely
because
of
delay
if
such
confession
is
found
by
the
trial
judge
to
have
been
made
voluntarily
and
made
within
6
hours
of
arrest.
now,
the
phrase
"inadmissible
solely
because
of
delay"
is
clearly
a
reference
to
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
because
that's
exactly
what
mcnabb-mallory
does.
it
renders
the
confession
inadmissible
solely
because
of
delay
if
the
delay
in
presentment
was
unreasonable.
so
what
the
statute
is
providing
on
its
face
is
that
a
confession
shall
not
be
subject
to
the
mcnabb
--
mallory
rule
if
it's
voluntarily
given
and
made
within
6
hours.
the
6-hour
provision
means
that
mcnabb-mallory
is,
in
effect,
outside
of
the
6
hours.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
within
the
6
hours,
he
cannot
exclude
solely
because
of
delay,
even
a
voluntary
statement.
that
is
the
mcnabb-mallory
principle,
inadmissible
solely
because
of
delay.
so
what
it's
saying
is
that
mcnabb-mallory
does
not
apply
within
the
6
hours.
now,
the
government's
interpretation
is
that
this
is
simply
a
voluntariness
safe
harbor,
and
what
they
do
is
they
read
the
word
"inadmissible"
as
being
synonymous
with
the
word
"involuntary".
but
the
text
of
the
statute
shows
that
those
two
terms
are
not
synonymous,
because
the
text
of
the
statute
says
that
in
order
for
a
confession
to
be
admissible
it
must
be
voluntary
and
made
within
6
hours.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
your
honor,
we
don't
disregard
the
text
of
subsection
(a).
instead,
we
just
applied
the
principle
that
a
general
provision
--
if
it
conflicts
with
a
specific
provision,
the
specific
controls
over
the
general.
what
we
have
in
subsection
(a)
is
a
general
statement
that
voluntary
statements
are
admissible.
but
if
we
read
that
the
way
the
government
does,
as
making
admissible
every
voluntary
statement,
then
that
would
make
subsection
(c)
completely
superfluous.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
no.
it
simply
establishes
a
--
an
exception
in
the
area
of
delay.
and
this
is
the
way
statutes
work.
when
there
is
a
conflict
between
a
general
provision
and
a
specific
one,
the
specific
must
control
over
the
general.
if
it
worked
the
other
way
around,
it
would
render
the
specific
superfluous.
so
this
has
happened
in
--
in
statutes
in
numerous
cases.
in
1983
versus
2254,
it
was
held
that
2254
as
a
specific
provision
controls
over
1983.
so
this
is
a
--
an
accepted
principle
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
with
respect,
no,
your
honor.
we're
not
making
the
negative
inference
argument
that
the
government
suggests
we're
making
in
the
first
part
of
their
brief.
instead,
we're
making
the
argument
that
subsection
(c)
was
constructed
on
the
existing
precedent
of
mcnabb
and
mallory,
which
already
established
a
rule
of
inadmissibility.
subsection
(c)
then
just
carves
out
the
first
6
hours
from
that.
so
it's
not
creating
a
rule
of
inadmissibility
by
negative
influence
--
inference.
rather,
it's
just
recognizing
that
a
rule
of
inadmissibility
already
exists
in
the
--
in
the
case
law,
and
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
simply
carve
out
from
the
first
6
hours
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule.
the
government--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--that,
again,
is
the
government's
interpretation.
but
it
requires
a
rewriting.
it
requires
reading
subsection(c)
as
a
voluntariness
safe
harbor.
but
congress
used
the
word
"inadmissible"
deliberately.
that's
a
reference
to
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule.
mcnabb-mallory
did
not
render
confessions
voluntary
or
involuntary
based
on
delay.
it
rendered
them
inadmissible.
so
that
language
is
crucial.
this
cannot
be
read
as
a
voluntariness
safe
harbor.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
yes,
your
honor.
and
(c)
makes
clear
that,
at
least
for
purposes
of
subsection
(c),
voluntariness
is
not
enough
for
admissibility,
because
it
says
on
its
face
that
in
order--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--so
the
two
terms--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--your
honor,
because
the
effect
is,
again,
to
allow
for
a
confession
to
be
inadmissible
solely
based
on
delay
if
it's
outside
of
the
6
hours.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
well,
what
the
--
what
the
congress
said
was
that
delay
alone
cannot
be
a
basis
for
inadmissibility
within
6
hours.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
that
leaves
in
place
mcnabb
--
mallory,
under
which
delay
alone
is
a
basis
for
inadmissibility.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
but
that--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--your
honor,
that
depends.
the
premise
of
that
depends
on
the
argument
that
(c),
and
(c).
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
well,
as
used
in
subsection--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--yes,
your
honor.
however,
as
used
in
subsection
(c),
that
should
control,
because
the
word
"inadmissibility"
is
being
used
in
that
very
same
sentence.
since
the
very
same
sentence
makes
clear
that
"voluntariness"
is
not
enough
for
"admissibility",
it's
clear
that
those
two
terms
are
not
synonymous.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
yes.
it
protects--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--yes,
your
honor.
it
protects--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--it's
protecting--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--it's
protecting
the
right
of
prompt
presentment.
mcnabb-mallory
was
meant
to
prevent
the
exploitation
of
delay
in
presentment
as
a
means
of
obtaining
a
confession.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
well,
voluntariness
is
certainly
a
part
of
it.
but
it's
in
addition,
because
there's
rights
that
attach
at
presentment
that
allow
a
defendant
to
make
a
much
more
informed
decision
as
to
whether--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--because
the
confession
itself
was
obtained
through
exploitation
of
the
delay.
during
a
period
of
custody,
before
presentment,
the
defendant
is
just
in
the
hands
of
the
zealous
police
officers
who
have
actually
arrested
him.
it's
a
fundamental
principle
of
our
justice
system
that
that
period
should
be
as
short
as
reasonably
possible
because
during
that
period,
as
time
goes
on,
the
effect
of
the
delay
is
to
increase
the
inherently
coercive
powers
of
that
time
period.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
exactly,
your
honor.
it's
the
--
the
right
under
5(a)
to
prompt
presentment
that
is
being
protected.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
well,
the
purpose
of
mcnabb
--
mallory
was
actually
to
cut
the
line
a
bit
short
of
having
to
actually
make
a
voluntariness
determination.
it's
a
recognition
that
even
if
the
statement
is
voluntary,
that
still
there
are
inherent
coercive
pressures
that
develop
during
a
period
of
presentment
--
of
presentment
delay,
and
that
that
period
of
time
should
be
as
short
as
possible
so
that
that
coercive
nature,
the
coercive
nature
of
the
interrogation,
doesn't
cause
the
person
to
waive
rights.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
it's
--
yes,
your
honor.
not
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
coerced
confession.
i'm
not
arguing
that
this
was
involuntary.
instead,
i'm
arguing
that
mcnabb-mallory
intends
to
avoid
the
voluntariness
requirement
by
establishing
a
prophylactic
rule,
so
that
a
presentment
needs
to
be
made
as
soon
as
reasonably
possible
after
the
arrest
so
that
that
delay
cannot
be
exploited
as
a
means
of
obtaining
a
confession.
it
both
protects
the
right
to
prompt
presentment
and
it
also--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--there
is
no
other
remedy
available.
in
fact,
the
message
that
an
affirmance
in
this
case
would
send
to
law
enforcement
is
that
delay
for
the
purpose
of
interrogation
is
permissible
and
that
the
right
of
prompt
presentment
is
unenforceable.
without
mcnabb
--
mallory,
this
becomes
an
empty
right.
there
is
no
other
remedy.
and
that's
why,
particularly
where
the
delay
is
purposeful,
as
we
have
in
this
case--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
it's
not
that
we
don't
trust
them.
it's
that
delay
for
the
purpose
of
interrogation
should
not
be
pushed
to
that
limit;
that
delay
for
the
purpose
of
interrogation
should
not
be
permitted.
the
delay,
particularly
where
it's
for
that
express
purpose,
even
if
the
defendant
cannot
show
that
it
rose
to
the
level
of
involuntariness
--
still
it's
exploitation
of
delay.
it's
a
violation
of
the
right
to
prompt
presentment,
and
that
violation
of
the
right
to
prompt
presentment
under
mcnabb-mallory
renders
that
confession--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--the
purpose
of
the
right
of
prompt
presentment
is
several-fold.
first
of
all,
it's
because
there
are
inherent
coercive
characteristics
that
develop
during
a
period
of
custody,
and
a
person,
once
arrested,
should
be
presented
to
a
neutral
magistrate
so
that
a
neutral
magistrate
can
both
assign
counsel,
give
an
opportunity
for
consultation
with
counsel,
and
can
also
inform
the
person
of
his
rights,
address
bail,
and
issues
such
as
that.
so
the
right
of
prompt
presentment
is
considered
fundamental.
it's
considered
a
basic
right,
a
basic
statutory
right,
in
our
system.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
we
have
to
remember,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--no,
your
honor,
that's
not
our
position.
our
position
is
that
the
first
question
is,
did
the
confession
fall
within
that
6-hour
time
period?
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
or
longer,
depending
on
transportation,
means
of
transportation.
for
that
determination
of
whether
it
falls
within
the
exclusion
period,
only
means
of
transportation
or
distance
is
considered,
but
once
the
confession
is
outside
that
period,
then
mcnabb-mallory
applies
and
the
confession
may
still
be
admissible
if
the
delay
was
necessary.
and
for
those
purposes,
once
we're
determining
whether
mcnabb-mallory
requires
inadmissibility,
the
court
can
consider,
for
example,
emergency
hospital
treatment
or
unavailability
of
the
magistrate.
so
all
of
those
factors
can
and
do
get
considered
once
we
get
into
the
determination
of
whether
mcnabb-mallory
requires
exclusion.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
not
at
all,
your
honor,
because
once
we
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute,
what
it's
doing
is
carving
out
the
first
6
hours
from
mcnabb-mallory.
so
the
determination
of
whether
we're
in
that
carve-out
period
is
limited
to
transportation
and
distance,
but
once
we're
outside
of
it,
we
just
apply
mcnabb-mallory,
and
that's
mcnabb-mallory
as
it's
developed
in
the
case
law,
which
includes
all
of
these
other
considerations.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
because
the
first
question,
again,
is
just
whether
to
exclude
the
confession
altogether
from
the
mcnabb-mallory
determination.
and
for
those
purposes,
they
--
some
senators
from
larger
states
where
there's
greater
distances
to
travel
wanted
to
make
sure
that
there
was
an
exception
for
transportation
and
distance.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
exactly,
your
honor.
there's
very
little
comment
on
it.
it's
added
at
the
--
at
the
last
minute.
the
scott
amendment
had
just
included
the
6hour
provision,
but
then
the
proviso
was
added
on
the
floor
at
the
very
last
minute.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
your
honor,
the
government
also
relies
on
402
as
a
basis
for
arguing
that
mcnabb-mallory
has
been
basically
overturned
by
congress.
rule
402,
however,
clearly
does
not
apply
here.
the
advisory
notes
--
the
advisory
committee
notes
made
clear
that
rule
402
was
never
intended
to
overturn
mcnabb-mallory.
in
fact,
the
advisory
committee
notes
identify
mcnabb-mallory
as
a
rule
--
a
rule
of
inadmissibility
that
was
meant
to
stay
in
place
even
after
the
implementation
of
rule
402.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
mclaughlin
principle
that
less
than
48
hours
is
presumptively
reasonable.
however,
congress
in
--
in
3501(c)
chose
to
set
a
6-hour
time
period
for
the
taking
of
confessions
and
to
leave
mcnabb-mallory
in
place
outside
that
time
period.
i
would
suggest
that
congress
struck
an
appropriate
balance
at
that
time,
keeping
mcnabb-mallory
in
place
for
the
more
extreme
types
of
delay,
but
eliminating
it
from
the
shorter
periods
of
delay.
in
doing
so,
congress
struck
an
appropriate
balance,
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
should
respect
the
balance
that
congress
has
struck.
unless
there's
any
further
questions,
i
would
ask
the--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--as
legislative
history,
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
3501(c)
was
modeled
on
the
d.c.
legislation,
which
established
clearly
a
3-hour
time
period.
and
the
legislative
history
for
that
is
very
clear
that
it
intended
to
leave
mcnabb-mallory
in
effect
outside
that
time
period.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
no
further
questions?
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
thank
you,
your
honor.
rule
402,
as
it
was
enacted,
clearly
was
not
intended
to
overturn
existing
rules
of
inadmissibility
such
as
mcnabb-mallory.
we
know
that
because
the
advisory
committee
notes
specifically
identify
it
as
a
rule
of
inadmissibility
that
would
survive
after
rule
402.
it
was--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--not
at
all,
because
it
was
statutorily
based
and
it
was
viewed
as
being
statutorily
based
because
it
was
it
was
based
on
the
existing
statutes
at
the
time
of
mcnabb
which
were
seen
as
precluding
presentment
delay.
and
then
after
the
enactment
of
--
of
rule
5(a),
it
was
seen
as
based
on
that
as
well.
after
--
in
1968,
mallory
was
also
seen
as
being
incorporated
into
3501(c),
which
is
clear
from
the
citation
in
the
advisory
note
to
both
mallory
and
3501(c).
so
it
was
viewed,
when
it
was
enacted,
as
leaving
in
place
mcnabb-mallory,
because
mcnabb-mallory
was
viewed
as
being
pursuant
to
statutory
authority
--
pursuant
to
statutory
authority
because
it
was
enforcing
statutory
rights.
so
rule
402
clearly
does
not
in
any
way
overturn
mcnabb
--
mallory.
i'd
like
to
address
very
quickly
the
miranda
issue
and
note
that,
you
know,
certainly,
although
miranda
came
into
effect
after
mcnabb-mallory,
miranda
itself
in
rule
32
notes
that
the
existence
of
the
miranda
warnings
should
not
be
seen
as
a
basis
for
disregarding
the
rights
under
mcnabb
and
mallory
and
the
importance
of
that
exclusionary
rule.
so
miranda
itself
recognized
that
it
was
still
important
to
have
a
protection
against
presentment
delay.
and
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
illustrate
that
very
well.
we
have
in
this
case
a
flagrant
and
deliberate
violation
of
the
right
of
prompt
presentment,
where
the
agents
admitted
freely
that
they
delayed
the
presentment
in
order
to
obtain
the
confessions.
if
--
again,
if
the
third
circuit
were
to
be
affirmed
in
this
case,
it
would
be
telling
law
enforcement
around
the
country
that
that
sort
of
flagrant
conduct
is
permissible.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
that's
correct.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
as
long
as
it
is
under
6
hours,
that's
correct.
there's
no
problem,
and
that's
because
if
it's
within
6
hours,
there's
no
delay.
the
congress
has
determined
that
anything
less
than
6
hours
is
not
within--
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
--there
has
to
be
line-drawing
in
this
sort
of
case.
so
when
you
get
close
to
the
line,
you
may
have
results
that
are
dramatically
different.
in
this
case,
we're
far
outside
the
line.
the
second
confession
was
26
and
a
half
hours
after
the
arrest.
and
as
i
have
noted
and
as
--
as
this
court
has
noted,
it
was
a
deliberate
delay
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
the
confessions.
where
we
have
such
purposeful
delay,
congress
left
mcnabb-mallory
in
place
to
address
precisely
such
flagrant
conduct.
mr.
david
l.
mccolgin
yes,
your
honor,
as
long
as
it
is
waived
within
the
6-hour
time
period,
and
as
long
as
it's
an
express
waiver
of
the
right
to
a
prompt
presentment,
it
can
be
waived.
in
this
case,
of
course,
there
was
no
waiver.
there
wasn't
even
a
miranda
waiver
until
well
--
well
after
the
6
hours.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
your
honor.
