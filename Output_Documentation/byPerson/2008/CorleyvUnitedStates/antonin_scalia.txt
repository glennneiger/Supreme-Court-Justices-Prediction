why
--
why
can't
you
argue
that
what
happens
when
you're
not
within
the
safe
harbor
is
simply
that
the
time
period
cannot
alone
govern?
all
right?
but
it
can
still
be
part
of
the
list
of
things
that
can
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
voluntariness
under
(b).
why
doesn't
that
reconcile
the
two
provisions?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
3501
itself:
(a)
says
that
it
shall
--
shall
be
admissible
in
evidence
if
it's
voluntarily
given;
and
(b)
says
what
factors
will
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
it's
voluntarily
given.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree.
i
agree
with
that.
it
is
not
alone
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
if
you're
outside
of
that
safe
harbor,
you
cannot
rely
upon
the
time
alone.
but
why
can't
you
rely
on
the
time
plus
the
other
factors?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
it's
not
being
admissible
solely
on
the
basis
of
--
i'm
sorry.
delay
is
not
the
only
factor
being
--
being
considered
in
the
--
in
making
the
inadmissibility
call.
delay
is
one
of
the
things;
whereas,
within
the
safe
harbor,
delay
can't
be
taken
into
account
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it
--
it
leaves
it
in
effect
only
if
you
ignore
(a)
and
(b).
(a)
says
that
it's
admissible
if
it's
voluntary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
(b)
says
it's
voluntary
if
you
take
into
account
the
--
the
five
factors,
one
of
which
is
the
period
of
time
before
arraignment.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
are
synonymous
as
used
in
(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
(a)
says
that
if
it's
--
it's
admissible
if
it's
voluntary.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mccolgin,
what
do
you
do
with
the
problem
that
the
proviso
only
makes
a
delay
longer
than
--
than
6
hours
nondestructive
of
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
if
this
--
the
delay
beyond
6
hours
is
found
by
the
trial
judge
to
be
reasonable
considering
the
means
of
transportation
and
the
distance
to
be
traveled
to
the
nearest
available
magistrate
judge
or
other
officer?
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
reasons
why
you
can't
do
it
within
6
hours
other
than
the
means
of
transportation
and
the
distance
to
be
traveled.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see,
if
you
take
the
government's
position
that
it
really
doesn't
matter,
it
gets
thrown
back
into
(b),
and
you
can
take
all
those
factors
into
account,
and
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
the
confession
was
reasonable.
but
if
you
take
your
position,
the
defendant
automatically
walks,
or
at
least
his
confession
is
automatically
thrown
out,
and
the
only
exception
made
is
if
the
means
of
transportation
and
the
distance
to
be
traveled
made
--
made
6
hours
impracticable.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
certainly
is
a
very
back-door
way
of
doing
it,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
you
still
have
this
disincentive
which
--
wouldn't
you
still
have
this
disincentive,
which
is
considerable?
if
you
--
if
you
exceed
the
time
limit,
it
--
it
may
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
that
the
confession
was
involuntary.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
enough
of
a
disincentive?
if
you
delay
too
long,
that
delay
is
one
of
the
factors
to
be
taken
into
account
in
deciding
whether
the
confession
was
voluntary.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
isn't
there
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
must
be
losing
the
thread
of
the
argument.
it
seems
to
me
that
mcnabb
and
mallory
only
provide
punishment
for
excessive
delay
where
there
has
been
a
confession.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
long
as
the
length
of
the
--
the
delay
can
still
be
considered
as
one
of
the
elements
in
determining
that
the
--
that
the
confession
is
involuntary,
there
is
still
a
degree
of
incentive
based
upon
only
the
confession.
now,
it
--
it
may
not
be
as
high
a
degree,
that
it
isn't
automatically
excluded,
but
the
police
are
going
to
have
to
consider
that
any
confession
they
may
get
within
that
period
of
excessive
delay
may
be
challengeable.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
knew
you
were
going
to
get
to
3501
eventually.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
i
tend
to
think
that
what
we
should
be
focusing
on
is
the
language
of
--
of
3501.
can
i
bring
you
back
to
that?
what
i
do
not
understand
about
your
argument
is
the
following:
the
6
--
the
6-hour
safe
harbor
applies
only
when
the
confession
is
made
voluntarily.
right?
i
would
think
that
the
proviso
likewise
assumes
voluntariness.
that
is,
the
time
limitation
contained
in
this
subsection
--
it's
a
time
limitation
applicable
to
voluntary
confessions.
and
it
says
that
time
limitation
shall
not
apply
in
any
case
in
which
the
delay
in
bringing
the
person
is
--
beyond
6
hours
is
found
by
the
trial
judge
to
be
--
to
be
reasonable.
i
think
you
have
already
voluntariness
assumed
in
the
proviso,
but
you
want
us
to
go
back
and
--
reconsider
voluntariness
under
(a).
i
just
don't
think
that's
--
that's
a
fair
way
to
read
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
reading
it
that
way,
too.
otherwise
voluntary
is
in
the
--
in
the
safe
harbor.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
when
you
have
a
proviso,
which
refers
to
the
time
limitation
contained
in
this
subsection,
it's
a
time
limitation
upon
voluntary
confessions.
