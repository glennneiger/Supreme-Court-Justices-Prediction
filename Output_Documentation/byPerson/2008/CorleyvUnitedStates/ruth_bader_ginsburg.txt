justice

bader

before
we
--
before
we
get
to
the
statute,
mcnabb-mallory
are
exercises
of
this
court's
supervisory
authority
over
the
lower
courts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
were
both
pre
--
miranda
decisions,
when
now
the
defendant
is
told
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
whatever
congress
put
in
1301
--
3501,
this
court
could
say,
well,
mcnabb-mallory
are
no
longer
viable
cases
in
light
of
miranda.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
need
fundamental
principles
when
you've
got
rule
--
rule
5
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure?
don't
they
say
that
an
arrestee
shall
be
taken
before
a
magistrate
without
unreasonable
delay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
least
one
time
limit
that
has
been
complied
with
--
that's
the
fourth
amendment,
how
long
you
can
keep
somebody
seized
without
taking
them
before
a
magistrate.
there's
no
violation
of
that
time
period,
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we're
talking
about
rule
5,
and
rule
5
doesn't
say
a
word
about
voluntary.
it
says
unnecessary
delay
--
shall
be
brought
before
a
magistrate
without
unnecessary
delay.
so
whatever
balancing
there
may
be
in
3501,
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
rule
5(a),
which
just
says
bring
the
arrestee
before
a
magistrate
without
unreasonable
delay,
that
that
has
no
teeth,
that
that
is
effectively
unenforceable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
rule
5
says
without
unnecessary
delay.
and
here
we
have
a
case,
if
i
remember
the
facts
right,
where
the
officer
said,
yes,
the
reason
we
didn't
bring
him
before
a
magistrate
sooner
is
we
wanted
to
get
a
confession
from
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
are
really
asking
the
court
to
overrule
mcnabb-mallory
because
you
say
congress
provided
6
hours,
no
mcnabb-mallory,
but
after
6
hours
the
test
is
voluntariness
--
only
voluntariness.
so
there's
nothing
left
under
the
government's
view
of
mcnabb-mallory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
--
that's
rule
5.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
have
said
without
the
exclusionary
rule,
rule
5(a)
has
no
teeth
at
all.
and
i
agree
with
that.
it
says
--
it's
a
straight-out
command:
no
unnecessary
delay.
and
isn't
the
reason
for
5(a)
exactly
what
happened
here?
this
was
a
case
where
the
--
where
the
police
officers
were
frank
to
admit
that
the
sole
reason
that
they
didn't
bring
corley
before
a
magistrate
promptly
was
to
extract
confessions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
exactly
what
mcnabb
and
mallory
were
trying
to
get--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
there
any
indication
of
the
rules
advisory
committee,
any
of
their
notes,
that
402
was
meant
to
overturn
mcnabb-mallory?
