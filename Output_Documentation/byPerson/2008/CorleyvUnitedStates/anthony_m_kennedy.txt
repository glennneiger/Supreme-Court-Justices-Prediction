justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
second
purpose
that
you
gave
to
say
that
there's
a
6-hour
safe
harbor
or
whatever
term
you
want
to
call
it,
and
beyond
6
hours,
the
court
is
free
to
reexamine
its
supervisory
rule
in
light
of
what
congress
has
provided
in
(a)
and
(b)
of
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
a
little
bit
odd
to
say
that
congress
has
built
a
statute
around
a
supervisory
rule,
but
taken
away
the
authority
of
this
court
to
reexamine
the
supervisory
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
were
trying
to
get
to
page
7
of
your
yellow
brief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
your
position
that
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
serves
purposes
other
than
to
ensure
the
voluntariness
of
the
statement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
what
you're
trying
to
reach
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
that's
true,
then
why
is
it
that
we
would
suppress
the
confession
if
it's
completely
voluntary?
i
mean,
what's
the
link
between
some
other
end
that's
being
served
by
mcnabb-mallory--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--something
other
than
voluntariness
and
suppressing
the
confession?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
do
we
want
to
avoid
delay
in
presentment?
what
reasons
do
we
give
--
and
i
assume
they're
reasons
to
contact
family
and
so
forth
--
other
than
voluntariness?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
those
rights
have
to
do
with
a
confession
that's
conceded,
for
our
analytic
purposes,
to
be
voluntary?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
all
you're
doing
is
--
is
trying
to
have
an
enforcement
mechanism
for
this
by
the
wholly
unrelated
remedy
of
suppressing
the
confession
if
it's
voluntary.
if
it's
not
voluntary,
of
course,
it's
related.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
say
a
confession
can
be
coercive
and
still
voluntary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
federal
law
has
long
required
that
when
a
suspect
is
arrested
on
federal
charges,
the
arresting
officer
bring
him
before
a
magistrate
judge
as
soon
as
reasonably
possible.
in
two
cases,
mcnabb
versus
united
states
and
mallory
versus
united
states,
this
court
has
held
that
if
arresting
officers
violate
this
law,
any
confession
the
suspect
may
give
during
the
unreasonable
delay
is
excluded
from
evidence
and
this
is
known
as
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule.
in
1968,
congress
considered
changing
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
as
well
as
overruling
our
decision
in
miranda
versus
arizona
and
it
passed
18
u.s.c.
section
3501.
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
3501
did
a
way
with
mcnabb-mallory
altogether
or
merely
limited
its
application.
the
issue
arose
here
because
petitioner
corley
confessed
to
a
bank
robbery
nine
and
a
half
hours
after
his
arrest
but
before
being
brought
before
a
magistrate.
the
third
circuit
held
his
confession
admissible
concluding
that
section
3501
eliminated
mcnabb-mallory
entirely,
we
disagreed.
section
3501
is
not
a
model
of
clarity.
section
3501(a)
says
that
any
voluntary
confession
is
admissible
in
evidence.
but
subsection
3501(c)
says
that
no
confession
shall
be
inadmissible
solely
because
of
delay
unless
the
delay
exceeds
six
hours.
if
subsection
(a)
meant
what
it
literally
said,
subsection
(c)
would
be
entirely
superfluous
because
(a)
would
make
any
voluntary
confession
admissible
regardless
of
whether
they
occurred
within
six
hours
of
the
arrest.
giving
(a)
its
literal
scope
would
also
eliminate
some
rules
of
evidence
as
it
would
make
any
voluntary
confession
admissible
even
if
it
were,
for
example,
hearsay
or
protected
by
attorney-client
privilege.
we
therefore
read
subsection
(a)
as
doing
nothing
more
than
attempting
to
overrule
miranda
and
(c)
is
limiting
mcnabb-mallory
to
confessions
given
over
six
hours
after
arrest.
section
3501's
legislative
history
confirms
that
this
is
what
congress
intended
and
this
reading
ensures
that
the
federal
requirement
of
presenting
an
arrestee
to
a
magistrate
promptly
retains
some
teeth.
now,
we
vacate
and
remand
so
the
third
circuit
can
apply
the
proper
interpretation
of
section
3501.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
scalia
and
thomas
joined.
