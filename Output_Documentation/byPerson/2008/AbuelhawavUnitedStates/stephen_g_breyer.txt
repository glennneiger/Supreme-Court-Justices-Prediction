justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
are
you
going
through
all
this
sort
of
parsing?
i
mean,
i'm
looking
at
the
legislative
history
as
well
as
the
statute
in
1970.
what
is
your
answer
to
the
last
point
that
they
made,
that
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
to
make
simple
possession
a
misdemeanor?
that's
why
they
changed
the
word,
which
--
"offense"
to
"felony".
that's
why
they
changed
the
word
"felony"
to
"misdemeanor".
and
i
can't
imagine
why
else
they
amended
the
statute,
and
just
because
i
was
curious,
i
looked
it
up,
and
that's
why
they
amended
it,
right?
so
--
so
i
mean,
the
legislative
history
makes
that
clear.
so
what
you've
done
is
figure
out
a
way
--
the
government's
figured
out
a
way
to
do
the
opposite
of
what
they
want,
to
take
people
who
simply
possess
and
transform
it
into
a
felony.
now,
what
justification
is
there
in
the
law
for
doing
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
to
the
first,
i
said
"subset".
i
didn't
say
you
undermined
the
entire
statute.
i
said
you
took
a
subset
of
people
who
simply
possessed,
and
that
subset
you
transformed
into
felons.
now,
your
response
i
guess
is
just
what
you
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what's
the
second?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
another
example
in
the
law,
anywhere
in
the
law,
where
--
and
there
may
be,
i'm
asking
--
which
you've
come
across,
where
we
have
an
illegal
business
and
there
is
a
customer;
and
all
the
customer
does
is
be
a
customer;
and
is
there
an
example
where
just
because
he's
a
customer
in
a
statutory
provision
that
normally
has
a
lesser
penalty
--
all
right;
imagine
those
circumstances
--
you
still
can
punish
him
as
if
he
--
as
if
he
ran
the
business?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
aware,
and
why
should
this
be
the
first?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
way
they're
a
customer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
way
they're
a
customer
is
they
use
the
telephone,
and
i
guess
one
side
thinks
that's
not
a
big
deal,
and
the
other
side
thinks
that,
anyway,
in
terms
of
what
congress
thought,
it's
a
tremendously
big
deal
because
congress
was
really
worried
about
telephones.
okay,
that's
possible.
so
can
you
get
a
parallel
that's
like
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
one
comes
to
mind?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
jurisdictional
hook.
what
i'm
looking
for
is
there's
a
business
and
a
customer,
the
statute
punishes
the
business
worse
than
the
customer.
now,
we
get
the
customer
as
if
he
were
a
business
participant.
that's
what
i'm
looking
for,
where
it's
the
way
he
does
it
--
i.e.,
whether
he
uses
a
telephone
or
whether
he
uses
a
telegram
or
semaphore
signals
or
--
where
the
--
where
the
means
of
communication
here
or
something
like
that
suddenly
transform
him?
anything
else
that
comes
to
mind?
i
didn't
expect
there
to
be,
but
i
just
thought
maybe
you'd
think
of
an
analogy,
which
would
be
helpful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
the
legislative
history?
because
i
would
read
it
--
and
in
fact
what
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
suggesting,
when
you
read
the
statute,
is
using
a
telephone
is
--
because
justice
kennedy
came
up
with
a
good
example
of
what
i
was
thinking
of.
if
the
buyer
sits
there
with
a
gun,
well,
that's
different,
he
shouldn't
have
the
gun,
and
it's
not
surprising
that
he
gets
a
higher
sentence.
and
you're
saying
by
reading
the
text
you've
discovered
congress
thinks
that
cell
phones
are
sort
of
like
guns.
okay.
i
grant
you
somebody
might
have
thought
that.
justice
souter
thinks
it's
not
intuitively
obvious,
but
is
there
any
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
that
indeed
is
what
people
in
congress
thought
when
they
passed
this
statute?
i'll
read
it
if
there
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
should
i
read?
where
--
what
exactly--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--normally,
where
that
is
involved,
i've
learned,
it's
called
what
justice
scalia
called
it
"a
jurisdictional
hook".
they
don't
think
the
underlying
behavior
is
worse,
but
they
believe
there
has
to
be
a
basis
and
should
be
a
basis
for
federal
prosecution.
i
started
out
where
he
was.
i
thought
this
is
just
a
jurisdictional
hook,
but
now
you
say
no,
it
isn't;
it's
much
worse
than
that.
it's
like
carrying
a
gun,
not
quite
as
bad
as
that,
but
on
that
--
in
that
direction.
so
i'm
asking
you
what
would
i
read
in
this
history
to
show
that
what
you're
claiming
is
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
what
--
you've
cited
that
in
the
brief
so
i
can
find
it?
