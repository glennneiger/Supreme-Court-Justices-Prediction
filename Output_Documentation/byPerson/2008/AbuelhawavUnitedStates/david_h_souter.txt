justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
we
know
from
this
case
they're
likely
to
bring
charges.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
there's
--
there's
a
difference
here,
and
that
is,
as
these
cases
illustrate,
three
phone
calls
for
one
trifling
sale,
two
for
another,
this
gives
a
kind
of
multiplier
effect
which
it's
--
it's
hard
to
find
a
parallel
for
in
the
law.
we
go
from
a
misdemeanor
to
12
years,
depending
on
the
fact
that
there
were
--
there
were
a
couple
of
cell
phone
calls.
that
is
--
maybe
--
maybe
that
is
exactly
what
congress
intended,
and
maybe
that's
good
law
enforcement
policy,
but
those
are
not
sort
of
two
intuitively
obvious
positions.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
the
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
--he
knows
the
difference,
that
--
he
knows
that
he's
committing
a
felony,
and
the
possessor
of
a
gram
or
less
doesn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
miller,
in
answer
to
one
of
justice
breyer's
earlier
questions,
he
indicated
that
the
premise
of
his
question
was
the
effect
of
the
twin
amendments
from
offense
to
felony
and
from
felony
to
misdemeanor
for
possession
of
small
quantities.
and
he
said,
well,
in
effect,
is
--
is
that
combination
of
amendments
really
being
rendered
nugatory
by
the
view
that
you
take
of
the
statute?
and
you
said
not
necessarily,
and
you
said
there
may
be
some
drug
transactions
in
which
it
is
a
misdemeanor
on
both
sides,
so
that
the
statute
wouldn't
apply
there.
are
there
any
other
--
are
there
many
examples
of
that?
i
thought
not.
and
are
there
any
other
examples
of
misdemeanor-misdemeanor
cases
that
the
--
that
the
statute
would
apply
to
so
that
--
so
that
the
anomaly
wouldn't
be
quite
so
obvious?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
how
important
is
this?
it
looks
to
us
--
i
mean,
i
think
it
was
the
premise
of
the
question
and
it
was
--
it
was
my
assumption
coming
in
that
your
view
of
the
statute
largely
renders
those
two
amendments,
or
the
combined
effect
of
those
two
amendments,
virtually
nugatory.
and
you
said,
well,
not
necessarily
because
there
may
be
misdemeanor-misdemeanor
cases.
and
i
want
to
know
how
many
of
them
there
are.
is
that
really
a
significant
area
for
the
application
or
nonapplication
of
this
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
many
separate
--
how
many
misdemeanor-misdemeanor
combined
offenses
are
there
under
the
--
under
the
code?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
--
you
don't
have
any
figures
on
the
number
of
actual
prosecutions
under
--
under
the
--
in
the
misdemeanor-misdemeanor
combination
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
--
well,
then,
i
guess
that
leads
to
my
last
question,
and
that
is:
isn't
it
probably
true
that
if
we
accept
your
view
of
the
statute,
then
the
effect
of
those
two
combined
amendments,
offense
to
--
to
felony,
felony
to
misdemeanor
for
small
quantities,
the
--
the
combined
effect
of
--
of
those
two
statutes
is,
in
effect,
rendered
worthless
in
--
in
most
cases?
in
the
substantial
number
of
cases
to
which
the
--
the
communication
facility
statute
would
be
applied.
it
--
it
would
render
those
--
those
two
amendments,
in
effect,
worthless?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
may
be
the
relevant
inquiry,
but
what
about
my
irrelevant
inquiry?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
going
to
--
your
--
your
view
of
the
statute
is
going
to
render
those
two
amendments
virtually
dead
letters.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
as
you
said
--
as
you
said,
they
--
you
don't
have
figures
on
the
number
of
prosecutions.
and
the
number
of
prosecutions
under
those
misdemeanors,
as
distinct
from
the
number
of
applications
of
the
communications
statute
to
conventional
buyer-seller
transactions,
is
probably
the
difference
between
a
very
small
set
and
a
very
large
set
of
cases.
and
in
the
very
large
set
of
cases,
the
two
amendments
are
being
rendered,
in
effect,
worthless;
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
fbi
agents
believed
that
mohammed
said
was
selling
cocaine
and
got
a
warrant
to
tap
his
cell
phone.
while
listening
in,
they
recorded
six
calls
in
which
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
salman
abuelhawa
arranged
two
purchases
of
cocaine
from
said
each
time
for
a
single
gram.
abuelhawa's
two
purchases
were
misdemeanors
under
the
drug
laws
while
said's
two
sales
were
felonies.
the
government
nonetheless
charged
abuelhawa
with
six
felonies
under
21
u.
s.
code
843(b)
which
prohibits
the
use
of
a
communications
device,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
in
causing
or
facilitating
a
drug
related
felony.
the
government's
theory
was
that
each
time
abuelhawa
used
the
phone
to
arrange
his
misdemeanor
purchases
he
had
also
been
facilitating
said's
felony
drug
sales.
abuelhawa
argued
unsuccessfully
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
term
“facilitating”
should
not
be
read
so
broadly.
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
among
the
circuits
as
to
whether
a
misdemeanor
drug
buyer
who
uses
a
phone
during
a
drug
transaction
can
be
said
to
facilitate
the
seller's
felony
under
843(b).
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
conclude
that
the
answer
is
no
and
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit.
while
the
drug
purchase
might
literally
be
described
as
facilitating
the
drug
sale,
several
reasons
convinced
us
that
congress
did
not
intend
such
an
expansive
meaning.
to
begin
with,
the
government's
use
to
facilitate
sits
uncomfortably
with
common
usage.
we
would
not
normally
say
a
buyer
facilitates
the
sale
any
more
than
we
would
say
that
a
borrower
facilitates
a
bank
loan.
moreover,
the
traditional
law
is
that
where
a
statute
treats
one
party
in
a
bilateral
transaction
more
leniently,
courts
will
not
treat
that
party's
mere
participation
as
aiding
and
abetting
the
action
of
the
other
for
fear
of
appending
the
calibration
of
relative
penalties
set
by
the
legislature.
this
line
of
reasoning
is
exemplified
in
the
court's
consistent
refusal
to
treat
noncriminal
liquor
purchases
as
aiding
and
abetting
the
illegal
sale
of
alcohol.
while
these
cases
do
not
directly
control
here,
they
are
significant
for
two
reasons.
first,
we
presume
that
when
congress
enacted
843(b),
it
was
familiar
with
the
traditional
judicial
limitation
on
applying
terms
like
“aid”
and
“abet”
so
we
think
it
likely
that
congress
had
a
comparable
scope
in
mind
when
it
used
the
comparable
term
"facilitate."
second,
as
in
the
earlier
cases,
a
broader
reading
of
facilitate
would
skew
the
congressional
calibration
of
buyer-seller
penalties.
as
the
government
sees
it,
abuelhawa's
use
of
a
phone
in
making
two
small
drug
purchases
would
subject
him
to
six
felony
counts
and
a
potential
sentence
of
24
years
in
prison
even
though
buying
the
same
drugs
minus
the
phone
would
have
supported
only
two
misdemeanor
counts
and
two
years
of
prison.
congress
used
no
language
spelling
out
a
purpose
so
improbable
but
instead
legislated
against
the
background
usage
of
terms
such
as
“aid”
and
“abet”
and
shows
to
treat
small
purchases
more
leniently
than
drug
distribution.
the
government's
position
is
just
too
unlikely.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
