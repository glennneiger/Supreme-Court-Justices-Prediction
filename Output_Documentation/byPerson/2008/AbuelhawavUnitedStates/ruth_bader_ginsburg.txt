justice

bader

can
you
be
specific
about
who
those
persons
would
be?
you
say
not
a
misdemeanant
drug
user.
so
who
would
be
caught
in
the
843(b)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i
would
like
to
--
who
does
this
target?
the
girlfriend
is
--
is
a
good
law
school
exam
type
question,
but
in
the
real
world
who
is
covered?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
statute
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
differentiate
between
buyer
and
seller
in
terms
of
who
makes
the
call.
i
gather
the
purchaser
for
his
or
her
own
use
would
be
just
as
susceptible
to
this
statute
if
the
dealer
called
and
said:
i've
got
a
gram
of
cocaine;
i
know
you're
interested
in
having
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
changed
in
1970,
wasn't
it?
wasn't
the
text
"offense"
originally,
and
then
congress
changed
it
to
"felony"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
didn't
--
i
haven't
heard
you
question
so
far
the
government's
rationale.
the
reason
congress
did
this
is
it's
more
difficult
to
detect
a
drug
deal
when
it's
by
telephone
than
if
it
were
an
encounter
on
the
street
or
in
an
apartment.
you
have
not
questioned
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
he
leaves
a
message?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
case
we
have
two
separate
episodes,
each
involving
one
gram
of
cocaine?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
were
a
total
of
seven
phone
calls?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
would
be
an
exposure--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--twenty-four
years
for
the
one
gram
of
cocaine
on
two
occasions.
do
you
agree
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
who
initiates
the
call?
that
is,
if
the
seller
says
--
seller
calls
the
buyer,
and
says,
i
understand
that
you
are
in
the
market
for
one
gram
of
cocaine,
i'll
sell
it
to
you.
is
the
buyer
similarly
subject
to
this
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
we
are
assuming
the
purchase
is
made
in
either
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
you're
saying
is
it
doesn't
matter
who
initiates
the
call?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
do
know
that
--
that
congress
drew
a
line
it
hadn't
drawn
before
between
the
own-purpose
users
and
people
who
were
in
the
trafficking
business,
and
it
expressed
sympathy
for
the
--
or
leniency,
a
policy
of
leniency.
but
the
difference
between
the
classification
felony
and
misdemeanor
is
huge
in
terms
of
consequences
for
a
person's
life.
so
let's
take
the
defendant
in
this
case.
if
he
becomes
a
felon,
rather
than
a
misdemeanant,
even
if
it's
his
first
time
and
it's
only
one
gram,
he
loses
a
lot
of
rights,
doesn't
he?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
i'm
speaking
about
the
post
consequences.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
like
--
let's
take
a
young
person.
it
has
an
effect
on
student
loans,
government
loans?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
may
be
that
in
certain
states
voting
rights
are
removed,
and
there
is
on
this
person's
record
forever
that
he
is
a
felon.
it
just
seems
odd
that
congress
would
have
at
one
and
the
same
time,
in
the
same
statute,
say,
we
want
these
--
to
give
these
people
a
chance,
and
if
they
are
in
a
rehabilitation
program
and
they
make
it,
they
won't
even
get
any
charge,
not
even
a
misdemeanor
charge,
and
then
say,
but
a
whole
group
of
them
are
going
to
be
treated
just
like
traffickers
if
they
use
a
telephone.
it's
hard
--
these
two
would
seem
to
be
working
at
odds
with
each
other.
so
mustn't
the
court
then
try
to
reach
some
accommodation,
some
harmonization
of
these
two
provisions?
and
it
was
suggested
that
we
do
that
by
saying
"facilitation"
--
"causing"
in
this
context
--
means
the
same
thing
as
"aiding
and
abetting".
then
we
have
the
buyer-seller
rule
for
the
aider
and
abettor,
and
then
we
have
made
these
two
provisions
harmonious.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
--
the
statement
that
in
the
manual
--
maybe
this
is
incorrect
--
but
that
the
charging
policy
of
the
department
of
justice
instructs
prosecutors
to
charge
the
most
serious
offense
supported
by
the
facts?
and
if
that's
true,
then
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
would
have
no
choice.
the
most
serious
offense
is
not
misdemeanor
of
simple
possession,
but
it
is
the
violation
of
843(b).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ordinarily--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
that
the
policy,
first
of
all?
that
they're
supposed
to
charge
the
most
serious
offense
supported
by
the
facts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
means
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
whether
the
dealer
picks
up
the
phone
or
the
buyer
picks
up
the
phone
for
a
transaction
for
one
gram
of
cocaine,
the
prosecutor
has
no
choice
but
to
indict
under
843(b)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
talking
about
the
choice
between
misdemeanor,
simple
possession
misdemeanor,
or
843
--
adding
on
this
843(b).
the
prosecutor
--
if
what
i
read
is
correct
--
has
no
discretion,
has
to,
if
he
makes
the
charge
--
he
cannot
make
a
simple
misdemeanor
charge.
he
has
to
charge
the
felony.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
work?
i
mean,
i
know
your
overall
rationale
about
the
ease
of
detection
--
easier
to
detect
face
to
face
encounter
on
the
streets.
but
here,
i
mean,
we
know
that
the
government
tapped
the
dealer's
phone,
and
that's
how
the
government
got
the
list
of
the
people
who
bought
from
the
dealer.
how
common
is
it
that
--
that
either
the
buyer
or
the
seller
is
the
subject
of
a
telephone
tap?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
had
--
what
had
to
be
met
in
this
case
in
order
to
put
this
tap
on
the
dealer's
phone?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
you
would
interpret
congress
--
now
we're
getting
away
from
'56,
when
simple
possession
was
a
felony,
to
'70,
when
simple
possession
becomes
a
misdemeanor.
and
you're
saying
that
congress
meant
to
relegate
the
simple
possessor
to
misdemeanor
status,
but
only
if
the
encounter
was
face
to
face.
so
you're
reading
into
the
--
what
congress
did
to
sharply
distinguish
between
traffickers
and
users,
and
say
but
that
was
only
taking
843(b)
into
account.
that
benefit
--
that
you're
not
going
to
be
a
felon;
you're
going
to
be
a
misdemeanant
--
is
only
for
face-to-face
transactions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
talking
about
this
context,
the
purchase
of
one
gram
of
cocaine
on
one
occasion,
nothing
more.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
congress's
design
was
we
treat
as
a
less
grave
offender
the
buyer
for
his
own
use,
but
only
if
he
buys
in
a
face-to-face
encounter?
that's
what
--
what
you
would
have
to
read
--
you
would
have
to
limit
the
line
congress
drew
between
traffickers,
on
the
one
hand,
and
possessors
for
their
own
use,
on
the
other,
and
say
it
applies
only
to
drugs
purchased
in
face-to-face
encounters.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
mean,
practically--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
difference
between
being
labeled
a
misdemeanant
and
being
labeled
a
felon
is
an
enormous
difference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
could
be
a
--
a
separate
crime,
the
use
of
a
machine
gun
in
facilitating
--
in
facilitating
a
crime,
any
crime.
that
could
be--
