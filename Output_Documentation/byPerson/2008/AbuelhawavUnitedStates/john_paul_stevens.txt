justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
as
just
a
matter
of
history?
is
it
perfectly
clear?
i
think
you
said
that
the
--
the
presence
of
the
use
of
the
telephone
was
not
just
a
jurisdictional
hook,
because
back
in
1970
the
federal
government
really
wasn't
in
the
criminal
law
business
the
way
it
has
become
in
the
last
30
or
40
years.
at
that
time,
there
was
a
lot
of
concern
--
the
travel
act
and
other
statutes
--
about
exactly
what
the
federal
justification
for
--
justification
for
federal
participation
existed.
and
i
--
i
always
had
the
impression
that
that
was
really
what
was
behind
the
telephone
aspect
of
this
statute.
