mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
person
who
purchases
a
small
quantity
of
drugs
for
his
own
personal
use
commits
a
misdemeanor,
not
a
felony.
the
language
of
section
843(b)
does
not
transform
that
person
into
a
felon
if
he
uses
a
phone
in
obtaining
his
drugs,
rather
than
doing
so
strictly
face
to
face.
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
text
of
the
statute
before
turning
to
the
textual
history
and
the
statutory
context.
the
language
of
section
843(b)
covers
the
use
of
the
phone
in
committing,
in
facilitating,
or
in
causing
a
drug
felony.
that
language
presupposes
someone
who
is
causing,
facilitating,
or
committing
a
drug
felony,
and
with
respect
to
such
a
person,
it
makes
them
guilty
of
an
additional
offense
in
the
nature
of
an
aggravated
offense
if
they
use
a
phone
in
their
committing,
facilitating,
or
causing
a
drug
felony.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
would
depend
on
which
prong
you're
referring
to,
justice
ginsburg.
the
--
the
committing
prong
refers
to
persons
who
are
committing
the
underlying
drug
felony.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
the
facilitating
prong
would
refer
to
persons
who
are
aiding
or
abetting
the
underlying
drug
felony.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
she
--
she
may--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
i'm
speaking
first
and
foremost
about
the
terms
of
the
statute,
justice
kennedy.
and
to
the
extent
she
fits
within
the
terms
of
the
statute,
it
would
be
because
she
doesn't
benefit
from
the
buyer-seller
rule.
the
buyer-seller
rule
establishes
that
buyers
of
drugs
aren't
aiders
and
abettors
of
the
distribution
of
drugs,
and
equivalently
they
wouldn't
be
treated
as
facilitators
of
the
distribution
of
drugs.
now--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
the
classic
case
of
somebody
under
the
facilitating
prong
would
be
the
classic
aider
and
abettor,
for
example
a
lookout.
if
there
were
a
lookout
on
the
scene
of
a
drug
transaction,
and
they
used
a
communication
facility
to
communicate
with
the
distributor
to
let
them
know
that
buyers
were
arriving,
or
that
law
enforcement
was
in
the
neighborhood
and
the
person
ought
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
the
transaction
for
the
time
being.
that
would
be
the
sort
of
person
that
comes
within
18
u.s.c.
as
an
aider
or
abettor
of
drug
distribution
and
also
would
come
within
843(b)
as
a
facilitator
of
drug
distribution.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
it
deals
with
use
of
a
communication
facility,
but
it
deals
with
use
of
a
communication
facility
only
with
respect
to
persons
that
are
committing,
facilitating,
or
causing
a
drug
felony.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
i
don't
think
it's
a
jurisdictional
hook.
the
--
there
would
already
be
federal
jurisdiction
by
virtue
of
the
underlying
felony,
and
so
what
congress
was
concerned
with
in
penalizing
the
use
of
a
phone
as
in
the
nature
of
an
aggravated
offense
is
that,
i
think,
congress
thought
that
phones
were
being
used
to
make
detection
of
drug
trafficking
more
difficult,
and
in
particular
at
the
level
of
someone
who
was
at
the
top
of
the
food
chain
in
--
in
the
architecture
of
a
drug
distribution
chain.
that
person
was
able
to
avoid
detection
because
they
never
came
into
physical
contact
with
drugs
and
they
didn't
come
into
physical
contact
with
the
persons
who
were
engaging
in
the
transaction
on
the
street.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
i
don't
--
our
argument
doesn't
depend
on
assuming
that
cell
phone
usage
was
significant
in
the
1970s.
even
in
1970,
the
statute
would
exclude
from
its
sweep
buyers
of
drugs.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
uh-huh.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
if
you
agree
with
it--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i'm
not
aware
of
a
case
that
speaks
directly
to
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
our
argument
doesn't
depend
on
that
logic,
because
even
in
1970,
certainly
land
lines
were
well
in
use,
and
in
fact
the
indications
are
that
that's
what
congress
was
principally
concerned
with
in
this
statute.
and
even
--
and
at
that
time
we
would
make
the
argument,
just
as
now,
a
person
who
used
the
telephone
in
buying
drugs
for
personal
use
wouldn't
come
within
the
ambit
of
the
provision
because
the
text
of
the
provision
goes
to
someone
who
uses
a
phone
in
committing,
in
facilitating,
or
in
causing
the
commission
of
a
drug
felony.
and
so
if
you're
not
someone
who's
facilitating
the
commission
of
a
drug
felony
in
the
first
place,
then
you
can't
be
charged
as
using
a
phone
in
facilitating
a
drug
felony.
and
the
reason
that
a
buyer
for
personal
use,
whether
we're
talking
about
1970
or
now,
wouldn't
be
considered
a
person
who
is
using
a
phone
in
facilitating
a
drug
felony
is
because
of
the
buyer-seller
rule.
buyers
aren't
aiders
and
abettors
of
the
felony
distribution,
and
by
the
same
token
they
shouldn't
be
considered
facilitators
of
felony
distribution.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
for
several
reasons,
your
honor.
first,
their
definitional
equivalence.
black's
law
dictionary
defines
"facilitating"
as
"an
act
of
aiding
or
helping
or
making
easier.
"
and
it
in
turn
defines
"aiding
and
abetting"
as
"to
facilitate
the
commission
of
the
crime.
"
so
they
mean
the
very
same
thing.
and
i
don't
think
there's
anything
talismanic
about
the
particular
formulation
"aiding
and
abetting",
and
in
fact
the
court
established
that
in
its
opinion
in
gebardi.
that
statute
dealt
with
the
mann
act,
which
barred
transporting
a
woman
for
purposes
of
engaging
in
immoral
acts
or
aiding
or
assisting
in
that
transportation
or
causing
the
transportation.
so
that
statute
uses
a
different
formulation.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
don't
know
--
the
opinion
doesn't
stand
on
the
rationale
that
the
woman
would
be
a
victim.
it
stands
on
the
rationale
that
congress,
when
it
defined
the
primary
offense,
which
is
transporting--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
use
the
word
"purchase",
with
respect,
justice
kennedy.
it
uses
the
words
"commit,
facilitate,
or
cause.
"
those
are
the
three
persons
who
come
within
section
843(b).
and
in
precisely
parallel
fashion,
under
18
u.s.c.
2,
the
general
aider
or
abettor
provision,
that
provision
applies
to
persons
who
commit
the
underlying
offense,
who
aid
or
abet
the
underlying
offense,
or
who
cause
the
underlying
offense.
and
that
precisely
parallel
structure
reinforces
that
843(b)
serves
the
same
purpose
and
means
the
same
thing
as
"aiding
or
abetting"
and
the
other
words
that
apply
in
section--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
don't
think
that's
a
distinction
that
ultimately
makes
a
difference,
justice
kennedy,
for
the
following
reason:
this
statute
does
deal
both
with
someone
who
is
involved
in
the
underlying
felony
and
use
of
the
phone
on
top
of
that,
but
it's
in
the
nature
of
an
aggravated
offense.
it
presupposes
somebody
who
is
committing,
causing,
or
facilitating
the
underlying
drug
offense,
and
then
it
makes
them
guilty
of
an
aggravated
offense
if
they
use
a
phone
in
the
course
of
doing
so.
so
the
first
question
you'd
have
to
ask
is
whether
the
person
is
committing,
facilitating,
or
causing
the
drug
felony
in
the
first
place.
and
if
i
could
use
one
hypothetical
statute
to
illustrate
that.
if
this
statute,
instead
of
saying
"facilitating",
dealt
by
terms
with
use
of
a
phone
in
aiding
or
abetting
a
drug
felony,
you
would
still
have
use
of
the
phone
in
addition
to
the
underlying
drug
felony.
but
the
first
question
i
think
one
would
ask
in
looking
at
that
provision
is
whether
the
person
who's
accused
of
violating
the
law
were
aiding
or
abetting
a
drug
felony.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't
know
that
there
are
other
provisions
that
would
create
a
similar
oddity.
i
think
this
one
is
particularly
anomalous,
the
use
of
a
statute
to
penalize
somebody
who
otherwise
would
be
a
misdemeanant,
except
that
they
use
a
phone
in
the
course
of
their
purchase
for
personal
use.
the
classic
situations
in
which
the
statute
does
apply,
which
aren't
anomalous
because
they
make
sense
given
what
congress
had
in
mind,
would
be
the
use
of
a
phone
to
facilitate
drug
distribution,
if
someone
were
a
lookout,
again,
or
if
someone
were
a
trafficker
and
they
instructed,
for
example,
retail
sellers
where
to
go
to
pick
up
stock,
a
stock
house
of
drugs.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
two
steps
to
respond
to
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
in
terms
of
whether
it
makes
it
easier,
i
think
one
could
say
the
very
same
thing
in
an
aiding
or
abetting
prosecution.
aiding
or
abetting
means
the
same
thing
as
facilitating,
and
so
you
could
make
the
argument,
i
think,
that
buying
drugs
and
engaging
in
the
sorts
of
actions
that
naturally
accompany
the
purchasing
enterprise
make
the
sale
easier,
including
directing
where
the
sale
is
going
to
occur
and
things
like
that.
but
we
know
already
that
buyers
of
drugs
aren't
considered
aiders
and
abettors
of
drugs
for
purposes
of
liability
under
18
u.s.c.
2.
and
i
think
by
the
same
token
they
shouldn't
be
considered
facilitators
of
drugs
for
purposes
of
section
843(b).
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
with
respect
--
i'm
sorry?
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't
think
so,
justice
alito.
i
probably
would
have
to
know
more
about
exactly
what
they
did,
but
if
it
is
a
--
if
what
they
did
is
a
normal
incident
of
purchasing,
then
i
think
it
would
fall
within
the
buyer-seller
rule.
otherwise,
i
think
the
government,
under
an
18
u.s.c.
2
prosecution
for
aider
and
abettor
liability,
could
make
precisely
the
same
sorts
of
arguments.
the
government
could
argue,
for
example,
that
this
person
didn't
just
buy
drugs.
they
instigated
the
purchase
because
they
made
the
first
phone
call.
they
didn't
accept
the
first
phone
call.
they
made
the
first
phone
call,
and
so
that
takes
them
outside
the
buyer-seller
rule.
but
i
don't
think
that
argument
would
work
under
18
u.s.c.
2
because
making
the
first
phone
call
is
a
normal
incident
of
purchasing.
and,
of
course,
someone
who
purchases
drugs
for
personal
use
is
going
to
want
to
take
measures
to
make
sure
that
the
purchase
goes
through.
their
ultimate
objective
is
to
get
their
hands
on
the
drugs.
and
so--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
--
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
it
would
apply
equally
in
that
situation,
and
from
our
perspective
that
points
up
even
more
of
the
anomaly
in
applying
it
to
this
factual
context.
and
that
would
equally
be
the
case
under
18
u.s.c.
2.
one
could
draw
distinctions
between
who
makes
the
initial
phone
call
and
other
sorts
of
normal
incidents
of
the
purchasing
enterprise.
but
i
don't
think,
justice
alito,
that
because
someone
engages
in
drug
--
in
--
in
a
transaction
in
a
way
that
makes
it
particularly
likely
that
the
purchase
is
going
to
be
successful,
that
that
alone
would
take
you
outside
the
buyer-seller
rule.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
buyer-seller
rule
deals
with
the
circumstance
in
which
the
way
the
person
is
--
is
associated
with
a
felony
is
they're
associated
with
the
distributor's
felony.
and
so
what
the
buyer-seller
rule
says
is
that
a
buyer
isn't
an
aider
and
abettor
of
the
seller's
distribution,
and
i
think
by
the
same
token
shouldn't
be
associated
with
the
seller's
facilitation.
but
in
your
hypothetical,
where
the
buyer
himself
is
committing
a
felony
because
his
possession
because
of
certain
characteristics
associated
with
it
make
it
a
felony,
the
buyer
himself
would
be
committing
a
felony.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right,
couldn't
be
convicted
of
facilitating
the
seller's
felony,
but
would
fall
within
the
ambit
of
section
843(b)
in
any
event
because
they
would
have
used
a
phone
in
connection
with
their
own
felony.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
about
that,
but
--
but
i
think
what
i
do
know
is
it
doesn't
create
any
greater
problems
of
application
than
already
exist
under
federal
drug
laws.
because
the
federal
drug
laws
bar
both
possession
for
personal
use
under
the
civil
possession
statute,
section
844,
and
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
under
841.
and
so
courts
and
juries
and
the
government
already
have
to
make
those
sorts
of
decisions,
and
i
don't
know
that
they've
been
particularly
difficult
to
make.
they
have
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
sorts
of
quantities
and
other
aspects
of
the
offense
that
bring
it
within
the
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
land
or
whether
the
possession
is
of
such
a
small
quantity,
and
there
aren't
other
associated
characteristics
of
the
offense
that
make
it
possession
for
purposes
of
personal
use.
that
distinction
is
one
that's
already
embedded
in
the
fabric
of
the
drug
laws,
and
we're
just
applying
the
same
distinction
for
purposes
of
this
statute.
i
don't
think
we're
making
it
any
more
complicated
than
it
already
is.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
it's
--
it's
definitely
within
the
rule
of
lenity,
and
i
think
that's
the
principal
place
that
it's
found.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
of
any
background
principle
that
one
would
bring
to
bear
on
that
other
than
the
--
the
normal
tools
of
statutory
construction
that
i've
already
talked
about
in
the
first
place,
which
is
you
look
at
the
text,
and
you
look
at
the
statutory
history,
and
you
look
at
the
statutory
context.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
think
as--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
as
a
general
rule
we
ought
to
be
circumspect
about
doing
that.
my
--
my
understanding
is
that
circumspection
is
given
voice
through
the
rule
of
lenity.
but
a
background
principle
of
particular
applicability
here
is
--
is
the
statutory
history.
it
--
it
is
the
statutory
history.
and
i'm
speaking
now
in
terms
of
the
enacted
statutory
text;
not
legislative
history,
but
the
history
of
the
enacted
statutory
text.
and
what
that
bears
on
is
not
the
word
"facilitating",
which
is
what
the
buyer-seller
rule
particularly
pertains
to,
but
the
word
"felony",
which
is
another
word
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
and
so
congress
could
have
barred
the
use
of
a
phone
in
connection
with
any
drug
offense,
including
a
drug
misdemeanor,
but
congress
pointedly
didn't
do
so.
it
barred
the
use
of
a
phone
in
connection
only
with
a
drug
felony.
and
because
it
chose
to
limit
the
offense
to
the
use
of
a
phone
in
connection
with
a
drug
felony,
the
effect
is
to
exclude
from
the
purview
of
the
statute
use
of
a
phone
in
connection
with
a
drug
misdemeanor.
now,
petitioners--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
before
the
controlled
substances
act,
the
communication
facility
provision
barred
the
use
of
a
phone
in
connection
with
any
drug
offense.
and
in
1970
in
the
controlled
substances
act,
congress
narrowed
its
reach
to
encompass
only
use
of
a
phone
in
connection
with
a
drug
felony.
so
it
excluded
use
of
a
phone
in
connection
with
a
drug
misdemeanor,
and
that's
significant
in
two
respects.
one
is,
even
without
reference
to
the
statutory
context
of
the
1970
controlled
substances
act,
it's
significant
because
congress
excluded
use
of
a
phone
in
connection
with
a
drug
misdemeanor.
petitioner
used
a
phone
in
connection
with
his
misdemeanor,
simple
possession.
but
under
the
government's
argument,
the
very
same
conduct
by
the
very
same
person
would
be
brought
back
into
the
fold
of
the
statute.
even
though
congress
excluded
it,
it
would
be
brought
back
into
the
fold
of
the
statute
by
recasting
it
as
facilitating
the
dealer's
felony.
and
the
mode
of
analysis
the
court
used
in
gebardi
and
the
mode
of
analysis
that
underlies
the
buyer-seller
rule
to
begin
with
would
--
would
lead
us
not
to
infer
that
congress
would
have
intended
that
result.
but
in
terms
of
the
history
and
the
statutory
context
which
you
were
alluding
to,
justice
ginsburg,
it
is
significant
for
that
reason,
as
well,
because
the
context
in
which
congress
narrowed
the
reach
of
section
843(b)
so
that
it
only
encompasses
facilitation
of
a
felony
and
not
facilitation
of
a
misdemeanor
is
one
in
which
congress,
in
the
1970
act,
sought
to
extend
leniency
and
afford
a
chance
at
rehabilitation
to
drug
users.
and
that's
manifested
not
in
legislative
history
but
in
the
statutory
text
itself,
because
congress
penalized
simple
possession
for
personal
use
as
a
misdemeanor;
whereas,
the
receipt
of
drugs
previously
was
a
felony,
regardless
of
the
purpose
of
the
possession,
whether
it
was
for
use
or
for
distribution.
but
congress
did
more
than
that,
because
in
immediately
adjacent
provisions
to
the
one
in
which
it
narrowed
simple
possession
to
a
misdemeanor,
it
also
enacted
a
provision
which
is
now
found
in
18
u.s.c.
3607,
which
allowed
a
simple
possessor
who
is
a
first-time
offender
to
avoid
any
conviction
at
all
if
they
successfully
complete
a
period
of
probation.
and
congress
went
further
still
because
it
also
enacted,
in
another
adjacent
provision,
further
relief
for
a
first-time
simple
possessor
who
is
under
the
age
of
21.
with
respect
to
that
person,
it
allowed
the
person
to
obtain
a
complete
expungement
of
the
criminal
records
associated
with
the
arrest.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
the
basis--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--yes.
before
1970
it
would
have
been
a
very
difficult
climb
because
--
not
only
because
the
communication
facility
applied
to
any
drug
offense,
but
because
simple
possession
wasn't
a
misdemeanor.
and--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
--
it
wasn't
sub
silentio.
it
was
explicit.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
well,
it's
in
part
because
of
the
changes
in
this
section.
this
section
changed
from
"any
offense"
to
"felony",
so
it's
the
text
of
this
section
itself.
and
the
buyer-seller
rule
equally
applied
in
--
before
1970.
it's
just
that
before
1970
you
wouldn't
have
had
to
show
that
the
buyer
was
associated
with
the
seller's
felony,
because
the
buyer
was
associated
with
his
own
offense
and
that
was
enough,
because
at
that
point
the
buyer's
offense
was
a
felony.
and
then
the
law,
section
843(b),
didn't
care
whether
it
was
a
felony
because
it
applied
to
any
drug
offense.
it's
only
after
1970
that
this
distinction
becomes
important,
because
after
1970
it's
clear
that
the
buyer
for
personal
use
doesn't
use
a
phone
in
committing
a
drug
felony.
what
he's
committing
is
a
drug
misdemeanor.
so
you
have
to
find
some
way,
if
you're
the
government,
to
make
him
associated
with
the
drug
felony.
and
way
that
arises--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right,
which
is
the
only
avenue
available
after
1970.
there
was
a
different
avenue
available
before
1970,
because
before
1970
a
purchaser
of
drugs
would
--
if
they
used
a
phone
in
connection
with
their
purchase,
would
have
used
a
phone
in
connection
with
a
drug
offense.
and
now
the
statute
is
different
in
two
respects:
one,
it
only
covers
use
of
a
phone
in
connection
with
a
drug
felony;
and,
two,
in
another
provision,
congress
narrowed
the
simple
possession
offense
from
a
mis
--
from
a
felony
to
a
misdemeanor.
and
congress
did
so
with
respect
to
the
historical
context
in
an
immediately
adjacent
provision.
it
narrowed
843(b)
in
an
immediately
adjacent
provision
to
the
one
in
which
it
provided
that
the
simple
possessor
could
avoid
any
conviction
at
all
and
the
one
in
which
it
provided
that
a
youthful
offender
could
obtain
a
complete
expungement
of
its
records.
and--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
we
don't
question
that,
your
honor,
but
i'd
like
to
make
two
points
with
respect
to
that:
first
of
all,
it
may
be
more
difficult
--
the
use
of
the
telephone
may
be
more
difficult,
and
that
may
be
the
animating
purpose
that
congress
sought
to
address
through
this
provision.
but
that
purpose
is
substantially
served
even
in
the
context
of
this
case,
because--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--use
of
a
phone
may
make
detection
more
difficult,
and
that
may
be
the
animating
purpose
--
excuse
me.
that
may
have
been
the
animating
purpose
behind
the
enactment
of
this
provision.
but
that
purpose
is
substantially
served,
even
if
you
accept
our
understanding
of
the
statute
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
the
seller
comes
squarely
within
the
terms
of
section
843(b).
so
because
the
seller
comes
within
the
terms
of
section
843(b),
the
statute
is
already
operating
against
the
seller's
use
of
a
telephone.
the
question
in
our
case
is
whether
the
buyer
also
comes
within
the
ambit
of
section
843(b).
and
because
section
843(b)
presupposes
someone
who
is
committing,
facilitating,
or
committing
a
drug
felony,
the
buyer
doesn't
come
within
the
reach
of
section
843(b)
because
he's
not
committing,
causing,
or
facilitating
a
drug
felony
in
the
first
place.
the
seller
may
be,
but
the
buyer
is
not.
the
statutory
purposes
are
still
served
by
virtue
of
penalizing
the
seller.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
only
point
i
would
make
in
closing,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions
for
us,
is
that
we
think
the
statutory
text,
the
statutory
history,
and
the
context
all
weigh
in
favor
of
our
reading.
but
even
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
on
the
matter,
principles
of
lenity
would
squarely
apply
in
foreclosing
an
interpretation
that
converts
someone
who
is
a
misdemeanant
into
someone
who
is
exposed
to
multiple
felony
counts
carrying
substantial
criminal
consequences--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens,
because
as
of
1970
there
were
already
underlying
drug
laws
that
barred
distribution,
that
barred
receipt
of
drugs,
and
that
barred
most
of
the
activities
that
are
now
prohibited
under
the
drug
laws.
and
the
telephone
law
presupposes
that
one
of
those
underlying
acts
is
already
going
on.
and
so
to
the
extent
that
there
was
jurisdiction
over
those
underlying
acts,
which
presumably
there
was
since
the
statutes
are
on
the
books,
the
telephone
act
wasn't
necessary
to
create
jurisdiction.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
think
the
--
the
use
of
the
machine
gun
wouldn't
come
within
the
buyer-seller
rule
because
what
the
buyer-seller
rule
deals
with
is
a
substantive
prohibition
on
distribution.
and
the
--
the
presumption
is
that
when
congress
prohibits
distribution,
it
knows
that
there
is
also
a
receiver
of
the
banned
substance.
and
by
virtue
of
excluding
that
receiver
from
the
distribution
prohibition,
it
wouldn't
have
wanted
to
bring
that
receiver
back
within
the
fold
of
the
statute.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that
wouldn't
apply--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
was
just
going
to
say
i
don't
think
that
would
apply
with
somebody
who
is
using
a
machine
gun
because
the
person
who
is
using
a
machine
gun
isn't
necessarily
part
of
the
distribution
offense
to
begin
with.
and
so
the
buyer-seller
principle
would
apply
with
respect
to
the
underlying
purchase
of
drugs
if
that
were
at
issue.
but
if
you
tack
on
use
of
a
machine
gun,
i
don't
think
the
buyer-seller
principle
would
speak
directly
to
that.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
oh--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--oh,
no,
i'm
sorry,
justice
alito.
if
the
hypothetical
statute
barred
use
of
a
phone
in
facilitating
a
drug
felony,
if
it
was
precisely
parallel
to
this
one,
then
we'd
make
the
same
argument.
but
it's
not
because
the
use
of
a
machine
gun
falls
within
the
buyer-seller
principle.
it's
because
the
underlying
act
of
purchasing
drugs
falls
within
the
buyer-seller
principle.
and
if
the
prohibition
is
on
use
of
a
machine
gun
in
some
underlying
act,
then
you
have
to
look
at
the
underlying
act.
and
the
underlying
act
is
governed
by
the
buyer-seller
principle,
and
buyers
fall
outside
of
it.
and
so
the
use
of
a
machine
gun
by
someone
who
is
already
outside
of
the
act
wouldn't
bring
the
buyer
back
into
the
fold
of
the
statute.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
would
be
the
same--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--if
the
--
if
the
statute
--
if
i
understand
your
hypothetical
correctly,
if
the
statute
were
use
of
a
phone
in
facilitating
a
drug
felony,
then
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--sure.
if
that
were
the
case,
then
it
would
be
different.
my
--
if
i
could
just
finish
for
a
minute,
mr.
chief
justice.
my
--
my
only
point
is
that
if
the
theory
of
prosecution
were
that
a
person
comes
within
the
fold
of
the
statute
because
they're
buying
drugs
and
that
buying
of
drugs
facilitates
the
sale
of
drugs
and,
therefore,
they
are
someone
who
uses
a
machine
gun
in
facilitating
the
sale
of
drugs,
well,
then
the
buyer-seller
rule
would
kick
in.
because
the
initial
predicate
of
that
theory,
which
is
that
the
person
is
facilitating
the
sale
by
buying,
wouldn't
work.
they
would
fall
outside
of
the
statute
at
that
stage.
