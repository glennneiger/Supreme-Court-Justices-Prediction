justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
buyer-seller
rule
would
prohibit
the
prosecution
of
a
buyer
on
the
theory
that
the
buyer
aided
and
abetted
--
aided
and
abetted
the
seller.
but
i
don't
see
why
it
applies
here.
this
is
not
a
situation
like
that.
this
is
a
different
crime,
using
a
communication
facility
in
facilitating
the
commission
of
a
felony.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
if
the
--
the
defendant
--
what
if
the
defendant
who
is
a
buyer
of
--
of
a
quantity
for
personal
use
does
more
than
simply
purchase
the
drugs?
what
if
information
is
communicated
in
the
telephone
conversation
that
makes
it
easier
for
the
transaction
to
take
place
or
less
likely
--
less
likely
that
there
is
--
that
the
person
is
going
to
be
apprehended?
would
that
person
fall
within
the
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
happen
in
the
situation
where
the
person
who
buys
the
drug
is
guilty
of
--
of
a
felony?
it's
an
instance
of
felony
possession.
wouldn't
the
application
of
your
understanding
of
the
buyer-seller
rule
in
that
situation
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
even
that
person
could
not
be
convicted
under
this
statute
for
facilitating
the
commission
of
the
felony
of
sale?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
may
--
that
may
be
true,
but
the
buyer
there
still
could
not,
under
your
theory,
be
convicted
of
facilitating
the
seller's
felony
of
selling
the
drugs.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
this
question?
i
--
i
understand
your
argument
regarding
statutory
history
and
the
harsh
consequences
of
this.
but
as
far
as
the
buyer-seller
rule
--
gebardi
and
rewis
are
concerned,
what
if
the
statute
said
--
made
it
a
crime
for
--
for
a
person
to
use
a
machine
gun
in
facilitating
the
commission
of
a
felony?
would
you
say
--
you
would
have
to
say
that
the
buyer-seller
rule
and
those
authorities
would
mean
that
that
person
could
not
be
prosecuted
if
they
were
using
the
machine
gun
to
facilitate
a
--
a
purchase
for
personal
use;
would
you
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right,
but--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
use
of
a
phone
to
facilitate
--
use
of
a
phone
in
facilitating,
use
of
--
of
a
firearm
in
facilitating--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--unless
you
can
say
that
the
--
the
use
of
a
communication
facility
in
effecting
the
purchase
is
such
a
--
a
virtually
indispensable
element
of
the
purchase
that
it
--
it
--
it's
swept
up
within
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
answer
is
that
this
--
it
would
be
the
same.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
buyer-seller
rule
would
apply
in
your
view
exactly
the
same
way.
