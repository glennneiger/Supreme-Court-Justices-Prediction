chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
08-192,
abuelhawa
v.
united
states.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
keep
talking
about
phones,
and
you
began
by
saying
this
covers
phones,
but
this
was
--
language
was
added
in
1970?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
weren't
cell
phones
of
the
kind
you
have
now.
i
think
this
was
directed
at
the
beepers,
right,
when
those
were
around
then,
or
--
or
land-based
phones
or
something
like
that.
and
the
technology
has
so
expanded
that
the
reach
of
the
statute
has
so
expanded
in
a
way
that
brings
in
a
lot
more
casual
users
than
was
the
case
before.
and
i
just
don't
know
how
that
issue
of
statutory
interpretation
is
supposed
to
be
resolved.
assuming
i'm
right
that
the
technology
has
dramatically
expanded
the
reach
of
the
statute,
even
if
you
think
it's
covered
by
its
terms,
how
is
that
issue
addressed?
what's
the
right
answer
there?
is
it
because
the
terms
still
cover
it,
that's
--
the
breadth
has
expanded,
or
because
this
is
something
new
technologically
that
the
statute
shouldn't
be
construed
that
broadly?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
let's
assume
i
don't
agree
--
let's
assume
i
agree
with
that
only
in
the
context
of
the
1970s
technology.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
the
answer
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
reminds
me
of
these
old
hypotheticals.
you
know,
before
there
were
automobiles,
you
had
to
have
someone
with
a
lantern
walk
in
front
of
your
carriage,
and
they
don't
change
the
law
and
it
still
turns
out
to
be
the
law
when
you're
driving
your
car,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
but,
i
mean,
is
there
a
case
of
ours
that
says
what
to
do
in
that
case,
in
such
a
situation
of
statutory
construction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
mean,
it's
natural
to
view
the
woman
in
that
situation
more
as
a
victim
than
as
someone
facilitating
the
crime.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
would
extend
to
your
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
really
isn't
the
transformation
of
a
misdemeanor
into
a
felony.
it's
a
separate
--
separate
activity
and
an
activity
that
facilitates
the
commission
of
a
crime.
it's
much
easier
to
carry
out
your
drug
distribution
business
if
people
are
calling
you
on
their
cell
phones
than
if
they
have
to
meet
you
in
person
or
call
from
a
land
line.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
gloss
on
this
statute
makes
--
gives
rise
to
some
difficult
questions
of
proof.
i
mean,
what
if
it's
--
i
don't
know
--
10
pounds
of
something,
and
the
guy
says,
well,
i
was
just
buying
in
bulk
for
personal
use,
like
a
costco
drug
dealer.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
would
have
lost
this
case
before
1970--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
the
incongruity
on
which
you
rely--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--didn't
exist
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
so
the
scope
of
this
language
was
changed
sub
silentio?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
this
language:
1970,
but
not
after
1970,
because
of
the
changes
in
some
other
sections?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
no.
that
question
goes
to
whether
or
not
the
distribution
was
a
felony.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
two
people
across
the
park
--
and
they
know
there's
a
drug
dealer
on
the
other
side,
the
one
waves
and
the
dealer
comes
over,
the
other
calls
on
the
cell
phone
and
the
dealer
comes
over;
the
other
gets
four
more
years?
the
phone
user
gets
four
more
years?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
suppose
he
calls
three
times.
he's
exposed
to
12
more
years,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
four
minutes,
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
08-192,
abuelhawa
versus
united
states.
