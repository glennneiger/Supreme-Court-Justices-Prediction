justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
you
had
the
girlfriend
phone
and
say:
my
boyfriend
needs
drugs;
meet
him
at
the
corner
of
3rd
and
main.
what
crime
does
the
girlfriend
commit?
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
pretty
clear
that
she's
under
843(b)
facilitating.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
she
may
then
have
committed
a
felony,
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
her
culpability
is
certainly
no
--
no
greater,
if
you're
talking
about
your
--
the
policy
of
your
statute,
than
the
--
than
the
man
that
uses
the
drugs.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
maybe
justice
ginsburg
would
like
some
further
illustration,
but
i
thought
that
that
was
one
illustration
in
answer
to
her
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
was
the
same
word.
that
was
"transporting"
in
both
instances.
here
you
have
"purchase",
one,
"facilitating"
with
a
telephone,
two.
that's
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'll
think
about
it,
but
i
think
your
--
gebardi
does
involve
one
statute,
one
act,
transportation.
this
involves
two.
the
underlying
felony
is
the
purchase
or
possession,
and
the
second
statute
is
use
of
the
telephone.
so
i
don't
--
i'll
think
about
it,
but
i
don't
think
gebardi
works.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
government
were
to
prevail
here,
i
assume
that
it
would
then
as
a
result
have
a
much
larger,
more
expansive
discretion
in
charging
and
plea
bargaining
and
--
and
et
cetera.
other
than
the
rule
of
lenity,
is
there
anything
in
our
cases
that
indicates
that
we
should
be
cautious
about
giving
the
government
that
authority
so
that
that's
an
aid
in
our
interpretation,
or
is
that
just
all
within
the
rule
of
lenity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
other
than--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no
background
principles
either
way
on
granting
the
prosecutors
vast
discretion
in
charging--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--as
it
applies
to
statutory
interpretation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
does
the
call
--
does
the
call
have
to
be
completed
--
i
mean,
if
he
gets
an
answer
saying,
"your
call
is
important
to
us,
but
we're
serving
someone
else?
"
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
carry
--
carrying
a
weapon.
a
lot
of
statutes
punish
more
severely
for
carrying
weapons.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
--
can
you
tell
me,
how
does
it
work?
the
district
--
the
united
states
attorney
in
one
state,
one
district,
has
a
case
like
this
where
there
are
four
different
phone
calls;
and
he
doesn't
like
the
looks
of
the
defendant,
or
for
some
reason
he
can
charge
him,
and
in
the
neighboring
jurisdiction
the
united
states
attorney
does
not.
are
there
guidelines?
does
the
department
of
justice
control
this
in
each
case?
is
there
some
manual
where
we
could
see
what
the
rules
are
for
charging?
is
it
all
at
the
discretion
of
the
united
states
attorney?
