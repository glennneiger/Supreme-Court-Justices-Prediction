mr.
eric
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
843(b)
prohibits
the
use
of
a
communication
facility
in
causing
or
facilitating
the
commission
of
any
act
constituting
a
felony
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
the
statute
is
violated
when
a
person
uses
a
communication
facility
such
as
a
telephone
to
purchase
controlled
substances
unlawfully.
a
call
to
order
drugs
both
causes
and
facilitates
a
felony
distribution
of
drugs.
there's
no
basis
in
the
statute
for
creating
an
exemption
for
people
who
facilitate
or
cause
felony
distributions
by
purchasing
drugs
for
their
own
personal
use.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the
phone
--
phone
user
is
exposed
to
four
more
years.
there's
no
mandatory
minimum--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
right.
congress
--
i
mean,
those
two
cases
are
different
and
congress
made
the
judgment.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
right.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
if
the
call
--
the
statute
requires
that
the
communication
facility
be
used.
and
if
the
call
doesn't
actually
go
through,
it
would
be
difficult
to
see
how
you
would
use
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--if
he
leaves
the
message
and
the
message
in
some
way
causes
or
facilitates
a
felony
drug
distribution,
then,
yes,
he
has
used
the
communication
facility.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
there
were
six.
the
government
dismissed
one
of
the
counts.
it
was
six
counts
that
went
to
trial,
six
phone
calls.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
of
24
years.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
just
getting
that
call
by
itself
wouldn't
subject
someone
to
the
statute.
but
if
you
get
the
call
and
then
engage
in
a
conversation--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--with
the
dealer
where
you
are
using
the
telephone
to
cause--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
right.
it--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
there
are
a
couple
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
first,
rewis,
as
you
say,
was
construing
the
travel
act.
it
didn't
focus
on
the
word
"facilitate",
and
it
certainly
didn't
set
out
a
general--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
right,
and
--
and
as
--
as
indicated
by
the
passage
you've
just
quoted,
the
focus
of
the
court
there
was
on
the
traveler's
purpose.
the
travel
act
requires
intent.
section
843(b)
is
different
in
that
it's
satisfied
by
knowingly
or
intentionally
using
a
phone.
so
the
court
in
rewis
said,
quite
reasonably,
that
someone
whose
only
purpose
is
to
be
a
customer
of
an
unlawful
enterprise
doesn't
have
the
intent
to
facilitate
--
and
significantly,
although
the
court's
quotation
of
the
statute
ends
at
"facilitate",
it's
not
just
to
facilitate
any
unlawful
activity;
it's
to
facilitate
the
promotion,
management--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--it
does
require.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
--
it
doesn't
have
to
be
that
you
have
the
purpose
of
facilitating
the
seller.
it's
sufficient
that
you
know
that
the
seller's--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--it
--
it
said
"intent".
it
does
not
include
the
word
"knowledge",
and
the
court
in
the
passage
you
just
read
construed
that
to
require--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--an
inquiry
into
the
traveler's
purpose.
and
it's
also
significant
that--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
one
other
difference,
then,
your
honor,
is
that
the
facilitation
that
has
to
take
place
under
the
travel
act
is
facilitation
of
the
promotion,
management,
establishment,
or
carrying
on
of
unlawful
activity,
which
is
defined
not
as
a
discrete
crime
but
as
a
business
enterprise
involving
gambling.
so
you
have
a
statute
that's
focused
on
sort
of
management
or
direction
of
an
ongoing
enterprise;
whereas,
here
under
843(b),
it's
sufficient
to
facilitate
a
discrete
act.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
answers
to
that:
first
is
that
section
843(b)
doesn't
apply
to
people
who
simply
possess.
it
applies
to
people
who
possess
by
using
a
phone
to
facilitate
a
felony
distribution.
and
congress
--
i
mean,
the
very
existence
of
the
statute
demonstrates
that
congress
thought
that
the
use
of
a
phone
is
a
separate
element
that
introduces
a
distinct
evil
that
congress
wanted
to
combat.
and
as
to
the
change
in
the
felony
language--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
yes--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--and
also
that
the
reason
for
the
--
as
you
know,
the
predecessor
to
843(b),
which
was
section
1403,
referred
to
causing
or
facilitating
any
offense.
all
of
the
enumerated
offenses
were
felonies.
in
1970,
they
changed
the
word
"offense"
to
the
word
"felony".
but
that
--
part
of
the
reason
for
that
--
there
is
no
legislative
history
specifically
addressing
the
reason
for
that
change.
but
part
of
the
reason
we
can
infer
is
that
the
1970
statute
created
a
whole
host
of
misdemeanors,
of
misdemeanor
regulatory
offenses
under
the
controlled
substances
act.
so
one
good
example
is
section
829,
which
prohibits
distributing
a
controlled
substance
without
a
prescription,
and
that's
an
offense
--
that's
a
misdemeanor,
and
that
could
easily
be
caused
or
facilitated
over
the
phone,
if
somebody
calls
a
pharmacist.
and
so
that
--
where
both
parties
to
the
transaction
are
only
engaging
in
a
misdemeanor,
that's
something
that
843(b)
would
not
apply
to.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
yes.
yes,
that's
right.
but
i
--
and
i
think
--
but
one
other
change
that
congress
made
to
843(b)
in
1970
that's
significant
is
that
it
eliminated
the
mandatory
minimum.
there
was
under
the
predecessor--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
yes.
it--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
the
buyer-seller
principle
and
the
limitation
on
aiding
and
abetting
and
accessory
liability,
as
this
court
recognized
in
gebardi,
doesn't
apply
here,
because
the
principle
that
the
court
set
out
in
that
case,
and
it
has
been
recognized
in
subsequent
cases,
is
that
--
is
that
when
congress
criminalizes
or
punishes
one
party
to
a
transaction,
that
inevitably
involves
a
second
party.
the
second
party
who
is
left
unpunished
by
the
statute
doesn't
get
swept
back
in
under
section
2
as
an
aider
and
abettor.
that
principle
doesn't
apply
here
because,
although
the
existence
of
a
purchaser
or
a
receiver
of
drugs
is
an
inevitable
incident
of
a
distribution,
the
existence
of
a
purchaser
who
uses
a
phone
is
not.
the
whole
point
of
this
statute
is
that
the
use
of
a
phone
is
a
separate
and
distinct
element
that
introduces
a
different
evil
and
that
congress
wanted
to
combat
that.
the
other
--
the
other
reason
that
aiding
and
abetting--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the
--
the
statute
--
but
by
its
terms
makes
clear
that
the
person
using
the
phone
and
the
person
committing
the
felony
don't
have
to
be
the
same
person,
and
i
think
i
understood
petitioner
to
--
to
acknowledge
that.
the
statute
doesn't
say
"knowingly
or
intentionally
use
a
communication
facility
in
causing
or
facilitating
his
or
her
commission
of
a
felony.
"
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--but
this
--
this
isn't
one,
because
this
isn't
a
case
that
punishes
people
just
for
being
a
customer.
it's
a
case
--
it's
a
statute
that
punishes
people
for
being
a
customer--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--and
using
a
phone--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--there
are
--
there's
a
whole
host
of
statutes
that
punish--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
mean,
the
wire
fraud
statute
punishes
conduct
that
might
not
be
a
federal
offense
at
all,
but
for
the
fact
that
somebody
used--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
i
mean,
if
--
as
we
identified
on
page
25
of
our
brief,
a
number
of
statutes
where
the
use
of
a
communication
facility
is
an
element
of
the
offense,
and
the
conduct
that
was
covered
by
those
statutes
in
many
cases
might
not
be
a
federal
offense
at
all.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
right.
and
i
think,
to
be
clear,
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
a
statute
that
punishes
people,
punishes
customers
as
if
they
were
distributors
or
that
aggravates
an
underlying
felony.
this
is
a
separate
offense;
it
has
its
own
penalty;
it
put
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
mean
--
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
in
the
u.s.
attorney's
manual
that
specifically
addresses
this
statute,
but
of
course
the
court
recognized
in
batchelder
that
prosecutors
legitimately
have
discretion
when
there
are
different
criminal
statutes
that
cover
the
conduct,
and--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
if
they
bring
charges
at
all,
and
of
course
that
policy
doesn't
require
prosecutors
to
--
to
bring
charges.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
mean--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes,
and
--
and
a--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
again,
if
--
if
there
is
to
be
an
indictment
at
all.
there's
no
requirement
that--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
my
understanding
of
the
policy,
but,
you
know,
this
court
has
recognized
that,
you
know,
that
sort
of
charging
decision
is
a
legitimate
aspect
of
the
system
as
long
as
it's
not
exercised
for
unconstitutional
reasons.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
the
--
the
text
of
the
statute
and
the
fact
that
it
covers
any
act
constituting
a
felony
does
demonstrate
that
that's
what
congress
intended
as
well--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the
--
the
statutory
maximum
is
four,
but
again--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--right,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the
possessor
who
purchases
the
drugs
using
his
phone
knows
that
he
is
causing
the
felony.
the
reason
he
calls
the
drug
dealer
is
because
he
wants
to
cause
the
dealer
to
send
him
drugs.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
yes,
and
it--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
mean,
beyond
--
first
of
all,
the
--
the
congress
has
a
traditional
interest
in
keeping
the
channels
of
commerce
and
communication
free
from--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the
legislative
history
of
the
1956
act,
which
is
the
--
where
the
predecessor
statute,
1403,
was
enacted,
shows
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
ability
of
drug
traffickers
and
people
engaging
in
drug
transactions
to
avoid
detection
by
using
the
phone--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
and
the
initial
proposal
in
the
initial
senate
bill
would
have
allowed
wiretapping
in
connection
with
drug
investigations
of
certain
enumerated
offenses
that
covered
both
purchasers
and
sellers.
that
was
replaced
with
the
provision
that
became
1403,
which
also
--
which
applied
"causing
or
facilitating"
enumerated
offenses,
and
again
applied
to
both
buyers
and
sellers.
and
that
statute
was
applied
to
buyers
in
a
number
of
reported
decisions
before
1970,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
1970
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
change
that
aspect.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
the
statistics
on
that,
but
certainly
a
wiretap
is
only
possible
when
demanding
standards
under
title
iii
are
met,
and
--
whereas,
a
face-to-face
meeting
can
be
observed
by
anybody
who
happens
to
be
there.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
among
other
things,
i
believe
the
statute
requires
some
showing
that
it's
not
possible
to
obtain
evidence
in
some
other
less
intrusive
way.
so
in
this
case
there
was
a
wiretap
on
the
dealer's
phone,
but
in
a
lot
of
cases
there's
not
going
to
be
that.
and
certainly
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
statute,
viewed
keeping
people
from
using
the
phones
to
conceal
their
drug
transactions
as
one
way
of
minimizing
the
need
for
more
intrusive
measures
like
wiretapping.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
it's
--
i
mean,
it
doesn't
apply
when
--
when
a
communication
facility
is
used.
it
also
doesn't
apply,
i
mean,
in
a
number
of
other
contexts,
you
know,
that
petitioner
acknowledges
that--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--as
a
first
offense.
i
mean,
that--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes,
although
i
wouldn't
describe
it
as
an
issue
of
a
less
grave
offense
or
a
more
grave
offense
in
the
sense
that
the
use
of
the
phone
aggravates
the
offense
of
possession.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
but
use
of
a
phone
is
a
different--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that
--
that's
right.
but
congress,
again,
did
recognize
that
there
could
be
a
range
of
levels
of
culpability
associated
with
the
843(b)
offense,
which
is
part
of
the
reason
that
it
eliminated
the
mandatory
minimum
when
it
amended
the
statute
in
1970,
suggesting
that
there
could
be
different
kinds
of
conduct
that
would
satisfy
it.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
mean,
if
you're
asking
other
misdemeanor
offenses
under
the
controlled
substances
act--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
mean,
there's
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
--
i
don't
know
how
many
prosecutions
are
brought
under
those
statutes.
i
imagine
that,
in
part
because
they
are
misdemeanors,
not
a
lot
of
prosecutions.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
842
--
section
842
enumerates
i
think
it
is
on
the
order
of
a
dozen
or
so,
and
then
we
cite
a
couple
of
them
in
our
brief.
so
distributing
a
--
a
controlled
--
a
prescription
drug
without
a
prescription
would
probably
be
one
of
the
most
common
that
someone
would
engage
in,
and--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no.
i
mean,
again,
because
--
because
they're
misdemeanors
and
prosecutorial
resources
are
probably
concentrated
on
the
more
serious
felony
violations
of
the
controlled
substances
act,
i
suspect
there
aren't
a
lot
of
prosecutions.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
think
the
--
the
relevant
inquiry
is:
what
--
what
did
congress
intend
in
1970
when
it
changed
the
statute?
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
i
----
[laughter]
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
mean
i
think
--
i
think
from
the
perspective
of
--
of
congress,
that
there
was
no
--
they
wouldn't
have
anticipated
that
the
amendment
would
not
have
any
consequence.
i
mean,
the
fact
that
--
that
they
created
this
whole
set
of
misdemeanors,
the
fact
that
they
aren't
violated
very
often--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--if
i
--
if
i
may
answer,
my
understanding
is
that
the
number
of
prosecutions
under
843(b)
is
--
is
also
relatively
small,
but
i
don't
have
precise
figures
on
--
on
the
comparative
numbers.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
thank
you.
