what
is
--
what
i
was
going
to
--
what
is
the
purpose
of
saying
"who
uses
a
communications
facility"?
is
that
purely
a
jurisdictional
hook?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
argument
sort
of
assumes
--
more
than
sort
of
assumes;
it
assumes
--
that
facilitating
is
the
same
as
aiding
and
abetting.
if
they
meant
aiding
and
abetting,
it's
a
--
it's
a
classic
criminal
law
term,
they
could
have
said
"aiding
and
abetting".
they
didn't.
they
used
a
different
term,
"facilitating".
why
--
why
should
i
think
"facilitating"
means
"aiding
and
abetting"?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
other
--
this
statute
does
not
just
apply
to
facilitating
a
drug
offense.
it
applies
to
any
of
the
felonies
covered
by
subchapter
2
of
the
relevant
chapter.
i
agree,
it
seems
a
little
strange
to
have
what
is
a
misdemeanor
by
a
buyer
converted
into
a
--
into
a
felony
just
by
use
of
the
phone.
what
other
situations
under
other
felony
provisions
would
arise
that
create
a
similar
oddity?
do
you
have
any
in
mind?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
the
use
of
a
phone
may
be
more
difficult?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
just
that,
he
gets
a
felony
on
his
record.
before
that
he
would
have
had
just
a
misdemeanor;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
what
do
you
do
--
the
case
that
i
find
pretty
close
to
what
we
have
here
is
rewis
v.
united
states,
which
involved
a
statute
that
prohibited
interstate
travel
with
the
intent
to,
quote,
"promote,
manage,
establish,
carry
on,
or
facilitate.
"
certain
kinds
of
illegal
activities,
one
of
which
would
have
been
gambling.
and
we
said
the
ordinary
meaning
of
this
language
suggests
that
the
traveler's
purpose
must
involve
more
than
the
desire
to
patronize
the
illegal
activity.
so
it
wouldn't
have
been
facilitating
a
gambling
operation
simply
to
be
engaging
in
interstate
travel
for
the
purpose
of
playing
the
tables.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
certainly,
it
focused
on
the
word
"facilitate".
that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
that
passage.
it
said
--
it
quoted
"promote,
manage,
establish,
carry
on,
or
facilitate.
"
and
the
ordinary
meaning
of
this
language
suggests
that
the
traveler's
purpose
must
involve
more
than
the
desire
to
patronize
the
illegal
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
that
the
"knowingly"
in
this
statute
also
requires
that
you
are
knowingly
facilitating?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
this
is
the
same
thing
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
didn't
mention
--
this
statute
didn't
mention
purpose,
either,
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
an
intent--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
find
it
pretty
close,
i
really
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
the
use
of
a
phone
in
this
statute
is
applied
to
the
seller
as
well
as
to
the
buyer.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
parallel:
use
of
a
phone
to
commit
the
offense
by
the
seller,
and
you
want
us
to
similarly
sweep
in
the
facilitating
of
the
offense
by
the
use
of
the
phone
by
the
buyer.
it
seems
to
me
pretty
parallel
to
what
we've
done
in
the
buyer-seller
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
feel
sorry
for
this
--
for
the
felon
who
is
selling
this
stuff,
too.
i
mean,
the
same
thing
is
true
of
him,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
every
time
he
makes
another
phone
call
he
gets
socked
with
another
how
many
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
so
four
times
four
times
four
every
time
he
makes
a
phone
call.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
should
feel
sorry
for
him,
too.
