well,
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
in
--
in
2008
congress
said
that
that
was
never
its
intention,
it
was
never
its
intention
for
the
president
to
have
the
authority
to
--
to
do
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
isn't
this
closely
associated
with
appropriations
and
with
foreign
aid?
the
issue
is
billions
of
dollars
were
going
to
be
needed
to
reconstruct
iraq
in
--
in
the
wake
of
the
war
and
the
money
could
be
provided
directly
by
the
united
states
through
foreign
assistance,
which
is
part
of
the
thrust
of
--
of
this
provision,
certainly.
and
the
argument
is
that
this
is
closely
related
to
it,
because
it
freed
up
other
money
that
would
be
used
for
reconstruction.
so
why
is
there
anything
odd
about
this
being
in
an
appropriations
provision?
