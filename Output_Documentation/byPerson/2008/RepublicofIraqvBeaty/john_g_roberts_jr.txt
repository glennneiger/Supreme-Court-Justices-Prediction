chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
07-1090,
republic
of
iraq
v.
beaty,
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
franklin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
take
it
your
argument
would
be
no
different
if
this
involved
some
other
area.
it
doesn't
depend
upon
the
deference
under
the
foreign
affairs--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
is
before
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hallward-driemeier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
don't
doubt,
in
absence
of
the
waiver,
that
this
is
a
claim
that
could
proceed
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunity
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
claim
could--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--putting
aside
the
waiver,
that
claim
could
proceed
despite
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
governing
authority
in
iraq?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
may
have
not
been
a
new
one,
but
there
certainly
was
not
the
old
one
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
--
that's
just
a
belt-and-suspenders
act.
i
mean,
he
--
he
has
the
authority
here,
and
he
--
although
it
may
look
difficult,
he
has
to
envision
there
may
be
people
who
challenge
that
--
his
interpretation
of
the
law.
so
there's
the
other
provision
that
will
make
it
inapplicable
under
that
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i
could
just
pause--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--for
a
moment.
the
--
the
president
in
exercising
this
waiver
purported
to
act
not
only
under
the
statute
but
under
the
constitution
as
well.
so
if
we
were
to
accept
your
argument,
we
would
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
had
the
power
under
the
constitution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
not
presented
because
your
friends
on
the
other
side
think
the
--
on
a
narrower
ground,
that
the
statute
applies.
but
if
we
agree
with
you
and
disagree
with
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
he
has
an
argument
--
the
president
has
the
argument
that
he
has
this
authority
under
the
constitution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
franklin,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
in
case
07-1090,
republic
of
iraq
versus
beaty
and
the
consolidated
case.
