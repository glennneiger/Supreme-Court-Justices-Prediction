but
there's
nothing
better
settled
--
well,
perhaps
that's
broad.
it
is
very
well
settled
that
the
president
is
the
one
to
determine
who
is
the
lawful
and
legitimate
government
that
he
would
deal
with.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
all
that
was
happening
here.
and
it's
not
just
a
question
of
one
against
the
other.
it's
a
question
of
what
government
has
survived.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
under
--
and
under
the
law
something
that
has
always
been
committed
to
the
very
large
discretion
of
the
president.
