mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
acting
with
express
statutory
authority
and
in
furtherance
of
important
foreign
policies
following
the
fall
of
the
saddam
hussein
regime,
the
president
made
inapplicable
with
respect
to
iraq
all
provisions
of
law
that
had
applied
to
countries
that
sponsored
terrorism.
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
those
provisions
included
former
section
1605(a)(7),
which
was
a
provision
of
law
that
applied
only
to
such
countries.
because
section
1605(a)(7)
was
madel
inapplicable
as
to
iraq
effective
on
the
president's
determination,
it
cannot
now
serve
as
the
applicable
statutory
basis
for
abrogation
of
iraq's
foreign
sovereign
immunity
and
therefore
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
no,
your
honor.
the
language
of
the
sunset
provision
to
which
you
are
referring
states
only
that
the
authorities
contained
in
the
section
would
expire.
that
means
the
authorities
to
the
president
given
to
him
to
act.
congress
did
not
say
that
the
effect
of
what
the
president
had
done
would
be
nullified
once
his
authority
to
act
had
expired.
and
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
president
not
only
made
inapplicable
provisions
of
law
addressed
to
state
nations
that
had
sponsored
terrorism,
but
he
also
suspended
the
iraq
sanctions
act
under
the
same
authority.
the
iraq
sanctions
act
has
never
been
repealed.
so,
if
it
were
correct
that
the
--
that
the
--
everything
that
the
president
had
done
became
nullified
upon
the
expiration
of
his
authority
to
act,
then
the
iraq
sanctions
act
would
not
only
currently
be
in
effect
today,
but
would
have
been
in
effect
since
september
30th,
2005.
and
if
there's
--
that
is
not
what
congress
intended.
the
iraq
sanctions
act
has
a
huge
panoply
of
sanctions,
both
dependent
on
and
independent
of
the
legislative
determination
of
iraq
as
a
state
sponsor
of
terrorism.
but
if
there's
any
question
about
this,
when
congress
acted
again,
the
same
congress
acted
in
2003
to
extend
the
expiration
date,
congress
--
the
--
when
that
congress
acted,
the
legislative
history
said
quite
expressly
that
the
extension
was
not
necessary
to
extend
what
the
president
had
already
done,
because
that
had
already
happened
and
that
was
permanent.
but
it
was
necessary
according
to
congress
for
other
reasons.
so
both
because
of
the
plain
language
of
the
sunset
provision
and
because
of
what
congress
subsequently
did
in
2003
to
extend
it,
as
well
as
the
interpretation
of
the
united
states
on
this
point,
the
president's
actions
didn't
sunset.
it
was
emergency
legislation
to
be
sure,
but
the
emergency
was
to
give
the
president
the
authorities.
we
were
at
war
at
that
time
and
our
foreign
policy
was
changing
180
degrees
almost
overnight
away
from
penalizing
the
government
of
saddam
hussein
as
a
state
sponsor
of
terrorism,
as
an
outlaw
regime,
and
immediately
towards
helping
the
people
of
iraq.
and
congress
gave
the
president
the
broad
catch-all
authority
to,
if
he
deemed
it
appropriate,
to
relieve
the
people
of
iraq
from
all,
not
just
some,
of
the
very
onerous
restrictions
and
disabilities
that
had
applied
to
them
as
a
result
of
the
prior
regime's
support
for
terrorism.
the
president
did
this
in
exercise
of
his
foreign
policy
judgment
in
order
that
the
people
of
iraq
could
better
rebuild
their
country
and
establish
a
new
democratic
government
that
would
in
fact
prove
to
become
one
of
the
united
states'
most
trusted
allies
in
a
region
that
has
not
always
had
very
many
of
them.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
two
things,
justice
alito:
the
--
the
first
point
is
that
this
was
not
the
congress
that
acted
in
2003.
this
was
a
subsequent
congress.
and
that
statement
occurred
almost
5
years
after
the
legislation
had
been
enacted
and
almost
3
years
after
the
president's
authority
to
act
had
expired.
as
such,
that
statement
is
nothing
more
than
subsequent
legislative
history
that
cannot
be
determinative
in
deciding
whether
the
president
acted
validly
in
2003.
that
determination
should
be
judged
according
to
the
statute
that
was
in
front
of
the
president
when
he
acted.
but
if
there's
any
question
at
all
in
the
court's
mind
about
the
application
of
that
provision,
the
president
waived
it.
he
waived
its
application
as
to
iraq.
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
president
would
not
sign
the
version
of
the
ndaa
that
just
had
that
provision
in
it.
he
vetoed
the
bill.
he
vetoed
it
only
because
of
its
effect
that
it
might
have
on
iraq,
and
he
would
not
sign
a
replacement
until
he
was
given
the
authority
to
waive
any
and
all
of
the
provisions
of
section
1083
to
the
extent
they
may
affect
iraq.
so
if
that--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
we
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
because
we
think
that
the
scope
of
the
waiver
would
have
been
to
make
inapplicable
or
to
waive
application
of
extant
provisions
of
law
to
the
extent
they
might
affect
iraq.
the
president
wasn't
given
the
additional
power
to
reenact
statutes,
to
put
a
repealed
statute
back
on
the
book.
the
waiver
was
just
like
the
ewsaa
waiver,
where
the
president
was
authorized
to
waiver
with
respect
to
iraq
existing
privileges
--
existing
provisions
of
law.
but
again,
to
the
extent
there
is
any
question
about
that,
title
1,
u.s.c.
section
108
answers
that
conclusively.
that
section
provides
that
even
if
congress
itself
had
repealed
section
1083
in
its
entirety,
that
would
not
bring
section
1605(a)(7),
which
had
been
repealed
by
that
section.
and
that
is
the
plain
language
of
1
u.s.c.
108.
obviously
the
president
by
exercising
a
blanket
waiver
authority
can't
have
a
better
or
more
effective
ability
to
bring
back
into
existence
expired
statutes
than
congress
itself
could
have
done.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
we
are
talking
here
about
a
waiver
applied
to
a
repeal.
i
think
the
temporal
point
here
is
that
the
repeal
happened
effective
upon
the
president's
signature
of
the
ndaa,
on
january
20,
2008.
that
was
already
done.
the
repeal
happened.
at
that
point,
section
1605(a)(7)
no
longer
existed.
it
was
not
in
the
u.s.
code.
the
president
was
authorized
then
subsequently
to
waive
existing
provisions
of
law.
and
here
i
think
that
this
--
to
allow
the
president
to
re-enact
statutes
according
to
a
waiver
authority
is
contrary
i
think
to
1
u.s.c.
section
108,
but
also
common
sense
as
well.
he
was
--
he
was
allowed
to--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--okay.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
well,
i
think
the
closest
analogy
that
i
can
give
you,
your
honor,
is
in
fact
the
precise
circumstances
we
have
here,
and
that
is
the
doctrine
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity.
prior
to
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
of
1976,
determinations
upon
foreign
sovereign
immunity
were
made
by
the
executive,
and
they
had
the
effect,
as
the
court
stated
in
the
republic
of
mexico
case
and
the
ex
parte
peru,
of
requiring
the
courts
to,
quote,
"surrender
their
jurisdiction",
even
if
it
had
previously
attached.
so
here
we
have
the
precise
situation
that
had
always
happened.
it
had
always
been
this
way
prior
to
the
fsia.
the
president
had
always
been
able
to
make
determinations
on
foreign
sovereign
immunity
that
would
have
the
immediate
effect
of
divesting
the
courts
of
their
ability
to
hear
cases.
now,
there
were
of
course
jurisdictional
provisions
at
the
time
that
conferred
jurisdiction
over
foreign
sovereigns,
and
the
court
had
no
trouble
--
and
this
was
150
years
of
practice,
dating
from
chief
justice
marshall's
first
recognition
of
sovereign
immunity
up
until
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
so
this
is
actually
not
any
different
really
than
what
had
occurred
before.
we
have
also
cited
numerous
or
several
examples
of
jurisdictional
statute
that
do
depend
on
executive
determination.
so
there's
really
nothing
particularly
unusual
about
that
as
well.
i
would
like
to
turn
at
this
point,
if
i
might,
just
briefly
to
our
alternative
argument
in
case
the
court
might
find
it
relevant.
this
is
an
alternative
argument.
it's
not
one
that
the
court
needs
to
reach,
but
it
is
certainly
another
basis
for
reaching
the
same
result
in
this
case.
and
that
is
the
simple
fact
in
2008
section
1605(a)(7),
regardless
of
what
the
president
had
done
previously
to
it,
was
repealed.
and
it
was
not
just
repealed,
but
it
was
repealed
with
a
simultaneous
bestowal
of
a
replacement
jurisdictional
provision
that
encompassed
every
single
pending
claim
that
was
then
pending
at
the
time.
so
this
is
the
classic
example
of
a
jurisdictional
repeal
that
applies
to
all
cases.
congress
didn't
just
repeal
a
statute,
but
it
gave
another
provision
that
encompassed
every
pending
claim
and
allowed
every
single
pending
plaintiff
to
be
able
to
refile
their
cases.
now,
to
be
sure,
the
plaintiffs
against
iraq
were
not
able
to
exercise
their
ability
under
the
new
statute
--
that
is
28
u.s.c.
section
1605(a)
--
but
the
only
reason
they
were
not
allowed
to
do
that
was
the
president's
waiver,
and
the
president's
waiver
was
expressly
made
applicable
both
to
pending
cases
and
to
preexisting
claims.
so,
for
both
of
those
reasons
the
alternative
ground
is
also
one
that
warrants
reversal.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
there
is
at
least
two
that
i
am
aware
of,
two
default
judgments.
they
are
cited
in
our
brief.
and
the
effective
ability
of
those
default
judgment
creditors,
as
it
were,
to
execute
on
those
judgments
would
depend
on
the
application
of
the
new
statutes
that
congress
enacted
about
judgment
execution.
those
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
but
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
there
were
at
least
two
judgments
that
i
am
aware
of
that
were
default
judgments
where
iraq
had
not
appeared
and
did
not
contest
the
case.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
we
are
not
claiming
in
this
--
in
this
proceeding
they
could
be
reopened.
we're
actually
not
claiming
--
we
haven't
claimed
in
any
proceeding
that
they
can
be
reopened.
but
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
plaintiffs
would
be
able
to
execute
in
the
united
states
on
those
judgments.
also,
they
are
default
judgments
and
so
they
are
subject
to
all
of
the
usual
rules
to
the
extent
about
reopening
default
judgments,
not
on
the
grounds
of
this
sovereign
immunity
issue,
but
on
the
normal
grounds
of
reopening
of
default
judgments.
so,
to
the
extent
there
are
such
bases,
i
don't
want
to
give
up
on
those.
but
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
making
--
this
argument's
immunity
argument
today
applies
to
these
pending
cases
and
the
ability
of
courts
to
enter
judgments,
not
to
existing
default
judgments,
but
the
execution
on
those
judgments
may
well
be
affected
by
the
arguments
we
are
making
today.
in
the
final
analysis,
i
think
this
--
this
is
a
case
that
turns
ultimately
on
the
president's
exercise
of
his
foreign
affairs
powers
as
delegated
to
him
by
congress.
the
court
has
traditionally
given
the
executive
a
fair
amount
of
leeway
and
deference
in
this
field.
in
this
case
i
think
that's
particularly
appropriate,
given
that
these
foreign
policies
are
among
the
most
significant
facing
the
united
states
today.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
no,
it
doesn't
depend
on
it,
but
i
do
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
president
was
acting
in
that
--
in
that
field
when
he
made
these
determinations,
and
to
also
recognize
that
these
determinations
--
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
has
not
changed.
it
is
still
towards
supporting
the
people
of
iraq
and
it's
supporting
the
ability
of
the
people
to
rebuild
their
country
and
also
their
new
democratic
government,
and
all
of
those
policies
would
be
thwarted
or
seriously
disrupted
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
iraq's
sovereign
immunity
has
been
abrogated
in
these
cases.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
that
is
the
way
that
these
kinds
of
claims
have
always
been
addressed
in
the
past
and
these
are
the
way
that
these
kinds
of
claims,
particularly
between
friendly
allies,
ought
to
be
addressed.
and
i
would
think
that
in
this
instance
the
court
in
its
republic
of
peru
case
probably
said
it
best
and
i'm
just
going
to
quote
from
the
last
page
of
our
brief.
the
court
said:
"our
national
interest
will
be
better
served
in
such
cases
if
the
wrongs
to
suitors
involving
our
relations
with
a
friendly
foreign
power
are
righted
through
diplomatic
negotiations
rather
than
the
compulsions
of
judicial
proceedings.
"
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
that
is
true,
but
this
case
involve
the
doctrine
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity
and
it
embodies
the
same
concerns
of
reciprocity
that
were
at
issue
then.
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
thank
you,
your
honor--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
it
is
not
the
position
of
the
government
of
iraq
that
in
the
very
hypothetical
instance
in
which
something
would
change
that
they
could
not
be
redesignated.
we
believe
they
could
be
redesignated.
we
believe
that
is
also
the
position
of
the
united
states.
when
we
say
"permanent",
we
mean
as
opposed
to
just
temporary.
and
i
might
add
it
is
our
position
that--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--it
is
our
position
that
it
will
be
permanent
because
the
government
of
iraq
is
now
a
very
strong
ally
of
the
united
states
in
the
fight
against
terrorism,
not
a
sponsor
of
it.
just
a
few
other
points
based
on
the
argument
that
just
occurred.
they
are
interpreting
the
statute
apparently
now
to
say
that
the
president
only
had
the
power
to
rescind
the
--
the
previous
designations,
but
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
if
that's
what
congress
had
meant,
they
would
have
done
that.
they
said
"make
inapplicable".
and
their
entire
case
depends
on
that
statute
being
applicable
today
because
it
serves
as
the
abrogation
of
iraq's
sovereign
immunity,
and
it
serves
as
the
predicate
for
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
it
cannot
be
both
applicable
and
having
been
made
inapplicable.
the
other
point
that
was
mentioned
--
and
also
i
would
also
say
in
this
regard
that
our
foreign
policy
towards
iraq
is
different
than
our
foreign
policy
towards
other
former
state-sponsored
terrorism.
libya,
for
example,
was
taken
off
the
list,
but
there
was
an
express
requirement
that
libya
answer
to
the
claims
that
were
before
it.
and,
of
course,
that
was
because
the
--
the
government
that
sponsored
that
terrorism,
the
--
the
khadafi
government,
was
still
in
power.
here
we
had
gone
into
the
country
with
u.s.
military
force
aided
by
our
allies,
and
we
have
ousted
the
regime,
and
we
were
seeking
to
support
iraq
in
its
efforts
to
rebuild.
there
was
a
point
about
the
de-designation
that
was
done
in
2004.
the
secretary
of
state
--
and
it
is
cited
on
page
25
in
the
blue
brief.
the
secretary
of
state
said
in
the
de-designation
that
it
was
largely
symbolic
or
perhaps
a
belt
and
suspenders,
but
he
said
it
was
largely
symbolic
in
light
of
the
prior
ewsaa
determination.
however
--
and
this
is
relevant
to
something
else
that
occurred.
the
de-designation
was
also
necessary
to
allow
military
exports
to
iraq
because
under
the
proviso
3
of
the
ewsaa,
military
exports
were
specifically
exempted
from
the
president's
authority.
that
also
shows
that
congress
knew
how
to
make
exceptions
to
the
president's
power
when
it
wanted
to.
and,
finally,
i
would
say
that
we
do
agree
with
the
analysis
that
justice
souter
has
--
has
posited,
and
that
is
that
this
involves
a
lesser
power
than
the
president
could
have
exercised
on
his
own
authority
to
--
to
completely
espouse
the
claims.
it,
therefore,
fits
entirely
within
what
is
normally
done
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
and,
justice
ginsburg,
it
is
also
the
position
of
the
government
of
iraq
that
iraqi
victims
ought
to
be
included
in
any
state-to-state
diplomatic
negotiations.
but
that
is
a
matter
for
the
two
governments
to
resolve
between
themselves,
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
these
kinds
of
claims
have
always
been
resolved
in
that
manner
in
the
past.
they
are
reciprocal,
bilateral
concerns
that
affect
two
very
close
allies.
those
governments
ought
to
be
negotiating
and
resolving
those
claims,
whatever
claims
there
are
on
both
sides,
between
the
two
of
them.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
your
honor.
