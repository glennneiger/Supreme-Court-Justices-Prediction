mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
ewsaa
section
1503
authorized
the
president
to
make
inapplicable
with
respect
to
iraq
any
provision
of
law
that
applies
to
countries
that
have
sponsored
terrorism.
the
terrorism
exception
to
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
falls
squarely
within
the
plain
language
of
that
authority.
but
if
there
were
any
question
about
that,
certainly
the
president's
exercise
of
his
authority
under
that
statute
would
be
entitled
to
deference.
even
if
one
were
to
add
the
atextual
additional
limitation
that
the
acree
court
majority
tried
to,
that
it
only
encompassed
statutes
that
would
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
the
funding
of
the
iraqi
regime
in
the
aftermath
of
removing
the
hussein
government,
still
the
president's
memorandum
to
congress
makes
clear
his
determination
that
the
threat
of
billions
of
dollars
of
judgments
against
iraq
and
the
seizure
or
freezing
of
their
assets
by
attachment
constituted
an
immediate
threat
to
the
foreign
policy
interests
of
the
united
states
and
our
critical
foreign
policy
goals
in
iraq.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that
is
because
of
the
authorities
that
the
president
exercised
under
the
second
proviso
of
1503.
there
are
exceptions
to
the
immunity
of
foreign
states
with
respect
to
attachment.
there
is
one
that
specifically
applies
to
countries
that
have
been
designated
as
having
sponsored
terrorism,
and
that
exception
as
well
was
rendered
inapplicable
to
iraq
pursuant
to
this
same
authority.
and
so,
again,
it
is
essential
to
the
government's
foreign
policy
interests
in
iraq
that
these
judgments,
the
ability
to
attach
iraqi
assets
--
in
fact,
at
the
time,
in
the
summer
of
2003,
there
were
plaintiffs
that
were
running
around
trying
to
attach
the
very
assets,
the
very
bundles
of
cash,
that
the
united
states
government
was
attempting
to
shift
to
iraq
in
order
to
pay
immediate
needs
in
--
in
iraq
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
having
removed
the
hussein
regime.
these
critical
foreign
policy
goals
would
have
been
frustrated
had
the
president
not
been
able
to
make
our
foreign
sovereign
immunity
law
conform
to
our
foreign
policy.
and,
of
course,
the
court
in
altmann
recognized
that
foreign
sovereign
immunity
is
an
expression
of
our
present
foreign
policy
interests.
that
has
always
been
the
case.
and
although
congress
can
establish
the
general
rule,
and
did
in
the
fsia,
section
1503
recognizes
that
there
had
perhaps
never
been
as
dramatic
a
transformation
in
our
foreign
policy
with
respect
to
a
country
as
happened
in
the
spring
of
2003,
whereas
there
had
been
a
whole
panoply
of
sanctions
and
other
provisions
of
law
that
had
applied
to
iraq
because
of
the
hussein
regime's
sponsorship
of
terrorism.
on
a
--
on
a
dime,
our
policy
shifted
180
degrees,
and
we
became
intensely
concerned
in
the
success
of
the
new
iraqi
regime.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
no,
your
honor.
the
judgment
in
the
acree
case
dismissing
the
claims
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
was
because
counsel
in
that
particular
suit
was
unable
to
identify
a
source
of
law
for
their
claim.
the
d.c.
circuit
has
correctly
held
that
federal
law
did
not
at
that
time
provide
a
cause
of
action
under
1605(a)(7),
and
counsel
was
unable
when
pressed
at
oral
argument
to
identify
the
source
of
law.
but
numerous
district
court
judgments
exist
where
the
courts
have
upheld
the
availability
of
transitory
tort
under
the
law
of
the
forum
state,
under
the
law
of
the
residence
of
the
plaintiff,
or
under
the
law
of
the
--
of
the
place
where
the
wrong
occurred
to
provide
a
cause
of
action.
so--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--that's
right.
and
--
and,
of
course,
the
courts
have
to
apply
a
choice
of
law
analysis.
as
i
said,
a
number
of
these
judgments
apply
the
law
of
the
forum
state
where
the
plaintiff
resided.
the
united
states
has
expressed
its
view
that
there
are
constitutional
limitations
on
the
ability
of
a
state
to
project
its
substantive
law
to
a
tort
that
occurs
abroad,
but
--
but
those
issues
have
not
yet
i
don't
think
have
been
resolved
by
the
d.c.
circuit,
at
least.
so
plaintiffs
have
successfully
obtained
judgments
in
suits
brought
under
1605(a)(7).
and
there
were
billions
of
dollars
in
claims
that
were
asserted
against
iraq.
and
--
and,
as
i
said,
plaintiffs
were
actively
going
and
trying
to
seek
the
actual
money
that
the
united
states
was
trying
to
transfer
over
to
iraq
to
pay
immediate
costs
of
the
reconstruction.
but
this
does
not
mean
--
and
i
think
justice
scalia's
question
was
critical
here.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
plaintiffs
are
left
without
any
remedy,
rather
that
these
plaintiffs
have
been
put
on
the
same
footing
as
any
other
claimant
against
a
foreign
state
that
is
not
on
the
very
small
list
of
designated
state
sponsors
of
terrorism.
their
claims
are
subject
to
state-to-state
diplomatic
resolution.
and,
in
fact,
there
have
been
discussions
--
there
are
ongoing
discussions
--
to
establish
a
framework
for
resolving
the
claims
against
the
hussein
regime.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
that
that
is
one
consideration.
the
united
nations
has
established
a
mechanism
for
funding
many
of
the
victims
of
the
hussein
regime.
and
--
and
--
but
the
united
states
would
have
the
obligation
to
represent
the
interests
of
the
united
states
citizens
that
were
injured.
but,
as
--
as
your
honor's
question
points
out,
there
are
a
lot
of
considerations
that
go
into
the
diplomatic
or
state-to-state
resolution
of
the
claim
beyond
those
that
would
be
available
to
a
court
to
consider
in
just
adjudicating
the
particular
plaintiff's
claims.
and
that
is
why
these
have
historically
been
reserved
for
diplomatic
resolution.
so--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--no.
no,
i
don't.
and
--
and
congress
has
established
as
a
means
to
deter
further
acts
of
terrorism
by
states
that
have
been
so
designated--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--the
abrogation
of
immunity.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right.
the
--
the
general
rule
that
congress
established
in
1605(a)(7)
was
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
would
continue
for
any
claim
that
arose
from
acts
committed
while
the
state
was
designated.
but
the
authority
that
the
president
was
given
in
1503
was
to
render
those
statutes
immediately
inapplicable
to
iraq.
and,
of
course,
it
would
not
be
inapplicable
to
iraq
to
hold
that
today
a
court
would
have
jurisdiction
over
iraq
and
authority
to
enter
a
judgment
against
iraq
pursuant
to
1605(a)(7).
it
would
be
application
of
that
statute.
so
the
only
way
that
one
can
give
full
effect
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
1605(a)(7)
became
inapplicable,
unavailable,
as
the
basis
of
exercising
jurisdiction
over
iraq.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that
is
true.
and
in
1503,
congress
restored
to
the
president
in
a
sense
a
very
small
portion
of
the
authority
he
had
previously
exercised
before
the
fsia's
adoption.
1605(a)(7)
on
its
own
terms
turns
on
determinations
by
the
executive.
it's
a
statute
that
can
be
turned
on
and
turned
off
by
designating
or
de-designating
a
country.
it
has
a
particular
temporal
consequence,
the
rule
that
--
that
the
chief
justice
alluded
to.
in
1503,
the
congress
gave
the
president
a
different
authority
to
turn
that
statute
off,
the
authority
to
make
it
inapplicable
only
with
respect
to
one
country,
iraq,
and
in
the
context
of
the
most
dramatic
transformation
of
foreign
relations
that
--
that
could
transpire.
