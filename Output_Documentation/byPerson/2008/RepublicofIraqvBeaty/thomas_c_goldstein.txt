mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
will
want
to
have
available
to
it
the
blue
brief
for
the
petitioners
and
joint
appendix
volume
2,
which
together
reproduce
the
statutes
that
are
relevant
to
this
case.
and
i
do
want
to
talk
about
the
text
of
the
statutes.
and
the
point
that
i'm
going
to
make
from
the
text
of
the
statutes
is
that
the
solicitor
general
just
correctly
described
to
you
what
it
was
that
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish
when
he
said
that
the
structure
of
1605
--
1605(a)(7)
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
says
if
you
are
the
victim
of
torture
by
a
nation
designated
as
a
state
sponsor
of
terror
and
that
designation
changes
so
that
you
are
no
longer
on
that
list,
then
you
still
have
a
cause
of
action
under
the
fsia.
the
fact
that
the
country
changes
its
ways
and
gets
de-designated
doesn't
change
that
result.
now,
what
the
solicitor
general
says
is
that
congress
changed
that
rule
in
1503
and
that's
the
debate
in
this
case:
did
congress
when
it
said
that
the
president
may
make
inapplicable
various
statutes
which
they
say
include
section
1605(a)(7),
did
it
change
the
basic
rule
about
what
the
effect
of
a
designation
and
a
rescindment
of
a
designation
was,
or
instead
was
it
giving
the
president
a
special
power
to
remove
the
designation?
if
all
it
was
doing
was
giving
the
power
to
the
president
to
immediately
rescind
iraq's
designation
as
a
terrorist
state,
if
it
was
a
more
modest
power
rather
than
effectively
writing
into
1605(a)(7)
1605(a)(7)
that
the
solicitor
general
just
cited
to
you,
that
changing
somebody's
designation
doesn't
affect
their
liability,
would
apply
here.
so
just
put
it
in
terms--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--let's
--
let
me
take
you
to
the
reason,
and
that
is
in
joint
appendix
volume
2.
section
620a
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
is
reproduced
at
344.
and
this
is
the
way
that
a
country
--
that
a
statute
relating
to
torture
and
terrorism
is
made
applicable
and
made
inapplicable
under
ordinary
processes
to
a
nation.
so
to
explain
it
to
you,
right
now
syria,
iran,
and
sudan,
this
statute
applies
to
them.
it
is
inapplicable
to
libya
and
north
korea.
and
the
reason
is
that
libya
and
north
korea
were
originally
designated--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
am
going
to
take
you
straight
to
the
text.
i
am
giving
you
the
overview
right
now.
so,
they
were
de-designated.
it
works
in
two
parts.
a
is
the
prohibition.
this
is
how
you
get
designated.
prohibition.
the
united
states
shall
not--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--sorry.
i'm
at
344,
and
i'm
in
a,
prohibition.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay,
this
is
how
you
get
designated:
"prohibition.
"
"the
united
states
shall
not
provide
any
assistance
under
this
act.
"
--this
is
our
principal
foreign
aid
statute
--
"the
agricultural
trade,
development,
and
assistance
act
of
1954,
the
peace
corps
act,
or
the
export-import
bank
act
of
1945
to
any
country.
"
--and
here's
how
you
get
designated
"if
the
secretary
of
state
determines
that
the
government
of
that
country
has
repeatedly
provided
support
for
acts
of
international
terrorism.
"
so
we've
designated
syria,
iran,
sudan.
now,
that
designation
can
be
rescinded
and
that's
usually
what
happens.
but
there
are
important
restrictions
on
the
rescindment
that
gave
rise
to
the
enactment
of
section
1503,
and
they
are
in
c,
recision.
the
congress
limited
the
president's
ability
to
immediately
rescind
the
designation:
"a
determination
made
by
the
secretary
of
state
under
subsection
a
not
--
may
not
be
rescinded
unless.
"
--and
there
are
two
rules.
it
can
happen
in
one
of
two
ways.
the
first
is
you
get
a
new
government:
"a,
there
has
been
a
fundamental
change
in
the
leadership
and
policies
of
the
government
concerned.
"
or
number
2,
the
old
government
changes
its
ways.
that's
2a:
"the
government
concerned
has
not
provided
any
support
for
international
terrorism
during
the
preceding
6-month
period.
"
"so
here's
the
dilemma
and,
justice
souter,
this
is
the
complete
explanation
for
why
congress
gave
the
president
the
power
it
did
in
section
1503.
"
"remember
when
the
ewsaa
is
enacted
there
is
a
whole
discussion
in
the
first
30
minutes
about
the
new
regime.
"
"there
was
no
new
regime.
"
"there
was
a
discussion
about
how
the
saddam
hussein
regime
had
been
toppled.
"
"no,
it
hadn't.
"
"when
the
ewsaa
had
been
enacted
--
was
enacted,
baghdad
had
fallen
seven
days
earlier.
"
"there
was
no
new
iraqi
government.
"
"we
would
not
recognize
an
iraqi
government
until
june
of
2004.
"
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
making
a
very
particular
point,
and
that
is
that
the
president
lacked
the
power
under
this
statute
that
i
have
just
cited
to
you,
620a
--
and
it
is
also
the
statute
that
is
cited
in
1503
--
the
president
lacked
the
power
at
that
time
because
there
was
no
new
government
and
there
wasn't
a
change
in
policy
in
the
old
government.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
exactly
right--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
couldn't
agree
with
you
more,
justice
kennedy.
and
here's
the
relevant
point.
in
the
spring
of
2003
when
congress
enacted
this
statute,
we
had
not
recognized
a
new
iraqi
government.
we
did
that
in
june
of
2004.
so
my
point
is,
and
i
think
this
is
very
clear
from
the
history,
congress
enacted
section
1503
of
the
ewsaa
because
the
president
was
powerless
under
the
existing
state
of
the
law
to
rescind
iraq's
designation
as
a
terrorist
state.
that's
what--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
well,
let's
go
to
the
text,
if
we
could.
and
that
is
in
the
blue
brief.
it's
in
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief.
and
it's
at
4a.
and
it's
the
second
proviso,
of
course,
and
it
appears
seven
lines
down.
"provided
further,
that
the
president
may
make
inapplicable.
"
--that's
the
language
that
we
are
going
to
focus
on,
justice
souter
--
"make
inapplicable
with
respect
to
iraq.
"
--and
then
it
identifies
the
statute
--
"section
620a
of
the
foreign
assistance
act
of
1961
or
any
provision
of
law
that
applies
to
countries
that
have
supported
terrorism.
"
now,
we
are
putting
aside
the
debate
of
whether
section
1605(a)(7)
is
such
a
law.
we
are
assuming
it
is
and
you
say
it,
justice
souter,
but
he
is
given
the
power
to
make
inapplicable
section
1605(a)(7).
he
isn't
just
given
the
power
to
rescind
the
designation.
and
the
question
just
--
the
term
u.s.
code.
we
have
to
figure
out
what
it
means.
and
the
way
that
laws
that
apply
to
countries
that
have
supported
terrorism
apply
or
are
rendered
inapplicable,
there
is
a
method
in
the
u.s.
code
for
how
they
are
made
applicable
and
inapplicable.
so,
to
return
to
my
examples.
if
you
were
to
ask
the
united
states
or
mr.
franklin
--
so
this
statutory
scheme
of
laws
--
sanctions
that
apply
to
nations
that
support
terrorism
applies
to
syria,
to
iran,
it
applies
to
sudan.
it
is
inapplicable
to
libya,
north
korea,
guinea-bissau,
britain,
france.
how
is
it
that
they
apply
to
some
and
not
others?
it's
through
designation.
that's
the
process
for
taking
something
that
applies
and
make
it
inapplicable.
and
i
can
give
you
a
lot
of
other--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
the
de-designation
becomes
effective
immediately.
what
--
the
distinction
that
i
am
drawing
is
that
there
is
a
strong
version
of
the
words
"make
inapplicable",
and
there
is
a
more
modest
version
of
the
words
"make
inapplicable".
iraq
and
the
united
states
say
that
when
he
made
it
inapplicable
he
in
effect
essentially
wrote
it
out
of
the
u.s.
code
or
wrote
in
the
exception
that
says
"except
for
iraq".
we
say
that
"make
inapplicable"
in
this
context
is
a
term
of
art
that
deals
with
designation
and
rescindment.
and
that
process
is
all
that
congress
was
trying
to
do,
was
to
allow
the
president
to
immediately--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
would
say,
no,
because
that
regime,
as
was
indicated
in
the
first
30
minutes,
has
been
profoundly
changed
by
the
enactment
of
the
fsia.
we
adopted
a
different--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
well,
i
do
want
to
come
to
whether
we
are
in
equipoise
in
just
a
second.
i
do
think
the
fact
that
congress
changed
the
model
so
that
we
don't
use,
in
effect,
the
tape
memorandum
model.
second,
remember,
justice
souter,
that
this
isn't
a
return
to
that
model.
what
used
to
happen
before
the
fsia
is
the
president
would
come
into
court
and
say
i
think
that
this
nation
has
immunity
and
the
court
would
decide
on
the
basis
of
that
case
by
case.
but
it
was
the
president
making
the
determination,
case
by
case.
this
is
something
unknown.
this
is
very
different,
if
i
could
just
explain
how
on
their--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
fine,
and
if
that
is
espousal
power
continues
to
exist,
then
the
president
can
attempt
to
exercise
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
so
the
--
two
reasons,
the
first
is
this
is
not
an
attempt
at
espousal,
unlike
dames
&
moore
and
cases
like
that.
remember
the
president
hasn't
set
up
some
sort
of
mechanism
for
resolving
these
claims.
he
is
simply
saying
that
they
are--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
souter,
it
wouldn't
work
like
that.
if
the
president
were
engaging
in
an
act
of
espousal
then
he
would
have
set
up
some
mechanism
for
resolving
the
claims.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
so
can
i--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
the
president
purported
to
do
that
nine
--
excuse
me,
five
or
six
years
ago
and
if
he
were
going
to
set
up
a
mechanism,
i
think
he
would
have.
but
can
i
just
then
just
come
to
the
premise
of
whether
we
are--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
so
let's
--
if
i
could
accept
the
premise
that
--
and
not
try
to
combat
the
premise
of
what
we
would
do
in
the
case
of
equipoise,
let
me
turn
to
the
question
of
what
statute
really
means
and
why
we
shouldn't
be
in
equipoise.
the
court
generally
has
not
assumed
that
emergency
appropriations
measures
issues,
particular
their
provisos,
changed
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
much
less
give
the
president
the
power
to
change
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
and
it
has
in
related
context
taken
language
like
"any
provision"
and
said
well,
we
are
looking
for
a
clear
statement
of
law
by
congress
to
make
sure
it
has
confronted
this
situation.
when
it
attempts
to
--
when
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
the
congress
has
passed
a
law
that
shifts
the
balance
of
power
between
congress
and
the
legislature
and
the
executive
in
cases
like
atascadero,
in
cases
like
raygor,
will,
these
are
all
cases
that
had
said
statutes
that
said
"any",
and
the
court
said
well,
because
this
a
--
a
relatively
strange
thing
to
provide
in
the
proviso
to
an
appropriations
measure,
for
example,
we
would
ask
that
there
be
a
clear
statement.
so
that
would
be
one
reason
that
we
are
not
in
equipoise.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
because
this
--
well,
because
what
congress
was
doing
was
confronting
an
emergency.
there
is
not
a
breath,
in
either
the
president's
transmittal
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
or
anything
else
that
says
that
congress
was
dealing
with
the
sort
of
medium
to
long-term
health
of
the
iraqi
population
or
the
iraqi
government
or
the
iraqi
economy.
it
didn't
--
one
thing
you
would
have
expected
if
that
was
congress's
intent
is
that
congress
would
have
dealt
with
iraq's
debts,
saddam
hussein's
debts,
and
would
you
also
suspect
that
this
wouldn't
sunset,
which
is
the
eighth
proviso
that
hasn't
been
discussed
never
much.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
oh,
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
that
that
--
let
me,
if
i
could
take
the
two
points
in
turn.
in
cases
like
atascadero,
will,
raygor,
it's
the
same
language;
it's
"any".
and
the
court
has
said
we
require
a
plain
statement
when
congress
is
going
to
do
something
that
would
change
the
balance
in
the
relationship
between
the
branches
of
the
government
or
between
the
federal
and
state
governments.
and
justice
souter,
we
don't
deny
it
goes
beyond
section
620a
of
the
foreign
assistance
act;
it
goes
to
other
things
that
involve
aid
to
the
iraqi
government.
what
it
doesn't
do
is
reach
pending--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
actually
do
disagree
and
believe
you
can
logically
look
at
the
statute
--
in
the
sense
that
the
word
"any"
means
"every",
that
is
true.
but
if
you
look
at
what
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish,
it
was
much
more
focused
on
questions
of
the
immediate
economic
impact
of
the
need
to
begin
reconstruction
in
iraq
right
away.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
am
saying
that
except
for
those
that
relate
to
jurisdiction,
because
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
would
expect
congress
to
deal
with
correctly.
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
in
the
first
30
minutes
is
has
this
court
ever
confronted
a
statute
and
construed
it
to
remove
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
without
expressly
saying
so,
is
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
if
it's
anything,
it
would
be
the
export
of
military
hardware.
in
the
immediate
wake
of
the
fall
of
baghdad,
when
there
is
no
new
government,
right?
there
is
no
replacement
regime.
if
you
read
"any"
to
mean
literally
"every"
then
you
could
ship
munitions,
nuclear
materials
and
the
like
when
there
is
no
state
there
and
it's
silly
to
think
that
congress
intended
that.
its
reasons
for
enacting
the
statute
had
to
be--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
don't
have
a
new
government.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
it's
not
--
it's
not
entirely
clear
there
is
still
a
government
in
iraq.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
think
--
i
think--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
justice
breyer,
in
--
the
same
point
was
made
in
cases
like
atascadero
and
raygor.
"any"
means
"every"
except
for
the
states.
in
that
example.
but
can
i
just
make
quite
clear,
we
have
two
lines
of
argument.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that.
we
have
the
debate
over
what
any
other
means
and
does
that
include
section
1605(a)(7).
that's
what
we
have
been
discussing
here,
and
the
idea
that
any
means
every,
and
congress
spoke
broadly
and
so
that's
what
we
have.
but
we
have
the
other
incredibly
important
arguments
of
what
it
means
to
make
a
sanction
inapplicable.
which
is
separate
and
independent
of
that
point,
and
the
question
of
whether
the
statutes
sunset
as
the
acree
court
did.
and
i
want
to
return
first
to
those
point
of
what
it
is
to
make
inapplicable
a
statute
that
applies
to
nations
that
have
supported
terrorism.
and
i
want
to
return
to
the
statutory
text
and
explain
why
our
more
modest
reading
of
"make
inapplicable"
is
the
right
one.
so
the
statutory
text
again
is
at
4a.
here
are,
i
think,
the
strong
statutory
indications
that
we
are
right,
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
to
allow
the
president
to
immediately
de-designate
iraq
as
a
terrorist
state.
first,
there
is
a
direct
parallel
between
the
language
"a
statute
that
applies
to
countries
that
have
supported
terrorism.
"
and
the
directive
that
the
president
can
make
it
inapplicable.
that
tells
you,
look
at
how
it
is
that
these
statutes
apply
in
the
first
place,
and
the
linguistic
term
of
art
is
to
do
the
reverse.
take
something
that
applies
and
make
it
inapplicable.
and
something
that
applies
to
an
--
statutes
apply
to
countries
that
have
supported
terrorism
under
american
law
only
in
one
way,
through
designation.
and
what
happens
is
that
the
president
was
allowed
to
rescind
it.
the
second
textual
reason
for
our
more
modest
reading
of
make
inapplicable
is
reference
to
section
620a
of
the
foreign
assistance
act.
so
we
know
one
thing:
even
if
we
debate
and
disagree,
justice
breyer,
about
what
any
means
in
this
context,
we
know
the
congress
told
the
president
he
could
immediately
make
inapplicable
section
620a.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
exactly
right,
but
that's
the
point.
when
i
took
you
to
the
text
of
620a,
which
was
at
344
of
the
joint
appendix
volume
2,
justice
souter,
he
didn't
have
the
power
to
do
it
right
away.
remember,
baghdad
falls;
there
is
no
new
government;
and
the
old
government
hasn't
changed
its
ways.
so
he
lacks
the
power
to
remove
the
designation.
and
i
can
prove
that
to
you.
it
wasn't
until
there
was
a
new
government
that
the
president
actually
did
formally
rescind
the
designation
pursuant
to
the
foreign
assistance
act.
it
wasn't
until
2004.
after--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
--
i
disagree,
but
we
will
accept
that.
mr.
chief
justice,
my
point
isn't,
hey,
look,
he
himself
acknowledged
that
he
needed
to
exercise
his
de-designation
power.
my
point
is
different,
and
that
is
the
fact
that
he
didn't
do
this
under
the
foreign
assistance
act
until
2004
is
a
strong
indication
that
he
couldn't
do
it
before.
if
he
could
have
done
it
before,
he
would
have.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
--
i
don't
understand,
justice
souter,
why
he
would
in
2004,
after
a
new
government
is
recognized,
suddenly
decide
to
de-designate
iraq.
there
wasn't
any
--
the
only--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
it
--
i
agree
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
assumption
that
he
had
the
authority
here.
that's
--
i'm
not
trying
to
negative
that.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
the
authority
under
620a
--
the
fact
that
he
exercised
it
in
2004
is
a
strong
indication
that
that's
--
it's
not
the
only
possible
reading,
but
it's
a
strong
indication
that
that's
when
he
thought
he
got
the
power.
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
solicitor
general
has
it
right.
post-acree,
these
claims
--
these
types
of
claims
were
pleaded
principally
as
state-law
claims,
and
that
has
been
recognized
as
providing
a
substantive
cause
of
action.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
state
law
generally
of
the
home
state
of
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
that
is
clear
--
well,
in
--
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
a
foreign
country
would
look
to
our
law
and
say,
well,
we're
just
doing
the
same
thing
as
you
do,
that
would
arise
from
--
also
from
new
section
1605a.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
i
understand,
justice
ginsburg.
section
--
for
example,
section
1605a,
the
statute
that's
created
by
the
2008
ndaa,
creates
an
affirmative
u.s.
cause
of
action.
there
is
always
going
to
be
an
underlying
domestic
cause
of
action
that
underlies
the
fsia,
whether
it's
state
law
or
instead
it's
federal
law.
that
is
a
--
a
debate
about
whether
the
fsia
is
a
good
statute
or
not,
but
it's
one
that
congress
has
resolved--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
justice
scalia,
the
--
the
source
of
the
underlying
cause
of
action
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
the
d.c.
circuit
has
resolved
that
question
in
our
favor.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
i'm
here
to
talk
about
what
you
want
to
talk
about,
and
all
i'm--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--all
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
maybe
i
can
finish
it.
the
--
the
--
i
had
said
that
i
also
wanted
to
continue
with
the
text,
on
the
question
of
what
it
is
to
"make
inapplicable".
i
pointed
out
how
it
is
that
all
of
these
statutes
are
applied
and
made
inapplicable.
i
also
want
to
draw
the
contrast
between
the
two
operative
powers
that
are
given
to
the
president.
at
the
beginning,
the
statute
says
the
president
may
suspend
the
application
of
any
provision
of
the
iraq
sanctions
act,
which
is
the
kind
of
power
that
they
are
talking
about,
essentially
to
lift
the
statute;
whereas,
the
term
of
art,
we
think,
"make
inapplicable"
in
the
context
of
these
statutes
is
the
narrow
power
to
de-designate
the
state
as
a
state
sponsor
of
terror.
but
let
me
just
return,
if
i
can--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
don't
think
the
question
is
presented
here.
it
could
have
been
an
argument
that
was
made,
but
i
don't
believe
it's
presented
by
this
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
agree
he
has
that
argument;
he
just
hasn't
made
it
in
--
in
this
case
--
in
his
--
in
the
iraq's
--
iraq
hasn't
made
it
in
the
cert
petition,
i
should
say,
in
the
question
on
this
court
--
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari.
i
think
to
decide
the
debate,
justice
souter,
of
whether
we're
in
equipoise
here
and
the
debate
about
whether
or
not
the
power
was
grand
or
instead
more
modest,
we
have
to
resolve
the
--
the
question
of
what
it
is
that
congress
intended
to
do
in
this
proviso
to
this
emergency
appropriations
measure.
was
it
confronting
a
very
specific
moment
in
time
at
which
baghdad
had
just
fallen
and
we
needed
to
get
emergency
--
emergency
aid
to
iraq?
or
was
it,
instead,
fundamentally
changing
our
policy,
making
iraq
an
ally
despite
the
fact
that
there
wasn't
even
an
iraqi
government
there?
was
he
given
--
was
congress
giving
the
power
to
the
president
to
immunize
iraq
permanently
from
liability
under
the
fsia,
which
doesn't
even
exist
with
respect
to
our
closest
allies,
britain
and
france?
that
is
a
significant
over-reading
of
what--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--because--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
don't
understand
how,
justice
souter.
the
--
the
powers
of
the
president
expired.
this
statute
sunset.
their
whole
point
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
fine
while
it
was
in
effect,
but
it's
not
anymore.
their
point
is
that
they
permanently
made
the
fsia
--
the
--
section
620a
of
the
foreign
assistance
act
in
2008
and
2009
inapplicable,
and
that
would
be
incredibly
unusual.
why
would
we
give
that
power
with
respect
to
iraq
when
we
don't
to
our
very
closest
allies?
remember
the
statute
expired,
and
they
say
it's
still
in
effect.
that's
their
answer
to
the
sunset.
it
makes
no
sense
at
all.
the
only
thing
that
makes
sense
is
to
read
it
in
its
context
of
being
a
modest
attempt
to
deal
with
an
immediate
problem.
and
section
1605(a)(7)
says
what
happens
when
you
deal
with
that
immediate
problem.
if
you
change
the
designation
of
a
state
--
if
they
become
an
ally,
if
they
change
their
ways
--
they
are
still
liable
for
the
acts
of
torture
they
committed
while
they
were
designated.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
don't
understand--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
that
--
that
entire
provision
was
waived
with
respect
to
iraq.
and
we're
--
take
section
620a--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
have
no
--
i'm
not
aware
of
any
provision
of
the
2008
ndaa
that
would
have
given
the
president
any
such
power.
they
say
that
on
the
day
the
president
exercised
his
--
his
powers
that
the
foreign
assistance
act,
section
620a,
became
inapplicable
to
iraq,
that
sanction,
and
that
that
inapplicability
survived
the
sunset
of
the
statute
in
2005.
how
it
would
come
back
--
how
it
would
come
back
and
continue
to
apply
in
iraq
in
the
case
of
a
regime
change
in
iraq,
i
have
no
idea
at
all.
