justice
antonin
scalia
i
also
gather
that
the
ability
of
the
president
or
the
united
states
to
seek
some
compensation
from
iraq
through
diplomatic
channels
on
behalf
of
these
plaintiffs
is
not
affected
at
all
by
this
outcome,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
long
section.
which
part
of
the
section--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
--
why
does
it
say
then
any
other
provision
of
law?
you
know,
congress
could
have
explained
its
more
narrow
purpose
in
a
few
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who's
paying
for
these
shipments?
i
mean,
is
that
a
real
problem
when
there
is
nobody
over
there
to
pay
for
them?
you
are
worried
about
--
about
armaments
producers
shipping
--
shipping
goods
when
there
is
nobody
who
has
ordered
them
and
is
going
to
pay
for
them?
i
mean,
that's
absurd.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no.
i
mean,
it's
also
a
debate
as
to
whether
the
call
on
that
question
should
be
a
federal
one
or
a
state
one,
whether
--
there
are
all
sorts
of
conditions
attached
to
the
--
the
suits
that
are
allowed
under
620a.
and
you
are
saying
that,
even
without
those
conditions,
any
state
--
oklahoma
--
can
decide
americans
can
--
can
sue
foreign
countries.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know,
but
we
have
been
talking
about
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
a
couple
of
minutes,
so
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
didn't
start
this.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
--
i
think
what
they
say
is
that
the
designation
remains
in
effect.
i
don't
think
they
say
that
the
power
to
undesignate
disappears.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
be
--
well,
i'll
ask
them,
but
i'd
be
surprised
if
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
clarify
this
last
part--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
have
just
been
discussing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you'd
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
two
cases
come
to
us
on
writs
of
certiorari
for
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
respondents
in
these
cases
sued
iraq
for
monetary
damages
based
on
allegations
of
abuse
and
mistreatment
by
the
saddam
hussein
regime
during
and
following
the
first
gulf
war.
in
order
to
bypass
the
immunity
from
suit
that
ordinarily
attaches
to
foreign
sovereigns,
respondents
invoked
a
now
repealed
statutory
provision,
28
u.s.c.
section
1605(a)(7)
that
stripped
sovereign
immunity
if
the
foreign
states
actions
giving
rise
to
the
claims
were
taken
out
of
time
when
the
foreign
state
was
designated
as
a
sponsor
of
terrorism
pursuant
to
certain
statutory
provisions.
iraq
was
so
designated
in
1990
and
remained
so
during
the
period
in
question.
iraq
argued,
however,
that
this
statutory
exception
was
unavailable
because
in
2003,
congress
authorized
the
president
to
make
inapplicable
with
respect
to
iraq
"section
620a
of
the
foreign
assistance
act
of
1961
or
any
other
provision
of
law
that
applies
to
countries
that
have
supported
terrorism."
the
president
exercised
that
power
with
respect
to
all
such
provisions
of
law
which
in
iraq's
view
included
the
terrorism
exception
to
foreign
sovereign
immunity.
but
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
and
allowed
the
suits
to
proceed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
consolidated
the
two
cases.
iraq's
reading
of
the
statutory
authorization
is
the
most
straightforward
reading.
the
terrorism
exception
to
immunity
is
a
provision
of
law
and
it
applies
to
countries
that
have
supported
terrorism
by
virtue
of
their
designation
as
such.
accordingly,
when
the
president
made
inapplicable
as
to
iraq,
all
provisions
of
law
that
applied
to
countries
that
have
supported
terrorism
that
included
section
1605(a)(7).
the
court
of
appeals
interpreted
the
authorization
more
narrowly
because
its
language
--
the
language
authorizing
the
president
to
waive
appeared
in
a
proviso
clause.
and
we
have
said,
pursuant
to
ordinary
english,
that
provisos
are
often
meant
to
clarify
or
limit
the
effect
of
the
proceeding
principal
clause.
they
--
they
are
often
used
that
way.
they
should
always
be
used
that
way
but
regrettably
they're
not.
the
authorizations
principal
clause
permitted
the
president
to
suspend
the
iraq
sanctions
act
but
the
proviso
purported
to
grant
the
president
an
additional
power
here.
not
the
power,
not
to
limit
or
restrain
the
principal
power.
we
therefore
reject
the
court
of
appeals'
reading
of
the
authorization
statute.
and
we
likewise
reject
the
alternative
unpersuasive
constructions
offered
by
respondents
before
this
court
which
i
will
not
describe.
a
subsequent
piece
of
legislation,
the
national
defense
authorization
act
for
fiscal
year
2008,
purported
to
ratify
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation,
but
that
statute
has
no
bearing
on
our
analysis.
it
was
an
extraordinary
provision
which
said
that
nothing
in
section
1503
has
ever
authorized
directly
or
indirectly
to
making
inapplicable
of
any
provision
chapter
97,
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
but
we
think
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
present
case
because
that
statute
in
turn
authorized
the
president
to
waive
its
application
to
iraq
and
the
president
did
so.
finally,
respondents
contend
that
even
if
iraq
sovereign
immunity
was
restored
by
the
president's
actions,
these
actions
sees
to
have
force
once
the
statutory
authorization
to
waive
expired
via
sunset
provision
in
2005.
we
disagree.
the
statute
provided
that
the
authorities
it
granted
would
expire.
that
is
the
president's
authority
to
waive
the
application
of
the
laws
but
it
did
not
unlike
at
least
one
analogous
statute
also
mandate
a
similar
expiration
for
the
waivers
issued
pursuant
to
those
expired
authorities.
as
a
result,
iraq's
sovereign
immunity
was
restored
when
the
president
exercised
his
authority
to
make
inapplicable
with
respect
to
iraq
any
provision
of
law
that
applies
to
countries
that
have
supported
terrorism.
the
courts
below
therefore
lost
jurisdiction
over
the
suits
and
should
have
dismissed
the
cases.
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
reversed.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
