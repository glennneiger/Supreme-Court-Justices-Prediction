justice
david
h.
souter
because
technically
it's
just
suspension,
it's
not
--
it's
not
reenactment.
i
suppose
you
could
say
a
suspension
is
a
partial
revival,
but
the
provision
doesn't
exactly
fit,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
agree.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
would
--
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
make
that
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
where
are
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
was
--
the
text
of
it
was
not
limited
to
rescinding
that
designation.
i
mean,
that's
the
problem,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let's
--
let's
assume--
justice
david
h.
souter
--for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
reasons
for
--
otherwise
the
reasons
for
and
against
the
point
you've
just
made
are
evenly
balanced.
we
are
on
the
fence.
don't
we
resolve
this
--
shouldn't
we
resolve
this
in
favor
of
the
president's
position,
simply
because
in
the
absence
of
the
statutes
that
we're
talking
about,
starting
with
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
the
president
would
have
had
under
the
foreign
policy
power
of
presidents
the
authority
to
stop
suits
like
this
dead
in
the
water
simply
by
taking
the
position
that
that
should
be
the
result?
so
that
if
in
doubt,
shouldn't
we
construe
these
statutes
consistently
with
the
traditional
foreign
policy
authority
of
the
president,
in
which
case
we
get
off
the
fence
and
we
go
in
the
way
of
the
petitioners
rather
than
your
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
been
profoundly
changed
if
we
accept
your
argument.
i
mean,
at
the
moment
the
question
is
whether
it
has
been
profoundly
changed
or
not.
we've
got
a
statutory
mess.
and
in
a
case
in
which
the
statutes
are
seemingly
subject
to
--
to
--
to
arguments
either
way,
why
don't
we
go
with
tradition?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
president,
quite
apart
from
the
immunity
designation,
the
president
had
the
authority
to
compromise
suits.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
know
whether
it
continues
to
exist
or
not
for
the
sake
of
this
argument,
and
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
making
that
point
for
the
sake
of
this
argument.
i'm
simply
saying
that
if
it
is
otherwise
unclear,
given
that
that
power
was
traditionally
enjoyed
by
the
president,
why
do
we
not
construe
the
--
or
resolve
the
equipoise
if
it
gets
to
that
point,
in
the
president's
favor
rather
than
your
favor?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
hasn't
set
it
up
because
he
thinks
he
has
got
the
authority
under
this
statute
or
had
the
authority
under
this
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
--
i
quite
agree
with
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
i
suppose
the
first
step
in
that
direction
is
to
stop
the
suit
that's
going
on
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
mean,
just
to
add
to
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
said
under
620a
of
foreign
assistance
or
any
other
provision
of
law.
clearly
they
are
going
beyond,
it
seems
to
me,
the
--
the
premise
which
your
argument
rests
on,
the
argument
that
you've
just
made.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
fine.
but
there
is
no
textual
basis
for
drawing
the
line
once
you
get
beyond
620a
at
the
point
you
want
to
draw
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
did
--
why
did
he
need
the
statute
to
do
that?
in
other
words
if
the
president
had
the
power
to
designate
in
the
first
place,
normally
that
assumes
the
power
to
--
to
rescind
the
designation.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
may
also
be
an
indication
that
he
thought
he
had
effectively
accomplished
what
he
wanted
by
--
by
acting
under
this
statute,
and
therefore
he
had
other
fish
to
fry.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
--
i
don't
know,
either.
i
mean,
i
can't
--
i
can't
read
minds,
but
there
is
an
interpretation
that
is
quite
possible
consistent
with
the
text
of
this
statute,
that
he
thought
that
by
acting
under
1503,
he
had
done
everything
that
he
needed
to
do.
why
he
had
at
some
subsequent
time
said,
well,
you
know,
i'll
--
i'll
use
belt
as
well
as
suspenders,
i
don't
know.
but
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
assumption
that
he
had
the
authority
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
--
why
do
you
say
"permanently"?
justice
david
h.
souter
just
under
--
just
under
this
statute,
if
he
makes
inapplicable,
he
can
rescind
the
action
that
made
it
inapplicable.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
--
no,
but
during
the
period
in
which
the
statute
is
applicable,
i
don't
know
of
any
reason
why
he
cannot
change
his
designation
of
inapplicability.
so
that
the
argument
of
a
permanent
change
in
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
or
the
--
or
the
powers
relating
to
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
doesn't
seem
to
me
a
legitimate
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
--
let
me
ask
the
same
question
with
respect
to
the
new
statute,
the
"capital
a"
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
there
be
--
and
i
just
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
this.
would
there
be
authority
under
the
"capital
a"
statute
to
undo
the
designation?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
he
waived
it,
but
the
question
is
whether
he
would
have
had
the
authority
to
undesignate
or
--
or
to
rescind
the
designation
of
inapplicability
if
he
had
wished
to
exercise
the
authority
under
the
"capital
a"
statute.
