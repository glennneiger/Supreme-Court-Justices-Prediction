justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
goldstein,
could
i
ask
this
question?
you
are
reading
into
it
the
exception,
of
the
words
"any
other
provision
of
law".
and
i
can
understand
your
argument
one
of
two
ways,
and
i
want
to
be
sure
which.
are
you
saying
it
means
any
other
provision
of
the
law,
except
those
that
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
courts?
or
are
you
saying
any
other
provisions
of
law
that
relate
to
foreign
assistance?
