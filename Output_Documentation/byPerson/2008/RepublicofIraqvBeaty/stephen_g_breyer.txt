can
you
--
i
would
like
to
follow
up
on
justice
stevens's
question.
think
of
three
categories,
a
is
the
category
which
you
could
see
that
other
questions
of
law
apply
to.
b,
is
this
case,
and
c,
is
the
other
--
other
things
--
other
things
that
it
might
apply
to,
but
in
your
opinion
it
would
be
absurd
to
apply
them
to
that.
all
right,
what's
in
category
c?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait,
wait.
after
saddam
hussein
falls--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
we
have
a
new
government--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yo
mean
some
period
of
days,
or
something?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
is
there
any
one
other
than
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
basically,
basically
your
reading--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
the
word
"any
other"
does
apply
to
any
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
except
your
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
possibly
this
thing
for
a
couple
of
days.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
isn't
exactly
an
absurd
result
then,
to
say
"any
other"
really
means
any
other
including
this
case.
