mr.
franklin,
even
if
you
are
right
about
that,
the
legislation
was
an
emergency
measure
with
a
sunset.
it
was
revived
for
1
year,
but
then
no
more.
so,
didn't
this
suspension
of
iraq's
lack
of
immunity
--
didn't
the
immunity
come
back?
didn't
the
bar
to
immunity
come
back
again
once
the
emergency
law
sunsetted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
including
--
including
the
provision
that
repealed
1605(a)(7).
so
that
would
be
revived?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
any
other
instance
in
which
a
jurisdictional
provision
is
withdrawn
applicable
to
pending
cases
without
congress
having
mentioned
the
jurisdictional
provision
at
all?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
were
there
judgments,
outstanding
judgments
that
had
become
final
--
judgments
outstanding
against
iraq,
that
were
not
challenged
on
appeal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you're
not
claiming
that
those
could
be
reopened?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
we
were
just
told
that
because
there
--
of
the
limitations
on
enforcement,
the
--
there
would
be
no
realistic
threat
to
the
iraqi
assets
in
the
united
states
because
the
judgment
creditor
wouldn't
have
access
to
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
--
is
all
of
this
--
i
won't
say
academic,
but
it
ultimately
doesn't
matter
if
the
d.c.
circuit
was
right
in
the
acree
case
in
saying,
well,
1605(a)(7)
allowed
suit
against
iraq,
but
there's
no
cause
of
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
the
wrong
occurred
would
have
been
iraq.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
any
such
settlement
have
to
take
into
account
that
iraqi
--
the
iraqi
people
themselves
were
the
most
numerous
and
probably
the
worst
victims
of
the
terror?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
that
there
should
be
deference
to
what
the
executive
did
because
of
his
role
in
foreign
affairs.
but
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
congress
deliberately
withdrew
what
had
been
the
executive's
traditional
authority
and
said:
president,
no
more;
we
are
going
to
set
rules
of
how
sovereign
immunity
will
operate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
statute
specifically
short-circuits
that
process.
it
says
the
president
may
at
once
make
inapplicable.
the
very
purpose
of
it
is
that
the
normal
process
is
going
to
take
time,
and
therefore
it's
being
replaced
with
an
emergency
measure
that
becomes
effective
immediately.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
--
why
shouldn't
we
treat
this
--
yes,
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
said
congress
is
setting
the
rules.
but
why
doesn't
this
emergency
measure
effectively
restore
to
the
president
under
these
special
circumstances
the
power
that
he
once
had?
congress
ceding
back
to
the
president
back
to
the
president
for
the
purposes
of
dealing
with
iraq,
the
authority
--
the
control
authority
he
once
had?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
goldstein,
before
you
finish
your
argument,
i'd
like
to
know
what
you
think
about
the
claim
for
relief.
the
d.c.
circuit
said
this
is
a
mere
jurisdictional
provision,
and
it
doesn't
provide
a
private
right
of
action;
the
new
statute
does,
but
that
doesn't
apply
to
iraq.
so,
what
was
the
source
of
the
claim
--
what
is
the
source
of
these
plaintiffs'
claim
for
relief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
--
which
state
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
--
by
that
reasoning,
people
all
over
the
world
could
sue
the
united
states
in
their
courts
alleging
that
the
united
states
has
engaged
in
cruel
and
inhuman
treatment
with
respect
to
their
nationals.
the
same
theory
would
apply
--
use
the
law
of
the
state
where
the
national
comes
from.
so,
it
could
be
iraq,
could
be
belgium,
could
be
yemen
--
any
place.
so
--
but
the
claim
you
are
saying
exists
would
be
a
kind
of
universal
one,
if
it's
--
the
united
states
could
use
it,
any
other
place
in
the
world
could,
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
looking
to
their
own
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
did,
and
you
can--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
can
go
back
to
your
jurisdiction
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
congress
could
pass
a
law.
[laughter]
