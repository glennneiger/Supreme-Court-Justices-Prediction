mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
this
case
comes
to
the
court,
two
things
i
think
are
uncontested.
the
first
is
that,
at
this
trial,
the
prosecution
suppressed
all
the
evidence
in
its
files
that
went
to
the
single
most
important
contested
issue
of
the
case,
and
that's
whether
the
defendant
was
a
drug
addict
and
committed
the
crimes
in
an
amphetamine
psychosis.
and
the
second
is
that,
as
soon
as
the
petitioner
found
out
about
the
suppression,
he
presented
his
brady
claim
to
the
state
courts.
in
this--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
a
couple
issues
that
you've
raised.
can
i
first
address
the
question
of
whether
it's
encompassed
within
the
question
presented
on
the
merits?
because
the
question
is,
well,
is
this
all
just
an
academic
exercise
because
the
procedural
default
holding
wouldn't
change
the
ultimate
outcome
in
the
case?
the
answer
is
that
it
is,
we
think,
fairly
encompassed
within
the
question
presented,
and
i
can
explain
why,
including
with
respect
to
the
text
of
the
question
presented.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
disavowed
deciding
the
merits
of
the
brady
claim.
and
let
me
take
you
to
the
petition
appendix,
and
that
is
at
page
22a
and
again
at
24a.
so
i'm
just
trying
to
walk
you
through
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
at
the
very
top
of
22a:
"we
therefore
will
not
disturb
our
decision
that
cone's
brady
claims
are
procedurally
defaulted
and
not
before
this
court.
"
and
then
on
24a,
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
full
paragraph,
the
last
sentence:
"we
again
find
that
cone's
claims
are
procedurally
defaulted
and
we
reject
cone's
request
to
reconsider
his
brady
claims.
"
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
not
going
to
stop,
and
i
was
going
to
just
point
out
the
dilemma
that
i
faced
when
i
wrote
the
cert
petition.
so,
on
the
one
hand,
they
disavowed
deciding
it,
and
then
quite
clearly
there
are
some
--
there
are
a
couple
paragraphs
there.
you've
--
you've
stated
one.
the
next
paragraph
does
the
same
thing,
talking
about
the
merits
of
the
brady
claim.
so
here's
the
dilemma
that
i
faced
in
writing
the
cert
petition.
they
say
they're
not
deciding
the
brady
claim,
but
then
they
talk
quite
clearly
about
it.
so
i
expressed--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
disagree,
and
let
me
explain
why.
if
you
go
to
the
cert
petition,
of
course,
which
you
have
in
front
of
you,
starting
on
page
26--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
--
the
document,
of
course
--
let's
--
let's
talk
about
the
text
of
the
question
presented,
and
then
i'll
give
my
explanation.
so,
the
question
presented,
it
says,
is
"whether
petitioner
is
entitled
to
federal
habeas
review
of
his
claim
that
the
state
suppressed
material
evidence
in
violation
of
brady
v.
maryland?
"
we
thought--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
explained
why
it
is,
and
if
i
can
then
take
you
to
the
rest
of
the
body
of
the
cert
petition.
the
doctrine
that
i'm
going
to
rely
on
is
the
question
--
the
issue
is,
is
it
fairly
encompassed
within
the
question
presented?
so
--
the
dilemma
i
have
described
to
you
is
the
one
i
faced.
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
wasn't
deciding
the
brady
claim,
then
it
talked
about
it.
then
--
so,
in
the
body
of
the
cert
petition,
which
you
all
look
to
in
my
experience
in
determining
what's
fairly
encompassed,
there
are
two
headings
for
the
reasons
for
granting
the
writ.
the
one
is
the
procedural
one.
then
starting
on
page
26,
we
present
the
merits
question
of
the
merits
of
the
brady
claim.
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
can
i
--
can
i
answer
the
--
finish
answering
my
question
about
the
body
of
the
cert
petition
and
then
come
to
this?
i'm
glad
to
do
it
in
whichever
order.
i
do
have
a
couple
of
important
points
to
make
on
your
very
understandable
question
about
what's
fairly
encompassed
within
the
question
presented.
the
particular
place
that
i
want
to
point
the
court
to
--
so
starting
on
26,
we
lay
out
our
argument
about
the
merits,
and
then
footnote
6
explains
quite
clearly
to
the
court
--
the
court
sometimes
has
a
concern
that
parties
are
smuggling
questions
into
the
case
in
front
of
it,
and
that's
clearly
what
did
not
happen
here.
we
explain
our
dilemma
about
the
sixth
circuit
saying
it
wasn't
deciding
the
merits,
and
then
footnote
6:
"because
the
panel"
--
this
is
on
page--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--footnote
6
at
page
30
of
the
cert
petition,
sir.
"because
the
panel
disavowed
deciding
the
merits
of
petitioner's
brady
claim.
"
--in
the
language
that
i
quoted
you
to
--
"and
discussed
the
question
only
in
dictum,
petitioner's
counsel
have
concluded
that
it
would
not
be
permissible
to
state
that
issue
as
a
distinct
question
presented.
"
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sir,
the
--
but
it
was
disavowing
it,
i
think,
as
an
alternate
holding.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
not
clear.
it
disclaims
the
power
even
to
decide
the
brady
claim.
and
if
i
can
just
finish
the
footnote,
it
really
is
only
two
sentences
long:
"this
court
could,
of
course,
reach
the
issue
either
by
directing
the
parties
to
brief
it
or
by
recognizing
that
it
is
fairly
encompassed
within
the
question
as
described
in
the
petition.
"
then
the
brief
in
opposition
to
cert
is
only
about
the
merits
of
the
claim,
and
our
reply
brief
on
cert
--
if
you
go
to
page
4
of
the
cert
reply
brief
--
then
clearly
identifies
this
question
for
the
court
again.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
i
agree
it
was
perfectly
fair
for
them.
but
the
question
that
i'm
trying
to
address
--
and
i
apologize
if
i've
misunderstood
the
question
--
is
did
we
sufficiently
identify
for
you
all
in
the
question
that
we
presented
to
the
court
what
the
issues
were,
and
so
that
you
were
agreeing
to
decide
the
procedural
question
and
the
merits
question,
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--in
1980,
august
of
1980.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
very
soon
thereafter,
within
a
couple
of
years.
this
--
let
me
answer
that
and
then
make
sure
that
i've
resolved
the
question.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i'm
sorry?
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
he's
around
50
years
old
now.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
in
the
woodall
case,
12
years
after
the
crime,
justice
scalia
--
so
all
the
evidence
was
suppressed.
in--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--in
1992.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
in
1992
he
was
granted
access
to
the
files.
he
immediately
stated,
right
away
--
it's
uncontested
--
his
brady
claim.
and
then,
justice
scalia,
the
case
went
on--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
sir.
so
it's
--
there's
no
question
about
timeliness.
justice
scalia,
your
frustration
about
how
long
death
cases
is
perfectly
understandable,
how
long
they
take.
but
let
me
just
be
clear
that
this--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
i
took
justice
kennedy's
question
to
be
that
this
has
been
in
the
case
all
along
and
hasn't
been
finally
resolved.
there
isn't
a
final
judgment.
you're
quite
right
that,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
there
is
language
in
the
court
of
appeals'
very
first
opinion
in
the
case.
there
is
unfortunately
only
one
sentence,
but
to
be
fair
there
is
a
sentence
in
the
first
opinion
saying
that
it's
not
--
that
the
brady
evidence
is
not
material.
but
i
--
i
did
want
to
come
back
to
why
this
has
been
in
the
courts
for
so
long.
when
he
presented
it
immediately,
justice
kennedy,
to
the
state
courts,
the
state
told
the
state
courts
that
it
had
been
previously
determined.
it
--
it
no
longer
defends
that.
it
just
wasn't
true.
and
that
caused
the
whole
thing
to
go
off
the
rails,
because
we
have
been
trying
ever
since
the
day
that
we
got
access
to
the
materials
to
get
one
full
adjudication
of
the
claim.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
right.
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
seems
to
me,
though
you
and
i
might
disagree
on
what's
fairly
encompassed,
we
might
have
one
piece
of
common
ground,
and
that
is
it's
time
to
bring
this
all
to
a
close,
that
there
really
isn't
a
big
benefit
to
having
cone
4
and
5,
and
that's
actually
what
we
have
asked
the
court
to
do.
now,
we
are
not--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
--
we
do
do
that.
we
also
say,
however,
that
if
the
court
believes
that
the
sixth
circuit
has
reached
the
merits,
then
this
court
should
address
what
are
the
undefended
--
the
--
what
the
sixth
--
the
state
does
not
contest
are
legal
errors
in
its
assessment
of
the
merits.
the
kyles--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
first
of
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
--
we
have
two
different
sets
of
errors
that
we
think
exist
with
respect
to
the
brady
claim.
i'm
not
avoiding
the
question
of
whether
it's
encompassed,
and
i'll
come
back
to
it.
but
to
your
first
point,
we
do
identify
what
we
think
are
clear
legal
mistakes
by
the
lower
courts
in
--
whether
it's
a
holding
or
dictum,
not
to
get
into
--
enter
into
that
debate.
we
explain
that
the
sixth
circuit
avowedly
split
the
evidence
into
sort
of
four
different
silos
or
categories,
and
we
think
inconsistently
with
kyles
v.
whitley,
and
we
think
the
lower
courts
were
wrong
not
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing.
now,
those
aren't
fact-bound
points;
those
are
questions
of
law,
so
we
believe
that
it
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
for
this
court
to
decide
the
procedural
question.
the
procedural
holding
of
the
sixth
circuit
is
not
defended
here,
the
idea
that
previous
determination
amounts
to
a
procedural
default.
and
then
on
the
question
of
the
merits,
the
court
could
decide
those
two
limited
legal
questions
and
leave
it
to
the
lower
courts
to
decide
the
more
fact-bound
questions.
but
we
do
think
that
the
court
--
it
is
actually
quite
sensible
for
this
court
to
not
just
decide
the
procedural
question,
given
that
at
the
very
least
--
call
it
a
holding,
call
it
dictum
--
the
sixth
circuit
has
sent
strong
signals
about
what
it
views
regarding
the
merits
of
the
brady
claim.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
sir,
that
--
that
is
something
that
the
court
can
do.
we
explained
in
the
preceding
pages
what
would
happen
in
the
district
court,
and
that
is
we
think
that
there
needs
to
be
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
that
the
--
the
court
should
point
out
the
kyles
error.
but
in
all
events,
that
would
still
be
a
sufficient
ground
for
reversal.
but
i
think
we
could
all
agree--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
would
have,
although
i
would
have
--
i
understand
your
concern
about
whether
it
was
fully
elaborated
and
sufficiently
so.
this
of
course
was
not
the
procedural
default
theory
that
has
been
argued
in
this
case
before
now.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
insofar
as
the
defendant,
mr.
cone,
told
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
paragraph
35
and
paragraph
41,
the
court
of
appeals
should
look
at
the
affidavit.
it
did
not
say
what
the
contents
of
the
affidavit
was
as
to
the
brady
claim.
now,
i
will
point
you
to
one
particular
point,
justice
alito,
on
the
question
of
whether
we
fairly
preserved
this
in
the
state
court
of
criminal
appeals
--
i
guess
two
points
that
hopefully
will
give
you
some
comfort
there.
the
first
is
that
in
the
entire
long
course
of
this
litigation,
the
state
has
never
before
made
this
argument,
and
the
second
is
in
the
tennessee
supreme
court
--
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
decides
the
case.
we
take
the
brady
claim
up
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court.
and
even
there
the
state
doesn't
say
that
it
was
insufficiently
preserved.
they
file
a
response
to
our
application
and
they
address
it
as
to
its
substance.
they
never
made
this
argument
even
in
the
state
courts.
and
so
i
think
it
--
it
could
have
been
better
briefed.
the
reason
--
by
the
way,
let
me
just
explain
to
you
why--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
--
it
--
i
don't
think
there
were--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
--
but
when
we
got
to
my
point
in
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
there
was
much
less
action
in
the
case.
the
brady
claim
was
point
3.
there
was
a
lot
less
that
was
presented
in
the
case.
look,
i
don't
think
--
my
point
is
not
to
say
that
the
state,
you
know,
inexplicably
behaved
horribly
here.
there
could
have
been
better
briefing
on
both
sides
of
this
thing.
what
i'm
saying
here,
though,
is
that
the
petitioner
right
away
presented
what
is
a
very
serious
brady
claim
to
the
state
courts.
he
didn't
abandon
it;
he
fully
presented
it;
and
what
he
wants
is
one
shot.
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
there
are
two
--
three
sentences
in
the
second
opinion
and
one
sentence
in
the
first
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit.
but
nobody
has
sat
down
and
done
this
and
disposed
of
the
merits
of
this
claim
as
anything
other
than
a
--
an
aside,
and
it
is
a
very
serious
claim.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
this
is,
i
think,
similar
to
the
bell
v.
kelly
question,
the
case
that
the
court
dig'ed
on
when
you
present
a
brady
claim
and
the
state
courts
evaluate
the
merits
of
that
brady
claim,
and
then
you
find
out
other
material
later,
and
the
question
becomes,
how
much
deference
you
owe
to
the
state
courts
the
--
the
first
go-around.
this
is
a
very
different
case.
the
--
all
of
this
evidence
in
the
file
appeared
at
one
time.
there
weren't
--
it
wasn't
split,
and
the
only
time
a
brady
claim
was
disposed
of
was
at
the
time
this
brady
claim
was
disposed
of.
after
the
woodall
files
that
you
mentioned
became
available
to
the
petitioner,
right
then
and
there,
he
added
--
there
was
paragraph
35
and
paragraph
41
of
his
post-conviction
application
that
were
added
within
a
couple
months
of
each
other.
the
state
court
right
away,
at
the
urging
of
the
state,
said,
oh,
that's
been
previously
determined,
and
i
won't
consider
the
merits.
so
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
state
court
has
assessed
a
brady
claim
and
said
we
don't
think
there's
any
brady
issue
here.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
don't
know
that
he
made
a
concrete
proposal.
i
think
he
would
prefer
--
i
think
the
court
system
would
prefer
it,
and
i
think
everyone
would
prefer
it.
the
dilemma
is
that
it
can't
happen.
the
--
as
we
explain
in
footnote
3
at
page
26
of
our
reply
brief,
there
is
no
window
of
opportunity
to
send
the
state
--
the
case
back
to
the
state.
it's
been
dismissed
there.
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run.
and
in
a
case
called
harris
v.
state,
the
tennessee
supreme
court
said
that
you
couldn't
reopen
it.
and
so
we
--
we're
not
saying
we
want
a
federal
judge
rather
than
a
state
judge.
we're
just
saying
we
want
a
judge,
and
our
problem
is
that,
understanding
that
there
has
been
some
discussion
of
the
merits,
it
has
been
very
thin--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
it
did.
and
so
we
have
--
we
did
try
to
present
it
to
the
sixth
circuit.
the
sixth
circuit
accepted
a
finding
of
procedural
default
that
is
undefended
in
this
court,
and
i
did
want
to
--
i
had
just
started
to
get
to
this--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
wasn't
a
friendly
question--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
wasn't
a
friendly
question,
but
it
was
an
honest
answer.
[laughter]
and
we
did
present
the
question
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
think
when
it
said
we
don't
have
the
power,
it
was
disavowing
it.
but
even
--
mr.
chief
justice,
even
assuming
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
a
whole
section
in
its
opinion
saying,
we're
deciding
the
merits
of
the
brady
claim,
my
constraint
was,
in
--
in
framing
the
question
presented,
as
i
explained
in
that
footnote
in
the
cert
petition
--
and
i
would
also
encourage
you
to
read
--
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
get
to
the
language
in
it.
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
a
whole
paragraph
that
explains
--
this
is
at
page
4
--
"first,
even
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
reached
the
merits
of
petitioner's
brady
claim,
notwithstanding
the
sixth
circuit's
own
repeated
disavowals
of
doing
so,
then
the
merits
of
that
brady
claim
ruling
would
be
properly
before
this
court,
not
immunized
from
review.
"
"indeed,
the
brady
issue,
as
encompassed
within
the
questions
presented,
would
be
properly
briefed
by
the
parties
if
certiorari
were
granted.
"
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it's
--
i
don't
think,
pejorative
or
not,
that
it's
fair
to
accuse
us
of
--
of
smuggling
it.
there's
a
big
section
in
the
cert
petition
about
it.
it's
not
--
it
was
not
hidden
from
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
purport
to
tell
the
court
what
it
was
thinking
when
it
granted
cert
in
this
case,
but
i
tried
to
be
as
clear
as
--
as
absolutely
possible.
i
was
turning
to
the
question
of
whether
we
have
a
serious
brady
claim,
and
so
the
court
should
have
some
concern
here.
and
i
really
do
think
that
we
do
and
that
the
passing
observations
about
the
lower
courts
don't
fulfill
the
duty
to
assess
the
merits
of
the
brady
claim
fairly.
there
was
one
--
the
action
in
this
case
--
the
whole
reason
that
there
was
effectively
a
trial
was
the
question
of
whether
the
defendant
committed
these
acts
in
an
amphetamine
psychosis.
he
had
two
experts
that
explained,
because
of
his
post-traumatic
stress
disorder
and
his
very
heavy
drug
issue,
that
he
did
not
understand
the
consequences
of
his
action.
he
was
completely
paranoid.
and
the
state
went
after
those
experts
by
saying
he's
not
a
drug
user
at
all;
he's
a
drug
dealer;
when
all
the
while
in
their
files,
there
were
--
justice
kennedy,
to
distinguish
the
hypothetical
you
gave
--
fbi
teletypes,
police
reports,
witness
statements
from
before
the
day
of
the
robbery,
soon
thereafter
in
florida,
explaining
that
he
was
not
just
a
heavy
drug
user,
but
was
acting
--
the
witness
was
asked,
did
he
act
like
he
was
on
drugs?
and
the
witness
says,
yes,
he
did.
that
that
really
would
have
made
a
difference
in
at
the
very
least
the
sentencing
phase
in
this
case
to
at
least--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
ginsburg,
this
is
in
the
yellow
brief,
our
merits
reply
brief.
it
starts
at
the
very
bottom
of
21,
but
you
can
just
start
at
the
top
of
22.
and
as
to
this
question
--
so
we're
talking
here
about
the
evidence,
not
just
that
he
was
a
drug
user,
which,
i
think,
would
have
been
relevant
to
the
jury,
but
that
he
actually
was
on
drugs
in
august
of
1980
at
the
time
all
this
was
happening.
there's
a
robbery
--
there
are
two
robberies
here
that
precede
these
killings,
and
there's
a
--
the
first
one,
there's
a
statement
about
the
robbery
right
before
the
murders
confirming
that
the
petitioner
--
he
was
asked,
did
he
appear
to
be
drunk
or
high?
and
the
witness
says,
yes,
he
did
because
"he
acted
real
weird".
the
next
one
is
that
the
day
of
the
--
at
the
jewelry
store
robbery
that
immediately
preceded
the
killings,
that
the
petitioner
looked
wild-eyed,
and
then
soon
thereafter
a
police
officer
reports
in
florida
that
he's
--
looks
"agitated"
and
"looking
about
in
a
frenzied
manner.
"
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
don't
doubt
for
a
second
that
that's
exactly
the
argument
that
the
prosecution
would
have
made.
the
question
is
whether
a
juror,
in
the
context
of
the
expert
testimony
and
the
evidence
about
drug
addiction,
could
have
also
found
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
idea
that
he
was
high
on
drugs,
whether
you
can
have
confidence
in
saying
now
--
particularly
if
you'll
give
me
the
first
statement.
and
all
the
fbi
teletypes
and
the
police
reports
that
said
--
remember
this
is
not
just
a
case
about
suppression
of
evidence.
this
is
a
case
where
the
prosecution,
with
all
this
stuff
in
its
files,
goes
after
the
experts
and
argues
to
the
jury
that
he's
a
drug
dealer,
not
a
drug
user--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--there
are
three
witness
statements,
and
there
are
a
series
of
police
reports
and--
fbi--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--two
points,
justice
alito.
the
first
is
that
we
say
at
the
very
least
the
court
should
make
the
kyles
point
and
the
evidentiary
hearing
point.
and
the
second
is,
i
think
to
be
fair
to
us
--
given
your
point
about
this
is
so
complicated;
there's
a
lot
of
evidence
here
--
one
ought
to
compare
that
in
fairness
to
what
the
sixth
circuit
did,
and
the
one
footnote
that
the
chief
justice
has
talked
about
with
the
district
court
and
whether
they
really
did
take
a
hard
look
at
the
claim.
i
think
it
would
--
it
would
be
fair
to
us
to
say,
look,
there
are
some
legal
errors
here
that
this
court
can
correct,
and
then
the
district
court
would
be
the
proper
place,
if
it
decides
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing,
to
resolve
the
remainder
of
the
claim.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
deliberately
suppressed,
although
it
doesn't
matter
under
brady.
there
was
--
they
turned
over
almost
nothing,
and
this
was
the
heart
of
our
case.
they
knew
that
we
were
conceding
that
the
acts
had
been
committed,
and
our
defense
was
one
of
insanity,
and
it
was
our
only
argument
in
--
in
mitigation
of
the
death
penalty.
if
i
could--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
--
it
could,
and
that's
why
i
think
it's
very
important
that
our
defense
was
amphetamine
psychosis
brought
on
by
post-traumatic
stress
disorder
from
honorable
service
in
vietnam,
not
just
that
he
was
a
drug
addict.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
kennedy,
he
has
been
on
death
row;
he
is
not
in
solitary
confinement.
here's
the
dilemma
i
think
about
how
the
court
needs
to
dispose
of
the
case.
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
the
state,
which
is
unapologetic
about
having
suppressed
a
whole
bunch
of
evidence
and
about
having
misstated
the
procedural
history
to
the
state
court
and
then
to
the
sixth
circuit.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court's
business
is
usually
not
to
get
into
the
weeds
of
things
like
fact-bound
brady
claims.
and
i
think
that
the
court
can
accommodate
both
the
concern
of
the
signal
that
it
would
send
in
affirming
the
judgment
in
this
case
and
also
the
--
the
bad
precedent
it
might
set
by
getting
into
the
jots
and
tittles
of
this
witness
statement
and
that
witness
statement,
by
resolving
the
case
as
follows:
on
page
22
and
24a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
court
of
appeals
says
the
claim
was
procedurally
defaulted
because
it
was
previously
determined.
that's
wrong.
that
is
the
argument
that
was
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
should
be
reversed
on
procedural
grounds.
on
the
brady
claim,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals,
when
it
did
discuss
the
claim,
made
a
couple
of
big
mistakes
the
court
could
identify
and
send
the
case
back.
the
first
is,
when
it
talked
about
the
merits,
it
said
we
don't
think
this
evidence
would
have
mattered
because
there
was
a
lot
of
evidence
at
trial
that
he
was
a
drug
user.
but
as
has
been
discussed,
i
think
in
detail,
the
court
of
appeals,
because
its
assessment
was
kind
of
passing
here,
misunderstood
that
when
the
experts
said
that,
then
the
prosecutor
turned
around
and
completely
discredited
that.
and
so
i
think
that
colored
the
sixth
circuit's
assessment
incorrectly.
the
second
is
the
kyles
point,
and
the
third
is
the
possibility
that
we're
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing.
and
so
i
think
an
opinion
of
this
court
that
simply
dealt
with
the
undefended
procedural
default
ruling
and
then
went
to
the
merits
and
only
made
those
three
points
and
then
left
it
to
the
lower
courts
to
resolve
the
brady
claim
ultimately
would
balance
the
concerns
about
the
court's
institutional
interests
in
not
sending
a
signal
of
affirming
this
judgment
in
light
of
what
the
state
has
done
here
and
not
getting
into
the
weeds
of
the
claim.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
twice
said:
we
consider
the
--
the
four
different
categories
of
brady
evidence
separately.
and
then
when
it
did
discuss
them
--
it's
very
hard
to
tell,
its
discussion
is
so
passing
here
--
but
it
does
go
through
this
kind
of
evidence,
say,
the
fbi
files
or
the
--
the
police
teletypes
from
agent
roby,
and
it
says
that
wouldn't
have
been
persuasive,
and
then
it
turns
to
the
witness
statements.
but
i
would
also
say
that
its
overarching
point--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--on
page
57a.
"we
take"
--
"we
will
take
up
each
category
of
documents
separately
and
discuss
whether
they
are--
"
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no.
the
--
in
the
2007
opinion,
that
discussion
happens
at
25a,
and
here
is
their
explanation.
it
goes
to
my
first
point.
and
they
do
sort
of
then
turn
around
and
treat
them
more
generally.
"it
would
not
have
been
news
to
the
jurors
that
cone
was
a
drug
user.
"
"they
had
already
heard
substantial
direct
evidence
that
he
was
a
drug
user,
including
the
opinion
of
the
two
expert
witnesses,
cone's
mother,
the
drugs
found
in
cone's
car,
and
photographic
evidence.
"
and
that's
our
point,
that
that
was
discredited
because
it
came
out
of
his
mouth.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
there
was
one
photo.
it
actually
points
in
the
opposite
direction.
the
state
cites
it
in
its
merits
brief.
they
have
a
picture
of
cone
as
not
having
any
needle
marks,
to
your
point,
justice
scalia,
that
they
tried
to
prove
he
wasn't
a
drug
user
at
all.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
can
tell
that
you
quickly,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you.
