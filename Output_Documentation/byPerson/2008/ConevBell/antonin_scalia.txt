justice
antonin
scalia
how
--
how
long
has
this
case
been
going
on?
when
--
when
was
--
when
was
the
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
crime
was
committed
in
1980,
28
years
ago.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
when
was
the
--
when
was
the
--
the
conviction
and
the
sentence
of
death
pronounced?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
want
to
go
back
down
again,
for
another--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
old
is
this
--
is
this
defendant
now?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
claims
were
--
was
this
a
case
where
there,
what,
81
separate
claims?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
can
understand
giving
a
lick
and
a
promise
to
--
to
each
one
if
you
come
up
with
81.
justice
antonin
scalia
52.
close
enough.
i'll
say
the
same
for
52.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
--
you
know,
i'll
give
you
the
first,
that
he
appeared
drunk
or
high.
that's
pretty
clear,
but
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
you
tend
to
look
wild-eyed
after
you're
running
out
after
a
jewelry
store
robbery,
and
i
think
you're
--
you're
certainly
inclined
to
look
"agitated"
and
"looking
about
in
a
frenzied
manner.
"
when
you've
just
committed
two
brutal
murders.
i
don't
think
that's
evidence
of
--
of
drug
addiction
at
all--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
being
under
the
influence
of
drugs.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
was
conceded
that
he
was
a
drug
user.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
he
was
dangerous
because
he
admitted
the
murders.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
--
do
you
agree
that
the
prosecutor
was
arguing,
when
he
said
that
--
that
he's
a
drug
dealer,
that
he
was
not
a
drug
user?
was
it
--
was
it
conceded
that
he
was
a
drug
user?
i
suspect
it
was
not.
i
said
earlier
it
was,
and
it
seemed
that
it
was
not,
because
he
introduced
one
witness
to
--
to
say
that
there
were
no
--
no
needle
marks
on
his
body,
which
would
suggest
that
he's
trying
to
make
the
point
to
the
jury
that
this
person
doesn't
even
use
drugs.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
photographic
evidence,
if
you
know?
