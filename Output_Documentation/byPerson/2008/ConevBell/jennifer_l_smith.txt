ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
court
has
alluded
in
a
number
of
questions,
both
the
district
court
and
the
sixth
circuit
now
twice
have
resolved
--
have
rejected
cone's
brady
claim
on
the
merits,
and
we
believe
correctly
so
in
light
of
cone's
actions
in
the
day
surrounding
the
murder,
his
statements
about
what
he
did
and
why
he
did
it,
and
more
importantly
the
lower
court's
recognition
that
additional
evidence--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
been
any
--
any
finding
about
the--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--the
state
denied
that.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
there's
no
explanation
in
the
record.
there
has
been
no
finding
about
whether
the
evidence
has
been
suppressed
at
all
in
this
case
because
both
the
district
court
and
the
sixth
circuit
decided
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
materials
on
their
face--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--well,
again,
there
has
--
there's
been
no
finding
on
that,
because
each
court
--
and
i
think
more
than
just
in
a
passing
statement,
each
court
that
has
looked
at
it,
both
the
district
court
and
the
sixth
circuit,
have
looked
point
by
point,
especially
in
the
district
court--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--your
honor,
i
certainly
understand
the
court's
concern,
and
i'll
just
--
and
again
reiterate,
there
has
not
been
any
finding
on
that,
but
there
is
at
least
a
suggestion
in
the
record
that
some
of
the
evidence
on
which
the
petitioner
is
relying
at
this
point
actually
wasn't
suppressed.
and
we
--
we
noted
this
in
our
--
our
brief,
specifically
as
to
the
witness
ilene
blankman.
all
of
the
individual
items
on
which
the
petitioner
is
traveling
now
were
the
subject
of
cross-examination,
so
that
at
least
raises
a
question
about
whether--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--well,
your
honor,
i
can't
speak
for
the
prosecutor's
state
of
mind
at
the
time,
but
i
will
--
will
state
that
the
central
question
in
the
case
was
not
whether
the
petitioner
used
drugs.
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
from
his
mother.
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
from
his
own
mouth
that--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--that's
exactly
right.
it
came
through
the
state's
own--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--it
came
--
some
of
that
came
through
the
state's
own
witnesses.
and
--
and
the
--
the
argument
that
the
state
made
about
him
being
a
drug
user
versus
a
drug
seller
was
not
the
only
argument
the
state
made.
the
state
specifically
said
look
at
--
to
the
jury:
look
at
what
he
did
on
the
day
of
the
murders;
look
at
what
he
did
on
saturday
and
sunday
to
go
to
his
state
of
mind.
and
the
state
focused
on
the
--
the
goal-oriented,
the
purposeful
behavior
and
the
very
direct
behavior
that--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
excluded.
i
think
it
could
have
been
used
to
attempt
to
cross-examine
certainly
agent
roby.
but
agent
roby's
testimony
didn't
--
didn't
state
that
mr.
cone
was
not
a
drug
user.
mr.
--
agent
roby's
testimony
was
that
at
the
time
that
he
observed
him,
four
days
after
the
murders,
he
didn't
appear
to
be
on
--
under
the
influence
of
drugs,
and
when
he
saw
him
eight
days
after
the
murder,
he
examined
his
body
and
there
were
no
needle
marks.
the
testimony
was
very
specific
as
to
his
observations
on
the
4-day
point
and
the
8-day
point
after
to
the
murders.
same
with
agent
flynn--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--i
think
that
the
material
--
if
the
material
--
if
the
subject
was
immaterial--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--i
think
that
as
a
legal
matter,
he
--
there
was
no
--
no
need
to
turn
it
over
because
it
was
immaterial.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
i'm
unaware
of
any
ethical
requirement
that
he
turn
it
over,
and
i
don't
think
that
--
and
certainly
under
brady
if
it's
not
material
--
we
don't
think
it
was
material
--
then
it's
certainly
not
required
as
a
constitutional
matter.
and
the
reason
it's
not--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--well,
i
think
that
--
as--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--i
think
prosecutors
make
those
kinds
of
judgment
calls
all
the
time.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
well,
i
think
that
probably
a
prudent
prosecutor
would
err
on
the
side
of
turning
over
matters
that--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--that
have
some
relevance.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
certainly
ultimately
it's
left
to
the
factfinder,
but
the
prosecutor
is--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--well,
i
think
--
yes,
i
think
the
defense
ultimately
would
make
the
decision
how
to
use
the
evidence
that
comes
into
his
possession.
but,
obviously,
the
prosecutor
has
to
make
an
initial
judgment
call
about
whether
or
not
the
evidence
is
going
to
be
material,
given
what
he
knows
about
--
about
the
defense.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
i
think
that
--
that
falls
within
that
--
the
prosecutor's
judgment.
but
i
think
if
we
look
--
look
at
the
evidence
in--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
i
don't--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--no,
sir,
i
do
not.
there
was
already
evidence
before
the
jury
that
the
defendant
was
a
drug
addict,
that
he
was
a
drug
user,
that
he
was
changed
after
vietnam.
this
court's
own
opinion
in
2002
noted
that
he
was
a
drug
addict.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
i
don't
think
that
it
would
have
been
material
to--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--i
think
it
added
no
more
than
--
than
what
was
already
before
the
jury.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
no,
not
under
his
theory,
and
the
reason
is--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--well,
let
me
explain,
if
i
--
if
i
may,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
it
is
not
mitigating
is
because
the
--
the
entire
question
in
the
defense
and
for
mitigation
purposes
is
the
defendant's
state
of
mind
at
the
time
of
the
murder.
there
was
already
evidence
that
there
was
--
that
he
was
a
drug
user.
the
fact
that
he
was
a
drug
user
doesn't
say
anything
more
--
or
additional
evidence
of
drug
use
says
nothing
more
about
his
state
of
mind
at
the
time
of
the
crime
than
what
was
already
presented.
the
question
is
not
whether
he
was
a
drug
user.
the
record
showed
it.
it
came
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
state's
own
witness.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
i
think
that
the
prosecutor
overstated
in
that
portion
of
his
argument,
your
honor.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
well,
i
--
i
want
to
answer
your
question
--
i
will
answer
your
question,
your
honor,
if
i
could
just
say
one
thing
about
the
brady.
we
don't
dispute
that
the
material
in
question
is
relevant
to
the
defense
and
is
relevant
to
the
sentence.
we
dispute
that
it's
material.
we
don't
think
it's
material
in
every
court,
but
the
district
court
and
the
sixth
circuit
have
found
it
immaterial.
but
on
the
--
on
the
--
the
--
what
has
happened,
in
terms
of
the
procedural
defense,
we
have
confessed
that
there
was
an
error
by
the
state
in
the
--
in
the
postconviction
court.
we
agree
that
tennessee
law
does
allow
--
it
certainly
at
--
at
this
time
did
allow
a
petitioner
to
raise
--
to
file
successive
petitions
if
that
petitioner
could
establish
cause.
now,
the
prosecutor
in
the
course
of
responding
to
some
80
claims,
both
parts
and
subparts,
made
a
mistake
and
read
paragraph
35
as
being
similar
to
--
to
a
claim
that
had
been
raised
on
direct
appeal
and
argued
that
it
appeared
to
be
the
same.
that
was
an
error.
likewise,
the
trial
court
erroneously
ruled
that
both
paragraph
35
and
paragraph
41,
both
brady
claims,
had
been
previously
determined
on
direct
appeal
or
post-conviction.
we
have
confessed
that
in
our
brief
and
--
and
do
at
this
point.
now,
in
the
appeal,
the
petitioner
doesn't
again
raise
the
brady
claim.
in
his
principal
brief,
he
never
mentions
the
brady
claim.
he
never
even
mentions--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--in
answer
to
your
first
question,
yes,
we
don't
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
if
a
trial
--
that
if
a
state
court
refuses
to
consider
a
claim
on
the
basis
that
that
claim
has
been
determined
previously,
that
that
would
not
be
an
adequate
basis
for
a
procedural
default
in
federal
court.
but
we
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
this
case
presents
that
scenario,
and
every
court
that
has
looked
at
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
decision
has
read
that
decision
as
applying
a
waiver.
the
district
court
read
that
decision
as
applying
a
waiver.
and
if
you
look
at
--
at
page
112a
of
the
petition
appendix,
not
only
does
the
district
court
read
it
as
a
waiver,
but
the
petitioner
read
it
as
a
applying
a
waiver,
because,
if
you
note
in
that
first
sentence,
as
to
the
brady
claim
to
the
district
court,
cone
also
attempts
to
argue
that
those
claims
were
improperly
held
waived
by
the
court.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
the
trial
court--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--held
that.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
i
think
that
rule
holds
if
the
petitioner
has
made
the
argument
to
the
appellate
court.
here
the
petitioner
didn't
make
the
argument
to
the
appellate
court.
petitioner--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--well,
i--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
petitioner
has
been
getting
the
runaround.
the
petitioner
has
always
throughout
this
litigation
proceeded
on
the
premise
that
the
cca
--
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
decision
in
tennessee
was
based
on
a
waiver.
all
of
his
briefs
in
the
lower
court
and
in
the
--
the
sixth
circuit
reflect
that.
the
district
court
proceeded
as
if
that
ruling
was
a
waiver.
the
sixth
circuit,
in
its
2001
decision,
if
you
look
at
page
62a
and
62
--
63a
at
the
bottom,
the
--
the
sixth
circuit
specifically
said
the
tennessee
waiver
rule
is
plainly
applicable
to
the
brady
claim.
and
the
tennessee
courts
explicitly
relied
on
the
waiver
rule.
it
wasn't
until
the
2007
opinion
that
the
--
the
sixth
circuit
even
discussed
this
notion
of
previous
determination,
and
only
then
in
response
to
what
i
think
was
a
red
herring
injected
by
the
dissenting
opinion
that
somehow
the
--
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
decision
stood
for
something
different
than
what
the
parties
and
the
courts
had
been
reading
it
all
along.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--the
state--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--no,
your
honor.
the
state
has
consistently
maintained
throughout
the
habeas
that
the
--
that
the
brady
claim
was
either
defaulted
or
waived.
in
the
answer
to
the
petition,
the
state
presented
the
very
argument
that
we're
presenting
today,
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
relied
on
a
waiver.
in
the
--
in
the
brief
to
the
sixth
circuit--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--well,
i
think
to
understand
how
this
--
how
this
can
happen,
the
bottom
line
is
that
he
failed
to
demonstrate
to
the
state
courts
why
he
should
--
he
was
properly
before
the
court
to
begin
with.
and
when
you
--
when
you
raise
a
claim
--
he
buried
his
claim
among
a
hundred
other
parts
and
subparts.
if
--
if
he
had
a
legitimate
claim,
he
certainly
didn't
highlight
it
as
such,
and
then
he
--
he
buried
even
further
his
explanation
for
a
waiver
in
a
41-page
affidavit
filed
six
days
before
the
state
court's
ruling
in
this
case.
it
was
the
first
time
in
the
entire
case
that
he
mentioned
anything
at
all
about
access
to
the
prosecutor's
files.
then
when
he
got
an
adverse
judgment
in
the
trial
court,
he
never
even
made
the
argument
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
he
took
a
completely
different
theory
about
waiver,
said
that
waiver
was
personal
and
should
be
--
should
be
judged
on
a
subjective
standard
rather
than
objective.
never
mentioned
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
any
argument
whatsoever
about
access
to
the
prosecutor's
files.
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
argument
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
that
the
petitioner
had
failed
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
waiver
as
a
matter
of
law
as
to
all
claims
that
had
not
been
previously
determined.
so
that
holding
is
an
overarching
holding.
it
applies
to
every
claim
that
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
successive
habeas
position,
and
we
think
justified
the
district
court
--
it
certainly
was
the
basis
of
the
district
court's
default
and,
as
well,
in
2001
was
the
basis
of
the
sixth
circuit's
decision.
now,
regarding
the
2007
decision,
we
concede
that
that
decision
could
be
read
as
presenting
the
question
1,
where
this
court
relies
on
a
finding
of
previous
determination,
but
we
don't
think
that's
what
the
court
did
in
2007.
in
2007,
the
court
specifically
ruled
that
it
was
not
revisiting
the
brady
claim.
that
was
a
decision
based
on
law
of
the
case
principles,
and
to
the
extent
that
it
discussed
previous
determination,
we
don't
think
it
in
any
way
intended
to
modify
its
earlier
holding.
in
2001,
the
sixth
circuit
clearly
relied
on
the
waiver
bar,
and
that's
very
evident
on
pages
62
and
63a
in
the
petition
appendix,
and
that's
the
basis
of
the
waiver.
so
we
don't
even
think
that
the
--
that
the
situation
in
question
1
is
even
presented,
although
if
--
to
answer
the
question,
in
response
to
justice
alito's
question,
i
think
it
would
be
--
would
be
an
absurd
result
to
say
that
something
that
has
been
previously
determined
is
defaulted,
but
that's
not
the
situation
here.
the
record
shows
it's
not
previously
determined.
the
petitioner
has
never
argued
that
it's
previously
determined,
and
no
court
until
this
point
has
ever
even
read
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
decision
as
making
a
previous
determination
finding.
everyone
has
accepted
the
fact
that
that
holding
was
a
waiver
holding.
so
on
that
--
that's
the
basis
of
the
default,
and
the
reason
that
he
was
defaulted
is
that
he
failed
to
make
that
argument
when
he
had
--
when
he
the
opportunity
to
make
it.
he
could
have
made
it,
and
he
didn't
make
it.
he
buried
all
his
good
arguments.
even
on
his
waiver
argument,
he
was
making
inconsistent
arguments.
on
the
one
hand,
he
was
saying
the
claim
was
novel,
the
claim
of
my
post-conviction
counsel
didn't
discuss
it
with
me.
on
the
other
hand,
he
says
that
i'm
just
now
finding
out
about
it.
those
are
completely
inconsistent
theories,
and
the
theory
that
he
actually
presented
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
argument
that
he's
making
now
or
that
he
made
in
the
district
court.
but
all
of
this
aside,
it
really
is
--
is
beside
the
point
because
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
district
court
very
clearly
addressed
--
and
specifically,
not
just
in
passing,
but
specifically
at
--
at
various
points
in
its
--
in
its
opinion,
the
materiality
of
each
and
every
item
of
evidence.
he
went
through
in
detail
a
discussion
of
the
police
teletypes,
stating
that
--
that
the
jury
already
was
aware
that
he
was
a
drug
user.
it
really
wasn't
any
question
whether
he
was
a
drug
user;
the
evidence
clearly
showed
that
he
was.
the
question
was
what
was
his
state
of
mind
at
the
time
of
the
murders.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
--
at
the
district
court's
opinion,
i
think
that
argument
could
be
made
based
upon
the
way
the
district
court
treated
the
items.
the
district
court
certainly
did
look
at
them
in
categories
and
separated
them,
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion,
certainly
in
2007
where
the
court
--
the
court
looked
at
it
in
more
detail,
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
court
cumulated
the
items
and
said
that
as
a
whole
that
the
brady
materials
don't
undermine
--
do
not
undermine
confidence
in
the
verdict.
so
i
disagree
that
--
that
the
sixth
circuit
treated
them
incorrectly,
and
--
and
i
would
note--
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
--your
honor,
i
--
i
think
i've
noted
earlier,
i
think
that
the
prosecutor
overstated
his
case
on
that
point.
no
question
about
it.
but
i
think
there
was
ample
evidence
in
the
record
indicating
that
he
was
a
drug
user.
this
court
even
noted
that,
even
noted
there
was
proof
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
drug
addict,
that
he
was
a
drug
user,
that
the
evidence
was
strong
that
he
was
--
that
he
was
under
the
influence
of
an
amphetamine
psychosis.
there
were
two
experts
that
testified
to
that.
on
the
other
hand,
there
were
two
experts
for
the
state
that
said
that
that
--
that
defense
couldn't
be
supported.
so
the
question
of
whether
he
was
a
drug
user
or
not
a
drug
user
was
really
beside
the
point.
i
think
the
prosecutor
eventually
got
around
to
that
in
his
argument.
if
you
look
at
the
argument
as
a
whole,
the
bottom
line
of
the
argument
was
--
and
we
quoted
it
in
our
brief
--
look
at
what
he
did,
look
at
his
actions
around
this
murder,
and
let
that
go
to
his
state
of
mind
because
that
was
the
best
evidence.
not
only
is
that
--
what
he
said
--
he
specifically
said
he
went
into
this
individual's
home
with
the
purpose
of
getting
fed,
getting
cleaned
up,
and
getting
out
of
town,
and
when
the
todds
ceased
to
cooperate
with
him,
he
had
to
control
them
physically.
that's
code
i
suppose
for
beating
them
to
death
because
that's
exactly
what
he
did.
he
explained
what
he
did
and
why
he
did
it.
his
actions
are
very
calculated
from
--
from
beginning
to
end.
so
whether
he
used
drugs
or
not
use
drugs,
the
question
is
what
was
going
on
at
the
time
of
this
murder?
and
by
his
own
admission
the
reason
that
the
todds
are
--
are
not
with
us
today
is
because
they
ceased
to
cooperate;
they
became
frightened;
and
he
had
to
control
them
physically.
i
think
that's
the
best
evidence
of
his
state
of
mind
at
the
time.
those
are
words
out
of
his
own
mouth,
and
i
think
that
that
certainly
supports
the
finding
of
both
the
district
court
and
the
sixth
circuit
on
materiality.
i
agree
with
the
--
with
chief
justice's
assessment:
we
do
not
think
that
the
brady
claim
is
fairly
included
within
the
question.
the
merits
issue
is
not
a
predicate
to
the
default
question.
i
certainly
understand
petitioner's
dilemma
in
this
case,
but
i
think
faced
with
that
dilemma,
he
should
have
squarely
presented
that
question
among
the
questions
presented
and
not
dropped
it
in
a
footnote
in
argument
2.
we
don't
think
it's
fairly
presented,
but
--
but
in
any
event,
it
certainly
justifies
affirmance
of
the
judgment
or
at
a
minimum
dismissal
of
the
appeal.
and
for
all
of
these
reasons,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
ask
that
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
--
of
the
sixth
circuit.
ms.
jennifer
l.
smith
i
don't
know.
i'm
not
aware
that
he's
in
any
sort
of
heightened
level
of
security.
i
would
assume
he's
just
at
a
standard
level.
i
don't
know
his
--
his
security
level,
but
he
has
been
on
death
row
for
the
entire
period,
your
honor.
