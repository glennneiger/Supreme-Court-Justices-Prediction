chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-1114,
cone
v.
bell.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
also
a
third
thing
that's
uncontested,
which
is
there's
no
brady
claim
on
the
merits.
that's
not
at
all
included
in
your
question
presented.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
there
was
no
brady
violation
on
the
merits.
i
don't
know
what
would
happen
if
we
sent
this
case
back.
they'd
conclude
it
again.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
don't
stop
there.
on
page
25a,
they've
been
talking
about
those
federalism
issues.
they
say:
"we
need
not
be
delayed
by
these
interesting
questions
of
federalism,
however,
because,
in
all
events,
the
documents
discussed
in
the
dissenting
opinion
that
were
allegedly
withheld
are
not
brady
material.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
don't
--
you've
resolved
your
dilemma
by
not
raising
anything
at
all
about
the
merits
in
the
question
presented.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
start
on
page
romanette
i,
where
is
--
where
the
questions
presented
are.
there's
nothing
in
there
about
the
merits
of
the
brady
claim.
it's
all
about
the
procedural
objections
that
you
have.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
--
i
guess
what
i
would
say
is
you've
got
federal
habeas
review
of
that
claim
because
the
district
court
decided
it
on
the
merits
and
the
court
of
appeals
decided
it
on
the
merits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
it
seems
to
me
you
either
did
not
raise
the
question
or
you
did.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
did
not,
then
we
don't
address
the
procedural
issues
that
you
raised.
if
you
did,
then
also
we
have
to
resolve
the
question
on
the
merits,
a
very
fact-specific
brady
claim
that
we
would
not
normally
take
without
reaching
those
procedural
issues.
so,
i
--
i
don't
see
why
the
procedural
issues
are
before
us.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
our
--
our
cases
clearly
hold
that
when
you
have
alternate
holdings,
neither
one
is
--
is
dicta.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
fair
for
the
respondents
to
say,
look,
there's
no
reason
to
take
this
procedural
--
complicated
procedural
issue,
because
we
win
on
the
merits.
and
the
court,
as
their
view
articulates,
the
court
decided
that
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
it's
--
my
questionings
and
--
questions
and
the
point--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
was
raised
about
the
time
aren't
related,
because
one
reason
these
things
drag
on
interminably
is
that
you
are
--
exactly
why
you're
raising
this
issue
here:
it's
a
procedural
nicety
or
a
procedural
difficulty
that
arose
some
time
ago
in
the
state
courts.
but
since
then
the
federal
courts,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
addressed
it,
and
--
and
that
that's
a
good
jurisprudential
approach
to
say,
particularly
in
a
complicated
case
like
this
that
is
26
years
old,
here's
our
answer
on
this,
but
so
that
we
don't
have
to
go
through
this
again,
if
we're
reversed
on
that,
here's
our
--
our
alternative
holding.
and
they
said
right
after
the
sentence
i
quoted,
we
said
this
before,
and
we
now
say
it
again:
this
is
not
brady
material.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
would
--
that
would
then
depend
upon
us
agreeing
to
review
a
very
fact-bound,
necessarily
fact-bound,
brady
question
when
the
questions
presented
focused
on
a
procedural
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
didn't
look,
counsel,
at
your
--
i
don't
know
if
it's
yours
or
your
predecessor
counsel's
brief
in
the
--
appealing
from
the
district
court
here
to
the
court
of
appeals.
did
that
raise
a
discussion
of
the
brady
claim
on
the
merits,
saying
that
the
district
court
was
wrong?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
was
--
that
was
not
a
friendly
question.
my
point
is
that
you
argued
the
merits
of
the
brady
claim
not
only
in
the
district
court
but
specifically
on
appeal
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
wasn't
sort
of
sua
sponte
addressing--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
brady
claim
as
kind
of
a
safety
net
on
the
procedural--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
no,
my
--
my
concern
is
not
that
you
didn't
brief
the
brady
claim;
it
is
that
--
whatever
the
non-pejorative
synonym
for
"smuggled"
it
in
--
is
you
smuggled
it
in
on
a
case
that
purportedly
presented
a
procedural
objection
and
a
conflict
on
a
procedural
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
smith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
goldstein,
you
have
three
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
anything
in
the
court
of
appeals'
treatment
of
the
brady
claim
on
the
merits
that
suggests
it
also
treated
them
separately
in
the
different
silos,
as
you
put
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
--
where
do
they
say
that
they're
only
considering
the
categories
separately?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
--
that's
the
2001
opinion.
do
they
do
that
in
the
2007
opinion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
goldstein,
one
moment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
you
raise
--
cite
kyles
in
your
petition
for
cert?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
i
see
it.
yes.
pages
30
and
32.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-1114,
cone
versus
bell.
