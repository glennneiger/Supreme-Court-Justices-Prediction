justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
what
you
asked
us
to
do
was
to
reverse
on
the
procedural
default
issue
and
remand
the
case.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
--
that
seems
to
me
to
be
directly
contrary
to
what
you
say
in
your
brief.
the
last
sentence
of
your
brief:
"this
case
can
accordingly
be
properly
resolved
more
narrowly
by
remanding
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
consideration
of
the
merits
of
the
brady
claim
in
the
first
instance.
"
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
--
on
the
procedural
default
issue?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
put
yourself
in
the
position
of
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals?
in
light
of
the
briefing
that
they
received,
if
you
had
been
on
that
court,
would
you
have
understood
that
petitioner
was
asserting
that
he
had
a
valid
reason
for
not
raising
the
brady
claim
earlier,
because
he
had
not
--
at
the
time
when
he
could
have,
at
the
time
of
the
prior
proceedings,
he
had
not
had
access
to
the
state
records?
would
you
have
understood
that
from
the
briefing
that
they
got?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
was
that
mentioned
in
--
in
either
the
principal
brief
or
the
--
or
the
reply
brief,
the
reason
why
it
wasn't
raised
earlier?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
is
a
very
complicated
factual
question.
it's
not
--
we're
dealing
with
numerous
documents,
isn't
that
right,
that
were
--
that
you
claim
were--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
so
you'd
have
to
evaluate
all
of
those
and
evaluate
the
prejudice
against
what
was
in
the
record.
and
you're
suggesting
now
that
this
is
something
we
should
decide?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
read
the
--
can
i
ask
you
this?
if
we
read
the
decision
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
as
having
ratified
the
--
the
district
court's
--
the
--
the
lower
court's
treatment
of
the
procedural
default
issues,
as
having
rejected
it
on
the
ground
that
it
was
previously
decided,
that
would
be
an
instance
in
which
a
state
court
applied
a
procedural
default
rule
based
on
an
undisputed
error
of
fact.
in
that
situation,
would
it
not
--
wouldn't
it
be
clear
that
there
was
not
an
adequate,
independent
state
ground
for
the
decision
and,
therefore,
no
procedural
default?
and
if
we
were
to
find
that,
wouldn't
the
appropriate
step
be
on
this
very
factual
brady
issue
to
send
it
back
to
the
lower
federal
courts?
