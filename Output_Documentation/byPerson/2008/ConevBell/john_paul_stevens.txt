justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
one
quick
question:
is
it
your
view
that
the
evidence
was
deliberately
suppressed
or
negligently
suppressed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
get
it
out
on
the
table?
do
you
agree
that
the
evidence
shows
that
the
--
this
evidence
was
deliberately
suppressed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
there
any
explanation
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
any
explanation
for
it
other
than
a
tactical
explanation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
relevant
because
if
it
was
suppressed
for
a
tactical
reason,
it
seems
to
me
hard
to
say
that
the
prosecution
thought
it
didn't
make
any
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
they
have
seen,
but
one
of
the
first
questions
that
always
troubles
me
in
a
brady
case
is
the
conduct
of
the
prosecutor
and
the
ethics
of
the
profession
and
the
whole
--
whole
importance
of
the
rule
is
to
be
sure
prosecutors
perform
their
public
function.
and
i'm
just
wondering
if
there
is
any
--
if
this
was
a
case
of
just
an
honest
mistake,
it
would
be
one
thing,
but
if
it
appears
to
have
been
a
tactical
decision
and
a
tactical
program,
it
seems
to
me
very
difficult
to
assume
that
the
prosecutor
thought
it
was
really
not
important
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
do
you
think
the
prosecutor
had
an
ethical
duty
to
turn
over
this
material?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
simple
question,
yes
or
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
my
question.
can
you
answer
my
question?
did
he
have
an
ethical
duty
to
turn
this
material
over?
justice
john
paul
stevens
twenty
seven
years
ago,
petitioner
gary
cone
was
convicted
of
murder
and
sentenced
to
death.
much
of
the
delay
in
the
execution
of
his
sentence
is
attributable
to
the
pretrial
decision
of
tennessee
prosecutors
not
to
disclose
various
police
reports
and
witness
statements
that
cone
contends
were
subject
to
disclosure
under
this
court's
decision
in
brady
against
maryland.
cone
first
raised
his
brady
claim
in
a
petition
for
state
postconviction
relief.
the
state
court
denied
relief
on
the
incorrect
ground
that
the
claim
had
been
resolved
in
earlier
state
court
proceedings.
the
tennessee
court
of
criminal
appeals
affirmed.
cone
then
sought
relief
in
the
federal
court
by
filing
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
district
court
held
that
cone
could
not
obtain
federal
relief
on
his
brady
claim
because
the
state
court
had
denied
the
claim
on
procedural
grounds.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
concluding
that
the
state
court's
dismissal
of
cone's
claim
was
barred
on
an
inadequate
and
independent
state
ground
--
ground
but
--
ground.
we
granted
certiorari
to
answer
the
question
whether
a
federal
habeas
claim
is
“procedurally
defaulted”
when
it
is
twice
presented
to
the
state
courts.
we
now
hold
that
the
state
court's
rejection
of
cone's
brady
claim
does
not
rest
on
a
ground
that
bars
federal
review.
we
therefore
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
make
a
full
review
of
the
suppressed
evidence
and
to
consider
whether
if
it
had
not
--
if
it
had
been
disclosed,
it
might
have
persuaded
the
jury
to
impose
a
noncapital
sentence.
the
chief
justice
has
found
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
