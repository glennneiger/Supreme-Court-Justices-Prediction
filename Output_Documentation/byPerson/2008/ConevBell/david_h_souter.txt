do
you
believe
that
the
materiality
judgment
is
yours
to
make
--
the
state's
to
make
as
sort
of
a
gate-keeping
measure?
isn't
the
materiality
an
issue
for
the
factfinder?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
--
you
exclude
--
do
you
believe
that
you
can,
in
effect,
suppress
any
piece
of
evidence
on
--
on
the
state's
judgment
that
it
will
not
prove
to
be
material
in
the
context
of
the
whole
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
that's
a
proper
judgment
for
the
prosecution
to
make?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
and
wouldn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--wouldn't
he
err
on
the
side
of
turning
over
the
matters
because
brady
leaves
the
materiality
judgment,
like
all
materiality
judgments,
ultimately,
to
the
factfinder?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
prosecutor's
obligation
to
make
an
--
an
initial
assessment
as
to
whether
the
evidence
tends
to
be
mitigating
evidence
or
favorable
to
the
defendant?
isn't
that
the
prosecutor's
judgment?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
this
evidence
clearly
of
a
mitigating
character?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
think--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
don't
think
it
would
be
favorable
to
the
defendant
to
get
any
evidence
that
justice
breyer
summarized
a
moment
ago?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
i'm
beating
a
dead
horse,
but
justice
breyer
made
the
point,
and
he
made
it
i
think
very
clearly,
that
although
that
evidence
was
in,
the
argument
here
--
the
argument
that
was
made
before
the
jury
in
this
case
is
that
the
witnesses
upon
whom
the
defense
was
specifically
relying
were
witnesses
whose
account
of
the
defendant's
drug
use
came
solely
from
the
defendant
himself.
given
that
fact,
wouldn't
it
have
been
mitigating
evidence
to
learn
that
other
people,
at
times
relatively
close
to
the
events
in
question,
without
being
coached
by
the
defendant,
had
concluded
that
he
was
a
drug
user?
wouldn't
that
have
been
mitigating
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
are
not
asking
about
materiality
at
this
point.
we
are
asking
about
the
mitigating
character
of
the
evidence.
would
it
have
been
favorable
to
the
defendant?
would
that
have
been
its
tendency?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
was
not
my
question.
was
it
favorable
evidence?
did
it
have
a
tendency
to
favor
the
defendant?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
will
be
candid
with
you
that
i
simply
cannot
follow
your
argument
because
i
believe
you
have
just
made
a
statement
to
me
that
is
utterly
irrational.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
--
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
that
these
various
items
of
--
of
brady
material
were
adverted
to
and
were
discussed
on
a
purely
isolated
basis;
they
were
not
discussed
in
terms
of
their
cumulative
effect,
which
kyles
v.
whitley
says
is
the
standard.
what's
your
response
to
that?
