but
it
was
--
it
was
decided.
it
was
decided
--
wasn't
it
decided
the
first
time
around?
i
mean,
what
the
--
the
chief
justice
calls
your
attention
to
page
25a.
the
reason
the
court
said
they're
not
brady
material
is
we
said
it
before;
we
said
it
the
last
time
the
case
was
before
the
court.

justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
your
--
but
your
proposal
would
be
that
they
would
never
do
it
because
you
want
to
send
it
back
to
the
federal
district
court,
and
--
and
if
the
state
was
laboring
under
misapprehension,
it
thought
that,
because
he
brought
up
the
issue
twice,
he
had
somehow
been
defaulted,
everyone
can
agree
that
that
didn't
make
sense.
but
now
you're
proposing
that
the
state
court
will
not
be
the
one
to
look
at
these
materials;
instead
it
will
be
the
federal
court.
i
think
there
was
something
that
judge
merritt
said
in
his
dissent
that
indicated
he
thought
that
the
state
court
ought
to
be
the
one
to
do
this
close
examination.
didn't
--
didn't
he
propose
a
stay
of
the
brady
claim
in
the
federal
court
pending
exhaustion
of
that
claim
in
the
state
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
was
that
colloquy?
i
remember
witnesses
saying
he
looked
weird,
he
looked
wild-eyed.
where
was
the
answer
that
he
looked
--
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
recognize
that
a
--
a
defense
like
this,
that
the
defendant
was
high
on
drugs,
that's
--
isn't
it
ambivalent?
i
mean,
a
jury,
just
like
it
might
react
adversely
to
the
defendant
if
he
says
i
was
drunk
on
alcohol,
that
they
might
say:
this
is
a
person
who
put
himself
in
the
condition
where
his
will
could
be
overpowered.
this
was
a
voluntary
act.
why
should
we
consider
it?
why
should
we
consider
it
mitigating?
we
--
we
could
just
as
well
consider
it
aggravating.
justice

but
what
about
the
prosecutor
who
said
"baloney"?
he
said
--
the
prosecutor
--
the
prosecutor
says:
the
defendant
tells
you
he
was
a
drug
user.
baloney,
he
was
a
drug
dealer.
the
prosecutor
deliberately
tried
to
paint
this
man
as
somebody
who
had
a
huge
quantity
of
drugs,
which
he
did,
and
he
was
dealing
in
them.
i
mean
the
--
the
prosecutor
tried
to
portray
a
man
who
was
a
coldblooded
killer,
who
didn't
have
any
blurred
vision.
and
that
line
to
the
jury
--
"baloney"
he
says
he
was
a
drug
user
--
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
exactly
what
the
prosecutor
wanted
to
do,
is
to
tell
this
jury
this
guy's
a
dealer;
he's
not
a
drug
abuser.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
spell
out
the
waiver
in
light
of
what
he
said.
the
first
time
he
learns
that
these
--
the
cases,
other
cases
cited
and
he
has
access
to
the
district
attorney's
file,
he
then
files
a
habeas,
state
habeas
petition
in
which
he
says
that
the
facts
on
which
his
brady
claim
rests
have
been
revealed
through
disclosure
of
the
state's
file
which
occurred
after
the
first
conviction
proceeding.
those
words
are
in
the
affidavit,
right,
that
came
with
the
second
petition?
so
how
could
he
possibly
have
waived
it
when
he
has
explained
it
wasn't
available
to
him?
