justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
blankman
--
that
isn't
the
concern.
the
concern
is
simply
this,
if
they're
correct:
that
this
whole
trial
revolves
around
whether
this
individual
is
suffering
post-traumatic
stress
disorder
with
--
with
these
amphetamines.
they
have
two
expert
witnesses
who
say
that
he's
in
very
bad
shape,
everything
the
defense
wanted
them
to
say.
that's
it.
that's
their
evidence.
on
cross,
the
prosecutor
gets
both
of
them
to
admit
that
they're
basing
their
testimony
on
what
the
defendant
told
them
about
his
drug
use.
at
which
point
the
prosecutor
says,
let's
talk
to
mr.
roby,
who
is
the
arresting
officer,
did
you
see
he
was
on
--
when
you
arrested
him,
was
he
on
--
did
he
look
like
he
was
on
drugs?
no.
let's
talk
to
mr.
flynn.
when
you
processed
him,
did
he
look
like
he
was
on
drugs?
and
then
let's
talk
to
ms.
blankman,
okay?
so,
now
the
case
is
submitted,
and
at
that
point
the
prosecutor
says,
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
was
on
drugs;
he
said
that
to
those
two
expert
witnesses,
and
it's
baloney.
there's
your
case.
now,
in
fact
in
the
files
is
evidence
that
mr.
roby,
that
very
day
of
the
crime
and
the
next
day,
sent
out
all-points
bulletins
saying
he
was
a
dangerous
drug
user.
there
is
evidence
in
the
files
that
mr.
--
that
the
fbi
man
sent
out
similar
all-point
bulletins.
there
are
three
witnesses
who
have
described
the
behavior
on
the
day
as
frenzied,
and
we
have
heard
the
descriptions.
and
you're
saying
that
the
lawyer,
the
trained
lawyer
for
the
government,
who
knew
this
information
and
knew
the
defense
just
what?
just
overlooked
it
by
accident?
just
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
also
had
cross-examined
the
two
expert
witnesses
in
order
to
show
that
they
didn't
really
know
that
this
man
was
a
drug
user,
because
their
only
basis
for
that
was
he
told
them.
so
as
i've
read
these
briefs,
i've
come
away
--
including
yours
--
with
a
strong
impression
that
this
was
a
relevant
issue,
that
the
prosecution
did
not
concede
that
he
was
on
drugs
at
the
time
of
the
murder.
indeed,
that
that
was
all
that
was
at
issue.
and
so
i
just
don't
see,
like
justice
souter,
how
you
can
say
that
this
wouldn't
at
least
be
useful
information
if
--
even
for
cross-examination,
and
i
think
more
than
that
since
you
have
three
direct
witnesses.
but
leaving
that
aside,
there's
another
part
of
this
case
that
equally
bothers
me.
it
seems
to
me
there
was
a
lawyer
for
the
state
here
that
twice
told
the
courts
that
this
matter
had
never
been
raised.
is
that
so?
or
maybe
he
said
that
the
courts
had
decided
it,
because
the
state
has
taken
absolutely
inconsistent
positions,
first
saying
that
the
trial
courts
decided
it,
and
they
did
decide
it,
but
by
accident.
they
thought
that
paragraph
41
referred
to
this
claim
when
it
referred
to
an
earlier
claim.
so
first
they
tell
the
courts
--
and
you
wouldn't
know
that
unless
you
are
pretty
familiar
because
there
were
a
lot
of
words
written.
they
tell
the
courts:
it's
been
decided,
judge.
don't
worry.
they
decided
it
--
adequate
state
ground.
then
next
they
wake
up
to
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
decided,
and
then
they
announce:
oh,
he
waived
it,
despite
the
fact
that
there's
a
case
called
swanson
in
tennessee
that
says
that
you
can
raise
a
later
claim
if
you
have
grounds
for
not
knowing
of
it
in
the
first
place.
and
he
didn't
know
of
it
until
1993.
so
i
see
the
state
taking
opposite
positions
and
--
and
what
seems
from
the
briefs
inconsistent
with
the
state
law,
and
i'm
confused.
what
is
it
that
happened
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
"waiver"
--
my
goodness.
first,
i
don't
think
it's
impossible
to
say
41
that
make
absolutely
clear
that
they
aren't
waiving
it.
he
is
raising
it.
then,
aside
from
that,
the
paragraph
of
the
district
--
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
says
they
were
already
decided
or
waived.
so
it's
ambiguous,
at
best,
for
you.
so
let's
go
back
and
see
what
the
state
district
court
held,
and
i
think
that
the
state
district
court
held
that
it
had
been
decided,
not
that
it
had
been
waived.
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
there
are
cases
in
this
court
which
say
if
a
state
appeals
court
writes
a
matter
--
something
--
a
sentence
that
is
ambiguous
so
you
don't
know
whether
it
was
decided
--
for
example,
they
mean
it
was
waived
or
mean
that
it
was
decided
--
then
the
next
best
thing
to
do,
which
makes
sense,
is
look
to
the
lower
court
to
see
what
they
actually
did.
so
we
follow
that
rule,
and
we
get
to
exactly
what
justice
alito
said:
that
what
they
did
was
they
were
holding
that
this
has
already
been
decided.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
don't
you
think
at
this
point
the
petitioner
is
saying
in
his
briefs:
i've
been
getting
the
runaround.
first,
they
tell
me
it's
one
thing;
then
they
tell
me
another.
all
i
can
tell
you
is
this:
no
one
has
ever
passed
on
the
merits
of
this
brady
claim,
which
is
a
substantial
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
choose
the
procedures,
but
be
sure
that
that's
the
outcome.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
the
explanation
of
this
language
in
the
opinion
be
due
to
the
fact
that
the
state
first
argued
that
it
had
already
been
decided;
then
in
later
courts
the
state
changed
its
theory
and
announced
that
it
had
been
waived?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
why
they're
writing
about
waiver?
