where
am
i
going
to
find
footnote
6?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
when
--
when
did
the
court
indicate
in
--
in
tennessee
that
you
had
access
to
the
file?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
that
--
oh,
i
thought
that
was
2000
--
when
was
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
1992.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
brady
claim
has
been
pending
in
the
federal
courts
but
just
not
decided
since
about
2001?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
what
--
can
you
tell
me
what
is
this
--
let's
suppose
that
you
had
an
initial
brady
claim
that
there
was
one
part
of
the
file
that
you
were
entitled
to
see
that
said
that
there
is
some
evidence
that
he's
a
drug
user.
and
you
--
and
you
take
that
brady
claim
up.
later
you
find
out
--
you
have
access
to
a
new
file
and
you
find
cumulative
information
plus
the
information
that
he
was
dazed
or
something,
which
may
not
be
very
strong.
what's
our
test
to
determine
whether
the
brady
claim
has
been
exhausted?
or
have
we
talked
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
--
do
you
think
that
the
material
described
by
justice
breyer
would
have
been
excluded
by
the
trial
court
as
irrelevant
if
it
had
been
introduced?
or
cumulative?
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
initially
brady
leaves
the
judgment
--
the
judgment,
further
on
justice
souter's
point,
to
the
attorney
for
the
defense.
you're
saying
that
the
prosecutor
can
pre-empt
the
role
of
the
attorney
for
the
defense
in
deciding
what
to
offer
to
the
court
as
material?
and
if
--
and
if
it
--
even
if
the
evidence
is
in
a
gray
area,
that's
for
--
that's
for
the
defense
attorney
to
decide
under
--
under
our
brady
jurisprudence,
as
i
understand
it.
correct
me
if
that's
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
outside
the
record
and
not
really
relevant
to
the
case.
has
he
been
on
death
row
since
1984
or
so?
and
if
so,
is
that
solitary
confinement?
do
you
know
how
large
the
cell
is,
if
you
know?
