justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stewart,
we're
reviewing
a
decision
of
the
federal
circuit.
and
the
federal
circuit
relied
dominantly
on
the
florida
power
case
in
which
the
same
issue
was
presented,
albeit
under
a
different
statute.
but
i
--
reading
that
florida
power,
where
the
federal
circuit
adopted
the
government's
position,
the
government's
position
then
was
that
this
very
same
transaction
involved
the
rendition
of
services
and
not
a
sale
of
goods.
does
the
government
have
a
distinction
between
those
two
cases,
or
are
you
now
saying
in
hindsight
you
realized
that
the
position
that
you
took
before
the
federal
circuit
in
the
early
case
was
wrong?
