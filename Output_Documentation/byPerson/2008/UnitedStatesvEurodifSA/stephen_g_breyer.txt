justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can
imagine
you
could
have
a
grain
mill
and
they
have
lots
and
lots
of
grain
absolute
identical
one
to
the
other.
and
the
farmer
takes
his
grain
up
and
they
operate
on
it,
and
then
he
drives
away
with
the
grain,
milled.
now,
it
may
make
no
difference
to
anybody
whether
the
identical
molecules
are
the
same;
and
i
think
in
such
a
case
you'd
say
they
are
processing
it;
they
are
not
buying
and
selling
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
saying
if
we
have
that,
in
fact,
if
the
--
if
the
exact
situation,
if
some
farmers
up
in
north
dakota
send
their
grain
just
to
be
milled
--
it's
their
grain
--
up
in
canada,
and
they
come
back,
and
it
--
you
know,
it
may
not
be
the
identical
molecule,
but
it's
identically
the
same;
they
have
done
this
for
100
years
--
now
suddenly
this
--
the
commerce
department
is
going
to
say,
that's
a
sale,
and
the
antidumping
statutes
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
would
it
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
you,
and
i
just
wonder,
what
i
would
like
to
know,
is
if
any
businessman
involved
in
any
of
these
or
related
things
before
this
decision
of
the
commerce
department
would
have
thought
that
that
is
how
the
commerce
department
would
have
treated
such
a
transaction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know.
i'm
asking
--
the
question
is
the
same
as
the
last
case,
to
me:
not
whether
they
could
have
done
it;
sure
they
could
have
done
it.
my
question
is
based
on
my
question
of
whether
they
had
a
rule
that
any
reasonable
person
would
have
thought
that
is
how
they
treated
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
after
all,
you
have
three
precedents
in
related
areas,
not
the
direct
area
but
in
related
areas,
that
suggest
that
they
wouldn't
have
treated
the
millers
that
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know
what,
i'm
thinking
of
those
things,
they're
something
called
"tollers".
i
don't
know
exactly
what
tollers
are.
they
seem
to
be
like
people
who
give
haircuts.
they're
sort
of
servicers
of
some
kind.
they're
talking
about
tollers
and
--
and
subcontractors.
and
that
is
a
related
area.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
--
what
do
we
do
about
the
question
that
is
bothering
me?
maybe
at
some
point
--
maybe
it's
not
a
relevant
question
--
but
i
will
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
commerce
does
have
the
power
to
classify
it
either
way.
what
is
bothering
me,
and
maybe
that's
not
in
this
case,
is
that
as
the
--
as
your
brother
lawyer
just
said,
this
statute
has
been
around
for
90
years.
there
has
been
trillions
of
dollars
worth
of
foreign
commerce
during
that
time.
yet
i
don't
find
cited
here
any
instance
in
which
commerce
ever
before
said
that
when
you
have
title
to
a
good,
and
you
send
it
abroad,
for
even
a
big
change
in
it,
and
then
it
comes
back,
that
that
is
a
sale.
now,
i
might
--
i
don't
know
all
the
commerce
cases;
maybe
they
did.
but
what
i
found
here
is
like
a
blank
on
that
side,
and
on
the
other
side
the
tolling
cases,
florida
power
&
light,
the
pizza
case,
to
the
point
where
i
thought,
if
i
was
a
lawyer
advising
a
client,
and
that
client
said
if
i
keep
title
to
the
good,
am
i
home
free,
i
would
have
to
say,
yes,
you
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
that's
the
--
the
question
i
want
responded
to
in
the
legal
context
of,
has
commerce
made
a
significant
change
in
its
policy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
read
--
at
what
page
do
i
find
all
these
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
roughly.
i'll
find
it.
i
will
find
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
will
see
a
lot
of
cases
where--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
pretty
important.
tell
me
--
this
is
a
hard
area,
obviously.
but
the
--
imagine
--
think
of
all
the
toller
cases
that
they've
had.
now
--
now,
is
this
right:
that
in
every
one
of
those
cases
there
were
two
companies,
a
and
b;
and
in
every
one
of
those
cases
a
sells
a
finished
product
into
the
united
states.
and
also
a
sends
the
product
to
b
to
have
some
major
thing
done
on
it.
in
every
one
of
those
cases
the
commerce
department
could
say:
we
can
take
a
as
a
respondent;
i.e.
we
think
a
might
violate
the
law,
because
maybe
it's
an
italian
company,
or
we
think
b
might
violate
the
law.
is
that
true
of
all
those
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
it's
true
of
all
those
cases,
then
i
think
what
the
opposite
position
is,
what
mr.
farr
said,
i
think
--
i
think,
you
know,
i
will
--
he
will
say:
look
at
page
40
and
41
of
their
brief.
when
i
look
at
those
pages,
i
am
going
to
see
a
lot
of
cases.
and
i
bet,
when
i
look
them
up,
those
commerce
cases
are
all
going
to
use
the
word
"substantial
transformation".
and
he
will
say:
you
see,
that's
what
they
did
here.
then
he's
going
to
add
--
i
don't
mean
to
put
words
in
his
mouth
if
the
words
are
wrong,
but
--
but
he's
going
to
add:
look
at
those
tolling
cases.
those
are
all
cases
where
commerce
had
a
choice
of
which
to
consider
the
sale.
it
could
have
considered
the
sale
from
the
processor
a
to
--
to
b
to
a,
the
sale
if
it
wanted
to;
or
it
could
have
considered
the
sale
into
the
united
states
if
it
had
wanted
to,
to
be
the
sale
for
purposes
of
calculating
the
price.
and
so
in
choosing
between
those
two,
either
of
which
it
could
have
chosen,
it
chose
the
latter
sale,
the
final
sale,
because
that's
how
they
could
calculate
the
price.
but
in
your
case
there
is
no
such
person
a,
because
the
utilities
are
not
people
who
could
be
respondents.
i
mean
they
are
not
in
the
same
position.
there
is
no
sale
onwards
that
they
could
choose.
so
we
will
go
to
the
other
guy,
the
party
--
the
person
who
does
the
processing.
are
you
following
what
i
am
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
is
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
but,
remember,
they
are
saying
in
the
tolling
cases,
in
my
words:
hey,
we
could
have
gone
after
the
processor
if
we
wanted--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
there
had
been
a
substantial
transformation,
because
the
key
to
this
concept
of
"sale"
is
the
word
"substantial"
transformation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
which--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
any
point
in
time
from
the
time
that
the
--
the
processors
get
ahold
of
the
uranium
until
the
time
it
leaves
their
control
that
if
they
went
bankrupt,
anyone
other
than
the
utility
could
get
ahold
of
the
product?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
okay.
