mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
provision
of
enriched
uranium
under
separative
work
unit
or
swu
contracts
is
covered
by
the
federal
antidumping
duty
law.
the
resolution
of
that
question
turns
on
whether
the
performance
of
swu
contracts
results
in
merchandise
being
sold
in
the
united
states.
the
department
of
commerce,
which
is
the
federal
agency
entrusted
by
congress
with
the
administration
of
the
antidumping
duty
law,
concluded
after
an
extensive
investigation
that
swu
contracts
do
result
in
sales
of
enriched
uranium.
that
determination
was
reasonable
and
should
be
sustained
by
this
court.
now,
the
fundamental
bargain
in
a
swu
contract
is
that
the
customer,
the
utility,
provides
a
combination
of
feedstock
or
feed
uranium
plus
cash,
and
receives
in
return
a
specified
quantity
and
assay
of
enriched
uranium,
and
by
u-235
within
the
final
product.
now,
the
customer
has
discretion
to
choose
among
varying
combinations
of
feedstock
and
cash
in
order
to
complete
the
transaction
for
a
particular
quantity
and
assay
of
enriched
uranium;
but
the
enricher
has
its
own
discretion.
that
is,
having
received
the
consideration
paid
by
the
utility,
the
enricher
is
free
to
make
its
own
determination
based
on
economic
considerations
as
to
the
relative
proportions
of
feedstocks
and
swus
that
should
be
used
to
make
a
given
quantity
of
enriched
uranium.
so
the
overall
--
the
character
of
the
overall
transaction
is
comfortably
characterized
as
a
sale,
because
it
involves
the
acquisition
by
the
utility
of
a
product,
merchandise,
that
it
didn't
own
at
the
outset
of
the
transaction
in
exchange
for
consideration.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
indeed,
as
we've
explained
in
our
opening
brief,
at
common
law
the
distinction
between
a
bailment
and
a
sale
in
that
type
of
circumstance
depended
upon
whether
the
miller
or
the
equivalent
processor
was
under
an
obligation
to
return
the
very
same
thing
in
processed
form.
and
if
that
was--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
are
saying
that
commerce
could
treat
it
as
a
sale.
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
commerce
in
that
hypothetical
--
again,
if
we
were
talking
about
grain
being
provided
by
the
customer
to
a
miller
overseas
--
overseas,
and
then
the
finished
product
being
brought
back
into
this
country,
i
think
the
logic
of
the
commerce
determination
here
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
a
sale.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
don't
think
that
commerce
had
before
this
incident
dealt
with
exactly
this
type
of
situation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
common
law
would
have
treated
it--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
certainly
suggests
that
commerce
could
permissibly
treat
it
as
a
sale.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i'm
not
sure
exactly
which
precedents
you
mean.
if
--
the
one
that
is
--
the
administrative
determination
that
is
cited
most
frequently
is
srams
from
taiwan,
in
which
the
design
house
provided,
i
believe
it
was
a
design
mask
to
the
foundry,
and
the
foundry
manufactured
the
finished
equipment
and
in
concluding
that
it
was
the
design
house
rather
than
the
foundry
that
was
properly
treated
as
the
producer
of
the
goods,
the
commerce
department
relied
in
part
on
the
fact
that
the
design
house
had
intellectual
property
rights
in
the
design
mask.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
and
the
srams
cases
is
one
of
the
toller
or
subcontractor
cases.
and
the
department
of
commerce
relied
in
part
on
the
fact
that
the
design
house
had
intellectual
property
rights
in
the
design
mask.
so
it
was
not
fungible
property,
it
was
not
an
input
that
the
foundry
could
have
gotten
from
another
source.
the
other
thing
we
would
say
about
the
grain
hypothetical
is
that
when
you
hear
about
the
farmer
providing
grain
to
the
miller
or
the
utilities
providing
feedstock
to
the
enrichers,
it
may
conjure
up
images
of
a
tangible
good
that
is
in
the
physical
possession
of
the
farmer
or
the
utility
that
is
then
physically
transferred
to
the
enricher.
in
the
case
of
the
miller
that
is
correct.
but
the
way
that
a
utility
provides
feedstock
to
an
enricher
is
not
by
taking
physical
possession
of
the
feedstock
and
then
by
transporting
it.
rather,
the
utility
simply
makes
financial
arrangements
with
the
supplier
of
feedstock,
basically
cuts
a
check
or
transfers
funds--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
that
commerce's
determination
suggests,
without
squarely
holding,
that
it
would
treat
that
as
a
sale
of
goods
because
it
would
involve
substantial
transformation
of
the
original
item.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
do.
and
i
think
it's
important,
to
carry
on
with
the
thought
i
was
sketching
out
previously
about
the
way
in
which
the
raw
materials
are
provided
to
the
enricher.
if
you
imagine
my
buying
a
suit
from
a
tailor,
and
the
tailor
says:
the
price
is
$600;
$300
of
that
accounts
for
the
cost
of
the
cloth;
$300
is
the
labor
that's
involved
in
sewing
it
into
a
suit.
clearly,
that's
a
sale
of
merchandise,
even
though
the
price
has
been
broken
up--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
alterations
would
just
be
a
finishing
process
and
that
wouldn't
involve
substantial--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
about
the
suit,
and
it
applies
equally
to
the
uranium
enrichment
process,
is
if
i
say
to
my
tailor,
rather
than
i
pay
you
$600
and
you
pay
your
cloth
supplier
$300,
how
about
i
just
give
you
$300
and
i
will
give
$300
to
your
cloth
supplier,
and
it
will
amount
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end,
because
you
won't
have
to
pay
for
the
cloth?
if
the
tailor
accepts
that
arrangement,
the
economic
substance
is
exactly
the
same.
and
it
would
seem
strange
to
say
that
it's
a
sale
if
i
just
pay
$600
to
the
tailor,
but
it's
not
a
sale
if
i
break
down
the
cost
in
the
way
that
i've
described.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that
the
commerce
determination
--
that
commerce
did
not
purport
to
either
promulgate
a
regulation
or
announce
a
test
that
precisely
defined
the
term
"sale".
i
think
the
thrust
of
the
commerce
department's
determination
was
that
substantial
transformation
was
enough,
but
that
the
case
was
much
easier
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
producer
--
the
enricher
dealt
with
fungible
goods
and
also
had
substantial
discretion
to
decide
how
much
of
the
feedstock
would
be
used
vis-a-vis--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct,
although
it
would
certainly
be
appropriate
for
this
court
if
it
didn't
want
to
address
the
situation
in
which
only
substantial
transformation
was
present,
to
say
that
at
least
when
both
circumstances
were
present
there
was
a
sale.
and
again,
to
distinguish
this
somewhat
from
the
miller
hypothetical,
the
miller
in
making
grain
into
flour
may
have
discretion
as
to
which
individual
grains
to
use
for
a
particular
batch
of
flour,
but
it
won't
typically
have
discretion
as
to
what
weight
of
grain
will
be
used
to
make
what
weight
of
flour.
and
the
enricher
has
that
discretion
as
well;
that
is,
to
produce
a
particular
quantity
and
assay
of
enriched
uranium,
the
enricher
can
either
use
more
feedstock
and
fewer
swu's--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--a
swu
is
a
unit
of
work
and
it's
work
in
the
sense
of
output;
that
is,
it
is
the
work
necessary
to
separate
out
a
particular
quantity
of
enriched
uranium--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
right.
the
amount
of
--
the
separation
process
or
the
enrichment
process
involves
a
separation
of
the
original
feedstock
into
the
enriched
uranium
and
what
is
referred
to
as
the
tails,
which
is
the
residue
or
the
depleted
uranium.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'm
not
sure
whether
commerce
would
treat
that
as
substantial
transformation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
now,
in
this
case
--
in
this
particular
case,
commerce
noted
that
there
was
no
dispute
among
the
parties
that
the
enrichment
process
did
result
in
substantial
transformation.
so
that
--
that
uncertainly
is
not
present
here.
but
i
agree
that
there
is
a
gray
area
with
respect
to
substantial
transformation
that
isn't
present
when
you
are
trying
to
answer
the
question:
is
the
customer
getting
back
the
same
thing
in
modified
form
or
is
he
getting
back
a
different
thing?
that
is,
although
the
contracts
between
the
utility
and
the
enricher
deem
the
enriched
uranium
to
have
been
produced
with
the
customer's
own
feedstock,
everybody
acknowledges
that
that
is
not
the
fact
in
the
real
world.
and
so,
what
the
customer
receives
back
is
not
like
your
diamond
hypothetical,
in
which
he
receives
an
improved
version
of
the
original
product.
it
is
as
though
you
had
a
diamond
company
that
said,
we
need
inventory
all
the
time,
and
we're
prepared
to
work
out
an
arrangement
where
if
you
send
us
a
raw
diamond
plus
cash,
we
will
send
you
back
a
different
cut
diamond.
that
would
be
a
sale,
regardless
of
whether
there
was
substantial
transformation,
because
you
would
have
payment
of
consideration
for
a
product
that
you
indisputably
didn't
own
at
the
outset.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
think
we
have
disavowed
the
position
we
took
in
the
florida
power
&
light
case.
now,
in
all
candor,
i
would
have
to
say
the
question
of
the
contract
disputes
--
disputes
act's
applicability
to
swu
contracts
is
of
a
lot
less
interest
to
the
federal
government
now
than
it
was
then,
because
the
reason
that
arose
in
a
case
involving
the
federal
government
was
that
at
that
time
usec
was
a
government
instrumentality
and
we
were
representing
usec
in
its
governmental
incarnation.
now
that
usec
has
been
privatized,
the
federal
circuit
is
unlikely
to
confront
the
question
whether
the
contract
disputes
act
applies
to
this
sort
of
arrangements,
because
these
are
not
--
this
is
not
a
federal
entity,
in
any
event.
the
reason
that
we
think
the
two
cases
are
reconcilable
is
that
the
contract
disputes
act,
as
its
name
implies,
is
a
statute
that
governs
the
resolution
of
disputes
between
contracting
parties.
and
in
that
situation,
it's
much
more
appropriate
to
look
to
the
form
of
the
parties'
arrangement.
and
the
court
--
the
federal
circuit
in
florida
power
and
light
placed
a
lot
of
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
the
contract
was
styled
as
one
for
enrichment
services.
and
that
is
an
appropriate
consideration
to
take
into
account
when
you
are
resolving
disputes
between
the
contracting
parties,
but
when
the
whole
purpose
of
the
antidumping
statute
is
to
prevent
contracting
parties
from
entering
into
arrangements
that
are
mutually
beneficial
to
themselves,
but
that
would
and
unfairly
disadvantage
domestic
competitors,
it
was
appropriate
for
commerce
to
look
behind
the
form
of
the
contract
and
to
look
at
physical
and
economic
reality.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
it
is
true
that
the
antidumping
statute
requires
that
merchandise
be
sold
in
the
united
states,
and
we
don't
contend
that
the
statute
applies
to
price
discrimination
in
services
like
insurance
or
banking.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
is
ambiguous
at
the
margins;
that
is,
the
classic
arrangement,
the
classic
sale
is
an
exchange
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes,
and
i
think
this
is
a
statute
that
has
been
around
for,
i
believe,
close
to
90
years
now;
and
in
order
for
it
to
remain
efficacious
in
this
area,
commerce
has
to
be
able
to
adapt
its
principles
to
new
forms
of
transactions.
again,
that
doesn't
mean
that
commerce's
discretion
is
limitless,
but
it
has
some
discretion
at
the
margins.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
thank
you.
one
of
the
things
ms.
halligan
said,
and
i
think
it's
really
a
central
theme
of
their
brief,
is
that
utilities
come
to
the
enricher
for
services
and
not
for
goods.
and
to
understand
what
it
is
that
utilities
acquire,
i
think
it
may
be
helpful
to
ask:
under
what
circumstances
would
the
utility
have
a
valid
breach-ofcontract
right?
and
it
is
very
clear
that
the
enricher's
obligation
under
the
contract
is
to
deliver
a
specified
quantity
and
assay
of
enriched
uranium
at
a
specified
time
and
place.
and
if
the
enricher
complies
with
that
obligation,
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
enricher
decided
to
--
what
they
call
in
the
industry
--
swu's
to
produce
the
final
product.
and
the
utility
in
that
circumstance
couldn't
file
a
breach-of-contract
claim
by
saying:
i
paid
for
more
swu's
than
i
actually
received.
because
what
the
utility
had
contracted
for
was
a
given
product.
the
second
thing
--
and
i
think
the
corollary
to
that
is
--
it's
potentially
misleading
to
say
that
every
contract
is
either
one
for
merchandise
or
one
for
services,
especially
when
you
are
contracting
to
acquire
ownership
of
a
commodity
that
doesn't
exist
at
the
time
the
contract
is
formed.
the
only
way
you
are
going
to
get
to
your
ultimate
objective
is
for
somebody
to
create
it.
and
that
can
generally
be
described
as
a
service,
but
it
still
results
in
the
sale
of
goods.
with
respect
to
the
used-car
analogy,
i
understood
ms.
halligan
to
acknowledge
that
--
that
that
would
be
a
sale
even
though
the
consideration
paid
by
the
customer
is
partly
in
cash
and
partly
in
kind.
and
if
the
customer
and
the
car
dealership
characterize
their
contract
as
one
for
car-refurbishment
services
and
said
that
the
new
car
the
customer
receives
shall
be
deemed
to
be
the
used
car
that
it
traded
in
in
refurbished
form,
nobody
would
contend
that
that
deeming
quality
should
be
controlling.
now
here
the
--
the
falseness
of
the
proposition
that
it's
the
same
feedstock
is
less
apparent,
but
it's
equally
the
case
that
the
utility
doesn't
receive
back
its
original
feedstock.
and
finally
the
perspective
of
tolling
regulation
in
cases,
commerce
has
essentially
said
three
things:
first,
we
were
dealing
with
a
separate
question;
that
is,
who
is
the
producer,
which
sale
is
relevant,
and
not
whether
the
goods
are
covered
at
all.
second,
they
said
in
those
situations
the
tollee
was
exercising
much
more
control
over
the
ultimate
process
than
is
the
case
here
where
the
utilities
don't
manufacture
anything.
they
simply
pay
for
one
of
the
inputs.
and,
finally,
commerce
said
that
if
at
some
level
of
abstraction
there
is
a
tension
or
contradiction
between
what
we
said
previously
and
what
we
decide
today,
then
what
we
decide
today
controls.
and
commerce
is
entitled
to
make
that
determination.
