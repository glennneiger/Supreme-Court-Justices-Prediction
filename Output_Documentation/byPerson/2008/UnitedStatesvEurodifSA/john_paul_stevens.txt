mr.
stewart,
can
i
ask
a
question
about
the
scope
of
discretion
involved
here?
assume
the
facts
were
not
exactly
as
they
are
here,
it
is
not
a
fungible
product,
but
that
each
shipment
was
separately
identified
and
each
shipment
was
processed
as
a
different
batch
in
france
and
then
sent
back.
that
i
assume
would
not
normally
be
treated
as
a
sale
of
goods?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
really
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you.
even
if
the
facts
were
more
extreme,
just
as
in
the
example
i
gave,
do
you
think
the
commerce
department
would
have
discretion
to
treat
that
as
a
sale
of
goods?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
supposing
they
send
the
suit
back
to
a
different
person
for
alterations,
and
they
say,
well,
this
is
part
of
the
sale,
so
we
want
to
treat
it
as
a
sale
of
goods?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
what
we've
got
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
correct
that
the
universe
of
transactions
that
is
the
subject
of
this
act
is
sales?
is
that
not
right?
rather
than
service
contracts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
--
do
you
contend
the
word
"sold"
is
an
ambiguous
term,
requires
construction
by
a
particular
agency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
congress
intended
the
ambiguity
to
be
resolved
by
an
agency
rather
than
judges
applying
the
rules
of
common
law
and
the
rules
of
sales
law
generally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
farr,
are
there
earlier
cases
that
applied
chevron
deference
to
the
commerce's
determination
of
what
a
sale
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
you
do
that
if
you
thought
it
was
clear
as
a
matter
of
common
law
or
under
the
uniform
sales
act,
or
something
like
that,
that
it
was
not
a
sale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
common
law,
you
don't
need
deference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sorry.
if
it
were
clearly
a
sale
under
common
law,
you
wouldn't
need
to
rely
on
deference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
true
that
in
all
of
those
cases
there
is
no
transfer
of
ownership
of
the
basic
product?
and
here
--
and
i
am
not
sure
you
have
really
addressed
it
--
it
is
a
fungible
product,
and
you
are
assuming
you
can't
tell
whether
--
when
it
is
in
process
or
whether
it
is
one
party's
or
the
other's.
but
if
you
could
tell
and
you
had
some
way
of
identifying
just
which
one
here,
but
they
wouldn't
care
because
they
are
all
equally
valuable,
and
if
it
developed
that
it
was
actually
a
third
party's
product
that
was
being
processed,
then
there
would
be
a
transfer
of
ownership,
and
there
clearly
would
be
a
sale.
isn't
that
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
have
the
same
contract
you've
got
here,
but
you
are
able
to
identify
that,
in
fact,
there
is
a
difference
in
the
--
in
the
commodity
that
--
that
--
at
least
not
a
different
raw
material
that
was
sent
to
france
and
returned.
it
is
just
a
substitute.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
in
that
context,
within
the
meaning
of
your
argument,
that
there
would
have
been
the
transfer
of
title
to
that
--
that
commodity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
it
true,
if
you
can't
tell,
the
odds
are
that
there
is
some
product
the
title
to
which
has
been
transferred?
