well,
but
common
law
would
have
treated
it
that
way,
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
pretty
good
authority.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
a
swu?
you
lost
me
on
the
swu.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
put
in
more
time
with
the
uranium,
with
the
same
amount
of
235,
if
you
put
in
more
time
you
can
get
out
more?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
those
have
been
cases
where
the
very
same
product
is
returned
with
value
added,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
old
mills
used
to
do
that.
the
farmer
used
to
take
his
harvest
to
the
mill,
and
it
would
be
ground
right
there
while
he
was
waiting.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
absolutely
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
brief
constantly
assumes
that
there
has
been
no
sale,
that
throughout
the
entire
transaction,
the
utility
owned
what
ultimately
becomes
the
rods,
as
though
it
was
indeed
the
same
feedstock
that
produced
the
rod
that
was
ultimately
delivered.
and
that
is
simply
not
true.
there
is
a
change
--
there
is
a
change
of
ownership.
the
feedstock
that
somebody
else
put
into
the
mix
is
now
transferred
to
the
--
to
the
electric
utility.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
exactly
right.
you
don't
know.
so,
you
had
cannot
say
that
there
has
been
no
transfer
of
ownership.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
we've
got
the
same
molecules.
i
mean,
when
you
are
talking
about
whether
there
has
been
a
transfer
of
ownership
or
a
transfer
of
title,
you
are
talking
about
molecules;
you
are
not
talking
about
whether
you
ended
up
the
same
in,
you
know,
in
monetary
terms.
you
are
talk
about
whether
you
have
the
same
thing
that
you
delivered
to
the
person
overseas.
and
you
don't,
or
at
least
you
can't
say
that
you
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
makes
no
sense,
what
you
just
said.
that
contract
makes
no
sense.
they
hold
title
to
it
until
they
get
the
uranium
rods,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
most
of
it
is
back
overseas.
it's
still
mixed
with
the
other
fungible
u

justice

scalia
--ms.
halligan,
try
this
hypothetical,
and
it
really
gives
you
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
let's
assume
a
department
store
buys
raw
wool
from
some
sheep
herder,
sends
it
overseas.
and
it's
worth
$1,000,
this
raw
wool.
it
is
processed,
spun
and
knitted
into
sweaters,
and
then
shipped
back
to
the
department
store.
the
sweaters,
all
made
from
the
same
wool,
not
even
fungible,
so
that's
why
this
is
even
better
than
your
example
--
the
sweaters
when
they
come
back,
are
worth
not
$1,000,
but
$20,000.
do
you
think
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
the
commerce
department
to
treat
that
as
a
sale
of
sweaters
by
the
european
knitting
wool
or
--
or
home
knitters
who
did
the
sweaters?
justice
antonin
scalia
say
it
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
the
--
i'm
talking
about
the
sale
from
the
european
mills
to
the
american
department
store.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
processing
transaction.
it
has
changed
a
value
of
$1,000
into
a
value
of
--
what
did
i
say
--
$20,000?
and
that's
just
processing?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
said
there
was
no
sale.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
the
pasta
was
imported,
there
was
no
sale
into
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
get
back
to
your
pasta
case.
was
the
holding
of
that
case
that
there
was
no
sale
into
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
issue.
we
are
not
talking
here
about
which
transaction
establishes
the
price.
we
are
talking
simply
about
whether
there
was
a
sale
into
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
wait.
suppose
these
knitting
mills
in
my
example,
in
fact,
are
selling
their
sweaters
for
a
much
higher
price
in
europe.
instead
of
$20,000
for
this
batch
of
wool,
in
europe
they
are
selling
it
for
$40,000.
and
they
nonetheless
sell
the
wool
back
into
the
united
states
for
only
$20,000.
you
are
telling
me
that
that
transaction
doesn't
--
doesn't
count
for
purposes
of
our
antidumping
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
price
at
which
the
department
store
then
sells
to
individuals?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
department
store
is
not
dumping.
it's
--
it's
the
knitting
mills
that
are
dumping.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
and
accepting
that,
you
--
you
have
to
begin
the
whole
thing,
however,
with
a
sale,
with
a
sale
into
the
united
states,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
thought
this
is
--
this
is
what
you
say
fails
in
this
case.
that
is
the
link
of
the
chain
that
doesn't
exist.
you
say
there
is
no
sale
in
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
--
what
does
the
government
do
with
respect
to
these
other
transactions
where,
indeed,
the
utility
does
not
provide
the
feed
uranium
but
just
pays
for,
you
know,
getting
--
getting
the
rods?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
down
--
you
know,
there
is
no
domestic
sale
there,
either.
is
it
conceivable
that
there,
therefore,
can
be
no
dumping
in
such
a
case?
