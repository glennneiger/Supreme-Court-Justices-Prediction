ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
with
justice
breyer's
question
about
the
way
in
which
the
department
of
commerce
has
treated
transactions
for
the
processing
of
goods
and
the
uncertainty
that
their
position
in
this
case
will
cause,
not
just
in
this
industry
but
across
industries.
as
you
suggested,
justice
breyer
--
you
referred
to
--
the
department
of
commerce
has
treated
processors
who
are
called
"tollers",
in
the
language
that
commerce
uses,
as
performing
a
service.
and
the
transaction
for
the
sale
of
that
service
has
not
been
treated
as
a
cognizable
sale
under
the
antidumping
law.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
not
necessarily.
sometimes
that
is
the
case,
your
honor,
but
not
always.
for
example,
in
the
taiwan
semiconductors
case,
which
mr.
stewart
referred
to
and
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
what
the
u.s.
company
provided
was
simply
a
design
to
for
a
chip.
the
taiwanese
company,
which
was
the
processor
in
the
case
according
to
the
department
of
commerce,
manufactured
the
chip,
provided
the
silica,
used
the
design
of
the
u.s.
company,
but
no
raw
materials
at
all.
the
department
of
commerce,
in
its
explanation
as
to
why
it
treated
the
sale
for
purposes
of
the
antidumping
law
as
the
eventual
sale
by
the
u.s.
company
and
did
not
and
could
not
treat
the
sale
by
the
processor
as
a
cognizable
sale,
explained
that
the
statute
itself
requires
commerce
to
compare
the
u.s.
price,
which
is
called
the
export
price,
the
price
at
which
a
good
is
sold
or
imported
into
the
united
states,
with
the
price
at
which
the
product
is
sold
in
the
company's
home
market.
and
because
a
processor
does
not
and
cannot
either
provide
all
the
essential
components
of
the
product,
because
it's
only
providing
the
processing
service
and
not
the
raw
materials,
and
because
it
does
not
and
cannot
set
the
price
at
which
the
product
is
sold
in
the
united
states,
it
is
therefore
not
the
appropriate
sale
to
look
at
that
in
terms
of
the
antidumping
statute.
that's--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--first
of
all,
the
department
of
commerce
has
not
until
this
case
suggested
that
fungibility
of
goods
might
make
some
sort
of
a
difference.
in
fact,
in
one
of
the
cases
that
we
cite
regarding
flanges
which
were,
according
to
the
department
of
commerce,
fungible,
they
concluded
that
the
processing
service
there
was
not
the
cognizable
sale,
the
downstream
sale
of
that
product
was.
but
more
importantly
it
doesn't
change
the
substance
of
the
deal
between
the
two
parties.
what
the
utilities
come
to
the
table
with
is
cash,
and
they
provide
the
feed.
it
is
fungible
as
a
matter
of
its
physical
properties.
it
is
a
gas.
and
when
the
feed
is
put
into
the
gaseous
diffusion
chamber,
which
is
the
very
large
installation
that
the
enricher
uses
to
concentrate
the
two
different
molecular
isotopes,
it
takes
a
month
for
the
gas
to
work
its
way
through
this
plant.
the
enricher
cannot
feasibly
segregate
different
lots
of
feed,
just
like
you
can't
with
a
grain
elevator.
the
analogy
would
be,
with
respect
to
a
grain
elevator,
you
would
have
to
run
in
one
farmer's
bag
of
feed,
run
it
all
the
way
through
the
elevator
and
through
the
mill,
and
wait
until
the
product
comes
out
at
the
end,
and
then
run
another
farmer's
bag
of
feed
through.
that's
economically
impractical
and--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--but
--
but
there
is
nothing
about
the
economic
transaction
that
requires
that
it--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--that
happen,
and
more
importantly,
the
enrichers
don't
end
up
at
the
end
of
the
day
with
any
feed.
they
are
also--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--it
may
be
the
same
molecules;
it
may
not
be.
there
is
no
way
to
know
or
to
tell.
and
there
is--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--respectfully,
your
honor,
i
disagree.
if
you
look
at
the
contracts,
and
the
substance
squares
with
the
contracts
because,
at
the
end
of
this
transaction,
what
the
enricher
walks
away
with
is
cash
and
what
the
utilities
walk
away
with
are
the
same
number
of
uranium
molecules
that
they
came
to
that
plant
with.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
you
can't
say
for
sure
because
the
gas
molecules
can't
be
segregated
that
way.
i
think
that
you
need
to
look
at
two
things:
i
think
that
you
need
to
look
at
what
each
of
the
parties
to
the
transaction
come
to
the
table
with
and
what
they
walk
away
with.
and
with
respect
to
the
utilities,
they
come
to
the
table
with
uranium.
it's
a
very
expensive
commodity.
the
contracts
are
clear
that
they
hold
title
to
it
through
the
process
until
such
time
as
they
take
possession
of
the
concentrated
uranium.
it
is
clear
from
the
contracts
that
there
is
an
intent
to
maintain
a
continuous
stream
of
ownership.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
no,
they
hold
title
to
it
until
--
just
to
provide
a--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--your
honor,
the
contracts
provide
several
things.
first
of
all,
they
provide
that
the
utilities
will
deliver
their
feed
within
a
certain
number
of
days
prior
to
the
date
on
which
they
will
have
the
concentrated
uranium
product
provided
to
them.
it's
60
to
90
days,
depending
on
the
contract.
so,
pursuant
to
the
contract,
they
deliver
the
uranium
feed.
the
utilities
run
it
through
their
system.
and
at
the
end
of
that
diffusion
process,
they
take
the
concentrated
isotopes
out
and
they
provide
that
to
the
utility.
the
enrichers
don't
receive
any
amount
of
feed
that
they
can
then
take
on
to
the
open
market.
by
distinction,
if
you
look
at
a
used
car
sale,
for
example,
which
is
an
analogy
the
government
uses.
if
i
want
to
trade
my
car
in,
i
come
to
the
dealer
and
i
bring
with
me
two
pieces
of
consideration.
i
bring
the
used
car,
which
is
payment
in
time
and
i
bring
cash.
i
walk
away
with
my
wallet
a
little
bit
lighter
and
a
new
car,
and
the
used
car
dealer
has
cash,
but
also
has
an
item
that
he
can
then
go
out
onto
the
market
and
sell.
that
does
not
occur
here.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
the
price
terms
of
the
contract
provide
only
for
the
utilities
to
pay
for
the
amount
of
energy
that
is
expended.
i
would
distinguish
this
from
another
kind
of
contract
per
uranium
feed,
which
we
don't
contest
is
covered
by
the
antidumping
laws.
there
is
a
very
small
percentage
of
concentrated
uranium,
of
low
enriched
uranium
that
is
sold
pursuant
to
what
the
parties
call
an
enriched
uranium
product
contract,
an
edp
contract.
that
sort
of
a
contract
is
one
in
which
the
enricher
goes
out
into
the
market
procures
feed
and
performs
a
processing
service.
the
utility
comes
to
the
enricher,
pays
them
cash
and
walks
away
with
the
product.
by
comparison,
in
these
contracts,
the
utilities
are
providing
something
that
is
very
valuable.
the
feed
company--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--those
are
very
different
kinds
of
contracts,
though,
your
honor.
the
contract
in
which
the
enricher
simply
provides
some
amount
of
enriched
uranium
for
a
price
and
procures
the
feed,
which
is
a
sliver
of
the
total
contracts
--
it's
5
percent
even
for
usec
--
is
one
in
which
the
enricher
is
bearing
the
cost
of
the
feed
and
the
risk
of
those
price
fluctuations.
the
reasons
that
the
contracts
are
predominantly,
almost
exclusively
structured
as
services
contracts
by
distinction
is
that
the
utilities
choose
to
manage
the
process
of
procuring
fuel
themselves.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
that's
right.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
and
so,
they
go
out
into
the
market
and
procure
the
feed
pursuant
to
whatever
arrangements
they
have
with
their
feed
suppliers.
by
comparison,
all
they
are
coming
to
the
enricher
for
is
the
service
of
concentrating
that
positional
isotope
into
the
assay--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--they
are.
but
they
are
choosing
to
pay
two
completely
different
entities
in
two
unrelated
and
two
unlinked
transactions.
so,
it
doesn't
--
we
are
not
disagreeing
that
there
is
a
transaction
for
feed
that
the
uranium
--
that
the
utilities
engage
in
to
procure
their
feed.
there
has
to
be.
but
that
is
not
part
of
the
distinct
services
contracts
for
processing
only,
which
is
all
that
the
department
of
commerce
is
looking
to
shoehorn
into
this
statute
here.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
it
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
department
of
commerce
to
do
what
it
has
done
in
the
past,
which
is
to
treat
the
sale
of
the
sweater
by
the
u.s.
companies
for
$20,000
as
the
cognizable
sale.
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
case--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--in
your
hypothetical--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--that
would
be
a
processing
transaction.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
what
the
department
of
commerce
has
looked
at.
they
--
they
looked
at
the
processing
of
pasta.
and
the
--
there
the
manufacturer
came
to
a
company
--
this
is
a
place
called
certain
pasta
from
italy
--
it's
referenced
in
the
brief
--
the
company
came
to
the
processor
with
wheat
and
presumably
whatever
other
products
went
into
the
pasta,
some
milk
or
eggs.
the
pasta
was
processed
and
made
into
pasta
from
the
wheat
and
given
back
to
the
u.s.
company.
the
department
of
commerce
concluded
that
the
appropriate
sales
target
was
not
the
making
of
the
pasta,
the
processing
of
the
pasta,
but
the
downstream
sale
of
the
pasta
in
the
united
states.
and
that
is
what
the
statute
requires.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
they
said
that--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--no,
they
said
that--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--we
don't
disagree,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
product
that
comes
into
the
united
states,
it's
low
enriched
uranium.
but
the
statute
doesn't
target
the
importation
of
products.
and
in
that
way
it
is
distinct
from
the
companion
statute,
the
countervailing
duty
statute.
what
this
statute,
the
antidumping
statute,
covers
is
the
sale
of
merchandise
into
the
united
states.
that
means
that
you
have
to
have
merchandise
as
distinct
from
services,
but
by
comparison
to
countervailing
duty
statute
covers
both,
which
is
part
of
how
we
know
that
congress
means
that
distinction
tolls.
and
you
have
to--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--the
question
before
commerce
was
which
transaction
is
the
appropriate
transaction
for
us
to
treat
as
--
as
the
one
that
establishes
the
price
all
over
the
united
states.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
it
turns
on
the
same
issue,
your
honor,
and
here's
why.
in
all
of
these
processing
cases
that
the
department
of
commerce
has
looked
at,
they
have
explained
that
the
reason
why
the
cognizable
sale
is
the
sale
of
the
finished
product
in
the
united
states,
the
pasta,
the
sweater,
or
whatever
it
may
be,
is
because
the
statute
gets
at
price
discrimination.
and
it
instructs
the
department
to
look
at
the
price
at
which
the
product
is
sold
in
the
united
states.
the
price
for
the
weaving
of
the
sweaters,
even
if
it
does
add
the
sort
of
value
that
you
are
talking
about,
is
not
the
price
at
which
the
product
is
sold,
nor
does
it
reflect
all
of
the
components
of
the
transaction,
because
there
is
some
components
that
the
wool
request.
so
to
determine
whether
there
is
price
discrimination,
you
have
to
look
apples
to
apples
at
which
the
product
is
sold
in
the
united
states.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
to
the
extent
that
it
may--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--that's
right.
because
that's
what
the
statute
is
intended
to
capture.
the
statute
was
enacted--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--but
the
question,
your
honor,
is
--
is
the
price
at
which
the
product
is
sold
in
the
united
states.
section
1677(a)
defines
"export
price"
and
"constructed
export
price"
as
the
price
at
which
the
subject
merchandise
is
first
sold
in
the
united
states.
and
that
is
what
you
have
to
look
at.
it
may
certainly
be
true
that
you
may
be
able
to
sell
a
product
at
less
than
its
fair
value
to
the
extent
that
you
are
obtaining
processing
services
at
a
price
lower
than
what
you
could
obtain
them
in
a
foreign
country.
but
the
--
the
bottom
line
is
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
statute
explicitly
instructs,
at
the
price
at
which
the
subject
merchandise
is
sold
in
the
united
states.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
a
sale
and
i--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--there
is
an
importation
of
leu
into
the
united
states
by
the
utilities.
the
utilities
consume
that
fuel
in
their
reactors.
they
do
not
sell
it
onward
as
the
company
would
sell
a
sweater
or
would
sell
a
pasta
or
would
sell
rya
rugs.
that
is
something
that
makes
this
case
somewhat
different
and--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--it
is
true.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
yes.
and
then
it
starts
an
invidious--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--and
here
is
why
that's
not
sufficient.
it's
the
problem
of
the
tail
wagging
the
dog,
right?
what
the
united
states
is
saying
is
that
because
in
this
single
circumstance
we
do
not
have
a
downstream
sale
of
pasta,
or
a
sweater,
or
whatever
the
item
might
be,
and
we
can't
go
after
that
transaction,
that,
therefore,
we
are
asking
this
court
to
sign
off
on
essentially
rewriting
the
statute.
the
statute
refers
to
a
sale
of
merchandise.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
but
that's--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--two
responses,
your
honor:
first
of
all,
the
statute
doesn't
allow
that,
and
i
would
recommend
to
the
court
the
remand
response
that
commerce
provided
in
the
taiwan
semiconductor
case.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
the
taiwan
semiconductor
case
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
it
explains
why
the
definition
of
"export
price"
and
"constructed
export
price"
means
you
can't
go
after
a
processing
transaction.
secondly,
in
order
to
find
for
the
government
here
and
reverse
the
federal
circuit,
you
would
effectively
have
to
agree
with
the
government's
position
that
processing
services
where
they
are
part
of
the
manufacturing
operation
somehow
are
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
and
so
that
would
mean
that
the
government
can
say
in
this
case
that
because
there's
no
downstream
sale
that
it
can
capture,
it
will
choose
to
go
after
the
processing
transaction.
but
there
is
no
way
to
gauge
down
the
road
whether
it
will
make
the
same
choice.
and
here--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--in
those
cases--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--no.
those
cases
--
we
--
we
do
not
disagree
--
are
a
sale
of
merchandise
because
the
utility
is
paying
for
the
entire
commodity.
what
--
that
is
a
substantial
transformation
point,
justice
breyer.
i
would
like
to
--
to
return
to
that.
there
are
many
processing
transactions
which
involve
some
kind
of
substantial
transformation
where
you
have
a
product
like
wheat
and
you
turn
it
into
something
else
like
pasta,
or
wool
and
you
turn
it
into--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--i
think
not,
your
honor,
certainly
not
for
the
same
reasons
that
you
would
have
that
in
--
in
a
grain
elevator.
if
the
enricher
goes
out
and
purchases
the
feed
and
holds
title
to
that
feed
while
it
is
enriching
it,
then,
yes,
there
would
be
a
transfer
of
ownership.
ms.
caitlin
j.

first
of
all,
you
can't
tell
--
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
--
any
dispute
as
to
that
fact.
but,
secondly,
if
you
look
at
the
common
law
of--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--no,
i
--
i
think
you
certainly
can't
tell
what
molecules
come
out
the
other
end.
i
think--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--yes.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
and
that's
--
that's
the
operative
premise
that
i
am
disagreeing
with,
with
all
due
respect.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
i
mean
the
legal
--
the
legal
consequences
is
--
is
what
i
am--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--the
utility
holds
title
to
a
discreet
amount
of
feed
uranium.
it's
in
--
i--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--no,
not
at
all.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
because--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--it
--
maybe
the
useful
analogy
is
money
--
is
money
in
the
bank,
your
honor.
if
i
take
$100
and
i
bring
it
to
the
bank,
ten
10's,
and
i
take
away
five
20's,
i
may
not
have
the
same
dollar
bills
that
i
brought
to
the
bank,
but
i
don't
think
anyone
would
argue
that,
somehow,
the
bank
takes
title
to
my
money.
i
retain
ownership
of
that,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
contract
which
suggests
that
there
is
any
change
of
ownership
that
is--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--but
the
bank
could
not
hold
title
to
that
as
against
me
if
i
came
and
tried
to
take
the
money
out
of
my
safe
deposit
box,
nor
could
the
farmers
at
the
--
at
the
grain
elevator
be
told
that
they
--
they
don't
have
title
to
the
grain.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
no.
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
and
let
me
clarify
this
because
it's
an
important
issue.
these
are
very
expensive,
offshore
transactions
that
the
utilities
engage
in
in
order
to
purchase
a
feed.
it
is
a
very
valuable
commodity.
so
what
is
critical
to
the--
ms.
caitlin
j.
halligan
--but
--
but
the
system
doesn't
operate
that
way,
your
honor.
the
contracts
provide
that
the
utilities
have
to
deliver
feed.
and
it's
a
very
different
sort
of
business
that
the
utilities
are
engaged
in,
to
go
out
into
the
market
and
make
bets
based
on
the
price
fluctuations
for
uranium
and
procure
that
uranium.
the
enrichers
are
not
in
that
business,
and
so
there
would
be
no
economic
reason
or
any
reason
provided
for
in
the
contracts
for
them
to
proceed
that
way.
i
would
like
to
touch
briefly,
if
i
can,
on
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
because
the
government
relies
very
strongly
on
this
notion
that
somehow
the
processors'
sales
have
to
cognizable
in
order
to
further
the
antidumping
statute.
this
law
is
not
a
boundless
license
to
protect
domestic
industry
from
any
competition.
there
are
other
statutes
that
are
are
written
much
more
broadly
in
the
trade
laws;
for
example,
the
countervailing
duties
law,
the
safeguards
law
which
allows
the
department
of
commerce
to
impose
quotas
or
tariffs
on
the
import
--
not
the
sale
but
the
import
of
any
goods,
statutes
regarding
the
protection
of
intellect0ual
property
rights,
all
of
which
are
cited
in
the
--
in
the
briefs.
so
the
notion
that
somehow
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
statute
you
need
to
rewrite
it
to
allow
them
to
address
processing
sales
exclusively
is
really
not
--
not
well-founded.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
loophole
question
that
the
government
has
relied
on,
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
what
is
specifically
at
issue
here.
the
government
initially
argued
that
it
was
critical
to
address
this
case
and
these
particular
transactions
because
of
concerns
about
agreements
with
the
russians.
that
has
been
addressed
as
to
u.s.
concedes
in
its
reply
brief
by
--
legislation
that
has
been
implemented
by
congress.
the
government
has
consistently
in
court
and
in
its
decisions
--
not
just
in
the
contract
disputes
act
that
you
referenced
justice
ginsburg,
but
in
other
cases
regarding
the
ucc
which
relates
to
the
sale
of
goods,
the
government
has
said:
these
very
kinds
of
contracts
for
the
processing
of
uranium
are
contracts
for
services.
they
are
not
covered
by
statutes
that
reach
the
sale
of
goods
or
the
disposal
of
property.
there
is
nothing
that
has
changed
with
regard
to
the
statute
or
with
regard
to
these
kinds
of
transactions;
and,
accordingly,
we
would
ask
you
to
affirm
the
federal
circuit.
if
there
are
no
other
questions--
