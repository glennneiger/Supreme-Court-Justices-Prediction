mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
submit,
as
the
questions
this
morning
have
indicated,
one
of
the
difficulties
in
this
case,
obviously,
is
this
is
the
kind
of
transaction
that
can
be
thought
about
reasonably
enough
in
different
ways.
it
is
possible
to
look
at
this
very
narrow
set
of
circumstances
where
a
customer
is
providing
raw
materials
of
the
kind
that
the
producer
uses
to
make
a
good,
and
to
say
in
that
circumstance
we
could
look
at
it
as
the
customer
providing
two
kinds
of
consideration
for
the
good
it's
receiving;
or
we
could
look
at
it,
as
the
respondents
do
and
as
the
federal
circuit
did,
as
saying,
the
other
way
to
look
at
it
is
this
is
essentially
the
customer
receiving
a
service
on
its
own
goods.
now
it
seems
to
me
to
begin
with,
the
question
that
is
before
the
court
properly
is
whether
commerce,
which
is
undoubtedly
the
agency
charged
with
enforcing
this
statute,
has
adopted
a
reasonable
view
when
it's
taken
one
of
those
two
positions.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
okay.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
several
things
about
that,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief,
commerce
did
have
a
policy
prior
to
the
tolling
regulation,
where
it
did
treat
these
kinds
of
transactions
as
sales
of
goods.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
in
our
brief.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
have--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--but
it's
in--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--where
we
discuss
commerce's
tolling
precedent.
and
then
it
went
and
it
essentially
decided
that
what
it
had
done
in
that
precedent,
it
wanted
to
reexamine
that,
because
it
thought
in
the
end
what
was
happening
in
all
of
those
cases
is
there
was
a
resale
of
the
merchandise;
and
it
thought
it
would
be
a
better
practice
to
focus
on
that
sale
of
the
merchandise
for
purposes
of
applying
the
statute.
when
it
did
that,
however,
it
found
it
had
created
a
loophole
in
the
case
where
there
wasn't
a
further
sale.
so
it
has
gone
back
to
that.
so
at
least
in
terms
of
the
precedent,
commerce
has
been
on
different
sides
of
that,
but
they
have
been
wrestling
with
exactly
the
problem
that
i
outlined
at
the
beginning,
which
is
dealing
with
a
question
that
essentially
has
no
ready
answer
to
it
and
trying
to
pick
among
the
plausible
answers
that
were
available
to
it.
secondly,
just
about
the
specific
situation
here,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
chance
that
the
utilities
and
the
enricher
in
this
case
could
claim
unfair
surprise
or
unjust
reliance;
because
they
say
in
their
own
briefs,
they
did
not
set
their
transactions
up
in
this
way
in
order
to
try
to
comply
with
prior
decisions
of
commerce.
they
say
--
they
make
a
point
in
their
brief
in
saying
we
have
perfectly
innocent
intentions
here,
that
they
set
their
transactions
up
purely
for
historical
and
commercial
reasons.
so
--
now,
the
other
question
that
justice
breyer
raises
is
about
the
cases,
and
justice
ginsburg
i
think
mentioned
earlier
the
florida
power
&
light
decision.
and
again,
florida
power
&
light
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
agency
that
is
before
the
court.
so
at
that
point
there
is
no
question
of
chevron
deference,
no
question
of
whether
this
is
a
reasonable
position;
all
that
the
court
had
to
decide
was,
given
the
possible
choices,
which
did
it
think
was
the
better
choice
under
those
circumstances?
and
particularly
i
think
it's
important
in
that
case,
is
the
federal
circuit
said,
this
is
a
case
that
doesn't
fall
readily
into
either
of
the
two
categories.
so
it
went
ahead
and
had
to
decide
it
on
its
own.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
say
in
a
case
with
an
agency
involved,
and
the
agency
has
made
one
determination,
that
a
case
could
fall
within
either
of
categories
--
of
categories--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--no,
there
are
not,
your
honor,
that
i
am
aware
of.
but--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
do
think
so,
although
i
must
say
the
line
between
the
two
is
not
enormously
clear
to
me,
to
be
honest.
but
--
but
the
fact
is
if
i
were
trying
to
figure
out
where
on
the
side
of
the
line
it
goes,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
you
are
talking
about
the
application
of
a
legal
standard
to
a
particular
set
of
circumstances.
i
mean,
in
chevron,
you
have
the
situation,
is
a
certain
kind
of
facility
a
stationary
source
or
whatever?
i
mean
that
--
you
could
say,
well,
that
is
a
factual
question
in
some
way,
but
it
seems
to
me
ultimately
the
better
way
to
think
about
it
is
commerce's
responsibility
is
to
interpret
the
law
in
the
light
of
cases
that
come
up.
i
mean,
an
agency
does
not
--
is
not
expected
by
congress
just
to
sit
back
and
imagine
all
the
possible
situations
that
could
be
a
sale
of
merchandise.
i
think
what
the
agency
is
supposed
to
do
is,
confronted
with
the
circumstance
in
a
particular
transaction,
to
apply
its
judgment
on
the
statutory
language
and
say,
yes,
we
do
think
this
is
a
sale
of
merchandise
or
no,
we
don't.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
--
the
narrowest
interpretation,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
one
that
is
most
readily
dealt
with
is,
to
say,
in
a
situation
where
a
customer
provides
raw
material
that
is
the
type
of,
but
not
the
precise
raw
material,
used
by
a
manufacturer
to
make
the
good
that
it
then
delivers
to
the
customer,
in
that
situation,
we
are
going
to
treat
the
manufacturer
as
having
made
a
sale
of
that
good
for
the
consideration
of
the
cash
and
the
raw
material.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
it
does,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
this
sense,
that
we
are
talking
about
the
sale
of
the
merchandise
and
that
is
a
new
good.
so
the
substantial
transformation
is
essentially
what
moves
the
ball
from
--
from
being
the
--
the
raw
material
supplied
by
the
customer
to
something
different.
and
the
question
would
be
in
this
case,
could
commerce
reasonably
think
that
the
manufacturer
had
sufficient
control
over
the
new
good
to
be
deemed
the
owner
of
that?
and
i
think
it's
important
to
look,
if
you
look
at
the
--
there
are
two
different
commodities
that
are
being
talked
about
in
the
case
of
this
transaction:
one
is
the
feedstock,
the
raw
material;
the
other
is
the--
leu.
and
the
idea
that
the
respondents
posit
is,
well,
this
is
just
a
service
performed
on
our
material.
all
we
are
doing
is
getting
our
material
back
after
a
service
has
been
performed
on
it.
but
as
everybody
agrees,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
simply
not
so.
they
are
not
getting
their
material
back
with
a
service
performed
on
it.
they
are
getting
a
product
that
has
been
produced,
manufactured,
from
raw
material
that
is
fungible
and
in
the
general
inventory
of
the
manufacturer.
and
in
that
case,
it
seems
to
me,
commerce
can
say,
we
are
going
to
disregard
the
fiction
of
the
parties'
contracts
that
say
this
really
is
made
from
our
material,
and
say
we
are
going
to
look
at
the
actual
nature
of
the
transaction.
and
in
the
actual
nature
of
the
transaction,
as
i
said,
it
is
not
made
from
their
material.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
i
don't
think
commerce
would
say
that.
i
am
to
some
extent
speaking
for
them
here.
but
i
think
what
commerce
would
say
is,
when
you
have
a
fungible
raw
material
in
substantial
transformation
without--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
think
that
commerce
would
say,
if
you
have
both,
that
clearly
can
be
regarded
as
a
sale
of
merchandise,
and
we
will
regard
it
as
a
sale
of
merchandise.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
only
have
substantial
transformation
but
not
fungibility,
then
i
believe
commerce
would
say,
even
in
that
situation,
because
it's
ultimately
the
effect
on
the
domestic
competitor
is
exactly
the
same,
we
would
retain
the
discretion
to
treat
even
that
as
a
sale
of
merchandise.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
would
emphasize
that's
not
the
case.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
because
of
the
different
circumstances,
under
the
common
law,
for
example,
i
should
make
very
clear
--
but
i
should
make
first
my
answer
to
you,
justice
stevens.
under
the
common
law,
the
particular
transaction
we
were
dealing
with
here,
where
it
is
not
made
from
the
identical
material,
is
clearly
a
sale
under
the
common
law.
but
if
you
--
if
commerce
were
going
to
say,
in
a
situation
where
it
is
made
from
the
identical
material,
we
want
to
depart
from
the
common
law,
i
think
they
would
have
to
justify
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
pardon
me?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
in
the
end,
i
think,
in
the
commercial
setting,
there
is
a
reasonable
chance,
not
necessarily
certain
because
you
do
have
the
ucc
and
you
have
the
possibility,
in
those
situations,
the
courts
might
say,
in
a
commercial
setting,
we
are
going
to
pay
more
attention
to
the
parties'
efforts
to
structure
their
contracts
in
a
particular
way,
so
that
between
them,
we
are
going
to
treat
the
contract
differently.
all
our
position
is,
is
that
commerce,
in
applying
the
antidumping
law
to
protect
a
third
party
doesn't
have
to
observe
the
fictions
in
the
parties'
contract.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you.
