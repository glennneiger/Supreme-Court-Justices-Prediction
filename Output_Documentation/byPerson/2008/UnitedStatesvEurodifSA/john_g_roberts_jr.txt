john
g.
roberts,

we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-1059,
united
states
v.
eurodif
and
07-1058,
usec
v.
eurodif.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
articulate
precisely
what
your
test
is,
because
you
have
been
going
back
and
forth
between
whether
the
raw
materials
are
fungible
and
whether
there
is
a
fundamental
transformation
in
the
product?
so,
how
would
you
merge
those
two
in
an
articulable
test
so
that
business
people
can
know
when
they
are
going
to
be
subject
to
this
regime
and
when
they
were
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would
say
your
ultimate
touchstone
is
whether
there
is
substantial
transformation,
and
whether
it's
a
raw
material
or
discretion,
those
go
into
that
determination?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sure
you're
prepared
for
a
wide
variety
of
hypotheticals.
what
about
a
diamond?
you
have
a
chunk
of
rock
that
contains
a
diamond.
you
send
it
to
antwerp
and
they
carve
it
away
into
something
that,
i
guess
you
could
say
it's
been
substantially
transformed.
it's
not
just
a
rock.
it's
now
a
glittering
diamond.
is
that
covered
by--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--neither
am
i,
and
it's
kind
of
--
it's
sort
of
a
bit
of
a
concern.
it's
a
fluctuating
test
that
is
hard
to
determine
how
it's
going
to
be
applied
in
a
wide
variety
of
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
farr.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
we
are
to
defer
to
the
agency's
interpretation,
what
--
how
would
you
phrase
its
interpretation,
apart
from
"this
is
a
sale"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
doesn't
matter
whether
there
is
a
substantial
transformation
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
--
so
that
is
the
critical
factor,
whether
it's
made
from
their
material,
regardless
of
whether
there
is
a
transformation?
if
the
domestic
entity
provides
wood,
wooden
two-by-fours,
and
the
foreign
entity
coats
it
in
a
certain
way,
but
they
can
use
any
two-by-fours,
they
are
indistinguishable,
you
would
say
in
that
case
there's
still
--
that's
still
subject
to
commerce's
position?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
got
to
be
both?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
halligan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
do
about
the
substance
versus
formality
question?
i
mean,
if
you
do
have
fungible
raw
materials,
why
should
it
make
a
difference
whether
the
domestic
company
supplies
those
to
the
foreign
company
or
simply
says
--
gives
them
money
and
says,
buy
them
yourselves?
and
in
the
latter
case,
you
would
say
that's
a
sale,
and
in
the
former
case
you
would
say
it's
not
a
sale?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
--
you
don't
retain
ownership
of
that.
and
if
you
go
to
the
bank
and
say:
show
me
my
money,
they
are
not
going
to
say:
well,
here's
your
money.
they
--
they
have
title
to
it.
they
own
it,
and
you
have
a
claim
against
the
bank
to
what
you
gave
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
if
they
go
bankrupt
because
--
i
mean
let's
say
they
don't
have
all
the
uranium.
they
have
got
five
people
who
shipped
them
uranium,
and
they
have
only
got
enough
for
four.
each
of
the
five
can't
say:
i'm
entitled
to
get
mine
back.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
halligan.
mr.
stewart,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
the
case
is
submitted.
