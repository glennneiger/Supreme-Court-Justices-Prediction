that's
only
--
that's
only
true
because
apparently
they
use
up
all
the
feed
that
they
get.
if,
in
fact,
they
found
a
way
to
manufacture
to
enrich
more
efficiently
so
that
some
feed
was
left
over,
i
presume
you
would
not
be
here
arguing
that
they
could
not
sell
that
feed
on
the
open
market
even
after
they
had
delivered
the
enriched
uranium
to
the
buyer?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
why
are
they
providing
something
that
is
very
valuable
that,
in
fact,
could
not
be
obtained
by
the
enricher
on
the
open
market
if
those
were
the
contract
terms?
the
enricher
buys
it
in
the
--
in
the
--
i
forget
the
acronym
in
the
case
that
you
just
described
--
and
we
don't
know
--
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
the
enricher
couldn't
go
out
on
the
market
and
buy
it
if,
in
fact,
the
utility
didn't
supply
the
feed.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
they
would
rather
manage
the
risk
of
price
fluctuation
than,
in
effect,
pay
the
premium
that
the
processor
would
have
to
charge
in
order
to
hedge
against
price
fluctuation--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
why
they
are
doing
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
a
way
of
looking
at
it.
but
another
way
of
looking
at
it
is
because
they
choose
to,
in
effect,
take
the
risk
of
price
fluctuation
as
preferable
to
paying
a
higher
ultimate
price,
they
are
simply,
for
that
reason,
choosing
to
pay
both
in
cash
and
in
a
--
a
valuable
commodity,
i.e.,
unenriched
uranium.
you
can
look
at
it
either
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
third
and
final
statement
that
i
have
this
morning
is
in
no.
7-1078,
united
states
against
eurodif,
et
al.,
and
a
companion
case,
united
states
against
a
company
known
as
usec,
inc.,
and
others.
this
case
has
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
section
731
of
the
tariff
act
of
1930
calls
for
what
it
calls
antidumping
duties
on
foreign
merchandise
sold
in
the
united
states
at
less
than
its
fair
value,
but
the
act
does
not
touch
international
sales
of
services.
these
cases
are
about
the
application
of
this
provision
to
exchanges
of
low
enriched
uranium
known
as
leu,
a
highly
processed
derivative
of
natural
uranium
that
nuclear
utilities
use
to
make
fuel
rods.
utilities
occasionally
buy
leu
from
foreign
suppliers
for
a
single
payment
in
cash.
usually
however,
they
provide
unenriched
uranium
to
a
foreign
enricher
together
with
enough
cash
to
pay
for
the
energy
needed
to
convert
the
unenriched
uranium
to
leu,
and
that
--
that
energy
is
known
in
the
industry
as
“separative
work
units”
or
this
is
the
way
they
pronounce
it
or
“swoo”.
these
swu
contracts
treat
the
transaction
as
a
sale
of
uranium
enrichment
services.
the
commerce
department,
however,
determined
that
swu
contracts
resolved
in
the
sale
of
goods
and
therefore
covered
by
section
731.
the
respondents,
a
foreign
enricher
and
a
coalition
of
domestic
utilities,
challenged
this
determination
before
the
court
of
international
trade,
which
agreed
with
them
and
reversed.
the
federal
circuit
then
affirmed
agreeing
with
the
court
of
international
trade
that
swu
contracts
are
clearly
contracts
of
the
sale
of
services
not
goods.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
reversed,
because
congress
charged
the
commerce
department
with
administering
section
731,
the
department's
interpretation
governs
unless
it
conflicts
with
unambiguous
statutory
language
whereas
an
unreasonable
resolution
of
statutory
ambiguity.
although
the
distinction
in
731
between
goods
and
services
is
clear
in
many
situations,
it
breaks
down,
whereas
in
a
case
like
this,
a
combination
of
cash
and
a
commodity
here
exchanged
for
a
product
that
uses
that
very
commodity
as
a
constituent
material.
we
therefore
asked
whether
by
applying
731
to
swu
contracts,
the
commerce
department
unreasonably
resolved
the
statutory
ambiguity.
in
concluding
that
swu
contracts
result
in
a
sale
of
leu,
the
department
found
that
the
parties
treat
the
unenriched
uranium
as
a
fungible
commodity
and
that
the
enricher
in
economic
reality
owns
the
leu
that
provides
the
utilities
prior
to
delivering
it
to
them.
the
department
emphasized
that
the
enrichment
process
works
what
it
called
a
substantial
transformation
on
unenriched
uranium
and
creates
the
essential
character
of
leu.
these
two
facts
in
combination,
the
exchange
of
an
untracked
fungible
commodity
and
a
substantial
transformation
of
that
same
commodity
reasonably
capture
a
common
understanding
of
the
sale
of
a
good.
moreover,
these
criteria
find
support
in
the
purposes
of
antidumping
duties,
which
is
to
protect
domestic
industry
from
unfairly
priced
foreign
products.
if
as
the
respondents
urge
swu
contracts
were
beyond
the
reach
of
section
731,
many
other
transactions
could
be
restructured
to
circumvent
antidumping
duties
as
well.
contracts
for
imported
pasta
would
be
replaced
by
separate
contracts
for
wheat
and
wheat
processing
services,
sweater
imports
would
give
way
to
separate
contracts
for
wool
and
knitting
services,
and
the
antidumping
duties
would
primarily
chastise
the
uncreative.
the
commerce
department's
attempt
to
foreclose
this
absurd
result
by
treating
swu
transactions
as
sale
of
goods
is
eminently
reasonable.
