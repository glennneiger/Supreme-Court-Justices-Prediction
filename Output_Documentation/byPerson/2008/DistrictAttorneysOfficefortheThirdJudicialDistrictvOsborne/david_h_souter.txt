justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he's
--
he's
not
--
at
this
point
all
he's
doing
is
seeking
evidence.
we
don't
know
--
he
doesn't
know,
presumably
--
exactly
what
that
evidence
is
going
to
show.
the
evidence
may
prove
to
be
exonerating
and
it
may
not
be.
until
one
knows
the
tendency
of
the
evidence,
one
can't
say
that
we
have
a
preiser
problem.
so
if
--
if
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
a
problem,
then
i
don't
see
--
i
guess
i
don't
follow
your
argument
that
this
necessarily
sounds
in
habeas.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
and
if
he
was
seeking
damages
in
this
1983
action
for
false
imprisonment
or
--
or
imprisonment
under
an
invalid
conviction,
i
would
understand
your
argument.
but
what
he
is
saying
in
effect
is:
i
want
process
to
know
what
this
evidence
has
to
say;
and
that
is
not
seeking
damages,
and
it's
not
seeking
release.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
the
difference
--
the
difference
is
that
if
he
succeeds
in
this
case
in
getting
access
to
the
evidence,
that
doesn't
get
him
outside
or
--
or
even
in
position
to
go
outside
the
prison
door.
all
it
does
is
get
him
some
evidence
to
test.
and
what
he
does
with
that
later,
if
he
finds
it
favorable,
presumably
is
necessarily
going
to
be
in
habeas.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he's
got
to
because
he
doesn't
know
whether
he
has
any
evidence
of
actual
innocence
at
this
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
he's
not
asserting
it.
he
just
says:
i
want
to
get
to
this
evidence
and
see
what
it
has
to
say.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
has
a
singular
objective
in
getting
the
evidence,
but
we
don't
know
what
the
evidence
means.
the
evidence
may
conclusively
prove
that
he
is
guilty,
for
all
we
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
a
--
that's
--
that's
a
fair
way
of
putting
it,
but
what
he
--
i
think
ultimately
his
strongest
argument
or
his
--
his
basic
argument
is,
this
evidence
is
potentially
so
important
that
the
state
has
no
valid
interest
in
keeping
me
at
least
from
seeing
it;
i.e.,
testing
it.
and
you
can
call
that
discovery
if
you
want
to,
but
it's
something
very
different
from
the
normal
discovery
that
goes
on
as
--
as
an
ancillary
process
to
a
--
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
that
--
that
may
be.
i'm
not
getting
into
that
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
know
that
they're
--
they're
arguing
with
you
on
that
score.
what
they
--
what
they
are
saying
--
i
think
what
they're
saying,
and
this
goes
to
a
variety
of
--
justice
scalia's
question
is
that
under
the
alaska
statute,
in
order
to
get
to
the
evidence,
or
indeed
in
order
to
make
his
--
his
postconviction
claim,
he's
got
to
claim
that
the
--
that
the
evidence
of
material
fact
requires
vacation
of
the
conviction
or
sentence.
and
his
argument
is,
i
don't
know
whether
it
requires
it;
because
i
haven't
been
able
to
test
it.
what
i
want
is
to
test
it.
and
as
i
understand
it,
under
this
particular
statute,
he
has
no
chance
of
doing
so
because
he
can't
tell
you
in
advance
what
the
test
is
going
to
show.
that's
--
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
first
tell
me
whether
that's
correct
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
doesn't
know
what
the
test
is
going
to
--
he
doesn't
know
what
the
test
is
going
to
show;
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
--he
cannot
say
that
it
requires
vacation
of
the
conviction;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
mr.
osborne
doesn't
know
what
that
evidence
is
going
to
show.
justice
david
h.
souter
he
hasn't
tested
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
whether
--
whether
he
believes
he's
innocent
or
whether
he
doesn't
believe
he's
innocent,
he
can
walk
into
court,
as
i
understand
it,
and
say,
i
am
absolutely
innocent.
but
what
he
cannot
do
prior
to
testing
the
evidence
is
tell
you,
is
allege
that
the
evidence
is
going
to
require
the
vacation
of
the
conviction.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
katyal,
the
--
the
right
that
they're
asserting
may
be
located
not
in
procedural,
but
in
substantive
due
process.
and
what
i
--
what
i
would
like
you
to
comment
on
is
what
the
government's
or
any
government's
interest,
the
united
states
or
that
of
a
state,
may
--
may
be
in,
in
effect,
in
denying
that
there
should
be
such
a
right.
and
this
question
occurred
to
me
when
i
was
going
through
the
briefs:
what
if
--
we'll
make
this
federal
for
your
sake
--
what
if
the
united
states
had
imprisoned
an
individual
who
came
forward
and
said:
nobody
realized
it,
but
i
was
an
eyewitness
to
the
crime
for
which
x
is
--
is
--
has
been
convicted
and
is
currently
being
incarcerated;
and,
in
fact,
i
saw
that
crime
committed
and
he
did
not
commit
it.
x's
lawyer
arrives
at
this
individual's
prison
and
says:
i
want
to
talk
to
the
guy.
would
the
united
states
have
an
interest
in
saying,
you
cannot
talk
to
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
know,
prisoners
say
all
sorts
of
things.
we
--
we
don't
know
whether
in
the
long
run
it
is
going
to
be
exculpatory
or
whether
this
guy
has
some
axe
to
grind.
but
the
question
is,
would
the
united
states
have
any
legitimate
interest
in
saying
to
x's
lawyer,
you
can't
even
talk
with
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
you
need
a
rule,
i
guess
is
what
i'm
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
okay--
justice
david
h.
souter
--are
you
starting
with
the
premise
that
the
united
states
would
not
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
my
hypothetical
in
saying,
you
can't
even
talk
to
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
that
if
you
let
this
guy
talk
to
--
x's
lawyer
talk
to
this
guy,
other
individuals
may
say,
boy,
i
can
have
my
moment
in
the
sun,
too;
i'm
going
to
claim
this.
you
know,
let's
assume
the
worst
case
there.
would
you
still
say
--
would
the
government
still
say,
we
have
an
interest
for
that
reason
in
not
even
letting
him
talk
to
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
haven't
gotten
to
the
constitutional
law
yet.
i
just
--
i
just
want
to
know
whether
--
whether
there
would
be
a
legitimate
interest
in
saying
no.
i
mean,
you
can
see--
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
irrationality
ultimately
that
they
require
a
--
an
assertion,
with
some
basis
for
the
assertion,
that
in
fact
there
is
evidence
that
would
show
innocence?
is
the
irrationality
the
cart
before
the
horse?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
were--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'll
put
it
quickly.
you
--
you
were
asked
a
question
earlier
what
it
was
in
effect
about
the
alaska
procedure
which
--
which
in
effect
was
--
was
constitutionally
frustrating.
i
understood
that
you
did
not
claim
that
the
requirement
to
claim
innocence
was
the
problem,
although
they
did
require
that;
but
that
the
--
that
the
real
problem
was
that
you
not
only
had
to
claim
innocence;
you
had
to
be
in
a
position
to
claim
that
the
evidence
you
were
seeking
would
exonerate
you.
and
in
the
dna
case
you
couldn't
do
that,
ultimately,
until
it
had
been
tested.
and
so
it
was
that
second
point,
in
effect
that
they
are
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse
--
tell
us
what
the
test
is
going
to
show
before
you
test
it
--
that
i
thought
was
the
sticking
point
for
you.
am
i
correct
about
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
--
that
goes
--
that
goes
to
the
first
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
--
i
was
concerned
with
the
second.
i
will
be
happy
to
get
back
to
the
first,
but
i
just
want
to
know
your
position
on
the
second,
the
cart
before
the
horse
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
shouldn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--whether
1983
requires
it
depends
in
part
on
whether
we
recognize
a
free-standing
right
to
test
dna
evidence.
as
i
--
as
i
conceive
it,
that
sounds
to
me
like
substantive
due
process
and
rightly
so.
one
condition
for
recognizing
a
substantive
due
process
right
could
be
that
the
individual
claiming
the
right
to
test
claims
that
he
is
actually
innocent.
what
would
be
unreasonable
about
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
your
client
prepared
to
make
that
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not
asking
you.
i'm
asking
for
his
position
through
counsel
now.
do
you
know?
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
defense--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
he
walks
into
court
and
swears,
"i
am
innocent,
subject
to
penalties
of
perjury.
"
"please
let
me
look
at
the
dna.
"
as
i
understand
your
answer,
your
answer
will
be,
"we
will
then
raise
issues
of
procedural
default,
waiver.
"
et
cetera.
you
will
not
say,
on
the
contrary:
"let
him
look
at
the
dna.
"
is
that
--
is
my
understanding
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any--
