chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
08-6,
district
attorney's
office
for
the
third
judicial
district
v.
osborne.
mr.
rosenstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the
state
routinely
keep
evidence
of
the
sort
osborne
is
seeking
available?
or
is
there
a
cutoff
point
at
which
they
dispose
of
the
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
we'll
afford
you
rebuttal
time
since
the
court
used
up
your
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
neufeld.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
was
a
more
reliable
one
at
the
time
of
trial
as
well,
and
his
counsel
made
the
tactical
decision
not
to
use
it
because,
i
assume,
she
was
concerned
it
would
show
his
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
whole
point
is
that,
justice
ginsburg
brought
out
the
point,
that
he
hasn't
asserted
his
innocence
under
oath.
so
there's
no
cost
to
him
for
asking
for
the
dna
evidence.
if
there's
--
if
we're
writing
up
a
new
constitutional
right
and
we
require
as
part
of
that
that
he
assert
his
innocence
under
perjury,
and
if
he
fails
to
do
that,
he'll
be
prosecuted
for
perjury,
that
might
at
least
put
some
limitation
on
the
number
of
people
who
can
assert
the
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
it
is
so
clear--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--sorry,
counsel.
if
it
is
so
clear
that
this
is
the
right
way
to
go,
that
the
federal
government,
41
states
--
does
it
make
sense
for
us
to
devise
a
constitutional
right
to
displace
what
the
legislatures
have
done?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
exactly
a
question
of
displacing
what
the
states
have
done,
because
now
this
question
is
going
to
be
subject
to
constitutional
law
and
it's
going
to
be
litigated
in
a
variety
of
cases
with
a
variety
of
claims.
do
you
get
the
right
to
it
when
you've
confessed?
do
you
get
the
right
to
it
when
you've
waived
it
at
trial?
do
you
get
the
continuous
right
to
it
as
technology
advances
and
makes
the
test
more
sensitive?
all
of
those
matters
will
be
federal
constitutional
questions
for
us
to
decide.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
whole
question
--
it
is
kind
of
along
the
same
lines
i've
been
talking.
the
reason
they're
might
--
they're
saying
don't
adopt
that
test
is
because
the
question
is
whether
it
should
be
adopted
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
they
may,
and
i
suspect
they
do
since
they
represent
the
government,
think
congress's
balancing
is
--
makes
perfect
sense.
it
is
a
different
question
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
just
to
get
back
to
the
point
you
were
making
earlier,
it
really
doesn't
matter
what
the
congress
said.
it
is
a
question
of
rationality
under
the
constitution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
his
assertion
before
the
--
his
confession
--
his
confessions
before
the
parole
board
made
under
oath?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
he's
guilty
of
perjury
one
way
or
the
other,
either
before
the
parole
board
or
in
his
assertions
of
actual
innocence
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
wouldn't
it
be
ironic--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--excuse
me,
counsel.
would
it
be
ironic
to
say
that
you
do
not
have
access
when
you're
guilty
of
perjury
one
way
or
the
other?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
you
have
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--would
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
the
dna
evidence
if
the
accuracy
of
the
test
was
the
same
as
the
one
that
your
counsel
submitted
at
trial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
limits
it
to
--
what
was
it
--
16
percent
or
something
like
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
all
right.
then,
obviously,
the
next
question
is
at
what
level
of
accuracy
does
your
constitutional
right
no
longer
apply?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
so
to
follow
up
on
that.
so
you
--
if
--
if
the
evidence
showed
that
there
was
--
it
would
show
that
there
was
a
one
out
of
two
chance
that
your
client
was
innocent,
then
you
think
you
still
have
a
right
--
a
constitutional
right
of
access
to
that
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
fingerprint
--
fingerprints
apparently
are
covered
by
it.
they
have
fingerprint
evidence
that
they
are
not
releasing.
so
do
you
have
a
constitutional
right
of
access
to
that
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
sure--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sure
they're
not
as
accurate
as
the
dna
tests.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
limit
of
the
constitutional
right
you're
asserting
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sorry.
i'm
sorry.
with
the
different
questions,
i
have
lost
where
the
answer
is.
you
say
it
is
still
part
of
the
constitutional
right
if
he
forewent
the
test
at
trial,
or
it
is
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
there
was
a
videotape?
is
that
covered
by
the
constitutional
right
you
are
asserting?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
photographs
or
other
evidence
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
a
good
point.
what
--
how
long
under
the
constitution
does
the
state
have
to
retain
this
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
that
be
a
corollary
of
the
constitutional
right
you
are
asking
for
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
agree
that
would
be
--
that
--
yes.
i
am
just
wondering
if
there
would
be
any
objection
to
an
absolute
rule
that
says
what
--
after
two
years,
after
one
year
of
conviction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
he
released
on
parole
with
respect
to
this
offense?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
was
his
confession
a
necessary
predicate
to
that
release?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
a
confession
that
would
be
perjurious
if
he
claimed
actual
innocence
now
was
responsible
for
his
release?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
understand
--
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
he's
been
--
other
than
other
crimes
he
committed,
he's
been
released
on
the
basis
of
what
you
say
is
an
unprincipled
confession.
and
now
he
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
his
parole
was
revoked
because
he
committed
another
offense?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
we'll
give
you
three
more
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
we
do
it
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
stevens.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
case
08-6,
district
attorney's
office
versus
osborne.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
access
dna
evidence
outside
of
a
state's
established
procedures
for
providing
it.
the
respondent,
william
osborne
was
convicted
in
alaska
state
court
of
kidnapping,
sexual
assault,
and
other
crimes.
the
appellate
courts
reviewing
his
conviction
found
no
errors
at
the
trial.
years
later,
osborne
filed
this
federal
lawsuit
seeking
access
to
biological
evidence
from
the
crime
scene
so
that
he
could
subject
it
to
dna
testing.
after
two
rounds
of
litigation,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
he
had
a
constitutional
right
to
dna
testing
under
the
due
process
clause.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
that
decision.
dna
testing
has
an
unparalleled
ability
both
to
exonerate
the
wrongly
convicted
and
to
identify
the
guilty.
the
question
is
how
to
harness
dna's
power
to
prove
innocence
in
the
established
criminal
justice
system.
answering
that
question
is
a
task
that
belongs
primarily
to
the
legislature.
46
states
and
the
federal
government
have
already
enacted
statutes
dealing
specifically
with
access
to
dna
evidence.
these
laws
recognize
the
value
of
dna
testing,
but
also
the
need
for
conditions
on
accessing
the
state's
evidence.
alaska
is
one
of
the
handfuls
of
states
yet
to
enact
specific
dna
testing
legislation,
but
alaska
courts
are
applying
existing
discovery
procedures
to
this
noble
technology.
alaska
gives
prisoners
a
right
to
be
released
if
they
make
a
sufficiently
compelling
showing
that
they
are
actually
innocent.
alaska
also
provides
procedures
to
vindicate
that
right.
there
is
no
time
limit
on
bringing
an
actual
innocence
claim
under
alaska
law,
and
there
are
procedures
for
accessing
evidence
to
support
an
actual
innocence
claim.
alaska
courts
have
ruled
that
these
procedures
include
access
to
evidence
for
dna
testing
in
certain
circumstances.
there
are
some
restrictions
on
access
similar
to
the
ones
provided
by
federal
law
and
the
laws
of
other
states,
but
we
see
nothing
inadequate
about
those
procedures.
in
addition
to
challenging
the
adequacy
of
the
state's
procedures,
osborne
makes
a
far
more
reaching
argument
that
substantive
due
process
requires
us
to
recognize
a
free
standing
right
to
dna
evidence
outside
of
the
state
criminal
justice
system.
that
is
an
unprecedented
and
sweeping
approach
considering
whether
to
accept
that
approach
largely
turns
on
two
different
conceptions
of
the
role
of
the
federal
judiciary.
under
one
view,
the
federal
courts
should
generally
allow
congress
and
the
states
to
confront
new
technological
problems
and
they
should
be
hesitant
to
intervene
in
short
circuit
a
prompt
and
considered
legislative
response.
in
contrast,
under
osborne's
view,
the
federal
judiciary
must
leap
ahead
constitutionalizing
the
issue
and
taking
it
away
from
the
democratic
process.
we
favor
the
more
restrained
course.
congress
and
the
states
are
actively
legislating
in
the
area
of
dna
testing.
46
states
and
the
federal
government
have
already
passed
laws
on
the
subject.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
federal
judiciary
would
handle
the
issue
more
wisely
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
when
state
courts
and
legislatures
are
doing
as
a
matter
of
policy.
therefore,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
reject
osborne's
substantive
due
process
claim.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
justice
kennedy
has
joined
and
which
justice
thomas
has
joined
in
part.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined
and
which
justice
souter
joined
in
part.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
