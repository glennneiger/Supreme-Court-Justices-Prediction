justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
some
idea
of
how
many
cases
there
are
in,
say,
the
last
10
years
in
which
in
state
postconviction
proceedings
the
convicted
prisoner
has
asked
for
dna
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
three?
or
300?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
establish
innocence
in
some
cases
where
there
is
new
and
--
evidence
that
could
not
previously
have
been
discovered,
that
has
a
high
likelihood
of
exonerating?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
for
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
can
we
get
an
answer
to
justice
alito's
question?
a
hypothetical,
the
one
he
put:
could
you
put
that
condition
on
a
statute
or
a
rule
consistently
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
--
well,
let's
assume
that
counsel
and
the
defendant
--
after
full
discussion
and
being
fully
advised,
say
this
is
too
dangerous;
we
don't
want
the
dna
test;
we'll
shoot
the
dice;
we're
not
going
to
have
the
dna
test.
he
loses.
can
you
then
get
the
dna
test?
or,
as
justice
alito's
question
pointed
out,
could
you
have
a
condition
that
when
you've
made
this
conscious
choice,
you
lost
your
right
for
later
dna
testing?
that's
what
he
asked,
and
i
still
don't
have
the
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
seem
to
be
sympathetic
to
that
position.
but
as
justice
alito's
question
again
points
out,
what
you
are
doing
is
setting
up
a
game
in
which
it
would
be
really
unwise
to
have
the
dna
test.
take
your
chances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have
a
--
you
have
a
built-in
--
you
have
a
--
a
built-in
second
chance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
just
--
that's
just
not
sound
trial
strategy,
counsel,
and
you
know
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
that
--
on
that
point,
i
just
want
to
make
clear:
in
the
present
posture
of
this
case,
i
take
it
that
if
the
federal
innocence
protection
act
applied,
he
would
not
qualify?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
would
qualify.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no
--
well,
but
--
but
as
the
case
now
stands
he
does
not
qualify.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
the
case
now
stands,
he
does
not
qualify.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
--
you're,
in
effect,
asking
us
--
and
you
say
the
--
the
solicitor
general
appears
here
--
you're
--
you're,
in
effect,
asking
us
to
say
that
the
federal
witness
protection
act
on
these
facts
is
unconstitutional.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
--
may
i
just
ask
one
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
he
is
not
now
in
custody
for
this
offense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
for
this
offense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he's
being
held
on
other
charges.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
he's
not
now
in
custody
for
this
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
resist
that
request?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
cannot
confirm
that
you
would
acquiesce
and
recommend
that
he
get
the
dna
sample
under
those
conditions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
there
be
instances
when
you,
as
the
attorney
general
of
alaska,
would
waive
procedural
defaults,
in
order
to
determine
if
there
was
guilt
or
innocence
in
a
case
where
dna
conclusively
proved
it,
simply
because
of
your
interest
in
not
confining
innocent
people?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
you
can
say
in
answer
to
my
question,
as
to
your
particular
approach
to
your
duties
here,
is
that
that's
conceivable?
