justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
it
true
that
we've
had
dna
cases
where
the
person
has
been
found
innocent
despite
the
fact
they
confessed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
we
know
this
isn't
one
of
those
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
the
state
has
agreed
that
if
this
evidence
is
exonerating;
that
this
evidence
potentially
could
exonerate
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mentioned
the
floodgates.
there
are
seven
cases
in
this
state,
in
the
whole
history
of
alaska.
[laughter]
is
that
right?
and
that's
floodgates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
--
before
you
start,
would
you
--
i
want
you
to
clear
up
the
question
that
justice
breyer
asked.
assume
that
on
remand
he
would
now
make
the
declaration
under
perjury
that
he's
innocent.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
would
enable
him
to
get
discovery,
but
not
necessarily
to
say
he
would
get
the
dna
evidence.
am
i
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
don't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
your
answer,
as
i
understand
it,
is
he
can
now
apply
for
discovery,
but
you
don't
know
what
will
happen
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
net
result
is
that
it
is
perfectly
clear
to
me
from
the
argument
that
you
have
not
conceded
that
if
he
now
files
the
paper,
he
will
definitely
get
the
dna.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
