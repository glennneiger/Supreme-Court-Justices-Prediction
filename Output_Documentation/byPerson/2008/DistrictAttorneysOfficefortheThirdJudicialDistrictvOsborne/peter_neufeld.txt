mr.
peter
neufeld
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
absolutely
undisputed
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
dna
test
that
mr.
osborne
seeks
that
could
conclusively
prove
his
actual
innocence.
mr.
peter
neufeld
the
test
actually,
the
rflp
test
i
assume
you
are
referring
to,
is
not
actually
more
reliable.
it's
more
discriminating.
and
the
reason
it
didn't
get
used
--
even
the
prosecutor
didn't
want
to
use
it
as
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
they
felt
that
the
evidence
was
so
degraded
that
if
they
tried
using
that
test,
there
was
a
grave
risk
that
it
would
destroy
all
the
evidence
and
not
get
any
result.
and
that's
why
they
chose
that
dq
alpha
test,
which
is
more
sensitive,
albeit
not
as
discriminating.
mr.
peter
neufeld
respondent's
counsel
said
that
she
was
doing
it
for
strategic
reasons,
although
i
think
it
is
quite
important
that
mr.
osborne
at
all
points
said
he
wanted
the
testing,
okay,
and
that
his
counsel
rejected
his
advice.
he
even
wrote
to
a
nobel
prize
winner
to
see
what
he
could
do
about
getting
this
additional
testing.
mr.
peter
neufeld
justice
alito,
first
--
first
of
all,
he
was
never
asked
in
this
pleading
to
assert
his
actual
innocence.
as
represented
by
his
counsel--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--well,
no,
no.
it's
in
the
--
in
1983,
it
is
not
required
or
even
asked
that
he
make
that
kind
of
statement.
he
did
all
through
the
state
courts.
in
the
state
courts
he
always
asserted
his
innocence;
through
his
lawyers
he
asserted
his
innocence,
and
indeed--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--no,
because
it
wasn't
required.
indeed,
your
honor,
to
respond
directly
to
your
question,
to
both
of
your
questions,
if
this
court
decided,
as
justice
scalia
mentioned
before
as
well,
that
one
requirement
of
this
right
is
that
a
person
swear
under
the
penalties
of
perjury,
knowing
that
he
could
be
prosecuted,
that
he's
actually
innocent,
then
so
be
it.
it
can
be
remanded
for
that
purpose.
mr.
peter
neufeld
that
is
what
the
innocence
protection
act
requires,
and
no
one
has
opposed
that.
mr.
peter
neufeld
he
said
it,
but
i
don't
believe
that--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--well,
they
took
the
same
position
in
the
--
in
the
trial
court
in
alaska
they
said
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
dna
testing
under
the
postconviction
statute
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
peter
neufeld
well,
i
don't
believe
that
you
need
the
swearing
requirement,
because
he
has
previously
asserted
his
innocence;
but
what's
most
important
here--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--and
i
would
agree
with
that.
i
think
that's
an
excellent
idea.
and
the
problem
is
no
one's
suggesting
that
alaska
can't
do
that
as
a
restriction.
indeed
they
can,
but
alaska
has
had
no
mechanism
at
all.
mr.
peter
neufeld
that
contradicts
the
position
they
took
in
the
--
in
the
state
court,
your
honor.
they
specifically
said
in
the
state
courts
that
it
is
not
enough
to
simply
assert
one's
innocence;
that
you
actually
have
to
have
proofs,
facts
that
--
that
demonstrate
your
innocence
before
you
get
to
that
discovery.
it
is
a
catch-22
situation.
mr.
peter
neufeld
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
mean,
not
only
is
alaska
not
making
a
claim
that
he
did
not
act
with
due
diligence
here,
but
they're
not
doing
--
they're
making
that
claim
for
a
reason.
as
soon
as
he
finished
his
direct
appeal,
he
immediately
filed
a
pro
se
petition
seeking
postconviction
dna
testing,
within
months.
and
then
--
in
the
late
1990s.
and
then
eventually
he
was
assigned
a
public
defender
to
represent
him,
and
that
led
to
the
2001
filing
in
the
state
court
which
predated
the
2003
filing
in
the
federal
court.
so
he's
moved
as
quickly
as
he
possibly
could
as
soon
as
he
knew
that
there
was
this
powerful
evidence
that
could
be
dispositive.
this
is
the
very
first
case
litigated
to
our
knowledge
anywhere
in
the
country
where
the
prosecutor
concedes
that
a
dna
would
be
absolutely
slam-dunk
dispositive
of
innocence,
but
doesn't
consent
to
it.
mr.
peter
neufeld
well
it's
very--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--well,
that's--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--10
--
10
years
ago,
justice
scalia,
the
u.s.
department
of
justice
articulated
a
materiality
test
for
dna
testing;
and
they
said,
like
you're
saying:
yes,
let's
look
at
the
evidence
of
guilt;
but
then
let's
say
to
ourselves,
looking
out
of
the
other
eye,
what
if
there's
a
favorable
results?
what
impact
would
that
have
on
the
favorable
results?
that
was
the
position
adopted
by
the
united
states
department
of
justice
10
years
ago.
that
was
the
position,
of
course,
that
we're
urging
here.
that
was
the
position
adopted
by
the
u.s.
congress
five
years
ago,
and
that
materiality
test
has
been
adopted
by
41
states
to
date.
mr.
peter
neufeld
only
alaska--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--it
is
not
a
question
of
displacing
what
the
legislatures
have
done,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
a
question
of
when
the
state
of
alaska
chooses
to
provide
a
mechanism
for
postconviction
relief
--
and
here
they
do.
mr.
peter
neufeld
i
don't
think
necessarily,
your
honor.
i
think
first
of
all,
here
we
have
a
clean
slate
if
you
will,
because
there
were
no
mechanisms
passed
by
the
alaska
legislature.
we
have
seen,
and
which
is
interesting,
we
actually
think
the
innocence
protection
act
as
passed
by
congress
is
a
marvelous
statute
that
no
one
is
--
is
questioning
one
bit.
it
is
odd
that
the
solicitor
general
walks
into
this
courtroom
and
asks
this
court
to
adopt
a
materiality
test
that
was
rejected
by
congress.
the
one
that
we
are
asking
for
here
is
simply
that
you
look
at
the
evidence,
the
evidence
of
guilt
that
justice
scalia
pointed
out--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--well,
i
agree
with
you.
our
position
is,
is
that
the
test
that
they're
calling
for
here
is
irrational;
that
it's
completely
irrational
when
you
have
something
as
powerful
and
new
as
dna
evidence,
which
can
conclusively
--
unlike
any
other
forensic
discipline
that--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--that
is
--
that
is
correct.
i
only
use
what
congress
said
and
what
the
other
41
states
said
to
illustrate
how
there
is
an
overwhelming
consensus
now
that
to
do
it
the
way
that
alaska
wants
to
do
it
is
frankly
irrational.
mr.
peter
neufeld
i
think
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
peter
neufeld
please
interrupt
me
if
i
don't
and
i
apologize.
mr.
peter
neufeld
you
are
correct;
and
justice
souter,
they
never,
ever
said
in
--
in
their
brief,
in
their
petition
for
certiorari,
that
they
believed
that
a
condition
for
getting
the
test
should
be
that
a
person
swear
out
an
affidavit
asserting
innocence.
they
are
raising
that
now
in
a
reply
brief
a
week
before
this
oral
argument.
mr.
peter
neufeld
yes.
mr.
peter
neufeld
the
second
point
is
--
and
that
--
which
is
why
the
only
rational
test
is
--
the
catch-22
or
cart
before
the
horse
that
you're
referring
to
--
which
is
we
can't
speculate,
based
on
the
other
evidence,
whether
it's
going
to
be
a
dna
exclusion
or
a
dna
inclusion.
if
you
look
at
the
amicus
briefs
that
have
been
submitted
here
by
exonerees,
by
people
who
received
clemency,
all
kinds
of
people,
you
will
see
cases
where
the
evidence
of
guilt
was
much
more
overwhelming
than
it
was
here.
you
will
see
cases
where
50
percent
of
the
judges
that
reviewed
those
cases
found
the
evidence
to
be
very
compelling
evidence
of
guilt
or
indeed
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt,
but
nonetheless
dna
trumped
all
that
evidence
and
excluded
those.
mr.
peter
neufeld
i'm
not
ignoring
it
at
all;
i'm
simply
saying
that
1983,
by
its
very
nature,
doesn't
require
it,
and
alaska
practice--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--didn't
require
it,
but
if
you
do--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--there
would
--
nothing
would
be
unreasonable
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
neufeld
your
honor,
i
assume
he
certainly
would.
i--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--i
know
he
has
told
every
other
lawyer
who
has
represented
him
that
he
was
actually
innocent.
i--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--i
believe
it
was
made
under
oath,
your
honor--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--well,
wouldn't
it
be
ironic,
your
honor,
if
we
do
the
dna
test
and
he's
exonerated
and
it
proves
he
didn't
do
it
at
all,
that
then
the
state
went
ahead
and
prosecuted
him
for
perjury
because
he
did
something
just
so
he
knew
he
could
get
out
because,
under
alaskan
law,
unless
you
accept
responsibility,
you're
not
going
to
get
out.
mr.
peter
neufeld
two
of
our--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--i
think
that
would
be
terrible.
if
the
--
if
the
primary
goal
of
our
criminal
justice
system,
or
one
of
them,
is
that
someone
who
is
actually
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
he
is
serving
a
sentence
can't
--
okay
--
present
the
evidence
that
will
win
him
his
freedom.
he--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--i
think
that's
a
very
sound
approach
to
this,
justice
breyer.
mr.
peter
neufeld
it
has
that
added
advantage,
justice
breyer.
[laughter]
mr.
peter
neufeld
but
--
but,
quite
honestly,
we've
had
two
exonerees
that
are
pointed
out
in
the
prosecutors'
brief
and
in
the
exonerees'
brief
who
did
in
fact
that.
they
actually
said
to
the
parole
board,
yes,
they
were
guilty,
because
they
knew
that
was
the
only
way
they
could
get
out.
and
then
the
dna
testing
was
done
a
couple
of
years
later
and,
boom,
it
turned
out
they
were
completely
innocent.
mr.
peter
neufeld
well--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--i
think
you
would
--
probably
because
number
--
number
one--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--well,
the
constitutional
right
doesn't
apply
with
a
--
with
a
level
of
accuracy.
the
constitutional
right
applies
in
prohibiting
the
state
from
arbitrarily
preventing
you
access
to
the
evidence.
there's
a
very
compelling
record--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--no,
i
think
the
reason
you
have
it
here,
your
honor,
is
that
alaska
concedes
--
i
mean,
when
have
you
ever
heard
it
before
in
a
case?
alaska
concedes
that
this
powerful
dna
test
is
so
powerful
that
if
he
gets
a
favorable
result,
it
is
dispositive,
he
is
actually
innocent.
okay.
that's
how
powerful
this
is.
and
so
when
you
try
and
compare
this
to
other
types
of
either
earlier
dna
or
other
types
of
scientific
evidence,
you
can't.
and
it's
because
of
the
unique
power
of
these
strs,
and
the
codis
system,
which
allows
for
cold
hits.
so,
it's
not
just
the
232
people
who
have
been
exonerated.
we've
also
identified
in--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--well,
i
know
it's
slightly
outside
the
record,
but
just
this
week
the
national
academy
of
science
said
that
fingerprints
don't
have
the
same
indicia
of
reliability
that
these
dna
tests
have.
mr.
peter
neufeld
and--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--the
limit
is
--
the
limit
is
--
it's
the
same
limit,
if
you
will,
that
the
innocence
protection
act
articulated
--
and
at
least
41
of
the
states
that
passed
statutes
articulated,
and
by
common
law
the
other
states
all
gave
dna
testing,
the
ones
that
didn't
have
a
statute,
with
the
sole
exception
in
the
country
being
alaska
--
is,
if
there's
either
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
dna
tests
will
--
that
a
favorable
dna
test
result
can
prove
innocence,
okay,
and
you
did
not
--
you
know
--
that's
the
standard,
if
you
will,
okay,
to
get
the
test.
i
would
point
out
that
i
could
understand
people
having
some
disagreement
about
where
that
bar
should
be
in
terms
of
how
much
proof
of
innocence
the
test
would
provide.
mr.
peter
neufeld
i
hope--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--well,
again,
fibers
didn't
do
any
better
than
fingerprints.
in
fact,
they
did
a
lot
worse
in
the
national
academy
report
issued
last
week.
i
do
think,
however
--
and
i
would
hope
that
the
day
comes
that
will
be
more
truth
machines
like
dna,
which
will
make
it
easier
for
factfinders
to
have
dispositive
evidence
of
guilt
or
innocence.
but
right
now,
there's
only
one
test
that
caused
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
appropriate
billions
of
dollars
for
testing,
that
caused
congress
to
create
a
special
statute
saying,
we
don't
even
want
this
in
habeas;
we
want
this
statute
to
be
very
special.
we'd
like
to
give
people--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--well,
first
of
all,
in
this
case,
that
didn't
happen.
the
record
is
very
clear
that
he
personally
requested
the
dna
testing,
and--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--and
the
prosecutor
also
forwent
the
dna
testing
because
they--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--i
don't
think
so,
if
you
--
if
you
couch
it
in
the
loosest
terms
that
justice
alito
did,
namely,
"gaming
the
system".
because
i
don't
believe
a
person
in
mr.
osborne's
position
could
ever
be
gaming
the
system.
and
let
me
explain
why
so--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--okay.
i
would
say,
yes,
in
much
the
same
way
that
the
innocence
protection
act
says
if
a
defendant
expressly
and
voluntarily
waives
on
the
record
a
right
to
that
dna
testing,
because
it
is
so
fundamental
because
it
goes
right
to
the
core
of
everything,
innocence
versus
guilt,
then
it
would
not
be
unreasonable
to
prohibit
him
from
having
the
dna
test.
but
that
was--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--what
i'm
saying
is
it
would
not
be
an
unconstitutional
restriction,
like
the
innocence
protection
act,
if
the
state
of
alaska
required
--
which
it
does
not
now
because
there
is
no
legislative
scheme,
but
in
the
future
required
--
that
the
--
a
defendant
who
doesn't
want
dna
testing
has
to
voluntarily
and
explicitly
waive
that
on
the
record.
that
--
the
voluntary
and
knowing
waiver
is
a
requirement
in
the
ipa,
and
if
--
and
if
alaska
did
something
like
that,
i
think
that
would
be
--
that
would
not
be
irrational.
however,
i
must
point
out
in
all
honesty
that
there
are
a
number
of
people
who
are
mentioned
in
the
exonerating
briefs
such
as
eduardo
velasquez
and
mr.
tomey,
whose
lawyers
did
just
that.
they
said,
for
strategic
reasons,
we
don't
want
the
dna
test.
and
then
--
boom
--
years
later
they
get
the
dna
test,
and
they
are
completely
exonerated.
so--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--why
would
it--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--let's
for
a
moment--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--justice
kennedy,
let's
for
a
moment
think
about
it
in
a
purely
logical
way.
if
someone
is
innocent
and
wants
to
have
a
dna
test
--
okay?
as
mr.
osborne
did,
they
will
do
what
they
can
to
try
and
get
that
dna
test.
if
they
get
the
dna
test
years
later,
they're
not
getting
a
new
hearing.
they
are
not
getting
a
vacatur;
they
are
not
getting
a
new
trial.
they
are
not
getting
any
of
the
other
things
that
this
court
often
is
worried
about.
all
they
are
getting
is
a
darned
test.
and
they
stay
in
prison
while
they
get
that
darned
test.
and
if
that
test
shows
that
they
actually
committed
the
crime
--
okay
--
if
it
shows
they
committed
the
crime,
then
they
get
nothing.
not
only
do
they
get
nothing,
they
get
punished.
they
get
punished
because
no
--
no
court
in
habeas
or
in
any
other
postconviction
relief
will
ever
think
about
them
again.
mr.
peter
neufeld
and,
in
fact,
the
parole
board
will--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--well,
the
reason
why
i
--
i
don't
believe
it
is
gaming
the
system
--
and
perhaps,
you
know,
you
can
help
me
with
this
--
is
if
he's
getting
the
test
now
and
he
doesn't
get
out
of
prison
while
he's
having
the
test
and
he's
actually
using
his
own
money
to
pay
for
the
test,
and
if
the
test
shows
he's
guilty,
the
parole
board
is
going
to
turn
him
down.
he
can't
go
back
into
any
other
courts
asking
for
any
other
remedies.
so
he
is
in
a
much
worse
position.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
proves
he's
innocent,
then
he's
out.
so
how
does
that
game
the
system?
mr.
peter
neufeld
well
--
well,
why--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--in
all
practice,
it
is
a
moot
point.
because
this
is
a
transitional
right
for
a
very
small
group
of
people
who
were
tried
during
the
1980s
and
early
1990s.
mr.
peter
neufeld
no.
he
would
--
he
would
qualify.
mr.
peter
neufeld
all
he
would
have
to
do
is
--
is
go
back
and
actually
swear
out
a
declaration
under
penalty
of
perjury--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--well,
he's
never
been
required
to
do
that
or
asked
to
do
that.
mr.
peter
neufeld
other
than
--
other
than
that,
he
meets
every
single
other
criterion.
mr.
peter
neufeld
oh,
not
at
--
not
at
all,
sir.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
he
was
on
notice
that
that
was
required
as
part
of
the
procedure
in
alaska,
then
no
doubt
he
would
sign
that
affidavit
even
under
penalty
of
perjury.
the
problem
is
that
it's
not
a
requirement
of
1983,
and
there
was
no
legislative
scheme.
i
assure
--
you
know--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--your
honor
----
[laughter]
mr.
peter
neufeld
well,
first
of
all,
each
and
every
time
with
his
own
counsel,
justice
scalia,
he
was
adamant
about
asserting
his
innocence.
you
have
to
appreciate
that
at
this
point
in
time,
when
there's
a
discussion
about,
you
know,
what
a
prize
--
and
it
is
our
position
that
this
action
ends,
if
you
will,
okay,
if
the
court
grants
him
access
to
the
evidence
under
1983.
and
as
was
pointed
out
earlier
during
the
argument
of
my
adversary,
there
is
a
possibility
that
--
that
the
testing
--
because,
look,
i
wasn't
at
the
--
at
the
commission
of
the
crime.
i
don't
have
a
videotape
in
my
head.
i'm
trying
to
be
as
honest
and
forthright
with
you
as
i
possibly
can.
mr.
peter
neufeld
i
--
well,
you
know,
given
what
i
now
know
about--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--i
don't
think
so.
given
what
i
now
know
about
photo
shop,
i
don't
have
----
[laughter]
--i
don't
necessarily
hold
out
that
much
reliability
for
that
either,
justice
roberts.
mr.
peter
neufeld
under
the
constitution
there
is
no
duty
under
current
law
to
preserve
the
evidence.
we--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
--
however,
with
one
caveat.
and
the
one
caveat
is
it
is
a
different
situation
if
a
person
like
mr.
osborne
or
somebody
else
specifically
says,
i
want
to
do
dna
testing
in
this
case,
files
whatever
appropriate
procedure
in
whatever
court
to
commence
that
action,
and
then,
and
only
then,
the
other
side
goes
out
and
destroys
the
res
that
is
the
subject
of
that
litigation.
at
that
point
i
think
that
would
be
in
bad
faith.
mr.
peter
neufeld
no
--
no
objection.
but
on
a
practical
level
again,
what
we're
seeing
is
that
states
all
over
the
country
want
to
preserve
this
evidence,
not
just
for
the
wrongful
conviction
cases
but
also
to
enable
detectives
who
are
working
cold
cases
to
have
access
to
evidence.
and
if
the
evidence
isn't
there
any
more,
they
can't
work
them.
so
we're
seeing
a
movement
across
the
country
now
to
preserve
that
evidence.
mr.
peter
neufeld
certainly.
mr.
peter
neufeld
i
believe
he
is
in
custody--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--well,
i
--
i
think
what
happened
is
--
and
i
--
and
i
--
i
can't
swear
to
this
--
is
--
is
he
was
--
he
got
a
conditional
release
on
the
other
matter.
and
then
the
conditional
release
was
violated
as
well.
mr.
peter
neufeld
that's
right.
mr.
peter
neufeld
he's
--
he's
not,
but
i
don't
think
that
would
make
a
difference
in
the
outcome.
certainly,
if
a
person
had
a
death
warrant
in
one
state
and
then
they
were
charged
in
another
state,
they
would
still
have
a
liberty
interest
in
the
outcome
of
that
other
case.
mr.
peter
neufeld
i
--
i
believe
he
--
he
was
released
on
what's
called
conditional
release.
mr.
peter
neufeld
well,
under
alaska
law
one
of
the
key
requirements
to
get
parole
is
that
you
accept
responsibility
for
the
crime.
and
so
without
a
certain--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--i
would
hope,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
i
would
be
principled
enough
that
if
i
was
actually
innocent
and
they
told
me
that
the
only
way
i
could
get
out
was
to
say
i
committed
a
crime,
that
i
might
say:
"forget
it.
"
"i'll
spend
the
next
thirty
years
in
prison.
"
but
i
can
certainly
understand--
mr.
peter
neufeld
--yes.
mr.
peter
neufeld
i
believe
he
has
been
--
he's
back
in,
though,
i
think,
because
of
the
conditional
release.
it's
been
violated.
one
second.
he
had
a
parole
--
i'm
--
i'm
told
that
he
had
a
parole
revocation
hearing
on
the
other
case
and
that
he
was
given
six
more
years
to
serve
on
the
--
on
the
underlying
case
which
is
the
core
of
this
oral
argument.
mr.
peter
neufeld
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
peter
neufeld
thank
you
very
much.
