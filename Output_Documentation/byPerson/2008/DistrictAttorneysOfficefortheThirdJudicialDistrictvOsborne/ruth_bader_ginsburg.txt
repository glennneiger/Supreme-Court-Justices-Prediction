justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
perhaps
we
should
let
the
--
let
osborne,
osborne's
attorney,
address
that
question,
because
you're
not
really
equipped
to
answer
for
the
other
side.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
--
there
was
evidence
in
--
at
his
trial
at
the
state
of
the
art
at
that
time.
there
was
whatever
the
test
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
--
but
when
did
the
current
technology
become
available?
when
did
the
test
--
testing
that
he
now
requests--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--would
you
explain
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--just
to
clarify
his
statement,
he
said
that
the
state
of
alaska
provides
a
means
for
him
to
get
at
this
information;
but
if
it
did,
i
think
we
wouldn't
be
here.
so
would
you
--
alaska
is
one
of
the
few
states
that
has
no
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
--
you
say
--
i
mean,
this
whole
controversy
is
whether
the
state
is
obliged
to
give
him
this
information;
but
you're
saying
it's
simply
that
he
picked
the
wrong
procedure.
that's
what
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
just
now;
that
there
is
a
means
under
alaska
law
where
he
could
get
this
dna
postconviction.
so
would
you
please
explain
what
the
alaska
procedure
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
there
been
any
case
in
alaska
where
a
defendant
postconviction
was,
in
fact,
able
to
get
dna
testing
under
the
procedure
you
just
described?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
something
significant.
that
--
you
said
that
he
would
have
to
allege
his
actual
innocence,
which
he
hasn't
done.
so
if
he
continues
not
to
--
not
to
put
in
a
sworn
statement
that,
i
am
actually
innocent,
under
your
current
procedure
he
still
couldn't
get
the
dna.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
gave
the
one
case
in
which
in
the
habeas
in
alaska
the
court
granted
access
to
dna,
but
the
evidence
wasn't
there.
on
how
many
occasions
when
postconviction
someone
moved
for
the
dna
evidence
did
the
alaska
courts
deny
the
request?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
told
us
it
was
granted
in
one
case.
what
happened
in
the
other
six?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
--
what
were
the
two
confessions?
i
know
the
one
before
the
parole
authorities.
what
was
the
other
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
oath?
under
oath
so
that
he
would
be
subject
to
penalty
for
perjury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we
can
ask
your
opposite,
opposing
counsel.
we
can
put
it
to
him
point
blank.
that's
what
i
thought
he
said,
and
we
--
we
certainly
will
clarify
that.
but
there's
another
possible
impediment
here
to
your
claim.
if
we
assume
that
there
is
this
constitutional
right,
and
it's
available
in
1983,
this
trial
was
in
1993.
he
brings
the
1983
action
in
2003.
counsel
told
us
that
this
better
method
of
testing
has
been
available
since
the
late
nineties.
with
any
constitutional
right,
there's
an
obligation
of
due
diligence
on
the
part
of
the
claimant.
you
can't
come
in
10
years
later,
for
example,
and
say
--
say
there
was
a
tainted
juror
or
something
like
that.
it
was
--
it
--
when
you're
claiming
even
evidence
that
wasn't
available
at
the
trial,
you
have
to
make
the
application
with
due
diligence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
--
you
referred
to
the
civil
rules,
and
in
discovery,
in
criminal
cases
as
in
civil
cases,
it
--
ordinarily
you
have
to
prove
that
you
have
a
basis
for
a
claim.
like
you
don't
get
on
the
civil
side
discovery
before
you
can
pass
the
12(b)(6)
threshold
that
you
have
stated
a
claim.
are
you
giving
that
up
here?
because
he's
seeking
the
discovery
but
he
hasn't
established
that
he
has
a
tenable
claim.
