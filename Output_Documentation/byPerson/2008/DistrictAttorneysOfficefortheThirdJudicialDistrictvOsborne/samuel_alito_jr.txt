justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
was
the
reason
that
--
that
respondent's
counsel
provided
for
not
requesting
that
test?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
is
some
constitutional
right
to
obtain
dna
evidence
for
testing
postconviction.
would
you
still
--
would
you
say
that
that
right
includes
the
situation
where,
a,
the
prisoner
refuses
to
assert
under
penalty
of
perjury
that
he
or
she
is
actually
innocent;
and
applies,
even
if
there
was
a
tactical
decision
at
trial
not
to
seek
dna
testing
at
all
or
not
to
seek
the
most
reliable
form
of
dna
testing
that
was
available
at
the
time?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
think
that
--
you
think
that's
a
novel
idea
that
never
occurred
to
him?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
for
--
sorry.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
can
this
constitutional
right
be
limited
just
to
dna
evidence?
i
presume
that
there
are
--
there
may
be
other
scientific
advances
in
the
testing
of
physical
evidence,
and
if
that
happens,
why
wouldn't
the
right
apply
to
those
as
well?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
advances
in
--
advances
in
detecting
fingerprints
or
testing
fibers
or
all
sorts
of
other
things.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
the
second
part
of
the
question
i
asked
at
the
start,
which
you
never
really
got
a
chance
to
answer.
would
it
be
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
say
that
a
--
a
prisoner
can
get
postconviction
access
to
dna
evidence,
but
not
where
it
appears
that
the
prisoner
is
gaming
the
system?
not
where
the
prisoner
declined
at
trial
to
ask
for
dna
testing
for
a
tactical
reason
because
there
was
a
chance
that
the
dna
evidence
would
be
inculpatory?
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
