mr.
neal
k.
katyal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
created
a
novel
constitutional
right
by
extending
brady
to
the
postconviction
setting.
mr.
osborne
doesn't
attempt
to
defend
that
rationale.
instead,
he
attempts
to
mint
a
previously
unrecognized
liberty
interest
in
access
to
clemency
or
state
postconviction
procedures.
assuming
the
court
reaches
the
second
question
presented,
it
should
not
constitutionalize
rules
for
postconviction
access
to
dna,
an
area
of
great
legislative
ferment
in
just
the
last
few
years.
and
even
were
it
inclined
to
do
so,
the
unusual
facts
of
this
case,
which
include
failure
to
attest
to
actual
innocence
under
threat
of
perjury,
two
recent
confessions
to
the
crime,
and
a
tactical
decision
at
trial
to
forego
a
highly
discriminating
rflp
dna
test,
all
together
make
this
a
particularly
poor
candidate
for
recognizing
a
new
constitutional
entitlement.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
there
are
two
confessions
to
the
parole
authorities.
one
is
found
at
page
--
petition
appendix
71a.
there's
a
small
reprint
which
is
the
written
portion
of
the
--
of
the
confession.
there's
also
separately
in
the
record
--
this
is
at
supplemental
excerpts
of
the
record,
pages
248
to
61,
in
the
ninth
circuit,
which--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
well,
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
we
have
had
any
situation
like
this,
in
which
you
have
had
so
many
different
facts
all
together
that
--
that
suggested
both
that
he
--
that
he's
guilty
and
that
--
and
you
are
talking
about
a
confession
that's
taking
place
years
after.
i
think
the
cases
that
are
referred
to
by
the
amici
are
situations
in
which
someone
has
confessed
generally
at
trial
or
something
like
that.
here
you
have
two
confessions
years
later.
they
are
very
detailed.
the
one
in
the
--
in
the
supplemental
excerpts
to
the
record
is
a
very
long
story,
and
he
says
that
he
told
his
attorney
about
it
and
talks
all
about
how
he
had
confessed
to
his
mother,
how
it
was
very
difficult
to
exorcise.
it
is
a
very
in-depth
confession,
and
it
is
a
confession
that
the
--
that
the
alaska
courts
have
credited.
it
is
not
just
our
word.
at
joint
appendix
page
221,
the
alaska
court
found
--
listened
to
that
2004
confession
in
light
of
the
2006
affidavit
that
mr.
--
mr.
osborne
makes
much
of,
claiming
that
he
is
innocent,
and
put
those
two
documents
side
by
side
and
said,
taken
together,
they
don't
--
the
2006
affidavit
does
not
really
take--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--the
--
the
state
has
so
agreed.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
well,
it
is
--
it
is
not
clear
to
me
under
state
law.
i
think
as
i
understood
my
friend
--
but
that's
what
i
understood
him
to
say.
i
can
tell
you,
for
--
justice
breyer,
for
purposes
of
the
federal
law,
it's
18
usc
3600,
has
this
requirement
in
it
which
says
that
in
order
to
get
dna
testing
you
must
attest
under
threat
of
perjury
that
you
are
actually
innocent.
there
is
a
very
serious
requirement,
done
after
years
of
congressional
debate.
that
is
something
that
the
ninth
circuit
rule
would
disregard,
and
it
would
permit
someone
to
come
in
without
that--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--our
position,
justice
scalia,
is
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
dna,
but
if
--
were
the
court
inclined
to
find
one
and
locate
it
somewhere
in
brady
or
the
procedural
due
process
clause,
something
we
think
which
would
be
very
difficult
to
do,
but
were
it
--
if
that
were
the
court's
inclination,
absolutely,
it
should
at
least
mirror
the
federal
statute
and
the
--
and
the
rock
solid
requirements
of
3600,
which
do
require
that
perjury
--
that
perjury
statement
to
be
made
in
order
to--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--well,
this
court
has
struggled
with
that
and
so
far
has
said
no.
and
the
latest
decision
is
herrera
v.
collins.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
our
position
is
that
the
logic
of
this
court's
precedents
is
that
there
is
no
right
at
present
to
actual
innocence.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
the
united
states
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
have
an
interest
as
a
--
would
--
would
generally
permit
as
a
matter
of
prosecutorial
ethics
access
to
--
if
the
united
states
knew
that
there
was
some
exculpatory
material
that
it
had
within
its
purview,
it
would
turn
that
over.
it
just
wouldn't
be
a
constitutional--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--well,
i
think
that
it
would
--
it
would
have
to
--
if
it
adopted
such
a
rule
and
allowed
the
talking
in
any
situation--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--well,
let
me
talk
about
dna,
for
example.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
let
me
talk
about
dna.
the
reason
why
with
respect
to
dna
is
it's
a
no-cost
proposition
for
a
defendant
to
say:
hey,
i'm
innocent,
i
want
to
get
tested--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--so
that's
why--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--well,
the
--
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
hypothetical
and
whether
or
not
there's
some
--
whether
or
not
it
would
open
up
the
floodgates,
i
guess,
to
other
requests
and
so
on.
with
respect
to
dna,
there
is--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--it's
possible,
because
there
is
--
it
may
be
that
as
a
policy
matter
they
will
allow
it,
but
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
justice
souter,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--again,
there
may
be
because
of
floodgates
or
other
reasons.
but
for
the--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--seven
thus
far,
justice
stevens.
if
this
court
were
to
recognize
a
constitutional
right
to
dna--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--for
all
50
states,
there
would
really
be,
i
think,
quite
a
dramatically
different
result.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
precisely.
and
so
we're
talking
about
seven
in
one
state
right
now,
but
i
think
the
numbers
could
be
great,
and
that
was
what
congress
said
when
they
passed
3600,
which
said
there
has
to
be
something
to
lose
on
the
stake
of
defendants,
so
that
they
can't
come
in,
like
mr.
osborne,
and
have
questionable
statements
as
to
whether
they're
actually
innocent
or
not.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
because,
justice
breyer,
that's
not
the
way
this
court
approaches
due
process
questions.
were
it,
for
example,
non-unanimous
jury
verdicts,
which
two
states
have,
would
be
impermissible.
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
but
you
enter
the
thicket
of
practical
problems,
it
seems
to
me,
justice
breyer,
when
you
do
that,
because
the
44
states
that
have
these
statutes
do
it
in
a
variety
of
different
ways
with
respect
to
perjury
requirements,
felonies
versus
misdemeanors,
who
gets
access,
who
pays
for
it,
do
they
get
lawyers.
there's
a
host
of
policy
questions
that
arise--
mr.
neal
k.
katyal
--were
that
the
case,
then
alaska
itself
would
be
within
that
framework,
because
it
already
has
a
process
in
place.
thank
you.
