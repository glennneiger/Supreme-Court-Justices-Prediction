mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
alaska
fully
recognizes
the
importance
of
dna
evidence.
the
state
provides
criminal
defendants
with
pretrial
access
to
that
evidence,
and
it
has
postconviction
procedures
that
give
prisoners
a
fair
opportunity
to
retest
that
evidence
should
new
technology
become
available.
so
this
case
really
isn't
about
the
importance
or
power
of
dna
evidence.
rather
it's
about
three
things:
first,
it's
about
the
proper
procedural
device
for
asserting
in
federal
court
a
right
to
postconviction
testing.
section
1983
is
not
the
correct
device
because
mr.
osborne's
claim
clearly
sounds
in
federal
habeas
corpus.
the
evidence
he
seeks
has
a
singular
relevance
to
support
a
direct
attack
on
the
validity
of
his
confinement.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
well,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
osborne's
case
is
comparable
to
balisok
v.
edwards,
where
the
petitioner
was
seeking
damages
for
--
as
a
result
of
a
biased
hearing
in
prison.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it's
not
seeking
damages,
but
the
proof
--
the
difference
between
this
case
--
the
only
difference
between
this
case
and
balisok
is
that
in
this
case
the
proof
is
going
to
be
happening
in
a
laboratory;
whereas,
in
balisok
the--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--but
this
--
his
request
is
--
is
simply
a
discovery
request.
he's
--
he's
split
his
--
his
claim
away
from
his
underlying
claim
of
actual
innocence,
his--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--but
he
--
to
assert
a
claim
of
actual
innocence,
he
doesn't
need
to
have
the
result
of
a
dna
test,
and--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--but
the
--
this
evidence
has
a
singular
relevance,
and
his
--
his
true
intent
is
to
--
is
to
assert--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--a
claim
of
innocence.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
what
this
represents,
what
his
request
represents,
is
a
discovery
request.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
well,
the
--
the
state
does
have
an
interest
in
--
in
insisting
that
mr.
osborne
follow
the
established
procedures.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
well,
he
hasn't
--
he
has
never
really
asserted
that
he
is
actually
innocent.
he
holds
out
the
possibility,
and
he's
filed
an
affidavit
which
is
at
joint
appendix--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--he
--
he
has
hedged,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
well,
as
this
case
started,
your
honor,
mr.
osborne
was
asserting
that
it
would
establish
his
--
his
innocence.
but
yet
he
has
never
--
he
has
never
made
a
declaration
under
penalty
of
perjury
that
he
is
innocent.
so,
your
--
your
honor,
you're
correct.
he
seems
to
be,
for
lack
of
a
better
word,
fishing
for
evidence
that
--
that
might
help
him.
and--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--justice
ginsburg,
at
trial
the
state
performed
what
is
known
as
dq
alpha
testing.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
that's
my
understanding,
that
the
rflp
testing
was
a
much
more
discriminating
type
of
--
would
yield
a
much
more
discriminating
result
than
the
dq
alpha.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
i'm
not
certain
about
that,
your
honor.
my
--
i
would
guess
that
it
was
around
the
late
nineties.
it
was
available
before
he
filed
his
--
this
federal
action.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
i
can't
answer
whether
the
state
has
a
policy.
it
seems
to
be
a
decision
that
is
made
jointly
with
the
police,
the
--
the
crime
lab,
and
the
prosecutors,
and
it
depends,
i
would
--
i
would
think,
on
the
status
of
the
case
as
it
--
as
it
proceeds
after
conviction
through
direct
appeal.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
justice
breyer,
the
state
doesn't
have
an
obligation
to
provide
this
evidence
to
him
because
there
is
no
--
a
--
prisoners
have
no
federal
right
to
postconviction
relief,
and
the
state
of
alaska
has
provided
procedures
by
which
--
which
mr.
osborne
if
he
chose
to
use
them
could
make
available
the
evidence
that
he
seeks.
but
he
hasn't
chosen
to
invoke
those
procedures.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
alaska
has
a
postconviction
relief
statute
and
that
is
at
page
--
starts
at
page
10a
of
the
blue
brief.
and
under
that
statute,
a
prisoner
can
assert
a
claim
for
--
for
postconviction
relief
when
there
exist
material
facts
--
i'm
quoting
from
alaska
statute
12.72.010.
for
--
postconviction
relief
is
there
available
when
a
person
claims
that
there
exists
evidence
of
material
facts
not
previously
presented
and
heard
by
the
court
that
requires
vacation
of
the
conviction
or
sentence
in
the
interest
of
justice.
now,
if
you
--
if
mr.
osborne
were
to
state
a
cognizable
claim
under
that
statute,
the
alaska
rules
of
court
then
apply
the
full
civil
rules
pertaining
to
discovery
as
a
right
to
the
applicant.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
well,
your
honor,
there's
--
there
was
one
case
and
it's
cited
in
the
yellow
brief,
patterson
v.
state,
that
a
prisoner
did
apply
in
court
and
was
granted
access
to
the
dna
evidence,
but
then
it
came
to
pass
that
the
evidence
had
been
destroyed
by
--
by
that
time.
so
in
that
case
the
relief
was
granted,
but
through
the
destruction
of
the
evidence
the
--
no
testing
was
possible.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
i
believe--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--less
--
we
did
an
informal
search
and
found
seven
cases
where
there
were
actual
requests;
and
i
--
i
believe
that
five
of
them
involved
court
cases,
the
one
that
i
have
just
mentioned
where
the
relief
was
granted,
and
i
believe
the
remaining
are
pending
decision.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
well--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--that's
--
prisoners
have
never
been
able
to
postconviction
simply
seek
over
the
counter
the
evidence
that
--
that
was
used
in
their
earlier
--
in
their--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--but
justice
souter--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--that--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
but,
but
--
but
only
mr.
osborne
knows
whether
he
is
innocent.
and
if
he
is
innocent--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--if--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
but
if
he
is
innocent,
then
he
does
know
the
--
the
result
of
the
testing.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
well,
i
think
actually,
your
honor,
it
did
not,
because
in
that
case
he
never
asserted
his
innocence.
that
was
a
request
he
made
on
reconsideration
after
the
denial
of
his
ineffective
assistance
claim.
and
he
said
that
under
the
due
--
under
due
process,
i
am
entitled
to
have
this
evidence
so
that
i
can
present
an
actual
innocence
claim.
so
the
case
that
you
are
referring
to
is--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--well,
in
--
in
mr.
osborne's
first
postconviction
relief
case
that
was
decided
in
--
are
you
talking
about
the--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--oh,
okay.
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
right.
you're--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--because,
your
honor,
the
state
of
alaska
has
a
procedure
that
was
not
invoked
in
the--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--because,
your
honor,
the
state
of
alaska
has
a
procedure
that
would
enable
him
to
obtain
that
evidence.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
with
respect,
your
honor,
that
was
the
test
they
applied
in
that
case,
but
that
is
not
the
test
that
would
apply
if
mr.
osborne
were
to
file
a
new
postconviction
relief
application
asserting
that
he
is
actually
innocent.
if
he
were
to
do
that,
then
the
full
civil
rules
of
discovery
would
available
to
him.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
pardon
me.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
right.
but
alaska
--
alaska
has
procedures
for
this.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
if
he
doesn't
allege
his
actual
innocence,
your
honor,
then
this
is
really
an
empty
exercise,
a
fishing
expedition.
he
wants
to
just
see
what
--
what
the
evidence
says.
and
that
--
that
is
not
the
way
litigation
works.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
my
--
my
--
there
were
--
as
i
said,
there
were
seven
cases;
and
my
understanding
is
there
have
--
has
not
been
a
denial.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
there
--
well--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--there
were
--
there
are
four
or
five
that
are
pending.
one
of
them
is
mr.
osborne's
case,
and
another
is
being
reviewed
by
the
--
by
the
attorney
general.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
three
minutes,
your
honor?
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
if
he
were
to
file
a
new
application
for
postconviction
relief
with
an
affidavit
that
the
civil
rules
of
discovery
would
apply,
and
he,
i
believe,
would
be
--
be
able
to
obtain
the
evidence
that
he
seeks.
however--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--well,
there
are
--
there
are
possibilities
of
procedural
default.
but
--
and
that
would
be
for
the
court--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--i
--
yes.
i
--
i
believe
i
could.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
as
i
say--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--i'm--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--that's
true,
your
honor.
and
--
and
that
was--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--well--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--well,
before
you
reach
the
discovery
issues
there
would
be
the
issues
of
procedural
default.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
once
those
were
cleared
away
then
he
would
be
able
to--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--not
that
he
would
--
that's
correct.
not
that
he
will
definitely
get
that.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
i
want
to
clear
up--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--justice
ginsburg,
mr.
osborne,
by
filing
an
affidavit
that
would
accompany
his
application,
that
would
--
i
think
that
would
operate
to
state
a
claim.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
that
--
that's
conceivable,
your
honor;
but
in
--
in
mr.
osborne's
case,
he's
had
14
years
to
step
forward
and
declare
his
innocence,
as
any
truly
innocent--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--yes,
your
honor.
it
--
it
is.
because
i
don't
think
that
the
mere
existence
of
the
possibility
that
dna
could
exonerate
is
necessarily
sufficient
--
a
sufficient
basis
to
then
do
the
testing.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
i
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
--
your
question,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
the--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--if
he
--
if
he
were
to
do
as
you
say,
then
with
respect
to
a
--
the
request
for
discovery,
i
believe
that
our
only
defense
would
be
the
procedural
defense
of
--
you
know
--
lack
of
due
diligence
or
--
or
something
along
--
or
untimely--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--pardon
me?
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
i
--
i
can't
say
that
we
would
actually
do
that,
but
we
certainly
have
the
--
the
right
to
do
that.
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
proceeding--
mr.
kenneth
m.
rosenstein
--thank
you.
