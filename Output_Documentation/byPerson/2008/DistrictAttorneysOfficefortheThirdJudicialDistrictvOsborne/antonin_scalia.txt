justice
antonin
scalia
would
the
other
side
concede
the
premise
that
he
doesn't
say
that
this
is
going
to
exonerate
him?
that
he
has
--
you
know
--
here's
some
--
some
evidence
out
there.
it
may
help
me;
it
may
hurt
me.
i
don't
know
which,
but
i
--
i'd
like
to
see
it.
is
--
is
that
the
only
claim
he's
making?
if
so,
it's
--
it's
a
lot
less
--
what
should
i
say
--
a
lot
less
plausible
a
constitutional
claim.
there's
some
evidence
that
i'd
like
to
look
at;
i'm
not
saying
it
will
prove
me
innocent.
i'd
just
like
to
look
at
this
evidence.
might,
might
not.
that's
a
lot
weaker
claim
than
what
i
had
thought
he
was
making,
which
is
--
is
the
claim
that
this
--
this
new
scientific
evidence
will
--
will
prove
my
innocence.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
which
is
he
doing
here?
is
--
is
he
saying
the
latter
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
it's
not
a
constitutional
claim
of
entitlement
to
evidence
which
he
asserts
will
prove
his
innocence,
but
rather
a
constitutional
claim
to
evidence
which
might
or
then
might
not
prove
his
innocence?
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
we
were
--
we're
assuming
the
premise,
though,
in
--
in
the
questioning.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
was
not
the
state
of
the
art
at
the
time,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
ask
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
that
--
that
relief
would
--
would
require
him
to
assert
his
innocence,
wouldn't
it?
he
would
have
to
bring
a
habeas
corpus
action
claiming
that
the
state
has
no
business
holding
him
because
in
fact
he's
innocent?
he
doesn't
want
to
do
that;
he
just
wants
to
say,
you
know,
i'd
just
like
to
see
this
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
help
me.
it
might
not
help
me,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
thought
you
said
the
state
has
--
has
indeed
granted
a
habeas
request.
in
that
case,
where
it
granted
the
habeas
request,
although
it
turned
out
that
the
evidence
was
destroyed,
in
that
case,
surely
the
same
situation
--
the
same
situation
existed.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
the
case
you
are
referring
to.
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
make
it
up.
you
did.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i'm
talking
about
the
case
you
alluded
to
earlier,
where
you
say
the
state
of
alaska
had
indeed
provided
dna
evidence
or
had
agreed
to
provide
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
for
the
fact
that
it
no
longer
existed.
now,
in
that
case
surely
the
same
problem
existed
that
justice
souter
is
--
is
raising.
that
--
that
person
also,
while
claiming
innocence,
couldn't
say
for
sure
what
the
evidence
would
produce,
but
that
didn't
stop
the
--
the
state
from
providing
it;
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
they
were
still
pending.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
we
could
attach
that
to
the
new
constitutional
right
that
we
invent?
it
would
be
a
constitutional
right
to
get
it
if
--
if
--
but
if
you
lose,
you
get
another
three
years?
could
we
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
especially,
i
would
assume,
one
constitutional
right
in
which
you
do
not
even
have
to
assert
your
innocence.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
apparently
he
had
told
her
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
accept
that
--
of
course
it
does;
and
this
is
not
a
new
procedure.
i
--
i
didn't
understand
it
to
be
a
new
procedure,
as
justice
breyer
has
described
it.
it
is
the
procedure
of
habeas
corpus.
they
have
a
procedure
for
habeas
corpus
which
includes
discovery,
and
all
he
has
to
do
is
come
in
and
say,
you
know,
i
have
been
wrongfully
convicted;
i
am
innocent;
and
i
want
to
--
i
want
to
discover
this
evidence
in
order
to
establish
it,
so
that
i
can
get
out
of
jail.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
it
is
very
strange.
why
did
they
do
that,
i
wonder?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
a
lot
of
other
evidence
in
the
case,
wasn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
they
thought
they
were
doing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
will
see
cases
where
the
defendant
maintained
that
the
defendant
was
innocent.
now,
whether
this
was
a
requirement
imposed
by
alaska
or
not,
it
seems
to
me
you
cannot
point
to
the
practice
of
the
other
states
and
say
alaska
must
have
the
same
practice
--
when,
in
fact,
you
don't
comply
with
the
practices
of
the
other
states.
almost
all
of
them
do
require
an
assertion
of
innocence,
which
--
which
your
client
has
not
made.
i
--
i
cannot
imagine
how
you
can
simply
--
oh,
look
at
all
these
other
--
44
other
states,
when
your
client
does
not
meet
the
requirements
that
those
states
would
impose.
justice
antonin
scalia
his
counsel
--
his
counsel
forwent
the
dna
testing,
and
we
attribute
the
actions
of
counsel
to
the
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
will--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
they
will
have
acquired
the
advantage
of
having
a
chance
of
the
jury's
acquitting
them
at
the
trial.
because
by
not
asking
for
the
dna
testing,
there
was
a
chance
the
jury
might
let
them
off.
had
they
asked
for
it
then,
and
had
it
shown
conclusively,
the
game
was
over.
so
it
is
gaming
the
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
ex
ante.
we're
--
we're
looking
at
it
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
does
it
pay
for
the
defendant
to
ask
for
a
dna
test?
well,
of
course,
it
doesn't.
because
if
he
asks
for
it
and
it
--
it
finds
that
he's
guilty,
that's
the
end
of
it.
there
is
no
chance
of
the
jury
acquitting
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
not
just
not
ask
for
it
and
if
it
turns
out
that
the
jury
happens
to
convict
him
anyway,
then
ask
for
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
biggie,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
quite
dubious
that
--
that
he
would
indeed
sign
it.
i
--
i
was
really
struck
by
his
affidavit
in
this
case,
number
--
paragraph
9
of
which
says:
"i
have
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
retesting
of
the
condom
will
prove
once
and
for
all
time.
"
--and
one
expects
to
follow
--
my
innocence.
that's
not
what
it
says.
"will
prove
once
and
for
all
time
either
my
guilt
or
innocence.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
what
is
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
would
still
want
to
leave
yourself
open
to
make
the
objection
that
he
had
a
chance
to
get
this
at
trial
and
--
and
--
and
decided
not
to
get
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
those
objections
continue
to
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
all
--
all
that
you
have
to
concede
is
that
there
is
some
means
for
him
to
get
into
court,
with
those
--
those
exceptions
that
other
states
make;
and
other
states
do
make
an
exception
for
gaming
the
system.
so,
so
long
as
he
can
get
in
in
habeas
corpus
it
seems
to
me
you
can
very
well
leave
for
later
whether
you
are
going
to
concede
that
even
though
--
even
though
he
didn't
ask
for
it
at
trial,
he
can
get
it
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
give
it
away?
justice
antonin
scalia
--any
more
than
you
gave
away
the
fact
that
this
is
going
to
is
going
to
prove
his
innocence--
