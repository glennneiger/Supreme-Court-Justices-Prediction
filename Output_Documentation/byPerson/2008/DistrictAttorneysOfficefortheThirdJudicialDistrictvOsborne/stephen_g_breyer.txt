justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
now?
as
far
as
i
understand,
there's
a
procedural
problem.
i
tried
to
figure
out
the
heck
line
once
in
balisok.
my
impression
of
it
is
that
if,
mr.
prisoner,
you're
bringing
an
action
challenging
some
confinement,
or
the
effect
of
your
action
is
going
to
be
to
let
you
go
out
of
solitary
or
out
of
prison,
then
proceed
your
habeas.
but
if
what
you're
trying
to
get
is
relief
that
may
or
may
not
mean
you
get
out
of
solitary
or
you
get
out
of
prison,
then
you
go
to
1983.
but,
by
the
way,
if
you're
in
1983
you
are
complaining
about
an
action
or
inaction
by
a
state
official
that
violates
a
constitutional
right.
now,
as
i
look
at
this
case,
the
prisoner,
if
he
wins,
is
not
going
to
get
out,
and
he
is
complaining
about
the
state
violating
a
constitutional
right
by
refusing
to
give
him
dna.
it
seems
to
me
that
second
question
is
the
question
that's
the
heart
of
the
case:
does
the
state
have
a
constitutional
obligation
to
give
him
the
dna?
so
i
would
appreciate
your
telling
me
why
it
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
if,
in
fact
--
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
your
time
is
up,
but
i
really
have
only
one
question
this
morning
and
i
would
like
to
have
a
chance
to
ask
it,
and
i
am
trying
to
clear
away
some
undergrowth.
and
the
undergrowth
first
i
have
cleared
away
in
my
mind
is
this
heck
question.
the
second
is
the
alaska
court
decision.
and
my
impression
is
that
alaska
refused
the
test
because,
among
other
things,
they
couldn't
say
--
they
said
the
conviction
rested
primarily
on
eyewitness
testimony,
and
they
have
a
bunch
of
reasons.
but
the
ninth
circuit,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
tried
to
blow
apart
those
reasons.
okay?
suppose
i
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit.
then
my
question
is
this:
does
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
require
you
to
give
this
evidence
to
the
defendant?
and
one
of
the
relevant
points
in
my
mind
is
i
see
it
would
be
of
significant
advantage
to
the
defendant.
even
if
he's
guilty,
he
can
be
proved
to
--
whatever.
it
is
an
advantage
to
him.
now,
why
don't
you
want
to
give
it
to
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
i
--
there
i
--
that's
the
undergrowth
i
tried
to
clear
away.
i
am
saying
i
read
all
that
procedure.
suppose
i
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
right
about
that
procedure,
namely
that
the
tests
that
they're
using
in
that
procedure
are
not
favorable
enough
to
a
defendant
who
is
seeking,
as
this
defendant
is
seeking,
the
dna.
he
just
wants
some
dna.
he'll
pay
for
it.
the
odds
are
eight
to
one
he's
going
to
lose.
but
he
thinks:
i'm
willing
to
run
those
odds.
i
won't
put
you
at
any
trouble.
now,
why
don't
you
want
to
give
it
to
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
procedure
has
the
tests
in
it
that
the
alaska
court
--
didn't
the
alaska
supreme
court
say,
we
will
not
give
you
dna
evidence
unless
you
can
demonstrate,
one,
that
the
conviction
rested
primarily
on
eyewitness
id
evidence;
two,
that
there
was
a
demonstrable
doubt
concerning
his
id
as
the
perpetrator;
and,
three,
that
scientific
testing
would
likely
would
be
conclusive.
wasn't
that
their
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
--
a
different
--
then
they'd
give
it
to
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
all
he
has
to
do
is
file
a
new
piece
of
paper
tomorrow,
and
he
gets
the
dna?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
is
it
true
that
all
he
has
to
do
is
file
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
court
that
says:
whatever
i
said
before,
i
did
it
under
pressure;
i
am
innocent?
and
if
he
says
those
words,
dna?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
can't
you
do
this?
look
at
the
consensus
of
the
statutes
in
the
states
and
the
federal
government
and
say
there's
a
range
of
appreciation
here,
and
there
is
a
right
but
it
catches
only
the
outliers?
and
so
the
worst
that
would
happen
is
that
the
outlying
states
would
have
to
bring
themselves
into
conformity
with
the
outer
reaches
of
whatever
the
set
of
statutes
is
now
in
all
the
other
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
every
instance
in
which
there
are
outliers
is
unconstitutional.
i'm
just
saying
in
this
instance
for
other
reasons
it
might
be
unconstitutional;
namely,
you
have
a
good
way
of
proving
guilty
or
innocence,
and
if
that's
so,
the
practical
problem
is
not
great.
you
solve
the
practical
problem
in
the
way
i
just
mentioned.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
constitutional
right
is
bring
yourself
within
any
one
of
them,
unless
that
any
one
of
them
is
a
real
outlier,
which
you
can
make
as
an
argument
that
you
will
never
win.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
he
just
doesn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
this
case,
because
i
heard
opposing
counsel
say
if
you
go
tomorrow
and
file
a
piece
of
paper
and
swear
on
that
piece
of
paper
you're
innocent,
alaska
will
give
you
the
dna.
isn't
that
what
he
said?
i
heard
him
say
that,
i
thought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
he
said
it
in
this
court
in
answer
to
a
question,
i
don't
see
why
that
isn't
binding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
wait.
what
--
what
i
heard
was
that
if
your
client
files
a
piece
of
paper
that
says,
i
am
innocent,
then
under
this
new
procedure,
which
apparently
i
hadn't
read
about
because
i
didn't
find
it,
or
it
wasn't
obvious
in
the
brief,
that
then
they
will
give
him
the
dna.
now
that's
either
right
or
it's
wrong;
and
if
it's
right,
i
think
that's
the
end
of
it,
and
if
it's
wrong,
well,
then
we'll
have
to
proceed.
but
i
would
proceed
on
the
basis
that
this
swearing
requirement
is
not
sufficient.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
say
this
--
could
you
say,
suppose
--
i'm
just
testing
this
out
--
that
like
any
other
governmental
action,
this
action
of
refusing
the
dna
evidence
is
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment's
requirement
that
there
be
a
reasonable
basis?
can't
be
arbitrary.
now,
withholding
dna
is
a
governmental
action,
and
so
you
cannot
do
so
arbitrarily.
if
you
were
to
do
so
simply
because
the
defendant
would
not
sign
a
new
complaint
under
this
new
procedure,
which
i
somehow
missed
in
the
reply
brief,
that's
a
good
basis
for
withholding
it.
he
should
be
willing
to
do
that.
if
the
reason
they
won't
give
him
the
dna
is
because
before
the
parole
board
he
said
he
was
innocent
--
ha
!
that,
to
me
--
not
to
others,
but
to
me
--
that
would
mean
nothing.
of
course,
he's
going
to
say
he's
innocent.
he
doesn't
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
in
prison.
okay?
so,
i
--
i
would
say,
but
not
maybe
others
would
say,
that
if
that's
their
reason
for
not
giving
it,
i'd
hear
further
argument,
but
that
would
be
arbitrary.
but
if
their
reason
for
not
giving
it
is
just
because
he
won't
file
a
new
piece
of
paper
in
which
he
says
he's
innocent
where
there's
nothing
to
lose
there,
then
i
think
the
state's
being
arbitrary.
suppose
we
said
that:
the
rule
is
non-arbitrary,
with
illustrations,
send
it
back
to
the
states.
and
of
course
when
they
apply
their
own
statutes,
by
and
large
they're
not
being
arbitrary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
does
help
you
win.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
would
like
to
know
what
you
do--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
this
is
where
i
--
look.
he
files
a
new
piece
of
paper.
now,
if
you're
going
to
oppose
that,
on
the
ground
that
it
wasn't
procedurally
correct,
one;
on
the
ground,
two,
he
didn't
ask
for
this
dna
at
trial,
though
he
might
have;
met
with
the
charge,
what
was
at
issue
at
trial
is
something
very
different;
three,
that
he
wasn't
guilty
--
you
know,
too
much
evidence
against
him,
met
with
the
claim,
there
wasn't
much
evidence
against
him
--
okay,
we
have
the
case
in
front
of
us;
we'll
decide
it.
but
if
you're
prepared
to
concede,
"i'm
not
going
to
raise
those
things.
"
then
their
client
has
what
he
wants
--
the
dna.
so
which
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
just
repeat
it.
i
--
he
--
his
client
follows
your
procedure:
dna>
["].
now
will
you
give
it
to
him?
or
are
you
going
to
meet
him
with
the
same
defenses
that
you
raise
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wrong
procedure.
you
ask
--
you
could
have
gotten
it
at
trial,
which
he
says
isn't
true
--
and
there
was
too
much
evidence,
which
he
says
isn't
true.
okay?
so
what
are
we
going
to
have,
mr.
rosenstein?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
only
defense
is
procedure--
