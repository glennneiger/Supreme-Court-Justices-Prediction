justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
it
is
denied
by
--
by
the
state
court.
and
suppose
it's
denied
by
the
state
court
more
--
more
than
a
year
after
the
conclusion
of
the
original
proceeding.
what
--
what
is
the
consequence
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
he
institutes
it,
however,
within
the
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
assuming
that
he
files
the
appeal
within
one
year,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
he
doesn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
game
is
over.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
he
doesn't
find
out
about
the
fact
that
notice,
proper
notice,
wasn't
given
to
his
counsel,
so
he
doesn't
find
out
about
the
gravamen
for
the
appeal
until
after
a
year?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
(d)(
1)(b)
does.
it
requires
an
impediment
to
have
been
removed.
there
is
no
impediment
being
removed.
he
just
didn't
find
out
the
facts.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
made
one
up.
i
mean,
it's
a
hypothetical.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
more
of
a
problem
than
that,
as
the
other
side
just
said.
1(b),
which
is
the
gimmick
you
are
using
to
get
out
of
this,
doesn't
speak
of
not
being
able
to
find
out
in
time;
it
speaks
of
the
date
on
which
the
impediment
to
file
an
application--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
removed.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you
said
(d),
not
(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
with
1(d)
is
that
the
claim
or
claims
presented
that
is
referred
to
in
(d)
is
not
the
denial
of
the
appeal.
it's
the
claim
or
claims
that
he
wants
to
bring
in
his
federal
habeas.
that's
why
1(d)
doesn't
work,
you
have
to
go
back
to
1(b).
i'm
talking
to
you.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
your
fault.
justice
antonin
scalia
convicted
felons
don't
always
make
intelligent
decisions,
you
are
saying.
