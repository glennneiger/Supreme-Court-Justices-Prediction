justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
--
just
out
of
curiosity,
a
prisoner's
lawyer
doesn't
take
the
appeal,
the
time
expires,
bong,
the
year
begins
to
run.
within
that
year
he
files
federal
habeas.
then
he
discovers
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
state
appeal.
so
he
goes,
just
like
this
man,
goes
back
and,
sure
enough,
he
gets
his
direct
appeal,
and
three
years
later
or
a
year
later
they
finish
the
direct
appeal.
bong,
he
can
file
again.
is
that
his
first
habeas
or
his
second
habeas?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
doubt
that
one
--
i
mean,
one
may
never
arise
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
first
one
is
proper
and
on
your
view
so
is
the
second
one
proper.
so
they
are
both
proper,
and
there
are
two
of
them.
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
nobody
knows
about
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
nobody
knows
that
the
state
made
a
mistake
in
not
giving
him
a
direct
review.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
forget
my
hypothetical.
they're
never
going
to
come
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
--
why
is
it
a
strain?
i
mean
suppose
that
texas
decided
to
give
every
criminal
defendant
convicted
one
thousand
years
to
appeal.
you
know,
if
they
did,
i
guess
they
would
have
one
more
year
after
that
to
go
to
federal
habeas,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
what's
the
difference
between
that,
giving
them
a
thousand
years,
which
i
doubt
they
will
do,
and
what
they
have
said
here?
they
said
for
purposes
of
the
texas
rules
all
time
limits
shall
be
calculated
as
if
the
sentence
had
been
imposed
on
the
date
that
the
mandate
of
this
court
issues.
there
they
are.
the
texas
supreme
court
gave
him
all
that
time,
it's
whatever
it
was,
and
said
that's
the
time
you
have.
how,
how
is
that
different
from
the
legislature
decides
to
give
him
one
thousand
years?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
works.
your
system,
i
think,
works
in
that
instance,
as
i
understand
it.
don't
tell
me
i'm
right
if
i'm
wrong,
please.
but
the
--
as
you
understand
it,
he
finishes
--
he
doesn't
get
his
appeal,
you
know,
and
time
passes;
doesn't
take
it.
then,
five
years
later,
he
learns
for
the
first
time
and
the
first
time
he
could
have
learned
that
his
lawyer
tore
up
the
notification.
at
that
point,
1(b)
comes
into
play.
so
the
year
begins
to
run.
then,
in
your
idea,
he
has
--
he
has
a
year
to
go
to
federal
court.
but
wait,
it's
tolled
while
he
goes
to
state
court.
so
he
goes
to
state
court
having
just
learned
it.
and
now
he's
under
2
and
he
files
a
habeas
in
state.
now
the
remedy
of
the
state
habeas
is
to
reopen
the
direct
appeal.
but
we
should
count
that,
since
it's
a
remedy
of
a
habeas,
as
if
it
were
a
continuation
of
the
habeas
and
therefore
it
would
fall
within
2.
that's
your
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
--
correct?
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
case
ever
considered
that
to
my
knowledge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
only
difficulty
of
it
is
that
you
have
to
take
a
sort
of
leap
of
faith
of
some
kind
in
attaching
what
everybody's
calling
the
direct
appeal
as
if
it
were
actually
part
of
the
state
habeas
proceeding.
that's
i
think
the
hardest
part
of
your
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
(d).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
(b),
it's
(d).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
(d).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
think
it's
a
good
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
between
your
response
to
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia,
stand
enlightened.
