justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
should
that
be,
given
the
fact
that
the
day
it
is
going
to
run
from
is
the
day
that
--
which
the
state
of
texas
is
willing
to
take
action.
and
if
texas
is
willing
to
let
the
matter
ride
as
long
as
it
rode
here,
why
shouldn't
the
one-year
statute
apply?
in
other
words,
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
the
--
the
decision
about
what
is
appropriate,
that,
in
effect,
would
start
this
period
running,
is
texas's
and
as
long
as
texas
is
--
is
satisfied
with
it,
why
does
aedpa
have
an
independent
concern?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that
--
in
effect,
i
think
that
begs
the
question,
because
if
--
if
texas
says:
okay,
we
are
going
to
--
we
are
going
to
recognize
a
direct
appeal
starting
--
or
a
direct-appeal
right
exercisable
now,
then
(d)(
1)(a)
applies
by
its
own
terms
exactly
at
the
--
at
the
conclusion
of
the
process
which
texas
has
at
this
date
chosen
to
allow.
texas
doesn't
have
any
gripe.
it
decided
it
ought
to
act,
and
--
and,
undoubtedly,
it
should
have.
as
long
as
the
--
as
long
as
the
state
is
protected,
why
is
there
an
independent
interest
in
enforcing
aedpa,
or
enforcing
the
shortest
possible
rule
under
aedpa?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
we
are
--
we
are
concerned
about
state
interests,
aren't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
have
got
a
--
in
a
sense,
you
have
got
a
patchwork
now.
i
mean
not
--
not
every
state
rule
for
the
commencement
of
a
direct
appeal
in
the
normal
course
is
--
is
identical.
so
we
--
we
start
with
a
patchwork.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
aren't
they
--
and
i
will
--
you
know,
i
will
take
the
examples,
but
i
mean,
aren't
they
varied
because
the
--
the
circumstances
of
error
which
led
to
these
late
appeals
vary,
too?
and
isn't
that
exactly
the
way
it
ought
to
be?
