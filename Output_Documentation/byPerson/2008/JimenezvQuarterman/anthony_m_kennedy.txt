kennedy
and
you
don't
think
you
need
to
go
beyond
(a)
to
resolve
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
he
can't
go
to
federal
court
until
that
is
resolved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
do
prevail,
it
is
rather
dramatic,
because
your
client
was
stunningly
negligent.
he
does
nothing
for
four
and-a-half
years,
then
strolls
over
to
the
state
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
state
statute
that
allows
the
early
conviction
to
be
set
aside
and
the
appeal
reinstated
--
do
we
have
that
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
i
had
it.
do
we
have
it
in--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
saying
that
2
has
a
negative
implication.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
saying
that
2
had
a
negative
implication.
in
other
words,
the
time
shall
not
be
counted
while
it's
pending
and
that
it
should
be
counted
if
it's
not
pending
and
you
are
not
diligent.
