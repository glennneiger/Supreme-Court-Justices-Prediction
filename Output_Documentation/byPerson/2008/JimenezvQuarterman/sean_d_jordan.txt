mr.
sean
d.
jordan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress's
commitment
to
preventing
unnecessary
delays
in
the
filing
of
federal
habeas
claims
is
reflected
in
section
2244(d)(
1)'s
strict
one-year
limitations
period.
and
it
did
not
intend
that
inmates
who
wait
for
years
before
seeking
post-conviction
review
would
obtain
a
new
federal
limitation
start
date
when
an
out-of-time
appeal
is
awarded.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
your
honor,
the
reason
is
that
in
(d)(
1)(a)
congress
set
a
uniform
federal
rule
for
finality.
and
that
finality
date
is
either
when
the
--
the
period
of
direct
review
ends
by
the
conclusion
of
direct
review
or
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
seeking
direct
review.
so
when
that
happens,
by
statute,
congress
has
said
that
the
(d)(
1)(a)
finality
date
is
attached.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
justice
souter,
there
is
an
independent
federal
interest
that
the
court
has
recognized
consistently
in
avoiding
abusive
and
unnecessary
delay
in
the
filing
of
federal
habeas
claims.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
certainly,
justice
souter,
and
comity
and
finality
are
important
purposes
of
aedpa.
but
another
recognized
and
important
purpose
of
aedpa
is
to
avoid,
you
know,
abusive
and
unnecessary
delays
in
the
filing
of
federal
habeas
claims.
so
even
if
a
state
court
would
allow
stale
claims
years
later
to
be
heard,
that
doesn't
mean
that
federal
courts
need
to
hear
those
claims
10,
15
or
20
years
later.
but
there
is
a
second
point,
justice
souter,
that
--
that
is
a
problem
with
interpreting
(d)(
1)(a)
in
the
manner
the
petitioner
suggests,
which
is
that
it
will
make
it
far
more
difficult
for
federal
courts
to
administer
that
statute.
because
if
the
court
interprets
50
states
various
remedies
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
on
appeal,
then
what
that
means
is
you
are
no
longer
going
to
have
a
uniform
federal
rule
for
finality
in
any
of
these
cases.
what
you
are
going
to
have
is
a
patchwork
of
--
of
various
dates,
and
the
--
the
reality
is--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--but
the
difference
is
stark,
justice
souter,
because
the
--
the
dates
that
the
states
use
for
deadlines
on
initial
direct
appeal,
the
vast
majority,
are
within
a
short
timeframe,
20
days
to
90
days,
the
vast
majority.
whereas,
these
remedies
for
out-of-time
appeals
are
genuinely
varied,
and
they
vary
over
time
in
the
states.
and
if
i
could
give
you
a
couple
of
examples--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--well,
it
is
correct,
justice
souter,
that
some
states
--
the
remedy
varies
with
the
type
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
for
example,
the
difference
between
not
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
or
not
filing
a
brief.
but
my
point
is
that
those
remedies
--
the
petitioner's
brief
--
opening
brief
at
pages
29
to
32
says:
this
is
going
to
be
easy
for
federal
courts
to
apply,
because
what
they
can
do
is
look
at
these
six
different
aspects
of
the
nature
of
the
remedy
in
each
state,
and
they
can
determine
from
that
whether
--
when
--
whether
it
should
be
a
new
start
date
or
just
tolling.
the--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--well,
it's
--
it's
true,
your
honor,
that
the
--
that
states
can
fashion
whatever
remedy
they
want.
and
in
terms
of
the
comity
and
finality
interests,
it
is
going
to
be
a
responsibility
of
the
states
if
they
want
to
change
their
law.
but
because
in
--
in
these
out-of-time
appeals
--
and
most
of
the
states'
remedies
look
somewhat
like
in
--
somewhat
like
texas
in
the
sense
that
they
are
coming
through
post-conviction
review
and
they
--
they
are
awarding
another,
if
you
will,
chance
for
the
inmate
to
assert
his
claims.
there
is
not
a
reason
for
the
court
to
strain
the
interpretation
of
(d)(
1)(a)
to
protect
the
state's
interest--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
it's
true,
your
honor,
that
the
--
that
the
--
the
texas
court
made
a
decision
to
give
a
remedy
to
this
inmate
that
was
meant
to
duplicate
the
type
of
claims
he
could
have
raised
on
direct
appeal.
our
position
is
that
does
not
change
the
finality
date
under
(d)(
1)(a),
because
by
statute,
congress
has
said
that
that
date
attaches
at
the
--
at
the
expiration
of
direct
review.
and
--
and
the
natural
reading
of
that
language--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
it
says,
it
became
final
by--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--or
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
seeking
such
review.
and
the
importance
there,
your
honor,
is
that
it
--
it
anticipates
one
of
two
events
occurring.
in
other
words,
the
natural
reading
is
congress
understood
that
in
some
cases
there
wasn't
going
to
be
a
conclusion
of
direct
review.
there
was
going
to
be
an
expiration
of
time
for
seeking
review.
and
at
that
point
finality
would
attach.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
not
necessarily,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that's
the
reason
why
congress
already
provided
exceptions
in
the
statute
in
the
form
of
subsections
(b)
through
(d)
that
provide
later
start
dates
for
extenuating
circumstances
beyond
the
inmate's
control.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
i
understand,
your
honor.
and,
respectfully,
i
disagree
--
i
disagree
with
that,
and
here
is
the
reason
why
(d)(
1)(b)
applies.
and
(d)(
1)(b)
applies
because
in
--
for
example,
in
this
case
you
had
the
--
a
finding
that
there
was
constitutionally
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
to
the
extent
of
abandoning
the
inmate
on
appeal.
and
this
court's
precedent
has
said
that
when
there
is
--
in
the
trial
or
on
direct
appeal,
when
there
is
ineffectiveness
of
counsel
that
amounts
to
abandonment,
that
winds
up
being
imputed
to
the
state
because
it
means
that
the
state
got
or
--
or
kept
a
conviction
by
the
violation
of
the
inmate's
due-process
rights.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
i
do--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--i
do,
your
honor.
you
--
you
need
--
need
to
look
no
longer
than
the
case
that
is
cited
in
both
briefs.
it
is
evitts
versus
lucey,
and
it
is
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief
at
pages
27
and
37,
and
it
is
cited
in
our
brief
at
pages
36
and
37.
it
is
also
in
another
case
not
cited
in
the
brief,
but
it
is
also
noted
in
coleman
versus
thompson.
in
other
words,
the
court
has
consistently
said
that
where
there
is
constructive
denial
of
counsel
that
amounts
to
no
assistance
at
all
and
the
state
thereby
obtains
and
retains
a
conviction,
there
--
that
will
be
imputed
to
the
state.
now,
the
difficult
part
in
getting
(d)(
1)(b),
a
later
date
under
(d)(
1)(b),
is
that
you
also
need
the
causal
connection,
because
you
can't
just
have
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
it
also
has
to
have
caused
the
inmate
not
to
be
able
to
file
his
--
his
timely
federal
habeas.
that
happened
in
this
case
because
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
resulted
in
the
inmate
having
a
lack
of
notice.
the
attorney
did
not
serve
the
anders
brief
on
the
inmate
and
he
gave
the
wrong
address
to
the
court.
so
the
court
wound
up
sending
the
judgment
to
the
wrong
address
and
the
inmate
didn't
know.
that's
why
we
say
in
those
circumstances
(d)(
1)(b)
is
implicated.
but
it's
worth
noting
that
even
if
we
measure
the
date
from
september
of
1997
or
we
give
him
a
new
date
under
(d)(
1)(b),
then
that's
the
date
that
he
admits,
he
acknowledges,
he
knew
his
state
appeal
had
failed.
from
that
date,
he
waited
four
and
a
half
years
to
seek
any
type
of
post-conviction
review.
and
then
--
and
the
importance
of
that
is
that
congress
intended
to
give
a
year,
a
strict
one-year
period.
this
inmate
could
have
invoked
(d)(
1)(b)
and
he
did
not
and
he
waited
four
and
a
half
years
from
the
date
he
could
have
had.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
state
did
not
assert
a
laches
defense,
but
i
have
--
there
is
two
points
on
that:
one
is
that
the
only
case
--
there
is
one
case
and
it's
cited
in
the
brief,
ex
parte
carrio.
it's
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
there's
one
case
in
the
last
150
years
of
texas
jurisprudence
where
laches
has
actual
been
asserted
and
an
appeal
has
been
--
i'm
sorry
--
habeas
has
been
denied
based
on
that.
and
we
are
not
talking
about
--
we
are
not
asserting
laches
here.
we
are
talking
about
the
running
of
his
federal
limitations
period
under
a
federal
statute.
and
what
we
are
saying
is
this
inmate
was
clearly
not
diligent,
and
this
inmate
could
have
had
a
later
start
date,
but
even
from
that
later
start
date
he
would
--
he
would
--
the
federal
period
would
have
expired.
i
would
like
to
address
quickly
the
(d)(
2)
point
because
i
think
it's
important.
the
reference
was
made
that
(d)(
2)
doesn't
work,
in
other
words
(d)(
2)
tolling
won't
work
in
this
case
because
of
the
court's
decision
in
lawrence.
and
that's
--
that's
not
true,
because
the
situation
in
lawrence
was
different.
in
lawrence,
the
court's
decision
said
that
inmate
had
exhausted
all
of
his
post-conviction
review
in
the
florida
courts.
he
had
gone
all
the
way
to
the
top
court.
there
was
no
state
court
left
for
him
to
go
to.
and
the
question
was,
when
he
then
came
to
this
court
with
a
cert
petition,
could
that
cert
petition
count
as
tolling
time
of
review
for
the
state
post-conviction
review?
the
court
said
no.
that's
not
the
case
here.
this
is
more
like
the
court's
decision
in
carey
versus
saffold,
where
in,
carey,
the
court
said
--
the
court
acknowledged
that
under
california
law
where
inmates
can,
if
they
lose
their
habeas
in
a
lower
court,
they
can
then
file
an
original
writ
in
a
higher
court.
the
court
said
that,
while
the
inmate
is
going
through
that
process,
the
collateral
review
of
the
underlying
judgment
remained
pending,
it
remained
in
continuance.
and
that's
what's
happening
here.
if
you
look
at
what
happened
in
the
texas
court,
when
the
inmate
files
his
habeas
petition,
the
habeas
petition
itself
is
not
reviewing
the
pertinent
judgment.
that's
the
language
of
(d)(
2),
"reviewing
the
pertinent
judgment".
that
habeas
petition
asks
for
a
second
proceeding
to
review
the
pertinent
judgment.
it
says,
can
you
give
me
another
proceeding,
the
out-of-time
appeal,
to
review
the
pertinent
judgment?
and
so,
when
the
inmate
receives
that,
when
he
--
if
he
gets
the
out-of-time
appeal,
then
the
next
step,
the
out-of-time
appeal,
is
where
the
judgment
is
reviewed.
so,
the
court's
rationale
in
carey
is
applicable
with
even
greater
force
here
because
the
state
courts
have
told
him:
file
another
--
you
know,
continue
your
proceeding
so
you
can
get
review
of
the
underlying
judgment.
and
it
anticipates
a
two-step
process.
so
you
might
say
that
the
out-of-time
appeal
is
the
remedy
portion
of
the
habeas
proceeding
in
texas.
and
that's
why
the
(d)(
2)
tolling
does
work
and
lawrence
does
not
defeat
that.
and
in
this
case,
that
means
that
the
inmate,
if
he
had
acted
timely,
he
could
have
filed
his
state
post-conviction
petition.
if
he
had
obtained
an
out-of-time
appeal,
he
could
--
the
tolling
would
have
gone
on
while
--
throughout
the
out-of-time
appeal.
and
then
if
he
had
lost
that,
he
could
have
then
gone
to
federal
court.
and
so--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
that's
--
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
if
the
state
--
some
collateral
review
in
state
court
has
to
be
pending
for
tolling
to
be
going
on.
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
for
the
out-of-time
appeal
process
in
texas,
it
does
remain
pending.
the
reason
it
remains
pending
is
that
that
first
habeas
petition
is
asking
for,
and
if
the
inmate
gets
it
is
receiving,
further
collateral
review
of
that
judgment
because--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
and
that
first
state
habeas
petition
--
if
you
look
--
if
you
look
in
the
record,
you
will
see
the
state
habeas
petition
doesn't
challenge
anything
about
the
underlying
judgment.
it
doesn't
say,
give
me
relief
on
any
particular
claim.
what
it
says
is,
give
me
an
out-of-time
appeal
proceeding
so
that
i
can
challenge
the
underlying
judgment.
and
so,
when
the
inmate
obtains
that
out-of-time
appeal
to
--
to
get
review
of
the
underlying
judgment,
(d)(
2)
tolling
still
applies.
and
that--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--that's
correct.
the
out-of-time
appeal
time,
your
honor,
won't
count.
so
what
we'll
go
on
is
that
if
his
habeas
was
granted
and
he
was
allowed
the
out-of-time
appeal,
he
could
pursue
the
out-of-time
appeal.
the
tolling
of
the
federal
limitations
period
under
(d)(
2)
would
remain
during
that
entire
time,
if
he
then
loses
his
out-of-time
appeal
and
he
comes
out
of
the
other
side
of
the
process.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
that's
--
i
mean,
if
he
does,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
if
he
doesn't
file
his
state
habeas
within
one
year?
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
your
honor,
if
he
doesn't
file--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--well,
it
would
be,
your
honor,
unless
he
fell
into
one
of
the
exceptions
provided
by
congress
in
(b),
(c),
or
(d).
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
your
honor,
two
points
in
response.
the
first
is
that
--
is
that
i'm
assuming,
in
your
hypothetical,
that
it
is
an
inmate
who
has
attempted
to
be
diligent,
has
attempted
to
contact
the
court.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
and
if
he
has
attempted
to
contact
the
court
and
he
still
had
not
found
out,
the
circumstances
--
i
mean,
we've
looked
at
a
lot
of
these
cases
and
there
is
just
very
few
out
there
where
an
inmate
who
is
being
diligent
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
find
out
one
way
or
the
other.
so,
it
may
be
that
if
he
wasn't
able
to,
he
might
fall
under
(d)(
1)(b).
but
if
he
didn't,
your
honor,
and
it
was
an
unusual
--
and
it
would
have
to
be
a
very
unusual
circumstance
--
it
might
be
that
equitable
tolling
could
apply.
but
this
court
has
recognized,
in
dodd
v.
united
states,
in
interpreting
the
similar
provisions
in
the
counterpart
to
2244(d)(
1)(c),
in
the
context
of
when
the
court
recognizes
a
retroactively
applicable--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--well,
presumably,
your
honor,
the
reason
that
he
didn't
would
have
--
if
he
was
being
diligent,
if
he
was
--
because
he
needs
to
be
diligent.
he
can't
just
sit
in
his
cell--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--and
say,
"i'm
not
going
to
do
anything.
"
if
he
is
being
diligent
and
if
he
is
really
attempting
to
find
out
what
happened
to
his
case,
then
probably
something
has
happened,
either,
you
know,
through
the
state
system
or
through
the
attorney.
but
if
it
has
not
--
you
know,
again,
we've
looked
at
a
lot
of
these
cases.
we
haven't
seen
cases
like
that,
but--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--yes.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
exactly.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
no--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--that's
--
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
--
under
the
court's
decision
is
cases
like
evitts
v
lucey,
if
there
has
been
a
constructive
denial
of
counsel,
an
abandonment
of
counsel
to
the
degree
where
there
was
effectively
no
appeal,
then
that
could
be
imputed
to
the
state.
the
reasoning
has
been
that
it's
because
the
state
was
able
to
get
or
keep
a
conviction
without
the
inmate
having
due
process.
that
would
be
--
the
inmate
would
still
have
to
have
the
fact
that
that
impediment
actually
caused
him
to
--
and
this
case
is
a
good
example.
even
though
this
inmate
--
you
know,
there
was
ineffectiveness
of
counsel
--
if
the
court
had
the
right
address,
and
court
had
sent
him
the
judgment,
then
there
would
not
have
been
the
causal
connection;
he
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
get
the
(d)(
1)(d)
date.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
well,
you
are
exactly
right,
justice
scalia,
that
(d)(
1)(d),
in
this
case,
because
it
is
claim-specific
it
only
does
apply
to
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
on
appeal.
we
noted
in
our
brief
that
it
was
implicated,
but
because
he
got
relief
on
that
claim
in
the
state
court,
there
was
no
reason
for
him
to
--
so
he
wouldn't
have
--
the
(d)
was
implicated
but
didn't
need
to
be
asserted.
we
are
that
saying
(d)(
1)(b)--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--is
--
is
--
in
play
in
the
case
because
of
the
unique
circumstances
of
this
--
of
this--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--it's
the
interplay
of
these
two
--
of
these
two
provisions,
because
both
of
them
in
any
particular
case
could
be
in
play.
if
the
--
if,
for
example,
this
inmate
had
not
gotten
relief
in
the
state
court
for
his
ineffectiveness
of
counsel
on
appeal,
then
the
(d)(
1)(d)
could
have
provided
a
later
start
date
for
that
claim.
it's
(d)(
1)(b)
that
applies
to
the
other
claims.
and
the
--
you
know,
the
bottom
line
notion
for
our
position
is
that
it
cannot
be
that
congress
intended
in
this
--
this
statute
to
be
interpreted
such
that
a
non-diligent
inmate
who
waits
four
and
a
half
years
after
he
knows
his
appeal
has
failed
to
seek
any
sort
of
post-conviction
relief
will
obtain
a
new
start
date.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
a
number
of
states
that
have
--
if
we
are
talking
about
remedies
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
on
appeal,
there
are
a
number
of
states
that
have
deadlines;
but
there
are
at
least
19
states
that
provide
remedies
for
ineffectiveness
of
counsel
on
appeal
with
no
statute
of
limitations.
and
in
--
and
in
those
states
and
in
many
cases
what
that
means
is
that
the
inmate,
like
this
inmate,
could
come
five
years
later,
ten
years
later,
and
make
those
claims.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i'd
like
to
address
a
point
that's
made
in
the
reply
brief,
about--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
our
position
is
that
texas
--
not
texas
or
any
state
can
rewrite
the
--
this
federal
statute
and
a
finality
date
in
this
federal
statute.
but
i
want
to
address
quickly
the
point
that's
made
in
a
reply
brief
that
the
court
not
worry
about
this
because
there
is
no
incentive
for
non-capital
inmates
to
--
to
sit
on
their
rights.
and
i
have
two
points
i
want
to
make
on
that.
the
first
is
congress
has
already
made
that
decision.
obviously
congress
was
concerned
that
even
non-capital
inmates
could
sit
on
their
rights
because
they
imposed
this
strict
one-year
limitation
on
non-capital
inmates.
but
the
second
point
is
that
as
a
practical
matter
this
happens
in
many,
many
cases.
these
cases
provide
the
example.
in
this
case
the
inmate
waited
five
years.
the
frasch
v
peguese
case
that
is
coming
out
of
the
fourth
circuit
on
an
out-of-time
appeal,
the
inmate
--
a
non-capital
inmate
waited
ten
years
to
seek
post-conviction
review.
and
so
these
are
cases
that
we
think
are
representative
of
many
case
that
would
come
through
the
district
courts,
and
that
in
fact
non-capital
inmates,
whatever
their
incentives
may
be,
do
as
a
practical
matter
sometimes
sit
on
their
rights.
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
that's
correct.
and
the
problem
is
that
when
--
when
for
whatever
reason
they
sit
on
their
rights
ten
or
15
years,
our
point
is
that
that
doesn't
mean
they
can
come
back
in
and
have
federal
courts
hearing
stale
claims
that
should
have
been
brought,
if
the
inmate
was
being
diligent,
years
earlier.
and
there's
--
and
this
case
is
a
case
in
point.
this
inmate
has
--
has
provided
no
reason
why
--
no
legitimate
reason
why
he
waited
four
and
a
half
years.
the
only
reason
he
provided
was
i
am
a
pro
se
inmate
and
i
--
i
don't
know
what
the
law
is.
and
you
can
his
data
in
the
joint
appendix
pages
109
to
112,
and
those
are
directly
rejected
by
the
court
in
the
johnson
case,
johnson
v
united
states.
the
court
said
in
that
case--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--that's
correct,
justice--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--your
honor,
a
lot
of
them
are.
a
lot
of
them
are,
and
in
fact
there
were
two
anders
briefs
filed
in
this
case.
to
show
how
--
how
weak
his
claims
were,
when
he
got
the
out-of-time
appeal,
he
was
appointed
a
new
attorney
and
she
filed
an
anders
brief.
so
you
had
two
attorneys
in
this
case
who
said--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--i
think
that
is
exactly
right,
justice
stevens.
but
the
procedural
questions
remain--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
--indeed.
this
case,
the
underlying
merits
are,
there
basically
are
no
merits
to
his
underlying
claims
is
a
point
we
have
fully
briefed
and
i
won't
address
here
unless
there
are
questions
from
the
court.
and
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i'm--
mr.
sean
d.
jordan
that's
a
state
action,
but
as
the
court's
questioning
indication,
the
question
is,
is
state
action
that
is
an
impediment
to
filing
a
federal
habeas
petition,
and
all
of
our
cases
answered
that
question.
the
final
point
is
about
(d)(
2)
and
my
friend
says
that
this
isn't
like
lawrence
v
florida,
because
here
there
is
more
proceedings.
but
the
court's
holding
was
this,
and
it
was
unambiguous:
when
the
post-conviction
court
enters
its
mandate,
so
that
the
time
to
seek
cert
starts
to
run,
that's
when
the
post-conviction
application
is
no
longer
pending;
and
when
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
decided
the
petitioner's
claim
and
said
he
had
an
out-of-time
appeal,
it
issued
its
mandate
and
the
mandate
is
in
the
joint
appendix.
and
somebody
--
the
state
could
have
sought
cert
in
that
case,
and
the
post-conviction
application
was
no
longer
pending.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
you're
right,
you
can
the
case
on
the
basis
of
label
or
substance,
but
it
is
unambiguous
that
this
is
not
post-conviction
review
in
what
we
have
been
calling
the
second
appeal.
teague
retroactivity
does
not
apply;
all
the
constitutional
rights
that
are
announced
in
the
meantime
apply;
you
have
a
right
to
a
counsel;
the
usual
standards
of
post-conviction
relief
in
terms
of
having
us
show
an
extra
layer
of
prejudice
don't
apply.
this
is
just
like
any
other
appeal
the
texas
court
of
appeals
and
the
courts
of
criminal
appeal
would
decide
and
that
makes
it
a
(d)(
1)
case.
thank
you
very
much.
