chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-6984,
jimenez
v.
quarterman.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
does
your
position
depend
upon
the
proposition
that
we
are
not
free
to
consider
sort
of
a
second
direct
appeal
as
part
of
the
collateral
review
process?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
it
doesn't
--
or
does
it
really
make
a
difference?
i
mean,
if
you
view
the
direct
appeal
that
is
the
result
of
the
collateral
review
process
as
part
of
the
collateral
review
process,
that
time
is
tolled.
and
if
you
take
your
view
and
regard
it
as
not
final
to
trigger
the
process
until
you
have
another
final
decision,
it
kind
of
leads
to
the
same
result,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
does
that
really
matter?
i
mean,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
federal
statute
of
limitations
is
to
make
sure
these
things
get
done
within
one
year.
and
if
he
waits
a
year
before
filing,
then
he's
out
of
time
under
aedpa.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
but
is
that
right?
i
mean
unless
you
count,
as
i
gather
your
friends
on
the
other
side
would
do,
the
period
of
direct
appeal
as
part
of
the
collateral
review
process?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
state
convicting,
penalizing
the
defendant
despite
the
fact
that
his
constitutional
right
to
competent
counsel
was
--
he
lost
that
right
because
of
the
failure
of
notification?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
this
just
a
dispute
about
the
label?
because
texas
chooses
to
call
the
proceeding
that
you
get
if
you
are
successful
on
collateral
review
a
second
direct
appeal,
you
would
count
finality
one
way;
if
they
just
switch
the
label
and
say
that
is
the
collateral
review
appeal
process,
then
you
would
agree
with
them?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
except
that
you
kind
of
elide
the
point
that
congress
and
aedpa
quite
clearly
wanted
these
federal
claims
to
be
brought
within
a
year.
this
seems
to
allow
the
state
processes
to
trump
the
one-year
requirement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
said
that
it's
unusual
for
the
texas
state
to
grant
these.
but
presumably
you
could
challenge
the
determination
five,
ten,
15
years
later
by
the
texas
court
not
to
grant
you
a
direct
appeal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah.
let's
say
this
fellow
--
the
state
court
says,
well,
you
know
what,
we
are
not
going
to
give
you
another
direct
appeal.
and
he
says,
well,
that
decision
was
made
in
violation
of
my
federal
constitutional
rights.
what
happens
then
with
respect
to
federal
habeas?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
is
he
challenging
the
first
conviction,
or
is
he
challenging
the
failure
of
the
state
court
to
give
him
another
direct
appeal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
i
gather
if
he
is
granted
the
collateral
--
the
direct
--
second
direct
appeal.
what
if
the
court
says
no,
we
don't
agree
that
you
were
denied
your
right
to
a
direct
appeal;
we
think
you
had
it
so
you
don't
get
another
one.
and
he
says
that
determination
has
been
made
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
doesn't
it
depend
upon
the
allegation
he
wishes
to
make?
say
he
comes
in
in
one
of
these
proceedings
four
and
a
half
years
later
and
says,
you
should
give
me
another
direct
review,
i
didn't
have
it.
and
the
court
says,
well,
no,
we're
not
going
to
give
you
one.
and
he
says,
well,
you
give
it
to
all
the
white
criminal
defendants
and
you
are
not
giving
it
to
me,
so
that
violates
equal
protection?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
my
hypothetical
supposes
a
new
constitutional
violation.
and
i
am
just
suggesting
that
the
fact
that
texas
doesn't
grant
this
relief
freely
doesn't
mean
that
that's
a
sufficient
answer
with
respect
to
the
abuse
of
federal
habeas.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
jordan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can't
we
leave
that
--
and
you
suggest
that
it
is
a
federal
rule.
i
am
not
sure
that's
right.
why
don't
we
just
leave
that
up
to
the
states?
i
am
not
--
if
i
don't
accept
your
friend's
determination
that
this
is
a
matter
of
substance
rather
than
form,
states
have
it
--
excuse
me
--
within
their
control.
here
--
your
state
calls
it
another
direct
appeal.
why
don't
we
just
take
them
at
their
word?
and
if
they
don't
want
to
get
into
the
business
of
having
a
federal
review
of
a
second
direct
appeal
that
they
choose
to
allow,
they
just
call
it
something
else.
call
it
a
--
you
know,
the
collateral
review
of
a
successful
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
file
whatever.
and
then,
you
know,
under
aedpa
that
wouldn't
count
as
a
new
final
judgment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
was
just
going
to
stop
you
there.
it
doesn't
say
that
starts
to
run
at
the
expiration
of
direct
review.
it
says
on
the
date
the
judgment
became
final.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--by
the
conclusion
of
direct
review.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
a
case
to
cite
for
that?
because
i
understood
your
friend
to
say
the
opposite:
that
wouldn't
count
as
an
impediment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
i
resolve
that
dispute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
say
"the
first
habeas
petition"
you
mean
the
first
state
habeas
petition?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
what
do
you
mean,
(d)(
2)
tolling
still
applies>
["]?
that
the
direct
appeal
time
does
not
count
against
his
one
year?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought,
counsel,
that
your
response
to
that
was
when
you
have
a
failure
of
counsel,
that
that
is
imputed
to
the
state.
so
it
is
a
removal
of
an
impediment
created
by
the
state.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
do
i
understand
correctly
that,
based
on
your
answers
and
your
friend's
answers,
there
is
no
difference
between
the
way
you
two
in
substance
read
these
provisions?
he
relies
on
(d)(
1)(a);
you
rely
on
the
combination
of
(d)(
2)
and
(d)(
1)(b)
and
(d);
except
in
the
situation
where
you
have
a
non-diligent
prisoner,
and
in
that
case,
his
theory
leads
to
a
different
result
than
yours.
he
excuses
the
non-diligence
because
the
state
chooses
to
label
the
second
opportunity
as
final.
you
do
not
excuse
the
non-diligence
because
in
the
absence
of
diligence,
(d)(
1)(b)
and
(d)(
1)(d)
do
not
apply.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
it
comes
down
--
it
does
come
down
to
his,
where
he
began
his
argument,
which
is
he
said
that
this
is
an
unusual
case
where
texas
is
being
overly
generous
to
convicts,
because
you
choose
to
label
it
as
direct
appeal
and
therefore
that
means
someone
that
the
states
allow
to
have
another
direct
appeal,
even
though
they
have
been
non-diligent,
get
the
benefit
of
the
--
of
a
new
finality
date.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
jordan.
mr.
goldstein,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
--
he
cited
most
prominently
the
evitts
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-6984,
jimenez
versus
quarterman.
