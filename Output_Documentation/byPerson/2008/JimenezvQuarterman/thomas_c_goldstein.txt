mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
texas
courts
in
this
case
reinstated
the
petitioner's
direct
appeal,
the
texas
court
of
appeals
decided
that
appeal
like
it
would
decide
any
other
case
on
direct
review.
we
filed
a
petition
for
discretionary
review
in
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals,
which
was
denied,
and
it
was
considered
like
any
other
appeal
would
be.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
the
final
judgment
that
indisputably
results
from
those
rulings
triggers
the
one-year
statute
of
limitations
to
file
a
federal
habeas
corpus
application.
the
statute
that
governs
that
question
is
reproduced
in
the
blue
brief
at
page
1.
section
2244(d)(
1)(a)
prescribes
"a
1-year
period
of
limitation
that
shall
apply
to
an
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
by
a
person
in
custody
pursuant
to
the
judgment
of
the
state
court.
"
"the
limitation
period
shall
run
from
the
latest
of.
"
--and
it
identifies
four
dates,
the
first
of
which
is
"the
date
on
which
the
judgment
became
final
by
the
conclusion
of
direct
review
or
the
expiration
of
time
for
seeking
such
review.
"
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
right,
justice
kennedy.
subsection
(a)
resolves
this
case
by
its
plain
terms.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
decided
this
case
--
this
issue,
i'm
sorry
--
in
2004
in
a
case
called
salinas,
and
it
thought
that
the
factual
scenario
of
the
case
was
more
logically
covered
by
subsection
(d)(
2)
of
the
statute,
which
is
on
page
2
of
the
blue
brief.
and
that
provision
is
the
tolling
provision,
and
it
says:
"the
time
during
which
a
properly
filed
application
for
state
post-conviction
or
other
collateral
review
with
respect
to
the
pertinent
judgment
or
claim
is
pending
shall
not
be
counted
toward
any
period
of
limitation
under
the
subsection.
"
and
the
fifth
circuit's
view
in
that
salinas
case
was
that
the
better
way
of
looking
at
this
is
that
when
the
state
post-conviction
court
awarded
relief
of
further
direct
review,
all
of
that
should
be
regarded
as
part
of
the
post-conviction
process.
but
four
years
after
--
three
years
after
the
fifth
circuit
decided
salinas,
this
court
decided
lawrence
v.
florida,
and
lawrence
disposes
of
the
fifth
circuit's
logic
in
salinas,
because
lawrence
says
that
when
the
post-conviction
court,
here
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals,
issues
its
mandate
the
application
for
post-conviction
review
is
no
longer
pending.
and
so
there
isn't
any
reason
to
believe
that
congress
thought
this
factual
scenario
was
covered
by
the
tolling
provisions
of
(d)(
2).
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
doesn't
depend
on
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
because,
as
i
have
said
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
you
can
resolve
this
under
(d)(
1).
but
i
was
just
trying
to
explain
why
the
fifth
circuit,
which
struggled
with
how
to
handle
this
scenario,
was
wrong
in
thinking
it
was
governed
by
the
tolling
provision.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
in
many
cases,
but
not
all,
including
this
one.
the
difference
is
that
if
you
regard
this
as
governed
by
tolling,
that
the
second
--
what
we
will
call
for
purposes
of
the
argument,
just
so
we
know,
the
second
appeal,
so
the
appeal
that's
granted
by
the
post-conviction
report,
if
you
regard
the
proper
way
of
reading
2244
to
be
you
have
to
regard
that
as
being
tolled
and
the
start
date
is
the
dismissal
of
the
original
appeal,
if
the
state
petitioner
seeks
post-conviction
review
more
than
one
year
after
the
dismissal
of
the
first
appeal,
his
federal
time
is
done.
so,
this--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
is
--
it
is
the
case
that
congress
wanted
it
done
within
one
year.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
one
year
of
what?
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
so,
there
are
four
different
possible
start
dates.
we
know
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
wrong
in
the
salinas
case
when
it
said
that
congress
envisioned
only
a
linear
time
period
stopped
only
by
tolling
that
would
run
from
the
first
disposition
of
the
case,
because
2244(d)(
1)(b),
(c),
and
(d)
are
all
provisions
under
which
the
time
can
expire
and
then
be
restarted.
so,
what
we
think
congress
wanted
when
it
was
picking
start
dates
and
the
start
date
in
(d)(
1)(a),
the
one
that
usually
applies,
is
it
wanted
the
state
courts
on
direct
review
to
be
done
with
the
case,
finish
it
off.
then
the
state
petitioner
will
have
one
year
to
start
the
state
post-conviction
process
and
when
that's
done
go
on
to
federal
court.
the
reason
we
think
congress
wanted
to
include
the
second
appeal,
the
conclusion
of
the
second
appeal,
as
the
trigger
is
that
what's
going
on
in
the
federal
district
court
is
you
are
trying
to
decide
if
the
state
court's
disposition
of
the
case
is
contrary
to
clearly
established
law
as
established
by
this
court.
and
you
won't
know
that,
you
won't
even
know
what
the
federal
district
court
is
supposed
to
be
reviewing,
until
the
conclusion
of
the
second
appeal.
if
i
could
just
illustrate
that,
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
43,
is
the
state
court
opinion
in
this
case.
the
texas
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
and
resolved
his,
the
petitioner's,
federal
constitutional
claims.
and
it
only
did
that
in
the
second
appeal.
and
that's
what
congress
was
concerned
with
the
federal
district
court's
reviewing.
it's
--
when
this
opinion
is
issued
and
then
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals,
which
is
their
highest
court
in
criminal
cases,
denies
review,
then
it's
logical
for
the
time
period
to
start.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay,
can
i
answer
that
question,
justice
ginsburg,
in
two
parts?
first
most
directly,
i
want
to
explain
our
position
with
respect
to
(b)
and
(d)
and
then
i
want
to
discuss
the
broad
thematic
concern
that's
raised
by
our
case.
here's
the
troubling
fact
by
our
case,
and
that
is
the
prospect
that
multiple
state
defendants
will
take
more
than
a
year,
and
i
would
like
to
deal
with
that
thematic
point
and
explain
why
i
don't
think
that's
a
concern.
but
to
start
directly
with
your
point,
(b)
and
(d),
assuming
that
they
apply
for
a
moment,
will
only
accomplish
the
following
--
and
then
i
want
to
explain
why
i
don't
think
they
would
apply.
but
even
if
they
apply,
what
they
would
do
is
defer
the
start
date
of
the
one
year.
so
on
the
facts
in
this
case,
one
year
after
--
11
months
or
so
after
the
texas
court
of
appeals
erroneously
dismissed
the
petitioner's
first
direct
appeal
without
giving
him
the
opportunity
to
file
a
pro
se
brief,
he
found
out.
on
the
state's
view,
the
one-year
federal
habeas
corpus
time
would
be
deferred
for
11
months,
and
that
is
a
very
generous
defendant-favoring
position
for
texas
to
take
in
this
court.
if
it
then
starts,
it
doesn't
--
that
reading
does
not
accomplish
what
congress
wanted
in
2244,
because
the
state
prisoner,
though
the
time
will
have
been
deferred
for
a
year,
will
still
have
to
file
for
federal
habeas
corpus
within
a
year,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
will
get
a
second
direct
appeal.
so
he
will
be
proceeding
in
both
courts.
his
start
date
will
have
been
deferred
for
11
months,
but
he
nonetheless
one
year
later
must
appear
in
a
federal
district
court
in
texas,
even
though
on
post-conviction
review
in
the
state
courts
he
is
sent
back
to
direct
review.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
correct.
and
that's
the
argument
about
lawrence.
that
argument
is
not
sustainable
in
light
of
lawrence.
just
to
say
that
you
have
their
argument
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
state's
position
is,
as
the
fifth
circuit
held
in
the
salinas
case,
that
when
you
get
relief
on
post-conviction
review
and
you
are
sent
back
to
the
state
system,
(d)(
2)
continues
to
apply,
but
that
is
not
correct.
the
tolling
stops,
and
that
is
because,
as
lawrence
held,
the
application
which
is
his
post-conviction
application
in
the
state
court,
saying
that
i
was
deprived
of
my
right
to
appeal,
is
no
longer
pending.
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
issued
its
mandate.
so
that's
why
this
anomaly
arises
under
the
application
of
(b)
or
(d)
that
we
don't
think
congress
could
have
intended.
now,
justice
ginsburg,
there
is
a
second
part
to
my
answer,
and
that
is
the
specific
point
about
whether
(b)
and
(d)
do
by
their
terms
apply;
and
here
we
are
in
the
anomalous
position
that
if,
again,
texas
is
arguing
very
defendant-favoring
readings
of
(b)
and
(d)
and
i,
representing
the
habeas
petitioner,
am
in
the
unusual
role
of
questioning
whether
these
later
start
dates
apply.
but
here
our
--
the
lower
courts
i
think
it
is
clear
would
say
that
(b)
and
(d)
don't
apply.
to
take
you
to
the
textual
--
the
text
of
the
statute,
again,
(b)
appears
at
the
bottom
of
page
1
of
the
blue
brief;
and
that
has
a
start
date
of
the
date
on
which
the
impediment
for
filing
an
application
created
by
state
action
in
violation
of
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states
is
removed,
if
the
applicant
was
prevented
from
filing
by
such
state
action.
and
the
lower
courts,
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
pretty
uniformly
conclude
that
the
failure
to
give
a
defendant
notice
that
his
appeal
has
been
dismissed
is
not
an
impediment
created
by
state
action
to
him
filing
a
federal
habeas
corpus
application.
and
so
their
attempt
to
grapple
with
our
unusual
facts
has
--
would
substantially
broaden
the
application
of
subsection
(b).
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it's
just
--
it's
not
regarded
as
an
impediment.
the
--
the
courts
--
the
lower
courts
take
quite
literally
that
there
has
to
be
an
impediment.
the
lower
court
decisions
grappling
with
what
an
impediment
is
deal
with
the
situation
where
a
prison
warden,
for
example,
does
not
allow
you
access
to
the
prison
mails
or
somehow
access
to
the
legal
resources
you
in
order
to
be
able
to
file
it.
he
won't
deliver
the
habeas
corpus
application.
(d)
is
even
easier,
i
think,
and
that
is
the
deadline
starts
from
the
date
on
which
the
factual
predicate
of
the
claim
or
claims
presented
could
have
been
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
and
the
reason
the
state
is
not
right
about
that
provision
and
does
not
even
really
seriously
argue
it
is
that
the
claims
referenced
in
(d)
are
the
claims
that
are
presented
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
application.
here
that's
the
claim
that
he
had
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel
and
that
the
judge
was
biased
against
him.
they
are
not
the
claim
that
he
received
--
that
he
was
denied
the
right
to
an
appeal.
and
so
it
just
--
there
is
no
textual
basis
to
say
that
the
later
start
date
would
apply
under
(d).
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
sir.
we
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
substance.
as
--
the
language
that
we
use
in
a
footnote
in
our
reply
brief
addressing
this
is
whether
the
proceeding
has
the
hallmarks
of
direct
review.
there
are
two
states
that
do
have
a
procedure,
south
carolina
and
delaware,
in
which
you
can
raise
your
claim
on
post-conviction
review
that
you
were
deprived
of
your
right
to
a
direct
appeal.
and
the
post-conviction
court
has
the
power
to
decide
that
on
post-conviction
review.
we
haven't
found
a
case
in
which
they
actual
exercised
the
power,
but
it
appears
that
48
of
the
50
states
deal
with
this
problem
the
way
texas
does,
and
that
is
the
relief
that
you
get
is
that
you
are
sent
back
into
the
direct
review
system.
and
then
we
think
it's
covered
quite
plainly
by
the
text
of
(d)(
1).
when
that
direct
review
is
over,
direct
review
concludes
by
its
plain
terms.
now,
justice
ginsburg,
i
had
said
that
i
wanted
to
come
back
and
deal
with
the
thematic
problem
that
might
concern
the
court
about
our
case,
and
that
is
the
prospect
that
we
will
have
defendants
filing
state
post-conviction
applications
more
than
a
year
late,
which
could
trouble
the
court.
as
the
chief
justice
indicated,
congress
had
a
concern
with
moving
this
process
along.
in
addition
just
to
the
plain
text
of
the
statute
which
we
think
is
controlling,
there
are
i
think
three
points.
the
first
is
there
are
state
limitations
principles
that
get
these
state
prisoners
to
file
their
applications
in
a
timely
way.
now,
in
the
great
majority
of
states
that's
set
by
a
number
of
years.
in
some
states
like
texas
it's
applied
by
the
principle
of
laches.
and
the
important
point
and
the
reason
we
are
here
today
is
that
texas,
for
whatever
reason
--
and
the
time
limitations
are
intended
to
protect
texas
here
--
decided
not
to
assert
that
his
state
post-conviction
application
was
untimely.
it
didn't
object
to
the
granting
of
relief
to
the
petitioner
at
all.
the
second
reason,
in
addition
to
the
state's
own
limitations
period,
is
that
the
aedpa
one-year
limitations
period
has
real
force.
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
in
which
a
state
defendant
is
going
to
allege
that
he
was
deprived
of
his
right
to
an
appeal
and
raise
that
claim
on
state
post-conviction
review,
he's
going
to
lose
that
claim.
the
--
the
states
don't
give
this
stuff
out
like
candy,
and
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
is
not,
you
know,
constantly
reinstating
defendant's
appeals.
and
defendants
know
that.
and
unless
you
prevail
on
this
claim,
you
are
stuck
with
the
one-year
aedpa
time
that
runs
from
the
dismissal
of
your
first
appeal.
and
so
you
have
every
incentive
in
the
world
to
get
into
state
court
quickly.
and
the
third
is
just
the
general
notion
that
defendants
in
non-capital
cases
don't
have
a
real
incentive
to
just
delay
before
instituting
a
state
post-conviction
review.
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
--
can
i
just
ask
one
point
of
clarification?
if
he
instituted
it
more
than
a
year
after
the
dismissal
of
the
first
proceeding,
he
is
out
of
time,
because
there
is
only
one
final
judgment,
and
that
is
the
original
dismissal.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
if
he
instituted
it
--
can
i
just
say
six
months?
so
six
months'
after
the
first
dismissal,
the
petitioner
appears
in
the
texas
post-conviction
court.
at
that
point
(d)(
2)
starts
to
apply,
because
he
has
a
properly
filed
application
for
state
post-conviction
relief.
the
state
court
--
the
state
post-conviction
court
takes
three
months
to
dispose
of
it,
a
year
to
dispose
of
it;
it
doesn't
matter.
when
the
state
post-conviction
court
is
done
and
in
your
hypothetical
denies
him
relief,
he
has
six
months
left
to
go
to
federal
district
court.
(d)(
2)
operates
as
it
should.
while
the
case
is
sitting
in
the
state
post-conviction
court--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is
correct,
because
he
has
not
exhausted
his
claim.
when
the
claim
is
that
you
were
denied
your
right
to
a
direct
appeal,
the
only
place
that
you
can
raise
that
claim
is
state
post-conviction
review.
federal
habeas
corpus
requires
you
to
exhaust
your
available
state
remedies.
your
available
state
remedy
for
that
is
state
post-conviction
review.
he
may
not
appear
in
federal
district
court.
the
district
court
i
think
would
abuse
its
discretion
in
staying
a
plainly
unexhausted
claim.
that
wouldn't
be
good
cause,
as
this
court
has
said,
for
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
justice
kennedy,
the
state,
as
i
said,
did
not
raise
this
argument
in
the
place
where
we
think
it's
appropriate,
and
that
no
record
was
built
on
laches.
it
does
--
it
does
have
that
feel.
i
do
think
that
the
court's
opinion
could
make
clear
that
this
anomaly
arises
from
the
fact
that,
despite
the
fact
that
the
texas
courts
have
made
clear
that
there
are
laches
principles
and
limitations--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
is
for
the
state
to
raise,
and
we
cite
our
texas
authority
for
that
in
our
reply
brief,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
kennedy,
that
is
section
11
--
article
11.07.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
do
not
believe
you
do.
and
the
reason
is
that
article
11.07
is
just
the
general
texas
post-conviction
regime.
the
procedure
that
is
used
for
reinstating
direct
appeals
is
developed
through
caselaw,
not
by
statute.
justice
scalia,
there
was
a
final
point
that
i
was
about
to
make
when
i
said,
look,
defendants
in
non-capital
cases
have
every
incentive,
if
they
want
to
get
relief,
to
move
their
cases
along.
the
court
may
be
concerned
about
capital
cases
where
there
is
the
opposite
concern,
that
defendants
will
try
and
keep
their
cases
alive,
if
you
will.
and
texas
recognizes
this
point
and
has
a
deadline
by
statute
that
is
quite
short
for
instituting
post-conviction
relief
in
capital
cases.
they
simply
recognize
that
laches
is
the
way
to
handle
the
prospect
of
delay
in
non-capital
cases.
we
don't
think
there
is
any
reason
for
this
court
to
override
that
determination,
to
second
guess
the
judgment
of
the
texas
court
that
the
judgment
is
not
final
until
the
reinstated
appeal
concludes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
have
to
ask
one
question,
sir,
because
the
answer
is
it
depends.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
question
is,
when
he
files
for
federal
habeas
corpus
the
first
time
in
your
hypothetical,
i
take
it
he
doesn't
raise
the
claim--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--he
raises
a
substantive
claim,
like
the
judge
was
biased
against
him
and
the
like?
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
regarded
as
a
first
habeas
application,
because
the
claim
did
not
--
i
think
the
judgment
did
not
arise
until
later.
i
don't
believe
a
case
like
that
has
arisen.
i
think--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
strange
thing
is
that
it
is
an
exhausted
set
of
claims.
so
it
is
a
proper
federal
habeas
corpus
application,
because
he
went
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it's
proper
in
terms
of
it
being
exhausted.
it
would
be
dismissed,
to
be
clear.
so
his
appeal
was
denied,
right?
he
doesn't
file
an
appeal
in
the
hypothetical.
so
when
he
shows
up
in
federal
district
court,
it's
an
exhausted
--
it
is
--
he
would
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
exhaust,
in
fact,
because
he
didn't
pursue
his--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--but
he
--
but
he
was--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
i
took
it
to
be--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
think,
though,
i
can
tell
you
this
with
some
confidence.
the
way
that
this
thing
happened
in
texas
is
the
way
that
it
happens
in
the
states,
and
the
way
it
happens
in
federal
courts
as
well
under
2255.
you
file
a
post-conviction
application.
you
say:
i
was
denied
entirely
my
right
of
appeal
by
something
the
court
did
or
something
my
lawyer
did,
and
then
you
get
to
pursue
your
appeal.
and
that's
what
congress
wanted
the
federal
district
court
on
habeas
corpus
to
review.
so
logically,
the
one
year
begins
to
run
after
that's
done.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
in
many
cases,
mr.
chief
justice,
of
course,
the
state
appeals
can
take
20
years
to
go
up
and
down
and
back
and
forth
from
state
post-conviction
review.
we
also
have
the
rather
commonplace
case
in
which
a
defendant
doesn't
file
a
notice
of
appeal
at
all,
as
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
but
the
court
of
appeal
says,
you
know,
for
good
cause
we
are
going
to
let
you
file
this
appeal
late.
and
it's
quite
clear
in
that
scenario,
so
your
appeal
is
reinstated
there,
too,
because
you
were
20
days
late,
30
days
late
on
the
filing
deadline.
it's
quite
clear
and
i
think
agreed
in
all
of
those
situations
that,
while
congress
did
want
you
to
move
expeditiously,
the
question
is
move
expeditiously
from
when.
and
it's
from
the
state
court's
direct
review,
finishing
the
conclusion
of
direct
review.
and
we
know
that
congress
recognized
that
that
wouldn't
always
be
one
year
from
the
end
of
the
case
the
first
time
around
from
the
structure
of
(b),
(c),
and
(d);
and
the
fact
that
if
there
were
a
tie-breaker
at
all,
it
is
that
the
statute
shall
--
the
limitation
period
shall
run
from
the
latest
of
several
days.
so
congress
quite
clearly
contemplated
that
there
would
be
multiple
possible
start
dates.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
--
the
hypothetical,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
--
if
you
lose
your
post-conviction
application
for
it?
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
he
is
challenging
his
original
--
federal
habeas
corpus
is
reviewing
the
judgment
in
his
case.
he
has,
since
there
was
only
one
conclusion
of
direct
review
in
his
case,
one
year
measured
from
the
first
dismissal,
tolled
only
during
the
period
of
pending
post-conviction
application.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
he
is
challenging
the
fact
that
he
was
denied
a
direct
appeal,
which
is
a
challenge
to
his
actual
conviction.
that
is
a
constitutional
flaw
in
his
conviction.
and
so
it
runs
from
the
conclusion
of
the
direct
review,
not
from
anything
related
to
post-conviction
review.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
fact
that
the
state
post-conviction
court
did
not
remedy
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
on
direct
review
does
not
create
a
new
constitutional
violation.
the
constitutional
violation
in
your
hypothetical
arises
on
direct
review.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
don't
think
so.
and
if
i
could
just
explain
--
give
an
analogy.
say
he
could
make
the
same
allegation
about
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel.
you
can
always
try
and
recharacterize
your
claim
as
the
post-conviction
court
violated
my
constitutional
rights
by
not
vindicating
my
original
constitutional
rights,
my
right
to
constitutionally
effective
counsel
at
trial
or
on
appeal.
and
the
federal
habeas
courts
uniformly
reject
those
efforts
to
recharacterize.
the
constitutional
violation
arises
in
the
original
criminal
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
understand,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
body
of
cases
is
relatively
narrow
as
it
arises,
and
it
also
isn't
implicated
here.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you,
sir.
a
few
short
points.
justice
stevens,
if
later
on
you
have
an
opportunity
to
look
at
footnote
15
on
page
42
of
the
blue
brief,
we
cite
eight
cases,
and
there
are
more,
in
which
these
out-of-time
appeals
really
did
find
meritorious
claims.
and
i
--
so
i
don't
want
the
court
to
be
left
with
the
impression
that
this
is
much
ado
about
nothing.
the
rule
of
law
will
actually
be
quite
significant.
two
small
corrections
to
things
my
friend
inadvertently
said
or
impressions
he
may
have
inadvertently
left.
he
says
there
are
19
states
that
have
no
statute
of
limitations,
but
that
omits
the
very
many
of
those
states
that
apply
laches,
and
the
fact
that
the
state
of
texas
here
did
not
assert
the
untimeliness
of
the
state
post-conviction
proceeding
is
pretty
much
i
think
why
we
are
ultimately
here.
he
also
said
that
there
is
only
one
state
opinion
finding
laches,
as
if,
i
think,
to
create
the
impression
that
texas
courts
don't
take
laches
seriously.
most
of
these
are
disposed
of
without
opinions.
but
the
more
relevant
important
is
that
there
aren't
texas
state
opinions
rejecting
claims
of
laches.
what
the
texas
courts
have
made
is
that
the
texas
a.g.'s
office
has
to
assert
the
defense
of
laches,
as
is
true
everywhere
and
is
true
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
as
well.
the
final
two
points
i
wanted
to
make
are
about
(d)(
1)(b)
and
(d)(
2),
all
of
which,
i
think
honestly
reduced
to
justice
kennedy's
point,
is
that
the
relevant
provision
is
(d)(
1),
whatever
else
is
going
on
in
the
case.
but
justice
scalia
and
the
chief
justice
came
back
to
the
point
about
whether
this
is
an
impediment,
and
my
friend
kept
answering
it
is
state
action,
and
the
court
would
say,
but
is
it
an
impediment?
and
at
page
20
of
our
reply
brief
we
must
cite
eight
or
ten
cases,
three
of
which
notably
are
from
texas;
there
were
litigated
by
the
texas
attorney
general's
office,
that
make
it
clear
that
the
failure
to
give
the
notice
of
the
opinion
is
not
an
impediment
to
filing
post-conviction
review,
and
the
court
would
be
rewriting
a
lot
of
habeas
corpus
law
to
rule
for
the
state
of
texas
here.
