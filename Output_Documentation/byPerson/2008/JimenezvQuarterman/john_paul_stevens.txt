justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
that
on
the
underlying
merits
of
the
basic
claims,
that
each
--
his
lawyer
filed
an
anders
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
probably
not
a
very
--
he's
not
--
has
the
greatest
in
the
world
of
succeeding,
i
wouldn't
suppose.
isn't
this
characteristic
of
this
category
of
cases,
that
really
most
of
them
heard
are
pretty
frivolous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
strikes
me
about
the
case
is
we
are
fighting
about
the
limitations
and
whether
it
applies
and
so
forth;
you
probably
could
have
disposed
of
the
whole
litigation
a
lot
faster
by
just
looking
at
the
merits
for
about
ten
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
all
--
this
is
a
product
of
congress
trying
to
save
us
all
time.
