justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
background
of
this
case,
mr.
goldstein,
is
that
in
fact
he
didn't
know
the
first
time
that
his
appeal
had
been
dismissed.
he
didn't
know
that
his
lawyer
had
filed
an
anders
brief.
but
when
he
found
that
out,
he
waited
some
four
and
a
half
years.
so
why
isn't
the
--
texas
right
when
it
says
look
at
(b)
and
(d),
they
would
have
fit
his
case?
he
could
have
used
those
to
get
time
starting
from
the
date
that
he
found
out.
it
wouldn't
give
him
four
and
a
half
years.
but
why
--
you
say
we,
all
we
have
to
consider
is
(a);
you
said
that
in
answer
to
justice
kennedy.
but
why
shouldn't
we
say
that
either
(b)
or
(d)
fits
his
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
if
laches
is
something
that
the
texas
court
could
bring
up
on
its
own,
or
is
it
for
the
state
to
raise
or
not
as
it
chooses?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though,
as
in
this
case,
it
turned
out
he
found
out
within
a
year.
but
suppose
he
didn't
find
out
for
more
than
a
year;
that
is,
he
didn't
find
out
that
--
that
the
appeal
had
been
filed,
and
he
didn't
find
out
about
the
dismissal?
so
because
either
his
counsel
or
the
state
blundered,
he
is
out
in
the
cold,
and
he
can
never
present
his
directappeal
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein
just
explained
to
us
why
those
two
provisions,
the
(b)
and
(d)
would
not
work.
that
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
texas
could
--
and
texas
could
have
gone
into
the
state
court
and
said:
don't
give
him
the
direct
review;
he
waited
four
and
a
half
years
after
he
--
but
the
state
didn't
ask
for
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
texas
could
have
--
not
only,
that
don't
some
states
have
a
limitation
period
when
--
when
he
finds
out
that
his
appeal
has
been
dismissed,
without
notice
to
him,
aren't
there
some
states,
criminal
justice
systems,
that
say
from
the
date
that
you
had
knowledge,
you
have
x
days
to
file?
