justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
after
petitioner's
burglary
conviction
became
final
in
1996,
the
state
court
in
post-conviction
and
relief
proceedings
granted
petitioner
the
right
to
file
an
out-of-time
appeal.
petitioner
filed
the
out-of-time
appeal
and
his
conviction
was
affirmed.
petitioner
then
sought
state
habeas
relief
for
a
second
time.
after
the
state
court's
denied
relief,
petitioner
filed
a
federal
habeas
petition.
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996
(aedpa)
establishes
a
one-year
time
limitation
for
state
prisoners
to
file
a
federal
habeas
corpus
petition.
this
time,
limitation
runs
from
the
latest
of
four
dates.
the
date
that's
relevant
here
is
found
at
28
u.s.c.
2244(d)(1)(a)
and
that
is
the
date
on
which
the
judgment
became
final
by
the
conclusion
of
direct
review
or
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
seeking
such
review.
petitioner
argues
that
his
judgment
did
not
become
final
until
this
provision
--
under
this
provision
until
january
6,
2004
when
time
expired
for
seeking
review
in
this
court
of
his
out-of-time
appeal.
the
district
court
disagreed
and
dismissed
the
petition
as
untimely.
the
district
court
found
that
the
state
court's
decision
to
grant
petitioner
an
out-of-time
appeal
did
not
change
the
fact
that
petitioner's
judgment
had
first
become
final
in
1996.
the
fifth
circuit
then
denied
petitioner's
request
for
a
certificate
of
appealability.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
conclude
that
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
when
a
state
court
reopens
the
right
to
review
of
a
conviction
by
granting
the
right
to
file
an
out-of-time
direct
appeal,
the
conviction
is
no
longer
final
for
purposes
of
section
2244(d)(1)(a)
of
aedpa.
the
state
court
order
restores
the
pendency
of
the
direct
appeal
allowing
the
possibility
that
the
conviction
will
be
modified.
therefore,
petitioner's
judgment
was
not
final
for
purposes
of
aedpa
until
january
6,
2004
when
time
for
seeking
direct
review
of
the
decision
in
his
out-of-time
appeal
expired.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
