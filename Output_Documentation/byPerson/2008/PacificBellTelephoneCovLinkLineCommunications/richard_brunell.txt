mr.
richard
brunell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
think
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case
is
to
vacate
the
decision
below
and
to
remand
and
let
the
district
court
decide
whether
the
complaint
should
be
amended
or
not.
vacating
the
judgment
would
amount
to
a
dismissal
with
prejudice
of
the
price-squeeze
claim,
and,
therefore,
this
court
would
have
nothing
to
decide.
the
court
doesn't
need
to
reach
out
to
decide
the
vitality
of
alcoa,
the
question
of
which
is
not
even
presented
by
the
question
raised
in
the
--
in
the
cert
petition.
and
there
are
many
reasons
why
--
and
i
am
happy
to
address
why
--
alcoa
should
remain
good
law,
if
the
court
wishes
to
get
into
that.
however,
we
don't
think
it's
necessary.
on
the
specific
issue
here,
if
the
court
decides
not
to
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
wants
to
examine
the
correctness
of
the
ninth
circuit
judgment,
the
specific
issue
of
whether
the
absence
of
a
duty
to
deal
thereby
dooms
any
kind
of
claim
--
a
price-squeeze
claim
or
really
any
other
type
of
antitrust
claim,
including
a
predatory
pricing
claim,
if
the
regulators
can
address
the
issue,
we
think
that
is
--
that
is
the
case,
that
that
is
the
incorrect
view
of
the
law.
and,
indeed,
to
some
extent
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
existence
of
a
regulatory
remedy
is
not
sufficient
to
bar
a
price-squeeze
claim
because
there
is
no
exhaustion
requirement
under
the
antitrust
laws,
and
this
court's
decision
in
trinko,
as
the
solicitor
general
suggested,
when
it
looked
at
the
regulatory
remedies,
that
was
with
respect
to
expanding
section
2
enforcement
and
not
with
respect
to
traditional
antitrust
claims,
which
alcoa
certainly
is.
now,
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
the
duty
to
deal.
what
does
that
mean,
that
there's
no
duty
to
deal?
in
our
view--
mr.
richard
brunell
--in
our
view,
it
means
that
a
court
has
found
that
there's
no
liability
in
the
event
of
a
refusal
to
deal,
which
is
what
trinko
did.
and
one
has
to
ask
whether
the
rationale
for
finding
no
liability
for
refusal
to
deal
also
applies
to
a
predatory
--
excuse
me,
a
price-squeeze
claim.
mr.
richard
brunell
no,
i
mean
a
traditional
price-squeeze
claim
that
doesn't
have
to
meet
the
brooke
group
standard.
mr.
panner
suggested
that--
mr.
richard
brunell
--we've
listed
them
in
our
brief.
i
believe
that
9
out
of
the
12
circuits,
not
including
the
federal
circuit,
have
recognized
an
alcoa-type
price-squeeze
claim.
and
in
the
other
three
circuits,
district
courts
--
in
each
of
the
other
three
circuits,
district
courts
have
recognized
an
alcoa-type
claim.
mr.
richard
brunell
no,
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
and,
indeed,
our
brief
cites
an
eminent
professor,
john
vickers
at
oxford,
an
economist
who
supports
a
traditional
alcoa-type
claim,
that
is
a
claim
based
on
what
we've
called
"the
transfer
price
test",
where
one
looks
at
the
margin
between
the
retail
and
wholesale
prices
and
asks
whether
that's
sufficient
to
cover
the
monopolist's
downstream
costs.
professor
vickers--
mr.
richard
brunell
--i
believe
he
does,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
european
commission
also
recognizes
such
a
claim
in
the
presence
of
regulation.
i
believe
the
federal
trade
commission
recognizes
such
a
claim.
mr.
richard
brunell
why
do
we
need
to?
because
a
--
you
mean
in
the
absence
--
why
can't
regulation
handle
this
or
why
do
we
worry
about
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
a
price
squeeze?
mr.
richard
brunell
well,
in
this
case,
regulation
--
simply
the
--
the
regulation
that
is
referred
to
is
simply
the
prospect
of
the
complainant
going
to
the
federal
communications
commission
and
simply
asking
for
some
kind
of
post
hoc
relief,
as
opposed
to
a
situation
as
in
town
of
concord
or
in
trinko
where
the
regulation
at
issue
was
quite
extensive.
all
of
the
conduct
at
issue
in
trinko
was
heavily
regulated.
and
in
this
case,
we
have
wholesale
rates
that
are
lightly
regulated
and
retail
rates
that
are
completely
unregulated.
mr.
richard
brunell
well,
the
european
commission--
mr.
richard
brunell
--the
question
of
the
relationship
between
the
regulatory
authority
to
address
a
question
and
whether
an
antitrust
claim
exists
is
normally
decided
on
the
basis
of
implied
antitrust
immunity.
the
mere
existence
of
a
regulatory
remedy
is
insufficient
under
this
court's
precedents,
in
credit
suisse,
certainly,
for
--
for
having
implied
immunity.
mr.
richard
brunell
absent
the
regulatory
regime,
would
there
be
a
duty
to
deal?
would
the
court
have
found
--
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
may
well
have
voluntarily
dealt
with
the
respondents--
mr.
richard
brunell
--whether
there's
a
duty
to
deal
can
only
be
answered
by
asking
whether
a
violation
--
a
refusal
to
deal
would
constitute
an
antitrust
violation.
and
in
this
case,
had
--
had
there
been
no
required
dealing
and,
therefore,
no
dealing
whatsoever,
then
the
issue
of
antitrust
duty
to
deal
would
be
totally
academic.
furthermore--
mr.
richard
brunell
--well,
the
mere
fact
that
there's
a
regulatory
duty
to
deal
does
not
completely
oust
antitrust.
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
predatory
pricing
claim.
the
petitioner
--
the
respondent
injured
by
a
predatory-pricing
claim
could
also
go
to
the
fcc,
presumably.
and
we
don't
--
and
no
one
is
contending
that
the
--
that
a
predatory
pricing
claim
wouldn't
lie
and--
mr.
richard
brunell
--no.
i
--
i
don't
think
the
regulators
would
--
would
permit
predatory
pricing.
mr.
richard
brunell
there
certainly
is
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction,
which
arises
typically
when
the
agency
is
already
dealing
with
a
problem
and
not--
mr.
richard
brunell
--they
certainly
don't
approve
the
retail
pricing,
no.
the
retail
pricing
in
this
case
is
entirely
unregulated.
it
purports
to
be
in
a
competitive
market.
but
let
me
back
up
for
1
second.
the
--
the
regulatory
regime
here
is
quite
different
from
the
one
in
trinko.
in
--
in
trinko,
you
had
a
regulatory
duty
that
essentially
required
the
monopolist
to
cooperate
with
its
rivals
in
the
monopoly
market
in
order
to
dismantle
the
monopoly.
in
this
case,
you
have
a
regulation
that's
designed
to
ensure
that
the
monopolist
does
not
extend
its
monopoly
power
into
unregulated
competitive
markets.
and
so
the
--
surely,
the
regulators
focus
--
can
focus
on
the
wholesale
rates
and
ensure
in
this
case
that
the
rate
that
the
monopolist
charges
itself
is
the
same
as
the
rate
it
charges
its
rivals
and
--
with
the
object
of
ensuring
a
competitive
downstream
market.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
that
should
oust
antitrust
law.
the
regulators
may,
in
fact,
think
that
it's
important
to
have
antitrust
law
available
to
enforce
claims
in
order
for
them
to
cut
back
on
their
regulations.
and
indeed,
in
this
case,
when
the
--
when
at&t
sought
to
de-tariff
its
wholesale
offering,
the
regulators
referred
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
justifications
for
de-tariffing
would
be
that
the
antitrust
laws
would
be
available
in
case
there
were
a
problem.
so
the
--
the
relationship
between
antitrust
and
regulation
is
symbiotic
and
complementary.
and
we
would
suggest
that
in
this
case
the
mere
fact
that
the
district
court
determined
that
the
complaints
of
insufficient
cooperation
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
did
not
state
a
claim
for
refusal
to
deal
shouldn't
preclude
a
--
a
price-squeeze
claim
any
more
than
it
should
preclude
a
predatory
pricing
claim,
which
the
government
and
the
petitioners
seem
to
concede
would
still
lie.
now,
finally,
this
point
about
over-deterrence
and
whether
there's
any
evidence
that
any
monopolist
at
any
time
has
ever
been
deterred
from
engaging
in
legitimate
retail
price-cutting
or
efficient
vertical
integration,
i
would
submit
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
anywhere
in
the
literature,
no
empirical
evidence,
that
there
is
a
problem
of
overdeterrence.
and
had
there
been
a
problem
over
the
last
63
years
that
alcoa
has
existed,
one
would
think
it
wouldn't
be
too
hard
to
find
evidence
of
that.
there
is
no
evidence.
furthermore,
in
brooke
group
the
court
did
not
simply
rely
on
the
risk
of
over-deterrence
as
a
basis
for
holding
that
above-cost
price-cutting
was
not
actionable.
in
brooke
group
it
relied
on
two
factors:
the
fact
--
the
fear
that
making
above-cost
price-cutting
illegal
would
deter
legitimate
price-cutting,
but
also
the
fact
that
above-cost
price-cutting
would
not
eliminate
equally
efficient
rivals.
any
equally
efficient
rival
could
meet
an
above-cost
price.
the
price-squeeze
doctrine,
under
the
transfer
price
test,
protects
equally
efficient
downstream
rivals.
so
that
issue
is
quite
different.
the
deterrence
issue
is
--
is
quite
different
when
you
--
when
have
a
price
squeeze.
furthermore,
the
notion
that
a
monopolist
would
respond
to
a
price-squeeze
complaint
--
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
richard
brunell
the
notion
that
they
would
respond
to
a
price-squeeze
complaint
by
raising
their
retail
price,
rather
than
lowering
their
wholesale
price,
i
would
submit
is
certainly
as
belied
by
the
facts
of
the
alcoa
case
which
in
the
district
court
reflect
that
when
the
government
started
looking
into
the
price
squeeze
and
the
price
squeeze
was
ended,
it
was
ended
voluntarily
by
alcoa
lowering
its
wholesale
price,
not
raising
its
retail
price.
thank
you.
