justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
they
asked
to
have
the
ninth
circuit
decision
vacated.
they
didn't
ask
us
to
affirm
it.
they
said:
vacate
that
decision;
it
is
wrong.
justice

when
this
comes
up,
we
usually,
if
a
--
if
a
party
abandons
a
position
in
support
of
the
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
we
have
appointed
--
as
you
noted
in
your
brief,
we
have
appointed
a
friend
of
the
court
to
represent
the
position
of
the
circuit.
and
here
we
don't
have
that.
we
don't
have
anyone
that
we
have
appointed
and
said:
you
represent
the
position.
you
defend
the
position
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
what
you
just
said.
judge
gould
dissented.
he
said
the
ninth
circuit
majority
was
wrong.
and
you're
urging
us--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
accept
judge
gould's
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
can
we
do
that
without
saying
that
the
majority
was
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
ninth
circuit
had
a
precedent
that
it
thought
it
was
following.
was
it
anaheim?
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
isn't
it
important
if
we
--
you
think
that
they
were
wrong
and
we
agree
with
you,
that
we
get
--
not
just
vacate
but
say:
you
were
wrong
on
the
law;
you
were
wrong
in
this
case,
and
you
were
wrong
in
anaheim.
and
then
the
ninth
circuit
will
not
follow
those
decisions
anymore.
