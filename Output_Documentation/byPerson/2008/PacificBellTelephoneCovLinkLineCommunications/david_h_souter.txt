justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be
the
assumption
on
this
case,
but
that
may
not
be
the
assumption
on
the
next
case.
and
i
understood
you
to
be
arguing
that
you
wanted
us
to
hold
that
at
--
well,
you
wanted
us
to
hold
whether
we
are
dealing
with
a
regulatory
case
or
in
justice
breyer's
example,
where
there
is
--
where
there
is
no
independent
regulation,
that
the
greater
includes
the
lesser;
that
(a)
there
is
no
duty
to
deal
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
obligation
that
can
be
violated
under
the
antitrust
laws
by
a
price
squeeze
that
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
predatory
pricing.
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
best
way
to
do
that
is
to
start
with
a
yes
or
no
answer
----
[laughter]
--so
i
know--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
i
know
where
you're
going.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
what
i
think
we're
trying
to
get
at
is,
should
we
foresee
a
situation,
with
or
without
the
regulatory
participation
of
something
like
the
agency
here,
in
which
there
would
be
a
duty
to
deal,
which
would
support
a
price-squeeze
theory
that
did
not
amount
to
predatory
pricing?
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect
to
your
argument
that
there's
going
to
be
an
upstream
disincentive
to
investment
in
the
monopolist
if
we
do
not
come
up
with
a
clear
rule
that
you
want,
are
we
at
a
stage
or
is
the
fashion
of
economics
at
a
stage
where
we
can
say
that
there
is
a
clear
consensus
supporting
your
argument?
and
if
the
answer
is
no,
then
isn't
the
only
sensible
thing
for
this
court
to
do
to
leave
it
to
rule
of
reason?
justice
david
h.
souter
for
the
--
for
the
reasons
you
gave,
in
effect,
the
investment
disincentive
reason?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that,
in
effect,
uncontested
within
the
profession
except
--
you
know,
except
at
the
margins?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
i
follow
the
argument.
the
trouble
that
i
have
is
i
don't
know
whether,
in
practical
terms,
that
argument
is
really
a
significant
argument
or
not.
i
don't
know
what's
going
on
out
there.
and
unless
we
reach
the
point
in
which,
in
effect,
the
economic
literature
makes
this
a
kind
of
slam-dunk
decision,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
only
sensible
thing
for
a
court
to
do
is
leave
it
to
rule
of
reason
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
want
to
interrupt
your
answer.
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
the
case
that
if,
in
effect,
we
--
we
refuse
to
come
down
with
a
--
the
kind
of
blanket
answer,
with
a
rule
that
you
want,
that
the
parties
here
can
go
out
--
the
complaining
party
here
can
go
back
to
the
fcc
and
say
there's
something
wrong
with
your
wholesale
pricing
order;
look
what's
happening;
and
the
fcc
may
adjust
the
wholesale
pricing
order
as
a
result
of
that?
and
if
that
is
true,
if
they
can
do
that,
and
the
fcc
can
act,
isn't
that
a
good
reason
for
us
not
to
be
developing
new
antitrust
doctrine,
if
there's
no
need
of
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
--
you're
certainly
asking
us
to
--
at
the
very
least,
to
clarify
the
significance
of
alcoa.
you're
--
you're
asking
for
an
articulation
of
something
--
of
the
significance
of
alcoa
today,
which
we
have
not
done.
so
in
that
sense
you
are
asking
for
something
more
than
we've
got
on
the
books
now;
and
my
question
is,
if
the
agency
in
effect
can
deal
with
--
with
--
with
what
the
--
the
monopolist
is
concerned
with,
and
what
the
entrant
is
concerned
with,
why
do
we
have
to
take
--
why
is
it
wise
for
us
to
take
the
step
of
making
or
clarifying
new
antitrust
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
are
saying
in
practical
terms
that
if
there
is
a
squeeze,
it
is
highly
unlikely
it's
going
to
be
anything
but
a
brooke
group
kind
of
squeeze,
and
therefore
keep
it
simple.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
either
you
or
anybody
else
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
he
support
--
pardon
me?
i
thought
somebody
else
was
--
does
he
support
recognition
of
that
claim
in
the
circumstances
in
which
there
was
regulatory
involvement
like
the
fcc
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
we
--
why
do
we
need
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
can't
regulation
handle
it?
