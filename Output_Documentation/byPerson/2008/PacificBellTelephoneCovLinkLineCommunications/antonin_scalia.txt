would
that
lie
here
first?
i
mean,
you
don't
think
--
you
don't
think
that
the
regulatory
agency
would
be
acting
properly
if
it
--
if
it
prescribed
a
price
that
was
predatory
or
allowed
the
charge
of
a
price
that
was
predatory,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
wouldn't
permit
it.
then
--
then
is
there
--
is
there
no
such
thing
as
primary
agency
responsibility
to
take
care
of
that
problem,
rather
than
rushing
into
a
court
and
take
care
of
it
through
the
--
through
the
sherman
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
are
dealing
with
the
problem
there.
they're
--
they're
decreeing
the
price
that
can
be
charged,
aren't
they?
don't
they
have
to
approve
the
pricing?
