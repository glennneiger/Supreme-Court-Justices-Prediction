justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
--
so
there's
regulation
involved
there.
i
mean,
suppose
you
had
no
regulation
at
all
involved.
why
couldn't
you
have
a
monopolist
at
the
primary
stage,
say,
ingot,
and
what
that
monopolist
wants
to
do
is
to
extend
its
power
into
the
secondary
stage,
say,
fabrication,
in
order
to
make
it
less
likely
that
there
will
be
a
new
entry
that
would
attack
its
primary
monopoly?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
--
suppose
you
had
those
circumstances.
perhaps
they'd
be
rare,
but
if
you
had
them,
wouldn't
that
set
forth
a
section
2
violation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
it
--
i
mean,
now
maybe
you
can
get
me
off
what
i
am
thinking,
but
now
it
sounds
that
the
answer
to
justice
stevens's
question
is
yes.
now,
i
have,
yes,
overruled
judge
hand's
opinion
in
alcoa.
i've
always
thought
there
were
circumstances,
whether
true
of
alcoa
or
not,
where
that
did
make
out
the
claim,
namely,
the
one
i
suggested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
quite
a
different
matter
if,
in
fact,
the
person
who
is
injured,
namely,
the
--
the
fabricator
who
is
complaining,
has
a
place
to
go,
such
as
the
fcc
or
the
alcoa
regulatory
agency,
because
under
those
circumstances,
he
has
a
place
to
complain
that
these
prices
are
out
of
line.
but
if
there's
no
place
to
go,
well,
i'm
suddenly
--
i'm
a
little
hesitant
to
overturn
alcoa
under
those
circumstances,
and
the
reason
the
duty
to
deal
doesn't
deal
with
it
is
we
could
come
into
an
existing
world
where,
duty
or
no
duty,
there
have
been
independent
fabricators
who
for
a
long
time
have
bought
their
ingot
from
this
monopolist.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
would
say
that
shouldn't
be
the
law.
the
reason
it
shouldn't
be
the
law
is
because
that
ingot
may,
by
either
withdrawing
or,
in
fact,
raising
his
price
way
above
a
competitive
level
and
charging
--
you
know,
just
no
room
to
remain
in
business,
is
trying
to
drive
out
possible
new
entrants
into
the
ingot
stage
of
the
business.
and
the
fabricators
are
a-number
one
out
there
as
possible
--
possibilities
to
break
down
the
monopolist
in
ingot.
and
if
that
is
the
motive,
as
shown
by
the
behavior,
there
should
be
a
section
2
claim.
if
you
want
to
argue
that
straight
on
the
merits,
what's
the
answer
to
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
out
of
curiosity,
is
there
a
place
where,
in
this
case,
the
plaintiffs
could
go,
a
place
which
has
the
label
"regulator"
under
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
person
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
we
needn't
reach
this
issue
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
--
why
can't
we
just
say
trinko
was
a
case,
as
is
this
case,
where
there
is
a
regulator?
so,
in
fact,
if
you,
mr.
plaintiff,
are
upset
about
this,
and
feel
you
are
being
very
badly
treated
and
squeezed
out
under
circumstances
where
competition
might
be
hurt
as
a
result,
then
you
go
to
the
commission,
and
you
say:
this
is
an
unreasonable
price.
all
right?
now,
i
thought
trinko
was
a
case
where
that
was
involved.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
--
it
--
it
said
the
issue
in
that
case
was
a
duty
to
deal.
that's
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
and
it
was
about
aspen,
and
whether
you
had
a
duty
to
deal.
and
the
court
said
no,
you
don't
have
a
special
duty
to
deal.
here
we
are
dealing
with
quite
a
different
thing.
we
are
dealing
with
someone
who
has
chosen
to
deal
in
the
past,
and
they
are
setting
a
price
such
that
the
plaintiff
thinks
he
is
being
squeezed
out.
now,
i
can't
find
anything
in
trinko
that
tells
me
i
can't
say,
we're
at
least
not
worried
about
this
where
there
is
a
regulator
you
can
go
and
complain
to.
and
if
that's
so,
i
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
judge
hand
is
right
or
wrong.
what's
wrong
with
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
can
we
write
this
following
--
we
say:
in
the
district
court,
as
of
this
moment,
there
is
no
complaint
that
alleges
the
price-squeeze
theory
of
the
majority
of
the
ninth
circuit.
there
is
a
complaint
that
alleges
a
price
theory
under
brooke
--
a
predatory
pricing
under
brooke
group.
that
is
what
is
there.
nothing
else
is
there.
therefore,
that
issue
which
the
ninth
circuit
decided
has
no
bearing
on
this
case.
we
therefore
vacate
their
decision,
leaving
it
up
to
the
district
court
to
proceed
as
it
believes
appropriate
under
the
law
with
the
brooke
group
claim?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
a
possible
thing
to
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes
or
no,
please.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
yes,
we
could
do
that,
or
no--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
we
could?
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we'd
vacate.
you'd
be
in
favor
of
vacating
their
decision?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
couldn't
you
--
why
wouldn't
you
--
couldn't
you
go
to
the
fcc
or
the
other
regulator
and
say:
regulator,
they
are
selling
me
this
widget
or
line
at
a
dollar.
all
right?
that's
considerably
higher
than
their
costs
of
producing
it,
and,
in
addition
to
that,
they
sell
the
same
service
i
do
for
$1.20,
even
though
it
costs
me
or
would
cost
any
human
being
at
least
60
cents
to
provide
that
added
service.
so
we
are
asking
you
to
tell
them
that
if
they
continue
to
sell
it
at
$1.20,
they
lower
their
wholesale
price
to
us
so
that
we
only
have
to
pay
at
most
80
cents,
or
whatever
the
right
number
is
there.
i
mean,
they
have
someone
to
complain
to.
they
could
make
the
same
complaint.
i'm
quite
surprised
that
vickers
has
written
that
under
the
circumstances
i've
outlined
that
there
is
a
valid
price-squeeze
antitrust
claim
or
that
the
british
commission
has
held
that.
i'd
be
very
interested
to
know
the
citation
of
that.
because
he
may
have
done.
i
don't
read
everything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
the
european
commission.
they
have
done
all
kinds
of
things.
i
am
saying
the
--
the
----
[laughter]
i
am
saying
the
british
monopolies
and
restrictive
practices
commission
of
which
vickers
was
the
head.
and
i
agree
with
you
--
he's
very
knowledgeable.
i
just
would
be
surprised
if
he
had
written
contrary
to
what
i
just
said
in
that
example,
but
i
am
often
surprised
and
willing
to
read
it.
