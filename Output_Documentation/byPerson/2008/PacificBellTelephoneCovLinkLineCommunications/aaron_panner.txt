mr.
aaron
panner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
should
reverse
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
because
it
conflicts
with
this
court's
holding
in
trinko
and
is
contrary
to
principles
regarding
unilateral
pricing
decisions
as
explained
in
brooke
group
and
elsewhere.
mr.
aaron
panner
well,
your
honor,
it's
--
it
is
correct,
as
this
court
observed
in
roberts,
that
the
respondents'
agreement
that
the
legal
position
of
the
court
below
is
incorrect
certainly
should
provide
this
court
great
comfort
in
reversing
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
and,
indeed,
a
decision
on
the
merits
here
is
important
because
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
harmful
to
consumers,
deterring
beneficial
price
cuts
and
sufficient
partial
vertical
integration.
and
it--
mr.
aaron
panner
--no,
your
honor.
the
parties'
agreement
on
a
point
of
law
does
not
deprive
this
court
of
jurisdiction
in
any
way,
and
the
parties
remain
adverse
in
this
case.
the
respondents
continue
to
pursue
a
section
2
claim
and
the
same
intent
to
--
evidently
intend
to
pursue
the
same
relief.
mr.
aaron
panner
well,
in
laidlaw
the
court
said
that
it
was
for
a
particular
type
of
relief
that
the
plaintiff
had
to
establish
standing,
but
that's
not
at
issue
here.
the
respondents
continue
to
pursue
a
section
2
claim
and
pursue,
evidently,
the
same
type
of
relief
based
on
the
same
course
of
conduct.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
respondents,
while
conceding
that
the
position
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
incorrect,
have
not
clearly
stated
that
they
would
not
take
advantage
of
a
decision
by
this
court
affirming
the
ninth
circuit.
and
i
think
that
that's
important,
because
there
really
would
be
no
reason
for
these
respondents
to
say
that
if
for
whatever
reason
the
court
decided
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
right,
that
they
would
not
go
ahead
and
take
advantage
of
that--
mr.
aaron
panner
--that
is
right,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
point
is
that
if
this
court
were
to
disagree
--
if
the
--
for
example,
it's
well
established
that
the
solicitor
general's
confession
of
error,
for
example,
or
a
state
attorney
general's
confession
of
error
does
not
bind
this
court.
indeed,
a
party's
position
with
respect
to
the
proper
disposition
of
a
case
never
binds
the
court.
so
the
court
certainly
has
the
power
to
say,
now
that
the
case
is
properly
before
it:
we
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
got
it
right.
obviously,
we
don't
think
that
that's
what
we
think
the
court
should
say;
but,
given
that
circumstance,
if
the
court,
for
whatever
reason,
were
to
affirm
the
ninth
circuit,
there
would
be
nothing
that
would
bar
the
respondents
from
taking
advantage
of
that.
even
though
they
have
said
that
that's
a
legal
error,
if
that
were
the
established
law,
there
would
be
no
reason
for
them
not
to
pursue
it.
and
i
think
that
that's
relevant,
again,
to
the
question
whether
the
parties
remain
adverse
for
article
iii
purposes.
as
a
jurisdictional
issue,
the
adversity
of
the
parties
with
respect
even
to
the
section
2
claim,
even
if
they
intended
to
pursue
a
different
legal
theory,
is
sufficient.
but
the
point
i
am
making
is
simply
to
illustrate
that
adversity
even
with
respect
to
the
narrow
legal
issue
remains,
even
though
they
are
not
contesting
the
proper
--
the
proper
disposition
of
that
legal
issue.
and--
mr.
aaron
panner
--well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
there
is
--
there
is
amicus
arguing
before
the
court
today
defending
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
and
there
were
two
amicus
briefs
filed
in
support
of
that.
had
those
not
been
filed,
of
course
the
court
could
have
sought
additional
help.
but
the
positions
--
the
arguments
in
favor
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
have
been
put
forward
in
those
amicus
briefs,
and
indeed
counsel
will
be
arguing
in
defense
of
the
ninth
circuit's
position
today.
and
i
think
it's
--
i
think
the
jurisdictional
issue
is
answered
really
by
your
question.
that
is
to
say,
the
fact
that
the
court
can
appoint
an
amicus
in
this
circumstance
to
defend
a
judgment
shows
that
this
court
retains
article
iii
jurisdiction.
and
it's
very
important
in
this
case
for
the
court
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
decision
and
clearly
to
rule
that
there
is
no
independent
price-squeeze
theory
under
section
2,
because
recognition
of
such
a
theory,
as
in
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
is
very
harmful
to
consumers
because--
mr.
aaron
panner
--well,
i
think
it
could,
your
honor.
in
their
brief,
they
refer
to
the
possibility
that
the
wholesale
price
that
was
charged
could
be
in
some
way
a
proxy
for
cost
and
this
court
clearly
stating
that
there's
a
--
a
different
issue
as
to
whether
a
single
economic
unit
is
charging
prices
below
cost,
that
wholesale
prices
that
may
be
charged
are
not
an
appropriate
proxy.
but
i
--
and
so,
in
that
respect,
i
think
that
a
clear
declaration
with
respect
to
what
is
required
--
i
guess
the
distinction
between
the
predatory-pricing
theory
of
liability
and
a
--
and
a
price-squeeze
claim
as
recognized
by
the
ninth
circuit
could
--
could
have
an
impact.
mr.
aaron
panner
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
i
am
challenging
judge
hand's
reasoning
in
alcoa.
i
think
that
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
there
would
never
be
a
situation
in
which
a
price
squeeze,
that
is,
the
--
an
insufficient
margin
between
wholesale
and
retail
prices
to
allow
a
competitor
to
compete
--
that
that
course
of
conduct
could
never
support
a
claim
under
section
2,
but
the
basis
for
the
claim
would
have
to
be
that
there
was
a
duty
to
deal
--
or
a
duty
to
deal
under
section
2,
an
antitrust
duty
to
deal,
that
was
effectively
being
evaded
through
that
sort
of
pricing
conduct.
but
i
think
that
the--
mr.
aaron
panner
--well,
i
think
that
the
alcoa
case
was
wrongly
decided,
your
honor,
and
in
several
respects.
the
critical
point
about
--
the
first
point
about
alcoa
is
that
the
conduct
that
was
at
issue
was
said
to
be
unlawful
because
it
was
an
abuse
of
the
power
in
the
ingot
market
and
not
monopolization
of
the
downstream
market
in
sheet.
and
so
what
--
what
judge
hand
said
was
that
that
was
unlawful.
he
expressed
some
doubt
about
whether
it
was
appropriate
to
treat
it
as
an
independent
basis
for
--
or
an
independent
wrong
under
section
2.
but
the
notion
that
the
abuse
--
that
charging
too
high
a
price
at
the
wholesale
level
could
be
an
independent
section
2
wrong
is
quite
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
said
in
--
in
--
most
recently
in
trinko
where
it
recognized--
mr.
aaron
panner
--well--
mr.
aaron
panner
--it
--
it
--
it
wouldn't,
your
honor,
for
the
following
reason:
that
i
think
it
is
--
it
is
true
that
the
--
the
key
point
is
that
the
basis
upon
which
the
question
--
the
question
presented
has
been
granted
and
upon
which
the
analysis
has
to
turn
is
that
there
is
no
duty
to
deal
at
all
at
the
wholesale
level.
so
that
the
ingot
monopolist
has
no
obligation
to
provide
the
ingot
to
a
downstream
rival.
and
that
judgment
is
a
judgment
that
it
is
not
worth
protecting
downstream
dependent
competitors
in
order
to
promote
the
competitive
process.
mr.
aaron
panner
well,
justice
souter,
let
me
try
to
be
clear
about
the
relationship.
there
is
no--
mr.
aaron
panner
--i
think
that
that's
not--
mr.
aaron
panner
--thank
you,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
that's
not
precisely
our
position.
mr.
aaron
panner
our
position
is
that
in
the
absence
of
a
duty
to
deal,
one
does
not
look
at
an
allegation
of
insufficient
margin
as
a
potential
section
claim.
mr.
aaron
panner
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
has
to
anticipate
that.
i
think
what
the
court
should
say
is
that
there
are
narrow
circumstances
as
recognized
in
trinko,
where
there
may
be
a
duty
to
deal
under
section
2.
and
in
that
circumstance,
there
may
be
conduct
that
constitutes
a
refusal
to
deal,
even
a
constructive
refusal
to
deal.
there's
really
--
to
give
a
simple
example,
if
a
widget
--
you
know,
if
the
downstream
product
costs
$10
and
a
widget
is
made
available
for
a
million
dollars,
that
is
not
really
dealing
at
all.
but
the
point
is
that
the
section
--
the
price-squeeze
piece
of
the
allegation
really
does
not
add
to
the
underlying
question
of
what
is
the
section
2
duty
that
needs
to
be
enforced.
mr.
aaron
panner
well--
mr.
aaron
panner
--well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
answer
to
that
is
two-fold.
first
of
all,
because
there
is
no
duty
to
deal,
by
assumption
the
producer
of
ingot,
the
wholesale
--
the
alleged
wholesale
monopolist,
has
the
privilege
to
withdraw
the
supply
of
that--
mr.
aaron
panner
--i
think
the
answer
to
that
argument,
your
honor,
is
the
one
that
trinko
offers,
which
is
that
it
is
very
important
in
establishing
antitrust
rules
to
recognize
the
incentives
that
those
rules
will
create
for
investment
and
for
innovation.
if
the
monopolist
is
forced
to
share
the
benefit
of
the
monopoly
with
downstream
rivals
on
the
basis
there
is
potential
entry,
that
is
going
to
be
a
significant
disincentive
to
investment
and
innovation
at
the
upstream
level.
and
the
establishment
of
clear
rules,
ones
that
recognize
that,
in
the
general
run
of
cases,
the
--
there
is
not
going
to
be
harm
and
that
recognizes
that
the
very
scrutiny
of
that
conduct
will
deter
beneficial
conduct
and
beneficial
innovation,
beneficial
investment
by
the
upstream
monopolist,
that
recognition
is
the
one
that
argues
in
favor
of
saying,
in
the
absence
of
a
duty
to
deal,
where
the
wholesale
input
could
be
withdrawn
from
the
market
and
where,
therefore,
the
incremental
harm
from
a
price
squeeze
is
really
quite
hard
to
identify,
but
in
that
circumstance
it
is
inappropriate
to
recognize
any
sort
of
a
duty
under
section
2--
mr.
aaron
panner
--yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
panner
the
federal
communications
commission.
mr.
aaron
panner
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
significance
of
regulation
here
is
--
is
not
necessary.
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
that
is
a
factor
that
the
court
could
allow
to
be
placed
somehow
on
the
--
on
the
scale.
but
the
analysis
that
took
place
in
trinko
was,
first
of
all,
to
look,
of
course,
at
whether
there
was
an
antitrust
duty
there
at
all
and
then
whether
to
extend
it
in
light
of
the
regulatory
scheme
that
existed.
and
so,
in
this
case,
even
in
the
absence
of
regulation,
there
should
be
no
duty
under
section
2.
mr.
aaron
panner
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
a
consensus
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
all
of
the
scholarly
literature
that
was
cited
by
the
american
antitrust
institute,
there
wasn't
anyone
who
supported
--
there
was
no
scholar
who
supported
the
recognition
of
a
price-squeeze
claim
under
section
2.
i
do
think
that--
mr.
aaron
panner
--well,
i
think
the
scholarly
literature
that
explains
that
recognition
of
price-squeeze
duty
would
be
harmful
does
indeed
rely
on
the
sorts
of
--
of
reasons
that
i--
mr.
aaron
panner
--i
would
assume
that
as
--
as
in
any
academic
discipline,
there
are
those
who
would
try
to
find
counterexamples.
but
i
think
that
the
point
there
that's
important
and
one
that,
for
example,
professor
carlton
stresses
in
his
article
and
that
has
been
stressed
another
scholarly
work
is
that
the
search
for
the
rare
case
itself
can
cause
very
grave
harm
by
deterring
conduct
that
is
harmful.
mr.
aaron
panner
well,
i
think
that
the
brooke
--
the
brooke
group
decision
and
the
reasoning
behind
that
and
then
as
reaffirmed
in
weyerhauser
explains
the
answer
to
that,
justice
souter,
which
is
that
there
are
a
certain
kind
of
conduct
where
it
is
possible
to
create
a
model
where
there
would
be
some
negative
--
negative
consequences
of
the
conduct,
but
that
the
very
search
for
it
risks
deterring
conduct
that
is
of
obvious
benefit
to
the
consumers.
and
that's
true
here.
recognition
of
an
independent
price-squeeze
duty
would
deter
retail
price
reductions
that
are
immediately
beneficial
to
consumers,
and
it
deters
entry
into
the
downstream
market
by
a
vertically
--
by
a
wholesale
monopolist
who
may
then
encounter
a
duty
to
protect
downstream
rivals;
and,
of
course,
it
will
deter
voluntary
dealing.
and
i
think
that
that
--
you
know,
discussions
with
my
client
reflect
that
this
is
a
real
effect,
that
they
are
on
the
margin.
the
concern
about
the
potential
for
litigation
makes
investment
and
certainly
innovations
not
worth
the
gamble.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
aaron
panner
i
have
two
points
i'd
like
to
make:
first
of
all,
i
think
--
in
agreement
with
justice
breyer
and
justice
kennedy
and
others,
i
do
think
that
the
presence
of
a
regulatory
remedy
here
is
a
critical
factor
arguing
in
favor
of
reversal
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
the
second
point
that
i
really
want
to
make
is
the
importance
of
clear
rules.
in
the
antitrust
context
where
we
are
talking
about
a
system
of
rules
that's
going
to
govern
decisionmaking
by
businesses
where
most
of
those
decisions
are
never
going
to
lead
to
litigation,
are
never
going
to
come
before
the
courts,
it
is
critically
important
to
have
clear
rules
that
avoid
deterring
harmful
--
that
avoid
deterring
beneficial
conduct,
that
avoid
having
the
rules
themselves
harm
consumers.
i
think
that
was
the
point
that
justice
alito
and
justice
ginsburg
were
getting
at
in
the
questioning.
it
is
critical
to
adopt
a
decision
on
the
merits
explaining
why
the
ninth
circuit's
price-squeeze
decision
--
not
just
here,
but
in
the
prior
decision,
in
city
of
anaheim
--
is
incorrect
and
inconsistent
with
this
court's
precedents.
and,
more
broadly,
it's
critical
to
have
a
clear
rule
stating
that
in
the
absence
of
a
duty
to
deal,
an
allegation
of
price
squeeze
--
it
doesn't
state
a
claim.
and
i
think
that
it's
also
--
would
be
very
valuable
to
say
that
the
complaint
that
was
before
the
district
court
and
the
amended
complaint,
at
a
minimum
as
supplying
one
version
of
the
facts
that
might
try
to
be
elaborated,
fail
to
state
a
claim
under
this
court's
precedents.
the
clear
gravamen
of
that
complaint,
indeed
the
explicit
gravamen
of
that
complaint,
was
that
the
margin
between
the
wholesale
price
and
the
retail
price
was
insufficient.
and--
