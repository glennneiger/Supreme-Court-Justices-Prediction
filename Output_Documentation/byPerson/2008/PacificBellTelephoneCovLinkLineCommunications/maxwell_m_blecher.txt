mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
don't
have
a
white
flag
and
i
don't
think
we
particularly
have
given
up,
but
let
me
start
by
suggesting
that
you
don't
need
to
decide
the
vitality
of
alcoa.
i
think
you
need
to
vacate
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
not
because
it's
erroneous,
but
because
it's
incomplete,
and
send
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
to
consider
judge
gould's
suggestion
that
we
file
an
amended
complaint.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
not--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--yes.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
there's
a
difference
between
being
wrong
and
being
incomplete.
the
ninth
circuit
decision
responded
to
a
very
narrow
question
certified
by
the
district
judge,
which
was
whether
or
not
price
squeeze
taken
as
a
generic
violation
was
subsumed
or
not
subsumed
by
the
trinko
decision.
it
answered
that
question
correctly,
but
in
doing
that,
it
did
not
consider
whether
or
not
price
squeeze
survived
--
the
living
margin
part
of
price
squeeze
survived
brooke.
and
to
that
extent,
judge
gould
picked
up
the
--
the
--
the
argument
and
said,
in
effect,
especially
in
a
regulated
industry
where
the
wholesale
price
is
--
is
regulated,
the
offense
of
price
squeeze
becomes
predatory
pricing,
just
as
in
a
primary
line
robinson-patman
case,
the
offense
becomes
predatory
pricing.
there
is
no
more
robinson-patman
primary
line
law.
it's
--
it's
--
like
it
or
not
--
i'm
not
saying
we
like
it.
i'm
not
saying
we
agree
with
it.
but
the
state
of
the
law
is
that
when
you
are
challenging
a
monopolist
price
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
brooke
and
its
predecessors
determine
the
legality
of
the
conduct.
and
that's
--
and
that's
what
we
are
recognizing
here.
now,
understand
that
when
the
issue
was
framed
to
the
ninth
circuit,
the
district
judge,
in
a
footnote,
said
he
thought
that
they
ought
to
consider
the
brooke
issue,
but
he
did
not
decide
that
question,
and
he
did
not
certify
it.
so
when
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--partly,
justice
kennedy.
what
--
in
part
what
we
said
was--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--well,
i
question
whether
that's
what
they
held.
i
view
what
they
did
is
answer
a
question:
does
a
pure
price
squeeze
get
subsumed
by
trinko
as
it
involves
the
question
that
we
heard
articulated,
the
duty
to
deal?
now--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--it's
consistent,
but
it
didn't
say,
we
endorse
alcoa,
and
it
didn't
say
we
require
a
--
predatory
pricing.
it
was
silent
on
the
elements
of
the
offense
of
a
price
squeeze.
it
answered
this
very
narrow
question:
does
price
squeeze
generically
--
is
it
an
existing
kind
of
antitrust
violation
that's
not
subsumed
by
the
trinko
ruling?
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
and
that's
all
they
were
deciding.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
a
non-predatory--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--a
--
a
non-predatory
price
squeeze
case.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
no.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
no.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
am
very
content
to
go
back
to
file
an
amended
complaint
purely
under
brooke
so
there's
no
gamesmanship.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
and
we
would--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--yes.
we
have
below-cost
pricing.
i
have
no
concern
about
that
because,
unlike
what
mr.
panner
told
you,
this
is
not
proxy
pricing.
this
is
a
case
in
which
at&t
is
mandated
by
the
fcc
to
sell
the
dsl
transport
to
itself,
to
its
own
affiliate,
and
to
outside
independent
companies
like
the
plaintiffs
at
the
same
price.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
more
or
less
irrelevant.
only
--
it
only
sets
the
benchmark
for
the
cost
that
the
retail
affiliate
is
selling
below.
there
--
there
is
no
question
the
retail
affiliate,
in
many
of
the
time
periods
covered
by
the
complaint,
sold
below
--
just
the
dsl
transport;
and
in
addition
to
that,
they
threw
in
a
modem,
installation,
and
online
services.
so,
if
you
put
those
into
the
cost
bundle,
they
will
be
below
cost
for
the
--
substantially
the
entire
damage
period
that
we
are
complaining
about.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
and
this
is
not--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--yes,
directly,
but
we
did
have--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--a
predatory
pricing--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--no--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--see
--
see,
justice
kennedy,
you
granted
certiorari
and
agreed
to
review
a
decision
that
was
essentially
moot,
because
the
complaint
that
you're
talking
about
in
this
case
has
been
superseded.
judge
wilson
said
it
was
superseded
by
a
complaint
charging
predatory
pricing,
and
he
said,
generously
construed,
you
have
charged
predatory
pricing,
and
let's
go
forward.
judge
gould
said
he
didn't
think
the
complaint
under
twombly's
standards,
which
intervened,
satisfied
the
brooke
standard,
and
so
he
said--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
in
--
in
the
opposition,
that's
correct.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
well,
i
think
what
you
are
overlooking,
though,
is
when
we
went
to
the
ninth
circuit,
we
endorsed
judge
wilson's
suggestion
that
they
decide
the
brooke
issue,
so
that,
when
we
went
back,
we'd
have
guidance
as
to
what
the
appropriate
standard
was.
they
elected
not
to
deal
with
either
alcoa
or
brooke.
they
just
decided
the
very
narrow
question
he
certified.
in
the
ninth
circuit,
at&t
said,
to
the
ninth
circuit,
don't
reach
the
brooke
issue;
you
don't
need
to
reach
the
brooke
issue
to
decide
this
case,
even
though
the
complaint
you
are
ruling
on
has
been
superseded
by
an
allegation
in
an
amended
complaint
that
states
a
brooke
violation,
or
purported
to
or
attempted
to
state
a
brooke
violation.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
think--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--and
--
and--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--it
avoids
the
need
to--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--yes.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes,
you
can.
that's
what
we're
suggesting--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--if
you
don't
need
to
reach
alcoa
here,
because
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
endorse
alcoa.
it
just
didn't
reach
that
question.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
it
was
allowed.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
judge
wilson
ruled
that
it
was
a
--
quote,
"generously
construed",
we
stated
a
brooke
claim,
and
he
would
review
it
again
at
summary
judgment
stage.
judge
gould
disagreed
with
that,
and
he
said,
if
you
want
to
state
a
brooke
claim,
you
should
go
back
and
amend
the
complaint
and
do
it.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
that
certainly
is
an
option.
i
think
it
would
be
more
appropriate
to
vacate
it
because
i
don't
consider
that
they
did
a
direct
frontal
assault
on
brooke.
they
didn't
consider
brooke
because
at&t
suggested
that
they
didn't
need
to
reach
it.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes.
it
would
be--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--well,
that's
if
you
want
to
cross
the
rubicon
and
decide
that
there
can
only
be
a
price-squeeze
claim
if
the
price
is
predatory.
and
you
may
want
to
get
there.
i'm
saying
you
don't
need
to
get
there
here.
you
could
simply
say
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
i
think,
correctly
decided
the
very
narrow
question
that
was
presented
by
the
certification
order.
they
abided
at&t's
suggestion
not
to
go
outside
that
order,
and,
therefore,
their
decision
can
be
viewed
as
incomplete
because
they
didn't
go
on
to
discuss
what
the
elements
of
a
price-squeeze
claim
were.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
correct.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
this
is
not
a
case
where
we
are
confronting
you
with
the
--
with
the
necessity
of
deciding
the
vitality
of
alcoa.
you
--
obviously,
you
could
do
that--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--i
am
going
to
file
an
amended
complaint
that
will
be
limited
entirely
to
a
brooke
predatory
pricing
claim.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
and
we
are
very
comfortable
with
that.
the
answer
is
yes,
and
we
are
comfortable
with
that.
so
we
haven't
given
up.
we've
lived
to
fight
another
day
on
another
field.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
the
answer
to
that,
justice
alito,
i
think
is
that
you
can
remand
with
the
--
with
direction--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--oh,
can
some
--
can
we
raise
that,
or
can
someone
else
raise
that?
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--well,
i
think
if
you
abide
my
idea
how
to
deal
with
this,
the
issue
of
alcoa's
vitality
would
remain
open
to
be
decided
in
another
case
another
day.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
that's
right,
because
a
vacation
can
rest
on
the
ground
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
reach
the
issue,
and
--
but
we're
--
we're
prepared
to
abide
judge
gould's
view
that,
in
a
regulated
industry,
we
can
only
have
a,
quote,
"price
squeeze"
if
the
price
is
predatory.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
no.
i
don't
think
they
decided
the
alcoa
question.
that's
the
way
i
read
the
decision,
because
i
know
what
he
certified.
i
know
what
they
said.
they
responded
only
to
a
very
narrow
question,
and
at&t
said
don't
venture
beyond
that.
don't--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--or
you
can
simply
say
that
the
case
is
remanded,
the
district
court
may
decide
the
propriety
of
an
amended
complaint,
except
that
the
amended
complaint
cannot
state
a
non-predatory
price-squeeze
claim.
we
are
prepared
to
live
with
that.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
thank
you.
