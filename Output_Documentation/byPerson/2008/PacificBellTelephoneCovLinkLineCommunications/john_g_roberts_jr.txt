chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
07-512,
pacific
bell
v.
link
line
communications.
mr.
panner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
probably
feeling
pretty
good
about
your
chances
since
your
opponent
has
given
up,
right?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
have
any
question,
or
should
we
have,
about
the
article
iii
status
of
this
aspect
of
the
dispute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
might
be
right,
but,
you
know,
with
respect
to
standing
we've
held
that
that
is
an
issue-by-issue
inquiry,
not
a
live
case
broadly
conceived.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any
way
in
which
the
resolution
of
their
price-squeeze
claim
would
affect
their
brooke
group
section
2
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
maynard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
blecher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
am
confused--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
am
confused
about
what
you
mean
when
you
say
"the
price
squeeze
claim".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
any
different
--
is
that
any
different
than
a
brooke
group
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
still
want
to
be
able
to
argue
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--above-cost
retail
prices--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--somehow
violate
brooke
group?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
--
you
agree
that
requires--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
requires
below-cost
retail
pricing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
the
wholesale
price
claim
that
the
ninth
circuit
looked
at
in
--
in
the
case
below,
in
the
decision
below,
a
necessary
or
significant
or
partial
element
of
your
brooke
group
claim,
or
is
it
totally
irrelevant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
it
would
have
been
nice,
if
you
thought
the
case
was
essentially
moot,
to
hear
about
that
in
the
cert
opposition.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
didn't
argue
that
the
decision
below
was
essentially
moot
in
your
opposition
to
certiorari
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer's
draft
judgment
said
we
would
vacate
the
decision
below.
shouldn't
we
reverse
it,
because
if
we
think
on
the
price-squeeze
claim,
as
distinct
from
the
brooke
group
claim,
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong?
we
don't
just
throw
it
out
and
let
everybody
go
home.
we
say
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong.
and
if
we're
saying
it's
wrong,
we
would
reverse.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
saying
we
don't
have
to
cross
the
rubicon
because
your
brooke
group
predatory
pricing
claim
will
show
that
the
prices
here
were
below
cost?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
don't
have
to
consider,
which
i
guess
i
thought
we
had
to
consider--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
you're
not
going
to
amend
your
complaint
to
raise
such
a
claim
on
remand?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
you
understand
to
require
that
the
retail
prices
be
below
cost?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
reason
you
think
we
should
vacate
is
not
because
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
decide
the
question,
but
because
you
are
willing
not
to
press
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
i
guess
--
i
guess
it's
where
we
are
about
to
go.
but
in
answer
to
justice
alito's
question,
if
we
think
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
and
don't
want
to
see
those
claims
raised
again,
we
need
to
address
the
merits
and
reverse?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
brunell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
means
they
don't
have
to
deal.
they
don't
have
to
sell
you
the
stuff
if
they
don't
want
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
mean
a
brooke
group
retail-price-squeeze
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your
sentence
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
panner,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-512,
pacific
bell
telephone
versus
linkline
communications.
this
is
a
case
about
dsl
service.
dsl
service
is
a
method
of
connecting
to
the
internet
at
high
speed
over
telephone
lines.
the
defendants
are
a
group
of
companies
that
have
gone
through
corporate
reorganizations
and
name
changes
while
the
case
was
pending
but
we'll
call
them
at&t.
the
federal
communications
commission
requires
at&t
to
sell
wholesale
dsl
services
to
independent
firms.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
such
independent
internet
service
providers
and
they
compete
against
at&t
in
the
retail
dsl
market
in
california.
these
companies
have
to
release
at
least
telephone
lines
from
at&t
as
otherwise
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
provide
the
service.
now,
those
plaintiffs
brought
suite
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
arguing
that
at&t
had
unlawfully
squeezed
their
profit
margins
by
charging
them
a
high
price
for
wholesale
dsl
service,
and
at
the
same
time,
setting
their
own
prize
too
low
for
the
retail
service.
the
plaintiffs
argued
that
this
maneuver
put
them
at
an
unfair
disadvantage
and
allowed
at&t
to
maintain
a
monopoly
over
the
dsl
market.
at&t
moved
to
dismiss
these
price
squeezed
claims,
but
the
district
court
denied
their
motion
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
hold
that
the
plaintiff
may
not
bring
a
prize
squeezed
claim
when
the
defendant
i
under
no
obligation
under
the
antitrust
laws
to
deal
with
the
plaintiff
in
the
first
place.
at&t's
obligation
to
deal
rose
only
because
of
the
fcc
regulation.
now,
a
price
squeeze
claim
involves
a
challenge
to
both
the
wholesale
price
and
a
retial
price.
that's
where
the
squeeze
comes
in.
our
recent
decision
in
the
case
called
trinko
holds
that
a
firm
with
no
deal,
no
duty
to
deal
under
the
antitrust
laws
like
at&t
here
does
not
need
to
deal
under
the
terms
and
conditions
its
rivals
would
prefer,
so
that
takes
care
of
the
allegation
about
the
wholesale
price.
now,
our
decision
in
the
case
called
brooke
group
takes
care
of
the
allegation
that
at&t's
retail
prices
were
too
low.
low
retail
prices
are
almost
always
a
good
thing,
so
this
court
has
allowed
anti-trust
claim
saying
that
prices
are
too
low
only
when
those
prices
are
below
cost
and
meet
other
strict
requirements.
the
plaintiffs
at
this
stage
of
the
case
do
not
make
any
allegations
of
below
price,
below
cost
pricing.
now,
when
there
is
no
duty
to
deal
a
the
wholesale
level
and
now
below
the
low
cost
pricing
at
the
retail
level,
a
firm
is
not
required
to
price
both
its
wholesale
and
retail
services
in
a
manner
that
preserves
its
rival's
profit
margins.
at&t's
to
rights
do
not
make
a
wrong.
we're
also
reluctant
to
recognize
these
claims
because
there's
no
easy
way
to
define
a
price
squeeze.
both
businesses
and
courts
need
clear
rules
to
operate
effectively,
but
every
price
squeeze
claim
would
require
a
complex
economic
analysis
of
pricing
practices
across
multiple
markets,
and
we
and
other
courts
are
just
not
that
good
at
that
sort
of
thing.
we're
likely
to
get
it
wrong
a
lot
and
everytime
we
do,
the
judiciary
would
be
imposing
higher
prices
on
consumers.
we're
very
reluctant
to
get
into
that
sort
of
business
in
the
first
place.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justices
stevens,
souter
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
