ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
a
retail-level
rival
can
state
a
section
claim
against
a
vertically
integrated
company
by
alleging
nothing
more
than
a
margin-based
price
squeeze,
one
of
two
outcomes
will
result:
either
the
vertically
integrated
company
will
have
to
raise
its
retail
prices
to
its
consumers,
or
it
will
be
forced
to
share
the
benefits
of
its
lawful
monopoly
with
its
rivals
by
lowering
its
wholesale
price.
either
outcome
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
antitrust
jurisprudence.
as
we
know
from
trinko,
in
the
absence
of
a
duty
to
deal,
a
monopolist
cannot
be
forced
to
share
the
benefits
of
its
lawful
monopoly
with
its
rivals
at
any
particular
turn.
and--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
do
think
the
alcoa
case
--
the
government
believes
the
alcoa
case
is
wrongly
decided,
justice
stevens.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
think
it's
--
i
mean,
one
could
say
that
judge
hand
didn't
necessarily
recognize
a
price-squeeze
claim
standing
alone
because
he
has
some
language
about
--
to
the
effect
that
perhaps
this
isn't
an
independent
wrong,
but
the
way
that
he
analyzed
it
separately
and
the
way
courts
have
ruled
--
have
relied
upon
it
to
suggest
that
a
mere
margin-based
price
squeeze
without
more
does
state
a
section
2
claim
is
incorrect.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
i
don't
think
technically
it
needs
overruling.
it's
a
--
it's
a
second
circuit
decision,
and
i
think
it
is
--
has
in
effect
been--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
think
the
court
should
say
it
was
decided
incorrectly.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes,
justice
stevens,
i
think
it's
incorrect.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes,
unless
you're
willing
to
say
judge
hand
didn't
hold
that
--
that
a
price-squeeze
claim
without
more
is
an
independent
theory
that
supports
a
section
2
claim.
as
long
as
you
think
that's
what
he
did
hold
--
and
many
people
do
think
that's
what
he
held
--
then,
yes,
you
do
need
to
say
it
was
wrongly
decided,
and
the
government
believes
it
is
wrongly
decided
and
that
it
has
already
been
overruled--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
regulation,
justice
breyer,
in
trinko
was
relevant
for
two
reasons
that
are
not
relevant
to
the
question
before
the
court
here.
first,
the
court
looked
to
the
regulation,
the
regulatory
duty,
and
made
a
decision
whether
the
regulatory
duty
itself
created
an
antitrust
duty
to
deal,
and
the
court
held
it
did
not.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that
holding
is
relevant
here
because
it
means
that
petitioners'
regulatory
to
deal
--
duty
to
deal
does
not
create
an
antitrust
duty
to
deal.
but
then
the
court
went
on
and
looked
at
the
court's
existing
antitrust
jurisprudence,
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
court's
antitrust
jurisprudence
recognized
a
duty
to
deal
in
that
circumstance,
and
concluded
it
did
not.
and
it
only
looked
to
the
regulation,
justice
breyer--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
a
couple
of
things.
i
mean,
this
case,
as
the
case
comes
to
the
court,
there
is
no
antitrust
duty
to
deal.
and
the
--
the
petitioners
here
the
district
court
determined
weren't
dealing
voluntarily,
justice
breyer;
they
were
dealing
as
a
result
of
regulatory
compulsion.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
the
--
the
important
point
from
trinko
that's
relevant
here
is
that
a
lawful
monopolist
without
an
antitrust
duty
to
deal
has
no
duty
to
deal
on
any
particular
terms;
and
trinko
specifically
says
that
a
lawful
monopolist
is
entitled
to
charge
the
monopoly
price.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that
takes--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that
takes
the
wholesale
price
and
the
possibility
of
lowering
that,
justice
breyer,
off
the
table;
and
without
the
top
pincer
as
it
were,
there
is
no
price
squeeze.
and
that
leaves
the
respondents
with
only
a
claim
that
the
petitioners'
prices
are
too
low.
and
whenever
a
party
claims
that
its
rival's
prices
are
too
low
for
it
to
be
able
to
compete,
that
triggers
all
of
the
concerns
that
this
court
expressed
in
brooke
group.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
the
government's
view
is
that
the
current
antitrust
doctrine
already
forecloses
this
claim
for
the
reasons
that
i
was
explaining.
now,
if
the
court
were
going
to
consider
this
as
whether
were
you
going
to
reach
out
and
extend
the
antitrust
law--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
the
--
the
respondents
here
were
attempting
to
press,
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
allowed
them
to
go
forward
on,
a
treble
damages
claim
where
they
seek
$40
million
under
a
pure
margin-based
price-squeeze
theory.
and
in
the
government's
view,
that
--
such
a
rule
would
protect
only
competitors
and
doesn't
allege
any
harm
to
the
competitive
process,
which
section
2
requires.
whether
or
not
the
fcc
has
regulatory
authority
or
not
over
the
basic
question
--
over
its
own
issues
--
isn't
relevant
to
the
antitrust
question
before
the
court
here,
which
is,
does
the
court's
current
antitrust
jurisprudence
foreclose
such
a
pure
margin-based
price
squeeze?
and
the
government
is
not
saying
that
there
might
not
be
some
exclusionary
conduct,
justice
breyer,
that
could
someday
be
alleged,
if
there
--
there
was
an
attempt,
say,
to
claim
--
of
an
attempt
at
the
upstream
market,
as
you
were
positing.
that's
not
the
claim
here,
nor
in
most
price-squeeze
claims
of
which
i'm
aware;
the
claim
is
that
they
are
attempting
to
monopolize
the
downstream
market.
so
the
government
does
mean
to
foreclose
--
at
this
court
has
recognized,
there
are
myriad
ways
in
which
companies
can
engage
in
exclusionary
conduct.
the
government's
position
is
a
narrow
one,
which
is
that
a
pure
margin-based
price
squeeze,
in
the
absence
of
a
duty
to
deal
--
that
is,
this
person
who
is
dealing
with
me
is
--
is
charging
me
too
much
so
that
i
can't
compete
against
it
at
retail
--
that
is
nothing
more
than
proof
that
they
can't
compete.
that
doesn't
show
any
harm
to
the
competitive
process,
which
is
what
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
is
required
for
liability
under
section
2,
and
for
good
reason.
and,
justice
souter,
in
response
to
your
earlier
question,
the
government
is
not
saying
that
it's
not
plausible
that
there
isn't
some
anticompetitive
conduct
that
will
go
unchecked
as
a
result
of
such
a
rule,
but
the
court's
analysis
in
brooke
group
is
the
proper
one,
which
is
that
ultimately
what
you
will
be
doing
is
telling
a
retail-level
competitor
that
it
must
raise
its
prices
in
order
to
prevent
liability.
that
really
isn't,
as
mr.
panner
said,
worth
the
candle,
and
it
creates
the
risk
of
chilling
legitimate
price
cutting,
and
it
puts
the
courts
in
the
--
in
the
role,
essentially,
of
being
a
regulator,
maybe
not
just
at
one
level,
but
at
two.
and--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that
if
there
is
something
anticompetitive
going
on,
that
section
2
cares
about--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--they
would
need
to
allege
that
the
petitioners'
retail
prices
are
below
some
appropriate
measure
of
the
--
of
the
petitioners'
costs;
and
what
they
want
to
do
is
attribute
--
and
what
alcoa
does,
which
is
why
it's
mistaken,
is
it
attributes
--
it
would
attribute
to
petitioners
the
wholesale
price
they
are
willing
to
sell
their
upstream
input
to
others,
and
what
brooke
group
makes
clear
is
that
the
relevant
cost
is
the
internal
cost
to
the
petitioners.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
we
believe
that
if
they
can
allege
the
elements
of
a
predatory
pricing
claim
under
brooke
group,
then
they
would
still
have
that
claim
even
in
the
absence
of
a
duty
to
deal,
and
that
labeling
it
a
predatory
price
squeeze
doesn't
add
anything,
that
the
court
should
clarify
that
there
is
no
separate
price-squeeze
theory
of
section
2
liability,
if
that's
all
that
is
without
more.
but
there
would
remain
a
predatory
pricing
theory
under
brooke
group
if
those
allegations
could
be
met.
does
that
answer
your
question?
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
thank
you.
