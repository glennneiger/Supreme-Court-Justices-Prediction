justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
could
just
ask
--
everything
you've
said
is
applicable
to
a
predatory
price
claim
as
well
as
a
price
squeeze?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
don't
certify
questions;
you
certify
orders.
and
in
the
certification
of
this
order,
i
take
it,
your
position
was
in
support
of
what
the
district
court
did
and
in
support
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
made
--
you
made
--
you
made
an
argument,
or
did
you
not,
that's
consistent
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
hold
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
wasn't
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
consistent
with
the
argument
that
you
made
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
first--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
the
first
time
that
you
indicated
that
you
were
in
agreement
with
the
gould
dissent
in
your
--
the
brief
that
you
filed
here
in
this
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
seems
to
me
that,
in
that
instance,
you
seriously
prejudiced
the
--
the
petitioners
here,
and
that
that
should
be
weighed
heavily
against
you
when
you
ask
to
--
for
permission
to
amend
your
complaint
in
the
district
court.
i
mean--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there
have
--
there
have
been
costs
and
time--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--nor
did
you
give
notice
to
the
petitioners'
attorney
that
that
was
your
position
so
that
you
could
have
asked
for
a
stipulation
on
the
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
it
--
is
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--has
the
brooke
group
complaint
been
allowed
in
the
district
court
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
has
been
tried?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
you
say
that
absent
the
regulatory
regime,
there
would
be
a
duty
to
deal
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
my
question
is:
was
there
a
duty
to
deal
under
the
antitrust
laws?
because
it
seems
to
me
the
only
reason
that
there's
a
duty
to
deal
is
because
of
the
regulation.
so,
you
--
you
use
the
regulation
in
order
to
establish
the
duty,
but
then
you
don't
want
to
go
to
the
regulators
to
regulate
the
price.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
inconsistent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
still
seems
to
me
that
--
that
you,
therefore,
must
rely
on
the
regulation
to
establish
the
initial
predicate
of
a
duty
to
deal.
and
you
rely
on
the
regulation
that
far,
but
you
don't
want
to
go
to
the
regulators
to
--
to
argue
about
the
price.
you
want
us
to
look
at
regulation
first
and
antitrust
law
second.
why
can't
we
just
look
at
this
case
as
purely
antitrust?
and
then,
as
justice
breyer
said,
if
it's
a
regulatory
problem,
go
to
the
regulators.
