justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing?
are
you
arguing
there's
never
a
price-squeeze
claim
under
section
2?
in
other
words,
are
you
challenging
justice
hand's
reasoning
in
the
alcoa
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
such
a
duty
in
the
alcoa
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
maynard,
do
you
join
in
your
colleague's
suggestion
that
we
should
overrule
the
alcoa
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it's
necessary
to
do
so
to
decide
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is
whether
you
think
it's
--
it's
necessary
to
overrule
that
decision
in
order
to
decide
this
case
correctly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
have
to
say
it
was
decided
incorrectly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
my
question.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
think
it's
incorrect.
i
am
asking
whether
you
think
we
have
to
say
it's
incorrect
in
order
to
decide
this
case
correctly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
--
may
i
ask?
i'm
not
familiar
on
this
point.
apart
from
alcoa,
what
are
the
cases
applying
a
traditional
price-squeeze
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent's
submission
that
antitrust
scholars
uniformly
agree
that
the
alcoa
case
was
incorrectly
decided?
