you
don't
think
that
under
our
federal
system,
the
states
have
greater
powers
deciding
how
they
are
going
to
organize
themselves
than
they
have
with
respect
to
the
regulation
of
artificial
private
entities
that
they
choose
to
permit
under
state
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
say
there
is
a
sufficient
--
presumably
you
concede
there
is
a
sufficient
justification
for
this
content-based
restriction
as
to
state
employees.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
there
is
state
money
involved
in
these
payroll
systems
that
would
be
sufficient?
