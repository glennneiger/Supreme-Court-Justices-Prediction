are
there
--
are
there
in
counties
some
charitable
drives
that
occur
annually
and
that
permit
employees
to
donate
to
those
charities
through
deductions
from
their
wages?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
would
they
presumably
be
covered
by
this?
united
fund
drives,
so-called,
my
--
my
recollection
is
that
usually
the
contributions
to
that
simply
come
out
of
--
are
deducted
from
the
wages.
and
if
they
existed
in
the
counties,
presumably
they
would
have
been
covered.
but
we
don't
know
if
they
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it's
only
political
activities?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
well,
none
of
those
would
allow
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
--
would
they
include
contributions
to
an
organization
that
makes
contributions
to
political
parties--
justice
antonin
scalia
--such
as
a
right-to
work-organization?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
state
give
some
particular
favor
to
unions?
i
mean,
does
it
allow
--
what
--
what
is
the
situation?
can
you
be
forced
to
contribute
to
the
union
even
though
you're
not
a
union
member?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
unions
do
have
a
special
prerogative
which
--
which
no
other
organizations,
as
far
as
you're
aware,
have
in
the
state,
which
is
to
have
money
deducted
from
people's
payrolls?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
the
point
of
my
question
is
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
terribly
discriminatory
if
indeed
the
only
organizations
in
the
state
that
are
given
the
right,
whether
by
federal
or
state
law,
to
deduct,
private
organizations,
given
the
right
to
deduct
from
the
salary
a
municipal
or
private
employer
pays.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
particularly
discriminatory
to
say
that,
moreover,
in
making
those
deductions,
no
part
of
it
will
be
given
for
political
activities.
i
mean
you're
only
addressing
a
narrow
class,
but
it's
a
narrow
class
that
has
a
special
benefit.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
hatch
act?
does
--
does
--
does
the
state
allow
state
employees
to
engage
in
political
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
interesting.
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
collins,
suppose
--
i
gather
idaho
doesn't
have
it,
but
suppose
idaho
wanted
a
hatch
act
similar
to
the
federal
hatch
act
that
prohibits
federal
employees
from
engaging
in
political
activity,
and
suppose
it
decided
that
not
only
should
the
state
employees
at
the
capital
not
engage
in
political
activities,
but
it's
a
problem
for
any
governmental
employee
to
do
that;
they
ought
to
be
neutral
and
we
don't
want
patronage
to
be
passed
out
on
the
basis
of
whether
they
are
campaigning
for
one
party
or
another,
and
we
don't
want
them
to
be
coerced
into
campaigning
for
one
party
or
another.
now,
i
assume
that
such
a
law
would
violate
the
first
amendment
if
it
were
extended
to
all
employers.
saying
no
--
no
company
employee,
no
private
employee
can
engage
in
political
activity
would
surely
violate
the
first
amendment.
would
it
violate
the
first
amendment
if
it
was
extended?
certainly,
it
doesn't
when
it's
applied
to
state
employees
because
there
are
a
lot
of
state
hatch
acts.
and
you're
saying
it
would
violate
the
first
amendment
as
applied
to
county
and
municipal
employees?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
--
you're
analogizing
these
to
private
entities.
that's
your
whole
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
a
creature
of
the
state.
you're
saying
what
the
first
amendment
--
as
the
first
amendment
applies
to
private
individuals,
so
it
applies
here.
this
is
regulation
by
the
state,
rather
than
the
state's
control
of
state
government.
