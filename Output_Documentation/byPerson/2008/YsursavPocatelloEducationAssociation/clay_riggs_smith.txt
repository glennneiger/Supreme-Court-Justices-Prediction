mr.
clay
riggs
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
narrowed
to
a
single,
but
from
the
petitioner's
perspective
a
critical,
dispute
over
the
scope
of
internal
state
sovereignty:
whether
the
first
amendment
trumps
the
otherwise
existing
authority
of
the
idaho
legislature
to
direct
political
subdivisions
of
the
state
to
take
an
action,
here
restricting
access
to
their
payroll
systems,
that
the
subdivisions
could
take
independently
without
violating
the
amendment.
the
genesis
of
this
dispute
is
idaho
code
section
44-2004(2),
which
was
adopted
in
2003.
that
provision
prohibits
state
and
local
government
public
employers
from
deducting
amounts
for
political
activities
from
the
payroll
checks
due
to
their
employees
and
remitting
those
amounts
to
third
parties.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
as
construed
by
the
district
court,
it
did.
the
base
legislation
in
this,
the
voluntary
contribution
act,
excluded
from
application
an
employee
--
an
employer
subject
to
the
two
major
labor
--
federal
labor
relations
statutes,
the
nlra
and
the
rla.
but
there
was
obviously
a
group
of
employers,
private
employers,
in
--
who
were
not
engaged
in
commerce,
as
well
as
the
agricultural
sector.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
--
yes,
your
honor,
we
did.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
we
do.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
well,
the
principal
difference
is
that
one
is
a
private
employer
--
that
is
to
say,
engaging
in
private
speech
--
while
the
public
employer
is
a
--
is
a
subdivision
of
the
state
of
idaho,
subject,
we
would
argue,
to
the
plenary
control,
pursuant
to
the
idaho
constitution,
of
the
idaho
legislature.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
in
a
word,
the
answer
is
no.
i
don't
believe
we,
referring
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
could
have
written
the
--
the
political
subdivisions
of
a
state
to
direct
them
to
take
an
action
unless
there
was
a
legislative
basis
for
doing
so.
in
this
instance,
the
--
the
legislature
concluded
that
it
wanted
all
public
employers,
among
others,
to
not
allow
access
to
their
payroll
systems.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
statute
in
2003,
yes.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
well,
there
is
a
fundamental
difference,
your
honor.
and
--
and
it
rests
in
the
notion
that
the
state
has
no
interest
in
the
--
in
private
employers'
determination
to
be
involved
or
not
involved
in
political
matters.
the
state
legislature,
however,
has
a
very
concrete
interest
in
avoiding
either
the
reality
or
the
appearance--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--it
might,
your
honor,
but
that
situation,
of
course,
is
not
the
situation
presented
here.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
because
the
statute
at
issue
here,
justice
kennedy,
speaks
across
the
board
to
a
specific
kind
of
conduct,
political
activities.
it
does
so
in
the
a
viewpoint-neutral
fashion.
to
prohibit
a
particular
parade
might
well
raise
viewpoint
non-neutrality
issues.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
they
are
incorrect
about
that.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
statute
is
viewpoint-neutral.
indeed--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--the
answer
is
no.
it
--
the
--
the
statute
just
--
does
not
just
affect
union
speech
by
its
literal
terms.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
well,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record,
your
honor,
as
to
any
other
entity
who
is
affected
by
the
statute.
but
that
is
hardly
--
that's
hardly
remarkable,
given
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
in
the
litigation
are
six
labor
organizations.
i
should
add
that--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
--
the
contribution
was
for
political
activities--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--that's
correct.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
again,
it
depends.
i
--
i
don't
know
the
answer.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
in
fact,
we
argued
below
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
of
access
to
the
payroll
system
for
purposes
of
making
political
contributions.
and
let
me
reiterate
at
this--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--well,
the
--
i
would
suggest
that
a
remand
for
that
purpose
would
be
futile.
the
district
court,
as
i
said
before,
concluded
that
the
statute
is
viewpoint
neutral.
and
let
me
stress
that
the
term
"political
activities"
does
not
--
is
not
defined
with
reference
to
unions
or
speech
by
other
entities
that
might
be
controlled
by
unions.
it
addresses
political
contributions
for
electoral
matters,
independent
expenditures,
and
expenditures
to
political
parties.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
yes,
to
the--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--to
the
extent
that
the
--
the
organization
is,
for
example,
a
political
action
committee,
it
would.
and
let
me
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
for
a
moment.
had
the
legislature
intended
44-2004(2)
to
apply
only
to
unions,
they
would
have
--
it
would
have
been
engaging
in
a
redundancy
because
under
another
provision
of
the
same
legislation,
44-2603(1)(b)(iv),
which
appears
at
petition
appendix
70,
the
idaho
legislature
proscribed
amounts
being
--
amounts
--
required
all
amounts
to
be
paid
--
paid
to
a
separate
segregated
fund
which
was
established
pursuant
to
the
legislation
that
was
invalidated
by
the
district
court,
required
those
kinds
of
contributions
to
be
made
directly
by
the
employee
and
not
through
--
or
not
by
the
employee's
employer.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
no,
your
honor.
the
--
44-2004(2)
is
part
of
the
idaho
right
to
work
act,
which
was
adopted
in
the
mid
1980s.
it
allows
amounts
to
be
deducted
through
payroll
checkoffs
for
union
dues.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that's
--
that's
correct.
the--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--true.
but
let
--
let
me
--
let
me
continue
with
my
response
to
justice
scalia's
question.
the
special
prerogative
that,
for
example,
the
pocatello
education
association
or
the
firefighters
union
has
is
the
ability
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
pursuant
to
state
statute
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of,
for
example,
the
pocatello
school
district's
teachers.
that
exclusivity
which
is
granted
to
a
limited
number
of
--
of
--
in
fact,
two
areas
under
colorado
--
excuse
me
--
under
idaho
law,
namely,
firefighters
and
teachers,
is
the
extraordinary
benefit
that
unions
have.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
well,
i
would
agree
that
--
that
unions
have,
and
particularly
these
--
particularly
the
respondents
have
a
special
benefit.
but
again,
i
go
back
to
the
basic
point
that
2004(2)
addresses
all
public
employers
or
public
employees
and
is
not
limited
to
political
activity
contributions.
that
might
be,
for
example,
as
the
situation
is
here,
to
a
union-sponsored
political
action
--
political
action
committee.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
local
governments
have
discretion.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
with
respect--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--well,
it
takes
away
that
discretion
with
respect
to
any
third
party
who
might
receive
amounts
for
political
activities.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
the
reason,
as
we
articulate
in
our
brief,
is
the
desire
to
avoid
either
the
appearance
or
the
reality
of
public
employer
involvement
in,
in
this
instance,
electoral
politics.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
outside
the
area
of
elections,
not
with
respect
to
payroll
deductions.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
the
--
the
county
--
counties
in
idaho
and
i
suppose
in
most
states
act
as
political
subdivisions
of
the
state.
and
whatever
authority
they
have
or
don't
have
derives,
if
not
exclusively,
virtually
exclusively
from
state
law.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
let
me
go
back
to
the
election
context
for
a
moment
to
try
to
address
that
question.
prior
to
its
amendments
pursuant
to
the
legislation
at
hand,
idaho
code
section
67-6605,
which
is
part
of
idaho's
election
campaign
finance
and
reporting
statute
or
general
statutes,
allowed
payroll
deductions
to
be
made
for
contributions
to
political
committees.
in
that
sense,
it
allowed
counties,
as
well
as
other
public
employers,
to
make
deductions
of
the
kind
at
issue
today.
now,
that
authority
was
rescinded
by
virtue
of
the
amendment
to
2004(2).
the
point
simply
is
that
if
necessary,
we
--
we
could
describe
in
detail
various
kinds
of
--
of
requirements
that
exist
with
respect
to
counties
or
school
districts
or
cities.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
well,
your
honor,
for
example,
with
respect
to
--
take
open
meetings,
for
example,
take
public
records,
for
example.
those
are
general
kinds
of
statutes
that
impose
requirements
on
all
levels
of
state
government.
so,
for
example,
with
respect
to
open
meetings,
the
idaho
law
requires
essentially
all
meetings,
except
for
certain
exclusions,
to
be
open
to
the
public.
in
that
sense,
it's
akin
to
the
wisconsin
statute.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
it
does,
but
not
--
not
in
connection
with
their
public
employment
activities.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
it
means
that
there
is
no
prohibition
under
state
law,
for
example,
for
a
public
employee
to
engage
in
political
activity.
if
--
but
our
statute
in
idaho
applies
actually
only
to
state
employees.
it
doesn't
govern
those
kinds
of
activities
by
local
government.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
it
would
be
an
acceptable
proposition
to
the
extent
that
federal
law
doesn't
pre-empt
state
law,
your
honor.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
in
this
instance,
we
would
argue
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
interpose
some
kind
of
barrier
to
essentially
vulcanize
local
government
from
state
legislative
control.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
depending
on
--
on
the
facts,
i
--
i
would
agree
that
it
is
certainly
possible
for
the
state
law
to--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--well,
but
--
but,
your
honor,
that
is,
i
think,
beyond
cavil;
that
is
to
say
that
federal
law--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--beyond
cavil,
beyond--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--well,
it
--
it
depends
on--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--your
honor,
perhaps
it
was
--
it
was
an
argument
that
we
don't
have
to
make
in
this
instance.
needless
to
say,
by
virtue
of
the
supremacy
clause,
there
may
be
instances
where
federal
law--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--it
is
beyond
cavil
if
the
federal
law,
in
fact,
supersedes
state
law.
there
may
be
issues--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--that's
correct.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
i
disagree,
justice
souter.
the
--
as
i
stated
in
response
to
justice
stevens,
the
difference
is
a
central
one.
that
is
to
say,
a
corporation
is
a
private
entity
with
--
with
distinct
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
i
disagree
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
attempt
to
equate
a
private
corporation
with
essentially
an
agent
or
an
arm
of
the
state
such
as
a
county,
which
has
been
delegated
governmental
functions.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
well,
that
is
--
certainly
is
the
distinction
between
a
private
corporation
and,
for
example,
a
county.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
and
--
and
the
very
nature
of
the
entity,
itself,
your
honor.
a
county--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--a
county
or
school
district
performs
functions
assigned
to
it
by
the
state
legislature
to
carry
out
the
function,
to
carry
out
activities
that
are
public
in
nature.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
i
--
i
can
only
repeat
that
the
distinction
between
the
private
corporation
and
the
--
and
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
is
that,
in
fact,
one
is
an
entity
created
by
the
legislature
for
the
very
purpose
of
carrying
out
state
governmental
functions.
that
--
that,
i
think,
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
position
argued
throughout
this
case.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
and
your
honor,
i
think
i
responded.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
yes.
states
--
of
course
states
do
have
that
authority.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
thank
you.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
there
is
state
funding,
but
the
reason,
i
believe,
why
the
respondents
--
excuse
me
the
petitioners
--
have
conceded
that
the
subsidization
case
law
does
not
apply
to
this
statute
in
its
application
to
the
local
governments,
is
that
what
the
subsidization
cases
are
talking
about
--
cases
like
regan,
rust,
findley
--
are
situations
where
we'll
say
the
state
is
involved
in
developing
a
program
which
it
will
pay
for,
and
it
says
because
we
are
paying
for
that,
our
priorities
are
to
be
honored.
the
government
in
this
instance,
it's
been
conceded,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
there
is
no
actual
subsidization
to
the
payroll
systems.
in
effect
the
state
says
we
have
some
money
we
give
to
our
local
governments
--
by
no
means,
all
revenue,
but
they
get
some
money.
but
we
--
the
state
does
not
set
the
kinds
of
budget
priorities
that
are
protected
by
the
regan
line
of
cases.
specifically,
the
state
in
effect
says
that
as
far
as
payroll
systems
and
in
fact
as
far
as
most
employment
matters
and
most
administrative
matters
are
concerned,
here's
some
money
for
you,
local
government.
the
only
thing
we
say
about
it
is
don't
use
it
for
political
payroll
deductions.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
but
the
difference,
your
honor,
in
all
of
the
other
cases
one
could
look
at
regan
and
the
like,
there
is
a
program
where
the
government
is
involved
in
its
manifold
details.
the
government
determines
the
purpose
of
the
program;
it
has
an
overriding
interest
in
the
program;
and
it
says
in
the
course
of
that,
in
the
course
of
dealing
with
this
program,
we
don't
want
government
money
to
be
used
for
the
following
things.
if
you
--
if
that
were
extended
to
say
that
there
will
be
essentially
no
first
amendment
claim
whenever
the
government
says
as
to
some
program
that
it
has
no
other
involvement
and
that
it
has
no
other
interest
in,
we
don't
want
the
following
speech,
and
over
here
we
don't
have
the
following
speech--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
two
points
that
i
think
are
critical.
first,
the
concession
with
respect
to
the
state
government
employees
based
on
regan
it
itself
entails
a
concession
as
to
the
reasonableness
and
the
due
point
neutrality
of
the
statute.
two,
respondents'
theory
of
government
with
respect
to
the
legislature
having
to
speak
in
some
kind
of
specific
term,
we
would
suggest,
ignores
--
would
ask
this
court
to
create
entirely
new
case
law.
but
it
also
ignores
in
this
situation
the
fact
that
the
idaho
legislature
contributes
in
2006-2007
about
half
of
the
funds
used
by
school
districts
in
the
state.
and
over
80
percent
of
those
funds
that
go
into
what
is
known
as
a
general
maintenance
and
operations
fund
from
which
salary
compensation
is
paid.
thank
you.
