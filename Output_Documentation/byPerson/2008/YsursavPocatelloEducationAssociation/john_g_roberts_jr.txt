chief

jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-869,
ysursa
v.
pocatello
education
association.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
justice
stevens's
question
highlights
for
me
one
of
the
confusing
parts
of
this
case.
you
sort
of
paired
off
a
number
of
the
people
who
would
otherwise
be
covered,
and
you
are
left
with
the
county
employees.
if
you
had
started
with
the
county
employees,
is
this
how
you
would
have
gone
about
telling
them
they
can't
do
this?
i
mean
the
county
employers.
would
you
have
passed
a
law
saying
that
the
county
employers
are
not
allowed
to
have
this
checkoff?
if
you
think
they
are
part
of
the
state,
i
guess
you
could
have
just
written
them
a
letter
and
say
don't
do
this,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
because
the
state
couldn't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no
other
organization
other
than
the
federal,
state
and
local
governments.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
there
other
areas
in
which
the
state
exercises
the
authority
you're
asserting
here
with
respect
to
county
employers,
telling
them
what
they
can
and
can't
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean
more
generally.
your
assertion
is
that
this
is
part
of
the
state,
and
therefore,
as
i
gather,
it's
conceded
on
the
other
side,
this
is
acceptable
with
respect
to
state
employees
but
not
other
public
employers.
are
there
other
areas
in
which
you
act
like
the
counties
are
part
of
the
state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
looking
for--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
looking
for
a
specific
example.
i
mean,
maybe
counties
or
municipalities,
you
know,
contract
for
trash
collection
or
water
services
and
maybe
the
state
tells
them,
look,
you've
got
to
deal
with
these
people,
you've
got
to
do
it
by
open
bidding,
whatever.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
--
since
i
asked
the
question,
i
think
it's
necessary.
so
what's
the
best
example
where
the
state
exercises
control
over
what
the
counties
would
otherwise
have
discretion
to
do?
you
mentioned
school
districts.
is
that
--
is
that
an
area?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
--
i
didn't
hear
you.
you
think
that's
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
depends
--
i
mean
the
whole
case
turns
on
--
and
the
response
to
justice
kennedy,
i
think,
would
be
--
if
the
federal
government
is
simply
saying
you
can
do
it
if
you
want,
that's
one
thing.
if
the
federal
government
is
saying
you
must
do
it
because
it's
covered
by
the
federal
power
act,
or
whatever,
that's
different.
if
it's
just
a
grant
of
permission,
i
would
suppose
the
state
can
say,
well,
fine,
it's
okay
with
the
feds,
but
you
can't
do
it
because
we
don't
want
you
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
we'll
give
you
a
minute
for
rebuttal--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--since
our
questioning
has
taken
away
from
your
time.
mr.
collins.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
you
have
any
doubt
how
they
would?
i
mean,
they
passed
a
law
dictating
that
with
respect
to
everybody.
and
then
it's
pared
down
by
litigation
and
concessions.
so,
we
don't
have
any
real
question
of
what
the
state
is
wanting
to
do
here.
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--since
we
are
in
confessional
mode,
i've
never
understood
forum
analysis.
i
don't
understand
how
----
[laughter]
--how
you
can
say
that
this
payroll
deduction
system
is
some
kind
of
a
forum.
a
forum
is,
you
know,
the
corner
at
hyde
park
or
something.
this
is
--
this
is
something
that
governmental
entities
and
private
entities
do,
and
they
can
either
exclude
this
type
of
activity
or
they
can't.
and
the
problem
with
the
forum
analysis
is
it's
all
or
nothing.
i
mean
--
and
both
parties
seem
to
agree:
if
it's
a
state
forum,
you
could
do
it;
if
it's
a
private
forum
or
if
it's
an
open
forum,
you
can't.
that's
not
how
we
usually
analyze
these
things.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
are
you
--
why
are
you
focusing
on
heightened
scrutiny?
we
have
a
whole
series
of
cases
about
employee
speech
darcetti
and
pickering
where
it's
quite
different
than
heightened
scrutiny,
and
here
we
are
talking
about
the
employees
being
able
to
deduct
checkoffs
from
their
paycheck
for
political
speech?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
smith,
you
have
one
minute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-869,
ysursa
versus
pocatello
education
association.
under
idaho
law,
a
public
employee
may
elect
to
have
a
portion
of
his
wages
deducted
and
remitted
to
his
union
to
pay
union
dues.
but
idaho
law
prohibits
payroll
deductions
for
political
activities.
so
a
public
employee
may
not
have
a
dues
checkoff
for
the
union's
political
action
committee.
a
group
of
idaho
public
employee
unions
sued,
alleging
that
idaho's
ban
on
payroll
deductions
for
political
activities
violated
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
first
amendment
prohibits
government
from
"abridging
the
freedom
of
speech".
restrictions
that
single
out
a
category
of
speech
for
disfavored
treatment
are
presumptively
invalid.
first
amendment
does
not,
however,
impose
an
obligation
on
government
to
subsidize
speech.
a
state
is
therefore
not
required
to
assist
others
in
funding
the
expression
of
particular
ideas.
idaho's
law
does
not
restrict
political
speech
but
rather
declines
to
promote
that
speech
by
allowing
public
employee
checkoffs
for
political
activities.
idaho's
public
employee
unions
are
free
to
engage
in
such
speech
as
they
see
fit.
they
simply
are
barred
from
enlisting
the
state
in
support
of
that
endeavor.
idaho's
decision
to
limit
public
employee
payroll
deductions
as
it
has
does
not
infringe
the
unions'
first
amendment
rights.
the
state
accordingly
need
only
demonstrate
a
rational
basis
to
justify
the
ban.
idaho's
justification
is
the
interest
in
avoiding
the
reality
or
appearance
of
government
favoritism
or
entanglement
with
partisan
politics.
and
the
state's
response
targets
its
source,
political
payroll
deductions.
the
ban
plainly
serves
the
state's
interest
in
separating
public
employment
from
political
activities.
now,
the
union
say
that
whether
or
not
all
that
is
true,
that
only
justifies
the
ban
at
the
level
of
state
employers
not
local
government
employers.
but
the
same
analysis
applies
whether
the
ban
is
directed
at
state
or
local
government
entities.
political
subdivisions
have
never
been
considered
sovereign
entities
but
are
instead
subordinate
governmental
instrumentalities
carrying
out
state
governmental
functions.
idaho's
interest
in
separating
the
operation
of
government
from
parties
and
politics
extends
to
all
public
employers
at
whatever
level
of
government.
now,
given
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
its
political
subdivisions,
it
is
immaterial
how
the
state
allocates
funding
or
management
responsibilities
between
the
different
levels
of
government.
the
first
amendment
analysis
does
not
vary
depending
on
the
level
of
government
affected.
the
state
is
not
required
to
promote
political
speech
by
allowing
public
employee
checkoffs
for
political
activities.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
and
justices
stevens
and
souter
have
filed
dissenting
opinions.
