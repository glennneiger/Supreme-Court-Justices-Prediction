didn't
the
statute
also
prohibit
private
employers
from
doing
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
concede
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
agree
with
that
conclusion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
the
difference
between
the
private
employer
and
the
county
agency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
understand
that
the
counties,
if
they
elected
to,
could
decide
not
to
--
not
to
do
the
checkoff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
why
should
counties
be
different
from
--
from
--
i'm
still
puzzled
about
why
counties
--
county
employers
are
different
from
private
employers
in
terms
of
the
state
interest
in
preventing
the
checkoff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about,
say,
an
attempt
to
deduct
contributions
to
a
charity
like
the
united
fund?
do
counties
have
a
choice
to
either
do
that
or
not
do
it,
or
does
state
law
require
them
to
accept
such
requests?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
have
discretion
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
respect
to
the
union
situation,
the
statute
takes
away
that
discretion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
question
is
why
is
there
--
why
is
there
a
state
interest
in
taking
away
that
discretion
for
unions,
but
not
as
to
charities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
political
activities.
but
what
is
--
what
is
the
reason
for
differentiating
political
activities
from
charities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
collins,
may
i
interrupt
you
and
ask
you
the
converse
of
the
question
i
asked
your
opponent?
he
conceded
that
it
was
unconstitutionally
what
you
call
it,
content
discrimination
--
whatever
--
to
have
the
deduction
from
the
private
sector,
but
the
counties
were
different;
and
he
justified
the
counties
on
the
ground
that
the
state's
interest
in
avoiding
taking
a
position
with
regard
to
union
matters
justifies
it.
but
that's
the
only
justification
for
the
--
it's
not
the
administrative
justification
--
this
statute
wasn't
enacted
to
save
the
government
administrative
expenses.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
perfectly
clear,
and
i'm
surprised
that
you
concede
that
it's
constitutional
as
applied
to
the
state
government,
when
there's
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
it
serves
the
purpose
that
everybody
is
talking
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
is
not
a
case
involving
a
state's
decision
not
to
spend
the
time
and
energy
to
do
payroll
deductions
because
they
do
them
for
everybody
else.
it's
simply
based
on
the
reason
for
the
payroll
deduction,
which
is,
in
your
view,
an
impermissible
reason.
is
that
not
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
it
not
be
clear?
it
enacted
a
general
statute
that
had
the
same
justification
throughout
the
state.
and
now
you're
justifying
on
the
ground
it
doesn't
apply
to
all
their
other
government
activities
because
they
allow
payroll
deductions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see
your
argument.
