mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
turns
on
three
points.
first,
the
statute
at
issue
is
a
content-based
restriction
on
speech
which
is
therefore
presumptively
invalid,
requires
heightened
scrutiny,
which
petitioners
acknowledge
they
have
not
satisfied,
unless
one
of
the
exceptions
to
heightened
scrutiny
is
applicable
here,
those
being
exceptions
which
as
the
court
has
explained
in
r.a.v.
and
davenport,
are
limited
to
circumstances
where
there
is
no
real
risk
of
viewpoint
suppression.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
we
don't
take
that
position
at
all,
because,
as
the
court
has
indicated
in
letter
carriers
and
broadrick
and
other
cases,
there
is
a
compelling
interest
in
a
statute
which
says
that
government
employees
--
and
it
could
be
state
or
local
--
will
not
be
performing
their
jobs
as
servants
of
politics.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
that's
not
our
point.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
we
are
saying
that,
your
honor,
because
the
only
defense
that
the
state
can
possibly
offer
here
to
this
content
discrimination
is
the
forum
notion
that
the
state
has
introduced.
in
the
case
of--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--it's
not
a
forum
analysis.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
yes.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that,
under
regan
and
finley
and
rust
and
the
other
cases,
the
state
has
perfect
freedom
to
decide
not
to
devote
its
own
resources
and
expenditure.
but
interestingly
and
very
much
on
point
here--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--yes,
your
honor,
and
let
me
explain
because
those
are
two
--
the
answer
to
both
questions
is
"yes"
but
for
two
very
different
reasons.
the
answer
to
the
second
question
is
that
our
contention
is
not
that
the
state
is
never
a
proprietor
and
never
entitled
to
the
kind
of
deference
that
goes
with
the
proprietor
when
it's
dealing
with
local
government
programs.
as
the
court
noted
in
the
council
of
greenberg
case,
a
government
can
become
a
proprietor
with
respect
to
property
or
programs
it
doesn't
actually
own.
our
point
is
quite
simply
that
the
state
has
not
done
that
here.
that's
why,
if
the
state
had
done
it,
if
the
state
said
we
are
going
to
dictate
the
nature
of
payroll
deduction
systems
for
and
local
governments,
the
state
could
do
that,
and
it
would
be
then--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--what
i'm
suggesting,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
since
we
are
beginning
with
a
content-based
restriction
--
and
i
do
want
to
emphasize
it's
a
law
here
which
says
that
for
all
employers
--
public,
private,
or
state
--
the
only
expenditure
you
can't
make
through
payroll
deduction
is
for
political
activities,
and
also
the
only
resource
of
an
employer
that
can't
be
used
for
any
kind
of
political
activity
is
payroll
deduction,
this
being
in
a
statute
targeted
at
employee
support
of
union
activity.
so,
we
have
a
content-based
restriction,
and
the
question
is:
can
it
come
within
an
exception
to
the
heightened
scrutiny
that
petitioners
acknowledge
they
can't
satisfy?
but
when
i'm
suggesting
that
the
state
could
come
within
reduced
scrutiny
if
it
were
actually
managing
the
payroll
system,
i'm
referring
to
situations
like
council
of
greenburg,
where
the
government
with
respect
to
a
particular
kind
of
facility
or
program
says,
we
don't
own
it,
but
we
--
it's
an
integral
part
of
a
system
that
we
are
managing,
establishing,
not
just
saying
--
not
just
to
say
all
we
care
about
is
one
kind
of
speech
we
don't
want
to
go
on
there.
if
the
government
says
we
have
--
we
want
to
be
the
manager,
the
operator
of
a
particular
kind
of
local
government
operation,
the
state
is
free
to
do
that--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--no.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
the
state
has
the
power
to
regulate.
the
question
is
if
the
state
regulation
is
in
the
form
of
a
content-based
restriction
on
speech,
can
it
elude
heightened
scrutiny?
and--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--your
honor,
functionally
that's
the
question,
but
i
think
analytically
we
don't
see
it
that
way
because
the
question
is,
as
we
see
it,
is
the
state,
with
regard
to
this
challenged
statute
in
its
application
to
the
local
governments,
acting
in
a
capacity
that
entitles
it
to
be
free
from
the
normal
first
amendment
scrutiny
that
it
acknowledges
it
would
fail
--
and
that's
where
our
point
is.
the
reason
it
is
free
from
that
scrutiny
as
to
its
own
employees
is
because
of
the
cases
that
say
the
government
doesn't
have
to
spend
its
money.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
well,
justice
breyer,
the
--
the
concept
of
content
discrimination
may
blur
on
some
edges,
but
one
thing
that
the
court
has
been
clear
on
is
that
when
a
government
says
speech
--
one
form
of
speech
will
not
be
allowed
and
that
will
be
political
speech,
that
is
treated
as
requiring
heightened
scrutiny.
and
i
should
say--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
all
of
those
would
pass
muster
either
because--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--they
would
pass
muster
either
because
they
are
within
exceptions
to
heightened
scrutiny
--
because
not
all
content
distinctions
require
heightened
scrutiny
--
or
they
would
pass
muster
even
under
heightened
scrutiny.
but
one
kind
of
content
distinction
that
the
court
consistently
has
indicated
requires
heightened
scrutiny
is
in
--
well,
in
burson,
a
majority
court
at
least,
you
can
talk
about
anything
you
want
near
the
polling
place
but
not
politics.
that
was
content.
consolidated
edison
--
you
can
talk
about
anything
--
billing
envelopes
but
not
controversial
issues.
davenport,
very
recently
--
from
fees
that
individuals
are
required
to
pay
to
you
--
and
in
this
case
we
are
not
talking
about
any
compelled
fees
--
but
with
compelled
fees,
you
can
use
them
for
anything
you
want
but
not
politics.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
well,
two
points
in
response
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
we
are
not
the
ones
who
say
that
this
must
be
looked
at
under
forum
analysis.
we'd
be
quite
happy,
and
i
think
the
most
sensible
way
actually
to
approach
the
case
is
that
this
is
a
content
distinction,
and
it's
presumptively
invalid,
and
there
is
no
sufficient
justification.
the
other
side
says
wait
a
minute;
there
is
a
line
of
cases
that
says
that
when
there
is
a
forum
involved
of
the
government,
and
the
government
is
restricting
speech
in
that
forum,
there
can
be
an
exception
to
heightened
scrutiny.
in
davenport--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--what
we
say
as
the
state
employees,
justice
alito,
is
that
if
falls
under
the
regan-findley
line
of
cases;
that
you
don't
even
get
to
a
first
amendment
scrutiny
because
it's
under
the
doctrine
that
when
the
government
says
we
won't
spend
our
money
on
something,
that's
not
an
infringement
of
speech
in
the
first
place.
and
interestingly--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--if
the
state
said
you
can't
use
our
money
for
payroll
deductions
of
this
kind
then
it
would
arguably
be
into
that
category.
but
i
think
what's
important
to
recognize--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--because,
your
honor,
i
think
the
courts
never
applied
the
regan
subsidization
analysis
in
that
kind
of--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--it
shouldn't--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--for
the
following
reason,
i
think,
justice
souter.
that
--
the
doctrine
that
says
when
a
government
is
refusing
to
subsidize
something
there
is
no
violation
in
the
first
place
in
the
first
amendment,
and
therefore
except
in
the
rarest,
rarest
of
cases
--
the
rarest
of
cases
there
can
be
no
first
amendment
claim;
that's
very
powerful
medicine
and
it
turns
on
the
notion
that
--
somewhat
alike
but
different
from
in
detail
the
proprietor
concept
--
but
it
turns
on
the
notion
that
the
government
is
making
judgments
about
how
its
money
is
going
to
be
used.
it
decides
what
it
wants
its
money
to
be
used
for,
and
we
are
going
to
honor
that--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--no,
i--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--now--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--the
--
even
characterizing
--
even
characterizing
it
that
way,
the
reason
that
i
think
the
analysis
breaks
down
as
to
applying
subsidization
law,
is
that
the
subsidization
law
doctrine,
subsidization
doctrine
--
regan
and
those
cases
--
as
the
court
has
explained
it,
it
is
to
protect
the
prerogatives
of
the
government
that
is
making
decisions
about
how
it
wants
particular
programs
to
be
operated.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
but
the
difference
for
first
amendment
analysis,
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
why
i
think
the
subsidization
doctrine
has
been
confined
in
the
areas
it's
been
confined,
is
when
we
are
talking
in
this
case,
for
example,
about
the
state,
the
state
determines
whether
it's
going
to
have
a
payroll
deduction
system.
it
determines
whether
it's
going
to
allow
deductions
for
charities;
whether
it's
going
to
allow
deductions
for
this
that
and
the
other.
it
determines
who
--
who's
going
to
administer
the
program,
how
expensive
it's
going
to
be,
all
of
those
things.
its
money
is
going
into
that
program
and
it
is
as
to
that
program
making
all
of
these
decisions
about
how
its
money
is
going
to
be
spent.
that
is
--
and
if
the
course
of
that
it
says
we
don't
want
this
one,
this
element
as
part
of
it
just
as
we
do
want
charitable,
we
don't
want
political;
maybe
we
don't
want
charitable
either
--
it
is
a
different
situation
in
items
of
basic
first
amendment
analysis,
i
believe,
if
you
have
a
government
that's
saying
we
don't
care
anything
about
government
payroll
systems.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
your
honor,
we
conceded
that
reluctantly
under
the
view
that
where
the
question
is
whether
the
state
--
our
claim
against
the
state
would
say
we
are
--
we
are
going
to
require
the
state
to
start
devoting
money
that
it
doesn't
want
to
spend
as
we
--
we
have
chosen
given
the
force
of
cases
like
regan,
not
to
make
that
contention,
but
to
accept
the
ruling
that
the
state's
refusal
to
spend
money
on
its
own
programs
is
in
a
different
category.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
if
it
were
clear
that
as
to
what
kinds
of
reasons
are
considered
impermissible
under
subsidization--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--well,
in
davenport,
your
honor,
the
court
did
indicate
that
a
statute
that
applies
to
public
and
private,
even
though
it's
a
unitary
statute,
you
have
to
analyze
it
separately
in
the
two
contexts.
but
our
point,
though
--
i
think
the
point
that
is
being
lost,
we
don't
see
this
as
a
question
about
what
can
the
state
do
with
respect
to
its
own
operations
as
such
and
what
can
it
do
with
respect
to
local
government
operations.
we
see
it
as
a
case
that
asks
the
question
whether
a
content
distinction
directed
at
certain
kinds
of
political
activities
that
would
normally
require
heightened
scrutiny
gets
the
pass
from
that
scrutiny
because
it's
in
a
"forum"?
and
we
--
our
position
is
quite
simply
that
if
the
state
were,
in
fact,
managing
these
local
government
payroll
systems,
which
it
would
have
a
perfect
right
to
do,
that
then
it
could
avail
itself
of
that
analysis,
but
because
it
doesn't,
it
cannot.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
because
i
think
the
difference
here,
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
case
law,
is
that
when
the
state
is
simply
saying
we
choose
not
to
spend
our
own
money
on
this
activity,
it
does
not
have
the
same
burden
of
explaining
why
it's
made
that
choice
that
it
has
when
it
reaches
out
and
says,
and
by
the
way,
we
don't
want
local
government
or
even
private
government--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--and
we
have
no
quarrel
at
all
with
that
notion.
our
position
in
no
way
dictates,
in
no
way
has
the
first
amendment
dictating
how
a
state
is
going
to
structure
its
government.
it
simply
says,
look,
we
begin
with
the
proposition
that
normally
this
restriction
on
political
speech
would
be
heightened
to
public
scrutiny.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
if
the
--
if
the
state
wants
to
have
a
uniform
law
for
itself
--
for
public
employer
--
employees,
its
own
employees
and
local
government
employees
because
of
some
unitary
interest
that
the
state
wants
to
pursue,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
state
pursuing
that
objective.
but
when
it
does
it
through
restricting
political
speech,
it
has
to
either
satisfy
heightened
scrutiny
or
come
within
one
of
the
exceptions.
and
the
distinction
--
maybe
i
can
put
it
this
way,
justice
kennedy.
the
reason
why
for
first
amendment
scrutiny
analysis,
there
is
a
sharp
distinction
in
this
case
between
what
the
state's
treatment
of
its
own
employees
and
the
state
treatment
of
local
governments
is
--
i
think
it's
basically
threefold.
that,
first,
when
the
state
says,
we
don't
choose
to
allow
certain
speech
in
our
own
forum,
it
is
simply
declining
to
facilitate
speech
that
couldn't
take
place
without
an
affirmative
grant.
when
it
says
to
local
governments,
who
in
the
state
of
nature
can
allow
whatever
they
want
in
the
way
of
speech,
when
it
says
that
there
we
will
not
allow
these
kinds
of
deductions,
it's
blocking
speech
that
would
take
place
but
for
the
government's
intervention.
and
so--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--i
just
meant
that
no
--
it's
this
simple,
justice
kennedy,
and
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
for
someone
to
get
access
to
political
--
to
a
payroll
deduction
system
of
the
state
government,
it
needs
an
affirmative
grant
from
the
state.
to
have
access
to
the
use
of
payroll
deduction
from
local
governments,
it
doesn't
need
an
affirmative
grant
from
the
state.
it
simply
needs
the
state
not
to
interfere
and
reject
the
local
government.
so
it's
--
it's
a
different
kind
of
action.
but
equally
important,
the
basis
for
the
kind
of
relaxed
scrutiny
that
the
--
that
the
petitioners
have
argued
for,
the
forum
cases
like
cornelius,
et
cetera,
those
are
all
situations
where
a
government,
that
is,
that
has
established
and
managed
a
facility
is
determining
on
a
day-to-day
basis
what's
the
purpose
of
our
program,
what
are
we
going
to
allow--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--it's
fine
with
me,
but
if
you
analyze
it
in
any
way
that
says
that
heightened
scrutiny
is
applicable
and
there
is
no
exception--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
mr.
collins
--
the
problem
with
constitutional
condition
--
if
it
were
a
condition
on
the
local
governments,
then
it's
not
really--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
the
--
well,
there
are
exceptions
to
heightened
scrutiny
where
the
government
is
acting
as
a
proprietor.
there
are
exceptions
to
heightened
scrutiny
where
the
government--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--well,
if
the
government
is
allowing
other
speech
it
would
be
heightened
scrutiny.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
it
--
if
it's
--
if
it's
commercial
speech,
it
might
fall
under
a
different
standard.
it
would
easily
pass
it
is
the
point.
i
mean,
this
is
no
question
that
a
lot
of
situations
easily
pass
heightened
scrutiny,
and
a
lot
of
circumstances
are
an
exception.
and
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
the
petitioner's
sole
submission--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--it
basically
would
trigger
the
--
the
heightened
scrutiny
except
where
the
government
is
involved.
when
the
government
is
involved
in
managing
employees
in
just
as
when
it's
managing
a
forum,
there
--
there
could
be
a
different
analysis.
but
the
problem
--
where
the
shoe
doesn't
fit
the
petitioner's
are
trying
to
put
on
this
case
is
petitioner's
concede
everything
there
is
to
concede
about
this
case
and
then
say
but
it's
just
like
cornelius,
and
it's
just
the
government
deciding
what
to
do
with
its
own
programs.
and
our
point
is
quite
simply
that
unlike
every
case
where
the
court
has
applied
relaxed
scrutiny
in
a
proprietary
situation,
this
is
a
case
where
the
government
does
not
play
any
role
with
respect
to
the
--
to
limit
the
speech.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
if
i
may
answer
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice?
it's
correct
that
where
a
law
is
based
on
employee
behavior,
that
other
kinds
of
scrutiny
can
be
involved.
darcetti
is,
obviously
if
it's
speech
in
your
capacity
of
doing
your
job.
but
the
hatch
act
cases,
letter
carriers
use
the
pickering
balance.
that's
not
a
mere
reasonableness
test
by
a
long
shot.
that's
a
comparison
as
in
the
nt
--
national
treasury
employees
honoraria
case,
same
situation,
a
balancing
test
between
the
harm
that's
perceived
from
allowing
the
speech
and
the
benefits
of
the
speech
to
the
individual.
so,
there
can
be
that
separate
analysis,
which
if
it
were
applied
here,
the
state
would
also
fail.
the
state,
it
says
it
only
prevails
under
a
reasonableness
test.
but
none
of
those
are
near
reasonableness
analyses.
