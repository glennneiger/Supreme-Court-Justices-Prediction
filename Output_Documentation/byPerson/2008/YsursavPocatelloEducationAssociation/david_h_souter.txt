no.
please.
justice

and
don't
--
don't
you
suffer
from
--
doesn't
your
position
suffer
from
a
--
a
more
serious
problem
that
doesn't
even
implicate
the
pre-emption
doctrine?
and
that
is,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
the
--
the
local
governments
are
creatures
of
the
state.
their
powers
are
the
powers
that
the
state
gives
them
by
statute,
as
--
as
you
were
pointing
out.
the
same
thing
is
true
for
corporations.
corporations
are
creatures
of
the
state.
they
have
the
powers,
and
only
the
powers,
that
the
state
gives
to
them.
it
--
it
seems
to
me,
going
back
to
justice
stevens's
initial
question,
that
i
don't
see
where
the
distinction
lies
between
the
--
in
effect,
the
position
of
the
local-government
units
and
corporations,
and
--
and
between
the
local-government
units
and
the
corporations.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
problem
for
you
quite
apart
from
any
application
of
federal
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
has
distinct
rights
under
the
first
amendment
if
state
law
creates
a
corporate
form
of
--
of
--
of
business
organization.
and
the
--
the
--
when
--
when
it
comes
into
existence,
it
then
does
acquire
some
rights
under
the
national
constitution.
but
if
in
the
first
instance
it's
a
creature
of
state
law,
its
powers,
generally
speaking,
are
the
powers
that
state
law
gives
it.
and
that
is
--
that
same
proposition
is
true
of
counties
and
towns
and
--
and
other
sub-state
governmental
units.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then
--
then
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
is
not
that
state
law
controls
what
it
may
do
and
defines
its
powers.
your
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
has
to
rest
upon
the
fact
that
what
it
is
doing
is
a
public,
as
opposed
to
a
private,
function.
and
that's
the
extent
of
the
argument.
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
only
distinction
that
you
can
maintain.
you
can't
maintain
the
distinction
based
upon
the
superiority
of
state
law
in
defining
the
--
the
extent
of
the
governmental
unit's
powers
and
so
on,
because
that
is
just
as
true
of
a
corporation.
so
your
distinction
has
simply
got
to
be
a
distinction
based
on
the
nature
of
the
function
that
is
being
performed.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
--
what
do
you
mean
by
the
"nature
of"--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
it's
doing
--
it's
doing
a
governmental
job.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
understand
what
that
is,
so
i
understand
that
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
--
it
--
it
is,
but
i
mean
when
you
say,
as
i
think
you
are
now
saying,
the
--
the
law
for
the
state
to
be
the
law
for
the
subdivision
because
they
are
both
governmental,
the
counter-argument
is,
in
fact,
there
are
resemblances
to
private
organizations,
too.
and
those
resemblances
are,
in
effect,
their
creation
and
definition
by
state
law;
their
enjoyment
of
the
powers,
and
only
those
powers,
which
state
law
gives
them;
so
that,
in
fact,
there
is
--
there
is
not
only
an
analogy
with
the
state
government,
there
is
an
analogy
with
private
corporations,
too.
and
the
question
is
why
should
we
choose
one
analogy
rather
than
the
other
analogy?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
another
way
of
looking
at
it
is
to
say
in
each
of
these
instances
--
whether
we
are
talking
about
the
state
taxing
in
order
to
perform
functions
at
the
state
level
or
whether
the
state
is
authorizing
taxation
for
functions
for
functions
to
be
performed
at
the
local
level
--
in
all
of
these
instances,
the
state
is
in
the
position
to
say
not
that
it
is
sort
of
our
money,
but
to
say
it
is
public
money.
and
our
decision
is
that
public
money
will
not
be
used
to
--
by
a
public
entity
to
underwrite
political
activity.
and
why
isn't
the
state
in
exactly
the
same
position
in
making
that
judgment,
whether
it's
talking
about
money
that
goes
directly
into
the
state
coffer
or
public
tax
money
that
happens
to
be
going
into
a
--
a
town
coffer?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i'm
--
i'm
asking
you
why
shouldn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
shouldn't
we,
on
the
theory
that
what
is
important
is
not
which
particular
coffer
the
penny
goes
into,
but
the
fact
that
it
is
public
money,
i.e.,
money
being
raised
from
taxpayers
under
a
statute
passed
by
the
state
authorizing
taxation;
and
it
is
going
to
--
and
its
justification
for
taxation
is
the
performance
of
public
functions.
and
if
the
state
can
say
it
is
not
a
proper
public
function
when
the
money
is
being
filtered
through
our
particular
treasury,
why
isn't
it
equally
valid
for
the
state
legislature
to
say
that
when
the
money
is
being
filtered
through
a
local
treasury?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
what
you're
saying
is,
i
--
you're
saying
in
effect
that
i
--
that
you
reject
my
--
my
hypothetical
assumption
here,
that
what
we
ought
to
regard
as
the
proper
characterization
of
the
money
is
not
"our"
state
money,
but
public
money
raised
under
a
system
of
public
taxation;
and
you're
saying
you
should
not
go
--
you
should
not
characterize
the
funds
that
way.
of
course
that's
your
position--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
if
you
do
characterize
the
funds
that
way,
it
seems
to
me
you're
in
trouble.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
shouldn't
i
characterize
them
that
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
state
--
the
state
legislature
is
making
a
decision
as
to
how
it
wants
the
--
the
programs
which
comprise
local
government
to
be
operated.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the
point
in
the
case
that
you
concede
that
the
government
may
make
that
choice
is
that
the
government
is
subsidizing
it
by
the
activity
which
the
government
is
refusing
to
perform.
so
it's
not
nearly
a
case
of
saying
there
shall
be
this
kind
of
speech
and
not
that
kind
of
speech.
in
each
instance
there
is
a
decision
being
made
in
my
hypothetical
that
the
government
will
not
subsidize
that
kind
of
activity,
that
kind
of
speech,
by
using
public
money.
