but
does
it
get
at
any
speech
other
than
union
speech?
i
mean
you
say,
yes,
it
is
content-based,
but
it's
viewpoint
neutral.
but
it
seems
that
what
is
banned
by
the
statute
is
union
speech.
is
any
other
organization
affected?
does
the
ban
affect
any
other
organization?
isn't
it
simply
union
speech
that's
at
stake?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
in
practice,
is
there
any
other
application?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
your
whole
argument
was
that
the
counties
are
simply
instrumentalities
of
the
state,
and
the
state
has
full
power
over
them.
it
chooses
to
delegate
to
them
autonomy,
but
it
holds
the
control
rein.
and
now
you're
saying
no,
that
the
federal
government
can
give
the
state
local-unit
authority
that
the
state,
itself,
chooses
not
to
give.
and
you
say
that's
beyond
cavil.
i
really
don't
understand
your
argument.
justice
ruth
bader

well,
if
the
state
wants
to,
it's
because
it
can
exercise
a
heavy
hand
and
control
its
local
units,
but
if
it
wants
to
give
the
local
units
discretion,
then
it
has
to
leave
it
to
the
local
units
whether
or
not
they
want
to
enact
such
a
ban.
that's
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question
really
is,
if
you
look
at
this
at
the
most
basic
level,
we
have
two
important
concessions.
you
don't
question
the
constitutionality
of
the
ban
as
to
state
employees.
and
the
other
side
doesn't
question
that
it
is
unconstitutional
as
to
private
employees.
so
here
we
have
state
local
employees.
do
we
bracket
them
with
with
state
employees
or
with
private
employees
as
essential--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--isn't
there
--
isn't
there
some
state
tax
money
that
goes
to
fund
local
units?
i
mean,
you
say
here
there
are
state
taxpayers'
funds
involved;
therefore
the
state
doesn't
have
to
pay
for
what
it
doesn't
want
to
buy.
but
are
there
state
funds
that
fund
local
government
entities?
