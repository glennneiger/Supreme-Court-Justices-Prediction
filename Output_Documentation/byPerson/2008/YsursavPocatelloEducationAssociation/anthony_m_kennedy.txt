justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
--
if
you
think
of
the
case
as
a
principal-agent
case
so
that
the
principal
can
direct
the
agent
as
to
what
to
do,
the
agent
being
the
county,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
unions
might
still
have
an
argument
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
condition.
i've
been
looking
for
ways
to
examine
this
case.
the
public
forum
doesn't
really
work
for
me.
subsidy
doesn't
really
work
for
me.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
an
unconstitutional-condition
case.
at
least
that's
the
argument.
that
doesn't
mean
you
necessarily
can't
prevail.
but
suppose
the
state
told
the
city:
you
can't
have
a
parade
that
you
sponsor
for
this
particular
cause.
that
would
raise
an
unconstitutional-conditions
argument;
wouldn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
it?
and
i
say
that
because
i
think
that
follows
on
justice
stevens's
line
of
questioning.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
him,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is
consistent
with
what
he
is
asking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
stand
up
and
say
that
this
isn't
viewpoint
--
that
this
is
--
that
this
is
viewpoint-based.
isn't
it
where
the
union
--
and
aren't
they
right
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
general
proposition
that
underlies
your
argument
that
the
local
entities
are
creatures
of
state
law
and
they
cannot
receive
federal
powers
from
the
federal
government
when
the
states
object,
is
that
--
is
that
an
acceptable
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
is
--
there
is
a
case
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
it
was
affirmed
by
this
court
on
a
procedural
point,
but
not
on
a
--
not
on
the
merits
--
out
of
the
neighboring
state
of
washington,
where
the
state
says
a
locality
cannot
build
a
dam
more
than
25
feet
high.
the
locality
then
gets
a
license
from
the
federal
power
commission,
and
the
state
said,
well,
you
still
don't
have
this
authority.
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
you
do.
the
federal
power
then
supersedes.
would
you
agree
that
that
case
is
valid?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
there
the
local
entity
has
powers
greater
than
what
the
state
wants
to
give
it,
even
over
the
state's
objection.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
really,
if
the
state
can
--
can
opt
not
to
do
something,
it
can't
tell
its
subdivisions,
we
don't
want
you
to
do
it,
either?
and
the
subdivision
can
then
go
to
the
--
directly
to
the
federal
government
and
say,
please
let
us
do
this,
even
if
the
state
would
be
free
to
reject
it
on
its
own?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
argument
you
should
be
making
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let
me
just
establish
something
at
the
outset.
you
had
conceded
below,
and
i
thought
i
saw
this
in
your
brief
as
well,
that
as
to
the
state
of
idaho,
its
determination
not
to
allow
the
deductibility
is
permissible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so,
we
begin
with
the
proposition
that
a
state
may
do
this
if
it
chooses;
i.e.,
this
--
refused
on
its
own
to
have
the
payroll
deduction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
--
and
if
a
state
had
a
system
in
which
all
payroll
deductions
were
--
by
local
entities
--
were
routinely
controlled
by
the
state,
the
state
did
all
the
pay
roles
for
the
local
entities,
then
it
--
in
that
case
the
nondeductibility
would
also
be
permitted,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
state
at
the
state
level
says
this
is
a
contentious
area,
we
want
to
stay
out
of
it.
we
are
going
to
be
neutral.
we
are
simply
not
allowing
payroll
deduction
for
right
to
work
clauses,
for
union
clauses.
we
don't
want
this.
if
the
state
can
say
that,
and
your
concession
indicates
to
me
that
it
can,
then
why
can't
it
tell
its
subdivisions
you
have
to
be
efficient,
we
don't
want
arguments
from
one
city
to
the
next
city
about
payroll
deduction
that's
going
to
consume
the
time
of
the
city
council's,
the
time
of
the
citizens,
we
want
to
take
this
off
the
table
for
you
just
the
way
we've
taken
it
off
the
table
for
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
that's
the
interest.
this
is
a
very
strong
federal
interest
in
allowing
the
states
to
organize
their
governmental
systems
the
way
they
choose.
our
gun
control
registration
case,
where
we
said
the
federal
government
cannot
tell
the
counties
that
it
has
certain
duties
for
gun
control.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
i'm
not
sure
the
state
isn't
saying
we
want
to
determine
how
our
government
is
structured
in
this
respect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'll
read
russo
again,
but
i
didn't
think
pocatello,
idaho,
was
part
of
the
state
of
major.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
help
me
with
this?
would
you
object
if
we
analyzed
this
as
a
constitutional
condition
case?
i
don't
know
that
you
would
prevail
or
not.
but
it
--
the
forum
analysis
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
quite
fit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
that?
[laughter]
