justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
in
fact
there
is
a
charity,
which
charity
in
idaho
is
a
charity
that
makes
all
of
its
contributions
to
help
support
right-to-work
laws.
all
right.
so
that
charity
goes
and
says,
could
you
--
we'd
like
a
payroll
deduction.
can
they
get
it,
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
know.
okay.
so,
then,
we
do
know
this.
we
do
know
--
what
i'm
wondering
is:
isn't
this
case,
to
me,
quite
confused
about
something
fairly
simple?
the
question
would
be:
look,
one,
do
you
or
do
you
not
in
idaho
allow
anybody
to
have
payroll
deductions
for
anything?
and
i
take
it
your
answer
to
that
question
is:
yes,
we
do
allow
some
payroll
deductions
for
some
things.
okay?
so
then
we
look
at
this
one,
and
it
says:
no
payroll
deductions
for
union
activities
that
are
political.
all
right?
now,
you
either
do
have
or
you
do
not
have
a
justification
for
that
difference.
if
you
have
a
reasonable,
or
whatever
the
sufficient
test
is,
justification
for
the
difference,
you
win.
and
if
you
don't,
you
lose.
and,
indeed,
whether
you
are
the
state
or
the
county
could
have
to
do
with
the
plausibility
of
the
justification.
here
we
are,
end
of
case,
traditional.
you
just
--
you
didn't
argue
it
that
way,
i
guess,
below.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
certainly,
i
would
think,
would
be
a
problem
if
the
right-to-work
people
can
get
there.
and
you
are
not
going
to
let
the
unions
get
there.
but
i
don't
know
the
facts.
so
shouldn't
we
just
send
this
case
back
and
say:
please
look
at
what
the
situation
is?
if
they
have
to
treat
some
people
one
way,
some
people
another,
bad;
if
they
don't,
everybody
is
treated
alike
for
good
reason,
probably
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
at
that
part,
just
where
you
are,
that
i've
always
had
a
hard
time
not
for
lack
of
trying.
i
don't
understand
what
the
word
15
times
you
can
explain
it.
and
the
thing
i
don't
understand
it
about
is
it
seems
to
me
government
engages
in
thousands
of
different
kinds
of
activity,
and
there
isn't
some
special
test.
when
they
say
that
in
the
jury
room,
the
jury
room
is
there
for
juries;
it's
not
to
show
movies
of
steven
spielberg.
and
there
isn't
some
special
test
when
you
say
the
purpose
of
the
biology
class
is
to
teach
biology,
and
we
don't
want
people
coming
in
here
teaching
some
other
thing.
i
don't
understand
what
this
special
test
called
30
seconds
or
45
seconds
to
see
if
you
can
help
me?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
--
for
example,
in
biology
class,
the
school
board
says:
you
know,
biology
teacher,
i
want
you
to
teach
biology;
i
don't
want
you
to
teach
politics.
and
then
there
is
some
special
scrutiny
about
how
the
biology
teacher
is
to
teach
or
--
but
they
say
just
face
it.
the
jury
room
is
for
juries.
it's
not
for
politics.
all
that
is
subject
to
some
special
first
amendment
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
might.
but
you
know
a
lot
of
them,
you
know
you
could
show
movies
in
jury
rooms
in
the
evening
and
people
might
find
it
much
better.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
saying
--
is
it
your
view
that
heightened
scrutiny
applies
whenever
a
government
tells
any
group
that
wants
to
raise
money
for
political
purposes
in
any
way
they
want
involving
the
government
that
it
can't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
okay.
i
thought
the
answer
would
be
no.
then,
will
you
try
to
say
in
a
sentence
or
two
if
the
answer
is
it
heightened
scrutiny
doesn't
apply
to
any
kind
of
an
effort
to
raise
money
for
political
purposes
where
they
say
to
the
government
you
got
to
help
me,
when
does
it
apply
and
when
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
you
are
making
--
say
it
always
applies
except
in
a
few
little
exceptions.
i
mean
i
know
there
is
one
for
government
speech
and
so
forth.
but
you're
saying
whenever
the
government
tells
a
person
you
can't,
for
example,
go
to
the
city
hall
and
raise
money,
you
can't
do
it
in
the
jury
room,
you
can't
raise
money
here,
you
can't
raise
money
there,
dah,
dah,
dah,
or
you
can't
speak
there,
you
can't
--
it's
always
heightened
scrutiny?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
cannot
--
you
have
to
use
heightened
scrutiny
when
the
fda,
for
example
--
you
know,
the
case
i
wrote
in
--
the
fda
says
you
cannot
advertise
on
a
label
for
a
drug.
we
don't
want
advertising.
we
don't
want
advertising
on
the
label.
that's
heightened
scrutiny.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
regulation
of
government
employees
is
the
same?
