justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
--
the
--
one
question
i
have
on
this
is
if
i
look
at
the
two
standards,
and
the
first
one,
"best
practical"
--
it
talks
about
cost-benefit.
it
says
you
shall
consider
the
total
cost
of
application
of
technology
in
relation
to
the
effluent-reduction
benefits.
then
you
look
at
"best
available",
and
they've
changed
the
phrase.
it
doesn't
get
rid
of
cost,
but
it
simply
says
you
shall
take
into
account
the
cost
of
achieving
such
effluent
reduction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
both
use
the
word
"cost".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you
look
at
what
senator
muskie
said
at
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
senator
muskie
said
at
that
time
is
the
object
here
is
when
we
move
to
better
--
to
better
technology,
we
--
you
know,
when
you
get
past
the
practical
and
you
get
into
the
other,
it
says
to
stop
considering
costs?
not
quite.
he
says:
"while
costs
should
be
a
factor
in
the
administrator's
judgment.
"
so
he
is
not
against
using
costs.
he
says
that
you
have
to
do
it
under
a
reasonableness
standard
where
you
are
taking
into
account
all
the
goals
and
so
forth.
now,
that's
ambiguous.
but,
as
i
read
it,
it
says:
of
course,
you
can't
avoid
taking
into
account
costs,
but
don't
do
it
too
much.
and,
therefore,
you
would
say:
don't
apply
one
of
these
big
formal
things
when
you
reach
your
final
goal.
there
are
other
ways
of
getting
there.
of
course,
see
that
it
isn't
absurd.
and
for
30
years
the
agency
has
had
a
way.
it
has
talked
about
"grossly
disproportionate".
now,
that's
the
whole
background
to
the
question.
my
question
is,
of
course:
why
not
let
sleeping
dogs
lie?
let
the
agency
take
into
account
the
way
it
has
done
it
to
prevent
absurd
results,
but
not
try
to
do
it
so
that
it's
so
refined
you
can't
even
take
account
of
what
a
fish
is
worth
unless
they
happen
to
be
one
of
the
1.2
percent
that
goes
to
market.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
fine.
then
what
are
you
arguing?
are
you
arguing
that
you
should
take
costs
into
account?
because
i
don't
think
--
or
i
don't
think
you
should
reach
much
disagreement
on
that
point,
that
sometimes
you
take
them
into
account--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
way
that
senator
muskie
suggested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
now,
what
they
are
going
to
argue,
i
guess,
is
going
to
be
up
to
them,
and
i'd
be
very
interested
in
hearing
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
you
would
be
satisfied
with
the
following
ruling:
the
second
circuit
went
too
far
in
saying
that
you
can
never
take
costs
into
account.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
you
can
sometimes
take
account
of
them,
and
the
standard
that
we
think
is
there
--
i'm
just
imagining
this
--
is
the
one
they
have
used
for
30
years.
is
it
grossly
disproportionate?
are
you
--
is
it
feasible?
is
it
practical?
are
you
using
costs
along
with
other
things?
how
do
you
feel
about
some
slightly
vague
thing
like
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you
are
happy
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
--
it's
simply
saying
the
second
circuit
was
wrong,
the
use
of
the
word
"cost"
is
meaningless
without
some
idea--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
what
the
costs
are
relevant
to,
but
a
--
but
a
vague,
grossly
disproportionate
test
is
okay
with
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
one
they
used
for
30
years
at
epa.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
all
right
or
not
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
how
you
can
do
that.
i
just
don't
see
it.
it's
--
i
mean,
suppose
that
the
cost
of
this
machine
is
$100,000.
now,
if
you
say
i'm
talking
about
using
that
machine
for
an
entire
industry,
you
would
say,
my
god,
that's
certainly
available.
but
see
--
but
here
i
have
just
one
part
of
the
industry
here;
i
have
a
little
plant;
and
you
know,
to
hook
that
machine
up,
it's
only
going
to
save
one
paramecium.
neither
of
us
wants
that.
and
so
the
logical
thing
to
say
is
to
say,
well,
it
isn't
available
for
that.
and
i
would
be
with
you
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
to
be
honest
about
it,
i'd
have
to
say
the
reason
it
isn't
available
is
quite
--
it
isn't
available
for
minimizing
the
--
the
harm,
that
particular
adverse
impact
which
is
killing
a
--
a
water
animal.
the
reason
it
isn't
is
because
it
doesn't
kill
any
water
animals.
well,
let
me
be
honest,
it
kills
one,
or
it
kills
two--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
it
kills
three,
and
don't
tell
me
de
minimis,
because
as
soon
as
you
say
"de
minimis",
i'm
going
to
add
one,
okay?
[laughter]
but
what
i'm
trying
to
show
here
is
that
--
that
there
--
it
isn't
meaningful
to
talk
about
cost
being
available
for
an
end,
without
some
--
about
something
not
being
available
for
an
end
in
light
of
its
costs,
unless
you
take
into
account
what
that
end
is.
i
mean,
we'd
spend
trillions
to
make
america
secure
so
not
50,000
people
die,
but
we
won't
spend
trillions
for
a
road
accident.
and
--
and
of
course
you
take
those
things
into
account.
so
that's
--
that's
exactly
the
point
i
wonder
about.
are
you
really
saying,
pay
no
attention
or
are
you
saying,
which
i
could
understand
better,
but
you
have
to
say
what
you
want
--
i
mean,
that
what
we
mean
is:
yes,
they
can
take
costs
into
account;
that's
what
they
do
under
the
comparable
standard,
best
available
technology,
but
just
use
your
head,
don't
do
it
too
much,
don't
use
it
--
like
take
other
things
into
account,
too;
don't
do
a
formal
cost-benefit
analysis;
don't
try
to
evaluate
the
paramecium.
do
the
difference
between
the
--
you
know,
the
two
standards:
best
practical,
best
available.
do
"grossly"
or
"wholly"
or
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no,
but
best
available
says
take
costs
into
account.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
there's
a
way
of
doing
that
which
is
what
i'd
call
a
commonsense
way
that
they
have
some
discretion
over,
that
doesn't
involve
some
enormously
elaborate
thing;
and
that's
what
i
am
searching
for.
i
don't
--
i
am
not
sitting
here
with
an
answer.
i'm
trying
to
find
a
way
of
making
sense
of
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
those
two
things
seem
contrary
to
me.
i
don't
see
how
you
could
--
do
you
see
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
how
is
it
--
how
is
it
feasible
if
it
has
no
benefits
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
we
are
going
to
reach
our
insane
results.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can't
make
any
other
judgment.
so
imagine
the
consequence
of
that
environmentally.
they
can't
make
any
other
judgment.
suppose
the
epa
is
right:
it's
going
to
add
20
electric
plants,
huge
plants,
purely
to
save
the
fish,
and
the
result
is
the
cost
of
electricity
goes
up,
and
the
result
is
there
are
no
electric
cars
because
people
make
the
comparison
with
oil,
and
now
they
have
to
have
petrol.
i
mean,
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
senator
muskie
would
have
written
a
statute
that
would
have
foreseen
such
an
effect.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
where
i
agree
with
you.
so
i
go
back
to
page
170
of
the
legislative
history,
which
i
have
read
now
six
times,
and
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
not
totally
clear.
maybe
you
think
it
is.
but
it
seemed
to
me
what
he
is
saying
there
is
just
what
you've
said:
don't
go
into
this
with
some
elaborate
thing,
but
remember
costs
are
still
relevant.
and
what
i've
been
searching
for
throughout
is
a
set
of
words
that
would
help
me
translate
that
thought
into
a
legal
reality.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
what
about
the
particular
case?
what
they
said
here
is
that,
if
you
require
the
closed
circuit
for
everybody,
we
are
going
to
have
to
build
--
we
are
going
to
have
to
pay
an
energy
penalty
of
2.4
to
5.3
percent.
you
will
have
to
build
20
additional
400-megawatt
plants,
which
is
huge,
many,
many,
many
billions
of
dollars,
and
the
--
just
to
replace
the
capacity
you
have
lost.
and
the
result,
which
seems
quite
logical,
would
be
to
increase
by
a
lot,
not
just
a
little,
the
consumption
of
fossil
fuel.
well,
now
how
are
they
not
--
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
they
can't
take
that
into
account,
which,
for
an
environmental
agency,
i
would
have
thought,
"but
they
must
take
it
into
account.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
they
did
exactly
the
same
thing
they've
done,
which
i've
just
read
you,
and
they
put
a
label
on
it,
instead
of
saying
"thinking
of
benefits",
we
were
calling
it
now
"taking
into
account
environmental
impacts",
then
they
could
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
that
thought,
and
this
is
what's
concerning
me,
but
there
may
be
a
very
good
answer.
a
lot
remains
to
be
done
with
epa.
they
have
an
enormous
job
to
do.
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
get
them
tied
up
in
unnecessary
red
tape,
where
everybody
is
suddenly
taking
them
to
court
on
rather
technical
things.
so
if
this
170
--
read
it
out
of
the
"available
technology"
definition,
you
can
take
costs
into
account;
just
don't
do
it
in
this
other
way.
i
can
see
how
they
could
work
with
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i'm
worried
about
what
you
are
saying.
it
may
make
it
so
difficult
for
them
that
they
won't
be
able
to
do
the
job.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
page
--
the
page
of
the
legislative
history
or
the
page
of
the
text
of
the
statute
that
says
what
i
think
is
a
--
i
mean,
try
it
with
your
son.
it
costs
$100.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
son
says,
100>
["].
you
say,
"that's
too
expensive".
he
says,
"but
i
didn't
tell
you
what
it
was
for.
"
what?
[laughter]
i
mean
--
you
see?
now
you
tell
me
the
page,
and
i
have
read
a
lot
of
it;
tell
me
the
page
of
the
legislative
history
or
the
phrase
of
the
statute
where
it
says
what
you
just
said
--
that
you
cannot
take
into
account
what
you
were
buying
for
that
$100.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
page?
i
will
read
it
again.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
316(b).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
was
the
house
side,
which
the
house
side
was
against
that.
and
the
--
the
question
i
have
from
your
point
of
view
is
--
is
the
obverse
question:
if
you
look
at
this
particular
cost-benefit
analysis,
i
mean,
it
goes
through
all
these
things
which,
they
don't
know
what
the
numbers
are,
nobody
knows
what
the
values
of
the
fishes
are,
which
98
percent
are
never
even
eaten,
they
are
fast
swimmers
or
whatever.
[laughter]
but
they
--
the
--
you
see
the
point
here.
that
all
of
his
fears,
your
--
your
opponent,
brother
here,
seem
to
be
manifest
in
this
kind
of
a
document
which,
if
you
do
read
senator
muskie,
seems
to
be
the
very
thing
he
was
against.
so
--
so
what
is
--
i
am
still
left
with
your
suggestion
of
what
to
do,
other
than
just,
"well,
it's
all
fine".
