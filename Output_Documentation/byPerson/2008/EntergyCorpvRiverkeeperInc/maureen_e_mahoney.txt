ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
with
just
setting
the
stage
here.
for
almost
30
years
now,
the
executive
branch
has
had
an
executive
order
through
all
administrations
that
requires
a
cost-benefit
analysis
to
be
done
whenever
regulations
are
adopted.
and
that's
because
the
executive
branch
considers
that
to
be
just
an
essential
component
of
reasoned
decisionmaking.
so
this
court
should
not
be
quick
to
conclude
that
congress
intended
to
deprive
the
agency
of
the
tools
that
it
needs
to
come
up
with
reasoned
answers
to
these
vexing
problems
in
the
absence--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
it
is
a
chevron
case,
your
honor.
we
think
--
certainly
think
it
could
be
resolved
under
step
one,
meaning
the
following:
can
you
read
the
statute
reasonably
to
say
that
congress
unambiguously
foreclosed
cost-benefit
analysis
under
316(b)?
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
your
honor,
but
that's--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--they
do.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
yes.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
we
are
not
arguing
that
you
have
to
do
monetized
cost-benefit
analysis,
nor
did
the
agency
say
that
it
was
basing
its
rule
on--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--but,
your
honor,
the
--
the
second
circuit
held,
and
respondents
argue,
that
the
benefits
have
to
be
essentially
the
same
before
you
can
look
at
the
cost
of
the
technology.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
but
that's
what
the
second
circuit
held--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
your
honor--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
something
like
that,
as
long
as
it
is
clear
that
costs
can
be--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
as
long
as
costs
can
be
compared
to
benefits,
and
the
second
circuit
said
they
could
not
be;
that
the
benefits
have
to
be
essentially
the
same.
that's
what
"cost-effectiveness
analysis"
means.
of
course
the
statute
doesn't
say
"cost-effectiveness".
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
of
comparison.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
if--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--vague,
grossly
disproportionate--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--your
honor,
i
think
the
point
is--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
if
for
30
years
they
have
not
been
mandating
closed-cycle
cooling
under
that
standing
--
standard,
so
from
the
industry's
perspective,
that
probably
is
an
acceptable
standard.
but
the
real
point
here
is
that
when
we
start
talking
about
what
degree
can
you
compare
the
costs,
is
it
significantly
greater
than,
is
it
wholly
disproportionate,
that's
exactly
where
chevron
comes
in.
if
everyone
concludes
that
you
can
compare
costs
to
benefits,
then
certainly
the
agency
should
have
some
flexibility.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
it
should
be
the
same
standard
as
the
--
what
i
think
you're
referring
to
as
the
b-a-t
standard,
which
governs
discharges
of
even
toxic
pollutants,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
not
necessarily
by
any
means,
because
the
acronyms
are
similar,
but
the
text
isn't.
that
standard
actually
talks
about
the
goal
of
eliminating
discharges.
congress
did
not
say
eliminate
all
impingement
and
entrainment.
to
the
contrary.
they
could
have;
they
didn't.
they
said
minimize
adverse
environmental
impact,
which
is
necessarily
a
broad
delegation
of
discretion
to
the
agency.
in
addition,
that
standard--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--wholly
disproportionate,
your
honor,
has
been
the
test.
that's
what
has
been
used.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
wholly
disproportionate,
not
grossly
disproportionate.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
the
point
is
that
i
--
i
think
what
i
am
happy
with
is
saying
that
the
agency
should
have
discretion
to
formulate
what
test
it's
going
to
use.
but
under
the
wholly
disproportionate
test--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
i
just
think
that
it's
hard
to
get
that
out
of
the
language.
when
--
when
it
doesn't
come
straight
out
of
the
language
"wholly
disproportionate",
then
you
ought
to
leave
it
to
the
agency.
but
here--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--well,
they
haven't.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
under
a
wholly
disproportionate
standard,
your
honor?
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
under
the
statute,
i
doubt
it.
it
would
probably
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
but
--
and
--
and
let
me
explain
why.
the
statute
talks
about
minimizing
adverse
environmental
impact,
and
it's
important
to
understand
what
the
epa
did
here.
at
page
169a
of
the
appendix,
they
say:
"we
are
using
impingement
and
entrainment
as
a
quick
and
convenient
metric.
"
in
other
words,
we
are
going
to
make
you
reduce
impingement
and
entrainment
to
the
--
to
a
very
large
extent,
get
it
down,
you
know,
close
to
zero
if
we
can,
whatever.
but
that's
not
because
it
is
itself
adverse
environmental
impact.
they
say
they
didn't
define
it
at
287a.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
well,
here's
--
here's
how
i
would
say
it,
your
honor.
there
may
be
some
locations
where
that
--
where
it
would
not
be
wholly
disproportionate.
if
--
if
for
some
reason
you
couldn't
design
an
alternative
system
that
would
protect,
for
instance,
a
balanced
population
of
fish
in
that
water
body,
then
it
might
be
that
--
that
--
that
closed-cycled
cooling
would
be
required.
but
on
a
national
basis,
at
355a,
the
agency
said
that
they
understood
that
reducing
impingement
and
entrainment
at
the
ranges
they
were
talking
about
would
not
be
justified
in
many
locations
across
the
country.
and
that's
because
power
plants
may
be
impinging
numbers
of
fish
that
aren't
actually
harming
that
water
body.
fish
have
the
potential
to
procreate
in
very
substantial
numbers.
some
fish
spawn
500,000
eggs
in
a
year.
and,
so,
if
the
--
and
throughout
the
act,
even
under
316a,
for
instance,
congress
has
said
that,
even
with
respect
to
thermal
discharges,
you
can
get
variances
if
you
can
show
that
you
are
not
harming
a
balanced
population
of
fish
in
the
water
body.
so
given
that,
given
the
variances
throughout
the
act
and
even,
you
know,
these
kinds
of
limits
on
the
discharge
standards,
which
are
designed
to
protect
human
health,
why
would
you
read
the
mandate
for
the
maximum
technology
on
intake
structures
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
human
health,
nothing.
it
is
just
to
protect
fish
in
the
water
body.
so,
it
doesn't
make
sense
that
in
a
single
sentence
added
in
conference
in
a
voluminous
act
about
discharges
of
pollutants,
that
congress
would
mandate
the
maximum
technology
for--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--because,
your
honor,
i
don't
think--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--here's
why,
your
honor:
because
the
most
significant
comparison
between
this
statutory
section
and
the
others
is
they
didn't
list
any
of
the
factors.
all
of
the
other
sections
have
--
have
a
detailed
list
of
considerations
that
the
agency
must
take
into
account.
this
one
says
nothing.
this
is
not
an
example
of
where--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
--
i
don't
think
that's
the
most
reasonable
inference
because
it
would
lead
to
very
irrational
results,
200-foot
cooling
towers
in
--
in
--
in
town
--
in
historic
old
towns--
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
where
in
the
language
you
can
get
allowance
to
take
into
account
things
like
energy
impacts.
why?
if
congress
gave
a
complete
and
full
standard,
why
can
we
take
into
account
aesthetic
harm,
navigational
harm,
energy
impact?
it
doesn't
allow
for
that,
and
i
think
it
doesn't
allow
for
that
because
congress
intended
the
agency
to
define
the
terms
in
a
reasonable
way.
ms.
maureen
e.
mahoney
thank
you.
