chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
07-588,
entergy
corporation
v.
riverkeeper
incorporated,
and
the
consolidated
cases.
mr.
joseffer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
in
the
other
provision,
it
specifically
required
consideration
of
costs
and
benefits
and
it
didn't
do
so
in
this
provision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
get
back
to
your
television
hypothetical,
if
you
told
somebody
that
you
were
going
to
buy
the
best
tv
available,
nobody
would
think
you
meant
that,
you
know,
you
were
going
to
buy
a
very
cheap
tv
because,
considering
the
costs
and
benefits,
that
was
the
best
one.
they
would
think
you
are
going
to
get,
you
know,
the
fanciest
tv
you
could.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
mahoney.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
lazarus.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
exactly
what
they
did
here
in
listing
what
they
called
a
suite
of
technologies
or
approaches
that
is
available?
i
thought
that
was
exactly
what
they
did.
they
said
for
different
locations,
different
technologies
may
be
the
best
available.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
your
argument
is
focused
on
proving
that
your
interpretation
won't
lead
to
insane
results,
as
you
put
it.
but
you've
got
to
do
a
lot
more
than
that.
i
mean,
you
have
to
establish
that
this
is
not
ambiguous
language.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
you
get
to
that,
money
in
the
bank,
does
this
mean
that
best
technology
available
changes
over
time?
i
mean,
maybe
the
industry
could
have
borne
these
costs
two
years
ago,
but
they
probably
can't
today.
nobody
has
money
in
the
bank
today.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
they
could
have
said,
two
years
ago,
this
is
what
you
have
to
do,
but
today
they
would
say
you
don't
have
to
do
that
anymore--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--even
though
the
technology
is
still
available.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
would
have
to
agree,
wouldn't
you,
that
the
panel's
decision
in
this
case
overruled
the
prior
panel's
decision,
in
judge
katzmann's
opinion
in
riverkeeper
i?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
riverkeeper
i,
what
judge
katzmann
said
is
that
we
think
the
epa
was
permitted
to
consider
costs
and
energy
efficiency
in
determining
the
best
technology
available.
so
he
was
deciding
it
on
the
basis
of
availability,
too.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
joseffer,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-588,
entergy
corporation
versus
riverkeeper,
incorporated,
and
the
consolidated
cases.
