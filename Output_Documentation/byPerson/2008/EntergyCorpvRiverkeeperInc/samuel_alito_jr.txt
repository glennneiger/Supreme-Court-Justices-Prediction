samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
in
your
enumeration
of
three
reasons,
but
i
just
don't
see
how
you
get
cost
into
the
concept
of
availability.
it
doesn't
fit
in
there
any
better
than
it
does
under
"best".
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
not
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word.
if
i
look
in
the
real
estate
page
of
the
--
of
the
50
million.
now,
that
would
be
available
to
me.
i
couldn't
afford
it,
but
it
would
be
available.
so
i
just
don't
see
how
cost
can
be
fit
into
that
concept
of
availability.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
have
a
--
you
have
a
good
argument
based
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
think,
that
costs
cannot
be
taken
into
account
at
all.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
at
all.
but
once
you
concede
that
it
can
be
taken
into
account
at
all,
then
i
don't
see
why
you're
not
in
chevron
step
2.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
once
the
foot
is
in
the
door
i
don't
see
how
you
can--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--right.
but--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--when
you
say
whether
the
industry
can
afford
it,
does
that
take
into
account
at
all
the
effect
on
the
price
that
consumers
have
to
pay?
if
the
effect
of
achieving
a
very
small
gain
in
protecting
fish
is
to
increase
electricity
costs
10
times,
is
that
something
that
cannot
be
taken
into
account?
