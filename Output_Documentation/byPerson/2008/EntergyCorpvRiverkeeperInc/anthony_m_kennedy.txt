well,
my
--
i
think
maybe
what
justice
ginsburg
was
beginning
to
get
at
is
my
question
here.
i
assume
that
bta
is
the
most
rigorous
of
the
standards
set
forth
in
the
statute.
you
can
argue
with
that
assumption,
but
then
grant
me
the
assumption
for
the
moment.
if
bta
is
more
rigorous
than
the
other
standards,
what
is
it
in
the
regulations
that
reflects
the
agency's
concurrence
with
that?
what
is
there
in
the
agency
regulations
that
indicates
that
there
is
a
more
rigorous
examination
under
bta
than
the
other
standards?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
didn't
it
use
bpt
or
--
or
one
--
one
of
the
other
standards?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
they
are
different,
then
one
--
then
it's
either
less
rigorous
or
more
rigorous.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
this
is
a
chevron
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
--
could
the
agency
mandate
a
closed-cycle
system,
recirculating
system--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--for
old
plants?
could
they
--
under
your
view,
could
the
agency,
given
its
chevron
latitude,
mandate
closed
circulation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
under
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
--
it
seems
to
me
--
of
course,
there
are
limits
on
what
the
agency
can
do,
but
if
it
couldn't
mandate
the
closed
circulation
system
--
i
think
i've
got
the
term
right
--
if
it
could
not
do
that,
then
this
is
not
--
you're
backing
away
from
chevron,
it
seems
to
me.
