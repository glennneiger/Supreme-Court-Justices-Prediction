the
second
circuit
recognized
that
latter
kind
of
taking
account
of
costs
disproportionate,
more
than
the
industry
would
bear,
and
they
also
recognized
a
cost
comparison.
if
you
have
a
cheaper
method
that
is
almost
as
good,
you
can
use
that
and
you
don't
have
to
use
the
one
that
will
capture
the
extra
fish.
so
everybody
agrees
that
there
is
some
consideration
of
cost.
the
question
is
how
much,
and
the
concern
is,
as
justice
souter
said,
that
you
are
comparing
things
that
aren't
comparable.
justice

does
it
make
any
difference--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
have
the
two
labels:
bpt,
"best
practical",
and
then
"best
available".
and
isn't
it
so
that
the
best
available
technology,
thinking
of
the
clean
air
act,
what
they
call
bat>
["],
is
considered
the
most
technology-forcing
standard,
and
then
there
are
lesser
standards?
but
you
seem
to
think
that
these
can
be
synonyms.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
would
have
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
it
would
have
said
"available
to
reduce"?
if
"for
minimizing"
is
no
stronger
than
if
it
had
said
"available"
--
if
it
meant
what
you
suggest,
why
didn't
it
read
"available
to
reduce"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
an
ambiguity
the
government
said
it
could
live
with.
now,
the
government
advised
this
court
not
to
grant
cert
in
this
case,
isn't
that
so?
