mr.
daryl
joseffer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
more
than
30
years,
epa
has
construed
the
clean
water
act
to
permit
it
to
consider
the
relationship
between
costs
and
benefits
in
setting
limits
on
water
intake.
the
court
of
appeals'
unprecedented
limitation
of
that
discretion
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
basic
chevron
interpretive
principles
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first,
the
controlling
statutory
standard,
which
looks
to
the
best
technology
available
for
minimizing
adverse
environmental
impacts,
is
ambiguous
and
does
not
preclude
epa's
interpretation,
especially
in
light
of
the
statute's
other
"best
technology"
provisions,
two
of
which
expressly
require
consideration
of
the
relationship
between
costs
and
benefits.
second,
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
determined
for
itself
that
the
benefits
of
stricter
regulations
would
in
fact
outweigh
their
costs.
instead,
from
both
the
context
--
i'm
sorry,
for
--
i'm
sorry.
there
is
no
indication
in
either
the
context
or
the
history
of
the
statute
that
congress
determined
for
itself
that
the
benefits
of
stricter
regulations
would
in
fact
justify
their
costs.
instead
the
indication
is
that
congress
left
that
to
the
agency.
congress
took
a
very
careful
look
at
the
separate
issue
of
the
discharge
of
pollutants
and
legislated
numerous
very
specific
provisions
concerning
the
discharge
of
pollutants.
but
when
it
came
to
water
intake,
congress
gave
scant
attention
to
that
at
all
and
included
only
this
one
very
general
provision
in
the
act
on
that
subject.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
right.
in
our
view,
that
strongly
supports
our
view
that,
first,
congress
understood
that
consideration
of
cost
and
benefits
was
not
incompatible
with
the
application
of
a
best
technology
standard.
otherwise
it
would
not
have
required
that
consideration
as
part
of
the
best
quality
standard,
which
seems
to
show
at
a
minimum
that
a
best
technology
standard
does
not
unambiguously
foreclose
consideration
of
the
relationship
between
costs
and
benefits.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
two
points
on
that.
the
first
is
that
this
is
how
it's
always
been
done.
i
mean,
since
1977
at
least.
first,
permitting
decisions
have
always
been
done
on
a
facility-by-facility,
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
sure.
i
guess
now
i
have
three
points.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
the
first
is
that
--
the
first
is
that
the
history
here
is,
that
i
was
referring
to,
is
with
respect
to
cooling
water
intake
structures,
where
for
more
than
30
years.
cooling
water
intake
structures
have
been
determined
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
where
epa
determined
as
early
as
1977
and
ever
since
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
impose
--
to
require
the
use
of
technology
whose
costs
were
wholly
disproportionate
to
its
benefits.
so
this
is--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--yes.
and
i
mean,
just
the
phrasing
of
the
standard,
whether
costs
are
wholly
disproportionate
to
benefits,
itself
indicates
that
there
is
a
comparison
here.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
and
we
cite
in
our
brief
one
particular
--
in
our
reply
brief,
one
specific
example
where
benefits
were
clearly
not
de
minimis.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
first
off
--
i'm
sorry.
i
guess
one
basic
point
is
just
that
this
--
first
off
--
excuse
me.
in
terms
of
the
court
of
appeals'
recognition
that
costs
and
benefits
could
be
compared
in
extreme
circumstances,
that
just
deprives
it
of
the
logic
of
its
position,
because
when
we
talk
about
the
extent
or
degree
or
manner
to
which
a
permissible
consideration
can
be
considered,
that's
a
classic
matter
for
the
agency's
gap-filling
discretion.
it's
not
something
for
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
respondents
to
get
discretion
on.
and,
second,
in
terms
of
the
concern
that
cost-benefit
analysis
can
be
difficult
because
we're
comparing
benefits
that
are
not
easily
monetized
to
economic
costs,
that
is
just
systematically
the
case
with
all
cost-benefit
analyses,
even
ones
which
people
do
in
ordinary
life.
when
i
decide
whether
to
buy
a
tv
for
this
amount
or
a
more
expensive
tv
for
a
different
amount,
i
don't
know
exactly
how
in
my
head
i
quantify
that,
but
i
do.
and
with
respect
to
cost-benefit--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--not
--
well
--
but
with
costbenefit
analyses,
again,
this
is
--
this
is
routinely
done
by
agencies.
the
--
the
statisticians
and
the
economists--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no,
the
--
i
think
the
most
irrational
thing
would
be
to
just
throw
up
one's
hands
and
say
that
we
are
going
to
impose
standards
whether
or
not
they
do
more
harm
than
good,
whether
or
not
they
make
any
sense.
and
--
and
here,
i
mean,
the
agency
very
carefully
considered
the
relative
costs
and
the
relative
benefits,
and
also
did
so
in
a
way
that
puts
a
thumb
on
the
side
of
the
environmental
side
of
the
scales--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
these
words
have
different
meanings
in
different
contexts,
which
just
underscores
their
ambiguity.
but
taking
the
phrase
here
as
a
whole,
if
i
said
i
was
going
to
acquire
the
best
technology
available
for
winterizing
my
lawnmower
so
that
it
would
work
again
in
the
spring,
the
best
technology
available
for
winterizing
a
$400
lawnmower
would
not
be
$500
fluid,
because
when
one's
talking
about
protecting
something,
it's
--
it's
intuitive
to
think
about
the
value
of
what's
being
protected.
and
again,
congress
by
expressly
requiring
cost-benefit
analysis
for
some
of
the
pollution
discharge
limits
was
expressly
contemplating
exactly
what
seems
to
concern
you,
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--that
costs
would
be
traded
against
benefits.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
these
--
well,
all
of
these
words
can
have
different
meanings.
i
think
of
the
four
best
technology
provisions
that
are
expressly
cross-referenced
in
this
provision,
the
one
that's
most
informative
here
is
the
best
conventional
pollutant
control
technology,
because
congress
expressly
required
cost-benefit
consideration
in
determining
the
best
conventional
pollutant
control
technology.
and
"best"
is
the
only
word
in
that
phrase
that
is
amenable
to
a
cost-benefit
reading.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
to
be
clear,
the
agency
does
not
think
--
and
therefore
did
not
in
its
regulation
presume
--
that
the
best
technology
available
for
minimizing
adverse
environmental
impact
was
more
strict
than
the
other
standards.
and
just
two
commonsense
points
on
that.
the
pollutant
discharge
standards,
which
are
the
other
ones,
establish
their
goal
to
be
the
elimination
of
discharges,
whereas
here
this
provision
says
that
its
--
that
its
goal
is
to
minimize.
so
on
its
face,
this
is
a
more
measured
standard
than
the
others.
and,
second,
as
a
practical
matter,
there's
no
reason
congress
would
want
greater
protection
for
fish
through
intake
structures
than
for
people
through
the
discharge
of
pollutants.
i
mean
especially
--
congress
enacted
all
of
these
provisions
in
1972,
and
it
provided
at
that
time
that
in
determining
pollution
discharge,
even
including
toxic
pollution
discharge,
epa
was
required
to
consider
the
relationship
between
cost
and
benefits
up
until
1989.
and
it
makes
no
sense
to
think
that
congress
would
have
wanted
stricter
standards
for
fish
here
than
for
people
under
the
toxic
discharge
provisions.
and
on
its
face--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--yes.
our
argument
is
that--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--this
provision
here
for
water
intake--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--pardon?
mr.
daryl
joseffer
we
think
congress
did
not
intend
this
to
be
a
tougher
standard
than
the
ones
for
discharge
of
pollutants.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
because
these
are
all
different
standards.
one
thing
--
two
things
are
for
certain.
one
is
that
this
standard
is
different
from
all
of
the
others.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
right.
but
there's
no
reason
to
presume
this
one
is
more
rigorous,
especially
considering
--
first
--
i
mean,
the
words
here
--
it
uses
important
words
here
it
did
not
use
elsewhere.
here
we
have
"best
technology
available"
--
"best
technology
available
for
minimizing
adverse
environmental
impact.
"
and,
first,
"best",
as
some
of
the
examples
earlier
demonstrated,
is
not
necessarily
the
way
that
most
single-mindedly
pursues
a
goal
at
all
costs
and
without
regard
to
all
of
the
consequences,
which
is
why
--
for
example,
if
you
were
talking
about
the
best
way
to
get
home,
it
would
not
necessarily
be
the
most
direct
route
if
that
required
payment
of
a
toll.
similarly,
"minimize"
is
also
an
--
and,
again,
congress
used
"best"
to
mean
that
in
"best
conventional
pollutant
control
technology",
because
that
is
the
only
word
there
that
is
amenable
to
our
reading.
and,
second,
"minimize"
is
also
an
important
word,
because
"minimize"
has
two
perfectly
common
and
ordinary
meanings.
one
is
to
reduce
to
the
greatest
extended
possible.
the
other
in
ordinary
usage
is
to
reduce
to
some
lesser,
reasonable
level.
so
if
i
said,
for
example,
that
i
was
trying
to
minimize
the
risk
of
being
hit
by
a
car
today,
i
presumably
would
not
mean
that
i
was
staying
inside
at
home
all
the
time.
instead,
it
would
mean
that,
consistent
with
other
needs,
including
economic
ones,
like
the
need
to
travel
to
work--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--i
was
being
prudent.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
elsewhere
in
the
clean
--
in
the
clean
water
act,
congress
clearly
did
use
"minimize"
to
mean
reduction,
because
congress
called
for
a,
quote,
"drastic
minimization
of
paperwork".
that's
in
33
u.s.
code
1251(f).
and
a
"drastic
minimization"
has
to
mean
a
drastic
reduction,
which
is
a
perfectly
ordinary
meaning
of
the
--
of
the
word.
"available"
is
also
relevant
because,
justice
ginsburg,
as
you
mentioned
earlier--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no.
we
--
we
construe
--
i
think
the
other
side
might
take
that
view
of
--
of
"minimize".
our
view
is
that
"minimize"
means
you
have
to
reduce--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--a
reasonable
--
it
refers
to
a
reasonable
reduction.
and
so
some
minimal
reduction
in
this
context
would
probably
not
be
reasonable.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
i
guess--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no,
because
it
does
have
to
be
a
reasonable
reduction,
which
would
not
be
--
in
this
context
would
not
be
a
trivial
one.
reasonableness
--
we
may
--
we
may
agree,
depending
on
what
one
means
by
"reasonable".
"reasonableness"
tends
to
connote
a
consideration
of
--
of
all
relevant
factors.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
and
so
when
we're
talking
about
a
reasonable
reduction,
we
are
going
to
talk
about
a
reduction
that
is
reasonable
in
light
of,
among
other
things,
the
relationship
between
costs
and
benefits.
so
we
may
agree
if
that's
what
we
both
mean
by
"reasonable".
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i
think
that's
right
with
--
with
"reasonably"
entailing
a
consideration
of
--
of
the
relationship
between
costs
and
benefits.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
yes.
and
if
--
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
thank
you.
if
i
could
start
where
we
left
off,
the
fact
that
riverkeeper
i
in
their
view
is
wrong
i
think
does
confirm
what
anyone
would
conclude
after
reading
the
two
opinions,
which
is
that
they
are
not
consistent.
at
a
minimum
that
helps
to
demonstrate
ambiguity.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
our
--
our
--
what
we
said
is
we
thought
the
court
of
appeals
was
dead
wrong,
that
it
was
a
very
important
issue,
but
that
in
the
interlocutory
posture
of
this
case,
which
was
a
remand,
we
did
not
think
that
it
was
so
--
so
important
as
to
warrant
your
cert
standards.
frankly,
we
were
delighted
to
find
out
we
were
wrong
about
that.
[laughter]
the
other
point
i
need
to
make
is
that
this
case
is,
after
all,
about
the
one
sentence
in
the
act
that
deals
with
water
intake,
not
about
all
the
other
detailed
provisions
about
the
discharge
of
pollutants,
which
is
important
because
about
half
of
the
last
argument
dealt
with
the
discharge
of
pollutants.
the
fact
that
there's
no
list
of
factors
here,
and
instead
just
one
general
sentence,
just
underscores
that
on
this
issue,
congress
was
delegating
especially
broad
authority
to
the
agency
to
address
a
problem
that
at
the
time
was
relatively
novel
and
that
legislative
record
confirms
congress
itself
did
not
give
any
real
weight
to.
if
we
want
to
look
at
the
floor
statements,
though,
i
would
not
look
to
the
floor
statement
of
congressman
muskie
concerning
a
different
standard,
which
was
the
bat
standard,
but
instead
to
the
only
floor
statement
that
addresses
this
standard,
and
it
says
that
economic
practicability
is
the
test,
and
everyone
agrees
that
practicably
considers
costs
and
benefits.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
look
--
first
off.
what
epa
did
here
is
not
among
the
more
robust
forms
of
cost-benefit
analysis.
and,
therefore,
we
don't
think
the
court
necessarily
needs
to
expand
--
to
opine
on
the
outer
limits
here.
epa
did
two
things:
first,
as
you
mentioned,
first
it
created
nationwide
performance
standards;
second,
it
did
a
variance
when
an
individual
facility's
costs
are
significantly
greater
than
the
benefits.
so,
first,
in
determining
--
so
--
well,
the
second
of
those
is
easy
because
there
is
an
obvious
thumb
on
the
environmental
side
of
the
scales
there.
costs
have
been
to
be
significantly
greater
than
benefits,
which
is
not
all
that
aggressive.
here,
with
respect
to
the
nationwide
performance
standards,
epa
again
did
not
just
try
to
do
a
strict
--
are
costs,
you
know,
one
penny
greater
than
benefits.
instead
it
weighed
up
a
number
of
considerations.
it
looked
to
the
incremental
benefits
of
closed-cycle
cooling
versus
the
technologies
that
it
chose.
and
then
it
--
and
then
it
determined
that
those
incremental
benefits
were
outweighed
by
a
variety
of
other
things,
including,
one,
the
extremely
high
costs
of
closed-cycle
cooling,
three
and
a
half
billion;
second,
the
cost-benefit
ratio,
which
was
extremely
disproportionate;
third,
the
energy
impacts
which,
as
you
mentioned,
are
really
quite
significant.
we
are
talking
about
40
percent
of
the
nation's
power
supply.
and
if
we
are
going
to
reduce
that
by
4
percent
and
require
20
new
plants
to
be
built
and
require
each
of
those
plants
to
be
taken
offline
for
10
months
while
it's
retrofitted,
that's
really
a
very
significant
concern
of
epa's.
and
then
the
fourth
is
air
pollution.
and
so
when
epa
is
weighing
benefits
against
all
of
those
other
things
and
is
not
purporting
to
assign
artificial
monetary
values
to
everything,
i
argue
that
that
just
underscores
that
we
are
well
within
the
agency's
discretion
here.
if
i
could
also
turn
then
to
just
the
main
point.
one
of
the
main
points
here
is
that
i
really
don't
think
respondents
have
any
logic
to
their
position,
because
when
we
are
talking
about
the
text
they
say
costs
have
to
be
considered
against
affordability
and
not
against
benefits.
but
when
we
are
talking
about
absurd
results,
they
say,
oh
sure,
you
can
consider
costs
against
benefits,
when
it
would
otherwise
be
absurd.
but
under
chevron
it's
the
agency's
gap-filling
discretion
to
decide
where
to
draw
that
line,
and
nothing
draws
a
de
minimis
line
in
the
statute
any
more
than
the
line
epa
has
drawn.
