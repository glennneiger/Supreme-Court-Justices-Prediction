"reduce"
in
any
event
is
--
is
not
--
is
not
the
same
as
what
you
are
arguing.
you
are
arguing
reduce
to
the
maximum
extent
reasonably
possible.
the
word
"reduce"
alone
doesn't
convey
that.
the
word
"reduce"
would
just
mean,
you
know,
if
you
--
if
you
knock
it
down
any
amount,
you
have
reduced
it.
but
you
are
saying
"minimize"
requires
more
than
that.
it
means
reducing
it
to
the
maximum
extent
reasonably
possible.
isn't
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
to
reduce.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
your
position.
you
--
you
don't
think
that
"minimize"
even
means
that
you
reduce
it
to
the
maximum
extent
reasonably
possible?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
any
reduction
constitutes
minimizing?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
say
it
again,
and
you
tell
me
whether
you
agree.
i
had
thought
that
what
you
meant
the
meaning
of
"minimize"
was
is
that
you
reduce
the
--
the
harm
to
the
maximum
extent
reasonably
possible,
not
merely
that
you
reduce
it
to
some
extent.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
"reasonable"
includes
everything.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mahoney,
i
--
before
you
go
any
further.
i
am
not
clear.
i
--
i
did
not
understand
that
for
30
years
the
only
test
has
been
a
grossly
disproportionate
test.
you
seem
to
accept
that
as
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
wholly
disproportionate?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
--
you're
happy
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
you
think
they
can
use
a
wholly
disproportionate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you'd
be
happy
if
they
continued
to
do
that,
but
you
wouldn't
be
particularly
happy
if
we
prescribed
that
as
the
only
available
test?
is
that
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
--
except,
you
say,
when
it's
grossly
disproportionate?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
--
where
--
where
do
you
find
that
or
the
second
circuit
said,
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
using
the
word
in
a
strange
--
"economically
available"?
justice
antonin
scalia
economically
feasible
maybe.
but
you
wouldn't
say
"economically
available".
you
wouldn't
say,
i
can't
buy
the
house
because
for
me
it's
not
economically
available.
i
might
say
it's
not
economically
feasible,
it's
not
economically
possible,
but
it's
not
economically
available?
that's
weird.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
disagree
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
--
but
that
--
that
doesn't
answer,
it
seems
to
me,
the
question.
yes,
the
best
available
for
that
purpose,
but
what
is
best
for
that
purpose
could
include
other
factors
such
as
how
expensive
is
it
and
--
and
how
much
it
harms
the
industry
and
all
sorts
of
other
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why
--
why
does
it?
i
don't
know
how
you
draw
the
lines
you
are
drawing.
you
say
yes,
"best"
includes
whether
it
would
bankrupt
the
industry.
well,
if
it
includes
whether
it
would
bankrupt
the
industry,
why
shouldn't
it
include
whether
it
would
bankrupt
the
individual
power
company?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
agree
with
you
on
that,
whether
it's
borne
by
the
industry.
but
you
draw
the
line
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
where
that
line
is
drawn
up
to
the
agency?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
you
can't
get
a
variance
--
and
you
also
would
say
the
epa
cannot
take
it
into
account
--
if
this
particular
plant
--
although
the
company
as
a
whole
is
quite
prosperous,
this
is
a
small
plant,
and
it's
not
generating
that
much
electricity.
it's
really
just
not
worth
it
to
put
in
this
big
tower.
we
are
going
to
close
down.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
not
be
something
that
epa
could
take
into
account.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
has
--
it
has
required
--
not
just
permitted
but
required
cost-benefit
analysis
in
other
areas.
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
--
what
is
your
response
to
the
fact
that
it
seems
ridiculous
to
allow
it,
and
indeed
require
it
in
effluent
situations
where
human
health
is
at
stake,
and
yet
to
forbid
it
in
this
intake
situation
when
you're
just
talking
about
the
snail
darter.
what
--
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
did
that
section
307
not
allow
cost-benefit?
justice
antonin
scalia
these
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
petitioners
operate
large
power
plants.
to
cool
their
facilities,
they
employed
things
that
are
called
“cooling
water
intake
structures”
which
extract
water
from
nearby
waterways
and
thereby
pose
a
threat
to
aquatic
organisms.
these
cooling
structures
are
subject
to
regulation
under
the
clean
water
act
which
requires
that
they
“reflect
the
best
technology
available
for
minimizing
adverse
environmental
impact.”
at
issue
in
this
case
are
regulations
promulgated
pursuant
to
this
provision
so-called
“phase
ii”
rules
that
govern
existing
power
facilities
which
extract
a
certain
volume
of
water
for
cooling
purposes.
the
phase
ii
rules
adopted
by
epa
set
national
performance
standards
which
mandate
certain
percentage
reductions
in
impingement
which
is
squashing
of
the
aquatic
organism
and
entrainment
which
is
sucking
them
into
the
cooling
system.
the
epa
did
not
require
these
existing
power
plants
to
retrofit
their
facilities
with
so-called
“closed-cycle
cooling”
that
involves
taking
in
much
less
water
and
thereby
squashing
and
sucking
in
many
fewer
aquatic
organisms.
instead
of
requiring
that,
the
agency
set
the
national
standards
at
a
level
that
would
permit
use
of
technologies
that
in
its
view
approximated
the
benefits
of
closed-cycle
cooling
at
significantly
lower
costs.
the
phase
ii
rules
also
provide
for
variances
from
these
standards
for
facilities
that
can
demonstrate
that
the
costs
of
compliance
would
be
“significantly
greater
than
the
benefits
of
complying
with
the
applicable
performance
standards.”
the
respondents,
environmental
groups
in
various
states
challenged
these
phase
ii
rules
arguing
in
part
that
the
epa
impermissibly
relied
upon
cost-benefit
analysis
in
setting
the
national
performance
standards
and
in
providing
for
variances
from
those
standards.
the
second
circuit
agreed
and
granted
the
petition
for
review.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
in
promulgating
the
phase
ii
rules,
the
epa
relied
on
its
view
that
the
phrase
“best
technology
available
for
minimizing
adverse
environmental
impact”
the
standard
mandated
by
the
statute
permits
consideration
of
a
technology's
costs
and
of
the
relationship
between
those
costs
and
the
environmental
benefits
produced.
under
our
case
law,
that
determination
by
the
agency
is
entitled
to
deference
if
it
is
and
will
be
sustained
if
it
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
conclude
that
it
is.
the
phrase
“best
technology”
could
of
course
refer
to
the
technology
that
produces
the
most
of
some
good,
in
this
case,
environmental
improvement.
but
it
may
also
refer
to
the
technology
that
most
efficiently
produces
that
good
even
if
--
even
if
it
produces
a
lesser
quantity.
likewise,
the
phrase
“for
minimizing
adverse
environmental
impact”
does
not
necessarily
mandate
the
greatest
reduction
possible.
the
term
“minimizing”
admits
a
degree
and
its
use
suggest
that
the
agency
retains
discretion
to
determine
the
extent
of
reduction
warranted
under
the
circumstances
including
consideration
of
the
relative
costs
and
benefits
involved.
nor
does
the
structure
of
the
clean
water
act
preclude
the
epa's
interpretations.
the
act
mandates
a
series
of
best
technology
standards
governing
the
discharge
of
pollutants
into
the
nation's
waterways.
those
various
standards
are
in
turn
elucidated
by
varying
lists
of
statutory
factors.
for
some
of
the
standards,
the
epa
must
conduct
some
form
of
cost-benefit
analysis.
for
others,
it
is
instructed
to
consider
the
cost
of
achieving
the
effluent
reduction.
section
1326(b),
the
provision
at
issue
here
contains
no
such
list
of
factors.
respondents
argue
that
we
should
infer
from
that
silence
that
cost-benefit
analysis
is
forbidden.
we
decline
that
invitation.
first,
all
the
other
tests
authorize
some
form
of
cost
consideration.
if
silence
is
preclusive,
section
13
--
consideration
under
section
1326(b)
would
be
forbidden,
a
position
rejected
by
respondents
in
the
second
circuit.
secondly,
section
1326(b)
is
silent
not
only
would
respect
the
cost
considerations
but
also
with
respect
to
all
factors.
if
silence
is
preclusive,
the
epa
could
not
consider
any
factors
in
setting
rules
under
1326(b)
which
is
an
obvious
logical
impossibility.
ultimately,
even
respondents
in
the
second
circuit
concede
that
some
form
of
cost-benefit
analysis
is
permitted.
in
reviewing
a
prior
set
of
rules
under
1326(b),
the
second
circuit
founded
permissible
for
the
epa
to
reject
a
stricter
regulatory
standard
that
would
have
achieved
“a
relatively
small
improvement
at
a
very
significant
cost.”
and
in
the
decision
below,
the
second
circuit,
while
rejecting
cost-benefit
analysis
held
that
1326(b)
mandates
only
those
technologies
whose
costs
can
“reasonably
be
borne
by
the
industry.”
but
of
course
whether
it
is
reasonable
to
bear
a
particular
cost
depends
upon
the
resulting
benefits.
likewise,
respondents
concede
that
the
epa
need
not
require
industry
to
spend
billions
in
order
to
save
one
more
aquatic
organism.
this
concedes
the
principle
and
there
is
no
statutory
basis
for
limiting
the
comparison
of
cost
and
benefits
to
situations
where
the
benefits
are
de
minimis
rather
than
significantly
disproportionate
which
is
what
--
what
is
the
standard
that
epa
used
here.
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
epa
permissibly
relied
on
cost-benefit
analysis
in
setting
the
national
performance
standards
and
providing
for
cost-benefit
variances
from
those
standards.
we
express
no
views
regarding
the
remaining
basis
for
the
second
circuit's
decision
which
are
not
at
issue
today.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
cases
are
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justices
souter
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
