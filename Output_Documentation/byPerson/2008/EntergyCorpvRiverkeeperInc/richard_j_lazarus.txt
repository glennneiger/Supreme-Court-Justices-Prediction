mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
section
316(b),
congress
did
not
authorize
epa
to
decide
that
the
benefits
of
minimizing
adverse
environmental
impact
did
not
justify
the
cost
of
available
technology.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
let
me
explain
our
position,
your
honor.
epa
has
no
authority
in
any
circumstance
to
decide
that
fish
aren't
worth
a
certain
amount
of
cost.
so
epa
never
has
the
authority,
in
any
context,
to
weigh
costs
against
benefits.
the
reason
why
we
think
that
would
not
lead
to
the
kind
of
absurd
circumstances
they're
suggesting
is
not
because
congress
has
that
--
sorry
--
epa
has
that
authority.
it's
because
we
don't
think
that
those
kinds
of
absurd
circumstances
result
from
the
cost-benefit
balance
mandated
by
congress.
let
me
explain
why,
because
there
are
three
safeguards
in
the
statutory
language,
its
plain
meaning,
which
would
guard
against
any
possibility
that
a
regulated
facility
would
have
to
spend
millions
or
hundreds
of
millions
or
billions
of
dollars
to
protect
just
a
few
fish.
they
would
--
that
would
never
happen.
i
mean,
it
would
never
happen,
but
not
because
epa
can
decide
it's
not
worth
it.
this
is
why
it
would
never
happen:
three
reasons,
and
these
are
contributing
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
if
you
actually
had
some
exorbitant,
huge
increase
in
costs,
if
that
would
happen,
most
of
those
cases
would
be
triggered
by
the
availability
requirement,
and
that
is
that
epa
could
deem
that
cost
not
to
be
reasonably
borne
by
the
industry.
that's
the
ground
they--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
fits
quite
well
in
the
word
"available".
and
epa
has
said
that
since
1976.
it
was
not
disputed
by
anyone
that
available--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--i
think
because
it's
clear
that
in
the
context
of
the
clean
water
act
what
congress
meant
in
"available"
--
and
this
is
throughout
the
statute
--
all
the
technology-based
performance
standards,
the
availability
was
both
technologically
available
and
economically
available.
and
that's
just
not--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it
may
--
it
may
be
weird,
your
honor,
but
it
is
not
anything
that
has
ever
been
disputed
in
the
interpretation
of
the
water
act.
it's
how
epa
has
interpreted
it
for
30
years,
and
no
court,
no
one,
has
ever
disputed
the
fact
that
availability
includes
economic
availability.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
because
what
the
statute
says
is
not
that
epa
should
--
should
promulgate
the
best
technology.
it
says
"the
best
technology
available
for
minimizing.
"
and
what
--
what
congress
did
was
told
epa
what
the
technology
must
be
best
for.
and
that's
not
reducing
it
to
the
amount
that
epa
believes
is
sensible.
it
means
minimizing
it,
which
means
reducing
to--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
it
certainly
--
it
certainly
includes
costs.
it
certainly
includes
sort
of
whether
it
can
be
reasonably
borne
by
the
industry.
there's--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
question,
your
honor,
that
the
word
"available",
and
perhaps
the
word
"best"
--
we
think
the
word
"available"
includes
an
inquiry
into
whether
or
not
it
could
be
borne
by
industry.
we
also
wouldn't
doubt,
your
honor
--
we
wouldn't
doubt--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
no--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--we're
not,
your
honor,
and
let
me
try
to
explain
because
i
think
we
are
confusing
different
inquiries
here.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
we
also
would
agree
that
epa
can
take
into
account
site-specific
factors
in
deciding
whether
technology
is
available.
some
technology
may
be
available
for
some
facilities
given
their
location,
but
not
available
for
other
facilities
given
their
location;
but
when
--
where
epa
decides,
right,
where
epa
decides
whether
technology
is
available
or
not,
we
don't
doubt
they
have
authority
to
do
that
and
some
discretion
to
decide
when
technology
is
no
longer
available
because
of
the
cost.
but
where
they
don't
have--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--right.
and
that
is
perfectly
appropriate.
but
here's
what
they
did
which
is
not
permitted:
they
can
decide
based
on
site-specific
factors
whether
technology
is
available.
what
they
can't
do
is,
once
they
decide
a
technology
is
available,
they
can't
then
say:
but
we
don't
think
it's
worth
minimizing
adverse
environmental
impact
with
that
technology,
because
we
don't
think
those
benefits
are
worth
that
cost.
that
comparison
inquiry
they
can't
make.
so
if
i
can
do
my
safeguards:
the
first
one
is
we
think
availability
and
cost
would
eliminate
a
lot
of
those
problems.
but
let's
assume
--
let's
just
assume
the
technology
is
much
more
expensive,
way
more
expensive,
but
it's
still
available
in
our
view.
it
still
can
be
borne
by
the
industry
even
on
a
site-specific
basis,
which
we
don't
disagree
that
could
be
done.
then
let's
say
that
the
national
--
epa
says,
well,
but
that
will
only
save
--
you
know,
your
cheaper
technology
will
only
save
a
million
fish.
we
actually
think
you
have
to
save
a
million
and
one
fish.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--but--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--but
for
best
available
there
is
no
cost-benefit
analysis.
it's
only
for
best
practical--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--right.
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
but
--
well,
let
me
try
to
give
you
an
answer.
they
can
consider
costs
only
in
a
cost
feasibility
perspective.
they
cannot
compare
costs
to
benefits.
congress
made--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
i
don't,
because
it's
two
fundamentally
different
policy
decisions.
what
congress
decided
in
1972
was
that
epa
should
be
allowed
to
consider
costs
in
determining
whether
technology
was
available,
but
not
--
and
they
did
this
for
a
reason,
your
honor
--
but
not
to
weigh
those
costs
against
those
benefits
in
deciding
whether
or
not
those
costs
were
worth
it.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it
--
it
--
it's
still
feasible
for,
in
terms
of
the
--
whether
they
can
afford
it.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
you
--
you're
never
going
to
--
you're
never
going
reach
the
insane
result.
it's
never
going
to
happen,
your
honor.
it's
never
going
to
happen.
put
aside
the
availability
limitation,
which
will
cut
off
like
it
did
dry
cooling.
epa
rejected
it
saying
it
was
too
expensive.
not
because
of
the
cost-benefit:
it's
too
expensive.
if
you
actually
have
something
where
one
would
just
be
saving
a
few
fish,
what
you
have
to
remember
is
that
316(b)
doesn't
impose
technology
design
requirements.
what
it
imposes
is
technology-based
performance
standards.
and
if
epa
were
to
say,
you
have
to
save
just
a
few
more
fish,
if
they
really
want
to
promulgate
a
standard
on
that
kind
of
increment,
the
regulated
facility
would
always
be
able
to
save
just
a
small
increment,
without
adopting
some
expensive
technology,
because
of
the
way
cooling
water
intake
structures
work.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
i
think
it's
not
ambiguous
language
because
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
language,
it
says,
right,
in
section
316(b),
epa
is
required,
right
--
instructed,
required
--
that
location,
design,
construction,
capacity
of
cooling
water
intake
structures
reflect
the
best
technology
available
for
minimizing
adverse
environmental
impact.
and
what
we
argue
--
and
i
think
this
is
quite
compelling,
your
honor
--
is
that
with
that
language
congress
itself
struck
the
cost-benefit
balance.
congress
said
for
costs,
epa
has
to
ensure
the
technology
be
available
either
on
industry
wide,
and
it
can
take
site
into
account
site-specific
factors.
for
benefits,
congress
said,
epa,
you
have
to
ensure
that
the
environmental
benefits
--
the
adverse
environmental
impact
--
be
minimized
to
the
extent
that
can
be
done
with
available
technology.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
but--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
your
honor,
this
is
a--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
it's
a
--
it's
a
complete
line.
whether
the
word
"available"
can
extend
to
cost
feasibility
analysis
is
one
question.
whether
the
word
epa
to
compare
costs
and
benefits,
to
weigh
one
against
the
other,
that's
a
completely
different
question.
so
the
fact
that
we
say
the
first
half,
it
doesn't
mean
the
second.
congress
really
had
a
--
what
they
were
doing
in
1972,
was
congress
was--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no.
it's
--
it's
they
can't
make
the
judgment
that
it's
not
worth
it.
it's--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--and
for
reasons
that
you
suggested--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--absolutely.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
absolutely.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
what
--
in
1972,
this
is
what
congress
was
faced
with.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
if
it
can
be
reasonably
borne
by
the
industry
or
some
site-specific,
they
can't
make
any
other
judgment.
and
if
i
can,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--right.
i
think
because
such
an
effect
wouldn't
happen.
what
senator
muskie
and
congress
was
worried
about
in
1972,
your
honor,
was
they
were
worried
about
the
possible
underregulation.
they
worried
about
overregulation.
and
their
concern
was,
if
you
gave
epa
the
authority
to
weigh
costs
against
benefits,
you
would
have
systemic
underregulation
and
the
regulatory
process
bogged
down
by--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--and
going
back
to
justice
souter's
statement
a
moment
ago,
which
i
agree
with,
what
senator
muskie
--
the
distinction
he
wanted
to
draw
was
to
allow
epa
to
engage
in
cost
analysis
as
to
feasibility,
money
in
the
bank,
but
not
to
make
that
value
judgment
of
what's
worth
what.
and--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--it
certainly
does
depend,
and
this
is
how
epa
does
it,
not
just
in
this
area
but
throughout
all
the
technology-based
performance
standards,
looking
at
availability.
epa
looks
at
industry
revenues,
barriers
to
entry,
and
decides
whether
or
not
this
technology
is
available.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it's
quite
possible--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--but
notice
--
notice
--
not
economically.
notice
in
this
case,
what
the
second
circuit
said
in
remanding
was
epa
might
well
be
able
to
justify
the
same
decision
it
made
on
an
availability
basis,
but
they
didn't
make
that
determination
here.
what's
happened
for
the
past
30
years,
which
is
how
counsel
over
here
posited
the
case
--
what's
happened
over
the
last
30
years
is
the
epa
has
ignored
the
statutory
language
and
has
engaged
in
this
wholly
disproportionate
analysis
as
a
result,
which
has
led
to
the
very
kind
of
underregulation
that
senator
muskie
was
worried
about,
and
that
is
that
they
have
never
looked
to
see
whether
closed-cycle
cooling
is
in
fact
available,
economically
available.
instead,
they've
tried
to
compare
these
things.
they've
just
kept
on
going
with
once-through
cycle
cooling.
they've
never
given
a
serious
look
at
closed-cycle
cooling.
and
the
kind
of
increment
we're
talking
about,
if
they
actually
looked
at
closed-cycle
cooling,
if
they'd
make
an
availability
determination,
we
are
not
talking
about
increments;
it's
a
98
percent
reduction
in
the
water
flow
that
happens
if
you
go
from--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--once-through
to
closed-cycle.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
if
it
bankrupts
three
firms
--
if
one
looks
how
epa
has
interpreted
that
historically,
your
honor,
throughout
all
the
pollution
control
statutes,
the
air
act,
the
water
act,
resource
conservation
act,
epa
has
said
that
itself
isn't
enough
to
say
it's
not
available
for
the
industry,
but
it
is
possible
--
we
don't
doubt
this
--
it
is
possible--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
but
here's
what
happens:
what
the
epa
said
--
and
you
can
see
this
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
crushed
stone
case,
where
the
court
drew
this
distinction.
a
particular
facility
can
seek
a
variance
based
on
cost
impact
to
them,
if
they
can
show
that
the
cost
to
them
is
much
greater
because
of
some
particular
circumstances
to
them
than
it
is
for
the
industry
as
a
whole.
this
court
said
they
could
do
that.
epa
has
long
said
it.
we
don't
question
it,
that
they
can
do
a
cost--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no.
and
that's
the
very
distinction
this
court
drew
in
the
crushed
stone
case.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it's
--
the
way
this
court
interpreted
sort
of
the
use
of
categorical
standards
in
the
dupont
case,
early
on
in
the
1970s,
the
court
said
in
that
case
that
epa
can
promulgate
these
kind
of
technology-based
performance
standards
on
a
categorical
basis--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--but
if
they
do
so,
they
have
to
take
--
they
have
to
give
a
variance
possibility
because
if
a
particular--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--because
you
can't
do
it
on
a
cost-benefit
--
it's
not
a
cost-benefit
variance.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
that's
not
the
justification
for
the
cost
variance.
the
justification
for
cost
variance
is
not
because
of
sort
of
benefits
being
lost.
it's
because
if
you
can
show
--
this
is
the
only
basis
you
can
get
a
cost
variance,
and
this
is
an
important
distinction
but
not
an
easy
one.
the
only
way
you
can
get
a
variance
is
if
you
can
show
that
the
assumptions
epa
made
about
how
much
this
would
cost
don't
apply
to
you
because
there
is
something
different
about
your
facility,
so
it
actually
costs
you
much
more.
you
can
get
a
variance
for
that.
you
can't
get
a
variance
because
you
say,
"we
are
a
weak
company
and
our
revenues
aren't
strong.
"
you
can't
get
a
variance
for
that.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
that--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--the
epa
can
take
into
account,
as
they
do
for
all
technology-based
performance
standards
--
they
can
take
into
account
the
size
of
the
facility
to
the
extent
it
bears
on
the
availability
question.
they
can't
do
it
because
they
think
it's
not
worth
it
in
terms
of
the
benefits
over
here.
they
can
--
they
can
take
into
account
on
availability,
but
not
over
here.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
we're
not
saying
they
can't
take
that
into
account.
epa
has
said
they
can.
the
second
circuit
said
they
could,
and
we
agree.
but
here's
how
they
can
take
it
into
account.
they
can
take
it
into
account
in
deciding
what
will
be
necessary
to
minimize
adverse
environmental
impact.
so
they
can
take
into
account
those
things
that
in
decided
whether
or
not--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well
--
but
they
--
here's
what
they
can
do,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
anomalous
about
this:
the
epa
can
say,
"here
are
the
factors
we're
going
to
take
into
account
in
deciding
whether
or
not
we
are
minimizing
adverse
environmental
impact,
and
we
have
some
authority
to
decide
what
is
and
is
not
a
relevant
environmental
impact.
"
"we
--
here
are
the
things
we're
going
to
take
into
account
in
deciding
whether
or
not
this
technology,
this
cost,
makes
it
available
or
not.
"
they
have
some
authority
here,
but
once
they
decide
whether
technology
is
available,
once
they
decide
what
"environmental
impact"
means
and
what
it
means
to
minimize,
once
they
decide
that,
they
can't
then
say,
"well,
we
don't
think
these
impacts
are
worth
those
costs.
"
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
we
are
doing
the
exact
opposite,
your
honor.
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
say
that
the
information
that
epa
has
to
focus
on,
the
way
congress
constrained
them,
is
limited
and
it
doesn't
allow
them
to
weigh
one
against
the
other.
what
happens
if
--
and
this
is
why
congress
didn't
want
to
give
epa
cost-benefit
analysis
authority
here
or
almost
anywhere
in
the
statute.
congress
was
concerned
that
it
would
bog
down
the
regulatory
process,
and
that
is
that
if
you
actually
had
epa
--
had
to
come
up
to
this
weighing
of
one
to
the
other
and
try
to
weigh
these
imponderables,
you
would
be
subject
to
such
extraordinary
attack
--
it
happened
in
this
case
with
this
rulemaking
--
that
it
would
slow
down
the
decisionmaking
process.
it
wouldn't
speed
it
up.
congress
understood
that
information
is
not
costless.
and
sometimes
one
can
achieve
a
better
cost-benefit
balance
by
having
regulation
be
based
on
less
information
rather
than
more
information.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
and
that's
why
they
said,
we
want
to
take
out
this
particular.
remember,
before
1972,
there
was
cost-benefit
analysis
based
upon
assessment
of
water
quality
impacts.
and
congress
saw
what
happened
with
that.
it
completely
paralyzed
the
regulatory
decisionmaking
process.
they
ended
up
with
very
little
regulation.
so
they
said:
all
right,
we're
not
--
we
think
epa
can
do
cost-feasibility
analysis
well.
we
don't
think
they
do
cost-benefit
analysis
well.
we
think
that
kind
of
information
is
several
orders
of
magnitude
greater
and
more
imponderable,
and
it's--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--i
think
that
may
be
part,
but
i
don't
think
that's--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--the
real
reason
in
1972.
i
think
that
does
happen.
i
think
the
real
reason
in
1972
was
that
congress
saw
what
happened
before,
and
they
said,
it
turns
out
to
be
really
hard
in
the
water
quality
context
to
measure
and
value
environmental
impact.
it's
so
hard
that
we
think
that
epa
can
get
a
better,
more
rational
result
if
we
instead
say,
here's
what
you
focus
on,
technology
available,
minimizing,
and
don't
try
to
compare.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
i
think
our
argument
boils
down
to
that
they
can
focus
on
environmental
impacts,
define
what
is
and
isn't
an
environmental
impact,
they
can
focus
on
availability,
decides
what
costs
are
relevant
to
that,
and
when
a
technology
is
available--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
the
relevant--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--it
may
well
be
one
reason
why
congress
didn't
want
to
compare
one
to
the
other,
about
that
charged
atmosphere.
but
what
--
they
can't
do
it.
i
don't
think
they
are
doing
it
sub
rosa.
our
point
is,
your
honor,
that
they
do
it
according
to
congress's
instruction,
you
won't
have
these
kinds
of
absurd
results.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
sorry,
i
couldn't
quite
hear
you.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
i'm
--
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
a
specific
page.
i'm
going
to
give
you
the
statutory
language
of
section
316(b).
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
what
congress
is
doing
systemically
in
316(b)
and
throughout
the
clean
water
act
was
that
congress
was
saying
we
want
to
give
epa
the
authority
for
cost
feasibility;
we
don't
believe
in
this
--
that
it
works
with
cost-benefit
analysis
because
of
the
weighing
against
one
against
the
other.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--two
responses,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
in
1972,
which
is
when
316(b)
was
enacted,
congress
did
not
allow
cost-benefit
analysis
for
toxic
pollutants.
toxic
pollutants
were
not
regulated
under
section
301
and
304
of
the
statute.
they
were
not
subject
to
best
practicable
technology;
they
were
not
subject
to
best
available
technologies.
they
were
subject
to
a
separate
provision,
and
that
was
section
307
at
that
time.
that's
a
subsequent
amendment
to
the
law.
where
congress
originally--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--it
did
not
allow
cost-benefit.
what
--
the
way
congress
originally
approached
hazardous
water
pollutants
and
toxic
air
pollutants,
the
clean
air
act,
was
the
same.
they
said
epa,
this
is
so
harmful
that
we
actually
want
you
to
do
an
assessment
to
figure
out
at
what
level
will
it
no
longer
be
harmful
to
humans?
and
what
they
found
out
when
they
tried
that,
is
they
found
out,
boy,
that
information
is
unbelievably
hard
to
come
up
with.
and
so,
they
had
--
the
regulation
depended
on
this
incredible
information,
and
the
result
was
that
epa
did
nothing.
they
did
nothing
for
water
toxics,
they
did
nothing
for
air
toxics.
so
in
1977,
when
they
learned
how
more
information
basically
could
lead
to
less
regulation,
they
said
all
right:
we've
got
to
change
that.
that
doesn't
work,
so
we
are
going
to
move
to
a
technology-based
performance
approach
in
the
first
instance,
and
then
couple
it
with
--
still
keeping
the
health
base
as
a
backup,
to
be
able
to
go
past
that.
so
they
put
the
technology
base
as
a
first
step
and
they
kept
the
307,
but
in
1972,
your
honor,
there
was
only
one
provision
of
the
clean
water
act
in
which
congress
delegated
any
authority
to
epa
to
compare
costs
and
benefits;
and
that
was
under
301(b)(2)
and
304(b)(2).
and
in
that
provision
they
said
until
1977
only,
epa,
for
best
practical
control
technology,
you
can
and
you
must
do
cost-benefit
analysis.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
but
that's
the
only
provision.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
they
certainly
didn't
overrule
it
for
two
different
reasons.
if
you
look
at
the
riverkeeper
ii
opinion
--
i
think
it's
on
25a,
note
11
--
they
explain
that
in
riverkeeper
i,
dry
cooling
was
rejected
because
it
was
too
expensive.
that's
an
availability
consideration,
not
a
cost-benefit
consideration.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
he
gave
--
he
gave
several
reasons,
your
honor.
also
included
was
the
fact
that
it
was
too
expensive.
which
is
why
the
riverkeeper
ii
court
characterized
that
as
dictum.
in
all
events,
with
all
due
respect
to
my
former
colleague
on
the
georgetown
faculty,
judge
katzmann
was
wrong.
[laughter]
