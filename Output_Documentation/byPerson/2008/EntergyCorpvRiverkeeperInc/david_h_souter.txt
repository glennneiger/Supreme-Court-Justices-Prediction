justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
to
follow
up
on
that,
because
your
statement
about
compatibility
raises
what
for
me
is
a
fundamental
difficulty
in
understanding
this
case.
and
i
think
my
difficulty
goes
both
to
chevron
step
one
and
step
two.
and
that
is
this:
i
think
we
all
start
from
the
premise
that,
whatever
else
subsection
(b)
had
in
mind,
it
was
imposing
some
kind
of
a
technology-driven
standard
criterion.
it's
there
in
the
words.
the
difficulty
that
i
have
is
if
you
are
going
to
apply
on
at
least
a
site-specific
basis
a
cost-benefit
analysis,
i'm
not
sure
how
it
would
work.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you're
talking
about
the
--
the
possible
harm
from
pulling
in
a
few
fish
or
a
few
plankton
or
a
few
baby
clam
larvae
and
so
on,
as
against
the
cost
conceivably
of
millions
of
dollars
for
extending
intake
pipes
or
putting
technical
--
expensive
filtering
mechanisms,
you
are
dealing
with
such
incommensurables
that
i
don't
know
how
on
a
site
specific
basis
you
would
sensibly
apply
a
cost-benefit
analysis.
are
a
thousand
plankton
worth
a
million
dollars?
i
don't
know.
and
my
difficulty
then
is,
i
don't
know
how
it
would
work.
and
because
i
don't
know
how
it
would
work,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
are
going
to
apply
a
cost-benefit
analysis,
the
odds
are
what
you
are
going
to
do
is
basically
eliminate
the
whole
technology-driven
point
of
the
statute.
so
that's
my
difficulty.
can
you
help
me
out
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we
know
so
far
as
intake
pipes
are
concerned?
i
mean,
maybe
i
am
being
foolish
in
thinking
it's
a
little
easy
to
make
sense
of
it
when
we're
talking
about
toxic
discharges,
but
leaving
that
aside,
do
we
know
that,
with
respect
to
these
kind
of
intake
technology
decisions,
that
the
cost-benefit
analysis
has
been
in
any
way
sensible?
in
other
words,
maybe
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
this
just
doesn't
work
doing
it
on
a
site-specific
cost-benefit
analysis,
and
that's
why
we're
going
to
pass
subsection
(b)
in
the
first
place.
so
you
say,
well,
we've
had
experience
with
cost-benefit
analysis.
what's
the
experience?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
and
have
these
been
applications
of
something
more
than
the
outside
standard,
which
i
guess
everybody
agrees
would
apply
in
a
case
like
this,
that
when
it
just
becomes
wholly
or
outrageously
disproportionate,
there
wouldn't
be
--
that
there
would
in
that
sense
be
a
cost-benefit
cutoff?
these
have
been
more
subtle
decisions
than
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
easier
to
quantity
that
than
the
value
of
a
plankton?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
is
--
let
me
--
i
will
--
i
will
grant
you
that
agencies
purport
to
do
this
kind
of
thing.
but
my
question
and
i
think
justice
ginsburg's
question
is,
does
it
make
any
sense
in
these
circumstances
to
think
that
you
really
can
do
a
cost-benefit
analysis?
and
if
the
answer
is
no
--
we
have
been
purporting
to
do
it
but
it
really
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense
--
then
it
either
means
that
there
is
just
going
to
be
an
irrational
process
going
on,
or
it
means
that
the
technology-driven
standard
basically
is
going
to
be
read
right
out
of
the
statute,
because
you
are
always
going
to
find
some
disproportion
which
is
--
which
is
going
to
limit
your
use
of
technology.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
didn't
they
use
the
word
"cost"?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
your
argument
is
they
used
"cost"
here,
they
used
"cost"
there,
they
didn't
use
"cost"
here,
but
they
must
have
meant
"cost".
justice
david
h.
souter
and
maybe
the
inference
to
be
drawn
is
the
agency
is
not
supposed
to
be
taking
any
of
these
considerations
into
account.
justice
david
h.
souter
you've
got
the
--
i
mean
everybody
agrees
that
there
is
kind
of
an
ultimate
irrationality
standard
here.
so
that's
--
that's
not
--
that
--
that
kind
of
a
horrible
is
not
really
to
the
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
"availability"
--
if
"availability"
includes
economic
availability,
why
doesn't
"best"
include
"economically
best"?
justice
david
h.
souter
our
problem
is
that
we
--
you've
got
a
clear
distinction
in
mind,
and
i
don't
think
we
are
getting
the
distinction.
is
the
distinction
in
crude
terms
this:
they
can
consider
costs
in
the
sense
that
on
an
industry-wide
basis
they
can
ask,
is
there
money
in
the
bank
or
will
there
be
money
in
the
bank
to
pay
for
this?
they
don't
ask
cost-benefit
in
the
sense
of
asking:
is
the
money
in
the
bank
worth
what
they
are
going
to
get
for
it?
so
is
--
is
the
line
you
are
drawing
a
money
in
the
bank
line?
is
that
the
point
you
are
making?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
the
only
question
--
when
you
say
they
can
consider
costs,
are
you
saying
they
are
simply
asking
whether
it
is
economically
possible
for
the
industry
to
afford
this,
regardless
of
whether
it's
any
good
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
your
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
the
variance
a
matter
of
statutory
right
or
--
or
is
it
available
under
a
regulation?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
--
why
isn't
that
simply
another
name
for
cost-benefit
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
are
doing
it
on
cost-benefit.
you
are
saying--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
we
require
this
and
the
company
goes
bankrupt,
the
value
of
demanding
it
is
not
satisfied
by
the
result.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
the
reason
they
don't
do
cost-benefit
analysis
well
because
they
are
forced
to
do
it
in
a
political
atmosphere
in
which
it
is
difficult
to
make
rational
decisions?
is
that
basically
the
reason
congress
would
have
come
to
that
conclusion?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
i
think
--
i
see
your
point,
but
i
think
if
i
accept
your
point,
all
i
am
doing
is
saying,
they
may
in
a
kind
of
smoke
and
mirrors
way
take
cost-benefit
analysis
into
consideration
sub
rosa,
when
they
decide
what
availability
is
going
to
mean;
and
they
make
take
it
into
consideration
when
they
decide
what
a
--
a
--
an
undesirable
environmental
impact
is;
and
that
sort
of
gets
the
--
the
weighing
process
out
of
the
public
focus.
and
if
they
do
it
that
way,
they
--
they
can
bring
in
just
the
considerations
that
justice
breyer
is
talking
about,
but
they
don't
do
it
in
an
obvious
way.
and
i
think
that's
what
your
argument
boils
down
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
costs
are
relevant
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
when
they
made
that
decision,
are
they
not
in
effect
anticipating
the
kind
of
decision
that
they
would
make
on
a
more
specific
basis
in
a
more
highly
charged
political
atmosphere,
if
they
engaged
in
the
cost-benefit
analysis
that
you
say
they
can't
do?
