mr.
anthony
yang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
association-in-fact
enterprise
need
not
have
an
ascertainable
structure
distinct
from
the
predicate
acts
of
racketeering
committed
by
one
of
its
associates,
whatever
that
means.
rico's
statutory
text,
its
surrounding
context,
and
this
court's
construction
of
the
statute
show
that
rico's
definition
of
"enterprise"
is
broad
and
contains
no
such
limitation.
petitioner's
primary
argument,
that
the
term
"enterprise"
is
rendered
superfluous
and
merges
with
the
charged
pattern
of
racketeering
acts,
is
wrong
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first,
it's
wrong
as
a
formal
matter.
the
enterprise
is
a
group
of
individuals.
the
pattern
is
a
series
of
acts.
second,
it
fails
to
account
for
the
fact
that
the
relevant
pattern
of--
mr.
anthony
yang
--that
goes
to
my
second
reason.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
let
me
--
let
me
go
to
--
which
i
think
it
addresses
the
second
reason.
it's
distinct
as
a
formal
matter,
which
is
that
you
to
have
find
a
group
of
individuals
versus
a
series
of
acts.
you
can
infer
the
group
from
their
actions,
just
as
can
you
infer,
you
know,
a
relationship
between
individuals
by
the
way
they
act
together.
but
--
so
my
first
point
is
a
formal
one.
the
second
point
goes
straight
to
the
statute,
that
the
relevant
pattern
of
racketeering
acts
that
is
at
issue
in
rico
--
this
is
1962(c)
--
is
a
pattern
of
acts
committed
by
an
individual
defendant,
not
a
group.
in
fact,
in
h.j.
this
court
explained
that
the
premise
that
the
pattern
has
to
be
performed
by
a
group
or
an
association
--
this
is
at
page
244
of
the
court's
opinion
there
--
was
wrong
and
that
the
pattern
can
be
fully
the
work
of
an
individual
acting
alone.
it's
also
wrong
because
an
enterprise
remains
wholly
distinct
and
pertinent
in
numerous
rico
contexts
under
the
government's
interpretation.
mr.
anthony
yang
that's
correct.
mr.
anthony
yang
an
individual
can
be
an
enterprise
as
a
sole
proprietorship,
if
that's
the
question.
mr.
anthony
yang
that's
correct.
i
--
i
think
there
may
be
some
miscommunication
on
my
part.
i
would
direct
the
court
to
page
5a
of
the
appendix
which
reproduces
section
1962(c).
it
states,
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
--
it
doesn't
say
group,
enterprise
or
--
or
an
association
--
that
is
employed
or
associated
with
any
enterprise--
mr.
anthony
yang
--excuse
me.
the
--
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
anthony
yang
the
government
gray
brief.
so
what's
relevant
for
purposes
of
showing
an
element
of
a
1962(c)
violation
is
that
the
defendant
alone,
perhaps
with
others
--
but
the
element
is
the
defendant
has
to
commit
a
pattern
of
racketeering.
there
are
other
elements.
for
instance,
the
defendant
has
to
do
so
in
a
manner
that
participates
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
the
enterprise.
but,
of
course,
that
embraces
a
wholly
distinct
concept,
that
is,
the
enterprise.
now,
in
many
cases,
as
you
have
here,
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
of
this
defendant
is
proved
by
evidence
that
that
defendant
was
also
working
in
concert
with
others.
and
so
in
that
case,
the
pattern
element,
which,
again,
is
the
individual's
pattern
of
acts,
is
proved
by
the
same
type
of
evidence
that
would
prove
the
enterprise.
mr.
anthony
yang
we
don't
say
that
it's
not
a
separate
element,
and
we
also
don't
say
that
a
pattern
necessarily--
mr.
anthony
yang
--no,
i
--
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
what
we
--
we
said
is
that
the
evidence
regarding
the
pattern
of
activity
allows
the
jury
to
infer
the
existence
of
an
enterprise
because
an
enterprise--
mr.
anthony
yang
--no,
they
do.
in
fact
the
jury
can--
mr.
anthony
yang
--the
instruction
is
the
pertaining
to
an
ascertainable
structure
distinct
from
the
pattern
of
racketeering.
here,
you
still
have
to
show
an
enterprise,
and
the
--
the
jury
may
not
infer
an
enterprise
from
a
pattern,
but
certainly
it's
open
to
the
jury.
when
that
pattern
--
again,
the
pattern
is
an
individual's
conduct.
but
when
that
pattern
is
shown
through
evidence
that
that
individual
is
acting
with
others
over
a
long
period
of
time
to
either
--
to
establish
that
it's
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
if
that
same
evidence
not
only
shows
that
the
individual
committed
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
but
it
was
done
in
concert
with
others
and
that
the
--
that
evidence
shows
that
a
group
of
individuals
had
associated
in
fact
for
the
common
purpose
of
engaging
in
a
course
of
conduct.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
i
think
that's
the
case
that
we
gave
--
an
example
that
we
gave
in
our
brief,
which
is,
say,
an
individual
commits
a
very
long
string
of
bank
burglaries
and
--
actually,
make
it
robberies.
robbery
is
a
predicate
act;
burglary
is
not.
bank
burglaries
with
individuals,
but
each
time
he
does
it,
it's
with
a
different
group
of
individuals.
there
you
--
the
individual
would
be
established
--
you
could
establish
a
pattern
from,
say,
the
--
the
relatedness
of
the
crimes
through
an
m.o.
or
a
--
and
the
long
continuous
string
of
crimes,
more
than
a
few
months,
perhaps
years.
but
it
would
not
establish
an
enterprise.
mr.
anthony
yang
because
there
would
be
--
you
would--
mr.
anthony
yang
--what
would
show
is
that
the
individual
is
not
working
in
concert
with
others
to
achieve
an
end
because
there's
no
--
no
parallel
identity
between
any
two
of
the
crimes
except
for
the
individual
acting
alone.
mr.
anthony
yang
one
--
he
could
be--
mr.
anthony
yang
--he
could
be
an
enterprise
but
not
one
--
when
an
individual
acts
alone
as
an
enterprise,
the
individual
is
not
liable
for
racketeering
acts
under
1962(c)
under
this
court's
decision
in
cedric
kushner,
because
there's
a
requirement
in
1962(c)
that
the
individual
has
to
be
employed
by
or
associated
with
the
enterprise.
and
this
court
has
explained
that
you
have
to
have
some
distinctiveness
between
the
enterprise
itself
and
the
individual.
so
with
respect
to
the
individual,
there
would
be
no
--
he
might
be
an
enterprise.
it's
conceivable
that
he
could
be
deemed
an
enterprise,
but
not
one
that
has
any
relevance
for
rico
purposes
under
1962(c).
mr.
anthony
yang
i
guess
it's
--
it's
unlikely
that
the
government,
if
that
were
the
only
facts,
could
show
an
enterprise.
if
there
was
some
additional
evidence
that
the
individuals
had
gotten
together
and
said,
yes,
you
know
what,
call
me,
let's
work
together,
when
i'm
available
call
me,
but
it
just
happens
to
be
that
he's
never
called
me
twice.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
what's
--
what's
required
under
this
court's
decision
in
turkette,
which
we
think
flows
directly
from
the
language,
any
group
of
individuals
associated
in
fact,
is
that
the
group
of
persons
must
be
associated
together
for
a
common
purpose
of
engaging
in
a
course
of
conduct.
and
that
can
be
shown,
as
turkette
explained,
by
evidence
of
some
kind
of
ongoing
organization,
formal
or
informal,
that
--
whose
associates
function
as
an
ongoing
unit.
and
in
order
to
prove
through
one's
actions
with
others
that
there
is
a
entity
--
some
agreement
and
continuing
unit
behind
that,
you're
going
to
have
to
show
some
identity
in
the
group.
if
there's
no
identity
except
for
one
person,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
show
an
enterprise.
mr.
anthony
yang
it
would
be
difficult
to
show
an
associated
--
association-in-fact.
i'm
sorry.
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
an
association-in-fact
of
more
than
one
person
as
the
enterprise
in
that
context,
because
it
would
be
difficult
to
show
that
that
person
had
joined
with
others
for
the
common
purpose
of
engaging
in
a
course
of
common
conduct.
it
would
just
be
a
series
of
distinct
crimes.
mr.
anthony
yang
that
was
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
because
under
1962(c),
there
has
to
be
distinctiveness
in
that
context.
mr.
anthony
yang
no.
it's--
mr.
anthony
yang
--well,
rico
requires,
among
other
things,
a
pattern
of
racketeering.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
they
can
be
related,
but
under
this
court's
decision
in
h.j.,
you
also
have
to
show
continuing
criminal
conduct.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
no,
no.
but
that
has
a
particular
meaning
under
h.j.,
which
is
that
it
has
to
extend
over
an
extended
period
of
time.
mr.
anthony
yang
well,
again,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
meet
either
the
continuing
aspect,
either
because
it's
a
threat
of
continuing
activity
or
because
it
would
satisfy
the
close
in
continuity.
mr.
anthony
yang
i
think
i
agree
with
that
proposition.
mr.
anthony
yang
but
--
but
the
--
what
needs
to
be
shown
is
that
there
needs
to
be
an
enterprise.
sometimes
the
enterprise
in
cases
are
--
are
lawful
enterprises;
sometimes
in
cases
it
involves
a
unlawful
organization,
and
unlawful
association-in-fact,
like
we
have
here.
and
that
is
shown
--
the
statutory
requirement,
as
explained
in
turkette,
is
simply
that
this
group
of
people
associate
together
for
a
common
purpose
of
engaging
in
a
course
of
conduct.
now,
when
you
have
a
long
--
a
series,
like
we
have
here
of
--
of
crimes
--
these
sets
of
crimes
went
on
for
almost
a
decade,
involved
dozens
and
dozens
of
bank
thefts
and--
mr.
anthony
yang
--yes.
that
concerns
the
predicate
acts
of
racketeering.
this
is
--
this
raises
another
important
issue,
which
is,
the
--
the
group
largely
was
committing
bank
burglaries.
those
are
not
predicate
acts.
the
predicate
acts
here
under
rico
involve
the
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
funds.
there
were
three
of
those
that
were
charged
as
predicate
acts,
and
the
jury
found
those
to
constitute
a
pattern.
but
what
this
group
of
individuals
were
doing,
is
they
were
associating
in
fact
for
a
very
long
period
of
time,
committing
dozens
of
bank
--
bank
burglaries,
and
did
so
sometimes
with
the
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
funds.
that's
what
brought--
mr.
anthony
yang
--oh,
there
were
many
things
shown
to
the
jury.
mr.
anthony
yang
i
have
to
say--
mr.
anthony
yang
--i
have
to
say
that
the
--
i'm
a
little
perplexed
at
this
stage
in
the
litigation
based
--
how
--
how
we
got
here
based
on
the
objection
that
was
made
to
the
district
court.
the
objection
that
was
made,
which
was
a
ja
95,
was
that
there's
an
ascertainable
structural
hierarchy,
which
seems
to
be
abandoned
at
this
point,
distinct
from
the
charged
predicate
acts
of
racketeering.
that
was
repeated
at
103,
108,
and
109.
and
then
there
was
also
an
objection
that
the
--
the
entity
has
to
have
a
particular
or
formed
structure,
and
that
--
that's
been
abandoned
and
also
inconsistent
with
turkette,
which
recognized
that
this
can
be
an
informal
association.
and,
in
fact,
there
was
not
an
objection
to
the
entire
charge.
there
--
counsel
at
page
ja
97,
after
--
when
the
court
explained
that
it
was
going
to
address
his
proposed
charge
at
ja
95,
said,
you
know,
i
have
some
specific
objections
to
the
charge
as
written
and
then
went
through
them,
and
raising
those
two
objections
as
we've
just
discussed
here.
so,
we've
kind
of
evolved
in
terms
of
what
this
case
is
all
about.
and
even
if
the
petitioner
were
right,
i
don't
think
he
could
prevail,
even
under
the
charge
he
wants
in
this
case.
but
let
me
turn
to
a
few
anomalies
with
respect
to
petitioner's
interpretation
of
a
structure.
mr.
anthony
yang
it
will
make
a
difference
in
some
cases.
there's
a
case
called
bagaric
that
this
court
cited
in
its
national
organization
against
--
for
women
against
scheidler.
in
there,
there
was
a
--
bagaric
involved
a
group
of
croatian
nationalists,
loosely
knit,
who
agreed
to
kind
of
promote
their
anti-yugoslavian
agenda
through
a
series
of
acts
that
they
committed
over
a
number
of
years,
extortion,
murder,
bombings.
there
was
no
structure.
it
would
be
very
difficult,
i
think,
to
fit
into
the
ascertainable
structure
distinct
from
the
predicate
acts
of
racketeering
that
petitioner
espouses.
there
are
other
cases
involving
loosely
knit
groups
of
gangs
such
as
neighborhood
thugs.
the
nascimento
case
involved
a
neighborhood
group
of
thugs
who
protected
each
other,
and
that
was
their
common
--
common
bonding
element
through
ultimately
killing
rivals
or
intimidating
witnesses.
there's
no
hierarchy
there.
there
were
no
colors,
no
initiation
rights.
but
this
went
on
over
a
long
period
of
time.
but
beyond
those
--
the
classic
cases
that
might
fall
outside
rico,
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
an
ascertainable
structure
requirement,
i
think
as
petitioner's
laundry
list
of
--
of
examples
at
--
and
the
last
five
pages
of
his
reply
brief
illustrate
--
that
is
going
to
involve
a
long
course
of
case-by-case
adjudication.
mr.
anthony
yang
let
me
first
address
what
i
think
is
your
underlying
concern,
that
there's
a
problem.
turkette
addressed
that.
turkette
addressed
that
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
evidence
used
to
--
to
establish
these
separate
elements
may
in
cases--
mr.
anthony
yang
--that
problem
does
not
exist
as
well,
because
the
relevant
--
the
relevant
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
that
is
the
element
of
the
crime
is
something
committed
by
an
individual.
for
instance,
let's
take
a
group
of
individuals
who
commit
a
long
string
of,
for
instance,
bank
burglaries.
they
do
so
over
a
series
of
years.
bank
burglary
is
not
a
predicate
act
of
racketeering.
it's
a
wholly
criminal
organization.
all
they
do
is
commit
bank
burglaries.
one
individual
is
given
the
money
at
the
end
of
the
--
of
each
burglary.
that
individual
transports
the
money
interstate.
what
we
would
have
there
is
a
rico
violation
as
to
the
individual,
because
the
individual
--
the
element
is
that
the
individual
has
transported
the
money
in
interstate
transportation
--
or
across
state
lines,
and
that
is
a
rico
predicate.
but
the
other
things
that
the
--
the
group
was
doing,
those
are
not
rico
predicates.
mr.
anthony
yang
so
--
so
the
element
--
it
doesn't
change.
if
the
individual
then
does
it
with
some
other
people
--
let's
say
he
brings
his
buddy
along.
two
of
them
do
it.
that
just
shows
the
evidence
necessary
to
show
that
the
individual
--
the
evidence
showed
that
the
individual
committed
a
pattern
of
racketeering,
also
happens
to
show
that
he
did
it
with
a
group.
but
it's
the
evidence,
not
the
element.
the
element
of
the
crime
in
section
1962(c)
always
turns
on
the
defendants--
mr.
anthony
yang
--but
if
you
have--
mr.
anthony
yang
--if
you
take
the--
mr.
anthony
yang
--my
--
my
hypothetical
with
the
individual
transporting
the
--
the
money
alone
across
state
lines,
you
have
a
pattern.
if
you
just
looked
at
that,
individual
taking
money
across
state
lines
by
himself,
that
doesn't
establish
an
enterprise.
what
would
--
so
the
pattern
exists
independently.
what
would
show
the
enterprise
is
the
fact
that
the
evidence
might
also
show
that
he's
doing
it
with
other
people.
that
would
show
that
he
--
the
element,
that
is
--
he
is
committing
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
and
he's
doing
it
in
concert
with
others,
but
that
goes
to
the
separate
element
of
enterprise.
that
is--
mr.
anthony
yang
--let
me--
mr.
anthony
yang
--let
me
try
to
approach
that
in
two
separate
ways.
one,
turkette
in
footnote
5
was
very
clear.
the
court
explained
even
if
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
and
the
enterprise
are
established
the
same
way,
it
doesn't
matter.
if
enterprise
has
function
--
some
function
--
there's
no
such
thing
as,
in
other
words,
partial
superfluidity
of
an
element,
or
partial
superfluidity
of
--
of
a
word.
secondly,
the
concern
about
conspiracy
exists
in
any
conspiracy.
conspiracy
is
a
inchoate
act.
you
are
liable
for
a
conspiracy
as
soon
as
you've
made
the
agreement
and,
under
371,
commit
an
overt
act
or,
under
rico
conspiracy,
agree
to
all
the
necessary
elements
of
a
substantive
rico
offense.
congress
has
--
and
not
only
that,
you
can
be
charged
for
a
conspiracy
and
charged
for
completing
the
conspiracy
as
separate
crimes.
that's
the
normal
rule.
that's
the
normal
rule
here.
you
can
be
charged
for
a
conspiracy
to
commit
rico
offenses.
in
rico
offenses,
the
pattern
element
i
don't
think
can
be
underestimated
here.
the
pattern
element
is
where
rico
has
--
plus
the
--
the
list
of
predicate
acts
of
racketeering
--
is
really
where
rico
gets
most
of
its
limiting
structure.
and
i
think
the
court
recognized
that
in
h.j.
it's
the
pattern
which
requires
related
criminal
acts
that
can
be
related
in
a
number
of
ways,
m.o.
--
the
court
gave
kind
of
a
list
of
--
of
that
in
h.j.,
which
i
think
i
won't
go
through
now,
but
--
as
well
as
continuity,
and
that
can
be
long-term
criminal
activity,
not
just
a
single
or
two,
but
long-term
criminal
activity,
or
the
threat
of
criminal
activity.
interestingly
enough--
mr.
anthony
yang
--no.
i
mean,
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
--
ascertainable
structure
distinct--
mr.
anthony
yang
--it's
very
--
i
have
to
say
it's
difficult
for
me
to
understand
what
is
being
proposed
by
the
other
side,
particularly
once
you've
lost
hierarchy.
hierarchy
is
something
which
is
an
understandable
term.
mr.
anthony
yang
but
if
you're
talking
about
structure,
structure
could
mean
relationship
between
individuals
that
enable
them
to--
mr.
anthony
yang
--commit
their
crimes.
if
that's
the
case--
mr.
anthony
yang
--i
don't
see
why
a
jury
cannot
infer
from
the
fact,
over
a
long
period
of
time,
that
the
--
the
alleged
members
of
this
group
have
operated
as
a
unit
and
have
committed
acts
of
racketeering,
from
that
coordinated
conduct
that
you're
not
able
to
infer
that
they
had
a
means
of
acting
as
a
group.
mr.
anthony
yang
must
--
must
the
jury--
mr.
anthony
yang
--what
does
that
mean?
mr.
anthony
yang
because
turkette
makes
very
clear
that
an
association-in-fact
enterprise
can
exist
for
wholly
criminal
acts.
so
if
--
if,
for
instance
--
take
a
few
hypotheticals.
let's
say
a
group
forms
for
the
basis
of
committing
just
only
predicate
acts
of
racketeering.
they
do
that.
nothing
else,
just
predicate
acts,
over
a
10-year
period.
mr.
anthony
yang
all
right?
one
formulation
of
petitioner's
is
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
charged
pattern
of
racketeering
acts,
presumably
because
then
the
jury
has
to
find
the
charged
pattern
and
then
that
has
to
be
distinct
from
the
enterprise.
if
that's
the
case
--
let's
say
there's
100
predicate
acts
of
racketeering.
all
that
does
is
say
that
the
government
has
to
show
99
and
just
leave
the
last
one
uncharged.
that
makes
no
sense.
to
the
extent
that
petitioner
is
saying,
okay,
there's
got
to
be
some
--
something
other
than
racketeering
activity.
take,
for
instance,
the
group
that
does
--
wholly
legal,
but
does
criminal
non-racketeering
acts
as
well
as
racketeering
acts.
that's
in
fact
this
case.
bank
robberies
and
--
excuse
me,
bank
burglaries,
which
is
not
a
predicate
act,
and
interstate
transportation
of
funds.
it
would
be
wholly
anomalous
to
exclude
a
group
that
only
did
bank
robberies,
which
are
predicate
acts,
but
include
a
group
that
was
only
partially
racketeering
but
wholly
criminal
because--
mr.
anthony
yang
--but
there's
nothing
--
there's
--
in
order
to
find
an
organization,
you're
not
going
to
see
any
more
from
criminal
acts
that
are
not
racketeering
versus
criminal
acts
that
are.
both
of
them
show--
mr.
anthony
yang
--they
might.
mr.
anthony
yang
you
--
yes,
but
there
has
to
be
more.
you
have
to
explain
what
would
be
necessary
to
show
an
enterprise.
and
in
fact,
the
--
the
appendix
to
the
court
of--
mr.
anthony
yang
--i
believe
page
17.
mr.
anthony
yang
page
17
of
our
brief
reiterates
the
standard.
i
believe
it's
turkette.
it
comes
from
turkette.
and
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
--
or
excuse
me,
the
joint
appendix
--
the
charge
is
at
pages
111
through
113.
that's
the
charge.
mr.
anthony
yang
but
it
goes
on
to
say
that
you
must
--
the
government
must
prove
that
there
is
an
ongoing
organization
with
some
sort
of
framework,
formal
and
informal,
for
carrying
out
its
objectives,
and
various
members
and
associations
of
the
association
function
as
a
continuing
unit
to
achieve
a
common
objective.
the
government
must
prove
that
in
every
case.
in
this
case,
this
is
not
in
the
ja,
but
it
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
appendix
at
page
a-770.
the
district
court
specifically
charged
the
jury
that
they
must
find
five
separate
elements
of
a
rico
offense,
including
the
existence
of
an
enterprise
as
one;
two,
that
the
enterprise
engaged
in
or
its
activities
affected
interstate
or
foreign
commerce;
three,
that
the
defendant
was
associated
in
it.
eventually
you
get
down
to
five,
that
the
defendant
knowingly
participated
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
the
enterprise
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
so
the
--
the
district
court
explained
you
have
to
define
an
enterprise.
and
to
find
an
enterprise,
what's
a
necessary
element,
it
said
you
may
infer
an
enterprise
from
what
it--
mr.
anthony
yang
--it
is
different
in
the
sense
that
you
can
have
a
series
of
predicate
acts
without
an
enterprise;
you
can
have
an
enterprise
without
a
series
of
predicate
acts.
now,
the
objection
seems
to
be
ultimately
that
the
evidence
used
to
show
the
predicate
acts
of
racketeering
may
also
prove
that
the
enterprise
exists,
because
when
you
show
predicate
acts
of
a
defendant,
which
is
the
only
element
--
it
doesn't
have
to
work
in
concert
with
others
to
commit
the
predicate
acts
of
racketeering,
but
when
you
show
the
predicate
acts
with
evidence
that
individual
is
acting
with
others,
you
can
also
show
that
they
have
--
there
is
an
association-in-fact
of
individuals
who
have
joined
together
to
pursue
a
common
course
of
conduct.
thank
you,
your
honors.
