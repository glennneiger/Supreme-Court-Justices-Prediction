mr.
fernich--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
we
talking
just
about
the
instruction
to
the
jury?
i
know
you
think
that
the
instruction
given
here
was
incorrect.
but
is
--
is
it
just
a
question
of
charge
error,
or
are
you
saying
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
of
enterprise
for
this
case
to
go
to
the
jury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
if
a
proper
charge
had
been
given,
this
jury
on
this
evidence
still
could
have
convicted
the
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
make
that
--
did
you
make
that
objection
in
the
trial
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
--
what
does
"structure"
mean?
i
think
you
said
it
doesn't
mean
that
this
has
to
be
an
organization
with
a
president,
a
treasurer;
it
doesn't
mean
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
--
what
is
the
minimum
to
qualify
as
having
a
structure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
does
the
jury
--
the
words
that
you
asked
for
--
what
was
it?
"ascertainable
structural
hierarchy".
and
suppose
the
judge
gets
questions
from
the
jury,
your
honor,
what
do
you
mean
by
ascertainable
structural
hierarchy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
those
were
the
words
that
you
wanted
the
judge
to
include
in
the
charge--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
your
request
for
the
charge,
as
to
say
to
have
an
enterprise
you
need
to
have
--
the
group
has
to
have
an
ascertainable
structural
hierarchy.
those
are
the
three
words
in
--
in
your
request
for
the
charge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
those
--
but
you
did
ask
for
those.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
now
i'm
asking
you,
what
does
that
mean?
the
judge
gives
your
charge,
the
jury
is
puzzled.
your
honor,
we
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
ascertainable
structural
hierarchy.
would
you
please
tell
us
specifically?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
some
of
those
examples,
it
seems,
are
present
here.
one
you
gave
was
longevity.
well,
this
has
been
going
on
for
10
years,
is
it?
another
was
a
unique
way
of
operating.
and
they
are
specialists
in
deposit
boxes
and
they
have
look-out
people
and
they
have
people
who
actually
break
into
the
bank,
and
they
have
a
certain
amount
of
skill.
so
we
have
longevity,
modus
operandi,
and
a
division
of
labor.
they
have
some
people
being
their
lookouts
and
other
people
doing
other
things.
so
i
was
looking
at
your
list
in
the
reply
brief,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
organization,
this
association
of
individuals,
has
some
of
those
characteristics.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
would
--
would
it
include,
let's
say,
a
street
gang?
how
about
--
this
may
be
before
your
time,
but
the
lavender
hill
mob?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
an
alec
guiness
movie,
the
lavender
hill
mob.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
there
a
record
that
this
is
a
more
or
less
steady
group
that
hangs
out
together,
except
when
one
of
them
gets
caught
and
put
in
jail,
and
then
they
replace
someone?
but
this
is
--
i
thought
this
was
explained
as
a
group
that
meets
regularly
in
the
brooklyn
social
club?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
of
the
members
owned
the
club.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
during
the
period
that
this
man
--
what
was
his
name?
mangia--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
well,
he
was
running
the
show.
it
seems
that
he
was
a
leader,
and
that
--
and
that
the
group
wasn't
quite
as
democratic
before
he
got
sent
to
prison.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
wasn't
what
i
meant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
meant,
would
the
organization,
as
it
was
described
to
exist
at
the
time
mangiavillano
was
there
--
would
that
have
satisfied
the
definition
of
"structure"
because
it
had
a
leader?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
do
that,
mr.
yang,
could
you
give
us
a
sense,
if
you
know
it,
about
the
practical
results
of
the
different
formulas
that
--
there
are
at
least
three
formulas,
i
take
it,
that
the
different
circuits
have
approved.
in
--
in
the
result
of
the
rico
prosecutions,
does
it
really
make
a
difference
which
one
of
these
is
charged,
or
do
they
could
out
the
same
way
anyway?
