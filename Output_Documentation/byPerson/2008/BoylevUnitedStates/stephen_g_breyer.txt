stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
try
something
out
in
your
mind?
maybe
you
can't
react
to
it.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
how
--
the
structure
requirement,
what
to
say.
and
a
thought
that
is
occurring
to
me,
which
i
am
not
wedded
to
--
but
i'd
like
some
reactions
to
it
--
is
to
say
that
there
is
a
structure
means
that
among
this
association
of
people
there
must
be
rules,
understandings,
or
behavior
that
tend
to
keep
the
association
together
over
time,
other
than
those
which
would
be
essential
to
allow
them
to
commit
the
particular
crimes
at
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
know,
but
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
work
out
in
my
mind
is
that
a
sensible
thing
to
say
because
the
trouble
with
the
word
"structure"
is
everything
in
the
universe
has
a
structure.
and
so
it's
awfully
vague,
and
i'm
trying
to
make
it
a
little
bit
more
specific.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
what
i
said.
i
said
rules,
understandings,
forms
of
behavior
that
tend
to
keep
the
association
together
over
time,
other
than
those
rules,
understandings
and
--
and
behaviors
that
would
be
necessary
--
necessary
meant
strongly
--
to
commit
the
particular
crimes
at
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
say
individual,
the
first
part
of
the
definition
of
enterprise
speaks
about
any
individual
partnership,
corporation,
association,
or
other
legal
entity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then,
i've
read
somewhere
that
people
feel
that
where
that
individual
is
involved,
the
individual
is
acting
as
an
--
a
legal
entity
such
as
a
sole
proprietorship.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
talking
about
a
legal
entity.
and
in
the
second
clause,
what
we're
talking
about
here,
specifically,
it
is
a
corporation,
a
union,
or
a
group
of
individuals
associated
in
fact,
although
not
a
legal
entity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
two
people
--
two
people
walk
along
the
street
and
know
each
other.
that's
posner's
example.
and
one
of
them
says
i
have
a
great
idea.
let's
go
in
and
take
some
money
out
of
the
post
office.
the
other
says,
what
happens
if
a
policeman
comes?
the
first
one
says,
we'll
bribe
him.
okay?
then
they
do
it.
that's
it.
period.
now,
of
course
that's
illegal.
but
is
rico
supposed
to
catch
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
is
it
that
keeps
them
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
here
we
have
two
--
two
--
two
related
crimes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
was
between
the
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
is
the
bribery.
i
mean,
what
happens
if
3
months
from
now
the
postal
inspector
comes
to
catch
us?
we'll
bribe
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
you're
quite
right.
i
agree
with
you
that
these
are
different
efforts
to
try
to
catch
the
same
problem.
and
the
problem
is
that
i
don't
think
anyone
sees
that
the
simple
conspiracy
and
carrying
out
of
two
criminal
offenses
by
several
people
together
without
more
--
without
something
more
--
should
violate
rico.
i
think
your
answer
to
that
will
be
you
agree
with
that,
but
tell
me
if
you
don't.
and
then
if
you
do
agree
with
it,
the
very
difficult
problem
is
to
figure
out
how
to
get
the
people
to
clearly
show--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
agree
with
the
first
part?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
did
you
think
--
what
did
you
think
of
the
--
probably
not
much
of
it,
but
what
did
you
think
of
my
effort
there?
and
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
point
out,
as
you
see,
i'm
open
to
anything
that
will
deal
with
what
i
think
of
as
a
functional
problem
and
the
functional
problem
is
exhibited
by
that
posner
example
i
gave
you
or
by
two
investment
companies
that
decide
what
we'll
do
is
we'll
issue
a
letter
that's
going
to
be
shown
to
two
different
people
--
that's
their
only
association
--
or
maybe
100
people,
but
they
know
who
they
are,
and
they're
going
to
be
shown
this
letter
over
a
period
of
5
or
10
years,
and
someone
later
comes
back
and
says
there's
a
false
statement
in
the
letter.
well,
they
shouldn't
issue
a
false
statement,
but
is
that
rico?
i
mean,
so
--
so
the
object
--
the
object
is
to
find
a
way
of
not
overextending
rico
where
there
is
nothing
there
but
a
conspiracy
to
commit
two
crimes.
pattern
is
one
help.
the
pattern
is
pretty
vague,
so
all
the
courts
but
one
have
come
along,
i
take
it,
with
this
other
help,
which
is
playing
on
the
word
"structure".
now,
you
heard
what
i
said
is
--
is
a
weak
effort
to
try
to
do
something.
what
is
your
best
effort
to
do
something
to
deal
with
the
problem?
or
what's
wrong
with
my
effort?
whatever
you
want
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
different.
that's
--
of
course,
the
same
evidence
can
establish
two
separate
elements.
the
problem
will
be
conflating
the
elements
so
that
every
single
case
that
you
have
the
first
set,
you
also
have
the
second
set.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
that
--
always,
in
a
case
where
you
sue
the
investment
company
because
of
their
one
letter
used
four
times,
it's
the
act
of
the
individual.
in
the
case
that
posner
used,
it's
always
the
act
of
the
individual.
there's
always
a
criminal
act
of
an
individual.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he
has
to
be
associated,
however,
with
an
enterprise
for
it
to
fall
within
rico,
and
there
also
has
to
be
a
pattern.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
go
back--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
right,
and
our
problem
is
he's
doing
it
with
one
other
person
whom
he
met
once,
and
they
agreed
to
do
it,
and
that's
a
common
law
conspiracy.
and
now
suddenly
he's
done
it
twice
with
another
person
who
helped
him
and
they
said
they'd
do
it,
and
now
we
have
rico.
and
my
belief
is
--
which
you
may
not
agree
with
--
that
that
common
garden-variety
conspiracy
to,
say,
rob
a
bank
and
then
transport
the
money
a
few
months
later,
that
that's
all
that's
at
issue.
that
shouldn't
be
within
rico.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
might
come
back
and
tell
me
it
should
be.
