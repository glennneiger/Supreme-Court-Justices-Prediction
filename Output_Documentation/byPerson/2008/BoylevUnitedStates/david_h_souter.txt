justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
--
you
couldn't,
could
you,
because
the
--
an
organization
can
consist
of
an
individual.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
all
of
the
requirements
that
you've
been
specifying
would
in
an
individual
case
be
met
simply
by
showing
that
there
was
--
there
was
an
individual
in
business
who
had
a
brain.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
i
set
up
a
newsstand,
it's
a
sole
proprietorship
and
that's
all
i
have
to
do.
and
if
--
if
i
have
a
--
a
functioning
brain,
i
have
a
decision-making
mechanism.
i
remember
from
day-to-day
what
i
did,
so
i
have
continuity.
and
--
and
it
seems
to
me
that
all
of
these
requirements
are
--
are
virtually
satisfied
as
a
matter
of
course
by
an
individual
who
engages
in
any
kind
of
business
that
might
have
interstate
commerce
implications.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
absolutely.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
--
it
puts
you
in
sort
of
a
--
a
difficult
position
to
--
to
be
calling
for
or
--
or
requiring
jury
instructions
that
call
for,
as
necessary
conditions,
findings
of
structure,
continuity,
decision-making
capacity,
and
so
on,
when
in
fact
on
--
on
at
least
one
variety
of
enterprise,
these
conditions
are
--
are
met
virtually
automatically
simply
by
having
somebody
doing
business
in
any
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
agree,
but
an
individual
can
be
an
--
an
enterprise.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
--
and
an
association-infact
can
be
an
enterprise.
and
if
we
accept
those
two
propositions,
then
i
think
you've
got
a
tough
row
to
hoe
in
saying
that
any
enterprise
which
is
not
an
individual
has
got
to
have
all
the
formal
characteristics
that
you
talk
about,
given
the
fact
that
those
characteristics
are
automatically
satisfied
by
an
individual.
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
i
guess
that's
where
i'm
--
i'm
losing
the
argument.
why
is
it
difficult?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
don't
you
dispense
with
the
association-in-fact
category
and
simply
go
with
the
individual?
