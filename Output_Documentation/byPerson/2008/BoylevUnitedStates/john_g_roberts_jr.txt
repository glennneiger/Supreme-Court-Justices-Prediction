chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
in
case
07-1309,
boyle
v.
united
states.
mr.
fernich.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
all
you
have
to
do,
to
pick
up
on
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
just
not
the
brinks
job,
but
you
have
to
have
one
more
crime,
and
that's
it.
then
everything
you've
talked
about
is
satisfied.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fernich.
mr.
yang.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
then
you'd
have
an
easy
time
before
the
jury.
and
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
the
individual.
all
that's
saying
is
that
when
you're
dealing
with
one
person,
it's
pretty
easy
to
prove
that
he,
you
know,
directs
himself
or,
you
know,
has
an
ongoing
plan,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it's
not
a
separate
element
that
the
jury
should
have
to
find.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
say
that
it's
not
distinct
from
the
underlying
offenses.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
don't
have
to
be
separately
instructed
that
they
have
to
find
that,
do
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
instruction
that
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit
give
that
you
don't
think
is
necessary?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
an
individual
could
--
i
thought
an
individual
could
be
the
enterprise?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he's
an
independent
contractor
rather
than
an
employee.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
friend
said
the
period
that
the
jury
found
was
just
a
couple
of
months.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
at
all.
that
would
make
a
lot
of
sense,
because
rico
is
not
intended
just
to
bring
in
the
crimes.
they're
looking
for
something
else.
they're
looking
for
an
organization
that
is
involved
in
these
types
of
things.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
an
enterprise.
i
mean,
the
objection
is
that
the
enterprise
is
no
different
than
the
various
predicate
acts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
yang.
mr.
fernich,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
the
opinion
this
morning
in
07-1309
boyle
versus
united
states.
