justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
error
was
the
failure
to
give
the
instruction
that
appears
on
page
95
of
the
joint
appendix?
is
that
the
error
that
you're
complaining
about?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
hierarchy
isn't
required,
then
i'm
not
clear
what
more
--
what
you
think
needs
to
be
shown
beyond
the
fact
that
there
was
an
association
in
fact
and
whatever
continuity
needs
to
be
shown
in
order
to
establish
the
pattern.
what
--
what
needs
to
be
shown
beyond
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
needs
to
be
charged
to
the
jury
that
they
must
find
beyond
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
does
that
mean?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
--
i--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--suppose
you
have
a
gang
that
gets
together
every
friday
afternoon,
and
by
democratic
means,
they
decide
what
crime
they're
going
to
commit
that
weekend.
and
they're
multi-talented
so
they
--
they
look
at
the
whole
list
of
rico
predicates,
and
they
choose
a
different
one
each
--
you
know,
each
weekend
to
commit.
and
they
do
that
over
some
period
of
time.
and
in
doing
that,
they
perform
different
roles
at
different
times.
is
that
an
enterprise?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
we'll
take
that
part
out
of
it.
they
don't
look
at
the
statute.
they
just
--
whatever
crime
comes
to
somebody's
mind.
they
--
they
want
to
commit
a
crime
every
weekend
to
--
to
make
some
money.
but
it's
a
different
thing,
done
by
different
means,
different
roles.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
that
--
does
that
have
an
ascertainable
structure?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
structure
would
there
be
there?
what
characteristics
of
that
group
would
satisfy
the
structural
requirement?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
you
agree
there
--
there
can
be
a
situation
in
which
an
individual
engages
in
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
together
with
other
people
and
yet
is
not
participating
in
the
affairs
of
an
enterprise
through
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
is
--
why
would
it
not?
what--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what's
lacking
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
he
has
a
list
of
--
of
25
people
who
may,
on
various
occasions,
want
to
participate
with
him
in
bank
robberies?
so
whenever
he
gets
the
urge
to
commit
a
bank
robbery,
he
gets
out
his
rolodex
and
he
picks
one
or
more
of
them
and
calls
them
up
and
they
commit
the
bank
robbery.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
but
what's
the
element
then
that's
missing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
is
before
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted
of
violating
the
rico
act
by
participating
in
the
affairs
of
an
enterprise
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
the
evidence
at
trial
was
sufficient
to
show
that
petitioner
and
other
members
of
a
loose
and
informal
group
without
any
hierarchal
structure
or
long
term
plan
committed
a
series
of
bank
robberies
over
a
period
of
years.
the
district
courts
during
instruction
on
the
meaning
of
a
rico
enterprise
relied
primarily
on
our
decision
in
united
states
v.
turkette.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
court
erred
in
refusing
to
give
a
requested
defense
instruction
to
the
effect
that
an
association
in
fact
enterprise
under
rico
must
have
“an
ascertainable
structure”
beyond
that
inherent
in
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
in
which
it
engages.
we
hold
that
an
enterprise
must
have
certain
structural
features
but
not
those
identified
by
petitioner
and
that
an
instruction
that
refers
specifically
to
the
concept
of
structure
is
not
necessary.
we
therefore
hold
that
the
district
court
properly
instructed
the
jury
in
this
case
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer
has
joined.
