mr.
marc
fernich
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
a
defendant's
right
to
an
independent
jury
determination
of
each
essential
element
of
a
rico
offense,
specifically
a
pattern
of
racketeering
and
a
separate
enterprise
that
is
more
than
just
a
duplication
of
the
pattern.
to
keep
the
elements
apart,
ensure
their
distinct
consideration,
and
give
the
enterprise
independent
meaning,
juries
must
be
instructed,
as
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
elsewhere,
that
an
enterprise
requires
a
structure
separate
from
the
commission
of
the
predicate
acts
forming
the
pattern.
mr.
marc
fernich
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
fernich
i
am
not
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
of
--
of
enterprise
to
go
to
the
jury.
my
primary
point
is
with
respect
to
the
charge.
we
do
contend--
mr.
marc
fernich
--we
contend,
to
be
sure,
that
the
evidence
was
legally
insufficient
under
rule
29.
but
we
are
pressing
principally
the
first
--
the
jury
argument
claim
here
in
this
court.
we
do
contend
that
the
evidence
was
legally
insufficient.
mr.
marc
fernich
yes,
we
did,
and
we
preserved
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
well.
and
there
was,
as
your
honor
knows,
no
published
opinion
with
respect
to
either
issue.
so
both
issues
are
preserved.
now,
your
honor,
under
a
second
circuit
rule
that
functionally
conflates
the
two
elements
--
that
is,
enterprise
and
pattern
--
the
jury
in
this
case
was
not
so
instructed
as
to
the
need
for
an
enterprise
with
an
existence
separate
and
apart
from
the
racketeering
acts
forming
the
pattern.
for
that
reason,
we
contend
that
the
judgment
below
must
be
vacated.
mr.
marc
fernich
not
merely
so,
justice
alito.
that's
why
the
entire
relevant
excerpts
from
the
jury
charge
are
included
in
the
joint
appendix.
we
objected
to
the
entirety
of
the
charge,
in
addition
to
requesting
specific
language
of
our
own.
to
be
sure,
the
principal
error
of
which
we
complain
in
this
court
is
the
failure
of
that
instruction
anywhere
to
require,
as
this
court
required
in
the
united
states
v
turkette,
and
as
18
u.s.c.
1962(c)
itself
requires,
an
entity
with
a
structure
separate
and
apart
from
the
pattern
of
racketeering.
mr.
marc
fernich
to
be
sure,
we
would
contend
that
it
would
be
a
question
in
the
first
instance
for
a
properly
instructed
jury,
but
without
more
on
the
hypothetical
that
your
honor
has
posited,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
there
is
no
ongoing
decisional
apparatus,
no
continuing
directional
mechanism.
mr.
marc
fernich
except
the
degree
of
organization,
i
should
say,
inherent
in
each
individual
predicate
act.
mr.
marc
fernich
to
be
sure,
your
honor,
we
don't
contend
that
turkette
is
directly
controlling
of
the
issue,
and
we
go
through
a
lengthy
textual
exegesis
in
our
brief
of
why
we
think
that
implicit
in
the
factors
of
ongoing
organization
and
continuing
unit
is
a
structure
requirement.
but
what
turkette
did
unequivocally
say
is
that
there
must
be
an
entity
existing
separate
and
apart
from
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
there
was
no
such
instruction
given
in
this
case
--
and
the
word
1961(4)
itself
and
appears
twice
in
this
turkette's
decision,
surely
connotes
an
ascertainable
structure
with
an
existence
separate
and
apart
from
the
pattern
of
racketeering.
mr.
marc
fernich
it
could
mean
that
in
an
appropriate
case,
your
honor.
it
surely
would
be
probative--
mr.
marc
fernich
--the
minimum
is
a
separate,
ongoing,
continuing
existence
apart
from
the
commission
of
the
predicate
acts
themselves,
and
the
members
necessary
to
commit
those
predicate
acts,
because
that
by
--
by
definition,
i
should
say,
is
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
and
moreover,
it
is
also
inherent
in
any
criminal
conspiracy
that
extends
over
time.
to
be
more
specific,
the
bare
minimum
requisites
for
a
structure
would
be:
an
ongoing
directional
mechanism;
a
continuing
decisional-making
unit
--
decision-making
unit,
i
should
say
--
and
some
sort
of
coherent
existence
between
the
commission
of
the
racketeering
acts
themselves.
those
are
the
main
ingredients.
mr.
marc
fernich
no,
that
--
that's,
respectfully,
not
what
we
contend,
although
in
an
appropriate
case
it's
conceivable
that
a
properly
instructed
jury
may
find
structure
on
those
facts.
the
point
that
we're
conveying
here
is
that
this
is
principally
a
jury
question,
and
a
jury
that's
properly
instructed
will
make
findings,
presumably,
as
to
what
the
--
whether
the
structure
was
extant,
and
those
findings
would
command
substantial
deference
on
appeal,
as
they
do
in
the
circuits
that
have
applied
a
structure
requirement.
and
it
would
be
a
relatively
easy
task
for
an
appellate
court
to
defer
to
the
jury's
findings
in
such
a
case.
there
is--
mr.
marc
fernich
--i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
marc
fernich
to
be
sure.
mr.
marc
fernich
well,
respectfully,
your
honor,
it
goes
beyond
that,
because
the
end
of--
mr.
marc
fernich
--i
did,
and--
mr.
marc
fernich
--yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
charge
that
we're
asking
for
specifically
is
a
charge
that
is
given
in
the
seventh
and
eighth
circuit
which
says
a
structure
separate
from
the
commission
of
the
predicate
acts
themselves.
if
a
jury
were
puzzled,
in
that
instance
the
judge
could,
as
spelled
out
at
pages
31
through
35
of
our
reply
brief,
give
examples,
any
number
of
examples
that
have
been
spelled
out
by
the
lower
courts
in
--
that
have
adopted
a
structure
requirement.
mr.
marc
fernich
your
honor,
first
of
all,
to
--
to
get
right
down
to
the
nitty-gritty
of
the
verdict
in
the
case,
it's
important
to
focus
on
what
the
jury
actually
found.
the
enterprise
as
charged
was
a
10-year
enterprise.
there
were
three
predicate
acts
found
by
the
jury
ranging
in
date
from
late
december
of
1998
through
early
january
of
1999.
so
the
longevity
aspect
is
certainly
something
that
we
dispute
here.
again,
to
answer
your
honor,
to
go
back
to
the
--
the
beginning
of
our
argument,
to
be
sure,
the
thrust
of
our
argument
in
this
court
is
directed
to
the
jury
instruction
in
this
case.
it
may
be
conceivable
--
we
don't
for
a
minute
concede
that
the
evidence
was
legally
sufficient
under
rule
29.
that
said,
had
a
jury
been
properly
instructed
and
made
such
a
finding,
i.e.,
to
find
a
separately
structured
enterprise,
that
would
be
a
finding
that
would
command
significant
deference,
and
i'd
be
hardpressed--
mr.
marc
fernich
--we
don't
contend
before
this
court
that
it
must
be
hierarchical
per
se.
certainly
to--
mr.
marc
fernich
--i
--
i--
mr.
marc
fernich
--on
the
facts
of
this
case,
consistent
with
the
examples
that
are
spelled
out
comprehensively
in
both
the
opening
brief
and
the
reply
brief,
that
is
the
one
that
we
focused
on.
but
to
be
sure
--
to
be
sure,
i
also
objected
to
the
charge
as
given
in
its
entirety.
in
this
court
we
don't
press
the
contention
that
a
hierarchical
structure
--
hierarchical
structure
is
an
irreducible
minimum.
we
do--
mr.
marc
fernich
--an
individual,
your
honor,
is
--
is
a
legal
entity
under
the
first
clause
of
1961(4).
it
means
a
sole
proprietorship
in
this
context.
and
an
individual,
a
legal
entity,
as
set
forth
in
the
first
clause
of
1961(4),
by
definition--
mr.
marc
fernich
--and
that
is
not
an
absurd
result.
it
is
a
--
and
it
is
a
result
that
squares
with
the
primary
purpose
of
the
statute
as
enacted,
which
was
to
prevent
the
subversion
and
infiltration
of
legitimate
business
by
criminal
elements.
mr.
marc
fernich
to
be
sure,
your
honor,
we're
only
calling
--
and
the
problem
only
arises
in
the
context
of
an
association-in-fact
enterprise.
the
great
weight
of
authority
and
--
and
the
plain
language
of
1961(4)
does
not
define
an
individual
as
an
association-in-fact
enterprise.
and
it
does
not
square
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
to
call
an
individual
an
association-in-fact
enterprise.
and,
moreover,
doing
so
would
create
a
whole
set
of
other
problems,
distinctness
problems.
mr.
marc
fernich
a
legal
enterprise.
mr.
marc
fernich
we
don't
--
we
don't
press
that
contention,
your
honor.
we
specifically
press
it
for
the
phrase
"any
union
or
group
of
individuals
associated
in
fact,
although
not
a
legal
entity.
"
the
"individual"
portion
appears
in
the
first
clause
of
the
statute.
the
distinctness
problem
simply
does
not
arise
in
the
context
of
a
legal-entity
enterprise.
and
it's
important
to
note,
as
this
court
said
in
salinas
--
recognized
in
salinas
--
virtually
every
criminal
prosecution
that's
brought
under
1962(c)
is
brought
against
an
illicit
association-in-fact
enterprise.
the
--
the
scenario
of
an
individual
being
an
associationin-fact
enterprise
--
i
don't
think
it's
a
valid
association-in-fact
enterprise
as
a
matter
of
law.
there's
a
line
of
cases
from
the
seventh
circuit
that
says
it's
not.
and
this
structural
problem,
having
a
structure
that's
distinct
from
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activities
so
that
the
two
elements,
i
should
say,
are
kept
separate
and
apart,
only
arises
in
the
context
of
an
association-in-fact
enterprise,
which
is,
of
course
--
is
a
very,
very
wide
swath--
mr.
marc
fernich
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
marc
fernich
oh,
well,
certainly
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
the
proposition
of
street
gangs,
and
many
of
them
are
cited
in
our
briefs.
the
--
a
great
preponderance
of
--
of
typical
rico
prosecutions
are
hierarchical,
drug-type
street
gangs
which
have
regimented
structures.
and
again,
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question,
we
don't
contend
that
that's
a
strict
necessity,
but
certainly
they
are
not
going
to
have
a
problem
establishing
a
structured
enterprise
with
a
regimented
drug
gang.
mr.
marc
fernich
well,
your
honor--
mr.
marc
fernich
--we
contend
that
they
must
be
charged
that
there
has
to
be
a
structure
separate
from
the
commission
of
the
predicate
acts
themselves.
the
seventh
and
eighth
circuits
use
pattern
jury
instructions
that
give
that
precise
charge.
and
there
has
been,
to
my
knowledge,
no
reported
difficulties--
mr.
marc
fernich
--it
means
--
and
--
and
i
would
take
the
test
most
prominently
from
your
honor's
own
home
circuit,
as
--
as
spelled
out
in
the
riccobene
case:
a
--
an
ongoing
decisional-making
apparatus
to
guide
the
affairs
of
the
enterprise,
a
directional
mechanism.
the
third
circuit
in
riccobene
said
an
overseeing,
clearinghouse
and
coordination
function,
and
--
and
a
cohesive
existence
between
predicate
acts.
mr.
marc
fernich
the
gang
has
no
structure
aside
from
that
which
is
a
necessary
incident
to
the
commission
of
each
racketeering
act.
we
don't
contend
there
has
to
be
a
formal
organization,
but
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
continuing,
ongoing
organization
other
than
that
when
they
get
together
to
commit
the
predicate
crimes.
mr.
marc
fernich
there's
no
evidence
of
that
in
the
record
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
fernich
your
honor,
the
testimony
about
the
brooklyn
social
club
is
--
is
a
little
bit
overdrawn,
i
would
say.
and
i
would
direct
the
court
to
pages
58
and
74
through
75
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
this
is
the
testimony
of
witness
gerard
bellafiore,
whose
testimony,
by
the
way,
is
the
only
testimony
we
know
for
a
fact
that
the
jury
credited.
quote:
just
a
club
to
hang
out
in,
not
for
any
type
of
anything.
so--
mr.
marc
fernich
--yes.
that
--
that's
true.
but
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
they
would
do
anything
other
than,
for
example
--
and
this
is
not
in
the
record
--
for
example,
shoot
pool
at
the
club.
and
--
and
bellafiore
himself
was
careful
to
qualify
it
in
that
way
so
that
he
wasn't
gilding
the
lily.
mr.
marc
fernich
it
sounds
to
me
like
a
jury
could
--
if
they're
having
regular
friday
meetings
and
they're
using
sophisticated
means
to
canvas
the
rico
statute
with
a
degree
of
--
of
complexity
and
sophistication
to
figure
out
what
they're
going
to
do
or
maybe
even
try
to
evade
the
statute,
it
probably--
mr.
marc
fernich
--if
a
jury--
mr.
marc
fernich
--if
a
jury
were
properly
instructed
that
there
had
to
be
a
structure
separate
and
apart
from
just
that
which
is
inherent
in
the
commission
of
each
act,
a
properly
instructed
jury
probably
could
well
find
the
requirements
satisfied
on
--
on
the
hypothetical
that
your
honor
has
posited.
the
cases
say,
the
cases
out
of
the
seventh
circuit,
say
it
is
not
a
high
hurdle.
they
say
it's
a
low
hurdle,
and
there
has
to
be
some
structure,
but
not
much
--
not
much
--
to
distinguish--
mr.
marc
fernich
--the
ongoing
existence,
the
regular
meetings,
and
the
degree
of
sophistication
employed.
and
it
--
it
implies
that
they're
not
just
sort
of
getting
together
on
an
impromptu
basis
as
opportunities
arise,
but
they're
sitting
around
on
a
regular
basis
for
a
--
a
continuing
period
of
time
and
planning
things
out.
what
are
we
going
to
do
this
weekend?
what
are
we
going
to
do
next
weekend?
let's
twist
the
hypothetical
a
little
bit.
maybe
they
project
out
3
or
4
weeks
ahead
of
time.
that's
what
rico
is
--
is
getting
after,
some
kind
of
sophistication,
some
kind
of
coordination.
this
is
the
crux
of
the
statute.
mr.
marc
fernich
mangiavillano,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
fernich
your
honor,
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
that
--
again,
what
was
found
by
the
jury
here.
the
testimony
is
that
mangiavillano
and
boyle
and
bellafiore
never
committed
any
crimes
together.
it's
--
it's
very
extensively
briefed
in
--
in
the
lower
court.
the
second
circuit
never
addressed
it.
there's
a
long
multiple-conspiracies
argument.
i'm
not
going
to
get
into
that
in
this
court.
the
fact
is
that
mangiavillano
had
nothing
to
do,
nothing
to
do
with
the
bank
burglaries
found
in
this
case.
there
were
three
burglaries
found
as
rico
--
i
shouldn't
say
burglaries--
mr.
marc
fernich
--okay.
mr.
marc
fernich
it
may
have
at
that
point,
but
there
was
no
evidence
--
and
--
and
because
it's
outside
of
the
time
frame
of
what
the
jury
has
found,
there's
a
lot
more
diversity
in
the
criminality
that
was
alleged
during
that
period.
a
properly
instructed
jury
may
have
found
that
there
was
an
enterprise
existing
at
that
time,
although
i'm
not
even
sure
a
jury
could
so
find
under
turkette
because
the
--
the
core
of
the
membership
changed
very
dramatically
over
a
period
of
time.
but
the
leadership
would
be
one
--
to
be
sure,
leadership
is
something
that
a
jury
could
take
into
account
and
could
permissibly
find
if
they
were
properly
instructed.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
can't
answer
that
question
definitively.
mr.
marc
fernich
certainly
the
defense
would
take
a
ruling
like
that,
but--
mr.
marc
fernich
--a
structure
--
the
structure,
i
don't
think,
entails
necessarily
rules,
regulations,
et
cetera.
i
don't
think
the
word
"structure"--
mr.
marc
fernich
--is
your
honor's
question
is
that
a
sensible
definition
of
"structure"?
mr.
marc
fernich
yes,
it
is
a
sensible
definition
of
"structure".
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
marc
fernich
thank
you,
your
honor.
very
briefly,
nobody
disputes
the
proposition
that
a
properly
instructed
jury
would
be
able
to
find
that
racketeering
acts
committed
by
an
individual
is
a
distinct
element
from
the
association-in-fact
enterprise.
the
government
is
absolutely
right,
and
we
agree
on
that
score.
the
problem
is
the
lower
courts
have
misread
turkette.
they're
not
focusing
on
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
committed
by
the
individual.
they've
--
and
the
instruction,
as
justice
kennedy
himself
quoted
in
this
case,
encapsulate
it
--
encapsulates
the
problem.
common
--
and
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
ja
1111.
common
sense
suggests
that
the
existence
of
an
associationin-fact
is
oftentimes
more
readily
proven
by
what
it
does
--
it
does
--
not
rather
than
what
an
individual
member
does,
rather
than
by
abstract
analysis
of
its
structure.
so
it
only
raises
a
further
vagueness
problem.
we
agree
that
patterns
of
racketeering
activity
are
properly
committed
by
individuals.
if
you
are
going
to
define
the
enterprise
solely
or
principally
by
virtue
of
the
pattern,
whose
pattern
would
you
define
it
by?
it
doesn't
even
make
any
sense.
and
in
turkette,
it
--
with
respect
to
what
occurred
in
turkette
--
and
this
is
at
page
5
of
my
brief.
the
latter
--
and
this
is
a
quote
from
turkette,
and
it's
referring
to
the
pattern.
the
latter
is
proved
by
evidence
of
the
requisite
number
of
acts
of
racketeering
committed
by
the
participants
in
the
enterprise.
we
agree
in
the
abstract
that
a
properly
instructed
jury
--
that
the
pattern
and
--
and
the
--
the
enterprise
are
totally
different
things.
the
problem
is
it's
a
giant
circular
argued
by
the
government.
juries
aren't
being
properly
instructed
in
that
regard,
and
that
only
compounds
the
vagueness
of
the
statute.
a
second
point
i
would
like
to
make.
the
government
presses
its
principal
definition
of
an
enterprise
in
its
brief,
and
what
i
hear
here
from
the
government
is
its
common
purpose.
common
purpose.
and
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court
to
the
salinas
opinion
which
discussed
rico
conspiracy.
it's
at
522
u.s.
--
well,
i
will
give
you
the
--
let's
try
118
s.
court
477,
it
looks
like.
common
purpose
is
the
hallmark
of
a
conspiracy.
and
this
is
in
the
discussion
of
a
conspiracy.
we
rejected
argument
x
because
it
would
erode
the
common
law
principle
that
so
long
as
they
share
a
common
purpose,
conspirators
are
liable
for
the
acts
of
their
co-conspirators,
which
is
the
pinkerton
doctrine
which
collapses
1962(c)
into
a
general
conspiracy
statute,
if
you
are
going
to
define
an
enterprise
principally
by
virtue
of
its
common
purpose.
that's
my
second
point.
as
far
as
the
--
the
claim
that
somehow
we
didn't
object
sufficiently
to
the
charge,
i'm
not
going
to
address
that
in
any
depth.
i
would
just
direct
the
court
to
pages
97
through
109
of
the
joint
appendix.
it
--
it
spells
out
exactly
what
we
objected
to,
and
we
objected
to
virtually
every
sentence
of
the
instruction
that
defines
or
purports
to
define
an
association-in-fact
enterprise.
as
far
as
the
definition
of
the
enterprise,
we
would
certainly
agree
with
justice
breyer's
formulation
that
something
to
differentiate
it
as
a
long-term,
goal-directed,
decision-making
apparatus
that
continues
in
the
intervals
between
the
predicate
acts
would
do
it.
but
we
contend
that
structure
is
largely
--
it's
a
plain
english
word.
it's
not
antidisestablishmentarianism
or
something
like
that.
the
jury
should
be
instructed,
as
in
the
seventh
and
eighth
circuits,
that
there's
got
to
be
a
structure
separate
from
the
pattern.
if
the
jury
has
questions,
we
have
lots
of
faith
in
district
judges,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out;
that
if
the
jury
comes
back
with
a
question,
the
judge
could
list
examples
tailored
to
the
appropriate
case.
and
i
just
want
to
hit
at
the
common
--
the
purpose
underlying
rico
here.
it's
very
significant
in
my
view
that
bank
burglaries
are
not,
in
fact,
rico
predicate
acts,
and
if
you
were
to
look
--
if
this
court
were
to
look
at
my
--
my
court
of
appeals
briefs
in
this
case,
bank
burglary
is
not
a
rico
predicate
act
for
a
reason.
congress
made
a
judgment
that
bank
burglaries
are
adequately
handled
by
the
states,
that
the
states
can
prosecute
them.
and
the
reason
why
these
three
bank
burglaries
had
to
be
dressed
up
as
interstate
transportations
of
stolen
money
is
because
this
is
not
really
a
case
in
which
rico
is
properly
invoked.
it's
fully
briefed
in
my
court
of
appeals
submission.
these
are
state
crimes
that
a
state
is
perfectly
capable
--
capable
of
handling
on
its
own.
and
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
would
waive
any
further
rebuttal.
