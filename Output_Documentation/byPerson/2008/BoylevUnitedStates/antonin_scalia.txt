what
--
what
do
you
mean
by
that
precisely?
suppose
you
have
a
group
of
--
of
people.
the
ringleader
goes
and
gets
a
safecracker,
he
gets
a
wheelman,
and
so
forth,
all
the
people
he
needs
for
the
crime.
and
he
says,
we're
going
to
call
this
the
--
the
brinks
job
group.
okay?
we
are
the
brinks
job
group.
but
that's
the
only
thing
that
he
has
put
the
group
together
in
order
to
do.
but
it's
still
a
group.
he
calls
it
a
group,
and
he
gets
all
these
guys
together
and
they
--
they
meet
and
have
lunch
together,
and
do
a
lot
of
stuff
together.
would
that
meet
your
--
your
condition
of
a
separate
association
from
the
predicate
acts?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
insofar
as
it's
directed
to
the
brinks
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
do
you
need
a
hierarchy?
why
do
you
need
a
--
why
can't
it
be
a
democratic
mob?
i
mean,
there's
no
boss
and
they
agree
that
all
of
their
decisions
will
be
taken
unanimously.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
what
you
requested.
isn't
--
isn't
that
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--instruction
you
requested?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
i
assume
that
--
that
he
was
responding
to
the
argument
that
you
can
establish
the
enterprise
from
the
mere
existence
of
the
pattern
of
the
acts,
of
the
separate
acts.
and
if,
indeed,
it
takes
nothing
more
than
the
acts
to
constitute
the
enterprise,
it
seems
to
me
he
has
a
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
so
we'll
forget
about
your
first
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
appendix?
not
--
not
the
joint
appendix.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
were
--
were
they
shown
to
the
jury,
all
of
those
bank
burglaries?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case
whether
--
whether
the
entity
can
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--derived
simply
from
the
predicate
acts.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
yang,
i
am
--
i
am
really
confused
now.
i
don't
--
i
am
not
sure
i
know
what
your
answer
to
the
question
presented
is,
which
is
quite
simply,
must
an
association-in-fact
enterprise
under
rico
have
some
ascertainable
structure
beyond
that
inherent
in
the
commission
of
predicate
crimes
by
its
members
and
associates?
and
you
--
your
answer
is
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
you
can
tell
the
jury
--
you
would
have
to
tell
the
jury
you
have
to
find
it.
of
course,
the
jury
can
find
it,
but
the
issue
is,
must
the
jury
be
told
that
it
has
to
find
it?
i
think
he's
conceding--
justice
antonin
scalia
--be
told
it's
not
enough,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
for
you
to
find
that
these
predicate
acts
occurred.
you
must
find
--
and
--
and
you
can
find
it
just
from
the
predicate
acts,
if
you
think
the
evidence
will
--
will
justify
that.
you
must
find
an
organization
separate
from
the
mere
commission
of
the
predicate
acts.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
