justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
you
--
you
imported
--
i'm
looking
at
your
quotation
from
--
from
turkette,
on
page
5
of
your
brief.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
conclusive
of
your
point.
in
order
to
answer
justice
scalia,
you
had
to
interpolate
to
add
various
words.
you
had
to
say
--
you
said
an
ongoing
organization
with
directions
or
something
to
that
effect.
that's
not
what
turkette
says.
turkette
says,
as
proven
by
evidence
of
an
ongoing
organization,
formal
or
informal,
that's
continuing.
that's
all
it
says.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
you've
described
this
--
this
gang.
one
--
one
person
is
a
guard.
the
other
person
brings
the
hook
to
pull
the
--
the
box
off.
another
person
scouts
it
out.
another
person
has
got
the
scanner.
it
seems
to
me
to
fit
precisely
what
you've
just
described.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
it
pretty
clear
that
if
the
--
the
person
who's
supposed
to
be
the
lookout
doesn't
perform
his
job,
he's
not
going
to
be
included
in
that
next
heist?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
--
you
would
instruct
the
jury
that
if
these
three
thefts
that
are
covered
by
rico
occurred
over
a
period
of
a
year,
and
they
involved
lookouts
and
scanners
and
so
forth,
you
may
infer
from
these
acts
an
enterprise
as
defined
by
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
would
allow
that
instruction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where
--
where
in
your
briefs
or
in
the
materials
do
we
find
the
definition
of
what
the
enterprise
is,
other
than
in
the
statute,
other
than
the
terms
of
the
statute
itself?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
what
--
what
do
i
refer
to
in
order
to
supplement
the
instruction
that
i
just
noted
--
that
i
just
suggested?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
at
the
bottom
of
111
where
he
said
that
you
can
look
to
see
what
it
does
and
make
the
inference
rather
than
have
--
i
forget
--
an
abstract
analysis?
