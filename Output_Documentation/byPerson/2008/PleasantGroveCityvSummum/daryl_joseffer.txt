mr.
daryl
joseffer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
of
course
the
government
can
select
the
content
and
viewpoint
of
monuments
on
the
national
mall
and
in
other
public
parks
across
the
country.
the
vietnam
veterans
memorial
did
not
open
us
up
to
a
viet
cong
memorial.
when
the
martin
luther
king
memorial
is
completed
on
the
mall,
it
will
not
have
to
be
offset
by
a
monument
to
the
man
who
shot
dr.
king.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
well,
if
--
when
it
is
government
speech
--
for
example,
we
can
have
a
--
a
washington
monument
and
a
jefferson
memorial
without
an
adams
one.
i
mean,
we
do
get
to
decide
who
we
want
to
memorialize
on
the
mall
because
it's
government
speech.
but
there
are
also
--
there
are
two
legal
theories
here.
the
first
is
that
this
is
government
speech.
the
second
is
that
this
--
even
if
it
was
private
speech,
this
would
be
one
of
those
unusual
contexts
like
public
broadcasting,
museums,
libraries,
where
normal
forum
principles
do
not
apply
because
the
government
is
acting
as
a
curator
and
value
judgments
are,
therefore,
both
inevitable
and
appropriate.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i
mean,
if
we
wanted--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--yes.
when
the
--
when
the
government
is
speaking,
it
can
choose
who
to
memorialize
and
who
not--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--yes,
the
government
can
choose
to
memorialize
who
it
wants
on
the
mall.
when
the
government
is
--
now,
to
be
clear,
that's
under
the
free
speech
clause.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
the
only
question--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--well,
as
a
matter
of
the
free
speech
clause,
there
are
no
limits
on
the
government's
ability
to
speak
freely.
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
establishment
clause,
perhaps
the
due
process
clause,
there
might
be
thought
to
be
independent
checks
on
the
government's
speech.
but
the
free
speech
clause,
whatever
else
it
does,
does
not
prevent
the
government
from
speaking
freely.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
the
government
would
be
powerless
to
do
anything
if
it
cannot
first
formulate
and
then
express
its
own
viewpoints.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
when
the
--
when
the
government
--
and
this
is
a
point
i
started
on
earlier.
when
the
government
is
acting
as
a
curator
as
in
the
museum
context,
normal
forum
principles
do
not
apply.
in
forbes,
for
example,
this
court
held
that
when
the
government
acts
as
a
public
broadcaster
it
normally
can
engage
in
viewpoint
discrimination
outside
of
an
exception
for
candidate
debates.
and
the
--
and
the
same
point
applies
here
to
monuments,
i
think,
for
a
combination
of
three
reasons.
first,
the
government
has
an
overwhelming
interest
as
a
property
owner
in
not
being
saddled
with
structures
it
does
not
want;
second,
the
limits
on
the
availability
of
public
space
you
refer
to;
and,
third,
the
government's
sovereign
interest
in
using
monuments
on
its
own
property
to
tell
its
own
story,
as
the
federal
government
has
done
here
on
the
mall.
it's
similar
to,
for
example,
a
sculpture
garden
or
--
and
--
a
sculpture
garden
where
the
government
can
choose
what
sculptures
to
put
in
the
sculpture
garden
without
necessarily
having
some
overriding
theme
or
overriding
reason.
if
i
could
give
two
examples
of
that,
in
meridian
hill
park
here
in
northwest
d.c.,
between
15th
and
16th
streets,
the
government
chose
to
accept
and
place
a
variety
of
privately
donated
structures
that
have
no
evident
connection
to
one
another.
they
cover
people
as
diverse
as
joan
of
arc,
president
buchanan--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--right.
as
a
matter
of
policy--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--the
free
speech
clause
on
its
own
force
does
not
prevent
the
government
from
speaking
freely.
but
as
a
matter
of
rational
basis
review
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
government
would
have
a
legitimate
governmental
interest
in
pure
partisan
activity.
but
the
free
speech
clause,
what
it
does
is
that
it
--
it
limits
the
extent
to
which
the
government
can
regulate
other
people's
speech.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
if
it's
government
speech,
though--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--but
when
the
government
is
speaking
or
when
the
government
is
acting
as
a
curator
as
with
a
museum
or
a
sculpture
garden
or
a
library
or
here,
the
government
is
absolutely
entitled
to
make
both
content
and
viewpoint-based
distinctions.
otherwise,
you
get
the
absurd
result--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--right.
if
we
--
if
we
couldn't
formulate
and
express
viewpoints,
i
would
be
here
today
in
support
of
neither
party.
and
the
government,
frankly,
would
be
prevented
from
doing
much
of
anything.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
yes.
now,
yes
--
i
mean
--
yes,
if
it's
just
the
simple
point
that
we
can
do
content
and
viewpoint
discrimination
in
this
context.
and
forbes
recognized
that
when
the
government
--
even
if
it's
private
speech,
forbes
recognizes
that
as
a
curator
we
can
do
this.
an
example,
though,
of
the
question--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--of
course,
the
court
could
put
limits
on
its
holding
if
it
so
desired.
but
if
i
could
address
the,
sort
of
the
hybrid
speech
which
seems
to
worry
some
people.
the
vietnam
veterans
memorial
is
a
great
example.
people
are
permitted
there
to
put
private
objects
next
to
the
wall.
that's
clearly
authorized
speech.
it's
authorized
public
speech.
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
government
comes
around,
takes
it
away,
puts
the
nonperishable
objects
in
a
government
warehouse,
and
then
decides
which
of
them
to
display
in
the
smithsonian's
american
history
museum.
so
what
starts
off
as
public
speech
--
or
as
private
speech,
clearly
becomes
government
speech
when
the
government
assumes
control
over
it.
it's
the
same
as
the
government
putting
a
painting--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--in
a
government
museum.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
but
if
the
government
--
take
a
museum.
the
government
could
choose
or
not
choose
to
put,
say,
a
gilbert
stuart
painting
that
has
a
favorable
portrayal
of
a
former
president
on
display.
the
government
didn't
paint
it.
it
has
gilbert
stuart's
name
all
over
it.
but
when
the
government
chooses
to
put
that
in
a
--
in
a
display,
it's
the
government
that
is
speaking,
and
the
government,
therefore,
has
an
absolute
right
to
decide
its
own
speech.
that
should
become--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--yes.
and
when
we
are
talking
about
physical
objects
that
constitute
the
speech,
that's
oftentimes
the
case
in
museums,
sculpture
gardens,
parks
across
the
country.
so,
frankly,
there
is
--
there
is
nothing
even
unusual
about
it.
and
the
reason
is
that
all
the
free
speech
clause
does--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--it's
simply
that
once
the
government
is
speaking,
it
is
the
one
--
it
turns
on
control,
right?
so
once
the
government
takes
control
of
something,
says
this
is
our
speech,
then
it's
the
government
speaking.
and
here,
i
mean,
it
does--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--and
frankly,
public
parks
are
no
less
absurd,
because
we've
been
doing
it
in
public
parks
for
probably
at
least
as
long
as
well.
and
in
fact,
there
are
thousands
of
privately
donated
monuments
and
sculptures
in
public
parks
across
the
country,
and
i
suspect
a
great
many
of
them
don't
have
some
formal
disclaimer
on
them
saying
"i
am
the
united
states
and
i
approve
this
message.
"
that's
not
the
way
that
government
speech
has
ever
been
thought
to
work.
the
question,
though,
with
government
speech
turning
on
control,
this
is
the
easy
case
because
we
have
a
physical
object
that
government
has
both
legal
and
physical
custody
over.
it
chooses
to
display
it,
and
then
it
can
do
whatever
it
wants
with
it.
it
can
move
it,
modify
it,
destroy
it,
drop
it
to
the
bottom
of
the
ocean,
sell
it
on
e
b
ay.
so
you'll
never
get
a
better
example
of
control,
which
this
court
held
in
johanns
is
the
touchstone
for
government
speech
that's
not
subject
to
the
free
speech
clause.
thank
you.
