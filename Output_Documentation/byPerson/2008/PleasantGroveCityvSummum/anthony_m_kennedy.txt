justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
because
i
think
it's
critical,
critical
to
your
argument.
as
a
procedural
matter,
i
thought
that
the
establishment
clause
issue
was
raised
in
the
initial
complaint.
are
you
taking
the
position
it's
now
waived
or
something?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
was
under
the
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
prevail,
the
action
should
be
dismissed,
as
far
as
you're
concerned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
getting
back
to
the
chief
justice's
point,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
if
you
say
it's
government
speech
that
in
later
cases,
including
the
case
of
the
existing
monument,
you're
going
to
say
it's
government
speech
and
you
have
an
establishment
clause
problem.
i
don't
know
if
--
i'm
not
saying
it
would
necessarily
be
resolved
one
way
or
the
other,
but
it
certainly
raises--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--an
establishment
clause
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--did
the
nea
--
finley
v.
nea,
the
court
didn't
treat
that
as
government
speech.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
am
i
--
is
that
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but,
justice
stevens's
question
is
important,
maybe
not
for
your
case
but
for
other
cases.
we
are
deciding
this
for
other
cases
to
arise,
and
why
isn't
he
correct
that
if
you
don't
like
the
message
then
that
raises
a
content-based
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
have
to
make
the
government
speech
argument
for
you
to
make
the
argument
that
you
just
made.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
same
question
justice
stevens
had,
just
to
tack
onto
his
question
here,
your
answer
was:
oh,
well,
the
government
owns
it.
suppose
the
government
says:
we
will
accept
ownership
only
if
we
agree
with
the
message.
that
just
puts
his
question.
i
think
the
ownership
argument
is
--
is
not
an
answer
to
the
justice's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
the
equal
protection
clause
would
--
if
you
wrote
an
equal
protection
clause
opinion,
you
would
end
up
saying
it's
content-based.
that's
the
first
amendment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
don't
think
that
can
you
avoid
the
hard
part
by
saying,
oh,
other
amendments
of
the
constitution
might
apply.
the
heart
of
the
question
is
whether
the
government
may
discriminate
based
on
content,
and
that's
a
first
amendment
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
law
always
require
us
to
adopt
an
all-or-nothing
position?
aren't
there
some
extreme
cases
indicated
by
the
hypothetical
where
the
first
amendment
does
enter
in?
do
we
have
to
decide
this
case
that
it's
all
or
nothing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
are
time,
place,
and
manner
regulations,
with
which
we
are
all
familiar.
but
my
concern
is
that
this
--
this
case
is
an
example
of
the
tyrannies
--
of
the
tyranny
of
labels.
because
it's
a
public
forum,
as
justice
scalia
indicated,
for
parades,
for
protests,
which
are
limited
temporally,
it
--
it
--
it
just
seems
wooden
and
rigid
to
say
to
all
of
a
sudden
say,
well,
it's
a
public
forum
for
something
that
will
last
30
years
for
which
there
is
only
limited
space.
it
just
doesn't
make
common
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
saying
the
last
generation
had
much
more
freedom
than
the
present
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
your
--
you
can
stick
with
it
as
long
as
you
want;
that's
what
the
--
the
tenth
circuit
did,
but
suppose
that
we
were
to
say
that
we
were
unconvinced
by
the
comparison
between
speeches
and
parades
on
the
one
hand
and
monuments
on
the
other,
so
we
did
not
apply
the
public
forum
analogy.
would
that
be
the
end
of
your
case?
