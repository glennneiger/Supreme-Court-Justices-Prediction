justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
sekulow,
can
i
just
ask:
at
what
point
in
the
litigation
did
you
first
raise
the
government
speech
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
tough
--
isn't
the
tough
issue
here
not
so
much
whether
there
is
government
speech.
i
will
assume
and
i
do
indeed
assume
that
there
is.
isn't
the
tough
issue
here
the
claim
that
there
is
--
is
in
fact
a
mixture,
that
it
is
both
government
and
private.
and
the
argument
for
its
continuing
to
be
private
speech
i
take
it
is
simply
the
eagles
identification
with
the
presentation
and
their
espousal
of
what
the
monument
says.
how
--
how
do
you
think
we
ought
to
deal
with
the
mixture
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
probably
are,
but
most
of
them
--
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
here.
but
i
don't
suppose
that
most
of
them
--
most
of
them
contain
as
part
of
--
in
a
prominent
place
in
the
monument
itself
contain
the
statement
that,
you
know,
this
is
the
gift
of
or
the
position
of
or
what-not
of
x,
y
or
z,
whereas
this
monument
does.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
may
have
more
cases
coming.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
tell
me,
what
is
the
criterion
that
we
should
use
to
decide
what
the
significance
of
the
private
identification
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it
does,
it
changes
it,
as
i
understand
your
answer,
by
eliminating
the
private
aspect
of
the
speech.
so
that
your
real
answer
to
me
is
it's
not
a
mixture.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
there
ceases
to
be
a
mixture
the
moment
the
government
accepts
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
city,
in
effect,
if
the
city
says,
we
are
going
to
have
a
designated
ten-acre
field
in
which
anybody
can
put
up
a
monument,
but
you
can't
because
we
don't
like
your
message,
there's
a
first
amendment
problem.
but
if
the
city
hides
the
ball
in
effect
and
says
in
effect,
we'll
--
we'll
let
monuments
be
placed
on
--
we
will
accept
monuments
from
people
who
want
to
place
them
on
our
property
if
the
monuments
have
some
kind
of
an
arguable
historical
connection
or
a
connection
with
people
with
long
association
with
the
community,
as
long
as
they
have
that
sort
of
criterion
in
mind
then
they
can
select
any
way
they
want
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
nothing
could
be
a
more
obvious
control
of
the
message
than
the
criterion
that
says
we
will
decide
in
--
in
determining
to
accept
it
or
not,
we
will
decide
on
the
basis
of
whether
we
agree
with
the
message.
that
is
control
with
a
vengeance.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
--
they
do
in
the
example
justice
kennedy
just
raised
and
the
example
that
i
just
raised.
the
eagles
come
along
say:
here's
the
monument;
take
it;
it's
all
yours.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
--
the
government
says:
okay,
we'll
take
the
eagles
monument.
we
will
not
on
identical
terms
take
the
summum
monument
because
we
disagree
with
the
message.
at
the
point
they
make
the
decision
they
don't
own
anything.
what
they
are
doing
is
controlling,
in
your
words,
and
they
are
controlling
on
the
basis
of
agreement
with
the
message.
why
isn't
that
a
first
amendment
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we've
got
--
we've
got
to
shut
our
eyes
to
the
period
prior
to
the
moment
title
passes.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
that
mean
if
we
engage
in
viewpoint
discrimination
for
three
decades,
we
are
home
free?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
wouldn't
be
a
speaker
on
your
view
until
it
takes
control
of
the
monument.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
those
are
cases
in
which,
to
begin
with,
the
government
is
engaging
in
--
a
process
of,
in
effect,
sponsoring
speech.
and
here
we
--
we
have
not,
i
think,
reached
the
point
in
which
the
public
park
is
to
be
analogized
either
with
a
publication
or
a
magazine
or
--
or
grants
to
--
to
the
arts.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
answer
to
justice
alito's
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would
be
--
the
trouble--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
see
your
point,
but
the
trouble
with
that
as
an
argument
here
is
the
private
part
of
the
speech
is
just
as
much
chiseled
in
stone
as
the
public
part.
so
it's
not
going
to
go
away
at
the
end
of
the
day,
and
there
isn't
any
way
that
the
government
in
effect
can
engage
in
the
gesture
of
saying
all
private
speech
is
treated
the
same
way,
whatever
way
that
might
be.
so
we've
got
a
--
we've
got
a
--
we've
got
a
more
difficult
problem
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
you
are,
in
effect,
saying
--
and
this
may
be
--
i
don't
mean
i
think
this
is
necessarily
the
wrong
answer
--
but
you're,
in
effect,
saying,
yes,
you
can
find
instances
of
government
speech
in
which
there
is
clearly
a
--
a
private
identification
consistent
with
it,
but
the
only
appropriate
analysis
is
the
analysis
for
government
speech.
you
can't
have
it
both
ways,
you've
got
to
pick
one
or
the
other;
and
it
is
--
it
is
the
government
aspect
which
controls
the
first
amendment
purposes.
that,
i
take
it,
is
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
it,
but
we
haven't
had
this
kind
of
a
challenge
before.
so,
i
--
i
guess
it
still
rests
on
you
to
say
why
should
we
submerge
the
private
part
to
the
government
part.
there
may
be
a
very
good
reason,
but
i
want
to
know
what
your
reason
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
they
do
that?
what
is
the
--
you
mentioned
that
frequently
in
your
brief,
and
i'm
not
sure
what
formality
you
have
in
mind
when
you
say
adopt.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
this
case
--
your
claim
would
disappear
if
this
town
in
utah
had
passed
an
ordinance
saying
we
adopt
the
ten
commandments
monument?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
--
i
mean,
if
that's
all
that's
involved
here,
we're
engaging
in
kind
of
a
--
almost
a
silly
exercise
in
formality.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
tell
them
you
have
got
to
take
the
monument
down
if
they
don't
do
it,
don't
you
think
they
are
going
to
pass
that
pretty
quick?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
--
it
that
is
so,
what
is
the
point
of
using
the
public
forum
analysis
at
all?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
--
that
may
mean
that
you
have
the
foundation
for
a
--
a
speech
discrimination
argument--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
that
would
not
be
the
answer
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
--
a
traditional
public
forum
in
--
in
the
sense
that
the
court's
cases
have
used
the
term.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
seems
to
me
that
your
use
of
public
forum
is
just
by
kind
of
remote
analogy
here,
and
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
helping
you
or
would
help
us
if
we
used
it
as
criterion
for
decision.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
have
to
do
that,
say,
for
time
place
and
manner
restrictions
for
access
to
a
public
forum
if
it
really
is
a
public
forum.
there
is
something
more
involved
here.
this
is
closer
to
the
case
of
the
individual
who
says
sure,
put
the
mccain
sign
on
--
on
my
lawn.
no
one
is
going
to
doubt
that
the
person
whose
house
is
there
is
in
favor
of
mccain;
and
--
and
it
seems
to
me
we
are
in
the
same
situation
with
the
monument
in
the
city.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
when
you
get
the
monument--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we
do
not
--
there
is
no
pervasive
understanding
or
non-pervasive
one,
i
would
have
thought,
in
the
united
states
that
anyone
who
wants
to
display
a
message
in
granite
in
a
public
park
can
put
it
there.
no
one
assumes
that.
everyone
assumes
that,
if
the
granite
monument
is
there,
the
city
or
whatever
has
said,
yes,
we
approve
it,
put
it
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
create
the
first
amendment
problem,
but
it
seems
to
me,
going
back
to
justice
alito's
question,
that
the
city's
decision
is
a
clear
adoption
of
the
monument.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
even
on
your
own
criterion,
if
the
city
passes
a
resolution
saying
we
adopt
this,
you're
still
--
you're
going
to
be
faced
with
precisely
the
content
discrimination
problem
that
you're
arguing
about
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
basically
just
arguing
for
a
clear
statement
rule.
i
mean,
justice
alito's
question,
my
analogies
are
suggestive
of
the
fact
that
there
is
an
affirmative
government
act
of
some
indication
of
approval
when
it
says,
yes,
you
can
put
the
monument
here.
and
what
you're
arguing
for
is,
well,
we
want
a
clearer
statement,
we
want
it
to
say,
yes,
we
really
adopt
it,
it's
ours
from
the
heart.
and
that
seems
to
be
the
difference
between
your
position
and
the
--
and
the
position
that
acceptance
of
the
monument
is
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
can--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
can
make
that
distinction.
there's
no
--
i
understand
the
distinction
you're
making,
but
because
i
don't
see
that
that's
a
distinction
that
a
reasonable
member
of
the
public
would
understand
to
be
implied
by
the
--
or
at
least
to
be
--
to
be
raised
by
the
placement
of
the
monument,
i
don't
know
why
it's
a
distinction
that
should
be
significant
for
first
amendment
purposes.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
want
a
signing
statement
as
well
as
a
signature?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
not
disclaiming
it
here.
the
government
isn't
disclaiming
it.
and
the
difference
it
seems
to
me
between
you
and
your
friends
on
the
other
side
is
you
want
this
clear
statement.
you
want
a
statement
--
for
example
if
you
took
justice
scalia's
statement,
that
would
satisfy
you,
and
it
would
also
be
the
poison
pill
in
the
establishment
clause.
isn't
that
what's
--
i
mean,
that's
okay
with
me.
i
don't
see
that
as
an
illegitimate
object.
i
was
a
van
orden
dissenter
--
i
mean,
but
isn't
that
what
is
driving
this?
