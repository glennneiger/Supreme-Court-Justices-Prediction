chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
07-665,
pleasant
grove
city
v.
summum.
mr.
sekulow.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
sekulow,
you're
really
just
picking
your
poison,
aren't
you?
i
mean,
the
more
you
say
that
the
monument
is
government
speech
to
get
out
of
the
first,
free
speech
--
the
free
speech
clause,
the
more
it
seems
to
me
you're
walking
into
a
trap
under
the
establishment
clause.
if
it's
government
speech,
it
may
not
present
a
free
speech
problem,
but
what
is
the
government
doing
speaking
--
supporting
the
ten
commandments?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
sekulow--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--when
you
come
upon
this,
if
somebody
comes
upon
this
monument
in
the
park,
how
are
they
supposed
to
tell
whether
it's
government
speech
or
private
speech?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
sekulow.
mr.
joseffer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
harris.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
far
do
you
push
that?
i
mean,
what
about
the
hypotheticals
on
the
other
side?
i
mean,
you
have
a
statue
of
liberty;
do
we
have
to
have
a
statue
of
despotism?
or
do
we
have
to
put
any
president
who
wants
to
be
on
mount
rushmore?
how
do
you
answer
those?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
it's
frozen
into
time.
everything
up
until
now
is
okay,
but
anything
going
forward
is
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
said
the
government
can
accept
what's
there
and
say
that's
our
speech.
but
you're
challenging
the
ability
to
do
that
going
forward.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it
does
all
the
time.
the
--
you
don't
get
equal
time
--
the
cigarette
companies
don't
get
equal
time
because
the
government
says
the
surgeon
general
has
determined
it
is
bad
for
your
health.
it
always
suppresses
alternative
viewpoints.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
depend
on
--
given
the
focus
on
public
perception,
does
it
depend
on
the
content
of
the
speech?
in
other
words,
if
you
came
across
a
monument
and
it
said,
"the
eagles
are
a
lot
better
than
every
other
organization,
you
should
give
money
to
the
eagles.
"
someone
is
going
to
walk
by
that
and
say,
"well,
that's
probably
not
the
city,
that's
probably
the
eagles.
"
but
the
eagles,
you
know,
for
all
the
good
they
do,
did
not
come
up
with
the
ten
commandments,
and
somebody
is
going
to
look
at
that
and
say,
"that's
probably
the
city".
they
are
not
going
to
look
at
that
and
immediately
say,
"that's
what
the
eagles
believe".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
sekulow,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-665,
pleasant
grove
city
versus
summum.
