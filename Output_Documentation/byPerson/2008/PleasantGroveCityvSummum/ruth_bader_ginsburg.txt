before
we
get
--
before
we
get
away
from
the
government,
the
establishment
clause,
you
said,
well,
van
orden
answered
that,
but
did
it?
because
you
don't
have
here
a
40-year
history
of
this
monument
being
there,
and
nobody
seems
to
be
troubled
by
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
context
of
all
other
lawgivers.
this
is
a
stand-alone
ten
commandments
and
you
don't
see,
i
don't
think,
anywhere
"i
am
the
lord
thy
god.
"
that's
not
shown.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
that
--
if
we
accept
that
there
is
government
speech,
i
think
justice
souter's
question
is
isn't
this
really
the
government
endorsement
of
the
eagles'
message?
i
mean,
the
eagles
are
all
over
this
monument,
their
symbol
of
the
eagle,
and
the
eagles
want
it
to
be
known
that
this
is
their
monument.
indeed,
i
think
in
van
orden
wasn't
the
--
in
the
district
court
there,
wasn't
the
statement,
well,
this
--
texas
did
this
in
recognition
of
the
good
work
that
the
eagles
do
in
preventing
--
help
try
to
prevent
juvenile
delinquency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
go
back
to
--
your
basic
premise
is
this
is
a
public
forum,
in
any
and
all
instances;
and
we
do
have,
certainly
in
the
speech
area,
demonstration
area,
from
time
immemorial
public
parks
have
been
places
where
people
can
speak
their
minds.
but
i
don't
know
of
any
tradition
that
says
people
can
come
to
the
park
with
monuments
and
put
them
up
if
they
will,
so
long
as
they
meet
the
equivalent
of
time,
place
and
manner.
so
you're
making
an
assumption
that
from
time
immemorial,
monuments,
just
like
speeches,
can
be
presented
by
anyone
who
wants
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
taking
this
line
because
you
say
if
the
city
council
votes
for
it,
then
the
voters
can
know
those
people
voted
to
put
up
the
ten
commandments;
we
don't
like
that;
so
we
are
going
to
vote
them
out?
is
that
--
what
underlies
this
notion
that
it
isn't
good
enough
for
them
to
approve
the
placement
of
the
monument,
but
it
has
to
be
some
kind
of
formal
declaration?
