justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
it
depends
on
what
the
government
speech
consists
of,
what
it
is
the
government
is
saying
about
the
ten
commandments.
if
the
government
is
saying
the
ten
commandments
are
the
word
of
god
that's
one
thing,
and
if
the
government
is
saying
the
ten
commandments
are
an
important
part
of
our
national
heritage,
that's
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
38
is
the
cut-off
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
a
challenge
to
the
ten
commandments
monument?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
this
case
did
not
involve
an
establishment
clause
challenge.
why
are
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
goes
to
the
same
thing,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
whether
it's
the
government
stating
the
message
or
whether
it's
the
government
creating
a
limited
public
forum
for
the
presentation
of
only
those
messages
that
it
thinks
are
important,
it
comes
to
the
same
thing,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
the
government
could
disfavor
homosexuality
just
as
it
could
disfavor
abortion,
just
as
it
can
disfavor
a
number
of
other
things
that
in
--
in
many
states
people
are
free
to
do.
the
government
can
disfavor
all
of
it,
can't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
only
absolutely
entitled,
it
has
to
do
so.
it
--
it
has
no
choice,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
run
a
museum
if
you
have
to
accept
everything,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
they
can't
do
it
in
museums,
either.
i
mean,
yes,
we've
been
doing
this
for
a
couple
of
hundred
years,
but
maybe
we've
been
wrong
all
along
and
maybe
the
government
can't
run
museums.
it's
possible,
right?
it's
a
brave
new
world.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
in
a
public
forum.
i
mean,
that
sort
of
begs
the
question.
i
mean,
that
--
that
encapulates
your
--
your
--
encapsulates
your
answer.
has
the
--
has
the
city
allowed
anybody
to
put
up
a
monument
there
willy-nilly?
i
mean,
a
public
forum,
as
you
know,
we
can
have
praise
in
the
park,
we
can
have
protest.
anybody
can
do
it,
so
long
as
you
get
a
license
and
you're
not
interfering
with
some
other
group.
that's
a
public
forum.
has
this
city
said
anybody
can
put
up
a
monument
in
this
park?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
public
forum
for
some
things.
is
it
a
public
forum
for
everything?
it
may
be
a
public
forum
for
processions,
for
parades.
but
it
is
a
public
--
is
it
a
public
forum
for
anybody
constructing
a
monument?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
other
side
says
that
some
of
these
monuments,
especially
in
the
civil
war
battlegrounds,
do
indeed
show
who
the
donors
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
mr.
sekulow
says
that
some
of
these
monuments,
notably
those
in
the
civil
war
battlefields,
do
show
who
the
donors
are.
now
is
that
government
speech
or
private
speech?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
have
to
go?
justice
antonin
scalia
now
that
the
government
converted
them,
it
passes
a
law
saying,
what,
we
--
we
adopt
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
enough
that
the
government
accepts
ownership
of
it
and
places
it
on
the
government's
property?
isn't
that
a
manifestation
of
the
government's
adoption
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
adopting
one
version.
if
it's
adopting
the
version
by
saying
these
ten
commandments
are
the
word
of
god,
that's
one
thing.
if
it's
adopting
it
by
just
saying
this
is
a
version
of
the
ten
commandments
that
has
had
a
very
significant
place
in
the
history
of
the
american
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
care
what
version
it
was
if
that's
all
they're
doing.
justice
antonin
scalia
nor
would
the
mormons
in
utah,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
harris,
we
--
we
need
a
clear
rule
here.
we
--
we
can't
expect
the
courts
or
the
cities
for
that
matter
to
investigate
in
every
case
what
the
degree
of
the
government's
involvement
in
the
--
and
what
is
the
degree,
50
percent,
45
percent,
36
years?
i
mean,
we
are
going
to
make
up
a
percentage?
that's
--
that's
not
the
way
threshold
constitutional
questions
ought
to
be
resolved
or
resolvable.
we
need
a
clear
rule
that
the
cities
can
rely
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
an
historical
basis
for
that,
or
you
just
made
it
up?
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea?
i
mean,
if
that
had
been
the
practice
over
the
past
200
years
for
all
of
these
monuments
that
--
that,
you
know,
are
strewed
across
the
landscape,
then
i'd
say
yes,
that's
probably
what
the
difference
is.
but
i'm
not
aware
that
there
is
any
such
--
such
requirement
and
any
such
practice
on
the
part
of
government.
you're
--
you're
creating
a
new
world.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be
a
very
nice
world
but
it
happens
not
to
be
the
world
under
which
our
constitution
has
subjected
this
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
all
right,
the
first
95
monuments,
whoever
--
whoever
put
them
up,
okay?
it's
a
monument
to
chocolate
chip
cookies
or
whatever
else,
is
that
it?
first
95?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
practical
solution
to
the
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
will
say
just
the
opposite
when
you
come
back
here
to
challenge
the
ten
commandments
monument
on
--
on
establishment
clause
grounds.
you
will
say
something
like
this:
anybody
who
comes
into
this
park
and
seeing
this
monument
owned
by
the
government,
on
government
land,
will
think
that
the
government
is
endorsing
this
message.
that's
what
you
will
say
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
why
would
it
be
true
there,
but
it's
not
true
here?
would
anybody
think
that
on
public
land
owned
by
the
government
the
government
disagrees
with
this
message?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
resolution
of
adoption
by
the
city
council
just
says,
"the
city
council
agrees
that
this
monument
of
the
eagle
association
expresses
an
idea
worthy
of
the
public's
attention.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it's
just
a
statue
of
george
washington?
what
kind
of
a
resolution
does
the
city
council
adopt?
"we
endorse
everything
george
washington
ever
said?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
right,
and
i
think
they
would
adopt
a
resolution
that
says,
"we
think
george
washington
is
worthy
of
respect
and
emulation
on
the
part
of
our
citizens.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
could
say
that,
why
couldn't
it
say
the
same
thing
about
the
ten
commandments?
"we
think
the
ten
commandments
are
worthy
of
respect
and.
"
--and
i
wouldn't
say
"emulation";
i
would
say
"respect
and
reverence
by
our
citizens.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
acquired
the
memorial.
the
city
has
acquired
property
in
this
memorial
and
has
agreed
for
this
memorial
to
be
placed
in
the
city
park.
period.
"we
believe
that
the
ten
commandments
which
are
embodied
in
this
memorial
are
worthy
of
respect
by
the
citizens
of
pleasant
grove.
"
--is
that
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
you
keep
saying
it,
and
i
don't
know
what
it
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
have
thought
adopting
what
i
said
shows
that
it
is
adopting
the
content
of
the
monument
insofar
as
the
monument
says
the
ten
commandments
should
be
respected
by
the
citizens
of
pleasant
grove.
is
that
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
it
has
to
say,
"we
believe
in
the
ten
commandments?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
that's
fairly
implied
by
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
there
in
pleasant
grove's
park
and
that
pleasant
grove
city
council
has
allowed
it
to
be
constructed
there?
don't
you
think
that's
implicit?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
city
doesn't
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--know
what
you
mean
by
"we
adopt",
just
as
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
"we
adopt".
