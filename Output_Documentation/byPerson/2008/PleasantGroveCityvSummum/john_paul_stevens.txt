justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
question
that's
kind
of
in
the
background
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
you
didn't
have
the
policy
that
you
do
have,
but
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
city
decided
not
to
put
up
this
monument
because
it
disagreed
with
the
message
of
the
monument.
whether
you
call
it
government
speech
or
private
speech,
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
position.
it
would
have
been
permissible
for
the
city
to
say,
our
park
it
filled
with
monuments
and
we
are
only
going
to
let
those
in
who
convey
messages
that
we
agree
with?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
a
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
really,
in
this
case
sort
of
the
debate
as
to
whether
the
policy
justifications
for
the
monument
are
a
sham
are
not
are
really
irrelevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it's
a
government
forum
for
private
speech,
i
think
it's
the
same
thing.
you're
defining
--
you
define
the
forum
to
include
only
those
--
the
forum
is
putting
up
monuments.
you
just
put
up
those
monuments
that
agree
with
the
message.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
the
government
in
the
vietnam
memorial
decided
not
to
put
up
the
names
of
any
homosexual
soldiers.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
get
the
answer.
did
you--
