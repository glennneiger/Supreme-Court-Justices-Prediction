justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
seems
to
be
the
problem
here.
and
what
i
have
in
this
is
the
--
the
problem
i
have
is
that
we
seem
to
be
applying
these
subcategories
in
a
very
absolute
way.
why
can't
we
call
this
what
it
is
--
it's
a
mixture
of
private
speech
with
government
decisionmaking
--
and
ask
the
question,
as
we
do
in
election
cases,
is
the
restriction
proportionate
to
a
legitimate
objective?
i
know
how
you're
going
to
answer
that
question.
you're
going
to
say:
of
course,
it
is.
but
what's
interesting
me
is,
are
we
bound
in
these
cases
to
apply
what
i
think
of
as
an
artificial
kind
of
conceptual
framework
or
are
we
free
to
ask
what
seems
to
me
to
be
at
the
heart
of
the
matter?
the
answer
to
justice
stevens's
hypothetically
is:
of
course
the
government
can't
do
that
because
it's
disproportionate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
the
answer
to
the
--
what
is
the
answer
to
justice
stevens's
hypothetical?
what
is
the
answer
to
the
homosexual
hypothetical?
what
is
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
that
tests
the
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
they
only
accept
democrats
who
are
sculptors,
and
they
reject
all
the
republicans?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
in
the
first
amendment
--
are
you
saying
the
first
amendment
would
not
stop
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
we
do
--
is
this
monument
suspiciously
similar
to
the
one
in
texas?
and
so
if
the
history
is
the
same,
you
would
know
that
there
was
--
a
big
element
of
this
was
cecile
b.
demille
trying
to
promote
his
movie,
the
ten
commandments.
so
he
gave
money
to
the
eagles,
and
the
eagles
put
ten
commandments
all
over
because
it
would
be
good
for
the
morality
of
people,
and
also
it
would
help
promote
the
movie.
all
right?
is
that
true
--
is
that
the
actual
description
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
so
if
that's
the
history
of
it,
what
does
that
mean?
i
mean,
where
do
we
go
with
that?
then
this
is
in
fact
partly
an
attempt
to
promote
morality,
partly
an
attempt
to
be
civic,
partly
an
attempt
to
promote
a
movie.
so,
what
do
we
do
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
why
--
suppose
that
there
--
there
are
certain
messages
that
private
people
had
like
"eat
vitamins"--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
so
they
say
--
you
know,
whatever
those
are;
and
then
somebody
comes
along
with
a
totally
different
content,
"ride
the
roller
coaster",
and
they
say
this
part
of
the
park
is
designed
to
get
healthy
children,
not
put
children
at
risk.
so
therefore
we
like
messages
to
eat
vitamins,
and
we
don't
want
messages,
"ride
the
roller
coaster".
this
is
all
private.
it's
the
--
you
know
--
now
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
other
words,
they
--
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
can't
do
either.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
case
that
says
--
can
they
have
playgrounds
in
the
park?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
we
have
right
in
the
playground,
we
have
"eat
vitamins",
"eat
your
--
clean
up
all
your
--
all
the
food
in
your
plate.
"
"don't
throw
food
at
your
brother.
"
okay?
so
--
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
all
private.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
there
are
various
groups
that
feel
that's
important;
the
city
says
yes,
it
is;
and
we
don't
want
things
like
pull
the
dog's
tail,
or
----
[laughter]
--whatever.
so
--
so
what's
wrong
with
that?
where
does
the
first
amendment
forbid
that?
you
promote
--
they
want
in
this
corner,
promoting
in
the
playground
good
things
that
they
like
and
not
bad
ones.
where
does
it
permit
it?
what's
the
case
that
says
that
the
government
couldn't
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
give
one
and
i'll
read
it.
give
me
three;
i'll
read
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
children's
playground
isn't
the
public
forum.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
where
you're
going.
thank
you.
