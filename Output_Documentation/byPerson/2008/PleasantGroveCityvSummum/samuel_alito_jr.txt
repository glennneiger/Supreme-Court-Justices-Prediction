justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can't
there
be
a
situation
where
the
government
does
create
a
monument
that
is
a
--
a
limited
public
forum?
let's
take
the
example
that
you
just
gave,
the
vietnam
war
memorial.
i
presume
the
government
could
not
refuse
to
have
the
names
of
certain
deceased
soldiers
on
that
monument
because
it
disagreed
with
certain
ideas
that
they
had
espoused
at
one
point
or
another.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
that
the
answer
to
the
--
the
question?
why
isn't
the
answer
to
the
question
that
monuments
generally
are
not
--
the
erection
of
monuments
generally
are
not
a
forum?
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
the
speaker's
corner
in
the
park
where
anybody
can
speak
and
a
permanent
monument
that
takes
up
space,
presumably
limited
public
space.
and
if
you
have
the
unusual
situation
where
you
are
have
a
monument
that
is
really
analogous
to
a
forum,
then
the
forum
analysis
would
be
applicable.
but
to
apply
it
to
something
like
the
washington
monument
or
the
jefferson
memorial
is
ridiculous.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
give
you
this
example.
just
by
chance
yesterday
i
was
taking
a
walk
in
a
little
neighborhood
park,
and
i
saw
that
there
was
a
monument
--
a
small
monument,
donated,
and
it
says
right
on
there
donated
by
a
private
neighborhood
association
to
commemorate
a
number
of
people
who
were
killed
in
the
9-11
attack
on
the
pentagon.
and
now
if
i
searched
the
town
records
or
the
county
record
and
i
don't
find
any
resolution
saying
they
adopted
this
monument
as
their
monument,
does
that
mean
that
if
i
would
like
to
put
up
a
monument
in
the
park
to
commemorate
loved
ones
who
died,
or
people
who
i
respect,
i
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well
what
if
the
situation
is
a
neighborhood
association
prepared
this;
they
said
we'd
like
to
display
it
in
the
park;
and
the
county
or
the
town
says
fine,
go
ahead
and
do
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
merely
allowing
the
monument
to
be
built
on
public
property
sufficient
acceptance?
if
somebody
came
up
to
you
and
said
i'd
like
to
put
up
a
monument
in
your
front
yard,
and
you
said
sure
go
ahead,
do
that,
aren't
you
accepting
that
--
whatever
the
monument
says,
in
a
sense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
when
government
adopts
it,
can
it
at
that
time
specify
what
it
understands
the
statement
to
be?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
tenth
circuit.
petitioner,
pleasant
grove
city,
owns
and
displays
a
number
of
monuments
and
other
objects
in
pioneer
park,
utah
including
a
ten
commandments
monument.
in
2003,
respondent,
summum,
a
religious
group
asked
the
city
to
erect
a
stone
monument
displaying
its
seven
aphorisms.
the
petitioner
denied
the
request.
in
2005,
the
respondent
sued
the
city
and
various
officials
arguing
that
because
the
city
had
accepted
the
ten
commandments
monument
to
free
speech
--
speech
clause
of
the
first
amendment
compels
the
city
to
display
the
seven
aphorisms
monument
as
well.
the
district
court
denied
respondent's
request
for
a
preliminary
injunction
ordering
the
city
to
erect
respondent's
monument.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
held
that
the
city
was
required
to
accept
the
monument
because
of
public
park
is
a
traditional
public
forum.
we
conclude
that
although
a
park
is
a
traditional
public
forum
for
speeches
and
other
transitory
expressive
acts,
the
display
of
a
permanent
monument
in
a
public
park
is
not
a
form
of
expression
to
which
form
analysis
supplies,
instead,
the
placement
of
a
permanent
monument
in
a
public
park
is
best
viewed
as
a
form
of
government
speech
and
is
therefore
not
subject
to
scrutiny
under
the
free
speech
clause.
for
this
reason
and
other
set
out
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit.
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
