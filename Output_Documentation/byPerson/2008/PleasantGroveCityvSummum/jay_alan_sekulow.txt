mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
tenth
circuit
erred
when
it
held
that
the
first
amendment
free
speech
clause
forces
pleasant
grove
city
to
accept
and
erect
on
its
property
a
private
party's
donated,
unattended,
permanent
monument.
the
decision
suffers
from
two
constitutional
defects:
first,
the
court's
conclusion
that
a
donated
ten
commandments
monument
constitutes
private
speech
rather
than
government
speech
is
wrong.
here
each
of
the
monuments
on
display
in
pioneer
park
have
been
selected
by
the
government,
are
owned
by
the
government,
controlled
by
the
government,
and
are
displayed
on
government
property.
when
the
government
is
speaking,
it
is
free
from
the
traditional
free
speech
constraints
of
the
first
amendment.
second,
the
court
compounded
its
error
by
further
concluding
that
pioneer
park
is
a
traditional
public
forum
for
the
erection
of
permanent,
unattended
monuments
by
private
parties.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
the
ten
commandments
here
was
displayed
in
pioneer
park,
as
the
mayor
said,
mayor
cook,
in
1971,
to
show
the
pioneer
heritage
of
the
community.
this
was
a
community
of
pioneers
on
a
quest
for
religious
liberty.
that's
why
this
town
was
established.
there
is
no
establishment
clause
claim,
mr.
chief
justice,
here.
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
relief
that
the
respondents
are
really
seeking.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
and
i
think
that
--
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
there
was
no
federal
establishment
clause
complaint
at
all.
there
was
a
state--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--it
was
under
the
state
of
utah's
establishment
clause.
it
was
raised
in
the
complaint.
it
was
not
the
basis
upon
which
the
injunction
was
sought,
and
the
tenth
circuit
noted
that
it
was
waived.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
yes.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
just
let
me--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well,
i
think
from
an--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--if
there
was
an
establishment
clause
claim,
justice
kennedy,
which
is
not
here,
van
orden
forecloses
it.
this
monument
is
very
similar
to
what
was
at
play
in
van
orden.
and
here
the
city
stated
the
reason
that
they
accepted
and
erected
this
monument,
accepted
the
donation
from
the
fraternal
order
of
eagles,
was
to
show
something
and
to
represent
their
pioneer
heritage,
but--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that's
--
and
precisely,
justice
scalia,
that's
exactly
what
mayor
cook
in
fact,
at
the
unveiling
ceremony,
stated
that
this
will
serve
to
remind
citizens
of
their
pioneer
heritage
and
the
founding
of--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--their
community--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--right.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
no.
you're
correct.
those
were
speech
selection
cases.
it
think
it
clearly
--
that
the
actions
here
of
the
government,
of
the
city
council,
falls
neatly
within
forbes,
finley,
and
the
plurality
in
american
library
association.
the
government--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--there
is
a
36-year
history
here.
this
monument
has
been
on
display
since
1971.
so
this
monument
has
been
there
a
long
time,
and--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--is
that
the
cut-off?
[laughter]
perhaps
i
miscounted.
it
may
be
38.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
of
course
the
face
of
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
states
on
the
face
of
the
monument
that
it's
presented
to
pleasant
grove
city
in
utah
county
by
the
fraternal
order
of
eagles.
as
far
as
a
government
speech
as
far
as
ownership
and
control
goes
under
a
johanns
analysis,
different
from
finley
and
forbes
and
that
context,
here
the
government
exercised
control.
after
all,
they
allowed
it,
accepted
it,
and
allowed
it
to
be
erected
on
their
property.
under
utah
law,
all
right,
title,
and
interest
to
that
property
transferred.
but
i
would
say
with
regard
to
the
endorsement,
if
you
will,
or
the
establishment
clause
issue,
really
the
context
here,
as
this
court
has
consistently
stated
within
the
establishment
clause
cases
matter
--
this
court
has
a
depiction
of
moses
holding
the
ten
commandment
in
the
frieze
of
the
courtroom
with
the
words
written
in
hebrew.
that's
not
an
endorsement
of
the
religion
or
of
the
commandments.
it's
representative
of
the
history.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
no,
the
words
on
the
court's
frieze
are
"steal",
"murder",
"adultery"
in
hebrew.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
very
different
in
that
context.
but
as
far
as
the
actual
language
of
what's
going
on
within
the
park
itself,
justice
ginsburg,
this
is
not
a
monument
standing
alone.
there
are
15
other
displays
in
this
pioneer
park.
it's
called--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--it's
not.
this
is
not
an
establishment
clause
case.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
there
is
no
establishment
clause.
it's
not
a
basis
upon
which
the
injunction
was
sought,
and
the
tenth
circuit
specifically
held
it
was
waived.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
at
the
tenth
circuit.
the
tenth
circuit,
the
existing
law
in
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
summum
line
of
cases
mandated
a
private
speech
determination,
even
if
the
speech
was
controlled
or
known
by
the
government,
if
it
originated
with
a
third
party.
as
soon
as
we
were
before
--
and
under
tenth
circuit
rules
that's
binding,
of
course,
on
the
district
court
and
on
the
panel.
but
even
in
the
panel
brief,
we
raise
the
issue
of
government
speech
and
the
court
addressed
it
both
as
to
--
and,
justice
kennedy,
going
back
to
your
point
--
both
as
to
government
speech
and
to
the
speech
selection
cases
of
forbes,
finley,
and
american
library
association.
and
i
think
that
those
cases
as
well
point
to
what's
at
issue
here.
governments
in
the
business
of
governing
and
determining
the
parks
and
the
landscape
of
the
parks
make
these
kind
of
decisions.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
i
think
the
fact
that
it
originated,
that
the
monument
originated
by
the
eagles
as
a
third
party,
doesn't
in
any
way
take
away
from
the
fact
that
in
this
particular
case,
and
in
most
cases
involving
donated
monuments,
which,
as
the
united
states
would
point
to,
most
of
the
monuments
in
parks
are
donated
by
or
originated
with
third
parties--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--most
of
them,
justice
souter,
do
actually
have
statements.
in
fact,
a
perfect
example
would
be
at
gettysburg
national
military
park
a
number
of
those
monuments,
most
of
them,
are
donated
by
or
originated
by
third
parties.
they'll
often
say
"donated
by",
for
instance,
"the
father
corby"--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
hope
not.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
the
key
should
be,
as
this
court
alluded
to
in
johanns,
the
issue
of
control,
who
controls
the
message
ultimately
here.
and
the
fact
is
the
statue
of
liberty
originated
by
the
franco-american
union
--
was
originated
by
a
third
party.
the
united
states
by
resolution
accepted
it.
at
that
point
title
transfer.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
right.
and
i
think
that
actually
points
to
why
that
once
it's
controlled
and
owned
by
the
government
the
fact
that
it
originated
in
the
third
party,
justice
ginsburg,
changes
the
equation
for
ownership
and
control
to
the
government.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
it's
not.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
once
--
right,
title,
and
interest
vest
under
utah
law
in
the
pleasant
grove
city
upon
acceptance
and
at
that
point
it
is
owned
and
controlled
by
the
city.
and
the
fact
that
it
was
originally
created
--
and
justice
ginsburg,
you're
correct,
the
district
court
and
also
the
court
of
appeals
in
van
orden
stated
that
it
was
originated
as
a
moral
guidance
for
youth.
that
was
the
reason
that
the
fraternal
order
of
eagles
developed.
the
state
of
texas
said:
we're
going
to
honor
the
eagles.
that
was
their
reason,
as
well
as
showing
the
role
of
the
ten
commandments
and
the
rule
of
law.
and
then
the
third
--
excuse
me,
justice
stevens.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
sure.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
it
wouldn't
be
a
first
amendment
free
speech
claim.
it
might
raise
an
establishment
clause,
an
equal
protection
kind
of
clause
analysis
case,
but
not
under
the
basis
upon
which
respondents
have
sought
here.
i
think
that's
important
to
point
out.
the
basis
upon
which
they
sought
access,
in
you
will,
is
a
species
of
an
equal
access
claim.
but
of
course
our
position
is
the
government
hasn't
established
anything
by
accepting
the
monument.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
because
if
the
government
is
speaking,
if
it's
the
government's
message,
they're
of
course
allowed
to
engage
in
content-based
statements.
the
statute
of
liberty
was
a
statement
of
liberty
enlightening
the
world.
i
could
give
a
list
of
monuments
that
do
that.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that's
what
they
did.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
no,
not
necessarily,
because
even
under
the
speech
selection
cases
--
i
mean,
that's
correct
--
governments
make
determinations
of
what
they
are
going
to
put
in
their
parks
to
communicate
a
message.
that's
very
different
from
a
situation
i
think
where
the
tenth
circuit
panel
was
incorrect
and
respondents
are
incorrect:
they
confuse
the
issue
of
the
government
actually
creating
a
forum
or
a
venue
for
speech
--
and
a
perfect
example
of
that
would
be
here,
with
ownership
and
control
vesting
in
the
city.
very
different
in
that
situation
than
the
typical
equal
access
case,
where
the
government
merely
opens
up
its
facilities
for
a
variety
of
viewpoints,
justice
stevens,
and
then
cannot
engage
in
content-based
or
viewpoint-based--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--justice
souter,
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
opening
up
a
forum,
taking
acres
of
a
park
and
saying
everybody
gets
to
go
in,
and
another
situation
where
the
government
is
clearly
controlling
it
not
for
a
subversive
reason.
and
i
think
the
evidence
in
these
cases,
in
these
series
of
cases,
pointing
to
justice
kennedy's
concern
about
what
does
it
mean
for
future
cases,
here
it
is
uncontroverted:
the
basis
upon
which
the
preliminary
injunction
ultimately
was
issued
by
the
tenth
circuit
disregarded
or
at
least
cast
doubt
on
the
declaration
of
the
park
administrator,
who
had
been
involved
in
city
government
since
1972,
who
stated
--
and
it
can
be
found
on
pages
102
through
104
of
the
joint
appendix
--
that
it's
been
the
practice
of
pleasant
grove
city
for
three
decades
to
accept
displays
only
in
their
particular
case
related
to
the
history
of
the
community,
its
pioneer
history.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
it
depends
on
--
if
it's
a
limited
public
forum,
certainly
limited
public
forums
can
be
based
on
subject
matter
and
speaker
identity.
this
court
said
that,
said
that
consistently,
cornelius
and
perry.
so
in
that
context,
and
now
that
limited
public
forum
appears
to
be
more
of
a
non-public
forum
type
of
analysis,
certainly.
even
in
the
designated
public
forum,
it
could
be
limited
in
that
regard.
i
think
that
points
to
the
confusion
of
what
took
place
here.
the
court
in
our
view
conflated
those
two
issues,
the
issue
of
forum
and
government
speech.
and
while
they're
both
separate
basis
upon
which
we
believe
the
tenth
circuit
opinion
could
be
reversed
and
vacate
the
issuance
of
the
injunction,
the
reality
is
that
in
this
particular
case
once
title
passed
and
control
vested
in
pleasant
grove
city
they
were
the
owner
and
effectively
controlled.
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
does
not
mean
that
they
violate
the
establishment
clause
simply
because
they
own
and
control
a
monument.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
if
the
policy
is--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--if
the
policy
is
that
we're
only
going
--
that
the
government's
controlling
those
messages,
it's
not
individual
private
expression,
of
course.
if
it's
individual
private
--
if
the
government,
on
the
other
hand,
were
to
say--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--from
a
legal
standpoint
on
government
speech,
it's
irrelevant.
on
the
factual--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--it's
not
ownership,
justice
kennedy,
in
and
of
itself.
ownership
is
an
indicator,
a
factor
for
control,
but
it
is
control
of
the
message.
when
the
government
implanted
that
monument
donated
by
the
fraternal
order
of
eagles,
they
were
sending
a
message.
it
was
not
a
message
of
"i
am
the
lord
thy
god--
"
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--the
difference
is
--
the
difference
between
each
of
those
cases
and
the
case
here
is
the
fraternal
order
of
eagles
surrendered
control
of
their
message
and
their
speech.
in
the
typical
equal
access
case,
justice
stevens,
they
do
not.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
which
happened
here.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
it's
not
a
first
amendment
violation
because
the
government
takes
ownership
and
control
at
the
time
it's
displayed,
and
there
is
no
dispute
at
the
time
it's
displayed
that
the
government
is
conveying
a
message.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
absolutely
not,
because
discovery
in
this
case
proves
the
fact
that
this
has
been
a
policy
in
existence
for
three
decades.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
under
that
analysis--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--if
the
government
is
the
speaker,
they
are
certainly
entitled
to
do
that.
if
they
are
not,
that
would
be
a
very
different
scenario.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
but
the
government
--
the
speech
selection
itself
is
an
independent
basis
under
forbes,
finley,
and
american
library
association
to
bring
these
kind
of--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think,
when
it
comes
to
the
issue
of
selecting
monuments
for
its
park,
it's
very
similar
to
a
museum
curator
or
the
arts.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
regard
to
the
hypothetical
about
the
senator
mccain
or
president-elect
obama
signs,
there
is
another
factor
that's
important
here;
and
that
is
those
signs
are
created
by
those
--
usually
by
the
campaigns.
so
the
fact
that
it's
created
by
a
third
party
doesn't
in
any
way
diminish
the
speech
aspect
of
an
individual
who
has
put
that
sign
in
their
home.
also
with
regard
to
the
adopt
the
monument,
governments
don't
adopt
monuments;
they
adopt
resolutions
that
accept
monuments.
that's
the
way
it
worked
here;
that's
the
way
it
works
in
most
municipalities.
that's
this
--
the
trigger
of
allowing
the
monument
to
be
displayed.
here
there
are
two.
the
city
--
it
was
approached
and
made
a
formal
acceptance,
and
it
was
noted
later
in
their
minutes
as
well,
so
in
two
different
places.
with
regard
to
the
adoption
of
the
speech
problem,
justice
alito,
under
the
hypothetical
or
--
not
hypothetical,
the
factual
situation
that
you
talk
about,
under
the
tenth
circuit's
theory,
the
case,
in
respondent's
theory
of
the
case,
al-qaeda
sympathizers
could
come
in
and
say
we
want
to
erect
a
monument
praising
the
value
of
the
terrorists,
and
unless
there's
a
compelling
governmental
interest,
there
would
be
no
basis
on
which
to
deny
it.
that's
why
the
whole
public
forum
analysis
on
this,
in
our
view
is
absolutely
incorrect.
and
finally
on
the
adopt
a
speech,
there
are
monuments
and
memorials
that
incorporate
a
variety
of
message,
including
holocaust
memorials,
and
they
will
often
have
in
place
nazi-era
propaganda,
the
signs
from
the
nazis
that
were
designed
to
draw
hatred
towards
jews;
and
they
will
incorporate
those
into
the
monuments
and
the
displays.
they
are
not
adopting
the
message
of
the
nazis;
they
are
showing
the
history
of
what
took
place
during
an
era.
that's
very,
very
different.
the
statute
of
liberty,
which
was
donated
to
the
united
states,
was
from
the
franco-american
union,
a
private
organization.
the
united
states
--
and
it's
found
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
--
specifically
accepted
the
monument,
authorized
the
president
to
accept
and
they
erected
the
pedestal.
all
privately
funded
in
that
regard,
and
it
was
originated
by
a
third
party.
the
government
was
speaking
when
they
erected
that
monument;
the
fact
that
the
antiquities
act
came
into
play,
which
just
means
you
cannot
harm
those
monuments,
it's
no
different
than
pioneer
park,
which
is
a
national
historic
treasure.
and
last
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
man,
is
the
reliance
on
pinette
is
misplaced
because
as
this
court
said,
pinette
is
an
establishment
clause
case,
and
the
reliance
here
by
the
respondent
has
been
on
the
free
speech
clause.
we
think
the
tenth
circuit
is
wrong,
both
under
the
government
speech
analysis
and
under
the
forum
approach,
and
for
that
reason
should
be
vacated.
thank
you.
