ms.
pamela
harris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
city
here
gave
the
eagles
access
to
its
public
park
for
s
display
about
the
ten
commandments
and
it
denied
summum
access
for
a
display
about
the
tenets
of
its
faith.
that's
a
violation
of
the
core
free
speech
principle
that
the
government
may
not
favor
one
message
over
another
in
a
public
forum.
the
eagles
display
here
is
not
government
speech.
the
city
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
ten
commandments
monument.
ms.
pamela
harris
justice
scalia,
there
is
a
very
serious
factual
question
in
this
case
about
whether
the
city
ever
had
a
bona
fide
selection
policy
for
this
park.
but
putting
that
to
one
side
for
a
moment,
a
public
park
is
a
public
forum.
a
monument
in
a
park
may
be
a
mode
of
communication
for
that
forum--
ms.
pamela
harris
--if
you
look
at
the
question
that
way,
justice
scalia,
it
might
be
said
that
a
public
park
is
not
a
forum
for
sound
trucks,
it's
not
a
forum
for
sleep-ins,
it's
not
a
forum
for
news
racks.
what
that
means
is
that
there
is
no
unfettered
right
to
engage
in
those
forms
of
communication.
but
if
the
government
allows
it
all--
ms.
pamela
harris
--and
that
is
exactly
why,
justice
kennedy,
the
city,
any
city,
is
permitted
to
make
a
decision
that
it
will
close
its
public
parks
to
all
unattended
displays.
the
court
said
that
in
pinette.
it
said
that
earlier
in
vincent.
but
because
there--
ms.
pamela
harris
--of
course
not,
is
how
i
answer
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
any
city
has
available
to
it
two
very
straightforward
options
for
dealing
with
this
question
if
by
some
happenstance
they
do
have
a
monument
on
public
land
that
is
not
now
a
government
monument.
the
first
thing
they
can
do
is
adopt
any
existing
monuments
as
government
speech,
convert
them.
ms.
pamela
harris
governments
can
do
it
different
ways,
justice
souter.
the
way
the
national
government
does
it
under
the
antiquities
act
of
1906
is
they
formally
designate
pre-existing
structures
as
a
monument
of
the
united
states
or
a
memorial
of
the
united
states.
and
that,
by
the
way,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
response
to
the
statue
of
liberty
problem.
in
1924
it
was
so
designated.
ms.
pamela
harris
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
ms.
pamela
harris
no.
no,
your
honor.
if
the
government
accepts
what's
there
--
what
is
there
now
and
says
that's
ours,
then
they
can
say
we
are
not
taking
--
we
have
closed
this
forum
to
private
speech,
these
parks
are
available
only
to
governmental
displays.
ms.
pamela
harris
i'm
sorry?
ms.
pamela
harris
it
depends
if
they
were
privately
formulated
and
handed
off
to
the
government
as
a
completed
object,
they
are
only
government
speech
if
the
government
has
since
then
converted
them--
ms.
pamela
harris
--by
adopting
them.
they
don't
have
to
go.
ms.
pamela
harris
that
has
happened.
ms.
pamela
harris
let
me
answer
both
of
your
questions,
justice
scalia.
the
way
it
does
that
even
if
they
--
even
if
a
monument
makes
clear
that
it
was
privately
formulated,
a
government
can
still
adopt
it
as
its
own
speech.
it
can
put--
ms.
pamela
harris
--it
would,
justice
souter.
we
would
no
longer
have
an
equal
access
right
going
forward--
ms.
pamela
harris
--absolutely
not,
justice
souter.
and
the
reason
we
know
it's
not
a
formality
is
because
the
city
here
refuses
to
do
it.
if
it
were
just
a
formality,
they
would
check
the
box.
they
won't
do
it--
ms.
pamela
harris
--i
don't
think
they
are,
justice
souter.
and
i
think
it
would
be
partly
a
concern
about
establishment
clause
exposure,
which
we
already
heard
about
today.
i
think
that
there
are
substantive
reasons
why
they
might
not
want
to
adopt
one
version
of
the
ten
commandments
as
the
city's
own
speech.
as
it
happens,
the
version
of
the
ten
commandments
on
the
eagles
monument
isn't
even
the
mormon
version
of
the
ten
commandments.
that
might
raise
sensitivities
in
this
town.
and
whenever
the
government
adopts
one
version
of
the
exodus
account,
that
is
not
legally
sensitive
but
politically
sensitive
as
well.
ms.
pamela
harris
i
think
that
those
are--
ms.
pamela
harris
--those
are
very
different--
ms.
pamela
harris
--well,
those
are
very
different
for
establishment
clause
purposes,
justice
scalia.
but
the
only
way
the
government
can
be
adopting
anything
in
this
context
is
by
saying
through
the
act
of
selection
we
have
adopted
it.
and
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the
government
is
not
allowed
to
select
which
private
speech
it
wishes
to
present
to
the
public
in
a
public
park.
it
can
do
that.
it
can
do
that
in
museums.
it
can
do
it
in
libraries.
it
can
do
it--
ms.
pamela
harris
--no,
your
honor,
and
really
for
three
separate
reasons.
first
of
the
all,
it
may
be
that
the
government
--
even
privately
donated
monuments
often
involve
a
great
deal
of
government
involvement
at
the
front
end,
when
they
are
created.
government
often
works
in
partnership
with
private
donors
to
create
the
content
of
that
monument.
ms.
pamela
harris
even
under
those
more
usual
circumstances
there
would
be
two
things
the
city
could
do
to
keep
you
out
of
their
park.
as
i
said,
they
could
adopt
the
monument
that
is
there.
the
other
thing
any
city
can
do
is
adopt
some
kind
of
a
content-neutral
ban,
or
a
content-neutral
limit,
on
the
number
of
private
displays
it
wants
to
have
in
its
park.
ms.
pamela
harris
i
agree
that
we
need
a
clear
rule,
and
if
clarity
is
important
here
the
easiest
way
for
the
government
to
make
clear
that
it
has
adopted
a
privately
formulated
message
as
its
own
is
to
adopt
it
clearly
and
publicly.
it
can
put
up
a
plaque;
it
can
designate
it
a
city
monument.
ms.
pamela
harris
i--
ms.
pamela
harris
--if
this
is
uncommon,
that
is
because
usually
the
government
does
reserve
monuments
for
governmental
speech,
monuments
that
it
helps
to
create
or
monuments
that
it
is
happy
to
endorse
after
the
fact.
if
this
case
is
unusual,
it's
because
pleasant
grove
has
done
an
unusual
thing
here
by
allowing
a
private
party
to
erect
a
permanent
monument
in
its
park,
even
though
it
is
not
willing
to
endorse
the
content
of
that
monument.
and
i
do
want
to
say
that
although
clear
rules
are
necessary,
whatever
the
particular
details
of
how
a
monument
came
to
be
on
public
land,
there
are
these
two
clear
safe
harbors
for
any
city
facing
that
problem.
adopt
it
now
or
enact
a
content-neutral
limit
on
the
number
of
monuments
in
the
park;
and
we
think
the
city
could
do
that
on
a
going-forward
basis.
it
could
say
we
have
room
--
for
aesthetic
reasons,
for
space
constraint
reasons,
we
would
like--
ms.
pamela
harris
--sure.
a
city
could
say
we
think--
ms.
pamela
harris
--absolutely,
because
any
city
confronting
this
problem
now
can
look
at
its
park
and
say
we
have
four
monuments--
ms.
pamela
harris
--i'm
saying
that
as
long
as
it
does
it
on
a
content-neutral
basis,
because
it
is
genuinely
concerned
about
aesthetics,
space
constraints,
clutter
in
its
parks,
a
city
can
enact
a
ban
or
a
limit
on
the
number
of
displays;
and
if
that
has
the
effect
of
grandfathering
in
existing
displays--
ms.
pamela
harris
--no,
justice
ginsburg.
monuments
are
different
from
speeches
and
because
monuments
are
different,
the
court
has
held
that
unlike
oratory,
a
city
can
decide
to
close
its
parks
entirely
to
all
private
unattended
displays.
it
could
not
say,
"we've
heard
enough
speeches;
no
more
speeches.
"
it
can
say
no
private--
ms.
pamela
harris
--because
here
the
city
has
not
done
that.
the
city
has
not
closed
--
it
has
not
made
the
decision
that
it
will
bar
all
private
unattended
displays.
ms.
pamela
harris
that--
ms.
pamela
harris
--oh,
i
think--
ms.
pamela
harris
--oh,
i
think
it
may
be
helpful,
justice
souter,
because
once
we
know
that
we
are
talking
about
a
public
forum,
we
know
that
access
cannot
be
limited
on
a
content
basis.
ms.
pamela
harris
oh,
no,
justice
kennedy.
even
outside
a
public
forum,
in
any
context
--
even
in
a
museum
or
library
--
in
any
context
in
which
the
government
is
regulating
private
speech,
it
may
not
act
in
a
way
that
is
designed
to
suppress
one
particularly
disfavored
message
or
view;
and
we
think
that's
what
happened
here.
as
i
said
earlier--
ms.
pamela
harris
--when
the
government
is
speaking
for
itself,
then
the
government
does
have
a
right
to
prefer
certain
viewpoints
over
others,
but
here
the
city
has
consistently
refused
to
adopt
the
content
of
this
monument
as
its
own,
and
it
is
still
disclaiming
endorsement
of
that
monument.
the
city
here
--
the
justification
for
that
government
speech
exception
is
that
sometimes,
as
the
united
states
has
said,
the
government
is
entitled
to
speak
in
its
own
voice
to
promote
its
own
messages,
its
own
policies.
but
it
says
it's
not
doing
that
here.
ms.
pamela
harris
um--
ms.
pamela
harris
--justice
scalia,
for
one
thing,
if
this
case
were
being
litigated
under
the
establishment
clause,
it
wouldn't
be
critical
whether
the
monument
were
actually
government
speech,
because
the
establishment
clause
can
be
implicated
by
the
government's
interaction
with
private
speech
as
well.
that
said,
i
do
not
think
it's
the
case
that
anybody
who
came
across
this
monument
would
know
that
the
government
is
speaking.
the
monument
says
it
is
presented
by
the
eagles.
it
has
the
eagles
emblem.
the
mayor
himself
testified
in
his
deposition
that
he
thought
the
monument
was
owned
by
the
city,
because
it's
the
eagles
and
not
the
--
i'm
sorry;
was
owned
by
the
eagles,
because
it
is
the
eagles
and
not
the
city
that
maintains
that
monument.
i
think
there
is
a
very
real
question
about
what
people
would
think
here
and
if
those
perceptions
are
important
the
easy
way
to
clarify
it
is
for
the
city
to
step
up
and
adopt
the
monument
as
government
speech,
which
it
won't
do
here.
ms.
pamela
harris
your
honor,
my
front
yard
is
different
from
a
public
park,
and
that
matters
because
when
all
the
government
has
done
is
said
sure,
go
ahead,
put
your
monument
in
our
park,
that's
all
the
government
ever
does
when
it
administers
access
to
a
public
forum.
if
it's
doing
it
on
a
content
basis,
that's
a
problem.
the
government--
ms.
pamela
harris
--again,
i
think
because
it's
a
public
park
and
because
public
forums
are
always
used
for
the
expression
of
--
of
ideas
that
the
government
does
not
necessarily
agree
with--
ms.
pamela
harris
--the
perceptions
will
not
be
clear.
ms.
pamela
harris
the
city
in
this
case
--
everybody
may
assume
that,
and
they
would
be
right.
the
city
in
this
case
did
say,
yes,
we
approve
that
monument
and
not
that
one.
so
you
can
put
yours
up,
and
you
can't.
that
doesn't
solve
the
first
amendment
problem.
that
is
the
first
amendment
problem
that
the
government--
ms.
pamela
harris
--if
all
we
have,
i
think,
justice
souter,
is
that
the
city
has
permitted
one
private
speaker
to
erect
a
monument,
there
is
no
constitutional
or
judicially
manageable
line
between
that
and
just
the
ordinary
thing
the
government
always
does
when
it
grants
preferred
access
to
a
public
forum,
which
is
to
say
you're
in,
you're
out.
if
that's
enough
for
adoption,
then
there
are
no
more
first
amendment
violations
through
lack
of
equal
access.
ms.
pamela
harris
but
because
it's
adopted
it
as
its
own
message,
then
we
think
the
government
is
speaking.
and
when
the
government
is
speaking,
as
the
united
states,
said
it
is
entitled
to
make
content
and
viewpoint
distinctions,
but
in
order
to
do
that,
it
has
to
step
up
and
speak
itself.
that's
the
justification
for
the
government
speech
doctrine.
ms.
pamela
harris
i
would
formulate
it
only
slightly
differently,
which
is
not
so
much
a
clear
statement
but
that
those
are
really
two
different
things,
approving
it
for
access
and
adopting
the
message
as
the
government's
own.
and
that
the
differences--
ms.
pamela
harris
--that
would--
ms.
pamela
harris
--if
what
matters
is
the
public
perception,
then,
yes,
we
do
think
that
to
clarify
an
unclear
situation
like
this,
where
have
you
a
monument
that
says
it's
presented
by
the
eagles,
it
has
the
eagles
emblem,
the
eagles
are
continuing
to
maintain
it
in
the
park,
and
that's
a
fact
we
should
assume
a
reasonable
observer
would
know,
then,
yes,
be
clear.
the
government
--
there's
one
way
to
clarify
that,
and
that's
for
the
government
to
adopt
it.
ms.
pamela
harris
i
think
it
can,
justice
alito.
it
can
adopt
--
now
the
government
is
speaking,
now
this
is
the
government's
own
message,
and
it
can
tailor
its
adoption
to
make
clear
what
message
it's
adopting.
and
in
answer
to
some
of
justice
scalia's
questions,
i
think
the
government
here
could
put
up
a
plaque
in
front
of
the
eagles'
monument
that
says
"monument
of
the
city
of
pleasant
grove
and
dedicated
to
the
role
that
the
ten
commandments
play
in
secular
law.
"
it
can
do
that.
ms.
pamela
harris
i
think
the--
ms.
pamela
harris
--no.
i
think
that
the
ordinance
--
or
the
ordinance
has
to
do
one
more
thing,
which
is
to
--
which
is
to
say,
"this
is
a
monument
of
the
city
of
pleasant
grove,
we
adopt
the
content
of
the
monument.
"
not
just
"we
approve
it".
"we
are
giving
it
preferential
access,
and
here
is
why.
"
ms.
pamela
harris
like
that.
ms.
pamela
harris
well,
i
think
it's
actually
trickier
than
that,
more
complicated
than
that,
your
honor.
again,
given
this
monument,
i
think
there
will
be
questions
about
whether
this
is
the
speech
of
the
eagles.
and
i
actually
think
that,
given
all
the
legal
sensitivities
around
a
ten
commandments
monument,
your
average
citizen,
when
they
see
a
religious
monument
in
a
park,
may
well
think
that
may
be
private
speech
because
the
government
usually
can't
endorse
or
at
least
sometimes
can't
endorse
religious
speech.
so
i
actually
think
these
questions
are
very
complicated.
and,
again,
if
you
want
to
be
clear
about
who's
speaking,
there's
an
easy
way
to
do
that,
which
is
for
the
government
straightforwardly
and
clearly
to
adopt
this
speech
as
its
own.
ms.
pamela
harris
no.
again,
and
in
my
answer
to
justice
alito,
they
can
adopt
any
resolution
they
want
so
long
as
they
adopt
that
statue
as
a--
ms.
pamela
harris
--city
memorial.
ms.
pamela
harris
and
so
long
as
that
is--
ms.
pamela
harris
--so
long
as--
ms.
pamela
harris
--so
long
as
it
is
preceded
by
a
statement
that
the
city
actually
adopts
the
memorial
as
its
own,
that
this
is--
ms.
pamela
harris
--a
pleasant
grove
memorial
or
a
pleasant
grove
monument.
ms.
pamela
harris
it
may
be
that
if
the
government
goes
on
long
enough,
it
will
have
connoted
what
is
very
important
here,
which
is
that
it
is
prepared
to
adopt
the
content
of
that
monument
as
its
own.
ms.
pamela
harris
it
means--
ms.
pamela
harris
--if
the
city
says--
ms.
pamela
harris
--no.
no.
i
understand
your
question,
justice
scalia.
if
the
city
says
what
you
just
said,
"we
are
adopting
this
monument
insofar.
"
and
however
it
wants
to
finish
that
sentence,
that
is
fine.
ms.
pamela
harris
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
i
think
that
all
that
implies
is
that
pleasant
grove
has
decided
this
speech
is
worthy
of
display
in
this
public
park
based
on
its
content.
and
that
is
the
decision
the
city
can't
make.
if
it
were
just
a
formality,
if
it
were
simple,
and
it's
all
the
same,
who
cares?
,
then
i
think
that
pleasant
grove
would
be
here
saying
something
different,
which
is,
"we
adopt.
"
"we'll
check
that
box.
"
there
are
substantive
reasons
why
it
doesn't
--
it
may
be
a
fine
line--
ms.
pamela
harris
--but
the
city
doesn't
want
to
cross
it.
ms.
pamela
harris
well,
whether
or
not
the
city
knows
what
we
mean,
what
we
know
from
the
city's
brief
is
that
what
it's
saying
is
--
and
this
is
on
page
33
of
its
brief
--
the
government
speech
here
is
only
in
the
act
of
selection.
selection.
it's
not
about
the
content
of
that
monument.
that's
not
enough
to
make
a
government
speech,
and
the
city
is
not
permitted
to
speak
through
selection,
and--
ms.
pamela
harris
--this
is
part
of
the
same
eagles
project--
ms.
pamela
harris
--that
was--
ms.
pamela
harris
--it's
all
a
private
message,
and
it
may
be
a
private
message
that
has
many
different
elements,
but
nothing
about
that
suggests
government
speech.
and
even
if
all
the
government
is
doing
in
its
public
part
is
promoting
one
version
of
the
cecile
demille
movie,
it
can't
do
that
on
a
content
basis.
ms.
pamela
harris
uh-huh.
ms.
pamela
harris
the
problem
is
that
it's
a
public
park,
and
content--
ms.
pamela
harris
--eating
vitamins
and
roller
coasters
are
not--
ms.
pamela
harris
--no.
ms.
pamela
harris
they
can
have
playgrounds,
yes.
ms.
pamela
harris
those
are
private
messages.
ms.
pamela
harris
uh-huh.
okay.
ms.
pamela
harris
it's
all
the
cases
that
say
the
government
can't
do
it.
ms.
pamela
harris
i'll
give
you
pinette.
the
government
can't
make
content
based
decisions
in
a
public
forum.
and
there
is
not
a
limit--
ms.
pamela
harris
--oh,
but
the
government
--
a
public
park
is
a
public
forum.
if
the
government
wants
to
set
aside
part
of
that
park
--
change
the
physical
characteristics,
change
the
principal
use
and
bear
the
attendant
cost,
it
can
definitely
do
that.
that
is
in
fact
the
answer
to
the
sculpture
garden;
that's
what
happened
there.
the
government
waived
part
of
what
it
been
a
public
forum;
it
put
up
fences;
it
changed
the
principal
use;
it
limited
the
public
access.
it
is
no
longer
a
park.
it
is
now
a
museum.
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood.
the
government
can--
ms.
pamela
harris
--okay.
ms.
pamela
harris
what
underlies
it
is
that
the
government
speech
--
the
government
speech
doctrine
is
an
exception
to
normal
first
amendment,
and
very
important
first
amendment
constraints.
and
what
underlies
the
distinction
is
that
that
exception
is
justified
only
when
the
government
is
speaking
for
itself.
the
government
needs
to
be
able
to
promote
its
own
messages,
its
own
ideas.
but
if
it's
not
doing
that,
if
it's
disclaiming
the
content
of
the
monument,
saying
those
are
not
our
own
ideas,
those
are
not
our
own
messages,
then
there
is
just
no
justification
for
allowing
it
to
prefer
one
form
of
private
speech
over
another.
the
justification
for
allowing
that
exception
is
missing.
ms.
pamela
harris
well,
i
do
think
that
the
--
the
city
is
a
bit
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
because
it
wants
to
have
it
both
ways.
it
wants
to
be
able
to
say
this
speech
is
governmental
for
purposes
of
blocking
equal
access
rights;
but
not
so
governmental
at
that
it's
a
big
establishment
clause
problem.
so
yes,
i
think
there
is
a
dilemma
here
for
the
city.
thank
you,
your
honors.
