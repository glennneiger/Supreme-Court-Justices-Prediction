ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
its
terms,
the
sentencing
factor
in
section
924(c)(1)(a)(iii)
contains
no
mens
rea
requirement.
rather,
it
requires
a
certain
fact
to
be
present
in
the
course
of
the
section
924(c)
offense,
namely
that
the
firearm
is
discharged.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
as
long
as
the
discharge
occurs
while
the
924(c)
offense
is
going
on--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes,
justice
scalia,
it
would
--
it
would
apply.
the
"during
and
in
relation
to"
language
from
the
principal
paragraph
is
part
of
the
offense,
but
it
does
not
carry
down
to
the
separate
sentencing
factors.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that
case
might
present
a
question
about
whether
or
not,
once
he
drops
it
in
compliance
with
a
lawful
order
to
do
so,
he
is
still
committing
the
section
924(c)
offense.
if
the
section
924(c)
offense
is
deemed
to
be
over
at
that
point,
then,
no,
the
firearm
would
not
--
the
fact
would
not
have
been
present
while
the
course
of
the
section
924(c)--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--in
our
--
under
our
theory,
the
--
there
must
be
a
temporal
connection
between
the
offense
that
--
for
which
the
defendant
is
being
sentenced,
which
is
a
section
924(c)
offense,
the
using
or
carrying
the
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
the
bank
robbery
in
your
hypothetical
or
possessing
it
in
furtherance
of
the
bank
robbery
in
your
hypothetical.
if
one
concluded
that
because
the
bank
robbery
continued,
even
though
he
was
no
longer
using
or
carrying
the
firearm
or
no
longer
possessing
it,
that
the
924(c)
offense
also
continued,
and
the
firearm
discharges
when
he
drops
it,
then,
yes,
the
firearm
is
discharged
while
the
section
924(c)
offense
is
ongoing,
and,
yes,
the
mandatory
minimum
would
apply.
but
--
but
that
hypothetical
presents
questions
about
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
section
924(c)
itself,
not
questions
about
whether
or
not
the
discharge
was
intentional
or
accidental.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
two
--
at
least
two
points
about
that,
your
honor:
the
passive
voice
makes
clear
that
congress
cared
about
the
fact
of
a
discharge,
that
congress
was
indifferent
as
to
who
discharged
the
weapon.
because
the
"is
brandished"
is
also
stated
in
the
passive
voice,
we
think
congress
was
also
indifferent
as
to
who
brandished
the
firearm,
although
there
is
a
separate
provision
giving
content
to
what
it
means
to
brandish,
and
brandish
must
be
done
in
order
to
intimidate.
so
--
but
if
a
confederate,
for
example--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--and
brandishes
it
in
order
to
intimidate
the
victims
in
the
bank,
then,
yes,
both
of
them
would
be
subject
to
the
brand
--
to
the
brandishing
enhancement.
and
even
if
one
thought
that
the
language
in
the
--
in
the
sentencing
factor,
"if
the
firearm
is
discharged",
applied
only
to
the
defendant's
conduct,
which
--
that's
not
our
position,
and
we
think
that
clearly
--
it
clearly
encompasses
others
--
ordinary
liability
rules
under
pinkerton
and
aiding
and
abetting
principles
would
hold
a
confederate
liable
for
discharge
by
another.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
again,
i
think
that
would
present
questions
about
whether
or
not
the
section
924(c)
offense
was
still
continuing,
if
the
law
enforcement
officer
has
the
weapon.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
if
the
section
924(c)
offense
is
--
is
--
is
ongoing
and
if
the
firearm
is
discharged,
the
mandatory
minimum
sentence
applies.
one
might
conclude
that
if
third
parties
take
the
weapon
and
discharge
it
--
and,
by
the
way,
i
do
believe
these
are
purely
hypotheticals.
they
point
to
no
case
where
that's
actually
been
the
case
--
but--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that's
true.
there
may
not
be
very
many
accidental
discharges,
but
there's
no
reason
to
believe
congress
wanted
courts
to
engage
in
the
inquiry
about
whether
or
not
the
defendant
accidentally
discharged
the
weapon.
if
this
court
were
to
--
to
hold
that
accident
--
accidental
discharges
are
not
covered
by
the
sentencing
factor,
i
think
that
we
would
see
more
claims
of
accidental
discharge.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
about
the
third
--
if
one
is
concerned
about
the
actions
of
third
parties
who
are
not
confederates
in
any
way
taking
the
weapon
--
and
we
do
believe
it
does
under
the
statute's
language
need
to
be
the
firearm
that
is
the
basis
of
the
section
924(c)
offense,
and
not
someone
else's
firearm.
but
if
--
if
--
in
other
words,
not
the
security
guard's
firearm.
if
the
firearm
is
discharged
by
a
third
party
--
causes
you
concern,
one
could
conclude
that
that
is
not
the
manner
in
which
the
defendant
committed
the
offense.
and
that
this
court's
decision
in
harris
described
this
type
of
sentencing
factor,
these
very
sentencing
factors,
as
the
kind
of
factor
that
one
looks
at:
is
a
fact
present
in
the
manner
in
which
the
defendant
committed
the
offense?
and
so
one
might
conclude
that
if
the
law
enforcement
officer
disarms
the
robber
and
then
later
discharges
the
weapon,
that
that
fact
of
a
discharge
is
not
part
of
the
manner
in
which
the
defendant
committed
the
offense.
we
don't
think
that's
compelled,
by
the
way.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
if
the
teller
grabs
the
gun
from
the
--
from
the
robber
and
it
discharges,
as
long
as
the
section
924(c)
offense
is
continuing,
then
the
firearm
is
discharged.
but--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--one
could
reasonably
conclude
that
if
the
teller
discharges
it
isn't
a
fact
in
the
manner
in
which
the
defendant
committed
the
offense.
but
i
do
think
there's
reason
to
believe
congress
may
have
been
concerned
about
the
fact
of
the
discharge
by
anyone.
i
mean,
what
you're
talking
about
is
someone
who's
engaging
in
inherently
dangerous
activity.
they
brought
an
armed
weapon
to
commit
a
crime
of
violence
or
a
drug
trafficking
crime,
and
they've
handled
it
in
such
a
way
that
either
it
is
discharged--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--there
is
no
question
here,
your
honor,
but
that
it
was
the
robber
that
discharged
the
weapon.
and
in
fact
the
petitioner
testified
that:
"i
pulled
the
trigger
when
i
was
switching
the
gun
from
one
hand
to
the
other.
"
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
we
have
not
challenged
that
it
was
accidental.
but
i
think
that
it--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens,
with
respect
to
sentencing
factors.
i
think
there's
no
case
in
which
this
court
has
indicated
--
and
no
common
law
principles--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
in
harris,
which
was
--
in
which
this
court
was
interpreting
these
very
sentencing
factors
here,
the
court
note
--
noted
that--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor,
because
if
it
were
an
element--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
think
it
might
be
a
harder
case
for
us
if
it
were
an
element
of
the
crime,
but
it
wouldn't
be
an
element
that
would
be
necessary.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
why
would
it
be
a
harder
case
for
us?
because
if
it
were
a
harbor
--
hard
--
if
it
were
an
element
of
the
crime,
then
it
would
be
an
aggravated
offense,
and
then
one
could
debate
whether
or
not
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
think
there
is
a
background
rule
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
criminal
offenses
that
congress
intends
some
mens
rea.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
not
--
no,
your
honor,
not
in
this
way,
because
it
--
it
would
--
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
--
case
for
us,
i
can
see,
but
that
you
would
still
be
talking
about
somebody
who
was
engaged
in
wrongful
conduct.
there
would
be
no
danger.
i
mean,
one
of
the
reasons
the
court
assumes
a
mens
rea
requirement,
or
reads
in
a
mens
rea
requirement
when
one's
not
there,
is
because
of
the
fear
of
capturing
innocent
conduct.
but
what
you
would
be
talking
about
is
someone
who
has
taken
a
loaded
weapon
to
commit
a
crime
of
violence
or
a
drug
trafficking
crime
and
used
it
during
and
in
relation
to
that
crime
or
to
--
possessed
it
in
furtherance
of
that
crime
and
is
already
guilty.
they
are
engaged
in--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--they
both
engaged
in
inherently
dangerous
activity.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
right.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
and
it's
common
in
criminal
law
to
hold
criminals
responsible
for
their
unintended
consequences
of
their
criminal
acts,
and
that's
--
in
your
hypothetical
it
wouldn't
be
unusual
at
all
to
hold
someone
liable
for
the
accidental
discharge
when
they've
taken
a
loaded
weapon
to
commit
a
violent
crime,
here
a
bank
robbery,
and
handled
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
goes
off.
it's
completely
reasonable
for
congress
to
conclude--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
no
--
well,
they're
--
just
to
be
clear,
they're
both
subject
to
life
imprisonment
for
taking
the
gun
and
committing
--
and
using
it
to
commit
the
bank
robbery.
so
it's
not
tacking
on
three
years;
it's
increasing
the
minimum.
and
that
is
a
significant
difference,
justice
stevens
said
this
court
has
recognized
with
respect
to
these
various
factors
in
harris
itself,
that
the
--
whether
or
not
there
was
a
discharge
is--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--as
a
practical
matter,
no,
your
honor.
however,
had
the
accidental
discharge
caused
a
death,
then
he
would
have
committed
a
more
serious
offense,
and
that
may
have
been
the
penalty.
but
the
point
is
that
one
is
often
subject
to
higher
penalties
than
one
might
have
expected
by
the
unintended
consequences
of
one's
criminal
act.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--and
that's
our
view.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
but
that
would
be
a
reconceptualization
of
the
rule
of
lenity,
justice
breyer.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
and
one
--
it
would
be
a
--
as
you
said
for
this
court,
in
muscarello,
the
rule
of
lenity
has
never
been
a
rule
where
the
defendant
always
prevails.
and
it
would
be
an
odd
notion
to
have
a
more
muscular
rule
of
lenity
in
the
sentencing
enhancement
context
than
you
have
with
respect
to
the
crime
itself.
the
whole
point
of
having
the
mandatory
minimum
is
to
take
away
discretion
from
judges.
what
--
and
the
language
of
the
statute
here
in
our
view
is
clear.
it
says
"if
the
firearm
is
discharged",
and
i
think
it's
the
present
tense
that
gets
you
the
--
the
temporal
connection
to
the
crime
here.
if
it
is
discharged
while
you
are
using
or
carrying
it
or
possessing
it,
in
the
offense
in
the
principal
paragraph,
congress
wanted
you
to
have
10
years.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
in
the
blue
brief,
they
lay
out
the
house's
final
version,
and
we
have
the
house's
final
version
in
one
of
our
footnotes.
and
then
they
lay
out
the
senate's
final
version.
and
one
important
distinction,
justice
breyer,
between
those
two
versions
is
that
the
house's
version
would
have
made
it
active
voice,
but
not
only
active,
but
it
would
have
been
amenable
to
the
argument
that
"during
and
in
relation
to"
modifies
"discharges",
because
the
structure
was
different.
but
the
house
would
have
set
the
penalty
for
a
discharge
at
20
years.
okay.
that's
--
you
can
infer
from
that
that
the
house
thought
an
intentional
discharge
should
subject
you
to
20
years.
the
senate's
version,
which
put
it
in
the
passive
voice,
said
10
years.
and
i
think
you
can
infer
from
that,
justice
breyer,
the
--
the
current
structure
allows
what
you're
positing,
which
is
more
culpable
defendants
who
intend
to
discharge
the
firearm
to
receive
a
higher
sentence.
and
one
could
infer,
i
think,
that
the
house
thinks
that
should
be
20
years.
so
i
think
the
--
the
current
structure
does
allow
judges
to
take
into
consideration.
it
just
sets
the
floor.
and
congress
is
entitled
to
do
that,
and
i
think
they
have
clearly
done
that
and
then
to
take
out
of
the
realm
of
debate
whether
or
not
the
defendant
intended
to
discharge
the
firearm
or
didn't
mean
to
discharge
the
firearm.
i
would
like
to
--
to
say
one
factual
point,
which
is
in
the
--
in
the
indictment
petitioner
actually
was
charged
with
use
or
carrying.
it
just
seems
--
if
i
could
explain,
the
"use
or
carry
during
or
in
relation
to.
"
is
one
prong,
one
way
in
which
to
commit
the
principal
offense.
"possessing
in
furtherance"
is
another
way
to
commit
the
principal
offense.
the
"use
or
carry"
is
not
modified
by
"possession
in
furtherance
of",
and
"possess"
is
not
modified
by
--
by
"during
or
in
relation
to",
which
is
another
reason
it
makes
no
sense
to
--
to
trail
the
"during
or
in
relation
to"
down
to
the
generally
applicable
sentencing
factors.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the
legislative
--
well,
the
words
are
obviously
different;
the
text
is
different;
and
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
congress
wanted
a
beefed-up
"in
relation
to"
requirement
for
possession
in
order
to
make
sure
that
incidental
possession
during
--
you
know,
incidental
possession
while
one
was
also
committing
a
crime
wasn't
captured.
so
the
"in
furtherance
of"--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--no,
sir.
the
"in
relation
to"
--
the
"during
or
in
relation
to"
modifier
modifies
only
"use
or
carry".
and
if
one
is
charged
with
a
"use
or
carry"
offense,
then
the
government
must
show
that
you
"used
or
carried
during
or
in
relation
to.
"
in
the
way
those
words
have
been
given
meaning
by
this
court.
if
you're
charged
with
possession,
the
government
must
show
that
you
possessed
the
firearm
in
furtherance
of.
now,
the
--
the
"in
furtherance
of"
and
the
"in
relation
to"
prong
have
been
given
similar
meanings
by
the
courts,
although
generally
it's
thought
that
the
"in
furtherance
of",
like
i
say,
is
a
sort
of
beefed-up
"in
relation
to"
requirement
--
requires
a--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--he
would
be
carrying,
justice
breyer.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
he
would
be
carrying
--
if
i
understood
you,
he
would
be
carrying.
and
if
he
was
also
committing
a
crime,
he
would
be
carrying
--
if
he
was
also
committing
a
crime
of
violence,
he
would
be
carrying
it
during
the
crime
of
violence.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
but
under
this
court's
decision
in
smith,
if
it
were--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
statute
does
say
carrying
has
to
be
in
relation
to--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
am
sorry.
i
thought
you
were
asking
me
a
"carry"
hypothetical.
if
you
are
asking
me
a
"possession"
hypothetical--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--it
doesn't.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
you
are
right.
okay.
i
am
sorry.
i
answered--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--it's
hard
to
see
how
one
could
meet
this
court's
definition
in
smith
for--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--for
"in
relation
to",
which
was
to
have--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
underlying--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
carrying
has
to
be
in
relation
to
the
underlying
drug
crime
or
crime
of
violence.
this
court
gave
content
to
"in
relation
to"
in
smith
to
mean
have
some
purpose
or
effect,
facilitate
or
further
the
underlying
crime,
not
be
by
accident
or
coincidence.
the
gist
of
petitioner's
argument
here
is
they
want
to
read
that
"accident
or
coincidence"
language
down
to
modify
"discharge".
and
structurally
that
--
that
just
doesn't
work.
and
if
--
if
i
can
make
one
more
point
about
why
it's
clear
it
isn't
that,
which
is
that
the
--
the
"in
possession
in
furtherance
of
requirement.
"
--i
mean
one
of
the
things
they
say
in
response
to
our
argument
is
that
we
are
willing
to
put
a
temporal
limitation
on
the
sentencing
factors,
but
not
an
"in
relation
to"--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--definitely
not,
no.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the
--
the
sentencing
factors
are
set
out
separately.
and
you
don't
get
to
them--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
you
have
to
be
guilty
of
the
principal
offense,
justice
stevens,
before
you
get
to
the
sentencing
factors.
so
you
have
to
have
either--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--right.
the
definitive--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--it
has
to
be
during
and
--
but
there
--
but
it's
not
because
the
word
"during"
appears
in
the
principal
offense,
which
is
how
they
would
have
our
argument
be.
the
--
the
--
it
has
to
--
the
sentencing
factor
has
to
occur.
first
you
have
to
commit
the
principal
--
let
me
just
back
up.
you
have
to
commit
the
principal
offense.
so,
you've
used--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--it
has
to
be
"during"
for
three
reasons:
one,
the
--
the
language
of
the
sentencing
factor
says
"if
the
firearm
is
discharged".
it's
in
the
present
tense.
so
the
present
tense
of
the
"is
discharged"
language
--
it
has
to
be
while
you're
using,
carrying
--
"uses,
carries,
or
possesses.
"
is
also
in
the
act.
the
"is
discharged"
has
to
happen
while
you're
using,
carrying,
or
possessing.
that
takes
out
hypotheticals
about,
well,
it
was
discharged
at
the
factory
before
i
got
it,
and
law
enforcement
discharged
it
well
after
they
took
it
from
me
to
test
the
ballistics
on
it.
those
aren't
covered
because
it's
not
"is
discharged"
while
you're
using,
carrying,
or
possessing.
secondly,
this
court
in
harris
recognized
that
these
are
the
types
of
sentencing
factors
that
one
considers
when
deciding
whether
a
certain
fact
is
present
in
the
manner
in
which
an
offense
is
committed.
so
the
fact
has
to
be
present
in
the
commission
of
the
offense.
that's
just
the
way
this
type
of
sentencing
factor
operates,
and
the
court
so
interpreted
these
particular
sentencing
factors
in
harris.
and
we
know
that
it's
not
because
of
the
"during"
in
the
principal
paragraph,
justice
stevens,
because
there
is
no
"during"
element
to
the
"possession"
prong.
nevertheless,
the
sentencing
factors
apply
to
that
prong,
and
we
would
apply
temporal
limitations
to
them.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes,
your
honor,
and
if
you
possess
a
firearm--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the
"during"
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
sentencing
factor
is
in
the
present
tense,
and
says
"is
discharged".
that
means
that
the
"is
discharged"
must
occur
while
the
offense
is
--
is
occurring.
so
the
temporal
limitation
comes
from
--
and
is
from
the
nature
of
these
types
of
sentencing
factors,
which
ask:
is
this
fact
present?
that's
what
congress
cared
about.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
exactly.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
possession
--
it
would
just
have
to
be
possession
that
was
in
furtherance
of
an
underlying
crime.
once
you're
guilty
of
that,
if
the
firearm
was
discharged
while
you
were
guilty
of
that--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--some
temporal
limitation,
and
the
limitation
is
what
--
is
that
it
must
be
discharged
while
you're
committing
the
offense
for
which
you're
being
sentenced
when
we're
looking
at
sentencing
factors,
which
is
--
as
set
forth
in
924(c).
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
again,
it
would
turn
on
--
on
--
it
wouldn't
turn
on
whether
accidental
or
intentional
discharge,
justice
stevens.
that
would
present
a
difficult
hypothetical
about
whether
or
not
the
924(c)--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--if
--
if
it
were
determined
that
the
--
the
924(c)
offense,
which
is
the
possession
in
furtherance
of
a
crime,
were
still
going
on
at
that
point
--
in
other
words,
he
was
still
possessing
it
in
furtherance
of
the
underlying
crime
of
violence,
and
it
discharges
--
then,
yes,
the
sentencing
factor,
by
its
plain
terms,
applies.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
the
--
no,
the
"in
furtherance
of",
it
--
the
inquiry
we
would
be
making
at
sentencing,
justice
stevens,
is
not
was
the
discharge
in
furtherance
of.
you
would
--
you
would
--
all
you
would
be
asking
is,
were
you
still
possessing
a
firearm
in
furtherance--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
discharge
must
be
temporally
related
to
the
principal
offense,
yes,
because
the
discharge
is
--
is
discharged
while
you're
in
the
course
of
the
principal
offense.
that's
the
way
these
types
of
sentencing
factors--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--right.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the
"during
and"--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--no,
your
honor.
i
mean,
just
to
make
sure
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
the
"during
and
in
relation
to"
only
modifies
the
verbs
"uses
or
carries"?
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
okay.
the
two--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that's
their
argument.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor.
[laughter]
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that's
right.
and
also--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
reason
we
don't
believe
that's
the
correct
reading
is
because,
as
this
court
indicated
in
harris,
the
principal
offense
--
the
principal
paragraph
sets
forth
the
complete
crime,
and
it
ends
with
"shall".
so
once
you
do
the
things
in
the
principal
for
crime,
you're
guilty.
and
then
the
only
question
is,
what
shall
your
sentence
be?
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
just
to
be--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--just
to
be
clear
about--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--it
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
or
not
it
intentionally
went
off,
justice
stevens.
your
hypothetical
could
still
raise
a
question--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize,
though,
that
congress
didn't
want
to
open
the
door
to
claims
that
--
that
the
firearm
was
discharged
accidentally.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
right.
i
mean,
the
--
the
fact
of
a
discharge
is
what
congress
was
clearly
concerned
about,
and
you
can
tell
that
from
the
text.
what
i
did
want
to
say
is
that
in
the
indictment
here
he
was
actually
charged
with
uses,
carries,
and
possesses.
the
indictment
is
not
perfectly
worded.
it
only
has
the
"during
and
in
relation
to"
in
it,
but
the
--
the
instructions
were
proper
and
there
were
no
--
the
jury
instructions
at
trial
were
proper
and
there
were
no
--
no
objection
to
the
instructions,
but
i
did
want
to
correct
one
point
about
that.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
