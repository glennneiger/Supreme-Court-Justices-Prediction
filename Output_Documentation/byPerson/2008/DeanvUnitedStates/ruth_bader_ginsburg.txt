mr.
forster,
there
are
three
levels
under
this:
possession,
brandishing,
and
if
the
gun
is
discharged.
you
--
you
don't
quarrel
with
the
notion
that
dean
at
least
brandished
this
gun?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we're
talking
about
a
three-year
difference
between
brandishing
and
if
the
gun
is
discharged?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
doesn't
say
--
it
says,
"if
the
gun
is
discharged".
and
i
think
on
the
government's
reading,
it
would
cover
the
police
officer
who
is
trying
to
apprehend
the
robber
and
fires
a
gun.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
the
police
officer
who
snatches
the
gun.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
is
using
the
robber's
gun,
but
by
the
police
officer
who
is
apprehending
him.
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
the
government's
view,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
the
police
officer.
it
has
to
be
the
gun
of
the
robber,
but
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
the
robber
or
the
police
officer
who
discharges
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
has
a
very
specific
--
what
are
the
words
that
define
what
is
brandishing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
--
i
didn't
think
the
government
or
anybody
was
reading
the
definition
of
brandishing
to
include
a
police
officer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
part
of
the
background
here
that
it
was
proposed
at
the
time
these
enhancements
came
into
the
law.
it
was
proposed
that
there
be
a
specific
state
of
mind
requirement
for
the
discharge
of
a
gun,
and
that
was
not
enacted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
part
of
the
legislative
history
was
that
there
were
proposals
--
i
mean,
there
is
a
rather
sharp
difference
between
"possess"
--
yes,
you
have
to
have
a
knowledge,
intent
element
--
"brandishing",
very
clear,
for
purposes
of
intimidation
--
then
"discharge"
has
no
--
it's
just
that
the
gun
is
discharged.
weren't
there
proposals
to
include
something
like
what
was
included
for
the
other
two,
that
is,
that
there
be
an
intent
requirement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there's
accidents
and
accidents.
and
couldn't
one
say,
looking
at
this
that,
well,
we
will
--
the
state
will
find
that
the
culpability
that
we
will
attribute
to
this
statute
is
reckless?
if
recklessness
were
the
requirement,
certainly
the
facts
of
this
case
would
fit,
would
they
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
accept
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
say
reckless
is
not
enough;
it
has
to
be
knowing.
this
is
not
a
mere
accident.
it's
--
this
--
the
gun
was
loaded,
it
wasn't
locked,
and
he's
raking
in
money
with
one
hand,
holding
the
gun
with
the
other.
the
teller
is
crouching
down.
i
mean,
there
was
--
there
was
a
pretty
substantial
risk
of
something
going
wrong,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
--
the
"use
or
carry"
certainly
has
to
be
in
relation
--
during
and
in
relation
to,
but
that's
step
one.
so
he
already
is
using
and
carrying
or
carrying
in
relation
to
the
bank
robbery.
and
then
--
so
that's
the
starting
premise.
that
excludes
all
your
things
about
"years
before"
or
"years
after"
he
carried
--
he
carried
a
gun.
you
--
step
one
narrows
it
to
the
person
who
uses
or
carries
a
gun
in
connection
with
a
bank
robbery.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
--
you
say
that
this
background
principle,
that
there
has
to
be
a
state
of
mind
element
--
and
we
can
accept
that
that's
a
general
principle.
but
here
we
have
a
provision
that
does
require
a
state
of
mind
--
specifically
requires
a
state
of
mind
for
the
possession,
for
the
brandishing,
intent
to
intimidate,
but
here
is
this
other
one
that
suddenly
doesn't.
so
wouldn't
the
text
of
this
statute
say
--
well,
the
third
one,
discharging
a
gun,
they
didn't
mean
to
have
any
element
because
--
any
element
of
mens
rea
--
because
they
had
it
in
number
(i)
and
(ii),
and
(iii)
leaves
it
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
be
the
same
--
you
would
give
the
same
answer
if
the
teller
grabbed
the
gun
from
the
robber
and
it
went
off?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
alternate
position
would
apply
to
the
teller
as
well
as
the
police
officer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
difference,
a
practical
difference,
between
the
two
formulations?
