mr.
scott
j.
forster
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
the
discharge
provision
of
924(c)
carries
with
it
some
requirement
of
intent.
we
believe
that
the
answer
to
this
question
is
yes.
and
to
that
end,
we
would
cite
to
the
--
to
the
text
of
the
statute
itself
as
well
as
the
history
involved,
the
presumption
of
mens
rea
that
is
inherent
in
all
statutes
such
as
this
court's
case
law
has
been
clear
on
as
well
as
the
principle
of
the
rule
of
lenity,
if
we
get
to
that
point,
and
if
the
court
deems
that
there
is
some
type
of
ambiguity.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
we
--
we
do
not
dispute
that,
your
honor.
no,
he
clearly
intentionally
brandished
the
weapon.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
yes,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
right.
and
the
statute
in
924
requires
that
the
use
of
the
firearm
be
during
and
in
relation
to
the
underlying
crime
of
violence,
which
in
this
case
is
a
bank
robbery.
and
we
believe
that
the
proper
reading
of
the
statute
would
require
that
the
discharge
also
be
done
during
and
in
relation
to
the
underlying
crime
of
violence.
otherwise,
the
statute
simply
would
not
make
any
sense.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
your
honor,
i
think
that
it's
a
transitive
verb
the
way
it's
used.
by
definition,
it
would
have
some
object.
someone
would
have
had
to
have
discharged
the
weapon.
and
so
i
think
that
the
court's
cases
on
mens
rea
and
so
forth
would
continue
to
apply,
even
given
the
way
that
the
--
that
it's
phrased
in
the
statute.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--i'm
not
sure
it
would
make
a
difference
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
think
there's
any
--
i
think
that
by
definition
the
court
would
have
to
ask
itself
who
discharged
the
weapon.
i
don't
think
you
can
just
use
the
word
"discharge"
in
a
vacuum.
it
has
to
be
during
and
in
relation--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
the
statute
would,
because
the
individual
who
would
be
charged
with
it
would
not
himself
had
"during"
or
"and
in
relation
to"
the
underlying
crime
of
violence.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
under
the
government's
theory
that
would
be
true.
but
i
think
that
would
open
up--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--no,
justice
scalia,
not
under
our
reading.
i
think--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--that's
true,
ma'am.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
--
that
the
hypothetical
of
the
guard
waving
the
gun
around
--
i
don't
think
that
would
meet
the
definition
of
924
defines
it.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
justice
ginsburg,
"brandish"
is
defined
under
the
statute
a
couple
of
different
ways.
the
--
the
dictionary
definition
of
"brandish",
which
is
to
grab
something
and
wave
it
around,
is
certainly
contained
in
that.
but
the
definition
goes
further.
the
definition
also
says
that
if
i,
for
example,
make
known
that
i
have
a
gun,
if
i
pass
a
note
saying
i
have
a
gun,
that
would
also
be
brandishing
under
the
statute.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
the
way
the
government's
brief
--
well,
with
regards
to
brandish,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
the
government
goes
that
far.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
with
that
simply
for
this
reason:
this
court's
case
law
is
clear
that
if
congress
wants
to
do
away
with
the
mens
rea
element,
they
must
affirmatively
do
so.
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
proper
to
say
that
because
there's
a
specific
definition
of
"brandish",
therefore
they
meant
discharge
to
be
basically
strict
liability.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
would
be
disregarding
the
presumption
of
mens
rea
that
exists
pursuant
to
this
court's
case
law
as
well
as
the
requirement--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
this
statute
is
driven
by
consequence.
and
as
i
understand
your
honor's
hypothetical--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--because
the
words
that
the
statute
uses
are
directly
focused
to
the
--
to
the
conduct
of
the
defendant:
"possess,
use,
brandish,
discharge.
"
as
opposed
to,
for
example,
carjacking.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
your
honor,
certainly
under
the
statute
the
court
had
far
more
authority
than
the
10
years
it
imposed,
and
i
think
congress
is
clear
that
they
--
they
allowed
for
substantially
larger
sentences
in
such
a
case.
this
case
obviously
just
discusses
the
application
of
the
mandatory
minimum.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
your
honor,
obviously
--
i
mean,
the
risk
certainly
does
go
up.
but
as
i
--
as
i
think
the
statute
is
written,
it's
not
driven
by
what
the
risk
is.
as
i
say,
as
opposed
to--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
a
jury
would
be
--
would
make
that
decision,
because
under
this
court's
authority
in
harris,
that
would
be
for
the
judge;
and
--
and
obviously
criminals
would
make
these
claims,
and
it
would
be--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--under
this
court's
authority
in
harris,
your
honor,
brandish
and
discharge
are
not
elements
of
the
offense
that
must
be
indicted
and
proved
to
a
jury.
they
are
sentencing
elements
--
or
enhancements,
if
you
will,
that
--
that
would
be
up
to
the
judge,
and
that's
this
court's
harris
ruling.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
this
court
has
never
said
that
merely
because
it
is
a
sentencing
enhancement,
rather
than
an
element
of
the
offense,
that
somehow
the
statutory
rules
of
construction
cease
to
apply.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
i
didn't
hear
the
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
your
honor,
there
were
various
drafts
in
the
house
and
the
senate
that
--
that
specifically
provided
the
intent
requirement.
the
compromise
that
came
out
was
basically
a
disagreement
over
the
penalty,
and
the
language
that
the
congress
used,
"during
and
in
relation
to",
necessarily
implies
some
type
of
an
intent
element.
i
think
the
circuits
are
clear
on
that;
it
has
to
be
knowing,
otherwise
it's
not
during
and
in
relation
to.
and
so
i
believe
that
the
choice
of
language
that
congress
uses
--
there
has
to
be
the
connection,
we
believe,
between
the
use
--
during
and
in
relation
to
and
the
discharge.
otherwise
the
statute
makes
no
sense,
because
it
wouldn't
be
triggered
by
anything.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
we
don't--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--your
honor--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--your
honor,
in
the
committee
reports
and
so
forth,
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
they
did
not
intend
an
unintentional
or
an
accidental
discharge
to
be
covered.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
your
honor,
the
requirement
--
we
think
that
the
discharge,
again,
must
be
during
and
in
relation
to.
there
has
to
be
that
connection.
and--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--i
don't
think
this
case
--
this
court's
case
law
would
support
a
finding
that
an
accidental
use
would
have
been
in
relation
to.
that's
this
court's
ruling
in
smith.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
i
think
that
the
evidence
would
suggest
that
he
was
reckless--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--but
i
don't
believe
that
it
was
knowing.
and
i
--
and
then
i
think
that--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--absolutely,
there
was.
but
i
think
this
court's
authority
in
smith
talks
about
the
--
the
intent
element
that
is
inherent
in
this.
it
has
to
be
purposeful,
it
has
--
it
cannot
be
by
accident,
and
that's
what
this
court
ruled
in
smith.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
justice
scalia,
sir,
we
believe
that
the
proper
--
that
the
better
reading
would
be
some
connection
between
those
two,
between
the
discharge
and
the
underlying
--
the
during
and
relation
to.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
your
honor,
if
that
were
the
--
if
that
were
the
interpretation,
then
it
would
lead
to
what
we
consider
to
be
some
of
the
absurdities
as
far
as
the
results
go.
if
there
is
no
connection
between
"during
and
in
relation
to"
--
as
i
will
refer
to
it
as
"the
connection"
--
in
absence
of
that
connection,
any
number
of
different
things
could
occur,
and
that
connection
is
what
makes
this
statute
make
sense.
and
i
believe
that
the
government
basically
acknowledges
that
in
their
brief,
that
there
has
to
be
--
if
there's
not
some
connection
--
i
think
it's
page
29
of
the
government's
brief.
that
when
we
discussed
the
absurd
results
that
might
flow
from
a
statute
where
there
is
no
such
connection,
what
the
government
says
--
i
believe
it's
on
page
29
--
is
that
to
avoid
these
absurd
results,
this
connection
does
exist.
but
then
the
next
sentence
they
say:
but
it
doesn't
mean
there
is
a
mens
rea.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
government
wants
in
that
case
is
the
"during
and
in
relation
to"
has
to
apply
to
"discharge"
to
avoid
the
absurd
results,
but
yet
they
don't
want
smith
to
go
along
with
it.
and
smith
said
that
during
and
in
relation
to
is
purposeful,
has
to
have
an
effect,
and
it
can't
be
done
by
accident.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
any
discharge
any
other
time.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
that's
the
connection
that
we
believe
exists.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
the
--
the
best
way
to
read
it.
i
think
it
has
to
be
during
and
in
relation
to
the
bank
robbery.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
and
--
and
i
would
agree
with
that,
and
then
when
you
take
this
court's
authority
in
smith
to
say
that
that
type
use
during
and
in
relation
to
cannot
be
accidental.
and
so
i
go
back
to
the
original
question
your
honor
asked
me,
did
he
intentionally
brandish
it?
clearly.
and
so
we
believe
that
if
--
if
this
case
we
are
here
about
is
fit
into
smith,
he's
on
the
hook
for
the
seven
years
under
brandish,
but
because
the
discharge
was
accidental,
it
cannot
constitute
use
under
this
court's
authority
in
smith.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
i
don't
know
that
i
would
use
the
word
"enhancement",
your
honor.
the
principal
body
of
924--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--carries
with
it
"uses"
as
in
this
case
as
well
as
later
on
in
the
statute
"possesses".
so
it
says
both.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
if
it
is
in
furtherance--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--if
it's--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--the
--
i
believe,
under
the
reading
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
they're
separate.
he
could
have
been
charged
arguably
with
possession--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--in
furtherance
of,
but
he
wasn't.
he
was
charged
with
using
during
and
in
relation
to
the
underlying
crime
of
violence.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
well--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--your
honor,
i
think
that
you
would
then
have
to
turn
to
this
court's
--
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
the
best
reading
of
the
statute.
it
doesn't
make
sense
any
other
way
to
say
that
you
can
have
the
gun
discharged
but
not
be
during
and
in
relation
to
the
underlying
crime
of
violence.
it
doesn't
make
sense.
second,
i
believe
that
this
court's
statutory
rules
of
construction
would
say
that
if
congress
wanted
to
do
away
with
the
mens
rea
element
in
this
case,
they
would
have
had
to
have
done
so
expressly.
and
we
don't
believe
that
they
did.
now,
every
circuit
that
has
discussed
the
requirement
of
"during
and
in
relation
to"
has
found
a
knowledge
requirement,
that
you
can't
not
know
the
gun
is
there,
for
example.
there
has
to
be
the
knowledge
requirement.
and
that
this
court's
authority
in
smith
suggests
or
says
clearly
that
it
cannot
be
used
accidentally.
so
now
the
question
becomes
this:
if
the
court
decides
that
during
--
that
the
discharge
must
be
during
and
in
relation
to,
and
when
the
court
does
that
it
takes
its
own
authority
in
smith
to
say
that
it
has
to
be
purposeful,
it
has
to
have
the
effect
of
the
commission
of
the
crime,
now
is
--
would
the
use
in
this
case
be
subject
to
smith?
and
smith
was
clear
that
accidental
discharge
simply
--
or
accidental
use,
rather
--
it
didn't
talk
about
discharge
exactly
--
but
that
accidental
use
would
never
be,
because
it--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--your
honor,
if
--
i
believe
such
an
interpretation
would
basically
mean
that
that
silence
would
be
interpreted
as
a
strict
liability,
that
silence
with
regards
to
the
specific
intent
requirement
would
mean
the
congress
meant
that
no
intent
was
necessary.
and
that's
simply
never
what
these
cases
from
this
court
have
held.
there
is
the
presumption
that
congress
operates
against,
and
if
they
wish
to
eliminate
the
mens
rea
element,
they
must
do
so
expressly.
and
we
simply
do
not
believe
that
it
--
that
it
happened
in
this
case.
one
last
point
is,
we
believe
there's
nothing
else
that
congress
would
have
had
to
have
done
to
establish
a
general
intent,
and
if
that's
true,
then
i
think
the
very
least
that
could
be
said
about
our
interpretation
is
that
it
would
be
a
reasonable
one,
in
which
case
lenity
principles
would
then
come
into
play.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there's
no
other
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
thank
you.
mr.
scott
j.
forster
this
court
in
u.s.
gypsum
was
very
clear
when
it
said
that
far
more
than
the
simple
omission
of
the
appropriate
phrase
of
a
statutory
definition
is
necessary
to
justify
dispensing
with
the
intent
requirement.
and
our
argument
is
simply
this:
merely
because
this
might
be
a
sentencing
enhancement,
rather
than
an
element
of
the
offense,
this
court
never
said
that
the
normal
rules
of
statutory
construction
cease
to
apply
under
those
circumstances,
which
means
that
the
mens
rea
presumption
is
appropriate
in
this
case.
and
just
like
this
court
said
in
the
passage
i
just
cited,
if
congress
wants
to
dispense
with
that
requirement,
they
must
do
so
clearly,
and
they
simply
did
not
do
that
in
this
case.
if
they
wanted
to
do
that,
they
could
insert
the
words
"intentionally"
or
"unintentionally
discharge",
in
which
case
that
would
be
clear.
and
that
simply
is
not
the
way
this
statute
reads.
the
best
reading
of
the
statute,
i
believe,
and
this
is
what
your
honor
was
headed
toward,
is
to
read
the
discharge
to
require
during
and
in
relation
to.
i
just
think
that's
the
best--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--but,
your
honor--
mr.
scott
j.
forster
--not
under
this
court's
authority
in
smith.
i
think
smith
is
clear.
it
must
have
purpose
and
effect
and
not
be
used
by
accident.
mr.
scott
j.
forster

gypsum.
mr.
scott
j.

i
believe
it

i
believe
it
is,
