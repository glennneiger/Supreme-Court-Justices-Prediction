justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what
--
what
--
i
guess
i'm
not
following
this.
you
say
it
would
be
true
that
if
the
blank
--
if
the
bank
guard
fires
his
own
gun
when
--
when
the
bank
robber
is
fleeing,
that
would
come
within
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you
say
under
the
government's
it
would?
i
don't
think
it
would
under
the
government's
either.
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
that's
different,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
guess
it's
also
the
government's
view
--
and
this
is
even
weirder
--
that
it
doesn't
matter
who
brandishes
the
gun.
so
the
bank
--
the
bank
guard
grabs
the
gun
and
brandishes
the
gun,
and
that
also
gets
additional
time
served
for
the
bank
robber.
it
doesn't
seem
fair.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
conduct.
i
mean,
it
isn't
just
bad
luck.
this
is
--
what
we
have
here
is
a
negligent
bank
robber.
i
mean,
he
has
left
the
safety
off,
okay,
and
--
and
trips
the
gun.
i
mean,
bank
robbing
is
bad
enough,
but
negligent
bank
robbing
is
something
----
[laughter]
--is
something
that
should
be
punished
more
severely.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me?
that
would
be
for
the
judge?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
--
it's
during
the
bank
robbery.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
you
place
a
lot
of
reliance
on
this
"during
and
in
relation
to"
any
--
any
crime
of
violence
or
drug
trafficking
crime.
but
that's
--
that's
in
the
prologue,
and
it
applies
only
to
the
matter
covered
in
the
prologue
--
to
wit,
"during
and
in
relation
to
any
crime
of
violence
or
drug
trafficking
crime,
for
which
the
person
may
be
prosecuted
in
a
court
of
the
united
states,
uses
or
carries
a
firearm
or
in
furtherance
of
any
such
crime
possesses
a
firearm.
"
that's
--
that's
what
all
that
language
"during
and
in
relation
to"
applies
to.
and
then
it
continues:
"shall"
--
if
that
"in
relation
to"
existed
--
"in
addition
to
the
punishment
provided
for
such
crime
--
(i)
be
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
of
not
less
than
5.
"
(ii)
--
and
number
(iii)
--
what
we're
dealing
with
here
--
"if
the
firearm
is
discharged,
be
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
of
not
less
than
10
years.
"
i
don't
see
how
that
language
"during
and
in
relation
to
any
crime
of
violence.
"
applies
to
anything,
except
the
use
or
carrying
of
a
firearm.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
how
could
you
--
how
could
you
make
the
lack
of
connection
any
clearer
than
by
ending
the
first
--
the
introduction
with
a
dash,
and
then
putting
(i),
(ii),
and
(iii)?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
applies
to
the
portion
before
the
dash.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
would
--
how
would
a
discharge
not
be
during
and
in
relation
to?
give
me
an
example
of
--
of
what
you're
worried
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
--
excuse
me.
that's
not
--
that's
not
covered.
number
(iii)
only
applies
to
someone
who
has
already
been
guilty
of
what's
set
forth
in
the
prologue.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
only
connection
that's
necessary.
you
have
to
have
done
what
was
set
forth
in
the
prologue,
and
it
has
--
has
to
be
in
the
course
of
doing
that.
but
"the
course
of
doing
that"
means
just
in
the
course
of
using
a
firearm
in
connection
with
the
bank
robbery.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
we
have
to
find
that
the
phrase
"if
a
firearm
is
brandished"
and
the
later
phrase
"if
a
firearm
is
discharged"
require
intentional
brandishing
and
intentional
discharging?
why
can't
we
limit
it
by
saying,
oh,
of
course
it
means
if
the
firearm
is
brandished
by
the
bank
robber
or
by
the
felon
or
if
it's
discharged
by
the
felon,
but
leaving
it
quite
undetermined
whether
it
has
to
be
intentionally
discharged,
or
even
intentionally
brandished
for
that
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
definition
of
brandishing,
i
guess,
requires
some
intent
to
put
another
person
in
fear.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
--
does
it
require
that
the
discharge
be
during
and
in
relation
to
the
crime?
i
mean,
suppose
the
bank
robber,
you
know,
he
sees
--
son
of
a
gun,
he
sees
among
the
customers
a
man
that
ran
off
with
his
wife
a
year
ago,
and
he
is
just
overcome
with
anger,
and
he
--
you
know,
he
takes
a
shot
at
this
guy.
it's
not
in
relation
to
the
bank
robbery.
would
--
would
that
discharge
be
covered?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
--
regardless
of
whether
it's
intentional
or
accidental,
do
you
think
that
he
has
to
discharge
it
or
that
he
has
to
brandish
it?
it
is
the
passive
voice.
does
it
mean
if
anybody
discharges
it
or
brandishes
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
grabs
it
out
of
his
hand
and
brandishes
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
really
have
to
decide
all
this
stuff,
do
we?
we
just
have
to
decide
whether,
if
he
discharges
it,
the
discharge
has
to
be
intentional.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
during
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
it
can't
come
from
the
prologue,
because
if
it
came
from
the
prologue,
it
wouldn't
apply
to
the
mere
possession.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
possession
could
be
at
any
time,
before
the
crime,
after
the
crime,
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
import
some
--
some
contemporaneous
--
contemporaneous
requirement
into
the
(i),
(ii),
and
(iii).
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
your
argument
because
if
that
was
the
only
--
if
that
was
the
source
of
the
contemporaneous
requirement,
there
would
be
no
contemporaneous
requirement
for
the
"in
furtherance"?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
provision
--
"in
furtherance"
provision--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and,
of
course,
some
of
these
difficult
hypotheticals
such
as
the
one
that
justice
stevens
put
about
the
gun
going
off
while
the
--
while
the
individual
is
escaping,
that's
going
to
be
a
problem
whether
you
adopt
your
interpretation
or
the
--
or
the
petitioner's
interpretation.
even
if
you
assume
that
it
has
to
be
during
and
in
relation
to,
it's
still
going
to
be
a
problem.
is
this
--
is
this
during
and
in
relation
to
the
crime--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it
occurs,
you
know,
five
hours
later
while
he's
escaping?
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
have
to
decide
that,
do
we?
