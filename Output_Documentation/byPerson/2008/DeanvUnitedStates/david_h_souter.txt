well,
they've
run
into
the
problem,
which
is
also
a
different
problem
for
you,
and
that
is
the
brandishing
must
be
for
the
purposes
of
--
for
the
purpose
of
intimidating.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that's
probably
going
to
eliminate
the
case
in
which
the
officer
grabs
the
felon's
gun.
so
the
problem
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it
creates
for
you
is
that
"brandish"
is
specifically
defined
to
have
that
particular
intentional
element.
there
is,
however,
no
definition
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
term
in
question
here,
which
suggests
that
they
did
not
have
any
discharge
--
that
they
did
not
have
any
--
any
--
any
intent
to
impose
an
intent
requirement.
when
they
do
it,
they
know
how
to
do
it.
in
this
case.
they
didn't
do
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
it
improper?
i
mean,
it
may
not
be
conclusive,
but
it
seems
to
me
evidence
that
points
in
that
direction.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
have
--
we
have
lots
of
cases
in
which
it
makes
sense
to
disregard
that
presumption,
and
--
and
nobody
thinks
twice
about
it,
i
mean,
accomplice
liability
being
an
example.
there
are
--
there
are
lots
of
state
crimes
in
which
it
is
dispensed
with,
reckless
driving,
death
resulting.
and
in
all
of
those
cases,
what
in
effect
the
rationale
is
that
the
--
that
the
individual
who
is
being
charged
has
created
a
risk.
no
one
can
control
that
risk,
including
himself,
but
he
bears
the
responsibility
for,
if
you
will,
bad
luck
if
the
risk
is
realized.
and
that
is
the
rationale
for
--
for
holding
him
liable
for
discharge
here
without
any
particular
knowing
or
--
or
intentional
act
in
making
the
discharge.
so
why
doesn't
that
make
sense,
and
why
is
that
not
an
answer
to
the
usual
presumption
that
there
will
be
a
specific
state
of
mind
required?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
