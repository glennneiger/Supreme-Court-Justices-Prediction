justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i
can't
get
anywhere
with
the
language,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
i
could
read
it
either
way.
it
--
the
house
language
is
the
same.
the
person
"discharges",
yes,
but
what
if
he
discharges
it
accidentally?
is
the
accidental
case
or
unintended
case
meant
to
be
covered
or
not
meant
to
be
covered?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
don't
get
anywhere
--
i
just
can't
get
anywhere
with
the
language.
the
reason
they
put
the
"is
discharged"
is
probably
for
parallelism.
it
was
a
drafting
section
in
the
senate,
and
they
do
their
job
in
a
stylistic
way.
i
found
nothing
that
suggests
anything
other
than
that.
so
--
so
where
am
i?
sometimes
a
person
who
discharges
the
weapon
accidentally
is
really
much
worse
than
the
one
who
does
it
purposely.
purposely,
he
shoots
at
the
ceiling;
accidentally,
he
kills
a
person
dead;
okay?
so
i
mean,
i
can't
get
too
far
with
that.
so
where
--
so
there
we
are.
is
there
anything
else
--
there
is
the
proof
problem
that
the
chief
justice
mentioned.
is
there
anything
else
you
can
say
to
me,
who
really
doesn't
see
it
one
way
or
the
other
way
in
this
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
say,
look,
this
is
why
you
win?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
--
why
do
you
think
that?
i
mean,
it
is
absolutely
true
that
a
person
who
is
a
bank
robber
and
has
a
gun
and
has
already
shown
it,
and
it
goes
off
accidentally
is
--
has
caused
a
tremendous
harm
in
certain
cases,
which
traditionally
has
been
thought
meriting
a
higher
sentence.
and
it
is
also
true
that
he
doesn't
have
the
same
state
of
mind
as
the
one
who
does
it
purposely.
that
is
true,
too.
both
are
true.
and
so
now
what
should
i
do?
i
know
what
you
want
me
to
do,
but
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
in
relation
to
the
--
i
mean,
you
know,
in
a
sense
it
is,
and
in
a
sense
it
isn't;
same
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
sees
a
duck
fly
by
the
window
and
he's
a
hunter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
another--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
would
you
think
--
to
go
back
to
justice
stevens's
question.
i
would
start
with
the
assumption
that,
normally,
not
always,
where
you
have
a
criminal
statute
and
the
crime
has
elements,
that
congress
intends
that
the
elements
be
carried
out
with
a
guilty
state
of
mind.
i
would
start
with
that
assumption.
and
i
would
agree
with
you
that
sentencing
is
different,
and
the
reason
that
it's
different
is
because
sentencing
often
goes
up
or
down
depending
upon
whether
the
harm
that
is
foreseen
does
or
does
not
occur,
irrespective
of
the
state
of
mind.
so
we
couldn't
apply
that
normal
background
rule,
in
my
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
--
now,
having
done
that
i
wonder
if
the
background
rule
should
come
into
play
once
again
where
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
is
at
stake,
for
the
reason
that
if
the
harm
eventuates,
there
are
many
ways
in
which
the
sentence
will
go
up.
if
this
person
had
been
killed,
for
example,
it
becomes
a
murder
in
the
course
of
a
felony.
there
are
all
kinds
of
other
statutes
that
can
aggravate
the
felony.
and
if
you
don't
apply
the
mandatory
minimum,
the
judge
still
can
give
him
the
higher
sentence,
if
he
warrants
it.
but
if
you
apply
the
mandatory
minimum
where
the
judge
wouldn't
go
up,
the
only
impact
that
has
is
to
take
people
who
the
judge
and
others
think
fall
into
the
minimal
category
of
bad
behavior
plus
consequences,
and
force
them
to
have
a
higher
sentence.
now,
that
would
be
a
rationale
for
a
rule
of
lenity
in
mandatory
minimum
sentencing
matters.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
it
would.
it
would.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
can't
--
i
can't
--
the
trouble
is
i
can't
find
anything
in
the
history
of
this
that
really
says
why
they
use
"is
discharged"
or
used
--
as
opposed
to
"discharges".
and
i
find
those
very
metaphysical,
those
arguments,
unless
i
--
i
can
see
either
something
in
the
history
or
some
functional
consideration.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"carries"
--
what
about
"carries"?
is
the
--
if
a
person
is
carrying
a
gun
in
his
pocket
but
he
doesn't
know
it,
which
could
happen,
does
that
fall
within
"carries"
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
he
guilty
of
the
first;
do
we
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
carrying
has
to
be
--
although
the
statute
doesn't
say
it,
smith
says
the
carrying
has
to
be
in
relation
to
the
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
it
just
said
"who
in
furtherance
of
any
such
crime
possesses
a
firearm.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it's
a
"carrying".
my
--
my
interest
is
the
--
whoever,
blah,
blah,
blah,
for
which
the
person
may
be
prosecuted
uses
or
carries
a
firearm,
or
who
in
furtherance
of
any
such
crime
possesses
a
firearm.
so
i
thought
that
the
"in
furtherance"
does
not
modify
"carry".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
you
know,
what
happens
if
the
person
has
the
firearm
--
he
is
carrying
the
firearm
in
his
pocket
and
doesn't
know
it?
he
picked
it
up
from
the
tailor,
and
now
is
--
is
there
an
intent
requirement
there?
do
we
know?
did
smith
talk
about
that?
i
mean,
is
there,
you
know,
a
state
of
mind
requirement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
i
look
at
smith--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--smith
says
"in
relation
to"
and
so
the
carrying
has
to
be
in
relation
to.
and
since
the
carrying
has
to
be
in
relation
to,
that
pretty
much--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--covers
the
state
of
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
i
got
everybody
mixed
up,
because
the
first
sentence
of
the
statute
is
on
the
preceding
page.
and
if
i
start
at
the
beginning,
i
would
discover
--
of
my
memo
--
if
--
it
says,
if
--
in
--
who
--
any
person
who
during
and
in
relation
--
during
and
in
relation
to
any
crime
of
violence
or
drug
trafficking
crime,
blah,
blah,
blah,
of
a
certain
kind
uses
or
carries
a
firearm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there
it
is
right
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"or
who
in
furtherance
of
such
a
crime
possesses
shall
be
sentenced.
"
okay.
so
we've
got
the
during
and
in
relation
to
covering
the
whole
bunch.
then
we
have
to
read
that
into
(ii)
and
(iii).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
exactly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
we
have
to
read
that
by
implication
where
it
says
"if
the
firearm
is
brandished
during
or.
"
--you
have
to
imply
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
that's
not
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
forget
it.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
helping?
i
mean,
this
did
take
place
during,
and
you
would
have
thought
when
something
goes
off
accidentally,
it's
in
relation
to.
i
mean,
you
know,
i
can
imagine
an
argument
to
the
contrary,
but
it
isn't
obvious.
it
just
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
just
is
--
they
have
"during",
"in
relation
to",
and
"in
furtherance
of".
so
their
--
in
furtherance
of
doesn't
carry
over.
the
first
two
do.
an
accidental
discharge
--
is
it
not
in
relation
to
the
crime?
