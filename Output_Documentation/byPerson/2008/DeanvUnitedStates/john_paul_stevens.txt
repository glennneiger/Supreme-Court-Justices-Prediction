justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
that.
i
thought
that
"or
possesses"
was
separate
from
the
"uses
or
carries".
is
possession
an
example
of
using
or
carrying
or
is
it
as
it
says
--
"or
who
in
furtherance
of
such
crime
possesses?
"
isn't
that
a
separate
--
separate
enhancement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
merely
possessing
is
enough
to
get
the
first
enhancement
of
five
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
relation
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
"uses
or
carries"
doesn't
--
doesn't
necessarily
apply
to
the
possession.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
also
uncontested
it
was
accidental,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
say
to
your
opponent's
argument
--
i
don't
know
if
it's
right
or
not
--
but
that
there's
sort
of
a
background
rule
that
generally
we
assume,
when
congress
prohibits
conduct,
it
means
intentional
conduct;
and
normally
if
they
don't
mean
that,
they
make
it
rather
clear
in
the
statute.
is
that
a
correct
--
is
his
background
principle
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
difference
between
a
sentencing
factor
that
adds
five
years
to
a
sentence
and
an
element
of
the
crime?
there
are
a
lot
of
us
who
think
that
--
you've
read
harris
and
apprendi.
you
know
there's
--
that
there's
some
debate
about
whether
that
really
makes
all
that
much
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
--
let
me
rephrase
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
were
an
element
of
the
crime,
would
you
then
agree
with
his
background
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
the
fact
that
the
sentencing
factor
is
an
element
really
isn't
significant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
would
it
be
a
harder
case
for
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
that
situation,
would
there
be
a
background
rule
that
we
normally
think
congress
intends
to
punish
intentional
conduct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
really
then
are
relying
on
the
difference
between
an
element
of
the
crime
and
a
sentencing
factor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you're
saying,
to
make
sure
i
understand,
is
that
the
"in
relation
to"
language
modifies
both
"use"
and
"possession"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
make
sure
i
understand
your
position?
"during
and
in
relation
to"
modifies
the
first
words
that
follow
it.
"in
furtherance
to"
modifies
"possession".
now,
do
either
"in
relation
to"
or
"in
furtherance"
modify
the
three
subsequent
subparagraphs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
neither
of
them
applies.
so
it
doesn't
have
to
be
"in
furtherance
of"
or
"in
relation
to"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
none
of
the
sentencing
factors
require
that
that
factor
be
in
--
either
in
relation
to
the
crime
or
in
furtherance
of
the
crime?
it
could
be
just
walking
down
the
street,
you
happen
to
have
a
gun?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
sentencing
factors
need
not
be
in
relation
to
the
crime
nor
in
furtherance
of
the
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
does
it
have
to
be
"during"?
it
--
it
doesn't
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
an
"in
furtherance".
there's
an
"in
furtherance
of
the
crime".
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand.
you
are
saying
it
need
not
be
"during"
or
--
you
said
it
has
to
be
"during"
but
not
because
the
statute
includes
the
word
"during".
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
does
--
where
does
the
"during"
come
from
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
it's
committed
when
the
guy
is
trying
to
escape,
and
the
gun
goes
off
accidentally?
is
that
in
--
i
mean
is
that
during
the
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
assume
that
two
hours
later
when
he's
--
when
he
got
home,
he
carried
the
gun
in
--
in
furtherance
of
the
crime.
he
still
had
it
with
him
all
the
way
through,
and
the
gun
went
off
after
he
left
the
bank.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
you're
telling
me
that
it
need
not
be
during
as
long
as
it's
in
furtherance
of.
so
the
"in
furtherance
of"
is
also
incorporated
implicitly
in
the
sentencing
factors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
discharge
must
be
during?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
strange
thing
about
this
case
is
we're
talking
about
a
category
of
crimes
in
which
somebody
mistakenly
fires
the
gun.
that
doesn't
happen
very
often.
the
whole
--
the
whole
dispute
is
about
really
a
trivial
set
of
crimes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
the
defendant
gets
up
and
says,
i
didn't
really
mean
to
shoot
the
guy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
the
case
you
cited
when
you
started
your
rebuttal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
the
antitrust
case?
you
caught
me
by
surprise.
