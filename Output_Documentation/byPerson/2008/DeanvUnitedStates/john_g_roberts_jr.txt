chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
08-5274,
dean
v.
united
states.
mr.
forster.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
one
of
the
stronger
arguments
against
you
is
the
use
of
the
passive
voice.
it
doesn't
say
anybody
who
discharges
a
firearm.
it
says
"a
firearm
is
discharged".
and
that
seems
to
me
to
take
it
away
from
the
element
of
intent
that
you're
trying
to
focus
on.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
it's
different
--
i
don't
remember
the
grammar
too
well.
you
think
"a
firearm
is
discharged"
is
different
than
"firearm
discharges";
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
i
mean,
if
in
fact
the
bank
robber
tries
to
flee,
and
the
security
guard
is
forced
to
use
his
firearm,
increasing
the
danger
to
everybody
else
in
the
bank,
i'm
not
sure
this
statute
wouldn't
cover
that
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
--
your
argument
would
give
rise
to
very
serious
problems
of
proof.
every
time
a
gun
goes
off,
the
bank
robber
would
be
able
to
say
it
was
an
accident.
i
mean,
we
had
a
particularly
klutzy
robber
here
that
everybody
agrees
it
was
an
accident,
but,
you
know,
in
many
cases
it
won't
be
clear.
yes,
i
was
pointing
the
gun
at
the
person,
but
i
didn't
mean
to
fire
it.
it
just
went
off.
and
he's
sad
about
it
just
as
everyone
else
is.
and
that
would
get
to
the
jury
in
every
case.
just
because
it
was
easy
here
doesn't
mean
it's
going
to
be
easy
every
time
to
draw
a
line.
and
it
gets
back
to
justice
souter's
point.
if
you
pose
the
risk
that
the
gun
is
going
to
go
off,
that's
additionally
punishable
conduct.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
my
question,
really.
the
question
is
the
problem
of
proof.
yours
is
an
easy
case.
most
cases
it's
not
going
to
be.
most
cases,
when
the
gun
goes
off,
the
robber
will
be
able
to
say,
i
didn't
intend
that
it
discharged.
it
was
--
it
was
an
accident.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
maynard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
police
come
in
and
say,
"drop
it";
he
says,
"oh,
my
robbery's
over";
he
drops
it,
and
it
goes
off?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
so
that's
the
line
between
is
it
going
on.
but
assuming
the
offense
is
--
the
bank
robbery
is
still
going
on,
like
he's
got
confederates
gathering
up
the
money
or
something,
does
that
fall
under
your
theory
that
the
gun
is
discharged?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
even
a
police
officer
--
the
police
officer
disarms
the
robber
and
10
minutes
later
mishandles
the
gun
and
it
goes
off.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
assuming
it
is.
i
mean,
he
has
got
the
one
guy
neutralized,
but
the
others
are
still,
you
know,
under
the
teller's
window,
and
that
isn't
over.
so
then
the
guy
who
is
captured
already
gets
an
extra
three
years
because
the
officer
mishandled
the
gun?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
probably
aren't
a
lot
of
cases
where
the
bank
robbers
are
such
klutzes
that
they're
fumbling
with
the
gun
and
it
goes
off,
either.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
interrupted
your
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
entirely
fortuitous.
you
have
two
bank
robbers.
they
both
do
exactly
the
same
thing.
in
one
case,
the
gun
goes
off;
and
the
other,
it
doesn't.
does
that
--
does
it
seem
--
does
it
seem
fair
to
add
three
years
onto
the
sentence
of
the
one
whose
gun
happens
to
go
off
but
not
on
the
sentence
of
the
one
whose
doesn't?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
they
both
did.
that's
my
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
both
did
exactly
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
get
three
extra
years
for
having
bad
luck?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
is
this
guy
likely
to
get
life
for
a
bank
robbery
--
the
gun
accidentally
goes
off?
i
don't
know
whether
it's
his
first
offense
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
four
minutes,
mr.
forster.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
08-5274,
dean
verus
united
states.
this
is
the
case
of
the
bumbling
bank
robber.
christopher
dean
entered
a
bank,
waved
a
gun,
yelled
for
everyone
to
get
down
and
started
removing
money
from
the
teller
stations.
he
grabbed
bills
with
his
left
hand
holding
the
gun
in
his
right.
as
he
was
reaching
over
a
teller
to
gather
more
money,
the
gun
went
off.
dean
curst
and
dashed
out
of
the
bank.
witnesses
later
testified
that
he
seemed
surprised
that
the
gun
had
gone
off,
no
one
was
hurt.
congress
had
made
it
a
crime
to
use
or
carry
a
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
any
violent
or
drug
trafficking
crime.
an
individual
convicted
of
that
offense
receives
a
five-year
mandatory
minimum
sentence,
in
addition
to
the
punishment
for
the
crime
he
committed
using
the
gun.
the
mandatory
minimum
increase
was
to
seven
years
if
the
firearm
is
brandished
and
to
ten
years
“if
the
firearm
is
discharged.”
the
question
is
whether
a
criminal
receives
the
extra
three
years
between
brandishing
and
discharged
for
discharge
of
a
firearm,
if
the
discharge
is
an
accident,
we
hold
that
he
does.
the
statute
applies,
“if
the
firearm
is
discharged.”
it
does
not
require
that
the
discharged
be
done
knowingly
or
intentionally.
the
passive
voice
is
discharged,
focuses
on
an
event
that
occurs
without
respect
to
any
actors
intent
or
culpability.
now,
dean
argues
that
the
provision
should
be
limited
to
intentional
discharges
because
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
government
must
prove
that
a
defendant
intended
to
engage
in
criminal
conduct.
well,
it
is
unusual
to
impose
punishment
for
purely
accidental
conduct.
it
is
not
unusual
to
punish
individuals
for
the
unintended
consequences
of
their
unlawful
acts.
here,
the
defendant
is
already
guilty
of
unlawful
conduct
twice
over,
a
violent
or
drug
trafficking
offense
and
the
use
of
a
firearm
in
the
course
of
that
offense.
the
fact
that
the
discharge
may
be
accidental
does
not
mean
that
the
defendant
is
blameless.
if
you
carry
a
gun
to
rob
a
bank
and
it
goes
off,
you're
responsible
for
the
consequences.
a
gunshot,
whether
accidental
or
intended,
increases
the
risk
that
others
will
be
injured,
that
people
will
panic,
or
that
violence
will
be
used
in
response.
it
also
traumatizes
bystanders
as
it
did
here.
those
criminals,
who
want
to
avoid
the
penalty
for
an
inadvertent
discharge,
could
lock
or
unload
the
firearm,
handle
it
with
care
during
their
violent
crime,
leave
the
gun
at
home
or
best
yet,
avoid
committing
the
felony
in
the
first
place.
the
mandatory
minimum
applies
if
a
gun
is
discharged
in
the
course
of
a
violent
or
drug
trafficking
crime,
whether
on
purpose
or
by
accident.
that
was
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
below
and
the
judgment
of
that
court
is
affirmed.
justices
stevens
and
breyer
have
filed
descending
opinions.
