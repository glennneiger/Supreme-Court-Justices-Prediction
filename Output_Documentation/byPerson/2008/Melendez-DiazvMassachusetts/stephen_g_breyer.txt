justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
else?
i
--
i
think
you're
quite
right
that
--
that,
look,
i
can't
find
anything
in
the
history
that
suggest
lab
reports
would
be
admitted
because
they
would
be
considered
being
prepared
for
trial.
but
business
records
are
kept
out.
so
we
have
here
a
source
that's
unlikely
to
be
particularly
biased,
the
university
of
massachusetts
labs.
and
we
have
the
checks
of
the
discipline,
the
scientific
discipline.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
being
prepared
for
this
trial.
so
it
seems
to
me
some
things
go
one
way;
some
things
go
the
other
way.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
the
predominant
things
are.
that's
what
i'd
like
you
to
address
as
much
as
possible.
and
when
i
look
at
the
definition
of
"business
records
hearsay
exception"
today,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
"hearsay
exception"
does
cover
today
some
of
the
things
under
"business
records"
that
would
be
prepared
particularly
for
trial.
you
could
have
a
company
that
goes
and
measures
lines
on
the
street,
or
tread
marks,
or
a
variety
of
things.
and
i
guess
they
come
in
under
the
"business
records
exception".
do
they?
i
mean,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
of
course,
it
wouldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
why
--
and
maybe
you
have
nothing
else
you
want
to
say
on
this
point.
it's
the
same
as
justice
kennedy
raised.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
like
there
are
some
things
going
one
way,
and
some
things
going
the
other
on
the
issue
of
whether
to
call
it
"testimonial".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
have
been
bad
instances.
you
are
absolutely
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
--
what
i'm
trying
to
work
out
in
my
mind
is
not
necessarily
what
happened
in
the
year
1084.
i'd
--
i'd
be
quite
interested
in
your
views
on
what's
a
workable
rule.
and
when
i
look
across
the
country
on
this,
it
seems
most
states
have
worked
with
a
rule
that
has
allowed
the
defendant
to
call
the
witness
if
he
wants.
there
is
not
a
particular
unfairness
to
that.
if
he
can
get
ahold
of
the
witness,
no
problem.
but
they
said:
we
are
not
going
to
make
the
state
do
this
because
it's
a
waste
of
time,
for
the
most
part.
it
just
delays
the
trial,
and
there
is
really
nothing
at
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
i
assume
--
i'm
really
uncertain
as
to
whether
it
has
covered
"testimonial"
or
not.
and
also,
i'm
not
enamored
particularly
of
seeing
on
a
close
question
what
happened
in
ancient
history.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
add
to
me
on
those
assumptions?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
absolutely
see
that
point.
so
that
--
all
right,
go
back
to
the
plea
bargaining,
which
is
your
first
thing,
which
makes
me
a
little
nervous
for
the
reason
that
i
see
this
bargaining
system
as
a
system
where
the
prosecutor
makes
a
charge,
the
prosecutor
controls
the
sentence,
then
the
defense
bar
would
like
to
have
an
added
weapon,
and
this
added
weapon
is
if
you
actually
go
to
trial,
i'm
going
to
insist
that
you
call
these
people.
you
don't
even
know
where
they
are.
i'm
not
going
to
accept
the
lab
report.
and
then
maybe
the
prosecutor
will
lower
the
requirement
or
maybe
the
prosecutor
raised
it
in
the
first
place
because
he
thought
you
would
say
something
like
that.
so
i'm
not
--
is
there
anything
you
can
say
about
how
this
works
in
the
presence
of
plea
bargaining?
do
we
know
any
--
do
we
have
any
information
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
can
we
administer
something
like
that?
his
point
i
think
is,
look,
you
can't
make
any
distinction
either
of
something
that
is
evidence
was
prepared
with
an
eye
towards
trial
or
it
wasn't.
and
if
it
was
prepared
with
an
eye
towards
trial,
well,
then
call
the
person
and
have
him
testify.
that's
it.
and
if
that
encompasses
every
test
under
the
sun,
so
be
it,
because
there
is
no
way
to
draw
a
reasonable
line.
you
start
talking
about
reliability
and
their
amicus
brief
is
filled
with
horror
stories
of
how
police
labs
or
other
labs
have
really
been
way
off
base
and
moreover
really
wrong.
and
you
say,
oh,
distinguish
between
a
police
lab
and
university
of
massachusetts?
try
going
down
that
road
of
which
one
is
reliable,
which
one
isn't
reliable.
how
do
we
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
his
point.
no
workable
way
to
do
it.
there
can
be
horrors
on
both
--
in
both
areas,
and
so
follow
what
the
history
was
where
there
was
no
history
on
this
being
admissible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
aren't
there
some
things
i
read
in
the
paper
all
the
time,
about
these
laboratories
in
various
places,
and
they
lost
the
results,
they
got
it
all
wrong?
that
just
doesn't
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
make
me
think
the
public
certificate.
let's
imagine
birth
and
death
records.
there
is
a
whole
building
full
of
them;
they
are
on
microfiche.
now,
i
am
not
sure
how
massachusetts
works,
but
i
suppose
if
you
want
to
introduce
one
you
call
up
the
--
the
keeper
and
the
keeper
looks
it
up,
produces
it,
and
has
a
separate
piece
of
paper
or
maybe
written
beneath
it
which
says:
"this
is
a
true
copy
of
the.
"
and
you
don't
call
in
the
keeper.
now
that
statement
on
a
piece
of
paper,
"this
is
a
true
copy
of
the
birth
certificate
of
john
smith.
"
that
was
prepared
specifically
for
this
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
take
it
that
has
nothing
--
i
mean
we'll
find
out,
but
if
they
win,
every
one
of
those
cases,
every
document
you
have
to
bring
in
the
person
to
make
clear
that
the
document
that
says
that
this
is
a
copy
of
the
document--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
what
--
is
that
the
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
going
to
work
either.
because
the
person
--
sir
walter
raleigh's
accusers
wanted
to
testify
about
something
that
was
nontestimonial:
what
happened
on
the
day.
so
what
we
are
looking
for
--
i
mean,
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
a
very
peculiar
result
that's
going
to
have
every
public
document
in
the
united
states
suddenly
have
the
keeper
of
that
document
having
to
come
into
court.
on
the
other
hand,
i'm
having
a
hard
time
figuring
out
what
the
distinction
is
between
that
and
all
these
other
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
distinction
with
the
recordkeeper?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
distinction
from
your
own
theory
of
the
recordkeeper?
does
the
recordkeeper
all
have
to
--
do
they
all
have
to
testify
to
testify
that
this
is
indeed
the
record?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
there's
a
hearsay
--
there
is
a
hearsay
aspect.
i'm
not
saying
it's
the
only
thing.
there
is
a
chain
and
so
forth
but,
there
is
a
hearsay
aspect
to
that
which
you
see,
okay.
the
certificate
says
this
is
joe
jones'
birth
certificate.
that's
what
the
--
now,
that's
that
person
outside
of
court
who
made
that
little
piece
of
paper
for
purposes
of
this
case.
and
moreover,
the
statement
that
it
certifies
to
is
directly
relevant;
indeed,
the
whole
thing
falls
without
it.
so,
are
you
going
to
say
the
same
thing
applies,
your
rule,
and
you
have
to
call
the
recordkeeper
in
or
not?
and
i
think
you're
going
to
say
not.
and
if
you're
going
to
say
not,
i
want
to
know
what
the
distinction
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
going
to
calling
in
--
you're
going
to--
