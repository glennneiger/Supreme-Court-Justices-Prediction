mr.
fisher,
i
just
want
to
be
about
--
clear
about
one
thing.
we
are
talking
about
drug
cases
primarily.
but
the
rule
that
we
are
fighting
about
is
not
limited
to
drugs.
doesn't
it
apply
to
laboratory
reports
on
dna,
blood
tests,
all
sorts
of
evidence?
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
very
important
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
schertler,
please
clarify
one
thing
for
me.
is
the
rule
you're
seeking
one
limited
to
tests
performed
by
machines?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
would
you
agree
the
confrontation
clause
would
apply
if
it
were
an
independent
expert's
test
--
test
results
and
testimony.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
tell
me
yes
or
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
we
shouldn't
talk
about
just
machines.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
but
the
rule,
the
issue
is
not
limited
to
drug
cases.
murder
cases,
all
sorts
of
cases
where
there
is
scientific
evidence.
