justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
your
answer
to
mr.
fisher's
argument
that
if
that
proposition
of
yours
is
--
is
--
is,
in
fact,
sound
in
response
to
this
case,
the
state
can
put
in
its
entire
case
by
--
in
a
circumstantial
evidence
case,
by
way
of
affidavit
and,
in
effect,
satisfy
the
confrontation
clause
by
saying,
well,
you
can
call
the
witness
as
part
of
the
defense
case
and
cross-examine
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
that's
what
you
have
got
to
explain
to
me.
why
is
it
an
exception?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
the
--
the
blue
car
going
down
the
street
statement?
in
a
circumstantial
evidence
case
the
witness
comes
in
and
says
yes,
i
saw
a
blue
car
go
down
the
street
at
10
o'clock.
is
that
testimonial?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
distinction
between
that
and
the
lab
report
saying
the
substance
that
was
shown
to
me
which
i
analyzed
was
cocaine,
what's
the
--
what's
the
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
does
that
make
a
difference?
in
other
words,
the
--
justice
scalia
said
a
moment
ago,
you
know,
the
--
the
statement
about
the
blue
car
is
--
is
tied
in
in
the
hypothetical
case
by
another
witness
who
said
yes,
at
--
at
10:01
when
i
heard
the
gun
go
off
there
was
a
blue
car
there.
in
this
case
the
cocaine
is
tied
in
by
saying,
yes,
the
cocaine
which
i
delivered
to
x,
about
which
he
has
testified,
is
cocaine
that
i
took
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
defendant.
there
is
--
there
is
a
temporal
and
physical
path
worked
out
in
both
cases.
and
it
seems
to
me
your
attempt
to
distinguish
them
is
to
say
well,
the
temporal
path
can
be
extended
by
one
more
step
in
the
cocaine
case
because
you
can
take
the
cocaine
or
take
something
from
the
cocaine
sample
and
let
the
defense
expert
testify
to
it;
which
of
course
is
true,
but
i
don't
see
what
that
has
got
to
do
with
the
confrontation
clause
or
the
definition
of
testimonial
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
aren't
you
really
saying
that
the
confrontation
right
is
therefore
not
so
important
because
you
have
a
greater
opportunity
in
the
cocaine
case
of
coming
up
with
--
with
rebutting
evidence,
if
indeed
rebutting
evidence
can
be
found.
in
other
words,
if
--
if
--
if
the
state's
witness
is
wrong,
you've
got
a
better
shot
at
proving
him
wrong
than
in
the
blue
car
case.
but
if
that
is
your
argument,
i
don't
see
what
it's
got
to
do
with
--
with
the
basic
confrontation
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
have
we
ever
had
--
have
we
ever
had
a
--
a
kind
of
lab
report,
public
record
kind
of
case
in
--
in
which
the
record
was
prepared
expressly
for
trial?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
justice
harlan
did
not
take
the
majority
view.
i
mean
you
--
i
don't
know
where
you
get
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
public
record
prepared
for
the
purpose
of
litigation
would
have
come
in
under
the,
in
effect,
the
founding
era
--
or
would
have
been
outside
the
founding
era
definition
of
testimonial.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
say
that,
it
seems
to
me,
because
you
are
--
and
i
think
consistently
--
making
a
distinction
between
credibility
issues
and
reliability
issues.
and
i
think
you
are
implicitly
saying
the
confrontation
clause
is
there
to
test
credibility
but
not
reliability.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
machine
is
reliable;
therefore,
it's
outside
of
confrontation.
and
i
don't
understand
the
validity
of
this
distinction
that
is
implicit
in
your
answers.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
accuracy--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
an
aspect
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
see
any
reason--
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
you
see
any
reason
why
a
notice-and-demand
statute
wouldn't
satisfy
your
concern?
justice
david
h.
souter
a
bland
notice-and-demand
statute--
justice
david
h.
souter
these
other
records,
no,
you
haven't
found
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
you
insist,
even
in
that
case,
on
the
confrontation
right
to
examine
the
person
who
actually
conducted
the
test
itself
and
generated
the
papers
that
the
later
expert
testifies
on
in
order
to
determine
the
admissibility
of
the
--
of
the
--
the
test
results
themselves?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
all
i
wanted
to
know
was
whether
you
were
giving
that
away
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
this.
there
are
--
there
are
--
there
are
three
possibility
subjects:
chain
of
custody,
conduct
of
test,
significance
or
meaning
of
the
squiggles.
as
i
understand
it,
you
have
said
if
the
chain
of
custody
is
established
and
if
the
squiggles
are
admitted
in
evidence,
an
expert
who
did
not
do
the
test
can
testify
about
the
significance
of
the
squiggles.
but
that
leaves
the
question
of
the
--
the
evidence
about
the
conduct
of
the
test
itself.
and
i
understood
you
to
say
to
me
that
you
were
not
conceding
that
you
did
not
have
a
--
a
confrontation
right
to
examine
the
person
who
did
the
test
itself
in
order
to
determine
admissibility.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
