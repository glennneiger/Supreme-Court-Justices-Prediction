ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
confrontation
clause
is
not
implicated
when
a
human
being
merely
authenticates
for
trial
the
instruments-generated
result
of
a
scientific
test.
that
is
because
the
direct
output
of
an
instrument
is
not
testimonial
and
human
assertions
that
merely
establish
the
foundation
for
admitting
nontestimonial
evidence
do
not
themselves
trigger
confrontation
clause
rights.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
if
i
could
draw
an
analogy,
justice
ginsburg,
to
a
historical
example
that
we
think
illustrates
our
point,
historically
records
custodians
--
public
records
custodians
have
been
permitted
to
certify
through,
when
they
have
express
authority
at
the
common
law,
and
--
and
into
present
day
that
they
did
a
records
search,
that
they
found
a
document
within
the
public
records
of
an
agency,
and
that
the
document
that
they
are
attaching
is
a
true
copy
of
what
they
found.
those
are
statements
by
humans
that
really
set
forth
the
conditions
for
--
under
which
the
evidence
is
being
presented
to
the
jury.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
but
those
have
always
been
accepted.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
the
underlying
material
in
the
public
records
case
is
not
testimonial
because
it
was
not
prepared
for
trial.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
we
would
submit
that
the
underlying
material
is
also
not
testimonial,
albeit
for
a
separate
reason;
and
that
is
that
it
is
an
instrument-generated
result
and
therefore
not
the
statement
of
a
witness.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
no.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
my
analogy
would
be,
justice
scalia,
if
that
clock
had
in
itself
a
trigger
mechanism
that
would
detect
when
a
gunshot
was
fired;
and
if
that
clock
delivered,
as
you
have
in
the
cases
of
a
drug
analysis,
a
result,
a
reading
that
one
could
submit
into
court
that
says
shot
detected
at
12
p.m.,
that
that
nontestimonial
evidence
could
be
submitted
consistently
with
confrontation
clause
principles,
but
it
would
still
require
authentication.
some
person
may
have
to
establish
that
this
clock
was
set
up,
it
was
operating
properly,
it
was
calibrated
the
way
it
had
to.
those
all
go
to
the
same
sorts
of
foundational
facts
that
are
akin
to
the
public
records
certificate.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
yes,
justice
breyer.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
our--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--well,
that
is
--
that
is
our
point.
that
it
is
too
--
it
is
too
simplified
to
say,
as
petitioner
does
here,
that
if
it's
an
affidavit
or
a
certificate,
and
it's
prepared
for
trial,
that's
the
end
of
the
analysis.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
well,
justice
kennedy,
this
is
why
i
would
bring
those
two
rules
together.
in
the
public
records
example,
what
you
have
is
underlying
evidence
going
into
the
jury
that
is
nontestimonial.
in
that
instance,
it
was
because
it
was
a
public
record
not
prepared
for
trial
but
has
always
been
accepted
from
--
has
always
been
viewed
as
nontestimonial.
your
honor
is
correct.
in
this
case
we
don't
have
that,
but
what
we
do
have
is
an
underlying
evidentiary
item
that
is
nontestimonial
for
a
separate
purpose,
and
that
is
that
it
is
a
machine-generated
result.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
well
--
yes,
justice
breyer.
let
me
just
add
that
in
the
public
records
custodian
situation,
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
the
public
records
custodian
who
is
signing
that
certificate
was
careless,
is
a
liar;
and
those
certificates
yet
have
always
been
viewed
as
simply
foundational
vehicles
for
getting
to
the
jury
nontestimonial
evidence.
the
defense
is
not--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--the
rule
that
i
have
articulated
so
far,
yes.
it
is
--
it
would
be--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--justice
stevens,
we
also
have
an
alternative
argument--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--no.
i
would
not.
because
we
have
an
alternative--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--well,
we
hope
to
rely
on
one
of
the
same
arguments
that
massachusetts
does,
which
is
that
there
was
a
broad
exception
at
common
law
for
official
records,
those
created
by
public
officers
doing
their
duty.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
i--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--well,
we
have
--
i
mean,
we
have
looked
for
that
limitation
in
the
authorities
and
we
simply
have
not
found
it.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
no.
i
have
--
i
have
not.
yet,
if
i
could
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
there
is
no
record
here
about
how
this
test
in
particular
was
done,
but
there
--
there
--
i
can
tell
the
court
that
actually
technology
in
the
controlled
substance
area
is
to
the
point
where
an
instrument
does
in
fact
provide
an
answer
to
the
analyst.
it
provides
a
mass
spectrum
of
the
unknown
and
a--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--well,
the
--
the
narrower
rule
that
we
are
discussing
here
would
be
limited
to
those
situations
in
which
the
underlying
evidence
to
be
presented
to
the
jury
is
nontestimonial
because
it
is
instrument-generated
and
did
not
require
human
analysis.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
for
the
following
reason.
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
records
custodians,
a
defendant
may
believe
that
that
is
not
an
authentic
record;
and
nothing
about
the
rule
we
propose
would
prevent
the
defense
from
challenging
the
authenticity
or
the
circumstances,
the
correctness
of
the
testing
procedures
that
were
used.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
--
whether
the
confrontation
clause
requires
that
that
challenge
occur
in
the
government's
case
on
cross-examination,
or
as
in
these
record
custodian's
cases,
if
the
defense
wants
to
challenge
the
authenticity
of
the
underlying
nontestimonial
evidence,
he
must
do
so
in
his
case.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
i
would
--
i
would
be
happy
to,
justice
kennedy.
i
--
i
don't
have
information
about
california.
i
do
have
information
about
the
district
of
columbia.
and
i
can
tell
the
court
that
in
the
time
period
since
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
held
that
these
sorts
of
certificates
of
analysis
were
testimonial,
that
the
court
appearances
that
have
been
required
of
dea
chemists
at
the
mid-atlantic
laboratory
have
increased
by
500
percent,
from
seven
to
10
appearances
per
month
to
routinely
over
50
per
month,
and
that
the
corresponding
time
that
it
takes
to
analyze
substance
has
increased.
thank
you,
your
honor.
