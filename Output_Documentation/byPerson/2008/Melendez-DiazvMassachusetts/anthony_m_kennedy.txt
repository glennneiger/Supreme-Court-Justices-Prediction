justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
the
tests
were
by
john
smith,
assistant
lab
technician,
and
you
call
john
smith,
and
you
say,
"is
this
your
signature"?
"yes".
"do
you
remember
doing
this
test?
"
and
he
says,
"i
do
thousands
of
tests.
"
"i
don't
remember.
"
"i'll
tell
you
the
way
i
always
do
them.
"
i
mean,
is
that
what
you
want?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
what
you're
usually
going
to
get,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
know
what
you're
going
to
get
by
looking,
number
one,
at
the
states
which
allow
this,
where
this
happens
all
the
time.
you
know
what
you're
going
to
get
in
the
states
where
the
defendant
--
where
the
defense
can
subpoena
the
witness.
now,
if
there
are
new
tests,
complex
dna
tests
and
so
forth,
i
suppose
there
is
a
lot
to
ask
about.
standard
blood
alcohol,
not
much
to
ask
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can
raise
all
those
questions
from
the
fact
of
the
--
from
the
document.
tell
the
jury,
"this
doesn't
show
what
tests
were
performed.
"
it's
there
on
the
document.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
answer,
you
said,
well,
there
would
be
this
stack
of
affidavits
and
that's
all
the
state
would
have
to
do.
i
think,
mr.
fisher,
that
was
not
quite
responsive
because
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
there
is
an
exception
for
business
records.
nobody
is
talking
about
affidavits,
witnesses,
and
so
forth.
we
are
talking
about
business
records
done
in
the
ordinary
course.
it's
true
that
it
--
that
the
core
principle
is
whether
that
confrontation
is
required,
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
business
records
should
be
treated
as
something
that
are
not
testimony
because
they
are
done
based
on
other
protocols
with
other
procedures
where
there
is
substantial
insulation
from
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
because
it's
a
routine
scientific
exercise.
so
i
think
your
answer,
i
would
agree,
is
responsive
based
on
your
theory
of
the
case,
but
as
a
matter
of
practice
and
as
a
matter
of
the
issue
that's
before
the
court,
i
don't
think
it
addresses
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
railroad
case
was
an
accident
report.
this
is
a
scientific
analysis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you
had
what
we
can
call
an
independent
lab,
that
certainly
--
you
certainly
can
distinguish
that
from
a
police
report.
it's
a
line-drawing
question,
i'll
admit,
but
i
think
it's
easily
distinguished.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
wonder
--
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
if
you
--
if
you
didn't
state
your
case
strongly
enough
with
reference
to
california.
i
thought
california
followed
the
rule
that
you
advocate
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
it's
one
more
witness.
labs
are
backed
up
with
dna.
you
know,
the
federal
budget
for
the
courts,
for
the
federal
courts,
is
$6
billion.
well,
$1
billion
of
that
is
spent
under
the
criminal
justice
act
for
experts
and
translators
and
counsels.
this
--
this
is
a
very,
very
substantial
burden
if
we
tell
every
state
in
the
country
that
every
--
in
every
drug
case
you
are
--
the
state
must
produce
the
expert.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
--
and
tell
me
if
this
is
not
the
way
you
want
to
argue.
it
seems
to
me
to
make
your
case
you
have
to
say
of
course
this
is
hearsay;
and
the
question
is
whether
it's
testimonial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
not
testimonial
because
these
are
laboratory
protocols,
subject
to
ongoing,
objective,
repeated
standards;
that's
different
from
testimony
that
it
was
a
blue
car,
which
is
specific
to
the
case.
that's
the
kind
of
framework
of
the
argument
you
have
to
make.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
as
a
result
of
that
it
is
not
testimonial
because
"testimonial"
is
a
legal
term
that's
subject
to
interpretation.
i
--
i
guess
that's
the
argument
you're
making
and
that
you
have
to
make.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
i
see
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course
the
problem
was
in
--
i
think
it
was
hammond
was
the
companion
case
to
david.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
911
call
was
done
for
other
--
really
other
purposes.
it
wasn't
testimonial
because
it
wasn't
really
directed
to
trial.
this
does
seem
more
directed
to
trial,
so
then
you
have
to
tell
us
why
even
if
it
is,
there
are
some
independent
guarantees
of
--
of
reliability
that
means
that
we
should
say
it's
not
testimonial
as
a
legal
matter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
have
to
have
a
machine?
i
mean,
what
about
--
what
about
ballistics?
"this
bullet
came
from
that
gun.
"
does
that
involve
sufficient
discretion,
sufficient
judgment
that
the
expert
has
to
be
there,
while
the
blood
--
blood
or
drug
testing
doesn't?
it
seems
to
me
that's
where
you
have
to
draw
the
line.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
to
say
that
that
wasn't
raised
in
the
case,
this
is
precisely
the
question
we
are
going
to
have
to
decide
if
you're
going
to
prevail.
i
don't
think
it
helps
to
say
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
are
raising
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
do
wish
you
would
comment
on
the
argument
that
the
state
of
california
--
a
huge
state
with
many,
many
drug
prosecutions
--
seems
to
get
along
all
right
under
the
rule
that
the
petitioner
proposes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
state
of
california
and
other
populous
states
have
for,
i
take
it,
some
number
of
years
been
able
to
function
quite
effectively
under
the
rule
that
the
petitioner
proposes,
it
seems
to
me
that's
something
that
you
have
to
address.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
would
it
be
undue
for
california
and
not
for
--
are
you
accepting
the
fact
that
in
california
it's
a
workable
rule
and
it's
caused
no
problems?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
non-answer.
we
are
asking
what's
the
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
submit
it
on
the
affidavit,
as
the
chief
justice
said
under
your
theory
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you'd
try
to
have
some
different
hypothesis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
have
to
have
some
boundaries,
you
have
to
have
some
framework,
you
have
to
have
some
explanation.
you
started
talking
about
a
machine.
there
is
no
machine
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
so
it
seems
to
me
you
have
two
different
rationales
floating
around
here
and
--
and
neither
are
tethered
to
a
specific
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
do
that
because
there
is
all
sorts
of
machines
that
have
to
be
interpreted.
there
--
a
chromatic
spectrum
analysis;
the
person
has
to
say
what
he
saw
there,
what
she
saw
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
just
because
the
machine
is
involved
it
seems
to
me
we
cannot
make
a
sensible
rule
based
on
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
comment
on
the
california
experience,
please?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
graph,
spectrograph
or
--
or
--
or
the
--
the
chart
is
introduced.
chain
of
custody
is
either
stipulated
or
established.
can
a
person
who
did
not
make
the
test
testify
as
to
what
that
line
--
what
that
graph
means,
and
would
that
be
sufficient
to
convict?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
chain
of
custody
is
--
is
quite
different
from
the
quantitative
analysis
and
the
professional
opinion.
my
question
is
only
chain
of
custody
has
been
established,
that's
gone
to
the
laboratory,
the
paper
is
produced,
an
outside
witness
testifies
to
what
the
paper
means.
i
thought
you
said
that
that
suffices.
