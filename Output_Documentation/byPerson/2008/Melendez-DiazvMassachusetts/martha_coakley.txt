ms.
martha
coakley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
drug
analysis
certificates
at
issue
in
this
case
are
not
testimonial
statements
that
have
been
covered
by
the
confrontation
clause.
that
is,
they
are
not
the
statement
of
a
percipient
witness
who
has
observed
past
behavior
of
the
defendant.
indeed,
what
they
are
are
official
records
of
objective
identified
--
it's
independently
verifiable
facts
that
are
--
that
were
admissible
at
common
law.
ms.
martha
coakley
because
clearly,
the
kinds
of
affidavits
that
are
the
subject
of
confrontation
clause
analysis
could
not
be
submitted
by
that.
i
think
this
is
an
exception
to
that.
and
so--
ms.
martha
coakley
--because
first
of
all,
although
the
court
has
not
addressed
it
so
far
with
mr.
fisher,
these
are
really
not
testimonial
statements.
none
of
the
cases
that
have
dealt
with
confrontation
clause
analysis
--
before
ohio,
through
ohio,
through
in
fact
giles
--
deal
with
the
kind
of
statement
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
it's
really
a
report
of
a
scientist
test.
ms.
martha
coakley
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
martha
coakley
in
the
first
instance
you
have
a
witness
to
an
event
in
a
particular
case
that
can
be
tied
to,
perhaps,
behavior
of
the
defendant
that's
deemed
to
be
criminal.
it's
--
it's
classic
hearsay
and
subject
to
confrontation,
if
it's,
you
know,
is
going
to
be
used
by
the
prosecution.
in
this
instance,
though,
we
have
a
protocol
set
up
by
a
state
statute
that
indeed
does
test
substances
other
than
those
definitely
headed
for
litigation.
ms.
martha
coakley
well,
i
think
there
are
several
differences,
your
honor,
but
one
of
which
is
that
it
is
identifiable
and
it
can
be
verified
outside
of
what
the
scope
of
the
confrontation
clause
is.
in
other
words,
the
defendant
has
a
chance
to
test
it
ahead
of
time,
have
his
own
independent
witness.
this
doesn't
change.
whether
it
is
cocaine
before,
during
or
after
the
trial
is
testable.
ms.
martha
coakley
and
it's
not
true
of
a
witness
statement.
ms.
martha
coakley
i
--
i
think
that
that's
significant,
your
honor,
because
it
can
be
tested
and
verified
and
isn't
dependent
upon
a
cross
examination
at
trial.
ms.
martha
coakley
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
dutton,
for
instance,
and
the
concurring
opinion
by
justice
harlan
talking
about
laboratory
reports
deemed
to
be
whatever
the
analysis
was,
a
business
record,
that
would
have
been--
ms.
martha
coakley
--except
the
public
record,
for
instance
of
a
coroner's
result
--
not
the
coroner's
verdict
that
involves
marian-type
depositions,
but
the
results
of
a
coroner's
verdict
that
says
somebody
is
dead
and
this
is
the
cause
and
manner
and
means
of
death
--
would
have
been
admissible
at
the
time
with
--
that
kind
of--
ms.
martha
coakley
but
autopsy
results
--
my
understanding,
your
honor,
is
that
autopsy
results
--
again
not
a
coroner's
verdict,
which
--
in
the
reply
brief
we
believe
that
counsel
has
conflated
what
would
be
a
verdict
between
the
fact
of
an
official
record,
an
autopsy
report
of
the
death,
manner
and
means
of
death
--
have
been
and
still
admissible.
ms.
martha
coakley
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
martha
coakley
that's--
ms.
martha
coakley
--well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
martha
coakley
and
i
think
that
that
is
certainly
consistent
with
the
way
in
which
this
court
in
looking
at
the
series
of
cases
from
crawford
since,
have
looked
at
what
a
testimonial
statement
is.
admittedly,
you
haven't
addressed
this
kind
of
statement,
and
i
would
argue
because
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
principal
evil
that
the
confrontation
clause
is
designed
to
prevent.
ms.
martha
coakley
yes.
ms.
martha
coakley
well,
i
agree,
your
honor.
i
think
that
you
cannot
pull
one
of
these
qualities
out
and
say
that
because
it's
prepared
in
anticipation
of
trial
means
that
therefore
it
is
testimonial.
there
have
been
several
criteria
that
this
court
has
looked
at,
including
--
there
are
other
kinds
of
analogies
to
this
that
are
akin
to
this
kind
of
record.
for
instance,
in
an
assault
case,
a
gun
which
is
the
real
evidence
--
remember
the
cocaine
is
the
real
evidence
here
--
the
commonwealth
would
introduce
a
certificate
saying
this
is
a
working
gun,
and
that
is
in
lieu
of
the
analyst
coming
in.
when
we
have
to
prove
public
way,
when
we
have
to
prove
school
zone,
when
we
have
to
prove
in
some
instances--
ms.
martha
coakley
--if--
ms.
martha
coakley
--not
to
prove
it's
a
working
firearm,
your
honor.
in
order
to
make
a
comparison
--
i
would
agree
with
counsel
that
once
you
get
into
the
discretionary
areas
that
you
need
to
make
comparisons
and
analysis,
but
this
is
not
that
case.
ms.
martha
coakley
well,
interestingly,
your
honor,
that
argument
wasn't
raised
in
this
case
below
and
really
hasn't
been
raised
in
this
case
before
the
court.
in
fact
this
is
one
of
the
straightforward
objective
tests
that
says
you
put
this
material
into
the
machine,
and
the
solicitor
general
also
deals
with
this.
the
100
percent
accuracy
by
and
large
from
that
result
says
this
is
cocaine;
this
is
heroin,
this
is--
ms.
martha
coakley
--the
interpretation
that
because
of
the
way
that
the
machine
works,
the
chemicals
are
separated
out.
and
so
a
chemist,
if
properly
trained,
can
say
by
the
separation
of
the
chemicals
these
three,
or
four
or
whatever
the
elements
are,
equal
cocaine.
ms.
martha
coakley
well,
i
believe
that
that's--
ms.
martha
coakley
--well,
i--
ms.
martha
coakley
--i
agree,
your
honor.
but
that
has
to
do
with
how
satisfied
the
court
is
whether
here
or
in
other
jurisdictions
that
is
a
reliable
result,
and
i
hesitate
to
use
the
word
"reliable".
i
don't
mean
it
in
the
ohio
v.
roberts
sense.
we
are
talking
about
the
scientific
test
that
is
or
is
not
reliable,
and
therefore
does
it
require
some
other
test,
whether
confrontation
clause
or
not?
ms.
martha
coakley
well,
your
honor--
ms.
martha
coakley
--your
honor,
i
disagree
because
the
issues
around
many
of
those
wrongful
convictions
related
to
suggestive
identification
procedures,
other
kinds
of
issues.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
wrongful
convictions
that
came
about
because--
ms.
martha
coakley
--i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor,
but
i'm
saying
there
are
certain
evils
that
the
confrontation
clause
is
designed
to
prevent.
either
abuse
at
the
laboratory
stage
or
misconduct
by
prosecutors
prior
to
trial
or
analysts
is
not
one
that
the
confrontation
clause
is
either
designed
to
or
is
specifically
very
good
at
getting
at.
ms.
martha
coakley
well,
your
honor,
i
agree
the
chain
of
custody
is
crucial
and
it
relates
to
the
careful
procedure
that
a
police
officer
used,
who
by
the
way
is
the
confrontation
witness
that
you
worry
about
because
the
behavior
is
the
buying,
selling,
possession
of
drugs.
the
element
of
whether
it
is
cocaine
or
not
really
becomes
almost
secondary
to
the
case.
the
issue
is
was
the
behavior
criminal?
so
the
officer
who
seized
the
drugs
is
available
for
confrontation.
the
drug
is
then
clearly
marked
so
the
commonwealth
has
to
create
that
chain
of
custody
for
the
court,
and
indeed
if
the
defendant,
who
is
in
the
best
position
to
think
that
perhaps
this
is
involving
something
other
than
cocaine
or
heroin,
has
all
the
opportunities
that
he
needs
to
make
sure
that
he
gets
a
fair
trial.
ms.
martha
coakley
and
they
marked
it
in
a
particular
way
that
identified--
ms.
martha
coakley
--and
the--
ms.
martha
coakley
--i
think
that
whether
you
brought
the
analyst
in
or
not,
you
would
have
the
same
establishment
of
the
chain
of
custody
and,
indeed,
that
piece
of
evidence
as
to
whether
it's
the
same
drug
relates
to
the
officer
in
this
case
testified
the
packaging.
he
could
identify
it.
it
comes
back--
ms.
martha
coakley
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
issue
between
chain
of
custody
and
whether
the
confrontation
clause
is
implicated
are
different
issues--
ms.
martha
coakley
--i
think--
ms.
martha
coakley
--i
think
perhaps
if
the
court
looks
at
accuracy
rather
than
reliability
and
gets
outside
the
realm
of
the
kinds
of
statements--
ms.
martha
coakley
--that
we
looked
at.
ms.
martha
coakley
but
accuracy
goes
to
what
this
court
has
always
allowed
in
referring
to,
for
instance,
a
business
records
exception
or
a
public
records
exception.
the
reason
they
are
admissible
is
precisely
because
we
believe
them
to
be
accurate,
and
more
importantly
in
this
case--
ms.
martha
coakley
--and
they
are
related,
however,
your
honor,
because
the
roots
of
whether
it's
hearsay
or
not
and
the
confrontation
clause
arguments
come
from
the
same
concern
that
somebody
get
a
fair
trial,
that
he
or
she
has
the
right
to
confront
the
witness--
ms.
martha
coakley
--i
did
join
the
amicus
brief,
your
honor.
i
believe
and
--
though
i
think
it's
too
early
to
tell
because
i,
certainly
from
my
own
experience,
know
that
the
number
of
cases
that
go
to
trial
is
not
an
indication
of
what
the
work
is
that
is
involved,
and
i
know
that
in
massachusetts
it
would--
ms.
martha
coakley
--and
i
address
that,
your
honor,
by
saying
that
for
massachusetts
it
would
be
an
undue
burden
with
very
little
benefit
to
the
defendant.
ms.
martha
coakley
i
--
i
can't
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
have
enough
information
about
the
way
california
works
or
doesn't
work.
i
know
that
as
a
practical
matter--
ms.
martha
coakley
--well,
as
a
practical
matter
in
massachusetts,
it
would
mean
that
district
court
misdemeanor
drug
prosecutions
would
essentially
grind
to
a
halt,
and
the
value
to
the
defendant
--
and
this
court
has
looked
at
in
inadi
and
in
other
situations
where
there
does
not
seem
to
be
the
real
issue
involved
with
confrontation
clause.
ms.
martha
coakley
no,
and
they
often
will
not
stipulate,
your
honor,
until
the
day
of
trial
when
they
realize
that
the
chemist
is
there.
that's
from
my
own
experience
and
that's
a
commonsensical
rule.
the
question
is--
ms.
martha
coakley
--well,
two
points,
your
honor:
in
massachusetts,
we
do
have
a
circuit
court
and
a
superior
court
so
judges
move
around.
and
the
second
thing
is
that
--
my
experience
is
that
defendants,
whether
appointed
or
otherwise,
are
extremely
vigorous
in
protecting
their
rights,
and
if
i
were
defense
counsel
and
i
had
a
strategic
advantage,
i
would
insist
on
it.
ms.
martha
coakley
then
i
misspoke.
ms.
martha
coakley
well,
the
--
the
petitioner
agreed
that--
ms.
martha
coakley
--we
would
argue
that
massachusetts'
statute
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
notice-and-demand
statute
and
complies
with
whatever
concerns
the
court
may
have
about
the
right
to
confrontation.
ms.
martha
coakley
well,
from
the
prosecution's
point
of
view
that
would
be
a
bad
strategic
decision.
that's
an
instance
where
you
would
bring
in
the
analyst
because
you
want
to--
ms.
martha
coakley
--the
rule--
ms.
martha
coakley
--yes.
ms.
martha
coakley
yes,
because
the
defendant
has
plenty
of
opportunity
to
both
have
an
independent
exam,
to
subpoena
the
witness
in
himself,
to
make
sure
that
if
that
is
a
true
issue
at
trial
--
in
many
instances
--
most
instances
it's
not,
but
he
will
have
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine.
