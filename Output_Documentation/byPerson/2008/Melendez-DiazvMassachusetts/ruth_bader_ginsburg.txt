justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
why
--
why
isn't
it
an
adequate
substitute
to
say
that,
if
the
defendant
wants
this
testimony,
the
defendant
can
call
the
analyst
and
cross-examine
the
analyst
as
an
adverse
witness?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
say
that
what
they
call
the
notice-and-demand
type
statute,
that
that's
all
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
--
may
i
just
ask,
you
would
extend
this
to
a
--
a
breath
test,
a
blood
test,
fingerprints,
urinalysis?
all
of
those
would
be
covered
by
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
answered
the
question
that
a
supervisor
wouldn't
be
an
adequate
substitute
for
the
analyst.
but
suppose
the
lab
says:
we
are
very
busy
in
this
place;
could
we
schedule
a
deposition;
we'll
present
the
analyst
at
a
time
mutually
agreeable
to
both
sides,
rather
than
have
the
analyst
on
the
hook
to
show
up
on
a
trial
date?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
only
if
the
analyst
wasn't
there
on
the
day
of
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you're
predicting
that
grind
to
a
halt,
but
there
are
going
to
be
a
large
number
that
wash
out
because
they
are
plea
bargained.
so
they
won't
get
into
the
picture
at
all.
there
will
probably
be
a
goodly
number
in
which
defense
counsel
will
stipulate
that
the
drug
quantity
--
the
drug
type
was
such
and
such
and
quantity
such
and
such.
so
you
don't
know
in
how
many
cases
the
defendant
would
take
advantage
of
this
confrontation
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
if
you
were
just
--
if
you
were
just
putting
in
the
machine,
the
raw
information
from
the
machine.
but
here
what
speaks
is
the
certification
by
the
analyst,
so
you
don't
have
simply
a
machine-generated
result;
you
have
a
human
person
who
seems
to
be
testifying:
i
certify
that
this
is
an
accurate
report.
