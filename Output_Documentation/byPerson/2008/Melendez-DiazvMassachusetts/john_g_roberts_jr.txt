chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-591,
melendez-diaz
v.
massachusetts.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
--
you
say
"the
analyst".
i
suppose
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
analyst
but
whoever
they
decide
to
call.
so
if
you
had
a
supervisor
who
runs
the
cocaine
testing
lab
and
he
is
the
one
whose
report
is
submitted,
i
take
it
he
is
the
one
who
would
have
to
show
up.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
no,
i'm
saying
that
he
would
testify,
i
guess:
i
run
the
lab,
these
are
the
people
i
hire,
they
know
you
how
to
do
these
tests,
and
this
guy
did
the
test.
and
since
he
was
the
one
that
the
government
decided
to
--
on
whose
affidavit
they
decided
to
rely,
that's
the
only
person
you
could
get.
now,
you
could
--
to
impeach
him,
you
say,
well,
did
you
do
the
test?
but
you
say,
well
--
but
i
mean
you
don't
have
a
right
to
an
analyst
at
a
particular
level.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
a
good
defense
lawyer
would
love
to
have
the
guy
there.
the
first
thing
you
say
is:
do
you
remember
testing
mr.
diaz's
sample?
the
guy
is
going
to
say
no.
just
as
was
pointed
out,
i,
you
know,
test
thousands
of
samples.
well,
how
long
have
you
been
working
with
the
lab?
you
know,
just
what
--
what
was
your
scientific
background?
when
did
you
--
how
does
this
test
work?
you
put
three
drops
of
the
acid
in
there.
it
turns
color,
whatever
it
does.
how
do
you
know
that?
what
is
the
chemical?
i
mean,
you
spend
three
hours
with
the
guy
until
the
jury
just
doesn't
think
there
is
anything
to
the
case
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
talking
about
the
defendants
or
the
lawyers?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
we
know
that
this
was
prepared
in
contemplation
of
litigation?
i
mean,
let's
suppose
the
lab
occasionally
does
analyses
for
other
--
research
purposes.
they
get
a
sample,
they
want
to
know
what
it's
--
they
want
to
test
it,
however
they
do
it.
are
we
just
assuming
that
it's
prepared
in
contemplation
of
litigation
because
it
usually
is,
or
--
you
can
imagine
a
situation
where
the
analyst
really
has
no
idea,
other
than
perhaps
supposition,
why
he
is
being
asked
to
test
the
sample.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
question
is
it
could
be
law
enforcement
purposes
to
test
it
for
the
police
to
use
and
educational
programs
that
want
the
rookies
to
know
what
the
cocaine
looks
like.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
we'll
give
you
your
full
rebuttal
time.
general
coakley.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
looking
at
footnote
10
in
your
brief
on
page
30.
and
you
concede
that
some
interpretation
of
the
machine-generated
data
ordinarily
is
required.
now
why
isn't
that
a
suggestion
that
there
is
some
leeway
and
subjective
interpretation,
and
you
might
have
different
analysts
coming
out
differently
and
so
you
need
to
get
the
fellow
there
and
ask
him
well,
how
often
do
you
--
how
often
do
one
of
your
fellow
analysts
disagree
with
your
conclusion?
or
this
is
subjective;
i
guess
some
people
read
it
one
way
or
the
other
one
way;
which
way
do
you
always
read
it?
that
kind
of
stuff.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
go
back
and
read
the
scientific
treatise
you
cite,
but
you
say
some
interpretation
is
required.
so
what
type
of
interpretation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
california
did
not
join
the
amicus
brief.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
it's
the
central
issue
in
the
case?
the
defense
says,
"that
stuff
i
was
carrying
was
not
cocaine.
"
"either
i
was
trying
--
you
know,
i
was
going
to
stiff
the
person
i
was
selling
it
to
or
whatever.
"
that's
the
sole
defense.
that's
not
cocaine.
all
you've
got
to
do
is
submit
an
affidavit
from
the
lab
guy
saying,
"i
tested
it;
it
is?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
ms.
schertler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
is
your
--
what
is
your
answer
to
the
question
i
posed
to
the
attorney
general?
the
only
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
powder
is
or
is
not
cocaine.
you
think
you
get
by
if
the
law
says
you
can
admit
this
with
an
affidavit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
can't--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you
counsel.
five
minutes,
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-591,
melendez-diaz
versus
massachusetts.
