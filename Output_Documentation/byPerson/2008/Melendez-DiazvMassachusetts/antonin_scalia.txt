but
--
but
you
would
ask
--
if
a
supervisor
did
it,
what
would
you
ask
the
supervisor?
you'd
say,
you
know,
did
you
--
did
you
do
this?
can
you
testify
to
your
own
knowledge
that
this
is
what
the
analysis
showed?
and
he
would
have
to
say,
no,
it
was
one
of
my
subordinates
who
did
it,
but
i
can
tell
you
he
was
a
very
reliable
person.
how
would
that
--
i
don't
understand
how
that
would
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fisher,
how
many
states
do
things
the
way
--
the
way
you
would
have
them
done?
i
mean,
how
many
states
don't
have
these
--
these
notice
laws,
but
in
fact
bring
in
the
analyst
to
--
to
give
the
information?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
bring
in
witnesses
if
--
if
defendants
demand,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
fisher,
i
am
interested
in
the
history
since
that's
what
the
court
held
in
crawford,
that
the
content
of
the
confrontation
clause
is
not
what
we
would
like
it
to
be,
but
what
it
historically
was
when
it
was
enshrined
in
the
constitution.
as
a
matter
of
history,
was
there
a
business
records
exception,
not
from
the
hearsay
rule
but
from
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
a
business
records
exception?
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
wait.
you
say
it's
--
that
business
records
would
often
or
usually
not
be
testimonial?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
have
been
nontestimonial.
so
they'd
come
in
on
that
basis,
not
because
they
were
business
records?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
the
two.
i
mean,
the
one,
he
saw
the
blue
car
going
down
the
street,
which
through
other
evidence
can
be
connected
to
the
defendant;
and
here
the
witness
says
this
is
cocaine,
which
through
other
evidence
is
going
to
be
connected
to
the
defendant.
and
in
both
cases
that
--
that
connected
fact
is
deemed
essential
by
the
prosecution
for
the
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
indictment,
not
--
not
as
--
not
as
independent
evidence
in
the
prosecution.
it
would
form
the
basis
for
the
indictment,
as
i
understand
what
the
history
is.
it
would
not
be
introduced
and
--
and
--
and
shown
to
the
jury
as
evidence
that
--
that
indeed
the
cause
of
death
was
thus
and
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
ballistics
as
well?
you
would
extend
this
to
ballistic
tests?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
don't
have
to
bring
in
the
ballistic
expert?
you
can
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
that
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
i
know
i
prefer
one
thing,
the
custody.
it's
very
important
to
know
whether
indeed
this
was
the
particular
substance
that
was
taken
from
the
defendant.
and
to
establish
that,
you
have
to
establish
a
line
of
custody.
and
you
can't
do
that
without
getting
in
the
person
who
did
the
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
says
--
the
policeman
says,
"and
i
gave
it
to
the
university
of
massachusetts
lab.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
"and
i
watched
when
they
marked
it
in
a
particular
way.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
i
know
that
that
thing
is
the
one
that
got
to
the
desk
of
the
analyst
who
wrote
this
report?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
you
can
require
witnesses
to
show
that,
right
up
to
the
analyst
who
did
the
testing,
you
can
require
witnesses
to
testify?
all
the
way
up
to
there
but
not
the
analyst
himself?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
they
are
admissible
in
criminal
cases
as
far
as
the
confrontation
clause
is
concerned
because
they
are
not
testimonial.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are
back
to
roberts
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
these
people
have
to
appear
before
the
same
judge
again
and
again?
the
point
made
these
are
repeat
attorneys,
and
i
don't
think
you
make
friends
and
influence
people
among
judges
by
insisting
upon
testimony
in
criminal
cases
where
it
is
obviously
not
needed.
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
material
prepared
for
trial.
it's
not
material
that
was
generated
precisely
in
order
to
prosecute
an
individual.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's,
let's
assume
that
it's
critical
to
a
particular
murder
prosecution
what
time
the
shot
was
fired,
okay?
and
you
mean
to
tell
me
if
--
if
somebody
says
i
heard
the
clock
strike
12
at
the
time
the
shot
was
fired,
that
would
not
be
testimony?
yes,
the
clock
is
a
machine,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
is
just
reciting
what
the
clock
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
was
not
a
broad
exception
at
common
law
for
public
records
created
in
anticipation
of
criminal
litigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
you
found
cases
where
the
material
was
admitted
as
a
public
record
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
a
public
record
created
for
prosecution?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
they
could
introduce
the
squiggly
line
and
put
on
the
stand
an
analyst
who
says
what
that
squiggly
line
shows
is
that
this
was
cocaine?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
appeals
court
of
massachusetts.
petitioner
luis
melendez-diaz
was
charged
with
the
massachusetts
crime
of
distributing
and
trafficking
in
cocaine.
at
his
trial,
the
prosecution
placed
into
evidence
the
substances
from
the
crime
scene
and
three
certificates
of
analysis
showing
that
substance
to
contain
cocaine.
the
certificates,
they're
called
that
in
the
massachusetts'
statute,
were
sworn
to
before
a
notary
public
by
analysts
at
the
state
laboratory
institute
of
the
massachusetts
department
of
public
health.
petitioner
objected
to
admission
of
the
certificates
contending
that
they
violated
his
right
under
the
sixth
amendment
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
the
trial
court
overruled
the
objection.
the
appeals
court
of
massachusetts
affirmed
relying
on
a
prior
decision
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
which
held
that
certificates
of
analysis
do
not
contain
testimonial
statements
so
that
the
analyst
who
authored
the
certificates
need
not
appear
at
trial.
the
supreme
judicial
court
denied
review
in
this
case.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
the
right
to
--
guarantees
defendants
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
them.
in
crawford
versus
washington,
we
held
that
the
term
“witnesses”
in
the
sixth
amendment
means
those
who
present
testimony
against
the
defendant,
and
we
describe
the
class
of
testimonial
statements
as
including
“extra
judicial
statements
contained
in
formalized
testimonial
materials
such
as
affidavits.”
the
documents
at
issue
in
this
case
were
called
“certificates”
but
they
are
undoubtedly
affidavits.
they
contain
written
sworn
declarations
of
fact.
they
were
made
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
or
proving
some
fact
at
petitioner's
trial,
and
they
are
functionally
equivalent
to
live
in-court
testimony
concerning
the
precise
testimony
one
would
expect
the
analyst
to
provide
if
called
at
trial.
respondent
and
the
dissent
advance
a
number
of
arguments
in
an
attempt
to
distinguish
this
case
from
crawford.
respondent
argues
that
the
analyst's
testimony
does
not
alone
establish
the
defendant's
guilt.
it
shows
that
he
committed
a
crime
only
when
it
is
put
together
with
other
evidence.
that
is
true
as
it
is
often
true
of
trial
testimony.
it
does
not
prevent
the
analyst
from
being
in
the
words
of
the
sixth
amendment,
witnesses
against
the
defendant.
respondent
and
the
dissent
assert
that
the
analysts
are
not
“conventional
witnesses”
of
the
sort
whose
failure
to
be
called
for
cross-examination
at
the
famous
trial
of
sir
walter
raleigh
provoked
the
public
outcry
against
violation
of
the
english
procedural
right
ultimately
incorporated
in
our
sixth
amendment.
but
the
distinctions
between
the
absent
witnesses
against
raleigh
and
the
analyst
in
this
case
do
not
survive
closer
scrutiny.
and
in
any
event,
the
trial
of
sir
walter
raleigh
marks
the
core
of
the
right
to
confrontation,
not
its
perimeter.
respondent
argues
that
the
analyst
should
be
exempt
from
confrontation
because
their
testimony
is
based
on
neutral
scientific
testimony
or
testing
that
is
not
subject
to
manipulation.
it
is
far
from
evident
that
scientific
evidence
is
uniquely
immune
from
the
risks
of
error
and
manipulation.
but
regardless,
this
argument
is
little
more
than
an
invitation
to
return
to
our
overruled
decision
in
ohio
versus
roberts
which
held
that
testimony
was
admissible,
absent
confrontation
as
long
as
it
bore
“particularized
guarantees
of
trustworthiness.”
we
repudiated
that
approach
five
years
ago
in
crawford
and
it
remains
an
implausible
interpretation
of
the
confrontation
clause.
respondent
contends
that
the
certificates
qualify
as
business
or
official
records
of
the
sort
traditionally
admissible
absent
to
the
declarant's
testimony.
but
the
hearsay
--
but
the
hearsay
exceptions
covered
materials
prepared
in
the
regular
course
of
administering
an
entity's
affairs.
it
did
not
include
materials
such
as
these
certificates
that
were
prepared
specifically
for
use
in
litigation.
respondent
contends
that
the
defendant's
rights
are
adequately
protected
by
the
sixth
amendment's
compulsory
process
clause
which
guarantees
a
criminal
defendant
the
right
to
subpoena
witnesses
in
his
favor.
apart
from
the
fact
that
here
the
analysts
are
not
expected
to
testify
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
the
ability
to
subpoena
them
is
no
substitute
for
the
confrontation
clause's
requirement
that
the
prosecution
present
its
witnesses
in
court.
if
for
example
the
analyst
who
executed
the
certificate
is
no
longer
alive,
it
should
be
the
prosecution
and
not
the
defense
that
suffers
the
disadvantage
of
his
absence.
and
finally,
respondent
and
the
dissent
argue
that
if
we
do
not
exempt
forensic
scientific
testimony
from
the
confrontation
clause,
the
criminal
process
will
grind
to
a
halt.
of
course
it
is
not
within
our
power
to
abandon
the
dictates
of
the
confrontation
clause
because
it
makes
prosecution
more
difficult.
in
any
case,
the
practice
in
many
states
is
already
in
accord
with
our
decision
today
without
any
indication
that
the
criminal
justice
system
has
been
impaired.
accordingly,
we
conclude
that
the
certificates
of
analysis
were
improperly
admitted
into
evidence
in
violation
of
petitioner's
six
amendment
right
to
confrontation.
the
judgment
of
the
appeals
courts
of
massachusetts
is
reversed,
and
the
case
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
breyer
and
justice
alito
have
joined.
