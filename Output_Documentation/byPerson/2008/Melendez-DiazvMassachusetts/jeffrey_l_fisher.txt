mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
crawford
v.
washington,
this
court
made
clear
that
the
right
to
confrontation,
at
its
core,
is
a
protection
against
a
system
of
trial
by
affidavit.
it
is
an
ancient
procedural
guarantee
that
requires
the
prosecution
to
prove
its
case
through
live
witnesses
who
testify
before
the
jury
and
who
are
subject
to
cross-examination.
introducing
forensic
laboratory
reports,
such
as
the
certificates
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
the
modern
equivalent
of
trial
by
affidavit.
the
documents
are
sworn
formal
statements.
they
are
crafted
purposefully
for
the
express
purpose
of
proving
a
fact
that
is
an
element
of
a
criminal
offense,
and,
as
the
state
forthrightly
admits
in
its
brief,
they
are
introduced
in
lieu
of
having
the
analyst
called
as
a
witness
to
the
stand.
they
are
therefore
quintessentially
testimonial
evidence.
massachusetts--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right.
our
position
--
our
position
is
that
whoever
the
commonwealth
wants
to
use
to
prove
the
fact
that
they
are
trying
to
prove
is
the
person
that
needs
to
take
the
stand.
in
this
case,
it
would
be
the
analyst.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
took
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
to
be
that
the
supervisor
had
actually
done
the
testing,
but
if
the
supervisor
had
not--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
right.
there
is
no
substantive
right.
i
think
everything
you've
said
is
right
as
far
as
it
goes.
it
just
depends
what
the
commonwealth
wants
to
put
in
in
terms
of
evidence.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
if
they
want
to
put
in--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
if
that's
what
--
at
a
minimum,
that's
what
we
want,
justice
kennedy.
this
court
has
made
clear
in
california--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
we
don't
know
what
we
are
going
to
get.
in
some
cases,
unquestionably--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--but
even
in
a
test
where
the
analyst
doesn't
remember
and,
as
you
put
it,
it's
a
standardized
test,
there
are
still
plenty
of
questions
the
defendant
might
want
to
ask,
such
as
what
test
was
performed?
we
don't
even
know
from
the
record
what
test
was
performed
in
this
case.
what's
the
error
rate
on
that
test?
how
do
your
protocols
work?
what
are
your
experience
and
credentials
in
analyzing
those?
there's
plenty
of
questions
the
defendant
might
ask.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
that's
a
choice
that
defense
counsel
could
make,
as
the
defense
counsel
always
has
a
choice
in
a
criminal
case
to
decide
whether
to
press
the
prosecution's
evidence
or
to
simply
stay
silent
and
then
later
argue
at
closing
the
prosecution
hasn't
given
you
enough
to
prove
the
case.
but
to
the
extent
the
commonwealth
is
taking
the
position
that
cross-examining
would
be
fruitless
in
a
situation
like
this,
the
very
basis
of
this
court's
crawford
decision
is
that's
not
for
courts
to
decide.
it
is
up
to
the
defense
counsel
to
--
if
he
wishes,
to
insist
on
live
testimony
that
he
can
cross-examine
and
then--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
three
reasons,
justice
ginsburg:
first,
if
that
were
correct,
then
i
don't
see
anything
that
would
stop
the
prosecution
in
every
criminal
case
simply
from
putting
a
pile
of
affidavits
on
a
judge's
desk
and
saying
it's
up
to
the
defense
to
call
whatever
witnesses
he
wants
and
cross-examine
them.
but
even
as
a
matter
of
text
and
structure
of
the
constitution,
as
a
textual
matter,
the
right
to
confrontation
is
a
passive
right
in
the
defendant's
hands.
it
requires
the
prosecution
to
arrange
for
the
confrontation,
and
that's
bolstered
structurally
by
the
compulsory
process
clause.
remember,
the
compulsory
process
clause
gives
the
defendant
the
very
right
that
you
just
explained,
that
the
defendant
can
subpoena
witnesses
into
court
and
ask
them
questions.
and
surely
the
confrontation
clause
adds
something
on
top
of
that.
and
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
taylor
against
illinois
is
the
best
explanation
of
the
difference
between
the
two
clauses.
this
court
said
that
the
confrontation
clause
arises
simply
by
the
nature
of
adversary
proceedings,
and
it's
a
--
it's
a
rule
that
governs
the
way
the
prosecution
must
introduce
its
case.
as
i
said
at
the
opening
here,
it's
a
requirement
that
the
prosecution
put
its
live
witnesses
on
the
stand
for
the
jury
to
observe
them.
the
defense,
of
course,
has
the
decision
whether
to
cross-examine
those
witnesses,
or
if
witnesses
are
not
called
by
the
prosecution
that
he
would
wish
to
be
part
of
the
case,
he
can
subpoena
them.
but
we
would
vigorously
oppose
any
attempt
to
shift
the
burden
on
the
defense
to
call
witnesses
like
this.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
there
is
a
variety
of
notice-and-demand
type
statutes,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
the
law
professors'
brief
lays
it
out
the
best
of
what
we
have
before
you.
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
a
plain
notice-and-demand
statute
that
requires
the
defense
to
do
nothing
more
than
assert
his
right
in
advance
of
trial
to
have
the
prosecution
put
a
live
witness
on
the
stand
would
be
constitutional,
i
think,
under
this
court's
jurisprudence.
under
the
compulsory
process
clause,
under
the
jury
right,
there
are
plenty
of
constitutional
rights
that,
with
fair
notice,
a
defendant
can
be
required
to
assert
in
advance
of
trial.
now,
there
are
other
types
of
statutes
that
other
states
call
"notice
and
demand"
that
require
something
more
of
the
defendant,
whether
it
be
that
the
defendant
himself
call
the
witness,
whether
it
be
the
defendant
himself
make
some
kind
of
good
faith
or
prima
facie
showing
in
order
to
have
the
prosecution
call
the
witness.
those
types
of
statutes,
i
think
this
court,
to
the
extent
in
this
opinion
it
would
mention
notice-and-demand
statutes,
it
would
want
to
be
careful
to
leave
for
another
day,
because,
again,
we
would
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
those
would
raise
more
difficult
constitutional
questions.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
okay.
thank
you.
i
--
i
took
justice
ginsburg's
question
to
be
asking
whether
giving
the
defendant
the
right
to
subpoena
the
witness
would
be
adequate
under
the
confrontation
clause
if
these
documents
were
testimonial.
now,
your
question
is
whether
they
might
not
be
testimonial
at
all
viewed
through
the
lens
of
whether
they
are
a
business
record.
so,
as
a
historical
matter,
i
think
it's
plain
that
no
documents
prepared
in
contemplation
of
litigation
were
ever
considered
to
be
business
records.
and
this
court's
decision
in
palmer
v.
hoffman
in
1943
i
think
lays
that
out
very,
very
clearly.
so
there
is
no
historical
argument
that
business
records
would
fit
--
would
be
exempted
from
the
testimonial
rule
as
a
class.
and,
of
course,
this
court
said
in
crawford
v.
washington
that
even
if
a
state
under
a
modern
hearsay
exception,
whether
it
be
a
business-record
rule
or
in
the
state
of
massachusetts's
case
a
special,
brand-new
hearsay
rule
--
just
because
that
might
be
okay
in
the
run-of-the-mill
cases
doesn't
exempt
it
from
the
right
to
confrontation.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
that
is
best
characterized,
with
all
due
respect,
as
an
argument
for
its
reliability.
and
it
may
well
be
that
judges
and
juries
think
that
certain
scientific
processes
yield
more
reliable
results
in
terms
of
reports
and
testimony
and
assertions.
but
we
think,
again
--
and
this
court's
decision
in
crawford
says
quite
strongly
--
that
a
judge
cannot
decide
just
on
the
basis
of
reliability
to
exempt
a
given
record
or
a
class
of
records
from
the
confrontation
clause.
and
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
another
analogy
that
makes
it
even
more
clear
is
police
reports.
police
reports,
just
like
the
lab
report
in
this
case,
are
--
are
sworn
documents
created
by
public
servants
who
are
sworn
to
tell
the
truth,
sworn
to
find
evidence
whether
it
exonerates,
whether
it
incriminates,
and
to
write
up
a
report.
and
i
don't
think
anyone
has
ever
suggested
that
police
reports
describing
a
crime
scene
--
for
example,
no
matter
how
objective
the
facts
relayed,
such
as
there
is
a
blood
stain
on
the
carpet,
there
is
--
the
door
was
wide
open
when
i
got
there
--
those
kinds
of
assertions
would
be
exempted
from
the
confrontation
clause.
it
may
well
be
that
they
are
likely
to
be
correct,
that
they
are
assertions
of
fact
that
can
be
verified,
but
we've
never
understood
that
to
fall
outside
of
the
ambit
of
the
confrontation
clause.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
if
you
had
--
in
contrast
to
this
case,
if
you
had
a
laboratory
that
was
a
private
lab
being
used
by
the
police,
that
would
raise
the
question
whether
police
agents
who
are
private
individuals
but
--
but
asked
by
the
police
to
create
something
like
this,
would
generate
testimonial
evidence
just
as
well.
and
i
think
the
answer
would
be
yes.
in
fact,
in
davis
this
court
already
addressed
the
situation,
although
it
reserved
in
the
footnote,
but
it
assumed
that
the
911
operator
in
that
case,
who
was
a
private
individual
working
for
a
private
company
hired
by
the
--
by
the
police--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
let
me
give
you
a
few
categories,
justice
scalia.
there
are
six
states,
it
is
our
understanding,
including
big
populous
states
like
california,
illinois
and
georgia,
that
have
no
special
hearsay
law
whatsoever,
that
bring
in
witnesses
if
defendants
demand
it.
there
is
another
category
of
states--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke.
i
misspoke.
that
in
the
ordinary
course
need
to
bring
in
witnesses.
now,
that
was
--
getting
ahead
to
my
next
--
my
next
category,
there
are
at
least
nine
or
ten
other
states
that
have
the
kind
of
bland
notice-and-demand
regime
that
i
was
discussing
with
justice
ginsburg.
and
so
that's
another
category.
and
then
you
have
--
since
crawford
there
is
another,
i
believe,
five
additional
states
where
their
state
supreme
courts
have
held
that
crawford
applies
to
lab
reports
like
this.
so
at
least
for
the
past
couple
of
years
they
have
been
doing
it
the
way
that
we
would
urge.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
what
i
meant
to
say
if
i
didn't
say
it
that
way.
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
they
might,
justice
breyer,
and
i'd
--
i'd
be
willing
to
assume
for
purposes
of
argument
that
they
would.
but
to
the
extent
that
they
would
be
offered
by
the
prosecution
in
a
criminal
case,
the
fact
that
they
were
a
business
record
would
not
answer
the
confrontation
question
as
to
whether--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
i
do,
justice--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--but
i
do
want
to
--
with
all
respect,
i
did
want
to
add
something
to
what
you
said
about
the
rigors
of
the
lab
or
of
science.
it
may
well
be
that
those
add
to
the
truth,
the
reliability
of
reports.
let
me
say
two
things
about
that.
first
of
all,
the
confrontation
clause
doesn't
exempt
bishops
and
nuns,
or
--
or
anyone
who
we
know
or
who
we
would
think
just
as
well
would
obviously
be
telling
the
truth.
it's,
again,
for
the
defendant
to
decide
and
not
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
cross-examination
would
be
useful.
but
let
me
add
to
that,
justice
breyer,
that
the
innocence
project
brief
in
this
case
and
plenty
of
other
sources
widely
available
i
think
very,
very,
very
persuasively
explain
that
lab
reports
are
not
quite
as
reliable
as
we
might
want
to
think
they
are,
and
not--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
to
the
extent
that
is
the
prominent
practice,
it's
one
that
grew
up
under
this
court's
roberts
jurisprudence.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
understand.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes,
that
--
that,
again,
it
is
--
it
is
not
for
the
court;
it's
for
the
defendant
to
decide.
we
think
the
definition
of
"testimonial"
generally
speaking
ought
to
be
that
when
a
document
is
prepared
in
contemplation
of
prosecution,
or
more
specifically
in
this
case
to
prove
a
fact
that
is
an
element
of
a
criminal
case,
because
that's
what
these
reports
say,
then
they
should
fall
under
the
confrontation
clause.
and
to
the
extent
that
these
are
in
some
realms
and
in
some
places
reliable
pieces
of
evidence,
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
it's
not
going
to
cause
any
problem,
because
defendants
aren't
going
to
want
to
challenge
them
very
often.
if
you
look
at
the
statistics
in
the
law
professors'
brief,
they
say
in
states
like
california
that
--
first
of
all,
we
have
a
huge
category
of
cases
that
go
away
in
plea
bargains.
and
then
even
within
the
category
of
cases
that
go
to
trial,
it's
10
percent
of
the
time
or
less--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
the
best
i
can
do
to
answer
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
to
say
that
empirically
apparently
that
just
doesn't
happen.
and
i
think
the
reason
why
is
explained
in
some
of
the
defense
manuals
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
which
say
that
if
your
theory
of
the
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
scientific
report
being
introduced
by
the
prosecution
is
correct
or
not,
very
often
the
defense
isn't
going
to
do
itself
any
favors
by
--
by
insisting
that
that
person
take
the
stand,
recite
his
credentials,
recite
the
testing,
and
recite
the
damning
evidence.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
i
would
very
much
resist
that
it
will
always
be
an
empty
exercise.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
as
i
said,
i
think
that
through
notice-and-demand
regimes
and
stipulations,
often
that
is
not
going
to
happen.
but
if
it
is
achieved,
what
is
achieved
is
the
same
thing
that
is
achieved
in
any
criminal
trial
where
a
defendant
insists
periodically
that
the
prosecution
be
put
to
its
proof.
after
all,
we
are
talking
about
putting
somebody
away
for
many
years
in
a
typical--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
don't
know
of
any
empirical
study
where
you
might
say
what
the
price
of
this
is.
of
course,
it
happens
already
every
day
with
other
witnesses.
you're
going
to
have
to
bring
in
other
witnesses,
and
this
is
one
more
witness.
but
again,
even
in
a
case
where
that's
all
that's
going
on,
it's
no
different
than
all
the
other
legal
rights
the
defendant
has.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
remember,
justice
kennedy,
that
--
that
if
you
look
at
the
states
where
this
exists,
that's
not
what
happens
and
that's
not
what
we
are
insisting
on.
all
we
are
insisting
is
that
the
prosecution
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
demands
it,
whether
it
be
through
a
notice
and
demand
regime
or
whether
it
be
because
the
prosecution
simply
calls
the
defense
on
the
phone
two
weeks
before
trial
and
says,
i'd
like
to
do
this
through
documentary
evidence
--
and
then
these
repeat
players
remember
who
--
who
--
one
thing
i
think
it's
worth
keeping
in
mind
in
all
this,
is
that
in
the
criminal
justice
system,
by
and
large,
especially
in
drug
cases
like
this,
we
are
talking
about
repeat
players.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i'm
talking
about
the
lawyers
----
[laughter]
--by
and
large,
your
honor.
they
have
every
--
they
have
incentives
not
to,
as
you
might
say,
yank
the
chain
of
the
other
side.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
the
best
--
the
best
source
that
i
believe
exists
is
the
wigmore
treatise,
which
both
sides
have
cited.
it
says
there
was
a
shop-book
rule
that
allowed
shop-book
ledgers
and
entries
at
the
common
law.
but
there
is
no
--
there's
no
suggestion
that
that
was--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it
is
a
business
records
exception,
but
it's
not
an
exception
to
the
right
to
confrontation
because
no
one
would
have
considered
ordinary
business
records
created
without
contemplation
of
litigation
to
be
--
to
be
testimonial
evidence.
what
we
have
here--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
all
of
the
business
records
that
were
admissible
at
the
time
of
the
founding
would
have
been
nontestimonial.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
in
a
criminal
case
--
well,
the
typical
regime
--
and
i'm
going
to
assume
that
it
exists
at
the
time
of
founding,
but
you
need
some
evidentiary
rule
to
get
a
piece
of
evidence
in
in
the
first
place,
whether
it
be
business
records
or
whether
it
be
just
an
ordinary
rule
of
relevance.
but,
yes,
they
would
have
been
admissible
at
the
time
of
--
ordinary
business
record
like
a
shop
book
would
have
been
admissible
at
the
time
of
the
founding,
but
would
have
not
raised
a
confrontation
problem
even
in
a
criminal
cause
because
it
would
have
been
nontestimonial.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
and
you
can
you
look
at
the
massachusetts
own
decisions.
the
state
courts
in
massachusetts
already
extended
their
rule
in
their
day
to
ballistics
tests,
for
example,
which
are
notoriously
unreliable
in
terms
of
empirical
studies
that
have
been
--
that
have
been
conducted
about
them.
and
my
understanding
--
i
think
you're
right
--
is
that
nothing
in
the
commonwealth's
rule
distinguishes
one
kind
of
forensic
report
from
another.
the
united
states
is
offering
a
slightly
different
analysis
that
appears
to
ask,
to
some
degree,
the
degree
of
interpretation
involved
in
a
given
forensic
laboratory
report.
i
don't
know
how
you
would
administer
that
rule,
but
i
can
say
that
to
whatever
extent
interpretation
would
be
required,
this
is
clearly
on
the
interpretive
side
of
the
ledger.
and
again,
if
i
could
point
the
court
to
a
source
for
that,
the
scientific
evidence
treatise
by
giannelli
and
imwinkelried
that
the
both
parties
cite
at
section
23.030(c)
lays
out
the
mass
spectrometry
way
of
testing
for
drugs
that
the
commonwealth
tells
you
was
the
test
used
in
this
case
and
describes
in
great
detail
the
amount
of
expertise,
care,
skill
and
interpretive
methods
that
need
to
be
brought
in
that
kind
of
a
test.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
the
easiest
answer
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
it's
required
by
massachusetts
law
that
--
that
these
tests
be
done
in
contemplation
of
prosecution.
the
law
itself
says
that
the
police
officer
can
give
it
to
an
analyst,
and
the
analyst
can
certify
a
report
if
it's
to
be
used
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
so
there
is
a
statutory
requirement.
now,
you--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
to
the
degree
it's
not
answer
ed
in
this
case
by
statute,
undoubtedly
this
court
as
it
works
through
this
jurisprudence
will
need
to
ask
a
question
of
common
sense,
whether
the
actors
involved
--
as
this
court
did
in
davis
--
whether
the
actors
involved
would
understand
what
they
are
doing
is
creating
evidence
for
a
criminal
case?
if
there
are
no
more
questions--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--okay.
i'll
reserve
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
to
the
extent
that
the
prosecution
wanted
to
introduce
a
report
certifying
a
reporting
result
of
a
test,
yes,
it
would
be
covered
by
ours.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that
would
work
to
preserve
the
evidence
in
case
the
analyst
became
unavailable
at
the
time
of
trial.
and
then
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
that
deposition
would
be
admissible.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
then
you
--
then
i
don't
think
it
would
substitute
for
live
testimony.
but
let
me
say
one
other
way
that
this
problem
can
be
addressed
by
states
is
that
they
could
have
a
supervisor
take
the
stand
and
rely
on
raw
data
--
on
raw
data
and
give
his
or
her
explanation
of
raw
data.
it's
just
that
the
person
cannot
take
the
stand
and
relay
somebody
else's
conclusion
to
the
jury.
and
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i'll
reserve.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
i
go
back,
your
honor,
to
looking
at
all
the
kinds
of
statements
that
this
court
has
looked
at
within
the
scope
of
the
confrontation
clause.
this
kind
of
public
record,
official
record,
laboratory
report,
has
never
been
the
subject
of
this
kind
of
analysis
and
indeed
it's
not
sufficient.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
the
difficulty
with
that,
justice
scalia,
is
i
don't
know
of
equivalent
or
comparable
records
that
were
being
created
at
that
time
for
purposes
of
litigation.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
let
me
start,
your
honors:
if
there
is
any
doubt
remaining
about
the
machine-generated
theory
that
the
solicitor
general
was
putting
forward
today,
again
i
would
refer
the
court
back
to
the
scientific
evidence
treatise.
the
raw
data
of
a
mass
spectrometer
looks
--
looks
something
like
a
heart
monitor.
it's
a
printout
of
the
squiggly
line
across
the
page
that
a
person
needs
to
look
at
and
then
analyze
as
to
what
it
shows
about
the
molecular
composite
of
the
substance
that
the
machine
was
operating.
we
have
no
objection
if
prosecutors
in
criminal
cases
want
to
introduce
machine
generated
data.
they
can
do
that.
but
what
they
can't
do
is
introduce
--
introduce
affidavits
certifying
as
to
their
--
you
know,
their
interpretation
of
what
a
machine
did
or
simply
what
a
machine
says,
because
there
is
no
difference--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--they
could
do
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
pardon
me?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
my
understanding
of
the
common
law
on
that,
as
the
solicitor
general
put
it,
is
that
that
was
a
foundational
requirement
that
was
not
necessarily
considered
evidence.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
as
a
general
matter,
yes,
our
rule
is
consistent.
now,
if
you
look
at
wigmore,
wigmore--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
trying
to
answer.
what
wigmore
says
is
that
something
like
a
public
recordkeeper's
seal
was
not
considered
evidence,
per
se.
it
was
a
foundational
requirement
to
put
evidence
in.
and
so,
in
this
court's
words
in
the
dowdell
case,
it's
something
like
a
court
reporter's
transcript
that
goes
up
to
a
court
of
appeals
and
then
is
looked
at.
it's
not
considered
evidence
against
a
criminal
defendant.
now,
in
stark
contrast
to
this
case
where
the
document
is
expressly
citing
to
a
statute
of
massachusetts
law
and
saying
this
element
of
the
criminal
charge
is
satisfied.
it
is
a
very
big
difference.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
so
long
as
chain
of
custody
was
satisfied,
yes,
justice
kennedy,
that
someone
could
take
the
stand
and
do
that.
but
remember,
the
reports
in
this
case
do
not
just
report
--
even
if
you
accepted
the
solicitor's
general's
version
that
they
are
reporting
what
the
machine
said
about
the
substance,
they
also
have
a
paragraph
before
that,
and
this
goes
to
justice
scalia's
question,
say,
these
are
--
these
are
the
substances
that
were
taken
from
the
defendant
in
this
case
and
given
to
me
by
this
officer,
and
so,
that
is
additional
information
that
is
being
sworn
to
in
the
affidavit
in
this
case
that
is
also
testimony.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
the
defendant
may
have
that
right.
i
understood
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
to
suggest
that
that
chain
of
custody
was
stipulated
to
or
otherwise
agreed.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
did.
so
i
think
i'm
--
here's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
what
we
are
doing
here
is
disagreeing
slightly
over
where
chain
of
custody
begins
and
ends.
to
the
extent
chain
of
custody
gets
you
to
the
point
at
which
the
substance
is
put
into
the
machine,
and
that
was
stipulated
to
or
otherwise
not
thought
about,
then,
yes,
the
printout
could
be
introduced
into
evidence
and
anyone
could
testify
as
to
what
that
printout
means.
but
to
the
extent
that
there
was
a
gap
between
the
drugs
getting
into
the
laboratory
and
being
put
into
the
machine
by
somebody
that
the
defendant
was
not
stipulating
to,
then
whoever
did
that
--
if
the
state
were
going
to
assert
this
is
who
did
it
and
this
is
the
drugs
that
we
had
--
that
would
be
something
that
would
be
subject
to
cross-examination.
