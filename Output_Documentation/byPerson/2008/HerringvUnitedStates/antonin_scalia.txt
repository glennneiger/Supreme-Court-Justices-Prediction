justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
negligence
is
irrelevant
here.
i
think
if
the
police
department
was
wrong,
even
if
they
had
been
very
careful
but
for
some
reason
or
other
they
made
a
mistake
--
so
you're
arguing
for
shear
causality,
not
for
negligence.
if
negligence
made
the
difference
then
we'd
have
to
go
into
these
factors
that
you
say
are
very
difficult
to
calculate.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
you
were
answering
his
question,
but
you
want
to
answer
it
in
a
way
that's
consistent
with
your
argument
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
injected
the
word
"negligence".
justice
antonin
scalia
alone,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
is
dual
causality.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
a
matter
of
simple
negligence.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
so
i
have
your
theory
firmly
in
mind,
you
would
say
there
is
police
error
even
if
what
happened
was
that
there
was
an
unpredictable
and
unavoidable
computer
glitch,
no
negligence
on
anybody's
part?
the
computer
simply
malfunctioned,
got
it
wrong.
it
wasn't
negligence.
you
would
still
say
that
that
is
police
error,
and
you
would
say
that
that
counts
against
the
admission
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--exactly.
you
give
something,
you
get
something.
if
you
adopt
a
negligence
theory,
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
noose
is
not
as
wide,
but
on
the
other
hand
it's
a
lot
harder
to
calculate
whether
you
--
every
case
involves
an
inquiry
into
whether
there's
police
negligence
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
much
easier
rule,
was
there
a
warrant
or
not?
if
there
wasn't,
end
of
the
--
end
of
the
inquiry.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
probable
cause
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
thought
he
had
a
warrant;
he
had
probable
cause
to
arrest.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
sense,
though.
why
should
we
separate
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
policeman
is
mistaken
about
whether
he
saw
this
guy
picking
somebody's
pocket,
he's
mistaken
about
that,
and
in
that
case,
the
search
is
--
the
product
of
the
search
is
admitted.
in
the
other
case
he's
mistaken
about
whether
there
was
a
warrant.
why
do
you
want
to
draw
a
line
between
those
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
crucial
to
your
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--really,
that
you
--
that
the
police
will
not
keep
good
records
unless
--
unless
we
let
the
criminals
go.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
theory
of
the
exclusionary
rule
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
has
been
expressed
in
writings
in
some
of
our
prior
cases.
things
have
changed
a
whole
lot
since
we
adopted
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
i
think
it's
quite
--
policing
has
become
much
more
professional,
and
i
think
it's
quite
unrealistic
to
think
that
if
we
don't
adopt
the
rule
that
you
--
that
you
propose,
police
--
police
departments
will
just
willy-nilly
not
keep
track
of
warrants.
i
--
i
just
don't
think
that's
true.
that's
not
professional
policing,
and
--
and
i
think
to
say
--
to
apply
the
--
the
severe
remedy
that
you
propose
in
this
--
in
this
area
at
this
date
seems
to
me
excessive.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
they
--
they
won't
know
that
they
are
going
to
lose
a
case.
what
they
will
know
is
that
if
they
happen
to
arrest
someone
whom
they
should
not
have
arrested
anyway,
they
won't
be
able
to
prosecute
him,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
are
saving
themselves
nothing.
i
mean,
this
person
would
not
have
been
stopped.
i
mean,
if
the
difference
was
we
--
we
caught
a
criminal
and
we
could
have
convicted
him
except
because
of
the
clerical
error
we
can't,
but
that's
not
the
situation.
they
would
never
have
found
this
fellow
but
for
the
clerical
error.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
allow
all
of
that
inquiry
every
time
there's
a
motion
to
exclude.
that
would
not
just
be
the
basis
for
1983.
you
still
want
negligence
inquiry.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
that's
a
little
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
if
we
adopt
your
formulation
that
isolated
negligence
doesn't
count,
is
it
clear
that
that's
all
there
was
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
that.
if
--
to
say
with
mr.
dreeben
that
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
today
is
just
unrealistic.
we
have
to
decide
today
whether
we
are
going
to
adopt
a
rule
that
down
the
road
will
turn
every
exclusionary
request
into
a
pretrial
investigation
of
the
procedures
of
the
police.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
a
major
--
major
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
bottom
line
position,
it
has
to
be
a
negligent
error?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
position
you're
arguing
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
adopt
a
rule
that's
only
when
it's
a
negligent
error?
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
ask
one
question,
chief.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
--
your
comment
seems
to
assume
that
these
warrants
just
lie
there
and
the
police
only
use
them
incidentally.
i
have
always
assumed
that
when
a
warrant
is
out,
part
of
the
job
of
the
police
is
to
--
is
to
arrest
the
person.
isn't
that
the
case?
