chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
07-513,
herring
v.
united
states.
miss
karlan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
didn't
they
have
some
regular
system
for
updating
the
computer
base?
i
mean,
i
assume
it
was
updated
at
some
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
people
who
are,
you
know,
the
warrant
is
served,
they're
arrested,
they
go
to
trial,
they're
in
jail,
their
name
still
shows
up
as
having
a
warrant
out
for
their
arrest.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
then,
how
did
this
warrant
clerk,
i
guess
is
what
i'd
call
her,
discover
the
error?
she
discovered
it
within
10
or
15
minutes,
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
did
the
first
--
first
person
in
that
scenario
need
a
physical
copy
of
the
warrant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
was
something
done
in
this
particular
case,
though,
right?
the
warrant
clerk
notified
--
was
it
the
coffee
county
people?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
the
warrant
--
that
the
information
she
had
given
10
minutes
before
was
inaccurate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
it
going
to
keep--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it's
a
separate
question.
it
may
be
an
illegal
arrest,
but
the
question
is
the
separate
one
of
whether
or
not
you
exclude
the
evidence
collected
incident
to
that
arrest.
and
we
have,
in
several
cases,
separated
the
two
questions,
and
i
guess
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
if
no
one
has
done
anything
wrong,
no
one,
why
you
would
suppress
the
evidence
in
that
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
you
have
this
difficulty:
do
we
have
to
get
into
negligence,
or
should
we
assume,
as
i
understand
to
be
your
theory,
as
justice
breyer
put
it,
that
you
would
still
suppress
the
evidence
when
no
one
has
done
anything
wrong?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
just
rephrasing
it.
it's
probable
cause
based
on
the
existence
of
a
warrant,
and
it
turns
out
to
be
there
is
a
mistake
in
the
warrant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
you
would
impose
a
burden
on
the
officer
on
the
street
serving
a
warrant?
when
he
gets
the
call
saying
there's
a
warrant,
he's
supposed
to
say,
"are
you
sure?
"
"did
you
double-check
with
the
clerk?
"
"when
was
the
last
time
they
updated
the
computer
system?
"
"i
don't
want
to
go
through
all
this
if
the
evidence
is
going
to
be
suppressed.
"
at
every
chain
in
command,
you
would
impose
that
burden.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
i
mean
i
don't
know
what
the
situation
is
like--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
know
what
the
situation
is
like
in
dale
county.
they
probably
don't
have
the
latest
version
of
word
perfect,
or
whatever
it
is.
they
are
probably
making
do
with
whatever
they
can
under
their
budget
and
doing
the
best
they
can.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
said
this
wasn't
anything
in
the
record
about
what
type
of
program
they
might
have,
whether
they
were
updated.
they
found
the
mistake
in
ten
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
coffee
county
people
aren't
called
"support
officers"
for
the
dale
county
police.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
you
keep
saying
this
when
you
did
this
in
your
brief.
you
just
call
everybody
"police",
"police",
"police",
when
the
question
is
whether
there's
a
distinction
between
the
coffee
county
police
and
the
dale
county
police
for
purposes
of
applying
the
exclusionary
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
are
back
to
arguing
that
there
was
negligence,
and
that
that's
pertinent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
miss
karlan.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
assume
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that
there
is
negligence
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
ms.
karlan
made
the
point
--
and
i'd
like
to
get
your
response
to
it
--
that
if
we
adopt
something
that
depends
on
the
showing
of
negligence,
that
that
will
require
extensive
hearings
in
every
case
into
exactly
what
their
computer
update
system
was,
and
so
on.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
know
what
the
cost
was
here,
right?
i
mean,
not
just
a
drug
peddler,
but
somebody
with
an
illegal
weapon
found
in
his
car,
a
weapon
that
presumably
he
would
use
on
an
occasion
in
which
it
was
in
his
view
appropriate
to
do
so.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
miss
karlan,
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
the
procedures
of
the
police.
the
officer
is
on
the
stand
and
you
say,
all
right,
you've
been
here
a
while,
how
many
times
have
these
warrants
turned
out
to
be
wrong,
just
as
simple
as
it
was
in
this
case?
and
he
says,
gosh,
this
is
the
first
time
that
i've
had
this
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
cross-examine
people.
these
people
are
under
oath,
you
cross-examine.
you
say,
i
don't
think
that's
right.
how
many
times?
it's
not
that
big
a
deal
to
find
out
on
what
basis
the
arresting
officer
was
acting.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that's
assuming
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
police.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
want
to
arrest
him,
so
they
follow
him
until
they
find
a
motor
vehicle
violation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you're
suggesting
it's
bad
faith--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
they
--
because
they
don't
want
to
have
to
worry
about
getting
a
warrant
that
might
be
wrong?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
was
the
point
of
--
well,
sure,
as
long
as
i'm
asking
the
questions,
you
can
answer.
[laughter]
what
was
your
point
then?
you're
saying,
well,
they
want
to
get
this
guy
and
they
don't
have
to
go
through
the
warrant
or
anything
else.
they
can
follow
him,
find
the
broken
taillight
and
then
they
would
have
gotten
that
guy.
i
thought
that
was
the
point
you
were
trying
to
make?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
miss
karlan,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-513,
herring
versus
united
states.
this
is
a
case
about
whether
the
police
can
use
evidence
they
find
as
a
result
of
a
mistaken
arrest.
the
petitioner,
bennie
dean
herring,
went
to
the
sheriff's
department
to
retrieve
something
from
his
impounded
truck.
an
office
who
saw
him
asked
the
sheriff's
department
warrant
clerk
to
check
to
see
if
there
was
an
outstanding
warrant
for
herring's
arrest,
there
was
not.
the
officer
then
asked
the
clerk
to
check
with
her
counterpart
in
the
neighboring
county,
the
clerk
did
check
and
that
clerk
checked
her
computer
and
said,
“yes,
there
was
a
warrant
for
herring's
arrest.”
acting
on
that
information,
the
officer
promptly
arrested
herring
and
found
methamphetamine
and
a
gun
that
herring
as
a
felon
was
not
allowed
to
possess.
it
turned
out,
however,
that
the
clerk
from
the
other
county
was
wrong
and
she
went
to
retrieve
an
actual
copy
of
the
warrant,
she
discovered
that
it
had
been
recalled.
that
fact
should
have
been
noted
in
the
computer
database,
but
was
not.
she
immediately
called
the
other
warrant
clerk
who
immediately
called
the
officer.
all
of
that
took
place
in
about
10
to
15
minutes,
but
herring
had
already
been
arrested
during
that
time.
now,
when
herring
was
prosecuted,
he
argued
that
the
government
should
not
be
allowed
to
use
the
drugs
or
the
gun
as
evidence
against
him
because
they
have
been
discovered
as
a
result
of
an
unlawful
arrest.
the
lower
courts
disagreed
concluding
that
the
evidence
could
be
admitted
even
though
the
arrest
was
unlawful.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
that
determination.
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
forbids
“unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.”
we've
held
that
usually
requires
the
police
to
have
probable
cause
or
a
warrant
before
arresting
someone.
now,
here,
herring
and
the
government
both
agreed
that
his
arrest
violated
the
fourth
amendment
because
there
was
no
warrant.
we
do
not
decide
that
issue.
the
issue
instead
is
assuming
that
the
arrest
violated
the
fourth
amendment
must
the
evidence
seized
be
excluded.
our
cases
have
applied
what
is
knows
as
the
exclusionary
rule
under
which
illegally
seized
evidence
cannot
be
admitted
in
court.
this
is
a
judicially
creative
rule.
it
is
not
an
individual
right,
but
instead,
aims
to
deter
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
idea
is
that
if
the
police
cannot
use
evidence
from
an
illegal
search,
there
is
likely
to
be
fewer
illegal
searches.
now,
given
that
purpose,
our
precedents
establish
that
the
rule
does
not
apply
when
it
will
not
result
in
real
deterrence
or
when
the
benefits
of
any
deterrents
are
outweighed
by
the
cost.
the
cost
of
course
is
the
prospect
that
the
guilty
and
possibly
dangerous
will
go
free.
now,
to
the
extent
that
our
case
has
justified
applying
the
exclusionary
rule,
we
have
said
that
it
depends
not
only
on
its
deterrent
affect,
but
also
on
the
culpability
of
the
police.
if
you
look
at
the
cases
in
which
we
developed
the
exclusionary
rule,
you
will
see
that
they
involved
deliberate
and
flagrant
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
bookkeeping
negligence
here
is
a
far
cry
from
those
concerns.
the
negligent
error
here
was
neither
reckless
nor
widespread.
not
only
was
the
conduct
here
less
culpable
than
in
the
cases
in
which
we
developed
the
exclusionary
rule.
that
fact
also
means
that
there
is
likely
to
be
little
deterrence
from
excluding
the
evidence.
in
a
case
such
as
this,
we
agree
with
judge
cardozo's
famous
statement
that
the
criminal
should
not
go
free
because
the
constable
has
blundered.
the
evidence
here
need
not
be
kept
form
the
jury.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter
and
breyer
have
joined.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
has
joined.
