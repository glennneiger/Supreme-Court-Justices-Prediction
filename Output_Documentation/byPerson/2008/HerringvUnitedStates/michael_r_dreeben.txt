mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
exclusionary
rule
under
this
court's
cases
has
always
been
a
balance
between
the
interest
in
achieving
some
deterrence
of
police
misconduct
and
the
high
cost
of
excluding
probative
evidence
of
criminal
activity.
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
put
the
error
back
in
the
box.
it
does
not
correct
it.
it
serves
only
as
incentives
for
future
compliance
to
avoid
future
fourth
amendment
errors.
in
this
case,
where
nothing
is
shown
other
than
a
negligent
and
isolated
clerical
error
in
the
maintenance
of
warrants,
there
is
no
showing
that
suppression
of
evidence
will
achieve
the
kind
of
appreciable
deterrence
that
this
court
has
said
is
necessary
before
the
exclusionary
rule
is
applied.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
district
court
did
find
that
there
was
negligence.
there
is
very
little
in
the
record,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
explains
precisely
what
did
happen.
but
i
would
take
issue
with
my
colleague's
comment
that
the
record
shows
that
there
were
no
auditing
procedures.
the
record
simply
was
not
made
on
whether
there
were
auditing
procedures.
what
the
district
court
did
find
based
on
testimony
is
that
the
dale
county
clerk's
office
and
the
dale
county
sheriff's
office
both
had
a
reliable
system
of
recordkeeping
on
which
law
enforcement
could
rely.
that's
a
finding
of
the
district
court.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
i
actually
think
that
negligence
alone
should
not
be
enough
to
justify
suppression,
because
it
would
not
produce
the
appreciable
form
of
deterrence
that
this
court
has
said
is
warranted.
but
i
also
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
not
sure
that
it
won't
affect
conduct
to
some
degree,
justice
souter.
i
think
the
exclusionary
rule
requires
far
more
than
saying
that
it
might
affect
conduct,
and
i
think
that
what
the
court
should
look
at--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
the
incremental
change
in
police
behavior
will
be
modest
at
best,
and
i
think
this
is
crucial
to
my
view
of
the
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
precisely
so.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
if
you
take
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
you
take
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--they
do.
but
from
an
ex
ante
perspective,
justice
souter,
they
can't
know
that,
but
they
do
have--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
souter,
what
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
know
is
that
the
police
have
ample
incentives
as
it
stands
to
try
to
make
their
recordkeeping
systems
as
accurately
as
possible.
the
police
do
not
have
an
interest
in
believing
that
there
is
an
outstanding
warrant
for
someone's
arrest
when
there
is
not.
the
first
reason
is
that
an
arrest
situation
is
a
highly
dangerous
encounter
for
police
officers.
it's
not
one
to
be
undertaken
lightly.
that's
why
this
court
has
rules
that
govern
searches
incident
to
arrest
in
order
to
remove
potential
weapons
from
suspects.
the
police
don't
want
to
convert
what
would
be
an
otherwise
routine
traffic
stop
or
no
stop
at
all
into
a
felony
encounter
that
could
go
bad
for
all
concerned.
second,
there
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--on
the
facts
of
this
case,
justice
kennedy,
i
would
not
say
there
is
1983
liability.
it's
a
litigable
issue
whether
there
would
be
the
potential
for
a
plaintiff
to
show,
as
the
defendant
in
this
case
did
not
try
to
show,
that
there
was
a
degree
of
deliberate
indifference
to
a
need
to
have
a
reliable
recordkeeping
system
such
that
some
official
would
be
personally
liable
for
the
failure
to
have
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
i
think
a
1983
suit,
and
there
is
ample
evidence
that
many
such
suits
have
been
brought,
and
we
cite
cases
in
our
brief
and
the
petitioner
cites
cases
in
his
brief.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that
assumes,
i
think,
contrary
to
this
court's
presumption
of
good
faith
on
governmental
actors--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
there
are
three
reasons
why
they
would
not.
the
first
is
the
danger
factor,
as
i
mentioned.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
oh,
it
certainly
does,
because
it
converts
what
would
otherwise
be
not
a
stop
at
all
or
a
reasonable
suspicion
stop
into
a
felony
arrest.
and
when
the
police
are
undertaking
an
arrest,
this
court
has
recognized
that
suspects
often
have
an
incentive
to
escape
or
to
use
weapons
to
resist--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
there
is
no
warrant,
there
will
be
no
arrest.
and
that's
why
the
police
have
an
incentive
to
clean
up
the
records
so
that
they
don't
send
out
the
police
on
warrant
situations
when
there
is
no
warrant.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
assume
that
the
court
will
make
its
decision
not
based
on
the
conduct
of
officer
anderson
in
this
case,
but
in
an
assessment
nationwide
of
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
is
necessary
because
the
police
lack
incentives
to
keep
warrant
systems
up
to
date.
and
i'm
giving
reasons
why
institutionally
the
police
do
have
that
incentive
and,
therefore,
undertake
those
kinds
of
efforts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
second
reason
is
police
resources.
it
takes
a
lot
of
time
and
energy
to
undertake
a
felony
arrest.
many
jurisdictions
have
dedicated
warrant
forces
which
seek
to
serve
outstanding
warrants,
and
they
don't
want
to
spend
their
time
doing
it
on
warrants
that
have
been
recalled.
similarly,
in
a
case
like
this,
the
police
happened
to
find
drugs
on
petitioner's
person
and
a
gun
in
his
car,
but
if
they
had
found
nothing
and
taken
him
down
to
the
station
house
and
booked
him,
that
would
have
been
taking
two
police
officers
off
the
street
for
an
afternoon,
wasting
their
resources
so
that
they're
not
engaged
in
the
kind
of
protection
of
the
community
that
the
police
force
wants
to
do.
and
the
third
reason
is
that
it
does
not
create
community
goodwill
to
undertake
arrests
when
people
do
not
have
warrants
and
simply
because
of
a
mistake
in
police
records
they're
hauled
downtown.
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
creates
friction
between
the
police
and
communities.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
my
first
answer,
justice
breyer,
is
that
this
court's
exclusionary
rule
jurisprudence
already
draws
a
number
of
careful
lines
based
on
the
balance
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
rule,
to
state
it
simply,
that
i
think
should
govern
this
case
is:
an
isolated
and
negligent
police
clerical
error
in
the
maintenance
of
warrant
records
should
not
lead
to
suppression.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
there
are
ample
incentives
for
the
police
to
attempt
to
correct
their
own
records
such
that
the
exclusionary
rule
would
not
approve--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it's
highly
administrable.
it
doesn't
create
that
many
problems.
this
exclusionary
rule
hearing
is
an
illustration.
the
warrant
clerk
for
dale
county
was
on
the
witness
stand.
the
warrant
clerk
for
coffee
county
was
on
the
witness
stand.
the
arresting
officer
was
on
the
witness
stand.
all
of
those
people
were
asked,
do
these
errors
occur
with
frequency?
they
said:
they
don't;
our
system
is
reliable.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
i
would
add
number
--
i
would
add
1983
possible
liability
as
an
additional
incentive,
just
as
it
was
remarked
in
hudson
that
it
provides
for
additional
incentive
for--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
with
miss
karlan
on
this
one.
i
don't
think
that's
a
fourth
amendment
violation
at
all.
i
think
under
hill
v.
california--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
it's
a
mistake.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
that's
a
very
close
case,
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--what
we
know
about
that
from
this
court's
cases
is
that
if
one
police
officer
has
a
warrant
and
it's,
he
obtained
it
based
on
an
affidavit,
that's
purely
a
bare-bones--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
it's
actually
not
leon.
it's
whiteley
versus
warden.
and
i'm
positing
a
warrant
that
was
completely
based
on
a
bare-bones
affidavit.
so
it
would
not
pass
the
leon
test.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
it's
so
clear
from
this
court's
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
not
in
this
court.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
not
so
aware
that
there
are
so
many
of
them
in
the
lower
courts
where
it's
negligence.
most
often
the
kind
of
mistakes
that's
made,
the
courts
say
it's
within
the
realm
of
probable
cause
if
it's
a
reasonable
mistake.
if
it's
an
unreasonable
mistake,
negligent
mistake,
i
would
be
prepared
to
say
that
the
lower
courts
are
probably
today
suppressing.
and
this
court
doesn't
have
to
decide
whether
that's
correct
in
order
to
decide
this
case.
this
case--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
use
the
word
"good
faith".
the
court
used
the
words
"good
faith"
in
leon.
it's
repeated
it
in
all
of
its
so-called
good
faith
exclusionary
rule
exceptions.
we're
talking
about
an
objective
rule,
and
the
line
that
i
think
that
the
court
should
draw
today
is
between
isolated
negligent
errors
and
errors
that
result
from
a
more
systematic
or
widespread
pattern,
the
kind
that
justice
o'connor
referred
to
in
her
concurrence
in
arizona
v.
evans.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
want
it.
i'm
saying
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
the
issue
today
of
whether
a
widespread
pattern
of
errors
or
complete
neglect--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
that's
not
to
say--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that's
a
very
different
--
well,
whether
it
violates
the
fourth
amendment
or
not
would
turn
on
whether
there
is
in
fact
probable
cause.
if
there
is
no
probable
cause,
and
i
understood
your
question,
justice
souter--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
it's
simply
a
different
inquiry,
justice
souter,
because,
as
i
tried
to
explain,
in
this
area
the
court
can
note
a
number
of
incentives
that
law
enforcement
has
to
keep
its
warrant
databases
accurate
and
up
to
speed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
my
experience,
justice
stevens,
not
that
frequently.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
that
the
practical
importance
of
it
and
the
legal
importance
of
it
is
what,
kind
of
a
balance
is
the
court
going
to
strike
under
the
exclusionary
rule.
we
heard
a
lot
from
petitioner
today
about
how
the
exclusionary
rule
would
help
make
police
engage
in
better
practices.
we
heard
nothing
about
the
costs
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
compared
to,
for
example,
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--some
in
the
lower
courts
have
involved
violent
crime,
and
i
think
this
case
would
look
and
feel
very
different
if
evidence
of
a
murder
had
been
discovered
in
the
car.
and
that
just
accentuates
the
point
that
the
exclusionary
rule
comes
with
a
price
to
society.
it's
not
free.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that's
all
that
the
district
court
found.
the
district
court
had
evidence
and
made
a
finding
that
there
was
no
pattern
of
violations
like
this,
that
the
system
of
recordkeeping
was
generally
reliable.
this
is
the
findings
of
the
district
court
that
are
on
page
17a
and
18a
of
the
petitioner
appendix.
the
district
court
concluded:
"there
is
no
credible
evidence
of
routine
problems
with
disposing
of
recalled
warrants
and
the
warrant
clerk
herself
could
not
recall
other
instances
like
this.
"
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there
was
no
record
made
whatsoever
on
what
alabama's
overall--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--unless
--
if
the
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
going
to
function
differently
on
a
state
by
state
basis
depending
on
the
statewide
error
rate,
which
i
think
is
an
unusual
thing
for
the
court
to
do--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--upon
a
--
not
just
upon
a
showing
of
an
error
rate,
but
upon
a
showing
that
a
particular
recordkeeping
system
that
produced
an
error
was
conducted
in
a
manner
so
that
you
could
say
much
more
than
negligence
was
involved
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
you
do.
i
would
concede
you
have
a
good
prima
facie
case.
i
would
want
to
know
more
to
know
what
that
really
means
because
with
a
lot
of
these
statistics--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
the
court
adopts
a
rule
that
says
that
a
showing
of
more
than
isolated
negligence
would
justify
suppression,
you're
correct.
i
would
note,
though,
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
i
think
i
clarified
to
justice
scalia
that
i
think
all
the
court
needs
to
decide
today
is
that
an
isolated
negligent
error
in
police
recordkeeping
should
not
result
in
suppression.
it
should
not
hold
today
because
it's
not
confronted
with
today--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
would
reserve
the
right
to
argue
that
the
exclusionary
rule's
costs
outweigh
its
benefits
even
if
that
is
shown
in
a
particular
case
because
there
are
a
myriad
of
other
reasons
why
the
police
would
have
an
incentive
to
improve
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
manifested
in
it
every
case
in
which
reliable
probative
evidence
is
suppressed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think,
justice
souter,
that
the
court
has
ever
looked
for
an
empirical
count
of
how
many
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
the
court
wants
one
in
order
to
justify
the
exclusionary
rule,
then
it
probably
needs
to
go
back
to
scratch
and
start
all
over
again.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
will
say
this,
justice
souter.
if
the
cost
is
very
low
because
very
few
cases
result
in
suppression,
then
deterrence
is
also
very
low
because
there
are
very
few
cases
in
which
evidence
is
being
suppressed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
my
argument
today
does
not
require
the
court
to
take
that
step
at
all
because
this
is
an
area
in
which
there
is
a
local
geography
of
incentives
pertaining
to
the
accuracy
of
warrants
that
allows
the
court
to
conduct
the
balance
in
a
way
distinct
from
what
it
might
do
if
it's
confronted
with
police
negligence
or
if
it's
confronted
with
a
widespread
pattern
of
negligence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
but
i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
form
of
looking
at
the
question
has
been
rejected
in
this
court's
cases
that
have
recognized
that
the
exclusionary
rule
has
to
pay
its
way
because
in
every
case
in
which
it
results
in
suppression
there
is
a
cost
to
society
and
the
benefit
therefore
needs
to
be
appreciable
and
this
court
needs
to
be
confident
of
that
before
it
concludes
that
what
the
court
called
the
"massive
remedy
of
exclusion"
is
applied
in
any
particular
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
and
this
arrest
itself
could
have
turned
into
a
volatile
arrest
so
there
was
benefit
in
this
very
case
and
cost
if
the
evidence
is
suppressed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
that's
correct,
justice
souter,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
in
which
the
court
has
said
the
exclusionary
rule
has
costs
and
now
we
need
to
see
the
numbers
of
statistically
how
many
cases
result
in
suppression.
i'm
just
not
aware
of
any
case
in
which
the
court
has
done
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
souter
what
my
case
comes
down
to
today
i
believe
is
the
proposition
that
when
we
are
talking
about
clerical
errors
made
by
the
police,
there
are
ample
incentives
for
the
police
not
to
make
those
clerical
errors
that
i've
described
earlier,
such
that
the
incremental
benefit
of
the
exclusionary
rule
which
we
know
has
a
cost;
it
has
a
tangible
cost
in
every
case
in
which
it's
applied;
does
not
pay
its
own
way.
in
other
words,
there
is
not
sufficient
incremental
deterrence
to
warrant
taking
an
isolated
negligent
error
in
a
generally
reliable
system
and
saying
we
need
to
suppress
evidence
anyway;
and
petitioner's
argument
goes
farther
than
the
isolated
negligent
error
case.
it
says
even
if
the
police
have
driven
the
error
rate
down
as
low
as
it's
humanly
possible
by
committing
mass
amounts
of
are
resources
to
warrant
database
systems
in
order
to
avoid
suppression,
which
is
what
the
petitioner's
theory
posits,
you
should
still
suppress;
and
that
seems
to
me
nothing
other
than
the
return
to
the
theory
when
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
suppression
automatically
follows;
and
this
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
it
does
matter,
justice
ginsburg,
because
the
police
officers
that
i'm
familiar
with
and
the
agencies
that
i'm
familiar
with
as
exemplified
by
the
ncic
which
is
the
national
database,
says
that
the
last
thing
that
we
want
to
do
is
send
officers
mistakenly
out
on
a
felony
arrest
where
they
are
going
to
be
placed
in
a
potentially
dangerous
situation
spending
community
police
resources
to
arrest
somebody
who
should
not
be
arrested.
this
is
not
what
they
want
to
do.
they
have
a
good
reason
to
avoid
being
placed
in
that
situation
and
i
would
caution
the
court
against
relying
on
a
13
percent
figure
in
a
study
that's
submitted
in
a
brief
to
this
court
for
the
first
time
without
any
kind
of
adversarial
testing.
that
is
not
i
this
think
a
reliable
basis
for
the
court
to
infer
that
this
particular
police
department
had
that
kind
of
an
error
rate
or
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
necessary
to
prevent
it
from
having
that
kind
of
an
error
rate
or
even
that
there
were
no
procedures
in
place
to
prevent
errors
and
warrants
from
remaining
in
the
system.
the
record
simply
doesn't
show
that.
the
warrant
clerks
were
on
the
stand
and
neither
party
asked
them
the
question
so
this
court
doesn't
have
the
information
to
say
today
was
there
a
system
that
would
have
ferreted
this
out.
we
know
that
if
there
was
it
failed
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
kennedy;
the
court
did
just
that
and
it
began
with
the
outset
that
the
massive
remedy
of
suppression
of
evidence
is
a
high
social
cost
that
should
not
be
borne
by
society,
not
just
the
police,
by
all
of
us,
unless
appreciable
deterrence
will
result
as
a
benefit;
and
the
court
then
examined
the
incentives
that
the
police
had
not
to
make
illegal
no-knock
entries
and
to
add
that
whatever
incremental
benefit
there
might
be
from
exclusion
was
not
justified
in
light
of
the
possibility
of
198e
liability
and
the
increased
professionalism
of
the
police
which
has
made
it
less
necessary
to
make
the
exclusionary
rule
a
remedy
of
first
resort
rather
than
last
resort.
while
this
court
could
conceptualize
the
case
as
one
in
which
the
government
is
looking
for
an
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
i
think
it's
more
accurately
one
where
the
court
should
extend
the
exclusionary
rule
to
cover
negligent
police
clerical
errors.
for
the
first
time,
at
this
day
and
age
when
1983
recoveries
have
become
effective--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no
one
knows,
justice
ginsburg,
because
a
great
many
of
these
cases
will
settle
out
of
court,
but
our
brief
does
provide
examples
of
conduct
that
was
more
serious
and
more
egregious
than
anything
involved
in
this
case
resulting
in
situations
where
courts
denied
summary
judgments
to
the
defendants
and
ordered
the
cases
to
go
to
trial.
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
in
a
case
like
this
--
may
i
complete
the
answer
--
there
should
be
a
1983
remedy,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
civil
remedies
will
provide
incentives
to
the
police
to
avoid
the
bog
of
litigation
by
putting
into
place
systems
that
will
prevent
this
kind
of
error.
