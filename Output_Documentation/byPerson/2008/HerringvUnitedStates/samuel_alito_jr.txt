justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
your
argument
depend
on
the
quality
of
the
recordkeeping
in
this
particular
department?
i
thought
your
argument
would
apply
even
if
this
department
had
excellent
recordkeeping
procedures
but
nevertheless
made
a
mistake
in
this
instance.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you're
not
asking
for
arizona
v.
evans
to
be
overruled
are
you.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
none
of
that
matters
for
your
argument,
does
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
want
to
make
it
--
you
want
to
draw
a
clear
line
between
errors
by
--
by
clerical
court
employees
versus
errors
by
police
employees.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
expeditious
would
it
be
--
suppose
there's
negligence
on
the
part
of
both
a
court
employee
and
a
police
department
employee.
what
is
the
judge
supposed
to
do
in
deciding
the
suppression
motion?
is
this
a
comparative
negligence
determination.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
are
--
how
are
you
going
to
determine
whether
there's
error
without
determining
whether
there's
negligence?
suppose
the
court
clerk
calls
up
the
police
department
and
says
the
warrant
is
still
outstanding,
and
in
fact
it's
not.
and
it
sends
them
over
a
physical
copy
of
a
warrant,
but
that
warrant
has
been
withdrawn.
now,
the
police
could
always
take
additional
steps:
they
could
send
someone
over
to
check
the
records,
to
look
at
the
court
docket
to
make
sure
that
the
warrant
had
not
been
withdrawn.
so
there
would
be
causality,
but
it
would
not
determine
what
they
should--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
their
duty
was.
how
are
you
going
to
determine
where
this
error
should
be
--
should
be
assigned?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
give
you
another
example.
suppose
that
the
court
clerk
calls
up
and
says
--
it
leaves
a
message,
gives
a
message
to
somebody
in
the
police
department.
and
they
memorialize
that,
and
they
say
"called
up".
and
let's
say
the
warrant
number
is
the
same
as
the
docket
number
of
this
case.
so
the
court
employee
says
--
writes
down
"called
up",
says,
"warrant
quashed
in
warrant,
in
case
07-513.
"
the
court
--
the
police
department
has
a
record
of
the
call,
and
they
say,
"received
call
from
court
clerk.
"
"warrant
to
be
quashed.
"
"warrant
quashed
in
case
07-531.
"
and
so
the
513
is
not
quashed;
the
person
is
arrested.
now,
who
caused
that?
you
have
to
have
a
hearing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
you
know
that
the
police
department
wrote
down
the
wrong
number?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
you
know
what
number
was--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
what's
the
justification
for
drawing
a
distinction
between
a
court
employee
and
everybody
who
works
for
the
police
department?
suppose
the
person
who
makes
the
mistake
in
the
police
department
is
a
--
a
person
who
holds
a
unionized
position
where
advancement
is
based
purely
on
seniority,
or
it's
a
civil
service
position
where
the
person
is
--
is
totally
protected
from
any
sort
of
adverse
job
consequences
as
a
result
of
displeasure
about
or
pleasure
about
how
the
job
is
being
--
being
performed.
and
what's
the
justification
for
drawing
a
distinction
between
errors
committed
by
those
two
employees
just
based
on
where
they
fit
in
the
organizational
box?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
it's
not
a
police
officer;
it
is
not
a
law
enforcement
officer?
it
is
a
clerical
employee,
or
it's
a
computer
guy.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
your
rule
also
going
to
require
hearings.
if
negligence
is
required--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you
are
going
to
have
to
have
a
hearing
on
whether
there
was
negligence.
and
if
so,
who
was
negligent.
if
only
causation
is
required,
you're
going
to
have
to
have
a
hearing
on
who
caused
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
will
that
be
the
case
in
every
instance?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
you
know
that?
what
basis
do
you
have
for
saying
that?
how
many
of
these
hearings
have
you
examined?
