m.

let's
just
assume
the
hypothetical
--
the
hypothetical:
the
computer
malfunctions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
sure
a
computer
might
be
compared
to
god,
but
let's
----
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
want
an
answer--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
want
an
answer
to
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
no
one
did
anything
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
this
bears
on
the
fact
of
why
are
we
doing
this
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
1983
violation
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
if
the
concern
were
that
the
police
would
become
sloppy,
then
a
1983
suit
would
be
more
likely?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there
are
three
reasons.
one
is
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
arrests,
so
they
don't
have
the
hazard
of
felony
arrests.
number
two
is?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
there
were
pervasive
deficiencies,
i
assume
that's
exactly
what
we
would
inquire
about
under
1983?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
would
you
add
1983
as
number
four
to
your
list?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
use
the
word
or
the
phrase
"good
faith"
in
writing
the
opinion
if
we
write
it
your
way?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
hudson
versus
michigan,
didn't
the
court
engage
in
a
very
broad
balancing
of
the
social
costs
and
the
potential
for
increase
in
violations
in
saying
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
the
suppression
rule
in
the
no-knock
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
definition
of
negligence
is
that
he
was
not
objectively
reasonable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
that
--
but
in
that
hypothetical
i
think
it
might
be
easy
to
say
that
the
policeman
on
the
beat
was
not
objectively
reasonable
in
relying.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
certainly
not
the
case
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it
were
an
agency
like
ins
or
customs
in
which
they
have
many
people
that
are
not
sworn
officers
or
some
that
are,
does
it
make
a
difference
who
answered
the
phone?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
rand
we
said
this
is
exactly
the
inquiry
we
are
not
going
to
make.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
rand
was
where
we
had
a
traffic
stop
made
by
a
narcotics
officer.
and
the
question
was,
well,
he
was
going
outside
his
jurisdiction.
we
said
we
are
not
going
to
get
into
the
way
police
departments
are
organized.
we
are
just
not
going
to
do
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
rand.
