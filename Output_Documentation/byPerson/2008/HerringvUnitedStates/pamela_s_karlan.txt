ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
february
2004,
the
dale
county
circuit
clerk
told
the
local
sheriff's
department
that
the
court
was
recalling
a
warrant
that
had
been
issued
earlier
for
petitioner's
arrest.
having
received
that
notice,
someone
in
the
sheriff's
department
physically
removed
the
warrant
from
the
file
and
physically
took
the
warrant
back
to
the
court
clerk's
office.
but
no
one
either
then
or
later
in
the
sheriff's
department
ever
updated
the
computer
file
to
indicate
that
the
record
had
--
that
the
warrant
had
been
recalled.
as
a
result
of
that
police
department
error,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
subject
to
a
warrantless
arrest
for
which
there
was
no
probable
cause
five
months
later.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
your
honor.
there
was
no
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
this
department
ever
does,
for
example,
what
the
fbi
does,
which
is
to
conduct
periodic
audits.
had
they
conducted
one,
they
would
have
discovered
almost
instantly
what
they
discovered
five
months
later,
which
was
there
was
no
warrant
in
this
case.
so
this--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--we
don't
know,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
this
is
a
department
that
as
far
as
the
record
reflects
conducts
no
audits
of
any
kind
to
update
its
files.
and
if
you
look
at
page
41
and
page
60
of
the
joint
appendix,
one
of
the
things
you'll
discover
about
this
department
is
that
everyone
in
the
department
has
access
to
the
physical
place
warrants
are
kept.
they're
kept
in
several
different
places
in
the
office.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
she
discovered
it
because
what
happened
is
a
clerk
in
another
police
department
called
and
said,
is
there
a
warrant
for
petitioner's
arrest.
she
looked
at
the
computer
list
on
her
computer
and
said
yes.
then
this
other
warrant
clerk
said,
please
fax
us
a
physical
copy
of
the
warrant.
so
she
went
to
the
file
where
the
warrant
should
have
been.
it
wasn't
there.
she
went
to
another
file.
the
warrant
wasn't
there.
she
then
called
the
court
clerk's
office
and
discovered
that
they
had
recalled
the
warrant
which
was
back
in
their
records
five
months
earlier.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
the
record
doesn't
reflect
that,
but
she
simply
i
guess
wanted
to
verify
that
there
actually
was
a
warrant
because
they
were
picking
petitioner
up
in
a
different
county.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct,
justice
alito.
our
view
is,
just
as
is
true
with
respect
to
probable
cause,
the
fact
that
99
percent
of
a
department's
arrests
are
with
probable
cause
doesn't
mean
that
when
they
arrest
someone
without
probable
cause
you
say,
well,
you
get
one
bite
at
the
apple
or
a
sort
of
"good
enough
for
government
work"
theory.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
we're
asking
to
you
apply
arizona
v.
evans.
and
if
i
could
give
an
answer
to
the
question
the
chief
justice
was
asking
earlier
that
comes
from
arizona
v.
evans,
what
happened
in
arizona
v.
evans
--
and
justice
stevens
mentions
this
in
his
dissent
there
--
is
the
clerk
discovered
there,
the
court
clerk
discovered,
that
the
warrant
that
had
been,
that
she
had
verified,
had
in
fact
been
recalled.
and
so
what
they
instantly
did
is
they
checked
their
files,
and
they
discovered
four
other
warrants
from
that
same
day
that
had
been
recalled
but
that
were
still
in
their
files.
here
we
didn't
have
anything
done
after
they
discovered
the
error.
they
discovered
this
error
and,
as
they
say,
have
gone
on
their
merry
way.
there's
nothing
in
this
record--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
that
indicates
part
of
what
we're
concerned
about
here,
which
is
this
is
a
department
that
was
built
for
speed,
not
for
accuracy.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
oh,
no.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
we
think
that's
the
most
workable
argument,
because
what
we
want
is
a
system
in
which
suppression
hearings
can
be
conducted
expeditiously
based
on
the
facts
of
particular
cases.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
don't
think
it
would
be
exactly
a
comparative
negligence
determination.
i
think
it
--
that
raises
a
difficult
question
and
the
way
i
would
approach
that
question
is
to
perhaps
use
some
of
what
justice
kennedy
talked
about
in
hudson
as
a
causation
approach.
that
is,
if
but
for
the
negligence
of
the
police
department
there
would
have
been--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
was
answering
justice
alito's
question
and
if
i
could
just
give
a
little
bit
of--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
it
is,
justice
scalia.
so
let
me
explain
why
it's
consistent,
which
is
our
position
is
if
police
department
error
causes
an
unconstitutional
arrest
then
you
should
suppress
evidence,
but
if
both
the
police
were
negligent
and
the
clerk
was
negligence
and
the
police
department's
negligence.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
okay,
let
me
take
the
word
"negligence"
out
then.
if
the
police
error
didn't
cause
the
discovery
of
the
evidence--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
there
would
be
no
police
error
there.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
because
in
that
case
there
would
be
no
police
error.
what
this
court
held
in
evans
is
that
police
departments
are
entitled
to
rely
on
the
representations
of
court
clerks
that
there
are
warrants.
so
if
the
court
clerk
erroneously
sends
a
warrant
over,
the
police
are
not
required
to
look
behind
that
warrant,
just
as
they're
not
required
in
evans.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
the
police
--
the
police
department
person
caused
that
by
writing
down
the
wrong
number.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
it's
the
same
question
as--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
it's
the
same
question
as
in
evans:
how
do
we
know
who
made
the
mistake?
that
question,
just
like
the
question
--
is
a
question
on
which
you're
going
to
have
to
hold
a
hearing
because
evans
says
if
it
was
court
error,
there
is
no
suppression;
and
our
position
is,
if
it
was
police
error,
there
is.
but
that's
a
very
manageable
hearing.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
as
long
as
it's
police
error,
it
counts
against
the
police.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
here's
the
problem:
there
are
two
kinds
of
negligence
you
might
have;
that
is,
you
might
have
the
negligence
of
an
individual
employee,
or
what
you
might
have
is
a
decision
to
use
a
shoddy
recordkeeping
system
that
doesn't
catch
those
errors.
so
the
question
is--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
we
have
had
some
difficulty
finding
any
reported
cases
in
which
there
is
a
police
error
of
the
kind
of
computer
glitch
that
was
just
hypothesized.
that
is
where
the
machines--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes.
what--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
part
of
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
in
my
answer
to
your
question
is
it's
unclear
in
that
situation
whether
anyone
has
done
something
wrong;
that
is,
whether
somebody
in
the
police
department
programmed
the
police
department
computer--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
you
could
have
an
act
of
god
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
if
you
wanted
to,
but
this
case
doesn't
ask
you
to
do
that.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
it's
more
powerful
sometimes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
there
is
no
question
that
as
a
matter
of
fact--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes.
this
was
a
warrantless
arrest
without
probable
cause.
and
the
question
is:
does
the
government
have
some
sort
of
affirmative
defense
as
to
why
it
should
be
allowed
to
use
this?
now,
in
evans--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
that
case
of
course
is
not
this
case,
and
you
might
want
to
leave
open
the
question
of
the--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--we
are
asking
in
this
case
for
you
to
suppress
when
someone
has
done
something
wrong.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
we
do
know
that
someone
did
something
wrong
here,
because
we
know--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
i'm
trying
to
answer--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
i'm
trying--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i
know.
i'm
trying
to
answer
that
question.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
i'm
trying
to
answer
that
question,
and
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
is:
this
case
asks
for
a
narrow
rule,
but
the
question
that
you
may
also
want
to
be
thinking
about
here
is
how
to
have
a
workable
suppression
hearing.
and
if
you
require
showings
of
different
levels
of
fault,
rather
than
asking
was
this
police-generated
error,
the
suppression
hearings
are
going
to
be
somewhat
more
cumbersome.
so
you
have
a
choice.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
we
would
be
happen
with
the
negligence
theory.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
exactly
what
i'm--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
that's
exactly
why
i
--
why
i
said
i
think
the
easier
rule
for
judges
faced
with
suppression
hearings
is
a
rule
that
says--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
that's
like--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--sure.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
there
are
two
different--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--there
are
two
different
kinds
of
cases
where
police
arrest
people:
one
set
of
cases
where
the
policeman
is
arresting
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause,
and
there,
there's
a
lot
of
room
for
error
that
is
based
on
the
facts.
the
mother
told
him
it
was
joe
when
it
was
really
john.
that's
good
enough,
good
enough,
because
that's
probable
cause.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
you
do
not--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--there
was
not
even
a
fourth--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no.
that's
correct.
if
i
can
just
say
one
thing
that
will
make
this
perhaps
a
little
clearer,
justice
breyer,
you
would
not
even
find
a
fourth
amendment
violation
in
the
first
place
in
the
hypothetical
you
gave
because
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
probable
cause
to
do
what?
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
there
is
no
such
thing
as
probable
cause
to
believe
there's
a
warrant.
you
yourself
in
hudson
said
it's
a
bright-line
rule.
either
there's
a
warrant
or
there
isn't.
here
there
was
no
warrant.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
this
court
has
never
said
that
before,
which
is
it's
not
probable
cause
to
believe
there's
a
crime
because
there's
a
warrant.
it's
--
you've
always
separated
those
two
lines
of
cases
for--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
because
here--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
for
two
reasons:
one
is,
even
in
the
probable
cause
case,
if
the
reason
he
thought
there
was
probable
cause
is
another
officer
told
him
there
was
probable
cause
and
that
officer
was
wrong,
this
court
said
in
leon
you
continue
to
suppress.
here,
this
police
officer
was
told
by
other
police
personnel
that
there
was
a
warrant,
and
there
wasn't.
so
it's
a
case
just
like
the
cases
post-leon
--
you
suppress
when
the
chain
of
information
is
fatally
flawed
by
police
error,
which
is
what
happened
here.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
i
would
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
if
you
announce
that
police
error
is
going
to
lead
to
the
suppression
of
evidence,
the
police
will
do
a
better
job
of
maintaining
their
records.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
and
then
you
won't
have
this
problem.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
but
there's
not
a
barney
fife
defense
to
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
either.
if
a
department
is
having
its
records
kept
the
way
they
are
keeping
them
here,
then
suppression
is
the
only
thing
that
tells
them:
you're
going
to
have
to--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--which
suggests
if
they
had
been
doing
a
good
job
of
maintaining
their
records
all
along,
this
violation
never
would
have
occurred.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
three
things:
one
is
the
police
themselves
are
often
unionized
and
protected
from
retaliation.
second--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
i
think
that
the
clearest
line
is
inside
the
police
and
outside,
and
let
me
give
you
a
couple
of
reasons
why.
the
first
reason--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
if
it's
the
court,
yes;
but
i
--
i
was
going
to
give
some
reasons
why
the
police
department
should
be
treated
as
an
integrated
whole.
one
reason
why
is
in
many
departments
officers,
sworn
officers,
who
are
on
desk
duty
for
physical
disabilities
and
the
like,
perform
clerical
tasks.
the
second
is
on
the
record
in
this
case.
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
a
sworn
officer
who
removed
the
warrant
from
the
file
or
it
was
a
clerk,
and
there's
no
way
of
finding
that
out
now.
a
third
reason,
if
i
could
just
point
to
this--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--this
court,
for
just
a
moment,
is
clerical
personnel,
support
personnel
--
there
is
a
reason
they
are
called
"support
personnel".
they
support
the
mission
of
the
office,
and
here
this
office
decided
to
maintain
its
records
in
a
particular
way
and
to
have
this
quick
reference
file
and
the
like,
presumably
to
support--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--they
are
support
for
the
police,
and
this
court
has--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--this
court,
at
least
since
elkins,
has
recognized
that
police
departments
often
operate
across
the
board.
if
i
could
point
to
leon
itself,
in
leon
the
search
was
conducted
by
california
municipal
police,
and
the
evidence
was
used
in
federal
court.
and
this
court
never
suggested,
not
even
for
a
minute,
that
the
fact
that
the
evidence
was
obtained
by
state-level
--
local-level
police
and
used
in
a
federal
prosecution
was
relevant
to
the
question
whether
or
not
it
should
be
suppressed.
because
what
the
court
is
trying
to
do
in
the
exclusionary
rule,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
deter
future
violations.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that
they
need
a
powerful
incentive.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
we
don't
think
this
is
a
severe
remedy,
and
we
think
that
the
professionalism
of
the
police
is
in
substantial
part
a
response
to
the
message
that
the
exclusionary
rule
sends,
which
is
either
you
professionalize
your
police
departments
or
the
evidence
they
obtain
is
going
to
be
suppressed;
either
you
maintain
good
records
or
the
reliance
on
those
records
is
going
to
lead
to
suppression.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
it
could
be,
and
if
i
can
just
point
to
--
if
you
look
at
the
government's
brief
at
page
48,
they
talk
about
how
the
fbi
maintains
its
"wanted"
lists
now.
and
they
show
that
due
to
a
list
of
reforms
they
were
able
to
cut
the
error
rate
there
from
about
6
percent
to
about
3
percent.
none
of
those
reforms,
limited
access
to
entry,
periodic
audits,
is
done
here.
and
the
last
available
published
data,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
about
--
about
alabama,
is
that
they
had
about
a
13
percent
error
rate.
that
is,
13
percent
of
the--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
in
this
case
there
was
negligence,
and
you
need
not
go
any
further
than
that.
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
absolutely.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
is
if
the
police
officer
in
your
hypothetical
was
negligent
the
evidence
would
be
suppressed.
there
are
cases
where
the
mistake
of
the
officer
was
a
reasonable
mistake,
that
is.
he
did
not--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--then
he
was
not
negligent.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
if
he
is
negligent--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i'm
absolutely
certain
that
the
answer
is
if
he
was
negligent
then
there
was
not
probable
cause;
if
there
was
not
probable
cause
and
one
of
the
other
exceptions
to
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
apply,
then
the
evidence
will
be
suppressed.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
and
the
rule
we
are
asking
for
here
--
the
narrow
rule
for
our
petitioner
is
when
you
have
negligent
error
by
police
officials,
you
suppress
but
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
in
my
colloquy
with
him
earlier,
that
rule
is
perhaps
slightly
less
workable
than
a
rule
that
says
all
error.
now
we
have
given
you
a
workable
rule
here
and
we
still
have
not
heard
i
believe
a
workable
rule
from
the
government;
because
what
mr.
dreeben
tells
you
is
that
under
some
circumstances
there
will
be
suppression.
and
i
just
want
to
make
up
with
factual
correction
here
which
is
about
the
13
percent.
it
was
a
study
by
the
fbi.
it's
a
very
dated
study
because
they
haven't
done
a
more
recent
one
and
it
was
statewide.
but
let
assume
for
purposes
of
argument
here
that
if
13
percent
of
the
errors
in
the
file
are
there
because
the
police
are
not
maintaining
their
records
properly,
there
ought
to
be
suppression
of
a
warrantless
arrest
based
on
that
because
otherwise
you're
really
telling
the
department
that
"good
enough
for
government
work"
is,
you
know,
one
out
of
six
warrants
is
invalid,
one
out
of
seven
warrants
is
invalid,
but
that's
okay.
so
then
what
you
would
have
to
have
in
each
case
is
a
hearing,
and
at
the
hearing
we
would
be
entitled
to
discovery--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--but
justice
kennedy--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--but
justice
kennedy,
if
you
believe
in
the
government's
rule
we
should
have
a
right
to
audit
that
system
to
show
that
13
percent
of
the
warrants--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes.
that's--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--but
one
of
the
things
we
know
from
the
oral
argument
and
the
transcript
in
evans
is
that
clerk
said
this
is
the
first
time
there
has
ever
been
an
error,
and
it
turned
out
there
were
four
errors
them
made
the
same
day.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
right.
but
we
would
be
entitled
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
say
to
the
clerk
on
the
stand,
have
you
ever
conducted
an
audit?
she
says,
no,
but
our
system
is
reliable.
at
that
point
i
think
we
are
entitled
to
an
audit.
that
is
we
are
entitled
to
hire
an
expert
at
government
expense
to
figure
out
how
many
times
this
department
has
gotten
it
wrong.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
the
hearing
in
this
case--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--justice
alito,
we
had
a
hearing
in
this
case
that's
adequate
to
the
rule
that
we
have
and
it
took
approximately
two
hours.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
it
will
be
the
case
more
often
then
that
you'll
have
a
two-hour
hearing
that
you
have
to
show
isolated--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--hearings
in
which
there
was
no
warrant?
i
have
examined
none,
but
i
can't
imagine
that
it
would
take
more
than
two
hours.
in
this
case
it
took
two
hours.
all
you
have
to
do
is
figure
out
who
said
there
was
a
warrant
when
there
wasn't
one.
was
it
a
court
employee
under
evans?
the
answer
is
then
clear.
you
let
the
evidence
in.
was
it
not
the
court,
that
is,
everybody
concedes
that
the
court
called,
everybody
concedes
the
warrant
was
removed,
everybody
concedes
that
the
warrant
went
back?
then
you
answer
it
that
way.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
don't
think
the
sworn
officer
distinction
makes
a
difference.
i
think
the
agency
does.
if
i
can
refer
to
the
state
cases
here,
i
think
they
can
illustrate
how
to
answer
your
question
more
precisely,
justice
kennedy.
that
is,
a
number
of
states
suppress
evidence
under
these
circumstances,
and
they
ask
what's
a
question
of
law
that
then
applies
to
all
future
cases,
which
is,
is
this
agency
an
adjunct
of
law
enforcement
or
is
it
something
else?
so,
for
example,
in
california,
the
department
of
corrections,
not.
they
are
not
an
adjunct.
so
errors
by
the
department
of
corrections,
evidence
is
admitted.
the
state
of
florida,
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
is
an
adjunct.
so
there
if
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
makes
the
mistake,
there
is
suppression.
this
rule
has
been--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i'm
not
sure.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
i
understand
rand
perfectly
well,
justice
kennedy.
but
the
question
here
is
not
a
rand
case.
it's
what
counts
as
the
police?
and
that's
the
only
question
we
are
asking
you
to
answer
here,
is
what
counts
as
the
police?
everyone
who
works
for
the
police
department.
when
they
make
an
negligent
error,
that's
enough.
now,
let
me
turn
for
just
a
moment
to
the
question
of
the
bloated
records
and
their
incentives.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
in
this
case,
yes.
yes.
i'm
perfectly
happy--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--we
are
arguing
for
negligent--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--we
are
arguing
for
that
rule
but
wanted
you
to
understand
that
there
is
a
tradeoff
as
you
identified
earlier.
our
rule
is,
i
think,
a
clean,
narrow
rule.
it
may
require,
as
justice
alito
has
pointed
out,
slightly
more
detailed
hearings.
let
me
turn
now
to
this
question
of
the
incentives,
which
is
the
incentives
of
departments,
as
illustrated
in
this
case,
are
to
leave
the
question
of
maintaining
records
to
the
end
of
the
line
in
spending
their
resources,
because
they
are
not
going
to
have
to
serve
these
warrants.
these
warrants
serve
as
an
opportunity
to
stop
and
arrest
someone
they
otherwise
wouldn't
be
able
to
stop
and
arrest
here,
because
they
like
probable
cause.
all
they
had
to
do
to
cite
--
justice
kennedy,
to
cite
rand
to
you
is
if
they
wanted
to
follow
him
for
a
while,
i'm
sure
they
could
have
found
a
motor
vehicle
violation
at
some
point.
but
they
didn't
even
want
to
do
that.
they
just
wanted
to
use
this
warrant--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
it's
good
faith.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
this
court
has
said
it's
absolutely
fine
and
it's
not
bad
faith.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
no.
that's
not
what
i
said,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
i
please--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no.
the
point
i
was
--
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
there
are
other
techniques
here
if
you
haven't
as
yet
inarticulable
suspicion
that
somebody
is
a
bad
guy
that
you
can
use
that
to
comply
with
the
constitution.
what
you
can't
do
is
rely
on
a
warrant
that
doesn't
exist,
and
then
turn
around
and
say
police
error,
but
we
are
entitled
to
rely
on
our
own
error.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
there
are
really
two
very
different
kinds
of
warrants
out
there,
justice
scalia,
as
i
understand
it.
one
is
warrants
the
police
go
and
try
and
find
themselves,
and
then
they
are
trying
to
serve
those
aggressively.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
warrants
like
this
one
that
sat
in
a
file
for
five
months,
nobody
tried
to
serve
it
during
the
vast
majority
of
that
time
because
a
lot
of
these
warrants,
as
is
true
in
this
case,
are
for
failure
to
answer
a
calendar
call
or
for
not
paying
a
parking
fine
on
time
or
for
not
sending
in
your
fine
on
a
motor
vehicle.
in
the
ott
case
that
we
cite
it
was
failure
to
pay
child
support.
so
those
are
not
the
kinds
of
things
where
the
police
are
serving
the
warrants
aggressively.
