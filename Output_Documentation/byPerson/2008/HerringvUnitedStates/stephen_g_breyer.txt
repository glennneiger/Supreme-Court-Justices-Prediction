justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
if
there
is
no
negligence?
why
do
you
need
to
argue
that
and
why
do
you
argue
that?
i
mean
doesn't
there
have
to
be
at
least
negligence
on
somebody's
part?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
either
of
those
things
are
negligence
or
worse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
i
didn't
understand
is
why
you
would
charge
the
police
with
anything
or
suppress
a
warrant
where
there
was
a
mistake
but
no
one
was
negligent
or
worse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
you
argued
for--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
said,
it
should
be
suppressed
even
if
no
one
is
negligent
or
worse.
and
i
have
trouble
seeing
why
you're
suppressing
a
warrant
where
no
one
does
anything
wrong
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
the
underlying
law
is
here.
i
mean
--
i
guess
it's
little
weird,
but
what
happens
if
the
policeman
arrests
the
wrong
person,
but
it's
nobody's
fault?
you
know,
the
person
was
pretending
to
be
his
brother.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
the
mother
said
it's
john
and
it's
really
joe.
and
so,
the
policeman
wasn't
at
fault.
they
arrest
the
wrong
person.
i
guess
that's
happened
in
history--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
do
they
suppress
things
then?
i
wouldn't
think
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
maybe
they
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
do
we
suppress?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
do
not?
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there's
no
reason
then,
if
we
don't
suppress
when
there's
no
error
in
the
part
of
the
policeman,
none,
it
was
just
a
weird
circumstance,
then
i
don't
understand
why
we
would
suppress
here.
and
nor
do
i
understand
why
you
have
to
argue
this
because
i
thought
it's
clear
here
that
there
is
error,
and
it
was
negligently
caused.
there
were
four
months
that
went
by
without
anybody
doing
anything
about
this
mistake.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
one
question
i
have
in
my
mind,
and
it's
the
only
factor
i
thought
of
hypothetically
that
cuts
against
you.
this
is
the
argument
and
i'd
like
you
to
respond
to
it.
i
take
everything
you
said
as
so.
i'll
assume
all
that.
and
so
i'd
still
say
the
rule,
the
basic
rule
of
suppression,
putting
leon
to
the
side,
basic
rule
is
--
the
opposite
of
holmes:
if
the
constable
blunders,
you
suppress
the
evidence.
okay.
now,
our
prior
case
--
here
we
have
a
case
where
the
constable
blundered.
i
grant
you,
not
the
arresting
officers.
it
was
a
different
policeman,
and
it
was
a
different
form
of
error.
but
five
months
this
thing
--
this
warrant
had
been
recalled
five
months
earlier
and
you
agree
that
it
was
negligent.
therefore,
the
constable
blundered.
and
the
virtue
of
our
earlier
case
where
we
said
don't
suppress,
it
wasn't
the
constable
who
blundered.
so
i
see
an
absolutely
clear
line:
if
the
constable
blunders
you
suppress;
if
it's
somebody
else
who
blundered,
you
don't.
now,
every
time
i've
tried
to
think
of
a
substitute
for
that
clear
line,
i've
run
into
trouble.
i've
been
sitting
in
my
chambers
with
my
law
clerks
and
we've
tried
out
five
substitutes,
and
i
can't
find
one
decent
substitute
that
isn't
filled
with
problems.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
substitute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
well,
i'm
overstating
my
point.
what
i'm
really
driving
at
and
trying
to
show
you
is
you,
if
you
want
to
have
a
different
rule
than
within
the
prior
case,
remember
the
one
where
it
wasn't
the
police
that
blundered,
you
have
to
come
up
with
some
rule.
and
i
want
to
know
what
your
rule
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
now
we
have
--
let's
think
about
that.
the
special
rule
is
now
we
have
the
leon
exception
and
now
we
have
a
new
exception,
and
the
new
exception
is
called
for
isolated
police
clerical
errors.
well,
that's
going
to
be
interesting,
i
suspect.
the
first
thing
you'll
have
when
you
try
to
impose
your
rule
is
you
will
have
the
defense
attorneys
throughout
the
city
going
in
to
see
if
it's
an
isolated
error.
and
they
will,
of
course,
have
a
right
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
is
the
only
such
error,
whether
there
are
other
clerical
errors,
how
often
they
occur,
what
the
--
is
that
an
administrable
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
other
question.
suppose
that
the
error
here
consisted
not
of
a
computer,
but
rather
joe,
who
is
the
policeman,
has
a
partner
called
sam,
and
sam
told
joe
that
this
is
harry
smith,
when
negligently
it
wasn't
harry
smith?
it
was
joe
smith.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean
does
that
count
as
a
clerical
error
if,
in
fact,
it's
the
man's
partner
who
tells
him
this
negligently?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
negligent.
it's
negligent
police
work.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
negligent
error.
you
mean
we
don't
suppress
the
negligent
errors
of
the
partners
who,
after
all,
say,
let's
arrest
this
man
over
here,
and
through
negligence
they
have
got
the
wrong
man?
we
don't
suppress?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
must
be
millions
--
not
millions,
but
there
must
have
been
cases
where
two
policemen
or
one
policeman
goes
off
to
arrest
someone
and
negligently
arrests
the
wrong
man.
and
when
he
does
that
and
does
a
search,
we
don't
suppress.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
leon.
i'm
not
thinking
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
thinking
of
a
warrant.
i'm
thinking
of
a
policeman
who
has
a
warrant
for
jack
smith
and
he
goes
to
arrest
jack
brown
because
through
negligence
he
went
to
the
wrong
house.
now,
under
those
circumstances
would
we
suppress
the
drugs
that
happen
to
be
found
in
jack's
house.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
must
have
been
a
lot
of
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
about
the
lower
courts?
what
have
they
done?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
use
30
seconds
of
your
eight
minutes
because
i
want
some
clarity
on
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
divide
in
your
mind
two
separate
things:
the
nature
of
the
bad
conduct:
is
it
negligent,
reckless,
deliberate;
and
the
other
question
is
who
engaged
in
it
--
a
police
department
official
or
some
other
official?
i
thought
this
case
was
about
the
second
question,
but
now
i'm
confused
about
the
first
question
because
i
suppose
a
policeman,
an
arresting
officer
makes
a
negligent
error.
he
goes
to
the
wrong
house.
and
he
never
looks
at
the
number;
and
he
arrests,
starts
to
arrest
the
wrong
person:
is
the
evidence
suppressed?
if
the
evidence
isn't
suppressed,
frankly,
i
don't
see
why
a
clerical
official
should
be
held
to
a
higher
standard;
but
if
the
evidence
is
suppressed
then
quite
possibly
the
clerical
official
should
be
held
to
the
same
standard.
so
you've
heard
the
government
say
well,
the
answer
isn't
clear;
very
often
a
negligent
official
--
a
negligent
officer
would
not
have
that
evidence
suppressed.
well,
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
was
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
if
he
is
negligent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
excuse
me,
because
i
think
i'm
getting
a
different
view
from
the
government.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
we've
got
this--
