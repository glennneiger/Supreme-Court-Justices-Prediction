could
i
ask
this
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--could
i
ask
this
question?
you're
saying
that
the
question
is
whether
anybody
did
anything
wrong
at
all.
this
is
not
undisputed,
that
this
person
was
illegally
arrested?
the
arrest
itself
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
whether
it
can
be
justified.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben,
can
i
go
back
to
your
point
you
were
just
making.
what
incentive
does
the
police
department
have
to
withdraw
warrants
that
have
been
cancelled?
why
not
just
leave
them
there?
as
long
as
they
are
there,
it
would
justify
an
arrest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
put
aside
good
faith
for
the
moment.
if
you
just
think
in
terms
of
incentives
of
officers,
would
they
not
have
an
incentive
just
to
leave
everything
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
the
warrant
doesn't
affect
the
danger.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
incentive
exists
whether
there
is
a
warrant
in
his
pocket
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben,
can
i
ask
a
background
question?
how
frequent
does
the
issue
in
this
case
arise?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
my
understanding,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
the
case
may
have
more
symbolic
importance
than
practical
importance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
cases
where
--
this
is
a
drug
peddler
here
that
was
caught.
are
there
any
cases
involving
violent
criminals
that
have
been
affected
by
the
outcome
of
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
if
you
did
the
cost-benefit
analysis
the
way
justice
stewart
would,
the
cost
is
always
zero
to
the
state
because
they
would
not
have
had
the
evidence
if
they
had
obeyed
the
law.
