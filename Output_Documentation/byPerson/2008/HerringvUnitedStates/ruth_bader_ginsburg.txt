but
how
do
you
know?
how
do
you
know?
that's
the
problem.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
one
is
that
you
--
you
are
stuck
with
the
arizona
v.
evans,
which
says
if
it's
the
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
don't
know
if
these
records
are
good,
bad,
or
indifferent.
as
far
as
this
record
shows,
this
could
be
an
isolated
incident,
or
it
could
be
typical
of
what
goes
on.
we
just
don't
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
what
you've
said
about
the
danger
to
the
arresting
office
--
officer
and
so
they
don't
undertake
an
arrest
lightly,
doesn't
fit
with
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
was
a
police
officer
who
really
wanted
to
go
after
the
defendant.
he
expected
--
he
suspected
defendant
was
a
bad
guy.
so
that's
how
this
all
started.
so
he
called
his
own
department,
do
we
have
any
warrant,
and
then
the
next
county's
department.
but
this
was
an
officer
who
wanted
to
go
after
the
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here,
and
we
have
a
13
percent
error
rate.
if
this
case
goes
your
way,
the
police
have
limited
resources;
why
should
they
spend
them
on
upgrading
their
computer
system
when
if
there
is
an
error
it
won't
matter?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
1983
recoveries
have
there
been
when
someone
says
the
police,
they
convicted
me
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence
that
wasn't
suppressed,
but
they
committed
a
fourth
amendment
violation
so
i
should
prevail
in
the
1983
action?
how
many
defendants
in
that
situation
have
ever
won
a
1983
action?
