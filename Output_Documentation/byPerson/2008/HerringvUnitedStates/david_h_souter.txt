justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
i
mean,
why
do
you
say
that?
i
mean,
we
--
we
have
--
just
getting
outside
the
criminal
law
for
a
minute,
we
--
we've
got
a
whole
system
of
personal
liability
law
in
which
the
theory
is
that,
in
effect,
requiring
compensation
for
negligence,
even
though
it
is
not
an
act
of
bad
faith
or
malice,
is
--
is
going
to
affect
conduct.
why
do
you
assume
it
will
not
affect
conduct
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
you
think
it's
probable
that
it
will
affect
conduct?
i
mean,
if
the
police
know
that
they
are
going
to
lose
the
case
because
they
are
engaging
in
a
negligent
or
objectively
unreasonable
way
in
--
in
relation
to
their
warrant-keeping,
they
are
going
to
be
more
careful.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
--
but
they
also--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
they
also,
as
in
this
case,
in
the
course
of
--
of
committing
their
--
their
negligent
arrest
find
evidence
of
a
crime.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
can't
know
that,
but
we
all
know,
as
a
practical
matter,
that
that's
why
police
want
the
--
the
greatest
scope
to
the
arrest
power.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
in
the
course
of
doing
incidental
searches,
they
find
things.
they
know
that,
and
we
know
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
reaching
--
what
about
reaching
your
standard
in
cases
in
which
the
arrest
is
wrong,
not
because
there's
no
warrant,
but
because
there's
just
slightly
less
than
probable
cause?
if
there
are
isolated
incidents
of
that
are
we
going
to
--
are
we
going
to
say
that
in
fact
that
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
we're
starting
with
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
--
i
think
we're
starting
with
background
law
at
this
point
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
if
there
is
an
arrest
without
probable
cause
or
without
a
valid
warrant.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
warrant
itself
may
be
subject
to
attack,
but
at
least
that's
sort
of
the
front
line
of
our
objective
reasonableness
inquiry.
and
you're
making
a
dent
in
the
warrant
requirement
for
isolated
incidents,
and
i
don't
see
why
we
can't
or
why
coherence
would
not
require
us
to
make
the
same
dent
in
the
probable
cause
requirement
for
equally
isolated
mistakes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
miss
karlan's
figures
are
correct
in
alabama
there
would
be
suppression.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i
said
if
her
figures
are
correct
and
there's
a
13
percent
error
rate
either
in
the
state
of
alabama
or
at
least
in
the
department
involved
that
we'd
have
suppression
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
going
to
function
--
even
on
your
theory,
it's
going
to
function
differently
on
a
department
to
department
basis
depending
on
the
error
rate.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you've
got
a
13
percent
error
rate
i
think
you've
got
a
pretty
good
prima
facie
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
fact
is
unless
the
13
percent
error
rate
in
a
negligence-free
system,
you
would
have
suppression
there
and
you
would
not
have
suppression
there
in
the
town
next
door
or
the
county
next
door
or
the
state
next
door.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
that
basically
was
the
distinction
that
you
were
arguing
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
take
it
if
you're
not
accepting
--
if
you're
not
accepting
--
i
mean,
you're
not
accepting
the
proposition
that
the
13
percent
error
rate
which
is
not
somehow
shown
to
be
non-negligent
should
have
a
different
result,
you
are
saying
in
the
13
percent
case
we're
still
not
going
to
suppress.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you
--
if
you
were
to
make
that
argument
and
it
came
down
to
that
bald
a
proposition,
i
assume
you
would
come
in
with
some
kind
of
evidentiary
basis
to
tell
us
exactly
what
the
cost
is.
and
you
have
spoken
of
the
cost
today.
you
have
not
spoken
of
the
benefit
and
the
value
of
having
relatively
error-free
arrest
recordkeeping.
but
i
haven't
heard
anything
about
the
unreasonable
cost
of
the
exclusionary
rule--
justice
david
h.
souter
--beyond
the
record.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
sure
it
is.
but
that
does
not
even
get
us
to,
as
it
were,
to
half
the
equation.
we
want
to
be
know
how
much
of
that
there
is
and
we
want
to
be
able
to
measure
against
that
the
value
that
society
is
getting
by
requiring
valid
arrest
warrants
and
in
a
probable
cause
case
by
requiring
probable
cause.
and
you
can't
just
walk
in
and
say,
well,
there's
a
cost.
we
know
there's
a
cost.
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
you
think
we
should
if
we
are
in
effect
--
if
you
are
making
what
sounds
to
me
like
an
empirical
argument
--
there
is
a
cost
to
society,
cases
are
being
lost,
criminals
are
going
free
--
don't
you
think
that
we
ought
to
have
a
factual
basis
to
know
what
that
cost
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
we've
done
an
exclusionary
rule
now
and
in
effect
you
are
arguing
for
an
exception
to
it
because
the
cost
is
too
great,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
burden
is
on
you
to
tell
us
what
the
cost
figure
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you
take
that
argument
to
the
extreme,
we
won't
have
an
exclusionary
rule
at
all,
i
suppose.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
don't
you
take
--
i
understood
you
to
take
the
position
and
i
thought
the
court
had
previously
taken
the
position
that
the
cost
benefit
analysis
had
to
be
a
systemic
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
true.
i
mean,
we
operate
--
quite
think
frankly
we
operate
on
the
basis
of
a
--
of
a
good
guess
and
i
think
your
argument
is
saying
let's
have
--
let's
have
an
exception
to
the
good
guess.
and
if
--
if
you
start
with
a
good
guess
as
the
baseline
it
seems
to
me
you
--
you
ought
to
have
something
more
than
another
guess
to
justify
the
exception.
