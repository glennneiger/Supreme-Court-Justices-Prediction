justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
is
it
possible
to
tell
from
that
letter
whether
or
not
he
took
his
action
on
the
basis
of
no
evidence,
or
that
it
was
the
type
of
thing
that
the
board
didn't
go
into?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
as
between
you
and
ms.
stillman,
have
you
divided
up
the
responsibility
for
talking
about
the
particular
sections
of
the
act
and
whether
conduct
was
pre-empted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
know
when
you
are
ready
for
questions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
will
ask
you,
and
you
tell
me
if
i
should
ask
mrs.
stillman
rather
than
you.
why
does
this
conduct
violate
the
8(b)(1)(a),
making
it
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
the
rights
guaranteed
in
section
7,
when
the
individual
was
a
supervisor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
two
different
lines
for
that
board
rule,
one
being
if
it
can
happen
to
him,
it
can
happen
to
me,
that
type
of
thing?
hasn't
the
board
just
retreated
from
that
aspect
in
the
parker
robb
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
reason
they
withdrew
at
least
a
little
in
parker
robb,
isn't
it
the
feeling
that
they
were
really
putting
an
end
run
around
the
exemption
of
supervisors
in
the
act
if
they
went
further?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
certainly
arguably,
but
do
you
think
that
your
best
case
is
on
arguably,
that
if
we
were
to
take
it
on
ourselves
to
decide,
is
this
in
fact
prohibited,
and
we
came
to
the
conclusion,
no,
it
is
not
in
fact
prohibited,
that
you
would
then
have
to
rely
on
the
arguably
prohibited
aspect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
as
you
see
it,
then,
there
are
three
bright
squares
in
this
area.
one
is
the
actually
prohibited.
the
other
is
the
arguably
prohibited,
and
the
other
is
the
designedly
left
free.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
does
that
fully
explain
our
sears
decision?
there
the
board
would
have
taken
into
consideration
the
same
facts
had
they
been
brought
to
its
attention
by
another
party.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
superior
court
dismissed
the
employer,
didn't
they--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--saying
that
under
any
theory,
you
couldn't
hold
the
employer
liable.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
other
than
whatever
prohibitions
may
be
placed
on
it
by
conflicting
federal
law,
georgia
is
free
to
fashion
its
tort
law--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
malicious
interference--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
you
saying
that...
so
supposing
that
the
regional
director
were
to
make
a
finding,
a
mistaken
finding
as
it
turned
out,
in
an
area
which
wasn't
even...
which
wasn't
designedly
left
free,
wasn't
in
fact
prohibited,
and
wasn't
arguably
prohibited,
but
he
was
just
sticking
his
nose
into
things
that
the
board
really
wouldn't
have
authorized
him
to
go
ahead
with,
and
he
made
a
finding
on
some
facts
that
were
never
appealed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
isn't
a
type
of
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
charge,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wouldn't
be
true
as
to
mr.
jones,
at
least
in
the
facts
here.
he
was
moving
from
a
supervisory
position
to
another
supervisory
position.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
sort
of
a
strange
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
remedies,
that
you
have
to
exhaust
your
federal
remedies
before
you
can
go
to
the
state
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
say
that
the
federal
agency
dropped
out
and
the
federal
interests
dropped
out
are
really
two
different
things.
i
mean,
i
would
think
if
you
were
obligated
to
go
to
the
board
in
the
first
place,
that
the
board
and
the
national
labor
policy
have
some
interest,
if
the
board
decides
that
the
evidence
doesn't
support
the
making
of
a
charge,
but
if
the
evidence
had
supported
the
making
of
a
charge,
we
would
bring
one,
that
they
have
some
interest
in
having
the
matter
left
alone
by
other
entities.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
unions
are
protected
by
the
act,
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
i
see.
this
context.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
had
the
regional
director
investigated
further,
he
would
have
uncovered
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
what
did
you
do,
just
file
a
complaint
and
figure
that
you
might
come
up
with
some
evidence
later,
and
you
haven't
come
up
with
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
georgia
malicious
interference
doesn't
require
coercion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
an
employee...
what
if
a
supervisor
has
an
agreement
like
the
respondent
here
apparently
was
contemplating
with
the
employer
for
a
term
of
years'
employment
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
the
employer
breaches
it.
can
the
supervisor
go
into
the
state
court
and
sue
the
employer
without
being
defended
against
on
the
ground
that
congress
intended
to
have
employers...
give
freedom
of
action
to
employers
against
supervisors?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
preposterous.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
it's
preposterous,
putting
beasley
to
one
side?
