mr.
laurence
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
procedural
history
of
this
case
is
set
out
at
pages
2
through
6
of
our
brief,
the
blue
brief,
and
i
will
very
briefly
summarize
that
history.
this
matter
began
when
mr.
jones
filed
a
charge
with
the
atlanta
regional
office
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
against
local
926
of
the
operating
engineers.
the
language
of
the
charge
is
set
out
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
the
allegation
is
that
the
union
violated
sections
8(b)(1)(a)
and
8(b)(1)(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended,
the
sections
prohibiting
certain
forms
of
restraint
and
coercion.
the
regional
director
investigated
that
charge
and
issued
a
letter
opinion
stating
that
he
would
not
file
a
complaint--
mr.
laurence
gold
--it
appears
to
us
from
the
language
he
used
that
he
found
the
evidence
insufficient
to
find
that
the
union
had
caused
the
discharge,
that
he
found
the
evidence
insufficient
to
find
that
the
union
had
restrained
or
coerced
the
employer,
that
he
found
that
the
union
had
participated
in
discussions
with
the
employer
concerning
who
should
be
a
supervisor
on
this
job,
and
all
of
these
questions
are
of
the
very
essence
of
section
8(b)(1),
and
what
is
designedly
left
unregulated
and
is
permitted
by
section
8(b)(1)
so
that
it
would
be
our
view
that
he
was
not
taking
the
position,
this
is
none
of
our
business,
but
rather,
was
taking
the
position
that
this
was
not
the
type
of
activity
which
warranted
the
issuance
of
a
complaint.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor.
the
next
point
i
was
going
to
make
is
that
the
board,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
has
adopted
a
very
rigorous
internal
system
of
determining
when
to
exercise
prosecutorial
discretion
on
behalf
of
charging
parties,
and
that
includes
not
only
an
investigation
and
determination
at
the
regional
level,
but
a
review
at
the
national
level.
the
last
line
of
the
regional
director's
decision
here
is
that
form
nlrb
4938,
procedure
for
filing
an
appeal,
is
attached.
the
appeal
period
expires
at
the
close
of
business
on
august
1,
1978,
and
no
appeal
was
taken.
mr.
laurence
gold
the...
i
think
the
short
answer
under
the
decisions
is
no.
the
courts
of
appeals
are
uniform
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
courts
to
review
the
general
counsel's
exercise
of
his
authority
to
institute
complaints
any
more
than
there
is
to
review
a
united
states
attorney's
determination
not
to
prosecute
an
alleged
crime.
rather
than
going
to
the
nlrb
general
counsel,
the...
mr.
jones
went
to
the
state
courts
of
georgia.
he
filed
a
lawsuit
alleging
that
the
union
had
violated
the
georgia
law
prohibiting
tortious
interference
with
employment
relations.
the
complaint
which
begins
by
alleging
that
he
had
been
a
union
member
and
had
dropped
his
union
membership,
and
goes
on
to
allege
this
interference
with
employment
relationships,
is
set
out
at
pages
4
and
5
of
our
brief.
he
also
sued
the
employer,
and
in
addition
he
alleged
a
violation
of
the
georgia
right
to
work
law.
all
parties
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
this
is
the
type
of
matter
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
under
the
garmon
rule
articulated
by
this
court.
the
trial
court
agreed.
the
georgia
appellate
court
took
the
view,
as
those
courts
have
taken
in
the
past,
that
the
tort
of
interference
with
employment
relations
is
not
pre-empted
either
for
supervisors
or
for
employees
in
that
state.
the
union
invoked
both
this
court's
appellate
jurisdiction
and
the
certiorari
jurisdiction,
and
the
court
in
setting
the
case
for
plenary
consideration
reserved
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
i
unfortunately
from
my
own
standpoint
have
to
be
very
brief
indeed
on
the
question
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
we
have
confessed
in
our
papers
that
there
is
no
appellate
jurisdiction.
we
reviewed
this
matter
after
the
court's
order,
and
that
is
our
view,
and
we
felt
it
our
obligation
to
state
it
straightforwardly.
we
do
believe
that
this
case
is
properly
here
on
certiorari.
it
is
our
substantive
position
that
the
georgia
court's
rule
is
squarely
contrary
to
the
rule
stated
by
this
court
in
the
borden
and
perko
cases
in
373
u.s.
the
argument
made
by
respondents
is
that
we
haven't
shown
a
sufficient
conflict
between
georgia
law
and
this
court's
law
to
warrant
certiorari.
we
do
not
understand
how
we
could
show
a
clearer
conflict.
perko,
like
this
case,
is
a
case
in
which
a
supervisor
alleged
that
a
union
interfered
with
his
employee...
employment
relationship.
the
only
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case
is
that
mr.
perko
didn't
even
start
down
the
road
of
exhausting
labor
board
procedures,
but
rather
went
directly
to
court.
tort
claimed
in
that
case
and
the
tort
claimed
in
this
case
are
the
same.
the
union's
conduct
in
both
cases
is
the
same,
and
this
court,
as
we
fully
developed
in
our
brief
in
perko,
held
that
the
tort
of
interference
with
employment
relations
in
situations
of
this
kind
is
pre-emptive.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
i
have
four
or
five
more
minutes.
i
was
going
to
develop
why
under
the
scheme
of
the
act
as
a
whole
this
tort
is
pre-empted.
ms.
stillman
was
going
to
develop
what
the
labor
board's--
mr.
laurence
gold
--any
time,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
gold
ms.
stillman
was
going
to
develop
what
the
exact
nature
of
the
labor
board's
regulation,
scheme
of
regulation
is
in
this
area,
because
one
prong
of
our
argument
is
that
this
is
an
area
where
there
is
a
substantial
body
of
labor
board
regulation,
and
therefore
even
if
one
assumes
that
we
look
only
at
the
arguably
prohibited
aspect
of
garman,
this
is,
as
perko
holds,
an
area
where
the
particular
system
of
procedures,
rules,
and
remedies
stated
in
the
labor
act
pre-empts
state
law.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
the
8(b)(1)
has
two
parts.
the
labor
board
takes
the
view
that
where,
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
the
construction
industry,
you
have
people
who
move
back
and
forth
between
supervisory
and
employee
status,
union
restraint
or
coercion
of
an
employer
based
on
the
union
or
non-union
status
of
a
supervisor
violates
the
employee's
rights,
because
for
the
same
kind
of
demonstration
effect
this
court
relied
on
in
cases
like
american
broadcasting
company
versus
writers'
guild.
mr.
laurence
gold
not
from
that
aspect
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
because
they
cited
and
reaffirmed
taladiga
cotton,
which
this
court
relied
on
in
perko,
and
which
is
part
and
parcel--
mr.
laurence
gold
--we
can
hardly
say
that
we
want
the
board
to
push
further
and
further
into
this
area,
but
the
discussion
we
are
having
certainly
demonstrates
that
this
is
arguably
prohibited.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
our
view
is,
and
this
is
the
one
point
i
do
want
to
stress
before
i
allow
ms.
stillman
her
time,
that
in
the
area
of
the
extent
to
which
unions
can
have
an
impact
on
supervisors'
employment
rights,
the
logic
of
the
entire
act
is,
as
shown
by
the
use
of
the
words
1947
debates
on
the
status
of
supervisors,
is
that
employers
should
have
very
substantial
protections
in
being
able
to
make
whatever
judgments
they
want
on
how
they
treat
supervisors.
as
i
am
sure
you
are
well
aware,
under
the
beasley
case,
the
employer
cannot
be
held
under
a
state
right
to
work
law
for
firing
somebody
for
joining
a
union
or
refusing
to
join
a
union
if
that
person
is
a
supervisor,
as
just
one
example
of
the
great
freedom
that
employers
have.
given
the
logic
of
that
situation,
we
believe
that
a
union
certainly
can
in
the
interests
of
its
own
members
ask
an
employer
not
to
have
a
certain
person
as
a
supervisor
and
not
to
have
him
do
certain
supervisory
tasks,
and
if
that
is
true,
certainly
to
the
extent
a
union
is
not
engaging
in
restraint
and
coercion
and
is
limiting
itself
to
such
activity,
the
area
is
either
arguably
protected
or
designedly
left
unregulated.
and
thus,
even
if
it
were
to
be
plainly
and
unequivocally
established
and
taken
as
established
that
the
union
did
not
violate
8(b)(1),
it
would
not
preclude
the
conclusion
that
a
georgia
determination
that
the
union
committed
this
tort
works
the
greatest
possible
interference
with
the
federal
scheme,
namely,
a
state
interdiction
of
that
which
congress
allowed
to
happen,
and
which
in
its
very
extensive...
which
in
congress's
very
extensive
consideration
of
how
to
regulate
union-management
relations
with
regard
to
supervisors,
it
did
not
make
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
and
whenever
a
state
tort
action
focuses
on
precisely
the
same
facts
and
circumstances
that
the
board
would
consider
in
determining
which
of
those
boxes
to
put
alleged
conduct,
then
the
state
action
is
pre-empted.
mr.
laurence
gold
in
sears,
there
was
an
added
factor
which
is
not
here,
namely,
the
consideration
that
there
was
no
way
to
secure
the...
a
board
determination
or
a
general
counsel's
determination.
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
which
the
individual
could
invoke.
here,
the
critical
inquiry,
has
the
union
restrained,
restrained
or
coerced,
or
has
it
not,
is
as
open
to
this
supervisor
as
it
is
to
any
employee
and
any
8(a)(1)
or
8(a)(3)
or
8(b)(1)
or
8(b)(2).
the
door
is
open.
there
has
never
been
a
case
that
i
know
of,
and
there
would
be
nothing
left
of
the
doctrine,
i
would
suggest,
if
in
that
situation
where
the
door
to
the
general
counsel
is
open,
it
was
nonetheless
held
that
the
state
courts
were
also
an
alternative
forum.
mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
our
view
that
the
respondent's
argument
simply
ignores
the
fact
that
congress
in
1947
did
not
only
give
employers
wide
areas
of
freedom
with
regard
to
the
hire
and
fire
of
supervisors,
but
that
congress
also
in
section
8(b)(1)
regulated
union
conduct
to
a
substantial
extent
with
regard
to
what
unions
can
and
cannot
do
in
interfering
with
such
employment
relations.
mr.
laurence
gold
my
understanding
from
this
court's
decision
in
beasley
is
that
the
answer
is
that
he
cannot
go
into
state
court
against--
mr.
laurence
gold
--the
employer.
mr.
laurence
gold
we
certainly
didn't
lobby
to
take
supervisors
out
from
under
the
act.
congress's
view
was
that
employers
should
have
faithful
agents
and
shouldn't
be
bound
by
any
restrictions.
that
is
why
the
state
right
to
work
laws,
even
though
14(b)
normally
gives
them
precedence,
don't
take
precedent.
obviously,
that
was
the
view
of
the
georgia
courts
here,
because
the
empty
seat
is
the
seat
of
the
employer,
and
our
basic
view
is
that
when
congress
came
to
regulating
unions,
it
said,
unions
may
not
restrain
and
coerce
employers
in
that
freedom,
but
it
used
those
limited
words,
and
it
did
it
against
the
background
of
an
overall
system
of
labor
relations
where
unions
can
discuss
employee
concerns
with
employers,
and
that
it
cannot
be.
it
would
be
in
terms
of
absurdities
or
paradoxes
far
greater
if
the
union
by
exercising
that
which
congress
designedly
left
unregulated,
namely,
its
right
to
go
in
and
say
to
the
employer,
it
is
not
good
labor
relations
to
have
this
man
supervising
these
employees,
opens
itself
to
a
state
tort
action
with
damages
and
punitive
damages,
whereas
if
it
restrains
and
coerces
the
employer,
you
go
through
the
labor
board
proceeding.
as
the
court
said
in
garmon,
congress
regulated
areas
of
activity
or
conduct.
one
of
the
areas
of
activity
or
conduct
was
this
interplay
concerning...
between
employers
and
unions
that
represent
those
employers,
employees,
the
job
tenure
of
supervisors.
perko
was
right
when
it
was
decided.
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
perko.
and
neither
congress
nor
this
court
has
changed
the
rules.
mr.
laurence
gold
only
in
one
narrow
sense.
it
was
probably
necessary
to
make
that
finding
in
order
not
to
issue
an
8(b)(1)(a)--
mr.
laurence
gold
--complaint,
but
it
is
irrelevant
in
our
view
on
the
pre-emption
question.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
on
the
pre-emption
question
as
well,
because
it
is
our
view
that
whether,
as
in
perko,
the
individual
never
goes
to
the
labor
board
or
as
in
this
case,
he
does
go
to
the
labor
board,
the
fact
that
the
labor
board
determines
not
to
go
forward
doesn't
open
the
union
to
a
state
court
proceeding
which
in
all--
mr.
laurence
gold
--an
employee?
the
board
law
is
that
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
the
union
is
acting
for
irrational
reasons.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
and
the
board
carries
that
same
irrational
reason
line
over
into
supervisors
under
8(b)(1)(a).
