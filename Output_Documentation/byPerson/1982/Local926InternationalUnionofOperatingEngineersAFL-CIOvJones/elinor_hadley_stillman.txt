ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
the
board's
position
that
the
trial
court
judge
in
this
case
did
exactly
the
right
thing
in
finding
that
the
complaint,
the
state
action
was
pre-empted
in
dismissing
the
complaint,
because,
as
he
said,
i
am
being
asked
to
take
a
second
look
at
the
same
matter
that
the
board
has
looked
at
here,
and
in
fact
has
resolved
in
manners
displeasing
to
the
plaintiff.
we
have
explained
in
our
brief...
we
addressed
our
brief
mainly
to
the
complaint
allegation,
which
was,
there
is
malicious
interference
with
contract
here
because
the
union
coerced
and
intimidated
the
company
into
firing
him.
that
is
what
the
complaint
said,
and
that
seemed
to
be
the
theory
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm.
they
are
now
saying,
well,
we
don't
have
to
show
coercion
and
intimidation
of
the
employer.
we
can
win
in
the
georgia
court
if
we
just
show
simple
interference,
just
knowingly
procured
breach
of
contract,
and
that
they
say
is
not
a
matter
for
the
board
or
not
a
matter
with
which
the
board
is
concerned.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
he
is
totally
free
to
do
what...
and
that
raises
the
interesting
question,
justice
rehnquist,
of
what
happens
if
an
employer
wanting
to
make
a
decision
about
a
supervisor
calls
in
the
union
and
asks
for
the
union's
advice.
is
the
employer
inducing
the
union
to
induce
a
breach
of
contract
then
if
he
decides
to
follow
the
suggestions
of
the
union
agent?
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
yes,
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
but
it
does
seem
to
us
that
elements
critical
to
the
georgia
tort
are
also
resolved
by
the
board
in
considering
8(b)(1)(a)
and
8(b)(1)(b)
and
in
fact
were
resolved
by
the
regional
director
in
this
case,
and
i
would
like
here...
first
let
me
say
our
brief
addresses
mainly
8(b)(1)(b),
because
it
is
quite
clear
that
when
the
regional
director
said,
this
union
did
not
coerce
the
company,
that
they
should
not
be
able
to
go
over
to
the
state
court
then
and
say
that
they
coerced
the
company.
but
the
regional
director
also
said,
as
mr.
gold
pointed
out,
the
union
did
not
cause
the
discharge.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
that
is
not
present
here,
because
the
finding
that
he
did
make
is
relevant
to
this
case.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
suppose
if
he
was
on
a
complete
frolic
and
detour--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--well,
that's...
but
that's
embodied
to
some
extent
in,
i
think,
the
policy
reasons
here.
i
would
like,
justice
rehnqist,
to
touch
a
little
more
on
what
you
were
exploring
with
mr.
gold
concerning
the
board's
theory
of
violations
of
8(b)(1)(a)
in
the
construction
of
this...
because
that
is
very
relevant
to
this
case,
and
we
didn't
emphasize
this
much
in
our
brief
because
we
thought
their
theory
was
intimidation
and
coercion
of
the
employer.
the
board
has
held...
now,
i
am
not
talking
at
first
with
respect
to
a
supervisory
position.
i
am
talking
now
with
respect
to,
let's
say,
an
employee
job.
the
board
has
held
that
when
a
union
has
a
hiring
hall,
when
the
union
has
control
over
jobs
out
there,
and
employees
have
to
come
through
the
hiring
hall
to
get
jobs,
it
is,
of
course,
perfectly
proper
for
the
union,
if
it
is
running
its
hiring
hall
properly,
non-arbitrarily,
to
have
that
kind
of
control,
but
if
a
business
agent
takes
action
with
respect
to
somebody's
job
opportunity
on
some
arbitrary
basis...
let's
say
he's
very
hostile
to
the
man,
he
says,
you
have
been
speaking
out
in
union
meetings
in
a
way
that
i
don't
like,
and
you're
not
going
to...
i'm
going
to
put
you
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
list,
and
you're
not
going
to
be
treated
as
fairly
as
other
people...
well,
the
board
says
this
is
an
8(b)(1)(a),
because
this
is
intimidating
that
man
in
his
right
to
be
not
a
docile
union
member
if
he
doesn't
want
to.
he
has
a
section
7
right
not
to
have
to
toe
the
line,
not
to
have
to
curry
the
favor
of
the
business
agent.
and
so
that
is
an
8(b)(1)(a).
now,
what
happens...
now,
of
course,
supervisors
ordinarily
wouldn't
have
that
right,
because
they
don't
enjoy
rights
under
section
7.
they
are
excluded
from
the
definition
of
employee.
but
what
happens
in
the
construction
industry
is,
you
have
workers
coming
through
these
hiring
halls,
and
they
may
on
one
job
get
a
referral
out
to
a
foreman's
job,
on
the
next...
that
job
finishes.
typically
these
jobs
don't
last
forever.
they
may
be
short-term.
he
comes
back
to
the
hall
for
another
referral.
the
next
time
there
may
be
no
foreman's
job.
he
may
take
a
job
as
an
employee,
as
a
worker.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
your
honor,
we
are
going
on
the
complaint
here,
and
i
don't
know
what
those
facts
might
be.
in
fact,
the
deposition,
if
you
want
to
get
into
that,
although
i
don't
think
that
is
a
reviewable
record
here,
said
that
in
the
past
he
had
taken
employee
jobs,
and
there
is
no...
certainly
no...
it
can't
be
argued
that
he
wouldn't
be
dependent
on
the
union
in
the
future
for
employee
jobs.
what
the
board
says
about
people
in
the
construction
industry
is,
these
men
are
dependent
on
the
union
hiring
hall
to
get
jobs,
and
when
the
union
agent
interferes...
interferes
even
by
just
asking
the
employer,
not
necessarily
coercing
the
employer,
demonstrates
to
the
workman,
i
can
interfere
with
your
job,
he
intimidates
that
workman
in
his
status
of,
and
here
i
am
using
a
phrase
of
judge
roaney's
in
the
local
725
decision,
which
enforced
the
board's
order
in
local
725
plumbers,
judge
roaney
said,
it
interferes
with
the
status
of
that
man
as
a
once
and
future
employee.
now,
that
was
arguably...
that
violation
was
presented
arguably
to
the
regional
director
when
this
man
came
to
the
regional
office,
and
what
the
regional
director
said
in
his
letter
was
not,
i
am
dismissing
the
8(b)(1)(a)
charge
because
i
find
that
you
never
were
an
employee.
he
said
the
union
didn't
cause
your
discharge.
that
is
relevant
to
the
finding
of
an
8(b)(1)(a),
and
if
the
union
didn't
cause
the
discharge,
if
the
business
agent
didn't
cause
the
discharge,
there
can't
be
any
coercion
of
the
man.
and
that's
what
he
said
here.
and
it
seems
anomalous
to
us
that
this
person
should
be
then
able,
that
the
appellee
should
then
be
able
to
go
to
the
georgia
court
and
say,
i
want
you
to
find
a
malicious
interference
with
contract
because
the
union
did
cause
my
discharge.
and
it
is
a
very
tricky
area.
if
there
was
not
an
8(b)(1)(a)
here,
if
this
is
in
the...
then
we
get
into
the
teamsters
against
morton...
congress
focused
upon
the
did
not
prescribe
area,
and
you
are
confronted
then
with
the
anomaly
that
the
man,
if
he
says
the
union
coerced
the
employer,
he
goes
to
the
board
and
gets
an
injunctive
remedy,
and
if
the
union
didn't
do
that,
he
goes
to
the
state
court
and
gets
punitive
damages.
now,
that
doesn't
seem
a
very
rational
aspect
of
any
scheme
congress
could
have
had
in
mind.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
it's--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--i
am
reluctant
to
commit
the
board,
but
i
would
say
that
this
particular
rationale
i
have
given
you
for
the
construction
industry--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--the
board
has
not
applied
that
theory
outside
the
construction
industry,
so
far
as
i
know.
they
are
talking
here...
but
i
think
they
would
apply
it
anywhere
where
you
had
a
situation
where
the
union...
where
those
fluctuations
of
status
in
the
union,
the
union's
show
of
power
in
one
area
would
tend
to
intimidate
him
as
an
employee.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
excuse
me?
i
am
not--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--yes,
the
8(b)(1)(a)
theory
would
not
apply.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
8(b)(1)(b)
would
still
be
active
here,
and
the
whole
problem
of
whether
there
is
a
congressional
scheme
that
is
being
unbalanced
by
what
the
state
court
is
doing.
but,
yes,
this
particular
8(b)(1)(a)
theory
that
i
have
outlined
to
you--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--would
not.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
think
on
these
other...
i
think
on
these
other
grounds
that
we've
discussed,
yes,
there
would
be.
as
i
think
has
been
demonstrated
here,
this
is
a
very
complicated
area,
and
the
line
between
what
congress
may
have
intended
to
permit
and
what
the
board
can
reasonably
in
applying
the
scheme
prohibit
is
just
very
close,
and
to
let
the
state
court
into
this
with
the
punitive
damage
remedy
just
does
not
seem
in
accord
with
this
court's
pre-emption
decisions.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
vice
president.
that
is
not
this
type
of
person.
that
is
not
the
type
of
person
that
had
been
involved
in
the
board's
construction
industry
cases,
and
probably
that
person...
if
the
union
had
no
leverage
over
that
person,
and
that
person
had
no
dependence
on
the
union,
this
8(b)(1)(a),
or
no
possibility
of
dependence
on
the
union,
this
8(b)(1)(a)
theory
i
am
outlining
to
you
probably
would
not
apply,
but
8(b)(1)(b)
would
certainly
still
apply,
and
as
i
say,
these
other
considerations
would.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
excuse
me.
well,
there
wouldn't
be
on
the
arguably
prohibited,
arguably
protected
area,
but
this
court
has
said
in
teamsters
against
morton
and
iam
against
wisconsin
employment
relations
commission
that
sometimes
you
have
a
very
finely
developed
congressional
scheme
which
can
be
disturbed
even
if
it
isn't
arguably--
