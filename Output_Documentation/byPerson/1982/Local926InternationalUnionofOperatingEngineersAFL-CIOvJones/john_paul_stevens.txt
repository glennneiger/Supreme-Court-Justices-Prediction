justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
ms.
stillman?
supposing
we
had
a
case,
and
i
recognize
in
your
view
we
don't,
which
did
not
involve
the
construction
industry
or
a
person
who
was
a
past
or
future
employee,
but
a
clear
supervisor,
and
no
argument
about
it,
and
that
therefore
there
was
no
section
7
right
involved.
what
would
your
view
be
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
the
board's
view
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
wouldn't
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
understand
you
to
be
saying
is,
you
would
not
contend
for
pre-emption
if
the
theory
of
the
charge
were
an
interference
with
the
employer's
right
to
select
his
supervisors
for
his
own
bargaining
representatives.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
theory
would
not
apply
if
the
theory
of
the...
of
the
charge
before
the
labor
board
had
been
based
on
a
claim
that
there
was
an
interference
with
the
employer's
right
to
pick
his
own
bargaining--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if...
but
you
would
still
claim
there
was...
say
there
was
pre-emption
in
the
hypothetical
that
i
posed,
and
i
think
justice
rehnquist
has--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--suppose
the
plaintiff
were
the
vice
president
of
the
company,
and
the
union
had
gotten
him
fired.
would
there
be
pre-emption?
