justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
suppose
you
would
argue
that
even
if
the
georgia
court
might
be
wrong,
it
nevertheless
only
erroneously
applied
settled
principles.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
we
don't
usually...
just
take
cases
to
correct
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think...
suppose
a
state
had
a
labor
law.
maybe
it
does.
and
suppose
it
almost
mirrors
the
federal
act.
and
once...
and
the
board
or
the
general
counsel
refuses
to
issue
a
complaint.
so
the
complaint
is
then
filed
with
the
state
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
the
federal
interest
has
been
satisfied.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no,
but
then
your...
i
don't
want
to
get
off
on
the
supervisor
ground,
because
that
isn't
the
ground
the
general
counsel
dealt
with.
he
said
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
union
has
caused
the
discharge,
and
then
the...
then
the
employee
or
the
supervisor,
whatever
he
is,
files
with
the
state
board
and
says
that
the
general
counsel
didn't
really
know
what
he
was
talking
about.
let's
really
have
a
hearing
here
and
go
at
it.
and
the
state
board
goes
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
the
federal
interest
has
been
exhausted,
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
that
is
a
different
ground.
now
you
are
moving
to
the
supervisor
ground.
suppose
he
wasn't
a
supervisor
at
all,
and
the
same
thing
happened.
he
went
to
the
board.
the
board
said
no,
no
evidence.
and
then
he
goes
to
the
state
board,
and
the
state
board
says,
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
here.
he
couldn't
do
that,
could
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
arguably
they've
interfered,
but
the
board
has
decided
he
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
the...
but
the
board
has
rejected
the
charge,
said
the
union
had
nothing
to
do
with
getting
him
fired.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right.
you
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
to
prove
coercion,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
necessary
to
prove
that
in
the
federal--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you
don't
have
to
prove
coercion.
you
can
still
win
without
proving
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the...
i
take
it
the
submission
is
that
even
if
you
could
win
under
the
state
cause
of
action
by
just
proving
causation--
justice
byron
r.
white
--rather
than
coercion--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
the
federal
law
pre-empts
that
because
a
union
should
be
free
to
cause
a
discharge
by
non-coercive
means?
is
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes,
but
the
general
counsel
did
say
that
there
was
no
causation.
not
only
there
was
no
coercion,
but
no
causation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
may
not
have
been,
but
that
is
what
he
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
he
had
issued
a
complaint
and
the
board
had
itself...
there
had
been
a
hearing,
and
the
board
had
decided
that
there
was
no
causation
whatsoever.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
federal...
all
they
had
to
find
in
the
federal
proceeding
was
that
there
was
no
coercion,
and
that
is
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
is
that
because
of
pre-emption,
or
because
of
some
notion
of
res
judicata?
justice
byron
r.
white
administrative
res
judicata?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gore,
could
i
ask
you
this
before
the
break?
suppose
a
union
goes
to
an
employer
and
says,
i
am
not
coercing
you
at
all,
but
i
just
request,
do
me
a
good
favor
and
fire
this
joker,
and
the
employer
says,
fine,
i
am
always
willing
to
do
a
favor
for
the
union.
the
employee
then...
has
the
union
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
against
the
employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
he
has
coerced
him,
hasn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
is
the...
what
is
the
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
is
found
that
the
union
actually
did
that,
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
8(b)(1)(a),
if
i
am
reading
my
bench
memo
right,
says
it
is
to
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
guaranteed
in
section
7.
now,
the
example
justice
white
gave,
i
would
think
it
may
be
coercion,
but
why
is
it
coercing
an
employee
in
their
exercise
of
a
right
given
by
section
7,
if
the
union
just
says,
you
know,
the
union
steward
just
says,
this
guy
ran
into
my
car
the
other
day
and
i
don't
like
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gold,
was
it
necessary
for
the
general
counsel
to
find
that
the
union
did
not
cause
the
discharge
as
well
as
that
the
union
did
not
coerce
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
coercion.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
union
to
go
around
to
the
employer
and
convince
him
non-coercively
to
discharge
an
employee,
not
a
supervisor?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
board
takes
the
position
that
a
breach
of
the
duty
to
represent
fairly
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case,
the
appellant
jones
brought
suit
in
a
georgia
state
court
against
the
appellee
union
which
had
a
collective
bargaining
contract
with
the
georgia
power
company.
the
--
jones
alleged
that
the
union
had
coerced
the
--
georgia
power
into
discharging
him
from
his
job
as
a
supervisor
and
thus
has
caused
the
company
to
breach
its
contract
with
him.
the
union
moved
to
dismissed
claiming
that
the
suit
could
not
go
forward
because
the
conduct
with
which
it
was
charged
was
an
arguable
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
was
therefore
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
trial
court
dismissed
the
case
but
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
suit
could
go
forward
because
among
other
things,
it
thought
the
conduct
was
not
an
arguable
unfair
practice.
we
postponed
jurisdiction
to
the
merits
and
we
now
hold
that
the
first
of
the
appeal
is
improper
but
treating
the
state
--
the
statement
of
jurisdiction
as
a
petition
for
certiorari,
we
grant
the
petition
and
go
on
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
georgia
court
for
the
reasons
that
we
stated
at
some
length
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
court.
in
our
view
the
conduct
that
is
involved
in
this
suit
was
an
arguable
unfair
practice
and
under
our
existing
cases
was
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
justices
powell
and
o'connor
have
joined
that
opinion.
