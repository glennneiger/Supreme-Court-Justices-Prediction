mr.
robert
f.
gore
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
very
briefly
to
the
jurisdictional
issue.
the
real
question
is,
is
this
case
important
enough
to
warrant
a
review
by
this
court
on
the
merits.
it
is
plaintiff's
position
that
it
is
not.
it
is
our
position
that
the
georgia
court
of
appeals,
after
carefully
reviewing
this
court's
prior
pre-emption
holdings,
properly
decided
the
case.
it
held
that
this
case
fit
within
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
pre-emption
doctrine.
in
fact,
in
the
exceptions
laid
down
in
the
garmon
case
itself,
it
held
that
because
he
was
a
supervisor,
the
plaintiff
was
a
supervisor,
it
was
only
of
peripheral
concern
to
the
act,
and
that
the
issue
was
deeply
seated
in
local
feelings...
there
is
a
citizen
of
georgia
who
has
been
deprived
of
his
right
to
work...
and
that
there
was
little
likelihood
of
interference
with
the
federal
labor
laws
because
the
federal
agency
had
already
had
a
look
at
it,
and
it
went
on
to
hold
that
there
were
different
causes
of
action
in
the
state
and
federal
forums.
it
did
not
create
a
new
exception
to
the
pre-emption
document.
it
found
a
limited
fact
situation
where
a
supervisor
who
has
pursued
his
derivative
federal
remedy
and
was
unsuccessful
could
then
file
a
state
court
lawsuit.
it
doesn't
open
the
floodgates
to
a
lot
of
state
court
actions,
and
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
properly
applied
the
law
and
reached
the
proper
decision.
this
case
does
not
merit
review.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
i
believe
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
a
little
broad
in
some
areas
where
they
pulled
some
phrases
out
of
various
places
that
could
have
been
tightened
up,
but
i
don't
think
that
is
appropriate
for
this
court.
i
would...
now,
turning
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
it
is
not
the
plaintiff's
position
that
this
case
began
with
his
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
it
began
when
the
union
interfered
with
his
contract
of
employment
as
a
supervisor.
now,
the
union
defendants
and
the
nlrb,
they
contend
that
the
perko
case,
which
is
almost
identical
with
this
case,
controls
this
case.
we
agree.
we
disagree,
however,
on
what
perko
stands
for.
i
think
we
would
all
agree
that
the
supervisor
must
initially
take
his
claim
to
the
federal
agency,
the
nlrb,
not
because
he
is
protected
by
the
federal
act,
because
he
is
not
protected
by
the
federal
act,
but
he
must
go
to
the
federal
agency
to
avoid
any
potential
conflict
between
the
federal
and
state
laws.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
well,
yes,
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
a
strange
doctrine,
but
it
flows
from
the
federal
labor
policy
that
they
don't
want
two
forums,
a
federal
and
a
state
forum,
looking
at
the
same
facts
where
there
are
potential
conflicting
decisions.
now,
we
don't
believe
there
is
a
potential
here
any
more
because
the
federal
agency
dropped
out.
the
federal
interests
dropped
out.
but
our
position
is--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--well,
the
federal
interest
that
is
involved
here
is
the
protection
of
certain
persons
under
the
act,
namely,
employees.
they
are
protected
by
section
8(b)(1)(a).
and
employers.
they
are
protected
by
8(b)(1)(b).
now,
if
there
is
no
evidence
or
insufficient
evidence
to
show
that
these
people
who
are
protected
by
the
act,
if
their
rights
have
not
been
violated,
federal
jurisdiction
no
longer
exists.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir,
but
not
in...
we
are
talking
here
of
a
union
unfair
labor
practice,
so
i
have
limited
it
to
that--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--yes.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
if
they
are
mirror
acts
of
each
other,
he
can't...
the
supervisor
in
that
instance--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--well,
does
the
state
act
protect
supervisors,
i
guess
would
be
the
real
criterion.
if
the
state
act
goes
further,
then
it
would
be--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--i
think
the
state
board--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--yes,
sir,
but
the
state
law
would
be
precluded
there
by
section
14(a).
mr.
robert
f.
gore
because
of
section
14(a)
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
14(a)
says
that
no
national
or
local
law
relating
to
collective
bargaining
will
make
supervisors
to
be
treated
as
employees.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
no,
sir,
but
in
georgia,
with
the
same
facts
here,
you've
made
him
an
employee
now.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
and
the
union
has
interfered
here.
when
the
union--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--but
it
would
have
never
gotten
to
the
board
because
of
the
state
right
to
work
law.
what
would
happen,
when
management
and
the
union
got
together
and
agreed
that
they
would
do
away
with
this
job
because
he
was
non-union,
they
reached
an
agreement,
and
that
was--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--but
that's
not
the
board's
area
where
it
should
be
looking.
it
should
be
looking
at
protected
persons.
the
supervisor
is
not
protected.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
well,
it
is
the
plaintiff's
position
that
the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
pre-emption
took
place,
but
whether
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
is
a
supervisor's
exclusive
forum
to
seek
relief
from
union
interference.
it
is
the
plaintiff's
position
that
if
the
nlrb
finds
that
the
union's
actions
did
not
violate
the
rights
of
persons
protected
by
the
federal
law,
employees
or
employers,
then
the
supervisor
is
free
to
pursue
his
private
cause
of
action
in
state
court.
this
is
true
for
two
reasons.
the
first,
congress,
when
it
removed
federal
protections
from
supervisors,
did
not
intend
to
give
the
unions
license
to
violate
supervisors'
rights
to
employment
contracts.
and
secondly,
the
causes
of
action
in
the
state
and
federal
forums
would
be
different.
now,
when
the
act
was
amended
in
1947,
congress
added
section
14(a)
in
direct
response
to
an
nlrb
holding
that
supervisors
were
employees.
14(a)
takes
supervisors
out
from
under
the
protections
of
the
act.
the
question,
we
believe,
is,
what
did
congress
intend?
congress
intended
that
employers
were
to
have
the...
could
require
complete
supervisor
loyalty.
they
were
not
required
to
retain
a
supervisor
who
had
divided
loyalties.
however,
neither
the
statutory
language
or
the
legislative
history
of
section
14(a)
support
the
proposition
that
supervisors
lost
all
their
common
law
rights.
they
lost
certain
rights
vis-a-vis
their
employer,
but
they
did
not
lose
all
their
rights
against
other
parties.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
give
unions
or
any
other
party
a
license
to
interfere
with
a
supervisor's
employment
contract.
supervisors
retain
their
common
law
rights.
however,
to
accommodate
federal
labor
law
policy,
these
common
law
rights
are
held
in
abeyance.
now,
the
second
reason
that
we
believe
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
are
not
exclusive
is
because
there
is
different
causes
of
action.
now,
both
forums
deal
with
the
same
facts.
they
both
deal
with
the
same
union
conduct.
but
their
focus
is
entirely
different.
there
are
different
elements
of
proof.
now,
the
federal
law
protects
employees
and
employers,
and
the
federal
inquiry
before
the
board
was,
did
the
union
conduct
restrain
or
coerce
employees.
the
plaintiff
had
no
evidence
that
the
employees
had
been
coerced.
in
fact,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
employees
even
knew
he
was
there.
and
the
plaintiff
had
no
direct
evidence
that
the
union
conduct
had
restrained
or
coerced
his
employers.
in
his
statement
to
the
board
when
specifically
asked
whether
he
had
any
direct
evidence,
he
said
he
believed
the
union
had
coerced
the
employer,
but
he
did
not
have
any
direct
evidence.
the
employer,
when
queried
by
the
board,
said,
we
were
not
coerced.
therefore,
the
federal
inquiry,
whether
employees
had
been
coerced
or
employers
had
been
coerced,
was
no
longer
there.
the
nlrb
no
longer
had
jurisdiction.
there
was
no
federal
cause
of
action.
and
the
regional
director
properly
dismissed
the
plaintiff's
charges.
now,
the
fact
is,
the
plaintiff
was
still
without
a
job,
but
that
was
irrelevant
to
the
federal
inquiry.
now,
the
regional
director
did
say
the
union
didn't
cause
it,
but
there
was
no
hearing.
his
look
at
the
facts
said
the
union
didn't
cause
your
discharge.
there
had
been
no
hearing
on
it,
no
discovery,
anything
that
the
plaintiff
could
pursue.
but
that
was
irrelevant
to
the
regional
director's
decision.
his
decision
was
that
there
is
no
evidence
or
insufficient
evidence
to
support
the
theory
that
the
employer
was
coerced.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
we
have
pursued
it
further
in
the
state
court,
and
we
haven't
come
up
with
any
further
evidence,
so
the
answer
i
don't
believe
is
no...
i
believe
is
no.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
well,
in
taking
the
depositions,
which
are
not
in
the
record,
of
some
of
the
management
officials,
they
vehemently
denied
that
they
were
coerced.
now,
we--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--no,
we
don't
have
to
prove
coercion
in
the
state
plan.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
exactly
right,
and
that
brings
us
to
paragraph
6
in
our
complaint.
we
used
the
term
"coercion",
but
when
we
are
back
at
the
state
trial
court,
i
don't
believe
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
prove
coercion.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
no,
sir.
it
has
four
elements.
it
has
the
contract
of
employment.
we
have
to
prove,
which
i
believe
we
can
very
easily,
that
the
union
defendants
knew
of
this
contract.
i
think
that
is
fairly
obvious
from
the
regional
director's
letter.
that
the
union
defendants
intentionally
interfered
with
the
contract.
and
that
the
employer
terminated
the
contract,
damaging
the
plaintiff.
that
is
what
we
have
to
prove
there.
now,
we
overpleaded
it
because
we
put
in
coercion
in
the
state
cause
of
action,
but
whether
employees
or
employers
were
coerced
is
irrelevant
to
our
private
cause
of
action.
now,
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
review
the
sears
decision,
because
in
one
portion
of
that
decision
there
was
a
discussion
about
different
causes
of
action
or
the
different
inquiries.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
no,
sir,
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
protected
activity.
what
we
believe
to
be
the
case
is
that
this
was
a
private
vendetta
by
a
union
official,
and
he
used
his
union
position
to
block
the
employment
rights
of
the
plaintiff.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
regarding
the
employee
concerns
that
the
plaintiff
was
going
to
be
a
supervisor.
the
employees
didn't
even
know
the
plaintiff
was
going
to
be
a
supervisor.
there
is
evidence,
however,
that
the
defendant
archer,
the
union
official,
objected
to
the
plaintiff's
employment
because
four
years
earlier,
after
he
and
the
plaintiff
had
had
a
dispute
over
a
job,
the
plaintiff
abandoned
the
union
and
went
to
work
for
a
non-union
contractor.
now,
the
federal
law
does
not
protect
private
vendettas
or
union
blacklisting.
now,
the
defendant
union
urges
that
employees
have
a
protected
right
to
complain
about
who
is
a
supervisor.
in
the
abstract,
that
may
very
well
be
true,
but
this
is
not
the
case
here.
the
employees
didn't
even
know
that
the
plaintiff
was
going
to
be
their
supervisor.
this
is
strictly
a
private
vendetta.
it
is
not
protected
activity.
and
it
is
a
state
tort,
and
properly
belongs
in
the
state
tort.
during
the
questioning
there
were
some
questions
regarding
the
plaintiff's
failure
to
appeal
the
dismissal
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
perko
requires
that
the
plaintiff
initially
pursue
his
relief
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
plaintiff
did.
he
presented
his
evidence
to
the
regional
director.
he
had
no
evidence
that
the
employees
had
been
coerced.
he
believed
that
the
employer
had
been
coerced.
he
had
no
direct
evidence.
the
employer
said,
i
was
not
coerced.
so,
since
there
was
no
employee
coercion,
no
employer
coercion,
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
there
had
been
no
hearing
on
that,
justice
white.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
but
it...
i
don't
think
that
is
essential
to--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--we
are
out
of
court.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
because
we
have
had
our
look
at
the
federal
law.
we
have
had
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--i
think
if
we
had
a
hearing
on
the
merits,
and
we
took
it
up
to
the
board,
and
took
it
to
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--i
think
it
would
be
more
of
res
judicata.
we
have
had
our
day
in
court.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
well,
we
would
have
certainly
appealed
it
on
up,
but
yes,
sir.
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
plaintiff,
because
the
regional
director
was
correct
in
dismissing
the
complaint,
was
not
required
to
appeal
on
up
to
the
board.
i
would
like
to
address
just
a
moment
to
the
construction
industry
argument
that
is
being
urged
by
the
nlrb.
this
is
not
a
construction
industry
case
in
regards
to
the
plaintiff.
he
was
a
supervisor.
true,
he
worked
in
the
construction
industry.
he
had
been
a
supervisor
for
almost
three
years
with
another
employer.
georgia
power
went
over
and
hired
him
away
from
another
employer
to
come
in
as
a
high
level
supervisor.
the
discussions
they
had
was,
it
was
going
to
be
an
eight
to
ten-year
job.
there
was
no
written
contract
of
employment,
but
it
was
a
long-term
employment.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
georgia
power
and
the
construction
trades
specifically
provides
that
they
have
the
absolute
right
to
hire
who
they
want
as
supervisors,
and
that
supervisors
don't
have
to
go
through
the
hiring
hall.
so,
the
discussion
here,
they
are
trying
to
bring
it
over
into
a
construction
industry
scenario
when
it
doesn't
really
belong
there
as
to
this
plaintiff.
this
is
a
long-term
supervisor
who
was
going
to
be
there
for
a
long
time
but
for
the
union's
interference.
in
summary,
it
is
our
position
that
the--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--i
think
we
are
arguing
the
facts,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
record,
it
shows
that
they
talked
in
terms
of
an
eight
to
ten-year
employment
record,
and
we
have
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
the
record
down
at
the
trial
court,
that
the
employer
has
the
absolute
right
to
hire
who
it
wants,
and
that
the
supervisors
are
not
to
go
through
the
hiring
hall.
so,
as
to
this
supervisor,
the
plaintiff,
i
don't
believe
it
is
a
construction
industry
case.
true,
the
people
who
may
work
under
him
are
going
to
be
going
in
and
out
of
the
hiring
hall.
in
summary,
we
believe
the
decision
of
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
does
not
merit
review
by
this
court.
they
correctly
applied
this
court's
prior
holdings,
and
they
correctly
decided
the
case.
however,
should
the
court
decide
to
review
the
case
on
the
merits,
i
would
like
to
draw
attention
to
one
sentence
in
the
lockridge
dissent.
"where
persons
with
otherwise
justiciable
claims
cannot
obtain
a
hearing
under
the
law,
the
law
is
subject
to
close
scrutiny
to
discover
the
circumstances
compelling
such
a
result.
"
now,
when
the
court
closely
scrutinizes
this
law,
it
will
find
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
strip
supervisors
of
their
common
law
rights
to
seek
redress
from...
for
intentional
torts,
and
that
after
a
supervisor
is
unsuccessful
in
obtaining
relief
under
a
derivative
federal
cause
of
action,
he
can
pursue
his
own
private
cause
of
action
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
was
this
a
supervisor?
mr.
robert
f.
gore
and
this
was
an
employee?
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
i
believe
it
has.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
he
has...
he
has
requested
that
the
employer
discriminate
based
on
some
irrelevant...
well,
not
irrelevant--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--that
the
union
has
approached
the
employer
and
asked
him
to
discriminate
against
an
employee.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
that
would
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
there.
i
was
under
possibly
the
mistaken
impression
that
you
were
talking
about
his
union
affiliation
and
status.
