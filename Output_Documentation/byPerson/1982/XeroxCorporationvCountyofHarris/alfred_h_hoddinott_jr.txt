mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
concerns
xerox
copiers
that
were
always
in
foreign
commerce,
never
in
domestic
commerce
or
part
of
the
common
mass
of
property
in
the
state
of
texas,
paused
only
temporarily
in
texas,
and
were
stored
in
a
customs
bonded
warehouse,
always
under
the
custody
and
control
of
the
united
states
customs
service.
the
issue
is
whether
texas
can
assert
property
taxes
without
violating
the
commerce
clause
and
the
import
export
clause
on
goods
in
that
warehouse.
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
said
that
it
could.
it
was
wrong.
the
facts
are
essentially
undisputed.
xerox
manufactures
copiers
domestically
and
assembles
them
abroad.
the
latin
american
free
trade
association
requires
the
assembly
of
goods
in
member
countries.
as
a
result,
xerox
decided
to
build
copiers
in
mexico
to
compete
in
latin
america.
initially,
it
stored
those
copiers
in
the
panama
canal
zone,
but
because
of
anti-american
feeling
there,
it
sought
to
store
them
elsewhere.
it
decided
to
switch
to
a
customs
bonded
warehouse
in
houston.
physically,
these
copiers
were
assembled
in
mexico,
trucked
by
a
bonded
carrier
to
houston,
stored
in
a
customs
bonded
warehouse
in
houston,
anywhere
from
a
few
days
to
three
years,
but
always
less
than
the
time
permitted
by
the
customs
statutes.
as
orders
were
received,
the
copiers
were
trucked
by
a
bonded
carrier
to
the
ship,
and
then
to
latin
america.
because
of
the
way
the
copiers
were
packaged
and
built,
they
could
not
be
used
domestically.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
it
is
a
warehouse
that
is
maintained
by
a
warehouseman.
he
supplies
bonds
to
the
customs
service
that
goods
that
are
retained
in
there
will
not
go
out
into
domestic
commerce,
and
they
are...
the
goods
are
under
the
custody
and
control
of
a
customs
employee.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
yes.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
generally,
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
this
one
certainly
was.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
there
are,
i
believe,
eight
customs
bonded
warehouses,
your
honor,
and
they
are
for
varying
purposes.
some
are
just
straight
storage.
some
are
manufacturing
warehouses.
i
believe
there
are
smelting
warehouses.
they
are
broken
up
by
their
purpose,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
money,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
it's
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states.
they
were
to
guarantee
the
payment
of
the
duties.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
the
record
is
silent
on
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
that
either.
your
honor,
it
is
conceded
that
not
one
of
these
copiers
ever
entered
domestic
markets.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
these
were
not.
it
is
conceded
that
not
one
entered
domestic
markets,
not
one
was
sold
for
domestic
use--
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
--because
they
are
totally
in
foreign
commerce,
and
all
of
the
interstate
commerce
cases
that
have
been
cited
by
the
appellees,
i
submit,
are
inapplicable,
and
this
court
has
said
in
japan
line,
your
honor,
that
the
constitutional
analysis
will
be
more
extensive
when
it
is
foreign
commerce.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
they
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
in
1976
and...
for
1976
and
1977,
the
appellees
taxed
xerox
with
respect
to
these
copiers
approximately
$280,000
on
the
full
value
of
the
goods.
xerox
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
and
injunctive
relief
in
1977,
alleging
that
the
taxes
violated
the
commerce
clause
and
the
import
export
clauses
of
the
constitution
because
the
goods
were
in
transit.
the
trial
court
agreed.
it
said,
"given
the
peculiar
status
of
the
copiers
in
the
factual
context
of
foreign
commerce,
they
are
not
taxable
because
they
do
not
have
a
substantial
nexus
with
houston
and
have
not
left
the
palpable
flow
of
foreign
commerce.
"
"in
short,
they
were
still
in
transit
and
in
foreign
commerce.
"
that
finding
is
controlling
under
texas
law
unless
it
is
manifestly
erroneous.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
record
shows
that
they
were
there
anywheres
from
eight
days
to
approximately
three
years,
as
was
permitted
by
the
customs
statute.
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
reversed
on
appeal,
and
decided
that
taxes
were
constitutional,
and
entered
a
judgment
against
xerox
on
the
appellee's
counterclaims,
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
found
no
reversible
error.
two
key
facts
permeate
this
case,
we
submit.
first,
under
the
commerce
clause,
only
congress
regulates
foreign
commerce,
and
this
is
foreign
commerce.
we
can...
there
is
no
serious
dispute
that
factually
the
goods
are
in
foreign
commerce.
they
start
in
mexico.
they
pass
through
texas,
and
they
went
on
to
latin
america
on
a
continuous
journey.
they
were
never
legally
imported.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
i
submit
they
are,
your
honor,
because
the
law
is
that
until
they
pass
the
barrier
of
paying
the
customs
duty,
it
is
as,
as
this
court
said,
it
is
as
they...
as
if
they
never
came
into
the
country,
they
were
detained
at
the
border,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that,
your
honor,
but
the
owner
of
that
warehouse
is
also
taxed,
and
we
submit
that
houston's
services
are
supported
by
the
common
carrier
that
was
used,
by
the
warehouseman,
by
the
stevedores,
all
of
whom,
we
submit,
are
undoubtedly
taxed
by
houston.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
follow
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
when
you
say
destined,
your
honor,
if
they
had
already
passed
the
customs
barrier,
and
the
duties
had
been
paid,
then
i
would
agree,
but
until
the
customs
duties
are
paid,
i
submit
they
are
not
taxable.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
no.
but
it...
the
customs
statutes
permit
storage
for
three
years,
and
it
makes
a
difference
as
long
as
they
were
there
for
the
three
years
permitted
by
congress.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
i
submit
that
is
so,
your
honor,
and
i
also
submit
that
as
this
court
said
in
japan
line
where
you
are
talking
about
foreign
commerce,
where
there
is
a
need
for
federal
uniformity,
that
texas's
remedy
is
with
congress,
because
we
are
talking
about
foreign
commerce.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
precisely,
your
honor.
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
they
might
as
well
be
on
a
ship
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean,
and
that's
what
the
cases
have
held,
that
until--
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
--absolutely,
your
honor.
absolutely.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
because
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
pursuant
to
the
warehousing
act
of
1846,
congress
has
said,
we
want
to
encourage
foreign
commerce,
and
in
order
to
encourage
that
foreign
commerce,
we
want
to
have
transshipment
of
goods
through
our
ports,
and
to
encourage
that
transshipment,
they
said,
you
may
keep
those
goods
there
for
three
years.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
that
is
certainly
one
of
our
arguments,
your
honor.
the
second
important
point
besides
the
fact
that
this
is
foreign
commerce
is
the
very
nature
of
the
customs
bonded
warehouse,
some
of
which
we
have
referred
to.
as
the
court
is
aware,
there
are
detailed
statutes
and
regulations
concerning
customs.
the
court
has
held
in
board
of
trustees
versus
united
states
and
in
mcgoldrick
that
customs
is
a
subject
of
complete
federal
regulation,
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
hard
to
imagine
more
complete
regulation
than
when
the
united
states
government
has
physical
custody
and
control
of
your
goods.
the
legislative
history
establishes
that
customs
bonded
warehouses
have
a
unique
place
in
foreign
commerce
and
are
part
of
the
total
regulation
of
customs.
the
warehouses
were
established
by
the
1846
warehousing
act
to,
as
congress
said,
unfetter
commerce.
it
had
several
purposes.
one,
is
was
to
alleviate
the
burden
of
the
then
current
requirement
that
all
duties
on
shipments
be
paid
at
one
time,
but
second,
as
i
referred
to,
justice
o'connor,
it
was
to
encourage
the
use
of
u.s.
ports
and
ships,
and
that
was
to
be
accomplished
by
permitting
storage
of
cargoes
in
warehouses
for
up
to
three
years,
and
then
transshipment
of
the
goods
without
the
imposition
of
any
duty.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
i
believe
it
would,
sir.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
yes,
i
would,
sir.
the
cases
are
clear--
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
--i
think
there
is
a
risk,
your
honor,
perhaps
not
with
respect
to
xerox,
because
xerox
is
a
domestic
corporation.
had
xerox
been
a
japanese
corporation,
i
submit
there
would
be
substantial
risks
of
multiple
taxation
that
would
be
applicable.
the
warehousing
act
and
all
of
its
subsequent
legislation
delegated
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
duty
to
formulate
regulations
to
carry
out
congress's
intent.
starting
in
1915,
the
treasury
regulations
prohibited
state
taxation
of
goods
in
customs
bonded
warehouses.
your
honor,
last
friday
it
came
to
my
attention
that
on
a
week
ago
monday,
november
1st,
the
relevant
customs
statutes...
regulations
were
amended.
that
appears
at
19
cfr...
47
federal
register,
page
49,370.
in
that
amendment,
the
footnote
to
19
cfr
19.6,
which
granted
a
state
tax
immunity,
was
deleted.
the
background
information
about
the
amendment
published
by
the
treasury
department
is
silent
as
to
why
the
footnote
is
no
longer
there.
we
believe--
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
--we
believe
that
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
brief,
however,
the
regulation
was
still
controlling
during
the
relevant
time
period,
and
as
this
court
said
in
mcgoldrick,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
treasury
regulation
merely
reflects
congress's
intent
to
free
the
warehouses
from
state
tax.
in
1940,
this
court
examined
the
entire
structure
of
customs
bonded
warehouses
in
the
mcgoldrick
case.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
the
date
was
november
1st,
your
honor.
the
citation
is
47
federal
register
49,370.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
of
this
year.
it
becomes
effective
december
1.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
sir.
we
just
felt
it
was
our
duty
to
call
this
to
the
court's
attention.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
we
believe
at
the
least
it
is
that,
your
honor.
i
think
it
could
be
controlling
in
its
own...
in
its...
by
its
own
force,
but
i
don't
think
its
deletion
is
in
any
way
fatal
to
our
case.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
since
the
treasury
department
did
not
say
why
they
were
deleting
it,
it
may
be
an
oversight
for
all
i
know,
so
i
can't
say
that
it
is
relevant,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
no.
as
to
one
appellee,
it
was
one
year;
as
to
the
other
appellee,
it
was
two
years.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
they
have,
sir.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
know
where
they
have
gone
now,
sir.
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
i'd
rather
not
answer
that
one,
sir.
we
believe
that
congress's
intent
in
1977
was
no
different
than
it
was
in
the
mcgoldrick
case
in
1940.
as
in
1940,
congress
intended
that
goods
in
foreign
commerce
and
in
these
warehouses
should
be
free
from
state
taxation.
we
believe
mcgoldrick
should
be
adhered
to
not
just
because
it's
there,
but
because
it's
reasonable
and
it's
right.
congress
can
hardly
administer
the
customs
laws
where
it
is
obviously
regulating
foreign
commerce
if
every
state
can
have
its
say,
have
its
tax
along
the
way.
the
customs
law
are
a
national
concern
requiring
national
administration.
the
system
cannot
survive
with
unilateral
state
interference.
therefore,
these
taxes
violate
the
commerce
clause.
but
if
the
taxes
somehow
pass
muster
under
the
commerce
clause,
they
still
violate
the
import
export
clause
where
the
constitution
prohibits
imposts
or
duties
on
imports
or
exports.
the
court
has
recently
examined
state
property
taxes
under
this
provision,
and
in
michelin
it
said
state
taxes
would
be
prohibited
if
goods
are
in
transit,
and
in
japan
line
it
said,
state
taxes
are
prohibited
where
it
destroys
the
federal
government's
one
voice
on
foreign
commerce.
the
first
issue
under
this
clause
has
been
conceded.
the
city
concedes
that
state
taxes
on
goods
in
transit
violate
the
commerce
and
import
export
clauses
at
its
brief,
page
14,
and
that
just
makes
sense.
the
goods
do
not
have
a
substantial
nexus
with
the
state
for
taxation,
and
it
would
hinder
the
free
flow
of
foreign
commerce.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
as
applicable
to
this
case,
these
goods
are
in
foreign
commerce,
and
irrespective
of
what
the
court
said
in
michelin,
always
there
is
some
nexus.
there
is
always
some
connection
with
the
state,
and
we
submit
that
goods
in
a
bonded
warehouse
don't
have
that
connection.
we
submit
that
xerox's
copiers
are
in
transit
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
the
trial
court
so
held,
but
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
held
to
the
contrary
without
finding
the
trial
court's
findings
manifestly
erroneous.
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
by
operation
of
law,
goods
in
a
bonded
warehouse
have
no
taxable
nexus.
they
are
still
in
foreign
commerce.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
they
went
to
a
free
trade
zone
in
buffalo,
new
york.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
a
free
trade
zone
is
a
creature
of
the
united
states
congress
that
were
set
up
by
an
act
of
congress
in
1934.
they
are
set
aside...
it's
an
area
of
land
set
aside,
fenced
off,
that--
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
--no,
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
quite
often
they
are
owned
by
cities
and
counties
and
that
sort.
as
we
point
out
in
the
footnote
in
our
reply
brief,
the
legislative
history
reveals
that
they
are
substantially
the
same
as
customs
bonded
warehouses.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
assume
that
a
person
who
operates
the
free
trade
zone
may
have
to
do
so,
but
i
don't
know.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
the
bond
in
effect
says
i
will
pay
the
customs
duties
if
these
goods
are
brought
into
the
united
states.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
that's
right.
if
they
are
removed
from
the
warehouse
back
into
foreign
commerce,
there
is
no
duty
payable.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
in
the
bond?
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
sir.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
we
believe
that
xerox's
copiers
were
in
transit.
the
courts
have
consistently
held
that
when
they
are
in
a
customs
bonded
warehouse,
it
is
as
if
they
were
detained
at
the
border.
the
cases
cited
by
appellees
and
by
the
court
below
all
related
to
interstate
commerce,
where
the
goods
fell
into
some
state
when
the
journey
ended
or
where
it
was...
or
it
was
there
before
the
journey
started.
those
cases
would
be
applicable
to
xerox
only
if
the
goods
cleared
customs
and
entered
interstate
commerce.
the
state
can
stand
at
the
warehouse
door,
and
the
moment
the
goods
pass
through,
it
can
assert
its
tax,
but
those
cases
involving
interstate
commerce
are
not
applicable
until
then,
and
our
goods
were
still
passing
in
foreign
commerce.
the
county
reads
the
michelin
case
to
permit
virtually
all
property
taxes.
we
submit
it
is
just
not
that
broad.
it
holds
taxes
not
per
se
illegal,
but
it
doesn't
say
they
are
per
se
legal
either.
therefore,
whether
xerox's
copiers
were
in
transit
or
not,
the
taxes
must
pass
the
michelin
three-part
test,
especially
the
one
concerning
one
voice.
the
court
said
a
tax
is
unconstitutional
if
it
obstructs
the
federal
government
from
speaking
with
one
voice
on
foreign
commercial
affairs.
these
taxes
fail
that
test.
since
1846
in
its
control
of
foreign
commerce
congress
promoted
that
commerce
by
encouraging
transshipment
of
goods
through
our
ports,
with
the
goods
being
stored
temporarily
in
the
customs
bonded
warehouses.
in
essence,
it
said
to
the
world,
come
use
our
ports,
we
will
not
tax
you,
we
will
not
charge
you
customs
duties
if
you
will.
but
now
texas
wants
to
assert
a
tax,
y
percent,
california
perhaps
z
percent,
new
york
perhaps
no
tax.
each
state
wants
to
have
its
own
say.
but
how
can
the
nation
speak
with
one
voice
under
these
circumstances?
that
clamor
is
not
one
voice.
in
japan
line,
this
court
held
that
the
states
cannot
frustrate
federal
uniformity,
but
if
every
state
can
make
its
own
unilateral
decision,
it
would
obviously
make
speaking
with
one
voice
impossible.
that
just
can't
be.
these
taxes
fall
on
that
ground
alone.
finally,
the
appellees
complain
they
are
being
forced
to
offer
services
without
revenue,
that
they
just
want
xerox
to
pay
its
fair
share.
well,
again,
the
appellees
are
confusing
interstate
commerce
and
foreign
commerce,
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
japan
line,
the
fair
share
cases
involved
interstate
commerce,
not
foreign
commerce.
while
the
burdens
of
state
government
are
a
concern,
this
court
specifically
rejected
those
arguments
when
they
were
asserted
in
japan
line,
and
the
court
concluded
that
where
foreign
commerce
and
the
national
interests
are
burdened,
congress
and
not
the
individual
states
must
control.
this
is
just
such
a
case.
the
state's
remedy
is
in
congress,
and
not
through
unilateral
self-help.
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
when
you
look
at
this
case
and
boil
it
all
down,
certain
principles
control
its
disposition.
one,
congress
intended
goods
in
a
customs
bonded
warehouse
to
be
free
from
state
taxation.
two,
the
mcgoldrick
case
is
both
right
and
applicable.
three,
state
taxation
of
goods
in
transit
is
prohibited,
and
xerox's
copiers
were
in
transit.
and
four,
these
taxes
prevent
congress
from
speaking
with
one
voice.
to
prevail,
the
appellees
must
convince
you
that
every
one
of
those
principles
is
wrong.
if
they
fail
as
to
even
one,
the
case
should
be
reversed.
we
submit
they
fail
as
to
them
all.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
i
would
be
happy
to
try
and
answer
justice
blackmun's
question.
the
copiers
could
be
worked
over
at
a
cost
of
over
$100.
it
is
not
impossible
for
them
to
be
used
domestically,
but
it
would
be
somewhat
like
justice
berger's
automobile.
presumably
there
is
some
way
to
switch
the
steering
wheel
from
the
right
hand
to
the
left
hand.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
you
couldn't
use
the
xerox
copier
just
the
way
it
was--
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
--because
of
the
electricity.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
goods
that
come
from
abroad
coming
into
the
united
states
may
be
held
for
up
to
three
years
and
then
brought
in.
indeed,
that
is--
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
--no
matter
where
they
are
destined.
that
is
indeed
the
legislative
purpose
that
is
set
forth
in
the
warehousing
act,
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
the
minute
it
passes
through
the
warehouse
door,
your
honor.
once
they
are
into...
pass
through
the
warehouse
door--
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
--no.
while
they
are
stored--
mr.
alfred
h.
hoddinott,
jr.
--no,
sir,
that
is
directly
opposed
to
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
warehousing
act.
