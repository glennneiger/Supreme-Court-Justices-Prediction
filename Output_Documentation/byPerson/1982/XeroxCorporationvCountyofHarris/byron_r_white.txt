you
just
thought
it
was
surplusage
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
thought
the
footnote
was
surplusage
anyway.
it
just
was
a
reflection
of
what
the
regulation
would
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
me,
if
you
know,
why
the
federal
government
provides
for
free
trade
zones
in
addition
to
bonded
warehouses?
was
there
some
reason
for
providing
free
trade
zones?
why
wouldn't
the
bonded
warehouse
serve
the
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
can't
really
work
on
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
i
gather
they
even
build
factories,
perhaps,
in
free
trade
zones,
do
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
bonded
warehouse
isn't
available,
is
it,
for
an
importer
who
simply
wants
to
store
his
goods
in
a
bonded
warehouse
pending
domestic
distribution?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
can
bring
your
goods
in
and
delay
the
payment
of
duty
until
you
get
a
market
for
it
in
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
a
company
can
just
get
cheaper
warehousing
by
using
a
bonded
warehouse.
it
just
depends
on
what
the
cost
of
the
bond
is
as
compared
to
the
domestic
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
this
case
as
to
whether
they
were
destined
for
a
foreign
market.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
sue
them
in
another
state.
you
could
chase
them
down.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
is
the
county
tax
separate,
a
different
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
does
the
state
impose
a
tax,
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
are
three
taxes
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
so
there
are
at
least
three.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
true
that...
is
it
true
that
the
bonded
warehouse
can
be
used
by
an
importer
who
wants
to
distribute
domestically?
can
he
use
the
bonding
warehouse
just
to
postpone
the
payment
of
his
duties
until
he
gets
a
domestic
market?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
where
they
are
destined.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
would
you
say
that
texas
could
levy
its
tax
on
the
importer
who
is...
who
intends
to
take
these
goods
into
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
to
be
stored?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
an
importer
who
says,
yes,
these
are
going
to
be
sold
in
the
united
states,
and
he
puts
them
in
a
bonded
warehouse,
and
holds
them
for
two
years,
may
texas
levy
a
tax
while
they
are
in
the
warehouse?
