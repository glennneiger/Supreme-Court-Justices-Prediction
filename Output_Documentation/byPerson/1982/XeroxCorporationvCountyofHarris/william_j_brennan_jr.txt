justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
nature
of
the
bond?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it?
and
to
whom...
for
the
benefit
of
whom?
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
your
basic
point,
i
gather,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
import
and
export
clause,
that
is
unlike
michelin
tires,
for
example,
which
were...
i
gather,
from
the
domestic
market.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
are
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
why
do
you
say
that
makes
a
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
show
how
long
some
of
these
machines
remained
in
the
warehouse?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather,
mr.
hoddinott,
you
would
regard
that
as
simply
a
regulation
by
congress
to
that
extent
of
foreign
commerce.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
federally
owned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
original
package,
ms.
chapman?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ms.
chapman,
for
what
year...
i
gather...
is
it
the
city's
tax
or
the
county's
that
is
for
one
year?
which
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
year
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
seventy-seven.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
these
are
copiers
that
were
there
from
'74
until
'77?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
happened
in
'77
that
caused
you
to
impose
the
tax
that
year
and
not
in
'76
or
'75?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
that's
michelin.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
decision
that
year.
now,
in
'77,
as
of
what
date
did
you
impose
the
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
1977.
and
the
copiers
were
still
there
on
that
date.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
4,000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you
imposed
the
tax
then
as
of
january
1,
1977.
what
did
you
do
about
trying
to
collect
the
tax
assessed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
and
so
you
have
never
actually
tried
to
collect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
well,
presumably
you
have
levied
the
tax.
the
tax
levy
was
made
on
january
1.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ms.
chapman,
maybe
this
isn't
relevant
and
i
shouldn't
take
your
time
with
it,
but
suppose
then
xerox,
come
december
31,
1977,
you
have
not
yet
tried
to
enforce
payment
of
the
tax,
and
they
move
the
copiers
up
to
new
york,
as
i
gather
they
did.
how
do
you
collect
your
tax?
you
sue
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
you
can't
get
them
in
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
have
been
thinking
about,
ms.
chapman,
justice
stevens
mentioned,
suppose
it
was
a
japanese
company
that
had
done
this?
