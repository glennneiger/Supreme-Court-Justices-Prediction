mr.
hoddinott,
may
i
interrupt
you?
what
was
the
date
of
the
deletion
of
that
footnote?
i
missed
it
as
you
explained
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
november
1st
of
this
year?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
thank
you.
oh,
so
the
footnote
is
still
in
effect
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hoddinott,
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
what
happened
when...
after
you
found
you
had
to
pay
this
tax,
or
at
least
they
were
assessing
it?
you
emptied
the
warehouses,
and
does
the
record
tell
us
where
the
material
went
when
it
came
out
of
the
warehouses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
mean
by
a
free
trade
zone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
to
put
up
any
kind
of
a
bond
when
they
are
in
a
free
trade
zone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
justice
brennan
touched
on
this
earlier,
but
i
want
to
be
clear
in
my
own
mind.
what
is
the
condition
of
the
bond
when
it
is
put
up
when
it
is
in
a
bonded
warehouse?
what
does
the
bond
in
effect
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
if
they
are
removed
from
the
warehouse.
it
is
just
if
they
are
brought
into
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
and
there
is
no
mention
of
any
possible
state
tax
liability
in
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
bond
or
the
warehousing
documents?
there
wouldn't
be,
would
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
concessions
does
texas
give
those
who
use
the
free
trade
zones
in
texas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
do
you
contend
that
the
state
could
levy
the
tax,
though,
before
the
federal
government
could
collect
the
duty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
say
you'd
have
to
wait
until
the
federal
government
collected
a
duty,
supposing
the
goods
were
still
under
a
bond,
within
the
three
year
period.
when
would
you
collect
the
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
all
the
copiers
were
still
in
texas
at
the
time
you
levied
the
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
you
did
seek
to
collect
the
tax
before
the
federal
government
was
free
to
collect
any
duty.
assuming
these
goods
were
going
to
go
for
domestic
distribution.
we
assessed
those
goods
for
taxation.
we
have
not...
we
did
not
attempt
to
enforce
our
lien
for
taxes,
and
we
do
not
believe
under
federal
law
we
can
unless
the
federal
government's
right
to
revenues
are
assured,
are
protected,
and
unless...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
one
of
the
cases
cited--
--assume
they
had
no
other
property
in
texas.
now,
i
understand
in
fact
they
did
keep
other
property
there,
but
would
you
in
effect
have
a
second
mortgage
on
all
the
goods
while
they
were
being
stored
in
texas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
would
be
true
even
if
these
were
goods...
if
it
were
not
an
american
company,
but
a
japanese
company,
for
example,
that
shipped
in
some
product
which
it
then
intended
to
transship
to
mexico,
and
it
was...
you
would
say
you
could
impose
a
lien
on
those
shipments.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
long,
in
your
view,
would
it
take
for
the
goods
to
acquire
a
taxable
situs?
