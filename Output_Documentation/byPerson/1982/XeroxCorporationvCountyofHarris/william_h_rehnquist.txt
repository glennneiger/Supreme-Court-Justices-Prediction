mr.
hoddinott,
you
used
the
term
"customs
bonded
warehouse
in
houston",
and
i
know
the
court
of
civil
appeals
opinion
certainly
speaks
in
those
terms,
too.
is
there
any
generic
description
you
can
give
of
a
customs
bonded
warehouse?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
warehouseman
generally
a
private
individual?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
about
the
building
in
which
it
is
stored?
is
that
generally
a
privately
owned
building?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
ones
that
were
there
in
three
years?
is
it
really
accurate
to
talk
about
them
as
being
on
a
continuous
journey
if
they
spent
three
years
in
houston?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
during
that
time,
i
presume
that
the
houston
fire
department
and
the
houston
police
department
would
have
to
come
to
the
aid
of
the
owner
of
the
private
warehouse
in
the
event
there
was
a
break-in
and
xerox's
goods
were
going
to
be
stolen,
or
in
the
event
there
was
a
fire
that
would
have
destroyed
xerox's
goods.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
that
this
is
different
even
though
xerox's
stuff,
if
it
had
been
destined
for
domestic
use,
you
have
paid
taxes
on
it
and
it
would
be
taxable.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
same
amount
of
xerox
computers
had
been
stored
in
exactly
the
same
warehouse
but
destined
for
domestic
use,
you,
of
course,
have
paid
taxes
on
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
makes
no
difference
to
your
case
even
if
they
were
in
the
houston
warehouse
for
20
years,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hoddinott,
i
see
in
a
footnote
to
your
brief
on
page
12
you
mention
that
in
1978
congress
extended
the
period
from
three
years
to
five
years.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
that
cover
your
case
if
it
had
been
in
effect
when
this
situation
arose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
you
could
then
store
goods
in
houston
for
five
years,
at
least
five
years
under
your
theory.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
shows
what
a
big
state
texas
is.
