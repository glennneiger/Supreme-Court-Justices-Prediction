justice

mr.
hoddinott,
in
japan
lines,
the
court
said
that
california's
tax
on
cargo
containers
that
were
only
in
the
state
less
than
three
weeks
would
pass
muster
under
the
commerce
clause,
and
were
not
in
transit.
how
can
you
argue
that
absent
the
regulatory
scheme
here,
these
things
would
be
in
transit
under
the
commerce
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
are
resting
your
argument
on
the
possible
interference
with
national
foreign
policy
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hoddinott,
is
there
any
risk
of
foreign
retaliation
against
the
united
states
for
a
tax
policy
of
local
government
like
this
if
there
are
american
goods
stored
in
some
foreign
country?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hoddinott,
if
we
adopted
your
view
of
the
meaning
of
in
transit
under
the
import
export
clause,
wouldn't
we
be
resurrecting
low
against
austin?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
but
you
are
not
sure
whether
that...
your
policy
today
would
be
to
tax
goods
in
the
free
trade
zone
or
not.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
mcgoldrick
case,
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
court
relied
on
the
footnote
to
the
regulation
that
mr.
hoddinott
indicated
is
now
being
dropped,
in
saying
that
there
was
in
effect
pre-emption.
how
do
you
deal
with
that,
and
how
is
this
different?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
has
the
regulation
changed
the
footnote
to
the
regulation
since
mcgoldrick
other
than
the
numbering?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
language
change
whatever
since
mcgoldrick?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
the
same
language.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
has
been
renumbered,
in
effect,
relocated.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
gulf
oil
had
withdrawn
some
of
that
oil
for
domestic
consumption
on
payment
of
duties,
just
like
xerox
could
have
done
theoretically--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
sent
out
a
paper
notice
that
this
is
the
amount
of
the
tax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
simply
didn't
try
to
enforce
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--because
there
was
an
intervening
suit
for
declaratory
judgment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
also
because
you
wouldn't
try
to
enforce
if
someone
didn't
pay
until
the
federal
government
permitted
you
to
do
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
ms.
chapman,
do
you
in
effect
agree
that
your
right
to
assess
the
tax
and
ultimately
collect
it
may
be
different
under
the
customs
act
than
your
right
to
enforce
a
lien
and
to
sell
that
property
for
defaulted
taxes
while
it
is
still
within
the
customs
warehouse?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
chapman,
you
haven't
mentioned
your
jurisdictional
arguments.
are
you
still
asserting
those?
