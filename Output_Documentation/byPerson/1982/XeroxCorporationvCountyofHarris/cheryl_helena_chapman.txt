ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
courts
the
crucial
question
for
consideration
is,
does
the
state
of
texas
have
the
power
to
tax
goods
in
customs
bonded
warehouses.
we
submit
that
the
power
to
tax
resides
in
and
is
reserved
to
the
state
of
texas
unless
congress
has
acted
to
pre-empt
the
taxation
of
goods
in
customs
bonded
warehouses.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
the
purpose
of
the
bonded
warehouse
is
to
ensure
that
the
government
will
collect
its
revenue
duties.
the
bond
is--
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
--the
federal
government.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
the
importer
posts
the
bond
as
liquidated
damages
if
it
should
fail
to
pay
customs
duties
or
if
the
imports
for
some
reason
enter
into
domestic
commerce.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
the
state
of
texas
has
no
power
under
the
constitution
to
assess
a
duty.
the
state
has
the
power
to
tax--
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
--yes.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
the
county's
position
did
not...
the
county
in
1976,
prior
to
this
court's
ruling
in
the
michelin
decision,
initially
determined
through
a
tax
agent,
initially
determined
that
those
goods
were
subject
to
tax
immunity
under
michelin...
under
low
v.
austin
doctrine
of
governmental--
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
--yes,
as
a
result
of
this
court's
holding
in
michelin,
the
county
re-examined
the
taxability
of
those
goods,
and
back
assessed
those
goods
for
the
year
1976.
xerox
admits
that
those
goods
had
been
operating
in
texas
since...
had
been
stored
in
texas
since
1974,
and
the
goods
continued
to
remain
in
texas
until
the
end
of
1977.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
xerox
removed
their
copiers
to
the
state
of
new
york
in
december
of
1977.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
we
do
not
believe
it
can
be
taxed.
those
goods
are
in
fact
in
transit,
and
are
not
here
by
any
reason
but
for
any
purposes
of
the
owner
or
the
convenience
of
the
owner.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
we
have
two,
i
believe,
one
in
galveston
and
one
somewhere
else.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
no,
we
have
re-examined
the
foreign
trade
zone
act,
and
we
do
not
know
whether
or
not
those
goods
would
be
subject
to
tax.
we
do
distinguish
the
foreign
trade
zone
act
from
the
customs
bonded
regulatory
scheme
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
taxing
jurisdiction
may
opt
for
the
presence
of
that
free
trade
zone,
foreign
trade
zone.
we
have
no...
we
had
no
choice
about
who
utilizes
the
services
of
houston,
texas,
in
storing
goods
in
customs
bonded
warehouses.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
the
purpose
of
the
free
trade
zone
is
to
ameliorate
or
to
compensate
for
the
problems
that
we're
having
now.
many
countries...
many
companies
such
as
xerox
are
taking
a
lot
of
their
businesses
outside
of
the
united
states,
producing
a
lot
of
their
goods
outside
of
the
united
states,
and
the
purpose
of
the
free
trade
zone
is
to
attract
business
back
into
the
united
states.
we
have
lost
a
considerable
amount
of
business.
assembly,
for
example,
is
taking
place
in
mexico
because
of
the
cheaper
cost
of
labor.
the
very
reason--
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
--the
concessions
are
determined
by
the
federal
government,
and
we
will...
they
are
determined
by
the
federal
government.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
no,
we
are
not.
the
legislation
does
not
prohibit
state
taxation
of
goods
in
a
free
trade
zone.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
under
the
bonded
warehouse...
under
our
customs
bonded
scheme,
manufacturers
cannot,
under
the...
the
word
is
manipulate.
cannot
affect
those
bonded
goods
in
any
ways,
except
under--
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
--and
in
a
free
trade
zone--
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
--yes.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
yes,
they
do.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
the
texas
constitution
mandates
that
all
property
be
taxed
in
a
uniform
and
equal
manner.
the
city
of
houston
is
under
that
constitutional
mandate
when
it
assesses
property.
we
cannot
make
a
decision
as
to
what
property
gets
taxed.
that
is
a
matter
for
our
state
legislature
to
decide.
we
submit
that
the
power
to
tax
resides
in
and
is
reserved
to
the
state
of
texas
unless
congress
has
acted
to
pre-empt
the
taxation
of
customs
bonded
property,
or
two,
unless
the
tax
is
prohibited
by
the
provisions
of
the
united
states
constitution,
or
three,
unless
the
tax
interferes
with
the
federal
government's
exclusive
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce
or
prevents
it
from
speaking
with
one
voice.
in
this
case,
congress
has
enacted
no
law
to
prohibit
state
taxation
of
customs
bonded
goods.
this
tax--
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
--mcgoldrick
in
our
opinion
is
an
entirely
different
case.
it
involves
an
entirely
different
regulatory
scheme.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
the
secretary--
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
--yes,
the
secretary
of
treasury
deleted
the
provision
from
the
customs
regulations
some
time
after
the
mcgoldrick
decision,
and
it
is
now
an
appendage
to
the
regulations
in
the
form
of
a
footnote.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
it's
the
same
language,
and
we--
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
--yes.
it
is
our
opinion
that
that
customs
regulation
in
the
mcgoldrick
case
amounted
to
nothing
more
than
a
restatement
of
the
law
at
that
time,
a
restatement
of
the
low
v.
austin
doctrine
that
imports
are
immune
from
state
taxation.
this
is
the
same
conclusion
that
the
court
in
american
smelting,
a
decision
out
of
california,
arrived
at.
but
the
mcgoldrick
decision
does
not
express
a
rule
of
law
for
all
property
in
all
customs
bonded
warehouses.
the
court
was
careful
to
limit
its
holding
to
the
particular
facts
before
it
and
the
particular
regulatory
scheme.
mcgoldrick
does
not
control
this
case
because
it
involved
an
entirely
different
regulatory
scheme,
and
was
affected
by
an
entirely
different
tax.
we
have
before
us
the
laws
governing
customs
bonded
warehouses,
which
is
an
intricate
part
of
the
tariff
laws.
in
mcgoldrick,
the
court
addressed
the
problems
of
a
specific
industry
and
in
that
case
the
court
had
before
it
the
revenue
act
of
1932.
congress
had
amended
that
revenue
act
for
the
reason
that
it
wanted
to
restore
to
american
fuel
oil
manufacturers
their
competitive
footing
in
foreign
markets
which
had
been
lost
when
the
original
tax
had
been
imposed
under
the
revenue
act.
congress
did
this
by
exempting
imported
oil
sold
into
foreign
commerce
from
the
revenue
tax,
and
by
the
operation
of
that
particular
regulatory
scheme,
that
tax
was
in
effect
a
duty.
it
was
imposed
on
the
importation
of
oil.
the
new
york
tax
in
the
mcgoldrick
case
in
its
practical
effect
and
as
applied
to
the
oil
that
was
in
bond
was
nothing
more
than
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
exporting
oil
out
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
tax
fell
on
the
purchaser
at
the
time
the
oil
was
being
transferred
to
the
vessels
which
were
destined,
bound
for
foreign
commerce.
by
operation
of
the
regulatory
scheme,
the
customs
regulatory
scheme
at
that
time,
the
oil...
and
that
same
scheme
exists
today...
the
oil
was
irrevocably
committed
to
the
export
stream.
the
tax
asserted
in
mcgoldrick
was
in
direct
contravention
of
congress's
expressed
intent
to
relieve
imported
oil
destined
for
foreign
commerce
from
import
duties.
moreover,
the
tax
in
mcgoldrick
constituted
a
prohibited
regulation
of
commerce.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
in
that
case,
it
could
not
have.
it
was
bound
once
it
entered
that
oil
into
the
manufacturing
warehouse
to
export
the
oil.
so
it
was
legally
unable
to
do
so,
as
is
not
the
case
here.
there
is
no
law
before
this
court
which
is
designed
to
give
xerox
or
any
copier
manufacturing
industry
a
special
competitive
advantage.
there
has
been
no
commitment
to
the
export
stream
of
commerce
here.
xerox
has
at
all
times...
had
at
all
times
full
powers
to
dispose
of
its
copiers,
and
it
in
fact
did
so
in
a
limited
instance
when
it
sold
some
copiers
to
an
agency
of
the
united
states
government.
xerox
maintains
that
its
copiers
are
designed
for
foreign
use
only.
that
they
are...
there
is
no
doubt
that
those
copiers
were
intended
for
distribution
in
foreign
markets.
however,
the
record
reflects
that
those
copiers
could
have
been
converted
for
domestic
use
by
the
additional
cost
of
$100
plus
the
payment
of
customs
duties.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
the
record
reflects...
xerox
admits
in
its
deposition,
the
deposition
of
its
witness
ricarlo
perez,
as
well
as
in
their
answers
to
interrogatories,
that
the
copiers
could
have
been
converted
for
domestic--
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
--no,
this
is
in
the...
it
is
contained
in
the
deposition
of
ricarlo
perez
and--
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
--okay.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
no.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
yes.
the
adaptability
has
no
impact
on
the
legal
issues.
our
position
is
that
as
long
as
those
goods
are
stored
in
houston
for
the
business
convenience
of
xerox,
and
there
is
no
question
about
that,
and
the
state
of
texas
has
acquired
a
taxable
situs,
then
we
are
entitled
to
tax
those
copiers.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
yes,
and
this
court
has
addressed
that
issue
in
the
case
of
kosydar
versus...
national
cash
register
versus
kosydar,
where
the
goods
were
only
designed
for
foreign
use.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
yes,
it
is.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
and
that
was
the
original
purpose
of
the
customs
bonded
warehousing
scheme.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
no.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
that's
correct.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
that's
correct,
and
that
is
the
likely
result
if
xerox
obtains
immunity
under
the
customs
bond
theory.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
absolutely
not.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
no,
we
do
not,
and
this
particular
regulatory...
the
laws
governing
goods
detained
under
revenue
laws
prevent
us
from
affecting
the
federal
government's
rights
to
customs
duties.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
in
a--
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
--that's
correct.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
we
would
have
a
lien,
as
does
the
warehouseman
have
a
lien,
as
does
the
carrier
have
a
lien.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
if
that
property
had
acquired
a
taxable
situs
under
the...
if
they
had
been
there
under
the
same
circumstances,
yes,
as
xerox.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
well,
those
are
not...
the
facts
of
this
case,
xerox
at
all
times
had
maintained
an
average
inventory
on
a
daily
basis
of
over
4,000
copiers,
which
we
did
assess.
we
believe
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
brown
versus
houston,
that
once
property
is
put
on
the
market
for
sale,
it
has
been...
it
has
become
a
part
of
a
general
mass
of
property
and
is
subject
to
state
taxation.
we
also
believe
that
the
complete
auto
transit
case,
the
test
enunciated
in
that
would
permit
a
tax
in
those
circumstances.
we
don't
know,
and
we
haven't
considered...
we...
our
state
would
not...
our
state
presently
has
a
provision
that
would
require
that
the
property
be
stored
for
175
days
before
the
presumption...
before
there
is
a
presumption
that
they
are
not
in
interstate
commerce.
however,
without
that
statutory
provision,
we
would
require
that
the
property
be
here
indefinitely.
ms.

for

taxing
jurisdictions,
including
for
the
state
of
texas.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
yes.
the
regulatory
scheme
involved
here
are
the
laws
governing
customs
bonded
warehouses,
title
19
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1555,
1556,
and
1557.
these
statutes
and
authorized
regulations
operate
to
defer
import
duties.
they
serve
merely
as
a
convenience
to
the
importer
by
relieving
the
importer
of
immediate
cash
payment
of
customs
duties.
congress
under
these
provisions
has
enacted
no
law
to
exempt
state
taxation
of
goods
in
bonded
warehouses,
nor
can
the
intent
be
inferred
from
this
particular
legislative
scheme
without
an
explicit
declaration
by
congress.
it
cannot...
we
cannot
infer
that
congress
intended
to
give
these
copiers...
these
imports
a
discriminatory
tax
advantage
against
domestic
commerce.
these
copiers
were
not
in
transit
on
tax
day.
as
we
know
from
michelin,
no...
a
non-discriminatory
tax
on
imports
not
in
transit
is
not
prohibited.
these
goods
were
on
the
market
for
sale.
they
had
come
to
rest
within
the
jurisdiction,
and
by
all
applicable
traditional
principles,
these
goods
are
subject
to
state
and
local
taxation.
to
avoid...
xerox
cannot
avoid
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
these
copiers
have
acquired
a
situs
in
texas.
by
the
use
or
the
employment
of
a
fiction,
xerox
argues
that
its
goods
are
not
in
the
state
of
texas,
but
in
a
state
of
transiency.
it
has
provided
this
court
with
no
authority
for
that
proposition.
the...
cases
that
xerox
has
cited
involve
straight
regulatory
powers.
the...
cases
cited
by
xerox
involve
construction
of
a
tariff...
they
involve
neither
state
regulatory
powers
nor
state
taxing
powers.
to
the
contrary,
where
courts
have
examined
the
right
of
the
state
to
tax
goods
in
customs
bonded
warehouses,
they
have
determined
that
customs
bonded
status
in
and
of
itself
does
not
confer
in
transit
immunity.
the
court
held
this
in
state
versus
hopper
out
of
texas,
american
smelting,
and
in
the
trace
retailers
ranch
case
out
of
new
mexico.
even
in
the
national
distillers
case,
which
xerox
relies
so
heavily
on,
the
court
expressly
rejected
the
argument
that
bonded
storage
conferred
in
transit
immunity.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
we
have
raised
those
points
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
we
have
nothing
new
to
add.
we
think
that
if
the
court
decides
to
assume
cert,
that
these...
the
same
issues
are
going
to
be
controlling.
we
think
the
tax
is
neither
prohibitive
under
the
import
export
clause
nor
the
commerce
clause,
and
the
tax
does
not
interfere
with
domestic...
with
flow
in
commerce.
there
is
no...
unlike
japan
lines,
there
are
no
treaties
involved
in
this
case,
no
conventions
or
trade
agreements.
there
is
no
genuine
conflict
of
law
problem
as
existed
in
japan
lines,
which
resulted
in
a
multiple
taxation
of
property
on
an
international
level.
we
know
of
no
rule
of
law
which
would
permit
another
sovereignty
to
tax
property...
to
tax
xerox's
copiers,
impose
a
property
tax
on
xerox's
copiers
while
under
the
exclusive
protection
of
the
state
of
texas.
the
tax
has
no
effect
on
the
government's
need
to
speak
with
one
voice,
which
is
an
import
export
concern,
and
speaking
with
one
voice
under
the
import
export
clause
is
assured
when
the
federal
government
and
the
federal
government
alone
imposes
customs
duties.
xerox
is
well
aware
of
the
benefits,
and
can
well
appreciate
the
benefits
provided
by
the
state
of
texas.
the
reason
that
xerox
removed
its
distribution
operation
from
panama
to
houston
was
that
riot-threatened
panama
could
no
longer
protect
its
copiers.
we
submit
that
since
congress
has
enacted
no
law,
and
with
regard
to
footnote
11,
footnote
11
fails
for
the
reason
that
the
secretary
of
treasury
has
no
power,
the
secretary
of
treasury
has
no
power
to
regulate...
to
legislate,
excuse
me,
the
limits
of
state
taxing
powers.
only
congress
has
that
power,
and
congress
has
not
addressed
this
issue,
and
congress
has
not
spoken
in
this
case.
ms.
cheryl
helena
chapman
all
right.
thank
you.
