we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
xerox
corporation
against
harris
county,
texas,
and
houston.
mr.
hoddinott,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
were
there
instructions...
printed
instructions
with
these
things,
as
there
are
so
often,
that
accompanied
the
machine?
yes
your
honor.
and
they
were
in--
they
were
in
spanish
and
portuguese.
and
the
copiers
also
were
electrically
different
than
copiers
that
are
manufactured
from
the
united
states.
how
about
the
symbols?
are
there
any
difference
in
the
symbols
on
the
board
or
are
the
letters
the
same?
since
xerox
copiers
generally
use
little
figures
of
people,
i
would
imagine
that
they
would
be
the
same,
but
the
descriptions
in
the
manuals
would
all
different.
it
is
conceded,
your
honor,
that
these
copiers
were
always
segregated
from
domestic
goods
and
they
were
always
in
the
complete
custody
and
control
of
the
u.s.
customs
service.
we
contend
they
were
therefore
always
in
foreign
commerce.
parenthetically,
the
appellees
paid
approximately
$2
million
on
copiers
that
were
sold
domestically.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
in
terms
of
the
local
protection,
the
local
tax
problem
that
justice
rehnquist
referred
to,
that
all
of
that
cost
of
protection,
fire
and
police
and
others,
are
reflected
in
the
rent
that
you're
paying
and
is
passed
on
to
xerox?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
your
point
of
view,
i
take
your
argument
to
be
that
this
is
just
legally
and
constitutionally
the
same
as
though
these
machines
were
in
a
big
cargo
airplane
and
happened
to
fly
over
the
lower
part
of
florida.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
it
wouldn't
have
much
contact
with
the
continental
united
states,
but
in
an
airplane
they
would
at
least
have
some
semblance
of
contact
by
flying
over
key
west.

ms.
chapman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
that
is
so,
ms.
chapman,
then
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
bonded
warehouse
in
relation
to
the
operation
of
the
customs
service?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
federal
government.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
federal
government
will.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
texas
have
levied
a
duty,
assessed
a
duty
on
this
property
when
it
came
in
from
mexico?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say
if
these
copiers
had
been
taken
on
board
ships
out
of
some
eastern
port
of
mexico,
placed
on
the
ships,
destined
for
either
this
enclave
in
new
york
or
for
argentina,
but
stopped
for
repairs
or
fuel
in
one
of
the
texas
ports?
while
it
was
in
the
texas
port,
could
it
be
taxed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
free
trade
zone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
suppose
you
had
automobiles
manufactured
in
the
same
setting
as
this,
destined
for
england
or
sweden
or
some
other
country
where
they
have
the
right-hand
drive.
they
could
be
sold
in
the
united
states,
too,
because
a
great
many
people,
or
at
least
some
people
use
a
right-hand
drive
car
in
this
country,
but
because
it
was
adaptable,
if
they
had
been
in
bonded
warehouses,
would
that
adaptability
have
any
impact
on
the
legal
issues
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
would
be
independent
of
whether
they
could
be
modified
for
domestic
use
or
not,
in
your
view.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
have
any
other
consequence
than
deferring
the
payment
of
the
duty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
it
enters
the
country,
instead
of
paying
the
duty
immediately
on
entry
if
it
goes
into
a
bonded
warehouse,
the
duty
is
deferred
until
it
is
taken
out
of
the
bonded
warehouse
for
sale
in
the
united
states.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
xerox
is
pretty
much
everywhere.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
hoddinott?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
you
can
use
it
just
the
way
it
is.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
the
automobile.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
