justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
what
is
the
distinction
between
the
numbers?
i
notice
in
these
cases
they
speak
of
number
3,
number
7,
and
this
kind
of
thing.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
didn't
xerox
store
this
property
in
mexico?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
it
is
in
any
way
related
to
the
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
i
take
it
we
have
only
one
year's
taxes
involved
here,
do
we
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
two.
and
they
have
driven
the
xerox
out
of
texas.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
still
using
buffalo,
new
york?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
ms.
chapman,
somewhere
would
you
touch
upon
the
issuance
of
the
exemption
letter
by
the
county?
i
realize
you
represent
the
city,
but
in
a
sense
you
are
representing
both
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
somewhere,
would
you
touch
on
that?
why
it
was
issued,
and
why
now
the
county's
position
has
so
drastically
changed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
have
a
free
trade
enclave
in
texas?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
your
brief
concedes
that
if
these
goods
had
been
in
such
an
enclave,
that
they
would
not
be
taxable.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
see.
i
get
from
your
remarks
with
the
free
trade
zones
you
are
hoping
to
attract
business
to
texas,
and
yet
i
suppose
the
imposition
of
your
tax
here
has
driven
business
away.
the
goods
are
now
out
of
texas.
they
went
to
new
york,
and
your
opposition
said
he
didn't
know
whether
they
were
still
there
or
not.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
meeting
yourself
coming
back.
you
are
not
entirely
consistent
in
that
respect.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--you
say
the
record
is
what?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
will
be
interested
in
what
your
opponent
says
about
that,
because
as
i
read
the
briefs,
i
thought
there
was
a
flat
dispute
on
this
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
he
can
answer.
don't
waste
any
time
on
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
in
any
event,
none
were
converted.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
have
other
property
in
the
state.
