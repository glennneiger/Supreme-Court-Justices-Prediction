mr.
smith,
isn't
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
quite
consistent
with
the
intimation
in
the
crane
footnote?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
agree
with
you,
but
how
much
practice
and
usage
among
the
tax
bar
and
the
courts
that
decide
tax
cases,
more
often
than
we,
has
grown
up
in
reliance
on
the
idea
that
what
you
have
described
as
"a
dictum"
is
at
least--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
you
are
at
the
level
we
understand.
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
they
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
debt
anymore,
they
never
did
have
to
worry
about
it.
