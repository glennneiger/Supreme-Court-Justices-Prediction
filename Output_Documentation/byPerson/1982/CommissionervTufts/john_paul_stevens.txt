justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
your
position
as
applied
to
crane
itself?
supposing
on
the
facts
of
crane,
where
you
have
inherited
property,
the
property
had
been
disposed
of
at
a
time
when
its
fair-market
value
was
below
the
amount
of
indebtedness.
you
would
still
say
there
that
the
heir
would
have
a
full
gain
as
to
the
extent
of
the
indebtedness?
the
measure...
you
would
apply
it,
crane
itself,
you
would
say,
would
have
been
decided
the
same
way
if
the
property--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
fact,
about
half
the
opinion
couldn't
have
been
written.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
loaves-and-fishes
argument
is
not
very
persuasive
when
you
have
inherited
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
someone
inherits
property
and
inherits
no
obligation,
but
the
property
is
encumbered,
and
then
they
dispose
of
it
by
just
abandoning
it.
they
suddenly
realize
a
gain
in
the
amount
of
the
encumbrance,
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
under
your
view
the
basis
for
the
transferee...
in
this
case,
bayles...
is
limited
by
the
fair-market
value,
so
his
basis
is
different
from
the
amount
realized--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
fair-market
value
puts
a
ceiling
on
it,
then
it
puts
a
ceiling
on
at
both
ends
of
the
transaction;
if
the
amount
of
the
indebtedness
is
the
major
basis,
it
is
at
both
ends
of
the
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
going
back
to
my
crane
question
earlier,
if
the
value
of
the
property
at
the
time
of
the
death
of
the
person
from
whom
it
was
inherited,
had
a
fair-market
value
of
less
than
the
indebtedness,
that
would
have
been
her
basis
at
the
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
like
to
waggle
it
at
you,
too,
because--
[laughter]
--it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
statute,
you
just
read
the
words,
the
definition
of
"amount
realized"
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
how
can
it
have
one
meaning
in
the
loss
situation
and
a
different
meaning
when
you're
looking
at
the
amount
realized
that's
claimed
to
be
a
gain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
if
it's
a
matter
of
legislative
grace,
and
maybe
you
don't
want
it
in
this
case
but
the
next
taxpayer
comes
along
and
says,
well,
if
these
words
mean
what
the
fifth
circuit
said
they
mean
in
this
case,
we're
entitled
to
take
the
loss.
and
why
wouldn't
that
be
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
in
the
statute
requires
an
economic
detriment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
we
have
a
transaction
similar
to
this,
but
before
the
owner
of
the
property
disposed
of
it,
they
realized
the
fair-market
value
declined
from
$1.8
million
to
$1.4
million,
and
the
owner
went
to
the
bank
and
said,
we
can't
carry
the
$1.8
million
loan,
would
you
reduce
the
indebtedness
to
a
more
realistic
figure?
and
they
agreed
to
reduce
the
indebtedness,
say,
to
$1.5
million.
then
he
continued
to
own
it
for
a
while.
but
he
never
is
on
the
note.
would
he
realize
any
tax...
would
there
be
any
taxable
consequences
in
changing
the
principle
amount
of
the
note
when
it's
a
nonrecourse
note?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
suppose
if
they
did
that,
and
then
after
owning
it
for
2
or
3
years,
and
then
after
another
year
or
so
then
he
disposed
of
it,
as
he
did
in
this
case,
fair-market
value
at
$1.5
million.
you
would
still
say...
in
that
case,
what
would
be
the
tax--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
we
have
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
even
though
the
liability
was
reduced
in
amount,
that
that
still
didn't
result
in
any
taxable
benefit
of
any
kind
to
the
owner
of
the
property
who
was
not
on
the
note?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
smith,
why
couldn't...
i
mean
your
opponent
says
that
in
crane
the
court
read
something
into
the
statute
that
wasn't
perfectly
clear
that
was
there,
why
couldn't
the
court,
in
effect,
say,
well,
looking
at
the
code
as
a
whole,
a
loss
is
not
recognized
unless
there's
an
economic
detriment.
that
is,
i
understand,
his
bottom
line.
why
couldn't
we
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no;
a
loss
is
not
recognized.
you're
saying
there
would
be
a
loss
if
the
fair-market
value
went
down
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
i
mean
would
it
be
inconsistent
with
the
way
the
court
has
construed
the
code
in
the
past?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
he
right
in
saying
there
are
no
cases
in
which
a
loss
has
been
recognized
for
tax
purposes
without
an
economic
detriment?
