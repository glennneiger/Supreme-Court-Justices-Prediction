justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
quite
fair,
because
he
owed
the
bill
for
the
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
everybody
agrees,
everybody
agrees
you
realize
an
amount
if
you
have
one
of
your
obligations
assumed.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
you're
just
bootstrapping.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
the
crane
principle
just
covers
this
case
like
a
blanket
even
though
it
was
reserved.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
bound
to
get
around
to
saying,
why
is...
why
did
this
seller
here,
why
did
this
seller
realize
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
he
realize?
you've
got
to
say
what,
determine
what
amount
he
realized.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
he
realized
something
when
he
took
the
deduction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
want
to
get
it
back,
anyway.
you
want
to
get
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you're
going
to
pay
gain
on
the
deduction.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
say
somebody,
by
the
depreciation
of
the
property
somebody
has
suffered
a
loss,
but
is
it
the
taxpayer
if
he
hasn't
suffered
any
economic
harm?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
probably
the
bank.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
isn't
the
taxpayer's
loss?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
the
chief
justice's
example,
though,
when
you're
making
up
your
statement
to
the
bank
after
you
purchase
the
property
and
build
the
building
and
complete
the
loan
and
you
close
it...
but
this
is
before
the
sale--
justice
byron
r.
white
--before
you
sell.
how
do
you
enter
it
on
your
balance
sheet?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
doesn't
owe
the
liability.
the
property
is
subject
to
it.
so
it
reduces
his
asset.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
am
asking
you.
what
do
you
think
the
accounting--
justice
byron
r.
white
--your
tax
accountant
knows.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
his
income
from
the
property,
though,
the
rental
income
from
the
property,
just
paid
the...
was
such
that
it
didn't
earn
any
income
but
he
had
a
cash
flow
equal,
net
cash
flow
that
he
could
put
in
his
pocket
equal
to
the
depreciation.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
he
would
have
cash
then
that
he
didn't
have
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
so
that...
so
he
would
walk
away
from
the
transaction
with
the...
with
money
equal
to
the
amount
of
the
deductions.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
he'd
have
that
much--
justice
byron
r.
white
--more
money
afterwards
than
he
had
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but...
i
know,
but
that's
the
very
amount
of
money
that
they
would
like
to
tax
on.
