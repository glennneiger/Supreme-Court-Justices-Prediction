--why
do
you
think
footnote

is
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
professor
would
give
you
more
than
you
asked
for.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
about
crane.
and
that
is,
that...
so
i
am
sure
that
i
know
your
position...
do
you
feel
that
this
case
can
be
affirmed
without
overruling
crane?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
leaving
footnote
37
aside,
i
take
it
then
that
it
is
your
position
that
crane
controls
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
is
it
fair
to
say
has
your
position
been
consistent
on
that
all
the
way
through?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
your
position
has
not
been
consistent
all
the
way
through?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
also
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
case
does
not
readily
lend
itself
to
announcement
from
the
bench
that
suffice
as
i
think
to
say
that
it
is
an
income
tax
case
concerning
section
752(d)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
in
partnership
interests
and
a
nonrecourse
mortgage
loan.
and
it
also
focuses
on
a
1947
decision
by
this
court
called
crane
against
commissioner.
the
united
states
tax
court
upheld
deficiencies
asserted
by
the
commissioner
against
the
respondents
and
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
expressly
disagreeing
with
an
earlier
third
circuit
decision.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
for
we
find
the
commissioner's
interpretation
of
the
facts
to
be
consistent
with
the
crane
case
and
is
implementing
the
statutory
mandate
in
a
reasonable
manner.
justice
o'connor
while
joining
the
opinion
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
