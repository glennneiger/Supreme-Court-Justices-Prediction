the
court
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
against
tufts.
mr.
smith,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mankoff.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
put
this
hypothetical
to
you.
first,
i
would
assume
you
would
agree
that
it
would
make
no
difference
if
this
were
a
partnership
or
an
individual.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
for--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--to
simplify
the
hypothetical,
it's
an
individual,
and
the
transaction
is
exactly
the
same.
now,
the
taxpayer
is
making
up
a
statement
for
his
bank
before
this
transaction
occurred;
that
is,
after
he
had
acquired
the
property
but
before
disclosing.
and
then
assume
after
the
transaction
is
completed,
he
makes
up
the
financial
statement
for
the
bank
for
other
purposes.
can
you
suggest
how
the
transaction
would
be
treated
in
terms
of
assets
and
liabilities
in
his
financial
statement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
the
first
place--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--in
the
first
place,
he
wouldn't
list
this
liability--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--as
a
liability
on
his
first
statement
because
it
was
nonrecourse.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
after
the
transaction
is
completed,
would
you
make
that
comparison
for
me?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure,
mr.
mankoff,
whether
you
had
completed
your
response
to
my
hypothetical
or
whether
you
did
complete
it
and
i
didn't
follow
you.
what's
the
difference
in
these
two
statements
in
terms
of
the
net
worth
of
this
individual
in
the
hypothetical
before
and
after?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you're
making
a
statement
form,
how
would
you
make
it
up?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
first
statement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he's
neither
richer
nor
poorer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
on
the
first
statement,
he
has
no
personal
liability
for
the
obligation,
does
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
smith?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
against
tufts
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
blackmun.
