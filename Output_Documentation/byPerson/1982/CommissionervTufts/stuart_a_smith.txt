mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
federal
income
tax
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
presents
an
important
question
dealing
with
the
tax
consequences
of
the
disposition
of
property
subject
to
a
mortgage.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
allowed
a
loss,
based
upon
a
cost
that
respondents
did
not
incur
and
turned
out
never
would
incur,
and
thereby
reached
a
result
that
we
believe
to
be
totally
at
odds
with
the
economic
reality
of
the
transaction.
the
facts
are
relatively
simple
and
can
be
summarized
as
follows:
in
1970
respondents
formed
a
general
partnership
for
the
construction
of
an
apartment
project
in
duncanville,
texas.
they
obtained
a
nonrecourse
mortgage
loan
of
$1.85
million.
by
"nonrecourse",
that
meant
that
none
of
the
borrowers
on
the
note
bore
any
personal
liability
for
the
loan
but
that
the
lender
bank
could
look
only
to
the
security
of
the
property
secured
by
the
mortgage.
in
1971
and
1972
the
partners,
of
which
mr.
tufts
was
one,
contributed
approximately
$40,000
in
cash
to
the
general
partnership.
and
they
included
under
the
applicable
tax
rules,
which
the
parties
stipulate
to
be
correct,
a
proportionate
share
of
their
$1.85
million
debt
in
each
of
their
bases
of
their
partnership
interests.
in
1970
through
1972,
when
the
partners
held
the
project,
they
claimed
approximately
$440,000
of
the
tax
deductions
which
represented
depreciation
and
other
losses
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
the
apartment
project.
those
deductions
were
entirely
proper
and
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
in
august
1972
the
partners
disposed
of
the
property
subject
to
the
mortgage
to
an
unrelated
third
party.
at
the
time
of
this
disposition
there
never
had
been
any
amortization
of
the
principle
balance
on
the
mortgage
debt.
that
mortgage
debt
remained
throughout
the
entire
period
of
their
ownership
at
$1.85
million.
and
at
the
time
of
disposition,
the
basis
of
the
taxpayers'
partnership
interests
had
been
reduced
because
of
depreciation
to
$1.45
million.
now,
this
transaction
came
under
audit
by
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
and
he
determined
that
respondents
had
realized
gain
of
approximately
$400,000
as
a
result
of
the
disposition
of
the
property.
the
computation
of
gain
was
by
reference
to
the
amount
realized
by
the
respondents
in
this
case,
the
$1.85
million
loan,
which
the
unrelated
party
picked
up
on
the
transfer
of
the
property
subject
to
the
mortgage
minus
their
bases
of
$1.45
million,
which
yields
approximately
$400,000
in
gain.
this
case
came
to
the
tax
court
on
respondent's
petition
for
review,
and
the
tax
court
upheld
the
commissioner's
determination
and,
in
so
doing,
followed
a
uniform
line
of
authority
above
the
tax
court
and
of
the
other
appellate
courts.
and
in
a
situation
like
this,
a
disposition
of
property
subject
to
a
mortgage
requires
that
when
the
mortgage
has
never
been
amortized
down
at
all,
that
the
amount
realized
on
the
disposition
of
property
include
the
unpaid
mortgage
balance.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
in
this
case
reversed.
it
limited
the
amount
realized
to
the
value
of
the
property
that
happened
to
be
at
the
time
of
disposition,
which
was
$1.4
million.
and
it
did
so
despite
the
fact
that
the
property
was
transferred
subject
to
a
debt
well
in
excess
of
this
amount;
that
is,
$1.85
million.
but
the
value
of
the
property,
we
submit,
has
absolutely
no
significance
to
the
tax
consequences
of
such
a
transaction.
as
i
shall
develop,
once
the
taxpayer's
determined
to
transfer
the
property
along
with
the
debt,
the
value
of
the
property
is
only
relevant
to
the
new
owner
and
the
lender
who
must
look
to
that
value
of
the
property
for
satisfaction
of
his
loan.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
we
don't...
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
don't
think
it
is
consistent
with
the
intimation
in
the
crane
footnote,
as
i
shall
point
out
in
greater
detail.
all
we
think
that
crane
footnote
did
was
to,
by
way
of
dictum,
express
a
reservation
that
they
weren't
dealing
with
the
facts
of
the
case
that
is
now
before
the
court.
i
don't
think
that
the
intimation
in
that
footnote
is
necessarily
tantamount
to
a
rule
of
law
that
when
the
value
of
the
property--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely
not.
the
practice
and
usage
is
directly
to
the
contrary.
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
tax
bar,
both
public
and
private,
has
always
regarded
that
footnote,
as
i
shall
point
out
in
greater
detail,
as
simply
a
response
to
the
economic
benefit
analysis
that
the
court
engaged
in,
in
part,
in
crane.
but
we
submit,
and
the
courts
of
appeals,
apart
from
the
court
below
as
well
as
the
tax
court,
has
consistently
held
both
before
crane
and
since
crane
that
the
fundamental
aspect
of
the
crane
principle
is
the
relationship,
the
functional
relationship,
between
basis
and
amount
realized.
and
basically,
our
submission
here
is
that
since
that
basis
is
cost
and
it
requires...
that
implies
an
economic
outlay.
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
respondents
borrowed
$1.85
million
on
a
nonrecourse
basis.
crane,
the
principle
of
crane
allows
you
to
include
that
loan
balance
in
basis
for
purposes
of
depreciation
or
any
other
purpose,
purposes
of
computing
gain
on
ultimate
disposition.
but
the
quid
pro
quo
of
including
that
in
basis
is
that
at
the
other
end
of
the
transaction,
that
mortgage
balance
has
never
been
paid,
you
have
to
account
for
it
at
the
other
end
of
the
transaction.
in
other
words,
the
notion
is
that
basis
is
economic
outlay;
that
is,
cost.
and
while
we
permit
someone
to
borrow
money
and
count
it
as
basis,
if
they
never
pay
any
of
that
money,
there
has
to
be
a
reconciliation
of
the
accounts
at
the
other
end.
the
footnote
in
crane
didn't
dispute
what
we
think
is
the
logic
of
that.
and
in
fact,
the
crane
decision,
the
rationale
of
the
crane
decision,
we
submit;
that
is,
putting,
establishing
a
functional
relationship
between
basis
and
amount
realized
requires
that
there
be
this
reconciliation
of
accounts
at
the
disposition
of
property
the
way
it
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
footnote...
there
has
been
a
lot
of
ink
spilled
on
this,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
and
i
could
only
perhaps
summarize
it,
you
know,
in
a
few
sentences.
i
suspect
that
the
reason
footnote
37
is
there,
i
mean
i
think
what
happened
in
crane
is
that
the
court
engaged,
in
part,
in
what
the
commentaries
refer
to
as
an
"economic
benefit
analysis".
and
they,
one
of
the
things
that
the
chief
justice
wrote
was
that,
well,
that
mrs.
crane
got
some
kind
of
economic
benefit.
and
in
so
doing
that,
what
the
court,
in
order
to
arrive
at
that
result,
the
court
had
to
equate
her
nonrecourse
mortgage
with
some
sort
of
recourse
liability.
and
it
was
able
to
do
this
because
she
conceded
in
the
case
that
if
the
amount
had
been
recourse,
if
the
liability
had
been
recourse,
of
course
she
would
have
been
required
to
take
it
into
account.
but
she
strenuously
urged
that
the
nonrecourse
aspect
of
the
debt
made
the
case
different.
well,
what
the
court
said
was,
well,
that
wasn't
really
true
in
this
particular
case
because
the
value
of
the
property
exceeded
the
mortgage
balance.
so
in
a
situation
like
that,
the
court
equated
recourse
and
nonrecourse
debt.
and
then
because
of
this
aspect
of
the
analysis,
the
court
wanted
to
indicate
that
perhaps
that
wouldn't
be
the
case,
that
aspect
of
the
analysis
wouldn't
apply
if
the
numbers
were
reversed.
but
i
think
that
everyone
since
that
time
has
indicated
that
the
economic
benefit
analysis
of
crane
is
really
not
the
heart
of
crane,
and
it's
not...
the
crane
principle
stands
on
the
logical
bedrock
of
a
relationship
between
basis
and
amount
realized,
and
that
if
the
code
permits
you
to
be
deemed
to
have
made
an
economic
outlay
and
you
get
basis
for
this
outlay
even
though
you
borrowed
funds
and
you
haven't
actually
put
a
dime
out
of
your
pocket,
but
implicit
in
that
notion
is
that
you
will
ultimately
pay
some
money
and
if
you
don't
ultimately
pay
some
money
the
way
respondents
did
in
this
case,
well,
then...
then
there
has
to
be
a
reconciliation.
and
in
fact,
in
thinking
about
this
case,
it
seemed
to
me,
if
you
sort
of
strip
it
of
all
its
essentials,
what
it
really
boils
down
to
is
suppose
one
were
to
buy
a
suit
from
a
department
store
and
charge
it,
the
$200,
and
then
you
wear
it
a
couple
of
times--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--and
it
doesn't
fit
you
anymore;
perhaps
the
excesses
of
the
holiday
season.
but
you
have
a
brother-in-law
who's
actually
much
slimmer
and
he
likes
the
suit.
and
you
say,
well,
i
haven't
paid
the
bill
yet,
and
he
says,
give
me
the
bill
and
i'll
pay
it
and
i'll
take
the
suit
off
your
hands.
at
that
time
the
suit
is
worth
$100
because
it's
not
a
new
suit
anymore.
well,
under
the
court
of
appeals
rationale,
which
limits
amount
realized
to
value,
you
would
have
$100
loss,
putting
aside
the
question
as
to
whether
you
could
deduct--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--sure.
but
under
our
system,
under
our
system
recourse,
since--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
but,
mr.
justice
white,
under
our
system,
since
crane,
we
have
been
equating
recourse
and
nonrecourse
liabilities.
the
example
is
not
exact,
but
i
think
what--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--no.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
am
suggesting,
and
i
think
that
the
decisional
laws,
apart
from
the
decision
in
this
case,
is
uniformly
to
the
effect
that
really
the
reservation
in
the
case
only
dealt
with
the
economic
benefit
aspect
of
the
analysis.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
he--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--right.
we
say
he
realized
$1.8
million.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he
realized
$1.8
million
because
he
borrowed
$1.8
million,
the
code
gave
him
basis
for
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
at
the
other
end
of
the
transaction,
he
had
not
amortized
that
debt,
he
had
not
paid
out
one
bit,
and
somebody
else
is
going
to
pay
that
debt.
the
property
goes
along
with
the
debt.
and
at
that
point
the
tax
law
has
to
say,
well,
how
do
we
reconcile
these
accounts?
we've
been
assuming,
we've
given
you
basis
during
the
stewardship
of
your
ownership
on
the
assumption
that
you
were
going
to
pay
out
something.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
don't
think
i
am
really
saying
that
because--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
we
don't
want
to
get
the
deductions
back.
in
fact--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
i
think
the
response
to
that
is
that
the
numbers
here
are
fairly
comparable,
given
the
fact
that
the
property
is
practically
100
percent
financed,
and
the
debt
has
not
been
amortized
one
penny.
in
a
situation
like
that,
of
course
there's
going
to
be
a
rough
comparability
between
the
deductions
taken,
which
represent,
quote,
a
recovery
of
capital,
so
to
speak,
and--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--it'd
be
exactly
the
same.
it'd
be
exactly
the
same.
and
in
fact--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--there
would...
well,
i
suppose
if
there
were
no
deduction,
if
there
were
no
deductions
taken,
there
would
be
no...
then
in
that
case,
the
taxpayers'
partnership
bases
would
be
$1.85
million.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but...
and
his
amount
realized
would
be
$1.85
million,
in
which
case
there
would
be
gain
or
loss.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
we
don't
think...
in
effect,
in
a
rough
way.
but
let
me
emphasize
the
fact
that
we're
not
recapturing
deductions.
and
i
think
that
the
best
way
to
illustrate
this
is
by
assuming
that
there
were
no...
that
there
were
no
deductions
and
that,
for
example,
let's
assume
that
the
property
in
this
case
was
nondepreciable.
suppose
the
property
was
just
a
parcel
of
raw
land,
which
they
got
a
$1.85
million
nonrecourse
note.
we
set
this
out
in
our
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief
as
well.
the
property
then
declines
to
$1.4
million,
as
occurred
in
this
case.
the
partners
then
can't
make
a
go
of
it.
they
transfer
the
property
subject
to
a
mortgage.
under
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
quarrel
about
that,
they,
the
respondents
would
have
a
$400,000
loss
because
their
basis
would
be
1.85
and
their
amount
realized
would
be
1.4.
now,
it
is
absolutely
bizarre,
to
say
the
least,
how
people
in
a
situation
like
that
could
have
a
$400,000
loss.
they
haven't
expended
a
single
penny.
and
in
fact,
in
this
particular
case,
the
error
of
the
court
below,
it
seems
to
us,
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave
the
respondents
an
extra
$50,000
of
loss;
that
is,
equal
to
the
difference
between
their
$1.45
million
basis
and
the
$1.4
million
fair-market
value.
this
is
the
modern
equivalent
of
the
miracle
of
the
loaves
and
the
fishes.
how
can
there
be
a
loss
here?
and
in
fact,
the
respondents
no
longer
have
the
temerity
even
to
claim
that
loss,
although
they
did
claim
it
in
the
courts
below,
and
their
support
of
the
decision
below
necessarily
supports
the
rationale
that
upholds
such
a
loss.
in
our
view,
this
is
an
aberration
that
doesn't
fit
with
crane
and
doesn't
really
fit
with
any...
anything
logical
that
one
can
imagine
the
code
to
allow.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
would
solve
the
problem
to
an
extent,
justice
o'connor,
but
our
response
to
that
simply
is
that
over
the
last
45
years,
property
transferred
with
liabilities
has
always...
has
always
been
considered
by...
by
the
treasury
to
be
transfers
of
the
property
along
with
the
liability.
you
don't
bifurcate
these
things
in
that
way.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
it
would--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
think
it
would
be
a
radical
transformation.
it
would...
it
would...
i
think
it
would
be
contrary
to...
to
all
the
assumptions
that
have
proceeded
from
this
court's
crane
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
that's
why--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--one
can
read
the
statute
the
way
the
amicus
reads
the
statute.
however,
the
treasury
has
for
the
last
50
years
read
the
statute
to
impose
capital
gains
in
a
situation
like
this
one.
and
we
feel
that
treasury's
reading
of
the
statute
is
a
permissible
one,
and
given
the
fact,
the
deference
that
the...
such
administrative
constructions
are
given
to...
by
the
courts
in
general
and
by
this
court,
we
feel
that
the
proper
result
here
is
the
imposition
of
capital
gains
on
the
$400,000.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
uh-huh.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
it
would
still
be
1.8.
essentially,
and
in
fact,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
income
there...
i
mean,
you
know,
there's
obviously
gain
in
the
situation
like
that
when
you
discharge
a
$1.8
million
liability
with
a
$1.4
million
piece
of
property.
our
view
is
that
that's--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
but
you
know,
it's
part
and
parcel
of...
i
mean
i
think
the
commissioner
would
take
the
position
that
since
the
liability
secured
the
debt,
it's
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
thing,
without
meaning
to
make
a
pun,
and
that
that
would
still
be...
i
mean
there's
obviously,
in
your
example,
still
gain.
the
amicus
would
take
the
position
that
it
was
gain
from
cancellation
of
indebtedness,
it
would
be
ordinary
income.
but
the
important
thing,
it
seems
to
us,
the
significance
that
i
draw
from
the
amicus
presentation
is
that
we
both
agree
that
there's
gain
in
the
transaction
like
this.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
consistent
administrative
position
as
to
the
kind
of
gain
it
is,
from
crane
and
from
all
the
cases
like
millar,
have
always
been
capital
gain
and
not
ordinary
income.
i
cannot...
i
cannot
say
that
there
cannot
be
a
situation
where
the
transaction,
the
two
transactions,
the
liability
aspect
of
the
transaction
and
the
asset
aspect
of
the
transaction,
might
be
so
separate
and
unrelated
that
there
might
be
a
determination
of
ordinary
income.
but
this
case
before
the
court
is
not
such
a
case.
the
commissioner's
determination
of
capital
gain
we
think
is
correct.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
professor
would
give
us
more
than
we
asked
for;
that
is
true.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
we
think
that
it's...
we
think
that
the--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--that
the
rationale
and
teaching
of
crane
controls
this
case,
and
that
the
court
of
appeals...
in
fact,
if
there
need
be
any
evidence
of
that,
it's
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
denied,
explicitly
denied,
a
connection
between
basis
and
amount
realized.
i
think
it's
on
page...
page
35a,
note
9
of
the
appendix.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
there
is
simply
no
relationship
between
basis,
adjustments
to
basis,
and
amount
realized.
and
crane
establishes
a
functional
relationship.
i
cannot
see
any
more
disparate
view,
you
know,
views,
more
contrary
views.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
logic
of
the
decision
below
cannot
be
squared
with
what
crane
held,
and
what
it
seems
to
us
that
all
responsible
practitioners
both
of
the
public
and
private
tax
law
have
assumed
that
crane
has
held.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
and
i
think
then
they
would
have
had
to
have
faced
up.
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
footnote
37,
and
we
wouldn't
have...
i
wouldn't
have--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--and
i
wouldn't
be
standing
here,
because
presumably
all
of
this
would
have
been
solved.
the
problem...
the
problem
simply
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
strands
in
crane.
although
crane--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
right,
although
tax
lawyers
have
no
problems
with
that
sort
of
thing
only
because...
but
the
point
is
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--if
you
get...
if
you
get
basis
in
something,
then
it
has
to
be...
it
has
to
be
considered...
it
has
to
be...
there
has
to
be
a
reconciliation
at
the
other
end
and--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--that's
true...
that's
simply...
that's
true,
although
we
think...
we
think
in
this
particular
case
where
the
concept
of
basis
requires
an
economic
outlay
either
now
or
sometime,
here
where
the
respondents
have
paid
not
a
penny
other
than
the
small
cash
contributions
that
they
made
to
the
partnership,
it
seems
absolutely
anomalous,
to
say
the
least,
that
they
could...
that
they
could
achieve
permanent
exclusion
of
$400,000
of
gain.
this
is
not
simply
deferral
in
this
context;
this
is
permanent
exclusion
of
gain.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
that
is
true,
justice
o'connor.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
simply
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has,
i
think
soundly,
taken
the
position
that
when
value
of
property
is
way
below
a
nonrecourse
debt,
there
have
been
a
lot
of
tax-shelter
activity
in
which
the
nonrecourse
debt
bears
no
relationship
to
the
property.
under
those
circumstances,
the
internal
revenue
service
has
taken
the
position
that
at
the
very
most,
you
get
basis
equal
to
the
value
of
the
property.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
don't
think
it
really
is
hard
to
understand
if
one...
if
one
looks
at
it
from
the
seller's
point
of
view,
the
seller
put
$1.8
million
in
his
pocket.
he
then
bought
this
building.
the
fact
that
it
declined
in
value
has
absolutely
no
significance
to
him
economically
if
he's
allowed,
if
he's
permitted,
if
he
does,
transfer
the
property
along
with
the
debt
so
that
the
debt
is
of
no
interest
to
him
and
the
value
of
the
property
is
of
no
interest
to
him.
and
it
really
is
very
much
like
the
suit
in
the
department
store;
you're
just
not
interested
in
the
whole
transaction
anymore.
and
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
would
say
here
is
that
your
amount
realized
is
$1.4
million.
now,
how
is
it
possible
for
you
to
have
a
$400,000
loss
in
a
situation
like
that
when
you
haven't
expended
a
penny?
and
going
back
to
my
example,
we
talked...
i
think
i
got
off
on
a
tangent
when
we
were
talking
about
depreciation,
mr.
justice
powell.
in
answer
to
your
question,
if
the
property
had
just
been
raw
land,
there
would
be
a
$400,000
loss,
and
there
isn't...
there
would
be
no
loss
in
a
situation
like
that.
there's
been
no
economic
expenditure.
the
taxpayers
here
are
not
poorer
by
a
penny.
and
in
our
view,
that
really...
that
fact
glaringly
calls
for
the
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
his
basis
is
$1.4
million.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
reason
for
that
at
the
bayles
end
of
the
transaction
is
simply
because...
and
there's
case
law
to
support
this...
that
when
the
value...
when
the
value
of
property
is
greatly...
it
has
great
disparity
between
that
and
nonrecourse
debt,
that
basis
ought
not
to
be
the
nonrecourse,
the
value
of
the
nonrecourse
debt
because
it's
almost
like
not
real
debt
in
the
sense
that
it
has...
there's
only
a
fanciful
aspect
of
that,
a
loan
you
pay,
very
much
like
a
contingent
debt,
and
the
courts
have
uniformly
rejected
inclusions
of
basis
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
just
have
a
brief
point.
the
taxing
system...
in
this
particular
case,
the
respondents
borrowed
$1.8
million,
they
put
it
in
their
pocket,
and
then
they
went
and
bought...
and
constructed
this
building.
the
value
of
the
building,
during
it,
their
ownership
went
down
to
$1.4
million.
but
then
they
transferred
that
property
along
with
the
debt.
they
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
debt
anymore.
although
at
one
time
they
had
$1.8
million,
which
they
spent,
they
were
not
taxed
on
that.
the
code
gave
them
basis
for
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
never
had
to
worry
about
the
debt
anymore,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
at
the
time,
if
they
wanted
to
hold
on
to
the
property,
they
had
to
worry
about
the
debt.
now
they
have
given
the
property
away.
the
debt
is
not
their
concern
nor
is
the
value
of
the
property
their
concern.
that
is
the
concern,
as
justice
white
pointed
out,
of
the
bank
because
the
bank
has
to
look
to
the
value
of
the
property,
which
is
the
crime.
the
respondents...
the
value
of
the
property
has
absolutely
no
relevance
to
respondents'
economic
position.
if
they
were
to,
for
example,
buy
a
piece
of
land
for
$1
million,
subject
to
a
nonrecourse
mortgage,
and
then
the
value
of
that
property
would
go
down
to
900,000,
to
two,
to
$100,000,
they
haven't
amortized
the
debt
one
penny.
they
then
walk
away
from
it,
they
abandon
it.
the
court
of
appeals
would
say
they
have
a
$900,000
loss
because
the
amount
realized
is
only
$100,000.
that...
that
is,
to
say
the
least,
absolutely
bizarre.
as
judge
friendly
says--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--a
loss
is
not
recognized--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
i
mean
one
can
do
lots
of
things.
the
point
is
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
what
these
statutes
mean
the
same,
you
know,
what's
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander.
i
mean
these
statutes
mean
the
same
in
the
gain
context
as
in
the
loss
context.
i
mean
the
statute
talks
about
amount
realized
less
basis
equals
gain
or
loss.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
absolutely
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
tax
law...
the
tax
law...
i
mean
the
tax
law
doesn't
give
losses
without
economic
detriment.
i
mean
in
this
particular
case,
they
had
no
economic
detriment
at
the
end
of
the...
at
the
end
of
the
transaction.
in
fact,
as
judge
friendly
said
in
another
context,
any
other
course
would
render
the
concept
of
basis
nonsensical
by
permitting
sellers
of
mortgage
property
to
register
large
tax
losses
stemming
from
the
inflated
basis
and
a
diminished
realization
of
gain.
we
submit
that
the
diminishment,
the
diminution
of
the
realization
of
gain
executed
by
the
decision
below
is
improper
and
should
be
reversed.
