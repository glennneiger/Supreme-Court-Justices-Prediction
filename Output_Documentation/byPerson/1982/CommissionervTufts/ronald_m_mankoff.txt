mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the...
let
me
start
by
setting
at
rest
a
couple
of
questions
that
mr.
smith
has
raised.
first,
we
agree
there
should
be
no
deductible
loss
without
economic
detriment.
similarly,
there
should
be
no
taxable
gain
without
economic
benefit.
the
way
the
tax
system
deals
with
this
is
to
say
there
may
be
loss
realized
but
not
recognized
and
not
allowed.
and
we
agree
with
counsel
for
the
government
that
the
taxpayers
did
not
suffer
a
deductible
loss
in
a
situation
where
they
suffered
no
economic
detriment.
and
the
cases
consistently
so
hold.
so
that
to
the
extent
the
government
contends
that
is
an
issue
in
this
case,
we
have
not
raised
that
issue
except
in
the
tax
court.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
your
honor,
we
raised
the
issue
at
the
opening
of
the
tax
court
case.
we
lost
in
the
tax
court.
we
did
not
raise
it
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
it
was
not
ruled
on
by
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
hold
that
we
had
a
deductible
loss.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not
consistent
in
the
tax
court
below.
we
have
tried
to
abandon
that
issue
consistently,
by
letters
and
representations
and
statements
to
the
government.
but
now
that
they
find
it
the
most,
the
strongest
handle
they
have
to
waggle
at
us,
they
waggle
it
at
us
again
and
again.
we
agree
there
is
no
deductible
loss.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
because
losses
and
deductions
are
a
matter
of
legislative
grace.
they
are
not
given
to
taxpayers
unless
the
internal
revenue
code
allows
it.
income,
on
the
other
hand,
is
constitutionally
taxed,
and
we
pay
taxes
on
virtually
all
income.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
because
there
is
no
economic
detriment.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
section
165
of
the
internal
revenue
code
says
that
losses
shall
be
allowed
unless
compensated
for
by
insurance
or
otherwise.
it's
our
feeling
that
the
"or
otherwise"
constitutes
a
broad
range
of
negative
economic
effect.
that
is,
any
time
the
taxpayer
doesn't
truly
suffer
the
loss,
and
he
may...
and
the
insurance
analogy,
i
think,
is
very
strong...
when
our
car
is
damaged,
we
suffer
a
loss,
but
we're
not
allowed
to
deduct
it
because
the
insurance
company
reimburses
us
for
it.
but
the
loss
has
been
suffered.
just
as
i
think
the
government's
illustration
of
a
piece
of
property
that
we
own
going
down
in
value
from
$1.8
million
to
$1.4
million,
i
think
a
loss
has
occurred.
i
think
something
has
happened
in
the
world
that
shrinks
the
assets
of
the
world
by
$400,000.
so
i
think
to
say
there's
no
loss
begs
the
question.
to
go
further
and
say
that
by...
we
will
manipulate
the
internal
revenue
code
to
prove
there's
no
loss
by
increasing
the
amount
realized
on
this
$1.4
million
piece
of
property,
we
therefore
demonstrate
there's
no
loss.
now,
that
to
me
is
the
ultimate
of
alchemy,
because
a
loss
really
has
been
suffered.
it's
not
deductible
because
the
taxpayer
has
not
suffered
a
true
economic
detriment.
the
cases
say
that
in
situations
like
that,
taxpayers
are
not
allowed
to
deduct
a
loss
even
though
the
loss
is
experienced,
is
suffered,
is
realized.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
no.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
probably.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
clearly
not.
therefore,
no
deductible
loss.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
i
would
prefer
to
reserve...
actually,
it
should
make
a
difference,
sir,
because--
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
--all
right.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
well,
he
certainly
has
suffered...
he
has
realized
no
gain.
that
is
to
say,
he
is
not
a
richer
man
by
having
disposed--
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
--of
the
property.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
exactly.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
exactly.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
well,
actually,
i
think
at
the
start
of
the
transaction,
there
would
be
balancing
entries;
that
is,
there
would
be
an
asset
and
a
liability
in
equal
amount,
whatever
those
amounts
were,
$1.8
million
million
of
asset,
$1.8
million
of
liability.
on
the
disposition
of
the
asset,
both
would
disappear
from
his
balance
sheet.
now,
that
is
the
simple
fact
of
it.
his
assets
are
not
enriched;
that
is,
we
don't
have
$400,000
of
assets
freed
up
by
virtue
of
the
disposition
of
the
property,
which
would
have
been
the
case
had
this
been
liability
debt.
that
is
to
say,
if
he
had...
if
there
had
been
cancellation
of
$400,000
of
liability
debt,
then
other
assets...
stocks,
bonds,
and
cash...
would
have
been
freed
up
and
he
would
have
had
gain.
but
in
a
situation
like
this,
it's
as
though
the
man
owned
only
one
asset
and
owed
only
one
debt.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
i
would
say
we
have
$1.8
million
asset
and
$1.8
million
of
liability.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
well,
are
you
saying,
sir,
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
say
zero
asset
because
it's
on
a--
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
--let
me
say
i
am
free
of
any
misconceptions
because
i
am
not
an
accountant.
i
know
that
a
loss--
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
--the...
the
accountants,
you
know,
when
faced
with
this
situation,
say,
my
goodness,
if
something
has
happened
on
the
left
side,
we
must
act
on
the
right
side.
the
answer
that
i
give
is
that
this
is
federal
taxation,
this
is
not
double-entry
bookkeeping,
that
the
tax
system
very
often
allows
entries
on
the
left
side
with
no
effect
on
the
right
side.
we
give
a
lot
of
deductions,
in
the
oil
industry,
for
example,
that
are
never
offset
anywhere
else
in
the
system.
and
notwithstanding
mr.
smith's
statement,
there
is
in
many
situations
no
reconciliation
of
cost
basis.
we
get
cost
basis
in
a
number
of
situations
that
don't
require
that
we
give
it
back
later
on.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
individuals
who
go
through
bankruptcy,
we
have
cancellation
of
debt,
we
have
no
income,
and
yet
that
debt
may
well
have
produced
deductions,
it
may
well
have
acquired
assets
that
produce
depreciation
deductions.
we
don't
go
back
and
recapture
it.
notwithstanding
what
mr.
smith
says,
the
crane
case
did
not
hold
that
anything
included
in
basis
must
find
its
way
into
amount
realized.
the
only
reference
to
functional
relationship
was
a
common
definition
of
property.
what
the
court
was
saying
was
property
must
mean
the
same
thing
in
the
basis
section
as
property
means
in
the
amount
realized
section
because
we
use
these
two
concepts
in
computing
gain.
therefore,
we
must
use
apples
and
apples.
but
it
didn't...
they
were
not
saying
that
anything
that's
included
in
basis
must
find
its
way
into
amount
realized,
because
they
are
not
related,
because
basis
is
cost
in
one
situation,
or
basis
is
value.
in
mrs.
crane's
situation,
there
was
no
cost
element.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
357(c),
which
has
to
do
with
the
contribution
of
assets
subject
to
liability,
does
not
appear
to
have
a
limitation
on
it
based
upon
the
value
of
assets.
as
indicated
in
the
brief,
however,
311(c),
which
describes
assets
coming
out
of
a
corporation,
does
have
that
kind
of
limitation.
i
don't
know
why
there's
an
inconsistency.
generally,
the
code
and
the
courts
have
treated
fair-market
value
and
economic
benefit
as
being
real
concepts
that
must
be
part
of
our
tax
system,
because
without
them
we
don't
have
a
touchstone
with
which
to
measure
the
consistency
and
fairness
of
our
system.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
i
would
say
first
there
should
be
no
immediate
tax
consequence.
no.
i
think
very
often
that's
treated
as
an
adjustment
of
the
purchase
price
if
you're
talking
about
the
seller.
in
the
situation
you're
describing,
talking
about
the
bank,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
treated
as
adjustment
of
sale
price.
and
clearly,
there
would
be
no
tax
at
that
time,
no.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
we'd
have
exactly
the
situation
we
have
here--
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
--which
is,
there
is
no
gain
realized
without
economic
benefit.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
not
if
he's
not
liable
for
the
note,
your
honor,
no.
this
gets
back
to
what
crane
was
talking
about.
and
the
question
was
asked,
must
we
overrule
crane
in
order
to
affirm
the
fifth
circuit?
and
the
answer
is
no.
crane
dealt
with
only
those
situations
which
resemble
recourse
debt.
they
properly
announced
the
law
as
to
recourse
debt
and
said
that
where
nonrecourse
debt
fits
that
same
situation,
then
we're
going
to
apply
the
recourse
debt
rule.
and
i
understand
what
the
court
was
saying.
i,
notwithstanding
the
government's
inability
to
understand
this
concept,
i
own
some
property
subject
to
nonrecourse
debt.
it
has
a
value
higher
than
that
mortgage,
and
i
treat
it
as
though
i
owe
that
debt,
every
penny
of
it.
and
i
will
pay
that
debt
rather
than
lose
that
property.
and
that's
all
the
court
was
saying
in
crane,
that
in
a
case
where
the
nonrecourse
debt
is
going
to
be
treated
as
recourse
debt,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
treating
the
entire
situation
as
though
there
was
liability.
but
they
did
say,
this
will...
this
probably
is
not
the
rule,
obviously
is
not
the
rule,
where
you
don't
have
a
similarity
of
situation;
where
you
have
a
situation
where
an
individual
will
not
treat
the
debt
as
his
own,
then
it
should
not
be
treated
the
same.
because
we
don't
have
economic
benefit,
we
don't
have
any
advantage
to
the
taxpayer.
certainly,
our
system
is
based
upon
that.
at
no
time
was
the
crane
court
saying
that
there
must
be
an
inclusion
or
a
paying
up
at
the
end
of
the
transaction
for
the
advantage
of
utilizing
basis
or
cost,
because,
you
know,
mortgage
debt
was
not
really
in
mrs.
crane's
cost,
as
such.
her
cost
was
the
value
of
the
property.
it
happened
the
court
said,
the
value
of
the
property
is
the
total
property,
unreduced
by
any
debt.
and
so
we're
not
talking
here
or
in
crane
about
a
situation
where
we
must
replace
that
at
the
end
of
the
transaction.
all
the
court
was
saying
was
that
where
there
is
a
similarity
and
a
resemblance
that
will
cause
people
to
treat
these
transactions
identically,
then
there
is
nothing
inappropriate
about
the
tax
consequences
being
identical.
and
if
we...
a
similar
situation...
if
we
were
at
risk
in
this
transaction
so
that
we
were
in
default
and
a
foreclosure
sale
occurred
and
a
third
party
bought
in
this
property
at
$1.4
million,
and
the
bank
then
said
to
us,
well,
we
want
the
other
$400,000,
and
we
said,
well,
we'll
try
to
get
it
for
you,
certainly
no
one
would
say
at
that
moment
that
we
had
any
gain
in
excess
of
$1.4
million.
no
one
would
talk
to
us
about
the
depreciation
deductions
we
had
enjoyed
in
years
past.
no
one
would
talk
to
us
about
the
necessity
of
the
quid
pro
quo,
if
you
please,
of
replacing
that...
the
cost
basis
incident
to
mortgage.
we
haven't
yet
paid
it,
we
may
pay
it
in
the
future,
or
we
may
not.
but
in
that
taxable
year,
certainly
no
one
would
talk
of
a
tax
consequence
including
that
as
part
of
our
gain.
and
why
should
someone
who
is
in
a
nonrecourse
position
be
treated
less
favorably
than
someone
who
owes
the
debt?
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
mr.
chief
justice,
in
my
opinion,
the
net
worth--
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
--yes.
in...
i
would
make
it
up
showing
a
liability
and
an
asset
in
identical
amount.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
that's
right,
in
the
first
statement.
and
i
would
then
show
a
cancellation
of
both
items
on
the
disposition
of
the
property.
period.
i
can't
conceive--
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
--exactly.
exactly.
it's
as
though
the
man
owned
no
other
assets.
yes.
he
is
neither
richer
nor
poorer.
he
has
used
all
of
the
assets
available
to
pay
this
debt
to
pay
this
debt.
he
has
walked
away
from
the
transaction
with
nothing
that
he
didn't
have
before.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
no,
he
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
he
would
have
gross
income
measured
by
the
rental
income.
he
would
have
a
deduction
equal
to
the
depreciation--
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
--yes.
that'd
be
relevant
to
the
rental
income.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
he
would
also
have,
if
i
may
submit--
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
--yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
given
those
two
situations.
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
yes.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
this
is
the
transaction
in
1970
and
1971.
this
is
the
transaction
to
which
the
government
has
no
complaints,
and
their
question
now
is--
mr.
ronald
m.
mankoff
--the
question
then
becomes,
can
we
rewrite
section
1001(b)
to
correct
earlier
undeserved
deductions?
i
think
the
answer
is
clearly
no.
the
"amount
realized"
definition
has
never
been
rewritten
to
pick
up
earlier
errors.
it
says
merely,
amount
realized
is
the
cash
received
and
property
other
than
cash
received
to
the
extent
of
its
fair-market
value.
that
definition
has
never
been
distorted
or
rewritten
in
order
to
recover
amounts
which
might
have
been
distorted
in
previous
years.
and
it
should
not
be
done
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
mention
however
briefly
the
implication
of
the
partnership
sections
because
in
addition
to
1001(b)
there
is
another
section
that
clearly
applies,
carefully
written
by
the
congress
in
its
section
752(c).
it
is
allegedly
a
rewriting
or
a
repetition
of
the
crane
rule,
and
it
limits
itself
to
fair-market
value.
therefore,
we
believe
it
must
be
a
description
or
an
enactment
of
footnote
37.
and
it
says
that
in
the
case
of
a
partnership,
which
is
what
was
involved
here,
that
liability
shall
be
deemed
to
be
liabilities
of
the
owner
of
property
where
there
is
no
recourse
only
to
the
extent
of
the
value
of
that
property.
now,
the
tax
court
below
said
that
clearly
the
language
of
this
statute
covered
our
situation.
they
said,
however,
that
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
the
752(c)
was
to
apply
only
in
two
situations;
that
is,
where
property
is
contributed
to
a
partnership
or
withdrawn
from
a
partnership.
we
submit
that
that
kind
of
result
limits
section
752(a)
and
(b)
so
unnecessarily
as
to
be
absolutely
ridiculous,
because
there
are
other
situations
in
which
liabilities
of
a
partnership
may
increase
the
basis
of
partners.
for
example,
this
would
mean,
as
was
found
by
the
tax
court
subsequently
in
the
brontes
case,
that
if
a
partnership
acquires
an
asset
subject
to
a
liability
in
excess
of
its
basis,
that
section
is
not
within
752(c)
because
it
does
not
involve
a
contribution
of
property
or
the
withdrawal
of
property.
and
therefore
the
partners
would
get
increased
basis
in
a
situation
like
that.
now,
that
case
was
reversed
subsequently
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
true
debt
involved.
but
had
there
been
true
debt
in
a
situation
like
that,
the
ruling
of
the
tax
court
below
would
have
destroyed
the
efficacy
of
752(c)
in
virtually
all
situations
other
than
the
contribution
and
the
receipt
of
properties.
and
we
think
that
we
all
want
a
fair
and
consistent
taxing
treating
system.
we
don't
believe
that
the
rewriting
of
two
sections
of
the
code
which
contain
clear
and
explicit
language...
that
is,
section
1001(b)
and
section
752(c)...
so
as
to
recover
what
the
government
perceives
to
be
improper
earlier
deductions
taken
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
risk,
is
a
proper
method
of
achieving
a
fair
and
consistent
tax
system.
thank
you.
