mr.
smith,
why
wouldn't
the
approach
taken
by
the
amicus
barnett
solve
your
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
treasury
department
could
subsequently
decide
to
approach
it
exactly
that
way;
that
that's
within--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
framework
of
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
it
be--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--consistent
with
the
statutory
structure
to
take
that
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
a
hypothetical.
if
the
purchaser
here
had
paid
the
taxpayer
$1.4
million
in
cash
for
this
property
free
and
clear--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
taxpayer
had
then
taken
that
$1.4
million
and
paid
the
secured
party
the
1.4
in
full
satisfaction
of
the
$1.8
million
debt,
i
assume
you
would
recognize
then
that
the
amount
realized
on
the
property
was
the
1.4
million,
not
the
1.8?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
doesn't
occur
on
the
sale
of
the
property,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--maybe
tax
lawyers
don't,
but
taxpayers
do,
wouldn't
you
say?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
the
basis
that
the
purchaser
has
in
this
property
is
only
$1.4
million?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
just
a
little
hard
to
understand
how
the
basis
of
the
property
would
be
the
lower
figure
but
what
the
seller
received
is
a
higher
figure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mankoff,
in
the
corporate
reorganization
context,
i
assume
you
would
concede,
though,
that
the
cancellation
of
the
indebtedness
is
the
amount
received
for
tax
purposes
under
sections
357(c)
and
358?
