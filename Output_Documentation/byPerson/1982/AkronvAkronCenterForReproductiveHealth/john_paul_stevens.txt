justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mentioned
the
young
age
involved
here.
is
it
part
of
your
position
that
danforth,
the
danforth
holding
on
parental
consent
does
not
apply
to
people
under
15?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
arguing
in
this
case
that
danforth
does
not
apply
in
the
ages
below
15?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
record
of
the
akron
proceedings,
and
i
am
not
familiar
with
it,
show
a
total
failure
to
consider
the
question
of
maternal
health.
supposing
that
is
in
the
record
before
us
now.
would
your
argument
still
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
of
course,
that
was
true
with
marbury
against
madison
also.
would
you
apply
the
same
standard
of
review
where
there
is
the
legislative
history
that
you
have
in
akron
as
you
would
in
virginia
where
there
is
no
legislative
history?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
landsman,
how
do
you
respond
to
the
argument
that
in
the
abortion
clinic
setting,
the
danger
is
of
one-sided
information
of
the
other
kind,
and
the
statute
is
intended
to
equalize
the
scales?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
true
that
at
least
insofar
as
people
who
are
motivated
by
economic
incentives,
that
there
would
be
at
least
arguably
a
risk
of
one-sided
presentation
by
the
person
who
has
an
interest,
a
financial
interest
in
having
the
abortion
performed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say
the
record,
do
you
include
the
record
of
the
discussions
before
the
akron
legislative
body,
whatever
it
was,
that
adopted
the
ordinance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
a
matter
of
public
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
were
not
presented
to
the
lower
court
by
either
side?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
landsman,
supposing
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
subsection
(b),
that
the
information
was
one-sided
and
therefore
that
violated
the
constitution,
and
what
remained
was
just
hay
that
said
there
had
to
be
something
signed
as
an
intelligent
consent.
then
would
(c)
still
be
bad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
just
had
a
waiting
period
from--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
why
would
it
be
bad
if
you
didn't
have
a
one-sided
presentation
in
the
interval?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
they
don't
argue
medical
basis
for
this.
they
argue
an
ability
to
make
a
correct
decision,
is
in
effect
their
argument.
can
you
say
that
is
a
totally
irrelevant
interest,
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
that
is
because
you
are
not
open
seven
days
a
week.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
is
it
not
correct
that
neither
of
these
clinics
is
open
seven
days
a
week?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
open
two
or
three
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
someone
comes
in
at
5:00
o'clock
on
friday
afternoon,
say,
isn't
there
a
danger
that
the
person
will
be
told,
come
back
monday?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
for
instance--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
can't
say
that
every
person
who
is
asked
to
wait
24
hours
is
going
to
have
these
serious
adverse
consequences.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
tennessee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
akron,
ohio.
