mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
address
the
issue
of
the
standard
of
review.
one
way
to
view
the
cases
now
before
the
court
is
that
they
are
simply
the
next
in
a
series
of
cases
in
which
over
the
past
decade
the
court
has
developed
a
rather
detailed
body
of
federal
constitutional
rules
dealing
with
abortion.
under
that
view,
the
court's
task
today
is
to
consider
about
a
dozen
separate
provisions
of
state
and
local
law
and
declare
each
of
them
either
constitutional
or
unconstitutional.
the
result
will
be
that
the
outline
of
applicable
federal
constitutional
rules
is
longer
and
more
detailed.
we
would
then
await
the
next
round
of
abortion
cases
two
or
three
years
down
the
road,
and
another
after
that.
the
approach
that
we
urge
is
different,
but
consistent
with
this
court's
precedents.
it
involves
two
steps.
the
first
is
a
recognition
that
as
mr.
segedy
has
said,
a
decade
of
this
court's
abortion
decisions
have
now
established
that
not
every
abortion
regulation
is
governed
by
the
compelling
state
interest
test,
but
only
those
that
unduly
burden
the
woman's
decision
whether
to
have
an
abortion
or
not.
the
second
step
would
be
to
declare
that
in
making
that
key
determination,
ultimately
a
judicial
determination,
concerning
which
practices
do
and
which
do
not
unduly
burden
the
abortion
decision,
the
court
should
be
mindful
of
four
things.
the
first
is
that
most
of
the
questions
dealing
with
the
undue
burden
issue
have
substantial
factual
components.
these
cases
are
illustrative.
does
the
24-hour
delay
requirement
lead,
or
does
it
not,
to
a
better
informed
decision?
comparative
safety
of
hospitals
and
non-hospital
facilities.
and
you
could
go
right
down
the
list.
by
the
time
that
a
lawsuit
brings
the
total
issues
into
court,
the
competing
arguments
concerning
these
factual
components
have
already
been
addressed
and
resolved
by
a
legislature
which,
for
reasons
discussed
in
our
brief,
is
better
qualified
as
an
institution
to
deal
with
factual
issues
than
is
a
court.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
issues
are
non-factual...
this
is
my
second
point...
they
involve
a
blend
of
constitutional
law
and
also
policy.
the
resolution
of
these
two
kinds
of
issues,
constitutional
law
on
the
one
hand
and
public
policy
on
the
other,
are
the
core
functions
of
courts
on
the
one
hand
and
legislatures
on
the
other.
so
that
the
real
question
in
these
cases
is
this:
in
those
areas
of
overlap
between
legislative
authority
and
judicial
authority,
such
as
abortion
cases
are,
cases
which
necessarily
involve
both
the
making
of
policy
and
also
declaring
constitutional
law,
should
the
courts
regard
the
process
as
one
of
policy-making
or
legal
decision-making,
or
is
there
some
room
for
accommodating
the
two,
for
recognizing
that
what
is
really
involved
is
a
combination
of
the
core
functions
of
both
branches?
we
believe
that
there
is,
and
that
the
accommodation
comes
about
in
the
following
fashion.
first,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
ultimate
decision
must
be
made
by
the
courts,
but
in
exercising
this
ultimate
and
awesome
power,
the
courts
must
be
mindful
that
the
kinds
of
competing
considerations
that
enter
into
its
decision
have
already
been
taken
into
account
by
a
representative
legislative
body
exercising
its
own
responsibility
to
make
policy
decisions.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
argument
would
still
apply,
though
there
might
be
another
consideration
that
would
come
in
at
that
point.
there
is
an
intermediate
position,
that
at
that
point
it
might
be
proper
for
the
court
in
extreme
cases
to
take
that
into
account
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
defer.
now,
in
fact,
as
mr.
segedy
has
said,
and
as
the
record
in
fact
discloses,
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
legislative
body
that
did
its
job
the
way
it
should,
by
hearing
both
sides
of
those
issues.
and
it
did
reach
these
very
issues
of
which
we
are
talking
about.
the
comparative
safety
of
hospitals
and
non-hospital
facilities,
for
example;
the
extent
to
which
the
24-hour
delay
period
does
or
does
not
lead
to
a
more
informed
decision.
there
is
a
closely
related
consideration,
and
it
is
that
a
root
message
of
roe
v.
wade
and
its
progeny
is
that
the
constitutional
inquiry
related
to
abortion
involves
balancing.
this
court's
decisions
are
replete
with
observations,
such
as
that
in
maher,
that,
and
i
am
quoting,
"roe
v.
wade
can
be
understood
only
by
considering
both
the
woman's
interest
and
the
nature
of
the
state's
interference
with
it.
"
one
of
the
similarities
between
courts
and
legislatures
is
that
both
from
time
to
time
engage
in
the
balancing
process.
one
of
the
differences
is
that
legislatures
do
it
better.
balancing
by
its
very
definition
is
virtually
synonymous
with
policy-making,
choosing
between
competing
values,
and
the
optimum
balance
almost
always
depends
on
issues
of
fact.
to
the
extent,
therefore,
and
this
is
the
accommodation
of
which
i
spoke,
the
judicial
balancing
is
required,
as
it
is
under
this
court's
decisions,
considerations
of
judicial
efficiency
and
also
separation
of
powers
are
best
served
by
judicial
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
same
balancing
process
or
almost
the
same
has
already
been
undertaken
by
an
institution
of
government
which
is
better
qualified
to
perform
the
function
and
within
whose
institutional
bailiwick
balancing
lies
at
the
very
center.
different
states
and
political
subdivisions
will
approach
these
problems
and
strike
their
respective
balances
in
different
ways.
some
will
adopt
laws
diametrically
opposed
to
others.
but
as
justice
brandeis
reminded
us
several
decades
ago,
and
as
this
court
quoted
in
the
maher
case,
"the
diversity
that
results
from
state
and
local
authority
to
attack
a
common
problem
in
different
ways,
even
in
opposing
ways,
is
part
of
the
genius
in
a
federal
system
of
government.
"
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
am
not,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
not
one
of
the
issues
presented
in
this
case,
and
as
amicus
appearing
before
the
court,
that
would
not
be
a
proper
function
for
us.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
neither.
and
the
reason
is,
as
i
have
just
stated,
the
ultimate
decision,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
concerning
these
matters,
is
a
judicial
decision.
but
all
i
am
pleading
for
is
a
recognition
that
both
with
respect
to
issues
of
fact
with
which
necessarily
pervade
each
of
these
decisions
that
is
made,
and
also
with
respect
to
their
factual
non-components,
that
the
court
at
least
take
into
account,
the
fact
that
these
same
kinds
of
issues
have
already
been
faced
by
a
legislature
with
superior
fact-finding
capabilities,
and
have
been
resolved.
the
eighth
circuit--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
yes.
with
regard
to
the
argument,
justice
blackmun,
that
that
is
the
same
standard
that
was...
the
same
circumstances
that
existed
in
marbury,
there
is
a
difference.
as
i
say,
we
are
not
urging
that
roe
v.
wade
be
overruled.
there
are
portions
of...
but
that
is
an
issue.
that
is
an
issue
for
another
day.
but
there
is
a
constitutionally
significant
difference
between
the
kind
of
yes
or
no
answer
as
to
whether
abortion
is
or
is
not
prohibited
by
the
constitution
that
was
involved
in
roe
v.
wade
and
the
subsequent
filling
in
of
the
rather
factually-oriented
details,
and
more
precise
and
specific
details
that
have
characterized
the
decisions
since
that
time.
we
simply
submit
that
after
a
decade
of
this
court's
decisions
which
have
raised
the
question
that
is
before
the
court
as
to
whether
it
is
compelling
state
interest
that
applies
across
the
boards
or
whether
we
have
now
reached
the
point
that
it
is
only
the
undue
burden,
that
rather
than
having
these
cases
come
back
year
after
year
after
year,
with
the
list
of
applicable
federal
constitutional
rules
becoming
longer
and
longer
and
longer,
that
the
time
has
now
come
to
apply
those
principles
that
the
court
has
so
well
developed
in
other
areas
dealing
with
substantive
due
process
to
this
area
of
the
law
which
also
rests
on
substantive
due
process,
and
at
least
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
another
governmental
decision
or
another
governmental
body
also
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
facing
these
same
kinds
of
questions
has
faced
them,
and
that
they
have
resolved
them.
a
final
consideration
is
that
to
whatever
extent
a
public
policy
issue
is
constitutionalized,
all
but
one
of
the
competing
points
of
view
are
eliminated
as
acceptable
alternatives.
one
of
the
cornerstones
of
a
free
society
is
that
the
search
for
truth
is
enhanced
by
permitting
full
and
uninhibited
discussion
of
public
issues
by
leaving
those
issues
exposed
for
a
time
to
the
legislative
process
and
public
discussion.
the
point
is
not,
therefore,
that
courts
should
stay
out
of
controversial
issues.
it
is,
rather,
that
since
the
power
that
the
court
brings
to
the
issue
is,
as
justice
brandeis
again
pointed
out,
and
justice
holmes
in
his
dissent
in
abrams,
to
remove
it
from
public
debate.
it
is
a
power
that
the
court
should
exercise
sparingly.
thank
you.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
very
substantial
parts
of
it,
justice
blackmun.
