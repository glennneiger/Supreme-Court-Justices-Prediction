we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
city
of
akron
against
akron
center
for
reproductive
health.
mr.
segedy,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
suggested
that
no
patient
was
challenging
the
statute,
did
you
mean
to
suggest
that
only
a
patient
could
challenge
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
questions
presented.
there
might
be
two,
or
there
might
be
seven
or
eight
under
that
one
judgment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
landsman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
the
court
make
it
clear
in
roe
that
the
right
is
not
an
unqualified
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
only
that
limitation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
the
use
of
that
language,
that
it
is
not
unqualified,
doesn't
mean
that
it
isn't
qualified
by
some
state
interests?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
just
what
the
doctor
tells
her.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
appropriate
and
constitutional
if
the
cooling
off
period
as
you
describe
it
was
before
the
signing
of
the
consent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
think
this
compares,
if
that
is
the
right
term,
with
the
rather
repeated
disclaimers
in
the
holdings
of
the
court
that
the
court
was
not
endorsing
abortion
on
demand?
when
you
challenge
a
24-hour
delay,
aren't
you
almost
suggesting
that
abortion
on
demand
is
the
order
of
the
day?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
an
out-patient
clinic
in
akron
or
in
ohio
generally
be
licensed
in
the
sense
that
they
can
be
licensed
in
the
first
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
only
traditional
hospitals
can
be
licensed
as--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
ohio,
if
a
12
or
13-year-old
girl
goes
to
a
hospital
or
to
a
doctor
and
he
diagnoses
that
she
has
an
acute
appendix
problem
which
requires
surgery,
will
a
hospital
permit
the
surgery
without
the
consent
of
the
parents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
an
appendectomy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
asking
as
a
question
of
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
at
1:00
o'clock.
very
well.

justice
warren
e.

your
time
has
expired
now,
counsel.

you,
gentlemen.
