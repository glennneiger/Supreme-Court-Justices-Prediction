mr.
stephan
landsman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
akron
ordinance
before
the
court
today
requires
that
when
any
woman
seeks
an
abortion
in
the
city
of
akron,
she
and
her
physician
must
comply
with
at
least
14
separate
and
distinct
requirements
before
the
procedure
may
be
performed.
if
she
is
a
minor
or
she
seeks
a
second
trimester
procedure,
the
number
is
far
greater.
all
the
ordinance
requirements
must
be
satisfied.
none
can
be
avoided,
regardless
of
the
woman's
personal
circumstances
or
her
medical
condition.
any
deviation
from
even
one
requirement
will
expose
the
physician
to
up
to
six
months
in
jail,
a
$1,000
fine,
and
potential
loss
of
license.
i
would
like
to
begin
my
argument
with
a
discussion
of
the
constitutional
standard
applicable
in
this
case,
and
then
turn
to
the
various
sections
of
the
ordinance,
beginning
with
the
informed
consent
script
and
the
24-hour
delay,
the
ban
on
clinical
second
trimester
procedures,
and
the
minor's
veto.
in
roe
versus
wade,
this
court
held
that
a
woman
had
a
fundamental
right,
in
consultation
with
her
physician,
to
choose
whether
to
terminate
a
pregnancy.
as
this
court
indicated
in
roe
and
reiterated
as
recently
as
harris
versus
mcrae,
regulations
restricting
this
fundamental
right
are
presumptively
unconstitutional.
in
order
to
sustain
abortion
regulations,
the
state
has
a
heavy
burden.
either
it
must
show
that
those
regulations
do
not
restrict
the
woman's
decision,
as
this
court
identified
in
the
danforth
case,
or
if
the
plaintiffs
demonstrate
that
a
regulation
imposes
a
cognizable
burden,
then
the
regulation
be
supported
by
a
compelling
state
interest
and
be
narrowly
drawn
to
support
only
that
interest.
mr.
stephan
landsman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
in
consultation
with
her
physician.
mr.
stephan
landsman
your
honor,
with
respect
to
further
steps,
one
would
have
to
ask
what
particular
stage
of
the
pregnancy
we
are
at
and
a
variety
of
other
things.
mr.
stephan
landsman
your
honor,
this
court
clearly
indicated
that
it
is
qualified
by
state
interest
of--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
compelling
interest
in
maternal
health
becomes
a
state
interest
that
can
be
effectuated
in
the
second
trimester,
as
this
court
indicated
in
roe.
and
the
concerns
for
viability
certainly
add
viability.
the
solicitor
general
and
the
defendants
do
not
challenge
this
court's
determination
that
the
right
to
choose
is
fundamental.
however,
they
would
have
the
court
stand
the
burden
of
proof
rule
in
fundamental
rights
cases
on
its
head,
and
force
the
plaintiff
to
show
in
each
and
every
case
an
undue
burden.
it
would
not
appear
that
the
state
has
any
responsibility
under
the
test
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
and
the
defendants.
this
proposal
would
undercut
roe's
finding
of
fundamentality.
it
would
make
all
restrictive
abortion
regulations
presumptively
constitutional,
and
place
the
onus
on
the
plaintiffs
in
each
and
every
case
to
show
their
undue
burdensomeness.
besides
directly
undercutting
roe's
declaration
of
fundamentality,
the
undue
burden
test
creates
other
problems
as
well.
as
the
solicitor
general
admits
in
his
brief
at
page
10,
the
undue
burden
test
is
one
of
breadth
and
ambiguity.
it
is
essentially
a
standardless
and
ad
hoc
test.
in
gertz
versus
robert
welch,
this
court
considered
and
rejected
a
similar
ad
hoc
test
in
the
first
amendment
area,
because
this
court
felt
it
would
lead
to
unpredictable
results,
uncertainty
of
expectations,
and
would
render
this
court's
supervisory
powers
impossible
to
be
enforced.
the
solicitor
general
has
an
alternative
solution.
he
suggests
that
the
judiciary
defer
in
any
fundamental
rights
case
where
a
legislative
policy
choice
is
arguably
at
stake.
it
is
a
rule
as
old
as
marbury
versus
madison
that
the
courts
must
apply
the
relevant
constitutional
standards
rather
than
defer
to
a
coequal
branch
on
that
issue.
there
are
a
variety
of
reasons
for
this
rule.
perhaps
most
important,
any
other
choice
would
undermine
the
enforcement
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights
by
allowing
impassioned
majorities
to
restrict
liberty
interests.
it
would
also
render
impossible
the
task
of
developing
a
coherent
body
of
constitutional
principles.
justice
o'connor
asked
mr.
segedy
what
interest
does
the
state
rely
on
in
this
case.
i
would
cite
to
the
court
the
questions
presented
for
review
in
this
case.
akron
relies
on
one
and
only
one
interest
in
its
questions,
whether
the
state's
interest
in
maternal
health
and
well-being
is
such
that
it
may
regulate
abortion.
there
is
no
other
state
interest
being
advanced,
at
least
pursuant
to
the
questions
presented
on
which
certiorari
was
granted.
the
first
section
i
would
like
to
consider
was
enacted
under
the
rubric
of
informed
consent.
both
of
the
two
parts
of
this
section
that
were
held
unconstitutional
were
held
to
impinge
upon
the
woman's
right
to
choose
whether
to
terminate
her
pregnancy.
the
first
of
these
two
forces
the
attending
physician,
on
pain
of
incarceration,
to
recite
in
each
and
every
case,
without
exception,
seven
scripted
statements,
including
akron's
assertion
that
human
life
begins
at
the
moment
of
conception,
and
a
fetal
description
promoting
that
view,
as
well
as
a
variety
of
medically
inaccurate
assertions
about
the
abortion
procedure
and
risks.
the
second
of
these
two
sections
forces
the
attending
physician
in
each
and
every
case,
or
face
jail,
to
recite
individualized
risk
and
technique
information.
the
plaintiffs
proved
that
the
proposed
requirements
directly
and
substantially
interfere
with
the
abortion
decision
and
its
effectuation
by
robbing
the
woman
of
independence
in
the
abortion
decision-making
process
and
by
straightjacketing
her
physician.
plaintiffs
proved
that
both
sections
deprive
each
woman
of
control
of
the
abortion
decision-making
process,
first
by
compelling
her
to
hear
an
array
of
prescribed
materials
that
she
can
never
direct
her
physician
not
to
recite.
both
the
woman
and
her
physician
may
indeed
face
prosecution
if
the
scripted
materials
are
not
recited
before
every
abortion
in
akron.
there
is
no
exception
under
any
circumstances
whatsoever.
the
second
way
in
which
the
decision-making
process
is
burdened
is
that
it
requires
the
woman
to
consider
misinformation,
and
the
record
demonstrated
that
it
was
misinformation,
that
is
likely
to
interfere
with
her
decision-making
capacity
rather
than
assist
her
in
making
a
considered
choice.
the
third
way
in
which
these
materials
interfere
with
the
decision-making
process
is
that
they
force
her
physician
to
be
the
bearer
of
what
plaintiff's
expert
described
as
potentially
inflammatory
information,
turning
the
physician
into
the
adversary
rather
than
the
advisor
of
the
woman.
the
sections
are
clearly
slanted
against
abortion.
there
is
not
one
word
in
them
that
is
favorable
to
the
abortion
choice,
and
they
treat
women
as
irrational
decision-makers
who
must
be
forced
to
reconsider
their
choice
of
an
abortion.
mr.
stephan
landsman
your
honor,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
the
information
provided
by
the
clinic
is
at
all
one-sided.
rather,
it
is
an
hour-long
discussion
of
the
risks
and
of
the
procedure
and
of
the
options.
in
fact,
in
this
record,
the
district
court
found
that
where
a
woman
indicates
ambivalence,
the
physician
will
not
proceed
with
the
abortion.
the
whole
process
is
to
help.
mr.
stephan
landsman
again,
there
is
simply
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
that
is
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
stephan
landsman
no,
your
honor.
those
materials
were
never
presented
by
the
defendants
in
this
case
in
any
way
to
assist
them
in
defending
this
ordinance.
they
chose
not
to
put
any
of
those
materials
in
the
record.
mr.
stephan
landsman
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
are
tapes
of
those
proceedings.
now,
i--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
were
not
presented.
mr.
stephan
landsman
your
honor,
ironically,
i
believe
that
the
good
news
of
abortion,
the
safety
of
the
technique
and
so
forth,
may
in
fact
not
be
possible
for
the
physician
to
say,
because
the
seven
scripted
statements
must
be
spoken,
and
it
is
unclear
whether
the
physician
can
indeed
contradict
those
statements
where
they
are
incorrect
or
provide
material
that
corrects
their
misimpressions.
if
it
is
indeed
the
case,
and
it
is
unclear,
as
it
was
unclear
in
the
colautti
case,
the
physician
may
have
his
mouth
absolutely
sealed
by
this
statute
and
be
forced
to
speak
only
one
side
of
the
question.
mr.
stephan
landsman
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephan
landsman
your
honor,
this
was
enjoined
before
it
was
ever
to
be
enforced.
both
the
district
court--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--at
a
minimum,
there
is
an
hour-long
consultation
between
a
counselor
or
a
registered
nurse
and
each
patient,
but
in
addition--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--the
physician
had
informed
consent
discussions
with
each
patient,
as
the
district
court
held,
for
a
minimum
of,
i
think
the
record
says
five
minutes,
before
any
further
procedures
are
done.
he
consults
with
each
patient.
he
discusses
with
each
patient
her
choice,
asks
if
she
has
any
questions--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--your
honor,
approximately
five
minutes
in
each
case.
and
further
amount
of
time,
and
of
course
as
much
time
as
is
necessary
for
those
who
indicate
ambivalence,
and
a
recommendation.
mr.
stephan
landsman
your
honor,
in
at
least
two
of
the
clinics
the
informed
consent
section
of
that
discussion
is
with
a
registered
nurse.
in
the
third
clinic,
it
is
with
masters
of
social
work
counselors.
mr.
stephan
landsman
the
record
indicates
that
both
are
done,
your
honor.
mr.
stephan
landsman
that
it
is
done
both
on
a
one
on
one
basis
and
that
it
is
done
in
a
group
setting.
mr.
stephan
landsman
now,
part
of
the
time
is
spent
individually
with
each
woman,
especially
when
the
informed
consent
is
signed,
but
part
is
spent
in
a
group
setting,
although
some
women
may
just
get
the
individualized
counseling.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
plaintiffs
had
proven
that
the
script
requirements
of
06(b)
placed
the
physician
in
a
straightjacket
in
the
practice
of
medical
care.
they
block
any
effort
on
his
part
to
exercise
clinical
judgment.
each
and
every
word
must
be
spoken
to
each
and
every
patient.
there
is
no
emergency
exception
for
this
provision.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
plaintiffs
had
proven
that
section
06(c)
imposes
the
same
sort
of
straightjacket
on
the
physician.
the
details
required
there
can
never
be
omitted.
in
response
to
this
evidentiary
showing
of
burden,
the
defendants
were
unable
to
justify
their
requirements
with
proof
of
its
compelling
nature.
rather,
the
defendants
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
at
least
in
one
of
their
briefs
in
this
court,
that
various
subsections
of
the
informed
consent
are
unconstitutional.
the
district
court
found
that
the
defendants
could
not
prove
that
various
materials
in
their
script
were
indeed
true.
further,
all
of
defendant's
experts
agreed
that
despite
akron's
blanket
requirement,
physicians
must
be
free
to
refrain
from
giving
each
patient
all
details.
finally,
one
of
defendant's
experts
described
the
informed
consent
approach
he
uses
to
obtain
the
consent
of
hospitalized
psychotics
to
experiments
with
psychoactive
drugs.
akron
treats
women
seeking
abortions
as
less
capable
of
giving
informed
consent
than
the
defendant's
expert
treated
these
mental
patients.
the
defendant's
proof
failed
to
satisfy
the
constitutional
standard
required
by
this
court.
rather,
defendants
have
attempted
to
impose
an
unconstitutional
straightjacket
condemned
by
this
court
in
danforth
and
to
rob
the
woman
of
an
independent
decision-making
capacity.
the
next
section
of
the
ordinance
that
i
would
like
to
analyze
is
section
1870.07.
it
mandates
that
every
woman
make
two
separate
trips
to
the
abortion
clinic
by
imposing
a
delay
of
no
less
than
24
hours
between
the
signing
of
the
informed
consent
form
and
the
performance
of
the
abortion
procedure.
this
section
was
held
unconstitutional
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
found,
and
the
defendants
do
not
deny,
that
the
two-visit
delay
requirement
was
designed
to
force
every
woman
to
go
through
a
cooling
off
period
after
signing
an
informed
consent
form.
the
purpose
of
this,
say
the
defendants--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
such
a
requirement
would
have
been
constitutional.
the
purpose
of
this
cooling
off
period
was,
as
the
defendants
have
said
in
their
brief,
to
have
each
woman
mull
over
the
scripted
information
provided
by
akron,
in
other
words,
to
reconsider
in
light
of
the
misleading
and
inflammatory
materials
akron
presents
her
decision.
in
essence,
this
was
an
effort
to
dissuade
her
from
the
choice
she
had
made
and
indicated
in
her
signed
consent.
this
requirement
treats
women
as
if
they
are
not
to
be
trusted
to
know
their
own
minds
or
to
make
rational
decisions,
despite
the
fact
that
over
half
of
the
women
who
come
to
the
akron
clinic
have
borne
children
previously,
and
over
three-quarters
have
been
professionally
counseled
either
by
a
physician
or
another
health
care
professional,
before
they
ever
arrive
at
an
akron
clinic.
mr.
stephan
landsman
your
honor,
would
the
waiting
period
still
be
bad?
mr.
stephan
landsman
yes.
mr.
stephan
landsman
your
honor,
the
waiting
period
would
still
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
stephan
landsman
because
it
imposes
a
significant
number
of
burdens
on
women
seeking
abortions
without,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
any
medical
basis
therefore
at
all.
the
evidence
showed--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
appropriate
standard
is,
does
it
conform
to
a
compelling
state
interest,
and
is
it
narrowly
drawn
to
meet
that
interest?
first
of
all,
as
the
evidence
demonstrated,
it
is
incredibly
burdensome.
it
forces
delays
not
of
24
hours
but,
as
the
evidence
showed,
at
least
two
days,
and
in
many
cases
up
to
seven
days.
mr.
stephan
landsman
no,
your
honor,
it
is
more
because
of
the
privacy
concerns
of
the
women
involved,
and
because--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--that
is
absolutely
true.
mr.
stephan
landsman
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
stephan
landsman
but
that
is
only
a
small
part
of
the
problem,
because
for
each
woman,
she
has
family
obligations,
and
she
has
employment
obligations
as
well.
mr.
stephan
landsman
it
is
not
a
matter
of
clinic
convenience.
it
is
really
a
matter
of
human
necessity.
if
you
are
going
to
lose
your
job,
well,
you
are
going
to
wait
those
two
or
three
extra
days.
you
can't
avoid
it.
it
is--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--your
honor,
a
substantial
number.
in
fact,
lodged
document
number
17
indicates
that
difficulties
of
a
substantial
sort
were
faced
by
70
to
80
percent
of
women
in
tennessee
who
were
forced
to
wait
a
minimum
of
24
hours.
mr.
stephan
landsman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
was--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--the
evidence
in
our
case
is
precisely
the
same,
your
honor,
that
because
of
familial
concerns,
because
of
employment
concerns,
as
well
as
the
medical
efficiency
concerns,
these
delays
are
not
going
to
be
24
hours
in
almost
any
case.
they
are
going
to
be
from
two
to
seven
days.
and
the
health
risks
involved
in
the
two
to
seven-day
delay
were
shown
by
the
evidence
here
to
be
very
serious.
additionally,
your
honor,
an
item
we
have
not
at
all
touched
on
is
the
cost
factor
involved.
now,
by
compelling
women
to
come
and
visit
these
clinics
on
two
separate
occasions,
what
we
are
requiring
them
to
do
is
to
make
two
trips
across
the
state
of
ohio
in
order
to
get
an
abortion.
three-quarters
of
the
women
who
seek
abortions
in
akron
do
not
live
in
the
city
of
akron.
many
come
from
as
far
away
as
columbus,
ohio,
and
various
cities
and
towns
in
west
virginia.
the
cost
factor
involved
in
two
trips
to
akron
will
raise
the
cost
of
abortion
tremendously.
the
alternative,
of
course,
is
to
rent
lodgings
in
akron,
and
to
wait
the
appropriate
amount
of
time
or
more.
the
24-hour
delay
requirement
also
will
impact
on
those
who
have
employment
by
forcing
them
to
miss
work;
those
who
have
families,
by
forcing
them
to
pay
extra
child
care
expenses
and
so
forth.
and,
of
course,
underlying
all
this
is
the
feeling
of
the
woman
that
she
wants
to
have
privacy
in
this
choice.
if
you
go
to
a
clinic
on
one
afternoon,
it
is
easy
to
rearrange
your
schedule
to
do
so,
but
when
you
have
to
go
back
again
a
second
time,
it
becomes
an
issue
that
raises
substantial
questions,
and
privacy
may
very
well
be
breached
in
this
matter
as
well.
mr.
stephan
landsman
i
think
not,
your
honor.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
every
regulation
enacted
by
a
state
that
clearly
burdens
the
woman's
choice,
as
this
does
with
respect
to
cost,
with
respect
to
risks,
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
must
be
justified
by
a
compelling
state
interest.
and
in
this
case,
akron
has
presented
nothing
even
approximating
a
compelling
state
interest,
and
that
makes
this
statute,
this
ordinance
section
invalid.
the
defendant's
response
to
the
showing
of
burden
was
a
concession,
first
of
all,
that
the
24-hour
delay
does
impose
a
restriction
on
a
woman's
access
to
abortion.
that
is
at
page
47
of
their
brief
to
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
defendants
produced
absolutely
no
evidence
to
justify
their
delay
in
the
abortion
setting.
that
is
at
page
17-a
of
the
appendix.
in
the
appendix
submitted
to
this
court
with
the
factual
materials
of
this
case,
defendant's
proof
in
defense
of
the
24-hour
delay
requirement
amounted
to
approximately
four
sentences
spoken
by
one
expert
witness
who
does
not
provide
any
surgical
care
or
require
a
waiting
period
when
he
seeks
the
informed
consent
of
psychotic
in-patients
with
respect
to
experimental
procedures.
this
quantum
of
evidence
fails
to
satisfy
the
appropriate
constitutional
standard.
because
time
is
of
the
essence
in
the
abortion
decision,
as
this
court
noted
in
doe
versus
bolton,
and
defendant's
abject
failure
of
proof,
this
section
is
unconstitutional.
seven
courts
of
appeals
and
eleven
district
courts
have
reached
precisely
the
same
conclusion,
and
struck
down
waiting
periods
of
varying
lengths.
further,
the
blanket
delay
requirement
is
not
narrowly
drawn.
as
concurring
judge
kennedy
in
the
court
of
appeals
indicated,
you
can
never
get
out
of
the
24-hour
delay
requirement
where
it
is
medically
contraindicated,
or
where
previous
counseling
has
been
had,
as
it
has
in
three-quarters
of
the
cases
in
akron,
or
where
the
cost
increases
are
overwhelming.
the
next
section
of
the
ordinance
i
would
like
to
address
is
section
1870.03,
which
bans
second
trimester
abortions
in
clinics
and
requires
their
performance
be
confined
to
jcah
accredited
hospitals
exclusively.
this
is
the
only
section
of
the
ordinance
before
the
court
today
that
was
upheld
in
the
sixth
circuit.
the
plaintiffs
proved,
and
the
sixth
circuit
found,
that
the
jcah
hospital
requirement
directly
and
substantially
interferes
with
the
effectuation
of
the
abortion
decision.
the
circuit
court
found
that
the
section
forces
10
percent
of
akron
women
seeking
abortions
to
travel
to
places
as
far
away
as
michigan
to
obtain
abortions,
or,
alternatively,
to
choose
such
dangerous
alternatives
as
self-abortion
or
illegal
abortion.
the
court
of
appeals
also
found
that
this
requirement
raises
the
cost
of
abortions
for
akron
women
from
between
$300
and
$550.
for
those
women
who
cannot
travel
or
do
not
have
sufficient
funds,
as
the
court
of
appeals
indicated,
those
who
are
generally
young,
poor,
or
black,
the
section
deprives
them
of
any,
and
i
quote
here,
"real
opportunity
to
obtain
an
abortion.
"
plaintiffs
proved
not
only
the
burdensome
nature
of
this
jcah
requirement,
but
that
there
was
no
medical
justification
for
it.
the
overwhelming
scientific
evidence
in
this
case
indicates
that
second
trimester
abortion
procedures
are
safer
than
childbirth.
similarly,
voluminous
evidence
indicates
that
such
procedures
may
be
performed
safely
in
freestanding
out-patient
clinics.
this
evidence
has
led
amicus,
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists,
to
specifically
endorse
second
trimester
abortions
in
freestanding
clinics
up
to
18
weeks
of
gestation.
they
thereby
joined
the
american
public
health
association
and
the
planned
parenthood
federation
of
america.
mr.
stephan
landsman
there
is
no
significant
licensing
provision
from
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
stephan
landsman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
no
alternative,
and
akron
specifically
proscribes
any
alternative
but
a
jcah
requirement
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
stephan
landsman
your
honor,
from
the
record
as
we
have
it
here,
one
of
the
plaintiff's
experts
examined
the
clinics.
his
testimony
was
in
this
case
that
at
least
the
one
clinic
that
he
examined
was
properly
equipped
and
staffed
to
handle
second
trimester
abortions
in
light
of
acog's
standards.
now,
that
was
before--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--that's
right.
that's
right.
but
that
was--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--i
am
not
entirely
sure
of
all
of
the
requirements
that--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
those
requirements
do
specify
a
number
of
special
considerations.
mr.
stephan
landsman
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
that
the
clinics
comply
in
each
and
every
regard,
but
it
is
my
belief
that
without
any
difficulty
they
could
come
into
compliance
with
those
standards
if
they
were
allowed
to
do
so.
the
defendants
offered
virtually
no
evidence
in
support
of
the
clinic
ban
that
they
imposed.
they
offered
virtually
no
evidence
other
than
the
american
college's
now
repealed
standard
of
1974.
in
the
appendix
provided
to
this
court,
the
defendants
do
not
cite
a
single
sentence
or
a
single
line
in
support
of
the
ban
they
would
impose.
in
the
danforth
case,
this
court
invalidated
the
missouri
regulation
prohibiting
the
use
of
saline
amniocentesis
because
saline
abortions
were
commonly
used
nationally,
safer
than
childbirth,
and
their
prohibition
would
force
physicians
and
patients
to
more
dangerous
alternatives.
the
akron
situation
is
identical.
further,
in
doe
versus
bolton,
this
court
rejected
a
jcah
hospital
requirement
for
abortions
including
second
trimester
procedure.
akron's
jcah
requirement
is
identical
to
bolton's,
and
is
similarly
not
narrowly
drawn.
the
next
section
of
the
ordinance
i
would
like
to
address
is
section
1870.05(b),
which
mandates
parental
or
judicial
consent
with
respect
to
the
abortion
of
every
minor
less
than
15
years
of
age.
this
requirement
was
held
both
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
to
impose
a
blanket
veto
on
the
abortion
decision
of
every
minor
under
15.
first--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--your
honor,
the
testimony
in
this
case
with
respect
to
obstetrics
and
gynecological
care
is
that
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
in
akron
and
throughout
the
state,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
will
provide
such
care
without
the
parents'
permission.
mr.
stephan
landsman
your
honor,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
with
respect
to
appendectomy.
mr.
stephan
landsman
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
do
not
know
the
answer,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
a
variety
of
procedures...
there
is
a
case
in
ohio,
lacey
versus
lare,
which
says
that
with
respect
to
medical
care
requested
by
minors,
that
minors
can
generally
agree
to
that
care,
especially
if
it
is
an
elective
procedure,
without
the
approval
of
parents.
in
that
case,
it
was
some
facial
cosmetic
surgery.
that
is
the
information
that
i
have.
now,
with
respect
to
anything
beyond
that,
i
am
just
not
sure
what
the
status
of
the
law
would
be,
your
honor.
now,
this
section,
we
submit,
is
not
properly
before
the
court
today.
the
defendants
did
not
appeal
the
adverse
ruling
of
the
district
court;
thereby
waived
any
claim
with
respect
to
this
matter.
they
cannot--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephan
landsman
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
stephan
landsman
no,
in
order
to
perfect
an
appeal,
you
have
to
identify
the
questions
presented.
the
questions
presented
by
akron
did
not
include
any
question
with
respect
to
this
matter.
mr.
stephan
landsman
that's
right.
they
did
not
perfect
this
appeal.
mr.
stephan
landsman
your
honor,
they
did
appeal
on
other
matters.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephan
landsman
your
honor--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--they
were
permitted
to
argue,
but
they
did--
mr.
stephan
landsman
--mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
answer?
