mr.
solicitor
general,
are
you
asking
that
roe
v.
wade
be
overruled?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
seems
to
me
that
your
brief
in
essence
asks
either
that
or
the
overruling
of
marbury
against
madison.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
lee,
did
you
write
this
brief
personally?
