justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
you
appeal
from
the
judgment
against
you
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
take
it
you
appeal
from
a
judgment,
and
then
you
may
assign
errors
or
points
to
be
relied
on
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
did
dr.
bliss
reside?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
try
to
clear
a
registration
statement
with
the
sec,
they
insist
that
the
issue
of
put
in
all
of
the
bad
news
in
effect,
and
simply
leave
it
up
to
the
issuer
to
put
in
good
news
if
he
wants
to,
but
the
sec's
only
concern
is
with
the
disadvantages
of
the
thing.
do
you
see
that
as
being
much
different
from
this
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
any
of
your...
do
you
represent
the
doctor
in
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
ever
try
to
comply
with
the
statute,
or
was
this
just
a
declarative--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
that
the
defendants
didn't
appeal
the
ruling
of
the
district
court.
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
way
you
take
a
case
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
file
a
notice
of
appeal
from
the
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying,
then,
in
effect,
that
they
didn't
argue
this
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
although
they
appealed
the
judgment,
they
didn't
put
this
as
a
question
presented
in
their
brief.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
these
doctors
testify
under
a
pseudonym?
