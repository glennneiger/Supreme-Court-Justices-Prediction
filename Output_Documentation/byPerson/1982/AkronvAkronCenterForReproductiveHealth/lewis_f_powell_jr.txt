justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask,
is
it
a
fact
that
under
ohio
law,
the
court
that
has
jurisdiction
is
the
juvenile
court,
and
that
also
under
your
law
the
juvenile
court
would
have
to
inform
the
parent
in
every
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
statute
on
its
face
require
the
notice?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
to
the
parent,
and
you
are
saying
that
in
light
of
decisions
of
this
court,
that
would
be
invalidated?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
do
have
the
alternative
of
an
independent
decision-maker--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--but
under
bellotti
2
and
matheson,
certainly
the
view
that
at
least
four
justices
expressed,
notice
to
the
parent
required
as
a
matter
of
law
would
present
a
difficulty
for
your
case,
would
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--counsel,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
in
each
of
these
clinics,
there
was
an
hour-long
consultation
with
the
patient
prior
to
the
abortion?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
not
the
physician?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
five
minutes?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
the
one-hour
discussion
conducted
by
a
registered
nurse?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
one
on
one,
or
is
it
conducted
in
groups,
as
in
a
clinic
we
had
here
from
boston
a
few
years
ago
in
bellotti,
where
there
would
be
six
or
eight
women
of
varying
ages
with
varying
problems?
do
your
clinics
do
it
on
an
one
on
one
basis?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
sir?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
groups.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--counsel,
you
referred
to
the
standards
of
the
american
college
that
allows
abortions
up
to
age
18
weeks.
the
college
standards
refer
in
that
connection
to
freestanding
surgical
clinics.
would
such
a
clinic
be
acceptable...
well,
i
will
put
it
this
way
first.
would
the
clinics
you
represent
qualify
as
of
now
under
the
standards
of
the
american
college?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
light
of
the
college
standards,
did
you
say?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
a
freestanding
surgical
clinic?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
those
requirements
include
a
governing
board,
an
administrative
supervisor,
a
physician,
a
registered
nurse,
specify
very
elaborate
equipment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
my
question...
you
brought
up
the
college
standards.
do
your
clinics
comply
with
those
standards?
