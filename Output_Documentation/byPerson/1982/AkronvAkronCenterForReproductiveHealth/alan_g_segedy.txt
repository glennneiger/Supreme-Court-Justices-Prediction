mr.
alan
g.
segedy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
principal
issues
presented
in
this
case
are
whether
the
state
may
reasonably
regulate
in
the
area
of
abortion
in
a
manner
designed
to
ensure
an
informed
decision
by
a
pregnant
woman
in
a
situation
where
there
in
fact
is
no
physician-patient
relationship;
likewise,
whether
the
state
may
require
parental
consent
or
judicial
consent
as
a
prerequisite
to
an
abortion
to
be
performed
upon
an
immature
minor;
and
finally,
exactly
what
is
the
standard
of
review
that
should
be
applied
in
the
testing
of
abortion-related
legislation.
the
akron
ordinance
was
passed
on
february
28,
1978,
amongst
considerable
controversy,
but
contrary
to
the
characterization
by
the
cross-petitioners
that
this
was
a
drastic
departure
from
normal
legislative
procedure,
this
ordinance
and
the
process
whereby
it
was
enacted
is
probably
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
legislative
process
on
the
local
level.
there
were
at
least
four
public
hearings
on
this
ordinance,
including
an
entire
day
spent
with
expert
medical
testimony
with
doctors
from
all
over
the
country,
and
likewise
an
entire
day
of
legal
testimony
with
respect
to
legal
experts
rendering
their
opinions
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
ordinance.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
ordinance
has
not
been
challenged
by
a
pregnant
woman,
but
has
been
challenged
by
three
abortion
clinics
and
a
doctor
who
resides
approximately
300
miles
from
the
city
of
akron.
this
case
represents
a
real
lawsuit
with
real
parties
and
real
evidence
and
a
trial
that
lasted
for
about
two-and-a-half
weeks,
and
i
think
when
the
court
reviews
the
record,
it
will
be
eminently
clear
that
in
the
abortion
situation
in
the
city
of
akron,
there
is
no
physician-patient
relationship
anywhere
near
what
this
court
envisioned
in
the
case
of
roe
versus
wade.
when
the
sixth
circuit
tested
this
legislation
it
applied
a
two-tier
test;
first,
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
any
legally
significant
impact
or
consequence
on
the
abortion
decision,
and
if
there
was,
the
court
determined
that
there
must
be
a
compelling
state
interest.
the
court
then
concluded
that
if
the
regulation
impacted
on
the
first
trimester
of
pregnancy,
by
its
interpretation
of
roe
versus
wade,
the
state
necessarily
did
not
have
a
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
no,
your
honor.
i
just
point
that
out
in
reference
to
the
considerations
with
respect
to
the
parental
consent
provisions
and
with
respect
to
minors
challenging
the
statute
with
respect
to
parental
consent.
clearly
roe
versus
wade
and
subsequent
cases
tell
us
that
there
can
be
standing
by
jus
tertii
on
the
part
of
the
physician.
the
city
of
akron
recognizes
that.
however,
the
city
would
submit
that
the
proper
standard
of
review
that
should
be
applied,
and
the
standard
which
this
court
has
reiterated
is
whether
or
not
the
regulation
is
unduly
burdensome
on
the
woman's
decision
to
have
an
abortion.
this
court
stated
in
roe
versus
wade,
and
reiterated
numerous
times
that
that
decision
did
not
represent
abortion
on
demand.
the
right
that
is
contained
which
the
court
recognized
in
roe
versus
wade
was
not
simply
the
right
to
have
an
abortion,
but
the
right
to
make
that
choice
either
to
have
an
abortion
or
to
bear
a
child.
the
essential
right
is
that
freedom
of
choice.
the
abortion
clinics
in
this
case,
as
the
record
shows,
make
certain
assumptions
with
respect
to
this
situation,
the
first
of
which
is
that
abortion
is
always
the
best
choice
for
the
pregnant
woman;
secondly,
that
the
abortion
clinics'
interests
always
align
in
essentially
a
one-to-one
correspondence
with
the
pregnant
woman
or
the
minor;
and
finally,
that
the
interests
of
the
state
or
the
city
of
akron
in
this
case
or
the
parents
are
somehow
adverse
to
that
of
the
pregnant
woman
or
the
pregnant
minor.
this
court
has
recognized
interest
in
maternal
health,
potential
life,
and
maintaining
medical
standards.
the
city
of
akron
would
submit
there
is
also
another
important
interest
involved
in
this
area
which
this
court
has
not
had
to
face
yet,
because
it
has
not
come
up
in
any
particular
fact
situation,
and
that
is,
the
city
or
the
state
has
an
interest
in
protecting
the
woman's
own
constitutional
right
of
her
freedom
of
choice
as
to
whether
or
not
to
have
an
abortion
or
whether
to
carry
her
child,
her
unborn
child
to
term.
the
city
would
submit
this
is
an
important
interest,
in
fact
compelling,
and
exists
throughout
the
entire
spectrum
of
the
pregnancy.
the
consideration
of
an
abortion
statute
should
not
simply
be
a
matter
of
determining
that
automatically
there
must
be
a
compelling
state
interest.
i
think
the
courts
below
must
look
at
a
regulation
and
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
any
impact
on
the
abortion
decision.
that
impact
may
be
choice-enhancing,
or
that
impact
may
burden...
be
burdensome.
if
in
fact
the
impact
is
burdensome,
the
city
would
submit
that
there
must
be
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
burden
on
the
woman's
right
to
choose.
if
there
is
a
substantial
burden,
as
in
roe
versus
wade
or
planned
parenthood
versus
danforth
with
respect
to
the
parental
veto,
then
there
must
be
a
compelling
state
interest.
on
the
contrary,
if
the
burden
is
only
insubstantial,
all
the
state
need
show
is
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
the
legislation.
in
this--
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
there
is
another
aspect
to
abortion--
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
your
honor,
the...
in
what
was
effectively
a
cooperative
effort,
the
defendant
intervenors
raised
the
specific
question
within
their
briefs
as
to
the
parental
consent
provision.
however,
the
city
of
akron
also
argued
that
question
at
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
your
honor,
the
intervenors
petitioned
this
court
also
on
that
question,
and
we
can
only
speculate
whether
this
court
denied
that
petition
because
it
was
a
duplication
of
the
city's
petition,
and
therefore,
not
being
aware
of
any
possible
standing
arguments,
simply
determined
that--
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
--when
you
say
"you",
your
honor,
you
mean--
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
--the
city
of
akron?
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
well,
the
city
of
akron
did
also,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
raising
it
on
oral
argument.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
there
are
numerous
questions
in
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
even
more
than
there
are
now.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
yes,
your
honor.
your
honors,
the--
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
the
questions
presented--
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
--correct,
your
honor.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court,
if
the
court
has
concern
about
that,
under
the
o'bannon
case,
which
deals
with
this
question
with
respect
to
the
raising
of
a
question
and
the
waiver,
that
the
respondents
in
this
case,
dr.
seguin
and
mrs.
black,
may
raise
those
questions
under
rule
21.4,
i
believe
it
is,
and
that
is
exactly
the
situation
we
have
here,
as
in
the
o'bannon
case,
where
the
dispute
was
between
hew
and
the
department
of
welfare.
the
city
of
akron
submits
that
the
major
thrust
of
this
legislation
is
not
burdensome
on
the
choice
of
the
pregnant
woman,
but
is
rather
choice-enhancing.
and
the
city
would
also
submit
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
it
is
very
important
that
the
record
be
viewed
very...
very
carefully,
that
as
the
physician
relationship,
physician-patient
relationship
diminishes,
the
state's
interest
in
protecting
that
relationship
increases.
and
what
this
record
shows
is
that
there
is
no
physician-patient
relationship.
a
primary
example
of
that
would
be
that
the
woman
signs
her
informed
consent
form
prior
to
the
time
that
she
ever
sees
a
physician,
and
that
is
undisputed
and
clear
in
the
record.
the
sixth
circuit
struck
down
the
informed
consent
provision
on
the
basis
of
it
impacting
upon
the
first
trimester
of
pregnancy.
however,
this
court
has
upheld
informed
consent
in
planned
parenthood
versus
danforth...
excuse
me,
in
planned
parenthood
versus
danforth,
in
principle,
by
a
general
informed
consent,
and
likewise
in
franklin
versus
fitzpatrick,
by
summary
affirmance,
and
by
implication
in
h.l.
versus
matheson
by
way
of
a
footnote
approving
a
detailed
informed
consent
provision.
again,
the
city
would
submit
that
there
is
this
compelling
interest
of
the
state
in
the
choice
of
the
woman,
that
is,
her
fundamental
constitutional
right,
and
the
city
may
protect
that
choice
by
ensuring
that
there
is
a
physician-patient
relationship,
as
the
court
envisioned
in
roe
versus
wade.
this
provision
creates
no
burden
on
the
woman's
decision,
and
it
provides
flexibility
for
the
physician.
we
would
point
out
to
the
court
in
1870.06(c),
it
is
provided
that
the
physician
shall
provide
such
other
information
as
he
deems
is
relevant
to
the
woman's
decision.
it
is
charged
that
the
provision
is
one-sided,
that
is,
the
information
goes
toward
possibly
what
might
lead
her
not
to
decide
to
have
an
abortion,
but
the
purpose
for
that
is
looking
at
what
is
the
danger
of
risk
of
non-information,
which
way
does
that
risk
go,
toward
the
physician
underinforming
toward
abortion
or
toward
going
to
term?
in
1870.05(b),
the
court
struck
down
the
parental
consent
provision.
as
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
already,
there
was
no
woman
or
no
minor
at
all
who
challenged
this
provision,
only
the
abortion
clinics
and
dr.
bliss.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
in
cincinnati,
ohio.
we
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
provision
provides
the
judicial
alternative
that
this
court
referred
to
in
bellotti
2.
we
would
point
out
to
the
court
also
that
this
provision
applies
only
to
minors
who
are
under
15
years
of
age.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
that
is
not
true.
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
juvenile
courts
of
the
city
of
akron
would
recognize
this
court's
decisions
with
respect
to
parental
notification
and
parental
consent.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
the
rule,
the
juvenile
rule
provides
for
information
or
notice
to
be
given
to
the
parents.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
your
honor,
we
would
submit,
first
of
all,
that
the
juvenile
court
could
disregard
that
provision
as
applied
to
a
pregnant
minor
seeking
an
abortion.
however,
that
would
also
raise
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
permissible
for
the
city
to
somewhere
draw
a
line
and
say
that
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
a
minor
is
not
mature
enough
to
make
the
abortion
decision.
the
city
of
akron
feels
that
14,
13,
12,
11-year-old
girls
are
simply
not
mature
enough
to
make
that
decision.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
that's
correct,
your
honor,
through
the
juvenile
court,
and
the
purpose
of
the
juvenile
court
under
the
ohio
statutes,
in
2151.01,
the
very
first
statute,
is
to
protect
the
minor.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
if
that
were
the
case,
your
honor--
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
--for
minors
under
15.
however,
the
ohio
statutes
were
not
challenged.
they
were
not
litigated.
the
effect
of
those
statutes
were
not
challenged
in
this
lawsuit,
so
there
is
really
no
way
of
knowing
exactly
what
the
effect
would
be
as
applied
other
than
viewing
the
statutes
on
their
face.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
your
honor,
in
planned
parenthood
versus
danforth,
this
court
noted
that
not
all
minors,
regardless
of
age
or
maturity,
are
capable
of
consenting
to
an
abortion,
and
i
think
that
it
is
possible
for
the
state
to
make
a
determination
at
some
point
that
parental
consent
may
be
required.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
as
a
practical
matter,
we
are
almost
always
dealing
with
immature
minors,
minors
of
14,
13,
12.
now,
there
are
certainly
minors
who
might
be
14
who
have
the
maturity
of
a
35-year-old,
and
likewise
35-year-olds
who
have
the
maturity
of
a
12-year-old,
but
it
would
seem
that
the
state
can
draw
a
line
somewhere,
just
as
it
does
for
virtually
every
other
purpose,
such
as
voting,
which
is
a
very
fundamental
right,
as
to
maturity.
if
a
person
would
submit
that
he
is
mature
enough
to
vote
at
age
17,
i
don't
think
that
person
would
get
too
far
with
the
constitutional
argument.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
same
kind
of
line
can
be
drawn
by
the
city
of
akron
with
respect
to
the
maturity
of
minors.
if
it
please
the
court,
at
this
time
i
would
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
briefly
discuss
with
the
court
some
of
the
points
that
are
shown
in
the
record
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
the
abortion
clinics
in
akron.
first
of
all,
the
abortion
clinics
are
commercial
enterprises
that
are
owned
by
laymen,
operated
for
profit.
they
run
ads
in
the
newspaper
in
which
they
advertise
the
finest
medical
care,
the
best
medical
care,
safe
and
legal.
when
the
woman
goes
to
the
abortion
clinic,
she
is
not
going
to
her
physician
or
any
particular
physician.
she
in
fact
has
no
idea
who
the
physician
is
going
to
be
at
the
abortion
clinic.
she
is
counseled
by
lay
persons,
and
many
times
these
counselors
have
no
training.
one
counselor,
for
example,
had
some
experience
as
a
respiratory
therapist.
the
counseling
is
done
in
group
sessions
85
percent
of
the
time,
and
the
record
shows
also
that
the
counseling
is
done
with
minors
mixed
in
groups
with
adults
in
this
group
counseling
session.
one
of
the
clinic
counselors,
as
is
shown
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
247
through
258,
testified
that
all
of
the
information
contained
in
1870-06(b)
is
not
only
irrelevant
but
harassing.
the
record
shows
that
the
patients
are
often
given
tranquilizers
on
standing
physician
orders
before
they
ever
sign
the
informed
consent
forms,
before
they
ever
see
the
physician.
doctor
c,
one
of
the
doctors
testifying
under
a
pseudonym,
testified
that
he
in
fact
treats
his
patients,
his
private
patients,
differently
than
he
treats
the
patients
in
the
abortion
clinics.
dr.
b
testified
that
he
never
attempts
to
judge
the
maturity
of
a
minor.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
because
they
were
afraid
of
harassment
or
such.
i
believe
they
filed
affidavits
to
that
effect
in
order
to
have
that
status.
what
the
record
clearly
shows
inevitably
is
that
in
every
case
the
woman
signs
the
informed
consent
form
prior
to
the
time
that
she
sees
her
physician,
and
she
spends
about
five
to
ten
minutes
with
the
physician,
including
the
surgical
procedure.
the
physician
essentially
at
most,
according
to
this
record,
will
ask
the
woman
if
she
has
any
questions.
contrary
to
what
mr.
landsman
stated
to
the
court,
section
1870.06(b)
does
not
hamstring
the
physician.
he
is
not
required,
or
not
prevented
from
providing
whatever
information
he
would
like
to
provide
in
addition
to
what
is
contained
in
that
provision.
in
fact,
he
can
dispute
that
information
with
a
patient
if
he
so
chooses,
but
he
is
expressly
directed
by
1870.06(c)
to
provide
this
other
relevant
information.
mr.
justice
powell,
in
reference
to
your
question
about
notice
to
parents,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
notice
in
this
situation
under
ohio
law,
if
notice
would
be
given,
would
only
be
after
the
minor
has
gone
to
court,
and
would
be
under
the
protection
of
the
court,
and
this
would
in
effect
be
putting
the
abortion
practice
in
compliance
with
the
other
medical
treatment
in
terms
of
treating
minors.
dr.
seguin,
one
of
the
defendant
intervenors
who
is
also
a
pediatrician,
testified
that
this
is
the
standard
practice,
to
go
to
the
juvenile
court
if
a
minor
needs
medical
attention,
and
the
first
consideration
is
always
to
protect
the
minor,
which
is
also
the
consideration
of
the
juvenile
court
under
ohio
law.
the
second
trimester
hospital
requirement
was
upheld
by
summary
affirmance
by
this
court
in
gary-northwest
versus
orr.
the
testimony
that
took
place
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
and
that
is
why
i
pointed
out
to
the
court
there
was
a
real
lawsuit
here
with
real
witnesses
and
real
evidence,
the
testimony
showed
by
numerous
physicians,
including
dr.
schmidt,
who
was
then
the
outgoing
president
of
the
american
college
of
obstetrics
and
gynecology,
that
all
second
trimester
abortions
should
be
performed
in
a
hospital.
that
likewise
met
the
acog
standards
that
were
in
effect
at
that
time.
with
reference
to
the
current
acog
standards
that
just
came
out
this
year,
they
do
not
say
that
it
is
simply
safe
to
do
second
trimester
abortions
outside
of
a
hospital.
they
say
that
up
to
18
weeks,
they
may
be
done
in
a
freestanding
surgical
facility.
in
regard
to
justice
powell's
questions,
the
abortion
clinics
are
not
freestanding
surgical
facilities,
and
do
not
comply
with
their
requirements.
mr.
alan
g.
segedy
thank
you,
your
honor.
