mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
thank
you,
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
has
taken
inconsistent
positions
in
this
case
as
mr.
meth
has
indicated,
first
asserting
clear
jurisdiction
under
this
statute
and
then
moving
to
a
position
where
we
are
at
today.
the
state
is
saying
that
this
federal
criminal
statute
incorporates
an
entire
state
licensing
scheme
as
a
condition
for
immunizing
persons
who
engage
in
liquor
transactions
on
indian
reservations
to
federal
criminal
prosecutions.
i
would
like
to
go
directly
to
the
words
of
that
statute
and
the
language
that
we
are
dealing
with
today,
the
in
conformity
with
state
laws
language.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
yes,
we
do,
justice
rehnquist.
the
in
conformity
with
language
modifies
the
statement
that
acts
or
transactions
within
indian
country
shall
be
in
conformity
with
state
law
and
with
a
tribal
ordinance.
that
in
conformity
with
language
is
a
convenient
technique
that
congress
has
used
in
other
contexts,
other
contexts
involving
federal
penal
statutes,
the
assimilated
crimes
act
and
the
major
crimes
act,
to
utilize
state
law
as
a
standard
for
determining
whether
that
conduct
may
or
may
not
violate
federal
law.
this
court
in
cases
under
other
federal
statutes,
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
and
the
federal
clean
air
act,
where
congress
has
used
language,
shall
conform
with
state
law,
has
said
that
that
means
that
state
standards,
state
law
would
serve
as
standards
for
regulating
federal
facilities,
but
by
no
measure
would
require
those
facilities
to
obtain
a
state
license.
when
congress
passed
this
statute,
its
overriding
concern
was
to
eliminate
discrimination
against
indians
in
the
sale
of
alcoholic
beverages.
so,
it
is
reasonable
to
look
at
this
statute
and
the
act
or
transactions
language
and
imply
or
assume
that
congress
was
concerned
about
the
sale
or
use
of
alcohol
within
indian
country,
and
by
no
means
was
concerned
with
matters
such
as
licensing
and
taxation
of
liquor
within
indian
country.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
our
position
is
that
that
language
deals
with...
that
that
language
applies
state
law
to
the
sale
or
use
of
alcohol.
that
is
sales
to
minors,
sales
to
habitual
drunkards,
sale
during
hours--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--that
state
law
is
to
be
enforced
through
the
united
states
attorney
or
through
some
type
of
action
brought
by
the
tribe.
the
tribe
would
have
civil
enforcement
authority
under
its
own
ordinance
if
there
was
a
violation,
but
essentially
the
violation
of
state
standards
would
be
enforced
by
the
united
states
attorney.
as
to
a
situation
where
a
non-indian
was
selling
in
violation
of
a
state
standard,
for
example
selling
to
minors,
the
state
has
criminal
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
under
mcbratney
and
draper,
very
early
decisions
by
this
court.
the
state
seems
to
imply
in
its
reply
brief
that
it
does
not
have
that
type
of
jurisdiction--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--there
is
an
additional
mechanism
here
and
that
is
the
federal
indian
traders
laws.
any
non-indian
doing
business
on
the
reservation
would
be
required
to
comply
with
those
laws,
and
they
would
be
licensed--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--in
that
particular
situation,
yes.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
yes,
it
was
initially
designed
just
to
apply
to
a
single
state.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
yes,
the
idea
of
state
laws
applying.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
i
cannot
really
respond
to
that
because
congress
was
very
unclear
in
articulating
its
overall
intent.
it
did
not
tell
us
a
great
deal
about
its
intent,
so
we
have
the
language
of
the
statute.
we
also
have
the
strong
federal
policies
that
have
protected
indian
reservations,
particularly
tribal
members,
from
incursions
of
state
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
if
the
state...
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
state
criminal
law,
particularly--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--that
is
a
state
criminal
statute.
nobody
can
sell
to
minors.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
are
we
referring
here
to
a
non-indian
person
or
an
indian
person?
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
oh,
i
think,
clearly
as
far
as
a
non-indian
violating
they
would
have
jurisdiction--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--as
far
as
an
indian,
i
think
that
there
is
a
question
there.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
becase
1161
was
initially
part
of
the
body
of
legislation
which
was
public
law
280--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--right.
he
must
abide
by
standards
governing
the
sale--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--i
cannot
answer
why
or
why
not.
i
can
answer
that
it
is
my
opinion
that
based
on
the
legislative
history
of
1161
and
public
law
280
that
public
law
280
was
focused
on
a
grant
of
criminal
jurisdiction
to
the
states.
eleven
sixty-one
was
part
of
public
law
280.
it
was
pulled
out
of
public
law
280
because
of
the
concern
by
indian
people
that
the
acceptance
of
criminal
jurisdiction,
the
repeal
of
liquor
was
tied
to
the
acceptance
of
criminal
jurisdiction.
i
would
say
that
if
the
violation
was
directly
related
to
a
transaction
in
liquor
that
the
exclusive
enforcement
procedure
against
an
indian
person
that
was
violating
would
be
by
federal
statute
or
by
tribal
action
against
that
person.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
yes,
you
did,
your
honor.
you
said
that
under
the
21st
amendment.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
well,
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
have
said
that
you
cannot
allow
a
state
to
regulate
on
military
reservations.
we
don't
see
any
of
those
cases...
we
don't
see
the
case
distinguishing
those--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--we
are
not
conceding
that.
in
fact,
that
is
specifically
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor.
we
do
not
concede
that
type
of
regulation.
the
state's
remedy
in
the
event
that
one
of
the
standards
is
violated
in
the
sale
or
use
of
liquor
they
must
go
to
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
we
definitely--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
they
would
not
be
binding.
under
our
view
what
we
are
saying,
and
let
me
clarify
it,
is
that
the
determinations
leading
up
to
the
actual
sale
of
liquor,
the
unique
determinations
of
licensing
and
the
qualifications
of
the
licensee,
the
determination
of
whether
these
premises
are
fit
for
liquor
to
be
sold,
are
within
the
prerogative
of
the
tribal
governmental
authority
under
section
1161.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
if
it
was
part
of
their
administrative
regulations--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--and
tied
to
licensing,
we
would
say
that
it
is
not
applicable.
if
it
was
a
state
criminal
offense--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--that
is
our
position.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
no,
that
would
be
applicable.
that
is
governing--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--that
is
governing
the
sale
or
use
of
liquor,
your
honor.
we
are
focusing
on
the
sale
or
use
of
liquor.
i
think
you
can
reasonably
distinguish
between
the
determinations
about
the
qualifications
of
the
seller
and
where
the
liquor
is
sold
and
the
actual
sale
or
use
of
liquor.
congress--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--that
liquor
can
only
be
sold
during
the
hours
of
12
and
6?
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
then
that
is...
the
indian
on
the
reservation
is
going
to
have
to
abide
by
that.
that
is
going
to
be
a
standard
that
is
going
to
be
enforced--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--that
is
also,
if
that
is
a
state
standard,
that
is
one
that
would
be
applicable.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
i
think
in
that
situation
you
would
have
to
just
ask
if
that
is
a
determination
that
is
leading
up
to
the
ultimate
grant
of
the
license.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
i
agree
with
you.
i
think
that
if
you
say
that
it
is
part
of
their
regulatory
structure,
i
would
say
that
congress
in
enacting
this
federal
penal
statute
did
not
intend
to
incorporate
this
whole
state
civil
regulatory
scheme--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--in
this
particular
situation--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--in
the
situation
presented
by
justice
stevens
that
it
would
turn
on
that
because
the
state
standard
in
that
particular
hypothetical
was
tied
to
the
administrative
regulation,
to
its
civil
regulatory
structure
rather
than
imposed
in
the
specific
statute
imposing
a
criminal
penalty.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
well,
i
certainly
did
not
mean
to
indicate
that
at
all.
that
is
what
this
case
is
about--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--that
is
what
this
case
is
about.
we
contend
that
the
statute
by
no
means
is
a
grant
of
any
type
of
licensing
authority,
nor
does
it
impose
the
state
licensing
requirements
by
way
of
this
in
conformity
with
language.
in
our
briefs
we
go
into
discussion
of
the
previous
decisions
by
this
case,
including
the
moe
decision
which
dealt
with
state
licensing,
cigarette
vendors
license.
now,
that
particular
case
did
not
have
a
specific
federal
statute
such
as
we
have
in
this
particular
instance.
but,
we
do
not
see
any
clear
indication
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
congress
intended
to
impose
a
state
civil
regulatory
scheme
as
a
condition--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--that
is
correct,
and
that
was
against
the
backdrop
of
total
federal
preemption
of
the
area
of
liquor
trade.
this
court
in
mazurie
held
that
there
was
a
valid
delegation
of
congressional
authority
to
tribes,
which
as
a
group
exercised
some
inherent,
independent
authority
over
both
the
territory,
the
members,
and
the
subject
matter.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
no,
i
think
they
may
have
participated
as
a
amicus,
but
there
was
no
real
conflict
between
the
state
and
the
tribe
because
there
was
a
state
license
that
was
required
by
virtue
of
tribal
ordinance,
in
fact,
in
that
case.
i
would
point
out
that
in
that
case
indian
tribal
members
were
subject
only
to
a
tribal
licensing
requirement.
essentially
what
the
state...
we
see
the
state's
position
as
trying
to
come
in
the
back
door
from
public
law
280
essentially
trying
to
obtain
civil
regulatory
control
in
this
area
that
has
been
denied--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--i
think
that
part
of
the
answer
to
that
is
that
indian
reservations
are
beginning
to
experience
economic
development.
they
have
been
suppressed
for
a
long
time.
tribal
governments
are
developing.
they
are
regulating
more,
and
we
have
a
situation
where
non-indian
communities
and
indian
communities
are
maybe
closer
together.
we
have
tribal
authority
being
exerted
to
a
greater
extent
than
it
was
before.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
i
cannot
really
answer
that.
i
do
not
have
the
facts
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
again,
i
would
say
that
is
a
civil
regulatory-type
act.
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
they
could
absolutely
prohibit
the
sale
of
liquor.
they
could
maintain
a
dry
state
and
that
would
be...
if
an
indian
on
a
reservation
chose
to
sell
liquor
in
violation
of
that,
they
could
be
subject
to
prosecution
under
federal
law.
but,
that
would
be--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--the
position
that
i
took
before
on
that
was
as
to
criminal
violations--
mr.
stephen
v.
quesenberry
--our
contention
would
be
that
they
could
not,
that
public
law
280,
that
1161
was
pulled
outside
of
public
law
280
and
was
treated
differently,
that
liquor
has
been
treated
differently
historically
by
congress
and
that
the
remedy
is
through
the
federal
enforcement
scheme.
thank
you.
i
think
my
comments
are
concluded.
