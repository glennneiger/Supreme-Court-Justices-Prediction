justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
also
be
a
federal
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
concede
that
you
can
regulate
it
or
do
they
just
concede
that
the
store
owner
must
abide
by
california
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
right,
but
they
do
not
say
that
california
can
do
anything
about
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
or
any
other
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
do
not
concede
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
a
federal
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
do
not
concede
that
california
can
do
anything
at
all
about
it
if
the
store
owner
was
selling
to
minors?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
say...
if
you
concede
what
you
do
that
the
indian
trader
selling
liquor
would
have
to
comply
with
the
state
laws
except
for
licensing,
hours
and
that
sort
of
thing,
why
couldn't
the
state,
although
it
would
not
have
any,
under
your
theory,
would
not
have
any
licensing
leverage,
why
couldn't
it
go
to
a
state
court
and
enjoin
a
persistent
course
of
conduct
in
violation
of
state
law
and
not
just
rely
on
the
united
states
attorney
who
would
probably
tell
him
to
go
piddle
his
papers?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
a
statute
that
says
nobody
can
sell
to
minors.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
it
says
criminal
or
not,
it
is
a
state
law.
why
shouldn't
the
state
be
able
to
enjoin
the
persistent
violation
of
that
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
referring
to
anybody...
the
state
comes
in
and
alleges
in
court
that
this
indian
trader,
this
trader
is
consistently
selling
to
minors,
and
indians,
non-indians,
and
he
openly
announces
that
he
is
not
obeying
the
state
law
about
minors.
why
shouldn't
the
state
be
able
to
enjoin
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
a
non-indian?
what
about
an
indian?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
concede,
though,
that
whether
the
seller
is
an
indian
or
a
non-indian
that
he
must
abide
by
state
law
except
for
licensing.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
and
let's
assume
that
it
is
true.
he
has
announced
that
he
is
not
going
to
abide
by
this
state
law
with
respect
to
hours
or
sales
to
minors,
and
he
just
doesn't
live
up
to
the
state
law.
why
shouldn't
the
state
be
able
to
enjoin
him,
whether
he
is
an
indian
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
a
state
statute
that
says
no
licensee
selling
liquor
shall
sell
to
minors,
that
would
not
be
applicable
to
the
indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
it
is
tied
to
a
licensee.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
under
state
law,
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
justice
o'connor's
example
there
is
a
state
criminal
statute.
let's
assume
that
nobody
may
sell
liquor
in
the
state
of
california.
now,
could
the
indian
be
prosecuted
under
state
law
for
selling
liquor?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
disagree
with
your
colleague
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
to
some
extent
he
said
that
the
state
could
not
prosecute
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
he
may
be
prosecuted.
that
is
not
just
to
some
extent.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may.
