does
california

the
price
of

stores?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

it
does
regulate
the
hours
during
which
they
may
be
sold,
i
suppose?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

mr.
schwartz,
before
you
commence,
i
wish
you
would
try
to
clarify
for
me
exactly
what
the
federal
government
thinks
that
the
state
may
regulate,
and
i
am
thinking
primarily
about
matters
such
as
sunday
operation,
hours
of
operation,
sales
to
minors,
location
of
stores.
may
the
state
regulate
all
of
those
under
the
government's
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
determine
whether
they
can
operate
on
sunday
or
not,
when
they
must
close,
et
cetera.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but,
only
the
federal
government
can
enforce
them?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
state
could
revoke
the
license
if
these
regulations
were
violated?
