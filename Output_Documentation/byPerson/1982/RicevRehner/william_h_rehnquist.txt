it
is
not
just
limited
to
criminal
jurisdiction,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
meth,
wasn't
the
principle
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
against
you,
its
conclusion
that
1161
was
not
an
express
grant
of
legislative
jurisdiction
to
the
states
to
regulate
liquor
sales
on
reservations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
any
observations
it
might
have
had
or
might
have
had
in
the
back
of
its
mind
about
the
importance
of
a
california
liquor
license
i
would
think
would
probably
be
secondary
to
that
conclusion,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
are
getting
their
liquor
from
the
same
oklahoma
place
that
the
california
wholesalers
wanted
to
get
it
from
in
that
oklahoma
connection
case,
aren't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
quesenberry,
do
you
basically
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
construction
of
that
relevant
part
of
that
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
quesenberry,
what
is
the
effect,
in
your
view,
of
the
in
conformity
language
insofar
as
it
talks
about
conformity
with
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
such
act
or
transaction
occurs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
was
that
state
law
to
be
enforced?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
your
distinction
turn
on
the
difference
between
a
regulation
and
a
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
particular
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
they
certainly
did
decide
in
1161
to
treat
liquor
transactions
differently
than
cigarette
transactions
and
that
sort
of
thing,
which
really
are
not
covered
by
a
specific
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mazurie
was
basically
an
argument
between
a
private
individual
and
the
federal
government
prosecuting
as
on
the
basis
of
an
indian
regulation
and
argue
unlawful
delegation
and
that
sort
of
thing.
the
state,
wyoming,
was
not
involved
in
mazurie
at
all.
