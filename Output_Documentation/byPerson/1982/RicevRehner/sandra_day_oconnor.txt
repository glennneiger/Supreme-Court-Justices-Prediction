justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
clarify
one
thing,
mr.
meth,
at
the
outset.
the
state
of
california
does
not
base
any
reliance
in
this
case
on
any
jurisdiction
it
might
have
obtained
under
public
law
280?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
why
is
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
also
some
forms
of
civil
jurisdiction,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then,
it
is
your
position
that
it
would
not
encompass
liquor
licensing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
any
event,
public
law
280
is
applicable
in
the
state
of
california?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
because
of
the
bryan
interpretation
that
you
opted
to
drop
any
reliance
on
280,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
california
has
amended
its
laws,
i
take
it,
to
make
it
possible
for
wholesalers
to
sell
to
unlicensed
establishments
on
the
reservation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
california
has
kept
on
the
books,
at
least,
its
requirements
that
these
establishments
be
licensed
so
you
assert
it
is
not
moot?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
only
criminal
jurisdiction...
you
would
have
to
go
through
the
processes
of
trying
to
get
criminal
prosecutions
as
opposed
to
some
kind
of
suspension
of
the
license
or
other
disciplinary
action
as
an
administrative
matter,
in
your
view,
and
under
the
view
of
the
ca
9?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
provided
the
state
authorities
could
convince
the
federal
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
take
some
kind
of
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
may
be
quite
a
difficult
task.
let
me
ask
you,
this
statute,
1161,
arose
really
out
of
situation
that
existed
in
the
state
of
arizona,
did
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
and
later
in
the
process
of
the
congressional
hearings
it
was
expanded
to
encompass
other
states
as
well
and
to
remove
the
disabilities
that
the
federal
law
had
imposed
on
the
use
and
possession
of
alcohol
on
reservations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
during
the
course
of
the
legislative
history
there
was
some
indication,
at
least,
by,
i
think,
then
representative
john
rhodes
and
maybe
others,
it
was
their
understanding
that
state
laws
would
then
apply
in
the
liquor
area,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
the
thing
that
concerns
me
a
little
bit
about
the
history,
which
is
far
from
clear,
of
course,
is
that
at
least
in
arizona
where
all
of
this
emerged
many
of
the
reservations
are
right
there
in
urban
areas,
in
scottsdale,
in
the
heart
of
scottsdale,
all
along
the
colorado
river
where
there
are
now
casinos
developing
and
quite
a
population
area.
do
you
think
that
congress
may
have
been
concerned
about
applying
the
full
state
administrative
mechanism
in
those
areas?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
quesenberry,
why
couldn't
the
state
of
california
simply
make
selling
liquor
without
a
license
a
crime
and
punish
them
for
a
crime?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
they
make
it
a
criminal
offense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
really
base
its
holding
on
the
theory
that
it
was
a
tax
which
the
government
had
argued,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
you
could
have
argued
just
simply
that
the
federal
laws
on
indian
traders
preempted
in
this
area
but
not
make
the
further
distinction
that
you
appear
to
be
trying
to
make.
