justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
then,
what
is
california's
view
about...
assume
you
prevail,
how
will
you
enforce
your
victory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
supposing
your
opponent
decides
just
to
start
selling
liquor.
what
can
you
do
about
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
news
to
me.
i
am
still
not
sure
i
understand
the
answer
to
my
question.
let
me
give
you
two
questions.
one,
supposing
somebody
sells
liquor
without
a
license
on
an
indian
reservation.
secondly,
suppose
someone
who
may
have
a
license
on
an
indian
reservation
violates
some
after-hours,
sells
at
the
wrong
time
of
day,
or
something
like
that.
what
can
california
do
about
either
of
those
situations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
federal
attorney,
or
the
california
attorney?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you...
oh,
i
see,
under
public
law
280
you
would
enforce
even
the
jurisdiction
that
is
left
under
the
court
of
appeals
holding
criminally
in
the
state
courts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
indicated
earlier
these
stores
would
sell
to
non-indians,
i
assume.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
are
some
checkerboard
reservations,
aren't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
concede,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
that
the
indians
must
obey
those
state
standards
that
you
agree
are
applicable
within
the
reservation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
some
state
standards,
and
you
are
not
concerned
in
this
case
about
how
they
enforce
them.
you
are
just
saying
the
only
state
standard
you
do
not
have
to
obey
is
the
licensing
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
state
standards
that
are
merely
implementations
of
a
licensing
requirement,
such
as
those
things
that
they
say
if
you
do
a,
b,
and
c,
then
your
license
may
be
revoked,
but
there
is
no
criminal
state
sanctions.
are
they
binding,
or
not,
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
include,
for
example,
method
of
operation,
for
example,
the
problem
justice
marshall
brought
up
about
the
obscene
dancing
which
is
in
one
of
their
administrative
regulations
but
is
not
a
criminal
offense.
you
say
that
regulation
does
not
apply
within
the
reservation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
your
real
position
is
there
is
no
licensing
requirement
and
no
requirement
that
merely
relates
to
licensing
is
enforceable
within
the
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
those
that
justice
brennan
gave
you
were
not
in
any
state
statute
but
were
merely
in
regulations
promulgated
by
the
liquor
authority
saying
that
every
licensee
must
do
the
following
or
his
license
will
be
revoked.
then,
under
your
view,
they
would
not
be
enforceable,
as
i
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assume
it
is,
that
the
only
source
of
state
law
is
that
if
you
do
not
follow
these
rules
your
license
will
be
revoked.
that
is
our
hypothesis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
their
trying
to
gain
control?
this
statute
was
passed
30
years
ago.
why
do
you
suppose
it
took
so
long
for
this
issue
to
get
here?
i
know
there
was
an
interior
department
opinion
in
1971
that
indicated
that
you
were
correct.
before
that
had
anybody
tried
to
get
these
licenses,
before
that
1971...
what
took...
i
do
not
understand
why
it
takes
30
years
for
this
issue
to
arise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
that
prior
to
1971
that
there
was
no
attempt
to
get
any
liquor
license
within
an
indian
reservation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
then...
you
do
take
a
different
view.
say
they
have
a
regulation
that
says,
no
obscene
dancing
in
a
liquor
establishment,
and
anyone
who
violates
this
regulation
can
have
his
license
revoked,
but
there
is
no
criminal
prohibition
against
it.
is
that
enforceable
or
is
it
not,
in
indian
reservations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
find
that
in
the
text
of
1161,
that
distinction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
would
you
say
that
a
person
who
runs
a
liquor
establishment
in
which
there
is
the
kind
of
dancing
i
described
that
violates
a
state
regulation,
is
that
liquor
being
sold
in
conformity
with
state
law
within
the
meaning
of
1161?
you
say
it
is,
even
though
it
violates
a
plain
rule
of
california
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the
question
is
whether
the
person
within
the
meaning
of
1161
has
been
acting
in
conformity
with
state
law.
that
is
what
that
statute
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
conforming
with
some
state
laws?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
suppose
those
criteria
were
made
specific,
such
as
you
cannot
get
a
license
if
you
are
convicted
of
a
felony.
another
state,
not
california,
has
a
law
that
you
cannot
sell
liquor
if
you
have
been
convicted
of
a
felony.
that
law
could
be
enforced
in
the
other
state
but
not
california,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
find
any
support
for
this
in
either
the
language
of
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history,
this
rather
subtle
distinction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
equally
intrusive
as
to
its
own
citizens.
it
treats
them
exactly
like
it
treats
the
people
who
live
in
california
off
a
reservation.
