justice
thurgood
marshall
that
only
applies
to
california
territorial
land,
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
the
indian
reservation
part
of
the
territorial
land
of
california?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
also
enforce
the
laws
about
obscene
dancing
in
a
liquor
place
on
an
indian
reservation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
that,
you
could.
that
is
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
you
could
enforce
on
an
indian
reservation
the
regulation
of
the
california
liquor
board
that
you
cannot
have
obscene
dancing
in
a
place
that
sells
liquor--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and,
you
can
enforce
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
did
not
mention
federal.
i
said
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
obscene
dancing--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--i
thought
a
case
came
up
here
from
california--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--i
thought
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
we
upheld
it,
didn't
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
a
state
rule,
not
federal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i
am
saying
is
the
courts
will
enforce
that
rule
on
an
indian
reservation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
think
that
the
department
would
know
what
was
going
on
in
an
indian
reservation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
is
the
department?
what
city
is
it
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
have
one
on
the
indian
reservation?
of
course,
they
do
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
how
would
they
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
indians?
indian
investigators?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was,
do
they
have
any
indians?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know
they
don't,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
know
that
they
don't
have
any?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
for
example,
do
you
have
a
rule
in
california
that
says
you
cannot
have
one
near
a
church?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
churches
do
you
have
on
the
reservations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
sure
you
don't,
and
i
doubt
anybody
else
does.
that
is
my
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
decide
what
is
best
for
the
indians?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
we
say
that
you
could
not
enforce
a
state
liquor
law
on
an
army
base?
we
said
that,
i
think.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
didn't
you
bring
it
up
a
minute
ago?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
frankly
don't
see
where
a
state
gets
a
right
to
regulate
the
liquor
drinking
on
a
reservation
by
indians.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
that
the
indian
reservations
are
subject
to
the
licensing
provisions
of
california?
do
you
agree
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
sounded
like
you
did
a
minute
ago.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
it
is.
counsel,
the
statute
says,
"no
one
indian
or
otherwise
in
the
state
of
california
may
sell
liquor
to
a
minor.
"
can
that
be
enforced?
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
the
state?
they
could
send
in
an
officer
and
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
statute
could
be
enforced?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
far
would
you
go?
where
are
you
going
to
draw
the
line
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
also
a
regulation
by
the
state
liquor
board
which
says
that
nobody
operating
a
licensee
place
shall
sell
to
a
minor.
would
that
make
the
criminal
statute
invalid?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do.
you
say
the
difference
is
between
whether
it
is
criminal
or
it
is
a
regulation.
i
have
given
you
one
that
you
have
both.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
are
they
both
good,
or
is
one
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
just
do
not
understand
how
you
say
that
you
can
do
one
by
merely
putting
the
word
criminal
on
it.
unless
you
put
criminal
on
it,
it
does
not
work.
