mr.
alan
s.
meth
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
under
the
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
ninth
circuit
to
review
a
decision
of
that
court
which
held
that
california
did
not
have
the
authority
to
regulate
through
licensing
indian
country
liquor
transactions.
in
so
doing,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
which
had
upheld
the
right
of
california
to
regulate
through
licensing
indian
country
liquor
transactions.
this
case
asked
the
court
to
resolve
two
well-established
and
entirely
distinct
principles.
on
the
one
hand
is
the
principle
that
indians
and
indian
tribes
are
to
be
left
free
of
state
control
and
their
affairs
governed
by
themselves
and
by
the
united
states.
the
other
principle
is
that
it
is
the
states
which
have
the
authority
to
determine
how
liquor
transactions
within
the
state's
borders
are
to
take
place.
this
case
began
about
six
years
ago
when
respondent,
who
is
a
tribal
indian
living
on
a
reservation
in
a
northern
part
of
san
diego
county,
the
pala
reservation,
requested
that
she
be
allowed
to
sell
distilled
spirits
from
her
general
store,
which
is
located
on
the
pala
indian
reservation.
she
made
the
request
to
the
california
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control,
which
has
the
authority
under
california
law
to
require
and
enforce
california's
liquor
licensing
system.
the
department
denied
respondent's
request
for
an
exemption
from
california's
liquor
licensing
laws,
and
respondent
then
filed
suit
in
the
district
court
seeking
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
and,
the
basis
for
that
suit
was
that
as
a
tribal
indian
seeking
to
sell
distilled
spirits
from
her
store
located
in
indian
country
she
was
exempt
from
california's
liquor
licensing
laws.
the
department
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
or
for
summary
judgment,
and
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
department
that
it
had
the
authority
to
require
licenses,
and,
therefore
dismissed
the
complaint.
the
case
was
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
which,
after
a
lengthy
stay
in
that
court,
reversed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
held
that
california's
liquor
licensing
laws
as
opposed
to
its
state
substantive
laws
had
no
impact
in
indian
country
and
need
not
be
followed.
this
case
thus
presents
the
question
whether
a
state
has
the
authority
to
require
tribal
indians
to
obtain
a
state
license
if
state
law
requires
the
license
be
obtained
before
liquor
transactions
take
place
in
indian
country.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
public
law
280,
as
we
read
it,
is
a
criminal
jurisdictional
type
of
statute.
the
request
made
in
this
case
was
solely
for
a
license.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
correct.
public
law
280--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--the
criminal
and
civil
jurisdiction
which
california
has
under
public
law
280
may
come
into
play
somewhere
further
down
the
line
if
respondent
is
required
to
obtain
a
license
and
then
doesn't
act,
which
is
both
punishable
under
the
licensing
system
and
the
criminal
system.
if
it
is
punishable
under
the
criminal
system,
public
law
280
would
give
california
the
authority
to
punish
that
act
criminally.
but,
as
far
as
the
disciplinary
action
which
california
through
the
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control
would
take
against
respondent
under
the
licensing
system,
that
authority,
we
believe,
is
contained
in
section
1161.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
correct.
california
is
a
public
law
280
state.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
no,
civil
jurisdiction,
as
this
court
construed
public
law
280
in
bryan
that
it
relates
to
criminal
and
civil,
but
civil
jurisdiction
was
limited
by
the
court
to
causes
of
action
cases
where
a
court's
services
were
required,
and
it
excluded--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--that
is
correct.
before
1953
this
question
would
not
have
arisen,
for
the
simple
fact
that
indian
country
was
dry.
beginning
in
1802,
federal
legislation
prohibited
the
introduction
of
liquor
into
indian
country.
in
1832,
the
prohibitions
were
made
criminal.
so,
under
federal
law,
as
well
as
state
law,
a
number
of
states
also
regulated
liquor
transactions
with
indians.
beginning
in
1832,
liquor
transactions
with
indians
either
on
the
reservation
or
off
the
reservation
were
prohibited.
the
federal
prohibitions
are
now
contained
in
18
u.s.c.
sections
1154
and
1156.
in
1953,
congress
passed
18
u.s.c.
section
1161,
which
removed
the
federal
criminal
penalties
unconditionally
if
the
transaction
occurred
off
the
reservation.
with
respect
to
on
the
reservation,
acts
or
transactions
occurring
in
indian
country,
the
federal
penalties
were
removed
conditionally,
the
conditions
being
that
the
acts
or
transactions
had
to
conform
both
with
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
the
acts
or
transactions
occurred
and
an
ordinance
duly
adopted
by
the
tribe
having
jurisdiction
over
that
area
of
indian
country.
the
department
asserted
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
agreed
that
california
had
the
authority
to
require
respondent
to
obtain
a
license.
before
i
analyze
section
1161,
with
respect
to
what
it
actually
says,
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
the
court
to
consider
what
the
statute
does
not
say
in
light
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
was
based
primarily
on
the
concept
of
jurisdiction,
and
as
i
have
indicated
before,
california
is
not
asserting
criminal
or
civil
jurisdiction
in
the
public
law
280
sense
under
this
statute.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
california's
liquor
licensing
laws
are
enforced
administratively.
a
license
is
in
effect
a
decision
by
the
department
of
alcoholic--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--the
sale
of
liquor
without
a
license
in
california
is
a
crime.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
i
would
think
that
the
local
district
attorney
the
department
of
alcoholic
beverage
control
has
no
criminal--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--pardon
me?
mr.
alan
s.
meth
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
there
are
two
ways
that
california
enforces
its
liquor
laws.
the
primary
way
is
through
licensing,
and
in
that
way
the
department
can
take
action
against
the
license
and
if
it
determines
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
law,
then
the
department
can
suspend,
for
a
short
period
of
time,
the
license,
the
business
operation,
or
the
department
can
revoke
the
license
and
put
the
licensee
out
of
business.
the
alternative
method
is
if
the
local
district
attorney
decides
that
if
the
act
is
a
criminal
offense,
and
as
his
honor
mentioned,
after-hours
sale
is
a
criminal
act,
the
district
attorney
could
take--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--california
attorney
under
public
law
280.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
off
the
reservation,
those
penalties
or
those
prohibitions
are
contained
in
the
department's
regulations.
the
department
is
the
california
licensing
agency.
if
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
upheld,
the
california
licensing
agency
would
not
have
any
authority
in
indian
country,
and
so
those
regulations,
i
submit,
would
not
be
the
kinds
of
things
that
if
respondent
violated...
if
respondent
were
operating
a
bar
instead--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--the
only
way
that--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--that
is
correct.
it
is
not
a
crime--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--only
administratively,
your
honor.
only
by
action
against
the
licensee.
those
prohibitions
are
contained
in
the
department's
regulations,
and
those
regulations
are
not
crimes.
so,
by
virtue
of
the
limited
authority
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
given
the
department,
a
violation
of
one
of
those
regulations
would
not
result
in
a
federal
crime.
so,
there
would
not
be
any
federal
criminal
sanctions
against
nude
dancing.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
it
is
not
a
state
crime
either.
if
they
are
only
contained--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--those
are
contained--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--california
versus
larue--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--in
1972.
the
court
upheld--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--the
department's
regulations--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--but
it
was
a
state
regulatory
rule--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--if
the
court
gives
the
department
the
authority
to
require
licensing.
if
the
department
does
not
have
the
authority
to
license
and
to
take
action
against
the
license,
those
prohibitions
cannot
be
enforced.
that
is
the
basic
distinction
between
the
criminal
system
of
enforcing
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
act
and
the
administrative
system
for
implementing
that
act.
only
regulations
promulgated
by
the
department
which
are
not
crimes
could
not
be
determined
to
be
substantive
state
standards
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
are
those
matters
which
result
in
federal
crimes.
so,
the
entire
regulatory
scheme
of
the
department
would
be
inapplicable.
the
only
other
case
to
reach
this
court
involving
section
1161
is
united
states
versus
mazurie
in
1975.
i
believe
that
that
is
a
very
important
case
on
the
matter
of
this
jurisdiction.
in
that
case
non-indians
were
convicted
of
the
federal
offense
of
violating
section
1154
because
they
had
not
obtained
tribal
licenses.
the
tribal
ordinance
required
that
anyone
selling
liquor
in
an
indian
reservation
on
that
indian
reservation
had
to
obtain
a
tribal
license.
the
mazuries
obtained
state
licenses
and
so
they
were
in
conformity
with
the
state
law,
but
they
had
not
obtained
tribal
licenses.
by
virtue
of
that
act,
not
obtaining
tribal
licenses,
the
tribal
license,
they
were
convicted
in
federal
court
of
violating
section
1154.
all
california
is
asking
is
to
have
the
same
power.
the
tribes
in
that
situation
in
mazurie
did
not
have
criminal
jurisdiction
over
the
non-indians.
this
court's
decision
in
oliphant
made
that
clear.
the
jurisdiction
was
not
an
issue,
and
it
should
not
be
an
issue.
the
only
authority,
the
only
governmental
entity
which
we
know
has
jurisdiction
over
indian
country
liquor
transactions
and,
in
fact,
all
acts
committed
on
an
indian
reservation
is
the
united
states.
the
united
states
had
jurisdiction
over
the
non-indians
in
the
mazurie
case.
the
united
states
has
jurisdiction
over
respondent
because
she
is
an
indian.
in
this
case
the
united
states
has
the
jurisdiction.
in
this
case,
all
we
are
saying,
all
california
is
saying
is
that
it
has
the
authority
to
set
the
conditions
under
which
lawful
indian
country
liquor
transactions
are
to
take
place,
and
if
state
law
requires
a
license,
just
like
if
a
tribal
ordinance
requires
a
license,
then
the
person
desiring
to
engage
in
liquor
traffic
in
indian
country
has
to
obtain
a
license.
that
is
all
this
case
is
about.
i
suggest
the
proper
way
to
analyze
this
case
is
the
way
this
court
did
in
a
number
of
cases
cited
in
both
of
the
briefs,
california
versus
the
united
states,
epa
versus
state
water
resources
control
board,
and
hancock
versus
train.
in
all
three
of
those
cases,
the
court
was
faced
with
a
situation
where
a
state
was
requiring
a
federal
agency
to
obtain
a
license.
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
court
looked
at
the
statute,
looked
at
the
entire
statutory
scheme,
looked
at
the
legislative
history
and
looked
at
anything
else
that
the
court
thought
was
relevant
to
this
situation.
but,
the
court
did
not
base
its
decision
on
the
fact
that
a
state
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
secretary
of
interior.
only
if
congress
has
given
a
state
the
power
to
require
the
secretary
of
interior
to
obtain
a
license
can
a
state
make
the
secretary
of
interior
obtain
a
license.
that
is
all
we
are
asking
for
in
this
case
is
for
the
court
to
look
at
the
statute,
look
at
the
legislative
history,
look
at
the
various
relationships
and
determine
whether
california
has
the
power
to
require
a
license.
i
do
not
believe
it
would
be
fruitful
at
all
for
the
court
to
go
into
the
matter
of
jurisdiction.
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
assume
that
the
california
license
was
nothing
more
than
a
piece
of
paper,
which
simply
allows
someone
to
do
an
act.
california's
liquor
licensing
scheme
is
much
more
than
that,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court's
decision
that
only
a
state's
substantive
standards
as
opposed
to
its
licensing
scheme
is
a
valid
one.
california
both
in
its
constitution
and
in
its
statutes
has
declared
that
a
licensing
system
is
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
health,
welfare,
safety
and
keeps
the
morals
of
its
people,
and
the
system
is
designed
to
eliminate
what
it
views
as
the
evils
of
unlicensed
liquor
traffic
within
the
state.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
yes,
they
can,
your
honor.
the
statute
is
not
limited
with
respect
to
the
identity
of
the
seller
or
the
identity
of
the
buyer.
so,
anyone
can
sell
under
this
statute
in
indian
country,
and
anyone
can
buy
under
this
statute,
assuming
that
the
sale
is
in
conformity
with
tribal
and
state
laws.
california
has
also
declared
that
its
licensing
system
involves
in
the
highest
degree...
and
i
am
reading
from
the
words
of
the
statute...
in
the
highest
degree
the
economic,
social
and
moral
well-being
and
safety
of
the
state
and
all
of
its
people.
in
light
of
what
california
believes,
i
wonder
how
the
court
of
appeals
can
say
that
a
licensing
system
is
something
that
can
be
ignored.
it
is
an
important
aspect
of
california's
regulatory
system
of
liquor
traffic,
and
i
think
it
is
quite
important
for
the
state
to
be
able
to
impose
its
licensing
system.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
eventually
what
the
court
said.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
the
court
analyzed...
i
am
not
sure
how
the
court
analyzed
the
statute.
i
would
like
to
make
an
observation.
the
court
analyzed
the
words
of
the
statute
in
the
beginning
of
the
opinion.
in
none
of
the
briefs
cited
by...
none
of
the
briefs
submitted
by
respondent,
or
the
united
states
or
any
other
amici
have
that
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
words
of
the
statute
have
been
adopted,
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
so
because
the
court
of
appeals'
reading
of
the
statute
was
not
understandable.
i
have
read
that
opinion
many
times.
i
do
not
understand
how
the
court
can
arrive
at
the
conclusions
it
did
based
upon
the
wording
of
the
statute.
the
court
then
drew
a
distinction
between
licensing
and
substantive
state
standards,
but
the
court
nowhere
defined
the
phrase
substantive
state
standards.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
there
are
many
substantive
state
standards,
basic
policies,
as
respondent
put
it
in
her
brief.
there
are
many
basic
policies
which
are
contained
in
the
licensing
system
and
are
not
simply
criminal
statutes.
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
that
the
entire
state
regulatory
system
and
not
simply
what
are
called
state
substantive
standards
without
definition
are
to
be
followed
in
indian
country.
if
i
can
give
some
examples...
perhaps
the
most
important
policy
with
respect
to
retail
sales
of
liquor
in
california
is
the
proposition
that
there
should
not
be
a
liquor
store
or
bar
on
every
corner.
california
tries
to
limit
the
number
of
people
who
are
engaged
in
the
sale
of
distilled
spirits.
california
does
that
in
a
number
of
ways.
it
limits
the
number
of
licensees,
the
number
of
people
who
may
be
engaged
in
the
liquor
traffic.
that
is
based
on
population.
another
way
is
for
the
department...
the
department
is
given
the
authority
to
determine
if
a
particular
location
is
the
proper
location
for
a
retail
liquor
establishment.
the
department
is
specifically
given
the
authority--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--i
do
not
see
why
not,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
the
department
maintains
offices
throughout
california.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
the
department
has
investigators,
and
the
department's
investigators--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--there
is
nothing
in
the
statutes
which
would
prohibit
an
indian
from
being
an
investigator.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
i
do
not
know
if
any
of
the
employees
are
indians--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--pardon
me?
mr.
alan
s.
meth
i
do
not
know
that,
your
honor.
there
would
be
nothing
in
the
statutes
which
would
prohibit
the
department
from
hiring
indians.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
certainly
correct,
your
honor.
they
have
other
agencies
of
the
state
which
would
prohibit
that
sort
of
activity,
and
california
as
an
employer
has
traditionally
been
one
which
has
hired
all
kinds
of--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
your
honor,
there
are
75
to
80
reservations
in
the
state
of
california.
i
do
not
know
where
the
locations
of
the
churches
are.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
an
investigator
can
drive
up
to
a
reservation
and
determine
if
the
proposed
license
is
to
be--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--for
the
people
of
the
state
of
california,
not
just
the
indians.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
correct,
agua
caliente
being
a
prime
example.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
i
do
not
know
where
the
agua
calientes
are
getting
their
liquor.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
correct.
so,
that
would
eliminate
one
of
the
enforcement
methods
that
california
has
for
preventing
the
unlawful
sales
by
non-licensees.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
correct.
sales
cannot
be
between
2
a.m.
and
6
a.m.--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--and,
to
just
follow
that
up
for
a
moment,
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
it
makes
much
sense
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
hours
of
operation
in
which
respondent
and
the
united
states
seem
to
say
are
ones
which
california
may
regulate
and
the
location
of
a
liquor
store
or
a
bar.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
access
to
liquor.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
no,
they
are
saying
that
it
is
a
federal
offense--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--not
in
the
licensing
scheme,
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
well,
the--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--they
are
conceding
that
under
1161--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--a
federal
crime.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
correct.
however,
california
could
enforce
those
laws
under
public
law
280,
but
as
i
said
before,
public
law
280
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
and,
california's
authority
under
public
law
280
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
only
its
licensing
scheme.
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time--
mr.
alan
s.
meth
--certainly.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
it
was
not
argued
by
california
in
the
district
court.
when
respondent
filed
her
opening
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
she
raised
the
21st
amendment.
we
did
not...
california
did
not
respond
to
the
21st
amendment
argument.
however,
when
the
case
was
consolidated
with
washington's
case,
the
washington
attorney
general
advocated
the
21st
amendment
issue,
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
did
dispose
of
the
21st
amendment
issue.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
yes,
that
is
california's
position,
your
honor,
based
on
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
mr.
alan
s.
meth
that
is
correct.
i
think
it
is
reasonably
clear
from
section
1161
that
a
state
has
the,
what
mr.
schwartz
called
the
remarkably
intrusive
authority
of
telling
an
indian
reservation
that
it
cannot
sell
liquor
at
all.
the
way
that
a
state
has
that
authority
is
by
making
the
entire
state
dry.
in
1953,
there
were
two
states
that
were
actually
dry,
mississippi
and
oklahoma.
the
court
on
a
number
of
occasions
has
said
that
if
a
governmental
entity
has
a
greater
power,
it
also
has
all
of
the
lesser
powers
included
within
that
greater
power.
two
early
21st
amendment
cases,
ziffrin,
inc.
v.
reeves
and
state
board
of
equalization
v.
young's
market
co.
cited
in
our
briefs
indicate
that
a
state
has
the
authority
under
the
21st
amendment
to
totally
prohibit
the
introduction
of
liquor
within
the
state,
and
if
a
state
has
that
authority
it
has
the
authority
to
strictly
control
how
liquor
is
to
be
distributed
within
the
state.
another
case,
a
recent
indian
case,
merrion
v.
jicarilla
apache
tribe...
and
i
hope
i
pronounced
it
correctly...
the
court
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
a
tribe
could
exclude
nonmembers,
and
the
court
said
that
the
power
to
exclude
nonmembers
from
the
reservation
included
the
power
to
condition
entry
onto
reservation
land,
to
condition
the
continued
presence
on
indian
land,
and
also
condition
reservation
conduct.
if
a
state
has
the
greater
power
to
totally
prohibit
liquor
within
indian
country,
i
do
not
understand
why
the
distinction
has
to
be
drawn
that
some
laws,
lesser
laws
should
be
followed
but
other
lesser
laws
should
not
be
followed.
if
a
state
under
section
1161
has
the
greater
power,
it
should
also
have
the
lesser
power.
in
summary,
california
is
only
asserting
that
it
has
concurrent
authority
with
the
tribes
and
with
the
united
states
to
control
liquor
traffic
in
indian
country.
we
are
not
asserting
that
because
of
california's
licensing
laws.
those
laws
are
exclusive.
section
1161
gives
the
united
states
the
authority
to
criminally
prosecute.
section
1161
also
gives
certain
responsibilities
to
the
state...
to
the
tribes,
and
if
the
powers
to
the
tribe
include
the
power
to
license,
all
california
is
saying
that
that
statute
with
the
words
both
and
the
words
in
conformity
with,
and
the
words
laws
of
the
state
includes
the
same
powers
to
the
state.
