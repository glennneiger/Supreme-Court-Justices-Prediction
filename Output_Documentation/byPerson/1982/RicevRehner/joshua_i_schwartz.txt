mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
mr.
justice
powell,
i
think
it
may,
but
perhaps
we
better
be
crystal
clear
about
our
terms
here.
i
am
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
regulate.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
state
laws
on
that
subject
do
determine
the
terms,
in
our
view,
as
to
which--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--well,
as
we
understand
it,
we
would
suggest
that
certain
state
laws
which
do
not
have
any
licensing
related
terms
that
say
in
the
absolute,
no
person
may
sell
alcohol
to
a
minor,
or
give
alcohol
to
a
minor
at
certain
hours
are
pure
criminal
statutes
and
are
not
the
kind
of
essentially
a
subterfuge--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--our
view
is
that
the
state
lacks
licensing
authority
so
that
a
pure
criminal
violation
would
in
california
because
it
is
a
public
law
280
state
could
actually
be
prosecuted
by
the
state.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
under
state
law.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i
may
to
some
extent.
what
the--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--it
is
the
government's
view--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--if
i
may,
mr.
justice
white--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--there
are...
section
1161
and
public
law
280
were
passed
on
the
same
day
by
congress.
they
do
have
a
common
background,
and
it
is
necessary
to
sort
out
a
sensible
in
pari
materia
construction
of
the
two.
we
would
submit
that
a
state
may
not,
given
that
background,
pass
a
statute,
as
california,
in
fact,
has,
that
says
it
is
a
misdemeanor
to
sell
liquor
without
one
of
our
licenses
because
that
would
totally
frustrate
the
sense
of
section
1161,
even
though
that
is
on
its
face
a
criminal
violation.
i
take
it
that
was
what
fueled
justice
o'connor's
question.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
our
sense
that
some
criminal
violations
which
are
written
in
the
absolute
and
they
are
not
tied
to
the
requirement
of
a
license
may
fairly
be
regarded
as
distinct
and
true
criminal
proscriptions
and
that
those
may
be
enforced
by
the
state.
if
that
is
in
conflict
with
private
counsel's
answer,
so
be
it,
justice
white.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i
would
think
that
it
could.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
pursuant
to
public
law
280,
justice
marshall,
because
california
is
a
public
law
280
state
and
does
have
some
jurisdiction
which
permeates
the
reservation,
that
is
not
resting
on
the
statute
which
is
the
focus
of
this
case.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
that
would
be
our
understanding.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
well,
one
line
that
we
would
clearly
draw
is
that
no
proscription
which
is
tied
by
the
state
in
its
own
scheme
to
possession
of
a
license
may
be
enforced
in
that
manner
because
that
must
be
regarded
as
part
of
the
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
mr.
justice
marshall--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--let
me
try
this
and
see
if
this
will
answer
your
question.
our
view
is
not
that
the
distinction
depends
on
whether
something
is
embodied
in
a
regulation
or
a
state
statute.
let
us
be
clear
about
that.
we
suppose
that
for
purposes
of
section
1161
if
the
state
of
california
delegates
to
an
administrative
agency
the
authority
to
enact
a
regulation
proscribing
terms
of
conduct
in
general
terms
not
depending
on
whether
or
not
you
hold
one
of
their
licenses
or
not,
that
that
is
part
of
the
state
law.
if
that
state
law
is
criminal,
then
california
being
a
public
law
280
state
it
may
be
enforced.
but,
whether
or
not
the
state
is
a
public
law
280
state
because
it
is
part
of
the
terms
of
state
law
which
must
be
conformed
to,
the
federal
sanction
does
apply.
if
i
have
not
helped
you,
come
back
at
me.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
the
answer
is
in
part
that
public
law
280,
which
stands
outside
this
case,
says
that
the
state
shall
have
certain
criminal
jurisdiction.
now,
the
state
as...
california
has
a
system
whereby
certain
acts
are
proscribed
only
through
the
licensing
scheme,
but
should
the
state
wish
to,
proscribe
those
acts
in
general
terms,
those
would
be
incorporated
within
the
section
1161
structure.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i
think
we
would
say
not
because
the
sanction
is
license
revocation
but
the
same
regulation
could
be
written
a
different
way
to
accomplish
the
same
effect.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
no,
justice
stevens...
in
an
indirect
sense
we
do.
what
our
contention
is
that
section
1161
does
not
authorize
the
state
to
regulate
through
licensure.
that
means
it
cannot
do
any
of
these
things
indirectly
through
licensure.
if
it
wishes
to
enact
laws--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--the
answer
is
whether
that
plain
rule
is
a
rule
that
says,
our
licensees
may
not
permit
such
conduct
or
whether,
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--in
conformity
with
state
law,
we
understand
to
mean--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--if
you
will,
justice
stevens,
but
the
point
is
that
licensing
is
a
very
different
kind
of
authority
to
exercise
and
that
the
state
can
accomplish
the
same
objective
through
enacting
general
purpose
standards.
what
is
offensive,
if
i
may,
about
the
licensing,
regulatory
authority
that
the
state
claims,
is
its
discretionary
element,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
a
tax
is
being
imposed.
the
substantial
fee
is
exacted
before
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business
on
the
reservation.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
base
its
holding
on
it.
it
did
not
reject
it.
it
simply
did
not
rely
on
it.
what
we
would
lay
emphasis
on,
justice
o'connor,
is
the
discretionary
element.
it
is
important
to
understand
that
in
operating
a
licensing
scheme
the
state
does
not
disavow
the
full
range
of
discretionary
powers
that
exist
under
a
licensing
scheme.
it
is
useful
to
actually
look
at
the
california
statutes
and
see
what
may
happen.
for
instance,
when
one
applies
for
an
alcoholic
beverage
control
department
license
the
duty
of
the
department
is
to
determine
whether
the
licensee
is
qualified.
among
the
things
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
are
the
results
of
an
investigation.
the
department
is
enjoined
to
investigate
all
matters
affecting
the
public
welfare
or
morals,
and
it
has
been
held
under
california
law
that
a
license
may
be
denied
on
the
basis
of
a
determination
respecting
these
considerations.
the
statute
also
incorporates
other
relatively
vague
criteria.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yes,
justice
stevens,
and
i
would
draw
an
analogy
here
to
the
court's
decision
in
the
grendel's
den
case.
if
a
state
chooses
to
make
its
criteria
unconditional
then
those
criteria
come
outside
the
realm
of
discretionary
administration
and
then
they
are
part
of
the
laws
of
the
state
for
purposes
of
section
1161.
if
the
state
makes
the
choice
to
insist
on
retaining
discretion
to
sort
these
factors
out
for
itself
then
the
consequence
under
section
1161
is
that
that
is
not
part
of
the
law
of
the
state.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
justice
stevens,
if
i
may,
a
one
sentence
answer...
the
key
thing
in
our
view
is
that
there
is
no
support
for
the
rather
remarkably
intrusive
authority
that
the
state
does
claim.
the
more
modest
authority
that
we
would
accord
the
state
is
consistent
with
a
traditional
pattern.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yes,
but
i
think
it
is
common
ground
here
that
those
who
live
on
indian
reservations
may
not
in
general
be
treated
the
same
way
absent
federal
authority,
and
that
is
why
we
draw
that
distinction.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
we
think
that...
an
argument
that
the
state
has
no
authority
whatsoever
because
of
the
federal
indian
trader
statutes
would
be
difficult
to
reconcile
with
the
fact
that
congress
does
appear
to
have
recognized
some
role
for
the
states
in
section
1161.
this
distinction,
perhaps
not
totally
satisfactory
and
certainly
not
lucidly
clear,
is
the
best
way
we
can
find
to
draw
some
line
in
an
area
where
it
appears
that
some
line
must
be
drawn.
thank
you.
