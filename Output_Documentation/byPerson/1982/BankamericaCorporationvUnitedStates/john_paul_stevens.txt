well,
mr.
kneedler,
apart
from
the
antitrust
laws,
is
there
any
risk
that
if
it
were
decided
that
all
these
directors
had
been
acting
unlawfully
in
serving
as
directors,
that
some
of
their
corporate
acts
might
be
subject
to
challenge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
be
a
question
of
state
law,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you...
you're
sure
they're
perfectly
safe?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
get
to
that,
do
you
think...
do
you
think
there
is
any
merit
to
mr.
simon's
argument
that
this
really
isn't
an
exemption,
it's
a
question
of
how
you
define
the
offense,
because
if
you
said
all
corporations
except
banks
in
the
first
clause,
that
wouldn't
be
an
exemption,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
quite
different
from
a
separate
statutory
enactment,
like
an
exemption
from
the...
for
labor
or
an
exemption
for
the
insurance
industry,
the
mccarran
act
or
something
of
that
kind,
isn't
it?
