william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
mean
uninterpreted
or
uninterrupted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
simon,
was
this
debate
argument
that
you
are
now
presenting
also
presented
at
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
didn't
lose
faith
in
it
because
you
lost
there.
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
simon,
what
liability
does
an
interlocking
director
subject
himself
to
by
remaining
on
a
board
if
the
government
is
correct
in
its--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
doesn't
that
detract
from
your
argument
of
60
years
of
no
prosecution
or
no
construction
by
the
government?
if
the
government
really
can't
do
anything
anyway
except
voluntary,
try
to
get
voluntary
compliance,
it
seems
to
me
it
negates
all
but
the
administrative
interpretation
argument.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
it,
a
declaratory
judgment,
is
it,
or--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--injunction--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
much
weight
does
that
really
bear
in
a
closed
case,
mr.
kneedler?
i
mean
if
you
applied
that
generally,
i
suppose
you'd
say
anytime
there
is
an
arguable
point
to
be
made
for
the
government,
the
courts
ought
to
decide
in
favor
of
the
government.
i...
i
don't
see
that
carries
a
lot
of
weight
in
a
case
like
this.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
know
when
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
was
created?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what,
just
by
hypothesis,
if
a
treble
damage
plaintiff
alleged
that
the
defendant
took
an
action
and
that
there
were
10
out
of
the
30
directors
were
interlocking
directors
that
were
barred
by
the
thing
and
if
they
hadn't
voted
in
favor
of
the
resolution,
it
wouldn't
be
carried,
and
this
resolution
was
what
led
to
the
policy
that
is
injured.
don't
you
think
that
would
have
some
possibility
of
saving
a
claim
in
antitrust
violation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
by
itself
couldn't
constitute
the
antitrust
violation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
provide
for
all
deliberate
speed?
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
you
say
that
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
language
and
the
structure
of
the
act?
i
mean
don't
you
think
that
the
actual
interpretation
of
the
written
enacted
language
here
is
a
very
close
call?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why
wouldn't
you
put
some
reliance
on
this
sort
of
a
discussion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
congress
has
reconciled
those,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
want
to
rely
on
a
bunch
of
general
presumptions
and
not
address
what
congressmen
thought
about
this
particular
clause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there...
is
there
a
provision
in
the
antitrust
acts
that
says
they
shall
be
liberally
construed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where...
i...
you
say
the
presumption
of
liberal
construction
is
not
a
judge-made
rule?
