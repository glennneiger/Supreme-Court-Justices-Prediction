mr.
william
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
here
is
whether
section
8
of
the
1914
clayton
act,
which
bars
corporate
director
interlocks
between
two
or
more
corporations
other
than
banks,
applies
to
one
bank
and
one
non-bank;
namely,
one
bank
and
an
insurance
company.
the
appellants
here
are
four
insurance
companies,
three
banks,
three
bank
holding
companies,
and
three
individuals
who
were
directors
at
the
same
time
of
both
a
bank
and
an
insurance
company.
both
the
district
and
the
circuit
courts
found
that
40
percent
of
all
insurance
directors
in
america
were
also
directors
of
banks,
and
that
this
situation
had
prevailed
for
a
long
time,
and
yet
until
the
filing
of
this
case,
61
years
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
the
government
had
never
attacked
the
bank-insurance
interlock.
indeed,
the
amicus
brief
of
the
american
council
of
life
insurance
states
that
79
percent
of
their
insurance
company
members
have
one
or
more
bank
directors
on
their
board.
this
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
in
san
fransicso
before
chief
judge
peckham
on
a
fully
stipulated
record.
he
found
that
the
statute
did
not
apply
to
an
insurance-bank
interlock.
on
an
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
chief
judge
browning,
joined
in
by
senior
district
judge
christianson,
the
court
found
that
the
statute
did
bar
the
interlock
but
circuit
judge
kennedy
dissented.
thus,
one
district
judge
and
one
circuit
judge
has
held
the
act
inapplicable
to
this
interlock,
each
holding
that
the
statutory
language
was
clear
and
unequivocal
and
on
the
other
hand
one
circuit
judge
and
one
district
judge
has
held
that
the
act
is
applicable
conceding,
however,
and
i
quote,
"the
meaning
remains
equivocal"
and,
i
quote
again,
"the
language
may
be
read
with
equal
plausibility.
"
as
it
was
read
by
the
district
court.
judge
browning's
opinion
issued
34
months
after
the
oral
argument.
we
urge
affirmance
of
the
district
court
judgment
on
the
grounds,
first,
of
the
face
of
the
statute;
secondly,
if
your
honors
get
that
far,
the
clear
legislative
history;
and
finally,
60
years
of
uninterpreted
administrative
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
department
of
justice,
the
federal
trade
commission,
and
the
congress.
mr.
william
simon
both,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
submit,
is
clear,
and
it
appears
in
several
places
in
the
brief,
but
one
page
is
page
2
of
our
brief,
which
is
the
blue
brief.
and
the
statute
provides
as
follows:
no
person
at
the
same
time
shall
be
a
director,
one,
in
any
two
or
more
corporations;
two,
any
one
of
which
has
capital
in
surplus
of
a
million
dollars...
and
i
point
out
where
the
congress
meant
any
one
of
them;
it
said
any
one
of
them
has
capital
of
a
million
dollars;
three,
engaged
in
whole
or
in
part
in
commerce,
which
i
submit
means
two
or
more
corporations
engaged
in
whole
or
in
part
in
commerce;
and
four,
other
than
banks,
banking
associations,
trust
companies,
and
common
carriers
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act.
in
his
opinion
in
the
district
court
judge
peckham
said
of
that
language,
and
i
quote
from
his
opinion,
"an
examination
of
this
language
reveals
four
criteria
which
must
be
met
before
this
statute
may
be
applied:
first,
a
person
must
simultaneously
serve
as
a
director
of
two
or
more
competing
corporations;
second,
at
least
one
of
the
corporations
must
have
capital
surplus
and
undivided
profits
of
greater
than
a
million
dollars;
third,
both
or
all
of
the
corporations
must
be
engaged
in
interstate
commerce;
and
fourth,
the
corporations
must
be
other
than
banks,
banking
associations,
trust
companies,
or
common
carriers.
"
we
submit
that
two
corporations
other
than
banks
and
common
carriers
excludes
two
corporations,
one
of
which
is
a
bank
or
a
common
carrier.
there
are
three
different
provisions
relating
to
three
different
classes
of
corporations
in
this
statute
as
showing
that
congress
did
not
have
in
mind
a
uniform
legislative
purpose.
the
second
and
third
unnumbered
paragraphs
of
the
house
bill
relate
to
banks.
and
as
presently
amended,
they
apply
only
where
one
of
the
banks
is
a
member
of
the
federal
reserve
system
and
no
more
than
a
third
of
the
banks
in
the
country
are
members
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
and
it
includes
not
only
directors
but
officers
and
employees
as
to
which
interlocks
are
also
prohibited.
the
fourth...
excuse
me,
the
first
unnumbered
paragraph
of
the
house
bill,
which
is
now
section
10
of
the
clayton
act,
relates
to
common
carriers.
it
in
no
way
prohibits
interlocking
directorates
between
competing
common
carriers.
it
provides
only
that
when
there
is
an
interlocking
directorate
between
a
borrower
and
a
lender
or
a
supplier
and
a
purchaser,
that
the
transactions
must
be
on
public
bids.
and
then
the
fourth
unnumbered
paragraph
of
section
8
is
the
one
which
we
have
here
which
throughout
the
legislative
history
was
referred
to
as
the
industrial
corporations
act.
and
we
strongly
urge
that
one
bank
and
one
non-bank
doesn't
make
two
bank...
two
corporations
other
than
banks.
this
case
does
not
involve
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
with
the
accompanying
narrow
rules
of
construction.
this
is
not
a
case
like
the
norris-laguardia
act,
which
exempted
labor
unions
from
antitrust
laws,
or
the
capra-volstead
act,
which
exempted
farm
co-ops
from
antitrust
laws,
or
the
securities
act,
which
exempted
the
stock
exchange
from
the
antitrust
laws.
this
case
involves
a
requirement
of
the
statute
which
is
not
met
in
the
case
before
this
court.
now,
i
think
that
that
is
the
end
of
the
lawsuit,
but
i
do
think
if
the
court
goes
beyond
the
face
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
is
compelling,
and
i
would
like
to
speak
to
it
briefly.
mister...
later
justice...
brandeis
was
an
adviser
to
president
wilson
in
1914,
and
he
testified
before
the
house
judiciary
committee
on
this
legislation,
having
previously
written
a
long
series
of
articles
on
the
subject
matter
which
were
published
in
harpers.
the
pujo
committee
of
the
senate
had
conducted
hearings
on
this
subject,
and
its
general
counsel,
samuel
untermyer
testified
before
the
house
judiciary
committee
on
this
bill.
both
mr.
brandeis
and
mr.
untermyer
urged
upon
the
house
judiciary
committee
that
the
bill
should
cover
insurance-bank
interlocks.
and
they
said
it
doesn't
do
it
and
you
should
amend
the
bill
to
make
it
cover
it.
the
house
took
no
heed
of
their
admonition.
as
the
bill
passed
the
house,
the
second
and
third
unnumbered
paragraphs
related
to
banks,
the
fourth
unnumbered
paragraph
read
as
i
read
it
to
you
earlier
except
that
the
"other
than"
clause
read
merely
"other
than
common
carriers".
it
did
not
have
the
banks
in
it.
and
at
that
time,
the
first
paragraph
related
to
common
carriers
but,
as
i
noted,
only
borrowers
and
suppliers.
in
the
senate
the
senate
struck
all
banking
provisions
from
the
bill
so
that
as
it
passed
the
senate
the
banking
provisions
of
the
house
bill
were
eliminated.
when
it
got
to
conference,
the
house
conferees
insisted
on
putting
back
the
house
provisions
on
the
banking
provisions,
and
the
senate
conferees
ultimately
said,
okay,
we'll
put
the
house...
we'll
put
those
things
back,
but
we
want
to
put
in
between
"other
than
common
carriers"
the
words
"banks,
banking
associations,
and
trust
companies.
"
and
so
the
conference
committee
report
was
changed
to
read
"other
than
banks
and
common
carriers.
"
i
think
most
conclusive
on
the
legislative
history
is
the
fact
that
when
the
conference
committee
report
got
back
to
the
house,
congressman
mann
made
a
point
of
order
that
the
conferees
had
exceeded
their
jurisdiction
in
inserting
the
words
"banks"
between
"other
than"
and
"common
carriers".
he
opposed,
he
took
the
position
that
the
department
of
justice
takes
before
you
today,
and
he
said
that
the
conferees
had
gone
beyond
their
authority.
congressman
shirley
and
congressman
webb,
who
were
both
members
of
the
conference
committee,
agreed
with
him
that
the
bill
did
just
what
he
said
it
did,
but
they
argued
that
it
did
not
go
beyond
the
authority
of
the
conference
committee
because
they
merely
put
into
the
statute
in
explicit
terms
what
was
previously
implicit.
the
speaker,
who
was
then
champ
clark,
overruled
the
point
of
order,
and
the
bill
passed
in
that
manner.
because
we
think
the
debate
on
this
point
of
order
is
so
important
to
the
legislative
history,
we
have
copied
it
in
its
totality
in
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief.
and
i
would
like
to
read
two
sentences
of
congressman
mann,
from
a-2
of
the
yellow
brief.
just
before
the
quotation
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence,
he
says,
what
the
conferees
have
done
is
to
eliminate
from
this
section
all
banking
corporations.
and
then
skipping
to
the
last
five
lines
of
the
page,
he
says,
and
the
conferees
by
their
report
undertake
to
eliminate
from
this
prohibition
of
interlocking
directorates
not
only
the
railroads
subject
to
the
act
to
regulate
commerce
but
also
banks,
banking
institutions,
and
trust
companies.
and
we
indeed
agree
with
that
he...
with
what
he
said.
now,
on
page
14
congressman
shirley,
who
supported
the
conference
report,
said
in
a
sentence
beginning
about
two
inches
down
from
the
top
of
the
page,
the
conferees
having
redrafted
the
matter
have
gotten
away
from
the
language
of
section
9
of
the
house
and
section
7
of
the
senate...
and
what
is
now
section
8
was
9
in
the
house
and
7
in
the
senate...
in
many
particulars,
concluded
that
it
would
leave
no
matter
of
argument
touching
the
language
of
section
7
and
therefore
the
conferees
inserted
in
the
exclusion
proviso
what
would
have
been
held
as
excluded
in
the
bill
agreed
to
in
the
conference
even
if
not
put
there,
to
wit,
banks,
banking
associations,
and
trust
companies,
thus
making
it
plain
by
the
very
expression
itself
that
they...
and
i
believe
"they"
refers
back
to
the
banks...
that
they
along
with
the
common
carriers
were
not
within
the
group
outlined
as
industrial
corporations.
and
yet,
in
spite
of
both
sides
agreeing
that
that's
what
the
conference
report
did,
although
they
disagreed
on
the
propriety
of
doing
so,
the
court
of
appeals,
in
its
opinion
reversing
the
district
court,
said,
and
i
am
quoting
at
the
top
of
page
24-a
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition
for
certiorari,
in
the
first
full
sentence,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
but
the
references
in
the
exclusionary
clause
to
banks
and
common
carriers
do
not
have
a
common
origin.
there
is
no
basis
for
the
assumption
that
they
are
to
be
read
in
the
same
way.
and
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
hold
that
the
phrase
"other
than
banks"
was
to
be
read
"other
than
to
banks",
but
the
phrase
"other
than
common
carriers"
was
to
be
read
"other
than
one
common
carrier".
and
that's
exactly
opposite
to
what
both
sides
agreed
in
the
debate
on
the
point
of
order
to
the
conference
report.
mr.
william
simon
yes,
indeed.
i
made
the
argument
to
the
court
of
appeals,
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
said
exactly
to
them
what
i
have
said
to
you.
mr.
william
simon
since
1914
the
congress
has
repeatedly
modified
section
8.
the
banking
provisions,
for
example,
were
changed
five
times:
1916,
1920,
'28,
'29,
and
'35.
but
it
has
repeatedly
rejected
suggestions
made
to
it
that
it
amend
unnumbered
paragraph
4
to
cover
bank-insurance
interlocks.
mr.
william
simon
no,
your
honor.
the
colloquy
was
primarily
with
congressman
mann,
who
made
the
point
of
order,
and
congressman
webb
and
shirley,
who
opposed
it.
and
they
both
agreed
on
what
the
point...
what
the
language
would
do.
their
difference
was
that
congressman
mann
thought
it
was
a
bad
thing.
and
what
he
expressly
said
in
his
argument,
that
if
you
let
this
go
through,
it
will
permit
a
bank
and
united
states
steel
corporation
or
a
bank
and
the
sugar
trust
company
or
a
bank
and
a
hat
company
to
have
common
directors,
and
i
am
against
that.
and
congressmen
shirley
and
webb
didn't
disagree
with
him
on
what
it
did,
but
said
that
that
was
within
the
scope
of
the
conferees'
authority,
and
the
speaker
agreed
with
him.
mr.
william
simon
yes,
sir.
but
he
agreed
that
if
the
conferees'
language
stayed,
it
would
not
achieve
that
result.
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
his
point
of
order.
in
1965,
'67,
'69,
'71,
'74,
and
'75
bills
were
introduced
into
congress
that
would
have
prohibited
these
interlocks,
and
yet
not
one
of
those
bills
passed.
in
1978
congress
had
before
it
comprehensive
legislation
to
deal
with
interlocks
in
financial
institutions.
and
the
bill
that
finally
emerged
is
the
depository
institution
interlock
act
of
1978.
that
debate
took
place
shortly
after
judge
peckham's
decision
in
the
district
court.
and
congressman
st
germain
took
the
floor
of
the
house
and
castigated
judge
peckham
for
his
decision
in
this
case,
said
it
was
a
totally
wrong
decision
and
it
ought
to
be
reversed.
and
he
offered
an
amendment
which
would
have
reversed
judge
peckham's
decision.
the
amendment
was
stricken,
and
to
be
sure,
it
was
stricken
on
a
technicality,
but
a
technicality
which
could
have
been
cured
and
no
member
of
the
congress,
in
spite
of
congressman
st
germain's
criticism
of
this
case,
no
member
of
the
congress
offered
a
proper
amendment
which
would
have
overruled
the
decision.
i
submit
that
this
court's
decision
in
1980
in
merrill
lynch
versus
curran
and
in...
i
am
sorry,
that
was
in
1982...
and
in
1980
in
seatrain
versus
shell,
hold
that
while
the
views
of
subsequent
congresses
cannot
overrule
the
unmistakable
intent
of
the
enacting
congress,
they
are
entitled
to
great
weight
where
there
is
any
doubt
of
the
intent
of
the
enacting
congress.
now,
although
the
government
now
claims
that
the
statute
prohibits
these
interlocks,
they
concede
that
they
made
no
effort
for
over
60
years
to
enforce
it,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
40
percent
of
all
insurance
company
directors
in
america
were
bank
directors.
and
the
answer
they
give
you
in
their
brief
is
that
they
were
spending
their
time
on
voluntary
enforcement
and
they
were
trying
to
achieve
the
results
voluntarily.
now,
i
have
the
greatest
respect
for
the
department
of
justice,
and
i
think
if
they
were
really
were
trying
to
get
voluntary
enforcement
of
the
statute,
there
would
not
have
been
40
percent
of
all
insurance
company
directors
on
bank
boards
at
the
time
this
case
was
filed.
i
suggest
that
they
do
not
cite
a
single
instance
where
they
persuaded
an
insurance
or
bank
director
to
voluntarily
give
up
one
of
his
directorships.
and
we
know
of
none.
i
also
suggest
that
a
more
likely
answer
to
that
situation
is
the
holding
of
this
court
in
1949
in
the
panhandle
case
where
it
held
that
the
failure
to
use
such
an
important
power
for
so
long
a
time
indicates
a
belief
that
the
power
did
not
exist.
mr.
william
simon
none
whatever,
justice
rehnquist.
no
liability
at
all.
i
might
add,
in
addition,
that
even
if
we
are...
if
we
are
correct
and
we
are
sustained
by
this
court,
they
also
have
no
immunity
from
violating
the
antitrust
laws.
if
a
bank
director
and
an
insurance
company
director
sitting
on
a
board
conspire
to
do
something
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
they
are
just
as
subject
to
being
indicted
as
anybody
else.
mr.
william
simon
oh,
justice
rehnquist,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
where
both
the
justice
department
and
the
federal
trade
commission
have
sued
to
force
somebody
off
a
board.
when
i
say
a
number
of
cases,
i
don't
mean
thousands,
but
there
are
a
great
many
cases.
mr.
william
simon
no,
sir,
it's
just
a
suit
for
an
injunction
to
enjoin--
mr.
william
simon
--the
man
from
serving
on
both
boards.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
the
law
at
least
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
justice
stevens
that
either
of
the
corporations
can
sue
to
get
off
their
board
a
man
who
is
not
legally
sitting
on...
who
is
illegally
sitting
on
two
boards
in
violation
of
section
8.
now,
that
case
didn't
involve
banking
interlock,
but
you
sue
for
an
injunction
to
enjoin
the
man
from
sitting
on
the
board.
fifteen
months
before
this
case
was
filed,
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice,
who
filed
this
case,
made
a
public
statement
in
which
he
said,
and
i
quote,
"the
clayton
act
section
dealing
with
interlocks
may
not
be
directly
applicable
to
financial
institutions
and
insurance
companies.
"
and
he
added,
"it
may
be
more
of
a
legislative
problem
than
an
enforcement
problem.
"
in
1950
a
report
of
the
federal
trade
commission
said
flatly
that
this
statute
did
not
bar
bank-insurance
company
interlocks.
and
25
years
later,
in
1974,
the
chairman
of
the
federal
trade
commission
testified
before
congress
that
the
deficiencies
pointed
out
in
their
1950
report
still
prevail.
in
1965
a
staff
report
of
the
house
judiciary
committee,
and
in
1968
a
staff
report
of
the
house
banking
committee
both
alluded
to
the
fact
that
these
interlocks
were
not
covered.
and
i
think
that's
particularly
significant
in
light
of
the
bills
that
i
referred
to
earlier
in
this
time
frame
where
congress
refused
to
enact
legislation
that
would
have
barred
these
interlocks.
one
final
minor
point.
the
complaint
is
brought
against
both
the
banks
and
their
holding
companies.
the
case
was
tried
on
a
stipulation
of
facts.
the
stipulation
has
in
paragraph
9
two
sentences,
one
of
which
we
rely
on
and
one
on
which
the
government
relies
on.
the
sentence
the
government
relies
on
provides
that
the
holding
companies
admit
control
of
the
bank
through
ownership
of
the
stock
and
the
election
of
directors.
and
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
makes
the
holding
company
responsible
for
the
acts
of
the
bank
and
therefore,
if
the
bank
is
guilty,
the
holding
company
is
guilty.
but
the
second
sentence
of
that
very
same
paragraph
says
that
the
directors
of
the
bank,
and
i
quote,
"manage
the
bank
and
select
the
officers
and
control
its
operations
and
activities.
"
now,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized,
and
i
think
it's
hornbook
law
that
a
parent
is
not
liable
for
the
acts
of
its
subsidiaries
unless
it
actually
operates
the
subsidiary
company.
and
while
recognizing
that
law,
the
court
of
appeals
ignored
it
by
holding
the
holding
companies
liable
here.
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
saying
that
we
believe
the
unambiguous
language
of
the
statute,
the
concession
by
both
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
cannot
prevail
without
giving
the
words
60
years
to
bring
a
case
in
this
area,
although
it
had
knowledge
that
40
percent
of
insurance
company
directors
were
bank
directors.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
william
simon
i
have
just
one
comment,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
that
is
that
our
primary
argument
is
that
the
statutory
words
"two
or
more
corporations
other
than
banks.
"
does
not
include
one
bank
and
one
non-bank.
thank
you.
