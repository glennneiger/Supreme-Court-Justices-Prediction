we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
bank
america
corporation
against
the
united
states.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
exchange,
mr.
simon,
did
any
member
advance
or
advocate
the
position
now
asserted
by
the
government
in
this
colloquy
that
was
going
on
in
these
exchanges?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
mr.
mann
wanted
to
alter
it
to
provide
what
the
government
now
contends
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
simon.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
seems
to
me
justice
rehnquist's
point
is
especially
significant
when,
what
is
it,
60
years
has
gone
by
with
one
position
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
this
area
and
now
the
government
changes
its
position.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
wasn't
referring
to
affirmative
statements,
i
was
talking
about
passivity,
nonaction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
situation
you
are
talking
about,
you
are
dealing
with
a
new
and
what
was
then
regarded
as
a
revolutionary
concept
of
law.
and
there's
nothing
new
or
revolutionary
about
the
antitrust
laws
now,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we've
all
had
60
years
to
think
about
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
60
years
in
this
context.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
standing
committee
of
either
house
or
of
both
houses
on
focusing
directly
on
antitrust
matters,
or
a
subcommittee
of--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--it
would
be
a
subcommittee
of
the
judiciary,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
i
recall
20
or
30
years
ago
senator
o'mahoney
was
chairman
of
that
subcommittee
and
was
very
active
in
surveillance
of
problems
of
this
kind.
was
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
mean
generally
oversight
of
the--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--antitrust
laws.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
position,
or
to
put
it
this
way,
does
your
position
assume
that,
going
back
to,
let's
say,
50
years
ago
when
senator
robinson
of,
i
think,
arkansas
and
wright
patman
of
texas,
and
o'mahoney
and
norris
of
nebraska
were
all
very
active
in
this
surveillance
of
antitrust
laws.
and
there
were
many
others
too.
but
did
all
this
escape
their
notice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
these
interlocking
directorates
escaped
their
notice
all
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
they
must
have
been
all
pretty
well
aware
of
congressman
mann's
position.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
possible
that,
to
take
the
more
recent
one,
senator
o'mahoney's
subcommittee
on
antimonopolies
and
some
other...
and
the
broad
range,
that
those
men
who
were
acutely
familiar
with
these
fields
were
not
conscious
that
there
were
thousands
of
interlocking
directorates
of
banks
and
other
companies?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
it
says--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
simon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
