mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
background
of
the
enactment
of
the
clayton
act.
that
statute
was
passed
in
1914
to
supplement
the
sherman
act
and
to
correct
perceived
deficiencies
in
the
sherman
act.
it
was
intended
to
arrest
in
their
incipiency
conspiracies
and
monopolies
and
trusts
that
would
be
anticompetitive
and
to
arrest
them
before
their
consummation.
section
8
of
the
clayton
act,
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
part
of
that
overall
statutory
scheme.
its
prohibition
against
interlocking
directorates
between
competing
corporations
is
likewise
intended
to
arrest
anticompetitive
conduct
in
its
incipiency.
congress
was
aroused
by
the
fact
that
concentration
of
control
by
a
few
individuals
over
the
great
corporations
of
the...
of
the
country
may
have
led
to
anticompetitive
situations
among
corporations
that
should
have
been
in
unrestrained
and
active
competition.
congress
feared
that
the
interlocking
directorates
would
lead
to
uniform
policies
among
those
corporations
that
should
have
been
competing
and
that
they
may
have
led
to
joint
action
against
third
parties.
congress
was
also
specifically
concerned
about
the
concentration
of
control
over
capital.
section
8,
therefore,
was
designed
to
nip
in
the
bud
the
possible
antitrust
violations
that
could
arise
in
this
setting.
now,
as
the
committee
reports
on
the
bill
explain,
congress
emphatically
rejected
the
suggestion
that
there
were
not
enough
men
in
the
country
qualified
to
serve
on
the
boards
of
directors
of
the
great
corporations
and
that
these
interlocking
directors
should
be
permitted
to
continue
for
that
reason.
to
the
contrary,
congress
concluded
following
on
the
views
of
the
president,
that
the
implementation
of
section
8
would
in
fact
bring
new
people
into
the
boards
and
would
bring
new
initiatives
and
new
ideas.
and
congress
concluded
that
the
notion
that
there
are
not
enough
people
to
go
around
on
the
boards
of
directors
was
contrary
to
our
institutions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's...
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
this
case,
the
petitioners,
as
counsel
has
indicated,
stipulated
that
the
banks
and
insurance
companies
involved
in
this
case
are
corporations
engaged
in
commerce
and
that
they
are
competitors,
principally,
in
the
extension
of
real
estate
and
mortgage
loans.
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
the
substantiality
of
the
potential
competition
perhaps
affected
by
this
case
is
indicated
by
stipulations
that
in
1975
the
three
banks
had
outstanding
real
estate
loans
of
about
$6
billion
and
the
insurance
companies
involved
had
outstanding
real
estate
loans
of
about
$32
billion.
indeed,
petitioners
have
stipulated
in
this
case
that
the
competition
between
the
banks
and
insurance
companies
is
not
insubstantial
and
that
they
have
in
effect
admitted
for
purposes
of
this
litigation
that
an
agreement
between
them
to
eliminate...
to
eliminate
that
competition
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
as
that
principle
is
used
in
section
8.
now,
those...
although
these
prerequisites
for
the
application
of
paragraph
4
of
section
8
are
satisfied
in
this
case,
petitioners
nevertheless
contend
that
they...
that
the
interlocks
between
banks
and
insurance
companies
are
exempt
from
the
coverage
of
paragraph
4.
they
rely
on
the
phrase
in
that
paragraph
"other
than
banks,
banking
associations,
and
trust
companies.
"
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
this
phrase,
which
makes
no
mention
of
the
insurance
companies
that
petitioners
claim
are
exempt
by
virtue
of
their
interlock
with
the
banks,
whether
this
phrase
should
be
construed
to
be
limited
to
the
banking
institutions
that
are
expressly
mentioned
in
that
phrase
or
whether
it
should
be
construed
more
broadly
to
exempt
from
coverage
interlocks
between
a
bank
and
insurance
company.
now,
the
statutory
presumptions
governing
the
recognition
of
exemptions
from
the
antitrust
laws
are
well
established
under
this
court'
decisions.
we
think
that
there
are
three
principles
that
are
especially
pertinent
here.
first
is
the...
is
the
basic
one,
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
to
be
liberally
construed
and
correspondingly
that
exemptions
from
those
laws
are
to
be
narrowly
construed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
this
court
has
treated
it
as
a
starting
point
of
analysis,
and
that's
the...
that's
the
point
that
i
am
making
here.
and
also
that
the
court
has
viewed
those
principles
as
applying
equally
where
there
is
an
express
exemption
as
we
have
here
as
well
as
where
there
is
an
implied
exemption.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
would
like
to
address
that
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
fact,
petitioners
point
to
no
statement
by
the
justice
department
which
has
dual
enforcement
authority
with
the...
with
the
federal
trade
commission
during
this...
during
this
period,
expressing
the
view
that
bank-non-bank
interlocks
are
not
covered
by
the
fourth
paragraph
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
as
this
court
noted
in
the
w.t.
grant
case,
which
is
the
previous
case
it's
had
before
it
under
section
8,
the
government
in
the...
in
the
decades
immediately
following
the
clayton
act
did
not
pursue
enforcement,
unfortunately,
perhaps,
in
any
area
of
section
8.
so
these...
failure
of
the
justice
department
to
focus
specifically
on
this
type
of
interlock,
when
read
in
that
context
of
general
absence
of
enforcement,
we
think
doesn't
really...
doesn't
really
prove
very
much.
in
fact--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
that's...
that...
that's
correct.
and
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
as
i
say--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the...
as
i
say,
the...
there
was
not
enforcement
action
under...
under
most
circumstances
under
the
clayton
act.
in
fact,
the
1965
staff
report
that
is
cited
in
the
briefs
has
statistics
on
the
enforcement
both
by
the
federal
trade
commission
and
by
the
justice
department,
at
page
227,
in
which
that
indicates
that
there
was
no
systematic
enforcement
program
by
the
justice
department
at
all
until
after
world
war
ii.
and
in
fact,
the
first
suit
that
eventually
went
to
a
judgment
in
one
of
these
cases
was
not
even
filed
until
1952.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
respective
judiciary
committees
would--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
ordinarily,
the
antitrust--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't
know
specifically
on
this.
there--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
i...
yes,
i
think
the
antitrust--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--committees
do.
but
i
think
again,
even
as...
even
as
to
that,
these...
the
'65
staff
committee
print
that's
referred
to
in
the
briefs
makes
the
point
that
the...
that
the
department
and
the
federal
trade
commission
had
generally
not
enforced
the
statutes.
so
that
any
dissatisfaction
that
congress
may
have
felt,
and
it's
unclear
to
what
extent
congress
was
dissatisfied,
seems
to
have
been
more
generally
focused
on
the
general
nonenforcement
of
section
8
than
perhaps
on
this
particular...
particular
point.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not,
justice
rehnquist.
i
would
point
out
too
that
the
situation
we
have
here
is
not
unlike
that
before
the
court
in
the
dupont
case,
which
involved
the
question
of
whether
vertical
acquisitions
are
covered
by
section
7.
in
that
case
the
court
pointed
out
that
there
likewise
had
been
a
period
of
35
years
of
nonenforcement
against
vertical
mergers.
and
also
the
federal
trade
commission
in
fact
had
gone
on
record
as
saying
that
the
vertical
acquisitions
were
not
covered,
and
yet
the
court
construed
the
section
7
as
applicable
in
that
circumstance.
and
likewise
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
the
court
noted
that
the
justice
department
had...
itself
had
expressed
doubt
after
the...
even
after
the
passage
of
the
1950
amendments
that
the
particular
form
of
acquisition
or
merger
in
that
case
was
not
covered.
and
yet
that
did
not
deter
the
court.
so
in
the
absence
of
some
more
affirmative
showing
of
a
contemporaneous
judgment
that
these,
interlocks
such
as
this,
were
not
intended
to
be
reached
by
congress,
we
think
that
the
absence
of
that
is
not
controlling.
and
i
think
that
i
would
also
like
to
underscore
the
point
that
justice
rehnquist
made.
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
government
is
coming
in
in
a
situation
that
would
expose
the
individual
directors
to
criminal
liability.
criminal
penalties
for
stopped...
were
deleted
from
the
bill.
it's
not
a
situation
that
would
require
a
disruption
of
the
ongoing
operations
of
a
company.
this
isn't
a
case
where
the
remedy
is
one
of
divestiture
or
something
of
that
sort.
this
is
not
a
case
that...
a
situation
in
which
the
interlocking
directorate
would
pose
any
realistic
possibility
of
treble
damages,
because
the
interlocking
directorate
provision
was
really
prophylactic
in
nature,
and
absent
some
additional
abuse,
the...
an
individual
challenging
it
would
probably
not
be
able
to
demonstrate
injury.
i
would
also
point
out
again
that
what
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
conceivably,
although...
although
we
were...
it's
our
view
that
in
almost
every
such
situation
there
would
be...
it...
there
would
be...
or
it
would
be
necessary
to
prove
an
independent
violation.
in
other
words,
a
conspiracy
with
another...
with
another
corporation
or--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't
want
to
rule
it
out
entirely,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
not,
because
the
interlock
itself
does...
is
not
an
active
sort
of
thing
that
injures
someone
else.
it's
when
the
interlock
is
abused
in
the
way
that
congress
was
concerned
about,
and
that
congress
thought
the
abuses
were
already
covered
but
it
was
necessary
to...
to
have
the
prophylactic
measure
in
order
to
prevent
any
temptation
or
opportunity
for
it
to
happen.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
would
think
not.
i
would
think
that
the
principle
of
de
facto--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i...
i
should
think
so.
but
i
would
think
in
this
setting--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i--
[laughter]
i
don't
want
to
warrant
it,
but
i--
--i
would
assume
so.
i...
one
other
point
just
to
finish
up
on
this
analysis,
and
that
is
that
the...
the
remedy
here,
to
the
extent
that
an
insurance
company
or
bank
may
feel
that
if
there
are
several
insurance
company-bank
directors
on
the
board,
that
this
might
be
unsettling
for
the
board,
an
appropriate
remedy
could
be
fashioned
to
make
sure
that
the
respective
boards
did
not
have
to
rid
themselves
of
the
directors
immediately
upon
the
entry
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--something
along
those
lines,
as
the...
as
the
court...
as
the
court's
decision
last
term
in
romero
barcello,
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
case,
that
indicated
that
the...
an
appropriate
solution
could
be
an
injunction
ordering
the...
the
parties
to
come
into
compliance.
and
we
would
think
that,
as
there,
a
reasonable
compliance
period
would
be
appropriate.
and
that
remedy
in
fact
would
be
simply
a
turnover
of
the
board,
which
is
something
that
happens
in
the
normal
course
anyway
through
elections
or
resignations.
so
just
in
order
to
put
this
in
perspective,
i
think
it's
necessary
to
focus
on
what
the
remedy
would
be.
and
even
though
counsel
cites
statistics
regarding
the
number
of
bank
directors
on
boards
of
insurance
companies,
it
should
be
pointed
out
as
well
that
that
does
not
indicate
how
many
of
those
interlocks
would
be
barred
by
this
statute.
this
statute
again
applies
only
where
the
corporations
are
competing
in
the
sense
that
an
agreement
to
eliminate
competition
between
them
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
an
insurance
company
is
free
to
have
a
bank
director
on
the
board
as
long
as
that
director
is
not
selected
from
a
bank
that
poses
those
concerns.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think...
well,
even
if
the...
even
if
these
interlocking
directorates
came
to
their
attention,
again
i
would
make
the
point
that
just
because
they
exist
does
not
mean
that
they
violate
the
statute.
one
would
have
to
analyze
on
a
case-by-case
basis
to
know
whether
the
interlocked
corporations
are
competitors.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we...
we
don't
have
any...
we
don't
have
any
indication
of
congressional
reaction
in
the...
in
the
ensuing
years.
the
only
thing
petitioners
have
pointed
to
is
congress'
enactment
in
1933
of
section
8(a)
of
the
clayton
act,
which
was
subsequently
repealed
in
1935,
which
barred
interlocks
in
essentially
a
vertical
relationship
as
part
of
the
glass-stiegell
prohibitions
against
involving
banks
and
speculation
by...
in
securities
speculation.
and
that...
petitioners
have
attempted
to
argue
that
the
repeal
of
that
somehow
suggests
that
congress
was...
was
content
with
these
relationships.
but
in
fact,
that
position
had
nothing
to
do
with
horizontal
or
competing
relationships,
it
had
to
do
with
a
quite
separate
problem
of
involving
banks
in...
in
securities
measures.
so
other
than
that,
we
just
have...
i
believe
we
would
be
reduced
to
speculation
that
that...
that
congress
as
a
body
was
aware
of
these
arrangements
and
thought
them
consistent
with
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i...
there...
there
have
been
these
staff
reports
that
have
called
it
to
the
attention
of
congress.
but
there...
but
what
we
have
there
are
simply
staff
reports,
they
are
not
expressions
of...
of
understanding
by
congress
or
expressions
of
an
intent
by
congress
not
to
regulate
in
the
area.
the
bills
that
counsel
has
referred
to
died.
they
were
not...
the...
and
the
failure
to
enact
the
bill
to
overturn
a
state
of
affairs
has
always
been
viewed
by
this
court
as
being,
and
especially
the
basis
for
overturning
a
statutory
interpretation
especially...
about
which
the
court
should
be
especially
cautious.
and
particularly,
the
efforts
that
counsel
focuses
on
from
1965
on,
a
period
that
is
50
years
after
the
passage
of
the
clayton
act,
congress'
failure
to
act
one
way
or
another
in
that
period,
in
fact,
even
in
the
decades
prior
to
that,
comes
so
long
after
the
clayton
act
that
it's
difficult
to
attribute
congress'
actions
so
much
later
to
the
intent
of
the
enacting
congress.
if
i
could
return
for
a
moment
to
the
presumptions
governing
the
recognition
of
exemptions
from
antitrust
laws,
i
have
already
mentioned
the
obvious
one
concerning
the
liberal
interpretation
of
the
statutes
and
the
narrowness
of
the
exemptions,
but
there
are
two
other--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i...
i...
i
regard
that
as
essentially
a
semantic
difference.
it
quite...
under
their
view,
the...
the...
the
statute,
which
is
otherwise
written
to
apply
to
all
corporations
engaged
in
commerce,
assuming
the
million
dollars'
capital
assets
are
satisfied,
we
have
what
amounts
to
a
clause
upon
which
they
rely
for
an
exclusion
from
that
provision.
so
i...
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it's...
it's...
it's
different
in
the
sense
that
they
were
enacted
at
different
times,
but
i
think
that
it's...
the
analysis
is
the
same
in
the
sense
that
the...
that
the
exemption
for
which
the
petitioners
are
arguing
cuts
against
the
grain
of
the...
of
the
principal
prohibition,
which
based
on
the
legislative
history
and
the
broad
political
support
that
gave
rise
to
it
was...
was...
reflected
a
congressional
intent
broadly
to
attack
these
interlocking
directorates.
and
piecing
the
bank
paragraphs
and
paragraph
4
together,
they
together
reflect
a
comprehensive
approach
to
the
problem.
and
if
one
reads
the
"other
than
banks"
language
as
simply
referring
back
to
the
separate
regulation
of
banks
and
no
broader,
then
you
have
a
comprehensive
package
which
both
gives
effect
to
the
purpose
of
not
having
inconsistent
treatment
of
banks
and
also
gives
effect
to
the
broad
congressional
purpose
to
recognize...
to
prohibit
these
interlocks.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
give
the
interpretation
which
petitioners
urge,
you
have
an
exemption
for
banks
and
insurance
companies
based
on
a
clause
that
doesn't
even
mention
insurance
companies,
situations
that
are
concededly
within
the
policy
of
what
congress
was
focusing
on
in
terms
of
competing
corporations
and,
therefore,
cutting
against
the
grain.
so
i
think
in
that
respect,
the
analysis
is
largely
the
same.
this...
this
brings
me
to
the
second
of
the
points
dealing
with
the
presumption.
ordinarily,
when
congress
has
provided
for
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
for
an
entity
within
a
particular
business,
this
court
has
been
reluctant
to
extend
that
immunity
or
exemption
to
arrangements
between
the
corporations
and
the
industry
and
other
entities
outside.
well,
here
we
have
another
situation
in
that...
in
that
category
where
the...
the
clause
in
question
is
said
to
provide
immunity
not
only
for
the
banking
institutions
mentioned
but
also
for
insurance
companies.
and
thirdly,
that
this
court
has
generally
recognized
that
where
there
is
an
antitrust
immunity,
that's
ordinarily
predicated
on
the
existence
of
some
regulatory
authority
elsewhere
to
protect
the
public
interest
against
the
sort
of
abuses
that
the
antitrust
laws
would
otherwise
bar.
and
in
this
situation,
if
the...
if
the
clause
upon
which
petitioners
rely
is
limited
to
banks,
then...
then
that
pattern
is
sustained
here
because
interlocks
between
banking
institutions
are
in
fact
separately
regulated.
they
are
separately
regulated
by
the
initial
paragraphs
of...
of
section
8
itself,
and
now
more
recently
in
1978
they
are
separately
regulated
by
the
depository
institution
interlocks
act.
so
on
the...
on
the
other
hand,
the
interlocks
between
banks
and
insurance
companies
that
we
have
involved
in
this
case
are
not
separately
regulated
by
the
initial
paragraphs
or
by
the
bank
interlocks
act,
although
there
was
an
amendment
offered
in
1978
to...
to
extend
the
coverage
to
include
bank-insurance
company
interlocks
after
the
district
court's
decision
in
this
case,
that
was
rejected
not
on
the
merits
but
because
it
was
not...
it
was
not
germane
to
the
bill
and
would
have
been
under
the
judiciary...
judiciary
committee's
jurisdiction.
and
along
the
same
lines
with
the
analysis
on
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws,
we
think
that
the
analysis
that...
that
we
urge
the
court
to
adopt
is
supported
by
looking
at
the
structure
of
the
act.
as
passed,
the
initial
paragraphs
of
section
8
cover
interlocks
between
banking
institutions
with
certain
carefully
crafted
exceptions
showing
that
where
congress
wants
to
accept
interlocks
even
in
that
category,
it
has
done
so.
the
succeeding
paragraph
contains
the
general
prohibition
against
interlocks
between
competing
corporations
generally,
limited
only
by
the
phrase
we
have
here
and
the
common...
other
than
common
carriers.
now,
it's
significant
that
the
substantive
standards
in
the
initial
paragraphs
of
section
8
are
different
from
those
in
the...
in
the
fourth
paragraph.
as
initially
enacted,
for
example,
the
banking
paragraphs
barred
interlocks
only
where
one
of
the
institutions
had
capital
or
paid-in
surplus
exceeding
$5
million,
which
is
a
figure
considerably
higher
than
the...
than
the
$1
million
figure
necessary
to
trigger
paragraph
4.
and
there
was
also
a
prohibition
against
interlocks
in
cities
of
200,000
or
more
without
regard
to
the
amount
of
capital.
under
paragraph
4,
in
contrast,
the...
the
standards
were
somewhat
different.
the
initial
paragraphs
covered
more
than
simply
directors,
they
covered
interlocks
between
other
officials.
paragraph
4
just
covered
directors.
and
even
though,
as
counsel
for
petitioners
points
out,
the
act
was
amended,
the
initial
banking
paragraphs
of
the
act
were
amended
over
the
years.
even
now
they
contain
different
standards
prohibiting
the
interlocks
than
those
now
in
paragraph
4.
so
we...
we
submit
that
the
natural
reading
of
the
phrase
upon
which
petitioners
rely
here
is
that
it
serves
to
ensure
that
the
bank...
bank
interlocks
that
are
governed
by
initial
paragraphs
are
not
also
subject
by
the
somewhat
inconsistent
standards
in
paragraph
4.
and
those
same,
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
structure
of
the
act
also
suggests
that
congress
legislated
in
paragraph
4
generally
with
respect
to
interlocks
and
in
addition
legislated
with
respect
to
banks
because
of
a
concern
over
the
concentration
of
capital.
if
you
put
those
together,
the
structure
does
not
suggest
an
intent
nevertheless
to
exempt
interlocks
that
somehow
fall
between
the
cracks
of
the
two.
and
yet,
that's
essentially
what
petitioners
urge
here,
because
they
do
not,
as
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
federal
trade
commission
in
its
parallel
perpetual
case
found,
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
carefully
considered
the
situation
of
interlocks
between
banks
and
competing
non-banks
and
decided
that
they
should
be
exempt
from
the...
affirmatively
decided
that
they
should
be
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws
for
some
reason
that
justified
an
exception
to
the
general
policy.
now,
it
may
be
that
in
1914,
when
congress
was
enacting
the
clayton
act,
that
many
of
the
members
did
not
believe
that
banks
were
engaged
in
commerce
or
that
insurance
companies
were
engaged
in
commerce.
this
court
had
so
held
in
nathan
versus
louisiana
and
in
paul
burke
versus
virginia
with
respect
to
banking
and
insurance.
and
so
therefore,
the
congress
that
enacted
this
statute
may
not
have
been
thinking
of
paragraph
4
as
reaching
those
sorts
of
interlocks
between
banks
and
insurance
companies
or
one
or
the
other.
but
this
court
made
clear
in
southeastern
underwriters
that
the...
even...
even
though
the
enacting
congress
may
not
have
anticipated
that
this
court
would
subsequently
rule
that
in
that
case
insurance
is
part
of
commerce,
that
that
did
not
mean
that
the
language
in
the
statute
congress
enacted
should
be
limited
in
that
fashion.
and
that
same
principle
was
applied
to
banks
and
specifically
to
the
clayton
act
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
where
the
court
noted
in
a
footnote
that
the
banks
there
didn't
even
challenge
the
proposition
that
they
were
engaged
in
commerce,
citing
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
transamerica
where
the
court
had
engaged
in
the
same
analysis
under
the
clayton
act,
that
even
though
the...
the
congress
that
passed
the
clayton
act
may
not
have
anticipated
that
banks
were
part
of
commerce,
that
as
that
language
was
expanded
or
the
interpretation
of
that
language
was
expanded
then
too
the
application
of
the
act
should.
and
in
fact,
the
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
refers
to
corporations
engaged
in
commerce
in
language
that
is
directly
parallel
to
paragraph
4
of
section
8.
i
would
like
to
address
then,
just
in
conclusion,
the
discussion
of
the
debate
on
the
conference
report.
we
think
in
a
situation
like
this,
particularly
reading
the
statute
against
its...
its
purposes
and
the
structure
of
the
act,
that...
that
it
would
be
particularly
unwise
to
rely
on
scattered
pieces
of
discussion
in
the
legislative
history--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i...
i
would
concede
that
that
reasonable
persons
can
differ
as
the...
as
the
two...
as
the
two
courts
below
have
indicated,
the
federal
trade
commission--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
am
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
am
not
saying...
i
am
not
saying
that
it
should
be
ignored,
but
what...
what
should
be...
i
think
what
the
court's
task
in
a
case
such
as
this
is
through...
to
reconcile
the
competing...
the
competing
policies
and
to...
and
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's...
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the...
but
the
presumptions
that
i
am
speaking
of
are
not
judge-made
rules,
they
are
guides
to
the
interpretation
of
the
body
of
antitrust...
of
antitrust
statutes
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
that...
that
is
thought
to
reflect
the
intent
of
the
congress
that
enacts
those
statutes
by--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i...
i
mispoke.
what
i
am...
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
court
has
used
it
as
a...
as
a
guide
to
defining
the
intent
of
congress
where
congress
has
enacted
a
broad
statute
as
the
sherman
act
or
as
paragraph
4
here
is,
that...
that
the
general
prohibition
should
be
liberally
construed
to
effectuate
congress'
purpose
as...
as
remedial
statutes
generally
are.
and
the
question
before
the
court
then
is
whether
these
particular...
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
is
whether
these
particular
references
are
sufficient
to
overcome
the...
the
purposes
of
the...
of
the
clayton
act
as...
as
this
court
observed
just
last
term
in...
in
rose
versus
lundy
and
in
the
previous
term
in
pennhurst.
it's
necessary
to
focus
where...
where
statutory
terms
are
ambiguous,
not
just
on
the
particular
phrase
but
to
look
at
the
statute
as
a
whole
and
the
purposes
and
the
policies.
and
we
think
that
in
these
situations,
the
conference
report
references
are
not...
do
not
overcome
those
points.
