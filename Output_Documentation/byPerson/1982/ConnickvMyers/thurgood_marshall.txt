suppose
the
trial--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--suppose
the
trial
judge
said,
i
have
considered
the
other
pickering
point
and
reject
it,
period.
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
said,
i've
considered
them
and
rejected
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
wouldn't
be
arguing
that,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
your
argument
is,
he
didn't
say
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
he
has
to
say
that...
why
he
rejects
it?
isn't
that
what
you're
really
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
didn't
raise
the
question
in
this
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
raise
the
question
that
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
pass
them
out?
it
says
so.
the
opinion
says
so.
it
said,
no...
for
confidentialities
asserted
in
regard
to
the
distribution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
object
to
her
handing
out
the
questionnaire
per
se?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
had
never
been
questioned
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
questionnaire?
justice
thurgood
marshall
indicating?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
questions
like
politics?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
questions
like
politics,
for
example?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
as
to
whether
they
had
faith
in
the
officers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
can
she
use
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
other
than
to
disrupt
the
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
she
do
other
than
disrupt
the
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
also
true
she
telephoned
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
she
telephoned
people--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--about
the
questionnaire?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
have
never
heard
of
anybody
overhearing
a
telephone
conversation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
talking
about
public
and
private,
do
you
know
of
any
private
organization
that
allows
you
to
circulate
questionnaires
while
you're
working?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i'm
saying.
but
still,
they
don't
allow
it,
do
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
bet
you
it
does.
don't
you
agree
that
at
least
for
one
day
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
didn't
do
anything
on
behalf
of
her
job?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
doesn't
the
record
show
and
the
judge's
findings
show
that
during
that
day
she
passed
out
the
questionnaire,
she
carried
it
around
and
gave
it
to
people,
made
sure
she
didn't
let
anybody
see
it,
she
telephoned
people,
she
had
people
come
in?
isn't
that
what
the
record
shows,
in
one
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
other
time
is
left?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'd
like
to
see...
well,
how
can...
do
you
have
lunch
all
afternoon?
the
record
says
during
the
afternoon
she
called
people.
