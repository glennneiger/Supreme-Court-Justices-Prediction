justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
initial
question
of
whether
the
speech
here
is
constitutionally
protected
one
of
a...
that
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
or
a
purely
legal
question,
or
what
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
your
position
that
in
public
employment,
that
a
questionnaire
sent
out
to
other
employees
that
addressed
only
the
question
of
the
activities
that
the
employees
were
being
asked
to
engage
in
that
are
political
in
nature
would
not
be
constitutionally
protected?
that
is
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
there
were
two
questions--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
if
there
are
two
questions,
that
one
plus
one
that
is
not
of
public
concern,
that
the
situation
would
change?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
did
you
appeal
from
the
attorneys'
fees
issue
to
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
not
purely
a
factual
question,
though,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
wouldn't
apply
a
clearly
erroneous
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
at
best
it's
a
mixed
question.
