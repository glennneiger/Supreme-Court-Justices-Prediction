we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
connick
against
myers.
mr.
wessel,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
have
to
convince
us...
you
have
to
persuade
us
that
the
district
judge's
findings
generally
were
in...
clearly
erroneous
because
of
your
claim
that
she
was
dismissed
for
refusing
to
accept
a
reassignment
within
the
office?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
the
narrow
issue?
whether
there
were
other
issues
or
not,
isn't
that
the
issue
on
which
you
stand
or
fall?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
contend
that
the
district
attorney
had
an
absolute
unilateral
right
to
assign
her
to
any
part
of
the
office
he
wanted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
that
the
heart
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
none
whatsoever.
was
not
the
transfer
indicated
before
the
questionnaire
was--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--are
you
saying
that
the
questionnaire
was
provoked
or
was
a
response
to
the
transfer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
your
position
that
there
were
two
reasons
for
dismissing
her,
or
one?
that
is,
was
she
dismissed
because
she
refused
to
accept
the
transfer,
or
because
she
circulated
the
questionnaire?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
strickler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree
with
what
your
friend
suggested,
that
the
transfer
notice
preceded
the
questionnaire?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
we
know
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
strickler--
--one
of
the
elements
of
relief
here
was
ordering
her
reinstatement,
besides
giving
her
some
damages.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
reinstated
into
what
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
her
old
position
or
the
new
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
she
accept
the
transfer
or
not
under
this--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--the
lower
courts
endorsed
the
assignment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
do
you
find
any
internal
inconsistency
in
the
court's
finding
in
which
he
said,
the
defendant,
the
district
attorney,
neither
acted
with
malice
nor
reckless
or
wanton
disregard
for
plaintiff's
civil
rights?
do
you
find
any
inconsistency
between
that
finding
and
the
other
findings
that
he
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
entirely
consistent
with
the
fact
that
she
was
notified
of
her
transfer
before
the
questionnaire
was
circulated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
she
did
refuse
to
accept
the
transfer,
didn't
she?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
a
superior
tells
a
subordinate,
gives
a
subordinate
an
order,
and
the
subordinate
says,
i
will
think
about
it,
i
will
consider
it,
what
do
you
call
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
