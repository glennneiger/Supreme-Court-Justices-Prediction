justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
clarified
one
thing?
you
have
reviewed
the
facts.
do
you
challenge
any
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court
as
clearly
erroneous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
it
fair...
didn't
you
argue...
this
was
argued
to
the
district
judge,
wasn't
it,
that
the
transfer
was
the
real
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when
he
did
not
enter
such
a
finding
and
only
found
one
reason,
the...
and
he
says
it
in
so
many
words,
that
she
was
fired
because
of
the
questionnaire,
isn't
that
a...
didn't
he...
don't
we
have
to
assume
he
rejected
the
second
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
goes
to
whether
it's
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
all
the
rest,
but
as
to...
his
findings
on
motivation
i
thought
were
rather
clear,
that
he
considered
all
the
evidence
pertaining
to
the
transfer
and
said
that
the
real
reason
was
the
questionnaire.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
saying
that
that
is
a
clearly
erroneous
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wessel,
the
district
judge
didn't...
he
found
the
facts
differently.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
found
that
connick
told
the
plaintiff
she
was
being
fired
because
of
a
refusal
to
accept
a
transfer,
so
he
was
fully
aware
of
that
contention,
and
then
he
later
found
the
real
reason
was
the
questionnaire.
now,
you
describe
it
as
a
dual
motive
case,
but
he
found
it
was
a
single
motive
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that
is
clearly
erroneous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
say...
you
talk
about
dual
motive.
supposing
the
questionnaire
could
be
characterized
as
sort
of
a
hybrid.
most
of
the
questions
are
just
internal
office
matters,
but
one
or
two
were
matters
of
public
concern.
would
the
questionnaire
be
protected
or
unprotected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
saying
the
questionnaire
is
not
protected
even
though
one
of
the
questions
might
have
been
protected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
argument,
i
gather,
is
that
the
entire
questionnaire
was
unprotected,
even
though
it
contained
one
question
which,
had
it
been
asked
separately,
would
have
been
protected.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
not
that...
yes,
it
has
to
do
with
operation
of
the
office,
but
would
you
not
think
it
was
a
matter
of
public
concern
if
the
assistant
attorneys
were
being
pressured
to
work
in
political
campaigns
on
behalf
of
their
superiors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
not
the
question.
that
is
not
the
question.
the
question
is
whether
that
information
would
be
a
matter
of
public
concern,
whichever
way
the
answer
comes
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
that
the
public
would
want
to
know
if
the
assistants
in
the
office
were
being
pressured
to
work
for
political
candidates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
really
don't
think
that's
a
fair
characterization
of
his
argument.
he
says
that
it's
basically
an
internal
matter
that
pickering
doesn't
apply
to.
i
don't
think
he
says
it
quite
the
way
you
describe
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
insofar
as
it
goes
to
running
an
office,
that
the
person
in
charge
of
the
office
has
a
right
to
discharge
someone
for
making
disruptive
comments
in
the
office
that
don't
have
any
particular
public
value.
that's
the
thrust
of
his
argument,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--turning
for
a
moment
to
the
question
whether
the
first
amendment
protects
the
circulation
of
the
questionnaire,
do
you
think
any
of
the
questions
in
the
questionnaire,
other
than
the
one
about
feeling
political
pressure,
are
matters
of
public
concern?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
that
on
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
statement
was
a
'matter
of
public
concern
or
not,
it's
totally
indifferent
whether
the
statement
was
made
publicly
or
privately?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
relevant
to
the
question
whether
there's
disruption.
the
question
of
whether
the
issue
is
a
matter
of
public
concern,
i
don't
see
why
it
would
make
any
difference.
