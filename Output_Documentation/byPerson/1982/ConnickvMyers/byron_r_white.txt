do
you
think
it
was
just
mere
accident
that
the
questionnaire
was
circulated
during
the
same
time...
during
the
same
period
of
time
that
a
transfer
was
being
talked
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
was
her...
circulating
the
questionnaire
was
in
response
to
suggestions
that
she
be
transferred?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
so
it
was
the
fact
that
she
was
being...
she
was
going
to
be
transferred.
was
this
her
way
of
combatting
her
transfer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
wasn't
it
then
just
an
accident
that
she--
justice
byron
r.
white
--including
hers.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
then
came,
as
a
response,
the
questionnaire.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice

the
second
case
is
a
connick
against
myers
which
is
here
from
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
--
court
of
appeals.
the
petitioner,
myers
is
an
assistant
--
was
an
assistant
district
attorney
in
new
orleans.
and
one
day
--
one
day
she
circulated
a
--
a
questionnaire
in
the
office
among
her
--
to
her
colleagues
asking
what
they
thought
about
the
office's
transfer
policy,
asking
how
office
morale
was
and
their
opinion,
and
asking
whether
--
what
degree
of
confidence
they
had
in
their
superiors.
and
also,
whether
they
felt
that
they
were
under
some
pressure
to
perform
political
duties.
when
petitioner,
connick,
the
district
attorney
heard
about
this,
he
thought
it
was
an
act
of
insubordination
and
discharged
myers.
she
then
filed
suit,
claiming
that
her
discharge
violated
her
first
amendment
rights.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
her
and
ordered
to
--
her
reinstatement
with
backpay.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
reverse
that
judgment.
in
our
view,
myers'
first
amendment
rights
were
not
violated
and
our
reasons
for
thinking
so
were
stated
in
an
opinion
which
we
have
filed
with
the
clerk.
justice
brennan
joined
by
justices
marshall,
blackmun
and
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
