mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
judge
gordon,
the
trial
judge
in
this
case,
conducted
a
full
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
matter.
he
gave
all
parties
concerned
the
maximum
opportunity
to
put
on
all
the
evidence
they
wished
to
put
on.
on
the
basis
of
that
record,
he
made
the
following
findings.
he
found
that
sheila
myers
was
discharged
because
of
her
circulation
of
the
questionnaire.
he
found
that
sheila
myers
would
not
have
been
discharged
but
for
the
circulation
of
the
questionnaire.
he
found
that
neither
the
content
nor
the
time,
place,
or
manner
of
the
circulation
of
the
questionnaire
in
any
way
disrupted
her
performance
of
her
work
as
an
assistant
district
attorney
or
in
any
way
disrupted
the
performance
of
the...
or
the
effective
operation
of
the
da's
office.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
chief
justice.
the...
ms.
myers
did
receive
informal
notice
prior...
maybe
two
days
prior
to
the
circulation
of
the
questionnaire
that
she
was
to
be
tansferred.
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
district
court
are
not
clearly
erroneous.
they
are
supported,
amply
supported
in
the
record
of
this
case.
they
are,
of
course,
facts
to
which
this
court
has
frequently
held
that
rule
52(a)
applies.
indeed,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
also
insulated
from
review
by
this
court's
well
established
two-court
rule,
because
the
fifth
circuit
also
heard
the
same
argument
that
mr.
wessel
is
making
today.
the...
mr.
wessel
says
that
the
district
court
never
considered
the
reasons
put
forward
by
mr.
connick
for
the...
his...
the
basis
for
the
firing,
that
is,
his
reasons
that
there
had
been
a
refusal
to
accept
the
transfer.
that
is
simply
not
true.
the
judge
did...
judge
gordon
did
consider
that,
and
it
is
clear
in
his
opinion
that
he
found
that
sheila
myers
had
not
refused
a
transfer.
he
found
that
mr.
connick
did
not
believe
she
had
refused
a
transfer.
indeed,
when
mr.
connick
came
back
to
his
office
after
hearing
about
the
questionnaire,
he
started
interviewing
various
assistant
district
attorneys
who
had
received
the
questionnaire,
and
he
wasn't
interested
in
interviewing
them
as
to
whether
sheila
myers
was
refusing
to
transfer.
he
was
interested
in
the
content
of
the
questionnaire.
in
fact,
he
interviewed
one
district
attorney...
his
name
is
fred
ours,
who
was
from
section
i,
that
is,
the
section
of
court
to
which
ms.
myers
was
to
be
transferred,
who
had
talked
with
ms.
myers
only
that
morning
about
how
they
were
going
to
split
up
the
work
in
section
i,
but
mr.
connick
wasn't
interested
in
that.
he
was
interested
on
the
questionnaire.
so,
the
district
court's
finding
that
not
only
had
there
not
been
a
refusal
to
accept
the
transfer,
but
also
that
mr.
connick
didn't
believe
there
had
been
a
refusal,
is
also
well
supported
in
the
record.
it
is
a
finding
with
regard
to
motivation
which
this
court
in
pullman
standard
versus
swint
last
term
found
is
a
fact
to
which
rule
52(a)
applies.
since
the
petitioner
cannot
really
do
anything
with
those
facts,
he
urges
this
court
to
hold
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
content
of
this
questionnaire
was
so
totally
devoid
of
value
as
to
be
per
se
unfit
for
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
in
effect,
what
he
is
saying
is
that
the
district
court
erred
in
even
applying
pickering
at
all,
because
the
questionnaire
falls
within
one
of
those
narrow
kinds
of
speech
which
this
court
has
found
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment
to
begin
with.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
justice
stevens,
the
reason
i'm
saying
that
is
because
the
petitioner
seems
to
make...
base
his
whole
argument
on
a
distinction
between
matters
of
"public
concern"
and
matters
not
of
public
concern,
and
i
perceive
his
argument
to
be
that
on
a
matter
where
an
employee
is
speaking
internally,
within
the
office,
on
a
matter
not
of
public
concern,
that
that
is
a
matter
outside
of
the
first
amendment
protection,
and
that
pickering
shouldn't
even
have
been
applied
there.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
well,
if
that's
the
thrust
of
the
argument,
your
honor,
i
certainly
would
not
disagree
that
the
content
of
the
questionnaire,
whether
it
affects
a
matter
of
great
public
concern
or
only
a
very
narrow
internal
matter,
is
a
relevant
circumstance
to
be
weighed
in
the
pickering
analysis.
this
court
has
said
in
givhan
versus
western
line
consolidated
school
district
that
where
the
speech
is
internal,
not
only
the
content
but
the
manner
in
which
it
is
made,
and
the
time
and
place
and
so
forth,
all
the
factors
be
weighed,
and
i
certainly
would
concede
that
the
content
of
the
questionnaire
must
be
weighed
in
the
pickering
balance.
the
district
judge
in
this
case
did
that.
he
found
that
this
was
a
matter
that
was
of
public
concern.
i
think
he
was
clearly
right.
certainly
the
district
judge,
the
person
that's
on
the
local
scene,
is
the
person
best
able
to
make--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
have
no
way
to
say
what
the
district
judge
would
have
done
in
that
case,
but
i
think
clearly
if
the
questionnaire
had
only
been
directed
to
the
confidence
in
that
he...
under
these
circumstances,
he
would
have
found
it
protected,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
four
of
the
five
persons
mentioned
in
question
10,
these
middle
level
supervisors,
as
the
personnel
testified,
they
were
all
called
as
witnesses
by
the
defendant,
none
testified
that
in
any
way
was
their
working
relationship
with
ms.
myers
in
any
way
poisoned
or
interrupted
or
would
be
interrupted
in
the
future
by
this
questionnaire.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
they
didn't
testify
that
it
wasn't,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that's
the...
they
weren't...
they
weren't
asked
the
question
to
the
defendant,
and
i
think
that's
the
clear
implication
from
their
testimony,
that
it
would
not
have
been.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
absolutey,
and
i
think
our
argument
is
exactly
the
same.
mr.
connick
did
not
go
to
his...
these
four
persons
or
five
persons
and
ask
them,
do
you
feel
your
integrity
is
being
questioned,
can
you
work
in
the
future
with
sheila
myers.
he
didn't
ask...
they
were
in
the
room
with
him
when
he...
or
some
of
them
were
in
the
room
when
he
fired
sheila
myers.
he
didn't
even
consult
with
them.
joe
meyer--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--your
honor,
in
the
pickering
case
itself
where
this
branch
of
the
law
started,
the
school
superintendent
and
all
the
members
of
the
school
board
testified
without
contradiction
that
they
thought
that
letter
written
by
the
school
teacher,
pickering,
was
incredibly
damaging
to
the
future
ability
of
the
school
board
to
raise
money,
to
get
its
bond
selection
out,
and
so
forth,
and
this
court
said
there
wasn't
a
shred
of
evidence
of
that.
you
cannot,
going
back
to
tinker
versus
des
moines
school
system,
you
cannot
restrict
the
first
amendment
rights
on
an
unsupported
fear
of--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
the...
think
that
certainly
the
question...
pickering
makes
relevant
the
question
of
whether
the...
or
the
issue
of
whether
the
questionnaire
would
have
disrupted
the
harmonious
working
relationships
with
intermediate
staff
and
perhaps
even
with
mr.
connick
himself.
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
that...
that
there
was
going
to
be
any
such
disharmony,
and
indeed
the
district
court
found
that
there
wouldn't
be.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
"and
the
adverse
feeling
necessarily
engendered
by
her
resort
to
judicial
remedies.
"
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
as
you
said,
you...
no
one
should
ignore
what
is
common
sense,
and
any
time
that
there
has
been
a
discharge
in
any
kind
of
employment
there
are
going
to
be
some
acrimonious
feelings
about
that,
and
when
the
employee,
the
rejected
employee
files
suit
to
enforce
his
or
her
rights,
there
is
going
to
be
some
ill
feeling
about
that.
the
judge
heard
the
testimony.
he
recognized
that
fact.
he
was
exercising
his
equitable
discretion.
there
is
not
a
hint
in
this
record
that
judge
gordon
felt
that
he
was
compelled
to
grant
reinstatement,
but
he
listened
to
all
the
evidence,
and
he
found
that
even
though
there
might
be
some
ill
feelings
arising
out
of
this
litigation
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
it,
that
reinstatement
was
appropriate
anyway.
he
didn't...
but
at
the
same
time,
he
was
clearly...
he
clearly
weighed
the
pickering
balance,
or
made
the...
applied
the
pickering
balancing
procedure,
and
found
that
with
regard
to
the
content
of
the
questionnaire,
it
would
not
create
such
a
disharmony
in
the
district
attorney's
office
that
it
would
make
ms.
myers'
ability
to
continue
functioning
there
impossible
or
inefficient.
indeed...
and
there
was,
of
course,
ample
reason
for
him
to
believe
that.
mr.
connick
certainly
didn't
testify
that
he
himself
couldn't
in
any
way
put
his
trust
in
sheila
myers
in
the
future.
joe
meyer,
her
immediate
supervisor,
testified,
and
he
said,
i
don't
look
over
the
shoulder
of
anybody.
if
they
come
and
consult
with
me,
they
have...
on
a
matter,
a
particular
tactical
matter,
i
will
talk
to
them,
but
i
don't
go
around
the
courts
looking
over
their
shoulders,
and
particularly
in
sheila
myers'
case,
she
was
the
most
senior
attorney
we
had.
of
course,
joe
meyer
was,
even
though
he
was
the
immediate
supervisor
of
ms.
myers,
he
wasn't
even
consulted
before
the
discharge.
he
wasn't
even
called
in.
and
one
would
think
that
he
would
be
the
person
whose
concern
with
regard
to
harmonious
working
relationship
would
be
the
most...
would
be
the
most
relevant.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
justice
white,
it
certainly
was
not
an
accident.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
it
certainly
was
not
an
accident.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
i
believe
the
record
does
reflect
and
the
district
judge
found
that
the
transfers
and
the
manner
in
which
the
transfers
were
announced
was
what
started
the
ball
rolling.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
absolutely...
absolutely
not.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
i
believe
that
the,
justice
white,
the
record
shows
that
ms.
myers
was
unhappy
about
the
transfer
of
herself,
she
was
unhappy
about
the
way
all
the
transfers
were--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--including
hers.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
well,
no,
that's
not
quite
accurate.
the
first
thing
that
came--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--was
a
meeting
with
the
first
assistant,
mr.
waldren,
at
which,
according
to
both
mr.
waldren's
testimony
and
ms.
myers',
the
discussion
started
off
about
the
transfers,
but
kind
of
went
on
into...
and
broadened
in
scope,
about
various
things
that
ms.
myers
had
to
say
about
the
efficient
working
of
the
da's
office.
mr.
waldern
suggested,
and
again
this
is
what
the
court
found,
mr.
waldren
suggested
that
ms.
myers
was
speaking
only
on
her
own,
and
that
other
people
did
not
share
her
views.
ms.
myers
said,
no,
that's...
i
think
i
do...
i
am
speaking
for
other
people,
and
my
view
is
not
unique,
and
she
said
she
would
do
some
research
on
it,
and
what
she
did
then
was
prepare
the
questionnaire.
and
i
take
issue
with
what
mr.
wessel
said.
mr.
wessel
said
the
questionnaire
is
a...
it
is
just
a
kind
of
a...
putting
the
questions,
these
internal
and
petty
gripes
about
her
own
transfer.
i
think
if
you...
the
questionnaire,
of
course,
is
reprinted
in
the
cert
petition,
and
it
clearly
shows
that
it
has
a
broader
scope.
it
deals
with
general
morale
in
the
office,
as
well
as--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--the
purpose
of
the
questionnaire
was
to...
for
ms.
myers
to
be
able
to
come
back
with
some
material
indicating
that
her
views
were
not
unique.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
unique.
and
were
not
different
from
many
other
assistant
district
attorneys'.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
on
questions
about
whether,
for
example--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--the
question
of
whether
da's
felt
they
had
been
pressured
to
work
in
political
campaigns,
yes.
absolutely.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
yes.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
well,
what
she--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--what
she
intended
to
do--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--what
she
intended
to
do,
justice
marshal,
was
not
to
go
to
the
press
or
go
spread
around
things
to
the
outside
world,
but
to
present
the
views,
that
is,
the
results
to
mr.
waldren.
now,
she
never
got
to
do
that
because
she
got
fired,
but
that
was
her
intent.
the
record
makes...
she
testified
to
that,
and
it
is
certainly
not
contradicted,
that
that's
what
she
intended
to
do
with
the
results.
ms.
myers,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
marshal,
made
every
effort
to
keep
this
questionnaire
from
getting
out
to
persons
other
than
those
directly
concerned.
she
didn't...
she
testified
that
she
didn't
even
put
the
questionnaire
in
the
mailboxes
of
the
da's
for
fear
that
someone
else
would
see
it.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
she
testified
to
that,
and
it
is
not
contradicted.
and
i
believe
there
is
a
finding
to
that
effect
in
the
district
court.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
to
find
out
whether
they
were--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
to
find
out
whether
they
were
available.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
i
don't
believe
the
record
reflects
whether
the...
i
believe
the
record
reflects
that
she
telephoned
persons
to
find
out
whether
they
were
available,
and
then
she
went
and
gave
the
questionnaire
to
them.
the
district
attorneys
who
testified
who
received
the
questionnaire
said
it
took
a
minute,
two
minutes
to
do.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
she
was--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--the
reinstatement
just
simply
said,
as
an
assistant
district
attorney,
and
did
not--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--oh,
absolutely.
absolutely.
it
was
never--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--it
was
never
our
contention
that
ms.
myers
was
entitled
to
reinstatement
to
a
particular
section.
no,
sir.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
no,
sir.
that
finding
is
with
regard
to
our
claim
for
punitive
damage,
and
i
believe
that
a
finding
that
a
person
has
not
acted
recklessly
or
with
malice
for
purposes
of
punitive
damages
does
not
mean
the
person
hasn't
acted
knowing
the
consequences
or
knowing
what
his
actions
will
entail.
and
certainly
the
district
judge
found
that,
as
a
finding
of
facts,
that
mr.
connick
had
acted
because
of
the
questionnaire
and
would
not
have
acted
but
for
the
questionnaire.
i
don't
believe
there's
anything
inconsistent
in
saying
that,
in
saying
that
he
acted
without
malice.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
she
was
notified
of
her
transfer,
your
honor,
but
the
questionnaire
was
not
a
part
and
parcel
of
any
refusal
to
accept
the
transfer.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
she
did
not,
your
honor.
there
is
a
finding...
the
court
found
that
she
did
not
accept...
refuse
to
accept
the
transfer.
in
fact,
when
she
talked
to
mr.
waldren
and
mr.
connick,
she
said,
i
will
consider
it.
now,
there
were
two
witnesses
who
testified,
contrary
to
ms.
myers'
testimony,
that
she
had
flatly
refused
to
accept
the
transfer.
the
district
judge
heard
their
testimony
and
didn't
believe
them.
there
was
ample
reason
not
to
believe
them.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
i
don't
call
it
an
absolute,
flat
refusal
to
accept
an
order.
indeed,
the
district
judge
found
on
the
morning
that
ms.
myers
was
fired
she
had
a
conversation
with
mr.
connick,
she
told
him
that
she
would
consider
it,
consider
accepting
the
transfer,
and
at
that
point
mr.
connick
thought
that
was
a
satisfactory
answer.
he
didn't...
he
certainly
didn't
fire
her
at
that
point
or
say,
that's
unsatisfactory,
or
whatever.
that
was
a
finding
of
fact
made
by
the
district
judge.
i
think
that
this...
the
context
in
which
this
has
to
be
reviewed,
your
honor,
is
the
fact
that
mr.
connick
also
testified
that
complaints
about
transfers,
internal
complaints
to
him
about
transfers
were
very
common,
and
that
while
he
didn't
think
they
were
negotiable,
at
the
same
time
he
didn't...
indeed,
put
very
little
weight
on
the
fact
that
da's
frequently
complained
about
going
one
place
or
the
other.
in
fact,
he
testified
that
on
occasion
he
had
allowed
ms.
myers
on
an
earlier
occasion
to
talk
him
out
of
being
transferred.
so,
the
finding
that
mr.
connick
thought
it
was
acceptable
that
she
said
she
was
going
to
consider
it
is
certainly
not
only
supported
in
the
record
but
it
is
understandable.
i
think
the
important
point,
though,
is
the
district
court
found
that
mr.
connick
did
not
fire
ms.
myers
or
discharge
her
because
he
believed
she
was
refusing
the
transfer.
there
was
no
refusal,
and
he
didn't
believe
there
was
a
refusal.
the
district
judge
found
that
he
fired
her
because
of
the
questionnaire,
and
that
leads
us
back
again
to
whether
the
questionnaire
itself
falls
within
protected
speech.
this
court
has
frequently
said
that
the
way
one
is
to
answer
that
is
to
apply
the
pickering
balancing
test.
the
district
judge
did
that.
he
applied
it...
he
took
into
account
all
the
factors,
including
the
possibility
of
some
disruption
of
the
working
relationship,
and
he
found
that
in
fact
the
speech
was
protected.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
no,
it's
not,
justice
o'connor.
i
believe--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--i
believe
the
pickering
balance
includes
findings
of
subsidiary
fact,
but
i
believe
that
ultimately
the--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--a
mixed
question;
i
believe
that's
an
accurate
characterization.
the
court,
after
finding...
the
district
judge,
after
finding
that
the
pickering
balancing
had
been
properly
applied
and
finding
that
it
was
protected,
went
ahead
and
then
applied
the
mount
healthy
test,
and
he
considered,
of
course,
the
reasons
that
mr.
connick
had
put
forward.
he
did
not
disregard
those
reasons,
as
mr.
wessel
argued.
he
considered
those
reasons
and
found
that
in
fact
the
questionnaire
was
the
real
reason,
the
but-for
reason,
and--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
i
believe
they're
all
matters
of
public
concern.
i
believe
they're
all
matters
of
public
concern
because
they
all
relate
to
the
efficient
operation
and
the
morale
of
an
important
governmental
agency.
they're
at
least
as
important,
it
seems
to
me,
as
the
bond
issue
speech
that
was
addressed
by
this
court
in
pickering,
and
they're
more
important,
it
seems
by
any
standard,
than
the
dress
code
communication
that
was
at
issue
in
mount
healthy.
mount
healthy
involved
a
communication
regarding
the
content
of
an
internal
dress
code
in
a
public
school.
now,
if
that's
a
matter
of
public
concern,
it
seems
to
me
the
issues
that
are
addressed
in
this
questionnaire
are
matters
of
public
concern.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
only
in
the
respect
that
it
implicates
another
factor
in
the
pickering
balance,
your
honor.
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
some
kind
of
communications
are
more
disruptive
if
they're
made
in
the
public
forum.
for
example,
if
ms.
myers
had
indeed
broadcast
some
questions
about
the
competency
of
her
supervisors
to
the
public
at
large,
i
think
that
that
would
be
more
disruptive
than
what
she,
far
more
disruptive
than
what
she
did.
and
i
think
a
court
must
take
that
into
account.
so
to
the
extent
that
it
went
to
the
public
at
large,
i
think
it
is
a
factor
to
be
weighed
in
the
pickering
balance,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
a...
that
this
court
has
ever,
and
i
certainly
do
not
think
in
pickering
this
court
intended,
to
draw
any
kind
of
bright
line
between
matters
of
public
concern
and
matters
of
non-public
concern
and
say
matters
of
non-public
concern
are
without
any
protection
whatsoever.
and
i
think
this
court
has
said
the
exact
opposite
on
many
occasions
where
it
has
said--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--it's
not
totally
indifferent.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
it
shouldn't
make
any
difference
on
that.
it
does
make
a
difference,
though,
as
to
the
potential
disruptive
effect.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
the
record
does
not
reflect
that,
your
honor.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
i
believe
this
sort
of
questionnaire
can
be
indeed
beneficial
to
the
workings
of
a
government
bureaucracy.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
the
question
is,
do
you
have
confidence
in
and
would
you
rely
on
the
word
of,
and
then
the
names.
i
don't
believe
that's
a
personal
attack.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
no,
sir.
but
even
if
the
court
were
to
consider
it
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
has
frequently
said
that
public
employees
have
rights
to
communicate
or
to
assemble
and
to
organize
with
regard
to
their
work
in
the
public
sector.
without
being
able
to
communicate
ideas
like,
do
you
think
your
supervisor
is
doing
a
good
job
or
do
you
trust
their
word,
that
right,
that
first
amendment
right
to
organize,
is
meaningless.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
i
know
of
some
private
organizations
that
do,
your
honor,
but
private
organizations
are
not
bound
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
i
think
it
depends
on
the
organization,
your
honor.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
that
is
certainly
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
your
honor,
the
record
does
show
that,
and
the
record
shows--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--the
record
shows
it
was
all
done
on
lunch
hour.
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
your
honor,
i'd
be
happy
to
respond
to
your
question.
i
see
the
red
light
is
on.
but
the
record--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--the
record
shows
that
the
questionnaire
was
prepared
before
working
hours
and
it
was
distributed
starting
at
12:00
o'clock
and--
mr.
george
m.
strickler,
jr.
--shortly
before
12:00
o'clock.
and
it
was
completed
before
1:00
o'clock,
the
distribution
that
there
was,
and
that
she
was
fired
at
2:00
o'clock.
thank
you.
