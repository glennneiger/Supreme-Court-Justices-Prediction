mr.
william
f.
wessel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
case
before
you
today
is
a
case
involving
a
public
employee
who
was
dismissed
from
service
because
of
actions
surrounding
a
job
movement,
that
is,
moving
an
assistant
district
attorney
from
one
section
of
the
court
to
another
section
of
the
court
in
the
orleans
parish
criminal
justice
system.
the
action
to
transfer
the
assistant
district
attorney
was
followed
up
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
circulating
a
questionnaire,
which
is
in
the
records,
which
pertained...
over
90
percent
of
the
questionnaire
pertained
to
matters
surrounding
the
transfer,
and
one
question
pertained
to
a
question
about
the
integrity
or
the
confidence
that
other
assistant
district
attorneys
may
or
may
not
have
had
in
the
supervising
trial
assistant
who
took
part
in
the
decision
to
have
him
transferred.
another
question
in
the
questionnaire
outside
of
the
questions
that
directly
pertained
to
the
transfer
was
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
other
assistant
district
attorneys
felt
pressured
to
engage
in
political
campaigns.
the
central
issue
around
this
case
falls
on
pickering,
decided
by
this
court,
and
pickering
left
us
no
standards
in
a
case
where
a
public
employee
is
terminated
for
voicing
concerns
that
he
could
voice
or
would
voice
as
a
private
citizen
on
matters
of
legitimate
public
concern.
the
court
has
not
left
the
circuits
any
standards
by
which
to
determine
what
is
a
matter
of
legitimate
public
concern.
by
reason
of
that,
the
circuits
have
gone
askew
in
determining
what
is
a
matter
of
public
concern,
and
in
some
instances
have
done
the
balancing
required
by
pickering
in
order
to
determine
what
is
a
matter
of
public
concern.
in
pickering,
of
course,
we
had
a
non-employment
setting
about
a
matter
pertaining
to
a
bond
issue
and
how...
why
the
bond
issue
should
or
should
not
be
voted
upon
by
the
population.
the
teacher
there
voiced
his
concern
in
the
public
media
about
the
bond
issue.
in
givhan,
decided
by...
remanded
by
this
court,
we
had
an
employee
setting
rather
than
a
non-employee
setting,
an
employee
setting
about
racially
discriminatory
policies.
that
matter
was
remanded
by
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
another
reason
for
the
firing
in
that
case.
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
an
employee
setting
again,
rather
than
a
public
setting,
but
we
have
a
questionnaire
pertaining
to
a
private
quarrel
or
petty
bickering
of
the
employee
pertaining
to
a
transfer
of
that
assistant
district
attorney
from
one
section
of
court
to
another
section
of
court.
the
questionnaire
throughout
points
out
the
culmination
of
the
events
that
took
place
prior
to
the
questionnaire
being
circulated,
and
it
is
important
in
that
regard
to
determine...
to
look
at
the
facts
as
they
were
presented
at
the
trial
level.
the
evening
before
the
distribution
of
the
questionnaire,
the
assistant
district
attorney
in
this
case
was
told
that
she
was
going
to
be
transferred
to
another
section
of
court
and
was
given
a
written
memo
to
that
effect.
the
written
memo
was
returned
by
her
to
the
first
assistant
district
attorney
that
evening
with
a
complaint
on
it,
why
didn't
you
tell
me
about
it
before,
and
with
an
indication
that
her
name
was
spelled
wrong.
the
next
morning,
she
had
been
visited
by
the
district
attorney
himself
at
approximately
8:00
or
8:30
in
the
morning,
in
the
courtroom
where
she
had
her
office,
with
a
personal
request
to
acquiesce
in
the
decision
to
transfer
her
from
one
section
of
court
to
the
other.
the
district
attorney
had
come
from
home,
had
not
planned
to
work
that
day.
he
was
home
with
a
sick
wife
at
that
time.
and
he
made
a
personal
request
to
her.
thereafter,
he
returned
to
his
office
to
pack
his
briefcase
to
return
home.
he
was
informed
by
the
first
assistant
that
the
assistant
district
attorney,
ms.
myers,
had
told
him
she
would
not
accept
the
transfer
and
would
not
move
to
the
other
section
of
court.
this
was
an
intervening
event
that
took
place
between
his
personal
request
of
ms.
myers
in
her
section
of
court
that
morning.
later
on
that
morning,
at
about
noon,
the
first
assistant
called
the
district
attorney
and
told
him,
ms.
myers
is
circulating
a
questionnaire,
and
she
is
creating
a
mini-insurrection,
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
about
it?
whereupon,
mr.
connick,
the
district
attorney,
returned
to
the
office
and
he
inquired
of
the
questionnaire,
was
informed
by
the
chief
of
trials
under
whom
ms.
myers
was
to
be
transferred
that
he
had
spoken
to
ms.
myers
and
she
told
him
she
wasn't
going
to
accept
the
transfer,
that
she
was
going
to
quit
rather
than
accept
the
transfer.
the
questionnaire
was
then
circulated,
and
mr.
connick,
of
course,
had
returned
to
the
office,
and
at
that
point
in
time
he
informed
her
that
she
was
fired.
ms.
myers
testified
and
mr.
connick
testified
that
she
was
being
fired
for
two
reasons,
for
refusing
to
accept
the
transfer
and
refusing...
for
refusing
to
accept
the
transfer
and
for
having
circulated
the
questionnaire
with
a...
or
a
question
in
the
questionnaire
being
particularly
offensive
to
the
district
attorney
at
the
time
pertaining
to
the
integrity
of
the
six
chiefs,
chief
assistants
who
had
participated
in
the
decision
to
transfer
the
individual.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
mr.
justice,
there
was
testimony
that
the
chief...
two
chiefs
of
trials,
the
chief
of
screening,
and
the
training
officer
as
well
as
the
first
assistant.
the
structure
in
descending
order
was
the
first
assistant,
the
chief
of
the
screening
division,
that
is,
the
intake
division,
two
chiefs
of
trials,
that
is,
the
operational
trial
under
which
ms.
myers
was
operating
at
that
particular
time,
and
the
training
officer.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
mr.
justice.
she
was
being
moved
from
one
chief
of
trials
to
another
chief
of
trials.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
mr.
justice.
there
is
certainly
challenge
insofar...
in
two
respects,
that
the...
insofar
as
the
mount
healthy
but
for
inquiry,
as
to
the
inquiry
where
there
is
a
dual
reason
for
the
firing,
the
court
below
did
not
address
itself
to
the
dual
reasons.
the
court
below
found
the
real
reason,
as
he
said.
the
trial
court
said
the
real
reason,
but
did
not
inquire
either
in
terms
of
balancing
or
in
terms
of
the
but
for
test
of
mount
healthy,
as
to
the
other
reason,
the
non-first
amendment
reason,
i.e.,
the
setting
in
which
the
questionnaire
was
distributed,
the
transfer
of
the
assistant
from
one
section
of
court
to
the
other.
the
pickering,
as
i
earlier
pointed
out,
the
pickering
situation
was
a
one-reason
firing,
not
a
two-reason
firing.
there
was
no
other
reason.
there
was
one
reason
there.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
well,
mr.
justice,
there
are
two
problems
with
that.
number
one,
he
didn't
address
the
other
reason.
number
two,
he
didn't
inquire...
he
did
not
do
the
threshold
inquiry
of
pickering
insofar
as
whether
this
questionnaire
was
a
matter
of
public
concern.
the...
that
is
what--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--i
would
say
that
is
corrects,
mr.
justice,
in
that
regard.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
clearly
erroneous
for
several
reasons.
number
one,
he
didn't
address
the
factual
underlying
reasons.
there
was
no...
he
addressed
the
motivation
of
the
district
attorney
without
addressing
the
motivation
of
the
employee
who
circulated
the
questionnaire.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
my
complaint
is
that
he...
by
not
addressing
it,
he
did
decide
it
the
wrong
way,
and
of
course
i
recognize
the
decision
of
facts
on
the
factual
underlying
basis
is
not
reviewable,
but
the
ultimate
question
as
to
the
protected
activity
would
be.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that's
correct.
i
would
yield
on
that
point,
that
that
was
where
the
trial
judge
was
coming
from
at
the
time--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--but
it
does
not
appear
that
he
did.
excuse
me,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
well,
i
would
think
the
other
reason
for...
the
other
reason
for
the
firing,
yes.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
would
not
be
arguing
that
except--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--my
arguing,
mr....
my
argument,
mr.
justice,
is
that
you
can't
in
this
sort
of
situation
under
mount
healthy--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--correct.
that
is
part
of
it,
mr.
justice,
but
the
other
thing
is
that
in
a
dual
firing,
dual
reason
firing
situation,
you
can't
abstract
out
of
the
situation
the
first
amendment
aspect
of
it,
because
you
then
end
up,
as
this
court
said
in
mount
healthy,
where
the
employee
by
reason
of...
by
reason
of
engaging
in
a
first
amendment
activity
after
the
real
reason
becomes...
there's
a
windfall
to
the
employee
by
grabbing
the
microphone
at
the
press
conference,
as
was
done
in
butler
versus
hamilton,
in
the
tenth
circuit,
and
as
was
done
by
the
employee
in
this
case,
where
you
go
to
the
press
to
cover
up
your
own
inadequacies
or
the
true
reasons
for
the
firing.
so,
in...
you
don't
have--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--he
found--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
he
found
that
it
was
a
single
motive
case,
but
under
the--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--and
even
under
the
single
motive...
but
even
under
the
single
motive
case,
the
question
has
to
be
addressed
as
to
whether
the
subject
is
a
matter
of
public
concern.
now,
that
has
been
decided
in
the
various
circuits
by
judicial
hunch.
it
has
been
decided
in
this
case
by
judicial
hunch.
there
are
no
guidelines
whatsoever
to
determine
what
are
matters
of
public
concern
when
an
employee,
a
public
employee
is
fired.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice,
and
the
first
and
primary
point
is
that
the...
he
reached
the
balancing
or
he
reached
the
real
reason,
but
without
addressing...
the
trial
court,
i
am
talking
about,
did
not
address
the
public
importance
of
the
message
or
the
test
that
should
have
been
applied
insofar
as
determining
whether
it
was
a
matter
of
public
concern.
it
was,
in
this
case,
and
this
is
where
the
results
throughout
the
circuits
differ.
in
the
lindsey
case
arising
out
of
georgia
where
a
teacher
was
fired
for
faculty,
administration
criticism
in
the
form
of
a
questionnaire,
the
fifth
circuit
takes...
comes
to
the
conclusion
or
dictates
the
conclusion
that
that
is
a
matter
of
public
concern,
but
in
the
tenth...
or
the
seventh
circuit,
in
the
clark
versus
holmes
situation,
you
had
pretty
much
the
same
situation
with
a
teacher,
again,
determining
the
course
content
and
the
counseling
and
criticizing
it,
and
the
seventh
circuit
says
this
is
not
a
matter
of
public
concern.
so,
the
threshold
question
of
pickering
is
very
rarely
answered
except
by
some
fiat
of
what
is
public
concern,
because
there
are
no
standards
enunciated.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
it's
a
legal
question,
and
it's
the
ultimate
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
expression
is
first
amendment
protected
or
whether
it
is
really
a
private
quarrel
between...
involving
the
employee
as
an
employee.
the
test
that
should
be
applied
and
which
we
are
urging
the
court
in
determining
the
threshold
question
comes
under
the
schmidt
case
and
the
clark
v.
holmes
case,
and
that
is
really...
the
court
should
determine,
does
the
expression
reveal
concerns
of
the
individual
solely
as
an
employee,
or
also
as
an
interested
citizen?
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is...
that
is--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--not
necessarily,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
not
only
could
the
determination
or
should
the
determination
have
been
made
upon
the
whole
context
of
the
transfer
with
the
questionnaire,
but
even
in
the
absence
of
that,
if
the
real
reason
was
the
questionnaire,
if
the
real
reason
was
the
questionnaire,
is
the
questionnaire
and
the
circulation
of
the
questionnaire
a
protected
activity?
is
it
protected
under
pickering?
is
she
voicing
concern
as
a
citizen
on
matters
of
public
concern?
and
the
threshold
question
therefore
has...
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
guideline
as
to
what
is
a
matter
of
public
concern,
and
that
has
not
been
answered
by
the
court,
and
that...
and
that
is
the
question
that
i
am
addressing
at
this
point.
is
she
talking
as
an
employee
about
matters
concerning
her
employment,
or
does
the
questionnaire
address
issues
that
a
citizen
at
large
would
be
interested
in
in
returning
the,
say,
the
district
attorney
to
office?
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
think
there
is
no
question
at
all
about
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
is
correct,
but
the
setting,
the
setting
has
been
ignored
in
the
findings
of
the
trial
court.
the
setting...
the
setting
of
the
transfer
has
been
ignored,
and
it
centers
and
focuses
on
the
questionnaire.
the
findings
by
the
trial
court
center
and
focus
on
the
questionnaire,
but
the
setting
is
important
either
under
determining
the
content
of
the
questionnaire
vis-a-vis
what
was
going
on
in
the
office
at
that
time,
that
is,
his
absolute
right
to
transfer
her,
and
secondly,
on
the
balancing
aspect,
on
his
need
to
have
confidence
and
loyalty
in
his
supervising
assistants,
for
example.
on
that
balancing
aspect
alone,
there
is
a
need
to
look
at
the
underlying
aspects
of
what
was
going
on,
because
the
integrity
of
those
assistants
who
partook
in
the
decision
to
transfer
was
being
questioned
by
that
one
question
in
the
questionnaire,
and
remember,
every
question
in
the
questionnaire
except
for
the
question
pertaining
to
the
reaction
as
to
participation
in
political
campaigns,
every
question
pertained
to
her
gripes
pertaining
to
the
transfer,
and
that
underlying
basis
in
fact
was
necessary
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
content
was
in
fact
matters
of
public
concern,
and
secondly,
whether
the
balancing
required
by
pickering,
the
interest
in
furnishing
the
services
to
the
public,
was
there.
we
have
no...
the
public...
certainly
the
public
is
not
interested
in
which
assistant
district
attorney
worked
in
section
a
or
section
i
of
the
criminal
district
court.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
think,
mr.
justice,
at
that
point
the
balance
in
pickering
should
be
broadened,
but
where
you
had
eleven
out
of
thirteen,
or
eleven
or
twelve
out
of
thirteen
questions
that
pertained
solely
to
the
transfer
policy,
and
one
was
thrown
in
as
to
whether
or
not
the
assistants
felt
that
they
were
pressured
into
political
campaigns.
the
point
is
that
ms.
myers--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--well--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--i
think
in
the
abstract,
had
the
transfer
not
been
involved,
then
the
questionnaire
might
have
been
a
protected
activity,
pertaining
to
one
question.
but
here
you
have
one
question
out
of
thirteen,
and
it
is
difficult
to
answer
that.
in
this
context,
i
say
no.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that
one
question
may
have
been.
actually...
actually,
that
itself
has
to
do
with
the
operations
of
the
office,
whether
or
not
the
assistants
were
asked
to
participate--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--i
do
not
believe
the
voters
would
turn
mr.
connick
out
of
office
or
vote
him
into
office--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
don't
think
so,
not
in
the
non-civil
service
context,
and
this
is
where
we
are.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no.
i
would
say
that
under
those
sort
of
circumstances,
where
that
was
the
sole
question,
in
that
respect
it
would
be
protected,
and
it
would
be--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--it
would
be
a
matter
of
public
concern.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
justice
o'connor,
it
would
be
difficult
to
answer
that
in
the
abstract,
and
i
would
probably
have
to
yield
on
the
point.
these
things
just
don't
happen
in
a
vacuum
in
that
regard,
but
on
your
question
as
it
is
posed,
i
think
i
would
probably
have
to
yield
on
the
point.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
so
that
once
the
determination
is
made
that
the
subject
matter
was
one
in
which
the
public
or
the
employee
has
an
interest
as
a
citizen
to
explain
to
the
citizenry
or
to
his
fellow
employees,
given
the
givhan
case,
that
the
inquiry
does
not
stop
at
that
point,
and
that
the
balancing
that
is
required
by
pickering
is
under
these
circumstances,
this
time,
and
this
manner,
and
these
circumstances,
was
this...
this
expression
contained
in
this
questionnaire,
is
it
offset
by
the
perceptions
of
the
district
attorney
at
the
time,
and
whether
his
perceptions
were
reasonable
in
terms
of
requiring
loyalty
and
confidence
in
his
supervisors
and
whether
or
not
he
was...
it
was
hindering
his
concept,
if
they
are
based
on
reasonable
grounds
of
his
efficient
delivery
of
the
public
services,
and
this
circulation
was
taking
place
in
a
courthouse
where
all
the
assistant
district
attorneys
were
working.
it
was
during
the
time
of
their
work,
for
the
most
part,
except
one
in
a
luncheon
room
elsewhere,
but
during
the
time
of
their
work,
going
into
the
screening
division,
where
the
intake
division
is...
or
intake
of
cases
of
over
13,000
a
year
are
coming
in,
and
in
the
trial
division,
where
there
are
two
assistants
assigned
from
each
section
of
court
to
perform
the
trials
that
are
going
on
and
the
motions
that
are
being
heard
in
every
one
of
those
sections
of
court
during
that
day.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
and...
excuse
me,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
none
whatsoever,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
transfer
was
indicated
on
the
week
before,
culminating
on
a
friday.
on
the
monday
evening,
in
the
presence
of
the
district
attorney
and
the
first
assistant,
she
was
told
she
was
going
to
be
transferred.
later
that
evening,
a
memo
was
given
to
her,
a
written
memo,
showing
her
new
transfer.
the
memo
then
was
thrown
back
on
the
first
assistant's
desk
and
the
questionnaire
was
compiled
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
the
next
day,
and
circulated
around
11:00
or
12:00
o'clock
that
day.
the
questionnaire
came
about
as
a
result
of
the
decision
to
transfer,
and
the
personal
request
of
the
district
attorney
to
ask
her
to
accede
to
that
transfer
that
morning.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
definitely
found
that.
the
assistant
district
attorney
definitely
testified
to
that,
and
she...
and
that
was
the
sequence
of
events.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
mr.
chief
justice,
the
district
attorney
testified
and
the
assistant
testified
that
when
she
was
fired,
she
was
told
by
the
district
attorney,
you
are
being
fired
for
your
refusal
to
accept
the
transfer,
and
i
resent
the
implications
of
question
number
10
or
11
in
the
questionnaire
pertaining
to
the
integrity
of
the
supervisors
who
partook
in
the
decision.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
there
was
no
regulation.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
judge
was
talking,
and
we
were
talking
about
whether
or
not
ms.
myers
enjoyed
a
direct
personal
confidential
relationship
to
the
district
attorney
under
the
pickering
test.
that
is,
i
believe,
what
the
court
was
addressing
itself
to,
and
what--
mr.
william
f.
wessel
--she
had
handed
out
numerous
memorandums
before,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
and
had
never
been
questioned
before.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
we
originally
argued
that
in
our
petition
for
cert,
mr.
justice.
by
mistake
on
my
part,
it
was
left
out...
a
footnote
was
left
out
referring
to
that
case.
we
had
indicated
that
in
these
sort
of
instances,
as
in
the
case,
i
believe,
in
the
seventh
circuit,
in
the
county,
had
indicated
that
in
a
dual
firing
or
dual
reason
situation,
that
the
burden
of
the
appointing
authority
should
be
no
more
than
to
explain
with
reasonable
grounds
for
the
firing,
and
should
be
not
a
shifting
of
burden
as
dictated
by
mount
healthy.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
no,
we
did
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
yes.
the
appeal
was...
the
initial
judgment
from
the
trial
court
was
granting
the
attorney
fees,
but
the
quantum
was
not
decided
at
that
time
by
the
trial
court.
the
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit
was
based
on
the
entire
judgment.
that
is
the
removal
and
the
reinstatement
issue,
the
back
pay
issue,
the
quantum
for
the
damages
issue,
and
the
question
of
attorney
fees.
the
amount
had
not
been
determined
until
the
case
was
pending
before
the
fifth
circuit,
but
it
was
argued
before
the
fifth
circuit,
and
briefed
before
the
fifth
circuit,
the
actual
question
of
attorney
fees.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
amount
was
in
a
separate
judgment,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
the
issue
of...
no
appeal
was
taken
as
to
the
amount.
no
question
as
to
the
quantum...
no
appeal
would
have
been
taken
or
was
taken
from
the
quantum.
the
issue
of
the
fact
of
the
attorney
fees
as
it
was
granted
by
the
trial
judge
was
appealed
from,
and
it
was
briefed
to
the
fifth
circuit.
in
other
words,
we
didn't
object
ultimately
to
the
amount
determined
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
william
f.
wessel
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
bond
issue
in
pickering
may
have
been
determinative
of
whether
or
not
that
board
of
education
was
going
to
be
reelected.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
sheila
myers
was
moved
from
one
section
of
the
court
to
the
other
or
her
complaints
about
that
would
never
under
any
imagination
determine
whether
or
not
mr.
connick
would
be
reelected.
the
public
is
not
concerned
about
who
is
furnishing
and
the
efficiency
of
the
services
in
any
particular
section
of
the
court.
they're
interested
in
the
man
on
top
and
whether
or
not
he's
getting
the
job
done
in
terms
of
getting
the
cases
decided
and
his
policies
pertaining
to
plea
bargaining
and
his
policies
pertaining
to
a
speedy
trial.
and
that
i
think
is
the
issue
before
the
court
relative
to
this
questionnaire.
