justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wessel,
does
the
record
show
what
the
structure
of
the
district
attorney's
office
was
with
respect
to
the
chain
of
authority
below
the
district
attorney
himself?
you
just
said
there
were
six
chiefs--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
ms.
myers
served
under
one
of
the
two
chiefs
of
trials?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
line
of
authority
went
from
the
chief
of
trials
to
the
first
assistant
and
then
to
the
district
attorney?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wessel,
i
have
a
little
trouble
understanding
your
position
in
the
light
of
your
responses
to
justice
stevens'
question.
is
it
your
complaint
basically
that
he
didn't
address
the
questions,
or
that
he
decided
it
the
wrong
way?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
in
a
negligence
case
one
side
is
arguing
that
something
happened
on
friday,
and
the
other
is
arguing
it
happened
on
saturday,
and
there
is
a
bench
trial,
and
the
judge
says,
i
find
it
happened
on
saturday.
now,
he
says
nothing
about
it
not
having
happened
on
friday,
but
certainly
that
would
be
a
rejection
of
the
claim
that
it
happened
on
friday.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
separate
inquiry,
isn't
it,
from--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
you
dealt
with
the
motivation
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wessel,
when
you
say
that
something
is
a
matter
of
public
concern,
that,
i
take
it,
is
not
the
end
of
your
argument
on
the
point,
because
you
say
even
if
it
is
a
matter
of
public
concern,
there
remains
the
pickering
balancing
test
to
be
struck.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
strickler?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
questionnaire
had
contained
only
question
number
10?
do
you
think
the
district
court
would
have
found...
made
exactly
the
same
findings
in
connection
with
what
you
are
now
referring
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
testify
that
it
wasn't?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
they
weren't
asked,
i
would
think
the
implication
from
their
testimony
was
simply
that
it
wasn't
asked.
i
don't
think
you
can
draw
a
negative
inference
or
one
way
or
the
other
on
that.
would
you
defend
the
district
court
judgment
here
if
in
fact...
on
the
basis
you
are
defending
it
now
if
in
fact
only
this
question
10,
do
you
have
confidence
and
would
you
rely
on
the
word
of,
listing
the
six
supervisory
people?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
he
have
consulted
with
them?
if
he
felt
that
the
ability
of
his
own
senior
staff
to
supervise
people
further
down
the
line
was
in
jeopardy,
i
mean,
that
was
a
judgment,
i
would
think,
for
him
to
make.
i
don't
think
he
has
to
go
ask
the
senior
staff,
do
you
feel
your
authority
is
undermined.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
chief
justice
taft
long
ago
said
that
judges
should
not
rejected
as
judges
what
they
know
as
people,
and
i
think
there
is
an
element
of
that
in
the
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
call
your
attention
to
one
comment
of
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
on
the
relief
granted,
and
that's
on
page
a-20,
where
he's
speaking
of
injunctive
relief.
the
opening
phrase
is,
"considering
the
acrimonious
circumstances
surrounding
plaintiff's
departure
from
the
district
attorney's
office.
"
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
i
take
it
there
were
two
sources
of
acrimony,
one,
her
resort
to
judicial
remedy,
and
two,
the
circumstances
surrounding
her
departure
from
the
district
attorney's
office.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
in
mount
healthy
the
employee
went
public
with
the
thing,
as
i
recall.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
on
a
cincinnati
radio
station.
doesn't
that
add
a
little
different
dimension
to
the
case
than
when
it's
purely
internal?
