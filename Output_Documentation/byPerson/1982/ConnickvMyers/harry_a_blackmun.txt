mr.
wessel,
your
opponent
makes
a
good
bit
out
of
texas
department
against
burdine,
a
case
you
did
not
cite.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
that
mean
that
you
concede
that
burdine
doesn't
affect
whatever
the
standards
were
in
the
mount
healthy
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
had
the
privilege
of
filing
a
reply
brief
and
didn't--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--did
you
raise
the
burdine
issue
before
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
that
was
in
a
separate
judgment,
wasn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
from
which
no
appeal
was
taken.
