justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
when
you
say
prima
facie
case,
what
exactly
do
you
mean?
do
you
mean
enough
to
get
by
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
if
the
case
is
tried?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
then
it
is
something
more
than
a
motion
to
get
by
a
directed
verdict.
i
don't
think
it
is.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district
court
can
also
rule
on
a
41(b)
motion
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiff's
case
that
assuming
that
i
were
to
believe
the
plaintiff's
witnesses,
there
is
enough
to
get
by
a
motion...
there
is
enough
to
enter
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
if
the
defendant
puts
on
no
case,
but
he
might
nonetheless,
if
the
defendant
chose
to
put
on
no
case,
after
having
denied
a
motion
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
i
should
think
still
enter
a
judgment
for
the
defendant
when
it
came
to
his
duty
to
weigh
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
no
other
branch
of
the
law
where
there's
been
a
trial,
where
the
plaintiff
puts
on
evidence,
the
defendant
puts
on
evidence,
the
judge
enters
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
would
something
on
appeal
be
talked
about
as
failure
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case.
do
you
think
our
decisions
make
the
title
vii
litigation
unique
for
some
reason?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
does
the
government
place
any
reliance
on
the
fact
that
this
case
was
a
promotional
decision
rather
than
an
original
entry
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
some
difference
at
any
rate?
if
you
think
of
the
ordinary
mcdonnell
douglas
type
hiring,
you
have
presumably
an
indeterminate
number
of
vacancies
and
minimum
qualifications,
and
the
inference
is
from
business
practice
that
the
first
people
who
come
along
and
meet
those
minimum
qualifications
are
going
to
be
hired,
but
with
a
promotional
decision,
you
frequently
have
only
one
vacancy,
and
a
finite
number
of
applicants
within
the
organization.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
mr.
greenberg,
supposing
that
the
plaintiff
has
put
on
its
case
in
a
title
vii
action,
and
there
is
a
rule
41
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
case.
is
it
permissible
for
the
judge
to
say
at
that
time
there
is
evidence
here
from
which
certainly
a
reasonable
person
could
infer
actual
discriminatory
intent
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
but
i
can
weigh
the
evidence
at
this
point
and
in
that
capacity
i
just
don't
choose
to
draw
that
inference.
i
think
it
is
equally
reasonable
to
draw
an
inference
there
was
no
discriminatory
intent.
so
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
granted.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
the
trial
judge--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
he
doesn't
choose
to
draw
the
inference
from
the...
of
a
state
of
mind
from
facts
which
could
support
that
inference
but
really
don't
compel
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
think
that
if
a
witness
simply
testifies
to
facts
which
could
support
an
inference,
that
the
inference
becomes
mandatory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
you
see
title
vii
litigation
as
being
kind
of
unique,
i
take
it,
and
not--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
ordinary
burden
between
the
parties.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
other
traditional
rules
of
evidence
would
simply
be
a
permissible
inference
in
other
branches
of
litigation?
is
a
presumption
in
title
vii
litigation
that
carries
one
beyond
a
negative
finding
by
the
district
judge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
in
a
hypothetical
case
there
had
been
three
whites
appointed
to
vacancies
and
no
blacks,
and
there
is
testimony
from
the
supervisor
that
this
is
how
he
went
about
filling
those
posts,
and
both
of
those
situations
are
before
the
district
judge
on
a
rule
41(b)
motion.
he
says
to
himself,
this
filling
the
three
slots
with
whites
rather
than
blacks
when
they
are
equally
qualified
certainly
would
support
inference
of
discrimination,
but
i
am
satisfied
that
the
supervisor
is
telling
the
truth,
and
to
me
that
negates
the
inference
of
discrimination,
so
i
am
going
to
grant
the
rule
41(b)
motion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
he
gave
an
explanation
as
to
why
each
of
the
whites
were
promoted
in
preference
to
blacks
that
satisfied
the
trial
judge
that
it
was
not
a
discriminatory
animus.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
isn't
there
something
perhaps
inconsistent
between
mcdonnell
douglas
and
burdine
and
perhaps
fernco
on
the
one
hand
and
the
principle
that
in
a
bench
trial
on
a
motion...
rule
41(b)
motion
the
trial
judge
can
weigh
the
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
comes
to
us
by
way
of
certiorari
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
harold
aikens
sued
the
petitioner,
the
united
states
postal
service
for
discrimination
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
aikens
was
black,
contended
that
the
postal
service
discriminatorily
refused
to
promote
him
to
higher
positions
in
a
washington,
d.c.,
post
office
where
he
worked
since
1937.
the
post
office
insisted
that
they
had
not
discriminated
against
him.
after
full
trial,
the
district
court
found
for
the
postal
service
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reversed
saying
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
thinking
that
direct
evidence
of
discrimination
was
required
and
it
also
discussed
at
some
length
the
prima
facie
case
presumptions
which
are
derived
from
our
earlier
cases.
we
granted
certiorari
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
court.
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
finding
that
no
present
--
no
direct
evidence
of
discrimination
was
required.
discrimination
cases
like
other
suits
can
be
proved
by
either
direct
or
circumstantial
evidence.
but
we
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
incorrect
in
its
dealing
with
the
presumptions
which
are
discussed
in
its
opinion.
in
fact,
we
have
some
doubt
why
the
parties
and
the
court
should
be
talking
about
the
questions
of
presumptions
at
this
stage
of
the
case.
a
full
trial
was
been
completed
and
our
cases
in
that
situation
instruct
trial
judges
to
decide
the
ultimate
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
discrimination
in
the
case.
we
therefore
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
with
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
brennan
joins.
justice
marshall
concurs
in
the
judgment.
