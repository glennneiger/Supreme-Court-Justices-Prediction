mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
real
question
before
this
court
is
whether
on
this
record
the
plaintiff
has
made
a
prima
facie
case,
and
we
submit
that
he
clearly
did
so
in
four
different
ways,
and
that
the
judgment
should
clearly
be
affirmed.
indeed,
i
would
suggest
the
record
is
so
clear
that
it
is...
and
so
unlike
the
assertion
of
facts
in
the
question
presented,
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
dismiss
the
writ
of
certiorari
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
and
i
would
like
to
recite
now
the
four
different
ways
in
which
the
plaintiff
made
his
prima
facie
case.
the
four
positions
for
which
the
plaintiff
applied
and
concerning
which
he
claimed
he
had
been
discriminatorily
denied
promotion
were
temporary
appointments
or
details
which
were
not
posted.
people
didn't
apply
for
them.
appointments
were
made
at
the
initiative
and
the
discretion
of
the
supervisors.
all
these
four
appointments
were
within
the
control
or
subject
to
the
influence
of
the
postmaster,
carlton
beall
or
"belle".
i
am
not
certain
how
to
pronounce
it.
and
i
beg
the
court's
indulgence,
because
i
am
going
to
use
a
term
which
i
use
advisedly,
but
it
is
based
upon
uncontradicted
testimony.
beall
was
a
racist,
and
there
is
really
no
two
ways
about
that.
i
will
just
quote
some
of
the
testimony.
three
witnesses
testified
concerning
beall,
two
black
and
one
white.
beall
said,
is
supposed
to
have
said,
is
testified
to
have
said
of
blacks.
"all
they
want
to
do
is
lay
around
and
breed
like
yard
dogs
and
collect
relief
checks.
"
it
was
said
of
him
by
this
witness
that,
"he
was
operating
on
an
1865
concept.
"
"he
would
only
want
black
janitors.
"
"he
very
reluctantly
gave
any
ground
as
far
as
i
could
see.
"
"i
dealt
with
him
quite
frequently,
and
while
we
didn't
always
agree,
i
think
he
had
a
contempt
for
black
people.
"
"i
still
think
he
has.
"
another
witness
testified
of
beall
that
he
said
of
black
people,
"you
know,
they
don't
have
to
sit
in
the
back
of
the
bus
any
more.
"
and
that
he
testified
concerning
black
people
as
"that
crowd".
furthermore,
it
was
testified
that
he
frequently
made
sarcastic
comments
about
this
particular
plaintiff,
testifying...
i
mean
stating
that
this
particular
plaintiff,
who
had
a
great
deal
of
education,
that
is,
a
master's
degree
and
three
years
towards
a
ph.d.,
making
remarks
about
his
education.
now,
beall
was
a
witness
for
the
government.
if
anyone
could
deny
such
testimony
made
about
him,
he
certainly
would.
beall
testified
and
did
not
deny
a
word
of
the
testimony
of
these
three
witnesses,
and
i
submit
that
focusing
solely
on
the
issue
that
is
before
this
court
as
to
whether
one
made
a
prima
facie
case,
that
a
prima
facie
case
is
made
when
it
is
demonstrated
that
the
person
in
whose
sole
control
the
promotions
were,
and
who
never
promoted
a
black
person,
but
promoted
29
or
30
whites,
made
remarks
of
that
sort,
and
was
that
kind
of
a
person.
the
second
way
in
which
a
prima
facie
case
was
made
was
that
there
was
an
immense
statistical
disparity
between
the
representation
of
blacks
in
the
work
force
and
whites
in
the
work
force
and
blacks
and
whites
in
supervisory
positions.
whites
were
14
percent
of
the
work
force
in
the
post
office
during
the
period
in
question.
they
occupied
almost
50
percent
of
the
supervisory
positions.
the
likelihood
of
this
occurring
by
chance
i
made
an
effort
of
calculating.
it
is
something
like
one
in
a
quintillion.
this,
too,
we
submit,
constitutes
a
prima
facie
case.
in
a
total
range
of
cases
involving
jury
discrimination,
employment
discrimination,
voting
discrimination,
this
court
has
looked
at
statistics,
and
has
concluded
from
statistics
far
less
persuasive
than
these,
far
less
overwhelming
than
these--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--i
don't
think
that's
an
adequate
explanation,
but
the
question
is,
have
we
made
a
prima
facie
case,
and
if
there
is
indeed
such
an
explanation,
they
are
free
to
come
across
and
make
it,
but--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--the
statistics
were,
as
of,
i
think,
1974,
and
the
act
was
passed
in
1964,
made
applicable
to
the
post
office
in
1972.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
may
be,
but
i
think
the
issue
before
this
court
is,
given
such
overwhelming
statistics,
is
some
explanation
called
for,
and
that
is
the
issue
on
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
the
same...
a
week
after
the
act
was
passed--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--would
that
make
a
prima
facie
case?
well,
perhaps
not,
but
this
is
two
years
after--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--this
is
two
years
after
the
act
was
passed,
and
indeed,
there
may
be
a
perfectly
plausible
explanation
for
it.
i
seriously
doubt
that
there
is,
but
i
think
it
is
up
to
the
government
to
make
it,
and
the
issue
is,
was
there
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
sometimes.
i
don't
know
how
often,
but
sometimes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
teamsters,
there
is...
there
is
a
long
footnote
which
discusses
the
use
of
prima
facie
case...
of
statistics
making
a
prima
facie
case
in
employment
discrimination
cases.
i
think
if
i
am
correct
it
refers
to
disparate
treatment
cases,
but
i
wouldn't
swear
to
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
know.
it
shows
it
as
of
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
probably
was
worse
at
the
time
of
the...
at
the
time
that
act
was
passed
than
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
i
don't
think
anyone
has
suggested
that.
the
question
is,
what
do
you
do
with
an
applicant
who
applies
for
a
job
at
the
time
after
the
act
was
passed
that
makes
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
this
plaintiff
was
applying
for
an
opening.
there
was
a
vacancy.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
they
don't
bear
on
that
point.
but
there
were
openings
continuously
occurring.
there
were
many
openings
occurring
in
the
post
office.
there
apparently
was
a
great
deal
of
mobility
there.
once
the
act
has
been
passed,
then
the
act
of
course
applies
to
those
openings.
i
don't
think
anyone
has
ever
suggested--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--i
can't
give
you
the
exact
date.
certainly
it
was
after
the
act
was
passed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
have
to
check
on
the
date
of
those
three
positions.
i
might
say
as
to
those
positions
that
whites
who
were
promoted
above
them
also
had
not
occupied
those
positions,
and
some
of
them
had
declined
comparable
positions.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
the
sense
of
demonstrating
the
mental--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--well,
i
agree
with
it
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
require
the
demonstration
of
a
mental
operation,
but
it
can
be
demonstrated
out
of
factual
circumstances
giving
rise
to
an
inference
of
that,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
giving
rise
to
that
inference,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
you
ultimately
have
to
show
that
in
the
disparate
treatment
case,
but
you
don't
have
to
show
that
someone
was
thinking,
you
know,
syllogistically
thought
that
i
am
not
going
to
appoint
this
person
because
he
is
black,
and
demonstrate
that
that
is
what
went
on
in
his
head.
mr.
jack
greenberg
because
that
can
be
derived
from
external
circumstances.
i
guess
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing,
really.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
yes.
you
don't
need
direct
evidence.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
it
means
what
we
have
just
discussed
it
means,
yes,
i
disagree
with
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
the
judge
doesn't
believe
the
plaintiff's
witnesses?
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law
under
mcdonnell
douglas,
burdine,
and
sweeney
and
the
other
cases,
he
is
compelled
to
draw
that
inference
if
he
believed...
unless
he
disbelieves
the
witnesses.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
that's
what
mcdonnell
douglas
says.
i
think
mcdonnell
douglas...
mcdonnell
douglas
is
a
rule,
as
i
understand
it,
and
it
was
reiterated
in
burdine,
and
if
i
recall
correctly,
in
footnote
7,
that
if
the
evidence
called
for
in
the
mcdonnell
douglas
case
is
presented,
it
then
creates
a
presumption
that
there
has
been
discrimination,
which
presumption
is
rebuttable,
but
if
not
rebutted,
then
the
judgment
must
be
granted
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
presumptions...
i
think
presumptions
arise
and
are
deferred
to
in
all
branches
of
the
law.
res
ipsa
loquitur
is
a
presumption.
in
antitrust
cases,
there
are
presumptions.
in...
rights
cases,
there
are
presumptions.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
the
negative
finding
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
he
disbelieves
the
witnesses,
then
the
testimony
is
not
worth
anything,
but
if
there
is
testimony
which
he
believes
and
a
demonstration
of
facts
which
he
asserts
to
have
occurred,
then
there
is
a
presumption.
if
the
elevator
falls
down
the
shaftway,
that
doesn't
really
prove
that
the
elevator
company
was
negligent.
the
law,
however,
says
that
he
is
unless
he
can
prove
that
he
wasn't.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
want
to
know
what
it
was
that
satisfied
him.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
now
you
are
posing
a
case
in
which
the
trial
judge
was
satisfied
to
the
contrary,
but
if
a
black
applied
for
a
job
or
a
woman
applied
for
a
job
and
was
rejected,
and
the
job
was
then
filled
by
a
member
of
a
non-protected
group,
the
rule
in
mcdonnell
douglas,
as
reiterated
in
burdine,
which
is...
let
me
come
to
burdine
just
for
a
moment.
burdine
is
precisely
this
case.
burdine
was
the
case
in
which
a
black
woman
applied
for
a
job.
people
whom
she
trained
had
been
promoted
above
here,
and
this
court
and...
this
court
held
that
she
had
made
a
prima
facie
case.
on
a
weighing
of
all
of
the
evidence,
it
was
found
that
she
had
not
carried
her
burden
and
she
lost,
but
as
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
she
made
a
prima
facie
case,
that
is
precisely
the
issue
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
aikens
made
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
no.
let
me
just
go
into
the
details
of
this
case
and
explain
to
you
how
there
is
nothing
inconsistent.
in
this
particular
case,
we
submit
that
plaintiff
made
a
prima
facie
case.
the
supervisory
positions
were
in
the
control
of
a
racist,
and
it
is
a
term
i
don't
hesitate
to
use,
because
it
is
uncontradicted
on
the
record.
the
statistical
disparity
was
enormous.
this
plaintiff,
and
i
hadn't
come
to
this
yet,
was
not
only
qualified,
as
it
has
been
asserted.
he
was
extraordinarily
well
qualified.
all
his
supervisory
ratings
were
extremely
high.
he
had
been
recommended
for
the
job
of
postmaster.
he
had
been
recommended
for
other
high
positions.
and
then
we
have
the
critical
mass
of
all
of
these
factors
taken
together.
these
shouldn't
be
seen
in
isolation.
when
they
are
seen
together,
that
makes
a
prima
facie
case,
we
submit.
okay.
the
judge
then
wants
to
hear
what
it
is
that
the
government's
witnesses
have
to
say
to
indicate
that
there
was
no
racial
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
whites
over
the
plaintiff
in
the
government's
case.
the
government
put
on
three
or
four
witnesses.
they
all
testified
about
a
position
which
is
not
in
issue
here,
that
of
postmaster.
it
had
been
an
issue,
but
it
is
no
longer
an
issue,
because
of
statute
of
limitations
problems.
the
only
other
witness
to
testify
as
to
anything
regarding
the
positions
in
issue
was
carlton
beall,
the
person
of
whom
i
read
all
that
testimony.
he
said,
"blacks
lay
around
like
yard
dogs
in
the
sun.
"
i
think
if
the
judge
had
gone
through
the
mcdonnell
douglas
sequence
of
saying,
is
there
a
prima
facie
case,
has
it
been
rebutted,
he
might
have
said,
i
don't
believe
beall.
i
might
believe
something
else,
but
i
can't
believe
beall,
and
he
might
have
ruled
for
the
plaintiff.
so
the
importance
of
the
prima
facie
case
is
very
great.
mr.
jack
greenberg
seventy-three,
i
think.
but
he
didn't
go...
he
went...
he
was
no
longer
postmaster
in
'73.
he
was
then
promoted
to
district...
district
manager,
and
still
was
involved
in
the
appointing
process.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
prima
facie?
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
went
through...
i
went
through
beall.
i
went
through
the
statistics.
mr.
jack
greenberg
then,
this
plaintiff
was
not
someone
who
was
merely
qualified
or
only
qualified.
he
was
someone
as
to
whom
the
record
made
it
quite
clear
that...
he
was
a
superior
employee.
he
had
been
highly
rated
by
the
promotion
advisory
board.
he
was
among
those
rated
to
be
postmaster.
his
ratings
called
him
very
efficient.
he
was
called
"an
outstanding
supervisor".
there
was
no
derogatory
information
about
him.
that
is
hardly
the
case
of
your
minimally
qualified
applicant.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right,
but
that
was
one
reason
i--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--this
case
is
not
properly
here.
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
these
were
uncontradicted.
mr.
jack
greenberg
finding
17...
finding
17
i
think
rests
upon
a
fundamental
misconception
of
what
the
mcdonnell
douglas
rule
requires.
the
mcdonnell
douglas
rule
requires...
finding
17
calls
for...
refers
to
a
comparison
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
other
applicants.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
wasn't
attempting
to
compare
them,
though
i
could
do
so.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
don't
think
it
gets
into
that.
i
think
that
when
you
are...
and
the
government
and
the
dissenting
opinion
below
made
much
of
the
fact
that
this
was
a
supervisory
position.
i
think
there
is
some
force
to
the
fact
that
if
you
are
dealing
with
a
supervisory
position,
if
someone
has
the
bare
bones,
minimal,
nominal
qualifications,
one
might
say,
well,
you
know,
it
is
a
different
kind
of
thing.
we
really
have
to
take
a
look
at
a
person
and
see
his
various
dimensions.
but
this
is
a
case
of
someone
who
far
exceeds
that,
and
i
think
in
a
way
of
stating
the
qualifications
for
a
supervisory
job,
maybe
you
have
to
state
them
a
little
differently.
here
they
were
stated
beyond
any
possibility
of
dispute.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
don't
know
what
they
meant
by
relative
qualifications.
if
by
relative
they
meant
relative
as
to
the
other
people
applying
for
the
job,
i
think
that
is
an
incorrect
and
a
destructive
interpretation
of
mcdonnell
douglas.
if
by
relative
you
mean
relative
to
the
nominal
qualifications
for
the
job,
i
think...
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that,
and
i
think
that
is--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--well,
i
have
spoken
about
nothing
but
uncontradicted
evidence
so
far,
so
i
don't
think
there's
any
problem
with
findings
of
fact.
there
were
no
findings
of
fact
about
beall,
and
there
were
no
findings
of
fact
about
statistics,
and
there
is
no
conflict
about
that.
but
i
do

mr.
jack
greenberg
--i
disagree
with
the
government's
test.
i
think
the
test
of
mcdonnell
douglas
is
extremely
important
to
maintain
in
this
case,
if
this
court
goes
on
to
decide
it,
and
precisely
because
of
the
kinds
of
facts
which
have
been
developed
in
this
case.
the
case
is
very
unusual.
nowadays
one
is
not
going
to
find
evidence
of
a
racist
supervisor.
people
don't
say
the
kinds
of
things
that
beall
said
ways.
if
the
court
decides
to
decide
this
case,
there
is
only
one
way
it
can
decide
it,
and
that
is
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
and
we
would
hope
that
it
does
so
in
such
a
way
which
leaves
the
rule
of
mcdonnell
douglas
viable
as
a
means
of
combating
employment
discrimination,
which
remains
far
too
pervasive
today.
thank
you.
