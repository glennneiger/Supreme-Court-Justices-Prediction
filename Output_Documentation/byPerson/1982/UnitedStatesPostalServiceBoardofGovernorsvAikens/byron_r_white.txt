and
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
that
to
say
that
if
the
employer
puts
on
no
evidence,
or
does
nothing,
there
must
be
judgment
for
the
plaintiff?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
that
what
is
required,
under
the
existing
rule
under
title
vii,
that
if
the
employer
does
nothing,
judgment
must
be
entered
for
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
in
mcdonnell
if
there
had
been
two
applicants,
one
black
and
one
white,
both
qualified,
that
the...
just
because
the
white
was
chosen
would
not
make
out
a
prima
facie
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
the
ultimate
question
the
question
of
discriminatory
intent?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
set
of
facts
will
justify
in
inference
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
in
mcdonnell
it
did,
and
you
say
here
it
does
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
wallace,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
case...
if
there
were
proof
in
this
case
that
the
applicant
for
the
position
was
more
qualified,
that
would
necessarily
determine
the
fourth
element,
i
would
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
you
said
before,
it
would
not
if
he
was
just
equally
qualified,
or
less
qualified.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
isn't
the
absence...
this
record
doesn't
show,
or
there
are
no
findings
on
the
relative
qualifications.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
overturn
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
greenberg,
is
it
often
that
in
a
disparate
treatment
case,
the
prima
facie
case
is
made
out
on
statistics?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
got
some
cases
on
that?
perhaps
in
practice--
justice
byron
r.
white
greenberg,
do
you
agree
with
the
statement
of
the
court
of
appeals,
"the
prima
facie
case
in
a
suit
alleging
individual
discrimination
does
not
require
a
showing
of
discriminatory
motive?
"
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
sense
the
court
of
appeals
used
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
giving
rise
to
an
inference
that
the
individual
was
intentionally
discriminated
against?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
reason
he
was
denied
the
promotion
was
that
the
employer
was
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
race?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
the
ultimate
inference
have
to
be
that
from
this
circumstantial
evidence,
we
will
conclude,
or
there
is
evidence
to
support--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
inference
that
that
is
exactly
what
he
was
thinking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
need
any
direct
evidence
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
you
disagree
with
this
statement
of
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
be
interested
in
your
other
two
ways
of
proving
your--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
went
through
two
of
them,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
a
problem
then
with
the
district
court
findings
as
well
as
with
the
court
of
appeals.
none
of
these
three...
well,
certainly
your
first
two
bases
for
making
a
prima
facie
case
is
not
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
approached
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
one
is
not
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
one
is
not
either.
we
can't
decide
all
these
facts
up
here,
can
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
strange,
then,
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
a
lack
of
evidence
as
to
relative
qualifications.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
the
plaintiff
as
part
of
his
prima
facie
case
is
going
to
have
to
prove
that
he
was
more
qualified
than--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that's
one
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
statistics
show
that
he
acted
contrary
to
his
economic
self-interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
so
frequent
in
disparate
treatment
cases,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
make
a
prima
facie
case
by
statistics.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
may
call
a
defendant's
president
or
personnel
manager
or
foreman
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
so
all
the
evidence
comes
out
on--
