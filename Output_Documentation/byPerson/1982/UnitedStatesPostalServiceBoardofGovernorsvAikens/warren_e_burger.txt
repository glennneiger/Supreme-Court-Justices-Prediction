we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
united
states
postal
service
against
aikens.
mr.
wallace,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
a
matter
of
prudence,
a
trial
judge
might
simply
decide,
might
he
not,
that
he
would
like
the
whole
record
there
so
that
if
there
is
an
appeal
it
will
be
disposed
of
in
one
stroke?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
not
the
obligation
of
the
reviewing
court
be
to
decide...
go
on
beyond
that
and
decide
whether,
assuming
arguendo
that
a
prima
facie
case
had
been
made
out,
that
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
didn't
support
the
plaintiff?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that
ends
the
case.
you
say
that
ends
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
greenberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--does
this
record
show
what
the
breakdown
was
in
management
level
personnel
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
that
that
was
of
some
importance
as
to...
to
make
a
comparison?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
what
do
they
do
about
that?
do
they
dismiss
all
the
management
level
people
to
make
way
for
new
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
doesn't
that
factor
affect
the
weight
of
the
statistics
that
you
are
suggesting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
statistics
don't
bear
on
the
immediate
question
of
the
opening,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
were
the
openings?
at
what
stage
in
this
whole
panorama
were
the
openings
where
he
declined
to
accept
a
promotion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i
assumed
that,
but
you
don't
know
where
in
that
sequence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
beall
go
out
of
office
in
this
sequence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
united
states
postal
service
against
aikens
will
be
announced
by
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
rehnquist.
