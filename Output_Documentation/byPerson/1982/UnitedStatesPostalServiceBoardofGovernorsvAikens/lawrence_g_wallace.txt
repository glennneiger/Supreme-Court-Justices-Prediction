mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
employment
discrimination
case
involves
a
claim
of
disparate
treatment
which
is
under
this
court's
decisions
of
claim
of
intentional
racial
discrimination,
under
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
the
case
is
before
the
court
for
a
second
time.
in
june,
1981,
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
filed
by
solicitor
general
mccree,
the
court
with
two
justices
dissenting
vacated
and
remanded
the
case
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
texas
department
of
community
affairs
against
burdine,
and
the
case
is
now
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
decision
on
that
remand.
our
concern,
and
the
question
presented
in
both
of
the
petitions,
focuses
exclusively
on
the
legal
standard
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
establishing
a
prima
facie
case
of
employment
discrimination
in
situations
where
the
employer
is
selecting
an
individual
from
a
group
of
qualified
individuals
which
is
racially
or
sexually
or
heterogeneous.
the
particular
case
arises
in
the
context
of
promotions.
for
present
purposes,
the
facts
may
be
simply
stated.
with
respect
to
the
promotions
and
details
at
issue,
after
an
administrative
investigation
and
hearing
and
appeal
from
that
hearing
were
all
resolved
against
him,
the
respondent
filed
suit
under
title
vii
in
the
district
court.
the
postal
service
did
not
deny
that
the
respondent,
along
with
other
individuals
under
consideration,
had
the
qualifications
necessary
to
be
eligible
for
the
promotions
and
details,
and
there
was
no
dispute
that
respondent
is
a
black
person,
and
that
the
postal
service
selected
white
employees
for
the
particular
promotions
and
details
at
issue
instead
of
respondent.
the
district
court
found
that
from
1952
to
1966,
respondent
had
advanced
steadily
through
a
succession
of
supervisory
positions
in
the
d.c.
post
office,
and
by
march
of
1973,
he
was
the
fifth
highest
ranking
official
in
that
post
office.
it
also
found
no
evidence
of
specific
acts
of
discrimination
against
him,
and
no
other
direct
evidence
that
he
was
treated
any
differently
because
of
his
race
from
the
way
other
employees
were
treated.
and
the
district
court
found
no
credible
evidence
that
he
was
as
qualified
or
more
qualified
than
other
individuals
who
were
detailed
or
promoted
during
the
period
in
question.
it
also
found
that
there
had
been
a
considerable
increase
in
the
number
of
black
employees
occupying
high
level
positions
in
the
district
of
columbia
post
office
during
the
pertinent
period,
and
that
during
that
period,
other
blacks
as
well
as
whites
were
promoted
or
detailed
to
positions
above
the
respondent's
position,
and
that
by
the
time
of
the
district
court's
opinion,
almost
all
the
high
level
positions
in
that
post
office
were
held
by
blacks.
now,
none
of
these
findings
was
held
to
be
clearly
erroneous,
and
for
present
purposes,
even
though
it's
possible
that
other
inferences
could
have
been
drawn
from
the
underlying
facts,
which
are
rehearsed
at
some
length
in
respondent's
brief,
the
underlying
evidence,
for
present
purposes,
those
findings
are
the
premise
of
the
case,
because
they
are
the
premise
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
rendered
its
decision,
and
those
facts
found
by
the
district
court
do
not
in
our
view
add
up
to
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination.
the
reason
for
this
can
be
simply
stated.
if
unexplained,
those
findings
do
not
show
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
employer's
selection
was
based
on
an
impermissible
consideration,
such
as
race,
to
paraphrase
this
court's
opinion
in
the
fernco
case,
or
if
unexplained,
these
facts
do
not
show
circumstances
giving
rise
to
an
inference
of
unlawful
discrimination,
to
paraphrase
what
this
court
said
in
the
burdine
case.
in
other
words,
when
this
court
had
spoken
generically
about
what
constitutes
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
under
title
vii,
the
standard
is
really
no
different
from
what
it
is
in
establishing
any
other
prima
facie
case,
a
showing
that
if
the
showing
is
unrefuted
in
any
way,
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
case
has
been
proven.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
way
most
of
these
cases
arise,
on
a
rule
41(b)
motion
at
the
conclusion
of
the
plaintiff's
evidence,
and
that
is
what
we
mean
here,
what
we
are
referring
to
here,
and
by
and
large
what
the
court
has
been
referring
to
in
its
opinions
in
this
field.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
not
inconsistent
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
burdine.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
not
really
a
directed
verdict
in
these
cases.
title
vii
cases
are
tried
to
the
court.
it
is
a
rule
41(b)
motion,
and
since
the
standard
of
proof
is
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
if
the
district
court
at
the
conclusion
of
the
plaintiff's
evidence
concludes
that
that
evidence
shows
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
discrimination
was
a
factor
and
the...
and
therefore
denies
the
41(b)
motion,
and
the
defendant
rests,
that's
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
he
has
met
his
burden
of
showing
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
conceivable,
mr.
justice,
although
he
would
be
more
likely
to
be
reserving
judgment
on
whether
the
plaintiff
has
made
out
a
sufficient
case
to
withstand
the
rule
41(b)
motion.
he
can't
really
be
depending
on
the
defendant's
evidence
to
complete
the
plaintiff's
showing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
may
very
well,
and
that's
essentially
what
happened
in
this
case.
there
was
a
full
trial
in
this
case,
although
at
the
end
of
it
the
district
court
ruled,
as
the
court
of
appeals
read
its
ruling,
that
the
plaintiff
had
failed
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case.
in
any
event--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
read
the
district
court's
opinion
in
this
case
as
passing
on
that
question
as
well,
because
the
district
court
did
hear
all
the
evidence,
but
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
us.
we
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
the
first
time
the
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
making
that
point,
and
that
petition
for
rehearing
was
denied.
we
have
not
contested
that
issue
further
before
this
court,
either
on
the
first
petition
or
on
the
second
petition.
we
have
accepted
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling
that
in
effect
the
district
court
granted
the
rule
41(b)
motion
after
hearing
all
of
the
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
not,
mr.
justice.
as
i
said,
we
thought
initially
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error
in
the
way
it
read
the
district
court's
judgment
in
the
case,
but
the
district
court's
conclusions
were
not
a
model
of
clarity.
in
one
conclusion,
the
district
court
did
say
that
the
plaintiff
had
failed
to
make
a
prima
facie
case,
although
the
district
court
had
earlier
denied
the
41(b)
motion.
as
we
read
what
happened,
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
said
that
the
district
court
belatedly
granted
the
rule
41(b)
motion
in
this
case,
and
treated
the
case
as
if
the
district
court
had
not
made
findings
about
whether
the
prima
facie
case
had
been
rebutted
by
the
defendant,
even
though
the
evidence
may
well
have
been
heard
here
in
its
entirety.
we
don't
really
regard
the
procedural
rules
for
title
vii
cases
as
different
from
those
in
any
other
field
of
law.
the
confusion
has
stemmed,
we
think,
from
a
misuse
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
circuit
and
by
some
other
lower
courts
of
the
more
particularized
analytical
framework
that
this
court
applied
in
the
mcdonnell
douglas
against
green
case,
that
fit
the
facts
of
that
particular
case
in
analyzing
whether
a
prima
facie
case
had
been
made
out
on
the
facts
that
were
before
the
court
there.
we
don't
regard
that
framework
as
inconsistent
with
the
later,
more
generic
descriptions
of
what
constitutes
a
prima
facie
case
that
i
adverted
to
earlier
in
my
argument,
but
rather
as
a
useful
analytical
guide
to
the
particular
facts
that
were
before
the
court
in
mcdonnell
douglas
against
green,
and
that
analysis
is
set
forth
on
page
6
of
our
brief.
and
it
fit
that
case
very
well,
because
it
showed
not
only
that
the
plaintiff
was
a
minority
applicant
who
applied
and
was
qualified
for
the
job,
and
despite
his
qualifications
was
rejected,
but
importantly,
there's
a
fourth
element,
that
after
his
rejection,
the
employer,
contrary
to
his
apparent
economic
self-interest,
continued
to
carry
the
vacancy
that
he
was
trying
to
fulfill
and
continued
to
look
for
applications
from
persons
of
the
plaintiff's
qualifications.
now,
what
the
court
below
has
failed
to
recognize
is
that
in
a
different
factual
circumstance
where
that
fourth
element
is
neutralized
by
the
employer's
mere
selection
of
one
qualified
applicant
over
another,
these
four
elements
in
themselves
no
longer
add
up
to
a
prima
facie
case
that
makes
it
more--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
exactly
our
point,
mr.
justice,
that
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
something
more
than
these
four
elements
if
the
fourth
element
is
neutralized,
because
the
fourth
element
was
a
necessary
part
of
what
added
up
to
the
prima
facie
case
as
those
facts
were
analyzed,
because
it
was
an
element
of
an
employer
acting
contrary
to
his
apparent
economic
self-interest,
and
therefore
put
a
burden
of
production
on
him.
the
burden
of
persuasion
never
shifts,
but
a
burden
of
production
on
him
to
come
forward
or
else
judgment
would
be
re-entered
against
him
to
explain
why
he
acted
contrary
to
his
apparent
economic
self-interest.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
order
to
come
up
with
something
comparable
to
the
fourth
element
here,
to
show
that
the
employer
was
acting
contrary
to
his
apparent
economic
self-interest,
one
would
have
to
say
that
that
would
be
shown
by
his
selecting
someone
less
qualified
than
the
plaintiff.
if
he
is
merely
selecting
someone
equally
qualified,
the
fourth
element
remains
neutralized
in
our
view.
this
court
said
in
burdine
that
so
long
as
impermissible
considerations
are
not
the
governing
factor,
an
employer
has
discretion
to
choose
among
equally
qualified
persons.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
ultimate
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
precisely
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
point,
that...
the
fact
that
four
elements
were
specified
in
mcdonnell
that
added
up
to
a
prima
facie
showing
has
misled
the
court
below
into
thinking
that
those
are
the
only
four
elements
one
needs
to
analyze
in
a
case
of
this
sort,
and
even
though
the
fourth
element
becomes
neutralized
by
applying
it
to
a
different
set
of
facts,
the
formula
his
been
woodenly
carried
over
to
this
different
set
of
facts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don't
really
think
that
makes
a
difference
from
a
situation
where
a
new
hire
is
made
by
selecting
from
among
a
group
of
qualified
applicants.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
long
as
there
is
a
situation
where
the
vacancy
is
carried
in
the
initial
hiring
situation
for
any
period
of
time
where
it
would
have
been
presumably
economically
advantageous
to
the
employer
to
hire
someone,
then
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
shown
in
our
view,
but
if
you
have
a
situation
where
it
is
known
that
a
vacancy
will
be
upcoming
in
a
period
of
weeks
or
months,
and
applications
are
being
collected
and
scrutinized,
and
then
a
selection
is
made
to
replace
the
individual
who
is
retiring
or
leaving
by
selecting
from
among
the
applicants,
that
doesn't
show
that
the
employer
acted
in
some
way
contrary
to
his
economic
interests,
and
unless
there
is
something
more
of
a
showing,
we
don't
see
that
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
has
been
shown
by
the
mere
fact
that
another
qualified
applicant
was
selected
rather
than
the
plaintiff.
that
is
our
point.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
that,
you
know,
there
is
much
food
for
thought
in
what
judge
wilkie
wrote,
but
he
as
well
as
the
other
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
focused
exclusively
in
this
case
on
whether
there
had
been
a
sufficient
showing
of
the
second
element
of
the
four
elements
in
the
mcdonnell
douglas
analysis,
a
showing
that
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
qualified
for
the
job.
there
had
been
some
dispute
about
that
during
the
trial,
because
he
had
refused
to
accept
assignments
to
certain
positions
that
were
said
to
have
been
positions
that
would
have
made
him
better
qualified
to
be
considered
for
the
promotions
that
he
was
interested
in.
and
ultimately,
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
whether
the
employer
had
adequately
specified
that
that
kind
of
experience
was
a
desirable
qualification,
even
though
not
necessarily
an
indispensable
qualification
for
the
position
at
issue.
but
no
one
on
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
the
real
shortcoming
was
not
that
he
wasn't
qualified,
at
least
minimally,
for
consideration
for
these
jobs,
but
that
he
didn't
show
it
added
up
to
a
showing
that
it
was
more
likely
than
not
that
the
selection
resulted
from
discrimination
because
the
fourth
element
had
been
neutralized
in
the
mcdonnell
douglas
analysis.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
one
way
of
showing
that
the
employer--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
there
is
a
finding
that
there
is
no
credible
evidence
that
he
showed
that
he
was
as
qualified
or
more
qualified
than
the
applicant...
than
the
successful
applicants.
there
is
a
finding
to
that
effect.
the
underlying
evidence
would
have
permitted
the
drawing
of
a
difference
inference,
but
that
is
the
inference
that
the
district
court
drew,
and
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--didn't
overturn
it.
and
that
is
the
premise
on
which
the
case
is
in
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
one
could--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes.
one
could
possibly
read
it
that
way.
the
way
we
have
read
it
is
that
they
were
holding
that
it
was
legally
irrelevant
whether
he
was
as
qualified
or
more
qualified.
so
long
as
he
was
qualified
for
the
job
and
the
job
went
to
a
non-minority
applicant,
the
standards
of
the
mcdonnell
douglas
analysis
had
been
met,
and
that
it
wasn't
a
proper
legal
basis
for
the
district
court
to
have
done
what
it
did.
it
never
said
that
anything
that
the
district
court
found
was
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
ultimately,
there
must
be
a
finding
in
a
disparate
treatment
case
of
discriminatory
motive.
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
need
be
direct
proof
of
discriminatory
motive.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief,
in
the
discussion
of
various
ways
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case,
that
direct
i
evidence,
anecdotal
evidence,
evidence
of
discriminatory
treatment
of
the
individual
in
other
ways
could
be
introduced
as
a
way
of
making
a
prima
facie
case.
but
in
light
of
the
rest
of
the
district
court's
findings,
there
was
nothing
improper
about
the
district
court
noting
as
well
that
there
was
no
direct
evidence
of
discriminatory
motive.
the
district
court
was
looking
to
see
whether
there
was
anything
that
added
up
to
a
prima
facie
showing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
law.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
perhaps...
perhaps
upon
re-evaluation
by
the
court
of
appeals,
they
would
want
a
further
finding
made
by
the
district
court,
although
the
rest
of
the
district
court's
findings
do
not
add
up
to
a
prima
facie
case
regardless
of
whether
the
district
court
made
a
legal
error
in
its
discussion
of
the
lack
of
evidence
of
discriminatory
motive.
so
long
as
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
set
aside
any
of
these
findings,
factual
findings,
as
clearly
erroneous,
it
seems
to
us
the
judgment
that
must
be
entered
is
clear.
perhaps
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
the
rest
of
the
findings
still
do
not
add
up
to
a
prima
facie
case,
and
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
district
court
to
resolve
in
his
findings
that
could
add
up
to
a
prima
facie
case,
so
that
i
don't
see
that
that
is
critical
to
the
district
court's
disposition.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
conceivable,
although
he
did
specifically
find
that
there
was
no
credible
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
was
as
qualified
or
more
qualified
than
the
persons
actually
selected.
that
finding
is
quite
precise.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
the
absence
of
some
other
finding
that
would
have
shown
that
the
selection
more
likely
than
not
was
the
result
of
discrimination,
and
there
is
no
other
such
finding,
and
the
error
that
justice
stevens
is
talking
about,
if
corrected,
it
still
would
not
amount
to
a
finding
that
could
add
up
to
a
prima
facie
showing.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
please.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do
not
say
that
there
is
no
possible
way
of
reading
this
record
to
give
rise
to
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination,
or
that
there
is
no
possibility
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
overturned
the
district
court's
factual
findings
as
clearly
erroneous.
we
think
that
is
a
job
for
the
court
of
appeals,
not
this
court.
what
we
are
concerned
about
is
the
standard
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
applied
in
this
and
in
other
cases,
and
that
is
now
generally
applicable
to
cases
with
much
simpler
underlying
facts
for
the
establishment
of
a
prima
facie
case,
and
that
we
believe
is
erroneous.
we
see
no
inconsistency
with
this
court's
holding
in
burdine.
in
footnote
6
of
the
burdine
opinion,
it
is
pointed
out
that
the
prima
facie
case
was
made
there
because
the
plaintiff
showed
that
she
was
a
qualified
woman
who
sought
an
available
position,
but
the
position
was
left
open
for
several
months
before
she
finally
was
rejected
in
favor
of
a
male
who
had
been
under
her
supervision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
one
way
of
showing
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
one
way
of
showing
that
the
employer
acted
contrary
to
his
economic
self-interest,
or
a
showing
can
be
made
through
statistics
or
through
direct
evidence
of
discrimination,
or
through
the
carrying
of
a--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--no,
well,
that
is
only...
acting
contrary
to
economic
self-interest
is
only
one
way
of
showing
a
prima
facie
case.
a
statistical
showing
is
an
alternative
method.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
statistical
showing?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
not
frequent.
there
was
some
effort
made
to
do
it
here,
as
well
as
an
effort
made
to
show
superior
qualifications.
the
only
presumption
that
has
been
applied
differently
in
title
vii
cases
has
been
a
presumption
requiring
judgment
if
the
defendant
has
not
come
forward
with
any
non-discriminatory
explanation
after
the
prima
facie
case
has
been
made.
in
practice,
this
question
seldom
arises
because
the
plaintiff
usually
knows
what
the
defendant's
explanation
is
before
the
plaintiff
ever
puts
on
his
own
case,
and
his
rebuttal
of
that
explanation
is
usually
put
on
as
part
of
the
plaintiff's
case.
the
discrete
phases
that
are
postulated
in
mcdonnell
douglas
are
not
the
way
these
cases
by
and
large
are
being
tried.
the
plaintiff
discovers
through
discovery
or
the
administrative
record
what
the
reasons
are,
and
then
you
have
your
normal
rules
applying.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
an
effort--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
then
the
rule
41(b)
motion
is
made,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
trier
of
fact
thinks
it
more
likely
than
not
that
discrimination
was
the
motivating
factor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
and
that
was
true
in
mcdonnell-douglas
itself.
he
just
showed
that
he
was
minimally
qualified,
but
that
the
employer
carried
the
vacancy
rather
than
hired
him,
and
that
was
a
prima
facie
case.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
mcdonnell-douglas
and
supported
it
at
the
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
precisely
so,
mr.
justice.
