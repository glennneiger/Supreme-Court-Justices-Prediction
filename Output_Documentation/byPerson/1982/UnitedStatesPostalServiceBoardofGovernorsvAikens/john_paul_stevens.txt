justice
john
paul

mr.
wallace,
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
overturn
it,
but
they
do
say...
the
first
of
the
two
errors
that
they
say
the
lower
court
made
was
that
the
majority
on
the
first
appeal
rejected
the
district
court's...
it
calls
it
a
legal
conclusion,
i
guess,
but
that
the
appellant's
claim
failed
because
he
did
not
prove
that
he
was
as
qualified
or
more
qualified
than
the
individuals
who
were
promoted,
and
then
earlier
they
had
said
that
they
had
concluded
he
was
more
qualified,
or
as
qualified
or
more
qualified,
and
judge
wilkie
said
they
shouldn't
have
done
that,
that
they
were
finding
facts
which
they
should,
but
weren't
they
implicitly
saying
that
the
finding
was
clearly
erroneous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
little
hard
to
understand,
because
they
also
talk
about
it
as
a
summary
judgment,
i
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
didn't
use
those
words.
what
about
the
second
branch
of
the
court
of
the
court
of
appeals
holding?
they
say
also
there
was
error
in
conclusion
of
law
number
7,
in
which
the
district
judge
said
that
there
must
be
proof
of
discriminatory
motive.
do
you
disagree
with
their
treatment
of
the
motive
issue,
either
at
the
district
court
level
or
the
court
of
appeals
level?
what
is
your
view
of
that
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
district
court
did
more
than
that.
the
district
court
said,
critical
to
this
showing
is
proof
of
discriminatory
motive
on
the
part
of
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
that
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
what
is
the
proper
disposition
of
the
appeal?
should
it
not
go
back
to
the
district
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
one
element
of
his
holding
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
erroneous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
if
the
district
judge
thought
it
was
necessary
to
have
direct
evidence
of
motive,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
might
permeate
the
rest
of
the...
well,
your
view
is
that
we
could
just
disregard
that
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
there
was
evidence
in
the
record...
it
is
not
necessarily
recited
in
his
findings...
of
a
pattern
of
filling
a
vacancy...
there
were
something
like
20
or
25
vacancies
that
were
regularly
filled
by
a
white
person
who
had
less
education,
less
seniority,
and
less
paper
qualifications
than
the
plaintiff,
and
i
suppose
it
would
be
conceivable
that
one
could
draw
an
inference
of
discrimination
from
that
circumstantial
evidence,
and
yet
the
district
court
might
have
erred
by
thinking
he
had
to
have
direct
evidence
of
improper
motive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
greenberg,
are
those
statistics
really
that
dramatic,
if
you
look
at
the
period
when
the
statute
was
passed,
and
assume
you
started
with
a
disparity
at
least
that
bad
and
maybe
even
worse
which
would
have
been
produced
by
conduct
that
may
have
been
something
we
don't
approve
of,
but
was
lawful
at
the
time
it
took
place?
do
your
statistics
demonstrate
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
question
is
whether
those
statistics
are
meaningful
unless
you
know
what
the
statistics
were
at
the
date
the
act
was
passed,
and
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
the
two-year
period,
you
have
to
say
that
in
the
two-year
period,
there
was
a
course
of
conduct
that
demonstrates
that
during
those
two
years
there
was
discrimination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
had
the
same
statistics
a
week
after
the
act
was
passed,
would
that
make
a
prima
facie
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
think
it
clearly
does
two
years
afterwards?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
a
contrary
finding,
isn't
there?
that
is
finding
17.
what
do
you
do
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
third
ground,
i
think
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
your
third
ground
that
it
is
a
prima
facie
case
even
if
each
of
the
other
competitors
for
the
same
position
was
also
extraordinarily
well
qualified
and
perhaps
even
better
qualified
than
the
plaintiff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
wallace,
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
on
your
theory?
the
district
judge
at
the
end
of
his
conclusions
of
law
stated
that
the
plaintiff
had
failed
to
prove
that
he
was...
let's
see
if
i
can
find
the
exact...
that
he
was
"as
qualified
or
more
qualified
than
the
individuals
who
were
promoted
or
detailed.
"
that
was
a
reason
why
there
was
no
prima
facie
case.
i
don't
understand
you
to
be
arguing
that
in
every
case
the
plaintiff
must
prove
either
equal
or
superior
qualifications.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
other
ways
which
he
could
prove
it
even
under
your
view.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
not
ask
for
a
rule
that
says
the
plaintiff
must
always
meet
this
particular
standard
that
this
district
court
seemed
to
apply.
