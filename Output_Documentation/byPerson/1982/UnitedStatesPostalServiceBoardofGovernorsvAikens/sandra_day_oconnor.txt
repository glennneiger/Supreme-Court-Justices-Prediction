justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
would
have
met
the
burden
that
you
say
he
should
have
met
had
he
established
that
he
was
as
qualified
or
more
qualified
than
the
person
selected?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
as
i
read
judge
wilkie's
dissenting
opinion,
he
was
suggesting
still
a
different
test,
and
i
wondered
if
you
wanted
to
comment
on
his
approach.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
greenberg,
it
sounds
to
me
in
your
argument
as
though
you
don't
really
disagree
with
the
government's
proposed
test.
you
simply
disagree
with
the
application
or
findings
of
fact
that
were
made
in
this
particular
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
accepting
the
government's
test,
you
say--
