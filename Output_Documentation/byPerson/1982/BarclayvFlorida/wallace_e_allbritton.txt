mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
state
of
florida
has
never
claimed
that
defendants
in
her
courts
receive
a
perfect
trial,
but
only
a
fair
one,
and
as
of
this
date,
approximately
1:35
p.m.,
that
is
all
the
constitution
requires.
i
think
because
of
the
multiplicity
of
challenges
hurled
at
cases
availing
the
death
penalty,
it
would
seem
that
the
only
time
a
capital
defendant
receives
a
fair
trial
is
when
he
is
acquitted.
i
think
the
overriding
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
instant
case
contravenes
any
of
the
protections
afforded
by
the
petitioner
or
to
him
under
the
constitution,
not
only
the
federal
but
the
state.
a
good
starting
place
is
the
standard
of
review
followed
by
the
florida
supreme
court
in
its
review
of
death
penalty
cases.
that
court
assumes,
and
logically
so,
that
where
there
are
multiple
statutory
aggravating
factors
and
there
are
no
mitigating
factors
at
all,
then
the
weighing
process
would
have
reached
the
same
outcome
by
the
trial
judge
even
had
he
not
considered
what
is
termed
an
improper
aggravating
factor.
now,
this
principle
is
well
illustrated
in
several
cases,
and
i
will
mention
only
two
of
them.
one
is
dobbert
v.
state,
where
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
the
trial
judge
improperly
found
two
aggravating
factors,
but
since
there
were
no
mitigating
factors
at
all,
a
reversal
of
the
death
sentence
was
not
required.
and
in
ford
v.
state,
cited
on
page
15
of
my
brief,
the
same
result
was
reached
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
and
what
is
interesting
about
both
of
those
cases
is
that
this
court
declined
to
review
either
one
of
them
on
certiorari.
i
have
no
hesitancy
to
urge
to
this
court
that
petitioner's
death
penalty
was
properly
imposed
based
on
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
what
i
count
as
five
statutory
aggravating
factors,
and
no
mitigating
factors
at
all.
in
thinking
about
this,
i
want
it
to
be
understood
that
in
finding
this
non-statutory
aggravating
factor
that
is
now
complained
of
to
the
court,
the
trial
judge
did
not
consider
any
evidence
that
he
would
not
have
otherwise
known.
rather,
it
was
necessary
for
the
trial
judge
to
consider
petitioner's
prior
criminal
record
because
unless
the
existence
of
this
mitigating
factor
is
negated,
then
there
will
be
a
presumption
that
petitioner
had
not
engaged
in
any
previous
course
of
crime
at
all.
this
is
again
well
illustrated
in
the
florida
supreme
court
case
of
booker
v.
state,
where
that
court
rejected,
now,
an
argument
that
the
trial
judge
had
considered
a
non-statutory
aggravating
factor
because
on
cross
examination
the
defendant
was
interrogated
as
to
his
prior
criminal
activity.
now,
the
florida
supreme
court
pointedly
stated
that
those
questions
were
posed
to
the
defendant
in
order
to
negate
or
show
the
absence
of
a
mitigating
circumstance.
that
is,
that
the
defendant
had
no
significant
history
of
prior
criminal
actions.
now,
this
was
necessary,
as
the
court
pointed
out,
and
i
quote
the
words
of
the
court:
"unless
this
mitigating
factor
is
negated,
there
would
be
a
presumption
that
the
defendant
had
not
engaged
in
any
previous
criminal
activity.
"
therefore,
i
say
to
you
that
in
finding
a
non-statutory
aggravating
factor,
the
trial
judge
not
only
did
not
review
any
evidence
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
do
so.
rather,
he
was
required
to
review
that
evidence
in
order
to
determine
the
existence
of
a...
or
the
non-existence
of
a
mitigating
factor.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
only
to
the
extent
that
i
don't
believe
in
the
lewis
case
that
the
florida
supreme
court
so
held.
i
don't
read
the
case
that
way
at
all,
but
if
we
assume
that
they
did
so
hold,
then
i
say
in
the
instant
case
it
has
to
be
obvious
that
this
mitigating
factor,
that
is,
the
advisory
verdict
of
the
jury,
was
completely
overweighed
by
the
multiple
statutory
aggravating
factors
that
were
found
by
the
trial
judge
and
twice
approved
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
now,
i
submit
to
you
that
unless
this
court
does
a
legal
about-face
and
proffit
v.
florida,
that
that
case
should
control
the
instant
case
here.
the
proffit
opinion
at
428
us
page
246
sets
forth
the
aggravating
factors
found
by
the
trial
judge.
now,
the
second
of
those
reads,
and
i
quote,
"the
petitioner
has
a
propensity
to
commit
murder.
"
now,
i
find
this
interesting,
because
this
aggravating
factor
of
propensity
to
commit
murder
was
not
then
and
never
has
been
a
statutorily
enumerated
aggravating
factor
under
florida
law.
i
think,
frankly,
there
is
no
getting
around
the
point
that
this
court
approved
the
use
of
a
non-statutory
aggravating
factor
when
used,
now,
along
with
other
statutory
aggravating
factors.
the
decision
in
elledge
v.
state
supports
the
respondent's
argument
here,
because
the
elledge
court
in
construing
proffit
read
something
in
there,
i
believe,
that
is
not
there,
but
rather
than
to
go
into
that,
let's
take
elledge
the
way
it
stands,
and
elledge
simply
holds
that
a
non-statutory
aggravating
factor
will
not
vitiate
a
death
penalty
where
there
are
other
statutorily
enumerated
factors
and
there
are
no
mitigating
factors.
that
is
the
holding
in
elledge.
i
would
like
to
tell
you
how
they
came
to
do
that.
from
the
record
in
elledge,
there
was
a
non-statutory
enumerated
aggravating
factor,
and
of
course
there
was
a
statutory
aggravating
factor,
and
the
trial
judge
had
alluded
to
something
that
could
have
been
construed
as
being
a
mitigating
factor.
well,
now,
what
the
florida
supreme
court
wanted
to
do,
and
what
they
did
do,
was
to
be
sure
that
a
non-statutory
aggravating
factor
would
not
be
used
to
offset
a
mitigating
factor
in
the
weighing
process,
but
we
don't
have
that
problem
here,
because
there
were
no
mitigating
factors
at
all
unless
you
do
as
my
honorable
opponent
would
urge
you
to
do,
and
that
is
substitute
your
judgment
and
reweigh
all
of
the
aggravating
factors
that
were
weighed
by
the
trial
judge
and
approved
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
if
you
do
that,
then
you
will
depart
from
the
decision
in
eddings
v.
oklahoma.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
may
be.
that's
true.
it
may
be.
but
the
florida
supreme
court
does
not
undertake
to
dictate
to
the
trial
judge
what
he
shall
regard
as
mitigating
evidence.
that
is
a
matter
for
the
sentencing
authority
to
do,
not
for
the
florida
supreme
court.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
just
the
way
i
did
to
justice
o'connor,
that
i
don't
believe,
and
i
don't
read
the
case--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you,
and
i
submit
to
you,
sir,
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
you
understood
what
i
said.
you
may
have.
i
don't
know.
but
if
i
said
that,
i
did
not
mean
to
say
it.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
sure.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
lewis,
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
language
in
it
which
would
indicate
that
a
jury
advisory
can
be
viewed
if
the
trial
judge
so
desires
as
a
mitigating
factor.
however,
the
verdict
of
the
jury...
it
isn't
really
a
verdict,
it's
an
advisory.
it
isn't
binding
on
the
trial
judge
at
all,
and
if
he
so
desires
in
view
of
the...
in
view
of
the
other
evidence,
you
can
read
lewis
as
saying
that
he
can
use
that
as
a
mitigating
factor,
but
i
don't
think
the
florida
supreme
court
has
required
him
to
do
that.
i
don't
read
the
case
that
way.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that's
correct,
because
he
is
the
sentencing
authority
under
florida
law.
he
is
the
one
that
does
the
weighing
under
florida
law.
the
florida
supreme
court
simply
on
review
looks
at
the
evidence
and
determines
if
it
is
competent
to
support
the
aggravating
factors
that
the
trial
judge
has
found.
they
do
that.
in
fact,
the
duty
is
well
stated
in
songer
v.
state,
which
this
court
referred
to
in
proffit
v.
florida,
and
i
quote:
"where
the
death
penalty
has
been
imposed,
this
court
has
a
separate
responsibility
to
determine
independently
whether
the
imposition
of
the
ultimate
penalty
is
warranted.
"
and
that
is
what
they
do.
they
don't
reweigh
in
the
sense,
if
you
please,
to
determine
if
the
death
penalty
is
or
should
be
initially
imposed,
but
what
they
do
on
review
is
to
determine
if
it
has
been
lawfully
imposed,
if
there
is
competent
evidence
cited
by
the
trial
judge
in
support
of
his
findings.
i
think,
too,
that
the
florida
supreme
court
standard
of
review
in
death
penalty
cases
can
be
reviewed
actually
for
what
it
is,
and
that
is
the
application
of
the
harmless
error
rule.
now,
there
is
nothing
new
in
this,
because
more
than
30
years
ago
in
north
v.
state,
decided
in
1952,
the
florida
supreme
court
expressly
held
that
the
harmless
error
rule
was
applicable
in
capital
cases.
and
not
only
that,
in
the
two
ferguson
cases,
which
i
cite
in
my
brief,
the
application
of
the
harmless
error
rule
is
clear.
for
example,
in
ferguson,
417
southern
2nd
631,
the
court
held
that,
and
i
quote,
"any
error
that
occurred
in
the
consideration
of
the
inapplicable
aggravating
circumstances
was
harmless.
"
and
again,
in
ferguson
417
639,
the
court
held
that
any
error
that
occurred
in
the
consideration
of
the
two
inapplicable
aggravating
factors
was
harmless,
based
on
the
weighing
process
that
the
judge
followed.
and
interestingly,
in
the
recent
case
of
ford
v.
strickland,
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
en
banc
opinion
filed
january
7th,
1983,
chief
judge
godbold,
in
a
dissenting
opinion
in
part
and
specially
concurring
in
part,
stated
that
he
interpreted
the
florida
supreme
court
to
apply
a
harmless
error
rule
in
refusing
to
order
resentencing,
and
that
the
florida
supreme
court's
actions
so
interpreted
passed
constitutional
muster.
this
court,
several
justices,
i
think,
have
opted
for
the
application
of
the
harmless
error
rule.
in
zant
v.
stevens,
justice
powell,
in
a
dissenting
opinion,
stated
he
would
leave
it
open
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
to
decide
whether
it
had
authority
to
find
that
the
instruction
complained
of
was
harmless
error.
in
drake
v.
zant,
justice
white
dissents,
dissenting
to
a
denial
of
cert,
stated
that
as
a
matter
of
general
constitutional
policy,
he
thought
it
essential
that
appellate
courts
be
able
to
employ
a
harmless
error
rule.
in
fact,
this
court
has
employed
the
harmless
error
rule
in
several
cases,
schnevel
v.
state,
meritan
v.
wainwright,
harrington
v.
california,
and
in
the
well-known
chapman
case.
now,
then,
looking
at
petitioner's
brief,
the
tenor
of
it
is,
of
course,
that
the
trial
judge
committed
egregious
error
in
failing
to
find
any
mitigating
factor
at
all.
well,
really,
this
is
understandable
when
viewed
from
where
he
sits.
however,
this
claim
has
been
made
and
rejected
by
the
florida
supreme
court
in
many
cases.
they
are
cited
in
my
brief,
lucas
v.
state,
sireci
v.
state,
mikenas
v.
state.
and
in
that
case...
it's
a
good
case
on
point.
it
says...
the
court
there...
let
me
phrase
this
properly...
rejected
the
argument
that
certain
testimony
should
have
been
treated
as
mitigating
factor.
there
was
psychiatric
testimony
at
trial,
and
it
was
argued
that
the
trial
judge
erred
in
refusing
to
regard
that
as
mitigating.
well,
the
florida
supreme
court
pointed
out
that
the
testimony
was
apparently
permitted
by
the
trial
judge
in
an
abundance
of
fairness
to
the
defendant,
but
that
the
court
was
not
required
to
give
it
weight
as
a
mitigating
circumstance.
now,
that
is...
they
leave
the
weighing,
initial
weighing
to
the
trial
judge.
this
premise,
i
think,
is
supported...
i
don't
think;
it
is...
well
supported
by
this
court's
decision
in
eddings
v.
oklahoma.
there,
this
court
reviewed
the
oklahoma
death
penalty
statute
which
permitted
a
defendant
to
present
evidence
as
to
any
mitigating
factor
that
he
so
desired,
and
then
stated
that
lockett
v.
ohio
requires
the
sentencer
to
listen,
but
as
to
the
weight
to
be
given
to
the
mitigating
evidence,
i
quote
the
words
of
the
court:
"we
do
not
weigh
the
evidence
for
them.
"
and
in
this
connection,
it
must
be
pointed
out
that
lockett
held
that
while
the
sentencing
authority
must
not
be
precluded
from
reviewing
anything
offered
as
mitigating,
it
did
not
undertake
to
dictate
the
weight
that
the
various
factors
are
to
be
given
by
the
trial
court,
and
that
actually
lockett
v.
ohio
does
not
claim,
does
not
hold,
and
does
not
indicate
that
this
court
would
substitute
this
judgment
for
that
of
state
courts
in
capital
cases
at
all.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it's
both.
your
honor,
the
significance
of
the
aggravating
factor
at
the
threshold
of
the
process
is
to
determine
if
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed,
if
it
can
be
imposed.
if
there
is
one
or
more,
then
the
judge
knows
that
it
can
be
imposed,
but
thereafter,
then
there
is
a
weighing
process,
weighing
the
aggravating
against
the
mitigating.
that
is
where
the
weighing
comes
in
for
him
to
find
out
or
make
up
his
mind
if
he
should
impose
the
death
penalty.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
oh,
no.
no,
he
isn't.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
absolutely,
he
is
not.
there
is
no
requirement
that
he
impose
it
at
all.
he
might
find
five
aggravating
factors,
and
no
mitigating
factors.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
as
long
as
there
are
no
mitigating.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
but
under
the
elledge
case,
the
supreme
court
will
not
permit,
justice
white,
a
non-statutory
aggravating
factor
to
offset
any
mitigating
factor
in
the
weighing
process.
that's
the
point.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
that
was
an
error.
well,
it
would
be
an
error.
now,
you
see,
justice
white,
at
the
time
of
petitioner's
trial--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--in
february
and
march,
1975,
non-statutory
aggravating
factors
had
not
been
withdrawn
from
use
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
that
was
not
done
until
two
years
afterward,
when
that
court
decided
furley
v.
state.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
it
was.
that
was
the
law.
absolutely.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
you
can
if
you
want
to,
but
if
you
apply
the
law
as
it
is
now,
you
are
still
going
to
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
harmless
error.
absolutely.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it's
been
referred
to
as
the
harmless
error,
yes.
and
i
don't
see
any
other
reason
to
call
it
anything
but
that.
they
use
words
to
the
effect
that
where
there
are
multiple
aggravating
and
no
mitigating--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--i
don't
know.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
not
under
all
cases,
no.
there
is
one
case...
i'm
sorry,
the
states,
now--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
because
there
was
no
mitigating
factors
to
be
offset--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--by
the
non-statutory
aggravating
factor.
that
is
why.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
let's
assume
you
do
that,
that
it
requires
that.
if
the
aggravating,
non-statutory
aggravating
factor
offsets
that,
you
still
have
five
statutory
enumerated
aggravating
factors
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
that
hasn't
been...
well,
it
has,
too.
he
argues
that
it
is,
and
he
wants
you
to
substitute
your
judgment
for
that
of
the
state
trial
judge.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
sir?
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that's
what
he
does.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
because
harmless
error
is
used
in
everything.
if
you
are
going
to
take
out
the
harmless
error--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--justice
marshall,
if
you
take
out
harmless
error,
you
are
requiring
the
trial
to
be
perfect,
and
none
of
them
are.
there
isn't
anything
in
the
realm
of
human
affairs
that
is
without
some
error
somewhere.
we
can't
give
a
man
a
perfect
trial.
he
can't
get
one
anywhere
else.
nowhere.
but
we
can
come
as
close
to
it
as
humanly
possible.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it's...
yes,
sir,
it
certainly
is.
it
is
harmless.
i
want
to...
my
time
is
about
up.
i
had
other
things
to
say,
but
they
will
go
by
the
board.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
i
am
aware
of
the
holdings
in
stromberg
v.
california,
yates
v.
united
states,
street
v.
new
york,
and
the
other
cases.
those
were
first
amendment
cases
involving
a
general
verdict
of
guilt.
however,
i
agree
with
justice
white
when
he
stated
in
dissenting
opinion
in
drake
v.
zant
that
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
despite
a
failure
to
sustain
all
of
the
aggravating
factors
found
by
the
jury
does
not
conflict
with
either
stromberg
v.
california
or
street
v.
new
york.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
know
it.
0
[generallaughter.]
i've
got
a
good
paddle,
though.
judge,
i
want
to
conclude
on
this
point.
it
seems
to
me,
and
i
know
this
is
policy,
or
politics,
or
whatever,
but
it
seems
to
me,
and
it
seems
to
us
down
there
in
that
little
state
of
florida,
that
at
some
point
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
seemingly
never-ending
procedural
path
of
capital
cases
does
more
to
undermine
the
criminal
justice
system
and
society's
confidence
in
it
than
it
does
to
protect
the
rights
of
those
who
have
killed
fellow
human
beings.
hopefully,
and
i
say
this
hopefully,
that
we
can
re-echo
the
statement
found
in
stein
v.
new
york
to
apply
to
the
state
of
florida,
that
the
people
down
there
in
that
state
are
entitled
to
some
measure
of
due
process
just
as
much
as
a
murdering
defendant
is
entitled
to
it.
thank
you.
