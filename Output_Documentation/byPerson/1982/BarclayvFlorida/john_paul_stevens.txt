justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nabrit,
may
i
ask
this
one
question?
is
it
your
legal
position
that
the
same,
if
there
is
one
permissible
aggravating
circumstance
that
has
been
properly
found,
or
are
you
taking
the
position
that
there
are
no
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
that
could
properly
be
found
on
this
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
if
the
florida
supreme
court
agreed
with
your
view
that
there
were
no
statutory
aggravating
circumstances,
they
also
would
have
set
aside
the
death
penalty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
there
another
possibility,
because
i
thought
when
you
answered
justice
o'connor
you
said
that
it
is
possible
to
read
the
lewis
case,
i
guess
it
is,
as
saying
that
when
the
jury
recommends
life
sentence
rather
than
death,
that
that
may
be
viewed
as
a
mitigating
circumstance
which
imposes
a
burden
on
being
sure
that
the
aggravating
outweigh.
now,
how
do
you
explain
lewis
if
you
make...
if
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--then
how
do
you
explain
lewis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
to
her,
if
i
recall,
that
that
may
mean
that
the
aggravating
outweighed
that
mitigating
circumstance,
but
then
you
have
just
now
told
us
that
you
can't
engage
in
weighing
when
there
are
some
non-statutory
aggravating
circumstances.
i'm
not
sure
your
arguments
are
consistent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
again,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
explain
lewis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
entirely
a
matter
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
whether
or
not
to
view
it
as
a
mitigating
factor
under
your
submission?
