mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
represent
the
petitioner,
elwood
barclay,
who
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
which
on
direct
appeal
affirmed
his
murder
conviction
and
a
death
sentence.
the
death
sentence
was
imposed
by
a
judge
of
the
circuit
court
of
duval
county
who
entered
written
sentencing
findings
that
are
the
focus
of
our
argument
here
today.
the
judge
disregarded
an
advisory
jury
verdict
which
recommended
that
barclay
be
given
life
imprisonment,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
affirmed.
barclay
lost
by
a
four-to-two
vote,
and
his
rehearing
petition
was
denied
by
an
equally
divided
court.
petitioner
brought
the
case
here
on
certiorari,
and
the
state
filed
a
brief
agreeing
that
this
court
should
review
the
case.
now,
let
me
begin
my
statement
of
the
case
before
i
describe
the
proceedings
in
the
court
below
by
briefly
recounting
five
points
about
the
florida
death
sentencing
statute.
it
is
a
statute
that
has
been
in
this
court
before.
it
was
the
statute
approved
in
the
proffit
case,
and
it
was
presented
as
having
five
procedural
safeguards.
first,
a
requirement
that
the
death
sentence
be
based
on
specific
written
findings
about
aggravating
circumstances,
which
was
supposed
to
serve
as
a
guide
for
the
sentencer's
discretion.
second,
the
statute
says
that
the
list
of
aggravating
circumstances
is
limited
to
eight
factors,
which
are
listed
in
the
statute,
and
six
of
those
i
will
just
refer
to
in
a
moment
are
involved
in
this
case.
second,
the
statute
provided
for
an
automatic
appeal,
a
review
in
which
the
florida
supreme
court
is
supposed
to
keep
the
sentencing
decisions
under
the
statute
in
line
with
the
statute.
next,
the
jury
had
a
special
role.
although
it
is
called
advisory,
the
jury...
the
jury's
judgment
is
supposed
to
prevail
under
the
florida
law
unless
no
reasonable
mind
could
disagree
that
the
death
sentence
should
be
imposed,
so
that
it
is...
and
finally,
the
idea
that
both
the
judge
and
jury
will
make
a
judgment
both
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
to
justify
a
death
sentence
as
well
as
a
weighing
of
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
so,
in
summary,
in
the
proffit
case,
the
court
said
that
after
a
verdict
of
guilt,
there
would
be
what
this
court
referred
to
as
an
informed,
focused,
guided,
and
objective
inquiry
into
the
question
of
whether
a
death
sentence
should
be
imposed,
and
that
would
be
at...
that
kind
of
objective
inquiry,
at
both
the
trial
and
appellate
levels.
now,
in
barclay's
case,
barclay
was
found
guilty
in
march
of
1975,
along
with
a
co-defendant
dougan.
he
was
found
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
in
the
death
of
one
stephen
orlando,
and
two
other
co-defendants
were
convicted
by
the
same
jury
of
second-degree
murder.
after
the
conviction,
at
the
penalty
trial,
the
jury
recommended
a
death
sentence
for
the
co-defendant
dougan,
but
life
imprisonment
for
barclay.
and
in
the
penalty
hearing,
the
state
argued
for
only
one
of
the
eight
statutory
aggravating
circumstances,
that
the
crime
was
heinous
atrocious,
and
cruel,
yet
the
state
made
no
effort
at
that
penalty
trial
to
convince
the
jury
that
any
of
the
other
seven
circumstances
applied.
and
the
majority
of
the
jury
came
back
with
a
written
finding,
a
written
finding
that
sufficient
aggravating
circumstances
did
not
exist
to
justify
a
death
sentence,
and
a
written
finding
that
sufficient
mitigating
circumstances
do
exist
which
outweigh
any
aggravating
circumstances.
the
judge
discharged
the
jury
and
directed
a
pre-sentence
investigation
report,
and
a
month
later
entered
his
own
written
findings,
and
five
years
later,
in
1980,
the
judge
substantially
repeated
the
findings
when
he
reimposed
the
sentence
after
it
was
first
vacated
on
the
basis
of
gardner
against
florida.
and
the
judge
found
seven
aggravating
circumstances.
now,
let
me
review
some
of
them.
the
first
one
is
quoted
in
our
brief
at
pages
29
and
30,
and
in
this
one...
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
29
and
the
bottom
of
page
30.
in
this
one
the
judge
found
as
an
aggravating
circumstance
that
barclay
had
some
prior
arrests,
and
he
had
a
prior
conviction
for
forgery
and
for
breaking
and
entering.
now,
it
is
acknowledged
by
the
state
that
this
was
an
error,
and
the
reason
is
that
what
the
judge
found
here
was
the
absence
of
one
of
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstances,
and
it
is
acknowledged
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
it
is
acknowledged
at
page
26,
i
think,
of
the
state's
brief,
that
under
the
state's
mikenas
case,
which
the
state
cites,
that
it
is
not
correct
to
make
the
absence
of
mitigating
circumstances
an
aggravating
circumstance,
so
that
that
was
a
finding
that
is
a
non-statutory
finding.
it
is
a
finding
of
an
aggravating
circumstance
that
is
not
listed
in
the
statute.
there
are
two
more
points
about
that.
one
is
that
mere
arrests
under...
and
again,
i
am
referring
to
florida
law
really
as
a
predicate
for
the
federal
arguments
that
i'll
make
later,
but
i
am
merely
trying
to
be
descriptive.
under
the
florida
law,
the
mere
arrests
don't
qualify
as
convictions,
even
if
there
is
a
relevant
crime
involved,
a
violent
crime
under
one
of
the
other
subsections,
and
convictions
can't
be
proved
by
the
presentence
investigation
report.
they
have
to
be
proved
by
the
state
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
at
the
penalty
trial.
now,
turning
to
the
next
two
aggravating
circumstances
found
by
the
court,
and
these
appear
in
our
brief
at
the
bottom
of
page
33
is
one,
and
the
next
one
is
over
at
page
36,
both
of
these
are
equally
flawed.
the
first
one
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
under
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
at
the
time
of
the
murder,
and
it
is
undisputed
that
barclay
at
the
time
of
the
murder,
barclay
was
not
in
prison,
he
was
not
supposed
to
be
in
prison,
he
was
not
on
parole,
he
was
not
on
probation,
none
of
that.
the
judge
found
that
he
was
not
imprisoned
at
the
top
of
page
34,
but
he
said
the
criminal
record
was
an
aggravating
circumstance.
so
what
the
judge
did
here
again
was
to
take
a
past
criminal
record
and
say
that
it
was
something
like,
it
resembled
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstance.
the
judge
did
something
similar
with
the
next
one,
at
page
36.
he
said
that...
this
provision
is
whether
or
not
the
defendant
had
been
convicted
of
a
felony
involving
the
use
or
threat
of
violence
to
the
person,
and
there
was
nothing
like
that
in
barclay's
record,
but
the
judge
said
that,
well,
he
had
been
convicted
of
breaking
and
entering,
and
the
judge
said,
it
is
not
known
if
that
prior
felony
involved
the
use
or
threat
of
violence,
but
he
said,
however,
such
crime
can
and
often
does
involve
violence.
so,
again,
he
found
something
really
not
in
terms
of
the
statute,
but
he
said,
well,
it
is
something
like
the
statute,
so
that
we
have
three
findings
by
the
court
which
really
aren't
in
terms
of
the
statute.
the
judge
said,
well,
i
am
finding
something
that
resembles
the
statute.
now,
the
fourth
one
is
whether
or
not
there
is...
the
murder
created
a
great
risk
of
death
to
many
persons.
and
this
one
is
discussed
in
our
brief
beginning
over
at
page
40,
and
the
judge
found
that...
the
judges
words,
"before,
during,
and
after
the
murder.
"
the
judge
said,
"there
was
a
great
risk
of
death
to
many
persons.
"
he
based
it
on...
he's
got
a
before
and
an
after,
but
he
doesn't
have
a
during
in
there.
before,
he
said,
the
defendants
drove
around
looking
for
a
victim,
and
it
is
undisputed
that
the
victim
was
killed
in
a
deserted,
lonely
road,
and
that
there
was
no
one
else
around,
but
the
judge
found
that
there
was
a
great
risk
of
death
to
many
persons
based
on
the
fact
that
before
finding
a
victim
in
a
lonely,
deserted
spot,
they
looked
at
and
decided
not
to
attack
people
in
groups
in
other
parts
of
the
city.
it
is
a
line
of
reasoning
that--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
--i
do,
your
honor.
there
is
no
basis
in
that
line
of
reasoning
for
distinguishing
any
case
from
among
many
cases
where
a--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
--well,
but
a
single
victim
who...
and
they
were
looking
for
one
alone.
i
mean,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
large
groups
of
people
against
death.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
in--
--well,
let
me
put
it
in
two...
let
me
suggest
there
are
two
doctrines.
one,
it
has
to
involve
a
lot
of
people,
and
two,
under
the
florida
law,
it
has
to
be
an
actual
risk
of
harm
or
death
based
on
the
nature
of
the
murder
or
the
conduct
immediately
surrounding
the
murder.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
argue
on
both
parts.
there
weren't
any
great
number
of
people.
there
was
nobody
around
at
the
time
of
the
murder.
and
the
decision
to...
the
decision
not
to
attack
a
large
group
of
people
can't
be
considered
as
endangering
a
large
group
of
people.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
correct,
and
our
argument--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
--no,
my
argument
is
that
the...
my
argument
is
a
federal
constitutional
one,
that
there
is
really
no
evidence
of
the
offense
or
the
statute
is
construed
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
vague
and
overbroad.
it
is
an
argument
based
on
the
godfrey
case
at
bottom,
but
the...
well,
let's
look
at
the
other
half
of
it
the
judge
relied
on.
the
judge
relied
on
something
that
happened
three
days
after
the
murder,
which
is
the
mailing
of
tapes,
tape
recordings
to
the
news
media,
and
said,
this
event
endangered
a
half-million
people
of
jacksonville.
the
problem
with
that
is
the
same
one.
there
is
nothing
in
the
evidence.
the
state
never
tried
to
prove
that
there
were
any
circumstances
that
made
this
dangerous.
this
wasn't
the
state's
theory.
and
so
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
a
notion
that
anyone
was
in
fact
endangered.
now,
there
are
three
other
aggravating
circumstances,
and
our
argument
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
48
to
63.
i
think
i
will
not
go
through
them,
because
my
time
is
limited,
and
i
will
instead
turn
to
the
main
two
legal
arguments.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
alone.
he
was
a
single
hitchhiker,
alone.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the...
well,
i
mean,
there
are...
i...
perhaps
not.
there
are
several
points.
one
is
that
two
people
even
wouldn't
be
enough
to
create
many
people,
to
equal
many
people
under
the
florida
law,
and
it
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
so,
our
argument
really
is
that
this
is
a
surprise
overbroad
construction
of
the
law
based
on...
as
the
law
has
been
interpreted
in
those
florida
cases.
now,
we
have
two
principal
arguments.
our
first
argument
is
that
the
trial
court
sentencing
findings
violated
barclay's
rights
under
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
and
the
argument
is,
as
i
said
before,
based
not
merely
on
the
notion
that
state
law
wasn't
followed,
but
based
on
the
idea
that
a
combination
of
non-statutory
aggravating
circumstances
and
the
factually
base
is
so
overbroad
construction
of
the
florida
statute
created
the
violation.
the
second
argument,
which
i
will
make
later,
is
really
in
the
nature
of
a
rebuttal
argument.
it
is
our
answer
to
the
state's
contention
that
even
if
we
are
correct
about
the
first
argument,
there
need
not
be
a
reversal,
that
the
error
is
in
some
way
harmless
or
it
does
not...
at
least
it
does
not
call
for
reversal.
the
main
theme
of
the
eighth
amendment
cases
from
furman
down
to
date
has
been
that
consistency
in
the
avoidance
of
arbitrariness
is
the
indispensable
element
to
the
constitutionality
of
capital
sentencing.
we
think
that
the
use
of
aggravating
circumstances
not
provided
in
the
statute
violates
the
eighth
amendment
because
it
makes
capital
sentencing
ungrounded
and
arbitrary,
and
to
establish
that,
we
point
to
the
three
main
purposes
that
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
are
supposed
to
serve.
the
list
of
statutory
circumstances
is
supposed
to
enable
the
legislature
to
decide
what
kinds
of
cases
deserve
the
death
penalty,
so
that
there
is
a
legislative
judgment
represented
by
the
limited
list
of
statutory
aggravating
circumstances.
and
if
you
take
an
example
from
our
case
of
the
prior
criminal
record,
the
first
one
the
judge
used,
the
legislature
of
florida
didn't
decide
that
if
someone
had
a
prior
record
for
a
prior
arrest
and
a
prior
record
for
forgery,
that
that
was
the
kind
of
aggravating
circumstance
that
justified
the
death
sentence.
the
second
purpose,
the
second
function
of
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
is
to
guide
the
sentencer's
exercise
of
discretion,
to
channel
the
discretion.
and
the
third
function
was
to
provide
a
basis
for
appellate
review,
so
that
the
appellate
court
would
have
a
way
of
looking
at
the
findings
and
attempting
to
ensure
that
similar
results
would
be
reached
in
similar
cases,
and
it
is
our
position
that
all
three
of
these
purposes
of
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
are
defeated
if
the
judge
is
allowed,
as
the
judge
in
this
case
did,
to
make
up
the
aggravating
circumstances
as
he
goes
along.
a
factor
that
one
judge
will
think
aggravating
will
be
evaluated
differently
by
another,
and
a
judge
presumably
will
change
his
view
as
time
passes,
so
that
the
danger
of
arbitrary
decision-making
is
reintroduced
into
the
process.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
we
take
the
latter
position,
your
honor,
but
our
argument
is
that
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
based
on
the
fact
that
even
if
only
some
of
them
are
outside
the
statute,
that
that
violates
the
eighth
amendment,
but
we
do
take
the
latter
position.
in
our
brief,
part
1-a
of
our
brief
addresses
each
of
the
seven
aggravating
circumstances
found
by
the
judge,
and
attempts
to
show
that
they
are
either
outside
the
statute
or
that
they
are
flawed
under
the
godfrey
guide.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
i
think
it
is
different.
i
think
there
is
nothing
in
the
florida
decisions
that
uses
the
threshold
language
or
the
language
in
the
recent
opinion
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
after
the
remand
in
the
zandt
case.
on
the
question
of
the
eighth
amendment,
in
summary,
i
guess,
our
position
is
that
the
safeguards
that
aggravating
circumstances
were
supposed
to
serve
under
the
statute
fell
through
in
this
case,
that
the
trial
court
really
didn't
live
up
to
what
was
represented
in
proffit,
to
assure
that
after
barclay's
conviction
there
really
would
be
an
informed,
focused,
guided,
and
objective
inquiry
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
would
be
sentenced
to
death,
and
i
think
that
none
of
those
adjectives
really
fairly
describe
the
findings
on
which
barclay
was
sentenced
to
death,
and
we
submit
that
the
sentence
violates
the
eighth
amendment.
now,
turning
to
the
second
point,
which
as
i
said
before
is
a
rebuttal
argument,
what
we
are
doing
in
part
2
of
our
brief
is
answering
the
attorney
general's
contention
that
florida's
rule,
which
is
embodied
in
its
elledge
case,
and
which
we
will
call
the
elledge
rule,
makes
it
appropriate
for
the
court
below
to
affirm
even
if
there
were
constitutional
errors,
even
if
there
was
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment,
or
several
violations
of
the
eighth
amendment
of
the
kind
that
we
complain
about
in
our
first
argument.
let
me
describe
the
elledge
rule.
the
elledge
case
provides
really,
as
we
see
it,
two
rules
for
dealing
with
a
case
where
the
trial
court
has
made
an
error,
either
an
error
by
considering
a
non-statutory
aggravating
circumstance
or
by
misapplying
one
of
the
statutory
circumstances,
but
where
there
are
other
valid
aggravating
factors
remaining
in
the
case.
now,
the
elledge
case
says
that
a
reversal
is
required,
that
that
situation
calls
for
a
reversal
if
there
are
statutory
mitigating
findings,
because
the
reviewing
court
can't
tell
whether
the
error
distorted
the
weighing
process,
so
that...
so,
to
be
clear,
under
florida
law,
it
is
error
to
consider
a
non-statutory
aggravating
circumstance,
and
they
call
it
error.
they
call
it
error
even
in
those
cases
where
they
don't
reverse.
and
the
cases
where
they
don't
reverse
are
under
the
second
half
of
the
elledge
rule,
and
that
is
that
the
death
sentence
will
be
affirmed
if
there
are
no
statutory
mitigating
circumstances,
no
statutory
mitigating
circumstances,
and
that
is
the...
the
state
law
premise
of
elledge
is
in
the
language
which
is
quoted
at
the
top
of
page
87
of
our
brief.
the
idea
is
that
so
long
as
there
are
some
statutory
aggravating
circumstances,
there
is
no
danger
that
non-statutory
circumstances
have
served
to
overcome
the
mitigating
circumstances
in
the
weighing
process,
in
other
words,
that
there
is
nothing
to
balance
against
whatever
aggravating
circumstances
remain,
and
therefore
it
is
called...
what
happens
is
what
the
attorney
general
refers
to
in
quoting
the
ford
case
as
a
presumption
of
death,
that...
the
state
quotes
the
same
language
we
do
from
ford
saying,
there
being
no
mitigating
factors
present,
death
is
presumed
to
be
the
appropriate
penalty.
now,
our
argument
is
that
that
rule
itself
violates
the
constitution.
it
is
a
rule
of
appellate
review,
a
procedural
rule
about
when
you
do
and
when
you
don't
reverse
in
the
presence
of
a
constitutional
error,
but
that
this
elledge
rule
violates
the
constitution.
assuming
that
elledge
is
a
presumption,
a
rule
of
law,
it
violates
lockett.
it
directly
violates
the
holding
of
the
lockett
case,
because
the
ohio
statute
in
lockett,
remember,
was
one
where
if
there
were
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
found,
and
there
was
no
statutory
mitigating
circumstance,
then
the
death
sentence
was
mandatory.
that
was
what
that
statute
did,
and
the
elledge
case
is
identical
in
the
way
it
ignores
the
non-statutory
mitigating
factors,
and
the
ford
case,
which
i
mentioned
before,
the
ford
case
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
makes
it
plain
that
that
is
the
way
the
elledge
rule
operates,
because
it
shows
that
the
elledge
rule
operates
even
if
there
are
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances
in
the
record.
there
is
a
presumption
of
death,
so
that
the
presumption
overrides
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances
just
like
the
ohio
statute
in
the
lockett
case
did.
the
second...
we
really
have
four
objections
to
the
elledge
rule,
and
the
first
one
i
have
just
mentioned,
which
is
based
on
lockett.
the
second
one
is
that
the
penalty
is
automatic
without
regard
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
aggravating
circumstances.
it
is
just
a
mechanical
rule,
and
that
that
violates
woodson
and
lockett,
which
require
there
be
a
judgment
about
the
appropriateness
of
the
death
penalty.
the
final
two
points
i
will
touch
on
quickly,
and
they
are
familiar
to
the
court.
assuming
that
elledge
is
not
really
strictly
a
mechanical
rule,
and
does
involve
some
judgment
or
some
guess
as
to
what
the
trial
court
would
have
done
in
the
circumstances,
then
we
have
the
stromberg
principle,
which
is
the
same
argument
that
is
before
the
court
in
the
example
of
stevens,
and
we
also
have
a
general
eighth
amendment
argument
that
that
kind
of
review
doesn't
meet
the
special
eighth
amendment
requirements
of
reliability
which
are
required
because
of
the
special
harshness
of
the
death
penalty.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
your
honor,
we--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
--well,
that's
right.
if
the
lewis
case...
we
make
the
argument
about
the
lewis
case,
your
honor,
in
our
brief
in
part
2-a...
part
2-b,
and
our
argument
is
that
if
lewis
is
the
florida
law,
and
lewis
was
reversed,
a
case
from
the
same
judge,
if
that
is
the
florida
law,
then
there
is
no
non-arbitrary
application
of
elledge
that
could
rule
against
barclay.
so
the
key
factor
in
lewis
was
the
jury
recommendation
of
life,
and
lewis
says
that
where
the
jury
recommends
life,
then
that
counts
as
if
it
was
a
finding
of
a
mitigating
factor.
lewis
is
ignored
in
some
of
the
other
cases.
if
lewis
is
the
law,
then
barclay
plainly
should
win.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
in
the
few
moments
i
have
left,
i
would
like
to
talk
about
how
i
see
the
harmless
error
concept
coming
into
this
case,
and
also
say
something
about
the
lewis
case.
i
think
a
factual
point
to
be
made
about
how
lewis
fits
in
here
is
that
there
were
facts
upon
which
the
jury
might
reasonably
have
found
that
there
were
both
statutory
and
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances
for
barclay.
the
argument
of
counsel
was
based
on
the
record
that
he
was
a
follower,
he
was
not
the
leader
of
the
group
of
people
who
were
convicted
of
the
murder.
his
family
status,
that
he
had
a
wife
and
five
children,
that
he
had
a
job,
that
he
was
a
young
man,
only
23
years
old.
and
a
major
factor
that
was
emphasized
to
the
jury
was
the
disparity
of
sentencing,
the
disparity
of
punishment
between
barclay
and
the
other
two
people
who
got
second-degree
murder
but
who
the
jury
knew
had
committed
two
murders,
that
were
sentenced
to
terms
of
imprisonment.
the
jury
also
might
very
well
have
based
its
finding
on
either
of
four
of
the
statutory
mitigating
factors,
the
age,
the
fact
that
the
state
did
not
prove
the
prior
record.
they
might
have
found
lesser
participation,
and
they
may
have
found
domination
by
dougan.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state's
distinction
of
lewis
is
not
correct.
lewis
is
an
application
of
the
elledge
rule.
it
is
an
appellate
level
rule
and
not
a
trial
level
rule.
the
lewis
case
was
sent
back
for
resentencing,
the
same
judge,
and
the
same
counsel
representing
the
state.
mr.
allbritton
argued
it,
and
judge
olaff
decided
lewis,
and
he
made
the
same
kinds
of
errors
he
did
here,
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
lewis
because
three
of
these
same
kinds
of
aggravating
circumstances
were
reversed.
and
the
ground
for
a
remand
in
lewis
was
merely
that
there
was
a
jury,
the
remaining
aggravating
circumstance
had
to
be
weighed
against
a
jury's
life
recommendation.
now,
turning
to
the
harmless
error
point,
this
is
not
really
a
harmless
error
case
in
the
ordinary
sense,
in
the
chapman
sense.
there
is
no
submission
by
the
state...
there
is
no
inquiry
by
the
state
into
the
question
of
prejudice.
certainly
the
court
below
didn't
rely
on
harmless
error.
they
didn't
acknowledge
that
there
was
any
error
at
all.
so
whether
you
call
it
the
elledge
rule
or
harmless
error,
it
is
really
the
same
thing.
it
is
harmless
error
principles
attempted
to
be
used
in
justification
for
a
presumption,
a
legal
rule,
the
elledge
rule,
and
our
four
objections
to
the
elledge
rule,
i
think,
pertain
whether
you
call
it
harmless
error
or
not.
the
counsel
did
not
in
argument
and
in
his
brief
disagree
with
our
characterization
of
elledge
as
ignoring,
elledge
and
ford,
ignoring
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances,
and
the
only
exception
to
that
is
lewis,
is
the
lewis
case.
lewis
is
the
law,
as
i
said
before.
there
is
no
non-arbitrary
application
of
the
law
that
would
convict
barclay.
but
even
examining
this
case
under...
if
we
ever
got
to
trying
to
apply
the
chapman
v.
california
doctrine
to
this
case,
considering
the
special
care
and
reliability
required
in
capital
sentencing,
the
fact
that
the
death
sentence
was
by
no
means
foreordained
in
this
case.
there
is
no
way
that
you
could
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
error,
the
multiple
constitutional
errors,
we
submit,
that
were
the
basis
of
the
sentence
of
elwood
barclay
could
be
harmless.
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
