justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that...
do
you
feel
that
is
a
totally
unreasonable
finding
on
the
part
of
the
judge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
suggest
my
own
thought
that
occurs
to
me.
in
the
case
of
a
premeditated
murder,
you
could
say
that,
you
know,
there
was
malice
aforethought,
et
cetera,
but
the
murderer
was
presumably
looking
only
for
one
victim.
he
wasn't
just
going
randomly.
but
here
one
gets
the
impression
from
the
judge's
findings
that
these
people
were
looking
not
for
one
victim,
but
for
almost
anybody
they
came
across
that
met
a
certain
description.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
feel
that
the
florida
law
wasn't
designed
to
produce
a
great
number
of
people
even
though
they
might
have
been
individually
isolated
or
by
themselves?
