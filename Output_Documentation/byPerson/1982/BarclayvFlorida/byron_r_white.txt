but
if
he
finds
some
aggravating
factors,
he
may
impose
the
death
penalty,
even
though
some
of
his
aggravating
factors
may
be
set
aside
on
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assuming
no
mitigating
factors
at
all,
in
florida,
i
take
it
your
submission
is
that
the
judge
may
consider
in
deciding
whether
to
impose
the
death
penalty
statutory
as
well
as
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be.
nevertheless,
the
law
of
florida
at
the
time
of
this
sentence
was
that
the
judge
could
use
non-statutory
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
should
judge
this
case
as
though
it
still
was
the
law.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
harmless
error,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
the...
is
that
the
basis
for
the
judgment
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
purpose
of
withdrawing
the
use
of
non-statutory
aggravating
circumstances
as--
justice
byron
r.
white
--as
factors
then?
would
it
always
be
harmless
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
know
this
one
is
one
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
you
know
that
this
one
is
one
of
them,
if
you
applied
the
current
florida
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
rowing
upstream.
that
was
just
a
dissent.
