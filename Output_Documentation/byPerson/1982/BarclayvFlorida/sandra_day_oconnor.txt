justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
nabrit,
the
florida
supreme
court,
though,
obviously
found
that
as
a
matter
of
florida
law
it
met
their
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
on
that
fourth
factor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
are
not
asking
us
to
say
that
the
florida
law
is
something
else,
are
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
allbritton,
do
you
plan
to
address
the
lewis
case,
as
justice
blackmun
inquired
about,
which
appeared
to
hold
that
if
a
jury
found
that
the
defendant
should
be
sentenced
to
life,
that
was
treated
as
a
mitigating
circumstance
then,
and
required
a
different
action
when
it
was
challenged
by
the
defendant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
allbritton,
would
you
characterize
the
florida
scheme
as
a
threshold
scheme
like
that
of
georgia,
or
a
balancing
scheme?
it
wasn't
clear
to
me
from
your
brief.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
the
florida
scheme,
if
the
trial
judge
found
no
mitigating
circumstances,
and
found
one
or
more
aggravating
circumstances,
is
the
trial
judge
required
to
impose
the
death
penalty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
he
just
balances
all
the
facts--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
your
scheme.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
unless
lewis
required
that
the
jury
recommendation
be
considered
as
a
mitigating
factor.
