yes.
mr.
nabrit,
do
you
have
any
thoughts
as
to
how
the
florida
system
compares
with
georgia's?
i
regard
georgia
as
kind
of
a
threshold
state,
if
i
can
describe
it
that
way,
so
far
as
aggravating
circumstances
are
concerned,
and
i
wondered
if
you
felt
florida
was
the
same
or
was
different.

mr.
nabrit,
before
you
sit
down,
do
you
have
any
special
comment
about
lewis
against
the
state?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
reason
i
ask
this
is
that
your
opponent
doesn't
cite
it
at
all,
and
you
cite
it
profusely.
from
his
brief
it
is
as
though
it
doesn't
exist.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
you
will
explain
why--
