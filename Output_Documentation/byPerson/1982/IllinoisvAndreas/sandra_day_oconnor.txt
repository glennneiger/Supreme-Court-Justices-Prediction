well,
certainly
if
it
had
been
a
cardboard
carton,
for
example,
and
a
half
an
hour
had
elapsed,
it
would
be
pretty
easy,
if
it
were
not
within
the
officer's
view,
to
change
the
contents
of
the
container,
would
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
the
container
here
one
to
which
items
could
have
been
added
within
the
half
hour
or
so?
perhaps
not
possible
to
take
out
all
of
the
contents
of
the
table,
but
could
other
items
have
been
added?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
are
you
arguing
an
extended
border
search
rather
than
a
controlled
delivery?
i
don't
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
are
arguing
the
controlled
delivery?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
their
argument
is
that
you
lose
the
expectation
of
privacy
so
long
as
there's
some
surveillance
of
it
thereafter
until
the
point
that
it's
seized.
that's
how
i
understand
the
argument.
and
the
tough
part
of
this
case
is
that
break
in
time
and
the
level
of
certainty
that's
required
to
be
sure
something
hasn't
been
taken
out
or
added.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
level
of
certainty
do
you
think
the
cases
show
has
to
be
applied?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
if
the
door
were
closed
for
30
seconds
that
that
would
somehow
magically
change
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
the
fun
we
have
in
asking
questions.
[laughter]
that's
what
we're
here
for,
to
test
your
arguments
with
hypothetical
questions.
counsel,
when
you
get
a
package
from
overseas
and
you
are
an
average
intelligent
person,
don't
you
assume
that
someplace
along
the
line
the
customs
agents
have
taken
a
look
at
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
suppose
we
do
adopt
it.
then
the
question
still
becomes
whether
that
break
in
time
is
sufficient
to
say
that
there
isn't
a
controlled
delivery.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
might
that
not
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
container
and
the
likelihood
that
it
could
have
been...
something
taken
out
or
added
in
that
interval?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
none
of
the
controlled
delivery
cases
have
required
absolute
certainty.
that's
just
not
an
argument
that's
a
winner.
it's
a
question
of
the
level
of
certainty
you're
going
to
require.
is
it
going
to
be
probable
cause,
is
it
going
to
be
substantial
likelihood,
is
it
going
to
be
reasonable
certainty,
what
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
could
fit
the
definition
of
a
controlled
delivery
under
any
view,
couldn't
it,
until
the
arrival
at
the
apartment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
think
he
can
rely
on
what
customs
officials
told
him?
