mr.
richard
a.
devine
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
law
enforcement
officials
must
obtain
a
search
warrant
after
a
controlled
delivery
has
been
made
to
respondent
following
a
lawful
customs
search
revealing
marijuana
within
the
container
delivered.
the
essential
facts
are
as
follows.
on
february
21st,
1979,
a
customs
agent
stationed
at
o'hare
international
airport
inspected
a
shipment
from
calcutta,
india,
to
respondent
consignee.
he
did
this
in
a
customs
bonded
area.
the
container
inspected
was
sheet
metal,
approximately
four
feet
square
and
12
to
18
inches
thick.
there
were
two
locks
affixed
to
the
container,
which
the
customs
agent
opened
by
keys
which
were
accompanying
the
airline
documents.
inside
the
container
he
found
a
table
top
approximately
three
feet
in
diameter
and
eight
to
ten
inches
thick.
he
removed
the
table
from
the
container
and
drilled
several
holes
in
it,
removing
from
inside
a
substance,
which
he
field
tested
and
found
to
be
marijuana.
he
then
contacted
agents
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration.
soon
thereafter
dea
agent
labek
arrived
at
o'hare
airport.
he
saw
both
the
table
and
the
container
in
the
customs
bonded
area.
he
also
performed
his
own
field
test
on
contents
from
the
table
top,
which
again
showed
marijuana.
on
february
22nd,
the
next
day,
dea
agent
labek
picked
up
the
container,
which
had
been
resealed
at
that
time,
from
the
customs
area
at
o'hare.
he
was
dressed
as
a
delivery
man
and
took
the
table
and
the
container
to
61
east
goethe
street
in
chicago,
illinois,
the
address
of
respondent
given
on
the
airline
documents.
there
he
met
officers
of
the
chicago
police
department,
including
police
officer
wayne
lipsek,
who
was
also
dressed
as
a
delivery
man.
agent
labek
met
an
individual
in
the
apartment
building
at
that
address
who
identified
himself
as
respondent.
the
two
walked
outside
and
met
officer
lipsek.
while
they
were
unloading
the
container
from
the
back
of
the
van,
respondent
noted
that
there
was
a
table
top
inside
and
that
he
had
helped
pack
it.
the
three
carried
the
container
into
the
apartment
building
and
took
it
to
the
second
floor.
respondent
directed
the
officers
to
leave
the
container
in
the
hallway
immediately
outside
his
apartment.
they
did
so.
after
leaving
the
container
outside
the
apartment,
they
went
around
the
corner
and
observed
respondent
take
the
container
inside
the
apartment.
while
officer
lipsek
left
to
obtain
a
state
search
warrant,
agent
labek
maintained
surveillance
within
the
apartment
building.
soon
after
respondent
took
the
container
into
the
apartment,
agent
labek
saw
him
come
out
of
the
apartment,
go
to
a
window
in
the
hallway,
look
to
the
side
and
look
down,
turn
and
go
back
into
the
apartment.
approximately
30
to
45
minutes
later,
respondent
came
out
of
the
apartment
with
the
container.
at
that
time
he
was
arrested.
agent
labek
was
present
at
time
time
of
the
arrest
and
agent
labek
later
testified
that
the
container
with
respondent
at
that
time
was
the
same
container
that
had
been
delivered
to
him.
officer
lipsek
was
radioed
and
told
to
return
to
the
scene.
he
did
so,
and
officer
lipsek
and
agent
labek
accompanied
the
container
to
chicago
police
headquarters.
at
chicago
police
headquarters
the
container
was
opened,
the
table
top
was
found
within,
the
substance
was
removed
from
within
the
table
top
and
again
field
tested
and
found
to
be
marijuana.
officer
lipsek
was
present
during
this
entire
process
and
testified
that
the
container
which
was
opened
was
the
same
container
that
had
been
delivered
to
respondent.
respondent
was
charged
with
possession
of
controlled
substances
and
with
possession
of
a
controlled
substance
with
intent
to
deliver.
the
trial
court
granted
respondent's
motion
to
suppress
evidence.
the
illinois
appellate
court
affirmed
that
decision.
the
state's
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
denied,
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
no
warrant
was
required
for
the
second
opening
of
the
container
at
police
headquarters.
there
had
been
a
lawful
customs
search
which
clearly
established
that
contraband
was
within
the
container,
and
this
knowledge
was
within
law
enforcement's
area
of
understanding.
there
was
then
a
controlled
delivery
of
the
container
and
its
contents,
during
which
the
officers
maintained
reasonably
continuous
surveillance.
thus
the
second
search
constituted
not
a
new
search
but
a
reassertion
of
control
over
that
which
the
government
had
already
seized.
this
court
has
for
many
years
and
in
many
cases
held
that
a
search
at
customs
is
reasonable
by
the
fact
that
it
occurs
at
the
border.
it
does
not
require
probable
cause,
it
does
not
require
a
warrant.
thus
any
individual
shipping
a
container
which
will
cross
a
border
has
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
that
the
container
will
not
be
searched.
at
the
time
that
the
search
took
place
here
at
customs,
it
was
performed
by
a
customs
agent,
it
was
performed
in
a
customs
area.
it
revealed
contents
which
were
contraband
and
field
tests
confirmed
that
it
was
contraband.
at
that
stage
the
government
had
the
right
to
seize
the
container
and
its
contents.
they
also
had
the
right
to
conduct
a
controlled
delivery,
which
they
did.
a
controlled
delivery
is
an
accepted
police
activity
where
there
is
delivery
by
law
enforcement
and
there
is
a
serving
of
a
legitimate
law
enforcement
purpose.
in
this
case,
two
purposes
could
be
to
confirm
the
identity
of
the
recipient
of
the
container
and
also
to
identify
any
confederates
which
might
be
involved
in
the
criminal
enterprise.
thus
the
seizure
had
taken
place
at
the
time
of
the
initial
legal
search
and
it
remained
in
the
government's
constructive
control
throughout.
here
there
was
a
valid
controlled
delivery.
markings
were
not
necessary
on
this
container
because
it
was
of
a
distinctive
type.
it
was
a
four
by
four
metal
container
used
for
shipping,
used
to
ship
large
objects.
therefore
it
was
sufficiently
distinctive
that
no
special
markings
on
the
outside
or
in
the
interior
were
necessary.
the
law
enforcement
agencies
involved
had
collective
knowledge
that
was
sufficient
through
the
continuum
of
delivery
here
so
that
there
was
no
break.
all
relevant
actions
taken
from
the
time
of
the
search
at
customs
were
by
customs
agents,
chicago
police
department
officers,
or
agents
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration.
the
critical
point
here
is
the
30
to
45-minute
interval
during
which
respondent
had
the
container
in
his
apartment.
it
is
our
position
that
this
did
not
create
any
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
on
the
part
of
respondent
in
the
contents
of
the
container.
the
fact
of
possession
clearly
does
not
defeat
a
controlled
delivery,
because
it
takes
place
in
almost
every
controlled
delivery.
at
least
for
some
point,
the
individual
recipient
does
have
the
package.
constant
observation
of
the
package
and
the
recipient
are
not
required
in
a
controlled
delivery.
quite
frequently
during
this
process,
there
is
transfer
from
one
agent
to
another,
law
enforcement
agency
to
another,
by
a
common
carrier.
it
is
not
required
and
it
has
never
been
required
in
these
cases
that
there
be
continuous
government
observation
of
the
object
while
it
is
being
transferred.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
i
think,
your
honor,
the
situation
might
be
different
if
you
had
a
common
suitcase
which
could
not
be
clearly
identified
and
which
would
allow
readily
easy
transfer
of
the
contents.
we
submit,
however,
that
when
you
have
a
container
which
is
clearly
identified
and
there
is
reasonably
continuous
surveillance
by
law
enforcement
officials,
with
that
knowledge
and
then
a
retaking
after
a
relatively
short
interval,
that
the
second
taking
is
merely
a
reassertion
of
control.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
court
could,
because
of
the
unusual
nature
of
the
type
of
search
which
can
occur
at
customs
under
the
law
and
which
can
give
law
enforcement
officials
specific
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
the
container,
could
take
the
position
that
once
the
government
finds
contraband
in
such
containers
and
the
container
is
identified,
even
if
it
were
a
suitcase,
were
clearly
identifiable,
then
government,
if
it
maintained
reasonably
continuous
surveillance,
could
retake
that
container
and
open
it
up
because
there
had
been
that
specific
knowledge
and
there
had
not
been
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
about
the
contents
in
placing
it
at
an
international
border.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
i
think
that
the
time
factor,
justice
rehnquist,
plus
the
type
of
container
are
items
to
consider.
but
i
think
the
basic
standard
which
the
court
could
look
at
is
one
that
is
premised
on
the
actual
knowledge
at
customs.
of
course,
if
it
were
a
container
that
could
easily
be
changed
and
were
in
the
specific
control
of
respondent
for
a
long
period
of
time,
those
are
considerations
which
the
court
would
have
to
apply
to
the
case.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
that's
correct,
justice
marshall.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
at
the
time...
the
shipment
was
made
from
calcutta,
india,
to
chicago
via
lufthansa
airlines.
the
lufthansa
documents
for
the
shipment
included
the
keys
to
open
the
container.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
presumably
for
customs
to
open
it,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
here
both
chadwick
and
sanders,
which
were
cases
cited
by
the
illinois
appellate
court
in
ruling
on
this
matter,
both
noted
that
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
relates
to
what
is
known
about
the
container.
chadwick
specifically
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
container
itself
is
known
to
the
public
and
can
be
seen
by
the
public.
here
law
enforcement
had
seen
the
contents
of
the
container.
in
the
sanders
decision
it
was
noted
that
certain
types
of
containers,
such
as
gun
cases,
do
not
create
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
because
of
their
nature.
if
that
is
true
with
a
gun
case
where
the
contents
are
not
known,
it
is
certainly
true
of
a
situation
such
as
this,
where
law
enforcement
has
with
validity
gone
into
the
container
in
a
reasonable
way
and
determined
what
the
contents
are.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
i
certainly
think...
pardon
me,
your
honor.
i
certainly
think
in
this
case
if
one
applied
just
about
any
reasonable
test,
such
as
the
substantial
likelihood
test
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general--
mr.
richard
a.
devine
--i
think
it
is
a
narrow
but
proper
holding
in
this
case,
your
honor.
i
think
if
applied
to
this
case
with
the
type
of
container
you
have,
with
a
table
inside
it,
and
inside
of
the
table,
hardly
easily
accessible,
you
find
the
contraband,
and
if
you
couple
that
with
the
suspicious
behavior
of
respondent
in
going
to
the
window,
looking
out,
making
a...
whether
a
coast
is
clear
look,
and
then
coming
out
with
the
container,
coupling
all
those
items
together,
plus
the
fact
that
the
police
after
seizing
the
container
could
tell
whether
it
weighed
relatively
the
same,
i
think
all
those
things
clearly
suggest
here
that
there
is
very
little
likelihood
of
change.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
we
think
we
meet
that
test,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
i
would
argue...
i
would
argue
for
more,
mr.
justice
stevens,
yes.
i
would
suggest
that
where
you
have
a
situation
of
actual
knowledge
by
law
enforcement,
finding
contraband--
mr.
richard
a.
devine
--if
the
container
is
identified,
either
because
it's
distinctive,
because
it's
marked,
or
because
a
beeper,
for
example,
might
be
placed
in
it.
yes,
if
law
enforcement
at
that
point
has
nothing
affirmative
presented
to
them
to
take
away
their
legitimate
expectation
that
that
container
still
has
contraband
within,
we
think
it
can
be
searched
without
a
warrant.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
i
think
essentially,
chief
justice
burger,
it
would
amount
to
that,
but
i
would
phrase
it
in
the
sense,
there
is
nothing
that
happened
that
took
away
from
their
actual
knowledge
because
of
the
reasonably
continuous
surveillance,
the
type
of
container,
and
the
amount
of
time
that
was
involved
here.
having
had
actual
knowledge,
it
was
certainly
legitimate
for
them
after
this
container
came
out,
with
all
the
facts
that
i've
described,
for
law
enforcement
to
seize
the
container
and
to
search
it
without
a
warrant.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
i
think
the
ease
of
ability
to
change
the
contents,
justice
o'connor,
is
a
factor
to
consider.
and
it
is
one
of
the
things
that
i
would
suggest
could
be
brought
forward
as
an
affirmative
statement
by
defendant
or
respondent
to
show
that
there
were
reasonable
factors
that
law
enforcement
people
could
be
aware
of
to
change
their
understanding
of
what
might
be
in
that
container.
however,
if
there
were
a
beeper
inside
the
cardboard
box
that
might
create
a
different
situation.
i
think
this
kind
of
case
does
require
an
examination
of
all
the
circumstances
that
are
involved,
but
i
think
the
standard
i
suggested
provides
a
basis
for
looking
at
those
various
factors.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
i
would
expect
that,
based
on
the
size
of
the
container
and
the
size
of
the
table,
it
might
have
been
possible
to
put
something
in.
but
at
the
same
time,
i
would,
looking
at
the
type
of
container,
not
expect
that
someone
would
readily
use
that
as
a
piece
of
hand
luggage.
it
is
obviously
designed
for
shipping
large
items
and,
based
on
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
i
think
it
is
highly
remote
that
anything
was
done
that
would
have
been
a
transfer
of
a
large
item
of
contraband
or
something
other
than
that
inside
that
container,
and
then
have
it
come
out
and
be
approximately
the
same
weight
it
was
when
it
went
in.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
the
street
value
estimate
by
the
chicago
police
officer
on
the
scene
was
$100,000.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
the
weight
does
not
show
up
on
any
of
the
common
law
record
at
this
stage,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
yes,
hashish.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
it
is
my
understanding
from
the
record,
justice
powell,
that
a
drill
was
used
by
the
customs
agent,
probably
on
the
underneath
side
of
the
table,
to
open
up
holes,
first
to
determine
if
it
was
hollow,
and
then
to
remove
an
amount
of
substance
that
could
be
field
tested.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
anything
such
as
a
drill
was
found
with
the
container.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well--
mr.
richard
a.
devine
--we
don't
know
from
the
record,
justice
white.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
it
is
our
understanding
from
ramsey
and
other
cases
that
go
back
to
boyd,
justice
marshall--
mr.
richard
a.
devine
--than
a...
i
didn't
give
you
that
authority,
justice
marshall.
[laughter]
i
think
the
case--
mr.
richard
a.
devine
--there
may
be...
certainly
this
court
commented
in
ramsey
in
a
footnote
that
allowing
the
customs
agent
to
inspect
in
effect
any
baggage,
any
person
that
comes
across
the
international
border--
mr.
richard
a.
devine
--yes,
and
then
replugging
the
holes
by
the
customs
agent
after
the
drilling
took
place.
but
the
case
is
quite
clear
that
customs
can
inspect
a
table
top
or
anything
that
comes
through
to
determine
if
in
fact,
as
here,
there
is
contraband
inside.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
well,
i
think
that
i
would
cite
to
ramsey,
which
this
court
has
made,
a
decision
which
this
court
has
made.
i
would
cite
to
section
1582
of
the
u.s.
statutes,
the
u.s.
code,
and
the
regulations
adopted
thereunder.
they
don't
specifically
say
you
can
drill
inside,
but
they
do
give
customs
the
clear
power
to
search
any
baggage
and
any
person
that
comes
in.
now,
that
has
to
be
done
reasonably,
i
would
suggest,
and
that
to
just
bash
open
any
piece
of
baggage
that
came
through,
as
this
court
perhaps
noted
in
ramsey,
is
not
something
which
the
court
has
approved.
but
this
was
done
reasonably.
drills
were
used
which
customs
agents
apparently
frequently
use.
the
table
was
plugged
up
again.
presumably
it
was
done
on
the
under
side
so
it
would
not
damage
the
table.
and
in
fact,
if
you
did
not
do
that,
if
you
did
not
have
the
authority
to
do
that,
any
time
someone
wanted
to
be
sure
they
could
smuggle
something
into
the
country
they
would
put
it
inside
something
like
a
table
top.
so
i
think
it
is
historically
and
under
the
case
law
quite
well
established
that
customs
can
do
what
is
necessary
to
make
a
reasonable
inspection.
we
are
not
arguing
here
for
a
controlled
delivery
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement.
rather,
we
are
arguing
that
the
customs
exception
quite
clearly
applies
here
and
that
after
that
inspection
at
customs
had
reveal
contraband
within
the
table
top
and
it
was
placed
back
in
the
container,
law
enforcement
could
carry
out
a
controlled
delivery
of
that
container
by
maintaining
reasonably
continuous
surveillance,
and
under
all
the
circumstances
that
have
been
described
here
allow
for
a
second
search,
which
is
not
a
new
search
but
rather
a
reassertion
of
control
by
government.
this
court
has
in
other
contexts,
such
as
edwards
and
tyler,
noted
that
constant
possession,
constant
visual
surveillance
of
an
area
searched,
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
retain
the
custody
that
is
sufficient
to
allow
government
to
go
in.
specifically,
in
tyler
this
court
noted
that
a
second
search
several
hours
later
of
an
arson
scene
constituted
a
continuation
of
the
fire
personnel's
activity
on
the
scene,
and
that
it
was
not
a
new
search
and
not
subject
to
a
warrant
requirement.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
the
firemen
had
left
the
scene,
chief
justice
burger,
and
came
back
some
four
hours
later
after
the
smoke
and
steam
had
cleared
away,
made
one
search,
went
away
again
and
came
back
an
hour
later.
and
the
court
held
that
the
early
morning
searches
several
hours
later
were
a
continuation
of
the
first
search.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
that
argument,
justice
o'connor,
was
made
by
the
solicitor
general
and,
while
we
certainly
believe
we
could
withstand
analysis
under
an
extended
border
search
theory,
illinois
is
basically
arguing
the
customs
exception
plus
the
controlled
delivery.
we
think
the
difference
here
is
there
was
an
actual
search
at
the
border,
whereas
in
the
extended
border
search
cases
there
has
not
been
and
you
are
setting
forth--
mr.
richard
a.
devine
--we
are
not
arguing
a
controlled
delivery
exception,
your
honor.
we
are
arguing
a
customs
exception
plus
a
legitimate
controlled
delivery.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
i
think
that's
certainly
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
in
fact,
i
think
the
most
common
way
they
occur
is
if
a
common
carrier
has
for
some
reason
had
cause
to
inspect
an
item
coming
aboard
a
train
or
a
plane
and
the
police
officials
see
it
in
plain
view.
that
seems
to
be
numberwise
the
most
common
way
that
this
happens.
here
the
search
at
the
police
headquarters
was
not
an
incremental
intrusion
into
an
area
of
privacy
concerning
which
respondent
had
legitimate
expectations.
when
one
is
balancing
that
lack
of
intrusion,
lack
of
any
further
intrusion
beyond
what
had
already
been
searched,
against
the
burden
which
would
be
placed
on
law
enforcement
by
requiring
that
a
warrant
be
obtained,
the
balance
clearly
is
in
the
favor
of
law
enforcement.
we
would
therefore
pray
that
this
court
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
appellate
court
and
remand
this
matter
to
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
for
further
proceedings.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
a.
devine
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
just
like
to
respond
to
two
points.
with
regard
to
the
earlier
so-called
interval
in
the
controlled
delivery,
the
only
point
really
that
respondent
is
making
is
that
agent
labek
was
not
present
watching
the
container
at
the
time
that
the
customs
agent
picked
up
the
table
top
and
put
it
back
in.
the
container
was
resealed
and
remained
in
a
customs
bonded
area,
from
which
agent
labek
picked
it
up
the
next
morning.
he
had,
as
we
have
noted,
seen
that
table
top,
seen
that
container
the
prior
day,
in
fact
tested
the
substance
from
the
table
top.
to
impose
the
kind
of
standard
of
continuity
by
one
individual
in
law
enforcement
to
justify
a
controlled
delivery,
as
respondent
would,
would
in
effect
remove
controlled
deliveries.
it's
a
totally
absurd
standard,
i
think
is
the
only
way
to
really
characterize
it.
the
second
point
is
that
respondent
refers
to
katz
and
going
into
the
telephone
booth.
well,
the
man
going
into
the
telephone
booth
did
not
bring
a
container
with
him
which
had
been
inspected
and
which
had
shown
that
the
contents
were
contraband.
the
only
reason
at
all
that
there
was
any
added
factor
here
by
going
into
the
apartment
was
under
payton
principles.
there
was
nothing
about
the
container
or
the
contents
that
required
the
police
to
go
for
a
warrant.
it
was
the
location
of
that
container
in
the
apartment
which
the
police,
in
exercising
professional
judgment
and
acting
as
we
would
want
them
to
act,
sought
a
warrant
to
enter.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
container,
the
contents,
or
anything
that
might
have
happened
to
either
the
container
or
the
contents.
thank
you
very
much.
