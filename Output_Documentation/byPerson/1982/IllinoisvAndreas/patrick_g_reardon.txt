mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
have
reiterated
today
that
the
facts
of
this
case
show
what
they've
called
a
controlled
delivery,
and
i
agree
with
some
of
the
questions
and
with
the
petitioner
when
he
said
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
facts.
i
think
the
facts
in
this
case
do
not
show
that
a
controlled
delivery
occurred,
regardless
of
whether
we
accept
the
reasoning
of
the
controlled
delivery
as
an
exception
to
needing
a
warrant.
the
facts
that
we
look
to
to
that
position
are
the
following--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--well,
i
think
they
have
based,
and
i
think
the
illinois
appellate
court
based
its
understanding
of
a
controlled
delivery
upon
the
cases
in
the
various
courts
of
appeals,
such
as--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--i
think
that
a
controlled
delivery,
if
there
is
one,
must
entail
a
constant,
close
surveillance
and
control
over
the
contents
that
are
to
be
seized,
at
whatever
time
they
are
eventually
seized
and
taken
into
police
control
permanently.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
i
think
that
over
the
years
the
cases
have
given
us
imaginative
ways
that
the
government
has
found
to
do
that.
one
is
that
when
a
package
is
found
the
government,
either
by
virtue
of
plain
view
doctrine
or
customs
search
or
whatever,
sees
the
contents
of
the
container,
they
then
mark
that
container
in
such
a
way
so
that
at
a
later
time
when
they
have
delivered
the
container
into
someone
else's
possession
and
watched
it
closely,
as
all
the
courts
have
demanded,
they
can
then
tell
whether
that
container
has
been
opened
or
closed,
therefore
whether
the
contents
of
that
container
are
the
same.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
at
the
time
of
the
customs
search
apparently
the
keys
were
attached
by
lufthansa
as
a
part
of
the
shipment
and
were
with
the
tin
package,
so
that
when
it
came
to
customs
all
the
customs
agent
had
to
do
was
to
take
the
keys
and
open
the
package.
once
the
package--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--well,
there's
no
evidence
as
to
even
whether
the
container
at
the
time
it
was
delivered
was
in
fact
locked.
all
that's
said
is
the
container
was
closed
and
opaque
at
the
time
it
was
delivered.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that,
on
the
issue
of
bringing
the
container
from
the
customs
depot
to
the
address
on
goethe
street,
that
there
are
several
occasions
when
we
have
problems
with
the
analysis
of
the
facts
that
has
gone
before.
for
example--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--well,
i
think
you're
asking
me
to
go
beyond
the
facts
in
this
case,
which
i
think
give
us
an
opportunity
to
clearly
see
a
line.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
possibly
that
would
be
the
way
this
court
could
go.
but
in
this
case
there
is
such
a
bright
line
that
i
don't
think
there's
any
problem
with
drawing
it.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
there's
at
least
a
half
hour
to
45
minutes
where
the
container
is
not
just
handed
to
someone
and
then
that
someone,
as
in
many
cases,
walks
out
of
the
airport
with
agents
trailing
him
and
following
him
by
radio.
the
container
is
handed
to
him
at
the
door
of
his
own
home,
an
apartment
but
nevertheless
a
home,
a
fourth
amendment
protected
area.
he
went
inside
that
home
with
a
closed
container
and
closed
the
door,
and
at
that
moment
i
think
that
he
manifested
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
and
during
an
interim
of
a
half
an
hour,
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
there
was
any
particular
problem
emptying
out
that
container.
i
take
exception
to
the
statements
of
the
petitioner
on
that
score.
there
was
no
information
given
to
us
that
there
was
any
difficulty
in
opening
this
ordinary
shipping
container
that
lufthansa
uses
to
ship
furniture
and
to
take
out
the
table.
there
was
no
evidence
at
any
time
as
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
heavy
object
or
a
difficult
object
to
move.
that
is
not
in
the
record.
in
fact,
if
we
are
to
look
to
the
record
for
anything
at
all,
it
is
the
statement
given
to
us
by
agent
labek
that
he
says
the
respondent
gave
him,
and
that
is.
oh,
it's
not
heavy,
i'll
take
it
myself.
i
packed
it
myself
before.
now
that's
what
agent
labek
tells
us.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
there's
no
evidence
that
it
was
even
full
at
the
time
it
was
seized,
other
than
it
was,
of
course,
later
opened.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
oh,
it
certainly
did.
but
at
the
time
of
arrest--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--but
at
the
time
that
is
relevant
to
the
seizure
and
to
the
opening
of
that
container,
no
evidence
has
been
given
to
us
that
the
police
weighed
it,
checked
the
weight
against
any
earlier
time
when
it
was--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--well,
first
of
all,
if
we
are
talking--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--well,
if
we
are
talking
about
probable
cause,
obviously
the
standard
is
less
than
reasonable
doubt.
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
under
the
cases
that
the
illinois
appellate
court
relied
on
and
that
i
believe
applied
in
this
situation,
both
u.s.
v.
chadwick
and
arkansas
versus
sanders,
the
doctrine
there
is
that
probable
cause
does
not
excuse
the
warrant
requirement.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
i
suggest
that
that--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--i
do
say
that,
yes.
and
i
say
that
because
that
has
been
an
attack
made
by
the
petitioners,
that
for
some
reason
there
can
be
no
objective
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
package,
in
a
container
once
it
has
gone
through
customs.
apparently
petitioners
feel
that
an
objective
expectation
lies
upon
the
package,
rather
than
on
the
possessor
or
recipient,
and
that
there's
some
sort
of
halo
that
surrounds
a
suitcase
or
container
once
it
goes
through
customs,
that
halo
is
erased
and
forever
more
that
container
can
never
be
an
object
of
privacy
again.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
i
agree
with
that.
i
think--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--well,
justice
o'connor,
once
that
door
closes
to
a
private
fourth
amendment
area...
that
is
why
i
responded
as
i,
did
to
chief
justice
burger--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--well,
let's
assume
that...
you're
making
me
do
things
that
are
not
in
the
case,
and
that
i
find
difficult
because
then
i
would
be
in
a
different
position,
of
course.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
reasonable
assumption,
yes.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
let
us
assume--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--both
at
the
trial
level
and
at
the
appellate
level
and
in
our
briefs
in
this
court,
we
have
specifically
prescinded
from
any
discussion
of
whether
or
not
the
customs
search
was
a
lawful
search
by
a
governmental
agency.
we
have
conceded
for
purposes
of
argument
that
it
was.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
i
think
justice
marshall
raised
one,
whether
or
not--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--i
suggest
that
a
customs
search
must
be
reasonable.
i
think
that
that
at
least
must
be
a
standard.
i
think
that
customs--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--oh,
i
think
great
latitude
is
given--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--but
nonetheless
there
could
be
such
a
thing
as
an
unreasonable
customs
search.
that's
all
i'm
suggesting.
and
i'm
not
suggesting
in
this
court
that
the
search
of
the
table
at
the
o'hare
customs
depot
was
such
an
unreasonable
search.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
once
again
you're
asking
me
to
go
into
hypotheticals.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
but
i
suggest
that
there
may
be
a
rochin
versus
california
situation
at
a
customs
depot
some
day
that
could
be
so
extreme
that
it
would
offend
this
court.
on
the
other
hand,
i
am
aware
that
there
are
far,
far
greater
latitude
given
to
customs
agents
than
in
any
other
search
that
i
know
of.
i
agree
with
the
court
on
that
basis.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
that
is
correct,
that
was
the
evidence
that
was
elicited.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
oh,
it's
quite
possible
that
the--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--or
it
was
there
before
the
customs
search,
correct.
because
customs
found
that
hashish
at
the
airport.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
then
i
agree--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--then
we
are
in
an
extremely
different
case
than
we
are
today.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
yes.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
the
question,
though,
i
believe
is
whether
at
the
time
he
walked
out
of
that
door--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--into
the
hallway
with
a
closed
opaque
container,
that
at
that
point
the
police
agents
who
seized
the
package
had
a
right
to
search
it
under
chadwick,
because
at
that
point,
did
they
have
such
certainty?
first
of
all,
did
they
have
such
close
control
as
the
cases
require
for
them
to
say
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
continuation
of
our
earlier
customs
search
or
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
reassertion
of
immediate
control
versus
surveillance
control.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
i
do
for
the
following
reasons,
because--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--i'm
sorry
if
i
misunderstood
your
hypothetical,
but
i
assumed
that
this
friend
was
continuing
the
surveillance
on
behalf
of
the
police.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
the
question
then
for
this
court
would
be
whether
the
controlled
delivery
cases
of
the
courts
of
appeals
should
be
ratified
in
this
court.
i
don't
think
that
question
has
ever
been
answered
and
i
think
justice
rehnquist
pointed
that
out
in
a
grant
of
stay
to
a
california
case,
that
this
court
has
never
addressed
the
problem
directly.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
your
original
hypothetical
was
to
me
how
long
a
break
in
time
is
necessary,
and
i--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--i
suggest
that
if
that
would
be
the
rationale
upon
which
the
lower
court
or
this
court
should
rule,
then
that
should
have
been
developed
by
the
state
as
a
way
of
showing
that
this
container
had
to
be
in
the
same
condition
that
it
always
was.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
the
question,
however,
is
not
whether
it's
been
in
my
client's
possession,
but
whether
the
contents
of
that
table
are
available
for
search
without
a
warrant.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
but
no
one
at
the
time
that
that
package
was
seized
outside
his
door
at
the
time
of
arrest,
no
one
ever
testified
that
the
contents
of
that
container
were
the
same,
nor
could
they
have,
if
you
examine
the
facts,
because
that
was
an
ordinary
shipping
container.
all
you
had
to
do
was
take
the
top
off
as
the
customs
agent
did,
take
out
the
contents,
put
in
anything
else
you
wanted.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
controlled
delivery
cases
that
i
have
seen
have
required
such
close
surveillance
that
there
could
be
no
change
in
the
contents
of
the
package.
that's
what
u.s.
v.
deberry
said,
that's
what
ford
said.
in
all
of
those
cases--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--that's
what
the
courts
have
searched
for
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
think
it
is
reasonable
because--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
the
standard
as
i
read
it
in
arkansas
versus
sanders.
the
probable
cause
by
itself
does
not
excuse
the
warrant
requirement.
that
is
the
way
i
read
sanders,
and
i
believe
that
is
the
way...
that
is
what
the
illinois
court
relied
on,
that
probable
cause
is
not
a
sufficient
standard
for
excusing
a
law
enforcement
official
from
obtaining
a
warrant,
except
where
there
are
exigent
circumstances,
and
there
were
none
here.
so
that
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
agree
with
that
understanding
of
the--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--well
then,
of
course
we
are
backing
away,
i
believe,
from
the
standard
in
chadwick,
which
was
that
probable
cause
is
insufficient.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
my
response
to
that
would
be
that
if
we
then
wish
to
be
consistent,
if
that
is
the
consistency
that
the
court
wishes,
then
we
should
say
that
under
controlled
delivery
cases
a
warrant
is
required.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
i
can
only
say
that
i
believe
that
is
the
logical
consistency
that
i'm
confronted
with
by
the
decisions
in
this
court,
and
i
suggest
that,
whatever
we
look
to
as
a
standard
in
this
case,
the
facts
of
this
case...
i
think
i
agree
with
counsel--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--i
think
the
fact
that
the
officers
went
to
get
a
warrant
once
that
apartment
door
was
closed
indicates
to
me
that
those
officers,
as
well
as
i,
knew
that
they
had
lost
control
at
that
point
and
that
they
need
a
warrant
at
that
point
to
reassert
control
and
to
research
that
package.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
but
they
didn't
reseize
it
at
that
point.
that's
my
point.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
no,
i
don't
think
i'd
criticize
for
going
and
getting
a
warrant.
that's
what
i'm
arguing
for.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
well,
and
to--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--for
the
purpose
of
seizing
a
container
within
which
was
another
container,
within
which
was
the
object
of
the
warrant.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
i
suggest
that
they
could
stop
the
car
under
case
law
relating
to
cars,
carroll,
et
cetera,
and
the
new
cases
on
that
point.
i
suggest,
however,
that
the
probable
cause
that
they
would
have
even
under
the
most
recent
cases
of
this
court
on
the
searches
of
autos
would
give
them
probable
cause
for
a
package,
rather
than
for
the
generalized
search
of
the
auto,
and
that
since
it
was
a
package
it
would
then
need
a
warrant.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
i
do.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
i
do.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
so
you
concede
the
car
would
be
lawfully
stopped
on
the
belief
that
it
was
probably
transporting
drugs,
but
you
say
they
couldn't
open
the
package
without
a
warrant?
i
suggest
that
even
under
ross
the
package
would
be
the
object
of
the
probable
cause,
rather
than
the
generalized
interior
of
the
vehicle,
and
on
that
basis
ross
would
not
authorize
a
generalized
search
of
the
car
or
opening
of
any
or
all
packages
or
compartments,
but
would
rather
require
a
seizure
of
the
package
and
a
reduction
of
that
package
to
the
immobility
and
total
security
of
the
chadwick
situation
and
an
obtaining
of
a
warrant,
as
in
chadwick
and
as
in
sanders,
which
distinguished
specifically
the
carroll
doctrine
from
this
type
of
container
situation.
i
suggest
that,
like
chadwick,
when
john
andreas
had
a
half
hour
with
that
package
or
more
alone
in
his
home
and
when
he
came
out
that
package
was
seized,
the
same
as
it
was
in
chadwick,
he
stood
in
the
same
relative
position
as
the
defendants
in
chadwick.
and
like
in
chadwick,
that
package
was
taken
to
the
police
station
and
reduced
to
total
police
control
and
security.
the
police
had
no
reason
to
suspect
that
that
package
contained
explosives
or
other
dangerous
articles.
the
police
had
no
exigent
circumstances.
they
opened
it
without
a
warrant.
the
warrant
was
required
under
both
arkansas
versus
sanders
and
under
united
states
versus
chadwick.
and
our
position
is
that
once
agent
labek
left
the
floor
of
that
building,
if
there
were
any
vestige
of
surveillance
going
on,
he
said
he
didn't
even
keep
the
apartment
under
his
personal
surveillance
during
that
half
hour.
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
package
could
have
had
any
problem
being
opened
or
changed
or
whatever.
there
was
no
certainty
at
all
by
that
point.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
thank
you.
in
the
remaining
moments,
i
would
like
once
again,
if
i
may,
to
address
the
question
of
justice
o'connor's
as
to
the
time
lapse,
the
short
time
lapse
after
the
closing
of
the
door.
i
think
perhaps
a
review
of
the
petitioner's
reasoning
that
they
urge
us
to
accept
relating
to
the
expectation
of
privacy
may
help
us
in
this
area,
and
that
is,
the
petitioner
urges
us
that
there
is
no
expectation
of
privacy.
we
have
urged
that
there
is
and
that
the
respondent
at
the
point
that
he
closed
the
door
to
his
apartment
stood
in
the
same
position
relative
to
an
expectation
of
privacy
as
mr.
katz
did
in
katz
versus
united
states
when
he
closed
the
door
to
that
telephone
booth.
the
court
said
in
that
case
that
up
until
the
moment
that
mr.
katz
entered
that
phone
booth
there
was
no
expectation
of
privacy
that
he
could
have
in
that
booth.
but
when
he
went
in,
closed
the
door
and
paid
his
dime,
the
government
could
not
enter,
and
it
was
at
that
moment
that
the
government
could
no
longer
violate
that
expectation
of
privacy.
i
suggest
that
john
andreas
at
the
time
he
took
the
closed
opaque
container
from
the
government
agents
and
rolled
it
into
the
closed
door
of
his
own
apartment,
that
at
that
moment
he
manifested
the
expectation
of
privacy
and
that
it
wouldn't
matter
from
that
moment
on
how
long
we
talk
about
or
whether
there's
a
short
time
gap
or
a
long
time
gap,
because
at
that
moment
the
government
does
not
have
control,
there
is
no
longer
any
exception
that
they
can
claim
to
the
otherwise
always
supreme
warrant
requirement.
and
on
that
basis
i
hope
my
answer
at
least
clarifies
it,
whether
or
not
it
is
acceptable
to
all
members.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
i
think
it's
possible
to
make
an
argument
that
there's
probable
cause
at
that
point
in
fact
for
believing
that
there
may
be
some
contraband
in
that
package,
based
on
earlier
knowledge.
the
illinois
court
said
that
that's
a
possible
argument,
but
it
doesn't
apply
here
because
probable
cause
does
not
excuse
the
warrant
requirement
as
long
as
there
is
no
controlled
delivery
in
this
case.
we
go
back
to
the
standard
of
chadwick
and
sanders,
and
in
this
situation
that
standard
is
that
a
warrant
is
required
absent
exigent
circumstances.
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
not
a
controlled
delivery
case,
the
facts
do
not
demonstrate
it.
and
so
to
begin
to
elaborate
as
to
how
much
control
or
how
little,
this
purely
and
simply
is
not
a
controlled
delivery
case,
and
in
that
setting
the
government
or
the
state
of
illinois
relies
on
an
improper
premise
in
asking
us
to
excuse
the
otherwise
necessary
warrant.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
no.
we
have
alleged
that
there
are
two
reasons
for
the
loss
of
control.
there
is
certainly
the
loss
of
control
at
the
door
of
the
apartment,
but
we
have
alleged
an
earlier
reason.
the
state
never
did
establish
that
on
february
22nd,
when
agent
labek
went
to
the
customs
depot,
that
he
had
any
direct
knowledge
of
what
was
inside
the
package
that
he
told
us
was
closed
and
opaque
at
the
time
he
picked
it
up
on
february
22nd.
so
there
really
is
a
gap
from
february
21st
at
some
point
during
the
day
up
until
the
search
the
following
evening
of
the
22nd
at
the
police
station.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
there's
no
evidence
that
they
told
him
anything.
facts
in
this
case
were
never
brought
forward
by
the
prosecution
at
the
trial
level
to
show
any
communication--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
what
were
they--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--the
customs
agents
told
the
agent
labek
on
the
21st
to
come
out
to
the
airport
and
see
the
package
that
we
opened.
he
then
tells
us
he
did.
he
went
out,
he
looked
at
the
package.
it
was
already
open.
the
table
was
out
of
the
package
and
he
made
a
test
that
confirmed
to
his
satisfaction
contraband
as
part
of
that
shipment.
he
never
repackaged
the
table.
there's
never
any
testimony
by
either
agent
labek
or
agent
grosek
of
customs--
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
--well,
perhaps
they
had
what
you've
already
described
as
probable
cause
to
know
what's
in
that
package.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
cases
relating
to
controlled
delivery
more
is
needed.
we
cannot
just
assume
that
agent
labek
at
the
time
he
takes
the
package
on
the
22nd
has
any
direct
knowledge
of
what's
inside
that
package,
without
evidence
on
that
point.
and
none
was
presented
to
the
court
at
any
time.
mr.
patrick
g.
reardon
oh,
it
did.
it
did.
the
illinois
appellate
court
related
two
specific
areas
where
there
was
a
problem,
and
they
suggested
that
the
main
one
was
at
the
time,
the
30
to
45
minutes.
but
they
also
in
the
opinion
point
to
the
fact
that
at
the
time
of
the
initial
pickup
during
the
early
afternoon
hours
on
the
22nd
agent
labek
received
no
communication
and
therefore
had
no
direct
knowledge.
and
they
were
troubled
by
that
as
well.
that
is,
i
believe,
in
the
opinion.
