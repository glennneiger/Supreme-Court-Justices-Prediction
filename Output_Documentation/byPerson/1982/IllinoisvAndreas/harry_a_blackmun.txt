in
this
case
would
your
analysis
be
any
different
had
it
been
a
small
suitcase?
justice

so
in
this
case
much
depends
on
the
facts,
then.

mr.
reardon,
would
you
want
us
to
draw
a
bright
line
where
there
is
any
period
of
time
whatsoever
when
the
package
is
out
of
eyesight
of
the
authorities?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
at
least
that
would
be
an
easy
approach,
a
bright
line
is
drawn
and
it's
easy
to
be
enforced
that
way.
