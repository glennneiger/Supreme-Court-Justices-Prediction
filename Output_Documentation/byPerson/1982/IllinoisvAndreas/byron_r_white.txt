how
much
did
they
get
out
of
the
table?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much...
what
was
the
weight?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
all
the
same
material?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
openable
in
some
other
way
besides
a
drill?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
may
open
it
up
and
empty
it,
and
then
he
had
to
fill
it
up
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
later.
but
when
it
was
taken...
when
it
was
searched
at
the
police
station
it
certainly
had
something
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
no
indication...
and
if
there
was
something
in
it,
it
was
either
put
in
it
in
his
apartment
or
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
i
return
to
a
question
i
asked
you
a
while
ago.
this
won't
be
a
hypothetical.
i
take
it
there
was
hashish
found
in
the
table
at
the
police
station?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
it
a
fair
inference
from
the
record
that
the
hashish
was
either
placed
in
the
table
in
your
client's
house
or
it
was...
or
what
was
found
in
the
table,
whatever
it
was
might
have
been
taken
out,
was
there
before
it
got
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
possible?
i
mean,
aren't
there
only
two
alternatives
as
to
where
that
hashish
came
from?
it
was
either
added
in
his
house
or
it
was
there
before
it
got
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
it
had
never
been
out
of
anybody's
sight,
and
suppose
a
friend
of
your
client's
who
was...
this
is
a
hypothetical.
suppose
a
friend
of
your
client
went
in
the
house
with
him
and
he
just
happened
to
be
an
informer
for
the
police,
so
it
was
always
under
observation
and
he
testifies
that
nothing
was
taken
out
or
put
in.
and
then
it
was
searched
at
the
police
station.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
would
have
no...
then
you
might
be
in--
justice
byron
r.
white
--all
that
would
then
show
is
that
the
hashish
was
in
there
when
it
was
delivered
to
him
and
it
was
never
taken
out.
that's
all
it
would
show.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
on
the
facts
of
this
case
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
stuck
with
the
unquestionable
fact
that
hashish
was
either
put
there
by
him
in
the
house
or
it
was
there
when
it
was
delivered.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
certainly
then,
you
certainly
want
to
cut
off
a
so-called
controlled
search,
a
controlled
surveillance.
you
just
want
to
put
that
aside
and
say
that
this
expectation
of
privacy
takes
over
as
soon
as
the
door
closes
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
you
then...
why
would
you
say
that
you
would
lose
the
case
if
a
friend
was
there
with
him
and
later
testified
that
they
never
touched
the
table?
because
as
soon
as
the
door
closed
there
was
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
the
police
should
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
he
was,
he
was.
but
nevertheless,
the
door
was
closed,
and
in
his
house
an
expectation
of
privacy
should
cut
off
the
entire
customs
rationale
excuse.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't
the
question
be,
was
there
an
opportunity
for
somebody
else
to
put
in
the
table
what
was
later
found
in
the
table?
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
question
if
there's
going
to
be
a...
if
you're
going
to
examine
a
break,
you
should
examine
it
from
that
standpoint.
they
unquestionably
found
something
later
in
the
table,
and
if
somebody
else
might
have
put
it
there
that's
another
matter.
but
if
you
know
it's
always
been
in
your
client's
possession--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wasn't
empty.
it
wasn't
empty.
it
was
full.
yes,
but
you
don't
find
out
until
you
search
it.
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
certainly
while
the
table
was
in
the
house
there's
no
way
they
could
get
in
the
house
without
a
warrant.
the
warrant
they
went
to
get
was
to
search
the
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
couldn't
enter
the
house,
i
guess,
without
a
warrant.
