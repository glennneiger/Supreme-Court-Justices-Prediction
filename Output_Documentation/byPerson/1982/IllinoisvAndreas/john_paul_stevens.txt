mr.
devine,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
there?
the
question
i
guess
that
justice
rehnquist
focused
on
is
you
said
it
would
have
to
be
at
least
probable
cause.
how
would
you
frame
the
standard
of
the
degree
of
certainty
that
there
hasn't
been
a
changing
in
the
contents
of
the
container?
here
you've
got
30
minutes
to
deal
with
and
that's
the
problem
i
guess
the
appellate
court
had,
the
interval.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
endorse
that
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
their
test,
and
i
guess
you're
willing
to
endorse
it,
is
quite
different
from
merely
a
probable
cause
test.
it's
a
higher
standard,
and
you
say
on
these
facts
you
meet
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
arguing
for
a
probable
cause
standard,
is
what
i'm
really
trying
to
find
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
once
you
have
actual
knowledge,
is
that
all
you
need
at
any
time
after
that,
is
probable
cause
to
believe
there
hasn't
been
a
change
in
the
contents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
theory
on
the
time
interval?
do
you
think
there's
any
relevance
to
the
reason
why
the
police
did
not
apprehend
him
immediately
upon
the
delivery?
as
i
understand
the
facts,
what
they
did
was
they
did
then
take
the
time
to
send
someone
out
to
get
a
warrant
and
then
he
unexpectedly
emerged
from
the
apartment
before
they
could
get
the
warrant.
is
that
relevant
at
all
in
the
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
hadn't
lost
control
at
the
time
they
handed
him
the
package
and
he
said,
it's
not
too
heavy,
i
can
handle
it
myself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
apparently
the
reason
they
didn't
at
that
point
in
time
was
they
decided
that
it
would
be
better
police
procedure
to
get
a
warrant,
and
i
certainly
don't
think
you'd
criticize
them
for
doing
that.
