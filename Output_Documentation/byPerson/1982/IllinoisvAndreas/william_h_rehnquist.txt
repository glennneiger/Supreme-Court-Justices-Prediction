that
would
be
true,
following
up
in
justice
blackmun's
question,
only
so
long
as
there
were
probable
cause
to
believe
that
whatever
had
been
in
the
container
was
still
in
it.
if
it
had
been
in
the
guy's
apartment
for
two
days
and
he
comes
out
with
a
container,
he
may
just
be
throwing
it
in
the
trash.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
analytically
one
might
have
a
controlled
delivery
in
connection
with
some
other
valid
search
that
wasn't
based
on
customs.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
we're
talking
about
is
probable
cause.
we're
not
talking
about,
i
would
think,
the
kind
of
chain
of
possession
that
you
have
for
a
chemist
to
testify
at
a
trial.
this
is
strictly
probable
cause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--your
theory
is
that
it's
perfectly
conceivable
that
he
himself
might
have
taken
it
out
in
his
house,
in
the
apartment,
and
emerged
with
the
thing
just
unchanged,
at
any
rate,
from
the
way
it
had
been
delivered
to
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
almost
a
chain
of
possession
reasoning,
like
you
have
to
have--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
when
you're
talking
about
probable
cause...
i
mean,
the
whole
gist
of
what
you
can
search
in
the
fourth
amendment
area
depends
on
probable
causes.
why
should
a
different
standard
apply
in
this
one
little
nook
of
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
treat
this
as
if
it
were
simply
a
probable
cause
like
they
had
to
search
the
suitcase
in
arkansas
against
sanders.
but
here
you
have
a
customs
search
which
demonstrates
beyond
peradventure
of
a
doubt
that
at
that
point
there's
contraband
in
the
package,
and
so
the
question
is
what
standard
of
knowledge
are
you
going
to
require
to
assume
that
the
package
is
still
in
the
condition
it
was
in
at
customs
some
time
later.
i
don't
see
why
probable
cause
shouldn't
be
that
standard.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainty
wouldn't
have
been
sufficient
in
arkansas
against
sanders.
a
warrant...
certainty
without
a
warrant
would
have
done
the
officers
no
good.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
free
to
argue
that
if
you
want
to.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
didn't
trouble...
the
point
you
make
did
not
trouble
the
illinois
appellate
court,
did
it?
