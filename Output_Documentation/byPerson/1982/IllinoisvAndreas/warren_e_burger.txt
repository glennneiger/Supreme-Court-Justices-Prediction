we'll
hear
argument
next
in
illinois
versus
andreas.
mr.
devine,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
responded
to
one
question
by
saying
that
if
there
had
been
a
lapse
of
two
or
three
days
that
would
make
it
quite
a
different
case.
from
that
is
it
correct
to
assume
that
you
are
saying
that
the
observation
of
the
officers,
plus
the
short
lapse
of
time,
was
sufficient
to
give
them
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
container
was
in
the
same
condition
and
had
the
same
contents
when
it
came
out
of
the
apartment
as
when
it
went
in?
is
that
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
that
case
the
individual
searched
was
still
on
the
premises.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
reardon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
understand...
at
some
point
will
you
give
your
definition
of
what
you
think
a
controlled
delivery
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
i
was
driving
at
is,
when
you
use
the
term
what
do
you
mean
by
it,
not
what
the
courts
meant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
keep
control
over
the
contents?
how
do
you
observe
the
contents
when
they're
sealed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
more
likely
than
not
is
the
standard,
is
it
not,
more
likely
than
not,
as
distinguished
from
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
got
an
impression
that
you've
suggested
that
when
this
man
took
the
container
out
of
the
hall
and
took
it
into
the
apartment,
then
it
achieved
some
new
changed
status
or
cloak
of
privacy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
there
be
any
possible
question
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
raise
a
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
aware
that
they
sometimes
take
a
suitcase
and
take
the
lining
out?
first
they
take
the
contents
out,
then
they
tear
the
lining
out,
and--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--unlimited
latitude.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
with
a
person
they
sometimes
take
the
people
into
a
private
area
and
have
a
physician
or
a
nurse
strip
them
and
examine
them.
now,
is
there
any
question
about
the
right
of
customs
to
check
everything
they
want
to
check?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
they'd
waited
until
he
had
taken
the
package
out,
put
it
in
his
automobile,
and
then
started
off.
given
the
background,
given
the
background,
would
you
say
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
officers
to
believe
that
when
he
was
transporting
that
package
he
was
transporting
an
unlawful
drug,
and
that
therefore
if
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that,
that
they
couldn't
stop
him
without
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
don't
you
read
our
cases
as
having,
recent
cases,
as
having
largely,
very,
very
largely,
expanded
what
can
be
searched
in
the
car
without
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
once
the
car
has
been
lawfully
stopped.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
you
may
continue,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
having
observed
him
putting
some
contraband
drugs
into
the
apartment
in
an
identifiable
package
and
then
30
minutes
later
seeing
him
take
that
same
package
out,
was
there
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
there
might
be
drugs
in
the
package
that
he
carried
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
were
they
following
him
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
were
they
following
him
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
answered
justice
o'connor,
said
the
customs
agents
never
told
him
they
had
contraband
in
the--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--the
question
is,
why
are
they
wasting
the
time
and
the
manpower
to
conduct
surveillance
on
this
fellow?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
