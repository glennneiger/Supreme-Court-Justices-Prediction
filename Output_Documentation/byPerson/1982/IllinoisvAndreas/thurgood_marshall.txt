justice
thurgood
marshall
counsel,
while
you're
interrupted,
you
said
the
keys
were
along
with
the
shipment
papers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
anybody
to
open
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
authority
did
they
have
to
drill
into
my
furniture?
when
you're
bringing
it
in
customs,
they
can
take
it
apart
and
make
a
french
connection
search,
can't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
give
me
any
better,
authoritative
answer
than
a
moving
picture?
justice
thurgood
marshall
customs
just
has
that
broad
authority,
right,
it's
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
is
drilling,
this
is
drilling.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
is,
what
case
or
what
other
authority
do
you
have
to
drill
into
a
piece
of
furniture?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
problem,
if
any,
do
you
have
with
the
fact
that
they
also
had
the
keys?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
customs...
did
the
government
keep
the
keys?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
escape
it
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
of
right
now,
with
what
your
associate
tells
me,
i
have
to
also
assume
that
somebody
drilled
into
my
furniture.
don't
you
have
to
assume
that?
