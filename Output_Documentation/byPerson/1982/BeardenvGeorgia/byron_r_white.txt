do

do
you
know
if
the
obligation,
the
condition
about
restitution
and
paying
a
fine,
did
they
survive
the
revocation
of
probation?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
in
this
particular
case,
if
he
went
to
jail,
was
he
free
from
the
conditions
of
paying
the
fine?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think...
historically
in
the
books
there
were
a
lot
of
provisions
that
prescribed
the
punishment
for
a
certain
criminal
act,
30
days
or
$30.
now,
here
is
a
legislative
judgment.
suppose
a
legislature
said,
if
you
steal
something
that
is
worth
$200,
you
either
pay
a
$100
fine
or
go
to
jail
for
five
days.
those
are
equivalent.
and
we
just
think
that
if
you
can't
pay
the
$100,
you
have
got
to
do
something,
so
we
are
going
to
send
you
to
jail
for
five
days.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
just
shorthand
for
saying
that
you
think
that
the
statute
is
bad.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
legislature
didn't
think
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
ultimate
sentence
to
jail?
first
five
years.
then
he
lowered
it
to
three
with
the
credit.
so
what
was
the
time
he
was
going
to
spend
in
jail?
