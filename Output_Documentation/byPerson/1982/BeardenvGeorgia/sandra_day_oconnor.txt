justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
sentencing
judge,
who
has
options
available
to
him
at
sentencing,
the
possibility
of
a
jail
term,
the
possibility
of
a
fine,
the
possibility
of
probation
on
condition
that
a
fine
is
paid,
can
the
sentencing
judge
decide
that
because
the
person
in
fact
is
unemployed
and
indigent,
and
therefore
unlikely
that
he
could
pay
a
fine,
and
would
be
a
poor
risk
on
probation,
should
be
sentenced
to
jail?
is
that
all
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
defendant
ever
ask
to
have
that
term
of
condition
modified...
term
of
probation
modified
or
extended
or
reduced
or--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--he
had
that
right,
i
suppose,
under
state
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
suggestion
is
that
perhaps
the
judge
should
consider
the
nature
of
the
offense,
and
decide
considering
the
offense
and
the
nature
of
the
defendant
what
punishment
is
appropriate,
whether
it
is
jail,
or
a
fine,
or
in
either
case
how
much
or
how
long
it
should
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
a
judge
who
is
considering
whether
to
continue
someone
on
probation
should
reasonably
consider
whether
the
person
has
a
job,
and
if
not,
the
extent
to
which
he
is
a
risk
to
society,
being
a
convicted
felon
and
not
having
employment?
is
that
appropriate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lohr,
do
you
think
that
the
judge
in
revoking
probation
can
consider
whether
the
defendant
has
made
a
bona
fide
effort
to
be
employed,
and
therefore
earn
the
money
to
pay
the
fine,
in
determining
whether
to
revoke
probation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
not
my
question
to
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
to
be
employed,
and
to
get
out
there
and
hustle
and
earn
the
money
to
pay
the
fine,
and
the
judge
feels
maybe
that
wasn't
done.
is
that
grounds
for
revocation
of
the
probation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
somebody
can
just
sit
around
and
not
make
a
bona
fide
effort
to
get
a
job
and
pay
the
fine
that
has
been
ordered,
that
he
has
agreed
to
pay
when
the
probation
was
originally
imposed.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
a
little
of
that
element
in
this
case,
isn't
there,
where
the
trial
judge
on
revoking
probation
commented
that
jobs
were
available
for
anyone
who
would
come
to
the
courthouse
any
day
during
the
week,
and
that
this
defendant
didn't
do
that,
and
some
indication
here
that
that
is
what
this
judge
thought
that
happened?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
the
defendant
who
is
on
probation
has
some
kind
of
a
liberty
interest
in
remaining
out
of
jail,
does
he
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can
he
have
his
probation
revoked
solely
because
of
circumstances
beyond
his
control?
for
example,
he
is
told
as
a
condition
of
probation
not
to
leave
the
state,
and
he
is
kidnapped,
and
is
taken
forcibly
across
the
border.
can
probation
be
revoked
for
that
reason?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
all
right.
he
loses
his
job,
and
it
is
no
fault
of
his
own.
he
was
hired
as
a
replacement
strike
worker--
0
[generallaughter.]
--as
a
permanent
employee
and
then
fired.
now,
can
he
be...
can
probation
be
revoked
because
of
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
what
saves
it
here,
where
he
says,
i
lost
my
job,
and
i
have
been
trying
to
get
work,
and
i
can't,
so
i
can't
pay
the
fine.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
a
due
process
kind
of
a
concern
rather
than
equal
protection?
are
we
concerned
with
fundamental
fairness
here
in
talking
about
arbitrariness
of
the
decision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
not
altogether
clear,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
not
altogether
clear
what
the
basis
of
some
of
these
prior
decisions--
