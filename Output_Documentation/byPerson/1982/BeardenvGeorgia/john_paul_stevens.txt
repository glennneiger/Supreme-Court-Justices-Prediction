doesn't
the
record
also
show
the
amount
of
the
restitution,
the
$200
on
one
charge
and
$50
on
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
isn't
it
fair
to
assume
that's
the
amount
he
had
to
restore?
i
mean,
that
must
be
the
value
of
what
he
stole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.

counsel,
wouldn't
your
client
be
better
off
if
georgia
law
permitted
him
to
make
a
showing
of
a
bona
fide
effort
to
raise
funds
as
a
defense
to
the
probation?
as
i
understand
it
now,
even
with
the
bona
fide
effort,
even
if
the
facts
were
1,000
percent
favorable,
a
total
impossibility,
he
can
still
be
sentenced
to
jail
for,
what
is
it,
five
years
in
this
case,
because
he
couldn't
raise
$500.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
sentence,
if
i
remember
the
record
correctly,
it
was
imposed
not
by
the
original
sentencing
judge,
but
by
the
judge
at
the
time
of
the
revocation.
the
original
sentencing
judge
only
sentenced
him
to
one
year,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
five
years
was
at
the
time
of
the
revocation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
would
that
be
permissible
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
if,
say,
his
probation
period
lasted
for
three
years,
and
he
paid
the
$550
within
the
deadline,
he
used
his
last
dime
to
pay
the
$550,
and
periodically
his
condition
is
reviewed,
and
the
judge
finds
out
he
is
totally
broke,
he
has
no
money
at
all,
he
is
indigent.
could
he
then
say,
well,
i
think
i
am
going
to
revoke
your
probation
because
i
don't
think
you
are
a
good
risk
any
more?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
one
of
the
conditions
is
that
he
must
appear
to
the
judge
periodically
to
be
a
good
probation
risk?
say
the
state
statute
permitted
a
re-examination
from
time
to
time
of
the
condition
of
the
probationer.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
one
of
the
conditions
is,
he
satisfy
the
judge
that
he
is
still
not
a
risk
to
society
and
that
he
is
just
generally
still
a
good
risk,
and
you
leave
that
to
the
wide
discretion
of
the
sentencing
judge,
who
always
has
very
wide
discretion
in
these
matters.
why
couldn't
you
let
the
judge
just
re-examine
it
every
six
months,
and
he
just
decides,
well,
i
am
not
sure
about
you
any
more,
you
don't
have
any
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
my
question.
is
it
a
valid
condition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
i
think
your
argument
is
that
indigency
is
related
to
probation
worthiness.
i
think
that's
what
your
argument
comes
down
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
related
to
his
probation
worthiness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
is
true,
i
would
not
see
any
constitutional
objection
to
a
statute
such
as
i
hypothesize.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that
is
what
the
issue
in
the
case
is.
