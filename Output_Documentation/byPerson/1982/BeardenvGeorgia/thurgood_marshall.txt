justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
he
didn't
even
have
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
the
record
show
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
record
shows
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
assuming
i
may
ask
a
question,
does
the
record
show
specifically
the
places
he
went
to
looking
for
work,
and
name
the
places,
and
that
he
also
went
to
the
state
labor
department?
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
forget
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
that
a
person
who
is
poor
is
a
bigger
risk
than
a
person
who
has
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
just
said
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
trial
court
could
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
to
the
likelihood
that
they
would
commit
a
crime,
is
what
you
were
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
a
poor
person
is
more
likely
to
commit
a
crime
than
a
person
with
money?
and
you
are
speaking
as
a
state
attorney
general?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
original
case
comes
up,
and
the
judge
says,
there
are
two
people
involved
here.
one
has
$500,
and
a
job
that
pays
$10,000
a
year,
and
the
other
one
is
broke,
so
i
find
one
guilty
and
i
release
the
other
one.
he
couldn't
do
that,
could
he?
could
he?
