justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
is
also
true,
isn't
it,
that
your
client
signed
the
order
of
probation
in
which
in
effect
he
agreed
that
in
violation
of
the
terms
of
probation
the
court
may
enter
an
adjudication
of
guilt
and
proceed
as
provided
by
law?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
both
counsel
and
petitioner
signed
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
wouldn't
that
depend
a
good
deal
on
the
crime
committed?
you
have
an
individual
that
plead
guilty
to
burglary.
i
can
think
of
all
sorts
of
crimes
that
would
not
suggest
that
the
individual
would
be
a
very
good
risk.
so
if
you
have
no
alternative
but
to
him
on
work
relief
or
doing
public
service,
would
that
not
be
a
bit
dangerous
for
the
public
generally?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
surely.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
lohr,
do
you
have
any
criticism
of
the
georgia
statute,
or
merely
of
the
way
it
was
applied
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
statute
is
very
generous
on
its
face,
isn't
it?
