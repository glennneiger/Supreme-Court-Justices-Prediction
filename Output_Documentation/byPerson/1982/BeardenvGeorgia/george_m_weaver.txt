mr.
george
m.
weaver
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
raises
an
equal
protection
challenge
to
the
revocation
of
his
probation.
at
stake
is
the
broad
sentencing
discretion
that
this
court
has
often
recognized
to
be
vested
in
trial
courts.
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
the
equal
protection
issue
here
is
not
the
typical
equal
protection
question
this
court
faces.
most
equal
protection
issues
involve
broad,
sweeping
legislative
action
that
is
at
least
to
some
degree
over-inclusive.
here
we
have
a
single
sentencing
decision
by
a
single
trial
court,
highly
individualized,
a
revocation
of
probation
which
was
an
act
of
discretion
by
a
trial
court.
that
is
one
reason
why
the
respondent
submits
that
the
court
should
employ
the
reasonable
basis
test
of
equal
protection
review.
another
is
that
the
conditions
this
court
has
specified
in
the
past
to
the
application
of
higher
scrutiny
are
simply
not
met
in
this
case.
strict
scrutiny,
we
feel,
would
be
inappropriate
because
there
is
no
suspect
criterion
that
is
the
basis
for
the
state
action
here.
moreover,
no
fundamental
right
is
burdened
for
equal
protection
purposes.
a
person
on
probation
has
no
right,
fundamental
or
otherwise,
to
probation.
moreover,
his
fundamental
rights
may
even
be
limited
by
his
probationary
status.
as
to
intermediate
review,
this
court
has
reserved
that
level
for
the
review
of
state
classifications
which
are
based
on
what
some
have
called
semi-suspect
criteria,
usually
immutable
characteristics,
as
gender
or
illegitimacy,
but
in
this
case
there
is
no
such
characteristic
that
is
the
basis
for
the
state
action.
another
reason
why
the
respondent--
mr.
george
m.
weaver
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
he
has
a
conditional
liberty
interest,
and
that
liberty
can
only
be
taken
away
if
the
requirements
of
the
due
process
clause
are
met.
this
court
established
what
those
are
for
probation
revocation
in
the
case
of
gagnon
versus
scarpelli.
in
this
case,
the
requirements
of
the
due
process
clause
were
clearly
met.
there
has
been
no
contention,
as
i
understand
it,
from
the
petitioner.
mr.
george
m.
weaver
i
would
say
no,
in
that
situation.
mr.
george
m.
weaver
well,
your
honor,
in
your
hypothetical,
i
would
say
the
revocation
in
those
circumstances
would
be
arbitrary,
and
therefore
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
george
m.
weaver
justice
o'connor,
i
think
the
trial
court
could
rationally
have
concluded
that
the
petitioner's
loss
of
his
job
and
his
failure
to
pay
the
fine,
his
inability
to
pay
the
fine
from
the
record
increased
or
made
him
a
less
acceptable
probation
risk.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
follows
from
the
ability
of
a
trial
court
to
consider
financial
resources
and
employment
situation
in
the
original
sentencing
decision.
mr.
george
m.
weaver
no,
sir.
i
am
saying
that
a
person--
mr.
george
m.
weaver
--well,
i
think
a
trial
court
could
reasonably
use--
mr.
george
m.
weaver
--a
trial
court
could
reasonably
use
a
person's
financial
resources
and
their
employment
history
as
an
index
to
their
likely
probation
success.
mr.
george
m.
weaver
likelihood
that
they
would
commit
a
crime
and
probation
success.
mr.
george
m.
weaver
your
honor,
i
am
saying
it
is
reasonable
to
use...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
when
a
trial
court
is
faced
with
sentencing
a
defendant,
in
this
case
deciding
whether
to
put
a
defendant
on
probation
or
not,
the
trial
court
must
make
a
prediction.
under
georgia
law,
he
must
decide
under
the
statute
whether
it
is
likely
that
the
defendant
will
again
engage
in
a
course
of
criminal
conduct.
now,
what
is
to
help
him
make
that
prediction?
i
am
saying
that
the
financial
resources
available
to
the
defendant
and
his
employment
history
are
two
indices.
they
are
imperfect,
your
honor.
i
admit
that.
but
they
can
rationally,
reasonably
be
used
to
predict
the
future
behavior
of
the
defendant.
that
is
the
whole
reason
why
they
are
considered
in
the
first
place.
now,
that
is
the
primary
position
of
the
respondent,
that
financial
resources
and
employment
background
are
a
reasonable
indication
of
likely
probation
success
of
a
defendant.
let
me
illustrate
my
argument
by
making
a
comparison
to
two
other
cases
decided
by
this
court.
in
vance
versus
bradley
and
massachusetts
board
of
retirement
versus
mergia,
the
court
considered
mandatory
retirement
schemes.
the
court
held
that
the
mandatory
retirement
schemes
were
reasonable
and
therefore
not
unconstitutional.
this
court
said
that,
even
though
there
were
employees
under
both
of
those
schemes
who
could
still
perform
the
tasks.
in
other
words,
it
was
reasonable
for
the
congress
in
one
case
and
the
massachusetts
legislature
in
the
other
to
use
age
as
an
index
to
the
physical
capabilities
of
workers,
even
though
there
are
exceptions.
similarly,
in
the
case
before
the
court,
the
respondent
submits
that
it
is
reasonable
for
a
trial
court
to
use
financial
condition
and
employment
history
as
an
index
to
the
likely
probation
success
of
the
defendant.
that
is
the
whole
purpose
for
considering
those
elements,
not
only
on
revocation,
but
also
in
the
original
sentencing
decision.
the
respondent
also
contends
to
the
court
that--
mr.
george
m.
weaver
--no,
sir.
there
would
have
to
be
the
violation
of
a
condition
of
probation.
and
i
think
the
violation
should
have
some--
mr.
george
m.
weaver
--if
he
violated
a
condition
of
probation,
and
the
trial
court--
mr.
george
m.
weaver
--your
honor,
if
that
is
a
valid
condition
of
probation,
i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
george
m.
weaver
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is.
i
think
that
conditions
should
be
sufficiently
specific
so
that
it
can
be
understood,
and
it
has
some
connection
with
the
probation
worthiness,
to
put
it
in
the
best
way
i
can.
mr.
george
m.
weaver
i
am
saying
that
a
person's
financial
resources--
mr.
george
m.
weaver
--yes,
sir.
mr.
george
m.
weaver
if
that
kind
of
condition
would
be
legitimate,
then
i
think
probation
probably
could
be
revoked.
mr.
george
m.
weaver
yes,
sir.
now--
mr.
george
m.
weaver
--i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
think
a
trial
court
can
consider
the
financial
condition
of
the
defendant
in
sentencing
him,
but
if
there
is
that
kind
of
wide
disparity,
i
think
you
might
even
have
an
eighth
amendment
problem,
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
situation,
where
you
have
that
kind
of
disproportionality
between
sentences
for
people
who
have
committed
the
same
crime.
mr.
george
m.
weaver
yes,
sir.
i
think
a
trial
court
could
reasonably
come
to
those
conclusions.
now,
let
me
make
it
clear.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
conclusion
that
this
defendant
was
a
greater
probation
risk
is
the
only
conclusion
the
trial
court
could
have
come
to,
but
under
the
rationality
standard,
it
is
not
required
that
there
be
no
reasons
to
the
contrary.
the
key
words
that
this
court
has
used
to
describe
state
actions
which
fail
to
comply
with
the
rationality
standard
are
"arbitrary"
and
"irrational".
and
the
respondent
submits
that
in
this--
mr.
george
m.
weaver
--well,
the
due
process
clause
is
broad
enough,
i
think,
to
include
this
issue,
but
as
i
understand
the
prior
decisions
of
the
court,
the
equal
protection
clause
has
been
used
to
decide
whether
state
action
is
arbitrary
or
irrational.
in
the
line
of
cases--
mr.
george
m.
weaver
--your
honor?
mr.
george
m.
weaver
no,
sir.
no,
your
honor.

[generallaughter.]
in
the
case
of...
pardon
me.
in
the
case
of
ross
versus
moffitt,
this
court
summarized
some
previous
decisions
of
the
court
that
dealt
with
state
actions
which
had
erected
insurmountable
barriers
to
indigents
seeking
a
review
of
their
criminal
convictions,
and
in
ross
versus
moffitt,
which
justice
rehnquist
wrote,
the
court
said
that
although
those
prior
cases
could
be
fit...
they
could
be
fitted
under
either
the
due
process
or
the
equal
protection
clause,
that
the
court
considered
them
to
be
best
explained
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
this
issue.
my
opponent
has
mentioned
williams
versus
illinois
and
tate
versus
short.
in
those
cases,
this
court
decided
that
the
additional
punishment
imposed
upon
indigents
solely
because
of
their
indigency
served
no
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
george
m.
weaver
well,
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
would
say.
the
court
pointed
out
that
when
the
two
defendants
in
those
cases
were
sentenced,
there
was
a
declaration
by
the
state
that
the
state's
penal
interests
did
not
require
the
additional
punishment
later
imposed
upon
the
indigents.
now,
in
the
case
before
the
court,
i
submit
that
there
is
no...
even
assuming
that
analysis,
there
is
no
declaration
by
the
state
that
the
state's
penal
interest
is
satisfied
here
without
imprisonment.
you
have
to
remember,
this
is
a
probation
case.
tate
versus
short
and
williams
versus
illinois
were
not
probation
cases.
this
defendant,
this
petitioner
was
put
on
probation,
which
is
a
conditional
release,
and
he
has
to
comply
with
certain
conditions
of
probation.
so,
it
is
a
tentative
release.
moreover,
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
put
under
the
first
offenders
act
of
georgia.
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
said
in
a
case
called
state
versus
wiley,
which
is
at
233
georgia
316,
that
the
purposes
of
first
offender's
probation
are
not
the
same
as
ordinary
probation.
the
court
has
said
that
unlike
other
probated
sentences,
the
defendant
is
not
merely
serving
his
sentence
outside
the
confines
of
prison,
but
is
serving
a
period
on
probation
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
prisoner
may
be
rehabilitated.
so,
first
offender's
probation
in
georgia
is
even
more
tentative
than
ordinary
probation.
so
i
submit
we
don't
have
a
declaration
here
as
in
tate
and
williams
that
the
state's
penal
interest
was
satisfied
without
imprisonment.
now,
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
revocation
in
this
case
can
rationally
be
argued
to
help
maintain
public
confidence
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
surely,
public
confidence
would
seriously
be
eroded
if
a
person
like
the
petitioner
could
not
only
escape
imprisonment,
but
even
escape
a
conviction
without
having
kept
the
conditions
of
his
sentence.
and
this
concern
is
especially
great
here,
because
the
petitioner
was
sentenced
under
the
first
offenders
act
of
georgia.
not
only
will
he
escape
imprisonment,
but
also
a
conviction.
respondent
submits
that
to
maintain
public
respect
for
the
administration
of
justice,
this
revocation,
this
state
action
here
can
rationally
be
seen
as
furthering
that
interest.
in
summary,
your
honor,
what
we
have
here
is
a
trial
court
faced
with
a
difficult
sentencing
decision.
the
trial
court
was
faced
with
a
defendant
who
had
plead
guilty
to
burglary
and
theft
by
receiving
charges.
he
has
no
prior
felony
convictions.
he
says
that
he
can
pay
a
small
fine
and
restitution,
and
he
appears
to
be
employed.
based
on
those
premises,
the
trial
court
places
him
on
probation,
gives
him
a
very
lenient
sentence,
and
even
gives
him
the
benefit
of
the
first
offenders
act.
eight
months
later,
the
petitioner
comes
back
in
for
revocation
of
his
probation.
he
has
failed
to
keep
the
conditions.
he
has
not
paid
his
fine
and
restitution,
and
is
now
unemployed.
now,
a
lot
of
questions
could
be
asked
about
the
trial
court's
decision
to
revoke
probation.
it
could
be
asked
whether
it
is
wise,
enlightened,
progressive,
humane,
but
those
are
not
the
issues.
the
issue
is,
was
the
decision
arbitrary,
was
it
irrational?
the
respondent
submits
that
whatever
might
be
said
about
the
decision
of
the
trial
court,
it
was
clearly
rational.
therefore,
it
meets
the
dictates
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
the
judgment
of
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
