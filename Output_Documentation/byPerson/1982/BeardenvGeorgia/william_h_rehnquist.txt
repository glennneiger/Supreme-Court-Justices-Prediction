justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
trial
judge,
i
take
it,
thought
that
what
you
referred
to
as
perhaps
inartfully,
at
least
in
my
opinion,
less
intrusive
methods
might
be
used
to
achieve
society's
goal
without
having
to
send
him
to
jail
at
that
stage.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
were
the
conditions
that
were
imposed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
fine
and
restitution
were
the
two
non-boilerplate
conditions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
the
time
restitution
was
requested
of
him,
did
he
make
any
showing
or
statement
to
the
judge
that
he
was
indigent
and
therefore
couldn't
make
restitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we
have
to
presume
that
everything
that
was
done
to
support
the
constitutionality
of
the
order
below
was
done,
since
we
don't
know?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
did
he
steal,
or
what
was
the
theft?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
any
finding
of
the
value
of
the
items?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
indication
of
what
he
did
with
those
items?
i
mean,
at
one
point
i
presume
he
could
have
made
restitution
if
he
had
simply
still
had
the
property
by
just
giving
the
property
back.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
argument
really
then
is
quite
abstract,
isn't
it,
and
quite
apart
from
the
particulars
of
this
case,
where
your
client
was
convicted
of
theft,
presumably
at
one
time
had
the
ability
to
make
restitution,
accepted
a
sentence
imposing
restitution,
and
now
simply
wants
to
shed
the
whole
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
you
don't
know,
if
the
record
is
silent,
isn't
there
a
presumption
in
a
case
such
as
this
that
the
findings
are
in
support
of
constitutionality?
doesn't
the
record
show
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
only
way
he
paid
the
original
$200
was
to
pay
it
from
his
mother?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
some
table
from
which
the
trial
court
could
have
found
an
equivalent
term?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that...
the
intimation
seemed
to
be
that
the
trial
judge
should
have
made
the
effort.
i
agree
with
you.
i
think
it
would
be
quite
difficult.
then
why
do
you
argue
that
he
should
have
made
the
effort?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
can
sit
around
and
not
only
not
pay
the
fine,
but
not
make
restitution
of
the
value
of
the
property
that
he
has
stolen.
mr.
lohr,
in
this
case--
--would
you
please
answer
my
question?
i
am
helping
him.
0
[generallaughter.]
go
ahead,
answer
the
question,
counsel.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
can
sit
around
and
not
only
not
pay
the
fine,
but
not
make
restitution
of
the
value
of
the
property
that
he
has
stolen.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
some
of
the
consideration
you
are
talking
about
depend
on
the
crime
with
which
the
person
was
charged?
i
mean,
a
trial
judge
could
reasonably
suppose,
i
suppose,
that
a
person
who
was
indigent
would
be
more
likely
to
commit
petty
theft
than
someone
who
had
$100,000
in
the
bank,
but
i
suppose
he
could
also
suppose
that
the
one
with
the
$100,000
in
the
bank
might
be
more
likely
to
kite
a
large
check
than
the
person
who
was
indigent.
both
of
them
are
crimes.
