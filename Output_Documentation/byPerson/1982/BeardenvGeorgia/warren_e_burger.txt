we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
bearden
against
georgia.
mr.
lohr,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
considered
that
one
of
the
consequences,
if
you
prevail,
is
that
judges
in
the
courts
dealing
with
these...
matters
of
this
kind
are
going
to
have
a
tendency,
or
at
least
they
are
going
to
be
encouraged
to
simply
impose...
have
several
alternatives:
impose
a
fine,
saying,
if
you
pay
this
fine
in
cash
or
post
a
bond
within
48
hours,
then
the
sentence
will
be
suspended;
otherwise,
imprisonment...
that
that
may
be
the
tendency,
or
the
judges
will,
as
a
second
alternative,
simply
forget
about
restitution
and
all,
which
is
beginning
to
be
rather
illusory,
and
simply
convict
and
send
all
these
people
to
prison?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
may
be
able
to
get
somebody
to
put
up
a
bond,
if
they
can't
lend
him
the
money,
to
put
up
a
bond
to
see
that
it
is
paid.
here
there
was
no
security
for
the
balance
of
this
fine,
was
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
was
just
a
promise
to
pay.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has
been
said
in
probably
half
a
dozen
cases,
at
least,
that
this
trend
will
probably
lead
to
that
kind
of
a
result.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
weaver?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
lohr?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
