mr.
james
h.
lohr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
revocation
of
an
indigent's
probation
for
his
failure
to
pay
a
fine
and
restitution
which
was
imposed
as
a
condition
of
his
probation.
mr.
bearden
has
received
a
three-year
probated
sentence.
the
condition
was
that
he
pay
$750
as
fine
and
restitution.
two
hundred
dollars
had
to
be
paid
almost
immediately.
this
was
paid
by
his
parents.
within
the
next
four
months,
he
had
to
come
up
with
and
pay
the
balance,
which
is
$550.
approximately
one
month
after
this
sentence
was
imposed,
he
was
laid
off.
he
became
unemployed.
from
that
period
until
the
time
of
the
revocation
hearing,
he
did
not
gain
employment,
although
the
record
shows
that
he
tried
to
gain
employment.
he
was
without
funds.
he
was
without
property.
i
think
he
was
what
we
might
call
functionally
indigent.
the
trial
court
held
the
revocation
hearing
and
revoked
it
on
two
grounds,
as
i
understand
what
the
trial
court
did.
it
revoked
it
on
his
failure
to
pay
the
fine
and
restitution.
secondly,
it
revoked
it
on
his
failure
to
report
to
his
probation
officer
regularly.
that,
of
course,
was
not
a
ground
stated
in
the
petition
to
revoke.
in
fact,
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
evidence
to
support
that
finding,
and
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
held
that
even
if
the
trial
court
did
rely
upon
the
failure
to
revoke
the
probation...
or
revoke
the
probation
for
his
failure
to
report,
that
the
revocation
rested
upon
an
alternate
independent
ground
which
was
sufficient,
and
that
was
that
he
failed
to
pay
his
fine
and
restitution,
which
was
a
condition
of
his
probation.
the
georgia
supreme
court
denied
a
petition
to
review
this
discretionary
appeal,
and
there
are
two
other
important
factors
i
should
mention
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
petitioner
was
serving
his
probation
under
what
we
call
the
georgia
first
offenders
act.
under
that
act,
when
a
person
is
convicted
or
enters
a
plea
of
guilty,
the
court
suspends
further
proceedings
and
places
him
on
probation.
if
he
successfully
completes
his
term
of
probation,
he
is
discharged
without
an
adjudication
of
guilt,
no
criminal
record,
no
criminal
purpose.
on
the
other
hand,
if
his
probation
is
revoked,
the
trial
court
then
at
the
revocation
hearing
enter
an
adjudication
of
guilt
and
sentence
the
defendant
to
any
sentence
that
it
could
have
originally
imposed.
in
this
case,
it
would
have
been
20
years
for
the
burglary
and
ten
years
for
the
theft
by
receiving.
the
only
condition
is
that
he
must
be
given
credit
for
the
time
that
he
was
on
probation.
now,
in
this
case,
when
the
trial
court
originally
revoked
his
probation,
it
sentenced
him
to
five
years
to
serve.
it
was
a
three-year
term
of
probation.
it
sentenced
him
to
five
years
to
serve.
on
a
motion
on
behalf
of
the
defendant,
this
was
reduced
to
the
remaining
balance
of
his
probation,
in
line
with
the
georgia
case
of
stevens
versus
state.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
in
lieu
of
a
fine?
mr.
james
h.
lohr
i
think,
if
i
might
answer
that
question,
if
a
high
level
of
scrutiny
is
to
be
applied
to
this
type
of
state
action,
i
don't
think
it
is
okay.
if
a
low
level
is,
then
i
think
it
is.
if
i
might
explain,
as
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
the
person
could
have
been
placed
on
probation
except
for
the
fact
that
he
couldn't
pay
the
fine.
that
indicates
to
me
that
there
is
no
additional
threat
to
society.
there
is
nothing
being
achieved
by
protecting
society
simply
because
he
was
poor.
as
far
as
rehabilitation
goes,
i
don't
think
the
state
is
achieving
anything
by
putting
him
in
jail
for
rehabilitation
under
these
circumstances.
now,
there
is
the
element
of
deterrence,
let's
say,
to
other
individuals.
for
example,
other
indigents
may
see
this
indigent...
in
their
mind
he
may
be
getting
off
scot
free.
in
other
words,
he
is
not...
doesn't
have
to
pay
a
fine
because
he
is
too
poor,
and
he
doesn't
have
to
go
to
jail.
there
are
other
ways
that
the
state
can
enforce
or
achieve
the
policy
of
deterrence
other
than
the
payment
of
a
fine
or
jail.
those
aren't
the
only
two
options.
so,
if
we
look
at
strict
scrutiny,
so
to
speak,
it
is
not
necessary
to
put
him
in
jail.
there
are
other
less
intrusive
ways
to
accomplish
that
deterrence.
if
we
are
looking
at
just
a
rational
basis,
then
i
think
the
judge
can
do
it,
so
long
as
the
fine
is...
or
the
jail
term
is
in
some
way
commensurate
with
the
fine.
now,
the
second
point
i
just
want
to
mention,
that
i
am
sure
you
are
aware
of,
that
the
fact
that
his
probation
was
revoked
because
he
was
too
poor
to
pay
the
fine
resulted
in
the
adjudication
of
guilt
which
has
several
other
consequences,
among
which
he
loses
his
right
to
vote,
he
loses
his
right
to
hold
public
office,
and
certain
other
rights
that
citizens
who
are
not
convicted
of
a
felony
of
moral
turpitude
hold.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
consider
the
cases
of
williams
versus
illinois
and
tate
versus
short.
this
court
in
the
case
of
williams
versus
illinois
held
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
incarcerate
the
defendant
beyond
the
limits
of
incarceration
which
by
statute
apparently
the
state
determined
as
necessary
to
achieve
the
penalogical
interests
of
the
state.
now,
in
this
present
case,
apparently
the
trial
judge
made
a
determination
that
this
individual
did
not
need
to
go
to
jail
in
order
to
satisfy
the
penalogical
interests
of
the
state.
it
wasn't
a
legislative
determination.
it
was
apparently
done
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
that's
correct.
the
probation
and
the
other...
and
the
conditions
that
were
imposed
upon
his
probation
would
satisfy
the
penalogical
interests
of
the
state.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
they
were
the
standard...
in
addition
to
the
fine
and
restitution,
they
were
the
standard
conditions,
not
to
associate
with--
mr.
james
h.
lohr
--that's
correct.
those
were
the
only
two
non-boilerplate
conditions.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
no,
he
never
made
that
request.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
yes,
the
trial
judge
retains
the
jurisdiction
over
probation
cases
beyond
that
term
of
court
for
the
term
of
probation,
and
i
think
at
any
time
the
trial
court
could
upon
a
reasonable
showing
modify
the
conditions
of
probation.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
i
have
not--
mr.
james
h.
lohr
--i
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
cases
right
on
point
on
this--
mr.
james
h.
lohr
--i
don't
believe
he
is.
i
believe
he
is
going
to
be
obligated
to
pay
the
fine
and
restitution
until,
even
after
the
jail
term,
you
know,
until
he
pays
it.
it
probably
will
never
be
collected,
in
fact.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
at...
we
are
at
a
disadvantage
here.
apparently
there
was
no
transcript
taken
at
the
time
the
plea
was
entered
and
he
was
placed
on
probation.
we
have
searched
for
it,
and
we
can't
find
it.
i
was
not
present
at
that
time.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
well,
the
only
thing
we
have
in
the
record
is
that
in
his
testimony
on
his
probation
revocation
hearing,
he
did
testify
that
he
agreed
to
pay
the
fine
at
the
time
the
condition
of
probation
was
entered,
and
i
am
assuming
that
he
agreed
to
it.
he
had
a
job
at
that
time,
and
felt
like
he
could
pay
it.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
the
burglary,
and
i
think
the
theft
by
receipt,
were
one
and
the...
arose
out
of
the
same
incident,
but
it
was
breaking
into
a
mobile
home
and
apparently
taking
some
items
out
of
the
mobile
home.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
again,
i
really
don't
know.
there
is
no
record
of
what
happened
back
when
he
was
placed
on
probation.
so
i
don't
know
what--
mr.
james
h.
lohr
--all
i
can...
all
i
can
represent
to
this
court
is
what
the
district
attorney
has
led
me
to
believe
in
talking
to
him,
the
one
that
was
apparently
there
at
the
time.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
well,
we
are
assuming
some
things
here,
and
i
don't
know
that
in
fact
he
had
the
ability
to
make
restitution
out
of
the
goods
that
were
stolen.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
that's
true.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
at
the
time--
mr.
james
h.
lohr
--yes,
it
does.
he
either
borrowed
it
or
his
mother
gave
it
to
him
to
pay.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
that's
correct.
and
he
had
a
job
at
the
time,
and
about
a
month
later
became
laid
off.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
that
was
the
restitution.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
it
would
seem
reasonable
to
assume
that,
yes.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
yes,
he
signed
that.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
yes,
both
counsel
that
represented
him
at
that
time.
that's
correct.
in
the
case
of
tate
against
short,
again,
this
court,
in
citing
from
a
concurring
opinion
in
morris
versus
schoonfield,
stated
that
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
fine
is
accompanied
by
a
jail
term
or
not,
and
again,
in
this
case,
it
was
not...
it
was
not
accompanied
by
a
jail
term,
but
only
by
a
probationary
period
of
time.
if
a
jail
term
of
an
indigent
extends
beyond...
excuse
me.
or
whether
or
not
the
jail
term
extends
beyond
the
statutory
maximum.
and
of
course
it
didn't
in
this
case.
it
still
held
there
that
it
is
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
in
order
just
to
convert
a
jail
term...
or,
excuse
me,
a
fine
into
a
jail
term.
and
it
appears
that
that
is
what
we...
what
happened
here,
and
it
wasn't
any
attempt
by
the
trial
court
to
substitute
a
jail
term
equivalent
to
the
$550
he
owed.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
that
poses
a
real
difficult
problem
with
that...
with
that
approach,
simply
because
how
do
you
know
how
much
one
day
is
worth?
mr.
james
h.
lohr
the
only
reason
i
guess
i
made
that
point
is,
it
has
been
suggested...
i
believe
it
was
in
justice
white's
opinion
in
wood
against
georgia
that
there
should
be
some...
when
a
person's
probation
is
revoked
for
his
failure
to
pay
a
fine,
that
there
should
be
some
relationship
between
the
amount
of
jail
time
and
the
amount
of
the
fine,
and
i
guess
the
reason
for
that
is
is
that
apparently
the
state
needs
some...
needs
to
satisfy
its
interest
in
deterrence,
satisfy
its
interest
in
retribution.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
well,
i
think
the
judge
has
wide
discretion
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
at
the
time
he
places
a
person
on
probation
or
puts
him
in
jail
or
imposes
a
fine.
i
think
he
has
wide
discretion.
i
think
he
needs
to
maintain
that.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
i
don't
think
it's
appropriate
to
consider
that
a
person
who
does
not
have
a
job
becomes
a
greater
risk
to
society
than
a
person
under
the
exact
same
circumstances
that
does
have
a
job,
or
a
person
that
is
poor
is
a
greater
risk
to
society
than
an
individual
who
is
rich
under
the
exact
same
circumstances.
so,
if
we
are
looking
at
the
trial
judge's
ability
just
to
look
at
whether
or
not
the
person
is
rich
or
poor,
i
don't
think
they
should
consider
that
in
making
that
initial
determination.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
again,
i
am
going
to
have
to
answer
that,
if
you
apply
the
strict
scrutiny
approach,
i
think
there
are
other
ways
that
the
state
can
accomplish
its
interests.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
that's
correct.
but
you
see,
there
would
be
other
ways
then
that
the
state
could
accomplish
its
same
deterrent
interest.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
person
is
unable
to
pay...
now,
for
a
person
that
could
pay,
it
may
be
a
legitimate
choice,
but
for
a
person
that
is
unable
to
pay,
he
really
has
no
choice
at
all.
it
is
just,
go
to
jail,
for
him.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
should
be
some
other
type
of
provision
made,
that
the
state
could,
with
some
sort
of
a
work
release
program,
have
him
do
public
service
work.
there
are
all
sorts
of
options
open
to
the
state.
and
just
because
it
is
not
paid
immediately
does
not
mean
that
it
may
not
be
paid
down
the
road.
so,
for
a
person
who
is
indigent,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
valid
option.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
well,
i
think
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
a
person
is
a
risk
to
society,
is
going
to
pose
a
threat
to
the
other
individuals
around
him,
needs
to
be
made
independently
of
whether
or
not
this
person
is
rich
or
poor.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
now,
i
agree
that
in
a
case
of
burglary,
it
would
seem...
if
you
compared
it
to
a
traffic
violation--
mr.
james
h.
lohr
--there
is
a
greater
probability
that
the
court
is
going
to
find
that
he
needs
to
be
incarcerated
to
protect
society,
but
apparently
that
is
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
i
have
considered
that.
for
an
indigent,
it
really
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
difference.
he
can't
pay
the
fine,
and
if
it
is
a
condition
of
being
free,
he
is
not
free.
by
definition,
he
can't
pay
it,
so
he
is
going
to
go
to
jail,
regardless
of
what
the
judges
do.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
no,
there
was
no
security.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
right.
it
would
have
an
effect,
i
think,
possibly
on
the
trial
court's
decisions
on
close
cases.
for
example,
in
this
case,
where
a
person
is
employed
and
it
looks
like
he
might
become
unemployed,
the
court
may
say,
well,
i
am
not
going
to
fool
with
a
fine.
let
me
just
impose
a
jail
term.
that
may
be
the
result.
i
should--
mr.
james
h.
lohr
--i
believe
so,
and
i
believe,
justice
blackmun,
you
did
not
entirely
disapprove
of
that.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
it
may
very
well
do
that.
just
because...
if
it
is
in
fact
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
i
don't
think
that
we
necessarily
can
look
at
the
results
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
i
think
that
if
a
person
wilfully
fails
to
pay
the
fine,
or
squanders
his
resources--
mr.
james
h.
lohr
--whether
or
not
he
made
a
bona
fide
effort?
mr.
james
h.
lohr
i
don't
believe
it
is.
if
the
condition
of
probation
that
an
indigent--
mr.
james
h.
lohr
--i
think
that
is
where
my
argument
would
lead
me,
yes.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
i...
could
you
repeat
that,
please?
mr.
james
h.
lohr
well,
it
seems
to...
yes,
i
think
so.
restitution
i
don't
think
carries
any
greater
state
interest
than
does
the
payment
of
the
fine,
and
of
course
that
is
not
the
facts
that
we
have
in
this
case,
but
on
the
other
hand,
you
just...
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
leave
the
trial
courts
with
the
discretion
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
has
made
a
bona
fide
effort
in
order
to
obtain
employment
and
to
obtain
funds,
that
that
is
just...
it
is
just
opening
the
door.
i
just
don't
see
how
a
trial
court
is
going
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
yes,
judge
loggins
did
mention
that.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
and
he
also
mentioned
that
he
recognized
that
there
were
times
when
people
cannot
find
a
job,
even
though
they
try.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
that's
correct.
that's
in
his
testimony.
there
is
no
doubt--
mr.
james
h.
lohr
--no,
i
didn't
forget
that.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
that's
correct,
and
in
fact,
if
there
was
a
record
showing
that
the
provisions
in
stevens
versus
state
had
been
complied
with,
technically,
he
could
have
been
sentenced,
i
suppose,
for
20
years
with
ten
years
concurrent.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
the
original
sentencing
judge
was
three
years'
probation
on
one
count
and
one
year
on
the
other.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
that's
correct.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
by
a
different
judge,
and
at
the
probation
revocation
hearing
there
was
no
attempt
to
determine
at
that
time
whether
or
not
his
status
with
respect
to
his
threat
to
society,
with
respect
to
the
possibility
of
rehabilitation,
with
respect
to
these
other
state
interests,
these
weren't
even--
mr.
james
h.
lohr
--he
would
have
had
to
serve
approximately
two
and
a
half
years
in
jail,
but
the
department
of
corrections
would
have
given
him
credit
for
good
days,
and
so
forth.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
merely
of
the
way
it
was
applied.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
i
believe
it
is.
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
james
h.
lohr
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
just
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
as
i
understand
the
state's
position,
it
is
that
the
petitioner's
loss
of
his
job
and
his
inability
to
pay
his
fine
and
restitution
placed
him
in
the
position
of
being
easily
led
to
commit
another
crime.
i
disagree
with
that.
i
believe
it
is
a
false
assumption,
the
one
that
was
disapproved
of
in
griffin
versus
illinois.
and
the
state
seems
to
be
riding
a
different
horse.
it
is
not
saying
that
the
failure
to
pay
the
fine
and
the
restitution
was...
caused
him
to
be
a
greater
threat
to
society.
it
was
his
indigency.
in
other
words,
the
real
reason
for
the
revocation
of
his
probation
was
his
indigency.
with
regard
to
public
confidence,
it
is
hard
to
pin
down,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
people
are
not
going
to
have
much
faith
in
a
criminal
justice
system
that
puts
an
individual
in
jail
because
he
is
poor
and
under
the
same
circumstances
when
a
rich
person
is
going
to
be
able
to
go
free.
in
rodriguez,
this
court
reviewed
griffin,
douglas,
williams,
and
tate,
and
in
justice
powell's
opinion
it
was
stated
that
where
a
person
because
of
lack
of
wealth
was
completely
unable
to
pay
for
a
benefit,
and
as
a
result
there
was
an
absolute
deprivation
of
that
benefit,
that
the
court
has
struck
down
those
types
of
state
actions,
and
i
submit
that
in
this
case,
because
of
his
lack
of
wealth,
he
was
unable
to
pay
for
the
benefits
which
flow
from
being
on
first
offender's
probation,
and
that
he
was
completely
deprived
of
those
benefits.
for
these
reasons,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
georgia
court
of
appeals.
