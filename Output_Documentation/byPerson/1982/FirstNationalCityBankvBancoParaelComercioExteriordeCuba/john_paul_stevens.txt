justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
wilkins,
may
i
ask
you,
looking
at
this
case
at
the
time
the
litigation
started,
the
very
day
it
started,
what
was
the
governmental
function
in
your
view
that
bancec
was
performing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
government-owned
corporation
in
cuba
that
could
be
performing
a
non-governmental
function
under
your
view
of
the
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
am
just
asking
your
view.
i
am
trying
to
understand
what
your
position
is
as
to
how
we
distinguish
between
a
governmental
function
and
a
non-governmental
function
in
cuban-owned
entities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
are
they
all
governmental?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
do
we
get...
you
say
that
is
the
key
inquiry
in
this
case.
how
do
we--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
can't
give
me
an
example,
i
take
it,
of
a
cuban
government-owned
inquiry
that
would
pass
your
test...
enterprise
that
would
pass
your
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
mean
by
name,
but
just
by
concept.
can
you...
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--now,
how
does
that
differ
from
this
export
company?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical.
supposing
they
had
a
separate
entity
that
did
nothing
but
supervise
the
export
of
sugar.
that
is
all
they
did.
they
wanted
to
make
as
much
money
as
they
could
exporting
sugar.
could
that...
would
that
company
be
a
government...
which
category
would
it
fall
into?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
krinsky,
may
i
just
throw
out--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
just
one
question
please?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
krinsky,
do
we
look
at
the
case
as
of
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed,
or
as
of
today?
there
has
been
about
a
20-year
lapse
of
time,
and
there
is
material
in
the
record
that
suggests
very
strongly
that
the
ownership
of
the
claim
now
is
in
the
government
itself,
or
much
more
closely
so
than
in
bancec.
