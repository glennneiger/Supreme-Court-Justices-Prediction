mr.
harfield,
you
don't
contend
that
bancec
is
somehow
unable
to
proceed
in
the
litigation
because
it
was
dissolved,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
take
that
position
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
didn't
argue
that
because
bancec
was
dissolved,
it
couldn't
proceed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
argue
below
that
regardless
of
bancec's
situation,
that
you
could
assert
the
counterclaim
in
any
event
because
the
cuban
government
or
banco
nacional
had
appeared?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
courts
below
didn't
really
resolve
the
question
about
whether
the
assets
had
gone
to
banco
nacional
at
one
time
or
had
gone
to
the
cuban
government.
it
seemed
to
base
it
on
the
fact
that
bancec
was
an
alter
ego
of
the
cuban
government.
so
they
didn't
decide
the
other--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wilkins,
the
asset
control
regulations
were
developed
to
try
to
ensure
that
all
creditors
in
this
country
of
cuba
were
treated
fairly,
i
suppose,
in
any
final
settlement
that
the
united
states
would
make
with
cuba.
would
your
view
in
this
case
have
a
tendency
to
defeat
the
purposes
of
the
asset
control
regulation
approach?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
would
it
be
your
position
that
in
all
countries
in
which
a
corporation
is
owned
and
managed
by
a
foreign
government,
that
we
should
treat
it
the
same
way
as
this
case
and
hold
that
company
liable
for
any
illegal
acts
of
the
government?
