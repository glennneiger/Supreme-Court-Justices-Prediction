mr.
henry
harfield
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
was
begun
by
a
cuban
government
instrumentality
in
february,
1961.
the
cuban
government
instrumentality,
banco
para
el
comercio
exterior
de
cuba,
which
translates
to
bank...
the
foreign
trade
bank
of
cuba,
and
which
for
convenience
we
are
going
to
call
bancec,
was
suing
to
recover
a
sum
of
money.
in
its
answer,
the
defendant,
which
i
am
going
to
call
citibank,
again
for
the
sake
of
convenience,
in
its
answer,
citibank
alleged
that
the
action
was
brought
by
and
for
the
republic
of
cuba,
bancec
being
a
mere
segment
or
instrumentality,
an
indistinguishable
and
integral
part
of
the
cuban
government.
citibank
then
asserted
as
a
defensive
counterclaim
to
curtail
the
sum
of
money
that
was
sought
by
bancec
in
this
case
its
claim
for
an
amount
of
money
equivalent
to
the
value
of
its
properties
in
cuba,
its
eleven
branches
that
had
been
confiscated,
taken
without
any
compensation
by
the
cuban
government
in
a
manner
which
the
second
circuit
from
which
this
case
comes
has
held
was
in
violation
of
international
law.
the
issue
framed,
the
threshold
issue
framed
by
the
pleadings
was
therefore
in
this
claim
and
counterclaim,
are
the
claimant
and
the
counterclaimant
opposing
parties?
the
question
here
is
who
is
the
real
claimant,
as
put
in
issue
by
that
answer.
now,
some
three
weeks
after
the
commencement
of
this
action
by
bancec
the
cuban
government
dissolved
bancec
and
exercised
direct
dominion
over
all
of
bancec's
assets,
including
the
claim
in
this
case.
thereafter,
some
several
months
later,
the
respondent
sought
and
obtained
from
the
court
in
which
the
action
was
pending
leave
to
substitute
the
republic
of
cuba
as
the
plaintiff
in
the
action,
and
that
leave
was
granted,
and
leave
was
granted
to
file
a
supplemental
complaint
in
which
it
was
alleged
that
the
claim
which
is
the
subject
of
this
action
was
assumed
by
the
republic
of
cuba.
now,
that
supplemental
complaint
was
never
formally
filed.
it
was
just
approved
for
filing
by
the
court
at
the
instance
of
the
respondent.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
this
was
an
application
by
counsel
for
a
party
to
substitute
another
party,
another
person
as
the
party
plaintiff,
and
the
court
in
this
case
on
stipulation,
on
the
agreement
of
the
defendant,
said
it
is
so
ordered.
you
may.
this
was
an
application
for
leave
to
substitute.
so
that
technically
it
did
not
effect
a
substitution.
it
was
leave
to
substitute.
they
asked
for
it.
they
asked
for
permission.
they
got
the
permission.
then
i
suppose
they
changed
their
mind.
mr.
henry
harfield
yes,
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
am
troubled
by
that,
justice
o'connor.
i
should
think
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
bancec
as
such
to
proceed
in
the
litigation,
and
if
i--
mr.
henry
harfield
--we
simply
took
the
position
that
there
was
an
identity
between
bancec
or,
if
you
like,
between
bancec's
ghost
and
the
republic
of
cuba,
the
cuban
government.
mr.
henry
harfield
no,
we
did
not
argue
that
the
act
of
dissolution
was
what
did
it.
we
said
that
in
effect
there
hadn't
been
anything
there
in
the
first
place.
mr.
henry
harfield
we
did
not
put
it
on
the
ground
of
an
appearance
by
the
cuban
government
or
banco
nacional.
we
argued
that
there...
and
the
district
court
after
trial
found
that
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
litigation,
there
was
a
commonality
among
the
cuban
government,
banco
nacional,
bancec
when
bancec
was
in
existence.
mr.
henry
harfield
there
is...
i
think
it
was
decided,
justice
o'connor.
the
language
is
somewhat
obscure
and
repetitious,
and
i
think
it
is
a
mistake,
unfortunate
that
we
talk
about
alter
ego
or
the
like.
what
we
are
really
talking
about
here
is
whether,
as
used
to
be
the
case
back
in
the
days
of
the
alien
property
custodian,
whether
there
is
a
cloaking
operation
by
a
corporation.
the
trial
judge
certainly
used
the
words
"alter
ego",
but
his...
or
one
of
his
overall
statements
as
to
his
findings
was
that
no
matter
how
regarded,
whether
this
was...
the
circumstances,
the
relationship
of
bancec
during
its
existence
and
the
cuban
government,
taken
together
with
the
devolution
of
the
claim,
as
he
put
it,
upon
bancec's
dissolution,
made
it
clear
that
the
claim
was
now
the
claim
of
the
republic
of
cuba
or
of
banco
nacional
which
had
been
held
to
be
the
alter
ego
of
the
republic
of
cuba,
that
it
was
in
effect...
the
republic
of
cuba
was
the
party
opposed
in
interest,
the
protagonist
of
this
case.
and
that
is
what
really
we
were
looking
for
down
there,
was
what
the
court
was
looking
for:
who
is
pushing
this
case?
mr.
henry
harfield
well,
i
think
that's
one
way
of
formulating
it.
i
have
used
the
word
"protagonist"
because
i
am
trying
to
avoid
these
mystique
words
or
phrases
of
art,
such
as
"real
party
in
interest"
and
"alter
ego".
i
think
the
question
is,
who
is
the
person
who
is
pushing
this
claim,
and
the
best
word
i
find
for
that
in
the
dictionary
is
the
protagonist.
i'm
not
sure
that
answers
your
question.
mr.
henry
harfield
yes,
and
i
am
perfectly
content
to
accept
that
as
the
real
party
in
interest.
indeed,
i
think
we
used
that
phrase
in
the
pleadings.
mr.
henry
harfield
is
the
real
party
in
interest
and
has
been
throughout,
and
in
that
context,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that...
one
other
fact
here.
after
the
government
of
cuba
had
dissolved
bancec
and,
shall
i
say,
retrieved
the
claim
in
this
case,
after
this
stipulation
had
been
entered
in
the
court
in
1961,
some
14
years
later
but
still
before
trial,
the
respondent
asked
that
another
cuban
government
instrumentality,
short
name
cubazucar,
be
substituted
as
the
party
plaintiff,
because
that
was,
if
you
like,
then
the
real
party
in
interest.
there
had
been
this
succession.
i
think
real
party
in
interest
is
a
proper
way
to
examine
it.
the
question
as
i
see
it--
mr.
henry
harfield
--is
that
the
task
of
the
trial
judge,
the
factfinding
task
that
he
had
was
to
find
out
who
is
pushing
the
claim
and
who
is
pushing
the
counterclaim.
mr.
henry
harfield
yes,
he
did.
mr.
henry
harfield
so
did
i.
what
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
henry
harfield
--yes,
i
knew
that.
0
[generallaughter.]
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
they
agreed
with
the
district
court's
description
of
the
functions
of
bancec
and
its
status
as
a
wholly
owned
instrumentality
of
the
government
of
cuba,
but
it
disagreed
with
its
conclusions,
and
there
we
come
to
what
is,
i
think,
the
real
mischief
in
this
case,
or
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
because
what
they
did
was
in
effect
to
reverse
the
whole
procedure,
and
they
said
bancec
is
set
up,
notwithstanding
our
agreement
as
to
the
status
of
the
functions
for
the
district
court
and
found
it
was
a
cloak,
but
they
said
bancec...
the
origin
of
bancec's
claim
was
a
commercial
transaction.
the
origin
of
the
counterclaim
was
not
a
commercial
transaction.
bancec,
when
it
was
in
existence,
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
matter
of
the
counterclaim.
therefore
you
can't
oppose
these.
you
can
understand
that
argument,
but
what
they
said
was,
because
you
can't
oppose
these,
they
are
not
alter
egos,
and
that
leaves
me
completely
confused.
mr.
henry
harfield
the
basis
for
the
counterclaim?
mr.
henry
harfield
it
was
characterized
as
a
breach
of
international
law.
and
we
have...
we
were
here
before
on
the
question...
in
the
banco
nacional
case,
on
the
question
of
whether
that
counterclaim
could
be
asserted
notwithstanding
the
active
state
doctrine,
which
is
something
i
hope
we
don't
have
to
reargue
today.
but
the...
at
that
time
the
holding...
this
court
sent
that
banco
nacional
case
back
to
the
second
circuit
and
said,
find
out
whether
there
are
any
other
grounds
for
holding
in
favor
of
the
cuban
instrumentality,
in
that
case
banco
nacional,
and
the
second
circuit
said
no.
they
said
banco
nacional
is
the
alter
ego,
if
you
like,
of
the
cuban
government.
number
two,
there
was
a
clear
violation
of
international
law
in
taking
citibank's
branches,
and
on
that
basis
they
held
for
the
city...
for
citibank
in
that
case.
so,
there
you
do
have...
there
is
no
question
that
the
transaction
on
which
the
counterclaim
is
based
is
not
the
same
counterclaim
that
the
claim
is
based
on.
but
rule
13(b)
says
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
the
issue
is
not
the
opposition
of
the
origin
of
the
claims
but
the
opposition
of
the
parties
in
interest,
of
the
claimant
and
counterclaimant,
and
the
relief
that
is
sought
is
precisely
the
same.
we
are
just
talking
about
money.
this
isn't
a
question
of
trying
to
recapture
property
that
was
taken
there.
mr.
henry
harfield
i
think
it
is
unwholesome
to
put
words
in
the
appellate
court's
mouth.
my
guess
was
that
that
was
the
only
way
they
could
think
of
to
come
out
where
they
wanted.
i
simply
can't...
i
can't
answer
the
question
because
i
can't
understand
it.
the
net
effect
of
this
was
that
we
have
a
finding
by
the
district
court
that
there
was
an
identity
of
interest.
we
have
the
second
circuit
saying,
we
find
that
because
the
transactions
didn't
mesh,
it
didn't...
they
are
not
the
same
party,
and
i
think
that
is
clearly...
the
court
of
appeals
was
clearly
in
error.
now,
the
mischief
of
this
is
that
what
they
are
doing
is
to
impose
a
test
which
in
effect
forms
a
blueprint
for
any
foreign
government
that
chooses
to
do
so
by
arranging
its
own
wardrobe,
if
you
like,
in
a
proper
fashion,
to
come
in
here
as
a
plaintiff
and
escape
the
liabilities
that
would
attach
if
it
came
in
on
its
own,
the
liabilities
that
would
attach
by
reason
of
set
off
counterclaim
or
other
defenses,
other
defenses.
the
respondent
goes
a
great
deal
farther
than
the
court
of
appeals
did.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error.
they
are
making
new
law
if
this
decision
is
allowed
to
stand.
but
what
the
respondent
is
urging
is
that
the
presumption,
which
everyone
admits,
the
presumption
of
independence
of
a
corporation,
is
in
effect
a
conclusive
presumption
if
it
is
a
foreign
corporation,
a
foreign
government
corporation.
he
says
foreign
government
corporations
are
sui
generis,
and
in
effect
whatever
is
said
about
them
by
their
parent
government
must
be
taken.
this
precludes
inquiry
by
a
court--
mr.
henry
harfield
--well,
if
you
carry
that
to
its
extreme,
it
certainly
is
dragging
the
act
of
state
doctrine
in
the
back
door
and
it
is
like
dragging
the
cat
back
in
the
back
door
after
the
cat
has
had
kittens,
because
there
is
a
lot
more
to
it
than
just
the
plain
act
of
state
doctrine.
my
peroration
of
this,
i
sum
up
the
situation,
the
position...
the
petitioner's
position
is
this,
that
there
can
be
no
serious
doubt
that
the
republic
of
cuba
is
the
real
protagonist,
the
real
party
in
interest
in
this
case,
and
that
the
parties
opposed
in
interest
are
the
republic
of
cuba
and
citibank.
neither
under
international
law
nor
under
federal
law...
under
both
international
and
federal
law,
the
consequence
of
that
fact
is
that
citibank
is
entitled
to
curtail
the
recovery
that
is
sought
in
this
case,
and
that
right
of
curtailment,
the
right
to
assert
that
defense
effectively,
should
not
be
defeated
in
this
case
because
the
order
to
take
over
citibank's
branches,
which
is
the
basis
for
their
counterclaim,
because
that
order
was
signed
by
che
guevera
as
president
of
bancec
instead
of
che
guevera
as
president
of
banco
nacional.
the
normal
consequences
flowing
from
both
federal
and
international
law,
which
is
that
the
question
of
the
identity
of
a
party
is
a
matter
for
the
forum
to
determine,
that
can't
be
and
shouldn't
be
averted
by
being
bound,
handicapping
the
court,
handcuffing
the
court
if
a
foreign
government
simply
says
the
immunity
that
we
confer,
the
characteristics
that
we
confer
on
a
creature
of
ours
in
our
country
are
binding
on
you
in
your
country.
there,
i
think,
is
the
danger
of
what
will
come
about,
and
that,
of
course,
is
something
that
i
think
invokes
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
as
to
which
i
don't
pretend
to
speak.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
henry
harfield
just
this,
that
i
think
that
what
has
been
indicated
by
the
respondent's
argument
is
that
the
case
must
be
either
looked
at
on
the
facts
of
the
case
where
we
have
findings
or
it
must
be
looked
at
in
terms
of
the
generalities.
as
far
as
the
generalities
are
concerned,
which
mr.
krinsky
has
discussed,
i
think
he
is
wrong
on
them,
but
i
think
where
he
is
mainly
wrong
is
in
his
election
to
speak
for
what
the
policy
of
the
united
states
and
what
the
interest
of
the
united
states
ought
to
be.
i
have
really
nothing
to
add
unless
the
court
has
further
questions.
