mr.
michael
krinsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
mr.
justice
white's
question
about
the
source
of
law.
in
the
first
instance,
we
believe
it
is
international
law,
and
there
is
a
substantial
body
of
law,
of
international
law
precisely
upon
the
question
before
the
court.
all
countries,
or
almost
all
countries
conduct
much
of
their
trade
through
government
corporations.
the
third
world
countries,
100
or
so
of
them,
have
staked
much
of
their
aspirations
and
economies
on
these
corporations,
and
the
socialist
countries
conduct
all
of
their
trade
through
these
enterprises.
the
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
this
respondent
and
all
these
other
enterprises
does
not
withstand
analysis.
that
is
an
analysis
indeed
that
is
not
even
undertaken
by
the
petitioner
and
the
government
in
their
briefs.
when
one
looks
at
those
institutions,
one
sees
exactly
the
same
things
as
said
here
about
the
respondent.
there
is
the
fact
that
all
of
their
capital
is
provided
by
the
government.
there
is
the
fact
that
all
of
their
profits
go
to
the
state's
treasury.
there
is
the
fact
that
their
boards
are
dominated
by
ministers
or
the
representatives
of
ministers.
mr.
michael
krinsky
this
is
the
points
in
common
between
this
corporation
and
most
of
the
government
corporations
of
the
world,
particularly
the
third
world.
they
perform
governmental...
they
pursue
governmental
purposes.
they
implement
governmental
policies,
just
as
the
respondent
did
here,
but
through
their
commercial
acts,
just
as
the
respondent
did
here.
and
it
is
this
last
factor
which
is
stressed
perhaps
most
strongly
by
the
government
and
petitioner
in
their
brief.
but
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
is
misplaced.
congress
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
came
to
the
conclusion,
as
every
other
country
has,
that
all
these
government
corporations
pursue
governmental
purposes,
and
for
that
reason
it
held
that
the
proper
inquiry
between
commercial
and
governmental
is
the
nature
of
the
act
involved,
not
its
purpose.
and
this
indeed
is
a
rule
of
international
law.
the
federal
constitutional
court
of
germany
in
the
empire
of
iran
case,
the
english
courts
in
the
primaro
congresso
case,
and
this
court
in
dunhill
have
said
precisely
that
about
the
entire
law
of
state
training.
one
must
look
to
the
nature
of
the
act
rather
than
its
purpose.
there
is
no
reason
to
identify
respondent
on
that
basis
more
closely
with
its
government
than
there
is
to
identify
any
of
these
hundreds
of
other
corporations
of
the
world
with
their
government.
the
english
cases
have
indeed
decided
issues
quite
close
to
that
presented
here,
and
they
have
held
that
government
corporations,
including
cuban
government
corporations,
including
the
successor
to
this
respondent,
is
not
to
be
identified
with
the
state.
it
is
not
responsible
for
the
acts
of
the
state,
nor
is
the
state
for
its
acts.
and
the
basis
upon
which
it
reached
that
conclusion
was
one
of
international
law.
in
trendex,
lord
denning
and
other
members
of
the
court,
and
in
all
of
the
cases,
said,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
enterprise
is
to
be
identified
with
the
state
for
purposes
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
then
later
in
the
primero
congresso
case,
for
purposes
of
separate
liability,
is
itself
a
question
of
international
law,
and
the
definition
and
the
line
given
by
the
house
of
lords
in
primero
congresso,
the
cuban
case,
was
whether
this
is
a
familiar
institution
in
the
international
scene.
is
this
a
familiar
corporation,
established
by
governments
throughout
the
world?
and
the
answer
in
that
case
was
yes,
and
the
answer
in
this
case,
upon
analysis
and
comparison,
must
also
be
yes.
i
think,
to
answer
justice
o'connor's
question,
the
impact
of
a
ruling
disregarding
the
separate
status
of
this
enterprise
indeed
would
be
broad.
it
could
not
be
broader,
because
it
is
not
different.
it
is
not
different
in
its
functions,
and
it
is
not
different
in
its
relationship
to
its
government.
mr.
michael
krinsky
exactly,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly
right.
the
international
practice
goes
beyond
the
fact
that
all
of
the
countries
have
such
corporations
and
assert
a
claim
for
the
recognition
of
their
international...
their
independent
status.
this
question,
it
has
been
thought,
was
settled
a
long
time
ago
in
international
law
by
that
extensive
network
of
bilateral
treaties
between
the
socialist
countries
and
the
capitalist
world
dating
back
to
the
1920's,
by
which
it
was...
by
which
two
things
were
recognized:
one,
that
sovereign
immunity
is
inappropriate
for
commercial
activity;
and
two,
part
and
parcel
of
that
accommodation
that
the
limited
liability
of
government
corporations
would
be
recognized,
and
that
is
the
basis
of
international
law
of
state
trading,
both
in
respect
to
sovereign
immunity
and
in
respect
to
limited
liability.
mr.
michael
krinsky
your
honor,
the
district
court
stated
that
this
corporation
was
closest
to,
in
his
view,
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation.
mr.
michael
krinsky
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not,
but
it
was
for
a
long
time,
and
of
course--
mr.
michael
krinsky
--and
of
course
one
of
its
successors
is
the
export-import
bank
of
the
united
states.
but
the
major
impact
of
departing
from
this
rule
of
international
law
and
this
international
practice
is
not
on
united
states
government
corporations,
but
will
be
in
the
judgment
of
congress
upon
united
states
private
corporations,
because
the
multinational
enterprise,
the
system
of
a
united
states
private
parent
corporation
owning
subsidiaries
incorporated
abroad
would
be
undermined,
because
these
institutions
are
under
attack
in
the
international
arena.
the
relationship
between
the
parent
and
the
subsidiary
has
been
described
in
precisely
the
same
terms
used
to
describe
the
respondent
here.
and
the
judicial
distinction
between
parent
and
subsidiary
has
been
denounced...
denounced
fervently
as
a
fiction
which
should
be
disregarded
according
to
the
notions
of
equity
and
international
justice
and
national
interests
of
the
forum.
and
congress,
in
its
consideration
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
said
that
this
is
a
dangerous
trend,
and
we
do
not
want
to
encourage
it.
we
do
not
want
to
give
excuse
for
this
essentially
politically
motivated
chain
of
events.
mr.
michael
krinsky
and
there
is...
and
the
way
to
do
that
is
to...
and
if
we
treated--
mr.
michael
krinsky
--if
i
might
just
finish--
mr.
michael
krinsky
--government
corporations
differently,
we
would
provide
that
excuse.
excuse
me.
mr.
michael
krinsky
no,
i
have
finished,
sir.
mr.
michael
krinsky
now,
we
believe
congress
has
codified
the
separate
entity
principle
into
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
but
even
if
the
statute
is
not
clear
enough,
and
even
if
the
international
practice
is
not
clear
enough
by
their
own
force
to
provide
a
rule
of
law,
we
believe
nonetheless
they
represent
clear
and
consistent
expressions
of
policy
by
congress
and
by
the
international
community.
and
we
think,
given
their
source,
they
should
prevail
in
the
formation
of
any
rule
of
common...
rule
of
federal
common
law
here.
if
there
is
disagreement
about
those
policies,
if
they
are
not
clear,
then
we
think
petitioner
and
the
executive
should
go
to
congress,
because
congress
is
the
branch
of
government
which
resolves
such
policy
matters.
and
that
is...
we
think
that's
the
teaching
of
the
court's
decisions
on
federal
common
law
generally,
and
we
think
as
well
that
that
teaching
is
underlined
strongly
by
the
prior
cuban
cases
in
this
court.
whatever
controversy
there
might
have
been
over
the
role
of
the
courts
there,
there
was,
i
suggest,
broad
agreement
that
the
role
in
this
area
is
more
modest
and
more
limited
than
normal,
and
that
the
court
acting
as
a
national
court,
as
it
must,
is
on
firmer
ground
when
it
seeks
to
apply
international
law
than
when
it
is
asked
to
frame
a
rule
of
law
on
its
own.
and
that
is
precisely
what
respondent...
or
what
petitioner
and
the
united
states
have
asked.
it
is,
moreover,
we
suggest,
difficult
to
understand
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
itself
could
come
to
a
conclusion
of
what
proper
policy
is
here.
there
is
not
the
facile
distinction
that
this
respondent
somehow
is
different
than
the
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
other
government
corporations
in
the
world.
we
have
shown
that
it
is
not.
but
more
critically,
there
will
be...
there
is
the
question
of
whether
the
court
can
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
run
the
risks
of
fueling
this
chain
of
events
that
congress...
of
undermining
the
stability
of
trade
based
upon
the
limited
liability
of
these
government
corporations.
mr.
michael
krinsky
for
the
sake
of--
mr.
michael
krinsky
--for
the
sake
of
what
the
petitioner
seeks.
mr.
michael
krinsky
your
honor,
let
me
address
the
question
of
where
the
ownership
is
now.
our
position
is
that
the
ownership
is
in
a
state
trading
corporation
by
the
name
of
cubazucar.
it
is
the
same
corporation
which
was
involved
in
the
primero
congresso
case
in
the
house
of
lords,
and
which
was
held
to
be
a
separate
entity,
not
responsible
for
the
acts
of
the
cuban
government
in
that
case.
we
assert,
and
our
position
has
always
been
in
the
district
court,
that
the
claim
went
from
bancec
to
the
state
entesis.
we
made
a
motion
to
substitute
this
state
impressor
as
the
successor.
it
was
denied
by
the
district
court
because
it
did
not
want
to
introduce
into
the
case,
which
it
considered
a
complicated
case,
new
issues,
and
the
new
issue
that
was
excluded
was
precisely
what
happened
upon
the
dissolution
of
bancec.
and
that
is
how
the
case
was
tried.
it
was
tried
by
the
plaintiff
that
way
and
it
was
tried
by
the
defendant
that
way,
and
indeed,
when
one
looks
at
the
post-trial
requests
for
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
by
the
respondent...
i'm
sorry,
by
the
petitioner,
there
is
no
request
for
a
finding
as
to
the
identity
of
who
held
the
claim
after
bancec.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
did
not
introduce
expert
testimony
on
what
is
a
question
of
foreign
law.
and
indeed,
if
that
issue
is
still
in
the
case,
despite
it
having
been
excluded
in
this
way,
we
believe
that
we
should
be
entitled
to
an
opportunity
of
introducing
that
expert
testimony
on
foreign
law.
now,
on
the
merits
of
the
claim,
we
have
always
taken
the
position
that
upon
bancec's
dissolution,
the
claim
went
to
the
succeeding
state
enterprise,
and
if
one
reads
law
number
934,
which
is
the
critical
law
here,
it
says
bancec
is
dissolved
and
its
assets
are
transferred
to
the
new
state
enterprises.
it
is
in
the
present
tense.
we
think
there
was
no
foundation,
no
foundation
in
the
record
for
this
position,
and
indeed,
it
is
not
procedurally
proper,
properly
in
the
case
any
longer.
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
situation,
however,
in
which
the
case
properly
should
be
looked
at,
i
think,
from
the
vantage
point
of
the
present
day,
and
that
is
the
impact
of
the
freeze
regulations
and
what
congress
has
done
on
the
question
of
separate
entity,
the
question
of
nationalizations
in
general
and
cuba,
cuban
nationalizations
in
particular.
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
what
issue
of
policy
or
equity
relevant
to
this
case
has
not
been
addressed
by
congress
and
answered
by
congress.
congress
had
ratified
the
freeze
of
all
property
in
the
united
states
of
cuba,
of
cuban
government
corporations,
and
of
cuban
nationals.
any
recovery
by
this
respondent
will
become
frozen,
and
that
can
hardly
give
foreign
countries
any
encouragement
in
the
belief
that
they
can
nationalize
the
united
states'
own
property
without
consequence
for
the
property
of
their
government
corporations
in
the
united
states.
mr.
michael
krinsky
your
honor,
we
have
been
instructed
by
our
client
to
litigate
the
issue,
and
we
have
not
been
told
the
reason
why.
the
congress
has
said
something
else
here
of
great
importance,
and
that
is
on
the
question
of
equity.
it
established
a
program
of
certifying
nationalization
claims,
not
just
citibank's
claims,
all
nationalization
claims,
and
the
foreign
claims
settlement
commission
has
met
for
many
years
and
has
certified
claims
of
individuals,
of
corporations.
and
the
reason
why
congress
did
that
was
to
provide
an
equitable
basis
for
the
distribution
of
all
frozen
funds
in
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
a
settlement.
the
result
here
of
a
judgment
in
favor
of
petitioner
would
be
contrary
to
that
policy.
equity
in
this
case,
according
to
the
congress,
is
that
the
funds
be
available
for
distribution
to
all
the
claimants,
not
that
citibank
obtains
a
preference.
and
it
is,
again,
we
suggest,
the
interest
of
the
united
states
and
the
equitable
notions
of
the
united
states
as
established
by
congress
which
should
govern
this
controversy.
there
is,
your
honor,
a
notion
in
these
cases
of
looking
to
the
overall
interests
of
the
united
states.
there
is,
however,
counterposed
to
this
who
is
to
define
those
interests
and
what
are
the
sources
of
law
to
govern.
we
have
argued,
we
believe,
that
international
law
provides
that
basis.
there
is
no
distinction
between
this
respondent
and
other
government
corporations.
the
rule
of
law
which
allows
each
case,
each
government
corporation
to
be
evaluated
according
to
the
local
law
of
the
forum
will
leave
nothing,
nothing
of
the
international
law
of
state
trading
and
government
corporations.
all
that
would
be
left
is
all
government
corporations
in
doubt,
and
every
country
invited
to
apply
its
own
notions
of
what
is
a
proper
government
corporation,
and
indeed
precisely
as
congress
feared,
each
country
will
be
invited
to
apply
its
local
notions
of
what
is
a
proper
private
corporation
and
what
is
the
proper
relationship
between
a
parent
corporation,
a
united
states
parent
corporation
and
its
subsidiary.
we
think
that
is
a
result
which
has
no
basis
in
law,
and
to
the
extent
that
policy
concerning
it
is
to
be
changed,
it
should
be
done
by
congress
or
by
the
executive
in
the
international
area
advocating
a
different
position.
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
is
all
i
have
to
say.
