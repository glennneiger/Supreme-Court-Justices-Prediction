mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
united
states
believes
that
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
or
not
an
instrumentality
of
a
foreign
state
could
bring
suit
in
united
states
court
should
be
insulated
from
a
counterclaim
properly
asserted
against
the
state
on
the
sole
basis
that
that
state
instrumentality
did
not
play
a
key
role
in
the
wrongful
conduct
of
the
state.
the
court
of
appeals
has
answered
this
question
in
the
affirmative,
and
by
so
doing,
has
rendered
irrelevant
a
broad
range
of
legal
and
equitable
factors
that
united
states
courts
and
foreign
courts
have
traditionally
analyzed
in
attributing
responsibility
between
and
among
nominally
separate
corporate
entities.
the
united
states
has
a
significant
interest
in
addressing
or
suggesting
that
this
is
an
erroneous
approach,
because
by
limiting
the
alter
ego
question
to
a
single
narrow
factor,
that
is,
whether
or
not
the
state
entity
played
a
key
role
in
wrongful
conduct,
the
court
below
has
unnecessarily
and
unduly
restricted
the
ability
of
american
defendants
to
raise
valid
counterclaims
in
suits
brought
against
them
by
foreign
governments.
respondent
in
this
court
would
go
even
further
than
the
court
of
appeals.
he
argues,
or
it
argues
that
international
law
requires
this
court
to
apply
cuban
law,
not
only
to
establish
its
separate
identity,
but
also
its
absolute
non-liability
for
the
acts
of
the
cuban
state.
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
didn't
even
go
this
far
when
it
recognized
that
bancec's
separate
status
under
cuban
law
could
and
would
be
disregarded
if
bancec
did
indeed
play
a
key
role
in
the
wrongful
conduct
of
the
state.
international
law,
moreover,
although
it
is
exhaustively
examined
by
respondent,
does
no
more
than
establish
a
presumption,
which
we
recognize,
that
united
states
and
other
foreign
courts
will
generally
recognize
the
independent
status
of
bancec.
that
presumption,
however,
is
not
conclusive.
united
state
courts
and
foreign
courts
have
never
held
that
foreign
law
is
conclusive
on
the
alter
ego
question.
we
cite
many
cases
in
our
brief
where
that
inquiry
is
undertaken.
lord
denning
of
the
british
court
of
appeals
in
the
trentex
trading
corporation
case
stated
that
whether
a
state-owned
entity
should
be
considered
the
alter
ego
of
its
parent
should
not
depend
on
foreign
law
alone.
rather,
he
stated,
he
would
"look
to
all
the
evidence
to
see
whether
the
organization
was
under
government
control
and
exercising
governmental
functions.
"
the
error
of
the
court
below
is
that
it
pretermits
this
sort
of
inquiry
that
courts
throughout
the
world
have
found
necessary
to
resolve
this
alter
ego
question.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
the
source
of
the
law.
in
this
case
it
is--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--well,
the
rule...
generally
courts
who
have
examined
the
alter
ego
question
in
the
context
of
state-owned
entities
have
focused
on
two
particular
factors,
the
extent
of
government
control
and
whether
or
not--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--well,
it's--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--we
are
suggesting
that
the
united
states
should
apply
federal
law
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes,
as
in
this--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--no.
but
that...
but
that
law...
but
the
federal
rule
that
we
suggest
that
this
court
should
apply
is
in
conformity
with
the
rule
that
we
believe
is
generally
recognized
by
international
law.
this
case--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--no,
it
doesn't.
in
fact,
lord
denning
in
fact
in
trentex
trading
said
that
that...
foreign
law
could
not
be
conclusive.
this
case...
the
procedural
context
of
this
case
simply
cannot
be
ignored.
cuba
has...
or
a
cuban
entity
has
entered
a
united
states
court
to
sue
an
american
defendant
on
an
american
debt
invoking
american
law.
in
that
context...
but
in
that
context
they
seek
to
raise
their
own
law
to
defeat
a
valid
counterclaim.
in
the
republic
of
china
case,
this
court
said
that
a
foreign
entity
simply
cannot
invoke
american
law
free
from
the
claims
of
justice.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
simply
overly
narrowly
confining
the
inquiry.
the
question
before
the
court...
the
united
states
does
not
dispute
that
as
a
matter
of
general
international
law
or
as
domestic
law,
for
that
matter,
bancec
should
be
accorded
the
separate
status
generally
granted
it
under
its
organic
laws,
but
that
is
not
the
question
that
is
before
the
court.
the
petitioners
have
pled
and
proven
before
the
court
of...
before
the
district
court,
that
is,
that
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
cuban
law,
bancec
lacked
a
separate
identity.
it
was
in
reality
a
mere
extension
of
the
cuban
government.
that
question,
the
alter
ego
question
is
at
bottom
a
factual
and
not
a
legal
determination.
and
in
making
that
determination,
a
broad
range
of
considerations
are
relevant,
not
a
single
inquiry:
is
it...
did
it
play
a
key
role
in
the
wrongful
conduct
of
the
state?
as
i
stated
earlier,
courts
generally
in
this
circumstance
have
looked
at
governmental
control,
whether
it
performed
a
governmental
function.
that
is
what
the
district
court
looked
at.
the
court
of
appeals
was
going
to
disregard
all
that
on
the
basis
of
a
single
narrow
factor.
we
believe
that
is
erroneous.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
it
is
a
legal
question.
we
believe
that
the
test
is
a
matter
of
law,
i
mean,
whether
or
not
the
legal
test
is
the--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--well,
the
alter
ego
determination
is
a
factual
question.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes,
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
is
that
the
alter
ego
test,
the
legal
test
for
alter
ego
is
just
one
factor:
did
the
state
entity
play
a
key
role
in
the
wrongful
conduct
of
the
state.
we
say
that
is
an
erroneous
legal
test.
we
are
saying
the
proper
legal
test
takes
note
and
cognizance
of
a
broad
range
of
legal
and
equitable
factors.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
i
haven't
the
foggiest
idea.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
they
didn't
state.
they
said...
they
said,
our
prior
decision
in
banco...
in
the
banco
nacional
case
had
a
precise
basis.
we
would
disregard
the
separate
entity
of
the
state
government
when
they
played
a
key
role
in
the
wrongful
conduct
of
the
state.
where
they
derived
that
test,
i
am
not
certain.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
you
have
to
look
at
bancec...
bancec's
overall
operation
at
the
time.
respondents,
of
course,
would
like
you
to
look
at
a
snapshot
of
a
single
commercial
enterprise,
but
when
you
look
at
the
overall
operation
of
bancec,
it
was
created
to
manage
all
exports
and
imports
on
behalf
of
the
cuban
government.
it
performed
a
banking
function
which
the
cuban
government
itself
said
could
only
be
performed
by
the
state,
and
one
of
its
primary
purposes
was
to
stabilize
the
national
economy,
to
stabilize
their
currency.
it
was,
as
the
court...
the
district
court,
looking
at
all
these
facts,
said
it
was
not
a
mere
private
corporation,
it
was
performing
the
sort
of
a
function
that
even
in
the
united
states
economy
tends
to
be
performed
by--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--i
am
not
certain.
it
is,
as
i
say,
a
factual
sort
of
an
inquiry.
for
that
reason,
respondent's
citation
of
numerous
entities--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--well,
it...
that--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--well,
that
is
a
very
difficult
inquiry,
and
if
you
read--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--it
is
a
key
inquiry.
there
are
precedents,
and
they
are
cited
in
our
brief.
the
house
of
lords,
for
example,
in
the
rolimpex
case
recently
struggled
with
that
inquiry,
and
lord
wilburforce,
for
example,
said,
well,
it
is
difficult,
there
are
many
factors
we
have
to
look
at,
but
just
simply
because
it's
a
difficult
decision
to
make--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--i
am
not
familiar.
there
perhaps
are.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
well,
for
example,
a
very
recent
case
in
the
e
congresso
de
partedel
case
in
the
house
of
lords
again,
that...
the
house
of
lords
determined
that
mambisa,
a
cuban
shipping
company,
was
separate
enough
from
the
state.
it
was
not
subject
to
everyday
control,
et
cetera.
they
went
through
several
factors
to
determine
that
it
was
not
an
organ
of
the
state.
so
i
suppose
that
mambisa
has
been
found
to
be
a
separate
entity,
and
would
be
so
found
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
well,
the
factors
that
the
court
of
appeals...
that
the
house
of
lords
examined
in
the
congresso
case
and
this
case
are
very
diverse.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
determined
that
bancec
in
reality,
no
matter...
we
are
not
looking
at
what
cuba
says
bancec
did.
the
district
court
looked
at
how
bancec
operated.
and
it
determined
on
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence
that
was
before
it
that
it
performed...
that
it
existed
solely
to
manage
exports
and
imports,
manage
it
on
the
basis...
in
some--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--i'm
not
certain.
again,
you
are
giving
me
very
few
facts.
it
is
a
broad-ranging
sort
of
a
consideration.
i
don't
know...
just
because
it
was
exporting
all
sugar
would
not
necessarily
tell
me
enough
to
know
whether
it
was
a
governmental
entity
or
a
non-governmental
entity.
that
you
have
to
look
at...
and
in
that
example
exactly
is
what
respondents
want
you
to
do.
they
want
you
to
look
at
a
snapshot.
this
is
merely
an
export...
a
contract
for
exporting
sugar.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
district
court
properly
looked
at
bancec
in
its
overall
operation,
in
its
overall
sphere,
its
overall
mission.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no.
no,
justice
o'connor.
in
fact,
we
believe
that
the...
that
the
interest
of
the
united
states,
the
overall
interest
of
the
united
states
is
better
served
by
allowing
united
states
litigants
to
raise
valid
expropriation
and
counterclaims
when
they
can
and
when
they
are
justly
founded
in
law
and
fact.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
we
do
not
have,
for
example,
asset
control
regulations
or
a
freeze
with
many
countries
that
expropriate
foreign
assets.
in
fact,
it
is
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
that
we
do
have
such
a
situation,
and
so
the
overall
interest
of
the
united
states
is
furthered
by
assuring
that
united
states
litigants
can
raise
proper
counterclaims
in
these
sorts
of
suits
rather
than
merely
conserving
these
assets
because
we
have
a
freeze
here.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
we
suggest
that
on
a
properly
formulated
alter
ego
test,
any
entity,
whether
it
be
a
private
entity
or
a
state-owned
entity
could
be
subject
to
the
same
test.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
united
states
courts
should
willy-nilly
pierce
the
corporate
vails
of
state
trading
entities
on
a
simple
finding
of
state
control
or
any
other
single
factor.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
presumptive
separate
status
of
these
entities
be
subject
to
a
well-recognized
exception
in
international
and
domestic
law.
that
exception
is
developed
under
the
general
heading
of
alter
ego
law,
and
it
holds
that
that
presumptively
separate
corporate
status
will
be
disregarded
if
it
totally
fails
to
reflect
reality,
and
if
that
disregard
is
necessary
to
prevent
injustice,
and
that
is
all
we
are
arguing,
and
we
would--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--certainly
not,
justice
blackmun.
we--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--i
am
not
certain
that
i
understand
exactly
what
your
concern
is.
we
would--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--yes.
well,
as
i
explained,
or
as
i
tried
to...
attempted
to
explain
to
justice
o'connor,
the
united
states
has
no
general
interest
in
preserving
per
se
this
general
fund.
our
overall
interest
is
preserving
the
ability
of
litigants
to
raise
valid
counterclaims.
now,
in
particular
contexts,
for
example,
in
the
iranian
context,
there
is
a
general
freeze.
there
is
perhaps
a
broader
freeze,
and
in
that
context
perhaps
the
united
states
would
have
an
interest
in
not...
we
don't
even
allow
people
to
bring
claims.
they
are
being
brought
before
a
foreign
arbitral
tribunal.
but
that
is
a
question
that
is
unique
on
its
facts,
and
i
don't
know
that
our
position
here
would
have
any
negative
impact
on
what
we
wanted
to
do
or
what
we...
in
iran.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
true.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes,
but
it
is
very
clear...
it
may
not
be
terribly
clear
what
the
rationale
is,
but
it
is
very
clear
what
the
result
is
here,
but
in
the
context
of
this
case
there
is
no
act
of
state
problem.
