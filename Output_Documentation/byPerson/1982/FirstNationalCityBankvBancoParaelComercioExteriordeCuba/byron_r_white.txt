that
may
be,
but
what
is
the
source
of
the
law
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the...
you
say
courts
around
the
world
find
it
necessary
to
determine
it.
by
what
standard
do
they
decide?
they
look
at
all
the
facts,
but
usually
you
have
to
have
some
rule
that
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
that
may
be,
but
where
do
they
get
those
rules?
do
they
make
them
up,
or
is
it
international
law--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
is
it
federal
law,
or
what?
or
is
it
forum
law?
is
it
the
law
about
forum...
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
law
of
the
forum.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
international
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
international
law
makes
the
law
of
the
forum
state
conclusive?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
error...
what
error
did
the
court
of
appeals
make?
in
the
source
of
the
law,
or
the
standard,
or
just
in
application
of
the
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
only
issue
here
is
sort
of
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
of
whether
on
all
the
facts--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
know,
but
you
said
it
was
primarily
a
factual
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what's
involved
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what...
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
what
the
source
of
the
test
would
be?
i
know
that
you
indicate
that
they
chose
the
wrong
test,
but
where
were
they
reaching
for?
did
they
say--
justice
byron
r.
white
--did
they
think
it
was
a
matter
of
federal
law,
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
is
that
this
is
really
the
cuban
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
were
clear
and
admitted,
there
would
be
no
question
what
the
outcome
of
this
case
should
be.
justice
byron
r.

wholly
aside
from
there
being
a
fund.
