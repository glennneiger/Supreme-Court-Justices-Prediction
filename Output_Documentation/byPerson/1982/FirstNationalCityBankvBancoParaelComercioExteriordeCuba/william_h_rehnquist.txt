justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
harfield,
what
does
that
connote
in
the
practice
of
the
southern
district,
approval
for
filing
by
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
harfield--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
was
just
going
to
make
that
inquiry,
and
i
gather
that
judge
grant
did
find
pretty
much
in
your
favor--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--on
that
point,
but
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
did
not
affirm
his
finding,
did
it?
i
had
some
doubt
as
to
just
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
with
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
significance
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
attached
to
the
fact
that
your
claim
had
not
arisen
out
of
the
same
transaction
as
the
bank's
had?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
krinsky,
i
take
it
that
the
argument
you
are
just
making
is
not
in
your
view...
you
can
accept
all
of
judge
brant's
findings
and
still
say
that
they
don't
bear
on
it
because
you
would
apply
a
different
legal
test
than
he
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
krinsky,
what
corporations
of
the
united
states,
analogous
government
corporations,
would
benefit
in
other
nations
from
the
application
of
the
rule
of
international
law
that
you
describe?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
still
extant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
krinsky,
what
then
is
the
motive
of
your
client
to
continue
to
litigate
this
issue
if
you
are
not
going
to
get
anything
out
of
it
anyway?
