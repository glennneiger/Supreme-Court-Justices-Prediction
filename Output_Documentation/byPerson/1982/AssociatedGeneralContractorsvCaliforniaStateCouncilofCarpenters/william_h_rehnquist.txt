that
does
not
necessarily
mean
we
will
get
it.
oh,
i
see
why
i
did
not
find
it.
it
is
out
of
alphabetical
order
in
your
index.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
watson,
your
reasoning
along
this
line
may
be
quite
persuasive.
but
is
that
not
something
that
ordinarily
would
be
developed
by
evidence,
evidence
of
proximate
cause?
is
it
not
difficult
to
say
just
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint
what
evidence
might
be
adduced
pro
and
con
as
to
how
attenuative
this
effect
was?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
do
get
to
the
standing
issue,
which
i
take
it
is
what
the
present
part
of
your
argument
is
addressed
to,
do
we
not
have
some
difficulty
simply
speculating
as
to
what
evidence
on
proximate
cause
introduced
personally
to
the
complaint
if
it
went
to
trial
would
prove?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
feel
this
is
kind
of
a
rehearing
of
the
connell
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wouldn't
these
people
be
entitled
to
assume,
at
least
for
purposes
of
putting
together
a
policy,
that
generally
your
bids
from
union
contractors
are
going
to
be
higher
than
your
bids
from
nonunion
contractors,
and
therefore
it
is
not
a
nondiscriminate
exclusion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not
so
sure
your
parallel
to
canal
is
as
precise
as
you
would
make
it.
going
back
to
the
case,
that
case
didn't
start
out
as
a
complaint
for
antitrust
damages
under
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
it
started
out
as
a
state
court
action
and
the
union
defended
it
on
the
grounds
of
preemption
by
labor
law.
so
that
the
case
doesn't
speak
at
all
to
the
extent
to
which
a
contractor
could
recover
against
the
union
if
he
had
sued
under
the
antitrust
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
used
connell
talking
about
your
union
having
to
respond
in
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws,
and
of
course,
connell
doesn't
say
that
in
so
many
words.
all
it
says
was
there
was
no
preemption
of
state
law
in
that
case
because
the
antitrust
exemption
to
the
labor
laws
didn't
apply.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
determine
whether
there
was
preemption
or
not.
