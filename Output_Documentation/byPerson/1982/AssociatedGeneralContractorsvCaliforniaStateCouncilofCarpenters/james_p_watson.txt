mr.
james
p.
watson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
allegations
set
forth
in
a
complaint
filed
by
two
regional
labor
organizations
states
a
claim
for
relief
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
for
simplicity
this
morning
i
will
refer
to
these
two
labor
organizations
jointly
as
"the
union".
the
union
alleges
generally
that
it
has
been
a
party
for
over
25
years
to
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
defendant
associated
general
contractors
of
california
and
its
members.
i
shall
refer
to
the
association
this
morning
as
agc>
["],
for
short.
in
paragraph
23
of
its
amended
complaint
the
union
charges
that
agc
and
its
members
entered
into
a
conspiracy
to
undermine,
weaken,
and
destroy
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
between
agc
and
the
union
by
engaging
in
a
series
of
acts
described
in
paragraph
24
of
the
complaint.
the
union
also
alleges
in
the
second
count
of
its
complaint
that
the
same
acts
constituted
breaches
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
between
the
union
and
agc.
agc
filed
motions
to
dismiss
and
for
summary
judgment
in
the
u.s.
district
court.
the
district
court
ordered
the
antitrust
claim
dismissed,
finding
the
union's
claim
was
essentially
a
labor
dispute
for
which
the
union
had
remedies
under
its
collective
bargaining
agreement
through
arbitration
and
potentially
through
the
nlrb.
in
reversing
the
district
court,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
focused
on
two
allegations
set
forth
in
paragraph
24
of
the
complaint,
which
the
ninth
circuit
felt
stated
the
claim
authorizing
the
district
court
to
scrutinize
the
activity
of
agc
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
those
allegations
appear
in
subparagraphs
(3)
and
(4)
of
paragraph
24.
paragraph
24(3)
alleges
that
agc
and
its
members
encouraged
and
induced
others
not
to
sign
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
union.
paragraph
24(4)
alleges
that
agc
and
its
members
encouraged,
aided,
and
coerced
persons
who
let
construction
contracts
to
award
them
to
persons
not
party
to
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
the
union.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
these
allegations
stated
virtually
the
obverse
of
the
situation
treated
by
the
court
in
connell
construction
company
v.
plumbers
and
steamfitters
local
100.
in
the
connell
case
this
court
held
that
an
agreement
between
a
union
and
a
contractor
with
which
the
union
had
no
collective
bargaining
relationship
was
subject
potentially
to
scrutiny
under
the
sherman
antitrust
act.
the
ninth
circuit
apparently
believed
that
the
connell
analysis
would
apply
in
this
case.
we
believe
the
ninth
circuit
is
mistaken
in
that
regard.
we
believe
connell
is
a
far
different
decision.
there
are,
at
a
minimum,
the
following
four
distinctive
features
about
this
case
that
did
not
exist
in
connell:
first,
here,
unlike
connell,
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
relationship
between
the
union
and
the
defendants.
labor
remedies
are
available
under
that
collective
bargaining
agreement.
second,
in
connell,
it
was
clear
the
union
could
not
claim
a
statutory
labor
exemption
under
the
clayton
and
norris-laguardia
acts
because
it
was
combined
with
a
nonlabor
party;
namely,
connell
construction
company.
under
allen
bradley
it
is
clear
the
exemption
is
forfeited
when
a
union
combines
with
a
nonunion
party.
here,
by
contrast,
only
unilateral
activity
on
the
part
of
management
is
involved
and
alleged.
third,
in
connell
it
was
clear
that
the
union
had
the
power
to
shut
any
contractor
out
of
the
market
for
bidding
on
jobs
with
connell
and
any
other
similar
contractor
that
signed
such
an
agreement
with
the
union
simply
by
refusing
to
sign
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
that
company.
if
there
was
no
collective
bargaining
agreement,
then
connell,
under
the
terms
of
its
agreement
with
the
union,
could
not
use
that
company
as
a
subcontractor.
here
there
is
no
allegation
that
agc
has
any
similar
power
to
foreclose
union
companies
from
bidding
on
the
construction
projects
of
letters
of
construction
contracts.
there
is,
therefore,
no
direct
market
restraint
of
the
type
evident
in
connell.
finally,
as
this
court
noted
last
term
in
wolfe
and
romero,
connell
appears
to
be
a
very
limited
holding
which
applied
an
antitrust
remedy
in
a
situation
arising
under
section
8(e)
of
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
of
1959
and
its
additions
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
passed
in
1959,
indicated
no
inclination
on
the
part
of
congress
not
to
permit
application
of
the
antitrust
laws,
the
court
found
scrutiny
of
the
conduct
in
connell
to
be
subject
to
antitrust
analysis.
however,
the
court
was
clear
in
pointing
out
in
that
decision
that
the
earlier
labor
legislation,
the
taft-hartley
act,
did
contain
legislative
statements
indicating
a
desire
not
to
apply
the
antitrust
laws
to
the
broader
proscriptions
contained
in
those
acts.
in
this
case,
the
solicitor
general
argues
that
the
allegations
of
paragraph
24(4)
of
the
complaint
state
the
elements
of
a
classic
boycott
in
the
antitrust
sense.
we
believe
this
reasoning
is
faulty.
first,
it
seems
apparent
that
the
solicitor
general
accepted
the
ninth
circuit's
characterization
of
the
complaint
in
this
case.
and
i
feel
impelled
at
this
point
to
detour
just
for
a
moment
to
comment
on
that
because
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
contains
some
statements
about
what
the
complaint
alleges
which
appear
to
me
to
be
at
variance
with
the
contents
of
the
complaint
itself.
first,
the
ninth
circuit
twice
states
in
its
opinion
that
agc
and
its
members
attempted
to
coerce
letters
of
construction
contracts
to
award
such
contracts
only
to
nonunion
subcontractors.
there
is
no
such
allegation
in
the
complaint.
the
word
"only"
does
not
appear.
nor
could
there
truthfully
be
such
an
allegation,
since
it
would
mean
that
agc
and
its
unionized
members
were
conspiring
to
shut
themselves
out
of
the
market
entirely
on
construction
contracts.
mr.
james
p.
watson
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
james
p.
watson
it
is
in
the
record.
it
is
part
of
the
record
transmitted
to
this
court
by
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
james
p.
watson
oh.
there
is
no
printed
appendix
here.
we
made
a
motion
to
the
court
to
dispense
with
that
since
essentially
it
is--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--that
is
correct.
it
is
appendix
e
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
james
p.
watson
the
second
matter
in
which
we
believe
the
ninth
circuit
has
inaccurately
characterized
the
complaint
is
in
asserting
that
the
complaint
claims
a
boycott.
that
word
also
does
not
appear
in
the
complaint.
but
it
appears
three
times
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
finally,
the
ninth
circuit
asserts
that
there
is
an
effective
lockout
of
union
subcontractors
being
carried
out
here
by
agc
and
agc
is
attempting
to
totally
shut
out
union
subcontractors
from
work
awarded
by
certain
letters
of
construction
contracts.
again,
that
allegation
does
not
appear
anywhere
in
the
complaint.
mr.
james
p.
watson
the
part
i
was
reading
from,
your
honor,
is
paragraph
24,
and
particularly
subparagraphs
(3),
(4),
and
(5).
those
are
the
paragraphs
that
the
ninth
circuit
focused
on.
they
are
in
appendix
e
to
the
petition.
so
we
believe
the
solicitor
general
has
fundamentally
erred
in
the
way
that
it
has
characterized
the
complaint.
second,
the
mere
fact
that
something
which
is
called
a
"boycott"
might
exist
does
not
automatically
turn
every
situation
in
which
such
facts
exist
into
an
antitrust
claim.
at
the
end
of
last
term,
in
naacp
v.
claiborne,
this
court
found
a
noncommercial
boycott
not
be
actionable
under
mississippi
law.
that
concededly
was
not
a
case
which
dealt
with
the
sherman
act.
rather,
mississippi's
antitrust
statute
and
common
law
theories
of
interference
with
contractual
relations
were
involved.
nevertheless,
the
point
seems
clear.
it
is
underscored
by
much
earlier
decision
of
this
court
in
hunt
v.
crumboch,
issued
the
same
year
as
allen
bradley,
1945,
in
which
the
court,
through
mr.
justice
black,
made
it
clear
that
labor
disputes
ordinarily
are
not
the
subject
of
antitrust
scrutiny.
in
that
case,
the
labor
union
refused
to
permit
anyone
to
join
it,
thereby
boycotting
those
people
who
worked
for
a
certain
contractor.
despite
the
fact
that
boycott
analysis
would
ordinarily
apply
to
such
allegations,
the
court
refused
to
find
a
claim
under
the
sherman
act.
recently,
in
an
opinion
which
is
referred
to
with
apparent
approval
by
this
court
in
its
claiborne
decision,
state
of
missouri
v.
national
organization
of
women,
the
eight
circuit
extensively
analyzed
the
legislative
history
of
the
sherman
act
and
concluded
that
the
commercial
types
of
restraints
at
which
the
sherman
act
was
directed
did
not
include
political
types
of
activities.
we
believe
the
same
type
of
analysis
applies
in
this
case,
and
it
is
exemplified,
of
course,
in
the
statutory
exemptions
contained
in
the
clayton
and
norris-laguardia
acts.
the
solicitor
general
states
at
page
9
of
his
brief
that
if
unionized
contractors
do
not
receive
least
some
construction
contracts,
perforce
they
have
been
shut
out
of
a
portion
of
the
market.
and
with
all
respect,
we
believe
this
to
be
circular
reasoning
as
well.
the
test
is
not
whether
unionized
subcontractors
receive
contracts
from
letters
of
construction
contracts,
but
whether
they
were
at
least
considered
for
them.
moreover,
the
fact
that
a
unionized
contractor
may
not
get
all
contracts,
may
only
get
a
portion
of
them,
certainly
does
not
indicate
that
he
is
being
boycotted.
we
also
believe
this
court's
decisions
in
apex
hosiery
v.
leader
and
hunt
v.
crumboch
make
it
clear
that
labor
disputes
are
not
ordinarily
grist
for
the
antitrust
mill.
and
taking
their
lead
from
these
two
decisions,
many
lower
courts
have
followed
that
reasoning
in
recent
years.
in
the
j.b.
stevens
case,
the
prepmore
case,
and
the
kennedy
case,
which
are
all
cited
in
our
brief,
follow
essentially
that
line
of
reasoning
in
refusing
to
permit
labor
unions
to
assert
antitrust
claims
against
employers
and
employers
associations
who
have
acted
antagonistically
against
them,
at
least
where
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
relationship
between
them.
now,
the
solicitor
general
seems
to
agree
that
some
unilateral
employer
conduct
is
exempt
from
scrutiny
under
the
antitrust
laws.
but
he
suggests
the
exemption
is
lost
when
third
parties
are
affected.
and
he
points
out
here
that
there
are
third
parties
in
the
form
of
letters
of
construction
contracts
and
unionized
contractors
not
members
of
agc
who
might
be
affected
by
any
activity
that
the
multi-employer
association
takes.
and
we
think
there
are
three
things
wrong
with
this
analysis:
first,
the
labor
exemption
has
been
applied
time
and
time
again
in
cases
where
third
parties
are
affected.
the
united
states
v.
hutcheson,
the
case
which
applied
the
norris-laguardia
acts,
exemptions
from
the
antitrust
laws
was
a
dispute
between
two
unions,
where,
in
fact,
the
whole
dispute
was
fought
out
on
the
property
of
a
third
party,
anheuser-busch.
the
jacksonville
bulk
terminals,
a
case
decided
by
this
court
last
year,
which
was
a
protest
against
soviet
foreign
policy,
obviously
affected
the
employer
whose
goods
were
not
being
loaded
onto
the
ships
by
the
striking
union.
in
apex
hosiery
there
was
a
violent
sit-down
strike
conducted
by
the
union.
many
parties
were
directly
and
indirectly
affected.
nevertheless,
because
there
was
a
labor
dispute
rather
than
a
dispute
in
a
commercial
context,
this
court
refused
to
apply
the
antitrust
laws.
second,
it
is
an
economic
reality
of
life
that
third
parties
will
be
affected
by
the
unilateral
labor
activity
of
both
management
and
unions.
that
is
inescapable.
and
the
labor
laws
attempt
to
deal
with
that
in
many
ways.
section
8(b)(4)(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
section
303
of
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
provide
remedies
for
certain
limited
kinds
of
impermissible
secondary
conduct.
if
those
remedies
are
inadequate,
the
appropriate
approach
is
to
amend
the
labor
laws,
not
to
try
and
pull
off
from
some
other
branch
of
federal
regulation
into
the
labor
context.
third,
because
of
the
two
unique
mechanisms
available
in
the
construction
industry,
the
issue
of
just
how
much
any
unionized
third
party
might
be
affected
here
is
very
speculative.
this
court
noted
five
years
ago
in
the
higdon
decision
that
a
pre-hire
labor
agreement,
which
is
specifically
authorized
in
the
construction
industry
by
section
8(f)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
is
an
agreement
which
may
be
repudiated
by
a
construction
contractor
at
any
time
before
the
union
demonstrates
majority
representation
in
the
contractor's
work
force.
that
means
that
where
there
has
been
no
such
demonstration,
any
construction
contractor
signed
to
such
a
pre-hire
agreement
can
disavow
the
agreement
and
not
be
bound
by
it
from
that
moment
on.
second,
as
noted
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
chamber
of
commerce,
it
is
a
common
practice
in
this
day
and
age,
and
one
which
in
appropriate
circumstances
passes
legal
muster
before
the
nlrb,
for
contractors
to
create
so-called
double-breasted
businesses;
that
is,
businesses
which
may
consist
of
a
separate
corporation
which
is
union
and
a
separate
corporation
which
is
nonunion.
if
the
same
ownership
exists
of
the
two
businesses,
economic
benefit
flows
to
the
ultimate
owner
regardless
of
whether
contracts
are
performed
by
the
union
or
nonunion
business.
so
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
a
unionized
contractor
is
going
to
be
shut
out
of
the
market
if
an
owner
or
letter
of
construction
contracts
says,
i
want
this
work
performed
nonunion.
interestingly,
respondent
admits
this
in
his
brief
on
page
49,
where
he
states
that
one
reason
the
union
should
bring
this
action
is
because
contractors
may
not
do
so
simply
because
they
may
have
the
option
of
going
double-breasted.
by
saying
that,
it
seems
to
me
the
respondent
has
admitted
there
is
a
very
real
question
here
about
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
approached
this
case.
the
ninth
circuit
said,
we
must
have
an
antitrust
claim
here
because
third
parties
are
affected
and
the
union
can
recover
its
incidental
damages.
the
union
says,
one
reason
we
should
be
permitted
to
do
that
is
because
the
party
against
whom
the
antitrust
conspiracy
is
aimed
may
not
be
damaged
at
all.
we
also
believe
this
case
is
not
properly
maintainable
as
an
antitrust
case
because
the
result
it
seeks
is
not
consonant
with
the
purpose
of
the
antitrust
laws.
in
brunswick
corporation
v.
pueblo
bowl-o-mat
this
court
held
that
antitrust
laws
are
designed
to
protect
competition,
not
competitors.
in
this
case
the
union
seeks
to
collect
damages
stemming
from
a
decline
in
its
power
to
effectively
represent
carpenters
occasioned
by
agc's
encouragement
of
the
proliferation
of
open-shop
contracting.
in
other
words,
as
in
pueblo
bowl-o-mat,
the
plaintiff
wants
nonunion
competitors
out
of
the
market
in
order
to
preserve
the
market
for
unionized
businesses,
unionized
carpenters,
and
ultimately
to
the
benefit
of
the
union
itself.
again
as
the
amici
have
pointed
out,
there
is
much
to
be
said
in
terms
of
preserving
competition
for
permitting
a
market
where
both
union
and
nonunion
contractors
compete
for
construction
contracts.
i
will
not
take
the
time
because
of
the
limitations
of
this
argument
to
discuss
the
application
of
the
statutory
labor
exemption.
that
point
is
briefed
in
detail
in
both
my
brief
and
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
and
the
legislative
history
is
set
forth
there.
i
will
note,
however,
that
last
term,
in
jacksonville
bulk
terminals
this
court
held
again
as
it
has
in
the
past
that
the
term
"labor
dispute"
as
it
is
used
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
has
a
naturally
broad
meaning
and
may
apply
to
disputes
where
third
parties
are
involved
and
may
even
apply
to
disputes
where
motives
other
than
the
economic
motive
are
involved.
mr.
james
p.
watson
i
am
just
coming
to
that,
your
honor.
i
am
glad
you
ask
that
question.
finally,
we
have
the
question
of
standing
in
this
case,
and
the
related
questions
of
jurisprudential
doctrines
developed
by
this
court
and
lower
courts
regarding
who
should
be
permitted
to
maintain
an
antitrust
action
under
the
language
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
last
term,
in
blue
shield
of
virginia
v.
mccready
this
court
addressed
the
standing
issue
under
section
4.
in
granting
standing
to
an
injured
consumer
who
had
been
denied
reimbursement
of
her
billings
by
a
psychologist
for
psychological
services,
the
court
appeared
to
emphasize
three
factors.
one
was
the
need
to
identify
those
who
possess
standing
by
using
proximate
cause
analysis
similar
to
that
used
in
tort
law.
second,
the
court
made
specific
note
of
the
ascertain
ability
of
damages.
in
mccready
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
plaintiff
was
damaged.
it
was
very
easy
to
figure
out
what
the
damages
were.
she
had
the
unpaid
bill,
and
it
showed
right
on
the
bill
how
much
it
was.
third,
the
court
indicated,
as
it
had
previously
in
reiter
v.
sonotone
that
there
was
a
specific
congressional
intent
to
vindicate
consumer
rights
under
the
antitrust
laws.
none
of
these
factors
are
present
in
this
case.
this
is
concededly
not--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--yes,
i
have.
but
i
did
want
to
comment
on
it
because
of
your
honor's
comment
on
mccready.
this
is
not
a
consumers
case.
damages
here,
we
believe,
are
highly
speculative.
they
grow
out
of
the
assumption
that
unionized
workers
will
drop
out
of
their
labor
union
if
they
are
hired
by
an
open-shop
contractor.
and
incidentally,
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
open
shop--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--yes,
i
have.
mr.
james
p.
watson
yes,
i
have.
it's
yellow
in
color,
your
honor.
it
should
be
in
your
packet.
it
was
filed
more
than
a
week
ago.
mr.
james
p.
watson
my
apologies
to
the
court.
mr.
james
p.
watson
if
i
may
just
backtrack
for
a
moment.
the
damages
here
are
far
more
speculative
than
they
are
in
mccready.
the
damage
assumption
rests
on
the
presumption
that
the
union
will
lose
revenues,
lost
dues,
because
members
will
drop
out
if
they
are
hired
by
open-shop
contractors
or
work
shifts
for
the
open-shop
sector
of
the
market.
first,
it
is
by
no
means
clear
that
open-shop
contractors
will
refuse
to
hire
unionized
workers.
in
fact,
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
them
to
inquire
about
the
union
affiliation
of
their
workers.
second,
it
is
by
no
means
clear
that
a
unionized
carpenter
who
goes
to
work
for
an
open-shop
contractor
will
not
maintain
his
union
membership.
work
in
the
construction
industry
is
seasonal.
he
may
well
want
to
go
back
to
work
for
a
unionized
contractor
on
the
next
job
he
gets.
so
it
is
a
matter
of
speculation
to
assume
because
open-shop
contractors
get
some
jobs,
that
there
is
going
to
be
any
massive
shift
of
carpenters
away
from
union
affiliation.
finally,
i
should
note
that
the
proximate
cause
analysis,
which
the
court
adverted
to
in
the
mccready
case,
would
have
to
be
applied
in
this
case
in
a
much
more
attenuated
fashion.
the
union
is
three
or
four
steps,
at
a
minimum,
removed
from
the
situs
of
the
damage.
in
mccready
it
was
very
clear
that
the
consumer
herself
was
extremely
directly
damaged,
and
she
could
not
get
her
medical
bill
paid.
multi-employer
collective
bargaining
has
been
recognized
by
this
court,
most
recently
in
charles
bonanno
linen
but
also
in
buffalo
linen,
to
serve
a
very
real
purpose.
if
the
concerted
acts
of
a
multi-employer
association
and
its
members
in
formulating
labor
policies...
and
those
policies
by
definition
will
always
in
some
sense
be
antagonistic
to
those
of
the
union...
can
be
subject
to
antitrust
analysis
every
time
the
union
is
unhappy
with
those
situations,
then
a
remedy
unanticipated
by
congress
when
it
set
up
the
labor
laws
will
be
injected
in
a
very
delicate
area.
there
are
sensible
reasons
why
unionized
contractors,
including
those
who
want
to
remain
unionized,
would
want
to
encourage
a
certain
amount
of
work
to
go
to
open-shop
contractors,
even
if
it
means
they
lose
that
work.
mr.
james
p.
watson
i
think
your
honor
is
correct
in
the
ordinary
situation.
certainly,
attenuation
is
something
which
can
lead
to
factual
questions
that
need
developed.
and
that
is
why
in
the
case
i
have
taken
the
position
first
that
under
apex
the
court
ought
to
decide
whether
there
is
an
antitrust
case
here
at
all.
second,
if
the
court
decides
there
is
an
antitrust
case,
then
it
should
decide
whether
the
statutory
exemption
applies.
and
only
third,
if
it
decides
the
first
two
questions,
the
first
in
the
affirmative
and
the
second
in
the
negative,
need
it
even
get
to
the
standing
issue.
mr.
james
p.
watson
well,
i
think
in
this
case
the
chain
is
so
long
and
attenuated,
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
me
to
concede
that.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
way
here
the
union
can
recover
from
the
problem
it
would
have.
there
is
just
too
many
separate
links
in
the
chain
for
the
union
to
possibly
show
itself
as
directly
injured.
it
may
not
be
injured
at
all.
and
given
that
circumstance,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
within
the
court's
province
to
say
we
do
not
want
to
put
the
parties
to
the
expense
of
attempting
to
litigate
this.
if
i
understand
the
court's
holding
in
illinois
brick
correctly,
the
holding
amounts
to
a
concern
by
this
court
over
whether
the
expenses
of
litigation
of
attenuated
chains
of
proof
are
going
to
outweigh
any
possible
benefit
either
to
the
litigants
or
the
public.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
problem
here.
that
is
why
in
cases
such
as
this
and
mccready,
which
was
also
a
pleadings
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it
is
clear
from
the
pleadings
that
the
chain
of
causation
is
hopelessly
attenuated,
that
it
is
within
the
court's
province
to
find
that
the
party
does
not
possess
the
requisite
either
standing
or
be
within
that
other
magical
realm
which
is
nonstanding,
which
is
referred
to
in
illinois
brick
of
persons
who
cannot
appropriately
bring
these
actions.
mr.
james
p.
watson
yes.
mr.
james
p.
watson
well,
the
latter
point
is
not
alleged
in
the
complaint
but--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--i
am
specifically
not
contending
that
the
problem
is
that
the
pleading
is
not
specific
enough.
it
seems
to
me
under
the
mcclain
case
that
this
court
has--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--none
of
them
would
do
business
with
nonunion?
no,
i
think--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--with
union.
mr.
james
p.
watson
no,
i
think
it
would
not,
under
the
doctrines
that
i
have
enunciated.
it
might
give
rise
to
labor
law
violations.
there
might
be
problems
arising.
the
union
has
alleged,
remember,
the
second
count
of
the
complaint--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--that
is
exactly
right.
i
would
still
say
that
this
is
essentially
a
labor
dispute
and
that
a
multi-employer
association
and
its
members
have
to
have
the
power
to
formulate
some
type
of
unified
labor
policy.
and
in
fact,
the
norris-laguardia
act
says,
in
so
many
words,
that
it
shall
not
be
an
enjoinable
act
to
encourage
or
induce
or
suggest
to
others
that
they
not
deal
with
a
specific
other
party.
so,
yes,
i
would
think
that
is
clearly
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
james
p.
watson
well,
there
are
several
different
kinds,
depending
on
which
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
one
is
focusing
on
the
so-called
double-breasted
businesses
are
frequently
attacked
by
the
union
as
a
refusal
to
bargain
under
section
8(a)(5)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
james
p.
watson
that
is
right.
and
there
are
even
broader
remedies
under
the
labor
agreement
itself.
as
this
court
knows
from
the
steel
workers
trilogy,
when
you
have
a
collective
bargaining
relationship,
there
is
an
implied
covenant
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealings.
and
a
unified
action
by
the
members
of
the
multi-employer
bargaining
unit
to
subvert
that
covenant
of
good
faith,
i
think,
is
clearly
arbitrable,
and
perhaps
the
subject
of
a
301
suit
as
well.
and
there
are
lower
court
cases
that
have
held
as
much,
where
a
301
suit
has
been
brought
and
there
is
no
specific
violation
of
any
specific
point
in
the
labor
contract,
but
as
in
lucas
flour,
in
reading
the
labor
contract,
one
can
say,
this
employer
has
not
really
kept
good
faith
with
the
union.
so
there
are
both
contractual
and
board
remedies,
we
believe.
thank
you.
mr.
james
p.
watson
just
one.
mr.
james
p.
watson
thank
you.
or
really
i
should
say
two
things.
first,
if
i
might
just
briefly,
counsel
had
indicated
that
there
was
no
adequate
remedy
under
the
labor
laws
for
the
kind
of
double-breasted
problem
that
occurs
when
a
contractor
opens
an
open
shop
and
maintains
a
union
shop
business
at
the
same
time.
in
fact,
there
is
a
whole
string
of
nlrb
cases
on
this
subject.
they
are
on
pages
66
and
67
of
the
record
transmitted
to
this
court
by
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals,
cases
such
as
shultz
painting,
which
is
at
202
nlrb
no.
23;
milo
express
at
212
nlrb
no.
57,
and
so
forth.
second,
in
the
time
remaining
let
me
comment
on
connell
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
whole
thrust
of
the
plaintiff's
contention
here
is
that
connell
mandates
this
kind
of
action.
first,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
opening
argument,
there
was
a
mechanism
in
connell
which
is
absent
here,
and
that
was
the
power
of
the
union
to
literally
lock
contractors
out
of
the
market
with
connell
and
any
other
stranger
contractor
it
could
get
to
sign
one
of
these
agreements
with
it
that
they
would
not
subcontract
to
anyone
not
party
to
an
agreement
with
the
union.
here
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
complaint,
no
mechanism
alleged
that
would
lead
to
any
inference
that
agc
has
such
a
power.
second,
the
court
specifically
emphasized
in
connell
that
it
was
engaging
in
a
rather
narrow
exception
to
the
general
rule
about
preemption
by
the
labor
laws
of
antitrust
claims.
specifically,
the
court
relied
on
the
fact
that
when
section
8(e)
was
enacted
in
1959
there
was
no
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
congress
wanted
8(e)
violations
not
to
be
redressed
under
the
antitrust
laws.
the
court
made
specific
reference
at
that
time
to
the
fact
that
the
opposite
was
the
case
with
regard
to
the
taft-hartley
act.
now,
it
seems
to
me
as
discussed
in
my
opening
argument
connell
is
clearly
distinguishable.
finally,
finally
in
connell
the
court
says
in
a
footnote
that
where
a
party
has
two
consistent
remedies
under
federal
law,
he
may
have
a
choice
of
remedies.
now,
whether
the
court
in
fact
in
connell
considered
whether
the
remedies
were
consistent
or
not,
it
is
clear
here,
i
think,
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
my
brief
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
are
the
remedies
consistent
between
arbitration
grievance
processing,
nlrb
grievance
processing...
both
of
which
are
basically
make
whole
type
remedies...
and
the
type
of
remedy
which
would
be
available
in
an
antitrust
action
where
treble
damages
and
attorneys'
fees
would
come
down
on
the
heads
of
all
the
losing
defendants.
so
for
those
reasons
i
don't
think
connell
creates
authority
for
this
kind
of
action.
finally,
i
would
urge
the
court
to
read
the
complaint
carefully.
we
are
here
only
to
test
the
allegations
of
this
complaint,
not
matters
outside
the
complaint.
and
there
have
been
some
statements
made
in
counsel's
argument,
specifically
statements
about
conspiracies
with
letters
of
contracts
as
opposed
to
conspiracies
among
the
membership
to
encourage
and
induce
letters
of
contracts
which
do
not
appear
in
the
complaint.
i
am
not
contending
that
it
would
not
be
possible
for
mr.
van
bourg
or
his
clients
to
concoct
some
kind
of
potential
antitrust
theory.
what
i
do
contend
is
that
this
complaint
by
its
words
does
not
state
an
antitrust
claim.
it
is
purely
and
simply
a
labor
grievance.
i
thank
you.
