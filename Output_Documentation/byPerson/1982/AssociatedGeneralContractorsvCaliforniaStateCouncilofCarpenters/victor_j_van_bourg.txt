mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
guess
we
have
to
start
with
the
basic
premise
of
whether
or
not
this
an
antitrust
case
or
a
labor
case.
that
was
addressed
by
the
court
below.
it
treated
the
case
as
an
antitrust
case
and
not
as
a
labor
case.
and
the
reason
that
it
treated--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--surely.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
no
very
readily,
your
honor.
my
colleague
said--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--as
an
8(a)(5),
as
an
8(a)(5),
assuming
that
the
contractor
has
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
relationship
with
the
union
and
then
seeks
to
avoid
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
by
developing
a
sham
entity
or
a
double-breast,
as
we
refer
to
it,
and
that
we
file
a
charge
under
section
8(a)(5)
to
allege,
in
essence,
an
attempt
to
run
away
from
an
agreement,
a
runaway
shop.
as
a
theoretical
matter,
yes,
that
could
be
done
on
a
contractor-by-contractor
basis.
as
a
practical
matter,
it
simply
is
not
done
because
the
board
has
said
that
that
is
really
not
a
remedy
for
a
double-breast.
and
in
essence,
if
one
deals
with
the
reality
of
the
work
place,
what
happens
is
that
a
contractor,
particularly
when
viewed
in
the
context
of
this
court's
decision
in
higdon
changes
his
name
or
its
name
for
every
job,
sometimes
changes
his
name
or
entity
or
style
of
doing
business
on
various
sections
of
the
same
job
and
joins
an
association,
becomes
signatory
to
the
contract,
the
day
after
the
contract
is
signed,
moves
over
to
the
so-called
open-shop
division
of
that
association
and
becomes
free
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
because
of
the
notion,
specifically
discussed
by
this
court
in
connell,
that
there
is
a
statutory
scheme
that
there
should
be
no
top-down
organizing.
so
even
if
we
want
to
deal
with
the
reality
of
what
this
court
dealt
with
in
connell,
the
answer,
your
honor,
to
the
question
posed
was
that
there
is
no
practical
remedy
under
8(a)(5).
that
is
why
it
is
essential
that
this
court
understand
the
distinction
posed
by
the
court
below
in
treating
this
as
an
antitrust
case
and
not
as
a
labor
case
in
my
standing
here
before
you
and
arguing
this
to
be
an
antitrust
case
and
not
a
labor
case
when
i
would
dearly
love
to
argue
with
you
concerning
the
policy
questions
of
connell.
but
for
purposes
of
this
case,
it
has
to
be
accepted
and
understood
that
we
are
dealing
indeed
with
the
obverse
of
connell.
this
is
not
a
labor
case.
the
only
way
in
which
petitioner
can
prevail
is
to
place
this
case
in
the
context
of
a
labor
case
and
have
this
court
agree
that
it
is
a
labor
case
and
not
an
antitrust
case.
so
let's
look
at
the
two
beacon
lights
which
this
court
focused
in
connell.
number
one,
it
said,
even
though
counsel
states
that
it
is
to
be
narrowly
construed...
that
is,
connell...
this
court
states
that
there
must
be
a
stranger
relationship.
local
100
signed
an
agreement
with
connell
after
putting
economic
pressure
on
connell
at
a
time
when
it
thought
that
it
was
protected
by
section
8(e)
of
the
act
in
doing
what
it
did.
but
assuming
it
was
not,
assuming
the
conduct
was
proscribed
by
section
8(b)(4),
regulated
by
taft-hartley,
subject
to
the
filing
of
a
charge
under
section
8(b)(4),
subject
after
a
hearing
before
the
board
to
a
collateral
estoppel
argument
in
a
damage
action
under
section
3,
subject
to
a
303
action
for
what
it
did,
what
local
100
did,
notwithstanding
a
regulatory
statutory
scheme,
notwithstanding
a
statutory
provision
that
says
that
you
can
get
damages
for
such
conduct,
which
is
8(b)(4),
secondary-boycott
conduct,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
after
the
passage
of
norris-laguardia,
congress
gave
united
states
district
courts
the
authority
under
section
10(1)
for
that
same
conduct,
to
obtain
an
injunction
against
the
proscribed
conduct,
pendente
lite.
so
a
full
and
comprehensive
scheme
of
regulation
damages
and
injunctive
relief,
this
court
still
held
that
even
though
it
was
clear-cut
8(b)(4),
10(1),
303
action,
we
shine
the
light
on,
the
beacon
on,
the
fact
that
in
addition
to
being
proscribed
by
taft-hartley,
you
local
100
committed
a
violation
of
antitrust,
subjecting
you
to
treble
damages.
standing
was
not
even
argued
in
that
case.
it
was
assumed.
and
it
was
assumed
because
of
a
built-in
prejudice
in
the
kind
of
plaintiff
we
have:
if
it
is
an
employer,
the
damages
are
assumed
not
to
be
speculative;
if
it
is
a
union,
it
is
assumed
to
be
speculative.
what
was
the
second
beacon
light
of
this
court
in
connell?
it
was,
in
fact,
that
the
action,
the
conduct
of
local
100
was
designed
to
prohibit
the
employment
of
nonunion
contractors,
which
this
court
stated
was
exclusionary
on
a
nondiscriminatory
basis
and,
therefore,
anticompetitive,
i.e.,
if
you
have
two
nonunion
contractors
and
one
of
them
is
efficient
and
one
of
them
is
inefficient,
and
you
exclude
them
both,
including
the
efficient
one,
this
court
stated
that
that
nondiscriminate
exclusion
regardless
of
efficiency,
which
incidentally
was
outside
the
record
of
that
case,
constituted
the
second
beacon
light.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
absolutely
not.
i
stand
here
arguing
in
support
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
and,
therefore,
in
support
of
your
decision
in
connell,
and
asking
that
reality
focus
on
exactly
the
obverse.
what
do
we
have
in
this
case?
we
have
a
stranger
relationship.
the
question
was
asked,
and
counsel
stated
that
all
of
the
parties
are
reachable
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
is
absolutely
not
correct.
the
owner
of
land,
the
major
industrialist,
the
member
of
the
roundtable
who
determines
that
there
should
be
a
"union-free
environment",
says
that
when
i
build
my
plant,
when
i
build
my
refinery,
when
i
build
my
chemical
factory,
you
contractor
will
be
nonunion
and
you
will
see
to
it
that
you
and
your
other
contractors
who
do
work
on
this
project
will
be
nonunion,
and
we
form
a
tripartite
conspiracy.
a
tripartite
conspiracy
to
do
what?
again,
the
connell
beacon
light
shines
and
finds
what?
to
exclude
on
a
nondiscriminate
basis,
regardless
of
efficiency
or
nonefficiency,
all
of
those
contractors
who
have
a
union
contract.
if
you
could
find
that
it
was
an
antitrust
case
in
connell
because
of
those
two
beacon
lights,
stranger
and
nondiscriminate
exclusion,
you
cannot
avoid
the
conclusion
here,
because
without
regard
to
whether
the
contractor
is
the
single
lowest
bidder,
the
single
most
efficient
contractor
on
the
whole
project,
because
he
has
or
it
has
a
collective
bargaining
relationship
with
the
union,
it
is
therefore
excluded
under
what
we
have
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
i
do
not
think
so.
number
one,
your
honor,
i
think
you
would
have
to
presume
the
facts
to
be
tried
at
a
trial.
we
are
here
on
the
pleadings
and
the
facts
pleaded
therefore
have
to
be
assumed
to
be
correct.
but
quite
the
contrary
happens
everyday
in
the
real
world;
that
is,
that
the
union
contractor,
precisely
because
he
has
highly
skilled
workers,
they
are
more
efficient.
they
may
get
a
higher
hourly
wage
rate
than
a
nonunion
contractor,
but
he
will
do
the
job
cheaper
and
he
will
do
it
more
efficiently.
and
day
by
day
all
over
the
country,
particularly
in
our
area,
the
low
bidder
in
the
field
of
contractors,
union
and
nonunion,
are
union
contractors.
so
that
assumption,
in
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
is
not
one
that
can
be
assumed
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
or
as
a
matter
of
reality.
now,
to
continue
with
the
aspect
of
why
we
feel
connell
requires
a
decision
in
our
favor
in
this
case,
and
why
the
ninth
circuit
used
connell
as
the
sole
basis
of
its
decision,
is
that
this
court
did
something
brand-new
in
a
sense
in
connell.
previously...
and
this
directly
contradicts
petitioner's
attempt
to
make
it
into
a
labor
case...
previously,
at
least
since
1947,
since
the
taft-hartley
amendments,
the
proviso
requiring
federal
preemption,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
garman,
guss
and
fairlong,
and
garner,
was
specifically
held
to
apply
to
antitrust
cases.
this
court's
decision
in
teamsters
v.
oliver
dealt
with
the
ohio
antitrust
statute.
this
court
held
that
taft-hartley
preempts
any
remedy,
injunctive
or
by
way
of
damages
in
an
antitrust
action
in
that
case.
in
connell
you
specifically
dealt
with
that
issue.
you
referred
to
oliver,
as
i
recall,
in
the
text
towards
the
end
of
the
decision
and
also
in
a
footnote,
and
stated,
very
simply,
that
it
is
true
that
in
the
antitrust
statute
alleged
in
connell,
if
we
can
recall,
that
case
was
originally
filed
under
the
texas
antitrust
statute,
was
removed
to
the
united
states
district
court.
an
amendment
to
the
complaint
stated
a
claim
under
the
sherman
act.
this
court
held
that
taft-hartley
preempts
the
field
with
respect
to
the
state
law,
does
not
preempt
with
respect
to
the
federal
law,
and
required
this
court
to
balance
the
competing
interests
between
the
sherman
and
clayton
antitrust
acts
and
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947,
as
amended.
and
i
specifically
state
it
that
way
and
characterize
it
that
way
because
the
connell
conduct
would
have
been
lawful
and
fully
protected
by
section
7
of
the
waggoner
act,
still
section
7
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
because
section
8(b),
declaring
the
conduct
of
secondary
boycott
and
indeed
the
type
of
conduct
as
we
had
in
hutchinson
a
jurisdictional
dispute,
was
protected
activity
or
at
least
not
prohibited
until
1947;
that
is,
the
for
the
twelve-year
period
between
1935
and
1947.
so
we
have
a
situation
where
this
court
decided
in
connell
that
we
will
balance
the
competing
interests
between
the
antitrust
laws
of
the
united
states
and
the
labor
laws
of
the
united
states.
and
therefore,
it
cannot
be
escaped
that
the
reasonable
conclusion
is
here
that
if
those
competing
interests
are
to
be
balanced,
both
sides
of
the
coin
must
receive
the
equal
balance.
if
a
union
can
be
a
defendant
in
a
treble-damage
action
in
an
antitrust
setting
and
context,
and
if
you
deny
the
relief
the
ninth
circuit
gave
to
us
in
this
case,
you
are
saying,
defendant
you
shall
be
but
never
a
plaintiff
because
you
are
a
union.
now,
many
such
distinctions
are
made,
and
throughout
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
lower
courts--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--all
right,
now
we
get
to
the
standing
issue--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--which
i
really
feel
is
the
crux
of
the
case.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
having
overcome,
if
i
can,
for
purposes
of
argument,
the
antitrust
portion--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--the
antitrust
context
of
the
matter.
again,
counsel
argues
and
the
government
argues
in
their
brief,
the
government
says,
statutory
exemption
does
not
protect
the
petitioner,
nonstatutory
exemption
does
not
protect
petitioner,
the
issue
of
the
labor
laws
preempting
this
particular
subject
matter
does
not
protect
petitioner.
the
government
says,
yes,
they
have
stated
a
cause
of
action
and
a
claim
for
antitrust.
they
did
mischaracterize
our
pleadings.
then
the
government
states,
very
simply,
that
the
reason
we
do
not
have
standing
is
because
the
damages
are
speculative
and
because
they
are
remote.
and
counsel
and
respondent...
petitioners
argue
very
heavily
that
there
are
several
links
in
the
chain
between
the
direct
proximate
causation
and
the
damages.
my
response,
your
honor,
is
to...
again,
because
when
arguing
statutes
very
often
one
forgets
the
exact
text...
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
says
any
person...
the
union
is
a
person...
who
shall
be
injured
in
his
business
or
property...
i
suppose
we
better
change
that
to
"its
or
his
or
hers"...
by
reason
of
anything
forbidden
in
the
antitrust
laws...
we
have
already
gone
over
the
bridge
that
this
is
an
antitrust
case...
may
sue,
therefore,
in
any
district
court
in
which
the
defendant
resides
or
is
found
or
has
an
agent,
without
respect
to
the
amount
in
controversy.
statutory
language
for
a
specific
reason.
now,
i
do
not
have
to
stand
here
and
say
that
this
union,
which
represents
in
excess
of
110,000
members,
has
a
speculative
damage
claim.
do
we
have
to
play
fairy
tales
to
understand
that
the
statistics
of
the
country
are
that
only
20
percent
of
the
work
force
is
unionized
and
that
if
this
kind
of
a
conspiracy
succeeds
and
has
absolutely
no
practical
remedial
force
against
it,
that
it
would
be
less
than
20
percent,
and
in
the
construction
industry,
which
is
a
target,
that
the
union
will
be
damaged
directly?
and
not
just
dues;
this
is
not
a
cash
register
issue.
but
that
is
direct;
that
is
not
many
links
in
the
chain.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
i
think
employees
might
have
standing.
we
deliberately,
i
must
state,
in
the
original
galley
of
our
brief,
we
dealt
with
the
case
that
dealt
with
the
hiring
hall
issue.
we
deliberately
decided
not
to
use
that
case
here
in
this
context
because
this
is
not
a
derivative
action.
we
do
not
want
to
fall
in
the
trap
of
hawaii
v.
chevron.
we
do
not
want
to
fall
in
the
trap
of
illinois
brick.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
i
am
not
so
sure
that
i
could
say
that
it
is
less,
less
direct.
but
let's
say
for
a
moment
that
it
is
less
direct.
that
was
the
damage
to
the
worker.
what
is
the
damage
to
the
worker
if
he
no
longer
can
find
a
job
with
a
union
contractor
because
the
conspiracy
has
been
successful
and
has
made
all
contractors
nonunion?
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
he
would
have
lower
wages.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
or
no
wages
at
all.
no
job.
certainly
nobody
agreed
to
use
the
hiring
halls
so
we
would
have
to
have
a
tougher
time
getting
a
job.
but
that
would
be
his
damage.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
the
union
has
its
own
damages
and
institution.
not
every
institution--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--i
would
say
that
if
we
again
take
a
look
at
the
text
of
the
clayton
act
and
deal
with
the
absolutely--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--that
is
right.
if
we
deal
with
the
basic
concepts--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--well,
but
what
about
the
contract,
your
honor?
we
have
held
dearly
since
the
framing
of
the
constitution
that
one
of
the
sacred
property
rights
of
the
nation
is
to
permit
its
citizens
freely
to
enter
into
contractual
obligations
and
conspiracies
which
either
affect
or
destroy
those
contractual
relationships
directly
injure
the
contractual
parties.
the
union
has
a
direct
first-step
injury
if
this
conspiracy
succeeds.
the
laws
of
the
united
states
are
that
under
the
grievance
procedure
the
worker
does
not
own
the
grievance,
the
union
owns
the
grievance.
the
union
is
the
collective
bargaining
party,
is
the
owner
of
the
contract.
the
worker
is
the
beneficiary.
and
there
all
of
a
sudden
mccready
comes
down.
if
mccready
can
be
granted
standing
to
protect
the
psychologists--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--yes.
the
union--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--as
the
collective
bargaining
agent
for
the
employees--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--the
grievance
is
owned
by
the
union,
not
by
the
worker.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
that
means--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--no,
no.
what
that
means
is
that
the
union
and
the
worker
may
have
a
competing
interest
in
processing
the
grievance.
mr.
victor
j.
van

the
westinghouse
case--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--that's
correct.
this
course
is
open--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--well,
let
me
put
it
in
another
context.
the
worker
has
a
right
to
self-representation,
but
not
in
an
adverse
position
to
the
union,
because
a
worker
cannot
cut
his
own
deal
because
that
would
destroy
the
wages,
hours,
and
condition,
which
are
owned
collectively...
that
is
why
we
call
it
a
collective
bargaining
agreement...
by
all
of
the
employees
in
the
collective
bargaining
unit.
that
is
why
there
must
be
a
distinction
made
between
the
interests
of
the
institution,
direct
injury
to
the
institution,
versus
the
direct
injury
to
the
member.
the
member
may
have
a
separate
and
distinct
and
sometimes
competing
interest
with
respect
to
the
union.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
no.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
the
worker
gets
it,
vindicating
the
collect...
although
the
worker
gets
it
in
his
pocket,
it
vindicates
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
all
the
other
workers.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
i
agree,
your
honor,
but
i
was
answering
the
question.
i
would
like
to
go
one
point
further
and
talk
about
mccready.
let's
take
the
context
of
this
case
and
remember
where
it
came
from,
because
it
started
in
1975.
this
is
the
second
1975
case
you
have
this
morning.
in
19...
this
case
was
filed
before
connell.
during
its
pendency
before
the
united
states
district
court
connell
came
down.
we
were
asked
to
brief
connell.
the
district
judge
then
found
that
connell
was
inapplicable.
it
was
appealed
on
that
ground
to
the
ninth
circuit.
it's
as
much
a
mystery
to
me
as
to
everybody
else
why
it
took
so
long
to
proceed,
but
it
did.
it
was
eventually
calendared
and
heard,
and
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed,
and
the
decision
on
rehearing
clarifies
the
opinion.
and
what
we
are
here
arguing
is
is
that
there
is
a
direct
opposite,
that
there
are
two
faces
to
the
coin;
that
if
connell
stands,
which
it
must
because
no
one
in
this
case
has
asked
that
it
be
reversed,
and
no
one
in
this
case
has
tackled
the
policy
arguments
of
connell.
we
did
not
raise
higdon;
counsel
raised
higdon.
higdon
and
connell
taken
together
with
the
1959
amendments
to
taft-hartley...
that
is,
title
vii
of
the
landram-griffin
act...
place
us
in
a
totally
different
position
from
that
in
which
we
have
been
before
as
labor
organizations.
if
we
can
be
sued
and
pay
out
of
our
treasury
when
the
connell
beacon
shines
on
us,
but
we
have
no
standing
because
we
have
no
property
or
the
link
in
the
chain
is
too
remote
for
us,
therefore,
to
be
plaintiffs,
and
we
can
never
on
the
exact
observe,
on
the
exact
reverse,
on
the
exact
same
fact
situation,
but
here
the
contractors
are
the
defendants,
and
we're
the
plaintiffs
versus
the
connell
situation.
if
we
do
not
have
a
remedy,
you
have
not
carried
forward
the
purpose
which
you
stated
you
were
carrying
forward
in
connell.
you
justified
connell...
connell
was
a
departure...
you
justified
connell
on
the
basis
that
you
were
balancing
the
interests
between
labor
laws
and
antitrust
laws
in
that
area
where
they
meshed
and
where
the
ground
was
soft.
therefore,
if
you
are
balancing,
you
must
balance
equally.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
that's
how
i
must
interpret
the
complaint
because
that's
how
the
ninth
circuit
interpreted
the
complaint.
in
applying
its
target
set...
test,
it
stated
the
union
was
the
target,
it
was
aimed
at
and
was
hit.
and
the
way
in
which
the
union
was
the
target
and
was
aimed
at
and
was
hit
was
through
a
conspiracy
to
restrain
trade
on
a
non-discriminate
basis
to
make
it
clear
that
if
you
have
a
contractual
relationship
with
a
union
you
will
not
work
on
these
projects.
and
it
is
absolutely
incorrect
to
say
that
this
happened
in
a
labor
context.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
i
would
say
that
mccready
is
right
on
point.
and
to
say
that
mccready
didn't
suffer
a
competitive
injury,
and
we
didn't
suffer
a
competitive
injury,
i
think
is
not
exactly
on
point,
although
because
i
am
seeking
the
support
of
mccready
i
would
have
to
say
yes.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
certainly
no
competitive
interest.
but
what
is
the
derivative
benefit
of
the
mccready
case?
the
derivative
benefit,
again,
the
practical
reality
in
which
this
court's
decision
will
be
applied
in
blue
shield,
mccready,
will
be
that
blue
shield
will
incorporate
the
clinical
psychologists
as
part
of
its
benefit
plan
without
it
being
blessed
first
by
a
psychiatrist.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
your
honor,
i
stated
precisely
that.
i
stated
that
in
connell
the
suit
was
filed
first
alleging
a
violation
of
the
state
antitrust
law,
the
same
as
was
the
case
in
oliver.
it
was
then
removed
to
the
united
states
district
court,
and
the
plaintiff
amended
his
complaint
to
add
a
cause
of
action
of
a
violation
of
sherman.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
well,
your
honor,
in
all
due
respect
i
think
connell
says
that
what
local
100
did
in
that
case,
notwithstanding
it
being
cognizable
by
section
8(b)(4),
section
10(l),
and
section
303
of
taft-hartley
was
also
cognizable
by
the
antitrust
laws
and
was
remanded
back
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
further
findings.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
that's
not
how
i
read
connell,
and
i
don't
think
that
that's
how
it's
read
generally.
connell
is
read
generally
in
the
labor
bar
and
in
the
antitrust
bar
as
subjecting
a
stranger
union,
stranger
union,
beacon
1,
to
antitrust
liability
for
conduct
otherwise
either
arguably
protected
or
prohibited...
that's
the
language
of
garman,
of
this
court...
subjecting
it
to
antitrust
liability
if
it
is
a
stranger,
and
we
have
strangers
here,
and
if
it
its
ultimate
conduct
is
to
nondiscriminately
exclude
without
regard
to
efficiency
or
other
reasonable
criteria
a
group
of
employers
from
the
market...
precisely
the
case
that
we
have
here.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
yes--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--yes.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
your
honor,
we
have
alleged
that
they
have
entered
into
a
conspiracy
with
owners,
with
general
contractors,
with
their
own
membership,
because
remember,
the
agc,
and
we
allege
in
the
complaint,
has
both
union
and
an
open
shop
division.
in
the
context
of
that
it
is
part
of
its
general
program
to
see
to
it
that
notwithstanding
the
existence
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
that
those
contractors
with
collective
bargaining
agreements
do
not
work
because
its
own
membership
has
a
significant
nonunion
branch
and
can
easily
simply
opt
over.
and
this
is
a
step
in
that
process.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
well,
as
i
understand
what
he
was
arguing
was
that
that
was
subject
to
an
8(a)(5)
remedy.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
yes.
we
have
described...
in
part
of
our
complaint
we
have
mentioned
that
part
and
parcel
of
the
action...
we
alleged
many
other
things
in
addition
to
antitrust
violations...
was
the
attempt
to
avoid
the
contract
by
the
development
of
what
is
lawfully
permitted
under
the
so-called
double-breasted--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--we
drafted
the
whole
complaint,
and
i
think
paragraph
3,
4,
5
and
6--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--that's
correct.
they
opened
an
open
shop
division.
it
was
in
the
context
of
this.
i'm
looking
for
that
portion
of
the
index
which
has
section...
paragraph
24.
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
complaint--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
--all
right.
the
actual
language
is
on
page
18:
"advocated,
induced,
coerced,
encouraged
and
aided
members
of
the
agc
of
california,
non-members
of
agc
of
california,
and
memorandum
contractors
to
enter
into
subcontracting
agreements
with
subcontractors
who
are
not
signatories
to
any
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
the
plaintiffs
in
each
of
them.
"
and
i
think
it's
important
that
at
this
stage
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
is
i
don't
think
a
viable
argument.
i
think
we
have
to
deal
with
the
guts
of
the
issue
which
is
the
standing
issue.
