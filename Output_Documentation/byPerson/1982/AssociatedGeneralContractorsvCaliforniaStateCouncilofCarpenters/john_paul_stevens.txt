it
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
watson,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
you
suggest
that
the
first
issue
we
should
address
is
whether
there
is
an
antitrust
violation
and
postpone
consideration
of
standing
until
we
have
answered
that
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
in
your
argument
on
the
antitrust
violation,
are
you
relying
primarily
on
the
fact
that
the
pleading
is
not
sufficiently
specific
because
it
just
says
coerce,
or
are
you
contending
that
if
all
of
the
members
of
the
association
did,
in
fact,
agree
that
none
of
them
would
do
business
with
a
nonunion
contractor,
that
that
agreement
would
not
violate
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
what
i
am
asking
you.
are
you
basically
making
an
argument
directed
at
the
way
in
which
the
pleading
is
framed,
or
are
you
questioning
what
i
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
let
me
rephrase
my
question.
supposing
that
the
pleading
specifically
said,
all
of
the
members
of
the
association
have
agreed
with
one
another
in
writing
that
none
of
them
will
do
business
with
nonunion
contractors
or
subcontractors.
would
that
state
an
antitrust
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
union.
i
stated
it
backwards.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
if
the
complainant
excluded
the
words
"boycott"
in
so
many
words,
you
would
still
say
that
is
not
the
kind
of
boycott
which
the
sherman
act
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
about
the
one
link
in
the
chain?
what
about
employees
of
a
union
contractor
or
subcontractor,
would
they
have
standing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no;
but
is
it
not
true
that,
just
focusing
on
one
union
employer
for
the
moment,
is
it
not
true
that
the
impact
on
the
union
is
less
direct
than
the
impact
on
the
employees
who
pay
the
union
dues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
would
say
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
no
wages
at
all,
possibly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
union
could
not
be
damaged
unless
its
members
were
first
damaged.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
they
are
covered
literally.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
are
the
employees
and
so
are
the
customers
and
the
suppliers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
confess
i
am
puzzled.
you
say
the
union
owns
the
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
it
was
an
agent
for
its
members.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
owned?
but
what
does
that
mean?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
mean
that
if
there
is
a
dollar
recovery,
the
union
can
pocket
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
union
has
ability
to
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--for
good
faith
in
representing
the
worker.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not
own
the
claim.
i
certainly
cannot
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
one
more
question,
if
i
may,
about
the
specific
conspiracy
that
you've
alleged
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--your
complaint.
your
defendants
here,
as
i
understand
it,
are
an
association
of
general
contractors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
do
not
allege,
as
i
read
the
complaint,
that
the
members
of
the
association
have
refused
to
do
business
with
union
subcontractors.
you
rather
have
alleged
that
they
have
encouraged
landowners
and
builders
and
so
forth
to
employ
nonunion
contractors.
do
i
read
it
correctly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
describe
what
your
opponent
referred
to
as
the
double-breasted
situation
in
the
complaint?
i
didn't
catch
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
answer
my
question.
is
that
part
of
your
complaint,
a
description
of
that
kind
of
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
government
seems
to
focus
and
everyone
seems
to
focus
on
subparagraph
3
and
4
of
paragraph
24
of
the
complaint.
do
you
agree
that's
the
crux
of...
those
are
the
critical
paragraphs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case
that
i
have
to
announce
is
associated
general
contractors
of
california
against
california
state
council
of
carpenters
and
others.
the
case
arises
out
of
a
dispute
between
parties
to
a
multiemployer
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
plaintiff
unions
alleged
that
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
the
mutliemployer
association
and
its
members
coerced
certain
third
parties
as
well
as
some
of
the
association's
members
to
enter
into
a
business
relationship
with
nonunion
firms.
this
coercion
according
to
the
complaint
adversely
affected
the
trade
of
certain
unionized
firms
and
thereby
in
turn,
restrained
the
business
activities
of
the
unions.
the
unions
filed
suit
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california,
alleging
that
they
have
been
injured
by
conduct
in
violation
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
the
union's
compliant
sufficiently
alleged
that
they
were
parties
who
have
been
injured
in
their
business
or
property
by
reason
of
anything
forbidden
in
the
antirust
laws
and
may
therefore
recovered
treble
damages
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
for
reasons
stated
at
length
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
conclude
that
the
union's
action
may
not
be
maintained
under
this
statute.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
