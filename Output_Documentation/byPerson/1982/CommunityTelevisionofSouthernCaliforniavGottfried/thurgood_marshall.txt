mr.
firestone--
--what--
--go
ahead.
my
only
question
was,
i
thought
we
might
clarify,
if
you
would
give
me
your
idea
of
what
the
fcc
has
to
do
to
comply
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
would
they
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
we
get
beyond
supposing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
you
want
is
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
all
you
want?
so
far.

what
do
you
want
beyond
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
get
the
guidelines
on
a
hearing
involving
one
station?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
rulemaking
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you've
got
a
ruling.
you
want
an
adjudication
first
as
to
whether
this
license
can
be
renewed.
that
is
what
you
asked
for.
mr.
firestone,
do
you
think--
--where
did
you
ask
for
a
license
to
be
renewed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
you
ask
for
relief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
none
of
that
is
here.
