mr.
charles
m.
firestone
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
represent
sue
gottfried
and
the
greater
los
angeles
council
on
deafness,
who
in
turn
represent
the
estimated
five
and
a
half
to
eighteen
million
severely
hearing
impaired
people
who
have
been
subject
to
a
history
of
discrimination
generally
and
largely
excluded
from
participation
in
and
denied
the
benefits
of
our
nation's
pervasive
and
influential
television
system.
we
are
supported
in
this
case,
of
course,
by
deaf
groups
around
the
country
who
really
seek
to
be
included
in
the
television
system,
where--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--certainly
that
is
a
term
of
art
with
respect
to--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--i
think
in
the
case
of
504,
i
think
discrimination
means
failure
to...
indifference,
exclusion,
and
failure
to
remove
barriers
that
are
at
least
reasonably
accommodable.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
i
think
that
is
part
of
the
definition
of
discrimination
as
well,
and
certainly
that--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--no.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
that
would
be
the
case.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
no,
although
that--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--yes,
they
are
denied
equal
access,
more
or
less,
and
denied--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--not
provided
by
reasonable
accommodations.
now,
it
is
possible
that,
as
the
commission
has
held,
that
the
policy
of
exclusion
can
be
inferred
from...
excuse
me,
a
policy
of
discrimination
can
be
inferred
from
a
policy
of
exclusion
of
minorities,
or
a
policy
of
indifference.
the
commission
has
held
that
in
a
couple
of
cases,
so
that
it
is
very
possible
that
as
a
legal
matter
there
would
be
discrimination,
although
somebody
does
not
have
the
animus,
which
is
hard
to
believe,
that
somebody
would
actually
discriminate
against
the
disabled.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
certainly
you
are
not
under
any
obligation,
legal
obligation,
as
is
in
this
case,
but
i
think
that...
and
i
would
also
preface
by
saying
that
the
court
has
been
accommodating
to--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--not
under
the
law.
not
under
the
law.
i
don't
think
the
court
would
be
covered
by--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--you
mean,
if
the
court--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--actually,
i
am...
i
don't
know
if
the
court
is
considered...
you
mean,
under
section
504,
or
just
generally
discrimination?
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
i
think
what
is
required
is
reasonable
accommodation
under
the
standard
of
davis
and
other
cases
that
have
looked
at
what
is
discrimination
against
the
disabled.
reasonable
accommodation
might
mean
allowing
signing,
as
the
court
has
done.
it
may
mean...
or
the
case
of
a
lawyer
who
wants
to
argue,
to
allow
for
simultaneous
captioning.
i
think
the
court's
record
in
this
area
is
exemplary,
but
not
to
allow...
not
to
have
amplification
equipment
that
may
or
may
not
help
other
people
i
don't
think
is
required.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
i
don't
think
you
are
defined
as
a
federal
agency,
are
you?
0
[generallaughter.]
officially.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
federally
funded,
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--right.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
right.
we
are
accountable
to
you,
not
the
other
way
around,
as
the
licensees
are
accountable
to
the
fcc
and
to
the
public.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
right,
and
i
think
that
i
was
somewhat
careful
not
to
only
use
the
word
"discrimination",
but
also
use
the
other
words
of
the
statute,
which
say
not
to
exclude
from
the
benefits
or
deny
participation.
in
other
words,
the
statute,
i
think,
still
given
the
davis
case,
which
says
that
it
really
is
talking
about
intentional
discrimination,
but
it
also
goes
on
to
say
that
discrimination,
there
is
a
fine
line
between
discrimination
and
failure
to
afford
affirmative
action,
illegal
discrimination
versus
affirmative
action.
i
think
that
504
was
definitely
intended
to
allow
for
access
by
the
disabled
to
america's
institutions.
it
was
really
a
step
forward.
is
was
the
magna
carta
of
civil
rights
for
the
disabled,
and
in
this
case,
i
think
that
congress
also
intended
that
this
magna
carta
be
taken
into
account
not
simply
by
an
occasional
funding
agency
or
at
the
whim
of
the
funding
agency,
but
by
all
the
government.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
one
government...
the
one
government
institution
which
is
charged
with
the
overall
regulation
of
television
may
ignore
or
find
irrelevant
congressional
policy
designed
to
aid
the
handicapped
when
it
considers
a
license
renewal
application
of
an
applicant
who
is
subject
to
this
requirement,
and
it
is
clear
in
this
case
that
kcet
is
subject
to
the--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--yes.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
in
that
case,
then
the
rule
was
adopted
pursuant
to
504.
presumably
that
could
be
reviewed
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
it
has
a
rule.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes,
or
presumably
at
the
license
renewal
time,
and
that--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--i
think
that
if
the
rule
were
an
illegal
rule,
were
found
to
be
contrary
to
the
law,
i
think
that
it
could
be
attacked.
it
would
be
certainly
an
unusual
situation.
i
can't
think
offhand
of
one--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--well,
the
commission--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--no,
the
commission
has
one
grave
omission,
and
that
omission
is
504.
when
it
adopted
these
policies,
when
it
looked,
you
know,
at
this
application,
it
did
not
take
into
account
the
fact
that
congress
intended
that
those
who
are
disabled
have
access
to
the
communications
system.
we
are
talking
here
about
the
communications
handicapped,
the
people
who
really
don't
have
the
opportunity
to
partake
in
this
system,
and
here
is
an
opportunity
not
only
to
include
them,
but
certainly
to
look
at
how
the
recipients
of
federal
financial
assistance,
those
who
are
under
a
specific
law,
to
apply
this
standard
of
inclusion,
of
non-discrimination,
however
we
want
to
describe
the
dictates
of
504.
it
had
an
opportunity
to
bring
them
into
the
communications
system,
and
instead
what
it
did
was
say,
we
will
not
look
at
this.
this
is
irrelevant.
this
is...
a
licensee
can
do
nothing
and
still
comply.
in
fact,
it
could
discriminate,
presumably.
let's
say
that
a
licensee
intentionally...
i
can't
understand
why,
but
let's
say
that
a
licensee
would
intentionally
refuse
to
carry,
let's
say,
close
captioned.
in
fact,
there
is
a
licensee
that
when
they
get
the
closed
captions,
they
remove
the
closed
captions,
as
i
understand
it,
before
they
send
it
out.
now,
i
am
not
saying
this
is
a
public
broadcasting
station,
but
let's
say
that
the
licensee
actually
takes
that
affirmative
step.
the
commission
would
say,
this
is
irrelevant.
it
doesn't
matter
what
you
do
or
what
you
don't
do,
in
terms
of
providing
some
service
for
the
hearing
impaired.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
i
think
so,
certainly,
because--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--well,
i
wouldn't
have
to
say
that,
because
in
this
case
there
was
no
reasonable
expectation
that
another
agency
would
act.
in
other
words,
i
don't
have
to
say
it
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
because
the
commission
was
told,
and
it
admitted
that
hew,
who
they
were
deferring
to,
had
no
intention
to
act
until
congress
passed
a
law
to
decide
which
agency
was
the
appropriate
agency.
there
was
no
reasonable
expectation
that
there
would
be
action
in
this
case,
and--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--no.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
no.
your
honor,
quite
the
contrary.
certainly
in
1974
the
only
statutory
history
we
have
on
section
503,
which...
actually
it
was
a
year
later
when
they
amended
the
law,
the
congress
made
very
clear
in
the
senate
report
that
they
expected
action
by
the
end
of
1974.
they--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--well,
they
were
mainly
looking
for
guidelines
from
the
hew,
but
they
also
specified
that
there
was
no
specific
enforcement
mechanism
in
the
statute.
the
commission
is
arguing
that
there
was...
i
think
what
they
have
to
be
arguing
is
that
the
legislative
history
intended
that
they
not
consider,
because
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
section
504,
the
fcc
did
consider
allegations
of
discrimination,
allegations
of
employment
discrimination
as
well
as
programming
discrimination,
whether
or
not
there
is
an
eeoc
in
existence,
and
congress
just
intended
to
adopt
a
civil
rights
law
for
the
disabled
as
it
has
for
the
minorities
and
women,
and
for
them
to
say
that
the
fcc
is
intended
not
to
enforce
this,
or...
excuse
me.
we
are
not
even
talking
about
enforcement
here.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
consideration.
all
the
court
held
in
this
case
was
not
that
the
fcc
has
to
be
the
primary
enforcer
or
actually
enforce
the
law.
they
are
saying,
take
this
into
consideration
when
you
look
at
the
public
interest
merits
of
a
license.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--in
this
case,
and
they
did
say
the
special
circumstances
of
this
case,
they
said
that
deference...
that
they
couldn't
defer.
in
fact,
i
would
point
out--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--yes.
but
i...
the
special
circumstances
of
this
case
are
not
only
what
the
court
has
pointed
out,
but
in
this
case
the
commission
did
not
condition
the
license,
so
in
other
words,
let's
say
that
a
further
decision
had
been
made
by
the
department
of
education
now
that
did
relate
to
the
license
period,
and
by
the
way,
they
are
not
even
considering
factors
that
relate
to
the
license
period,
which
is
the
period
in
question
under
fcc
law.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
your
honor,
in
this
case,
had
we
won,
it
would
simply
be
considered
as
a...
we
would
go
through
a
hearing.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
that's
the
extreme
relief
that
is
possible.
in
fact--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
law
we
put
in,
you
petition
to
deny.
that's
the
standard
procedure.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
we
want
access
of
programming
for
the
deaf.
we
want
recognition.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
your
honor,
we
would
like
to
see...
i'm
stepping
back
from
this
case
for
a
second.
we
would
like
to
see
a
rule
of
broad
applicability.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
the
commission
can
choose
whether
it
proceeds
by
rulemaking
or
adjudication.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
it
would
have
been
tremendous
if
the
commission
had
proceeded
by
rulemaking,
but
they
specifically
declined
to
adopt
a
rule.
now,
when
we
come
before
them
in
an
adjudication,
they
say,
there
is
no
rule,
therefore
we
won't
consider
it.
i
mean,
it's
a
catch
22
that
the
deaf
are
faced
with.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
the
commission...
what
we
want
is
a
guideline.
now,
it
can
come...
if
the
commission--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--no,
i
think
the
court
recognized
that
the
licensee
would
not
lose
its
license,
that
in
fact
there
are
plenty
of
other
sanctions
that
are
available
to
the
commission
in
this
area.
they
can
apply
prospective
reporting
requirements.
they
can
give
a
conditional
license.
they
can
admonish
a
licensee.
they
can
even
inquire.
they
did
none
of
these.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
we
certainly
allege
that
their
refusal
to
carry
the
abc
captioned
news,
for
example,
or
their
refusal
to
put
on
the
captioned
version
of...
was
indicative
of
an
attitude
of
indifference,
at
the
least.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
there
were
118
stations
around
the
country
that
were
carrying
the
abc
captioned
news
when
the
los
angeles
station,
where
there
may
be
the
second
most
number
of
people
who
are
deaf
in
the
country,
was
not
carrying
this.
i
mean,
there
was
a
certain
indifference
going
on
here.
and
it
led
to
the
situation
where
the
deaf
were
picketing
the
station,
and
finally
they
put
it
on
at
11:30
at
night
and
repeated
it
at
6:30
the
next
morning,
and...
sometimes.
sometimes
they
didn't
put
it
on
at
11:30.
and
that
was
considered
under--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--no,
we--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--yes,
the
commission's...
that's
right.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
their
attitude.
there
was
a
request
for
action.
they
constantly
say,
we
will
not
adopt
a
rule,
and
then
the
only
way
to
come
before
them...
this
is
the
appropriate...
at
this
point,
this
is
the
appropriate
means
of
trying
to
seek
a
guideline
as
to
what--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--that's
right.
and
also
there
are
other
advantages
of
adjudication.
looking
at
a
case
specifically,
just
as
your
honor
would
prefer
to
have
the
specifics
of
a
case
before
you
than
the
abstract,
is
very
helpful
to
an
agency,
and
of
course
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
agency
with
the
expertise
over
broadcasting.
i
would
point
out,
for
example,
in
the
commission's
brief
they
issue
certain...
they
mention
certain
requirements
that
would
be
necessary
for
a
504
application
to
television.
two
of
those,
at
page
32,
are,
it
must
not
place
unreasonable
restrictions
upon
the
journalistic
and
artistic
freedom
of
television
broadcasters
and
producers.
it
must
not
impose
such
high
costs
on
public
television
stations
that
they
are
driven
out
of
business
or
forced
to
curtail
other
important
services.
now,
how
does
the
agency
that
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
licensing
these
television
stations,
and
remember
that
our
system
is
that
we
deny
the
right
to
broadcast
to
everyone
but
the
few
licensees
who
get
these
licenses,
and
once
they
have
those
licenses,
they
are
public
trustees
accountable
now
every
five
years
to
the
government,
and
to
the
people,
and
how
they
are
going
to
avoid
looking
at
this
question
when
these
requirements
are
only
within
their
expertise...
i
mean,
they
are
suggesting
that
you
go
to
the
department
of
hew,
which
is
now
the
department
of
education.
the
licensee
in
this
case
was
funded
by
the
department
of
education
for
certain
programming,
by
the
department
of
commerce.
they
get
equipment.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
the
only
thing
that
they
did
was,
in
1970...
i
will
go
through
it.
in
1970,
they
said
it
would
be
very
good
to
have
television
accessible
to
the
deaf.
we
are
suggesting
certain
items,
but
we
will
adopt
no
rule,
and
by
the
way,
this
was
on
a
request
for
ruling.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
they
suggested
some
things.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
if
they
read
the
deaf
captioning
decision
at
26
fcc
2nd
916
or
whatever.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
i
would
hope
so.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
the
commission
has
never...
won't
look
at
that
question.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
i
think
that
they
aren't
in
compliance
with
the
suggestions.
the
suggestions
were
such
things
as
getting
together
with
other
licensees
and--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--no,
it
said
that
they
had
not.
they
had
not--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--they
have
not
done
everything
that
the
commission
suggested
in
the
1970
statement.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
they
have
not.
no.
they...
not
only
that,
the
commission
has
not
looked
at
it.
they
refuse
to
look
at
that
question.
they
said,
we
adopted
no
rule,
then
they...
but
they
did
say,
this
is
up
to
each
individual
licensee
to
show...
to
determine
how
to
serve
their
local
communities.
we
have
come
in
and
said
that
they
are
not
serving
their
local
community.
it
could
be
a
case
now
where
the
commission's
position
is
that
somebody
has
affirmatively
refused
to
carry
captioned
programming,
to
send
out
the
encoded
signal,
taken
an
affirmative
step.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
they
did
when
they
adopted
the
line
21
captioning,
said
that...
at
that
time,
they
said
it
is
still
up
to
each
individual
licensee.
it
is
each
individual
licensee's
responsibility
to
serve
the
local
community,
the
local
deaf
community.
they
indicated
that
that
would
be
something--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
the
court
of
appeals
was
extremely
careful
and
extremely
narrow
in
this
decision
to
say
in
the
special
circumstances
of
this
case
the
fcc
must...
cannot
ignore
the
dictates
of
504.
when
they
look
at
these
questions,
they
just
should
consider
the
fact
that
congress
intended
that
the
deaf
have
some
access,
that
they
not
be
ignored,
and
that
certainly
was
the
thrust
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes.
but
of
course--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--well,
i
don't
think
they
could
have
taken
it
into
account
in
this
decision
without
actually
proceeding
with
revocation
action,
because
they
did
not
condition
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding
on
the
outcome
of
any
other
proceedings
in
the
government.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
have
to
inquire
into
the
good
faith
of
the
licensee
as
to
how
they
were--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--i
think
that
the...
i
suppose
that
if...
first
of
all--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--well,
there
are...
the
commission
has
a
variety
of
options
that
the
court
left
open
to
them.
the
court
very
much
recognized
this
court's
requirement
that
the
court
allow...
defer
to
the
commissions'
discretion,
so
they
left
open
the
procedures
to
the
commission.
now,
one
possibility
would
be
that
the
commission
would
designate
for
hearing,
in
which
case
i
would
expect
that
the
licensee
would
come
forward
with
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
bringing
forth
affidavits
of
various
commission...
i
mean,
various
station
officials
to
discuss
what
they
had
done
and--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--that's
right.
that
is
all--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--well,
the
commission
must
be
reasonable.
let's
take
the
situation
of--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--beyond
the
hearing,
we
would
like
guidelines.
i
think
that
what
the
commission
would
have
to
do--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--well,
the
commission
has
done
this
on
numerous
occasions.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
the
commission
could
defer...
this
is
another
possibility.
the
commission
could
institute
a
rulemaking.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
i
would
like
to
see
a
rulemaking,
but--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--pardon?
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
in
the
petition
before
the
commission.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
it
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
of
the
d.c.
circuit.
we
were
asked
to
keep
down
the
record.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
it
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
it's
in
the
record.
the
record
would
include,
i
assume,
the
joint
appendix
of
the
d.c.
circuit,
and
we
were
asked
to
keep
the
record
down.
the
commission
did
not...
well,
i
don't
want
to
go
into
the
joint
appendix
problems,
but
i
apologize
for
not
having--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
this
has
been
held
by
everyone
who
has
looked
at.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
the
district
court--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--yes,
the
district
court
in
los
angeles
held
that
they
were
subject
to
504.
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
held
that
they
were
subject
to
504.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
licensee
is...
receives
assistance
not
only
from
the
department
of
education,
the
department
of
commerce,
the
national
endowment
for
the
arts,
the
national
endowment
for
the
humanities,
the
u.s.
information
administration,
but
also
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting
and
the
public
broadcasting
service,
and
particularly
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting
is...
they
float
through
federal
funds
to
the
licensee,
but
they
do
not...
they
are
not
a
federal
agency.
they
don't
have
the
enforcement
power.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
the
court
of
appeals
disposed
of
it
in
a
footnote.
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
i
don't
see
how
the
fact
that
the
licensee
got
$5
million
in
federal
money
in
1977,
and
how
they
have
gotten
something
like
30
percent
of
their
money
from
federal
subsidies
can
be
a
difficult
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
subject
to
504.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes,
there
was
an
action.
there
was
such
an
action.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
no,
the...
well--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--the
result
was
that
the
court
found
that
they
couldn't...
that
there
was
no
standard
by
any
of
these
funding
agencies.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
it
was
the...
actually,
the
licensee
in
that
decision,
and
that
is,
i
think,
at
page
149
of
the
joint
appendix
that
you
have,
argued
that
there
was
primary
jurisdiction
in
the
fcc.
that
is
where
they
told...
that
is
what
they
were
telling
the
court.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
it
is
on
appeal
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
no,
no.
the
district
court
found
that
the...
they
dismissed
the
licensee
because
there
was
no
standards
for
the
licensee
to
comply
with,
and
they
then
issued
an
order
for
the--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--by
the
funding
agencies,
and
they
included
the
federal
communications
commission.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes.
yes,
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
failing
to
consider
a
relevant
factor,
making
the
consideration
of
a
law
that
is
clearly
relevant
to
communications,
to
the
communications
act...
we
are
talking
about
inclusion
of
a
segment...
a
minority
segment
of
the
audience,
something
that
really
goes
to
the
underlying
purposes
of
the
communications
act.
in
fact,
if
you--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--well,
the
agencies
that
they
deferred
to
do
not
have
life
and
death
control.
the
life
or
death
control
is
the
commission's,
and
in
fact--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--they
can,
and
that
would
be
an
extreme
remedy
which
we
frankly
would
not
like
to
see,
but
the...
because
we
would
like
to
see
public...
we
don't
want
to
hurt
public
broadcasting.
we
are
trying
to
get
more
service,
not
less.
in
other
words,
the
remedy...
we
were
faced
there
with
a
remedy
that
is
an
unsatisfactory
remedy
to
everyone.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
okay.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
no,
your
honor,
it
isn't,
quite
honestly.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes,
but
it
is
still
aimed
at--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--that's
right,
which
is
this
licensee.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
that's
right.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
a
licensee
who
received
money
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
however,
some
of
the--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--perhaps
that
would
be
the
extreme
repercussion.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
your
honor,
and
i
would
really
like
to
go
to
the
statutory
scheme,
which
contemplates
not
only
that
these
factors
would
be
enforced
at
the
individual
funding
agencies,
and
by
the
way,
they
get
most
of
their
funds
from
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting,
which
cannot
in
fact
enforce
this
statute.
they
also
get
a
lot
of
their
equipment
from
the
department
of
commerce
through
facilities
grants,
and
how
do
you
enforce
that
after
you
have
given
them
the
facilities?
i
mean,
there
are
some
real
problems
with
the
enforcement
aspect
here.
but
in
the
end,
it
is
really
the
fcc
that
must
look
at
the
overall
operation
of
the
station.
the
fact
that
this
licensee
is
subject
to
this
law
is
simply...
i
mean,
is
very
importantly
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
account
when
they
look
at
whether
or
not
a
licensee
is
law
abiding,
and
look
at
the
character
of
the
licensee,
look
at
the
operation
of
the
station,
look
at
the
intent
of
congress.
congress,
at
the
time
that
they
passed
the
rehabilitation
act,
the
fcc
was
considering
allegations
of
discrimination.
they
were
considering
equal
employment
allegations.
they
were
considering
programming
allegations.
even
though
these
could
have
been
affected
by
going
to
an
agency.
let
me
give
an
example.
let's
say
that
in
jackson,
mississippi,
there
is
a
licensee
who
always
excluded
blacks
from
the
screen,
and
they
got
money
from
the
federal
government
through...
let's
say
they
are
a
public
licensee
and
they
got
their
equipment,
say,
from
the
government.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
that's
right,
and
the
commission
had
an
obligation
to--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--but
the
commission
is
saying
that
if
there
is
another
agency...
that's
exactly
what
this
case
is
about.
if
there
is
another
agency
who
can
enforce
this
law,
because
the
law
would
be
title
vi,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
title
vi,
if
there
is
another
agency
that
can
enforce
that,
we
won't
look
at
it.
in
that
case,
the
commission...
the
analogy
would
be
here,
we
are
not
going
to
look
at
it
until
another
agency
decides
whether
or
not
there
is
a
violation.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
your
honor,
the
percentage
is
in
single
figures,
i
think.
the
hearing
impaired
may
be
5
percent.
the
severely
hearing
impaired
may
be
5
percent.
somewhere
between...
around
5
to
7
percent
or
so.
but
that
i
don't
think
is
the
proper
criterion
in
this
case
to
consider.
the
fact
is
that
congress
intended
to
protect
this
class
of
people.
it
intended
that
licensees
who
receive
federal
money
open
up,
lower
their
barriers
to
the
provision
of
the
programming
for
these
people,
and
the
fcc
would
be
the...
really
the
appropriate
place
to
exert
their
expertise.
i
mean,
this...
we
are
talking
about
an
educational,
informational,
vital
part
of
this
country
which
is,
for
better
or
worse,
television,
and
it
is
considered
maybe
the
second
most
influential
institution
in
the
united
states,
and
we
are
now
in
1982,
and
there
are...
the
commission
has
still
not
looked
at
this
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
licensee
is
complying
or
even
serving
the
purposes
of
the
communications
act...
i
mean,
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
i
think
that
congress
intended
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
504
that
this
would
be
a
broad
policy,
and
i
would
like
to
bring
the
court
to
the
cases
where
the
court
has
said
that
the
fcc
cannot
ignore
a
relevant
statute.
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
one
that
the
commission
cites
in
its
eeo
rules,
where
the
national
labor
relations
board
wanted
to
reinstate
some
employees
on
a
ship
who
had
struck
and
in
fact
the
court
found
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
mutiny,
that
the
actual
strike
happened
to
be
a
violation
of
the
mutiny
laws,
and
they
said,
you
cannot
apply
the
national
labor
relations
act
without
considering
other
relevant
statutes
to
this
matter.
there
is
no
question
that
congress
intended
this
law
to
be
a
broad
policy
to
include
the
deaf,
include
the
disabled,
and
what
the
commission
is
saying,
and
i
think
quite
clearly,
today,
is,
this
is
not
something
that
we
must
take
into
account
when
we
have...
make
our
independent
public
interest
standard,
and
there
are
plenty
of
cases,
including
the
united
church
of
christ
case,
which
say
that
the
commission
must
look
at
the
facts
of
that
case.
remeber,
in
that
case
they
tried
to
defer
the
question
of
the
discrimination.
it
is
a
very
similar
situation.
let's
say
that
the
commission
in
that
case
said,
well,
this
is
something
for
another
agency
to
decide,
we
won't
decide
it,
and
they
waited
and
waited,
and
another
agency
didn't
come
forward.
or
the
npc
case,
which
proposes
or
suggests...
this
is
the
u.s.
supreme
court
case...
that
because
the
licensee
might
be
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
which
of
course
the
justice
department
primarily
enforces,
does
not
mean
that
the
commission
must
not
take
the
policies
of
the
antitrust
laws
into
account
in
the
communications
act.
they
have
tried
to
distinguish
the
antitrust
laws
by
saying,
well,
this
is
so
clearly
related
to
the
communications
act.
there
is
no
question
that
the
provision
of
service
to
minority
groups
is
vitally
important
to
the--
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
--they
weren't,
but
there
are
other
cases
where
courts
of
appeals
have
required,
and
the
supreme
court,
required
that
they
take
into
account
the...
such
as
the
southern
steamship
case
that
i
was
referring
to
a
minute
ago.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
yes,
but
the
principle
is
the
same.
the
principle
is
that
where
there
is
a...
and
the
naacp
case
is
another
example.
now,
there,
the
naacp
adopted
a
rule,
but
the
point
is
that
where
there
is
a
clearly
relevant
statute,
that
what
is
happening
here
is
that
congress...
that
the
fcc
is
ignoring
congressional
policy.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
it
is
wrong
if
the
statute
that
they
are
excluding
relates
to
the
underlying
values
of
the
communications
act.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
may
they
exclude
any
statute
that
has
relevance?
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
they...
i
would
first
preface
this
by
saying
that
that
is...
this
case...
that
is
broader
than
what
this
case
holds,
and
it
is
broader
than
the
naacp
versus
federal
power
commission.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
because
the
commission
abused
its
discretion
by
failing
to
consider
this
relevant
factor
which
they
agree
is
relevant.
the
commission
itself
said,
well,
we
will
take
this
into
account
at
a
later
time,
perhaps,
although
they
didn't
condition...
they
didn't
do
the
formal
action
that
they
needed
to
do
in
order
to
take
that
into
account,
but
where
there
is
a
relevant
statute,
certainly
they
must
consider...
this
is...
says
the
same
where
the
court
says,
okay,
when
we
look
over...
the
reviewing
standard
is
arbitrary,
capricious,
abuse
of
standard,
or
abiding
by
law,
and
part
of
that
discussion
and
search,
scrutiny
by
the
court
is
whether
or
not
they
considered
all
relevant
factors.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
well,
i
think
what
they
would
have
to
do
is
at
least
look
at
the
allegations.
mr.
charles
m.
firestone
no,
what
they
did
was,
they
looked
at
those
allegations
in
consideration
of
another
factor.
in
other
words,
they
looked
at-it
without
taking
into
account
what
the
congressional
policy
was
with
respect
to
the
deaf.
they
said,
okay,
we
are
not
going
to
look
at
the
programming
scheduling,
but
they
didn't
look
at
the
programming
scheduling
and
the
decision
of
the
licensee
not
to
carry
this
programming,
for
example,
with
the
idea
in
mind
of
congress
intending
that
the
deaf...
that
the
recipients
of
federal
financial
assistance
make
reasonable
accommodations
to
serve
the
disabled.
that
was
plain
and
simple
what
happened
here,
was
ignoring
of
federal
policy
and
a
clearly
relevant
statute
to
the
public
interest
standard,
and
the
commission's
failure
to
judge
management
of
discrimination.

you,
your
honor.
