justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
if...
assume
the
unfair
labor
practice
had
been
adjudicated
by
the
nlrb,
or
that
it
hadn't,
but
the
intervenor
called
the
fcc's
attention
to
an
adjudicated
unfair
labor
and
an
alleged
unadjudicated
one.
could
the
fcc
say,
sorry,
that
is
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
ask
that.
could
they
say
it
legally?
must
they...
must
they
take
into
account
this
failure
of
a
licensee
to
live
up
to
the
requirements
of
another
law?
must
they
take
that
into
account?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
this
case,
then?
didn't
the
fcc
say
that
the
licensee's
conduct
under
section
504
is
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
irrelevant
to
the
license
renewal
proceedings.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
until
some
other
agency
acted
on
it,
it
was
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway,
they
would
not
take
evidence
as
to
what
the
station's
conduct
was
with
respect
to
504--
justice
byron
r.
white
--as
long
as
there
had
been
no
adjudication
by
some
other
agency.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
the
commission
then
have
a
hearing
on
the
allegations
that
a
station
hadn't
lived
up
to
its
obligations
under
504?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
allegedly
had
run
afoul
of
504.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
the
commission
listens
to
allegations
that
the
station
hasn't
lived
up
to
some
of
its
obligations
under
some
other
statutes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
commission
in
this
case,
or
did
it
not,
rule
that
the
section
504
provided
no
basis
for
the
non-renewal
of
the
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
it
must
be
one
or
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
couldn't
be
both
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
fcc
would
have
no
authority
by
rule
to
say
that
because
of
504
the
stations
must
do
so
and
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
when
it
says
particularly
because
of
504,
the
requirements
of
504,
we
are
incorporating
into
our
public
interest
standard,
it
would
have
authority
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
did
here
just
reject
the
submission
without
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
wasn't
going
to
take
any
evidence
about
the
station's
performance
with
respect...
under
504.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
apparently
it
did
think
that
the
station
wasn't
out
of
line
in
terms
of
what
the
commission's
own
judgment
had
been
in
the
past
about
what
stations
ought
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
commission's
policy
was,
the
station
should
not
be
made
to
do
anything
with
respect
to
504.
justice
byron
r.
white
must
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
case
you
just
cited?
did
it
have
to
take
antitrust
considerations
into
account?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
submission
on
that?
must
it,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about...
let's
just
take
the
antitrust
case
then,
if
you
want
to
do
it
case
by
case.
must
it
take
antitrust
considerations
into
account?
justice
byron
r.
white
sometimes
it
must?
in
the
context
of
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
sometimes
it
must?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
must
in
certain
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
our
case,
it
must
take
into
consideration
in
the
proper
case,
as
you
say,
the
conduct
of
the
licensee
in
the
light
of
504.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
a...
i
asked
you
earlier
in
this
argument,
didn't
they
say,
it
is
irrelevant
until
and
unless
some
other
agency
decides
there
has
been
a
violation?
because
they
had
no
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
because
they
felt
that
they
were
at
least
in
line
with
commission
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
word...
when
you
use
the
word
"discrimination",
what
do
you
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
just
wondering...
it
must
be
in
your
mind,
so
how
is
it
defined
in
your
mind?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
suggest
it
means
purposeful
discrimination
because
somebody
can't
hear?
justice
byron
r.
white
somebody
is
discriminating
against
them
because
they
can't
hear?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
you
really
mean,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
they
are
discriminating
in
the
sense
they
don't
have
the
same
opportunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
not
provided
equal
access.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
we
subject
to
504?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
aren't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
are
funded.
i
suppose
we
are
funded.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
one
can
cancel
our
license.
we
are
not
funded
by
grants
under
the
program,
are
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
commission
said,
well,
we
are
going
to
adopt
a
rule
that
we
think
504
is
a
relevant
matter
for
the
public
interest,
and
here
is
our
rule,
here
is
what
stations
must
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
a
station
comes
up
for
license
renewal,
and
the
commission
rules
that
the
station
is
in
perfect
conformity
with
its
rule,
and
denies
a
hearing
on
allegations
that
the
station
has
not
lived
up
to
504.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
action
or
the
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well,
the
rule
could
be
subject
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
think
the
rule
could
be
attacked
at
license
renewal
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
commission...
i
gather
the
commission's
argument
is
that
it
has
done
internally
all
that
it
thinks
necessary
under
504.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
it
doesn't
need
to
listen
to
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you,
suppose
the
funding
agency
had
considered
a
complaint
that
this
particular
funded
station
hadn't
lived
up
to
its
obligations
under
504,
and
had
decided
that...
had
rejected
the
complaint,
and
said
the
station
was
living
up
to
its
obligations
under
504,
doing
all
that
was
reasonably
necessary,
and
then
the
station
came
up
for
license
renewal.
could
you
relitigate
that
whole
question
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
say
that,
i
gather,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
firestone,
i
take
it
your
position
is,
and
arguably
it
is
correct,
that
the
commission
ruled
that
considerations
of
504
are
irrelevant
to
the
license
renewal
proceeding.
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
the
commission.
the
commission's
action
was--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
it
is
irrelevant,
it
is
just
beside
the
point,
in
which
event
they
would
say
also
if
you
asked
them
to
make
a
rule
that
that
is
irrelevant,
too,
because
it
just...
until
somebody
else
does
something,
it
is
none
of
our
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
won't
make
a
rule,
you
want
it
by
adjudication
at
an
appropriate
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
commission
in
any
manner
short
of
rulemaking
has
ever
communicated
to
any
station
what
its
preferments
are
with
respect
to
the
handicapped?
are
you
a
communications
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
aware
that
the
commission
has
ever
taken
any
position
with
respect
to
communicating
with
the
people
who
can't
hear
very
well?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
suggested
it,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
people
knowledgeable
in
the
business
knew
what
the
suggestions
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
lawyers
for
stations
usually
do,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
was
this
station
in
compliance
with
the
suggestions
of
the
commission,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
asking
you,
not
the
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
station
has
followed
the
lead
of
the
commission,
is
doing
everything
the
commission
thought
needed
to
be
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
station
has
not
done
everything
the
commission
thought
should
be
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
they
haven't?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
in
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
in
the
record
that
has
been
lodged
here,
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
in
the
printed--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
is
in
the
record
lodged
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
have
just
gone
into
a
district
court
somewhere
and
sought
to
enjoin
or
to
get
an
injunction
against
the
station
for
violations
of
504?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
was
such
an
action.
did
you
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
result
of
the
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
they
say
you
should
go
to
the
funding
agency,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
lose,
or
what
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
lost
in
the
district
court
on
the
grounds
that
that
was
the
wrong
place
to
go?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
standards
issued
by
the
funding
agency.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
504,
though,
isn't
a
commerce
power
regulation.
it's
spending
power,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
only
affects
people
who
get
federal
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
a
general
regulation
that
people
who
communicate
over
the
airways
that
are
granted,
that
are
licensed
through
a
public
authority
are
subject
to
this
regulation.
it
is
just
people
who
get
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
the
fcc
must
take
into
account
any
clearly
defined
federal
policy
expressed
in
a
statute?
every
one.
and
that
the
fcc
is
not
free
to
say
in
administering
the
public
interest
standard
that
we
are
going
to
exclude
from
our
considerations
of
the
public
interest
standard
statute
a,
b,
and
c,
but
include
them
in
d,
e,
and
f.
you
say
that
is
just
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
may
they
exclude
any
statute
that
has
some
relevance
to
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--from
consideration
of
the
public
interest?
they
say,
we
are
in
charge
of
administering
the
public
interest
standard,
here
is
a
statute
we
think
is
too
tangential
to
be
considered.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
surely
the
court
of
appeals
imposed
ingredients
of
the
public
interest
that
the
communcations
commission
rejected.
they
are
saying,
you
must
consider
part
of
the
public
interest,
a,
b,
and
c,
even
though
you
don't
want
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
commission
had
undertaken
a
rulemaking
proceeding
about
this
subject,
and
the
submissions
were
so
confusing
and
the
technology
in
such
a
state
of
flux
that
they
declined
to
issue
any
rule,
that
it
just
wasn't
timely
to
issue
a
rule
right
now,
and
then
the
next
day
this
submission
is
made,
that
the
license
should
be
denied
because
of
failure
to
live
up
to
504.
can't
the
commission
say,
awfully
sorry,
but
it
just
isn't...
now
is
just
not
the
time
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
did
look
at
the
allegations,
and
they
said,
we
don't
want
to
have
another
hearing,
we
just
decided
that
it
isn't
time
to
have
a
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
colleague
denied
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
complied
with
everything
the
fcc
had
suggested
stations
ought
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suggest,
suggest.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
suggest?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
not
even
scores?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
violate
their
license
if
they
broadcast
one,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
didn't,
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can
certainly
finish
your--
justice
byron
r.
white
--finish
your
answer
to
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
quite.
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
find,
or
has
anybody
found,
or
is
it
just
your
assertion,
that
the
station
had
lived
up
to
every
suggestion
that
the
fcc
had
made
about
taking
care
of
the
handicapped?
