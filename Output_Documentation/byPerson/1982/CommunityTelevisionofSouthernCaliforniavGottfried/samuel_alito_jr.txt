mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
narrow
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
which
agency
or
agencies
have
the
responsibility
for
construing
and
enforcing
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
must
the
fcc
do
so
in
licensing
proceedings,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
or
is
the
responsibility
for
interpreting
and
enforcing
section
504
exclusively
that
of
the
funding
agencies,
as
we
believe
congress
determined?
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
it
could
be
both,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
congress
intended
for
section
504
to
be
enforced
by
the
funding
agencies
exclusively,
and
not
by
agencies
like
the
fcc,
that
do
not
provide--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--that's
correct.
we
believe
that
congress's
intent
was
that
it
be
enforced--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
believe
the
fcc
certainly
has
the
authority
under
its
own
public
interest
standard
to
impose
captioning
requirements,
and
it
has
said
so.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
believe
that
the
enactment
of
504
or
any
other
statute
is
something
that
the
commission
could
take
into
consideration
in
making
its
public
interest
determination,
but
i
don't
believe
the
commission
can
take
upon
itself
the
responsibility
for
enforcing
statutes
if
that
responsibility
was
committed
to
other
agencies
by
congress,
and
i
think--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--oh,
i
agree
that
that
is
a
relevant
factor,
your
honor.
the
commission--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
the
commission
has
taken
the
position
that
a
station
that
refuses
to
employ
persons
regardless
of
race,
sex,
national
origin,
or
religion,
cannot
provide
service
to
all
members
of
the
community,
as
is
required
by
the
communications
act.
it
is--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
think
it's
necessary
to
draw
a
sharp
distinction
between
the
enforcement
of
other
statutes
or
the
policies
they
express
merely
because
those
policies
happen
to
be
expressed
in
the
statute
and
a
factor
that
the
commission
determines
to
be
relevant
under
the
public
interest
standard.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
certainly
is
severe.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
certainly
is
a
severe
sanction.
the
question
is
whether
it
is
the
sanction
congress
intended
in
this
instance,
and
our
position
is,
congress
intended
for
section
504
to
be
enforced
by
the
funding
agencies.
the
very
structure
of
section
504
points
clearly
in
that
direction.
504
is
not
applicable
to
all
private
entities
or
all
that
could
be
reached
under
the
commerce
clause.
it
applies
only
to
recipients
of
federal
financial
assistance.
congress
merely
attached
certain
conditions
to
the
receipt
of
federal
aid,
and
if
one
of
those
conditions
is
violated,
then
the
most
obvious
and
basic
remedies
are
to
cut
off
the
funding
or
to
enjoin
the
recipient
from
continued
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
grant.
now,
the
fcc
and
other
licensing
agencies,
unlike
the
funding
agencies
and
unlike
the
courts,
lack
the
power
to
do
either
of
those
things.
so,
as
i
said,
the
structure
of
section
504
makes
it
ill
suited
for
enforcement
by
agencies
like
the
federal
communications
commission.
beyond
that,
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
504
clearly
illustrates
that
congress
intended
for
that
provision
to
be
enforced
by
the
funding
agencies.
there
is
nothing
in
section
504
itself
and
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision
to
indicate
that
congress
contemplated
enforcement
by
agencies
like
the
fcc.
and
in
our
view,
that
is
highly
significant,
for
when
congress
establishes
a
comprehensive
administrative
procedure
for
the
enforcement
of
the
statute,
and
commits
that
responsibility
to
a
particular
agency
or
agencies,
and
it
says
nothing
about
enforcement
by
other
agencies,
then
we
believe
it
may
be
fairly
inferred
that
congress
intended...
did
not
intend
for
those
agencies
to
have
the
enforcement
responsibility.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
not
at
all,
your
honor.
the
fcc
has
determined
that
employment
discrimination
is
very
relevant
to
the
license...
licensing
decision,
and
thus--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--it
certainly
has,
and
it
has
said
so.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
absolutely
not.
employment
discrimination
is
different
from
captioning,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
probably
the
most
important
reason
is
that
captioning,
unlike
refraining
from
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
race
or
any
other
invidious
classification,
captioning
is
a
problem
of
considerable
technical
complexity.
the
technology
is
in
flux.
there
are
competing
technologies
at
this
time,
and
it
is
the
commission's
judgment
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
in
bringing
its
expertise
to
bear
on
this
problem
that
at
the
present
time
under
its
public
interest
standard
technological
progress
may
best
be
stimulated
by
refraining
from
imposing
compulsory
constraints,
but
the
commission
has
made
it
clear
that
it
will
continue
to
monitor
developments
in
this
area,
and
will
not
hesitate
to
impose
mandatory
requirements
if
sufficient
progress
is
not
demonstrated
by
the
broadcasters,
if
the
remaining
technical
and
financial
questions
are
not
resolved,
and
perhaps
after
section
504's
meaning
is
clarified
by
the
funding
agencies.
let
me
address
a
bit
more
directly
this
question
of
employment
discrimination,
because
it
is
central
to
respondent's
argument
and
also
to
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
the
commission's
treatment
of
employment
discrimination
and
its
treatment
of
the
problem
of
captioning
and
making
television
understandable
for
the
deaf
is
parallel
in
many
respects.
the
commission
does
not
enforce
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
which
deals
with
employment
discrimination.
the
commission
does
not
enforce
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
the
commission
has
stated
that
under
its
public
interest
standard,
it
will
take
into
account
employment
discrimination
by
licensees.
similarly,
under
its
public
interest
standard,
the
commission
has
long
sought
technically
and
financially
feasible
means
of
making
television
accessible
to
hearing
impaired
viewers,
but
it
has
reached
the
judgment
that
imposing
mandatory
captioning
requirements
at
the
present
time
under
the
public
interest
standard
is
not
wise.
the
second
point
to
remember
is
that
the
fcc
voluntarily
and
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
decided
to
take
on
the
responsibility
for
looking
at
employment
discrimination
by
licensees.
it
was
not
compelled
to
do
that
by
any
court.
and
therefore,
what
the
commission
has
done
voluntarily
in
that
area
is
hardly
precedent
for
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case.
and
the
third
point
which
i--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--the
commission's
decision
to
consider
or
not
to
consider
a
factor
would
be
tested
against
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
the
commission
might
well
have
been
held
by
a
court
to
have
abused
its
discretion
if
it
had
decided
that
no
evidence
of
employment
discrimination,
no
matter
how
invidious,
was
relevant
to
the
public
interest
standard,
and
the
same
sort
of
test
is
the
proper
one
here.
did
the
commission
abuse
its
broad
discretion
when
it
decided
to
treat
the
question
of
captioning
as
it
did?
the
commission
has
thoroughly
considered
this
problem,
and
has
developed
a
comprehensive
approach
to
the
problem,
and
its
approach
has
three
basic
parts.
it
requires
the
transmission
of
emergency
announcements
in
visual
form.
it
has
decided
that
at
the
present
time
under
the
public
interest
standard
other
mandatory
requirements
should
not
be
imposed.
it
has
stated
that
it
will
not
adjudicate
violations
of
section
504
itself,
but
will
take
into
account
as
evidence
of
a
licensee's
character
any
violations
found
by
one
of
the
appropriate
funding
agencies.
the
test
that
the
court
of
appeals
ought
to
have
applied
is,
was
this
approach
an
abuse
of
discretion,
and
if
the
court
had
applied
that
test,
we
feel
confident
it
would
have
been
required
to
sustain
the
commission's
approach.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
your
honor,
i
hope
that
that
is
not
the
argument
that
i
have
left
the
impression
i
am
advancing.
my
argument
is
that
the
commission
was
not
required
to
define
and
enforce
section
504.
the
commission
may
have
been
required
under
the
public
interest
standard
to
consider
the
problem
of
service
to
the
deaf.
the
commission
has
considered
that
problem
beginning
before
the
enactment
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
and
it
has
not
abused
its
discretion
in
the
manner
in
which
it
considered
the
problem.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
rejected
the
submission
here
without
a
hearing.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
said
that
it
would
take
into
account
any
violations
subsequently
found
by
the
appropriate
funding
agencies.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
the
commission
has
taken
the
position
that
mandatory
requirements
should
not
be
imposed,
largely
for
the
technical
reasons
that
i
have
touched
on,
and
therefore
there
was
no
reason
to
conduct
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
the
number
of
captioned
hours
broadcast
by
kcet
was
sufficient
to
meet
any
standard
previously
imposed.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
in
a
sense.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
fcc
versus
national
citizens
commission
for
broadcasting,
this
court
stated,
"while
the
commission
does
not
have
the
power
to
enforce
the
antitrust
laws
as
such,
it
is
permitted
to
take
antitrust
policies
into
account
in
making
licensing
decisions
pursuant
to
the
public
interest
standard.
"
paraphrasing
that
statement
and
applying
it
to
this
case,
while
the
commission
does
not
have
the
power
to
enforce
section
504
as
such,
it
is
permitted
to
take
the
problem
of
adapting
television
to
the
deaf
into
account
in
making
licensing
decisions
pursuant--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--that
would
be
tested
against
the
public
interest,
against
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
the
court
didn't
find
that
it
had
to.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
varies,
i
think,
your
honor,
depending
from
case
to
case.
i
don't
believe
it's
possible
to
make
a
blanket
statement.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
in
certain
contexts,
i
think
it
may
be
required
to
do
so,
but
not--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--in
certain--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--in
certain
contexts,
anticompetitive
behavior
by
a
licensee
might
be
relevant
to
the
licensing
decision.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
it
might
be
found
to
be
required
to
do
so.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
don't
mean...
by
proper
case,
i
don't
mean
the
case
of
one
licensee
as
opposed
to
another
licensee.
i
mean
with
respect
to
a
particular
problem
and
a
particular
policy.
here,
the
point
is
that
the
commission
has
adopted
a
considered
policy
with
respect
to
this
problem
of
technological
flux
and
technological
complexity.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
her
claim
was,
she
had
two
basic
claims.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
is
in
the
record
of
the
case.
it
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
it's
not.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
believe
she
had
two
principal
claims.
the
first
was
a
general
allegation
that
the
programming
of
this
licensee
and
the
other
los
angeles
television
stations
involved
was
insufficient
with
respect
to
the
deaf.
the
second
was
that
the--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--under
the...
under
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
her
second
claim
was
that
kcet
had
abused
its
discretion
by
its
decision
concerning
the
scheduling
of
the
abc
captioned
news,
and
as
to
that
question,
the
commission
inquired
into
the
matter
and
found
that
kcet
had
not
abused
its
programming
discretion.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
she
certainly
got
an
inquiry
by
the
commission
into
that
charge.
she
did
not
get
an
inquiry
into
the
general
allegation
of
insufficient
programming
for
the
deaf,
because
the
commission
does
not
have
at
this
time
mandatory
requirements
concerning
captioning.
what
is
basically
wrong
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
is
that
it
requires
the
commission
to
pave
the
way
in
construing
what
section
504
requires.
it
requires
something
more
than
simply
a
recitation
of
the
language
of
section
504,
because
504's
requirements
in
the
area
of
captioning
are
as
yet
not
fully
defined.
for
example,
it
may
be
argued
under
this
court's
decision
in
southeastern
community
college
versus
davis
that
section
504
requires
no
captioning
because
section
504
does
not
demand
expensive
affirmative
efforts
to
overcome
handicaps,
the
disabilities
imposed
by
handicap.
on
the
other
hand,
it
may
be
argued
again
based
on
davis
that
captioning
is
required
because
there
are
instances
in
which
the
refusal
to
accommodate
the
needs
of
the
handicapped
through
captioning
or
some
other
available
technology
might
amount
to
discrimination.
until
such
basic
questions
concerning
section
504's
applicability
to
the
problem
of
captioning
are
resolved,
and
in
our
view
they
should
be
resolved
by
the
funding
agencies,
it
will
be
impossible
for
the
commission
to
determine
in
a
licensing
proceeding
whether
a
licensee
had
complied
with
section
504--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--she
alleged
facts
which
she
claimed
constituted
a
violation.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
the
specific
allegation
concerned
when
kcet
began
to
broadcast
the
abc
captioned
news,
and
the
hour
at
which
it
was
programmed.
the
general
allegations
concerned
the
number
of
programs
broadcast
during
the
license
term
that
were
accessible
to
hearing
impaired
viewers.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it's
either.
they
did
not
find
that
those
did
not
constitute
a
violation
of
504.
they
certainly
did
not
say
that
whether
or
not
kcet
had
violated
504
was
irrelevant.
it
was
relevant
to
the
character,
to
kcet's
character
and
therefore
its
fitness
for
a
license,
but
the
commission
stated
that
it
would
wait
until
a
violation
of
that
statute
was
found
by
one
of
the
funding
agencies.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
wouldn't
say
they
don't
care,
your
honor.
it
is
simply
a
recognition
that
one
administrative
agency,
even
though
required
to
implement
the
public
interest,
cannot
be
expected
to
do
the
work
of
all
the
other
administrative
agencies.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
is
true
in
that
sense.
whether
or
not
they
complied
with
504.
but
not
the
general
question
of
adapting
television
to
the
deaf.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
they
felt
they
were
in
line
with
the
commission
policy
of
not
imposing
mandatory
requirements
at
this
time.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
it
is
what
the
commission
does
in
cases
of
allegations
of
individual
employment
discrimination
and
other
cases
concerning
the
violation
of
statutes
committed
by
congress
to
other
agencies.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
believe
the
fcc's
expertise
is
very
relevant
in
this
sense.
the
commission
has
brought
its
expertise
to
bear
upon
the
problem
of
captioning,
and
has
developed
an
approach,
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
applied
the
correct
test,
it
would
have
sustained
the
fcc's
exercise
of
its
expert
judgment
in
this
case.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
can
hardly
be
sustained
in
the
name
of
the
commission's
expertise,
when
that
is
precisely
what
it
upset.
there
is
something
a
little
bit
strange,
i
admit,
on
its
face,
about
the
fcc,
the
expert
in
the
area
of
broadcasting,
deferring
to
a
funding
agency,
but
this
is
where
congress
allocated
that
responsibility,
and
what
section
504
is
about,
at
least
in
part,
is
how
an
agency's
funds
are
spent,
and
the
fcc
is
not...
does
not
claim
particular
expertise
as
to
how
the
funds
of
the
department
of
education
or
another
funding
agency
should
be
spent.
thank
you.
