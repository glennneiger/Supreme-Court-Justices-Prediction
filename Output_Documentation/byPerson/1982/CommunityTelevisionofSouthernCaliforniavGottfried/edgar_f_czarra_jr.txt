mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
statutory
construction
case
involves
television
programs
for
the
deaf.
some
background
will
establish
the
context
for
the
specific
facts
and
the
narrow
legal
issue
that
is
before
the
court.
without
visual
aids,
most
deaf
persons
cannot
understand
the
sound
part
of
television.
government
agencies
and
broadcasters
have
been
working
for
more
than
a
decade
on
ways
to
provide
the
deaf
with
suitable
access
to
the
sound
part
of
television.
until
early
1980,
there
were
essentially
two
kinds
of
special
visual
aids
that
could
help
the
deaf.
one
was
sign
language
interpretation.
the
other
was
so-called
open
captions.
while
helpful
to
the
deaf,
both
are
visible
on
all
television
sets.
because
they
are
distracting
and
block
part
of
the
visual
picture,
both
impact
adversely
on
television
service
for
the
non-deaf
majority.
competing
technologies
to
produce
captions
visible
only
to
the
deaf
reached
the
developmental
stage
in
the
early
1970's,
and
have
been
evolving.
this
is
so-called
closed
captioning.
one
system
reached
the
marketplace
in
1980.
the
other
is
not
as
far
along,
but
it
may
offer
more
benefits
in
the
long
run.
basically,
both
involve
transmission
of
specially
encoded
signals
that
will
produce
captions
only
on
television
sets
that
have
special
decoding
mechanisms.
producing
captions
that
fit
the
visual
action
is
a
sophisticated
process
involving
skilled
personnel
and
special
equipment.
it
is
far
more
complex
than
flashing
a
tornado
warning
across
the
bottom
of
the
screen.
some
programs
are
not
suited
to
captions
at
all,
and
caption
is
expensive,
about
$2,500
an
hour,
and
public
television's
historic
budget
crunch
has
grown
much
worse
lately.
despite
these
difficult
problems,
great
strides
have
been
made.
due
to
a
combination
of
available
approaches,
deaf
viewers
throughout
the
country
today
have
access
to
the
sound
part
of
many
hours
of
television
each
week
on
both
commercial
and
public
stations.
now,
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
a
record
that
covers
kcet's
1974
to
1977
license
term.
this
was
long
before
closed
captioning
was
in
being.
nevertheless,
kcet
had
presented
nearly
1,000
programs
with
special
visual
aids
during
that
license
term.
the
respondents
requested
the
fcc
to
deny
kcet's
license
renewal.
they
claimed
that
kcet's
programs
for
the
deaf
were
not
enough,
and
had
not
been
presented
in
peak
viewing
hours.
respondents
focused
on
the
comparatively
new
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973,
that
prohibits
discrimination
against
handicapped
persons
by
recipients
of
federal
financial
assistance.
respondents
requested
the
fcc
to
use
its
license
renewal
processes
to
force
kcet
to
provide
more
of
the
special
services
they
believe
that
section
504
required.
three
points
made
by
the
fcc
in
denying
respondents'
complaint
merit
emphasis
here.
first,
the
fcc
found
that
kcet
had
offered
special
broadcasts
for
the
deaf,
and
had
not
abused
its
discretion
in
scheduling
them.
the
only
specific
claims
of
kcet
shortcomings
were
thus
found
baseless.
second,
the
fcc
reviewed
the
many
steps
it
had
taken
under
the
general
public
interest
standard
of
the
communications
act
concerning
television
for
the
deaf,
and
some
of
these
predated
enactment
of
section
504.
third,
the
fcc
concluded
that
it
lacked
section
504
enforcement
duties,
because
it
did
not
dispense
public
funds.
the
fcc
deferred
to
the
funding
agencies
to
decide
complaints
of
section
504
violations,
but
the
fcc
made
very
clear
that
any
finding
of
a
section
504
violation
by
kcet
would
be
given
weight.
meanwhile,
the
respondents
went
elsewhere.
they
filed
a
complaint
against
kcet
at
what
is
now
the
department
of
education,
one
of
the
funding
agencies.
they
also
brought
a
class
action
against
kcet
in
district
court.
both
complaints
charged
section
504
discrimination,
and
both
were
eventually
resolved
in
kcet's
favor.
the
respondents
then
appealed
the
fcc's
denial
of
their
complaint.
a
panel
of
the
d.c.
circuit,
speaking
through
judge
wright,
with
judge
mcgowan
dissenting,
reversed
the
fcc.
its
decision
ignored
the
extensive
record
evidence
of
kcet's
service
to
the
deaf,
as
well
as
the
fcc's
conclusions
about
it.
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
d.c.
circuit.
the
sole
basis
for
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
was
its
belief
that
section
504
expressed
such
a
strong
national
policy
in
favor
of
the
deaf
that
the
fcc
had
to
read
the
public
interest
standard
in
the
communications
act
as
if
it
incorporated
the
policy
of
section
504.
the
fcc
thus
was
ordered
independently
to
decide
kcet's
section
504
compliance
as
part
of
the
license
renewal
proceedings
at
the
fcc.
the
narrow
issue
this
court
agreed
to
review
is
whether
that
novel
incorporation
theory
is
a
legally
correct
interpretation
of
the
intent
of
congress.
we
say
it
is
not.
the
mandatory
incorporation
theory
is
at
war
with
this
court's
holding
that
the
fcc
has
very
broad
discretion
to
decide
the
scope
of
the
public
interest
standard.
we
have
found
no
holding
by
this
court
suggesting
that
the
fcc
must
automatically
read
into
the
public
interest
standard
policies
expressed
by
the
congress
in
other
statutes.
the
fcc
is
not
required
to
incorporate
the
policy
of
another
law
unless
the
congress
directs
it.
of
course,
the
fcc
may
and
often
does
consider
the
policies
of
other
statutes
when
it
determines
the
scope
of
the
public
interest
standard
in
the
communications
act,
but
that
is
an
initial
judgment
that
the
congress
entrusted
to
the
fcc.
the
fcc
exhibited
leadership
concerning
television
for
the
deaf.
the
court
of
appeals
acted
as
if
the
fcc
had
done
nothing.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
yes,
it
would.
the
fcc
takes
into
account
findings
by
other
agencies
or
courts
of
violations
of
law
by
its
licensees.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
i
don't
recall
immediately
a
case
about
an
unfair
labor
practice,
but
they
would
look
to
see
to
what
extent
that
judicial
or
other
agency
finding
indicated
a
character
trait
on
the
part
of
the
licensee
that
suggested
it
undeserving
to
be
licensed.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
fcc
initially
would
look
at
the
nature
of
the
allegations,
how
well
they
were
supported
by
specific
facts,
affidavits,
and
so
on,
but
i
suspect
that
the
most
that
the
fcc
would
do
in
that
situation
is
simply
wait
to
see
what
one
of
the
enforcement
agencies
would
do.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
they
would
say
that
it
was
irrelevant.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
no,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
law.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
no,
they
did
not.
they
said
that
they
were
going
to
wait
until--
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
--no,
they
said
it
was
relevant,
and
that
they
would
take
into
account
any
adjudication
by
a
responsible
agency
that
there
had
been
discrimination
or
violation
of
section
504.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
well,
i
am
stumbling
over
the
word
"irrelevant".
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
well,
they
had--
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
--but
they
had
evidence
before
it
of
what
the
station
was
doing
in
terms
of
service
to
the
deaf,
and
it
decided
that
apart
from
a
specific
finding
by
a
funding
agency
that
there
was
some
problem
under
504,
that
the
commission
under
its
view
of
the
public
interest
standard
found
no
shortcoming.
it
noted
specifically
in
its
opinion
that
the
station
had
been
providing
programs
for
the
deaf.
it
noted
specifically
that
there
was
a
controversy
over
the
scheduling
of
those
programs,
but
consistent
with
its
historic
views
on
scheduling
questions,
said,
no
problem,
as
far
as
the
public
interest
standard
is
concerned.
for
eight
or
nine
years
before
the
commission
acted
on
the
respondent's
complaints
here,
and
beginning
well
before
enactment
of
section
504,
the
fcc
had
been
focusing
on
the
question
of
television
for
the
deaf.
it
did
not
advocate
its
responsibilities
in
proceeding
as
it
did,
for
it
balanced
the
conflicting
interests
of
the
deaf
and
the
hearing
audiences.
it
studied
the
evolving
technology.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
as
far
as
the
published
opinions
go,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
no
indication
that
they
specifically
took
into
account
a
statute
called
section
504.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
not
as
far
as
i
recall,
but
after
its
enactment
it
did
on
several
occasions
before
it
resolved
this
case
deal
with
the
subject
of
television
service
for
the
deaf.
it
was
authorizing
experiments
on
this
new
captioning
technology.
after
those
had
progressed,
it
actually
authorized
regular
operations
with
the
new
technology,
and
it
was
continuing
to
observe
the
problem,
study
the
question,
and
it
continued,
though,
to
pronounce
its
decision
that
it
did
not
feel
that
under
all
of
the
circumstances
things
were
far
enough
along
to
warrant
a
mandatory
obligation
by
television
stations
to
do
any
particular
thing
for
the
deaf,
though
it
encouraged
them
to
do
what
they
could.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
precisely.
i
think
that
the
fcc
was
out
in
front
of
the
congress
and
in
front
of
the
national
policy
in
terms
of
television
for
the
deaf,
for
it
started
to
deal
with
this
question
in
1970,
three
years
before
there
was
such
a
thing
as
the
rehabilitation
act.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
somewhat
ambiguous.
on
the
one
hand,
there
is
language
that
says,
now,
we
are
leaving
this
up
to
you,
fcc.
you
fill
in
the
interstices
of
this
requirement.
but
by
the
same
token,
there
was
language
in
the
opinion
that
says,
we
expect
you
to
do
something
about
this
now.
we
expect
stations
to
do
this,
and
in
the
light
of
the
record
where
kcet
had
shown
that
it
had
done
extensive
things,
one
can
only
wonder
if
the
court
of
appeals
wasn't
saying
that
we
are
requiring
you,
fcc,
to
order
these
stations
to
take
some
kinds
of
affirmative
action
that
they
have
not
taken
up
until
now.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
yes,
it
would
be.
the
fcc
looks
into
all
sorts
of
things,
but
employment
of
women
and
minorities
is
one
of
the
things
they
look
at.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
well,
the
fcc
had
said
in
1970
and
again
in
1976
that
we
are
not
going
to
impose
any
specific
obligations
because
this
whole
question
of
television
service
for
the
deaf
is
wrapped
up
in
technology
and
economics
and
other
practical
problems.
therefore,
we
are
not
going
to
mandate
some
specific
actions.
so
that
pleadings
saying
that
a
station
had
only
done
x
amount
of
programming
for
the
deaf
would
not
run
afoul
of
any
stated
policy,
any
standard,
any
guideline
that
the
fcc
had
laid
down.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
well,
that
is
correct,
but--
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
--well,
the
commission
evaluates
the
factual
allegations
and
the
record
of
the
station,
and
it
decides
whether
in
its
view
of
the
public
interest,
whether
it
takes
into
account
fully
the
provision
of
some
other
statute
or
only
partially.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
it
did
not
so
state
that.
it
said
that
it
was
not
the
enforcement
agency
for
504,
and
that
until
an
enforcement
agency
had
ruled
kcet
to
have
discriminated,
there
was
nothing
for
it
to
evaluate,
bearing
in
mind
again
that
it
was
satisfied
that
the
station
had
done
for
the
deaf
all
the
things
that
the
fcc
had
been
saying
that
the
deaf
were
entitled
to
have.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
justice
stevens,
the
respondents
here
asked
the
fcc
to
deny
kcet's
license
because
it
was
not
broadcasting
with
open
captions
all
of
its
programs.
that
was
their
complaint.
that
was
the
relief
that
they
sought.
now,
as
far
as
what--
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
--the
record,
i
think,
does
not
show
that,
your
honor,
but
the
point
is,
justice
white,
that
kcet
did
everything
that
the
fcc
had
said
in
its
policy
statements
it
was
going
to
require.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
he
is
incorrect.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
the
only
thing
the
fcc
said
it
was
going
to
require
stations
to
do--
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
--well,
all
right.
first
we
will
take
require.
was
emergency
messages.
there
is
not
an
allegation
anywhere
that
kcet
failed
to
do
that.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
the
suggestions
were
that
the
faces
of
newscasters
be
present
on
the
screen,
that
scores
of
games
be
given
visually.
kcet
didn't
broadcast
any
games.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
i
think
not.
they
are
supposed
to
be
educational.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
no,
the
question,
i
guess,
is,
would
they
violate
their
license
if
they
didn't
broadcast
one.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
after
a
day
and
a
half
of
trial
in
federal
district
court
in
california,
the
judge
dismissed
the
complaint
against
kcet,
the
complaint
of
discrimination,
on
the
ground
that
there
had
been
no
proof
of
discrimination.
we
didn't
even
have
to
put
on
our
defense.
and...
thank
you.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
well,
i
was
going
to
another
point.
i
had
finished
that
one.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
wonderful.
mr.
edgar
f.
czarra,
jr.
the
only
express
suggestions
were
the
ones
that
i
enumerated,
emergency
bulletins,
focusing
on
the
face
of
people
so
that
lipreading
would
be
permissible,
and
giving
scores
in
writing.
