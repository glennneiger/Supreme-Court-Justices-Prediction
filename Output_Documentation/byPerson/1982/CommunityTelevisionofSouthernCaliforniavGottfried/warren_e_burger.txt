chief
justice

e.

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
community
television
against
gottfried.
mr.
czarra,
i
think
you
may
begin
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
alito?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
don't
agree
with
your
colleague,
who
suggested
that
the
employment
policies
of
the
licensee
are
relevant
factors
in
the
license
renewal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
it
affect
the
listeners?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
the
employment
practice
of
technicians,
stenographers,
salesmen,
et
cetera,
have
any
bearing
on
what
goes
out
over
the
air?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
i
am
confused
by
your
other
response
that
these...
i
thought
you
were
indicating
that
the
enforcement
of
these
other
statutory
duties
entrusted
to
other
agencies
was
left
to
them,
and
not
to
be
taken
on
by
the
fcc.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
could
be
a
greater
enforcement
mechanism
than
the
threat
of
losing
a
television
license?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
far
more
serious
than
an
order
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
or
the
eeoc,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
you
may
continue,
mr.
alito.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
frequently
in
our
opinions
and
questions
we
refer
to
the
alleged
expertise,
the
accumulated
experience
of
these
regulatory
agencies.
isn't
that
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
account,
whether,
as
justice
rehnquist
suggested,
this
is
a
primary
responsibility
of
the
fcc,
to
delve
into
a
subject
where
another
agency
has
total
control?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
firestone.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
this
court
or
any
court,
for
example,
which
is
open
to
the
public
does
not
provide
amplifying
equipment
so
that
people
who
are
hard
of
hearing
either
can't
follow
the
proceedings
or
have
great
difficulty,
is
that
a
discrimination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
must
it?
that
is
the
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--do
i
understand
your
answer
that
it
is
not
discriminatory
not
to
provide
caption,
immediate
translation
of
everything
that
is
going
on
here
for
the
benefit
of
the
audience?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
generally.
the
term
discrimination
isn't
limited
to
this
statute.
it
is
a
broad
term.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
our
license
can't
be
cancelled
by
anyone.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
hypothetical
questions
were
put
to
you
in
your
use
of
the
word
"discrimination".
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
is
not
limited
to
504
or
any
other
statute.
it
is
a
very
broad
term.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
this
court
has
said
countless
times,
and
other
courts
have,
that
these
regulatory
agencies
have
broad,
very
broad
discretion
as
to
what
they
will
weigh
and
take
into
account.
now,
if
an
agency
has
exercised
that
discretion
and
come
up
with
what
someone
regards
as
a
wrong
decision,
isn't
the
review
of
that
decision
limited
to
an
abuse
of
discretion,
not
a
matter
of
a
court
of
appeals
deciding
that
it
should
have
been
done
some
other
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
suggest
there
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
here
on
the
part
of
the
agency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
an
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
commission's
part
because
it
decided
to
defer
to
an
agency
which
has
a
life
or
death
control
over
a
public
television
station,
life
or
death
control
by
virtue
of
the
grants.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
the
grants
have
a
lot
to
do...
perhaps
life
and
death
isn't
quite
it,
but
they
can
shut
off
the
supply
of
blood,
can't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
grant
agency
doesn't
always
just
inflict
a
death
blow
right
away.
they
inform
the
grantee
or
the
prospective
grantee
that
if
they
don't
do
certain
things,
then
their
grant
will
be
cut
off.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
the
real
control
over
this
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
an
agency,
or
what
kind
of
a
licensee
do
we
have
here?
do
we
have
one
who
got
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
they
don't
play
ball
according
to
the
views
of
that
agency,
they
aren't
going
to
get
any
more
money.
isn't
that
the
prospect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
the
statutory
scheme?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
that
issue
settled
in
united
church
of
christ
against
wlbt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
a
clear
case
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
the
united
church
of
christ
case,
it
was
50
or
60
percent
of
the
audience
that
was
being
discriminated
against.
what
percentage
of
the
audience
total
is
involved
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
czarra.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
justice
stevens
has
the
announcement
of
judgments
and
opinion
in
two
cases.
