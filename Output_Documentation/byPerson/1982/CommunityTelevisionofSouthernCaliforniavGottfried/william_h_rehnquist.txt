mr.
czarra,
do
you
have
any
idea
whether
the
fcc
at
the
license
renewal
stage
would
take
into
consideration
the
fact,
if
there
were
a
fact,
that
a
licensee
had
been
found
to
be
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
it
do
if
it
found
that
a
licensee
had
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
an
intervenor
in
a
license
renewal
proceeding,
if
that
is
what
you
call
them,
someone
objecting
to
the
license
renewal,
said,
i
think
this
station
has
been
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
is
true,
the
nlrb
has
never
passed
on
it.
would
the
fcc
undertake
to
determine
that
for
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
evidence
is
offered
that
out
of
the
300
employees,
there
are
only
3
percent
that
include
minorities,
hispanics,
orientals,
negroes,
et
cetera?
is
that
relevant
to
the
issue
before
the
commission
on
the
renewal
of
the
license?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
thought
there
is
that
the
commission
may
take
into
consideration
some
policies
from
other
statutes
as
a
part
of
the
public
interest
standard
on
its
own
initiative,
although
had
it
declined
to
do
so,
the
court
of
appeals
couldn't
compel
it
to
do
so.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
in
the
particular
case
that
we
are
talking
about,
it
is
the
commission's
position
that
it
couldn't
have
been
required
to
consider
employment
discrimination
if
it
had
chosen
not
to,
if
that
had
been
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
way
the
504
situation
was
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
insofar
as
504
is
concerned,
isn't
it
a
fairly
orthodox
application
of
primary
jurisdiction
on
behalf
of
one
agency
for
another?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
congress
hasn't
yet
passed
a
law
deciding
which
agency
should
be
responsible,
isn't
that
an
indication
of
some
go
slow
attitude
on
congress's
part--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--until
that
law
is
passed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
whom?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
hold
that
the
agency
was
not
entitled
as
a
matter
of
its
discretion
to
defer
to
the
other
agency
which
had
primary
responsibility
for
enforcing
504.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
correct,
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
your
answer
yes
or
no?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
firestone,
do
you
think
it
is
crystal
clear
that
this
television
station
and
the
programming
it
presents
is
"a
program
or
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
"
under
the
terms
of
504--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
that
it
would
have
no
defense
to
an
action,
say,
if
the
appropriate
agency
brought
it
in
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean,
held
by
everyone?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
some
of
them
judges?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
station
make
some
defense
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
was
not
subject
to
this
provision,
that
it
had
a
statutory
exemption
from
program
control
or
something
to
that
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we
get
back
to
your
contention
that
all
these
things
ought
to
be
originally
thrashed
out
before
the
fcc,
does
that
really
make
much
sense,
if
it
is
deciding
a
fairly
complicated
question
of...
wouldn't
you
want
the
agency
charged
with
the
statutory
mandate
whose
administrative
interpretation
would
be
entitled
to
considerable
weight
to
make
those
kind
of
determinations
in
the
first
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
that
case,
the
commission
should
take
into
consideration
the
antitrust
laws
on
its
own
motion?
it
wasn't
forced
to
by
a
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
the
national
labor
relations
board,
wasn't
it?
