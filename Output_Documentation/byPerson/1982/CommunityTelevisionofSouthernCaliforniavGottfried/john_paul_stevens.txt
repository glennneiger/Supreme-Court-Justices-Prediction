justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
alito,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
particular
problem
that
this
case
raises?
as
i
understand
it,
this
is
a
license
renewal
proceeding,
and
mrs.
gottfried
objected
to
the
renewal
of
the
license,
and
filed
an
objection
to
the
renewal
which
was
later
supported
by
some
kind
of
an
affidavit.
is
that
right?
and
what
i
want
to
know
is,
where
is
the
affidavit
in
the
papers?
what
is
it
that
she
has
filed
on
which
she
did
not
get
a
hearing?
i
can't
find
it
in
the
papers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
specific
question
first
is,
where
can
i
find
it
in
the
papers?
do
you
know?
her
claim,
or
her
submission.
her
submission
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
is
not
in
the
appendix
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
then,
what
was
her
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
insufficient
according
to
what
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
she
did
get
a
hearing
on
the
second
charge
she
made?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question?
because
i
have
a
lot
of
difficulty
with
abstract
problems,
as
this
seems
to
be.
did
she
in
her
paper
allege
specific
facts
that
she
said
constituted
a
violation
of
a
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
essentially,
what
facts
did
she
allege?
basically,
what
did
she
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so,
could
it
be
said
that
by
denying
a
hearing,
that
the
fcc
said...
ruled,
in
effect,
that
those
allegations,
even
if
true,
do
not
constitute
a
violation
of
that
statute,
or
is
it
better
to
say
they
don't
care
whether
it
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
statute?
which
is
their
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
like
saying
they
don't
care
unless
some
other
agency
finds
there
to
be
a
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
firestone,
that
makes
me...
i
hate
to
interrupt
you,
and
maybe
i
shouldn't,
but
i
really
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
relief
that
you
think
your
client
is
entitled
to.
you
were
objecting
to
the
renewal
of
the
license,
which
i
take
it
means
that
had
you
won,
the
license
renewal
would
have
been
denied.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
the
relief
that
you
requested,
a
denial
of
the
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
what
you
requested?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
that
isn't
what
you
really
wanted,
what
did
you
want?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
want
something
specific
with
respect
to
this
particular
station,
or
do
you
want
a
general
rule
to
apply
to
all
stations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
have
to
decide
a
lawsuit,
you
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
judge
mcgowan
said
they
ought
to
proceed
by
rulemaking,
and
therefore
you
should
lose
in
this
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is
it...
i
still
don't...
i
have...
it
is
a
very
strange
case
for
me,
because
the
pleadings
are
not
before
us,
and
that
is
what
we
are
arguing
about,
the
sufficiency
of
your
pleadings.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
you
want.
i
know
you
would
like
the
commission
to
do
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
an
objection
to
a
license
renewal
an
appropriate
way
to
get
the
commission
to
adopt
a
rule?
isn't
that
what
you
really
want,
is
a
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
should
they
deny
this
applicant's
license
in
order
to
give
you
a
guideline?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
treat
this
licensee
any
differently
than
any
other
licensee,
according
to
your
allegations?
do
you
allege
this
station
operates
differently
than
any
other
public
station
does?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
unique
to
this
station?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
any
station
uses
captioning
in
all
its
programs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
first
--
the
first
of
the
two
cases
i
have
to
announced,
community
television
of
southern
california
against
gottfried,
arises
out
of
a
license
renewal
proceeding
before
the
federal
communications
commission.
respondent,
a
person
with
impaired
hearing,
objected
to
the
renewal
of
petitioner's
license
to
operate
a
public
television
station
and
also
objected
to
the
renewal
of
seven
commercial
television
station
licenses
on
the
ground
that
they
had
not
provided
adequate
programming
for
the
very
substantial
segment
of
the
public
that
suffers
from
impaired
hearing.
the
commission
ultimately
overruled
respondent's
objections
and
renewed
the
licenses
of
all
eight
stations.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
by
a
divided
vote,
held
that
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973
requires
that
a
more
strict
standard
be
applied
to
the
renewal
of
a
public
television
station
and
to
a
commercial
station
and
remanded
the
case
for
further
proceedings
before
the
commission.
we
granted
certiorari
and
for
reason
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
have
concluded
that
the
public
interest
factors
that
justify
a
renewal
of
the
seven
commercial
licenses
also
should
lead
to
the
same
result
for
the
public
television
station.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
