mr.
czarra,
did
the
fcc
take
any
new
action
after
the
adoption
of
section
504,
or
was
its
policy
already
fixed?
did
it
reconsider
it
and
determine
that
what
it
had
already
done
met
the
requirements
of
504
to
the
extent
that
it
was
relevant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
never
mentioned
it
by
number
or
name?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
we
were
to
determine
that
the
act,
section
504,
is
relevant
to
the
purposes
and
things
which
the
fcc
has
to
decide
in
some
way,
i
take
it
it
is
your
position
that
the
fcc
has
taken
action
and
has
applied
the
principles
embodied
in
504.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
impose
any
special
burdens
on
the
agency
other
than
to
require
it
to
make
tracks,
so
to
speak,
indicating
its
consideration
of
the
section?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
make
the
same
argument
on
equal
employment
opportunity,
for
example,
that
the
fcc
should
not
concern
itself
whatever
with
that
in
license
renewals?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
think
the
fcc
has
determined
that
service
to
the
hearing
impaired
is
relevant
to
its
license
renewal
application?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
an
erroneous
decision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
your
argument,
counsel,
seems
to
go
beyond
that
of
the
station
itself.
the
station
says
the
fcc
recognized
the
relevance
of
the
policies
behind
504,
and
it
has
made
an
appropriate
response
at
the
present
time,
and
you
are
saying
that
there
was
no
obligation
at
all
on
the
part
of
fcc
to
even
recognize
those
policies.
that
seems
to
me
perhaps
not
necessary
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
understood
that
the
commission
had
stated
that
it
did
encourage
experimentation
with
technology
by
stations
about
this
problem,
and
that
it
actually
issued
a
warning
that
it
would
consider
imposition
of
mandatory
requirements
if
it
determined
in
the
future
that
the
voluntary
efforts
were
not
satisfactory.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here
really
to
quarrel
with
the
fcc's
determination
of
public
interest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
in
the
public
interest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
the
fcc
also
required
that
all
emergency
messages
be
visually
transmitted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
said
that
if
the
agency
charged
with
primary
enforcement
of
504
determines
there
is
a
violation,
it
will
take
that
into
account?
