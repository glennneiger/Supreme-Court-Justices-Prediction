chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
olim
against
wakinekona.
mr.
lilly,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
always
involves
a
balancing
of
all
the
interests,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
lilly.
mr.
lilly,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
alternative
would
have
been
to
put
him
in
solitary
confinement,
create
a
special
cell
somewhere
and
put
him
in
solitary
confinement
permanently.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
any
prisons...
you
said
there
were
prisons
on
a
number
of
the
islands
in
the
chain.
how
many
all
together,
roughly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
big
islands.
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
johnston.
mr.
johnston,
before
you
start,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
there
were
no
regulations
at
all.
he
is
just
in
prison
under
a
valid
sentence,
and
then
all
the
other
events
took
place.
is
there
any
kind
of...
is
there
any
constitutional
right
to
any
particular
process
before
he
is
transferred?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
there
any
regulations
or
any
controlling
state
law
in
vitek?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
not
think
there
is
some
difference
between
being
transferred
from
an
institution
of
pure
confinement,
that
is,
a
prison,
and
to
a
mental
institution,
different
from
being
transferred
from
one
classification
of
prison
to
another?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
those
words,
that
language
must
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
facts
of
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
hawaii
had
another...
i
don't
know
how...
what's
the
sweep
of
the
islands.
how
many
miles
is
it,
500,
or
300,
or
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
assume
that
the
only
maximum
prison
was
300
miles
away
from
honolulu,
and
he
was...
would
you
say
that
the
same
constitutional
factors
were
raised
if
he
was
transferred
to
the
only
maximum
security
institution
available
350
miles
away?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
not
as
difficult,
but
it
would
be
certainly
difficult
for
family
to
make
visits,
would
it
not,
350
miles?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
of
appeals
hasn't
decided
a
question
which
he
raised.
is
that
your
basis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
is
a
constitutional
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
on
which
any
court
at
this
stage
could
pass
on
the
claims
of
bias?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
complaint.
i
am
talking
about
evidence.
what
evidence
was
presented
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
district
court
make
any
findings
on
that
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
could
not
rely
on
that
issue
in
this
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals,
absent
some
evidence,
could
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
but
it
can't
be
resolved
here
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
with
finality--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--because
there
is
a
limited
amount
of
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
would
be
your
position,
again,
on
an
interisland
transfer
if
it
were
350
miles
apart?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
he
had
been
assigned
to
that
prison
by
the
state
of
hawaii
in
the
first
instance
on
the
ground
that
they
had
no
facilities
adequate
to
take
care
of
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
lilly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
somewhat
a
parallel
to
the
grievance
procedures
in
labor
relations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
try
to
resolve
these
matters
at
the
lowest
level
possible
on
the
way
up?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
olim
against
wakinekona
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
