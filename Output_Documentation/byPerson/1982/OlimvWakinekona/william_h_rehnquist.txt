justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lilly,
in
reading
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
i
had
some
difficulty,
because
i
couldn't
find
any
place
where
the
rules
were
set
out.
can
you
tell
me
somewhere
in
the
briefs
or
appendix
where
these
rules
they
were
talking
about
are
set
out?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lilly,
what
is
the
doctrine
you
say
you
think
has
little
vitality
after
meachum?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
the
decisions
from
this
court,
maybe
some
have
avoided
use
of
the
term
and
some
haven't,
perhaps
just
because
of
its
vagueness,
but
in
a
sense
hawaii
has
brought
its
problems
on
itself
here.
i
mean,
these
regulations
one
might
think
were
perhaps
drawn
by
a
social
worker,
but
they
do
use
the
term
"grievous
loss".
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
he
complains
about
being
transferred,
but
he
doesn't
complain
about
the
decision
to
transfer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
been
bothered,
and
perhaps
my
colleagues
don't
share
this
trouble,
by
the
kind
of
generality
of
the
discussion
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
and
a
little
bit
by
the
character
of
the...
kind
of...
as
opposed
to
focusing
down
on
just
what
was
involved
in
this
particular
case.
as
i
understand
it,
reading
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
the
prisoner
complains
that
the
panel
of
the
board
or
the
board
that
made
the
recommendation
to
transfer
was
biased,
and
your
answer
is
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
it
was
biased?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
give
him
any--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
i
thought
his
claim
of
bias
was
just,
it
was
the
same
tribunal
that
had
had
this
hearing--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
they
already
knew
more
about
him
than
maybe
he
wanted
them
to
know.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
still
think
that
there
is
some
problem
with
the
way
you
state
the
thing,
and
maybe
the
fault
isn't
yours,
but
somewhere
else
down
there.
maybe
the
fault
is
mine.
but
i
presume
that
even
though
there
is
not
any
right
to
be
free
of
an
interstate
transfer,
that
is,
the
fact
you
are
being
transferred
by
itself
doesn't
give
rise
to
any
constitutional
claim,
if
hawaii
regulations
provide
that
you
shall
have
a
hearing
before
you
are
transferred,
and
the...
it
doesn't
say
anything
more
than,
you
will
just
have
a
hearing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
require
any
finding
of
fact
or
anything
like
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
nonetheless,
a
hearing
is
required,
and
you
have
a
right
to
appear
before
them.
and
if
you
could
show
that
the
board
was
in
fact
biased,
that
is...
take
an
extreme
case...
that
the
prison
administrator
had
paid
one
of
the
members
of
the
board
$100
to
decide...
to
vote
to
transfer
this
person,
would
you
say
that
didn't
raise
any
constitutional
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
what
you
are
really
arguing
is
that
there
wasn't
bias
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
i
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
support
you
in
that,
but
i
think
if
you
have
a...
you
can
have
a
constitutionally
biased
finder
of
fact
that
passes
on
non-constitutional
questions,
and
you
nonetheless
might
have
a
constitutional
issue.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
internally
consistent?
because
in
places
it
talks
about
this
bias
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
would
agree
that
the
questions
presented
to
us
on
review
of
the
ninth
circuit
simply
don't
involve
that
issue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we
should
assume
that
the
tribunal
which
did
pass
on
this
thing
was
totally
unprejudiced?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
we
have
to
somewhat
segregate
the
issue
that
is
before
us
for
decision.
we
can't
take
into
consideration
in
deciding
the
issue
you
say
is
here
your
other
allegation
that
the
tribunal
was
biased.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
would
certainly
leave
that
open
in
any
decision
we
rendered,
i
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
that
extent,
and
to
the
extent
of
a
statutory
scheme
or,
you
know,
things
peculiar
to
the
hawaii
system
that
courts
not
in
hawaii
might
not
be
familiar
with,
i
should
think
the
best
authority
on
that
is
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii,
and
they
have
spoken
on
the
question,
haven't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
should
be
read
in
conjunction.
if
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
was
willing
to
read
rule
4
by
itself,
i
presume
it
thought
that
the
other
rules
didn't
have
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
page?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
could
be
just
kind
of
a
joint
right
of
allocation,
kind
of
a
best
interest
hearing,
where
everybody...
anybody
affected
is
entitled
to
be
heard,
but
it
is
totally
discretionary
with
the
deciding
authority.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
folsome
have
a
prison
advocacy
group
and
social
workers
surrounding
it?
i
mean,
isn't
he
transferred
to
folsome?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
mean,
you
say,
no
access
to
counsel.
i
mean,
don't
most
prisons
have
a
legal
advocacy
group--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
you
can
say
the
same
thing
in
southern
california.
a
prisoner
might
have
access
to
workers
trained
to
deal
with
spanish-speaking
people,
because
there
are
so
many
in
southern
california.
if
he
is
transferred
to
a
correctional
center
in
springfield,
missouri,
he
probably
won't,
but
i
don't
think
the
distinction
turns
on
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
johnston,
you
don't
need
to
show
the
deprivation
of
a
constitutionally
protected
liberty
interest
in
order
to
show
that
you
may
be
entitled
to
an
unbiased
tribunal,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
has
really
balled
up
this
whole
thing,
if
you
will
pardon
me
for
saying
so,
because
i
think
that
it
is
very
indistinct
just
what
the
parties
are
arguing
about.
do
you
concede
that
you
would
have
to
show
a
protected
liberty
interest
is
at
stake
in
the
hearing
before
the
tribunal
before
you
can
complain
of
a
constitutionally
biased
tribunal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
may
have
spoken
too
hastily.
assume
that
you
have
the
kind
of
situation
in
meachum
against
fano,
where
the
court
says
that
although
you
may
have...
there
may
have
been
a
process
for
some
sort
of
a
hearing,
nonetheless
there
was
no
substantive
standard,
no
deprivation
of
any
liberty
interest,
just
in
the
transfer
from
one
prison
within
a
state
to
the
other.
now,
supposing
you
end
up
coupling
that...
the
allegation
that
would
lose
under
meachum
against
fano
with
an
allegation
that
the
prison
administrator
had
to
make
some
sort
of
a
finding
was
constitutionally
biased
against
you.
now,
does
that
get
you
into
the
constitutional
ball
park,
so
to
speak?
it
is
not
life.
it
is
not
liberty.
it
is
not
property.
i
may
have
been
too
hasty
in
suggesting
before
that
i
thought
there
was
a
difference.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
order
to
guarantee
an
unbiased
tribunal
it
would
be
a
constitutional
dimension.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
isn't--
--the
same
author
wrote
both
of
them,
didn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
right
of
allocution,
which
is
strictly
a
procedural
rule?
i
don't
think
it
imparts
any
substantive
right
at
all.
a
prisoner
can
appear
before
the
sentencing
authority,
the
judge,
and
you
know,
talk
for
30
minutes,
and
there
is
no
substantive
contact
that
needs
come
out
of
that
from
the
judge
at
all.
he
can
still
give
exactly
the
same
sentence
as
he
would
have
before.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
form
of
therapy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
it
is
just
kind
of
a
charade?
