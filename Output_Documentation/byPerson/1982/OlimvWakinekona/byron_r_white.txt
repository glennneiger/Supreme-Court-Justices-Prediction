how
would
you
know
what
the
result
would

before
a

kind
of

tribunal?
justice
byron

would
you
think
there
are
any
senior
staff
members
eligible
to
sit
on
this
process
who
would
not
generally
know
about
this
fellow's
record

wouldn't
be

liberty

justice

you
were
denied

the
meaning
of
the

suppose.
justice

i
guess
the
claim
in

is
that
they

vitek
didn't
rest
just
on
the
substantiality
of
the
change

did
it?

but
that
isn't
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
proceeded--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
the
issue
here
is
violation
of
state
procedures,
is
a
withholding
of

justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
went
strictly
on
the
liberty
interest
created
by
state
law.
justice
byron

white
you
were
entitled
to
ask
for
affirmance
on
another
ground,
even
if
you
lost
on
it
below
and
didn't
cross
appeal
or
anything.
you
could
ask
for
affirmance
on
another
ground,
as
long
as
it
is
supported
by
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
claim,
that
is
not
on
the...
on
a
claim
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
has
been
violated
because
you
have
been
deprived
of
your
life,
your
liberty,
or
your
property,
and
probably
your
liberty,
without
due
process
of
law.

yes,

[generallaughter.]
you
really
can't
sustain
that
unless
you
answer
the
chief
justice's
question
a
while
ago
a
certain
way.
suppose
there
weren't
any
regulations,
and
there
was
just
a
transfer
to
a
mainland
prison
from
hawaii,
and
you
come
in
and
say,
well,
transferring
interstate
when
it
has
these
consequences
is
such...
is
just
not
within
the
contemplation
of
a
sentence.
it
is
just
not
the
kind
of
a
thing
that
a
person
in
prison
should
have
to
contemplate.
that
is
the
basis
vitek
proceeded
on.
now,
are
you
suggesting
that
an
interstate
transfer
is
just
out
of
bounds,
without
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
agree,
you
have
to
say
that
it
is
just
out
of
bounds
in
the
sense
that
no
prison
administrator
should
contemplate
making
this
kind
of
a
transfer
without
a
hearing,
whether
there
are
regulations
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
make
that
point
to
rely
on
vitek.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
not
the
basis
the
court
of
appeals
went
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
bound
to
have
to
mix
your
procedural
argument
with
a
substantive
argument,
aren't
you?
you
might...
you
could
have...
give
you
all
the
process
you
wanted,
and
then
just
transfer
you,
but
then
you
are
bound
to
then
have
to
say,
well,
the
reasons
weren't
good
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
isn't
really
a
procedural--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
think
you
could
shame
them
into
not
transferring
if
you
had
some
procedures?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
talk
them
into--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
read
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
as
resting
on
a
decision
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
under
state
law,
and
surely
that
if
he
had
a
right
to
a
hearing,
he
ought
to
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
by
an
unbiased
decision-maker.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
you
interpret
it
then
that
here
is
the
state
imposing
substantial
hardships
on
him
by
a
decision
of
a
biased
decision-maker.
