mr.
michael
a.
lilly
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
state-created
pretransfer
procedures
prior
to
an
interstate
transfer
of
an
inmate
implicate
a
liberty
interest
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
believe
that
the
court
should
not
so
broaden
the
concepts
of
the
due
process
clause
to
so
extend
it
to
mere
procedures
prior
to
interstate
transfer
where
there
is
no
underlying
substantive
liberty
interest
at
stake.
now,
delbert
kaahanui
wakinekona
is
a
maximum
control,
maximum
security
inmate
of
the
hawaii
prison
system.
he
is
serving
multiple
terms
for
crimes
including
life
without
parole
for
murder
in
1970.
he
was
in
1976
an
inmate
of
the
maximum
control
unit
of
the
hawaii
state
prison.
the
maximum
control
unit
was
a
prison
within
the
hawaii
state
prison
system,
a
small
prison
with
its
own
programs,
with
its
own
walls
within
the
institution
to
house
maximum
security
type
inmates.
on
august
2,
1976,
there
was
a
series
of
hearings
conducted
by
what
is
called
the
program
committee,
which
is
not
unlike
the
type
of
committees
you
see
in
almost
every
prison
system
throughout
the
land,
to
ascertain
why
the
programs
within
the
maximum
control
unit
had
failed.
mr.
wakinekona,
along
with
every
other
inmate
of
the
maximum
control
unit,
were
interviewed.
subsequently,
the
same
committee
provided
notice
to
mr.
wakinekona
that
within
five
days
they
would
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
his
classification
within
the
system
should
be
altered,
and
whether
or
not
he
should
be
transferred
to
another
part
of
the
prison
system,
another
prison
within
hawaii,
or
transferred
interstate.
a
hearing
was
held
before
this
committee.
he
was
represented
by
an
attorney.
he
was
provided
opportunity
to
respond
to
all
of
the
provisions
set
forth
in
the
notice.
he
was
advised
why
they
were
considering
certain
actions
about
him.
and
ultimately,
after
the
hearing
was
concluded,
he
received
a
notice
of
recommendations
on
his
security
classification
that
it
should
remain
as
maximum,
that
he
continued
to
be
a
security
risk
within
the
hawaii
prison
system,
and
that
because
of
major
changes
that
were
going
to
be
undertaken
by
the
system,
and
that
is,
to
terminate
the
maximum
control
unit,
pending
construction
of
the
state
of
hawaii's
new
master
plan,
master
correctional
plan,
that
because
there
would
be
no
programs
available
in
hawaii
for
maximum
control
inmates,
there
would
be
no
institution
set
up
for
maximum
control
type
inmates,
that
they
recommended
that
mr.
wakinekona
be
transferred
to
a
mainland
facility.
that
recommendation
was
followed
by
the
administrator,
the
final
decision-maker
under
rule
4
of
our
rules,
mr.
antone
olim,
who
made
the
decision
to
transfer
mr.
wakinekona
to
folsome
prison
in
california--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--the
rules
are
attached
in
the
joint
appendix.
they
are
attached
to
the
complaint
as
an
exhibit.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
and
if
you
will
read
in
the...
those
rules
provide
two
basic
processes
that
are
addressed.
there
is
an
adjustment
process
in
hawaii
for
your
traditional
disciplinary
type
actions,
where
the
committee
makes
actual
decisions
to
punish
inmates
based
upon
substantial
evidence
of
rule
violations.
that
is
to
be
contrasted
with
the
program
committee
process,
which
is
under
the
classification
process,
where
they
review
every
inmate
within
the
system
on
an
ongoing
basis
to
determine
where
that
person
best
fits
within
the
prison
system,
to
determine
what
kind
of
classification
he
should
have,
and
where
he
should
be
housed
within
the
system.
it
is
a
continuing...
it
is
described,
the
classification
process
is
described
in
its
purpose
as
a
dynamic
process
that
provides
a
continuing
evaluation
of
every
inmate
based
upon
a
multiplicity
of
factors,
one
committed
basically
to
the
discretion
of
the
officials.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
when
mr.
wakinekona
goes
to
folsome,
then
he
comes
under
the
programs
and
the
operation
of
the
folsome
prison
system.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
he
would
be
the
same
as
a
folsome
inmate
if
he
went
to
folsome,
as
he
did.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
there
is
no
question
that
when
you
have
an
interstate
transfer,
that
it
makes
it
more
onerous.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
i
agree
with
you
that
it
presents
different
situations,
except
it
is
not
unlike,
for
example,
the
court's
consideration
in
the
howe
versus
smith
case
last
session,
in
which
an
inmate
was
transferred
from
vermont
to
the
federal
prison
in
georgia.
it
is
also
not
unlike--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--it's...
if
i
may
say...
i
agree
with
that.
we
have
a
much
more
difficult
opportunity
for
inmates
to...
for
visitation
interstate,
but
it
is
also
not
unlike
this
court's
reversal,
vacation
in
howe
versus
maderis
last
session,
in
light
of
howe,
in
which
three
of
our
inmates
had
been
transferred
to
a
federal
prison
system
in
marion,
illinois.
it
is
not
unusual
that
inmates
will
be
transferred
interstate.
it
is
not
unusual
that
an
inmate
from
alaska
would
be
transferred
anywhere
within
the
united
states.
it
is
not
unusual
for
hawaii
inmates
to
be
transferred
interstate.
it
is
within
the
contemplation
of
the
sentence
of--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--it
is
a
very
delicate
balancing.
we
don't
do
it
so
often,
because
it
is
very
expensive,
but
when
we
do
it,
we
do
it
because
there
are
necessary
considerations,
and
in
this
case,
with
mr.
wakinekona,
there
would
be
absolutely
no
place
for
him
within
the
hawaii
prison
system
with
the
termination
of
the
maximum
security
unit.
he
would
basically
be
placed
in
a
cell,
and
would
have
no
opportunity
for
any
kind
of
programming.
once
his
status
was
remained
at
maximum,
there
was
simply
no
place
for
him.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
apparently,
what
is
alleged,
that
it
was...
the
composition
is
the...
claiming
that
mr.
wakinekona
did
not
have
an
impartial
tribunal.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
i
think
that's
probably
the
basic--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--as
i
understand
it.
if
you
read
the
complaint,
he
doesn't
even
contest
the
basis
for
the
decision.
there
is
no
allegation
anywhere
in
this
case
about--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
we
will.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
he
was
transferred...
he
was
housed
in
the
hawaii
state
prison.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
just
outside
of
honolulu.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
it
is
on
oahu.
it
is
basically
in
an
industrial
area,
and
within
the
prison
system
there
is
the
maximum
control
unit,
which
no
longer
exists
today.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
every
island
has
an
institution,
basically
medium
security
facilities
for
people
who
live
in
that
locality.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
we
have
had
a
number
of
contests.
we
have
had
contests
about
intrastate
transfers.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
and
a
number
of
state
actions
contesting
interstate
transfers.
there
were
a
number
of
transfers
in
this
period
of
time
when
we
were
reducing
the...
we
were
eliminating
the
maximum
control
unit
at
that
time,
not
unlike
vermont
in
the
howe
case,
where
they
eliminated
their
maximum
control
facility.
the...
by
the
way,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
wakinekona
at
this
time
is
in
vaccaville
medical
facility,
and
is
still
in
california.
mr.
wakinekona
filed
suit
in
federal
court
in
honolulu
for
money
damages
and
a
declaration
that
his
constitutional
rights
were
violated.
he
does
not
allege
in
the
complaint
that
the
decision
itself
to
transfer
him
to
the
mainland
was
in
any
way
wrong.
he
apparently
contests
actually
the
composition
and
the
process
set
up
in
our
procedures
prior
to
interstate
transfer
before
the
program
committee.
he
alleges
in
his
complaint
and
in
a
letter
that
he
was
transferred
from
one
hole
to
another,
only
a
larger
one,
but
he
does
not
allege
in
any
respect
that
the
conditions
of
his
confinement
were
materially
different
between
the
hawaii
system
and
the
mainland
system.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court's
decision
that
on
the
face
of
his
complaint
he
did
not
allege
a
liberty
interest
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
a
two
to
one
opinion
that
the
procedures,
the
detailed
procedures
here
alone
created
a
constitutional
right
to
due
process,
that
it
implicated
a
liberty
interest.
it
did
so
in
the
face
of
an
opinion
rendered
by
the
hawaii
supreme
court
which
interpreted
this
particular
rule,
lono
versus
ariyoshi,
which
is
attached
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
hawaii
supreme
court
specifically
held
that
rule
4
contained
no
standards,
contained
no
limitations
on
discretion,
was
a
mere
procedural
rule,
and
if
you
read
it
carefully,
you
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
supreme
court
is
saying
that
mr.
wakinekona
had
absolutely
no
expectation,
reasonable
or
otherwise,
except
for
a
unilateral
one,
in
hawaii
laws,
in
hawaii
regulations,
to
remain
in
the
hawaii
prison
system,
that
the
prison
system
has
the
absolute
discretion,
consistent
only
with
constitutional
standards,
to
transfer
inmates
to
the
mainland.
that
is,
that
the
administrator
can
transfer
them
for
any
constitutionally
permissible
reason.
now,
the
liberty
interest--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
due
process
claim
raised
by
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
grounded
in
whether
he
has
a
liberty
interest
to
remain
in
the
hawaii
prison
system
as
contemplated
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution,
and
implicit
in
the
notion
of
due
process
is
the
freedom
of
restraint
in
any
significant
way,
such
as,
for
example,
in
this
court's
on
parole
and
early
release,
for
example,
in
wolff.
and
from
roth
on,
this
court
has
said
that
we
look
to
the
nature
of
the
interest,
and
not
the
weight,
and
that
is
where
grievousness
seems
to
come
into
play,
as
to
whether
that
constitutes
a
basis
for
a
liberty
interest.
now,
in
last
term,
and
i
think
i
misspoke
earlier,
the
howe
case,
howe
versus
smith,
had
a
companion
case.
it
was
hawaii
versus
maderis,
in
which
three
hawaii
inmates
were
transferred
to
the
federal
system
in
marion,
illinois,
and
it
was...
the
same
issue
was
raised
in
that
case
as
was
raised
in
howe,
and
in
light
of
howe,
hawaii
versus
maderis
was
remanded.
there
was
no
suggestion
in
those
cases
that
an
interstate
transfer
was
grievous
in
a
constitutional
sense.
indeed,
for
purposes
of
arguing
the
grievous
aspect
of
due
process,
if
it
is...
has
any
vitality
at
all
after
the
iago
decision,
and
after
the
meachum
decision,
is
that
wakinekona,
mr.
wakinekona
would
stand
in
no
different
position
in
this
case
than
if
he
were
a
federal
prisoner
in
hawaii,
and
there
being
no
federal
prison
in
hawaii,
he
would
have
been
transferred
interstate.
and
mr.
wakinekona
is
not
irrevocably
sent
to
california.
he
still
remains
a
hawaii
prisoner,
and
under
the
western
interstate
corrections
compact,
attached
to
our
brief
in
this
matter,
he
remains
a
hawaii
prisoner,
and
he
remains
under
the
hawaii
statutes
and
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
the
notion
that
grievous
loss
in
any
way
on
its
face
implicates
a
liberty
interest.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
they
were...
the
rules
are...
i
think
it
is
probably
a
poor
choice
of
words.
it
was
in
some
respects
ambiguous,
but
at
the
time
when
these
rules
and
regulations
were
adopted,
there
was
no
definitive
ruling
in
a
sense
by
this
court
as
to
what
was
or
was
not
a
grievous
loss.
indeed,
it
seemed
to
be
going
in
the
direction
of
grievousness
as
having
some
kind
of
a
liberty
triggering
process,
and
i
think
hawaii
had
that
in
mind
when
that...
those
words
were
utilized.
but
even
in
iago,
it
was
decided
that
there
was
no
question
that
he
suffered
a
grievous
loss,
but
that
was
not
of
a
constitutional
dimension.
there
is
no
question
that
mr.
wakinekona
complains
about
being
transferred,
but
he
doesn't
complain
about
the
decision
to
transfer,
and
that
doesn't
necessarily
implicate
a
liberty
interest.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
about
the
actual
decision.
he
does
not
complain
that
the
decision
to
transfer
him
was
incorrect
in
any
material
respect.
he
complains
about
the
processes,
the
procedures
and
the
hearing
before
our
program
committee,
saying
that
that
was
incorrect,
and
therefore
his
due
process
rights
were
violated.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
if...
in
this
particular
case,
hawaii
has
adopted
rules
and
regulations
to
provide
for
procedures,
which
gives
him
a
modicum
of
process,
but
has
not
said
that
mr.
wakinekona
has
in
any
respect
a
right
to
remain
in
hawaii.
he
has
no
liberty
interest
or
entitlement
to
remain
within
the
system,
and
therefore
due
process,
we
contend,
does
not
attach.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
i
don't
believe...
i
don't
believe
that
that's
before
the
court,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
right
to
have
family
per
se
visit
is
necessarily
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
i
don't
think
that
the
right
to
have
family
visit
is
in
itself
a
liberty,
a
freedom.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
and
our
rules
and
regulations
due
use
the
term
"grievousness",
but
those
are
the
state's
rules
and
regulations.
they
are
not
necessarily
intended
to
be
of
a
constitutional
dimension.
it
is
merely
definitional
for
purposes
of
defining
in
what
situations
it
intends
to
have
a
procedure
prior
to
taking
certain
actions
with
respect
to
inmates,
whether
they
be
deemed
adverse
to
the
inmate
or
even
beneficial,
because
transfers
to
the
mainland
in
hawaii
can
be
made
for
a
variety
of
reasons
that
don't
necessarily
mean
that
the
inmate
is
a
bad
person,
or
violated
some
rule.
indeed,
in
this
case,
if
you
read
the
decision,
the
recommendation
of
the
hearing
body,
they
did
it
basically
for
his
benefit,
because
there
would
be
no
programs
available
to
this
inmate
in
hawaii.
they
transferred
him
to
the
california
system
so
that
he
would
have
available
to
him
programming
that
would
not
be
available
to
him
in
hawaii.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
that
is...
there
are
two
parts
of
the
decision,
the
recommendation--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--what
happened
was
that
they
were
evaluating
in
one
respect
his
classification.
they
found
that
because
of
his
security
risk,
because
he
was
such
an
assaultive
inmate...
he
had
threatened
guards,
he
was
an
escape
risk,
and
since
his
conviction
for
murder
he
had
committed
other
crimes...
that
his
classification
within
the
system
remained
at
maximum.
that
being
the
case,
they
had
no
choice
but
to
recommend
that
he
be
transferred
to
the
mainland,
because
the
programs
that
were
available
in
the
maximum
security
unit
in
hawaii
would
no
longer
be
available
with
the
impending
construction,
and
they
transferred
him
to
folsome
for
the
purpose
of
benefitting
him
with
those
programs.
now--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--that's
right.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
faced
with
in
hawaii
in
this
period
of
construction.
there
were
a
number
of
inmates
transferred
to
the
mainland
whose
security
classification
remained
at
maximum.
other
inmates--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--one
on
kauai,
one
on
maui,
and
one
on
the
big
island,
hawaii.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
now--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--we
don't
believe--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
it
does
not
implicate
due
process.
it
is
not
bias
of
a
constitutional
dimension.
there
is
no
hint
in
this
record
at
any
time
through
even
the
discovery
process
or
any
time
that
the
committee
itself
was
biased
of
a...
for
unconstitutional
reasons,
such
as
religion
or
race
or
anything
of
that
sort.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
well,
the...
if
you
understand
the
process
of
a
classification
within
a
prison
system,
you
will
know
that
they
have...
the
same
bodies
will
review
inmates
periodically
and
on
an
ongoing
basis,
and
they
become
familiar
with
inmates
in
the
system,
and
how
things
are
done,
and
this
has
a
utility,
because
then
they
can
make
a
more
informed
decision
about
placement
of
inmates.
it
is
not...
as
our
rules
are
defined,
impartiality
means
a
person
should
not
sit
on
the
board
who
is
a
witness
to
events
or
who
is
a
charging
person,
or
somebody
that
is
bringing
this
action
before
the
board.
it
is
not
impartial
in
any...
it
doesn't
mean
impartiality
in
any
other
sense.
i
mean,
we
would
not
have--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--in
a
juror
sense
or
even
in
a
judge
sense,
because
you
are
still
going
to
have,
in
a
small
prison
setting,
you
are
going
to
have
the
same
people
come
from
time
to
time
onto
a
committee,
and
we
would
certainly
not
say
in
the
rule
that
the
board
should
be
a
biased
one.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
it
is
impossible,
and
quite
the
contrary,
that
it
is
important
that
they
do
know
about
it.
what
we
don't
have...
all
we
had
here
was
the
same
board
saw
the
same
inmate
twice,
and
this
is
the
same
board
that
saw
many
inmates
probably
more
than
once,
two
or
three
times,
maybe
even
longer
over
a
period
of
time,
and
that
in
itself
is
not
partiality
as
defined
by
our
rules.
they
did
not
initiate
him
coming
before
it.
they
are
not
a
charging
body
or
anything
of
that
sort.
now,
the
right
to
due
process
appears
to
arise
pursuant
to
this
court's
previous
opinions
either
from
the
constitution
itself
or
from
state
law.
now,
we
submit
for
the
reasons
previously
stated
in
our
briefs
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
not
to
be
transferred
interstate.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
that's
right.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
no.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
that
presents
an
entirely
different
situation,
but...
and
it
may
have
some
constitutional
implications
where
you
have
that
kind
of
activity.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
oh,
i
don't
believe
there
is
bias
at
all,
but
i
don't
believe
that
every
single
violation
of
a
state
regulation
implicates
some
constitutional
right.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
they
may.
there
is
no--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--it
would
not.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
it
would
not
at
all,
in
that
sense.
it
would
not
implicate
a
liberty
interest,
which
is
the
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
that
isn't
the
claim
here.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
they
violated
the
state
law
that
was
provided,
and
i
might
say
before
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
that
this
rule
and
regulation
was
not
adopted
pursuant
to
the
hawaii
administrative
procedures
act,
as
claimed
in
the
brief
for
the
respondent.
the
hawaii
administrative
procedures
act
under
tai
v.
chang,
which
is
cited
in
the
lono
versus
ariyoshi
opinion,
is
specifically
exempted
because
the
rules
and
regulations
of
our
corrections
division
involve
mere
internal
management
of
our
prison
institutions,
and
has
under
that
ground
been
held
to
be
exempted
from
the
apa.
it
does
not
implicate
the
apa.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
make
that
clear.
i
do
not
agree
that
this
implicates
grievous
loss
as
this
court
may
see
it
in
the
constitutional
sense.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
within
this
regulation,
for
purposes
of
the
argument,
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
that
this
is
a
grievous
loss
as
the
rule
and
regulation
defines
it.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
very
briefly.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
inconceivable
that
a
procedural
rule
cannot
implicate
some
kind
of
liberty
interest
if
it
is
construed
by
the
state
that
it
does
so,
that
another
liberty
interest
by
virtue
of
the
rules
do,
but
in
this
case
we
have
the
lono
versus
ariyoshi
opinion,
that
specifically
says
that
this
rule
does
not
give
rise
to
any
expectation
of
liberty.
it
does
not
give
rise
to
any
expectation
that
mr.
wakinekona
will
spend
the
rest
of
his
incarceration
in
hawaii
absent
some
kind
of
good
cause.
so,
we
don't
have
that
situation
before
us.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
not
federal
claim.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
that
is
what
he
is
claiming,
is
some
kind
of
personal
animosity.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
yes,
justice
stevens,
and
also,
it
was
the
administrator
that
made
the
decision,
not
the
hearing
body.
there
is
no
allegation
of
bias
on
the
part
of
the
administrator.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
there
is
no
allegation
of
bias
in
the
complaint
against
the
decision-maker,
antone
olim,
the
person
who
made
the
decision
to
transfer,
the
one
who
has--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--you
have
a
hearing
body
of
four
people
who
make
a
recommendation
to
the
administrator,
who
makes
the
decision.
he
alleges
bias
on
the
part
of
two
members
of
that
hearing
body.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
but
not--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--that's
right.
it
would
be
the
same
case.
in
fact,
the
purpose,
if
i
may
say
briefly,
the
purpose
of
these
rules
is,
it
is
an
administrative
tool.
it
is
an
informational
gathering
device.
it
is
not
a
fact-finding
process,
as
characterized
by
counsel,
as
the
adjustment
process
is.
this
is
a
means
of
gathering
information
to
assist
the
decision-makers.
it
is
a
means
of
providing
inmate
input.
it
is
a
means
to
benefit
inmates.
and
it
also
is--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--one
of
the
reasons
why
prisons
traditionally
have
these
kinds
of
procedures
is
because
they
find
inmate
frustrations
and
tensions
lowered
when
they
have
some
kind
of
input.
if
decisions
are
made
without
any
reasons,
without
any
input,
without
any
contact,
they
feel
very
frustrated,
and
so
they
have
rules
like
this
to
involve
inmates
in
it,
and
they
feel
better
about
it.
it
has
a
utility.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
well,
the
ultimate
decision
is...
it
is
not
a
charade,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
a
mindless
event.
it
is
not
intended
to
be
a
mindless
event.
it
is
meant
to
be
an
informational
gathering
process.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
it
is,
and--
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
--and
mr.
wakinekona
also
had
a
review
process
under
the
rules,
which
he
didn't
partake
of.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
the
problem
with
the
analysis
is
that
the
due
process
analysis
breaks
down
when
you
say
that
the
right
to
a
hearing
implicates
liberty,
and
therefore
you
have
a
right
to
a
due
process
hearing
to
protect
your
right
to
a
hearing.
mr.
michael
a.
lilly
and
what
we
say
is,
that
is
not
of
a
constitutional
dimension,
justice
white.
