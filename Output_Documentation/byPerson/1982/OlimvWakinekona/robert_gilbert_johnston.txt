mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
your
honor,
i
believe
under
vitek
we
could
establish
a
liberty
interest
under
the
change
in
conditions.
there
are
very
substantial
change
in
conditions
in
a
transfer
from
hawaii
to
the
mainland.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
in
vitek,
you
have
a
two-prong
approach,
as
i
understand
it.
the
first
prong
addresses
the
question
of
the
statutes.
the
second
prong
addresses
the
question
of
the
residuum
of
liberty
that
a
person
retains
which
would
preclude
a
transfer
from
the...
from
the
prison,
the
mental
hospital
without
some
due
process.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
there
would
be
a
difference
on
that,
your
honor.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
but
i
would
submit
that
it
is
officially
analogous.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
not
entirely,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
the
precise
language
is
that
there
was
a
qualitative
change
in
the
conditions
of
confinement
not
substantiated
by
the
terms
of
the
sentence.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
yes,
your
honor,
it
must,
but
i
think
that
this
case
is
sufficiently
analogous,
because
i
would
submit
that
a
transfer
of
a
person
such
as
wakinekona
from
hawaii
under
the
circumstances
he
was
transferred
to
the
mainland
indeed
raises
the
same
kind
of
liberty
interest
that
is
raised
in
vitek
on
the
transfer
from
the
penal
institution
to
the
mental
hospital.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
i
would
say
about
350
diagonally.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
that
would
raise
a
very
difficult
question,
your
honor,
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
could
justify
a
change
of
that
distance.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
yes,
it
would,
if
he
were
to
be
transferred
to
a
different
island
entirely,
because
he
would
still
have
the
problem
of
interisland
or
intercounty
transport
for
the
family
to
visit
him,
unless
he
had
family
on
the
island
that
it
was
on.
however,
i
would
just
say,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
that
my
recollection
of
the
time
was
that
there
was
another
facility
called
halava,
which
was
approximately
15
minutes
from
the
hawaii
state
prison
located
in
kalihi,
just
outside
of
honolulu.
now,
i
do
believe
that
there
were
people
in
that
place,
and
i
do
believe
that
we
can
find
references
to
halava
in
the
record.
but
i
would
like
to
clear
up
one
thing
right
away,
if
i
may,
because
there
have
been
several
questions
on
this
point,
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
record
on
the
impartiality
of
this
particular
tribunal.
contrary
to
mr.
lilly's
position,
i
believe
that
the
complaint
that
was
filed
with
the
supporting
tro
to
stop
the
transfer
of
wakinekona
raised
questions
that
went
beyond
the
mere
violation
of
the
regulations,
and
indeed,
though
i
didn't
believe
in
view
of
the
court's
ruling
below
that
that
question
was
really
before
the
court,
i
can
refer
the
court
to
the
record
at
pages
394
and
also
at
page
443
and
444,
in
which
there
are
definitely
questions
of
personal
animosity
raised
regarding
this
particular
tribunal
as
to
wakinekona.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
no,
it's--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--yes,
based
upon
whether
or
not
there
is
indeed
a
liberty
interest
created.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
and
also,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
residual
of
liberty
that
would
be
protected
regardless
of
the
existence
of
state
law.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
no,
the
court
of
appeals,
though
it
cited
vitek,
went
on
the
rules
alone.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
that
is
correct.
that
is
what--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--i
don't
know
why
they
did
that,
your
honor.
i
just
don't.
there
is
definitely
in
the
discovery
supporting
the
complaints,
the
first
complaint
and
then
the
first
amended
complaint,
allegations
of
personal
bias
as
to
at
least
two
of
the
members
of
the
tribunal.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
they
don't
involve
the
issue
of
bias.
they
involve
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
a
liberty
interest,
because
that
was
the
only
ruling
presented
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
no,
just
to
the
contrary,
because
we
have
alleged
that
it
was
biased.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
believe
that
we
should,
regarding
the
question
of
personal
animosity,
the
bias,
that
should
be
determined
in
the
first
instance
by
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
yes,
and
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate,
if
there
is
a
liberty
interest
here,
to
remand
for
that
specific
issue,
because
there
is
indeed
a
jury
asked
for
in
this
action
as
to
the
facts,
and
we
definitely,
i
believe,
on
the
record,
have
a
question
of
fact
as
to
that
point.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
it
was
raised
in
the
trial
court,
and
the
trial
court
didn't
address
it,
and
therefore
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
address
it.
and
if
i
may
take
another
step
back
along
the
line,
justice
o'connor,
the
question
of
the
rules
goes
beyond
merely
rule
4.
we
claim
there
is
a
statutory
scheme
involving
rules
3,
4,
and
5,
in
this
action,
and
it
is
the
statutory
scheme
that
we
should
be
addressing
in
this
matter.
now--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--your
honor,
in
that
regard,
the
lono
case
addressed
only
rule
4,
because
that
apparently
was
all
that
was
presented
to
it,
rather
than
considering
the
other
rules
that
should
be
read
in
conjunction.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
i
would
submit
that
perhaps
counsel
didn't
present
the
other
rules
to
the
court,
and
that
could
well
explain
what
happened.
i
would
also
submit
that
in
view
of
this
court's
recent
ruling
in
logan
versus
zimmerman
brush,
that
this
court
indeed
does
have
the
power,
if
not
the
duty,
to
address
this
particular
issue,
regardless
of
the
lono
decision.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
if
i
may,
the...
looking
at
the
rules
in
total,
particularly
rule
5,
there
are
four
circumstances
in
which
an
inmate
is
entitled
to
have
a
lawyer
present
at
a
hearing,
two
of
which
are
in
essence
the
disciplinary
hearings.
the
other
is
the
classification
hearing.
and
part
of
the
argument
is,
if
you
read
these
rules
as
a
whole,
it
seems
somewhat
inconceivable
to
us
that
prison
authorities
who
promulgated
these
rules
approved
by
the
attorney
general
and
by
the
lieutenant
governor
at
that
time
would
give
a
person
such
as
wakinekona
a
right
to
counsel
in
these
four
situations,
one
of
which,
and
these
are
the
only
four
situations
you
are
entitled
to
lawyers
in
these
hearings,
one
of
which
involves
an
interstate
transfer.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
yes.
yes,
indeed,
mr.
wakinekona
was
represented
at
the
classification
hearing
by
a
lawyer.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
that
is
the
defect
in
the
hearing
process.
i
am
just
suggesting
that
one
wouldn't
expect
correction
authorities
to
give
an
inmate
a
lawyer
at
that
particular
kind
of
hearing
unless
they
considered
it
a
very
important
type
of
hearing.
and
that
is
the
thrust
of
rule
5.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
no,
i
think
we
have
to
look
to
the
rules
and
see
what
has
occurred
in
the
context
of
this
case,
in
view
of
the
particular
concerns
that
we
would
have
for
transferring
somebody
interstate,
and
in
addition
the
rules
and
practices
of
giving
a
hearing
in
this.
i
would
simply--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--i
would
refer
you
to
the
joint
appendix
and
the
rule
4,
the
general
considerations.
in
that
rule,
they
are
worried
about
what
is--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
page
20
of
the
joint
appendix.
it
starts
with
the
rule
4
classification
hearing.
now,
it
is
our
position
the
requirements
of
determining
what
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
community,
of
the
prisoner,
of
the
penal
system,
of
the
state,
would
indicate
that
there
should
be
some
reason
in
the
minds
of
the
drafters
of
the
rules
as
to
why
they
would
hold
these
hearings
to
determine
that
they
meet
these
standards
set
out
in
that
particular
provision.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
well,
no,
i
don't
think
we
can...
well,
i
guess
we
could
disagree
on
that
and
make
such
a
conclusion.
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
really
not,
because
you
do
have
that
provision.
you
do
have
them
holding
hearings
for
wakinekona,
lono,
and
other
people
that
are
being
transferred
interstate,
and
you
do
have
the
requirements
in
this
particular
situation
that
the
tribunal
make
specific
findings
of
facts
based
only
on
the
evidence
presented,
which
then
becomes
the
recommendations
that
restrict
the
prison
director--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
that
is
a
correct
reading
of
the
court,
that...
what
they
had
before
them.
and
i
would
not
try
to
represent
differently.
and
i
would
submit
in
response
to
that
that
again
the
court
did
not
read,
for
whatever
reason
they
didn't,
the
rules
as
a
whole.
and
they
did
not
address
specifically
the
same
concerns
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
that
there
is
a
requirement
of
specific
findings
of
facts
which
temper
the
discretion
or
the
power
of
the
prison
administrator,
because
if
we
refer
to
page--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--on
one
point,
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
afraid
that
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
asking
you
to
do,
and
i
am
suggesting
that
you
do
have
such
power,
because
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
did
in
logan
versus
zimmerman
brush
on
the
question
of
the
fair
employment
practices
act
in
illinois.
and
so
that
we
do
believe
this
court
has
that
power.
it
has
had
that
power
in
the
past,
and
it
has
exercised
that
power.
and
so
that
i
think
that
this
court
should
in
this
case
look
to
that
zimmerman
case
and
read
the
lono
case
in
light
of
your
power
under
zimmerman.
i
would
also
say,
if
i
may,
that
we
still
contend
absent
the
rules
that
wakinekona
retained
a
liberty
interest
because
of
the
particular
circumstances
in
this
case.
he
is
transferred
across
the
pacific
ocean
to
california,
isolated
from
other
hawaiians
entirely,
isolated
from
his
family,
his
friends,
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
the
hawaii
corrections
agencies.
he
is
also
put
in
a
position
where
he
can't
reach
social
workers
who
are
trained
to
dealing
with
persons
such
as
wakinekona.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
he
was
transferred
to
folsome,
he
was
kept
in
maximum
security
there
without
any
programs.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
i
am
suggesting
that
in
wakinekona's
case,
a
factor
which
is
unique
to
this
situation
among
the
questions
of
distance
is
also
the
consideration
that
wakinekona,
if
in
hawaii,
would
have
access
to
workers
who
are
trained
to
deal
with
a
person
such
as
wakinekona
who
is
a
native
hawaiian.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
i
am
not
saying
it
turns
solely
on
that.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
i
am
suggesting
the
total
impact
of
all
these
factors
i
am
addressing
raises
a
liberty
interest
which
gives
wakinekona
an
entitlement
to
a
due
process
hearing
which
would
basically
in
any
prison
situation
include
an
impartial
or
a
fair
tribunal,
because
we
don't
have
many
of
the
other
accoutrements
of
due
process
in
prison
hearings.
understandably
so,
but...
so
that
that
becomes
the
core
question
of
due
process
in
any
prison
hearing,
a
fair
tribunal,
because
you
really
are
not
allowed
to
address
the
questions
of
cross
examination,
confrontation
of
witnesses,
and
those.
those
due
process
rights
are
cut
back
on
you
in
prison
hearings
usually.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
i
would
think
that
you
are
entitled
as
a
matter
of
course
to
an
unbiased
tribunal.
however,
the
way
the
lower
court
ruled
on
it,
as
i
understand
it,
they
felt
that
there
had
to
be
a
liberty
interest
to
entitle
you
to
any
due
process
hearing
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
no,
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
position
we
took
in
the
lower
court,
in
the
trial
court,
but
we
didn't
win
on
that
point.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
no,
i
didn't
change
the
strategy,
if
i
may.
i
think
i
have
to
address
what
the
lower
court
left
me
with.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
be
delighted
to
take
this
case
back
and
try
it
in
front
of
the
federal
district
court
in
hawaii.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
well,
yes,
your
honor.
we
do
believe
that
the
record
does
reveal
that,
and
we
did,
by
the
way,
raise
that
issue
of
a
bias
and
personal
animosity
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
that
is
the
only
thing
i
think
mr.
wakinekona
can
claim
here,
and
that
he
has
indeed
been
deprived
of
his
liberty
because
there
was
an
interest
where
he
should
be
entitled
to
somebody
that
made
this
decision.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
yes,
they
went
on
that
point,
your
honor,
but
that
was
not
the
only
point
we
had
been
arguing.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
your
honor,
again,
i
would
refer
you
to
the
various
pages
i
did,
but
the
answer
is
yes.
i
think
looking
first
at
the
original
complaint
that
was
filed...
it
is
probably
around
page...
somewhere
about
page
12.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
there
was
an
affidavit
attached
to
that.
there
are
answers
to
interrogatories
and
requests
to
admit
that
raised
the
question
of
the
personal
bias
of
petitioner
wilhelm
and
smythe.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
no,
the
district
court
did
not
address
any
of
the
discovery.
indeed,
the
district
court
took
the
particular
position
that
the...
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
essence
rather
than
a
summary
judgment.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
should
be
thrown
out
on
that
point.
i
think
we
should
be
allowed
to
have
a
hearing
on
that.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
i
would
agree
that...
if
the
court
agrees
that
wakinekona
has
an
interest
that
entitles
him
to
a
due
process
hearing,
that
that
matter
should
be
remanded
back
down
to
the
federal
district
court
of
hawaii
to
resolve
that
matter,
and
then
perhaps
we
could
ignore
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
if
it
is
going
to
cause
the
grief
that
it
seems
to
be
causing.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
as
i
understand
it,
really,
the
question
is,
fano
would
insist
that
there
be
a
liberty
interest
created
in
order
to
have
procedural
protections.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
i
would
believe
that
fano
would
take
that
position,
but,
your
honor,
i
think
that
fano
has
been
rather
severely
cut
back
by
the
case
of
vitek,
and
i
would
suggest
that
our
case
is
almost
on
all
fours
with
vitek
on
both
of
the
points
that
we
are
addressing.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
yes,
i
am
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
i
am
suggesting
this
particular
interstate
transfer
is
out
of
bounds,
because
it
in
essence,
as
we
have
argued--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--yes,
that
is
one
point,
your
honor,
and
as
i
said--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
your
honor,
as
in
any
case
where
we
begin
to
move
the
distances
back
and
forth
a
little
bit,
the
distance
should
be
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
account.
i
think
the
distance
is
rather
misleading,
because
it
is
the
impact
or
the
effect
of
the
distance
upon
the
prisoner
on
an
intrastate
transfer
that
i
think
is
important.
the
isolation.
in
this
case,
wakinekona
is
indeed
in
for
life
without
possibility
of
parole
as
a
young
man.
in
essence,
he
could
be
left
up
in
california,
isolated
from
hawaii
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
in
their
prison
system.
so
that
i
would
submit
that
under
those
circumstances,
this
comes
to
the
closest
thing
i
have
seen
in
modern
jurisprudence
to
banishment.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
mr.
chief
justice,
that
raises
the
issue
that
we
have
made
a
finding
that
they
have
no
facilities
adequate,
which
presupposes,
i
take
it,
a
hearing.
i
would
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
that
would
be
appropriate.
i
don't
think
i
can
argue
that
the
state
could
never
transfer
him.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
to
the
court.
i
am
suggesting
that
if
they
wish
to
transfer
a
person
such
as
wakinekona
from
hawaii,
that
that
should
require
under
the
second
point
in
vitek
a
due
process
hearing,
because
it
is
so
far
out
of
bounds
to
send
somebody
like
wakinekona
away
forever
that
it
just
strikes
me...
it
is
outrageous
to
banish
somebody
from
their
homeland.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
in
this
case,
yes.
if
we
were
to
take
that
position,
justice
o'connor,
i
then
think
we
would
be
faced
with
what
process
is
then
due.
however,
here
we
do
have
standards
of
what
process
is
due.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
i
am
afraid
that
i
can't
dispute
that
point,
but
i
do
think
that
this
court
can
look
past
the
hawaii
decision
in
this
instance,
because
of
the
underlying
due
process
concerns
of
an
impartial
tribunal,
and
i
do
think
that
this
court
can
even
ignore
the
question
of
the
regulations
and
look
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
transfer
of
this
nature
for
wakinekona
is
so
outrageous
that
there
should
be
a
hearing
to
decide
if
there
is
justifiable
reason
to
send
him
across
the
sea.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
well,
i
don't...
i--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--i
would
think
that
we
could
contrive
as
an
advocate
for
somebody
almost
any
argument
we
wished,
but
i
would
hope
that
we
wouldn't
go
that
far,
justice
white.
i
would
think
that--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--i
would
think--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--i
would
think
that
we
would
have
perhaps
had
a
very
good
chance
of
prevailing
at
that
time
if
indeed
we
had
a
neutral
or
an
impartial
hearing
board
rather
than
the
one
that
was
personally
biased
against
wakinekona,
and
i
do
think
we
should
be
entitled
to
give
that
at
least
a
chance,
because
otherwise,
as
i
say,
mr.
wakinekona
is
gone
forever,
as
far
as
we
can
tell
at
this
point.
so
that
i
would...
i
would
submit,
then,
that
we
have
both
those
points.
i
think
those
procedural
rules,
if
they
don't...
if
we
call
them
procedural
rules,
the
character
of
procedure
in
substance
sliding
in
this
set
of
rules--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--no.
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
it
was
a
regular
lawyer
who
asked
for
an
extension
of
time
in
order
to
prepare
the
case,
and
then
the
whole
problem--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--began
to
develop
when
we
complained
about
the
character
of
the
particular
tribunal
as
being
a
tribunal
that
was
biased,
and
the
bias
goes
to
personal
animosity
and
violation
of
the
rules,
both,
not
just
violation
of
the
rules,
and
i
think
that
that
makes
it
an
important
difference.
but
i
do
think
that
the
procedural
rules,
if
i
may,
do
infer
some
sort
of
substantive
right,
usually.
it
is...
i
find
it
difficult
as
a
lawyer
to
believe
that
we
create
procedural
rules
without--
mr.
robert
gilbert
johnston
--well,
i
think
that
under
these
rules
that
we
do
have
a
hearing,
that
they
are
entitled
to
find
these
points
because
of
the
introductory
paragraphs
to
rule
3.
thank
you.
