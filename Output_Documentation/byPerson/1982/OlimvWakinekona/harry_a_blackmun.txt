justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
by
way
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioners
are
members
of
a
"program
committee"
for
the
hawaii
state
prison.
they
investigated
a
breakdown
in
discipline
within
the
maximum
controlled
unit
and
singled
out
the
respondent
another
inmate
as
troublemakers.
after
a
hearing
at
which
the
respondent
retained
counsel
to
represent
him,
the
committee
recommended
that
he
be
continued
to
be
classified
as
a
maximum
security
risk
and
that
he
be
transferred
to
a
prison
in
california.
the
administrator
of
the
hawaii
prison
accepted
the
committee's
recommendation
and
the
transfer
was
effectuated.
the
respondent
then
filed
this
suit
in
federal
court
alleging
that
he
had
been
denied
procedural
due
process.
the
federal
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint.
it
held
that
the
applicable
hawaii
regulations
governing
prison
transfers
did
not
create
a
substantive
liberty
interest
that
was
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
however
reversed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
in
turn
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
an
interstate
prison
transfer
does
not
deprive
an
inmate
of
any
liberty
interest
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
in
and
of
itself.
the
inmate
has
no
justifiable
expectation
that
he
will
be
incarcerated
in
any
particular
prison
within
a
state.
and
he
also
has
no
justifiable
expectation
that
he
will
be
incarcerated
in
a
particular
state.
statutes
and
interstate
agreements
recognize
that
it
is
often
necessary
to
transfer
inmates
to
prisons
in
other
states.
confinement
in
another
state
is
within
the
normal
limits
or
range
of
custody
which
the
conviction
has
authorized
the
transferring
state
to
impose.
and
this
is
so
even
though
the
transfer
as
in
this
case
involves
a
long
distance
and
an
ocean
crossing.
and
thus
the
confinement
remains
within
constitutional
limits.
we
also
hold
that
hawaii's
prison
regulations
do
not
create
a
constitutionally
protected
liberty
interest.
those
regulations
place
no
substantive
limitations
on
the
prison
administrator's
discretion
to
transfer.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
justice
brennan
and
justice
stevens

part
i
of
justice
marshall's
dissenting
opinion.
