mr.
lilly,
what
specific
rules
were
not
followed
by
the
state
in
connection
with
the
process
of
this
transfer?
was
it
rule
4-2,
on
the
composition
of
the
program
committee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
only
alleged
failure
to
follow
the
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
you
understand
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
as
you
understand
it,
the
sole
defect
here,
if
there
is
one,
would
be
in
the
composition
of
the
program
committee
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--provided
the
hearing.
and
do
you
agree
that
under
hawaii's
adopted
rules,
that
the
transfer
here
would
fit
the
definition
of
a
grievous
loss?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
are
rules
3
and
5
involved
in
this
case?
i
thought
rule
3
had
to
do
with
the
adjustment
process
to
punish
a
prisoner
for
some
violation
while
incarcerated,
and
that
rule
5
had
to
do
with
legal
counsel,
and
i
did
not
understand
that
either
of
those
rules
was
implicated
in
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
even
conceding
that
the
consequences
of
an
interstate
transfer
are
significant
and
important,
that
doesn't
answer
the
question,
does
it?
that
alone
won't
resolve
the
issue,
will
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
there
are
no
substantive
standards
set
forth
in
hawaii
procedure,
are
there,
to
govern
when
an
interstate
transfer
will
be--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
then
as
determined
by
the
hawaii
supreme
court,
the
final
decision
is
made
by
the
facility
administrator,
and
he
is
free
to
disregard
those
findings,
apparently,
without
any
substantive
standard,
and
make
the
determination.
now,
that
is
what
i
understand
the
hawaii
supreme
court
has
determined.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
what
you
want
us
to
do
is
say
the
hawaii
supreme
court
was
wrong,
and
we
aren't
bound
by
its
determination.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
hearing
even
if
there
are
no
standards
to
determine
whether
the
transfer
should
be
ordered
or
not?
just
the
hearing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
is
debatable,
i
guess,
isn't
it,
if
you
read
the
hawaii
court
decision?
