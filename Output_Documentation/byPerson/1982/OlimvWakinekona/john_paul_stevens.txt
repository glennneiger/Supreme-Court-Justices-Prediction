justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
a
question
about
your
prisons?
where
was
he
incarcerated
before
his
transfer
to
california?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
where,
just
out
of
curiosity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
on
oahu?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they
have
similar
institutions
on
other
islands
in
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
you
haven't
had
this
kind
of
problem
with
intra-island
transfers?
nobody
has
been
contesting
your
right
to
move
an
inmate
from
one
island
to
another
within
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
doesn't
implicate
a
liberty
interest,
why
can't
you
be
as
biased
as
you
want
to
be?
i
mean,
if
you
are
not
depriving
the
man
of
liberty,
he
is
not
entitled
to
due
process,
is
he?
it
is
a
liberty
interest
under
state
law,
i
said,
but
it
might
implicate
a
liberty
interest
under
the
federal
constitution
if
you
deprived
a
person
of...
or
he
imposed
grievous
loss
through
a
biased
agency.
but
that
isn't
the
claim
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
because
i
may
have
missed
it
before...
before
we
broke
for
lunch.
did
you
agree
that
this
transfer
does
involve
grievous
loss
within
the
meaning
of
your
regulation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is
whether
it
involves
grievous
loss
within
the
meaning
of
your
regulation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
john
paul
stevens
contemplates.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
changed
your
strategy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
mr.
lilly?
supposing
you
had
no
rules
at
all,
which
in
effect
you
are
saying
that
is
what
the
hawaii
decision
amounts
to
here...
there
are
no
substantive
rules...
and
the
prisoner
alleged
that
it
is,
in
his
words,
a
grievous
loss
to
have
to
be
transferred
to
the
mainland,
and
that
the
only
reason
he
is
being
transferred
is
because
of
the
personal
animosity
that
the
man
who
has
the
power
to
make
the
transfer
has
toward
him
personally.
he
just
doesn't
like
him.
would
he
have
a
claim
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
he
would
have
a
federal
claim.
because
that
is
pretty
much
what
this
case
is,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
and
your
position
is,
there
is
no
constitutional
protection
to
an
arbitrary
transfer
in
the
sense
of
just
motivated
by
hatred,
personal
hatred,
or
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
we
have
to
assume,
because
the
complaint
is
dismissed
on
its
face,
that
there
was
an
adequate
allegation
of
bias.
maybe
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
there
is
no
liberty
interest
involved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
wasn't
it
made
by
a
hearing
board
of
several
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
from
your
point
of
view,
it
would
be
the
same
case
even
if
the
administrator
were
biased.
