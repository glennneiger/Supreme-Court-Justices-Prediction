which

be

inmates.
justice

and
another
thing
is,
how
does
his
family
visit
him
in
folsome?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
a
little
more
than
a
normal
interstate
transfer.
like
for
example
if
you
transfer
somebody
from
newark
to
new
york
city,
that
is
crossing
a
river,
and
this
is
crossing
a
body
of
water,
but
it
is
not
a
river.

the
pacific
ocean
isn't
between
vermont
and
georgia.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
right
to
have
family
visits
within
liberty,
do
you
consider?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
a
liberty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
think
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
he
was
transferred
because
he
was
such
an
unruly
prisoner.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
give
us
both.
don't
just
give
us
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
benefitting
him
with
those
programs?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
he
have
a
lawyer?
i
thought
the
attorney
general
said
he
did.
did
i
misunderstand
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--the
kind
of
procedural
rules,
was
this
"lawyer"
a
fellow
inmate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
a
regular
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
