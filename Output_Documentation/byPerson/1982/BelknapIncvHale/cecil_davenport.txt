mr.
cecil
davenport
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
answer
a
couple
of
inquiries
if
i
may.
the
rules
of
procedure
in
the
state
of
kentucky
are
paraphrased
in
1954
from
the
federal
rules
and
with
very
few
exceptions
are
the
same.
and
this
was
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
which
is
the
same
as
it
is
under
the
federal
rules,
or
the
interpretation
is
the
same
in
kentucky.
and
this
was
therefore
an
appeal
from
that
summary
judgment
of
the
jefferson
circuit
court.
this
case
was
first
removed
to
u.s.
district
court,
then
remanded
back
to
state
court,
then
upon
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
before
very
little
proof
was
taken...
only
one
deposition
had
been
taken...
to
test
the
pleadings
and
test
the
law,
the
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
was
made.
it
was
sustained
in
the
jefferson
circuit
court
and
thereupon
it
was
appealed
to
our
court
of
appeals.
our
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
jefferson
circuit
court
and
held
in
the
opinion
that
has
been
referred
to
that
it
was
only
a
peripheral
concern
to
the
national
scene
and
the
national
act.
i
believe
the
thing
that
bothered
me
concerning
this
case,
and
it's
bothered
me
for
some
couple
of
years
since
we
have
been
going
through
this
process,
and
i
think
that
was
finally
answered
here
today,
and
i
feel
more
at
ease.
in
our
bowing
down
to
the
holy
grail
of
national
labor
relations
board
preemption
and
unusual
policy
of
handling
labor
law,
we
have
lost
sight
of
the
very
most
important
thing,
and
that
is
the
400
replacements.
what
happens
to
them?
do
they
fall
through
the
crack
in
philosophical
theories
of
the
best
way
for
the
best
and
largest
good
to
handle
the
overall
peace?
mr.
cecil
davenport
no,
because
it
would
have
been
preempted
by
the
federal
act.
mr.
cecil
davenport
that
is
correct.
mr.
cecil
davenport
justice
white,
i
could
be
wrong,
but
the
statement
was
made
earlier
by
my
colleague
that
this
was
a
violation.
i
submit
that
it
is
a
violation
to
give
a
raise,
but
it
is
not...
and
i
cannot
recall
any
case
that
ever
spoke
of
making
promises
to
replacement
employees
being
a
violation
and
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
cecil
davenport
that
is
correct.
and
again,
i'd
like
to
reiterate,
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
give
a
blanket
raise
because
that
is
inducement
to
the
outside
to
come
in
and
an
unfair
economic
weapon,
if
you
will.
but
i
know
of
no
case
that
ever
spoke
of
the
types
of
promises
that
can
be
made
to
replacement
employees
being
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
cecil
davenport
well,
apparently
under
the
overall
policy
and
regulations
laid
down
by
the
board,
the
offer
of
a
wage
is
an
unfair
inducement
to
entice
off
the
picket
line
those
back
in.
but
the
hiring
of
replacement
employees
per
se
would
not
likewise
be
an
inducement.
i
mean,
it
might
be
a
threat
to
them,
but
it
is
certainly
not
an
inducement.
what
we
have
here
is
attempting
to
broaden
the
scope
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
under
the
guise
of
the
broad
terms
"arguably
protected"
or
under
the
broad
terms
of
the
necessity
to
give
economic
weapons
and
create
a
detente,
so
to
speak,
a
philosophical
theory
of
governing
the
labor
peace.
now,
this
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
time.
but
it
is
inconceivable
to
us
that
in
this
process,
if
the
theory
of
the
nlrb
were
taken
and
if
it
were
sanctioned
by
this
court,
it
is
inconceivable
that
there
could
be
400
people
in
these
united
states
that
would
not
be
treated
in
the
same
substantial
fashion
as
the
rest
of
the
population.
how
are
these
people,
for
instance,
to
know
that
they
must
govern
themselves
in
dealing
with
an
employer
in
an
entirely
different
situation
if
he
has
a
strike
going
than
they
would
be
correspondingly
required
to
deal
with
that
same
employer
when
there
is
no
strike
in
evidence?
mr.
cecil
davenport
yes,
they
are.
and
i
submit
that
it
is
their
prerogative
to
assume
that
the
law
would
be
applied
in
the
same
fashion
to
that
employer
with
regard
to
telling
the
truth
and
not
telling
the
truth
during
a
strike
time
as
it
would
be
applied
to
that
same
employer
were
it
to
be
outside
of
that
strike
time.
that's
all
we're
saying.
mr.
cecil
davenport
well,
it
is
not
as
they
contend,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
presume
that
if
this
court
had
laid
down
such
a
decision
that
an
employer
had
the
right
to
give
out
false
information
in
order
to
induce
hordes
of
people
to
come
to
work
for
him
as
replacements,
then
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
parties
under
that
posture
to
know
what
that
law
was,
yes,
sir.
i
would
conceivably
hope
that
in
my
day
that
never
comes
about.
mr.
cecil
davenport
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
this
is
a
suit
in
tort,
labeled
and
hopingly
will
be
proved
when
the
day
comes
of
fraud
in
the
inducement
and
breach
of
contract.
what
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
attempting
and
the
employer
is
attempting
to
do
is
to
conclude
and
say
that
tort,
the
determination
of
tort
by
the
several
states
involved...
involving
action
during
a
time
that
a
strike
takes
place
has
been
preempted
and
taken
from
them
for
adjudication.
that's
what
they're
attempting
to
broaden
the
scope
of
the
act
to
include.
mr.
cecil
davenport
i
think
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
position
of
the
board
is
that
arguably
because
this
arose
out
of
a
time
when
a
labor
dispute
was
going
on,
then
under
the
concept
of
garmon
and
under
the
act
and
the
amendments
that
is
preempted,
simply
because
it
arose.
and
may
i
point
out
where
that
is
in
error.
we've
relied
greatly
upon
linn
versus
united
plant
guard
workers
of
america,
and
let
me
quote
from
that,
page
663
of
that
opinion:
"nor
should
the
fact
that
defamation.
"
--this
was
a
tort;
this
was
a
defamation
action
between
a
manager
of
a
plant
on
the
employer
after
the
strike
was
over
against
the
union
for
libel
and
slander
with
regard
to
leaflets,
et
cetera,
and
this
court
says:
"nor
should
the
fact
that
defamation
arises
during
a
labor
dispute
give
the
board
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
remedy
its
consequences.
"
so
just
because...
and
that's
what
they're
really
saying,
that
tort
actions,
which
the
states
have
had
original
jurisdiction
since
the
inception
of
the
constitution,
has
been
diminished,
or
jurisdiction
over
those
torts
and/or
contracts,
has
been
diminished
to
the
extent
that
it
has
been
preempted
by
the
provisions
of
the
act.
and
all
we
are
saying
is
that
this
could
never
arguably
be
of
any
problem
to
the
board
in
extending
its
jurisdiction
to
mediate
the
peace
of
a
labor
industry
as
long
as
you
require
the
employer
simply
to
tell
the
truth
and
be
honest
about
it.
it
doesn't
afford
any
harm
to
the
overall
administration
of
the
act.
and
torts
have
been
brought.
i
think
we
have
to,
if
i
may,
analyze
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
previously.
the
principal
case
is
that
of
linn
versus
united
plant
guard
workers
of
america,
and
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
manager
of
the
employer's
plant
after
a
strike
brought
suit
for
defamation
of
character,
libel
and
slander
against
the
union
for
the
dissemination
of
leaflets
and
scandalous
material
in
those
leaflets
concerning
him
during
a
strike.
and
the
court
held
that
that
tort
could
be
litigated
by
state
court
under
two
or
three
different
theories,
number
one
being
it
was
such
a
complete
concern
to
the
respective
states
that
it
was
not
arguably
within
the
purview
or
would
not
disturb
the
overall
policy
of
the
labor
movement
by
allowing
the
states,
which
had
a
greater
concern
than
did
the
labor
movement
with
regard
to
that
particular
type
of
action.
now,
let's
consider...
and
there
are
only
two...
there
are
only
really
four
cases
on
which
torts
have
been
allowed.
two
of
those,
they
were
allowed;
two
of
those,
they
would
have
been
allowed
except
the
facts
were
not
appropriate,
the
linn
being
the
principal
case.
now,
let's
consider
what
the
similarities
are
between
the
linn
case
and
this
case.
there
were
torts
committed
in
both
cases.
there
was
misrepresentation
in
both
cases.
the
injury...
there
was
injury
in
both
cases,
except
in
our
case
it's
a
lot
greater.
it's
400
to
one
greater.
there
are
400
people
here
who
were
just
summarily
discharged.
there
were
many
of
these
workers
who
took,
in
pursuance
to
that
advertisement,
jobs
at
lesser
pay
because
the
current
jobs
they
had
were
seasonal.
there
were
people
who
left
secure
jobs
to
go
because
of
the
advantages
advertised
and
guaranteed
by
that
advertisement.
and
they
have
been
work...
some
of
them
have
been
out
of
work
ever
since.
the
same...
in
the
linn
case
and
in
our
case,
in
both
cases
the
action
was...
the
defendant's
action
was
not
protected
in
either
one
of
these
cases
by
any
constitutional
provision,
and
in
both
of
these
cases
the
national
labor
relations
board,
which
so
desperately
wants
jurisdiction
of
these
particular
items,
can
neither
give
any
remedy
or
offer
any
relief
to
the
parties
that
they
ostensibly
say
they
intend
to
protect.
now,
there
were
some
dissimilar
factors
between
the
linn
case
and
our
case.
one,
in
that,
in
the
linn
case,
the
nlrb
does
take
recognition
of
libel
and
slander,
at
least
to
a
limited
degree,
because
it
will
consider
those
items
in
election
cases
and
set
aside
elections
if
there
has
been
misrepresentation
with
regard
to
libel
and
slander.
never
has
the
nlrb
in
any
case
awarded
any
damages,
awarded
any
form
of
relief
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
in
a
tort
action.
never.
there's
another
dissimilar
factor,
in
the
linn
case,
the
action
took
place
between
two
parties
to
a
labor
dispute.
there
was
a
manager
of
an
employer's
plant,
suing
the
union.
in
our
case,
there
are
third
parties,
who
had
no
part
in
the
labor
dispute
whatsoever,
except
to
go
to
work.
so
there
is
that
dissimilarity,
that
dissimilarity
is
much
in
our
favor.
if
i
could
comment
about
two
other
problems
which
have
arisen,
1),
most
important,
there
have
been
some
remarks
made
both
in
the
briefs
and
today
concerning
"permanent"
being
a
work
of
art.
i
know
of
no
decision
and
i
have
never
seen
a
comment
that
says
that
"permanent"
is
a
work
of
art
or
is
any
different
than
that
which
i
learned
in
school,
and
from
random
house
dictionary
of
the
english
language,
it
says:
"intended
to
exist
or
function
for
a
long,
indefinite
period
without
regard
to
unforseeable
conditions.
"
and
gives
two
examples,
permanent
construction
and
permanent
employee.
mr.
cecil
davenport
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement,
yes.
mr.
cecil
davenport
no,
so
long
as
the
jobs
were
available
and
those
conditions
existed
which
were
appropriate
for
them
to
be
employed.
mr.
cecil
davenport
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement,
yes,
sir.
mr.
cecil
davenport
absolutely.
i,
as
a
practitioner,
would,
and
certainly
i
would
advise
them
to.
mr.
cecil
davenport
yes,
sir,
it
would
be
five
elements.
mr.
cecil
davenport
fraud
must
be
made
with
an
intent
to
decieve,
to
someone
knowing
that,
presuming
that
he
is
going
to
rely
upon
it,
and
that
he
must
rely,
and
it
must
be
false,
and
there
must
be
detriment.
mr.
cecil
davenport
that
is
correct.
mr.
cecil
davenport
that
applies
in
the
fair
state
of
kentucky.
there
is
one
other
item
that
i
would
like
to
reply
to,
and
that
is,
this
question
about
the
union
being
the
obligative
representative
of
all
of
the
employees.
i
would
simply
like
to
refer
again
to
the
contract,
that
the
union,
in
secret,
without
the
other
employees,
that
theoretically,
if
that
were
true,
they
would
be
inclined
to
represent,
sat
down
with
the
company,
when
the
company
had
made
a
decision
that
it
had
made
a
bad
choice,
and
made
a
contract
which
was
detrimental
to
the
400
that
it
was
in
a
fiduciary
position
and
obligated
to
represent
fairly.
now
we
contend
that
they
are
not,
they
are
not
the
representatives,
but
that
is
fair
statement
of
what
position
they
were
in,
if
that
theory
would
be
bought.
they
were
not
the
representatives,
if
they
were
the
representatives,
they
did
everything
in
their
power
to
enter
into
a
written
contract
which
on
page
10
of
the
brief
of
belknap
inc.,
says
that:
"the
company
and
the
union
further
agree
that
in
the
event
it
is
necessary
that
the
company
terminate
replacement
employees,
in
order
to
comply
with
this
recall
schedule,
such
terminations
shall
not
be
subject
to
grievance
and
arbitration
provisions
of
the
contract.
"
so
they
wrote
the
400
out
of
the
contract,
and
that
is
fair
representation?
i
would
think
not.
there
are
four
cases
which
predominantly
deal
with
torts
that
have
come
before
this
court:
linn
v.
united
plant
guard,
machinists
v.
gonzales,
motor
coach
employees
v.
lockridge,
san
diego
building
trades
council
v.
garmon,
and
farmer
v.
united
brotherhood
of
carpenters.
in
the
linn
case
upon
which
we
rely,
state
court
was
allowed
in
that
case
to
take
jurisdiction
of
and
adjudicate
differences
of
a
plant
manager
of
an
employer
who
sued
for
libel
against
the
union,
a
tort.
in
machinists
against
gonzales,
gonzales
sued
his
own
union,
and
the
court
in
that
case
said
there
was
no
infringement
of
any
apparent
wrong
or
any
apparent
deviation
of
the
power
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
because
the
state
court
had
only
to
consider
the
elements
of
the
union
constitution
and
nothing
to
do
with
the
strike,
and
he
recovered
in
that
case.
in
motor
coach
employees
versus
lockridge,
a
union
member
sued
the
union.
relief
was
denied
and
overturned
by
this
court,
with
fair
comment
that
had
the
state
court
been
able
to
consider
only
the
constitution
of
the
union
that
it
would
have
been
a
matter
which
they
had
jurisdiction
of;
however,
they
had
to
consider
a
security
clause
of
a
contract
and
had
to
rely
upon
that
for
adjudication,
and
the
court
felt
that
that
was
arguably
within
the
purview
of
the
nlrb.
so
motor
coach
employees
versus
lockridge
favorably
commented
upon
the
right
of
lockridge
to
sue,
but
denied
his
right
to
have
it
adjudicated
by
a
state
court,
on
the
theory
that
in
order
to
do
so
they
would
have
to
consider
and
comment
and
adjudicate
a
plant...
a
contract
security
clause.
in
san
diego
building
trades
council
versus
garmon,
the
holding
of
that
court
extensively
argued
the
theory
of
state
court
adjudication
and
decided
that
the
state
court
could
not
award
damages
for
peaceful
picketing,
a
matter
which
was
arguably
within
the
purview
and
preempted
by
the
act.
in
farmer
versus
united
brotherhood
of
carpenters,
a
union
officer
sued
in
tort
for
damages
and
the
court
in
that
case
favorably
commented
upon
his
right
to
sue
in
tort,
however,
reviewed
the
proof
and
decided
that
the
proof
called
for
the
state
court
to
rely
upon
apparent
unemployment
discrimination...
i
mean
employment
discrimination...
and
therefore,
while
the
court
sanctioned
the
right
of
the
state
court
to
adjudicate
pure
tort,
if
in
doing
so
the
state
court
had
to
pass
upon
an
employment
discrimination
matter
they
felt
that
that
was
arguably
within
the
jurisdiction
of
and
preempted
by
the
nlrb.
i'm
citing
these
because
i
think
that
these
five
cases
graphically
set
forth
what
the
court's
progress
up
to
this
time
has
been,
and
that
in
two
of
these
cases
state
courts
were
allowed
to
adjudicate
tort;
in
two
other
of
these
cases
the
state
court...
the
ability
of
state
court
to
do
so
was
approved,
however,
the
case
was
overturned
because
there
was
reliance
on
matters
which
was
arguably
under
the
preemption
doctrine
of
the
nlrb.
so
i'm
saying
it
is
our
position
that
tort
has
been
allowed
before,
tort
has
been
allowed
under,
for
a
better
expression,
thinner
cases
and
circumstances
than
this;
and
that
our
only
position
is
one
which
could
probably
be
summed
up
by
arguments
that
have
been
made
by
questions
from
this
court
far
better
than
i
would
ever
have
the
ability
to
do
so.
but
essentially
we
must,
i
feel,
give
some
attention
to
simple
propositions
of
law
which
i
learned
in
law
school,
and
that
is,
for
every
wrong
there
must
be
found
a
remedy.
state
courts
have
never
been
preempted
from
adjudicating
tort.
that
is
matters
which
were
reserved
to
the
state
court
by
the
tenth
amendment.
now,
to
the
extent
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
may
have
carved
out
areas
of
that--
mr.
cecil
davenport
--sir?
mr.
cecil
davenport
oh,
no,
no.
mr.
cecil
davenport
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
didn't
mean
to,
sir.
i
meant
that
tort
in
general
had
not
been
preempted,
that
certain
areas
of
tort
adjudication
have
been
preempted
by
the
nlrb.
and
essentially
all
of
the
relief
which
these
people
are
asking
is,
as
simply
put
forth
by
the
questions,
it's
no
imposition
upon
a
employer
to
go
out
and
hire
employees
and
tell
them
the
reasonable,
the
satisfactory
circumstances
under
which
they
will
be
employed,
and
that
they
may
have
to
be
terminated
at
such
a
time
in
the
future,
or
to
say
nothing,
for
that
matter;
but
not
to
overtly
advertise
something
that
it
knows
full
well
it
cannot
fulfil.
the
depositions
in
the
record
in
this
case
show
that
on
february
the
1st,
at
the
time
the
strike
began,
and
prior
to
that
time
there
had
been
meetings
with
their
attorneys
and
the
plan
to
hire
replacement
employees
had
already
been
put
into
effect.
the
employer
was
present
and
in
meeting
with
their
attorneys
when
the
language
of
the
advertisement
was
put
into
effect.
so
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
employer
was
saying
something
he
didn't
know
the
consequences
of.
the
employer
was
well
represented
at
that
time,
by
one
of
the
most
prestigious
law
firms
in
the
state
of
kentucky.
and
that
therefore,
when
you
overtly
go
out
of
your
way,
when
you
also
are
planning
to
give
a
raise,
when
you
most
assuredly
must
have
been
advised
that
to
do
so
is
to
create
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
then
to
hire
a
complete
set
of
employees
knowing
that
you
may
not
be
able
to
fulfil
those
obligations,
we
submit
is
a
matter
which
is
not
even
arguably
within
the
preemption
area
carved
out
by
congress.
thank
you.
