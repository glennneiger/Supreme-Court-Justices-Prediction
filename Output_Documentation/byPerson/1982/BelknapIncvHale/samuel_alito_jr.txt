mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
national
labor
relations
board
agrees
that
respondents'
state
claims
are
preempted
by
federal
law.
we
reach
this
conclusion
primarily
because
those
claims
would
frustrate
the
policy
of
federal
labor
law
by
interfering
to
an
impermissible
degree
with
one
of
the
chief
economic
weapons
granted
to
employers
in
labor
disputes,
that
is,
the
right
to
hire
permanent
strike
replacements--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
this
case
involves
any
dishonesty
on
the
part--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--an
employer
certainly
does
not
have
that
right
under
federal
law,
but
it
may
be
that,
and
we
contend
that
it
is,
it
is
the
case--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
we
maintain
that
suits
like
the
present
one
are
preempted.
but
i
think
it's
misleading
to
suggest
that
employers
can
engage
in
fraudulent
conduct
towards
strike
replacements.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
your
honor,
let
me
make
several
points
in
response
to
that.
first,
it
is
not...
it
is
not
a
false
promise
for
an
employer
in
this
context
to
state
to
a
strike
replacement
that
he
is
going
to
be
given
the
position
of
a
so-called
permanent
replacement.
that
is--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
don't
believe
it
was
erroneous,
your
honor.
it
is
a
term
of
art
in
federal
labor
law.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
that
might
be
the
case.
what
we
are...
that
might
also
be
the
case.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
this
case
there
was
no...
there
was
no
fraud
on
the
strike
replacements.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
yes,
i
am.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
but
if
you
look
at
the
complaint
and
you
see
what
the
basis
for
the
fraud
claim
was
and
the
basis
for
the
contractual
claim,
you
will
see
that
the
basis
for
the
fraud
claim,
and
as
far
as
we
can
determine
the
sole
basis
for
the
fraud
claim,
is
the
advertisement
that
belknap
placed
in
the
newspaper.
that
is
reproduced
as
an
appendix
to
the
brief
we
submitted
at
the
petition
stage.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
i
don't
want
to
belabor
the
characterization
of
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
simply
wanted
to
point
out
that
it
is
a
bit
misleading
to
suggest
that
this
case,
which
we
believe
is
typical,
is
an
instance
in
which
an
employer
is
even
alleged
to
have
engaged
in
what
is
really
fraudulent
conduct.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
don't
disagree
with
their
characterization
of
what
was
alleged.
i
think
it
is
apparent,
however,
from
the
face
of
the
complaint
that
what
is
really
at
issue
is
the
right
to
offer
"permanent
placements
to
strike
replacements".
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
said
an
employer
could
do
in
an
economic
strike.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
your
honor,
there
is
one
possible
remedy.
it
was
touched
on
this
morning.
it's
the
filing
of
a
claim
against
the
union
for
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
i
don't
want
to--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--we
contend
that
they
have
a
duty
to
represent
them
in
certain
respects.
but
the
point
that
i
really
want
to
make
in
response
to
that
question
is
that
the
filing
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
by
a
union
in
any
instance
in
which
an
employer
promises
more
than
federal
law
permits,
and
therefore
more
than
he
will
be
able
to
deliver,
will
probably
prompt
the
union
to
file
unfair
labor
practice
charges
and
that
will
serve
to
police
these
offers
by
employers
to
permanent
strike
replacements.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
it's
been
suggested
that
the
employer
has
a
duty
to
provide
some
sort
of
explanation
to
the
strike
replacements
as
to
what
their
status
is,
to
tell
them
something
more
than
that
they
are
being
employed
as
so-called
permanent
strike
replacements.
and
from
our
point
of
view
that
would
be
unworkable
and
really
intolerable,
if
an
employer
were
required
to
supply
a
prospective
strike
replacement
with
an
accurate,
comprehensive,
understandable
synopsis
of
the
rights
of
strike
replacements
and
strikers
and
employers
in
economic
strikes
and
unfair
labor
practice
strikes.
the
risk
of
misstatement,
the
risk
that
a
state
court
would
find
that
there
had
been
misstatement,
would
be
so
great
that
the
employers'
use
of
this
permitted
economic
weapon
of
hiring
permanent
strike
replacements
would
be
grievously
impaired.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
maintain
that
employers
are
permitted
to
offer
strike
replacements
permanent
employment,
as
this
court
has
held.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
see
that
as
a
different
question,
your
honor--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--because
it
does
not
interfere--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--because
the
strike
is
over,
for
that
very
reason.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
justice
white,
in
answer
to
that
question
and
another
question
that
was
asked
when
mr.
forrester
was
speaking,
we
certainly
don't
maintain
that
employers
are
given
carte
blanche
and
are
absolutely
free
from
the
constraints
of
state
law
to
promise
anything
to
anybody
in
the
name
of
maintaining
an
economic
weapon
during
a
labor
dispute.
and
i
think
that
is
analogous
to
a
fraudulent
promise
to
a
third
party.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
my
answer
to
that
question
is
that
that
is
a
different
case,
because
when
the
strike
is
over
there
is
not
the
same
degree
of
interference
with
a
permitted
economic
weapon.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
future
strikes--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--future
strikes
are
not
over,
and
if
it
is
known
that
state
actions
like
this
one
are
permitted
there
will
be
an
intolerable
degree
of
interference
with
an
employer's
economic
weapon.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
believe
that
would
be
preempted
on
the
same
theory.
i
think
that
certainly
involves
conduct
that
is
arguably
prohibited
by
section
8
and
would
be
preempted
under
the
garmon
rule.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
machinists
is
certainly
comparable
to
this
in
many
respects.
that
was
the
case
where
congress'
intent
not
to
permit
state
regulation
was
inferred
from
the
fact
that
burdening
a
particular
economic
weapon
would
frustrate
the
policies
of
the
act.
and
that
we
contend
is
what
would
happen
here.
thank
you.
