we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
the
case
of
belknap,
incorporated,
versus
duwaine
e.
hale,
et
al..
mr.
forrester,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
these
people
were
hired
was
there
any
kind
of
a
contract
that
would
preclude
their
being
discharged,
with
or
without
cause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
subjective
about
a
contract
of
employment
of
two
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
hypothesis
that
justice
rehnquist
gave
you,
i
thought
he
was
just
talking
about
a
flat-out
contract
for
two
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
might
come
into
play,
but
he's
made
them
a...
there's
nothing
subjective
or
ambiguous
about
an
employment
contract
for
two
years,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
why
can't
that
be
enforced
in
state
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
that
in
derogation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
hasn't
been
tried
yet
on
the
state
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
to
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
probability
or
a
possibility
that
a
contract
will
be
established
in
the
proceedings
in
the
future.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
anything
to
prevent
a
person
from
making
inconsistent
contracts
with
two
different
people
at
the
same
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
breaches
one
of
them,
then
he's
going
to
be
liable
on
that
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
alito.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
say
it
wasn't
false.
it
was
certainly
erroneous,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
position
must
be
that
no
suit
in
the
state
courts
in
these
circumstances
may
be
maintained,
whether
it's
for
fraud,
misrepresentation,
breach
of
contract
or
anything
else.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
test
your
position
with
a
slight
hypothetical
change
here.
suppose,
since
many
people
are
reluctant
to
break
a
picket
line,
the
employer
had
announced
in
that
announcement
that's
in
your
appendix
here
a
$500
premium,
special
payment,
will
be
made
for
all
replacements.
and
then
when
they
get
there
they
negotiate
and
agree
that
the
$500
payment
will
be
deferred,
but
they
all
go
to
work
just
as
they
did
here.
and
then
the
employer
doesn't
pay
the
$500,
independent
of
whether
he's
fired
them
or
not.
could
they
sue
for
that
$500
in
state
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
davenport.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--how
do
you
distinguish
in
terms
of
inducement
the
promise
to
give
permanent
employment
and
an
offer
to
give
an
increased
wage
to
the
replacement
people?
what's
the
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
might
be
stretching
it
a
little
bit
when
it
embraces
all
the
policies
of
the
labor
board
or
any
regulatory
agency,
but
are
they
not
obliged
to
know
the
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
if
the
law
is
as
the
labor
board
contends
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
your
position
on
that,
your
position
as
distinguished
from
the
board,
mean
that
an
action
for
tort
might
be
maintained
but
an
action
for
contract
could
not?
could
it
not
be
reasonable
that
recovery
or
a
suit
for
contract
alone
might
be
preempted,
but
a
suit
for
tort
for
fraud
would
not
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
in
this
context,
does
anyone
need
to
have
any
broader
definition
than
that
the
replacement
people
would
be
just
as
permanent
as
the
persons
they
replaced?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
doesn't
mean
a
contract
for
life,
like
life
tenure
judges.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
wouldn't
you
be
fully
protected,
your
clients
be
fully
protected,
if
the
case
went
to
trial,
and
let's
assume
hypothetically
that
first
the
court,
state
court,
decided
that
any
claim
under
contract
would
be
preempted,
but
that
he
went
to
try
the
case
on
a
fraud
theory,
on
tort,
and
gave
a
recovery.
your
clients
really
don't
care
whether
they
recover
on
contract
or
tort,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
some
states,
it
requires
clear
and
convincing
evidence
as
against
a
preponderance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
apply
in
your
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
belknap
against
hale
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
justice
white.
