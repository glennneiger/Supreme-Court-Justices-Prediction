justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
also
alleged
fraud.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing,
mr.
forrester,
that
an
employer
in
the
midst
of
what
he
knows
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike
wants
to
get
replacement
workers,
and
suppose
he
gives
each
of
the
replacement
workers
two-year
contracts.
that's
what
he
tells
them,
anyway,
although
he
may
know
in
the
back
of
his
mind
that
he
may
have
to
reinstate
the
strikers
by
some
sort
of
a
compromise
settlement
such
as
worked
out
here.
does
the
enforcement
in
state
court
by
the
replacement
workers
of
that
two-year
contract...
how
does
that,
arguably
or
otherwise,
interfere
with
the
national
labor
relations
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
doesn't
permit
employers
to
resort
to
fraud
or
breach
of
contract,
though,
in
dealing
with
a
group
of
employees.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say,
then,
that
a
replacement
worker
who
is
hired
by
the
employer,
the
employer
in
his
own
mind
knows,
i
am
probably
going
to
have
to
let
this
guy
go
in
about
three
months
but
i
really
need
him,
so
i'm
going
to
tell
him
he
can
have
the
job
for
two
years
because
he's
got
a
job
now
and
he
wouldn't
leave
it
if
i
told
him
it
was
just
for
three
months,
you're
saying
that
that
employee
has
no
cause
of
action,
tort
or
contract,
when
he
is
discharged
after
three
months,
in
state
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
my
question
was,
can
this
employee
sue
in
state
court
for
fraud
or
for
breach
of
contract?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
that
interfere
with
the
national
labor
relations
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
your
position
that
in
order
to
really
deal
with
the
union
and
fight
his
battle
during
the
strike,
all
bets
are
off
so
far
as
other
areas
of
the
law
are
concerned,
really.
the
employer
is
free
to
defraud
people
or
to
breach
contracts
with
third
parties
so
far
as
the
beginning
of
the
strike
is
concerned,
in
order
that
he
can
concentrate
his
maximum
effort
with
the
least
possible
financial
burden
on
the
union,
or
on
the
employer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
fraud?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
alito,
are
you
familiar
with
the
opinion
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
the
second
paragraph,
which
you
will
find,
i
believe,
on
page
1
of
the
appendices
to
the
petition,
after
the
beginning
of
the
paragraph
cites
the
names
of
the
parties,
it
says,
"the
action
alleged
fraud,
misrepresentation
and
breach
of
contract.
"
was
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
wrong
in
describing
the
action
that
had
been
filed
in
the
kentucky
trial
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
kentucky
have
the
same
sort
of
rules
of
procedure
that
the
federal
courts
do,
do
you
know?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
does,
certainly
any
number
of
amounts
of
evidence
or
theories
could
be
adduced
in
support
of
a
pleading
of
fraud.
you
don't
have
to...
you're
not
limited
to
a
particular
advertisement.
why
shouldn't
the
state
courts
have
the
right
to
find
out
what
the
case
is
about?
apparently
you
concede
that
many
kinds
of
fraud
would
be
actionable
in
state
court,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
do
say
that
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
when
it
described
this
action
as
alleging
fraud,
misrepresentation
and
breach
of
contract.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
presume
they
would
prefer
having
two
bases
for
recovery
rather
than
just
one.
