justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
at
that
point
the
union...
did
it
owe
any
duties
to
anybody
in
the
bargaining
unit
at
that
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wasn't
this
in
connection
with
negotiating
a
new
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
people
who
are
hired
as
replacements?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
here,
though.
not
here.
i
mean,
this
suit
is
against--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes,
against
the
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
did
make
the
promise--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you're
going
to
be
a
permanent
employee.
and
they
reiterated
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
broken
your
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you
don't...
that
doesn't...
that's
just
a
privilege.
that
isn't
an
obligation
which
you
have
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
it
may
be,
but
you're
not
obliged
to,
in
hiring
replacements,
to
say
they're
going
to
be
permanent.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
you're
privileged,
but
you're
not
obligated
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
suppose
there
hadn't
been
a
settlement,
but
the
employer
held
out
and
the
strike...
he
just
broke
the
strike
by
hiring
these
replacements,
all
of
whom
he
promised
permanent
jobs
to,
and
so
the
strike
was
over.
and
then
he
started
firing
these
people
he
had
promised
as
permanent
replacements.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
let's
just
assume
no
unfair
labor
practice.
nobody'd
even
filed
one.
it
was
just
an
economic
strike
and
the
employer
won.
he
hired
permanent
replacements
and
then
he
decided
that,
now
that
he's
hired
them
all,
he'd
like
to
take
back
some
of
the
old
workers
because
they
were
better.
so
he
just
fires
the...
do
you
think
he
could
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean,
may
be?
it's
either
yes
or
no.
if
it's
preempted
one
way,
it's
preempted
the
other,
it
seems
to
me.
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
giving
them
a
remedy
for
breach
of
contract
burdens
the
employer's
right
to
hire
replacements.
if
he
knows
he's
going
to
have
to
pay
for
his
promise,
he
won't
be
so
free
to
make
them,
and
that
burdens
his
right
to
hire
replacements.
that
has
to
be
your
argument,
and
it's
also
the
board's
argument,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
lying
about
it.
yes,
he's
going
to
be
deprived
of
the
right
to
break
his
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
an
interesting
piece
of
a
protected
activity.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
cynically,
but
all
he
would
have
to
do
to
protect
himself,
and
he
may
not
be
able
to
hire
replacements,
but
he
would
have
to
say:
look,
this
is
certainly
my
promise
to
you:
i'll
keep
you
if
i
can,
but
if
it
turns
out
that
i've
got
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
made
out
against
me
i'm
going
to
have
to
can
you.
that
maybe
is
a
big
burden,
but
i'm
not
sure
how
much
it
is.
apparently
the
board
thinks
it's
a
big
burden,
and
so
do
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
doesn't
if
he
wins
the
strike
and
he's
hired
replacements
who
aren't
a
member
of
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
just
straight
contract?
sure,
the
employer
is
free
to
use
economic
weapons,
but
why
shouldn't
you
say
he
is
free
to
use
those
economic
weapons
that
are
within
the
law?
and
certainly
promising
somebody,
somebody
a
two-year
job,
knowing
that
you're
going
to
can
him
if
you
make
a
settlement,
why
shouldn't
he
have
to
pay
for
breaking
his
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
even
worse.
there
was
the
promise
of
permanent
employment.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
required.
it's
just
your
privilege.
has
there
been
any
judicial
determination
with
respect
to
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
contract
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
the
case
is
presented
to
us,
there
was
a
promise
of
permanent
employment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
reiterated.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
concede
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
all
understand
that.
but
the
law
didn't
require
him
to
make
that
promise.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
say
that
this
is
preempted
because
there's
any...
that
the
employer
was
doing
something
that
was
expressly
prohibited
or
permitted,
protected
by
the
act
in
the
normal
sense
of
the
word?
you're
just
saying
this
is
an
area
in
which
congress
said
the
state
law
should
stay
out
of
because
you
ought
to
let
these
two
people
fight
it
out
in
the
trenches
just
by
any
weapons
they
want,
as
justice
rehnquist
said?
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
unfair
labor
practice--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that's...
let's
assume
that's
so.
that
still
leaves
the
question
of
the
people
that
the
employer
promised
to
hire
permanently;
and
what
has
the
board
got
to
do
with
that?
zero.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
couldn't
possibly
give
a
remedy--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
the
permanent
employees,
could
they,
to
the
permanent
replacements?
there's
just
no
remedy
they
could
give
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
really
doesn't...
you're
not
suggesting
that
there's
any...
that
the
employer
was
even
arguably
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice
with
respect
to
the
permanent
employees
that
he
said
he
was
hiring,
or
the
permanent
replacements?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be,
it
may
be.
but
it's
not...
say
one
of
the
permanent
replacements,
so-called
permanent
replacements,
came
in
and
filed
a
charge
with
the
regional
director
or
the
general
counsel
that,
this
employer
is
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice
against
me.
he'd
be
laughed
out
of
the
room,
wouldn't
he?
not
laughed;
he'd
just
say,
sorry,
take
this
down
to
the
state
court
and
file
your
suit
down
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
right
to
be
dishonest
in
the
process
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
right
to
promise...
the
right
to
make
a
contractual
promise
that
he
knows
he
may
not
be
able
to
keep?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
he
may
be
able
to
make
this
promise,
which
the
federal
law
may
prevent
him
from
keeping,
and
yet
he
is
not
liable
for
his
promise
to
somebody
else,
which
is
probably
or
perhaps
has
enticed
somebody
to
leave
another
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't...
let's
don't
talk
about
fraud,
then.
just
talk
about
contractual
promises.
you
say
they
are
free
to
make
a
promise
that
the
federal
law
may
keep...
prevent
them
from
keeping.
of
course,
the
federal
law
doesn't
prevent
them
from
keeping
it.
they
can
just
pay
up
for
their
promise.
they
just
stand
like
anybody
else
in
life
does;
if
he
breaks
his
contract
he
pays
damages.
he
can
reinstate
the
workers
like
the
federal
law
requires
him
to
do.
why
should
he
not
make
somebody
whole
that
he
has
damaged?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
so
you're
saying
anybody
who
has
had
that
promise
shouldn't
win
his
case
because
he
hasn't
been
promised
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
you've
just
argued.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
he
could
do
that.
of
course
he
can
do
that.
that
doesn't
mean
he's
not
liable
if
he
breaches--
--what
remedy
do
the
respondents
have
under
federal
law
if
they
have
no
remedy
in
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
answer
to
my
question
i
asked
your
colleague:
if
it's
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike,
there's
no
charges
filed
like
that,
the
strike
is
over,
the
employer
has
won
it.
he
has
promised
permanent
employment
to
replacements
and
then
he
cans
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
knowing
that
he
can't
fire
them
will
dampen
his
ability
to
offer
permanent
replacement
status
to
people
during
a
strike.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
suppose
there
are
unfair
labor
practice
charges
filed
by
the
union,
who
claim
that
he
committed
unfair
labor
practice
and
that
he's
offering
permanent
replacements
to
people
that
he
has
no
business
offering
them
to.
and
they
litigate
that
and
it's
found
that
the
employer's
committed
nothing,
no
unfair
labor
practice
at
all.
he
was
quite
permitted
to
offer
these
permanent
replacements.
and
then
he
fires
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
strike
is
over
now.
the
strike
is
over
now
by
a
settlement,
and
he
fires
the
replacements.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
all
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
know
of
any
other
cases
like
this,
where
you
just
say
it's
just
one
of
those
areas
a
state
court
should
stay
out
of,
it
isn't
specifically
arguably
prohibited
or
protected?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
davenport,
could
i
ask
you,
suppose
the
federal
labor
law
said
that
in
a
strike,
during
a
strike
until
it's...
at
least
up
until
a
certain
point
in
a
strike,
an
employer
may
hire
replacements,
but
he
may
not
hire
anybody
on
a
permanent
basis.
just
suppose
the
federal
law
said
that.
then
the
employer
nevertheless,
in
hiring
replacements,
promises
a
permanent
job.
now,
you
wouldn't
say
that
that
contract
would
be
enforceable
if
it's
just...
if
it's
an
illegal
contract,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
just
made
an
illegal
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
i
understand
the
submission
on
the
other
side
here,
that
when
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
is
pending
such
as
was
pending
in
this
case,
it
really
was
an
unfair
practice,
namely,
contrary
to
federal
law
to
promise
a
permanent
job,
in
which
event
if
that...
assume
that
it
turned
out
that
way,
that,
true,
there
was
an
unfair
practice
and
the
employer
should
not
run
around
hiring
permanent
replacements.
now,
it's
tough
on
the
400
replacements,
but
nevertheless
they
made
an
illegal
contract
with
the
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
argument
is
that
the
right
that's
being
protected
here
is
the
right
to
promise
permanent--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
even
if
a...
even
if
an
illegal
contract
isn't
enforceable
by
the
promisee,
if
the
other
side
has
also
committed
a
tort
against
him
he
can
sue
him
for
a
tort,
which...
this
suit
in
here
was
a
suit
for
fraud
as
well,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
fraud
claims
are
a
little
harder
to
prove.
justice
byron
r.
white
reliance,
and
things
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
really
mean
all
that,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
really
mean
that
the
state
courts
have
been...
can
adjudicate
any
kind
of
a
tort
without
preemption?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
just
what
you
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case,
petitioner,
belknap
inc.,
a
unionized
employer
was
struck
when
negotiations
for
a
new
contract
broke
down.
belknap
then
granted
a
unilateral
wage
increase
and
advertise
for
replacements
indicating
that
jobs
will
be
permanent,
replacements
were
hired
on
--
on
this
basis.
unfair
labor
practices
are
charges
within
file
and
belknap
assured
the
replacements
that
their
jobs
would
survive
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings.
nevertheless,
some
time
later,
belknap
settled
its
unfair
labor
practice
case
with
the
board
and
its
differences
with
the
union
as
well
and
in
the
process
agreed
to
reinstate
the
strikers.
this
was
done,
the
result
being
that
the
replacements
were
discharged
to
make
room
for
the
returning
strikers.
some
of
the
replacements
then
filed
a
suit
in
the
state
court
claiming
that
belknap
had
misrepresented
and
that
it
breached
its
contract
with
them.
the
trial
court
dismissed
the
case
on
the
grounds
that
the
challenge
conduct
was
arguable
protected
or
prohibited
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
hence,
the
suit
was
preempted
by
the
federal
law.
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
reversed,
holding
that
the
case
will
go
forward
because
the
--
because
it
fell
within
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
preemption
doctrine.
we
issued
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
for
the
reasons
that
we
given
in
an
opinion
available
in
the
clerk's
office.
we
hold
that
none
of
the
cases
relied
on
by
belknap
required
that
--
or
forbid
the
state
proceedings
to
go
forward.
accordingly,
the
judgment
is
affirmed.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
and
powell
have
joined.
