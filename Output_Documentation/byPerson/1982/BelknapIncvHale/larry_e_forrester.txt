mr.
larry
e.
forrester
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
january
of
1978
the
petitioner
belknap
employed
approximately
400
people
in
a
bargaining
unit
represented
by
the
teamsters
union.
on
february
1st
of
1978
the
teamsters
called
a
strike
of
the
bargaining
unit
because
the
parties
were
unable
to
agree
upon
the
terms
of
a
new
collective
bargaining
agreement.
on
that
same
date
belknap
advertised
in
the
local
newspaper
for
permanent
replacements
for
these
striking
employees.
simultaneously,
belknap
implemented
an
across
the
board
wage
increase
for
all
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit.
during
the
course
of
the
strike
there
were
unfair
labor
practice
charges
filed
against
belknap
and
by
belknap
against
the
union
for
conduct
occurring
on
the
picket
line.
in
april
of
1978
the
national
labor
relations
board
issued
a
complaint
against
belknap,
contending
that
their
unilateral
wage
increase
at
the
inception
of
the
strike
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
that
it
violated
belknap's
duty
to
bargain
with
the
union.
in
july
of
that
year,
before
a
hearing
on
these
unfair
labor
practice
matters
before
the
labor
board
occurred,
the
regional
director
for
the
labor
board
in
cincinnati
directed
the
parties
to
the
labor
dispute
to
attend
a
meeting
at
the
regional's
office
in
cincinnati
and
encouraged
the
parties
to
resume
negotiations
to
resolve
the
labor
dispute.
as
a
result
of
this
meeting,
concessions
were
made
by
both
parties
concerning
the
terms
of
their
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
were
compromises
made
by
the
union
and
by
the
employer.
the
ultimate
issue
between
the
parties
that
separated
them
was
the
status
of
the
strikers
vis
a
vis
the
status
of
the
strike
replacements.
it
was
belknap's
position
that
the
strike
replacements
would
be
retained.
the
union,
of
course,
contended
that
the
strikers
should
be
returned
to
work.
the
parties
were
unable
to
make
an
agreement
on
this
issue.
the
regional
director
for
the
labor
board
suggested
a
compromise
whereby
belknap
would
agree
to
recall
35
striking
employees
per
month,
even
though
this
may
require
that
the
replacement
employees
be
laid
off.
on
the
basis
of
this
compromise,
the
parties
reached
a
strike
settlement
agreement
and
settled
the
strike.
part
and
parcel
of
this
settlement
was
the
withdrawal
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
by
belknap
and
by
the
teamsters
union.
also,
related
state
court
litigation
concerning
strike
violence
during
the
course
of
the
strike
was
dismissed.
all
pending
litigation
was
dismissed
in
conjunction
with
the
strike
settlement
agreement.
after
this
settlement
agreement
was
consummated,
the
replacements,
represented
by
respondents
herein,
sued
in
state
court,
contending
that
their
layoff
occasioned
by
the
terms
of
the
strike
settlement
agreement
constituted
breaches
of
state
law
concerning
misrepresentation
with
regard
to
offering
them
permanent
employment
in
the
first
place,
and
also
breaches
of
contract
with
regard
to
terminating
their
employment
after
they
had
been
offered
permanent
employment.
the
trial
court
dismissed
these
state
claims
upon
the
grounds
that
they
were
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
reversed,
contending
that
the
subject
matter
concerned
a
matter
of
compelling
state
interest
and
was
of
only
peripheral
concern
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
ultimately
denied
discretionary
review,
and
it
raises
the
issue
for
this
court
whether
or
not
the
state
court
claims
are
preempted
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
i
know
of
no
such
case,
justice
brennan.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
i
know
of
no
such
case.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
the
union
owed
the
duty
of
fair
representation
to
all
members
of
the
bargaining
unit.
strike
replacements
are
of
course
members--
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
--yes.
regardless
of
the
existence
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
union
owes
duties
to
everybody
in
the
bargaining
unit.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
replacements
have
to
be
considered
members
of
a
bargaining
unit
if
they
are...
they
stand
in
the
stead
of
the
strikers.
the
union
represents
everyone
in
the
bargaining
unit.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
well,
there
is
certainly
a
conflict
among
the
strikers
and
the
replacement
workers.
but
the--
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
--there
was
no
suit
against
the
union
by
the
strike
replacements.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
this
suit
is
against
belknap.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
there
was
no
such
contract.
belknap
had
to
characterize
their
replacement
status
as
permanent
in
order
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
federal
law.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
they
did
make
the
promise.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
they
did
reiterate
it.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
they
did
allege
fraud,
but
that
was
not
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
they
could
sue
in
state
court.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
by
merely
saying
that
you
promised
them
permanent
replacement
status
and
then
entering
in
a
strike
settlement
agreement
permitting
them
to
be
discharged--
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
--they've
stated
a
cause
of
action.
under
federal
law,
however,
if
we
do
not
characterize
their
status
as
permanent,
then
we
may
not
assert
their
employment
status
against
any
striker
who
desires
to
return
at
any
time,
and
for
that
reason
we
are--
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
--well,
it's
a
substantial
economic
weapon.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
well,
we
are
privileged
to
do
so
under
mackay
radio.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
and
if
we
do
not
so
characterize
it,
we
do
not
have
that
economic
weapon.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
well,
i
suggest
that
a
state
court's
inquiry
into
the
subjective
motivation
of
an
employer
in
those
circumstances
substantially
interferes
with
the
line
of
preemption
cases
that
permit
employers
and
labor
unions
to
resort
to
economic
weapons
whenever
there's
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
i
agree
that
it
does
not
permit
that,
justice
rehnquist.
but...
nor
are
states
permitted
to
inquire
about
employer
motivations
or
union
motivations
in
exercising
their
economic
weapons
without
the
risk
of
damaging
the
worth
of
these
economic
weapons
in
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
promises
of
that
sort
may
conceivably
be
unfair
labor
practices,
inasmuch
as
the
employer
continues
to
have
the
duty
to
bargain
with
the
representative
concerning--
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
--it
is
our
position
that
he
cannot.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
because
whenever
a
state
court
is
permitted
to
inquire
into
the
subjective
motivations
of
an
employer
for
offering
permanent
replacement
status,
then
the
damage
to
that
economic
weapon
is
done.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
it's
the
intention
of
the
employer
with
regard
to
that
contract.
justice
rehnquist
was
suggesting
that--
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
--i
thought
justice
rehnquist
was
suggesting
that
the
employer
knew
that
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike
and
he
could
not
reasonably
offer
that
employment
contract.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
there
is
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
because
any
such
contract
which
would
be
in
derogation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
enforceable.
it's
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
prevails
over
any
individual
contract.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
well,
the
employer...
let's
assume
the
employer
enters
a
contract
for
two
years
as
you
suggest,
and
subsequently
negotiates
the
terms
and
conditions
for
that
unit.
then
the
promise
of
a
two-year
contract
goes
by
the
wayside.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
well,
in
the
context
of
this
case
the
board
would
have
pursued
the
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
there
may
be
a
cause
of
action,
depending
on
state
law.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
the
argument
is
that
he
will
be
effectively
deprived
of
the
economic
weapon
of
offering
permanent
employment
status
to
strike
replacements.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
i
suggest
that
the
likelihood
of
an
employer--
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
--i
suggest
that
the
likelihood
of
an
employer
being
in
a
position
to
cynically
predict
down
the
road
what
is
going
to
happen
in
a
labor
dispute
is
not
great.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
i
do,
and
the
problem
arises
either
in
that
context
or
another:
once
an
employer
determines
to
hire
permanent
replacements,
he
continues
to
have
the
obligation
to
bargain
with
the
union
about
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
for
members
of
the
bargaining
unit.
an
employer
would
be
substantially
disinclined
to
make
that--
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
--if
the
strike
is
over
and
no
bargaining
obligation
continues,
he
is
relieved
of
that
risk
and
that
responsibility
and
the
mandate
under
the
federal
labor
act.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
obviously,
there
is
some
sort
of
egregious
conduct
that
should
be
subject
to
state
law.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
in
the
context
of
this
case,
i
do
not
believe
that
was
an
element.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
well,
in
this
case
there
were
no
two-year
contracts.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
as
is
required
in
order
for
an
employer
to
preserve
that
economic
weapon.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
there
has
not
been.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
it
has
not
been
tried
yet.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
there
was
a
promise
of--
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
--and
reiterated.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
i
do
concede
that,
justice
white.
if
the
employer
had
not
done
so,
then
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
assert
the
rights
of
the
permanent
replacements
against
the
striking
employees.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
no.
it
permitted
him
to
do
so.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
if
there
is
a
contract
in
the
proceedings
in
the
future,
it
is
of
course
in
contrast
with
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
covers
the
same
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
nothing
to
prohibit
it.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
but
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
always
prevails
over
any
individual
employment
understandings
between
an
employee
and
his
employer.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
not
entirely,
justice
white.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
if
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
the
labor
board
contended,
that
the
strike
was
converted
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike
with
the
offer
of
the
wage
increase
on
the
1st
of
february,
then
the
mere
offering
of
permanent
employment
to
replacement
strikers
according
to
the
labor
board
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
the
regional
director
so
advised
belknap
in
their
conference
where
the
issues
were
settled.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
well,
it's
unlikely
that
the
board
has
unfair
labor
practice
jurisdiction
to
entertain
claims
of--
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
--unless--
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
--they
certainly
would
not
be
entitled
to
remedies
that
would
be
a
satisfactory
state
court
claim.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
if
in
fact
and
in
law
it
were
an
unfair
labor
practice
at
the
time
these
offers
were
made,
then
the
board's
position
is
that
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
offer
permanent
employment
status
to
replacements.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
i'm
not
sure
the
labor
board
would
say
that,
but
it's
unlikely
a
replacement
would
file
such
a
charge.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
the
issue
had
been
raised.
i
don't
know
at
the
time
that
the
bulk
of
the
replacements
were
hired
that
the
charge
had
been
filed
on
the
unilateral
increase.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
well,
it
is
clear
that
the
federal
issue
is
decided.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
the
only
issue
that
would
be
subject
to
exploration
with
regard
to
these
claims
is
any
question
of
fraud
underlying
an
employer's
motivation
in
offering
permanent
employment.
i
suggest
that
once
the
state
court
is
permitted
to
make
that
inquiry
in
the
context
of
a
labor
dispute,
then
the
harm
is
done,
because
any
state
in
the...
any
court
in
this
union
whenever
permanent
replacements
are
hired
may
inquire
as
to
what
the
employer
intended
and
there
is
no
longer
any
federal
privilege
as
we
understand
it
now
to
hire
permanent
replacements
without
risk
of
being
sued
in
state
court
for
fraud.
mr.
larry
e.
forrester
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
