justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
forrester,
may
i
ask,
do
you
know
of
any
cases
in
which
an
action
for
failure
properly
to
represent
has
been
brought
against
a
union
by
strike
replacements?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
neither
board
nor
state
court
or
federal
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet,
mr.
forrester,
how
is
this
striking
union
ever
going
to
meet
that
duty?
if
it
exercises
or
discharges
it
in
favor
of
the
strike
replacements,
then
isn't
it
denying
fair
representation
to
the
strikers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
why
i
wonder.
i've
just
never
heard
of
a
suit
by
strike
replacements.
well,
this
is...
was
there
a
suit
against
the
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--had
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
continued
to
attend,
you're...
and
you'd
been
found
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
you
may
have
been
subject
to
an
order
of
the
board
to
reinstate
the
strikers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
after
you
had
made
the
promises
of
permanent
employment
to
the
replacements?
