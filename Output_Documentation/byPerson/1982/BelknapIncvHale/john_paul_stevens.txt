exactly,
yes.
mr.
forrester,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
there's
an
issue,
isn't
there,
as
to
whether
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike
or
an
economic
strike
at
the
time
of
the
hiring
of
the
permanent
replacements?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
if
the
character
of
the
strike
would
have
any
impact
on
your
preemption
argument,
because
one
kind
of
strike
might
give
rise
to
an
arguable
violation
and
another
kind
of
strike
might
not.
and
if
that's
true
and
if
we
don't
yet
know
until
the
trial
is
had
what
kind
of
a
strike
it
is,
is
it
perfectly
clear
we
have
a
final
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
the
federal
issue
could
be
affected
by
any
of
the
proceedings
that
take
place
hereafter?
