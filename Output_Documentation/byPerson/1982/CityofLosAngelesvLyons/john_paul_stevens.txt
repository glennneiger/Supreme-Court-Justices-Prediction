justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
posture
of
what
we're
asked
to
review.
you
pointed
out
that
you're
interested
primarily
in
the
standard
of
review.
what's
before
us,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
preliminary
injunction--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
has
been
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
there
were
findings
made
by
the
district
court
which
were
also
affirmed.
do
you
question
any
of
the
findings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
asking
us
to
say
some
of
the
findings
are
clearly
erroneous?
for
example,
the
district
judge
found
that
the
use
of
the
bar
arm
and
the
carotid
artery
holds
engender
a
high
risk
of
irreparable
injury
or
death
as
presently
used.
do
we
accept
that
as
true
or
do
we
have
to
look
at
the
record
and
decide
it's
not
true?
you
will
have
an
opportunity
to
prove
this
at
the
full
trial,
as
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is,
you
brought
the
case
up
by
appeal,
rather
than
taking
advantage
of
the
normal
opportunity
of
a
trial
litigant
to
adduce
additional
evidence
at
the
trial
court
level
and
straighten
out
all
these
factual
matters.
as
we
get
the
case,
the
standard
of
review
for
us,
i
understand,
is
whether
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
trial
judge,
having
made
these
findings,
to
say
we'll
have
a
preliminary
injunction
subject
to
further
review,
and
you
develop
evidence
that
shows
that
he
went
too
far.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
that
no
one
would
have
standing
to
challenge
this
practice,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
one
could
challenge
it.
you
just
have
to
wait
until
people
get
hurt
and
then
they
can
sue
for
damage,
is
that
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
are
16
cases.
how
many
would
it
have
to
be
before
you
could
have
injunctive
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
merkin,
if
you're
talking
about
standing,
you
don't
have
to
get
killed
to
have
standing.
if
you
have
the
hold
applied
to
you
and
you
find
it
objectionable
and
if
it
is
an
invalid
police
procedure,
don't
you
have
a
right
to
sue
about
it?
isn't
the
proper
number
to
look
at
the
935
who
were
subjected
to
the
hold?
and
all
of
them
claim
it
was
an
improper
procedure.
at
least
they
theoretically
might
so
claim.
and
you
say
none
of
them
would
have
standing
unless
they
get
killed?
i
thought
you
said
they
could
sue
for
damages.
but
none
of
them's
going
to
have
a
suit
for
equitable
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
some
injury
to
everybody
who's
subjected
to
it,
isn't
there?
maybe
it's
not
enough
to
get
all
that
excited
about.
but
you're
talking
about
standing.
is
there
any
injury
whatsoever?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
only
935
people
have
been
hurt,
so
we
don't
think
there's
a
sufficient
probability
to
justify
anybody
having
standing
to
litigate,
to
challenge
the
practice?
are
you
serious?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
had
been
stayed,
hadn't
it?
the
injunction
had
been
stayed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
was
a
voluntary
decision,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
you
say
that?
excuse
me.
how
can
you
say
that
when
they've
said
ten
days
from
now
they
may
return
to
their
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
suppose...
you
don't
know
for
sure
what
the
judge
will
do,
if
you
have
to
prove
your
case
all
over
again.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
they
say,
we're
going
to
lift
it.
you
say,
well,
we
don't
care.
that's
somewhat
inconsistent
with
the
argument
you
made
a
little
while
ago.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
may
not
get
it,
and
you're
saying
you
don't
care
if
we
lift
the
one
that's
now
protecting
your
client.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
because
it's
been
stayed.
but
you
say
you
don't
even
ask
us
to
lift
the
stay.
you
just
say,
well,
just
dismiss
the
injunction,
i'm
confident
i
can
get
it
again
if
i
need
it.
it's
a
strange
posture
for
representing
a
client.
well,
isn't
it
essential
to
your
posture,
the
statement
that
you
really
don't
think
the
political
authorities
in
los
angeles
will
ever
reinstitute
this
procedure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
merkin,
do
you
think
we
could
safely
assume,
in
view
of
what's
been
said
in
court
today,
that
if
we
were
to
dismiss
the
write
as
improperly
granted,
that
your
opponent
means
what
he
says
and
he
would
just
go
in
and
move
to
dismiss
the
injunction
before
the
district
court?
you
don't
believe
him,
i
take
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's,
in
effect,
represented
to
the
court
that
he's
prepared
to
do
that,
as
i
understand
what
he
said.
and
it
seems
sort
of
silly
to
be
deciding
the
kind
of
a
case
in
which
obviously,
there's
some
difference
of
opinion
if
no
matter
what
we
do
he's
going
to
say
let's
vacate
the
injunction
and
then
you'd
probably
be
happy,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
couple
of
good
lawyers
would
be
able
to
settle
this
case
and
save
the
damage
issue
without
requiring
this
court
to
do
very
much
about
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
like
an
advisory
opinion
on
the
standing
issue
is
what
i
understand.
