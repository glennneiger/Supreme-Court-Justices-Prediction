justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
events
i
gather
there'll
be
no
outstanding
restraint
which
would
prevent
the
restoration
of
the
practice
if
the
commission
decides
to
restore
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
merkin.
isn't
the
answer
that
you
should
give
justice
o'connor
that
what
you
want
is
the
same
latitude
that
the
city
had
before
with
respect
to
the
use
of
these
holds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
everything
that
you
used
to
be
able
to
do,
you
want
still
to
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
want
us
to
say
that
you're
free
to
do
it,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
want
us
to
say
that
constitutionally
you're
completely
free
to
follow
the
practice
you
followed
before
you
were
enjoined?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
figure
appear
in
the
record,
mr.
merkin?
the
16
deaths
constitute
what
proportion
of
the
total
number
of
holds,
do
we
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
quite
understand.
would
we
vacate
the
injunction
and
dismiss
the
proceeding,
or
direct
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
then
as
far
as
you
would
go
would
be
vacate
the
injunction,
but
otherwise
let
the
lawsuit
proceed,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
your
suggested
disposition,
if
we
vacate
it
and
you
go
back
to
trial,
i
gather
all
of
the
issues,
constitutional
and
everything
else,
would
have
to
be
resolved
in
any
event
by
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance,
would
they
not?
wouldn't
you
in
the
damages
aspect
of
the
suit
raise
all
these
constitutional
questions,
the
validity
of
the
choke
holds
and
the
rest
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
a
1983
suit?
what
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
going
to
be
a
protracted
trial,
i
gather?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
going
to
be
a
long
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
city
indicates
it'll
go
on
for
a
very
long
time.
will
the
only
issue
that
remains
be
the
damages
issue
if
we
do
as
you
suggest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
mitchell,
am
i
right,
the
only
judgment
before
us
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
affirming
the
preliminary
injunction,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
was
another
judgment,
was
there
not,
that's
not
here
at
this
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
only
one
before
us
now
is
the
affirmance
by
the
ninth
circuit
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
do
we
do
with
the
other
one
under
your
submission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we're
not
dismissing
as
improvidently
granted
if
we
vacate
the
injunction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we're
not
dismissing
as
improvidently
granted
if
we
vacate
the
injunction,
are
we?
no,
you're
taking
action
on
the
merits
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
no.
what
other
judgment
is
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
only
one.
