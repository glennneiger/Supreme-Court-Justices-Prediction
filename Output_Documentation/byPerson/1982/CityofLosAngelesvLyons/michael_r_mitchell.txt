mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
should
be
dismissed
because
my
client
no
longer
needs
the
injunction
that
was
granted.
the
city
has
now
complied
with
the
terms
of
that
injunction
and
my
client--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--pardon?
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
no,
that's
not
correct,
justice
white.
there
was
another
death
in
april
of
1982
and
a
firestorm
of
public
criticism
that,
along
with
this
lawsuit...
i
believe
this
lawsuit
did
have
some
impact...
resulted
in
the
moratorium.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
after
entry
of
the
preliminary,
by
a
year
and
a
half.
so
for
a
year
and
a
half--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--the
injunction
has
always
been
stayed.
there
has
never
been
a--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
well,
your
honor,
it's
a
complex
question.
what
you
need
to
know,
of
course,
is
whether
or
not
that
citizen,
i
believe,
has
a
justifiable
fear
of
real
immediate
injury.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
well,
it's
certainly
not--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--no,
your
honor,
he
would
not,
because
that
policy
would
not
be
that
police
cars
collide
broadside
with
citizens'
cars.
the
policy
is
that
you
chase
people
that
you
need
to
chase.
in
this
instance
we
have
a
policy,
a
direct
policy,
that
you
choke
people
who
do
not
threaten
serious
bodily
harm.
that's
like
saying
you
take
your
car
and
run
it
into
a
citizen's
car.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
your
honor,
if
you'll
look
at
the
record,
the
city
training
officer
says
that,
mr.
speer...
his
deposition
is
at
page--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--it's
written
several
different
ways,
your
honor.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
at
number
74,
page
21,
30,
and
91
in
the
official
record,
and
the
training
bulletin...
the
training
bulletin,
at
the
city's
petition
for
cert,
41a
in
the
appendix.
it
says
"subdue
any
resistance".
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
well,
it's
not
the
city
policy
today.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
to
subdue
any
resistance
or
if
an
officer
felt
a
bodily
attack
was
going
to
be
made
upon
him.
that
was
the
city
policy
as
best
i
understand
it.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
absolutely.
but
in
the
case
of
adolph
lyons,
of
course,
presumably
the
officer
felt
that
something
was
about
to
happen.
presumably
he
felt
that
there
was
about
to
be
a
bodily
attack.
we
don't
really
know,
since
we
have
nothing
from
the
officers
in
the
case.
but
consider
the
position
of
adolph
lyons.
as
a
black
male
in
the
city
of
los
angeles,
if
you
take
the
statistics...
and
let
me
point
you
in
the
record
to
the
statistics.
the
only
ones
that
we
have
are
in
the
city
cert
petition
at
page
11.
it
shows
application
of
a
total
of
113...
1,013
strangle
holds,
with
a
total
of
six
deaths
in
the
period.
which
means
that
approximately
one
out
of
every
200
times
that
the
strangle
holds
are
applied,
a
death
will
result.
now,
i
submit
to
you
that
that,
plus
the
fact
that
they
are
quite
obviously
having
a
disparate
impact
on
the
black
male
population
of
los
angeles...
you
are
12
times
more
likely
to
be
strangled
if
you
are
black,
to
die
of
strangulation,
if
you
are
a
black
male
than
if
you
are
white.
and
12
of
the
16
deaths
have
been
black
males.
there
are
200,000,
approximately
200,000,
black
males
in
the
city,
and
they're
killing
approximately
2
per
year
with
strangle
holds.
we've
got
12
in
6-1/2
years.
if
you
take
those
statistics,
it's
a
simple
calculation
to
show
that
your
chances
as
a
black
male
of
being
strangled
are
one
in
500
versus
one
in
6,000
for
anybody
else
in
the
city.
so
adolph
lyons,
who
suffered
almost
death...
he
was
almost
death
number
17
in
this
case.
he
defecated
and
urinated,
he
lost
consciousness.
he
suffered--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--yes,
it
was,
for
a
traffic
violation.
he
suffered
this
conduct
and
is
terrified
that
he'll
suffer
it
again.
he
has
one
chance
in
500
of
being
stopped
and
choked
by
the
lapd,
and
if
he
is
one
chance
in
200,
because
one
out
of
every
200
times
they
choke,
of
dying.
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
the
black
population,
black
male
population
of
los
angeles,
to
suffer
that
continuing
threat.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor,
not
that
they
did
that
routinely.
and
we
haven't
developed
all
the
facts
yet.
there's
a
massive
amount
of
work
to
be
done
before
we
get
to
the
trial.
whether
they
do
it
routinely
in
traffic
stops
or
not,
we
don't
know.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
if
he
lives,
if
he
lives.
and
i
submit
that
the
risk
that
he
might
die
far
outweighs
the
possibility
that
he
might
be
satisfied
with
any
damage
action.
what
the
lapd
is
requiring
mr.
lyons
to
do
every
day
is
to
play
a
game
of
roulette
that's
a
very
unusual
one.
it's
one
where
the
lapd
says,
our
policy
is
you've
got
to
choose
a
number
with
this
roulette
wheel
with
100,000
places
as
your
chances
of
dying,
and
we're
going
to
spin
this
wheel
and
if
that
ball
should
fall
in
your
slot
you
die.
now,
that
kind
of
policy
is
different
from
one
where
it
says,
you
put
down
your
money,
we'll
spin
the
wheel
and
if
the
ball
falls
in
your
slot
you
lose
your
money,
because
the
next
day
you
can
go
back
into
court
and
say,
that
policy
is
a
taking
without
due
process
and
it's
unconstitutional.
it's
not
true
when
they
take
your
life.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
your
honor,
the
record
shows
that
apparently
several
of
them
were
under
the
influence
of
various
drugs,
and
that
may
have
well
contributed
to
their
deaths,
because
when
you're
under
the
influence
of
narcotic-type
drugs,
including
alcohol,
you're
insensitive
to
paint
and
so
when
a
police
officer
puts
a
choke
hold
on
you
and
seeks
to
obtain
your
compliance
by
causing
you
paint
like
that
bar
arm
control,
you
don't
feel
it.
and
if
you
don't
feel
it,
he
can
continue
to
give
pressure
before
you
stop,
and
you
die
by
virtue
of
that
insensitivity
to
pain.
so
those
are
especially
people
who
you
want
to
avoid
choking.
the
district
court
made
that
finding,
in
fact,
that
those
people
are
ones
who
are
very,
very
delicate.
now,
the
cases
that
the
court
seems
to
rely
on
in
terms
of
judging
whether
mr.
lyons
has
standing
do
not
involve
the
threat
of
death,
and
that's
what
distinguishes
them.
a
threat,
an
immediate
threat,
is
comprised
of
at
least
four
elements:
first
of
all,
you've
got
to
know
you're
threatened.
there's
got
to
be
some
real
probability
that
you're
going
to
be
subject
to...
the
threat's
going
to
be
carried
out.
and
there's
a
consequence
to
the
threat
as
well
as
an
immediacy
of
the
threat.
now,
the
consequence
is
what
in
many
cases,
it
seems
to
met
is
implicitly
assumed
but
never
expressed.
the
threat
of
death
as
a
consequence
is
much
different
than
the
threat
that
bail
will
be
too
high,
as
in
o'shea,
or
that
you'll
be
treated
discriminatorily
by
a
judge.
the
fact
that
the
philadelphia
police
department
doesn't
have
a
disciplinary
process
that
adequately
disciplines
police
officers,
as
in
rizzo,
doesn't
involve
a
threat
of
death,
a
direct
threat
that
we
can
calculate,
as
we
can
in
this
situation.
i
don't
think
anyone
in
this
room
would
like
to
trade
places
with
adolph
lyons
and
have
that
chance
that
they're
going
to
die.
you
can
avoid
deciding
the
case,
however,
and
you
have
in
the
past
on
many
occasions
avoided
addressing
complex
and
very
important
constitutional
questions,
on
the
grounds
that
my
client
no
longer
needs
the
injunction,
with
the
assurance
that
the
city
cannot
return
to
its
former
policy.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
because
i
have
seen...
and
it's
not
in
the
record...
the
massive
outrage
and
outcry
of
that
community.
i
just
simply
believe
it's
politically
impossible
for
the
city
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
not
in
the
least.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
i
can
say
it's
moot,
your
honor,
because
my
client
walks
the
streets
of
los
angeles
these
days
with
none
of
that
fear
that
he
had
before.
he
doesn't
have
the
standing
to
have
the
injunction
any
longer.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
he
has
no
controversy
any
more.
he
wants
to
settle.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
well,
there
are
several
counts
down
there
for
damages
that
remain.
the
damage
claims
would
remain.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
your
honor?
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
that
it
should
be
dismissed
at
this
point?
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
yes,
your
honor,
he
does.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
after
the
moratorium
was
imposed.
i
must
in
all
candor--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--i
haven't
spoken
to
him
this
morning,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
that
his
position
has
changed.
in
all
candor,
should
that
moratorium
be
lifted
on
november
the
12th,
we'll
be
right
back
in
the
district
court
and
we'll
want
that
injunction
that
day.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
justice
rehnquist,
there's
chances
that
they
could
do
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
different
things.
i
can't
speculate
as
to
what
the
police
commission
is
going
to
do.
but
i
don't
think
this
court,
not
this
court,
should
concern
itself
with
a
case
like
this
where
it's
involving--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--your
honor,
the
way
the
complaint
is
drafted,
those
are
not
raised
with
respect
to
the
primary
count,
count
one.
we
would
in
fact
have
to
prove,
i
suppose,
that
it
was
a
taking
of
my
client's
right
to
liberty
without
due
process.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
in
this
specific
instance.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
yes,
it's
a
1983
suit.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
take
that
position
at
all.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
since
1977,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
your
honor,
i
think
this
case--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--your
honor,
if
it's
lifted
we
will.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
yes,
we
will.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
no,
your
honor.
i
think
this
case--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--your
honor,
my
understanding
is
that
on
the
9th
of
november
the
police
commission
must
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
the
moratorium
is
lifted
or
not.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
no,
your
honor.
i
misspoke
if
i
said
that.
i'll
be
in
court
on
november
the
10th,
the
day
after
november
the
9th,
to
get
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
this
one
has
never
been
in
effect.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
indeed.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
precisely.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
standing
to
be
here
today?
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
because
the
city
has
changed
its
policy.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
and
now
it
only
chokes
when
it
should.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
absolutely.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
with
that
calendar,
probably
not
until
next
summer,
late
spring.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
yes,
your
honor,
i
expect
it
will
be.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
yes,
your
honor,
assuming
the
moratorium
is
not
lifted,
absolutely.
the
question
of
federalism,
it
seems
to
me
in
this
case,
that
has
been
raised
by
the
city
is
not
a
real
question
any
longer.
the
city
claimed
that
this
injunction,
if
issued,
would
completely...
cause
them
to
completely
revamp
all
their
training
procedures,
spend
a
great
deal
of
money.
and
now
the
city
on
its
own
in
may
of
'82
has
done
precisely
what
the
injunction
required,
did
it
with
great
ease.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
way
they
raised
the
question
addresses
the
issue
of
federalism
that
concerns
adolph
lyons,
which
is
that
the
constitution
is
the
principle
of
federalism
that
he
was
seeking
to
be
protected
by.
he
wanted
to
be
protected
from
deprivation
of
his
life
without
due
process
of
law.
that's
the
principle
of
federalism
that
he
was
concerned
with,
and
there's
no
other
principle
of
federalism,
it
seems
to
me,
that
in
any
way
makes
a
local
police
department
immune
from
this
federal
protection
for
the
citizen.
the
city
would
have
this
court
institute
a
policy
that,
no
matter
what
policy
the
city
had,
the
federal
judiciary
would
be
powerless
to
enjoin
the
policy.
if
adolph
lyons
does
not
have
standing
to
challenge
this
policy,
there's
absolutely
no
one
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
who
did,
and
he's
the
man,
he's
one
of
the
men,
who
was
almost
killed
by
it.
so
if
you
do
not
dismiss
as
improvidently
granted,
vacating
the
injunction--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
justice
brennan,
there
was
a
lyons
i,
if
you
like--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--where
the
court
did
reinstitute
the
lawsuit.
it
had
been
dismissed
because
of
the
standing
problem.
so
there
are
two
judgments.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
no,
your
honor,
i
think
they're
both
before
you
now.
those
were
issues
presented
in
the
petition
for
cert.--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--well,
if
you
dismiss
as
improvidently
granted
and
vacate
the
injunction,
you
needn't
do
anything
else.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
indeed.
you
could
order
it
remanded
for
vacation
of
the
injunction.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
that
wasn't
the
words
i
heard
justice
white
read.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
the
essence
is
to
subdue
any
resistance.
that's
what
the
bulletin
says.
and
that
means
subdue
all
resistance,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
mr.
justice
white,
a
police
officer
may
subjectively
feel
that
it's
necessary
for
him
to
choke
a
black
man
on
the
streets
of
los
angeles
because--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--well,
combined
with
the--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
the
other
statements
in
the
record--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--well,
i
don't
think
you
should
leave
people
to
a
damage
remedy
in
a
situation
like
this,
not
with
this
overwhelming
threat.
so
if
you
do
not
dismiss--
mr.
michael
r.
mitchell
--well,
it's
gone,
and
hopefully
it'll
be
gone
forever.
thank
you.
