we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
city
of
los
angeles
against
lyons.
mr.
merkin,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

e.
burger
subject
to
being
sued
by
people
who
are
injured.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
the
answer
to
the
question
that
the
decedents'
representatives
would
have
the
same
right
as
though
a
police
car
had
negligently
run
them
down
on
the
street
and
killed
them
in
the
our
suit
of
someone
else?
do
you
consider
murder
and
negligence
on
the
same
level?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mitchell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mitchell,
from
my
point
of
view
the
threshold
question
here
is
the
standing
to
bring
this
case.
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
to
see
if
it
will
shed
any
light
on
it.
there
is
a
good
deal
of
debate
in
police
circles
and
public
circles
about
the
hot
pursuit
by
police
cars,
and
sometimes
that
spills
over
into
the
speed
of
fire
engines.
but
confining
our
hypothetical
to
the
hot
pursuit,
where
police
will
pursue
a
bank
robber
or
whatever,
and
frequently
injure
other
people,
citizens,
or
kill
them,
do
you
think
a
citizen
who
is
fearful
of
that
has
standing
to
go
into
the
courts
and
stop
the
practice
of
hot
pursuit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume,
then,
that
on
one
occasion
a
police
car
in
hot
pursuit
collided
with
his
car
and
did
very
substantial
damage
and
injured
him.
now,
with
that
addition,
does
he
have
standing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
other
than
for
damages?
damages,
clearly
he
has
a
claim.
does
he
have
standing
for
equitable,
injunctive
relief
to
change
the
practice
of
the
police
or
the
fire
department?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
record,
mr.
mitchell,
about
the
conduct
of
these
various
people
that
had
the
fatal
consequences?
that
is,
were
they
intoxicated,
under
the
influence
of
drugs,
or
how
did
they
react
to
the
police
encounter?
what
does
the
record
show
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
will
you
get
to
trial
on
your
case
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
down
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mitchell,
if
every
policeman
on
the
beat
had
carried
out
the
instructions
in
the
manual
that
justice
white
read
earlier
in
the
argument,
would
there
be
any
problem,
that
is,
that
it's
used
only
when
it's
necessary
to
subdue
violence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
the
essence
of
it,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
merkin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me,
mr.
merkin.
will
you
tell
me
what
do
you
think
is
before
us?
you
brought
the
case
here.
what
judgment
is
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
is
stayed
by
the
courts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
narrows
your
complaint
down
to
the
standing
issue,
then,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
you'll
get
a
different
panel
in
the
ninth
circuit
next
time.
[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
justice
white
has
the
judgments
and
opinions
in
several
cases
to
announce
for
the
court.
