a
number
of
them,
aren't
there?
justice
byron

mr.
merkin,
the
policy
of
using
these
control
holds
is
based...
is
expressed
in
the
regulations
or
the
training
manual,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
are
authorized
only
in
order
to
overcome
resistance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
policy.
that's
the
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
an
officer
free
to...
according
to
the
policy,
is
an
officer
free
to
apply
a
control
hold
to
a
person
he's
arresting
for
a
traffic
offense
who
is
entirely
peaceful?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
violate...
that
would
violate
the
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
a
person
to
whom
the
control
hold
is
erroneously
applied,
erroneously
in
terms
of
what
he's
told
to
do,
would
a
person
who
is
subjected
to
that
kind
of
control
hold
have
a
cause
of
action
under
california
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
do
you
think
the
injunction
forbids
the
use
of
the
control
holds
at
all?
is
that
what
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
do?
it
says,
just
please
obey
the
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
training
bulletin
says:
"control
holds
should
be
used
only
when
necessary
to
stop
a
suspect's
resistance.
"
now,
the
injunction
thought
that
that
was
too
lenient
a
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you're
looking
at
the
city
policy
or
what
the
rules
are,
the
governing
rule
about
the
control
holds,
a
person
is
not
going
to
have
a
control
hold
applied
to
him
unless
he
resists.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
what
the
training
manual
says?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
have
to
count...
as
far
as
the
city's
liability
is
concerned
or
as
far
as
the
validity
of
the
policy
is
concerned,
the
control
hold
is
only
applied,
supposedly,
if
there's
been
resistance
to
the
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
again...
again,
my
question
still
stands.
as
far
as
the
policy
is
concerned,
control
holds
are
authorized
only
when
there's
resistance,
when
it's
necessary
to
use
force.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
person
to
be
arrested
or
confronted
is
entirely
peaceful,
there
would
never
be
an
occasion
to
use
a
control
hold,
as
far
as
the
policy
is
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
violation
of
the
regulation,
or
it's
a
violation
of
his
duty.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
terms
of
standing,
in
terms
of
showing
some
future
risk
to
himself,
he
would
have
to
show
that,
not
only
that
he
is
liable
to
be
stopped
for
a
traffic
incident
again,
but
another
policeman
is
likely
to
disobey
his
orders.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
if
it's
applied
according
to
policy,
the
predicate
for
that
is
that
he
resists.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he
resists,
and
in
short
that
he
is
committing
an
illegal
act
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
same
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
no
class
certification
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
like
to
cease
complying.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
like
to
cease
complying.
i
take
it
if
it
ceased...
it
revoked
or
suspended
the
rule
only
under
the
force
of
the
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
did
the
moratorium
occur,
before
or
after
the
entry
of
the
preliminary
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
rule
is,
as
i
understand
it,
the
rule
is
that
you
are
not
supposed
to
apply
these
control
holds,
you're
not
supposed
to
choke
them,
unless
it's
necessary
to
overcome
resistance.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
policy
written
or
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
41a,
is
that
policy
the
city
policy
or
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
was
it?
that
is
the
policy?
that's
an
adequate
description
of
the
policy?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
a
person...
if
an
officer
simply
applies
the
control
hold
for
no
reason
whatsoever,
he's
disobeying
his
instructions.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
object,
then,
to
vacating
the
injunction?
it's
been
stayed.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
don't
know
when
the
stay
expires.
when
we
get
through
with
this
case,
i
suppose.
but
you
would
not
object
to
our
vacating
the
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
would
we...
on
what
basis
would
we
vacate
the
injunction,
that
the
case
is
just
not
ripe?
you
can't
say
it's
moot,
can
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
how
we
can
do
that,
how
we
have
all
that
knowledge
of
what
the
reality
is
in
los
angeles.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
specific
instance.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
also
is
very
relevant
to
your
standing,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
ask
for
an
injunction.
you
say
that
you
don't
need
any
protection,
that
the
threat
to
you
is
nonexistent
in
the
future.
so
you
don't
need
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
not
only
has
changed
its
policy,
but
you
say
you
have
no
fear
with
respect
to
its
present
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
need
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
says
"necessary
to
subdue
resistance",
"necessary".
not
just
when
it's
applied
for
the
purpose
of.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
the
bulletin
says.
it
says
"necessary"
and
it
doesn't
say
if
the
officer
feels
it's
necessary.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
objectively.
it
may
be
an
objective
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
you'll
find
out
in
your
trial.
you'll
find
out
in
your
damage
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
overwhelming
threat
that
you
say
you
don't
need
any
protection
against
any
more.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
a
special
standing
issue
even
in
that
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
didn't
take
action
on
that
motion.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
first
case
is
city
of
los
angeles
against
lyons
which
is
here
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
case
began
when
lyons
--
the
respondent,
lyons
filed
a
complaint
in
united
states
district
court
alleging
that
several
months
earlier
he
had
been
stopped
for
a
traffic
violation
and
that
then
without
any
provocation
or
legal
excuse,
the
officer
involved
had
choked
him
into
unconsciousness
and
that
he
feared
that
the
same
thing
would
happen
over
again.
he
sought
in
separate
counts
both
damages
and
an
injunction
against
the
use
of
any
of
the
departmentally
authorized
chokeholds
except
where
the
officer
is
threatened
or
was
threatened
with
deadly
force.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
injunctive
count
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
the
district
court
then
entered
an
injunction
which
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
although
lyons
had
ample
standing
to
seek
damages
from
what
happened
to
him,
he
did
not
have
standing
to
seek
the
injunction
which
he
sought
or
which
was
entered
by
the
district
court.
so,
we
reverse
the
judgment.
justice
marshall
joined
by
justices
brennan,
blackmun,
and
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
