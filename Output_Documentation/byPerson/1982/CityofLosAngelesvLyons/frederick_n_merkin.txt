mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
important
constitutional
questions
of:
under
what
circumstances
may
an
individual
seek
protection
from
the
federal
district
court
against
local
law
enforcement
agencies
relative
to
the
force
techniques
that
the
officers
of
those
agencies
may
in
the
future
apply
against
such
individual?
the
case
also
concerns
the
circumstances
where,
if
the
court
is
going
to
entertain
such
a
plea,
the
federal
judiciary
may
assume
control
over
the
force
techniques
utilized
by
local
law
enforcement
agencies.
i
think
at
the
outset
it's
important
to
acknowledge
what
is
almost
obvious,
namely
that
the
situations
faced
by
police
officers
on
the
streets
are
often
difficult
ones,
and
sometimes
situations
that
most
of
us
are
unable
easily
to
relate
to.
secondly,
from
the
governmental
standpoint
the
issues
are
also
quite
complex
and
difficult
and
often
deal,
when
you're
speaking
of
use
of
force,
with
the
kinds
of
questions
that
are
often
faced,
for
example,
in
deciding
upon
military
tactics.
these
are
very
difficult
of
resolution.
now,
there
are
really
two
decisions
from
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
are
at
issue
here,
and
the
city
of
course
submits
that
they
were
erroneously
reasoned.
but
before
going
to
the
defects,
the
most
important
and
significant
defects
in
the
reasoning
of
those
two
opinions,
it
may
be
helpful
to
have
some
background
in
this
matter,
in
particular
with
reference
to
recent
developments
which
may
or
may
not
affect
the
justiciability
of
the
case.
as
you
probably
know,
the
city
believes
that
the
case
is
not
moot
and
needs
to
be
resolved.
but,
beginning
with
the
beginning,
about
five
and
a
half
years
ago
the
respondent
mr.
lyons
filed
an
action
in
federal
district
court
seeking
both
a
declaration
and
an
injunction
against
the
los
angeles
police
department
to
limit
the
use
of
the
unconscious-rendering
control
holds
to
situations
where
an
officer
is
faced
with
deadly
force.
we
submit
that
that's
the
effective
prohibition
of
such
holds.
and
his
primary
theory
and
the
theory
that
developed
was
that
the
control
holds
shock
the
conscience.
and
the
respondent's
position
is
that
the
control
holds
shock
the
conscience
intrinsically,
having
little
to
do,
if
anything,
with
the
training
of
the
officers,
but
they're
intrinsically
of
the
kind
that
shock
the
conscience.
now,
the
control
holds
of
which
we
speak
are
neck
restraints
that
are
really
of
two
different
fundamental
varieties.
the
first
are
techniques
that
officers
apply
with
their
arm
on
both
sides
of
the
neck,
to
put
pressure
on
the
carotid
arteries
which
transmit
oxygenated
blood
to
the
brain.
the
second
family
are
techniques
known
as
arm
restraints,
which
rely
pressure
of
the
forearm
against
the
front
of
the
neck
and
the
tracheal
tube.
the
purpose
of
both
of
those
techniques
is
to
assume
control
of
the
individual,
and
in
the
vast
majority...
and
the
record
demonstrates
this...
people
submit.
they
do
have
the
potential,
as
the
record
reflects
and
the
district
court
found,
of
rendering
people
unconscious
if
necessary,
whereupon
they
can
be
turned
onto
their
belly,
which
is
the
typical
approach,
and
handcuffed
such
that
that
person
is
now
in
control.
now,
these
are
techniques
that
officers
are
trained
in,
but
they're
relatively
infrequently
applied.
we're
speaking
of
thousands
upon
thousands
of
encounters
between
police
officers
and
citizens,
and
in
a
large
city
such
as
los
angeles
we're
speaking
of
a
tremendous
number
of
arrests.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
the
case
need
not
be
decided
on
training,
this
case
need
not.
the
district
court
certainly
had
that
issue
before
it,
but
the
fundamental
error
here
is
legal.
more
specifically,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it
has
to
do
with
the
legal
standards
that
were
demanded
of
the
district
court
upon
review
in
the
lyons
ii
decision,
as
we
call
it,
the
review
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
look
for
the
application
of
the
appropriate
legal
standards,
and
those
legal
standards
of
which
i
speak
and
they
are
really
quite
related.
one
is
the
standard
that
derives
from
principles
of
federalism
and
equity,
which
says
that
the
federal
courts
should
only
assume
control
over
the
activities,
let's
say,
of
a
police
department
in
the
most
extraordinary
circumstances.
secondly,
to
have
a
constitutional
violation
here
the
court
had
to
find
that
the
tactic
shocked
the
conscience.
that
too
requires
in
effect
the
most
extraordinary
type
of
conducts.
indeed,
i
believe
in
a
concurring
opinion
you
wrote,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
outrageous
conduct
is
what
triggers
the
constitutional
violation.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
there
are
deaths
in
the
record,
yes.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
there
are
indeed.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
there
are
at
least,
yes.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
yes.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
that's
right.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
i
don't
know,
and
i
don't
know
that
the
city
knows.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
i
don't
know,
and
part
of
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
city
submits
that
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
subject
to
reasonable
debate,
indeed
there's
a
debate
going
on,
not
just
within
city
government
but
to
some
extent
nationwide;
and
that
these
decisions,
especially
in
this
particular
situation,
are
such
that
there
may
be
tentative
decisions
such
as
we
have
already
now
from
the
city
of
los
angeles,
that
are
subject
to
change
and
modification.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
yes.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
yes,
and
i
can
tell
you
a
little
bit
about
how
and
on
what
basis
that
decision
will
be
made,
i
believe.
the
controlling
authority
over
the
los
angeles
police
department
is
a
five-member
board
of
police
commissioners,
who
are
civilians
appointed
by
the
mayor
and
confirmed
by
a
15-member
city
council.
that
board,
if
it
has
all
five
at
the
session
that
takes
up
the
issue,
will
decide
by
majority
vote
what
policy
to
follow.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
no.
i
have
no
indication
that
that
is
their
desire.
my
most
recent
information
is
as
follows.
i
did
recently
file
a
memorandum
indicating
that
they
were
going
to
take
up
the
matter
one
week
from
today.
my
most
recent
information
is
it
will
probably
be
later
this
month,
but
i
do
not
have
a
specific
date.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
that
is
correct,
and
the
commission
and
the
city
government
as
a
whole
believes
that
these
tactics.
they
may
or
may
not
be
good
tactics.
reasonable
people,
reasonable
chiefs
of
police,
reasonable
experts,
can
differs
and
so
long
as
that's
the
case
we're
not
in
the
extreme
situation
where
reasonable
people,
reasonable
people
who
are
informed
and
have
reflected
on
the
subject,
are
going
to
concur
that
these
tactics
are
not
civilized,
they're
barbaric,
and
they
cannot
be
tolerated
in
this
society.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
i
think
the
policy
is
derived
from
two
different
notions.
the
first
is
the
standard
that
is
referred
to,
the
shock
the
conscience
standard--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--returning
to
the
description
of
the
control
holds
themselves,
the
latitude
that
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
we
speak
of
is
to
use
the
holds
in
circumstances
such
as
they
were
most
recently
used
before.
now,
that
is
one
possibility,
but
the
city
government
has
yet
to
decide
that,
if
it
chooses
to
use
the
holds,
whether
it
will
want
that
extent
of
latitude.
it
may,
for
example,
compromise
and
may
prescribe
the
holds
are
to
be
used
in
some
circumstances
but
perhaps
not
in
others.
but
i
think
they
want...
the
city
government
wants
the
full
constitutional
latitude.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
that
is
a
reasonable
approach,
but
it's
not--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--that
is
what
the
court
said,
but
the
court--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--the
district
court
did
make
that
determination,
yes.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
there
are
two
problems.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
there
are
two
problems
wrong
with
that,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
first
is
the
notion
of
what
is
a
threat
of
serious
bodily
harm
is
ambiguous.
and
the
policy
that
was
followed
by
city
government
up
to
that
point
was
broader.
there
were
circumstances--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--yes.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
constitutionally,
yes.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
well,
that
the
policy
that
was
followed,
yes.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
subject
to
being
sued
and
defending
those
suits
in,
for
example,
a
damages
action
brought
under
the
monell
decision.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
well,
the
individual,
the
deceased
him
or
herself
does
not
have
any
personal
recourse,
of
course.
they
are
very
unfortunate
situations
when
people
die.
but
when
it's
a
remote
consequence...
if
we
were
to...
if
the
court
were
to
formulate
a
rule
that
a
person
fearful
of
a
remote
consequence
can
get
an
injunction,
then
so
many
of
us
who
fly
airplanes,
for
example,
do
all
kinds
of
things,
walk
just
the
streets--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--no,
we
do
not.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
yes.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
yes.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
you
could
make
two
determinations
of
clearly
erroneous
findings,
but
you
need
not
do
that.
you
need
not,
to
support
the
reversal
of
the
ninth
circuit,
make
those
determinations
or
even
quibble
with
the
facts.
what
you
can
do
is
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
should
have
been
looking
for
some
particular
things.
for
example,
one
thing
it
should
have
looked
for
was
a
finding
that
there
was
a
clearly
superior
alternative;
moreover,
that
this
clearly
superior
alternative...
and
there
had
to
be
some
gross
disparity
between
the
alternative
and
the
technique
before
the
officer...
was--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--mr.
justice
stevens,
to
that
i
would
say
there
are
really
two
issues
we
brought
to
the
court.
the
standard
is
one,
but
the
other
is
standing.
this
trial
would
be
of
gargantuan
proportion,
and
the
review
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
then
ultimately
perhaps
by
this
court
might
be
years
in
the
coming.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
by
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief,
no.
but
there
are
other
remedies,
not
only
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
has--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--because
it
is
remote.
if
it
were
not
a
remote
consequence.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
i
can't
give
you
a
mathematical
formula,
mr.
justice
stevens.
but
i
think
we
can
distinguish
between...
when
a
person
has
reason
to
be
anxious
walking
down
the
street
in
some
town
or
city,
there
you're
really
fearful
of
your
encounters
with
the
police,
and
we
must
apply
an
external
standard:
is
a
person
being
reasonable
in
such
fear?
there
there's
a
serious
problem
indeed
in
that
community.
but
when
you're
talking
about
a
remote
consequence...
now,
there
are
16
deaths
that
have
been
ascribed
to
the
control
holds
out
of
literally
thousands
of
applications
of
the
control
holds.
now,
the
city
is--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--we
know
by
extrapolation.
there
is
in
the
record
the
following
calculation,
that
in
one
18-month
period
the
control
holds
were
applied
935
times
and
that
the
respondent
contends
that
3
people
died.
we
calculated
that
that's,
i
think,
a
percentage
of
0.31
percent
of
the
individuals
die
maximum.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
you
cannot
sue
for
equitable
relief
in
circumstances
where
the
threat
of
injury
is
so
remote.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
there
is
a
possibility
of
injury
indeed,
okay.
but--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--we're
talking
about
the
constitution.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
and
the
constitution
talks
about...
truly,
it
speaks
relatively,
i
think,
in
this
area,
the
compared
to
what.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
but
see,
i
think
standing...
and
the
court's
decisions
seem
to
suggest
this,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
stevens,
require
that
the
threat
to
the
individual
be
quite
meaningful.
and
it's
going
to
be...
the
individual's
going
to
be
fearful
rationally--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--you
can
object,
certainly.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
one
of
the
points
we
did
make
in
response
was
we're
speaking
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
case
or
controversy.
and
while
it's
true
that
the
recent
city
policy
conforms
to
more
or
less
what
the
respondent
is
asking
for,
that
may
change
and
it
may
change
quickly.
it
could
change
this
month,
it
may
not.
it
may
change
in
three
months,
it
may
change
before
the
matter
comes
to
trial.
it
may
not.
we're
speaking
of
a
very
fluid
situation
at
this
moment.
but
in
any
event,
one
of
the
fundamental
problems
is
that
we're
speaking
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
case
or
controversy
to
begin
with,
and
the
sooner
that
that
kind
of
issue
is
resolved
the
better
it
is
for
the
judicial
system
to
dispose
of
cases
that
are
advisory
in
nature.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
yes.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
yes,
generally.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
that's
not
the
full
panoply
of
the
policy.
it's
a
little
more
specific
than
that.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
of
course
not.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
it
would
be
out
of
policy
indeed,
mr.
justice
white,
and
probably...
it
could
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
yes.
if
the
amount
of
force
that
was
applied
was
not
reasonable
and
necessary,
then
there
is
an
action
under
california
law.
the
penal
code
sets
that
standard
for
california
peace
officers.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
no.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
it
rewrites
the
regulation.
it
says
that
you've
allowed
too
great
a
latitude
in
when
these
holds
can
be
applied
and
we
want
to
limit
it
to
really
serious
threats
to
an
officer.
the
immediate
response
to
that
is,
when
an
officer
is
faced
generally
with
a
serious
threat...
and
that's
where
the
definition
of
serious
bodily
harm
comes
in...
then--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--apparently
so.
but
there
are
circumstances
where
an
officer
has
yet
to
be
in
a
situation
where
he
or
she
is
faced
with
a
very
serious
threat
to
his
or
her
well-being,
which
might
require
the
pulling
of
a
baton
if
the
officer
has
a
baton
or
the
pulling
of
the
revolver
where
there's
a
threat
to
the
officer's
life,
but
it
may
escalate
very
quickly.
and
one
thing
that's
very
important
is
for
an
officer
to
take
control
of
a
situation
to
prevent
the
escalation.
we're
speaking
of
a
grappling
physical
encounter
between
two
individuals,
and
the
sooner
that
the
officer
has
control
of
the
other
person's
body
and
his
or
her
weapon,
for
example
the
revolver,
in
a
position
of
safety,
the
better.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
it
usually
does,
when
people
are
acting
rationally.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
well,
you
don't
have
to
choke
people
to
death.
and
i
think
that
we
do,
as
i
say,
take
issue
with
the
general
conclusion
that
all
of
these
deaths
have
been
caused
by
the
control
hold
system.
this
is
an
incredibly
complex
medical
phenomenon
that
does
require
further
study
and
will
be
studied.
the
process
of
review
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
is
not
an
episodic
thing.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
almost
always--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--yes,
that's
the
policy.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
yes,
but
there's
one
additional
predicate
i
would
add
here,
that
it's
only
where
the
officer
has
tried
lower
force
techniques
and
they
failed,
or
at
the
time
it
just
didn't
seem
reasonable
to
try
to
twist
the
arm
or
bend
the
wrist
to
cause
pain.
what
they
do
teach
the
officers
is
to
escalate
and
de-escalate
the
level
of
force
to
no
higher
level
than
necessary
to
control
somebody.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
when
it's
necessary
to
use
force,
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
policy.
and
it's
not
to
use
them
at
the
officer's
complete
discretion.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
respondent's...
respondent's
charge
here
is
that
when
he
had
his
encounter
with
the
officer
department
the
control
hold
was
put
on
for
no
reason
whatsoever,
that
he
did
nothing
to
prompt
it.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
exactly.
it's
a
violation
of
a
number
of
things.
and
if
the
case
ever
does
go
to
trial,
of
course
we
would
have
to
determine
if
that
actually
happened.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
there
are
two
cases
he's
bringing,
in
a
sense.
there's
the
primary
case
and
then
there's
the
hidden
case.
the
primary
case
is,
you
have
to
be
fearful
that
the
hold
would
be
applied
according
to
policy,
and
that's
his
monell
theory.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
that's
correct.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
yes.
and
the
other,
the
hidden
case
that
he
has
in
a
sense
is
that
the
control
hold
is
applied
without
provocation.
and
that
is
an
entirely
different
case,
and
whatever
the
probabilities
may
be
with
regard
to
the
policy,
they've
got
to
be,
hopefully,
incredibly
remote
with
regard
to
out
of
policy
application
of
the
control
holds.
so
we're
speaking
of,
once
again,
on
both
issues,
very
remote
possibilities
of
injury
to
the
individual.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
to
the
same
person.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
there
was
no
class
certification.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal,
please.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
the
one
you
stated,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
judgment
that
comes
from
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
a
preliminary
injunction,
but
there
are
decisions
of
this
court--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--no
other
judgments.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
only
judgment,
yes.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
and
that
is
stayed.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
that's
right.
it's
inherent
in
it,
and
this
court
has
ruled
in
the
past
that
decisions,...
the
term
"early
in
the
proceedings"
upon
which
this
court
has
a
rule,
can
be
raised
at
a
later
point.
it's
inherent
and
indeed,
the
court
could
raise
it
on
its
motion
if
it
so
desired
because
it's
a
case
of
controversey
under
article
iii
which
is
at
issue--
there
are
just
two
points
i
would
like
to
address
on
rebuttal.
the
first
is
to
clarify
a
point
relative
to
what
the
city
wants.
the
city
wants
flexibility.
it's
not
clear
that
the
city
ever
will
go
back
to
the
control
holds...
wants
the
flexibility
to
do
so
should
it
make
that
determination.
the
second
issue
goes
to
whether
the
respondent
believes
the
case
is
moot.
if
the
respondent
believes
that
the
need
for
a
declaration
or
injunctive
relief
is
moot,
respondent
would
move
to
dismiss
all
aspects
of
the
case
other
than
damages.
and
counsel
for
the
respondent
said,
apparently,
that
only
the
damages
issue
remains.
i
think
what
the
respondent
is
trying
to
do,
however,
is
to
have
the
spectra
of
federal
judicial
control
there
overseeing
the
police
department's
decisions
on
this
matter.
and
if
they're
not
satisfactory
to
the
respondent,
then
the
respondent
will
be
in
court
perhaps--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--well,
i--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--respondent
could
have
said
that,
yes.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
that's
right.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
filed
our
petition
in
december
of
1981.
the
moratorium
followed
roughly
six
months
thereafter.
and
debriefing
was
well
underway
at
the
time
on
may
12th,
that
the
police
commission
instituted
the
moratorium.
it
was
shortly
thereafter
that
respondent
moved
to
have
the
writ
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
that's
right.
and
i
believe
correctly
so.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
assumption.
for
example,--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
he's
saying
vacate...
he's
not
concerned
about
the
preliminary
injunction,
but
his
primary
causes
for
declaratory
injunctive
relief
i
think
he
still
wishes
to
pursue.
because
otherwise,
he
would
dismiss
all
injunctive,
all
equitable
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
well,
there
is
a
problem
that
the
city
faces
with
respect
to
the
doctrines
enunciated
by
the
ninth
circuit.
whatever
control
hold
policy
the
city
chooses
is
immediately
challengeable
in
district
court,
and
not
just
the
control
hold
policy;
any
use
of
force
policy.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
well,
that--
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
--i
don't
believe
it's
advisory.
mr.
frederick
n.
merkin
perhaps.
but
that's
basically
all
i
have.
thank
you.
