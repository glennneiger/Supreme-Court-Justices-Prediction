justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
merkin,
can
you
tell
us
at
least
who
will
probably
make
that
decision--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--about
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
inquired?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
merkin,
there
was
a
motion
in
this
case
to
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted
or
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
mootness,
and
as
i
read
the
respondent's
brief
they
assert
not
that
the
case
is
actually
moot
in
the
technical
sense,
because
of
course
i
guess
there's
an
action
for
damages
pending,
but
that
the
need
for
the
preliminary
injunction
has
disappeared
in
view
of
the
department's
change
of
policy,
and
therefore
that
we
should
simply
vacate
the
preliminary
injunction
and
presumably
let
the
case
proceed
in
the
district
court.
your
response
in
your
reply
brief
is
an
argument
that
the
case
isn't
moot
in
the
technical
sense.
but
i
didn't
understand
the
respondent
to
contend
that
it
was
moot
in
the
technical
sense.
i
thought
they
were
simply
saying
that
the
need
for
injunctive
relief
had
disappeared.
do
you
disagree?
i
take
it
you
disagree
with
that,
but
could
you
say
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
itself
more
or
less
a
confession
that
the
kamenish
doctrine
really
doesn't
apply
to
you
and
that
there
is
a
real
prospect
that
the
moratorium
could
shift,
and
if
it
does
you'll
be
back
in
district
court
right
away?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you'll
be
back
in
the
district
court
if
you
have
to
bet
but
you
think
the
chances
are
99
out
of
100
that
you
won't
have
to
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
in
fairness
to
respondent,
though,
the
moratorium
hadn't
taken
place
at
the
time
you
filed
your
petition,
had
it?
