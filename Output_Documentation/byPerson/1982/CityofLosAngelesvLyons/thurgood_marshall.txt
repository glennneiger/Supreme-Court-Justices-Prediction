justice
thurgood

would
it
be
all
right
if
the
rule
said
that
they
should
only
use
it
unless
the
application
of
such
force
is
necessary
to
prevent
serious
bodily
harm
to
the
opinion?
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
what
the
court
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
the
court
said,
didn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what's
wrong
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
said
it
was
all
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
recourse
does
a
man
have
whom
you
kill?
what
recourse
does
the
man
that
you
kill
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
constitution
speaks
of
"individual
rights",
"individual".
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
each
one
of
those
900
would
have
a
constitutional
right,
wouldn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
the
police
puts
his
arm
around
my
neck,
can
i
object
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
the
gun
sort
of
get
control?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
a
loaded
gun
usually
get
control?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
have
to
choke
him
to
death?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
a
traffic
violation,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
your
client
agree
with
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
your
client
agree
with
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
he
tell
you
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
his
position
right
now?
i
mean,
i'm
just
wondering
about
you
standing
up
there
giving
away
half
of
your
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
guess
it's
your
position
that
all
that's
gone
on
in
the
past
in
this
case
is
just
wasted
effort?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
what
else
you
can
say.
you've
gone
through
all
of
this
for
how
many
years?
how
many
years
has
this
case
been
pending?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
all
of
that's
just
going
to
be
washed
down
the
drain?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
you'll
start
again
after
the
moratorium's
lifted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
you
just
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
wasted
your
time
and
you've
wasted
other
people's
time
all
along.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
object
to
you
wasting
mine.
more
than
that,
if
i
understand
your
speech
about
the
fear
that
your
client
suffers
as
he
wanders
around
los
angeles,
that
you're
going
to
let
him
suffer
that
fear
during
the
period
between
the
lifting
of
the
moratorium
and
the
time
you
can
get
back
and
get
another
injunctions
which
may
well
take
a
couple
of
months.
justice
thurgood
marshall
respondent
could
have
said
that
when
you
filed
your
petition
for
certiorari.
and
we
wouldn't
be
here.
we
wouldn't
have
all
this
problem.
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
respondent
have
said
we
don't
care
about
the
injunction,
and
let
it
go.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wouldn't
be
up
here,
would
you?
