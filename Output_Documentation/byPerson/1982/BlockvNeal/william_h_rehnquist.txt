justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
phillips,
you
referred
two
or
three
times
to
the
claim
as
one
claiming
a
negligent
inspection.
actually,
the
claim
involved
a
breach
of
the
duty
to
supervise
as
well
as
to
inspect,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
complaint
never
went
to
trial,
and
under
the
federal
rules
you
presumably
are
entitled
to
adduce
any
number
of
facts
in
support
of
even
a
generally
pled
allegation.
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
referred
to
it.
it
says,
failure
to
provide
technical
assistance,
including
inspection
and
supervision
of
construction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
realize--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
you
say
that
even
the
1949
act
doesn't
authorize
or
require
the
government
to
supervise
as
opposed
to
inspect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
government
is
responsible
or
assumes
responsibility
for
anything
like
architectural
supervision,
that
certainly
is...
the
thrust
of
that
sort
of
a
liability,
if
they
fail
to
perform
it,
isn't
misrepresentation
at
all.
if
you
are
an
owner
and
hire
an
architect,
and
the
architect
defaults
on
his
obligation
to
supervise,
the
gist
of
your
claim
against
him
isn't
that
he
didn't
tell
you
that
a
lot
of
things
were
bad
in
the
place,
it
is
that
he
didn't
have
them
fixed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
croce,
are
you
reading
from
the
complaint
now,
or
summarizing
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
you
are
about
to
go
into
a
list
of
the
omissions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
those
contained
in
the
complaint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
time
of
year
did
she
move
in?
does
the
complaint
say?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
time
of
year
did
she
move
in?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
couldn't
she
figure
out
the
minute
she
moved
in
that
she
didn't
have
any
heat?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
croce,
do
you
think
either
the
sixth
circuit
or
the
district
court
in
this
case
passed
on
the
question
of
whether
her
allegations
apart
from
the
inspection
theory
stated
a
claim
against
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
read
in
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
any
specific
pronouncement
one
way
or
the
other
about
whether
if
you
prove
these
facts,
the
government
under
either
the
'34
act
or
the
'49
act
did
have
an
obligation
imposed
by
statute
to
perform
these
services.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
realize
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
part
of
your
complaint
is
not
only
that
there
was
a
duty
to
supervise
that
was
breached,
but
that
the
duty
of
supervision
was
undertaken
whether
required
by
law
or
not,
and
that
on
the
good
samaritan
theory
it
was
negligently
performed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
neustadt
began
swallowing
the
act,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
phillips,
as
i
understand
from
mr.
croce,
the
allegation...
one
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
is
that
the
government
undertook
to
supervise,
and
did
so
negligently.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
indicate
that
in
a
complaint
under
the
federal
rules.
you
can
produce
all
sorts
of
evidence
that
will
support
simply
conclusionary
allegations
in
a
complaint.
you
can't
try
the
case
in
a
complaint.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
they
say...
the
allegations
they
could
introduce
in
support
of
an
allegation
of
negligent
supervision
go
much
further,
i
would
think,
than
just
negligent
inspection.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
case
has
never
gone
to
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
an
allegation
of
negligent
supervision
in
the
complaint.
is
there
any
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
there
was
an
obligation
by
contract
or
by
statute
or
by
regulation
to
supervise?
