mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
suit
arising
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
and
specifically
the
issue
is
whether
a
suit
against
the
united
states
alleging
that
a
federal
employee
negligently
inspected
a
home
purchased
from
a
private
developer
but
with
federal
moneys
is
a
claim
arising
out
of
a
misrepresentation
and
therefore
barred
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
specifically,
section
2680(h)
of
the
act.
the
farmers
home
administration
is
an
agency
of
the
department
of
agriculture
which,
among
other
services,
provides
loans
to
low
income
rural
housing
residents
to
assist
them
in
purchasing
safe
and
decent
housing.
in
1977,
the
farmers
home
administration
granted
respondent's
application
for
a
loan,
and
respondent
then
entered
into
a
contract
with
a
private
developer...
the
name
of
the
company
is
home
marketing
associates,
inc....
to
purchase
a
prefabricated
house.
the
purchase
price
of
the
house
was
approximately
$21,000.
during
the
construction
of
the
house,
and
in
accordance
with
farmers
home
administration
regulations,
a
county
employee
of
the
administration
inspected
the
house
when
it
was
2
percent
completed,
99
percent
completed,
and
100
percent
completed.
on
each
occasion,
she
signed
an
inspection
report
indicating
that
there
were
no
major
deviations
from
the
housing
plan
and
specifications
that
she
discovered
in
her
inspection.
each
inspection
lasted
between
10
and
30
minutes.
ms.
wells
and
respondent
both
participated
in
the
final
inspection,
and
respondent
signed
the
final
inspection.
two
months
after
respondent
moved
into
her
house,
she
notified
the
farmers
home
administration
that
she
was
having
difficulties
with
the
heat
pump
that
had
been
installed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
sir,
it
was
not
the
best
inspection
that
one
could
have
hoped
for.
a
second
inspector
went
out
to
the
house
and
discovered
that
the
heat
pump
that
had
been
installed
was
not
the
same
heat
pump
that
had
been
provided
in
the
plans
and
specifications,
that
it
was
indeed
a
significantly
smaller
heat
pump
than
they
had
anticipated,
made
by
a
different
manufacturer.
in
addition,
that
inspector
discovered
other
defects
in
the
house
that
are
listed
in
the
respondent's
brief.
efforts
by
the
farmers
home
administration
to
convince
the
home
marketing
associates
company
to
correct
these
defects
proved
unsuccessful
for
reasons
that
do
not
appear
in
the
record.
when
respondent
failed
to
get
satisfaction
or
to
receive
satisfaction
from
the
company,
she
filed
suit
in
state
court
against
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
the
head
of
the
farmers
home
administration,
various
employees
of
the
farmers
home
administration,
and
the
united
states.
that
suit
was
removed
to
federal
court,
and
the
district
court
dismissed
the...
or,
excuse
me,
granted
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
the
theory
of
the
district
court
was
essentially
that
the
statute
and
regulations
created
no
basis...
created
no
duty
running
to
the
respondent
to
guarantee
the
quality
of
the
house
based
on
the
inspections
that
had
been
undertaken.
the
sixth
circuit
on
appeal
agreed
with
the
district
court
with
regard
to
the
contract
theory.
it
found
nothing
in
the
statute,
regulations,
or
conduct
of
the
farmers
home
administration
that
would
create
any
kind
of
a
contractual
duty
to
warrant
the
quality
of
the
house.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
reversed
under
the...
on
the
tort
issue,
and
held
that
the
government's
inspection
could
legitimately
be
regarded
or
could
potentially,
at
least,
be
regarded
as
having
violated
the
good
samaritan
doctrine.
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
requires
someone
who
acts
on
behalf
of
another
and
engenders
reliance
from
that
other
person
to
exercise
due
care
and
to
be
responsible
for
any
injuries
caused
by
the
failure
to
exercise
due
care.
in
addition,
the
court
held
that
the
respondent's
claim
regarding
negligent
inspection
was
not
barred
by
the
misrepresentation
exception.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
there
is
nothing
specific
in
the
complaint
with
regard
to
exactly
what
they
meant
by
supervision.
the
only
supervision
of
the
construction,
justice
rehnquist,
was
in
the
inspection
of
the
house.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that
is
only
if
there
is
something
in
the
statute
that
would
provide
for
supervision
in
addition
to
the
inspection--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
to
that
effect,
so
that
at
issue...
the
only
thing
that
could
potentially
be
alleged
and
be
consistent
with
the
statute
is
the
negligent
inspection.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
mean,
the
only
supervision
that
is
discussed
is
supervised
loans
and
the
provision
of
information
to
the
respondent,
so
that
even
to
the
extent
that
supervision
is
alleged
here,
it
is
all...
it
is
still
all
based
on
the
exchange
of
information,
and
that
exchange
of
information
is
what
this
court
held
in
neustadt
as
barred
under
the
misrepresentation
exception.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
as
required
by
the
secretary.
nothing
that
we
have
specifically
requires
us
to
do
more
supervision
of
the
construction.
we
do
supervise
to
the
extent
that
we
provide
plans
and
general
architectural
information
to
contractors
that
we
hope...
that
we
expect
that
they
will
follow,
and
we
follow
that
up
by
inspecting
the
house
to
try
to
see
that
there
is
some
conformity
between
the
plans
and
the
way
the
house
is
developed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
in
the
way
that
would
be
anything
other
than
by...
that
would
be
covered...
not
in
any
way
that
is
not
covered
under
the
misrepresentation
exception
to
the
tort
claims
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure,
because
that
doesn't...
that
still
is
supervision
of
the
borrowers.
it
is
not...
we
don't
supervise
construction.
it
is
not
as
though
the
government
assumes
a
position
of
foreman
for
home
marketing
associates.
we
go
out
and
we
inspect
it.
that
is
the
primary
method
by
which
we
supervise.
there
is
additional
supervision
in
that
we
supervise
the
loan
to
make
sure
that
the
moneys
are
spent
properly,
and
there
is
additional
information,
and
the
provision
of
architectural
services
is
a
form
of
supervision.
but
all
of
that,
i
submit,
is
supervision
that
would
be
barred
under
the
misrepresentation
exception
if
there
is
a
basis
for
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
that
is
what
the
district
court
held,
and
the
court
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--we
did
not
argue
that
in
this...
it
would
be
my
position,
that
we
owe
no
specific
duty
to
this...
to
the
respondent
in
this
case.
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
under
the
law.
that
while
we
do...
i
mean,
there
is
no...
the
regulations
provide
general
obligations
to
act,
but
the
only
duty
that
would
ever
occur
would
have
to
come
out
of
state
law,
and
that,
we
say,
is...
and
to
the
extent
a
duty
would
have
existed--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
no--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
i...
no,
that
is
not
our
submission.
we
recognize,
just
as
in
neustadt,
that
this
statute
is
designed
to
provide
some
benefits.
i
mean,
almost
all
federal
statutes
are
designed
to
benefit
individual
citizens.
this
is
one
of
them.
the
primary
purpose
of
this
statute,
we
have
submitted,
is
to
protect
the
government's
security
interest.
in
doing
that,
we
will
in
most
instances
also
protect
the
homeowner,
but
that
is
only
incidental
to
what
i
submit
is
our
primary
mission,
at
least
as
interpreted
by
the
farmers
home
administration,
which
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no
secondary
duty
that
would
give
rise
to
any
kind
of
tort
liability.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
difference
between
misrepresentation
and
various
forms
of
malpractice.
but
all
we
are
saying
here,
i
mean,
we
didn't
hire
an
architect
of
any
sort.
what
we
did
was,
we
had
an
architect
draw
up
plans
that
would
be
usable
for
all
rural
residents,
and
we
have
a
variety
of
those
plans
that
exist,
and
we
just
hoped
that
they
would
be
followed.
that's
all.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that
is
correct,
except
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
neustadt,
the
way
the
analysis
should
run
is,
first,
whether
the
basic
activities
of
the
government
are
within
the
misrepresentation
exception
which
we
submit
means
an
inspection
which
may
be
negligently
performed
followed
by
certification
of
some
facts
followed
by
injury.
that
is
what
the
misrepresentation
exception
is
designed
to
deal
with.
this
court
went
further
and
said
it
could
well
be
that
even
though
this
is
within
the
misrepresentation
exception,
there
could
be
some...
there
may
have
been
indication
in
the
'34
act
at
issue
there
that
for
some
reason
congress
intended
to
supersede
the
misrepresentation
exception,
and
respondents
have
seized
on
differences
between
the
'34
act
and
the
'49
act
to
suggest
that
that
secondary
analysis
in
neustadt
is
satisfied
in
this
case.
our
position
is
that
there
is
nothing
different
in
the
'49
act
and
the
'34
act.
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
for
the
government
to
warrant
the
quality
of
the
respondent's
house
in
this
case.
as
we
have...
i
may
be
going
over
some
ground,
but
section
1346
obviously
provides
a
general
waiver
for...
of
the
government's
sovereign
immunity.
the
exception
that
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
for
misrepresentations.
our
submission
is
that
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
versus
neustadt.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
mean,
within
the
meaning
of
section
2680(a)?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
would
guess...
i
mean,
it
seems
fairly
clear...
it
depends
on
how
the
regulation
would
be
stated,
i
guess.
if
there
were
a
regulation
in
this
case
that
said
that
the
government
must
discover
every
defect
and
must
make
every
defect
corrected
before
any
moneys
will
be
released,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
we
would
be
hard
pressed
to
argue
that
that
is
a
discretionary
decision,
because
the
regulation
will
have
essentially
taken
away
all
of
our
discretion.
but
if
the
regulation
merely
suggests
that
we
should
have
inspections,
and
there
is
some
general
possibility
that
we
might
withhold
money
depending
on
the
circumstances,
then
it
would
seem
clearly
to
be
within
the
discretionary
function
exception.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
it
is
clear...
it
would
clearly
be
discretionary.
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations...
i
mean,
i
think
it
is
important
to
realize
in
this
case
that
the
respondent
has
received
reimbursement
for
the
heat
pump
and
other
major
structural
defects
in
this
house
under
an
administrative
program,
and
the
only
defects
we
are
talking
about
now
are
essentially
cosmetic
defects.
it
is
inconceivable,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations
that
would
provide
to
the
contrary,
that
congress
anticipated
that
we
would
hold
up
all
loan
moneys
for
the
correction
of
all
potential
cosmetic
defects
in
a
house.
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief,
and
i
don't
believe
respondents
deny
it,
there
is
no
new
house
that
i
have
ever
known
and
that
anyone
has
known
and
that
the
contractor
even
in
this
case
in
his
testimony
had
ever
seen
that
doesn't
have
some
problems
in
it.
and
it
can't
be
that
the
government
will
be
responsible
to
correct
all
of
those.
and
that
is
why
there
is
nothing
in
the
regs.
so,
clearly,
there
is
some
discretion.
you
would
release
money
and
expect
that
the
contractor
would
make
good
on
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
there
were...
if
this
were
a
private
person
who
undertook...
we
don't...
although
there
is
no
development
factually
of
what
went
on
here,
we
don't
deny
that
it
is
certainly
possible
that
a
private
inspector
could
be
held
to
a
duty
to
exercise
due
care
under
the
good
samaritan
doctrine.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that's
right,
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
but
i
mean,
that
is
just
as
true
under
united
states
versus
neustadt.
in
that
case--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--you
just
want
to
ignore
the
misrepresentation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
would
be
prepared
to
concede
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
that
is
right.
there
would
be
a
duty,
and
that
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
duty.
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
the
court
at
least
here
now
with
the
sixth
circuit's
holding
that
this
might
well
violate
the
good
samaritan
doctrine.
our
submission
is
obviously
that
it
is
also
a
misrepresentation,
and
therefore--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
has
a
very
lengthy
set
of
exceptions.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
section
2680(h).
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
we
don't
rely
on
the
discretionary
functions.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
your
honor.
our
position
here
is
that
there
is
no...
that
this
court
cannot
affirm
the
holding
of
the
sixth
circuit
without
overruling
its
prior
decision
in
united
states
versus
neustadt,
and
that
it
would
be
wholly
inappropriate
to
do
that.
neustadt
involved
simply
an
interpretation
of
section
2680(h),
a
provision
that
congress
enacted
in
1946
and
has
allowed
to
remain
in
effect
since
1961,
when
this
court
decided
neustadt.
if
its
feeling
was
that
the
interpretation
of
this
court
was
improper
or
unduly
restricted
the
rights
of
recovery
of
individuals
in
respondent's
position,
we
can
only
presume
that
it
would
have
changed
it.
instead,
what
congress
has
done
is,
one,
passed
additional
legislation
providing
for
inspections
relying
upon
this
court's
decision
in
neustadt,
and
more
fundamentally,
has
passed
42
usc
section
1797(c),
and
this
case--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no
difference
that
would
make
any
kind
of
a
difference
to
take
the
case
out
of
the
misrepresentation
exception.
i
don't
believe
that
anything
in
the
1949
act
provides
any
stronger
basis
for
arguing
that
the
government
has
warranted
the
quality
of
the
house,
and
that
is
the
only
thing
that
i
can
understand
the
court
to
have
meant
in
the
second
part
of
its
holding
in
neustadt,
because
otherwise...
i
mean,
it
is
within
the
misrepresentation
exception,
but
it
may
be
that
the
government
went
ahead
and
warrants
the
house,
but
the
'49
act
makes
clear
that
that
was
not
the
intention,
and
no
other
court
has
ever
held
that
it
was
the
intention.
you
know,
no
court
in
reviewing
the
legislative
history
has
indicated
that
congress
intended
to
warrant
the
quality
of
all
of
these
houses.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
is
some
dispute
about
that.
nothing
in
the
record
indicates
precisely
when
the
check
was
delivered
to
the
respondent
in
this
case.
the
employees
of
the
farmers
home
administration
have
informed
us
that
while
the
check
was
formally
dispersed
from
the
farmers
home
administration's
central
office
on
the
date
listed
in
the
record
in
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
in
the
record.
to
the
extent
you
are
interested
in
the
extra
record
facts,
a
check
was
handed
over--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--okay,
your
honor.
what
we
can
say,
i
think,
is
that
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
farmers
home
administration
would
hand
over
a
check
without
having
made
its
final
inspection,
and
therefore
we
believe
it
is
a
fair
inference
from
all
of
the
circumstances
to
conclude
that
we
didn't
actually
send
the
check
away
until
after
we
had
engaged
in
the
final
inspection.
at
least
that
is
the
standard
practice,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
it
was
deviated
from
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
regulations
don't
actually
require
us...
i
don't...
my
recollection
is
that
the
regulations
suggest
that
we
make
inspections
at
various
times.
i
would
guess
that
if
it
turned
out
that
the
farmers
home
administration
had
good
reason
that
it
couldn't...
simply
was
not
in
a
position
to
inspect
a
house
at
the
times
that
it
had
to,
that
that
would
not
violate
the
regulations.
the
most
we
would
do
is
tell
her
that
we
are
having
some
difficulty,
but
i
don't
see
that
that
would
create
any
cause
of
action.
again,
all
this...
all
tort
liability--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
she
looked
through
the
house.
i
don't
know
what...
i
mean,
presumably
any
kind
of
obvious
defects
in
the
house
could
have
been
discovered,
even
on
the...
even
with
that
kind
of
an
inspection.
it
is
not
likely
she
would
have
been
able
to
discover
whether
the
proper
manufacturer's
name
appeared
on
the
heat
pump
based
on
the
kind
of
inspection
we
are
talking
about
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but,
see,
there
is
an
inherent
advantage,
if
somebody
has
been
living
in
the
house
for
two
months,
and
has
started
to
use
the
house
and
the
dwelling.
you
find
out
things
as
you
go
along.
it
is
simply
not
reasonable
to
expect
the
government...
even
if
we
had
the
best
inspectors
in
the
world
and
took
time,
it
is
most
unlikely
we
would
discover
every
conceivable
defect
in
a
house
prior
to
the
moving
in
of
the...
or
prior
to
the
final
settlement
of
the
house.
the
court
in...
this
court
in
united
states
versus
neustadt
made
plain
what
i
think
is
the
proper
approach
in
these
cases.
the
question
is...
it
recognized
that
the
traditional
common
law
rule
of
misrepresentation
recognized
tort
in
the
situation
where
there
is
an
inspection
followed
by
certification
of
a
fact
followed
by
injury
in
reliance
on
that
fact.
and
that
is
precisely
what
is
involved
in
this
case,
and
a
misrepresentation
exception
should
be
applied
in
this
case,
just
as
it
was
in
neustadt.
i
think
it
is
important
to
realize
that
this
is
not
an
overreaching
use
of
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine.
respondent
has
received
recovery.
the
congress
provided
for
her
under
an
administrative
relief
program
that
was
adopted
in
clear
recognition
that
she
would
not
have
recovery
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
neustadt,
and
unless...
and
in
order
to
hold
as
the
sixth
circuit
did,
it
would
have
to
be
in
absolute
disregard
of
that
enactment.
we
submit
that
is
incorrect,
and
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
that
judgment.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
briefly.
the
respondent's
submission
goes...
details
a
long
series
of
problems
with
this
house,
and
we
don't
deny
that
there
are
problems
with
her
house,
but
what
that
submission
does
not
indicate
is
what
was
the
role
of
the
government
and
what
was
its
responsibility
under
this
act,
and
at
bottom
the
responsibility
of
the
government
remains
to
inspect
the
house.
the
responsibility
for
the
defects
in
the
house
must
remain
in
the
first
instance
on
the
private
contractor.
that
is
the
person
who
builds
the
house,
who
supervises
its
construction
and
its
placement
into
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--all
that
the
complaint
says
is
that
the
government
negligently
supervised.
it
doesn't
in
any
way
indicate
anything
other
than
through
the
inspection
process
how
that
supervision
could
take
place.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
appreciate
that,
justice
rehnquist,
but
if
the
only
supervision
provided
for
in
the
regulations
and
provided
for
in
any
of
the
factual
statements
is
the
inspection
of
that
house,
then
to
say
that
there
has
been
negligent
supervision
is
to
say
no
more
than
that
there
was
a
negligent
inspection
of
the
house,
and
that
is
all
the
complaint
states.
it
doesn't
say
that
we
did
anything
in
any
way
other
than
our
inspection
of
the
house.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
they
couldn't...
i
mean,
unless
you
are
going
to
assume
that
there
is
something
outside
of
the
regulations,
and
there
is
no
indication
that
anyone
acted
in
addition
to
what
the
regulations
provide.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
understand
that,
but
there
has
never
been
any
claim
anywhere
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
there
to
that
effect
and
the
district
court
expressly
found
that
there
is
no
such
obligation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thats
correct
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--only
to
the
extent
that
the
only
way
the
supervision
is
performed
is
through
the
inspection
process.
as
i
said
earlier--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--we
don't
serve
as
the
foreman
for
the
construction
company.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
i
appreciate
what
the
statute
says.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
under
the
regulations--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--our
regulations
say
that
we
will
inspect,
and
that
is
done
as
our
burden
of
supervision.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
am
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
the
extent
necessary
to
help
the
borrower,
which
in
this
case
means
to
undertake
an
inspection.
that
is
the
way
i
read
them
and
understand
the
way
the
regulations
work.
respondent
at
the
end
of
his
remarks
mentioned
the
administrative
remedy
one
last
time
and
suggested
that
it
is
not
intended
as
an
exclusive
remedy.
recognize
that
this
case
turns
exclusively
on
what
congress
has
intended,
and
congress
has
made
clear
what
its
understanding
and
intent
under
the
rural
home
loan
program
would
be,
that
is,
that
the
program
is
designed
to
look
just
like
the
situation
under
the
1934
act
that
was
at
issue
in
neustadt,
and
it
was
because
of
neustadt
that
congress
first
enacted
administrative
relief
for
the
fha,
extended
it
to
the
va,
and
extended
it
to
this
statute.
it
was
congress's
understanding
that
that
is
what
the
1949
act
would
lead
to
in
terms
of
claims
such
as
respondent's
in
this
case,
and
since
it
is
this
court's
interpretation
of
congress's
intent
that
controls,
and
the
sixth
circuit
has
disregarded
that
intent
completely,
we
ask
that
its
judgment
be
reversed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
mean
in
her
cause
of
action
for--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
ma'am.
i
believe
that
is
the
one
that
is--
