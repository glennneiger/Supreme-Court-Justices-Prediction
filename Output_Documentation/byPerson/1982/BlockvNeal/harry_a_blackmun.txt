wasn't
much

you
find
no
difference
in
the
two
acts,
the
one
involved--
justice
harry

suppose
the
inspection
had
not
been
made
at
all.
what
would
be
your
position?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
essentially
this
case,
isn't
it?

that
is
essentially
this
case.
it
is
true
she
went
out,
but
her
testimony
on
the
stand
is
rather
devastating.
she
wasn't
trained.
she
didn't
know
what
to
do
on
an
inspection,
and
didn't
inspect,
and
filled
out
the
papers.

someone
else
went
out
later
and
discovered
all
kinds
of
things.
