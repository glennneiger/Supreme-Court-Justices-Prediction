justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips,
doesn't
it...
excuse
me.
well,
following
up
on
this
point,
then,
if
i
may,
what
does
section
1476(a)
mean,
then,
when
it
says,
"buildings
and
repairs
constructed
with
funds
advanced
pursuant
to
this
subchapter
shall
be
supervised
and
inspected
as
required
by
the
secretary?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
mr.
phillips,
mr.
phillips,
you
are
not
suggesting
there
is
discretion
to
make
a
negligent
inspection,
are
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
there
were
a
duty
to
inspect.
i
understand
you
deny
there
is
such
duty
running
to
the
borrower,
but
assuming
there
were
a
duty
to
inspect,
would
it
not
be
a
duty
to
inspect
with
due
care?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
and
if
we
accept
the
allegations...
if
we
accept
the
allegation
in
the
complaint,
must
we
not
assume...
maybe
it's
not
true...
that
the
inspection
was
conducted
negligently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
had
the
inspection
been
conducted
properly,
they
would
have
discovered
the
defect
and
they
wouldn't
have
paid
for
the
heat
pump.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that
goes
to
the
issue
of
misrepresentation.
we
are
now
talking
about--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--for
this
very
narrow
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
again,
you
are
not
relying
on
that
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
just
relying
on
the
misrepresentation
exception.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
mr.
phillips
but
is
it
not
true
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
an
obligation
to
supervise
and
the
authority
to
supervise?
and
is
it
not
true
that
the
statute
authorized
the
government
to
supervise?
it
authorized
the
secretary
to
provide
for
supervision.
right.
the
statute
specifically
says
in
addition
to
the
financial
association,
this
is
in
section
506--
--the
secretary
is
authorized
to
furnish
various
things
including
construction
supervision.
and
then
the
regulations
say--
--supervision
will
be
provided
borrowers
to
the
extent
necessary
to
achieve
the
objective
of
the
loan.
doesn't
that
in
words
authorize
the
supervision...
period?
authorize
even
if
it
isn't
required.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
if
it
is
performed,
then
doesn't
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
come
in
to
play?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
statute
says--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
statute
says,
authorized
to
provide
construction
supervision
and
inspection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
have
authority
to
supervise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
regulations
say
you
will
supervise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
regulations
say
you
will
supervise.
