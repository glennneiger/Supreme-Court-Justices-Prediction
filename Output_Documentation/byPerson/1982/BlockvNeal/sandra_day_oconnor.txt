and
it
is
your
position
that
the
secretary
has
never
authorized
any
supervision
of
construction?

and
section
1822.7,
which
says,
"supervision
will
be
provided
borrowers
to
the
extent
necessary
to
achieve
the
objectives
of
the
loan
and
to
protect
the

"
justice

are
you
arguing
that
the
government
has
under
the
laws
established
here
no
duty
to
the
owner
of
the
home,
that
the
law
creates
no
duty
in
this
area?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
the
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
the
federal
law?
do
you
think
that
the
federal
law
indicates
that
there
is
no
intention
by
congress
to
benefit
the
homeowner--

--by
these
services?
justice
sandra

o'connor
and
there
is
no
secondary
duty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
phillips,
let's
assume
for
a
minute
that
the
complaint
did
allege
something
beyond
misrepresentation,
alleged
that
there
was
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
agency
to
force
the
builder
to
fix
the
home
by
some
means,
and
the
complaint
alleges
that.
now,
is
that
obligation
of
the
government
in
your
position
a
discretionary
act
by
the
government?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
government
has
discretion?
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then,
what
is
it...
what
do
they
require?
is
it
discretionary
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
croce,
under
your
theory,
do
you
suppose
that
when
the
federal
government
through
its
agencies
inspects
a
toy
or
a
drug,
for
example,
to
determine
whether
the
product
is
safe,
and
then
declares
it
safe,
that
someone
later
injured
because
in
fact
it
is
unsafe
has
a
cause
of
action
under
your
theory
against
the
government?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
just
one
additional
question.
did
the
parties
in
the
proceedings
below
have
any
occasion
to
discuss
the
application
of
section
2680(a)
of
the
tort
claims
act,
that
possible
exclusion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
phillips,
what
is
the
specific
provision
in
the
agreement
on
which
the
claimant
relied
for
the
duty
undertaken
by
the
government?
is
it
the
inspection
of
work
section
in
the
construction
contract,
exhibit
b
to
the
complaint?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
is
that
the
section?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
