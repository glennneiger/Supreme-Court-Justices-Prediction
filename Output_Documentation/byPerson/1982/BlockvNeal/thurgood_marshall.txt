this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
it
raises
a
particular
issue
concerning
the
scope
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
respondent
received
the
loan
from
the
farmers
home
administration
for
the
construction
of
a
prefabricated
house.
the
--
that
agency
is
authorized
to
provide
technical
assistance
to
those
who
receive
its
housing
loans.
according
to
respondent's
complaint,
the
company
that
built
her
home
failed
to
comply
with
plans
that
have
been
submitted
to
and
approved
by
the
officials
of
the
farmers
home
administration
in
roane
county,
tennessee.
although
the
officials
inspected
the
house
during
and
at
the
completion
of
construction,
respondent
claims
that
they
did
not
take
adequate
steps
to
ensure
that
the
builder
carryout
construction
in
a
proper
manner.
as
a
result,
the
defects
in
the
house
were
not
identified
until
months
after
final
payment
was
made
and
respondent
setup
residence.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
respondent's
complaint
stated
a
claim
that
government
officials
were
negligent
in
supervising
the
construction
of
her
house
and
held
that
this
negligent
action
could
be
brought
against
the
government
under
the
tort
claims
act.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
respondent's
action
is
excluded
from
the
act's
coverage
in
28
u.s.c.
which
excludes
any
claim
arising
out
of
misrepresentation.
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
respondent's
claim
is
not
barred
by
this
revision
of
the
tort
claims
act
because
she
does
not
seek
to
recover
on
the
basis
of
misstatements
made
by
the
governmental
officials.
we
agree.
although
the
farmers
home
administration
may
have
undertaken
both
to
supervise
construction
of
respondent's
house
and
to
give
her
information
regarding
the
progress
of
construction,
her
claim
is
based
solely
on
the
form
of
conduct.
the
essence
of
an
action
for
misrepresentation
is
a
communication
of
misinformation
on
which
the
recipient
relies.
here,
the
duty
of
government
officials
to
use
due
care
to
ensure
that
the
builder
adhered
to
the
approved
plan
and
cured
all
defects
before
completing
construction
were
distinct
from
any
duty
to
use
due
care
in
communicating
information
to
the
respondent.
and
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
the
chief
justice
concurs
in
the
judgment.
