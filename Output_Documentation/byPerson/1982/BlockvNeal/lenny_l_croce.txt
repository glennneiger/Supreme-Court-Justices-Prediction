mr.
lenny
l.
croce
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
despite
the
government's
attempt
to
torture
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
in
this
case
to
fit
the
misrepresentation
exception
to
the
tort
claims
act,
this
case
was
not,
is
not,
and
cannot
be
a
case
that
arises
out
of
misrepresentation.
first,
i
will
state
the
bases
of
ms.
neal's
claim,
and
then
secondly,
i
will
show
that
the
relationship
and
conduct
of
the
parties
created
a
duty
of
care
running
from
farmers
home
to
ms.
neal.
ms.
neal
asserts
in
her
complaint
that
farmers
home
employees
negligently
planned
and
supervised
the
construction
of
her
home.
this
claim
included
the
following
omissions
and
commissions.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
i
am
not
reading
from
the
complaint.
the
complaint
alleged
negligent
planning
and
supervision
of
her
home,
and
that
they
breached
a
duty
of
care
to
her
in
exercising
those
activities.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
yes.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
those
are
contained
in
the
factual
allegations
of
the
complaint,
which
preceded
the
cause
of
action,
the
statement
of
a
cause
of
action.
first,
that
farmers
home
failed
to
recommend
and
approve
a
reputable
and
competent
builder.
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
builder
was
disbarred
subsequently,
and
the
depositions
had
attached
a
letter
which
showed
that
builder
had
nine
other
complaints
against
it,
not
just
ms.
neal.
secondly,
that
the
officials
failed
to
obtain
accurate
and
complete
plans
for
ms.
neal's
home.
in
the
complaint
we
allege
they
received
a
totally
different
set
of
plans
that
what
they
were
supposed
to
be
for
ms.
neal,
and
that
those
plans
didn't
have
any
plans
for
the
heating
and
cooling
duct
system.
third,
that
the
farmers
home
did
not
properly
review
the
plans
and
specifications
of
ms.
neal's
home.
ms.
wells
admitted
she
didn't
look
at
the
plans.
fourth,
that
the
farmers
home
did
not
properly
supervise
the
expenditure
of
ms.
neal's
loan
proceeds.
there
was
money
paid
out
before
the
first
inspection
was
made.
farmers
home
failed
to
detect
defects
in
ms.
neal's
home.
that
is
quite
evident.
they
failed
to
reject
defective
working
materials
or
to
require
their
correction.
finally,
they
failed
to
carefully
inspect
her
home.
out
of
this
extensive
negligent
conduct,
which
lasted
over
a
period
of
months
and
involved
several
farmers
home
employees,
the
government
extracts
out
one
single
inspection
report
and
seeks
to
rely
upon
it
to
deny
ms.
neal
her
day
in
court.
an
examination
of
the
facts
alleged
in
the
claim
and
gleaned
from
the
record
here
shows
that
the
graveman
of
ms.
neal's
complaint
is
negligence,
not
misrepresentation.
we
must
review
the
conduct
in
relationship
in
the
transaction
between
the
parties.
when
we
do,
that
shows
that
a
duty...
that
farmers
home
undertook
activities
which
they
had
a
duty
to
perform
with
due
care.
in
1976,
ms.
neal
was
a
48-year-old
cafeteria
worker
in
a
local
elementary
school.
the
home
she
was
living
in
was
falling
down
around
her,
literally.
she
didn't
make
much
money,
a
little
over
$3,000
a
year.
when
she
couldn't
find
housing
she
could
afford
herself,
she
went
to
the
lender
of
last
resort,
her
local
farmers
home
administration
office.
ms.
neal
filled
out
an
application.
she
was
certified
eligible.
ms.
neal
was
referred
by
the
county
supervisor
to
a
local
builder
of
prefabricated
homes.
they
reviewed
plans
which
purported
to
be
for
her
home.
they
supplied
a
form
construction
contract
which
had
a
special
clause
in
it
which
gave
farmers
home
the
right
to
inspect,
test,
and
examine
materials,
and
to
reject
defective
materials
and
require
correction.
before
construction
began,
she
executed
a
promissory
note
to
pay
back
the
loan.
she
executed
a
deed
of
trust
to
secure
the
note.
and
then
the
proceeds
were
put
in
a
supervised
account
which
required
not
only
her
signature
but
an
official
from
farmers
home's
signature
to
release
the
funds.
three
dispersements
were
made.
the
last
one
that
we
know
of
was
made
on
september
30th,
and
then
they
made
three
on-site
inspections,
the
last
one
occurring
on
october
3rd.
now,
after
she
moved
into
the
house,
she
discovered
things
weren't
right.
she
didn't
have
any
heat.
the
ducts
were
falling
apart.
the
plumbing
had
90-degree
bends
in
it.
she
couldn't
find
her
water
heater.
the
concrete
block
foundation
had
blocks
missing.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
what
time
did
she
move?
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
she
moved
in
some
time
in
october,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
your
honor,
that
was
not
in
the
record,
and
i
can
answer
your
question.
whenever
the
confusion
came
up,
when
the
exact
payment
was
made,
i
said,
we
never
did
find
out
when
you
moved
in,
ms.
neal.
i
called
her
up.
she
said,
well,
i
had
to
move
in
october
1st
because
the
owner
of
the
house
i
was
in
was
tearing
it
down
and
said
i
had
to
be
out
before
october
1st--
the
house
presently
is
not
even
now
fastened
to
the
foundation,
and
there
is
no
exterior
sheathing
which
provides
any
moisture
barrier,
which
subjects
the
house
to
weather
conditions.
to
say
that
these
activities
undertaken
by
farmers
home
engendered
no
reliance
and
created
no
duty
of
care
simply
defies
common
sense.
she
couldn't
find
housing.
she
couldn't
afford
it.
she
didn't
have
much
education.
she
went
to
farmers
home
for
a
house.
they
took
her
application.
they
checked
her
credit.
they
determined
what
amount
she
could
pay
back.
they
determined
how
much
of
a
house
she
could
get.
they
set
the
minimum
standards.
they
set
the
maximum
payments.
they
engendered
total
reliance
upon
them
to
supply
the
means,
the
know-how,
the
supervision
and
inspections
needed
to
provide
ms.
neal
safe
and
decent
housing.
this
relationship
between
farmers
home
and
onilea
neal
and
the
extent
of
the
supervision
and
control
of
the
exercise
necessarily
engendered
reliance
by
ms.
neal
upon
farmers
home.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
first,
i
want
to
make
one
thing
clear,
justice
o'connor.
this
is
not
an
inspection
case.
it
is
a
negligence
case.
and
in
order
to
establish
a
claim
for
negligence,
you
must
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
duty
of
care
running
from
the
government
to
the
injured
party.
that
depends
upon
the
relationship
of
the
parties,
the
conduct
and
control
exercised
by
the
government
to
prevent
the
injury,
and
the
foreseeability
of
it.
it
is
certainly
foreseeable
in
the
fact
situation
you
gave
that
a
purchaser
of
a
defective
toy
would
be
harmed,
and
if
the
government
had
control
over
that
process,
it
may
very
well.
i
think
the
weakness
in
that
case
is
the
first
criteria,
and
that
is
the
relationship.
in
this
case,
farmers
home
and
ms.
neal
had
a
direct
one-to-one
relationship
which
was
clearly
dependent.
the
question
becomes
whether
or
not
that
particular
factor
in
the
fact
situation
you
suggest
is
strong
enough
to
impose
a
duty.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
no,
your
honor,
but
the
actions
by
the
farmers
home
administration
and
the
extensiveness
of
it
barred
her
or
precluded
her
from
seeking
outside
help.
she
assumed
that
farmers
home
was
going
to
take
care
of
everything.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
i
think
it
prevented
her.
i
mean--
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
--because
they
gave
her,
by
their
conduct--
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
--and
activities,
that
she
was--
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
--yes.
yes,
assuming
she
had
the
money,
but--
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
--i
don't
say
that.
i
think
her
responsibility
would
be
conditioned
upon
what
farmers
home
undertook
or
didn't
undertake.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
in
that
they
undertook
what
they
did,
she
necessarily
relied
upon
them
to
exercise
due
care.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
that's
correct.
this
case
does
not
violate
or
conflict
with
any
of
the
holdings
in
neustadt
or
indian
towing.
in
indian
towing...
this
case
is
like
indian
towing,
because
a
duty
of
care
was
running
from...
ran
from
farmers
home
to
onilea
neal,
and
that
duty
of
care
arises
out
of
farmers
home
undertaking
of
services.
if
a
private
party
had
undertaken
to
provide
ms.
neal
the
services
which
farmers
home
undertook,
and
engendered
the
kind
of
reliance
which
farmers
home
engendered,
that
person
would
be
obligated
to
use
due
care.
if
that
party
failed
in
its
duty
of
care
and
damages
resulted,
liability
would
be
found.
unlike
neustadt,
the
inspection
report
relied
upon
by
the
government
is
not
an
essential
element
to
sustain
ms.
neal's
cause
of
action.
you
could
take
away...
you
could
take
away
this
inspection
report
and
delete
it
from
the
record,
and
ms.
neal
would
still
have
a
cause
of
action.
if
you
took
away
the
appraisal
report
in
the
neustadt
case,
mr.
neustadt
simply
does
not
have
a
cause
of
action.
in
conclusion,
and
i
am
going
to
be
brief
here,
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
three
considerations.
first,
ms.
neal
is
not
asking
this
court
to
hold
farmers
home
liable.
what
she
is
asking
is
that
she
have
an
opportunity
to
prove
her
claim
in
court.
given
a
colorable
claim
of
negligence,
which
she
has
clearly
demonstrated,
she
should
be
entitled
to
pursue
her
claim
before
a
trier
of
fact.
if
she
had
been
given
this
opportunity--
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
--yes,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
saw
that
we
were
talking
more
than
just
merely
an
inspection
report.
we
were
talking
about
all
the
activities
that
farmers
home
undertook.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
it
is
our
contention
that
the
statute,
506,
and
the
regulations
under
that
statute
clearly
impose
upon
farmers
home
an
obligation
to
supervise
and
inspect.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
i
don't
think
that
is
really
material,
because
whether
or
not
farmers
home
performed
those
services
under
its
statutory
obligation
or
regulatory
obligation
or
voluntarily
undertook
them,
the
fact
is
that
they
did.
the
crucial--
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
--that's
correct.
the
crucial
thing
for
the
negligence
claim
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
duty
of
care,
and
the
duty
of
care
only
arises
under
principles
of
common
law,
and
in
this
case
the
principle
of
common
law
applied
is
the
voluntary
undertaking
doctrine.
if
ms.
neal
had
been
given
her
opportunity
to
present
her
claim
before
a
trier
of
fact,
this
court
and
the
parties
could
have
avoided
some
of
the
confusion
which
has
arisen
regarding
some
of
the
facts.
this
confusion
in
this
statement
is
probably
inevitable
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
trial,
finding
of
fact,
or
record,
complete
record
produced.
we
feel
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
issue
an
opinion
which
may
have
important
consequences
to
tort
law
and
federal
housing
policy
on
the
basis
of
an
incomplete
record.
secondly,
the
government's
assertion
that
ms.
neal's
claim
is
really
a
misrepresentation
is
a
red
herring.
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
which
are
contained
in
the
record
cannot
support
the
government's
contentions.
if
the
farmers
home
interpretation
of
the
misrepresentation
exception
prevails,
the
tort
claims
act
itself
will
be
emasculated.
what
was
intended
by
congress
to
be
a
narrow
exception
would
in
fact
swallow
the
act,
and
it
would
block
legitimate
claims
by
aggrieved
citizens
whenever
there
was
communication
in
any
form,
and
this
is
the
precise
opinion
which
this
court
rejected
in
indian
towing.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
we
believe
it
did
to
a
certain
extent,
insofar
as
courts
have
had
difficulty
drawing
a
line
in
the
continuum
between
negligence
and
negligent
misrepresentation.
it
is
our
position
that
there
are
three
factors,
and
they
are
all
factual
findings
which
must
be
made.
you
have
to
look
at
the
relationship
of
the
parties,
the
conduct
of
the
parties,
and
the
foreseeability
in
those
three
areas.
you
have
to
look
to
see
whether
or
not
this
is
in
fact
misrepresentation
or
negligence.
finally,
the
government
and
congress
under
the
title
v
of
the
1949
housing
act
created
a
program
to
assist
low-income
residents
in
the
country
to
obtain
decent
and
safe
housing.
this
purpose
of
the
act
is
being
frustrated
by
the
negligent
acts
of
the
agency
charged
with
this
responsibility.
we
contend
that
if
farmers
home
is
permitted
to
deny
ms.
neal
her
day
in
court
in
this
case,
she
and
borrowers
like
her
would
be
denied
any
opportunity
to
complain
that
farmers
home
by
the
negligence
of
its
own
employees
has
violated
a
fundamental
purpose
of
the
rural
housing
program.
farmers
home
would
be
able
to
finance
construction
of
the
very
unsafe,
substandard
homes
which
it
is
supposed
to
replace.
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
government
has
made
a
contention
that
the
administrative
relief
under
the
509(c)
program
creates
some
kind
of
exclusive
remedy.
first
of
all,
the
509(c)
program
created
the
remedy
in
order
to
get
the
program
back
on
track.
in
other
words,
congress
perceived
there
were
problems
primarily
because
adequate
inspections
weren't
being
made.
however,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
suggests
that
congress
intended
to
cut
off
or
substitute
a
remedy
in
lieu
of
the
one
provided
under
the
ftca.
in
essence,
congress
didn't
contemplate
whether
or
not
there
was
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
any
remedy
under
the
federal
torts
claim
act.
finally,
the
fear
of
vast
financial
liability
is
more
properly
addressed
to
congress.
secondly,
there
has
been
no
factual
support
of
this
vast
fear.
farmers
home
can
exercise
greater
care
in
approving
builders.
it
can
require
construction
bonds.
it
can
conduct
more
careful
inspections.
it
can
be
more
rigorous
in
requiring
contractors
to
correct
shoddy
construction,
and
in
fact,
the
claims
paid
out
under
the
509
program
have
declined
between
1981
and
1982
from
292
claims
to
106.
it
doesn't
look
to
me
that
there
is
this
vast
financial
liability
lurking
out
there.
ms.
neal
has
sufficiently
alleged
negligence
by
farmers
home
employees.
she
is
entitled
to
pursue
her
claim
by
trial.
and
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
no,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
lenny
l.
croce
it
wasn't
raised
in
any
of
the
courts
below.
