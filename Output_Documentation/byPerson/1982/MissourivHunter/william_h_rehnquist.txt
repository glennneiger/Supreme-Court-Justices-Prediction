you
say
the
convention?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
weren't
they
ratified
in
separate
legislatures
throughout
the
13
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
new
york
debate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
it's
a
rule
of
statutory
construction
even
in
the
case
where
the
state
supreme
court
is
responsible
as
the
final
arbiter
of
what
a
statute
means?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
that,
if
it's
over
and
above
the
constitutional
import
of
the
statute?
i
would
think
that
the
state
court
would
be
perfectly
free
to
use
whatever
canons
of
statutory
construction
it
felt
were
desirable,
so
long
as
it
didn't
trench
on
the
interpretation
of
the
constitutional
aspect
of
the
provision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
were
to
write
an
opinion
saying,
we
know
perfectly
well
that
our
legislature
doesn't
give
a
damn
about
the
united
states
constitution
and
we
know
that
it's
going
to
try
to
violate
it
every
chance
it
gets,
and
so
we're
going
to
construe
all
of
its
acts
that
way,
realizing
that
it
may
well
have
intended
to
trench
on
constitutional
prohibitions.
as
a
rule
of
statutory
construction,
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
is
perfectly
free
to
follow
that
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
whalen
was
this
court
sitting
as
interpreting
the
intent
of
congress,
and
i
would
think
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
would
have
the
same
relationship
as
to
intent
to
the
missouri
legislature
as
this
court
has
to
congress.
