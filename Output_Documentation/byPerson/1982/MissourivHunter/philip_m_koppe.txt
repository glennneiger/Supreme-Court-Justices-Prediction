mr.
philip
m.
koppe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
represents
the
culmination
of
a
six-year
struggle
by
the
state
of
missouri
to
enforce
the
multiple
punishment
provisions
of
missouri's
armed
criminal
action
statute,
a
statute
which
makes
it
a
separate
offense
punishable
by
a
separate
sentence
to
commit
a
felony
with
the
use,
aid
or
assistance
of
a
dangerous
or
deadly
weapon.
for
the
last
three
years,
anyway,
it
has
been
an
uphill
battle.
in
a
series
of
decisions
beginning
in
january
of
1980,
the
missouri
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment,
insofar
as
it
prohibits
multiple
punishments
for
the
same
offense,
prevents
the
state
from
convicting
a
defendant
for
both
armed
criminal
action
and
the
predicate
or
underlying
felony.
the
court
reached
its
conclusion
even
though
it
also
concluded
that
the
legislature
intended
multiple
punishments
under
both
statutes
and
even
though
those
punishments
were
assessed
in
a
single
proceeding.
twice
this
court
has
directed
the
missouri
supreme
court
to
reconsider
these
rulings,
first
in
light
of
whalen
versus
united
states,
then
again
in
light
of
albernaz
versus
the
government.
on
both
occasions,
however,
the
missouri
supreme
court
declined
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
change
its
ruling.
as
the
result
of
the
missouri
supreme
court's
adherence
to
what
we
regard
as
an
erroneous
conclusion,
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
reversed
the
respondent's
15-year
concurrent
sentence
for
armed
criminal
action,
leaving
intact
a
concurrent
10-year
sentence
for
the
predicate
felony,
which
was
robbery
in
the
first
degree.
unaffected
by
the
court's
holding
and
not
involved
in
this
case
was
a
consecutive
five-year
sentence
that
the
respondent
received
pursuant
to
an
assault
conviction
arising
out
of
the
same
transaction.
the
issue
presented
by
this
case,
then,
is
strictly
a
legal
one,
devoid
of
any
procedural
complexities
or
factual
disputes.
and
that
question
is
simply
whether
or
not
the
state,
without
offending
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
may
impose
cumulative
punishments
for
conduct
arising
from
the
same
act
or
transaction
for
both
a
compound
or
greater
offense,
in
this
case
armed
criminal
action,
and
also
the
predicate
or
lesser
included
offense,
in
this
case
robbery
in
the
first
degree.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
the
court
did,
your
honors,
and
it
found
that
the
state
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy
prohibited
only
retrial
after
acquittal.
so
this
issue
was
decided
solely
on
the
basis
of
federal
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
that's
correct.
both
cases
are
sours
versus
state.
we
refer
to
them
as
sours
i
and
ii.
sours
ii
was
on
remand
after
this
court's
decision
sending
the
case
back
following
whalen.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
that
is
not
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
opinions
of
the
two
sours
cases.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
right.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--the
court
of
appeals
in
deciding
this
particular
issue
i
think
decided
it
in
about
a
single
paragraph.
it
felt--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--the
opinion,
the
full
opinion
is
set
out
in
the
petition.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
okay.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
treat
this
issue
with
any
degree
of
specificity.
it
simply
cited
the
two
sours
cases
and
the
haggard
cases,
the
cases
that
were
decided
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
en
banc.
it
felt
it
was
bound
by
those
cases.
so
in
order
to
fully
understand
the
reasoning
behind
the
supreme
court's
decisions,
you
must
look
to
sours
i
and
ii,
a
case
called
state
versus
haggard,
where
the
court
reconsidered
this
issue
following
albernaz,
and
most
recently
in
a
case
called
state
versus
kane,
all
of
which
are
cited
in
our
brief.
all
four
of
those
opinions
are
essentially
the
same.
they
basically
state
that
since
the
legislature,
whether
intentionally
or
otherwise,
has
made
the
predicate
offense,
in
this
case
robbery
but
the
underlying
felony,
in
a
sense
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
compound
offense,
that
that
is
prohibited
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
because
it
is
the
same
offense
within
the
meaning
of
blockburger.
according
to
the
missouri
supreme
court,
when
you
apply
the
blockburger
test
you
come
up
short,
because
both
statutes
do
not
require
proof
of
an
element
that
the
other
one
does
not.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
well,
the
court
of
appeals
reached
that
decision
because
in
the
two
sours
cases
and
in
haggard
that
was
the
procedure.
there
really
wasn't
any
explication
of
why
they
did
that
until
after
this
case
was
decided.
in
state
versus
kane,
which
actually
followed
hunter
and
is
the
last
word
on
the
subject,
the
supreme
court
indicated
that
the
reason
it
would
vacate
the
armed
criminal
action
conviction
was
because
what
the
state
legislature
had
attempted
to
do
was
pass
an
enhancement
statute.
however,
the
court
reasoned
that
the
enhancement
failed
because
of
the
way
the
statute
was
phrased,
and
the
court
expressly
said
that
in
kane.
and
i
think
that
case
illustrates
more
than
anything
precisely
what
this
case
is
about.
we're
not
really
arguing
constitutional
principles
in
any
real
sense;
we're
arguing
phraseology.
basically,
the
state's
position
here
is
that
the
state
of
missouri
could
have
done
precisely
the
same
thing,
assessed
precisely
the
same
punishment
in
a
single
statute--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
that's
the
issue.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
that's
correct,
on
federal
double
jeopardy
grounds,
on
the
theory
that
that
constitutes
convictions
for
the
same
offense
within
the
meaning
of
blockburger.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
that's
correct.
basically,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
bound
by
the
earlier
decisions
of
the
missouri
supreme
court,
which
we
cite
and
discuss
in
our
brief.
those
are
sours
versus
state,
two
opinions,
and
state
versus
haggard.
so
in
order
to
determine
really
the
basis
for
the
reversal,
you
have
to
look
at
those
cases.
and
essentially--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--that's
correct.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
correct.
what
the
court
said,
and
i
know
i've
cited
it
in
my
brief,
but
basically,
when
explaining
why
they
were
vacating
what
they
had
held
to
be
the
greater
offense,
was
that
the
attempted
enhancement
which
they
had
tried
failed
because
of
its
phraseology
or
the
way
it
was
phrased.
they
expressly
make
that
statement,
and
i
think
that
that
to
me
demonstrates
an
illustration
of
again
what
this
case
really
hinges
on.
it
hinges
on
phraseology,
because
our
argument
is
that
the
state
in
this
case
could
have
passed
a
single
statute
and
assessed
exactly
the
same
punishment
for
this
particular
conduct.
and
the
missouri
supreme
court
in
effect
so
held.
the
missouri
supreme
court
flatly
stated
in
the
kane
case
that
there
was
nothing
unconstitutional
with
giving
the
defendant
an
additional
amount
of
punishment
because
of
his
use
of
a
weapon
to
commit
a
crime.
however--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--well,
when
they
concluded
that,
your
honor,
you
have
to
look
at
the
cases
they
discussed,
and
they
discussed
the
two
types
of
cases.
there
are
cases,
for
example,
emanating
from
states
like
delaware,
michigan,
maryland,
of
which
this
court
is
aware,
which
also
make
it
a
separate
offense.
then
there
are
other
states
which
have
simply
added
punishment
to
the
sentence
for
the
particular
felony
involved,
and
the
court
considered
that
the
latter
type
of
statutes
was
the
true
enhancement
statute.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
well,
of
course,
the
reason--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--that's
correct,
that's
correct.
and
simply
what
the
supreme
court
was
saying
was,
what
the
missouri
supreme
court
was
saying
is,
if
the
state
legislature
had
done
it
in
a
slightly
different
fashion,
if
it
had
taken
all
the
punishment
and
put
it
in
a
single
sentence...
excuse
me,
a
single
statute...
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
constitutional
violation.
and
what
we're
saying
is,
if
they
had
put
all
the
punishment
in
a
single
sentence
it
certainly
would
have
been
a
less
roundabout
way
of
doing
it,
but
the
fact
that
they
chose
to
do
it
in
separate
statutes
raises
no...
or
shouldn't
raise
a
constitutional
question.
now,
it
does
because
they
held
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibited
the
legislature
in
this
state
from
doing
it
in
this
fashion.
and
in
arguing
the
point
in
his
brief,
counsel
for
the
respondent
in
this
case
basically
says
that
the
role
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
single
prosecution
cases
prevents
a
state
legislature
or
congress
from
assessing
punishment
over
two
statutes,
that
it
has
to
do
with
the
distribution
of
punishments.
and
that
is
essentially
what
the
case
is
really
about.
the
missouri
supreme
court
never
actually
said
it
in
that
fashion,
but
that's
really
what
their
decision
comes
down
to.
and
what
we're
arguing
basically
is
that
this
is
simply
a
matter
of
form
over
substance,
that
this
really
doesn't
raise
any
significant
constitutional
issue,
because
the
sole
question
here
is
one
of
legislative
intent.
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
successive
prosecution
case.
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
situation
where
the
state
had
attempted
not
only
to
assess
multiple
punishments
under
two
statutes
but
to
impose
those
statutes
in
two
separate
proceedings,
then
you
would
have
an
altogether
different
issue.
then
you
would
have
a
harris
versus
oklahoma
problem,
illinois
versus
vitale,
a
brown
versus
ohio.
but
in
this
case
the
question
is
what
is
the
role
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
insofar
as
it
prohibits
multiple
punishments
for
the
same
offense.
and
of
course
we
felt
that
the
issue
was
resolved,
had
been
resolved
once
and
for
all
in
albernaz
versus
united
states,
where
this
court
in
its
last
two
sentences
of
the
opinion
says:
"the
question
of
what
punishment
are
constitutionally
permissible.
"
--talking
about
the
prohibition
against
multiple
punishments
for
the
same
offense...
"the
question
of
what
punishments
are
constitutionally
permissible
is
not
different
from
the
question
of
what
punishment
the
legislative
branch
intended
to
be
imposed.
"
"where
congress
intended,
as
it
did
here,
to
impose
multiple
punishment,
imposition
of
such
sentences
does
not
violate
the
constitution.
"
now,
the
missouri
supreme
court
on
remand
in
state
versus
haggard
seemed
to
indicate
that
these
sentences,
if
they
meant
what
they
said
and
if
binding
on
the
court,
would
prevent
the
vacation
of
the
armed
criminal
action
statute.
but
essentially
what
they
said
was,
this
is
dicta,
we
don't
have
to
follow
this
opinion.
now,
of
course,
the
delaware
supreme
court
on
remand
in
a
similar
case
also
felt
it
was
dicta,
but
also
thought
that
it
was
an
evolving
rule
that
it
was
therefore
obligated
or
should
follow.
our
argument
of
course
is
that
it
is
not
dicta
and,
notwithstanding
the
concurrence
in
the
case
which
said
that
this
statement
was
not
supported
by
either
precedent
or
logic,
we
think
it's
supported
by
both.
to
be
sure,
i
think
the
opinions
of
this
court
indicate
that
in
the
double
jeopardy
area...
in
some
of
its
opinions
i
think
it's
been
described
as
not
exactly
being
a
model
of
clarity.
justice
rehnquist
referred
to
it
as
the
sargasso
sea.
and
it
is
true
that
the
various
opinions
have
different
emphasis.
there
are
dicta
running
throughout
the
opinions.
just
when
you
think
you've
figured
out
what
the
opinion
holds,
there
is
a
footnote
that
makes
you
wonder.
but
nevertheless,
this
court
in
whalen
and
again
in
albernaz
for
really
the
first
time
took
some
time
to
attempt
to
explicate
the
rationale
that
underlies
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
single
prosecution
cases,
and
basically
indicated
that
its
role,
its
sole
role
there,
was
to
enforce
the
legislative
intent
because
it
recognized
that
the
legislative
function
to
define
crimes
and
prescribe
offenses
is
not
circumscribed
by
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
correct.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
correct.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
well,
i
think
that
brown
versus
ohio
indicates
that
there
are
some
instances
where
separate
trials
would
not
be
precluded.
i
think
this
would
be
one
of
them.
normally,
if
the
state
can
proceed
with
both
cases,
it
must.
i
think
the
rule
in
brown,
and
i
will
paraphrase
it
and
hope
i
don't
mess
it
up
too
badly,
but
basically
is
that
where
a
defendant
is
tried
and
convicted
of
a
crime
which
includes
within
it
various
incidents,
the
defendant
cannot
be
then
tried
again
for
a
crime
which
contains
one
of
those
incidents.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
where
it
is
possible
at
the
original
proceeding
to
charge
him
with
both...
and
of
course
in
some
cases
it
may
not
be
possible.
in
jeffers,
for
example,
the
court
i
think
ruled
that
the
defendant
had
elected
to
be
tried
only
on
one,
and
in
fact--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--i'll
try
again.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
if
he's
tried
for
both
at
one
proceeding
and
one
is
set
aside.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
in
that
instance
i
think
they
can,
right.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
there
would
be
two
trials.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
well,
it
isn't
limited...
i
mean,
it
is
except
in
those
situations
that
would
be
exceptions
to
the
brown
rule.
in
other
words,
there
are
exceptions--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--correct,
that
would
be
our
position.
however,
the
chances
of
that
happening
it
seems
to
me
would
be
very
rare.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
i'm
not
aware
of
its
happening.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
but
regardless,
that's
correct.
in
other
words,
we're
not
asking
for
immunity
from
the
successive
prosecution
rule
in
brown,
but
brown
does
admit
of
some
exceptions.
that's
all
we're
saying.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
right.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
for
purposes...
in
the
state
of
missouri--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--state
law
would
make
no
distinction
here.
for
example,
there
are
various
possible
collateral
consequences.
the
most
obvious
is
the
recidivism
statute.
however--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--well,
it
would
not
be,
for
this
reasons.
there
are
three
categories
under
the
recidivism
act.
the
first
is
a
prior
offender,
which
requires
only
one
prior.
the
third
category
is
dangerous,
which
requires
only
one
prior
dangerous.
the
middle
category
is
persistent,
which
does
require
two.
however,
the
statute
expressly
states
that
you
may
not
use
more
than
one
arising
out
of
the
same
transaction.
but
that
really
gets
to
the
argument
that
i
was
making.
if
there
is
some
constitutional
problem
with
the
state
labeling...
and
i'm
saying
this
is
what
we're
talking
about,
is
labels.
if
there
is
some
constitutional
inhibition
based
on
the
state's
labeling
of
conduct
which
the
state
might
otherwise
have
characterized
as
one
offense,
labeling
that
as
two,
it
would
be
because
of
possible
collateral
consequences.
but
what
i
argue
in
my
brief
under
subsection
d
is
this:
that
we
could
make
this
a
single
crime,
punishable
by
a
single
extended
sentence,
and
still
bring
into
account
those
collateral
consequences.
for
example,
take
the
recidivism
statute.
at
the
present
time
missouri
does
not
allow
you
to
use
two
for
purposes
of
the
persistent
or
dangerous
offender
act
if
they
arise
from
the
same
transaction.
suppose,
however,
that
the
state
were
to
tomorrow
amend
the
statute
and
make
no
distinction.
then
you
might
say
that
the
defendant,
by
receiving
two
convictions
for
this
particular
course
of
conduct,
is
in
a
worse
position,
and
he
would
be.
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
under
the
blockburger
rule
what
the
state
of
missouri
could
do
is
go
back
and
rewrite
the
statute
and
make
it
a
single
offense
punishable
by
a
single
extended
statute...
excuse
me...
extended
sentence,
but
then
say:
nothing
to
the
contrary
withstanding
in
the
statute
on
the
persistent
and
dangerous
offender
act,
a
conviction
which
is
enhanced
because
of
the
defendant's
use
of
a
weapon
may
serve
to
implement
the
provisions
of
the
persistent
and
dangerous
offender
act.
another
possible
collateral
consequence
would
come
into
effect,
for
example,
if
the
defendant
was
reconvicted
and
took
the
stand.
the
argument
would
be,
well,
now
you
have
two
convictions
instead
of
one
that
he
could
be
impeached
with.
present
missouri
law
would
allow
only
impeachment
on
the
basis
of
actual
convictions.
however,
once
again
the
state
could
simply
make
it
a
single
sentence
and
include
as
part
of
the
punishment
the
fact
that,
nothing
withstanding
in
any
other
statutes
be...
a
sentence
which
has
been
enhanced
because
of
the
defendant's
use
of
the
weapon,
that
enhancement
may
be
used
to
impeach
his
credibility.
so
essentially
what
i'm
saying
is,
you
can
accomplish...
anything
that
you
can
accomplish
in
two
statutes,
you
can
accomplish
in
one.
and
so
if
there's
going
to
be
any
inquiry
with
respect
to
the
punishment
imposed
here,
it
would
be
whether
or
not
the
total
punishment,
the
total
punishment,
whether
you're
talking
about
direct
punishment
or
collateral
consequences,
whether
that
punishment
would
be
excessive
or
whether
that
punishment
would
be
cruel
and
unusual.
but
this...
you
know,
that
involves
some
other
provision
of
the
constitution,
the
eight
amendment.
that
is
not
the
fifth
amendment.
our
argument
is
basically
that
when
you're
talking
about
the
fifth
amendment
in
single
prosecution
cases
that
the
role
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
acts
as
a
restraint
on
courts
and
prosecutors
and
protects
a
defendant
against
receiving
more
punishment
than
what
the
legislative
branch
intended
he
receive.
now,
when
we
made
this
argument
in
the
supreme
court
basically
what
they
said,
among
other
things,
was
that,
well,
you
have
created
a
rule
which
has
immunized
the
legislative
branch
from
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
we
think
really
that
that
begs
the
question,
because
if
the
protection,
as
we
argue,
is
designed
to
ensure
that
a
defendant
does
not
receive
more
punishment
than
what
the
legislature
imposed,
it
really
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
say,
well,
you've
immunized
the
legislature
from
the
scope
of
the
clause,
because
basically
what
we've
said
is
that
the
clause
is
designed
to
protect
a
defendant
from
courts
and
prosecutorial
overreaching.
and
in
this
case,
unlike
many
of
the
others
that
this
court
has
had
to
decide
in
this
area,
there
is
no
question
about
the
legislative
intent.
not
only
does
the
statute,
like
its
federal
counterpart...
not
only
does
the
statute
indicate
that
the
punishment
shall
be
in
addition
to
the
punishment
for
the
underlying
felony,
but
the
missouri--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--no,
your
honor.
what
i'm
asking
is
that
this
court--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--interpret
it
precisely
the
way
the
court
has
interpreted
it.
what
i
was
starting
to
say
was,
not
only
does
the
statute--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--right,
because
what
i
was
saying
is,
not
only
does
the
statute
on
its
face
state
that
the
punishment
is
to
be
in
addition
to,
but
the
supreme
court--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--well,
i
was
trying
to
make
one
point.
i'll
make
two.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
what
i
was
starting
to
say
was,
not
only
does
the
statute,
the
armed
criminal
action
statute,
state
that
the
punishment
is
to
be
in
addition
to,
but
it
has
been
construed
in
that
fashion
at
least
on
four
occasions
by
the
missouri
supreme
court.
now,
with
respect
to
your
question,
again
getting
back
to
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals'
authority
was
state
cases,
but
those
state
cases,
the
two
sours
cases
and
the
haggard
cases,
were
decided
solely
on
federal
constitutional
grounds.
and
what
i
am
saying
is,
in
order
to
determine
exactly
what
the
federal
question
was
you
need
to
look
at
these
cases,
these
two
sours
cases
and
the
haggard
cases.
obviously,
if
you
look
no
farther
than
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
you
might
be
somewhat
puzzled,
because
it
doesn't
mention
the
constitution.
but
the
statutes
that
those
cases...
excuse
me...
the
cases--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--well,
it
isn't
the
interpretation
of
the
state
law
that
we're
arguing
about.
it
is...
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
missouri
and
the
respondent,
for
that
matter,
all
agree
on
the
interpretation
of
the
state
statute.
we
all
agree
that
the
legislature
intended
that
the
defendant
receive
punishment
under
both
statutes.
the
question,
however,
is
can
the
state
constitutionally
enforce
that
intent.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
well,
in
the
first
instance,
it
is
our
position
that
in
a
sense
it
is
an
enhancement
statute.
its
effect
is
exactly
the
same--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--that's
correct.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
we
would
have
avoided
the
problem
altogether.
the
problem,
of
course,
is
in
attempting
to
get
the
legislature
to
pass
a
particular
act
in
a
particular
form.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
well,
as
simple
as
it
sounds,
i
think
as
this
court
perhaps
knows--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--it's
easier
said
than
done.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
that
may
be
true,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
that's
the
whole
point.
if
you
said,
well,
what
would
be
the
impact,
i
mean,
if
we
didn't
have
in
excess
of
100
cases
where
the
defendants
lost
their
armed
criminal
action
convictions,
in
a
sense
it
really
wouldn't
be
that
big
of
an
impact.
the
fact
remains,
however,
that
this
statute
has
been
in
effect
for
some
six
years
and,
as
this
court
knows
from
simply
the
cases
that
are
presently
pending
in
certiorari--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--that's
true.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
and
if
in
fact
the
court
had
vacated
the
ten-year
sentence,
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
problem.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
but
again,
what
it
comes
down
to
and
what
we're
saying
is,
admittedly
if
the
legislature
had
done
this
a
little
different
way
there
wouldn't
have
been
this
problem,
we
wouldn't
be
here;
this
court
would
be
listening
to
another
case.
the
fact
remains,
the
legislature
did
it
this
way,
and
so
the
question
is
whether
in
single
prosecution
cases
the
fifth
amendment's
prohibition
against
multiple
punishments
serves
as
some
literary
critique
on
how
the
legislature
chose
to
enact
the
enhancement
statute.
in
other
words,
we're
saying
that
this
is
an
enhancement
statute.
it
may
not
be
fashioned
in
the
way
that
you
would
normally
think
of
as
an
enhancement
statute,
but
it
accomplishes
precisely
the
same
thing.
it
accomplishes
no
more
than
they
could
have
accomplished
in
a
single
statute.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
right.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
right.
and
of
course,
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
i
think
the
legislators,
if
they
considered
this
question
at
all,
thought
that
the
blockburger
rule
had
been
satisfied
because
in
the
abstract,
in
the
abstract...
and
i
think
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
in
whalen
goes
into
great
detail
on
this...
in
the
abstract
it
does
satisfy
the
test.
however,
as
applied
in
any
given
situation,
obviously
whatever
felony
you
prove
up
is
not
going
to
require
any
additional
elements.
but
in
the
abstract,
as
in
whalen,
for
example,
which
involved
felony
murder
and
i
think
a
rape,
the
underlying
felony
did
not
have
to
be
rape.
it
could
have
been
something
else.
and
likewise,
the
homicide
didn't
require
a
rape.
so
in
the
abstract
it
did
meet
the
statute,
and
of
course
that's
what
the
missouri
supreme
court
said
at
first,
and
then
they
basically
altered
their
method
of
applying
the
blockburger
rule.
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
blockburger
rule
is,
as
this
court
said
it
was
in
ianelli,
in
whalen
and
in
albernaz.
in
single
prosecution
cases,
anyway,
it's
simply
a
rule
to
define
legislative
intent.
and
basically
what
we're
saying
is,
it
can't
be
both.
it
can't
on
the
one
hand
be
a
rule...
not
consistently.
it
can't
on
the
one
hand
be
a
rule
which
seeks
to
ascertain
legislative
intent
and
then,
when
it
finds
it,
turns
it
inside
out
and
defeats
that
intent.
and
of
course,
that's
what
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
used
blockburger
for.
it
applied
blockburger
not
as
rule
of
statutory
construction,
but
as
a
constitutional
litmus
test.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
right.
and
there's
also
a
statement
in
whalen
that
we
rely
on
which
says,
in
discussing
the
blockburger
test,
after
stating
that
it
is
a
rule
of
statutory
construction,
it
says,
and
where
the
offenses
are
the
same
under
that
test...
and
that's
what
the
missouri
supreme
court
said
here...
where
they
are
the
same,
cumulative
sentences
are
not
permitted
unless
elsewhere
specifically
authorized
by
congress.
well,
you
substitute
the
words
"state
legislature"
for
"congress",
and
again
that
holding
supports
us
in
its
entirety.
but
again,
the
missouri
supreme
court
elected
not
to
follow
that
particular
language
on
the
belief
that
the
conclusion
urged
by
the
state
would
mean
that
the
conclusion
urged
by
the
state
would
mean
that
the
legislature
would
have
been
immunized
from
the
scope
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
that
we
say
really
begs
the
question.
thank
you.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
if
i
haven't
exhausted
my
rebuttal
time.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
thank
you.
well,
just
one
thing
i
did
mean
to
add,
and
that
simply
is
i
think,
as
i
argued
in
my
opening
remarks,
this
issue
is
simply
a
case
of
form
over
substance,
and
i
think
the
punishments
assessed
in
this
case
illustrate
this
better
than
anything
else.
basically,
what
the
respondent
says
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
applied
to
single
prosecution
cases
prevents
the
legislature
from
distributing
punishment
it
might
otherwise
have
assessed
over
two
statutes.
now,
what
possible
rationale
could
there
be
for
that?
look
at
this
particular
case.
if
the
state
legislature
had
done
the
statute
the
way
the
missouri
supreme
court
says
they
should
have,
what
they
would
have
done
was
allowed
the
assessment
of
an
additional
term
of
years
onto
the
original
robbery
sentence.
if
they
had
accomplished
that,
what
the
defendant
would
have
received
was
a
ten-year
sentence
for
robbery,
enhanced
by
15
years,
making
a
total
of
25
years.
but
since
the
statutes
assess
the
punishment
separately,
the
judge
was
given
the
discretion
to
run
those
sentences
concurrently.
the
defendant
received
the
benefit
of
those
concurrent
sentences
and
wound
up
with
15
years.
he's
actually
in
a
better
position
than
he
would
have
been
had--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--that's
true.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
well,
except
that
his
freedom
was
constrained
by
what
the
jury
returned.
he
could
not
have
assessed
a
penalty
in
excess
of
whatever
it
was
the
jury...
the
jury
in
this
instance
decided
the
punishment.
he
had
the
discretion--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--right,
and
the
jury
assessed
the
punishment
under
both
statutes,
and
the
judge's
discretion
was
limited
to
either
running
the
sentences
concurrently
or
consecutively.
he
also
had
the
discretion,
of
course,
to
reduce
the
sentences,
discretion
that
is
very
rarely
utilized.
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
i
think
that
would
be
permissible
and
i
think
some
states,
in
reliance
on
this
court's
opinion
in
albernaz,
have
done
precisely
that.
for
example,
looking
at
the
punishment
scheme
to
find
legislative
intent.
but
this
court's
inquiry
is--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--that
would
certainly
be
our
position.
in
response
to
judge
rehnquist's
question,
i
don't
think
the
court
was...
the
state
court
is
constitutionally
compelled
to
use
the
blockburger
rule,
and
in
this
case
they
didn't
have
to
use
any
rule.
the
intent
was
clear,
and
we
submit
this
does
not
raise
a
fifth
amendment
issue--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--well,
if
the
intent
were...
if
the
intent
were--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--that's
correct.
in
other
words,
we
wouldn't
take
the
position
if
the
supreme
court
had
said
we
find
no
intent
to
punish
under
both
statutes--
mr.
philip
m.
koppe
--and
yet
but
we're
going
to
allow
that.
we...
i
don't
agree
that
wouldn't
raise
a
fifth
amendment
problem.
i
think
it
would.
i
wouldn't
be
here
arguing
that
they
could
punish
under
both
statutes
unless
there
was
this
intent
found
by
the
highest
state
court.
we
have
it
here,
and
therefore
i
submit
that
this
is...
raises
no
constitutional
question
under
the
fifth
amendment.
thank
you.
