justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
koppe,
your
court
of
appeals
chose
to
vacate
the
longer
of
the
two
concurrent
sentences,
didn't
they?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
anything
in
state
law
that
compels
that
result,
rather
than
vacating
the
shorter?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
having
said
that,
don't
you
run
into
the
last
two
sentences
of
albernaz?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
they
wrong?
