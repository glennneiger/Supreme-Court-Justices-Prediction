chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
missouri
against
hunter.
mr.
koppe,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
even
more
people
to
convince
in
the
legislature
than
on
the
supreme
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
emphasize
what
you
call
the
clarity
of
the
intent
of
the
missouri
legislature,
you
are
aiming,
i
take
it,
at
the
opening
left
in
whalen,
where
the
court
said,
"in
the
absence
of
a
clear
indication
of
contrary
legislative
intent.
"
and
you
say
there
is
a
clear
indication
of
contrary
legislative
intent
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gardner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
it
may
have
an
effect
on
his
parole,
for
example,
a
negative
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he's
got
two
of
them
instead
of
one,
even
though
they're
concurrent,
would
that
impair
his,
or
affect
his
parole
in
missouri
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
does
it
speak
about
punishments
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
read
you
what
the
court
said
in
whalen,
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
just
referred
to:
692...
"where
two
statutory
provisions
proscribe
the
same
offense,
they
are
construed
not
to
authorize
cumulative
punishments
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
indication
of
contrary
legislative
intent.
"
now,
what
bearing
does
that
have
on
your
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
do
you
think
that
statement
that
i
have
just
read
from
whalen
is
an
erroneous
statement
of
the
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
koppe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
three
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion
for
the
court
to
announce
in
missouri
against
hunter.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
missouri,
western
district
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
marshall
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
joined.
