mr.
gary
l.
gardner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
is
whether
the
multiple
punishment
for
the
same
offense
protection
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits
the
imposition
of
punishment
which
the
legislature
intended
under
two
statutes
that
are
the
same
offense,
as
that
constitutional
phrase
is
defined
in
blockburger.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
because
in
albernaz
the
two
statutes
under
which
punishment
was
imposed
were
separate
offenses.
that
is,
they
each
did
not
have
an
element...
they
each
did
not
have
a
different
element.
the
two
statutes
under
which
punishment
was
imposed
in
this
case--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--more
what,
sir?
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
here
they
are
the
same;
in
albernaz
they
were
separate
offenses,
in
the
sense
that
in
this
case
there's
no
element
in
the
underlying
felony
which
is
not
in
the
greater
felony.
because
that
is
the
case,
albernaz
is
not
controlling.
it
did
not
require
the
missouri
courts
to
uphold
the
imposition
of
punishment
under
each
of
the
two
statutes.
the
missouri
courts
have
made
three
determinations
about
armed
criminal
action
and
first
degree
robbery.
they
first
determined
what
the
elements
of
those
two
crimes
are;
secondly,
they
determined
that
they
are
the
same
offense;
and
thirdly,
they
determined
that
the
missouri
general
assembly
intended
for
punishment
to
be
imposed
under
each
of
the
two
statutes.
these
three
determinations
are
binding
upon
this
court.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
tell
a
state
court
what
the
elements
of
its
state
statutes
are.
because
it
does
not,
it
is
not
a
substantive
rule
of
law.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
tell
a
state
court
whether
two
of
its
state
statutes
are
separate
offenses
or
the
same
offense.
it
only
tells
a
state
court
what
test
to
use
in
making
that
determination,
and
that
test
is
the
blockburger
test,
and
the
double
jeopardy--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--it
is
that
he
can't
receive
two
sentences
under
two
statutes
which
satisfy
the
test.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
that's
right.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
that's
right.
the
clause
prohibits
the
imposition
of
punishment
under
two
statutes,
whether
the
punishment
is
concurrent
or
not,
when
the
two
statutes
are
the
same
offense.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
the
statutory
maximum
in
each
of
these
offenses
is
life
imprisonment.
perhaps
the
only
time,
under
the
solicitor
general's
suggestion,
there
would
be
multiple
punishment
would
be,
i
think,
when
there
are
two
consecutive
life
sentences.
but
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
sentences
are
concurrent
or
consecutive
or
less
than
the
statutory
maximum.
what
matters
is
when
sentences
are
imposed
under
two
statutes
that
satisfy
the
blockburger
test,
regardless
of
the
length
of
the
sentence.
the
three
determinations...
the
third
determination
that
the
missouri
supreme
court
made
which
is
binding
on
this
court
is
that
the
missouri
general
assembly
intended
for
punishment
to
be
imposed
under
each
of
these
two
statutes.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
tell
a
state
court
whether
its
state
legislature
intended
for
punishment
to
be
imposed
under
two
statutes--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--yes,
sir,
i
would.
i
would
make
the
same
argument
if
he
got
three
and
five--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--the
multiple
punishment
is
in
the
imposition
of
the
sentences.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
well,
the
armed
criminal
action
statute
prohibits
parole
for
three
calendar
years.
so--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--assuming
there
wasn't
that
restriction
on
parole
eligibility,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
how
the
two
sentences
affect
his
parole.
parole
eligibility,
collateral
consequences,
the
length
of
the
sentence,
are
all
essentially
unimportant
to
the
violation.
the
violation
occurs
when
sentence
is
imposed
under
two
statutes
that
satisfy
the
test.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
the
missouri
supreme
court
i
think
felt
that,
because
it
vacated
both
the
conviction
and
the
sentence.
i
want
to
say
that
the
reason
the
court
chose
to
vacate
the
armed
criminal
action
conviction
and
sentence
rather
than
the
underlying
felony
sentence
was
purely
a
matter
of
remedy.
it
did
not
feel
that
the
constitution
compelled
the
vacation
of
one
sentence
rather
than
the
other.
it
had
no
aversion
to
the
crime
of
armed
criminal
action.
it
chose
to
vacate
the
armed
criminal
action
sentence
because
in
over
95
percent
of
the
cases
it
saw
the
shorter
of
the
two
sentences
was
imposed
on
armed
criminal
action.
this
is
one
of
the
few
unusual
cases
where
the
longer
of
the
two
sentences
was
imposed
by
the
jury
and
the
judge
on
armed
criminal
action.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
yes,
it
could.
the
missouri
general
assembly's
intent
in
enacting
the
armed
criminal
action
was
to
authorize
the
imposition
of
punishment,
the
imposition
of
additional
punishment
for
the
use
of
a
weapon
to
commit
a
felony.
the
missouri
supreme
court
recognized
that
intent,
it
recognized
the
wisdom
of
that
intent.
but
it
directed
the
general
assembly
how
to
constitutionally
carry
out
that
intent.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
well,
the
policy
is
that
there
shall
be
no
multiple
punishment
for
the
same
offense,
and
when
we
have
two
statutes
that--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--the
constitution
assumes
that
out
of
a
multiplicity
of
statutes,
some
of
them
may
only
differently
describe
the
same
offense.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
one
of
their
concerns
was
to
ensure
that
there
was
no
multiple
punishment
for
the
same
offense.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
well,
the
clause
itself
doesn't...
the
clause
itself
says
a
person
shall
not
be
twice
put
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
offense,
and
this
court
has
said
that
one
of
the
three
parts
of
that
clause
is
that
there
shall
be
no
multiple
punishment
for
the
same
offense.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
think
the
first
draft
of
the
fifth
amendment
reflects
more
clearly
than
the
final
draft
that
that
was
their
concern.
i
think
some
of
the
comments
of
the
representatives
at
the
convention
reflect
more
clearly
that
the
concern
was
for
multiple
punishment
for
the
same
offense.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
meant,
your
honor,
when
the
states
gathered
to
ratify
the
bill
of
rights.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
think
they
were,
your
honor.
i'm
thinking
of
a
representative
from
new
york.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
yes.
punishment
may
not
be
imposed
under
two
statutes
that
are
the
same
offense,
even
if
the
legislature
has
authorized
it,
because
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
a
restraint
or
a
limitation
upon
the
power
of
the
legislature.
the
clause
limits
the
power
of
the
legislature
to
authorize
punishment
under
two
statutes
that
are
the
same
offense.
it
does
not
limit
the
power
of
the
legislature
to
define
a
crime
or
to
fix
the
punishment
for
that
crime.
the
missouri
general
assembly
defined
the
crime
of
armed
criminal
action
as
the
use
of
a
weapon
to
commit
a
felony.
the
missouri
supreme
court
did
not
find
that
crime
to
be
unconstitutional.
the
missouri
general
assembly
fixed
the
punishment
for
armed
criminal
action
at
three
years
to
life
imprisonment.
the
missouri
supreme
court
did
not
find
that
punishment
to
be
unconstitutional.
but
the
general
assembly
authorized
the
punishment
for
armed
criminal
action
to
be
in
addition
to
the
punishment
for
the
underlying
felony.
this
is
the
portion--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--that's
my
position,
your
honor.
the
only
portion
of
the
statute
which
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional
was
the
multiple
punishment
provisions.
sentences
for
armed
criminal
action
alone
exist
in
missouri.
men
have
been
sentenced
to
serve
a
number
of
years
in
the
penitentiary
upon
only
a
conviction
for
armed
criminal
action.
but
sentences
for
both
armed
criminal
action
and
the
underlying
felony
do
not
exist.
because
the
intent
to
punish
additionally
for
the
use
of
a
weapon
may
be
constitutionally
carried
out
in
an
enhancement
statute
does
not
mean
that
the
manner
in
which
this
intent
was
carried
out
in
the
armed
criminal
action
statute
becomes
constitutional,
and
it
does
not
mean
that
the
multiple
punishment
for
the
same
offense
protection
doesn't
exist.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
if
a
sentence
was
imposed,
it
would
be.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
well,
your
honor,
one
of
the
three
protections
of
the
clause
is
that
there
shall
be
no
multiple
punishment
for
the
same
offense.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
that
is
what
this
court
has
said
to
be--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--it
comes
from
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
the
multiple
punishment--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--it
does.
the
multiple
punishment
words
are
not
in
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
this
court
has
said
that
the
fifth
amendment
means
that.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
the
blockburger
test
is
a
rule
of
constitutional
magnitude
which
prohibits
the
imposition
of
punishment
under
two
statutes
that
are
the
same
offense,
even
if
the
legislature
intended
it.
it
is
not
solely
a
rule
of
statutory
construction
which,
because
it
serves
the
discerned
legislative
intent,
may
be
overcome
by
a
clear
indication
of
a
contrary
legislative
intent.
it
is
both
a
rule
of
constitutional
magnitude
and
a
rule
of
statutory
construction,
but
in
its
role
as
a
rule
of
statutory
construction
it
is
secondary
to
and
derivative
from
the
constitutional
magnitude
rule.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
only
in
a
certain
very
limited
sense.
the
clause
does
not
tell
a
state
court
what
the
elements
of
its
statutes
are.
the
clause
does
not
tell
a
state
court
whether
it's...
but
it
tells
the
state
court
what
test
to
use
once
it
has
found
those
elements
to
determine
whether
those
two
statutes
are
the
same
offense
or
separate
offenses.
the
clause
does
not
tell
a
state
court
whether
its
state
legislature
intended
for
punishment
to
be
imposed
under
two
statutes.
but
it
does
require
the
state
court
to
use
a
certain
presumption
in
determining
that
intent.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
the
canon
that
i'm
referring
to
as
the
presumption
that
it's
required
to
use
is
merely
the
canon
that
the
state
legislature
acts
with
the
constitution
in
mind.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
yes,
sir,
i
mean
that.
if
they
had
done
that--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--we
would
not
be
here,
neither
the
state
nor
i.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
it
is
not
free...
i
think
whalen
is
the
answer
to
the
question.
it
is
not
free
to
construe,
in
the
absence
of
an
express
declaration
of
legislative
intent.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
think
a
state
court
is
not
free
to
construe
that
its
state
legislature
intended
for
punishment
to
be
imposed
under
two
statutes
that
are
the
same
offense
in
the
absence
of
an
express
declaration
of
that
intent.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
in
this
case
we
have
the
presence
of
a
clear
indication
of
a
contrary
legislative
intent,
the
part
in
the
armed
criminal
action
statute
that
authorized
guilt
of
armed
criminal
action
and
punishment
in
addition
to
the
underlying
felony.
but
the
overcoming
of
this
presumption
that
the
legislature
does
not
intend
to
punish
under
two
statutes
that
are
the
same
offense
does
not
mean
that
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
to
do
so,
because
the
clause
is
a
restraint
upon
the
power
of
the
legislature
to
make
that
authorization,
to
authorize
punishment
under
two
statutes
that
are
the
same
offense.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
it
is
not
erroneous,
your
honor.
it
only
goes
so
far.
it
doesn't
state
the
entire
law.
it
applies
directly
to
the
situation
where
two
statutes
are
the
same
offense
and
there's
no
express
declaration
of
congress'
intent
to
punish
under
each.
as
far
as
that
is
concerned,
the
statement
is
correct.
but
where
you
have
an
express
declaration
of
an
intent
to
punish
under
each,
the
statement
doesn't
state
all
of
the
law.
the
rest
of
the
law
is
that
the
authorization
cannot
be
made
because
the
clause
is
a
restraint
upon
the
power
of
the
legislature
to
make
that
authorization.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
sure
do.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
they're
correct
in
the
context
of
albernaz
only.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
it
did.
he's
the
author
of
those
two
phrases
from
whalen.
however,
you
must
keep
in
mind
the
facts
of
albernaz
and
the
difference
between
those
facts
and
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
that's
correct.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
which
makes
the
albernaz
opinion
not
controlling
authority
for
the
missouri
supreme
court.
it
makes
the
two
sentences
in
albernaz
a
general
expression
of
law
which
must
be
understood
in
the
context
of
that
case,
that
is
the
two
statutes
for
separate
offenses.
it
is
correct
when
you
have
separate
offenses,
because
of
course
there's
no
prohibition
for
punishing
under
two
statutes
that
are
separate
offenses.
it's
just
not
correct
when
you
have
the
same
offense,
as
you
have
in
this
case.
missouri
claims
that
in
the
single
prosecution
context
the
blockburger
test
is
solely
a
rule
of
statutory
construction,
limited
to
assuring
that
the
courts
do
not
impose
more
punishment
than
the
legislature
has
authorized.
on
the
other
hand,
it
claims
that
in
the
successive
prosecution
context
it's
a
rule
of
constitutional
magnitude
which
prohibits
the
imposition
of
punishment
under
two
statutes
even
if
that
is
what
the
legislature
intended.
it
makes
this
claim
because
it
believes
that
in
the
successive
prosecution
context
the
clause
embodies
a
policy
other
than
that
of
avoiding
multiple
punishment.
of
course,
in
a
reprosecution
after
an
acquittal
the
clause
embodies
a
policy
of
not
permitting
the
state
an
opportunity
to
convict
those
who
have
already
been
found
to
be
not
guilty.
but
in
a
reprosecution
after
a
conviction
the
clause
embodies
no
policy
other
than
that
of
avoiding
multiple
punishment.
in
brown
against
ohio
this
court
stated
that
it
was
avoiding
multiple
punishment
which
came
about
as
the
result
of
a
reprosecution
after
conviction.
it
specifically
disavowed
it
was
avoiding
the
repetition
of
proof
or
having
the
defendant
undergo
two
trials.
missouri's
request
for
you
to
declare
the
blockburger
test
to
be
solely
a
rule
of
statutory
construction
lays
the
foundation
of
the
eventual
abolition
of
the
protection
against
reprosecution
after
conviction,
in
addition
to
the
abolition
of
the
protection
against
multiple
punishment
for
the
same
offense.
in
addition
to
albernaz
and
whalen,
missouri
has
cited
other
decisions
of
this
court
which
it
claims
to
be
controlling
authority
which
should
have
required
the
missouri
courts
to
affirm
the
armed
criminal
action
convictions.
one
of
those
is
brintley
against
michigan.
in
brintley
against
michigan
this
court
dismissed
an
appeal
for
want
of
a
substantial
federal
question.
that
case
is
not
controlling
authority
for
the
same
reason
that
albernaz
is
not
controlling
authority:
the
two
statutes
in
michigan
were
construed
to
be,
by
the
michigan
court,
to
be
separate
offenses,
not
the
same
offense.
therefore,
in
dismissing
the
appeal
in
brintley
against
michigan
this
court
was
merely
applying
an
established
principle
to
a
particular
fact
situation,
the
principle
being
the
punishment
may
be
imposed
for
two
statutes
that
are
separate
offenses,
the
particular
situation
being
the
two
michigan
statutes
being
construed
to
be
separate
offenses.
in
conclusion,
to
declare
the
blockburger
test
to
be
solely
a
rule
of
statutory
construction
is
to
abandon
to
the
legislature
this
court's
constitutional
duty
to
determine
the
meaning
of
the
constitutional
phrase
"the
same
offense".
if
it
is
solely
a
rule
of
statutory
construction,
then
it
is
the
legislature
that
determines
the
meaning
of
the
constitutional
phrase
"the
same
offense".
by
merely
declaring
its
intent
to
punish
under
two
statutes
that
otherwise
would
be
the
same
offense,
the
legislature
can
make
those
statutes
to
be
not
the
same
offense.
by
declaring
the
multiple
punishment
provision
of
the
armed
criminal
action
statute
to
be
in
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
this
court
can
bring
the
legislative
power
to
the
judgment
of
the
superior
power
of
the
constitution
and
yet
still
recognize
the
power
of
the
legislature
to
define
crimes
and
fix
punishment.
thank
you.
