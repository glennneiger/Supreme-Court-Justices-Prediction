justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
you
said
that
in
one
of
those
earlier
cases,
not
sours
but
the
other
one,
i
think
it
was,
that
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
said
that
the
legislature
had
attempted
to
enact
an
enhancement
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
certainly
the
way
i
would
have
read
it,
very
frankly.
but
it
failed
because
of
the
language
of
the
statute.
but
the
legislative
intent
was
simply
an
enhancement
statute,
rather
than
to
create
a
second
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
koppe,
how
do
you
answer
justice
white's
question?
i
still
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
white's
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
he
be
tried
the
second
time
under
your
view
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
supreme
court
reverses
the
enhanced
offense,
the
armed
conviction,
then
they
send
it
back
for
trial.
can
they
try
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
would
be
two
trials
for
the
same
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
so
your
rule
isn't
limited
to
multiple
punishments
for
single
trials.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
those
cases
you
would
agree
that
for
the
same
offense
there
can
be
successive
prosecutions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
they
be
rare?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
only
asking
for
the
immunity
from
that
rule
where
one
of
the
convictions
for
the
same
offense
has
been
affirmed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
may
i
ask
a
different
question.
supposing
you
have
a
man
who
is
convicted
of
both
offenses,
as
is
true
here.
when
you
have
other
collateral
consequences,
such
as
parole
or
maybe
aggravating
circumstances
for
a
death
penalty
or
something
like
that,
is
this
treated
as
having
been
convicted
of
two
felonies
or
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
would
be
two
felonies
for
that
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
that.
i
guess
the
language
that
troubles
the
missouri
supreme
court
is
the
language,
"is
also
guilty
of
the
crime
of
armed
criminal
action,
and
upon
conviction.
"
and
so
forth.
if
they
took
those
words
out
it
would
be
clearly
just
an
enhancement
statute.
and
you
mentioned
the
difficulty
of
six
years
of
straightening
out
the
supreme
court.
i
just
wonder
why
you
didn't
go
back
to
the
legislature
and
say,
all
you
have
to
do
is
strike
three
or
four
words
out
of
this
statute
and
our
problem
is
solved,
because
it's
perfectly
clear
that
an
enhancement
statute
is
constitutionally
unobjectionable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
other
words,
the
effect
could
be
the
same
and
for
prosecutorial
purposes
for
the
state
of
missouri
you'd
be
perfectly
happy
not
to
define
it
as
a
separate
offense,
but
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
it
is
not
only
the
functional
equivalent
of
an
enhancement
statute,
but
it
should
be
amended
to
be
nothing
more
than
an
enhancement
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
did
that
you'd
avoid
the
problem
that
justice
white
identified.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
it
is,
just
a
clarifying
amendment,
really.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
easier
to
deal
with
the
missouri
supreme
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
funny
thing
about
this
case
is
that
without
the
enhancement
you
had
a
life
sentence
available
to
the
trial
judge
anyway.
in
this
particular
case
you
didn't
even
need
the
enhancement
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
sort
of
a
tempest
in
a
teapot.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
have
done
that
consistently
with
the
missouri
court's
understanding
of
the
federal
constitution,
even
if
that
may
be
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
put
the
other
side
of
that
same
argument
is,
if
one
construed
the
blockburger
rule
in
the
old-fashioned
way...
and
i
understand
that
the
albernaz
case
supports
you
very
strongly...
and
said,
well,
you
just
make
it
an
enhancement
statute
when
you
do,
that
rule
of
law
would
have
provided
no
obstacle
to
the
trial
judge
giving
this
man
a
life
sentence,
no
obstacle
to
the
appellate
court
setting
aside
the
shorter
sentence
instead
of
the
longer
sentence,
and
no
obstacle
to
the
legislature
giving
you
exactly
what
you
want.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
constitutional
rule
is
no
problem,
except
when
they
draft
a
kind
of
a
strange
statute
like
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gardner,
i
understand
you
apparently
want
to
come
within
the
language
in
a
prior
case
that
talks
about
multiple
punishment
for
the
same
offense.
i
wonder
if
you
really
aren't
arguing
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits
multiple
convictions
for
the
same
offense.
that
seems
to
be
the
heart
of
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
last
two
sentences
of
albernaz
is
plainly
wrong,
of
course.
it
says:
the
question
of
what
punishments
are
constitutionally
permissible
is
not
different
from
the
question
of
what
punishment
the
legislative
intended
to
be
imposed.
"that's
plainly
wrong
insofar
as
it
ignores
the
eighth
amendment,
for
example,
isn't
that
true?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
surely
that
sentence
wasn't
necessary
to
the
decision
in
that
case,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
the
other
statute
you
propose
he
could
have
also
imposed
the
same
sentence.
nothing
in
the
statute...
none
of
these
statutes
limit
the
discretion
of
the
judge,
except
he
has
to
give
at
least
three
years
under
one
and
five
years
under
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
really,
he
could
have
done...
he
had
total
freedom
under
either
this
statute
or
the
substitute
you
propose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
jury
had
to
find
him
guilty
of
robbery
in
order
to
find
him
guilty
of
armed
criminal--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
rely
at
all
on
the
clarity
of
the
statement
of
the
intent
of
the
legislature
to
define
two
separate...
to
have
an
enhancement
situation
where
he
can
add
to
the
penalty?
does
it
make
any...
would
it
make
any
difference
if
you
had
two
statutory
provisions
buried
in
different
parts
of
the
criminal
code,
nobody
found
until
a
particular
trial,
and
the
prosecutor
thought
he'd
like
to
get
a
severe
punishment
in
a
particular
case
and
so
he
tried
to
prosecute
under
both
statutes,
but
there
was
nothing
to
show
what
the
legislature
thought?
then
say,
the
court
might
say,
well,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
as
justice
rehnquist
suggested,
we
construe
the
intent
of
the
legislature
to
be
we
want
double
punishment
whenever
there
are
two
descriptions
of
the
same
offense
that
can
be
found
in
the
code.
that
would
be
permissible,
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
no
real
requirement
of
any...
there
is
no
federal
requirement
about
the
way
the
state
legislature
must
express
its
intent.
whenever
there
are
two
descriptions
of
the
same
offense,
multiple
punishment
is
constitutionally
permissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
position
would
be
the
same,
even
if
the
intent
were
not
clear,
is
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
long
as
the
state
supreme
court
says
that's
the
rule
in
this
state.
