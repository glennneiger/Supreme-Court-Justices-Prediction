justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
koppe,
has
your
supreme
court
ever
addressed
that
question
under
the
state
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--and
the
blockburger
test
is
that
the
defendant
can't
receive
two
sentences,
or
is
it
that
he
can't
be
sentenced
to
more
than
he
could
have
gotten
on
one
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
here
he
got
concurrent
sentences.
under
each
conviction,
as
i
understand
it,
he
could
have
been
given
life;
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
instead
of
which,
he
got
10
on
one,
15
on
the
other,
but
to
be
concurrent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
he
got
ten
years
on
each
to
run
concurrently?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
where's
the
multiple
punishment
if
he
serves
only
ten
years?
where's
the
multiple
punishment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
your
position
would
be,
had
the
sentence
for
armed
criminal
action
been
less
than
that
imposed
for
the
robbery
that
it
would
still
be...
the
sentence
for
the
armed
criminal
action
would
still
be
unconstitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
carried
to
a
logical
extreme,
i
suppose
if
there
had
been
a
sentence
imposed
on
the
armed
criminal
action
conviction,
but
suspended,
he
never
had
to
serve
a
day
under
it,
you'd
still
say
it
was
unconstitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it,
though,
mr.
gardner,
if
your
supreme
court
had
taken
this
very
statute,
this
very
one,
and
said,
well,
we
construe
that
statute
to
mean
that
if
there's
also
a
conviction
for
armed
criminal
action,
that's
merely
a
basis
for
enhancement
of
the
sentence
imposed
for
the
underlying
felony,
if
they
had
done
that,
you
couldn't...
you
wouldn't
be
here,
i
gather?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
not
be
here.
