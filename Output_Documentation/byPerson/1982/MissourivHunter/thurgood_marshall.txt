where
is
that
in
the
opinion?
is
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it's
not
in
the
opinion
that's
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
pass
on
this
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that?
i
didn't
find
that,
even.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know.
that's
all
right.
if
it's
in
there,
i
look
at
it.
i'll
look
for
it.
you
don't
have
to
look
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
koppe,
i
hate
to
bother
you,
but
the
third
page
of
the
opinion
in
the
second
full
paragraph,
talking
about
double
jeopardy,
as
i
read
it
says:
"under
these
decisions,
appellant's
conviction
for
armed
criminal
action
is
vacated
and
the
sentence
for
that
conviction
is
set
aside.
"
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
here?
are
you
appealing
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
issue
is
whether
they
can
set
it
aside?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
cites
two
state
cases,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
us
to
interpret
the
missouri
statute
contrary
to
what
the
missouri
court
interpreted
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
that's
what
you
just
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
put
"precisely"
in
and
you
agree?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
here
is
a
state
supreme
court
passing
upon
one
of
its
statutes,
without
mentioning
the
federal
constitution
or
any
other
thing,
and
you
want
us
to
upset
that,
and
take
your
word
for
what
the
statute
says
over
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
justice
thurgood
marshall
please.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
know
i
was
required
to
look
anyplace
else
for
the
interpretation
of
a
state
law
than
to
the
state
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hate
to
be
technical,
but
you
keep
talking
about
punishment
and
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
say
punishment.
"shall
not
be
held
to
answer.
"
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
in
the
constitution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was,
where
was
it
in
the
constitution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
fifth
amendment
says
"called
to
answer",
doesn't
it?
"shall
not
be
held
to
answer.
"
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
read
your
copy.
now
we'll
read
mine.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
