justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
case
you
referred
to
a
supreme
court
of
missouri
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
are
bound
by
their
interpretation
of
their
own
statute,
namely
that
the
legislature
didn't
pass
an
enhancement
statute,
they
passed
a
statute
which
imposed
a
separate
penalty
for
a
separate
crime.
that's
what
they
concluded
the
legislature
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
urging
us
to
say
that
not
only
may
the
legislature
pass
an
enhancement
statute,
but
it
may
do
exactly
what
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
said
it
did
and
said
it
couldn't,
namely
impose
a
separate
penalty.
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
you
saying
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
prevent
a
legislature
from
doing
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
koppe,
what
if
there
is
a
conviction
for
first
degree
robbery
and
armed
criminal
robbery,
which
there
were
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
on
appeal
the
conviction
for
first
degree
robbery
is
affirmed
and
the
armed
criminal
conviction
is
reversed
on
evidentiary
grounds
or
something,
so
there'll
be
a
new
trial.
the
armed
criminal...
the
first
degree
robbery
conviction
stands.
now
there's
going
to
be
a
separate
proceeding
about
the
armed
criminal
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
barred?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
wouldn't
help
you
out
very
much
about
past
convictions,
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
isn't
it...
why
do
you
think
this
issue
was
not
decided
in
albernaz?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
should
make
it
even
more
of
a
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
make
it
even
more
of
a
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
anyway,
you
think
the
offenses
are
just
different.
here
they're--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
albernaz,
the
last
page
of
albernaz,
just
embraced
what
justice
blackmun
said
in
whalen.
