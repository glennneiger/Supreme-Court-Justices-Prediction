mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
which
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
to
the
seventh
circuit
presents
a
question
concerning
court
authorized
and
court
supervised
disclosure
of
grand
jury
materials
to
the
internal
revenue
service
pursuant
to
rule
6(e)
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
several
issues
were
litigated
below,
but
we
confined
our
petition
for
certiorari
to
a
single
issue,
not
because
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
regarding
all
of
the
other
issues,
but
because
we
wanted
to
present
the
court
with
the
issue
of
greatest
importance
administratively
and
the
issue
that
reflects
a
long-standing
practice
of
many
years
in
the
issuance
of
rule
6(e)
orders
by
district
courts.
the
case
arises
out
of
a
special
grand
jury
investigation
of
commodity
futures
trading
transactions
before
the
chicago
board
of
trade.
the
grand
jury
was
investigating
related
criminal
violations
of
the
commodities
exchange
act
and
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
was
assisted
by
internal
revenue
service
agents
as
well
as
other
personnel
to
help
in
the
analysis
of
the
information
that
was
being
secured.
the
grand
jury
proceedings
itself
with
respect
to
mr.
baggot
culminated
in
a
guilty
plea,
which
was
accepted...
a
plea
of
guilt
to
misdemeanors
for
violations
of
the
commodities
exchange
act,
violations
that
involved
participation
in
rigged
commodity
trades
that
produced
substantial
paper
losses,
which
he
deducted
in
preparing
his
tax
return,
and
yet
he
recovered
most
of
those
losses
in
the
form
of
cash
kickbacks
from
his
trading
partners.
so,
the
guilty
plea
was
based
on
a
theory
of
violations
that
have
implications
for
tax
purposes.
after
some
preliminary
proceedings
which
are
not
important
for
purposes
of
what
is
before
this
court,
the
united
states
attorney
sought
disclosure
at
the
request
of
the
chief
of
the
examination
division
of
the
internal
revenue
service
of
the
grand
jury
materials
for
their
use
by
the
service
in
determining
whether
there
was
a
deficiency
in
mr.
baggot's
tax
return.
and,
the
question
we
have
presented
is
a
question
that
arises
under
rule
6(e)(3)(c)(i)
whether
the
disclosure
that
was
requested
here
that
would
be
permitted
in
the
absence
of
authorization
by
the
court
is
disclosure
that
would
be
directed
by
a
court
preliminarily
to
or
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding.
the
answer
is
to
be
secured
principally
from
analysis
of
the
language
in
legislative
history
of
this
provision
as
it
was
reenacted
with
a
textural
rearrangement
in
1977.
before
proceeding
to
that,
i
wish
to
make
a
few
observations
to
put
the
question
in
some
perspective
in
assessing
the
language
in
legislative
history.
the
first
is,
perhaps
the
too
obvious
point,
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
situation
that
involves
any
taint
or
impropriety
on
the
part
of
the
government.
the
investigation
of
the
grand
jury
was
conducted
as
it
was
authorized
to
be
conducted,
and
the
participation
of
the
internal
revenue
service
agents
was
in
no
way
improper.
it
is
specifically
provided
for
in
rule
6(e),
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
because
this
grand
jury
investigation
commenced
before
the
recent
amendment
of
rule
6(e)...
the
1977
amendment,
there
was
an
order
by
the
court
authorizing
the
internal
revenue
service
agents
to
participate,
to
assist
the
grand
jury
and
the
united
states
attorney
in
analyzing
the
evidence
that
was
being
secured.
and,
no
use
for
any
other
purpose
was
attempted
to
be
made
of
this
information
except
upon
application
to
the
court
to
secure
the
proper
court
order
under
rule
6(e).
so,
we
are
not
dealing
with
any
sort
of
taint
or
improper
conduct
from
that
standpoint.
nor,
is
there
a
basis
in
this
case
for
what
has
been
referred
to
as
abuse
of
the
grand
jury,
whether
or
not
it
is
a
term
of
art.
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
guilty
plea
accepted
in
the
case
certainly
indicates
that
the
grand
jury
was
not
being
used
as
a
subterfuge
for
a
non-criminal
purpose.
nor,
on
the
face
of
it
is
there
any
injustice
in
the
idea
that
when
evidentiary
materials
have
come
forth
which
indicate
not
only
a
violation
of
criminal
law
but
also
a
deficiency
in
the
payment
of
taxes
that
are
owing.
nor,
there
is
certainly
no
injustice
in
taking
steps
to
see
to
it
that
those
taxes
are
paid
by
mr.
baggot
as
they
would
be
by
any
other
taxpayer.
from
the
standpoint
of
what
seemed
to
be
the
concern
of
congress
in
1977
when
it
recodified
this
rule,
a
concern
that
a
safeguard
be
included
against
a
cat's
paw
type
of
use
of
the
grand
jury
to
obtain
evidence
for
civil
purposes
and
only
for
civil
purposes
in
ways
that
were
not
authorized
to
the
agencies
to
obtain
their
evidence--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
also
my
understanding
of
what
this
court
said
in
proctor
&
gamble.
it
said
much
the
same
thing
in
a
case
called
united
states
against
kordel,
397
u.s.
1,
where
the
complaint
was
made
the
other
way
around
that
the
civil
investigation
was
being
used
to
secure
information
that
would
be
used
in
the
prosecution--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
happens
quite
frequently,
and
i
believe
it
is
the
duty
of
those
lawyers
when
they
see
evidence
that
a
crime
has
occurred
to
turn
it
over
to
the
prosecuting
attorneys--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
would
not
want
to
go
that
far,
but
an
argument
could
be
made
to
that
effect.
but,
it
certainly
is
a
common
practice
not
only
for
attorneys
within
the
department
of
justice
but
in
the
agencies
and
departments
to
do
that.
and,
this
court
has
many
times
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
internal
revenue
service
refers
matters
to
the
department
of
justice
for
criminal
prosecution.
it
has
been
a
criterion
used
in
cases
dealing
with
the
enforcement
of
internal
revenue
summonses
which
are
to
be
used
prior
to
these
referrals
and
not
subsequently.
but,
the
discussion
always
assumed
that
it
was
a
proper
function
to
make
the
referrals
to
criminal
prosecution
when
evidence
of
wrong-doing
was
found.
the
fact
is
many
statutes
impose
law
enforcement
duties,
both
criminal
and
civil,
on
attorneys
and
others
for
the
government.
and,
while
i
do
not
wish
to
denigrate
the
concern
that
congress
had
in
the
safeguard
that
it
wanted
to
provide
that
the
grand
jury
not
be
subverted
to
uses
wholly
for
a
civil
purpose.
i
think
the
danger
of
that
can
easily
be
exaggerated.
from
where
i
stand
within
the
government,
the
complaint
that
we
hear
most
of
the
time
from
the
departments
and
agencies
is
that
they
cannot
get
the
u.
s.
attorneys
to
use
the
grand
jury
as
often
as
they
would
like
to
pursue
the
criminal
violations
that
the
departments
and
agencies
think
they
have
uncovered
because
grand
juries
are
time
consuming
and
resources
are
limited
and
the
use
of
the
grand
jury
has
to
be
rationed.
while
we
do
not
in
any
way
advocate
not
observing
the
safeguard
that
congress
intended
in
this
rule,
we
do
not
think
there
is
a
great
danger
that
the
united
states
attorneys
are
subject
to
manipulation
for
use
of
the
grand
jury
for
civil
purposes.
in
most
instances,
they
have
all
they
can
do
to
use
it
for
all
of
the
criminal
cases
that
might
warrant
its
use.
that
is
the
experience
we
are
having
these
days,
at
least.
the
other...
before
we
proceed
to
the
language
and
legislative
history
at
issue
here...
the
other
perspective
that
i
think
is
useful
to
keep
in
mind
is
whether
the
application
that
was
made
by
the
internal
revenue
service
here
poses
any
of
the
dangers
to
the
integrity
and
efficacy
of
the
grand
jury
process
itself
that
this
court
has
observed
from
time
to
time.
we
set
forth
on
pages
31
and
32
of
our
brief,
the
five
standards
of
the
rose
case
that
this
court
twice
approved.
because
the
grand
jury
proceeding
had
been
completed
here
and
particularly
because
it
had
been
concluded
with
a
guilty
plea,
it
is
only
the
fourth
of
these
standards
that
could
possibly
have
any
relevance
here,
the
encouragement
of
free
and
untrammeled
disclosure
by
witnesses,
by
persons
who
have
information
with
respect
to
the
commission
of
crimes,
or
as
the
court
said
in
proctor
&
gamble,
to
encourage
all
witnesses
to
step
forward
and
testify
freely
without
fear
of
retaliation.
there
are
two
possible
impediments
to
look
toward
under
this
criterion.
one
is
whether
the
danger
of
personal
liability
might
discourage
a
witness
from
testifying
freely,
and
that
seems
unlikely
in
this
context
if
a
witness,
even
himself
not
the
target,
were
to
disclose
that
he
was
a
party
to
tax
fraud,
or
engaged
in
tax
fraud
himself.
regardless
of
whether
that
information
could
be
disclosed
to
the
irs
for
civil
purposes,
it
could
possibly
lead
to
criminal
proceedings
against
that
witness
for
tax
fraud.
it
is
hard
to
see
that
there
is
a
substantial
additional
deterrent
placed
on
the
witness
if
he
knows
that
it
might
also
lead
to
an
assessment
of
a
tax
deficiency
against
him
for
collection
purposes.
with
respect
to
the
possible
retaliation
from
employers
or
other
persons
because
the
witness
disclosed
a
wrong-doing
that
he
knew
about,
this
is
something
that
has
already
been
disclosed
in
the
grand
jury
to
attorneys
for
the
government,
and
because
under
6(e)
the
further
disclosure
would
be
under
the
protection
of
a
court
order
and
would
be
requested
by
the
united
states
attorney
himself
who
has
an
interest
in
protecting
witnesses
against
retaliation.
protective
provisions
could
be
included
in
the
court
order.
there
could
be
deletions
made
from
what
is
disclosed.
there
is
because
of
the
participation
of
the
court--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--they
do
not
have
authority
to
go
into
court...
into
the
district
courts.
they
have
to
ask
the
department
of
justice
to
handle
that
for
them.
they
lack
the
statutory
authority
to
do
that.
it
is
not
that
they
would
not
have
authority
under
the
rule.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
could
request
it.
of
course,
the
judge
himself
would
be
aware
of
any
sensitive
material
of
this
sort,
and
the
united
states
attorney
could
participate.
there
are
cases
that
have
held
that
requests
by
administrative
agencies
for
materials
to
be
used
in
an
administrative
hearing
are
not
within
the
coverage
of
6(e).
we
do
not
think
the
correctness
of
those
cases
is
really
at
issue
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
assumed
it
for
purposes
of
argument,
but
i
do
want
to
caution
the
court
that
the
lower
courts
are
by
no
means
unanimous
on
this.
there
is
a
very
recent
decision
by
the
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
oklahoma,
which
i
should
bring
to
the
court's
attention,
united
states
against
robert
sutton,
civil
docket
no.
1069b,
in
the
northern
district
of
oklahoma,
which
upheld
the
propriety
of
a
rule
6(e)
order
giving
the
department
of
energy
materials
from
a
grand
jury
investigation
of
failure
to
observe
price
controls
on
gas
which
would
be
used
in
an
administrative
hearing
in
the
department
of
energy,
and
which
subsequently
have
been
put
to
use
in
a
civil
enforcement
proceeding
by
the
department
of
energy
to
disgorge
the
unlawful
profits
that
were
secured.
but,
that
is
not
a
de
novo
proceeding
of
the
kind
that
you
have
in
a
tax
case
in
the
court.
it
is
a
proceeding
on
the
administrative
record
with
deference
to
the
findings
of
the
agency.
that
is
in
our
view
an
open
question
that
need
not
be
decided
in
this
case.
we
have
here
a
request
for
materials
to
determine
a
tax
deficiency
which
then
would
be
contested
in
either
the
tax
court
or
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
claims
in
a
de
novo
proceeding
in
which
the
findings
would
be
made
judicially--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
unless
the
taxpayer
pays
the
bills.
but,
of
course,
any
case
could
be
settled
even
after
it
is
brought.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
provision
textually
which
speaks
to
preliminarily
to
or
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding.
if
the
preliminarily
to
language
is
to
have
any
independent
meaning
or
use,
there
has
to
be
some
time
prior
to
the
actual
instigation
or
certainty
that
litigation
will
be
instituted,
that
it
will
apply
to.
we
think
that
in
this
context
the
legislative
history
might
clearly
ratify
what
had
been
a
long-standing
practice
under
rule
6(e)
particularly
with
respect
to
disclosure
under
court
order
of
these
materials
to
the
internal
revenue
service
for
their
use
for
determining
tax
deficiencies,
something
that
to
the
best
of
our
ability
to
ascertain
it
has
been
done
hundreds
of
times
every
year
under
rule
6(e)
in
district
courts,
usually
ex
parte
without
any
recorded
decision
and
since
long
before
litigation
about
this
kind
of
thing
became
fashionable
and
there
were
reported
cases.
in
looking
at
the
legislative
history
before--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
do
not
have
it
documented.
it
is
hard
for
us
to
document
it.
we
have
found
forms
in
the
internal
revenue
service
regional
manuals...
forms
indicating
how
6(e)
orders
should
be
applied
for.
we
do
have
in
this
particular
legislative
history,
the
very
thing
i
was
about
to
turn
to,
testimony
before
the
house
committee
which
is
the
only
one
that
held
hearings
that
while
it
doesn't
document
it
completely,
it
does
indicate
that
this
has
been
the
general
practice.
i
think
the
committee
report
takes
on
new
meaning
if
read
in
light
of
this
testimony
which
i
would
like
to
now
turn
to...
testimony
by
judge
becker
of
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania,
who
was
really
the
star
witness
at
these
hearings,
and
i
say
that
advisedly
because
congress
was
not
in
this
instance
satisfied
with
the
draft
of
the
rules
that
the
advisory
committee
had
submitted,
and
instead
rebuilt
its
own
draft
on
the
basis
of
testimony
and
again
and
again
judge
becker's
testimony
was
referred
to.
just
to
give
the
court
a
flavor
of
what
it
was
that
the
committee
was
building
on,
i
would
like
to
read
a
few
paragraphs--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
is
in
the
hearings
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
we
do
not
have
it
reprinted
for
you,
which
is
why
i
want
to
read
it
to
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
am
reading
from
page
36
of
the
printed
report
of
the
house
hearings,
and
this
is
during
judge
becker's
testimony.
he
says,
"i
will
say
this"...
and
this
is
as
close
as
i
can
come
to
answering
justice
stevens
question...
"that
in
my
district
all
of
the
6(e)
orders
or
most
of
the
6(e)
orders
have
been
in
irs
cases.
"
"we
have
them
in
irs
cases
because
the
irs
has
requested
the
6(e)
order
for
its
own
protection.
"
this
has
been
in
order
to
enable
the
irs
attorneys
to
participate
in
assisting
the
u.
s.
attorney
as
well
as
then
submitting
another
request
that
the
materials
be
turned
over,
and
he
gets
to
that
as
i
go
on.
"when
you
are
dealing
with
agency
access.
"
--and
i
am
reading
from
judge
becker
again...
"the
problem
is
not
the
problem
of
later
prosecutions
but
the
problem
of
later
civil
use.
"
"the
agencies
feel
that
if
they
had
a
6(e)
order
they
are
protected
against
claim
of
abuse
in
the
event
they
later
use
the
information
civilly.
"
"in
response
to
a
question
posed
about
the
question
of
later
civil
use,
the
case
law
in
that
area,
which
includes
the
1956
grand
jury
case,
which
mr.
seigel
referred
to,
the
seventh
circuit
case,
and
my
pflaumer
case,
have
made
the
availability
of
later
civil
use
by
the
agency
turn
on
the
question
of
bad
faith
in
pursuing
the
grand
jury
investigation.
"
if
the
court
finds
that
the
grand
jury
was
really
a
subterfuge
to
obtain
this
information
for
the
agency
or
for
civil
use,
then
the
court
has
the
power
to
say
you
cannot
use
it
civilly.
you
cannot
proceed
against
this
individual.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
finds
that
there
was
no
bad
faith,
then
they
can
use
it
civilly.
there
are
investigations
such
as
the
one
mr.
seigel
described
where
they
pursue
a
criminal
tax
investigation
with
the
aid
of
the
irs.
if
the
investigation
was
in
good
faith
or
for
a
valid
criminal
purpose,
and
it
does
not
turn
up
in
the
final
analysis
sufficient
evidence
of
criminality,
i
think
the
prevailing
case
law
is
that
it
can
be
used
civilly
if
there
was
no
bad
faith.
in
light
of
that
and
there
were
repeated
references
to
the
irs
in
his
testimony
and
other
testimony
and
repeated
references
to
his
other
opinion,
the
hawthorne
case
as
well
as
the
pflaumer
case,
he
was
a
witness
because
he
was
the
author
of
two
of
the
more
extensive
opinions
at
the
time.
in
light
of
that,
there
is
added
significance
to
the
portion
of
the
senate
committee
report
based
on
these
same
hearings
because
the
senate
relied
on
these
hearings
and
did
not
conduct
its
own
hearing
that
we
have
reproduced
on
pages
28
and
29
of
our
brief
in
which
they
said
quite
explicitly
there
was
no
intent
to
preclude
the
use
of
grand
jury
developed
evidence
for
civil
law
enforcement
purposes.
on
the
contrary,
there
is
no
reason
why
such
use
is
improper
assuming
that
the
grand
jury
was
utilized
for
the
legitimate
purpose
of
the
criminal
investigation.
and,
then
at
the
conclusion
of
the
paragraph
the
two
cases
cited
are
proctor
&
gamble
and
hawthorne.
the
hawthorne
citation
which
we
have
discussed
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
takes
on
added
significance
in
the
fact
that
judge
becker
repeatedly
referred
to
it.
it
is
his
opinion
and
in
context
it
is
suggestive
that
judge
becker's
views
themselves
were
being
endorsed
including
the
views
that
he
gave
to
the
committee
in
testimony.
and,
the
citation
of
proctor
&
gamble
is
on
pages
683
and
84
which
is
only
the
concluding
paragraph
of
the
opinion.
it
is
not
the
portion
of
the
opinion
that
is
generally
looked
at,
but
it
is
the
portion
that
approves
of
the
civil
use
of
the
grand
jury
materials
in
this
particular
anti-trust
investigation
because
there
was
no
finding
that
the
grand
jury
proceeding
was
used
as
a
short
cut
to
goals
otherwise
barred
and
more
difficult
to
reach.
the
court
was
quite
explicit
in
saying
what
was
occurring
here,
that
the
suit
was
filed
on
the
heels
of
a
grand
jury
investigation
in
which
no
indictment
was
returned.
the
government
is
using
the
grand
jury
transcript
to
prepare
the
civil
case
for
trial,
and
appellees
who
are
defendants
in
that
suit
desire
the
same
privilege.
it
was
denied
to
them
partly
on
the
rationale
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
government's
doing
that
and
that
a
private
party,
and
the
court
was
very
careful
to
limit
its
discussion
to
a
private
party,
has
to
make
a
showing
of
particularized
need
in
those
circumstances
even
though
obviously
the
government
which
needed
the
materials
pretty
much
in
whole
because
the
civil
suit
was
the
mirror
image
of
the
criminal
prosecution
that
aborted--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--they
did
not
specify
what
the
purpose
was.
the
language
was
carried
over
from
the
earlier
draft
of
the
rule,
of
the
1946
draft,
where
it
was
really
designed
for
a
somewhat
different
purpose.
it
was
designed
to
be
a
means
of
bringing
court
supervision
into
the
picture
because
defendants
were
trying
to
interview
grand
jury
members
to
get
information
with
which
to
attack
the
grand
jury's
constitution,
or
what
occurred
before
the
grand
jury.
an
effort
was
made
to
bring
all
of
this
under
court
supervision.
it
was
simply
carried
forward
and
takes
on
whatever
additional
meaning
can
be
found
in
the
context
of
the
policies
being
approved
in
this
committee
report
and
the
response
to
the
testimony
at
the
hearing.
they
did
not
really
state
what
criterion
they
meant
to
use
by
the
words
preliminary
to.
but,
they
did
indicate
that
they
were
knowledgeable
about
the
fact
that
6(e)
orders
had
traditionally
been
used
to
turn
over
materials
to
the
irs
for
tax
assessment
purposes.
there
has
to
be--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--our
position
covers
the
use,
yes,
at
any
stage
of
an
irs
investigation
to
determine--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
would
take
that
position--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--if
there
has
been
a
grand
jury
investigation
conducted
that
is
related
to
tax--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--if
the
grand
jury
materials
are
relevant
to
a
tax
investigation,
then
there
is
a
sufficient
likelihood
that
a
deficiency
will
be
assessed
and
that
litigation
will
ensue
that
the
standard
is
met
as
we
understand
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
always
within
the
discretion
of
one
side
to
a
controversy
to
agree
to
the
position
that
the
other
side
is
taking,
if
the
irs
has
made
a
deficiency
assessment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
that
is
very
similar
to
the
situation
in
proctor
&
gamble
where
this
court
did
distinguish
between
the
particularized
need
a
private
party
must
show
and
the
fact
that
it
was
proper
for
the
government
to
be
using
the
materials
without
any
showing
of
a
particularized
need
to
be
using
the
entire
transcript
for
criminal
law
enforcement
purposes.
and,
in
the
douglas
oil
case
precisely--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--no,
it
would
not,
but
it
permitted
them--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--without
a
court
order,
but
it
did
permit
the
use
by
government
attorneys
for
civil
law
enforcement
purposes
of
the
entire
grand
jury
materials
without
a
showing
of
particularized
need,
and
the
douglas
oil
opinion
very
carefully
referred
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
private
party's
request
that
was
being
considered
there.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
do
think
that
in
the
context
of
showing
of
particularized
need
that
a
private
party
must
make,
the
eminence
of
the
court
proceeding
is
what
enables
the
private
party
to
show
that
the
kind
of
particularized
need
the
court
has
specified
to
impeach
a
witness,
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we,
of
course,
have
taken
the
position
that
it
is
not--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--although
the
question
is
premature
in
this
case.
but,
the
need
that
the
government
has
is
the
mirror
image
for
civil
enforcement
proceedings
of
what
was
needed
to
conduct
the
grand
jury
investigation
of
the
criminal
violation
here
just
as
it
was
in
proctor
&
gamble.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
it
did
approve
the
fact
that
the
government
was
using
the
materials
in
toto
and
said
that
there
was
no
impropriety
there,
therefore,
not
a
basis
for
the
defendant
to
claim
a
right
to
the
same
thing.
