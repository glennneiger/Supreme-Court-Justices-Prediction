chief

e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
baggot.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
it
not
some
times
happened
that
information
from
one
of
the
civil...
one
of
the
non-criminal
divisions
not
secured
by
discovery
but
just
their
own
investigation,
then
might
be
referred
to
the
criminal
division
for
prosecution
when
some
lawyers
in
the
division
make
a
judgment
that
there
is
criminal
conduct
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
a
fact
that
they
might
be
violating
some
federal
statute
if
they
didn't,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
put
our
finger
on
that,
mr.
wallace?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
betar?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
isn't
it
possible
for
any
one
of
us
to
have
a
"tax
liability"
that
we
do
not
even
know
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
almost
unknowable
at
a
certain
stage.
if
you
are
using
the
term,
i
take
it,
in
a
narrow
sense
that
a
liability
which
has
been
at
least
asserted
or
suggested
by
someone.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
agree
that
any
one
of
us
could
have
a
tax
liability
without
knowing
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
the--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--internal
revenue
might
take
a
different
view
of
the
way
we
have
treated
an
item
and
say
that
it
is
not
capital
gain,
it
is
income.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
goes
to
the
meaning...
perhaps
the
meaning
of
this
preliminary
aspect,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
suppose
finally
this
is
referred
to
the
department
of
justice.
it
goes
to
the
tax
division,
maybe
sent
downstairs
to
the
criminal
division...
if
it
is
still
down-stairs...
then
what?
you
mean
the
criminal
division
or
the
tax
division
cannot
use
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
that
stage,
they
may
not
be
sure
whether
there
is
criminal
liability,
but
on
the
hypothesis
justice
marshall
suggested
to
you,
there
surely
is
an
incipient
potential
civil
liability
for
tax
on
the
million
dollars.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
look
at
footnote
18,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
justice
brennan.
