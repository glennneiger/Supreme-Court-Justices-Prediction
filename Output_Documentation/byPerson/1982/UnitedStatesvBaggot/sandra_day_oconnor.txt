mr.
wallace,
under
your
view
what
was
the
purpose
of
congress
putting
in
this
preliminary
to
language
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
wallace,
in
a
sense,
if
particularized
need
has
to
be
established
by
the
government,
we
do
not
know
that,
that
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
other
case,
but
if
it
does,
then
isn't
the
inquiry
about
preliminary
to
judicial
proceedings
part
and
parcel
of
that
same
test,
in
effect.
the
closer
it
is
to
a
judicial
proceeding
or
the
more
involved
it
is
with
it,
the
more
the
particularized
need
has
been
established.
isn't
kind
of
part
of
a
the
same
inquiry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
if
the
government
is
held
to
a
particularized
need
standard
of
some
kind,
the
same
might
be
true.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
so
preliminary
to
means
something
else
otherwise
it
would
not
be
there.
so,
you
have
got
to
back
up
beyond
the
filing
of
a
suit
obviously.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
question
is
at
what
point?
after
the
filing
of
a
deficiency
notice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
pretty
unsatisfactory,
isn't
it,
from
the
standpoint
of
any
effective
administration
of
the
system,
and
you
surely
ought
to
be
able
to
come
in
here
and
suggest
something
better
than
that
to
us.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
it
lies
with
us
in
interpreting
it.
