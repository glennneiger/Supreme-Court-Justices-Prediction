mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
read
with
interest
and
pleasure
the
tribute
to
the
late
justice
fortas
that
was
recently
presented
to
this
court.
solicitor
general
lee
remarked,
that
justice
fortas
warned
that
the
court
should
be
chary
of
overreaching.
he
quoted
justice
fortas
thusly,
"the
courts
may
be
the
principal
guardians
of
the
liberties
of
the
people.
"
"they
are
not
the
chief
administrators
of
its
economic
destiny.
"
the
government
argues
in
its
briefs
that
they
need
this
material
so
they
can
protect
the
public
fist,
the
public
revenue.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
duty
of
irs
to
collect
taxes,
but
there
is
nothing
to
collect
here.
we
are
not
here
to
decide
the
most
efficient
or
the
most
expeditious
way
for
irs
to
collect
those
taxes.
i
think
we
are
here
for
a
very
narrow
purpose
to
decide
whether
under
the
facts
of
baggot
the
government
may
pay
sufficient
showing
to
penetrate
the
historic
rule
of
grand
jury
secrecy.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case
was
balance
the
competing
public
interests,
that
of
grand
jury
secrecy
against
a
civil
tax
examination,
and
they
properly
held
for
grand
jury
secrecy.
the
court
recognized
that
a
liberal
disclosure
policy
would
facilitate
tax
collection,
but
they
decided
that
the
interest
in
grand
jury
secrecy
outweighed
that.
this
case
arose,
your
honors,
from
a
letter
that
was
sent
by
an
irs
civil
examination
head
to
the
united
states
attorney,
and
he
requested
grand
jury
testimony--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--his
name
was--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--he
was
chief
of
the
civil
audit
division
in
chicago,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
well,
no.
that
is
what
i
am
getting
to.
he
requested
these
grand
jury
testimony
and
these
documents
to
determine
whether
there
is
civil
tax
liability.
they
were
going
to
have
an
examination
to
see
if
there
should
be
a
deficiency.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
no,
sir,
he
was
not.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
well,
to
be
honest
with
you,
what
happened
is
the
u.
s.
attorney
choned
this
information
out
of
the
civil
tax
audit
division.
what
had
happened,
your
honor,
was
there
were
three
different
requests
for
disclosure,
all
of
which
were
denied
by
the
court
below.
then
what
happened
is
the
united
states
attorney
transferred
over
to
the
chief
of
the
civil
audit
division
matters
of
public
record.
and,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that.
he
sent
over
the
information,
the
plea
sentencing
transcript,
and
the
day
that
they
took
the
plea.
he,
then,
said,
oh
my
goodness,
it
looks
like
there
might
be
something
here,
and
he
sent
a
letter
back
and
said,
would
you
please
send
us
anything
that
you
might
have
that
would
bear
on
the
civil
tax
liability
of
this
taxpayer.
his
letter
is
appended
to
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
u.
s.
attorney
sent
the
matters
of
public
record
to
him.
they
did
not
have
an
independent
audit
going
against
this
taxpayer.
now,
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
taxpayer,
mr.
baggot,
did
not
plead
to
any
tax-related
violation.
he
plead
to
two
commodity
violations,
and
that
information
is
set
forth
at
page
3a
in
our
appendix.
there
is
no
tax-related
violation,
and
the
solicitor
general
is
wrong
when
he
says
that
there
was.
there
were
two
commodity
violations
for
bid
rigging
or
what
they
call
wash
trades.
now,
one
reason
the
government
does
not
qualify
under
the
preliminary
to
exception
arises
from
the
unique
statutory
provisions
of
irs.
congress
provided
that
irs
has
no
right
or
no
ability
to
initiate
litigation
over
a
civil
tax
liability.
that
right
belongs
exclusively
to
the
taxpayer.
even
if
irs
wanted
to
go
to
court
and
sue
somebody
for
paying
their
taxes,
they
cannot
do
it
by
statute.
the
procedure
arises
thusly.
normally,
not
in
this
case,
an
examination
takes
place
of
a
return,
and
irs
decides
whether
they
may
compute
a
proposed
deficiency.
if
they
decide
there
is
a
proposed
deficiency
a
preliminary
notice
of
that
proposed
deficiency
is
sent
to
the
taxpayer,
and
he
then
has
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
talk
to
that
examiner
and
settle
or
pay,
or
he
can
appeal
within
the
irs
administrative
procedure
to
their
appeals
office.
if
he
is
unsuccessful
there
in
negotiating
and
if
he
does
not
want
to
pay,
irs
then
issues
what
is
called
a
90-day
notice
of
deficiency
and
that
officially
determines
the
amount
of
the
deficiency.
a
letter
goes
out
to
the
taxpayer,
and
it
says,
you
owe
90
days
to
pay
it
or
else.
that
letter
of
deficiency,
that
90-day--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
or
go
to
the
tax
court
because
if
the
taxpayer
decides
not
to
go
to
the
tax
court,
justice
blackmun,
irs
can
go
seize
his
assets.
but,
what
happens
with
that
90-day
letter,
that
notice
of
deficiency,
it
triggers
the
right
of
the
taxpayer
to
initiate
litigation.
he
has
two
choices.
he
can
go
to
the
tax
court
and
ask
them
to
redetermine
that
deficiency,
or
he
can
pay
the
amount
owed,
then
file
a
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
for
a
tax
refund.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
pardon,
sir?
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
yes,
sir.
you
are
right.
i
was
just
talking
about
the
triggering
of
the
litigation.
the
only,
as
i
said,
only
the
taxpayer
has
the
right
to
file
suit
and
that
is
because
irs
does
not
have
any
need
for
litigation.
if
the
taxpayer
does
not
go
to
court,
the
internal
revenue
service
determination
is
final
and
an
assessment
was
made.
now,
the
solicitor
general
wallace
said,
oh,
we
are
here
to
find
out
about
an
assessment.
we
are
a
long
way
of
an
assessment.
we
are
not
any
where
near
an
assessment.
now,
if
the
taxpayer
does
not
pay
what
the
assessment
says,
irs
can
seize
and
sell
his
assets
without
a
court
order.
in
general
motors
leasing,
this
court
said
that
a
tax
assessment
is
given
the
force
of
a
judgment.
now,
here
the
first
step
has
not
been
taken
yet.
there
has
not
been
an
examination.
there
is
no
proposed
deficiency.
there
is
no
notice
of
deficiency,
and
there
is
no
assessment.
all
we
have
is
the
desire,
the
bear,
naked
desire
of
irs
to
see
if
there
is
a
tax
liability.
now,
the
government
motion
here
sought
disclosure
for
use
preliminary
to
or
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding
relating
to
the
tax
liability
of
the
respondent.
there
is
no
tax
liability.
there
is
not
even
a
proposed
tax
liability.
the
seventh
circuit,
i
think,
rightly
held
that
mr.
baggot's
possible
tax
liability
was
too
embryonic,
was
too
speculative,
and
was
too
uncertain--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--i
would
certainly
hope
that
i
would
know
about
mine,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
suppose
that
is
possible
under
certain
interpretations
that
irs
might
make,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
at
least
suggested.
we
do
not
even
have
that,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
as
i
say,
i
suppose
that
is
possible.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
but
that
is
certainly--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
i
understand,
and
i
agree
with
that,
but
that
is
certainly
not
our
situation
here.
at
best
we
have--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
in
that
regard...
now,
there
was
a
dissent
in
this
case
by
judge
pell,
and
i
am
willing
to
accept
the
definitions
that
judge
pell
gave
for
preliminary
to.
he
said,
preceding
the
main
business
or
lying
before,
or
leading
to.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
main
business
of
a
tax
examination
is
the
calculation
of
a
deficiency.
that
is
not
a
judicial
proceeding.
the
calculation
is
an
administrative
function,
and
it
is
not
preparatory
to
a
law
suit.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
first
of
all,
i
would
correct
you
because
when
you
say
continue
to
investigate,
they
have
not
conducted
any
investigation
of
this
taxpayer.
they
first
made
their
request
for
these
materials
in
march
of
1978.
that
is
over
five
years
ago,
your
honor.
and,
they
have
not
yet
conducted
their
own
investigation,
and
i
am
getting
to
their
power.
they
have
enormous
power--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--i
will
get
specifically
to
your
question.
it
is
cited
in
our
brief,
professor
lafave
testified
before
the
house
committee
that
was
considering
the
1977
amendments
to
the
6(e)
rule,
and
the
concern
was
not
as
solicitor
wallace
says,
the
concern
was
if
we
give
administrative
agencies
this
information
for
criminal
purposes
as
they
are
allowed
to
do,
the
concern
was
that
there
would
be
leakage
back
to
those
agencies
so
that
they
would
use
it
for
unrelated
civil
purposes.
when
questioned
about
that,
professor
lafave
said
unless
it
was
a
matter
most
critical
to
their
undertaking
and
unless
they
could
demonstrate
that
they
had
no
other
comparable
way
of
obtaining
this
evidence,
they
could
not
get
to
the
evidence
under
the
preliminary
to
exception.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
is
a
two-prong
test.
number
one,
is
it
preliminarily
to,
which
involves
the
balancing
of
a
competing
interest
among
other
things,
and
the
second
test
is
particularized
need,
which
has
been
set
forth
by
this
court.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
i
do
not
know
if
ever,
your
honor.
that
is
what
i
am
saying.
i
suppose...
i
do
not
want
to
say
that
the
preliminary--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--no,
sir,
but
i
think
at
a
minimum
they
would
have
to
use
their
own
investigative
procedures--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--they
have
done
nothing
in
this
case,
and--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--i
do
not
know
when
that
is,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
when
that
is.
i
don't
think
that
we
can...
i
think
we
can--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--certainly
not
in
this
stage,
and
i
do
not
think--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
perhaps--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--i
would
say
yes.
that
would
be
in
connection
with--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--i
would
not
say
never
because,
i
was
taught
a
long
time
ago
that
that
is
a
bad,
bad
word--
[laughter]
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
not
under
those
facts
alone.
if
they
see
that
in
the
newspaper,
they
can
certainly
start
their
own
internal
revenue
service
investigation.
they
have
massive
powers.
they
have
subpoena
powers--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--if
there
were
grand
jury
minutes
in
that
case,
i
do
not
think
they
could
go
for
them
unless
they
have
shown
that
they
have
used
their
own
powers.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
if
you
are
talking,
your
honor,
about
a
criminal
case,
they
can
have
them.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
but,
you
said
he
plead
guilty
to
embezzlement,
not
to
income
tax
violations.
if
we
are
talking
about
civil
purposes,
the
primary
reason
for
the
grand
jury,
and
it
is
in
the
fifth
amendment,
is
that
it
is
an
accusatory
body
to
bring
criminal
matters,
felony
criminal
matters.
it
is
not
to
be
used
for
civil
matters.
this
court
said
in
proctor
&
gamble,
it
would
be
flouting
the
purpose
of
the
law
if
it
were
used
solely
for
civil
matters.
i
will
go
along
with
justice
white
who
asked
solicitor
general--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--i
understand
that.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
that
is
over
with,
but
they
still
had
no
right
to
those
grand
jury
minutes.
what
they
do
if
they
do
that
is
they
circumscribe
the
intent
of
congress
when
it
is
an
improper
use
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
if
there
is
a
criminal
case,
your
honor,
the
matter
becomes
public
knowledge.
there
is
testimony.
it
is
public
knowledge--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--okay,
and
i
am
suggesting
incipiency
is
not
enough.
i
think
at
a
minimum
you
need
a
controversy,
a
case
or
a
controversy
at
the
administrative
level.
at
the
administrative
level,
under
that
you
really
have
nothing.
in
your
mind
you
know
pretty
well
if
this
guy
only
reported
$2.50,
he
has
got
a
big
tax
liability
if
he
embezzled
a
million.
but,
technically
as
far
as
the
rule
is
concerned,
as
far
as
irs
procedures
are
concerned,
there
is
nothing
determined
until
there
is
a
notice
of
deficiency.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
if
the
work
papers
are
the
direct
product
of
the
grand
jury,
i
would
still
stick
to
my
answer.
no,
sir,
justice
marshall.
if
the
work
papers
are
generated
outside
of
the
grand
jury,
yes,
they
can
get
them.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
yes.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
i
do
not
think
we
can
draw
a
bright-line
test.
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
about
this.
the
easy
answer,
i
think,
is
if
you
file
a
deficiency
notice
that
should
be
a
sufficient
time
for
them
to
come
in
and
say
it
is
preliminary
to.
but,
what
i
think
will
happen
if
this
court
establishes
that
kind
of
test
is
irs
will
run
right
around
end.
and,
they
will
crank
out...
it
will
be
an
open
invitation
for
them
to
crank
out
deficiency
notices
just
like
popcorn.
so,
i
think
what
you
have
to
do
is
take
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
use
the
flexibility
of
the
court.
it
is
a
discretionary
matter...
6(e)
is
a
discretionary
matter.
it
is
not
mandatory,
and
i
think
you
have
to
talk
about
the
tests
that
were
set
forth
in
douglas
oil
and
balance
the
competing
interest
against
the
relevant
circumstances
and
against
the
standards
that
were
set
and
see
if--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
as
i
say,
i
do
not
think
you
can
establish
a
bright-line
test
here.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
i
think
my
answer
lies
with
congress
and
they
way
that
they
set
forth
that
statute.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
no,
i
do
not,
because
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
they
would
not
fashion
a
special
judicial
exception
to
6(e)
for
the
benefit
of
irs.
and,
that
is
what
the
government
is
asking
you
to
do
here.
and,
justice
white
put
his
finger
on
it
in
his
question
earlier.
they
are
not
saying,
well
at
this
point
we
have
established
preliminary
to.
they
are
saying
everything
is
preliminary
to.
they
are
asking
for
automatic
access.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
no,
sir,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
what
congress
said
because
of--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--yes.
what
they
said,
number
one,
it
takes
a
court
order.
number
two,
they
said
they
did
not
want
any
leakage
back.
number
three,
they
said--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--oh,
yes,
you
can.
that
is
what
the
rule
says,
your
honor.
that
is
what
the
rule
says.
you
can
have
disclosure
preliminary
to
or
in
connection
with.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
no,
i
am
saying
that
that
stage
may
be
reached
at
some
critical
stage
within
irs
procedures,
but
i
cannot
define...
but
we
certainly
have
not
reached
it
in
baggot.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
your
honor,
i
am
not
qualified
to
speak
to
the
facts
of
sells.
but,
again,
never
is
a
bad
word.
i
think
if
the
civil
division,
one,
showed
that
it
was
preliminary
to,
and
number
two
showed
a
particularized
need--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--then,
i
do
not
think
that
is
sufficient.
an
investigation
is
not
sufficient.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
you
are
getting
me
into
the
sells
case,
and
i
do
not
know
the
sells
case.
the
only
thing
i
know
about
sells
is
that
if
this
court
accepts
any
lessened
standard
of
particularized
need
that
they
opt
for
in
sells,
i.e.
rationally
related,
and
if
this
court
adopts
the
position
that
they
are
taking
here
and
giving
administrative
agencies
automatic
access
to
grand
jury
materials,
you
signal
the
death
bell
of
the
grand
jury
because
there
would
be
no
more
secrecy
at
all.
secrecy
will
be
gone,
and
the
vital
function
of
the
grand
jury
as
a
criminal
accusatory
body
in
the
criminal
justice
system
will
be
devastated.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--i
think
the
law
will
be
changed.
the
practice
will
change.
fifty
percent
of
the
test
for
disclosure
is
gone.
--the
preliminary
to.
the
judge's
action
below
will
be
purely
ministerial.
they
want
automatic
access.
they
will
render
the--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--i
am
not
sure
what
you
have.
if
you
are
talking
about
what
he
says,
oh,
it
has
been
routine
and
we
have
done
this
all.
your
honor,
that
is
certainly
not
true.
he
talked
about
judge
becker,
and
what
i
suggest
you
do
is
look
at
the
pflaumer
case
and
look
at
the
hawthorne
case,
both
of
which
were
written
by
judge
becker--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--no,
i
did
not
say
judge
becker
was
wrong.
just
hear
me
out,
please.
if
you
remember,
justice
stevens
asked
mr.
wallace
can
you
document
it.
and
he
said,
no
we
cannot.
judge
becker
agonized
over
those
two
decisions.
he
talked
about
how
unclear
6(e)
was.
he
asked
this
court
to
clear
up
the
confusion
created
by
6(e),
and
that
is
what
lead
to
the
1977
amendments.
and
those
1977
amendments
said,
yes,
give
it
to
irs
for
criminal
purposes,
but
when
that
access
is
gone,
it
stays
with
the
u.
s.
attorney
and
they
have
to
come
in
for
an
order
under
the
preliminary
to
or
connection
with
exception
before
they
can
have
any
of
this
material.
that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
the
1977
amendment,
and
there
was
not
any
routine
disclosure
at
all.
the
preliminary
to
rule
has
remained
unchanged
since
it
was
promulgated
in
1946.
mr.
wallace
is
right
when
he
says
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
or
nothing
in
the
advisory
notes
that
gives
you
any
indication
what
congress
thought
about.
all
they
said
in
the
advisory
notes
is
we
intend
to
continue
the
traditional
practice
of
grand
jury
secrecy.
and
i
suggest
to
this
court...
and
they
cited
three
cases,
none
of
which
had
anything
to
do
with
disclosure
to
an
administrative
agency.
and,
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
traditional
practice
of
grand
jury
secrecy
did
not
include
turning
the
stuff
over
to
irs
to
use
for
civil
purposes.
if
it
did,
it
was
changed
by
the
1977
amendment.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
that
is
right.
even
in
judge
becker's--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--your
honor,
even
in
judge
becker's
opinion
in
hawthorne,
which
the
government
relies
on,
he
said
if
the
irs...
and
we
are
talking
about
irs
there...
had
access
for
criminal
purposes,
their
future
access...
those
were
his
words...
would
follow
as
though
there
had
been
no
access
at
all.
that
gets
difficult,
and
the
chief
justice
asked
a
question
earlier.
he
said,
well
how
can
he
take
it
out
of
this
side
of
their
mind
and
put
it
over
in
the
other
side
of
their
mind.
and,
the
quick
answer
is,
they
cannot,
but
i
think
congress
was
trying
to
do
the
best
they
could
to
see
that
they
would
so
there
would
not
be
any
abusive
practices
in
the
grand
jury.
another
thing
i
would
like
to
speak
to
is
he
said
his
experience
is
that
u.
s.
attorneys
cannot
be
manipulated.
i
was
a
federal
prosecutor,
both
with
the
anti-trust
division
and
the
strike
force
for
ten
years,
and
i
have
been
handling
grand
jury
matters
for
another
18
years.
manipulation
is
as
easy
as
an
irs
saying
to
the
united
states
attorney,
subpoena
the
records
from
this
bank.
it
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
title
18
investigation,
but
it
would
certainly
help
the
civil
investigation.
as
a
normal
matter,
a
u.
s.
attorney
could
care
less,
and
i
use
that
very
advisedly,
about
tax
violations.
he
is
interested
in
title
18
violations.
for
example,
let's
take
an
extortion
case,
or
let's
take
a
bribery
case.
his
questions
are
who
did
you
pay,
and
how
much
did
you
pay
him,
and
why
did
you
pay
him.
if
a
witness
knows
that
irs
is
going
to
be
listening
at
the
door
and
get
all
of
those
grand
jury
secrets,
he
is
going
to
be
very
reluctant
to
speak,
and
that
goes
to
the
fourth
reason
for
secrecy,
the
impact
on
the
testimony
of
witnesses
should
be
full
and
frank.
because
he
does
not
have
any
problem
saying
maybe,
or
at
least
he
has
reached
a
point
saying,
alright
i
am
involved
in
a
crime,
and
i
will
tell
you
about
this
bribery.
i
paid
this
public
official.
but,
if
he
thinks
irs
is
going
to
carry
his
house
and
his
car
away,
he
is
going
to
be
very
reluctant
to
talk
about
that.
and,
that
holds
over
to
all
grand
jury
actions
that
involve
money.
what
you
are
doing
is
giving
irs
a
partnership
in
the
grand
jury
proceeding,
and
i
suggest
that
traditional
grand
jury
history
and
secrecy
as
set
forth
by
this
court
in
many,
many
cases,
colandra
and
u.
s.
v.
johnson,
blair,
and
proctor
&
gamble,
and
pittsburgh
plate
glass,
never
contemplated
such
a
thing.
let
me
make
one
more
point.
general
motors
filed
an
amicus
brief
here,
and
if
you
will
look...
i
have
the
page
marked,
but
i
cannot...
there
is
a
long
footnote,
i
think
it
is
page...
it
is
footnote
18.
irs
asked
general
motors
for
all
kinds
of
documents,
and
they
said,
we
will
give
them
to
you.
we
kept
copies.
you
do
not
need
a
6(e)
order.
here
you
are
government--
mr.
samuel
j.
betar,
jr.
--thank
you,
your
honor.
