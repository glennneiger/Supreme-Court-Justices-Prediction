justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
i
notice
the
way
you
put
that.
i
would
suppose
you
would
think
you
could
use
the
grand
jury
for
dual
purposes
as
long
as
you
had
a
bona
fide
criminal
investigation
going
on
that
you
could
conduct
a
parallel
civil
investigation
using
grand
jury
material?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
government's
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
rather
broad
purpose.
there
are
all
sorts
of
stages
that
the
irs
goes
through.
do
you
say
that
your
position
covers
all
of
those
stages?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
in
connection
with
an
audit
of
a
tax
return
they
want
the
material,
they
can
get
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
if
they
have
not
decided
on
an
audit,
if
they
are
just
reviewing...
if
they
are
just
looking
at
a
return,
just
looking
at
a
return,
and
maybe
they
wanted
to
decide
whether
to
do
it
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
anything
the
irs
wants
to
do
is
preliminary
to
litigation,
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
litigation
will
ensue
only
if
the
taxpayer
chooses
to
have
it
ensue?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
not
have...
proctor
would
not
have
permitted
use
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
by
irs
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
a
court
order--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
what
was
his
office?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
in
connection,
then,
with
an
audit?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
he
was
in
the
process
of
auditing?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
deciding
whether
to
audit?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
how
the
matter
ever
got
to
the
chief
of
the
audit
division?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
never...
i
would
not
mind
the
rest
of
the
answer
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
about
when
in
this
process
would
the
government
be
entitled
to
seek
these
materials
because
they
have
reached
a
stage
preliminary
to
litigation?
when
in
a
tax
case
would
the
government
ever
be
entitled
to
these--
justice
byron
r.
white
--would
you
have
to
wait
until
the
taxpayer
sued
them
till
they
knew
that
the
taxpayer
had
brought--
justice
byron
r.
white
--when
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
the
question--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
isn't
late
enough
now
any
way,
it
isn't...
that
stage
has
not
been
reached
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
they
would
never
be
able
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
as
a
preliminary--
justice
byron
r.
white
--with
litigation,
but
there
would
never
be
any
preliminary
to
for
the
irs?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
case
by
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
just
the
reverse.
the
logic
of
your
position
is
just
the
reverse.
until
litigation
actually
occurs,
they
are
never
going
to
get
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
congress
must
have
meant
something
by
preliminary
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
it
is
preliminary
to,
you
cannot
even
get
a
court
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
to
reach
that
stage
before
you
can
even
get
a
court
order.
you
have
to
reach
the
state
of
being
preliminary
to
litigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
your
position
suggests...
the
logic
of
your
position
is
that
you
never
reach
that
stage
in
a
tax
investigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
you
say
you
never
could
define
it
except
on
a
case-to-case
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
do
not
want
to
get
you
mixed
up
on
the
prior
case,
but
if
your
position
is
correct,
and
if
the
government
loses
sells,
the
civil
division
could
never
get
grand
jury
matters
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
to
bring
litigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
the
tax
division,
all
the
civil
division
would
say,
we
are
investigating.
we
do
not
know
whether
we
are
going
to
sue
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
their
own
investigation
aside
from
the
grand
jury
they
would
have
to
have
reached
a
decision
to
litigate.
they
have
not
filed
yet,
and
they
may
just
want
to
confirm.
that
would
be
your
position
in
sells,
i
think.
and
you
would
force
the
government
to
file
suit
against
people
with
less
than
adequate
preparation
perhaps,
which
would
put
people
in
a
worse
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
if
the
government
wins
in
this
case,
the
law
will
have
been
substantially
changed?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
that
practice
will
have
to
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
don't
think
the
testimony
that
your
opponent
referred
to
is
the
least
bit
meaningful
about
the
use
of
grand
jury
minutes
by
agencies?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
mr.
wallace
is
wrong
and
also
judge
becker?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
certainly
have
broadened
your
position
already.
you
are
saying,
then,
that
as
far
as
some
agency
outside
the
department
of
justice
is
concerned,
preliminary
to
litigation
is
utterly
meaningless?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
generally
say,
you
may
not
turn
this
material
over
to
an
agency
for
civil
purposes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
your
position.
well,
that
means
there
is
no
preliminary
to
at
all.
