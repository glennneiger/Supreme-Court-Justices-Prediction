justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
case
is
81-1938,
united
states
v.
baggot.
it's
here
on
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit.
it
involves
the
same
rules
that
were
involved
in
the
sells
case,
disclosure
of
grand
jury
materials
for
civil
uses
is
permitted
by
federal
rule,
and
i
quote
from
the
rule,
"when
so
directed
by
a
court
preliminarily
to
or
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding."
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
an
internal
revenue
service
investigation
to
determine
a
taxpayer's
civil
tax
liability
is
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule
preliminarily
to
or
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding.
and
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
is
not
and
affirmed
the
judgment
of
that
court.
our
reasons
are
detailed
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
the
chief
justice
dissents
and
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
