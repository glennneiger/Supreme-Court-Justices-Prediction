let
me
give
you
a--
--that

not
the
way
you
win
arguments.
there
is
a
man
that
pleads
guilty
to
embezzling
a
million
bucks--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--during
the
calendar
year
of
1981,
and
internal
revenue
looks
at
his
income
and
he
reported
a
gross
income
of
$2.50,
would
that
entitled
irs
to
move
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
could
they
go
for
the
grand
jury
minutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
assume
that
a
man
who
pleads
guilty
to
embezzling
a
million
dollars
that

are
grand
jury
minutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall

i
cannot
imagine
the
man
pleading
guilty
to
anything
but
a
criminal
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
not
solely.
the
man
has
pleaded
guilty.
it
was
used
to
get
him
to
plead
guilty,
so
that
is
the
criminal
part.

is
over
with.
justice
thurgood
marshall

is
over
with.
justice

couldn't
the
irs
get
the
u.s.

work
papers
who
handled
the
case
before
the
grand

it
every
day.
