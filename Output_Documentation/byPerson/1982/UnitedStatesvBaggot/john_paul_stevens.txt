mr.
wallace,
why
do
you
say
that
it
would
always
be
at
the
request
of
the
united
states
attorney?
couldn't
the
irs
go
in
independently
and
ask
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
since
i
have
interrupted
you,
what
about
an
independent
agency,
like
the
federal
trade
commission
or
the
labor
board.
they
cannot
get
any
of
this
material,
can
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
assumed
those
cases
were
correctly
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
the
taxpayer
paid
his
bills.
unless--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
wallace,
can
i
interrupt
you
right
there?
can
you
tell
me
what
the
clearest
written
evidence
of
that
long-standing
practice
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
really...
i
do
not
see
it
documented
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
betar,
you
rather
reluctantly
conceded
that
if
a
law
suit
had
been
filed,
for
instance,
by
the
taxpayer?
then
the
government
could
establish
that
it
was
preliminary
to
the
judicial
proceeding,
but
the
rule
says
that
if
it
is
preliminary
to
or
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding,
certainly
then
it
would
be
in
connection
with?
