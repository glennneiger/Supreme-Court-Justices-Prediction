justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
court
of
appeals
use
that
rather
obscure
phrase
that
you
just
used
that
first
amendment
rights
were
affected
but
not
infringed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
solicitor
general
lee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
congress
instead
of
giving
the
veterans
organizations
a
break
in
the
tax
statute
had
simply
appropriated
$5
million
to
each
of
them?
do
you
think
that
would
be
challengeable
in
court
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
really
isn't
much
different.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
lee,
i
am
not
quite
certain
what
happens
to
an
organization,
a
501(c)(3)
organization,
which
does
lobby.
did
you
say
that
it
actually
lost
its
exemption?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
correct?
i
thought
perhaps
it
just
lost
its
right
to
have
contributions
deductible.
it
actually
loses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
flexibility
for
the
first
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sims,
you
suggested
a
moment
ago
that
there
was
a
distinction
to
be
made
between
lobbying
for
a
private
interest
or
in
the
public
interest.
is
that
done
by
congress
or
by
the
irs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
is
the
common
law
concept
of
inuring
to
the
private
groups
as
opposed
to
the
public
groups.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sims,
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
a
501(c)(3)
organization
lobbying
loses
its
exemption?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
it
then
qualify
for
501(c)(4)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
don't
you
have
the
jurisdictional
problem
that
you
are
basically
arguing
for
relief
as
an
appellee
that
was
different
than
that
granted
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
can
you
think
of
any
case
in
which
this
court
has
granted
someone
a
benefit
under
the
internal
revenue
code
which
congress
didn't
choose
to
grant
them
because
of
an
equal
protection
argument?
