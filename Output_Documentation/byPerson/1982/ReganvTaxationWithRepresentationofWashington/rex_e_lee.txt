mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
has
provided
two
general
types
of
tax
relief,
either
or
both
of
which
may
be
available
to
certain
kinds
of
organizations.
first,
section
501(c)
exempts
the
income
of
about
two
dozen
different
types
of
organizations
from
taxation
on
that
income.
second,
section
170
entitles
the
donors
to
a
smaller
number
of
501(c)
organizations
including
both
veterans
groups
and
also
groups
qualifying
under
501(c)(3)
to
deduct
their
contributions.
one
of
the
qualifications
for
501(c)(3)
status,
and,
therefore,
both
tax
exemption
and
also
donor
contribution
deductibility,
is
that
no
substantial
part
of
the
entity's
activity
consists
of
attempts
to
influence
legislation.
the
proposed
activities
of
the
appellee
which
has
unsuccessfully
sought
recognition
as
a
501(c)(3)
organization
will
consist
principally
of
attempts
to
influence
legislation.
it
attacks
the
constitutionality
of
the
scheme
that
i
just
described
on
two
grounds.
the
first
is
that
withholding
tax
exempt
status
from
501(c)(3)
or
any
other
organizations
which
lobby
is
a
violation
of
a
first
amendment
right.
the
second
is
that
since
congress
has
afforded
tax
exempt
status
to
veterans
organizations
which
lobby
but
not
to
501(c)(3)
organizations
which
lobby,
its
equal
protection
rights
have
been
denied.
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals
unanimously
held,
and
we
agree,
that
the
appellees'
first
amendment
argument
is
foreclosed
by
this
court's
unanimous
holding
in
cammarano
versus
the
united
states
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
congress
to
subsidize
first
amendment
activity.
with
respect
to
equal
protection,
the
court
of
appeals
further
observed,
and
i
am
quoting,
that
"taxation
also
has
a
weak
case
solely
in
terms
of
equal
protection
because
of
congress's
vast
leeway
under
the
constitution
to
classify
the
recipients
of
its
benefits
and
to
favor
some
groups
over
others.
"
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
a
heightened
standard
of
equal
protection
scrutiny
was
applicable
and
that
it
was
infringed
in
this
case
because
first
amendment
rights
were
affected
even
though
they
had
not
been
infringed.
the
court
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
instruction
to
cure
the
unequal
treatment
which
it
found
by
one
of
two
alternatives.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
first
held,
justice
rehnquist,
that
under
cammarano
they
had
not
been
violated.
i
think
that
is
more
my
characterization,
but
i
think
that
is
the
only
fair
way
that
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
can
be
read
because
of
the
effect
upon
first
amendment
rights.
the
court
identified
as
the
most
logical
remedy
option
to
impose
the
lobbying
restriction
on
veterans
organizations
none
of
which
is
a
party
to
this
litigation.
it
also
identified
another
alternative:
judicially
enlarging
the
congressional
list
of
exempt
organizations
to
include
the
501(c)(3)'s
which
the
court
observed,
correctly
in
our
view,
might
open
a
pandora's
box
of
woes
and
abuse.
in
our
view,
the
underpinning
of
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
has
to
be
that
congress
has
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
even
though
there
is
no
direct
infringement
of
a
first
amendment
right
if
government
treats
different
groups
of
people
in
different
ways
and
the
deferential
treatment
comes
to
rest
on
a
first
amendment
or
other
fundamental
right
interest.
that
is
the
combination
of
circumstances
that
brings
the
equal
protection
guarantee
into
play.
whatever
appeal
that
argument
might
have
had,
if
we
were
at
the
dawning
of
its
day
in
court,
i
submit
that
it
comes
too
late
because
it
has
already
been
considered
and
rejected
by
this
court
which
has
held
on
at
least
three
separate
occasions
that
government
subsidization
of
one
group
but
not
another
even
where
the
fundamental
rights
of
the
nonsubsidized
group
will
be
affected
violates
no
constitutional
guarantee.
buckley
versus
valeo,
for
example,
upheld
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
granted
public
funds
to
the
candidates
of
major
parties
but
not
minor
parties.
there
was
clearly
unequal
treatment,
and
there
was
an
arguable
impact
on
first
amendment
values.
similarly,
in
monner
versus
roe
and
harris
versus
mcrae
congressional
statutes
providing
medicaid
funds
for
indigent
live
births
but
prohibiting
such
funds
for
abortions
were
attacked
on
the
same
grounds
advanced
here,
namely,
that
the
impact
of
the
different
treatment
came
to
rest
on
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
of
the
disfavored
group,
namely,
the
right
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
have
an
abortion.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
but
the
difference
of
treatment
in
those
cases
was
undeniable,
and
the
effect
was
on
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
nevertheless,
the
court
held
that
there
was
a
legal
protection
violation
because
there
is
a
basic
difference
between
direct
state
interference
with
a
protective
activity
and
state
encouragement
of
an
alternative
activity
consonant
with
legislative
policy.
now
the
difference
between
those
cases
and
the
instant
case:
in
our
view
there
are
two
that
are
relevant,
and
both
of
them
make
this
case
a
stronger
case
for
constitutionality
than
in
harris
and
in
monner.
the
first
difference
is
that
in
those
cases
the
two
things
that
were
treated
differently
were
mutually
preclusive
competitors.
that
is
to
say,
the
statutorily
preferred
event
which
was
birth
necessarily
precluded
the
constitutionally
protected
abortion
decision
by
the
indigent
person
so
that
to
whatever
extent
funding
encourages
child
birth,
abortion
is
necessarily
inhibited.
here
by
contrast,
subsidizing
veterans
groups
has
no
automatic
detrimental
effect
on
charitable
groups.
the
second
difference,
and
in
my
view
the
more
important
one,
is
that
the
classification
in
this
case
is
part
of
our
national
acts
of
laws.
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
for
equal
protection
purposes,
income
tax
cases
are
in
a
class
by
themselves.
the
internal
revenue
code
is
perhaps
without
peer
in
its
intricacy,
its
detail,
and
its
sheer
length.
by
their
very
nature,
most
income
tax
provisions
classify.
their
function
is
to
identify
under
what
circumstances
the
burden
of
different
groups
in
our
society,
the
share
of
the
national
tax
burden
borne
by
different
groups
is
to
be
either
increased
or
decreased.
in
carrying
out
this
function,
congress
necessarily
treats
different
people
in
different
ways,
and
many
of
those
differences
have
an
arguable
impact
on
a
fundamental
right.
importing
heightened
scrutiny
as
the
test
governing
the
constitutionality
of
that
kind
of
a
complex
and
inner-related
statutory
construct
would
seriously
damage
the
certainty
and
the
predictability
that
should
be
characteristic
of
our
national
tax
laws.
aside
from
everything
else
that
ought
to
go
into
a
fair
tax
system,
it
is
important
that
taxpayers
know
with
as
much
certainty
as
possible
what
their
obligations
are.
that
certainty
value
is
enhanced
by
the
rational
basis
equal
protection
has
because
of
the
likelihood
that
it
ensures
that
the
congressional
judgment
will
in
fact
survive.
it
is
diminished,
correspondingly,
by
a
test
of
heightened
scrutiny.
look
at
the
matter
from
congress's
standpoint.
it
is
probable
that
the
time
will
never
come
when
congress
does
not
have
before
it
some
proposal
for
change
in
the
income
tax
law.
congress's
ability
to
respond
to
new
developments,
new
information,
new
understanding
is
a
difficult
enough
task
under
any
circumstances.
it
should
not
be
rendered
even
more
burdensome
by
increasing
the
likelihood
that
the
judgments
that
congress
makes
will
be
turned
around
by
the
courts.
take
this
case,
for
example:
section
501(c)
consists
of
22
categories.
it
comes
of
no
surprise
to
anyone
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
two
of
those
categories
resulted
in
a
difference
in
treatment
to
their
occupants.
of
course,
there
are
differences
in
treatment.
if
congress
had
not
intended
differences
in
treatment,
there
would
not
be
22
categories.
the
point
is
that
the
entire
code,
and
not
just
these
22
categories,
essentially
consists
of
differences
in
treatment.
that,
i
submit,
is
why
this
court
has
consistently
accorded
great
deference
to
congressional
line
drawing
in
the
income
tax
area.
it
is
repeatedly
stated,
and
most
recently
in
san
antonio
versus
rodriguez,
that
in
taxation,
even
more
than
in
other
fields,
legislatures
possess
the
greatest
freedom
in
classification.
that
brings
me
to
the
final
point.
that
is
whether
the
distinction
between
lobbying
by
veterans
groups
on
the
one
hand
and
lobbying
by
501(c)(3)
organizations
on
the
other
satisfies
this
deferential
standard.
quite
clearly,
it
does.
prior
to
1934
there
were
no
express
statutory
limitations
on
lobbying
by
exempt
organizations.
congress
was
concerned,
however,
in
1934
that
the
deductibility
of
contributions
to
organizations
otherwise
classified
as
religious,
charitable,
or
education
could
effectively
translate
into
the
public
financing
of
private
propagandizing
on
a
range
of
subjects
limited
only
by
the
donor's
whim
and
the
attractiveness
of
that
abuse
increased
with
the
donor's
wealth.
it
was
a
concern
that
was
first
expressed
by
judge
hand
for
a
unanimous
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
1930
in
a
case
called
slee
versus
the
commissioner,
and
as
this
court
observed
in
cammarano,
the
1934
act
made
explicit
the
conclusion
derived
by
judge
hand
in
1930
in
slee.
very
simply,
there
are
differences
between
veterans
organizations
on
the
one
hand
and
501(c)(3)
organizations
on
the
other
that
are
highly
pertinent
to
this
concern
first
expressed
by
judge
hand
in
1930
and
then
ratified
by
congress
in
1934.
in
the
first
place,
there
are
quantitative
differences.
the
number
of
veterans
organizations
is
only
a
fraction
of
the
total
number
of
the
501(c)(3)
groups,
and
the
501(c)(3)'s
collect
about
1500
times
as
much
in
contributions
as
do
the
veterans
groups.
even
more
important,
these
organizations
structurally
by
virtue
of
the
way
they
are
chartered
by
congress
and
in
fact
carry
out
their
operations
do
not
offer
the
opportunities
for
abuse
identified
by
judge
hand
in
1930
and
by
congress
in
1934.
the
veterans
organizations
were--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
do
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
it
is
not
very
much
different.
i
think
this
court
has
made
that
very
clear,
and
it
brings
into
play
another
body
of
doctrine
that
is
also
determinative
in
this
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
precisely.
they
have
been
consistently
upheld.
the
most
recent
that
i
am
aware
of
is
johnson
versus
robison
in
which
this
court
upheld
the
deferential
treatment
insofar
as
veterans'
benefits
were
concerned
to
conscientious
objectors
and
to
those...
the
benefits
went
to
those
who
had
seen
actual
combat
duty,
and
the
challenge
was
by
a
conscientious
objector.
the
point
is,
as
set
forth
in
our
brief,
the
figures
that
have
been
released
by
the
government
demonstrate
that
two
out
of
five
of
every
american
citizen
is
a
beneficiary
in
one
way
or
another
of
veterans'
legislation
which
has
been
passed
by
congress.
just
as
is
the
case
with
the
income
tax
laws,
this
court
has
also
clarified
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
deference
to
which
congress
is
entitled
in
determining
the
benefits
to
which
those
persons
are
entitled
who
have
made
a
great
sacrifice
for
the
benefit
of
this
country,
both
in
terms
of
interrupting
their
civilian
pursuits
and
also
in
terms
of
risking
their
life
and
their
health.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
and
i
plan
to
do
so
right
now.
i
think
it
is
not
at
all
clear
to
me
that
monner
and
harris
would
have
been
decided
in
the
same
way
if
the
consequence
had
been
to
lose
welfare
benefits
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
one
is
i
think
another
principle
that
comes
to
play
is
whether
congress
has
acted
in
such
a
way
as
to
solve
the
problem
that
was
immediately
before
it.
at
least
a
very
strong
argument
could
be
made
that
that
was
simply
sweeping
too
broadly
with
the
revenue.
in
this
instance,
by
contrast,
the
problem
that
congress
has
identified
is
the
problem
of
the
501(c)(3)
with
unidentifiable
size
of
membership
and
type
of
membership
and
the
potential
that
it
offers
for
a
small
number
of
wealthy
individuals
to
have
their
expression
of
public
views,
their
lobbying
if
you
will,
subsidized
by
the
government.
in
this
instance,
congress
has
not
swept
any
more
broadly
than
is
necessary
to
solve
the
particular
problem.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
and
in
slee,
of
course,
the
problem
was
attacked
by
defining
what
is
meant
by
"charitable",
and
what
judge
han
did
in
that
case
was
to
uphold
the
government's
position
that
it
isn't
really
charitable
if
it
is
being
used
for
lobbying
purposes.
now,
what
this
really
does
is
to
make
administratively
more
feasible
to
administer
by
eliminating
the
need
on
a
case-by-case
basis
to
determine
whether
it
is
charitable,
but
in
any
event,
i
think
there
is
this
distinction
in
your
abortion
hypothetical
and
the
case
at...
of
course,
the
other
distinction...
the
other
two
distinctions
are
the
rules
applicable
to
veterans'
cases
and
applicable
to
tax
cases.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
court
of
appeals
in
fact
pointed
that
out,
and
that
is
our
understanding.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
can.
yes,
they
can
set
up
a
separate
501(c)(4).
now,
they
will
tell
you
i
think
in
fairness.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
depends
on
what
the
relationship
is
between
them,
and
that's
the
disadvatage,
justice
blackmun,
as
you
correctly
point
out.
it
is
not
that
clear.
in
the
event
that
there
is
an
attempted
subsidy
by
the
501(c)(3)
group
of
the
501(c)(4),
then,
yes,
that
is
not
permitted,
and
as
a
consequence
that
is
not
a
complete
answer.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right.
i
have
found
that
it
is
less
easy
as
the
court
of
appeals
applied
in
fact.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right.
it
is
demonstrated
by
this
case.
there
was
an
application
made
for
501(c)(3)
status
for
a
determination
under
section
7428
that
this
was
a
501(c)(3)
organization.
it
described
501(c)(3)
status
as
the
status
which
entitles
initially
to
income
tax
exemption,
and
then
section
170
in
turn
keys
into
501(c)(3)
status
in
terms
of
deductibility.
it
was
determined
not
to
be
a
501(c)(3)
entity
because
of
its
lobbying
and,
therefore,
loses
both
the
deductibility
and
also
the
tax
exemption
terms.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
certainly
can
be
interpreted
in
that
way,
justice
o'connor.
we
submit
that
in
that
respect
it
is
susceptible
of
interpretation
either
way.
the
crucial
language
is
that
the
court
on
one
of
these
7428
reviews
may
make
a
declaration
with
respect
to
such
initial
qualification
or
continuing
qualification.
now,
two
points:
one
is
that
an
argued
qualification
is
broad
enough
to
include
the
constitutional
issue,
and
the
second
is
that
particularly
where
you
have
some
ambiguities
which
i
think
we
certainly
have
here
that
it
is
proper
to
look
to
congress's
purpose.
in
this
case,
the
congressional
purpose
was
rather
clear.
it
was
to
undo
the
inequity
that
resulted
as
a
result
of
the
decisions
in
bob
jones
versus
simon,
the
1974
decision,
the
companion
case
that
came
down
the
same
day
in
americans
united.
the
only
way
one
of
these
501(c)(3)
or
other
types
of
organizations
could
obtain
a
determination
as
to
whether
they
did
or
did
not
qualify
was
to
either
have
a
refund
suit
in
the
district
or
to
go
into
the
tax
court.
now,
since
the
objective
law
is
to
provide
one
simply
remedy
for
determination
of
501(c)(3)
status
vel
non,
it
would
be
a
bit
anomalous
to
say
that
congress
intended
to
split
those
out
and
require
constitutional
determination
through
the
old
and
more
difficult
process.
for
that
reason,
we
don't
think
that
7824
precludes
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
think
it
helps
us
to
an
extent.
it
certainly
is
not
as
on
point
as
cammarano,
but,
nevertheless,
it
does
show
the
flexibility,
other
things
being
equal,
insofar
as
the
judgment
of
the
policy-making
bodies
is
concerned.
yes,
perry
does
support
us.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
the
ability
of
that
amendment
to
make
accommodation
in
the
light
of
other
policies,
in
this
case
it
enforces
at
least
cammarano's
holding
that
when
you
have
an
arguable
effect
as
you
do
in
this
case
on
a
first
amendment
interest
that
comes
about
because
of
an
income
tax
classification,
that
you
judge
the
case
as
an
income
tax
and
you
defer
to
congress's
judgment
in
that
case.
indeed,
i
know
of
no
instance
in
which
this
court
has
ever
applied
anything
other
than
the
rational-basis
test
in
equal
protection
income
tax
cases.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
do,
justice
stevens.
you
can
argue
that
cammarano
was
distinguishable,
but
i
think
that
the
principle
that
was
established
in
that
case
carries
through
to
congress
can
make
the
decision
as
to
which
kinds
of
first
amendment
activity
it
wants
to
subsidize
and
which
kinds
it
does
not
which
really
brings
it
back
to
an
equal
protection--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
and
it
is
different
from
cammarano
in
that
respect.
my
answer
is
twofold.
the
first
is
that
in
that
instance,
congress
went
no
further
than
it
needed
to
go
in
order
to
cure
the
problem
it
identified.
the
second
is
that
whether
it
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
but
it
is
just
as
true
here
as
it
was
in
buckley
and
in
monner
and
in
mcrae,
and
in
those
last
two
cases
the
court
said,
"it's
not
as
though
the
government
were
saying
you
can't
have
an
abortion.
"
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
true
and
there
is
that
distinction
as
we
have
observed.
as
i
say,
my
answer
to
it
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--so
far
as
i
know,
at
least
in
that
respect,
you
will
be
making
mula
in
this
case,
but
i
submit
to
you
that
the
principle
from
which
that
mula
ought
to
be
made
has
been
declared
by
cammarano,
and
that
is
that
it
is
after
all
a
matter
of
congress's
determining
how
certain
activities
should
be
financed
and
how
valuable
those
activities
are
to
congress,
and
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct
for
reasons
set
forth
in
that
footnote.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
some
questions.
