mr.
john
cary
sims
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
appellee
challenges
the
severe
penalty
which
is
imposed
on
public
charities
if
they
choose
to
engage
in
substantial
lobbying
as
a
means
of
promoting
their
charitable
purposes.
let
me
emphasize
at
this
point
that
the
case
only
involves
public
charities,
that
is,
organizations
under
section
501(c)(3)
which
are
not
private
foundations.
private
foundations
are
groups
that,
as
defined
in
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969
and
the
irs
regulations
implementing
that
statute,
are
groups
where
there
is
not
seen
to
be
enough
accountability
to
the
public
to
assure
that
the
organization
will
act
in
the
same
way
that
it
would
if
it
were
accountable
to
the
public.
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969
virtually
precludes
lobbying
by
private
foundations.
we
think
that
is
important
because
when
the
solicitor
general
was
referring
to
what
he
believes
congress
was
concerned
about
in
putting
into
effect
the
restriction
that
we
are
challenging
here,
he
is
talking
about
the
possibility
that
a
charity
might
really
not
be
acting
for
charitable
purposes
in
particular
circumstances.
it
may
be
that
a
particular
individual
would
be
attempting
to
manipulate
a
charity
or
perhaps
even
set
up
a
charity
in
order
to
serve
private
concerns.
well,
under
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969
congress
has
already
defined
the
group
of
organizations
where
there
could
be
a
legitimate
concern
that
there
is
not
enough
public
accountability,
and
congress
has
acted
independently,
and
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
another
point
that
i
think
is
worth
making
with
regard
to
the
risk
that
a
public
charity
might
lobby
in
order
to
promote
some
private
interest,
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
first
of
all
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
risk
in
that
regard,
lobbying
isn't
any
different
than
any
other
activities
that
a
charity
might
engage
in.
that
is,
i
suppose
one
could
say
that
there
is
some
risk
that
a
charity
might
engage
in
litigation
or
pamphleting
or
publishing
of
educational
books
in
order
to
promote
some
private
interest,
so
the
argument
made
by
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
really
hone
in
specifically
on
the
lobbying
issue.
as
we
have
emphasized
in
our
brief,
there
are
also
a
number
of
independent
restrictions
that
aren't
challenged
in
this
case
that
would
prevent
a
public
charity
from
using
its
resources
for
lobbying
or
for
any
other
activity
on
behalf
of
private
interests.
under
the
irs
regulations
in
order
to
qualify
in
the
first
place
for
501(c)(3)
exemptions,
you
have
to
be
operating
for
the
public
good
rather
than
for
a
private
good.
mr.
john
cary
sims
your
honor,
if
congress
were
to
pass
that
alternative
statute,
that
would
deal
with
our
argument
about
the
disproportionate
penalty.
to
the
extent
that
there
was
a
penalty
on
lobbying
that
was
tied
in
amount
to
the
amount
of
excessing
lobbying
beyond
whatever
congress
said
was
appropriate,
the
disproportionate
aspect
of
the
current
penalty
would
be
eliminated.
we
don't
believe
that
would
make
the
statute
constitutional
because
you
are
still
left
with
the
core
question
that
comes
up
in
any
first
amendment
case
which
is
first
of
all
what
is
the
congressional
interest
that
is
being
promoted
by
the
restriction,
and
secondly,
has
congress
in
developing
the
particulars
of
the
restriction
done
it
in
as
narrow
and
as
minimally
restrictive
a
way
as
possible.
mr.
john
cary
sims
that's
part
of
section
501(c)(3),
your
honor,
in
that
no
group
can
qualify
under
501(c)(3)
if
there
is
going
to
be
any
inurement
for
the
benefit
of
a
private
individual.
in
addition,
the
statute
itself
says
that
any
charity
has
to
be
organized
and
operated
exclusively
for
exempt
purposes.
mr.
john
cary
sims
it
is
a
common
law
concept
that
has
been
incorporated
in
the
statute,
and
that
is
also
reflected
in
the
regulations,
so
to
the
extent
that
one
can
discuss
a
concern
about
the
possibility
that
lobbying
might
be
directed
to
a
private
end,
that
is
already
dealt
with
in
a
number
of
other
ways
in
the
statute
and
in
the
regulations
and,
as
you
have
indicated,
in
the
common
law
of
charities
and
trusts.
mr.
john
cary
sims
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
john
cary
sims
a
private
foundation
is--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
such
a--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--your
honor,
the
terminology
that
we
have
been
using
in
our
brief
and
that
i
have
been
trying
to
use
today
is
public
charity
which
is
not
a
statutory
term
of
art,
but
it
is
a
term
that
is
used
often
to
refer
to
charities,
that
is,
501(c)(3)
groups,
which
are
not
private
foundations.
private
foundations
are
independently
defined
in
section
509
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
point
i
was
making
in
this
regard
is
that
to
the
extent
that
it
said
that
additional
restriction
on
lobbying
is
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
charities
from
engaging
in
activities
improperly
on
behalf
of
private
interests,
that
concern
is
already
dealt
with
in
other
provisions
in
the
code,
specifically,
the
no-inurement
provision
in
section
501(c)(3),
and
also
the
operated-and-organized-exclusively-for-exempt-purposes
provision
of
the
code.
mr.
john
cary
sims
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
john
cary
sims
i'm
not
sure.
i
suspect
it's
probably
a
private
foundation.
mr.
john
cary
sims
a
private
foundation
is
defined
in
section
509
in
terms
of
the
sources
of
income,
so--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--well,
a
private
foundation
under
section
509
is
a
subcategory
of
section
501(c)(3)
charities.
mr.
john
cary
sims
no,
because
the
sources
of
revenue
for
that
particular
subcategory
of
charitable
organizations
comes
primarily
from
a
small
number
of
sources
rather
than
from
the
general
public,
so
in
enacting
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969,
congress
indicated
that
there
wasn't
the
same
discipline
of
public
support
for
those
groups
that
there
is
for
public
charities,
but
this
case
only
involved
public
charities.
mr.
john
cary
sims
involving--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--well,
the
distinction
is
only
relevant
to
the
extent
that
it
addresses
the
concern
expressed
about
the
diversion
of
charitable
resources
to
private
benefits.
it
is
relevant
in
that
regard.
as
this
court
has
noted
in
the
bob
jones
case,
the
denial
of
a
tax
exemption
under
section
501(c)(3)
can
have
disastrous
consequences
for
a
charity.
it
means
in
effect
that
many
contributors
simply
will
not
make
contributions
to
the
organization,
and
it
may
very
well
jeopardize
the
organization's
ability
to
exist.
mr.
john
cary
sims
first
of
all,
an
organization
is
permitted
to
lobby
up
to
the
level
of
substantiality
under
section
501(c)(3).
if
an
organization
has
already
qualified
under
501(c)(3)
and
it
lobbies
to
an
excessive
amount,
it
does
lose
its
exemption
altogether.
mr.
john
cary
sims
it
could
up
until
the
tax
reform
act
of
1976.
one
of
the
changes
that
was
made
in
1976
was
to
provide...
it
created
this
election
mechanism
under
section
501(h),
and
the
statute
also
said
that
if
an
organization
is
eligible
to
elect
under
section
501(h),
and
all
charities
under
501(c)(3)
are
eligible
to
elect
except
churches
and
except
private
foundations,
so
any
other
public
charity
could.
if
you
are
eligible
to
elect
under
501(h),
then
if
you
lose
your
501(c)(3)
status
because
of
excessive
lobbying,
then
you
can't
qualify
for
(c)(4)
status.
that
was
a
change
that
was
made
in
1976.
the
solicitor
general
in
referring
to
the
appellee
organization
said
that
the
organization
would
primarily
engage
in
lobbying.
we
would
like
to
clarify
that
in
two
respects.
first
of
all,
all
of
the
activities
engaged
in
by
taxation
must
be
directed
to
charitable
ends.
we
think
that
the
distinction
between
lobbying
as
a
mean
and
lobbying
as
some
ultimate
end
is
one
that
is
reflected
at
a
number
of
places
in
the
government's
brief.
we
never
have
argued
that
lobbying,
per
se,
is
a
charitable
purpose.
we
emphasize
that
under
the
law
of
trust
and
under
the
common
law
and
under
the
irs
regulations,
lobbying
is
a
proper
means
of
promoting
a
charitable
purpose.
the
reason
that
taxation
couldn't
qualify
for
section
501(c)(3)
tax
exemption
in
this
case
is
because
it
couldn't
say
ahead
of
time
that
it
would
not
engage
in
substantial
lobbying.
we
have
not
indicated
that
lobbying
is
going
to
be
the
only
activity
carried
on
by
the
organization,
and,
in
fact,
the
exemption
application
which
is
in
the
record
in
the
case
indicates
that
there
are
a
number
of
other
litigational
and
educational
activities
that
will
be
carried
on
by
the
organization,
but
lobbying
engaged
in
by
taxation
will
be
exclusively
a
means
of
promoting
a
charitable
end.
to
the
extent
that
the
solicitor
general
relies
on
slee
for
the
proposition
that
lobbying
is
not
a
proper
purpose
for
promoting
a
charitable
end
and
that
somehow
the
use
of
that
means
rather
than
some
other
means
of
promoting
a
charitable
purpose
renders
the
purpose
uncharitable,
we
suggest
that
even
if
slee
were
properly
decided
in
1930,
and
that
may
be
a
close
question,
certainly
the
law
since
then
has
developed
very
strongly
in
the
direction
that
lobbying
is
a
proper
means
of
promoting
a
charitable
purpose.
the
restatement
of
trust
says
it.
all
the
standard
treatises
on
trust
state
it,
and
in
fact,
the
irs
regulations
say
that
charitable,
which
is
the
umbrella
term
which
is
used
in
the
regulations,
in
section
501(c)(3)
is
used
in
its
generally-accepted
legal
sense.
in
fact,
in
permitting
charities
to
lobby
up
to
the
level
of
substantiality,
congress
has
implicitly
recognized
that
lobbying
is
a
proper
means
of
promoting
a
charitable
purpose.
the
government
relies
very
heavily
on
three
cases.
cammarano,
obviously,
is
the
bedrock
for
the
government's
position,
and
then
there
are
the
three
more
recent
cases
of
buckley,
mayer,
and
harris.
i'll
speak
briefly
about
cammarano
which
has
already
been
discussed
at
some
length
in
the
exchanges
between
the
solicitor
general
and
the
court.
we
do
want
to
emphasize
that
the
penalty
that
is
imposed
on
a
charity
which
engaged
in
substantial
lobbying
is
totally
disproportionate
to
the
amount
of
lobbying
that
is
engaged
in,
and
that
makes
a
big
difference
in
comparing
this
case
to
cammarano.
in
cammarano
there
was
a
complete
correspondence
between
the
amount
of
the
lobbying
activity
engaged
in
by
the
taxpayer
and
the
tax
consequences.
the
taxpayer
simply
couldn't
deduct
the
amount
of
money
that
was
spent
on
lobbying.
in
the
case
of
a
charitable
group
under
section
501(c)(3)
the
group
loses
its
right
to
receive
any
tax
deductible
contributions.
as
i
mentioned
before,
if
it
has
been
an
electing
organization
or
eligible
to
elect
under
501(h),
you
can't
even
qualify
for
a
501(c)(4).
mr.
john
cary
sims
your
honor,
we
are
challenging
both.
we
are
challenging
the
restriction
itself,
and
the
more
particular
issue
before
the
court
is
the
disparity
in
treatment
between
veterans
groups
and
charities.
mr.
john
cary
sims
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
issue
is
here.
we
out
of
caution
filed
a
cross
appeal
raising
specifically
the
first
amendment
issue.
the
court
hasn't
acted
on
that.
we
believe
that
because
this
is
an
appeal
under
section
1252
though,
the
whole
case
comes
up
to
this
court,
and
the
court
has
indicated
that
in
the
past
although
it
hasn't
specifically
addressed
this
issue.
we
certainly
think
that
the
issue
is
before
the
court
if
the
court
chooses
to
grant
review.
mr.
john
cary
sims
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
john
cary
sims
we
believe...
i
think
there
is
something
to
the
government's
argument
that
the
relief
would
be
different,
and
if
it
weren't
a
1252
case.
if
it
were
a
more
conventional
case,
i
think
we
might
have
had
difficulty
because
if
we
prevail
on
the
first
amendment
issue,
we
would
get
relief
that
would
be
broader
than
the
relief
we
got
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
cary
sims
on
cammarano,
we
do
think
that
the
penalty
issue
is
very
important,
that
there
is
not
the
correspondence
here
that
there
was
in
the
cammarano
case.
secondly,
of
course,
this
case
does
have
the
equal
protection
issue.
the
specific
hold
in
cammarano
was
that
a
non-discriminatory,
even-handed
denial
of
deductibility
did
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
of
course,
we
don't
have
a
non-discriminatory,
even-handed
across-the-board
denial
of
tax
benefits
based
on
lobbying.
we
have
a
situation
in
which
certain
groups...
the
veterans
organizations...
are
allowed
to
lobby
without
limitation
in
support
of
their
charitable
purposes,
and
the
501(c)(3)
groups
must
choose
between
the
tax
benefits
of
the
statute
and
their
freedom
to
engage
in
lobbying
as
a
means
of
promoting
their
charitable
purposes.
mr.
john
cary
sims
no,
your
honor.
we
have
never
claimed
that.
in
fact,
we
wouldn't
claim
that--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--the
problem
is
not
the
favorable
treatment.
the
problem
is
that
the
favorable
treatment
is
specifically
directed
to
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights,
and--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--your
honor,
we
don't
believe
that
there
could
be
more
favorable
treatment
of
that
sort
unless
it
can
meet
the
first
amendment
standard
of
review.
that
is
unless
the
congressional
purpose
in
providing
the
preferred
treatment
is
compelling
and
unless
the
restriction
is
crafted
in
such
a
way
that
there
is
a
minimal
restriction
on
first
amendment
rights.
buckley
may
be
a
good
example
in
that
respect.
i
think
that
nobody
can
question
the
court's...
the
logic
of
the
buckley
decision
when
it
says
that
there
can't
be
a
requirement
that
anybody
who
wants
to
run
for
president
gets
$20
million.
the
court
pointed
out
that
would
encourage
a
multiplicity
of
parties,
frivolous
candidacies,
and
in
effect
it
would
undermine
the
very
purposes
for
the
statutory
benefit
scheme
which
was
to
change
the
way
that
elections
were
financed
for
the
good,
not
to
create
greater
chaos.
in
buckley
the
distinction
that
was
made
between
existing
party,
the
new
party,
was
integral
to
the
system
of
public
financing
of
elections,
but
if
there
had
been
a
statute
that
said
that
the
republicans
or
the
democrats
could
get
funding,
but
the
other
major
party
can't,
that
would
have
been
suspect
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
we
think
that
is
essentially
what
is
involved
here.
it
is
discrimination
among
charities
based
on
their
identities.
it
is
specifically
directed
to
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights,
and
it
is
not
directed
to
the
legitimate
objectives
that
congress
certainly
can
implement
if
it
chooses
to
do
so
to,
for
example,
provide
various
other
sorts
of
benefits
to
veterans:
their
educational
benefits,
re-employment
benefits,
medical
benefits,
and
lots
of
others.
there
is
no
problem
in
providing
those
in
recognition
of
veterans'
service
to
the
country.
mr.
john
cary
sims
it
wouldn't,
your
honor,
and
we
don't
think
that
is
the
appropriate
relief.
judge
mikva--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--that's
right.
it
would
not
solve
the
equal
protection
argument
that
we
are
making,
but
it
would
solve
the
equal
protection
disparity.
as
we
have
noted
in
our
brief,
we
are
not
aware
of
any
situation
in
which
this
court
has
found
an
equal
protection
violation
and
then
remedied
by
saying,
"we
will
take
something
away
from
the
parties
that
aren't
before
the
court
rather
than
giving
something
to
the
party
who
is.
"
that
in
some
cases
involved
very
substantial
drains
on
the
federal
treasury.
for
example,
when
you
have
got
a
social
security
case
in
which
widows
can
get
a
certain
benefit
and
widowers
can't
and
there
is
a
challenge
to
it,
and
it
is
determined
that
that
is
an
equal
protection
violation,
if
you
are
going
to
provide
benefits
to
everyone,
that
means
additional
money
is
drawn
out
from
the
treasury.
nonetheless,
this
court
in
those
cases
where
an
equal
protection
violation
is
found
has
uniformly
extended
the
benefit.
mr.
john
cary
sims
no,
and
in
fact
no
one
does
so
far
as
i
know.
the
veterans
groups
obviously
don't
prefer
the
remedy
suggested
by
judge
mikva.
mr.
john
cary
sims
yes,
your
honor,
so
that
everything
that
i
said
before
with
regard
to
the
first
amendment
issue
would
be
equally
applicable
to
this
except
to
the
extent
that
i
think
this
court
has
in
the
past
sometimes
regarded
a
remedy--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--yes.
the
two
questions
were
the
first
amendment
issue
and
the
remedy
issue,
but
i
think
this
court
in
the
past
has
sometimes
reached
the
remedy
issue
in
an
equal
protection
case
as
an
integral
part
of
the
whole
case
without
necessarily
granting
review
independently.
the
other
thing
we
would
emphasize
in
that
regard
is
this
case
does
involve
first
amendment
rights,
and
in,
for
example,
the
picketing
cases,
i
don't
think
it
has
ever
been
seriously
suggested
that
if
there
is
an
equal
protection
violation
because
some
people
can
picket
at
a
particular
location
and
other
people
can't
that
the
proper
solution
is
to
prevent
everyone
from
picketing.
mr.
john
cary
sims
i'm
not
aware
of
any
tax
case
that
does
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
cary
sims
i'm
glad
to
hear
about
it.
[laughter]
justice
rehnquist,
i
am
reminded
that
although
it
is
not
a
federal
tax
case,
the
spizer
case
did
involve
a
tax
benefit
that
had
been
denied.
mr.
john
cary
sims
that's
right.
it
was
a
state
case,
so
it
is
not
directly
on
point,
but
it
may
be
analogous.
mr.
john
cary
sims
well,
we
think
that
the
right
way
to
cure
it
would
be
to
pass
a
statute
that
if
there
are
particular
abuses
that
are
concerned
relating
to
lobbying
such
as
improper
lobbying
for
private
purposes,
that
the
statute--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
in
this
case--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--well,
we
are
relying
on
both.
i
think
that
both
of
those
arguments
help
us.
if
you
take
the
penalty
argument
out
with
regard
to
the
abortion
cases,
the
abortion
cases
still
involve
a
situation
where
the
courts
found
that
there
are
two
competing
interests
each
of
which
was
valid.
there
was
the
interest
in
preserving
the
life
of
the
fetus,
and
there
was
the
freedom
of
the
potential
mother
to
have
an
abortion.
the
court
found...
at
one
point
i
think
the
court
said
in
harris
against
mcrae
that
in
applying
the
equal
protection
analysis
that
an
abortion
is
not
like
any
other
medical
procedure.
it
cannot
be
compared
because
the
interest
of
preserving
life
is
involved.
in
this
case,
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
is
involved
is
among
speakers
and
among--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--i
haven't
developed
a
specific
one.
i'm
sure
it
could
be
done.
i'm
sure
it
could,
but
i
don't
think
anybody
in
this
litigation
has
put
forward
a
specific
proposal.
mr.
john
cary
sims
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
cary
sims
no,
our
argument
is
that
the
government--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--well,
i
think
justice
stevens
is
asking
whether
a
remedy
could
be
developed
that
would
prevent
subsidy
of
lobbying
but
still
allow
deductibility
for
other
charitable
activities.
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
we
believe
that
the
question
is
not
whether
congress
has
to
subsidize
lobbying
but
whether
congress
having
chosen
to
allow
these
tax
benefits
to
charitable
groups
which
are
engaging
in
socially
beneficial
activities
and
to
allow
those
groups
to
litigate
and
to
publish
books
and
to
carry
on--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--the
congress,
if
it
is
going
to
single
out
that
category
of
first
amendment
activity--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--yes,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
john
cary
sims
unless
congress
could
explain
in
a
way
that
would
meet
this
court's
first
amendment--
mr.
john
cary
sims
--well,
the
tax
reform
act
of
1969
shows
that
when
congress
does
what
to
specifically
address
an
identified
problem
it
can
do
it,
and
that's
exactly
what
it
did
with
regard
to
the
perceived
abuses
and
activities
by
private
foundations.
mr.
john
cary
sims
no,
your
honor.
that
certainly
is
right,
but
i
also
i
believe
qualified
that
by
saying
that
when
the
discrimination
involves
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights,
congress
has
to
meet
the
very
stringent
requirements
that
are
applicable
when
first
amendment
rights
are
regulated,
that
is,
congress
has
to
explain
why
some
groups
are
being
given
enhanced
first
amendment
rights
and
others
aren't,
and
it
has
to
show
that
the
restriction
has
been
developed
to
minimally
intrude
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
john
cary
sims
yes,
your
honor.
the
blind,
the
lame,
and
their
representatives
are
the
very
people
that
are
being
denied
their
right
to
lobby
in
pursuit
of
their
charitable
interests,
so
we
have
an
amicus
brief
which
has
been
filed
in
this
case
by
almost
two
dozen
charitable
groups
of
just
the
sort
you
have
referred
to:
the
red
cross,
the
american
heart
association,
and
the
girl
scouts.
mr.
john
cary
sims
no,
all
their
activities
are
limited
by
the
same
statute
that
limits
taxation's
activities.
like
taxation,
like
all
501(c)(3)
groups,
they
are
limited
to
carrying
out
charitable
purposes
under
section
501(c)(3),
and
they
are
all
limited
with
regard
to
the
extent
that
they
can
use
one
particular
means,
lobbying,
in
order
to
accomplish
their
charitable
purposes.
in
the
amicus
brief,
those
charities
have
indicated
that
that
restriction
prevents
them
from
carrying
our
their
activities
in
support
of
the
sick
and
the
injured
and
the
needy,
and
that
they
could
do
those
jobs
better
if
they
could
lobby.
in
fact,
they
have
indicated
that
in
some
cases
lobbying
may
be
the
only
way
to
accomplish
a
charitable
goal,
such
as,
for
example,
the
mental
health
association
mentions
that
in
many
places
there
are
archaic
statutes
that
are
on
the
books
regarding
the
mentally
handicapped
or
the
mentally
ill,
and
it
is
only
by
working
for
a
revision
of
those
statutes
at
the
local
or
the
state
or
the
national
level
that
they
can
accomplish
their
purposes.
we
don't
think
that
there
is
any
basis
for
saying
that
there
is
an
inconsistency
between
lobbying
and
the
proper
charitable
purposes
that
501(c)(3)
organizations
promote.
