chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
regan
against
taxation
with
representation
of
washington.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
not
the
congress
over
a
period
of
years
granted
a
great
many
benefits
to
veterans?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sims?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
sims,
that
irs
could
make
an
evaluation
in
each
case
of
each
exempt
taxpayer
and
say,
"you
are
33
and
a
third
percent
over
the
line
here,
so
we
will
cut
off
33
and
a
third
percent
of
your
exemption?
"
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
congress
cannot
distinguish
between
an
organization
formed
let
us
say
to
help
the
handicapped
and
others
of
that
kind
where
there
is
a
great
deal
of
public
activity
in
the
area
that
these
activities
supplemented?
are
you
saying
that
congress
can't
distinguish
and
have
a
more
generous
attitude
toward
the
foundation
or
the
exempt
taxpayer
assisting
the
handicapped,
the
blind,
the
hard
of
hearing,
crippled?
is
it
absolutely
uniform
across
the
board?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
has
an
enormous
respect
for
the
veterans.
you
are
saying
that
the
veterans
are
being
treated
more
favorably
than
others;
therefore,
it
must
fall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
addressing
that.
more
favorable
treatment
with
respect
to
lobbying
which
everyone
has
the
right
to
do
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
have
already
conceded
i
thought
in
discussion
that
congress
can
favor
some
entities
like
the
veterans,
the
handicapped,
over
others.
did
i
misunderstand
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
blind
and
the
veterans
engage
in
lobbying,
it
is
to
advance
a
broad
public
interest
that
has
been
recognized
in
other
settings
by
congress,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
don't
have
a
case
before
the
court
for
us
to
make
an
evaluation
of
their
problem,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
