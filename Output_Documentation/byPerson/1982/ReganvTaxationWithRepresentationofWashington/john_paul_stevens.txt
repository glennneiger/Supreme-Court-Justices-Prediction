justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
go
back
for
a
moment
to
your
comment
that
there
are
only
two
differences
between
the
abortion
cases,
the
funding
case,
and
this
case?
do
you
think
the
abortion
cases
would
have
been
decided
in
the
same
way
if
the
people
on
welfare
who
wanted
abortions
not
only
didn't
have
them
financed
by
the
government
but
if
they
had
an
abortion
they
then
lost
their
welfare
benefits?
here,
as
i
understand
it,
the
501(c)(3)
organization
loses
its
exemption
if
it
engages
in
lobbying.
this
is
the
same
question
that
i
raised
that
you
haven't
yet
answered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose
you
say
they
are
wealthy
persons
because
they
are
rich
enough
to
contribute
to
a
charity,
but
by
hypothesis,
i
suppose,
the
lobbying
is
for
a
charitable
purpose
which
the
government
recognizes
is
in
the
general
public
interest,
or
otherwise
they
wouldn't
give
them
the
tax
exemption
in
the
first
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
forgetting
for
the
moment
the
equal
protection
phase
of
the
case
because
i
think
part
of
your
position
that
all
charitable
organizations
are
not
fungible,
veterans
are
different
from--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
your
first
amendment
argument
is
equally
strong
regardless
of
the
character
of
the
organization?
say
it
is
aid
to
the
blind
or
something,
and
you
are
a
group
which
just
tries
to
promote
legislation
which
will
help
the
group.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
have
acknowledge,
i
think,
that
there
is
more
than
subsidy
at
issue.
it
isn't
just
deducting
the
portion
of
the
income
that
is
spent
on
lobbying.
it
has
required
them
to
lose
their
entire
exemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
here
in
effect,
my
aid
to
the
blind
organization
is
losing
a
very
valuable
exemption
because
it
engages
in
a
protected
activity.
that's
all
it
does.
i
assume
that
the
lobbying
is
a
protected
activity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
in
none
of
those
cases
did
the
claimant
lose
anything.
he
just
wasn't
allowed
to
finance
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
other
case
in
which
merely
because
a
party
engaged
in
an
activity
protected
by
the
first
amendment
that
the
government
was
allowed
to
take
something
away
from
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sims,
supposing
the
cure
to
the
problem
you
are
now
addressing
was
to
just
say,
"okay,
we
won't
let
the
veterans
lobby
either
without
losing.
"
what
good
would
that
do
your
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
remove
the
illegality
which
you
are
now
purporting
to
describe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
a
california--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--while
we
are
talking
about
remedy,
may
i
ask
you
what
you
would
suggest
is
the
proper...
if
we
put
to
one
side
for
a
moment
the
equal
protection
problem
and
just
concentrate
on
the
first
amendment
and
your
argument
that
there
is
a
penalty
here,
how
do
you
cure
that?
i
can
understand
curing
it
on
the
cammarano
facts
where
you
just
allow
a
deduction
for
the
amount
expended,
but
how
can
you
get
partially
qualified
as
a
501(c)(3)
organization?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
that
congress
decides
that
60
percent
of
your
revenue
is
spent
on
lobbying
and
they
don't
want
to
subsidize
the
lobbying
portion
of
your
work.
under
the
abortion
cases
would
you
agree
they
could
do
that
if
they
could
figure
out
administratively
a
way
just
to
avoid
financing
the
lobby?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
you
really
are
not
relying
on
the
penalty
aspect
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
question
is
on
the
assumption
that
we
are
not
troubled
with...
we
say
we
agree
with
the
government
that
veterans
are
different
from
aid
to
the
blind
because
taking
away
their
exemption
won't
really
help
you,
and
we
are
just
concerned
with
your
first
amendment
issue
on
its
own
bottom.
is
there
any
way
to
remedy
the
problem
insofar
as
we
might
see
a
defect
in
the
scheme
because
it
penalizes
you
whenever
you
engage
in
substantial
lobbying
by
taking
away
your
entire
exemption?
is
there
any
remedy
that
would
be
addressed
to
that
alleged
defect
in
the
scheme?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
must
to
that
extent
be
subsidized.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
see
the
problem,
but
we
can't
figure
out
administratively
any
way
to
avoid
the...
we
have
the
two
extremes.
we
have
either
got
to
take
your
exemption
away
completely,
or
we
have
got
to
subsidize
the
lobbying.
we
don't
want
to
do
the
latter,
so
as
a
practical
matter
we
have
adopted
the
only
feasible
solution,
and
you
haven't
suggested
that
there
is
a
feasible
solution
in-between.
