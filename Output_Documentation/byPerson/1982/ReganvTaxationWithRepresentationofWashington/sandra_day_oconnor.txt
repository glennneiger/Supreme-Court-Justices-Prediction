justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
general
lee,
i
suppose
the
appellee
can
set
up
a
separate
corporation
to
do
its
lobbying
and
preserve
the
501(c)(3)
status
for
everything
else.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
lee,
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
argued
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
under
section
7428
to
make
a
constitutional
attack
on
the
validity
of
tax
statutes.
i
know
that
in
a
footnote
in
your
reply
brief
you
indicated
disagreement,
but
it
seemed
that
was
worth
a
comment
at
least
because
that
statute
seems
to
be
set
out
to
provide
only
review
by
the
commissioner
of
administrative
matters,
not
to
raise
constitutional
issues.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
one
other
question
if
i
may.
do
you
think
that
this
court's
recent
holding
in
perry
education
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
