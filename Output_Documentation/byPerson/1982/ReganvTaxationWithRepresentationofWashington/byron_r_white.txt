justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
you
stand
by
your...
i
think
it
is
in
your
reply
brief...
you
suggest
that
the
first
amendment
issue
isn't
here
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
properly
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
issue
like
this
in
the
cases
as
far
as
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
distinction.
i
didn't
hear
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
really
challenging
on
first
amendment
grounds
the
whole
lobbying
qualification
in
501(c)(3).
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
do
you
think
there
is
any
merit
in
the
suggestion
that
the
first
amendment
issue
is
not
properly
here
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
your
qualification
to
argue
it
as
an
appellee?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
had
never
filed
a
cross
appeal.
would
you
still
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
--all
right.
thanks.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
defend
the
court
of
appeals'
result
in
this
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
with
respect
to
your
cross
appeal.
did
you
raise
that
in
your
cross
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
sound
like
your
position
is
that
the
government
must
subsidize
the
lobbying?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
to
be
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
limited
relief
besides
that
could
you
have?
how
could
the
government,
as
justice
stevens
asked,
meet
your
objection
without
subsidizing
lobbying?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
must
keep
the
exemption
going
for
people
who
lobby
for
charitable
purposes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
yes,
they
do.
so
your
position
is
that
lobbying
must
be
allowed
by
charitable
organizations
without
losing
the
exemption.
that's
your
position.
