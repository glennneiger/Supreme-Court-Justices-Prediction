justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
they
get
in
this
case,
mr.
cohen?
i
read
the
fifth
circuit's,
or
rather
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
to
say
that
the
board
hadn't
considered
any
first
amendment
argument
in
this
case
and
the
fifth
circuit
will
refuse
to
consider
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
still
not
satisfied
as
to
why
the
first
amendment
issue
is
in
this
case.
i
mean,
we're
not
reviewing
the
pet
case
here,
are
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
board
didn't
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
address
any
first
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why...
i
don't
see
how
the
first
amendment
is
in
the
case.
the
first
amendment
is
not
in
the
case,
obviously,
unless
the
court
feels
there
is
a
need
to
address
that
issue
as
one
of
the
arguments
the
board
has
raised
on
why
the
interpretation
we
have
given
is
an
impermissible
interpretation.
perhaps
i
should
ask
my
questions
to
board
counsel.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
strike
you
as
a
very
faithful
application
of
the
language
of
the
proviso?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
we
would
know
what
congress
was
seeking
to
accomplish
by
the
proviso
by
the
language
it
chose
in
enacting
a
proviso.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that
was
a
wholesaler/retailer.
that
was
nothing
like
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
the
board
didn't
make
any
finding
of
fact
on
the
issue
of
coercion,
did
it?
i
mean,
how
do
we
know
there's
none?
you
say
they
didn't
address
this--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
strikes
me,
mr.
come,
that
your
first
amendment
argument
that
you
made
a
moment
ago
was
framed
in
terms
of
the
difference
between
coercion
and
non-coercion
which
really
goes
to
the
coercive
section
of
the
proviso
and
not
to
the
producer
section.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
good.
mr.
cohen,
the
board,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
didn't
make
a
finding,
did
it?
