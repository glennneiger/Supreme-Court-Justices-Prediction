mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
union
here
had
a
primary
dispute
with
high
construction
company
over
the
payment
of
allegedly
substandard
wages
and
fringe
benefits
to
construction
employees.
when
wilson's
contracted
with
high
to
build
its
store
at
the
east
lake
mall
in
tampa
owned
by
petitioner
debartolo,
the
union
passed
out
handbills
at
the
mall
appealing
to
the
public
not
to
shop
at
the
mall.
the
handbills
are
set
out
at
page
84-a
of
the
joint
appendix.
i
won't
read
it
all,
but,
in
essence,
what
the
handbills
pointed
out
was
that
the
wilson's
department
store
was
under
construction
on
these
premises
and
was
being
built
by
contractors
who
had
paid
substandard
wages
and
fringe
benefits.
it
explained
that
in
the
past,
the
mall's
owner,
debartolo,
had
insured
that
the
mall
and
its
stores
were
built
by
contractors
who
did
pay
fair
wages
and
fringe
benefits,
and
that
the
mall
owner
had
departed
from
that
requirement
in
the
lease
that
it
gave
to
wilson's.
and
the
handbill
ended
up
by
asking
the
public
in
view
of
the
fact
that
wilson's
was
being
built
with
allegedly
unfair
work
standards,
not
to
patronize
the
stores
in
the
mall
until
the
mall's
owner
publicly
promises
that
all
construction
at
the
mall
will
be
done
using
contractors
who
pay
their
employees
fair
wages
and
fringe
benefits.
and
added
that,
however,
if
you
must
enter
the
mall
to
do
business,
please
express
to
the
store
managers
your
concern
over
substandard
wages
and
your
support
of
our
efforts.
now
the
board
did
not
decide
whether
this
handbilling
constituted
restraint
and
coercion
within
the
meaning
of
the
operative
part
of
8(b)(4)ii(b)
because
it
found
that
it
was
protected
by
the
publicity
proviso
to
the
section
which
excludes
publicity
other
than
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
fruitfully
advising
the
public
that
a
product
or
products
are
produced
by
an
employer
with
whom
a
labor
organization
has
a
primary
dispute
and
are
distributed
by
another
employer
as
long
as
such
publicity
does
not
have
an
effect
of
stopping
deliveries,
and
there
were
no
such
work
stoppages
here.
now
in
servette,
decided
19
years
ago,
this
court,
noting
that
the
publicity
proviso
was
the
outgrowth
of
a
profound
senate
concern
that
the
union's
freedom
to
appeal
to
the
public
for
support
be
adequately
safeguarded,
rejected
a
narrow
reading
of
the
producer/distributor
language
and
sustained
the
board's
holding
in
lohman
that
the
terms
as
used
in
the
proviso
cannot
be
applied
in
a
narrow
literal
manner
but
must
be
applied
in
a
manner
so
as
to
effectuate
congress's
concern
in
putting
in
the
proviso
which
was,
as
i
will
outline
in
a
moment,
a
concern
that
a
ban
on
such
publicity
would
present
a
first
amendment
problem
as
congress
understood
the
cases
under
the
first
amendment
and
the
labor
area
in
1959.
now
we
submit
that
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
proviso
in
this
case
is
faithful
to
the
principles
of
servette
and
to
the
legislative
intent.
now
let
me
just
briefly
outline
what
was
before
congress
in
1959.
as
the
court
may
recall,
the
landrum-griffin
bill
passed
by
the
house
which
embodied
the
eisenhower
administration's
proposals
as
to
secondary
boycotts
was
chiefly
concerned
with
closing
three
loopholes
that
were
perceived
in
8(b)(4)
as
it
then
existed.
direct
inducement
of
a
supervisor
or
secondary
employer
by
a
threat
of
labor
trouble
was
not
covered.
appeals
to
individual
employees
were
not
covered.
nor
was
inducement
of
employees
of
non-statutory
employers.
there
was
no
one
in
the
congress
that
thought
that
the
amendments
that
were
proposed
would
cover
consumer
boycotts
until
late
in
the
debates
on
the
bill.
in
august
of
'59,
president
eisenhower
delivered
a
radio
address
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
any
new
reform
legislation
should
include
a
provision
that
banned
consumer
picketing
by
a
union
at
a
retail
establishment.
on
august
20,
following
the
appointment
of
the
house
and
the
senate
conferees
to
work
out
a
compromise
on
two
versions
of
the
proposed
legislation,
senator
kennedy,
who
was
to
preside
at
the
conference
and
representative
thompson,
who
was
one
of
the
conferees,
issued
an
analysis
of
the
landrum-griffin
bill
which
had
by
then
passed
the
house,
and
criticized
it
in
two
respects
that
are
relevant
to
this
case.
the
first
was
that
the
house
bill
would
prevent
the
union
that
had
a
dispute
with
an
employer
such
as
coors
beer
from
picketing
a
restaurant
with
signs
asking
the
public
not
to
buy
the
product.
and
the
second
concern
was
that
the
prohibition
of
the
house
bill
reach
not
only
picketing,
but
leaflets,
radio
broadcasts,
and
newspaper
advertisements,
thereby
interfering
with
freedom
of
speech.
now,
as
this
court
held
in
tree
fruits,
the
first
concern
that
picketing
that
just
followed
the
struck
product
would
be
prohibited
by
the
landrum-griffin
bill
was
taken
care
of
when
they,
the
conferees,
agreed
that
that
would
not
come
even
within
the
restraints
and
coerce
language
in
8(b)(4)ii
at
all.
that
the
only
picketing
that
would
be
covered
would
be
picketing
that
cut
off
the
neutrals'
total
business.
and
as
this
court
later
held
in
safco,
in
some
circumstances
where
his
business
was
only
one
product
even
following
that
product
by
picketing
would
be--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well
the
product
is
the
wilson's
store.
even
the
petitioner
concedes
that.
it
is
not
a
physical
product
in
the
normal
sense,
but
on
the
other
hand
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
servette
there
was
no
intention
that
congress
intended
the
proviso
to
be
any
narrower
than
the
prohibition
to
which
it
was
attached.
and
unless
you
interpret
product
so
that
it
can
include
things
other
than
physical
products,
whole
industries
would
be
not
included
within
the
scope
of
the
proviso.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
and
the
board
found,
and
we
submit
reasonably
so
on
this
record,
that
in
view
of
the
interrelationships
between
the
tenants
at
the
mall
and
wilson's
that
were
created
by
the
lease
arrangements
that
the
debartolo
set
up
here,
that
in
an
economic
sense
all
of
the
tenants...
were,
together
with
wilson's,
distributing
the
fruits
of
highs'
labor
in
the
wilson's
store.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
does,
your
honor,
when
it
is
recognized
that
what
congress
was
seeking
to
accomplish
by
the
proviso.
and
anything
that--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--the
language
is
certainly
the
starting
point,
however,
but
this
court
has
recognized,
and
most
particularly,
in
servette,
that--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--but
nonetheless
the
argument
was
that
producer
meant
only
the
manufacturer,
and
the
principle
that
sustained
a
broader
interpretation,
that
is,
the
board's
lohman
decision
which
was
being
reviewed
in
servette
in
which
the
board
first
enunciated
the
principle
here,
that
a
producer
is,
in
order
to
effectuate
the
purpose
of
the
proviso,
is
anyone
who
adds
value
to
a
product
in
an
economic
sense.
now
in...
as
i
say,
even
petitioner
here
concedes,
or
acknowledges,
that
the
wilson's
store
here
is
a
product
that
was
created
by
high's
and
is
being
distributed
by
wilson's.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
does
not
concede
it's
what...
by
the
other
retailers,
but--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
is
correct.
and
i've
attempted
to
explain
why
the
board
did
so
in
this
case
in
order
to
give
effect
to
the
congressional
intention
in
adopting
the
proviso.
the
reason
that
the
proviso
was
put
in
there,
again
returning
to
senator
kennedy,
was
as
he
explained,
"we
were
not
able
to
persuade
the
house
conferees
to
permit
picketing
in
front
of
that
secondary
shop
but
we
were
able
to
persuade
them
to
agree
that
the
union
shall
be
free
to
conduct
informational
activity
short
of
picketing.
"
in
other
words,
the
union
can
hand
out
handbills
at
the
shop
and
place
advertisements
in
newspapers
and
make
announcements
over
the
radio
and
can
carry
on
all
publicity
short
of
having
ambulatory
picketing
in
front
of
a
secondary
site.
now
as
i
indicated,
shortly
after
the
'59
amendments
were
enacted,
and
for
more
than
two
decades
since,
the
board
has
applied
the
proviso
in
the
light
cast
by
this
legislative
history
and
its
basic
purpose.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
think
the...
i
think
the
key
is
whether
you
have
a
person
that
is
contributing
something
of
value
to
a
product
which
in
turn
is
distributed
in
an
economic
sense
by
the
persons
who
are
being
handbilled.
now
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
board
found
such
a
relationship
in
the
fact
that
the
petitioner,
debartolo,
here
is
the
owner
of
the
land
on
which
high,
the
primary
employer,
was
constructing
this
store,
using
labor
the
union
contended
did
not
measure
up
to
area
standards.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
it
is
a
big
stream
in
order
to--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--i
think
we'd
have
to--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
it
were
found
that
the
proviso
would
not
protect
that
then
i
think
that
the
court
would
have
to
face
a
very
substantial
constitutional
question
that
the--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well
i--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
i
certainly
know
of
no
such
case
that
the
board
has
had.
but
let
me
talk
about
the
first
amendment,
not
because
it
is
in
this
case,
but
because
the
board,
over
the
twenty
years
that
the
proviso
has
been
in
the
act,
has
been
conscious
of
the
same
thing
that
congress
was
concerned
of
when
it
put
the
proviso
in,
namely--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
technically
that
is
correct.
however,
i
should
point
out
that
in
some
of
the
earlier
cases
the
board
has
assumed
that
it
would
be
restraint
and
coercion
unless
it
were
saved
by
the
proviso.
but
in
this
case
the
board
did
not
decide
that
issue
because
it
followed
the
position
that
it
has
consistently
taken,
that
even
if
it
were,
it's
taken
out
by
the
proviso.
now
the
first
amendment
issue
is
a
very
substantial
one.
even
petitioner
concedes
that
the
first
amendment
would
give
the
union
a
right
to
hand
out
these
handbills
that
merely
describe
the
nature
of
the
dispute.
and
the
thing
that
in
their
view--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well...
but
on
this
record
there
is
no
suggestion
of
that.
the
only
coercion
is
in
the
handing
out
of
the
handbills.
but--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--but...
well,
that
may
be.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
this
was
a
stipulated
record,
your
honor.
there
are
no
facts
other
than
the
stipulation.
the
stipulation
shows
that
nothing
went
on
here
but
the
handing
out
of
these
handbills
which
described
the
facts
of
the
labor
dispute
and
added,
don't
patronize
the
mall
stores
if
you
agree
with
the
case
that
we're
setting
forth
here.
now
it
is
well
established
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
indeed
the
court
emphasized
that,
in
claiborne
hardware
only
last
term,
in
quoting
from
an
opinion
by
justice
rutledge
in
thomas
against
collins
that
the
protection
afforded
by
the
first
amendment
extends
to
more
than
abstract
discussion
unrelated
to
action.
free
trade
and
ideas
means
free
trade
and
the
opportunity
to
persuade
the
action,
not
merely
to
describe
facts.
and
so
therefore,
the
mere
fact
that
the
union
added
to
its
message
a
request
that
the
consumers
not
patronize
the
mall,
does
not
make
the
speech
or
the
message
coercive
so
as
to
the
private
of
its
first
amendment
protection,
so
that
if
the
board's
construction
of
the
proviso
in
this
case--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
that
may
well
be.
it
may
be
that
the
board
has
made
its
work
difficult
for
itself
by
not
saying
that
this
is
not
restraint
and
coercion
to
begin
with.
it's
not
in
the
statute
and
as
with
product
picketing
in
tree
fruits--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--if
it
were
not
restraint
and
coercion.
the
board--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
the
other
way
of
avoiding
the
constitution
is
to
interpret...
is
to
sustain
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
proviso
as
taking
this
kind...
as
saving
this
sort
of
activity
from
the
ban
of
8(b)(4)(b).
this
is
the
way
the
loop
that
the
board
has
followed--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
may
be,
if
legislation
were
drafted
in
an
ideal
sort
of
way,
as
your
honor
i'm
sure
is
aware
is
not
the
case.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
when
it
became
apparent
that
picketing,
at
least
certain
forms
of
consumer
picketing,
were
covered
by
the
restraint
and
coercion
part
of
8(b)(4)(b),
the
senate
conferees
thought
that
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
it
was
necessary
to
add
the
proviso
to
make
doubly
sure
that
this
sort
of
publicity
short
of
picketing
would
not
be
a
violation
of
8(b)(4)(b).
and
that
is
the
way
the
board
has
read
the
legislative
history
and
has
thus
interpreted
the
proviso.
so
the
point
that
i
want
to
get
at
is,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
court
reject
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
unless
there's
a
clear
indication
that
congress
intended
to
cover
this
type
of
publicity,
and
we
submit
that,
if
anything,
there's
a
clear
indication
that
it
did
not.
prudential
considerations
that
this
court
has
long
followed
would
dictate
that
it
should
avoid
the...
the
difficult
constitutional
problem
that
would
be
presented
by
sustaining
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
norton
j.
come
at
least
in
the
particular
type
of
relationship
that
you
had
at
this
mall,
that
this
is
different
from
the
stores
on
a
block
that
the
petitioner
is
positing.
you
do
not
have
the
kind
of
interlocking
leasing
arrangements
and
a
joining
together
for
mutual
benefit
that
you
have
here
where
the--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--if
you
had
the
same
sort
of
leasing
arrangements
that
you
had
here
where
the
rent
that
the
tenants
paid
to
debartolo
went
up
depending
upon
the
sales,
and
that
recognition
of
the
fact
that
bringing
in
a
store
of
wilson's
was
a
particular
magnet
because
that
factor
increased
the
rents
of
all
of
the
tenants
by
ten
percent.
and
where
there
is
a--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--not
for
picketing,
not
for
picketing,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
which,
if
it
were
prohibited,
i
submit,
would
present
a
substantial
constitutional
question
because
what
the
court
would
have
to
decide
is
whether
the
first
amendment
permits
a
constitutional
prohibition
directed
solely
to
a
message
that
is
communicated
to
members
of
the
public
that
elicits
no
unlawful
response
on
their
part
because
there's
nothing
unlawful
about
asking
consumers
to
withhold
patronage.
and
it
effects
a
secondary
employer
only
if
members
of
the
public
who
are
not
subject
to
any
union
discipline
or
control
are
persuaded
of
the
merits
of
the
union's
case.
i
submit
that
the
prudential
considerations
the
i
alluded
to
should
prompt
the
court
to
avoid
this
question
and
sustain
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
statute
in
this
case.
