john
paul
stevens
but,
who's
the
victim
of
the
coercing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pardon
me,
the
tenant
stores?
justice
john
paul
stevens
normally
when
you
coerce
someone...
if
you're
coercing
the
tenant
store,
you're
trying
to
get
the
tenant
store
to
do
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
what
do
you
want
to
tenant
store
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
why
it
doesn't
seem
like
coercion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
this
is
not
a
normal
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
forbid
it
if
it's
coercion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
how
can
it
be
coercion
if
you
put
the
pressure
on
somebody
who's
totally
unable
to
do
anything
relevant
to
the
controversy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
in
that
connection
if
they
had
right
outside
the
entrance
to
the
mall
a
soundtrack
that
recited
the
exact
language
of
the
handbill,
would
that
be
objectionable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then
what
other
means
of
communication
do
they
have
to
convey
this
particular
message?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
how
could
they
convey
this
message
to
the
audience
they
want
to
reach--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--namely
people
who
would
like
to
shop
at
the
mall?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
really
not
suggesting
that
there's
an
alternative
means
of
communication.
you're
saying
the
content
of
this
communication
is
something
that's
unprotected
by--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
pressure
is
entirely
in
the
message.
you
don't
do
anything
else--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well
there's
some
dispute
about
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
even
suggest
that
there's
some
dispute
about
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
before
you
get
into
your
first
amendment
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
true
that,
assume
we
disagreed
with
you
on
the
proviso,
you
said
they
have
not
yet
decided
whether
it's
restraint,
coercion
and
so
forth.
and
i
guess
it's
not
only
that
it
has
got
to
be
restraint
and
coercion,
but
it's
also
within
the
meaning
of
be...
forcing
or
requiring
somebody
to
cease
doing
business.
and
would
it
not
be
correct
that
we
would
first
have
to
send
it
back
to
the
board
to
decide
whether
those
elements
of
a
violation
were
present
before
we
have
to
worry
about
any
constitutional
question?
i
know
the
court
hasn't
decided
it,
but
how
do
we
get
to
the
constitution
before
we
know
whether
there's
a
statutory
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
come,
let
me
interrupt
you
again.
you're
assuming
that
giving
out
the
handbills...
that
that's
all
they
did,
but
if
they
actually
coerced
somebody
and
threatened
them,
and
perhaps
implicitly
were
suggesting
violence
if
they
do
some
purchasing
it's
an
entirely
different
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
maybe
there's
no
coercion.
that's
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you,
which
is
the
strongest
case
among
those...
closest
case
among
those
you've
sited
to
this
one
on
the
proposition,
just
coercion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
lohman,
i
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand
there
are
a
lot
of
them.
i
was
just
wonder
which
one
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--just
the
handbilling,
though,
all
of
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
it
involves
a
question
under
the
labor
laws
concerning
picketing
in
a
shopping
center.
a
union
that
was
--
represented
employees
that
were
working
under
construction
of
a
new
store
were
engaged
in
labor
dispute
with
the
owner
of
the
store
to
be
built.
and
in
order
to
explain
this
to
the
public,
they
did
some
handbilling
at
the
shopping
center
and
urged
the
numbers
to
the
public
not
to
patronize
any
stores
in
the
shopping
center
and
the
owner
of
the
shopping
center
brought
a
--
filed
a
charge
with
the
labor
board
claiming
this
was
an
unlawful
secondary
boycott.
the
case
presents
three
questions
whether
the
statute
itself
is
violated
and
if
there
is
a
violation,
is
the
violation
excused
because
the
picketing
comes
within
what
is
known
as
the
publicity
proviso,
and
thirdly,
would
it
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
even
if
it
violated
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
publicity
proviso
protected
picketing
and
we
have
reviewed
that
portion
of
the
case
and
decided
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
that
the
publicity
proviso
is
not
a
protection
and
therefore,
we
remanded
the
case
for
consideration
of
the
other
two
issues
and
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
