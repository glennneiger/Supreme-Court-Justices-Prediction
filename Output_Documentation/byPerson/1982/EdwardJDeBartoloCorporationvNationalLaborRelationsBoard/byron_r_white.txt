what
is
coercively
handbilling?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
--who
is
it
coercing?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
they,
instead
of
using
that
language,
they
had
carefully
explained
everything
that
was
going
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
why...
their
bottom
line
would
have
been,
please
do
not...
please
do
not
patronize
this
shopping
center.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
their
bottom
line
is
still...
their
aim
is
to
get
people
out
of
the
shopping
center.
and
they
just
don't...
they
just
explain
why.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
say
we
have
a
dispute
with
high
and
here's
why
and
therefore
do
not
shop
in
this
shopping
center.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
store
is
the
product
produced
by
the
construction
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
know
he...
he
concedes
this
being
distributed
by
wilson's?
he
doesn't
concede
this
as
being
distributed
by
the
other
retailers
in
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
have
to...
you
have
to
get
over
that
hurtle,
don't
you?
and
the
board
certainly
did.
they
thought
it
was
being
distributed
by
all
the
retailers.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
come,
the
proviso
is
sort
of
downstream
proviso,
isn't
it?
it's
to
people
who
are
distributing
a
product.
you
couldn't
go
around...
you
couldn't
under
this
proviso
picket
the
people
who
supply...
who
supply
the
elements
to
build
a
building.
you
couldn't
go
upstream
under
this
proviso,
could
you?
and
why
do
you
think
debartolo
or
any
of
the
other
tenants
are
downstream?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
only
runs
one
way,
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
to
have
a
new
proviso,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
you
concede,
though,
don't
you,
that
the
proviso
wouldn't
cover
picketing
suppliers.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
maybe
the
first
amendment
might
protect
it,
but
certainly
the
proviso
wouldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
if...
i
take
it
you...
there
wouldn't
be
any
violation
of
8(b)
if
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--exactly.
and
if
that's
a
good
statutory
answer,
i
don't
know
why
we
have
to
deal
with
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
still
have
to
find...
we
still
have
to
agree
that
there's
some...
some
merit
at
least
in
the
holding
that
debartolo
and
all
the
other
stores
were
distributing
a
product
of
an
employer
with
whom
the
union
had
a
dispute.
and
you
do
it
on
the
basis
that...
the
theory
that
a
rising
tide
raises
all
the
boats
i
guess,
the...
everybody
helps
everybody
else
in
this
store...
in
this
shopping
center.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
even
if...
even
if
there
are
three
competing
department
stores,
all
nosed
in
nose
to
nose
competition,
in
this
shopping
center,
the
union
can
picket
the
mall
on
the
grounds
that
they're
all
feeding
off
of
one
another.
add
three...
for
the
three
supermarkets,
grocery
supermarkets
and
a
few
other
multiples.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
thereby
subjected
them
to
picketing.
justice
byron
r.
white
thereby
subjected
them
to
handbilling.
