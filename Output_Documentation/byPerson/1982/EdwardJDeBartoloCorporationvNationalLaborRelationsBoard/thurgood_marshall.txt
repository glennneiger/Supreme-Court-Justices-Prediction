let
me
put
it
this
way,
can
you
make
your
argument
without
using
the
word
coercion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
agree
with
justice
stevens,
you're
coerced...
if
you're
coerced,
you're
coerced
for
the
purpose
of
making
you
do
something.
that's
the
only
way
you
can
be
coerced.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
both
of
you
agree
that
coerce
means
something
that
we
don't,
at
least
that
i
don't
understand.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
could
be
a
law.
it
could
be
destructive.
it
could
be
unbelievable.
it
could
be
insane,
but
is
it
"coercive"?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
right,
i
see--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
suppose
the
union
mailed
the
leaflets.
that
wouldn't
violate
the
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said,
mail
the
exact
same
leaflet
to
the
customers
of
that
store.
that
would
violate...
that
would
be
prohibited.
