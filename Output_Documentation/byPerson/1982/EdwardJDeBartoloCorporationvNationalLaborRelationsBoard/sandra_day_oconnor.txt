but
i--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
it
arguable
that
the
tenant
stores
could
put
pressure
on
the
mall
owner
to
include
contractual
requirements
that
any
tenant
store
that's
building
has
to
pay
union
wages
or
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
argue
for
some
unity
of
interest
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
isn't
spelled
out
or
defined.
and
i
don't
know
exactly
how
that
would
apply
or
what
you
really
have
in
mind.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
who
would
that
leave
out?
give
me
some
example
as
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--okay.
but
how
about
other
examples,
because
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
such
a
test,
we'd
have
to
be
concerned
about
other
examples.
what
if
the
construction
were
up
in
new
york
city
at
a
bloomingdale's
store,
could
you
handbill
the
bloomingdale's
store
in
washington?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
under
your
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
argument
of
the
board
is
that
every
major
tenant
in
the
mall
adds
value
in
effect
to
every
other
tenant
because
you're
bringing
more
people
into
the
mall.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
they
all
want
people
to
come
to
the
mall.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
under
your
theory
even
an
ad
in
the
newspaper
would
be
invalid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
come,
in
your
view,
what
is
important
in
interpreting
the
language
of
in
some
manner
distributed.
is
it
the
ability
of
the
secondary
employer
to
bring
economic
leverage
to
bear
on
the
labor
dispute
or
what?
what's
the
key?
where
would
you
draw
the
line?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
they
handbill
the
suppliers
to
the
mall
stores?
