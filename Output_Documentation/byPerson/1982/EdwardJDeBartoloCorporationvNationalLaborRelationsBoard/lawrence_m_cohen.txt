mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1959
the
congress
amended
the
national
labor
relations
act.
they
had
two
objectives.
one
fundamental
purpose
was
to
strike
from
the
prohibitions
against
secondary
boycotts,
close
loopholes
it
had
developed
under
the
prior
act,
to
preclude,
as
this
court
indicated
in
tree
fruits,
coercion
whether
by
picketing
or
otherwise,
of
a
secondary
employer
to
force
him
to
cease
doing
business
with
the
primary
employer
with
whom
a
union
had
a
labor
dispute.
at
the
same
time,
however,
congress
also
sought
to
ensure
that
unions
could
appeal
to
the
public
for
support.
that
they
could
disseminate
information
about
a
labor
dispute,
and
that
they
could
continue
to
place
pressure
not
only
on
a
primary
employer,
but
on
those
secondary
employers
who
chose
to
intertwine
their
fate,
who
had
a
unity
of
interest
with
the
primary
on
the
chain
of
production.
the
result
as
it
was
in
many
other
labor
parts...
portions
of
the
labor
law...
was
a
compromise.
some
picketing
was
allowed,
some
picketing
was
prohibited.
some
coercion
was
allowed,
some
collusion
was
prohibited.
and
some
handbilling
and
other
publicity
was
permitted,
and
some
handbilling
and
other
publicity
was
prohibited.
this
was
spelled
out
in
the
publicity
proviso,
the
section
8(b)(4).
under
that
proviso
handbilling
could
take...
or
any
other
publicity
besides
picketing
is
permitted
if
three
conditions
are
met.
first,
the
handbilling
cannot
be
misleading.
it
must
be
for
the
purpose
of
truthfully
advising
the
public.
secondly,
it
cannot
result
in
a
work
stoppage
at
a
secondary
site.
and
finally,
there
must
be
a
producer/distributor
relationship
between
the
primary
and
the
secondary.
if
those
conditions
are
met,
and
notwithstanding
that
the
union's
conduct
is
coercive,
it's
protected
by
the
proviso.
if
any
of
those
conditions
are
not
met,
however,
and
the
prohibitions
of
section
8(b)(4)
would
otherwise
be
applicable,
then
there's
an
unlawful
secondary
boycott.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
integral
component
of
that
compromise,
a
carefully
established
congressional
balance,
the
producer/distributor
relationship
of
the
proviso
is
to
be
respected,
and
if
it
is
respected,
whether
that
deference
is
compatible
with
the
first
amendment.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
generally
stipulated
and
not
in
dispute
and
they're
relatively
simple.
we
here
have
a
company,
a
general
contractor
by
the
name
of
high,
who
is
engaged
to
build
a
department
store
for
a
retailer
by
the
name
of
wilson.
the
store
is
to
be
built
as
an
addition
to
an
existing
shopping
center
that's
already
in
operation,
and
it's
owned
by
the
petitioner,
debartolo.
the
center
has
an
85
tenant
stores.
it
has
two
or
three
major
retailers,
wards,
penneys,
belks,
and
wilson's
is
going
to
be
the
fourth.
the
union
does
not
have
any
dispute
with
any
of
those
tenants,
does
not
have
any
dispute
with
debartolo.
its
dispute
is
with
high,
because
high
is
not
paying
union
standard
wages
and
benefits.
in
order
to
pressure
high,
the
union
passes
out
handbills
at
all
the
entrances
to
the
center
and
at
various
entrances
to
some
of
the
tenant
stores.
the
handbills
are
not
directed
at
high's.
they're
not
directed
at
wilson's.
they're
not
confined
to
informing
the
public
about
the
dispute
the
union
has
with
high.
instead,
what
they
ask
is
that
the
consumers
boycott
all
the
stores
at
the
center,
in
big
bold
capital
letters
at
the
top
of
the
handbill
which
is
at
page
84,
the
joint
appendix.
it
says,
don't
shop
at
east
lake
square
mall.
the
handbill
specifically
asks
the
customers
not
to
patronize
the
tenant
stores.
the
board
in
the
court
below
held
that
that
handbill
was
protected
by
the
proviso,
that
even
though
it
was
otherwise
a
impermissible
attempt
to
coerce
secondaries,
the
tenant
stores,
it
fell
within
the
producer/distributor
language
of
the
proviso.
the
reasoning
was
that
the
product
that
was
produced
by
high,
the
wilson
store,
was
not
only
being
distributed
by
wilson,
it
was
being
distributed
by
all
the
other
tenant
stores
that
were
part
of
the
shopping
center.
now
we
don't
dispute
here
and
have
never
disputed
that
wilson's
was
distributing
a
product
produced
by
high.
but
under
servette
that's
a...
and
the
other
cases
the
board
has
decided
since
servette...
that
was
a
distribution,
the
union
could
have
properly
passed
out
its
handbill
urging
customers
not
to
patronize
wilson's.
they
could
of
course
have
picketed
high.
that
would
have
been
primary
picketing.
they
could
have
engaged
in
any
kind
of
non-coercive
activity
they
wanted,
to
publicize
their
dispute
because
then
you
would
not
have
been
under
section
8(b)(4)
at
all.
our
disagreement
is
with
the
conclusion
that
the
union
could
coercively
handbill
the
tenant
stores.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
coercively
handbilling
is
saying
do
not
patronize
this
store.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
do
not
shop--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--it's
coercing
the
tenant
stores
to
force
them
to
stop
doing
business,
presumably,
or
put
pressures
somehow
on
wilson's
and
through
wilson's
on
high.
the
object
is
to--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--we
would
have
had
no
dispute
with
the
handbill
and
it
wouldn't
have
fallen
under
section
8(b)(4).
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no.
the
difference
is
when
you
inflict
economic
injury.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
distinction
that's
been
drawn
for
the
statute...
the
statute
uses
the
word
coerce,
restraint
and
threaten,
section
8(b)(4).
the
way
those
terms
have
been
defined,
and
i
think
it's
explained
at
footnote
11
in
servette,
is
where
you're
making
a
request,
where
you're
asking
somebody
voluntarily
to
do
something.
here's
our
dispute.
and
that's
all
that
the
union
was
doing
was
disseminating
information
about
its
dispute,
then
that
wouldn't
have
been
coercive.
but
the
type
of
activity
where
you
say,
do
not
patronize,
as
in
every
board
case...
they
are
cited
at
note
8
of
our
principal
brief,
note
14
of
our
reply
brief...
every
case,
do
not
patronize
language
has
been
considered
coercive.
it
falls
within
the
proviso
because
now
you're
putting
economic
pressure
on.
if
you
were
saying,
we
had
a
dispute
with
high,
and
that's
all
the
union
was
saying,
then
that
would
be
permissibly
disseminating--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--it's
the
do
not
shop
language
that
then
becomes
coercive
under
the
act,
because
now
there's
economic
pressure
being
put
on
the
secondary.
and
that's,
i
don't
think,
disputed
by
any
of
the
parties
in
the
case.
no
one's
ever
claimed
that
this
was
not
coercive
handbilling,
within
the
meaning.
they've
only
claimed,
that
even
though
it's
coercive,
it
fell
within
the
proviso.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
victims
are
the
tenant
stores--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--the
victims
are
the
tenant
stores
who
are
losing
patronage
because
of
a
dispute
that
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
whatsoever.
they
are
losing
patronage
because
of
customers
who
get
the
handbill
and
do
not
shop
at
the
tenant
stores,
therefore,
cost
them
business.
the
store,
the
tenant,
the
belks
or
the
store--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
the
problem
of
the
case.
we
don't
know--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--the
coercion...
they're
putting
pressure
on
the
tenant
store.
and
normally
in
a
secondary
case
if
the
pressure's
put
on
the
secondary
because
the
secondary
has
some
leverage
over
the
primary,
the
secondary--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--that's...
and
that's
why
congress
forbid
it.
if
it
was
a
normal
case--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--they
forbid
it
if
it's
coercion--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--because
the
effect
is
the
same.
the
effect
is
that
we
lose...
we
lose
customers.
we
are
being...
we
are
being
coerced
even
though
we
can't
do
anything
about
the
coercion.
it
has
the
affect
of
costing
us
business
as
tenant
stores,
at
the
same
time
that
we
can't
correct
what
is
the
problem
that's
giving
rise
to
the
union
pressure.
that's
why
when
congress
drew
this
producer/distributor
language--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--if
it
isn't
coercion,
it
doesn't
fall
under
section
8(b)(4).
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
and
if
it
doesn't
fall
under
section
8(b)(4)
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--that's
right.
now,
the
board
says
we're
being
coerced
because
we
can
do
something.
we
can
go
ahead
and
tell
wilson's,
please
get
rid
of
high,
and
therefore,
end
the
labor
problems.
the
union...
i
mean...
the
union
and
the
labor
board's
position
is
that
we
can
solve
the
problem.
and
since
we
can
solve
the
problem,
we
fall
within
the
producer/distributor
language.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
there's
no
dispute
here.
it
has
never
been
argued
at
any
stage
of
this
proceeding,
and
it
has
not
been
argued
in
any
other
board
case
like
this.
they
say
they're
all
cited
at
note
8
and
note
14.
it
wasn't
argued
in
servette
that
conduct
of
the
type
involved
here
fell
within
the
coercion
restraint
with--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--as
that
term
has
been
defined
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
and
that's...
that's
what
we--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--well,
it's
conceivable
that
tenants
might
say,
we
are
losing
business,
and
go
to
debartolo,
the
owner,
and
ask
debartolo
then
to
go
to
wilson's.
and
then
ask
wilson's
in
turn
to
go
to
high.
but
we're
many,
many
stages
down
the
chain
and
all
that's
speculative.
it
was
stipulated
in
the
record,
here,
that
neither
debartolo
nor
the
tenants
had
any
power
whatsoever
to
get
rid
of
wilson's
and
to
get
rid
of
high,
that
that
was
solely
wilson's
decision.
and
that
was
the
stipulation
of
fact--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
the
reason
we
use
the
unity
of
interest
test
is
because
that
was
the
term
that
was
referred
to
in
the
congressional
debates
arising
out
of
the
goldfinger
case.
it
was
the
term
that
was
referred
to
by
the
contemporary
commentators.
it
was
a
term
that
servette
said
was
the
accepted
definition
at
the
time.
what
that
test
means
is
that
a
union
follow
through
the
chain
of
distribution
to
anyone
in
that
chain
who
adds
to
the
value
of
the
product,
and
put
pressure
on
anyone
on
that
chain
because
they
are
enhancing
the
value
of
what
the
union
is
doing...
i
mean,
what
the
primary
is
doing.
if
somebody
adds
the
value
in
the
terms
of
the
advertising,
if
somebody
adds
value
in
the
terms
of
being
a
wholesaler
like
in
servette,
they
are
helping
the
distribution
of
the
product
which
the
union
has
its
dispute
with.
so
the
union
follows
through
the
product
and
is
able
under
the
statute
to
handbill
any
of
those
people,
and
advise
the
public
that
they
are
assisting
the
practices
which
the
union
deems
to
be
unfair.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
would
leave
out,
in
this
case,
the
tenants
who
are
not--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--according
to
the
board...
one
of
the
board
decisions
is
since
there's
no
situs
requirement
in
the
statute,
yes,
you
could.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
under
our
test,
you
could.
our
test
goes
to
the
nature
of
where
you
are
in
the
chain
of
production.
the
producer/distributor
language
needs
to
mean
something.
congress
put
it
in.
it
didn't
say
all
employers,
it
said
producer
and
distributor.
in
order
to
find
what
that
means,
we
submit
that
that
means
any...
as
the
board
defined
it,
in
the
lohman
case
and
has
applied
it
in
every
case
up
to
pet
and
this
case...
if
you
add
something
to
the
value
of
the
product,
tangible
or
intangibly,
in
the
form
of
labor,
and
that
labor
can
take
capital,
it
can
take
enterprise,
it
can
take
service.
if
you
enhance
the
value
of
the
product
in
any
way
then
you
are
on
the
chain
of
production
and
you
are
part
of
the
unity
of
interest
and
you
fall
within
the
producer/distributor,
and
the
union
could
handbill
here.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
where
the
board
is
wrong.
and
that's
where
we
disagree
with
the
board.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
because
tenants
of
a
shopping
center
are
not
engaged
in
a
joint
venture.
they're
competitors
at
many
times.
they're
all
competing
for
the
same
business.
one
tenant--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--but
those
people
may
be
shopping
at
my
store
rather
than
your
store.
and
those
people
may
come
and
take
away
business
from
me.
the
only
relationship
we
have
is
we're
neighbors
who
share
common
costs.
everybody
in
an
office
building
are
neighbors
who
share
common
costs.
everyone
who
is
in
an
industrial
park
are
neighbors
who
share
common
cost.
the
value
is
being
enhanced
not
only
of
the
tenants
in
the
store...
if
you
look
at
the
diagram
of
the
shopping
center
that's
in
the
joint
appendix,
you'll
see
there's
a
circle
of
restaurants,
burger
king's
and
sambo's
and
others
around
the
wilson
store.
obviously
they're
all
going
to
be
better
off
if
there's
a
functioning
wilson's
just
like
all
the
tenants
are.
they
are
going
to
have
gotten
more
customers,
too.
but
no
one's
ever
claimed
that
they
are
part
of
some
joint
merchandising
venture
which
is
what
the
board
says
the
shopping
center
is.
one
tenant
has
no
control
and
no
relationship
with
another
tenant
other
than
the
fact
that
they're
located
on
the
same
premises
and
they
share
certain
common
costs.
well,
that's
true
of
many,
many
other
types
of
relationships.
and
if
all
of
those
people
are
going
to
be
embroiled
in
the
labor
disputes
of
the
high
and
the
bank
that
contributes
to
the
existing
store
or
anybody
who's
contributing
to
creating
the
existing
store,
then
we
really
have
read
the
producer/distributor
language
out
of
the
act
altogether.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
handbilling
was
aimed
here
to
try
to
cause
the
tenant
stores
to
lose
customers
in
the
hope
that
somehow
that
would
put
pressure
on
high
who
was
the
primary.
and
by
putting
pressure
on
high,
and
what
the
union
believed
to
be,
that
high's
unfair
practice
is
in
not
paying
union
standard
wages
and
benefits.
when
we
look
at
the...
at
what
the
producer/distributor
language
is
to
mean,
it...
we
have
referred
in
our
brief
at
various
points
to
the
words,
what
those
words
mean
in
other
labor
laws,
to
what
they
mean
elsewhere
in
the
act,
to
what
they
were
referred
to
by
members
of
congress,
and,
finally,
to
what
the
board
itself
said
was
the
unity
of
interest
standard.
and
in
servette
that
was
the
exact
test
that
it
proposed
to
this
court.
it
said
that
while
a
union
should
be
able
to
follow
the
product,
they
should
not
be
able
to
spread
a
labor
dispute
more
widely
through
the
community
by
putting
pressure
upon
any
firm
that
had
any
form
of
business
relations
with
the
firm
engaged
in
the
labor
dispute.
now
that's
what
it
did
here.
it
allowed
pressure
on
a
firm
just
because
they
had
business
relationships.
debartolo...
i
mean,
the
tenants
having
a
relationship
with
debartolo
who
in
turn
had
a
relationship
with
wilson's
who
in
turn
had
a
relationship
with
high.
that's
not
the
way
the
board
has
ever
defined
the
unity,
producer/distributor
and
that's
not
the
way
that
the
congress
intended
that
it
be
defined.
let
me
address
briefly
the
board's
first
amendment
concerns
because
they
are--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--the
first
amendment
argument
was
not
considered
because
of
the
interpretation
of
the
proviso
being
that
this
fell
within
the
proviso,
therefore
there
was
no
prohibited
conduct.
and
since
there
was
no
prohibited
conduct
we
don't
have
to
address
the
first
amendment.
in
the
pet
case,
the
other
case,
the
first
amendment
issue
was
remanded
to
the
board.
the
board
has
never
addressed
the
first
amendment
as
such.
it
has
presumed,
however,
in
the
delta
airlines
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
that
the...
adds
the
constitution--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--that's
correct.
it's
here
only
if...
by
reason
of
the
argument...
that
if
you
accept
what
we
are
arguing,
then
the
board
says
that
you
will
have
a
potential
first
amendment
violation.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
perhaps,
then,
maybe
i
should
reserve
my
time
to
hear
what
the
board
has
to
say
on
the
issue
and
address
that,
unless
the
court
has
any
questions.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
we
do,
if
that's
before
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
we
think
there's
no
first
amendment
concern.
i
can
summarize
briefly
the
reasons.
they're
two-fold.
first
let
me
reiterate
that
the
union
here
had
many
ways
to
communicate
its
message,
that
what
we
have
here
is
not
a
restriction
on
all
forms
of
communication.
we
have
a
restriction
on
one
limited
form
of
communication
which
is
secondary
coercive
handbilling
that
falls
outside
the
proviso.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
because
it's
publicity
other
than
picketing
that
doesn't
fall
within
the
producer/distributor
relationship.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
it
could...
it
could
picket,
as
we
say,
the
primary.
it
could--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--they
could
convey...
all--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--they
could
convey...
the
only
thing
they
couldn't
convey
was,
do
not
patronize
an
unrelated
secondary
employer.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
we're
saying
the
pressure
that
they
put
on
the
secondary
is
what
is--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--just
like
picketing,
it's
entirely.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
but
the--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--that's
right.
the
evil
the
congress
addressed
here
was
coercion
on
a
secondary
employer,
whether
by
picketing
or
otherwise.
but
the
entire
source
of
the
coercion
is
communication.
and
the
entire
basis
for
saying
it's
not
protected
is
that
its
content
is
unprotected?
that's
correct.
and
i
think
there's
a
substantial
government
interest
in
regulating
that
content
because
it's
part
of
the
delicate
balance
that
congress
drew
between
allowing
a
union
to
disseminate
information
and
prohibit
getting
secondaries
embroiled
in
the
labor
conflicts
of
others.
and
as
part
of
that
delicate
balance
that
justice
blackmun
referred
to
in
safco.
i
understand
your
concerns
because
you
expressed
them
in
safco,
too,
of
course.
but
that
picketing
was...
while
picketing
can
be
more
coercive,
what
congress
addressed
was
the
evil
of
secondary...
coercion
of
a
secondary
employer.
and
why...
not
degrees
of
coercion...
and
as
long
as
it
fell
within
what
congress...
whether
it
was
misleading;
whether
it
was
causing
a
secondary
work
stoppage
or
was
outside
the
producer/distributor
relationship.
those
are
the
three
conditions.
and
if
you
didn't
fall
within
those
three
conditions
you
weren't
saved
by
the
proviso.
that
was
the
balance
that
congress
drew
and
we
think
it
out
to
be
respected.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
evil
here
is
that
pressure
not
to
patronize
a
secondary
employer.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
in
our
opinion,
yes,
because
it
doesn't
meet
the
producer/distributor
test.
it
has
to
meet
three
tests.
it
didn't
meet
that
test.
and
no
matter
what
form
of
publicity
it
took
it
would
be
similarly
condemned.
i'd
like
to
say
that--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--the...
congress
drew
a
line
between
two
types
of
activity,
picketing
which
only
can
take
place
at
a
primary
site,
publicity
other
than
picketing
which
can
take
place
at
any
place
and
any
form
if
three
tests
are
met.
and
if
it
was
untruthful,
whether
it
was
a
newspaper
ad
or
a
letter,
it
would
be
condemned.
if
it
caused
a
secondary
work
stoppage,
whether
it
was
a
newspaper
ad
or
a
letter,
it
would
be
condemned,
and
if
there's
no
producer/distributor
relationship
and
it's
coercive,
then
it's
condemned
no
matter
what
form
it
takes.
that's
the
line
that
congress
drew
and
that's
the
balance
that
it
struck
and
that's
the
balance
we
think
is
constitutional.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
there
are
three
points
i'd
like
to
make.
first,
analytically
you
never
get
to
the
question
of
the
proviso
unless
there
is
coercion.
we
don't
have
coercion.
we
don't
have
an
8(b)(4)
violation.
if
we
don't
have
an
8(b)(4)
violation
then
we
aren't...
we
would
not
be
here
today.
every
board
case...
and
they're
cited
at
page
9,
footnote
8,
of
our
brief
and
page
13,
note
14,
of
our
reply
brief...
every
board
case
from
the
enactment
of
the
proviso,
from
lohman
on,
has
said
that
conduct
of
the
type
that's
engaged
in
here
was
coercive.
the
board
said
so
in
its
brief
in
servette.
there's
been
no
argument
by
anybody
at
any
point
that
the
conduct
here
was
not
coercive.
it
must
be
coercive.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
board
did
not
make
a
finding,
but
on
all...
they
said
in
all
previous
cases
after
remands
back
and
other
statements,
in
lohman
and
great
western...
in
all
the
cases
we
cite
in
our
brief
they
found
that
do
no
patronize
activity
is
coercive.
so
there's
no
purpose--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
--i
would
pick
lohman.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
lohman
and...
they're
all
sited
at
page
9,
note
a.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
board's
brief
in
servette...
any
of
those.
they're
all
equal,
because
they're
all
the
same
type
of
activity.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
all
handbilling...
all
do
not
patronize
handbilling.
the
second
point
to
make
is,
if
incoercive,
then
we
get
to
the
proviso
in
the
producer/distributor
test.
now
the
board
admits
in
its
briefs...
it
says
very
clearly...
the
board
has
not
read
servette
to
permit
disregarding
the
producer/distributor
language
altogether.
producer/distributor
has
got
to
mean
something.
does
it
cover
the
type
of
attenuated
relationship
we
have
here?
well,
let's
take
the
example
that
the
boycott
the
union
sought
here
was
totally
one
hundred
percent
effective.
nobody
came
in
to
shop
at
the
shopping
center.
would
that
have
any
effect
whatsoever
on
high?
the
answer
is
no.
now
if
that's
what
congress
intended
by
producer/distributor,
that's
not
the
way
the
act
has
been
interpreted.
and
in
any
other
law
it's
not
the
way
that
any
member
of
congress
said
it,
not
what
senator
kennedy
was
referring
to.
it's
the
exact
opposite
of
any
normal
meaning
of
those
words.
there's
no
way
that
the
tenants
here
have
any
leverage
over
any
of
the...
over
wilson's...
or
over
high,
excuse
me...
there's
no
way
the
tenants
can
effectuate
his
labor
policies.
there's
no
way
that
they
add
in
any
way
to
anything
that
high
does.
and
the
pressure's
being
put
on
the
tenants.
so
how
are
they
part
of
the
distribution/producer
scheme?
finally,
first
amendment
argument.
claiborne
is
the
case
that
mr.
come
cites.
in
claiborne,
this
court
said
secondary
boycotts
and
picketing
by
labor
unions
may
be
prohibited
constitutionally
as
part
of
congress
striking
the
balance,
delicate
balance
between
union
freedom
of
expression
and
the
ability
of
neutral
employers
and
employees
and
consumers
to
remain
free
from
coerced
participation
in
an
industrial
strike.
that's
the
delicate
balance.
that
balance
gives
unions
certain
rights
of
expression.
handbilling,
as
long
as
there's
a
producer/distributor
relationship.
handbilling,
as
long
as
it's
not
misleading.
handbilling,
as
long
as
it
doesn't
cause
a
secondary...
handbilling
or
any
form
of
publicity
as
long
as
it
doesn't
cause
a
secondary
work
stoppage.
if
those
are
met
the
union's
got
full
freedom
of
expression.
the
union's
always
got
freedom
of
expression
as
long
as
it
doesn't
get
engaged
in
coercion
and
restraint
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
here,
it
engaged
in
coercion
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
it
did
not
meet
the
terms
of
the
proviso.
therefore
there's
a
limited,
narrow
evil
that
congress
addressed,
which
is
applicable
here
and
this
court
has
held
that
just
as
in
the
case
of
secondary
picketing
it
meets
the
narrow
evil,
any
form
of
coercion
as
long
as
it's
not
too
broad,
and
this
is
not
too
broad,
may
be
regulated
within
the
constitutional
powers
of
the
congress.
thank
you.
