does
the
record
really
tell
us
how
much
of
each
is
involved--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
we
don't
know
how,
we
don't
know
if
the
city
was
signatory
or
what.
it
seems
like
a
pretty--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--did
the
city
make
the
argument
about
the
federal
policy
that
is
being
made
now
in
these
briefs
to
the
court
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
as
to
those,
the
federal
grant
programs
seem
to
mandate
some
degree
of
preference
for
local
hiring.
now,
how
do
you
deal
with
that
in
the
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
it
seems
to
have
had
rather
little
attention,
i
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
but
let's
talk
about
it
insofar
as--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
udag
funds
are--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--marked
and
the
federal
regulations
are
applicable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
we
had
a
case
where
the
city's
order
matched
in
all
respects
the
federal--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mandate,
what
does
that
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kingston,
i
guess
all
we
have
in
front
of
us,
though,
is
those
things
to
which
the
executive
order
would
apply,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
have
before
us
the
city's
executive
order
requirements.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
under
the
terms
of
the
executive
order,
it
says
that
it's
limited
to
those
projects
to
which
the
city
is
a
signatory
to
the
construction
contract.
so
we
aren't
really
concerned
about
the
others,
are
we?
