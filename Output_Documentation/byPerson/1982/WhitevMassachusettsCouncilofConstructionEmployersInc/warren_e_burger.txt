mr.
tribe,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--was
that
not
true
of
the
recent
alaska
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kingston.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
tribe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
earlier
argument
you
seemed
to
rest
quite
heavily
on
the
proposition
that
boston
was
entitled
to
have
these
jobs
to
take
care
of
its
unemployment.
but
isn't
it
an
economic
reality
that
for
every
body
occupying
a
job
in
one
place
it
means
that
a
body
in
some
other
place
doesn't
have
that
job?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
does
that
money
come
from?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
80
percent
of
it
comes
from
the
federal
government.
so
does
that
have
some
bearing
on
the
commerce
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
white
against
massachusetts
council
will
be
announced
by
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
rehnquist.
