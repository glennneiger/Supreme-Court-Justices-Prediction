justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
leave
udag
grants
again,
mr.
tribe,
for
a
moment,
what
is
it
that
the
city
itself
actually
does
or
performs
on
these
udag
grants
that
would
make
those
programs
proprietary
rather
than
governmental?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
isn't
all
that
governmental?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
isn't
there
some
of
this
federal
market
participation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
talk
about
the
privilege
and--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--because
residents
of
every
other
community
in
massachusetts
are--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kingston.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps
you
have
already
answered
justice
o'connor
to
this
respect.
but
are
there
any
projects
covered
by
this
order...
it's
an
executive
order,
as
i
understand
it...
that
are
not
either
public
works
or
direct
subsidies
by
the
city
or
these
udag
projects?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
within
either
of
those
classes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
boston.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
covered
by
udag?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
nothing
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
for
our
purposes,
may
we
treat
this
case
as
presenting
under
the
executive
order
only
the
two
classes
i
have
mentioned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
city,
city-funded
or
udag.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
couldn't
be
more
than
udag?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
did
you
just
suggest
that
the
udag
coverage
of
these,
udag,
might
be
saved,
as
by
the
commerce
clause
argument,
by
the
federal
regulations
requiring
the
local
hiring
preferences
but
that
if
that
were
so,
you
would
still
make
the
privileges
and
immunities
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
concede,
or
do
you,
that
the
federal
regulations
really
save
the
udag
coverage?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what,
mr.
kingston,
is
your
answer
to
mr.
tribe's
argument:
yes,
but
94
percent
of
those
involved
are
residents
of
other
communities
in
massachusetts,
so
there's
no
discrimination
between
residents
of
several
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
privileges
and
immunities.
