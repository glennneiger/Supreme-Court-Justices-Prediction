mr.
paul
j.
kingston
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
city
of
boston,
often
referred
to
as
the
"athens
of
america"
because
of
its
rich
cultural
and
historical
heritage,
we
believe
has
placed
in
jeopardy
the
very
premise
for
which
that
heritage
stands;
and
that
is,
the
right
for
all
to
participate
in
and
benefit
by
the
city's
life
without
regard
to
their
place
of
residence.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
no,
i
don't,
justice
white.
but
we
have
an
entirely
different--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--they
may
do
so.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
they
may
do
so
because
they
are
involved
with
something
that
is
integral
to
their
very
purpose;
and
that
is,
to
provide
education
for
their
children.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
because
at
that
point
the
city
is
not
acting
with
respect
to
an
integral
government
function.
the
city
is
not
in
the
business--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--they
do--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--the
city
does
not
build
the
school
building
in
the
sense
that
they
have
their
own
employees
perform...
the
city
is
not
in
the
contracting
business.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
there'd
be
no
different,
justice
white.
the
point
is
that
the
city
is
not
in
the
business
of
contracting.
when
the
city
builds
a
public
building,
they
normally
contract
with
a...
a
private
contractor.
and
therein
lies
one
of
the
key
points
of
the
respondents:
that
the
city
is
attempting
to
overreach
into
a
relationship
beyond
which
it
should
properly
be
able
to
exercise
some
control.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
i
think,
yes,
justice
white,
they
could
under
the
court's
decision
in
mccarthy
v.
the
elks--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--the
firemen's
case,
that's
correct.
they
could.
but
that's
a
crucial
and
essential
distinction.
the
city
has
not
hired
its
own
complement,
its
own
work
force
to
engage
in
the
activities
which
are
here
before
you.
approximately
two-thirds
of
the
construction
activity
in
1980
to
which
the
executive
order
was
applicable
involved
these
udag
projects.
and
they
do
not
involve
public
schools
or
buildings
or
roads,
they
involve
private
office
buildings,
luxury
condominiums,
marinas--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--well--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
with
respect
to
that,
the...
in
the
first
instance,
the
federal
regulations,
of
course,
apply
only
to
the
scope
of
the
order
as
the
order
applies
to
udags.
the
order
also
applies
to
city-funded
projects
to
which
the
federal
regulations--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--insofar
as--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--involved--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--all
right.
to
that
extent,
justice
o'connor,
in
fact,
the
order
does
not
comport
with
the
boundaries
of
the
federal
regulations
because
the
udag
regulations...
which
incidentally
have
been
amended
since
this
case
began,
so
i
am
not
precisely
sure
where
all
of
this
fits
at
the
moment...
but
those
federal
regulations,
insofar
as
i
see,
require
a
preference
with
respect
to
unemployed
residents.
the
order
doesn't
target
that
way.
and
in
the
federal
regulations
would
require
a
preference
in
the
locale
where
the
building
project
is
ongoing.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
at
that
point,
justice
o'connor,
first
there
are
other
federal
projects
other
than
those
administered
by
hud,
the
udags.
the
department
of
transportation,
for
example,
also
has
a
set
of
regulations,
and
those
regulations
specifically
preclude
a
municipality
from
excluding
people
based
on
their
residence.
but
apart
from
that
point,
focusing
again
on
the
udags,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
would
still
be
left
very
clearly
with
the
privileges
and
immunities
portion
of
this
case,
because
there
there
would
be
personal
rights
which
would
have
been
and,
we
argue,
have
been
and
are
adversely
affected.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
yes,
justice
brennan.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
are
there
any
projects
which
are
not--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--are
there...
the
scope
of
the
order
would
cover
either
projects
entirely
funded
with
city
dollars--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--by
boston.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
or
covered
by
udags.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
there
may
be,
justice
brennan,
some
projects
which
have
not
been
identified
but
which
would
have
been
covered
under
the
department
of
transportation
i
alluded
to
a
moment
ago.
and
in
that
respect,
the
federal
regulations
are,
it
seems
to
me,
diametrically
opposed
to
the
udag
regulations.
we
have
not
identified
which
goes
up.
but
the
terms
of
the
order,
however--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--two
classes
being
city-funded--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
because
the
terms
of
the
order
apply
to
all
projects--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--to
which
the
city
is
the
contributing--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--source
or
any
project
involving
federal
funds.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
it
is
not
limited
to--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--it
could
clearly
be
more
than
udag.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
brennan.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
no,
we
don't
concede
that
the
federal
regulations
save
the
udag.
we
believe
that
they
are
inconsistent
with
the
udag
because
they
are
not
properly
targeted
to
unemployed
in
the
locale.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
respondents
do.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
your
honor,
i
don't--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--i
do
not
have
a
case
for
that
precise
situation.
but
the
commerce
clause
representing
an
affirmative
grant
of
power
to
the
congress,
it
would
seem
to
me
there
would
be
some
substantial
reason
for
acknowledging
that
the
city
could
put
such
limitations
in
its
regulations
and
the
city
or
the
states
might
be
able
to
do
by
virtue
of
that
grant
to
the
cities
and
the
states
what
those
cities
and
the
states
could
not
otherwise
do.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
understand
that
there
is
that
grant
of
power
to
the
congress.
here
we
are
dealing
with
personal
rights,
and
in
respondents'
view,
the
congress
would
not
have
the
power
to
strip
individuals
of
their
right
to
earn
a
livelihood.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
and
my
response,
justice
white,
is
that
while
i
do
not
have
a
case--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--they
could
not.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause
or
the
privileges
and
immunities?
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
all
right.
with
respect
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
we
do
not,
of
course,
have
a
de
nunc
precedent
which
is
available
in
the
commerce
clause.
however,
several
points
seem
appropriate.
one,
with
respect
to
the
boston
order,
suburban
residents
in
massachusetts
had
no
greater
access
to
the
political
process
which
produced
the
executive
order
than
did
non-massachusetts
residents.
secondly,
the
state
statute
which
the
mayor
cited
as
authority
for
the
promulgation
of
that
executive
order,
and
which
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
found
to
be
unconstitutional,
that
statute
in
giving
the
localities
a
preference
or
allowing
them
to
make
a
preference
for
employment
in
their...
with
respect
to
their
residents,
gave
each
community
within
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
something,
whereas
non-massachusetts
residents
got
nothing.
so
that--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--well,
my
point,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
the
state
statute
upon
which
the
executive
order
was
premised
in
itself
allowed
the
suburbs
and
gave
them
a
preference
with
respect
to
public
construction
works
within
their
locality.
so
insofar
if
the
point
is
that
the
non-massachusetts
residents
had
representation
in
the
process,
if
that
was
the
point,
what
i
am
answering
is
that
they
did
not
have
representation
in
the
process
because
the
other
suburbs
were
getting
something
in
the
deal,
if
you
will.
they
were
getting
a
local
preference
with
respect
to
projects
within
their
communities,
whereas
the
non-massachusetts
residents
got
nothing.
we
recognize
the
court's
pronouncements
in
hughes
v.
alexandria
scrap
and
reeves
that
if
the
city
is
acting
as
a
market
participant,
the
commerce
clause
is
simply
not
applicable.
but
the
scope
of
the
order,
as
we
have
described,
to
private
construction
projects
where
no
city
dollars
are
involved,
and
the
scope
of
the
project
to
persons
with
whom
the
city
has
no
relationship
reveals,
we
believe,
the
city's
role
not
as
a
market
participant
but
as
a
market
regulator.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
no,
justice
white.
with
respect
to
the
udag's,
the
city
is
not--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--it
applies
to
the
federal
government
for
these
federal
funds.
it
then,
if
the
federal
government
decides
to
make
that
grant,
it
is
a
conduit
for
the
transfer
of
those
funds
to
the
developer
for
the
construction
of
the
udag
project.
when
i
said
earlier
these
projects
relate
to
condominiums
and
office
buildings,
it
was
no
exaggeration.
there
is
not
a
udag
project
in
the
city
of
boston
which
does
not
fall
within
one
of
those
categories.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
the
premise,
justice
white,
is
to
leverage
private
reinvestment
in
our
nation's
cities.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
i
don't
understand
that
they
are
automatically
given.
the
federal
government--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--oh,
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
the
city
applies.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
that's
correct.
but
that's
the
extent
of
it,
your
honor.
once
those
federal
dollars
come
in,
they
are
transferred
to
the
developer
and
the
private
project
begins.
my
brother
makes
reference
to
the
infrastructure.
a
certain
amount
of
those
udag
dollars
are
provided
for
the
traffic
rerouting,
for
the
streets
and
the
sewers.
but
respondents'
position
is,
if
the
city
can
obtain
market
participant
immunity
on
that
attenuated
basis,
there
is
virtually
no
private
construction
project
in
the
city
which
would
not
merit
participation
partnership.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
no,
your
honor.
we
also
challenge--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--with
respect--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--that's
correct.
and
in
that
regard,
we
consider
that
by
analogy,
if
you
will,
this
court's
decisions
in
reeves
and
in
hughes
can
be
viewed
as
prohibiting
secondary
boycotts.
that
is,
it
prohibits
the
city
from
reaching
on
the
party
with
whom
it
has
privity
and
prevents
the
city
from
dictating
terms
to
subcontractors
and
employees.
when
maryland
with
its
own
tax
dollars
provided
a
bounty
for
the
processing
of
automobile
hulks,
this
court
was
careful
to
point
out
that
maryland
had
not
sought
to
prohibit
the
flow
of
those
hulks
out
of
state.
and
in
reeves,
when
south
dakota
preferred
its
own
residents
in
the
sale
of
cement
which
had
been
produced
in
a
state-owned
facility,
which
had
been
constructed
with
state
dollars,
this
court
was
careful
to
point
out
that
south
dakota
had
not
attempted
to
restrict
the
resale
of
that
cement
to
state
citizens.
but
boston,
with
somebody
else's
money
for
the
most
part
and
for
economic
purposes,
is
attempting
to
do
something
that
this
court
would
have
prohibited
maryland
and
south
dakota
from
doing.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
i
don't
know
if
i
understand,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
well,
i
think
it
continues,
justice
o'connor,
"or
to
which
the
city
is
an
applicant
for
the
federal
funds.
"
the
scope
of
the
order
continues
beyond.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
if
it
signs
the
contracts,
justice
white--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--i
don't
believe
it
does.
but
whether
or
not
it
does--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--the
developer
would...
i'm
sorry.
maybe
the
developer
would
sign
the
contract
with
the
city.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
but
the
point
is,
there
is
no
commitment,
there
is
no
entrepreneurial
aspect,
there
is
no
assumption
of
risk,
there
is
no
financial
commitment
which
the
city
has
made
in
those
udag
projects.
and
insofar
as
the
order
applies
to
traditional
or
true
public
works
projects
which
are
funded
entirely
with
city
dollars,
we
believe
that
the
order
is
defective
because
it
reaches
beyond
the
parties
with
whom
it
has
privity
and
it
attempts
to
dictate
conditions
to
persons
with
whom
it
has
no
relationship,
results
we
understand
clearly
would
be
prohibited
by
this
court's
decisions
in
reeves
and
in
hughes.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
it
is
dictating...
first
of
all,
it
is
dictating
to
subcontractors
the
terms
of
the
order,
namely
that
they
must
hire
at
least
50
percent
boston
residents.
those
subcontractors
are
not
in
privity
with
the
city.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
that
may
be
so,
justice
rehnquist,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
if
we're
dealing
with
constitutional
matters
that
normal
contractual
matters
may
not
always
carry.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
yes.
only,
justice
rehnquist,
because
we
understand
this
court
in
hughes
and
in
reeves
suggested
that
as
a
barrier.
at
some
point
the
city
loses
its
market
participant
immunity,
remembering
that
the
market
participant
immunity
is
an
exception
in
the
first
instance
to
the
otherwise
general
and
well
established
rule
that
cities
and
states
are
not
entitled
to
throw
up
economic
barriers
in
an
attempt
to
isolate
themselves
from
problems
that
are
shared
by
all.
but
there's
a
second
feature,
justice
rehnquist,
and
that
is
that
the
order
attempts
to
preclude
non-boston
residents
and
non-massachusetts
residents
from
work
opportunity.
so
to
that
extent
as
well,
the
city
is
reaching
beyond
the
initial
party
with
whom
it
has
privity
in
an
attempt
to
dictate
conditions
which
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
do.
one
of
the
further
basic
defects
of
the
executive
order
is
that
it
invites
retaliation.
if
boston
is
able
to
have
a
resident
preference
scheme
such
as
this,
then
there
is
no
reason
why
other
cities
and
states
would
be
precluded
from
doing
the
same.
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
any
political
leader
to
resist
the
temptation
to
protection,
if
you
will,
his
constituency
in
such
a
manner.
and
this
again
gets
to
the
very
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause,
to
prohibit
forms
of
economic
balkanization.
with
respect
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
just
as
the
executive
order
triggers
scrutiny
under
the
commerce
clause,
so
too
it
triggers
scrutiny
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
and
in
this
respect,
the
court's
decision
in
hicklin
versus
orbeck
provides
the
instruction.
and
there,
when
alaska's
hire
statute
was
struck
alaska
was
not
able
to
successfully
argue
that
it
has
as
a
purpose,
as
boston
is
arguing,
an
effort
to
alleviate
unemployment,
because
there
was
no
showing
that
the
out
of
state
residents
were
a
source
of
the
unemployment
problem.
rather,
lack
of
job
training
and
lack
of
education
were.
and
further,
as
in
hicklin,
there
is
no
showing
that
the
order
is
targeted
to
address
the
problem
before
the
city.
that
is
to
say,
all
boston
residents,
whether
they're
employed
or
not,
are
given
a
preference
in
the
employment.
when...
the
order
then
contradicts
the
basic
principles
of
this
court's
decisions
in
paul
versus
virginia,
which
recognized
there
was
a
provision
of
the
constitution
which
so
tended
to
constitute
the
people
of
this
country,
one
nation,
as
that
clause,
and
in
toomer
versus
witsell,
where
this
court
advised
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
clause
was
to
help
fuse
into
one
nation
what
had
been
a
collection
of
independent
sovereign
states.
in
sum,
if
we
are
to
preserve
our
national
economic
free
trade
unit,
then
we
must
permit
it
to
flourish
without
governmental
restrictions
on
business
and
people
who
seek
work
opportunity
without
regard
to
their
place
of
residence.
this
court's
instruction
in
philadelphia
versus
new
jersey
is
so
very
relevant.
there,
in
striking
new
jersey's
statute,
the
court
held
that,
just
as
the
commerce
clause
protected
her
neighbors
today,
so
the
commerce
clause
would
protect
new
jersey
in
the
future
from
efforts
by
one
state
to
isolate
itself
in
the
stream
of
interstate
commerce
from
problems
shared
by
all.
unemployment
is
a
national
problem
and
it
can
only
be
worsened
by
permitting
retaliatory
resident
preference
schemes,
and
which
can
only
be
alleviated
by
promoting
the
infrastructure
and
the
instrumentalities
of
interstate
commerce
which
are
embodied
in
our
private
enterprise
system.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
the
economic
market
is
the
construction
market.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
i
don't
know
if
i
understand.
we
speak
of
the
construction
market
as
represented
by
the
contractors
and
by
the
laborers.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
oh,
in
that
respect.
those
statistics
are
valid
for
one
point
in
time
and
they
only
related
to
the
city-funded
projects,
not
to
the
udag
projects.
and
by
the
way,
there's
been
a
tenfold
increase
in
the
udag
activity
in
boston
over
the
past
two
or
three
years.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
the
agreed
statement
of
facts,
justice
stevens,
which
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
expressly
relied
upon
in
its
decision
contained
the
stipulation
that
out
of
state,
without
any
numerical
limitations,
out
of
state
residents
will
be
denied
work
opportunity,
contractors
will
be
discouraged
from
bidding
in
boston
construction.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
no
quantification.
a
significant
impact,
the
agreed
statement
says,
on
specialty
contractors,
resulting
in
fewer
competitive
bids
and
higher
costs
for
construction
for
all
of
the
contractors.
what
the--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--well,
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
specifically
contained
an
acknowledgment
that
it
would
have
those
disadvantages
and
those
burdens
on
interstate
commerce.
there
was
no
quantification.
so
it
did
have
that.
and
what
the
contractors
and
the
building
trade
unions
and
the
working
people
who
are
represented
by
the
private
industry
here
today,
representing
private
enterprise
in
this
context,
what
they
seek
to
do
is
to
prevent
a
discrimination
launched
at
the
very
essence
of
their
livelihood.
they
are
journeymen
by
definition,
by
history,
and
hopefully
by
constitutional
guarantee.
we
are
urging,
therefore,
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
which
by
its
findings
and
conclusion
held
the
executive
order
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
the
agreed
statement
of
facts,
justice
white,
contained
an
expression,
and
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
acknowledged
and
relied
on
it,
that
both
in-state
and
out-of-state
contractors
would
be
discouraged
from
bidding
on
boston
construction
work.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
they
would
have
to
hire
locals.
some
of
these
contractors,
especially
the
specialty
contractors,
have
permanent
work
crews,
and
when
they
come
in
they'd
have
to
disband
those
crews
to
make
up
a
local
composition.
and
even
with
respect
to
local
contractors,
there
would
be
a
disbanding
of
work
crews
in
order
go
be
sure
there
were
50
percent
of
boston
residents.
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
a
contractor?
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
well,
there
are
inefficiencies.
the
new
york
state
supreme
court
in--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--well,
that
may
be
their
problem.
but
the
commerce
clause
we
understand
is
designed
to
protect
interstate
commerce
and
to
prevent
city
and
state
regulations
which
tend
to
burden
interstate
commerce,
regardless
of
what
the
contractors
might
do,
justice
white.
they
in
fact--
mr.
paul
j.
kingston
--correct,
justice
white.
however,
we
are
challenging
the
legality
of
the
order,
the
constitutionality
of
the
order
under
the
commerce
clause
and
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
and
we
consider
the
record
amply
supports
burdens
on
interstate
commerce.
