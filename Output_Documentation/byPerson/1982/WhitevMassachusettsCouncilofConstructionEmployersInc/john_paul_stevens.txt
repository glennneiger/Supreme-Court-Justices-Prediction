mr.
tribe,
before
you
get
to
the
traditional--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--public
works,
just
pausing
with
the
public
federally
funded
projects
for
the
moment,
isn't
there
a
possibility
that
there's
a
conflict
between
some
of
the
federal
secretary's
regulations
and
the
specific
50
percent
requirement
of
the
boston
executive
order
which
might
raise
the
preemption
issue,
which
is
one
of
the
questions
that,
as
i
understand,
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
did
not
answer,
and
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
might
remain
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
the
most
part,
i
can
see
a
parallel
between
the
two.
but
isn't
it
possible
that
there
would
be
some
fringe
areas
in
which
the
50
percent
requirement
might
differ
from
the
requirement
for
low-income
persons
and
things
of
that
character?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
tribe,
your
comment
to
justice
brennan
made
me
wonder,
what
does
it
take
to
be
a
resident?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
move
there
at
the
time
the
job
starts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
an
out-of-state
contractor
brought
his
crew
in,
and
they
all
rented
rooms
in
the
fancy
hotel,
whatever
it
might
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
stayed
there
for
the
duration
of
the
job,
they'd
qualify?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
must
have
an--
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
just
one
question
on
the
commerce
clause.
what
is
the
market,
economic
market
that
you're
concerned
with
primarily?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
the
market
in
which
the
contractors
compete?
you're
not
talking
about
the
labor
market,
in
other
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
94
percent
of
the
laborers
are
not
out
of
state
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
what
is
the
impact
in
any
measurable
way
on
interstate
trade
of
any
kind,
either
employees
or
out
of
state
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
quantification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
matter
for
your
interstate
commerce
theory
what
the
facts
actually
show,
or
is
it
just
the
fact
that
there
is
this
potential
is
enough?
