justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tribe,
under
that
line
of
reasoning,
wouldn't
it
be
possible
to
say
that
the
decision
of
the
hilton
corporation
to
build
a
new
hilton
on
copely
square
might
be
thought
to
be
the
result
of
the
city's
ingenuity,
too?
i
suppose
city
efforts
to
into
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
it
were
strictly
private
funds
but
the
city
had
been
very
active
in
persuading
the
persons
who
had
the
disposition
to
private
funds
to
use
them
in
boston
rather
than
minneapolis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
the
city
stand
any
better
if
it
applies
its
regulation
to
things
that
it
had
no
part
in
funding
but
was
federally
funded,
but
it
nevertheless
had
a
great
part
in
producing
on
the
scene,
than
should
the
privately
funded
things
that
it
had
the
same
great
part
in
producing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
your
udag
argument
is
really
fairly
representative
of
the
writ
for
certiorari?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
the
question
is
presented
on
there
on
the
first
page.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
not
frightened
by
the
specter
of
balkanization
if
you
win?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kingston.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
an
ordinance
which
simply
carried
out
and
matched
perfectly
a
provision
of
a
udag
which
said
that
each
ordinance
which
gets
udag
money
shall
provide
for
50
percent
employment
of
residents
would
violate
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
if
it
represented
an
affirmative
sanction
of
congress
acting
under
its
spending
power
and
the
commerce
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
have
any
case
for
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
about
that
precise
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
that
kind
of
contradict
your
earlier
argument
that
some
suburban
residents
or
residents
of
springfield
or
northampton
don't
have
access
to
the
political
process
that
enabled
boston
to
do
this?
they
do
have
access
to
the
state
process,
and
i
suppose
the
massachusetts
legislature
could
pass
a
law
disenabling
boston
from
doing
something
like
this.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
attempts
to
dictate
conditions
to
people
with
whom
it
has
no
relationship.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
give
me
an
example,
if
you
would,
of
the
people
to
whom
it's
dictating
conditions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
a
fairly
archaic
concept
if
you
apply
it
that
way,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
lots
of
owners
sign
an
agreement
with
a
contractor
that
may
provide
that
each
of
his
subcontractors
has
to
produce
a
performance
bond,
and
that
in
a
sense
is
dictating
to
people
not
in
privity
and
yet
that's
fairly
commonly
done.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
that's
true,
and
that's
what
i
was
wondering
why
you
kind
of
resurrected
the
notion
of
privity
to
analyze
a
commerce
clause
problem.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
it's
well
established
under
our
decisions
that
the
commerce
clause
imposes
restraints
on
the
states
where
the
states
are
trying
to
regulate
the
interstate
marketplace.
but
it's
equally
well
settled
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
place
limitations
on
states
that
are
participating
in
the
marketplace
like
any
private
business
enterprise.
in
this
case,
we're
asked
to
decide
whether
the
city
of
boston
is
regulating
the
market
or
participating
in
it
when
it
enters
into
construction
contracts
where
its
own
funds
will
be
used
for
building
public
projects.
we
reached
a
different
conclusion
than
did
the
state
supreme
court.
we
have
to
determine
that
the
city
is
participating
in
the
market
and
therefore,
the
commerce
clause
is
no
obstacle
to
an
executive
order
issued
by
the
mayor
of
boston,
requiring
that
the
work
force
on
these
projects
consist
of
at
least
one
half
boston
residents.
the
mayor's
executive
order
also
applies
to
public
construction
projects
partly
financed
by
the
city
with
federal
funds.
we
have
concluded
that
this
application
of
the
executive
order
would
not
be
subject
to
any
commerce
clause
limitations
regardless
of
the
city's
rule.
it
is
well
settled
that
laws
enacted
by
congress
are
not
subject
to
the
negative
implications
of
the
commerce
clause.
in
this
case,
the
federal
regulations
for
the
relevant
funding
programs
affirmatively
permit
the
work
force
residency
preference
expressed
in
the
mayor's
order.
because
of
our
conclusion
that
the
commerce
clause
is
not
a
barrier
to
the
mayor's
executive
order
as
applied
in
this
case
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
justice
blackmun
who
was
joined
by
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
in
part
and
concurring
in
part.
