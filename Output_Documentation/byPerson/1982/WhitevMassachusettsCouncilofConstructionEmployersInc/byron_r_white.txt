justice
white
and
can
slide
by
the
boards.
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
on
that
basis,
i
suppose
you
would
argue
that
you
could
sustain
a
state
provision
or
a
local
provision,
a
city
provision,
that
any
kind
of
construction
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
enacting
government,
any
construction
should
employ
50
percent
residents?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
you
suggest
that
a
general,
a
general
provision
requiring
hiring
residents
by
any
contractor,
whether
it's
supported
by
public
funds
or
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
--why
would
that
violate
the
commerce
clause,
if
it
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
case
or
cases
are
closest
to
agreeing
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
reeves?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
help
you
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
mean.
yes.
those
are
the
ones
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that's
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
don't
support
your
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
support
your
result.
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
don't
suggest
that
boston
would
have
to
permit
nonresidents
to
attend
their
school
district,
their
schools?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
how
can
they
reserve
their
elementary
schools
to
residents?
justice
byron
r.
white
how?
why
may
they
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
can't
they,
why
can't
boston
then
require
that
only
residents
build
their
school
buildings?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
cities
normally
build
school
buildings,
and
school
districts
normally
build
school
districts...
school
buildings.
justice
byron
r.
white
nobody
else
ever
builds
them--
justice
byron
r.
white
--except
private,
private
schools
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
if
a
school
district
has
a
requirement
that
the
school
building
we
contract
to
have
built
will
be
built
by
residents
of
our
school
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
had
its
own
employees
to
build
school
buildings,
you
would
say
they
could
confine
their
employment
to
residents?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
firemen,
the
firemen's
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
congress
might
enforce
it
in
a
way
that
the
courts
might
not
otherwise;
might
expand
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your...
the
question
is
here
whether
congress
could
limit
the
reach
of
the
clause
beyond
that
that
courts
might
otherwise
find?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
could
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
the
order
restricted
to
projects
where
the
city
is
going
to
be
writing
the
check?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no,
but
it
is
the
prime
mover.
it
is
the
one
that's
doing
the
contracting,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
udag
projects,
what
is
the
premise
for
the
use
of
the
federal
funds?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
they
are
given
when
a
city
applies
for
it,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
nevertheless
the
federal
government
doesn't
go
around
and
shop
for
this,
does
it?
doesn't
it
depend
on
some
local
application?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
city
applies.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
please
help
us
out
as
a
city.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
merit
it,
but
you
wouldn't
be
satisfied
to
win
this
case
on
that
basis,
i
guess,
that
this
regulation,
this
order,
is
invalid
to
the
extent
that
federal
funds
are
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
putting
aside
those,
then
you're
talking
about
the
city
itself
paying
for
municipal
improvements.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
they
are
not
a
market
participant
in
those
because
they
are
not
using
their
own
employees
to
build
the
buildings?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
still
signs
the
contracts
in
those.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it
doesn't
sign
the
construction
contracts
where
the
federal
funds
are
provided?
who
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
bar
to
out
of
state
firms
or
no
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
you
say
that
this
requirement
may
keep
some
out
of
state
firms
from
coming
in
because
they
would
have
to
hire
locals.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
would
have
to
hire
locals?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
that
requirement
discourage
a
non-bostonian?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
inefficient,
but
they
wouldn't
bid
except
at
a
price
that
would
cover
those
inefficiencies.
and
if
they
didn't
get
the
contract
they
wouldn't
be
doing
it,
i
suppose.
is
that
their
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
building
code
might
require
certain
specifications
for
a
building
that
some
out-of-state
contractor
is
not
used
to
putting
up
with.
