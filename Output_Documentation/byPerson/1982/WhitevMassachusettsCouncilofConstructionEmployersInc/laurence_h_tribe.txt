mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
a
boston
executive
order
which
applies
to
construction
work
on
projects
for
which
the
city
makes
the
construction
contract
and
provides
public
revenues
either
from
taxes
that
the
city
itself
raises
or
from
funds
that
the
city
procures
from
the
federal
government.
to
the
extent
feasible,
at
least
half
the
jobs
that
the
city
creates
on
these
projects
must
go
to
city
residents,
and
the
issue
is
whether
the
constitution
forbids
giving
residents
this
priority.
let
me
stress
that
the
question
is
not
whether
the
city
may
divert
pre-existing
private
jobs
from
nonresidents
to
residents.
the
only
question
is
the
allocation
of
publicly
subsidized
jobs
that
the
city
itself
generates
with
its
own
foresight
and
industry.
now,
that
foresight
and
industry
by
a
city
confronting
urban
decay
and
unemployment
may
take
two
main
forms:
first,
it
may
take
the
form
of
focusing
the
city's
political
energy
on
raising
enough
local
tax
revenues
to
generate
the
needed
jobs
in
classical
public
works
projects,
like
schools
and
roads;
and
secondly,
it
may
take
the
form
of
focusing
political
energy
on
attracting
enough
federal
aid
to
the
city's
coffers
to
induce
private
firms
in
accord
with
the
terms
of
whatever
federal
grant
is
obtained
to
create
needed
jobs
in
the
construction
of
housing
or
other
forms
of
urban
renewal.
boston
has
done
both
of
these
things.
and
i
should
like
to
begin
with
the
second,
with
the
attraction
of
federal
funds,
since
i
think
that
is
the
more
innovative
and
the
more
controversial.
urban
renewal
projects
that
are
made
possible
by
efforts
made
by
the
city
of
boston
to
attract
the
federal
aid
that
such
projects
need
are
just
as
much
the
product
of
the
city's
collective
political
exertions
as
are
the
schools
and
the
streets
that
the
city
funds
through
local
taxes.
indeed,
the
state
supreme
court,
whose
judgment
is
being
reviewed
here,
said
both
in
its
opinion
and
in
the
judgment
of
that
court,
that
all
projects
covered
by
the
executive
order,
in
its
words,
are
"city-funded
construction
projects".
that's
all
the
judgment
at
page
a-17.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
in
this
case,
justice
rehnquist,
the
key
point
is
that
the
city
is
a
but-for
cause
under
the
very
terms
of
the
regulations.
under
42
u.s.
code
section
5318(j),
secretary
of
hud
must
find
a
strong
probability
that
the
whole
private
development
would
not
occur
but
for
the
specific
federal
funds.
now,
if
it
could
really
be
shown
that
in
a
particular
case
a
mix
of
public
and
private
funds
is
the
direct
result
under
the
terms
of
the
federal
statute,
the
direct
result
of
a
city
process,
a
complicated
process
of
holding
local
hearings
and
then
lobbying
for
a
grant,
then
our
reasoning
would
apply.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
suppose
that
that
would
push
our
logic
beyond
the
point
where
i
would
urge
the
court
to
take
it.
that
is,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
any
time
the
city
deserves
a
pat
on
the
head
for
having
something
happen
that
the
city
can
then
parcel
things
out
in
a
partial
way.
we
are
saying
that
when
the
federal
program
itself
identifies
a
special
role
for
cities
to
solve
problems
of
severe
economic
distress,
and
to
do
so
by
attracting
indispensable
federal
money,
then
at
least
the
jobs
on
that
project
are
indistinguishable
from
jobs
that
are
funded
by
municipal
bonds
or
by
other
things.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
suppose
the
judgments
of
degree
here
are
ones
that
this
court
might
well
leave
to
congress.
and
congress
has
drawn
that
line;
that
is,
in
the
relevant
statute,
the
housing
and
urban
development
act,
congress
specifically
said
that
with
respect
to
these
projects,
not
only
is
it
indispensable
that
the
city
and
the
developer
specify
that
the
project
couldn't
occur
otherwise,
but
once
the
project
is
funded
it
is
a
requirement
under
the
statute
that
to
the
greatest
extent
feasible,
at
least
as
to
the
job
opportunities
that
are
made
available
on
the
project,
that
those
go
to
residents
of
the
area.
and
it
seems
to
me
when
congress
has
made
that
judgment,
there
is
no
reason
in
the
name
of
the
commerce
clause
or
any
other
provision
of
the
constitution
for
the
court
to
worry
about
remote
hypotheticals
in
which
the
city
might
someday
make
a
broader
argument.
here
i
think
what
is
remarkable
about
what
the
city
of
boston
has
done
is
not
that
it
is
in
fact
reserving
to
its
citizens
half
the
jobs
on
these
public
works
projects
and
urban
renewal
projects,
but
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
city
plays
the
indispensable
role
of
generating
all
these
jobs,
it
is
willing
to
let
nonresidents
have
half
of
them
even
though
the
federal
statute
and
the
federal
regulations
say
that
to
the
maximum
extent
feasible
the
jobs
should
go
to
local
residents.
so
it
seems
to
me
as
far
as
the
federally
funded
portion
is
concerned,
when
the
city
goes
and
gets
the
money
from
the
federal
government
by
showing
that
it
is
needed
to
resolve
problems
of
severe
economic
distress,
that
at
that
point
there
is
no
basis
for
drawing
a
constitutional
distinction
based
on
where
the
money
came
from.
now,
i
do
want
to
suggest,
though,
that
any
notion
that
somehow
the
city
is
trying
to
pyramid
this
power
into
a
broad
takeover
of
the
private
sector
on
the
rationale
that
the
city
has
played
a
key
role
after
all,
but
for
the
innovation
of
the
city,
the
whole
private
sector
might
be
less
well
off.
any
such
notion
should
be
dispelled.
we
are
talking
here
about
approximately
11
percent
of
the
construction
that
is
going
on
in
the
city
of
boston,
and
we
are
talking
about
two
kinds
of
construction:
classical,
traditional
public
works
construction
funded
entirely
by
the
city
as
to
which
i
have
yet
to
see
an
argument
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
as
to
why
the
preference
is
impermissible;
and
somewhat
more
innovative
urban
development
projects
that
have
to
be
tailored
to
the
needs
of
the
neighborhood.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
o'connor,
the
record
is
ambiguous.
it...
it
suggests
if
you
turn
to
page,
i
believe
it
is,
a.
42
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
we
know
that
$483
million
approximately
is
the
total
construction,
at
least
in
the
fairly
typical
year
of
1980.
of
that
amount,
$54
million
was
covered
by
the
executive
order.
and
of
that
$54
million,
$34
million
represented
projects
that
in
some
way
or
other
involved
urban
development
action
grants.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
we
know
that
the
city
does
not
in
fact...
the
city
does
not
in
fact
sign
the
construction
contract
on
the
hotel
and
other
purely
private-seeming
parts
of
the
project.
the
city
signs
the
construction
contract
on
infrastructural
parts,
such
as
those
that
are
paid
for
by
about
$4
million
of
the
$18
million
copely
place
grant.
but
the
reason
that
i
press
the
point
to
discuss
the
entire
urban
development
action
grant
picture
is
that
no
ambiguity
about
the
record
on
that
point
could
possibly
justify
the
judgment
that
is
being
reviewed
in
this
court.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
actually,
it
was
in
the
complaint,
it
was
in
the
complaint
made
against
the
city;
that
is,
the
complaint
quoted
some
of
these
regulations.
and
it
has
always
been
puzzling
to
the
city
why
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
would
have
relied,
in
part,
on
federal
regulations
which
seems
to
us
fully
vindicate
everything
the
city
is
doing
with
respect
to
the
federally
funded
portion
in
this
case.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
have
seen
this
case
as
principally
about
city-funded
in
the
traditional
limited
sense,
city-funded
public
works
projects,
and
the
question
whether
as
to
those
projects
it
is
permissible
after
this
court's
precedents
in
hughes
and
reeves
were
the
preference.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it...
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
justice--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
that's
right.
it
was
certainly
not
mentioned
in
the
questions
presented,
although
the
questions
presented
are
broad
enough
to
encompass
it
potentially;
that
is,
tax-supported
public
works
employment,
i
would
think,
after
this
court's
decision
in
cases
like
united
transportation
union
v.
long
island,
ought
not
to
be
interpreted
in
a
static
historical
sense;
that
is,
public
works
need
not
take
the
form
of
roads
and
parks
and
schools,
they
can
take
the
form
in
the
modern
period
when
the
needs
of
a
given
decaying
urban
area
require
an
infusion
of
outside
funds
for
shopping
centers,
and
it
can
take
that
form
as
well.
and
so
the
same
fundamental
issue
is
presented,
and
indeed
in
the
petition
elsewhere
we
discuss
the
reason
that
we
did
not
think
it
made
any
difference
if
some
of
the
funds
were
federal,
on
page
20
and
21
of
the
petition.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
need
only
reach
the
question
whether
public
works
projects,
however
precisely
defined,
funded
by
city
funds,
raised
in
a
variety
of
ways,
can
be
so
administered
that
at
least
half
the
work
crews
on
those
projects
are
required
to
be
bostonians,
members...
residents
of
the
city...
i
say
"members"
having
just
heard
that
colloquy
about
membership...
residents
of
the
city
to
the
extent
feasible.
now,
when
the
city
uses
its
public
revenues
to
fund
traditional,
classical
public
works...
schools,
streets,
and
so
on--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--sir.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
would
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
would
think,
justice
stevens,
that
it
would
cut
the
other
way;
that
is,
the
other--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if
there
were
a
flat
50
percent
requirement
without
any
feasibility
test,
then
it
might.
but
at
page
25,
a.
25
of
the
petition,
the
documents
that
are
there
reproduced
specify
that
if
all
reasonable
steps
have
been
taken
to
comply
with
the
50
percent
rule,
the
contractor
shall
be
deemed
in
compliance.
and
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
fullilove
treated
best
efforts
language
of
just
that
kind
in
the
federal
public
works
provision
as
enough
to
make
it
not
a
quota
but
a
goal.
and
indeed,
in
the
copely
place
udag,
urban
development
action
grant,
which
is
described
and
relied
on
heavily
by
the
other
side,
at
page
137
of
the
grant
application
it
is
specified
that
all
the
contractor
need
do
is
take
reasonable
measures,
every
reasonable
possible
measure,
to
achieve
compliance.
but
if
the
contractor
can't
do
it
because
insufficient
qualified
workers
are
available,
he
is
excused.
so
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
if
it's
administered
in
a
way
that
is
not
only
parallel
but
completely
convergent...
and
understandably,
because
the
point
is
the
city
couldn't
get
these
federal
grants
without
conforming
its
detailed
reading
of
the
50
percent
rule
to
the
requirements
of
federal
law...
if
anything,
the
only
colorable
argument
i
could
imagine
about
any
tension
with
federal
law,
i
could
imagine
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
saying,
what
do
you
mean
just
50
percent:
we
say
that
to
the
extent
feasible
you've
got
to
target
these
jobs
to
local
residents.
and
so
it
might
be
said
that
by
feeling
satisfied
with
giving
one
out
of
every
two
jobs
to
a
bostonian,
the
city
of
boston
is
not
doing
as
much
as
federal
law
might
require,
but
i
think
here
plaintiffs
would
not
have
standing
to
raise
that
issue
in
the
court
below
or
in
this
court.
now,
if
i
might
turn
to
the
public
works
project--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
what
the
city
has
to
do
is
identify
a
developer
and
hold
local
hearings
to
make
sure
that
the
developer's
precise
plans
will
meet
the
needs
of
the
unemployed
and
underemployed
and
particularly
the
minority
residents
of
the
area.
the
city
having
held
the
hearings
then
works
out
through
a
rather
elaborate
system
of
negotiation
with
the
ultimate
developer
a
set
of
rules
that
will
comply
with
hud
requirements,
comply
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
work
force
that
will
be
retained.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it
seems
to
me
it's
governmental
in
the
same
sense
that
when
the
government
procures
something
for
its
own
police
department,
that's
governmental.
that
would
bring
it
within
the
very
core
that
every
member
of
this
court,
as
i
read
reeves,
seemed
to
agree
about;
that
is,
in
reeves
v.
steak,
what
was
troublesome
to
some
members
of
the
court,
as
i
understood
it,
about
creating
an
immunity
for
south
dakota
when
it
sold
cement
was
that
selling
cement
is
the
sort
of
activity
through
which
a
city
might
distort
the
private
market.
whereas
here
we
are
talking
about
the
very
essence
of
what
it
means
to
be
a
city;
that
is,
building
public
infrastructure
and
doing
so
in
a
way
that
meets
the
city's
own
needs.
there
is,
i
think,
a
confusing
distinction
between
proprietary
and
governmental
which
can
mean
different
things
in
different
contexts.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
it
slides
back
and
forth.
and
that's
why
we
haven't
tried
to
rely
on
those
labels,
not
knowing
quite
what
the
court
has
meant
by
them,
frankly,
or
what
one
ought
to
mean
by
them.
but
we
think
whatever
the
labels
might
be,
that
it's
awfully
hard
to
think
of
any
function
with
respect
to
which
the
small
silent
voice
of
the
commerce
clause
has
less
to
say.
it
is
the
function
that
a
city
performs
in
building
streets
and
parks
in
such
a
way
that
it
meets
its
own
local
unemployment
needs.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
federal
market
participation
so
that
congress
should
have
a
dominant
voice.
it
seems
to
me
congress
has
spoken
with
that
voice.
that's
where
this
case
is
not
silent.
what
is
silent
here
is
the
commerce
clause.
but
congress
by
statute,
and
federal
agencies
by
regulation,
have
specified
that
this
money
should
be
targeted
to
residents
of
the
city
that
applies.
to
the
extent
that's
so,
i
would
imagine
that
the
thrust
of
the
respondent's
argument
is
that
the
city
of
boston
was
insufficiently
generous
to
the
new
england
region
by
going
out
and
getting
federal
grants
that
had
this
condition
attached.
perhaps
boston
should
have
looked
for
some
kind
of
federal
grant
which
would
benefit
residents
of
new
hampshire
or
rhode
island.
but
so
far
as
boston
has
obtained
money
to
supplement
its
tight
fiscal
situation
from
the
federal
government,
it
is
surely
impermissible
to
say
that
the
silent
commerce
clause
somehow
overrides
congressional
regulation.
if
congress
were,
however,
to
tell
boston,
this
is
money
that's
available
only
if
you
use
it
to
help
people
in
western
massachusetts
and
perhaps
in
rhode
island
and
connecticut,
it'd
be
up
to
boston
whether
to
accept
that
money
or
not.
we're
not
suggesting
that
this
is
an
area
so
governmental,
so
close
to
that
national
league
of
cities
core,
that
congress'
spending
power
could
not
even
have
conditions
imposed.
but
it
does
seem
clear
that
nothing
in
the
commerce
clause
prevents
the
city
from
using
these
federal
dollars
as
it
was
intended
that
they
be
used.
now,
with
respect
to
the
public
works
projects
themselves,
i
think
it
is
conceded
all,
around
and
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
been
conceded
by
the
court
below,
that
if
the
public
works
jobs...
the
jobs
rebuilding
streets
and
parks
and
maybe
little
city
halls...
if
they
were
filled
through
direct
hiring
by
the
city,
if
the
city
set
up
a
bureaucracy
to
do
public
works
construction,
then
the
preference
for
residents
as
employees
of
the
city
would
be
constitutional
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
such
as
mccarthy
against
philadelphia
civil
service
commission
in
1976.
indeed,
i
think
that
a
fair
implication,
justice
brennan,
of
your
shapiro
opinion
was
that
residency
requirements
for
welfare
would
be
perfectly
acceptable;
it
was
only
the
durational
residency
requirement
that
was...
that
was
a
difficulty.
so
the
problem
here
seems
to
be
that
rather
than
setting
up
an
unwieldy
bureaucracy
to
hire
public
works
groups,
the
city
has
actually
created
a
market
for
private
firms
to
do
some
of
that
public
works
construction.
and
it
is
said
by
the
court
below
that
when
the
hiring
operates
through
private
firms
rather
than
directly,
that
somehow
that
removes
whatever
immunity
the
city
might
have.
frankly,
i
fail
to
understand
why
that
should
be.
i
can
understand
how
in
a
case
like
hickland
the
fact
that
the
state
of
alaska
tried
to
use
its
hold
over
a
scarce
and
important
national
resource
like
oil
and
gas
to
kind
of
trickle
out
into
the
entire
private
economy
so
that
anyone
who
even
supplied
something
to
a
subcontractor
who
had
anything
to
do
with
the
ripple
effect
of
the
alaskan
oil
and
gas
was
suddenly
trapped
by
the
preference.
but
nothing
like
that
is
happening
here.
subcontractors
are
included
only
to
make
sure
that
every
single
job
on
the
project
is
covered.
it
really
is
not
a
matter
of
concern,
i
would
think,
to
the
federal
constitution
how
many
links
there
are
in
the
chain
of
command
between
the
city
of
boston
and
the
people
who
work
on
the
site
and--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
extension
of
the
subcontractors
and
the
use
of
private
firms
in
no
way
broadens
the
power
that
the
city
is
asserting
here.
it
is
a
vertical
extension
and
not
a
horizontal
one.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
what
does
it
take
to
be
a
resident
of
boston?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if
you
move
there
at
the
time
the
job
starts,
and
you
sign
a
form
saying
that
you
intend
to
live
there,
i
think
the
test
of
domicile
is
met.
i
don't
think
that
the
enforcement
problem
has
been
very
serious,
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
think
if
they
said,
we
intend
to
leave
when
the
job
was
done,
they
would
not
be
residents.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's
the
intention
to
make
it
your
place
of
domicile.
and
i
would
think
that
evidence
that
they
intended
to
vote
tomorrow,
for
example,
back
in
new
hampshire
would
be
used
to
prove
that
they
were
not
local
residents,
or
indeed
that
they
intended
to
vote
in
the
springfield
election
tomorrow.
and
that's
another
point
that
i
think
it's
crucial
to
stress.
even
if
we
were
talking
about
something
to
which
the
limits
of
the
commerce
clause
were
to
apply,
we
are
not
dealing
here
in
any
sense
with
an
attempt
by
boston
to
target
any
discrimination
against
out-of-staters.
of
the
non-bostonians
who
were
adversely
affected
in
any
potential
way
by
this
order
in
the
period
from
1978
to
1980,
94
percent
were
from
the
state
of
massachusetts,
only
6
percent
were
from
outside
massachusetts.
and
of
those
who
were
outside
massachusetts,
only
half
could
even
potentially
been
affected;
the
other
half
were
on
work
crews
that
already
had
at
least
50
percent
bostonians.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
black,
that
would
certainly
be
harder.
let
me
tell
you
why
i
think
there's
a
difference.
we
are
not
maintaining
that
building
borders
around
cities
is
immune
to
commerce
clause
scrutiny.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
certainly,
building
a
border
around
the
state
would
be
subject
to
commerce
clause
immunity
if
it
applied
to
the
whole
public...
whole
private
sector.
we're
talking
here
not
about
any
construction,
we're
talking
about
conserving
the
state's
resources
as
it
might
conserve
welfare
resources
or
public
jobs.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
why
might
i
think
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
reason,
i
think,
justice
white,
that
it
would
is
that
the
framework
of
the
constitution
on
this
subject
represents
a...
an
accommodation
between
two
importantly
different
ideas.
one
is
the
idea
that
we
are,
after
all,
a
single
nation.
we
must
sink
or
swim
together.
the
other,
however,
is
the
idea
that
we
are
not
a
single
nation
governed
only
from
washington
with
states
and
cities
being
just
little
departments
of
that
nation.
that
is,
what
it
means
to
be
a
state
or
a
city
is
to
be
able
to
pool
one's
collective
efforts
and
make
a
collective
sacrifice
through
taxation
or
make
a
collective
exertion
to
get
federal
money,
and
to
use
the
public
goods
generated
by
those
public
efforts
in
a
way
that
prefers
one's
own
constituents.
we
really
wouldn't
find
quasi-sovereign
entities
like
cities
and
states
making
massive
exertions
if
the
moment
they
had
public
schools
they
automatically
had
to
be
open
to
everyone
in
the
country
who
wanted
to
travel
there,
if
the
moment
they
had
a
welfare
plan
more
generous
than
someone
else's
that
residence
couldn't
be
a
qualification.
that
is
the
reason
that
the
conception
of
at
least
quasi-sovereign
entities
like
cities
and
states
suggests
that
public
goods,
public
jobs,
public
works
employment,
public
welfare,
can
be
reserved
completely,
i
would
say,
but
certainly
to
the
extent
of
50
percent--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--to
citizens.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
would
suppose
the
closest
cases
are
mccarthy
against
civil
service
commission;
califano
v.
torres,
to
some
extent;
doe
v.
boulton
in
1978,
suggesting
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
limiting
the
general
medical
care
available
in
a
state
to
residents
and
limiting
public
medical
facilities
to
residents;
probably
also
the
montana
elk
case,
to
a
degree...
that
is,
the
chief
justice--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
certainly--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
thought
you...
closer
to
the
general
theory,
reeves
and
hughes
not
only
help,
we
think
this
is
case
is
a
fortiori.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
oh,
i
am
sorry,
justice
white.
i
thought--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
guess
i
was
strengthening--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
they
support
the
result.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
support
the
result,
and
i
am
interested
in
the
result
as
well
as
in
the
theory.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that
it's
the
kind
of
balkanization
congress
seemed
to
think
would
solve
local
unemployment
problems.
so
it
doesn't
scare
me
any
more
than
it
scared
this
court
on
the
prudential
case.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
pardon?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
the
constitution's
concept
of
balkanization
draws
a
line
at
the...
sort
of
at
the
water's
edge
of
an
individual
community's
collecting
their
effort
to
make
public
goods
available
to
public
citizens.
in
hughes
v.
alexandria
scrap,
for
example,
i
think
it's
important
that
every
member
of
the
court,
including
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
hughes
case,
took
it
as
an
axiom
that
of
course
the
state
of
maryland
could
take
steps
designed
to
make
sure
that
it
was
not
extending
its
money
cleaning
up
the
virginia
environment,
that
it
could
reserve
its
public
money
to
clean
up
the
maryland
environment.
there
was
a
question
whether
the
way
it
did
it
might
have
violated
the
commerce
clause.
and
the
court
understandably
divided
on
that
question.
but
there
is
no
question
that
it's
permissible
for
cities
and
states
to
collect
their
effort
and
take
the
public
goods
that
they
generate
that
way
and
reserve
them
for
their
own
citizens.
but
let
me
assume
for
a
moment
that
we
lost
that
issue,
that
the
court
were
to
say
that
this
is
not
immune.
it
seems
to
me
very
clear,
and
i
want
to
make
the
point
briefly
before
taking
up--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
talk
about,
justice
brennan.
first
of
all,
it's
important
to
note
that
the
state
supreme
court,
in
not
finding
any
violation
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
noted
that
the
law
here
did
not
aim...
the
executive
order...
did
not
aim
solely
or
chiefly
at
out-of-state
residents.
that
makes
a
difference.
this
court
has
never
held
the
privileges
ad
immunities
clause
would
apply--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right.
and
in
fact,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
those
supposedly
hurt
are
residents
of
massachusetts.
more
fundamentally,
the
right--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--in
the...
which
of
the
alaska
cases?
you
mean
zobell
v.
williams?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
guess
though
justice
o'connor
did
have
a
theory
about
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
which
would
have
made
it
apply
even
to
internal
discrimination,
your
opinion
for
the
court
did
not
rely
on
privileges
and
immunities,
and
specifically
didn't
on
the
ground
that
it
applies
only
to
discrimination
against
residents
of
other
states.
but
i
was
going
to
say
one
other
thing
about
privileges
and
immunities.
and
that
is
that
the
right
to
share
in
a
city's
public
largesse
or
a
state's
public
largesse
in
the
form
of
public
jobs
in
a
case
like
mccarthy
or
welfare
in
a
case
like
shapiro,
has
never
been
held
to
be
one
of
those
things
that
must
be
shared
equally
regardless
of
residency.
we
do
not
believe
the
privileges
or
immunities
clause
has
any
application
at
all
to
this
case,
for
those
reasons.
and
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
a
couple
of
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
as
to
the
impact
on
commerce,
i
do
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
the
record
did
not
really
leave
it
so
ambiguous.
the
court
below
recognized
that
the
provisions
may
have
little
impact
on
the
industry
or
on
its
functioning
in
interstate
commerce.
it's
just
some
firms
that
might
be
affected.
i
think
it's
clear
from
justice
white's
questions,
and
he
may
have
been
recalling
exxon
v.
maryland,
that
adverse
impact
on
some
firms
is
not
a
constitutionally
cognizable
commerce
clause
violation.
and
i
just
want
to
remind
the
court
that,
even
if
there
were
adverse
impact
on
commerce,
we've
argued
that
that
impact
would
be
amply
justified.
moreover,
the
record
is
clear
that
the
data
stipulated
at
page
a-44,
the
data
as
to
one
month,
december
1978,
are
representative.
and
in
that
one
month
93
percent
of
the
firms
would
have
been
wholly
unaffected
by
the
order.
none
of
the
7
percent
that
were
affected
were
from
out
of
state.
i
don't
think
there's
a
viable
commerce
clause
objection
here.
i
think
there
also
are
some
confusions
that
respondents
have
spawned
with
respect
to
the
federally
funded
part
of
all
this.
justice
white
asked,
isn't
it
true
that
the
city
signs
the
checks.
i
just
want
to
say,
it's
entirely
true.
this
is
the
city's
month.
in
the
copley
place
project,
for
example,
to
say
that
there's
no
risk
assumed
by
the
city
would
be
rather
fanciful.
as
our
reply
brief
points
out
at
footnote
11,
the
grant
is
to
the
city,
the
city
has
simply
loaned
the
money
to
the
developer,
and
if
it
fails
the
city's
loan
becomes
no
good.
we're
told
in
some
vague
way
that
there
are
other
federal
regulations,
maybe
of
the
department
of
transportation,
that
might
be
violated
here.
i
haven't
heard
that
since
the
complaint
in
this
case,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
dot
regulations
just
specify
that
there
should
be
no
discrimination
against
out
of
staters.
and
the
supreme
judicial
court
in
this
case,
as
its
reason
for
not
finding
a
violation
of
privileges
and
immunities,
said
that
it's
clear
that
neither
on
its
face
nor
in
fact
is
this
aimed
chiefly
at
out
of
staters.
mr.
kingston
says
that
there's
something
in
the
executive
order
before
this
court
that
makes
the
order
apply
whenever
the
city
goes
out
and
applies
for
federal
money.
that's
not
true.
it's
just
not
what
the
order
says.
what
the
order
says
is,
the
city
must
be
a
signatory
to
the
construction
contract,
which
it
sometimes
is
as
to
these
federal
funds,
but
not
always.
the
federal
regulations
have
not
been
amended
since
we
filed
our
brief.
you
can
rely
on
the
version
that
we
have.
and
in
fact,
the
statute
does
not
say
what
the
respondents
claim
it
says.
12
u.s.
code
section
1701(u)
does
not
require
that
the
city
become
the
employer
of
last
resort
and
target
the
money
at
the
unemployed.
it
says
specifically
that
the
jobs
assisted
under
the
program
be
given
to
lower
income
persons
residing
within
the
unit
of
government
or
the
metropolitan
area.
so
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
the
regulations
are
complied
with
here.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
be
if
we
were
throwing
other
bodies
out
of
work.
but
the
point
is
that
the
money
that's
being
used
to
generate
two
jobs
gives
one
job...
that
money
may
come
from
the
defense
department
for
all
i
know.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
many
jobs
it
would
create
in
its
other
uses.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
comes
from
the
federal
treasury
in
part,
but
a
fifth
of
it
under
the
law
has
to
be
matched
by
the
city,
and
a
lot
of
it
is
directly
raised
from
city
residents.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
not
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
does
have
bearing
on
congress'
power
to
target
the
money
to
the
city
that
applies,
which
it
surely
can
do
despite
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
unless
it
is
suggested
by
an
extension
of
this
privity
concept
that
the
fact
that
the
money
gets
to
bostonians
through
the
boston
somehow
changes
the
fact,
and
i
don't
think
that
can
change
anything,
any
more
than
it
can
change
the
right
of
the
city
to
prefer
bostonians
in
the
building
of
schools
that
it
actually
does
something
so
strange
as
hiring
private
firm
to
build
it.
i
don't
think
the
constitution
is
violated
here.
