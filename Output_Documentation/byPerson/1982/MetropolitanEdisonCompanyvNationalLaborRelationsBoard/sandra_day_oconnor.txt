justice
sandra

o'connor
may
i
ask
you
on
the
arbitration
point,
the
arbitration
clause
in
the
contract
that
was
in
effect
said
that
a
decision
by
an
arbitrator
shall
be
binding
for
the
term
of
this
agreement.
was
that
same
clause
in
the
preceding
agreements
at
the
time
that
the
arbitrations
were
made?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
have
a
bearing
on
your
arbitration
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
arbitrator
back
in
the
previous
arbitrations
had
to
be
interpreting
the
terms
of
the
contract
to
decide
whether
the
greater
punishment
could
be
issued
or
whether
there
were
greater
duties
or
whether
there
was
a
waiver?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
the
decisions
of
the
arbitrators
in
these
two
instances
were
not
complete
enough
to
let
us
know
what
the
arbitrator
was
really
basing
it
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
could
he
have
looked
at
other
than
the
no-strike
clause,
do
you
think,
to
determine
that
there
had
been
a
waiver
or--
