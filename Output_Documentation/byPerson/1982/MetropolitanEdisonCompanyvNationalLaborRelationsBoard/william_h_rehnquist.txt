justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
sileo,
in
your
petition
you
raise
a
second
question
that
i
take
is
independent
of
the
arbitration
problem.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
is
the
waiver
issue?
i
realize
justice
o'connor
mentioned
it.
i
am
not
sure
i
understand.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
just
describe
it
and
if--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--once
you
sign
a
contract,
you're
bound
to
carry
it
out.
i
don't
see
that
as
being
a
waiver
problem.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
it--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
they
didn't
carry
out
the
request
that
management
made
to
them
as
the
manner...
as
the
manner
in
which
management
wanted
that
done.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
board--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--okay.
but
what
the
company
wants
to
do
here
is
discipline
them
more
than--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
rank-and-file.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
come--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
you
will
slow
down
a
minute
and
wait
for
me.
does
the
board
make
any
distinction
between
an
act
of
management
in
disciplining
union
leaders
which
is
intended
as
a
subterfuge
by
management
to
simply
get
at
the
union
leaders
and
penalize
them
for
being
union
leaders
on
the
one
hand,
and
an
effort
by
management
to
treat
union
leaders
as
being
more
responsible
than
rank-and-file
for
the
strike
because
they
are
union
leaders
and
you
expect
that
of
someone
who
is
the
head
of
an
organization?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
assume
you
don't
prove
that,
though?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
mr.
come--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
come.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
the
board
agrees
that
particular
contractual
provisions
could
do
it,
and
all
the
management
here
is
contending
is
that
an
arbitrator's
construction
of
a
contract
should
also
permit
it.
now,
ought
the
board
to
get
where
it
concedes
that
a
particular
type
of
contract
can
produce
the
result?
is
it
really
the
province
of
the
board
to
get
into
the
business
of
interpreting
contracts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
before
you
get
to
the
waiver
issue,
i
presume
you
have
to
have
some
finding
of
a
violation
of
the
provision.
does
the
board
interpret
the
section
8(a)(3)
where
it
terms
about
discrimination
in
regard
to
higher
tenure
of
employment
to
mean
that
any
difference
in
treatment
at
all
between
union
officials
and
union
rank-and-file
by
management
is
a
violation
of
that
section
and
therefore
you
must
get
to
the
waiver
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
not
at
all
based
on
bad
motive
or
on--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
before
you
get
to
that
question
you
have
the
question
of
whether
the
board
was
warranted
in
finding
there
was
an
8(a)(3)
violation
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
is
your
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
four
courts
of
appeals
have
agreed
with
the
board?
