justice
byron
r.
white
was
lang
an
employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
participate
in
the
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
is
a
signal
to
other
employees
that
it
is
perfectly
all
right
to
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
didn't...
he
didn't
cross
the
picket
line
and
anybody--
justice
byron
r.
white
--anybody
else
could
say,
well,
here's
the
union
boss
not
going
to
work,
he
is
observing
the
picket
line,
why
shouldn't
i?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
leadership?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
board
actually
addressed
straight
that
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
is
an
issue
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
come,
wouldn't
the
court
also
sustain
usually
the
next
arbitrator
who
decided
the
issue
exactly
contrary
to
the
first
arbitrator?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
one
arbitrator
isn't
bound
by
another,
is
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
court
would
probably
sustain
them
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
come,
i
suppose
it's
hard
to
figure
out
how
you
could
discipline
the
union
as
distinguished
from
its
leadership
in
a
case
like
this.
but
i
suppose
you'd
make
the
same
arguments,
you
couldn't
discipline
the
union
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
is
some
back
pay
involved
somehow
or
other,
it
might--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
that's
absent
a
showing.
i
just--
justice
byron
r.
white
--would
it
be
a
showing
enough
if
the
union
as
a
union
didn't
take
some
affirmative
steps?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
must
cross
the
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
a
legal
line,
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
a
line
that
if
they
didn't
cross,
it
was
in
breach
of
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
wouldn't
another
arbitrator
be
perfectly
free
to
disregard
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know,
but
the
parties
are
also
operating
under
the
federal
law,
and
if
a
second
arbitrator
can
disregard
the
first
and
interpret
the
contract
as
not
waiving,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
waiving
the
rights
of
union
officers,
why
shouldn't
the
national
labor
relations
board
be
able
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
should
the
board
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
should
the
board
do
if
two
arbitrators
disagree
as
to
what
the
contract
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
contract
had
been
renewed
two
or
three
times--
justice
byron
r.
white
--after
these
arbitration
decisions?
justice
byron
r.
white
two
or
three
times--
