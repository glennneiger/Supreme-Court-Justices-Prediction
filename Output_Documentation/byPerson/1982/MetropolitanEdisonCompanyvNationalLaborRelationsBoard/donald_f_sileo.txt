mr.
donald
f.
sileo
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
case
is
about
two
union
officers,
david
lang
and
eugene
light,
who
participated
in
an
unlawful
strike
at
three
mile
island
on
august
30,
1977.
the
immediately
apparent
issue
is
whether
petitioner
was
justified
in
relying
upon
two
prior
arbitration
decisions
between
the
parties.
those
arbitration
decisions
imposed
upon
union
officers
greater
duties
than
those
imposed
upon
rank-and-file
employees;
namely,
not
only
not
to
participate
in
the
strike
but
to
urge
others
from
participating
in
the
strike.
for
breach
of
those
duties
the
union
officers
could
be
disciplined
more
severely
than
the
rank-and-file
employees,
according
to
the
arbitration
decisions.
here
lang
and
light
received
25
days'
suspensions
from
employment
and
the
others
up
to
10
days'
suspension
from
employment.
i
describe
that
issue
as
the
immediately
apparent
one
because
there
are
two
fundamental,
far-reaching
issues
under
federal
labor
law
as
to
the
impact
of
this
case
generally
throughout
this
country
on
the
no-strike
promises
in
various
contracts,
and
virtually
all
contracts,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
on
the
vitality
of
arbitration.
first
of
all,
should
the
national
labor
relations
board
be
allowed
to
marshal
all
its
weaponry
in
blatant
interference
with
the
collective
bargaining
process,
thereby
relieving
the
union
of
the
full
scope
of
its
no-strike
clause
obligation?
if
the
labor
board
is
successful
in
this,
it
will
eviscerate
what
little
is
left
of
what
has
already
been
called
the
largely
chimerical
and
illusory
remedies
that
are
available
to
an
employer
for
violation
of
a
no-strike
clause.
that
no-strike
promise,
as
this
court
well
knows,
is
the
most
important
promise
that
a
union
makes
to
the
employer,
particularly
important,
i
might
add,
to
this
public
utility
employer,
that
not
only
operates
a
nuclear
site
but
has
24
hours
a
day
continuous
service
in
all
its
operations,
as
is
noted
and
acknowledged
in
several
different
places
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
second
vital
long-range
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
the
national
labor
relations
board
should
be
allowed
to
dangerously
erode
this
court's
steelworkers
trilogy
cases
or
whether
that
foundation
of
industrial
peace
will
remain
unshaken.
this
case
has
generated
widespread
interest
throughout
the
entire
country.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
and
that
second
issue
is
whether
independent
of
arbitration
there
is
a
higher
duty
on
rank-and-file
employees
irrespective
of
whether
there
have
been
arbitration
decisions.
justice
rehnquist,
i
recognize
this
court's
disinclination
to
make
decisions
on
the
broadest
possible
basis.
we
think
that
our
case
is
very
strong
on
the
point
you
raised
as
well
as
on
the
arbitration
point.
we
have
concentrated
on
the
arbitration
point
because
we
think
we
have
the
very
strongest
case
in
that
area.
but
we
certainly
are
not
running
away
from
the
operation
of
law
argument
which
we
raise
in
our
briefs
and
which
the
amici
raise
in
their
briefs;
namely,
that
there
is
a
duty
arising
out
of
their
positions.
and
certainly
there
have
been
three
members
of
the
labor
board
in
recent
years
that
have
adhered
to
that
position,
and
there
is
a
body
of
arbitral
authority
that
adheres
to
that
position.
but
if
i
may
return
to
the
thrust
of
the
arbitration
argument,
the
brief
background
with
respect
to
this
case
is
that
in
september
1980
the
national
labor
relations
board
handed
down
its
decision,
which
was
consistent
with
the
per
se
precision
castings
rule,
which
was
short-lived
namely,
that
disciplining
union
officers
more
severely
than
rank-and-file
employees
was
in
and
of
itself
discriminatory,
a
violation,
and
they
treated
as
irrelevant
the
arbitration
decisions.
in
november
of
1981
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
per
se
approach
of
precision
castings,
but
nevertheless
found
against
petitioner,
holding
that
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
greater
duty
it
must
be
in
the
precise
language,
those
greater
duties
for
the
union
officers
must
be
in
the
precise
language
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
document
itself.
and
the
third
circuit
discounted
the
arbitration
decisions
that
petitioner
had
relied
upon.
there
have
been
some
recent
cases
in
this
area
of
the
law.
one
of
them
handed
down
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
was
consolidation
coal.
there
were
five
board
members,
at
that
time
anyway.
there
are
four
now;
there
will
be
two
new
appointments
within
a
few
months.
this
whole
area
is
in
a
state
of
flux
as
far
as
the
labor
board
is
concerned.
those
five
board
members
handed
down
four
opinions.
those
opinions,
i
think,
are
fairly
summarized
in
the
board's
brief
at
pages
32
and
33,
footnote
16.
in
effect,
the
labor
board
decision...
a
majority
of
the
members
at
least...
abandon
the
per
se
precision
castings
approach.
recently,
in
the
fifth
circuit
a
court
in
south
central
bell
agreed
with
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
metropolitan
edison.
contrarywise,
in
february
of
1982
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
fournelle
case,
written
by
judge
harry
t.
edwards,
who
has
labor
expertise
and
recognition
throughout
the
country.
in
that
decision
judge
edwards
found
that
where
under
similar
circumstances
to
these
there
had
been
a
prior
arbitration
decision,
that
prior
arbitration
decision
had
imposed
greater
duties
upon
union
officers
than
rank-and-file
employees,
the
kinds
of
duties
that
we
have
in
this
case
here,
those
kinds
of
greater
duties.
under
those
circumstances,
the
circuit
court,
district
of
columbia,
found
that
the
union
officers
might
be
disciplined
more
severely
and
found
further
that
when
a
subsequent
case
arose
in
this
general
area...
namely,
involving
union
officers
being
disciplined
more
severely
during
an
unlawful
strike...
we
had
a
contractual
claim
case.
we
no
longer
had
an
unfair
labor
practice
case.
we
had,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
the
labor
board
"meddling
in
the
legitimate
products
of
the
collective
bargaining
process.
"
judge
edwards
relied
very
heavily
upon
this
court's
steelworkers
trilogy
cases,
and
particularly
the
warrior
case
where
this
court
said
that
arbitration
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
collective
bargaining
process,
where
this
court
said--
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
--yes.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
that
clause
has
remained
the
same,
justice
o'connor,
throughout
the
life
of
these
parties
for
the
term
of
this
agreement.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
we
think
not
at
all,
justice
o'connor.
we
think
that
a
case
of
this
magnitude
certainly
should
not
turn
on
a
phrase
for
the
term
of
the
agreement
which
appears
as
surplusage
throughout
the
agreement
in
a
number
of
different
provisions,
7.8,
7.9,
7.10,
1.5,
the
very
recognition
clause
that
wherein
the
metropolitan
edison
recognizes
the
union
and
agrees
that
it
will
not...
that
it
will
not
bargain
with
any
other
union
during...
at
the
conclusion
of
the
agreement.
we
think
that
it
is
just
surplusage.
we
think
further
that
the
union
has
in
effect
conceded
that
because
in
the
second
arbitration
decision...
namely,
the
seidenberg
decision...
there
was
no
challenge
to
the
first
arbitration
decision
on
that
basis,
justice
o'connor.
in
the
alderfer
decision
about
which
we
wrote...
namely,
that
decision
in
which
the
arbitrator
had
said
that
a
refusal
to
cross
a
picket
line
was
a
violation
of
the
contract...
in
that
decision
there
was
a
subsequent
challenge,
i
should
say,
before
the
national
labor
relations
board,
there
was
a
stipulation
that
a
refusal
to
cross
the
picket
line,
as
in
this
case,
represented
an
unlawful
strike.
that
is
contrary
to
board
law,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
there
is
u.s.
steel
and
cases
that
have
been
cited
in
the
board's
brief
to
that
effect.
and
yet
the
union
recognized
that
refusal
to
cross
a
picket
line
in
the
context
of
these
parties
was
a
violation.
surely,
the
reason
why
it
recognized
it
is
because
of
the
aldefer
award
back
in
1972...
early
'73,
i
should
say.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
that
makes
very
clear
that
the
union
recognized
all
of
these
decisions
as
having
a
continuing
effect.
all
that...
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
were
for
the
term
of
the
agreement.
this
was
simply
repeating
that
which
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
agreement.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
the
arbitrator
interpreted
the
terms
of
the
contract
and
took
into
consideration,
as
this
court
admonished
arbitrators
to
do,
industrial
common
law.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
well,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
arbitrator
definitely
did
refer
to
industrial
common
law.
however,
we
can
presume
that
the
arbitrator
certainly
took
into
effect
11.1,
the
no-strike
clause.
and
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
further
presume
that
the
arbitrator--
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
--well,
i...
that...
one
of
our
points,
of
course,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
he
didn't
have
to
determine
there
was
a
waiver,
he
determined
that
there
was
a
contractual
violation.
okay.
there
was
a
contractual
violation.
and
in
making
that
determination,
he
took
into
account,
we
contend,
11.1,
the
no-strike
clause;
12.2,
the
responsibility
of
the
international;
9.4
the
additional
rights
that
union
officers
have
under
the
contract;
the
continuous
service
provisions,
2.7,
6.4(a)
and
6.3(a);
all
those
continuous
service
provisions
which
underline
how
important
it
was
for
this
employer
to
have
such
continuous
service.
and
yes,
the
industrial
common
law,
as
this
court
said
in
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
in
warrior,
industrial
common
law
certainly
is
something
to
be
looked
at.
but
it
is
our
contention,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
waiver
issue
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
it
is
our
contention
that
this
is
a
contractual
claim
case,
barring
the
issue
that
justice
rehnquist
raised
as
to
operation
of
law.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
well,
i
prefer
not
having
to
make
their
case
in
bringing
up
what
the
waiver
issue
is.
however--
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
--yes.
what
they're
contending,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
at
the
time...
at
the
time
wayne
howard,
the
arbitrator
in
this
case
in
1973,
came
down
with
his
decision
and
at
the
time
of
the
seidenberg
decisions
a
couple
of
years
later,
that
those
decisions
didn't
constitute
a
waiver
of
the
statutory
right
which
the
labor
board
and
the
unions
see
in
this
case.
we
see
no
statutory
right
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
okay.
well,
of
course,
that's...
our
point
is
that
this
is
a
contractual
claim
case
and
not
a
statutory
right
case.
our
claim
is
that
in
order
to
have
a
statutory
right
case,
you
have
to
have
disparate
discipline,
and
this
is
not
disparate
discipline...
i
mean
you
have
to
have
disparate
discipline
of
like
cases,
of
individuals
similarly
situated.
we
don't
have
similarly
situated
individuals.
the
contract
was
interpreted
by
the
arbitrators
as
making
very
clear
that
we
did
not...
we
do
not
have
similarly
situated
individuals.
returning
to
the
analysis
of
the
fournelle
decision,
i
think
i
have
finished.
there
was
a
follow-up
to
the
fournelle
decision,
a
case
which
i
shall
mispronounce
as
szewczuga.
but
it
involved
miller
brewing,
in
any
event,
which
is
easier
to
pronounce.
in
that
case
the
court
in
no
way,
the
circuit
court,
district
of
columbia,
in
no
way
departed
from
the
fournelle
holding.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
no
arbitration
decision
introduced
in
that
case.
and
the
circuit
court,
district
of
columbia,
in
that
case
clearly
demarcated
its
difference
from
the
third
circuit.
in
this
case
this
court,
consistent
with
its
teachings,
can
promote
the
national
labor
policy
of
industrial...
of
encouraging
industrial
peace
through
the
collective
bargaining
process,
including
arbitration,
and
it
can
do
so
without
infringing
upon
the
functions
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
that
board
altogether
too
frequently
takes
a
parochial
view
of
its
own
functions.
it
was
admonished
not
to
do
so
in
a
different
context,
albeit
a
different
context,
but
in
a
language
that
is
landmark
language
of
this
court
in
southern
steamship.
it
was
told
to
accommodate
itself.
in
this
case,
we
submit,
the
labor
board
should
accommodate
itself
to
arbitration.
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
there
is...
because
there
is
a
contractual
claim
rather
than
an
unfair
labor
practice
issue,
that
makes
inapposite
respondent's
reliance
upon
authority
which,
in
turn,
cites
this
court's
decisions
in
acme,
strong,
c&c
plywood,
and
carey.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
those
holdings
do
not
govern
this
situation,
and
there
is
language
in
those
holdings
which
we
have
cited
at
page
29
of
our
principal
brief
and
pages
8
and
9
of
our
reply
brief,
which
are
helpful
to
us
in
this
particular
case.
the
contractual
claim
here
was
settled
in
may
of
1973
when
wayne
howard,
the
first
arbitrator,
came
down
with
his
decision
imposing
greater
duties
upon
union
officers.
that
remained
the
law
of
the
parties,
the
law
of
that
shop,
unless
reversed
in
negotiations
or
by
a
subsequent
arbitrator.
not
only
was
it
not
reversed
by
a
subsequent
arbitrator,
it
was
reaffirmed
by
a
subsequent
arbitrator.
it
was
also
reaffirmed
by
the
union
in
various
ways.
the
very
same
two
union
officers
involved
in
this
dispute
four
years
before
had
involvement
in
another
unfair
labor
practice
strike.
in
october
of
1973
lang
and
light
participated
in
an
unlawful
strike.
they
were
disciplined
more
severely
at
that
time,
just
as
they
were
disciplined
four
years
later
in
this
case.
for
their
increased
discipline,
they
did
not
grieve.
they
sat
on
the
union
executive
committee.
in
the
capacity
of
the
union
executive
committee's
members,
they
were
the
ones
entrusted,
according
to
lang's
testimony,
they
were
the
ones
entrusted
with
the
responsibility
of
determining
whether
or
not
they
should
grieve
their
own
cases
and
other
cases.
lang
testified
at
the
joint
appendix,
the
brown
one,
at
page
92
that
they
took
into
the
grievance
machinery
and
arbitration
cases
they
liked,
quote,
liked.
they
didn't
take
their
own
cases.
as
long
ago
as
october
of
1973
they
recognized
that
they
were
bound
by
the
may
'73
arbitration
award.
they
took
other
cases.
in
december
of
1974
there
was
yet
another
unlawful
strike.
following
that
unlawful
strike,
in
which
union
officers
were
disciplined
more
severely,
there
was
an
arbitration
hearing
in
september
of
1975
before
arbitrator
jacob
seidenberg.
at
the
time
of
that
hearing
there
was
no
challenge
by
the
union
to
the
fact
of
the
duties.
the
only
challenge
was
as
to
whether
the
particular
union
officers
had
fulfilled
their
duties.
and
arbitrator
seidenberg
found
that
in
a
couple
of
instances
they
had
fulfilled
their
howard
duties...
although
he
did
not
use
the
word
"howard
duties",
clearly
he
was
talking
about
the
same
duties...
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
found
that
the
union
was
correct
in
those
instances.
in
the
other
instance
involving
union
officer
participating
in
the
unlawful
strike,
the
arbitrator
seidenberg,
the
second
arbitrator,
rubber-stamped
the
first
arbitrator,
wayne
howard.
now,
it's...
it's
our
contention
that
those
facts,
the
prior
involvement
of
lang
and
light,
their
recognizing
the
howard
decision,
the
subsequent
arbitration
and
the
facts
leading
up
to
that,
the
fact
that
the
union
didn't
challenge
in
the
arbitration
decision,
that
was
further
rubber-stamping
the
original
decision.
there
were
two
renegotiations.
there
was
no
attempt
made
during
those
renegotiations
to
change
the
howard
decision.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
seidenberg
decision
occurred
before
the
second
of
the
negotiations,
and
arising
from
the
second
negotiations
the
contract
was
signed
on
behalf
of
this
union
by
the
very
same
two
individuals,
lang
and
light.
and
we
submit
that
when
they
signed
that
contract
including
that
no-strike
clause,
they
were
signing
and
rubber-stamping
the
howard
decision
which
they
themselves
had
had
a
party
in
in
october
of
'73
by
not
challenging
those
duties
that
were
imposed.
we
have
said
that
in
this
case
it
would...
this
case
could
dangerously
erode
the
steelworkers
trilogy.
and
the
reason
why
we
say
that
is
because
if
respondents
prevail
in
this
case,
it
would
mean
that
arbitration
is
not
what
this
court
said
it
was:
the
terminal
point
of
disagreement.
indeed,
it
would
allow
the
union
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
the
union
could
take
advantage
of...
and
i
mean
not
to
impugn
the
labor
board,
but
it
is
certainly
not
unknown
for
them
to
change
their
policies,
and
if
i
may
use
the
word,
there
is
some
waffling
that
has
gone
on
in
many
areas
of
law,
including
this,
because
as
i
am
sure
you
are
familiar
from
reading
the
briefs
in
this
area
of
the
law,
prior
to
1977,
justice
rehnquist's
question
about
whether
or
not
it
was
necessary
to
have
the
arbitration
decision
in
order
for
us
to
prevail.
in
effect,
that
was
the
question
that
was
asked,
or
whether
there
was
a
second
issue.
at
that
time,
prior
to
1977,
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
held
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
have
an
arbitration
decision
or
duties
spelled
out.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
sufficient
that
there
were
union
officers
and
greater...
and
greater
duties
were
presumed
and
greater
penalties
could
be
imposed.
and
in
spite
of
the
board's
attempt
to
say
that
that
was
not
the
clear
rule
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
before
1977.
indeed
it
was.
in
any
event,
there
has
been
waffling
by
the
board
on
many
issues,
and
there
certainly
would
be...
certainly
could
be
in
the
future.
a
party
can
come
in
and
collaterally
attack...
and
that
is
what
is
being
done
here...
collaterally
attack
decisions
of
the
parties,
arbitration
decisions
that
are
four
years
old,
and
by
collaterally
attacking
those
decisions,
have
them
set
aside
because
the
board's
position
has
changed.
and
by
having
them
set
aside,
that
would
cause
the
party
that
had
prevailed
in
those
arbitration
decisions
to
have
been
deprived
of
its
bargain,
a
bargain
that
it
may
well
have
relied
upon
as
here,
as
here
as
part
of
its
no-strike
obligation
and
in
other
contexts
as
part
of
some
other
obligation.
and
they
may
have
made
concessions
during
the
course
of
negotiations
based
upon
that.
they
may
well
have
made
withdrawals
of
demands
based
upon
what
they
regarded
as
settled
arbitral
construction.
instead,
the
labor
board's
changing
fancy
can
be
taken
advantage
of
by
an
opportunistic
party
which
would
cause
that
settled
arbitral
construction
to
be
set
aside
and
which
would
further
cause
the
windfall
to
the
opportunistic
party
which
this
court
in
its
separate
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
in
magnovox
sought
to
avoid.
the
labor
board,
by
collaterally
attacking
settled
arbitral
construction
of
the
contract,
violated
congress'
dual
admonitions
at
section
203(d)
of
the
act
that
final
adjustment
of
grievance
disputes
is
desirable
by
a
method
agreed
upon
by
the
parties
and
to
avoid
industrial
strife.
their
approach
can
only
result
in
causing
industrial
strife.
they
are
attempting
to
straitjacket
us...
and
when
i
say
"us",
i
mean
management
in
general
and
metropolitan
edison
in
this
case...
in
inapplicable
statutory
rights
and
in
phantom
waiver
rights.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
yes,
i
do.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
think
it
important
to
note
that
contrary
to
the
heist
situation,
which
was
quoted
or
referred
to
by
mr.
cohen,
the
union
officers
in
this
case
made
no
effort
whatsoever
during
the
strike
to
be
of
any
help.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
contrary-wise,
they
refused
to
cross
the
picket
line
in
spite
of
being
told
to
do
so
repeatedly,
in
spite
of
being
told
that
they
would
be
in
big
trouble.
and
at
one
point
union
officer
lang
contemptuously
said,
listen,
if
we
cross
this
picket
line
of
the
operating
engineers
and
next
year
we
have
our
own
picket
line
during
negotiations,
well,
they'll
cross
our
picket
line.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
that
shows
a
contemptuous
disregard
of
their
duties.
throughout
the
strike
there
was
no
effort
made
to
be
of
help.
prior
to
the
strike,
the
fact
that
they
spoke
to
the
rank-and-file
membership
and
they
sought
to
have
the
rank-and-file
members
cooperate
in
the
event
there
would
be
a
similar
incident
to
that
which
occurred
on
october
4th,
where
there
was
a
refusal
to
cross
a
picket
line,
their
efforts
prior
to
august
30th,
if
anything,
demonstrate
that
the
union
officers
recognized
they
had
a
duty.
they
recognized
that
duty,
and
they
fulfilled
that
duty
prior
to
the
strike.
but
that
was
days
before
the
strike.
and
then
when
they
were
met
with...
when
they
were
rebuffed,
instead
of
seeking
perhaps
union
sanctions
or
seeking
some
kind
of
creative
way
to
avoid
what
they
foresaw,
they
just
treated
it
as
inevitable.
and
when
the
strike
occurred,
they
reacted
as
if
their
primary
concern
was
their
internal
union
political
situation
instead
of
the
no-strike
clause
which
they
had
signed,
which
was
far
and
away
the
most
important
aspect
of
their
responsibility.
as
far
as
the
analysis
that
was
suggested
by
justice
rehnquist,
which
was
to
the
effect
that
we
first
have
to
decide
whether
there
has
been
a
violation,
we
decided
there
has
been
a
violation
of
section
8(a)(3)
if
we
have
similarly
situated
individuals
treated
differently.
that's
what
happened
in
erie
resistor,
that's
what
happened
in
great
dane
trailer:
similarly
situated
individuals
treated
differently.
and
that's
why,
having
treated
them
differently
in
those
cases,
that
was
discrimination.
here
we
don't
have
similarly
situated
individuals.
we
have
rank-and-file
employees
juxtaposed
against
union
officers.
we
say
they
are
not
similarly
situated,
for
two
reasons:
number
one,
because
as
union
officers
they
inherently
have
a
greater
responsibility.
as
union
officers
they...
and
stewards...
they
have
a
responsibility
to
lead.
this
court
recognized
those
leadership
qualities
in
the
weingarten
case,
an
entirely
different...
in
an
entirely
different
context,
but
where
you
encouraged
that
if
the
rank-and-file
employee
wants
a
union
officer
or
a
steward
present,
he
should
have
that
steward
present.
why
should
we
presume
that
the
union
officer
or
the
steward
at
the
picket
line
is
going
to
be
so
ineffectual?
there
is
no
reason
for
us
to
presume
that
from
a
factual
standpoint
at
all.
so
we
say--
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
just...
in
this
situation,
justice
marshall,
we
had
the
picket
line
already
established.
that
picket
line
was
another
union's
picket
line.
okay.
the
union
officers'
only
effort
was
to
remove
that
picket
line.
we
say
that
we
didn't
hire
them
as
mediators,
thank
you.
if
anything,
by
attempting
to
remove
the
picket
line,
they
were
rubberstamping
that
they
had
no
duty
to
cross
it.
now,
if
what
you
mean
is
in
a
context
where
the
principal
union--
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
--well,
okay.
if
what
we
mean
is
given
a
situation
where
the
union
that
is
involved
sets
up
a
picket
line,
do
the
union
officers
have
a
duty
to
break
up
the
picket
line?
not
a
stranger
union,
but
another
union.
we
believe
that,
number
one,
they
have
a
duty
not
to
participate
in
that
picket
line;
and
number
two,
to
make
clear
to
the
other
employees
that
they
shouldn't
participate
in
that
picket
line.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
yes.
it's
our
position
that
they
must
cross
the
line.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
that's
correct.
that's--
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
--absolutely.
that
is
our
position.
they
should
lead
the
union
under
those
situations.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
no,
they
don't
have
to
use
force.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
nobody
is
suggesting...
nobody
is
suggesting
that
they
use
force
to
break
it
up.
but
they
ought
clearly
by
their
actions
signal
their
disagreement
with
that
line.
if
i
may
move
on
to--
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
--the
second
point--
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
--yes,
certainly.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
oh,
certainly,
we
would
say
that.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
absolutely.
that's...
if
it's
in
violation
as
stipulated
here,
justice
stevens.
if
it's
a
violation--
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
--that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
in
this
context--
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
--right.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
because
in
this
context
there
had
been
an
arbitration
decision,
not
either
of
the
two
that
are
the
principal
ones
in
this
case,
but
the
aldefer
decision
where
it
had
been
held
that
the
refusal
to
cross
a
picket
line
was
unlawful.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
we
have
a
stranger
picket
line.
we
have
another
union
that
established
a
picket
line.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
it
was
a
legal,
insofar
as
we
are
concerned,
we
can
treat
it
as
if
it
were
legal.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
that's
correct.
that's
clearly
the
case.
now,
that's
the
reason
why
we...
that's
one
reason
why
we
say
similarly
situated,
because
it
was
inherent
in
their
position.
the
other
reason
why
we
say
that
the
union
officers
were
not
similarly
situated
is,
very
simply,
because
by
contract
the
board
and
five
circuits
now
hold
that
you
can
impose
greater
duties
on
union
officers,
or
we
say
it
was
imposed
by
the
arbitration
awards.
that
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
they
were
in
place
4-1/2
years.
the
spielberg
analysis--
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
--justice
white,
you
make
my
point
better
than
i
could
make
it,
because
yes,
he
can.
but
it
was
the
parties
who
bargained
for
that
second
arbitrator
to
perhaps
disagree
with
the
first
arbitrator.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
well,
justice
white,
it
is
my
position,
it
is
our
position,
that
the
party...
if
a
second
arbitrator
reverses
the
first
arbitrator,
it
was
his
judgment
that
was
bargained
for
by
the
parties.
if,
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
--this
case
supposes--
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
--if
two
arbitrators
disagree
as
to
what
the
contract,
and
if
it
is
a
matter
that
is
presently
under
consideration,
unlike
this
situation,
we
don't
have
here
this
typical
spielberg
situation
which
the
board
would
rely
upon.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
arbitration
awards
were
already
in
place,
they
were
part
of
the
contract.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
the
posture
in
which
the
board
becomes
involved
is
after
the
arbitration
award.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
that's--
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
sileo
i
am
sorry.
