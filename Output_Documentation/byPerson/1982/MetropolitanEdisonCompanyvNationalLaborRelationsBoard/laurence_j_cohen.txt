mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i
think
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
case
here.
the
union's
position
proceeds
on
a
two-step
analysis.
the
board's
does
not.
our--
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
--our
initial
position
is
that
the
right
to
protect
employee
union
officials
from
employment
discipline
for
the
manner
in
which
they
exercise
their
office
may
not
be
waived.
the
board
says
the
court
need
not
reach
that
issue
here.
if
you
put
that
aside,
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us...
and
i
will
probably
address
that
after
lunch...
if
that
right
may
be
waived,
then
the
question
is
exactly
that:
what
does
the
contract
provide?
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
it
might
indeed
have
that
effect,
but
they
would
have
consciously
given
up
that
right
to
be
free
from
discipline,
to
have
placed
that
additional
burden
on
themselves
in
the
bargaining
process.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
not
at
all.
we
think
they...
you
begin
here
with
a
statutory
right
to
be
free
from
discrimination.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
in
this
context,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
such
responsibility
inherent
in
union
office
itself.
i
agree
with
you
that
if
the
right
may
be
waived,
the
contract
may
spell
out
those
rights
and
responsibilities.
and
by
way
of
contrast
and
by
way
of
example,
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
south
central
bell
decision
looked
to
an
earlier
third
circuit
decision
in
gould
where
the
parties
very
specifically
provided
if
there
is
a
work
stoppage,
the
union
official
shall
do
this,
this,
this,
and
this.
they
said
that
is
an
assumption
of
responsibilities.
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
they
said,
lies
metropolitan
edison
where
you
have
nothing
more
than
a
general
or
neutral
no-strike
clause;
therefore,
the
contract
imposes
no
such
responsibilities.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
that
is
the
union...
is
not
the
statutory
right
of
the
union
official--
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
--may
not
be
waived--
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
--no.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
no,
i
am
not.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
i
am
going
to
argue
that
the
statutory
right
of
the
union
officials
who
are
employees
to
be
free
from
employment
discrimination
may
not
be
waived
by
contract.
in
fact,
maybe
i
should
do
that
right
now
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
brennan.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
well,
i
view
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
say,
the
first
of
two
steps.
most...
most...
all
of
the
courts
below
have
said
that
the
right
may
be
waived.
we
think
they
have
come
to
that
conclusion
by
not
analyzing
what
this
court...
the
distinction
this
court
drew
in
mastro
plastics
on
the
one
hand
and
on
magnovox
and
gardner-denver
on
the
other.
and
the
difference
is
between
collective
rights,
the
right
to
strike
in
mastro
which
may
be
waived,
and
the...
as
basic
associational
rights
which
were
involved
in
magnovox,
which
this
court
held
could
not
be
waived.
and
as
the
board
said
in
a
leading
case
which
was
cited
by
the
third
circuit
below
and
by
most
of
the
other
circuits
that
have
dealt
with
this
issue,
general
motors
corp.,
the
holding
of
union
office
is
the
essence
of
protected
union
activities.
the
court
then
drew
the
same
distinction
again
in
gardner-denver,
which
arose
in
the
title
vii
case,
where
justice
powell
speaking
for
a
unanimous
court,
distinguished
between
collective
rights
of
employees
to
strike
and
an
individual
employee's
right
to
be
free
from
employment
discrimination.
under
title
vii,
of
course,
it's
race
or
sex
discrimination.
but
here
there
is
another
specifically
prohibited
form
of
employment
discrimination,
that
based
on
union
activity,
to
wit,
the
holding
of
union
office
and
the
exercise
of
union
responsibilities.
now
let
me
address
a
question
that
justice
white
asked,
was
there
a
signal
here?
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
of
the
context
in
which
this
case
arose.
the
signal
was
precisely
the
opposite,
the
administrative
law
judge
found,
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed,
in
effect,
that
the
leaders
virtually...
lang
and
light...
begged
the
employees
before
this
incident
on
several
occasions,
you
have
a
responsibility
to
cross
the
picket
line
of
another
union
and
go
to
work.
the
employees
at
two
union
meetings
shouted
them
down,
said
that
anyone
who
went
through
a
picket
line,
especially
an
officer,
was
a
scab,
that
the
officers
lost
control
of
the
meeting.
and
if
there
was
a
signal,
justice
white,
all
along
it
was:
go
to
work,
you
have
a
duty
to
do
so.
and
there
is
support
in
the
record.
mr.
laurence
j.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
in
my
remaining
time
i
would
like
to
make
several
points
which
arose
this
morning.
first
the
company
contends
that
affirmance
of
the
decision
below
would
undermine
the
steelworkers
trilogy.
i
submit
that
the
board's
right
to
review
contract
language
in
order
to
determine
statutory
rights
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
first
are
different
from
the
contractual
issues
which
arbitrators
resolve
under
the
trilogy,
and
second,
the
board's
authority
to
make
those
determinations
has
been
expressly
upheld
in
what
i
will
call
a
quartet
of
later
cases;
specifically,
c&c
plywood,
acme,
strong,
and
gardner-denver.
after
a
thoroughgoing
discussion
of
that
issue
in
acme,
the
court
had
this
sentence
which
i
think
sums
up
my
point
perfectly:
"to
view
the
steelworkers
decisions
as
automatically
requiring
the
board
in
this
case
to
defer
to
the
primary
determination
of
an
arbitrator
is
to
overlook
important
distinction
between
those
cases
and
this
one.
"
that
is
at
385
u.s.
437.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
to
recall
that
a
person
who
serves
as
an
employee
and
a
union
official
has
two
sets
of
duties.
as
an
employee,
certainly
he
has
obligations
to
the
employer.
as
a
union
official,
he
has
duties
running
only
to
the
union
and
the
union
members...
unless,
of
course,
he
waives
the
right
as
an
employee
to
be
free
of
employer
discipline
for
the
manner
in
which
he
exercises
his
official
functions
in
the
union.
and
that
gets
us
to
the
question
of
what
does
constitute
an
adequate
waiver.
that
question
had
its
genesis
in
mastro
plastics,
where
this
court
required
an
explicit
waiver
of
statutory
rights.
since
then
the
circuit
courts
and
the
board
have
phrased
it
in
terms
of
a
clear
and
unmistakable
waiver.
we
submit
that
no
such
waiver
can
be
found
in
this
case.
there
is
no
language
in
the
agreement
that
imposes
specific
duties
on
union
officials.
the
general
or
neutral
no-strike
clause
is
not
sufficient.
it
wouldn't
suffice
under
mastro,
and
both
the
d.c.
circuit
and
fifth
circuit
have
held
it
inadequate
in
these
circumstances.
the
howard
and
seidenberg
arbitration
awards
are
not
sufficient
because
they
did
not
even
purport
to
decide
any
statutory
issues.
and
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
they
really
didn't
deal
with
any
specific
provisions
in
the
contract
itself.
in
fact,
if
everything
else
the
company
said
were
correct,
its
argument
would
still
fail,
we
believe,
because
of
the
language
of
section
9.2
paragraph
4
in
the
agreement,
which
is
the
arbitration
provision,
which
states
that
arbitration
decisions
shall
be
"binding
for
the
term
of
this
agreement.
"
we
think
that
was
clearly
a
term
of
limitation
on
the
precedential
effect
of
awards
that
are
issued.
the
company
throughout
its
two
briefs
cites
the
elkouri
text,
which
is
the
leading
arbitration
text.
there
is
an
additional
sentence
which
is
not
found
in
the
company
briefs:
"the
parties
are
free
in
any
case
to
stipulate
as
to
what
precedential
role
a
forthcoming
award
shall
play.
"
that
is
at
379
of
the
elkouri
book.
that
is
precisely
what
they
have
done
here.
now,
justice
o'connor,
contrary
to
my
distinguished
colleague,
i
would
argue
that
the
phrase
in
the
agreement
is
not
surplusage.
he
says
it
occurs
throughout
the
agreement.
in
fact,
their
brief
cites
only
five
instances
in
an
agreement
of
almost
60
pages
where
it
is
found.
with
the
exception
of
the
no-strike
clause,
none
of
the
provisions
in
the
agreement
which
mr.
sileo
cited
earlier
were
in
fact
mentioned
by
arbitrators
howard
or
seidenberg.
and
finally
the...
well,
i
made
that
point
already.
the
other
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
unions
and
employers
alike
agree
about
the
destructiveness
of
wildcat
strikes.
where
we
differ
is
on
the
question
of
whether
disparate
discipline
of
union
officials
helps
that
problem
or
exacerbates
it.
we
think
it
exacerbates
it.
although
i
differ
in
some
respects
from
some
of
justice
powell's
concurring
opinion
in
complete
auto
transit,
i
think
he
summed
up
the
problem
in
this
one
sentence
in
a
wildcat
situation:
"worker
recalcitrance
sometimes
is
directed
at
the
incumbent
union
leadership
as
much
as
at
company
management.
"

thank
you
very
much.
