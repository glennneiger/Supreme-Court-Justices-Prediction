mr.
come,
would
you
agree
that,
as
i
follow
the
argument,
your
opponent
says
we
should
decide
the
case
narrowly
just
by
looking
at
the
arbitration
awards,
but
if
i
understand
your
presentation,
we
really
have
to
decide
both
issues
because
you
say
that
we
can't
evaluate
the
arbitration
issue
without
first
deciding
whether
there
would
be
a
discriminatory
act
by
a
disparate
discipline.
so
we
really
have
to
decide
both
issues,
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
get
a
higher
standard
of
waiver
is
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
before
you
move
on--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
would
say
they
have
to
cross
the
line
even
if
it's
a
legal
line
by
another
union.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
the
failure
to
cross
is
the
violation,
not
necessarily
the
picket
line.
this
is
a
failure...
it's
the
refusal
to
cross
the
picket
line--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
the
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
picket
line
itself
is
a
perfectly
lawful
labor
activity.
