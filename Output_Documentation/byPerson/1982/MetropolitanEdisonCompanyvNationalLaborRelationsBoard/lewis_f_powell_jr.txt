justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
a
case
that
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
it
arises
out
of
an
unlawful
work
stoppage
that
occurred
when
employees
of
metropolitan
edison
company,
members
of
the
electrical
workers
union
refused
to
cross
a
picket
line
established
by
a
different
union.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
contained
a
no-strike
clause.
officials
of
the
company,
relying
on
this
clause
demanded
that
the
officers
of
the
electrical
workers
union
cross
the
picket
line.
they
declined
to
do
so.
as
a
result
of
this
refusal,
the
company
imposed
discipline
on
the
electrical
workers
officers
more
severe
than
that
imposed
on
whether
union
members
who
had
participated
in
the
unlawful
work
stoppage.
meanwhile,
the
union
officials
had
negotiated
a
settlement
between
the
pickets
and
the
company
and
this
ended
the
unlawful
strike.
the
union
then
filed
a
complaint
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
charging
that
the
company
had
discriminated
against
its
officials
in
violation
of
section
8(a)(3)
of
the
act.
the
board
agreed
and
the
court
of
appeals
enforced
the
board's
order.
we
also
agree
that
in
the
absence
of
an
explicit
contractual
duty,
an
employer
may
not
assume
that
a
union
official
has
a
duty
to
enforce
a
no-strike
clause
by
complying
with
the
employer's
directions.
we
think
the
board's
view
that
the
enhanced
penalty
imposed
on
the
union
officials
would
violate
section
8(a)(3)
is
correct.
it
is
consistent
with
the
principle
that
neither
the
representatives
of
management
or
of
labor
should
be
coerced
in
the
performance
of
their
official
duties.
although
the
union
may
waive
this
statutory
protection,
the
bargaining
agreement
in
this
case
does
not
establish
clearly
and
unmistakably
that
the
union
intended
to
do
so.
we
therefore
affirm
unanimously
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
