mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
union
officers
light
and
lang
engaged
in
the
same
unauthorized
refusal
to
work
as
did
the
company's
other
employees,
yet
they
received
suspensions
of
29
days,
were
warned
that
they
would
be
discharged
the
next
time,
while
the
other
employees
received
only
5
to
10-day
suspensions.
the
notices
issued
to
lang
and
light
made
clear
that
they
had
received
the
enhanced
discipline
because
they
were
union
officers.
it
is
the
board's
position
that
such
a
disciplinary
standard
constitutes
disparate
treatment
that
forseeably
discourages
employees
from
engaging
in
the
protected
activity
of
assisting
the
union
by
serving
as
union
officers.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
only
comes
up
insofar
as
you
have
a
question
of
whether
there
was
any
discrimination
that
the
board
can
remedy.
now,
i
want
to
make--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--it
perfectly
clear
that
the
board's
position
is
not
to
say
that
union
officers
enjoy
any
right
to
engage
in
unprotected
strikes.
the
board's
position
permits
the
employer
to
discipline
a
union
officer
for
engaging
in
an
unauthorized
work
stoppage
to
the
same
extent
that
any
other
employee
could
be
disciplined.
secondly,
if
there
is
evidence
that
the
union
officer
actively
led
the
strike
or
instigated
it,
the
board's
position
would
permit
more
severe
discipline.
there
is
no
such
finding
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
board's
finding
that
light
and
lang
did
not
actively
lead
this
strike
nor
call
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
made
every
effort
to
stop
the
strike,
and
they
were
ultimately
successful
in
getting
the
picket
line
removed
so
that
the
men
could
return
to
work.
so
we
do
not
have
a
case--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--they
did...
they
did
not
immediately
return
to
work,
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
for
that,
they
could
have
been
disciplined
just
like
the
rank-and-file
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
submit,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--surely.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
of
course,
your
first
situation,
if
you
could
prove
bad
motive,
you
would
have
the
classic
violation
of
8(a)(3).
mr.
norton
j.
come
you
can't
prove
bad
motive,
it
is
the
board's
position,
absent
the
effect
of
a
contract
which
might
impose
higher
responsibilities
on
union
officers,
and
that
is
the
second
issue
in
this
case.
the
mere
act
of
disciplining
a
union
leader
or
officer
who
did
not
actively
instigate
or
lead
the
strike
is
discrimination
which
has
the
forseeable
effect
of
discouraging
the
protected
activity
of
serving
in
union
office.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
inherently
destructive
of
that
right.
i
might
say
that
the
four
courts
of
appeals
that
have
considered
this
naked
proposition
have
agreed
with
the
court...
or
the
board.
the
most
recent
decision
is
by
judge
gee,
writing
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
south
central
bell.
and
the
reason
for
it
is
this,
your
honor.
unauthorized
work
stoppages,
whether
they
are
an
expression
of
resentments
in
the
plant
or
as
here,
the
result
of
the
employee's
aversion
to
crossing
another
union's
picket
line,
often
do
not
begin
under
the
leadership
of
a
union
officer.
this
is
shown
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
following
the
august
4
work
stoppage,
president
lang
told
the
members
at
a
meeting
that
the
international
had
said
that
under
the
contract
they
were
obligated
to
cross
the
picket
line.
mr.
norton
j.
come
lang
was
an
employee.
he
was
also
an
elected
official.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
did
not
cross
the
picket
line.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
in
the
circumstances
where
he
made
it
plain
that--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--he
didn't--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
he--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--it
is
not,
in
the
view
of
the
board
and
of
the
courts
of
appeals,
sufficient
to--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--yes,
your
honor,
it
has.
and
the
four
courts
of
appeals
have
agreed
with
it.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is.
it
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
in
a
wildcat
strike
the
union
officer
may
well
believe
that
he
will
be
most
effective
with
the
men
or
women
in
getting
the
unauthorized
strikes
ended
if
he
does
not
cross
that
picket
line
but
instead
devotes
his
energies,
as
lang
and
light
did
here,
to
removing
the
picket
line.
as
the
seventh
circuit
pointed
out
in
heist,
for
the
union
officer
to
take
the
additional
step
of
crossing
that
line
is
often
suicidal
because
he
completely
depreciates
any
credibility
that
he
had
with
the
men
by
being
a
scab.
and
this
is
what
lang
and
light
were
told
at
the
union
meeting
on
august
4th
where
they
urged
the
men
in
the
future
not
to
respect
the
picket
line.
it
is
for
that
reason
that
the
mere
naked
act
of
a
union
officer
in
doing
nothing
more
than
not
crossing
the
picket
line
has
been
held
by
the
board
and
the
courts
that
have
reviewed
it
as
not
constituting
sufficient
action
to
justify
disparate
punishment.
the
only
such
disparate
punishment
is
not
likely
to
end
the
wildcat
strike
and
can
only
have
the
forseeable
effect
of
discouraging
employees
from
wanting
to
serve
as
union
officers.
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
brings
us
to
the
second
issue
in
this
case
and...
which
i
now
will
turn
to.
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
acme
case
and
in
carey
against
westinghouse
and
under
similar
circumstances
in
alexander
versus
gardner-denver
which
involved
title
vii,
that
the
relationship
of
an
arbitrator
to
the
courts,
which
is
what
the
trilogy
deals
with,
is
quite
different
from
the
relationship
of
the
board
to
the
arbitral
process.
the
board...
the
arbitrator's
task
is
to
interpret
the
contract.
and
in
interpreting
the
contract,
he
can
rely
on
most
anything.
he
just
has
to
get
it
somehow
from
the
essence
of
the
contract.
he
doesn't
even
have
to
give
reasons.
and
a
court
will
usually
sustain
him
because
he
is
an
expert
on
the
law
of
the
shop.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
might.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
correct,
but--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--the
point,
though,
is
that
the
board's
job
is
to
interpret
the
statute,
and
section
10(a)
provides
that
the
board's
power
shall
not
be
affected
by
any
other
method
of...
or
agreement
or
adjustment.
now,
the
board,
of
course,
has
discretion
to
defer
to
an
arbitrator's
decision.
and
it
has
indicated
in
the
spielberg
case
and
subsequently
the
standards
under
which
it
will
defer
to
an
arbitrator's
interpretation
of
the
contract
in
a
situation
where
there
is
a
congruence
between
statutory
and
contractual
rights.
but
among
the
conditions
that
must
be
met
for
such
deferral
in
the
board's
judgment,
and
the
courts
have
tended
to
agree
with
these
standards,
is
that
the
arbitrator
must
have
decided
not
only
the
contract
issue
but
the
statutory
issue
and
to
have
done
so
in
a
way
that
is
not
repugnant
to
the
act.
now,
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
in
the
statute
that
the
board
has
enunciated
and
has
been
accepted
by
the
courts
over
many
years
is
that
if
a
statutory
right
can
be
waived
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
the
parties...
and
there
are
some
statutory
rights,
like
the
right
to
strike,
that
can
be
waived,
and
there
are
others
that
are
so
fundamental
to
the
employee,
like
the
right
to
unseat
the
incumbent
bargaining
agent
that
the
court
was
faced
with
in
magnovox,
that
cannot
be
waived,
and
as
this
court
indicated
in
alexander
v.
gardner-denver
the
right
to
be
free
of
racial
discrimination...
if
you
do
have
a
right
that
can
be
waived,
it
has
to
be
done
by
clear
and
unmistakable
language
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
generally.
now,
the
board
and
the
court,
judge
gee,
who
had
a
similar
problem
in
south
central
bell,
sustained
the
board's
view
the
the
kind
of
contract
language
that
you
had
here
and
the
kind
of
arbitrator's
decisions
of
the
contract
that
you
had
here
would
not
be
sufficient
to
constitute
a
clear
and
unmistakable
waiver--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
any
disparate
treatment,
but
certainly
disparate
discipline
for
doing
the
same
refusal
to
work
here
would
violate
8(a)(3)
because
it
is
based
upon...
the
sole
difference
is
based
upon
holding
union
office,
i
mean
the
reason
for
the
enhanced
punishment.
and
that
has
the
tendency
to
discourage
engaging
in
that
protected
activity.
so
you
have
to
have
a
discrimination
that
is
based
upon
union
or
protected
activity
that
would
have...
that
would
be
inherently
destructive
of
that
right.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
is
not
based
on
bad
motive.
but
the
court
indicated
in
erie
resistor
and
again
in
great
dane
that
you
can
have
violations
of
section
8(a)(3)
that
are
not
based
on
bad
motive
where
you
can
find
that
the
result
of
the
discrimination
is
to
be
inherently
destructive
of
a
section
7
right.
and
that
is
what
is
the
case
here
for
the
reasons
that
i
tried
to
indicate
earlier
would
be
true
of
disciplining
a
union
officer
more
severely
for
engaging
in
an
unprotected
strike
solely
because
he
is
a
union
officer,
without...
if
you
don't
have
a
contract
that
would
permit
such
enhanced
discipline.
now,
the
question
is
whether
this...
the
board
was
reasonable
in
concluding
that
this
contract,
even
with
the
gloss
put
on
it
by
the
arbitrators,
was
not
sufficient
to
show
that
the
parties...
and
the
parties
we're
talking
about,
the
union,
which
is
the
one
that
would
be
waiving
the
right
of
its
employees
to
be
free
of
such
enhanced
discipline
and
for
becoming
a
union
officer,
consciously
agreed
to
permit
such
enhanced
discipline.
now
the--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
tried
to
address
that
at
the
outset
and
to
point
out
that
four
courts
of
appeals,
including
most
recently
the
fifth
circuit,
have
agreed
with
the
board
that
absent
a
contract
waiver
or
a
contract
clause
permitting
such
enhanced
discipline,
there
would
be
a
violation
of
section
8(a)(3).
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
our
argument.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
is
not...
well,
i
tried
to
explain
to
your
honor
the
reason
why
the
board's
position
is
a
reasonable
one.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because
it's
because
if
it
is
a
statutory
right
and
a
statutory
violation--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
the
arbitrator's
decision--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
i
think--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
this
court
held
in
complete
auto
transit,
i
believe,
that
you
cannot
hit
the
union
for
damages
absent
a
showing
that
they
were--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
would
not
be.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
have
to
turn
it
over
to
my
colleague,
mr.
cohen.
but
i
just
want
to
say
that
the
arbitrator's
decisions,
as
the
court
will
see
on
reading
them,
are...
point
to
no-contract
language.
there
is
none
here.
you
have
just
the
general
no-strike
clause.
and
the
board
believes
that
that
is
insufficient
to
measure
up
to
the
clear
and
unmistakable
waiver
that
would
be
required
for
waiving
a
statutory
right.
thank
you.
