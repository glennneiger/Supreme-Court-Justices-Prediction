mr.
sileo,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice

e.
burger
mr.
come.
chief
justice
warren
e.

what
is
the
board's
view
about
the
posture
of
the
union
leaders
in
terms
of
whether
rank-and-file
should
follow
their
directions;
for
example,
when
they
say
don't
go
on
a
strike?
is
there
any
board
law
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
whole
industrial
picture
that
the
board
wants
and
unions
want
members
to
follow
the
leader?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
point
that
was
being
addressed
at
the
close
of
your
colleague's
argument,
i
take
it
to
mean
that
if
the
contract
provided
that
greater
discipline
could
be
given
to
officers
than
rank-and-file
members
in
a
situation
like
this,
that
it
could
be
done.
is
that--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--but
let
me--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--if
the
contract...
assuming
that
a
contract
provides
it,
just
exactly
that,
how
does
it
help
the
basic
argument
that
the
board
has
been
making
that
this
discourages
people
from
becoming
union
leaders
if
there
is
some
way
in
which
union
leaders
can
be
disciplined
more
than
rank-and-file
members?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
think
the
acceptance
of
union
leadership
imposes
that
obligation,
an
obligation
to
lead
in
trying
to
avoid
illegal
strikes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
"not
at
all",
do
you
mean
there
is
no
obligation
on
a
union
leader
to
try
to
enforce
the
union's
contract
obligations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
that
adds
up
to
the
same
thing.
but
you
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00.
you
may
continue,
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
sileo?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is,
that
they
must,
in
your
view,
say
this
line
is...
does
not
really
exist
as
a
matter
of
law
because
it's
an
illegal
line,
it
is
not
a
picket
line
under
labor
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
therefore,
they
should
lead
the
union,
you
say,
by
crossing
that...
quote...
line.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
don't
have
to
go
out
and
use
force
to
break
it
up?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
not
saying
at
all--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
a
line
do
we
have
here,
now
just
to
get
that
straight?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the

in

national

announced
by
