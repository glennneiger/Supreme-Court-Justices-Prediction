doesn't
that
strike
you
as
rather
strange?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
might
be
different
if
you
had
been
the...
yourself
seeking
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
supporting
the
judgment
of
the
board.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
a
lot
of
government
agencies
can
come
here
without
showing
out
of
pocket
loss.
the
labor
board,
the
federal...
you
know,
just
all--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
going
to
get
into
some
of
those
anomalies
wherever
you
draw
the
line,
aren't
you?
aren't
you
going
to
find
them
on
the
pier,
in
adjacent
areas,
even
though
we
decide
this
case
in
your
favor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
the
experience
of
this
court
show
that
the
anomalies
would
be
alleviated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
as
a
matter...
i
take
it
your
argument
is
resting
on
article
iii,
not
on
a
particular
statutory
provision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
hasn't
our
general
practice
been
when
a
federal
agency
loses
a
case
in
which
its
actions
are
being
reviewed
in
a
court
of
appeals
that
there's
no
question
from
an
article
iii
standpoint
that
the
agency
can
seek
review
of
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
tanzen
was
just
a
summary
disposition.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
without
any
written
treatment
from
this
court
of
the
jurisdictional
issue.
