mr.
wilkins--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--your
argument
about
standing
doesn't
really
address
itself,
though,
to
the
article
3
standing
question
for
constitutional
purposes,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
as
i
understand
your
administrative
argument,
it
is
to
the
effect
that
you
have
to
give
advice
to
employees,
and
you
would
be
better
able
to
do
that
if
you
could
get
an
answer
to
these
questions,
and
is
that
really
not
in
the
nature
of
asking
an
advisory
opinion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wilkins,
i
do
have
one.
is
it
settled
that
if
the
employee
is
not
covered
by
the
act,
he
retains
his
seriacki
seaworthiness
action?
there
seemed
to
be
a
split
maybe
on
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
krutzel,
how
do
you
explain
the
language
in
the
senate
report
to
the
effect
that
the
1972
amendments
were
not
intended
to
exclude
other
employees
traditionally
covered?
and
isn't
it
clear
that
congress
was
concerned
about
the
davis
and
calbeck
decisions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
congress
explicitly
deleted
the
requirement
that
coverage
was
contingent
on
a
state
not
being
able
to
provide
a
valid
remedy,
isn't
that
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
isn't
that
the
very
language
that
calbeck
found
was
responsible
for
the
emphasis
on
the
troublesome
maritime
but
local
inquiry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
before
1972,
coverage
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
extended
only
to
injury
sustained
by
workers
on
the
actual
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
in
1972,
the
act
was
amended
by
expanding
the
navigable
water
situs
to
include
certain
adjoining
land
areas
and
by
adding
a
status
requirement
that
employees
covered
by
the
act
be
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
in
this
case,
an
employee
of
the
respondent
construction
firm
was
injured
while
performing
his
job
on
the
deck
of
a
cargo
barge
being
used
in
the
construction
of
a
sewage
treatment
plant
extending
over
the
hudson
river
in
new
york
city.
the
employees
claimed
for
compensation
under
the
act
was
denied
by
the
benefits
review
board
and
by
the
second
circuit
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
engaged
in
maritime
employment
because
his
employments
lacks
a
significant
relationship
to
navigation
or
to
commerce
on
navigable
waters.
the
director
of
the
office
of
workers'
compensation
programs,
who
is
a
respondent
in
the
court
of
appeals,
brought
the
petition
for
review
of
the
denial
of
benefits.
we
hold
that
it's
not
necessary
for
us
to
determine
whether
the
director
has
standing
in
his
own
right
to
seek
review
of
the
decision
below.
the
petition
of
the
director
brings
the
injured
employee
before
this
court
as
well
and
the
employee
has
sufficient
interest
in
the
question
at
issue
to
give
him
standing
urge
consideration
of
the
merits
of
the
decision
below.
on
the
merits
of
the
issue
presented,
we
hold
that
the
injured
employee
was
engaged
in
maritime
employment
and
is
thus
covered
by
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act.
the
employee
would
have
been
covered
under
the
longshoremen's
act
before
it
was
amended
in
1972
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1972
amendments
to
indicated
that
congress
intended
to
withdraw
coverage
from
employees
such
as
the
one
in
this
case
who
are
injured
on
the
navigable
waters
in
the
course
of
their
employment.
in
passing
the
1972
amendments,
congress
specifically
indicated
that
it
did
not
intend
to
exclude
employees
traditionally
covered
before
1972.
the
judgment
is
reversed
and
remanded
and
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
