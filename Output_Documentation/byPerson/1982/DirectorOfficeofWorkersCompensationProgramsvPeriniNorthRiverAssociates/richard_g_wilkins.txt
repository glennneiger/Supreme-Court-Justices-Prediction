mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
worker
injured
upon
actual
navigable
waters
who
would
have
been
covered
by
the
longshoremen's
act
prior
to
its
amendment
in
1972
retains
that
coverage,
or
whether
congress
by
amending
the
act
in
1972
restricted
coverage
for
this
class
of
amphibious
worker.
respondent
raymond
churchill
was
injured
in
1974
while
standing
aboard
a
crane
barge
engaged
in
unloading
a
caisson
from
a
supply
vessel
during
the
construction
of
the
north
river
pollution
control
project,
which
is
a
sewage
treatment
plant
that
extends
over
the
hudson
river
in
new
york
city.
he
filed
a
claim
for
compensation
under
the
act,
and
after
a
hearing,
the
administrative
law
judge
denied
that
claim,
concluding
that
he
was
not
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
the
benefits
review
board
by
a
divided
vote
subsequently
sustained
the
conclusion
of
the
administrative
law
judge,
and
the
second
circuit
denied
churchill's
petition
for
review,
concluding
that
his
employment
was
not
maritime
as
it
lacked
a
significant
relationship
to
navigation
or
to
commerce
on
navigable
waters.
there
can
be
little
dispute
but
that
prior
to
1972,
respondent
churchill
could
have
claimed
coverage
under
the
act.
prior
to
that
date,
the
act
covered
all
work-related
injuries
occurring
on
actual
navigable
waters.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
i
am
uncertain
as
to
the
actual
circumstances
for
that
failure.
he
did
file
a
brief
supporting
the
director's
petition,
however.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
justice
blackmun.
coverage
prior
to
1972
did
stop
at
the
water's
edge,
so
congress
in
1972
amended
the
act
in
part
to
eliminate
the
incongruities
of
this
coverage
rule
by
extending
the
coverage
of
the
act
ashore
for
the
first
time
to
certain
areas
contiguous
to
the
water's
edge.
the
act
as
amended
also
contained
a
second
coverage
requirement.
not
only
must
the
injury
occur
on
a
covered
situs,
but
the
employee
must
meet
a
status
test.
section
2(3)
of
the
act
defines
a
covered
employee
as
any
person
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
the
proper
application
of
this
maritime
employment
status
test
to
a
traditionally
covered
amphibious
worker
is
the
question
currently
before
the
court.
proper
consideration
and
analysis
of
this
question
requires
careful
attention
to
three
important
factors.
first,
the
term
"maritime
employment"
itself
has
traditionally
been
construed
as
including
all
work
actually
taking
place
on
navigable
waters.
second,
it
is
very
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
1972
amendments
that
congress
intended
to
retain
this
traditional
coverage
for
longshore...
for
maritime
workers
and
amphibious
workers
injured
on
actual
navigable
waters.
mr.
wilkins,
could
i
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the
point
raised
by
justice
blackmun?
is
it
the
government's
position
that
although
the
propriety
of
the
director's
appealing
to
the
court
of
appeals
may
be
very
much
open
to
doubt
in
a
case
like
this,
it
is
the
propriety
of
the
director's
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
a
court
of
appeals
judgment
is
perfectly
clear?
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no.
there
is
no
court
of
appeals
that
questions
the
propriety
of
the
director's
participation
in
a
petition
for
review
as
a
respondent.
the
second
circuit
does
not
question
that,
and
indeed
we
participated
as
a
party
respondent
in
this
case.
once
we
are
a
proper
party
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
certiorari
statute,
2812.54,
states
that
any
party
may
apply
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
so,
we
are
clearly
as
a
party
respondent
entitled.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
there
is
currently
something
of
a
conflict
among
the
circuits.
at
least
three
circuits
grant
the
director
standing
to
seek
a
petition
for
review.
two
circuits
that
i
am
aware
of
have
raised
a
question
regarding
this.
this
question,
though,
is
not
presented
in
this
case,
as
we
were
and
we
concededly
were
a
proper
party
below.
the
third
important--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--there
is
an
important
coverage
question
at
issue
here.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
we--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--we
didn't
lose
any
monetary
amount,
if
that
is
the
question.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
we
lost
the
ability
to
effectively
administer
and
interpret...
to
fulfill
our
administrative
responsibilities
under
the
act.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
to
the
extent
that
we...
we
argue
that
we
have
administrative
interests
in
interpreting
the
act.
that
is
historically
in
many
cases
from...
that
are
cited
in
our
reply
brief
have
found
that
an
administrative
interest
that
has
been
impaired
by
a
decision
below
is
sufficient
to
give
a
governmental
entity
injury.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
not
really,
justice
o'connor.
we
also
have
other
administrative
responsibilities.
for
example,
under
section
932
of
the
act,
we
have
to
enforce
the
insurance
requirements
of
the
act.
we
have
to
bring
actions
against
employers
who
do
not
comply
with
the
insurance
requirements.
under
the
second
circuit's
decision,
an
entire
range
of
employers,
marine
construction
employers,
for
example,
do
not
have
to
comply
with
that
act,
yet
under
the
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit,
for
example,
we
have
a
responsibility
to
enforce
932
against
these
employers.
so,
the
decision
below
does
really
impose
differing
enforcement
responsibilities
and
different...
of
a
very
severe
and
important
nature.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
as
far
ago
as
the
old
in
re
debs
opinion,
this
court
stated
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
government
cannot
show
monetary
loss
is
insufficient
to
estop
the
government
standing
in
federal
court.
the
third
important
consideration
beyond
the
fact
that
the
term
"maritime
employment"
historically
includes
work
on
the
water
and
congressional
intent,
is
the
fact
that
the
navigation
or
commerce
test
utilized
below
leads
to
illogical
results,
and
has
clearly
been
shown
to
be
impracticable
and
unworkable
as
a
means
of
delineating
coverage
under
the
act.
respondent
perini
north
river
associates
would
argue
that
the
term
"maritime
employment"
reaches
only
those
activities
that
possess
some
substantial
connection
to
commercial
shipping
or
navigation.
the
term,
however,
has
never
been
so
strictly
limited.
the
plain
meaning,
indeed,
of
the
term
"maritime
employment"
clearly
reaches
those
occupations
that
are
regularly
performed
on
actual
navigable
waters.
although
there
is
virtually
no
explicit--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--prior
to
1972,
no,
because
the
pier
would
have
been
considered
land
because
it
was
permanently
attached
to
land.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
the
sewage
treatment
plant
itself
might
have
been
like
a
pier.
mr.
churchill,
however,
was
standing
on
a
barge
floating
on
actual
navigable
waters,
a
barge
that
had
four
motors
to
navigate
itself
upon
the
water.
he
clearly
would
have
been
covered
before
the
act.
he
was
not
on
an
extension
of
land.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
although
there
has
virtually
been
no...
although
there
is
no
explicit
discussion
of
the
maritime
employment
requirement,
or
virtually
none,
prior
to
'72,
the
reported
cases
of
this
and
other
federal
courts
make
it
very
clear
that
employment
on
the
water
was
considered
maritime.
indeed,
all
of
the
cases
that
were
decided
under
the
old
maritime
local
doctrine
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
employment
on
the
water
is
by
itself
maritime,
although
in
particular
cases
it
can
be
local.
indeed,
professors
gilmore
and
black
state
that
workers
who
are
not
seamen
but
who
nevertheless
suffer
injury
on
navigable
waters,
are
no
doubt
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
notwithstanding
this
historic
construction--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
if
he
had
to
go
aboard
the
barge
to
end
the
delivery,
and
he
was
required
to
do
that
in
the
course
of
his
employment,
under
pre-1972
law
and
under
the
historic
construction
of
the
term,
while
he
was
on
the
barge,
yes,
he
would
have
been
covered.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
if
he
was
required
to
deliver
that
pizza
in
the
course
of
his
employment
and
go
upon
the
actual
navigable
waters
in
the
course
of
his
employment,
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes,
he
will,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
he
has
retained
his
own
attorney,
and
his
own
attorney
has
filed
various
briefs.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
mr.
churchill's
attorney
has
filed
a
brief
in
support
of
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
a
brief
as
a
respondent
in
this
court.
he
did
even
request
to
argue.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
the
court
has
indeed
granted,
for
example,
in
the
walter
tanson
case,
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
we
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
without
the
claimant,
and
the
court
granted
our
petition
and
reversed.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
strange
when
you
consider
that
we
have
very
important
enforcement
responsibilities
that
go
beyond
perhaps
the
individual
interests.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
we
certainly
can,
when
they
arise.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
your
honor,
this
case--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--there
is
no
question
but
that
this
is
a
live
controversy.
respondent
churchill
is
before
this
court
as
a
party
respondent.
the
case
is
live.
he
will
receive
his
benefits.
notwithstanding
the
historic
construction
of
the
term
1972
by
adding
a
maritime
employment
requirement.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1972
act
is
not
extensive.
however,
the
clear
import
of
that
legislative
history
is
that
congress
intended
to
extend
the
coverage
of
the
act
to
cover
additional
workers.
congress
was
concerned
about
the
incongruity
of
workers
crossing
over
the
jensen
line
from
navigable
waters
to
dry
land
and
thereby
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
under
our
view
of
the
act,
no.
indeed,
the
purpose
of
congress
in
amending
the
act
in
1972
was
to
extend
the
coverage
of
mr.
churchill
ashore.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
we
contend
that
because
of
the
substantial
nature
of
his
duties
upon
actual--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--in
that
circumstance,
no,
because
he
still
performs
substantial
duties
of
a
maritime
nature.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
that
is
a
question...
you
may
have
a
problem
with
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage
in
that
case.
the
director...
the
labor
department
has
taken
the
position
that
all
employees
are
covered
while
they
are
on
actual
navigable
waters,
whether
or
not
they--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--i
can't
give
you
an
exact
percentage.
it
would
require
looking
at
each
individual
case
to
determine
whether
the
work
on
the
water
was
merely
incidental
to
the
work
on
the
land,
or
whether
the
work
on
the
land
was
more
incidental
to
work
on
the
water.
if
work
on
the
water
was
extremely
tangential,
and
incidental
to
his
land-based
duties,
he
may
not
retain
coverage
when
he
crossed
to
dry
land.
it
is
important
to
remember
that
while
congress
intended
to
restrict
this
problem
of
walking
in
and
out
of--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--no.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
because
congress
intended
to
extend
coverage
for
clearly...
for
amphibious
workers
ashore.
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--amphibious
workers,
period.
the
act
prior
to
1972
covered
amphibious
workers.
the
purpose
of
extending
the
coverage
ashore
was
to
prevent
the
continual
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage.
congress
stated,
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
was
to
permit
a
uniform
compensation
system
to
apply
to
employees
who
would
otherwise
be
covered
for
part
of
their
activities.
churchill
prior
to
'72
was
covered
for
those
injuries,
for
those
activities
afloat.
congress
meant
to
cover
those
that
took
place
on
shore.
but
while
covering
those
activities
on
shore,
they
recognized
that
they
were
opening
up
the
possibility
that
many
land-based,
totally
land-based
workers
could
claim
for
the
first
time
coverage
under
the
act.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no.
this
is
just--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--exactly.
we
only
need
to
argue...
we
only
need
to
win
that
mr.
churchill,
because
he
was
on
actual
navigable
waters,
is
covered.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
we
alleviate
to
some
extent
the
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage
problem.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
it
does
not,
your
honor,
and
i
hope
to
address
those
opinions
very
shortly,
because
they
are
crucial
to
our
position
in
this
case.
congress
enacted
the
maritime
employment
requirement
solely
to
limit
the
availability
of
the
longshoremen's
act
to
totally
land-based
workers
who
previously
to
1972
had
to
rely
solely
upon
state
compensation
acts.
it
did
not
intend
to
restrict
coverage
of
amphibious
workers.
indeed,
the
senate
reports
state
this
conclusion
forcefully.
amended
section
2(3)
specifically
includes
any
longshoreman
or
other
person
engaged
in
longshoring
operations.
it
does
not
exclude
employees
traditionally
covered.
the
navigation
or
commerce
test
utilized
below
not
only
ignores
the
traditional
content
of
the
term
'72
amendments,
but
it
leads
to
illogical
results
and
has
been
shown
by
this
court
to
be
impracticable
and
unworkable
as
a
means
of
delineating
coverage.
the
illogical
and
doctrinaire
results
created
by
this
test
are
well
illustrated
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
respondent
churchill,
unlike
land-based
workers
who
perform
similar
tasks,
was
constantly
on,
over,
surrounded
by
navigable
waters.
he
was
faced
with
unique
marine
dangers.
his
work
required
the
use
of
protective
marine
gear.
it
required
knowledge
of
specialized
techniques
to
deal
with
the
exigencies
of
work
on
the
water.
he
was
constantly
required
to
load
and
unload
supply
vessels.
notwithstanding
this
unique
marine
nature
of
his
activities,
the
court
below
looked
to
sewage
treatment
plant
and
asked
whether
it,
not
respondent
churchill,
had
some
connection
to
maritime
activities.
the
illogic
of
this
result
is
made
patent
when
this
case
is
considered
with
another
case
arising
from
this
same
construction
project,
mattson
v.
perini
north
river
associates.
there,
the
second
circuit
and
the
benefits
review
board
both
upheld
coverage
for
another
worker
involved
in
constructing
this
same
sewage
treatment
plant
who,
like
mr.
churchill,
was
involved
in
driving
caissons
for
the
plant,
doing
very
similar
work.
why?
solely
because
mr.
mattson
was
driving
caissons
at
a
portion
of
the
plant
that
would
subsequently
be
used
to
load
processed
sludge
aboard
vessels.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
there
may
be
some
anomalies,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
those
anomalies
will
be
greatly
alleviated
as
the
experience
of
this
court
has
shown.
the
test
utilized
below
is
an
impracticable
means
of
delineating
the
coverage
of
employment
on
the
water.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
well,
i
can
answer
that,
but
to
do
that
i
need
to
go
into
a
little
bit
of
history,
and
i
would
like
to
do
that
right
now.
the
test,
the
navigation
or
commerce
test
was
first
adopted
post-enactment
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
weyerhauser
company
v.
gilmore.
the
court
in
that
case
stated
that
it
was
no
help
to
consider
the
prior
decisions
of
this
and
other
federal
courts
that
had
considered
the
question
of
the
proper
state
and
federal
jurisdiction
under
the
act.
the
court
said
that
the
1972
amendments
had
instead
instituted
a
clear
line
between
state
and
federal
jurisdiction,
but
in
explicating
this
clear
line,
it
explicitly
relegated
to
limbo,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
the
davis
and
calbeck
decisions
of
this
court.
but
in
its
hasty
relegation
to
limbo
of
all
prior
experience
under
the
act,
it
failed
to
recognize
that
the
navigation
or
commerce
test
has
been
shown
to
be
completely
unworkable
and
impracticable
as
a
means
of
delineating
coverage.
for
nearly
35
years
following
the
original
enactment
of
the
longshoremen's
act,
this
and
other
federal
courts
struggled
under
the
maritime
but
local
doctrine
to
determine
which
employments
on
the
water
were
maritime
or
possessed
a
significant
relationship
to
navigation
and
commerce,
and
therefore
fell
within
federal
coverage,
and
those
that
lacked
that
elusive
connection
and
therefore
were
maritime
but
local.
in
1942,
in
the
davis
decision,
this
court
noted
that
the
lines
that
had
been
drawn
over
the
water
were
so
fine,
the
decisions
so
confusing,
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
court
stated
that
we
could
quote
cases
on
either
side,
for
recovery
or
against
recovery,
on
the
facts
of
the
davis
case.
in
light
of
this
terrible
morass
of
cases
that
developed,
the
court
was
forced
to
create
the
twilight
zone
within
which
state
and
federal
remedies
overlapped.
twenty
years
later,
in
the
calbeck
decision,
this
court
further
overlapped
state
and
federal
remedies
by
declaring
that
federal
jurisdiction
extended
to
all
injuries
that
occurred
on
actual
navigable
waters.
the
court
concluded
that
this
was
necessary
to
spare
employees
"the
uncertainty,
expense,
delay
of
fighting
out
in
litigation
whether
their
particular
cases
fell
within
or
without
state
acts
under
the
local
concern
doctrine.
"
in
short,
all
of
the
cases
prior
to
calbeck
under
the
maritime
but
local
doctrine
demonstrate,
and
this
court
finally
recognized,
that
it
was
completely
unworkable
and
impracticable
to
draw
a
navigation
or
commerce
line
between
state
and
federal
jurisdiction.
this
court,
moreover,
has
been
unwilling
to
relegate
this
experience
to
limbo.
two
years
ago,
in
the
sun
ship
decision,
the
court
declined
to
draw
a
similar
line
between
state
and
federal
jurisdiction
over
land-based
injuries.
this
case
is
very
similar
to
the
sun
ship
decision,
and
should
be
decided
as
the
court
decided
the
sun
ship
decision,
by
harkening
to
the
clarifying
opinions
in
davis
and
calbeck,
and
refusing
to
recreate
the
jurisdictional
monstrosity
that
those
cases
eradicated.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
certainly
not.
the
entire
teaching
of
the
davis
and
calbeck
line
of
cases
is
that
state
and
federal
jurisdiction
is
concurrent.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
even
over
navigable
waters
in
those
areas
that
are
within
the
maritime
but
local
sphere.
so
this
does
not
displace
state
jurisdiction
to
any
degree.
it
simply
alleviates
the
problems
and
the
confusion
that
are
inherent
in
forcing
workers
to
decide
in
advance
of
litigation
questions
that
courts
will
regularly
divide
upon.
indeed,
unless
this
court
adopts
the
position,
the
common
sense
position
that
all
work
on
the
water
is
by
its
very
nature
maritime,
thereby
conforming
the
judicial
construction
of
the
act
with
the
express
congressional
intent
behind
the
1972
amendments--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--the
calbeck
decision.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
the
davis
decision.
both
of
them
state
that.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
sun
ship
alludes
to
the
history
in
those
cases,
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes,
exactly.
unless
this
court
conforms
its
interpretation
of
the
act
with
the
express
congressional
intent,
it
will
once
again
be
embroiled
in
case
by
case
determinations
of
whether
particular
discrete
factual
employments
possess
an
elusive
connection
to
navigation
or
commerce.
for
example,
the
court
below
rejected
the
argument
that
respondent
churchill
was
engaged
in
maritime
employment
as
a
person
engaged
in
longshoring
operations...
that
is
the
statutory
language...
because
he
was
required
to
load
and
unload
caissons
from
supply
vessels.
the
fifth
circuit,
however,
on
virtually
identical
facts,
has
concluded
that
such
employees
are
engaged
in
maritime
employment,
and
two
petitions
currently
before
the
court
ask
this
court
to
settle
this
particular
controversy.
another
petition
currently
pending
before
the
court
questions
the
fourth
circuit's
conclusion
that
workers
injured
on
actual
navigable
waters
while
building
a
bridge
are
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
the
ninth
circuit
has
very
recently
determined
that
workers
injured
on
navigable
waters
building
bridges
are
not
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
in
short,
if
this
court
affirms
the
decision
below,
this
and
other
federal
courts
will
once
again
become
embroiled
in
determining
the
outer
limits
of
the
navigation
and
commerce
test,
an
attempt
that
will
almost
certainly
be
doomed
to
failure
because,
as
the
court
noted
in
calbeck,
there
has
never
been
any
method
of
staking
out
those
limits
except
in
litigation
in
particular
cases.
as
noted
in
a
leading
treatise
on
the
basis
that
there
can
be
nothing
more
maritime
than
the
sea,
every
employment
on
the
sea
or
other
navigable
waters
should
be
considered
maritime
employment.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--there
is
something...
it
is
unclear.
decisions
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
most
recently
in
the
drow
opinion,
which
adopts
our
position
in
full,
state
that
if
employees
are
not
covered
under
the
act,
they
would
retain
their
seriacki
cause
of
action.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
just
a
few
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
we'd
like
to
make
certain
that
there's
no
misunderstanding
regarding
the
standing
of
the
director
in
this
court.
28
u.s.c.
1254
plainly
allows
the
director
as
a
party
to
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
we
were
a
party
respondent
below.
there's
no
serious
case
or
controversy
question
in
this
case
because
respondent
churchill
is
before
the
case...
is
before
the
court.
he
will
either
receive
or
be
denied
benefits.
this
is
not,
as
the
valley
forge
case,
as
in
the
words
in
the
valley
forge
case,
a
mere
college
debating
forum.
we
have
very
little
to
add
on
the
merits
of
our
case
except
to
note
that
the
fifth
circuit
in
a
recent
en
banc
decision
voted
12
to
2
to
adopt
in
full
the
position
of
the
director.
as
mr.
justice
frankfurther
noted
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
davis:
"any
legislative
scheme
that
compensates
workmen
or
their
families
for
industrial
mishaps
should
be
capable
of
simple
and
dependable
enforcement.
"
we
urge
this
court
to
adopt
the
common
sense
view
that
employment
on
the
water
is
maritime,
rather
than
becoming
embroiled
in
formalistic
inquiries
as
to
whether
particular
employments
possess
that
elusive
connection.
thank
you.
