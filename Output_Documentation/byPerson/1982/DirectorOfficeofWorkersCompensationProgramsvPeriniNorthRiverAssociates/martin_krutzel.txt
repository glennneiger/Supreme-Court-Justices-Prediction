mr.
martin
krutzel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
issues
are
presented
for
your
consideration
today.
the
first
is
whether
the
director
of
the
office
of
workers
compensation
programs
is
a
proper
party
to
seek
review
of
the
second
circuit
decision
below
in
this
court.
the
second
is
whether
raymond
churchill
was
at
the
time
of
his
involvement
in
the
construction
of
a
substructure
for
a
sewage
treatment
plant
engaged
in
maritime
employment
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
act.
we
submit
that
the
article
iii,
section
2,
case
and
controversy
requirement
must...
in
satisfying
that
requirement,
the
director
must
show
that
he
has
suffered
an
injury
in
fact
or
have
a
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
decision
in
order
to
have
standing.
in
this
particular
case,
the
director
must
have
some
pecuniary
or
administrative
interest
which
has
been
adversely
affected
by
the
decision
below.
the
director
concedes,
i
believe,
that
there
was
no
pecuniary
involvement
on
behalf
of
the
office
of
workers'
compensation
programs
and
no
pecuniary
interest
which
could
be
adversely
affected
by
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
martin
krutzel
mr.
churchill
is
here
as
a
respondent.
if
the
director
is
found
not
to
have
proper
standing
to
seek
review
in
this
court,
no
benefits
could
be
paid
to
mr.
churchill.
the
clear
fact
is
that,
even
if
mr.
churchill
were
a
petitioner,
the
director
would
not
be
the
party,
and
the
government
would
not
be
the
party,
to
pay
any
benefits
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
case.
that
becomes
solely
the
responsibility
of
the
employer
and
the
insurance
carrier.
mr.
martin
krutzel
that
is
correct.
the
director
does,
however,
point
to
two
sections
of
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
for
authority
for
the
proposition
that
he
has
an
administrative
interest
which
provides
him
with
the
requisite
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
action.
he
points
specifically
to
section
39(c),
which
requires
that
the
director
provide
information
and
assistance
to
potential
claimants
under
the
act.
however,
that
section
does
not
require
that
the
director
has
to
agree
with
the
information
that
he
provides
to
employees
or
potential
compensation
claimants.
in
fact,
that
section
does
not
require
that
the
director
has
to
give
information
which
is
entirely
free
from
doubt.
it
simply
provides
that
he
must
give
information,
and
that
information,
we
presume,
would
be
based
upon
the
state
of
the
existing
law.
mr.
martin
krutzel
that
is
correct.
mr.
martin
krutzel
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
believe
that
the
federal
agency
has
in
fact
lost
the
case.
what
they
did
was
appear...
they
did
not
take
part
in
the
trial
of
the
case
before
the
administrative
law
judge
to
any
extent.
they
petitioned
for
review
before
the
benefits
review
board
as
a
party
in
interest
before
the
administrative
agency,
and
upon
the
benefits
review
board's
affirmance
of
the
fact
that
mr.
churchill
was
not
an
employee
engaged
in
maritime
employment
the
director
did
not
proceed
further
as
a
petitioner.
he
appeared
merely
as
a
respondent,
obviously
in
recognition
of
the
second
circuit's
position
that
he
did
not
have
standing
to
seek
review
in
the
federal
courts
as
a
petitioner.
should
the
court
in
this
case
not
reach
a
decision
on
the
merits,
the
director
can
still
give
the
same
information
and
advice
to
compensation
claimants
pursuant
to
his
responsibilities
under
section
39
of
the
act.
in
addition,
the
director
has
argued
today
and
in
his
reply
brief
that
self-insured
employers
who
are
required
to
make
certain
showings
to
the
secretary
of
labor
and
his
designee
the
director
pursuant
to
section
32
of
the
act
in
some
way
create
an
interest
in
the
director
which
would
satisfy
the
standing
requirement.
however,
certainly
that
section
of
the
law
is
not
relevant
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
as
the
employer,
perini
north
river
associates,
was
covered
by
insurance
contracts.
in
addition,
that
section
creates
no
affirmative
duty
on
behalf
of
the
director
to
do
anything.
that
section,
rather,
requires
employers
to
come
forward
and
provide
evidence
that
they
are,
if
going
to
be
self-insured,
capable
of
paying
compensation
claims.
and
certainly
even
that
section,
which
if
it
were
interpreted
to
require
the
director
to
provide
information
to
potential
employers
under
the
act,
is
subject
to
the
same
interpretation
in
that
the
director
does
not
have
to
agree
with
the
information
he
imparts.
that
is
not
what
the
law
requires.
the
director's
ability
to
dispense
information
in
this
case
will
not
be
enhanced
if
standing
is
accorded
in
this
case.
the
courts,
not
the
director,
will
ultimately
determine
the
meaning
of
the
law.
the
federal
courts,
in
order
to
hear
a
case,
must
have
and
must
require
that
concrete
adverseness
which
is
not
demonstrably
present
in
this
case.
we
do
not
argue
that
the
director
won't,
as
a
result
of
a
decision
on
the
merits,
be
able
to
give
more
certain
advice
and
information,
but
merely
that
his
function
as
the
transmitter
of
that
information
will
not
be
affected
by
the
outcome
of
the
decision
below.
mr.
martin
krutzel
i
think
that
the
court
has
certainly
appeared
to
take
jurisdiction
in
three
cases:
the
director
against--
mr.
martin
krutzel
--so
far
as
we
know
according
to
the
director's
reply
brief,
in
a
footnote
of
the
director,
in
the
matter
of
rasmussen
the
question
of
the
director's
standing
may
have
been
addressed.
to
our
knowledge,
there
has
been
no
full
briefing
and
arguments
on
the
question
of
the
director's
standing.
mr.
martin
krutzel
director
v.
walter
tanzen.
that
is
the
one
case
that
we
are
aware
of
where
the
director
was
the
sole--
mr.
martin
krutzel
--as
i
understand
it,
the
decision
of
this
court
vacated
and
remanded
based
upon
a
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
martin
krutzel
i
do
clearly
concede
that
it
appears
that
the
court
has
taken
jurisdiction
of
those
matters.
mr.
martin
krutzel
that
is
correct.
however,
as
i
understand
it
that
decision
did
not
involve
full
briefing
and
oral
arguments.
mr.
martin
krutzel
that
is
my--
mr.
martin
krutzel
--that
is
my
understanding.
in
addition,
the
second
circuit,
upon
remand
of
the
fusco
case,
which
had
initially
been
decided
the
same
day
as...
had
been
argued,
excuse
me,
the
same
day
as
director
against...
as
the
tanzen
case,
reaffirmed
its
position
that
the
director
was
not
a
proper
party
to
petition
this
court
for
review.
in
addition,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
donzi
marine
case,
which
held
that
the
director
could
not
properly
petition
a
federal
court
for
review,
that
circuit
reaffirmed
that
analysis
just
recently
in
1982
in
the
miller
case.
those
decisions
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
court
of
appeals,
at
least
the
second
and
the
fifth
circuit,
have
not
seen
this
court's
action
with
respect
to
director
v.
tanzen
as
resolving
the
question
of
the
director's
standing
to
seek
review.
the
director
in
his
reply
brief
has
argued
that
his
interest
in
the
proper
construction
and
application
of
the
act
is
in
and
of
itself
sufficient
to
grant
him
standing
each
and
every
time
that
he,
the
director,
is
of
the
opinion
that
a
court
has
incorrectly
adjudicated
a
particular
claim.
by
this
argument
he
is
asking
no
more
than
the
right
to
seek
the
court's
advisory
opinions
whenever
he
disagrees
with
the
lower
court
decision.
in
this
case,
the
parties
with
a
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
action
have
chosen
not
to
litigate
further.
in
essence,
what
the
director
is
requesting
is
the
right
to
certify
questions
to
the
court
without
a
case
or
controversy.
the
second
issue
presented
today
is
whether
raymond
churchill,
engaged
in
the
construction
of
a
substructure
for
sewage
treatment
plant,
was
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
denying
federal
coverage
because
mr.
churchill's
activities
did
not
bear
a
realistically
significant
relationship
to
navigation
or
commerce
on
navigable
waters
was
correct
and
it
appropriately
applied
the
occupational
status
test
of
maritime
employment.
the
congressional
language
in
the
1972
amendments
clearly
shows
that
coverage
was
premised
upon
an
occupational
status
test
and
the
geographical
situs
test.
simply
stated,
the
act
requires
that
an
injured
worker
be
engaged
in
maritime
employment
on
navigable
waters.
the
legislative
history
and
the
court,
citing
language
from
the
legislative
history
in
the
computo
and
pfeiffer
cases,
clearly
shows
that
some
workers
injured
upon
the
covered
situs
would
not
be
covered
under
the
act
because
they
were
not
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
the
occupational
status
test
cannot,
we
submit,
appropriately
be
defined
with
respect
to
situs,
and
that
is
what
the
director
argues.
it
is
the
director's
contention
that
maritime
employment
includes
employment
upon
navigable
waters.
in
fact,
the
director
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
thibodaux
case
appear
to
take
the
position
that
employment
upon
pre-1972
navigable
waters
was
in
and
of
itself
maritime
employment.
we
submit,
however,
that
this
particular
assumption,
which
was
the
basis
for
the
thibodaux
decision,
cannot
be
sustained
by
resort
to
the
actual
wording
of
the
statute,
nor
can
it
be
sustained
by
resort
to
an
analysis
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
i
call
your
attention
to
this
court's
decision
in
pennsylvania
railroad
v.
o'rourke,
wherein
it
was
specifically
stated
that
the
coverage
of
the
act
was
not
based
upon
the
relationship
of
the
employee
to
maritime
employment,
but
rather
based
upon
injury
over
navigable
waters.
the
court
in
that
decision
stated
clearly,
especially
when
it
discussed
the
case
of
parker
v.
motor
boat
sales,
that
that
individual
would
not
be
covered
if
the
test
focused
upon
the
job
that
the
employee
was
engaged
for.
historically,
the
maritime
employment
standard
clearly
required
some
nexus
to
navigation
and
commerce
over
navigable
waters.
i
think
it
is
important,
though,
that
a
review
of
the
statutory
language
itself
does
not
support
the
director's
argument.
if
we
define
navigable
waters
by
seeing
that...
excuse
me.
if
we
define
maritime
employment
by
analyzing
the
term
and
stating
that
it
is
employment
upon
navigable
waters,
we
do
a
serious
disservice
to
section
2,
subdivision
(4)
of
the
act,
which
uses
both
terms,
"maritime
employment"
and
"navigation
and
commerce".
section
2(3)
always
discusses
maritime
employment
by
resort
to
the
nature
of
the
injured
worker's
occupation
and
never
based
upon
where
the
injured
employee
suffers
that
injury
in
the
covered
situs.
mr.
martin
krutzel
the
congressional
language
with
respect
to
"traditional
covered"
has
to
be
analyzed
in
context
of
the
history
of
the
act.
throughout
the
history
of
the
act,
and
i
think
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
makes
clear,
the
coverage
of
construction
workers
was
not
taken
for
granted
to
be
the
subject
of
the
act.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
the
inception
of
the
act
from
1927
at
least
to
the
advent
of
the
davis
decision,
there
was
clearly
a
controversy
concerning
whether
or
not
those
employees
could
be
provided
a
remedy
by
a
valid
state
act
and
thereby
not
be
within
the
reach
of
the
federal
act.
mr.
martin
krutzel
that
is
correct.
mr.
martin
krutzel
that
is
correct.
the
calbeck
decision
states
that
within
the
limits
of
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction,
the
act
could
reach
injuries
over
navigable
waters,
because
that
was
the
area
of
federal
concern,
that
being
the
area
where
navigation
and
commerce
takes
place.
this
does
not...
the
calbeck
decision
in
our
view
does
not
overrule
the
cases
which
preceded
it
in
terms
of
maritime
but
local,
but
only
serves
to
reinforce
the
then
accepted
principle
that
the
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction,
since
the
act
is
based
in
admiralty,
tort
and
contract
jurisdiction,
could
apply
to
injuries
over
navigable
waters,
that
being
the
area
of
the
federal
concern.
the
navigation
and
commerce
test
employed
by
the
second
circuit
below
does
satisfy
the
clearly
expressed
congressional
intention
to
cover
those
workers
in
the
class
of
its
concern,
again
the
class
being
those
involved
in
industries
relating
to
navigation
and
to
the
movement
of
cargo
from
water
to
shore.
the
examples
of
maritime
employment
contained
in
section
2,
subdivision
(3)
of
the
act
clearly
show,
although
they
may
not
be
all-inclusive,
that
maritime
employment
is
related
to
that
industry.
to
read
the
act
as
the
director
suggests
does
harm,
irreparable
violence,
in
our
view,
to
section
2,
subdivision
(4),
which
now
states
that:
"the
term
"employer"
means
an
employer
any
of
whose
employees
are
employed
in
maritime
employment
in
whole
or
in
part
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
"
to
read
that
section
with
the
director's
interpretation
of
the
act
would
change
the
language
to
be:
"the
term
1972,
in
whole
or
in
part
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
"
we
submit
that
congress
in
enacting
the
1972
amendments
and
in
using
the
two
phrases,
"maritime
employment"
and
"navigable
waters",
intended
to
provide
distinct
and
separate
meanings
to
those
phrases.
historically,
the
area
of
federal
concern
did
relate
to
navigation
and
commerce.
there
is
no
question
that
in
a
number
of
decisions
interpreting
the
1972
act
this
court
has,
particularly
when
discussing
the
maritime
but
local
cases,
required
a
nexus
between
the
activity
and
traditional
concepts
of
navigation
and
commerce
on
navigable
water.
this
court's
decisions
in
calbeck
and
nacirema
make
it
clear
that
the
scope
of
the
1927
act
required
coverage
for
employees
injured
over
actual
navigable
waters.
it
was
clearly
stated
in
the
nacirema
decision
that
the
language
of
the
statute...
that
is,
the
language
that
congress
in
1927
employed...
arbitrarily
eliminated
from
coverage
many
employees
whose
work
did
affect
navigation
and
commerce,
particularly
so
in
view
of
the
advent
of
modern
cargo-handling
techniques
which
brought
much
of
the
longshoremen's
usual
work
onto
to
shore.
the
court
in
nacirema
suggested
that
congress
could
extend
coverage
shoreward
based
upon
its
power
over
admiralty
contract
jurisdiction,
providing
that
the
parties
cover
the
status
of
the
longshoremen
performing
that
maritime
contract.
and
this
court's
decisions
in
executive
jet,
decided
after
the
1972
amendments
in
19...
later
that
year...
showed
that
the
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction
has
now
been
rationalized
with
this
court's
discussion
of
admiralty
contract
jurisdiction,
so
that
both
require
a
nexus
to
traditional
navigation
or
commerce
over
navigable
waters.
the
1972
amendments
show
that
congress
accepted
this
court's
invitation
in
nacirema
to
cure
the
arbitrary
application
of
the
act
by
providing
that
they
will
cover
now
for
the
first
time
the
status
of
the
injured
worker
and
not
simply
refer
to
the
location
of
that
injury.
congress
therefore
expanded
the
situs
of
coverage
to
eliminate
the
situation
of
shifting
and
fortuitous
coverage,
as
was
renounced
certainly
in
the
dissent
in
nacirema
and
also
alluded
to
by
the
majority
opinion.
for
the
first
time,
congress
confined
the
recovery
to
those
individuals
which
it
affirmatively
described
as
the
subject
class
of
its
concern,
and
the
examples
make
clear
that
that
class
was
individuals
whose
work
affected
navigation
and
commerce
over
navigable
waters.
now,
the
director
has
argued
that
the
standard
adopted
by
the
court
below,
which
is
that
the
work
must
have
some
relationship,
significant
relationship
to
traditional
navigation
and
commerce
over
navigable
waters,
is
unworkable.
but
it
is
clear
that
in
adopting
the
occupational
status
test
congress
required
that
the
inquiry
be
made
in
each
case
regarding
whether
this
employee's
activities
are
in
the
area
that
congress
was
concerned
with
protecting.
even
the
director's
test
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
navigation
and
commerce
test
would
be
required
at
least,
in
his
view,
to
those
employees
who
were
injured
on
the
covered
shoreside
area,
although
he
intends
that
a
different
test,
a
situs
test
of
maritime
employment,
be
used
to
determine
coverage
for
injuries
over
pre-1972
navigable
waters.
the
director's
test
would
arbitrarily,
apparently,
exclude
from
coverage
an
employee
whose
status...
who
would
fail
the
maritime
occupational
status
test
while
on
shore,
but
apparently
cover
the
same
employee
if
he
happened
to
fall
into
the
water.
that
is
precisely
the
dilemma
that
congress
attempted
to
cure
in
the
1972
amendments
by
no
longer
focusing
the
area
of
concern
on
the
situs,
but
rather
looking
to
the
actual
work
that
the
injured
worker
performed.
we
submit
that
the
standard
adopted
by
the
court
below
is
flexible
enough
to
accommodate
any
new
changes
in
cargo-handling
techniques
that
injured
workers
may
come
into
effect
with,
and
we
submit
that
the
standard
focuses
upon
the
industry,
the
purpose
of
which
congress
was
concerned,
that
being
the
movement
of
goods
in
maritime
commerce
or
navigation.
i
should
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
director
has
made
reference
to
one
particular
case
in
the
second
circuit
which
he
indicates
creates
some
conflict
even
within
the
circuit
concerning
coverage
for
employees
at
this
construction
project.
he
mentions
specifically
matson
v.
perini
north
river
associates,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
second
circuit
did
not
reach
a
decision
on
the
merits
in
that
case.
thank
you.
