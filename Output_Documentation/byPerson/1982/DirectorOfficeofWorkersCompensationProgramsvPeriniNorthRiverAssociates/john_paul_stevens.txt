justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
stop
you
right
there,
mr.
wilkins?
it
is
generally
assumed
that
the
act
would
apply...
anything
over
maritime,
over
navigable
waters.
if
this
were
a
pier
extending
out
into
the
water,
work
on
the
pier
would
not
have
been
covered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
a
sewage
treatment
plant
be
like
a
pier?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wilkins,
in
this
very
case,
if
this
employee
worked
sometimes
on
the
barge
and
sometimes
on
the
partially
completed
structure,
would
he
be
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage
under
your
view
of
the
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
he
had
been
working
on
the
partially
completed
structure,
he
would
not
have
been
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
take
another
employee
with
slightly
different
duties.
say
he
worked
on
the
partially
completed
structure
60
percent
of
the
time,
but
then
had
to
go
on
the
barge
part
of
the
time.
would
that
employee
walk
in
and
out
of
coverage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
pizza
delivery
person,
though,
would
walk
in
and
out
of
coverage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
what
percentage
of
their
time
has
to
be
on
navigable
waters
to
avoid
the
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
argument...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
it,
because
a
big
part
of
your
argument
is,
we
are
talking
about
people
who
were
clearly
covered
before
the
'72
amendment.
now,
if
we
had
somebody
who
spent
80
percent
of
his
time
on
the
partially
completed
structure,
he
would
not
have
been
clearly
covered
prior
to
the
1972
amendments
for
80
percent
of
his
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
prior
to
1972,
he
would
have
walked
in
and
out
of
coverage.
now,
why
doesn't
he
walk
in
and
out
of
coverage
now,
again?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
amphibious
workers
who
build
sewage
treatment
plants?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
your
third
argument
is
not
valid
unless
you
win
that
other
case.
your
third
argument
is,
we
get
away
from
the
walking
in
and
out
of
coverage
problem
by
adopting
your
construction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wilkins,
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
on
this
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
sustaining
the
government's
position
in
this
case
mean
that
there
would
be
no
recovery
under
a
state
workmen's
compensation
statute
for
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
tell
me
what
case
it
is
that
holds
that
state
recovery
is
all
right
even
if
it
is
seaward
of
the
jensen
line?
justice
john
paul
stevens
calbeck.
justice
john
paul
stevens
clearly
sun
ship
doesn't
say
that.
