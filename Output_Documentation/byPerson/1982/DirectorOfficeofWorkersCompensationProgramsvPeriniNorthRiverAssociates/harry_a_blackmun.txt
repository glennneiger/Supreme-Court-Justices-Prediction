justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
churchill
did
not
petition
for
cert,
did
he?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
know
why?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
i
know,
but
he...
if
there
is
jurisdiction
here,
it
has
to
be
because
you
petitioned.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
it
would
have
been
so
simple
for...
is
there
any
barrier
to
his
petitioning
for
cert?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--mr.
wilkins,
let
me
go
back
to
that
last
quotation.
would
that
mean
that
a
delivery
man
delivering
something
to
mr.
churchill
on
his
barge
would
be
covered?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
if
he
were
bringing
a
pizza
out
to
mr.
churchill
for
lunch,
he
would
be
covered?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
isn't
mr.
churchill
here
as
a
party?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
would
eliminate
mr.
churchill
by
reason
of
the
fact
he
didn't
petition
for
cert?
