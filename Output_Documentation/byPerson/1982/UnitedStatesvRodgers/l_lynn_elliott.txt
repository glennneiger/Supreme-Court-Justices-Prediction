mr.
l.
lynn
elliott
mr.
chief
justice,
and
it
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court,
i
had
announced
i
had
a
voice
problem.
i
didn't
know
that
it
was
this
serious.
can
i
be
heard?
can
you
hear
me?
mr.
l.
lynn
elliott
all
right.
mr.
l.
lynn
elliott
i
will
try
very
hard,
sir.
i
represent,
of
course,
mrs.
ingram,
the
companion
case
to
the
rodgers
case,
and
mr.
elliott
has
stated
for
me
and
on
our
behalf
our
position
with
regard
to
the
homestead
rights
as
they
are
interpreted
under
texas
law,
and
as
they
have
been
interpreted
by
this
court,
and
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
making
determinations
that
the
homestead
right
is
a
separate
estate
in
property
under
the
texas
constitution,
which
differs
considerably
from
a
joint
tenancy
or
a
tenancy
in
common,
which
are
not
estates
or
property
rights
that
are
popular
or
known
in
texas,
unless
it
be
as
a
part
of
a
partnership,
part
of
a
written
agreement.
we
do
not
have
those
characteristics
of
real
property
in
texas.
the
homestead
right--
mr.
l.
lynn
elliott
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
lynn
elliott
your
honor,
specifically,
by
constitutional
amendment,
a
single
person
in
texas
was
given
the
same
homestead
right
as
a
married
person,
and
to
say
that
mrs.
ingram's
homestead
rights
ceased
on
her
divorce
is
an
inaccurate
statement
with
regard
to
the
law
in
texas.
that
is
not
the
law
in
texas.
mr.
l.
lynn
elliott
if
that's
what
he
said,
i
would
disagree,
your
honor,
yes.
the
homestead
right
of
the
divorced
spouse
in
this
particular
case
happened
to
be
the
subject
matter
of
a
property
settlement
agreement
which
granted
that
property
to
the
wife
in
that
case...
in
this
particular
case.
the
taxpayer,
don
ingram,
we
are
not...
there
has
never
been
any
contention
that
his
interest
is
not...
in
the
property
is
not
subject
to
the
government's
lien.
likewise,
there
was
a
matter
of
some
$288
worth
of
joint
tax
liability
which
we
have
no
problem
with,
and
their
money
is
on
deposit
in
a
bank
in
dallas
to
pay
the
joint
tax
liability
to
the
extent
of
$288.
the...
i
wanted
to
point
out
in
relation
to
questions
asked
by
perhaps
judge
blackmun
that
we
do
not
feel
that
the
marketability
of
the
property
is
a
problem
for
the
taxpayer.
the
marketability
of
the
interest
should
be
the
government's
exclusive
problem.
in
this
case,
at
the
district
court
level
and
at
the
fifth
circuit
level,
the
government
has
taken
the
position
not
that
they
want
one-half
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale.
they
want
to
be
able
to
sell
these
properties
and
take
whatever
they
are
in...
the
lien
amounts
due,
and
it
might
be
more
than
100
percent
even
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
the
property.
the
question
is
not
before
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
property
is
to
be
sold
and
the
proceeds
divided
equally.
we
tried
to
make
that
kind
of
a
deal,
and--
mr.
l.
lynn
elliott
thank
you,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
say
to
the
court
that
mr.
bill
elliott
and
i
have
conferred
with
regard
to
justice
o'connor's
question
regarding
the
effect
of
a
divorce
on
community
property,
and
mr.
bill
elliott
agrees
with
me
that
a
divorce
will...
could
affect
a...
the
homestead
right
of
a
party
if
in
effect,
as
in
this
case,
donald
ingram
gave
up
his
homestead
right
by
conveying
it
to
his
spouse,
but
a
divorce
as
such
does
not
per
se
affect
the
homestead
rights
of
either
parties.
it
is
something
that
must
agreed
to
or
disposed
of
at
time
of
the
divorce.
obviously,
if
one
party
moves
to
another
place,
it
would
probably
be
said
that
that
party
has
abandoned
the
homestead,
in
light
of
the
rule
that
one
person
may
have
only
one
homestead,
not
two.
the
party
remaining
in
the
home
would
have...
the
homestead
rights
would
continue
with
the
residency
and
the
possession
of
that
property,
unless
by
some
affirmative
act
they,
the
party
disavows
the
homestead
right.
again,
in
this
particular
case,
the
author
of
the
opinion
in
the
fifth
circuit,
judge
jerry
williams,
was
a
university
of
texas
professor
before
he
was
appointed
to
the
bench,
and
taught
real
properly,
among
other
courses
there,
and
when
he...
in
his
opinion
he
describes
the
homestead
right
as
being
one
that
was
actually
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
determination
of
whether
there
was
abandonment
or
not.
that
was
the
decision
in
the
fifth
circuit.
it
may
be
a
question
that,
why
did
the
district
court,
the
same
judge,
the
honorable
william
mac
taylor,
heard
both
of
these
cases
within
a
two
weeks'
period
of
time,
and
had
a
different
result.
he
granted
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
one
case,
and
the
taxpayers
or
the
non-taxpayer
spouse
motion
in
the
other
case.
it
had
already
been
predetermined
that
the
case,
both
cases
would
be
appealed.
his
attitude
was,
i've
got
to
be
right
in
one
of
the
cases,
so
that
is
why
it
was
done
that
way.
he
announced
that
at
the
time.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
l.
lynn
elliott
yes.
and
taylor
didn't
want
to
try
any
more
jury
cases
because
he
is
going
to
be
leaving
the
bench,
and
he
didn't
want
to
get
strung
out
in
a
long
jury
trial.
in
this
case,
the
government's
position
has
been,
he
announced
that
that
was
not
my
opinion.
that
is
what
he
announced
at
the
time.
the
government's
position
is,
we
are
going
to
sell
this
property,
and
we
are
going
to
take
your
interest,
mrs.
ingram,
and
although
you
owe
no
taxes,
we
are
going
to
take
your
interest,
and
we
are
going
to
pay
your
husband's
tax
bill.
that
is
really
what
this
case
bottoms
out
on.
and
we
don't
believe
that
to
be
the
law
in
this
country,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
that
is
consistent
with
the
constitution
in
texas.
we
think
the
effect
of
a
decision
supporting
the
government's
position
as
it
is
very
narrowly
stated
would
have
the
effect
of
abrogating
the
texas
constitution
in
its
pure
language,
and
the
texas
supreme
court
decisions
in
the
semonet
cases.
judge
taylor's
father
sat
on
the
texas
supreme
court.
that
is
the
case
that
held
the
texas
homestead
right
to
be
a
separate
vested
right
in
property,
and
not
subject
to
being
divested
except
in
those
manners
prescribed.
and
with
that,
i
conclude.
thank
you,
your
honors.
