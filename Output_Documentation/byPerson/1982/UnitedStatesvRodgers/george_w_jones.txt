mr.
george
w.
jones
no.
mr.
george
w.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
broadly
stated,
the
controlling
issue
in
these
cases
is
whether
the
homestead
rights
of
a
delinquent
taxpayer's
spouse
preclude
enforcement
of
a
federal
tax
lien
against
the
delinquent
taxpayer's
interest
in
the
homestead
property.
the
internal
revenue
service
made
substantial
tax
adjustments...
tax
assessments
against
respondent
rodgers'
husband
as
well
as
the
husband
of
respondent
ingram.
this
litigation
arises
from
the
government's
efforts
to
collect
those
taxes.
the
pertinent
facts
are
undisputed.
respondent
rodgers
and
her
former
husband,
philip
bosco,
were
married
in
1937.
in
1955,
they
purchased
the
real
property
involved
in
this
case.
the
property
was
community
property,
and
respondent
and
her
husband
claimed
the
property
as
a
homestead
under
texas
law.
in
1971
and
1972,
the
internal
revenue
service
made
assessments
against
philip
bosco
in
excess
of
$900,000
for
federal
wagering
taxes.
bosco
died
in
1974.
the
assessed
taxes
remain
unpaid.
respondent
rodgers
remarried,
and
she
now
occupies
the
property
with
her
new
husband.
the
government
filed
this
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
texas,
seeking
to
reduce
its
assessments
against
bosco
to
judgment
to
enforce
the
liens,
the
tax
liens
against
any
property
belonging
to
bosco,
and
to
secure
a
deficiency
judgment
for
any
unpaid
tax
liability
or
unsatisfied
tax
liability.
in
the
other
case,
respondent
ingram
and
her
husband,
donald
ingram,
acquired
real
property
during
their
marriage
that
they
claimed
as
a
homestead.
as
in
the
rodgers
case,
the
property
was
community
property.
in
1972
and
1973,
the
internal
revenue
service
made
assessments
against
donald
ingram
for
unpaid
taxes
withheld
from
the
wages
of
the
employees
of
a
company
of
which
donald
ingram
was
the
president.
the
unpaid
balance
of
the
assessments
is
about
$9,000.
in
connection
with
their
subsequent
divorce,
donald
ingram
conveyed
his
interest
in
the
homestead
properties
to
respondent
ingram.
after
unsuccessfully
attempting
to
dispose
of
the
properties,
respondent
ingram
and
the
trustee
for
the
properties
filed
this
action
against
the
united
states
and
several
other
ingram
creditors
in
state
court
to
quiet
title
to
the
property
and
to
remove
any
liens
encumbering
the
property.
the
united
states
removed
the
action
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
texas,
and
filed
a
counterclaim
seeking
enforcement
of
its
tax
liens.
donald
ingram
was
added
as
a
defendant
on
the
government's
counterclaim.
without
explanation,
the
district
court
refused
to
enforce
the
tax
liens
in
the
rodgers
case,
but
the
same
court
enforced
the
tax
liens
in
the
ingram
case.
on
appeal,
the
two
cases
were
consolidated
for
oral
argument.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
because
the
homestead
interest
of
a
spouse
is
characterized
as
a
property
interest
under
texas
law,
the
government
cannot
enforce
its
tax
lien
against
the
homestead
property
while
the
delinquent
taxpayer's
spouse
chooses
to
maintain
her
homestead
interest
in
the
property.
accordingly,
the
court
affirmed
the
judgment
for
respondent
rodgers
in
pertinent
part
and
reversed
the
judgment
for
the
government
against
respondent
ingram
in
pertinent
part.
the
questions
in
these
cases
are
matters
of
statutory
interpretation.
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
are
section
6334,
which
exempts
certain
classes
of
property
from
the
reach...
from
levy
for
federal
taxes,
section
6321,
which
creates
a
lien
against
all
property
belonging
to
a
delinquent
taxpayer
and
in
favor
of
the
government,
section
7403,
which
provides
for
a
civil
action
to
enforce
a
tax
lien
against
any
property
in
which
a
delinquent
taxpayer
has
any
right,
title,
or
interest.
except
for
the
very
narrow
exemptions
set
out
in
section
6334,
all
of
the
delinquent
taxpayer's
property
and
rights
in
property
are
subject
to
levy
to
satisfy
federal
tax
liens,
federal
tax
claims.
homestead
property
is
not
mentioned
in
section
6334,
nor
does
any
other
federal
statute
purport
to
exempt
such
property
from
federal
tax
claims.
state
laws
exempting
property
from
the
claims
of
private
creditors
are
wholly
ineffective
against
the
federal
government.
the
internal
revenue
service's
regulations
are
quite
explicit
on
this
point.
no
provision
of
a
state
law
may
exempt
property
or
rights
to
property
from
levy
for
the
collection
of
any
federal
tax.
thus,
property
exempt
from
execution
under
state
personal
or
homestead
exemptions...
exemption
laws
is
nevertheless
subject
to
levy
by
the
united
states
for
collection
of
its
taxes.
under
section
6321,
the
united
states
has
a
lien
on
all
property
and
rights
to
property
belonging
to
any
person
who
fails
to
pay
his
taxes
after
appropriate
demand.
whether
the
taxpayer--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--our
position
is
that
congress
has
authorized
the
attorney
general
to
file
suit
against
any
property
in
which
the
delinquent
taxpayer
has
an
interest,
and
our
position
is
that
there
may
be
circumstances,
not
present
here,
in
which
it
would
be
appropriate
to
sell
only
the
delinquent
taxpayer's
interest,
but
where
that
can't
be
done,
the
government
is
entitled
to
sell
the
entire
property
with
division
of
the
proceeds
as
the
means
of
accommodating
the
interest
of
any
other
parties
who
have
interest.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
essentially
correct.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
i
am
not
clear
that
the
mortgagee's
interest
in
your
property
would
be
sufficient
for
the
government's
tax
lien
to
attach.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
if
it
is,
congress
has
said
that
under
section
7403,
the
government
may
proceed
against
any
property
in
which
the
taxpayer
has
an
interest
or
in
which
the
government
has
a
lien.
now,
the
district
director
or
the
secretary
certainly
may
take
into
account
your
interest
in
the
property
or
any
other
interest
in
the
property
in
determining
whether
to
proceed
against
the
property
by
means
of
foreclosure
under
section
7403
or
by
administrative
levy,
but
once
the
district
director
or
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
made
that
determination,
congress
has
provided
for
enforcement
of
the
tax
lien.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
the
easement
might
be
marketable
independent
of
the
property,
and
it
might
be
permissible
to
attempt
to
sell
the
easement
without
selling
your
property
as
well.
mr.
george
w.
jones
where
that
is
possible,
where
there
is
a
separate
market
for
the
property,
the
government
may
indeed
decide
to
proceed
in
that
manner.
mr.
george
w.
jones
the
reason
is
that
there
is
no
separate
market
for
mr.
rodgers'
fractional
interest--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--well,
i
said
there
is
no
separate
market
for
a
fractional
interest
of
the
sort
involved
in
this
case.
the
sale--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--well,
this
case
is
quite
different
from
the
hypotheticals
you
posed,
because
under
texas
law
community
property
under
the
joint
control
of
both
spouses
is
subject
to
the
claims
of
creditors
of
either
spouse
for
debts
incurred
during
the
marriage,
and
therefore
our
position
is
that
mrs.
rodgers
isn't
entitled
to
any
part
of
the
proceeds
in
this
case.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
correct,
without
mrs.
rodgers'
consent.
mr.
george
w.
jones
because
in
enforcing
its
lien,
the
government
doesn't
simply
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
delinquent
taxpayer.
mr.
george
w.
jones
justice
blackmun,
the
government's
position
is
only
that
congress
decides
what
property
is
exempt
from
levy.
congress
has
not
provided
an
exemption
for
homestead
property.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
mrs.
rodgers
is
being
denied
nothing
that
she
is
entitled
to.
mr.
george
w.
jones
the
government
is
entitled
to
the
rights
congress
has
provided.
under
section
7403--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--well,
congress
created
a
lien
on
the
property
for
the
payment
of
the
taxes,
and
under
section
7403,
the
government
is
entitled
to
enforce
that
lien
by
forcing
sale
of
the
property
and
division
of
the
proceeds
in
accordance
with
the
respective
interests
of
any
other
parties
who
have
claims
against
the
property.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
state
law
defines--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
state
law
says
that
the
husband
had
a
property
interest,
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
each
of
the
delinquent
taxpayers
in
these
cases
had
an
undivided
one-half
interest
in
the
property.
in
addition,
however,
under
texas
law,
community
property
is
subject
to
the
claims
of
creditors
for
debts
incurred
during
the
marriage.
it
appears
therefore
that
in
texas
both
spouses
have
a
sufficient
property
interest
in
all
community
property
to
subject
it,
the
property
to
the
claims
of
any
creditors
of
either
one
of
them.
to
further
answer
justice
o'connor's
question,
where
there
is
no
interest,
or
no
separate
market
for
a
fractional
interest,
both
the
taxpayer
and
the
government
would
be
harmed
or
suffer
detriment
by
attempting
to
sell
just
the
fractional
interest.
mr.
george
w.
jones
if
there
were
a
separate
market
for
a's
half
of
the
property,
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
need
to
sell
both
interests,
but
if
there
wasn't,
the
government
would
be
entitled
to
have
the
entire
property
sold
and
division
of
the
proceeds
in
accordance
with
the
interests
of
a
and
b.
mr.
george
w.
jones
no,
the
focus
of
the
1936
amendments
was
on
providing...
amendments
to
section
7403
was
on
providing
an
effective
remedy
for
foreclosure
against
personal
property,
and
congress--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--well,
i
don't
know
how
many
cases.
there
is
at
least
one.
in
herndon,
the
government
levied
on
homestead
property
even
though
under
the
law
of
the
state
the
taxpayer
would
have
no
right
to
sell
his
interest
in
the
property
without
the
consent
of
his
spouse.
the
government
in
enforcing
a
lien
exercises
the
rights
congress
has
provided.
it
is
not
an
assignee
of
the
taxpayer.
and
contrary
to
the
suggestion
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
case
of
folsom,
the
government
is
not
obliged
to
first
acquire
the
taxpayer's
interest
and
then
attempt--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
answer
that
question,
because
the
rights
of
a
lienholder
would
be,
except
for
the
federal
government,
would
be
determined
by
state
law,
and
that
would
depend
of
the
law
of
the
particular
state
in
which
the
lien
is
asserted.
mr.
george
w.
jones
i
am
not
aware
of
any
circumstances
where
the
question
has
come
up,
but
it
is
fairly
well
established
that
state
exemptions
don't
provide
any
obstacle
to
the
government's
attempts
to
enforce
its
tax
liens.
here,
there
is
assertedly
a
joint
owner
of
the
property.
the
government
is
attempting
to
enforce
its
lien
against
the
property
interest
of
the
delinquent
taxpayer.
in
order
to
do
that,
the
entire
property
must
be
sold,
because,
as
i
mentioned
before,
there
is
no
separate
interest
or
separate
market
for
the
homestead
property
which
a
tax
sale
purchaser
couldn't
do
anything
with
under
state
law.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
for
an
easement,
there...
an
easement,
as
i
remember
from
law
school,
may
well
be
of
value
to
individuals
other
than
the
person
holding
it,
and
they
are
transferrable,
unless
there
is
a
limitation
in
the
document
granting
the
easement,
and
it
may
well
be
that
an
easement
can
be
sold
without
interfering
with
your
interest
in
the
property
at
all.
mr.
george
w.
jones
and
if
it
can't--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that
is
absolutely
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
true,
and
all
of
those
factors
are--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that
is--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--no,
there
is
a
difference,
i
think,
between
saying
that
a
property...
that
a
particular
fractional
interest
is
unmarketable
because
no
one
would
be
willing
to
buy
it
and
saying
that
the
taxpayer's
interest
is
without
value.
here,
it
is
clear
beyond
any
question
that
both
of
the
delinquent
taxpayers
had
an
undivided
one-half
interest,
50
percent
interest
in
the
homestead
property.
in
addition,
and
just
as
to
that,
the...
well,
and
in
addition,
the
rodgers
homestead
is
estimated
to
be
worth
about
$150,000,
so
the
government
is
entitled
to
at
least
50
percent
of
the
proceeds
of
any
sale.
our
point
is
that
attempting
to
sell
mr.
rodgers'
one-half
interest
that
a
tax
sale
purchaser
couldn't
do
anything
with
until
mrs.
rodgers
decided
to
abandon
the
homestead
or
for
some
other
reason
terminated,
because
nobody
would
be
interested
in
buying
this
one-half
interest,
or
at
least
there
is
no
established
market
for
it,
because
of
the
limitations
on
its
use,
we
say
that
the
only
way
the
government
and
the
interests
of
the
taxpayer
can
be
served
is
by
selling
the
entire
property
and
dividing
the
proceeds
among
the
respective
claimants
to
the
property.
and
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
the
accommodation
congress
intended
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
or
these
cases.
the
fifth
circuit
has
taken
the
position
that
under
7403,
the
only
thing
that
can
be
sold
is
the
taxpayer's
interest
in
the
property.
every
other
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
that
question
has
rejected
the
fifth
circuit's
position.
the
fifth
circuit's
reading
of
7403
is
based,
we
submit,
on
a
misapprehension
of
the
rights
of
the
government
under
7403.
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--excuse
me?
mr.
george
w.
jones
yes.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right,
but
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--and
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
the
exact...
exactly
the
same
reasoning,
and
applied
it
in
this
case.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
but
it
is
well
settled
that
state
laws
exempting
property
from
the
claims
of
private
creditors
are
simply
ineffective
against
the
federal
government.
so
this
case
in
pertinent
part,
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
relevant
facts
in
this
case
are
no
different
from
folsom.
what
you
have
are
joint
owners
of
property,
one
of
the
joint
owners
being
a
delinquent
taxpayer,
and
the
question
is
to
what
extent
the
government
is
entitled
to
sell
the
interests
of
the
non-delinquent
taxpayer
in
order
to
maximize
the
return
of
the
sale
or
the
proceeds
of
its
sale
to
the
benefit
of
both
the
government's
tax
collection
efforts
and
the
interest
of
the
taxpayer
in
satisfying
his
tax
liability.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
focused
on
the
non-delinquent
taxpayer's
interest
in
the
property.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
if
the
delinquent
taxpayer's
homestead
rights
are
characterized
as
property
rights
under
state
law,
the
government
cannot
enforce
a
concededly
valid
lien
against
the
property
until
the
delinquent
taxpayer's
spouse
decides
to
abandon
his
homestead.
whatever
the
amount
of
the
taxpayer's
liability,
and
however
valuable
the
property,
the
government
is,
according
to
the
fifth
circuit,
powerless
to
enforce
its
lien
against
the
property.
we
submit
that
this
court's
decisions
establish
the
proposition
that
if
the
delinquent
taxpayer
has
an
interest
that
constitutes
property
under
state
law,
the
federal
lien
attaches,
and
the
lien
is
enforceable
under
7403.
the--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--whether
it
is
enforceable.
here,
the--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--well--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--it
is
not
clear
that
that
is
true
but--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--well,
there's--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--well,
whatever
that
is,
but--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that's
right.
there
are
some...
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
the
delinquent
taxpayers
here
owned
at
least
50
percent
of
the
property.
the
other
question
is,
how
much
more
than
that
the
government
is
entitled
to.
but
although
the
court
of
appeals
purported
to...
how
much...
under
state
law,
whether
his
rights
in
the
community
property
are
sufficient
to
constitute
property,
and
whether
the
government's
tax
lien
would
attach
to
the
entire
property
because
of
the
rights
accorded--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that's
right,
and
although
the
court
of
appeals
purported
to
leave
open
the
possibility
that
at
some
point
the
government
might
be
allowed
to
enforce
its
lien,
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
value
of
the
liens
won't
be
substantially
eroded
in
the
meantime,
and
furthermore,
the
liens
might
be
lost
altogether,
either
because
the
government
fails
to
keep
track
of
this
woman,
the
taxpayers'
spouses,
or
fails
to
keep
track
of
the
proceeds
of
any
disposition
of
the
properties.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that
is
true,
but
it
is
not
quite
clear
how...
which
of
those
alternatives
would
be
pursued,
and
whether
the
government
would
ever
be
paid
without
reasserting
its
rights.
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
the
lien
attached
to
the
homestead,
and
that
the
homestead
rights
of
the
spouse
would
continue
to
protect
the
homestead
from
enforcement
of
the
lien
for
as
long
as
mrs.
rodgers
maintained
the
homestead,
even
if
she
maintained
her
homestead
by
substituting
another
property,
okay,
or
selling
this
property
and
then
investing
the
proceeds
in
something
else.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
and--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--i
have
no
basis
for
disagreeing
with
that
assertion
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
is
not
a
question...
that
is
no
anything
to
question--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that's
right,
and
that's
why
i
was
not
quite
as
sanguine
about
the
possibilities
of
the
government
collecting
upon
the
sale.
federal
tax
liens
are
enforceable
against
all
of
the
delinquent
taxpayer's
property.
congress
has
provided
for
the
sale
of
any
property
in
which
the
delinquent
taxpayer
has
an
interest
and
for
division
of
the
proceeds
as
the
means
of
accommodating
the
interest
of
any
co-owners
of
the
property.
mr.
george
w.
jones
for
purposes
of
selling
the
property?
mr.
george
w.
jones
i
think
so.
mr.
george
w.
jones
subject
to
division
of
the
proceeds
for
whatever
value
the
life
estate
would
have
had.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
congress
has
provided
for
the
means--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--of
accommodating
the
interests
of
any
people
who
have
interest
in
the
property
other
than
the
taxpayer.
mr.
george
w.
jones
it
is
not
precisely
a
life
estate
case,
because--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--right,
for
so
long
as
she
chooses
to
use
it,
and
she
could
move
and
abandon
it.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
in
order
to
maintain
her
life
estate
in
the
property,
she
has
to
continue
to
occupy
the
property.
mr.
george
w.
jones
so
it
is
different
in
that
respect.
