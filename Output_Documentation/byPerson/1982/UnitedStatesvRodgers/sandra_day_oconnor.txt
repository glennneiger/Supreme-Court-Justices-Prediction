sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
that
in
fact
what
the
government
does,
is
sell
the
interest
of
their
holding
of
the
easement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
can't
the
government
in
this
case
sell
mr.
rodgers'
interest,
mr.
rodgers'
estate's
interest
in
the
homestead,
which
is
basically
an
interest
that
will
become
possessory
after
mrs.
rodgers
either
dies
or
gives
up
the
homestead?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
do
you
know
that?
if
mrs.
rodgers
is
elderly,
and
isn't
going
to
live
long,
and
the
property
has
substantial
value,
how
can
you
say
there
is
no
interest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
can't
keep
any
more
than
the
value
of
the
easement
in
the
rodgers
case,
you
couldn't
keep
any
more
then
than
the
value
of
mr.
rodgers'
estate's
interest.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
you
have
asserted
is
very
small.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
homestead
interest
attach
in
texas
law
to
the
property
acquired
in
substitution
for
the
original
homestead
property?
does
the
homestead
roll
over
into
the
new
property?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
your
view
of
texas
law
on
that
point?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
under
texas
law,
i
suppose
the
survivor
needn't
even
live
on
the
homestead
in
order
to
preserve
it,
but
could
rent
it
out
to
others.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
still
maintain
the
homestead.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
it
is
sold?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
an
abandonment,
if
it
is
sold?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
there
is
a
divorce,
it
is
terminated.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
a
joint
tenancy,
with
right
of
survivorship?
no,
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--why
couldn't,
under
your
theory,
the
government
at
least
try
to
market
the
non-possessory
interest
of
the
taxpayer,
sell
it
and
use
the
proceeds
of
that
sale
to
satisfy
its
lien?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
elliott--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--your
predecessor,
mr.
william
elliott,
indicated
that
under
texas
law
the
homestead
terminates
on
the
divorce.
why
then
in
the
case
of
the
ingram
situation
would
the
government
be
precluded
from
reaching
the
taxpayer's
interest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
disagree
with
mr.
william
elliott
on
that
point?
