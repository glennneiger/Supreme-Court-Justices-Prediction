which
may
not
be
very
much.
if
you
can't
sell
it,
it
is
not
worth
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
probably
wouldn't
be
selling
the
property
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
here
isn't
whether
the
lien
is
good.
the
question
is,
when
can
it
be
enforced.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
not
whether.
it
ultimately
and
inevitably
will
be
enforced.
the
lady
has,
under
state
law,
has
a
life
estate
in
the
property.
she
has
got
the
right
to
occupy
it
during
her
lifetime.
when
she
dies,
the
lien
will
still
be
good,
won't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
she
wants
to
sell
it,
the
lien
will
have
to
be
satisfied.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
anybody
suggesting
that
the
lien
is
invalid
here?
the
lien
will
have
to
be
satisfied
up
to
his
share
of
the
value
of
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
all
you
can
get
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
attach
to
the
entire
property,
but
you...
if
you
were
allowed
to
foreclose
this
lien,
all
you
would
get
to
satisfy
your
lien
is
the
value
of
his
interest
in
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
filed...
if
you
actually
recorded
your
lien,
anybody
who
is
going
to
buy
that
property
is
not
going
to...
they
are
either
going
to
pay
a
lesser
price
if
the
property
is
going
to
be
subject
to
the
lien,
or
they
are
going
to
insist
on
its
being
satisfied
so
they
can
get
clear
title.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
rule
that
if
there
was
a
substitution,
that
your
lien
would
have
to
attach
to
the
substituted
property.
they
didn't
say
you
couldn't
collect
on
your
lien
right
then,
did
they?
because
there
was
no
occasion
to
rule
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
life
estate
case,
isn't
it?
among
other
things,
a
homestead
interest
entitles
a
person,
the
lady
in
this
case,
to
occupy
the
property
for
her
lifetime.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
it
isn't
precisely,
but
she
has
an
interest
during
her
lifetime
that
her
heirs
will
not
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
an
interest
over
and
above
a
half-interest
in
the
property,
as
justice
stevens
indicated.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
distinguish
the
joint
tenancy?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
same
with
undivided
interests,
other
undivided
interests
in
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
tenants
in
common?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
it
is
the
peculiarities
of
texas
homestead
law.
i
suppose
if
they
had
the
same
provisions
with
respect
to
some
other
estates
on
joint
tenants,
that
each
party...
they
gave
the
same
rights
to
each
of
the...
what
if
a
joint
tenant
has
died?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
taxpayer...
the
joint
tenant
dies
when
he
is
a
taxpayer.
he
owes
some
taxes
when
he
dies.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
taxpayer
no
longer
has
a
right
to
possess.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
say
a
joint
tenancy
with
a
right
of
survivorship
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
was
subject
to
a
lien.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
lien
is
destroyed,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
your
rationale
is
going
to
support...
you
get
the
same
result
in
joint
tenancy
with
a
right
of
survivorship
as
you
will
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
there
is
a
conflict
among
the
circuits.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
most
joint
tenancies
are
with
right
of
survivorship,
and
so
you
are
really
talking
about
that
category
of
cases,
too,
as
well
as
homesteads.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
tenants
of
entirety?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
the
homestead,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
suggest
at
all
that...
nothing
in
your
position
would
indicate
that
the
lien
is
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
it
would
ever
become
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
is
going
to
be
collectable
no
later
that
the
end
of
her
life.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
when
she
sells
it,
you
say
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
abandons
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
she
swapped.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
she
would
have
a
homestead
in
the
substitute
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wouldn't
be
protected
against
this
lien.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
go
back
to
the
joint
tenancy
with
right
of
survivorship.
you
say
the
law
of
texas
is
that
the
one
joint
tenant
can't
force
the
sale
of
the
property
and
the
partition.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
both
joint
tenants
are
alive.
the
government
has
a
tax
lien
on
the
property
by
virtue
of
the
unpaid
taxes
of
one
of
the
joint
tenants,
and
it
wants
to
foreclose.
may
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
talking
about
not
only
where
a
joint
tenant
is
deceased,
but
at
any
time
there
is
a
joint
tenancy
with
right
of
survivorship,
the
government
may
not
foreclose
on
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly
there
are
a
lot
of...
there
are
plenty
of
cases,
aren't
there,
or
maybe
not
so
many,
that
so
permit
the
government
to
foreclose
during
the
lifetime
of
one
of
the
joint
tenants.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
talk
about
the
joint
tenancy.
i
don't
understand
now.
may
the
government
foreclose
to
collect
its
taxes
where
there
is
a
joint
tenancy
and
a
right
of
survivorship?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
but
how
about
during
his
lifetime?
that
is
what
i
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
joint
tenant
who
owes
the
taxes
could
not
force
a
sale
of
the
sale
of
the
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
now
suggesting
that
if
one
joint
tenant
who
owes
the
taxes
dies,
the
government
lien
ends.
a
while
ago
you
said
the
government
never
loses
its
lien.
and
that
it
would
just
attach
to
the
property.
it
was
only
a
question
of
time.
now
you
are
suggesting
that
in
joint
tenancy
cases,
the
government's
interest
expires.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
he
is
dead,
he
doesn't
have
any
property
interest,
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
the
lien
expires.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
the
only
property
that
it
attached
to.
so
now
you
are
saying
that
your
rule
means
the
government
loses
its
lien
upon
the
death
of
a
joint
tenant.
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
got
a
hard
row
to
hoe
there.
