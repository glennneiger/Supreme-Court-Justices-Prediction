we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
rodgers.
mr.
jones...
do
we
have
someone
missing
here?

mr.
jones,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
elliott?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
are
saying
that
there
is
nothing
here
that
will
defeat
the
federal
government's
right
to
collect
the
tax.
it
merely
is
deferring
the
date,
deferring
the
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
interest
these
days
on
federal
delinquent
taxes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
a
fee
owner
conveys
property
to
the
ford
foundation
or
through
his
local
church,
reserving
a
life
estate
in
himself,
and
then
incurs
the
tax
liability.
is
the
tax...
well,
what
is
the
consequence
in
terms
of
the
tax
lien?
can
it
be
asserted
only
against
his
life
estate
that
he
has
reserved?
or
is
the
burden
on
the
whole
fee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
let
me
change
the
hypothetical.
he
conveyed
it
to
one
of
his
children,
reserving
a
life
estate,
which
is
fairly
common
among...
a
very
common
transaction
among
people
with
small
estates.

chief
justice

will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
you
may
continue,
mr.
elliott.
chief
justice

you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
