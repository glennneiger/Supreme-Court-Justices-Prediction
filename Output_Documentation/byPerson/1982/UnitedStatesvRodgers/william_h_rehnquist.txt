you
say
that
the
government,
though,
doesn't
simply
stand
in
the
shoes
of
mr.
rodgers.
whose
shoes
does
it
stand
in?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
rights
has
congress
provided
other
than
the
rights
that
belonged
to
mr.
rodgers,
against
whom
the
lien--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
have
a
and
b,
tenants
in
common
under
state
law,
not
related
by
marriage
or
otherwise,
and
the
law
of
the
state
is
that
one
tenant
in
common
cannot
force
another
tenant
in
common
to
sell
the
property.
all
you
can
do
is
sell
your
interest.
and
the
government
has
a
tax
claim
against
a.
do
you
think
under
the
statute
that
you
are
claiming
under
that
the
government
can
force
both
tenants
in
common
to
sell
the
property,
to
sell
the
physical
property
rather
than
just
the
tenancy
in
common
interest
of
the
one
against
whom
it
has
a
tax
lien?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
is
almost
a
separate
inquiry
in
each
one
of
these
cases
whether
there
is
a
separate
market,
as
you
put
it?
do
you
find
that
in
the
statute
somewhere?
