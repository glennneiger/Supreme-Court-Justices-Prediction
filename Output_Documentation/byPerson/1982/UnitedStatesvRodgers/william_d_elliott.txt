mr.
william
d.
elliott
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
case,
the
government
takes
the
awesome
position
that
the
property
of
one
may
be
used
to
satisfy
the
tax
liability
of
another.
to
this
claim,
we
make
two
arguments.
first,
there
can
be
no
foreclosure
of
the
separate
homestead
property
because
in
texas
it
is
indivisible,
it
is
individual
to
her,
and
it
is
indefeasible
during
her
lifetime
or
until
her
earlier
voluntary
relinquishment.
secondly,
that
the
district
court's
judgment
not
ordering
foreclosure
in
the
rodgers
case
should
not
be
disturbed
here,
because
the
government
has
made
no
claim
of
abuse
of
discretion,
and
hasn't
even
attempted
to
overturn
that
finding
on
that
ground.
since
the
congress
defined
the
source
from
which
tax
liability
may
be
enforced,
that
is,
property
and
rights
to
property
of
the
taxpayer,
it
is
clear
here
that
the
government
is
simply
attempting
to
attack
and
utterly
destroy
the
property
of
someone
else.
it
is
imperative
that
we
examine
not
only
the
property
and
rights
to
property
of
the
taxpayer
here,
the
deceased
husband,
but
similarly
we
must
examine
those
property
interests
of
others
who
would
be
affected
or
who
own
individually
property
that
doesn't
belong
to
the
taxpayer.
in
texas,
it
has
been
a
venerable
policy
for
over
100
years,
texas
constitutional
law
since
1876,
and
statutory
law
for
many
years
before
that,
that
each
spouse
is
entitled
to
use
and
possess
the
homestead
for
as
long
as
they
want
to
or
until
their
death.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
yes,
it
is,
justice
white.
it
is
important
to
understand
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
texas
homestead
law.
in
fact,
homesteads
originated
in
texas.
each
spouse
can
own
a
community
one-half
interest
in
the
home,
or
one
spouse
may
own
it
all
as
separate
property.
but
each
spouse
is
given
a
separate
property
right,
a
homestead
right,
to
use
and
possess,
as
that
term
is
defined
in
the
texas
constitution,
for
their
entire
life.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
that
is
correct.
abandonment
of
the
homestead--
mr.
william
d.
elliott
--that
is
correct.
abandonment
of
the
homestead
does
not
occur
even
in
those
situations
where
there
is
a
rental.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
it
is
abandoned.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
yes.
it
is
a
voluntary
relinquishment.
whether
she
leaves
the
home
with
no
intention
to
return
or
sells
it,
it
is
a--
mr.
william
d.
elliott
--yes,
but
the
terms
of
the
property
settlement
agreement
have
a
bearing
on
it,
and
each
spouse...
for
example,
in
the
woods
case,
the
texas
supreme
court,
the
texas
supreme
court
there
held
that
each
spouse
has
an
indivisible,
individual,
both,
property
right
in
this
homestead,
and
in
that
case
the
husband
was
claiming
that
even
though
he
had
had
a
divorce,
and
even
though
his
children
had
left
the
home,
he
was
still
entitled
as
a
spouse
of
the
marriage
to
continue
in
that
homestead
for
as
long
as
he
lived,
and
the
texas
supreme
court
in
1929
said,
yes,
clearly,
this
property
right,
this
homestead
right
is
his.
in
this
case,
we
are
claiming
it
is
hers.
and
the
fact
that
her
husband
died,
or
if
he
had
gotten
a
divorce
from
her,
it
makes
no
difference.
it
is
her
property
right.
and
it
is
that
which
the
government
seeks
to
foreclose.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
right
of
possession,
justice
white.
in
all
those
cases
that
the
government
claims
are
inconsistent,
folsom,
trilling,
washington,
kosher,
they
all
involve
joint
tenancy
cases
where
the
taxpayer
has
a
right
of
possession.
here,
the
taxpayer
is
deceased.
his
heirs
cannot
compel
the
non-taxpayer
spouse
to
leave
the
property,
nor
do
they
have
any
right
to
possess
it
with
her.
what
they
have
is
simply
a
remainder
in
one-half.
that
will
become
possessory
upon
her
death
or
voluntary
relinquishment.
therefore,
it
is
unnecessary
for
this
court
to
consider
the
alleged
conflict
in
folsom
and
the
other
circuits.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
who
would
be
the
taxpayer,
your
honor?
mr.
william
d.
elliott
then
section
7403(c)
would
entitle
the
district
court
to
have
the
equitable
discretion
to
compel
foreclosure
or
not,
as
it
chooses
to
do
so.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
his
heirs
would.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
i
didn't
understand
you
to
say
right
of
survivorship,
your
honor.
i
understood
you
to
say
joint
tenancy.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
in
that
situation,
that
interest
expires
and
the
survivor
takes
the
property.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
that's
true.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
no,
but
the
underlying
property
that
supports--
mr.
william
d.
elliott
--that's
right,
your
honor,
and
we
would
also
have
the
same
result
in
a
tenancy
by
the
entirety.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
it
is
clear
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
taking
a
position
different
from
the
other
circuits,
but
we
are
not
relying
on
the
folsom
decision.
we
don't
believe
that
the
folsom
decision
was
central
to
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
be
included
within
that
category.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
as
i
understand
property
law
in
other
states
other
than
texas,
a
tenant
in
common
would
have
the
right
to
compel
partition
because
he
has
the
right
to
possess.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
but
with
the
right
of
survivorship,
i
am
not
sure
that
is
the
law,
your
honor.
i
understand
it
to
be
that
the
right
of
survivorship
does
not
compel
one
of
the
tenants--
mr.
william
d.
elliott
--we
don't
have
texas
law
that
is
as
active
in
the
survivorship
area
as
other
states,
so
i
am
speaking
without
a
great
familiarity
with
the
total
command
of
the
survivorship
rule,
but
i
understand
it
to
be
that
neither
spouse
can
sell
the
property
because
of
the
survivorship
feature
without
the
consent
of
the
other.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
if
it
is
jointly
agreed
to,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
with
right
of
survivorship,
i
understand
that
to
be
the
case.
it
is
certainly
the
case
in
texas
homestead
law
applicable
here.
texas
law
is
absolutely
clear
that
neither
spouse
can
partition,
sell,
or
affect
the
other
spouse's
interest
in
the
homestead
without
that
spouse's
consent,
and
here--
mr.
william
d.
elliott
--this
court
has
said,
aquilino,
and
durham
lumber
company,
and
busse,
authored
by
justice
brennan,
that
this
court
must
examine
the
rights
defined
by
the
states
that
the
taxpayer
has
in
the
property,
and
only
then
will
we
attach
consequences
federally
defined
to
those
state
interests.
here,
we
think
this
case
is
very
analogous
to
the
durham
lumber
company
decisions
and
the
aquilino
decisions.
there,
the
taxpayer
was
a
general
contractor
who
was
owed
money
allegedly
from
the
owner
of
the
building.
he
owed,
in
turn,
subcontractors
who
claimed
the
property
as
well.
this
court
held
in
both
instances,
in
durham
lumber
company
and
aquilino,
that
under
state
law,
having
examined
it,
that
the
relative
states,
new
york
and
north
carolina,
did
not
give
the
owner,
the
taxpayer...
i
mean,
the
general
contractor,
the
taxpayer,
any
property
or
rights
to
property
in
that
chosen
action
owed
from
the
owner.
in
fact,
under
state
law,
the
subcontractors
had
a
superior,
either
direct
right
of
action
against
the
owner
for
that
money
or
in
the
other
case,
the
general
contractor
held
it
in
trust.
in
both
case,
this
court
held
that
because
the
general
contractor
taxpayer,
the
irs
could
not
enforce
its
tax
lien
against
it.
only
after
the
subcontractors
claims
were
fulfilled
could
the
irs
collect
its
money
from
the,
in
essence,
excess
chosen
action.
that
is
analogous
to
the
situation
here.
we
have
another
related
party,
the
spouse.
her
interest
is
individual
to
her.
only
after
her
interest
expires
through
death
or
voluntary
relinquishment
may
the
government
enforce
its
lien.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
they
could,
your
honor.
they
have
not
sought
to
do
so.
well,
in
that
case
they
would
just
selling
the
lien.
they
would
be
selling
the
future
possessory
interest
in
one-half
of
the
community,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
oh,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
the
lien
attaches
to
his
interest
in
the
underlying
homestead,
which
is--
mr.
william
d.
elliott
--she
is
70
years
old,
and
it
will
be,
you
know,
her
life
expectancy
is
soon.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
or
abandons
it,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
she
could
swap
homestead,
to
answer
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
and
would
lose
the
protection
we
are
seeking
here.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
yes,
your
honor.
under
texas
law--
mr.
william
d.
elliott
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
that's
right,
because
her
second
homestead
would
not
have
arisen
prior
to
the
attachment
and
assessment
of
the
tax.
in
this
case,
she
acquired
the
homestead
in
1955,
certainly
long
before
the
tax
lien
arose.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
that
is
precisely
what
we
are
saying,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
i
think
they
just
lowered
it
to
16
percent,
your
honor.
it
was
21
percent
last
year.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
he
does,
but
it
is
subject
to
this
federal
tax
lien,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
yes,
sir.
in
this
case,
there
have
been
various
courts
of
appeals
that
have
considered
these
cases
involving
one
taxpayer
liable
but
a
homestead
affecting
two
states...
affecting
both
spouses.
there
is
a
consistent
patter,
we
think,
in
all
of
these
decisions.
there
are
not
the
folsom
line
of
cases.
these
are
those
other
cases,
such
as
herndon,
hershberger,
hefron,
weitzner;
in
all
those
cases
the
courts
of
appeals
have
exhibited
a
consistent
theme:
does
the
state
give
the
non-taxpayer
spouse
a
property
right,
as
we
have
in
texas,
as
hershberger
sought
in
kansas,
or
is
it
simply
an
exemption
form
creditors,
as
the
fifth
circuit
witnessed
in
weitzner?
we
suggest
that
that
is
the
proper
rule.
as
this
court
said
repeatedly,
as
we
pointed
out
earlier,
busse,
durham
lumber
company,
and
others,
it
is
a
proper
balance,
a
logical
and
sound
position
to
rely
on
the
state
law
and
what
is
that
law
insofar
ad
the
taxpayer
is
concerned,
and
then
attach
consequences
federally
defined.
all
of
those
decisions,
even
the
herndon
decision,
allowed
the
wife
to
live
on
the
property
for
the
remainder
of
her
life
if
the
wife
was
given
a
property
right.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
no.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
that's
correct,
because
the
underlying
property
interest,
justice
white,
expires.
it
does
no
longer
exist
after
the
death
of
the
first
spouse
to
die.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
section
7403
(c)
gives
the
district
court
the
power
compel
foreclose
in
those
cases
where
the
taxpayer
and
the
non-taxpayer
share
an
interest
in
the
property.
we
contend
that
section
7403
does
not
apply
because
there
is
no
joint
interest
here.
the
wife,
or
the
interest
of
the--
mr.
william
d.
elliott
--it
would
be
our
view
that
if
under
state
law
first
spouse
to
die's
interest
in
the
property
expired
and
extinguished
and
became
defeasible
on
his
death,
then
no,
because
his
property--
mr.
william
d.
elliott
--yes,
they
would
be
empowered
to
foreclose,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
yes,
but
the
interest
of
the
government
would
also
expire
on
the
death
of
the
taxpayer.
the
underlying
property
interest
to
which
the
lien
attached
is
all
that
the
government
gets,
and
it
gets
no
more
than
that.
and
for
the
government
to
be
able
to
take
a
possessory
interest
in
this
survivorship
property,
and
have
it
continue
beyond
the
life
of
the
joint
tenant,
means
that
the
government's
property
interest
is
stronger
than
that
of
the
underlying
fee
owner,
and
we
claim
that
that
is
not
what
the
government
is
entitled
to
do.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
the
scope
of
section
7403(c),
your
honor,
does
not
make
clear
to
me
that
the
government
would
take
any
more
than
what
life
estate
owner
had,
and
what
the
life
estate
owner
had
was
merely
possession
and
the
normal
right
and
duties
attributable
to
the
life
estate
tenant
during
his
lifetime,
and
since
the
ford
foundation
in
your
case
was
the
transferee
of
the
property
before
the
time
the
tax
lien
a
rose,
i
would
say
that
all
that
the
government
gets
in
that
case
is
what
the
life
estate
owner
had,
and
expires
at
this
death.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
identity
of
the
transferee
makes
any
difference,
except
in
those
instances
where
under
state
law
the
transferor
father
might
have
some
possibility
of
reversion
after
the
children
expired,
which
of
course
is
theoretically
possible.
in
the
ford
foundation
hypothetical,
i
assume
that
under
state
law,
he
has
nothing
more
than
what
the
normal
rights
and
duties
of
the
life
estate
tenant,
and
they
expire
at
his
death.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
no,
your
honor,
but
right
of
survivorship
in
texas
is
not
common.
it
is
not
something
that
we
experience
regularly.
it
is
more--
mr.
william
d.
elliott
--yes,
in
the
absence
of
a
right
of
survivorship,
i
think
it
is
important
to
distinguish
the
two.
justice
white,
i
understood,
was
asking
me
about
right
of
survivorship.
in
the
absence
of
the
right
of
survivorship,
clearly,
the
government
can
cash
out
the
other
joint
interest
owners,
but
in
the
instance
of
a
survivorship,
we
submit
no,
because--
mr.
william
d.
elliott
--i
call
it
a
tenancy
in
common.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
then
in
that
in
instance
i
would
say
that
the
government
does
not
get
any
more
than
the
taxpayer
had,
and
his
interest
expires
on
his
death,
and
absent
a
possibility
of
reversion.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
then
the
government
can
take
his
interest.
they
can
cash
out
the
non-taxpayer,
and
all
that
they
get
is
the
value
attributable
to
his
term.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
i
am
suggesting,
to
clarify,
justice
white,
that
his
underlying
property
interest
expires.
the
lien
does
not
expire,
but
the
lien
attaches
only
to
those
property
interests
that
the
taxpayer
has.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
in
that
particular
property,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
insofar
as
that
property
is
concerned,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
yes,
your
honor.
under
your
hypothetical,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
d.
elliott
that
is
correct.
