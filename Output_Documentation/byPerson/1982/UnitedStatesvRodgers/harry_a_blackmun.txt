justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
get
the
government's
position
straight.
i
don't
think
any
of
us
question
the
susceptibility
of
a
homestead
to
the
enforcement
of
a
federal
tax
lien,
but
is
it
the
government's
position
that
if
the
delinquent
taxpayer
owns
any
interest
in
a
homestead,
any
partial
interest,
that
it
may
proceed
to
sell
the
entire
homestead?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
here
you
would,
in
effect,
sell
the
homestead
under
mrs.
rodgers,
who
continued
to
occupy
it,
and
who
under
state
law
had
the
right
to
occupy
it
for
the
balance
of
her
lifetime.
you
would
in
effect
evict
her
and
give
her
her
share
of
the
proceeds?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
essentially?
isn't
it
correct?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
then,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
your
delinquent
taxpayer
is
a
person
who
holds
a
mortgage
on
my
property,
and
the
government
moves
in
to
enforce
the
lien,
the
tax
lien
on
the
mortgage.
does
that
mean
that
it
can
sell
my
property?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
is
an
interest
in
property.
it
is
an
interest
in
my
homestead
property,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
am
just
suggesting
that
i
think
the
ultimate...
your
argument
taken
to
the
ultimate
conclusion
means
that
they
can
sell
my
property
in
order
to
foreclose
the
lien
on
the
mortgagee's
property.
let
me
put
it
another
way.
suppose
that
my
next
door
neighbor
has
an
easement
over
my
homestead
property,
and
he
is
delinquent
in
taxes.
may
the
government
foreclose
on
his
easement
and
hence
sell
my
property?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
just
told
me
that
that
is
not
the
government's
position,
that
you
want
the
whole
bundle
of
was.
you
want
to
sell
the
whole
homestead,
and
give
her
her
share
of
the
proceeds.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
under
texas
law,
mr.
rodgers,
while
he
lived,
could
not
sell
that
homestead.
correct?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
consent.
why
should
the
government
in
asserting
its
lien
against
him
for
delinquent
taxes
have
any
greater
right
than
he
had?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
again
i
say,
the
government
wants
the
whole
hog.
it
wants
to
sell
the
property
out
from
under
mrs.
rodgers'
life
occupancy.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--what
is
your
definition
of
the
word
"property"?
the
husband's
interest
or
the
entire
fee?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
apart
from
state
law,
what
is
your
definition
of
the
word
"property"
in
the
federal
statute?
it
is
the
husband's
interest,
isn't
it?
it
has
to
be.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
brings
me
back
to
my
easement
hypothetical.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
if
it
can't?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
driven
right
back
to
justice
rehnquist's
inquiry.
but
you
can
never
keep
any
more
than
the
value
of
the
easement.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
speaking
of
the
folsom
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
speaking
of
the
folsom
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
the
folsom
case
isn't
before
us.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
may
well
be
wrong
if
it
had
come
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
except
you
have
different
facts.
you
have
homestead
interest
as
distinguished
from
a
tenancy
in
common,
as
i
understand
the
folsom
case
was.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
go
back
to
justice
white's
question,
because
i
didn't
understand
your
answer.
assume
a
joint
tenancy,
an
ordinary
joint
tenancy,
no
homestead
overlay,
and
one
of
the
joint
tenants
is
tax
delinquent.
may
the
government
under
texas
law,
is
there
any
provision
of
texas
law
that
prevents
the
government
from
moving
in
and
selling
the
delinquent
taxpayer's
interest
in
the
joint
tenancy?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
the
government
did
move
in,
isn't
the
joint
tenancy
thereupon
destroyed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
again
i
am
confused
by
your
terms.
do
you
have
such
a
thing
as
joint
tenancy
in
texas
without
right
of
survivorship?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course.
that
is
a
tenancy
in
common.
but
if
you
have
a
joint
tenancy,
you
have
a
right
of
survivorship.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
we
are
not
talking
about
his
death.
we
are
talking
about
moving
in
before
he
died.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
unless
it
has
foreclosed
during
his
lifetime.
