justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
interrupt
you?
to
put
this
on
a
little
broader
proposition...
i
guess
some
of
the
other
questions
the
same
way...
in
the
rodgers
brief
at
page
18,
they
rely
on
a
rather
broad
principle
that
the
collector
has
rights
no
greater
than
those
of
the
taxpayer
whose
rights
to
property
he
seeks
to
foreclose
on,
that
you
can't
go
beyond
the
shoes
of
the
taxpayer
in
fact,
and
you
didn't
respond
to
that
in
your
reply
brief.
i
just
wonder
if
other
than
this
case,
has
the
government
ever
asserted
a
greater
right
than
the
taxpayer
himself
could
have
asserted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
change
my
question
just
a
bit.
herndon
was
another
homestead
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
we
didn't
review.
and
the
question
here
is,
what
are
the
government's
rights
in
a
homestead
context.
and
i
am
asking
outside
of
the
homestead
context,
is
there
any
precedent
for
the
government
asserting
a
greater
right,
greater
property
right
than
that
of
the
taxpayer
against
whom
the
government
seeks
to
foreclose.
or
of...
and
take
that...
go
beyond
the
government
in
a
tax
situation.
any
lienholder
having
a
greater
right
than
the
property
right
of
the
lienee.
in
any
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
wanted
to
give
you
a
broader
range.
let's
leave
it
then
with
the
government.
any
time
the
government
has
done
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
suppose
the
taxpayer
had
the
fee
interest
in
a
piece
of
property,
and
he
gave
his
wife
or
someone
else
a
life
estate
in
the
property,
and
thereafter
the
lien
attached.
could
you
evict
the
life
tenant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
you
could
evict
the
life
tenant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
fee
owner
could
not
have
evicted
the
life
tenant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
imagine
you
had
a
little
difficulty
finding
any
cases
that
hold
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
has
both
a
life
estate
and
a
50
percent
interest
in
the
remainder,
whereas
in
my
case
she
didn't
even
have
the
50
percent
interest
in
the
remainder,
is
the
only
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
elliott--
--is
that
really
correct?
because
during
the
lifetime
of
the
joint
tenants,
is
it
not
true
that
the
taxpayer
would
have
had
the
right
to
sell
and
have
a
partition
of
the
proceedings
in
the
event
of
a
dispute
with
the
joint
owner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
true
of
joint
tenancy,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
before
the
death
of
the
taxpayer?
they
are
joint
tenants
and
own
property.
you
are
suggesting
that
neither
one
of
them
could
compel
the
sale
in
the
event
of
a
dispute
between
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
without
a
partition
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
to
be
jointly
agreed
to
in
a
joint
tenancy
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
elliott,
what
about
mr.
rodgers,
the
second
husband
here?
does
he
have
a
homestead
interest
in
the
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
subject
to
the
lien.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
