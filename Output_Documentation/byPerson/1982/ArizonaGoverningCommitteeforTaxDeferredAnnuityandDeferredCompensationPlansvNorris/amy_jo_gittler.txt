ms.
amy
jo
gittler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
city
of
los
angeles
department
of
water
and
power
versus
manhart,
this
court
held
that
an
employer's
use
of
gender-based
actuarial
tables
in
computing
payments
into
a
pension
plan
was
unlawful
under
title
7.
the
holding
in
that
case
is
not
challenged
today.
rather,
your
honors,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
employer
can
be
absolved
of
liability
under
title
7
because
it
contracts
out
with
a
third
party
to
provide
a
life
annuity
benefit
to
employees
or
because
there
are
alternative
non-discriminatory
options
available.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
unequivocally
no.
your
honors,
the
employer
in
this
case
is
not
so
dissimilar
from
the
employer
in
manhart.
manhart
did
present
a
self-insured
program,
and
this
program
does
include
third
party
insurance
companies.
but,
your
honors,
in
this
case
the
employer
created
the
plan.
the
employer
solicited
bids,
and
it
is
the
employer
that
withholds
money
month
to
month
from
the
employees'
paychecks.
significantly,
it
is
the
employer
that
has
chosen
the
insurance
companies
with
which
the
employee
can
participate
in
this
plan.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
it
is
my
understanding,
justice
blackmun,
that
it
does,
but
it
is
the
employer
that
withholds
the
money
from
the
paychecks.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
your
honor,
it
is
the
state
which
does
hold
title
to
the
moneys
until
they
are
dispersed
to
the
employee.
it
is
also
the
employer
that
contracts
directly
with
the
insurance
companies,
and
each
contract
on
its
face
contains
explicit
sex-based
actuarial
tables.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
the
physical
possession
of
the
money,
your
honor,
may
well
transfer
to
the
insurance
companies,
but
the
title
remains
with
the
state
of
arizona
until
it
is
dispersed
to
the--
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
the
significance
is
with
respect
to
the
employer's
involvement
in
this
plan,
and
that
the
legal
title
remains
with
the
employer.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
again,
your
honor,
that's
my
understanding.
that's
correct.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
certainly,
justice
o'connor,
that
is
what
the
employer
would
like
us
to
believe
today,
but
the
employer's
involvement
is
far
more
extensive
than
that.
the
employer
is
the
one
that
determines
where
the
money
will
in
fact
go,
and
although
the
employee
can
indicate
a
preference
as
to
how
the
money
should
be
invested,
it
is
the
employer
which
ultimately
has
the
discretion
to
accept
or
reject
that
preference.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
justice
o'connor,
it
is,
but
the
point
is,
it
is
one
of
the
many
indicia
of
the
control
that
the
employer
exercises
in
this
plan.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
your
honor,
the
issue
of
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case
is
really
a
bogus
issue,
because
in
this
case
we
are
dealing,
justice
o'connor,
with
an
explicit
sex-based
classification,
and
the
burden
of
proof
with
respect
to
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
unisex
tables
is
irrelevant
for
these
purposes,
because
once
we
have
shown
that
there
is
an
explicit
sex-based
classification,
that
is
all
that
we
need
to
show.
manhart
teaches
us--
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
our
burden
in
this
case
was
met
when
we
established
that
in
fact
there
was
an
explicit
sex-based
classification,
and
manhart
teaches
us
that
once
there
is
an
explicit
sex-based
classification
based
upon
actuarial
tables,
as
in
this
case,
that
the
employer
is
liable
under
title
7,
and
none
of
the
bases
upon
which
the
employer
now
seeks
to
absolve
itself
of
liability
are
sufficient
to
allow
it
to
remove
the
mandate
and
the
prohibitions
established
by
congress
under
title
7.
the
nexus
between
the
employer
and
the
employee
is
here.
it
is
the
employer
which
has
created
the
plan,
and
it
is
the
employer
that
has
provided
the
employee
with
the
fringe
benefit,
and
once
the
employer
undertakes
to
provide
an
employee
with
a
fringe
benefit,
title
7
states
that
it
must
provide
it
in
a
non-discriminatory
fashion.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
no,
chief
justice
burger.
this
is
a
voluntary
plan.
but
that
factor
does
not
in
any
way
mitigate
against
the
employer's
liability.
title
7
does
not
draw
lines
between
voluntary
and
involuntary,
and
numerous
facets
of
the
employment
setting
are
voluntary,
but
that
fact
alone
does
not
in
any
way
bear
upon
an
employer's
liability
or
obligation
to
provide
non-discriminatory
benefits.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
it
was
explicit
gender-based
classification
between
men
and
women,
and
the
parties--
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
--you
can
read
it,
your
honor,
in
the
very
contracts
that
have
been
signed.
the
parties
have
stipulated
in
the
joint
appendix
that
the
payments
that
women
receive
and
men
receive
are
based
upon
sex-based
actuarial
tables.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
it
is
as
a
result
of
the
contracts
that
the
state
has
entered
into
with
the
insurance
companies
that
creates
this
discrimination,
but
the
mere
fact
that
they
have
contracted
with
these
insurance
companies
is
not
sufficient
to
eliminate
the
liability.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
your
honor,
as
we
establish
or
argue
in
our
brief,
exhibit
h
to
the
first
set
of
interrogatories
in
fact
suggests
that
there
was
an
actual
overt
solicitation
for
bids
broken
down
by
men
and
women,
and
even
so,
regardless
of
whether
there
was
an
overt
solicitation,
the
employer
was
not
compelled
to
provide
this
kind
of
discrimination.
there
is
some
argument
of
compulsion
in
this
case,
but,
your
honors,
the
employer
had
in
option
in
this
case.
it
could
decide
not
to
provide
the
non-discriminatory
option,
or
it
could
self-insure,
and
either
of
those
options
were
viable
options.
it
was
not
obligated
to
provide
this
discriminatory
option
which
on
its
face
discriminates
month
to
month
against
women.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
as
this
court
held
in
manhart,
which
was
a
self-insured,
program,
that
the
employer
was
precluded
from
basing
the
benefits
or,
in
manhart,
the
contributions,
in
this
case
the
benefits
on
the
basis
of
sex-segregrated
actuarial
tables.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
that
is
not
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
because
under
this
particular
plan
in
particular,
it
is
an
attractive
plan
to
employees
because
of
the
significant
tax
benefits.
employees--
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
--justice
rehnquist,
we
think
that
is
not
an
accurate
assumption
to
make
in
reviewing
this
case.
because
of
the
substantial
tax
benefits
an
employee
who
opted,
a
male
employee,
for
instance,
who
opted
to
choose
the
money,
to
obtain
the
money
from
his
paycheck
and
have
it...
receive
it
rather
than
investing
it
would
pay
the
tax
consequence
at
the
time
it
is
received,
and
that
would
eliminate
the
significance
of
this
kind
of
a
benefit
program.
in
addition,
as
the
actuaries
who
have
filed
a
brief
in
support
of
our
position
indicate,
rarely
are
decisions
such
as
this
made
upon
expectancies
of...
men's
or
women's
expectancies,
life
expectancies.
the
issues
or
considerations
that
are
taken
into
account
by
people
when
they
opt
into
these
kinds
of
plans
are
the
tax
benefits
and
the
investment
made
to
return,
and
the
tax
benefits
in
this
case
are
outstanding.
in
addition,
justice
rehnquist,
if
an
employee
chose
to
go
out
into
the
open
market,
a
male
employee,
for
instance,
not
only
would
he
have
the
money
that
has
already
been
taxed,
but
he
would
also
have
to
then
obtain
an
individual
policy,
and
would
not
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
group
policy
that
is
in
existence
under
this
particular
plan.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
your
honor--
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
--chief
justice
burger,
if
it
was
done
in
the
context
of
an
employer
providing
the
fringe
benefit,
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
today,
an
insurance
company
in
the
abstract
out
in
the
market
is
not
susceptible
to
title
7
in
this
context
but
if
an
employer
undertakes
to
provide
life
insurance,
for
example,
to
an
employee,
then
again
manhart
teaches
us
that
the
amounts
that
are
paid
in
or
the
amounts
that
are
paid
out
could
not
be
based
upon
aggregates,
cannot
be
based
upon
sex-segregated
actuarial
tables.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
that
that's
an
issue
that
either
party
needs
to
necessarily
prove
one
way
or
the
other,
because
once
they
have
undertaken
to
provide
a
sex-discriminatory
plan,
whether
or
not
there
might
be
some
adverse
consequences
of
this
court
holds
that
title
7
applies
is
not
really
relevant
to
the
issue
of
liability
under
title
7.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
your
honor,
there
are
always
going
to
be
consequences
of
this
court's
decisions,
and
if
in
fact...
for
instance,
mr.
endicott
suggested
that
the
consequence
if
this
court
were
to
uphold
the
ninth
circuit,
he
has
suggested
that
the
effect
would
be
to
completely
eliminate
the
plan.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
that
is
always
a
risk
that
is
taken,
your
honor.
an
employer
can
evade
responsibility
and
avoid
liability
under
title
7
by
having
no
employees.
but
that
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
this
court
to
find
that
there
is
no
liability
or
that
section
703(a)
does
not
apply
to
this
employer
and
prohibit
the
particular
practice
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
now,
there
is
also
some
discussion,
your
honors,
about
the
options,
and
as
justice
blackmun
pointed
out,
the
lump
sum
option
does
come
with
significant
tax
consequences.
for
nathalie
norris
and
millions
of
other
employees
and
retirees
throughout
the
country,
the
only
feasible
option
under
this
plan
is
the
annuity
option.
in
addition,
the
sum
certain
for
a
definite
period
of
time,
the
alternative
option,
does
not
give
ms.
norris
nor
anyone
else
the
kind
of
protection
that
they
want
for
their
entire
retirement
life.
even
more
significantly,
your
honors,
there
is
no
legal
precedent
or
basis
for
absolving
an
employer
under
title
7
because
there
are
non-discriminatory
options
available.
and
in
fact--
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
the
court
in
manhart
specifically
addressed
that
issue
in
a
footnote
in
which
the
court
observed
that
not
every
disparate
impact
creates
a
violation
of
title
7,
and
indeed...
the
issue
was
raised
with
respect
to
the
potential
unfairness,
and
incorporated
into
that
in
manhart
was
the
issue
of
the
potential
illegality,
but
manhart
teaches
us
that
not
every
disparate
impact
is
going
to
create...
under
the
griggs
analysis
is
going
to
create
a
violation
of
title
7.
unfairness
was
one
of
the
arguments
that
was
raised
over
and
over
again
in
manhart
and
was
explicitly
rejected,
not
only
on
policy
but
also
on
the
legal
bases.
in
addition,
this
court
has
held,
last
term,
under
connecticut
versus
teal,
that
an
employer
is
not
justified
in
discriminating
in
one
aspect
solely
because
it
does
not
discriminate
in
another
aspect,
and
this
argument
made
by
the
employer
today
sounds
very
similar
to
the
argument
that
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
connecticut
versus
teal.
in
addition,
in
mississippi
versus
hogan,
this
court
held
that
an
explicit
sex-based
classification
under...
could
not
be
justified
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
solely
because
there
happened
to
be
other
non-discriminatory
options
available.
thus,
your
honors,
not
only
is
there
a
question
of
policy
in
terms
of
the
feasibility
of
the
alternative
options
that
are
available,
but
there
is
simply
no
legal
basis
for
absolving
this
employer
of
liability
solely
because
there
are
alternative
non-discriminatory
options
available.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
justice
o'connor,
although
mr.
endicott
has
characterized
the
relief
that
was
ordered
in
this
case
as
retroactive,
there
was
nothing
retroactive
about
the
relief
that
was
ordered
in
this
case.
in
fact,
your
honor,
we
specifically
requested
reimbursements
for
the
disparate
amounts
that
had
been
pad
to
men...
to
women
less
than
men,
and
the
court
rejected
that
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
we
then
moved
to
amend
the
judgment,
and
it
was
again
denied
by
the
court.
so,
we
have
purely
prospective
relief,
and
that
is--
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
--yes,
your
honor,
we
have
not
appealed
the
decision
of
the
court,
the
denial
of
the
retroactive
benefits.
we
are
satisfied
with
the
equalization
of
the
benefits
prospectively,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
has
ordered.
mr.
endicott
has--
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
--justice
blackmun,
women
as
a
class,
in
the
aggregate,
may
get
more,
but
individual
women,
individuals
will
not
get
any
more
than
a
similarly
situated
man.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
if
nathalie
norris
were
to
retire
at
age
65,
and
had
the
$53,000
of
her
money
accumulated,
and
a
similarly
situated
man
retired
with
the
same
$53,000,
and
both
of
them
lived
to
be
85
years
old,
month
to
month
ms.
norris
would
receive
$33.95
less
per
month
than
the
similarly
situated
man,
and
upon
their
death
nathalie
norris
will
have
received
$8,000
less
than
the
similarly
situated
man.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
chief
justice
burger,
manhart
teaches
us,
and
the
holding
in
teal
teaches
us
that
it
cannot
be
based
on
group
statistics,
that
we
must
under
703(a)
look
to
the
individuals,
and
title
7
requires
us
to
treat
individuals
as
individuals
and
not
as
group
statistics,
and
that
is
the
significant
holding
that
we
can
derive
from
manhart,
and
it
is
equally
applicable
in
this
case.
mr.
endicott
has
essentially--
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
--justice
blackmun,
you
suggested
earlier
that
the
result
may
be
that
the
option
is
suspended,
and--
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
--your
honor,
we
want
the
state
to
comply
with
title
7.
we
want
the
employer
in
this
case
to
provide
the
same
benefits
to
women
as
it
does
to
men.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
your
honor,
an
employer
can
always
absolve
itself
of
liability
by
not
having
employees,
by
not
having
an
employment
setting.
that
may
be
the
effect.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
no,
your
honor,
he
is
not,
and
at
that
point
he
has
no
obligations
in--
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
--chief
justice
burger,
the
point
is
that
congress
has
spoken,
and
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
statute,
and
i
think
that
is
important
to
emphasize,
the
statutory
prohibitions,
and
the
statute
prohibits
treating
individuals
as
members
of
a
class,
and
that's
what
this
court
has
held
in
interpreting
title
7.
now,
in
terms
of
the
remedy
which
was
raised
by
justice
o'connor,
mr.
endicott
has
also...
has
essentially
conceded
that
in
this
particular
case
there
is
really
a
minimal
amount
that
is
involved,
and
there
is
really...
there
are
only
four
employees
that
have
retired
under
the
stipulated
facts.
as
mr.
endicott
stated,
the
amount
that
may
be
involved
is
de
minimis,
and
in
fact,
your
honors,
the
state
in
this
case
never
obtained
a
stay
of
the
order
of
the
district
court,
and
so
clearly
experience
must
indicate
that
in
fact
the
state
has
been
able
to
comply
with
the
order.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not
in
any
way
suggesting
that
this
is
an
unimportant
case.
what
we
are
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
this
court
must
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
in
this
case
there
are
four
women
who
have
retired.
ms.
amy
jo

yes,
justice
stevens,
it
does
affect
a
number
of
employers,
and
mr.
endicott
would
argue
here
today
for
all
of
those
employers
that
are
out
there,
and
that
is
something
that
we
cannot
do.
we
can
point
out,
your
honor--
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
we
cannot
address
the
possible...
all
the
possible
issues
that
might
be
raised
by
other
employers.
we
must
deal
with
the
record
that
was
involved
in
this
case,
and
we
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
a
lot
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
raised
by
other
employers,
there
is
tremendous
dispute
with
respect
to
the
amounts
that
it
might
take
in
order
to
come
into
compliance
with
this
order,
and
the
actuaries
that
have
filed
a
brief--
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
--justice
white,
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
that
it
has,
except
for
the
fact
that
it
has
avowed
to
this
court
that
it
has
suspended
that
third
option.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
your
honor,
i
have
no...
no,
the...
if
the
employer
does
not
provide
the
non-discriminatory
option,
there
may,
your
honor,
be
other
issues
with
respect
to
contract
or
other
problems
with
respect
to
the
suspension
of
the
option,
but
if
an
employer
responds
by
not
providing
this
particular
fringe
benefit,
that
in
itself
is
not
a
violation
except
as
it
may
bear
on
employees
who
are
already
participating
in
the
plan
or
who
have
already
retired.
chief
justice
burger,
you
asked
with
respect
to
live
insurance
under
this
plan.
there
is
no
life
insurance
under
this
plan,
and
there
is
no
provision
under
this
plan
which
charges
women
less
because
they
are
women
in
the
payment
of
life
insurance.
now,
the
life
insurance
may
be
part
of
another
plan,
but
i
know
of
no
particular
provision
under
this
which
allows
for
charging
women
less
because
they
are
women.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
your
honor,
again,
that
would
be
discrimination,
but
i
was
responding
more
to
mr.
endicott's
suggestion
that
there
was
a
life
insurance
program
under
this
particular
plan
which
charged
women
less,
and
i
know
of
no
such
separate
provision
unless
it
is
included
in
one
of
the
other
options.
ms.
amy
jo
gittler
absolutely
not,
justice
stevens.
that
would
in
no
way
affect
the
outcome
in
this
case
or
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
title
7.
in
addition,
there
is
an
argument
that
is
made
by
the
petitioners
of
the
actuarial
equivalents,
and
that
in
fact
women
are
receiving
the
same
in
the
aggregate
as
men
in
the
aggregate,
and
your
honors,
that
is
the
very
heart
of
the
argument
that
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
manhart,
and
cannot
be
relitigated
before
this
court
again.
nathalie
norris
will
receive
less
month
to
month
than
a
similarly
situated
man,
and
that
is
what
manhart
proscribes.
in
addition,
there
was
a
suggestion
made
by
mr.
endicott
that
this
merely
reflects
the
open
market,
and
that
this
somehow
falls
within
the
term
open
market
that
this
court
referred
to
in
manhart,
but
there,
this
court
held
that
an
employer
can
give
an
employee
a
lump
sum
amount
and
go
out
and
buy
whatever
he
or
she
can
on
the
open
market.
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case
involves
an
employer
who
has
itself
provided
the
benefits
to
the
employees,
and
has
not
suggested
that
the
employer...
that
the
employee
go
out
into
the
open
market
simply
with
a
dollar
amount
in
its
hand.
the
issue,
your
honors,
in
this
case
is
one
of
statutory
construction.
congress
has
determined
the
scope,
the
applicability
of
title
7,
and
its
prohibitions,
and
in
this
case
the
employer
has
violated
title
7
by
providing
a
discriminatory
fringe
benefit
to
its
employees.
neither
the
involvement
of
the
insurance
companies
or
the
presence
of
the
options
in
this
case
are
sufficient
to
overcome
the
statutory
prohibition
of
title
7.
for
those
reasons,
your
honor,
we
respectfully
request
that
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
decision
be
upheld.
