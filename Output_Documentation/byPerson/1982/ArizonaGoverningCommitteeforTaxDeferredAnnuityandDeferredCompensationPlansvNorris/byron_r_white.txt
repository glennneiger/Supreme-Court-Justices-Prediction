putting
aside
the
retroactive
relief
for
the
moment,
do
you
know
if
unisex
insurance
is
available?
could
they
buy
insurance,
a
different
kind
of
a
policy,
a
different
kind
of
an
annuity?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
such
annuities
available
on
the
market?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
that
the
insurance
companies
had
such
an
annuity
available,
and
the
employer
didn't
buy
that
one,
he
bought
the
one
that's
in
option
3.
what
about
the
employer
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
explicit
sex
classification
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
was
that
evidenced?
can
you
read
that
anywhere
in
the
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
employer
didn't
mandate
that.
nowhere
in
the
state's
plan,
deferred
compensation
plan,
can
you
read
anything
like
that.
so
it
isn't
explicit.
it
is
the
result
of
the
insurance
industry
selling
sex-based
or
gender-based
annuities.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
employer
didn't
ask
insurance
companies
to
bid
based
on
gender-based
annuity.
they
didn't
put
out
a
specification,
please
bid
on
the
basis
of
distinguishing
between
men
and
women.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
part
of
the
record
that
arizona
has
terminated
option
3?
or
is
it...
there
is
no
dispute
that
that
has
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
matter
of
public
notice,
is
it,
or
are
we
permitted
to
take
notice
of
that,
that
arizona
is
complying
in
this
manner?
you
don't
say
that
it's
not
in
compliance
with
title
7
now,
do
you?
