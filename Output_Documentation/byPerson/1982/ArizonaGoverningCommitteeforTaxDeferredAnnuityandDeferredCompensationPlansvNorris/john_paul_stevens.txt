justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
in
this
plan
there
is
no
medical
examination
at
all,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
there
really
wouldn't
be,
because
poor
health
is
a
benefit
to
the
insurance
company.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
i
suppose
in
selecting,
doing
their
calculation,
the
insurance
company
could
take
into
account
the
fact
that
there
is
this
self-selection
element
in
the
group.
the
individuals
who
tend
to
eliminate
those
who
are
identifiably
a
short-term
risk.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
anything
about
whether
the
projections
for
different
kinds
of
industries
or
professions
are
somewhat
different?
in
other
words,
you
might
have
a
different
projection
for
a
group
of
lawyers
than
you
would
have
for
a
group
of
workers
in
a
different
occupation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
a
pretty
wide
group.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
that
has
to
be
a
permanent
solution?
i
suppose
it
is
at
least
theoretically
possible...
maybe
you
won't
do
it...
that
you
could
in
the
future
adopt
a
unisex
program.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
gittler,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
burden
of
proof?
your
opponent
suggests
that
if
we
talk
in
terms
of
a
unisex
table,
that
there
would
be
a
natural
selection
that
would
drive
the
market
to
select
the
female
rate.
you
have
responded,
as
i
understand
you,
by
saying,
well,
even
a
female
rate
might
be
better
for
the
male
because
of
the
tax
consequences
of
the
lump
sum
payment
plus
the
group
purchasing
power.
now,
we
don't
really
know
whether
that
is
true
or
not.
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
question?
do
you
understand
what
i
am
asking
you?
as
to
whether
or
not
you
are
correct
in
saying
in
substance
the
unisex
plan
would
be
more
favorable
to
both
men
and
women,
whereas
he
is
saying,
no,
no,
we
can
just
think
it
through
and
it
would
inevitably
be
a
female,
an
all-female
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
are
saying
that
if
there
is
a
violation
of
law,
even
if
establishing
the
violation
hurts
women
generally,
that
is
just
an
unfortunate
consequence
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
are
not
suggesting
this
is
an
unimportant
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
it
affects
a
large
number
of
plans
and
a
large
number
of
people,
does
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
not
arguing
for
all
the
women
employees
who
are
out
there?
it
seems
to
me
you
are,
and
i
think
you
properly
are
doing
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
illegality
would
be
cured
if
they
added
a
fourth
option
which
was
a
life
insurance
policy
that
gave
precisely
the
same
economic
benefit
to
women
as
a
class
as
this
one
gives
to
men
as
a
class?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
endicott,
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
it
is
the
burden
of
proof
question
i
asked
your
opponent.
in
response
to
your
suggestion
that
only
the
female
rate
would
be
available
if
you
tried
to
have
a
unisex
table,
she
responded
in
two
ways,
as
i
understood
her,
saying,
one,
the
group
policy
may
get
a
better
rate
than
an
individual,
and
secondly,
that
because
of
the
tax
benefit
that
you
just
described,
the
individual
couldn't
buy
as
favorable
a
policy
even
as
the
female
rate
would
produce.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
answer
that
question?
and
if
not,
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
point?
which
one
of
you
should
we
accept?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
congress
addressed
this
problem
at
all
since
the
manhart
decision?
