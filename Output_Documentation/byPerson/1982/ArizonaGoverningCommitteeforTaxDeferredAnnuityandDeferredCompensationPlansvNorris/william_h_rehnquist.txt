justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
gittler,
in
your
answer
to
justice
blackmun's
question,
i
would
infer
that
the
employer
is
kind
of
a
self-insurer.
you
say
that
the
employer
hangs
onto
the
money
until
it
is
ultimately
paid
out
to
the
employees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
wasn't
aware
that
one
ordinarily
separated
the
concept
of
the
title
to
money
and
the
physical
possession
of
money.
is
there
some
significance
in
this
case
between
those
two?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
legal
title
to
the
money,
which
is...
the
possession
of
which
passes
to
the
insurance
company?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
gittler,
what
if
the
employer
had
self-insured
in
this
case.
is
your
idea
that
in
that
context,
the
employer
could
have
made
no
allowance
for
the
difference
in
longevity
between
men
and
women?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
the
result,
if
the
employer
had
done
that,
be
very
much
as
mr.
endicott
predicted
in
the
unisex
policies,
that
there
would
be
no
men
applicants
for
this
particular
self-insurance
policy
that
you
are
mentioning,
and
that
the
only
applicants
would
be
women,
and
they
would
end
up
paying
the
female
rate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
presumably
an
employee
who
has
an
option
of
joining
the
employer's
unisex
plan,
which
you
say
he
must
have,
or
taking
the
money
that
it
would
cost
to
pay
premiums
in
that
and
go
to
an
insurance
company
which
does
rate
on
the
basis
of
gender,
the
men
are
going
to
go
to
an
insurance
company
that
rates
on
the
basis
of
gender.
so
you
are
not
going
to
have
any
employee
applicants
who
are
male,
i
would
think.
