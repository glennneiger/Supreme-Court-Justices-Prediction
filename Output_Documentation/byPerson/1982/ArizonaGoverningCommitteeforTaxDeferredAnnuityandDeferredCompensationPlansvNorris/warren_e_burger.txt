chief
justice

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
arizona
governing
committee
for
tax
deferred
annuity
and
deferred
compensation
plans
against
nathalie
norris.
mr.
endicott,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
mr.
endicott,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
that,
of
course--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--there
is
no
life
insurance
as
such
in
this
case,
separate
and
apart
from
the
program?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
do
the
life
insurance
companies
charge
less
premiums
for
insuring
women
of
the
same
age
as
men?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
the
reason
for
that
is
that
is
a
corollary
of
the
annuity
proposition,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
the
women
who
are
going
to
live
longer
and
pay
premiums
longer,
on
an
average.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
do
the
mortality
tables
that
are
used
by
the
insurers
make
any
division
except
as
between
men
and
women?
are
there
any
other
categories?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
men
and
women--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--age,
obviously.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
a
mortality--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--they
don't
include
whether
they
are
foreign-born
or
any
other
factors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
insurance
companies
can
take
care
of
that
by
not
insuring
heavy
drinkers
and
heavy
smokers,
can
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
and
they
try
to
identify
them,
don't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
their
examinations.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
have
these
statistics
been
kept,
mr.
endicott?
how
far
back
does
the
mortality
table
go?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
more
than
100
years
since
they
began
it,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
ms.
gittler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
they
compelled
to
participate?
are
the
employees
compelled
to
participate
in
this
plan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
unlawful
for
an
insurance
company
to
charge
lower
rates
for
women
for
life
insurance
than
for
men?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
be
illegal
discrimination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
assumption
is
contrary
to
the
experience
of
the
american
experience
table
of
mortality.
you
are
assuming
that
they
would...
they
are
the
same
age,
and
they
go
in
at
the
same
time,
and
die
at
the
same
time.
that
may
be
true
about
the
specific
individuals,
but
can
a
pension
plan,
an
organized
situation
like
this
be
based
on
what
happens
in
a
particular
individual
case,
or
must
it
be
based
on
the
law
of
averages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
talking
about
something
that
is
utterly
unrealistic,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
my
hypothetical
question
was,
if
you
had
a
plan
which
charged
women
less
for
life
insurance,
and
the
state
might
well
include
life
insurance
in
its
program,
then
would
that
be
discrimination
against
the
men?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
endicott,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
