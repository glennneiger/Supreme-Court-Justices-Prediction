mr.
endicott,
there
is
some
indication
that
arizona
at
least
solicited
bids
on
the
basis
of
the
sex-based
tables--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
it
assumed
that
is
what
it
wanted
and
went
out
to
get
what
in
fact
it
got.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
any
event,
arizona
didn't
ask
for
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
it
be
allowable
under
title
7,
though,
i
think,
is
the
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it
were
an
insurance
company,
as
we
have
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
the
basis
of
race.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
you
another
question
or
two
while
you
are
interrupted?
the
record
shows,
i
believe,
that
by
august
of
'78,
four
women
had
retired
on
a
lifetime
annuity
under
the
arizona
plan.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
any
other
women
in
the
plaintiff
class
retired
and
selected
that
annuity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
now
terminated,
and
so
we
are
dealing
with
four
women.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the
plan
were
reinstituted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the
court
were
to
affirm
the
court
below,
and
you
had
to
discuss
prospective
remedies,
what
would
your
position
be
on
the
remedy
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
seems
like
a
strange
basis
to
hang
your
argument
on.
i
understood
that
the
money
is
money
otherwise
due
the
employee,
that
the
employee
directs
the
employer
state
to
pay
over
to
the
insurance
company,
in
effect,
for
the
premiums,
and
the
state
is
simply
a
pass-through
for
convenience.
isn't
that
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
title
to
the
money.
i
mean,
that
is
a
different
sort
of
an
argument,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
who
has
the
burden
of
proof,
as
justice
blackmun
asked
earlier,
that
unisex
tables
were
in
fact
available?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
do
concede
that
you
have
the
burden,
the
respondents
as
plaintiffs
had
the
burden
of
proof
initially,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
irony
of
affirming
if
a
state
is
to
continue,
though,
to
provide
an
annuity
plan
after
an
affirmance
is
that
in
order
to
avoid
disparate
treatment
of
women
by
mandating
unisex
tables,
it
will
have
a
disparate
impact
on
men
to
achieve
it.
do
you
want
to
comment
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
your
position
is
the
correct
one,
what
should
inform
the
court's
selection
of
remedies,
ms.
gittler?
can
it
be
prospective
only,
or
what
should
inform
the
court's
decision
on
remedial
action?
