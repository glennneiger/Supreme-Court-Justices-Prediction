yes,
probably
so.
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
on
whether
unisex
tables
are
available
or
were
available.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it
your
opposition
disagrees
with
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
problem
there
is
the
tax
result.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
your
position
is
that
if
you
do
not
prevail
in
this
lawsuit,
that
in
effect
the
plaintiffs
have
driven
out
of
the
picture
the
third
option.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
sometimes
we
overlitigate,
don't
we?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
endicott,
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
the
insurance
companies
used
tables
based
on
race
rather
than
sex?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
there
are
diseases
that
are
suffered
more
by
persons
of
one
race
than
another.
the
classic
example
is
sickle
cell
anemia,
of
course.
comfetis
is
another.
and
i
suppose
there
would
be
just
as
much
justification
for
an
insurance
company
to
set
up
tables
on
the
basis
of
race
because
of
the
presence
of
those
special
risks.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
in
the
group
policy
context,
all
this
is
less
significant.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
the...
or
the
specific
term
annuity,
if
i
may
call
it
that.
i
am
always
concerned
about
this
lump
sum,
because
you
run
immediately
into
everything
being
taxed
in
one
year.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
certainly
if
someone
at
retirement
knows
he
has
terminal
cancer,
he
isn't
going
to
take
a
life
annuity.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
you
about
the
employer
withholding
money.
doesn't
the
money
go
to
the
insurance
company?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
employer,
as
i
think
your
statement
inferred,
is
not
sitting
there
with
the
money
in
his
hot
little
hand
and
making
money
off
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
satisfied
with
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
yet
women
in
the
long
run
will
get
more.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
are
driving
the
option
away,
aren't
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
what
you
really
want?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
it
drives
the
option
away?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
state
of
arizona
needs
employees,
and
that
is
not
a
very
good
illustration.
yes,
you
have
said
that
several
times.
is
an
employer
an
employer
after
he
gets
rid
of
his
employees?
