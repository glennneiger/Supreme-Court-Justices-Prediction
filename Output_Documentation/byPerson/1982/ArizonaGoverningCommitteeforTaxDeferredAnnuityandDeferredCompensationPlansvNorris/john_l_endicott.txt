mr.
john
l.
endicott
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
some
of
the
questions
that
we
believe
were
left
unresolved
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
manhart
case.
in
manhart,
this
court
was
concerned
with
a
mandatory
employer-operated
pension
fund
which
required
the
women
make
larger
contributions
than
men.
the
result
was
that
a
woman's
take-home
pay
was
smaller
than
a
man's.
this
court
held
that
such
a
plan
violated
title
7,
and
we
make
no
contention
today
that
such
holding
was
erroneous.
but
the
arizona
deferred
compensation
plan
is
different
in
a
number
of
respects.
in
the
arizona
an,
independent
insurance
companies
issue
the
life
annuities
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
they,
not
arizona,
are
the
ones
who
determine
the
appropriate
monthly
payment
to
be
made
based
on
the
amount
accumulated
by
the
employee
and
the
age
and
the
sex
of
that
employee.
it
is
the
insurance
companies
which
developed
and
use
the
sex-based
actuarial
tables
which
are
in
issue
here.
arizona
did
not
create
or
control
or
use
such
tables,
but
nevertheless
has
been
held
responsible
for
their
use.
arizona's
only
intent
was
to
make
available
to
its
employees
participating
in
its
deferred
compensation
plan
the
widest
possible
selection
of
payout
methods,
including
life
annuities.
arizona
did
not
treat
or
intend
to
treat
its
female
employees
less
favorably
than
its
male
employees.
the
arizona
plan--
mr.
john
l.
endicott
--yes,
justice--
mr.
john
l.
endicott
--justice
o'connor,
it
solicited
bids,
and
in
the
solicitation
it
asked
for
quotes
on
males
and
females,
but
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
anybody
from
giving
the
same
quote
if
there
had
been
a
unisex
table
available
and
if
the
bidder
had
chosen
to
do
it.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
no,
your
honor,
but
as
your
honor
may
have
observed
from
the
various
amici
briefs
filed,
nobody
was
offering.
it
didn't
ask
for
it
because
it
didn't
want
it
or
didn't
intend
it.
it
never
thought
of
it,
i
think,
is
the
answer.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
the
burden
of
proof
on
what...
on
precisely
what,
justice
blackmun?
mr.
john
l.
endicott
it
is
our
position
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
upon
the
respondent,
that
it
would
have
been
upon
the
plaintiffs
in
the
lawsuit
to
prove,
because
if
the
contention
is
that
arizona
discriminated
by
not
seeking
the
use
of
unisex
annuity
tables,
the
question
would
be
arizona
discriminated
because
it
didn't
ask
for
or
take
unisex
annuity
tables,
i
think,
just
as
in
the
other
title
7
cases
where
an
employee
who
contends
he
or
she
was
discriminated
against
by
not
being
given
a
job,
you
must
show
that
the
job
was
available.
therefore,
i
think
the
burden,
your
honor,
is
on
the...
on
the
plaintiff
to
prove
that
it
was
available
and
arizona
deliberately
did
not
take
it.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
i
believe
so.
the
arizona
plan,
again
unlike
manhart,
is
a
voluntary
plan.
no
one
has
to
join.
no
one
has
to
contribute.
the
employee
under
the
arizona
plan
can
take
home
his
or
her
entire
wage
or
compensation
if
he
or
she
so
elects.
in
fact,
the
employee
can
do
what
he
or
she
chooses
with
his
or
her
money,
and
it
is
our
position
that
permitting
someone
to
do
something
is
not
discriminating
against
someone.
in
the
arizona
plan,
again,
unlike
manhart,
the
contributions
are
equal,
equal
in
the
sense
that
the
employee
is
free
to
make
whatever
contribution
he
or
she
chooses.
there
are
minimum
and
maximum
limits,
but
any
male
employee
can
contribute
the
same
amount
as
any
female
employee.
again,
therefore,
there
is
no
difference
in
the
take-home
pay
that
a
male
or
a
female
employe
receives.
in
the
arizona
plan,
another
distinction
is,
there
is
no
contribution
by
the
employer.
the
plan
is
funded
entirely
by
contributions
by
the
employee,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
the
statute
which
created
the
plan,
the
employer,
the
state,
cannot
make
a
contribution.
the...
only
the
employee
funds
are
involved,
and
similarly
situated
employees
receive
the
same
compensation.
now,
there
is
a
difference
between
the
arizona
deferred
compensation
plan
and
the
arizona
retirement
plan.
that
plan
is
funded
by
employer
contributions,
and
in
that
plan,
where
the
plan
is
underwritten
by
the
employer,
the
payments
are
the
same
for
male
and
female
employees.
another
distinction
from
manhart
under
the
arizona
plan
is
that
the
arizona
plan
offers
various
options
to
the
employees.
they
have
choices
available
to
them
both
in
the
form
of
the
investment
that
is
made
with
their
money
while
they
are
putting
their
money
into
the
plan,
and
in
the
form
in
which
they
take
their
money
out.
one
option,
as
suggested
by
this
court
in
manhart,
is
a
lump
sum
payment.
the
employee's
funds
are
invested
over
the
working
career
of
the
employee.
those
funds
earn
interest.
when
the
employee
reaches
the
proper
age
under
the
plan,
there
is
a
given
finite
amount
accumulated
for
that
employee.
that
employee
is
free
to
take
that
entire
amount
out
in
cash.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
there
is
a
tax
problem,
justice
blackmun,
no
matter
how
you
take
your
money
out.
this
is
a
tax
avoidance,
a
deferred
tax
plan,
and
internal
revenue
gets
you
sooner
or
later,
but
your
honor
is
right
if
you
are
suggesting
that
if
you
take
it
out
in
a
lump,
they
get
you
somewhat
sooner.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
yes,
your
honor.
the
state
has
already
removed
that
option
from
the
plan,
based
upon
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
which
enjoined
it
from
continuing
with
sex-based
actuarial
tables.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
really...
i
really
think
the
result
in
this
case
proves
the
error
of
the
decision,
because
i
think
the
result
is
the
worst
possible
result.
as
i
was
saying,
one
of
the
choices
of
the
lump
sum,
and
as
your
honor
points
out,
there
is
a
tax
consequence,
there
is
a
second
choice,
which
is
an
annuity
for
a
fixed
term.
you
can
say
to
the
insurance
company,
i
want
my
money
paid
back
to
me
over
ten
years,
fifteen
years,
twenty
years,
and
again,
in
that
example,
the
male
and
the
female
are
treated
the
same,
because
you
have
removed
the
one
risk
that
is
involved
in
the
life
annuity,
which
is
the
life
expectancy.
so,
under
the
lump
sum
option--
mr.
john
l.
endicott
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
at
the
luncheon
recess
i
was
discussing
the
options
which
are
available
under
the
arizona
deferred
compensation
plan,
and
i
had
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
employees
can
select
the
lump
sum
payment,
a
fixed
term
annuity,
and
the
third
option
which
is
available
is
the
life
annuity.
in
that
one,
in
the
lump
sum
and
the
fixed
term,
the
treatment
of
males
and
females
is
equal.
they
both
get
the
same
lump
sum
payment
or
the
same
monthly
payment.
in
the
life
annuity,
the
actuarial
values
of
the
payments
are
equal,
but
the
monthly
payments
are
different.
the
woman
gets
a
lower
monthly
payment,
and
it
is
that
aspect
of
the
annuity
and
the
program
which
has
brought
us
here
today.
but
nothing
is
available...
nothing
was
available
at
the
times
here
involved
on
the
open
market
which
was
more
favorable
to
women
in
the
form
of
life
annuities.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
state
that
the
plan
offerings
truly
reflect
the
open
market,
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
general
electric
versus
gilbert,
harris
versus
mcrae,
and
indeed
in
manhart
itself,
all
hold
that
the
employer
is
not
responsible
for
the
fact
that
the
open
market
may
treat
women
differently
than
it
treats
men.
nothing
makes
it
illegal
for
insurance
companies
as
opposed
to
employers,
but
nothing
makes
it
illegal
for
insurance
companies
to
recognize
the
different
risks
presented
by
men
and
women,
and
to
treat
women
according
to
the
risks
they
present.
i
submit
also
that
this
case
is
a
misuse
of
title
7.
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
in
this
case
is
not
really
with
anything
that
arizona
has
done
as
an
employer,
but
is
with
the
insurance
industry
practice
of
giving
economic
effect
to
the
fact
that
women
live
longer
than
men.
the
plaintiffs
are
using
title
7
in
this
case
to
punish
the
employer
for
what
the
insurance
industry
has
done,
third
party
insurers,
and
this
court
in
footnote
33
in
manhart
said
that
title
7
does
not
govern
the
relations
between
employees
and
third
parties.
it
governs
relations
between
employers
and
employees,
but
not
with
third
parties.
the
manhart
opinion
suggested
that
if
a
corporate
shell
was
used,
that
was
a
different
case,
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
corporate
shell.
the
insurance
companies
are
independent
and
long-standing
life
insurance
companies,
third
parties.
the
insurance
companies
are
not
the
agents
of
arizona.
this
court
held
in
general
building
contractors
fairly
recently
that
one
of
the
elements
of
agency
is
the
ability
to
control,
and
there
is
no
showing
that
arizona
had
the
ability
to
control
the
insurers
in
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
i
have
to
answer
your
question
by
going
a
little
further,
justice
blackmun.
race
historically
has
been
treated
differently
by
the
congress
of
this
country,
by
this
supreme
court.
it
is
treated
differently
in
the
insurance
industry
by
the
state
insurance
commissioners,
who
have...
or
the
states,
rather,
who
have
regulated
insurance,
have
said,
you
cannot
consider
race
in
insurance.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
actuarial
data
that
would
give
you
a
statistical
basis
or
support
for
treating
people
differently
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
in
a
health
insurance
plan,
a
medical
benefits
plan,
that
could
come
up.
as
i
say,
it
really
can't
in
our
context
because
of
the
state
laws
that
preclude
it,
and
again,
because
there
are
no
actuarial
studies
that
i
am
aware
of
that
indicate
one
race
lives
longer
than
the
other--
mr.
john
l.
endicott
--but
i
think
in
recent
times,
justice
marshall,
that
those
statistics
are
changing
for
the
better.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
i
don't
know
that
anybody
keeps
track
of
it
any
more,
justice
marshall.
certainly
there
is
none
involved
in
this
case.
the
tables
in
this
case
make
no
such
distinction,
and
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
raised
by
anybody
that
women
do
in
fact
live
longer
than
men.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
justice
o'connor,
is
who
was
making
the
distinction.
if
in
this
case
it
were
a
third
party
independent
insurance
company--
mr.
john
l.
endicott
--and
that
was
what
was--
mr.
john
l.
endicott
--and
that
was
what
was
available
and
offered
on
the
open
market?
i
don't
think
that's
the
employer's
responsibility.
i
think
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
ge
gilbert,
harris-mcrae,
manhart,
if
that
problem
exists,
that
is
in
my
opinion
a
social,
political
problem
that
needs
to
be
corrected
by
either
the
congress
or
the
states
who
have
historically
regulated
the
insurance
industry.
i
don't
think
you
should
use
title
7
for
it.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
they
can't
select
the
life
annuity
because--
mr.
john
l.
endicott
--and
the
future
male
and
female
who
would
like
to
retire
and
get
a
life
annuity.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
i
am
very
troubled
by
the
retroactive
aspect
of
the
relief
that
was
ordered
in
this
case,
and
by
other
aspects,
such
as
ordering
the
state
to
pay
money
when
the
state
plan
says
that
this
is
an
employee
plan
only,
but
the
retroactive
aspect
is
troublesome
because
plans
not
so
much
like
arizona,
where
no
funds
are
put
up
by
the
employer,
but
plans
that
have
been
funded
such
as
are
described
in
the
florida
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
they
have
funded
a
plan
on
certain
actuarial
assumptions.
they
were
at
one
time
$4
billion
in
debt.
they
have
got
their
plan
actuarially
sound
now.
they
recognize
the
difference
between
men
and
women.
and
if
you
fashion
relief
which
says
that
as
of
the
date
of
this
decision
or
the
trial
court's
decision
you
now
have
to
pay
those
people
an
amount
you
never
funded
and
reserved
for,
i
think
you
may
bankrupt
and
render
insolvent
a
lot
of
employer-funded
plans.
as
i
say,
it
isn't
so
critical
in
arizona,
because
of,
as
your
honor
points
out,
the
small
number
of
people
involved,
and
really
the
small
dollars
involved,
but
it
again
is
why
i
think
that
if
there
is
to
be
a
change
ordered
in
the
practices
of
the
insurance
companies,
and
that
is
what
your
question
really
assumes,
it
should
be
done
by
a
legislative
body
who
holds
hearings,
takes
evidence,
studies
the
facts,
and
determines
what
they
can
do
without
bankrupting
the
pension
and
insurance
industry
in
this
country.
and
i
don't
think
the
record
before
this
court
is
adequate
for
that
purpose.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
could
arizona,
your
honor?
mr.
john
l.
endicott
there
are
unisex
annuities
being
offered
presently,
as
i
understand
some
of
the
statements
made
in
the
amicus
brief,
and
as
i
understand
chinnerly,
but,
your
honor,
you
have
to
define
what
unisex
means.
unisex
is
a
word
that
everybody
throws
around
as
though
it
had
a
fixed
and
certain
meaning,
and
i
don't
think
it
really
does.
the
statements
that
you
are
seeing,
and
one
of
them
was
made
in
one
of
the
briefs,
was
that,
for
example,
lincoln
national
life
said,
we
will
write
a
unisex
annuity
if
it
is
a
large
enough
group
and
they
take
into
consideration
the
makeup,
the
sexual
makeup
of
the
group.
you
start
with
the
fact
women
do
live
longer
than
men.
therefore,
when
you
reserve,
you
have
got
to
assume
you
are
going
to
pay
more
money
to
women
than
you
are
to
men.
therefore,
you've
got
to
fund
your
plan
that
way.
so,
when
they
talk
about
unisex
annuities,
you've
got
to
define
the
group
of
people
you're
insuring,
know
the
sexual
and
age
makeup
of
it,
and
do
it.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
under
the
arizona
plan,
your
honor,
it
could
not
be
done,
because
it
is
a
voluntary
plan.
people
can
opt
in
or
out,
and
they
can
withdraw
a
lump
sum.
you
can't
fund
that
kind
of
plan,
because
what
will
happen
is,
presumably,
all
the
men
will
opt
out
and
go
buy
a
sex-based
annuity
on
the
open
market,
where
they
get
a
better
return,
all
the
women
will
stay
in,
and
the
unisex
rate
in
the
plan
will
be
the
female
rate
because
they
are
insuring
100
percent
female.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
if
the
unisex
annuity
that
was
offered
was
better
than
the
sex
segregated
rate--
mr.
john
l.
endicott
--no,
if
it
offered
to
pay
the
woman
more
money
per
month
than
the
sex-based
table.
that's
how
i
define
better.
if
she
would
get
more
money
per
month
under
the
sex-based...
under
the
unisex
annuity,
then
i
think
you
would
have
an
inference
that
the
employer
discriminated
or
made
a
discriminatory
judgment
in
not
picking
that
plan
or
not
at
least
offering
that
plan.
but
i
think
the
charge
here...
we
would
still
be
here
today,
your
honor,
if
that
had
happened
and
existed,
because
what
we
are
being
charged
with
is
not...
not
offering
a
unisex
annuity,
but
having
offered
a
sex-based
annuity.
so,
i
don't
know
that
that
would
resolve
the
problem
before
us.
the
problems
involved
in
making
a
change,
as
posed
by
justice
o'connor's
question,
if
you
make
a
change,
are
very
complex.
i
think
the
financial
implications
are
staggering,
and
i
don't
think,
as
i
said,
that
title
7
is
the
proper
way
to
get
at
it.
i
don't
think
you
should
get
an
employer
who
has
picked
what
is
a
available
in
the
open
market,
offered
it
to
his
employees,
and
then
said,
because
what
they
are
doing
on
the
open
market
we
don't
like,
we
are
going
to
punish
you
under
title
7.
i
just
think
that's
the
wrong
way
to
get
at
the
question.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
life
insurance?
mr.
john
l.
endicott
my
recollection
is,
one
of
the
choices
under
the
plan
is
life
insurance.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
they
always
do.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
it's
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
you
need
to
collect
less
per
year
or
per
month.
it
really
is
a
function
of
how
long
you
are
going
to
live
and
how
much
money
you've
got,
and
you
really
divide
life
expectancy
into
the
available
amount
of
money,
forgetting
the
interest
calculations
and
complications,
and
that
tells
you
how
long
you
do
it.
that
is
why
when
they
pay
a
fixed
term
annuity
they
treat
male
and
female
alike.
if
you
know
you
are
going
to
pay
it
for
20
years,
480
months,
you
divide
480
into
$48,000,
and
you
know
you
pay
out
$1,000
a
month.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
age,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
and
age.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
yes.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
but
those
are
the
two--
mr.
john
l.
endicott
--no,
your
honor,
not
generally,
and
not
basically,
they
don't.
it
is
age
and
sex
that
are
the
two
stable...
my
understanding
of
risk
classification
which
is
what
insurance
is
primarily
involved
with,
is
that
in
classifying
risks,
you
have
got
to
have
factors
that
are
stable,
permanent,
and
practical,
and
you
can
look
at
smoking,
you
can
look
at
eating,
you
can
look
at
the
person's
weight,
you
can
look
at
drinking,
and
there
are
some
plans
on
the
market
today
that
make
some
reflection
of
that,
but
the
two
basic
unchanging
factors
are
sex
and
age.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
if
they
can
identify
them.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
yes.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
and
as
your
honor
probably
knows,
they
rate
people.
if
you
do
certain
things,
you
pay
a
higher
premium
than
other
people
who
don't.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
i
believe
in
the
group
policy
context,
to
the
extent
i
am
aware
of
it,
your
honor,
it
makes
no
difference,
and
the
whole
purpose
of
group
is
to
underwrite
a
large
group
of
people
cheaply,
usually
without
medical
examinations,
usually
without
much
medical
history.
if
they
work
in
the
group,
the
law
of
large
numbers
works,
and
you
treat
the
people
according
to
the
fact
that
they
are
an
element
of
the
group.
it
gives
you
a
problem
with
treating
people
individually,
but
you
treat
them
as
a
unit
of
the
group.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
not
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
justice
stevens,
you
know,
the
funny
thing
is
that
in
annuities,
you
get
a
self-selection
working
whereby
all
your
poor
life
risks
don't
opt
for
a
life
annuity.
the
person
who
knows
they
are
going
to...
they
come
from
a
short-lived
family
and
are
in
bad
health,
they
want
the
lump
sum.
they
want
to
spend
it
while
they
are
still
here.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
so
you
get
a
self--
mr.
john
l.
endicott
--yes,
but
you
can
pick
a
ten-year
certain,
or
a
fifteen-year...
if
you
want
to
take
the
risk
of
estimating
how
long
you
are
going
to
live,
you
pick
a
fixed
term
policy
and
do
it
that
way.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
i
think
that
is
a
reasonable
assumption.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
identifiably.
there
are
some
who
are
going
to
be
unexpectedly
short-term.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
and
that
is
what
makes
your
statistics.
i
mean,
some
people
are
going
to
get
more
out
than
they
put
in
because
they
live
longer.
some
people
are
going
to
get
just
about
out
what
they
put
in.
some
people
are
going
to
get
much
less
out.
but
they
have
all
had
the
same
chance
going
in
to
recover
what
they
invested,
and
they
have
all
opted
to
have
an
insurance
company
take
the
risk
of
how
long
they
are
going
to
live.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
i
am
not
aware
of
anything
in
this
record
that
would
reflect
on
that.
this
plan,
your
honor,
covered
the
employees
of
the
state
of
arizona,
so
it
covered
a
very
wide
group--
mr.
john
l.
endicott
--of
occupations.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
justice
marshall
suggested
to
me
earlier
that
it
went
back
100
or
more
years.
they
have
kept
tables
for
many
years,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
they
keep
updating
the
table.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
oh,
i
would
believe
that
it
goes
back
probably
into
the
1600's
or
1700's,
but
the
tables
keep
being
changed.
i
mean,
they
still
aren't
using
tables
from
three
centuries
ago.
i
think
the
last
one
i
saw
referred
to
in
one
of
the
briefs
was
either
1980
or
1978.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
deferred
compensation
plans,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
i
believe
there
are
a
number.
arizona
was
one
of
the
first
to
do
it,
but
there
are
a
number
that
have
it,
and
almost
all
states
have
retirement
or
pension
plans,
of
course.
as
i
said
much
earlier
in
answer
to
a
question,
i
think
the
best
evidence
of
the
error
of
this
decision
is
the
result.
before
the
decision
by
the
trial
court
in
this
case,
the
employees
in
arizona
had
a
choice
of
what
they
could
buy
with
their
money,
and
one
of
those
choices
was
a
life
annuity,
and
those
people
who
thought
they
would
live
long
enough
to
make
that
profitable
were
free
to
make
that
choice.
now,
as
a
result
of
the
decision
in
this
case,
the
only
result
has
been,
we
have
removed
the
choice
from
the
plan,
and
we
were
enjoined
to
do,
and
the
employees
of
the
state
of
arizona
have
less
choices
than
they
had
before.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
under
our...
under
the
arizona
plan,
where
people
have
a
choice
of
options,
justice
stevens,
and
where
they
don't
need
to
make
a
decision
until
they're
65
and
retire,
the
odds
are,
as
i
said
earlier,
that
i
think
you
would
end
up
with
a
female
table
being
used
to
create
the
unisex
rate
because
the
insurer
would
have
to
assume
the
worst
possible
case,
and
that
is
that
he
is
going
to
have
100
percent
female
life
annuitants,
and
he
is
going
to
use
the
female
rate.
so,
you
haven't,
i
don't
think,
accomplished
much
in
that
way.
in
conclusion,
then,
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
think
it
is
clear
that
arizona...
arizona
did
not
discriminate
against
its
women
employees
by
offering
them
the
opportunity
to
purchase
a
life
annuity
through
the
deferred
compensation
plan,
and
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
just
one
or
two
points.
there
were
questions
early
in
ms.
gittler's
argument
about
who
holds
title
to
the
money
and
where
the
money
goes.
now,
as
the
court
knows,
this
is
a
deferred
compensation
plan.
internal
revenue
takes
the
position
that
if
the
employee
receives
the
money,
it
is
taxable
at
the
time
of
receipt.
so
the
law
is
structured
so
that
the
employee
does
not
actually
receive
or
constructively
receive
the
money.
but
the
money
is
actually
put
with
the
insurance
company,
the
savings
bank,
the
mutual
fund,
or
wherever
the
employee
directs
it.
the
promise
by
the
state
to
return
that
money
is
an
unequivocal
promise.
the
only
way
the
state
could
not
do
it
is
to
breach
its
promise.
mr.
john
l.
endicott
two
answers
to
your
questions,
your
honor.
first,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
the
subject.
it
was
not
discussed.
it
isn't
revealed
by
the
record.
number
two,
we
are
all
speculating
as
to
what
men
would
do,
what
women
would
do,
what
insurance
companies
would
do.
it
is
why
i
suggested
much
earlier
that
i
think
this
presents
a
much
broader
social,
political
question
than
can
be
resolved
in
a
title
7
context--
mr.
john
l.
endicott
--congress
is
presently
considering
legislation,
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
right
now
quite
actively.
there
are
one
or
more
bills
pending
in
the
house,
at
least,
dealing
with
the
question
of
should
there
be
sex
segregation
in
insurance,
casualty
insurance,
life
insurance,
pensions,
annuities.
the
whole
thing
is
before
congress.
yes,
your
honor.
one
final
point,
if
i
may.
the
statement
was
made
that
manhart
solves
this
case,
and
i
submit
manhart
does
not.
manhart
dealt
with
a
situation
in
which
the
woman
took
home
less
money.
it
confined
itself
to
that
situation.
here
is
a
case
where
the
woman
takes
home
the
same
pay
throughout
her
life.
it
is
only
after
her
employment
status
has
ceased,
she
has
retired,
she
is
getting
money
from
an
insurance
company,
that
she
gets
less
per
month.
and
the
assumption
that
because
she
gets
less
per
month
she
is
being
discriminated
against
is
one
that
again
raises
more
questions
than
just
simple
mathematics.
if
i
promise
to
pay
you
$50
a
month
for
20
months,
and
i
promise
to
pay
someone
else
$100
a
month
for
ten
months,
clearly
$50
a
month
is
less
than
$100
a
month,
but
it
doesn't
mean
the
person
who
gets
$50
a
month
is
being
discriminated
against.
they
are
going
to
get
it
longer.
they
will
net
out
the
same.
and
the
assumption
of
the
actuarial
tables
is,
you
take
the
money
the
employee
has
set
aside,
divide
it
by
their
life
expectancy,
and
they
recoup
their
money,
and
it
is
their
money
they
are
concerned
with.
the
argument
that
arizona
could
have
self-insured
is
contrary
to
the
arizona
statute
that
created
the
deferred
compensation
plan,
which
said
that
arizona
was
not
to
contribute
money
to
the
plan.
once
you
self-insure,
you
are
taking
the
risk
of
insurance,
and
insurance
companies
do
pay
money
out,
sometimes
more
than
they
take.
thank
you.
