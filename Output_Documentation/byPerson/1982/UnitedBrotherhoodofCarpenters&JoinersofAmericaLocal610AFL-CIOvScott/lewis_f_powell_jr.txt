justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
gold,
i
want
to
understand
you.
are
you
saying
that,
though
a
constitutional
right
for
an
individual
to
decide
whether
he
wishes
to
work
for
a
non-union
or
prefers
to
work
for
a
union
employer...
in
other
words,
a
man
is
looking
for
employment.
he
may
choose
a
union
shop,
a
closed
shop,
or
an
employer
with
no
union
connections
whatever.
you
are
saying
he
does
not
have
that
right
to
make
that
choice?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
think
the
state
could
forbid
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
could
the
state
enact
a
statute
that
said
everyone
who
seeks
employment
in
this
state
must
seek
non-union
employment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
any
provision
in
the
constitution
forbid
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would
not
like
it,
would
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
i
was
wondering
about
the
right
of
an
individual
to
make
a
choice
as
to
where
he
wishes
to
work
and
with
and
for
whom.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
under
any
provision
of
the
constitution--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--this
sounds
like
the
soviet
union
to
me
where
they
tell
you
where
you
can
work
and
where
you
cannot.
how
about
the
thirteenth
amendment?
