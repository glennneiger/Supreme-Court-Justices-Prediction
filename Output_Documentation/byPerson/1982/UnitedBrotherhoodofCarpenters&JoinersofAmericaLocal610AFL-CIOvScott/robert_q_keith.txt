mr.
robert
q.
keith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
of
my
presentation,
may
i
revert
to
the
facts
momentarily,
and
we
might
start
with
the
dissent
of
the
fifth
circuit
who
called
this
an
unprovoked
and
brutal
attack
on
law-abiding
citizens.
the
trial
court
in
his
opinion
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
stated
that
this
arose
out
of
a
demonstration
or
citizen
protest
where
people
were
voicing
concern
over
outside,
non-union
workers
in
a
union
area
much
like
the
vermonter,
the
northerner,
who
was
traveling
to
the
south
in
reconstruction
times.
these
two
statements
were
based
on
fact,
and
they
were
best
capsulated
by
the
attorney
for
defendant
in
the
opening
statement
to
the
trial
court
when
he
said,
and
it
becomes
important
to
the
legislative
history,
what
happened
here...
and
this
is
the
attorney
for
the
defendant...
what
happened
here
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
labor
organizations
are
strong
in
this
area
when
outside
contractors
come
into
the
area
employing
people
from
outside
the
state.
just
as
senator
edmund
in
1871
was
concerned
with
the
northerner,
the
vermonter,
the
republican,
the
democrat,
the
methodist,
the
catholic
and
the
recently
freed
man,
this
case
comes
as
close
factually
to
any
case
that
has
ever
been
before
any
of
the
courts
under
1985(3).
in
griffin
the
court
set
out
four
elements,
and
if
i
may
respectfully
refer
to
them
as
the
court
did
and
gave
them
a
separate
number.
one,
that
the
defendants
conspired,
and
there
was
a
conspiracy.
secondly,
that
such
was
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
any
person
or
class
of
persons
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
or
equal--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--yes,
sir.
it
is.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
the
record
shows,
your
honor,
that
in
this
particular
geographic
locality,
and
all
of
the
evidence
is
that
the
labor
movement
and
particularly
in
the
construction
trades,
is
very,
very
pervasive.
this
is
on
the
texas
gulf
coast.
the
oil
and
chemical
industries
are
the
dominant
employers,
and
there
is
very
heavy
union
organization.
it
has
been
since
the
1930s.
this
dispute
arose
and
this
attack
arose
out
of
the
outsider
coming
in
and
choosing
to
associate
with
other
non-union
workers.
in
griffin,
the
court
spoke
of
this
equal
protection
concept,
meaning
that
there
must
be
some
class-based
invidiously
discriminatory
animus.
the
circuit
found,
and
i
think
there
is
clear
evidence,
that
there
was
pervasive
animus
both
in
extent
and
intensity.
men
were
beaten
with
two-by-fours,
with
iron
bars.
equipment
was
turned
over,
drag
lines,
bulldozers,
big
saws,
offices.
men
were
beaten
over
the
head.
they
were
hospitalized.
buildings
were
pillaged
and
burned.
this
was
the
act
done
in
furtherance
of
that
conspiracy,
and
then
we
come
respectfully
to
section
4(a)
as
analyzed
by
griffin
and
that
is,
whereby
another
was
injured
in
his
person
or
property.
very
clearly
my
clients
as
plaintiffs
were
injured
in
their
personal
property.
this
injury
arose
out
of
this
invidiously
discriminatory
animus.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
best
said,
it
deprived
us,
if
i
may
code
myself
as
a
plaintiff
for
the
moment...
it
deprived
us
of
the
equal
enjoyment
of
personal
security
which
all
of
us
enjoy
under
the
law.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir,
and
i
believe
the
court's
decision
in
griffin
and
the
legislative
history
will
support
that.
furthermore--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--griffin
was
at
least
a
thirteenth
amendment
case
and
a
right
to
travel
case,
and
griffin
spoke
in
this
instance
of
a
class-based
invidiously
discriminatory
animus.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir,
but
that
is
the
right
that
is
violated.
bear
in
mind
this,
that
the
federal
statute
was
aimed
at
the
conspiracy.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
in
this
case
i
have,
we
have
the
right
to
enjoy
equally
the
security
from
unprovoked
attack.
we
also
have
under
the
privileges--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--no,
sir,
not
at
all.
there
must
be
a
class-based--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--if
there
is
a
class-based
invidiously
discriminatory
animus
that
is
both
pervasive
as
in...
to
extent
and
intensity,
yes.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
but
there
must
be
a
conspiracy.
i
could
not...
in
abstract
one
person
cannot
commit
an
act
and
thus
violate
1985(3).
there
must
be
those
acting
in
concert
under
conspiracy.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
correct.
nowhere
in
1985(3)
is
that
necessary.
you
see,
at
the
time
they
adopted
this
there
were
four
other
provisions
that
were
adopted
also,
and
state
action
and
interference
with
state
action
are
dealt
with
separately.
so
we
do
not
need
to
look
to
those
as
you
consider
1985(3).
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir,
or
enjoyment
of
equal
privileges
and
immunities.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
we
claim
in
this
instance,
sir,
under--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
we
do
not
claim--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--the
congress,
your
honor,
did
not
say
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
they
say--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--that
is
correct,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
they
took
the
concept
of
equal--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--they
left
the
state
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
now,
there
is
a
view
supported
by
the
legislative
history
that
at
the
time
congress
enacted
this
that
they
thought
they
were
enacting
a
statute
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
section
five,
but
we
do
not
need
to
reach
that
in
this
case.
bear
in
mind
this,
if
i
may
pursue
it
a
moment
more,
when
we
speak
of
the
equal
protection,
we
are
speaking
about
the
animus.
we
are
not
speaking
about
some
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
we
are
speaking
about
the
animus,
and
in
this
instance
that
animus
was
to
deprive
us
of
equal
enjoyment
of
the
law
in
peace
and
security
to
our
person.
the
animus
also
extended
to
equal
privileges
and
immunities
in
that
we
had
the
right
to
choose
with
whom
we
associated.
in
the
exercise
of
that
right
under
the
first
amendment
if
you
bring
the
state
in,
but
in
the
exercise
of
our
right
of
association
we
then
became
brutally
and
violently
assaulted.
the
animus,
your
honor,
was
affected
in
this
case
both
by
equal
protection
and
equal
privileges
and
immunities.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
sir,
it
is
not
that
you
were
deprived,
thus
injured,
thus
you
have
a
cause
of
action.
there
was
no
depravation
which
in
a
causal
proximate
cause
sense
led
to
this
cause
of
action.
the
denial,
if
you
will,
relates
to
the
animus.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
none.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
in
this
instance
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
at
this
time--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--today,
yes,
sir.
congress
clearly
has
a
constitutional
authority--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--at
the
time
congress
adopted
1985,
their
perception
was
that
this
was
a
wrong
that
needed
correcting
and
that
they
had
the
authority
to
do
so
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
court
does
not
need
to
address
that
question
in
this
case.
that
may
be
another
day
and
another
time.
the
congress
has
the
authority
under
the
commerce
clause,
clearly
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
to
adopt
1985(3).
this
was
a
federal
project.
it
involved--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
as
i
understand
the
test
today,
sir--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--the
commerce
clause
was
given
a
more
restrictive
application
100
years
ago,
yes,
but
the
question
today
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
and
the
authority
of
congress
to
enact
it.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no,
sir.
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
limit
congress'
action.
congress
was
federalizing
a
particular
offense.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
under
the
authority
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
congress
says--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--that
was
the
type
of
question
that
was
subject
to
the
debate,
exactly.
when
congress
enacted
what
this
court
has
called
section
2,
that
is,
the
discriminatory
animus,
instead
of
adopting
this
general
murder
statute,
congress
adopted
the
limiting
amendment
which
requires
the
animus
that
we
have
spoken
of.
the
animus
is
to
deprive
one
under
these
circumstances
of
equal
protection,
that
is
the
equal
enjoyment
of
the
laws
or
equal
privilege
under
the
laws.
now--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--no,
justice
o'connor.
bear
in
mind
that
class
is
really
defined
in
the
mind
of
the
defendants.
it
is
the
defendant's
perception
that
these
people,
whomever
they
may
be,
in
this
case
those
who
were
associating
on
this
job,
are
morally
inferior.
for
some
reason
they
lack
the
same
standing
under
the
law
as
the
rest
of
us.
they
are
not
entitled
to
the
same
protection
under
the
law.
in
this
instance--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--as
represented
by
their
res
gestae
statements
at
the
time
and
as
represented
by
their
conspiratorial
actions
before
and
in
the
acts
done
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy,
yes.
in
this
instance
the
res
gestae
statements
are,
man,
get
out
of
here.
you
are
crazy.
this
is
union
country.
get
out
of
jefferson
county
and
don't
set
your
feet
back
in
here.
much
like
the
jewish
people
at
the
synagogue,
or
the
catholics
at
mass,
these
people
were
assaulted
at
a
place
where
they
congregate,
where
they
associate,
as
they
have
under
state
law
as
well
as
federal
law
a
right
to
do.
hypothetically
there
may
be
some
other
circumstance
that
would
be
more
arguable
as
to
whether
it
is
or
is
not
a
class,
but
clearly
it
is
not
a
rule
23
class
such
as
numerocity,
commonality,
and
definiteness.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no.
i
could
limit
it
in
a
number
of
different
ways,
but
there
would
not
be
class...
it
would
not
necessarily
be
a
conspiracy,
although
you
might
say
the
men
by
their
charter
agree
to
something.
there
would
not
be
any
animus
of
the
type,
and
the
fifth
circuit
spoke
of
this,
of
the
type
the
framers
of
the
amendment
were
intending.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
if
they
are
beaten
and
assaulted
because
of
that
status--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--excluded--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--i
do
not
perceive
that
as
the
animus
conceived
by
the--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--yes,
sir,
in
part
the
freedmen,
but
it
was
basically
economic
in
that
the
northerner,
the
vermonter,
the
freedman
was
now
taking
over
the
place
or
taking
a
place
in
this
new
economic
order.
the
act
was
basically
derived
at
those
who
were
exercising
economic
activity.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir,
they
were.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir.
i
did
not
understand
the
question.
the--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--yes,
sir,
but
what
was
happening
was--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--what
was
happening
was
that
the
northerner
was
going
to
the
south,
was
being
elected
to
the
legislature,
was
operating
stores.
he
was
being
beaten
and
pillaged
and
violated
just
as
was
the
freedman.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
legislative
history
spoke
to
was
the
conduct
toward
the
black
man
and
toward
these
new
persons
in
the
community.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
well,
respectfully,
there
are
just
two.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
well--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--speaking
of
the--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--griffin
since
1962
is
the
only
time
that
this
court
has
really
written
on
this
1985(3),
and
those
men--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--there
is
an
action
in
the
state
court,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no,
sir,
not
in
any
way.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
i
have
never
brought
a
state
court
suit.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
i
never
brought
this
as
a
state
court
suit.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
my
plaintiffs
in
this
case
brought
one
law
suit
and
that
was
in
this
court.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
we
could
have
brought
a
law
suit
in
the
state
court.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
am
i
free
to
answer
that
question
as
the
lawyer
who
brought
the
case?
the
reason
why
it
was,
at
the
very
time
i
brought
this
suit,
there
were
two
state
court
proceedings
going
on
involving
identical
issues
where
the
parties
plaintiff
were
getting
their
brains
beaten
out,
unable
to
get
an
injunction,
and
i
was
first
seeking
an
injunction
for
my
clients
to
protect
them
as
they
returned
to
work.
i
was
confident
that
with
the
difficulties
these
other
plaintiffs
were
having
at
the
exact
same
time,
i
could
not
get
an
injunction.
so
i
sought
a
remedy
under
the
federal
law
where
i
could
obtain
an
injunction.
that
is
why
i
brought
the
suit
in
the
federal
court.
it
is
the
only
law
suit
that
we
have
ever
brought--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--well,
it
has
not
been
easy.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no,
sir,
it
is
no
easier
today.
but
very
clearly,
and
if
i
may
respectfully
distinguish
my
case
from
dombrowski
or
novotny.
in
this
case,
my
clients
suffered
injury
to
person
and
property
as
described
by
section
4(a)
very
clearly.
in
dombrowski
out
of
the
sixth
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit,
or
novotny,
neither
of
those
plaintiffs
suffered
injury
to
person
or
property.
and
in
griffin
the
court
said
that
there
was
a
recovery
for
those
who
suffer
injury
to
personal
property
or
to
those
who
are
denied
equal
privileges
and
immunities
as
citizens
of
the
national
government.
so
i
would
respectfully
say
to
you
that
this
case
is
legally
and
factually
different
from
each
of
those
for
that
very
reason.
those
two
cases
were
what
we
have
called,
in
our
brief,
section
4(b)
cases
which,
mr.
justice
white,
would
or
do
call
for
a
"violation
of
a
constitutional
right"
which
in
this
instance
would
call
for
either
a
racial
violation,
a
travel
violation
or
a
state
action
involved.
if
i
may
answer
the
question
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
are
there
other
constitutional
rights
that
may
be
involved.
we
can
conceive
of
none
except
as
a
person
may
be
enjoying
security
or
freedom
or
peace
from
assault.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
equal
protection
under
the
laws--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--then
there
would
be
no
inequality
of
protection.
certainly
that
is
true,
but
in
this
instance
and
in
no
circumstances
have
been
presented
the
case
that
you
posit.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
i
have--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--i
have
the
right
under
the
state
law
to
this
freedom,
and
then
i
have
the
right
as
a
federal
citizen,
a
national
citizen,
to
equal
application
of
that
law.
when
the
marauder
takes
it
in
his
own
hands
and
treats
me
differently,
irrationally,
for
no
legitimate
reason,
then--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--no,
sir,
indeed
not--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--and
if
they
were
class-based--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--animus--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--and
with
this
invidious
discrimination,
yes--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--but
only
if
there
is
that
conspiracy
with
that
class-based
discriminatory
animus.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
correct,
but
that
is
the
animus,
your
honor.
that
is
not
necessarily
the
cause
of
action.
that
is
just
an
element
of
it,
and
this
so-called
violation
does
not
need
to
lead
to
injury
in
a
proximate
cause
sense.
all
this
does
was
show
that
the
animus
arose
in
this
violation
of
my
equal
protection.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
state
action
here,
nor
is
there
any
required
if
you
have
injury
to
person
or
property
as
described
under
section
4.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
it
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
not
without
showing
that
there
was,
in
fact,
this
animus.
i
may
have
been
able
to
do
so
circumstantially.
but--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--no,
sir.
i
do
not.
the
court--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--we
do
not
have
to
go
that
far.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
basically
correct.
if
this
court
should
hold
that
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
grants
this
power
to
congress,
then
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
is
correct
on
that
basis.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
we
do
not
have
to
go
that
far.
that
is
a
heavier
load
to
carry
than
we
need
to
carry
to
prevail
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no,
sir.
we
did
not.
we
submitted
the
larger
view
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
well,
i
am
here
defending
them,
your
honor,
but
i
say
that--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--we
can
affirm
my
case
without
going
as
far
as
we
ask--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--thank
you,
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
indeed,
and
that
is
the
only
difference
that
we
have
with
the
court
of
appeals
is
this--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--we
did
not
think
it
was
necessary--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--we
did
not
think
it
was
necessary
to
make,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
probably
the
answer
to
my
question,
yes.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
in
the
minds
of
the
defendants
and
those
whom
they
struck
out
against
were
a
group
of
men
associated
at
a
particular
work
site
who
had
chosen
to--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
as
it
turned
out
there
was
also
a
subcontractor
on
the
job
who
had
been
notified--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--yes,
sir,
because
they
were
associated
as
non-union
workers
exercising
that
right,
not
the
right
to
work
non-union
but
the
right
to
associate.
they
were
at
this
place
just
as
the
jewish
people
might
be
at
the
synagogue.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
either
way,
they
had
the
right
to
be
there
and
to
express
themselves
in
that
manner
and
they
chose
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
they
do.
yes,
sir.
one
is
equal
protection.
one
is
privileges
and
immunities,
yes.
they
have
both
rights
as
federal
citizens.
have
i
answered
your
question?
thank
you,
sir.
