mr.
laurence
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
case
concerns
the
scope
of
42
u.s.c.
section
1985(3),
the
lineal
descendent
provision
of
section
2
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act.
as
the
court
of
appeals
majority
stated,
this
case
grows
out
of
an
episode
of
mob
violence
at
the
alligator
bayou
pumping
station
construction
site
near
port
arthur,
texas
that
caused
both
serious
injuries
and
substantial
property
damage.
that
wrongdoing
led
to
this
federal
court
suit
brought
by
two
individuals
and
by
the
general
contractor
at
that
job
site
and
to
avert
it
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
and
against
three
local
unions
which
are
the
petitioners
here.
the
basic
legal
questions
on
which
the
fifth
circuit
sitting
en
banc
split
14
to
nine
concern
the
meaning
of
the
phrases
"equal
protection
of
the
laws"
and
"equal
privileges
and
immunities
under
the
laws.
"
as
used
in
section
1985(3).
mr.
laurence
gold
i
am
hard
pressed
to
understand
that
myself,
justice
o'connor.
i
take
it
that
the
hope
here
was
that
this
would
be
a
more
effective
law
suit
from
the
plaintiffs'
standpoint
despite
the--
mr.
laurence
gold
--that
is,
certainly
in
light
of
the
civil
rights
act
attorney's
fees
statute,
that
could
well
be
a
motive,
and
the
countervailing...
why
the
plaintiffs
were
not
impressed
by
the
countervailing
consideration
that
there
are
very,
very
difficult
legal
questions
here
and
a
straightforward
tort
case
in
the
state
court
system,
i
am
really
not
privy
to--
mr.
laurence
gold
--there
are
also
appellate
judges
in
texas
up
and
down
the
system,
and
i
can
only
say
that
there
isn't
a
whisper
in
this
record
that
the
state
justice
system
was
not
open
to
and
fully
protective
of
the
rights
and
interests
of
plaintiff
companies
and
non-union
employees
in
the
state
of
texas.
indeed,
there
were
13
indictments
growing
out
of
this
episode,
three
convictions,
two
people
in
jail
for
substantial
terms
indeed.
so
in
all
those
respects
this
is
not
your
garden
variety
case
for
choosing
a
federal
court
as
opposed
to
a
state
court.
the
en
banc
majority
below
analyzed
section
1985(3)
as
requiring
a
showing
aside
from
the
conspiracy
and
acts
pursuant
to
the
conspiracy
and
injury
are
the
violation
of
some
protected
right
and
moreover
class-based
invidiously
discriminatory
animus
motivating
the
invasion
of
that
right
and
motivating
the
conspiracy.
the
court
found
that
the
right
of
economic
association
is
such
a
protected
right
and,
indeed,
analyzed
the
matter
as
comprising
a
protected
right
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
that
court
rejected
our
contention
that
for
1985(3),
as
is
generally
true,
to
show
the
invasion
of
a
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
right
as
opposed
to
the
invasion
of
the
rights
guaranteed
by
the
thirteenth
amendment
or
the
rights
guaranteed
by
the
right
of
travel.
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
state
action.
that
court
took
the
view
that
the
contention
i
have
just
outlined
had
been
rejected
in
griffin
v.
breckenridge,
this
court's
leading
modern
case
on
the
scope
of
section
1985(3).
we
cannot
improve
upon,
and
we
have
quoted
at
page
39
of
our
opening
brief,
the
blue
brief,
the
analysis
of
this
issue
by
justice
stevens
in
novotny.
we
rest
on
that
analysis
and
in
terms
of
an
analysis
of
the
statute,
neither
the
court
below
nor
the
respondents
challenge
the
accuracy
of
the
insights
stated
there.
rather
both
contend
that
that
view
of
the
statute
is
precluded
by
griffin.
it
is
our
view
that
griffin
simply
did
not
address
this
problem.
griffin
was
a
case
involving
a
conspiracy
aimed
at
black
americans
attempting
to
assert
their
civil
rights
and
those
who
would
assist
them.
the
court
analyzed
the
matter
as
resting
on
the
thirteenth
amendment
base
and
the
right
and
power
of
congress
to
do
away
with
the
badges
and
incidence
of
slavery.
it
is
perfectly
well
settled
that
congress
in
no
way,
shape,
or
form
is
limited
by
a
state
action
requirement
in
those
regards
and
that
those
constitutional
rights,
both
the
rights
vouchsafed
by
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
the
rights
stated
by
the
right
of
travel
are
protected
against
private
interferences.
mr.
laurence
gold
from
our
view
of
the
cases,
justice
rehnquist,
we
know
of
no
other
constitutional
rights
which
are,
of
those
stated
in
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendment,
which
do
no
have
a
state
action
component
to
them.
and
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
congress
would
be
particularly
concerned
about
thirteenth
amendment
rights
in
terms
of
the
1871
act
because
the
voluminous
legislative
history
is
instinct
on
every
page
with
a
desire
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
newly
enfranchised
freedmen
and
to
ensure
that
the
wrongdoing
that
was
taking
place
in
the
south
against
them
would
have
a
federal
remedy.
at
the
same
time,
section
2,
which
was
the
point
of
controversy
in
the
1871
act,
was
shaped
by
the
moderate
republicans
in
the
house
who
were
not
only
mindful
of
that
major
interest
and
concern,
the
one
i
have
just
outlined,
but
also
saw
an
important
value
in
maintaining
a
system
of
federalism
at
the
time
as
they
understood
that
system.
the
debate
in
the
house
and
the
strong
controversy
that
section
2,
as
originally
introduced,
created,
which
has
been
noted
by
this
court
in
numerous
decisions,
concerned
how
to
advance
both
these
values.
if
there
had
only
been
one
value,
the
need
to
end
what
was
seen
by
every
segment
of
the
majority
party
at
that
time,
the
republicans,
as
outrages
in
the
south,
there
would
have
been
no
division,
no
compromise,
no
internal
controversy
in
the
house.
but
there
was
this
understanding
of
the
fact
that
there
were
two
values
and
a
desire
to
put
down
klan
violence
without
doing
violence
to
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments
as
the
moderate
republicans
understood
those
amendments.
the
moderates
prevailed.
the
section
2
was
rewritten
in
response
to
representative
garfield's
speech,
which
we
have
laid
out
at
perhaps
overly
great
length
in
our
brief.
there
is
no
doubt
when
you
read
the
debate
that
section
2
of
the
1871
act
was
redrafted
to
meet
that
speech
and
had
probably
been
redrafted
before
the
speech
was
given
because
it
concludes
with
representative
garfield
saying
i'm
confident
that
language
can
be
drafted
which
will
meet
these
concerns,
concerns
about
the
federal
government
intruding
into
the
proper
state
domain
and
becoming
the
primary
guarantor
of
property
and
individual
rights.
low
and
behold
the
next
day
representative
shellabarger,
who
was
managing
the
bill,
comes
in
and
says
here
is
an
amendment
presented
by
friends
of
this
legislation
to
assure
that
we
can
go
forward,
and
the
amendment,
by
adding
the
terms
"equal
protection
of
the
laws"
and
"equal
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
laws.
"
met
precisely
the
lines
and
the
concerns
stated
by
representative
garfield.
if
we
are
right
in
that
point,
since
there
is
not
a
hint
of
state
action
in
this
case,
the
decision
below
must
be
reversed.
but
even
if
it
is
viewed,
even
if
the
statute
is
viewed
as
protecting
basic
constitutional
rights
against
private
conspiracy
where
there
is
no
state
action,
we
think
the
same
result
follows,
because
the
court
below
was
of
the
view
that
working
for
a
non-union
employer
is
a
first
amendment
right.
it
is
our
understanding
based
on
this
court's
cases
that
the
particular
economic
relations
between
employers
and
employees
is
not
governed
by
the
first
amendment
but
is
governed
by
state
law
and
congress'
power
to
enact
legislation
pursuant
to
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
if
smith
v.
arkansas
does
not
take
away
our
dreams
on
that
point,
i
do
not
know
what
will.
mr.
laurence
gold
he
may
have
a
right
in
some
abstract
sense
of
that
term--
mr.
laurence
gold
--could
the...
i
apologize--
mr.
laurence
gold
--i
do
not
think
that
the
first
amendment--
mr.
laurence
gold
--whether
substantive
due
process
would
return--
mr.
laurence
gold
--no.
i
think
we
had
as
much
substantive
due
process
is
we
could
stand
through
the
first
third
of
this
century,
but
it
is
our
understanding
and
our
view
that
insofar
as
the
state
regulates
whether
there
will
be
a
collective
bargaining
system
or
there
will
be
a
system
of
managerial
prerogative
and
insofar
as
the
state
regulates
whether
individuals
will
work
in
a
system
where
terms
and
conditions
are
set
one
way
or
another
and
insofar
as
the
state
regulates
even
a
matter
such
as,
or
the
congress
in
each
instance,
regulates
whether
there
will
be
a
union
that
represents
all
the
people
on
a
particular
job,
those
are
not
first
amendment
questions.
there
is
no
right
of
economic
freedom
of
association
of
the
kind
the
court
of
appeals
was
talking
about
any
more
than
there
is
a
right
of
free
association
to
set
up
certain
kinds
of
corporations
or
certain
kinds
of
partnerships
of
the
kind
entrepreneurs
may
find
beneficial
to
their
interest
free
and
clear
of
state
regulation
of
the
field.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
sherman
act
is
either
required
by
or
is
to
be
tested
against
the
first
amendment.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
do
not
believe
that
an
individual
has
such
a
constitutional
right
under
the
first
amendment.
let
me--
mr.
laurence
gold
--i
know
of
no
provision.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
was
wondering
about
that.
i
do
not
think
that
if,
for
example...
let
me
try
to
grapple
with
the
question
in
this
way.
if
in
a
particular
area
there
are
no
places
of
employment
where
unions
have
succeeded
in
becoming
majority
representatives
as
provided
for
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
i
do
not
think
an
individual
could
sue
anybody
on
the
view
that
he
was
being
deprived
of
his
right
to
work
under
union
conditions.
on
the
other
hand,
if
unions
succeeded
in
organizing
the
places
of
employment
in
the
locality,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
opposite
law
suit
would
lie,
either.
obviously
the
individual
has
a
freedom.
perhaps
this
is
the
clearest
i
can
be
in
answering
this.
i
believe
that
the
individual
has
a
freedom
to
move
from
place
to
place
and
to
look
for
employment
that
suits
him.
i
do
not
believe
that
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
demand
that
certain
conditions
obtain.
the
second
element
that
the
court
of
appeals
understood
to
be
encompassed
in
section
1985(3)
or
at
least
in
the
aspect
we
are
discussing
here,
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
equal
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
laws
aspect
of
the
statute,
is
a
requirement
that
there
be
a
showing
of
class-based
invidiously
discriminatory
animus
and
that
court
segmented
that
requirement
as
follows:
first
the
court
stated
that
such
animus
is
shown
if
there
is
animus
against
a
class
of
those
with
common
characteristics
of
an
inherent
nature
and
secondly,
a
particular
application
here,
recognizing
that
there
was
no
such
class,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
statute
also
encompasses
conspiracies
motivated
by
an
animus
of
the
kind
congress
was
trying
to
protect
against
in
enacting
the
1871
act.
the
court
of
appeals
read
the
legislative
history
of
the
1871
act
to
show
an
intent
to
act
against
conspiracies
motivated
by
an
animus
against
exercises
of
the
right
of
economic
association,
which
exercises
of
that
right
ignite
regional
hostility.
it
is
our
view
that
that
dramatically
overreads
the
statute
and
congress'
intent
therein.
we
know
what
the
core
of
what
congress
sought
to
do
was.
it
was
to
protect
the
freedmen
and
those
who
were
seeking
to
assure
that
the
freedmen
secured
the
rights
provided
by
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendment.
every
page
of
the
legislative
history
is
instinct
with
that
intention
except
for
scattered
passages
and
in
the
very
considerable
legislative
history
debated,
i
might
say,
at
a
very
high
and
intense
level
given
the
gravity
of
the
moment,
there
are
no
other
references
to
a
congressional
intent.
in
griffin
the
court
left
open
the
question
of
whether
any
intent
under
other
than
racial
animus
or
bias
supports
a
1985(3)
cause
of
action.
it
is
our
position
that
given
the
fact
that
this
is
a
statute
stated
in
general
terms,
one
can
generalize
from
the
particular
concerns
of
congress.
we
would
formulate
the
animus
test
as
class-based
animus
against
those
who
have
common
characteristics
of
an
inherent
nature
who
are
offered
special
protection
under
the
equal
protection
clauses
and
in
that
sense
that
is
the
first
part
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
understood
class-based
animus
to
be
and
those
who
are
aiding
the
former
to
secure
that
protection.
the
area,
i
think,
of
legitimate
dispute
is
what
is
one
to
make
of
the
repeated
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
interest
in
protecting
not
only
the
freedmen
but
republicans
and
northerners
and
others
who
were
also
the
object
of
the
klan.
in
the
legislative
materials
we
set
out,
both
in
our
opening
brief
and
at
pages
11
to
18
of
our
reply
brief,
it
seems
to
us
apparent
that
the
understanding
at
the
time
was
that
those
in
addition
to
the
freedmen
who
were
to
be
protected
were
the
individuals
who
were
seeking
to
assure
the
protections
to
that
group
of
americans
guaranteed
by
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments.
it
was
not
republicans
as
such.
it
was
not
the
northerners
as
such.
it
was
to
those
who
were
embarked
in
the
enterprise
of
making
those
amendments
real.
mr.
laurence
gold
the--
mr.
laurence
gold
--no.
we
would
think
that
the
comparable
situations
that
one
can
envisage
that
the
statute
would
extend
to
would
be
those
such
as
actions
against
japanese-americans
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
world
war
is
a
possibility,
but
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
had
any
intent
in
going
beyond
classes
that
are
defined
by
more
than
the
fact
that
people
are
doing
certain
things
which
other
people
do
not
like
and
therefore
are
set
upon.
indeed,
the
broadest
statement,
that
of
senator
edmunds,
which
is
relied
on,
and
it
is
wholly
unique
in
this
entire
legislative
history,
proposes
an
antithesis
between
feuds
which
are
generated
by
particular
activities
that
individuals
do
not
like
and
class-based
animus.
so
my
answer
to
your
question
would
be
that
the
weight
of
the
legislative
evidence
is
that
the
protection
extends
to
classes
of
inherent
characteristics
who
are
the
objects
of
discrimination
and
depravation--
mr.
laurence
gold
--under
this
court's
cases
in
the
development
of
fourteenth
amendment
law,
that
might
be.
again,
while
i
do
not
think
it
was
a
subject
of
interest,
immediate
interest
to
the
1871
congress,
women
could
be
such
a
class.
the
question
is
is
it
a
class
marked
by
an
inherent
characteristic--
mr.
laurence
gold
--right,
and
is
the
animus
against
either
the
people
of
that
class
or
those
who
were
assisting
members
of
that
class
to
enjoy
the
full
panoply
of
rights
stated
in
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments.
mr.
laurence
gold
if
it--
mr.
laurence
gold
--we
have
pondered
whether
that
case
throws
light
on
it,
and
in
a
sense--
mr.
laurence
gold
--we
are
not
sure.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
have
nothing
further
unless
there
are
questions.
