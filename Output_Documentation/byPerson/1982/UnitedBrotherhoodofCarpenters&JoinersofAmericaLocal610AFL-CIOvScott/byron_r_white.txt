what
did
it
deprive
them
of?
what
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
1985(3)
covers
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
griffin
have
gotten
to
the
thirteenth
amendment
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
always
have
to
have
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
again,
what
right
is
it?
what
is
it
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
1985(3)
covers
any
assault
that
is
performed
by
two
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
just
attacked
red-headed
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
not
think
there
is
any
necessity
for
the
conspiracy
to
interfere
with
the
efforts
of
the
state
to
protect
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
had
given
some
thought
to
it,
they
could
not
possibly
have
imagined
that
the
commerce
clause
would
authorize
this
kind
of
an
interference
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
as
of
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
the
question
is
construing
the
statute
they
read.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
purported
to
act
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
am
sure
they
thought
they
were
complying
with,
they
were
staying
within
its
limits.
if
you
say
the
limits
were
so
and
so,
those
are
the
limits
of
the
statute,
if
you
say
that
is
what
congress
intended.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
what
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
do
you
think
congress,
purporting
to
act
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
could
just
have
passed
a
murder
statute
of
general
applicability
all
over
the
country
on
the
theory
that
they
were...
do
you
think
that
would
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
right...
where
do
you
get
that
right
of
physical
security
under
the
federal
constitution
from
assault?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
private
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
suggest,
i
suppose,
that
the
federal
government
could
have
a
general
tort
law,
general
criminal
law
to
pick
up
all
the
crimes
around
if
they
involve
some
injury
to
person
and
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
were
conspiracies.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
is
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
you
are
pushing?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
defending
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
say
they
are
wrong.
you
just
do
not
want
to
defend
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
present
this
narrower
ground
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
not
necessary
to
make
it
except
that...
where
else
did
congress
get
the
authority
to
pass
this
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
this
group
of
people
at
this
site
had
the
right
not
just
to
associate,
and
maybe
you
are
saying
that,
too,
but
they
had
the
right
to
have
personal
security.
