mr.
gold,
why
would
a
plaintiff
or
group
of
plaintiffs
file
a
suit
under
section
1985(3)
instead
of
a
state
tort
action?
is
it
because
of
the
recovery
potentially
of
attorney's
fees
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
that
would
center
around
the
recovery
of
attorney's
fees
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
keith,
would
just
any
group
that
shared
common
political
or
social
beliefs
qualify
for
the
class
of
plaintiffs
that
you
would
see
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
to
define
the
class
we
look
in
the
minds
of
the
defendants
to
see--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the
women
thought
they
were
inferior?
