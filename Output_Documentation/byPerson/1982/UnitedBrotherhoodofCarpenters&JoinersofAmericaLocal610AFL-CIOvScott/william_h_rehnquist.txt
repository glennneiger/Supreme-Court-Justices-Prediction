justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
in
beaumont,
port
arthur
you
have
got
elected
judges
and
there
might
be
some
feeling
that
you
do
not
get
quite
the
same
neutrality
from
elected
judges
as
you
do
from
lifetime
federal
judges.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
think
of
any
more
rights,
mr.
gold,
that
would
fall
on
that
side
of
the
line
that
justice
stevens
drew?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
not
think
the
right
to
work
for
a
union
employer
stands
on
any
different
footing
than
the
right
to
work
for
a
non-union
employer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
what
if
say
up
in
vermont
the
natives
of
vermont
have
the
same
attitude
toward
democrats
that
many
southerners
at
that
time
had
towards
the
republicans.
do
you
think
that
if
a
democrat
went
up
to
vermont
and
was
set
upon
that
he
would
have
an
action
under
this
section?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nothing
to
do
with
freedmen,
obviously.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
keith,
how
do
you
get...
i
have
the
same
basic
question
mr.
justice
marshall
had.
how
do
you
get
deprived
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
by
private
individuals?
these
people
were
not
deprived
of
any
protection
of
the
law
that
i
can
see.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
want
to
get
back
to
the
fourteenth.
to
what
extent
are
you
relying
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
a
basis
for
congress'
enactment
of
this
statute
that
you
say
gives
you
a
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
what
is
the
authority
for
congress
to
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
congress
relied
on
the
commerce
clause
in
passing
1985?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
then
1983,
the
present--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
am
talking
about
1871.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
not
the
slightest
indication
from
the
legislative
debates
that
i
have
seen
in
1871
that
congress
gave
any
thought
to
the
commerce
clause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
is
basically
a
right
protected
by
the
federal
constitution,
the
right
to
security
or
respite
or
freedom
from
assault?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
everybody
is
getting
beaten
up?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
the
gist
of
the
thing
is
denying
your
clients
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
even
though
the
state
of
texas
apparently
is
perfectly
willing
to
enforce
the
law
against
everybody
evenhandedly.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there
is
really
no
state
action
involved
in
all.
