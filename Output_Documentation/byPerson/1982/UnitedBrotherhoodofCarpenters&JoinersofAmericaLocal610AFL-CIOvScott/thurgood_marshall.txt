--mr.
gold,
the
slaughterhouse
case
set
a
law
there,
did
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
nobody
pays
any
attention
to
it
any
more,
but
that
is
an
awful
clear
language
in
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
it
is
just
dead?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
might
breathe
some
life
in
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
counsel,
isn't
texas
a
right-to-work
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
trouble
with
your
argument
about
it,
so
well
organized
by
labor
unions.
justice
thurgood
marshall
eighty-five
three
says
equal
protection.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
so
you
will
claim
under
immunities?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
cannot
claim
equal
protection.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
is
the
state?
the
state
says
equal
protection.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
did
you
get
equal
protection
from
if
you
did
not
get
it
from
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
say
equal
protection
of
the
law--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and
the
only
place
you
find
that
in
the
constitution
is
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
took
it
from
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
left
the
state
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
just
took
the
equal
protection
and
left
the
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
keep
talking
about
economic
and
all.
i
thought
the
basis
of
these
statutes
were
the
black
codes
of
the
south,
the
black
codes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
tell
me
you
never
heard
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
not
the
reason
for
this
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
people
do
not
qualify
under
that,
do
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
'71?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
come
none
of
the
early
cases
mentioned
it?
i
mean,
the
earlier
decisions
of
this
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
two?
there
are
four
of
them
in
volume
100.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
one
volume.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
either
three
or
four.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
whole
point
is
you
have
got
a
clear
almost
undefendable
action
in
the
state
court.
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
going
to
have
a
dual
recovery
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
sir?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
going
to
drop
your
state
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
sir?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
there
were
two
involved
in
this
same
one.
i
am
talking
about
your
plaintiffs.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
you
could
have
brought
it
in
the
state
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
to
get
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
before,
why
the
federal
instead
of
the
state
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
was
easier.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case
if
they
had
not
said
this
is
union
country
or
if
they
had
not
said
anything
and
they
just
beat
him
up,
would
you
be
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
be
here?
i
mean,
do
you
think
so?
do
you
think
you
would
have
gotten
a
judgment
below?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
do
not
want
to
defend
the
court
below,
do
you
want
us
to?
well
who
is
here
defending
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
were.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
was
trying
to
keep
you
from
pulling
the
rug
out
from
under
yourself.
