would
illegitimates
be
such
a
class?

discrete,

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--mr.
keith,
under
your
view
would
a
private
men's
club
be
subject
to
a
1985(3)
suit
by
women?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
instead
of
women
suppose
it
is
blacks.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
they
are
just
denied--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--excluded
from
the
white
male
club.

the
original
purpose
i
gather...
animus
initially
was
in

the
freedmen,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--why
are
you
afraid
of
the
section
5
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
have
been
opinions
of
the
court
that
have
addressed
it,
as
you
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
still
do
not
understand
your
concern.
there
have
been
opinions
that
have
addressed
that
question
and
have
concluded
that,
indeed,
section
5
was
the
basis
upon
which
the
1871
act
was
adopted
in
united
states
v.
guest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
were
six
of
us
in
that
case
that
thought
so.
