i
have
a
question,
mr.
murdoch,
if
i
may.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
calculation
of
the
award
in
this
case
as
set
forth
in
the
red
brief,
on
page
17
they
explain
how
they
the
$275,000.
i
have
two
questions
that
i
just
didn't
understand.
did
they
not
subtract
from,
in
the
calculation,
the
future
payments
of
compensation
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not,
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
they
also...
if
they
subtracted
an
amount
for
the
minimum
wage,
why
wouldn't
they
also
subtract...
was
that
or
maybe
that
wasn't
raised?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
minimum
wage,
this
$66,000,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
minimum
he
would
have
earned
in
the
future.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
they
also
subtract
12
years
of
future
workmen's
compensation
payments?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
my
nest
question
is,
is
there
any
place
in
the
papers
a
calculation
similar
to
this
of
what
your
expert
or
what
your
position
in
the
trial
court
was
to
the
proper
award.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
did
not
offer
evidence
that
in
this
case
the
award
would
have
been
lower
under
your
theory,
how
do
you
have
standing...
i
don't
understand
whether
there
you
have
a
standing
to
claim
of
reversible
error
on
the
damages.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
offer
evidence
showing
what
that
would
have
produced?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
at
least
theoretically
possible
that
your
approach
would
have
produced
a
higher
damage
award
and
if
that
is
the
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--just
looking
at
the
record
in
this
case,
can
we
be
sure
that
you
would
have
been
better
off
under
your
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
know
whether
this
problem
of
how
to
compute
damages
in
an
inflationary
economy
has
ever
been
addressed
by
any
legislature?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question.
the
government
comes
up
with
two
proposals,
both
of
which
differ
from
the
total
offset
method.
am
i
correct
in
believing
that
both
of
those
which
do
in
a
sense
take
inflation
into
account...
both
of
those
represent
a
change
in
the
law
at
least
as
it
was,
let's
say,
ten
years
ago,
a
rather
dramatic
change
in
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
both
of
the
government
suggestions
do
factor
in
inflation
at
least
partially.
