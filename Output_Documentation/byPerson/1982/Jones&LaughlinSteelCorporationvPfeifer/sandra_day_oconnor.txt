that
would
be
traditional
in
those
workmen's
compensation
type
claims.
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
edmonds
case
which
seems
to
have
rejected
your
position,
and
in
this
limited
situation
would
say
that
the
ship
owner
is
still
liable
both
under
the
underlying
tort
claim
and
as
under
the
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
we
were
in
error
in
edmonds?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
was
a
pretty
clear
statement.
is
there
not
legislation
pending
in
congress
now
that
changed
this
precise--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
murdoch,
just
to
clarify
one
point.
you
never
contested
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
that
the
ship
owner
was
negligent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
for
our
purposes,
we
assume
that
there
was
negligence
as
a
vessel
owner;
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
otherwise
we
wouldn't
have
the
question--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
you
want
to
raise.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
i
am
assuming
that
we
must
assume
that
is
the
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
sg
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
on
the
damages
question
suggesting,
i
think
a
different
approach
than
you
are
suggesting
if
i
understand
it
correctly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
one
that
would
propose
that
perhaps
it's
all
right
to
consider
the
inflationary
factors,
both
as
applied
to
the
discount
element
and
as
applied
to
the
prospective
wage
increase.
but
suggesting
that
this
court
shouldn't
finally
determine
as
between
some
of
the
approaches
now
used
which
is
better.
