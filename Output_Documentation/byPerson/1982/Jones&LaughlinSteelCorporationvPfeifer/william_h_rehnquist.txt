justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
under
your
view,
you
start
with
the
reduction
of
the
award
to
present
value,
and
then
permit
it
to
be
augmented
by
testimony
as
to
increased
wages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
the
jury
ought
to
do
is
to
consider
that
testimony
as
to
future
earnings,
perhaps
higher
wage
rates
or
promotions
in
the
future.
then
after
they
get
the
total
award,
they
go
through
the
mechanics
of
reducing
it
to
present
value.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
burden
of
proof...
mr.
libenson,
isn't
the
burden
of
proof
as
to
the
amount
of
damages
he
is
entitled
to
recover
on
someone
in
mr.
pfeifer's
shoes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
granted
that
they
can't
rely
on
any
testimony
other
than
that
already
adduced.
but
supposing
your
expert
takes
the
stand
and
due
to
a
slip
of
communication
between
you
and
your
expert,
testifies
favorably
to
the
defendant.
the
fact
that
he
is
your
expert
doesn't
mean
that
the
defendant
can't
rely
on
his
testimony.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
return
to
your
waiver
point.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
after
precisely
the
same
testimony
as
was
adduced
here,
which
i
take
it
was
your
expert
on
the
question
of
damages--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--who
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
judge
cohill
had
then
said,
"i
don't
care
what
the
law
is
elsewhere,
i
think
inflation
is
20
percent
a
year.
"
"so
i
am
going
to
figure
a
factor
of
20
percent
a
year
on
the
basis
of
this
testimony.
"
and
made
his
award
accordingly.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
realize
that,
but
do
you
think
that
the
defendant
would
be
prevented
from
urging
on
appeal
that
judge
cohill
had
applied
the
wrong
measure
of
damages
simply
because
the
defendant--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
the
rule,
the
law
of
damages
doesn't
necessarily
depend
on
the
record.
it
is
a
body
of
law
that
you
find
in
cases
and
not
in
the
record
of
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
third
circuit
did
go
ahead
here
and
considered
various
rules
of
damages.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
third
circuit,
unless
i
wholly
misread
its
opinion,
affirmatively
adopted
a
rather
sweeping
change
in
the
law
of
damages
in
this
kind
of
case
at
least
for
that
circuit.
do
you
dispute
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
certainly
wasn't
a
rule
of
damages
applicable
to
only
these
particular
facts
and
only
this
particular
case.
it
laid
down
a
fairly
sweeping
rule,
whether
there
was
a
preceding
rule
or
not.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
discretionary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
may
have
been
discretionary,
but
they
exercised
their
discretion
to
adopt
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now
it
is
the
law
of
the
third
circuit.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
they
may
not
have
been
correct
in
doing
it,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
your
argument
about
waiver
really
has
little
bearing
in
view
of
what
the
third
circuit
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
libenson,
you
intimated
a
moment
ago
that
you
thought
the
third
circuit
was
reviewing
the
district
court's
damage
award
on
kind
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
theory.
taking
the
paragraph
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
15a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
continuing
over
that
paragraph
until
you
find
the
roman
five
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
do
you
think
that's
really
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
court
of
appeals'
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
a
fair
interpretation
to
say
that
all
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying
it
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
have
applied
this
rule,
intimating
that
perhaps
if
the
district
court
had
applied
another
rule,
it
would
have
affirmed
it,
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
he
felt
that
it
was
superior,
then
is
it
really
fair
to
say
that
it
is
a
review
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
basis,
and
that
if
judge
cohill
had
applied
any
one
of
five
or
six
other
rules,
you
think
that
would
have
been
affirmed,
too?
