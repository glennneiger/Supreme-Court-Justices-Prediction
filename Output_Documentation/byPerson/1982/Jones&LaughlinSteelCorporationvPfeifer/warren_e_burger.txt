chief

e.

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
jones
and
laughlin
steel
against
pfeifer.
mr.
murdoch,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
libenson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
rule,
the
yardstick
that
the
third
circuit
applied
is
not
warranted
and
justified,
what
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
just
a
matter
of
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
that
they
made
a
new
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
question
is
whether
made
the
correct
rule
of
law
on
measuring
damages,
is
it
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
they
made
the
correct
rule
of
law
to
measure
the
damages,
and
that
is
a
question
of
law
and
not
a
question
of
fact.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
what
facts
do
you
think
the
third
circuit
evolved,
to
use
your
term,
their
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
involve
an
assumption
that
inflation
is
always
going
to
remain
in
the
state
that
it
is
on
the
day
or
at
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
is
evolving
its
new
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
we
can
take
judicial
notice
that
it
has
been
decreasing
lately?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
has,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
it
not
gone
down?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
it
in
1980,
about
11
percent
or
12
percent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
a
separate
and
different
matter,
isn't?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
any
arguments
made
to
any
of
the
courts
along
the
line
that
something
like
a
cost
of
living
adjustment
could
be
built
into
an
award?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
resume
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel,
so
as
not
to
divide
your
rebuttal.
mr.
murdoch,
you
may
carry
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
ad
hoc
evaluations
could
be
appropriately
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
