mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
you
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
presents
two
questions
for
your
consideration.
the
first
question
being
the
interpretation
of
some
of
the
provisions
under
section
905(a),
905(b),
and
933
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
compensation
act.
the
second
question
is
a
question
regarding
major
damages
which
was
applied
by
the
lower
court
and
affirmed
by
the
third
circuit
in
this
particular
case.
by
way
of
background,
the
respondent
was
an
employee
of
jones
&
laughlin
steel
corporation.
he
had
worked
for
them
on
the
rivers,
particularly
on
the
monongahela
river
for
jones
&
laughlin
for
many
years.
he
was
entitled
as
having
the
duties
of
being
a
barge
helper
and
barge
handler.
in
doing
so,
he
would
go
out
and
he
would
work
with
the
barges.
so
that
you
are
aware
of
the
situation,
on
the
monongahela
river
jones
&
laughlin
had
two
landings.
the
first
landing
had
an
elevator
which
they
would
take
these
barges,
and
the
barges
being
approximately
175
feet
long,
26
feet
wide,
under
the
coal
elevator.
this
would
then
empty
the
barge
as
the
coal
goes
into
the
metal
freeze,
and
persons
like
mr.
pfeifer
would
then
be
in
charge
of
taking
care
of
the
fleet
as
the
empty
barges
would
be
moved
down
to
the
other
fleet.
mr.
pfeifer
was
injured
on
february
13,
1978,
at
which
time
he
came
out
to
work
on
the
midnight
shift.
he
did
not
work
his
normal
job
at
that
time,
his
normal
job
was
a
class
7
job,
but
as
he
would
do
from
time
to
time,
he
would
come
out
and
he
worked
as
a
headman,
this
was
a
class
13
as
far
as
the
pay
is
concerned.
in
that
position
mr.
pfeifer
was
in
charge
of
two
other
individuals
and
these
three
individuals
on
that
particular
shift
would
then
go
out
and
take
care
of
the
barges.
by
taking
care
of
the
barges,
they
would
make
sure
that
the
lashings
were
tight.
if
it
was
necessary
to
pump
out
any
barges
which
were
taking
on
water,
this
was
one
of
their
duties.
also
incumbent
upon
mr.
pfeifer
and
the
people
he
was
working
with
was
to
make
sure
that
the
gunnels,
which
would
be
the
walkways
on
the
barges,
and
the
deck-ends
where
the
people
would
walk
would
be
free
and
clear
of
snow.
as
i
say,
mr.
pfeifer
came
out
to
work
at
midnight
on
this
particular
shift,
and
sometime
later,
3:00
a.m.,
or
4:00
a.m.,
while
going
out
with
two
other
individuals
to
pump
a
barge,
he
slipped
on
some
ice
and
snow
that
had
been
accumulated
on
the
barge
and
injured
his
back.
as
a
result
of
that
incident,
then,
mr.
pfeifer
did
sign
the
proper
forms
for
getting
payments
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
compensation
act.
i
think
it
is
important
for
you
to
know
as
a
court
that
jones
&
laughlin
has
been
paying
mr.
pfeifer
for
the
compensation
benefits
as
called
for
under
this
act
ever
since
the
date
of
the
accident.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
in
this
particular
case
in
which
there
was
a
final
verdict
rendered
against
jones
&
laughlin
steel
corporation
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$275,000,
there
was
a
set
off
which
was
approximately
$33,000
for
the
compensation
benefits
which
had
been
made
to
mr.
pfeifer
as
of
the
date
of
the
trial.
i
believe
it
is
also
important
for
you
to
know
that
even
today
as
i
stand
here
arguing
this
case
before
you,
we
are
still
making
payments
under
the
compensation
act
as
called
for.
i
think
this
is
relatively
important
because
905(a)
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
act
sets
forth
what
we
refer
to
as
the
exclusivity
provision,
which
states
basically
that
a
person
injured
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
act
has
exclusive
remedies
to
receive
compensation
from
the
employer.
this
is
why
i
pointed
out
that
under
these
circumstances
we
have
been
and
in
fact
are
still
paying
because
as
jones
&
laughlin
looks
at
and
reviews
the
exclusivity
provision,
we
feel
that
that
is
the
only
basis
that
an
employee
is
to
receive
benefits
from
the
employer.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
i
think,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
--i
believe
you
are
in
error,
yes.
i
don't
believe
that
when
you
review
edmonds,
which
in
that
particular
instance
concerning
the
point
that
i
am
talking
to
you
about
today
was
strictly
dicta,
it
was
not
a
part
of
that
particular
case,
although
it
was
part
of
the
discussion.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
there
is
in
the
legislation
history
as
it
appears,
although
the
amendments
to
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
act
are
still
pending,
they
have
set
forth
the
case
of
griffith
versus
wheeling-pittsburgh
as
being
something
that
was
not
intended
from
the
1972
amendments.
i
will
give
you
some
background.
in
1972,
there
was
an
amendment
by
905(b),
which
is
the
section
that
was
discussed
in
edmonds
and
came
into
play.
as
i
look
at
the
edmonds
decision,
as
i
look
at
the
griffith/wheeling-pittsburgh
case,
i
feel
that
was
done
in
that
particular
instance,
though,
was
the
failure
to
look
at
sections
905(a),
905(b),
and
section
933,
as
they
are
all
read
together.
though
this
court,
even
as
recently
as
last
wednesday,
set
forth
in
the
case
of
lockheed
versus
the
united
states
that
905(a)
was
the
exclusive
remedy
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
benefit
act.
as
we
look
at
905(a),
it
simply
says
that
this
is
the
only
thing
that
the
employee
is
entitled
to.
getting
to
905(b)
and
looking
at
the
legislative
intent
of
the
amendments
back
in
1972,
as
we
have
in
most
workermen's
compensation
areas
you
had
the
quid
pro
quo.
you
had
the
giving
up
of
any
rights
that
they
might
have
had
before
the
amendments
to
sue
for
unseaworthiness
or
to
sue
for
indemnity
in
response
for
largely
increased
benefits.
these
benefits
are
taken
under
section
910
and
they
set
forth
that
as
of
june
1st
of
each
year
the
different
values
are
placed
on
as
to
what
the
increase
is
going
to
be
for
the
benefits,
and
then
they
are
implemented
in
october
of
that
particular
year.
so
the
position
that
we
have
here
is
that
because
of
the
1972
amendments
giving
such
a
large
increase
in
benefits
to
these
longshoremen
that
it
did
away
with
what
was
the
dual
capacity.
i
think
it
is
important
that
you
look
at
905(b)
as
it
applies
to
905(a)
and
933.
905(b)
basically
starts
off
by
saying
that
any
person
injured
under
this
particular
act
has
the
benefits
of
this
act.
i
stress
that
it
says
"any
person"
because
in
looking
at
the
edmonds
case
there
is
a
distinction
that
the
court
brought
or
the
court
intended
to
bring
up
by
saying
that
the
first
sentence
only
applies
to
a
longshoreman.
i
disagree
with
that
because
if
you
go
one
step
further,
it
says
in
905(b)
if
there
is
the
right,
then,
to
sue
the
vessel
or
vessel
as
a
person
that
the
employer
cannot
be
directly
or
indirectly
liable.
so
where
i
have
the
problem
with
edmonds
is
that
it
did
not
go
far
enough
with
the
language.
you
have
905(a)
which
basically
says
exclusively
you
get
the
benefits.
the
employer
is
not
to
suffer
any
more
manner
of
making
payments.
section
905(b)
reiterates
this,
it
says
that
the
employer
cannot
be
directly
or
indirectly
liable
to
the
injured
employee
on
behalf
of
the
vessel.
if
we
look
at
edmonds
and
we
try
to
determine
the
way
it
was
with
edmonds,
then
you
are
saying
basically
that
the
injured
employee
can
sue
the
vessel,
but
in
the
same
token
if
the
vessel
is
owned
by
the
employer
it
is
literally
the
employer
that
is
making
the
payments.
so
it
is
really
a
way
of
getting
around
the
language
as
far
as
what
905(a)
was,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
in
905(b),
as
the
second
part
of
the
first
sentence,
where
it
says
that
the
employer
may
not
be
directly
or
indirectly
liable
to
the
employee
for
the
vessel,
then
they
are
in
fact
reiterating
in
905(b)
the
exclusivity
provision
that
it
had
in
908(a).
going
one
step
further
in
that
same
sentence
in
section
905(b)
it
does
make
reference
that
if
any
action
can
be
filed
by
the
injured
employee,
it
would
be
in
accordance
with
section
933
of
the
same
act.
edmonds
did
not
address
itself
to
that
particular
section.
section
933
of
the
act
sets
forth
that
the
injured
employee,
if
he
determines
that
the
injuries
were
in
fact
caused
by
somebody
other
than
the
employer
or
an
employee
of
the
employer,
he
has
the
right
to
a
third
party
action.
so
i
think
you
have
in
905(a)
and
905(b)
and
933,
you
have
three
distinct
places
where
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
limit
any
payments
that
the
injured
employee
would
get
from
the
employer
to
solely
the
situation
of
receiving
the
compensation
benefits.
the
trade-offs,
as
i
have
indicated,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
intent
and
the
language
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief,
sets
forth
specifically
that
the
intent
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
act
was
to
place
maritime
workers
in
similar
situations
into
the
same
situation
that
a
land-based
employee
has
under
workmen's
compensation.
i
believe
the
court
is
well
aware
that
in
the
cases
where
we
have
a
state
workemen's
compensation
law
that
the
employee
who
is
injured
does
in
fact
have
the
right
to
get
the
benefits.
under
the
compensations
act,
he
had
no
other
benefits
at
that
time.
there
is
nothing
to
preclude
him,
as
i
feel
the
intent
of
905(b)
was,
to
sue,
let's
say,
the
manufacturer
of
a
machine
upon
which
he
was
injured
as
long
as
it
was
not
owned
by
the
employer.
so
i
think,
in
looking
at
the
1972
amendments,
when
you
put
them
all
together
without
taking
them
out
of
context,
that
you
can
see
that
the
overall
intent
was
simply
to
put
these
longshoremen
on
the
same
basis
of
land-based
employees,
to
get
only
that
type
of
benefit.
now,
905(b)
does
also
provide
that
somebody
who
is
injured,
who
is
not
an
employee
or
not,
can
sue
somebody
who
has
caused
the
injury,
but
again
if
there
is
any
liability
or
any
money
to
be
paid
by
the
employer,
then
they
are
not
going
to
receive
payments.
we
had
raised
this
contention
in
the
pleadings.
i
had
raised
it
as
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
lower
court,
and
of
course
the
third
circuit
looked
at
it,
but
this
is
the
first
time,
i
believe,
that
this
issue
has
been
before
this
court.
although
there
has
been
discussion
in
edmonds
and
in
other
cases,
i
do
feel
that
what
we
are
looking
at
is
a
situation
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
overwhelming
to
limit
the
recovery
that
the
longshoremen
could
get.
i
might
point
out
also
that
if
we
get
this
interpretation,
and
also
we
are
looking
at
minimizing
litigation
costs,
because
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
true
intent
then
the
employees
who
are
injured
will,
in
fact,
be
getting
their
compensation
benefits
which
are
quite
high
under
the
circumstances
of
this
act,
and
there
is
not
going
to
be
these
types
of
actions
which
are
going
to
take
up
the
time
of
the
trial
courts
largely.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
that
is
correct,
that
was
not
raised,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
that,
though,
that
the
finding
of
negligence,
if
you
want
to
look
at
a
dual
capacity,
was
not
made
clear
because,
although
it
was
a
finding
of
negligence
as
the
owner
pro
hac
vice,
it
did
not
make
a
distinction
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
finding
of
negligence
as
an
employer
or
as
a
vessel.
and
i
think
that
is
the
distinction
which
should
have
been
made.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
no,
i
don't
think
we
can
assume
that.
i
think
that
because
it
is
unclear
as
to
what
the
court
did,
perhaps
you
have
to
assume
that
in
order
to
determine
this
particular
question.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
i
am
sorry,
i
did
not
hear.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
on
the
particular
905(b)?
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
in
what
way,
i
don't
understand,
i'm
sorry,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
i
believe
the
issue
is
here.
i
believe,
as
i
stated
before
talking
with
justice
o'connor,
that
we
had
preserved
that
particular
point.
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
a
finding
of
negligence.
it
is
our
position
that
the
law
suit
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
be
filed
because
of
the
fact
that
mr.
pfeifer
was
the
employee.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
that
is
correct,
that
was
not
raised
at
the
time
of
the
argument.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
concerning
that
question,
i
will
go
on
to
the
second
question.
the
second
question
was
the
standard
of
the
measure
of
damages
which
was
decided
by
the
lower
court
and
then
affirmed
by
the
third
circuit.
in
1980,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
decided
the
case
of
kacskowski
versus
bolubasc
and
in
that
particular
case
they
had
adopted
what
had
been
known
as
the
alaska
rule,
which
is
basically
the
total
offset
method.
in
the
total
offset
method,
the
lower
court
assumed
that
any
inflation
which
may
arise
in
the
future
would
be
the
equivalent
and
be
offset
of
any
interest
rates,
so
that
rather
than
discounting
to
the
present
value,
that
whatever
the
value
of
lost
future
earnings
were
going
to
be
or
the
capacity
of
future
earnings,
that
was
what
the
measure
was.
in
this
particular
case,
as
i
stated
before,
the
lower
court
came
to
the
conclusion
based
on
a
worklife
of
12
years
that
mr.
pfeifer
would
have
been
making
$26,000
for
those
12
years.
in
multiplying
this
there
was
a
finding
that
mr.
pfeifer
could
do
some
minimum
wage,
so
that
was
projected
over
the
worklife
expectancy
and
that
was
deducted
in
addition
to
the
workmen's
or
longshoremen's
compensation
benefits
that
we
had
paid
as
of
the
date
of
the
jury...
the
non-jury
verdict,
that
was
deducted.
it
is
our
position,
as
we
told
the
lower
court
and
put
in
our
post-findings
of
fact,
that
it
was
going
to
be
necessary...
in
the
event
that
there
was
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
that
there
was
going
to
have
to
be
a
reduction
to
present
work.
this
was
not
done
as
it
was
just
assumed,
as
i
state,
that
the
inflation
was
going
to
offset
the
interest
rates
and,
therefore,
whatever
the
figure
determined
at
that
time
was
was
going
to
be
what
the
plaintiff
would
get.
we
submit
to
this
honorable
court
that
this
is
a
decision
upon
which
there
is
really
no
basis
to
make
this
type
of
finding.
i
think
when
we
look
at
the
purpose
of
determining
why
we
give
a
lump
sum
award,
it
is
because
the
lump
sum
award,
if
it
is
given
directly
to
the
plaintiff
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
is
going
to
be
worth
much
more
after
investing
than
it
would
be
by
the
reduction
to
present
value,
which
is
what
this
court
set
the
standard
to
be
in
1916
in
the
case
of
chesapeake
versus
kelly.
also
as
recently
as
1980
in
the
case
of
lifeco
there
was
the
same
reiteration
that
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
full
value,
a
fair
figure
for
impairment
of
future
earnings
or
lost
wages
there
must
be
a
reduction
of
present
worth.
that
was
ignored
by
the
third
circuit
and
this
is
the
only
circuit
which
has
adopted
this
measure
of
damages
in
a
federal
action,
and
we
submit
that
it
should
not
be
done
so.
there
have
been
many
cases
set
forth
in
our
brief,
and
also
in
the
briefs
of
the
amicus
which
have
filed
on
our
behalf,
setting
forth
the
problems
that
even
economists
have
with
making
a
determination
as
to
how
to
determine
if
in
fact
we
are
going
to
have
inflation
and
be
able
to
project
inflation
at
a
particular
rate
over
a
long
time
period.
i
think
with
that
we
have
seen
in
the
economy
in
the
last
three,
four,
five
years
with
the
spiraling
inflation
rates,
with
the
governmental
steps
to
come
in
and
try
to
reduce
inflation,
with
determining
whether
or
not
we
are
in
a
recession
or
a
depression,
with
all
the
economic
factors,
the
economists
cannot
even
agree
from
past
events
what
caused
those.
it
has
been
held
almost
uniformly,
although
there
are
some
circuits
which
are
making
a
distinction,
that
inflation
is
too
speculative
to
have
somebody
come
in
and
make
a
argument,
give
evidence
to
a
fact-finder,
to
project
over
a
long
time
period.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
proper
measure
of
damages
would
be
to
get
back
to
what
we
still
call
the
traditional
approach.
the
traditional
approach
being
that
there
can
be
evidence
of
a
particular
category
of
individuals
in
a
particular
geographical
area,
and
there
can
be
testimony
of
somebody
to
come
in
as
an
economist
to
set
forth
that
there
would
be
a
likelihood
of
increased
wages,
but
not
to
get
into
the
convoluted
type
of
testimony
that
we
have
with
inflation.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
i
think
we
would
do
it
sort
of
backwards,
justice
rehnquist.
we
would
have
the
testimony
as
to
merit
increases,
productivity
increases.
the
fact
for
the
particular
occupation
that
the
plaintiff
is
involved
in
that
there
would
be
the
likelihood
of
increase
of
wages.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
we
think
this
is
the
most
fair
because,
i
think
as
litigators
and
being
in
and
out
of
courts,
one
of
the
things
we
want
to
do
is
to
try
to
get
the
type
of
testimony
which
is
not
going
to
be
convoluted,
which
is
not
going
to
increase
the
time
of
trial,
the
cost
of
trial,
and
also
put
it
on
the
basis
that
some
fact-finders
or
jurors
can
then
make
a
decision
as
to
what
they
should
give
a
person
who
is
injured.
i
think
this
is
fair
because
one
of
the
things
that
we
strive
to
do
in
courts
is
to
make
it
a
system
that
is
fair
not
only
for
the
defendants
but
for
the
plaintiffs.
the
history
has
shown
that
any
increase
in
inflation
has
not
kept
up
with
any
increase
as
far
as
interest
rates
are
concerned.
you
have
problems
if
you
project,
such
as
in
kaczkowski,
the
inflation,
basically
the
inflation,
because
you
are
going
to
assume
then
that
even
the
increases
of
salary
are
going
to
keep
up
with
rates
of
inflation.
i
think
that
the
past
history
has
shown
in
the
cases
that
we
have
cited,
and
that
the
amici
have
cited,
that
this
just
is
not
so.
what
i
am
suggesting,
as
i
said,
we
want
to
preclude
the
introduction
of
speculation
which
is
basically,
as
i
say,
convoluted,
reduce
it
to
present
worth.
you
have
a
built-in
factor
there
that
if
interest
rates
are
going
to
increase
that
the
increase,
then,
from
the
interest
rates
can
be
reinvested
and
this
would
also
benefit
the
plaintiff.
so
i
am
not
looking
at
a
situation
where
we
are
trying
to
cut
down
as
far
as
what
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
get,
but
to
make
it
something
that
is
workable
for
the
court
system,
fair
to
both
parties,
and
still
something
that
can
cut
down
on
the
litigation
costs.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
as
far
as
what
they
have
suggested,
they
were
talking
specifically
about
what
would
be
the
feldman
case
and
the
doca
case
where
they
had
an
adjusted
discount
rate.
i
am
not
so
sure
that
they
really
did
apply
inflationary
and
non-inflationary
matters
before
they
applied
the
discount
rate
at
that
time.
one
of
the
problems
i
have
with
their
approaches
is
that
they
do
assume,
in
fact,
that
the
wages
of
those
particular
plaintiffs
lost,
or
their
earning
capacity
in
the
future,
would
have
in
fact
kept
rate,
would
have
increased
with
inflation.
i
don't
think
that
they
can
do
that.
what
i
am
suggesting
is,
i
think,
a
better
situation
because
if
you
look
at
the
feldman
case,
they
had
1.5
percent
discount
rate.
doca
had
a
2
percent
discount
rate.
but
i
believe
in
the
doca
case,
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
said,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
it
be
this
2
percent,
it
might
be
3
percent
or
it
might
be
4
percent.
there
are
other
approaches
set
forth
in
the
other
briefs
which
were
filed
on
our
behalf.
i
do
think
that
the
discussion
does
show
that
the
inflation
factor
should
not
be
part
of
the
testimony.
i
think
that
this
court
should
look
at
the
vitality
of
kelly
and
reaffirm
it
in
light
of
this
particular
question.
what
i
would
concerned
about
is
that,
as
we
look
at
the
uniformity
provision
of
one
and
the
same
type
of
standards
to
look
at
in
all
the
circuits,
that
this
honorable
court
is
certainly
going
to
have
to
make
some
determination
as
to
what
guidelines
would
be.
at
most,
we
would
suggest
that
the
koczkowski
case,
or
the
total
offset
method
which
was
adopted
in
this
case,
be
overturned
because
there
is
no
precedent
for
it,
there
is
no
evidence
for
it.
i
think
it
is
improper.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve--
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
no,
they
didn't.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
the
$33,000
which
is
subtracted
there
was
the
compensation
payments
we
had
made
from
the
date
of
injury--
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
--to
the
date
of
trial.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
i
am
sorry.
the
minimum
wage,
justice
stevens,
which
was
$66,000.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
then
the
$33,000.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
over
the
12
years,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
what
the
court
indicated
was
going
to
happen
was
that
if
in
fact
there
was
going
to
be
an
appeal
at
the
time
there
was
a
final
decision
in
this
case,
that
we
would
then
make
a
determination
as
to
what
had
been
paid
at
that
time.
what
happens
from
a
practical
standpoint
is
that
if
a
lump
sum
award
is
going
to
be
given
to
mr.
pfeifer,
no
further
payments
are
made
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
we
are
given
credit
for
that.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
no,
there
was
not
much
evidence
on
that,
justice
stevens.
we
did
not
have
an
expert
witness
per
se.
we
had
somebody
from
the
payroll
office,
who
is
high
up
in
the
payroll
office,
who
came
and
talked
about
it,
but
we
did
not
project
anything.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
we
argued
at
the
time,
not
only
in
proposed
findings
of
fact
but
during
the
trial,
that
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
proper
decision
as
to
any
damages
which
were
going
to
be
awarded
that
there
would
have
to
be
the
reduction
to
present
worth.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
no,
we
didn't.
we
felt
that
that
was
the
burden
of
the
plaintiff.
we
felt
that
if
the
court
would
come
in
and
apply
what
we
felt
was
the
proper
standard
of
damages.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
i
don't
believe
so
because
traditionally
in
pennsylvania
there
has
been
a
reduction
to
6
percent.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
you
have
nothing
in
the
record
before
you
on
that.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
thank
you,
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
cover
several
points
which
were
raised
in
mr.
libenson's
argument.
i
would
respectfully
disagree
that
by
having
the
amendments
of
1972
that
the
reed
versus
the
yakka
case
was
overruled.
i
feel
that
if
in
my
interpretation,
putting
905(a),
905(b),
and
933
together,
would
indicate
again,
without
getting
back
into
my
argument,
that
all
actions
against
a
vessel
or
an
employer
are
completely
devoid
due
to
these
amendments
and,
therefore,
i
feel
the
negligence
actions
which
are
allowed
under
905(b)
are
for
a
longshoreman
or
anyone
covered
under
the
act
against
somebody
other
than
the
employer.
as
to
the
payments
that
come
under
the
workmen's
compensation
benefits,
such
as
we
have
in
this
case,
i
believe
that
one
of
the
intents,
one
of
the
purposes
that
we
have
in
the
workmen's
compensation
statute
was
to
provide
regular
payments
to
the
individual
who
was
injured.
we
have
two
dangers
if
this
type
of
action
is
allowed.
first
of
all,
it
requires
a
lump
sum
payment,
which
is
going
to
be
paid
with
the
stopping
of
the
compensation
payments.
there
is
no
guarantee
that
anybody
who
receives
a
lump
sum
payment
such
as
this
is
going
to
retain
it
or
have
the
wise
investment
opportunities.
so
i
think
that
it
is
something
that
should
be
considered,
with
the
purpose
to
allow
the
monetary
benefits
on
a
regular
basis,
that
these
types
of
actions
go
against
that
particular
intent.
mr.
robert
w.
murdoch
yes,
i
believe
they
could.
as
to
the
total
offset
method,
i
would
like
to
raise
something
as
an
example
in
order
to
show
exactly
what
we
are
involved
with
with
the
total
offset
method.
if
we
assume
that
the
finding
of
the
court
would
be
that
the
lost
earning
capacity
in
the
future
would
be
$180,000
for
that
particular
plaintiff,
what
the
total
offset
method
does
is
provide
$180,000
in
that
individual's
pocket
at
that
time.
it
allows
him
to
invest
at
the
rates,
to
reinvest
at
higher
rates,
so
that
assuming
that
he
had
ten
years
of
lost
productivity,
he
gets
$180,000
plus
all
the
total
interest
over
that
time
period.
that
is
not
what
we
are
attempting
to
do
when
we
are
determining
what
amount
of
money
is
due
to
an
injured
individual.
we
are
determining
that
if
he,
in
fact,
is
going
to
lose
$180,000
over
his
worklife
expectancy,
that
by
reducing
to
the
present
value
that
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
year
in
my
example
of
his
worklife
expectancy,
he
is
going
to
receive
exactly
what
he
would
have
received
had
he
been
continuing
to
work.
the
total
offset
method
does
not
do
that.
it
goes
completely
against
the
grain
to
the
prejudice
of
the
defendants.
also
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
under
section
905(a)
and
905(b)
that
it
is
almost
a
strict
liability
situation
as
far
as
the
employer
is
concerned.
we
are
required
as
employers
to
make
these
payments
whether
there
is
negligence,
non-negligence,
or
anything
like
that.
i
think
that
this
should
be
taken
into
consideration.
thank
you
very
much.
