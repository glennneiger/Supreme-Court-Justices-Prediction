mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case.
the
first
is
whether
a
longshoreman
may
sue
his
employer
for
negligence
as
a
vessel
owner
under
905(b)
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
compensation
act.
i
will
refer
to
this
as
the
act
as
i
go
through
my
argument.
the
second
is
whether
the
lower
court
properly
calculated
damages
on
the
record
before
it.
both
these
issues
were
affirmed
in
the
lower
court
in
favor
of
my
client,
the
respondent.
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
compensation
act
was
passed
in
1927,
but
it
was
significantly
amended
in
1972
to
add
905(b)
for
the
first
time.
905(b)
put
into
statutory
form
permission
to
bring
an
action
against
a
vessel
as
a
third
party
in
negligence
instead
of
unseaworthiness
which
was
the
previous
method
of
claim.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
the
petitioner,
j&l's
negligence
in
its
ownership
capacity
is
not
before
this
court.
furthermore,
j&l
admitted
that
it
was
owner
pro
hac
vice
of
all
the
barges
in
the
fleet
on
january
13,
1978,
when
howard
pfeifer
was
injured,
when
he
slipped
on
an
accumulation
of
snow
and
ice
on
a
gunnel.
i
don't
know
if
the
court
is
familiar
with
how
barges
are
assembled
on
the
allegheny
river.
these
are
coal
barges
and
they
are
assembled
and
lashed
together
in
what
they
call
a
fleet.
the
barges
are
moved
in
or
out
of
the
fleet
to
unload
or
load
coal
to
the
steel
mill.
the
point
is
that
of
the
35
barges
that
were
there
that
night
or
40
barges,
the
ownership
of
those
were
all
j&l's
under
the
pro
hac
vice
theory,
whether
or
not
they
actually
did
own
them
or
not.
however,
j&l
would
have
you
treat
this
case
differently
if
my
client
fell
on
an
unowned
barge
in
the
same
fleet,
which
is
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
act.
under
905(b)
all
longshoremen
are
to
be
treated
the
same,
and
there
should
be
no
difference
whether
the
vessel
is
employer-owned
or
third
party-owned.
the
fact
is
that
the
employer
assumes
a
dual
capacity
as
all
circuit
courts
have
found
of
ownership
of
the
vessel.
they
don't
have
to
do
this,
but
when
they
do
it,
the
act
applies
to
them
as
it
would
apply
to
any
other
vessel
owner.
the
incidence
of
their
being
an
employer
of
the
person
who
is
injured
is
incidental
to
the
fact
of
their
ownership
of
the
vessel.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
award
in
this
case
should
not
depend
on
the
gratuitous
event
or
happenstance
of
how
or
where
a
person
happens
to
fall
if
he
is
going
to
be
injured.
the
1972
amendments
to
this
act
were
brought
about
because
of
this
court's
finding
in
seas
shipping
against
sieracki
and
in
the
lyon
case.
during
the
period
between
1927
and
1972,
the
practice
was
for
a
vessel
to
ask
for
an
indemnity
agreement
from
any
stevedore
company,
and
the
effect
was
that
any
injury
or
claim
against
the
vessel
under
unseaworthiness
was
paid
finally
by
the
stevedore
company
under
the
indemnity
agreement.
congress
felt
that
this
was
improper.
in
passing
the
amendments
in
1972,
it
took
away
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine,
the
indemnity
provisions,
and
it
expanded
the
act
by
increasing
the
benefits.
but
it
also
in
effect
ratified
reed
against
the
yakka
and
jackson
which
this
court
had
passed,
and
permitted
a
suit
against
the
vessel
itself
under
905(b).
this
court
in
edmonds,
speaking
through
justice
white,
considered
905(b)
and
stated.
"to
permit
a
third
party
suit
against
the
vessel
providing
its
own
loading
and
unloading
services
where
negligence
and
its
stevedoring
capacity
contributes
to
the
injury.
"
the
second
sentence
means
no
more
than
that
all
longshoremen
are
to
be
treated
the
same,
whether
their
employer
is
an
independent
stevedore
or
a
shipowner
stevedore.
all
stevedores
are
to
be
treated
the
same
whether
they
are
independent
or
an
arm
of
the
shipowner
itself.
justice
white
further
cited
the
congressional
hearing
reports
and
stated
in
footnote
12
in
his
opinion
that
"congress
ultimately
decided
to
preserve
the
longshoremen's
tort
action
against
shipowners
acting
as
shipowners.
"
the
legislative
goal
of
passing
905(b)
was
the
safety
of
the
longshoremen,
and
the
committee
reports
say
that
"the
committee
recognized
the
progress
that
has
been
made
in
reducing
injury
in
the
longshoring
industry,
but
longshoring
remains
one
of
the
most
hazardous
types
of
occupation,
and
the
committee
expects
to
see
further
progress
in
reducing
injuries
and
stands
ready
to
immediately
reexamine
the
third
party
question.
"
the
point
is
that
congress
felt
that
by
preserving
the
action
against
the
vessel,
it
would
have
a
salutary
effect
on
the
vessels
to
ensure
their
safety.
there
are
six
circuit
courts
that
have
addressed
this
question
since
the
1972
amendments
have
been
in
effect,
and
all
of
them
have
arrived
at
a
finding
that
is
in
conformity
with
griffith
and
the
results
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
this
court,
speaking
through
justice
powell
in
pfeifer,
stated
that
this
was
a
remedial
statute,
and
the
amendments
were
made
out
of
solicitude
for
the
workers.
justice
o'connor
very
recently,
since
the
filing
of
our
brief,
in
director
against
perrini,
cited
the
committee
reports
for
authority
as
to
what
the
act
meant.
i
think
if
this
court
will
again
refer
to
the
act
and
committee
reports,
they
should
have
no
problem
with
905(b).
congress's
intent
was
to
treat
all
longshoremen
alike,
whether
employed
by
an
independent
stevedore
or
shipowner
stevedore
and
to
impose
liability
on
shipowner
stevedores
for
negligence
in
their
ownership
capacity.
this
comports
with
the
legislative
intent
of
encouraging
safety
on
vessel
and
holding
an
employer/owner
to
the
same
standards
as
any
other
shipowner
when
acting
in
its
shipowner
capacity.
to
deny
pfeifer's
recovery
due
to
the
mere
happenstance
of
his
being
injured
on
an
employer-owned
or
pro
hac
vice
vessel
would
be
grossly
unfair
and
contrary
to
the
legislative
intent,
and
to
circuit
cases.
it
would
remove
any
incentive
to
shipowner/employers
to
exercise
due
care
in
their
ownership
capacity
in
this
case.
i
would
also
point
out
to
this
court
that
there
is
no
double
recovery.
as
justice
stevens
asked
and
was
advised,
the
award
in
this
case
is
deducted
from
the...
the
compensation
in
this
case
is
deducted
from
the
award,
so
there
is
no
double
recovery.
the
employer
is
repaid
any
payments
it
makes
under
the
compensation.
jones
&
laughlin
undertook
ownership
responsibilities
and
failed
to
live
up
to
its
responsibilities
and
it
must,
therefore,
be
held
liable
in
negligence
for
the
injuries
to
my
client
under
905(b).
the
question
of
damages
and
the
proper
method
of
determining
damages
is
also
before
this
court.
first
of
all,
i
would
point
to
the
court,
as
justice
stevens
has
asked,
there
is
a
complete
waiver
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
to
raise
this
question.
the
local
rules
of
the
district
court
in
which
this
was
tried
require
any
expert
testimony
to
be
proffered
in
the
pretrial
statement
with
a
report
from
the
expert,
and
before
an
expert
is
permitted
to
testify.
there
was
no
report
filed
by
the
petitioner
nor
any
evidence
offered
on
his
behalf.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
the
initial
burden,
but
if
they
were
going
to
contest
the
award,
they
have
to
offer
their
own
evidence,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
i
agree.
but
in
our
case,
we
offered
in
the
known
wages,
and
we
put
in
the
wages
of
the
men
above
and
below
my
man
in
seniority
to
show
what
he
would
have
earned
over
the
period
of
time
up
to
the
time
of
trial.
in
addition,
we
offered
into
evidence
the
known
union
contract
which
had
had
certain
increases
in
it,
i
think
through
1982,
although
the
trial,
i
think,
was
in
1979
or
1980.
judge
cohill
in
the
district
court
decided,
after
looking
at
this
case,
that
there
was
no
federal
common
law.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
okay.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
we
had
no
expert,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
there
was
no
expert.
we
just
put
in
the
wages,
the
wage
losses,
and
we
were
satisfied
to
proceed
with
that.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
he
didn't
do
that.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
you
are
presupposing,
justice
rehnquist,
that
he
went
outside
the
record
which
he
did
not
do,
and
that
is
my
point.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
i
would
like
to...
if
i
could
answer
your
question
by
directing
your
attention
or
inviting
your
attention
to
the
alma
case
against
manufacturers
hanover
trust
in
the
ninth
circuit,
which
stated
that
in
the
absence
of
evidence
on
the
reduction
by
either
side,
the
court
is
not
obligated
to
go
ahead
sua
sponte
to
do
it.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
i
think
the
third
circuit
did
essentially
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
in
alma,
it
addressed
the
record
in
front
of
it
and
what
it
did
was
say
that
whether
or
not
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
worker's
compensation
act
considered
inflation
and
whether
or
not
there
was
federal
law
as
precedent
at
that
time.
my
point
is
that
the
act
itself,
unlike
the
shoremen
act,
does
not
have
a
treble
damage
requirement.
it
has
no
requirement
as
to
damages.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
i
don't
dispute
it
but
i
think
the
answer
is
that
there
was
no
law
of
damages
in
a
fixed
manner
at
that
time.
what
the
third
circuit
did
was
evolve,
if
you
will,
federal
common
law
like
any
other
common
law
that
is
evolved.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
i
think
it
was
discretionary.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
for
the
third
circuit
to
adopt
the
kaczkowski
case
and
a
total
offset.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
that
is
true,
but
i
think
there
was
room
for
it
because
there
was
nothing
in
the
federal
law
at
that
time
that
directed
them
any
other
way.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
my
argument...
the
waiver
goes
to
the
fact
that
i
don't
think
the
petitioner
can
ask
for
a
reduction
to
present
worth
at
this
point
in
time
because
it
is
not
in
the
record,
that
is
my
point,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
if
they
had
other
evidence
before
it
from
which
they
could
argue
but
to
say
that
it
is
not
warranted--
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
--that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
i
don't
think
they
were
entitled
to
make
a
new
rule
under
the
state
of
the
law
as
it
was
before
them
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
presented
to
them.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
they
took
the
case,
your
honor...
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
that
is
true,
but
a
law
evolves
from
facts
and
i
think
a
court
has
to
have
facts
in
front
of
it
before
it
can
make
law.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
all
right.
i
think
they
utilized
the
unique
situation
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
precedent
governing
federal
law
of
damages,
other
than
chesapeake
and
ohio.
the
case...
the
pfeifer
case
in
the
third
circuit
opinion
comports
with
chesapeake
and
ohio
against
kelly,
a
1916
case,
because
the
set
off
of
inflation
against
reduction
to
present
worth
in
effect
is
a
reduction.
that
is
what
the
third
circuit
said,
and
the
third
circuit
also
said
that
this
case,
in
their
opinion,
conforms
to
chesapeake
and
ohio
against
kelly.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
i
think
that
the
history
of
inflation
is
recognized
by
all
circuits
at
this
point,
but
the
first.
i
think
that
everyone
on
this
bench
knows
that
inflation
has
been
present
since
at
least
1950
and
has
been
increasing.
it
is
a
problem
that
has
to
be
considered.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
that
is
one
of
the
problems
in
the
case.
i
think
that
you
probably
will
or
could.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
pardon.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
yes,
but
it
is
a
variable
thing.
you
see
in
the
newspapers
it
changes
every
day.
but
this
case
was
tried
in
1980,
and
we
are
in
front
of
you
in
1983.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
it
was
runaway
inflation
at
that
time,
that
is
right.
the
defendant
was
probably
getting
18
percent
on
the
verdict
here
that
they
have
been
appealing
while
the
plaintiff
got
nothing.
the
plaintiff
only
gets
6
percent
if
he
collects
on
the
verdict
anyway.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
it
is
a
different
issue,
but
i
think
it
illustrates
the
problem,
your
honor.
but
also,
i
think,
the
court
should
consider
that
when
inflation
decreases,
interest
rates
go
down,
too.
so
the
concept
of
the
total
offset
method
has
many
good
features.
it
is
predictable.
it
is
precise.
it
is
inexpensive,
and
it
saves
court
time.
bringing
experts
in
the
court
can
change
an
argument,
or
a
trial,
rather,
to
a
trial
within
a
trial,
and
many
cases
totally
confuses
the
jury.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
this
point
in
time,
i
think
between
the
various
circuits
that
have
considered
it,
you
have
possibly
four
different
concepts.
you
have
cases,
in
doca,
in
feldman,
or
o'shea,
where
the
various
courts
have
said
that
there
is
a
real
rate
of
interest
which
is
anywhere
from
1.5
to
2
to
3
percent.
there
is
a
series
of
cases
where
the
court
just
lets
it
to
the
jury
to
consider
what
inflation
is.
there
is
a
series
of
cases
that
requires
expert
testimony.
then
there
is
the
total
offset
method.
all
four
wrestle
with
the
same
problem
as
to
what
is
the
method,
but
i
think
they
illustrate
that
any
one
method
is
just
not
exclusive.
i
think
that
this
court,
if
it
attempted
to
say
that
there
is
one
method
that
is
superior
to
the
others,
would
only
run
into
additional
problems
on
other
aspects
of
damages
that
would
not
hold
water.
the
only
question
that
the
third
circuit
really
answered
in
its
opinion
was
that
they
held
that
the
district
court
did
not
err
in
computing
damages
for
future
loss
of
earnings...
this
is
on
16a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari...
because
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
through
the
process
of
discounting
lump
sum
awards
at
theoretical
present
values.
the
discount
factor
is
presumed
equal
to
the
offset
by
the
impact
of
inflation
on
the
future
economic
value
of
the
award.
i
submit
that
the
total
offset
method
is
as
good
as
others
and
better
from
a
theoretical
standpoint.
it
is
efficient,
predictable,
and
saves
court
time.
justice
o'connor,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
1982
congressional
hearings
on
amending
the
longshoremen
act,
at
page
32,
congress
said:
"however,
apart
from
these
limitations
on
owner
vessel...
limitations,
an
owner
vessel
would
not
be
relieved
of
liability
for
owner
occasioned
negligence.
"
and
cites
lundy
against
litton,
smith
against
eastern
seaboard,
and
griffith.
i
submit
that
congress
has
no
intention
in
1982
of
overruling
the
griffith
case
which
this
case
follows.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
your
question
again,
is
this
a
fair
interpretation?
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
i
think
so.
but
i
think
that
judge
aldisert
in
writing
this
opinion
felt
that
inflation
had
to
be
addressed,
obviously,
from
the
contents
of
the
opinion,
and
he
felt
that
this
method,
if
it
is
going
to
be
addressed,
is
superior
to
anything
else
that
has
been
utilized
in
the
various
circuits.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
i
think
so.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
i
am
not
aware
of
any,
justice
stevens.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
your
honor,
in
the
record
in
this
case,
cost
of
living
increases
were
submitted
to
the
district
court
that
were
known
under
the
various...
under
the
union
contract,
however;
and
that
is
the
reason,
on
page
21
of
my
brief,
i
was
able
to
demonstrate
that
if
you
add
in
the
cost
of
living
increases
that
were
known
up
to
the
time
of
the
trial
and
then
reduce
them
by
the
2
percent
method
under
the
doca
case,
you
would
still
come
up
with
about
an
$80,000
higher
verdict
than
was
obtained
in
this
case.
judge
cohill
felt
that
the
kaczkowski
case
or
the
alaska
rule
of
total
offset
was
appropriate
and
he
applied
it
in
this
case.
i
hope
that
answers
your
question.
0....
i
think
this
court
did
address
inflation
in
leipheld
and
it
said
again
future
inflation
are
matters
of
estimate
and
prediction,
but
estimate
and
prediction
is
not
anything
precise.
the
problem
is
if
the
court
is
looking
for
a
precise
and
totally
accurate
damage
award,
i
just
don't
think
they
exist.
i
think
the
question
is,
if
you
are
looking
for
a
method
that
is
appropriate
for
most
cases
and
which
should
be
followed,
i
commend
the
total
offset
method
to
you
because,
again,
it
is
comprehensible,
efficient,
and
inexpensive.
it
will
save
court
time.
you
will
avoid
the
necessity
of
expert
witnesses.
i
think
any
of
you
justices,
who
have
tried
cases
with
expert
witnesses
on
both
sides,
you
do
not
get
a
consensus
or
an
agreement.
it
is
something
for
a
jury
to
have
to
decide
who
to
believe
anyway.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
i
think
the
question
of
inflation
itself
represents
the
change.
the
question
of
how
to
factor
it
in
is
the
problem.
the
method
is,
we
could--
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
--yes.
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
i
think
all
the
circuit
courts,
but
the
first,
at
this
time,
consider
inflation
in
awards.
but
the
real
question
is:
what
is
the
most
efficient
way
of
doing
in
the
first
place.
mr.
jerome
m.
libenson
i
might
add
that
the
total
offset
method,
if
it
does
favor
a
plaintiff
in
a
very
small
degree,
it
should
because
the
plaintiff
is
not
the
culpable
party,
at
that
point
he
has
already
established
his
liability.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
pfeifer's
cause
of
action
against
the
vessel
owned
or
controlled
by
his
employer
j&l
is
valid.
the
damages
were
properly
calculated
in
accordance
with
federal
law.
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
must
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
