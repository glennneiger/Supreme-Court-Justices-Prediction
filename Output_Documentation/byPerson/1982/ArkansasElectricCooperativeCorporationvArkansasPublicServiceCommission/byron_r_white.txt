do
you
think
the
state
court
rejected
your

justice

to
reach
its
result
it
had
to
reject
your
rea
submission.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
needs
to
have
been...
at
least,
it
needs
to
have
been
presented
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state
before
we
have
even
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
early
enough.
was
it
raised...
did
you
say
it
was
raised
in
the
initial
briefs
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
about
the
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
sure
we
have
jurisdiction
to
reach
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
attleboro
wouldn't
just
automatically
apply
to
any
wholesale
sale;
it
would
have
to
be
a
wholesale
sale
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
this
generating
facility
generated
its
own
power
and
delivered
it
over
its
own
lines
to
local
coops
within
the
single
state,
i
wouldn't
think...
you
wouldn't
be
here
arguing
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
10
percent
that
is
delivered
directly
to
customers
within
the
state
from
a
generating
facility
of
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
see.
none
of
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--none
of
it
is
delivered
directly.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
take
it
you
say
there's
still
a
gap,
then.
there's
still
an
attleboro
gap
because
these
rates
aren't
regulated
at
the
national
level,
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
not
by
the
federal--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
the
attleboro
gap
still
exists.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
congress
attempted
to
fill
it,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
congress
thought
attleboro
was
the
law,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong,
they
seemed
to
adopt
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
maybe
you
should
say
professor
tribe
correctly
read
our
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
reason
that
these
rates
aren't
subject
to
the
federal
power
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
was
the
reason
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
it
really
turned
on,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
on
its
position
with
respect
to
wholesale
rates
in
interstate
commerce.
