mr.
cabe,
it's
your
position
that
that
prohibition
arises
from
the
commerce
clause
itself,
i
take
it,
and
not
from
any
other
federal
legislation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
disagree,
i
take
it,
with
the
normal
rule
that
an
amicus
curiae
can't
broaden
the
issues
in
a
case.
that
is,
that
the
fact
that
the
solicitor
general
as
amicus
curiae
raises
an
issue
doesn't
mean
that
it's
necessarily...
he's
entitled
to
do
so.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
rea
is
basically
a
loan
organization.
