so
you're
not
arguing,
then,
that
the
rea
has
preempted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
did
write
in
the
brief
about
the
rea.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
raise
that
argument
before
the
supreme
court
in
arkansas?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
raise
that
preemption
argument
in
arkansas?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
cabe,
didn't
those
cases
have,
though,
the
fact
that
the
federal
power
act
adoption
which
did
result
in
a
preemption
by
congress.
and
what
do
you
do
with
the
illinois
natural
gas
company
case
which
did
recognize
that
there
is
a
balancing
line
of
questions,
as
well
as
the
so-called
mechanical
bright
line
view,
and
in
illinois
gas
declined
to
settle
that
question.
and
isn't
that
the
question
we
have
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
respond
to
the
argument
of
the
appellant
that
even
under
the
more
flexible
test,
the
arkansas
regulatory
attempt
must
be
found
invalid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
opinion
didn't
persuade
enough
of
my
colleagues
to
agree,
though,
did
it?
