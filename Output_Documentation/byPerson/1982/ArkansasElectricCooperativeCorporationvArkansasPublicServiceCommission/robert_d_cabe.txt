mr.
robert
d.
cabe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
out
of
an
attempt
by
the
arkansas
public
service
commission
to
regulate
the
wholesale
sales
of
power
and
energy
by
arkansas
electric
cooperative
corporation
to
its
member
cooperatives.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
affirming
the
psc's
assertion
of
jurisdiction
over
these
wholesale
rates.
the
facts
of
the
case,
while
undisputed,
are
most
important
to
a
determination
of
the
issues
before
the
court.
aecc
is
a
generation
and
transmission
electric
cooperative
which
makes
no
sales
at
retail
to
ultimate
consumers.
it
is
engaged
exclusively
in
sales
at
wholesale.
most
of
these
sales
are
to
its
17
members
who
are
themselves
local
distribution
cooperatives.
the
remainder
of
aecc
sales
are
to
other
utilities
which
also
generate,
transmit
and
sell
electricity
in
interstate
commerce.
aecc's
member
cooperatives
sell
the
energy
they
obtain
to
their
customers,
who
are
the
ultimate
consumers
of
the
power.
the
retail
rates
and
operations
of
the
member
cooperatives
are
fully
regulated
by
the
psc.
aecc
is
concededly
subject
to
psc
jurisdiction
for
purposes
other
than
regulation
of
wholesale
rates.
aecc's
rates,
including
the
ones
at
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case,
are
established
by
aecc's
board
of
directors
which
includes
two
representatives
of
each
of
the
17
local
distribution
cooperatives
who
are
the
members.
succinctly
stated,
aecc
arranges
for
the
power
and
energy
necessary
to
supply
the
needs
of
its
member
cooperatives
in
the
following
manner.
first,
it
owns
and
operates
generating
plants.
second,
it
contracts
with
three
separate
multi-state
systems
to
buy
energy
when
its
facilities
are
insufficient
to
provide
the
needs
or
when
it
could
even
buy
the
power
and
energy
more
economically
than
it
can
generate
it.
third,
because
aecc
has
very
limited
transmission
facilities,
it
arranges
with
these
same
three
multi-state
systems
for
dispatch
and
transmission
on
the
part
of
the
grid
that
is
operated
by
each
of
these
multi-state
systems.
pursuant
to
these
arrangements,
most
of
the
output
of
the
aecc
generating
plants
is
delivered
to
the
grid.
aecc's
member
cooperatives
then
obtain
from
the
grid
the
energy
they
need
to
serve
their
customers.
in
fact,
only
about
10
percent
of
the
energy
which
aecc
sells
to
its
member
cooperatives
is
ever
involved
with
transmission
facilities
actually
owned
by
aecc.
the
other
90
percent
passes
exclusively
over
the
system
or
grid
of
the
multi-state
utilities
with
which
it
does
business.
all
of
the
systems
which
transmit
energy
for
and
sell
energy
to
and
buy
energy
from
aecc
have
generating
facilities
both
in
arkansas
and
in
other
states,
and
all
of
these
generating
facilities
are
tied
into
integrated
systems
among
themselves.
when
energy
is
delivered
by
the
grid
to
a
local
distribution
cooperative,
the
amount
of
the
energy
can,
of
course,
be
metered
and
precisely
measured.
however,
the
generating
source
of
that
energy
may
have
been
at
any
plant
attached
to
that
grid
whether
inside
or
outside
arkansas,
whether
belonging
to
aecc
or
belonging
to
the
generating
facility
of
one
of
the
other
multi-state
systems.
the
psc
in
this
case
does
not
appear
to
seriously
dispute
the
proposition
that
aecc
sales
are
sales
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce.
the
decisions
in
attleboro
and
colton
make
clear
that
the
state
is
prohibited
by
the
commerce
clause
from
regulating
sales
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
our
position
has
always
been
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
primarily
based
on
the
proposition
that
the
commerce
clause,
standing
alone,
prohibits
state
assertion
of
jurisdiction
over
the
rates
in
question.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
pardon
me?
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
yes,
that
argument
was
raised
in
the
briefs
filed
with
the
psc
when
the
matter
was
originally
heard
by
the
psc
at
that
stage
of
the
proceeding.
it
was
raised
briefly
in
the
briefs
at
the
level
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
when
we
submitted
our
jurisdictional
statement
in
this
case,
we
relied
exclusively
on
the
commerce
clause
argument.
however,
before
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted,
the
court
invited
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
to
state
the
views
of
the
united
states,
and
when
the
solicitor
general
did
so
he
employed
a
preemption
analysis
in
support
of
the
argument.
for
that
reason,
we
included
the
preemption
argument,
but
it
is
our
position
that
the
commerce
clause
standing
alone
by
itself
prohibits
state
exercise
of
jurisdiction
in
this
situation.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think,
of
course,
the
court
has
within
its
discretion
the
authority
to
consider
the
point.
in
our
view,
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
that
point.
the
commerce
clause
standing
alone
is
sufficient
to
decide
the
case.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
the
state
court
specifically
held...
the
state
supreme
court
specifically
held
that
the
psc--
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
--i'm
not
sure
the
rea...
we
would
call
it
a
very
strong
rea
submission,
justice
white.
the
supreme
court
specifically
held
in--
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
--it
was...
excuse
me...
it
was
raised
in
the
petition
for
rehearing.
mention
was
made
of
the--
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
--it
was
raised
in
the
initial
briefs
at
the
psc
level
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
was.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
as
i
say,
in
our
view
it
is
not
necessary
to
reach
the
preemption
issue.
it
is
only
necessary
to
consider
the
commerce
clause
aspects
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
i
was
going
to
say,
justice
marshall,
that
the
supreme
court
specifically
said
that
the
psc
was
neither
prohibited
by
the
commerce
clause
nor
preempted
by
any
federal
enactment
from
exercising
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
the
line
of
cases
which
culminated
with
attleboro
concluded
with
respect
to
the
natural
gas
and
electric
utility
industry
that
the
commerce
clause
prohibited
state
regulation
of
the
parts
of
those
businesses
that
were
national
in
character
but
allowed,
in
the
absence
of
conflicting
congressional
enactment,
state
regulation
of
the
parts
of
the
business
that
were
essentially
local.
this
division
between
what
was
essentially
local
and
what
was
of
paramount
national
importance
was
thus
applied
in
the
attleboro
line
of
cases
to
arrive
at
the
rule
that
state
regulation
of
wholesale
sales
in
interstate
commerce
was
not
permissible,
but
states
could
regulate
sales
at
retail
by
local
distributing
companies
to
ultimate
consumers
of
the
energy.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
exactly,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
and
that,
in
fact,
of
course,
is
the
situation
in
texas
where
at
least
until
recently,
utilities
there
generated,
transmitted
and
delivered
power
strictly
in
interstate
commerce
without
interstate
connection.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
it's
not
delivered
directly
from
the
generating
facility;
it
passes
over
transmission
lines
that
aecc
owns.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
after
it
has
gone
onto
the
grid,
then
it
might
come--
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
--not
by
direct
connection,
no.
all
of
those
plants,
all
of
those
local
distributing
cooperatives
are
tied
to
the
grid,
and
that's
where
they
obtain
virtually
all
of
the
energy
that
they
sell
to
their
customers.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
given
the
limited
transmission
facilities
that
aec
owns...
that
aecc
owns,
and
the
desirability
of
buying
energy
and
selling
energy
to
the
other
interstate
companies,
aecc
could
not
accomplish
its
purposes
without
these
complex
arrangements
with
the
multi-state
systems
and
grids,
which
involve
energy
generated
outside
the
state
of
arkansas
as
well
as
energy
generated
inside
the
state
of
arkansas.
the
attleboro
line
of
cases
established
an
admittedly
mechanical
test
for
determining
the
limitation
of
state
power
and
the
area
which
must
be
regulated,
if
at
all,
only
through
exercise
of
federal
power.
however,
the
court
arrived
at
that
test
by
careful
consideration
of
what
was
national
importance
as
opposed
to
what
was
essentially
local
and
could
be,
therefore,
regulated
by
the
states.
i
don't
feel
that
that
test
has
been
changed
or
diminished
in
any
way
by
later
decisions
of
this
court
in
any
cases
dealing
with
the
gas
or
electric
utility
industries.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
in
answer
to
your
first
question,
the
attleboro
line
of
cases
was
decided
before
passage
of
the
federal
power
act.
attleboro
itself,
which
culminated
the
line,
was
decided
in
1927
and
that
act
was
not
passed
until
1935.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
so
it
was
decided
without
reference
to
any
federal
enactment.
secondly,
in
the
illinois
natural
gas
case,
the
court
said
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
reach
that
issue
about
whether
the
balancing
type
approach
was
appropriate
in
view
of
those
other
cases,
although
those
cases
did
not
involve
decisions
dealing
with
either
the
natural
gas
or
electric
utility
cases.
in
our
view,
the
court
did
balance,
back
in
the
attleboro
line,
when
it
determined
what
was
essentially
local
and
what
was
national
in
character.
it
did
take
into
consideration
what
was
of
such
national
importance
that
the
states
could
not
reach
it.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
except
to
the
extent
that
they
are
regulated
or
controlled
or
supervised
by
rea,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
not
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
they
are
not
regulated
by
that
agency.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
perhaps
as
to
the
cooperatives,
yes,
sir,
it
does
still
exist.
if
you
ignore
rea,
then
the
gap
still
exists.
while
the
test--
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
--in
the
federal
power
act?
yes,
congress
did
fill
the
gap
certainly
with
respect
to
investor-owned
utilities,
but
the
fpc
at
that
time
in
the
dairyland
decision
in
1967
concluded
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
include
cooperatives
within
the
definition
of
public
utility
under
the
federal
power
act.
and
that
result
was
concurred
in
by
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
salt
river
project
case.
while
the
test
has
not
been
changed
by
any
later
decision,
the
attleboro
line
of
cases
test
has
not
been
changed
by
any
later
decision,
later
decisions
have
commented
on
the
scope
and
breadth
of
the
test.
in
united
states
versus
public
utilities
commission
of
california,
this
court
illustrated
the
clear
and
decisive
nature
of
the
test
when
it
noted
that
attleboro
left
no
power
in
the
states
to
regulate
sales
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
absolutely.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
yes,
sir.
most
clearly,
the
comments
in
the
congressional
history
seem
to
indicate
quite
clearly
that
congress
assumed
that
attleboro
prohibited
all
state
regulation
of
sales
at
wholesale
and
interstate
commerce,
and
as
indicated
in
the
united
states
versus
public
utilities
commission
case
and
the
colton
case,
this
court
has
affirmed
that
reading
of
the
attleboro
line
of
cases.
also
in
the
united
states
versus
public
utilities
commission
decision
the
court
observed
that
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
federal
power
act
established
limitations
on
the
federal
power
commission
which
"were
designed
to
coordinate
precisely
with
those
constitutionally
imposed
on
the
states.
"
now,
this
brings
us
to
the
colton
case
which
concerned
fpc
jurisdiction
over
sales
by
southern
california
edison
company
entirely
to
customers
located
in
central
and
southern
california,
although
the
sales
in
issue
apparently
included
some
very
small
portion
of
energy
which
was
generated
outside
the
state
of
arkansas.
two
of
the
holdings
of
that
case
are
important
in
our
view.
first,
in
view
of
the
federal
power
act's
establishment
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
precisely
the
area
which
had
been
denied
to
the
states,
the
holding
that
edison
sales
were
sales
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce
under
fpc
jurisdiction
leads
us
to
the
conclusion
that
aecc
sales,
also
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce,
are
beyond
state
power
to
regulate.
second,
we
think
it
important
that
colton
noted
that
the
attleboro
line
of
cases
and
the
test
established
therein
and
adopted
by
congress
made
inappropriate
a
case-by-case
analysis
of
the
impact
of
state
regulation
of
sales
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce,
but
cut
it
cleanly
and
said
that
those
sales
were
entirely
within
federal
power
to
regulate
and
beyond
state
power
to
regulate.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
yes,
sir,
i
would.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
if
you
want
to
apply
the
pike
versus
bruce
church
analysis,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
state
regulation
of
these
sales
is
still
inappropriate.
aecc
as
an
electric
cooperative
is,
by
statute
and
command
of
law,
a
non-profit
organization.
its
revenues
must
equal
its
expenditures.
if
the
state
of
arkansas,
through
regulating
the
sales
to
the
arkansas
local
distribution
cooperatives,
reduces
the
revenues
which
aecc
obtains
from
those
sales,
then
aecc,
to
remain
non-profit
by
command
of
law,
would
then
have
to
raise
the
prices
which
it
charges
to
these
multi-state
systems
to
and
with
which
it
sells
and
exchanges
energy.
so
for
that
reason,
it
would
be
our
conclusion
that
even
under
a
pike
versus
bruce
church
analysis
there
would
be
such
an
impact
on
interstate
commerce,
in
addition
to
all
of
the
reasons
stated
in
the
attleboro
line
of
cases
that
regulation
of
these
sales
should
be
beyond
state
power,
even
if
they
have
not
already
been
so
held.
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
that
attleboro's
recognition
of
the
paramount
national
importance
of
the
regulation
of
sales
of
electricity
at
wholesale
in
interstate
commerce
is
even
more
appropriate
today
than
it
was
in
1927.
this
is
because
of
the
recent
development
of
these
vast,
multi-state,
interconnected
grids
and
pools
which
are
designed
to
provide
power
more
reliably
and
more
economically.
by
utilizing
both
the
facilities
of
these
interstate
systems
or
grids
and
by
utilizing
energy
generated
in
several
states
including
arkansas,
aecc
makes
the
necessary
power
and
energy
available
to
its
member
cooperatives.
attleboro,
in
our
opinion,
is
still
good
constitutional
law,
and
regulation
of
these
sales
by
the
state
of
arkansas
is
beyond
their
constitutional
power,
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
should
be
reversed.
mr.
robert
d.
cabe
only
one
point,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
it
would
be
our
observation
that
the
decision
in
ferc
versus
mississippi
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
finding
in
the
attleboro
line
of
cases
of
paramount
national
importance
in
matters
of
wholesale
sales,
in
view
of
the
court's
approval
of
the
congressional
finding.
retail
sales
now
have
an
immediate
effect
on
interstate
commerce
and
can
be
even
totally
preempted
by
congress.
thank
you
very
much.
