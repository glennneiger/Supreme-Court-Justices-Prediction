mr.
cabe,
suppose
that
attleboro
and
colton
were
not
on
the
books,
had
never
been
decided.
would
you
be
here
making
the
same
argument?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
then
resting,
what,
on
pike
against
bruce?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
let
me
ask
a
pragmatic
question.
why
is
the
commission
so
anxious
to
regulate
these
rates?
isn't
there
a
kind
of
a
built-in
safety
factor
that
the
board
and
the
members
themselves
would
keep
these
rates
at
a
reasonable
level?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
this
administrator
cook
that
you're
referring
to?
