mr.
jeff
broadwater
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
aecc's
argument
that
state
regulation
of
its
rights
is
precluded
by
the
commerce
clause
was
heard
and
rejected
by
the
arkansas
public
service
commission
and
by
a
majority
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
specifically,
as
you've
heard
aecc
argue,
that
this
court's
decision
in
attleboro
and
the
line
of
cases
on
which
the
attleboro
court
relied,
precludes
state
regulation
of
its
sales
to
the
retail
cooperatives.
we
disagree.
aecc
has
interpreted
attleboro
as
barring
state
regulation
of
wholesale
sales
in
interstate
commerce,
and
it
is
argued
that
its
sales
to
the
retail
cooperatives
are
such
sales.
now,
although
these
sales
are
physically
intrastate,
we
agree
that
for
purposes
of
determining
the
scope
of
congressional
power
under
the
commerce
clause,
these
sales
are
in
interstate
commerce.
we
do
not,
however,
agree
that
attleboro
requires
a
reversal
of
the
result
below.
factually,
attleboro
is
clearly
distinct.
that
case
involved
physically
intrastate
sales
between
utilities
in
different
states.
this
case
involves
physically...
excuse
me,
attleboro
involved
physically
interstate
sales
between
utilities
in
separate
states.
this
case
involves
physically
intrastate
sales
between
utilities
in
the
same
state.
aecc
has
not
really
relied
on
the
factual
similarities
in
the
two
cases,
but
it
has
relied
on
some
of
the
language
and
analysis
in
attleboro
and
in
the
attleboro
line
of
cases.
the
attleboro
court
i
think
started
with
the
premise
that
the
states
could
not
impose
a
direct
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
wholesale
rights
were
generally
seen
to
be
in
interstate
commerce.
retail
rights
were
generally
seen
to
be
essentially
local.
rate
regulation
was
seen
to
be
a
burden
on
commercial
activity.
therefore,
the
states
could
regulate
the
retail
rates
but
they
couldn't
regulate
the
wholesale
rates.
aecc's
mistake,
i
think,
is
in
assuming
that
this
court's
analysis
of
commerce
clause
issues
has
not
evolved
beyond
this
point.
the
doctrine
that
a
state
can
never
impose
a
direct
burden
on
interstate
commerce
is
simply
no
longer
the
law.
professor
lawrence
tribe,
in
his
book,
"american
constitutional
law"
discusses
the
attleboro
decision.
he
doesn't
criticize
the
result
reached
there,
but
he
does
say
this
of
the
analysis.
he
says,
the
opinion
was
couched
in
terms
of
the
now-discredited
direct/indirect
dichotomy.
and
then
quoting
from
the
opinion,
"being
the
imposition
of
a
direct
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
it
must
necessarily
fall.
"
i
think
the
later
decisions
of
this
court
support
professor
tribe's
characterization
of
the
direct/indirect
dichotomy
as
a
now-discredited
doctrine.
for
example,
in
south
carolina--
mr.
jeff
broadwater
--i
think
so.
for
example,
in
the
south
carolina
state
highway
department
versus
the
barlowe
brothers,
the
court
says
that
indeed,
in
many
instances,
state
regulation
of
interstate
commerce
has
been
upheld.
mr.
justice
stone,
writing
for
the
court,
recited
dozens
of
cases
in
which
state
regulation
of
a
variety
of
subjects...
railroads,
navigable
waterways,
highways,
quarantine
laws,
game
laws...
had
been
upheld,
even
though,
he
said,
in
each
of
these
cases,
regulation
involves
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
but
so
long
as
the
state
action
does
not
discriminate,
the
burden
is
one
which
the
constitution
permits
because
it
is
an
inseparable
incident
of
the
exercise
of
a
legislative
authority
which,
under
the
constitution,
has
been
left
to
the
states.
i
think
a
more
recent
case
reflecting
the
court's
departure
from
the
direct
burden
analysis
used
in
attleboro
is
ferc
versus
mississippi,
decided
just
last
term.
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
retail
rates
were
in
interstate
commerce,
but
noted...
and
i
don't
think
anyone
doubted
it...
that
the
states
retained
the
power
to
regulate
retail
rates.
now,
under
the
direct
burden
test,
if
retail
rates
are
in
interstate
commerce,
the
states
can't
regulate
them.
the
fact
that
retail
rates
are
now
seen
to
be
in
interstate
commerce
and
yet,
the
state's
power
to
regulate
them
isn't
contested,
i
think
is
evidence
of
how
far
the
court
has
come
from
the
direct
burden
analysis
used
in
attleboro.
now,
the
colton
case
doesn't
endorse
the
position...
doesn't
the
support
the
position
of
aecc,
and
doesn't
endorse
the
attleboro
decision.
the
colton
case
cites
an
earlier
case
interpreting
the
natural
gas
act,
the
illinois
natural
gas
company
case.
and
in
both
those
cases,
the
court
says
that
two
lines
of
cases
dealing
with
state
power
under
the
commerce
clause
exist.
the
attleboro
line
and
the
more
flexible
line.
and
the
court
says
that...
i
think
implicitly
in
colton
and
expressly
in
illinois
natural
gas...
that
it
doesn't
have
to
choose...
that
in
those
cases
it
didn't
have
to
choose
between
the
two
lines
of
cases.
that
when
congress
passed
the
natural
gas
act
and
when
it
passed
the
federal
power
act,
it
had
attleboro
in
mind,
and
it
was
trying
to
remedy
what
it
saw
as
the
jurisdictional
back
credit
by
attleboro.
the
court
interpreted
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
federal
power
act
accordingly
to
simply
achieve
the
intent
of
congress,
and
congress
had
attleboro
in
mind
when
it
passed
those
statutes.
mr.
jeff
broadwater
well,
i
think
whether
or
not
the
commission
ought
to
regulate
aecc
is
a
legislative
question,
and
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
arkansas
has
decided
we
ought
to.
and
i
think
there
are
some
factors
that
support
that.
i
don't
think
aecc
has
really
presented
any
evidence
to
us
exactly
how
the
self-regulation
works.
i
know
it
takes
the
commission
a
team
of
accountants
and
engineers
and
economists
and
lawyers
to
set
and
design
electric
rates.
i
think
it's
really
unlikely
that
the
average
customer
or
the
average
retail
cooperative
is
going
to
be
in
a
position
to
be
able
to
really
participate
in
the
making
of
aecc's
rates.
i
don't
see
how
self-regulation
would
necessarily
protect
the
interest
of
a
minority
within
the
cooperative.
i
don't
know
what's
to
stop
a
majority
within
the
cooperative
from
deciding
they're
going
to
force
the
minority
to
subsidize
them.
and
something
i
would
note
just
in
passing...
each
one
of
the
cooperatives
has
the
same
representation
on
aecc's
board,
regardless
of
the
size
of
the
cooperative.
which
means
the
one
man/one
vote
rule
that
this
court
has
said
is
required
in
the
legislative
bodies
doesn't
even
exist
on
the
aecc's
board.
so
i
wonder
how
representative
it
may
be
of
the
members.
i
think
this
court
in
recent
cases
has,
indeed,
chosen
between
the
rigid
test
selected
in
attleboro
and
the
more
flexible
test,
and
i
think
in
pike
versus
bruce
church
and
in
subsequent
cases
it
has
adopted
the
more
flexible
test.
mr.
jeff
broadwater
i
don't
agree
with
that,
because
i
think
that
first,
the
sales
are
essentially
local.
they're
between
an
arkansas
buyer
and
an
arkansas
seller.
virtually
all
the
electricity
is
consumed
in
arkansas.
aecc
has
three
plants
in
arkansas;
it
owns
partial
interest
in
three
others;
virtually
all
of
the
power
is
generated
in
arkansas.
all
the
parties
to
the
transactions
have
ready
access
to
the
political
and
legal
processes
of
the
state
of
arkansas
for
the
protection
of
their
interests.
now,
aecc
has
said
that
well,
since
some
of
this
power
may
come
from
out
of
state,
it's
not
essentially
local
and
the
state
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
regulate
it.
in
response
to
that,
i
would
say
that
same
power
is
the
power
that's
sold
at
the
retail
level,
and
we're
there
allowed
to
regulate
that.
so
that
the
aside
of
generation
may
not
necessarily
be
controlling.
so
i
think
under
pike
versus
bruce
church,
first,
we
should
prevail
because
it's
essentially
local,
and
second,
really
the
only
burden
that
the
aecc
has
alleged,
i
think,
is
the
burden
of
having
to
participate
in
a
rate-making
procedure
before
a
state
regulatory
commission.
well,
that
burden
is
no
different
than
the
burden
we're
allowed
to
impose
at
the
retail
level,
and
it's
no
different
than
the
burden
that
congress
has
imposed
on
the
wholesale
sale
of
investor-owned
utilities
before
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
so
i
think
that
a
burden
that
is
clearly
permissible
in
these
other
contexts
shouldn't
be
held
to
clearly
outweigh
the
state
interest
in
essentially
local
commercial
activity.
and
i
think
pike
versus
bruce
church
is
the
proper
test.
mr.
jeff
broadwater
the
federal
power
act...
the
federal
power
commission
held
that
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
over
the
rates,
and
the
federal
court
of
appeals
i
think
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
has
also
held--
mr.
jeff
broadwater
--i
think
there's
an
exemption
in
the
federal
power
act
for
government
instrumentalities.
mr.
jeff
broadwater
i
think
on
that--
mr.
jeff
broadwater
--no,
your
honor.
and
i
think
it
was
that
and
also,
we
should
remember
that
the
federal
power
act
was
passed,
i
think,
in
1935.
the
rea
was
passed
in
1936,
so
when
congress
passed
the
federal
power
act
they
didn't
have
really
a
clear
idea
of
what
form
the
cooperatives
were
going
to
take.
and
i
think
in
part
because
of
that,
the
federal
power
commission
was
hesitant
to
exert
jurisdiction
over
something
that
didn't
really
exist
when
the
federal
power
commission
was
created.
but
it
wasn't
the
distinction
between
wholesale
and
retail
rates
that
was
crucial.
the
purpose
that
the
commerce
clause
is
designed
to
achieve
is
to,
i
think,
promote
free
trade
among
the
states
and
to
prevent
economic
warfare
among
the
states.
and
i
think
that
the
more
flexible
test
in
pike
versus
bruce
church
would
better
accomplish
that
purpose
than
a
mechanical
distinction
between
wholesale
and
retail
rights.
for
example,
imagine
a
generating
cooperative
selling
electricity...
doing
business
in
one
state,
selling
electricity
to
a
small
rural
retail
cooperative.
and
imagine
a
large
investor-owned
utility
selling
large
amounts
of
power
to
a
multi-national
manufacturing
concern.
which
has
the
greater
impact
on
interstate
commerce
and
on
the
national
economy?
i
suggest
the
retail
sale
to
the
large
manufacturing
company
may
really
be
of
greater
significance.
and
i
would
also
suggest
that
the
abuses
the
commerce
clause
was
designed
to
prevent
may
be
more
likely
to
occur
in
the
case
of
the
retail
sales
because
there,
the
state
commission
may
be
tempted
to
set
that
industrial
customer's
rates
very
high
so
he
can
subsidize
other
customer
classes,
and
then
they'll
expect
him
to
recover
his
added
costs
through
sales
in
other
states
or
even
in
foreign
countries.
the
mechanical
distinction
between
wholesale
and
retail
rates
would
have
the
commerce
clause
i
think
ignore
those
kind
of
political
and
economic
realities.
aecc
in
its
brief
argued
the
virtue
of
self-regulation.
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
arkansas
legislature
that
self-regulation
was
not
the
answer.
twenty-five
states
have
placed
retail
cooperatives
under
the
jurisdiction
of
state
regulatory
commissions.
yet,
aecc
is
one
step
farther
removed
from
the
ultimate
customer
than
are
the
retail
cooperatives.
and
for
that
reason,
i
would
suggest
that
the
need
for
state
regulation
in
the
case
of
aecc
is
even
greater
than
the
need
for
state
regulation
in
the
case
of
the
retail
cooperatives.
and
neither
is
rea
regulation
sufficient.
aecc
admits
that
rea
gives
it
considerable
discretion
in
setting
its
rates,
and
no
real
evidence
has
been
presented
that
rea
examines,
say,
questions
of
rate
design.
even
though
the
commission
noted
in
its
brief
that
we
consider
rate
design
issues
to
be
as
important
as
questions
dealing
with
the
level
of
rates.
i
think
the
reason
for
the
lack
of
scrutiny
from
rea
is
obvious.
there
are
over
a
thousand
cooperatives
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
administrator
of
the
rea.
if
only
a
fourth
of
those
cooperatives
seek
rate
increases
annually,
the
administrator
of
the
rea
is
reduced
to
reviewing
one
rate
case
virtually
every
working
day.
mr.
jeff
broadwater
that's
right.
and
there's
even
very
little
statutory
authority
that
would,
i
think,
justify
their
getting
in
the
rate-making
business.
section
904
of
the
rea
provides
that
before
the
administrator
makes
loans,
he
should
certify
that
reasonable
adequate
security
exists.
and
that's
really
all
there
is,
i
think,
in
the
act
from
which
you
can
infer
any
rea
authority
over
the
rates.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
rural
electrification
act
was
pending
before
congress,
the
first
administrator
of
the
rea
testified
before
a
congressional
committee
that
he
thought
the
setting
of
rates
was
entirely
a
state
matter,
and
that
he
didn't
have
any
jurisdiction
over
the
setting
of
rates
within
a
single
state.
now,
you
might
ask,
did
he
have
retail...
only
retail
rates
in
mind
or
was
he
thinking
in
terms
of
wholesale
rates.
i
think
it's
very
likely
that
the
testimony
went
to
both
wholesale
and
retail
rates
because
the
original
act
provided
for
the
creation
of
both
wholesale
and
retail
cooperatives.
so
i
think
clearly,--
mr.
jeff
broadwater
--yes,
sir.
so
i
think
clearly,
if
these
rates
are
to
be
given
any
real
scrutiny,
it's
going
to
have
to
come
from
the
state
level.
aecc
has
argued
that
there
could
be
conflict
between
state
regulation
and
the
rea.
yet,
25
states
regulate
the
retail
rates;
a
dozen
states
regulate
wholesale
rates,
and
despite
this
extensive
history,
aecc
has
not
produced
a
single
example
of
an
actual
conflict
between
state
regulation
and
the
end
regulation
under
the
rea.
i
would
suggest
that
this
failure
of
proof
demonstrates
that
this
alleged
conflict
is
really
mere
speculation
and
that
if
it
ever
does
occur,
i
think
that's
something
that
congress
could
remedy.
madame
justice
o'connor
in
her
opinion
in
ferc
versus
mississippi
observed
that
the
utility
regulation
is
a
field
marked
by
valuable
state
innovation.
that,
indeed,
the
whole
body
of
experience
in
this
area
has
developed
at
the
state
level.
we
are
simply--
mr.
jeff
broadwater
--that
may
be
unfortunate.
but
we're
simply
asking
that
this
court
allow
that
development
to
continue.
thank
you.
