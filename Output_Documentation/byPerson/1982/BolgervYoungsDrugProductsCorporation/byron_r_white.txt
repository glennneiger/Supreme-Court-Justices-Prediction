r.
white
mr.
strauss,
to
what
extent
is
the
least
restrictive
alternative
analysis
applicable
to
commercial
speech?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
sort
of
a
relative
of
overbreadth?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
reaches
more,
it
reaches
farther
than
it
need
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
least
restrictive
approach,
is
that
one
of
the
rules
applicable
to
commercial
speech
as
you
find
these
rules
in
our
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solovy,
do
you
think
the...
can
you
live
with
what
the
district
court
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
is
constitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would
think
it
was
unconstitutional,
in
view
of
your
argument
you
just
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
didn't
cross-petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
again.
do
you
think
it
is
constitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
are
free
to
challenge
such
restrictions
in
some
other
form?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
the
case
come
up
in
this
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
mail...
this
is
of
nationwide
application?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
you
mail
something
without
complying
with
this
injunction,
you
are
in
contempt,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
they
thought
it
was
quite
a
clear
issue
that
didn't
require
any
more
debate.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
weren't
here
then.
