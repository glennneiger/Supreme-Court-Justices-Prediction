mr.
strauss,
you
have
advanced
two
goals,
anyway.
what
evidence
is
there
in
the
record
that
these
goals
were
in
the
minds
of
congress?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
there
are
some
physicians
who
don't
want
to
receive
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
these
are
offensive
to
recipients?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
all
you
have
to
do
is
bring
in
100
people
who
say,
it's
offensive
to
me.
that
is...
we
do
it
every
day
in
trial.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
an
argument
could
be
made
it
is
rather
underinclusive,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because
it
doesn't
exclude
a
lot
of
other,
much
more
offensive
material.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
when
you
say
that,
that
almost
implies
to
me
that
it
is
not
content
neutral.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
black
letter
law
from
what,
valentine
against
christianson?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
call
that
black
letter
law?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
by
whom?
