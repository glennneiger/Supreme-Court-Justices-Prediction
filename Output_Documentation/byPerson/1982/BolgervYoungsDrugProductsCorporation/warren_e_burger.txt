we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
bolger
against
youngs
drug
products
corporation.
mr.
strauss,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
legislative
branch
accomplish
the
same
objective
of
the
statute
along
the
lines
of
the
statute
that
we
dealt
with
in
the
rowan
case,
where
they
could
put
up
a
barrier
and
say,
we
don't
want
any
mail
from
this
company?
would
that
accomplish
this
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
don't
mean
to
make
a
carbon
copy
of
the
statute,
but
to
just
give
each
householder
the
privilege
of
saying,
i
don't
want
any
mail
from
sears
roebuck
company,
or
from
montgomery
ward,
or
from
anybody.

mr.
solovy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
congress
could
pass
essentially
a
rowan
statute
in
this
context,
as
i
suggested
to
your
friend?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
have
no
trouble
with
that
on
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
are
you
suggesting
that
without
any
additional
legislation,
the
addressee,
any
householder
could
operate
under
the
rowan
section
of
the
statute
and
stop
the
mailings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
strauss?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
