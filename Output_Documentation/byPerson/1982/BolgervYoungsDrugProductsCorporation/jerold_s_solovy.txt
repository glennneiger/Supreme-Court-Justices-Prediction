mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
really
a
very
simple
case.
the
margin
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
first
amendment
area
command,
we
believe,
the
affirmance
of
judge
penn's
decision
invalidating
this
statute.
the
government
speaks
about
the
statute
as
if
it
had
specific
purposes
and
it
were
specially
confined.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
as
the
government
concedes
in
its
brief,
there
is
no
legislative
history
supporting
the
asserted
purposes
the
government
has
put
forth,
namely,
sensitivity
in
the
protection
of
minors.
indeed,
the
government
says
that
the
statute
was
carefully
drawn
to
excluded
the
non-commercial
advertiser,
planned
parenthood,
but
for
three
years
the
government
interpreted
the
statute
to
excluded
all
unsolicited
communication
concerning
contraception,
because
it
was
the
vestige
in
the
antagonism
of
the
comstock
act.
you
could
not
speak
in
the
twentieth
century,
the
year
1973,
to
the
listener
about
contraception.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
am
glad
you
asked
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
congress
passed
the
rowan
statute,
and
what
the
government
overlooks
is,
this
is
part
of
the
same
title
of
the
same
section
of
the
post
office
reorganization
act
of
1970.
they
passed
these
two
sections
at
the
same
time,
and
although
the
government
says
that
section
3008,
which
is
the
rowan
statute,
doesn't
apply
to
this
situation,
it
applies
directly.
congress
resolved
the
problem.
what
does
section
3008
say?
it
says
that
if
i,
the
recipient,
receive
material
which
i
find
to
be
provocative,
as
this
court
says,
salacious,
i
in
my
unfettered
discretion
can
say
to
the
sender,
send
me
no
more
of
this
material.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
none
whatsoever.
youngs
is
delighted
with
that
position,
because
what
does
section
3008
do?
what
does
rowan
do?
it
balances
the
first
amendment
interest
of
youngs,
the
person
trying
to
convey
information,
and
the
addressee.
this
court
held
that
the
reason
that
3008
was
constitutional
because
it
struck
a
perfect
balance
between
the
interest
of
the
sender
and
the
interest
of
the
recipient,
and
it
gave
this
sweeping
power
to
the
addressee
because
it
did
not
allow
the
government
to
be
the
censor
as
to
what
we
would
receive
in
the
mail.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
exactly,
your
honor.
that
is
what
section
3008
says.
it
is
part
of
the
same
title.
and
the
interest
that
the
government
put
forth
in
favor
of
this
iron
curtain
of
unsolicited
mail
that
section
3001
forwards,
it
did
not
put
forward
in
the
associated
student
case.
indeed,
the
district
judge,
and
the
government
acquiesced
in
that
decision,
found
that
3001
was
the
opinion
of
congress
that
the
subject
of
contraception
was
immoral.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
contend
otherwise.
i
am
pointing
out,
however,
that
in
the
associated
student
case,
they
did
not
put
forth
any
legislative
history.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
the
point
i
draw
from
it
is
that
the
legislative
history
that
there
is
does
not
speak
to
section
3001,
but
speaks
to
section
3008,
because
that
is
where
congress
said
that
people
were
offended
by
certain
types
of
mail,
and
that
the
recipient
should
have
the
right
to
cut
off
that
mail,
and--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--i
think
a
judge,
be
he
a
district
judge,
an
appellate
judge,
or
a
supreme
court
judge,
if
there
is
reason
to
what
he
says,
commends
repetition.
that
is
my
sole
point.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
congress
has
not
done
so.
congress
has
only
acted--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--i
think
that
congress,
so
long
as
it
is
content
neutral
and
speaks
across
the
board,
congress
could
say
that
no
mailer
can
send
any
unsolicited
mail
of
a
commercial
nature
to
any
household.
just
asking
the
question,
though,
shows
that
it
is
a
difficult
constitutional
question,
but
certainly
congress
could
not
single
out,
as
it
does
in
3001,
a
specific
content
subject,
namely,
the
subject
of
contraception,
and
say
this
may
not
go
to
the
household.
now--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
as
a
smoker
i
suppose
i
would
have
some
hesitation,
but
they
banned
it
from
television.
they
don't
ban
it
from
the
print
media.
i
think...
i
don't
speak
for
the
tobacco
industry,
but
i
would
have
some
problem
with
that.
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
there
is
no
such...
it
is
quite
the
obverse.
when
you
have
a
situation
where
you
have
venereal
disease
of
epidemic
proportions
in
this
country,
20
million
cases
of
herpes,
when
you
have
unwanted
pregnancies,
when
you
have
problems
with
abortions,
the
problem
is
the
obverse.
the
problem
is
the
obverse
of
the
smoker
who
shouldn't
smoke.
i
shouldn't
smoke.
i
know
that.
but
at
least
if
i
were
educated
and
the
country
were
educated
in
the
field
of
contraception
and
venereal
disease
prevention,
we
could
avoid
a
lot
of
mischief
and
a
lot
of
grief
in
this
country.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
theory
of
the
first
amendment
is
antipaternalism.
the
government
shouldn't
tell
the
people
what
they
should
think
and
what
subjects
they
should
think
about.
that
is
the
theory
of
the
first
amendment,
and
that's
the
strength
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
what
is
offensive?
the
government
says
this
material
is
offensive.
we
have
in
appendix
25
of
our
brief
plain
talk
about
venereal
disease.
well,
is
that
offensive?
it
is
offensive
if
you
contract
a
venereal
disease,
but
this
pamphlet
tells
you
what
to
do
to
avoid
venereal
disease,
and
there
is
nothing
commercial
about
this
pamphlet.
all
it
says
on
the
back
of
it
is,
"contributed
by
youngs
drug
products
corporation.
"
"you
could
take
that
off
and
put
planned
parenthood
on
the
back
of
it,
and
indeed,
under
the
government's
interpretation,
planned
parenthood
could
mail
this
brochure,
youngs
cannot.
"
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes.
again,
though,
that
becomes
very
subjective.
i
say
the
standard.
if
any
of
you
have
the
misfortune
to
watch
daytime
television,
you
will
see
they
apply
a
very
loose
standard,
and
what
i
see
on
television
is
much
more
offensive
to
me
than
the
youngs
ads,
because
you
see
subjects
of
extramarital
behavior--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--but
the
question
is,
did
congress
make
a
judgment
based
upon
any
interest,
or
was
it
the
vestige
of
the
comstock
act,
and
we
submit
that
it
was
only
the
vestige
of
the
comstock
act.
now,
going
to
the
pacifica
case,
this
court
dealt
with
that
in
consolidated
edison,
and
distinguished
the
airwave
media
as
being
different
because,
number
one,
there
was
sort
of
a
monopoly.
you
could
only
get
a
certain
number
of
channels.
number
two,
that
was
particularly
intrusive,
and
you
could
not
control
it.
unlike
section
3008,
you,
either
to
protect
yourself
or
your
children
from
affront,
you
either
have
to
throw
your
radio
or
tv
out
the
window,
or
you
have
to
stop
watching
it,
or
you
have
to
be
subject
to
the
affront,
whereas
under
the
rowan
solution,
once
you
receive
one
mailing
which
you
deem
to
be
offensive,
you
can
cut
that
mailing
off
forever
by
advising
the
post
office,
and
you
never
get
offended
again.
that
is
very
unlike
the
radio
and
tv
media,
and
we
submit
that
that's
entirely
different.
now,
this
court
has
stated
repeatedly,
and
the
government
concedes
that
in
this
area
of
contraception,
this
is
an
area
of
specially
protected
constitutional
value.
the
decision,
this
court
has
held,
of
a
person
whether
to
bear
or
beget
a
child
is
a
basic
right
of
privacy.
that
was
the
foundation
for
this
court's
decision
in
griswald,
eisenstadt,
bigelow,
and
carey,
and
indeed,
in
bigelow,
which
as
you
will
recall
was
an
advertisement
dealing
with
abortion
services,
this
court
said
that
the
advertisement
does
much
more
than
propose
a
mere
commercial
transaction.
it
contains
material
of
clear
public
interest.
now,
the
government
is
trying
to
apply
in
this
case
a
commercial
speech
test.
we
believe
that
that
is
incorrect.
number
one,
there
is
no
bright
line
between
commercial
and
non-commercial
speech.
if
you
look
at
the
materials
in
our
appendix,
you
are
going
to
see
an
admixture
of
information,
some
commercial
some
non-commercial,
and
a
combination
of
both.
but
this
court
held
in
bigelow
that
information
of
this
type
in
this
area,
in
the
area
of
contraception
and
family
planning,
has
a
special
constitutional
status,
and
before
the
government
may
intrude
upon
that
area,
they
must
show
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
and
indeed,
even
if
there
were
not
this
specially
protected
constitutional
value,
because
this
statute
is
content
related,
it
is
not
content
neutral,
and
because
it
discriminates
against
speakers,
that
is,
planned
parenthood
can
speak
where
we
cannot
speak,
then
this
governmental
restriction
is
still
subject
to
the
most
compelling
interest
test.
however,
if
you
retreat
from
that
test
and
just
say
that
they
have
to
show
a
substantial
interest,
nevertheless,
the
law
is
clear
that
even
in
the
commercial
speech
area
the
government
must
restrict
the
speech
in
the
least
restrictive
manner,
and
this
is
not
the
least
restrictive
manner.
congress
struck
that
balance
in
section
3008.
that
is
the
least
restrictive
manner.
and
that
is
why
this
court
in
rowan
affirmed
section
3008.
that
is
the
least
restrictive
manner,
because
it
gives
youngs
the
right
to
mail
and
mr.
strauss
the
right
if
he
does
not
want
to
receive
the
mail
to
cut
off
the
mail.
and
this
statute,
whether
you
measure
it
on
a
compelling
interest
test,
a
substantial
interest
test,
will
not
pass
constitutional
muster
on
any
basis,
because
it
is
not
the
least
restrictive
means.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
justice
white,
i
am
not
sure
that
judge
penn's--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
my
partners
and
i,
when
we
received
the
decision,
said,
this
is
not
a
perfect
decision,
but
in
this
age
of
litigation
and
costs,
we
certainly
could
live
with
that
decision,
because
youngs
is
not
in
the--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--we
were
quite
satisfied
with
judge
penn's
solution.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
what
he
did?
i
think
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
i
think
he
thought
it
an
unnecessary
burden
on
us.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes.
but
i
did
not
choose
to
cross-appeal,
because
i
could
live
with
the
result.
my
client
could
live
with
the
result.
we
are
not
interested
in
offending
anyone,
and
it
did
not
bother
us
to
put
this
material
in
an
envelope.
it
did
not
bother
us
to
say,
this
is
contraceptive
information.
it
did
not
bother
them...
us
to
tell
them
that
they
had
a
statutory
right
under
section
3008.
it
probably
was
an
unconstitutional
burden,
but
in
a
practical
world
we
didn't
care,
because
my
client
is
not
interested
in
offending
anyone.
we
are
not
interested
in
drowning
people
with
mail
they
don't
want
to
have.
we
think
it
is
important
information.
why
was
that
condition
that
judge
penn
had
posed
unconstitutional?
because
it
doesn't
apply
to
other
mailers.
it
doesn't
apply
to
planned
parenthood.
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
purveyor
of
salacious
material.
indeed,
if
you
look
at
the
congressional
balance,
if
you
look
from
section
3008
to
section
3010,
that
borders
on
really
hard-core
material,
and
even
there,
as
to
section
3010,
which
talks
about
advertisements
depicting
intercourse
in
natural
and
unnatural
acts
and
human
genitalia,
even
there
congress
struck
the
balance
by
saying
that
the
government
may
not
act
as
a
censor,
may
not
cut
off
the
mail.
it
is
the
right
of
the
recipient.
now,
to
get
back...
that
is
a
long-winded
answer
to
a
very
short
question,
justice
white.
yes,
i
think
it
was
unconstitutional,
the
condition
he
imposed,
but
he
held
the
statute
unconstitutional.
it
opened
up
our
line
of
communication,
and
we
are
willing
to
live
with
that.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
appeal
every
time
you
win
because
you
don't
get
perfect
justice.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
you
mean
the
conditions
he
imposed?
no,
i
think
we
are
bound
by
that.
that
is
the
law
of
the
case
as
to
us.
we
were
the
litigants,
and
he
said
we
must
abide
by
these
conditions.
we
accepted
those.
i
don't
think
we
are
free
to
contest
that.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
because
my
partner,
mr.
graham,
said
i
had
to
sue
here
because
this
was
the
proper
venue.
i
would
have
preferred
to
sue
in
chicago,
but
he
told
me
i
had
to
sue
here.
the
post
office
was
here.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that's
right.
we
do
not
intend
to
stand
in
contempt
of
judge
penn
or
any
other
court,
particularly
this
court.
0
[generallaughter.]
now,
you
know,
we
did
not
raise
the
question
of
whether
judge
penn
could
impose
this
condition.
the
government
did.
if
the
government
wants
to
remove
that
restriction,
then
we
would
be
subject
to
the
provisions
of
3008.
we
would
do
it
still
in
the
same
tasteful
manner.
we
are
going
to
put
it
in
envelopes,
except
for
the
drug
store
flier.
as
i
think
the
court
pointed
out
and
the
amicus
pointed
out,
the
drug
flier
contains
material
that
might
be
offensive
to
people
other
than
our
own
product.
it
talks
about
sanitary
napkins,
et
cetera.
and
what
is
offensiveness,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
like
beauty,
is
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder.
i
may
be
much
more
offended
by
consolidated
edison's
discussion
of
nuclear
energy
and
feel
that
that
intrudes
upon
my
rights
to
rear
my
children
much
more
than
i
may
be
on
contraceptive
material.
so,
it
is
very
dangerous
for
the
government
to
act
as
a
censor
on
the
notion
of
offensiveness.
if
that
is
the
hallmark
of
the
first
amendment's
offensiveness,
we
would
be
in
deep
trouble.
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
stand
for
that
proposition.
now,
we
talked
about
the
comstock
act.
the
comstock
act
was
passed
in
1873,
and
it
was
clear
that
it
was
the
moral
judgment
of
mr.
comstock
and
the
people
as
that
time
that
you
should
not
speak
about
contraception.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes,
after
one
hour
of
debate--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
interestingly
enough,
in
my
research,
i
found
that
mr.
comstock
had
as
his
legislative
assistant
the
justice
of
the
supreme
court
who
drafted
the
statute.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
can't
remember
the
name.
can
you?
we
will
have
to
look
it
up,
but
it
was
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court.
he
did
mr.
comstock's
handiwork,
and
congress
passed
it.
and
it
was
the...
so
i
guess
we
all
here
somewhat
share
the
blame
of
this
statute.
0
[generallaughter.]
not
looking
at
anyone
in
particular,
however.
now,
that
statute
remained
in
effect
with
various
minor
changes
until
the
post
office
reorganization
act
of
1970.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
the
original
act?
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
1873.
we

the

it
is
somewhere.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
meant
no
personal
aspersion,
justice
brennan.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
the
senator?
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
he
was
from
new
york
city.
i
might
add
as
another
historic
antecedent
that
it
is
interesting,
not
only...
when
this
1873
act
was
passed,
not
only
could
women
not
vote,
but
in
the
city
of
new
york,
to
get
the
historical
perspective
correct,
women
in
new
york
city
could
not
go
to
a
restaurant
unaccompanied
by
a
male.
otherwise,
they
would
be
violating
the
law.
and
mr.
comstock,
of
course,
was
a
mortal
enemy
of
the
birth
control
movement,
and
particularly
margaret
sanger.
but
moving
from
1873
to
1970,
when
they
changed
the
act,
it
was
originally
proposed
that
all
vestiges
against
prohibiting
unsolicited
mail
concerning
contraceptives
be
eliminated.
the
post
office
took
that
view,
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare,
and
the
department
of
labor.
somewhere
along
the
line,
the
post
office
changed
its
mind
and
recommended
to
congress
that
they
retain
the
restriction
on
unsolicited...
justice
strong,
i
am
told,
is
the
author.
justice
strong.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
pardon?
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
i
think
that
is
correct,
justice
brennan,
but
mr.
comstock
took
his
friends
where
he
could
find
them.
0
[generallaughter.]
he
might
even
have
taken
a
justice
from
illinois.
we
don't
know.
in
any
event,
the
post
office
changed
its
mind,
and
said,
retain
this
restriction
on
unsolicited
contraceptive
advertisement.
congress
adopted
that
without
any
discussion.
the
post
office
gave
no
reason.
congress
gave
no
reason.
but
at
the
same
time,
and
under
the
same
title,
it
did
discuss
and
it
did
adopt
section
3008,
which
balanced
the
right
of
the
sender
and
the
right
of
the
recipient,
and
struck
the
balance
on
the
side
of
the
mailer
to
mail
and
on
the
side
of
the
recipient
to
cut
off.
now,
if
rowan
itself
were
not
dispositive
of
this
case,
then
we
should
look
at
the
decision
of
this
court
in
carey
versus
population
services
international,
because
there,
the
state
of
new
york
in
banning
contraceptive
advertisement
put
forth
the
very
same
reason
that
the
government
puts
forth
here.
one,
sensitivity,
and
two,
the
protection
of
minors.
and
this
court
held,
and
i
think
most
of
the
court
joined
in
this
expression,
but
these
are
not
classically
justifications
validating
the
suppression
of
expression
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
government's
asserted
interests
in
this
case
were
expressly
rejected
by
this
court
in
carey,
and
going
on,
foreshadowing
this
case,
this
court
stated
at
page
678,
"appellant
suggests
no
distinction
between
commercial
and
non-commercial
speech
that
would
render
these
discredited
arguments
meritorious
when
offered
to
justify
prohibitions
on
commercial
speech.
"
"on
the
contrary,
such
arguments
are
clearly
directed
not
at
any
commercial
aspect
of
the
prohibited
advertising
but
at
the
ideas
conveyed
and
form
of
expression,
the
core
of
first
amendment
values.
"
and
that
is
what
we
have
here.
we
have
hostility
to
the
ideas
conveyed
and
the
form
of
expression.
and
justice
powell,
i
believe,
stated
it
very
well
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
carey
when
he
talked
about
the
privacy
of
the
home
as
being
the
best
place
for
one
to
consider
and
study
this
important
subject,
that
the
marketplace,
no
matter
how
impersonal,
was
not
anonymous
and
that
the
home
was
the
proper
place
for
this
subject,
and
indeed,
justice
powell
pointed
out
in
a
footnote
that
although
at
the
home
one
bore
the
risk
of
this
material
and
information
falling
into
the
hands
of
minors,
that
did
not
justify
cutting
it
off
from
the
home,
because
that
would
burden
the
rights,
constitutional
rights
of
adults.
if
rowan
doesn't
solve
the
problem,
and
if
carey
does
not
lay
this
problem
to
rest,
then
certainly
this
court's
decision
in
consolidated
edison
is
on
all
fours
with
this
case,
because
there,
you
had
a
person
commercially
interested
talking
about
nuclear
power.
here
we
have
youngs,
who
is
in
the
business
of
birth
control
and
prevention
of
venereal
disease.
that
is
the
heart
and
essence
of
our
business
in
a
protected
area.
but
in
consolidated
edison,
that
regulation
was
struck.
this
court
applied
the
compelling
interest
test,
because
the
regulation
was
content
based,
and
it
was
speaker
discrimination.
this
court
held
that
the
corporate
speaker
may
not
be
discriminated
against,
and
we
submit
that
youngs
may
not
be
discriminated
against.
new
york,
like
the
government
here,
said,
oh,
this
is
content
neutral,
because
we
are
banning
all
speech
on
this
subject,
just
like
the
government
says
here,
this
is
content
neutral.
we
don't
have
any
hostility
towards
contraception.
you
just
can't
talk
about
that.
but
in
consolidated
edison,
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
first
amendment,
if
it
means
anything,
means
the
government
cannot
prohibit
speech
of
an
entire
topic.
in
consolidated
edison,
the
state
of
new
york,
like
the
government
here,
alleged
captive
audience,
intrusiveness
upon
the
home,
and
this
court
held,
well,
you
could
take
the
advertisement,
put
it
from
your
hand,
and
put
it
in
the
wastepaper
basket.
indeed,
this
court
averted
to
a
rowan
type
solution.
and
this
court
in
consolidated
edison
pointed
out
that
because
a
speaker
has
alternative
means
of
communication
that
does
not
justify
a
content
based
ban
on
discussion.
the
government
talks
about
a
premailer,
that
youngs
should
make
a
premailer.
well,
part
of
the
power
to
communicate
is
the
power
to
communicate.
if
i
wrote
you
and
said,
i
mean,
how
many
of
those
just
advertisements
do
you
throw
away?
do
you
want
to
learn
more
about
a
cadillac?
do
you
want
to
know
about
an
rca
television?
well,
you
are
not
going
to
pay
attention
unless
you
are
a
particular
buyer.
but
the
government's
solution
of
the
premailer
was
expressly
rejected
by
this
court's
decision
in
lamont
versus
postmaster
general.
now,
i
have
to
add
that
i
don't
understand
how
youngs
would
not
violate
the
statute
and
be
subject
to
five
years
in
the
penitentiary
by
writing
and
saying,
do
you
wish
to
receive
contraceptive
advertisements?
because
i
think
that
is
an
advertisement
unto
itself.
but
assuming
that
i
could
send
a
premailer,
this
court
held
in
lamont
versus
postmaster
general
that
by
requiring
the
addressee
to
do
an
affirmative
act,
you
are
chilling
the
addressee's
first
amendment
rights.
number
two,
under
linmark,
you
are
burdening
youngs's
first
amendment
right,
and
certainly
in
lamont
they
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
less
restrictive
means
available,
namely,
as
under
3008,
the
addressee
could
say
he
or
she
did
not
want
to
receive
the
mail,
and
do
not
send
it
to
any
person
in
the
household
under
the
age
of
19.
in
summary,
we
have
a
content
based
ban
on
speech,
a
ban
on
speech
which
is
speaker
discrimination.
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
planned
parenthood
could
send
these
materials
into
the
home
on
an
unsolicited
basis,
but
youngs
is
barred
from
the
adult
population
of
the
united
states.
i
do
think
that
in
the
year
1983,
with
the
problems
that
beset
our
community,
our
country,
and
the
world,
that
that
type
of
restriction
comes
very
late
in
the
day.
but
certainly
section
3008
solves
the
problem.
if
the
person
doesn't
want
to
use
the
wastebasket
method
of
treatment,
and
i
agree
with
justice
marshall,
we
should
not
presume
that
children
are
going
to
read
the
mail
of
the
parents...
we
are
not
trying...
youngs
is
not
and
did
not
ask
for
the
right
to
send
these
materials
to
minors.
we
want
to
address
and
educate
the
adult
population
of
this
country.
if
the
wastepaper
basket
isn't
enough,
certainly
the
least
tailored
restriction
is
found
under
the
same
title
passed
by
congress
to
address
the
needs
that
the
government
has
suggested
here,
namely,
the
right
under
3008,
approved
by
this
court
in
rowan,
to
say,
send
no
more
mail
of
this
type
to
my
household.
we
ask
that
the
decision
of
judge
penn
in
all
respects
be
affirmed.
