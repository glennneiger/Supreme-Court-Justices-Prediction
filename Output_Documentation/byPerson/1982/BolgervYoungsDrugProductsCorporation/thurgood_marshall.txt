was
there
any
testimony
before
congress
that
it
is
a
usual
thing
that
children
open
their
parents'
mail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
you
are
assuming,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
is
the
basis
for
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
what
would
happen
if
a
child
of
mine
opened
my
mail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
a
child
has
a
right
to
look
at
mail
that
is
not
sealed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
normal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
they
reasonably
conclude
when
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
i
know
of?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
having
any
bases.
justice

you
are
not
going

are
you?

this
case
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
a
federal
statute
which
prohibits
the
mailing
of
unsolicited
advertisements
for
contraceptives.
the
youngs
drug
products
corporation
manufactures
prophylactic
products.
the
company
sought
to
mail
to
the
public
unsolicited
advertisements
promoting
these
products.
the
postal
service
notified
the
company
that
the
mailings
would
violate
federal
law.
the
company
then
brought
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
from
the
district
of
columbia.
the
court
held
that
the
statute
as
applied
to
the
proposed
mailings
violated
the
first
amendment.
the
government
brought
this
appeal.
and
today
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
explained
that
the
company's
advertisements
constitute
commercial
speech
and
that
we
have
held
that
the
constitution
accords
less
protection
to
commercial
speech
than
to
other
constitutionally
safeguarded
forms
of
expression.
however,
because
the
company's
advertisements
concern
lawful
activity
and
are
not
misleading,
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
is
substantial.
the
government
seeks
to
justify
the
prohibition
on
the
mailing
of
the
advertisements
on
two
grounds.
first,
it
argues
that
the
law
shields
recipients
of
mail
from
material
that
they
may
find
offensive.
offensiveness
is
not
normally
an
acceptable
justification
for
suppressing
speech
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and
we
do
not
think
that
it
carries
weight
in
this
case.
recipients
have
objectionable
mailings
can
avoid
the
material
simply
by
averting
their
eyes.
the
short
journey
from
the
mailbox
to
the
trash
can
is
an
acceptable
burden.
the
government
also
contends
that
the
statute
aids
parents'
efforts
to
discuss
birth
control
with
their
children.
while
this
interest
is
a
substantial
one,
the
ban
on
unsolicited
advertisings
provides
only
marginal
assistance
to
parents.
at
the
same
time
it
purges
all
mail
boxes
or
material
that
is
entirely
suitable
for
adults.
the
government
may
not
reduce
the
adult
population
to
reading
only
what
it
sees
fit
with
children.
the
statute
also
restricts
the
free
flow
of
truthful
information
bearing
on
the
ability
of
parents
to
discuss
birth
control
and
to
make
informal
decision.
we
therefore
hold
that
as
applied
to
the
company's
mailings
here,
the
federal
law
violates
the
first
amendment.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
o'connor.
and
justice
stevens
has
filed
--
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
brennan
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
