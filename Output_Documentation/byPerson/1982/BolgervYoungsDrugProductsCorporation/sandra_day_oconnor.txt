do
you
think
that
congress
could
prohibit
the
mailing
of
any
kind
of
junk
mail
without
the
consent
of
the
recipient?
all
kinds,
let's
say?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
in
this
instance
there
are
other
types
of
so-called
potentially
offensive
material
that
could
be
mailed
under
this
statute
and
aren't
prohibited,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
strauss,
would
it
arguably,
at
least,
be
less
restrictive
if
congress
provided
a
means
whereby
any
homeowner
could
say,
don't
mail
to
me
or
to
deliver
to
my
home
anything
related
to
contraceptive
advertisements
or
other
specific
categories?
is
that
less
restrictive,
to
let
people
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
under
this
very
scheme
you
are
offering,
they
have
to
do
something
like
that
for
anyone
under
the
legislation
that
has
already
been
approved
in
some
areas.
mailers
have
to
do
exactly
that.
isn't
that
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
know
why
you
can
argue
that
it
would
be
less
restrictive
than
a
total
ban.
i
am
curious.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
one
of
the
central
hudson
tests,
in
fact?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
strauss,
do
you
concede
that
restrictions
on
commercial
speech
have
to
be
content
neutral?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
congress
go
further
and
say
that
a
homeowner
can
take
his
name
off
the
mailing
list
for
certain
categories
of
items
before
having
received
any
in
that
category?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
realize
that.
i
am
asking
you
whether
you
think
constitutionally
that
could
be
done.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
court
in
cases
such
as
pacifica
foundation,
though,
has
said
that
congress
can
or
the
government
can
prohibit
the
intrusion
of
so-called
offensive
materials
in
the
home.
for
example,
daytime
programming
of
certain
so-called
offensive
programs
on
television,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
congress
has
made
the
judgment
with
respect
to
the
contraceptives
that
that
is
offensive
as
brought
into
the
home.
