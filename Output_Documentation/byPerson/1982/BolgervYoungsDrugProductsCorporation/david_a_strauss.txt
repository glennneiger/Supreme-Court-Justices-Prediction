mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
section
3001(e)(2)
of
title
39
of
the
united
states
code
prohibits
the
mailing
of
unsolicited
advertisements
for
contraceptive
products.
section
3001(e)(2)
does
not
prohibit
any
mailing
that
the
recipient
has
indicated
a
desire
to
receive.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
that
statute
violates
the
first
amendment.
this
action
was
brought
by
the
appellee,
which
has
been
a
manufacturer
of
contraceptive
products
for
some
60
years,
and
is
by
its
own
account
the
leader
in
the
field.
until
1979,
appellee
promoted
its
products
by
means
of
a
sales
force
and
advertisements
in
magazines.
in
1979,
after
what
appellee
describes
as
business
discussions,
appellee
inaugurated
a
new
marketing
strategy
that
included
in
addition
to
its
other
traditional
means
of
advertising
a
campaign
of
mass
unsolicited
mailings
to
members
of
the
general
public
at
large.
the
postal
service
advised
appellee
that
these
mailings
would
violate
section
3001(e)(2),
and
appellee
then
brought
this
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
alleging
that
section
3001(e)(2)
violated
the
constitution,
and
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
the
district
court
found
that
appellee's
mailings
are
commercial
solicitations
and
promotional
materials
in
which
appellee
has
a
commercial
interest.
it
accordingly
declared
that
they
are
commercial
speech,
entitled
to
lesser
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
the
district
court
also
concluded
that
section
3001(e)(2)
directly
furthers
specific
and
important
government
interests.
but
the
district
court
nonetheless
declared
section
3001(e)(2)
unconstitutional
because
it
believed
that
it
could
devise
an
alternative
that,
while
not
protecting
the
government's
interests
quite
as
well,
struck
what
the
district
court
viewed
as
a
better
balance.
that
alternative
was
highly
elaborate.
its
central
feature
was
a
series
of
warnings
in
large
letters
on
the
outside
of
appellee's
unsolicited
mailings.
the
district
court
ordered
its
alternative
into
effect
and
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
section
3001(e)(2).
we
then
brought
this
appeal.
unlike
restrictions
on
commercial
expression
that
this
court
has
invalidated
in
the
past,
section
3001(e)(2)
is
a
narrow
and
specific
limitation,
and
its
effect
on
first
amendment
rights
can
only
be
described
as
minimal.
it
has
no
application
to
any
form
of
non-commercial
speech.
for
that
reason,
organizations
that
advocate
birth
control
or
family
planning
as
a
social
or
moral
matter
are
free
to
do
so
by
using
the
mails,
even
by
using
the
mails
on
an
unsolicited
basis.
section
3001(e)(2)
also
has
no
application
to
a
wide
range
of
advertising,
including
all
the
methods
of
advertising
that
appellee
itself
has
used
so
successfully
for
so
long.
it
does
not
have
any
application
to
advertising
that
does
not
use
the
mail,
and
it
does
not
have
any
application
to
much
advertising
that
does.
for
example,
it
does
not
apply
to
advertisements
in
magazines
or
other
publications
that
are
sent
through
the
mail
so
long
as
the
recipient
has
indicated
a
desire
to
receive
the
publication.
and
it
has
no
application
even
to
unsolicited
advertising
that
is
mailed
to
persons
with
a
professional
interest
in
contraception
such
as
physicians
and
pharmacists
and
dealers.
these
people,
of
course,
particularly
physicians
and
pharmacists,
can
counsel
and
advise
others
on
the
use
of
contraception.
but
most
important,
section
3001(e)(2)
does
not
prevent
any
person
from
receiving
any
of
appellee's
mailings
if
appellee
only
obtains
his
consent,
and
appellee
can
even
use
the
mail
in
an
effort
to
obtain
his
consent,
because
section
3001(e)(2)
as
interpreted
by
the
postal
service
does
not
prohibit
a
premailing
in
which
an
advertiser
asks
a
postal
customer
to
consent
to
receiving
a
line
of
contraceptive
advertisements.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that
may
be
right,
and
i
assume
that
is
why
youngs
drug
is
so
interested
in
sending
unsolicited
mailings,
but
there
is
no
first
amendment
interest
in
forcing
publications
or
information
on
people
who
don't
want
to
receive
it.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
all
kinds
of
commercial
mailings?
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
congress
may
well
have
that
power.
of
course,
such
a
measure
would
present
issues
not
presented
here,
because
it
would
be
far
broader,
and
it
would
answer
to
far
less
specific
government
interests,
but
i
think
congress
may--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--there
are
other...
other
materials
that
don't
pertain
to
contraception
that
could
be
mailed
under
the
statute.
that's
right.
these
premailings
efforts
by
an
advertiser
to
obtain
consent
to
mail
its
products
could
be
a
separate
mailing,
or
they
could
be
a
part
of
another
mailing
advertising
other
products
so
that
the
advertiser
wouldn't
have
to
spend
the
extra
postage,
or
of
course
they
needn't
be
mailed
at
all.
they
could
be
distributed
with
a
product
or
distributed
at
a
drug
store.
the
only
effect
therefore
of
the
statute
that
the
district
court
struck
down
is
to
require
advertisers
like
the
appellee
to
use
some
means,
any
means
to
see
whether
the
persons
to
whom
they
are
sending
their
ads
are
willing
to
receive
them.
at
the
same
time,
as
even
the
district
court
acknowledged,
section
3001(e)(2)
directly
advances
important
government
interests.
first,
parents
can
legitimately
wish
that
if
they
so
desire,
they,
and
not
appellee,
or
some
other
advertiser
trying
to
sell
its
wares,
will
be
the
first
to
introduce
their
children
to
contraception
and
related
subjects.
but
if
unsolicited
advertisements
for
contraception...
for
contraceptive
products
are
allowed
in
the
mails,
it
is
simply
inevitable
that
some
of
them
will
fall
into
the
hands
of
children,
against
the
wishes
of
their
parents.
the
second,
in
the
area
of
commercial
speech,
and
particularly
commercial
speech
that
enters
the
home,
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
expression
on
the
ground
that
it
may
be
offensive
to
its
audience.
it
would
be
a
significant
expansion
and
an
unwarranted
expansion
of
the
protection
the
court
has
accorded
to
commercial
speech
to
say
that
it
cannot
be
regulated
on
the
basis
of
its
offensiveness.
contraception
is
a
subject
of
particular
intimacy
and
privacy
and
delicacy,
so
much
so
that
it
has
a
special
constitutional
status,
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
many
people
will
find
commercial
solicitations
about
such
a
subject
to
be
offensive.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
would
depend
on
whether
the
mailings
constituted
commercial
speech,
which
would
be--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--we
don't
claim
that
such
a
prohibition
could
be
applied
to
non-commercial
speech,
no.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
associated
students,
a
district
court
decision.
that's
right.
the
appellees--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
particular
statute,
of
course,
would
not
achieve
this
purpose,
since
people
would
have
to
certify
that
they
found
these
advertisements
sexually
arousing.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
it
wouldn't
accomplish
the
legislature's
purposes
for
a
number
of
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
of
course,
someone
would
have
to
receive
at
least
one
mailing
from
that
company
before
he
knew
that
he
didn't
want
any
further
mailings
from
that
company,
so
he
would
be
open
to
at
least
one
mailing
from
every
advertiser
for
these
products.
and
second,
that...
such
a
measure
might
very
well
have
the
effect
of
being
a
greater
burden
on
the
values
that
the
first
amendment
is
designed
to
protect
than
the
statute
at
issue
here,
because
presumably
the
advertiser,
which
in
the
case
of
a
drug
company
is
likely
to
have
many
other
items
of
importance
to
advertise,
would
cut
off
all
mailings
to
that
customer.
in
fact,
in
the
statute
you
suggest,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
seems
to
be
precisely
what
it
would
require.
and
since
the
point
of
the
constitutional
protection
for
commercial
expression
is
to
ensure
that
information
reaches
potential
consumers,
such
a
statute
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
that
protection
to
a
large
degree.
and
the
third
thing--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
we
have
two
pieces
of
evidence.
the
first
is
congress's
explicit
statement
in
the
legislative
history
that
contraception
is
a
matter
of
personal
choice,
which
statement
accompanied
the
repeal
of
sweeping
prohibitions
on
the
circulation
of
information
about
contraception
and
the
replacement
of
those
sweeping
prohibitions
with
this
much
more
narrow
and
specific
limitation.
and
the
second,
again,
the
best
possible
evidence
of
congress's
intent,
which
is
the
statute
itself,
permits
unsolicited
mailings
to
persons
like
physicians
and
pharmacists
who
are
in
a
position
to
give
out
advice
to
those
who
seek
it.
the
statute
is
tailored
entirely
to
prevent
commercial
solicitations
from
reaching
those
who
do
not
want
to
receive
them,
while
permitting
the
broadest
possible
circulation
of
information
about
contraception
to
those
who
do
want
to
receive
it.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that
may
be
right,
although
congress
apparently
made
a
judgment
that
the
importance
of
putting
this
information
into
the
hands
of
physicians
so
that
they
could
pass
it
on
was
great
enough,
and
that
physicians
in
their
professional
capacity
would
be
less
likely
to
be
offended
and
less
likely
to
have
children
who
could--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
was
not
an
issue
litigated
below,
but
again,
justice
blackmun,
on
an
issue
like
that,
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
sort
of
evidence
could
be
introduced
in
a
trial
court
that
would
measure
up
to
the
judgment
of
congress,
which
after
all
is
in
an
excellent
position
to
report
on
what
its
constituents
find
offensive.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
it
might
be
possible
for
the
other
side
to
bring
in
100
people...
or
a
gallup
poll.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think...
i
mean,
i
understand
the
point,
justice
blackmun,
but
i
think
the
underlying
question
is
that
the
underlying
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
congress
is
uniquely
well
positioned
to
express
a
judgment
on
a
question
like
what
are
people
likely
to
find
offensive,
and
what
sorts
of
materials
do
people
want
to
keep
out
of
the
hands
of
their
children,
certainly
at
least
as
well
positioned
to
express
a
judgment
on
an
issue
like
that
as
it
is
to
express
a
judgment
on
a
technical
factual
issue
on
which
this
court
would
unhesitatingly
defer
to
it.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
because
it
excludes--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
there
are
a
couple
of
possible
categories
of
material
that
appellees
have
argued
about.
they
have
argued
about
solicited
mailings.
they
have
argued
about
non-commercial
mailings.
as
far
as
non-commercial
mailings
are
concerned,
in
light
of...
by
following
the
logic
of
the
court's
decision
in
metromedia,
or
at
least
the
plurality's
opinion
in
metromedia,
it
is
open
to
congress
simply
to
decide
that
non-commercial
mailings
are
more
valuable,
and
for
that
reason
have
to
be
allowed
even
if
they
are
equally
offensive,
and
equally
likely
to
interfere
with
the
lines
of
communication
between
parents
and
children.
and
beyond
that,
i
think
it
is
quite
reasonable
for
congress
to
say
that
an
effort
by
an
organization
interested
in
the
subject
as
a
moral
matter
to
contribute
to
the
debate
and
enlighten
people
simply
is
less
likely
to
be
the
kind
of
interference
parents
would
want
to
resist
than
the
commercial
solicitations
of
someone
whose
only
interest
is
in
selling
its
products.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
don't
think
it
is.
that,
of
course,
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
hypothetical
statute
that
the
chief
justice
asked
me
about
earlier.
i
don't
think
that's
less
restrictive
even
of
first
amendment
rights.
the
effect
of
that,
apart
from
the
obvious
administrative
burdens
and
the
obvious
problem
that
people
would
have
to
know
to
invoke
that
prerogative
under
the
statute,
even
from
the
point
of
view
of
first
amendment
values,
it
might
very
well
be
that
an
advertiser
or
a
drug
company
would
not
find
it
profitable
to
maintain
two
mailing
lists,
one
a
mailing
list
of
people
who
didn't
want
contraceptive
advertisements,
and
the
other
one
a
mailing
list
of
people
who
did.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
if
they
choose
to
acquire
solicitations.
of
course,
as
long
as
you
are
going
to
protect
the
interest
of
unwilling
recipients
in
not
receiving
these
materials,
two
mailing
lists
would
be
necessary,
but
that
is
why
this...
the
alternative
you
suggest,
justice
o'connor,
might
well
not
be
less
protective
of
first
amendment
rights,
because
it
might
have
the
effect
of
cutting
off
access
to
a
lot
of
other
information,
very
useful
information
about
drugs
to
people
who
want
to
receive
them
but
don't
want
to
receive
contraceptive
advertisements.
also,
i
think
it
was
part
of
congress's--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
it
would
be
less...
well,
it
would
be
more
restrictive
to
the
extent
that
it
would
not
only
keep
people
from
receiving
information
about
contraceptives,
but
also
information
about
other
products
advertised
by
or
manufactured
by
the
same
mailer,
because
that
mailer
might
not
find
it
useful
to
send
out
any...
profitable
to
send
out
any...
efficient
to
send
out
any
advertisements
at
all
to
that
recipient.
also,
i
think
it
was
part
of
congress's
purpose
clearly
to
take
the
burden
off
the
unwilling
recipients
who
don't
want
these
materials
in
their
homes,
and
leave
it
to
be
assimilated
in
the
costs
of
advertising
on
the
advertiser.
i
mean,
it
is
true,
as
appellee
suggests,
that
people
can
do
a
variety
of
things
if
they
don't
want
these
materials
falling
into
the
hands
of
their
children.
they
can
get
a
locked
mailbox,
or
they
can
make
sure
that
they
instead
of
the
children
bring
in
the
mail
every
morning,
or
they
can
carefully
read
through
all
of
this
material
when
it
arrives,
all
their
junk
mail,
as
it
is
known.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
not
that
i
know
of,
justice
marshall,
no.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that's
right.
that's
what
we're
assuming,
but
i
think--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
i
think
that
is
a
sort
of--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
it
is
not
even
so
much
a
matter
of
opening
mail.
a
lot
of
these
materials
are
not
sealed.
there
is
certainly
no
requirement
that
they
be
sealed.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
congress--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
i
think
congress
could
reasonably
conclude
that
it
occurs
in
a
high
enough--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
congress
frequently
reaches
conclusions
as
a
basis
for
legislation
without
having
hearings
or...
like
an
administrative
agency.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
no,
it
doesn't,
at
least--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--no,
but
without
having
a
record
comparable
to
an
administrative
agency,
there
is
no
requirement
that
congress
compile
evidence,
especially,
justice
marshall,
on
a
common
sense
judgment
about
people's
habits
of
living
and
mores
like
this.
this
isn't
a
technical
matter.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
believe--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
actually
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
justice
stevens,
except
i
think
the
flier
was
a
flier.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that
is
one
of
the
things
the
district
court
required,
but
again,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
assurance
that
after
a
sealed
envelope
is
opened,
it
is
not
going
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
child,
or
even--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
if
they
know
that
it
is
contraceptive
advertising,
of
course,
if
they
don't
want
their
children
to
get
it,
they
will
dispose
of
it
promptly,
but
a
lot
of
these
materials
come
into
the
home
in
large
quantity,
advertisements
of
various
kinds,
mixed
in
with
various
other
sorts
of
mail,
and
they
may
come
into
the
home
when
the
parents
aren't
there.
the
parents
may
not
even
know
that
it
is
coming
into
the
home.
i
suspect--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
the
district
court
noted,
as
this
court
did
in
rowan,
that
this
mail
arrives
in,
i
think
the
term
is
avalanche
proportions.
that
is,
unsolicited
commercial
mailings.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
in
instances--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think
that's
right,
and
i
think
for
some
of
the
same
reasons
that
the
court
has
said
overbreadth
does
not
apply
to...
the
overbreadth
doctrine
does
not
apply
to
commercial
speech,
there
is
good
reason
not
to
apply
the
less
restrictive
alternative
approach
as
vigorously.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
court
has
said
that
on
occasion,
but
always
in
the
context
of
emphasizing
that
the
basic
question
is
whether
the
intrusion
into
first
amendment
values
is
justified
by
the
government
interests
at
stake.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
that's
a
case
where
it
was
mentioned,
although
there
have
been
other
cases
in
which
the
court
didn't
place
as
much
emphasis
on
it.
it
is
really
a
question,
of
course,
of
what
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
present.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
am
sorry?
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
when
offensiveness
is
an
asserted
justification
for
a
statute,
the
court
has
to
scrutinize
what
congress
has
done
to
some
degree
to
make
sure
that
it
is
at
least
a
common
sense
judgment.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
don't
know--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
don't
know
if
it's
possible
to
distinguish
among
kinds
of
offensiveness
on
their
psychological
bases.
maybe
i
can
answer
your
question
this
way,
justice
stevens.
if
there
were
an
indication
that
the
legislature
were
acting
out
of
antipathy
to
a
particular
point
of
view--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--no,
i
don't
think
we
do.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
he
certainly
was,
but
most
of--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--it
was
survival
after
most
of
his
handiwork
and
certainly
the
parts
he
would
have
considered
vastly
more
important
were
repealed
in
1971.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
there
are
a
variety
of
things
that
might
be
offensive.
some
people
might
simply
object...
are
likely
simply
to
object
to
any
commercial
treatment
of
a
subject
of
such
importance
and
intimacy.
some
people
might
find
that...
the
very
fact
of
commercial
treatment
of
it
a
corruption
of
the
subject,
even
if
they
are
very
much
in
favor
of
the
practice
of
contraception.
had
congress
wanted
to
discourage
people
from
practicing
contraception,
or
to
restrict
the
flow
of
information
so
that
people
would
be
less
likely
to
practice
contraception,
it
is
unthinkable
that
congress
would
have
done
what
it
did
when
it
passed
this
statute,
which
is
to
sweep
away
all
of
the
most
important
restrictions
on
the
circulation
of
information.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
it
only
restricts
the
flow
of
information
to
people
who
are
unwilling
to
receive
it.
any
person
who
wants
to
receive
it
will
receive
it.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
if
appellee
is
willing
to
seek
a
solicitation,
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
obviously,
fewer
people
would
receive
it
than
if
they
sent
it
out
directly.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
out
of
the
commercial
area,
it
might
well
be,
because
out
of
the
commercial
area
it
is
not
only
the
informational
value
and
the
value
to
willing
recipients
that
matters.
planned
parenthood
might
want
to
express
itself
on
the
subject,
but
in
the
commercial
area,
the
court's
decisions
make
it
plain
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
interest
in
forcing
information
on
unwilling
recipients.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
that
the
importance
of
the
protection
of
first
amendment...
of
commercial
speech
is
based
on
its
informational
function.
the
court
said
that
in
central
hudson.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
in
consolidated
edison--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
will
save
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think
the
application
of
that
rule
of
mosely
and
carey
against
brown
and
cases
like
that
to
commercial
speech
is
different.
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
fact
that
advertising
for
one
product
is
regulated
differently
from
advertising
for
another
product
does
not
constitute
a
content
based
restriction
that
requires
special
scrutiny.
otherwise,
congress
would
have
to
apply
the
same
regulations
to
groceries
as
it
does
to
used
cars,
and
the
court's
decisions
have
never
suggested
that.
thank
you.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
there
is
a
sense
in
which
it
distinguishes
between
speech
of
one
content
and
speech
of
another,
but
it
cannot
be
the
case
that
that
distinction
requires
a
higher
level
of
scrutiny
or
makes
the
statute
suspect.
otherwise,
the
legislature
would
be
handcuffed,
and
the
court's
decisions
from
virginia
pharmacy
on
down
have
made
it
clear
that
the
legislature
can
keep
in
mind
the
practicalities
of
regulating
different
sorts
of
advertising
in
different
ways.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
three
points.
first,
this
statute
was
passed
in
the
1970's,
not
the
1870's.
when
it
was
passed,
congress
swept
away
all
restrictions
on
mailings,
non-commercial
mailings,
all
restrictions
on
solicited
commercial
mailings,
and
many
important
restrictions
on
unsolicited
commercial
mailings,
and
congress
did
so
while
it
was
avowing
that
contraception
is
a
matter
of
individual
personal
choice.
i
would
also
point
out
that
in
1970,
when
congress
considered
and
passed
the
statute,
it
was
five
years
before
bigelow
and
six
years
before
virginia
pharmacy.
at
that
time
it
was
black
letter
law
that
all
commercial
speech
could
be
regulated
without
regard
to
the
first
amendment,
and
had
congress
wanted
to
come
as
close
as
it
could
to--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--from
valentine
against
christianson,
the
first--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
it
was
so
considered
in
1970.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
by
all
the
lower
courts,
and
presumably
by
congress
had
it
wanted
to
see
it
close
to
the
line,
justice
blackmun.
we
all
recognize
the
validity
of
subsequent
criticisms,
but
even
in
pittsburgh
plate
glass
in
1973,
the
court
still
treated
valentine
against
christianson
as
the
law.
had
congress
wanted
to
suppress
as
much
information
about
contraception
as
it
possibly
could
have
or
had
it
wanted
to
act
out
of
antipathy
to
contraception,
it
would
have...
it
would
not
have
eliminated
so
many
restrictions
on
commercial
expression
as
it
did.
second,
lamont,
which
was
just
introduced
now
by
appellee,
involved...
required...
the
statute
in
that
case
required
a
willing
recipient
to
acknowledge
to
the
government
that
he
wanted
to
receive
political
mailings
that
the
government
had
declared
to
be
subversive.
that
is
obviously
worlds
removed
from
a
premailing
to
a
private
advertiser
in
this
case.
third,
appellee
insists
that
he
doesn't
want
to
send
these
to
unwilling
recipients,
or
so
it
seems.
and
that
this
problem
could
be
constitutionally
solved
by
allowing
unwilling
recipients
to
cut
off
the
mailings.
if
that
is
right,
then
the
only
question
in
this
case
is,
who
is
going
to
bear
the
burden?
does
an
unwilling
recipient
have
to
buy
a
locked
mailbox
or
make
an
extra
trip
to
the
post
office,
certify
that
these
materials
are
sexually
arousing
and
erotically
provocative,
closely
monitor
his
mail,
or
do
something
else,
or
does
an
advertiser
who
is
already
engaged
in
continual
mass
mailings
and
is
in
the
business
of
reaching
the
public
and
finding
out
what
the
public
thinks,
does
the
advertiser
just
have
to
take
some
measure,
at
most
one
additional
mailing,
to
see
if
the
persons
to
whom
he
is
sending
his
advertisements
are
willing
to
receive
them?
thank
you.
