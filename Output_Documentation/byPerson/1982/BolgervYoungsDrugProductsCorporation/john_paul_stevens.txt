justice
john
paul
stevens
your
view
is...
i
know
the
statute
permits
it,
but
supposing
the
statute
prohibited
the
mailing
of
its
promotional
material
by
a
charitable
foundation
or
something
like
planned
parenthood.
do
you
think
congress
could
constitutionally
prohibit
it
on
the
same
grounds,
that
it
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
children?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
am
really
asking
you
is,
if
you
get
out
of
the
commercial
speech
category,
do
you
think
the
statute
would
stand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
you
acquiesced
in
a
holding
in
some
other
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
strauss,
on
the
exhibits
in
the
record,
anyway,
they
were
all
inside
envelopes,
weren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
pamphlets
certainly
couldn't
have
been
just
sent...
the
promotional
materials.
at
least,
just
my
impression
would
be
you've
got
to
get
an
address
on
somewhere.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
one
with
all
the
different
products.
but
if
that
is
the
problem,
justice
o'connor
suggested
one
less
restrictive
means
may
be
just
to
require
them
to
send
them
in
sealed
envelopes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
people
who
consider
it
offensive
and
are
concerned
about
their
children
getting
it
are
not
the
ones
who
are
apt
to
put
it
on
the
dining
room
table
in
a
prominent
place,
are
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
most
people
get
more
mail
than
i
do.

mr.
strauss,
does
the
reason
why
the
material
is
offensive
bear
on
the
issue
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
reason
why
the
material
is
offensive
bear
on
the
issue
at
all?
in
other
words,
supposing
someone
is
a
christian
scientist,
doesn't
believe
in
using
drugs
in
any
kind.
could
you
say,
well,
because
of
that
potential
for
offending
a
person
of
that
religious
faith,
we
will
have
a
statute
prohibiting
the
advertising
of
any
kind
of
pharmaceutical
products?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
have
to
be
a
viewpoint
neutral
kind
of
offensiveness,
or
can
the
offensiveness
lie
in
the
fact
that
there
are
many
people
who
as
a
matter
of
religious
faith
don't
believe
contraceptives
should
be
used?
is
that
the
kind
of
offensiveness
we
are
talking
about,
or
is
it
there
is
something
about
the
human
body
that
is
referred
to
that
makes
it
offensive?
what
is
it
that
makes
this
offensive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
permissively
offensive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
do
have
that
history
here,
don't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
comstock
act,
the
history
of
that
that
this
gentleman
was
very
much
opposed
to
the
use
of
these
products?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
the
survival
of
that
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
what
is
offensive
about
this
material
other
than
the
aspects
of
it
that
mr.
comstock
thought
were
offensive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
even
what
remains
certainly
restricts
the
flow
of
information
on
this
subject,
does
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how?
by
writing
in
and
saying,
i
want
some
junk
mail?
didn't
justice
rehnquist
answer
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
this
were
not
commercial
mail,
say
it
were,
again,
planned
parenthood,
do
you
think
that
if
they
sent
out
a
flier
saying,
we
would
like
to
mail
you
a
pamphlet
about
contraceptives
if
you
send
in
and
say
you
want
to
receive
it,
do
you
think
there
would
be
the
same
audience
receiving
it
as
if
they
just
sent
it
out
directly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
permissible
restraint?
say
we
get
out
of
the
commercial
area
again.
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
permissible
restraint
to
say
all
promotional
materials
by
a
charitable
organization
must
first
get
the
consent
of
the
recipient?
would
that
be
an
abridgement
of
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
did
we
say
that,
that
no
first
amendment--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
central
hudson,
weren't
there...
those
two
cases
that
came
down,
weren't
there
people
in
the
audience
there
who
the
court
assumed
didn't
particularly
want
the
material.
it
was
offensive
to
them.
nevertheless
the
utility
was
permitted
to
send
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
consolidated
edison,
i
guess.
--it
was
not
commercial
speech,
and
in
central
hudson
it
wasn't
anything
that--
--consolidated
edison
is
the
one
i
am
thinking
of.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
that
is
true.
supposing
they
thought
it
was
unhealthy
to
smoke,
and
they
singled
out
cigarettes,
and
say,
we
won't
have
any
cigarette
mailings
advertising
cigarettes.
do
you
think
that
would
be
impermissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
that
there
was
a
legitimate
governmental
interest
in
discouraging
smoking,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
proper,
but
i
would
suppose
you
would
have
suggested
there
is
not
such
a
legitimate
governmental
interest
with
regard
to
contraception.
