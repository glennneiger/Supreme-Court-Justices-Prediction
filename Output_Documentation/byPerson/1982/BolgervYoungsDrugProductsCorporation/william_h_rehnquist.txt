justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
in
the
real
world,
i
suppose
that
when
you
are
asking
for
what
is
basically
consent
to
receive
junk
mail,
most
people
would
say,
no,
i
don't
want
to
receive
it,
whereas
if
they
could
send
it
directly,
there
is
some
chance,
i
suppose,
that
the
advertisement
might
sell
them
on
getting
the
stuff.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
finding
of
a
district
court
in
another
case
certainly
isn't
binding
on
the
government
in
this
case.
do
you
contend
otherwise?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
do
put
it
forth
in
this
case.
what
point
do
you
seek
to
draw
from
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
certainly
make
that
point
without
relying
on
the
findings
of
a
district
judge
in
some
other
case,
can't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
was
the
moral
judgment
of
congress
at
that
time,
was
it
not?
