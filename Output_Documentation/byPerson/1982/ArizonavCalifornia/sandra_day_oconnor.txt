were
the
boundaries
in
dispute,
all
those
that
had
federal
lands
on
one
side
and
tribal
lands
on
the
other?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
any
actions
been
filed
by
the
states
separately
to
contest
the
boundaries
as
determined
by
the
secretary
of
interior?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
states
don't
claim
any
interest
in
the
land
itself.
you
are
concerned
only
with
the
water
rights
attached
to
it
which
might
change
because
of
the
boundary
change.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra

o'connor
--counsel,
you
didn't
refer
to
the
case
of
maryland
versus
louisiana
in
connection
with
this
intervention
issue.
did
you
think
that
case
was
one
that
has
some
relevance
for
our
purposes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hunsaker,
to
what
extent
does
the
larger
amount
of
practically
irrigable
acreage
found
by
the
present
special
master
come
from
examining
new
technology?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
that
land
that
couldn't
be
irrigated
by
other
traditional
methods
that
were
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
previous
decree?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hunsaker,
if
the
court
were
to
determine
that
the
omitted
lands
issue
recommendation
of
the
new
special
master
is
erroneous,
would
the
court
then
have
to
remand
on
any
question
of
conflict
of
interest
as
far
as
the
tribes
are
concerned?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think,
mr.
claiborne,
that
that
language
would
normally
be
used
to
aid
the
parties
in
the
event
of
some
substantial
change
in
the
supply
of
water
in
the
river,
or
something
of
that
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
rather
than
to
reopen
it
for
issues
which
were
litigated
by
the
parties
at
the
time
of
the
original
decree?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
claiborne,
has
it
been
finally
resolved
as
to
the
fort
mojave
reservation
as
well?
