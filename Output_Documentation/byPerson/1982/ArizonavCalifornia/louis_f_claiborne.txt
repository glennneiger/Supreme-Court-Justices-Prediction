mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
before
turning
to
the
boundary
lines,
it
might
be
useful
to
say
one
or
two
words
in
addition
to
what
has
been
said
by
mr.
aschenbrenner
about
the
omitted
lands
question.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
recognize
that
article
ix
of
the
decree
in
this
case
is
specific
in
allowing
amendment
and
modification.
the
word
"modification"
when
the
provision
was
referred
to
was
omitted
by
the
state
parties.
it
is
that
word
on
which
we
rely.
now,
that
term,
"modification",
is
not
the
common
standard
provision
in
the
original
decrees
of
this
court.
it
is,
on
the
contrary,
a
special
form
of
words
which
is
common
to
water
decrees,
including
the
water
decrees
of
this
court
in
interstate
cases,
such
as
wisconsin
versus
illinois
and
new
jersey
versus
new
york,
cited
by
the
special
master.
in
the
ordinary
original
case
in
which
this
court
retains
jurisdiction,
such
as
the
off-shore
cases,
beginning
with
the
louisiana
and
texas
cases,
the
order
retaining
jurisdiction
is
far
more
restrictive.
in
those
cases,
for
instance,
it
read,
"jurisdiction
is
reserved
by
this
court
to
enter
such
further
orders
and
to
issue
such
further
writs
as
may
from
time
to
time
be
deemed
advisable
or
necessary
to
give
full
force
and
effect
to
this
decree.
"
not
to
bury
this
decree,
not
to
modify
this
decree.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
o'connor,
that--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--justice
o'connor,
certainly
such
provisions
do
typically
address
the
question
of
changed
circumstances,
and
for
that
reason
they
are
appropriate
in
order
decrees
where
predictability
is
not
always
as
certain
as
it
might
be,
but
it
also
authorizes
here
the
correction
we
suggest
of
mistakes
and
omissions,
at
least
if
they
can
be
shown
to
be
of
sufficient
magnitude
to
justify
the
exercise
of
the
court's
discretion.
for
the
moment,
i
am
only
speaking
of
the
power
which
the
court
retained
to
reopen.
whether
the
court
as
a
matter
of
discretion
ought
to
exercise
that
power
is
a
different
question.
i
want
to
say
one
more
thing
about
article
ix.
it
was
not
an
inadvertent
provision
that
was
slipped
in
at
the
last
moment
without
anyone's
noticing.
it
was
a
provision
written
by
the
special
master
himself
in
his
draft
decree
in
may
of
1960,
this
same
special
master
who
had
held
the
united
states
to
making
all
its
claims,
and
who
had
indicated
a
reluctance
to
be
ready
to
reopen,
but
perhaps
not
too
surprisingly,
although
the
special
master
pushed
the
government
attorneys
as
far
as
he
could
to
making
their
full
claim,
warned
them
that
reopening
was
a
closed
door;
nevertheless,
when
coming
to
writing
his
decree,
perhaps
thought
to
himself,
i
must,
notwithstanding
having
pressed
the
government
to
making
its
full
claim,
allow
for
the
event
that
i
or
they
had
made
an
error
which
justice
requires
to
be
corrected
at
some
later
date.
it
will,
of
course,
be
in
the
lap
of
the
court
to
determine
whether
that
application
will
fail
or
not,
but
i
ought
not
wholly
close
the
door.
that
provision
written
by
the
special
master
in
may
of
1960,
circulated
to
the
parties.
briefs
were
written
commenting
upon
the
decree,
commenting
upon
the
report.
oral
hearings
were
held
in
new
york
for
three
days
before
the
special
master,
before
he
finalized
his
report
and
recommended
decrees.
in
none
of
those
proceedings
was
any
suggestion
made
that
article
ix
ought
to
be
narrowed,
specifically,
narrowed
so
as
to
prevent
a
reopening
of
the
indian
allocations.
no
word
of
that
in
any
of
these
briefs,
in
any
of
these
hearings.
the
matter
this
master
adhered
to
his
recommended
decree
in
this
respect.
article
ix
remained
unchanged,
and
that
report
was
submitted
to
this
court.
this
court
received
the
report
in
december
of
1960,
and
did
not
decide
the
case
until
june
of
1963.
in
the
interval,
there
were
hundreds
of
pages
of
briefs.
there
were
two
lengthy
oral
arguments
in
this
court,
and
during
all
of
that
time,
no
party
suggested
that
article
ix
had
been
drawn
too
widely,
too
broadly.
on
the
contrary,
the
only
party
to
speak
to
article
ix
was
the
imperial
irrigation
district,
insisting
upon
it
as
the
way
of
preventing
any
claim
of
res
judicata
should
a
mistake
have
occurred
and
correction
be
appropriate.
at
all
events,
the
court
issued
its
opinion
in
june
of
1963,
and
then
allowed
the
parties
further
time
in
which
to
prepare
a
decree
modifying
that
which
the
master
had
suggested
in
light
of
the
court's
opinion.
that,
of
course,
resulted
in
further
briefing.
one
of
the
provisions
that
was
submitted
to
this
court
as
an
agreed
provision
of
the
decree
was
article
ix,
and
as
i
say,
no
one
during
this
further
period
once
again
suggested
any
narrowing
of
that
provision.
in
that
light,
it
seems
to
us
we
are
entitled
to
read
article
ix
to
mean
what
it
says,
and
it
does
say
that
a
modification
may
be
made.
now,
we
don't
suggest
that
the
court
was
inviting
the
parties
to
rehear
the
legal
principles
on
which
the
case
had
been
decided.
we
do
suggest
that
the
court
indicated
its
willingness
to
entertain
an
application
for
a
factual
error
that
had
been
made
in
the
case.
let
me
say
one
other
thing
about
the
omitted
lands
claim.
the
fear
has
been
expressed
that
if--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--justice
white,
i
make
two
answers,
or
perhaps
three.
first,
the
court
has
retained
power
to
do
precisely
as
suggested.
it
would
be
most
unusual
for
the
court
to
invite
a...
what
is
in
effect
a
rehearing
of
the
legal
standard
on
which
the
court
decided
the
case
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
so,
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
should
have
said
parenthetically
that
i
do
not
concede
that
there
is
presently
from
this
court
any
different
standard
with
respect
to
the
measurement
of
water
properly
allocated
to
indian
reservations.
on
the
contrary,
as
late
as
1979,
this
court
in
effect
in
its
decree
reaffirmed
the
continuing
application
of
the
practically
irrigable
standard.
the
court
entered
a
decree
which
specified
water
rights
on
that
basis,
and
it
expressly
provided
that
with
respect
to
any
boundaries
that
were
finally
determined,
allocations
of
water
should
be
based
on
precisely
the
same
formula.
therefore,
the
court
itself
has
reaffirmed
the
application
of
that
standard
in
this
case
as
recently
as
three
years
ago.
let
me
say
with
respect
to
the
fear
that
if
the
case
is
reopened
now
for
this
purpose,
other
applications
may
be
made
to
the
court
at
some
future
date
with
respect
to
other
matters
or
indeed
on
behalf
of
the
tribes
for
still
more
water,
with
respect
to
the
last,
i
would
say
that
for
our
part
we
would
not
have
the
courage
to
come
before
the
court
to
apply
again.
at
that
time,
latches
reliance
would
indeed
be
an
effective
bar
against
our
application,
but
finally,
the
court
is
free,
and
we
invite
it
to
do
so,
to
specify
in
its
decree
at
the
end
of
this
case
a
different
article
ix,
a
modification
of
article
ix
which
closes
the
door.
the
court
is
perfectly
free
to
say,
we
will
no
longer
entertain
a
modification
after
this
case
is
finally
closed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
rehnquist,
i
cannot
say
the
court
is
not
free.
i
must
say
that
to
so
construe
article
ix
would
be
to
strain
its
words.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
i
may
turn
to
the
question
of
boundaries,
i
should
say
first
that
the
boundary
adjustments
in
this
case
would
entitle
the
tribes
with
respect
to
the
acreage
which
had
been
restored
to
their
reservations
to
a
total
of
about
127,000
acre
feet
of
diversions
from
the--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--mr.
justice
white,
no.
we
say
that
the
secretary
and
some
supreme
court
judgments
have
determined
what
the
original
boundaries
were.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
restoring
in
the
factual
sense
that
these
areas
had
been
deprived
of
reservation
status
in
the
interim,
and
now
they
have
been
restored
to
their
reservation
status--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--most
importantly,
by
being
deprived
of
allocation
of
water.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
department
of
the
interior
had
been
ambiguous
about
the
status
of
these
boundary
lands,
and
so
master
rifkind
found.
indeed,
his
disallowance
of
the
boundary
claims
which
were
advanced
by
the
lawyers
in
litigation
on
behalf
of
the
department
of
justice
was
in
part
premised
on
the
fact
that
the
interior
department
had
been
ambivalent
in
its
characterization
of
the
contested
lands,
and
he
found
no
final
or
formal
or
clear
ruling
from
the
land
department
as
to
these
areas
being
included
within
the
reservation,
and
accordingly,
thought
himself
free
to
decide
the
matter
for
himself.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
white,
no,
the--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--the
problem
before
was
that
there
were
solicitor's
opinions
looking
one
way,
and
there
were
other
administrative
actions
looking
the
other
way.
this
court
from
its
study
of
disestablishment
cases
is
familiar
enough
with
the
ambiguities
that
can
arise
from
maps
which
show
one
thing
and
rulings
which
show
another,
and
sometimes
inconsistent
rulings.
now,
at
the
highest
level,
the
department
of
the
interior,
after
full
consideration,
has
formally,
finally,
and
unambiguously
determined
what
the
true
boundaries
of
each
of
these
reservations
is.
nothing
ambivalent
about
the
present
status.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
have
no
reason
to
anticipate
such
a
change,
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
has,
justice
o'connor.
now,
no
one
questions
that
this
function
of
determining,
of
defining
the
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation
is
one
peculiarly
left
to
the
department
of
the
interior,
that
department
which
has
a
special
responsibility
with
respect
to
the
public
lands
of
the
united
states,
and
also
a
special
responsibility
with
respect
to
indian
affairs.
at
least
those
formal
administratively
final
decisions
of
the
department
of
the
interior
are
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
correctness,
and
they
must
be
given
effect
until
and
unless
the
court
with
jurisdiction
sets
them
aside,
or
until
and
unless
they
are
administratively
set
aside,
which
is
an
occurrence
not
to
be
anticipated.
for
all
other
purposes,
these
boundaries
have
been
treated
as
final
and
fixed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
stevens,
i
say
at
least
they
are
presumptively
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
don't
have
to,
justice
stevens,
i
think,
take
the
position
that
they
are
not
subject
to
challenge
in
the
judicial
proceeding
elsewhere.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
for
the
time
being,
they
are
presumptively
correct
and
must
be
given
effect
for
that
because
administrative
decisions
in
the
absence
of
a
vacation
by
a
court
are
entitled
to--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--we
do
say,
justice
stevens,
that
in
this
proceeding,
in
this
court,
in
light
of
the
court's
own
ruling
in
1973,
there
is
no
occasion
to
review
these
decisions.
that
does
not
mean
that
the
state
parties
will
in
other
forums
be
deprived
of
an
opportunity
to
challenge.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
white,
as
was
correctly
stated,
i
think,
by
mr.
boronkay,
the
united
states
has
in
the
proceeding
filed
in
the
southern
district
of
california
submitted
a
motion
to
dismiss
alleging--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
hope
i
do
not
have
to...
i
disown
the
motion
to
dismiss
which
has
been
filed
by
the
united
states
in
the
district
court.
whether
that...
all
of
those
defenses
or
some
of
them
will
prevail
in
that
court
is
something
which--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--yes,
we
would.
and...
we
would,
assuming
that
that
decision
had
survived
appeal
or
had
not
been
appealed,
and
had
had
sustained
our
motion
to
dismiss,
we
would
rest
on
the
correctness
of
that
ruling,
and
there
is
much
law
to
the
effect
that--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
appreciate
that.
i
appreciate
that
that
is
so,
though
we
invite
the
court
to
follow
the
indications
of
its
prior
decision
with
respect
to
these
boundary
questions,
remembering
this.
were
it
not
for
the
decree
of
this
court
in
1964,
water
would
presently
be
allocated
to
these
boundary
lands
because
there
are
final
determinations
administratively
as
to
these
boundaries,
and
because
those
lands
have
been
determined
to
be
irrigable.
this
court
enjoined
the
secretary
from
granting
water
to
such
lands
until
either
there
was
an
agreement
of
the
parties
or
this
court
itself
entered
a
further
decree.
what
this
court
did
not
suggest,
indeed,
suggested
to
the
contrary,
was
that
this
court
would
also
review
these
administrative
boundary
determinations.
on
the
contrary,
as
the
court
well
knows,
at
its
previous
hearing,
the
court
determined
that
the
special
master
had
wrongly
in
its
name
sought
to
determine
the
boundaries.
the
court
said
that
that
matter
would
not
be
decided
here,
and
even
suggested
that
the
secretary
was
free
to
allocate
water
in
the
interim.
the
decree
for
some
reason
was
inconsistent
with
the
opinion
in
this
respect,
and
on
the
contrary,
instructed
the
secretary
not
to
deliver
water
to
these
contested
boundary
areas
until
they
had
been
finally
determined,
in
which
event
an
application
must
be
made
to
this
court
to
obtain
water
for
such
irrigable
acreage
as
was
found
there.
that
is
why
we
came
to
this
court,
in
obedience
to
the
1964
decree.
we
came
late,
in
part
because
we
wished
to
only
come
once.
we
waited
until
all
the
boundary
determinations
had
been
finalized,
and
indeed,
as
the
court
knows,
in
one
case
the
finalization
occurred
the
day
before
we
filed
our
motion.
we
did
not
delay
once
we
had
in
hand
the
final
decisions
of
the
secretary.
certainly
the
court
did
not
suggest
on
the
last
occasion
that
the
united
states
must
go
out
and
get
judicial
vindication
of
secretarial
orders.
that
would
indeed
be
most
unusual.
those
orders
are
final.
this
court
has
indicated
that
it
need
not
review
them,
and
for
good
reason.
this
court
is
not
normally
charged
in
original
cases
with
reviewing
administrative
findings
of
this
kind.
if
there
are
appropriate
proceedings
which
can
be
had
in
some
other
court,
and
if
a
challenge
in
some
other
court
should
disallow
any
of
these
boundary
adjustments,
no
harm
will
be
done
if
in
the
meantime
the
water
is
allocated.
the
recommended
decree
provides
that
in
the
event
that
any
boundary
determination
is
upset
judicially,
the
allocation
made
to
that
extent
shall
be
diminished.
the
formula
is
clear.
there
will
be
no
need
to
reapply
to
this
court.
now
that
the
matter
is
before
the
court,
we
urge
the
court
not
to
be
sidetracked
by
a
suit
belatedly
filed
after
the
close
of
the
evidence
before
the
master
in
the
southern
district
of
california,
but
to
take
this
opportunity
to
at
long
last
allocate
the
water
that
has
for
many
years
properly
been
attributable
to
the
boundary
lands
of
these
tribes.
the
court
ought
not
be
asked
to
postpone
its
rulings,
and
the
tribes
ought
not
be
asked
to
postpone
their
entitlement
to
this
boundary
land
any
further.
with
the
exceptions
which
are
not
controversial
filed
by
the
united
states,
we
urge
the
court
to
approve
in
all
respects
the
recommendations
of
the
special
master.
