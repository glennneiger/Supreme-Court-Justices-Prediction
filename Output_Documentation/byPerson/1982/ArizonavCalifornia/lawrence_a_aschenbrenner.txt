mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
tribes
relied
on
the
government's
brief
on
the
boundary
dispute
issue,
and
so
i
intend
to
defer
that
question
to
mr.
claiborne,
and
proceed
with
the
question
of
the
omitted
lands
and
the
other
issues
raised
by
counsel
for
the
states.
the
states
say
that
the
1964
decree
can't
be
reopened
because,
one,
res
judicata
bars
it,
two,
article
ix
does
not
authorize
it,
and
three,
the
law
of
the
case
precludes
it.
we
say
they
are
mistaken
on
all
three
grounds.
first,
res
judicata
only
applies
to
a
subsequent
case
between
the
same
parties
in
the
same
cause
of
action,
a
different
case.
this
is
the
same
case.
second,
article
ix
by
its
express
terms
certainly
authorizes
any
change
whatsoever.
and
third,
we
say
the
law
of
the
case
does
not
bar
reopening
where
there
has
been
a
gross
error
which
the
states
admit,
where
this
error
has
caused
manifest
injustice
to
one
of
the
parties,
and
there
has
been
no
significant
showing
of
detrimental
reliance
upon
the
other
party.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
say
that
because
they
admitted
that
80
percent
of
the
land
claimed
by
the
united
states
is
practicably
irrigable
today
and
50
percent
of
the
combined
claims
of
the
tribes
in
the
united
states
are
irrigable
today,
and
that
is
what
their
experts
admitted
in
trial.
now,
in
their
briefs
and
in
this
oral
argument,
they
are
contending
that
a
major
portion
of
that
land
would
not
have
been
irrigable
at
the
original
trial,
but
it
is
today,
but
the
fact
is,
and
the
record
shows,
that
the
only
change
in
technology
that
appears
in
the
record
concerns
drip
irrigation,
and
drip
irrigation
the
states'
experts
contended
could
be
substituted
and
replaced
with,
if
it
didn't
work
properly,
sprinkler
irrigation.
well,
sprinkler
irrigation
was
available
during
the
original
trial.
the
only
difference
in
standard
between
the
original
trial
and
the
present
trial
was
the
use
of
the
soil
conservation
service
standards
with
respect
to
sandy
lands.
that
is
only
1,750
acres.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
no,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
way,
and
special
master
tuttle
didn't
put
it
that
way.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
all
that
the
tribes
are
asking
for
is
to
apply
the
same
standard
that
was
applied
in
the
original
case,
practicably
irrigable
acres
standard
to
determine
what
water
should
be
allocated.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
your
honor,
we
are
not
merely
saying
that
hindsight,
that
now
because
of
hindsight
it
is
apparent
they
made
a
mistake.
it
is
apparent
from
the
prior
record
before
judge
rifkind
that
the
methodology
was
totally
flawed.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
not
in
the
usual
case
that
was
15
years
old,
your
honor.
what
we
have
to
look
at
is
the
timing
of
the
tribe's
motion
in
perspective
of
this
entire
case,
and
we
have
to
look
to
see
what
has
happened
to
change
the
situation
between
1964
and
today.
i
assume
that
if
the
tribes
have
discovered
the
error,
and
the
united
states
had,
and
made
the
motion
in
1965,
nobody
would
claim
that
this
grievous
error
shouldn't
have
been
corrected.
but
so
what
has
materially
happened
in
the--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--well,
i
suppose
one
thing
it
gets
back
to,
your
honor,
is
article
ix,
which
expressly
provides
for
reopening.
contrary
to
the
state's
position
that
it
only
applies
to
equitable
apportionment
cases,
this
provision
was
submitted
by
the
imperial
irrigation
district
for
the
express
purpose
of
avoiding
a
claim
of
res
judicata
against
the
united
states,
and
to
correct
any
error
that
the
united
states
might
suggest
to
the
court
had
occurred--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--pardon
me.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
and
they
submitted
this,
your
honor,
on
january
11th,
1963,
long
after
the
issue
of
equitable
apportionment
went
out
of
the
case.
and
all
the
parties
agreed
to
it.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
no,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
you
can
only
justify
reopening
under
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine,
which
is
this
case...
we
are
trying
to
reopen
the
same
case...
if
you
can
find
a
gross
error,
where
the
other
party
had
not
changed
his
position
and
relied
to
his
detriment,
and
as
i
will
point
out
in
a
minute,
none
of
the
three
parties
which
claimed
to
show
reliance
demonstrated
it
in
the
record.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
right,
your
honor.
well,
the
gross
error...
take
the
chemehuevi
tribe,
for
example.
the
government
only
asserted
and
was
awarded
a
little
fraction
better
than
one-half
of
the
irrigable
acreage
which
judge
tuttle
found
to
be
practically
irrigable
lands.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
well,
as
judge
tuttle
pointed
out,
the
indians
weren't
even
there
by
their
own
attorney.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
they
were
there
by
the
government.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
they
are...
well,
now,
heckman
didn't
discuss
the
issue
of
whether
or--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--i...
yes,
we
allege
inadequate
representation,
and
we
stick
by
that.
we--
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
--no,
but
he
didn't
find
against
us.
in
footnote
71
of
his
report,
he
expressly
found
it
unnecessary
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
conflict
or
whether
the
conflict
of
interest
prevented
the
tribes
from
being
bound,
citing
hansberry
versus
lee,
because
he
found
we
had
a
right
to
reopen
under
article
ix,
so
he
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
inadequacy
of
representation.
and
under
article
ix,
we
are
not
compelled
to
show
inadequacy
of
representation
under
due
process
grounds.
we
merely
have
to
show,
as
judge
tuttle
found,
a
grievous
error,
lack
of
detrimental
reliance.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
no,
i
would
say
you
couldn't,
your
honor.
as
judge
tuttle
said,
you
only
reopen
the
decree
where
there
is
good
cause
therefore.
there
is
no
good
cause
to
change
the
practicably
irrigable
acreage
standard.
the
same
policy
reasons
which
caused
judge
rifkind
to
say
that
we
would
determine
the
future
needs
of
the
tribes
measured
by
irrigable
acres
exists
today,
because
it
provides
the
certainty
which
other
water
users
needed,
and
you
couldn't
estimate
how
much
the
indian
population
would
increase.
policy
reasons
are
the
same.
and
the
same
applies
to
the
other
issues.
if
there
is
a
good
reason
to
change,
if
it
wouldn't
hurt
the
other
party,
if
it
would
do
justice
under
the
law
of
the
case,
you
could
do
it.
what
the...
i
think
the
states
are
arguing
is
that...
or
i
should
say
what
they
are
doing,
i
believe,
is
confusing
the
grounds
for
reopening
with
the
standard
to
be
used
once
reopened,
it
is
determined
that
the
decree
should
be
opened.
justice...
judge
tuttle
found,
and
we
agree
that
the
mere
fact
there
has
been
change
in
technology
is
no
ground
to
reopen
the
decree.
the
mere
fact
that
if
we
came
into
court
today
and
more
acreage
would
be
irrigable
because
of
advanced
technology
is
not
a
ground
to
reopen.
it
is
only
if
we
did
not
get
a
fair
hearing
at
that
time
under
those
standards
that
were
applied,
but
judge
tuttle
found
that
was
ground
for
reopening.
but
he
said,
now,
having
found
grounds
for
reopening,
he
said,
then
it
only
makes
sense
to
apply
today's
technology,
because
it
would
just
complicate
the
case
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
technology
in
1956
to
'58.
furthermore,
the
states
never
asked
him
to
do
so.
the
states
put
on
no
evidence
as
to
the
difference
in
technology
between
'60,
1960
and
1980,
and
they
didn't
ask
the
master
to
make
any
findings
about
it,
and
they
took
no
exceptions
to
it.
that
issue
should
be
out
of
the
case.
the
only
thing
the
states
did
was
ask
the
master
to
determine
the
technology
at
the
time
the
reservations
were
created.
that's
way
back
in
1865
or
1870.
the
master
did
reject
that
out
of
hand,
but
they
never
requested
him
to
take
into
account
the
difference
in
technology
between
1960
and
1980.
the
states
suggest
that
there
would
be
no
injustice
to
the
tribes
because
this
court
approved
of
the
special
master's
holding,
special
master
rifkind's
holding
that
the
acreage
he
found
was
reasonable.
but
what
this
court
held
was
that
"the
various
acreages
of
irrigable
land
which
the
master
found
to
be
on
the
different
reservations
we
find
to
be
reasonable.
"
now,
the
states
suggest
that
what
he
is
talking
about
is
a
determination
that
the
number
of
acres
found
was
reasonable.
we
suggest
what
the
court...
the
court
had
just
previously
said
two
sentences
above,
that
the
tribes
were
entitled
to
all
the
practicably
irrigable
acres
on
the
reservation,
and
therefore
that
couldn't
be
what
it
intended,
it
must
have
intended
merely
to
approve
of
the
determination
of
irrigability
of
the
acres
that
the
special
master
awarded.
with
respect
to
the
timing
of
our
motion
and
the
state's
claimed
reliance,
our
motions
were
filed
in
1977
and
'78,
13
and
14
years
after
the
decree,
before
there
was
any
substantial
certainty
with
respect
to
the
present
perfected
rights.
remember,
the
tribes
were
awarded
905,000
acre
feet
in
the
original
case,
less
than
one-seventh
of
the
7,500,000
acres
awarded
to
the
lower
basin.
but
it
wasn't
until
1979
that
over
three-quarters
of
the
present
perfected
rights
were
determined.
now,
present
perfected
rights
have
priority
over
all
other
rights,
including
the
central
arizona
project
and
the
metropolitan
water
district,
yet
it
wasn't
until
after
the
tribes'
motions
were
filed
that
over
three-quarters
of
the
rights,
of
the
present
perfected
rights
were
determined.
how,
therefore,
could
central
arizona
project
and
mwd
find...
place
great
reliance
on
the
indian
allocation
of
'64?
second,
there
was
huge
uncertainty
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
water
in
the
colorado
river.
even
today
the
state
of
arizona
claims
that
there
is
an
assured
supply
of
water
of
550,000
acres.
they
claim
that
there
was
356,000
when
they
tried
to
get
the
central
arizona
project
going.
in
other
words,
arizona
told
the
congress
when
they
got
the
central
arizona
project
authorized
that
there
was
far
less
water
than
they
now
feel
is
available
today.
this
is
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
the
upper
basin
states
have
not
used
the
water
as
fast
as
was
anticipated.
third,
the
states
knew
that
the
boundary
disputes
had
not
been
determined,
and
that
the
tribes,
if
they
won
the
boundary
disputes,
would
be
entitled
to
more
water,
so
there
was
uncertainty
with
respect
to
even
the
additional
indian
claims.
the
metropolitan
water
district
claims
reliance,
arguing
that
after
the
'64
decree,
they
went
to
their
own
water
project
and
asked
for
additional
water
to
take
the
place
of
the
water
they
lost
to
arizona,
but
they
did
not
ask
for
any
additional
water
for
the
water
they
lost
to
the
indians.
they
lost
550,000
acres
feet
to
arizona,
and
they
lost
55,000
acre
feet
to
the
indians,
but
they
didn't
ask
their
own
california
water
project
for
that...
to
make
up
for
the
55,000.
now,
today,
in
this
case
we
are
only
asking
for
16,000
additional
acre
feet
for
the
indians,
or
less
than
one-third
of
the
55,000.
metropolitan
water
district's
excuse
for
not
asking
for
the
original
55,000
was
that
it
was
such
a
relatively
minor
amount,
it
was
unnecessary.
well,
we
suggest
if
they
didn't
bother
to
go
after
55,000
acres
and
supplement
it,
is
it
reasonable
to
believe
that
they
would
think
16,000
was
such
an
enormous
amount
that
it
would
change
their
position?
furthermore,
the
metropolitan
water
district
right
now
is
using
1.3
million
acre
feet.
the
16,000
acre
feet
we
are
claiming
is
just
a
fraction
more
than
1
percent
of
their
water,
well
within
the
range
of
estimating
accuracy,
the
closest
to
which
they
claim
they
can
estimate
in
the
river
is
10
percent.
finally,
what
the
states
are
really
complaining
about
is
injury
or
impact
rather
than
detrimental
reliance,
but
even
the
injury
they
claim
is
not
to
the
extent
to
which
it
is
claimed.
take
arizona,
for
example.
the
testimony
of
wes
stryner,
the
director
of
the
land
and
water
resources
department
of
the
state
of
arizona,
said
that
the
per
capita
use
of
water
in
phoenix
is
over
twice
what
it
is
in
the
city
of
tucson,
and
the
reason
it
is
over
twice
as
much
is
because
of
the
watering
of
lawns,
trees,
and
ornamental
shrubs,
and
that
if
the
people
in
phoenix
would
reduce
their
water
rate
to
be
equivalent
to
tucson,
there
would
be
more
than
enough
water
to
satisfy
all
the
additional
land
claims.
so,
what
does
it
come
down
to?
do
the
indians
get
the
water
for
agriculture
on
the
reservation,
or
do
the
people
of
phoenix
get
it
for
ornamental
shrubs,
if
you
want
to
talk
about
equities.
alternative
intervention,
for
just
a
minute.
i
think
that
maryland
versus
louisiana
is
directly
on
point.
i
can't
see
any
difference.
in
that
case,
17
pipeline
companies
intervened
in
the
case
of
30
cases...
30
states
against
another
state
and
the
united
states
against
another
state,
the
exact
fact
situation
we've
got
here,
except
it's
more
stay.
mr.
lawrence
a.
aschenbrenner
no,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
am
going
to
say
thank
you,
your
honor.
