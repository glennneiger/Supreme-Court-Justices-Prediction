mr.
claiborne,
can
i
just
interrupt
on
this?
you
say
they
are
presumptively
correct,
but
as
i
understand
your
opponents,
they
argue
they
had
no
opportunity...
they
are
treated
as
though
they
were
conclusively
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
doesn't
win
the
case
for
you.
isn't
it
your
position
they
are
conclusively
correct
for
the
purpose
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
are
not
subject
to
challenge--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
in
this
proceeding,
for
the
purposes
of
determining
the
respective
water
rights,
are
they
not
immune
from
challenge
under
the
master's
decree,
and
your
opponents
were
not
given
an
opportunity
to
challenge?
or
do
i
misread
the
report?
