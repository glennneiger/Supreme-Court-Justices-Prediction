mr.
carl
boronkay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
first
to
give
a
brief
statement
of
the
background
of
the
case
before
commencing
argument.
this
proceeding
before
the
court
derives
from
a
suit
filed
by
the
state
of
arizona
in
this
court
in
1952
to
determine
its
rights
to
colorado
river
water.
that
proceeding
was
heard
by
special
master
simon
rifkind,
who
after
lengthy
hearings
filed
a
report
with
the
court.
this
court's
decision
in
1963
allocated
water
among
the
states
of
arizona,
california,
and
nevada.
also
determined
were
the
water
rights
of
a
number
of
federal
establishments,
principally
five
indian
reservations
along
the
lower
colorado
river.
the
key
issue
involving
the
indian
reservations
was
the
measure
of
the
winters
doctrine
rights
of
the
indian
reservation.
master
rifkind
determined
that
the
proper
measure
was
the
practicably
irrigable
acreage
of
the
reservations.
he
then
determined
the
acreage
for
each
of
the
reservations,
and
allocated
water
in
accordance
with
that
determination.
this
court
adopted
master
rifkind's
determination
of
irrigable
acreage
and
the
water
allocations,
and
in
1964
entered
its
decree
implementing
the
1963
decision.
thereafter,
in
1977,
in
connection
with
a
joint
motion
to
enter
a
supplemental
decree
respecting
the
listing
of
present
perfected
rights,
which
matter
was
called
for
in
article
vi
of
the
1964
decree,
the
five
tribes
of
these
reservations
sought
to
intervene
for
the
purpose
of
seeking
additional
water
for
the
reservations.
in
the
following
year,
the
united
states
filed
a
motion
to
amend
the
1964
decree
to
seek
additional
water
for
each
of
the
reservations.
these
pleadings
and
the
responsive
pleadings
of
the
state
parties
were
referred
to
elbert
p.
tuttle
as
special
master
to
hear
the
matter.
master
tuttle
has
held
lengthy
hearings,
and
has
made
a
report
which
is
filed
before
this
court.
he
has
ruled
that
it
was
proper
to
reopen
the
original
proceedings
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
claims
that
there
exists
additional
irrigable
acreage
on
the
reservation
than
was
presented
in
the
initial
proceeding.
i
refer
to
this
as
the
reopening
issue.
some
refer
to
it
as
the
omitted
lands
issue.
he
has
ruled
further
that
it
was
proper
to
hear
claims
of
irrigable
acreage
for...
based
on
boundary
changes
made
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
the
reservations
subsequently
to
entry
of
the
1964
decree,
and
he
ruled
that
the
state
parties
could
not
challenge
whether
the
irrigable
acreage
claim
was
in
fact
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservations.
i
will
refer
to
this
as
the
boundaries
issue.
finally,
he
has
ruled
that
it
was
proper
for
the
tribes
to
intervene
as
independent
parties
with
their
own
counsel
to
make
claims
for
additional
water
for
the
reservation,
despite
the
claims...
the
defenses
of
the
three
states
based
on
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
he
permitted
the
united
states
to
continue
to
make
claims
for
additional
water
on
behalf
of
each
of
the
tribes.
i
will
now
address
these
three
issues,
and
my
colleague
will
address
following
certain
issues,
equitable
and
legal,
related
to
reopening
the
case,
and
also
discuss
issues
respecting
master
tuttle's
findings
with
regard
to
practicably
irrigable
acreage.
with
respect
to
reopening
the
case
to
hear
claims
that
there
existed
additional
irrigable
acreage
over
that
contended
for
by
the
united
states
in
the
original
proceedings,
master
tuttle
concedes
at
the
outset
that
were
these
claims
to
be
made
in
a
different
lawsuit,
they
would
be
subject
to
the
bar
of
res
judicata,
that
these
claims
are
not
indeed
new
claims,
but
were
within
the
issues
originally
tried
and
determined
some
20
years
before.
he
states,
however,
that
article
ix
of
the
decree--
mr.
carl
boronkay
--he
stated
it
would
be
res
judicata
ware
these
claims
to
be
made
in
another
proceeding.
mr.
carl
boronkay
in
this
particular
instance,
he
referred,
to
avoid
that
bar,
he
states
that
article
ix
of
the
court's
decree
permits
the
reopening
of
that
issue.
that
article
provides
that
any
party
may
apply
at
the
foot
of
the
decree
for
its
amendment
or
for
further
relief,
and
that
this
court
reserves
jurisdiction
for
the
purpose
of
entering
any
proper
order
in
relation
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
controversy.
we
submit
that
that
language
neither
in
its
form
nor
its
purpose
allows
a
party
to
come
back
many
years
after
final
adjudication
to
reopen
an
issue
on
the
basis
of
perhaps
an
error
in
trial
judgment
or
what
amounts
to
the
splitting
of
a
cause
of
action.
this
language
of
article
ix
is
found
in
major
water
adjudications,
particularly
equitable
apportionment
cases.
its
office
and
function
is
to
permit
the
court
to
modify
a
decree
due
to
changed
circumstances.
its
orientation
is
in
the
future.
a
changed
condition
which
means
the
decree
is
no
longer
workable,
which
means
it
has
to
be
modified
to
become
workable.
we
are
aware
of
no
case
that
has
interpreted
language
such
as
this
to
allow
a
party
to
come
back
merely
because
he
has
a
change
of
position,
a
different
position
that
he
feels
he
should
have
taken
and
could
have
taken
in
the
original
suit,
and
yet
this
is
the
position
urged
by
the
united
states
and
adopted
by
master
tuttle.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
only
unprecedented,
but
it
is
unsound
to
accept
this
interpretation,
for
it
obviously
allows
relitigation
of
issues
finally
determined,
casts
an
intolerable
burden
on
the
courts,
creates
instability
in
judgments,
and,
of
course,
adds
unnecessary
costs
to
litigants.
mr.
carl
boronkay
the
adjustment
that
i
believe
the
chief
justice
refers
to
would
be
the
boundary
adjustments
in
article
ii(d)(5)
of
the
decree,
and
that
is
a
specific
provision
that
permits
the
reopening
for
a
specific
purpose,
and
i
will
indicate
that
the
condition
of
reopening
for
that
purpose
has
not
been
met
in
this
case,
but
with
regard
to
article
ix,
that
is...
i
might
call
it
a
phrase
of
art.
it
is
not
just
a
bland,
broad
statement
reserving
jurisdiction
for
any
purposes.
it
has
a
certain
function
to
fulfill,
and
that
is
the
modification
of
a
decree
for
changes
in
the
future.
we
submit
that
article
ix
in
no
way
permits
a
party
merely
to
say
that
if
he
had
a
second
chance
he
could
do
better,
and
that
is
the
use
being
made
of
that
article
here.
mr.
carl
boronkay
precisely.
indeed,
if
article
ix
may
be
read
so
broadly,
and
we
don't
think
it
should,
there
would
be
no
reason
for
any
party
having
an
interest
to
come
in
and
relitigate
matters
if
they
feel
they
have
certain
equities,
or
they
believe
they
could
do
better.
moreover,
i
believe
there
could
be
the
periodic
reopening
of
this
case
for
claims
of
irrigable
acreage.
mr.
carl
boronkay
indeed,
it
would
not.
i
foresee
future
generations
of
united
states
attorneys
wanting
to
second
guess
their
predecessors,
and
utilizing
current
technology,
saying,
indeed,
we
might
have
asked
for
a
greater
amount
of
irrigable
acreage
than
was
claimed
20
years
earlier,
and
i
don't
see
any
place
to
stop
that
process.
moreover,
article
ix
was
proposed
by
master
rifkind.
master
rifkind
made
it
clear
in
the
record
again
and
again
that
he
was
striving
for
a
certainty
so
far
as
possible
of
water
rights
and
finality
of
a
decree,
and
he
is
the
master
that
urged
this
terminology,
and
yet
it
would
be
used
to
undermine
his
purpose.
accordingly,
we
feel
there
was
no
basis
for
reopening
the
litigated
matter
which
judge
tuttle
indicates
was
litigated,
and
article
ix
provides
no
basis
for
relitigating
some
20
years
later.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
will
turn
to
the
boundaries
issue,
if
i
may.
with
respect
to
the
boundaries
determination
of
master
tuttle,
we
respectfully
submit
his
treatment
is
no
more
defensible
than
with
respect
to
the
reopening
issue.
it
is
to
be
recalled
that
the
boundary
issue
was
fully
tried
in
the
first
litigation,
that
california
protested
that
some
of
the
boundaries
being
urged
by
the
united
states
were
wrong,
that
the
irrigable
acreage
on
parts
of
the
mojave
and
colorado
river
indian
reservations
were
outside
the
reservations,
and
therefore
had
no
basis
for
a
winters
doctrine
water
right.
mr.
carl
boronkay
to
my
recollection,
there
are
federal
lands
abutting
the
indian
reservations
in
the
case
of
fort
mojave
and
colorado
river.
and
so,
california
in
protesting
these
boundary
determinations
of
the
united
states
raised
that
issue.
the
united
states
joined
in
that
issue.
there
was
no
protest
to
its
being
tried,
and
indeed
it
was
fully
tried,
and
for
the
most
part,
the
boundaries
were
found
to
be
incorrect.
mr.
carl
boronkay
this
court
adopted
the
irrigable
acreage
that
was
computed
based
on
the
boundary
determination,
adopted
the
water
allocated
dependent
on
the
amount
of
acreage
so
computed,
but
rejected
the
findings
as
to
the
boundaries
as
being
unnecessary.
mr.
carl
boronkay
this
court
did
not
adopt
the
boundary
findings,
though
it
did
adopt
the
acreage
that
was
calculated--
mr.
carl
boronkay
--on
those
boundaries.
mr.
carl
boronkay
this
court
did
not
determine
the
boundaries--
mr.
carl
boronkay
--ii(d)(5)
provides
in
setting
forth
the
allocations
of
water
for
the
different
reservations,
that
provision
states
that
these
allocations
with
respect
to
fort
mojave
and
the
colorado
river
indian
reservation,
that
the
allocations
being
adopted
by
this
court
that
master
rifkind
found
were
subject
to
adjustment
in
the
event
the
boundaries
are
finally
determined.
and
so,
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
united
states
could
properly
avail
itself
of
article
ii(d)(5),
whether
it
has
made
a
showing
that
the
boundaries
of
these...
the
disputed
boundaries
of
these
two
reservations
had
been
finally
determined.
mr.
carl
boronkay
master
rifkind
had
attempted
to
determine
the
boundaries,
and
it
wasn't
good
enough
for
this
court,
and
i
suggest
that
it
wasn't
good
enough
for
this
court
for
the
reason
that
this
court
was
concerned
with
the
possibility
that
due
to
the
states'
participation,
the
parens
patriae
doctrine
would
bind
other
parties
that
might
have
land
claims
who
were
not
parties
to
the
suit.
accordingly,
this
court
rejected
the
findings
as
to
boundaries,
but
the
matter
might
have
been
finished
at
that
point
with
respect
to
irrigable
acreage
of
each
reservation,
and
as
to
the
water
allocation
dependent
on
irrigable
acreage.
i
suggest
that
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
would
have
bound
all
the
parties
to
the
irrigable
acreage
determination
had
not
the
court
in
ii(d)(5)
given
the
united
states
another
chance,
so
to
speak,
an
extra
chance.
but
i
do
not
feel
this
court
intended
by
giving
the
united
states
the
extra
chance
that
it
could
determine
those
boundaries
conclusively
on
the
adverse
party
by
unilateral
action
such
as
it
has
presented
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
it
relies
on
secretarial
orders
based
on
surveys
of
boundaries
for
approximately
90
percent
of
its
boundary
claim,
and
for
approximately
10
percent
it
relies
on
four
or
five
judgments,
most
of
which
are
stipulated
judgments.
in
neither
of
these
situations
are
the
parties
adversely
affected,
the
state
parties,
given
any
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
determination
of
those
boundaries,
and
yet
the
united
states
says
we
are
bound
by
those
boundaries.
our
water
rights
are
directly
affected
by
those
boundary
determinations,
which
include
or
exclude
irrigable
acreage,
and
yet
the
united
states
comes
forward
and
says
it
may
unilaterally
determine
those
boundaries
for
the
purpose
of
modifying
water
allocations
of
these
reservations
which
resulted
from
a
complete
adjudication
with
all
adverse
parties
present.
we
submit
that
that
wasn't
the
intent
of
this
court.
it
would
be
ironic
indeed
if
the
very
boundaries
that
were
tried
and
found
to
be
incorrect
before
special
master
rifkind
were
to
be
conclusively
imposed
upon
the
state
parties
by
virtue
of
having
the
stamp
of
approval
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
some
years
later.
mr.
carl
boronkay
yes.
because
of
the
concern
as
to
special
master
tuttle's
rulings,
the
metropolitan
water
district
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
approximately
a
year
and
a
half
ago
an
action
in
both
declaratory
relief
and
under
the
administrative
procedures
act
to
test
the
administrative
orders.
that
action
is
still
pending.
the
court
having
heard
it
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
standing,
for
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states,
for
statute
of
limitations
purposes.
the
court,
however,
felt
that
it
should
not
rule
pending
the
determination
by
this
court
of
this
case.
mr.
carl
boronkay
that
is
correct.
we
are
directly
affected
by
that
boundary
just
as
an
adjoining
landowner
would
be
directly
affected
by
their
boundary.
we
are
affected
for
a
species
of
real
property,
water,
as
opposed
to
land.
so,
for
these
reasons,
we
feel
that
the
mischief
that
could
result
from
a
ruling
that
the
boundary
determinations
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
very
great
when
we
consider
that
these
reservations
all
abutt
vast
federal
acreage
under
the
ruling...
under
the
control
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
and
that
he
again
and
again
surveys
and
resurveys
land,
and
by
doing
so
he
can
add
a
great
irrigable
acreage
to
the
reservations,
give
them
an
additional
water
right
with
an
early
priority,
adverse
to
our
position,
and
under
the
proposed
interpretation
of
the
united
states,
we
would
have
no
ability
to
contradict
those
boundary
determinations
no
matter
how
obviously
wrong
they
were.
mr.
carl
boronkay
we
are
actually--
mr.
carl
boronkay
--he
rejected
the--
mr.
carl
boronkay
--he
essentially
found
with
regard
to
the
two
reservations...
there
are
five
now
that
have
boundary
questions.
there
were
only
two
at
that
time.
mr.
carl
boronkay
with
respect
to
the
colorado
river
indian
reservation,
he
found
that
the
intended
boundary,
the
west
bank
of
the
colorado
river,
was
to
be
the
boundary
as
the
river
imperceptibly
moved.
mr.
carl
boronkay
the
united
states
took
a
position
that
the
boundary
was
a
fixed
boundary.
hence
they
sought
to
determine
meander
lines,
and--
mr.
carl
boronkay
--some
by
executive
order
and
some
by
acts
of
congress,
and
i
can't
tell
you
at
this
moment
whether
the
colorado
river
indian
reservation
was
one
or
the
other.
with
respect
to
fort
mojave--
mr.
carl
boronkay
--it
is
not
the
issue
in
that
we
have
no
land
interest,
and--
mr.
carl
boronkay
--it
is
what
the
boundary
was
in
the
past,
but
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
actions
taken
subsequently
to
the
1964
decree
purports
to
restore
lands,
adding
irrigable
acreage,
which
he
would
like
recognized
as
always
having
been
part
of
the
reservations.
mr.
carl
boronkay
now,
we
submit
that
when
you
consider
all
the
acreage
that
it
is
possible
to
add
to
the
reservations
and
give
them
additional
water
rights
to
the
detriment
of
the
state
parties,
we
feel
that
the
united
states
has
not
met
the
condition
of
article
ii(d)(5)
that
there
have
been
a
final
determination
of
the
boundaries
for
the
purpose
of
modifying
an
adjudicated
water
right,
a
right
of
each
of
these
reservations
which
resulted
from
a
full
adjudication.
we
don't
feel
that
merely
secretarial
action,
administrative
action,
valid
for
administrative
purposes,
is
the
type
of
action
or
activity
that
should
permit
the
united
states
unilaterally
to
come
in
and
say,
now,
we
can
modify
the
water
rights
and
you
can't
challenge
it.
i
believe
this
court
intended
that
we
either
have
the
opportunity
to
challenge
those
water...
the
boundaries
for
water
adjudication
purposes
or,
as
we
conclude,
the
united
states
is
premature.
they
have
come
to
the
court
in
advance
of
being
able
to
show
that
the
boundaries
have
been
finally
determined.
i
may
illustrate
that
with
the
fort
yuma
reservation,
where
there
have
been
various
solicitor
opinions
over
a
40-year
period
recognizing
particular
boundaries,
but
the
day
before
the
united
states
filed
its
motion
you
had
a
new
solicitor's
opinion
that
ignored
the
three
prior
opinions
and
added
25,000
acres
to
that
reservation,
and
according
to
the
united
states,
we
have
no
ability
to
challenge
that,
and
yet
our
water
rights
are
directly
determined.
i
would
like
in
the
moments
left
to
turn
to
the
question
of
the
intervention
of
the
tribes.
master
tuttle
allowed
the
five
tribes
to
intervene
despite
objections
of
the
three
states
urging
their
eleventh
amendment
rights.
in
doing
so,
he
relied
on
section...
on
title
xxviii
of
the
united
states
code
section
1362.
we
submit
that
1362
doesn't
relate
at
all
to
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states.
master
tuttle
cites
some
three
united
states
district
court
cases
which
i
submit
badly
misread
the
decision
of
this
court
written
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
moe
versus
the
salish
and
kootenai
tribes.
that
case
permitted
the
indian
tribe
to
have
the
same
position
as
the
united
states
with
respect
to
a
statute
that
did
not
permit
the
united
states
district
court
to
issue
an
injunction
against
state
enforcement
of
sales
tax
on
the
reservation.
the
case
reasoned
that
1362
permitted
the
tribes
to
file
a
suit
where
the
united
states
could
have
sued
in
their
behalf
and
failed
to
do
so.
so
that
case
treated
the
tribes
as
being
in
the
same
position
as
the
united
states
where
the
tribes
brought
the
suit
instead
of
the
united
states.
this
is
a
far
cry,
i
submit,
from
saying
that
the
tribes
are
to
be
treated
the
same
as
the
united
states
for
all
purposes,
such
as
waiver
of
the
eleventh
amendment
rights
of
the
states,
and
indeed,
in
the
many
statements
of
this
court
in
numerous
cases
that
in
order...
that
congressional
intent
to
waive
the
state's
sovereign
immunity
must
be
direct
and
explicit
and
will
not
be
implied
unless
there
is
an
overwhelming--
mr.
carl
boronkay
--over...
that
is
correct.
i
stand
correct.
override,
unless
there
is
an
overwhelming
implication.
well,
there
is
neither
an
explicit
indication
in
1362
of
such
overriding,
nor
is
there
any
kind
of
implication
in
my
opinion.
for
these
reasons,
we
feel
that
1362
provides
no
basis
for
master
tuttle's
permitting
intervention
of
the
tribes.
moreover,
if
it
were
construed
to
permit
an
intervention,
it
would
be,
or
the
overriding
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
it
would
be
a
partial
waiver
or
partial
overriding
in
that
the
section
itself,
1362,
confers
jurisdiction
upon
the
united
states
district
court.
it
does
not
refer
or
purport
to
extend
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
and
finally,
as
the
moe
case
indicates,
it
was
only
where
the
united
states
could
have
and
failed
to
sue
on
behalf
of
the
indian
tribes
that
the
indian
tribes
have
the
right
to
sue.
in
this
instance,
we
have
the
united
states
having
brought
the
very
cause
of
action
which
the
tribes
seek
to
intervene.
for
all
these
reasons--
mr.
carl
boronkay
--i
believe
it
is
distinguishable
on
the
grounds
that
the
states
were
already
involved,
and
i
didn't
see
any
practical
effect
to
be
attained
by
the
sovereign
immunity
question
as
to
individuals.
i
would
like
to
have
saved
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
