justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
say
it
would
be
res
judicata
or
law
of
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
"waive"
isn't
really
quite
the
right
word,
is
it?
it
is
override.
"waive"
suggests
a
voluntary--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
special
master
really...
he
wouldn't
have
gone
to
the
questions
of
law
of
the
case
unless
he
had
felt
the
indians
would
be
bound
under
some
principles
analogous
to
res
judicata.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
reservation
was
it
proposed
to
grow
grapes
on?
or
which
climatic
zone
of
the--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
would
be
right
by
yuma?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
what
extent
do
you
mean
that
the
states
admit
the
so-called
gross
error
to
which
you
refer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
are
arguing
is
just
that
the
government
was
greedy
enough
the
first
time
around.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
well,
that
is
why
we
are
reviewing
his
findings.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
asked
you
about
what
sort
of
a
gross
error
it
was
that
you
claimed
should
allow
this
matter
to
be
reopened
after
all
these
years.
and
it
boils
down
to
just
the
fact
that
by
hindsight,
the
government
should
have
been
more
aggressive
or
more
assertive,
or
whatever
you
want
to
say,
that
maybe
they
could
have
gotten
more
if
they
had
asked
for
it,
but
that
is
not
even
a
doctrine
for
reopening
under
a
law
of
the
case,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
in
any
other
kind
of
a
case,
say,
where
there
wasn't
a
special
master,
but
just
litigation
between
ordinary
private
parties,
one
party
could
come
in
15
years
later
simply
because
it
was
an
equitable
decree
and
there
had
been
a
provision
to
allow
reopening
and
saying
under
law
of
the
case
i
now
find
that
i
want
to
reargue
things
that
were
settled
15
years
ago?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
that?
i
mean,
if
the
decree
had
become
final
and
been
entered,
i
suppose
anyone
whose
standing
under
the
decree
when
entered
would
object
to
a
reopening,
whether
in
'65
or
now.
their
claims
might
have
been
better
the
more
time
had
elapsed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--go
ahead.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
contend
that
article
ix
would
allow
any
party
to
reopen
any
question
if
they
found
that
they
simply
hadn't
made
as
strong
claims
as
they
now
thought
they
should
have?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
how
do
you
distinguish
your
claim
from
that
of,
say,
the
states,
who
might
feel,
as
they
apparently
do,
that
had
they
asked
for
more,
asked
for
it
in
a
different
way
in
'63,
they
would
have
gotten
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
you
don't
get
to
the
reliance
unless
you
show
the
sort
of...
what
you
refer
to
as
a
gross
error
that
would
justify
the
evaluation
of
reliance.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
other
principals
are
bound
by
the
acts
of
their
attorneys.
why
shouldn't
the
indian
tribes
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but,
so
you
don't
think--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
but
certainly
under
heckman
they
are
bound.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
assert
they
are
not
bound?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
special
master
didn't
find
in
your
favor
on
that,
did
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
definition
of
any
grievous
error,
i
suppose,
is
any
claim
that
might
have
been
made
but
wasn't,
that
you
could
open
up
any
portion
of
the
decree
under
that
standard.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
have
to
rely,
then,
on
1362.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
we
are
equally
free
to
construe
the
existing
article
ix
to
prevent
the
sort
of
reopening
which
the
government
has
tried
to
make
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
not
to
strain
the
doctrine
of
law
of
the
case.
