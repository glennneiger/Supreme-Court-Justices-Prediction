justice

i
suppose
if
the
use
of
article
ix
made
here
is
acceptable,
one
of
the
states
or
the
lower
basin
states...
basin
states,
either
one
could
ask
to
relitigate
the
division
of
water--
justice
byron
r.
white
--this
wouldn't
be
the
last
of
it,
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
we
do
with
that
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
set
it
aside.
we
didn't
adopt
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
as
long
as
that
was
the
acreage
within
the
boundaries
as
then...
as
the
master
had
determined,
but
we
didn't
say
those
were
the
boundaries.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
ii(d)(5)?
what
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
master
thought
that
he
was
finally
determining
them,
didn't
he?
they
had
been
litigated
between
adverse
parties.
and
that
wasn't
good
enough
for
this
court,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
are
talking
about
what
the
boundaries
of
the
reservations
were
when
the
suit
was
started,
aren't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
are
talking
about...
what
did
master
rifkind
purport
to
find?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
boundaries?
the
boundaries
at
the
time
the
suit
started.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
these
reservations
established
by
act
of
congress,
or
by
executive
order,
or
by--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you
are
not...
the
question
isn't
whether
or
not
that
a
reservation
that
had
a...
whose
boundaries
were
not
in
dispute
during
this
lawsuit
could
now
be
changed,
and
the
boundaries
just
expanded.
that
is
not
the
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
what
is
the
accurate
boundary
at
some
time
in
the
past.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
why...
assuming
the
tribes
are
properly
in
the
case,
why
should
the
tribes
be
bound
by
the
previous
decision?
were
they
parties
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume...
is
there
some
claim
in
the
case
that
the
united
states
breached
its
trust,
or
did
not
properly
represent
the
tribes
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
preclusion
of
the
tribe
would
depend
upon...
in
this
case
would
depend
upon
the
adequate
representation
of
the
united
states
in
the
original
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
water
rights
been
generally
settled?
have
reserved
rights
been
settled
with
respect
to
all
the
reservations?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
some
general
adjudication
in
progress?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
were
they...
were
the
adjudications
going
on
in...
the
general
adjudications
going
on
in
the
state
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
has
the
ninth
circuit
decision
got
to
do
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whatever
the
standard
was
in
this...
in
this
case,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
prevent
a
different
standard
being
applied
in
other
proceedings
with
different
parties,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
especially
if
the
different
standard
you
are
insisting
upon
originated
in
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
which
standard?
which
standard?
the
latest
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne,
suppose
the
case,
the
issue
is
reopened,
as
you
suggest
it
should
be,
and
suppose
that
there
is
a
later
case
that
indicates
rather
clearly
that
the
standard
used
by
the
court
and
by
the
special
master
in
this
'64
decree
has
now
been
changed,
or
that
it
should
no
longer
be
applied.
why
wouldn't
you
say
that
the
new
legal
standard
would
apply?
i
am
not
saying
there
is
one,
but
suppose
there
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
stranger
than
inviting
relitigation
of
the
very
issue
that
was
litigated
in
the
first
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
must.
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
call
it
restored?
do
you
say
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
at
the
time
the
special
master
determined
boundaries
that
he
correctly
determined
them,
but
that
the
united
states
has
now
just
enlarged
the
boundaries,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
restoring.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
were
they...
how
were
they
deprived
of
reservation
status
in
the
interim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
had
the
department
of
interior
treated
these
lands
as
being
outside
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there
was
ambivalence,
the
latest
position
of
the
interior
department
doesn't
remove
it.
it
just...
it
just
exacerbates
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
just
the
only...
the
latest
step.
it
is
an
ambivalence
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
unless
it
changes
its
mind
in
the
next
administration.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
claiborne,
what
is
your...
the
united
states'
position
in
these
other
forums?
are
you
taking
the
position
that
the
secretary's
proceedings
are
open
to
review,
or
are
you
moving
to
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction,
or
on
sovereign
immunity
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
saying...
your
position
is
that
these
determinations
are
not
subject
to
review
anywhere,
here
or
in
another
forum.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
they
had
prevailed.
would
you
still
take
the
same
position
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
united
states
is
in
this
court
litigating.
it
is
not...
so
it
is
subject
to
being...
having
its
case
decided
here.
you
can't
get
out
of
this
case
with
a
sovereign
immunity
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
--
this
case
began
way
back
in
1952
when
arizona
filed
a
motion
for
--
leave
to
file
as
a
case
against
california
to
settle
the
respective
shares
of
the
lower
basin
states
in
the
colorado
river.
we
appointed
a
special
master
who
took
evidence
for
several
years
and
filed
a
massive
report.
the
case
was
argued
twice
and
finally
opinion
was
announced
in
1963
and
a
decree
entered
in
1964.
that
decree
settled
the
amount
of
water
that
the
upper
basin
states
were
to
deliver
to
the
lower
and
also
settled
the
shares
of
the
lower
basin
states
among
themselves.
the
decree
also
determined
the
water
rights
of
the
indian
reservations
in
the
lower
--
in
the
lower
basin.
the
--
we
retained
jurisdiction,
however,
for
various
reasons
among
others
because
the
so-called
presently
perfected
rights
that
would
have
priority
had
not
yet
been
determine.
also,
there
were
boundary
disputes
about
the
indian
reservations
that
still
have
to
be
finally
determined.
in
1979,
we
amended
the
decree
when
they
--
when
the
presently
--
present
perfected
rights
have
been
determined.
but
meanwhile,
the
indian
tribes
and
later
the
united
states
moved
to
reopen
the
proceedings
in
two
respects.
first,
it
was
alleged
that
in
the
proceedings
leading
up
to
the
1964
decree,
the
--
a
fair
amount
of
irrigable
acreage
had
been
mistakenly
overlooked
and
that
the
--
then
additional
water
rights
were
--
should
be
allocated
to
the
reservations.
secondly,
it
was
said
that
the
boundary
disputes
had
been
finally
determined
and
that
the
--
the
--
there
was
a
good
deal
additional
territory
to
be
included
in
the
indian
reservations
and
hence
more
water
to
be
allocated.
we
appointed
a
special
master
who
took
a
testimony
and
took
up
--
who
heard
the
case
and
he
recommended
that
in
almost
all
respects
the
--
that
we
accept
the
claims
of
the
tribes
in
the
--
in
the
united
states.
exceptions
were
filed
and
briefed
and
--
and
argued.
and
now
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
sustain
the
exceptions
of
the
--
of
the
states.
we
hold
that
the
irrigable
acreage
issue
was
fully
litigated
and
finally
determined
in
the
1964
decree
and
was
not
subject
to
relitigation.
secondly,
with
some
minor
exception
or
two,
we
hold
that
because
litigation
is
still
pending
with
respect
to
the
boundary
disputes
those
boundaries
have
not
yet
been
finally
determined.
accordingly,
we
sustain
the
exception
of
the
states.
justice
brennan
joined
by
justices
blackmun
and
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
marshall
took
no
part
in
the
determination
or
consideration
of
the
case.
