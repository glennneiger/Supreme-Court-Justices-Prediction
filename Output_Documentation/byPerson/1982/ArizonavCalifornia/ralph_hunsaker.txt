mr.
ralph
hunsaker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
the
court
is
aware,
there
are
two
main
categories
of
land
which
are
involved
in
this
matter.
the
first
of
which
mr.
boronkay
addressed
is
boundary
lands.
the
second
of
which
i
would
call
consciously
excluded
lands,
and
which
we
have
referred
through
this
matter
as
omitted
lands.
the
states
believe
that
they
had
finally
litigated
the
matter
of
these
excluded
lands,
and
i
think
a
review
of
the
record
will
show
that
master
rifkind
also
believed
that.
i
will
not
take
the
time
to
quote,
but
i
will
paraphrase
some
comments
from
the
united
states
attorneys
with
respect
to
these
lands
to
get
it
in
our
minds.
mr.
warner,
the
united
states
attorney
who
tried
the
case,
indicated
to
master
rifkind
that
the
decree
will
serve
the
purpose
of
res
judicata
for
the
maximum
water
for
the
reservations,
and
that
there
would
be
no
claim
for
other
lands
on
the
reservations
even
though
they
may
be
irrigable,
and
he
felt
also,
as
he
indicated,
that
it
was
his
duty
to
prove
to
the
full
extent
that
he
could
the
indian
water
claims,
and
also
that
the
maps
which
they
put
into
evidence
showing
the
irrigable
lands
constituted
the
united
states
bill
of
particulars
with
respect
to
the
lands
that
they
claimed
to
be
irrigable.
now,
we
believe
that
this
does
not
therefore
describe
inadvertent
mistakes
as
the
united
states
attorneys
now
seek
to
label
the
efforts
of
the
u.s.
attorneys
in
the
1950's.
we
believe
that
the
1963
decision
and
64
decree
of
this
court
became
the
law
of
the
case,
that
the
matters
were
fully
litigated,
and
that
res
judicata
principles
apply.
we
had
spent
seven
weeks
approximately
presenting
evidence
on
this
reopening
matter,
and
indeed
the
very
same
kind
of
evidence
that
was
presented
in
the
fifties
with
respect
to
the
claims
for
the
five
reservations
were
presented
in
the
relitigation
of
these
issues.
there
were
soil
classification
experts
who
were
called
to
classify
the
soils
involved,
engineers
who
were
called
to
talk
about
irrigation
systems
and
methods
of
irrigating
the
lands
involved.
there
were
maps
presented
showing
the
irrigation...
the
irrigable
acreages
claimed
in
addition
to
those
submitted
in
the
decree
in
1964.
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
in
that
regard,
there...
most
of
the
lands
submitted
by
the
tribes
comes
from
the
examination
of
new
technology,
so-called
sprinkler
and
drip
irrigation,
and
so
virtually
a
large
percent,
and
i
cannot
tell
you
the
exact
percentage
now,
but
a
large
percent
of
the
lands
presented
by
the
tribes
themselves
at
this
time
comes
from
those
technological
advances.
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
no,
the
testimony
in
the
case
would
indicate
that
these
lands
were
somewhat
hilly,
and
they
could
have
been,
i
guess,
leveled,
but
the
economics
of
doing
that
may
have
been
prohibitive.
we
feel
that
the
fact
that
the
current
united
states
attorneys
choose
to
ignore
the
assurances
of
their
predecessors
of
the
fifties
cannot
serve
as
a
basis
for
relitigation
of
the
issues.
in
effect,
they
are
saying
that
our
predecessors
cannot
bind
us,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
court
decrees
should
be
treated
so
lightly,
but
in
fact
deserve
finality.
we
think
that
in
article
ix,
when
this
court
indicated
that
it
would
retain
jurisdiction
for
matters
which
were
ix
should
not
be
construed
so
broadly
as
to
make
this
attempt
at
relitigation
proper,
and
even
if
it
were
to
be
so
considered,
that
nevertheless
the
preclusive
doctrines
about
which
we
have
briefed
and
talked
about
this
morning
should
prevent
this
effort.
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
well,
your
honor,
i
suppose
in
the
proper
context
that
a
newly
discovered
issue
could
be
raised.
however,
we
do
not
think
that
this
is
a
newly
discovered
issue,
for
these
lands
were
indeed
considered
by
the
united
states
attorneys
in
the
fifties,
and
for
whatever
their
reasons
were,
were
excluded
as
being
irrigable
at
that
time,
and
were
not
therefore
presented
to
the
court,
but
they
nevertheless
were
considered
by
those
attorneys
at
that
time
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should
be
presented
as
being
irrigable.
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
they
were
parties
in
that
the
united
states
represented
them
at
the
hearing
before
the
special
master
rifkind.
we
feel
that
the
case
of
heckman
versus
united
states
clearly
sets
forth
the
obligation
of
the
united
states,
and
it
indicates
that
the
representation
by
the
united
states
is
a
full
representation,
and
that
therefore
they
were
represented
in
the
action.
it
is
true
that
they
were
not
represented
by
independent
attorneys--
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
--your
honor,
that
claim
was
discussed
during
the
case,
but
we
submit
that
the
special
master
did
not
make
any
finding
in
that
regard.
we
further
submit
that
the
record
does
not
have
any
testimony
in
it
which
would
support
such
a
finding,
and
while
it
was
mentioned,
that
was
essentially
all
that
occurred.
it
was
simply
broached
in
the
context
of
being
mentioned,
but
there
was
no
finding
or--
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
--that's
right.
it
would
depend
upon
the
representation
of
the
united
states
at
that
time,
and
again
which
we
submit
was
a
full
representation.
for
the--
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
--i
believe
that
there
is
insufficient
evidence.
indeed,
i
am
not
aware
really
of
any
direct
evidence
that
was
presented
in
the
trial,
and
i
suppose
that
the
only
way
that
that
determination
could
be
made
would
be
upon
a
remand,
because
there
certainly
is
no
finding
in
this
record
at
this
time
by
special
master
tuttle
to
that
effect.
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
indeed,
master
tuttle
cites,
we
submit,
in
his
discussions
about
whether
or
not
article
ix
was
intended
to
preclude
the
representation
of
evidence,
he
cites
only
one
brief,
and
that
is
the
imperial
irrigation
district,
versus
all
of
the
evidence
that
master
rifkind
sought
from
in
the
way
of
admissions
from
the
united
states
attorneys
and
put
on
the
record
himself
that
he
intended
the
litigation
of
the
indian
issues
to
be
final.
and
we
feel
that
it
is
overwhelming
in
the
history
of
the
transcript
of
these
proceedings
in
the
1950's
that
it
was
intended
to
be
and
should
be
final.
there
has
been
no
fraud
alleged,
which
is
one
of
the
bases
that
this
court
talked
about
in
the
sea
land
services,
inc.,
versus
gaudet
opinion
as
a...
serving
as
a
basis
to
set
aside
a
judgment
or
decree
of
the
court,
and
no
such
allegations
were
made,
and
indeed
no
such
evidence
was
presented.
we
do
not
feel
that
the
matter
of
reliance
upon
the
decree
is
a
necessary
element
of
the
preclusive
doctrines
about
which
we
talked.
nevertheless,
evidence
was
presented
in
the
context
of
the
trial
held
below,
and
in
the
context
of
the
equities
involved
to
show
that
there
was
major
reliance
upon
the
decree
which
had
been
rendered
by
this
court
in
1963.
indeed,
arizona
came
to
this
court
with
the
original
action
for
the
very
purpose
of
finally
and
fully
establishing
its
right
to
this
water.
they
had
been
before
the
congress
many
occasions
seeking
to
obtain
authorization
for
the
central
arizona
project,
and
had
met
with
resistance,
among
the
claims
being
that
they
did
not
have
a
final
adjudicated
right
to
the
water
involved.
and
so,
that
was
the
very
purpose
in
coming
to
the
court
with
the
original
action,
to
establish
that.
since
that
time,
they
have
obtained
authorization
through
the
congress
for
the
central
arizona
project.
they
have
assessed
taxes
against
their
citizens
in
three
of
the
counties
to
assure
repayment
of
the
reimbursible
features
of
the
project.
they
have
gone
before
the
congress
and
talking
about
sizing
of
the
canal
to
deliver
the
water,
and
reliance
upon
the
fact
that
there
would
be
received
the
amount
of
water
that
was
determined
to
be
its
remaining
entitlement
in
this
decision.
and
indeed
the
united
states
supported
it
before
the
congress,
indicating
that
it
had
a
firm
supply
to
its
remaining
entitlement,
and
therefore
it
could
invoke
the
reclamation
laws
of
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
building
this
project.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
preclusion
doctrines
to
apply
to
this
situation,
and
that
it
should
affirm
the
1964
decree
as
written,
and
return
the
parties
to
their
stated
reliance
upon
that
decree.
on
the
other
hand,
if
article
ix
is
broad
enough
to
permit
the
reopening
of
the
nature
that
occurred
before
master
tuttle,
then
we
submit
that
it
is
likewise
broad
enough
to
reopen
for
all
purposes.
and
some
of
those
purposes
that
were
presented
to
master
tuttle
and
rejected
by
him
as
not
appropriate
are
the
fact
that
this
court
in
the
interim
since
1964
decided
two
very
important
cases
that
defined
further
the
reserved
water
rights
doctrine,
those
cases
being
united
states
versus
new
mexico
and
the
state
of
washington
versus
the
washington
state
commercial
passenger
vessels
fishing
association.
the
definitions
and
guidelines
which
were
rendered
by
this
court
in
those
two
decisions,
we
submit,
are
that
the
reservation
doctrine
only
reserves
that
amount
of
water
which
is
for
the
primary
purposes
for
which
the
reservation
was
created,
and
not
for
any
secondary
purposes
which
it
may
serve,
and
further,
that
though
there
may
be
a
maximum
reserve...
reserved
water,
that
the...
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
particular
people
involved
will
receive
that
full
amount,
but
they
will
receive
the
amount
of
that
scarce
natural
resource
that
is
necessary
to
provide
them
with
a
moderate
living.
these
decisions
came
down
in
'78
and
'79
respectively.
we
submitted
to
master
tuttle
the
question
on
the
basis
that
if
he
construed
article
ix
broadly
enough
to
permit
a
reopening,
then
it,
too,
should
be
construed
broadly
enough
to
permit
a
reopening
to
look
at
these
issues
and
see
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
revision
of
the
decree
of
1964
based
upon
these
new
guidelines
that
have
been
presented
by
this
court
in
these
two
decisions.
we
submit
that
those
issues
should
have
been
heard
by
master
tuttle
and
were
not.
the
technology
problem
is
also--
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
--your
honor,
we...
mr.
chief
justice,
we
presented
motions
to
the
master
at
a
pretrial
hearing
that
we
be
allowed
to
hear
these
issues
before
him.
these
motions
were
presented
in
writing,
and
the
master
overruled
our
motions.
indeed,
we
were
in
the
process
of
discovery
with
respect
to
the
moderate
living
standard
that
would
be
applied.
at
the
time
we
had
arranged
to
go
to
the
various
indian
reservations
to
visit
with
them,
and
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
obtain
records
with
respect
to
the
leasing
of
lands
and
this
kind
of
evidence,
and
of
course
that
came
to
a
halt
when
our
motions
were
denied.
there
is
also
a
very
practical
problem
that
arizona
some
day
must
face,
and
that
is
that
there
is
so
much
indian
land
in
the
state
that
if
the
practicable
irrigable
acreage
standard
is
to
be
applied
throughout
the
state,
then
the
existing
water
supply
could
only
supply
one-third
of
the
indian
reservation
lands,
and
none
of
the
non-indian
lands,
and
we
feel
that
this
issue,
too,
could
be
visited
if
the
'64
decree
is
construed
broadly
enough
to
allow
reopenings
of
the
type
that
is
sought
for
here.
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
mr.
justice
white,
they
have
not.
there
is--
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
--there
is
a
general
adjudication
on
some
of
the
reservations
that
is
in
process,
not
on
all.
at
this
time,
the
ninth
circuit
has
ruled
that
the
arizona
enabling
act
precluded
it
from
adjudicating
indian
water
rights,
and
my
understanding
is
that
this
court
has
accepted
certiorari
with
respect
to
that
issue.
that
is
now
before
this
court
from
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
well,
their...
okay.
i
should
explain
that,
mr.
justice
white.
they
have...
there
are
cases
going
on
in
the
state
courts,
and
there
were
cases
going
on
in
the
federal
courts.
the
district
courts
in
the
state
of
arizona
ruled
that
under
the
mccarren
act
it
was
proper
that
the
state
courts
adjudicate
these
issues,
and
so
they
referred
the
federal
court
proceedings
to
the
state
courts.
the
united
states
and
the
indian
tribes
there
involved
appealed
those
decisions
to
the
ninth
circuit,
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
now
held
that
arizona
may
not
adjudicate,
not
because
of
the
mccarren
act
or
any
of
its
holdings,
but
because
of
the
constitution,
which
has
some
language
in
it
with
respect
to
divesting
arizona
of
jurisdiction
over
indian
lands.
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
i
am
sorry.
i
missed
your
question.
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
question
of
the
constitution
has
been
presented.
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
mr.
justice
white,
we
have--
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
--we
have
great
concerns
that
the
state
courts
or
the
federal
district
court
would
feel
bound
by
the
standard
set
forth
by
this
court
because
it
was
instigated
by
the
state
courts.
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
well,
that's
the
thing
that
we
feel
there
is
some
uncertainty
about.
we
feel
that
the
moderate
living
standard
is
a
further
definition,
and
that
that
should
be
applied.
we
would,
of
course,
on
behalf
of
the
state
urge
that
application
before
any
state
court
or
district
court
in
the
federal
courts.
however,
we
are
not
certain
that
this
would
be
applied,
but
it
does
present
us
with
a
dilemma
and
a
problem,
and
we
feel
again
that
if
article
ix
permits
the
reopening
of
the
type
here,
then
that
would
permit
a
reopening
for
purposes
of
looking
at
whether
or
not
the
standard
should
be
applied
in
a
state
where
it
obviously
cannot
work.
in
the
remaining
time
available
to
me,
i
would
like
to
just
for
a
moment
approach
the
question
of
some
factual
exceptions
that
we
made.
i
will
not
go
into
detail
on
these,
because
time
does
not
permit,
and
further,
i
think
the
court
will
see
what
we
have
asserted
in
the
briefs,
but
i
would
like
to
simply
say
that
some
of
the
legal
questions
with
respect
to
the
factual
issues
are
as
follows,
and
some
of
the
factual
questions.
this
court
may
not
wish
to
reweigh
all
of
the
evidence
from
this
lengthy
trial,
but
we
did
except
to
some
of
the
findings
of
special
master
tuttle,
and
as
to
the
united
states
claims,
the
errors
relate
to
the
lands
which
even
the
united
states
experts
projected
to
be
only
marginally
profitable,
but
they
based
such
projections
on
yields
and
production
costs
and
power
rates
that
we
feel
are
not
properly
established
in
the
evidence
and
resulted
in
a
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
states
rather
than
the
master
requiring
the
burden
of
proof
to
be
carried
by
the
united
states.
as
to
the
indian
tribe
claims,
the
errors,
we
submit,
relate
to
lands
which
the
master
found
profitable,
and
thus
deserving
of
a
permanent
water
right
based
only
on
the
projection
of
what
we
have
termed
exotic
crops,
crops
without
a
commercial
history,
unproven
in
the
area.
in
fact,
one
of
the
crops
happened
to
be
grapes,
and
there
have
been
some
attempts
at
grape
growing
in
the
lower
colorado
river
basin,
and
they
did
not
last,
and
have
not
carried
on
to
be...
have
not
proven
to
be
profitable.
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
well,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
it
is
proposed
essentially
now
on
all
reservations,
because
of
the
problem
of
drip
and
sprinkler
irrigation
which
i
talked
about,
but
there
was
considerable
evidence
in
particular
about
that
on
the
fort
yuma
reservation.
mr.
ralph
hunsaker
yes,
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
the
area
where
there
was
some
evidence
with
respect
to
some
attempts
at
grape
growing
that
did
not
last
on
the
monsanto
ranch
near
that
area.
but
the
master
with
respect
to
crop
prices
used
a
method
that
was
not
employed
by
any
of
the
experts
in
the
case,
including
those
hired
by
the
indian
tribes,
and
also
did
not
take
into
account
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
as
to
what
size
market
must
be
looked
at
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
a
new
grape
acreage
could
be
brought
into
production
and
not
affect
the
market
prices
to
be
received.
