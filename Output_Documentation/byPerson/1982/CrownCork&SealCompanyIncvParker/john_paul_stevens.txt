mr.
solter,
may
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
do
you
do
with
the
plaintiff,
prospective
plaintiff
who
seeks
to
intervene
not
as
a
right
but
intervention
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
and
the
trial
judge
decides
he
won't
allow
intervention,
not
because
of
time
bar
but
just
because
he
doesn't
think
it
is
an
appropriate
case
to...
he
doesn't
want
to
complicate
his
own
lawsuit
with
this
group
of
intervenors?
would
you
say
they
are
also
barred?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
asking
if
he
denied
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assume
he
was
literally
within
the
class
described
by
the
plaintiff,
but
when
it
came
around
to
certifying
the
class,
the
judge
decided
the
commonality
or
typicality
reason
for
not
certifying
a
class
and
then
he
also
decided
not
to
allow
intervention
because
he
thought
it
would
delay
the
proceeding,
allow
too
many
people
to
come
in.
what
do
you
do...
how
does
your
rule
deal
with
that
kind
of
a
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
his
only
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
fourth
circuit
rule
would
protect
him
though
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
should
think
we
would
always
have
a
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
would
be
within
the
description
of
the
class
representative,
within
the
class
described
in
the
complaint,
but
not
within
the
class
the
trial
judge
was
willing
to
certify.
you
have
got
kind
of
concentric
circles
almost
and
he
is
within
the
outer
ring.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
if
he
doesn't
get
within
the
class
that
is
actually
certified,
then
he
does
not
get
the
benefit
of
the
tolling
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ramsey,
that
also
would
have
been
true
if
they
had
certified
the
class,
isn't
it?
they
would
have
been
stuck
with
the
developments
in
that
lawsuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
denied
discovery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
are
arguing
it
is
unfair
to
make
the
non-party
accept
the
bad
features
of
the
litigation,
but
unless
he
files
his
own
lawsuit,
he
is
going
to
do
that
if
the
class
is
eventually
certified.
he,
in
effect,
seems
to
be
content
with
the
class
until
the
certification
ruling
is
adverse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
seems
to
me
there
is
a
little
inconsistency
in
your
position.
i
may
not
get
it
entirely.
