justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
solter,
in
the
category
that
you
are
talking
to
justice
stevens
about,
doesn't
your
position
encourage
perhaps
the
unnecessary
filing
of
a
bunch
of
complaints
in
anticipation
that
this
problem
might
arise
and
isn't
that
as
burdensome
or
moreso
than
the
protective
motions
to
intervene
that
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
american
pipe?
