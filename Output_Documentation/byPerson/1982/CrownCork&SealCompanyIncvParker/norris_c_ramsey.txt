mr.
norris
c.
ramsey
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court:
it
is
the
respondent's
position
that
the
fourth
circuit's
ruling
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
for
the
tolling
rule
as
announced
in
american
pipe.
first,
i
shall
discuss
the
policy
considerations.
the
effect
on
rule
23
if
the
court
were
to
limit
the
putative
class
member
to
intervention
into
the
cause
action.
second
would
be
the
practical
effect
of
limiting
it
to
intervention.
third
would
be
the
effects
of
the
broad
interpretation
of
the
tolling
rule
on
rule
23.
fourth,
the
effect
on
the
case
at
bar,
and
fifth,
the
fact
that
the
interpretation
given
to
the
tolling
rule
by
the
fourth
circuit
is
consistent
with
this
court's
dictum
in
eisen
and
the
fact
that
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
limitations
rule
on
the
statute,
for
purpose
of
statute
of
limitations
is
also
consistent
with
the
tolling
rule.
and,
finally,
that
the
90-day
notice
of
right
to
sue
is
a
statute
of
limitations
as
opposed
to
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite.
the
policy
reasons
for
the
american
pipe
tolling
rule
is
to
prevent
premature
filings
of
motions
to
intervene
into
the
class
action
before
the
class
certification
issue
has
been
decided.
if
the
court
were
to
limit
the
putative
class
member
to
intervening
into
the
existing
cause
of
action,
then
that
would
undermine
the
policy
considerations
of
judicial
economy
and
efficiency.
it
might
make
the
purported
class
action
unmanageable
by
the
filing
of
numerous
separate
lawsuits
in
different
jurisdictions
and
numerous
and
multiple
motions
to
intervene
into
the
class
before
the
class
certification
issue
has
been
decided.
moreover,
the
court
should
pay
close
attention
to
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
24a
and
rule
24b
in
this
case.
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
24a
gives
the
intervenor
a
right
to
intervene,
whereas,
rule
24b
allows
the
court
to
exercise
its
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
the
putative
class
member
would
be
able
to
intervene
into
the
cause
of
action.
knowing
this,
any
smart
lawyer
or
smart
putative
class
member
would
move
to
intervene
on
a
timely
basis
prior
to
the
motion
for
class
certification
being
denied
and
again
thus
undermining
the
purpose
of
the
tolling
rule.
the
practical
considerations
for
requiring
intervention
only
would
have...
a
decision
to
require
intervention
only
would
have
as
a
practical
matter
an
adverse
impact
on
the
putative
class
member.
that
is
the
putative
class
member
would
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
party
plaintiff.
when
he
steps
into
the
shoes
of
the
party
plaintiffs,
he
inherits
all
of
the
procedural
errors,
discovery
errors,
and
other
problems
inherent
in
intervening
into
a
cause
of
action
where
litigation
has
already
taken
place.
thus,
again,
this
would
serve
to
encourage
the
intervenor
to
intervene
pursuant
to
rule
24a
prior
to
the
motion
for
class
certification
being
decided.
mr.
norris
c.
ramsey
yes,
your
honor.
a
significant
amount
of
discovery
generally
occurs
in
that
in
cases
of
this
nature,
such
as
title
vii
class
actions,
the
motion
is
generally
decided
on
statistical
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
pattern
and/or
practice
of
discrimination
that
has
been
practiced
against
a
class.
in
addition,
the
class
plaintiff
may
have
also
attempted
to
discover
evidence
concerning
disparate
treatment
of
class
members.
and,
in
fact,
in
the
case
at
bar,
after
the
class
certification
issue
had
been
decided,
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
the
main
plaintiffs
in
the
class
action
would
be
allowed
to
go
into
the
employer's
personnel
files
for
purposes
of
discovering
evidence
concerning
disparate
treatment.
if
the
district
court
had
made
an
adverse
decision
to
the
class
plaintiffs
and
denied
them
the
right
to
seek
that
evidence,
then
the
respondent
parker,
having
intervened
at
that
state
in
the
litigation,
he
would
have
been
deprived
of
evidence
to
carry
his
burden
of
proof
on
the
merits.
mr.
norris
c.
ramsey
well,
if
the
court
had
certified
a
class,
the--
mr.
norris
c.
ramsey
--and
then
denied
discovery,
then
they
would
have
been
faced
with
that
problem,
although
we
believe
the
district
court
would
have
been
wrong
in
that
eisen
versus
carlisle
&
jacquelin
teaches
that
the
court
should
not
go
into
the
merits
when
determining
whether
or
not
a
case
should
be
certified
as
a
class
action.
mr.
norris
c.
ramsey
well,
at
that
point,
he
may
be
able
to
move
to
intervene
pursuant
to
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
24a
on
the
grounds
of
inadequacy
of
representation
in
that
the
main
plaintiffs
would
not
have
sought
sufficient
discovery
to
have
the
case
determined
on
its
merits.
mr.
norris
c.
ramsey
well,
further,
the
other
practical
effects
on
the
case
would
be
that
requiring
a
putative
class
member
to
intervene
into
an
existing
cause
of
action
may
not
be
financially
feasible
in
that
should
the
court
have
before
it
a
nationwide
class
action
individuals
located
in
jurisdictions
far
from
the
original
jurisdiction
may
not
be
able
to
financially
afford
to
hire
attorneys
and
litigate
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction.
moreover,
if
there
was
a
nationwide
class
action,
then
the
individuals,
by
being
required
to
file
to
intervene,
may
be
required
to
litigate
in
a
jurisdiction
in
which
witnesses,
documents,
and
other
factors
related
to
this
litigation
would
not
be
present
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction.
for
example,
an
employer,
as
counsel
stated,
may
have
plants
in
separate
jurisdictions
throughout
the
country.
that
is
where
those
personnel
files
would
be
located.
that
is
where
the
supervisors
would
be
located.
and,
thus--
mr.
norris
c.
ramsey
--i
believe
that
is
discretionary
with
the
court.
the
court
may
appoint
lead
counsel
where
there
are
several
intervenors
or
it
may
allow
the
intervenor
to
keep
his
own
counsel.
in
all
instances,
the
court
would
probably
allow
the
intervenor
to
keep
his
own
counsel,
although
there
would
be
lead
counsel
for
purposes
of
carrying
out
the
major
phases
of
the
litigation.
now,
after
the
class
certification
issue
has
been
denied,
then,
of
course,
there
is
no
longer
any
interest
in
protecting
judicial
economy
and
efficiency,
because
the
purpose
of
that
rule
in
the
first
place
was
to
disencourage
premature
motions
to
intervene
into
the
class
action
and
the
filing
of
separate
lawsuits.
of
course,
once
the
court
decides
adversely
to
the
class;
that
is
that
there
should
not
be
a
class
certification,
then
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
24b
comes
into
place.
that
rule
allows
discretionary
intervention.
and,
should
this
court
limit
the
putative
class
members
to
intervening
into
the
existing
cause
of
action,
then
it
is
possible
that
the
putative
class
member
could
lose
his
lawsuit
on
the
grounds
unrelated
to
the
merits
of
his
cause
of
action.
that
is
the
court
could
decide
that
the
motion
pursuant
to
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
24b
was
untimely,
that
it
may
cause
undue
delay
in
the
original
cause
of
action,
and,
thus,
deny
the
putative
class
member
the
right
to
intervene,
and,
thus,
his
day
in
court.
as
a
practical
matter,
deciding
that
the
american
pipe
tolling
rule
should
be
given
a
broad
interpretation
and
allow
separate
lawsuits
or
intervention
would
not
undermine
the
purpose
of
rule
23.
should
separate
lawsuits
be
filed,
then
the
court,
pursuant
to
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
42a
could
consolidate
all
like
and
related
causes
of
action
for
purposes
of
pre-trial
litigation,
for
purposes
of
trial,
or
he
may
pass...
the
court
may
pass
any
other
orders
it
deems
necessary
to
effect
judicial
economy
and
efficiency.
should
there
be
several
lawsuits
filed
in
separate
jurisdictions,
then
the
court
on
motion
by
any
party,
the
employer
as
well
as
the
intervenors,
may
coordinate
the
litigation
through
the
multi-district
litigation
panel,
and,
thus,
conduct
all
pre-trial
proceedings
so
that
there
will
not
be
unnecessary
burdens
and
expenses
on
the
employers,
the
court,
or
the
litigants.
and,
once
the
pre-trial
phases
of
the
litigation
has
been
completed,
the
panel
of
multi-district
litigation
then
can
remand
the
case
back
to
the
particular
jurisdiction
in
which
the
lawsuit
was
originally
filed
for
trial.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
petitioner
was
not
prejudiced
at
all.
this
is
said
because
the
respondent
here
filed
a
charge
of
discrimination
with
eeoc
which
then
put
the
petitioner
on
notice
as
to
the
claim
of
the
respondent,
that
he
was
complaining
that
there
was
discrimination
against
him
on
the
basis
of
his
race.
and,
indeed,
as
counsel
pointed
out,
there
was
an
investigation
conducted
by
the
maryland
commission
on
human
relations
and
eeoc
finding
no
probable
cause
in
which
the
employer
participated.
second,
as
the
district
court
opinion
points
out,
the
respondent
here
was
a
member
of
the
putative
class
and
the
petitioner
had
been
placed
on
notice
as
to
the
type
of
claims
that
the
respondent
had.
in
fact,
the
class
had
been
shaped
by
discovery
and
members
of
the
putative
class
had
been
named
in
the
record
so
they
actually
knew
the
identity
of
each
putative
class
member.
moreover,
once
the
respondent
had
filed
his
own
lawsuit,
he
moved
to
consolidate
his
lawsuit
with
the
case
that
had
been
filed
as
a
class
action.
to
say
that
the
difference
between
intervention
and
consolidation
is
to...
it
would
be
to
exalt
form
over
substance
by
saying
that
consolidation
and
intervention
would
be
different.
mr.
norris
c.
ramsey
the
reasons
were
because
being
experienced
with
that
litigation
and
being
counsel
in
both
cases,
i
was
aware
of
the
pre-trial
discovery
and
difficulties
that
had
gone
on
in
that
particular
case
and
not
wanting
my
client
to
be
bound
by
those
difficulties,
then
i
opted
to
file
a
separate
lawsuit
and
then
move
to
consolidate
those
lawsuits
based
on
my
experience
in
other
cases
where
class
actions
had
been
filed
and
separate
lawsuits
had
been
filed
and
the
district
court
allowed
the
separate
lawsuit
to
engage
in
his
own
discovery,
to
complete
his
own
discovery
for
purposes
of
trial.
so,
there
was
a
practical
reason
for
doing
that.
the
respondent
submits
that
the
fourth
circuit's
interpretation
of
american
pipe
to
allow
the
filing
of
a
separate
lawsuit
is
consistent
with
this
court's
dictum
in
eisen
versus
carlisle
&
jacquelin.
there
the
court
rejected
the
argument
that
class
members
would
not
opt
out
of
a
class
action
because
the
limitations
period
would
have
run,
citing
american
pipe.
we
believe
that
the
only
fair
reading
of
that
dictum
is
that
a
class
member
would
opt
out
for
purposes
of
filing
a
separate
lawsuit
since
a
putative
class
member
would
not
opt
out
of
a
class
only
to
move
to
intervene
into
that
same
lawsuit
again.
furthermore,
we
believe
that
the
tolling
of
the
statute
of
limitations
for
purposes
of
separate
lawsuits
or
intervention
is
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
purpose
of
a
statute
of
limitation
is
to
promote
justice
by
preventing
unfair
surprise
through
the
recovery
of
stale
claims
that
have
been
allowed
to
slumber
until
evidence
has
been
lost,
memories
faded,
or
witnesses
disappeared.
here,
where
a
case
has
been
filed
as
a
class
action,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
defendant
or
employer
to
retain
its
records
and
documents.
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
employer
or
defendant
to
prepare
its
case
for
trial
and
retain
the
necessary
evidence.
therefore,
the
purpose
of
a
statute
of
limitations
would
not
be
undermined
by
such
a
tolling
rule.
finally,
the
defendants...
the
petitioner
argues
that
the
90-day
period
for
bringing
a
lawsuit
is
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
as
opposed
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
respondent
submits
that
this
court
in
zipes
versus
trans
world
airlines
has
addressed
that
issue
to
a
large
extent.
it
pointed
out
in
that
decision
that
the
limitation
periods
under
title
vii
have
always
been
referred
to
by
this
court
as
statutes
of
limitations
subject
to
waiver,
estoppel,
and
tolling.
moreover,
a
reading
of
42
usc
section
2000e-5(f)(3),
the
jurisdictional
section
of
title
vii,
does
not
mention
the
90-day
limitations
period.
it
would
seem
that
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
concedes
that
this
case
involves
a
statute
of
limitations
as
opposed
to
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
in
that
it
admits
that
american
pipe
applies
and
if
american
pipe
applies,
then
there
was
a
tolling
of
the
statute
of
limitations
during
the
pendency
of
the
class
action.
in
conclusion,
the
respondent
submits
that
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
american
pipe
rule
to
allow
separate
lawsuits
or
intervention
is
consistent
with
rule
23;
that
is
to
promote
judicial
economy
and
efficiency.
we
submit
that
it
would
undermine
the
purpose
of
the
tolling
rule
and
encourage
the
filing
of
pre-certification
motions
to
intervene
and
separate
lawsuits
should
this
court
decide
otherwise.
thank
you.
