mr.
george
d.
solter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
blanket
application
of
equitable
tolling
by
the
application
of
a
blanket
equitable
tolling
the
defendant
should
be
subjected
to
a
second
wave
of
separate,
individual
lawsuits
by
putative
members
of
the
class
after
the
denial
of
class
certification.
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
not
only
permits
this,
but
also
makes
it
possible
for
such
individuals
to
file
their
complaints
as
class
actions,
thus
beginning
the
tolling
cycle
once
again.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
fourth
circuit
rule
announced
in
this
case
is
not
supported
by
case
law,
is
an
intrusion
upon
legislative
prerogative
and
is
inconsistent
with
legislative
purpose
in
establishing
time
requirements
for
filing.
it
violates
the
integrity
of
rule
23,
expands
rather
than
limits
litigation
arising
out
of
class
actions,
and
overlooks
the
jurisdictional
aspect
of
the
90-day
period
prescribed
in
title
vii.
we
further
submit
that
there
are
no
facts
in
this
case
which
warrant
equitable
tolling
for
the
individual
respondent
and
there
is
no
basis
in
fact
in
this
case
or
in
law
for
the
adoption
of
the
broad
rule
extending
the
tolling
of
american
pipe
versus
utah
to
individual
private
actions
after
class
certification
has
been
denied.
now,
on
the
surface,
it
might
appear
that
there
is
little
difference
between
intervention
as
prescribed
by
american
pipe
and
a
separate,
individual
lawsuit
after
class
certification
has
been
denied.
in
order
to
examine
the
difference
and
illustrate
the
differences,
it
is
necessary
to
see
just
what
the
fourth
circuit
tolling
rule
does
by
extending
it
to
the
private
individual
action.
by
the
mere
filing
of
a
complaint
in
the
district
court,
entitled
a
vii.
secondly,
and
perhaps
the
most
frightening
part
of
it
is
that
it
really
has
the
effect
of
placing
the
tolling
power
in
the
hands
of
lawyers
and
plaintiffs
and
not
in
the
hands
of
the
courts
and
this
is
done
by
the
use
of
a
broad
class
definition
in
the
initial
complaint,
because
in
american
pipe,
the
filing
of
a
complaint
is
what
tolls
the
statute.
it
is
illustrated
by
this
case
in
the
complaint
filed
by
the
two
alleged
class
members
which
the
respondent
seeks
to...
seek
the
benefit
from,
define
the
class
as
this:
black
persons
who
have
been,
continue
to
be,
or
may
in
the
future
will
be
denied
equal
employment
opportunities
by
the
defendant.
that
is
from
the
first
such
person
that
was
ever
hired
to
infinity.
there
is
no
limitation
in
that
definition
as
to
time,
as
to
the
location.
it
wasn't
restricted
to
the
baltimore
plant
and
this
company
has
plants
in
26
states
of
the
united
states.
there
is
nothing
to
limit
it
by
definition
as
to
the
nature
of
the
discrimination
or
any
other
circumstance.
it
simply
refers
to
this
gigantic
class
of
persons
in
a
very
general
sense.
now,
this
danger
was
recognized
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
american
pipe
where
it
was
warned
that
it
should
not
be
interpreted
as
an
encouragement
to
lawyers
to
frame
overly
broad
issues...
i
mean,
overly
broad
definitions
to
attract
members.
we
also
feel
finally
that
it
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
90-day
notice
in
title
vii.
in
that
notice,
under
the
law,
actual
service
of
the
notice
upon
the
complainant
after
eeoc
waives
its
jurisdiction
is
mandated.
the
time
does
not
begin
to
run
until
he
actually
has
possession
of
that
notice
and
that
notice,
as
is
shown
in
the
appendix,
is
extremely
explicit.
it
is
not
something
that
he
is
supposed
to
know
about
in
the
sense
of
when
statutes
start
to
run
or
filing
times
start
to
run.
he
must
know
about
it
immediately
by
reading
that
notice
or
having
someone
read
it
to
him.
there
are
no
exceptions
carved
out
in
the
statute
for
any
other
different
period
or
any
changing
of
that
period
and
it
seems
extremely
explicit
even
though
this
is
a
remedial
statute
and
we
all
recognize
the
rule
of
liberal
construction
when
we
are
referring
to
remedial
statutes.
the
important
relevant
facts
in
this
case
to
remember
are
simply
these:
that
the
respondent,
after
having
timely
filed
his
complaint
with
the
eeoc,
sat
back
as
he
had
to
to
await
the
result.
while
that
was
being
investigated,
two
other
gentlemen
from
crown,
who
were
black
employees
who
had
been
terminated,
filed
a
class
action
known
as
pendleton
and
allen,
and
they
used
the
broad
definition
which
is
have
just
referred
to.
that
occurred
on
september
15,
1978.
approximately
two
months
later
the
eeoc
issued
its
no
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
discrimination
had
occurred
and
the
90-day
notice
to
sue.
mr.
parker
did
nothing.
in
the
meantime,
two
years
went
by
and
finally
the
district
court,
after
hearing
and
after
a
period
of
holding
the
matter
sub
curia,
decided
that
class
certification
should
be
denied.
that
occurred
on
september
4,
1980,
within
two
months.
which
was
timely
in
the
sense
of
the
90
days
if
there
is,
in
fact,
a
tolling,
mr.
parker
filed
his
own
private
individual
suit.
time
went
on.
of
course,
he
was
met
with
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
crown
which
brings
the
case
ultimately
here
today.
also,
when
he
was
met
with
the
summary
judgment
motion,
three
days
later,
he
filed
a
motion
to
intervene
in
the
parker-pendleton
class
action
which
had
been...
in
which
certification
had
been
denied
many,
many
months
before.
he
filed
it
under
the
concept
of
united
airlines
versus
mcdonald
in
order
to
appeal
the
denial
of
the
class
action.
he
did
not
intervene
in
a
timely
fashion
under
american
pipe
to
become
a
party
in
the
remaining
litigation.
now,
with
those
facts
as
the
background,
it
is
particularly
significant
to
us
and
we
submit
should
be
to
the
court
that
here
the
respondent
had
actual
notice
of
the
filing
time
when
he
received
his
notice
from
the
eeoc.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
relied
on
the
existence
of
the
pendleton-allen
class
action,
even
though
that
is
alleged
in
the
brief,
because
he
went
back
to
eeoc
in
1980
and
tried
to
get
another
fresh
90-day
notice
of
right
to
sue
in
order
to
give
substance
to
his
new
filing.
of
course--
mr.
george
d.
solter
--no,
i
don't.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
is
considered
in
the
discussion;
that
the
people
who
do
know
about
it
are
entitled
to
rely
on
it
for
the
purposes
outlined
in
american
pipe,
namely,
to
intervene.
in
other
words,
if
they
decide
to
stay
out
and
they
are
aware
of
it,
then
obviously
they
are
relying
on
it
and
they
come
in
to
intervene.
mr.
george
d.
solter
if
they
knew
of
it,
but,
of
course,
american
pipe
extended
to
those
inactive
and
unknown
members
as
well
who
might
subsequently
learn
of
the
class
action
and
the
fact
that
it
was
not
certified
and
file
in
time.
it
covered
all
of
the
members,
potential
members,
of
the
putative
class
whether
they
had
knowledge
and
relied
or
whether
they
gained
knowledge
at
a
later
time.
the
respondent
in
this
case
did
take
advantage
of
his
right
to
intervene
for
purposes
of
appeal
under
united
airlines
versus
mcdonald
and
then,
for
one
reason
or
another,
after
having
been
given
that
right
to
intervene
and
file
the
appeal,
the
appeal
was
not
timely
filed
and
that
was
the
end
of
that.
we
submit
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
provided
a
fifth
alternative
to
a
situation
where
the
respondent,
under
the
scheme
of
title
vii,
had
already
four
alternatives.
he
could
have
filed
timely
if
he
wanted
to
go
his
own
individual
way.
he
had
the
notice,
he
could
have
filed
timely.
he
admitted
having
received
it
and
having
taken
it
to
an
attorney.
he
also
admitted
having
gone
back
to
eeoc
after
receiving
it
for
further
explanation.
he
could
have
moved
to
intervene
in
the
pendleton-allen
case
while
class
status
was
pending.
he
could
have
moved
to
intervene
in
a
timely
fashion
after
class
certification
was
denied,
but
he
did
not.
and,
he
could
have
moved
to
appeal
the
denial
of
class
certification,
which
he
did,
but,
of
course,
then
lost
that
by
failing
to
file
in
the
fourth
circuit
a
timely
appeal.
mr.
george
d.
solter
oh,
yes,
i
think
that
is
the
whole
point.
the
reason
for
intervention
that
was
prescribed
in
the
american
pipe
case
was
to
keep
control
over
the
litigation
in
the
same
court,
in
the
same
district,
rather
than
to
allow
the
individuals,
as
they
can
now
under
this
rule
if
it
is
adopted,
to
go
out
and
file
their
own
private
actions.
mr.
george
d.
solter
well,
i
got
my
numbers
mixed
up.
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
the
actual
intervention
in
the
case
before
the
appeal
stage,
while
it
was
still
viable
to--
mr.
george
d.
solter
--what
he
did
in
this
case
you
mean?
mr.
george
d.
solter
well,
i
did
mean
to
make
that
distinction,
because
after
denial
of
certification,
he
can...
the
statute
starts
to
run
again
under
american
pipe
and
he
is
provided
the
opportunity
to
then
intervene
provided
he
does
it
within
the
time
left
to
him
on
whatever
statute
it
is.
so,
that
is
one
alternative.
mr.
george
d.
solter
precisely.
and,
that
is
why
i
am
arguing
that
that
is
the
route
that
should
be
followed
and
not
to
go
out
with
his
private
action
and
institute
another
case
outside
of
the
framework
of
the
class
action
which
is
really
the
whole
basis
on
which
the
american
pipe
case
was
placed
as
i
read
it.
and,
that
was
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
rule
23,
to
protect
the
class
as
a
whole,
inactive
and
uninformed
as
well
as
those
who
relied,
and
to
control
the
individual
claims
through
rule
24,
the
intervention
route,
rather
than
to
have
the
independent
actions
going
on.
and,
here
is
where
the
reason
for
intervention
is
so
necessary.
when
someone
tries
to
intervene
in
a
case
of
this
kind
after
the
denial,
in
order
to
intervene
and
get
the
benefit
of
the
tolling,
they
have
to
show
that
first
there
really
was
a
class
of
some
kind
and,
secondly,
that
they
were
a
member
of
it
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
tolling.
and
that
is
where
i
think
the
district
court
should
have
the
power
to
control
rather
than
if
an
individual
action
is
filed
and
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
filed
on
the
basis
of
limitations,
to
then
hold
another,
almost
a
de
novo
hearing
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
potential
class
and
whether
this
man
or
woman
was
a
member
of
that
class.
the
whole
idea
of
american
pipe
was
to
use
rule
23
to
keep
the
litigation
in
some
orderly
fashion
controlled
so
that
the
matter
could
be
managed
in
a
proper
way
and
a
practical
way.
and,
after
all,
the
decisions
that
are
rendered
are
for
the
district
courts
to
follow
and
to
help
them
in
implementing
their
court
calendar.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
why
this
point
was
made
so
firmly
in
american
pipe
where
it
said
it
was
limited
for
the
purposes
of
intervention.
also,
there
is
another
question
that
is
raised
by
the
language
of
american
pipe
where
tolling
was
limited
at
least
where
the
denial
of
class
certification
was
solely
for
the
lack
of
numerosity.
the
reason
for
that
was
that
in
that
case
there
was
a
class
clearly
established
but
there
weren't
enough
members
to
satisfy
rule
23
and,
therefore,
there
was
a
clear
finding
that
joinder
was
practical
and,
therefore,
the
next
logical
thing
that
follows
is
if
joinder
is
practical,
then
intervention
is
the
next
step.
now,
if
certification
was
denied
for
lack
of
typicality
or
commonality,
there
is
a
good
chance
there
is
no
class
there
at
all
underlying
the
action
or
at
best
it
is
a
very
narrow
class
and,
therefore,
intervention,
as
opposed
to
a
private
suit,
provides
the
mechanism
for
screening
out
non-meritorious
claims.
it
keeps
the
litigation
in
the
same
court
in
a
fairly
timely
fashion,
because
members
would
have
to
act
promptly
because
their
statute
is
running
out,
so
that
everything
is
fresh,
it
is
all
in
one
place,
and
not
scattered
in
many
districts
perhaps
where
a
defendant
may
have
a
different
plant
so
there
would
be
venue
there.
mr.
george
d.
solter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
d.
solter
well,
i
would
say
that
if
the
judge
granted
it
on
the
grounds
that
you
suggest,
it
might
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
under
the
rule,
but
if
he
granted--
mr.
george
d.
solter
--if
he
denied
it?
mr.
george
d.
solter
if
he
denied
intervention
because
he
felt
that
the
individual
had
failed
to
establish
that
he
was
a
member
of
a
class
or
that
there
was
such
a
class--
mr.
george
d.
solter
--well,
the
result,
i
think,
would
be
that,
first
of
all,
the
person
would
be
time
barred
because
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
then
claim
the
benefit
of
tolling.
but,
i
think
he
has...
that
would
constitute
a
final
order
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
and
he
would
have
a
right
of
appeal.
mr.
george
d.
solter
sir?
mr.
george
d.
solter
i
don't
think
any
more
so
necessarily
than
the
intervention
rule
would,
because
a
defendant
is
going
to
raise
the
limitations
issue
in
one
way
or
another,
even
in
the
private
action
that
the
fourt
circuit
advocates.
in
other
words,
you
would
still
have
to
come
in
and
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
based
on
limitations
and
then
there
would
have
to
be,
it
seems
to
me,
a
hearing
on
this
whole
question
of
class
status
for
his
to
reach
back
and
get
the
benefit
of
the
tolling.
this
isn't
something
that
is
handed
to
him.
he
gets
the
benefit
of
the
tolling
only
if
(a)
there
is
a
class,
and
(b)
he
is
a
potential
member
of
it.
and,
somewhere
down
the
road
there
has
got
to
be
proof
of
that.
so,
i
think
you
still
end
up
with
that
same--
mr.
george
d.
solter
--well,
that
is
true,
of
course,
but
the
purpose
of
the
motion
and
hearing
on
certification
is
to
narrow
it
and
try
to
determine
what
the
real
class--
mr.
george
d.
solter
--i
would
say
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
george
d.
solter
well,
obviously
there
is
the
risk
of
that
being
involved.
the
question
is
whether
it
really
amounts
to
anything
greater
by
going
the
intervention
route.
after
all,
if
a
potential
member
of
the
class
thinks
he
is
has
got
a
claim
and
he
belongs
in
this
class
and
he
wants
to
intervene,
he
has
to
make
these
showings.
and,
it
just
strikes
me
that
it
comes
back
to
the
question
of
control
and
management
at
the
trial
level
that
really
dictates
the
answer
to
the
problem.
now,
the
second
circuit
has
ruled
in
the
fashion
that
tolling
does
not
affect...
that
the
member
of
the
class
does
not
get
the
benefit
of
tolling
to
file
a
private
action,
he
only
can
intervene.
also,
the
ninth
circuit,
where
the
american
pipe
case
came
from
originally,
has
taken
that
view.
the
fourth
circuit
takes
the
other
view
and
that,
of
course,
is
why
we
are
here.
now,
under
rule
23,
which
this
court
placed
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
upon
in
the
american
pipe
case,
it
recognized
that
back
before
the
1966
amendment,
there
were
the
spurious
type
class
actions
which
where
unfair
advantage
could
be
obtained
by
persons
who
wanted
to
sit
on
the
sidelines
and
see
what
happened
and
not
be
bound
by
any
judgment.
and,
to
cure
this
effect,
rule
23
was
amended
and
it
provided
for
process,
among
other
things,
if
there
is
certification,
to
identify
the
members.
and,
american
pipe
recognized--
mr.
george
d.
solter
--yes,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
solter
i
am
sorry,
sir,
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
george
d.
solter
i
can't
recall
it,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
solter
i
think
that...
i
don't...
i
have
to
be
frank.
i
don't
recall
the
case,
but
from
what
you
say,
it
seems
that
that
was
one
of
maybe--
mr.
george
d.
solter
--the
problems
that
brought
about
amendments
to
rule
23
in
1966.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
last
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
george
d.
solter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
very
briefly,
it
seems
that
the
respondent
argues
that
equitable
tolling
should
be
looked
upon
as
some
sort
of
a
right.
this
court
and
all
courts
look
upon
equitable
tolling
as
something
that
is
given
only
sparingly,
almost
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
and
it
wasn't
until,
i
believe,
the
american
pipe
case
that
a
blanket
exercise
of
judicial
or
equitable
tolling
was
granted
so
that
it
covered
many,
many
people.
i
think
that
what
we
have
to
look
at
here
is
that
the
equitable
tolling
of
american
pipe
came
about
because
the
court
was
anxious
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
rule
23
and
that
it
saw
that
if
tolling
was
not
given
in
that
situation
many
people
would
be
harmed
and
would
not
have
an
opportunity
to
even
move
to
intervene
to
determine
whether
they
were
class
members
who
were
entitled
to
assert
a
private
action
after
the
denial
of
class
certification.
we
say
that
if
a
putative
member
of
the
class
wants
the
benefit
of
that
tolling,
he
must
bear
the
burden
of
that
tolling
by
showing
through
intervention
in
an
orderly,
manageable
fashion
before
the
same
court
that
he
is
a
member
of
that
class
and
that
the
class
existed.
otherwise,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
adopt
the
fourth
circuit
rule,
you
simply
open
the
door
for
an
entire
new
round
or
wave
of
litigation
in
courts
today
that
are
already
overly
swamped.
at
the
same
time,
the
intervenor
is
adequately
protected
by
the
technique
that
is
available
to
him
under
rule
24
where
he
can
come
before
this
court,
the
district
court,
and
assert
his
right
to
intervene
in
that
action.
we
simply
feel
that
this...
the
whole
purpose
of
the
american
pipe
tolling
rule
through
intervention
was
to
keep
the
power
to
control
and
direct
class
litigation
in
the
courts
and
not
in
the
hands
of
opportunistic
lawyers
and
litigants
where
abuses
could
occur.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
