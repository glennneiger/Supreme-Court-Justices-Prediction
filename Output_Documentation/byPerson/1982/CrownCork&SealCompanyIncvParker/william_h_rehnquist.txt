mr.
solter,
do
you
think
american
pipe
requires
reliance
at
least
to
the
putative
intervenors?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
very
fact
of
their
later
intervention
shows
they
probably
relied
on
the
existence
prior
to
the
refusal
to
certify?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
would
be
no
point
to
your
third
alternative,
would
there,
to
intervene
in
the
class
action
after
denial
of
class
certification?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
as
i
understood
your
fourth
alternative
was
to
intervene
in
an
appeal,
appeal
the
denial.
your
third
was
simply
to
intervene
after
refusal
to
certify.
and,
i
am
wondering,
what
is
the
point
to
that
if
you
don't
plan
to
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
meant
after
denial
of
certification.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
except
i
thought
you
were
posing
as
two
separate
alternatives
intervention
after
refusal
to
certify
for
purposes
of
appealing
and
simply
intervention
after
refusal
to
certify,
apparently
wanting
to
be
in
an
uncertified
class.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
when
he
does
that
he
is
simply
submitting
his
individual
claim
on
the
merits
really?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ramsey,
as
a
practical
matter,
can
you
say,
based
on
your
experience,
how
much
discovery
usually
takes
place
in
a
typical
class
action
case
before
the
class
certification
motion
is
ruled
upon?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ramsey,
is
it
customary
where
motions
to
intervene
in
a
class
action
have
been
filed
and
intervention
has
been
granted
that
each
of
the
intervenors
keeps
their
own
attorney
who
made
the
motion
to
intervene
on
their
behalf?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
any
particular
reason
that
you
chose
on
behalf
of
your
client
to
file
separately
and
then
move
to
consolidate
rather
than
to
intervene?
