ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
a
simple
straightforward
issue
is
being
presented
today
for
your
review.
the
issue
is
whether
a
county
may
constitutionally
receive
a
representative
to
its
state
house
of
representatives
based
merely
upon
its
status
as
a
county
and
without
regard
to
its
population.
in
addition
to
other
legal
considerations
which
will
be
presented
in
argument,
it
is
important
that
the
court
have
the
benefit
of
a
brief
factual
overview.
when
faced
with
the
decennial
task
of
reapportioning
its
legislative
membership
in
1981,
the
wyoming
state
legislature
determined
that
the
population
of
the
state
of
wyoming
had
grown
by
3...
pardon
me...
137,141
persons,
or
in
other
words
by
24
percent.
each
of
the
state's
23
counties
had
experienced
a
population
growth
but
one,
niobrara
county.
instead
the
population
of
that
county
had
stabilized
during
the
ten
year
period,
from
1970
to
1980,
at
2,924
persons.
as
introduced
in
the
house,
the
1981
reapportionment
act
provided
for
a
membership
of
63
members
in
the
house
of
representatives.
a
statutory
ratio
formula
based
upon
population
considerations
was
used
to
determine
which
counties
would
receive
representatives.
again--
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
--yes,
mr.
justice,
most
of
this
material
is
in
the
record.
based
upon
the
statutory
ratio
formula
each
of
the
state's
23
counties,
again
with
the
exception
of
one,
niobrara
county,
would
receive
at
least
one
representative.
the
1981
reapportionment
act
then
passed
the
house
of
representatives
providing
that
the
house
membership
would
continue
to
be
comprised
of
63
members,
but
niobrara
county
would
be
combined
with
its
neighboring
county
of
goshen.
the
senate,
however,
changed
the
1981
reapportionment
act
and
instead
provided
that
the
house
membership
should
be
increased
to
64.
the
additional
representative
would
be
awarded
to
niobrara
county.
the
act
then
was
committed
to
the
conference
committee
where
it
soon
became
very
apparent
that
the
committee
would
be
deadlocked
and
remain
deadlocked
unless
a
compromise
was
effected.
such
a
compromise
was
struck.
the
compromise
was
that
niobrara
county
would
receive
the
64th
member.
but
at
the
same
time
too,
if
any
court
determined
that
the
gratuitous
grant
of
a
representative
to
niobrara
county
was
unconstitutional,
then
niobrara
would
be
combined
with
goshen
county.
there
must
have
been
a
strong
realization
in
the
wyoming
state
legislature
that
there
would
be
a
strong
possibility,
a
probability,
that
the
provision
would
be
struck.
in
1964,
a
three-judge
panel,
in
the
case
of
schaefer
versus
thomson,
had
already
determined
that
article
3,
section
3,
of
the
wyoming
state
constitution
was
not
to
be
applied
in
future
instances
involving
apportionment
of
the
senate,
for
the
article
provided
that
each
county
would
constitute
a
senatorial
district.
and
each
county
would,
therefore,
receive
a
senator.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
mr.
justice,
we
attacked
it
just
as
to
the
one
county.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
although
there
was
an
awareness
that
the
whole
plan
was
probably
unconstitutional,
we
received
a
directive
from
our
clients
to
attack
only
that
portion
of
the
reapportionment
act
which
gave
niobrara
county
a
representative,
because
it
was
a
feeling
that
any
consideration
other
than
population
was
wrong
and
clearly
an
award
had
been
made
to
this
county
based
upon
its
status
as
a
political
subdivision.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
i
think
certainly
we
may
have
done
so
in
the
district
court
level.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
i
think,
mr.
justice,
we
go
back
to
the
fact
again
that
the
grant
was
given
purely
because
of
its
status
as
a
political
subdivision.
that
people's
voting
rights
were
diluted
substantially
in
giving
them
not
only
that
particular
sort
of
grant--
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
--i
can't
say
that.
that
is
not
true.
of
course,
we
care
about
the
rest
of
the
state,
and
so,
frankly,
do
our
clients.
but
at
that
time--
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
--maybe
if
i
can
give
you
some
background
that
that
would
be
instrumental.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
yes,
i
surely
will.
there,
of
course,
are
seven
named
plaintiffs
or
appellants
in
this
case,
each
of
whom
represent
one
of
the
most
populous
counties
in
the
state
of
wyoming.
in
addition,
these
ladies
represent
the
league
of
women
voters.
by
a
referendum
which
was
passed
by
the
league
of
women
voters
at
their
state
convention,
it
was
determined
that
the
one
grant,
the
one
county
grant
to
niobrara,
would
be
attacked.
it
was
also
too
a
feeling
of
that
group
that
they
would
be
unable
to
pass
a
broader
referendum
so
as
to
attack
the
whole
reapportionment
plan.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
yes,
it
is.
in
fact--
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
--hopefully,
i
had
explained
that
but
if
i
may
once
again.
what
happened
was
a
referendum
had
been
passed
by
the
league
of
women
voters
which
authorized
the
attack
of
only
that
one
portion
of
the
reapportionment
plan.
it
was
felt
by
the
membership
or
by
the
leadership
of
that
group
that
no
broader
authority
would
ever
be
given
because
of
the
political
ramifications
and
arguments
that
would
be
presented
by
the
membership
in
attacking
or
considering...
pardon
me...
that
broader
authority.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
yes,
that
is
in
fact
true.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
pardon
me?
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
no,
sir,
it
is
not.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
pardon
me,
again?
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
your
authority
goes
as
far
as
you
want
it
to
go,
and
certainly
my
clients
are
not
going
to
be
unhappy
if
your
decision
reaches
beyond
the
consideration
of
this
one
county.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
i
think
not,
mr.
justice.
and
i
go
back
to
two
decisions.
the
initial
decision
of
reynolds
versus
sims,
and
also
swann
versus
adams.
particularly
in
the
swann
case,
there
was
a
situation
where
this
court
looked
at
the
apportionment
of
the
senate,
although
only
one
issue
had
been
brought
to
the
court
for
its
attention,
the
reapportionment
plan
of
the
house.
and
the
court
in
that
case
determined
that
it
would
exceed
the
pleadings
and
it
would
address
the
issue
which
involved
the
senate.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
they
cannot.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
can.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
yes,
your
honor.
one
thing
that
is
important
for
you
to
understand
is
that
all
parties
stipulated
that
the
overall
relative
range
was
89
percent
in
the
64
plan
and
that
the
ratio
was
3.25
to
one,
while
the
63
plan
had
an
overall
relative
range
of
66
percent
and
a
ratio
of
2.09
to
one.
the
three-judge
panel,
of
course,
found
that
the
64
plan,
the
vote
dilution
suffered
by
the
appellants
below,
was
de
minimis
and
even
if
it
ware
or
were
not,
as
the
case
may
be,
that
there
were
rational
state
policies
which
would
justify
the
discrepancy.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
the
63
plan?
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
yes,
that
is
correct.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
no,
we
did
not,
mr.
justice.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
yes.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
the
overall--
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
--thank
you.
the
overall
relative
range
would
remain
the
same
under
the
63
plan
at
66
percent.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
that
would
be
the
difference
between
the
most
over-represented
county
and
the
most
under-represented
county,
which
would
be
washakie
as
being
the
most
under-represented,
and
sublette
as
being
the
most
over-represented
county.
in
this
instance,
niobrara
was
combined
with
a
contiguous
county,
goshen
county.
the
plaintiff's
complaint
was
dismissed
with
prejudice.
thereafter,
of
course,
this
appeal
ensued.
since
the
court,
in
the
1964
case,
reynolds
versus
sims,
held
that
both
houses
of
a
bicameral
state
legislature
must
be
apportioned
on
the
basis
of
equal
population,
the
reapportionment
law
has
been
more
clearly
defined
in
the
1973
cases
of
gaffney
versus
cummings,
white
versus
regester,
and
mahan
versus
howell.
the
first
two
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
if
the
overall
relative
range
of
a
reapportionment
plan
exceeds
9.9
percent,
then
a
prima
facie
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
has
been
deemed
to
have
occurred.
the
9.9
percent
hurtle
in
this
case
is
very
easy
to
jump.
the
overall
relative
range
of
the
64
plan
is
89
percent.
but
mahan
versus
howell
goes
one
step
further.
even
if
the
overall
relative
range
exceeds
the
minimum
9.9
percent
limitation,
the
state
can
save
the
reapportionment
plan
by
showing
that
there
are
legitimate
considerations
incident
to
the
effectuation
of
a
rational
state
policy.
basically
a
two-prong
test
applies.
first,
is
the
state's
policy
furthered
by
plan.
and
secondly,
if
it
is,
are
there
deviations...
are
the
deviations
within
acceptable
limitations?
this
court
has
found
that
neither
history,
topography,
geography,
sparseness
of
population,
vastness
of
area,
economic
considerations
like
tax
consequences
or
uniqueness,
are
factors
which
have
been
found
to
be
rational
state
policy.
in
mahan,
though,
the
integrity
of
maintaining
political
subdivisions
was
found
to
be
a
rational
state
policy,
yet
the
overall
relative
range
did
not
exceed
16.4
percent.
the
state
of
wyoming,
in
this
case,
hangs
its
hat
on
the
same
sort
of
rational
justification.
that
is,
that
the
maintenance
of
the
integrity
of
political
subdivisions
saves
the
64
plan.
there
are
other
factual
incidences,
though,
that
differentiate
this
case
from
the
mahan
case.
the
first
factor
which
is
necessary
to
consider
is
that
the
virginia
general
assembly
had
been
authorized
by
constitution
not
only
to
act
general
law,
but
to
act
specific
or
local
law
in
regard
to
the
government,
organization
and
powers
of
cities,
counties
and
towns.
that
sort
of
authority
is
specifically
prohibited
by
our
wyoming
state
constitution.
no
such
authority
is
given
to
our
wyoming
state
legislature.
lastly,
the
virginia
plan
produced
the
most
minimal
deviation
possible
while
keeping
the
counties
intact.
in
wyoming,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
showing
that
the
state
of
wyoming
had
made
an
honest
good-faith
effort
to
produce
the
minimal
deviations
possible.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
yes,
that
is
true.
if
we
want
back
and
used
the
smallest
county
as
the
most
basic
unit...
it
would
be
an
incremental
unit...
in
determining
membership
of
the
house,
it
would
well
exceed
three
hundred
members.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
that's
a
very
good
question.
if
i
may
i
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
these
examples.
appellant
margaret
brown
resides
in
carbon
county,
wyoming.
in
the
past
ten
years,
that
county
has
grown
by
approximately
7,500
persons.
the
county
received
the
same
amount
of
representation
that
it
did
in
1973,
three
members,
but
the
vote
dilution
which
has
occurred
there
is
on
a
scale
of
2.49
to
one.
in
other
words,
mrs.
brown's
vote
is
two
and
a
half
times
less
valuable,
if
you
will,
than
a
vote
cast
in
niobrara
county.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
if
i
understand
you
to
say,
what
is
the
impact
of
an
individual
voter,
statewide,
it
would
not
be
very
great.
if
i
may
though,
mr.
justice--
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
--i
think
not.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
i
think
it
is
not,
because
the
court
in
past
instances
have
said
that
any
time
a
vote
cast
in
one
part
of
a
state
is
worth
substantially
less
than
a
vote
cast
anywhere
else
in
the
state,
then
there
must
be
some
sort
of
tremendous
vote
dilution
which
has
occurred.
in
this
case,
we
find
that
the
maximum
vote
ratio
is
3.25
to
1.
in
other
words,
an
individual
in
washakie
county
who
casts
a
vote
finds
that
his
vote
is
worth
3.25
times
less
that,
than
a
vote
passed
in
niobrara
county.
i
think
even
more
in
point,
maybe
more
illustrative,
is
the
case
of
appellant
jane
maxwell,
who
lives
in
laramie
county,
my
county.
during
the
past
ten
years
the
county's
population
has
grown
by
12,000,
almost
12,500
people.
and
we
find
that
in
that
instance
that
only
has
that
county
not
maintained
the
original
legislative
grant...
or
in
other
words,
number
of
representatives...
of
11
that
it
had
in
1970,
but
during
the
past
decade,
because
of
population
shifts
and
such,
it
actually
lost
two
representatives.
you
compare
that
to
a
situation
where
the
county
has
grown
four
times
that
of
the
stagnant
population
of
niobrara
and
you
see
that
there
is
a
very
substantial
divergency
that
has
occurred.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
that
is
true.
it
would
not
get
back
the
two
representatives
which
the
county
has
lost.
but,
again,
we
look
to
the
fact
that
a
county
as
a
political
unit,
received
a
representative.
people
somehow
were
lost
in
the
shuffle.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
yes,
well,
there
are
two
considerations
which
our
wyoming
state
constitution
asks
us
to
look
at.
first,
as
i've
already
stated,
that
each
county
shall
constitute
a
representative
district,
while
at
the
same
time
in
the
very
same
provision,
our
constitution
provides
that
reapportionment
shall
occur
on
a
basis
of
population.
and
the
two
sort
of
thoughts
or
ideas
are
in
congress
in
this
case.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
i
think
it
would
not,
your
honor.
if...
if
i
may,
let
me
make
sure
i
understand.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
but,
mr.
justice,
you
still
are
limiting
who
can
be
qualified
to
sit
in
that
seat.
if
i
understand--
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
--we
are
also
very
concerned
that
the
county
of
niobrara
receives
a
seat,
and
niobrara
would
continue
to
receive
a
seat,
as
i
understand
your
hypothetical.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
i
don't
know
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
given
prior
rulings
of
this
court.
however,
it
would
be
very
unworkable
in
another
sense.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would--
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
--but,
again--
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
--sure.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
but,
again,
you
would
have
a
very
small
group
of
people,
the
citizens
of
niobrara,
who
would
be
receiving
one
representative.
and
i
think
that
that's
where
we
find
the
substantial
disparity
occurs.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
i
believe
a
more
accurate
statement
might
be,
mr.
justice,
that
niobrara
county
has
received
a
representative
since
the
county's
creation
in
1913.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
since
the
county's
creation
in
1913.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
yes,
but
there
were
different
factors
to
be
considered
at
that
point
of
time.
additionally,
those
courts
did
not
have
the
full
benefit
of
this
court's
most
recent
rulings.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
there
was
a
1964
case.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
yes,
it
was.
subsequent
to
that
there
was
1965
case
and
my...
maybe
giving
you
a
small
explanation...
the
1964
case
involved
the
attack
of
the
reapportionment
of
the
wyoming
state
house
and
state
senate.
the
court
found
that
the
wyoming
state
senate
plan
constituted
an
invidious
discrimination.
but
it
did
not
so
find
as
regards
the
wyoming
house
of
representatives.
it
continued
to
maintain
jurisdiction,
if
you
will,
of
the
case.
and,
later
in
1965,
when
the
legislature
took
no
action
to
remedy
the
inequities
that
were
apparent,
the
court
came
back
in
and
then
ordered
a
court
ordered
apportionment.
again
in
1971,
there
was
an
attack
on
the
wyoming
state
house
of
representatives.
the
court
again
found
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
interestingly
enough,
the
court
in
that
case
did
not
use
the
standards
of
measurement
which
this
court
had
endorsed.
instead,
it
looked
at
what
sort
of
changes
had
occurred
from
the
1965
court
ordered
plan,
and
found
that
there
was
no
discrimination
than
in
that
instance.
and
of
course
then
this
case
followed.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
yes,
your
honor,
there
was
one,
harrison
versus
schaefer
which
trailed
on
the
heels
of
the
1965
case.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
yes,
there
was.
if
i
may,
there's
one
other
distinguishing
factor,
again,
in
all
of
these
instances.
a
statutory
ratio
formula
was
used.
and
in
all
of
those
instances,
niobrara
county
was
found
to
justify
or
to
be
deserving
of
a
grant
one
legislator.
but
in
this
instance,
in
applying
the
statutory
ratio
formula,
we
find
that
it
does
not
have
enough
population
to
justify
a
representative.
the
statutory
formula
told
us
that
we
needed
to
round
to
the
nearest
whole
number,
and
any
time
that
that
whole
number...
pardon
me...
the
ratio
percentage
could
be
rounded
to
the
whole
number
of
one,
then
the
county
would
be
entitled
to
a
representative.
but
in
this
case,
the
only
way
that
niobrara's
percentage
could
be
rounded
was
down
to
zero,
so
it
deserved
none.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
i
believe
that
there
may
be
some
reference
in
the
record
as
to
the
political
makeup
of
niobrara
county.
and
as
i
recall,
your
honor,
if
your
specific
question
is
what
is
that
makeup,
that
they
have
a
republican
representative.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
republican.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
frankly,
your
honor,
i
don't
recall.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
no.
no,
there
is
no
claim
at
all
of
that.
if
i
may
capsulize,
appellants
pray
that
article
3,
section
3,
of
the
wyoming
state
constitution
and
the
64
plan
be
declared
unconstitutional
because
they
give
a
vote
to
a
county
and
not
to
people.
thank
you.
ms.
suellen
l.
davidson
of
course
it
is
the
appellant's
position
that
the
89
percent
overall
relative
range
is
a
per
se,
if
you
will,
violation
of
the
constitution.
greater
clarification
of
the
law
has
been
made
since
the
summary
affirmance
in
harrison
versus
schaefer.
an
old
outdated
mode
of
measurement
of
vote
dilution
has
been
used
or
has
been
propounded
by
the
state,
that
is,
that
a
minority
cannot
control,
basically,
the
legislature.
the
most
modern
and
accurate
measurements
are
brushed
to
the
wayside.
overall
relative
range
is
found
to
have
no
significance.
and
the
same,
too,
with
ratio.
where
is
the
breaking
point?
appellants
submit
that
it's
somewhere
around
the
16.4
percent
overall
relative
range
mark
that
was
set
forth
in
the
mahan
versus
howell
case.
even
more
remarkable
is
the
fact
that
that
breaking
point
has
been
exceeded
since
the
summary
affirmance
of
harrison
versus
schaefer
in
the
state
of
wyoming.
first
in
the
case...
in
the
1971
case,
thompson
versus
thomsom
and
then,
again,
in
this
case
brown
versus
thompson.
if
you
look
at
the
administrative
responsibilities
which
have
been
given
to
the
counties
as
political
subdivisions,
you
find
that
they
are
not
so
unlike
the
other
administrative
arms
of
states
which
are
found
in
the
majority
of
the
states
in
these
united
states.
some
reliance,
in
almost
all
of
those
instances,
is
based
on
revenue
and
taxation
considerations.
but
i
ask
the
court
to
remember
that
judicial
remedies
are
available
in
those
instances
where
a
county
may
be
discriminated
in
some
manner
by
virtue
of
a
vote
that's
taken
on
a
tax
bill
or
a
revenue
bill.
and
then,
if
you
will
look,
all
in
all,
one
64th
of
a
vote
makes
very,
very
little
difference
when
it
comes
to
a
matter
being
considered
typically
on
the
floor
of
a
legislature.
one
thing
i
think
that
this
court
would
find
to
be
of
interest
is
that
there
are...
there
is
at
least
one
instance
in
a
combination
district
where
the
minority
county
provides
the
senator
to
the
legislature.
and
it's
not
to
say
that
just
because
goshen
and
niobrara
would
be
combined
that
niobrara
county
would
not
in
fact
be
the
county
which
would
be
sending
its
representative
if
you
will...
a
county
representative,
the
local
member,
the
district
member,
representative
to
the
state
house.
in
wyoming
political
subdivisions
are
no
more
nor
no
lessening,
as
i've
already
stated,
than
the
majority
of
other
counties
found
in
the
united
states.
niobrara
county,
in
summary
has
judicial
remedies
available
should
it
be
found
that
it
is
a
victim
of
discrimination.
a
one
man-three
vote
principle
as
evidenced
in
this
case
is
certainly
unconstitutional.
might
the
court
have
any
questions?
thank
you,
very
much.
