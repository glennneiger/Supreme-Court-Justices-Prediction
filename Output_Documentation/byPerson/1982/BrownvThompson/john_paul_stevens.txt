justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
you
as
part
of
that
background
tell
us
who
your
clients
are
and
what
their
interest
is
in
winning
this
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question?
supposing
we
agreed
with
you
the
plan
as
it
was
presently
structured
was
unconstitutional,
and
we
suggested
that
the
appropriate
remedy
might
be
to
have
a
resident
of
niobrara
county
remain
in
the
legislature
but
be
elected
by
the
state
at
large.
would
that
cure
the
objection
for
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
take
care
of
the
voting
disparity.
it
would
take
care
of
the
disparity
in
voting
power
between
people
in
your
county
and
elsewhere.
in
fact,
the
people
in
niobrara
county
then
would
have
a
lesser
vote
than
anybody
else
in
the
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
you
have
no
interest
in
that
as
i
understand
it.
your
only
interest
is
in
the
weight
of
your
vote...
of
your
clients'
vote.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
supposing
all
of...
the
whole
legislature
was
elected
at
large,
but
they
provided
residence
requirements
just
exactly
as
they
have
now.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
and
everybody
then
had
an
equal
vote
for
every
legislator.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
agree
that
may
that
would
not
be
unconstitutional,
it
seems
to
me
you
must
also
agree
that
my
first
hypothetical
would
not
be
unconstitutional,
because
then
the
voting
power
as
for
the
people
who
voted
for
the
niobrara
legislator
would
be
equally
distributed
throughout
the
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
wouldn't
like
it,
i
understand.
you
would
want
that
county
to
be
represented.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
claim
must
be
founded
on
the
constitution
in
order
to
prevail
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
general
question?
does
the
record
tell
us
anything
about
the
political
makeup
of
the
legislature
of
niobrara
county.
what
political
party
is
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
what
is
the
majority
of
the
legislature?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
significant...
i
mean...
is
it
a
closely...
what
is
the
makeup
of
the
legislature
basically,
do
you
recall,
generally?
how
many...
how
big
is
the
republican
majority
of
the
legislature?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't,
there
is
no
claim
here
that
that
is
going
to
be
affected
by
the
outcome
of
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cox,
as
a
matter
of
history,
how
often
has
the
state
changed
its
county
boundaries?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any...
can
that
be
done
by
the
state
legislature
or
does
it
take
a
constitutional
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
example,
if
niobrara
and
the
adjoining
county
wanted
to
merge
and
become
one
county,
they
could
do
it
by
referendum
within
the
county,
approved
by
the
state
legislature,
or
something
like
that?
