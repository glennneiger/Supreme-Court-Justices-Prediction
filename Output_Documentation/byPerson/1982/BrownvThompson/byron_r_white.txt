justice
byron
r.
white
could
i...
could
i
ask
you,
did
you
attack
the
alternative--
justice
byron
r.
white
--no.
did
you
say
that
the
conference
committee
or
the
bill
says
if
this
provision
for
this
county
is
stricken,
then
it
would
be
combined
with
another
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
attack
that
part
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what's
the...
suppose
that
this
county
is
combined
with
the
next
county,
or
whichever
county
it's
to
be
combined
with.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
then
would
be
the
maximum
deviation
between
the
largest
county
and
the
smallest
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the...
the
largest
district
and
the
smallest
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
would
be
between
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well...
didn't
we
summarily
affirm
a
three-judge
court
back
in
the
'60's?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
deviation,
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think...
do
you
think...
that
affirmance
is...
or
that
three-judge
court
decision
is
consistent
with
our
later
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
89
percent
is
consistent
with
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
there
are
only
one
hundred
people
in
this
county?
you
would
be
arguing
the
same
thing,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
deviation
might
be
five
hundred
percent?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
there
were
five
counties
like
niobrara?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
really
suggesting
to
us
that
we
return
to
that...
give
more
weight
to
that
equation?
we
used
to
do
that,
a
way
back
in
the
'60s.
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
thing
any
of...
any
reapportionment
plan
in
any
state
should
be
acceptable
as
longs
as
majority
rule
is
not
threatened?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
any
rational
state
policy
should
justify
the
plan
as
long
as
minority
is
not
put
in
position
given
the
power
to
elect
a
majority
to
legislature?
