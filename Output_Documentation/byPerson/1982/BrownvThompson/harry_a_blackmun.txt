ms.
davidson,
did
you
attack
the
apportionment
scheme
as
a
whole,
or
just
as
it
applied
to
the
one
county?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
not
the
whole
plan?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
think
you've
weakened
your
case
by
this
tactic?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did...
why
are
you
so
concerned
about
the
grant
of
a
single
representative
to
this
one
county?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
don't
care
about
the
rest
of
the
state?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
your
state
does
the
league...
is
it
statewide
in
its
organization?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
i
come
back
to
my
question.
why
didn't
you
just
attack
the
whole
apportionment,
the
whole
state
apportionment
of
the
house?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
isn't
that
again
the
weakness
of
your
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
attacking
just
the
one
county?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
an
unfair
question,
but
in
the
light
of
decisions
from
this
court
in
the
past,
do
you
think
the
entire
apportionment
of
the
wyoming
house
is
constitutional?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
those
deviations
are
higher
than
any
that
have
been
upheld
here
before.
