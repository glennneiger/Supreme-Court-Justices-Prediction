justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
davidson,
is
this
material
which
you
are
speaking
of
now
in
the
record
somewhere,
or
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
clients
have
to
reach
a
sort
of
a
political
compromise,
i
suppose,
just
the
way
the
legislature
does.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is...
i
suppose
it's
almost
self-demonstrating
that
if
niobrara
county
is
to
have
one
member
of
the
legislature,
the
alternative...
an
alternative
plan
that
would
both
provide
for
a
minimal
deviation
and
that,
would
give
wyoming
a
two
or
three
hundred
member
house
of
representatives.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
davidson,
what
practical
harm
do
your
various
clients
in
the
more
populous
counties
of
wyoming
suffer
as
a
result
of
giving
niobrara
a
representative
rather
than
half
a
representative.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it's
statewide
it
really
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference
what
the
people
in
niobrara
county
do
or
their
one
out
of
64
representatives
do,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
anything
in
a
court
order
directing
the
wyoming
legislature
to
follow
the
63-member
plan
rather
the
64-member
plan
and
merge
niobrara
with
whatever
the
other
county
is.
that
wouldn't
get
laramie
county
back
the
two
representatives
that
you
say
it
has
lost?
