justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were...
were
any
of
these
cases
reviewed
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
was
a
summary
affirmance
in
that
instance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
though
there
was
a
provision
that
if
you
fail
here
the
arrangement
of
a
combination
with
goshen
county
would
become
effective.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
this
county
doesn't
lose
if
that
happens.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand,
though,
your
the
chief
justice
that
if
you
lose
there
has
to
be
legislative
action
before
the
situation
can
be
corrected.
is
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
gather...
whether
the
plan
is
workable
or
not,
if
you
lose
then
the
combination
with
goshen
becomes
a
effective,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
whether
or
not
the
legislature
does
something
further
will
be--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
really
be
a
departure
form
one
man,
one
vote,
wouldn't
it?
