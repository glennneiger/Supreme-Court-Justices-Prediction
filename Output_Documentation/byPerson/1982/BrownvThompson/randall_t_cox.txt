mr.
randall
t.
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
agree
with
the
appellant's
characterization
that
this
case
involves
the
apportionment
of
one
representative
to
one
representative
district
in
wyoming.
that
is,
to
the
citizens
and
taxpayers
of
niobrara
county.
all
other
representatives
were
apportioned
by
the
legislature
by
the
use
of
a
population
based
formula.
and
that
formula,
as
stated
in
the
pleadings
and
as
admitted
by
the
plaintiffs
today...
by
the
appellants
today...
comports
with
applicable
law.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
the
reason
that
i
think
it's
unconstitutional...
that
it
is
constitutional
relates
to
our
theory
of
the
case
as
we
have
talked
about
niobrara
county
in
particular.
and
that
is,
that
even
though
there
are
substantial
statistical
deviations
using
the
relative
range
figure,
those
deviations
do
not
indicate
any
significant
erosion
of
any
person's
fundamental
rights
of
free
and
fair
participation.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
are
considerably
lower
than
those
reapportionment
plans
stricken
by
this
court
in
reynolds
v.
sims
and
its
companion
cases.
they
are
in
an
area
that
this
court
hasn't
really
had
an
opportunity
to
look
at
before,
and
this
case
is
somewhat
unique
in
that
respect.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
harrison--
mr.
randall
t.
cox
--the
deviation
was
either
89
or
90
percent.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
i'm
not
sure
what
you're
asking.
i
think
it
is
consistent
with
your
later
cases.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
yes,
your
honor.
the
reason
that
i
contend
that
is
because
this
court
has
looked
at
that
percentage
deviation
figure
as
an
indicator,
and
a
very
important
indicator,
which
shows
just
how
close
a
state
is
coming
to
numerical
equality
in
its
apportionment
decisions.
but
the
court
has
not
invested
that
statistic
with
any
particular
significance,
except
in
saying
that
if
a
plan
deviates
by
less
than
then
percent
it
is
presumptively
valid
and
there
can't
be
threat.
the
reason
there
can't
be
a
threat
to
majority
control,
if
you
have
got
less
than
ten
percent
is
it's
statistically
highly
improbable
to
have
a
minority
dominating
the
legislature,
if
you've
got
less
than
ten
percent
deviation.
if
you
have
more
than
ten
percent
deviation,
i
suggest
that
we
use
the
other
standards
that
this
court
has
used
in
the
past,
and
look
at
other
statistical
measures
to
see
whether
that
indicator
that
says
there's
deviation
between
districts
indicates
some
kind
of
fundamental
impact,
invidious
impact
upon
the
exercise
fundamental
right.
this
court
talked
in
reynolds
v.
sims
and
its
companion
cases,
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
means
that
the
majority
has
to
control
the
legislature.
that
if
a
small
minority
such
as
25
percent
in
alabama
or
18
percent
in
maryland
has
a
strangle
hold
on
the
legislature
then
other
persons,
the
substantive
rights
of
the
majority
are
threatened.
in
this
case,
substantive
rights
of
majority
in
wyoming
or
the
plaintiff's
in
particular
or
the
counties
that
they
represent,
are
not
threatened
if
we
refer
to
those
other
statistical
measures.
the
reasons
for
that
are
that
the
number
of
representatives
in
the
wyoming
house
substantially
exceeds
the
number
of
representative
districts,
a
measure
emphasized
by
this
court
in
reynolds
v.
sims.
further,
the
legislature
is
responsive
to
the
majority
even
if
we
take,
deliberately,
a
sample
of
the
legislative
districts
in
the
state
and
take
those
that
are
most
overrepresented,
we
still
find
47
percent
of
the...
not
less
than
47
percent
can
elect
the
majority.
it
takes
at
least
47
percent
to
elect
the
majority
of
representatives.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
no,
justice
o'connor,
we
would
not
take
that
position.
clearly
reynolds
teaches
us
that
although
political
subdivisions
may
be
a
factor
that
deserve
consideration
in
apportionment,
carried
too
far
there
could
be
a
submergence
of
equal
participation.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
i
don't
think
that
that
statistic
alone
tells
us
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
several
of
these
statistics
because
each
just
measures,
and
sometimes
in
an
exaggerated
fashion,
a
particular
part
of
the
statistical
picture.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but,
fortunately,
we're
not
presented
with
that.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
if
we
looked
at
all
of
the
statistics
and
we
that
there
wasn't
a
threat
to
the
people
of
the
other
state,
i
would
be
comfortable
doing
that.
but,
when
you
start
getting
into
a
number
of
counties
that
are
far
away,
you
could
get
into
a
situation,
like
in
reynolds,
where
a
few
rural
counties
with
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
state's
population
were
dominating
the
legislature.
if
we
look
at
it
from
that
angle,
there
is
no
way
we
have
enough
rational
state
interest
here
to
justify
that--
mr.
randall
t.
cox
--i
wasn't
aware
that
the
court
had
departed
from
that.
i
find
frequent
references
to
that
standard,
and
it
really
seems
tome
that
the
approach
taken
in
reynolds
and
its
companions,
looking
at
all
those
measures
to
determine
whether
there
is
invidious
discrimination,
is
a
good
approach.
if
we
examine
the
effects
of
this
decision
to
give
one
representative
to
niobrara
county
upon
the
plaintiffs,
than
the
analysis
comes
down
to
what
happens
to
the
plaintiffs
if
we
have
that
extra
representative
or
if
we
don't.
if
we
look
at
those
statistics
we
see
that
46
percent
of
the
population
of
wyoming
resides
in
the
seven
counties
represented
by
the
plaintiffs,
the
appellants.
the
elect
28
of
64
representatives.
if
niobrara
county's
legislator
were
withdrawn,
they
would
elect
28
of
63.
if
we
look
at
a
percentage
to
see
which...
how
much
percentage
of
control
each
of
those
counties
has
in
the
legislature,
they
would
each
gain.03
or.07
of
a
percent
of
increased
power,
if
you
will,
in
the
wyoming
legislature
if
niobrara
county's
representative
were
withdrawn.
the
district--
mr.
randall
t.
cox
--if--
mr.
randall
t.
cox
--there's
no
question
that
the
plaintiffs
have
to
raise
this
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
to
an
imbecile
serving
in
the
legislature,
your
honor?
mr.
randall
t.
cox
yes,
i
think
they
would
have
a
right
to
object
to
that.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
they
have
a
right
to
object.
their
burden
is
to
show
that
there
is
an
injury
to
a
substantial--
mr.
randall
t.
cox
--it
is
an
injury
in
a
theoretical
sense
as
the
district
court--
mr.
randall
t.
cox
--yes.
well,
we
can
measure
the
injuries
statistically,
your
honor.
and
if
we
do
measure--
mr.
randall
t.
cox
--what
we're
suggesting
to
the
court
is
we
look
at
the
nature
and
the
degree
of
injury
here.
and
if
we
look
at
the
nature
of
the
injury--
mr.
randall
t.
cox
--there
is
deviation
from
strict
population
equality.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
i
can't
find
the
injury
in
the
statistically
significant
sense,
your
honor.
the
district
court
looked
at
these
figures.
and
they
focused
on
the
substantive
rights
of
the
plaintiffs,
their
counties,
and
other
voters
in
wyoming.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
that
was
cited
in
the
opinion,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
well,
in...
the
district
court
was
correct
in
that
this,
if
we
take
our
worse
possible
jaundice
view
of
this
represent...
of
this
apportionment
plan,
it
contains
nothing
more
dilutive
of
votes
than
anything
previously
reviewed
by
the
court...
by
the
district
court.
i
don't
know
that
we
particularly
have
to
stand
on
that
if
we
take
a
fresh
look
at
the
nature
of
the
injury
that's
alleged
here--
mr.
randall
t.
cox
--yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
opinion
also
talks
about
the
nature
and
degree
of
the
alleged
injury
and
the
arguments
put
forth
by
the
state
to
justify
the
deviation
from
strict
population
equality.
we
certainly
can't
deny
the
existence
of
those
statistics.
and
the
reasons
for
this
disctricting
decision
i
believe
are
more
important
in
wyoming
than
in
virginia
or
any
other
state
whose
apportionment
plans
have
been
reviewed
to
date.
local
governmentst
in
wyoming,
like
local
governments
in
most
states
particularly
counties
and
school
districts
are
charged
with
important
public
duties
and
provide
essential
public
services
and
construction
of
public
works
and
so
forth.
what
distiguishes
wyoming
from
most
states
is
there
are
explicit
and
strict
constituional
limits
on
the
abilities
of
counties
to
raise
money
whether
taxing
or
borrowing.
in
comparing
those
limits
to
other
states
such
as
delaware,
maryland
even
our
neighboring
states
montana
and
colorado,
we
see
that
counties
in
other
states
have
significantly
greater
ability
to
rasie
revenue.
in
addition
in
wyoming
we
do
not
have
provisions
for
county
self
rule.
in
order
for
a
county
to
obtain
the
necessary
powers
to
deal
with
new
growing
situations
and
new
needs
such
as
we
see
in
the
mineral
boom
areas
of
wyoming,
they
need
help
from
the
legislature.
if
we
look
at
every
local
government
in
wyoming
we
see
that
they
are
unable
to
raise
sufficient
revenues
to
provide
an
acceptable
level
of
public
services.
accordingly,
the
legislature
has
enacted
a
number
of
supplemental
revenue
schemes
to
provide
monies
on
a
variety
of
criteria,
not
all
of
which
are
consistent,
to
help
local
governments,
like
counties
and
school
districts,
supply
essential
public
services.
those
political
decisions
to
figure
out
what
criteria
should
be
used
in
revenue
distribution,
to
determine
which
new
taxes
should
be
imposed,
or
in
the
case
of
school
funding,
to
determine
whether
a
greater
share
of
local
tax
resources
should
be
taken
by
the
state
and
redistributed
under
new
criteria,
those
decisions,
of
course,
affect
the
very
lifeblood
of
local
government
in
wyoming.
and
those
decisions,
of
course,
are
made
in
the
legislature.
quite
simply,
local
government
in
wyoming
is
dependent
on
the
legislature.
there's
a
certain
vulnerability
of
counties
like
niobrara
that
is
set
forth
in
the
record,
that
because
of
political
decisions
made
in
the
state
legislature,
niobrara
county
is
contributing
substantially
more
revenues
in
the
forms
of
excise
taxes
and
school
foundations
monies
to
the
state,
which
is
then
distributed
to
other
local
governments
throughout
the
state,
than
that
county
is
getting
back
through
those
same
distribution
programs.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
that
is
somewhat
speculative,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
the
two
counties
would
be
combined.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
yes.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
if
loses
effective
representation,
your
honor.
goshen
county
has
got
about
three
times
as
many
registered
voters
as
niobrara
county.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
it
would
share
a
representative
in
a
theoretical
sense.
it
would
have
very
little
effect
upon
that
representative's
actions
as
a
political
matter.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
unfortunately,
that's
true.
if
we
examine...
and
this
is
in
the
record...
of
we
examine
the
interests
of
those
two
counties
in
a
number
of
state
revenue
programs,
we
see
that
the
two
counties
are
diametrically
opposed.
for
instance,
niobrara
county
taxpayers
provide
a
good
deal
of
oil
and
gas
severance
tax
to
the
state,
a
lot
more
than
they
get
back,
whereas
goshen
county
is
exactly
the
opposite.
very
little
of
that
money
goes
to
the
state
and
they
draw
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
of
that
money
every
year.
the
same
analysis
in
greater
numerical
terms
applies
to
school
funding.
niobrara
county
contributes
a
substantial
amount...
by
county
i'm
referring,
of
course,
to
the
taxpayers
and
to
taxes
collected
by
the
county.
that
money
goes
to
the
state
in
a
much
greater
proportion.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
no
school
funding
supplements
received
by
niobrara
county,
whereas
goshen
county
receives
on
of
the
largest
distributions
of
revenue
from
the
foundation
program,
of
any
county.
and,
in
addition,
goshen
county
has
gone
to
the
legislature
and
gotten
specific
local
apportionments
to
help
them
maintain
their
education
system.
to
expect
a
representative
to
balance
those
competing
considerations
in
a
joint
district
like
that
is
to
really
expect
the
impossible.
a
representative
is
going
to
have
to
make
a
choice
as
to
how
these
revenue
distribution
and
spending
provisions
work
and
he's
going
to
have
to
favor
the
more
populist
county
unless
he
wants
to
be
a
one-term
legislator.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
i
think
i
might
have
misunderstood
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
up
to
the
legislature,
that's
correct.
if
this
court
disapproves
the
apportionment
of
a
representative
to
the
citizens
of
niobrara
county,
then
the
combination
plan
goes
into
effect
automatically.
what
reynolds
v.
sims
tells
us
about
this
case
is
that
the
interest
of
political
subdivisions
can
be
considered
by
the
legislature
so
long
as
those
interests
are
related
to
a
rational
legitimate
state
purpose,
and
so
long
as
the
legislature
does
not
go
too
far.
we
submit
to
you
that
in
providing
niobrara
county
with
a
much
needed
representative
the
legislature
of
wyoming
has
not
gone
too
far.
there
is
ample
evidence
of
legitimate
state
interests
to
justify
the
numerical
deviation.
if,
as
in
reynolds
and
its
companion
cases,
there
were
a
substantial
erosion
of
majority
control
so
that
a
minority
could
injure
other
rights
of
a
majority
of
state's
population,
that's
a
different
story.
i
think
in
a
situation
like
that
the
court
has
indicated
that
strict
scrutiny
is
called
for.
and
in
the
absence
of
a
demonstrable
injury
to
a
fundamental
interest
here,
the
free
and
fair
participation
in
a
generally
population-based
apportionment
plan
that
does
not
threaten
the
majoritarianism,
then
the
usual
standard
of
constitutional
analysis
should
apply,
and
that
is
to
examine
legitimate
state
interests
that
justify
the
decision.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
well,
of
course,
there
are
other
considerations
that
this
court
has
addressed
in
cases
like
city
of
mobile
v.
bolden
and
rogers
v.
herman
lodge,
but
absence
discrimination
against
the
suspect
class...
we're
not
looking
at
a
scheme
designed
to
deprive
or
submerge
a
minority--
mr.
randall
t.
cox
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
i
don't
think
so,
justice
brennan,
because
the
whole
purpose
of
one
man,
one
vote,
as
this
court
observed
in
connor
v.
finch,
is
preservation
of
majoritarianism.
and
as
you
creep
further
and
further
away
from
majoritarianism,
the
demonstrable
injury
of
people's
rights
becomes
readily
apparent.
we
don't
have
that
problem
here.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
depart
from
reynolds
v.
sims
one
bit
to
approve
this
apportionment
decision.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
there
have
been
isolated
examples
where
counties
have
split
off...
maybe
a
large
county
was
divided...
i
don't
know
what
much
about
the
history
of
that.
mr.
randall
t.
cox
i
believe
it
has
to
be...
the
voters
of
the
county
are
involved,
and
then
it
has
to
be
approved
by
the
legislature.
i
don't
believe
the
constitutional
amendment
is
required
because--
mr.
randall
t.
cox
--yes,
i
believe
that
could
be
done.
but,
in
fact,
the
citizens
of
niobrara
county
split
off
from
their
neighboring
counties
some
70
years
ago
for
reasons
that
are
colorfully
illustrated
in
the
