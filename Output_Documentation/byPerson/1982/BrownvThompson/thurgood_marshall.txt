justice

that
political
compromise
is
not
binding
on
us,
i
hope?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
is
it
here
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
we
decide,
this
will
apply
to
the
other
counties
or
just
one
county?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i'd
be
bound
by
the
pleadings
in
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
don't
understand
how
the
league
of
women
voters
or
any
other
private
organization
can
limit
this
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
should
have
said
tried
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
these
women
in
the
state
that...
in
the
house
of
representative,
there
is
one
person
which
unconstitutionally
elected.
would
anybody
have
a
right
to
contest
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
only
one
vote
out
of
three
hundred.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
they
be
entitled
to
relief
from
an
unconstitutional
representative,
just
one?
suppose
it's
a...
it's
an
imbecile.
would
you
have
a
right
to
object
to
that
and
prevail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
don't
these
people
have
a
right
to
object,
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
an
injury
to
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
injury...
theoretical?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
get
around
a
vote
that's
an
illegal
vote.
it
hurts.
there's
no
degree
involved.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
do
admit
that
there
is
an
injury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
word
was
"injury".
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
large
portion
of
the
opinion
was
taken
up
with
the
fact
that
this
case
has
been
there
four
times
before.
that
was
a
large
part
of
the
opinion,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
all
that
we're
saying
is,
is
it
another
run
of
the
same
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
appeared
here
once
before.
