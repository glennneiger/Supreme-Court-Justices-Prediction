justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
get
any
guidance
from
the
cases
in
this
court
about
the
constitutionality
of
requiring
second
trimester
abortions
to
be
performed
in
a
hospital?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
one
of
them
was
what,
a
hospital
requirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose...
suppose
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
state
to
allege
it
in
the
indictment.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
require
that
the
defendant
in
such
case
plead
medical
necessity?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
virginia
supreme
court
hold
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
also
held
that
he
didn't,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
does
he
just
have
to
say,
i
invoke
the
defense?
is
that
all
he
has
to
do?
or
does
he
have
to
give
some
credible
basis
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
in
order
to
invoke
the
defense,
there
has
to
be
testimony
at
the
trial
supporting
the
defense
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
its
side
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
its
side
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
before...
how
does
the
state
know
what
defense
the
defendant
is
going
to
offer?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
is
all
the
raising
that
has
to
go
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
are
wrong
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
virginia
supreme
court
approached...
construed
the
statute
to
indicate
that
the
absence
of
medical
necessity
was
an
element
of
the
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
aren't
we...
must
we
not
accept
that
construction
of
the
virginia
statute,
and
then
the
question
is,
is
it
constitutional
as
so
construed?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
suppose,
though,
it
is
recognized
that
medical
necessity
is
a
defense,
it
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime,
but
it
is
a
defense,
which...
the
virginia
supreme
court
seemed
to
recognize
it
as
a
defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
is
it
constitutional
to
treat
it
as
a
defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
it
is
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
i
know,
but
that
is
where
we
are
in
this
case,
isn't
it,
on
this
issue,
is
whether
or
not
treating
it
as
a
defense,
but
with...
and
requiring
the
defendant
to
come
forward
with
some
evidence
about
it,
is
constitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
this
statute
passed?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
has
it
been
amended
since,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
had
it
been
proposed
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
virginia
have
any
sort
of
legislative
history
behind
statutes?
are
there
committee
reports,
or
hearings
that
there
is
any
record
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
issues
the
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
an
administrative
law
procedure
in
virginia
for--
justice
byron
r.
white
--were
these
regulations
adopted
after
such
a
procedure?
they
must
have
been.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
record
kept
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
a
notice.
is
there
a
proposal
sent
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
know
whether
the
proceeding
generated
any
interest
in
the
community
and
that
there
were
responses?
was
there
public
hearing?
was
there
a
public
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
regulations.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
know
whether
there
was
a
record
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
what
the
factual
basis
for
the
regulation
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
statute
require
that
hospitals
be
licensed?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
require
that
every
second
trimester
abortion
be
performed
in
a
licensed
hospital?
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
i
should
ask
my
question
another
way.
then
i
will
leave
you
alone.
could
the
board
or
whoever
issues
licenses,
whoever
issued
these
regulations,
could...
did
they
have
the
authority
under
the
statute
to
permit
second
trimester
abortions
to
be
performed
in
a
facility
such
as
the
doctor
was
running
without
a
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
had
no
authority
whatsoever
to
exempt
him
from
the
licensing
requirement.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
defendant
put
in
any
evidence
going
to
the
justification
for
the
hospital
requirement?
any
expert
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't...
he
didn't
challenge
the
requirement
of
having
some
facility
that
measures
up
to
standards?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
have
had
a
license
if
he...
he
should
have
been
able
to
get
a
license
if
he
applied
for
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
laws
against
malpractice,
i
suppose.
or
they
might
well
lance
a
boil,
a
carbuncle,
to
dignify
it,
in
the
office.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
involved
in
the
assertion?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
isn't
necessarily
fatal
to
the
state's
case
on
its
side
of
the
case
if
it
puts
on
no
evidence
of
necessity.
justice
byron
r.
white
general,
let
me
ask,
suppose
there
is
compliance
by
an
out-patient
clinic
with
the
regulations
and
the
law,
and
they
get
a
license,
and
they
are
authorized
to
perform
a
second
trimester
abortion,
and...
do
they
keep
the
patient
there
until
the
abortion
is...
or
would
they
have
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
because
of
the
method
that
was
employed--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
there
was
an
interval.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
a
licensed
establishment
had
used
this
method
at
this
time?
would
they
have
released
her
until
the
abortion
was
complete?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
she
would
return.
she
would
have
been
released?
