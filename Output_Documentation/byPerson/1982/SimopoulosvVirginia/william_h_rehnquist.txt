justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
can
your
client
complain
about
that
aspect
of
the
statute
since
i
understand
he
was
involved
with
a
second
trimester
abortion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
outside
the
field
of
free
speech
and
so
forth,
haven't
we
adopted
the
position
in
that
kind
of
a
challenge
that
you
can
challenge
the
parts
of
the
statute
that
apply
to
your
conduct,
but
not
parts
of
the
statute
that
apply
to
other
people's
conduct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
broderick
versus
oklahoma
supports
your
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
merits,
do
you
think
it
supports
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
is
a
statutory
defense,
i
presume
that
the
trial
court
is
thought
to
have
considered
it,
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
would
have
considered
it,
if
it
thought
it
was
a
statutory
defense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
aren't
you
basically
just
asking
us
to
reweigh
evidence
that
has
been
already
addressed
by
two
other
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
we
take
the
basic
factual
issues
pretty
much
as
we
get
them
from
lower
courts,
and
unless
you
are
asking
us
to
simply
reweigh
facts,
or
reweigh
the
burden
of
proof
or
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
an
instruction
to
a
jury
in
a
jury...
in
a
case
tried
by
a
jury.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
that
is
why
i
was
asking,
are
you
asking
us
to
reweigh
the
evidence
in
the
case
under
a
kind
of
a
jackson
versus
virginia
theory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
cite
jackson
against
virginia
in
your
brief?
