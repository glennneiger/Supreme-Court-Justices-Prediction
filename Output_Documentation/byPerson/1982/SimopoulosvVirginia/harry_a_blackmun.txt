but
without
limitation
as
to
trimester?
i
want
to
get
that
down
very,
very
securely.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
making
that
representation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
make
that
as
a
flat
statement
now.
there
is
disagreement,
is
there
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
as
i
read
the
briefs,
there
certainly
is
disagreement
on
that
proposition.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
there
are
all
kinds
of
surgical
procedures--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--minor
and
major,
and
would
it
be
violative
of
virginia
law
in
any
respect
if
a
physician
lanced
a
carbuncle
on
the
back
of
a
patient's
neck
in
the
office?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
that
is
a
surgical
procedure.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
he
prescribe
the
peanut
butter
sandwiches?
it
sounded
as
though
that
is
what
you
said.

do
you
know
whether...
does
the
record
show
that
she
was
instructed
to
return?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
he
did
or
did
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
is
disturbing
that
she
delivered
in
a
motel.
