mr.
roy
lucas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
dates
back
three
years
and
one
day
ago,
when
a
team
of
falls
church
police
arrived
at
the
american
women's
clinic
in
that
city.
dr.
simopoulos,
a
gynecologist,
was
inside
with
his
staff
and
numerous
patients.
he
practices
there
as
well
as
in
a
woodbridge
office
and
at
four
hospitals
in
northern
virginia
where
he
has
staff
privileges
as
a
board
certified
obstetrician/gynecologist.
the
police
seized
the
clinic,
secured
it.
they
arrested
dr.
simopoulos,
searched
the
premises,
photographed
the
area,
including
the
operating
room,
the
laboratory,
and
the
various
pieces
of
equipment
that
he
had
there.
they
in
particular
had
a
search
warrant
and
seized
the
medical
records
of
one
young
woman
who
has
gone
by
initials
during
the
course
of
this
case,
and
i
will
continue
to
do
so.
they
also
seized
the
sign-in
sheet
that
had
the
names
of
all
of
the
patients
who
were
there
on
that
particular
day.
dr.
simopoulos
was--
mr.
roy
lucas
--these
are
basic
background
facts,
your
honor.
that
is
all.
i
was
getting
to
the
charge
now.
mr.
roy
lucas
they
are
just
background
about
the
fact
that
he
was
then
arrested,
he
was
then
charged
under
the
particular
virginia
statute,
the
virginia
code
18.2-71.
the
statute
defines
as
a
felony
any
abortion
"except
as
provided"
in
the
other
sections
that
are
within
the
particular
article.
the
statute
is
in
its
language
remarkably
like
the
statutes
from
1848,
the
first
statute
up
through
1970,
except
the
earlier
statutes
were
included
in
one
paragraph,
whereas...
and
this
was
significant
to
the
virginia
supreme
court...
the
current
statute
is
in
several
different
statutory
sections.
the
indictment,
which
is
set
out
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
pages
3
through
4,
charged
only
the
violation
of
the
one
statute,
the
71
statute,
which
on
its
face
declares
all
abortions
illegal
except
as
provided
in
the
other
statutory
sections.
the
indictment
did
negate
two
of
the
separate
sections,
the
section
pertaining
to
the
length
of
pregnancy
and
that
the
indictment
alleged,
and
it
was
not
contested,
that
pregnancy
was
in
the
second
trimester.
the
indictment
also
negated
the
question
of
whether
the
abortion
had
been
performed
in
a
hospital
or
somewhere
else.
the
indictment
did
not
negate,
however,
the
74-1
section
on
medical
necessity.
the
prosecution
theory,
as
expressed
in
the
indictment
and
in
the
various
arguments,
particularly
the
closing
argument
at
449
of
the
joint
appendix,
was
that
the
commonwealth
had
only
to
prove
some
act
by
the
doctor
with
intent
to
cause
an
abortion,
and
that
that
constituted
the
sufficiency
of
the
crime.
according
to
the
prosecution
theory,
the
crime
was
essentially
complete
when
p.m.
left
dr.
simopoulos's
american
women's
clinic,
provided
that
she
later
somewhere
aborted,
and
provided
that
the
prosecution
was
able
to
connect
up
the
saline
installation
procedure
with
either
the
demise
of
the
fetus
or
the
abortion
of
the
fetus.
there
was
a
bench
trial
in
this
case
rather
than
a
jury
trial,
at
which
numerous
arguments
were
made,
of
which
three
have
remained
in
our
presentation
to
the
court
here.
in
pretrial
hearings
that
lasted
about
a
day
and
a
half,
the
defendant
put
on
evidence
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
to
challenge
the
arguments
to
challenge
the
defects
in
the
indictment
and
the
definition
of
the
offense.
we
called
various
expert
witnesses
to
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
there
was
any
health
or
other
basis
for
the
statute.
we
had
three
gynecologists
from
northern
virginia
experienced
with
second
trimester
abortions,
as
well
as
one
particular
gynecologist
who
had
conducted
an
extensive
study
on
out-patient
saline
abortions.
mr.
roy
lucas
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
roy
lucas
your
honor,
the
clinic
does
not
have
a
license
as
an
out-patient
hospital.
we
submitted
in
our
reply
brief...
the
commonwealth
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
the
question
of
whether
the
out-patient
hospital
requirements
would
apply.
there
are
two
types
of
out-patient
hospital
licenses
in
the
state,
and--
mr.
roy
lucas
--it
was
not
licensed
under
the
laws
of
virginia.
dr.
simopoulos
sent
a
letter
inquiring
about
licensure
on
february
the
13th,
1980,
which
appears
as
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief.
mr.
roy
lucas
that's
correct.
mr.
roy
lucas
he
never
applied.
he
was
advised
in
the
response
from
the
commonwealth
that
his
office
could
not
become
licensed
as--
mr.
roy
lucas
--that's
correct.
i
presume
the
interpretation
would
have
been
the
same.
mr.
roy
lucas
i
would
think
that
the
interpretation
the
attorney
general
offered
in
denying
him
later
would
have
applied
earlier.
the
fact
of
the
prosecution--
mr.
roy
lucas
--he
could
have
theoretically--
mr.
roy
lucas
--he
could
have
applied
to
the
state
department
of
health,
the
same
people
that
license
hospitals
in
general.
the
attorney
general
told
him
he
had
to
build
a
hospital,
however.
mr.
roy
lucas
as
first...
there
are
some
out-patient
abortion
hospitals
in
the
commonwealth
that
are
licensed
to
do
first
trimesters.
it
is
very
unclear,
and
certainly--
mr.
roy
lucas
--that's
correct.
mr.
roy
lucas
he
did
not
attempt
to
apply
for
that,
and
the
state
has
never
required
him
to.
the
state
has
treated
him
as
a
physician's
office
where
first
trimester
abortions
might
definitely
be
performed
without
question
under
virginia
law.
the
state
has
never
taken
the
position
in
any
way
that
he
was
required
to--
mr.
roy
lucas
--the
record
is
quite
silent
on
that,
but
i
am
certain
there
are.
mr.
roy
lucas
there
is
no
evidence
that
a
facility
performing
second
trimester
abortions
could
even
obtain
certification.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
whatsoever
of
that.
the
analysis
of
the
different
out-patient
licensing
regulations
might
even
suggest
that
they
are
not
applicable.
the
virginia
supreme
court
at
one
point
in
its
opinion
interpreted
the
abortion
law
to
require
abortions
at
every
stage
to
be
inside
the
hospital.
that
would
seem
to
exclude
any
out-patient
facility,
because
the
out-patient
facility
by
definition
sends
the
patients
home
at
the
end
of
the
surgical
procedure
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
roy
lucas
they
are
indeed,
but
they
are
prescribed
as
hospitals
that
are
for
day
type
surgery,
where
the
patients
do
not
stay
overnight,
and--
mr.
roy
lucas
--i
don't
believe
i
understood
your
question.
i
think--
mr.
roy
lucas
--there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
or
any
of
the
health
department
reports
or
anything
to
support
that.
i
have
no
knowledge
or
basis
in
the
record
to
think
that
a
second
trimester
abortion
has
ever
been
performed
in
an
out-patient
surgical
hospital,
and
that
is
something
that
was
never
even
mentioned
until
this
level.
the
virginia
supreme
court
had
no
opportunity
to
interpret
it,
to
even
determine
whether
the
out-patient
surgical
hospital
question...
i
would
anticipate
that
if
we
ever
had
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
that
issue
raised
at
this
point
by
the
virginia
attorney
general,
that
we
would
be
able
to
show
that
there
are
very
few
facilities
licensed
as
out-patient
surgical
hospitals.
we
would
show
that
according
to
the
attorney
general,
they
would
not
let
dr.
simopoulos
obtain
the
type
of
license
for
second
trimester
abortions
he
had
requested,
because
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
the
letter
in
the
reply
brief
told
him
he
would
have
to
build
a
hospital.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
as
far
as
this
record
shows,
the
only
places
where
second
trimester
abortions
are
done,
certainly
in
northern
virginia,
are
in
the
two
hospitals,
the
fairfax
hospital
and
the
alexandria
hospital.
that
is
out
of
well
over
20
hospitals
in
the
northern
virginia
area.
there
are
95
in
the
state.
which
shows
the
sharp
restrictive
impact,
certainly,
of
the
statute.
and
the--
mr.
roy
lucas
--that
is
correct.
he
was
never
required
to
apply
for
one.
i
would
presume
that
applies
to
non-physician
owned
type
facilities.
this
was
a
physician's
office
that
happened
to
be
extremely
well
equipped.
the
commonwealth
never
required
him
to
apply
for
it,
and
since
it
would
be
a
misdemeanor
for
him
not
to
if
it
was
required,
presumably
he
was
operating
a
perfectly
lawful
place.
the
evidence
certainly
in
the
record
about
dr.
simopoulos's
clinic
would
show
that
he
had
all
of
the
facilities
that
would
have
met
the
requirements
of
the
first
trimester
abortion
clinic
if
there
had
been
any
reason
for
him
to
apply
for
it.
certainly
the
testimony
of
the
expert
witnesses,
i
believe
three
of
them
actually
went
and
viewed
his
clinic
before
they
testified
in
order
to
be
able
to
compare
the
type
of
facility
that
he
had
with
the
type
of
facility
that
they
utilized
at
the
fairfax
hospital,
and
each
of
them
testified
that
he
had
far
more
extensive
equipment.
he
had
the
highest
qualifications
one
could
have,
not
only
the
training
in
gyn
but
the
training
in
emergency
medicine
that
he
had,
and
he
had
the
extra
equipment
that
would
be
necessary
that
he
preferred
to
have,
equipment
which
was
not
at
all
present
in
the
hospital
context.
the
requirement
that
abortions
be
done
within
the
hospital
stops
at
that
point,
and
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows,
the
hospital
simply
used
a
standard
treatment
room
with
no
special
equipment
in
it
whatsoever.
one
of
the
documents
submitted
by
the
commonwealth
in
their
submissions,
in
the
virginia
addendum
at
page
80,
is
the
american
college
of
ob/gyn
technical
bulletin
from
1976,
which
points
out
that
saline
installation
abortions
can
safely
be
done
in
a
standard
treatment
room,
and
i
would
submit
that
shows
to
us
that
the
facility
that
he
had
was
far...
in
far
better
condition.
it
also
points
out
the
low
mortality
rate
from
the
saline
installation
procedure,
and
that
it
could
even
be
cut
in
half
using
the
various
advanced
techniques
which
there
was
testimony
that
dr.
simopoulos
was
utilizing.
and
that
goes
strongly
in
favor
of
cutting
against
any
health
interests
which
the
state
has
offered,
and
the
state
has
only
made
that
contention
pertaining
to
the
health
interest.
the
commonwealth
at
the
pretrial
hearing
submitted
no
evidence
whatsoever.
they
did
not
call
a
single
expert
witness
in
support
of
what
burden
they
would
have
to
show
a
health
interest
of
the
state.
they
didn't
call
anyone.
they
didn't
call
any
witness
of
any
kind.
and
they
simply
did
not
make
any
attempt,
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
ruled
what
i
believe
is
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
review
under
the
decisions
from
this
court
that
the
burden
entirely
of
showing
the
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
was
on
the
defendant,
on
the
physician.
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
certainly
indicated
that,
from
roe
v.
wade
onward,
that
the
commonwealth
would
have
some
burden
of
showing
a
maternal
health
interest,
showing
a
compelling
interest,
showing
that
their
regulations
were
narrowly
tailored,
that
they
were
reasonably
related
to
maternal
health,
and
the
commonwealth
in
this
case
made
no
attempt
whatsoever
to
meet
that
burden.
mr.
roy
lucas
there
have
been
mentions
from
time
to
time
in
the
court's
opinion
from
roe
and
onward.
most
of
the
mentions
i
have
seen
in
the
opinions
have
indicated
in
the
second
trimester
regulations
reasonably
related
to
maternal
health
may
be
valid.
roe
used
that
terminology.
roe
indicated
there
were
various
types
of
reasonably
related
health
regulations
which
the
state
might
attempt
to
apply.
mr.
roy
lucas
roe
did
refer
to
the
possibility
of
a
hospital
requirement.
roe
did
not
squarely
indicate
that
the
hospital
requirement
would
be
considered
valid.
at
the
time,
as
pointed
out
in
the
american
medical
association
brief,
there
was
very
little
evidence
about
the
safety
of
second
trimester
hospital
procedures.
abortion
had
been
illegal
in
this
country.
there
was
no
record,
no
evidence
in
that
case.
and
the
issue
was
certainly
never
addressed
by
anyone,
and
it
was
considered
to
be,
i
would
think,
a
guideline
from
the
court
as
one
of
the
possible
types
of
regulations,
as
opposed
to
a
definitive
holding,
since
the
second
trimester
hospital
requirement
was
not
at
issue.
subsequently,
in
the
danforth
case
and
the
colautti
case,
this
court
has
certainly
carefully
scrutinized
the
basis
of
restrictions
and
prohibitions
in
the
second
trimester
abortion
area.
in
the
danforth
case,
where
the
court
had
the
question
of
an
attempt
by
the
state
of
missouri
to
outlaw
saline
abortions,
the
court
carefully
examined
the
basis
for
that
attempted
prohibition,
and
pointed
out
on
the
evidence
in
that
case,
as
later
in
colautti,
that
the
saline
installation
technique
was
one
of
the
primary
techniques,
if
not
the
primary
technique
for
that
15
percent
or
so
of
patients
who
find
themselves
in
the
second
trimester,
and
that
danforth
specifically
pointed
out
that
on
that
record
at
that
time,
the
saline
installation
procedure
had
a
lower
mortality
rate
than
that
of
childbirth,
which
was
one
of
the
important
factors
considered
in
the
danforth
case.
now,
that
was
on
a
1974
record.
there
have
been
eight
years
of
medical
technology
developments
since
that
time,
which
would
only
enhance
the
position
of
the
defendant
in
challenging
the
absence
of
any
maternal
health
basis
for
the
statute
at
present.
we
argued
in
our
first
primary
point
with
one
of
the
criminal
procedure
questions,
since
the
underlying
statute
need
not
be
reached
if
the
point
one
or
point
two
is
persuasive
to
the
court.
the
statute
under
which
the
doctor
was
charged
criminalizes
all
abortions
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
it
would
allow
the
indictment
of
any
physician
for
performing
any
abortion.
the
physician
would
then
at
least
have
to
evoke
and
perhaps
come
forward
with
more
in
the
way
of
proof
that
the
abortion
was
justified
under
that
particular
subsequent
statute.
this
approach
to
the
case,
the
virginia
supreme
court
did
to
avoid
the
other
problems
of
united
states
v.
vuitch.
the
united
states
v.
vuitch
statute
is
so
similar
to
the
virginia
statute
in
many
ways,
except
it
is
all
incorporated
into
one
paragraph.
the
virginia
supreme
court
construed
its
statute
as
being
different
statutory
sections,
and
therefore
reaching
a
different
result.
as
it
was
construed,
however,
the
virginia
supreme
court
then
ran
immediately
into
questions
that
did
not
deal
with
the
question
of
are
you
violating
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
physician
and
a
patient
when
you
allow
a
physician
to
be
indicted
under
a
statute
simply
for
performing
an
abortion.
if
it
is
a
first
trimester
abortion,
it
falls
right
in
the
language
of
that--
mr.
roy
lucas
--well,
he
is
primarily
complaining
about
the
second
trimester.
i
am
just
illustrating
how
the
statute
is
construed.
the
statute
as
construed
would
outlaw
all
second
trimester
abortions
also.
mr.
roy
lucas
we
cited
cases
in
our
reply
brief,
such
as
eisenstadt
v.
baird,
broderick
v.
oklahoma,
which
have
applied
the
standing
concept
in
a
broader
way
when
the
right
of
privacy
is
concerned,
and
the
court
has
certainly--
mr.
roy
lucas
--on
the
standing
question,
yes.
mr.
roy
lucas
and
on
the
merits,
it
is
a
first
amendment
case,
so
i
don't
think
it
would
be
applicable.
we
didn't
examine
it
on
the
merits,
but
it
does
rely
on
eisenstadt
v.
baird,
which
was
a
criminal
prosecution
under
the
anti-contraceptive
law,
in
which
the
court
gave
broad
standing
to
mr.
baird
to
raise
and
assert
the
rights,
and
here
you've
got
a
situation
of
physicians
treating
patients
at
all
kinds
of
different
stages
of
pregnancy.
in
this
particular
situation,
you've
got...
you'll
have
physicians
treating
patients
at
13
weeks,
15
weeks,
17
weeks,
19
weeks,
treating
patients
by
three
or
four
different
types
of
second
trimester
procedures,
and
the
concepts
of
standing
the
court
has
enunciated
would
certainly
support
the
view
that
the
physician
should
have
standing
to
raise
the
interests
of
his
entire
range
of
second
trimester
practice
and
the
entire
range
of
patients,
that
he
should
not
be
confined
to
22.0
weeks,
and
then
there
be
another
case
in
this
court
three
years
later
on
23.0
weeks
or
19.0
weeks.
we
have
attempted
to
deal
with
that
extensively
in
our
brief.
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions
in
singleton
v.
wulff
discuss
standing
questions
involving
access
to
abortion
in
a
way
which
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
and
we
believe
is
strongly
supportive
of
allowing
the
doctor
full
standing
to
challenge
the
statute
in
its
full
scope.
the
trial
court
did
not
make
any
findings
whatsoever
or
address
the
question
of
this
burden
of
production
in
the
medical
necessity
question,
and
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
cases
such
as
sandstrom
and
patterson
v.
new
york
would
apply
in
a
way
which
is
helpful
to
the
defendant
in
that
when
one
looks
at
the
facts
of
what
actually
happened
in
this
case
in
the
transcript,
it
is
crystal
clear
that
the
prosecution
made
no
attempt
to
disprove
medical
necessity.
it
is
crystal
clear
that
the
trial
court
never
made
any
instruction
to
itself
or
to
discuss
with
counsel
or...
in
any
way
as
to
where
that
burden
would
lie.
the
trial
court
completely
disregarded
the
medical
necessity
question.
it
is
clear
that
under
those
circumstances,
in
a
case
such
as
sandstrom
and
the
other
cases
we
have
cited,
that
medical
necessity
would
be
not
only
a
statutory
defense,
it
would
be
a
constitutional
defense,
and
that
if
medical
necessity--
mr.
roy
lucas
--well,
the
trial--
mr.
roy
lucas
--not
at
all.
there
is
no
indication
that
the
trial
court...
the
trial
court
did
anything
other
than
put
the
full
burden
of
persuasion
on
the
physician
on
medical
necessity.
mr.
roy
lucas
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
said
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
was
on
the
prosecution,
but
that
is
simply
not
what
happened
at
the
trial.
mr.
roy
lucas
in
the
cases
such
as
sandstrom,
the
court
has
looked
at
the
transcript
to
see
what
happened,
and
the
virginia
supreme
court--
mr.
roy
lucas
--well,
jackson
v.
virginia
indicates
that
in
a
bench
trial
the
same
standards
would
apply,
that
you
would...
that
the
trial
judge
in
a
bench
trial
is
presumed
to
instruct
himself
or
herself.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
certainly
part
of
our
argument.
under
jackson--
mr.
roy
lucas
--extensively,
yes,
and
we
cited
sandstrom
also,
and
patterson
also,
and
we
attempted
to
show
that
in
this
case,
that
because
the
burden
of
production
on
that
question
involves
a
constitutional
defense,
that
in
that
limited
area,
which
would
apply
in
this
case,
in
that
limited
area,
that
the
burden
of
production
and
persuasion
should
be
entirely
on
the
commonwealth.
otherwise,
the
commonwealth
can
come
in
and
indict
people
for
constitutionally
protected
conduct
in
this
area,
in
the
first
amendment
area,
or
any
other
area,
and
that
that
is
one
of
the
biggest
problems
with
the
criminal
procedure
issues
in
the
case,
is
that
this
is
not
a
collateral
issue
like...
as
in
patterson,
the
emotional
disturbance
question.
this
is
something
very
central.
if
the
abortion
was
necessary
for
the
patient's
life
or
health,
then
the
abortion
was
constitutionally
protected,
and
the
commonwealth
would
have
the
obligation
to
allege
that
in
the
indictment
and
to
come
forward
with
proof
on
that
particular
question.
mr.
roy
lucas
then
the
state
would,
under
u.s.
v.
vuitch,
we
would
suggest
that
it
is,
but
if
the...
under
the
interpretation
that
the
commonwealth...
the
virginia
supreme
court
offered--
mr.
roy
lucas
--i
think
that
would
be
a
close
question,
since
it
is
constitutionally
protected
conduct.
mr.
roy
lucas
they
squarely
held
that
it
was
not
unconstitutional
to
require
him
to
invoke
the
question.
that
is
all
he
had
to
do--
mr.
roy
lucas
--no,
they
didn't.
they
addressed
the
question
pretty
thoroughly.
the
commonwealth
has
argued
that
he
did
not
invoke
it,
but
he
invoked
it
very
clearly
and
it
is
raised
in
the
joint
appendix,
194
through
197.
mr.
roy
lucas
there
is
no
procedure
under
the
virginia
criminal
procedure
for
invoking
a
particular
defense
of
this
nature.
there
is
for
insanity
and
alibi
and
things
of
that
nature,
but
there
is
no
special
procedure.
the
invocation
in
this
case
was
done
by
counsel's
argument
concerning
u.s.
v.
vuitch
and
the
argument
that
the
commonwealth
had
the
burden
of
proving
all
of
the
elements
of
the
crime,
and
that
appears
at
194
through
197
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
would
occur
in
the
case
of
the
defendant's
case.
and
we
contended
at
the
motion
to
strike,
at
the
pages
that
i
cited,
that
the
commonwealth
had
the
obligation
of
putting
on
some
of
the
evidence
to
refute
that
constitutional
defense.
mr.
roy
lucas
pardon
me?
mr.
roy
lucas
yes.
by
all
means.
that
the
commonwealth
would
have
to
prove
that
the
conduct
was
not
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
roy
lucas
the
arguments
based
on
u.s.
v.
vuitch,
i
think,
clearly
alerted
the
commonwealth
to
the
medical
necessity
question.
we
made
no
attempt
to
hide
the
question.
we
raised
u.s.
v.
vuitch.
that
is
all
about
medical
necessity,
and--
mr.
roy
lucas
--i
would
think
so,
yes.
if
the
commonwealth
didn't
understand
at
that
point,
then
i
would
think
we
have
no
role,
we
can't
call
witnesses
during
the
commonwealth's
case.
mr.
roy
lucas
i
believe
we
have
taken
that
position
throughout.
mr.
roy
lucas
oh,
yes,
i
am.
mr.
roy
lucas
the
latter.
mr.
roy
lucas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
lucas
then
there
are
other
approaches
to
it.
if
the
burden
is
then
on
the...
it
depends
on
the
question
then
of
burden
of
production.
is
the
burden
of
production
entirely
on
the
defendant?
in
this
particular
case,
we
would
contend
that
when
you
get
to
cases
such
as
sandstrom--
mr.
roy
lucas
--no,
they
did
not.
they
construed
the
statute
so
that
there
was
only
one
element
of
a
crime,
namely,
an
abortion
being
done,
that
everything
else
was
something
that
had
to
be
invoked
by
the
defendant.
mr.
roy
lucas
yes,
accepting
that
construction
of
the
virginia
statute
then
takes
you
immediately
into
the
roe
v.
wade
question
of
whether
they
can
indict
people
for
every
abortion
in
the
commonwealth,
and
that
is
the
central
thrust
of
our
first
argument.
mr.
roy
lucas
they
treated
it
as
a
defense,
yes.
mr.
roy
lucas
i
would
think
not.
mr.
roy
lucas
we
have
argued
strenuously
that
it
is
not.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
certainly
where
we
are,
yes.
mr.
roy
lucas
well,
this
court
i
don't
believe
has
decided
that,
but
addressed
it
in
the--
mr.
roy
lucas
--not
in
this
court,
sir.
there
is
a
split
of
circuits,
i
think,
on
the
question.
the
court
talked
about
that
in
engle
v.
isaac.
mr.
roy
lucas
representing
a
defendant,
i
would
argue
that
the
government
does
have
that
obligation.
mr.
roy
lucas
only
the
decisions
at
a
lower
level
than
this
court,
and
the
discussion
that
that
is
at
least
a
substantial--
mr.
roy
lucas
--in
virginia,
virginia
goes
the
other
way.
virginia
squarely
went
the
other
way.
i
will
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
roy
lucas
if
i
may
further
reply
to
justice
blackmun's
question
concerning
whether
she
was
told
to
return
or
not,
under
the
virginia
supreme
court
interpretation
of
the
statute,
that
might
not
make
any
difference,
but
on
page
187
of
the
joint
appendix,
she
squarely
admits
that
the
doctor
told
her
to
go
to
the
hospital
if
she
had
severe
cramps.
she
never
threw
away
the
instruction
sheets,
which
were
clear,
and
his
two
phone
numbers
24-hour-a-day
were
circled
in
there.
this
question
about
ambulatory
surgical
centers
is
extremely
important,
i
think,
to
this
particular
case,
and
it
is
unfortunate
there
was
no
opportunity
to
respond
to
it
in
the
lower
courts
or
in
the
trial
or
to
put
on
a
full
exposition
of
it.
looking
at
the
regulations,
the
part
3
regulations
on
out-patient
hospitals
actually
require
more
extensive
extra
technology
than
do
the
part
2
on
out-patient
surgical
hospitals.
in
construing
those
regulations
and
reading
them
as
to
what
do
they
contemplate,
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
that
the
out-patient
surgical
hospital
scheme
contemplates
second
trimester
abortions.
there
is
no
evidence
that
a
second
trimester
abortion
has
ever
been
done
in
an
out-patient
surgical
hospital.
the
commonwealth
named
four
facilities.
the
virginia
heart
institute
certainly
does
no
second
trimester
abortions.
the
hampton
general
out-patient
emergency
center
certainly
does
none.
the
fairfax
surgery
center
is
in
the
community
involved
here,
and
was
never
named
by
any
witness
as
permitting
second
trimester
abortions.
and
there
is
another
one
in
norfolk,
virginia,
that
i
know
nothing
about,
except
it
is
not
in
the
list
of
second
trimester
abortions
offered
by
the
commonwealth
in
its
exhibits.
they
list
no
out-patient
surgical
facility
that
ever
performed
a
second
trimester
abortion.
thank
you.
