mr.
william
g.
broaddus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
virginia
respectfully
submits
that
this
court
may,
and
indeed
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
based
upon
the
law
and
the
facts
of
this
case.
only
by
substantially
enlarging
the
roe
v.
wade
right
and
restricting
the
state's
legitimate
interest
may
the
court
have
a
basis
for
reaching
a
contrary
result.
because
the
virginia
statute
under
attack
in
this
case
is
drawn
directly
from
the
description
in
roe
of
legitimate
and
permissible
state
regulation,
we
respectfully
urge
affirmance.
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
indicated,
there
are
some
difficulties
with
respect
to
standing
in
this
matter,
and
we
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
focus
only
on
those
factual
situations
in
which
dr.
simopoulos
has
a
personal
interest
at
stake,
and
not
to
permit
him
to
assert
hypothetical
bases
for
invalidating
or
alleging
the
invalidity
of
virginia
statutes.
i
believe
that
that
is
certainly
consistent
with
this
court's
opinions
in
harris
v.
mcpae
and
in
the
general
line
of
cases.
eisenstadt
v.
baird
would,
we
believe,
not
be
on
point
in
this
particular
situation,
because
that
case
involved
a
situation
in
which
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
trial
was
permitted
to
assert
the
rights
of
distributees
of
contraceptives.
those
persons
who
were
receiving
the
product
were
not
subject
to
criminal
prosecution,
and
would
not
have
a
forum
to
assert
their
rights.
so,
that
took
that
particular
situation
out
of
the
general
standing
proposition.
turning
to
the
major
issue
in
this
case,
virginia
law
imposes
with
respect
to
second
trimester
abortions
only
three
conditions:
first,
that
it
be
performed
after
the
patient
has
given
her
informed
written
consent;
second,
that
it
be
performed
by
a
physician;
and
third,
that
it
be
performed
in
a
hospital.
clearly,
this
scheme
is
not--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
we
factually
do
not
know
whether
dr.
simopoulos's
clinic
could
have
been
so
licensed.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
ma'am,
they
certainly
have.
there
are
four,
in
the
most
recent
compilation
that
i
am
aware
of,
in
which
out-patient
surgical
hospitals
have
been
licensed
by
the
commonwealth
to
perform
surgical
procedures
in
accordance
with--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--mr.
justice
brennan,
that
is
set
forth
in
the
commonwealth's
addendum.
it
involves
filing
an
application
which
satisfies
the
requirements
in
that...
that
are
specified
by
the
state
board
of
health.
among
other
things,
there
has
to
be
certain
equipment
present
within
the
facility.
the
doctor
has
to
in
writing
define
certain
procedures
which
he
will
follow
when
he
performs
surgical
operations.
there
have
to
be
certain
arrangements
for
transporting
the
patient
to
a
general
acute
care
hospital
in
the
event
of
complications
which
cannot
be
handled
there
in
the
hospital.
there
have
to
be
certain
arrangements
for
anesthesiologists,
certain
arrangements
for
infection
control,
and
things
of
this
nature.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
to
the
state
board
of
health,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
certainly,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
now,
with
respect
to
the
letter,
as
you
observed,
that
letter
was
written
after
the
facts,
but
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
it
was
written
in
response
to
an
inquiry
about
a
certificate
of
need,
which
is
an
entirely
different
procedure
from
certification
as
an
out-patient
hospital,
and
also
it
was
based
upon
the
assumption,
stated
in
that
letter,
that
dr.
simopoulos
was
simply
operating
a
doctor's
office,
not
a
general
surgical
facility.
now,
six
weeks
after
that
letter
was
written,
at
trial,
dr.
simopoulos
was
asked
the
question
as
to
whether
he
had
applied
for
an
out-patient
hospital
license,
and
at
the
time
of
the
events,
he
had
not,
but
he
said
at
trial
that
he
was
then
in
the
process
of
applying.
so
certainly
he
knew
at
that
time
that
it
was
possible.
the
virginia
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
did
not
focus
specifically
on
out-patient
hospital
facilities,
but
it
did
refer
to
the
broad
licensing
provisions
in
title
32.1
of
our
code,
and--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--certainly.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
the
part
2
does
not
limit
the
type
of
surgical
procedure
which
could
be
provided
within
that
facility.
there
are
four
which
are
licensed
as
part
2
facilities.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
indeed,
the
regulations
under
part
2
in
at
least
four
places
specifically
refer
to
the
provision
of
abortion
services
without
limitation
within
those
part
2
facilities.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
now,
they
are
also--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--that
is
correct,
sir.
without
limitation
as
to
trimester.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
the
virginia
abortion
statute
does
not
define
hospital.
as
you
noted
earlier
in
a
question,
that
is
defined
elsewhere,
and
it
includes
out-patient
surgical
facilities.
so,
the
abortion
requirement
which
requires
hospitalization
would
be
satisfied
by
performing
the
abortion
in
a
general
hospital,
an
acute
care
hospital,
or
in
an
out-patient
surgical
facility,
which
is
also
a
hospital
by
definition
under
the
code.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir,
licensed
by
the
commonwealth,
meeting
those
regulations
prescribed
by
the
commonwealth.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
except,
sir,
that
in
part
3
of
the
regulations,
by
virtue
of
the
regulations
themselves,
the
surgical
procedure
there
is
limited--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
quite
possibly
you
are
correct,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
i
am
not
aware
of
any
decisions
which
do
that,
justice
o'connor.
not
to
my
knowledge.
now,
in
roe
v.
wade,
this
court
noted
the
statistics
fully
support
the
conclusion
that
the
state's
interest
becomes
compelling
at
the
end
of
the
first
trimester.
that
is,
its
interest
in
protecting
maternal
health.
we
respectfully
submit
that
for
three
reasons
the
state's
interest
today
is
just
as
compelling
as
it
was
in
roe
v.
wade.
first,
the
mortality
rates
for
abortion
in
second
trimester
is
certainly
at
least
equal
to,
if
not
greater
than
mortality
rates
for
natural
childbirth.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
based
upon
the
table
2
in
dr.
simopoulos's
addendum
and
table
20
in
our
addendum,
i
believe
that
an
analysis
of
all
of
the
abortions
and
natural
childbirths
over
the
same
span
of
years
would
yield
that
result,
that
it
is
at
least
equal
to,
if
not
greater
than.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
when
one
includes
all
abortions
performed
in
the
first
trimester,
then
certainly
the
mortality
rate
will
be
lower,
because
that
is
90
percent
of
all
the
abortions,
and
the
mortality
rate
there
is
only
one.
as
one
goes
into
the
second
trimester,
there
are
certain
procedures
which
may
have
lower
mortality
rates
than
natural
childbirth,
but
considering
all
of
the
second
trimester
procedures
together,
the
rate
is
at
least
equal
to,
if
not
greater
than.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
in
1975,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
no,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
it
was...
the
revision
which
is
present
law
was
proposed
in
1974,
when
the
general
assembly
convened
following
this
court's
decision
in
roe
v.
wade.
it
was
not
adopted
at
that
time.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
in
this
particular
situation,
no,
sir,
and
as
a
general
proposition
there
is
no
legislative
history.
on
occasions
where
there
are
study
committees
and
things
of
that
nature,
there
would
be
some,
but
in
this
particular
situation
there
was
none.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
they
have
been
subsequently
amended
in
1980,
and
i
believe
again
in
'81.
i
don't
believe
that
the
amendments
are
material
in
terms
of
the
substantive
requirements.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
the
state
board
of
health,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir,
it
requires
public
hearings,
advertisement.
people
have
an
opportunity
for
input
and
consideration.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
i
can
only
assume
that
they--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--of
the
proceeding
itself?
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
i
don't
know
in
this
particular
case
whether
there
was
a
record
kept
or
not.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
there
is
advertisement,
and
there
are
also
various
means
of
dissemination
of
information
of
proposed
hearings
on
subjects.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
with
respect
to
the
adoption
of
the--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--of
the
regulations?
justice
white,
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
i
simply
do
not
know
how
extensive
the
public
interest
was
in
those
regulations.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
i
am
unable
to
advise
the
court
as
to
how
many
people
attended,
the
nature
of
the
discussion--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--no,
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
well,
the
basis
would
be
in
the
code
of
virginia,
which
provides
that
hospitals
may
be
or
would
include
out-patient
hospitals
under
regulations
authorized
and
promulgated
by
the
state
board
of
health,
meeting
certain
specified
requirements
in
the
code.
that's
the
basis
for
it.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
the
criminal
code
of
virginia
does.
yes,
sir.
now,
as
one
goes
into
procedures
such
as
saline
amniocentesis,
which
is
the
procedure
that
was
used
in
this
particular
case,
the
mortality
rate
is
substantially
higher
than
the
mortality
rate
for
live
birth,
and
as
one
considers
the
mortality
rate
for
second
trimester
abortions
in
relation
to
the
mortality
rate
for
first
trimester
abortions,
the
mortality
rate
for
second
trimester
abortions
is
much
higher.
it
is
at
least
five
times
higher
for
even
the
safest
second
trimester
procedure,
and
17
times
higher
for
the
procedure
which
was
utilized
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
that
is
exactly
right,
sir.
exactly
right.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
not
without
a
license.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
that's
correct,
sir.
it
did
not.
now,
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
only
this
year
changed
its
position
from
that
which
was
referred
to
in
roe
v.
wade,
and
they
have
suggested
that
there
are
certain
limited
procedures
within
a
certain
limited
time
in
the
early
part
of
the
second
trimester
of
pregnancy
which
in
their
opinion
may
be
safely
performed
outside
of
general
acute
care
hospitals.
but
they
say
that
even
those
procedures
should
be
performed
in
out-patient
facilities
meeting
the
requirements
for
surgical
out-patient
facilities
as
prescribed
by
the
states,
and
that
they
should
be
licensed
by
the
states.
virginia
law
requires
no
more
than
that
organization
recommends.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
they
are
referred
to,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
american
medical
association
and
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
in
the
other
two
cases
which
the
court
will
hear
this
afternoon,
and
i
believe
the
reference
specifically
would
be
on
page
23
and
24
of
that
brief.
virginia
would
respectfully
suggest
that
based
on
h.l.
v.
matheson,
it
is
not
incumbent
upon
it
to
fine
tune
its
statutes
to
facilitate
abortions,
but
if
fine
tuning
is
necessary
to
accommodate
any
proven
medical
advances,
which
are
not
present
in
this
particular
case,
but
if
that
were
the
obligation
imposed
upon
us,
then
certainly
the
legislature
would
be
capable
of
making
such
changes.
in
this
particular
situation,
even
dr.
cates,
who
suggests
that
certain
procedures
could
be
safely
performed
outside
of
hospitals,
acknowledges
in
an
article
printed
on
page
101
of
our
addendum
that
other
authorities,
to
use
his
term,
recommend
that
all
abortions
in
the
second
trimester
be
performed
in
hospitals.
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--certainly,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
i
believe,
sir,
that
the
information
in
the
addendum
suggests
that
there
are
approximately
3,000
abortions
performed
in
the
second
trimester,
and
that
they
were
performed,
or
at
least
there
is
other
information
in
the
addendum
that
suggests
that...
i
am
getting
somewhat
confused
on
my
facts.
i
believe
that
there
are
approximately
3,000
abortions
performed--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--in
the
second
trimester.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
there
are
requirements
that
the
clinics
and
the
hospitals
be
inspected
annually
to
ensure
that
they
continue
to
maintain
the
standards
that
they
are
required
to
keep.
beyond
that,
unless
it
comes
to
the
attention
of
a
local
prosecuting
authority
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
law,
then
i
don't
know
of
an
enforcement
program
as
such
designed
for
this
particular
procedure.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
well,
i
would
respectfully
suggest,
sir,
that
there
is
no
information
in
the
record
of
this
case
that
suggests
that
they
are
not
uniformly
performed
in
the
second
trimester.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
there
is
no
written
legislative
history
that
we
could
bring
before
this
court
that
would
indicate
the
nature
of
the
inquiry.
the
committee
did
make
inquiries
as
to
the
medical
health
concerns,
but
that
is
not
a
written
document
which--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--i
am
not
aware
of
any
other
prosecution,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
not
unless
he
is
possessing
a
license.
without
a
license,
there
would
be
no
inspection.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
there
would
be
no
obligation
for
the
state
department
of
health
to
make
such
an
investigation.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
none
in
the
record
of
the
trial.
that's
correct,
sir.
turning
briefly
to
the
two
criminal
law
related
questions,
virginia--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--the
defendant
put
on
experts
who
testified
that
in
their
opinion,
his
particular
facility
was
sufficiently
well
equipped,
that
it
was
safe
to
administer
the
procedure
within
that
facility.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
that's
correct,
sir.
he
did
not.
he
simply
tried
to
bring
himself,
as
i
read
the
record,
within
what
is
a--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
no,
sir.
no
violation,
so
long
as
he
didn't
perform
second
trimester
abortions
in
that
office.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
i
don't
know
of
any
other
criminal
law
requirements
for
hospitalization
requirements.
certainly
he
could
maintain
his
practice,
perform
first
trimester
abortions
in
that
facility.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
no,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
well,
i
would
respectfully
suggest,
sir,
that
surgeons
are
not
likely
to
perform
appendectomies
or
other
types
of
operations
in
their
offices.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
conceivably,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
certainly.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
i
apologize,
sir.
i
didn't
catch
your
question.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
no,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir,
i
would
agree.
now,
that
brings
up
the
medical
necessity
question.
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
authoritatively
construed
the
virginia
statute,
and
it
has
decided,
indeed,
it
decided
in
1966
or
'67
in
the
russo
case,
which
it
states
in
its
opinion,
that
the
medical
necessity
issue
is
a
matter
for
the
defense
to
assert,
and
once
the
defense
asserts
it,
then
the
burden
is
placed
upon
the
commonwealth
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
no
medical
necessity.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
that
could
be
brought
about
either
through
the
cross
examination
of
witnesses
for
the
prosecution,
by
the
introduction
of
witnesses
on
his
own
behalf,
or
through
any
other
means
which
brings
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
the
prosecution.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
that's
correct,
sir.
that's
absolutely
correct.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
counsel
for
dr.
simopoulos
argued
that
the
indictment
was
effective
because
it
did
not
affirmatively
negate
medical
necessity,
and
that
was
the
argument
which
i
believe
the
court
will
find
if
it
examines
the
transcript.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
will
find
an
argument
that
the
commonwealth
was
affirmatively
under
the
constitutional
obligation
to
prove
in
its
case
in
chief
that
there
was
no
medical
necessity.
dr.
simopoulos
we
do
not
believe
invoked
that
defense
at
trial,
and
how
could
he?
he
stated
that
the
girl's
condition
was
normal
which
he
ascertained
as
a
result
of
his
examination
of
her.
he
stated
that
she
could
carry
the
fetus
to
term.
he
stated,
and
i
quote,
that
"the
option
of
abortion
was
entirely
up
to
her,
and
i
had
no
business
in
influencing
her
one
way
or
the
other.
"
he
simply
left
the
decision
entirely
up
to
her.
so,
we
submit
that
he
has
no
standing
to
assert
that
issue
at
this
time,
but
in
any
event,
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
found
that
there
was
no
medical
necessity.
that
finding
is
certainly
supported
by
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record.
also,
the
court's
construction
of
the
statute
does
not
in
any
way
implicate
improperly
presumptions
or
in
key
elements
of
a
crime.
such
was
the
case
in
mullaney
or
in
sandstrom.
the
defense
is
never
required
to
shoulder
the
burden
of
proof.
it
simply
has
to
invoke
the
defense.
i
think
that
that
will
make
this
particular
situation
fall
well
within
this
court's
decision
last
term
of
engle
versus
isaacs,
where
the
defense
merely
had
to
invoke
the
defense
of
self-defense.
the
prosecution
then
had
to
affirmatively
disprove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
the
court
concluded
that
even
in
those
circumstances,
that
did
not
mean
that
on
its
case
in
chief,
the
prosecution
had
to
disprove
that
as
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
prior
to
'77,
sir?
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
i
think
prior
to
'77,
sir,
it
would
have
been
possible
to
perform
it
legally
only
within
a
conventional
general
acute
care
hospital,
because
the
state
prior
to
that
time
did
not
have
the
licensing
requirements
for
out-patient
hospitals.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
on
the
issue
of
causation,
which
is
mentioned
in
dr.
simopoulos's
brief,
we
shall
touch
upon
that
very
quickly.
again,
the
starting
point
is
the
doctor's
own
examination,
in
which
he
stated
that
her
condition
was
normal,
and
that
she
could
carry
the
fetus
to
term.
he
then
injected
her
with
a
saline
solution
for
one
purpose,
to
induce
an
abortion.
that
was
the
only
purpose.
his
own
witness
testified
that
the
procedure
works
at
least
90
percent
of
the
time,
and
an
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
bulletin,
which
we
have
printed
on
page
78
of
our
addendum,
states
the
procedure
is
effective
97
percent
of
the
time
within
72
hours.
between
the
time
of
the
injection
and
the
delivery,
the
girl
had
only
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwiches,
and
pain
pills
prescribed
by
the
doctor.
there
was
no
other
intervening
cause
which
was
likely
to
bring
about
an
abortion.
within
the
normal
time--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--she
told
the
doctor,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
she
was
going
to
go
to
a
motel.
he
said
that
was
okay.
and
when
she
went
to
the
motel
for
the
period
of...
prior
to
delivery,
she
carried
with
her
that
supply.
within
the
normal
time
period
within
which
the
procedure
is
predicted
to
work,
in
fact,
it
did
work.
she
delivered
her
fetus
just
as
simopoulos
had
predicted,
and
just
as
he
had
intended.
so
when
the
evidence
is
viewed
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
prosecution,
as
it
must
be,
certainly
it
is
sufficient
to
permit
a
rational
trier
of
fact
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
crime
was
committed.
for
the
reasons
which
we
have
stated
and
the
reasons
in
our
brief,
we
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
the
procedure,
the
surgical
procedure
has
to
be
performed
within
the
hospital.
certain
procedures
can
be
performed,
and
that
is
the
entire
culmination
of
the
process.
in
this
particular
situation--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
presumably
so,
sir,
even
in
a
general
acute
care
hospital
presumably
that
would
have
been
the
situation.
she
would
have
been
instructed
to
return
at
the
appropriate
time
for
the
delivery
of
the
fetus.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir,
for
the
interval
between
the
administration
of
the
procedure
and
the
time
when
the
delivery
is
anticipated
to
occur.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
if
i
may
answer
the
question,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
is
a
matter
in
dispute.
the
doctor
testified
that
he
did
instruct
her--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--that
he
did
instruct
her
to
return.
his
nurse
gave
her
a
set
of
written
instructions
which
do
state
that
she
should
return.
the
girl
stated
that
he
never
instructed
her
to
return,
that
she
told
him
she
was
going
to
a
motel.
he
said
that
was
okay,
and
she
knew
exactly
what
he
meant
by
that,
and
that
when
she
read
the
instructions
after
she
left
his
office,
she
was
confused
because
she
had
previously
clearly
understood
that
he
knew
that
she
was
not
coming
to
the
hospital
at
any
time.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
it
is
distressing.
yes,
sir.
