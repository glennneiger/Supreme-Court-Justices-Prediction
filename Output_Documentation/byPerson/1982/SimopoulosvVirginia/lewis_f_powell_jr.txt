--it
would
help
me
if
you
would
describe
the
type
of
clinic,
tell
me
whether
it
is
licensed
under
virginia
law
as
an
out-patient
hospital.
justice

was
the
clinic
licensed
under
the
laws
of
virginia?
justice

f.
powell,

well,
that
was
after
all
these

occurred,
though,

it
not?
justice

but
only
for...
second
trimester
abortions
are
different
from
the
first
trimester
abortions
that
can
be
performed
in
a
different
type
surgical
hospital.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
category
under
the
virginia
regulations
of
out-patient
surgical
hospitals,
and
i
assumed
that
they
were
the
places
that
under
virginia
law
second
trimester
abortions
normally
would
be
performed.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

mr.
attorney
general,
when
you
said
that
one
of
the
requirements
was
that
these
second
trimester
abortions
be
performed
in
hospitals,
i
take
it
from
what
you
have
subsequently
said
that
you
are
talking
about
the
out-patient
surgical
type
hospitals
described
in
part
2
of
the
regulations?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
were
the
regulations
adopted
in
june,
1977,
in
effect
at
all
times
relevant
to
this
case?
