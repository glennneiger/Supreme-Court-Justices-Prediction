chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
81-185,
simopoulos
against
virginia.
mr.
lucas,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
are
these
factors
relevant
to
the
basic
issue
presented?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
fail
to
see
what
they
have
to
do
with
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
broaddus.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
hospital,
when
you
said
hospital
in
response
to
that
last
question,
that
includes
any
clinic
like
the
petitioner's,
the
appellant's
clinic
here
if
he
had
secured
a
license
as
an
out-patient
hospital.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
doesn't
mean...
the
statute
does
not...
is
not
limited
to
a
hospital
in
the
traditional
sense
that
we
think
of
hospitals.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
those
standards
in
evidence
in
this
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
referred
to
investigations
or
inspections,
periodic
inspections
by
the
state
health
department
of
hospitals.
that
is
done
on
an
annual
basis,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
does
the
state
department
of
health
inspect
in
any
way
establishments
of
the
kind
that
this
appellant
was
operating?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
has
he
been
subject
to
any
periodic
examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
would
be
just
like
any
other
doctor's
office.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
except
in
an
emergency,
conceivably.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
a
patient
came
to
the
office,
and
it
was
obvious
that
there
was
a
ruptured
appendix,
conceivably
he
might
be
justified
in
doing
it
right
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lucas.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
