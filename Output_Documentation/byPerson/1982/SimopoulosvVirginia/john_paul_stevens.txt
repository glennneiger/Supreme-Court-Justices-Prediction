justice
john
paul

may
i
ask
you,
mr.
lucas,
one
other
question
on
the
virginia
regulations,
just
to
be
sure
i
understand
it
correctly?
part
3
deals
with
"hospitals"
that
are
abortion
clinics
in
which
only
first
trimester
abortions
may
be
performed.
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
your
client
did
not
even
have
that
kind
of
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
broaddus,
may
i
interrupt--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--just
to
be
sure
you
completed
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor?
you
said
there
were
four
facilities
that
had
been
licensed
as
clinics.
is
that
pursuant
to
part
2
of
the
regulations
that
relate
not
to
the
abortion
clinics
but
to
out-patient
clinics?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
are
they
licensed...
and
you
say...
those
four
facilities
are
licensed
to
perform
second
trimester
abortions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
they
lawfully
perform
second
trimester
abortions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
read
the
statute
literally,
it
even
would
not
have
been
violated
if
he
had
had
a
license
under
part
3
of
the
regulations,
because
it
is
still
a
hospital,
but
it
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
might
have
violated
those
regulations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
am
not
sure
he
would
have
violated
the
statute
under
which--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
regulations
recite
there
was
a
public
hearing
on
january
26th,
1977.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
broaddus,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
fine
tuning
comment
made
me
think
of
this.
is
it
not
correct,
though,
that
within
the
second
trimester,
that
there
is
only
one
justification
for
regulating
the
procedure,
namely,
protect
the
maternal
health
of
the
woman
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
something
in
the
record,
i
can't
remember
what
it
is,
indicated
there
were
some
6,000
second
trimester
abortions
performed
in
virginia.
is
it
safe
to
assume
that
the
state
is
making
sure
that
all
of
those
are
performed
according
to
the
standards
that
are...
the
health
standards
that
you
are
advocating?
justice
john
paul
stevens
during
what
period
of
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
during
what...
during
a
year,
or
during--
--for
1978,
and
1979
a
similar
number.
and
there
is
some
kind
of
an
enforcement
program
to
be
sure
they
have
all
been
performed
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
in
fact
a
significant
number
of
them
were
not
being
performed
in
appropriate
facilities
by
reason
of
the
statute,
then
the
question,
i
think,
would
arise
as
to
whether
the
statute
is
in
the
best
health
interests
of
the
people
involved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
take
it
there
is
no
legislative
history
indicating
what
kind
of
an
inquiry
the
legislature
made
as
to
the
possible
impact
of
this
statute
on
where
these
operations
might
be
performed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
far
as
public
records
goes,
is
this
the
only
prosecution
involving
a
second
trimester
abortion
of
which
we
have
any
official
knowledge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
apart
from
the
criminal
law,
is
there
any
virginia
statute
that
restricts
the
kind
of
operation
he
might
perform
in
that
facility
other
than
second
trimester
abortions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
brain
surgery
or
anything
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
could
do
that
at
home.
he
could
do
that
at
home,
i
guess,
brain
surgery.

justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
broaddus,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
history?
because
when
i
first
read
this
statute,
i
understood
it
to
require
the
procedure
to
be
performed
in
a
conventional
hospital,
and
i
have
since
learned
that
since
1977,
at
least,
it
is
permissible
to
perform
it
in
these
other
licensed
facilities.
during
the
interval
between
the
period
when
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1977
when
the
regulations
were
adopted,
could
the
procedure
have
been
performed
in
any
facility
other
than
a
conventional
hospital?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
in
other
words,
i
am
just
wondering
what
the
legislature
was
thinking
of
when
it
enacted
the
statute.
