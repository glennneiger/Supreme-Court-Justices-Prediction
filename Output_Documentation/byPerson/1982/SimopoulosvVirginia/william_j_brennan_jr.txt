justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
never
applied
before?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
yes,
again
but
this
was
after
the
events
that
led
to
his
indictment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
getting
to
my
brother
powell's
question
to
you,
could
he
have
applied
for
certification
as
an
out-patient
surgical
hospital?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
wasn't
my
question.
could
he
have
applied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
anyone
tried
to
get
certification
as
an
out-patient
surgical
hospital?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
did...
dr.
simopoulos
also
did
first
trimester
abortions,
did
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
never
sought
first
certification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
am
really
getting
to,
are
there...
of
the...
i
gather
there
are
several
clinics
rather
than
hospitals,
abortion
clinics,
are
there
not,
in
virginia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
and
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
how
many,
if
any,
of
them
have
obtained
certification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
be
clear
about
this,
mr.
lucas?
you
never
have
taken
the
position,
have
you,
that
the
absence
of
medical
necessity
was
an
element
of
the
offense
for
the
state
to
prove?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have?
but
you
are
not
taking
that
here
today?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand.
are
you
taking
the
position
that
medical
necessity
is
a
matter
of
defense
which
then
shifts
the
burden
of
going
forward
to
the
state,
or
are
you
taking
the
position
that
as
part
of
the
state's
case
it
had
to
prove
no
medical
necessity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
latter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--can
you
briefly
state,
mr.
broaddus,
what
the
procedure
is
for
doing
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
dr.
simopoulos
had
done
all
those
things,
he
might
have
made
an
application
to
what
agency?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
might
have
granted
him
such
a
certificate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
this
very
clinic?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
for
second
trimester?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
long
as
it...
it
has
to
be
licensed.
is
that--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather,
mr.
broaddus,
it
is
no
violation,
criminal
or
otherwise,
is
it,
or
was
it,
for
him
to
operate
without
a
license?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
or
some
other
operations
that
might
require
hospitalization,
without
a
certificate
that
he
might
do
so.
