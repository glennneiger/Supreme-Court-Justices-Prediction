justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
know
what
that
basis
is?
there
isn't
anything
in
the
record
on
it,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
it
could
have
been,
i
suppose,
either,
at
one
extreme
they
could
have
had
a
$1,000
investment
in
their
stock,
or
a
zero
investment,
in
which
case
there'd
be
no
basis
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
am
i
correct
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
tell
us
what
the
basis
of
the
shareholders
in
the
feed
that
they
acquired
after
the
liquidation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
be
zero.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
that's
the
basis
in
the
stock
or
the
basis
in
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
that
feed
had
been
consumed
entirely
in
the
prior
year,
what
difference
would
it
have
made
to
the
stockholders
on
liquidation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
also
ask,
in
view
of
your
latest,
if
you
agree
with
the
hypothetical
that
your
opponent
suggested,
that
if
instead
of
refunding
the
money
to
the
shareholders
the
state
of
illinois
or
the
county
just
kept
the
money,
even
though
not
entitled
to
do
so,
that
would
still...
the
tax
benefit
rule
would
still
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
what
in
the
dairy
case,
what
is
the
difference
in
the
facts
at
the
time
the
deduction
was
taken
and
the
facts
as
they
later
materialized?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
true,
not
in
the
bank
stock
situation,
not
under
164.
there's
only
one
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
it
not
true
that
if
there
were
no
basis
in
the
stock...
say
they
got
the
stock
it
$1,000,
some
nominal
amount,
so
that
there
would
be
not
a
stepped-up
basis
but
a
stepped-down
basis...
your
theory
would
be
precisely
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
really,
this
is
totally
irrelevant.
your
whole
point
is
that
they
were
expensed
items
that
were
not
used
up
before
they
went
out
of
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
inventory
always
has
to
be
charged
back.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
how
do
we
know
that
more
often
the
stock
has
gone
up
rather
than
down
in
value?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
mean
in
any
case,
in
the
generality
of
the
universe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
there's
$55,000
worth
of
feed
and
that's
the
only
corporate
asset
and
that's
the
exact
amount
they
paid
for
the
stock.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
they'd
be
paying
$55,000
for
it
just
as
though
they
bought
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question.
supposing
a
football
team
hires
a
player
on
a
five-year
contract,
pays
him
a
lump
sump
on
the
assumption
he'll
play
for
five
years,
and
then
at
the
end
of
one
year
he
gets
killed,
he
can't
play
it
out.
do
they
lose
the
benefit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
assumption
that
he'll
be
playing
for
five
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
made
the
payment
because
they
expected
to
use
his
services
before...
say
they
go
out
of
business
and
then
he's
still
around,
as
with
the
case
of
the
feed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
that
case
then
there'd
be
a
tax
benefit
recovery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
you
apply
it
differently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
it's
just
two
seasons,
like
the
feed
they
expect
to
use
up
in
18
months
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
they're
both
expense
items.
they
both,
they
expect
to
use
it
within
a
foreseeable
period
of
time
but
beyond
the
end
of
the
taxable
year.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
nash,
isn't
it
true
that
at
the
time
they
set
up
the
reserve
for
bad
debts
they
assumed
the
corporation
would
continue
in
business
for
such
time
as
would
be
necessary
to
see
who
paid
their
bills
and
who
didn't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
if
you
say
that,
the
assumption
here
is
about
using
the
feed
to
feed
the
cattle,
and
presumably
that's
what
they
did
with
the
feed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
recovery,
you
say,
to
the
shareholders,
who
in
turn
own
the
bank,
but
your
rule
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
they
had
all
sold
their
stock
and
you
had
an
entirely
different
group
of
owners,
because
it
would
then
go
to
former
shareholders.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
really
isn't
necessarily
any
recovery.
