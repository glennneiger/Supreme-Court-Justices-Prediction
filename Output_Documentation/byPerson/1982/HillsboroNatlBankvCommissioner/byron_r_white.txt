justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
why
was
the
deduction
allowed
in
the
first
place,
paying
a
tax
on
behalf
of
someone
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
statutory--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
the
shareholders
need
not
treat
that
as
a
dividend?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
the
shareholders
treat
this
return
of
the
tax
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
taxpayers
paid
the
tax
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
doubt
that
what
the
internal
revenue
service
has
construed
the
statute
contrary
to
your
submission?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
they
have
been
construing
it
contrary
to
your
submission?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
this
subsequent
congressional
history
is
irrelevant,
too,
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
consistent.
this
position
is
consistent
with
their
position
in
other
contexts.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
must
convince
us,
to
win,
that
the
statute
just
won't
yield
to
this
kind
of
construction,
that
it's
just
not
within
the
realm
of
statutory
construction
to
apply
it
the
way
the
service--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
i
take
it
you
think
your
case
is
different
from
the
one
that
was
just
argued?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
relying
on
this
being
a
liquidation.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
different
from
hillsboro.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
just
as
though
the
stockholders
had
bought
the
feed
from
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they'd
have
bought
it...
suppose
this
corporation
hadn't
gone
out
of
existence,
but
the
corporation
had
sold
some
feed
to
one
of
the
stockholders.
justice
byron
r.
white
possibly,
but
there
might
not
have
been,
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
stockholders
could
have
deducted
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
nevertheless
have
paid
for
the
feed
by
turning
in
their
stock,
which
was
worth
a
certain
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't...
if
you
say
you're
going
to
bring
it
back
into
income,
why
shouldn't
it
be
income
if
you're
going
to
bring
it
into
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
this,
how
did
hillsboro,
get
any
income
in
this
later
period?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
the
whole
point
of
it
was
not
to
recover
income,
but
to
recover
a
deduction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore
you
have
to
treat
it
as
income
in
the
later
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it
isn't
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
never
was
anything
it
owed.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statutory
permission
for
a
deduction
just
wasn't
satisfied.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think,
in
justice
stevens'
example
do
you
think
that
in
any
event
could
the
football
team
deduct
the
entire
payment
in
one
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
urging
of
the
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
an
administrative
interpretation.
justice
byron
r.
white
validated
by
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
recovery?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
the
service
insist
on
amending
the
82
return
in
the
chief
justice's
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
the
loss
is
in
82
and
the
recovery
is
the
next
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
but
it
now
turns
out
that
it
was
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
the
service
go
back
and
recover
it
in
the
previous
year
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
a
loss
in
that
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't...
you
say
the
service
could
not
reopen
the
82
return
in
the
chief
justice's
example,--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
they
would
lose
their
case
if
they
attempted
to
make
anl
assessment
for
82
based
on
the
recovery
of
the
$800,000
in
83.
