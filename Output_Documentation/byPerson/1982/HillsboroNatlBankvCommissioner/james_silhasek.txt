mr.
james
silhasek
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
as
mr.
stephens
has
set
forth,
the
tax
benefit
rule
requires
that
an
item
properly
offset
against
gross
income
in
determining
the
true
liability
for
a
particular
year
is
includable
in
the
gross
income
when
it
is
recovered
in
a
subsequent
year.
in
effect,
there
are
the
three
elements,
that
is:
an
item
that
was
previously
deducted,
that
resulted
in
a
tax
benefit,
and
it
was
subsequently
recovered
in
a
later
year.
the
government
has
sought
to
resurrect
the
early
applications
of
the
tax
benefit
rule,
which
held
that
an
end
of
need
constituted
a
recovery.
that
rule
was
laid
to
rest
by
this
court
in
the
nash
decision.
as
such,
an
actual
recovery
is
required
for
the
application
of
the
tax
benefit
rule.
in
the
case
involving
bliss
dairy,
there
was
an
amount
that
was
previously
deducted
by
the
corporation
that
resulted
in
a
tax
benefit.
that
amount
was
not,
however,
recovered
during
the
taxable
year
in
issue
as
a
result
of
the
liquidation
of
the
corporation
or,
for
that
fact,
ever
recovered
by
the
corporation.
the
attempt
to
apply
the
tax
benefit
rule
to
a
liquidation
under
sections
333
and
336
of
the
internal
revenue
code
is
not
only
prevented
by
the
concise
words
of
the
statute--
mr.
james
silhasek
--no
one
received
the
benefit,
your
honor.
mr.
james
silhasek
it
really,
in
this
situation,
as
i'll
explain
it,
it
really
doesn't
make
that
much
difference,
because
the
stockholders,
when
they
received
the
assets,
fair
market
value,
the
fact
that
it
was
depreciated
or
expensed
made
no
difference
to
them.
mr.
james
silhasek
no,
it
would
not
have.
it
would
not
have
been
an
expense,
because
their
basis
in
the
assets
that
they
received,
for
which
they
can
deduct,
is
determined
by
their
basis
in
the
stock
they
had
in
the
corporation.
it
makes
no
difference
as
to
the
fair
market
value
of
the
asset
or
if
it
was
expensed
by
the
corporation.
again,
it's
not
only--
mr.
james
silhasek
--they
have
had
that
opportunity,
and
again,
they
have
avoided
it.
and
just
as
recently
as
last
thursday,
the
chairman
of
the
senate
finance
committee
said
he
was
going
to
propose
more
legislation.
but
they
have
had
that
opportunity
on
several
occasions
and
have
not
passed
any
legislation
that
would
have
affected
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
james
silhasek
i
believe
so,
because
in
looking
at
the
entire
view
of
this
transaction
there
really
is
not
an
avoidance,
a
tax
avoidance,
or
a
benefit
that
was
recovered
or
recaptured
by
either
party.
in
this
particular
case,
the
corporation
made
purchases
of
cattle
feed
during
its
fiscal
year
ending
june
30,
1973.
the
corporation,
in
accordance
with
the
cash
method
of
accounting,
properly
deducted
the
amount
expended
for
the
cattle
feed
as
a
business
expense
on
the
tax
return
filed
for
that
fiscal
year.
during
the
next
fiscal
year,
the
corporation
adopted
a
plan
of
liquidation
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
sections
333
and
336.
mr.
james
silhasek
yes,
your
honor.
under
333,
when
you
adopt
a
plan,
it
has
to
adopt
a
plan
of
liquidation
and
totally
distribute
its
assets
within
a
30-day
period.
mr.
james
silhasek
yes,
your
honor,
they
did,
although
they
purchased
the
feed...
that
was
expensed
throughout
the
taxable
year.
it
was
not
a
purchase
made
immediately
before
liquidation
or
anything
of
that
nature.
as
a
result
of
the
plan,
the
corporation
distribute
all
of
its
assets
to
its
shareholders
in
redemption
of
all
the
stock
issued
and
outstanding
by
the
corporation
and
went
out
of
business.
simply
stated,
the
corporation
received
no
consideration
upon
distribution
of
its
assets
to
its
shareholders
upon
liquidation.
the
corporation
only
received
its
stock
in
return
for
the
distributed
property,
the
value
of
which
upon
the
cessation
of
business
and
distribution
of
the
assets
was
nil.
there
is
no
reason
why
the
tax
benefit
rule
should
override
the
specific
language
of
the
statute.
section
336
of
the
internal
revenue
code
in
effect
during
the
year
in
question
specifically
states
that
there
is
no
gain
or
loss
recognized
to
a
corporation
on
distribution
of
property
in
partial
or
complete
liquidation.
there
are
certain
statutory
excepts
to
the
statute,
but
none
of
them
are
applicable
in
this
case.
the
language
and
intent
of
the
congress
is
clear
with
respect
to
this
statute.
congress
has
had,
as
we
mentioned,
the
opportunity
to
amend
this
statute
as
recent
as
the
enactment
of
the
tax
equity
and
fiscal
responsibility
act
of
1982.
mr.
james
silhasek
any
doubt
in
my
mind?
mr.
james
silhasek
not...
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
case
has
ever
come
up
in
this
situation,
outside
of
tennessee-carolina,
your
honor.
they
have
never
attempted
to
apply
the
tax
benefit
rule
in
a
333
liquidation
where
there's
been
a
distribution
of
assets
to
the
shareholders
that
were
subsequently
expensed.
mr.
james
silhasek
they
have
attempted
to
apply
this
in
other
types
of
liquidations,
but
they
have
had
this
problem--
mr.
james
silhasek
--there
are
other
cases.
they
have
not
reached
the
court,
your
honor,
but
as
the
government
said
in
their
brief,
there
are
many
cases
depending
upon
the
outcome
of
this
case.
so
apparently
they
have
applied
it
in
many
cases
that
are
not
of
public
record
at
this
time.
mr.
james
silhasek
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
silhasek
hillsboro?
mr.
james
silhasek
as
far
as...
it's
totally
different
factually,
but
as
far
as
the
application
of
the
tax
benefit
rule
it's
the
same,
because
there
was
no
recovery
in
this
situation.
there
was
a
deduction,
there
was
a
tax
benefit,
but
the
amount
was
never
recovered.
mr.
james
silhasek
specifically
on
the
statute,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
silhasek
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
government
has
asserted
that
the
non-application
of
the
tax
benefit
rule
in
this
situation
would
result
in
a
double
deduction.
however,
a
complete
view
of
the
entire
transaction
clearly
reflects
that
there
was
not
a
double
deduction.
it
is
true
that
the
feed
was
written
off
by
the
corporation,
with
the
write-off
equaling
the
amount
that
the
corporation
paid
for
the
feed.
in
the
subsequent
year
a
portion
of
that
feed
was
distributed
to
the
shareholders
in
liquidation
and
the
shareholders
received
a
basis
in
that
feed
equal
to
the
basis
they
had
in
the
stock
of
the
corporation.
mr.
james
silhasek
similar
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
silhasek
if
they
had
sold
it
to
one
of
the
stockholders,
in
that
situation
there
possibly
would
have
been
gain
to
the
corporation.
mr.
james
silhasek
they
would
have
had
to
pay
a
fair,
a
full...
the
difference
is,
though,
in
purchasing
that
feed
they
would
have
paid
the
full
market
value
for
that
feed.
mr.
james
silhasek
they
could
have
deducted
it,
but
they
would
have
paid
substantially
more,
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
silhasek
that's
correct.
the
basis
that
the
shareholders
received
in
the
feed
was
not
a
stepped-up
basis,
that
is
stepped
up
to
the
fair
market
value,
but
was
the
basis
as
it
relates
to
the
basis
they
had
in
their
stock.
it
is
only
by
the
fact
that
they
acquired
a
basis
in
the
feed
that
they
were
able
to
deduct
the
stock.
it
is
not
a
situation
where
the
fair
market
value
of
an
item
is
deducted
once
and
then
again
the
fair
market
value
of
the
item
is
deducted.
the
second
deduction
emanates
from
the
fact
that
the
shareholders
received
a
new
basis
in
the
asset.
mr.
james
silhasek
no,
your
honor.
it
was
not
a
stipulated
fact.
mr.
james
silhasek
your
honor,
in
the
lower
court
we
were
only
concerned
with
the
effect
of
the
statute,
the
government's
position,
to
override
section
333
without
taking
into
consideration
the
effect
on
the
shareholders.
in
their
brief
for
certiorari,
they
raised
this
point
concerning
the
double
deduction,
i
think
it
was
only
briefly
mentioned,
that
in
the
early
cases...
that
there
would
be
some
inequity
because
of
the
possibility
of
a
double
deduction.
mr.
james
silhasek
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
silhasek
i'm
sorry.
there
is
no
basis
in
their
stock.
it
is
in
the
record
what
their
basis
in
the
feed
was,
because
as
a
result
of
the
liquidation
their
basis
is
determined
by
section
334(c),
which
has
the
basis
in
their
stock
subject
to
certain
adjustments.
that
is,
if
they
receive
cash,
if
they
recognize
gain,
or
if
they
have
to
assume
any
liabilities
of
the
corporation.
so
it
is
in
the
record
what
their
basis
in
the
stock
was.
mr.
james
silhasek
approximately
$55,000,
your
honor.
mr.
james
silhasek
excuse
me.
the
basis
in
the
feed
that
they
received.
mr.
james
silhasek
it
would
have
meant...
probably
made
no
difference,
because
upon
liquidation
their
basis
in
the
assets
that
they
received
is,
they
take
the
basis
in
their
stock
and
distribute
it
over
the
assets
that
they
received.
so
if
they
received
one
bail
of
hay
or
if
they
received
a
whole
truckload,
whatever
their
basis
in
the
stock
was
is
distributed
over
those
assets.
mr.
james
silhasek
no
benefit
to
the
corporation
upon
liquidation,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
silhasek
i
see
no
benefit
to
them
either,
because
they
would
have
written
off...
when
they
received
that
feed,
what
they
wrote
off
was
the
basis
they
had
in
the
stock.
it's
similar
to
a
reverse
of
incorporation,
where
stockholders
form
a
corporation.
they
may
put
in
assets
that
have
a
very
low
basis
and
receive
stock
having
a
fair
market
value
equal
to
the
fair
market
value
of
the
assets
that
they
use
for
incorporation.
they
recognize
no
gain
at
that
time,
even
though
they
have
received
something
substantially
increased
in
value,
and
that's
because
of
the
statute
involved.
if
they
were
to
sell
their
stock,
however,
the
basis
in
their
stock
is
the
same
as
the
basis
they
had
in
their
assets.
therefore,
they
would
recognize
gain
based
on
the
difference
between
the
fair
market
value
of
the
stock
and
the
basis
they
had
in
the
assets.
as
a
part
of
the
complete
view
of
the
transaction,
we
should
examine
the
statutory
pattern
of
a
liquidation
under
section
333.
again,
the
purpose
of
that
statute
was
to
allow
people
to
disinvolve
themselves
with
the
corporate
entity.
they
had
formed
a
corporation;
to
allow
them
to
get
out
of
a
corporation
by
distribution
of
assets.
it
must
also
be
noted
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
they
would
not
have
received
cash
sufficient
to
pay
tax
on
any
gain.
so
what
the
statute
provides
is
that
upon
liquidation,
under
this
type
of
liquidation,
they
get
the
assets
out
even
if
they
had
appreciated
substantially
in
value,
but
the
basis
remains
the
same
as
the
basis
they
had
in
the
stock.
so
if
there's
a
subsequent
sale,
it
is
that
time
that
the
gain
is
recognized
upon
the
sale
of
those
assets
received
by
the
shareholders.
in
our
instance,
these
assets
were
of
the
type
that
the
shareholder
could
expense
them
rather
than
having
to
sell
them
as
if
they
were
an
asset
that
was
not
subject
to
expensing,
because
of
the
type
of
business
they
were
engaged
in.
reliance
by
the
government
on
cases
involving
liquidations
under
sections
331
and
337
is
misplaced
because
those
cases
do
not
in
fact
involve
the
application
of
the
tax
benefit
rule
to
the
liquidating
distribution.
they
provide
for
the
application
of
the
tax
benefit
rule
to
sales
made
by
the
corporation
prior
to
liquidation.
under
section
337
there
is
no
gain
or
loss
on
sales
or
exchanges
of
corporate
property
that
accrue
within
a
12-month
period
following
the
adoption
of
a
plan
for
liquidation,
but
prior
to
the
actual
liquidating
distribution.
the
courts
have
allowed
the
application
of
this
tax
benefit
rule
or
tax
benefit
principles
even
though
it
is
contrary
to
the
specific
language.
basically,
i
feel
they
have
allowed
it
because
of
two
things:
one,
there
was
an
actual
recovery
in
those
instances;
two,
they
have
looked
to
the
purpose
of
that
statutory
language
and
held
that
the
purpose
of
that
language
was
really
to
prevent
the
results
that
occurred
under
the
court
holding
case,
rather
than
to
override
any
type
of
application
of
the
tax
benefit
rule.
the
cases
of
south
lake
farms
and
tennessee-carolina
involved
liquidations
wherein
there
was
a
distribution
rather
than
a
sale
of
assets.
while
those
cases
involved
similar
factual
situations,
the
courts
obviously
reached
a
different
result.
