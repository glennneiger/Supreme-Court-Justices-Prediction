what
about
the
corporate
shareholders?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
stephens,
suppose
the
commissioner
is
right
in
your
case.
does
it
make
any
difference
to
the
bank
whether
it
is
thrown
into
fiscal
'72
or
fiscal
'73?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
right
away,
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
fiscal
year?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
they
did
it
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
taxable
year.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general,
wait.
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
doesn't
the
government
do
this
every
day
when
it
audits
a
person's
return?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
in
both
these
cases
why
didn't
the
government
merely
throw
or
limit
the
deduction
that
was
taken
in
the
original
year?
does
it
make
a
difference
to
the
government
which
year?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
is
that
a
problem
at
all
if
the
statute
of
limitations
hasn't
expired?
what
bothers
me
is
a
statement
in
your
brief:
"the
proper
remedy
for
taking
account
of
such
changed
circumstances
is
not
to
amend
or
modify
the
original
return,
but
rather
to
reflect
the
change
in
the
return
covering
the
later
period.
"
why
is
that
so?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
seems
to
me
again
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
precision
in
annual
accounting
for
income
tax
purposes
is
a
secondary
consideration,
not
a
primary
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
can
understand
that
statement,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
lot
less
distortion
if
you
put
it
in
the
original--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--taxable
year.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
might
not,
depending
on
the
taxpayer's
particular
situation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
guess
i'm
a
firm
believer
in
accuracy
rather
than
theory.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
don't
you
merely
reduce
the
deduction
in
the
original
year?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
don't
they
do
that
all
the
time?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they're
closed
until
they're
audited.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
lee,
before
you
sit
down...
i
notice
the
white
light
has
gone
on...
somewhere
would
you
comment
on
nash?
