justice

day
o'connor
mr.
silhasek,
i'd
like
to
ask
you,
if
i
may,
what
weight
we
should
give
to
the
failure
of
the
94th
congress
to
enact
a
change
to
section
1245
to
apply
it
to
recapture
of
section
162
expenses?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
should
we
give
any
weight
to
that,
one
way
or
another?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lee,
before
you
return
to
bliss,
if
i
may,
you've
argued,
as
i
understand
it,
that
if
we
reverse
in
hillsboro
we
will
be
giving
the
corporation
a
deductible
dividend.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
isn't
that
exactly
what
section
164(e)
always
gives
the
corporation,
a
deductible
dividend?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
also,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
if
the
refund
checks
in
hillsboro
had
been
stolen
before
they
got
to
the
shareholders,
your
position
would
be
the
same,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
still
a
tax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
lee,
certainly
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
would
support
the
taxpayer
argument
in
bliss.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
congress
has
had
an
opportunity
to
correct
it
and
hasn't
done
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
has
been
a
judge-made
exception
to
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lee,
it
seems
that
you're
arguing
for
a
rather
broad
rule
here
and
it
concerns
me
a
little
bit,
because
normally
somebody,
for
example,
who
takes
property
from
a
decedent
gets
a
step
up
to
fair
market
value.
and
if
your
theory
were
applicable
then
a
decedent
who
had
expensed
an
asset
under
section
162
and
then
died,
does
that
mean
that
it
would
have
the
effect
of
no
stepped-up
basis
and
there
is
going
to
be
a
tax
consequence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
your
theory,
if
broadly
followed,
would
lead
to
some
surprising
consequences
for
decedents'
estates
or
donors
of
property.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
the
foot
in
the
door,
i
suppose.
you'll
be
back.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
consolidated
cases
present
questions
of
the
application
of
the
tax
benefit
rule.
hillsboro
national
bank
versus
commissioner
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
in
this
case,
a
bank
took
the
deduction
allowed
by
section
164(e)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
for
the
payment
of
its
shareholder
taxes.
later,
the
state
taxes
were
refunded
by
the
state
but
directly
to
the
shareholders
rather
than
to
the
bank.
the
shareholders
included
the
refund
in
their
income
and
the
commissioner
sought
to
include
it
in
the
income
of
the
bank
as
well
on
the
theory
that
the
refund
was
inconsistent
with
the
earlier
deduction
and
the
tax
benefit
rule
therefore
required
the
recognition
of
income.
united
states
versus
bliss
dairy
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
this
case,
a
closely
held
dairy
purchased
cattle
feed
and
immediately
deducted
the
full
cost
as
an
expense
of
doing
business.
in
the
following
tax
year,
it
liquidated
and
distributed
the
unconsumed
feed
to
its
shareholders.
the
commissioner
included
in
the
dairy's
income,
the
amount
of
the
unconsumed
feed
again
on
the
theory
that
the
distribution
of
feed
was
inconsistent
with
the
earlier
deduction.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
taxpayer
has
argued
that
the
tax
benefit
rule
applies
to
require
the
recognition
of
income
only
if
there
is
a
physical
recovery
of
an
amount
previously
deducted.
the
commissioner
on
the
other
hand
has
taken
the
position
that
later
inconsistent
events
will
suffice
to
trigger
the
recognition
of
income.
we
hold
today
that
a
recovery
is
not
a
necessary
condition
for
the
recognition
of
income
under
the
tax
benefit
rule.
if
an
event
occurs
that
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
deduction
taken
earlier
in
the
sense
that
had
all
the
events
occurred
in
one
year,
the
deduction
would
have
been
denied.
the
tax
benefit
rule
requires
the
recognition
of
income.
however,
if
the
later
inconsistent
events
occurs
in
the
context
of
some
nonrecognition
rule
or
statute
such
as
the
rule
that
a
liquidating
corporation
does
not
recognize
income
in
the
distribution
of
its
assets
to
a
share
--
to
shareholders,
a
careful
examination
of
the
nonrecognition
rule
is
necessary
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
prevails
over
the
tax
benefit
rule.
our
examination
of
the
relevant
provisions
leads
us
to
conclude
in
hillsboro
that
the
petitioner
bank
need
not
recognize
income.
the
refund
of
the
taxes
to
the
shareholders
was
not
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
deduction
taken
by
the
banking
corporation.
bliss
dairy,
however,
must
recognize
income.
the
distribution
of
assets
to
its
shareholders
is
inconsistent
with
taking
a
deduction
for
the
business
consumption
of
those
assets.
although
the
distribution
occurred
in
the
context
of
the
nonrecognition
rule
of
section
336,
the
nonrecognition
rule
of
that
section
does
not
prevail
over
the
tax
benefit
rule.
