justice

powell,

mr.
solicitor
general,
before
you
go
on,
judge
pell
characterized
the
result
of
this
transaction
as
double
taxation.
that
is
certainly
different,
if
true,
from
the
classical
situation
where
a
bad
debt
is
charged
off
one
year
and
collected
the
following
year.
do
you
agree
that
the
result
for
which
you
contend
will
be
double
taxation?
the
bank
has
to
increase
its
taxes,
the
stockholders
also
have
to
pay
a
tax
on
what
they
received.

sir?

powell,

well,
that
could
be
why
this
case
is
different
from
the
established
and
rule
that
you
rely
on.
it
could
be.
