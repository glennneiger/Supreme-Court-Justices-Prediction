--if
that's
the
case,
if
it's
not...
well,
why
doesn't
the
government
simply
require
the
person
to
make
out
an
amended
return
for
the
later
year?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
probably
know
as
little
about
tax
law
as
i
do.
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general,
is
it
the
commissioner's
position
that
in
the
hypothetical
of
the
chief
justice
regarding
the
recovery
of
some
money
that
had
been
written
off
as
a
bad
debt,
it
would
be
treated
under
the
tax
benefit
rule
just
as
these
matters
have
been
treated
that
are
now
before
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
basically
depreciate
those
contracts,
don't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
try
hard
enough.
