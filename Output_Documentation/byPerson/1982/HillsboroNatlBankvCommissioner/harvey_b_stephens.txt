mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
mister
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
the
hillsboro
national
bank
case
is
simply,
should
payments
made
to
some
of
the
bank's
shareholders
by
a
third
party
be
included
in
the
bank's
income.
the
facts
underlying
this
case
are
these.
in
july
of
1971
the
hillsboro
national
bank
paid
the
personal
property
tax
for
all
of
its
shareholders,
all
149.
this
was
its
custom
for
a
number
of
years.
the
amount
of
the
tax
that
was
paid
was
$30,000
approximately.
it
was
paid
out
of
the
general
funds
of
the
bank.
in
the
subsequent
year,
in
its
1972
income
tax
return,
it
took
a
deduction
for
the
amount
of
the
tax
that
it
had
paid.
this
deduction
was
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
164(e)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
at
the
time
it
paid
the
tax
it
did
not
protest
the
payment
of
these
taxes,
as
was
provided
under
the
illinois
statute,
nor
at
any
time
thereafter
did
it
ever
contest
the
validity
of
the
personal
property
tax.
prior
to
the
time
of
the
payment
of
the
tax,
the
people
of
the
state
of
illinois
had
adopted
a
constitutional
amendment
that
stated
that
individuals
should
not
pay
ad
valorem
taxes
on
personal
property
owned
by
them.
this
constitutional
amendment
was
held
unconstitutional
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
july
of
1971.
consequently,
in
1971
personal
property
taxes
were
levied
against
individual
and
corporate
taxpayers.
hillsboro
national
bank
and
all
the
other
citizens
of
illinois
paid
a
personal
property
tax.
this
court
in
1973
reversed
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
lehnhausen
versus
lake
shore
auto
parts.
now
the
question
was
presented
to
all
the
county
treasurers
throughout
the
state:
what
do
they
do
with
the
money
that
was
paid
in
1972
for
the
1971
taxes?
the
illinois
general
assembly
had
attempted
to
solve
the
problem
by
passing
a
piece
of
special
legislation
which
specifically
referred
to
the
pending
case
in
this
court,
directed
the
county
treasurers
to
hold
the
money
in
escrow,
and
following
the
decision
in
this
court
to
either
dispense
the
money
to
the
taxing
bodies
or
to
refund
that
money
if
the
tax
was
declared
invalid.
this
special
act
was
enacted
after
the
hillsboro
national
bank
paid
the
tax.
it
was
not
on
the
books
and
did
not
exist
at
the
time
they
paid
the
tax.
some
time
during
1973
the
hillsboro
national
bank...
excuse
me,
the
montgomery
county
treasurer
decided
that
132
of
the
149
shareholders
of
the
bank
were
individuals
and
issued
refund
checks
of
the
amount
of
personal
property
tax
directly
to
the
shareholders.
they
did
not
consult
with
the
bank.
they
did
not
even
advise
the
bank
that
they
were
making
the
refunds
or
to
whom
or
how
they
were
made.
this
brings
us
to
the
issue
before
this
court.
very
simply,
should
these
refunds
to
the
132
shareholders
made
by
the
county
treasurer,
totaling
approximately
$26,000,
be
included
in
the
1973
income
of
the
hillsboro
national
bank.
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
no,
the
money
was
delivered
to
the
taxing
bodies
because
the
corporate
shareholders
were
held
to
be
liable
for
the
tax.
so
as
far
as
corporate
shareholders,
trusts,
executors,
they
made
up
the
other
17
shareholders
in
this
case.
we
are
faced
then
with
an
application
of
the
tax
benefit
rule.
the
tax
benefit
rule
is
a
judicially
created
doctrine
having
its
basis
in
equity
and
the
annual
accounting
principle.
prior
to
this
case,
a
case
before
it
in
the
seventh
circuit
called
first
trust,
and
a
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
of
tennessee-carolina,
all
of
the
cases
involving
the
tax
benefit
rule
had
three
elements
to
them:
first
of
all,
a
deduction;
secondly,
a
deduction
which
results
in
a
tax
benefit
to
the
taxpayers;
and
thirdly,
in
a
subsequent
year
there
is
an
economic
recovery
which
we
believe
has
the
effect
for
tax
purposes
of
increasing
the
net
worth.
the
commissioner
now
argues
in
this
court,
though,
that
this
third
requirement,
that
is
of
an
economic
recovery,
should
be
ignored
and
we
should
substitute
a
new
element,
a
rather
ambiguously
stated
argument,
and
i
quote
from
his
brief:
"the
premise
upon
which
deduction
was
taken
is
no
longer
valid.
"
in
order
to
get
to
that
result,
he
relies
on
three
earlier
opinions
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals.
each
one
of
these
cases,
there
is
an
economic
recovery.
the
first
case,
south
dakota
concrete,
involves
an
embezzlement
loss
and
a
deduction
for
it
in
year
one,
the
recovery
of
the
embezzlement
in
a
subsequent
year.
the
second
case,
block,
involves
a
deduction
on
an
income
tax
return
for
estate
taxes
that
were
paid,
federal
estate
taxes.
the
federal
estate
taxes
were
subsequently
refunded.
there
was
an
economic
recovery.
the
third
case
is
barnett.
it
involves
the
situation
where
a
person
leased
out
some
mineral
property,
they
took
a
depletion
allowance
against
the
advance
royalties.
for
tax
purposes
it
was
considered
that
the
property
had
been
expended.
the
property
was
returned
to
him,
the
lease
cancelled.
when
the
minerals
were
given
back
to
him,
they
also
received
back
the
depletion
allowance.
each
case,
there
is
an
economic
recovery.
in
this
case,
in
the
tax
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
they
relied
on
the
notion
that
the
taxpayer-shareholders,
through
some
sort
of
constructive
dividend
theory,
it
should
be
attributed
to
the
taxpayer.
however,
in
the
briefs
in
this
case
the
commissioner
now
takes
the
position
and
urges
that
even
if
no
one
had
received
a
recovery,
no
one,
the
court's
decision
in
lehnhausen
by
itself
required
the
inclusion
of
the
tax
payments
in
the
bank's
income.
that
means
quite
simply
that
if
the
county
treasurer
did
not
establish
the
escrow,
but
instead
immediately
distributed
all
the
funds
to
the
taxing
bodies
and
had
not
established
the
escrow,
so
that
there
was
no
money
to
be
refunded
and
no
money
was
refunded,
the
commissioner
now
argues
in
this
court
that
because
the
premise,
agreeably
and
concededly
valid,
on
which
the
deduction
was
taken
in
1972
has
become
invalid
by
subsequent
action,
that
you
must
restore
that
income.
this
is
contrary,
i
urge,
to
the
longstanding
history
of
the
tax
benefit
rule.
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
it
is
specifically
provided
for
under
section
164(e).
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
it's
a
statutory
provision
that
allows
corporations
to
pay
taxes
for
its
shareholders.
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
the
shareholders
are
precluded
from
treating
that
as
income
and
also
precluded
from
taking
a
deduction
for
the
tax.
it
was
passed
out
of
the
longstanding
history
going
back...
remember,
national
banks
can
only
be
taxed
in
certain
ways.
consequently,
one
of
the
ways
that
was
developed
early
on
was
the
idea
of
taxing
the
capital
stock,
and
therefore
the
internal
revenue
code
eventually,
after
some
cases
to
the
contrary,
was...
the
provision
of
164--
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
--it
was
treated
as
income
to
them.
that
is
not
specifically
in
the
record.
it
was
on
a
stipulation
of
facts.
but
that's
how
it
was
treated.
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
they
paid
tax
when
it
was
received,
yes,
sir.
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
in
order
for
the
tax
benefit
rule
to
apply,
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
two
different
years.
i
would
argue,
your
honor,
though,
it
makes
no
difference
if
it's
'72
or
'73,
because
the
bank
paid
out
the
money
on
the
basis
of
a
valid
premise,
they
have
received
nothing
bank
for
it,
their
books
have
not
been
adjusted.
and
so
i
would
say
that
if
this
court
had
ruled
in
december
of
'72,
before
the
corporate
tax
return
for
that
year
was
paid,
that
they
would
be
entitled
to
the
deduction,
because
there
had
been
no
recovery.
they
had
paid
the
money
out.
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
that
$800,000
is
taxable
to
the
jewelry
company
in
the
year
of
recovery
because,
as
your
honor
correctly
points
out
and
we
believe
is
relevant,
there
was
a
recovery,
an
economic
recovery
by
the
company.
it
wasn't
a
recovery
of
the
full
amount
of
the
diamonds
that
was
taken.
the
amount
that
would
be
included
in
the
tax
is
only
the
amount
of
the
recovery.
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
then
that
would
be
added
to
the
income,
because
again,
it
would
be
a
subsequent
recovery.
and
that,
in
point,
is
what
happened,
i
believe,
in
dodson
versus
u.s.
which
is
a
case
in
this
court,
earlier
applying
the
tax
benefit
rule.
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
the
premise
upon
which
the
82...
wait
a
minute.
in
the
82
return
is
when
we
got
the
$800,000.
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
okay.
the
premise
on
which
the
casualty
loss
deduction
was
taken
was
valid
in
that
year.
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
no--
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
--i
would
say
that
they
could
not,
because
the
recovery
occurred
in
83,
and
remember,
they
were
stolen.
that
premise
was
a
valid
premise
in
the
year--
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
--and
there
was
a
loss.
and
we
have
argued
here
that
the
tax
that
we
paid
for
our
shareholders
was
paid
in
1972.
and
in
response
to
justice
blackmun,
i
said
that
if
the
supreme
court
had
ruled
in
december
of
1972,
if
there
was
no
economic
recovery
to
us,
which
i
believe
that
there
was
not
because
our
balance
sheet
was
not
changed
in
any
way,
we
would
still
be
entitled
to
that
deduction.
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
i
believe
under
the
procedures
it
could,
but
this
is
not
the
proper--
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
--well,
obviously,
from
an
accounting
point
of
view
they
would
not
lose
the
case,
your
honor,
because
if
they
show
$1,800,000
deduction
and
an
$800,000
recovery,
they
only
have
a
million
dollar
loss.
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
well,
in
that
situation,--
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
--you're
saying
you're
distributing
the
diamonds.
i
would
think
what
you
mean,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
they
are
distributing
the
loss
that
incurred
or
the
right
for
the
insurance
recovery.
mr.
harvey
b.
stephens
physically
distributed
the
diamonds.
i
would
think
since
they
wouldn't
have
been
expensed
before,
they
would
not
apply,
and
the
diamonds
would
be
taken
to
the...
you
would
apply
the
tax
basis
that
would
be
apportioned
to
the
assets
it's
received.
there's
a
possible
capital
gain
and
loss
depending
upon
the
original
investment
of
the
shareholders
in
the
liquidation.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
commissioner
argues
that
recovery
is
irrelevant
but
in
every
case
except
the
tennessee-carolina,
and
in
our
case
here
and
in
first
trust,
there
was
recovery.
and
in
point
of
fact,
the
solicitor
has
said
oh,
we
can
find
recovery
here.
this
court,
in
commissioner
versus
first
security
bank
of
utah,
made
the
following
statement:
we
know
of
no
decision
of
this
court
wherein
a
person
has
been
found
to
be
taxed...
to
have
taxable
income
when
he
did
not
receive...
that
he
did
not
receive,
and
that
he
was
not
prohibited
from
receiving.
end
of
quote.
if
this
court
should
adopt
the
position
of
the
commissioner,
that
broad
statement
will
no
longer
be
true
because
no
income
has
been
received
by
the
hillsboro
national
bank.
they
paid
a
tax.
they
did
not
receiver
it.
in
first
trust,
the
checks...
a
small
distinction...
but
the
checks
were
made
payable
to
the
bank
and
the
shareholders.
the
bank
actually
had
to
endorse
the
checks.
the
lower
illinois
courts,
though,
in
keeping
with
the
commissioner
versus
first
security
bank,
held
that
the
bank
was
prohibited
from
receiving
the
refunds.
i
urge
that
this
court
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit.
thank
you
for
your
courtesy.
