we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
hillsboro
national
bank
against
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
and
the
consolidated
case.
mister
stephens,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
silhasek.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
got
the
benefit
when
the
corporation
was
liquidated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
had
this
second
event
not
occurred,
would
the
stockholders
have
received
more
or
less?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
put
the
question
another
way.
would
the
treatment
of
the
stockholders
have
been
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
the
tax
benefit
rule
shouldn't
apply
because
there
was
no
benefit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
benefit
to
the
tax...
to
the
stockholders?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
silhasek.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
apply,
mr.
solicitor
general,
if
let
us
say
a
tax
had
been
paid
and
that
had
been
deducted,
and
then
later
there
was
a
recovery,
a
refund
on
that
tax
paid.
then
that
refund
becomes
income--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--a
subsequent
year.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
element--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
something
that's
at
least
simple
to
me.
in
1972
we'll
say
$100,000
was
allowed
as
a
write-off
for
bad
debts,
uncollectable.
then
through
some
circumstance
someone,
even
if
he
has
no
longer
a
legal
obligation
to
pay
because
of
a
statute
of
limitation,
pays
the
debt
in
a
subsequent
taxable
year.
that
invokes
the
rule,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
that
different
from
what
we're
dealing
with
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
stephens,
let
me
put
this
question
to
you.
a
jewelry
company
sends
a
courier
periodically
to
israel
to
the
diamond
market.
and
he
buys
a
million
dollars
worth
of
diamonds;
each
diamond
in
a
packet
is
appraised
with
the
price
on
it.
on
the
way
back,
the
courier
is
kidnapped
and
the
jewels
stolen
in
1982,
this
year.
next
year,
the
police,
interpol
and
whatnot,
apprehend
the
thief
and
he's
got
$800,000
of
the
diamonds
left
and
the
$800,000
comes
back.
what
about
that?
what
do
you
say
is
the
status
of
that
$800,000
recovery?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
let
me
change
it
a
little
bit.
in
1982
no
settlement
is
made
with
the
insurance
company.
in
83,
the
insurance
companies
pays
a
million
dollars
to
the
company
for
its
loss.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
tell
you
my
hypothetical
one
step
beyond.
in
83,
perhaps
from
the
shock
of
this
loss,
the
principal
officers
decide
to
liquidate
the
corporation.
they
have
eight
stockholders.
they
distribute
$100,000
worth
of
diamonds
to
each
one
of
the
stockholders
along
with
whatever
other
assets
are
liquidated.
what
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
how
is
that
different
from
the
feed,
except
that
you
can't
eat
the
diamonds.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
mean
physically.
a
packet
full
of
diamonds.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
hear
arguments
next.
