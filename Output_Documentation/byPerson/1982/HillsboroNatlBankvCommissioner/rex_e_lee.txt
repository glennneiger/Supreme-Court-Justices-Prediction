mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
no
one
in
these
cases
is
contesting
the
tax
benefit
rule
as
a
general
principle
necessary
to
our
federal
income
tax
system,
based
as
it
is
upon
annual
accounting.
the
only
issue
is
what
type
of
event
serves
to
trigger
the
rule.
the
answer
to
that
question,
we
submit,
is
supplied
by
an
examination
of
the
purpose
of
the
rule.
the
triggering
event
ought
to
be
key
to
the
reason
why
we
have
a
tax
benefit
rule.
simply
put,
the
tax
benefit
rule
requires
a
taxpayer
to
include
in
income
the
amount
of
deduction
taken
for
costs
and
expenditures
that
are
ultimately
not
incurred.
in
a
tax
system
based
on--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--in
a
later
year,
in
a
later
year.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
offsets
what
happened
during
the
earlier
year.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
precisely.
and
it
is
not
that
it
is
income
because
of
the
recovery.
it
is
rather
that
it
disproves
the
earlier
event,
it
shows
that
the
earlier
deduction
that
was
taken
by
the
taxpayer.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
asked
exactly
that
same
question.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but
i
have
the
answer
from
those
who
know
more
than
either
of
us,
and
the
answer
is
that
the
government
cannot
require
an
amended
return.
and
the
other
answer
is
that
in
some
instances--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
but
what
it
does
is
to
require
the
correction
at
a
later
point
in
time.
and
in
addition,
there
are
some
instances
where
it
is
not
in
fact
income.
for
example,
assume
in
the
bliss
dairy
case
that
what
bliss
dairy
had
done
was
to
expend
$150,000
for
feed
and
then
had
simply
given
some
of
it
to
the
president
of
the
corporation
or
to
his
brother-in-law
to
use
for
their
personal
purposes,
to
feed
their
personal
cattle.
that
would
not
have
been
income
to
anyone
and
yet
it
would
have
been
shown
at
that
point
in
time
that
it
was
an
expense
that
was
not
in
fact
an
expense
of
that
corporation
for
cattle
feed
purposes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
reason
is,
and
this
goes,
justice
blackmun,
right
to
the
heart
of
the
tax
benefit
rule,
the
problem
is
the
annual
accounting
concept
that
was
declared
in
1931
by
this
court
in
sanford
&
burnett
against
brooks,
the
notion
that
we
do
not
assess
tax
on
the
basis
of
a
transactional
approach
and
wait
until
all
of
the
assets
of
the
transaction
have
been
finally
completed.
rather,
at
the
end
of
each
year
we
determine,
what
are
the
income,
what
have
been
the
expenses,
and
then
assess
the
tax
within
that
year.
in
some
instances,
however,
it
later
develops
that
deductions
that
were
taken
because
of
later
events
we
know
were
not
in
fact
deductions
to
that
taxpayer.
if
they
occur
within
the
same
year,
then
both
transactions
are
a
wash.
the
later
event
simply
nets
out
the
former.
the
problem
arises
when
you
have
a
circumstance
where
the
later
event
occurs
in
a
subsequent
year,
and
that's
where
the
tax
benefit
rule--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
in
some
instances,
as
i
indicated...
in
some
instances,
i
suppose
that
that
would
solve
the
problem.
in
other
instances,
there
is
not
an
income
item
that
occurs
in
the
later
year.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
that
is
correct,
and
that
what
is
the
primary
purpose
is
determining...
but
because
of
the
annual
accounting
concept,
there
are
these
later
balancing
entries
or
correcting
entries
that
may
from
time
to
time
be
necessary.
now,
in
the
great
majority
of
instances
it
is
true
that
there
will
in
fact
be
a
recovery,
and
the
later
disproving
event
is
in
most
instances
accompanied
by
a
recovery.
but
that
is
purely
fortuitous
where
it
occurs,
because
the
recovery
itself
is
really
irrelevant
to
the
reason
that
we
have
a
tax
benefit
rule.
the
reason
that
we
have
the
rule
is
in
order
to
prevent
the
distortion
that
would
otherwise
result,
justice
blackmun,
just
as
you
have
stated,
from
the
application
of
the
annual
accounting
principle.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
the
earlier
period.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
the
earlier
period.
that
is
not
the
way
that
the
tax
benefit
rule
has
developed.
in
fact,
it
achieves
roughly
the
same
result
that
would
have
occurred
if
the
two
events
had
fallen
out
in
the
same
year.
there
are
some
differences.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
it
is
not
always
exactly
the
same.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
it
would
in
fact...
alice
phelan
sullivan
corporation,
for
example,
is
one
instance
where
there
is
a
difference
because
of
a
different
tax
rate.
but
the
way
the
rule
has
developed
is
that
what
we
do
is
we
come
to
an
end,
we
bring
an
end
to
each
tax
accounting
period
and
then
it
back
into
income
in
the
later
period.
but
the
crucial
event...
or
the
crucial
question
here
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
is
income,
in
the
later
period.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--to
recover
a
deduction,
but
we
do
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that's
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
we
do
that
by
including
in
income
in
the
later
period
the
amount
of
the
deduction
that
we
now
know
was
improperly
taken
in
the
earlier
period.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
if
it
were
feasible,
the
government
could
require
that
we
go
back
and
reopen
the
period.
then
it
could
be
done
in
that
way.
in
fact,
that
is
not
the
way
the
tax
benefit
rule--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
they
do,
justice
blackmun,
in
the
sense
of
going
back
and
requiring
an
audit.
but
this
is
not
the
same
circumstance,
according
to
tax
procedure
as
i
understand
it,
as
regards
this
kind
of
situation,
because
all
accounts
are
closed
as
of
12/31,
or
whenever
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
that's
right.
but
subject
only
to
an
audit.
it's
not
that
we
are
contending
that
there
was
anything
improper
that
happened
in
1972.
as
of
the
end
of
1972,
any
event
that
occurred
in
1972
as
to
hillsboro
was
proper.
it's
only
that
in
subsequent
years,
because
of
events
that
occurred
in
subsequent
years,
we
now
know
that
the
deduction
was
not
proper.
now,
let's
take
the
hillsboro
facts
and
i
think
it
may
help
to
clarify
just
a
bit.
i
assume
that
no
one
would
quarrel
with
the
proposition
that
if
all
the
events
had
occurred
in
1972
the
bank
would
not
have
been
able
to
claim
a
deduction
for
state
tax.
the
bank
would
have
paid
the
money
into
the
state
treasury
in
'72
and
the
state
would
have
paid
it
back
to
the
shareholders.
the
dividend
character
of
the
three-cornered
transaction
is
apparent
and
it
is
well
established
that
dividend
distributions
are
not
deductible.
the
fact
that
the
two
events
occurred
in
separate
years
should
not
lead
to
a
different
result.
in
either
case,
we
now
know
what
we
did
not
know
in
1972,
and
that
is
that
this
is
not
something
that
the
bank
owes
and
it
is
not
a
deductible
item.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
but
it
is...
all
right.
we
now
know
what
we
didn't
know
earlier,
and
that
is
that
it
is
something
that
no
one
owes.
it
is
simply
not
a
deductible
item,
not
something
for
whose
payment
the
bank
is
entitled
to
a
deduction.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
invokes
the
tax
benefit
rule.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
not
different
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
not
at
all.
now,
my
friends
to
my
left
will
tell
you
that
it
is
different
because
it
involves
a
recovery.
and
my
comment
is
that
a
recovery
is
totally...
i
cannot
think
of
a
more
irrelevant
criterion
for
the
reason
that
we
have
the
tax
benefit
rule
than
whether
there
has
or
has
not
in
fact
been
a
recovery.
because
what
we're
looking
for
is
whether
we
now
know
in
a
later
period,
period
two,
three,
four
or
26,
something
that
we
didn't
know
in
the
earlier
period
which
indicates
that
in
fact,
subject
to
sections
164
and
461,
the
bank
was
not
entitled
to
a
deduction
for
that
expenditure.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
now,
there
would
be
a
claim,
of
course.
but
the
fact
is,
the
crucial
criterion
is,
is
there
a
later
disproving
event.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
let's
turn
to
the
dairy
case--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--clearly,
it's
double
taxation,
just
like
dividends
are
always
double
taxation.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
just
like
dividends
are
always
double
taxation.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
double
taxation
only
in
this
sense--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
it
is
not
double
taxation
in
this
sense.
the
bank
in
1972
took
a
deduction
for
an
expenditure
it
was
ultimately
determined
no
one
owed.
at
the
time...
the
triggering
event
that
determined
that
it
was
no
owed
was
the
return
of
the
money
to
the
shareholders.
the
shareholders
include
that
within
their
taxable
income
and
the
bank,
under
the
tax
benefit
rule,
includes
the
amount
of
the
earlier
deduction
within
its
taxable
income.
so
that
it's
only
double
taxation
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
tax
on
the
shareholders
and
there
is
also
a
tax
on
the
bank.
but
that
would
also
be
true
in
the
event
that
the
bank
simply
declared
a
dividend
on
its
earnings
and
profits.
now,
let
me
turn
to
justice--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
not
really,
because
in
that
circumstance
it
is
not
permission
to
distribute
funds
from
the
corporation
to
the
shareholders
which
they
can
then
use
for
their
purposes.
but
if
you
regard
that
as
a
deductible
dividend,
then
that
is
one
statutory
exemption
to
the
general
rule,
applicable
only
to
that
circumstance.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
for
the
reason
stated.
we
now
know
what
we
did
not
know
earlier,
that
it
was
not
a
proper
deduction,
and
the
shareholders
would
then
have
a
claim
against
whoever
had
stolen
them.
but
the
tax
benefit
rule
still
operates.
now,
let
me
return
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
bliss
dairy.
bliss
purchased
approximately
$150,000
worth
of
cattle
feed
and
claimed
a
deduction
for
the
full
$150,000,
on
the
assumption
that
the
entire
amount
of
feed
would
be
consumed
in
its
business.
in
fact,
it
was
not.
the
reason
was,
bliss
used
only
$94,000
worth
of
the
feed
in
its
business
because
it
went
out
of
business
before
it
used
all
the
feed.
we
now
know
what
we
did
not
know
at
the
end
of
fiscal
1973,
and
that
is
that
bliss'
feed
expense,
bliss
as
a
corporation,
feed
expense
for
1973
was
not
$150,000,
it
was
$94,000.
now,
i
need
to
make
two
points.
the
first
is,
mr.
silhasek
is
right
when
he
says
that
there
was
an
allocation
of
the
basis,
the
shareholders'
basis
in
their
stock,
among
the
various
assets.
i
know
of
no
indication
in
this
record
as
to
how
much
of
that
basis
went
to
the
feed,
though
that
i
think
is
immaterial.
the
crucial
point,
the
first
aspect
of
my
response,
is
that
insofar
as
the
feed
itself
is
concerned
there
was
a
stepped-up
basis
and
that
is
undeniable.
insofar
as
the
feed
is
concerned,
the
corporation
paid
for
it
once
and
the
corporation
and
the
shareholders
deducted
it
twice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
and
that's
my
second
point.
but
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
in
the
usual
instance
there
will
in
fact
be
a
double
benefit
because
of
the
fact
that
you
do
get
a
stepped
up
basis
in
the
feed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
don't
know
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
if
there
is
a
fair
market
value
of
the
feed
at
the
time
of
distribution
there
will
be
some
allocation
that
will
be
made
to
the
expensed
items.
but
simple
because...
you
allocate
the
basis,
and
if
the
stock
is
zero
then
you're
right,
there
is
none.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
then
they
would--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
but
in
any
event,
the
crucial
point
is
that
we
now
know
what
we
did
not
know
before,
and
that
is
that
the
corporation
did
not
use
this
as
an
expensed
deduction
in
the
amount
of
$155,000,
but
the
feed
expense
was
in
fact
only
$94,000.
now
i
come
to
the
common
argument
that
both
of
the
taxpayers
have
against
the
application
of
the
tax
benefit
rule,
and
it
is
that
the
tax
benefit
rule
should
be
key
to
recovery.
quite
frankly,
i
can
think
of
nothing
that
would
be
more
irrelevant
to
the
reason
that
we
have
a
tax
benefit
rule
than
whether
there
has
or
has
not
been
a
recovery.
as
the
seventh
circuit
observed
in
the
first
trust
case,
what
is
required
is
either
a
recovery
or
some
other
event
that
disproves
the
earlier
assumption.
neither
counsel
in
this
case
nor
the
ninth
circuit
nor
anyone
else
has
been
able
to
suggest
any
possible
bearing
that
recovery
or
nonrecovery
has
on
the
underlying
objective
of
the
tax
benefit
rule.
bliss
has
a
second
argument
and
it's
based
on
section
335,
and
i
want
to
turn
to
that
now.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
because
i
think
what
they
have
done
is
they
have
purchased
his
services
for
however
long
he
lives.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
would
regard
that...
i'm
not
sure
how
that
would
come
out,
but
i
would
argue
that
that
is
a
purchase
of
his
services
for
as
long
as
he
lives,
and
that
it
would
not--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--your
question
correctly
shows--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--your
question
shows
that
you
understand
what
we're
saying.
i
would
apply
it
differently
in
that
kind
of
circumstance,
but
it
would
be
arguably
applicable
to
that
kind
of
circumstance.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
because
you
could
say
that
what
they
had
purchased
was
not
his
services
for
five
years,
that
it
was
his
services
for
five
years
or
whenever
he
dies
or
becomes
incapacitated,
whichever
comes
first.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
except
there
may
be
slightly
different
assumptions
in
the
case
of
feed
and
the
case
of
football
players.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
may
well
be.
certainly
i
would
not
be
embarrassed
to
defend
the
commissioner
in
this
court
under--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
i'm
just
not
sure.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
they
do.
i
think
they
do,
in
which
case
it
may
not
be
the
best
example
for
this
circumstance.
but
let
me
get
to
the
336
argument.
bliss'
argument
is
that
once
it
decided
to
terminate
its
business
it
distributed
all
of
its
assets,
including
the
unconsumed
feed,
to
its
shareholders
in
a
liquidating
transaction
governed
by
section
336
of
the
code,
which
provides
that
no
gain
or
loss
shall
be
recognized
to
a
corporation
on
the
distribution
of
property
in
partial
or
complete
liquidation.
and
bliss'
argument
is
that
this
statute
precludes
the
application
of
the
tax
benefit
rule.
the
fallacy
in
that
argument
is
that
the
gain
which
section
336
immunizes
is
a
gain
from
the
sale
of
appreciated
assets
and,
for
reasons
that
are
spelled
out
more
fully
in
our
reply
brief,
particularly
the
reference
to
the
first
bank
of
stratford
case
in
connection
with
the
adoption
of
the
companion
provision
to
section
336,
section
311,
makes
very
clear
that
that's
the
kind
of
gain
to
which
section
336
applies.
this
is
also
borne
out
by,
interestingly
enough,
a
ninth
circuit
case,
the
west
seattle
case.
the
amount
which
the
commissioner
seeks
to
include
in
bliss'
income
does
not
result
from
the
disposition
of
an
appreciated
asset.
it
was
not
a
gain
in
the
section
336
meaning
of
that
word.
on
the
contrary,
the
income
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
ordinary
business
income
of
bliss'
prior
taxable
period
that
had
gone
untaxed
as
a
result
of
the
offset
provided
by
bliss'
cattle
feed
deduction,
a
deduction
that
was
based
on
anticipated
expense
that
bliss
in
fact
never
incurred.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
to
the
same
extent,
justice
o'connor,
the
literal
language
also
applies
to
the
companion
provision
of
section
336,
which
is
section--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--a
rather
consistent
judge-made
exception--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
uniform,
well
accepted.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
that's
right.
we
have
been,
i
submit,
justice
white,
in
answer
to
your
question,
consistent
in
this
position.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
this
is
an
administrative
interpretation.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
but
more
than
that,
we
also
have
two
companion
provisions,
sections
336
and
337.
the
sole
purpose,
as
i
think
every
tax
lawyer
acknowledges,
for
the
adoption
of
section
337
was
to
prevent
inconsistencies
that
would
otherwise
come
into
transactions
that
are
governed
by
sections
336
and
337,
that
is
those
in
which
pursuant
to
a
corporate
liquidation
the
sale
of
assets
is
made
either
by
the
corporation
or
by
the
shareholders.
it
was
to
eliminate
that
inconsistency
that
section
337
was
adopted.
it
is
well
settled
that,
notwithstanding
the
clear
no-gain
language
of
section
337,
the
tax
benefit
law
applies.
if
bliss
dairy
were
to
win
this
case,
so
that
the
tax
benefit
rule
were
not
applicable
to
section
336
provisions...
transactions...
but
were
applicable
to
section
337
provisions,
a
close
relative,
indeed
arguably
the
same
kind
of
inconsistency
that
congress
sought
to
eliminate
through
its
passage
of
section
337,
would
creep
back
in
under
the
guise
of
the
inconsistent
application
of
the
tax
benefit
rule.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
do
not
understand
our
position
to
be
that
this
has
anything
to
do
with
a
stepped-up
basis
on
estate
taxes,
estate
tax
cases.
this
is
strictly
in
income
tax
matters.
that
is
governed
by
statute
and
it's
governed
by
a
statute
that
does
not
have
the
limited
interpretation
of
the
word
336
does
by
virtue
of
its--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--if
it
were
applied
to
donors'
property
or
decedents'
estates,
which
so
far
as
i
know
the
commissioner
has
never
urged.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but
let
me
tell
you
about--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
there
is
nothing
in
nash
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
we're
taking.
in
nash
the
court
rejected
the
government's
argument
that
when
a
partnership
incorporates
the
amount
of
its
reserve
for
bad
debts
should
be
included
in
income.
in
nash
there
was
no
later
inconsistent
event,
no
disproof
of
the
earlier
assumption.
the
fact
of
incorporation
proved
nothing
about
the
collectability
or
noncollectability
of
the
existing
accounts
receivable
in
the
portfolio
of
the
partnership,
and
as
a
consequence
it
simply
showed
nothing
about
the
earlier
collectability.
and
indeed,
one
of
the
concerns
in
nash
was
the
possibility
of
the
double
deduction,
which
was
also
the
concern
of
the
tennessee-carolina
court
in
the
sixth
circuit,
and
there
is
at
least
the
possibility
of
such
in
the
bliss
dairy
kind
of
circumstance.
now,
finally,
if
recovery
is
essential
we
still
are
entitled
to
win.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
but
i
think
the
assumption,
justice
stevens,
is
not
the
assumption
that
the
corporation
would
continue;
the
assumption
is
about
the
collectability
of
the
debts.
and
there
is
nothing
about
that
assumption--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
simply
take
a
different
view
as
to
what
the
relevant
assumption
is.
if
recovery
is
required,
there
is
recovery
in
both
of
these
cases.
this
case
is
identical
to
tennessee-carolina.
there
is
no
basis
for
distinguishing
the
two,
that
is,
bliss
dairy.
and
in
tennessee-carolina
the
sixth
circuit
did
hold
that
there
was
a
recovery.
and
indeed,
in
circumstances
that
i
think
are
indistinguishable,
the
first
trust
case
held
that
there
was
a
recovery
in
the
hillsboro
type
of
situation,
and
the
tax
court
in
hillsboro
itself
held
that
there
is
a
recovery.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
recovery
is
a
recovery
to
the
shareholders,
who
in
turn
own
the
bank.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
it
is
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
and
that
was
precisely
the
rationale
in
tennesee-carolina.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
that
is
not
our
preferred
view
of
the
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
that's
why
i
say
it
is
not--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
can
find
a
recovery.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
if
you
try
hard
enough.
[laughter]
and
the
tax
court
did
find
a
recovery
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
but
tying
the
rule
to
recovery
leads
you
to
try
very
hard,
as
did
the
tax
court
and
as
did
tennesse-carolina.
much
better
is
to
key
it
not
to
recovery,
which
is
irrelevant
to
the
purpose
of
the
tax
benefit
rule,
but
rather,
to
the
question
of
whether
in
fact
the
benefit
was
not
taken.
and
for
this
reason,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
reversed,
and
the
seventh
circuit.
