justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
exemption...
is
the
amount
that's
involved...
isn't
the
exemption
limited
to
$200?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
household
goods?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
each
item.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
bankrupt
should
never
worry
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it's
true,
if
he...
all
he'd
have
to
know
is
what
congress'
finding
was,
that
there
was
no
interest
in
repossessing.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
think
that
there
are
repossessions
in--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
enough
cases
to
make
the
threat
real.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
not
only
that
but
they
repossess
them
when
their
debt
isn't
very
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
collect
their
$600
by
repossessing
the
household
goods,
and
they
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he...
excuse
me.
he
would
use
his...
he
would
use
his...
he
uses
the
section.
if
he
gets
$200
back,
he
uses
the
section,
because
the
lien
then
is
removed
from
the
$200.
justice
byron
r.
white
provided
he...
or
if
they
repossess
a
television
set,
the
lien
would
give
them
the
$500
if
it's
worth
$500.
but
he--
justice
byron
r.
white
--exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
reduces
it
by
enough
to
get
it
down
to
$200.
it
protects
$200
worth
of
interest
in
the
television
set.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
whether
self-help
was
allowed
or
did
they
have
to
foreclose
these
liens
if
they
wanted
through
court?
can't
they
just
go
and
repossess?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
go
and
repossess.
they
drive
up
to
the
house
and
take
the
goods.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under
the
laws
of
both
states
that
is
permissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
government's
position
just
isn't
threats
or
overreaching
or
anything.
it's
saying
that
whatever
interest
a
creditor
has
is
de
minimis
in
the
property;
that
it's
just
not
a
reality.
they
have
a
lien,
but
it's
a
paper
lien.
it's
just
not
worth
anything.
at
least
it
can't
be
worth
enough
to
be
called
a
taking.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just...
it's
just...
has
no
substance.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
congress...
if
congress
viewed
that...
took
that
view
about
these
kinds
of
liens
for
the
future,
it
certainly
was
a
considerate
judgment
that
these
kinds
of
liens
aren't
worth
very
much,
because
they
certainly
didn't
do
it
as
to
mortgages
on
real
estate.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
be
a
voiding
of
the
lien.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the...
what
about
the
suggestion,
though,
of
the
government
and
apparently
of
congress
that
there's
hardly
ever
a
repossession,
and
hence,
the
property
interest
is
just
de
minimis?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
congressional
judgment
is
infirm,
that
there's
hardly
ever
a
repossession
on
this
kind
of
a
lien,
and
hence,
it's
of
negligible
value?
is
that
judgment
just
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
fine.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know.
i
think
it...
i
think
that...
that
it
is
before
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
agree
that
you're
entitled
to
win
even
if
the
congress
is
quite
right
just
because
you
have
a
property
interest,
pure
and
simple,
whether
you
use
it
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
lien
is
valid
under
state
law--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
you
don't
need
any...
if
this
provision
is
invalid,
it
is
just
invalid,
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--why
do
you
need
the
prior
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
need
the
old
act.
all
you
need
is
to
eliminate
the
law
that
invalidates
your
lien.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
care
whether
they
apply
a
bankruptcy
law
or
not.
you
hope
they
don't.
all
you
want's
your
lien.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
would
have
to
have
some
authorization
under
the
bankruptcy
statute
to
invalidate
your
lien,
which
you
wouldn't
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
really
just
saying
the
lien
isn't
worth
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
--eastman
and
loretto
or
not?
the
lien
isn't
worth
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
not
a
lien?
a
chattel
mortgage
isn't
a
traditional
form
of
a
lien?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
suppose...
congress
couldn't
really
have
thought
that
there
never
was
a...
never
was
a
repossession
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
maybe
out
of
a
hundred
you
would
say...
ten
out
of
a
hundred,
one
out
of
ten,
that
is
probably
a
repossession.
then
congress
thought
well,
that's
not
enough
for
the
future.
but
it
took
care
for
the
past
of
all
of
them,
not
only
the
nine,
but
the
one
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
the
only
use
of
the
lien
in
every
single
case.
it
just
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so
for
the
future.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you.
