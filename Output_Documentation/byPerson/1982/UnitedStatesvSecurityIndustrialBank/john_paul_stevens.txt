justice
john
paul
stevens
it
isn't
right
that
the
good
has
a
value
of
less
than
$200,
just
that
the
interest
involved
is
only
to
the
extent
of
$200.
you
could
have
a
$500
refrigerator,
but
the
exemption
would
only
cover
$200.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he'd
just
get
$200
out
of
the
proceeds
of
resale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
isn't
quite
correct
to
say
that
all
these
property
rights
were
destroyed
as
of
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
it
only
affects
people
who
go
bankrupt
after
the
statute
was
passed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed
no
rights
were
immediately
affected
by
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you're
right.
but
just
assume
the
statute
is
valid.
it
still
didn't
of
its
own
force
invalidate
any
contractual
relationships.
it
took
a
subsequent
act
of
bankruptcy,
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
only
applies
to
those
debtors
who
go
bankrupt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
could
have
changed
the
order
of
priority...
i
don't
know
what
the
order
of
priority
was...
to
make
these
junior
to
some
claims
to
which
they
were
previously
senior
in
the
future?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
what
they've
done
here
really,
it
says
they'll
be
treated
like
general
creditors
is
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you
say
they
couldn't
even
rearrange
the
order
of
priority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
they
just
said
in
the
new
act
these
claims
will
be
junior
to
wage
claims...
previously
it
was
the
other
way
around;
i
don't
know
whether
that's
true
or
not...
would
that
be
a
taking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
result
in
a
diminution
of
the
value
of
your
lien.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
take
any
change
in
the
order
of
priority
it
would
violate
the
terms.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
would
have
had
jurisdiction,
wouldn't
it,
to
invalidate
your
lien
on
some
entirely
different
theory
such
as
unconscionability
or
something
or
other...
you
didn't
sign
the
papers
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
kind
of
issue,
you
are
saying,
would
be
adjudicated
under
the
old
act
rather
than
the
new
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you,
supposing
a
state
passed
a
statute
that
invalidated
liens
like
this
retroactively.
would
that
be
valid,
in
your
judgment,
to
say
we
will
no
longer
hold
this
kind
of
lien
to
be
enforceable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
such
a
state
law
would
be
invalid
under
the
contract
laws?
