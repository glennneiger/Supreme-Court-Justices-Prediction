much
like
the
fraser-lempke
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
may
make
it
a
poor
loan,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
people
might
not
want
to
foreclose
the
security
and
get
what
they
could
out
of
it,
even
though
it
doesn't
pay
off
the
debt.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
a
debtor
who
has
given
a
chattel
mortgage
on
his
personal
property
the
way
it
happened
here
is
no
different
than
a
debtor
who
simply
is
given
an
unsecured
obligation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
there
is...
there
is
a
property
interest
created
under
the
laws
of
most
states
by
that
sort
of
security.
and
for
you
to
say
that
there
isn't
really
any
just
begs
the
question.
there
certainly
is
an
interest.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
congress
can't
legislate
the
way
a
state
legislature
could
in
the
very
broad
context.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
just
dealing
with
bankruptcy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
when
congress
first
introduced
the
four-month
preference
period
into
the
bankruptcy
act...
was
it
the
act
of
1898?
when
a
property
interest
perfectly
good
under
state
law
was
voidable
in
bankruptcy
if
it
was
incurred
within
four
months
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
now,
that,
i
suppose,
is
an
impairment
to
a
certain
extent
of
that
property.
is
there
any
reason
why
congress
can't
apply
that
retroactively?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
wasn't?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
only
prospectively.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
field,
if
the
auffm'ordt
case,
which
you
mentioned
or
implied
by
a
question
i
asked,
is
rightly
decided,
that
sounds
like
it's
fairly
good
precedent
for
saying
that
an
act
like
this
applies
only
prospectively,
and
that
you
pick
out
simply
a
section
of
the
act
that
may
raise
these
kind
of
problems
and
say
it
applies
only
prospectively.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
make
that
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
really
cover
it
in
your
brief.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
kind
of
claim,
whether
or
not
a
debtor
is
entitled
to
an
exemption,
is
something
that
could
have
been
clearly
decided
by
an
old-fashioned
referee.
it
certainly
wouldn't
take
an
article
iii
judge
to
decide
this
kind
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
read
a
lot
more
into
the
northern
pipeline
case
decision
than
i
would
have.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these,
of
course...
these
cases
were
all
decided
before
the
northern
pipeline
case.
doesn't
the
case
of
chico
valley
drainage
district,
decided
after
the
holding
that
the
municipal
bankruptcy
act
was
unconstitutional,
say
that
the
fact
that
the
law
was
unconstitutional
doesn't
mean
that
nothing
happens
as
a
result
of
adjudications
made
under
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
the
doctrine
of
dependent
relative
revocation
at
will,
isn't
it...
that
this
bankruptcy
act
was
no
good.
the
repeal
of
the
old
one
wasn't
any
good.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
a
non-possessor
of
property
interest
originated
about
the
16th
century,
didn't
it,
in
personal
property?
i
mean,
that's
no
brand
new
type
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
a
group
of
people
in
kansas
and
colorado
have
borrowed
money
from
several
loan
companies
before
in
november
1978
and
each
of
these
individuals
gave
the
loan
company
a
lien
on
household
furnishings
and
appliances
as
security
for
the
debt.
in
november
1978,
congress
passed
a
new
bankruptcy
law.
one
provision
of
this
permits
individuals
who
become
bankrupt
to
avoid
some
liens
on
household
furnishings
and
appliances.
some
time
after
the
new
law
became
effective,
each
of
these
individual
borrowers,
in
our
case,
filed
for
bankruptcy
and
the
bankruptcy
courts
in
kansas
and
colorado
each
claimed
the
new
law
entitled
them
to
keep
the
household
goods
notwithstanding
the
lien.
each
of
the
loan
companies
protested,
it
would
unconstitutional
to
apply
this
law
to
them.
they
relied
on
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
which
forbids
the
government
to
take
private
property
for
public
use
without
just
compensation.
united
states
government
appeared
on
behalf
of
the
individuals
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
in
each
case,
the
bankruptcy
courts
in
kansas
and
colorado
ruled
for
the
loan
company.
the
government
appealed
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
agreed
with
the
loan
companies
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
although
they
agreed
with
the
government
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
apply
to
these
transactions
which
occurred
before
the
date
the
statute
was
enacted.
we
have
decided
we
not
--
need
not
decide
whether
these
laws
unconstitutional
because
we
determined
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
statute
to
apply
to
liens
that
were
created
before
it
was
enacted.
in
the
rather
early
case
of
holt
against
henley
decided
in
1914,
this
court
established
the
principle
of
construction
that
no
bankruptcy
law
shall
be
interpreted
to
destroy
property
rights
that
were
created
before
the
law
was
enacted
unless
congress
is
explicitly
required
the
contrary.
in
this
case,
an
early
draft
of
the
1978
statute
contained
this
sort
of
explicit
statement
but
congress
removed
it
before
it
passed
the
law.
therefore,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
under
which
the
loan
companies
were
entitled
to
obtain
their
liens.
justice
blackmun
joined
by
justice
brennan
and
justice
marshall
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
