mr.
henry
f.
field
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
have
two
grounds
that
we
are
presenting
today
upon
which
we
believe
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed,
and
i'd
like
to
discuss
them
in
turn.
the
first
ground
is
that
the
1978
bankruptcy
act
may
not
be
applied
in
this
situation
because
of
its
unconstitutionality,
because
of
the
integral
nature
of
the
judiciary
provisions
which
have
been
held
unconstitutional
already.
i
will
address
that
after
we
first
respond
to
the
government
with
respect
to
the
retroactive
application
of
522(f).
as
this
court
noted
in
the
questionings
of
the
government,
the
real
vice
here
is
not
whether
congress
can
decide
for
the
future
that
the
policy
of
the
federal
government
in
bankruptcy
will
be
that
certain
kinds
of
interests
are
or
are
not
protectable.
the
question
is
whether
congress
or
committees
of
congress
or
testimony
before
congress
can
be
used
to
decide
whether
the
transaction
in
existence
at
that
time
between
a
and
b
is
in
fact
void
because
unconscionable,
because
a
subject
of
overreaching,
because
the
interest
was
only
used
for
threat
purposes,
et
cetera...
whatever
the
justifications
are.
the
real
vice
in
this
statute
is
that
it
usurps
the
judicial
function
of
deciding
cases
between
existing
parties
and
decides
as
a
matter
of
legislative
policy,
at
least
as
interpreted
by
the
solicitor
general,
that
a's
contract
with
b
was
unconscionable.
now,
in
the
record
of
this
case
before
this
court
there's
not
a
trace
of
suggestion
that
these
transactions
are
in
fact
unconscionable,
the
subject
of
overreaching,
the
property
is
held
by
these
creditors
only
for
threat
purposes,
et
cetera.
i
think
each
of
these
justifications
would
be,
as
we
pointed
out,
true...
at
least
the
threat
justification...
true
with
respect
to
all
creditors.
as
justice
o'connor
has
pointed
out,
there
is
no
difference.
and
the
principle
upon
which
the
government
is
urging
this
court
to
destroy
or
permit
the
destruction
retroactively
of
vested
property
rights
admits
of
no
real
distinction
between
myself
here--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--i
think
that's--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--i
think
that's
their
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
f.
field
however,
it's
patently
false
because...
and
although,
again,
it
might
be
permissible
to
make
that
judgment
in
the
future,
that's
certainly
not
true
of
the
cases
that
are
before
this
court,
and
it's
certainly
not
true...
there's
no
substance
to
any
such
suggestion
of
the
record
here.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
that
may
be.
whether
it's
a
considered
judgment
or
not
i
can't
tell.
it
might
pass
due
process
standards
if
that
were
the
attack;
that
is
to
say
that
if
congress
can
make
this
rule
for
the
future,
might
well
pass
due
process.
it's
a
rational
exercise
of
congress'
power.
but
the
standard
and
the
problem
before
this
court
is
not
that.
it's
the
problem
of
the
attack
or
the
destruction
of
the
pre-existing
interests
which
have
nothing...
as
to
which
those
findings
are
irrelevant
and
constitutionally
have
to
be
because
congress
cannot
decide
the
case
between
a
and
b.
that's
for
this
court
on
review
of
the
trial
of
a
case
to
decide
the
question
between
a
and
b
as
to
whether
under
equitable
principles
or
state
law
an
existing
property
right
is
or
is
not
valid.
the
principle--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
and
so--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--that's
correct.
well,
and
our
position
is
that
with
respect
to
this
lien
voiding,
no
rights
would
ever
be
vested--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--that's
correct.
and
the
suggestion
of
that
that
i
take--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--exactly.
so
that
it's
a...
the
suggestion
i
take
from
that
is
that
congress
certainly
did
not
construe
that
these
interests
were
of
that
character
generally;
that
is,
they
chose
only
to
abolish
or
limit
them
in
a
small
context...
that
is,
bankruptcy.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
f.
field
no.
mr.
henry
f.
field
correct.
absolutely.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
there
are
principles
on
which
such
a
decision
could
be
made
a
court;
that
is,
the
pepper
v.
litton
situation--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--if
it
resulted
in
the
destruction
of...
yes,
i
believe
it
would--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--yes.
i
think
that
would
be
if
the
result
was--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--yes.
and
historically
this
court
has
always
interpreted
such
changes
to
be
for
the
future
only
for
that
very
reason.
the
principle
that
the
government
urges
really
does
not
permit
this
court
or
anyone
else
to
distinguish
between
finance
companies
which
are
here
before
the
court
and
corporate
mortgage
bond
holders
in
multi,
multi-million
dollar,
billion
dollar
corporate
reorganizations,
railroad
reorganizations;
that
is,
the
bald
principle
put
forth
by
the
government
is
that
nonpossessory,
nonpurchase
money
security
interests
are
not
property
interests.
and
i
think
you
have
to
start
with
that,
as
this
court
has
already
indicated.
you
start
with
that
and
where
you
come
out
is
i
believe
under
the
clear
guidelines
this
court
has
established
that
if
it's
a
property
interest
recognized
under
state
law,
it
is
a
property
interest,
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
therefore--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--it
was
not
done,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
f.
field
no.
that
was
construed
to
apply
in
the
auffm'ordt
case
that
we've
cited,
auffm'ordt
v.
rasin.
it
was
construed
to
apply
prospectively--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--to
avoid
the
problem
we're
talking
about
here.
so
this
court
and
the
guidelines
of
this
court
have
been
very
clear
about
what
is
a
property
interest,
and
the
government's
argument
in
that
regard
flies
smack
in
the
face
of
uncontradicted
cases
and
opinions
by
this
court...
you
can
tick
them
off:
the
radford
case,
the
armstrong
case,
many
other
case,
the
general
motors
case...
where
liens
were
upheld.
so
the
fact
that
this
is
a
nonpurchase
money,
nonpossessory
lien
is
irrelevant.
those
are
most
liens.
the
only
exception
perhaps
is
a
pledge.
mr.
henry
f.
field
penn
central.
the
penn
central
case,
the
grand
central
station
case,
is...
was
urged
as
a
taking
in
that
case.
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
a
taking
because
although
the
highest...
perhaps
the
highest
use
of
that
property
was
restricted,
the
owner
of
that
property
was
nonetheless
able
to
gain
a
very
substantial
return,
the
historical
return,
and
could
in
fact
have
built
a
50-story
building
on
that
property
if
he
was
able
to
pass
through
the
commission.
i
don't
believe
the
penn
central
case
in
any
way
suggests
that...
any
analogy
here.
it
poses
an
interesting
counterpoint
between
a
regulatory
act
and
what
you
have
here
which
is
a
total
destruction.
in
the
penn
central
case
they
said
you
have
to
be
careful
about
how
you
build
50-story
buildings
in
new
york.
they
took
a
strand
out
of
the
bundle
of
rights,
and
this
court
upheld
that
action
on
that
ground.
mr.
henry
f.
field
no,
not
completely.
i
think
what
you
have
here
is
a
different
concept.
you've
got
a
lien
that's
on
the
goods,
and
in
this
case
the
goods
are
all
specific
items
which
are,
if
the
lien
is
upheld,
the
value
of
those
items
resorts
to
the
creditor;
if
the
lien
is
not
upheld,
it
completely
eliminates...
it's
completely
eliminated.
so
that
it's
not
a
question
here
of
a
degree.
there
is
either
a
lien
which
is
valid
and
a
creditor
gets
security
and
value
for
the
security
that
he
held,
or
the
lien
is
invalid
and
the
creditor
gets
nothing.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
in...
i
was
referring
only
to
the
cases
before
this
court.
it
is
certainly
conceivable,
as
justice
white
pointed
out
earlier,
that
you'll
have
cases
where
the
property
is
worth
more
than
the
lien,
and
therefore
you'd
have
a
voiding
of
the
lien
only
in
part.
however--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--yes.
and...
and
with
respect
to
that
part,
the
lien
voiding
is
total;
that
is,
it's
unlike
penn
central
in
the
sense
that
where
penn
central
could
nonetheless
build
a
50-story
building,
to
the
extent
of
the
destruction
here,
the
destruction
is...
to
the
extent
of
the
lien
voiding,
the
destruction
is
total.
there
is
nothing
left.
there
is
no
strands
left
for
the
owner
of
the
property.
it's
not
like
a
regulation
where
one
of
the
strands
is
removed.
there's
no
strand
left
at
all.
it's
a
different
concept,
and
in
that
sense
it's
even
further
than
the
loretto
case,
gene
loretto's
case
this
court
had
just
before
the
break
in
the
term,
where
in
a
much
less
dramatic
fashion
the
cable
tv
company
was
allowed
to
intrude
onto
the
physical
property.
in
this
case...
in
a
limited
extent,
and
that
was
deemed
a
taking
without
further
reference
to
purported
justifications.
in
this
case
you
have
a
more
dramatic,
more
extreme
situation.
you've
got,
to
the
extent
of
the
lien,
the
property
affected
by
the
statute
is
totally
destroyed.
it's
not
just
that
somebody
can
put...
can
restrain
our
interest,
can
prevent
us
from
selling
under
certain
circumstances,
can
otherwise
regulate
our
conduct.
we
have
no
property.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
f.
field
yes.
we
affirm
that
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
think
that's
correct,
but
that
was
the
argument
made,
and
it
has
been
an
argument
we
have
made,
and
we
do
affirm
it
in
this
case.
we
do
believe
that
it
is
possible
to
do
that;
that
is,
that
the
constitutional
problem
of
retroactivity
could
be
avoided
by
construing
this
section
to
only
apply
to
the
future.
there's
support
in
the
legislative
history
for
that.
we've
cited
that
in
our
brief.
and
the
normal
canon
of
avoiding
constitutional
questions
would
serve
to
operate
to
effectuate
the
results.
mr.
henry
f.
field
i
think
that's
a--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--possible
construction,
although
i
myself
have
never
really
been
happy
or
able
to
understand
completely
why
that
phraseology
was
written
that
way.
in
any
event,
what
we
have
here
is,
i
would
urge,
a
different
bird
than
this
court
has
seen
in
many
of
its
regulation
cases,
including
the
case
that
justice
blackmun
suggested.
we've
got
really
a
simple
problem,
not
a
complex
problem.
the
government
has
made
it
elaborately
complex.
they
have
used
impermissible
congressional
findings
to
try
to
attack
pre-existing
situations.
they've
called
the
liens
here
weak.
but
when
you
come
to
the
bottom
line,
the
constitution
protects
all
liens,
all
property
interests
that
are
recognized
by
state
law.
now,
there's
no
dollar
sign
on
the
fifth
amendment.
this
court
has
reaffirmed
that
many
times.
so
that
the
de
minimis
aspect
of
this
situation
is
not
really
relevant.
whether
it's
de
minimis
or
not
to
the
government,
it's
extremely
important
to
this
industry
because
there
are
many,
many
millions
of
dollars
of
property
and
value
involved
in
the
aggregate.
the
way
this
statute
works,
for
example,
as
chief
justice
burger
was
asking
earlier,
$200
in
each
item
can
cumulate
to
quite
an
enormous
total.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that,
again,
could
be
a
point
for
the
future,
but
how
they
can
say
that
could
possibly
bear
on
or
be
relevant
to
a's
interest...
does
a
get
a
chance
to
testify
to
the
contrary?
a
says
i
want
my
property...
i
loaned
so-and-so
$5,000
on
this
security:
b,
c,
d,
e,
f,
these
items.
they
were--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--yes.
i
think
that...
well,
in
my
personal
opinion
that
judgment--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--is
wrong.
but
that's
not
really
before
the
court.
mr.
henry
f.
field
okay.
then
i
think
that
that
judgment
has
to
be
looked
at
a
little
differently
than
the
taking
question
i
would
see
as
being
a
retroactive
aspect.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that's
correct.
whether
you
choose
to
use
it,
whether
you
choose
to
repossess.
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
f.
field
precisely,
your
honor.
he
has
the
interest,
and
it
would
be
shocking,
and
it
really
creates
an
irrebuttable
presumption
of
a
past
fact;
that
is,
that
you,
the
litigant,
don't
want
to
do
something,
but
you
don't
have...
you're
deprived
of
your
opportunity
to
say
otherwise.
the
second
ground
on
which
we
would
urge
this
court
to
consider
affirming
the
case
below
is
that
the
bankruptcy
reform
act
of
1978
was
constructed
with
an
infirm
centerpiece,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
northern
pipeline
decision,
and
that
because
of
this,
the
bankruptcy
courts,
which
were
the
sole
courts
intended
and
designed
to
administer
the
bankruptcy
act,
may
not
function.
in
other
words,
the
bankruptcy
act
may
not
be
administered,
and
because
it
may
not
be
administered,
what
happens
is
that
no
court
can
administer
the
1978
act,
and
there
is
no
way
that
those
provisions
can
be--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--no,
your
honor.
the
court's
holding
in
northern
pipeline
was
limited
to
the
fact
that
the
bankruptcy
courts
are
unconstitutional...
the
jurisdictional
grant
in
the
1978
act
was
unconstitutional
in
part,
and
it
was
unseverable,
and
that
unless
congress
does
something,
that
jurisdictional
grant
and
the
court
system
which
is
behind
it
in
241
cannot
function.
now,
as
a
matter
of
intention
and
as
a
matter
of
practice
there's
no
way
that
the
1978
act
can
function
apart
from
those
courts.
mr.
henry
f.
field
your
honor,
that...
whether
that's
true
or
not...
and
that's
true
as
the
matter
of
a
referee
under
the
prior
act...
but
under
the...
the
result
of
the
northern
pipeline
opinion
is
that
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
is
unconstitutional...
is
inseverable
and
therefore
inoperative.
you
don't
need
to
reach
in
this
case
the
further
question
of
whether
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to...
whether
or
not
to
apply
that
in
this
situation
because
what
you
have
is
a
statute
that
no
longer
operates.
so
the...
what
the
result
of
that
is
is
that
the
prior
act
revives
to
govern
bankruptcies.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
that
may
be,
your
honor,
but
at
the
minimum
the
northern
pipeline
decision
holds
that
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
courts
is
inseverable
and
partly
unconstitutional.
therefore,
the
bankruptcy
courts
under
the
'78
act
cannot
function.
and
that
raises
the
further
question
of
well,
then,
who
can
and
how
does
the
bankruptcy...
how
does
the
bankruptcy
system
devised
under
that
act
function?
mr.
henry
f.
field
chico
deals
with
the
situation
of
a
closed
case
and
under
the
linkletter
doctrine
that
this
court
has
announced,
in
this
case
our
clients
can
take
advantage
of
the
northern
pipeline
ruling
and
can
urge
the
position
we
urge
both
in
this
case
and
as
amicus
in
northern
pipeline
while
other
cases
may
not,
because
we
had
presented
this
issue
on
appeal
in
this
court
at
the
same
time,
and
under
the
linkletter
doctrine
that
allows
us
to
take
advantage
of
that
rule...
the
ruling
in
that
case...
for
our
clients.
and
the
effect
of
that
is
that
with
respect
to
us
the
decision
below
was
correctly
decided,
not
because
the
court
below
lacked
jurisdiction
at
all.
it
lacked
jurisdiction
under
the
1978
act,
but
it
had
jurisdiction
under
the
prior
act
and
under
the
prior
act
these
liens
were
protected
so
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
a
decision
of
the
referee,
as
we
would
call
him
now...
the
bankruptcy
judge
referee...
is
correct
because
substantively
the
act
that
he
had
to
guide
himself
by--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--your
lien
is
valid
under
state
law
and
there
is
no...
and
you
should
argue...
i
suppose
you
do...
that
there
is
no
bankruptcy
act
to
avoid
them.
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
f.
field
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
these
liens
are
valid
under
the
only
governing
law,
which
is
with
respect
to
us
and
this
case
could
be
made
prospective
again
so
that
other
cases
aren't
affected.
with
respect
to
us,
the
'78
act
is
inapplicable.
the
prior
law
applies
and
our
liens
are
protected.
mr.
henry
f.
field
as
an
alternate
ground
of
decision,
your
honor.
if
the
lien
voiding
provision
were
retroactively
applied
to
us,
we
would
need
the
prior
law.
mr.
henry
f.
field
absolutely.
mr.
henry
f.
field
well,
you
still
have
to
ask
whether
the
court
below
had
jurisdiction
to
apply
some
bankruptcy
law.
mr.
henry
f.
field
and
the--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--no,
but
if
there
was
jurisdiction
below,
we
would
still
have
to
fight
it
out
in
that
court
as
to
whether
our
interest
was
valid
or
invalid
and
presumably--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--that's
correct.
therefore,
the
result
below
was
right.
the
petition
was
frivolous.
it
should
have
been
dismissed,
and
it
was.
mr.
henry
f.
field
precisely.
a
pepper
versus
litton--
mr.
henry
f.
field
--precisely.
it's
a
pepper
versus
litton
situation.
it
doesn't
exist
in
this
case,
but
it
would
have
been
competent
for
that
court
below
to
have
invalidated
our
lien
had
proof
established
that
we
were
insiders,
that
there
was
some
monkey
business
in
the
obtaining
of
the
lien,
or
some
such
situation.
thank
you,
your
honors.
