we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
security
industrial
bank.
mr.
horowitz,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
include
after-acquired
property?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
quite
a
large
house
if
that's
the
application,
you
could
have
quite
a
large
exemption...
one
of
the
rockefeller
homes,
for
example.
two
hundred
for
each
item
is--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--we'll
resume
at
1:00.
you
may
continue,
mr.
horowitz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
when
congress
enacted
these
provisions
they
had
some
information
about
the
average
secondhand
value
of
most
household
items
and
then
arrived
at
this
$200
figure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
are
some
practical
problems
in
what
has
been
described
as
repossessing.
it
isn't
really
repossessing
because
they've
never
had
possession.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
this
isn't
like
repossessing
an
automobile
which
has
a
license
number
and
a
serial
number
and
is
readily
identified.
this
is
an
amorphous
mass
of
material,
some
of
which
might
belong
to
the
son-in-law
or
mother-in-law
or
what
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
enter
into
creating
some
problems
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
the
time--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--the
lien
is--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--at
the
time
the
lien
attaches.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
the
new
property
coming
in.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
are
some
practical
problems
with
respect
to
the
after-acquired
property,
aren't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
field.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he's
the
only
one
who
can
waive
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
can't
waive
it
for
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
read
that
as
the
court's
holding
in
northern
pipeline?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
horowitz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
united
states
against
the
security
industrial
bank
will
be
announced
by
justice
rehnquist.
chief

thank
you,
