mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
here
is
whether
the
invocation
by
the
various
debtors
in
these
consolidated
cases
of
section
522(f)(2)
of
the
new
bankruptcy
code
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
using
as
an
example
the
cases
of
one
of
these
debtors,
the
relevant
facts
are
as
follows.
on
april
14,
1978,
richard
and
sharon
hunter
took
out
a
small
loan
from
appellee
beneficial
finance
company.
the
total
amount
financed
was
$2,459.
the
hunters
executed
a
printed
security
agreement
in
connection
with
this
loan
in
which
by
the
typing
of
an
x
in
the
appropriate
box
they
pledged
as
security
for
the
loan,
and
i
quote,
"all
household
goods,
excluding
motor
vehicles
but
including
household
furniture,
television
sets,
electrical
appliances,
stereo
phonographs,
furnishings,
carpets,
draperies,
chinaware
and
other
household
goods
of
every
kind
owned
by
them
and
located
in
or
about
their
residence.
"
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
includes
substitutes
for
the
property,
and
i
believe
it
includes
after-acquired
property.
i'm
not
sure.
the
hunters
estimated
the
replacement
value
of
these
goods...
that
is,
the
value
that
it
would...
the
amount
that
it
would
cost
them
to
go
out
and
acquire
the
goods
again...
at
$2,500,
approximately
the
value
of
the
loan.
they
retained
possession
of
all
of
these
goods.
none
of
them
were
turned
over
to
the
finance
company
as
a
pledge.
shortly
after
the
entry
of
this
loan
in
november
1978
the
president
signed
into
law
the
bankruptcy
reform
act
of
1978
which
became
effective
almost
a
year
later
on
october
the
1st,
1979.
some
time
after
that
october
1979
date
when
the
act
became
effective,
which
is
about
one...
at
least
one
and
a
half
years
after
the
loan
was
entered
into...
the
hunters,
unable
to
pay
their
debts,
filed
a
petition
and
bankruptcy.
to
prevent
beneficial
finance
from
seizing
all
of
their
household
goods
pursuant
to
this
boilerplate
security
agreement,
the
hunters
invoked
section
522(f)(2)
of
the
new
bankruptcy
code
to
avoid
the
fixing
of
a
lien
on
those
goods
that
came
within
the
debtors'
exemptions
provided
by
the
code.
now,
to
briefly
explain
the
operation
of
section
522(f)(2),
it
is
a
limited
provision
enacted
by
congress
that
is
an
integral
part
of
congress'
reform
that
was
specifically
directed
at
the
specific
problems
of
consumer
debtors.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
very
different
from
the
fraser-lempke
act,
justice
rehnquist.
the
fraser-lempke
act
was
a
one-time
bailout
of
the
farmers
there
who
were
unable
to
continue
paying
the
mortgages
on
their
farms
because
of
the
depression.
but
there
was
no
real
amendment
of
the
bankruptcy
code
there.
in
fact,
the
amendment
in
the
fraser-lempke
act
was
retroactive
only.
it
would
have
had
no
effect
at
all
on
future
mortgages
that
were
entered
into.
the
law
remained
the
same.
here
there
was
a
wholesale
change
essentially
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
this
was
a
provision
set
up
for
the
way
the
new
bankruptcy
code
would
operate.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
sort
of
the
incidental
effect
of
that
change
in
the
code
as
it
applies
to
security
interests
that
were
entered
into
before
the
act
was
passed.
in
order
to
guarantee
bankrupt
debtors
a
fresh
start,
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
as
one
of
the
key
reasons
for
bankruptcy,
congress
established
a
set
of
federal
exemptions
with
specific
dollar
limitations
on
certain
goods
that
if
deemed
to
be
necessary
for
the
debtors
to
continue
after
bankruptcy...
items
such
as
household
goods,
tools
of
the
debtor's
trade,
and
the
home.
congress
found,
however,
that
similar
exemptions
in
the
past
provided
under
state
law
had
proven
ineffective
in
guaranteeing
the
debtors
this
fresh
start
because,
as
in
this
case,
consumer
finance
companies
had
obtained
blanket
liens
in
all
the
debtor's
household
goods,
thus
enabling
these
creditors
to
levy
on
the
exempt
property
or
to
use
the
threat
of
repossession
of
the
exempt
property
to
compel
the
debtor
to
reaffirm
the
debt
after
bankruptcy.
to
safeguard
these
exemptions
and
make
them
effective,
congress
enacted
section
522(f)(2)
which
enables
the
debtor
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
to
avoid
the
fixing
of
the
liens
on
certain
of
the
exempt
property.
this
avoidance
provision
is
fairly
limited.
it
applies
only
to
certain
kinds
of
liens...
nonpossessory,
nonpurchase
money,
security
interests.
it
applies
to
only
certain
categories
of
the
exemptions
that
were
provided
by
congress;
for
example,
liens
on
motor
vehicles
or
liens
on
a
home
are
not
included
within
the
avoidance
provision.
and
finally
it
is
limited
by
the
dollar
limitations
on
the
value
of
the
exempt
property.
valuable
property
cannot
be
subject
to
avoidance
under
these
provisions.
this
is
the
provision
that
the
hunters
invoked
enabling
them
to
emerge
from
bankruptcy
in
unencumbered
possession
of
their
furniture,
silverware
and
other
household
goods.
and
the
appellees
challenged
the
hunter's
invocation
of
this
section
as
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
despite
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
found...
did
not
challenge
the
congress...
the
need
for
this
legislation
and
the
fact
that
it
was
important
to
achieve
the
congressional
purposes,
the
court
found
that
the
application
to
the
security
interest
involved
in
this
case
in
fact
violated
the
fifth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
exclusively
on
this
court's
decision
in
louisville
joint
stock
land
bank
v.
radford,
decided
in
1935,
and
it
felt
itself
bound
by
that
decision.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yeah.
well,
one
of
the--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
there's
nothing
at
all
in
the
legislative
history
in
the
statute
that
suggests
that
the
section
wouldn't
be
retroactive.
the
act
as
a
whole
seems
to
apply
retroactively.
there's
a
savings
clause
that
makes
clear
that
bankruptcy
proceedings
that
were
begun
before
the
effective
date
of
the
act
are
to
be
decided
under
the
old
act;
that
all
bankruptcy
proceedings
commenced
after
october
1979
are
to
be
heard
under
the
provisions
of
the
new
act.
there's
no
special
exception
for
any
provisions
of
the
act,
and
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense
for
congress...
it
would
just
leave
a
gap
essentially
in
the
statute.
there
would
be
no
law
to
apply
if
the
new
law
didn't
apply.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
this,
this
contention.
they
also
found
there
was
no
evidence
for
it.
the
appellees
have
briefly
argued
that
the
statute
should
be
read
to
be
not
retroactive;
but
they're
also
unable
to
find
anything
directive
of
section
522(f).
essentially
their
position
is
that
the
entire
bankruptcy
code
should
not
be
applied
to
any
security
interests
or
any
other
claims
that
arose
before
the
enactment
date
of
the
act.
and
that
would
just
leave
chaos
essentially.
it
would
postpone
the
effective
date
of
the
act
for
many
years.
and
there's
just
simply
no
evidence
of
that.
so
i
think
we're
pretty
much
stuck
with
the
fact
that
congress
made
the
statute
retroactive,
and
we'll
have
to
address
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
it's
limited
to
$200
in--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yeah.
well,
$200
in
each
item.
so
it's
conceivable
that
the
total
can
be
more
than
$200.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yeah.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
any
household
good
is
exempt
up
to
a
value
of
$200
on
that
item.
the
idea
of
the
exemptions
is
that
these
items
aren't
really...
used
silverware,
used
chairs,
things
like
that
don't
have
much
of
a
resale
value;
they're
not
worth
very
much
to
other
parties.
they
are
worth
something
to
the
debtor
who
has
to
go
out
and
replace
them.
i
think
$200
was
meant
to
make
sure
that
real
luxury
items
that
were
worth
a
lot
of
money
didn't
come
in
under
this
exemption.
so
if
you
have,
for
example,
an
expensive
stereo,
that
would
be
worth
more
than
$200,
and
that
wouldn't
be
exempt;
but
most
items
probably
will
fall
under
that.
and
the
idea
is
for
the
debtor
to
be
able
to
retain
essentially
his
living
room
furniture
and
his
bedroom
furniture,
things
like
that.
if
the
$200
is
an
aggregate,
probably
everything...
most
people
own
a
total
of
things
that
are
worth
more
than
$200.
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
these
blanket
security
interests
in
household
goods
must
be
characterized
as
property
under
the
fifth
amendment,
and
hence,
avoidance
of
these
security
interests
under
section
522(f)
necessarily
must
be
a
taking
without
just
compensation
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
but
this
superficial
analysis
utterly
fails
to
address
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
property
interest
that
is
involved
here,
and
it
is
only
on
that
property
interest
that
congress
narrowly
and
exclusively
focused
its
attention.
unlike
the
traditional
type
of
property
interest,
and
certainly
unlike
the
real
estate
mortgage
that
was
involved
in
radford,
the
creditor
here
has
no
interest
in
actual
physical
possession
of
the
subject
property
or
in
applying
that
property
to
satisfy
the
debt,
even
if
the
debtor
defaults.
congress
found
that
the
used
household
goods
secured
by
these
blanket
liens
are
generally
of
negligible
resale
value
such
that
it
does
not
pay
for
the
creditor
to
physically
repossess
them.
rather,
the
value
of
the
liens
to
the--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
he
has
to
worry
because
the
creditor
can
use
it
as
a
lever
in
order
for
him
to
pay
his
debt.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
one--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
congress'
finding
is
that
it's
not
worth
it
in
dollar
terms.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
the
break
i
was
discussing
the
congressional
findings
here
that
the
used
household
goods
secured
by
these
liens
are
in
fact
of
no
resale
value,
and
therefore,
the
creditor
has
no
interest
in
possession
of
them.
rather,
the
value
of
the
liens
to
the
creditor
is
when
the
property
remains
in
the
possession
of
the
debtor.
it
is
the
threat
of
repossession
of
the
goods
which
gives
the
debtor
a
powerful
incentive
to
agree
to
various
demands
of
the
creditor...
for
example,
to
reaffirm
the
debt...
that
provides
the
creditor's
interest
in
the
lien,
because
the
replacement
value
of
these
goods
to
the
debtor
is
so
high
that
he
cannot
afford
to
have
them
repossessed.
justice
white
asked
me
whether
in
fact
the
individual
debtor
didn't
really
have
to
worry
about
this
because
of
the
congressional
findings,
but,
of
course,
i
think
the
debtor
is
in
no
position
to
call
the
creditor's
bluff
and--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
there
certainly--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--there
certainly
would
be
repossessions
just
for
the
very
sake
of
making
the
threat
credible.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
when
it's
not...
to
reaffirm
the
debt.
that
can
happen,
yes,
sir.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
depending
on
how
much
the
transaction
costs
are
for
having
to
repossess
the
items
and
hold
a
garage
sale
to
sell
them.
it
may
be
worth
the
creditor's
while.
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
they're
used
as
a
threat.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
there's
certainly
nothing
illegitimate
about
it.
it's
one
of
the
normal
functions
of
a
lien,
most
liens,
most
security
interests,
at
least
the
kind
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
in
the
past
in
takings
cases
have
a
second
purpose,
and
that
is
that
the
creditor
takes
the
security
with
the
expectation
that
he
will
take
the
collateral
in
lieu
of
the
debt
if
in
fact
there's
default
on
the
debt.
that
was
certainly
the
case
in
radford.
that
aspect
is
absent
here.
here
the
creditor,
for
example,
does
not
value
the
property
in
determining
how
much
money
he's
going
to
lend
to
the
debtor.
that's
really
irrelevant
to
it.
he
just
looks
at
the
debtor's
income
prospects.
and
so
you
have
cases
like
this
one
in
fact
that
i
mentioned
with
the
hunters
where
the
amount
of
the
loan
at
the
beginning
is
in
fact
in
excess
of
the
value
of
the
collateral.
now,
this--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
but
in
fact
the
goods
are
of
such
negligible
value
that
it's
usually
just
not
worth
the
creditor's
while
to
foreclose.
there
may
be
exceptions,
but
it's
usually
not
worth
his
while
to
try
to
collect
these
goods
and
have
a
fire
sale
and
try
to
get
$25
or
whatever
they're
worth.
now--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
it
hasn't
really
been
litigated
in
this
case
as
to
exactly
what
items
are
covered
by
that
definition.
it's
a
little
broad.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think
"appliances"
certainly
was
meant
to
cover
things
like
refrigerators
and
dryers.
tv
sets...
many
courts
have
held,
i
think,
that
tv
sets
are
covered
by
that
language.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
it
varies.
as
i
said,
there
is
this
limitation
of
$200
all
together;
that
this
section
wouldn't
even
cover
if
there
was,
in
fact...
so
the
goods
by
definition
here
have
a
resale
value
of
less
than
$200.
now,
you
could
have
a
case
where
the
debtor
had
a
lot
of
goods
that
were
worth
$199,
and
it
might
be
worth
it
for
the
creditor
to
go
in.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right.
and
then
if
you
had
a
$500
refrigerator,
then
i
don't
think
the
debtor
could
use
section
522(f)(2)
to
protect
against
the
creditor
repossessing
the
refrigerator
because--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
think
that's
right,
yes.
now,
getting
back
to
what
justice
o'connor
asked
me,
it
is
true
that
the
security
interest
here
is
as
a
means
of...
is
to
encourage
the
debtor
to
repay
his
debt,
and
that
is
a
legitimate
purpose
of
a
security
interest.
but
what
you
have
here
because--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yeah,
exactly.
but
it
doesn't--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--right.
that
would
reduce
the
value
of
the
security
interest.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
but
it
doesn't
completely--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--right.
but
the
argument
that's
been
made
here
by
the
tenth
circuit
and
by
the
appellees
is
that
there's
no
value
left
to
the
security
interest
at
all,
and
that's
in
fact
not
true.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yeah.
well,
they
did.
there
was
a
study
done
by
the
ftc
which
investigated
these
kind
of
practices
and
found
that
usually
it
was
not...
i
think
the
$200
figure,
i
don't
know
if
that
was
based
on
a
study
or
just
on
congress'
perception
of
what
it
was
fair
to
leave
the
debtor
with
and
what
would
be
a
luxury
item
otherwise.
i
think
what
is
significant
about
these
security
interests
is
that
their
only
use
is
as
a
means
of
compelling
the
debtor
to
repay,
and
therefore,
you
don't
really
have
an
independent
property
interest
here,
as
the
tenth
circuit
found;
but
the
security
interest
here
cannot
as
a
practical
matter
be
separated
from
the
debtor's
personal
obligation.
now,
of
course,
the
creditor
ordinarily
has
a
right
to
have
the
debtor
satisfy
his
personal
obligation.
but
here
you
have
a
debtor
in
bankruptcy,
and
the
whole
point
of
bankruptcy
is
to
discharge
the
debtor's
personal
obligation
and
to
allow
him
to
have
a
fresh
start
unencumbered
by
prior
debt.
so
the
question
here
is
why
should
these
debtors
who
have
the
security
interests
but
that
are
in
fact
are
no
different
from
the
personal
obligation,
why
should
they
be
in
any
better
position
than
the
unsecured
creditor
to
also--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--it's
not
that
he's
no
different,
but
for
the
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment
the
question
is
whether
such
a
sharp
line
should
be
drawn
between
the
kind
of
paper
security
interest
that
you
have
here
where
in
fact
there's
no
actual
interest
in
taking
the
property
or
in
reselling--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--but
for
the
purposes
of
the
takings
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
it's
important
to
focus
on
the
type
of
property
interest
you
have
here.
i
think
this
question
is
discussed
well
in
the
seventh
circuit's
recent
7
to
1
en
banc
decision
in
the
gifford
case
on
this
exact
question.
the
fact
is
that
there
is
very
little
in
the
sense
of
fifth
amendment
property
that
is
being
taken
away
from
the
debtor
here.
what's
being
taken
away
is
his
expectation
of
repayment
by
the
debtor,
and
that's
the
same
thing
that
is
always
taken
away
in
bankruptcy
from
unsecured
creditors
and
from
everyone
else.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
what
kind
of
destruction
of
these
liens,
these
kinds--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
mean,
for
example,
in
the
armstrong
case
the
court
held
that
the
destruction
of
the
liens
there
was
compensable.
and
this
court--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes,
i'd
agree
with
the
armstrong
case.
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
these
takings
cases
have
to
be
decided
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
by
looking
at
all
the
factors.
you
have
to
balance
what
the
government
interest
was
here.
in
a
case
like
radford
where
congress
essentially
just
passed
a
bailout...
it
wasn't
part
of
just
a
bankruptcy
code
kind
of
revision...
you
have
much
less
of
a
government
interest
in
that
kind
of
thing
and
a
commensurate
lesser
property
interest.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
would
agree
that
there's
a
property
interest
created
under
kansas
law
by
these
liens.
whether
they're...
i
disagree
that
they're
liens
in
specific
property
in
the
sense
that
this
court
used
that
term
in
radford.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
know
of
any
difference
in
the
state
laws.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think
the
security
agreement
provides
that--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
debtor
has
to
pile
all
the
furniture
in
his
living
room,
i
think,
and
make
it
ready
for
them,
and
then
they
can
go
in.
now,
what
happens--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
was
addressed
there.
no.
repossession
is
used--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yeah.
well,
the
debtor--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
debtor
is
usually
required
to
make
a
list
of
some
of
the
property
he
has,
so--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
suppose...
at
the
time
he
enters
into
the
loan.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right.
the
lien
is
not
restricted
to
that
property,
but
that
gives
the
creditor
something.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i'm
not
sure
how
the
after-acquired
property
is
handled
under
the
laws
of
these
various
states.
there
could
be
litigation,
i
suppose,
over
whether
particular
property
is
covered
by
the
lien.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
language
i
read
from
the
lien
says
all
property
in
a
house,
so
that
well
may
cover
all
after-acquired
property.
i
think
the
real
defect
in
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
here
is
that
it
simply
found
that
because
these
liens
could
be
construed
as
a
property
interest
and
because
their
value
is
undoubtedly
impaired
by
the
invocation
of
section
522(f),
the
court
concluded
that
there
must
be
a
taking
here;
that
in
fact
the
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
in
recent
years...
the
penn
central
case,
for
example...
that
you
have
to
look
at
both
the
investment-backed
expectations
of
the
creditor
and
the
nature
of
the
government
action
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
taking.
since
my
time
is
short,
i
think
i'll
refer
to
the
brief
pretty
much
for
that
statement.
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
penn
central
test,
there
is
in
fact...
in
view
of
the
limited
expectation
of
the
creditors
here
there
is
in
fact
no
taking.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
take
issue
with
mr.
field's
statement
that
this
court
cannot
distinguish
between
different
kinds
of
property.
clearly
this
court
can
and
must
distinguish
between
property
interest
like
the
fee
simple
and
real
property
or
mortgage
and
real
property,
and
the
kind
of
security
interest
that's
involved
here.
all
of
the
takings
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
involve
making
judgments
by
this
court
as
to
the
character
of
the
government
action,
the
economic
expectations.
they
don't
admit
of
a
bright
line
rule,
and
certainly
an
important
feature
that
the
court
must
consider
in
these
cases
is
the
nature
of
the
property
interest
that
hasn't
been
prominent
in
some
of
the
court's
recent
decisions
because
they
were
always
dealing
in
these
cases
with
a
traditional
real
property
interest.
here
we
have
this
fairly
negligible
property
interest
that
is
almost
indistinguishable
from
the
right
to
collect
on
the
debt,
and
the
court
has
to
take
that
into
account.
as
far
as
whether
the
lien
has
been
totally
destroyed
here,
as
the
tenth
circuit
said,
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
the
fact
that
it
really
isn't,
and
justice
stevens
has
alluded
to
that.
i
would
just
urge
the
court
to
compare
the
destruction
that
you
have
here
with
the
destruction
in
anders
against
allers,
the
eagle
feathers
case,
and
i
think
that
you
will
agree
there
is
no
more
of
a
total
destruction
here.
but
even
assuming
that
there
is,
i
think
it's
very
instructive
to
look
at
the
armstrong
case,
which
justice
o'connor
alluded
to.
if
you
look
at
the
court's
analysis
in
that
case,
the
court
quickly
decided
that
the
lien
involved
there
in
fact
was
a
compensable
property
interest
and
that
the
lien
there
was
totally
destroyed.
the
court
then
went
on
for
several
pages
to
decide
whether
in
fact
that
was
a
taking.
clearly,
the
fact
that
the
property
interest
was
destroyed
was
not
sufficient
to
show
as
a
taking,
and
there
they
found
the
taking
only
because
the
nature
of
the
government
action
was
a
taking
of
the
property
for
the
government's
own
benefit
in
its
entrepreneurial
capacity
and
indeed
three
justices
dissented
on
that
ground.
so
i
think
here
you
also
have
to
look
at
the
taking
analysis
set
out
in
penn
central,
and
because
this
is
an
ordinary
government
regulation
like
the
minimum
wage
legislation
and
because
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
substantial
expectation
of
the
creditor.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right.
it
wasn't
worth
much
as
a
property.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
it's
worth
even
less
than
eastman
and
loretto
because
there
you
at
least
have
a
real
property,
a
traditional
kind
of
property
interest,
which
was
someone's
possession
of
property.
here
you
have--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--not
in
this
context,
where
there's
no
expectation
of
possession.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
justice,
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
there
were
no
property
interest
here
of
course
we
wouldn't
be
here,
because
then
there
would
be
no
claim
of
a
taking
at
all.
but
i
think
the
court
has
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
property
interest
is
weak
and
that
it's
very
hard
to
separate
the
property
interest
here
from
the
debtor's
personal
obligation,
and
the
fact
is
that
the
whole
idea
of
bankruptcy
is
to
discharge
the
debtor's
personal
obligation.
now
creditors'
expectations
are
always
hurt
or
disappointed
to
some
extent
by
bankruptcy
legislation
and
actions
of
bankruptcy
courts.
i
think
if
you
look
at
some
of
the
cases
this
court
has
decided...
the
local
loan
versus
hunt
case,
for
example,
where
there
was
a
lien
in
future
wages
that
was
valid
under
state
law,
and
the
court
held
those
constitutional
for
that
lien
to
be
invalidated.
you
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
lien,
to
some
extent,
and
the
nature
of
the
government
interest.
i'd
like--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
would
state
you
have
the
additional
problem
of
the
contract
clause,
which
forbids
any
impairment
of
contract
by
the
state.
that's
why
states,
i
think,
can't
pass
bankruptcy
legislation
to
start
with.
here
you
do
have
an
impairment
of
the
property
interest.
our
argument
is
that
that
impairment
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
fifth
amendment
taking.
so
i
think
there
would
be
a
lot
more
problem
with
the
state.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
my
immediate
reaction,
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
mean
one
problem
here
is
that
the
creditor
here
is
not
seeking
to
enable
to
use
his
lien
entirely,
and
that
is
to
be
able
to
get
the
debtor
to
reaffirm
the
debt...
have
the
whole
lien
survive.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
but
in
passing
legislation
congress
has
to
make
the
general
judgment
as
to
what--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
if
it
was
only
for
the
future,
there
would
be
no
fifth
amendment
claim
at
all,
obviously,
because
there
wouldn't
be
any
taking
of
any
property
if
this
act
was
already
on
the
books
that
these
liens
could
be
avoided.
that
would
just
be
ridiculous
to
claim
the
fifth
amendment,
so
i
mean
it
is
only
the
retroactivity
that
raises
the
taking
question
at
all.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
and
i
think
it's
necessary
to
consider
the
nature
of
the
regulation
in
doing
so.
my
time
has
expired.
