mr.
horowitz,
i
suppose
the
problem
of
the
fifth
amendment
question
could
have
been
avoided
if
it
had
been
determined
that
the
provision
was
not
intended
to
be
retroactive,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
leads...
what
leads
you
to
believe
that
congress
intended
retroactive
application
of
this
section?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
horowitz,
is
there
anything
illegitimate
about
using
liens
to
encourage
payment,
and
isn't
that
really
the
normal
function
of
a
lien?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
horowitz,
under
your
arguments
what
type
of
destruction
of
liens,
if
any,
would
be
compensable
under
the
fifth
amendment
takings
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
any
liens,
if
not
these.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
agree
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
take
it
you
concede
that
under
kansas
law
the
liens
here
are
liens
on
specific
property.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
not
true,
is
it,
if
the
items
are
worth
more
than
the
$200?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
also
some
support
in
the
language
of
section
522(f)
itself
where
it
says
that
the
debtor
may
avoid
the
fixing
of
a
lien
on
an
interest
of
the
debtor
and
property
to
the
extent
that
such
lien
impairs
an
exemption
to
which
the
debtor
would
have
been
entitled
under
subsection
(b)
by
saying
he
wouldn't
have
been
entitled
to
an
exemption
prior
to
the
effective
date--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
the
act.
