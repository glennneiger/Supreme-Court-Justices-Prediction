mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
construction
of
section
4f(b)
of
the
hart-scott-rodino
act
of
1976
and
rule
6(e)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
we
believe
there
are
two
inter-related
questions:
first,
whether
the
investigative
files
or
other
materials
of
the
united
states
attorney
general
also
includes
materials
covered
or
encompassed
by
rule
6(e);--
and
second,
if
so,
what
is
the
discretionary
standard
to
be
followed
by
a
district
court
in
determining
whether
to
release
materials
covered
by
rule
6(e)
pursuant
to
request
by
a
state
attorney
general
under
section
4f(b).
very
briefly
with
respect
to
the
facts,
in
the
late
1970's
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
conducted
a
complex
and
lengthy
investigation
of
the
piping
and
sheet
metal
industries
in
illinois.
that
investigation
focused
on
conspiracies
among
competitors
in
those
industries
to
rig
bids
on
public
projects,
mostly
school
projects
in
the
chicago
area.
after
the
state
of
illinois
had
received
notice
under
section
4f(a)
that
it
had
a
potential
cause
of
action,
it
made
a
request
to
the
united
states
attorney
general
for
all
relevant
investigative
files
or
other
materials
under
section
4f(b).
in
response
at
that
time,
we
were
provided
with
19
pages
of
preliminary
memoranda
generated
long
before
the
grand
jury
had
been
transferred
to
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
everything
else,
we
were
informed,
was
covered
by
rule
6(e),
and
that
the
government
would
support
our
request
for
a
court
order
releasing
the
materials.
subsequently
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
chicago
board
of
education
filed
two
class
action
treble
damage
lawsuits
on
behalf
of
the
public
entities
in
the
area
seeking
to
recover
the
overcharges
suffered
by
those
entities
as
a
result
of
the
conspiracy.
the
criminal
actions
have
long
ago
terminated.
the
civil
cases
are
still
proceeding
with
discovery,
and
in
that
regard
a
few
of
the
transcripts
in
one
of
the
cases
may
be
disclosed
to
us
pursuant
to
rule
6(e)
because
those
transcripts
were
previously
disclosed
to
the
defendants.
turning
to
the
first
question,
i
believe
it
takes
great
liberties
with
the
very
broad
expansive
language
of
that
statute
to
conclude
that
information
relating
to
matters
or
occurrences
before
an
investigative
grand
jury
is
somehow
not
contained
in
a
prosecutor's
files
or
other
materials.
we
believe
the
statute
plainly
includes
all
materials
compiled
by
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
general
to
prepare
and
prosecute
his
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
well,
i
think
we
first
have
to
address
the
question
of
whether
it
is
part
of
the
investigative
files
or
other
materials
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
okay.
well,
i
believe
the
united
states
attorney
general
is
supposed
to
retain
custody
of
the
grand
jury
transcripts
and
documents.
for
example,
if
the
documents
are
no
longer
in
the
possession--
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
--no,
i
don't
believe
they're
in
the
possession
of
the
court.
they're
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states
attorney
general.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
no,
justice
rehnquist.
we
believe
that,
first
of
all,
we
look
at
the
statute
and
decide
what
the
congress
intended
to
cover
by--
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
--no,
i
just
meant
to
go
to
the
next
point,
which
is
that
the
"extent
permitted
by
law"
language
raises
the
question
of
by
what
standard
the
court
should
release
the
materials.
the
court
can
authorize
the
united
states
attorney
general
to
turn
the
information
over
to
a
state
attorney
general.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
we
do
not
say,
we
have
never
said,
that
it
is
automatic
disclosure
upon
demand.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
we
believe
that
the
court
should
inquire,
first
of
all,
what
reasons
for
secrecy
remain
in
the
transcripts,
in
the
documents.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
by
the
language
"extent
permitted
by
law".
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
we
believe
that
refers
to
rule
6(e),
which
indicates
that
a
court
may
disclose
materials
preliminarily
to
or
in
connection
with
a
judicial
proceeding.
and
we
understand
the
standard
under
rule
6(e)
to
involve
a
careful
assessment
of
the
needs
for
secrecy
and
the
needs,
to
the
extent
they
remain,
and
the
compelling
interest
in
disclosure.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
we
believe
that
the
particularized
need
requirement
arose
in
cases
involving--
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
--well,
we
believe
you
need
the
hart...
well,
the
hart-scott-rodino
act
is
designed
to
state
the
congressional
purpose,
to
state
to
whom
the
materials--
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
--the
statute
is
an
expression
of
congressional
intent,
not
only
with
respect
to
grand
jury
materials--
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
--that's
why
we
need
the
statute,
because
the
congress
has
indicated
the
intention,
the
reasons
why,
for
national
antitrust
enforcement--
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
--that
is
correct.
maybe
i
misspoke,
justice.
i'm
sorry
if
i...
could
you
repeat
the
question?
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
we
believe
that
it
is
not
only
because
we
are
a
public
entity,
but
also
because
the
congress
with
respect
to
this
specific
matter
has
indicated
an
intent
that
the
materials
be
turned
over.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
oh,
i
see.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
i
believe
that
we
may
be
able
to
do
that.
but
that
is
a
question
that--
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
--we
need
the
statute
because
the
statute
quite
clearly
states
that
in
this
regard,
with
respect
to
antitrust
enforcement
by
the
states,
congress
has
indicated
a
compelling
need
in
the
balance
for
determining--
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
--yes,
we
believe
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
yes,
we
believe
that
the
showing
of
need
for
disclosure
has
been
demonstrated
by
congress,
has
been
supplied
by
congress;
and
you
balance
that
against
what
reasons
remain
with
respect
to
the
particular
materials
in
the
file
which
countervailingly--
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
--pardon
me?
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
yes.
we
have
to
demonstrate,
i
think,
the
degree
of
secrecy
that
remains
or
should
remain.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
we
have
to
show
that
the
materials
are
relevant
to
a
potential
cause
of
action
of
the
united
states...
of
the
state
attorney
general,
and
that
the
reasons
for
secrecy
are
no
longer
viable.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
that
is
the
exact
purpose
of
the
statute,
to...
congress
did
more
than
simply
confer
standing
on
state
attorneys
general.
it
wanted
to
facilitate
a
coordination,
communicative
effort
between
the
state
and
federal
attorney
generals
with
respect
to
local
and
regional
antitrust
enforcement.
and
it
believed
quite
clearly
in
the
legislative
history
that
that
could
not
be
done
unless
sufficient
investigational
information
was
made
available
to
the
state
attorney
general.
the
problem
we
have
here
is
that
whenever
the
government
brings
a
criminal
antitrust
action
all
or
virtually
all
of
the
information,
certainly
all
the
valuable
and
significant
information,
is
covered
by
rule
6(e).
and
we
believe
that
the
intent
of
congress
is
frustrated
by
reading
the
statute
so
as
to
require
a
state
attorney
general
to
make
the
same
showing
of
need
as
a
private
litigant
in
private
litigation
cases.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
justice
o'connor,
in
this
case
they
were
notified.
there
are,
i
believe,
probably
nearly
a
hundred
respondents
in
this
case.
we
do
not
know
who
they
all
are.
but
i
understand
at
the
very
outset
the
district
court
directed
the
united
states
attorney
general
to
notify
the
parties
involved.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
i
believe
that--
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
--there's
nothing
in
the
statute,
but
i
think
the
common
procedure
under
rule
6(e)
is
to,
at
least
in
my
experience,
is
to
contact
all
interested
parties,
which
would
include
not
only
witnesses
but
also
defendants
in
a
particular
case
in
which
the
materials
are
sought
to
be
used.
we
have
found
in
this
case
that
reading
the
statute
so
as
not
to
include
grand
jury
material
is
not
only...
it
not
only
raises
the
problem
in
the
practical
sense
of
trying
to
separate
out
rule
6(e)
from
non-rule
6(e)
in
a
single
file
of
the
prosecutor,
but
also,
as
we
have
found
in
this
case,
such
an
interpretation
excludes
the
essence
of
the
information
in
those
files.
we
believe
that
is
in
direct
contradiction
to
what
congress
intended
when
it
passed
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
as
a
practical
matter,
4f(b)
was
designed
to
disclose
to
the
attorney
general
before
he
filed
a
case
whether
he
had
a
case
and
to
assist
him
in
bringing
the
action.
it's
very
important
before
you
embark
on
an
action
of
this
magnitude.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
right.
and
so
it
would
be
very
difficult
in
almost
every
instance,
particularly
where
there's
been
a
grand
jury
investigation,
for
the
state
attorney
general
to
state
to
the
court
with
any
great
degree
of
particularity
the
information
that
he
needs
to
carry
out
the
intent
of
congress.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
he
would
have
to
file
suit,
he
would
have
to
undertake
discovery
first,
and
attempt
to
show
a
particularized
need
two
or
three
years
later.
nor
do
we
believe
that
the
language
"upon
request"
in
the
statute
was
meant
to
limit
or
define
the
materials
which
are
disclosable.
we
believe
instead
that
it
only
states
the
initiation
of
a
process
of
disclosure,
speaking
again
not
only
of
grand
jury
materials
but
of
all
materials
in
the
file,
which
may
involve
work
product,
trade
secrets
and
so
forth.
for
example,
in
the
colonial
chevrolet
case
the
bill
of
particulars
was
placed
under
seal
by
the
district
court.
upon
the
request
of
the
state
attorney
general,
the
united
states
attorney
general
could
not
have...
would
not
have
been
empowered
to
turn
the
bill
of
particulars
over.
yet
the
law
permits
disclosure
of
bills
of
particulars
and...
but
it
requires
a
court
order.
another
common
situation
is
where
in
a
government
civil
enforcement
action
the
defendants
insist
that
the
record
be
placed
under
seal
of
court.
upon
the
request
of
the
state
attorney
general,
the
federal
attorney
general
lacks
the
power
to
disclose.
but
a
court
order
will
permit
that
disclosure,
because
the
law
permits
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
well,
i
think
it
entitles
the
united
states
attorney
general
to
raise
within
the
context
of
rule
6(e)
remaining
interests
in
secrecy
which
he
may
have
or
may
want
to
assert--
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
--if
the
law
permits
it
he
could.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
in
a
situation
where,
for
example,
a
proffer,
the
government
is
apparently
unsure
whether
that
is
covered
by
rule
6(e).
of
course,
in
this
case
the
united
states
attorney
general
has
made
the
determination
that
it
ought
to
be
disclosed.
in
a
situation
where
he
felt
that
shouldn't
be
the
case,
we
might
be
dealing
with
an
informant's
privilege
or
some
other
kind
of
privilege,
and
in
that
situation
again
we
would
have
to
look
to
see
if
the
privilege,
work
product,
whatever
it
is,
is...
how
that
weighs
against
the
congressional
desire,
intent,
very
strong
intent
that
these
materials
be
made
available
to
a
state
attorney
general
so
that
he
can
pursue
his
own
actions.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
it
could
happen
that
on
occasion
the
state
attorney
general
and
the
united
states
attorney
general
could
be
adversaries
with
respect
to
a
particular
matter.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
i
think
that
in
a
situation
where
materials
have
not
been
disclosed
it
could
be
a
mandamus
action.
it
could
be...
for
example,
it
could
be
a
rule
6(e)
proceeding
where
it's
grand
jury
materials.
it
could
take
place
within
the
confines
of
a
civil
case
which
has
already
been
filed
by
a
state
attorney
general.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
material
at
stake.
we
believe
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit,
the
reasoning
of
the
seventh
circuit,
is
in
grave
error
as
well,
for
one
particular
reason:
it
essentially
concluded
that
a
state
attorney
general's
need
for
the
disclosure
of
the
investigative
material
is
the
same
as
a
private
litigant's
need.
that
reasoning,
if
applied
to
all
the
materials
in
rule
6(e),
effectively
means
that
a
state
attorney
general
is
only
entitled
to
what...
the
same
materials
he
received
before
the
statute
was
passed
and,
oddly
enough,
to
the
same
materials
which
any
private
party
could
obtain.
in
essence,
what
that
means
is
section
4f(b)
is
a
nullity;
it
doesn't
add
anything
to
the
law.
the
congressional
intent
is
simply
ignored
by
that
sort
of
conclusion.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
well,
i
would
believe
that
that
may
very
well
be
disclosable
to
a
private
party.
if
there
is
no
reason
why
a
private
party
could
not
get
it,
then
i
would
assume
a
private
party
could
obtain
it
as
well.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
no,
i
don't
believe
that's...
i'm
not
sure
if
the
attorney
general
has
a
policy
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
genovese
very
quickly,
i
think
there's
a
tremendous
gap
between
what
congress
was
attempting
to
accomplish
when
it
passed
section
4f(b)
and
how
respondents
interpret
the
statute.
congress
wanted
the
states
to
have
valuable
information
prior
to
the
institution
of
a
lawsuit,
because
congress
understood
that
in
order
to
have
local
and
national
antitrust
enforcement
it
was
essential
that
the
states,
and
because
the
states
lacked
the
resources,
it
was
essential
the
states
have
this
information
in
order
to
bring
these
kinds
of
cases.
respondents'
interpretation
i
think
creates
a
kind
of
inverse
relationship
between
need
and
disclosure.
the
more
significant
and
valuable
the
information
in
the
government's
file,
under
the
respondents'
interpretation,
the
less
likely
that
it
could
ever
be
produced
to
a
state
attorney
general.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
it
is
only
the
significant
and
valuable
information
which
is
presented
to
an
investigative
grand
jury.
what
is
left
is
uninformative,
whether
it's
19
pages
or
however
many,
and
it
could
also
be
misleading
and
grossly
inaccurate
to
a
state
attorney
general
who
has
to
make
a
decision
of
whether
he's
going
to
undertake
the
resource
drain
of
filing
these
kinds
of
actions
in
accordance
with
congress'
intent.
are
there
any
questions?
