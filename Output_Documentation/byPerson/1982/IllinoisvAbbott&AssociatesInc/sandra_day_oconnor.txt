on
the
need
for
secrecy
inquiry
of
the
court,
i
suppose
some
of
the
people
most
concerned,
who
might
want
to
oppose
the
disclosure,
would
be
people
who
may
have
been
questioned
before
the
grand
jury
but
weren't
indicted,
for
example.
they
would
have
no
means
of
obtaining
notice,
i
suppose,
that
the
disclosure
was
even
being
sought,
would
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
certainly
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
about
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
we
don't
really
address
that
problem.
justice

mr.
genovese,
would
you
mind
addressing
how
you
think
that
the
particularized
need
standard
would
require
the
state
to
do
more
than
inquire
into
relevance
and
the
need
for
secrecy?
what
else
would
that
do
as
a
practical
matter
in
increasing
the
state's
burden?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
existing
judicial
proceeding,
in
other
words?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
require
a
pending
lawsuit?
does
the
state
attorney
general
have
to
have
filed
an
antitrust
action
already
in
order
to
establish
a
particularized
need?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
response
that
was
given
this
morning
was
that
the
particularized
need
standard
did
require,
in
the
cases
that
have
applied
it,
a
pending
suit,
not
just
the
application
to
the
court
under
rule
6(e).
