justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
you're
saying
that
if
a
transcript
of
the
testimony
is
in
the
hands
of
the
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
antitrust
division
or
the
attorney
general,
you're
entitled
to
it
under
this
statute
with
no
court
proceedings
at
all,
but
if
the
same
transcript
is
in
the
possession
of
the
court
you
have
to
make
some
showing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
need
to
be
that
elaborate
to
answer
the
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
if
the
material,
if
the
transcript,
the
physical
transcript,
is
in
the
possession
of
the
justice
department,
the
justice
department
must
join
you
in
going
to
court
even
though
it
has
physical
possession,
is
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
what
sort
of
an
inquiry
would
the
court
make
in
that
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
get
that
out
of
the
statute?
where
do
you
get
the
nature
of
the
court's
inquiry
from
the
statutory
language?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
do
you
think
that
refers
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
genovese,
in
respect
to
section
(b)
of
section
15f,
which
is
the
one
we're
talking
about,
i
take
it.
do
you
think
the
phrase
"permitted
by
law"
refers
only
to
the
strictures
that
cases
may
put
on
disclosure
of
grand
jury
testimony?
do
you
think,
for
instance,
that
it
prevents
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
from
ever
saying,
no,
we
don't
choose
to
divulge
this
to
you,
state
attorney
general?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
what
you're
seeking
isn't
grand
jury
testimony,
but
notes
of
an
interview
that
the
government
took,
not
under
a
subpoena
but
just
with
a
witness,
and
the
attorney
general
says,
i
just
want
to
protect
this
witness,
i'm
not
going
to
turn
it
over
to
you.
can
he
do
that
under
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
law
do
you
turn
to
to
decide
whether
it
permits
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
you
leave
open
the
possibility
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
state
attorney
general
would
be
almost
adversaries,
i
suppose,
and
the
attorney
general
would
raise
the
question
of
work
product,
and
then
what,
some
court
would
have
to
decide
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
a
court
proceeding
would
you
have
to
resolve
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
would
certainly
leave
you
with
access
to
the
attorney
general's
files
that
weren't
submitted
to
the
grand
jury,
that
he
wouldn't
otherwise
have
to
give
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
the
attorney
general
has
had
a
policy
of
not
disclosing
to
anybody,
hasn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
that
cited
in
the
briefs,
mr.
wilkins?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
rule
6(c),
in
any
event?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
6(e).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
possibility
the
government
might
want
to
bring
civil
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
united
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
would
that
be
a
reason
that
the
attorney
general
might
not
want
to
turn
over
as
of
that
point
to
state
attorneys
general
the
transcript
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
that's
all
it
takes
to
show
particularized
need
for
a
private
plaintiff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
case
from
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
procter
&
gamble
and
the
leading
cases
from
this
court
addressing
that
inquiry
certainly
don't
suggest
that
that
result
should
obtain.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
i
don't
suppose
it's
any
superhuman
feat
to
file
a
lawsuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
concede
that
congress
meant
to
give
some
help
to
state
attorneys
general
by
the
provisions
of
4(b)
and
you
say
that
the
phrase
"investigative
files
or
other
materials"
doesn't
include
grand
jury
testimony,
is
there
some
way
of
telling
from
this
record
just
how
much
help
that
would
be?
i
mean,
does
the
attorney
general
typically
have
files
which
shed
all
sorts
of
light
on
a
particular
suit
but
aren't
grand
jury
testimony?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
manual
statement
made
after
the
enactment
of
4(b)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
you
understand
the
government,
the
united
states
government,
to
take
the
position
that
saying
that
the
attorney
general
shall
make
available
to
the
state
attorney
general
to
the
extent
permitted
by
law
allows
the
united
states
attorney
general
some
discretion,
even
though
it's
not
grand
jury?
