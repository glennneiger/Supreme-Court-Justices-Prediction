justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
attorney
general
came
back
and
said,
we
don't
have
a
transcript
of
the...
what
happened
before
the
grand
jury
any
more.
maybe
we
had
it
once,
but
we
don't.
but
we'll
be
glad
to...
to
support
your
request
before
the
judge.
do
you
think
the
standard
then
when
you
went
to
the
judge
would
be
rule
6(e)
or
would
you
say,
the
statute
has
made
this
material
available
to
us
on
a
lesser
showing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
attorney
general
says,
we
just
don't
have
a
transcript
any
more
now,
and
let's
just
assume
that's
correct,
that's
accurate,
he's
telling
the
truth.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
they're
not
in
the
possession
of
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
you
don't
even
need
to
go
to
court,
do
you?
that's
what
i'd
like
to
find
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
attorney
general
isn't
free
to
deal
with
these
materials
like
he
might
some
other
materials.
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
the
custodian.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
act,
when
the
attorney
general
turns
something
over
like
grand
jury
materials,
is
there
any
stricture
on
its
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
he
have
to
give
them
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
whom
they
may
disclose
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
they
be
used
for
taking
depositions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
makes
it
pretty
public,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
ask...
if
you're
going
to
ask
somebody
a
question
and
then
you
say,
well,
did
you
really
answer,
answer
the
same
way
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
big
hassle
about,
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
sound
like
much
of
a
hurdle
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you're
going
to
have
to
go
to
court,
you're
going
to
have
to
go
to
court
anyway.
you
don't
suggest
you
don't
have
to
go
to
the
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
going
to
have
to
go
to
court
and
get
him
to
rule
on
it.
if
there's
an
objection
and
an
argument
about
it,
it's
going
to
take
some
time
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
not
if
it...
it
isn't
very
compelling
and
particularized
if
all
you
have
to
do
is
say,
we
need
it
for
a
deposition,
we
need
it
to
impeach
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think,
then,
that
4f(b)
just
wasn't
intended
to
work
any
change
with
respect
to
grand
jury
minutes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
it
do?
what
range
did
4f(b)
have
if
it
doesn't
affect
grand
jury
minutes?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
gather
an
awful
lot
of
information
just
outside
the
grand
jury,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
congress
think
it
was
doing
in
4f(b)?
was
all
this
non-grand
jury
information--
justice
byron
r.
white
--available
before
the
act
was
passed,
or
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
attorney
general
would
just
withhold
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
4f(b)
removed
that
discretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
you
think
if
the
attorney
general
had
a
series
of
regulations
that
dealt
with
the
availability
of
his
investigative
files
aside
from
grand
jury,
and
everybody
agrees
those
regulations
were
within
his
authority
to
issue
under
the
controlling
statutes.
in
short,
they
had
the
force
of
law.
do
you
think
this
4f(b)
was
intended
by
saying
"to
the
extent
permitted
by
law.
"
to
recognize
that
those
regulations
would
govern,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
despite
the
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
had
the
force
of
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
had
the
force
of
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
you
have
to,
in
order
to
reach
those
non-jury
files
that
the
attorney
general
used
to
refuse
to
turn
over
pursuant
to
a
regulation,
you
would
have
to
get
rid
of
the
regulation.
you'd
have
to
override
the
regulation.
you'd
have
to
say
4f(b)
was
intended
to
override
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
doesn't
it
override
6(b)?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
it
override
6(b)?
justice
byron
r.
white
6(e),
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
submission
of
your
colleagues
on
the
other
side
is
that
4f(b)
amended,
in
effect
amended
6(e)--
justice
byron
r.
white
--which
is
the
statute,
which
is
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be,
but
their
submission
is
that
6(e)
wasn't
the
same
animal
after
this,
after
4f(b),
as
it
was
before.
