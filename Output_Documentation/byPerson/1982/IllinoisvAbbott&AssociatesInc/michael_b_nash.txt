mr.
michael
b.
nash
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
can
begin
by
addressing
myself
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question
concerning
particularized
need,
and
mr.
justice
white.
i
understood
the
state
attorney
general
to
state
in
the
beginning
that
he
had
recently
filed
with
judge
layton
in
the
district
court
a
request,
according
to
particularized
need,
for
some
of
the
transcripts
of
some
of
the
witnesses
having
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
and
that
he
told
him
at
that
time
that
some
of
the
defendants
had
possession
of
those
transcripts
already.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
an
important
consideration
here
is
the
fact
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
the
particularized
need
test
or
so-called
particularized
need
test
is
frustrating
the
antitrust
enforcement
that
congress
has
mandated
in
the
hart-scott-rodino
act,
or
that
indeed
the
law
enforcement
efforts
of
any
county
or
state
are
somehow
being
frustrated
by
that
test.
all
that
test
is
is
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
need
for
that
particular
transcript
or
those
particular
minutes.
mr.
michael
b.
nash
no.
under
4f(b)
there
must
be
an
action
brought
for
the
state
attorney
general
to
request
the
materials
under
4f(b).
under
6--
mr.
michael
b.
nash
--in
6(e),
6(e),
the
disclosure
provisions
are
subject
to
there
being
a
current
judicial
proceeding
or
preliminary
to
a
judicial
proceeding.
it's
my
understanding
that
later
in
this
term
or
the
next
term
this
court
may
decide
that
question.
there
is
a
court...
baggett,
which
will
be
argued,
which
will
address
that
exact
question,
how
far
do
you
have
to
go
to
be
preliminary
to
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
michael
b.
nash
none.
if
i
can
get
back
to
the
question,
the
issue
here
is
solely
whether
or
not
the
attorney
general
is
entitled
to
grand
jury
minutes
automatically
under
4f(b).
the
issue
is
not
whether
or
not
he's
entitled
to
grand
jury
minutes.
in
this
case
the
state
attorney
general
sought
the
entire
grand
jury
minutes,
not
just
the
transcript
of
witnesses
who
testified,
but
also
the
documents
and
any
other
minutes
that
may
have
taken
place
before
the
grand
jury.
what
they
sought
was
wholesale
disclosure.
the
only
thing
that
4f(b)
says
is
that
disclosure
is
available
to
the
extent
permitted
by
law.
and
6(e)
since
its
promulgation
by
this
court
and
congress
in
1946
has
stated
that
that
governs,
6(e).
and
all
that
that
test
says
is,
tell
us
what
you
need
and
why
you
need
it,
and
we
will
then
balance
that
need
against
the
reasons
for
secrecy.
in
the
context
of
the
argument
that
was
presented
here,
it
is
assumed
that
under
4f(b)
that
the
request
will
not
be
made
until
after
the
criminal
proceeding
and
after
the
investigation
is
completed.
there's
nothing
in
4f(b)
to
say
that
the
state
must
wait
until
that
time.
so
that
if
your
honors
believe
or
should
decide
that
4f(b)
somehow
modifies
6(e),
there's
no
necessity
in
4f(b)
that
the
criminal
proceeding
have
been
completed
or
that
the
investigation
be
completed.
mr.
michael
b.
nash
exactly.
senator
abourezk
stated
exactly
that
in
answer
to
senator
hruska's
question,
and
he
said
there
very,
very
directly
and
very
frankly--
mr.
michael
b.
nash
--it
affects...
well,
the
antitrust
division
manual
spells
out
other
types
of
information
which
the
government
has
available.
it
spells
out,
for
instance,
that
before
immunity
will
be
granted
to
a
witness
in
an
antitrust
investigation,
that
there
must
be
a
proffer
made
by
that
witness,
that
that
proffer
must
be
reviewed
in
washington,
d.c.,
at
the
antitrust
department
headquarters,
and
that--
mr.
michael
b.
nash
--there's
a
great
deal
of
information
available,
and
we
should
not
consider
the
fact
that
only
19
pages
exist
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
b.
nash
--yes.
mr.
michael
b.
nash
no.
mr.
michael
b.
nash
well,
the
attorney
general
had
it
within
his
discretion
to
make
it
available
or
not
to
make
it
available.
mr.
michael
b.
nash
absolutely.
it
makes
it
a
mandate.
mr.
michael
b.
nash
i'm
not
sure
to
recognize
those
regulations,
but
it
mandated
the
availability
of
those
materials
to
a
state
attorney
general.
mr.
michael
b.
nash
despite
the
regulations.
mr.
michael
b.
nash
pardon
me?
mr.
michael
b.
nash
well,
i
don't
know
that
those
regulations
existed
beforehand.
there
is
some
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
dissatisfaction
of
various
state
attorney
generals
and
their
special
assistants--
mr.
michael
b.
nash
--it
does.
that
would
be
my--
mr.
michael
b.
nash
--pardon
me?
mr.
michael
b.
nash
well,
there's
no
reference
to
6(e)
in
the--
mr.
michael
b.
nash
--in
the
efforts.
in
the
congressional
efforts
there's
no
reference
to
6(e).
there's
no
intimation
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
was
somehow
dissatisfied
with
the
way
that
the
6(e)
balancing
process
was
working.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
congressional
record
that
congress
somehow
sought
to
change
6(e).
in
the
past
when
the
court,
when
this
court
or
congress
has
sought
to
change
grand
jury,
the
availability
of
grand
jury,
they
have
done
so
specifically.
in
rule
16
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
there
are
provisions
for
the
disclosure
of
generally
described
materials.
but
then
16
goes
down
and
specifically
makes
the
availability
of
grand
jury
statements
of
defendants
available.
prior
to
1970...
1966,
when
that
amendment
was
enacted,
promulgated
in
the
rules
by
this
court
and
sent
to
congress,
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
was
required
to
make
a
particular
showing
of
need.
congress
changed
that
specifically,
and
they
mentioned
grand
jury
materials
specifically.
when
they
changed,
when
they
enacted,
when
congress
enacted
title
18,
section
3500,
the
so-called
jencks
act,
it
spoke
generally
to
various
materials
that
were
available,
and
then
they
went
specifically
and
mentioned
grand
jury
materials
specifically.
so
that
what
you
have
there
is
an
indication
that
congress,
indeed
this
court
through
its
rule
promulgation
powers,
sought
to
affect
grand
jury
materials,
they
did
so
directly.
mr.
michael
b.
nash
i
think--
mr.
michael
b.
nash
--yes,
yes.
i
think
that
that's
the
position
that
they
take.
but
they
seem
to
ride
on
the
congressional
motivation
for
passing
4f,
that
because
congress
decided
that--
mr.
michael
b.
nash
--that's
correct.
that's,
i
believe,
their
submission.
in
a
chart
that
senator
abourezk
prepared
for
an
explanation
to
the
senate
of
the
differences
in
the
house
version
of
the
bill
and
the
senate
version
of
the
bill,
he
divided
the
categories...
or
he
divided
the
legislation
into
categories.
and
with
reference
to
grand
jury
materials,
which
he
specifically
listed
in
the
left-hand
column
of
his
chart,
he
said
that
the
house
version,
which
included
4f(b),
the
legislation
before
the
court,
had
no
comparable
provision
for
access
to
grand
jury
materials.
during
the
course
of
the
debate
in
the
senate
there
was,
in
the
words
of
one
commentator,
"fierce
opposition"
to
the
possibility
that
grand
jury
materials
would
be
disclosed.
that
opposition
consisted
of
senators
laxalt,
tower,
allen,
hruska
and
others,
and
they
voiced
strong
objection
to
the
question
of
availability
of
grand
jury
material,
not
to
whom
it
was
going
to
be
disclosed
but
to
the
fact
it
was
going
to
be
disclosed.
senator
allen
went
so
far
as
to
introduce
an
amendment
to
the
senate
version
of
the
bill
that
included
4f(b).
that
was
defeated,
but
the
fact
that
he
went
to
that
effort
to
introduce
into
the
senate
4f(b)
and
was
an
objector,
a
strong
objector,
to
the
disclosure
of
grand
jury
materials
shows
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
distinction
between
investigative
files
generally
and
grand
jury
materials
specifically.
the
question
really,
in
dealing
with
any
change,
gets
down
to
the
importance
and
the
significance
of
the
grand
jury
as
a
body.
this
court
when
it
changed
rule
16
in
1966,
the
congress
when
it
enacted
section
3500,
dealt
with
that
concept
directly
and
specifically,
and
that
was
a
recognition
of
what
the
grand
jury
is.
in
the
staff
interview
that
the
antitrust
department
lawyer
might
have
with
a
potential
witness,
he's
probably
represented
by
counsel.
he
can
walk
out
of
the
room.
he
can
refuse
to
answer
a
question.
in
the
grand
jury
he's
in
a
secret
room,
literally,
with
24
or
25
strangers,
without
a
lawyer...
an
intimidating
sight
at
best.
and
he
can't
walk
out
of
that
room.
he
must
answer
the
question.
and
the
fact
that
congress
when
it's
changed
or
this
court
when
it's
directed
itself
to
grand
jury
has
done
so
specifically
is
a
recognition
of
that
distinction
and
that
difference.
mr.
michael
b.
nash
the
only
ones
that
know
what
the
government
possesses
is
the
government.
according
to
the
record
in
this
case,
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
briefs
in
this
court
they
supplied
the
state
attorney
general
what
they
describe
as
19
pages.
after
filing
of
the
briefs
by
respondents
in
this
case,
which
called
into
question
first
of
all
whether
or
not
the
government
had
made
available
to
the
state
all
the
materials
they
might
have,
two
or
three
more
pages
were
made
available
to
the
state
attorney
general.
there
are
materials
which
would
normally
be
available...
staff
interviews.
when
the
government
says
that
primarily
the
grand
jury
is
used
to
investigate
antitrust
offenses,
they
point
to
a
comment
by
assistant
attorney
general
kauper
in
1975
that
they
don't
use
the
fbi
in
these
cases,
they
use
staff
interviews.
well,
those
staff
interviews
are
discoverable.
what
about
economic
expertise
that
might
not
be
available
to
the
states
but
is
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states?
that
would
be
available.
various
analyses
of
antitrust
problems
would
be
available.
all
kinds
of
materials
are
available.
the
government
says
in
the
antitrust
division
manual
that
it
retains
discretion
to
determine
in
some
cases
whether
some
of
those
materials,
which
are
clearly
within
the
definition
of
investigative
files
and
other
materials,
that
they
retain
the
discretion.
mr.
michael
b.
nash
yes.
4(b)
was
enacted
in
1976
and
the
manual
was
published,
i
believe,
in
august
1979.
mr.
michael
b.
nash
they
may
allow
them
certainly
some
discretion,
and
there
are
areas
that
readily
come
to
mind...
the
confidential
informant,
this
court's
decision
in
roviaro.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
they
can't
on
the
one
hand
say,
we
only
gave
them
19
pages
so
congress
must
have
meant
grand
jury
materials,
and
then
on
the
other
hand
not
identify
what
they
didn't
give
them,
because
there
was
no
identification
that,
wait
a
minute,
we're
withholding
some
stuff
to
the
extent
permitted
by
law.
they
said
they
gave
them
everything.
the
fact
is
that
after
respondents'
brief
was
filed,
that
at
least
two
or
three
more
pages,
according
to
the
state
of
illinois'
reply
brief,
were
made
available
to
them
in
september
of
this
year.
but
there's
no...
our
system
of
justice
is
based
on
an
adversary
system,
and
i
don't
think
that
between
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
you
have
this
adversary
flavor.
i
know
there
was
a
question
earlier,
but
truthfully,
according
to
the
manual...
and
i
don't
know
who
looked
at
that
beforehand
amongst
the
state
of
illinois
lawyers...
there
were
some
materials
that
the
government
says
in
the
manual
they
retain
the
discretion
to
give
or
not
to
give.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
of
illinois
should
pursue
that
before
saying
to
this
court,
you
should
include
grand
jury
materials
in
this
general
phrase
because
we
only
got
19
pages.
i
think
that
the
important
point
to
be
made
when
you
get
down
to
the
nitty-gritty,
as
they
say,
is
there
is
a
distinction
between
grand
jury
materials
and
other
materials.
there
is
a
distinction
and
there
is
a
uniqueness
about
the
grand
jury
system
and
the
institution
of
the
grand
jury,
and
when
congress
or
this
court
have
dealt
with
that
question
they
have
dealt
with
it
specifically,
not
by
implication.
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
government
would
have
this
court
believe
that
merely
because
the
congress
passed
legislation
which
was
directed
at
antitrust
violators
and
authorized
the
filing
of
parens
patriae
actions
which
had
previously
not
been
allowed,
that
that
was
an
indication
that
6(e)
was
to
be
changed.
when
you
get
to
the
question
of
changing
6(e),
you
get
to
all
sorts
of
other
questions
which
4f
does
not
address
itself
to.
there
is
nothing
in
4f
to
indicate
a
congressional
dissatisfaction
with
the
way
that
the
court's
discretion
is
working.
there
is
nothing
in
4f
to
determine
that
the
courts
in
determining
the
amount
of
disclosure,
the
time
of
disclosure,
and
the
conditions
of
disclosure,
as
the
rule
enunciates,
is
somehow
inadequate
or
is
somehow
frustrating
the
antitrust
efforts
of
the
state
of
illinois.
and
this
court
should
not
adopt
that
position,
that
congress
by
implication,
without
any
reference
to
grand
jury
at
all,
changed
the
law.
indeed,
the
reference
is
the
opposite.
senator
abourezk's
comment
stating
that
materials
could
not
be
turned
over
absent
a
court
order,
that
the
only
materials
that
could
be
turned
over
under
4f(b)
were
those
that
had
been
provided
the
government
voluntarily...
those
are
his
words.
those
are
the
words
that
he
used
to
silence
the
critics
of
the
disclosure
of
grand
jury
materials,
senator
hruska,
senator
allen,
senator
laxalt,
and
senator
tower
and
others.
thank
you.
