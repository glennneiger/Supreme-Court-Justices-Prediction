mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
4f(b)
of
the
hart-scott-rodino
antitrust
improvement
act
embodies
a
congressional
determination
that,
in
order
to
promote
state-sponsored
litigation
as
a
vital
aspect
of
national
antitrust
enforcement
policy,
the
united
states
attorney
general
should
to
the
full
extent
permitted
by
law
disclose
to
the
states
any
investigative
files
or
other
materials
that
are
or
may
be
relevant
or
material
to
a
potential
state
antitrust
enforcement
action.
notwithstanding
this
evident
policy,
evident
congressional
policy
of
disclosure,
the
court
below
declined
to
allow
the
state
of
illinois
access
to
5500
pages
of
grand
jury
transcripts
that
are
relevant
to
two
class
action
lawsuits
filed
by
the
state
under
sections
4
and
5
of
the
clayton
act.
it
did
so
based
on
two
propositions:
first,
it
doubted
whether
section
4f(b)
included
grand
jury
materials
in
the
possession
of
the
attorney
general;
and
second,
it
concluded
that
the
statute
had
no
impact
on
its
balancing
test
under
rule
6(e)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
as
to
whether
it
should
allow
those
materials
to
be
used
in
another
judicial
proceeding.
neither
proposition,
we
believe,
is
sound.
section
4f(b)
by
its
clear
terms
reaches
any
investigative
files
or
other
materials
within
the
possession
of
the
attorney
general.
these
words,
if
they're
given
their
ordinary
contemporary
common
meaning,
clearly
reach
and
include
grand
jury
materials.
respondents
contend--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--exactly.
rule
6(e)
by
the
express
terms,
express
provision
of
rule
6(e),
commits
grand
jury
materials
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general.
those
grand
jury
materials
will
always
be
in
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
by
the
express
provisions
of
rule
6(e).
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
i'm
not
aware
that
that
is
cited
in
the
briefs.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
rule
6(e).
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
it's
rule
6(e)(1)
under
"recording
of
proceedings".
it
says:
"the
recording
or
reporter's
notes
or
any
transcript
prepared
therefrom
shall
remain
in
the
custody
or
control
of
the
attorney
for
the
government
unless
otherwise
ordered.
"
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
he
isn't.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly,
he
is
the
custodian.
but
to
say
that
section...
that
because
he
is
mere
custodian
that
they
aren't
in
his
files
is
to
confuse
the
reach
of
4f(b)
with
the
standards
or
the
way
that
he
may
actually
disclose
those
materials.
the
second
ground
upon
which
the
court
below
based
its
decision
is
equally
unsound.
the
court
in
effect
concluded
that
section
4f(b)
has
no
impact
on
its
discretionary
determination
under
rule
6(e)
of
whether
it
should
release
those
materials.
it
therefore--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--justice
stevens,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
statute
necessarily
amended
or,
as
respondents
state,
repealed
rule
6(e).
we
believe
the
essential
nature
of
the
test
of--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--it
modifies
the
standard
as
applied
to
state
attorney
generals.
the
compelling
and
particularized
need
standard
we
believe
does
not--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--i'm
not
certain,
because
i
don't
know
whether
that
test
would
apply
to
private...
would
apply
to
a
public
official.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
i'm
stating
that
the
compelling
and
particularized
need
test
had
been
developed
and
applied
only
to
private
parties.
whether
or
not
that
particular
test
would
apply
to
a
public...
to
a
state
attorney
general
which
is
seeking
this
material
as
a
law
enforcement
official
for
a
public
use
or
to
further
the
public
interest,
whether
he
would
have
to
meet
that
test
without
section
4f(b),
i
am
uncertain.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
we
believe,
whatever
the
standard
would
be
appropriate
without
the
statute,
we
believe
that
section
4f(b)
is
a
weighty
congressional
policy
in
favor
of
disclosure
that
a
court
should
properly
consider
in
the
rule
6(e)
balance,
and
because
of
that
weighty
consideration
the
compelling
and
particularized
need
test
is
not
a
proper
standard.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
in
a
way,
although
it
doesn't
really
amend
the
standard.
the
standard
under
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
has
always
been
a
balancing
test.
you
balance
the
need
for
disclosure
against
the
interests
of
secrecy.
it
hasn't
amended
that.
all
it
has
done
is
demonstrate...
is
create
a
congressional
declaration
of
policy.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
congress
was
clearly
aware
that
rule
6(e)
existed.
a
statement
that
is
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
respondents
is
a
statement
of
senator
abourezk
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
where
he
replied
that
the
attorney
general
can't
turn
over
materials
on
a
mere
request.
the
senate
was
clearly
aware
that
there
was
a
rule
6(e).
while
there
may
not
have
been
extensive
discussion
of
it,
congress
was
clearly
aware,
and
yet
the
house
report
nevertheless
stated
that
these
materials
were
to
be
turned
over
unless
they
were
specifically
prohibited.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
clear...
that's
a
fair...
the
court
below
threw
out,
as
we
said,
rule...
or
section
4f(b)
and
failed
to
take
it
in
consideration
in
its
balancing
test
under
rule
6(e).
we
believe
that
the
two
provisions
must
be
read
in
harmony
and
there
is
a
way
to
do
so.
in
passing
on
a
state's
request
for
grand
jury
material
under
rule
6(e),
a
court
should
not
utilize
the
compelling
and
particularized
need
test
because
this
fails
to
give
significant
weight
to
the
congressional
determination
that's
inherent
and
embodied
in
section
4f(b).
section
4f(b)
represents
congress'
dual
determination
that:
one,
state
antitrust
enforcement
actions
are
vital
to
the
national
antitrust
enforcement
policy;
and,
two,
full
disclosure
and
cooperation
of
federal
investigatory
files
is
essential
to
aid
the
states
in
performing
this
function.
it's
important
to
realize
that
the
very
most
significant
and
indeed
probably
the
only
useful
parts
of
our
antitrust
investigatory
files,
our
criminal
antitrust
investigatory
files,
are
included
in
the
grand
jury
materials.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
the
civil
investigative
demands
are
still
used
only
for
civil
investigations.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
that
would
be
voluminous,
yes.
but
the
grand
jury,
the
antitrust
grand
jury,
is
used
in
criminal
matters.
the
cid
is
not.
so
when
the
state
requests
information
regarding
a
criminal
investigation,
it
still
would
be
grand
jury
material
and
not
cid
material.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
right.
but
another
provision
of
the
hart-scott-rodino
act
under
title
i
makes
cid
materials...
they're
only
disclosable
with
consent
of
the
party.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
it
could
be
a
lot
of
material.
moreover,
not
only
does
the
standard
fail
to
recognize
the
weighty
congressional
policy
in
favor
of
disclosure,
but
as
stated
it
was
developed
and
applied
by
this
court
solely
to
requests
by
private
parties.
a
request
under
the
auspices
of
section
4f(b)
is
not
made
by
a
private
party,
but
by
a
state
law
enforcement
official,
who
congress
has
found
to
be
an
ideal
and
effective
spokesman
for
the
public
in
antitrust
matters.
moreover,
any
concerns
regarding
possible
abuse
or
misuse
of
grand
jury
materials
in
this
context
must
be
mooted,
because
the
attorney
general
himself
is
a
law
enforcement
official,
well
aware
of
the
crucial
role
the
grand
jury
plays
in
our
criminal
justice
system.
a
proper
consideration
of
the
concerns
and
policies
furthered
by
both
section
4f(b)
and
rule
6(e)
would
lead
the
court
to
adopt
the
following
standard.
at
the
conclusion
of
a
criminal
proceeding,
a
state
under
the
auspices
of
section
4f(b)
may
normally
obtain
antitrust
grand
jury
materials
on
a
showing
of
relevancy,
provided
that
a
continued
interest
in
grand
jury
secrecy
is
not
shown
to
prevail
in
the
particular
case.
without
sacrificing
either,
this
standard
gives
full
credence
to
the
interests
and
policies
protected
by
both
section
4f(b)
and
rule
6(e).
the
standard
allows
the
state
to
obtain
the
vast
majority
of
useful
materials
in
the
file,
thus
furthering
the
policy
inherent
in
section
4f(b).
it
does
so,
moreover,
without
unduly
impinging
on
the
interests
protected
by
rule
6(e).
as
we've
stated,
rule
6(e)
is
a
balancing
test.
section
4f(b)
is
a
weighty
consideration
on
the
need
for
disclosure
side
of
that
balancing
test.
moreover,
this
court
has
made
very
clear
in
its
prior
precedents
that
as
the
need
for
secrecy
decreases,
the
justification
a
party
must
show
to
obtain
disclosure
decreases
also.
at
the
conclusion
of
criminal
proceedings,
the
only
interests
that
remain
are
protection
of
the
innocent
accused
and
the
functioning
of
future
grand
juries.
while
these
are
weighty
considerations,
they
do
not
compel
nondisclosure
in
this
context
because
disclosure--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--which
government
would
want
to
bring
a
civil
action?
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
the
united
states
could
use
the
grand
jury
materials
in
a
civil
action,
in
this
court's
prior
decision
in--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--it's
possible
that
would
be
a
consideration,
but
our
current
position
is
that
we
would
fully
cooperate
and
turn
over
materials
after
the
conclusion
of
the
criminal
proceeding,
notwithstanding
that
we
had
a
parallel
civil
action.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
there
can
be
strictures
on
their
use
imposed
and
protective
orders
imposed
by
the
court.
for
example,
how
many
copies
can
be
given
to
the
attorney
general,
who
it
can
be--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--yes,
that's
commonly
a
requirement,
that
it
has
to
be
returned.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
to
who,
who
within
his
own
office
he
may
disclose
it
to.
commonly,
it
cannot
be
disclosed
to
other
parties
in
the
litigation.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes,
they
could
be
used
for
taking
depositions.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
not
necessarily.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
it
would
become
public
at
that
point.
but
at
that
point
you
must
remember,
justice
white,
that
the
grand
jury
transcript
would
become
public
at
that
point
even
under
the
compelling
and
particularized
need
test,
because
at
the
time
you're
taking
a
deposition
you
could
show
compelling
and
particularized
need,
have
the
transcript,
and
use
it
in
a
similar
fashion.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
many
of
the
cases
demonstrate
that
that
is
sufficient.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
cases
from
this
court
indicate...
for
example,
this
case
in...
this
court
in
douglas
petrol
stops
cited
with
approval
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
in
sarbaugh,
state
of
illinois
v.
sarbaugh.
in
that
case--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--no,
but
if
you
read
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
continuing
line
and
progression...
for
example,
the
dennis
case
is
only
factually
distinguishable,
for
example,
from
pittsburg
plate
&
glass--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--because
the
state--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--now,
it
is
a
hassle
to
this
extent:
the
state
needs
this
information.
under
a
congressional
determination
they
should
have
this
information
at
the
very
outset
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
should
even--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--no,
we
don't.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes,
but
it
does
frustrate
congress'
determination
that
the
state
should
have
this
material
at
the
very
outset.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
requiring
the
state
to
meet
a
compelling
and
particularized
need
test.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
you
nevertheless
have
to
have
already
brought
a
legal
proceeding,
and
section
4f(b)
proceeds
on
the
assumption
that
the
states
will
have
that
information
before
they
bring
that
proceeding.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
you
mean,
could
we
make
that
and
then
turn
it
over?
i'm
not
certain--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--certainly
we
could,
pursuant
to
a
court
order,
we
could
certainly
make
those
kinds
of...
we
could
make
those
kinds
of
deletions
to
preserve
interests
in
grand
jury
secrecy,
certainly.
but
we
could
not
do
that
sua
sponte
on
our
own
and
then
turn
it
over.
it
would
have
to
be
under
the
direction
of
the
court.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
who
gets
notice
of--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--my
understanding
is
that
the
common
practice
under
rule
6(e)
is
to
notify
other
parties
involved,
who
are
implicated
or
involved
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
thank
you.
