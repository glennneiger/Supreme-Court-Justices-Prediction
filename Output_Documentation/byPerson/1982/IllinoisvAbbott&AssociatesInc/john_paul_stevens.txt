justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question.
you
say
that
the
6(e).
is
that
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
rule
6(e)
contains
a
particularized
need
requirement,
you
must
meet
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
involving
private
parties,
not
public.
if
it
doesn't
apply
to
public
parties
and
you
don't
have
to
satisfy
particularized
need
but
merely
generalized
need,
then
why
do
you
need
the
hart-rodino
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
tells
the
attorney
general
what
he
has
to
do
on
your
request.
and
you're
saying,
well,
you've
got
to
go
to
the
court
and
say,
we
think
6(e)
doesn't
prohibit
disclosure.
and
you
say
it
doesn't
prohibit
disclosure
because
you
don't
have
to
show
particularized
need.
so
why
don't
you
just
go
directly
to
the
court
without
even
citing
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
just
interested
in
grand
jury
materials
at
this
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
concede
that
without
the
statute
you
couldn't
get
these
materials
under
6(e)
without
a
showing
of
particularized
need?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
did
not
have
this
statute--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
you
merely
went
before
the
court
on
a
6(e)
motion,
would
you
have
to
show
particularized
need?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
still
haven't
answered
my
question.
if
there
were
no
hart-rodino
act--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--before
the
act
was
passed,
there's
an
open
question
as
to
what
showing
a
public
agency
such
as
the
illinois
attorney
general
must
make
under
6(e).
and
i'm
asking
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
there
were
no
hart-rodino
act,
could
you
get
these
materials
just
without
showing
particularized
need.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
true,
why
do
you
need
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
phrase
the
question
differently.
do
you
think
this
statute
changes
the
showing
otherwise
required
under
rule
6(e)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wilkins,
on
that
point,
do
you
agree
that
there...
what
is
your
position
on
my
question
as
to
whether
the
statute
amended
the
standards
under
rule
6(e)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
modify
the
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree,
then,
that
before
the
statute
was
passed
the
state
attorney
general
had
to
meet
the
particularized
need
showing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
part
of
your
brief
you
argue
that
congress
in
effect
adopted
pre-existing
law;
they
legislated
with
knowledge
of
what
the
law
was
with
respect
to
the
state
attorney
generals'
right
of
access.
and
now
you're
saying
even
you
don't
know
what
the
law
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
he
doesn't
have
to
meet
that
test,
then
he
doesn't
need
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
say
it
does
amend...
you
say
it
does
amend,
it
silently
amends
the
6(e)
standard
with
respect
to
state
attorney
generals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
the
words
"to
the
extent
permitted
by
law.
"
were
intended
to
make
a
change
in
the
law?
they
were
to
the
extent
that
congress
was
aware
that,
for
example,
there
is
rule
6(e)
that
permits
a
court
to
make
this
kind
of
a
balancing
determination.
you
certainly
couldn't
order
they
intended
to
change
a
rule
that
they
weren't
even
aware
of.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
it's
a
fair
summary
of
the
legislative
history
to
say
that
congress
felt,
well,
whatever
6(e)
requires,
it
still
requires?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wilkins,
is
that
true
after
the
passage
of
this
statute
would
authorize
the
civil
investigative
demands?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
if
you
accumulated
a
lot
of
information
pursuant
to
a
cid
and
you
got
the
consent
of
the
people
from
whom
you
got
the
information,
that
would
be
voluminous
material
in
your
files
that
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
statute
is
not
limited
to
criminal
material.
section
4f(b)
applies
to
all
your
files.
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
the
consent
of
the
party
providing
the
material.
but
if
you
get
that
consent,
all
that
material
would
then
have
to
be
turned
over.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
could
be
a
lot
of
material.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
in
a
proceeding
where
the
attorney,
state
attorney
general,
seeks
access
to
a
grand
jury
transcript,
who
gets
notice
of
that
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
i
assumed...
does
anybody
get
notice
other
than
the
united
states
department
of
justice
and
the
state
attorney
general?
justice
john
paul
stevens
grand
jury
witnesses
and
defendants
in
the
criminal
case,
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
involves
a
construction
of
a
provision
of
the
hart-scott-rodino
antitrust
improvements
act
of
1976.
one
provision
of
that
statute
provides
that
when
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
has
brought
an
action
under
the
federal
antitrust
laws
and
has
reason
to
believe
that
a
state
might
have
a
basis
for
a
similar
federal
action,
he
should
give
notice
to
the
state
attorney
general.
the
state
attorney
general
then
by
another
provision
in
the
statute
is
authorized
to
request
disclosure
to
the
state
of
the
investigative
files
of
the
federal
government.
in
this
case,
there
was
a
federal
grand
jury
investigation
in
illinois
of
price
fixing
in
the
construction
trades
and
the
attorney
general
gave
the
appropriate
notice
to
the
illinois
attorney
general
who
then
requested
access
to
the
grand
jury
transcripts
that
the
federal
government
had
generated
in
the
proceeding.
the
statute
says
that
the
disclosure
should
be
made
to
the
extent
permitted
by
law.
so
when
the
state
attorney
general
asked
for
the
material
the
federal
enforcement
officials
said
they
had
to
have
a
court
order
to
get
them
because
it's
required
by
rule
6(e)
of
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure.
they
said,
they
had
no
objection
on
the
merits
to
disclosure
but
the
procedure
had
to
be
followed.
the
state
attorney
general
then
filed
the
appropriate
petition
and
the
district
judge
denied
access
on
the
ground
that
they
did
not
make
the
showing
of
need
required
by
the
federal
rules.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
access
should
be
granted,
because
other
circuit
courts
had
rendered
conflicting
decisions.
we
affirm
unanimously
today
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
statute
only
allows
disclosure
to
the
extent
permitted
by
law
and
as
we
understand
the
federal
rules
and
the
applicable
facts
disclosure
would
not
be
permitted
in
this
case.
the
opinion
is
unanimous
but
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
o'connor
joined.
