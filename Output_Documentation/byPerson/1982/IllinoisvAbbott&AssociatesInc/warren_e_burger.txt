we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
the
case
of
illinois
versus
abbott
&
associates.
mr.
genovese,
you
may
begin
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
to
save
you
the
time,
save
the
state
the
time
of
calling
its
own
grand
jury,
calling
in
the
same
witnesses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
you
may
continue,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--could
the
federal
government
put
limits
such
as
this,
that
you
may
use
the
substance
of
this
testimony
but
you
may
not
disclose
the
name
of
the
person
who
gave
it?
or
could
they
delete
that
from
the
material
before
they
delivered
it
to
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
they
made
a
claim
and
some
showing
to
the
district
judge
in
camera
that
the
life
of
the
witness
might
be
jeopardized.
this
wouldn't
be
true
in
most
class
action
cases,
but
it
might
be
in
a
drug
conspiracy
case.

justice
warren

burger

the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren

and
