justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
you
have
used
the
word
"formal
adjudication"
i
think
three
times.
what
does
it
mean?
what
is
a
formal
adjudication?
what
if
he
just
says,
i
am
willing
to
enter
a
guilty
plea?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
judge
accepts
and
says,
but
i
won't
enter
judgment
until
the
two
years
runs
by.
is
it
still
a
formal--
--we
don't
think
that
congress
could
possibly
have
meant
to
have
that
matter.
let
me,
if
i
could,
give
you
a
hypothetical.
well,
but
your...
by
adjudication,
you
have
sort
of
a
special
meaning
to
adjudication.
you
don't
mean
entry
of
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if,
instead
of
his
accepting
the
plea,
the
judge
just
said,
file
the
plea
with
the
clerk,
and
come
back
in
two
years;
in
the
meantime,
you
know,
the
condition
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
would
you...
is
that
a
formal
adjudication
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
judge
says,
we
will
continue
the
case
for
two
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
to
draw
a
line
somewhere,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
his
lawyer
or
he
says,
i
am
willing
to
plead
guilty--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if...
because
it
was
just
my
wife's
gun--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
it
is
not
a
serious
thing,
and
i
am
just
willing
to
not
do
something
for
two
years.
it
depends
on
how
he
says
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
assuming
with
you
for
a
moment
there
was
a
conviction,
so
we
don't
get
off
onto
that
again,
supposing
that
the
man
convicted
appealed,
and
the
conviction
was
set
aside,
or
there
is
a
collateral
attack
on
the
ground
he
didn't
have
counsel,
or
he
didn't
plead
knowingly.
is
your
view
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
last
case,
that
then...
you
don't
read
the
statute
literally
as
applied
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
if
you
have
exactly
the
same
facts
you
have
here--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
instead
of
expunction,
the
man
comes
in
with
a
lawyer
and
files
a
corum
nobis
writ
or
something
like
that
and
says,
i
want
that
conviction
set
aside
because
it
was
really
my
wife's
gun
and
not
mine,
and
i
didn't
realize
that
it
had
to
be
my
gun,
and
therefore
set
it
aside.
you
have
exactly
the
same
facts
all
the
way
through,
but
they
set
it
aside
instead
of
expunging
it.
you
would
say
he
is
eligible
to
be
a
dealer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
turns
on
the
reason
for
the
state
action--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
vacating
the
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
is
equally
reliable
if
you
reverse
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
was
improperly
obtained
with
a
search
warrant,
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
kidnapping
whom?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whose
gun
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
are
the
contents
of
the
administrative
record
after
the
expungement
proceeding
is
terminated?
what
is
retained?
do
you
know?
does
the
statute
tell
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
supposing
you
had
exactly
the
same
procedure
you
had
here
in
iowa,
and
30
days
after
the
guilty
plea
was
accepted
and
there
was
a
conviction
entered,
the
defendant
came
in
by
his
attorney
and
moved
for
leave
to
withdraw
his
guilty
plea,
and
said
he
had
misunderstood,
just,
whatever
charges.
the
judge
just
said...
and
then
the
prosecutor
came
in
and
said,
we
do
not
oppose
the
motion,
and
the
judge
said,
leave
to
withdraw
plea
granted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
same
finding...
i
want
to
have
the
same
finding
that
you
got
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
an
expunction
is
not
a
finding
that
the
defendant
did
not
commit
the
crime.
that
is
crucial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
in
my
hypothetical,
the
same
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
two
years
later,
then,
just
instead
of
expunging,
he
came
in
and
said,
i
move
to
withdraw
my
guilty
plea,
and
the
judge
said,
motion
granted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
same
state
procedure
you
have
got
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
gives
the
judge
the
authority
to
allow
the
defendant
at
the
end
of
the
probation
period
to
withdraw
his
guilty
plea.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
just
says
in
his
motion,
i
want
to
withdraw
it,
and
the
prosecutor
doesn't
oppose
it.
do
we
have
that
kind
of
a
statute
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
mean
to
be
too
repetitious,
mr.
geller,
but
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
answer
to
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
really
would
be
helpful
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
take
my
hypothetical.
precisely
the
same
kind
of
judgment
that
we
have
here.
and
a
year
later,
a
lawyer
comes
in
and
files
a
motion
asking
leave
to
withdraw
the
plea,
and
on
the
ground
that
the
prosecutor
does
not
oppose
it,
and
the
prosecutor
says,
that
is
right,
the
judge
says,
we
had
a
finding,
you
start
out
the
same
way
you
did
there,
but
the
leave
is
hereby
withdrawn,
and
the
judgment
is
vacated.
what
is
the
government's
position
as
to
whether
he
would
be
disabled
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
able
to
answer
my
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
answer
is,
under
my
hypothetical,
he
would
be
disabled.
i
just
want
you
to
answer
it.
