federal
law
certainly
requires
that
we
look
to
the
state
law
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
a
felony,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
is
arguable
that
under
that
walton
case
it
isn't
a
felony
because
there
was
no
conviction.

mr.
lanier,
did
you
represent
the
client
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
before
the
administrative
law
judge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
did
not
make
the
oral
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
