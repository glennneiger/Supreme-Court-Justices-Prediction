chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
dickerson
against
new
banner
institute.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
geller.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
whether
one
state
has
deviated
greatly
from
another--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--so
that
a
man
could
get
a
federal
license
in
one
state--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--and
not
in
another,
in
the
adjoining
state.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
here
is
there
a
judgment
or--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--he
couldn't
place
him
on
probation--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--if
he
didn't
enter
a
judgment,
could
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
a
conviction
for
manslaughter
by
use
of
an
automobile
might
be
the
kind
that
the
secretary
would
have
discretion
to
waive.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
they
got
too
casual
about
the
exercise
of
that
discretion,
they
would
probably
hear
from
congress.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
lanier.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--are
you
suggesting
that
the
court
of
appeals
uses
the
term
"conviction"
casually
and
loosely,
without
regard
to
consequences
of
the
use
of
that
term,
having
a
statute
before
them
where
that
was
very
relevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
relieved
for
all
purposes,
under
all
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
we
or
are
we
not
bound
to
accept
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
as
a
determination
that
there
was
in
law
and
fact
a
conviction
in
iowa?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
we
have
to
read
the
opinion
again
and
see
whether
when
they
used...
the
three
judges
used
the
term
"conviction"
they
mean
what
lawyers
and
judges
usually
mean
by
the
term
"conviction".
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
congress
contemplated
that
this
national
legislation
should
be
subject
to
the
idiosyncracies
of
more
than
fifty
different
state
statutes,
and
twenty
odd
thousand
judges'
interpretation
of
that
statute
in
those
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
help
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
here
is
something
for
which
the
punishment
was
more
than
one
year,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
congress
meant
what
you
are
suggesting,
wouldn't
it
have
been
very
simple
to
add
a
few
words,
that
is,
unless
such
conviction
is
expunged,
or
unless
the
record
of
such
proceeding
is
expunged?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
had
to
be
a
proceeding
first,
did
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
charging
him
with
kidnapping,
was
it,
and
armed
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i
know,
but
the
charge
was...
that's
how
he
got
into
the
court,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
connection
with
the
kidnapping?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
facts
now.
forget
the
plea
bargaining.
he
was
charged
with
using
firearms
in
connection
with
the
kidnapping?
that's
the
charge
i
am
speaking
of.
that's
the
way
i
read
this
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i
know
it
was
dropped,
but
the
initial
charge
was
a
charge
of
kidnapping
using
a
firearm.
is
that
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
tell
me
what
is
the
charge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
new
charge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
his
plea
then
was
an
admission
that
whatever
he
did,
whether
you
call
it
kidnapping
or
whatever,
whatever
the
offense
was,
it
was
accomplished
by
him
by
the
use
of
a
firearm.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
are
we
entitled
to
assume
on
this
record
that
whatever
he
did
that
led
to
the
charge
of
kidnapping,
he
did
it
at
a
time
when
he
had
a
firearm
on
his
person
or
in
his
possession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
geller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
those
facts
and
the
hypothesized
statute
aren't
present
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
justice
blackmun
has
two
--
the
judgments
and
opinions
in
two
cases
to
announce.
