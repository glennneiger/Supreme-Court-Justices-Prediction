justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
geller,
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
particular
respondent
was
convicted
before
us?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
we
will
have
to
wait,
then,
to
hear
respondent's
argument--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--to
see
if
he
urges
that
as
an
alternate
ground
for
affirmance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
statement
there
really
subsumes
the
issue
of
conviction
velno,
doesn't
it?
the
statement
you
just
made?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
prefer
to
discuss
the
issue
of
conviction
velno
now
or
in
rebuttal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
strikes
me
as
a
rather
strange
proposition
for
the
government
to
argue,
unless
you
simply
mean
that
it
is
a
federal
question
and
federal
law
refers
to
the
laws
of
the
several
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
one
would
doubt
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
a
statute
that
congress
passed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
question
is,
how
did
congress
intend
that
the
meaning
of
the
word
be
sought?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
felony
definition
certainly
could
embrace
such
deviations,
and--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
arizona,
it
is
a
felony
to
steal
more
than
$50
worth
of
citrus.
now,
i
dare
say
that
probably
isn't
a
felony
in
most
other
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
that
there
was
a
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
page
is
that
on
in
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
page
3-a,
i
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
correct
to
think
that
under
925(c)
the
secretary
may
not
grant
relief
if
the
crime
in
question
is
one...
is
one
involving
the
use
of
a
firearm
or
other
weapon?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
might
happen
in
any
number
of
ways,
mr.
geller,
and
certainly
some
of
which
congress
couldn't
prevent.
what
if
you
knew
of
a
particular
metropolitan
jurisdiction
where
the
state
prosecuting
attorney
didn't
happen
to
like
the
federal
firearms
act,
and
so
every
time
he
had
somebody
on
a
felony
that
involved
firearms,
he
would
take
a
plea
to
a
misdemeanor
in
order
to
let
the
guy
off?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
used
the
word
"convicted".
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
secretary
can
grant
relief,
can't
he,
for
a
triple
first
degree
murder
punishable
by
death
if
it
was
committed
with
a
knife.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
spends
a
lot
of
his
waking
hours
passing
on
these
applications?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
lanier,
does
that
mean
you
are
retreating
from
the
position
you
took
in
your
brief?
this
is
your
brief,
the
red
one,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
page
14,
in
your
summary
of
argument,
where
you
say
in
the
first
short
full
paragraph
on
the
page,
"the
ruling
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed
because
there
never
was
a
conviction.
"
do
you...
is
that
a
statement
of
your
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
you
do
assert
that,
quite
apart
from
the
fourth
circuit's
ruling
on
expunction,
there
never
was
a
conviction
under
the
statute
in
the
first
place.
is
that
correct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
case
orally
argued
to
the
fourth
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
by
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
boykin
was
attempting
to
categorize
guilty
pleas
in
a
strictly
technical
sense?
