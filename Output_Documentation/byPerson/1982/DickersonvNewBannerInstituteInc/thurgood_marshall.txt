justice
thurgood
marshall
--well,
suppose
the
court
had
said,
i
accept
your
plea
of
guilty
and
sentence
you
to
five
years
in
the
penitentiary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
doesn't
say,
i
find
you
guilty,
and
he
doesn't
issue
a
judgment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
sentence
would
be
the...
but
he
didn't
say
judgment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
happen
with
a
pardon?
the
same
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
same
thing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
expunged?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i...
i
want
to
ask
a
very
simple
question.
what
was
expunged?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
entire
proceeding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
have
made
the
same
argument
if
it
hadn't
been
expunged?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
used
"it"
deliberately.
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
what
would
prevent
you
from
arguing
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
you
were
entitled
to
a
license.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
hadn't
been
expunged?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
conviction,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
state
is
the
one
that
decides
today
he
is
and
tomorrow
he
is
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
so
the
state
decides
it.
the
day
before
the
state
expunged
it,
he
couldn't
get
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
day
after
it,
he
could
get
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
state
is
deciding
a
federal
statute.
you
just
said
that
the
state,
that
is,
through
the
judge,
had
decided,
and
i
think
you
used
the
words
"do
nothing".
now,
in
iowa,
can
you
put
people
on
probation
for
a
year
or
two
years
or
three
by
doing
nothing?
just
pluck
them
off
the
street?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
an
order
issued
at
the
end
of
his
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
in
the
record
any
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
it
rather
important
as
to
what
happened?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
rather
important?
suppose
the
judge
says,
i
find
you
guilty
and
sentence
you.
wouldn't
that
be
a
different
case
from
what
you
have
been
arguing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
don't
know
what
he
said,
do
i?
and
you
don't,
either.
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you.
may
i
ask
if
under
the
iowa
expungement
procedure
they
physically
destroy
the
records
of
the
proceeding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
excuse
me.
do
we
have
any
appendices
besides
that
in
the
petition?
i
don't
mean
these...
these
are
copies
of
brief
before
court
of
appeals.
i
mean
of--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--blue
binding?
well,
where
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
nine
copies?
i
just
don't
have
any.
that's
all
i'm
complaining
about.
well,
i
thought
there
was
a
motion
to
dispense
with
printing
the
joint
appendix,
and
that
was
granted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
ask
the
clerk
over
there.
could
i
see
it?
i
understand
there
is
nothing
up
here
now.
that
is
all
i
want
to
find
out.
has
a
record
been
lodged
with
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
it?
