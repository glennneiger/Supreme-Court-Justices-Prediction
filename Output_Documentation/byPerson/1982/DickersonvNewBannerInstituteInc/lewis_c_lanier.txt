mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
beginning
with
justice
rehnquist's
questions
concerning
conviction,
we
have
argued
in
the
brief
that
whatever
happened
in
iowa
was
not
a
conviction.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
yes,
your
honor,
on
the
basis
that
in
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion,
they
do
talk
in
terms
of
a
conviction,
but
in
other
portions
of
the
opinion
they
talk
about
a
temporary
disability
running
because
of
the
iowa
action.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
no,
your
honor.
we
did
not
raise
that.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
but
since
it
was
argued,
we
feel
that
we
should
have
an
opportunity
to
reply
to
the
conviction
element
of
the
case.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
the
fourth
circuit
did
in
their
holding
indicate...
go
away
from
the
term
"conviction".
granted,
they
did
use
the
term
"conviction".
they
did
tend
to
go
away
from
the
term
"conviction"
in
their
holding
that
whatever
happened
in
iowa
was
a
temporary
disability
that
was
relieved
upon
the
expunction.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
that
was
the
holding
of
the
fourth
circuit,
that
the
relief
was
unconditional
and
absolute.
under
that
reasoning,
i
think
it
would
be
relevant
to
go
to
the
iowa
statute.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
you
are
correct.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
a
statement
of
our
position
on
the
brief.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
that's
correct.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
which,
mr.
chief
justice,
seems
to
vary
a
great
deal,
adding
to
the
ambiguity
created
by
the
federal
act
and
the
use
of
the
term
"has
been
convicted".
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
your
honor,
i
believe
there
was
argument
at
the
fourth
circuit
that
it
was
not
a
conviction.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
mr.
justice
marshall,
what
was
expunged
was
the
record
of
the
iowa
deferred
judgment
proceedings.
we
would
resist
the
characterization
that
the
plea
offered
was
accepted
by
the
trial
judge.
the
iowa
statute
has
directed
toward
a
state
interest
in
not
evoking
the
criminal
process.
under
the
iowa
statute,
the
trial
judge
has
really
three
alternatives.
he
can
go
ahead
and
accept
the
plea,
sentence
and
fine,
either/or,
or
he
can
use
the
two
elements
under
the
iowa
code,
section
789-a.1.
he
can
suspend
sentence
and
put
the
defendant
under
a
probationary
period,
and
then,
after
the
expiration
of
the
probationary
period,
the
court
may
make
a
recommendation
to
the
chief
executive
of
the
state
for
an
expunction.
or,
he
can
take
the
least
punitive
element
of
that
statute,
and
he
can
defer
judgment
on
the
plea.
we
take
the
position
that
the
plea
was
offered,
that
the
judge
did
not
accept
the
plea--
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
--the
record
of
the
deferred
judgment
proceedings
in
iowa.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
i
think
that
congress
did
interpret
that
way
by
using
the
state
definition
of
the
sentence,
the
maximum
sentence,
to
trigger
the
disabilities
under
the
federal
act.
i
think
congress
definitely
contemplated
looking
at
the
state
law.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
looking
at--
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
--that's
correct.
the
act
also
looks
to
the
state.
if
the
state
classifies
an
act
as
a
misdemeanor,
state
classification
of
misdemeanor,
and
it
is
less
than
two
years,
then
it
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
federal
gun
control
act.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
congress
could
have
done
that.
some
of
the
circuits
have
held
that
the
express
exclusion
of
expungement
is
not
binding
in
the
arrington,
frier,
and
ferguson
decisions,
in
that
they
said
under
the
federal
youthful
offender
act,
the
expungement
portion
of
that
provision
will
not
toll
the
disability.
therefore,
we
hold
that
the...
it
is
our
position
that
when
you
look
at
those
circuits'
review
of
the
idea
of
expunction,
they
did
intend
it
not
to
impose
a
disability.
as
to
the
question
raised
by
the
government
in
the
situation
of
whether
or
not
there
has
been
any
determination
as
to
whether
this
kennison
is
a
particularly
risky
person,
the
iowa
statute
addresses
that
also.
before
the
iowa
trial
judge
can
impose
or
elect
to
give
the
deferred
judgment
proceedings,
he
makes
a
determination
whether
or
not
the
nature
and
seriousness
of
what
is
charged,
the
stability
of
the
person's
employment,
any
prior
record,
and
the
state
interest
in
what
will
effect
the
maximum
opportunity
for
rehabilitation
and
the
protection
of
the
community
at
large.
these
decisions
are
by
iowa
statute
required
to
be
considered
by
the
sentencing
judge
or
the
trial
judge.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
no,
your
honor.
i
think
he
would
be
under
a
temporary
disability,
much
like
the
federal
act
speaks
in
terms
of
being
under
a
temporary
disability
after
indictment.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
your
honor,
i
find
the
iowa
statute
there
a
little
bit
unique
in
the
criminal
concept--
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
he
was
still--
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
--yes,
he
was
disqualified
during
that
period
of
probation.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
your
honor,
we
take
the
position
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
actually
consented
to
the
probation
under
the
terms
of
the
iowa
statute,
and
that
iowa
has
spoken
in
this
term,
and
said,
we
don't
want
the
criminal
law
to
come
into
effect
in
this
particular
case.
the
legislature
has
authorized
it,
and
has
given
the
judicial
branch
through
the
trial
judge
the
authority
not
to
evoke
the
criminal
process.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
that's
correct.
and
the--
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
no,
justice
o'connor,
my
law
partner
represented
him
before
the
administrative
law
judge,
judge
travis.
now...
and
i
was
not
at
fourth
circuit
and
on
the
brief.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
at
fourth
circuit?
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
no,
your
honor.
no,
ms.
justice
o'connor.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
that's
correct.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
justice
marshall--
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
--no.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
because
the
expunction
was
an
unconditional
action.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
why
not...
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
arguing
that
the
expunction--
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
--if
it
hadn't
been
expunged--
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
--the
record
of
the
deferred
judgment
proceedings.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
no,
your
honor,
we
still
resist
the
fact
that
there
was
a
conviction.
counsel
for
the
petitioners
argue
there
was
an
adjudication
in
this
case.
we
find
no
adjudication
there.
there
was
a
decision
to
do
nothing.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
in
conjunction
with
the
defendant.
it
is
a
consensual
act
in
iowa.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
that's
correct.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
the
trial
judge
in
conjunction
with
the
defendant
elected
a
deferred
judgment.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
there
was
a
proceeding.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
the
kidnapping
charges
were
dismissed
prior
to--
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
--that's
correct.
he
was
charged
with
possession
of
a
concealed
weapon.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
the
result
of
a
plea
bargain.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
the
charge
of
kidnapping
was
dropped,
and
then
the
possession--
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
--that's
not
correct.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
he
was
initially
charged
with
the
only
charge
of
kidnapping.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
his
wife,
a
south
carolina
citizen
in
iowa.
they
dropped
the
kidnapping
charge,
and
then
charged,
not
as
a
lesser
included
under
the
kidnapping
charge,
but
then
charged
with
possession
of
a
concealed
weapon.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
a
new
charge,
which
was...
which
was
the
subject
of
the
negotiated
or
the
conditional
plea
in
iowa.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
mr.
chief
justice,
i
say
that
is
not
correct,
either,
because
there
may
be
a
difference
in
terms
between
use
and
possession.
he
was
charged
with
possession.
he
was
never
charged
with
using
it,
just
the
fact,
the
simple
fact
of
possession.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
it
was
his
wife's
gun
also.
he
was
offered
a
deferred
judgment,
not
a
suspended
sentence.
the
judge
would
have
sentenced
him
at
that
time.
we
take
the
position
that
boykin
went
a
little
bit
further
than
saying
that
a
plea
of
guilty
is
in
itself
a
conviction.
it
said,
all
that
remains
is
a
judgment
of
guilt
and
a
sentence
thereon.
we
submit
that
those
two
other
elements
of
judgment
of
guilt
and
sentence
thereon
are
absent
in
this
case,
and
they
are
absent
because
iowa
intended
them
to
be
absent,
because
iowa
intended
not
to
evoke
the
state
criminal
law
in
this
situation.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
yes.
in
the
car
that
he
was
using
at
the
time.
in
this
case,
it
appears
that
the
government
is
using
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
linity
in
reverse.
they
are
saying,
we
admit
that
we
have
to
trigger
the
federal
firearms
statute
through
the
state
criminal
statute,
and
we
will
only
invoke
it
or
we
will
invoke
it
to
impose
disabilities.
they
have
said
that
there
is
a
proceeding
under
the
act,
the
federal
firearms
act,
where
the
secretary
can
remove
the
disability.
in
iowa,
there
was
a
state
judge
determination
that
this
man
was
not
a
risky
person.
he
made
that
determination
and
elected
not
to
evoke
the
criminal
law
of
the
state
of
iowa.
he
did
that
because
the
statute
in
itself
says
he
has
to
consider
these
things
and
in
fact
put
on
the
record
why
he
elected--
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
--some
type
of
order
was
issued
that
was
not
a
judgment.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
order
is
in
the
record.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
i
am
sorry,
justice
marshall.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
absolutely.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
the
only
record...
the
record
of
the...
the
iowa
statute
compels
the
expunction,
it
does
not
specify
the
destruction,
of
the
deferred
judgment
proceedings.
there
is
a
record,
called
an
administrative
record,
that
is
kept
in
the
office
of
the
clerk.
that
administrative
record
is
kept
in
order
to
advise
the
court
if
there
is...
under
the
iowa
statute,
you
can
have
two
deferred
judgments
for
a
misdemeanor,
and
only
one
for
a
felony.
so
we
take
the
position
that
the
record
housed
in
the
clerk's
office
is
just
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
is
eligible
for
a
deferred
judgment.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
the
statute
does
not
tell
us
what
it
contains.
in
this
case,
there
appears
to
be
an
analogy
that
can
be
made
that
people
that
are
confronted
with
the
iowa
statute
come
in
and
go
out
of
a
disability
status.
the
fourth
circuit
has
held
that
from
the
time
of
the
granting
or
the...
the
granting
of
the
probationary
period,
that
kennison
is
disabled,
that
at
the
end
of
the
probationary
period,
under
the
deferred
judgment
statute,
that
that
probation
is
ended,
and
his
record
of
the
conditional
plea
of
a
deferred
judgment
is
expunged.
if
the
only
thing
there
is
is
offer
to
plea
under
the
deferred
judgment
statute,
and
those
proceedings
are
expunged,
we
submit
there
is
nothing
left
of
a
conviction,
and
that
administrative
record
retained
by
the
clerk
of
court
is
nothing
more
than
something...
the
equivalent
of
an
arrest
record,
which
we
would
submit
evokes
no
disabilities
under
the
federal
act.
the
state
statute
involved,
when
the
trial
judge
elects
to
use
the
deferred
judgment
as
opposed
to
the
suspended
sentence,
works
automatically.
petitioner's
brief
indicates
that
the
disabilities
are
not
automatic,
they
are
not
unconditional,
and
they
are
not
absolute
on
the
theory
that
nothing...
no
recommendation
was
made
by
the
trial
judge
to
restore
the
disabilities
imposed
or
to
restore
civil
rights
in
kennison's
case.
however,
that
is
not
necessary
under
the
deferred
judgment
portion.
the
statute
specifically
states
that
under
the
deferred
judgment
statute,
upon
discharge
from
probation,
if
the
judgment
has
been
deferred
under
789-a.1,
the
court's
criminal
record
with
reference
to
the
deferred
judgment
shall
be
expunged,
and
that
is
the
conclusion
of
the
case.
we
submit
that
the...
whatever
happened
in
iowa
was
not
a
conviction,
and
in
any
event,
upon
the
successful
completion
of
the
probationary
period
involved
in
the
case,
that
the
expungement
lifted
the
disabilities
under
the
federal
firearms
act.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
the
appendix
from
fourth
circuit
was
adopted.
it
is
in
a
blue
binding,
black--
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
--i
believe
that
the
appendix
from
the
fourth
circuit
was
submitted
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
that's
correct,
and
that
was
granted.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
that's
correct.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
yes,
the
record
has
been
filed.
mr.
lewis
c.
lanier
the
fact
of
the
expunction
has
been
addressed,
as
i
stated
previously,
under
ferguson,
frier,
and
arrington,
and
in
those
circuit
courts
the
court
has
held
that
the
federal
expunction
under
the
youthful
offender
act
effectively
lifts
the
disabilities
imposed
upon
the
federal
gun
control
act.
we
would
rely
also
on
those
decisions
in
those
circuits.
thank
you.
