justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
mooted
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
was
it
an
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
judge
had
to
do
something
to
justify
keeping
him...
keeping
the
gentleman...
under
his
control
for
a
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
present
this
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
way
of
passing
on
it
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that...
you
are
suggesting
affirmance
on
this
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
is
whether
you...
you
must
believe,
then,
that
under
our
rules
you
are
entitled
to
present
this
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
never...
you
didn't
suggest
to
the
court
of
appeals
what
happened
here
shouldn't
be
considered
a
conviction,
did
you?
you
didn't
make
the
argument
in
that
court
that
you
are
making
here.
did
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
a
license
could
have
been
issued...
would
he
have
a
right
to
have
a
license
the
day
after
his
guilty
plea?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
that
is
so,
he
must
have
been
convicted
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
during
that
period
of
probation,
at
least,
he
was
disqualified
for
a
license.
you
agree
with
that,
apparently.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
there
had
to
be
a
conviction,
didn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be
unique,
but
you
have
said
that
he
was
disqualified
during
the
period
of
his
probation.
justice
byron
r.
white
within
the
meaning
of
this
federal
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
had
to
mean
that
for
a
while,
anyway,
there
was
a
conviction.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
your
other
argument
is
that
even
if
there
was
a
conviction,
it
was
removed
by
the
expunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
has
just
been...
it
has
been
filed
here,
like
a
record.
the
original
record.
