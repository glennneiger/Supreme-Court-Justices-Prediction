mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony
in
state
court
and
who
therefore
is
disabled
from
dealing
in
firearms
under
the
gun
contol
act
of
1968
is
relieved
of
these
federal
disabilities
when
his
conviction
is
subsequently
expunged
under
state
law.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
he
was
convicted,
and
therefore
we
have
not
raised
that
question.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but
respondent
has--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
i
think
that
the
respondent
appears
to.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
he
was
convicted.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
am
not
sure
whether
the
respondents
raised
it.
since
we
had
won
on
that
issue
in
the
fourth
circuit,
we
did
not
consider
presenting
it
here,
and
never
inquired
into
whether
it
was
briefed
in
the
fourth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
seemed
to
assume
without
too
much
difficulty
that
kennison,
the
fellow
at
issue
here,
had
been
convicted
when
he
pleaded
guilty
in
iowa
state
court,
as
i
hope
to
get
to
in
a
minute,
as
i
briefly
explain
the
statement
of
facts
here.
david
kennison
is
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
directors
and
a
substantial
stockholder
of
the
respondent,
new
banner
institute.
in
1974,
he
was
arrested
and
charged
with
kidnapping
in
iowa,
and
pursuant
to
a
plea
bargain,
the
kidnapping
charge
was
dismissed,
but
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
charge
of
carrying
a
concealed
weapon,
which
is
a
felony
punishable
by
five
years'
imprisonment
in
iowa.
the
trial
judge
in
iowa
accepted
the
guilty
plea,
deferred
the
entry
of
judgment,
and
sentenced
kennison
to
probation.
kennison
was
then
allowed
to
leave
iowa
and
go
home
to
south
carolina,
where
he
served
his
period
of
probation.
at
the
end
of
the
probationary
period,
which
appears
to
have
been
one
year,
kennison
called
up
the
iowa
authorities,
announced
that
he
had
successfully
completed
the
term
of
probation,
and
he
had
not
been
arrested
during
that
period.
and
then
the
iowa
court,
under
the
iowa
expunction
statute,
automatically
dismissed
the...
released
kennison
and
did
not
enter
judgment,
ordered
his
criminal
record
expunged.
now,
a
few
months
later,
new
banner
institute
applies
for
three
licenses
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
order
to
deal
in
firearms
and
manufacture
ammunition.
new
banner
did
not
list
on
the
application
that
one
of
its
chief
stockholders
and
officers
had
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
and
these
three
licenses
were
issued.
shortly
thereafter,
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco,
and
firearms
learned
of
kennison's
iowa
conviction,
and
served
notice
of
its
intent
to
revoke
the
licenses.
after
a
hearing
before
an
administrative
law
judge,
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco,
and
firearms
found
that
kennison
had
been
convicted
of
a
disqualifying
offense
under
state
law,
and
that
kennison
had
the
power
to
direct
the
management
and
policies
of
new
banner
institute.
therefore,
the
director
ordered
new
banner's
licenses
revoked.
the...
new
banner
sought
judicial
review,
and
the
district
court
upheld
the
revocation
order,
but
the
fourth
circuit
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
that
kennison
had
been
convicted
when
he
pleaded
guilty
in
iowa
court
to
the
felony,
and
therefore
the
federal
firearms
disabilities
had
been
triggered
at
that
point,
but
the
fourth
circuit
believed
that
since
that
offense
had
been
expunged
under
state
law,
it
could
no
longer
serve
as
a
predicate
for
the
imposition
of
penalties
or
disabilities
under
the
gun
control
act.
therefore,
the
fourth
circuit
ordered
the
director
to
issue
the
licenses,
these
three
licenses,
to
new
banner
institute
under
the
federal
statute.
now,
the
bureau
revoked
new
banner's
licenses
in
this
case
under
the
provisions
of
section
923(d)(1)(b)
of
the
statute,
which
prohibits
the
issuance
of
a
license
to
anyone
who
is
disabled
from
transporting,
shipping,
or
receiving
firearms
or
ammunition
under
sections
922(g)
or
(h)
of
the
act.
sections
922(g)
or
(h)
in
turn
make
it
unlawful
for
an
person,
and
i
quote,
"who
has
been
convicted
in
any
court
of
a
crime
punishable
by
imprisonment
for
a
term
exceeding
one
year
to
transport,
ship,
or
receive
a
firearm
or
ammunition.
"
now,
it's
the
government's
position
that
kennison,
by
virtue
of
the
undisputed
finding
that
he
pleaded
guilty
to
a
felony
in
iowa
in
1974
is
a
person
who
"has
been
convicted"
within
the
meaning
of
this
section.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
believe
that
the
fourth
circuit
was
correct
in
finding
that
the
acceptance
of
the
guilty
plea
constitutes
a
conviction
for
purposes
of
sections
922(g)
or
(h).
the
question
that
we
presented
in
the
petition
is
whether
the
subsequent
expungement
of
that
conviction
under
state
law
for
reasons
having
nothing
to
do
with
innocence
or
legal
error
serves
to
remove
the
federal
disabilities.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
be
happy
to
discuss
the
issue
now,
if
you
would
like,
justice
rehnquist.
we
believe
that
the
fourth
circuit
was
correct,
and
that
the
question
of
what
is
a
conviction
is
a
federal
question.
it
doesn't
depend
on--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
we
think
it
is
a
federal
question,
that
it
is
the
intent
of
congress
that
governs
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
the
word
"conviction"
was.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
agreed,
and
what
we
think,
the
only
thing
that
makes
sense
in
line
with
the
purposes
that
congress
intended
to
accomplish
in
the
gun
control
act
was
that
a
conviction
means
there
has
been
a
formal
adjudication
of
guilt
of
a
serious
crime.
i
don't
think
congress
meant
to
have
that
question
depend
on
the
nuances
or
the
niceties
or
the
peculiarities
of
state
law,
whether
they
call
something
a
conviction
or
not.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
under
iowa
law?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
have
explained
in
our
reply
brief
that
iowa
law
is
somewhat
ambiguous
as
to
whether
they
would
consider
this
a
conviction.
the
iowa
supreme
court
would
consider
this
a
conviction
for
certain
purposes,
but
perhaps
not
for
others.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
it
may
well
be
that
for
purposes
of
imposing
punishment
or
granting
of
forgiveness,
that
iowa
law
would
not
consider
this
to
be
a
conviction
for
certain
purposes,
although
i
should
point
out
in
our
reply
brief
we
pointed
out
that
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
has
for
other
purposes
considered
the
procedure
just
like
the
one
that
kennison
underwent
a
conviction
for
other
purposes,
such
as--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it's
a
felony.
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
i
think
not,
because
it
is
not
a
question
of
a
felony.
congress
defined
the
term
"conviction",
and
it
has
to
be
a
conviction
for
an
offense
that
carries
a
maximum
punishment
of
more
than
one
year.
it
is
not
a
question
of
what
the
defendant
is
actually
sentenced
to.
i
think,
justice
blackmun,
you
might
be
right
that
congress
wanted
to
see
how
the
state
courts
actually
dealt
with
the
defendant
for
purposes
of
punishment
if
they
had
defined
the
word
"conviction"
to
mean
what
sentence
did
the
state
actually
impose,
but
they
didn't
do
that.
congress
defined
the
word
"conviction"
by
reference
to
what
was
the
maximum
punishment
that
could
have
been
imposed,
and--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
we...
we
obviously
didn't
make
an
exhaustive
study
of
iowa
law,
because
in
our
view
congress
couldn't
have
wanted
the
disabilities
of
the
act
to
turn
upon
such
formalities
as,
for
example,
whether
a
judgment
was
entered.
we
think
what
congress
meant
to
do--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
precisely.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
precisely,
precisely,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it
could,
justice
rehnquist,
but
we
don't
think
it's
likely
to.
we
think
that
there
is
some
common
understanding
of
what
are
serious
crimes,
and
virtually
every
state
deals
with
those
crimes
by
labeling
them
felonies.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but
there
are
fail-safe
mechanisms
in
the
statute
to
deal
with
that
situation,
and
i
hope
to
get
to
them
eventually.
if
you
have
a
situation
such
as
that,
congress
allowed
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
grant
relief
from
the
federal
statute.
but
what
we
think
congress
meant
to
do
was
to
set
a
federal
standard
for
what
is
a
conviction
for
purposes
of
imposing
these
federal,
these
important
federal
disabilities.
what
that
standard
is
is,
has
there
been
an
adjudication
of
guilt
of
a
serious
crime?
have
all
the
facts
been
found?
is
all
that
remains
to
do
imposing
some
level
of
punishment?
now,
what
level
of
punishment
the
state
decides
to
impose
for
its
own
purposes
is
really
irrelevant
to
the
disabilities
that
congress
wanted
to
impose
in
this
situation?
the
fact
that
one
state
may
decide
to
sentence
the
person
to
five
years'
imprisonment
and
another
to
expunge
the
conviction
is
relevant
only
to
state
law
enforcement
purposes,
not
federal
law
enforcement
purposes.
the
purpose
of
relying
on
the
existence
or,
as
this
court
said
in
lewis,
the
fact
of
a
conviction,
is
that
people
who
are
convicted,
who
are
found
guilty
of
a
serious
crime,
congress
believed
to
be
a
member
of
a
class
of
presumptively
risky
people,
people
who
should
not
be
allowed
to
deal
in
firearms,
unless
they
get
a
special
dispensation
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
now,
we
think
that
that
presumption
of
riskiness
attaches
when
there
has
been
a
formal
adjudication
that
the
defendant
committed
a
crime,
and
not...
it
doesn't
depend
on
what
happens
thereafter--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
that
if
the
plea
is
accepted,
as
it
was
here--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
exactly
right.
we
think
a
formal
finding
of
guilt
is
what
congress
meant
by
conviction.
all
that
remains
is
to
enter
some
form
of
punishment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
precisely
the
situation
that
i
was
going
to
address.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is.
that
is,
if
all
that
remains
is
to
see
how
the
defendant--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
would
have
to
know
a
little
bit
more.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
you
would
have
to
find
the
point
where
the
judge
has
actually
found
the
defendant
committed
the
elements
of
a
crime,
and
that
all
he
is
going
to
do
thereafter
is
to
determine
the
appropriate
punishment.
now,
you
could
have
two
states,
for
example,
one
in...
and
in
both
states
the
defendant
commits
the
exact
same
crime,
violating
the
exact
same
statutory
provisions,
and
in
state
one,
the
defendant,
as
you
say,
enters
a
guilty
plea.
the
judge--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--right,
the
judge--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
no,
it
doesn't
depend
on
how
the
defendant
says
that.
it
depends
upon
what
the...
if
the
judge
makes
a
formal
finding
of
guilt,
either
by
accepting
the
guilty
plea
or
by
accepting
the
jury's
verdict
or
by,
if
it's
a
non-jury
case,
finding
all
of
the
facts.
at
that
point,
we
think
there
has
been
a
conviction.
now,
as
i
was
saying,
you
could
have
a
situation
where
the
judge
accepts
the
guilty
plea
and
defers
the
entry
of
the
judgment
and
says,
i
am
going
to
just
watch
your
behavior
over
the
next
year
before
i
sentence
you.
you
can
have
a
second
case,
which
is
what
i
think
probably
happened
here
in
iowa,
in
which
the
judge
accepts
the
guilty
plea,
enters
a
sentence...
here
it
was
a
probationary
sentence...
and
at
the
end
of
the
year,
based
on
the
defendant's
conduct,
expunges
the
sentence.
it
seems
to
me
the
only
differences
between
those
two
situations
is
that
in
case
number
two,
the
judge
has
entered
a
formal
document
labeled
judgment,
but
in
either
case
there
has
been
a
factual
finding
that
the
defendant
committed
a
serious
crime.
both
defendants
would
seem
to
fall
into
the
presumptively
risky
category
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
passing
the
gun
control
act,
and
we
can't
imagine
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
treat
those
two
individuals
differently
for
the
purpose
of
imposing
federal
disabilities.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
here
there...
here...
yes.
here
the
defendant
was
placed
on
probation.
there
was
a
finding--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
exactly--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--absolutely.
the
judge
could
not
have
sentenced
the
defendant
to
even
the
probationary
term
unless
he
had
found
that
he
had
committed
a
crime.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
was
an
order
entered.
it
wasn't
labeled
judgment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
am
not
sure
that
we
should
have
what
congress
intended
to
accomplish
in
this
important
federal
statute
turn--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
assume
the
sentence
in
that
situation
would
be
the
judgment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't...
that's
exactly...
i
don't
think
that
congress's
important
purposes
here
turn
on
how--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--exactly.
he
had
to
find
that
he
had
committed
an
offense
under
iowa
law,
and
that
offense
under
the
iowa
statutes
is
punishable
by
five
years.
we
think
that
clearly
constitutes
a
conviction
for
the
purposes
of
922(g)
or
(h).
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
a
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
is
interesting
that
you
mention
a
pardon,
because
congress
dealt
with
a
pardon.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
congress
dealt
with
a
pardon
in
title
vii,
and
it
said
that
a
pardon,
if
it
specifically
announces
that
the
defendant
is
still...
is
to
be
allowed
to
engage
in
carrying
of
firearms,
serves
to
relieve
disabilities,
but
congress
did
not
say
that
in
title
iv,
which
is
the
statute
at
issue
here.
so
presumably
congress
did
not
want
to
allow
gubernatorial
parties
to
relieve
defendants
of
the
disabilities
imposed
by
federal
law,
yet
the
fourth
circuit
has
held
that
state
expungements,
which
may
be
less
of
an
indication
that
the
defendant
is
a
responsible
person
than
a
gubernatorial
pardon,
relieve
the
defendant
of
those...
of
those
important
federal
disabilities.
now,
i
had
hoped
to
get
into
a
discussion
of
some
of
the
statutory
provisions
in
order
to
show
the
court
that
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
is
clearly
inconsistent
with
congress's
intent,
and
i
am
not
going
to
have
time
to
discuss
several
of
them,
but
i
do
want
to
discuss
what
we
believe
perhaps
is
the
most
important
indication
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
incorrectly
construed
the
statute,
and
that
is
section
925(c)
of
the
act,
which
i
alluded
to
earlier.
congress
realized
that
not
everyone
who
was
convicted
of
a
felony
under
state
law
is
a
risky
person.
they
also
realized
that
it
would
be...
people,
even
if
they
were
initially
risky,
might
rehabilitate
themselves,
and
it
would
be
unduly
harsh
to
subject
those
people
to
lifetime
or
permanent
disabilities.
but
it
is
instructive
to
see
what
congress
did
in
that
situation.
in
section
925(c),
congress
delegated
to
the
secretary--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it's
in
the
very
back
of
the
brief,
in
the
statutory
appendix,
justice
rehnquist,
on
page--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
page
3-a.
let's
look
at
what
congress
did
to
deal
with
that
very
serious
problem.
congress
empowered
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
grant
relief
from
the
disabilities
of
the
act
in
selected
cases,
but
at
the
same
time
congress
restricted
the
secretary's
authority
in
a
number
of
significant
ways.
first,
relief
under
section
925(c)
can't
be
granted
to
anyone
convicted
of
a
crime
involving
the
use
of
a
firearm.
second,
before
relief
can
be
granted
under
section
925(c),
it
has
to
be
established
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
secretary
that
the
circumstances
regarding
the
applicant's
conviction
and
his
record
and
reputation
are
such
that
the
applicant
will
not
be
likely
to
act
in
a
manner
dangerous
to
the
public
safety,
and
that
the
granting
of
relief,
i.e.,
allowing
him
to
deal
with
firearms,
would
not
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
congress
wrote
that
right
into
the
statute,
and
the
secretary
must
make
this
precise
finding
after
an
individualized
inquiry
every
time
he
grants
relief
from
the
disabilities
of
the
act,
and
under
section
925(c),
whenever
the
secretary
grants
relief,
he
has
to
promptly
publish
notice
of
that
fact
in
the
federal
register.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
the
secretary
is
disabled
from
granting
relief
in
that
situation,
but
look
at
the
anomalies
that
would
arise
if
the
fourth
circuit
were
correct,
because
state
officials
would,
even
though
congress
carefully
circumscribed
the
power
of
the
secretary
to
grant
relief
from
the
firearms
disabilities
imposed
by
the
act,
state
officials
would
have
unfettered
discretion
to
accomplish
even
more
than
congress
authorized
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
do.
state
officials
could
grant,
by
granting
expungements,
they
could
grant
relief
from
the
federal
gun
control
act
even
for
people
who
are
convicted
of
a
firearms
offense.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
congress
obviously
had
to
bow
to
the...
to
certain
realities.
there
is
nothing
congress
can
do
about
that
situation,
but
congress
can
do
something
about
the
situation
in
which
defendants
were
convicted
of
serious
crimes.
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
here,
defendant
was...
pleaded
guilty
to
a
five-year
felony--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
i
understand.
well,
that
is
our
position,
justice
rehnquist,
and
it
is
the
view
also
of
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
don't
think
that
would
accomplish
congress's
purpose.
we
agree
with
the
statement
we
made
in
the
lewis
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
but
i
think
that...
i
mean,
i
think
that
is
perfectly
consistent
with
congress's
purpose
in
selecting
out
people
who
have
had
convictions
entered
against
them.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
is
relevant.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
it
is
extremely
relevant.
i
mean,
the
purpose
in
fixing
disabilities
on
people
who
are
convicted
is
that
the
fact
of
conviction,
as
the
court
said
repeatedly
in
lewis,
is
a
reliable
indicator
of
whether
that
person
is
presumptively
irresponsible
or
too
risky.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
may
also
be
constitutional
problems
in
imposing
disabilities
on
someone
who
has
had
his
conviction
reversed,
but
we
don't
have
to
reach
that.
we
think
simply
as
a
matter
of
congressional
intent,
the
fact
of
conviction
is
no
longer
a
reliable
indicator
of
riskiness
if
in
fact
the
defendant
has
had
his
conviction
reversed
because
of
some
legal
error
or
because
of
innocence.
at
that
point,
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
he
has
committed
a
crime,
but
expunction
is
quite
different.
expunction
assumes
that
the
defendant
has
committed
a
serious
crime,
and
the
state
for
its
own
law
enforcement
purposes
has
decided
to
engage
in
an
act
of
partial
or
complete
forgiveness.
the
question
is,
would
congress
have
wanted
the
states
to
forgive
federal
disabilities.
we
think
the
answer
to
that
on
its
face
is
probably
wrong,
but
it
is
certainly
wrong
when
congress
has
put
in
a
specific
forgiveness
provision
in
the
federal
statute,
section
925(c),
which
requires
a
cabinet
level
federal
official
to
make
an
individualized
inquiry
before
granting
relief
from
the
gun
control
act,
to
see
whether
the
defendant
is
in
fact
a
responsible,
reliable
person
who
should
be
trusted
with
a
firearm.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
absolutely.
in
fact,
the
secretary
granted
relief
in
800
cases
last
year
in
which
he
was
satisfied
that
the
person
in
question
was
not
risky
or
could
be
trusted
to
carry
or
deal
in
firearms,
but
as
i
said,
every
time
he
did
that,
he
had
to
publish
a
notice
of
that
fact
in
the
federal
register,
so
that
people
would
be
aware
of
what
the
legal
status
of
this
individual
is.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
he
could.
he
may
not
do
it,
but
congress
was
willing
to
entrust
that
decision
to
a
cabinet
level
federal
official
applying
uniform
federal
standards.
we
don't
think
they
were
willing
to
entrust
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
would
be
surprised
if
he
spends
very
much
time,
but
there
are
people
in
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco,
and
firearms
who
do
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
studying
these
applications
and
making
individualized
inquiries.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that's
right.
this
is
an
important
federal
statute.
the
court
has
remarked
on
that
many
times,
and
i
needn't
remind
the
court
of
the
history
that
gave
rise
to
title
iv
and
title
vii
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
act.
congress
was
not
cavalier
about
allowing
people
who
were
convicted
of
felonies
to
carry
firearms.
it
imposed
a
disability
on
these
people,
and
it
allowed
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
a
cabinet
level
federal
official,
to
remove
that
disability.
it
didn't,
we
think,
mean
to
allow
state
officials
using
unfettered
discretion
across
the
country
and
not
making
any
inquiry
into
whether
the
person
could
be
trusted
to
carry
a
firearm
to
relieve
the
disabilities
of
the
gun
control
act.
now,
i
just
want
to
make
one
more
point
before
i
reserve
time
for
rebuttal,
and
that
is
that
if
the
court
agrees
with
the
fourth
circuit,
if
it
says
that
effect
must
be
given
to
state
expungements,
then
it
is
going
to
have
to
confront
the
much
more
difficult
question
of
exactly
what
effect
is
to
be
given
to
these
various
expungement
statutes.
nearly
half
the
states
have
expungement
statutes.
they
are
a
bewildering
array.
they
are...
they
vary
in
almost
every
single
particular.
now,
when
a
state
convicts
someone
of
a
crime,
it
imposes
on
that
defendant
a
bundle
of
disabilities.
it
would
be
quite
bizarre
if
by
expunging
only
a
portion
of
those
disabilities,
federal
courts
were
willing
to
remove
the
disabilities
imposed
by
congress
under
the
gun
control
act.
therefore,
it
would
seem
that
there
would
have
to
be
an
individualized
inquiry
by
the
federal
courts
in
every
single
case
to
see
whether
what
remains
after
the
expungement
is
still
considered
a
conviction
for
federal
gun
control
purposes.
now,
this
would
be,
we
think,
chaotic.
it
would
lead
to
massive
confusion
in
enforcement
of
the
act.
no
one
would
know
what
their
legal
status
is
if
they
had
an
expunged
conviction.
the
fourth
circuit
here
masked
those
difficulties
by
calling
the
iowa
expungement
statute
absolute
and
unconditional,
where
we
think
that
is
plainly
incorrect
for
reasons
we
have
discussed
in
our
reply
brief,
but
even
if
it
were
true
in
the
case
of
the
iowa
statute,
there
were
dozens
and
dozens
of
other
expunction
statutes
out
there,
and
if
we
had
to
give
effect
to
those
expunction
statutes
under
federal
law,
the
situation
would
be
chaotic.
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
would
not
know
whether
he
could
grant
a
license
to
someone
who
had
an
expunged
conviction.
the
gun
dealers
would
not
know
whether
they
would
be
committing
a
crime
by
selling
a
firearm
to
someone
with
an
expunged
conviction.
law
enforcement
officers
would
not
know
whether
someone
with
an
expunged
conviction
would
be
committing
a
crime
by
carrying
a
firearm.
and
the
defendant
himself
would
not
know
what
his
legal
status
is.
we
think
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
allow
such
an
ambiguous
and
confusing
situation
to
occur
in
the
enforcement
of
an
extremely
important
federal
statute.
what
we
think
congress
meant
was
that
when
someone
has
been
adjudicated
guilty
of
a
serious
crime,
he
falls
within
the
disabilities
of
the
federal
act,
and
if
he
is
to
be
relieved
of
those
disabilities,
it
is
to
be
done
by
application
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
followed
by
public
notice
of
that
fact,
and
not
in
the
helter-skelter
fashion
that
the
fourth
circuit
seems
to
envision
involving
dozens
and
dozens
of
state
expungements
by
officers,
giving
no
thought
at
all
to
whether
the
person
should
continue
to
be
disabled
under
federal
law.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
one
or
two
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question,
iowa
doesn't
in
fact
destroy
the
record.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
does
not.
in
fact,
the
bureau
of
atf
found
out
about
kennison's
conviction
in
this
case
from
the
iowa
authorities.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would...
my
position
would
be,
i
think
the
government's
position
would
be
that
there
would
not
be
a
conviction
in
that
case.
the
plea
has
been
legally
set
aside,
vacated.
there
has
been
no
finding
that
the
defendant
committed
the
crime.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
i
don't
agree,
justice
stevens.
if
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
i
would
have
to
know
more
about
the
state
procedure
to
see
whether
this
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--if
there
is
no...
if
it
is
just
an
expunction,
if
there
is
no
finding
that
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
would
think
that
if
the
basis
for
the
relief,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
defendant
did
not
commit
the
crime--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
don't.
in
fact,
if
i
could
just
turn
for
a
second
to
the
case
we
have
before
us
before
my
time
runs
out,
because
there
is
in
fact
an
order
entered
in
this
case
by
the
trial
judge.
it
is
government's
exhibit
13,
which
i
think
the
court
will
find
in
the
record,
and
it
begins
by
saying
that
the
defendant
has
entered
a
plea
of
guilty.
it
has
not
just
been
offered.
the
judge
has
accepted
it.
and
under
cases
of
this
court
like
boykin,
i
think
that
a
guilty
plea
is
a
conviction
for
these
purposes.
there
is
no
question
here
that
the
plea--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
of
course...
of
course
not,
but
we
are
trying
to
categorize
what
congress
meant
by...
what
it
meant
when
it
used
the
word
"conviction".
we
think
it
was
using
it
in
the
same
sense
that
the
court
has
frequently
used
it,
such
as
in
kercheval
and
boykin,
a
formal
finding
of
guilt.
now,
the
sorts
of
questions
that,
justice
stevens,
you
were
asking
about
what
is
left
after
the
expungement,
and
justice
blackmun
was
asking
about
how
does
state
law
deal
with
this
expunction,
that
is...
those
are
the
sorts
of
questions
that
federal
courts
would
have
to
wrestle
with,
and
federal
administrative
officials
would
have
to
wrestle
with
day
after
day
in
enforcing
this
important
federal
statute
if
the
court
holds
that
state
expunction
provisions,
which
vary
wildly
from
state
to
state,
and
are
very
ambiguous
as
to
what
has
been
expunged,
what
is
the
basis
for
the
expunction,
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
that
finding
in
itself
wipes
out
the
important
disabilities
imposed
by
the
gun
control
act,
we
don't
think
congress
could
ever
have
intended
that,
especially
in
light
of
section
925(c).
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
give
a
somewhat
more
extended
answer
than
one
word.
on
one
pole,
we
have
the
lewis
situation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
on
the
other
pole,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
the
kennison
situation,
where
there
is
no
question
that
the
conviction
was
expunged
for
reasons
wholly
unrelated
to
guilt.
now,
justice
stevens,
you
have
just
presented
a
hypothetical
which
is
in
between
those
two.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
make
a
further
inquiry.
i
would
have
to
have
facts
that
are
not
included
in
your--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
the
answer
is
that
if
the
judge
has
not
made
a
finding
that
the
defendant
did
not
commit
the
crime,
then
there
has
been
a
conviction.
he
has
been
convicted
under
section
922(c).
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that's
my
answer,
but
i'd
like
to
know
more
of
the
facts
before
i
commit
the
government
to
that
position.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
are
not
what
the
court
has
before
us
here
by
any
means.
thank
you.
