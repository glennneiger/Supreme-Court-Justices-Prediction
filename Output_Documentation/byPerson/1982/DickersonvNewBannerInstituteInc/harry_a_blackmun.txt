but
how
do
you
tell
whether
it
is
a
formal
adjudication?
do
you
know,
mr.
geller,
what
the
situation
would...
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
do
you
know
what
the
situation
would
be
under

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
know
the
case
of
iowa
against
walton?
it
is
not
cited
in
your
brief
nor
in
your
opposition's
brief.
let
me
read
what
the
iowa
court
said.
this
is
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
not
the
court
of
appeals,
and
this
is
iowa
law.
"a
deferred
judgment
order
cannot
serve
as
proof
of
a
felony
conviction
in
the
prosecution
of
a
section
724.26
charge.
"
that's
the
iowa
comparable
provision.
"the
record
necessarily
has
to
disclose
the
revocation
of
probation
and
the
ultimate
conviction.
"
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
the
opposite
of
your
position
here
under
state
law.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
give
you
the
citation
of
the
walton
case,
and
if
either
of
you
have
any
comments,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
you
could
submit
them
after
the
argument.
i
am
surprised
that
your
opposition
hasn't
cited
it.
it
is
311
northwestern
113,
and
the
jump
cite
is...
i'm
sorry.
311
northwestern
2nd
110,
and
the
jump
cite
or
page
is
112.
and
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
headnotes,
strangely
enough.

against

institute.
this
case
comes
to
us
by
way
of
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit.
title
iv
of
the
gun
control
act
of
1968,
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
person
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony
to
engage
in
the
business
of
dealing
in
firearms
without
a
license.
the
act
also
provides
that
a
license
shall
be
denied
to
an
applicant
corporation
if
a
person
with
power
to
direct
the
management
of
that
corporation
is
a
convicted
felon.
the
respondent's
chairman,
a
man
named
kennison,
who
is
a
resident
of
south
carolina
pleaded
guilty
in
iowa
--
in
an
iowa
state
court
to
a
charge
of
carrying
a
concealed
handgun.
under
iowa
law
this
was
a
felony.
pursuant
to
an
iowa
statute
however,
the
iowa
court
deferred
entry
of
formal
judgment
and
placed
mr.
kennison
on
probation.
after
the
completion
of
his
probation
term,
he
was
discharged
pursuant
to
another
state
statute
and
his
record
with
respect
to
the
deferred
judgment
was
expunged.
a
federal
license
that
had
been
issued
to
the
respondent
corporation
as
a
firearms
dealer
was
revoked
when
the
federal
firearms
bureau
learned
of
the
iowa
proceeding
against
mr.
kennison.
the
federal
district
court
upheld
that
revocation,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
although
kennison
had
been
convicted
of
an
offense
that
triggered
firearms
disability,
that
fact
could
not
serve
as
a
predicate
for
a
gun
control
act
violation
or
a
license
revocation
because
the
conviction
had
been
expunged
under
the
iowa
deferred
judgment
procedure.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
firearms
disabilities
imposed
by
the
gun
control
act
apply
to
kennison
and
were
not
removed
by
the
expunction
of
the
record
of
his
guilty
plea
to
the
concealed
weapon
charged.
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
disqualifying
crime
and
its
notation
by
a
state
court,
followed
by
a
sentence
of
probation,
is
equivalent
we
think
within
the
language
of
the
act
to
being
convicted.
iowa's
expunction
provisions
did
not
nullify
the
conviction
for
purposes
of
a
federal
statute.
a
rule
that
would
give
effect
to
expunction
under
varying
state
statutes
would
seriously
hamper
the
effective
enforcement
of
the
act.

rehnquist
