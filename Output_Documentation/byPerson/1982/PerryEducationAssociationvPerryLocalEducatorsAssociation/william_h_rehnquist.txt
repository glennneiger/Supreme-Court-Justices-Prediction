justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
possible
to
say,
mr.
chanin,
whether
any
group
besides...
is
it
the
plea
is
your
group's
rival?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
were
affirmatively
excluded
in
the
sense
of
having
sought
access
and
been
denied
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
lead
to...
can
you
then
generalize
as
to
what
the
school
district's
standard
for
access
to
these
mailboxes
was,
or
are
you
left
pretty
much
to
having
several
points
and
trying
to
figure
out
where
the
line
goes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chanin,
state
law
just
allows
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
during
the
insulation
period
state
law
doesn't
require
unilateral
access.
only
it
simply
permits
it
to
be
bargained.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
even
if
the
school
board
weren't
all
that
happy
to
have
either
union
in
there,
i
suppose
it
has
some
interest
in
keeping
use
of
the
teachers'
mailboxes
by
outside
groups
at
a
minimum.
you
have
forced
it
in
effect
to
give
you
access,
but
perhaps
it
would
just
as
soon
limit
it
as
much
as
it
could.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
course
of
the
bargaining
and
in
the
development
of
this
rule,
was
your
claim
in
the
bargaining,
your
demand,
that
your
organization
have
access
and
your
rival
organization
not
have
access,
or
simply
that
your
organization
have
access--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
really
before
us?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
took
it
all
that
the
solicitor
general
might
have
wanted
was
a
footnote
in
the
opinion
disavowing
any--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
an
indiana
school
district
adopted,
outside
of
the
labor
context,
a
regulation
saying
that
no
black
armbands
shall
be
worn
in
the
school
by
the
students.
would
you
say
that
was
not
appealable
here
under
the
same
circumstances?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
the
school
district
held
intense
hearings
and
heard
all
sorts
of
groups
on
this
black
armband
question,
and
one
group
demanded
one
thing
and
one
demanded
another
thing,
and
the
school
board
finally
came
out
and
said,
this
is
the
way
we
resolve
it.
is
that
all
that
different
from
this?
i
mean,
it's
the
school
board
that
finally
grants
the
access,
not
the
union.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
federal
contract
bar
rule
for
a
period
of
whatever
it
is
now
is
certainly
imposed
just
across
the
board,
without
regard
to
whether
there
might
be
disharmony
or
friction
in
that
particular
employment
situation.
do
you
think
that
the
state
or
the
school
board
in
this
case
would
be
unjustified
in
saying,
we're
not
going
to
look
into
individual
examples
of
whether
or
not
there's
harmony
or
disharmony,
we
just
think
this
is
a
good
policy
and
we're
going
to
adhere
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
outfit
could
certainly
mail
to
the
teachers
who
are
represented
by
your
opposing
labor
group
its
views
at
their
home
address,
couldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
treated
as
junk
mail?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
might
it
be
treated
as
junk
mail?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
is
that
critical
period
of
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
critical?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
kind
of
organize
them
in
a
way?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
win
or
lose
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
raise
the
lack
of
discovery
as
an
issue
on
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
pass
on
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
really
couldn't
urge
that
as
an
alternative
ground
for
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
suppose,
because
if
it
were
found
that
the
discovery
were
inadequate,
it
wouldn't
be
an
affirmance,
and
the
judge
would
send
it
back--
