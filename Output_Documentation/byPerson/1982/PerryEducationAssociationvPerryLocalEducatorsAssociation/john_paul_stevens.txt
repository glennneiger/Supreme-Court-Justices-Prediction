justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
give
us
some
examples
of
communications
from
your
client
to
the
teachers
that
would
be
school
business
as
you
describe
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
taking
one
of
your
examples,
describing
the
result
of
a
particular
grievance
between
one
union
member
and
the
school
board,
i
assume,
why
would
that
be
disseminated
to
the
entire
union
membership?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
tell
them
what
a
fine
job
they've
been
doing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
while
you've
been
interrupted
already,
just
to
clarify,
is
the
school
board
a
party
or
was
it
a
party
below?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
school
board
have
any
interest
in
your
prevailing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
interest
of
the
school
board
that's
at
stake?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
provision
in
dispute
was
adopted
by
the
board
at
the
request
of
your
clients,
was
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
there
any
reason
why,
had
the
union
not
been
interested
in
preventing
your
rival
union
from
having
access,
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
school
board
independently
would
have
concluded
that
this
was
a
desirable
provision?
and
if
so,
what
reason
would
motivate
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
your
opponent's
argument?
he
says,
and
i
think
quite
properly,
that
you
changed
your
position
from
that
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals;
that
now
you
seem
to
rest
entirely
on
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
public
forum.
do
you
agree
that
if
it
is
not
a
public
forum
that
you
lose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
you
are
arguing
it's
a
public
forum.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
arguing
separately,
as
i
understood
the
court
of
appeals
to
hold,
which
is
quite
different
from
the
argument,
that
even
if
it's
not
a
public
forum,
you
nevertheless
are
entitled
to
prevail
under
some
neutrality
approach?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
that
position
survives
the
postal
service
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--greenberg,
yes.
