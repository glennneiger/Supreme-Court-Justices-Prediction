mr.
chanin,
what
does
the
record
show
here
was
the
use
by
others
of
the
mail
facilities?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
record
tell
us
any
more
about
the
specific
uses
than
simply
the
identity
of
the
users?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
exclusive
access.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
the
sg
has
filed
something
with
us
indicating
that
your
union
may
have
to
pay
postage,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
this
exclusive
privilege
may
not
be
worth
much
in
the
future?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
zweig,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
though,
you
urge
that
there
was
a
public
forum
created
by
virtue
of
the
action
in
letting
the
y
and
the
boy
scouts
and
so
forth
use
it.
so
your
position
would
be
even
if
the
school
denied
access
to
pea
that
your
organization
would
be
entitled
to
access,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
zweig,
in
the
usps
versus
council
of
greenburgh
case,
the
court
held
that
the
united
states
mail
system
did
not
require
us
to
have
a
compelling
state
interest
test
applied
to
any
restrictions
placed
on
the
use
of
the
u.s.
mails.
why
is
the
mail
service
of
the
school
district
any
different?
