we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
perry
education
association
against
perry
local
association.
mr.
chanin,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
now.
chief
justice

e.
burger
speaking
of
threshold
questions,
counsel,
at
some
point
i
hope
you're
going
to
address
the
jurisdiction
question.
but
you
do
it
in
your
own
time.

mr.

chief

e.

how?
why?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
the
process
any
different
in
the
advance
authorization
than
in
the
subsequent
ratification?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
the
school
board
has
a
little
less
in
the
way
of
options
in
the
second
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or,
having
heard
it,
dismiss
it
as
improvidently
granted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sometimes
schools
allow
political
candidates
to
come
and
make
speeches
in
the
evening
in
many
states.
do
you
think
when
they
do
that
they
must
either
let
all
candidates
come
or
not
permit
any
to
come?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
hard-pressed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00.
just
a
moment,
counsel,
if
you
will.
mr.
chanin
has
waived
his
rebuttal,
unless
the
court
has
any
questions.
if
not,
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chanin.
