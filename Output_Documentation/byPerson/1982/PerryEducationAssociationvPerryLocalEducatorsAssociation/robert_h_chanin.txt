mr.
robert
h.
chanin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
in
a
public
school
district
in
indiana.
indiana
has
enacted
a
statute
governing
the
labor
relations
of
its
public
school
teachers.
like
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
public
sector
labor
relations
statutes
in
other
states,
it
adopts
the
principle
of
exclusive
recognition.
under
that
principle,
the
union
selected
by
the
majority
of
teachers
in
an
appropriate
bargaining
unit
is
authorized
and
indeed
obligated
to
represent
all
teachers
in
that
unit,
whether
they
are
members
of
the
union
or
not,
in
dealing
with
the
school
district.
in
1977
an
election
was
held
in
the
perry
township
school
district
to
select
an
exclusive
representative
for
the
teachers.
the
competing
organizations
in
that
election
were
the
appellant,
pea,
and
the
appellee,
plea.
during
the
election
campaign
itself,
both
organizations
were
treated
equally
and
they
were
accorded
the
same
opportunity
to
sell
their
programs,
their
activities,
and
their
ideas
to
the
voting
teachers.
the
teachers
voted
and
chose
pea
as
the
exclusive
representative.
pea
subsequently
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
school
district.
among
other
things,
the
agreement
gave
pea
access
to
the
individual
teacher
mailboxes,
which
are
name
slots
which
appear
in
each
school
building,
and
to
the
inter-school
mail
system,
which
is
a
courier
service
by
means
of
which
the
district
delivers
material
from
school
building
to
school
building.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
expressly
stated
that
these
rights
are
given
to
pea...
and
this
is
the
quote
from
the
agreement...
"acting
as
the
representative
of
the
teachers.
"
and
that
article
went
on
to
deny
to
other
employee
organizations,
including
plea,
access
to
those
school
mail
facilities.
the
plea
and
two
of
its
members
challenged
this
access
restriction
as
violative
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
defendants,
but
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
is
unconstitutional
for
a
school
district
to
distinguish
between
the
exclusive
collective
bargaining
representative
and
rival
unions
in
granting
access
to
internal
communication
facilities.
this
holding,
which
would
invalidate
the
prevailing
practice
in
public
sector
labor
law
throughout
this
country,
is
inconsistent
in
several
respects,
we
believe,
with
the
principles
announced
by
this
court.
its
overriding
defect,
however,
is
its
failure
to
recognize
the
distinction
that
this
court
has
drawn
between
public
and
non-public
forums
in
determining
the
constitutionality
of
access
restrictions.
it
is
appropriate
to
begin
analysis
by
setting
forth
the
two
standards
that
this
court
has
adopted.
if
the
property
in
question
constitutes
a
public
forum,
the
government's
right
to
restrict
access
is
subject
to
rather
stringent
limitations.
generally
speaking,
it
only
may
impose
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions
which
are
content-neutral
and
narrowly
drawn
to
meet
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
a
different
standard
applies
if
the
property
is
not
a
public
forum.
although
we
are
not
suggesting
in
any
sense
that
government
is
free
to
act
without
restraint,
the
test
is
a
less
stringent
one.
the
access
restriction
is
constitutional
if
it
is
reasonable
on
the
one
hand,
and
is
not
designed
to
prohibit
access
because
the
government
disapproves
of
a
speaker's
view
or
seeks
to
favor
one
point
of
view
over
another.
it
is
within
this
framework
that
we
believe
the
issue
before
the
court
can
be
best
analyzed,
and
we
believe
that
issue
can
be
divided
into
two
subsidiary
questions.
the
first
is,
which
of
the
two
standards
is
appropriately
applied
to
the
school
mail
facilities?
once
that
is
determined,
the
second
question
is
whether
the
challenged
access
policy
meets
the
appropriate
standard.
although
the
court
below
found
that
the
school
mail
facilities
are
a
nonpublic
forum,
it
did
not
judge
the
constitutionality
of
the
access
policy
by
the
standard
that
this
court
has
held
applies
to
such
forums.
it
applied
instead
the
public
forum
standard
and
concluded
that
the
policy
failed
to
pass
constitutional
muster
under
that
standard.
it
is
our
belief
that
the
latter
conclusion
is
wrong
in
its
own
right
and
that
the
access
policy
here
in
question
is
sustainable
even
under
the
more
stringent
standard.
but
there
is
no
occasion
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
the
dispositive
flaw
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
its
failure
to
use
the
proper
standard
to
judge
the
constitutionality
of
this
access
policy
to
this
nonpublic
forum.
the
appellees
appear
to
concede
this.
they
make
no
attempt
to
defend
the
analysis
or
approach
taken
by
the
court
below.
to
the
contrary,
they
acknowledge
the
importance
of
the
distinction
between
the
standards
governing
access
to
public
and
nonpublic
forums,
and
devote
much
of
their
argument
to
an
effort
to
demonstrate
that
the
school
mail
facilities
are
a
public
forum.
we
submit
this
effort
fails.
under
the
relevant
legal
principles
set
forth
by
this
court,
most
recently
last
term
in
united
states
postal
service
v.
council
of
greenburgh
civic
association,
it
is
clear
that
the
school
mail
facilities
involved
in
this
case
are
a
nonpublic
forum.
it
is
well
established
that
certain
government
property
is
by
its
very
nature
a
public
forum:
streets,
parks,
highways,
and
certain
analogous
facilities
which
historically
have
been
used
for
purposes
of
public
assembly
and
debate.
these,
i
think
the
reference
would
be
traditional
public
forums.
although
it
may
sometimes
be
difficult
to
determine
whether
a
particular
facility
is
sufficiently
analogous
to
a
park
or
a
street
to
be
classed
as
a
traditional
public
forum,
again
this
question
is
of
no
concern
here.
no
one
is
suggesting
that
the
school
mail
facilities
are
in
any
sense
like
the
parks,
like
the
streets,
or
like
the
highways.
it
is
conceded
that
they
are
not
a
traditional
public
forum.
but
that
of
course
is
not
the
end
of
the
matter.
government
may
by
its
actions
convert
what
otherwise
would
be
a
non-public
forum
into
a
public
forum,
and
appellees
contend
that
that
is
what
has
happened
here.
it
is
their
position
as
we
understand
it
that
the
school
mail
facilities
have
been
converted
into
a
public
forum
to
which
they
have
a
constitutional
right
of
access,
and
because
of
the
existence
of
that
right
the
access
policy
before
the
court
must
be
judged
by
the
more
stringent
standard
applicable
to
public
forums.
the
test
to
be
used
in
determining
whether
such
a
conversion
has
taken
place
was
also
set
forth
in
the
greenburgh
case.
if
the
facilities
have
been
preserved
for
the
use
to
which
they
are
lawfully
dedicated
or
preserved
for
their
normal
and
intended
function,
the
property
remains
a
nonpublic
forum.
if
on
the
other
hand
the
facilities
have
been
opened
up
for
more
general
use,
they
may
become
a
public
forum
for
certain
groups
or
for
certain
purposes.
to
apply
this
test
here,
the
threshold
question
is
to
identify
the
uses
for
which
the
school
mail
facilities
are
lawfully
dedicated.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
not
my
intention
to
address
it
in
oral
argument.
we
believe
that
the
point
is
clear
and
we
have
addressed
it
rather
completely
in
our
reply
brief,
and
unless
there
are
questions
we're
prepared
to
rely
on
the
reply
brief.
phrased
otherwise,
the
question
we
must
look
at
it,
what
is
the
normal
and
intended
function
of
these
school
mail
facilities.
the
appellees
point
out
that
they
are
basically
a
communication
medium
and
what
they
seek
to
do
is
communicate,
and
therefore
they
are
within
the
normal
and
intended
function.
we
submit
that
is
far
too
broad
a
formulation.
the
function
must
be
more
narrowly
defined
if
it
is
to
have
any
meaning.
the
normal
and
intended
function
of
a
school
mail
facility
is
not
to
carry
information
by
anyone,
about
any
subject.
the
normal
and
intended
function,
as
both
of
the
lower
courts
recognized,
and
indeed
as
appellees
concede
in
their
briefs,
is
to
communicate
to
the
teachers
information
that
involves
school
business.
that
is
the
normal
and
intended
function.
so
we
must
look
in
this
case
as
to
what
does
the
phrase
"school
business"
mean.
and
in
the
context
that
we
have
before
us,
it
derives
meaning
from
two
sources.
the
first
is
the
inherent
function
of
any
school
district
to
educate
children.
this
function
would
embrace
any
communications
that
the
school
district
reasonably
concludes
are
supportive
of
that
mission,
that
are
of
relevance
and
educational
interest
to
the
students.
but
there
is
in
this
case
a
second
source
from
which
the
phrase
"school
business"
derives
meaning,
and
that
is
the
indiana
labor
relations
statute,
more
specifically
the
representational
duty
that
that
statute
imposes
upon
the
union
that
is
designated
as
the
exclusive
representative
and
which
requires
it
to
have
an
effective
method
for
communicating
with
the
members
of
the
bargaining
unit
that
it
is
both
authorized
and
obligated
to
represent.
the
appellees
admit,
as
does
the
court
below,
that
pea
has
legal
obligations
vis
a
vis
the
members
of
the
bargaining
unit
that
it
does
not
have.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
what
the
record
shows,
justice,
is
that
subsequent
to
the
designation
of
pea
as
the
exclusive
representative
in
1977
the
mail
facilities
have
been
used
by
pea
in
its
representational
capacity
and
by
the
ymca,
the
ywca,
the
cub
scouts
and
certain
parochial
schools,
all
organizations
which
we
submit
are
on
their
face
youth-oriented
civil
organizations
which
are
engaged
in
activities
that
would
be
of
interest
and
educational
relevance
to
students.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
no,
the
record
indeed
says
nothing
about
the
specific
uses
by
pea
or
by
any
of
the
other
groups.
it
merely
identifies
those
who
have
had
access,
and
the
only
groups
that
have
had
post-1977
access
are
the
civic
youth
groups
i've
identified.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
it
is
our
rival.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
oh,
no,
we
have
no
trouble
whatsoever
identifying
the
standard.
we
think
the
standard
is
that
the
school
mail
facilities
since
1977
have
been
limited
to
communications
dealing
with
school
business.
and
we
think
that
youth
organizations
that
wish
to
communicate
about
their
youth-oriented
activities
and
programs
is
school
business,
and
we
think
that
an
elected
exclusive
representative
with
statutory
obligations
toward
the
teachers
is
also
school
business.
the
record
indicates
no
other
use
post-1977,
and
we
think
the
standard
is
clear.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
not
from
the
record,
justice
stevens,
but
i
can
tell
you
what
this
union
and
other
unions
typically
include
in
their
communications.
they
send
information
about
the
implementation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
about
the
settlement
and
disposition
of
grievances,
about
working
conditions
that
they
are
dealing
with
the
school
board
about.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
think
that
may
come
in
occasionally.
but
certainly
that
is
not
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
granted
use.
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
granted
use
is
to
perform
their
functions
as
a
representative
of
all
of
the
teachers.
from
this
record
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
they
did
anything
but
that.
the
contract
specifically
limits
their
use
to
that
function.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
rebut
that.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
there
were
evidence
to
suggest--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--because
the
resolution
of
the
grievance--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--the
resolution
of
a
grievance
that
arises
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
does
not
have
one-on-one
impact.
what
it
will
usually
turn
on
is
the
interpretation
of
a
phrase
or
a
provision
in
a
collective
agreement
which
has
widespread
impact
on
the
entire
bargaining
unit.
we
think
this
court
has
recognized
on
numerous
occasions
that
at
the
very
least,
and
we
believe
it's
probably
broader
than
that,
the
legitimate
functions
of
a
representative
organization
are
collective
bargaining,
contract
negotiation,
and
contract
administration.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
think
that
law
would
be
unconstitutional,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
the
nea
does
not
hold
in
that
context
this
special
status
vis
a
vis
the
constituency
to
who
that
franked
mail
would
go.
what
we
have
here
is
a
union,
the
pea,
which
was
not
chosen
for
unreasonable
or
arbitrary
reasons
to
have
this
access
privilege.
it
competed
under
a
state
law,
under
the
principle
of
exclusive
recognition,
and
it
won.
and
the
only
reason
that
it
has
been
given
access
which
has
been
denied
to
other
unions
is
because
it
won.
now,
the
plea
will
have
an
opportunity
at
an
appropriate
time
under
the
indiana
statute
to
challenge
the
pea.
and
if
it
wins
and
becomes
the
exclusive
representative,
it
will
have
those
legal
obligations
and
we
assume
that
it
will
have
the
access
privilege.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
that
is
not
the
fact,
your
honor.
the
indiana
law
makes
it
clear--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--well,
i
would
like
to
just
focus
in
on
the
fight,
sir.
when
that
fight
takes
place...
and
by
"fight"
i
mean
the
representation
election...
then
both
organizations
that
compete
are
guaranteed
equal
access
to
all
communications
facilities.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
they
will
be
during
the
representation
campaign.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
that's
in
the
record.
in
197--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--it
is
in
the
request
for
admissions,
the
responses.
it
is
also
in
the
affidavit
submitted
by
the
school
board,
and
it's
also
a
matter
of
indiana
law
established
in
the
pike
decision,
which
is
attached
in
our
jurisdictional
statement.
the
law
in
indiana
is
that
exclusive
privileges
of
access
are
available
only
during
the
insulation
period.
the
insulation
period
is
after
a
union
has
won
the
election
and
until
it
may
be
challenged
under
state
law.
in
most
cases
that
is
for
two
years.
in
the
election
that
took
place
in
'77
there
was
equal
access,
and
if
there
is
another
election
there
will
be
equal
access
again.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
state
law
requires
equal
access.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
that
is
correct,
it
allows
it
as
a
bargainable
matter.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
can
point
it
point.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
let
me,
if
i
may,
get
back
to
the
point--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--the
school
board
was
a
party
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
it
has
not
joined
in
the
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i'm
sure
it
does.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
we
would
like
to
believe
that
its
interests
are
that
we
prevail,
that
what
we
are
seeking
here
is
to
sustain
a
provision
which
we
believe
and
which
this
court
has
indicated
contributes
to
labor
peace,
to
labor
stability,
and
to
a
more
rational
relationship.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
it
was
adopted
through
collective
bargaining,
in
the
give
and
take
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
think
there
is
reason
to
conclude
that,
although
i
can't
look
into
the
mind
of
this
school
board.
i
might
suggest
that
congress
has
concluded
that
it
is
a
good
thing
to
limit
it
to
the
exclusive
representative
and
has
built
that
into
the
law
governing
labor
relations
of
federal
employees.
the
new
civil
service
reform
act
in
1978,
picking
up
on
justice
rehnquist's
question,
does
not
merely
authorize
preferential
access,
it
mandates
it.
it
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
allow
a
minority
union
to
use
federal
government
facilities
when
there
is
a
recognized
organization.
so
i
think,
at
least
as
a
general
answer,
here
is
a
presumably
objective
body,
the
united
states
congress,
which
concluded
that
that
contributes
to
a
more
stable
system
of
labor
relations.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
expect
that's
true.
we
have
forced
it,
i
think,
in
two
ways:
through
collective
bargaining
and
because
we
presumably
persuaded
it
that
we
have
legal
obligations
which
this
enable
us
to
perform
more
effectively.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
i
only
know,
your
honor,
and
the
record
only
indicates
what
came
out
of
the
bargaining.
what
came
out
of
the
bargaining
was
the
double-sided
limitation.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
the
exclusive
access,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
your
honor,
yes,
they
have,
they
have.
what
they
have
contended
is
that
allowing
one
of
the
two
facilities
here...
we
have
school
mailboxes
and
inter-school
mail
system.
the
postal
service
takes
the
position
that
for
the
school
district
to
cary
union
mail
in
its
inter-school
mail
system
without
postage
is
a
violation
of
the
private
express
statute.
i
just
might
mention--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--well,
i
think
that
is
an
overstatement,
i
would
like
to
believe,
of
what
they
say.
first
of
all,
their
basic--
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
--pardon
me?
mr.
robert
h.
chanin
at
best
it
is
a
footnote.
we
think
they're
wrong,
and
if
they're
right
it
has
no
relevance.
that's
basically
how
we
view
it.
the
appellees
do
not
even
contend
that
by
allowing
pea
to
use
the
school
mail
facilities
to
perform
its
representational
functions
it
has
gone
beyond
school
business,
and
their
case
for
conversion
is
not
based
on
that
use.
their
case
for
conversion
to
a
public
forum
is
based
on
three
other
alleged
uses.
they
contend
first
that
pea
has
unfettered
use,
that
it
has
not
been
limited
to
access
solely
to
perform
its
representational
function.
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
in
the
record
to
sustain
that
assertion.
the
contract
upon
which
the
access
right
is
based
specifically
says
"acting
as
the
representative
of
the
teachers.
"
the
record
is
totally
silent
in
the
face
of
that
statement.
if
there
were
any
evidence
to
indicate
that
pea
was
granted
or
has
used
the
school
mail
facilities
for
any
other
purpose,
it
would
be
appellees'
burden
to
produce
that
evidence,
and
they
have
failed
to
do
so.
the
appellees
next
assert
that
numerous
non-school-connected
organizations
have
been
allowed
to
use
the
school
mail
facilities,
and
their
quote
is,
"for
purposes
wholly
unrelated
to
official
school
or
educational
concerns.
"
that
is
the
ymca's,
the
cub
scouts,
et
cetera,
which
we
have
spoken
to.
let
me,
if
i
may,
just
put
this
in
a
context,
because
much
of
what
has
been
said
takes
it
out
of
the
way
it
must
be
viewed.
it's
important
to
emphasize
what
is
involved
here.
although
this
case
arises
in
an
educational
setting,
it
does
not
involve
academic
freedom,
textbooks,
students'
rights.
it
is
a
labor
relations
case.
the
plaintiffs
are
a
labor
union
and
two
of
its
members,
and
they
seek
to
use
the
school
mail
facilities
to
promote
their
organization
and
to
increase
its
membership.
the
appellees'
papers
are
filled
with
references
to
the
marketplace
of
ideas
and
monopolistic
control
of
access
media.
they
conclude
their
motion
to
dismiss
by
stating
that
if
this
decision,
this
policy,
is
struck
down
pea
will
be
forced
to
compete
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas
solely
on
the
strength
of
their
ideas
and
program.
we
did
compete
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas.
we
competed
during
the
representation
election,
and
with
equal
access
we
sold
our
ideas
and
our
programs.
and
that's
why
we
have
access
and
they
don't.
now,
if
they
want
to
challenge
us
again
we'll
compete
again,
equally
and
without
preference,
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas.
and
if
they
beat
us,
they'll
have
access.
but
to
suggest,
as
they
do,
that
this
competition
must
go
on
continuously,
and
even
more,
that
the
school
board
has
to
make
its
facilities
available
to
force
that
competition,
is
not
only
unreasonable
but
it
is
the
very
antithesis
of
labor
peace
and
stability.
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
remaining
time.
