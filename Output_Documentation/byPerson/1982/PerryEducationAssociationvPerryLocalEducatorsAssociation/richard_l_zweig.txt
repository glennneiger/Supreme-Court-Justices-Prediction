mr.
richard
l.
zweig
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
a
teachers
union
and
a
school
district
which
grants
the
teachers
union
exclusive
access
to
the
school's
internal
mail
system
and
compels
the
school
district
to
deny
that
right
to
another
teacher
organization,
while
at
the
same
time
the
school
district
is
permitted
and
in
fact
does
allow
numerous
other
organizations
and
individuals
to
use
that
system
for
whatever
purpose
they
deem
appropriate.
the
metropolitan
school
district
of
perry
township
consists
of
13
schools,
and
in
each
school
there
is
a
set
of
mailboxes
which
has
a
teacher's
name
written
above
them.
this
internal
mail
system
and
the
mailboxes
which
are
part
of
it
has
been
in
place
for
a
number
of
years,
and
for
a
number
of
years
outside
groups,
individual
teachers,
the
perry
education
association,
and
the
appellee
here,
perry
local
educators'
association
were
granted
simultaneous
and
equal
access
to
those
facilities.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
i
would
be
glad
to
comment
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
the
perry
education
association
has
attempted
to
invoke
this
court's
appellate
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
28
united
states
code
section
1254.
they
state
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
an
indiana
statute
in
essence
to
be
unconstitutional.
in
point
of
fact,
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
a
paragraph
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
school
district
and
perry
education
association
violated
the
perry
local
educators'
association's
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
indiana
law
does
not
treat
that
contract
as
either
an
ordinance
or
a
statute.
rather,
it
treats
it
simply
as
a
contract.
indeed,
indiana
law
limits
those
bodies
which
are
permitted
to
enact
statutes
or
ordinances.
those
limitations
are
placed
by
the
indiana
general
assembly
and
the
indiana
constitution,
and
nowhere
is
a
school
district
given
the
authority
to
adopt
an
ordinance.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
we
would
say
that
is
appealable,
because
that
would
be
a
unilateral
action
by
the
school
district,
as
opposed
to
something
that
was
the
result
of
a
collective
bargaining
process.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
we
would
say
that
that
is
a
different
situation.
the
situation
which
you
posit
we
believe
is
more
synonymous
with
what
happens
in
the
legislative
process
generally,
where
hearings
are
held
on
bills
that
are
presented
both
to
congress
and
to
state
legislatures,
and
ultimately
it's
the
legislature
that
adopts
that
ordinance
unilaterally
or
that
statute
unilaterally.
and
that's
not
the
case
in
this
instance,
where
you
have
one
party
negotiating
with
another
party
and
the
result
of
that
is
a
contract.
and
indeed,
we
think
that
the
case
centrally
relied
upon
by
the
appellants,
the
king
manufacturing
case,
does
make
that
distinction.
that
case
talks
about
what
a
statute
is
and
what
it
declares
is
that
a
statute
is
a
unilateral
enactment
by
the
legislative
body.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
it
was
approved
at
an
open
school
board
meeting.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
in
one
sense
of
the
word
it
was
a
legislative
act.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
except
that
under
indiana
law
that
wouldn't
be
considered
to
be
a
legislative
act.
it
is
the
result
of
a
collective
bargaining
process
which
requires
adoption
by
the
school
board.
to
that
extent
it
would
be
a
legislative
enactment.
but
we
think
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
if
that
went
through
the
appropriate
process
and
so
on
and
that
was
a
regulation
that
was
adopted,
yes--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--that
might
be
a
legislative
enactment.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
we
do
think
it's
different.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
we
think
it's
different
because
it
is
the
culmination
of
a
process
where
two
parties
are
negotiating
over
a
point.
it
is
different
than
a
legislative
enactment
where
there
is
a
lot
of
debate
and
ultimately
it's
only
the
legislators
who
have
the
authority
to
pass
the
statute
or
the
ordinance.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
the
process
is
different
in
the
way
the
system
sets
up
the--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--the
options
i
think
are
much
more
great
in
the
collective
bargaining
process,
probably,
than
in
the
legislative
enactment
process.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
we
would
ask
this
court
to
find
that
there
is
no
probable
jurisdiction
under
that
statute--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--consider
this
case
as
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
decide
whether
or
not
to
take
the
case,
initially
to
assume
jurisdiction
over
it.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
yes,
that's
what
we
are
suggesting.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
yes,
under
either
form.
in
terms
of
the
substantive
issues
presented
by
this
case,
there
are
some
points
about
which
we
do
agree.
the
first
is
that
the
first
amendment
does
apply
to
the
issues
which
are
raised
by
this
appeal.
so
much
has
been
stated
by
this
court
in
tinker
versus
the
des
moines
independent
school
district
and
by
pickering
versus
the
board
of
education.
that
much
we
all
agree.
we
all
agree
also
on
the
act
that
this
exclusive
access
policy
does
limit
our
rights
of
free
speech
and
assembly
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
it
is
fairly
usable
certainly
in
the
military
area--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--usual,
in
the
military
area.
i
do
not
personally
know
if
it's
fairly
usual
within
all
federal
agencies.
that
is
not
disclosed
by
the
record.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
i
have
to
frankly
say
that
i'm
not
personally
familiar
with
that
particular
statute.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
yes.
yes,
sir.
the
basic
point
of
departure
for
the
decision
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
that
internal
mail
system
which
was
established
by
the
perry
township
school
board
is
a
limited
public
forum,
and
this
court
has
set
out
what
the
test
is
for
a
limited
public
forum
or
a
public
forum
generally.
that's
set
out
in
grayned,
where
the
court
said
that
we
must
inquire
as
to
whether
the
manner
of
expression
is
basically
incompatible
with
the
normal
activity
of
a
particular
place
at
a
particular
time.
the
school
board
in
this
case
has
already
determined
that
plea's
use
of
that
system...
pea's
use
of
that
system,
before
1978
in
any
event...
was
compatible
with
the
uses
for
which
that
system
originally
was
developed,
and
that
is
to
facilitate
communication
between
teachers.
furthermore,
this
court
in
tinker
implicitly
acknowledged
a
public
school
is
a
form
of
a
public
forum,
not
in
the
sense
of
the
national
mall,
not
in
the
sense
of
the
streets
and
the
parks,
but
for
certain
purposes
it
is
a
limited
public
forum;
and
that
speech
within
that
forum
can
be
limited
by
the
state
only
insofar
as
it
will
materially
and
substantially
disrupt
the
education
of
students
and
the
system
generally.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
i
think
that
a
school
district
which
allowed,
for
example,
the
democrats
to
come
in
and
speak
to
the
teachers
would
be
hard-pressed
to
deny
any
other
political
group
access
to
those,
to
the
facilities
for
the
purposes
of--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--i
think
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
we
don't
believe
it's
essential
that
the
court
determine
that
it
is
a
limited
public
forum.
as
the
court
in
bellotti
held,
even
where
there
is
not
a
public
forum,
that
unless
there's
a
compelling
state
interest
in
limiting
a
particular
speaker
to
speech,
that
a
state
has
no
business
silencing
a
particular
speaker
on
any
particular
issue.
and
in
this
case
there
are
no
compelling
state
interests
which
have
been
proven
or
even
suggested
by
the
appellant
or
the
school
district.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
they
suggested
that--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--it
certainly
is,
mr.
justice
brennan.
but
they
suggested
that
only
in
the
courts
below.
they
have
not
reasserted
that
here,
and
presumably
the
reason
they
haven't
reasserted
it
here
is
that
at
no
time
from
1973
forward,
when
pea
first
became
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative,
has
there
been
any
incident
of
labor
disharmony
or
strife
between
plea
and
pea.
there's
just
no
evidence
of
that
whatsoever.
the
second--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--i
think
the
school
board
and
the
state...
strike
that.
just
the
state
can
make
the
determination
that
a
two-year
period
where
there
will
not
be
permitted
any
challenge
to
the
exclusive
bargaining
status
of
a
group,
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
and
maybe
compelling.
it
offers
the
opportunity
to
allow
the
majority
union
to
solidify
its
status,
to
get
its
foot
in
the
door,
to
get
itself
planted,
and
to
do
those
things
which
are
important
for
an
exclusive
bargaining
representative
to
do.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
yes,
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
we
think
those
cases
are
simply
wrong.
on
their
facts
they
are
similar
to
this
case.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
we
do
not
cite
those
cases
in
our
brief.
we
acknowledge,
however,
that
there
is
the
split
of
authority
within
the
circuits,
and
we
contend
that
the
decisions
by
the
second
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
are
simply
wrong
because
they
don't
elevate
the
interests
under
the
first
amendment
to
the
point
where
they're
supposed
to
be
as
we
see
it.
in
essence,
those
courts
held
that
the
first
amendment
rights
being
asserted
were
de
minimis.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
that
might
be
one
purpose
for
which
we'd
put
the
system.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
we
might
also
use
the
system
to
communicate
our
ideas
about
issues
that
come
up
in
the
day
to
day
operations
of
the
schools,
whether
it
be
with
respect
to--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--in
part.
but
it
might
also
be
to
influence
the
members
of
the
pea--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--we
don't
believe
that
it
would,
and
we
base
that
upon
the
facts
of
this
case.
prior
to
the
time
that
this
exclusive
access
policy
was
enacted,
both
pea
and
plea
had
access
to
that
system.
and
during
that
time
there
was
no
incident
of
labor
strife.
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
basis
in
the
record
to
project
that
there's
going
to
be
labor
disharmony
or
strife.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
there
was
an
exclusive
representative
during
that
period,
and
that
exclusive
representative
was
pea.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
we
believe--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--yes.
we
believe
that
the
school
district
could
make
the
choice
to
close
the
system
down
to
both
groups,
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
that
is
what
it
does
during
the
campaign.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
contrary
to
what
my
opposing
counsel
has
indicated,
during
the
period
of
the
campaign
both
groups
are
denied
access.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
that's
right.
it's
request
for
admission
31,
i
believe.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
probably
that
the
communications
system
is
a
very
effective
system
of
communicating
ideas
between
rival
unions
and
their
potential
constituents,
and
what
the
ieerb
board,
the
indiana
education
employment
relations
board,
is
trying
to
do
is
equal
the
access
of
the
two
parties
to
the
teachers
within
the
system.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
that
is
true.
to
the
extent
that
the
school
system
opens
up
that
forum
to
anybody,
to
individuals,
individual
teachers,
as
in
this
case,
to
comment
on
matters
which
concern
the
school,
we
think
that
we
should
have
the
same
access
rights
that
they
have,
because
after
all,
as
this
court
has
held
in
abood,
the
issues
which
are
presented
to
the
teachers
and
to
the
school
system
are
largely
political.
indeed,
under
indiana
law...
and
i'd
refer
the
court
to
the
collective
bargaining
statute,
indiana
code
27.514
and
5.
there
are
a
number
of
items
in
there
which
the
majority
union
is
allowed
both
to
bargain
for
and
to
discuss
with
the
school
system,
and
many
of
those
issues,
such
as
budget
appropriations,
such
as
class
size,
such
as
selection,
assignment
and
promotion
of
personnel,
are
largely
political
questions.
and
what
the
school
board
has
done
by
adopting
this
restrictive
access
policy
has
been
to
give
one
side
of
those
debatable
public
questions
a
much
better
position
with
respect
to
advocating
its
point
of
view
than
another
organization.
and
we
contend
that
it
has
done
so
without
any
compelling
reason
whatsoever.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
it
could
do
that,
but
there
are
two
problems
with
that.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
pardon?
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
i
don't
believe
so.
the
two
significant
problems
with
that
are
that
we
don't
get
the
list
of
teachers
and
the
addresses
of
teachers
until
november
of
the
school
year,
so
that
during
the
critical
period
of
time
when
we
need
to
speak
with
teachers,
a
critical
period
of
time--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--early
on
during
the
school
year.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
because
when
new
teachers
come
in
we
would
like
to
have
the
opportunity
to
speak
with
them,
to
talk
about
the
issues
which
are
presented
to
the
school
system.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
in
a
way,
to
at
least
give
a
contrary
point
of
view
to
that
being
expressed
by
the
majority
union.
so
we
can't
use
the
united
states
mail
system
effectively
before
that
list
is
given
to
us,
whereas
pea
can
immediately
begin
to
transmit
its
messages
the
day
that
the
school
doors
open.
secondly,
we
think
that
there
is
a
much
greater
burden
placed
upon
our
exercise
of
free
speech
than
that
being
placed
on
pea
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
we
will
have
to
pay
20
cents
a
letter
and
they
will
have
to
pay
nothing,
and
in
addition
to
that
will
be
able
to
use
school
personnel
to
get
those
messages
to
the
teachers.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
we
think
it's
different
because
the
private
mailboxes
which
each
of
us
has
in
our
home
are
not,
in
terms
of
the
court,
a
public
forum.
and
the
difference
is
that
in
that
instance
nobody
else
is
granted
access
to
those
mailboxes
except
for
the
united
states
postal
service.
in
that
instance
the
postal
service
does
not
allow
the
democrats
to
use
the
system,
the
mailboxes,
or
the
ymca's
or
the
parochial
schools
or
anything
like
that,
as
we
have
here.
and
what
the
court
said
in
that
case
is
that
they
had
no
occasion
to
be
concerned
about
that
because
it
was
an
equal
exclusion
of
all
people
from
the
system,
whereas
in
this
case
it
is
a
very
selective
exclusion
of
people
from
the
system.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
we
think
that
the
school
board
can
deny
both.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
given
the
entrance
of
other
people,
other
outside
organizations
and
individuals
to
the
system,
based
on
that
we
would
say
we
should
have
the
same
access.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
yes.
it's
all
or
none
proposition
from
our
point
of
view.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
yes,
they
are.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
no.
but
we
wouldn't
have
any
opportunity
to
do
that
within
the
mail
system.
but
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
itself
is
silent
on
that
question.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
in
theory
the
contract
doesn't
prohibit
them
from
taking
that
position.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
the
school
board
did
participate
at
the
district
court
level,
and
they
did
participate
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
extent
that
they
essentially
joined
in
the
position
taken
by
pea.
they
have
not
reasserted
those
positions
in
this
point,
and
instead
has
left
it
to
pea
to
articulate
and
promote
the
so-called
compelling
state
interests
which
are
posited
to
justify
this
restrictive
access
policy.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
yes.
we
would
take
the
same
position,
and
the
basis--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--we
believe
that
because
of
the
nature
of
the
communications
within
that
system,
which
are
largely
political,
that...
and
we
base
that
upon
abood
and
the
city
of
madison
cases,
as
well
as
what
is
articulated
under
indiana
law
as
the
subjects
of
bargaining
and
discussion.
we
believe
that
we...
that
it
would
be
wrong
for
the
school
district
to
exclude
one
group
of
teachers
which
is
as
vitally
concerned
with
the
result
of
any
discussion--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--we
do
not
have
any
schoolteachers
other
than
those
who
are
represented
by
the
perry
local
educators'
association.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
again,
we
would
articulate
that
to
the
extent
that
the
system
is
used
for
political
purposes,
we
should
have
the
same
opportunity
to
speak
on
those
political
issues
as
anybody
else.
we
say
that
in
the
facts
of
this
case
the
court
has...
strike
that...
that
the
school
system
has
opened
up
that
system
for
all--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--yes.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
yes.
we
would
also
adopt
that
position
on
the
basis
of--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--yes.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
in
the
postal
service
case...
i
presume
that's
the
greenberg
case--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--the
court
made
a
strong
point
of
the
fact
that
the
mailboxes
there
and
generally
in
the
country
are
not
open
to
selected
groups
to
use;
that
is
to
say,
the
postal
service
doesn't
attempt
to
distinguish
between
individuals
and
organizations
who
may
gain
access
to
their
private
box
and
exclude
some
and
grant
access
to
others.
so
we
don't
believe
that
the
greenberg
decision
is
in
any
way
contrary
to
the
position
that
we're
asserting
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
we
are
claiming
it
is
a
limited
public
forum.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
this
is
not
like
a
street.
it's
not
like
the
parks.
it
is--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--we
think
it's
similar
to
the
widmar
case.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
but
in
this
case
there
is
no
evidence
that
anybody
other
than
plea
has
been
excluded.
that
is
the
only
group
that's
been
excluded.
other
groups
have
been
granted
access,
and
the
school
system
has
adopted
no
rules--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--we
are
not
familiar
with
any
group
which
has
asked
to
gain
entrance--
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
--during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
we
attempted
through
discovery
to
determine
who
had
been
granted
access
and
who
had
been
denied
access
and
a
number
of
other
issues;
but
our
discovery
was
cut
off
on
a
motion
filed
by
the
appellants
in
this
case,
and
so
we
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
develop
that
particular
point.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
we
lost
in
the
district
court.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
yes,
we
did.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
no,
it
did
not.
it
did
not
rule
on
that.
it
determined
that
the
facts
were
sufficient
to
show
a
clear
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
violation.
mr.
richard
l.
zweig
that's
correct.
the
point
is
that
pea
has
complained
that
we
haven't
shown
a
number
of
facts,
but
the
stark
reality
is
that
we
were
prevented
from
showing
those
facts
by
virtue
of
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
because
the
speech
which
is
within
the
school
district
is,
in
our
view,
inherently
political,
we
believe
that
it
is
an
error
as
a
matter
of
law
for
the
school
district
to
exclude
one
side
of
those
political
views
and
allow
another
side
in.
now,
the
appellants
in
this
case
also
have
claimed
that
because
of
the
alternative
channels
of
communication
available
to
us
that
our
first
amendment
right
is
in
essence
de
minimis,
and
in
that
sense
they
followed
memphis,
aft
and
connecticut,
aft
cases,
the
second
and
sixth
circuit
cases.
but
the
only
opportunity
to
get
to
that
issue
is
if
it
is
shown
that
the
restriction
here
is
a
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restriction.
and
it's
our
suggestion
that
the
restriction
here
is
not
that
because
it
is
content
and
viewpoint-based,
and
it
is,
therefore,
under
the
control
and
precedents
of
this
court
per
se,
unreasonable.
additionally,
the
alternative
channels
of
communication
alleged
to
be
available
to
us
are
really
not
very
availing
and
they're
not
equally
effective.
they
suggest
that
we
can
use
the
intercom
system,
but
that
is
available
only
when
school
was
out
and
the
teachers
are
dispersed
to
the
various
activities
or
to
their
home.
they
suggest
that
we
can
use
the
bulletin
boards,
but
in
point
of
fact
the
record
shows
there's
only
one
bulletin
board,
and
that's
at
the
burkhardt
school
in
all
of
the
perry
township
schools.
and
they
suggest
that
we
can
use
the
meeting
rooms.
we
suggest
that
that's
not
a
very
effective
alternative
either,
because
if
we
can't
tell
the
teachers
what
the
meeting
is
about
and
we
can't
indicate
the
time
and
place
of
the
meeting,
that
the
fact
of
the
meeting
rooms
being
available
is
really
not
availing.
thank
you.
