f.
powell,

may
i
ask
whether
the
school
board
members
are
elected
by
the
public?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
anything
in
the
bargaining
agreement
that
would
prevent
the
union
from
taking
a
position
of
favoring
or
disfavoring
a
candidate
for
election
to
the
school
board?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
silent?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
at
least
in
theory
the
union
could
take
a
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
school
board
participate
in
this
case
at
the
district
court
level?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
counsel,
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier
that
you
perceive
this
to
be
a
limited
public
forum.
it's
certainly
not
the
classical
public
forum.
are
you
claiming
it's
a
limited
one
or
an
unlimited
public
forum?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
should
make
that
clear.
this
is
not
like
a
street.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
is
not
even
like
the
university
in
the
widmar
case
we
had
here
last
term,
is
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
there
were
over
a
hundred
organizations
allowed
to
use
the
building
in
that
case.
