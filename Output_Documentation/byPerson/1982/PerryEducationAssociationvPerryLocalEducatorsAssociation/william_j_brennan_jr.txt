justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
leave
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
to
your
brief,
as
your
adversary
has?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wish
you
would.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say,
mr.
zweig,
that
your
case
depends
on
our
agreeing
with
you
that
this
is
a
limited
public
forum?
suppose
we
don't?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
what
they
suggest
was
that
this
is
in
the
interest
of
labor
peace.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
certainly
a
state
interest,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
if
your
union
has
access
to
the
system
it
would
use
it,
in
large
part
at
least,
to
point
out
the
deficiencies
in
the
representation
by
the
pea,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
what
you
want
to
persuade
the
teacher
constituency
is
that
you'd
be
a
better
representative
of
theirs
than
is
pea;
would
you
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
certainly
set
up
a
not
too
pleasant
atmosphere
for
the
school
board,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
no
exclusive
representative
during
that
period?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
you
prevail
here,
the
school
board
would
be
at
liberty
to
deny
both
unions
access
to
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
it
continues
to
permit
the
boy
scouts
and
these
others
that
are
allowed
to
use
it
to
use
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
what
you're
saying
is
if
you
prevail,
if
the
board
is
to
exercise
the
option
of
closing
down
the
system,
it
will
have
to
close
it
to
everybody.
