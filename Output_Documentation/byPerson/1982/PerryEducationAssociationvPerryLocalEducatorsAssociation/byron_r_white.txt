so
it
took
a
legislative
act
to
approve
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
school
board
in
advance
passes
a
resolution
at
one
of
its
meetings
that,
our
negotiators
are
authorized
to
agree
to
an
exclusive
use
provision
in
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
we
know,
is
that
they
adopted
it
and
authorized
it.
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
legislative
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
it's
different,
do
you
think
it's
different
if
after
the
fact
the
school
board
approves
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
you're
right?
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
decide
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
then
we
should
dismiss
the
appeal
and
then
deny
cert,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
agree,
don't
you,
that
in
the
federal
context
that
this
exclusive
use
of
the
exclusive
representative
is
fairly
usual?
justice
byron
r.
white
usual,
usual.
justice

do
you
agree
or
not
that
5
u.s.c.

provides
for,
is
a
general
provision
requiring
exclusive
use
by
bargaining
agents--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
if
it
is,
it
certainly
is
a
congressional
declaration.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
else
would
you
use
it
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
the
school
board
denied
use
to
all
organizations
except
pea?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
letting...
if
the
school
board
thinks
it's
got
a
good
reason
to
let
its
collective
bargaining
representative
communicate
with
its
teachers,
so
it
lets
that
organization
and
that
organization
alone
communicate
with
the
teachers.
you
think
that
makes
it
a
public
forum
and
lets
you
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
you
get
any
schoolteachers
to
join
you
in
this
suit?
