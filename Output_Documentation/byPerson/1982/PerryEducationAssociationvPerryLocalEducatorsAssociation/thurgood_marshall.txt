what
a
stinker

justice

what
would
happen
if
congress
passed
a
law
which
said
that
the
nea
shall
have
the
authority
to
send
its
mail
with
a
frank
on
it
and
denied
that
to
all
other
organizations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
difference
is
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it'll
be
a
fair
fight,
won't
it?
one

them
has
free
access
and
the
other
one
doesn't.
justice
thurgood

i'm
not
talking
about
indiana
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall

that
give
them
the
right
to
use
those
boxes?
justice
thurgood

now
where'd
i
get
that
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where?
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
sure
wish
you
could
point
that
out
in
the
record,
or
do
i
have
to
go
look
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
okay,
i'll
find
it,
if
it's
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
one
way
to
stop
it
would
be
not
to
let
either
one
use
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
would
be
legal,
wouldn't
it?

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
have
to
be
careful
with
"excluded".
has
any
other
one
asked
to
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
doesn't
mean
excluded,
does
it?
you
have
to
first
ask
in
order
to
use
the
word
"excluded".
