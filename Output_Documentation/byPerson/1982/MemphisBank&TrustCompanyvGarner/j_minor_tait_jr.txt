mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
mr.
creecy
stated,
we
have
more
or
less
divided
our
arguments,
since
the
court
did
grant
us
permission
to
make
divided
argument.
i'm
primarily
going
to
address
the
question
of
discrimination.
i
think
that
this
case
turns
on
two
simple
points.
number
one,
what
type
of
tax
is
involved;
and
number
two,
is
the
tax
discriminatory.
now,
it's
clear
that
no
state
can
tax
an
obligation
of
the
united
states
unless
congress
has
given
its
permission.
i
don't
think
this
point
is
even
in
issue.
at
the
time
that
we
tried
this
case
at
the
trial
level,
congress
had
given
the
states
permission
to
tax
federal
obligations
in
two
areas.
number
one
was
12-548
which
was
the
right
to
tax
national
banks
and
national
banks'
shares.
31-742
gave
the
states
the
right
to
tax
any
obligation
as
long
as
it
was
a
non-discriminatory
franchise
tax.
now,
at
the
trial
level
we
raised
both
548
and
742,
but
the
tennessee
supreme
court
ruled
that
this
was
a
742
tax,
which
was
a
non-discriminatory
franchise
tax.
so
i
only
briefly
addressed
that
in
my
brief.
now,
to
be
a
franchise
tax,
as
mr.
creecy
has
pointed
out,
it
determines
on
whether
or
not
the
tax
is
on
the
business
of
a
corporation...
and
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
when
you
talk
about
non-discriminatory,
you've
got
to
determine
are
we
talking
about
a
franchise
tax,
are
we
talking
about
a
property
tax,
are
we
talking
about
an
income
tax.
now,
i
submit
that
the
appellants
in
their
brief
have
lumped
together
all
type
of
taxes
that
this
court
has
heretofore
ruled
on.
they
have
lumped
together
property
taxes,
they
have
lumped
together
income
taxes,
they
have
lumped
together
franchise
taxes.
now,
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
is
a
non-discriminatory
franchise
tax,
and
that's
all.
we're
not
talking
about
a
property
tax
or
an
income
tax.
now,
it's
been
held
by
this
court
on
many
occasions
that
a
state
has
wide
discretion
in
enacting
franchise
taxes.
that
if
a
corporation
comes
into
a
state
and
gets
the
privileges
to
operate
as
a
corporation,
they
must
pay
a
tax
to
do
that.
and
it's
our
position
that
a
state
has
much
wider
discretion
and
authority
in
the
area
of
a
franchise
tax
than
it
does
in
the
area
of
property
taxes
or
income
taxes.
now,
when
we
look
at
whether
or
not
this
is
a
discriminatory
act...
and
i'm
not
going
to
address
whether
or
not
it's
a
franchise
tax
or
property
tax
because
mr.
creecy
has
done
that.
but
when
we
look
in
the
area
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
discriminatory
tax,
then
we
have
to
look
to
the
decisions
of
this
honorable
court,
and
we
have
to
look
to
the
intention
of
congress.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
discriminatory
does
not
mean
what
the
appellants
would
have
this
court
believe
it
means.
if
you
adopt
the
appellant's
definition
of
discrimination,
as
i
understand
their
argument
they
are
saying
that
if
a
state
exempts
anything
from
a
tax
base,
then
they
have
to
exempt
federal
obligations
or
else
it's
discriminatory.
now,
i
take
that
to
mean
that
if
a
state
exempted
charities
or
hospitals
or
religious
institutions,
then
by
the
same
token,
they
would
have
to
exempt
government
securities
or
government
obligations.
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
that
was
what
he
was
arguing
to
the
court,
but
it's
our
position
that
these
cases
do
not
hold
that;
that
there's
a
common
thread
throughout
the
holdings
of
this
court
that
when
you
talk
about
discrimination
in
the
context
of
a
franchise
tax,
what
you're
talking
about
is
a
direct
effort
by
the
state
to
single
out
the
federal
obligations
for
taxation.
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
well,
the
main
reason,
justice
rehnquist,
is
because
that
is
what
the
decisions,
in
my
judgment,
of
this
court
have
held
for
over
100
years.
now,
that
is
the
definition
that
the
appellants
are
urging
on
the
court;
that
a
tax
is
discriminatory
if
the
taxpayer
has
to
pay
a
higher
tax
because
of
the
fact
that
he
owns
federal
obligations
than
if
he
did
not
own
federal
obligations.
that's
the
entire
thrust
of
their
argument.
they're
saying
that
that's
the
test
that
you
look
at.
that
if
he
has
to
pay
a
higher
tax
because
of
federal
obligations,
then
that's
a
discriminatory
tax.
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
justice
white,
we
say
that
it
is
not.
we
say
that
based
upon
the
prior
holdings
of
this
court,--
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
--the
bank
tax
simply
uses
taxable
federal
income
as
the
base
for
the
tax.
and
the
bank
tax
of
tennessee
does
not
define
or
allow
any
adjustments;
it
simply
says
you
must
go
to
the
excise
tax
of
tennessee
and
use
that
formula
to
determine
the
final
basis
of
the
federal
taxable
income
and
the
tax
base;
that
when
you
go
to
the
excise
statute
of
tennessee,
the
excise
statute
says
you
take
the
federal
base
of
taxable
income
and
you
make
certain
adjustments
and
deductions.
now,
the
problem
is
that
the
federal
government
allows
taxation
on
federal
obligations,
the
income
from
federal
obligations,
so
when
you
get
the
federal
taxable
income
base,
you've
already
got
built
into
that
all
federal
obligations.
now,
it
does
not
allow
the
taxation
of
tennessee
obligations.
so
here
again,
when
you--
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
--well,
that's
not
done
by
the
state
of
tennessee,
though,
it's
done
by
the
federal
government
in
their
federal
tax
structure.
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
they
do.
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
the
state
bonds
are
excluded
under
the
federal
taxable
income.
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
it's
not
done
by
the
state
of
tennessee
legislature.
we're
simply
adopting
what
the
federal
government
uses
on
its
taxable
income
basis.
but
it's
my
point--
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
--i
think
it's
clear
from
this
record
that
the
tennessee
legislature
itself
did
nothing
to
tax
federal
obligations.
and
i
think
that's
a
key
and
important
point
because
throughout
the
cases
on
this
subject
there's
a
thread
that
says
that
it
has
to
be
a
direct
intentional
act
to
single
out
the
federal
obligations
for
taxation.
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
on
the
basis
from
federal
taxable
income,
the
state
act
adds
in
the
obligations
from
other
states.
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
except
tennessee.
and
under
tennessee
law,
tennessee
obligations
are
excluded.
so
tennessee
could
not
add
in
tennessee
obligations.
an
interesting
comment
of
this
court
was
in
miller
versus
milwaukee...
and
this
is
a
case,
or
one
of
the
cases
that
we're
relying
upon
on
our
position
that
it
has
to
be
more
than
just
a
discrimination
or
a
difference
in
the
tax
base.
and
i
quote
from
miller,
"a
tax
may
very
well
be
upheld
as
against
any
casual
effect
it
may
have
upon
the
bonds
of
the
united
states
when
passed
with
a
different
intent
and
not
aimed
at
them.
"
"but
it
becomes
a
more
serious
attack
on
their
immunity
when
they
are
its
obvious
aim.
"
now,
it's
our
position
that
that
shows
that
what
they're
talking
about
in
the
context
of
a
franchise
tax...
and
i
keep
coming
back
to
that
because
the
appellants
are
lumping
in
all
type
of
taxes.
they're
even
talking
about...
and
mr.
worthy
mentioned...
cases
involved
doing
business
with
the
united
states
government,
and
they've
cited
in
their
brief
property
taxes
and
income
taxes.
but
a
franchise
tax,
based
upon
prior
holdings
of
this
court,
is
a
peculiar
tax.
and
this
court
has
ruled
time
and
time
again
that
the
states
have
a
wide
discretion
in
assessing
a
franchise
tax.
they
can
include
some
property,
exclude
other
property.
they
can
set
one
basis
for
one
property,
or
set
a
different
basis
for
another
property.
now,
this
same
theme--
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
--i
think
if
it's
not
a
742
non-discriminatory
franchise
tax,
or
it's
not
a
548
tax
under
the
national
bank
shares,
then
the
state
of
tennessee
could
not
tax
federal
obligations.
and
i
still--
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
--not...
well,
it
depends
on
what
you're
saying--
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
--there's
a
difference
in
taxing
the
property
itself,
and
there's
a
difference
in
using
the
property
as
the
measure
of
the
tax.
now,
if
they're
only
using
the
income
as
the
measure
of
the
tax,
then
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
that.
but
the
cases
make
a
distinction
in
that
regard.
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
it's
what
they
called
it.
i
think
that
the
act
speaks
for
itself.
and
if
you
are
taxing
property
as
compared
to
the
privilege
or
the
franchise
to
do
business,
then
it's
not
a
franchise
tax,
it's
a
property
tax.
and
i
don't
think
they
can
do
that
in
the
context
of
a
property
tax.
but
where
you
are
taxing
the
right
of
a
corporation
to
do
business...
and
that's
all
the
bank
tax
is.
in
tennessee,
banks
enjoy
special
privileges
and
rights
and
immunities.
now,
as
a
consideration
of
that
right
to
do
business,
then
they
pay
a
franchise
tax.
and
that's
all
that
tennessee
is
doing
in
this
case.
if
they
didn't
operate
as
a
bank,
then
they
would
not--
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
--as
i
understand
the--
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
--i
don't
think
there's
any
limit
to
the
amount
of
franchise
or
privilege
taxes
the
state
can
assess
as
long
as
they're
not
arbitrary
and
unreasonable.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
banks
do
pay
the
same
excise
franchise
tax
as
other
corporations.
now,
they
are
excluded
from
a
business
tax
in
tennessee,
which
is
another
privilege
tax
that
banks
do
not
pay.
but
this
bank
tax
only
applies
to
banks,
to
no
one
else.
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
we
raised
that
in
our
brief,
and
that
is
a
question
of
fact.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
appellants
have
been
taking
that
position
throughout
this
lengthy
litigation.
they're
saying
that
these
tennessee
bonds
are
in
substantial
competition.
i'd
like
to
point
out...
you
asked
a
question
of
mr.
worthy
a
moment
ago,
if
548
had
any
application.
if
you
will
look
at
548,
one
of
the
definitions
of
congress
is
that
the
money
capital
has
to
be
in
substantial
competition
with
the
federal
obligation.
and
that
is
specifically
set
out
in
548,
which
shows
to
me
that
the
intent
of
congress
is
that
these
other
obligations
have
to
be
in
substantial
competition.
there's
no
proof
in
this
record;
it's
just
silent
as
a
tomb,
as
they
say,
about
whether
or
not
there's
any
direct
competition.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
important
point
and
we
raised
that
in
our
brief,
that
that
was
incumbent
upon
the
appellants
to
prove
that,
if
that
is
their
position.
now,
if
they
cite
out...
and
they
take
great
joy
in
citing
the
amicus
brief
of
the
attorney
general
that
some
$250
million
in
obligations
are
involved.
that's
assuming
that
all
of
these
banks
would
abandon
u.s.
obligations
and
buy
tennessee
obligations,
of
which
there's
no
proof
at
all
in
this
record.
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
the
positions
are
identical.
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
well,
the
money
goes
to
the
county
and
city;
it
does
not
go
to
the
state...
the
state
has
an
interest
in
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
in
question,
and
i
might
point
out
that
this
is
of
utmost
concern
to
the
state
of
tennessee
because
the
formula
that
we
use
in
the
bank
tax
is
the
same
formula
that
we
use
in
our
excise
tax.
mr.
j.
minor
tait,
jr.
well,
i
was
going
to
argue
and
the
state
wanted
to
be
heard
because
of
the
constitutionality,
and
that's
basically
what
happened.
i
felt
like
that
we
should
split
it
because
there's
more
involved
than
just
the
interest
of
memphis
and
shelby
county,
tennessee
in
this
lawsuit;
it
has
statewide
application,
and
i
just
felt
like
it
should
be
split
and
agreed
to.
i
thank
you.
