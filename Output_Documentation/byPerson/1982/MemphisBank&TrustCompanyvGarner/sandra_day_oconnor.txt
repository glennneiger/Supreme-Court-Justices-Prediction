mr.
worthy,
is
that
question
to
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
do
you
think,
whether
it's
a
franchise
tax
within
the
meaning
of
section
742?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
worthy,
do
you
think
that
section
548
of
title
12
u.s.
code
has
any
impact
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
any
effect
here
on
the
result
of
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
a
minor
point,
if
i
may,
while
you're
interrupted.
the
parties
stipulated
that
no
tax
is
due
if
the
federal
obligations
can't
be
included
in
net
earnings.
now,
does
that
stipulation
mean
that
no
minimum
tax
would
be
owing,
regardless
of
what
we
held
under
the
tennessee
tax
provisions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
effect,
you've
stipulated
that
there
would
be
none
owing
on
the
minimum
tax.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
tait,
would
you
agree
that
the
tennessee
bonds
and
securities
are
in
substantial
competition
with
the
federal
securities
here?
