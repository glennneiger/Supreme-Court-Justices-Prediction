mr.
k.
martin
worthy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
tennessee
bank
tax
violates
federal
law
to
the
extent
that
it
includes
interest
on
the
obligations
of
the
federal
government
and
its
instrumentalities
in
the
tax
base,
while
excluding
interest
from
similar
obligations
issued
by
the
state
of
tennessee
itself.
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
reversing
the
chancery
court,
said
no.
we
think
the
answer
is
clearly
yes.
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
essential
facts.
in
1977,
the
tennesse
legislature
made
inapplicable
to
banks
the
existing
intangible
personal
property
tax
on
financial
institutions
which
made
no
distinction
between
state
and
federal
obligations.
and
it
created
instead,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
a
subclassification
of
intangible
personal
property
designated
as
shares
of
banks
and
banking
institutions
to
be
taxed
at
3
percent
on
net
income
of
the
previous
year.
earnings
are
required
for
this
purpose
to
be
computed
by
including
interest
on
obligations
of
the
federal
government
and
its
instrumentalities,
and
also
including
interest
on
obligations
of
other
states,
but
by
excluding
interest
on
obligations
of
the
state
of
tennessee
itself.
the
tax
in
no
event
is
to
be
less
than
an
ad
valorem
tax
of
60
percent
on
the
value
of
the
property
of
the
bank.
the
tax
is
an
obligation
of
the
bank
itself,
and
is
not
collectible
by
either
the
state
or
the
bank
itself
from
its
stockholders.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
yes,
sir.
there
is
a...
all
banks
and
all
other
corporations
are
subject
specifically
to
a
tennessee
franchise
tax
which
is
imposed
specifically
on
the...
to
quote
from
that
statute...
on
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
business
in
corporate
form
in
the
state.
and
every
corporation
is
also
required
to
pay
an
excise
tax
which
is
imposed
specifically,
to
quote
that
statute,
as
compensation
for
the
benefits
it
receives
from
doing
business
in
tennessee.
there
is
no
such
language
in
the
statute
imposing
the
bank
tax.
appellant,
the
memphis
bank
&
trust
company,
a
state
bank,
paid
the
tax
as
so
imposed
under
protest
for
1977
and
'78,
and
brought
suit
in
the
chancery
court
for
refund
of
the
tax,
contending
that
collection
of
the
tax
violated
federal
law
to
the
extent
that
the
tax
applied
to
interest
earned
on
obligations
of
the
federal
government
and
federal
farm
credit
agencies,
and
thereby
violated
the
prohibitions
of
state
taxation
contained
in
section
742
of
title
31
of
the
united
states
code,
and
sections
2055,
2079
and
2134
of
title
xii
of
the
code,
relating
to
farm
credit
agencies.
it
was
thereafter
stipulated
that
if
such
interests
were
excluded,
appellant
would
have
no
liability
for
tax
for
the
years
in
issue.
codifying
a
long
line
of
decisions
of
this
court,
going
back
to
m'culloch
versus
maryland,
more
than
160
years
ago,
section
742
of
title
31
of
the
code
specifically
prohibits
every
form
of
state
taxation
directly
or
indirectly
on
interest
from
federal
obligations,
except
non-discriminatory
franchise
or
other
non-property
taxes
in
lieu
thereof.
the
tennessee
tax
clearly
violates
the
general
prohibition
of
the
statute.
the
state
claims,
however,
that
the
tax
fits
within
the
exception
for
non-discriminatory
franchise
or
other
non-property
taxes
imposed
in
lieu
thereof.
appellant
submits
that
it
does
not.
first
of
all,
it's
not
a
franchise
tax
or
other
non-property
tax
imposed
in
lieu
thereof.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
yes,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
it
is
to
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
i
have,
obviously,...
i
think
this
court
has
held
that
it
should
look
at
the
effect
of
the
law
to
determine
whether
it's
a
franchise
or
a
property
tax.
obviously,
the
intent
of
the
legislature
and
the
authority
under
which
the
legislature
acted
are
prime
considerations
in
determining
the
nature
of
the
tax.
but
it
is
a
question
to
be
resolved
by
this
court.
even
if
the
tax
is
a
franchise
tax,
we
believe
that
it's
clearly
discriminatory.
it
is
quite
clear
that
in
enacting
the
bank
tax,
the
tennessee
legislature
intended
to
impose
a
property
tax
and
not
a
franchise
or
similar
non-property
tax.
the
preamble
to
the
act
imposing
the
tax
states
specifically
that
the
legislature
is
acting
under
authority
to
tax
intangible
personal
property
of
banks,
and
to
divide
intangible
personal
property
into
subclassifications.
there
is
no
mention
of
any
authority
or
any
statement
of
intent
to
impose
a
franchise
or
privilege
tax.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
that's
correct,
justice
white.
as
i've
indicated,
the
act
creates
a
subclassification
of
intangible
personal
property
designated
as
shares
of
banks
to
be
taxed
on
the
basis
of
3
percent
of
net
earnings,
with
the
net
tax
in
no
event
to
be
less
than
an
ad
valorem
tax
of
60
percent
of
the
value
of
the
property
of
the
bank,
with
a
credit
for
tax
paid
on
its
real
and
personal
property.
the
tax
is
codified
in
the
same
chapter
of
the
tennessee
code
as
other
property
taxes,
unlike
those
on
franchises
and
excises.
payment
and
collection
are
at
the
local
level,
in
contrast
with
the
provisions
for
payment
and
collection
at
the
state
level
of
tennessee
franchise
and
privilege
taxes.
futhermore,
the
tax
is
allocated
to
the
municipalities
and
counties
on
the
basis
of
their
respective
property
tax
rates.
as
i
previously
indicated,
the
bank
is
subject
to
both
the
regular
general
tennessee
franchise
tax
imposed
by
a
different
chapter
of
the
code
and
to
the
tennessee
excise
tax
imposed
by
a
different
chapter
of
the
code.
the
state
nevertheless
says
that
because
the
bank
tax
is
measured
by
income,
it
should
be
treated
as
a
franchise
tax.
this
certainly
does
not
follow.
the
nature
of
a
tax
is
not
determined
by
its
method
of
calculation.
this
court
has
many
times
held
that
a
tax
imposed
as
a
franchise
tax
will
be
treated
as
a
franchise
tax
even
though
it
is
measured
by
the
value
of
the
property.
by
the
same
token,
a
tax
imposed
as
a
property
tax
should
be
treated
as
a
property
tax
even
though
the
measure
of
the
value
of
the
property
is
income.
it's
long
been
settled
in
cases
going
back
to
1829
by
this
court
that
federal
obligations
may
not
be
included
in
the
measure
of
a
state
property
tax,
and
this
principle
is
now
codified
in
section
742
in
prohibiting
a
state
property
tax
in
any
form
which
directly
or
indirectly
taxes
federal
obligations
or
the
interest
thereon.
for
this
reason
alone,
the
tennessee
statute
should
be
declared
invalid
insofar
as
it
requires
interest
from
federal
obligations
to
be
included
in
the
tax
base.
but
even
if
the
tennessee
tax
were
regarded
as
a
franchise
tax,
it
clearly
violates
federal
law
because
it
discriminates
against
federal
obligations
by
requiring
that
interest
therefrom
be
taxed
while
specifically
exempting
in
interest
from
obligations
of
the
state
of
tennessee
itself.
there
have
been
numerous
cases
in
which
this
court
has
stated
that
the
proper
test
of
whether
there
is
discrimination
is
simply
whether
the
tax
is
higher
as
a
result
of
an
investment
being
made
in
federal
obligations
than
it
would
be
if
a
similar
investment
were
made
in
some
other
assets.
this
principle
is
specifically
demonstrated
in
the
schuylkill
case,
the
first
schuylkill
case
in
1935,
in
which
pennsylvania
imposed
a
tax
on
trust
companies
on
the
value
of
shares
represented
by
investments
in
government
obligations,
but
exempted
from
tax
such
value
represented
by
investments
in
tennessee...
excuse
me,
in
pennsylvania
corporations
and
such
other
assets
as
pennsylvania
chose
to
exempt.
this
court
said
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
the
conclusion
that
the
law
discriminates
in
favor
of
companies
owning
stocks
already
taxed
or
relieved
from
taxation
by
the
state,
and
against
those
companies
amongst
whose
assets
there
are
united
states
bonds
taxed
by
reason
of
ownership
of
such
federal
securities.
now,
appellees
in
their
brief
vigorously
criticize
schuylkill
contending
that
it
stands
alone
as
authority
in
support
of
the
bank's
position
in
this
case.
not
so.
the
principle
is
well
established
in
other
cases.
in
national
life
versus
united
states
in
1928,
this
court
applied
precisely
the
same
principle
to
a
federal
attempt
to
impose
a
tax
on
state
obligations,
invalidating
the
tax,
because
it
required
petitioner
to
pay
more
upon
its
taxable
income
than
could
have
been
imposed
had
its
income
from
state
obligations
been
derived
instead
from
other
securities.
and
the
test
has
been
restated
many
times
by
the
court
as
a
basis
for
finding
lack
of
discrimination.
for
example,
in
the
home
insurance
case
in
1890
in
upholding
a
new
york
tax,
this
court
emphasized
that
the
tax
sustained,
and
i
quote,
"would
not
be
affected
if
the
nature
of
the
property
in
which
the
whole
capital
stock
is
invested
were
changed
and
put
into
real
property
or
bonds
of
new
york
or
of
other
states.
"
that
is,
of
course,
the
reverse
of
the
situation
here
in
that
the
tax
here
would
be
reduced
if
the
investment
were
shifted
from
federal
to
state
bonds.
and
although
dicta,
the
court
in
the
bank
of
commerce
case
cited
the
statute
in
weston
versus
city
of
charleston
in
which
federal
obligations
and
most
other
personal
assets,
but
not
state
obligations,
were
taxed
as
a
prime
example
of
discrimination.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
more
recently,
in
the
curtis
publishing
case
in
1949
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari,
invalidated
a
tax
strikingly
similar
to
that
of
the
tennessee
tax
involved
here.
pennsylvania,
like
tennessee,
had
adopted
the
federal
test
of
net
income
including
interest
on
federal
obligations
but
excluding
interest
on
pennsylvania
obligations.
it
was
held
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
that
the
inclusion
of
federal
interest
while
excluding
state
interest
constituted
unlawful
discrimination
against
federal
obligations,
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
and
just
a
few
months
ago,
the
supreme
court
of
alaska,
in
the
national
bank
of
alaska
case,
held
that
it
would
be
an
unlawful
discrimination
for
state
privilege
tax
to
include
in
its
measure
income
from
federal
obligations
while
excluding
income
from
alaska
state
obligations.
in
a
slightly
different
context
but
involving
the
same
principle
this
court,
in
fact,
in
1960
in
the
phillips
chemical
case,
invalidated
a
state
tax
imposed
on
a
lessee
of
federal
lands
where
an
equivalent
tax
burden
was
applied
to
lessees
of
all
lands
in
the
state
except
state
lands.
the
court
said,
the
state
and
the
school
district
concede
that
phillips
would
not
be
taxed
at
all
if
its
lessor
were
the
state
or
one
of
its
political
subdivisions
instead
of
the
federal
government.
it
does
not
seem
too
much
to
require
that
the
state
treat
those
who
deal
with
the
government
as
well
as
it
treats
those
with
whom
it
deals
itself.
this
language
was
repeated
by
the
court
in
invalidating
a
washington
state
tax
in
the
moses
lake
homes
case
in
1961,
and
certainly
applies
here.
as
very
simply
put
in
curtis,
the
state
has
no
right
to
tax
federal
securities
while
leaving
its
own
untaxed.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
does
it
have
any...
i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor?
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
section
548
as
now
in
effect
and
has
been
for
several
years
and
as
in
effect
during
the
years
in
issue
here,
simply
provides
that
the
states
may
tax
national
banks
to
the
same
extent
as
they
tax
state
banks,
and
that
section
obviously
does
not
give
the
states
any
right
to
tax
either
state
or
national
banks
to
any
greater
extent
than
they
can
tax
any
other
corporation.
section
548
as
it
existed
prior
to
its
amendment
provided,
among
other
things,
that
a
state
could
not
impose
a
tax
on
a
national
bank
measured
by
income
to
any
greater
extent
than
it
imposed
on
manufacturing
and
mercantile
corporations.
obviously,
under
the
long
line
of
cases
of
this
court
and
as
codified
now
in
section
742
of
title
31,
states
cannot
impose
a
tax
on
mercantile
or
manufacturing
corporations
which
discriminate
against
federal
obligations
or
the
interest
thereon.
i
don't
think
section
548
really
has
any
relevance
whatever
to
the
issue
before
the
court
today.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
yes,
sir,
i
did.
it's
reported--
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
--yes,
sir.
it's
69
atlantic
2d
410,
and
i
believe
it
is
referred
to...
it's
the
curtis
publishing
case,
and
it
is--
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
--yes,
sir.
i
probably
didn't
refer
to
the
plaintiff
but
to
the
defendant.
now,
the
state
suggests
in
its
brief
that
there's
no
discrimination
if
inclusion
of
interest
on
federal
obligations
is
casual
or
incidental,
and
that
the
federal
obligations
must
be
singled
out
for
tax
for
the
rule
of
discrimination
to
apply.
but
i
call
to
your
attention
that
that
was
not
the
case
in
the
phillips,
just
cited,
where
this
court
was
careful
to
point
out
that
the
tax
burden
on
private
lands
was
exactly
the
same
as
on
federal
lands.
yet,
exemption
of
state
lands
was
sufficient
for
the
matter
to
be
treated
as
one
of
discrimination,
invalidating
the
state
tax.
and
in
miller
versus
milwaukee,
a
case
relied
on
very
heavily
by
the
state
of
tennessee
in
its
briefs,
the
record
discloses
that
the
tax
there
involved
did
not
apply
solely
to
income
derived
from
federal
obligations,
but
also
applied
to
income
from
a
variety
of
other
sources
such
as
wages,
salaries,
business
profits,
dividends
from
activities
carried
on
in
other
states.
and
this
court
held
that
the
tax
was
invalid
because
of
its
discrimination
in
exempting
income
from
other
investments
while
including
the
income
from
federal
obligations.
the
suggestion
of
appellees
that
the
appellant
has
the
burden
of
establishing
that
state
obligations
are
in
direct
competition
with
the
federal
bonds,
or
the
burden
of
establishing
that
the
tennessee
tax
inhibits
the
purchase
of
federal
bonds
simply
has
no
support
whatever.
in
valuing
a
debt
obligation,
a
free
market
takes
into
account
a
great
many
factors.
the
risk,
the
term,
the
interest
rate,
the
rate
of
return
after
all
taxes,
and
obviously,
after
everything
has
been
taken
into
account,
the
burden
of
the
bank
tax
reduces
the
value
of
federal
obligations
below
what
they
would
be
if
no
such
tax
was
imposed.
and
the
absence
of
such
a
tax
on
tennessee
obligations
increases
the
value
of
those
obligations
above
what
they
would
be
if
such
a
tax
was
imposed.
as
the
curtis
case
said,
when
pennsylvania
exempts
from
taxation
its
own
securities
but
taxes
directly
or
indirectly
the
securities
of
the
united
states,
the
latter
securities
are
handicapped
in
their
competition
with
the
securities
of
pennsylvania
among
buyers
in
the
marketplace.
as
far
back
as
m'culloch
versus
maryland
and
weston
versus
city
of
charleston
in
the
1800s,
this
court
said
that
it
would
invalidate
a
discriminatory
tax
however
inconsiderable
the
burden
on
the
government.
and
in
both
smith
versus
davis
in
1944
and
the
new
jersey
realty
title
insurance
company
case
in
1946,
this
court
reiterated
the
principle
by
ruling
that
the
exemption
statute
is
intended,
and
i
quote,
"to
prevent
taxes
which
diminish
in
the
slightest
degree
the
market
value
or
investment
attractiveness
of
obligations
issued
by
the
united
states.
"
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
the
burden
here
is
even
slight
or
inconsiderable,
in
light
of
the
solicitor
general's
calculation
in
the
amicus
brief,
which
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
in
behalf
of
the
federal
government
in
this
case,
that
imposition
of
a
tax
by
every
state
similar
to
that
of
the
bank
tax
imposed
by
tennessee
would
impose
an
additional
burden
on
the
borrowing
power
of
the
united
states
of
over
a
quarter
of
a
billion
dollars
a
year.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
court
should
reverse
the
tennessee
supreme
court
and
hold
that
the
tennessee
bank
tax
violates
federal
law
to
the
extent
that
it
requires
that
there
be
included
in
the
tax
base
obligations
of
the
federal
government
and
its
instrumentalities
and
all
the
interest
thereon,
while
excluding
the
interest
from
that
of
the
state
of
tennessee
itself.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
creecy
cited
a
number
of
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
a
franchise
tax
may
properly
be
imposed
on
the
interest
on
federal
obligations
or
on
federal
obligations
themselves.
he
failed
to
note,
however,
that
several
of
those
cases,
the
educational
foundation
case,
the
werner
machine
case,
the
tradesman's
bank
case
and
many
others,
all
note
that
the
states
can
impose
such
a
tax,
provided
it
is
not
discriminatory.
for
example,
in
the
werner
machine
company
case,
it
validated
the
tax,
held
it
was
lawful,
since
the
tax
measures...
since
the
tax
is
the
same
whatever
the
character
of
the
assets
may
be.
now,
interestingly
enough,
when
mr.
tait
talks
about
discrimination,
he
hasn't
really
told
us
what
discrimination
is
except
to
say
that
all
of
the
theories
of
discrimination
which
this
court
has
announced
in
numerous
cases,
are
inapplicable.
all
he
says
is
that
there
is
no
discrimination
if
federal
obligations
are
not
singled
out.
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
original
argument,
in
both
the
phillips
chemical
case
and
the
miller
versus
milwaukee
case,
there
was
no
singling
out
of
federal
obligations,
yet
the
tax
was
found
to
be
invalid.
and
insofar
as
the
intent
of
the
legislature
in
imposing
the
tax
is
concerned,
i
do
call
to
your
attention
that
the
tennessee
legislature
was
specifically
aware,
when
it
adopted
the
formula
for
the
measurement
of
income,
as
shown
by
the
report
of
the
legislative
committee
which
is
referred
to
on
page
10
of
our
reply
brief,
that
it
knew
that
it
was
taxing
interest
on
federal
obligations,
knew
that
it
was
not
taxing
interest
on
obligations
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
knew
that
it
was
taxing
interest
on
obligations
of
other
states.
so
it
deliberately
chose
the
course
which
it
followed.
thank
you.
