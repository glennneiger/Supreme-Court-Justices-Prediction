mr.
tait,
am
i
mistaken
or
do
i
recall
correctly
that
your
tax
law
does
impose
a
tax
on
the
income
from
other
state
bonds;
not
tennessee
but,
say,
west
virginia?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
that's
not
in
the...
even
though
the
federal
government
doesn't
tax
those.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
they
did,
in
effect,
is
they
added
into
the
federal
base
all
state
income
except
from
tennessee
bonds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
supposing
it
were
not
a
franchise
tax,
for
a
moment,
but
were
an
income
tax,
at
say
a
10
percent
rate.
so
it
would
be
another
non-property
tax.
would
you
agree
it
would
be
discriminatory
for
that
kind
of
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
could
they
include
it
in
the...
oh,
all
right.
but
you
would
agree
that
would
be
discriminatory
in
that
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
saying
you
really
don't
reach
the
discriminatory
issue
in
that
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
you
say
they
could
even
go
up...
increase
the
rate
to
10
or
15
percent
and
base
it
on
income
and
say
we'll
call
this
thing
a
franchise
tax,
and
it
would
be
all
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down.
as
i
correct
in
assuming
there
really
is
no
difference
in
the
legal
position
of
your
client
and
of
the
state's
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
why
you
filed
separate
briefs
and
had
separate
arguments?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
questioning
your
right,
either
of
you.
i'm
just
curious
to
know
as
a
matter...
because
it's
sometimes
a
less
effective
method
of
presentation
to
divide
arguments.
