is
there
any
way
for
us
to
rule
with
you
without
declaring
that
this
is
a
"franchise"
tax?
is
there
any
other
way
we
can
rule
with
you?
justice
thurgood

how
many
franchise
taxes
could
you
put
on
a
bank?
justice

it's
unlimited,
isn't
it?
in

theory.
justice

in
the
other
case,
memphis
bank
&
trust
company
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee.
the
state
of
tennessee
imposed
a
tax
on
the
net
earnings
of
banks
doing
business
within
the
state.
the
bank
tax
defines
net
earnings
to
include
income
from
obligations
of
the
united
states
and
its
agencies
but
to
exclude
interest
earned
on
the
obligations
of
tennessee
and
its
political
subdivisions.
the
appellant,
memphis
bank
&
trust
company
brought
a
challenge
in
this
tennessee
bank
tax
under
31
u.s.c.
section
742
and
the
supremacy
clause.
742
makes
the
obligations
of
the
united
states
immune
from
state
and
local
taxation.
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
held
that
the
bank
tax
does
not
violate
this
provision
because
the
bank
tax
falls
within
the
exception
for
nondiscriminatory
franchise
taxes
set
forth
in
section
742.
we
disagree.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
tennessee
bank
tax
is
"discriminatory"
within
the
meaning
of
742.
a
state
tax
is
discriminatory
if
it
imposes
a
greater
burden
on
holders
of
federal
property
than
on
the
holders
of
similar
state
property.
the
tennessee
bank
tax
discriminates
in
favor
of
securities
issued
by
tennessee
and
against
federal
obligations.
it
does
so
by
including
in
the
tax
base
income
from
federal
obligations
while
excluding
income
from
comparable
state
and
local
obligations.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
