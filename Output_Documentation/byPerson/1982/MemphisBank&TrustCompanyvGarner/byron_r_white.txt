so
what
your
argument
now
is
that
even
if
tennessee
obligations
were
included
in
the
basis
of
the
tax,
the
tax
is
not
one
permitted
by
the
federal
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white

this
explicitly
discriminatory,
though?
it's
an
explicit
discriminatory
classification.
it
says
that
it
includes
income
from
federal
bonds.

or,
it
explicitly
excludes

which
does
it?
does
it
explicitly
exclude
the
income
from
state
bonds?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there

we'll
take
this
base
that

income
from
federal
bonds
but
which
excludes
the
state
bond
income.
