mr.
jimmy
c.
creecy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
justices,
may
it
please
the
court:
because
of
the
impact
of
this
case
upon
state
and
local
government,
a
motion
was
filed
to
divide
the
argument
in
this
case
and
it
was
granted.
in
examining
the
tennessee
bank
tax
statute
here,
section
742
sets
up
two
standards.
one,
the
nature
of
the
tax
imposed;
and
two,
whether
or
not
there
is
discrimination
against
federal
securities
within
the
meaning
of
section
742.
for
the
purposes
of
oral
argument,
i
will
address
the
nature
of
the
tax
involved,
and
mr.
minor
tait,
representing
shelby
county
in
memphis,
tennessee,
will
address
the
discrimination
issue.
section
742
of
title
31
is
a
codification
of
many
opinions
of
this
court
dealing
with
the
parameters
within
which
a
state
may
tax
federal
securities
and
the
interest
thereon,
in
accordance
with
the
supremacy
clause
and
the
borrowing
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
as
early
as
1819
in
the
similar
case
of
m'culloch
v.
maryland
the
principle
was
established
that
the
states
cannot
directly
tax
federal
obligations
or
their
interest.
in
1829,
the
court
further
noted
in
the
case
of
weston
v.
city
council
of
charleston
that
a
direct
tax
on
u.s.
obligations
was
prohibited
and
void.
section
742,
which
originated
and
was
first
codified
in
the
1860s,
sets
forth
this
basic
exemption
that
a
state
cannot
tax
stocks,
bonds,
treasury
notes
or
other
obligations
of
the
united
states
government.
it's
expressly
prohibited
by
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
and
the
borrowing
clause.
however,
this
court
has
noticed
and
recognized
that
a
tax
upon
the
corporate
franchise
or
corporate
privilege
is
permissible
within
the
parameters
of
the
constitution,
even
though
these
federal
bonds
and
interest
may
be
included
within
the
tax
base.
this
principle
was
first
enunciated
by
this
court
in
1867
in
the
case
of
society
for
savings
v.
coite
and
was
subsequently
reaffirmed
in
a
number
of
cases
including
flint
v.
stone
tracy
company
in
1911,
educational
films
corporation
of
america
v.
ward
in
1931,
and
as
recently
as
1956
in
werner
machine
company
v.
director
of
taxation.
now,
the
first
question
the
court
will
face
here
in
applying
our
bank
tax
to
section
742
is
the
type
of
tax
that
we
have.
if
the
court
should
determine
that
this
is
a
direct
property
tax,
then
the
question
of
discrimination
becomes
moot
and
would
be
void.
but
it's
our
position
that
this
is
a
franchise
tax
within
the
meaning
of
the
second
sentence
of
section
742,
which
permits
a
non-discriminatory
franchise
tax.
mr.
jimmy
c.
creecy
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
this
bank
tax
is
imposed
only
against
banks.
we
have
a
general
corporate
excise
tax
and
a
general
corporate
franchise
tax.
now,
the
statute
which
imposes
the
bank
tax
specifically
provides
that
this
tax
is
in
addition
to
any
other
excise
tax
or
any
other
taxes
that
may
be
imposed
against
the
bank.
mr.
jimmy
c.
creecy
well,
i
think
it's
the
effect
of
the
tax
primarily
that's
important.
whether
we
call
this
a
property
tax
or
a
franchise
tax,
a
gross
receipt
tax
or
whatever
is,
to
some
extent,
immaterial.
but
i
think
the
actual
effect
and
operation
of
the
tax
is
important.
mr.
jimmy
c.
creecy
well,
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
term
742
is
a
generic
term.
it
doesn't
include
just,
for
instance,
a
tax
on
corporate
capital.
as
this
court
has
noted
in
several
opinions,
a
franchise
tax
may
include
a
tax
on
net
income.
i
think
the
court
can
quite
easily
rule
that
this
is
a
franchise
tax
within
the
meaning
of
section
742.
now,
there
is
some
language
there
that
says
"or
a
non-property
tax
in
lieu
thereof.
"
on
corporations.
now,
the
court,
i
suppose,
could
take
that
approach
and
say
that
it
is
a
non-corporate...
i
mean,
a
non-property
tax
in
lieu
thereof
imposed
on
corporations.
but
it's
our
position
that
this
is
a
franchise
tax
that
we're
imposing.
of
course,
the
nature
of
the
tax,
rather
than
the
label
attached
to
it,
must
be
determined
by
its
operation
and
effect.
and,
of
course,
this
court
is
not
bound
by
the
characterization
of
the
tax
which
is
placed
on
it
by
the
state
court.
but
this
court
has
noted
in
a
number
of
cases
that
such
interpretation
is
to
be
given
weight
by
this
court
in
determining
the
nature
of
the
tax.
the
tennessee
supreme
court
in
this
case
below
affirmatively
held
that
this
was
an
excise
tax,
and
it
has
done
so
in
other
independent
decisions
before
the
court.
the
fact
that
the
tax
may
be
included
within
our
code
section
that
deals
with
direct
property
taxes,
or
that
it
may
be
denominated
a
tax
in
lieu
of
property
tax
does
not
make
it
a
property
tax,
as
is
suggested
by
the
appellants
in
the
case.
this
court
has
noted
in
the
case
of
tradesmen's
national
bank
of
oklahoma
v.
oklahoma
tax
commissioner
in
1940
that
in
defining
a
franchise
tax,
that
a
franchise
tax
is
a
tax
upon
a
corporation
for
the
exercise
of
its
corporate
privilege
and
franchise
within
the
state,
and
further,
that
this
tax
may
be
measured
either
by
net
income
or
by
net
assets.
and
that
the
two
terms
are
used
interchangeably.
so
when
we
attach
the
label
742.
as
i
stated,
the
tax
is
not
a
property
tax
but
in
tennessee
it's
a
bank
tax
upon
banks
for
the
exercise
of
the
banking
privilege
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
and
for
several
reasons.
article
ii,
section
28
of
our
state
constitution
which
was
amended
in
1973
permits
our
legislature
to
impose
a
tax
upon
banks
and
other
financial
institutions
in
lieu
of
the
intangible
personal
property
tax.
now,
the
tennessee
general
assembly
has
done
this
in
1977
by
this
bank
tax
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute;
it
specifically
identifies
the
tax
as
an
excise
tax,
it
makes
the
tax
imposed
in
addition
to
any
other
excise
taxes
or
any
other
type
of
tax
that
the
bank
may
be
required
to
pay
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
jimmy
c.
creecy
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
under
the
provisions
of
our
law
they
make,
in
lieu
of
tax,
payments
to
the
state
of
tennessee
based
upon
values
as
a
fairly
complicated
formula.
they
do
not
pay
property
tax
per
se
to
the
state.
mr.
jimmy
c.
creecy
because
the
tennessee
valley
authority
is
an
instrumentality
of
the
federal
government,
it's
very
doubtful
that
we
could,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jimmy
c.
creecy
under
the
facts
and
the
situation
of
this
case,
madame
justice,
the
minimum
tax
does
not
come
into
play
because
under
the
minimum
tax
computation
it
is
based
upon
the
book
value...
60
percent
of
the
book
value
of
the
bank
less
the
appraised
value
of
real
or
intangible
personal
property.
in
this
case,
apparently
the
real
or
intangible
personal
property
more
than
wiped
out
any
minimum
tax
that
would
have
been
owed.
so
that's
not
a
question.
mr.
jimmy
c.
creecy
that's
correct.
mr.
jimmy
c.
creecy
the
tax
is
imposed
at
the
rate
of
3
percent
of
net
earnings.
the
amount
of
property
held
by
the
bank
is
totally
irrelevant.
the
value
of
this
property
is
irrelevant.
what
better
way
to
measure
the
exercise
of
a
corporate
franchise
than
the
benefits
that
inures
to
the
corporation
from
this
franchise;
that
is,
the
net
earnings.
although
below,
as
the
appellants
have
contended,
there
was
a
stipulation
in
the
trial
court
with
regard
to
the
amount
of
the
tax
and
the
source
of
the
interest
that
the
tax
was
characterized
as
an
intangible
personal
property
tax,
unfortunately,
but
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
quite
correctly
held
that
this
was
an
excise
tax.
and
that
point
was
raised
below
and
argued
before
the
tennessee
supreme
court.
i
believe
that's
all
i
have,
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
there's
some
questions.
thank
you.
