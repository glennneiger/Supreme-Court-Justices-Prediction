i
thought
the
cases
mr.
worthy
was
quoting
from
indicated
only
that
you
can't
treat
state
bonds
better
than
you
can
treat
federal
bonds.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
intent
make
any
difference
in
this
area?
what
if
the
tennessee
legislature
simply
passes
a
tax
and
decides
that
a,
b,
and
c
should
be
exempt
and
c,
d
and
e
should
be
used
as
the
base
of
the
tax,
and
it
turns
out
that
they
come
out
with
a
product
which,
in
effect,
discriminates
against
the
federal
government
in
mr.
worthy's
context
because
it
taxes
the
revenue
from
federal
securities
but
doesn't
tax
the
revenue
from
state
securities?
why
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
state
of
tennessee
intended
to
single
out
the
federal
government?
