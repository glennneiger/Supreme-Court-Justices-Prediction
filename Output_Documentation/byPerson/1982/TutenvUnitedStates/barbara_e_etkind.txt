ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
the
question
presented
by
this
case,
whether
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
set-aside
of
his
conviction
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act,
is
answered
in
the
negative
by
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
18
u.s.c.
5021(b)
provides
that
a
court
may
unconditionally
discharge
a
youth
offender
from
probation
"prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
maximum
period
of
probation
theretofore
fixed
by
the
court
which
discharge
shall
automatically
set
aside.
"
the
youth
offender's
conviction.
here
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
two
years'
probation
under
the
youth
corrections
act.
it
is
undisputed
that
he
completed
the
entire
probationary
term.
accordingly,
he
was
never
unconditionally
discharged
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
maximum
period
of
probation
theretofore
fixed
by
the
court.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes,
he
would.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
congress'
purpose,
was
to
hold
out
to
youth
offenders
the
possibility
of
a
set-aside
as
an
inducement
to
fully
rehabilitate
themselves
and
to
take--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--well,
i
think...
i
think
it
may
have
to
be
one
day
before.
congress
was
looking
for
some
evidence
of
this
rehabilitation,
and
the
evidence
would
be
an
early
set-aside
whenever
that
would
come,
particularly
in
the
case
of
a
probation
with
a
short
sentence,
it
might
take
nearly
the
whole
sentence
to
rehabilitate.
petitioner
was
never
unconditionally
discharged
prior
to
the
maximum
period
of
probation.
he
therefore
was
never
entitled
to
the
set-aside,
and
the
government
was
fully
intent...
was
fully
entitled
to
use
it
as
a
basis
for
the
subsequent
recidivist
penalty.
petitioner
attempts
to
create
ambiguity
where
none
exists
in
this
statute
by
focusing
on
the
statute's
use
of
the
word
"maximum".
and
on
the
absence
of
any
language
in
the
statute
such
as
"the
sentence
imposed
on
him".
but
it
is
clear
from
the
phraseology
of
the
statute,
the
period
of
probation
theretofore
fixed
by
the
court,
that
congress
was
talking
about
the
sentence
that
would
be
imposed
on
the
defendant.
and
congress
could
not
have
more
clearly
expressed
that
its
use
of
the
word
maximum
referred
to
"the
maximum
period
of
probation
theretofore
fixed
by
the
court.
"
in
addition,
petitioner
now
suggests
that
yca
as
the
maximum.
but
in
fact,
when
a
court
sentences
a
probationer,
the
maximum
to
which
he
can
be
sentenced
under
3651
in
the
federal
courts
and
also
in
the
d.c.
courts
is
five
years'
probation.
so
according
to
petitioner's
theory,
any...
any
probationer
would
ultimately
be
entitled
to
set-aside
relief.
as
i
mentioned
to
justice
blackmun,
it
was
congress'
purpose
in...
in...
in
holding
out
the
possibility
of
a
set-aside
to
induce
probationers,
to
induce
all
youth
offenders,
to
take
advantage
of
the
treatment
and
guidance
that
was
offered
by
the
yca
program.
accordingly,
any
construction
of
the
statute
that
makes
the
availability
of
set-aside
relief
turn
on
the
initial
sentence
as
imposed
would...
would
thwart
that
congressional
purpose.
and
it's
for
that
reason,
as
well
as
the
more
significant
fact
that
its
conclusion
flies
in
the
face
of
the
statutory
language,
that
the
arrington
decision
on
which
petitioner
relies
and
which
is
the
only
decision
contrary
to
the
holding
below
is
of
no
persuasive
force
at
all.
while
the
case...
while
this
case
here
presents...
involves
the
set-aside
provision
applicable
to
probationers,
arrington
involved
the
analogous
set-aside
provision
applicable
to
committed
youth
offenders;
that
is,
incarcerated
youth
offenders.
that
section
provides,
"upon
the
unconditional
discharge
by
the
commission
of
a
committed
youth
offender
before
the
expiration
of
the
maximum
sentence
imposed
upon
him,
the
conviction
shall
be
automatically
set
aside.
"
notwithstanding
this
clear
statutory
language,
the
fifth
circuit
in
arrington
held
that
the
defendant
there,
who
had
completed
his...
the
six-year
sentence
that
was
imposed
upon
him
was
entitled
to
a
set-aside.
that
fifth
circuit
decision
represents
nothing
less
than
a
holding
that
every
defendant
who
is
sentenced
under
the
youth
corrections
act
will
ultimately
be
entitled
to
a
set-aside.
petitioner
complains
that
we
are...
that
we
interpret
the
arrington
decision
too
broadly,
that
really
all
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
holding
was
that
any
youth
offender
who
was
committed
to
a
sentence
less
than
that
to
which
he
could
have
been
committed
will
be
entitled
to
a
set-aside.
but
there
is
no
basis
for
petitioner's
reading
of
the
arrington
decision.
in
the
first
place,
the
fifth
circuit
never
articulated
such
a
limited
ruling.
indeed,
it
never
even
discussed
the
critical
statutory
language
prior...
before
the
expiration
of
the
maximum
term
imposed
upon
him.
and
moreover,
the
petitioner's
reading
of
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
makes
no
sense
at
all,
as
a
hypothetical
will
show.
if
you
take
two
defendants,
both
of
whom
are
sentenced
to
six
years
youth...
to
six
years
under
50...
section
5010(b)
of
the
youth
corrections
act,
one
of
the
defendants
has
committed
a
string
of
murders,
the
other
one
has
been
convicted
of
loitering.
under...
under
petitioner's
reading
of
the
arrington
decision,
the
only
defendant
who
would
be
entitled
to
set-aside
relief
would
be
the
mass
murderer
because
only
he
could
have
been
sentenced
to
a
greater
sentence;
that
is,
under
section
5017(c),
he
could
have
been
sentenced
to
the
maximum...
to
a
youth
offender
sentence
equivalent
to
the
maximum
sentence
an
adult
could
have
received.
but
in
any
event,
either
reading
of
the
arrington
decision
ignores
the
critical
statutory
before
the
expiration
of
the
maximum
sentence
imposed
on
him.
moreover,
either
meaning
makes
the
unavailability
of
set-aside
relief
turn
on
the
sentence
as
initially
imposed,
and
therefore
it
thwarts
the
congressional
purpose
of
it
holding
out
the
set-aside
as
an
inducement
to
the
youth
offenders
to
take
advantage
of
yca
treatment
in
correctional
programs.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
rely
on
our
brief.
