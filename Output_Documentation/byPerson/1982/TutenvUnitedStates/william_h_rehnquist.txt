justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
stuntz,
would
your
second
ground
require
us
to
interpret
differently
than
did
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
a
statute
dealing
primarily
with
local
matters
in
the
district?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
one
way
of
telling
you
that
you
lose,
i
suppose.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
any
rate,
that's
your
second
point,
isn't
it?
i
take
it
you'd
probably
want
to
argue
your
first
point
first.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
the
thought,
ms.
stuntz,
that
if
someone
sentenced
under
the
youth
corrections
act
is
discharged
prior
to
the
term
for
which
they
have
probation,
however
long,
that's
a
recognition
of
kind
of
a
specially
good
rehabilitation,
whereas
if
the
person
simply
serves
out
the
term,
it's
thought
that's
probably
about
as
expected
but
no
big
pluses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
stuntz,
you
say
it
is
not
proper
to
use
it.
do
you
have
some
statutory
frame
of
reference
in
mind
when
you
say
that?
that
the...
is
it
the
general
recidivist
statute
was
not
intended
to
incorporate
it
or
there
is
some
constitutional
problem
or
is
it
a
common-law
observation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--do
you
concede
that
at
least
by
implication
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
has
resolved
the
issue
of
legislative
intent
against
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
the
one
you
want
construed
according
to
the
rule
of
lenity?
