justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
this
case
had
come
to
us
from
new
york
or
illinois
and
the
state
court
had
said,
we
are
going
to
treat
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
as
a
proper
basis
for
a
state
recidivist
penalty.
now,
that
would
clearly
be
an
adequate
state
ground,
wouldn't
it?
and
isn't
that
pretty
much
what
this
court
did?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
we
could
prevent
a
state
court
from
treating
a
youth
corrections
act
conviction
as
a
basis
for
its
own
recidivist
statute?
couldn't
new
york
pass
a
statute
that
says
a
second
conviction
will
result
in
an
enhanced
penalty
and
we
shall
for
this
purpose
treat
any
federal
conviction
whether
youth
or
adult,
as
a
first
conviction?
they
could
do
that,
couldn't
they?
