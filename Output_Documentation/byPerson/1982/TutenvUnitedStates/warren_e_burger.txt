justice

burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
tuten
against
the
united
states.
ms.
stuntz,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
an
independent
state
ground
for
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
that
pretty
close
to
what
has
happened
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
say
they--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--didn't
articulate
it
that
way,
but
that's
the
net
effect
of
the
result
reached,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
the
fresh
start
concept
fit
an
acknowledged
recidivist
now,
going
to
the
policy
underlying
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assuming...
assuming
he
was
entitled
to
some
special
consideration
for
his
first
offense,
what
justification
is
there
for
any
special
consideration
for
him
for
the
second
offense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
not--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--do
not
judges
in
sentencing
take...
use
hindsight
to...
suppose
a
judge
were
totally
free...
this
is
not
directly
related
to
your
case...
but
suppose
the
judge
were
entirely
free,
don't
you
think
a
judge
would
treat
him
as
a
second
offender
if
there
were
none
of
the
points
you
raise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
judge
is
going
to
look
at
the
total
record.
he
looks
at
a
sentencing
probation
report,
presentence
report,
and
he
finds
the
person
has
committed
other
offenses.
now,
suppose
he
had
committed
an
offense
but
had
not
been
prosecuted
for
one
reason
or
another.
wouldn't
the
judge,
any
sensible
judge
making
the
sentence,
take
that
into
account?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
prevent
judges
from
taking
it
into
account?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
when
it's...
even
when
it's
practically
the
same
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
etkind,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
ms.
stuntz?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
tuten
against
the
united
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
marshall.
