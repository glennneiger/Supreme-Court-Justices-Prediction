ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
involving
the
application
to
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
of
section
5021(b)
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
of
1950
and
section
3204
chapter
22
of
the
district
of
columbia
code,
in
particular
a
provision
of
that
section
multiplying
by
a
factor
of
ten
the
penalty
for
repeat
offenders.
these
provisions
are
set
forth
at
pages
2
and
3
of
petitioner's
brief.
the
question
before
the
court
is:
whether
petitioner
may
be
sentenced
as
a
recidivist
under
section
3204
based
on
a
conviction
for
which
he
served
a
sentence
of
2
years
of
probation
pursuant
to
section
5010(a)
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
and
was
granted
an
unconditional
discharge.
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
answered
a
similar
question
in
the
negative
is
in
conflict
with
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
the
court
below,
which
answered
this
question
in
the
affirmative.
petitioner
maintains
that
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
is
in
error
and
that
his
sentencing
as
a
recidivist
was
improper
for
two
independent
reasons:
number
one,
his
earlier
federal
youth
corrections
act
conviction
was
set
aside
pursuant
to
section
5021(b)
when
he
received
his
unconditional
discharge;
and
number
two,
whether
or
not
it
was
technically
set
aside
pursuant
to
section
5021,
it
is
not
a
proper
basis
upon
which
to
impose
a
recidivist
penalty
under
section
3204.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
on
february
12,
1971,
petitioner,
then
19
years
of
age,
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
general
sessions
to
the
charge
of
carrying
a
pistol
without
a
license,
in
violation
of
22
d.c.
code
section
3204.
the
imposition
of
sentence
was
suspended,
and
petitioner
was
placed
on
probation
under
section
5010(a)
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
for
a
period
of
2
years.
contrary
to
established
probation
department
procedures,
petitioner's
term
of
probation
was
allowed
to
expire
without
judicial
attention
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
should
have
been
discharged
prior
to
the
end
of
his
two-year
term.
at
the
end
of
his
term
in
1973
petitioner
was
granted
an
unconditional
discharge.
however,
no
certificate
was
issued
setting
aside
his
conviction
pursuant
to
section
5021(b)
of
the
youth
act.
on
june
19,
1980,
a
two-count
indictment
was
filed
charging
petitioner
with
assault
with
a
dangerous
weapon,
a
stick,
and
carrying
a
pistol
without
a
license,
after
having
been
previously
convicted
of
carrying
an
unlicensed
pistol.
both
offenses
were
allegedly
committed
on
november
23,
1979.
prior
to
petitioner's
trial,
the
government
informed
the
court
below,
pursuant
to
d.c.
law,
that
petitioner
had
previously
been
convicted
of
carrying
a
pistol
without
a
license
and
was
therefore
subject
to
the
increased
recidivist
penalty
provided
by
section
3204.
the
previous
conviction
relied
upon
by
the
government
was
the
same
1970
offense
for
which
petitioner
had
been
sentenced
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
on
november
27,
1980,
a
jury
found
petitioner
not
guilty
of
assault
with
a
stick
but
guilty
of
carrying
a
pistol
without
a
license.
on
january
26,
1981,
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
a
felony
term
of
not
less
than
two
nor
more
than
six
years.
had
he
been
sentenced
as
a
first-time
offender
pursuant
to
section
3215
of
the
d.c.
code,
the
maximum
sentence
that
he
could
have
been
given
is
one
year
imprisonment.
petitioner
appealed
his
sentence
as
contrary
to
section
5021(b)
of
the
youth
act
and
of
the
construction
placed
on
that
section
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
united
states
versus
arrington.
however,
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
it
found
arrington
to
be
based
on
unpersuasive
authority
and
held
that
under
section
5021(b)
only
those
youth
offenders
who
are
unconditionally
discharged
by
a
court
prior
to
completing
a
youth
act
probationary
sentence
are
entitled
to
have
their
convictions
set
aside.
the
court
concluded
that
a
conviction
which
was
not
set
aside
was
a
proper
basis
for
the
recidivist
sentence
that
petitioner
received.
on
october
12,
1982,
this
court
granted
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
decision
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
the
gist
of
petitioner's
argument
is
that
the
use
of
his
1971
federal
youth
act
conviction
to
trigger
the
felony
recidivist
penalty
contained
in
section
3204
of
the
district
of
columbia
code
was
improper
on
two
independent
grounds:
first,
the
1971
conviction
had
been
automatically
set
aside
pursuant
to
section
5021(b)
by
petitioner's
unconditional
discharge
from
probation;
and
second,
whether
or
not
it
was
technically
set
aside,
it
may
not
properly
be
used
to
trigger
a
recidivist
penalty.
i
would--
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
--mr.
justice,
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
as
i
understand
its
treatment
of
that
issue,
which
was
very
perfunctory,
felt
it
was
not
a
matter
for
its
determination
as
a
court,
but
that
the
issue
was
better
addressed
to
congress.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
involved
any
alteration
of
their
interpretation.
they
did
not
approach
the
question
that
fully.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
your
honor,
since
it...
since
this
question
involves
the
interrelationship
of
both
statutes,
it
would
be
petitioner's
position
that
there
would...
could
be
no
independent
state
ground
since
it
necessarily
involves
the
construction
of
both
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
and
the
district
of
columbia
provision.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
to
the
extent
that
that
interpretation
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act,
which
is
plainly
a
matter
for
this
court's
purview,
differed
with
a
matter
of
this
court's
interpretation,
i
should
think
it
would
not
be
an
adequate
state
ground.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
they
could.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
that
is
not
the
primary
basis
for
this
court's
decision
below--
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
--as
i
understand
it.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
it
may
be,
but
as
applied
to
this
particular
case,
but
i
believe
the
precedential
value
that
this
case
would
set
in
terms
of
its
construction
of
the
youth
act
section
5021(b)
and
when
set
aside
occurs
would
have
an
impact
far
beyond
this
particular
jurisdiction.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
will
proceed
to
that.
the
government
contends
that
the
language
of
section
5021(b)
is
entirely
clear
and
compels
the
conclusion
that
a
youth
act
conviction
will
be
set
aside
only
when
the
youth
has
been
discharged
prior
to
the
expiration
of
his
probationary
sentence.
petitioner
was
not
discharged
prior
to
the
end
of
his
2-year
probationary
term.
therefore,
the
government
reasons
in
the
court
below,
that
this
conviction
was
not
set
aside.
however,
section
5021(b)
does
not
provide
for
the
set-aside
of
the
conviction
of
a
youth
offender
who
is
discharged
before
the
expiration
of
his
sentence
or
whatever
sentence
it
is
that's
imposed
upon
him.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
that
automatic
set-aside
shall
be
granted
to
those
youth
offenders
who
are
discharged
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
maximum
period
of
probation,
theretofore
fixed
by
the
court.
now,
as
with
any
question
of
statutory
construction,
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
history,
structure,
and
underlying
policies
of
the
youth
act
itself,
at
least
briefly
because
i
know
the
court
is
familiar
with
these
matters,
to
see
those...
what
those
who
drafted
this
language
intended
to
do.
in
its
exhaustive
review
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
in
dorszynski
versus
united
state,
this
court
found
that
the
principal
purpose
of
the
youth
act
is
to
rehabilitate
persons
who
because
of
their
youth
are
especially
vulnerable
to
the
dangers
of
recidivism.
in
furtherance
of
this
principal
purpose,
sentencing
judges
were
authorized
to
choose
from
a
variety
of
sentencing
options.
under
section
5010
of
the
act
a
youth
offender
may
be
committed
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
for
a
period
up
to
six
years
or
such
longer
commitment
as
may
be
authorized
for
an
adult
violator.
the
youth
offender
may
also
be
placed
on
probation
with
the
execution
or
imposition
of
his
sentence
suspended.
or
the
youth
may
be
sentenced
as
an
adult
should
the
court
find
he
would
not
benefit
from
the
youth
act
treatment.
the
drafters
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
provided
a
powerful
tool
to
the
youth
act
division
to
be
used
in
achieving
this
principal
rehabilitative
purpose.
this
was
the
division's
discretion
to
discharge
committed
persons
unconditionally
before
it
was
statutorily
required
that
they
do
so
under
the
act
because
upon
such
discharge
the
conviction
of
the
youth
would
be
automatically
set
aside.
it
was
this
provision,
section
5021(a),
that
was
before
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
united
states
versus
arrington.
there
the
court
held
that
a
youth
offender's
unconditional
discharge
after
satisfactorily
completing
a
six-year
sentence
under
section
5010(b)
of
the
youth
act
set
aside
his
conviction
under
section
5021(a).
as
a
result,
the
offender
could
not
be
convicted
of
violating
the
federal
law
which
prohibits
the
possession
of
firearms
by
a
convicted
felon,
18
u.s.c.
section
1202.
citing
the
court's
decision
in
dorszynski,
the
fifth
circuit
stated,
if
a
youthful
offender
has
been
unconditionally
discharged,
the
disabilities
of
a
criminal
conviction
are
completely
and
automatically
removed.
indeed,
the
conviction
is
set
aside
as
if
it
never
had
been.
the
government
would
have
the
court
discard
arrington
as
an
aberration,
not
based
upon
a
complete
reading
of
section
5021.
according
to
the
government
and
the
courts
below,
arrington's
conviction
was
not
set
aside
because
arrington
was
not
released
prior
to
the
end
of
his
youth
act
sentence.
the
fifth
circuit
determined,
however,
that
because
arrington
was
given
a
sentence
less
than
that
which
he
could
have
been
given,
his
unconditional
discharge
following
the
completion
of
that
lesser
term
earned
him
the
set-aside
of
his
conviction
under
section
5021(a).
the
fifth
circuit's
construction
of
section
5021
is
true
to
the
distinctive
character
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
as
a
tool
of
rehabilitation
rather
than
one
of
retribution.
petitioner's
case
is
even
stronger
than
john
arrington's.
arrington
had
been
committed
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
under
section
5010(b)
and
had
received
unconditional
discharge
after
completing
the
six-year
maximum
term
provided
by
section
5010(b).
petitioner,
on
the
other
hand,
received
unconditional
discharge
after
serving
a
probationary
term
of
only
two
years.
now,
when
the
youth
corrections
act
was
enacted,
no
provision
whatever
was
provided
whereby
youths
placed
on
probation
rather
than
committed
could
obtain
the
set-aside
of
their
convictions.
this
waited
until
1961
when
section
5021(b)
was
added
to
extend
the
same
conviction
set-aside
benefits
to
youths
serving
youth
act
probation
as
had
been
available
to
youths
committed
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
unlike
the
terms
of
commitment,
however;
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
specifies
no
maximum
term
of
probation
at
the
end
of
which
unconditional
discharge
must
occur,
nor
does
it
provide
for
mandatory
conditional
release
prior
to
the
end
of
that
maximum
term
as
is
the
case
for
committed
youth
offenders.
the
government
contends
that
according
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
the
youth
must
be
released
prior
to
the
term
of
probation
initially
imposed
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
set-aside
of
his
conviction.
this
reading
of
the
statute,
however,
ignores
the
term
5021
both
(a)
and
(b)
for
a
reason.
the
reason
is
to
provide
a
benchmark
by
which
the
youth
eligibility
for
the
set-aside
of
his
conviction
can
be
measured.
unconditional
discharge
prior
to
that
benchmark
grants
automatic
set-aside.
what
is
the
maximum
term
of
probation
theretofore
fixed
as
is
discussed
in
petitioner's
reply
brief?
this
is
not
an
easy
question
to
answer.
petitioner
maintains,
however,
that
the
drafters
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
intended
unconditional
discharges
occurring
before
six
years
or
such
longer
period
as
an
adult
term
may
provide
to
carry
with
it
the
set-aside
of
the
conviction
underlying
that
term.
acceptance
of
the
government's
contention
would
lead
to
a
number
of
anomalous
results.
an
offender
discharged
before
the
end
of
an
extended
period
of
probation
would
be
treated
better
than
one
discharged
at
the
end
of
a
brief
initial
period
of
probation.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
precisely
why
the
statute
was
written
as
it
was,
to,
as
the
government
puts
out
and
as
petitioner
agrees,
reward
not
just
average
adjustment
but...
but
good
behavior,
special
response
to
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
program.
there
is,
however,
in
the
language
of
the
statute
the
term
"maximum",
in
recognition
of
the
anomalies
that
may
result
were
a
person
discharged
after
two
years
not
allowed
the
set-aside
of
his
conviction
and
yet
a
person
discharged
after
five
years
allowed
that
set-aside.
the
term
"maximum",
which
relates
back,
petitioner
contends,
to
the
six
years
in
the
original
statute,
provides
a
solid
benchmark
by
which
all
behavior
under
federal
youth
corrections
act
treatment
may
be
measured,
especially
in
this
case
where
there
never
was
an
opportunity
for
petitioner
to
be
discharged
before
the
end
of
his
two-year
probationary
term
due
to
the
failure
of
the
probation
department
to
alert
the
sentencing
judge
to
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
probation.
the
government's
interpretation
of
section
5021(b)
violates
the
foremost
intent
of
the
drafters
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act:
to
rehabilitate
those
youths
who
can
be
reached
by
giving
those
who
respond
to
federal
youth
corrections
act
treatment
a
fresh
start.
turning
now
to
the
second
independent
grounds
for
reversal--
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
--the
question--
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
--your
honor,
i
agree
that
the
benefit
of
hindsight
often
would
change
the
application
of
a--
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
--search
warrant
or...
or--
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the--
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
--i
think
that
is
precisely
why,
your
honor,
the
set-aside
provision
was
inserted
and--
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
--that...
whether
or
not
the
set-aside
completely
expunges
the
record
is
an
issue
which
has
not
yet
been
finally
adjudicated
by
the
court,
this
court
or
even
the
courts
below.
they
are
in
disagreement
on
that
matter,
and
i
do
not
believe
it
is
an
issue
that
needs
to
be
determined
today.
but
the
question
is
not
whether
petitioner's
commitment
of
a
crime
years
later
somehow
goes
back
and...
and
disqualifies
him
from
the
set-aside
of
his
conviction.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
whether...
whether
it
is...
whether
or
not
it
is
the
same
crime,
your
honor,
the
question
before
the
court
is
did
he
qualify
pursuant
to
the
statutory
criteria
set
out
in
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
that
he
committed
a
crime
years
later
is...
is
unfortunate.
and
the
judge
at
that
time
has
the
right
to
use
his
sentencing
discretion
in
whatever
way
he
deems
best.
the
question
here
is
was
that
conviction
on
the
books
at
the
time
the
judge
ten
years
later
when
the
second
crime
was
committed.
petitioner's
position
is,
according
to
the
language
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
and
as
arrington
held,
that
conviction
was
set
aside
and
was
not
available
to
be
used
to
trigger
the
increased
recidivist
penalty.
turning
to
the
second
independent
grounds
for
reversal,
petitioner
argues
that
whether
or
not
his
conviction
was
set
aside,
it's
not
proper
to
use
it
as
the
basis
upon
which
to
impose
a
recidivist
penalty.
federal
youth
corrections
act
convictions
are
very
different
kinds
of
creatures.
youths
may
be
sentenced
to
longer
terms
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
than...
than
may
an
adult.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
your
honor,
i
rely
primarily
upon
the
rule
of
lenity.
there
is
no
legislative
intent
that
in
the
d.c.
code
section
3204
that
federal
youth
corrections
act
convictions
be
counted
there.
in
the
absence
of
such
legislative
intent,
it
has
been
the
long-held
doctrine
of
this
court
that
the
imposition
of
a
harsher
penalty
which
presumes
such
intent--
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
--is
improper.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
has
certainly,
at
least
by
implication,
resolved
the
issue
of
the
legislative
intent
of
section
3204.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
what
i
am
asking
the
court
is
not
just
3204
but
also
the
federal
youth
corrections
act,
because
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
policies
of
both
acts
to
determine
whether
applying
them
together,
as
they
were
in
this
case,
makes
sense
and
serves
the
policies
of
either
one.
it
is
petitioner's
position
that
such
use
does
not.
in
conclusion...
and
i
would
respectfully
ask
that
the
remainder
of
my
time
be
available
for
rebuttal--
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
--petitioner
would
ask
that
for
these
reasons
and
the
reasons
set
forth
in
his
briefs,
the
decision
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
and
that
his
felony
sentence
be
vacated
and
his
case
remanded
for
resentencing
pursuant
to
section
3215
of
the
d.c.
code
as
a
first
offender.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
that's
correct,
justice.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
that's
correct.
ms.
linda
gillespie
stuntz
thank
you,
your
honor.
petitioner
does
not
maintain
that
any
probationer
would
be
entitled
to
set-aside
relief.
as
the
justice
pointed
out,
it
is
plain
that
congress
was
looking
for
evidence
of
rehabilitation
and
that
this
was
necessary
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
set-aside
of
the
conviction.
it
was
not
to
be
a
benefit
indiscriminately
bestowed
upon
everyone
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
in
looking
for
the
evidence
of
rehabilitation,
the
government
would
suggest,
according
to
a
strict
reading
of
all
of
the
statute
except
one
word,
that
it
must
have
happened
one
day
or
five
days
or
any
time
prior
to
the
period
of
that
probationary
term.
aside
from
the
fact
that,
as
we
know
in
this
case,
there
never
was
even
an
opportunity
for
that
to
happen,
this
turns
the
rehabilitative
purposes
of
the
act
on
its
head.
the
more
reasonable
reading,
more
in
line
with
the
policy
of
the
act,
a
more
better
gauge
of
evidence
of
rehabilitation
would
be
was
the
petitioner,
was
the
youth
offender
discharged
prior
to
the
six
years
under
which...
specified
in
section
5010(b)
of
the
act?
if
the
court
would
determine
that
in
fact
the
maximum
is
the
five-year
probationary
term
provided
in
the
federal
probation
statute,
that
would
be
acceptable
as
well.
but
there
is
most
definitely
a
reference
in
the
statute
to
some
maximum
as
the
benchmark.
this
is
to
how
the
evidence
of
rehabilitation
is
to
be
determined.
and
only
if
that
evidence
is
demonstrated
would
set-aside
be
in
order.
in
this
case,
that
evidence
is
demonstrated.
and
petitioner
would
urge
that
conviction
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
be
reversed.
thank
you.
