this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
the
case
concerns
the
provision
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
which
governs
the
sentencing
of
defendants
who
are
under
the
age
of
22
at
the
time
of
their
conviction.
section
502
(1)
of
the
act
allows
certain
youth
offenders
who
were
sentenced
under
the
act
to
let
--
to
have
their
convictions
set
aside.
this
set
aside
provision
were
designed
and
to
promote
the
rehabilitation
of
youth
offenders
by
providing
an
incentive
for
them
to
behave
positively
while
serving
a
sentence
under
the
act.
in
1971,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
then
under
19
years
of
age
was
placed
on
probation
for
two
years
under
the
youth
correction
act,
had
been
pleaded
guilty
to
the
charge
of
carrying
a
pistol
without
a
license.
at
the
end
of
the
full
two-year
term,
he
was
discharged
from
probation.
and
in
1980,
petitioner
again
was
convicted
of
carrying
a
pistol
without
a
license.
this
time,
he
was
sentenced
under
the
district
of
columbia
code
as
a
recidivus
on
the
basis
of
his
prior
conviction.
on
appeal,
petitioner
contended
that
his
earlier
conviction
could
not
be
taken
into
account
of
sentencing
because
his
conviction
had
been
expunged
under
the
youth
correction
act.
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
rejected
this
argument
and
upheld
petitioner's
sentence
and
we
affirm.
section
502
(1)(b)
of
the
act
provides
that
where
youth
offender
has
been
placed
on
probation,
his
conviction
will
be
set
aside
if
the
court,
“unconditionally
discharges
such
youth
offender
from
probation
prior
to
expiration
of
the
maximum
period
of
probation
therefore
fixed
by
the
court.”
we
hold
that
a
conviction
will
not
be
set
aside
under
this
provision,
whereas
in
this
case,
the
sentence
he
has
not
exercised,
rather,
the
sentencing
court
has
not
exercised
this
discretion
to
discharge
a
youth
offender
prior
to
the
expiration
of
his
term.
this
interpretation
is
compelled
by
the
language
of
the
provision
and
its
legislative
history.
it
is
fully
consistent
with
the
congress'
intent
to
use
the
set
aside
as
an
incentive
for
positive
behavior
by
youth
offenders.
accordingly,
petitione's
previous
conviction
was
not
expunged
and
the
trial
court
was
free
to
take
the
conviction
into
account
whether
to
impose
sentence.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
thereby
affirmed.
