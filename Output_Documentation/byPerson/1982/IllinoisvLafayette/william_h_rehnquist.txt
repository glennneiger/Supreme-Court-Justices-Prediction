justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
an
argument
might
be
waived,
does
it,
the
fact
that
the
two
constitutions
might
be
coterminous?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
assuming
we
ought
to
take
the
word
of
the
illinois
appellate
court
in
this
particular
case
on
these
particular
facts
as
to
whether
something
was
waived
under
illinois
law,
shouldn't
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
jenkins
v.
georgia
which
the
other
side
relies
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
custodial
nature
of
an
arrest
made
for
a
violation
of
that
ordinance?
is
it
totally
unknown
to
make
a
custodial
arrest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
the
sort
of
a
record
upon
which
this
court
could
say
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
you
have
to
inventory
one
way
rather
than
another?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
do
not
reach
the
question
of
opening
up
letters
in
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
do
not
have
to
take
in
haec
verba
either
your
submission
or
petitioner's,
i
take
it,
to
decide
the
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
opperman?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
justice
white's
hypothetical
be
controlled
by
sanders
and
chadwick
rather
than,
which
you
consider
to
be
extensions,
rather
than
by
robinson
for
purposes
of
search
incident
to
arrest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
letting
the
custodian
deal
with
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
letting
the
custodian
deal
with
them.
let
the
attorney
general
get
in
there.
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
did.
it
was
not
the...
the
burden
was
on
your
client
to
show
that
the
evidence
should
be
suppressed,
i
take
it,
and
that
would
be
the
rule
in
illinois
as
elsewhere,
and
if
you
were
to
make
a
claim
that
could
be
sustained
on
appeal,
it
is
up
to
you
to
make
the
record
that
would
justify
sustaining
the
claim.
if
the
illinois
appellate
court
upholds
that
claim
on
the
basis
of
a
record
that
will
not
support
it,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
is
you
who
suffer
and
not
the
other
side.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
rule
is
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
defeat
a
motion
to
suppress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
talking
about
the
waiver
argument
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
sorry.
i
misunderstood
you.
