justice
harry
a.
blackmun
without
getting
into
all
this
steagald
underbrush,
didn't
your
illinois
appellate
court
go
on
and
say
and
reach
the
issue
anyway--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--by
saying
that
we
assume
arguendo
that
it
was
not
waived
and
then
went
ahead
and
decided
it.
is
that
enough
for
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
have
not
mentioned
it
in
so
many
words.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
did
they
indulge
in
that
waste
of
time?
