mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fourth
amendment,
through
the
requirement
of
warrants
based
upon
probable
cause,
seeks
to
protect
citizens
and
their
effects
from
governmental
intrusions
by
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
but
not
all
searches
and
seizures
without
warrant
offend
the
limits
imposed
by
the
fourth
amendment.
we
submit
that
illinois
v.
lafayette
is
one
such
case
that
does
not
offend
the
limits
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
urge
this
court
to
find
that
the
delayed
search
at
the
station
house
of
the
purse
of
the
respondent,
ralph
lafayette,
after
a
valid
custodial
arrest
was
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
this
post-arrest
warrantless
search
was
permissible
both
as
incidental
to
arrest
and
as
a
valid
inventory
search.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
yes,
your
honor,
that
argument
was
made
in
the
trial
court.
although
in
one
line
of
the
appellate
court
opinion,
the
appellate
court
found
that
it
was
waived,
the
court
went
on
to
discuss
the
issue
citing
ross,
belton,
sanders,
chadwick,
edwards,
and
then
in
its
conclusion
in
the
holding
of
the
case
the
court
said
that
we
find
that
this
search
is
not
incidental
to
arrest
and
thus
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
so
under
jenkins
v.
georgia,
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
reached
and
decided
the
constitutional
issue.
the
fact--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--there
are
three
ways
that
this
case
is
before
this
court.
one
is
on
the
theory
of
valid...
the
inventory
search
which
was
not--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--although
they
said
that
under
jenkins
v.
georgia,
they
reached
the
issue.
the
question
of
waiver,
whether
or
not
this
is
an
independent
and
adequate
ground...
this
is
not
an
independent
ground,
the
issue
of
waiver.
the
illinois
courts
follow
procedural
and
substantive
laws
to
find
under
the
fourth
amendment.
in
people
v.
clark,
in
appellate
courts,
people
v.
renke,
the
courts
of
illinois
have
said
that
their
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
coextensive
with
the
scope
of
the
federal
interpretation
by
this
court
of
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
the
illinois
courts
follow
the
procedural
rules,
so
this
court
under
the
holdings
of
steagald
which
establishes
the
standard
for
waiver
in
illinois...
the
illinois
courts
in
people
v.
keller
which
explicitly
says
we
follow
the
federal
guideline
of
steagald
for
the
waiver
principles,
thereby
allows
this
court
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
waived.
by
a
clear
examination
of
the
record
in
this
case,
the
issue
was
not
waived
although
the
appellate
court
in
one
simple
sentence
said
it
was
waived.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
i
believe,
your
honor,
it
is
not
an
independent
ground
because
they
use
the
federal
standard
of
waiver
in
steagald,
and,
therefore,
in
applying
the
federal
standard
in
steagald
this
issue
was
not
waived
because
it
was
raised
in
a
timely
fashion.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
that
is
enough
under
jenkins
v.
georgia
if
they
reach
the
constitutional
issue
and
more
significantly--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--i
apologize
to
the
court.
i
thought
that
was
my
first
reference.
but
what
they
have
said
is,
in
applying
the
principles
of
the
supreme
court
cases,
we
find
that
this
was
not
a
search
incidental
to
arrest.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
on
september
1
a
sergeant
of
the
kankakee
city
police
was
called
to
a
disturbance
at
a
movie
theater
in
kankakee.
upon
his
arrival
he
saw
the
respondent
at
the
theater
having
words
with
the
theater
manager.
as
he
approached
the
theater
manager,
the
manager
requested
that
the
sergeant
file
a
complaint
against
the
respondent,
ralph
lafayette,
for
disorderly
conduct.
sergeant
mitzner
tried
to
straighten
out
the
matter
there,
in
his
own
words,
but
the
respondent
continued
yelling
and
screaming
and
sergeant
mitzner
then
placed
him
under
arrest,
did
not
search
him
at
that
time,
handcuffed
him,
took
him
to
his
car,
and
brought
him
to
the
police
station.
at
the
police
station
the
respondent
was
unhandcuffed
and
taken
into
the
booking
room
where
the
standard
police
booking
procedure
began.
the
respondent
was
told
to
remove
his
clothing,
to
put
on
jail
garb,
to
take
the
things
out
of
his
pockets,
and
he
began
filling
out
forms.
then,
according
to
sergeant
mitzner,
the
petitioner
or
the
respondent
placed
his
purse
on
the
counter
before
him,
took
out
a
pack
of
cigarettes.
the
sergeant
touched
that
purse,
felt
something
inside
and
reached
in.
according
to
the
petitioner,
the
purse
was
taken
from
his
shoulder
and
searched.
but
it
was
uncontested
that
inside
that
purse
at
the
time...
after
a
valid
custodial
arrest,
were
ten
amphetamine
pills.
a
motion
to
suppress
was
heard,
was
taken
under
advisement
by
the
trial
court.
twenty
days
after
being
taken
under
advisement,
the
state
filed
a
brief
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
suppress.
the
appellate
court
then
affirmed
the
holding
of
the
trial
court
suppressing
the
evidence.
leave
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
was
denied,
and
this
matter
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
reasonableness
of
a
post-arrest
warrantless
search
of
the
respondent's
purse
is
predicated
upon
the
right
of
the
state
to
search
the
respondent
after
his
valid
custodial
arrest
for
disorderly
conduct.
the
validity
of
sergeant
mitzner's
authority
to
search
this
individual
after
the
arrest
has
remained
virtually
unchallenged
in
this
court.
as
this
court
noted
in
robinson,
the
right
to
search
is
not
to
be
doubted.
the
arrest
is
a
reasonable
intrusion
as
this
court
has
said
in
the
initial
stage
of
prosecution
which
may
lead
to
the
ultimate
relinquishment
of
liberty
of
this
individual.
when
sergeant
mitzner
observed
the
respondent's
disorderly
conduct
and
arrested
him
for
that,
ralph
lafayette's
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
contents
of
his
purse
became
subordinated
to
the
legitimate
and
overriding
interests
of
the
state
to
search
that
purse.
those
interests,
as
stated
in
this
court,
that
are
monitored
by
police
officers
each
day
are
the
interests
to
disarm
the
person
arrested,
to
protect
the
police
officers
and
those
around
them,
to
remove
the
means
of
escape
from
the
arrested
person,
and
to
prevent
destruction
of
evidence
that
can
be
used
against
the
person
arrested.
now
these
interests
that
were
monitored
by
sergeant
mitzner
were
not
tailored
specifically
for
ralph
lafayette.
these
are
the
interests
served
in
every
arrest
and
search
incidental
thereto.
the
interests
served
are
not
the
justification
for
the
search
of
ralph
lafayette.
the
valid
custodial
arrest
as
this
court
has
indicated
is
the
justification
for
that
search,
and
the
search
needs
no
further
justification.
the
breadth
of
authority
to
search
is
not
limited,
as
this
court
has
held,
by
the
crime
arrested
for.
despite
the
trivial
nature
of
a
crime
that
a
police
officer
arrests
an
individual
for,
an
officer
never
knows
if
he
is
facing
the
infamous,
as
this
court
put
it,
trojan
horse.
it
is
of
no
moment
to
a
post-arrest
warrantless
search
that
there
may
be
an
absence
of
the
fruits
of
the
crime
arrested
for
or
no
evidence
of
the
crime
that
can
be
seized
in
relation
to
the
crime,
although
in
this
case
the
bizarre
behavior
of
the
respondent
could
have
been
found
in
the
evidence
of
amphetamines
found
in
his
purse.
the
justification
to
search
is
not
based
upon
the
probability
of
finding
weapons
and
evidence
and
means
of
escape
in
each
and
every
case,
but
is
based
upon
the
valid
custodial
arrest.
the
state's
interests
to
be
protected
after
a
valid
custodial
arrest
are
constant
whether
or
not
in
a
hindsight
glance
we
can
say
that
the
interests
were
unlikely
to
have
been
served
in
that
particular
search
incidental
to
arrest.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
he
was
arrested
for,
your
honor,
disorderly
conduct
which
was
a
city
ordinance
which
was
subject
to
incarceration.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
i
do
not
believe
that
is
an
issue,
your
honor.
however
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
the
evidence
of
his
bizarre
behavior
may
have
resulted
from
the
use
of
narcotics,
in
this
case
amphetamines.
so
in
this
particular
case
there
could
be
established
evidence
of
his
bizarre
behavior,
that
his
yelling
and
screaming
in
a
public
place
and
acting
as
what
is
described
as
disorderly
in
this
specific
case.
it
was
conceded
by
the
respondent
if
sergeant
mitzner
arrested
him
at
the
movie
station,
he
could
have
conducted
a
search
contemporaneous
with
that
arrest,
but
because
the
search
was
at
the
station,
the
respondent
says
it
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
the
court
has
ruled
in
united
states
v.
abel
that
a
valid
custodial
arrest
can
justify
a
search
in
a
place
other
than
the
place
of
arrest,
and
the
court
has
allowed
a
delay
of
ten
hours
in
a
search
after
a
valid
custodial
arrest,
in
edwards.
the
delayed
station
house
search
in
this
case
does
not
change
the
fact
that
the
arrest
justifies
the
search.
it
does
not
impose
on
ralph
lafayette
in
any
manner
greater
than
it
would
have
imposed
upon
him
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
at
the
movie
house.
it
does
not
enlarge
the
scope
of
permissible
search
of
ralph
lafayette.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
question
is
if
it
is
pursuant
to
a
valid
custodial
arrest,
the
police
have
a
right
to
examine
the
contents,
not
to
read
the
contents
of
the
letters,
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
other
decisions,
that
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
scrutiny
available
to
the
police.
what
is
reasonable
and
what
may
shock
the
conscience
by
a
broaching--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--i
believe
they
could,
your
honor,
and
it
is
the
arrest
that
justifies
this
intrusion
because
the
expectation
of
privacy
of
an
arrested
individual
is
diminished
and
the
contents
of
his
personal
belongings
are
also
diminished.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
i
believe
they
would,
your
honor,
in
this
case
under
these
facts
because
the
valid
custodial
arrest,
just
like
searching
into
the
pocket
of
robinson
to
find
a
cigarette
pack
and
then
opening
a
cigarette
pack
to
find
narcotics
inside
would
be
the
same
as
the
court's
example
or
hypothetical
to
me.
allowing
searches
incidental
to
arrest
at
a
place
other
than
and
a
time
other
than
the
arrest
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
based
upon
the
practical
considerations
that
a
police
officer
has
to
face
every
day.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
no,
your
honor,
that
is
the
first
submission.
the
reasonableness
of
what
a
police
officer
does
in
light
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case
is
the
basis
of
this
practical
consideration
the
court
has
in
allowing
a
search
at
a
place
other
than
and
at
a
time
other
than
arrest.
the
court
has
found
warrantless
searches
reasonable
that
took
place
seconds
after
the
arrest
as
in
lavinson
and
gustafson,
minutes
later
as
in
belton,
or
hours
later
in
edwards.
what
these
searches
incidental
to
arrest
share
in
common
with
the
search
of
ralph
lafayette
is
the
reasonableness
under
all
the
circumstances
of
the
time
and
place
of
the
search.
looking
through
this...
looking
at
this
search
rather
through
the
eyes
of
sergeant
mitzner,
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
and
impractical
for
him
to
conduct
a
search
in
a
movie
theater
lobby
where
he
had
been
called
to
quell
the
disturbance,
where
a
disturbance
was
taking
place,
where
the
defendant
may
have
other
friends
or
associates
among
the
patrons
of
the
theater.
it
was
unreasonable,
and
the
court
has
recognized
this
unreasonableness
in
demanding
that
the
search
incidental
to
arrest
be
at
the
time
and
place
of
the
search
incident.
now
the
respondent
also
concedes
that
the
arrest
in
this
case
was
valid.
now
the
court
has
reasoned
in
robinson
that
a
search
into
a
pocket
to
get
a
pack
of
cigarettes
and
then
searching
the
cigarette
pack
to
get
a
container
crushed
around
narcotics
is
reasonable.
then
in
this
case
the
search
into
a
purse
after
a
valid
custodial
arrest
to
take
out
a
cellophane
with
narcotics
in
it
is
also
reasonable.
both
the
pocket
and
the
purse
are
repositories
of
personal
effects.
there
can
be
no
distinction,
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
ross,
between
worthy
and
unworthy
containers
in
relation
to
the
unreasonableness
of
a
search
and
seizure
in
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment.
when
sergeant
mitzner
placed
the
respondent
under
arrest
in
that
lobby,
the
respondent
had
a
diminished
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
contents
of
his
purse
because--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
everything
on
his
person
and
within
the
scope
of
allowable
search,
under
chimel.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
it
depends
upon
the
association
of
that
locked
trunk
with
the
person
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
but
we
do
not
have
to
reach
that
issue
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--if
it
were
in
the
permissible
scope
of
chimel
if
chimel
is...
if
the
language
of
chimel
means
a
foot
locker.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
if
that
is
what
the
interpretation
of
chimel
means,
even
if
it
is
locked.
under
the
valid
custodial
arrest
theory,
there
is
really
no
distinction
between
going
into
someone's
pocket
and
a
foot
locker
that
they
are
carrying
down
the
street.
but
in
chadwick
that
issue
was
not
addressed
because
it
was
not
a
search
incidental
to
arrest.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
the
encounter
began
in
an
observation
in
another
city,
i
believe,
but
the
arrest
took
place...
there
was
probable
cause
to
search--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--based
upon
observations
by
agents
in,
i
believe,
san
diego
following
it
through
to
boston
where
the
foot
locker
was
observed.
a
dog
was
used
to
verify
the
presence
of
narcotics--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--that
was
unclear,
your
honor,
but
that
issue--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--that
issue
was
not
addressed.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
i
believe
within
the
holding
of
chimel
that
foot
locker
could
have
been
searched
as
valid,
incident
to
a
custodial
arrest.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
court
in
their
language
of
chadwick
meant
closely
associated
with
the
person
to
be
a
foot
locker,
but
certainly
under
this
situation
a
purse
is
an
item
both
closely
associated
with
the
person
as
well
as
within
the
scope
of
chimel.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
but
i
believe
this
court
has
distinguished
chadwick
in
that
it
was
not
a
search
incidental
to
arrest.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
that
is
correct.
so
then
based
upon
the
necessity
for
probable
cause
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
chadwick,
the
court's
holding
in
relation
to
the
search
of
that
item
was
correct.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
i
believe
ross
merely
indicated
the
worthiness
and
unworthiness
of
containers
for
the
purposes
of
describing,
as
i
have,
a
purse
or
a
double
locked
foot
locker.
it
is
the
nature
of
the
container...
it
is
not
the
nature
of
the
container
that
retains
the
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
container.
it
is
what
is
done
with
that
container,
it
is
our
position,
that
reduces
the
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
no,
your
honor,
i
will.
the
search
of
the
respondent's
purse
at
the
station
house
after
his
valid
arrest
was
a
post-arrest
warrantless
search
of
property
under
his
control
and
immediately
associated
with
his
person.
the
authority
to
seize
was
not
questioned
by
the
respondent.
the
justification
to
search
is
based
upon
the
valid
custodial
arrest.
the
search
of
the
purse
was
also
justified
as
a
valid
inventory
search
because
the
respondent
was
carrying
it
when
the
police
took
him
into
custody.
when
sergeant
mitzner
reached
into
that
purse,
his
stated
intent
was
to
conduct
an
inventory
search
according
to
standard
police
booking
procedures.
this
court
has
said
in
opperman--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--we
do
not
know
from
the
record,
your
honor,
other
than
the
facts
of
removing
the
contents
from
the
pockets
of
the
individual,
placing
this
individual
in
jail
garb
or
jail
attire,
and
taking
all
the
personal
belongings
of
that
individual
in
inventory.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
before
the
court,
there
is
a
copy
of
the
inventory
form
used
by
the
kankakee
police
department
which
line
by
line
designates
questions
to
be
answered
and
items
to
be
inventoried
and
property
to
be
received
and
that
the
respondent
in
each
and
every
case
or
the
person
arrested
must
sign
that
inventory
to
verify
the
contents.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
the
inventory
process,
your
honor,
mr.
justice,
is
a
caretaking
administrative
practice.
it
is
not
based
upon
the
probable
cause,
but
it
is
based
upon
serving
the
legitimate
interests
of
the
state
as
well
as
an
arrestee.
the
interests
served
are
those
listed
in
opperman,
to
protect
the
valuables
of
the
arrestee
from
theft,
loss
or
damage,
to
protect
also
the
police
officer
from
any
harm
due
to
the
contents
of
that
property
seized.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
subjective
fear
of
a
particular
police
officer.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
objective
harm
that
may
occur
if
that
item
and
the
contents
are
not
inventoried.
the
interests
served
by
inventory
include
protecting
against
false
claims
that
the
property
of
the
arrestee
was
either
stolen,
damaged,
or
lost
by
the
police,
and
this
cannot
be
underestimated,
the
problem
this
causes
both
in
morale
and
in
the
drain
of
resources
in
responding
to
frivolous
claims
by
persons
arrested.
we
cannot
also
deny
the
fact
that
an
interest
served
by
the
inventory
search
of
an
arrestee
is
to
secure
the
security
of
the
jail
cell
or
the
jail
house.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
i
believe
that
is
the
inventory
card.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
it
is
not
clear
from
the
record,
your
honor,
where
those
keys--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--if
that
would
not--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--that
is
their
regular
procedure.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
i
do
not
think
it
is
of
significance
whether
it
is
in
the
pouch
or
not.
the
significance
is
whether
it
remains
the
property
of
this
arrestee.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
i
believe
in
the
record
it
indicates
that
every
item
of
property
of
an
arrestee
must
be
inventoried.
that
would
include
by
its
very
nature
the
contents
of
the
pouch.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
i
do
not
believe
that
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor,
in
that
they
inventoried
all
items
of
personal
property
in
his
possession.
it
did
not
have
to
indicate
from
where
those
items
came
because
it
serves
no
purpose.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
you
mean
they
do
not
specifically
indicate
that
the
contents
are
the
following?
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
but
they
do,
which
is
the
basic
consideration,
inventory
each
and
every
item
taken
from
the
arrestee
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
i
believe
you
would
have
to
look
into
the
pouch
or
you
cannot
list
each
and
every
item
taken
from
the
arrestee
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
in
weighing
the
state's
interests
in
the
respondent's
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
contents
of
his
purse,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
respondent
who
is
a
pre-trial
detainee
has
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy
that
justifies
the
overriding
state
interests
to
search
and
inventory
the
contents
of
that
purse.
i
would
seek
leave
of
this
court
to
retain
the
remaining
portion
of
my
argument
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
brief
response,
mr.
chief
justice.
whether
we
wish
to
call
this
a
search
incidental
to
arrest
or
a
valid
inventory
search,
the
search
is
based
upon
the
validity
of
that
arrest,
and
the
justification
then
is
existent
in
an
inventory
search
the
same
as
it
is
in
the
search
incidental
to
arrest.
when
justice
white
addressed
the
question
of
what
do
we
do
with
the
wallet,
if
we
follow
the
counsel's
least
restrictive
rules
test,
we
must
ignore
that
there
are
10
million
arrests
annually
that
involve
custodial
taking
of
a
person
into
custody
or
taking
him
into
custody.
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
in
the
united
states--
mr.
michael
a.
ficaro
--according
to
the
fbi
uniform
crime
statistics,
although
at
times
it
seems
that
there
are
that
many
in
chicago.
[laughter]
if
we
take
counsel's
less
intrusive
means
test,
we
do
not
balance
the
state's
interests
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
pre-trial
detainee
whose
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
contents
of
his
purse
or
wallet
have
been
severely
restricted.
so
we
must
balance
the
state's
interest
to
search
as
provided
for
in
the
interest
named
in
opperman
versus
the
rights
of
a
pre-trial
detainee.
and
finally
as
this
court
has
questioned
the
waiver
issue
by
the
state,
the
importance
in
my
statement
of
facts
and
the
relation
to
a
brief
being
filed
after
the
court
took
this
matter
under
advisement
in
the
trial
court
was
that
the
state
raised
this
issue
of
search
incident
to
arrest
eight
days
before
the
court
decided
this
matter,
and,
therefore,
it
was
timely
raised
in
the
trial
court
below.
thank
you
very
much.
