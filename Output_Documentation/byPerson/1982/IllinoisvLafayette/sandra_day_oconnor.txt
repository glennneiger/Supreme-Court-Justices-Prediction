day
o'connor
now,
mr.
ficaro,
you
did
not
make
that
search
incident
to
an
arrest
argument
below,
did
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
a
separate
locked
trunk
as
in
chadwick:
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--you
mean
if
it
were
nearby
it
could
be
opened
and
searched?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
it
is
locked?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
know
from
the
record
in
this
case
what
the
details
of
the
standard
procedure
were
that
were
used
by
the
kankakee
police
department?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
do
not
know
to
what
property
it
extends
or
whether
a
form
is
filled
out
or
anything
of
the
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
the
person
arrested
had
to
sign
the
form
and
say
i
acknowledge
this
is
what
i
had
and
here
it
is
and
you
have
listed
it
on
the
inventory
and
yes
that
is
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
that
does
not
do
away
with
the
type
of
claim
the
chief
justice
was
inquiring
about.
