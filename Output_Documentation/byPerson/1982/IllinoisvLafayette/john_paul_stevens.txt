john
paul
stevens
before
it
got
to
the
end
of
its
opinion
on
page
3a
of
the
cert
petition
it
said
we
find
the
state
has
waived
this
argument
for
the
purposes
of
appeal
by
falling
to
raise
it
at
the
suppression
hearing.
don't
we
have
to
take
that
at
face
value?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
this
only
goes,
as
justice
o'connor's
question,
only
to
the
question
of
search
incident
to
arrest.
on
that
they
say
in
so
many
words
you
waived
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
the
scope
of
the
permissible
search?
supposing
that
the
purse
that
this
man
was
carrying
contained
a
lot
of
letters
in
envelopes,
some
of
which
were
sealed
and
some
were
not.
could
the
police
open
and
read
the
mail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
the
envelopes
were
sealed,
could
they
rip
open
the
seals
and
look
inside?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
is
this
the
inventory
card
that
was
used
in
this
case?
is
that
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
describes
the
property
as
b-l-k,
black
shoes,
$79
u.s.c.,
brown
pouch,
three
keys,
pants,
i
guess,
vest,
and
something
else.
does
this...
the
three
keys,
is
that
within
the
pouch
or
are
they
three
keys
outside
the
pouch?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
tell
what
was
in
the
pouch
from
the
inventory
card?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
just
inventory
the
pouch
and
i
assume
they
leave
the
contents
inside
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
this
is
their
regular
procedure,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
cannot
tell
from
the
card
what
is
in
the
pouch
and
what
is
not
in
the
pouch?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
other
side
argues
that
all
you
really
have
to
do
is
describe
the
pouch
and
keep
that
separate,
and
you
are
arguing
you
have
got
to
know
what
is
in
the
pouch--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
if
the
ordinary
record
does
not
even
show
what
is
in
the
pouch,
i
wonder
how
valid
your
argument
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
he
had
a
pouch
with
nothing
in
it
but
three
keys?
they
did
not
even
inventory
the
drugs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
am
saying
they
apparently
do
not
inventory
the
contents
of
the
pouch.
they
just
inventory
the
pouch
as
one
item.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
this
is
your
regular
form,
they
do
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
including
the
pouch
but
not
the
contents
of
the
pouch,
which
would
seem
to
suggest
you
do
not
have
to
look
inside
the
pouch
to
comply
with
your
inventory
regulations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
the
record
tells
us
what
he
had
in
the
purse
other
than
the
cigarettes,
which
i
guess
are
mentioned,
and
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
neither
the
cigarettes
nor
the
drugs
are
listed
on
the
card.
was
there
anything
else
in
the
purse?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
sure
it
is
right
to
call
that
a
hypothetical,
that
alternative
ground,
because
they
were
subject
to
review
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
which
might
have
disagreed
with
them
on
waiver
so
they
had
a
perfectly
good
reason
for
putting
another
reason
in
the
record
if
they
wanted
to
avoid
review
by
their
superior
court.
