justice
byron
r.
white
is
incident
to
arrest
your
principle
submission?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that...
in
chadwick
didn't
the
encounter
begin
when
they
were
standing
in
the
depot
or
the
station?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
where?
where
was
there
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
soon
as
the
dog
sniffed
the
foot
locker,
where
were
the
people
when
the
dog
sniffed
the
foot
locker?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
close
by,
weren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
could
have...
suppose
the
dog
had
sniffed
the
foot
locker
when
they
were
sitting
on
the
foot
locker
and
they
arrested
them
right
then.
could
you
have
searched
the
foot
locker?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
won't
push
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
you
say?
suppose
right
at
the
time
of
arrest,
would
they
have
been
able
to
search
the
purse?
justice
byron
r.
white
so--
justice
byron
r.
white
--all
right.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
if
the
arrestee
has
in
his
pocket
a
little
box
that
is
wrapped
up
with
strings,
it
looks
like
a
little
box
with
a
present
in
it
or
something,
would
the
police
be
permitted
to
open
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
how
about
his
wallet?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
get
him
into
the
station.
they
have
arrested
him
and
take
him
to
the
station
house
and
they
tall
him
to
empty
his
pockets
and
he
does,
and
there
is
his
wallet,
and
you
say
they
just
must
put
the
wallet
in
a
bag
and
not
look
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
isn't
the
wallet
like
the
cigarette
package
in
robinson?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
saying...
what
case
is
it
that
holds,
do
you
think,
that...
you
would
think
that
if
they
arrested
him
out
on
the
street
corner
they
could
then
search
his
wallet.
they
take
it
out
of
his
pocket
and
search
him
right
then
and
there,
and
say
this
is
a
search
incident
to
arrest.
now,
you
say
that
is
permissible,
and
they
find
this
little
package
in
his
pocket
when
the
arrest
him
out
on
the
street.
may
they
search
the
box
right
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
because
of
incident
to
arrest,--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
they
would
not
have
to
have
probable
cause
or
anything
to
believe
anything
is
in
the
box.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
tell
me
the
case
that
says
that
with
respect
to
a
personal
article
that
is
intimately
connected
with
a
person
like
a
wallet
that
could
be
searched
in
the
field,
the
arrest
was
in
the
field.
tell
me
the
case
that
says
you
cannot
search
that
at
the
station
house
if
you
have
not
searched
it
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
chadwick
carefully
put
aside
those
items
that
were
intimately
connected
with
the
person
and
did
not
say
that
those
could
not
be
searched
at
the
station
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
you
it
would
not
make
any
difference
if
they
had
a
probable
cause
to
search
the
purse?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
just
say
they
would
have
to
go
get
a
warrant.
you
would
not
say
they
could
make
a
warrantless
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
are
you
talking
about?
the
state?
you
say
state
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
have
the
state
represented
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
state
gets
a
judicial
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
the
illinois
court,
though,
said
even
if
it
was
not
waived
this
is
not
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
it
did
not
talk
about
illinois
law
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
it?
i
would
think
it
certainly
could
have
avoided
a
lot
of
talk
about
federal
law
if
it
was
controlled
by
an
illinois
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
your
court
said
it
had.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
it
nevertheless
decided
the
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
they
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
it
was
not
waived,
it
nevertheless...
we
reject
the
state's
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
did
not
say
a
word
about
illinois
law
during
that
discussion.
