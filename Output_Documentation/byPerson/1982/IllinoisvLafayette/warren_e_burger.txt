we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
illinois
against
lafayette.
mr.
ficaro,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
in
feeling
the
envelopes
they
felt
some
kind
of
a
granulated
powder
inside.
it
might
be
sugar,
and
it
might
be
salt,
and
it
might
be
narcotics.
would
they
be
able
to
open
that
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
limited
to
the
purse
or--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--diminished
expectation
of
privacy
of
everything
on
his
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
chadwick
the
police
did
not
know
of
any...
of
the
connection
between
chadwick
and
the
foot
locker
until
he
exercised
dominion
over
it--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--by
taking
possession,
and
the
police
deferred
their
arrest
until
he
claimed
the
container
that
the
dog
had
indicated
had
drugs
in
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
was
not
an
automobile
search.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
ross
case
possibly
have
some
impact
on
chadwick?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
going
to
come
to
your
theory
on
the
inventory
search--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--or
have
you
said
all
you
were
going
to
say
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
in
the
course
of
the
inventory
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
carusona.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
have
said,
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
that
the
police
would
not
even
have
been
able
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
for
that
bag
that
he
was
carrying.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if,
in
fact,
there
was
$20,000
worth
of
raw
heroin
in
it
and
the
police
do
not
know
that
when
they
arrest
him
but
his
conduct
was
such
that
they
might
reasonably
think
he
was
influenced
by
drugs.
are
you
telling
us
that
under
illinois
law
there
was
no
way
that
the
police
could
ever
search
that
shoulder
bag
to
see,
either
to
inventory
it
or
for
any
other
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose...
you
are
suggesting
that
they
should
have
put
it
in
a
sealed
wrapper
and
put
it
away
and
not
looked
inside
of
it.
that
is
part
of
your
point,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
suppose
after
he
posted
his
bond
and
had
been
fined
he
then
claimed
that
he
had
had
$10,000
in
currency
in
it
but
that
the
$10,000
in
currency
was
missing.
are
you
suggesting
the
police
did
not
have
the
right
to
protect
themselves
from
such
a
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
prevent
this
gentleman
from
claiming
afterward
that
he
had
$10,000
when
he
put
it
in,
that
the
$10,000
was
missing
when
he
was
released?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
inventory
at
the
time
and
place
at
the
police
station,
spreading
the
things
all
out
on
the
table
and
counting
the
money
would
protect
them,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
not
the
function
of
judges
to
try
to
say
how
it
should
be
done.
the
only
function
of
this
court
would
be
to
say
is
the
way
they
are
doing
is
the
procedure
they
are
following,
a
reasonable
procedure
given
all
the
circumstances.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
opperman
we
said
that
an
inventory
search
is
a
constitutional
means
for
several
purposes,
one
of
which
is
the
protection
of
the
police
from
false
claims,
but
that
is
only
one
of
the
purposes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
take
you
back
to
the
wallet
that
justice
white
postulated
to
you.
a
man
puts
the
wallet
down
on
the
table,
and
you
say
they
must
wrap
that
up
in
some
kind
of
a
seal
and
not
look
inside
of
it.
all
right,
they
do
that.
two
days
later
he
is
released
and
they
hand
him
his
billfold
and
ask
him
to
sign
a
receipt.
he
looks
at
it
and
said,
well,
i
had
$10,000
in
here
when
i
left
it,
and
now
there
is
only
$3.
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
they
cannot
inventory
the
contents
of
that
wallet
in
order
to
protect
the
police
from
that
kind
of
a
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
that
is...
you
are
running
counter
to
opperman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
entire
of
everything
in
the
automobile
including
things
that
were
in
the--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--glove
compartment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
also
to
protect
the
police.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
washington
just
recently
a
young
man
was
arrested
and
he
had
a
package
and
it
was
discovered
that
there
were
two
venomous,
poisonous
snakes
which
had
inflicted
very
serious
injury
on
him
endangering
his
life.
now
would
you
suggest
that
police
should
not
have
done
a
little
checking
on
that,
the
contents
of
that
bag?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
case
it
was
a
translucent
bag,
and
they
could
see
what
was
there,
but
suppose
it
had
been
a
bag
that
was
not
translucent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
whole
point
is
that
he
might
not
have
any
reason
to
think
there
was
a
bomb
or
a
poisonous
snake
any
more
than
you
would
have
any
reason
to
think
there
was
$10,000
in
the
man's
wallet,
but
is
it
not
the
business
of
the
police
to
find
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
embarrassing.
the
young
man
nearly
died
as
a
result
of
this.
fortunately,
the
policeman
knew
what
to
do
with
the
snake,
but
i
think
the
chief
justice
means
if
an
ordinary
policeman
had
put
his
hand
in
there
he
would
be
dead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ficaro,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
chicago
do
you
mean
or--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--the
united
states--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
