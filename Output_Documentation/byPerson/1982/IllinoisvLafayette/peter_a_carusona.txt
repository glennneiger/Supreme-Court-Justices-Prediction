mr.
peter
a.
carusona
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner,
the
state
of
illinois,
asks
this
honorable
court
to
reverse
the
decision
on
two
grounds.
it
alleges
two
grounds,
that
it
is
a
valid
inventory
in
this
case,
or
there
is
a
valid
delayed
search
incident
to
the
arrest.
it
is
our
position
as
developed
in
part
two
of
our
brief
that
the
question
of
whether
the
search
can
be
justified
as
one
incident
to
the
arrest
is
not
properly
before
this
court
since
the
appellate
court
held
that
that
issue
was
waived.
the
fact
that
after
the
court
held
that
it
was
waived,
as
the
state
concedes
in
both
its
petition
for
certiorari
and
its
brief,
and
then
went
on
to
note
and
discuss
the
issue,
that
is
purely
a
hypothetical
discussion
prefaced
with
the
phrase,
assuming
arguendo,
that
the
state
had
not
waived
the
issue.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
it
is
just
common
for
them
to
do
that.
[laughter]
not
to
waste
their
time,
but
to
go
on
to
discuss
that.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
thank
you.
hypothetical
discussions
do
occur
perhaps
even
in
this
court's
decisions,
but
in
herb
v.
pitcairn
that
is
one
case
where
this
court
recognized
that
there
was
a
hypothetical
discussion
in
the
case,
as
there
was
in
this
case,
and
the
court
said
that
we
are
not
in
the
business
of
issuing
advisory
opinions.
any
opinion
by
this
court
would
be
purely
advisory
since
it
was
waived
under
state
law.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
in
that
case
the
court
in
that
case
went
on
to
reach
and
decide
the
question.
there
is
nothing
in
there
to
the...
there
is
no
waiver
holding
in
that
case.
there
is
no
question
that
that
case
was
decided
on
the
merits
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
the
constitution.
since
the
focus
of
this
case
really
should
be
inventory,
i
would
like
to
limit
my
comments
to
that.
i
would
rely
on
part
three
of
our
brief
where
we
discuss
the
search
incident
to
arrest
question,
and
there
is
another
reason
in
this
case
why
the
focus
of
the
case
should
be
on
inventory.
that
is
what
the
facts
show
it
is.
the
officer
testified
he
searched
the
contents
of
this
shoulder
bag
because,
pursuant
to
kankakee
police
department
policy,
everything
had
to
be
inventoried.
as
your
honors
will
recall,
there
was
an
arrest
in
this
case,
and
i
must
dispute
the
facts
as
supported
by
the
petitioner
this
morning.
the
arrest
in
this
case
was
for
disturbing
the
peace.
it
was
not
subject
to
incarceration.
that
was
a
petty
offense
punishable
by
a
fine
only.
it
was
a
violation
of
the
kankakee
municipal
code,
and
petty
offenses
in
illinois
are
punishable
by
fine
only.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
certainly
not,
your
honor,
and
this
is
the...
you
can
have
a
custodial
arrest
for
a
misdemeanor,
and
this
is
not
even
a
misdemeanor.
it
is
even
lower.
it
is
simply
a
petty
offense
carrying
no
subject
of
incarceration.
in
fact,
there
is
a
bail
schedule
for
this
offense,
and
the
defendant
could
have
obtained
his
release
by
posting
$35
bond
money.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
if
he
had
it.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
that
regard,
there
has
been
some
discussion
this
morning
of
his
property
index
card
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus.
that
is
not
in
the
record.
that
card
apparently
was
obtained
by
the
amicus
writing
to
the
kankakee
police
department.
that
is
not
evidence
in
the
record,
and
i
wanted
to
point
that
out.
but,
however,
that
card
indicates
that
he
did
have
$79
and
enough
to
make
bond.
following
the
arrest
in
this
case--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--the
record
does
not
show.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record.
following
the
arrest
in
this
case,
the
defendant
was
taken
down
to
the
police
station.
at
that
point,
he
was
allowed
to
fill
out
some
forms.
after
he
filled
out
some
forms
it
eventually
was
determined
that
he
was
going
to
spend
the
night
in
jail
or
going
to
spend
some
time
in
jail.
they
took
all
of
his
belongings,
and
at
that
point
they
decided
that
they
were
going
to
search
them
because
they
were
safeguarding
them.
i
would
like
to
point
out
what
this
search
is
not,
in
this
case.
this
is
not
a
search
based
on
probable
cause.
this
is
not
a
search
based
on
any
exigency.
this
is
not
a
search
of
any
property
that
was
going
to
accompany
the
defendant
into
the
jail
cell.
what
this
is
is
simply
a
search
pursuant
to
the
kankakee
police
department
policy
to
inventory
everything
that
they
are
going
to
be
safeguarding,
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
this
is
not
a
search
which
could
ever
be
justified
by
a
warrant.
with
respect
to
this
inventory
question,
the
state--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--perhaps
as
a
search
incident
to
arrest
under
the
fourth
amendment,
yes.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
we
are
not
disputing
a
contemporaneous
search.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
i
might
add,
however,
that
such
a
search
might
be
illegal
under
illinois
law
because
it
is
controlled
by
state
statute.
with
respect
to
this
inventory
question,
the
state
asked
the
court
to
fashion
a
rule
which
requires
the
police,
just
as
the
kankakee
police
department
policy,
to
open
up
every
container,
every
repository
of
personal
effects,
and
this
would
have
to
include
an
envelope
because
you
would
have
to
open
up
an
envelope
to
check
to
see
whether
or
not
there
was
currency
in
it
or
some
type
of
bearer
bond.
our
position,
on
the
other
hand,
is
that
this
court
should
approve
or
affirm
the
decision
in
this
case
and
approve
the
majority
rule
and
that
is
that
the
contents
of
these
containers
should
not
be
searched
as
part
of
an
inventory.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
what
we
are
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
such
a
search
would
not
be
an
inventory
search.
that
would
be
a
criminal
search,
and
it
would
have
to
go
by
the
court's
normal
standard
and
perhaps
the
warrant
would
apply
as
in
chadwick.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
as
far
as
the
inventory
issue
is
concerned.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
what
we
are
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
the
right...
the
police
do
have
a
right
to
protect
themselves
from
a
claim,
and
they
could
have
done
it
exactly
as
the
officer
testified
in
this
case
by
placing
the
shoulder
bag
in
an
inventory
bag,
which
were
available,
and
securing
it
in
a
locker.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
your
honor,
absolutely
no
procedure
would
prevent
that
from
happening.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
would
not
protect
a
false
claim.
i
mean,
a
claim
could
be
made
at
that
time
that
the
money
was
taken
when
it
was
handled.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
well,
your
honor,
in
this
case
the
shoulder
bag
could
have
been
placed
in
an
inventory
bag
and
that
could
have
been
sealed
and
the
defendant
could
have
initialed
that
and
then--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--i
understand.
perhaps
your
honors
may
even
feel
that
it
is
slightly
better
to
search
every
thing,
but
that
slight
interest
cannot
outweigh
the
privacy
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
and,
in
fact--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--i
agree
with
your
honor.
in
a
majority
of
the
jurisdictions
today
they
do
not
search
these
contents.
they
do
not
search
the
contents
of
these
containers.
they
are
the
ones
that
are
faced
with
these
false
claims,
and
they
do
not
find
them
significant.
for
the
moment
or
during
this
discussion
we
have
been
assuming
that
they
are,
in
fact,
significant.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
feel
that
that
interest
is
served
exactly
as
the
majority
of
courts
have
been
holding.
it
is
better
served
by
simply
putting
it
in
a
bag
and
initialing
it.
they
find
that...
actually
the
courts
are
saying
that
claims
are
more
likely
when
the
contents
are
handled,
and,
in
fact,
in
regard
to
whether
that
is
a
significant
risk
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
is
a
significant
risk
in
this
case.
the
state
has
cited
some
federal
cases
in
their
reply
brief,
but
none
of
those
involve
a
claim
from
a
container
and
most
of
them
involve
property
taken
from
someone's
cell,
not
property
which
was
being
stored.
the
evidence
that
it
is
not
significant
comes
from
two
supreme
courts
and
that
is
minnesota
and
delaware,
excuse
me,
and
wisconsin
where
the
courts
have
indicated
that
they
have
never
seen
such
a
claim.
they
were
sure
they
existed,
but
they
had
never
heard
of
one.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
certainly
not,
your
honor.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
do
that.
what
we
are
asking
in
this
case
is
to
apply
the
balancing
test
of
opperman
and
that
is
what
is
the
need
to
search
and
balance
that
against
the
high
privacy
interest
involved,
and
there
is
no
need
to
search
to
prevent
these
false
claims.
even
if
there
is
a
slight
need
or
even
if
it
is
better
by
having
some
type
of
rummaging
through
letters
and
everything,
and
as
i
said
you
would
have
to
open
up
a
letter
to
check
it
and
read
papers
to
make
sure
they
were
not
a
stock
certificate
or
some
type
of
bearer
bond--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
that
is
the
rule
that
the
petitioner
is
advocating.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
no,
your
honor.
we
are
saying
that
they
should
not
be
able
to
open
any
container.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
the
same
goes
to
that,
your
honor.
again,
we
are
talking
about
containers
which
the
police
have
in
their
custody,
and
the
defendant
is
going
off
to
jail.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
well,
robinson
was
a
search
incident
to
arrest
case,
and
it
involved
a
contemporaneous
search.
it
was
a
criminal
search.
we
are
not
talking
about
any
type
of
criminal
search
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
sometimes
they
can,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
right.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
is
correct.
under
robinson
in
search
incident
to
arrest,
we
excuse
the
need
for
the
moment
because
actually
as
justice
frankfuter--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--we
would
submit
as
far
as
search
incident
to
arrest
goes
that
that
would
be
controlled
by
sanders
and
chadwick.
i
realize
that
it
is
an
extension
of
those
cases
perhaps.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
opperman
for
inventory
purposes,
we
submit
that
opperman
does
not
allow
opening
containers
that
are
to
be
stored
in
the
station
house.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
because
robinson
is
a
case
which
allows...
there
is
no
need.
there
is
no...
there
has
to
be
no
justification
other
than
the
fact
of
arrest.
in
other
words--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--there
is
some
language
in
chadwick
to
that
effect,
but
it
is
our
position
that
that
just
applies
to
clothing.
there
is
no
need
for
this
court
to
make
any
kind
of
container
rule
on
clothing,
and,
in
fact,
i
think
as
the
chief
justice
wrote
in
sanders
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here
and
that
is
that
items
carried
on,
accompanied
or
being
carried
by
the
person
when
they
are
arrested
that
a
search
of
those
items
cannot
be
justified
by
any
reduced
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because
we
feel
that
they
are
protected
by
sealing--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
you
are
running
counter
to
opperman.
opperman
allowed
the
search
of
an
automobile--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--glove
compartment.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
there
was
essential
need
in
that
case.
in
fact,
the
state
courts...
this
is
the
reverse
of
opperman.
the
state
courts
have
said...
in
opperman,
the
majority
said
the
search
was
essential.
why?
because
of
the
need
to
protect
from
vandalism.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
idea
was
that
a
car
is
stored
outside.
that
involves
significant
burdens.
there
are
two
key
factors
why
the
courts
have
not
found
opperman
to
extend
to
this
situation,
and
again
one
is
the
significantly
higher
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
contents
of
these
repositories,
and
the
second
one
is
that
it
involves
no
burden
to
secure
them.
in
this
case
they
simply
put
it
in
a
locker.
an
automobile,
on
the
other
hand,
is
subject
to
vandalism,
and
when
there
is
vandalism
that
is
when
false
claims
are
even
more
likely
because
you
have
an
insurance
fraud
type
claim.
but
the
idea
of
the
security
of
the
station
house
and
this
higher
expectation
of
privacy
is
what
has
made
the
scales
tip
the
other
way.
again,
we
are
talking
about...
the
test
here
is
the
need
to
search
versus
the
privacy
interest
involved,
and
we
must
consider
as
one
of
those
factors
the
scope
of
the
search,
and
as
i
pointed
out
the
state's
search
is
virtually
unlimited
in
scope.
the
scope
of
their
rule
is
unlimited.
another
interest
which
has
been
advanced
is
normally
the
idea
that
you
have
to
protect
the
police
from
injury
and
so
on.
in
other
words,
that
interest,
too,
is
served
by
securing
the
property
in
a
locker.
once
you
have
secured
the
property
in
the
locker,
you
have
maintained
jail
security.
you
have
protected
the
owner's
property
from
theft
and
vandalism.
you
have
also
protected
the
police
from
the
idea
that
someone
is
going
to
obtain
a
weapon
from
the
container
and
use
it
against
the
police.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
probable
cause
would
be
a
different
case,
your
honor.
it
would
not
be
an
inventory
case.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
if
there
were
probable...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
if
there
were
probable
cause
to
search
for
contraband,
this
case
would
be
controlled
by
chadwick
and
sanders
at
the
station
house
now.
again,
this
is
something
that
is
securely
in
their
control.
but
once...
we
are
not
suggesting
that
there
cannot
be
a
search
for
these
other
reasons
once
you
get
out
of
inventory
context.
one
example
is
the
idea
that
there
is
a
bomb
in
every
type
of
container.
that
is
true.
every
container
is
a
potential
bomb.
however,
it
is
very
remote
that
the
defendant
would
have
planned
his
arrest
with
a
bomb
in
there
and
secondly,
we
have
to
understand
that
it
is
foolhardy
to
routinely
open
up
containers
looking
for
a
bomb
because
it
may
be
booby-trapped,
and
you
would
have
one
injured
officer.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
certainly,
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
wise--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--if
the
officer
has
reason
to
think
that
there
is
a
poisonous
snake
in
there
or
any
other
dangerous
instrumentality--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
submit
it
would
be
foolhardy
to
open
up
a
container
where
a
snake
jumps
out
and
bites
you.
[laughter]
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
he
should
not
be
opening...
he
is
better
protected
by
putting
it
in
a
locker.
[laughter]
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
it
is...
i
do
not
know
how
else
to
answer
this
potential
bomb
or
potential
dangerous
instrumentality
except
to
say
that
it
is
foolhardy
to
routinely
open
these
up
and
how
it
should
be
dealt
with
is
if
there
is
a
reasonable
suspicion
then,
of
course,
he
should
do
something.
he
should
not
open
it
up.
he
should
have
an
expert
come
and
take
it.
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
talk
a
little
about
the
waiver
question
in
this
case
and
that
is
review
of
the
search
as
incident
to
the
arrest
should
be
precluded
because
the
appellate
court
rejected
that
theory
on
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
which
served
legitimate
state
interest,
and
as
i
noted
the
court's
discussion
was
purely
hypothetical.
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
here
that
are
extreme
legitimate
state
interests
in
this
case.
we
have
the
normal
state
interest
that
there
is
an
inadequate
record.
we
do
not
know
exactly
what
this
container
is.
it
is
called
a
shoulder
bag
or
a
purse.
we
do
not
know
the
exact
circumstances
at
the
time
of
the
search
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
in
the
middle
of
taking
off
his
clothes--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--that
is
right.
the
waiver
rule
serves
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
the
legitimate
state
interest
served,
your
honor,
is
that
the
courts
should
not
be
deciding--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--a
judicial
interest
as
the
interest
that
this
court
recognizes
in
tyler.
it
is
a
judicial
interest.
they
should
not
decide
cases
on
piece
meal
litigation
or
with
an
inadequate
record.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
is
not
the
rule
in
illinois,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
the
burden
on
the
state
is
to
raise
questions
in
a
timely
fashion.
the
defendant
walked
into
the
hearing
in
this
case
with
a
case
in
his
hand,
and
that
was
people
v.
bayles,
an
inventory
case.
the
discovery
says
this
was
an
inventory
search.
he
did
everything
he
had
to
do
to
win.
had
the
state
brought
up
this
question,
he
could
have
asserted
the
state
statute
which
controls
this
question.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
the
important
legitimate
state
interest
here
is
that
he
could
have
asserted
a
state
statute.
searches
incident
to
arrest
in
illinois
are
controlled
by
statute,
and
in
a
strikingly
similar
case,
people
v.
helm,
decided
by
the
supreme
court,
the
illinois
supreme
court,
they
held
that
a
search
almost
identical
to
this
one
violated
that
statute.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
went
on
to
hypothetically--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--there
was
no
need
for
the
court
to
talk
about...
i
mean,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
in
the
trial
court
we
were
denied
our
opportunity
to
present
that
statute.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
in
the
appellate
court
we
contended
that
the
state
had
waived
the
theory--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
we
did
not
decide
the
question,
your
honor,
and,
in
fact,
the--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--exactly
what
the
state
says
they
said,
and
they
held
that
it
was
waived
and
then
they
went
on
to
note--
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
--that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
a.
carusona
i
think
your
honor
brings
up
a
good
point,
and
that
is
that
in
the
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
the
state
did
not
raise
the
waiver
question.
in
fact,
they
never
disputed
the
waiver
contention
until
the
brief
that
they
filed
in
this
court,
and
that
is
something
that
this
court
noted
in
tyler
was
significant.
with
respect
to
this
search
incident
to
arrest
question,
it
is
our
position
that
we
must
look
at
what
justice
frankfuter
stated
in
united
states
v.
rubinowitz
and
that
is
that
the
exception
has
its
basic
root
on
need,
and
there
was
no
need
to
conduct
a
search
in
this
case.
that
need
exists
at
the
time
of
arrest
as
in
robinson,
but
once
the
item,
the
container,
is
secured
at
the
station,
is
in
custody
of
the
police
that
there
is
no
need
then
to
conduct
a
search
for
that
reason.
and
if
we
just
facially
look
at
this
case
compared
with
chadwick
and
sanders,
this
is
a
stronger
case.
there
is
no
probable
cause
to
search
in
this
case.
there
is
no
exigency.
the
idea
that
the
defendant
in
sanders
could
have
got
to
his
suitcase
was
much
greater
than
in
this
case.
accordingly,
your
honors,
we
would
ask
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
appellate
court
finding
that
the
inventory
question
was
rightly
decided,
and
also
we
think
review
of
the
search
incident
to
arrest
question
is
precluded.
thank
you.
