you
agree
you
must
resort
to
legislative
history
to
win
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
ambiguity
in
the
statute?
do
you
think
it
is
what
meaning
you
give
to
steal--
justice
byron
r.
white
--because
there
was
a
carrying
away
of
money
with
some
kind
of
an
intent
to...
at
least
the
person
knew
he
was
not
entitled
to
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
jerome
at
least
used
words
that
had
some
common
law
meaning
like
larceny--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
things
like
that,
but
steal
or
purloin
does
not
have
that
kind
of
meaning.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
other
statutes
that
would
make
it
a
crime
to
get
money
from
a
bank
other
than
by
this
violent
kind
of
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
any
other
federal
law,
any
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
will
put
it
another
way.
does
this
act
go
as
far
as
any
act
towards
covering
false
pretenses
kinds
of
crime,
or
are
there
some
other
statutes
that
might
reach
false
pretenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
federal.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
does
this
come
as
close
as
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
some
of
the
cases
on
either
side
of
this
issue...
do
some
of
them
relate
to
say
giving
a
bank
false
information
in
an
application
for
a
loan
and
getting
money
from--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
1014
congress
has
protected
the
bank
against
false
statements
in
loan
applications?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
really
has
not
left
to
the
states
in
all
circumstances
the
false
pretenses
crimes,
all
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here
is
just
another
arguably
did
not
leave
the
false
pretenses
kind
of
crime
involved
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
he
have
been
charged
with
under
state
law?
do
you
suppose
forgery?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
how
about--
justice
byron
r.
white
--he
forged
somebody's
name,
did
he
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
purported
to
be
the
payee,
did
he
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
embezzlement
is
a
taking
away?
at
least
there
is
a
taking
away
here,
is
there
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
was
an
embezzlement,
why
would
the
statute
not
cover
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
other
instances
where
an
act
we
have
already
recognized
it
that,
i
think
it
is
in
the
bank
field,
where
the
same
act
violates
two
different
criminal
statutes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
false
application
on
a
loan
application?
a
false
statement
on
a
loan
application,
that
is
covered
in
another
section.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
on
the
books
in
'37?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
has
it
been
limited?
it
has
not
been
limited
by
a
amendment
of
the
statute,
is
it?
there
has
been
a
construction?
by
a
definition
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
that
were
not
the
case,
why
it
would
apply
to
any
bank
and
it
would
not
make
any
difference
how
this
case
came
out.
whatever
the
reach
of
this
statute
it
would
reach
any
bank.
