mr.
roy
w.
allman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
my
position
here
in
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
bank
robbery
statute,
section
2113(b)
does
not
cover
the
crime
of
false
pretenses.
here,
as
the
facts
indicated
in
the
brief,
a
client
managed
to
take
some
money
from
dade
federal
savings
and
loan
by
and
with
their
consent
with
an
artificial
trick.
that
is,
he
altered
a
check
which
was
sort
of
obvious
had
they
looked
at
it
and
took
$10,000
from
this
account
which
he
created
in
his
own
name.
the
check
was
drawn
to
him.
it
was
done
totally
by
mistake
on
behalf
of
the
bank.
basically
what
we
have--
mr.
roy
w.
allman
--no,
dade
federal
savings
and
loan.
it
was
a
check
which
he
somehow
came
into
possession
of,
altered
the
deposit
number
on
the
back,
i.e.,
put
his
account
number
after
scratching
out
somebody
else's
and
put
it
in
an
account
that
he
created
at
dade
federal
savings
and
loan.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
drawn
through
somebody
else
for
deposit
to
some
account
of
the
person
whose
check
it
was.
basically,
he
got
the
bank
involved
through
the
bank's
mistake.
it
is
my
position
in
reading
the
statute
and
it
has
created
an
ambiguity.
it
has
got
the
courts
of
appeal...
i
think
it
is
five
to
four
now...
construing
this
statute
both
narrowly
and
broadly.
the
bank
robbery
statute
which
in
1934
was
specifically
limited
to
bank
robbery
amended
in
1937
to
include
the
terms
1937
interpreted
and
argued
by
the
government
that,
in
fact,
this
covered
only
common
law
larceny.
so
the
position
now...
the
former
fifth
circuit
now
the
eleventh
first
went
along
with
my
arguments
in
my
brief
then
en
banc
reversed
itself
and
took
the
broad
position
that
2113(b)
covered
the
crime
of
false
pretense.
the
reason
all
this
has
come
about
is
the
way
this
congress
drew
the
statute.
the
statute
was
drawn
as
follows:
it
indicated
that
you
take
and
carry
away,
steal,
or
purloin,
words
that
are
not
necessarily
defined
specifically
at
common
law
but
are
in
fact
defined
now
generically.
but
in
1934,
1937
were
contemplated
in
the
common
law
sense.
what
has
happened
is
this.
in
1934
a
broad
bank
robbery
statute
in
dual
form
was
submitted
to
the
house
judiciary
committee.
the
committee
considered
this
bill
and
specifically,
specifically
rejected
the
aspects
of
the
bill
that
covered
crimes
of
false
pretense,
embezzlement
and
other
crimes
by
trick
or
consensual
takings
and
restricted
it
to
the
forceful
robbery
concept.
thus,
the
title
of
the
act,
the
text
of
the
bill
and
the
thrust
of
the
situation
in
1934
with
the
gangster-style
bank
robberies
going
on.
subsequently,
apparently
in
briefly
reading
the
act
the
prosecutors
have
brought
prosecutions
of
people
who
take
money
from
banks
in
various
types
of
ways,
false
checks,
forgeries,
false
pretenses,
trick,
deceipt,
fraud,
et
cetera.
four
districts
have
gone
along
with
this.
four
districts
have
not.
however,
the
supreme
court
itself
in
jerome
in
1943
took
the
position
and
the
government
took
the
position
that
the
bank
robbery
act,
2213(b)
was
a
common
law
situation
defining
the
crimes
it
intended
to
proscribe
as
robbery,
burglary,
and
larceny
even
though
the
act
eventually
uses
the
terms
"steal,
purloin,
take
and
carry
away.
"
which
are
not
specific
to
those
crimes.
in
turley,
the
supreme
court
gave
us
some
indications
how
we
should
interpret
these
nonspecific
common
law
terms.
what
they
have
said
is
this.
you
look
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
in
this
case
specifically
in
le
master
the
ninth
circuit
looked
at
the
legislative
history
in
great
detail
and
quoted
directly
from
it
saying
they
could
not
do
better
than
the
analysis
which
they
put
forth
of
the
legislative
history
which
showed
specifically
the
act
was
originally
intended
to
be
broad.
it
was
tightened
and
limited
to
robbery
in
1934
and
then
extended
to
burglary
and
common
law
larceny
only
in
1937.
for
this
reason
the
factual
situation
that
mr.
bell
put
himself
in
unwittingly
exempted
him
from
prosecution
under
2113(b).
in
the
dissent
in
the
eleventh
circuit
the
judge
said
it
is
not
a
question
that
mr.
bell
has
committed
some
kind
of
a
crime.
however,
the
crime
he
committed
is
not
contemplated
in
2113(b)
because
the
legislative
history
combined
with
the
title
to
the
act
combined
with
the
fact
that
the
act
contemplated
a,
shall
we
say,
active
or
violent
taking
away
from,
robbery,
burglary,
some
kind
of
active,
moving
type
of
crime
as
opposed
to
the
act
of
crime
of
false
pretenses.
that
is
something
stealthily
done.
it
is
our
position
if
you
follow
turley
and
the
appellate
courts
that
look
at
turley
carefully
and
analyze
the
guidelines
in
turley
and
apply
them
to
the
act
in
this
case
including
the
context
of
the
act,
that
is
robbery,
violent
acts,
taking
away,
carrying
away,
that
type
of
thing
with
the
fact
that
they
were
specifically
in
the
bill
in
the
house
investigation
of
what
they
should
do
about
the
robbery
situations
occurring
in
the
'30s
took
and
eliminated
the
crime
of
false
pretenses
from
the
purview
of
this
act.
it
is
my
conclusion
and
i
think
the
only
conclusion
that
is
reasonable
if
you
take
the
act
and
interpret
the
ambiguities
in
it
in
accordance
with
what
has
happened,
legislative--
mr.
roy
w.
allman
--yes,
i
do,
judge,
and
i
think
in
the
ninth
circuit
le
master
analyzed
the
legislative
histories
of
2113(b)
even
though
turley
was
a--
mr.
roy
w.
allman
--steal
and
purloin,
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
there
is
no
question
about
that,
judge.
he
committed
a
crime
probably
a
state
crime
involving
the
generic
term.
he
stole.
he
took
somebody
else's
property.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
larceny--
mr.
roy
w.
allman
--it
is
a
generic
term.
that
is
correct,
and
that
creates
the
ambiguity
in
this
sense.
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
the
law,
if
they
intended
to
cover
that
type
of
crime
they
would
not
have
eliminated
specifically
the
crime
of
false
pretenses
as
they
did
in
the
legislative
debates
that
created
the
robbery
statute.
they
wanted
to
leave
the
states
with
that
type
of
crime
specifically
focusing
the
federal
law
on
the
crime
involving
robbery,
active
carrying
away,
the
violent
gangster-type
crime
that
initiated
this
situation.
that
is
my
analysis
of
that
ambiguity
situation,
judge.
in
turley
where
they
were
interpreting
the
dire
act
of
the
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
motor
vehicles
that
type
of
thing,
stolen
was
construed
consistently
with
the
legislative
history
to
be
a
broad
thing
where
the
federal
government
had
an
interest
in
controlling
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
vehicles.
in
this
case
it
is
the
exact
opposite.
the
congress
specifically
eliminated
the
crime
of
false
pretenses
in
its
debate
before
creating
the
statute.
that
is
analyzed
very
well,
i
think,
in
le
master,
the
ninth
circuit
decision
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
other
four
decisions
in
applying
turley
to
the
word
"stolen"
in
the
context
of
the
statute
along
with
the
legislative
history.
the
only
conclusion
i
think
you
can
come
to
reasonably
if
you
look
at
le
master
and
go
along
with
turley
is
that
2113(b)
was
a
restrictive
statute
and
the
government
used
to
argue
in
1937
that
in
fact
it
was
a
restrictive
statute.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
yes,
there
are,
judge.
i
think
every
state
in
the
union
has
a
generic
term
which
they--
mr.
roy
w.
allman
--yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
recent
case,
williams.
the
williams
case
construing,
i
think
it
was
1025,
indicates
that,
and
this
court
held
recently,
i
think
it
was
1982
that
unless
the
congress
specifically
says
in
so
many
words
that
this
is
the
proscribed
act,
we
will
not
expand
the
congressional
intent
to
cover
a
generic-type
situation.
in
analyzing
the
legislative
history
in
williams,
this
is
exactly
what
they
did.
the
government
was
seeking
to
place
a
broad
concept
on
the
word's
use
in
the
statute
where
congress
in
its
legislative
history
did
not
intend
to
say--
mr.
roy
w.
allman
--there
are
other
statutes
both
state
and
federal.
i
believe--
mr.
roy
w.
allman
--okay.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
i
believe
this
comes
about
as
close
as
any.
there
are
other
statutes
that
cover,
for
instance,
the
card
sharking
statute
which
specifically
contemplated
false
pretenses
by
specific
language
which
i
cite
in
my
brief.
i
can't
recall
the
case
name
at
this
time.
however,
in
that
case
the
congress
specifically
said
card
sharking
and
false
pretenses
is
a
federal
crime
on
the
high
seas...
it
was
gambling
off
the
shore
of
new
jersey
or
something
like
that...
specifically
enumerated
by
congress.
this
is
the
reverse.
in
this
case
congress
specifically
contemplated
a
broad
bank
robbery
statute
in
the
house
bill
and
rejected
it.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
that
is
williams.
that
was
decided
in
1982.
that
is
the
one--
mr.
roy
w.
allman
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
reading
that
as
a
false
statement
report
to
get
money
to
lend.
i
guess
that
is
probably
inducing
a
bank
to
lend
you
money
by
false
statement
or
some
other
misrepresentation.
that
is
the
way
i
read
section
18
u.s.c.
1014.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
well,
in
reality
he
took
advantage
of
the
bank's
mistake.
he
basically
forged
the
check,
eliminated
the
back
deposit
number,
put
his
number
and
name
on
it
and
deposited
it.
the
bank
didn't
look
at
the
check
and
paid
him
the
money.
the
false
statement
i
guess...
he
induced
the
bank
by
trick
or
fraud
to
give
him
somebody
else's
money
is
what
he
did.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
he
committed
a
crime.
the
only
problem
was
the
crime
was
not
2113(b).
mr.
roy
w.
allman
i
am
not
certain
about
that,
but
i
am
certain
that
dade
federal
guaranteed
his
endorsement
and,
therefore,
they
ultimately
would
have
paid
for
their
mistake,
i'm
sure.
it
is
an
interesting
footnote
that
the
money
this
man
got
by
this
means
was
taken
from
him
in
a
burglary
apparently.
that
is
immaterial,
i
guess.
[laughter]
mr.
roy
w.
allman
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
i
would
agree
with
that
100
percent,
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
i
would
have
no
problem
with
that
in
resolving
the
ambiguity
in
saying
stolen
or
purloined
if
the
legislative
history
had
not
specifically
eliminated
the
crime
of
false
pretenses.
in
le
master,
in
jerome
if
you
look
at
the
le
master
case,
the
house
judiciary
committee
had
a
very
broad
bill.
they
accepted
one
provision
and
eliminated
two
others.
specifically
section
2
said
it
should
be
a
crime
for
anybody
to
trick
a
bank
in
any
way
shape
or
form,
false
pretenses
or
whatever
and
accomplish
the
taking
of
money
from
said
bank.
this
was
not
enacted
in
the
statute.
it
was
contemplated
and
eliminated
specifically
in
2113(b).
that
is
why
i
think
it
is
different.
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
result
had
they
left
it
in,
but
they
did
not.
that
is
my
problem
with
2113(b)
in
this
prosecution.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
larceny.
straight
larceny.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
forgery.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
in
reality
forgery
is
given
very
broad
definition
in
florida.
if
you
do
something
that
alters
something
to
your
benefit--
mr.
roy
w.
allman
--yes.
he
removed
for
deposit
only
to
some
account
number.
he
scratched
that
out,
for
deposit
only,
me,
my
account
number.
that
is
exactly
what
he
did.
the
bank
chose
to
ignore
the
fact
that
he
scratched
out
the
prior
limited
endorsement,
and
they
guaranteed
his
endorsement.
that
was
the
bank's
mistake.
but
that
is
not
a
crime
under
2113(b)
and
that
is
the
whole
problem
here.
it
should
be,
but
it
is
not.
the
congress
chose
to
eliminate
that
specifically
in
the
legislative
history,
and
that
is
the
problem.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
you
could
argue
that,
judge,
but
when
congress
has
done
something
specifically
and
not
later
taken
corrective
action
as
they
have
done
in
other
cases--
mr.
roy
w.
allman
--the
bill
which
was
not
enacted
into
law--
mr.
roy
w.
allman
--that
is
correct.
if
you
look
at
the
'37
act,
the
attorney
general
said,
look,
we
have
got
a
robbery
statute
but
if
there
is
nobody
around
and
the
guy
comes
in
and
takes
the
money
off
the
counter
and
walks
out,
we
do
not
have
a
robbery.
we
cannot
prosecute
him
under
our
bank
robbery
act.
therefore,
we
should
change
the
act
as
follows:
make
it
burglary,
you
do
not
have
to
put
anybody
into
fear
to
take
the
money,
and
larceny,
common
law
larceny.
at
that
time
the
government
argued,
yes,
the
definition
is
common
law
larceny--
mr.
roy
w.
allman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
takes
and
carries
away,
steals,
or
purloins.
that
is
an
inaccurate
common
law
larceny
definition
basically.
it
is
a
little
broader
than
that.
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
if
we
are
going
to
separate
the
part...
false
pretenses
gets
us
to
the
fact
that
they
tricked
him.
the
bank
gave
consent
to
take
it,
yes.
with
the
larceny
situation,
and
i
think
as
the
statute
reads
and
as
congress
intended
it
contemplated
an
active,
violent,
robbery,
burglary
concept,
coming
in
and
taking
something,
not
coming
in
talking
to
the
teller,
putting
a
check
in,
going
back,
waiting
the
20-day
period
and
then
withdrawing
the
money
at
their
leisure
taking
a
chance
that
the
bank
would
not
detect
this.
this
is
not
common
law
larceny.
this
is
false
pretenses.
le
master
specifically
addressed
this
issue
and
said
the
statute
does
not
cover
it.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
yes,
sir?
mr.
roy
w.
allman
this
is
the
way
i
feel
and
this
is
what
i
think
congress
was
concerned
with.
they
were
concerned
with,
i
think,
the
violent
aspect,
taking
and
carrying
away,
the
robbery
concept.
this
is
the
federal
bank
robbery
act.
twenty-one
thirteen
(b)
is,
i
think,
a
lessening
of
the
requirement
for
violence
but
requiring
still
the
nonconsensual
taking
away.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
burglary
or
larceny,
but
the
quick,
violent
active
type
of
crime
that
congress
was
addressing
in
this
matter,
if
you
look
at
legislative
history
and
if
you
look
at
the
interpretation
in
turley,
turley
says
how
are
we
going
to
interpret
the
words
"steal
and
purloin"?
purloin
could
mean
by
stealth,
but
it
is
still
the
same
concept.
all
the
tellers
go
to
the
coffee
machine.
he
comes
in
sees
the
money
on
the
table
picks
it
up
and
walks
out.
that
is
a
larceny.
like
you
say,
there
is
no
consent
from
the
bank.
in
this
case
the
bank
helped
him
commit
this
crime
by
a
mistake.
he
tricked
the
bank
as
just
as
though
he
tricked
the
people
who
had
the
money.
that
is
why
congress
in
limiting
itself
to
the
violent
type
of
crime
specifically
said,
we
do
not
want
to
cover
the
crime
of
false
pretenses
by
eliminating
section
2
in
the
1934
bill
and
again
in
1937
not
specifically
enacting
it.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
i
mean
active.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
nonconsensual,
active
taking
away,
yes,
sir.
that
is
my
problem
with
this
statute
applying
to
this
case.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
it
is
both
a
removal.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
it
is
a
crime.
the
difference
is
this--
mr.
roy
w.
allman
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
roy
w.
allman
yes.
he
carries
it
away.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
the
difference
is
in
this
case
congress
considered
the
option
of
covering
consensual
trickery
or
crimes
by
the
bank
coming
in
and
being
suckered
into
a
deal.
they
considered
that.
they
specifically
eliminated
it
in
1934.
if
they
had
intended
and
if
it
had
been
a
problem
as
the
burglary
and
larceny
aspects,
the
original
statute
was
inadequate
to
cover
the
immediate
taking
and
nonconsensual
carrying
away
type
thing,
so
in
'37
they
amended
it.
they
changed
it.
but
they
did
not
go
back
to
section
2
which
they
eliminated
in
1934
and
say
this
shall
include
either
by
implication
and
interpretation
the
trick,
false
pretense.
false
pretense
was
not
larceny
ever
under
definition
in
common
law.
false
pretense
was
a
separate
crime
primarily
because
they
got
possession
and
title.
the
larceny
thing
they
got
possession
with
the
consent.
in
this
case
the
bank
intended
him
to
have
the
money.
they
thought
it
was
his
money.
they
had
made
a
mistake.
he
had
involved
the
bank
in
a
crime
but
not
the
crime
under
2113(b)
because
there
was
no
nonconsensual
taking
away.
there
was
a
consensual
tricking
of
the
bank
not
covered
by
this
statute.
the
legislative
history
is
specific
on
that.
they
could
have
put
it
in.
they
did
not.
in
williams
this
court
absent
support
in
legislative
history
for
the
design
of
a
statute
to
apply
to
the
specific
conduct,
this
court,
the
supreme
court
holds
it
is
not
proscribed.
that
is
not
the
conduct
approached
in
this
statute.
that
was
the
conclusion
in
williams
in
18
u.s.c.
1014.
we
have
an
analogous
situation.
just
recently
the
supreme
court
again
said
consistent
with
the
approach
of
lenity
the
construction
of
a
criminal
statute
shall
be
specific.
they
shall
not
be
presumed
to
take
over
the
state's
role
in
prosecuting
crimes.
the
federal
bank
robbery
statute
approaches
and
addresses
itself
specifically
according
to
legislative
history
the
nonconsensual,
violent
or
active
taking
away
from
a
bank
not
false
pretense
which
was
contemplated
and
rejected.
this
is
my
whole
problem
with
2113(b)
in
this
case.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
no,
sir.
the
statute
is
not
wrong
in
the
state
case--
mr.
roy
w.
allman
--and
i
think
ultimately
that
is
what
the
courts
are
doing.
they
are
making
sure
that
somebody
who
does
something
that
is
wrong
is
punished.
i
think
what
is
happening
is
they
are
stretching
the
statutes
to
far
when
the
congressional
intent
was
specific
not
to
stretch
it
to
this
crime.
i
think
what
really
happened
and
basically
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
prosecutor
charged
him
with
the
wrong
statute.
he
could
have
turned
it
over
the
the
state.
the
man
would
have
been
punished.
he
made
a
mistake.
in
the
dissent
they
admit
he
committed
a
crime.
he
did
something
wrong.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
problem
is
is
it
going
to
be
punished
or
are
we
going
to
let
him
go
because
he
was
charged
with
the
wrong
statute.
unfortunately,
under
the
law
a
few
guilty
men
must
escape
so
that
the
law
maintains
its
integrity.
i
have
reserved
some
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
might.
mr.
roy
w.
allman
may
it
please
the
court.
everything
he
said
was
true.
the
government
is
arguing
what
the
statute
should
say
and
maybe
what
the
law
should
be,
but
i
am
arguing
what
the
law
is
and
what
congress
intended
the
law
to
be
specifically
in
the
development
of
this
law.
this
law
has
been
specifically
expanded
and
amended
and
nowhere
in
all
this
time
since
1934
has
congress
taken
upon
itself
to
say
it
covers
the
crime
of
false
pretenses.
it
has
added
larceny
and
burglary.
the
government
used
to
argue
in
jerome
in
1943
it
applied
to
common
law
larceny
specifically.
there
is
no
question
about
that
but
the
definitions
are
not
important.
what
we
have
to
decide
here
is
the
ambiguity
of
steal
and
purloin.
is
it
expansive
to
the
point
where
it
covers
crime
by
false
pretenses
and
the
answer
is
no.
sumner
specifically
addressed
that
issue
saying
he
wanted
to
confine
the
extension
of
federal
power
to
those
situations
where
the
need
to
supplement
state
and
local
law
enforcing
agencies
had
become
imperative.
it
was
an
emergency-type
statute
to
eliminate
bank
robberies.
it
is
the
bank
robbery
statute,
not
the
thing
that
is
covered
by
state
law
and
the
statute
has
not
run
on
a
state
law
in
this
case
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
a
man
did
commit
a
crime
by
false
pretenses.
that
is
my
whole
point
in
this
case.
2113(b)
is
not
an
expansive
statute.
it
is
a
narrowly
defined
and
specifically
drawn
federal
statute
that
does
not
approach
and
control
for
that
crime.
thank
you.
