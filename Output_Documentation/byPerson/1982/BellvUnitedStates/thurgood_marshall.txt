am
i
correct
that
if
you
win
your
man
goes
free
and
that
the
statute
is
wrong
in
the
state
case?
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
too
sure
that
the
statute
does
not
limit
it
to
those.
it
says
any
bank.
the
statute
says
any
bank,
those
insured
or
not
would
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
all
banks
insured?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
statute
says
all
banks.
does
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
any
bank,
credit
union,
or
any
savings
and
loan
association,
so
it
applies
to
all
banks.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
statute
we
are
operating
under
says
all
banks.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
says
all
banks.
that
is
the
one
we
are
operating
under?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
join
justice
stevens.
i
do
not
see
what
the
federal
government's
interest
is
in
any
bank.
an
uninsured
bank,
what
interest
would
the
federal
government
have?
in
stealing
money
from
an
unfederally
uninsured
bank?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
get
back
to
the
other
question
that
you
made.
what
is
there
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
rules
of
the
department
that
delineate
a
line
between
state
and
federal
crime
on
a
particular
alleged
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
state
law
would
not
cover
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mine
is
what
line
says
that
this
is
a
state
crime
and
this
is
a
federal
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
it
was
two
crimes.
this
is
two
crimes,
a
federal
crime
and
a
state
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
procedure
in
the
department
of
justice
that
says
who
should
prosecute
an
instance
of
double
crime
when
it
is
a
crime
against
two
sovereigns?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
why
this
was
brought
in
the
federal
rather
than
the
state
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir,
in
this
one.
there
is
nothing
in
this
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there
is
no
burden
on
the
federal
department?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
so.
