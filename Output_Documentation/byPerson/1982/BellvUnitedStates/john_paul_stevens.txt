is
there
not
an
aspect
of
the
legislative
history
that
you
have
not
addressed
at
least
yet?
in
the
'34
bill
they
broke
it
into
two
parts,
consensual
takings
and
nonconsensual
takings
and
it
was
with
the
consent
of
the
bank
that
the
artifice
and
trick
line
which
appeared.
but
in
the
'37
bill
there
is
no
division
between
consensual
and
nonconsensual
from
which
one
might
infer,
i
am
not
sure
this
is
right,
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
cover
both
categories
and
once
it
covers
both
categories
you
do
not
need
the
artifice
language
because
takes
and
carries
away
is
enough
to
take
care
of
it.
anyway,
you
see
what
i
mean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
take
out
the
words
"without
the
consent
of
the
bank.
"
which
was
also
in
the
'34
bill.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
that
bill
said
without
the
consent
of
the
bank
was
one
of
the
two
alternatives,
but
that
language
is
not
in
the
'37
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
wanted
just
to
cover
that
situation,
should
they
not
have
said
takes
and
carries
away
without
the
consent
of
the
bank
because
in
that
situation
there
would
have
been
no
consent--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
one
that
they
are
talking
about
specifically.
somebody
came
in
and
found
the
money
on
the
counter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
suggesting
the
statute
should
be
read
as
if
it
included
the
words
"without
the
consent
of
the
bank?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
same
true
that
that
would
have
been
a
violation
of
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
a
violation
of
state
law,
i
assume?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
in
a
broader
sense,
what
is
the
reason
why
these
cases
ought
to
be
in
the
federal
court
rather
than
the
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
it
is
a
federal
insurance
at
a
bank,
but
nevertheless
it
is
a
state
crime
as
well.
just
in
terms
of
allocating
law
enforcement
resources,
why
would
this
not
be
a
good
category
to
leave
to
the
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
true
that
it
was
passed
in
response
to
a
specific
problem.
john
dillinger
and
some
of
his
friends
were
running
around
the
country
crossing
state
lines
holding
up
banks
all
over
the
place.
was
that
not
what
caused
this
statute
to
be
enacted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
and
then
they
picked
it
up
to
take
care
of
the
fellow
who
walks
in
and
finds
the
money
on
the
counter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
didn't
you
read
the
statute
correctly?
if
it
did
not
say
that
you
would
make
precisely
the
same
argument
to
the
contrary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
right
on
that
point?
the
footnote
your
brief
quotes,
i
guess
it
is
a
note
which
i
have
not
read
but
points
out
that
chairman
sumners
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
in
1934
sought
to
limit
the
expansion
of
federal
power
just
to
those
situations
where
there
was
not
really
a
strong
showing
of
need.
i
am
curious
to
know
and
perhaps
i
should
not
take
your
time,
but
was
he
still
chairman
of
the
committee
in
1937?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
why
it
would
seem
to
me...
i
wonder
if
he
thought
it
was
as
expansive
as
the
government's
argument
would
make.
is
that
consistent
with
the
views
he
seemed
to
be
espousing
in
'34?
do
you
think
maybe
he
changed
his
mind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
more
broadly
than
'34?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
example
that
was
given,
and
am
i
correct,
and
it
is
the
only
example
that
was
given
was
the
larceny
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
