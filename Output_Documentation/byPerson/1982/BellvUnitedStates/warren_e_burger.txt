why
is
this
less
a
removal
than
taking
it

3:00

mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
one
explanation
on
the
policy
issue
is
that
that
is
the
way
congress
decided
it
should
be.
congress
enacted
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
my
point
is
only
with
respect
to
the
policy
question
that
was
suggested
that
why
does
the
federal
government
get
into
it.
the
answer
is
because
congress
says.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
