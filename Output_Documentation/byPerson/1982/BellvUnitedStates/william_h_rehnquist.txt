h.
rehnquist
mr.
allman,
daytona
wasn't
the
drawee
of
the
check
either,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
check
wasn't
drawn
on
dade
federal
savings
and
loan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
the
liabilities
been
settled
as
between
the
dade
federal
savings
and
whatever
bank
the
check
was
drawn
upon
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
allman--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--wasn't
common
law
an
element
of
i
think
they
call
it
aspertation
in
larceny.
was
that
not
just
taking
and
carrying
away
requiring
a
removal
right
them
so
to
speak?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
it
does
not
have
to
be
robbery.
it
could
be
burglary.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
a
violent
i
take
it--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--burglary
could
certainly
obtain
at
3:00
in
the
morning
and
no
guards
around.
there
would
be
no
violence
but
there
would
be
an
immediate
removal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
giuliani,
did
he
take
cash?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
just
burglaries
but
robberies.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
giuliani,
what
if
mr.
bell
instead
of
being
an
outsider
here
had
been
a
teller
in
the
dade
federal
savings
and
loan
association
and
had
simply
embezzled
$10,000?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
it
was
covered
also
by
this
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
mean
you
think
it
might
be
but
you
are
not
sure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
taking
away
requirement
is
really
almost
done
away
with
because
in
the
facts
of
this
case
you
have
bell
actually
taking
$10,000
that
did
not
belong
to
him,
dollar
bills,
so
to
speak,
or
tens
or
hundreds,
but
in
the
embezzlement
thing
it
is
just
basically
a
credit
or
a
ledger
transaction.
you
say
that
is
covered,
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
am
not
trying
to
strike
a
bargain.
i
am
just
trying
to
find
out
how
high
you
think
the
statute
should
be
interpreted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
embezzlement?
