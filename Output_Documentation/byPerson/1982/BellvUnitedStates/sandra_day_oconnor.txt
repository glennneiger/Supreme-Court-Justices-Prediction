--well,
couldn't
this
defendant
perhaps
have
been
charged
under
that
section
1014?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
he
certainly
got
money
by
means
of
false
statements
here.

mr.
giuliani,
speaking
of
the
jerome
case,
in
jerome
the
court
held
the
burglary
prohibition
of
section
2113(a)
did
not
cover
this
act
and
the
underlying
act
in
jerome
was,
i
think,
uttering
a
forged
check.
under
your
theory,
could
the
government
have
brought
that
action
under
subsection
(b)
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
contrary
to
your
position.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the
act
had
been
completed
in
the
jerome
situation,
could
the
government
have
prosecuted
under
subsection
(b)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
the
government
in
the
case
that
we
had
last
term
in
williams
have
prosecuted
for
the
check
kiting
scheme
under
this
subsection?
