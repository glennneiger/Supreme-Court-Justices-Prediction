mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
obtained
possession
of
a
$10,000
check
that
did
not
belong
to
him
to
be
deposited
into
a
savings
account
at
the
dade
county
savings
and
loan
association.
petitioner
opened
an
account
at
the
dade
county
bank
using
a
false
address,
birthdate
and
social
security
number.
he
then
deposited
the
stolen
check
into
this
new
account
at
another
branch
of
the
dade
bank
using
a
second
false
address
and
having
altered
the
account
number
on
the
check
to
state
his
own
new
account
number.
after
a
20-day
holding
period,
petitioner
withdrew
$10,000
plus
interest
from
this
account.
in
plain
every
day
english,
petitioner
stole
$10,000
plus
interest
that
at
the
time
belonged
to
the
dade
county
bank,
a
bank
insured
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
the
bank
theft
statute,
18,
u.s.c.
section
2113(b)
prohibits
anyone
from
taking
and
carrying
away
with
intent
to
steal
or
purloin
money
belonging
to
a
bank
insured
by
the
fdic.
in
plain--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
he
did.
in
plain
english
that
is
precisely
what
petitioner
did.
he
stole
$10,000.
in
order
to
avoid
the
express
language
of
this
prohibition,
petitioner
urges
that
the
words
do
not
mean
what
they
say
but
instead
should
be
read
to
mean
that
congress
in
1937
meant
to
prohibit
solely
larceny
at
common
law.
that
is
trespassory
taking
or
taking
without
consent.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
ten
fourteen
would
not
because
this
would
under
your
own
decision
in
1014
this
would
not
have
amounted
to
an
extension
of
credit.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
yes,
your
honor.
crucial
to
the
crime
of
larceny
at
common
law
was
a
trespass
really
a
physical
invasion
because
primitive
criminal
law
was
concerned
only
with
protection
against
force
or
violence.
a
trespass
was
necessary
for
any
crime
to
be
felonious.
as
the
criminal
law
developed,
however,
and
expanded
to
protect
other
interests
including
property
rather
than
acknowledging
the
changing
nature
of
the
law,
the
courts
in
england
engaged
in
fiction
to
avoid
the
reality
of
reversing
prior
precedents.
so
crimes
such
as
larceny
by
trick
an
unilateral
mistake
developed
so
that
it
was
larceny
to
trick
someone
out
of
possession
of
that
money,
but
it
would
not
constitute
larceny
if
the
owner
of
the
money
had
also
turned
over
title.
if
petitioner's
argument
is
accepted
and
these
ancient
distinctions
are
revived,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
section
2113(b)
if
a
person
cashing
a
check
for
$100
mistakenly
received
$1,000
from
the
teller,
realized
that
mistake
and
decided
to
keep
it
and
walked
out
of
the
bank
because
that
at
common
law
would
have
amounted
to
larceny
by
trick
in
the
sense
that
according
to
the
fiction
only
possession
had
been
turned
over,
not
title.
if,
however,
that
same--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
i
assume
it
would
be.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
well,
your
honor,
the
banks--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--well,
first
of
all
there
is
potential
federal
lability
in
the
sense
of
all
of
these
banks
are
insured
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--and
it
is
our
view
that
this
is
precisely--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--no,
your
honor,
it
would
have
to
be
either
a--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--i
do
not
believe
all
banks
are
insured,
your
honor,
it
would
have
to
be--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--well,
it
should
be--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--now
it
does.
at
the
time
that
this
amendment
was
passed
in
1937
it
was
passed
specifically
to
apply
to
banks
that
were
insured
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
it
has
been
expanded
since
then.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
that
is
correct.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
first
of
all,
your
honor,
this
particular
bank
was
not
an
uninsured
bank.
this
bank
was
insured
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
the
statute
that
we
are
construing
here
was
passed
in
order
to
protect
the
assets
of
federally
insured
banks
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
argue
for
an
interpretation
that
would
include
all
forms
of
theft.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
no,
your
honor,
that
is
what
caused
the
1934
act
to
pass.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
but
i
think
there
is
a
very
big
difference
between
the
1934
act
and
the
1937
act.
the
1934
act
when
it
originally
was
proposed
by
the
attorney
general
would
have
covered
all
forms
of
taking.
it
would
have
covered
robbery,
burglary,
and
larceny
both
with
and
without
consent.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
but,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
gives
effect
to
what
the
1937
congress
did.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
that
is
precisely
correct.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
well,
our
argument
is
simply
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
if
you
put
aside
distinctions
that
are
200
and
300
years
old
and
have
been
criticized
for
200
or
300
years
as
just
introducing
technicalities
into
the
law
that
have
no
equity.
if
you
read
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
it
certainly
covers
the
conduct
of
this
petitioner
taking
and
carrying
away
$10,000.
then
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
1937
act
and
what
petitioner
has
done
is
to
confuse
the
legislative
history
of
the
1934
act
with
the
legislative
history
of
the
1937
act.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
1934
act
was
limited
to
bank
robberies.
the
house
so
limited
it.
their
concern
was
the
bonnie
and
clyde
gangster
bank
robbers
who
moved
around
state
to
state.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
only
robberies
in
1934.
in
1935,
however,
a
significant
fact
occurred.
congress
expanded
the
coverage
of
the
bank
robbery
statute
to
cover
not
only
federal
reserve
banks
and
banks
chartered
by
the
federal
government,
but
in
1935
congress
expanded
it
to
cover
all
banks
insured
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation,
a
much
larger
and
greater
area
now
of
potential
federal
liability.
so
that
in
1937
when
the
attorney
general
went
back
to
congress,
he
asked
the
congress
to
expand
the
coverage
of
the
1934
act
to
include
burglary
and
larceny
and
he
used
new
words
to
define
larceny,
not
the
old
words
that
we
used
in
'34
but
new
words.
the
words
that
he
used
were
"taking
and
carrying
away
with
intent
to
steal
or
purloin.
"
so
that
the
purpose
of
the
'37
congress
cannot
be
the
same
as
the
limited
purpose
of
the
'34
congress.
the
purpose
of
the
'37
congress
goes
beyond
merely
being
concerned
about
taking
by
force
and
violence.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
that
would
be
covered
by
a
separate
statute
that
had
a
federal
embezzlement
statute
that
applies
to
agents
and
employees
of
the
bank.
that,
in
fact,
had
already
been
a
violation
of
federal
criminal
law,
i
believe,
at
the
time
these
statutes
were
passed.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
it
could
be
covered
by
this
statute
as
well.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
no,
i
believe
that
the
purpose
of
the
congress
in
1937
was
to
broadly
prohibit
theft
from
a
federal
bank.
that
term
was
defined
then
as
a
generic
term.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
no.
it
does
not
have
to
be
covered,
your
honor.
you
do
not
have
to
go
that
far
because
at
the
time
that
this
statute
was
passed
embezzlement
was
already
a
crime.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
to
reach
theft
offenses,
larceny,
larceny
by
trick,
and
taking
by
false
pretenses.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
it
does
not
have
to
be
read
and
should
not
be
read
to
reach
embezzlement.
embezzlement
is
already
covered
by
another
federal
statute.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
yes,
your
honor,
there
clearly
is.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
well--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--you
could
interpret...
the
statutes
could
cover
the
same
ground.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
that
is
covered
in
1014.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
i
do
not
know
if
it
was
or
not,
if
it
was
on
the
books
in
'37
or
not,
your
honor.
the
embezzlement
statute
was
a
crime
prior
to
1934.
i
do
not
know
about
section
1014.
to
assume
that
congress
in
1937
had
reintroduced
these
distinctions
would
mean
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
this
statute
if
someone
mistakenly
received
$1,000
as
i
said
before
and
decided
to
keep
it.
but
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
this
statute
if
he
stole
checks,
forged
those
checks,
presented
those
checks
to
a
bank
and
over
a
period
of
time
depleted
the
bank
of
unlimited
amounts
of
money
because
at
common
law
one
would
constitute
larceny
by
trick
because
there
had
only
been
a
cheating
of
possession
and
the
other
would
constitute
taking
by
false
pretenses.
petitioner
and
the
few
circuits
supporting
his
view
in
our
view
confused
the
purpose
of
the
1934
congress
with
the
purpose
of
the
1937
congress
and
interpret
those
purposes
as
being
exactly
the
same.
the
1934
bill
as
presented
by
the
attorney
general
and
passed
by
the
senate
would
originally
have
prohibited
robbery,
burglary,
and
larceny
defined
actually
as
both
taking
by
false
pretenses
and
larceny
at
common
law.
the
house
judiciary
committee
struck
the
burglary
and
the
larceny
provision
not
as
petitioner
would
have
it
because
of
some
concern
over
the
reach
of
common
law
larceny.
there
was
no
discussion
of
common
law.
there
was
no
discussion
of
common
law
distinctions.
the
word
never
even
came
up
in
the
legislative
history.
that
congress,
the
1934
congress
was
concerned
with
limiting
the
crime
to
reach
the
situation
of
interstate
gangster
bank
robbers
and
wanted
to
limit
the
crime
just
to
robbery
and
not
to
embrace
burglary
or
any
form
of
larceny.
the
1937
congress
when
it
took
up
this
subject
again
clearly
had
a
different
purpose
than
the
1934
congress.
the
1937
bill
was
intended
to
broaden
coverage
beyond
robbery,
beyond
just
merely
taking
by
force
and
violence
to
cover
burglary
and
larceny.
concededly
under
everyone's
interpretation
of
this
statute,
it
would
cover
crimes
such
as
taking
money
mistakenly
given
by
the
bank
or
larceny
by
trick,
scarcely
crimes
that
are
committed
by
the
bonnie
and
clyde
interstate
bank
robbers.
once
congress
removed
the
force
and
violence
limitation
and
expanded
the
statute
to
reach
nonviolent
theft
as
well
as
fraudulent
theft,
it
cannot
be
logical
to
ascribe
to
the
1937
congress
the
same
intent
as
the
1934
congress.
rather
the
more
logical
and
sensible
conclusion
is
that
in
expanding
the
statute
the
intent
of
the
1937
congress
was
to
give
broad
protection
to
banks
whose
assets
were
insured
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
now
the
choice
of
words
that
congress
used,
i
believe,
is
very
important.
the
petitioner
relies
very
heavily
on
the
fact
that
congress
selected
the
words
"take
and
carry
away"
and
the
title
larceny
as
if
those
two
formulations
are
code
words
for
all
of
the
ancient
distinctions
of
common
law
larceny.
by
1937,
however,
the
words
"take
and
carry
away"
as
well
as
the
term
"larceny"
no
longer
were
limited
solely
to
describing
common
law
larceny.
in
fact,
in
the
1934
bill
which
passed
the
senate
it
used
the
words
"take
and
carry
away"
to
go
on
and
define
takings
without
consent
which
would
have
been
common
law
larceny
and
then
taking
and
carrying
away
with
consent
which
at
ancient
common
law
would
have
been
a
false
pretenses.
as
this
court
has
noted
in
the
turley
decision,
by
1919
the
law
of
many
states
had
developed
to
include
not
only
common
law
larceny
but
larceny
by
trick
and
false
pretenses
in
their
prohibition
of
generic
larceny
and
theft
offenses.
this
court,
in
fact,
in
the
jerome
case
twice
used
the
label
larceny
for
a
description
of
crimes
including
false
pretenses
and
pointed
out
that
congress
did
so
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
1934
act.
thus,
by
1937
to
conclude
mechanically
and
dogmatically
that
larceny
means
solely
common
law
larceny
and
that
takes
and
carries
away
means
the
same
thing
that
it
meant
in
the
18th
century
is
to
ignore
the
contemporary
use
of
those
words
both
common
use
and
use
as
words
of
art.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
no,
your
honor,
because
actually
it
was
an
incomplete
crime.
the
crime
was
never
completed
in
jerome
in
the
sense
of
a
taking
and
carrying
away.
the
jerome
case
does
contain
dicta--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--that
is
contrary
to
the
position
that
the
government
is
now
arguing.
at
the
same
time
the
prince
case
contains
dicta
that
supports
precisely
what
the
government
is
arguing.
the
jerome
case
really
involves
in
our
view
a
very
different
issue.
it
involved
a
question
of
whether
in
determining
whether
congress
meant
to
cover
in
the
burglary
section
a
situation
where
a
person
enters
a
bank
with
intent
to
commit
a
felony.
did
congress
mean
by
felony,
felony
under
the
laws
of
all
the
states
in
which
case
what
it
would
have
read
into
the
federal
statute
all
the
differing
interpretations
and
definitions
of
felony,
high
misdemeanors
and
misdemeanors
that
vary
in
the
48
states
or
not.
it
came
to
the
conclusion
actually
which
is
supportive
of
our
position
that
you
should
not
read
felony
to
mean
what
felony
meant
at
common
law
and
that
you
should
give
it
an
interpretation
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
1937
amendment
which
is
precisely
the--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--yes,
i
believe
so.
it
would
actually
be
a
taking
of
the
money.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
if
the
scheme
had
actually
been
completed
in
the
sense
that
check
kiting
you
have
the
ambiguity
as
to
whether
or
not
the
person
intends
to
make
good
on
the
check
in
the
period
of
time
between
the
time
that
they
write
the
check
and
the
time
that
the
check
is
actually
finally
negotiated.
if,
in
fact,
the
person
goes
through
with
the
check
kiting
scheme
and
takes
away
the
money
then
you
really
move
out
of
the
strict
definition
of
check
kiting
and
you
have
an
actual
theft
of
the
money.
in
looking
at
the
language
that
was
struck
by
the
1934
act,
the
petitioner
ignores
several
crucial
points,
and
i
think
makes
more
of
that
than
the
legislative
history
can
sustain.
the
1934
congress
as
i
said
before
was
concerned
with
a
situation
of
robberies
and
limited
the
language
to
robberies.
it
was
not
in
any
way,
didn't
evince
any
concern
at
all
with
the
coverage
of
larceny
as
either
being
common
law
larceny
or
false
pretenses
so
there
was
not
a
specific
striking
of
the
language
because
congress
was
concerned
with
any
of
these
distinctions
as
between
common
law
larceny
and
false
pretenses.
in
1937
the
new
language
that
was
presented
was
significantly
different.
it
deleted
the
words
mr.
justice
stevens
noted
before
it
also
deleted
the
words
"without
consent"
which
would
have
clearly
defined
solely
common
law
larceny.
so
the
words
that
it
used
"with
intent
to
steal
or
purloin.
"
in
our
view
created
or
evinced
a
concern
with
a
broad
interpretation
or
at
least
as
broad
as
the
matter
that
they
were
concerned
about,
the
assets
of
federally
insured
banks.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
well,
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
the
line
would
be
with
this
particular
bank
a
bank
whose
actual
funds
were
insured
by
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
so
that
i--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--no,
state
law
does
cover
it.
this
is
one
of--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--in
this
particular
case
it
would
be
the
federal
insurance
in
federally
insured
banks,
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
of
the
constitution.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
there
is
a
formal
procedure
that
exists
if
a
person
is
prosecuted
in
one
place
and
then
there
is
the
possibility
of
prosecuting
him
again
because
of
the
possible
double
jeopardy
concerns
involved
in
that.
but
there
is
no
formal
process
that
takes
place
in
making
that
decision
in
advance.
most
united
states
attorneys
have
policies
that
they
work
out
with
district
attorneys
as
to
what
cases
they
will
take
and
what
cases
would
be
turned
over
to
the
department--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--in
most--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--no,
your
honor.
in
most
urban
areas
the
local
prosecutor
is
anxious
for
the
federal
government
to
take
as
many
of
these
cases
as
the
federal
government
can
take
because
of
the
tremendous
burden
on
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
yes,
there
is,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--there
is
a
sharing.
there
is
a
kind
of
attempt
to
share
the
responsibility
and
to
share
the
burden.
this
would
be
one
that
would
easily
fall
within
a
matter
of
federal
interest.
the
amount
of
money
was
$10,000.
it
was
not
de
minimis.
in
some
of
the
drug
cases
there
are
guidelines
that
are
worked
out
so
that
it
has
to
be
either
a
conspiracy
case
or
a
case
involving
a
certain
amount
of
drugs
for
it
to
involve
the
federal
government
and
in
some
of
the
embezzlement
cases
u.s.
attorneys
have
dollar
figures
that
they
use
to
try
to
delineate
the
difference
between
whether
the
federal
government
will
take
the
case
or
the
state
government.
but
by
any
standard
that
i
know
of
a
theft
of
$10,000
would
certainly
be
enough
for
a
united
states
attorney
to
prosecute
it
anywhere.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
i
do
not...
the
statute
was
expanded
in
1950,
your
honor,
to
cover
additional
institutions,
and
it
is
not
limited
just
to
institutions
insured
by
the
fdic.
there
are
a
certain
number
of
banks
that
are
not
covered.
i
am
not
exactly
certain
what
the
additional
criteria
would
have
to
be.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
that
is
correct.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
i
think
that
is
further
defined,
your
honor,
to
include
only
banks
that
are
federal
reserve
banks,
federally
charted
banks
or
banks
that
are
insured
by
the
federal
government
in
some
way.
there
are
very
few
banks
left
that--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--i
think
it
has
been,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
yes,
further
on
in
the
statute,
your
honor,
2113(f)
as
used
in
this
section
the
term
bank
means
any
member
bank,
federal
reserve
system
and
any
bank,
banking
association,
trust
company,
savings
bank
or
other
banking
institution
organized
or
operating
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
any
bank
the
deposits
of
which
are
insured
by
the
fdic.
so
it
would
not
be...
there
are
very
few
banks
left
in
that
category.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
that
is
correct.
your
honors,
there
are
four
principle
reasons
why
we
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit.
first
of
all
the
plain
language
of
this
statute
clearly
reaches
this
conduct.
any
ordinary
person
reading
this
statute
would
assume
that
this
person's
misconduct
was
covered
by
it,
and
there
is
no
issue
here
of
fair
notice
or
in
some
way
the
petitioner's
being
treated
unfairly
because
he
might
have
misunderstood
what
the
statute
meant.
secondly,
the
legislative
purpose
evinced
by
the
1937
congress
clearly
covers
all
forms
of
taking
from
a
federally
insured
bank.
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here
and
that
interpretation,
the
government's
interpretation
is
in
line
with
that
purpose.
third--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--i
believe
he
was.
i
will
check
that
but
i
believe
he
introduced
the
'37
legislation
as
well.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
well,
i
actually
do
not
think
you
have
to
say
that
in
'37
you
need
an
expansive
interpretation
of
the
language
of
either
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history,
just
a
common
sense
interpretation
of
it.
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language
clearly
covers
the
misconduct
and
the
'37
congress
was
clearly
intending
to
protect
banks,
federally
insured
banks,
broadly
against
theft.
so
i
don't
think--
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
--that
is
right.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
it
was
an
example
that
would
have
constituted
if
you
use
the
common
law
distinctions
of
common
law
larceny.
however,
your
honor,
chairman
sumners
never
displayed
any
interest
at
all
or
any
concern
about
whether
larceny
was
defined
as
common
law
larceny
or
taking
by
false
pretenses.
he
was
concerned
about
in
'34
limiting
it
just
to
robbery.
mr.
rudolph
w.
giuliani
but
in
'34
or
'37
there
is
absolutely
no
concern
at
all
evidenced
as
to
whether
it
should
be
common
law
larceny
or
larceny
by
false
pretenses.
in
summation,
the
views
have
now
been...
this
question
has
been
passed
on
by
just
about
every
circuit.
i
believe
nine
circuits
have
either
held
or
expressed
their
viewpoint
on
this,
and
the
split
for
whatever
it
is
worth
is
six
to
three
for
the
government's
view.
but
also
the
most
recent
decision
and
i
believe
the
best
considered
decision
is
the
hinton
case
which
was
decided
after
our
brief
in
the
second
circuit
and
the
simmons
case
lay
out
the
legislative
history
very
clearly.
finally,
to
reintroduce
these
distinctions
would
just
create
unnecessary,
needless
distinctions
that
have
no
purpose
any
longer.
it
would
become
difficult
to
charge
under
this
statute
in
the
sense
of
bringing
an
indictment.
it
would
be
difficult
to
charge
a
jury
as
to
the
distinction
between
possession
and
title.
it
would
also
raise
unnecessary
issues
on
appeal
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
underlying
equities
of
why
theft
or
why
protection
of
federally
insured
banks
should
be
a
federal
crime.
for
all
those
reasons
and
for
the
others
that
we
mentioned
in
our
brief,
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm.
thank
you
very
much.
