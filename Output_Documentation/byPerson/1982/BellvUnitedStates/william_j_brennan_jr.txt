if
this
savings
and
loan
association
had
not
been
federally
insured,
could
there
have
been
a
prosecution
under
this
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
all
banks
but
some
savings
and
loans
institutions,
i
think,
are
purely
state
institutions--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--without
any
federal
insurance.
i
just
wondered
on
the
face
of
the
statute
any
bank
would
seem
to
mean
that
you
could
answer
my
question
yes,
but
i
wondered--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--any
bank
in
this
statute
has
been
so
limited?
