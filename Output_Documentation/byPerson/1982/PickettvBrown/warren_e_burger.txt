will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in

mr.

you
may
proceed.

ms.
short.
chief

e.
burger
in
these
cases,
about
15
or
16
years
later,
is
there
a
dispute
over
paternity
or
merely
a
dispute
in
most
of
them
over
whether
the
person
should
or
can
pay?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
know,
has
an
examination
been
made
of
these
records
to
find
out
in
how
many
of
those
of
cases
had
run
a
long
time...
ten,
12,
14
years,
the
real
dispute
is
merely
over
the
support
and
the
ability
to
pay
or
whether
there
is
a
dispute
over
the
responsibility.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
horne?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
an
economic
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
fading
memories
in
an
appellate
proceedings
are
not
very
important.
it's
at
the
trial
level.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
it
takes
eight
years
to
get
on
to
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
the
equal
protection
problem
be
equally
solved
here
by
holding
the
tennessee
statute
on
18
years
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
