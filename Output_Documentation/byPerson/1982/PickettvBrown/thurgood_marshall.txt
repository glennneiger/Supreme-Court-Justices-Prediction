mr.
horne,
maybe
i
missed
it,
but
what
statute
of
limitations
would
you
be
satisfied
with?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
mother.
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
what
basis?
justice
thurgood
marshall
she
reaches
a
certain
age?
suppose
she's
55.
you
don't
think
that's
mature?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
the
18
years
was
because
the
child
was
not
mature.
was
that
the
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
you
give
a
child
two
years
plus
18
because
an
infant
is
not
mature
enough
to
maintain
a
lawsuit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
true
of
a
45-year-old
mother?
justice
thurgood
marshall
she's
not
mature?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
she's
not
mature?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
that
decision.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
this
case.
i'm
not
talking
about
any
case
about
somebody
dragging
somebody
in
courts,
or
any
of
your
2,500
cases.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
this
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
does
this
woman
here,
this
mother,
have
18
years
to
make
up
her
mind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
plus
two.
she
has
20
years
to
make
up
her
mind.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
heard
what
you
said.
