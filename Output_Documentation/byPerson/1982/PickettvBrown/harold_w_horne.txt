mr.
harold
w.
horne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
tennessee's
two-year
statute
of
limitations
governing
paternity
and
child
support
actions
for
illegitimate
children
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
in
gomez
v.
perez,
this
court
held
that
once
a
state
posits
a
judicially
enforceable
right
of
children
to
support
from
their
natural
fathers,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
the
state
from
denying
the
same
right
to
illegitimate
children.
last
year
this
court,
in
the
case
of
mills
v.
habluetzel
considered
texas's
response
to
gomez
and
found
that
texas's
one
year
statute
of
limitations
was
unconstitutional.
in
mills
the
court
considered
two
criteria,
the
first
being
that
any
period
for
obtaining
support
must
be
sufficiently
long
in
duration
to
present
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
those
with
an
interest
in
the
child
to
assert
the
child's
right
to
paternal
support
and
second,
that
any
period
of
limitation
on
that
opportunity
must
be
substantially
related
to
the
state's
interest
in
avoiding
the
litigation
of
stale
and
fraudulent
claims.
this
court
found
that
in
the
mills
case,
the
mills
statute,
the
one
year
statute
of
limitations
failed
on
both
criteria.
and
the
same
reasoning
which
applied
in
texas's
case
applies
in
tennessee's,
or
to
tennessee's
two-year
statute
of
limitations.
but
in
addition,
in
tennessee,
we
have
three
additional
factors
which
further
the
conclusion
that
tennessee's
two-year
period
of
limitations
is
nothing
less
than
invidious
discrimination
toward
illegitimate
children.
the
first
is
that
in
tennessee's
two-year
statute
of
limitations
the
statute
applies
only
to
illegitimate
children
who
are
not
receiving
support
from
the
state
or
who
are
not,
in
terms
of
the
statute,
a
public
charge.
thus,
a
two-year,
nonwelfare,
illegitimate
child
whose
mother
fails
to
file
an
action
before
the
child
reaches
his
second
birthday
will
find
his
right
to
legitimation
and
to
receive
paternal
support
forever
terminated,
unless
the
child
sometime
in
the
future
goes
on
welfare,
receives
afdc
or
any
other
form
of
state
assistance,
and
becomes
a
public
charge,
at
which
time
the
statute
which
purportedly
had
run,
then
terminates
and
the
child
can
then,
on
behalf
of
any
person,
have
an
action
filed,
or
any
person
can
file
the
action
on
behalf
of
the
child
to
seek
the
paternal
support.
thus,
the
tennessee
legislature
itself
has
considered
that
claims
involving
paternity
and
paternal
support
do
not,
in
and
of
themselves,
become
stale
prior
to
18
years,
or
the
reign
of
18
years.
the
second
item,
and
it
comes
out
of
a
number
of
cases
this
court
has
previously
decided,
this
court
has
held
that
involving
the
death
of
a
father,
that
the
claim
of
a
state
or
the
right
of
a
state
to
legislate
discriminatory
treatment
can
be
rationally
related
or
substantially
related
to
the
state's
interest
in
the
orderly
disposition
of
estates.
however,
in
tennessee,
were
the
defendant
braxton
brown
to
die
today,
young
pickett
could
go
into
the
tennessee
court
and
sue
his
father's
estate
and
if
he
could
meet
the
heightened
standard
of
proof,
being
now
more
than
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
less
than
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
his
father
had,
in
fact,
the
defendant
or
the
decedent
was
his
father,
he
could
proceed...
could
get
a
judgment
and
could
be
allowed
to
receive
part
of
his
father's
estate.
now
if
the
issue
in
today's
case
were
the
right
of
young
pickett
to
proceed
against
a
decedent's
estate,
i
would
have
to
agree
with
the
court
that
perhaps
the
claim
could
be
stale
and
certainly
would
possess
the
potential
for
being
fraudulent,
yet
again,
the
tennessee
legislature,
or
the
tennessee
courts
have
decided
that
the
mere
death
of
the
father,
of
the
purported
father,
does
not
cause
a
claim
to
be
stale
or
so
possessed
with
the
problems
of
being
fraudulent
as
to
terminate
that
cause
or
right
of
action.
third
additional
consideration
is
that
in
tennessee
the
statute
itself
says
that
the
purpose
is
to
provide
for
the
support,
education
and
welfare
of
illegitimate
children.
on
the
front
end
of
tennessee's
statute,
they
again
say
that
the
fathers
are
responsible
for
the
welfare
and
support
of
their
illegitimate
children.
now
obviously,
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
statute
is
to
prevent
the
likelihood
that
the
illegitimate
child
will
be
placed
upon
the...
or
placed
in
need
of
support
from
the
taxpayers
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
you
won't
find
it
in
the
record,
your
honor,
because
i
didn't
come
into
this
case
until
the
statute
of
limitations
issue
has
already
been
raised
and
we
went
straight
from
that
issue
to
the
supreme
court,
but
in
this
case,
mrs.
pickett,
when
she
became
pregnant
was
so
embarrassed,
she
told
me,
that
she
immediately
left
the
town
that
she
was
living
in,
memphis,
moved
down
into
mississippi
with
her
child
to
give
birth
in
a
community
where
nobody
knew
her
and
where
she
could
hide
her
shame.
she
told
me
that
she
filed
this
lawsuit
when
her
child
reached
about
nine
years
of
age,
he
started
saying
well,
who's
my
father
and
how
come
i
don't
have
his
name
and
why
isn't
his
name
on
my
birth
certificate
and
it
was
at
the
request
of
her
son
that
he
be
given
an
opportunity
to
have
his
father's
name
that
she
filed
this
lawsuit.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
well,
certainly
in
tennessee
i
would
agree
that
that
is
my
position
because
of
the
other
factors,
but
i
would
argue,
likewise,
that
in
any
state
irrespective
of
what
factors
were
considered,
that
there
is
no
logical
reason
for
denying
an
illegitimate
child
the
right
to
seek
paternal
support
where
the
legitimate
child
is
provided
that
right.
and
i
would
go
further
and
say,
if
a
state
were
to
say,
well,
legitimate
children
don't
have
the
right
to
support
from
their
fathers,
i
would
find
constitutional
flaw
with
that
argument
as
well.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
well,
i
haven't
given
as
much
consideration
to
that
possibility
as
i
have
in
this
case,
but
my
initial
reaction,
your
honor,
is
to
say
that
any
statute
of
limitations
which
affects
a
child's
right
to
know
his
father,
to
have
his
father's
name,
the
name
on
the
birth
certificate,
and
the
right
to
receive
support
from
both
parents
would
be
an
unconstitutional
deprivation
of
both
equal
protection...
equal
rights,
rather
and
due
process.
the
reason,
the
only--
mr.
harold
w.
horne
--i
think
it
would,
your
honor,
because
in
the
context
of
paternity,
and
let
me
say
i'd
have
more
difficulty
with
it,
it's
something
i
haven't
thought
about
in
great
depth,
but
in
the
context
of
child
support,
the
only
purpose
for
which
a
state
can
pass
a
limitations
period
on
an
illegitimate
child's
right
to
support
would
be
the
prevention
of
stale
and
fraudulent
claims.
i
think
that
was
the
position
taken
by
both
opinions
in
the
mill
case.
and
i
see
no
potential
for
stale
claims,
or
i
don't
see
a
child
support
claim
becoming
stale
during
the
minority
of
the
child.
it
certainly
doesn't
become
stale
for
a
child
that's
presumed
to
have
a
father.
one
way
of
looking
at
it
is
this,
perhaps.
if
a
couple
is
married,
and
this
happens
all
the
time
nowadays,
they
get
a
divorce
and
the
father's
trying
to
avoid
his
obligation
of
support,
he
disclaims
the
child
and
says
this
isn't
my
child
anyway,
even
though
it
was
born
during
the
course
of
this
marriage.
he
takes
an
hla
blood
test.
the
blood
test
comes
back
and
says
he's
not
the
father.
he
then
has
a
right
to
avoid
the
child
support
obligation
there.
the
child
is,
in
essence,
bastardized
by
that
process
and
if
you
have
a
period
of
limitations
on
the
child's
right
to
seek
support
from
whoever
his
true
father
turns
out
to
be,
you've
afforded
a
man
a
right
to
avoid
supporting
his
illegitimate
children
without
affording
the
illegitimate
child
an
opportunity
to
locate
his
real
father
and
seek
support
from
the
real
father.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
yes,
sir.
every
action
which
a
minor
child
has
during
his
minority
is
tolled
for
the
period
of
the
minority
plus
the
period
of
limitations
after
the
child
reaches
minority
so
that,
in
tennessee,
this
was
going
to
get
toward
the
end
of
my
argument,
but
the
only
action
which
is
terminated
for
the
illegitimate
child,
or
for
any
child
rather,
is
the
action
of
paternity
or
seeking
paternal
support.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
there
is
a
bill
presently
before
the
state
legislature
which
i
understand
two
weeks
ago
made
it
out
of
committee
to
the
floor,
but
has
not
been
passed
yet,
last
i
heard,
which
provides
that
the
department
of
human
services
in
contested
paternity
cases,
is
to
provide
to
defendants
an
hla
blood
test,
which
would
be
paid
for
by
the
state
initially,
with
cost
to
be
allocated
based
upon
the
abilities
of
the
parties
to
pay
for
it
thereafter,
and
the
results
of
the
blood
test
would
be
made
admissible
in
the
court
proceedings
either
to
exclude
paternity
or
to
prove
a
probability
of
paternity.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
it
is
admissible
to
disprove
paternity.
it
is
not
admissible
to
prove
a
likelihood
or
plausibility
of
paternity.
now
tennessee's
statue...
two-year
statute
of
limitations,
which
purportedly
has
for
its
purpose,
the
intent
to
prevent
the
child
from
becoming
a
public
charge
to
the
state,
actually
has
the
reverse
effect.
a
mother
such
as
miss
pickett,
in
this
case,
who
finds
that
her
cause
of
action
is
terminated
by
the
two-year
statute
of
limitations
need
only
swallow
her
pride
a
little
bit
and
go
down
to
the
welfare
office
and
apply
for
state
assistance
to
find
that
her
child
then
has
a
right.
the
state
will
then
pay
for
the
litigation,
file
a
lawsuit
and
proceed
for
her
child
without
a
statute
of
limitations.
so
the
effect
is
to
encourage
women
who
find
that
the
statute
has
already
run
to
place
their
children
on
the
welfare
roles
and
seek
additional
support
from
the
state,
which
is
the
opposite
intent
of
the
statue.
the
intent
of
the
statute
is
to
see
to
it
that
fathers
support
their
offspring.
the
tennessee
supreme
court's
response
to
this
was
also
somewhat
surprising.
relying
upon
an
old
new
york
case
in
the
matter
of
mores
v.
feel,
the
legislature...
tennessee
supreme
court,
relying
upon
their
opinion,
found
that
the
legislature's
only
interest
was
to
see
to
it
that
some
one
person
supported
an
illegitimate
child,
as
opposed
to
what
the
statute
purportedly
claims
on
the
front
end,
that
there
is
an
intent
that
both
parents
should
be
equally
responsible
for
the
support
of
their
illegitimate
offspring.
this
amounts
to
an
open
declaration
and
acknowledgment,
i
believe,
of
invidious
discrimination
flying
in
the
face
of
gomez.
tennessee
is
saying,
on
the
one
hand,
well,
both
parents
are
responsible
for
the
support
of
their
illegitimate
children,
but
on
the
other
hand,
illegitimate
children
must
be
supported
only
by
some
one
person,
that's
all
we're
really
concerned
about,
and
if
that
one
person
can't
provide
the
support,
then
we'll
set
the
statute
of
limitations
aside
and
allow
the
state
to
proceed
to
litigate
the
claim.
what
tennessee,
in
reality,
is
saying
is
that
it's
the
woman's
fault
she
became
pregnant.
let
her
take
care
of
the
problem.
the
man
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
it's
a
blatant
declaration
of
male
supremacy
and
i
believe
it's
a
throwback
to
the
days
when
state
laws
were
made
by
male
legislatures
to
and
for
the
protection
of
male
legislatures.
as
i
mentioned
just
a
moment
ago
in
response
to
your
question,
and
the
same
as
in
the
texas
case,
mills
v.
habluetzel,
in
tennessee
this
is
the
only
cause
of
action
which
is
not
tolled
for
the
minor
illegitimate
child.
every
other
cause
of
action
will
be...
the
period
of
limitations
will
be
tolled
and
the
child
will
be
allowed
to
proceed
after
it
reaches
its
minority.
the
only
apparent
answer
then,
i
think,
is
that
in
child
support
cases
is
concerned,
and
we've
got
to
ask
that
why
is
it
only
in
child
support
cases
that
we
have
the
statute
not
tolled
in
tennessee
and
i
believe
the
response
is,
it's
the
legislature's
intention
to
visit
society's
condemnation
for
the
illicit
relationship
outside
the
bonds
of
marriage
upon
the
child.
it's
a
statement
of
policy
that
we
do
not
approve
of
you
fathering
children,
or
mothering
children
outside
the
bonds
of
wedlock
and
lacking
an
ability,
perhaps,
to
punish
either
of
the
parents,
the
legislature
determined
that
it's
the
child
that
should
bear
the
brunt
of
society's
disapproval.
all
considered,
then,
i
argue
that
the
two-year
statute
of
limitations
cannot
be
justified
as
being
substantially
related
to
the
state's
interest
in
preventing
stale
and
fraudulent
claims
and,
in
fact,
even
under
the
reasonable
relationship
test,
there
is
no
reasonable
relationship...
or
reasonable
support
for
the
argument
that
the
two-year
statute
of
limitations
is
going
to
prevent
stale
or
fraudulent
claims.
one
last
point
is
that
in
a
number
of
this
court's
opinions,
i've
noticed
references
to
a
state
has
a
right
to
make
some
legislation
to
take
care
of
the
problems,
the
difficult
problems
of
proof
in
paternity
cases,
i
think
that's
the
way
it's
referred
to.
i've,
in
the
past
five
years,
handled
probably
a
little
better
than
2,500
paternity
cases
and
i've
failed
to
understand
what
the
difficult
problems
in
proof
of
paternity
cases
is
really
referring
to.
in
those
cases
where
we're
referring
to
the
purported
father
having
passed
away,
i
acknowledge
that
there
are
some
difficult
problems
of
proof.
the
man
ought
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
defend
himself.
but
where
the
man
is
around,
there
is
only
two
people
that
know
whether
relations
occurred.
it's
the
man
and
the
woman
and
they're
always
going
to
be
around
in
the
context
of
the
paternity
case
and
it's
the
woman
who
has
to
prove
her
case.
she's
got
to
prove
by
the
greater
weight
of
the
evidence
that
this
man
is
the
father
of
the
child.
if
the
passage
of
time
is
going
to
cause
a
likelihood
that
witnesses
have
disappeared,
memories
have
faded,
the
same
thing's
going
to
happen
to
the
woman.
and
i've
tried
cases
where
16
years
after
the
birth
of
the
child,
the
woman
gets
up
there,
she
can't
remember
dates,
times
and
places,
and
it
affects
her
cases,
it
affects
her
ability
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof
and
it
helps
the
defendant
in
his
claim
that
he's
not
the
father
of
the
child.
so,
the
difficult
problems
of
proof,
i
would
argue,
apply
to
the
woman
more
than
they
do
to
the
man.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
well,
it
would
be
as
reliable
and
actually,
considering
hla
blood
testing
nowadays,
it
would
be
more
reliable
than
an
automobile
accident
or
contract
case
that
was
brought
by
the
child
20
years
after
the
child
was
born.
because
the
period
of
limitations
in
those
cases
would
be
18
years
plus
the
original
period
of
limitations
so
the
problem--
mr.
harold
w.
horne
--i
would
have
to
agree
with
your
honor
and
make
one
exception
and
that's
because
of
the
statutory
structure
in
tennessee.
the
legislature,
having
determined
that
it
can
be
18
years
for
a
child
who
is
or
is
about
to
become
a
public
charge
is
determined
at
18
years
is
not
too
long
in
tennessee
for
the
prosecution
of
paternity
claims.
if
the
statute
had
been
written,
much
as
the
maryland
statute
was,
i
think
at
two
years
for
a
child,
well,
two
years
is
too
short
anyway,
i'd
argue,
but
let's
say
it
was
ten
years
for
a
child
who
is
about
to
become
a
public
charge
or
who
has
never
received
welfare,
so
it's
the
same
all
the
way
across
the
board,
i
think
my
argument
would
be
more
difficult.
i
would
still
argue
that
ten
years
is
too
short
for
the
child,
but
your
honor's
point
is,
on
the
whole,
accurate
that
a
legislature
does
have
a
right
to
determine
what
period
of
time
is
just
too
long
for
a
case
to
be
prosecuted
in
the
courts.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
well,
i've
handled
over
2,500.
i've
specialized,
of
course
in
tennessee
we're
not
allowed
to
specialize,
but
i
have
specialized
in
the
prosecution
of
paternity
cases.
not
all
2,500
have
gone
to
trial,
but
there's
some
weeks
where
i
tried
six,
seven
cases
in
the
same
week.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
a
large
majority
of
them
are,
i'm
on
a
contract
with
the
state
department
of
human
services
to
prosecute
on
a
case
by
case
basis
cases
that
they
turn
over
to
me
for
investigation.
they
just
hand
me
a
claim
and
allegation
on
behalf
of
the
mother
that
the
child
has
a
father
and
this
is
the
father
and
it's
my
obligation
to
locate
the
father
and
make
the
determination
whether
he
acknowledge
his
child
or
not
and
if
not,
to
prosecute
the
claim
in
court.
if,
upon
investigating
the
mother's
claim,
i
find
that
there's
a
reasonable
basis
for
presuming
that
the--
mr.
harold
w.
horne
--well
in
19...
my
recollection
is
that
memphis,
tennessee
has
the
highest
birth
rate
per
capita
of
illegitimate
children,
varying
month
to
month,
with
atlanta,
georgia.
we're
sort
of
in
a
neck
and
neck
contest.
[laughter]
and
in
that
respect,
in
1975
when
we
started...
1976
when
we
started
this
program,
we
had
20,000
paternity
cases
backlogged
on
the
welfare
roles.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
so,
my
firm
has
handled
a
little
better
than
5,000
of
those
cases.
we've
done
more
than
any
other
group
of
attorneys
put
together,
but
it's
still
just
a
dent
in
the
bucket.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
i've
provided
some
statistics
in
the
back
of
my
brief
indicating
the
percentage,
i
believe
51
or
53
percent
of
children
born
to
black
parents
are
illegitimate
and
something
like
14
to
15
percent
of
children
to
whites
are
illegitimate.
the
total
number,
i
can't
recall.
it
seems
like
something
like
16,000
in
the
state
of
tennessee
a
year,
but
i
can't
recall.
it's
a
substantial
and
it's
a
growing,
growing
phenomenon,
not
only
in
tennessee
but
across
the
nation.
the
birth
of
illegitimate
children
has
been
on
the
increase
throughout
the
last
20
years
and
the
argument
that
was
put
forward
in
some
previous
cases
that
the
state
legislature
can
limit
the
period
of
proving
paternity
because
a
state
has
a
policy
of
fostering
family
relations
is
just
shown
not
to
be
true,
that,
in
fact,
family
relations
are
breaking
down.
we
have
more
and
more
one
parent
families
not
only
illegitimate
but
from
marriages
that
are
breaking
up.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
in
tennessee,
relatively
few.
my
guess
would
be
maybe
seven
or
eight
percent
at
the
very
highest.
by
and
large,
i
have
found
that
when
i
offer
to
a
male
defendant
the
opportunity
for
an
hla
blood
test
which
will
show
a
likelihood
that
he
is
the
father
but
at
the
same
time
not
be
admissible,
he
has
no
desire
to
submit
to
the
examination.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
initially,
it's
the
defendant's
response,
the
court's,
in
response
to
the
connecticut
case
out
of
this
court,
have
held
that
where
the
defendant
can
show
the
court
that
he
has
no
means
of
income,
that
he
has
no
property
and
no
ability
to
properly
defend
himself
other
than
by
using
the
hla
blood
test,
the
circuit
courts
have
been
ordering
the
department
of
human
services
to
pay
for
the
blood
test
for
such
a
person.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
four-hundred
and
fifty
dollars
in
memphis.
that's
if
you
do
not
use
the
enzyme-protein,
protein-enzyme
testing.
the
only
lab
we
can
use
that
type
of
testing
in
is
minneapolis
and
that's
only
proved
of
some
benefit
where
the
claim
is
that
one
of
two
brothers
or
an
uncle
and
a
father,
or
something
like
that,
are
potentially
the
father
of
the
child
and
we're
trying
to
eliminate
which
one
of
them
might
be
and
might
not
be.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
some
places
it's
$750.
some
places
it's
a
little
cheaper.
i
think
it
is
a
little
out
of
line.
the
problem
is
we
have
virtually
a
monopoly
in
tennessee.
there's
only
one
lab
now
that
will
perform
the
hla
blood
testing
and
tennessee's
legislature
passed
a
law
that
said
that
blood
testing
must
be
performed
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
has
some
logic
behind
it.
it's
to
make
sure
that
you
can
get
the
doctor
who
performed
the
examination
into
court
to
testify
as
to
chain
of
custody
and
all.
if
you
send
it
to
california,
you've
got
a
chain
of
custody
problem.
but
if
we
were
allowed
to
send
it
outside
of
the
state,
we
could
get
it
done
cheaper
and
i
think
that
if
the
legislature
passes
the
bill
that's
before
it
now
requiring
the
department
to
pay
for
the
test
in
all
cases
where
you
can
order
the
man
to
and
the
woman
to
submit,
that
we'll
be
able
to
work
out
an
agreement
with
the
hospital
to
mass
produce
them
at
a
much,
much
cheaper
expense.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
baptist
memorial
hospital
in
memphis.
there
was
a
test
being
performed
by
dr.
james
mason
at
the
university
of
tennessee
hospital
but
his
primary
responsibilities
are
the
training
and
education
of
pathologists
and
he
found
that
it
was
just
taking
up
too
much
of
his
time
to
have
to
perform
the
tests,
respond
to
attorney's
questions
and
appear
in
court
from
time
to
time
to
justify
his
findings.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
we've
had
that
for
awhile,
your
honor.
[laughter]
thank
you.
i'll
reserve
my
time.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
respondent's
last
comment
that
it's
not
so
easy
to
get
on
welfare,
that's
one
of
the
amazing
parts
of
our
welfare
system
in
this
country.
all
a
mother
has
to
do
is,
the
simplest
routine
is
to
turn
her
child
over
to
a
welfare
agency,
say
i
can
no
longer
handle
or
take
care
of
my
child.
she
will
be
required
by
the
courts
to
furnish
support
herself
for
the
child
but
then
the
child
then
becomes
a
public
charge.
whoever
takes
custody,
which
could
be
a
grandmother,
will
be
able
to
receive
welfare
benefits
and
the
child
is
thus
eligible
to
pass
over
on
the
two-year
statute
of
limitations.
on
the
question
you
asked,
chief
justice
burger,
which
was
what
is
the
real
reason
for
the
denial,
is
that
paternity
or
support,
in
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases,
the
issue
is
a
man
just
doesn't
want
to
be
placed
under
a
court
order
to
provide
support
on
a
regular,
weekly
basis
or
semi-weekly
or
monthly,
because
he
knows
that
if
he
fails
to
make
his
payments,
he's
subject
to
criminal
prosecution
and
jail
time
and
i
really
think--
mr.
harold
w.
horne
--in
a
vast
majority
of
the
cases,
it's
economic.
counsel
for
the
state
argues
that
i
have
conceded
that
there
are
difficult
problems
of
proof.
i
do
not
by
any
means
concede
that
there
are
difficult
problems
of
proof.
my
statement
was
i
do
not
understand
some
of
the
references
to
it
in
the
past,
because
if
there
are
problems,
the
problems
will
belong
to
the
mother
more
than
they
will
for
the
man,
and
it
does
not
lend
to
the
argument
that
this
two-year
statute,
in
tennessee
at
any
rate,
supports
the
state's
intention
of
preventing
fraudulent
or
stale
claims.
the
counsel
argues,
also,
that
if
a
woman
gets
on
welfare
that
within
one
year,
should
she
get
on
welfare
for
one
year
and
then
get
back
off,
the
child
will
become
legitimate.
it
normally
takes
the
welfare
department
a
year
to
prosecute
their
paperwork
just
to
get
it
down
to
my
level.
and
if
there's
a
denial
of
paternity,
in
tennessee
courts,
it's
taken
five
to
eight
years
to
get
a
case
through
the
court
which,
although
there's
no
written
literature,
i
can
refer
the
court
to
to
support
that
claim,
it's
from
my
experience.
and
you've
got
to
wonder,
at
the
same
time,
if
it
takes
eight
years
to
get
a
case
through
the
courts,
it's
going
to
get
just
as
stale
going
through
eight
years.
memories
are
going
to
fade
during
that
eight
year
period
just
as
much
as
they
will
if
there
were
no
period
of
limitations.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
yes,
sir.
i'm
talking
about
the
trial
level--
mr.
harold
w.
horne
--to
get
into
the
circuit
court
before
a
jury,
it
takes
five
to
eight
years
in
the
courts
of
shelby
county.
i
think
this,
there's
a
reference
in
my
brief,
to
legislative
findings
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
that
child
support
matters...
child
support
matters
in
general
are
an
area
that
the
courts,
judges
and
lawyers
in
this
country
cannot
be
proud
of.
that
this
is
an
area
that
judges
do
not
like
to
get
into.
they
hate
to
get
involved
in
domestic
squabbles
about
support
and
they
do
any
excuse
to
continue
the
case
and
it
gets
put
off.
we've
got
a
rule
in
the
circuit
court
of
shelby
county
that
only
so
many
cases
will
be
heard
per
term.
what
it
amounts
to
is
five
paternity
cases
will
be
heard
every
two
months
for
ten
months
out
of
the
12-month
year.
and
that's
all
they
will
hear,
where
we've
got
2,000
to
3,000
cases
backlogged
before
the
circuit
court
waiting
for
jury
trials.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
i
don't
think...
the
state
has
a
right
to
make
a
period
of
limitations
and
by
the
very
nature
of
a
statute
of
limitations,
the
period
is
left
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
legislature
and
it
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
by
its
very
nature.
the
legislature,
having
determined
that
18
years
is
appropriate
for
support
cases,
is
entitled
to
make
that
decision
and
i
think
the
court's
bound
to
stick
by
the
decision.
the
question
is
whether
they
can
then
limit
it
to
two
years
for
the
very
limited
group
that
do
not
apply
for
welfare
on
the
pretext
that
it
prevents
fraudulent
or
stale
claims.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
well,
frankly,
your
honor,
i
would
be
satisfied
with
the
period
of
minority
plus
the
period
after
minority
which
would,
in
this
particular
case
in
tennessee,
be
the
age
of
20
for
the
child,
giving
the
child
the
right
to,
once
he
reaches
18--
mr.
harold
w.
horne
--for
the
mother,
18
years.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
on
the
basis
that--
mr.
harold
w.
horne
--well,
from
the
state's
perspective,
your
honor--
mr.
harold
w.
horne
--i
don't
understand
your
honor's
question.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
yes,
sir,
in
a
context--
mr.
harold
w.
horne
--you
mean
a
mother
who
gives
birth
to
an
illegitimate
child?
mr.
harold
w.
horne
your
honor,
from
the
perspective
of
the
state,
there's
two
reasons
for
granting
to
the
mother
the
right
to
make
that
important
decision.
the
first
is
that
she
will,
as
your
honor
indicates,
have
the
capacity
for
maturity
and
the
ability
to
make
a
judgment
on
behalf
of
the
child
which
the
child
can't
make.
and
the
second
is
that,
and
this
is
important,
the
second
is
that
she
will
act
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
and
i
think
when
either
of
those
to
premises
is
undermined,
the
right
of
the
state
to
make
the
assumption
that
she
is
the
best
person
falters.
here,
if
your
honor
will
take
a
look
at
the
case
of
reynolds
v.
richardson,
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs,
and
is
right
on
point,
the
mother
in
that
case
accepted
a
$500
payment
from
the
father
of
the
child
in
exchange
for
release
of
the
child's
right
to
legitimation
and
future
support.
and,
according
to
pickett
v.
brown
out
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee,
that
release
is
now
effective.
she
has
terminated
for
$500
payment
the
child's
right
to
support.
i
would
question,
your
honor,
in
response
to
your
question,
whether
that
is
a
rational
decision,
whether
that
decision
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
and
let's
say
that
she
was
45
years
old.
her
interests
are
going
to
be
still
a
fondness
for
the
purported
father,
perhaps,
a
desire
not
to
get
into
a
conflict
with
him
or
his
family
by
dragging
him
into
court
knowing
that
if
she
takes
him
to
court
that
he's
going
to
be
subject
to
possible--
mr.
harold
w.
horne
--yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
w.
horne
in
this
particular--
mr.
harold
w.
horne
--well,
your
honor,
she
has
18
years
because--
mr.
harold
w.
horne
--well,
i'm
saying
that
she
should,
but
she
has
only
18
years
in
tennessee
to
make
up
her
mind
because
if
the
child
were
a
public
charge,
then
that
child
would
have
18
years
to...
she
would
have
18
years
there
to
make
up
her
mind
as
well.
if
she
applied
for
welfare
on
the
17th
birthday
of
her
son,
the
son
would
be
entitled
to
have
an
action
brought,
either
by
her,
or
by
any
other
person
in
the
state
of
tennessee
and
what
you
have
is
discrimination
between
what
amounts
to
two
sub-classes
or
illegitimate
children.
you
have
illegitimate
children
on
welfare
and
illegitimate
children
not
on
welfare
and
there's
discriminatory
treatment
by
the
state
of
tennessee.
this
group
is
allowed
to
prosecute
a
claim.
this
group
is
not
and
there's
not
a
rational
basis
for
that
differentiation,
let
alone
a
substantial
basis.
did
i
answer
your
question?
mr.
harold
w.
horne
thank
you.
