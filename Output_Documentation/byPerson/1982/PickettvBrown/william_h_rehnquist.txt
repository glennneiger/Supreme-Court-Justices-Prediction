justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
horne,
what
about
a
state
which
doesn't
toll
any
statute
during
minority?
that
is,
the
statute
runs
against
minors,
not
just
on
legitimation
claims,
but
on
contract
claims,
tort
claims
and
the
like.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
wouldn't
be
a
equal
protection
violation,
would
it,
if
all
causes
of
action
of
minors
are
treated
the
same?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
not
an
equal
protection
claim,
though,
i
wouldn't
think.
well,
at
any
rate,
does
tennessee
have
a
general
tolling
statute
for
causes
of
action
accruing
to
minors
until
they
come
of
age?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
the
legislature,
quite
apart
from
the
conduct
of
paternity
suits,
have
an
interest,
or
isn't
it
legitimate
for
the
legislature
to
say
we
don't
want
that
kind
of
a
case
to
be
tried
16
years
after
the
events
in
which
it
happened.
sure,
it's
going
to
hurt
both
parties,
but
the
judicial
determination
on
the
evidence
16
years
later
is
just
not
sufficiently
reliable
to
allow
the
case
to
proceed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
an
equal
protection
argument
and
you
may
well
be
right
on
that,
but
i
think
a
legislature,
or
would
you
disagree
with
the
observation
of
a
legislature,
if
it
acted
even-handedly,
could
say
that
there
are
just
some
passages
of
time
that
are
too
long
to
allow
for
an
accurate
determination
of
facts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
perhaps
that
argument
was
directed
also
to
the
independent
right
of
the
child
to
bring
an
action
for
support,
or
does
tennessee
law
recognize
an
independent
action
for
the
child?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
in
this
case,
was
the
mother
the
only
person
who
could
have
brought
the
action
at
the
time
it
was
brought
under
tennessee
law?
