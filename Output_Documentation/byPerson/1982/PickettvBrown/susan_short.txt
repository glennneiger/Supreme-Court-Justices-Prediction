ms.
susan
short
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant's
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
tennessee's
paternity
statute
and
the
two-year
limitation
limiting
the
opportunity
to
establish
the
duty
of
the
father
to
support
illegitimate
children
relies
substantially
upon
this
court's
recent
decision
in
mills
v.
habluetzel.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
is
litigation
between
private
litigants.
mrs.
pickett
and
mr.
brown
have
no
relationship
at
all
to
the
state.
the
attorney
general
of
tennessee
has
intervened
in
this
action
for
the
sole
purpose
of
defending
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute.
under
tennessee
law,
when
a
state
statute
is
challenged,
a
party
is
required
to
give
notice
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
then
has
the
option
of
either
defending
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
or
certifying
to
the
legislature
that
he
cannot
so
defend
that
statute.
we,
of
course,
have
chosen
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute,
because
we
believe
that,
based
upon
this
court's
analysis
in
mills
v.
habluetzel,
that
it
is,
in
fact,
constitutional.
last
year,
this
court
considered
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations
on
the
case
of
mills.
that
statute
in
texas
is
substantially
different
from
the
tennessee
statute.
tennessee
statute
which
is
challenged
on
this
appeal
provides
that
an
action
to
establish
paternity
must
be
initiated
within
two
years
after
the
birth
of
the
child.
there
are
several
exceptions
provided
to
this
general
two-year
limitation.
these
exceptions
include
if
the
father
has
acknowledged
the
paternity
of
the
child
in
writing,
the
action
may
be
brought
at
any
time.
if
the
father
has
furnished
support
to
the
child,
the
action
may
be
brought
at
any
time.
ms.
susan
short
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
in
reynolds
v.
richardson
addressed
that
issue.
they
have
stated
that
there
need
not
be
substantial
or
continuous
support
payments
by
the
father
in
order
to
toll
the
statute
under
tennessee
law.
ms.
susan
short
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
when,
in
fact,
support
has
been
provided
that
there
is
a
greater
likelihood
that
you
can
produce
additional
proof
other
than
the
testimony
of
the
parties.
there's
likely
to
be
a
check,
there's
likely
to
be
some
receipts.
there's
likely
to
be
other
witnesses
who
have
evidenced
this
act
on
behalf
of
the
defendant.
the
other
exceptions
to
tennessee's
general
two-year
statute
of
limitation
include
the
public
charge
exception.
an
action
may
be
brought
on
behalf
of
any
child
under
the
age
of
18
who
is
or
is
liable
to
become
a
public
charge.
also--
ms.
susan
short
--the
state
is
allowed
to
bring
that
action
as
long
as
the
child
is
dependant
upon
the
state
for
support
and
that
is
18
years.
that
is
during
the
minority
of
the
child.
ms.
susan
short
no.
at
that
point,
your
honor,
the
state--
ms.
susan
short
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
susan
short
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
short
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
short
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
are
differing
state
interests
which
compel
the
different
limitations
on
these
actions.
ms.
susan
short
if,
in
fact,
the
child
was
on
welfare,
your
honor,
that
action
would
be
brought
by
the
department
of
human
services
at
the
time
when
they
are
on
welfare.
after
that
time
the
mother
can
take
advantage
of
the
establishment
of
paternity
that
took
place
on
behalf
of
the
state
in
the
interest
of
that
child.
i
believe
it's
necessary
for
me
to
clarify--
ms.
susan
short
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
counsel
has
acknowledged
that
there
continues
to
be
a
difficulty
of
proof,
notwithstanding
the
longer
limitation
of
the
state.
we
submit--
ms.
susan
short
--we
believe
that
the
state
has
a...
that
the
state's
interest
in
those
actions
where
children
are
public
charges
is
different.
ms.
susan
short
no,
what
we're
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
society--
ms.
susan
short
--i
believe
that--
ms.
susan
short
--that's
correct.
ms.
susan
short
we
believe
that
society's
interest
in
insuring
that
children
are
supported
by
those
who--
ms.
susan
short
--i
think
that
in
light
of
this
court's
opinions
with
respect
to
the
protection
which
must
be
afforded
or
defended
when
the
state
is
a
party
clearly
addressed
the
point
which
you've
raised,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
short
the
dispute
is...
the
issue
there
is
paternity,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
short
paternity.
paternity
is
the
issue.
ms.
susan
short
your
honor,
in
the
actions
which
i've
had
an
opportunity
to
participate
in,
the
denial
is
of
paternity
at
that
point
and
not
of
support.
i
believe
the
issue
of
support
arises
only
after
paternity
has
been
established.
i
would
like--
ms.
susan
short
--i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that--
ms.
susan
short
--during
that
one
year
period
of
time
the
state
has
likely
established
paternity
at
that
time.
ms.
susan
short
if
the
child
is
a
public
charge,
yes.
ms.
susan
short
yes.
ms.
susan
short
your
honor,
we
concede
that
the
claims
are
just
as
stale
when
they're
brought
two
years
or
18
years.
we
simply
submit
to
this
court
that
the
state
has
additional
interests
which
must
be
served
by
a
shorter
period
of
limitation
when
these
actions
are
between
private
litigants.
when
the
state
becomes
a
party
in
these
actions,
then
society
is
burdened
with
the
support
of
these
children.
we
believe
that
society
has
the
interest
in
allowing
their
public
funds
to
be
used
for
the
public
and
not
for
the
support
of
illegitimate
children.
ms.
susan
short
your
honor,
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
if
a
mother
is,
in
fact,
on
welfare
within
her
first
year,
that
paternity
will
not
be
established
on
her
behalf
by
the
department
of
human
services.
at
that
point
the
mother
can
then
collect
support
based
upon
that
prior
establishment
of
paternity.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
address
the
tolling
issue,
which
has
been
raised
by
appellant,
both
in
his
argument
and
in
the
brief.
under
tennessee
law,
if
a
minor
plaintiff
in
a
paternity
action
has
a
child,
she
has
until
two
years
after
she
reaches
her
age
of
majority
to
bring
that
action.
unlike
the
appellant's
statement,
this
is
not
a
statute
which
operates
in
favor
of...
against
the
interests
of
the
child.
we
attempt
to
protect
the
interests
of
minor
plaintiffs
by
allowing
them
the
additional
time
within
which
to
bring
those
actions.
ms.
susan
short
under
our
paternity
statute,
your
honor,
the
action
to
establish
support
lies
with
the
mother,
unless
the
mother
is
disabled
or
is
deceased,
at
which
time,
the
action
may
be
brought
by
the
child
through
a
guardian
or
next
friend
or
i
would
submit,
if
the
action
is
not
brought
on
behalf
of
the
child
during
its
minority,
then
he
may
bring
that
action
thereafter.
ms.
susan
short
i
think
that
under
the
facts,
your
honor,
that
the
mother
was
not...
the
child
was
not
a
public
charge
and
the
mother,
or
her
personal
representative,
could
have
brought
this
action
on
behalf
of
the
child.
the
child
could
not
bring
this
action
and
i
think
the
tennessee
supreme
court
acknowledged
that
in
its
opinion,
determined
that
it
was
harmless
error
for
the
juvenile
court
to
allow
the
amendment
of
appellant's
petition
in
juvenile
court...
to
allow
the
action
to
be
brought
on
behalf
of
a
minor
child.
ms.
susan
short
no,
your
honor.
i
think
quite
the
contrary.
ms.
susan
short
your
honor,
i
find
it
difficult
to
imagine
a
situation
where
the
mother
would
not
be
the
proper
person
to
bring
the
action
to
establish
paternity.
ms.
susan
short
well,
in
those
instances,
i
would
assume
that
the
mother
is
providing
support
for
that
child
and
perhaps
the
mother's
affections
for
that
father
are
that
great
you
would
think
that
he
would
also
be
providing
support
for
that
child.
so,
the
child's
interests
are
being
protected
in
that
instance.
and
that
is
our
concern.
ms.
susan
short
perhaps
so,
your
honor.
i
was
not
aware,
based
on
this
court's
opinion
in
mills,
that
the
child
had
the
right
to
bring
the
action,
but
i
assume
that
that
provision
of
the
statute
which
allowed
the
action
to
be
brought
by
any
person
certainly
could
include
the
child.
we
would
submit
that
the
mother
is
the
proper
person
to
bring
an
action
to
establish
paternity
and
that
she
is
in
a
better
position
than
most
to
determine
what
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
and
whether
or
not
paternity...
the
establishment
of
paternity
is,
in
fact,
in
that
child's
best
interest.
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case...
the
facts
of
this
case
are
particularly
relevant
to
this
court's
decision.
the
appellant
frances
pickett
brought
this
action
on
behalf
of
her
ten-year-old
son.
the
record
will
reflect
that
the
defendant
braxton
brown
had
never
acknowledged
the
child
in
writing,
nor
had
he
provided
support.
he
denied
that
he
had
ever
had
any
relations
at
all
with
the
appellant.
the
child
was
not
a
public
charge
and
yet
the
appellant
sought
to
bring
this
action
some
eight
years
after
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run.
as
appellant
has
acknowledged,
there
are
difficult
problems
with
proof,
faded
memories
in
these
actions.
he's
tried
all
of
these
cases
and
he's
acknowledged
that
that
is
the
one
problem.
we
submit
that
the
two-year
limitation
is
substantially
related
to
the
state's
interests
in
avoiding
the
loss
of
memory
and
the
loss
of
witnesses.
ms.
susan
short
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
short
i
believe
that
the
problem
still
exists.
however,
what
i
hope
to
convey
to
this
court
is
that
the
state's
interest
at
that
point
is
superior
to
the
interest
of--
ms.
susan
short
--the
state's
interest
in
insuring
that
these--
ms.
susan
short
--are
supported.
ms.
susan
short
with
respect
to
the
stale
and
fraudulent
claims,
we
would
say
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
also
submit
that
there
are
additional
interests
of
the
state
which
must
be
considered
by
this
court.
as
this
court
has
acknowledged
this
morning,
the
state
also
has
an
interest
in
limiting
litigation,
having
litigation
end
at
some
point.
and
we
believe
that
two
years
is
a
reasonable
time
within
which
litigation
should
end
in
paternity
actions.
also,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
the
welfare
of
its
children
and
we
believe
that
two
years...
within
two
years
the
relationship
which
can
be
established
between
the
mother
and
the
child
is
significant.
if
paternity
is
established
within
two
years,
the
mother
is
then
afforded
the
financial
assistance
which
she
can
gain
from
the
father
of
the
child.
thus,
the
child
is...
gets
the
benefit
of
those
financial
advantages.
in
addition,
the
child
is
not
forced
to
endure
the
emotional
and
psychological
difficulties
which
are
often
associated
with
the
illegitimate
status.
we
believe
that
two
years
is
a
reasonable
time
within
which
that
relationship
should
be
established
and
that
that,
in
fact,
is
in
the
interests
of
the
child.
i
believe
the
tennessee
statute,
based
upon
this
court's
analysis
in
mills,
is
reasonable.
in
mills,
this
court
stated
that
procedures
by
which
illegitimate
children
are
afforded
in
opportunity
to
obtain
paternal
support
need
not
be
coterminous
with
those
afforded
legitimate
children.
this
court
held
that
limitations
on
paternity
actions
would
be
upheld
as
constitutional
if
they
are
sufficiently
long
in
duration
to
afford
persons
with
valid
claims
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
assert
them.
we
believe
that
two
years
is
a
reasonable
time.
this
court
addressed
several
concerns
which
were
raised
by
the
texas
one-year
limitation
which
we
believe
are
alleviated
by
the
tennessee
two-year
limitation.
within
two
years,
a
woman
is
likely
to
have
sufficiently
recovered
from
the
physical
and
emotional
difficulties
associated
with
childbirth
and
be
in
a
position
where
she
can
assess
she
and
her
child's
situation
reasonably
and
realistically.
within
two
years
after
the
birth
of
a
child,
a
mother
is
not
likely
to
endure
the
same
financial
difficulties
which
she
may
face
within
one
year
after
the
birth
of
the
child.
it's
not
unreasonable
to
assume
that
within
two
years
after
the
birth
of
the
child
the
mother
has
returned
to
work
and
can
afford
to
seek
legal
advice
with
respect
to
her
responsibilities
and
obligations
and
those
of
the
fathers.
we
also
believe
that
two
years
is
a
reasonable
time
within
which
to
require
the
establishment
of
the
relationship
of
the
father
and
the
child.
i
also
believe
that
tennessee's
two-year
limitation
addresses
the
practical
obstacles
which
were
raised
by
this
court
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
o'connor.
these
concerns
included
the
emotional
and
psychological
difficulties.
as
i've
just
stated,
these
are
sufficiently
alleviated
by
the
two-year
limitation
and
the
financial
difficulties
which
were
raised
by
this
court.
we
would
also
submit
that
the
pressures
from
family
and
the
community
which
may
affect
the
mother's
bringing
an
action
within
one
year
are
sufficiently
alleviated
by
tennessee's
statute.
i
would
submit
that
these
pressures
would
bear
more
heavily
upon
a
minor
child
than
upon
an
adult.
under
tennessee
statute
the
two-year
limitation
is
tolled
for
minor
plaintiffs.
thus
she
has
two
years
after
reaching
her
majority
within
which
to
bring
those
actions.
counsel
has
alluded
to
the
fact
that
his
client
is
encouraged
to
seek
welfare.
i
would
submit
that
it
is
not
so
easy
to
go
on
welfare,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
record
before
this
court
will
show
that
the
plaintiff
has
substantial
assets.
she
owns
property.
i
believe
that
she
earns
approximately
$1,000
a
month.
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
her
to
qualify
under
the
welfare
laws.
we
would
also
submit
that
the
scheme
of
our
welfare
benefits...
the
scheme
of
our
welfare
system
is
such
that
we
could
easily
detect
any
fraud
which
may
be
perpetuated
or
encouraged
by
these
actions.
in
summary,
i
would
just
like
to
state
that
we
believe
the
tennessee
statute
affords
a
reasonable
opportunity
within
which
persons
with
valid
claims
may
assert
them.
further,
that
the
two-year
limitation
is
substantially
related
to
several
legitimate
state
interests.
these
include
the
state's
interest
in
avoiding
stale
and
fraudulent
claims;
the
state's
interest
in
repose;
and
the
state's
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
child.
the
practical
obstacles
to
bringing
an
action
which
were
applicable
to
the
texas
statute
are
not
present
under
tennessee
statutory
scheme.
we
would
submit
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee.
