mr.
horne,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
perhaps
it's
not
appropriate,
but
i'm
sure,
you
say
you
tried
2,500
of
these
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
these...
are
part
of
these
for
the
welfare
situation,
or
are
they
all
private?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
this
is
a
fairly
substantial
percentage
of
the
total
number
of
such
cases,
or
is
it,
i'm
just
not
familiar
with
the
volume
of
this
litigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
this
is
just
repetitive,
but
how
can
you
make
that
argument
if
she
could
go
on
welfare
and
then
the
action
could
be
brought
tomorrow.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
does
that
argument
deal
with
the
problem
if
she
goes
on
welfare
tomorrow,
she
could...
you
could
then
bring
the
action.
why
don't
the
faded
witnesses...
why
isn't
that
problem
still
right
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
state's
interest
in
getting
some
money
is
superior
to
the
child's
interest
in
establishing
his
relationship
with
his
father.
that's
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
state
it
fairly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
state's
interest
in
getting
its
money
back
is
superior
to
the
child's
interest
in
establishing
the
relationship
with
his
father?
