justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
your
position
that
no
statute
of
limitations
can
be
applied
to
an
illegitimate
child
during
the
minority
for
establishment
of
paternity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
practice
or
law
in
tennessee
regarding
the
leukocyte
antigen
test
for
paternity
actions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
those
blood
tests
admissible
today
in
evidence
in
tennessee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
horne,
in
what
percentage
of
the
cases
is
the
hla
test
employed,
in
your
experience?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
that
be
true,
for
example,
if
the
father
had
made
some
small
contribution
to
the
child
during
its
first
year
and
then
not
again?
would
the
statute
be
tolled
during
the
entire
minority
of
the
child?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
hard
to
see
how
that
furthers
the
state's
goal
then
to
eliminate
stale
claims
if
something
like
that
could
occur.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
that
be
true
for
the
state,
as
well,
if
the
period
of
time
that
the
child
was
on
welfare
was
very
brief,
the
state
would
still
have
up
to
18
years
to
bring
an
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
short,
in
your...
going
back
to
the
question
that
we
were
addressing,
under
the
tennessee
scheme,
if
the
child
received
welfare
for
a
brief
interval,
let's
say
in
the
first
year,
then
goes
off
welfare,
under
the
tennessee
scheme
the
mother
has
18
years
to
bring
a
paternity
action
for
the
child.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
that
isn't
done,
as
i
understand
the
tennessee
scheme,
the
mother
would
then
have
the
full
18
years
in
which
she
could
bring
the
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the
child
was
ever
a
public
charge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
the
stale
claim
argument
isn't
made
in
those
circumstances,
and
yet
the
circumstances
are
identical
to
the
situation
if
she
had
never
gotten
welfare.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
you've
just
acknowledged
that
it
would
be
waived
also
for
the
mother
if
the
state
didn't
bring
the
claim
after
the
brief
welfare
episode.
