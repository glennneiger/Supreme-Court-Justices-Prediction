how
many
do
you
suppose
there
are
in
memphis?
justice

r.

apparently
they
don't
even
need
outside
lawyers,
do
they?

what
happens
to
the
difficulties
of
proof
argument
where
the
state
is
involved.
justice
byron

white
why
shouldn't
it
bar
the
state
from
suing
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
should
be...
you
should
be
quicker
to
excuse
the
state
in
making
a
mistake?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
argument
is
that
there's
a
great
possibility
of
making
a
mistake
after
a
period
of
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
isn't
that
the
argument
against
the
mother?
this
is
liable
to
be
an
unreliable
proceeding
if
you
take
too
long
to
bring
the
suit.
justice
byron

white
and
yet
that
doesn't
bar
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
make
all
the
mistakes
you
want
to,
but
if
the
mistakes...
the
chance
that
the
mistake
is
really
existent,
the
state
can
nevertheless
override
it.
