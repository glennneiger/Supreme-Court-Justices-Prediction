mr.
horne,
why
did
the
mother
wait
so
long
in
this
case
to
bring
her
suit?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
who
bears
that
expense
in
tennessee?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
the
expense
very
substantial
in
your
state?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
isn't
that
a
little
out
of
line
with
the
general
expense
over
the
country?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
is
this
lab?
in
memphis?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
sound
like
you
have
a
little
state
parochialism
in
tennessee,
isn't
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
other
words,
the
state
has
the
statute
of
limitations,
the
period
of
limitations
nine
times
longer
than
the
mother
has.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
the
mother...
even
though
the
child
is
dependant
on
the
mother
for
support.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
in
the
mother's
case
however.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'm
just
drawing
the
parallel.
if
the
mother
is
supporting
the
child
exclusively,
she
has
two
years.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
the
state
has
nine
times
the
length
of
time.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
that's
fair?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let's
see
if
i
understand
this.
from
what
you've
just
said,
the
tennessee
statute
is
more
restrictive
than
the
texas
statute
in
mills.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
in
this
respect,
the
child
can't
bring
its
own
action.
in
texas
it
could.
and
the
mother's
posture
sometimes
can
be
in
conflict
with
the
child's.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
if
she
may
have
a
crush
on
the
father
and
doesn't
anticipate
he's
going
to
be
a
good
boy
after
all
and
when
he
grows
up
he'll
take
care
of
the
child
and
just
not
bring
the
action?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
repeat
my
observation.
i
think
your
statute,
in
this
respect,
is
more
restrictive
than
texas.
