marshall
mr.
elrod,
in
the
bivens
case,
following
up
on
the
chief
justice's
question,
there
was
no
other
remedy
available
to
bivens,
was
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
realize
that
my
next
question
is
going
to
be
that
this
one
wasn't
remedyless?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
had
a
remedy
in
your
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
say
this
is
a
bivens
case?
the
bivens
case
didn't
have
but
one
remedy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
case
has
two
remedies.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
do
you
say
it's
a
bivens-type
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
relying
on
another
case,
not
bivens.
