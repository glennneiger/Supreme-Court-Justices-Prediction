mr.

justice
sandra
day

i
suppose
it's
your
position
on
behalf
of
mr.
bush
that
what
was
lacking
here
was
a
right
to
obtain
compensatory
damages
for
embarrassment
or
anxiety
resulting
from
the
demotion,
and
the
failure
to
have
a
means
of
getting
punitive
damages
and
attorney's
fees.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
those
are
the
elements
that
are
lacking
in
the
civil
service
remedies?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
it
your
position
then
that
denying
mr.
bush
the
right
to
get
those
elements
of
damages
violates
the
constitution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
it
violate
the
constitution--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to...
and
what
provision
of
the
constitution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
an
equal
protection
clause--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
elrod,
do
you
suppose
congress
could
expressly
adopt
remedies
saying
that
they
intended
to
provide
a
cause
of
action
here
that
would
be
a
substitute
for
bivens
but
a
cause
of
action
that
would
not
grant
punitive
damages
or
attorney's
fees?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
isn't
a
constitutional
requirement
thing
that
these
remedies
be
provided.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
congress
couldn't
provide
something
otherwise
even
if
it
expressly
intended
to
do
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
congress
could
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--expressly
limit
a
remedy
to
government
employees,
in
your
view,
under
the
constitution?
