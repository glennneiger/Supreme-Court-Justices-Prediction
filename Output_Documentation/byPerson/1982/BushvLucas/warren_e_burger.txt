mr.
elrod,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
had
he...
does
the
record
show
to
what
extent,
if
any,
he
had
passed
these
notions
and
ideas
and
his
recommendations
on
up
through
channels
before
he
went
public?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
position
necessarily
means,
i
take
it,
that
in
unlawful
discharges
or
demotions
or
failure
to
get
a
promotion
that
was
due,
the
civil
service
remedy
enacted
by
congress
is
not
the
exclusive
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
bivens
had
nothing
to
do
with
an
employee
of
the
government,
did
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
bivens
remedy,
as
defined
in
the
bivens
case,
was
not
a
remedy
for
government
employees,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
citizen...
a
citizen
who
was
not
an
employee,
however.
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
might...
the
government
employee
might,
as
justice
rehnquist
suggests,
have
a
bivens-type
claim
in
some
circumstances.
the
question
is
whether
he
has
a
bivens-type
claim
arising
out
of
government
conduct
or
alleged
government
conduct
for
which
other
remedies
have
been
provided.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--now,
did
he
recover
some
$30,000
in
back
pay
before
he
was
reinstated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
amounted
to
some
$30,000?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
theory,
is
it
not
true
that
a
great,
great
number
of
employee
discharges
or
failures
to
get
promotions
or
tenure
or
whatever
in
government
might
well
be
open
to
both
the
civil
service
remedy
and
the
remedy
that
you
are
seeking
here?
that
is,
in
many,
many
cases,
the
allegations...
in
27
years
i
have
seen
hundreds
of
them
now
in
the
federal
courts...
many,
many
cases
the
allegation
is
that
the
boss
was
biased,
that
the
hearing
board
was
not
impartial,
that
somebody
was
out
to
get
him
and
that
sort
of
thing.
all
those
would
add
up
to
a
bivens
tort
claim,
at
least,
too,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
1883,
if
that
was
the
year
when
congress
created
what
we
now
call
the
civil
service
system,
was
not
the
purpose
of
providing
a
remedy
that
would
be
inexpensive
and
fair
and
not
put
him...
put
the
employee
to
going
into
the
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
prior
to
that...
prior
to
that
there
was
no
real
remedy
at
all,
was
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
geller.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
elrod?
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
