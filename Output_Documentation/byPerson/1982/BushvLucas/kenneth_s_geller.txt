mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fundamental
flaw
in
petitioner's
position
is
that
it
starts
from
the
erroneous
premise
that
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
based
on
an
alleged
constitutional
violation
is
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
constitutional
right
itself.
based
on
this
faulty
assumption
which
confuses
rights
and
remedies,
petitioner
asks
as
he
did
a
moment
ago
why
should
federal
employees
be
deprived
of
this
right
when
state
employees,
for
example,
in
a
comparable
situation
would
be
able
to
bring
a
personal
damages
action
in
federal
court.
and
the
answer
is
an
obvious
but
nonetheless
extremely
important
one.
state
employees
can
bring
suit
because
congress
in
section
1983
has
expressly
legislated
a
cause
of
action
for
damages.
now,
congress
has
not
done
so
with
respect
to
federal
employees
such
as
petitioner.
instead,
congress
has
set
up
an
elaborate
and
comprehensive
administrative
mechanism,
followed
by
judicial
review,
as
a
means
of
remedying
adverse
personnel
decisions
in
federal
employment,
including
personnel
decisions
alleged
to
be
based
on
some
unconstitutional
motivation.
now,
this
administrative
scheme
can
provide
adequate
make-whole
relief,
and
it
represents
the
product
of
literally
a
century's
worth
of
careful
balancing
of
the
rights
of
federal
employees
and
the
demands
of
the
federal
employment
relationship.
and
we
submit
that
it
would
be
an
unwarranted
intrusion
into
an
area
plainly
reserved
to
congress
if
this
court
were
to
create
an
additional
damages
remedy
superimposed
on
top
of
the
remedy
congress
has
provided,
absent
any
statutory
authority
to
do
so.
now,
this
case
is,
of
course,
merely
the
latest
in
a
series
of
constitutional
damages
actions
that
this
court
has
considered
in
the
dozen
years
since
bivens
was
decided.
but
it's
important
to
realize
at
the
outset
that
this
case
is
fundamentally
different
from
any
of
the
prior
cases.
this
case
is
unlike
bivens
itself
because
in
bivens
congress
hadn't
addressed
the
remedial
question
at
all.
the
argument
made
in
bivens
was
that
the
claimant
in
that
case
should
be
relegated
to
his
remedies
under
state
tort
law.
and
this
case
is
also
unlike
davis
against
passman
because
in
davis
the
claimant
was
expressly
included...
excluded
by
congress
from
a
comprehensive
statutory
remedial
scheme
and
would
have
been
left
entirely
remedyless
absent
the
bivens
action.
finally,
it
is
unlike
carlson
against
green
because
in
carlson
congress
had
set
up
a
judicial
remedy
that
was
not
designed
with
constitutional
violations
in
mind
and
was
plainly
intended
to
serve
as
a
complement
to
rather
than
as
a
replacement
for
a
bivens
remedy.
now,
in
each
of
these
cases,
before
allowing
a
bivens
remedy,
the
court
ensured
that
congress
either
had
not
addressed
the
question
of
what
remedy
to
provide
or
had
addressed
it
in
a
way
that
was
not
intended
to
occupy
the
field.
the
court,
in
effect,
was
legislating
interstitially.
it
was
carrying
out
congress'
intent
by
providing
a
remedy
in
a
case
properly
within
its
jurisdiction,
but
in
a
way
that
didn't
frustrate
congress'
primary
lawmaking
power.
now,
the
question
here
is
very
different.
congress
has
provided
an
express
statutory
remedy.
that
remedy
is
in
the
civil
service
laws.
and
it's
expressly
designed
to
deal
with,
among
other
things,
constitutional
violations
of
the
kind
alleged
by
petitioner
here.
and
congress
has
done
so
in
a
comprehensive
way
that
really
leaves
very
little
doubt
that
that
remedy
is
intended
to
be
exclusive.
we
believe
that
congress'
intent
should
be
followed
here
as
well
as
it
was
in
bivens,
davis,
and
carlson.
now,
the
court
has
organized
uniquely
into
congress'
intent
in
the
past
by
essentially
asking
two
questions:
first,
does
there
exist
another
federal
remedy
equally
effective
in
the
view
of
congress?
second,
if
there
is
no
other
available
remedy,
are
there
nonetheless
special
factors
counseling
hesitation
such
that
congress
couldn't
have
intended
the
courts
to
intrude
into
a
particular
area
simply
based
on
the
power
of
the
jurisdictional
ground?
and
we
believe
that
both
questions
lead
to
the
answer
given
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
the...
on
the
second
ground,
the
counseling
hesitation,
although
in
the
course
of
it
it
described
the
very
comprehensive
civil
service
remedies
that...
that
the...
that
federal
employees
have...
have
available
to
it.
i
think
the
court
might
have
done
that
on
remand
after
this
court
decided
carlson
against
green
because
there
was
a
statement
in
carlson
about
requiring
an
explicit
statement
by
congress.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
they
didn't
in
those
terms,
justice
white,
but
both
questions
are
really
designed
to
answer
the
same
question,
which
is:
what
is
the
intent
of
congress?
did
congress
intend
the
courts
to--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
rely
on
both
grounds
here,
although
we
think
that
the...
the
way
to
analyze
this
case
is
to
look
and
see
as
the
court
did
in
bivens
and
davis
and
in
carlson
whether
there
was
some
other
adequate
remedy
available
to
the
claimant,
and
if
there
is,
and
if
congress
intended
that
remedy
to
be
exclusive,
that's
really
the
end
of
the
judicial
inquiry.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
absolutely,
yes.
we
argue--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
we
argue
both,
we
argue
both
of
these
points
below.
and
as
i
say,
there
are
really
separate
ways
of
answering
the
same
question,
which
is:
what
was
congress'
intent?
let
me
say
that
this
is
at
bottom
just
a
federal
employment
dispute.
petitioner
was
given
a
two-job
grade
demotion
from
gs-14
to
gs-12
following
a
disagreement
with
officials
in
his
agency
about
internal
agency
practices.
now,
his
superiors
claim
he
was
demoted
for
publicly
making
false
and
misleading
statements
about
his
job
that
disrupted
his
agency's
activities
and
undermined
employee
morale.
and
petitioner
claims
on
the
other
hand
that
he
was
in
fact
demoted
simply
for
justifiably
criticizing
his
superiors.
this
is
the
sort
of
dispute
that
in
the
private
sector
would
be
resolved
internally
or
by
contract
or
arbitration
or
something
like
that.
and
in
the
federal
employment
sphere
as
well,
the
court
has
been
extremely
deferential
to
the
executive
branch
and
to
congress
in
settling
these
courts
of...
these
kinds
of
internal
employment
disagreements.
so
even
in
the
absence
of
any
guidance
by
congress,
we
think
that
this
is
an
area
that
counsels
hesitation
in
the
implication
of
a
bivens
remedy.
but
here
we
don't
have
congressional
silence
at
all.
what
we
have
is
an
extremely
elaborate,
comprehensive,
adequate
system
of
administrative
and
judicial
remedies
that
congress
has
set
up
precisely
to
deal
with
the
sort
of
question
that
is
raised
in
this
case.
aggrieved
employees
can
challenge
adverse
personnel
actions,
and
including
personnel
actions
claimed
to
violate
their
constitutional
rights.
they
can
pursue...
pursue
those
remedies
through
two
layers
of
administrative
review,
followed
by
judicial
review.
and
if
they
eventually
prevail,
they
are
entitled
to
complete
make-whole
relief.
they
can
get
back
pay,
as
mr.
bush
did,
reinstatement,
restoration
of
all
employment
benefits,
correction
of
any
personnel
records.
the
congress
clearly
thought
when
it
was
passing
the
back
pay
act,
it
was
passing
complete
perfecting
legislation
to
make
the
employee
whole.
and
this
court
said
much
the
same
thing
in
samson
against
murray
and
arnett
against
kennedy.
in
fact,
it's
quite
peculiar
in
a
sense
that
the
petitioners
would
argue
that
a
bivens
action
is
more
effective
than...
than
what
congress
has
already
provided
for
someone
who
claims...
whose
claim
is
based...
basically
an
employment
dispute.
someone
who
claims
he
was
demoted
or
fired,
it
would
seem
that
any
remedy
that
didn't
include
something
like
reinstatement
would
be
ineffective.
and
yet
we're
told
here
today
that
the
only
effective
remedy
is
a
constitutional
damages
action.
indeed,
petitioner
pursued
these
very
remedies
and,
i
said...
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
received
reinstatement,
back
pay,
and
restoration
of
all
benefits.
now,
we
submit
that
when
congress
has
spoken
as
clearly
as
it
has
here,
there
is
simply
no
room
left
for
the
court
to
legislate
interstitially.
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
to
create
a
damages
remedy
to
vindicate
constitutional
rights,
because
congress
has
already
announced
the
remedy
it
believes
should
be
applied
in
that
situation.
and
that
remedy
is
plainly
an
adequate
one.
if
the
court's
statement
in
bivens,
carlson
and
davis
about
congress'
ability
to
substitute
for
a
bivens
remedy
with
something
that
it
believes
to
be
equally
effective
means
anything,
it
has
to
mean
that
congress
can
do
what
it
did
in
this
case
in
the
case
of
federal
employees.
and
i
think
what
the
court
meant
in
carlson
when
it
talked
about
an
explicit
statement,
requiring
explicit
statement
by
congress,
i
don't
think
the
court
meant
anything
more
than
congress
had
to
be
legislating
with
the
constitution
in
mind,
unlike,
for
example,
in
carlson
against
green,
where
the
claim
was
that
a
tort
claim
remedy
was
a
substitute
for
a
bivens
action
even
though
congress
in
passing
that
tort
claims
remedy
certainly
wasn't
legislating
with
the
constitution
in
mind.
in
fact,
it
wasn't
even
enough
under
the
tort
claims
remedy
to
prove
a
constitutional
violation,
the
plaintiff
had
to
mold
his
claim
into
the
form
of
a
common
law
tort
in
order
to
recover.
but
here
the
civil
service
remedies
are
clearly
addressed
to,
among
other
things,
constitutional
violations.
in
fact,
as
we
point
out,
one
of
the
early
civil
service
laws,
the
lloyd
and
fallon
act,
was
passed
to
prevent
the
sort,
the
same
sort
of
adverse
personnel
actions
that
petitioner
bush
claims
he
suffered
in
this
case,
where
congress
was
concerned
that
presidents
taft
and
roosevelt
had
issued
gag
orders
preventing
executive
branch
employees
from...
from
complaining
to
congress
about
abuse
or
mismanagement
in
the
federal
government.
so
we
think
that
what
congress
has
done
here
is
in...
it
is
to
pass
a
remedy
that
certainly
in
its
view,
and
the
court
said
in
carlson
against
green
that
it
has
to
be
equally
effective
in
the
view
of
congress,
not
in
the
view
of
plaintiffs
or
even
in
the
view
of
this
court.
and
we
think
that
that
is
what
they
have
done
here
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
therefore
properly
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
petitioner's
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action
directly
under
the
constitution.
and
we
would
ask
that
that
judgment
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
