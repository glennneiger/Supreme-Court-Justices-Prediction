mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
in
this
case
filed
a
complaint
containing
a
bivens-type
complaint
in
a
state
court.
the
respondent,
who
like
the
petitioner
is
a
civilian
employee
of
the
federal
government,
obtained
the
removal
of
the
case
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
alabama.
from
that
point
forward,
the
government,
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
appears
to
have
been
cast
in
the
role
of
defendant.
i
say
appears
to
have
been
cast
in
the
role
of
defendant.
we
are
not
suing
the
government.
the
petitioner's
bivens-type
claim
was
that
the
respondent
had
violated
the
petitioner's
first
amendment
rights
by
participating
as
chief
conspirator,
if
not
principal
procurer
in
the
concocting
and
consummating
of
the
petitioner's
demotion
under
color
of
federal
law
and
by
virtue
of
the
positions
which
the
conspirators
held.
the
avowed
intent
and
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
is
to
punish
the
petitioner,
to
strike
back,
to
retaliate,
to
pervert
official
power
from
its
proper
purpose
for
having
publicly
observed
and
spoken
up
about
what
he
perceived
to
be
rampant
waste
at
george
f.
marshall
space
flight
center
in
north
alabama.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
the
record
reflects
in
a
truncated
fashion,
since
this
comes
up
from
summary
judgment,
the
record
reflects
that
the
petitioner
made
some
efforts
within
the
organization
through
his
representative
in
the
manpower
office
to
obtain
some
alleviation
as
to
his
personal
problem.
and
at...
as
he
observed
that
he
was
not
alone
in
being
misclassified
or
a
round...
or
a
square
peg
in
a
round
hole,
it
ate
on
him.
and
he
went
public.
after
a
series
of
proceedings,
administrative
proceedings,
mr.
bush's
having
gone
public
eventually
was
perceived
to
be
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
i
understand
that
the
government
from
its--
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
--by
the
what
was
then
called
the
appeals
review
board
of
what
was
then
called
the
civil
service
commission.
that
happened
in
mid-passage.
this
lawsuit,
the
bivens
claim
and
all,
was
already
pending,
not
before
the
administrative
proceedings
had
begun
but
they
were
pending
concurrently
because
an
alabama
statute
of
limitations
would,
in
my
judgment,
possibly
have
cut
off
one
of
the
claims
that
is
not
present
before
the
court
had
the
suit
not
been
filed
when
it
was
filed.
i
say
not
present
before
the
court,
it's
not
included
within
the
petition.
it's
in
the
record.
as
i
understand
the
government's
brief
in
this
case,
the
government
concedes
what
it
candidly
describes
as
petitioner's
well...
the
well-established
constitutional
right
which
the
petitioner
asserts.
what
the
government
disputes
is
the
petitioner's
right...
or
is
whether
the
petitioner
has
a
bivens-type
remedy
for
the
impairment
of
that
right.
in
effect,
the
government
currently,
in
defense
of
an
opinion
rendered
on
remand
by
a
court
of
appeals,
currently
espouses
the
second
branch
of
the
carlson
against
green
formulation
as
to
whether
an
alternative
remedy
or
as
to
whether
there
is
a
basis
for
barring
or
defeating
at
the
threshold
a
bivens-type
claim.
and
that
second
ground,
of
course,
is
that
congress
had
manifested
its
intent.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
an
area
of
semantics,
but
it
specifically...
explicitly
states,
but
i
will
say
clearly
manifests
its
intent
that
an
alternative
remedy
which
it
has
adopted
is
intended
as
a
substitute
for
a
bivens-type
action
and
is
viewed
by
congress--
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
in
damage
terms--
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
--it
is--
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
--it
is
my
position
that
it
would,
although
i
am
speaking
to
a
judicial
tribunal,
that
it
would
be
an
invidious
kind
of
distinction.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
yes,
ma'am,
i
think
it
would.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
i
did
not...
it
would...
it
would,
in
my
judgment,
and
i
realize
that
i
am
venturing
where
in...
rushing
in
where
some
people
fear
to
tread...
in
my
judgment,
a
decision
that
the
denial
of
the
dignitary
elements
of
a
government
employee's
claim
in
a
bivens-type
suit
otherwise
well
grounded,
assuming
that,
of
course,
as
we
will
upon
summary
judgment,
that
denying
him
that
would
be
denying
a
discrete
isolated
group
of
people
the
same
protection
of
the
law
that
the
citizenry
at
large
has.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
access
of
courts--
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
--whether
it
be
viewed
as
part
of
equal
protection
or
as
an
extension
of
freedom
of
expression.
prisoners
have
access
to
court.
aliens
have
access
to
court
on
bivens-type
claims.
only,
apparently,
government
employees,
if
the
lower
court
is
correct,
so
far
as
a
class,
as
a
discrete
class,
those
who
have
had
the
benefits
of
civil
service
remedies
which
come
down
on
the
bottom
line
to
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
yes,
sir,
he
would,
and
he
would
not
be
covered
by
any
civil
service
act
that
i
know
of.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
that
act...
that
argument
has
certainly
served
as
plausibility.
i
am
not
sure
that
it
applies
in
this
case.
i
am
sure
that
there...
that
the
government
as
employer
has
been
interested
in
civilian
employees
since
even
before
the
adoption
of
the
pendleton
act.
i
think
the
government
does
have
other
interests
as
an
employer
than
it
has...
from
those
that
it
has
in
some
other
capacity.
i
suggest
to
this
court...
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
civil
service
remedies
which
the
government
postulates
here
as
a
bar
to
the
maintenance
of
a
bivens
suit
in
the
premises
of
this
case
do
not
meet
the
test
standard
prescribed
by
this
court
in
carlson
against
green,
for
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
among
other
things,
they
afford
no
recompense
whatever
with
respect
to
the
dignitary
elements
of
the
petitioner's
claim.
and
we
consider
that
interest
in
personality,
how
it
is
shielded
by
the
bill
of
rights.
and
we
would
consider
the
policy
often
enunciated
by
this
court,
a
policy
of
maximizing
the
vindication
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
it
is
unless
it's
constitutional
deprivation
bar.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
unless
the
promotion...
the
adverse
action,
as
they
used
to
call
it,
i
think
we
call
it
unwarranted
or
unjustified
now...
unless
the
adverse
action
is
unconstitutional,
the
bivens...
there
is
no
bivens
remedy,
of
course.
the
administrative
remedies
are
excluded.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
as...
in
the
bivens
case
it
was
a
remedy
for
webster
bivens,
who
as
the
court
perceived,
or
a
majority
of
the
court,
no
other
remedy
that
was
made.
in
carlson
against
green,
which
expanded
bivens,
as
i
perceive
it,
it
was
stated
that
bivens
established
that
a
citizen,
the
victim
of
an
unconstitutional...
of
unconstitutional
deprivation
had
a
right
of
action,
sounding
and
damages...
i
am
paraphrasing,
of
course...
against--
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
--so
far
as
i
know,
this
is
the...
the
first
employee
case
to
reach
this
court
with
a...
where
a
government
employee
was
asserting
a
bivens-type
claim.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
well,
with
some
deference,
i
suggest
that
i
have
failed
adequately
to
state
what
we
are
complaining
about.
your
perception
probably
is
absolutely
accurate
on
the
basis
of
what
i
have
said.
i
want
to
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
what
we
complain
of
is
something
that
took
place
before
the
wheels
of
the
governmental
machinery
were
engaged.
it
is
a
tort
antecedent
to
the
engagement
of
the
wheels
of
that
machinery.
it
is
a
tort
by
one
in
place
of
power
where
the
other...
in
a
place
where
the...
the
tortfeasors
entering
into
the
conspiracy
would
otherwise
not
have
any
meaning
unless
he
were
in
that
place
of
power.
we
are
not
complaining
about
the
personnel
action
as
qua
personnel
action.
we
are
complaining
about
a
tort
by
doctor
or
mr.
lucas
in
concocting
and
arranging
and
procuring
what
amounts
by...
by
analogy
to
the
malicious
prosecution
of
administrative
proceedings.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
there...
arguably,
the
new
york
remedy
as
tort
law
remedies
were
rather
meaningless,
and
of
course,
the--
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
--he
had...
he
had--
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
--he
had
a
remedy.
he
had
a
partial
remedy
just
as--
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
--well,
in
carlson--
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
--in
carlson,
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
carlson
against
green,
the
first
issue
assumed
that
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
would
support
an
action
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
notwithstanding
that,
this
court
held
that
the
remedies
were
cumulative
and
parallel
and
that
the,
as
i...
as
i
perceive
green,
the
ruling,
and
that
the
ftca
claim
or
remedy
did
not
bar
a
bivens
remedy.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
because
it's
directly
under
the
constitution--
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
--well,
bivens
is
an
extension
of
carlson.
it's
a
bivens
type.
we
would
speak
of
clifford
trust
and
totten
trust
and
so
forth.
it's
taken
on
a
generic
secondary
meaning.
an
action
brought
directly
under
the
constitution
without
intervening
enactment
by
congress
authorizing
the
federal
courts
to
entertain
such
an
action.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
eminently
so,
sir.
as
a
practical
matter,
i
do
not
know
why
anybody
other
than
a
pioneer
would
start
a
bivens-type
suit,
a
crusader,
a
pioneer,
or
a
don
quixote.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
at
the
time
of
his
reinstatement
under
the
back
pay
act,
as
amended,
he
received
full
pay.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
some
$30,000.
it's
not
in
this
record,
but
it
had
to
be
true.
upon
which
he
paid
taxes
and
upon
which
his
insurance
was
deducted.
he
has...
his
economic
losses,
while
they
embrace
the
matter
of
attorney's
fees
and
of
lost
leave
time,
they
are
not
of
great
moment
in
this
case.
the
dignitary
elements
are:
the
right
of
the
individual
to...
to
be
free
from
this
type
of
tyrannical
action
by
a
middle-level
martinet.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
on
paper.
particularly
since
harlow
against
nixon...
or
rather
fitzgerald
against
harlow,
i
should
think
that
they
would
be
rather
easily
disposed
of,
if
not
on
motion
to
dismiss,
then
by...
on
motion
for
summary
judgment
interposed
by
a
government
lawyer
at
no
expense
to
the
defendant.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
i
don't
read
anything
in
the
pendleton
act
that
has
anything
to
do
with
remedies.
i
may
have
misread
it.
it
created
a
merit
system,
partially
eliminated
the
spoils
system,
said
that
people
who
habitually
used
too
much
alcohol
couldn't
be
employees,
and
created
a
civil
service
commission.
and
then
over
the
course
of
time
we
have
the
housekeeping
details
gradually
developing
until
we
have
some
remedies
coming
in
with
more
to
follow.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
initially,
it
was
hard
to
tort,
insofar
as...
in
remedial
terms.
the
government
in
this
case,
i
don't
believe,
will
make
or
has
made
any
serious
pretense
of
demonstrating
that
congress
explicitly
has
provided
an
alternative
remedy.
i
said
this
was
an
alternative
for
a
bivens-type
remedy,
in
effect.
i
do
not
read
the
several
successive
civil
service
statutes
to
which
the
government
refers
as
occupying
the
field
or
as
advancing
an
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
preclude
this
court
from
inferring
remedies.
bivens
was
decided
in
1971.
congress
has
been
in
session
several
times
since
then.
in
1974
it
adopted
the...
amended
the
federal
tort
claims
act
by
creating
a
remedy
which
it
explicitly
stated
to
be
parallel...
i
suppose
i
could
i
get
into
the
quagmire
of
the
legislative
history...
for
which
there
is
some
data
to
support
the
conclusion
that
it
conceived
it
was
creating
a
parallel
remedy.
in
1978,
which...
in
an
act
which
take
effect...
took
effect
after
the
effective
date
of
mr.
bush's
reinstatement,
congress
undertook
to
enact
whistle-blower
protection
legislation.
it
did
not
in
terms
exclude
bivens,
nor
do
i...
i
submit
did
it
manifest
an
intent
to
occupy
the
field.
but
congress
has
left
bivens
in
place
for
whatever
the
claimant.
now,
we
have
then
a
civil
servant
who
either
has
or
doesn't
have
the...
is
entitled
or
is
not
entitled
to
the
same
measure
of
recovery
for
the
same
wrong
as
the
citizenry
at
large.
if
he's
not...
i
frankly
do
not
perceive
a
viable
reason
why
he
shouldn't
be...
but
if
he's
not,
we
all
need
to
know
it.
the...
we
have
a
civil
servant
who
is
either
entitled
to
full
recovery...
in
full
recovery
against
the
federal
functionary
as
he
would
be
against
a
state
functionary
under
1983
28...
42
u.s.c.
in
1983,
the
civil
service
act.
there
is
no
question
that
recovery
could
be
had,
that
they
could
carry
out
under
the
civil
rights
act
or
under
the
common
law
analogues
of
malicious
prosecution.
this
alternative,
this
postulated
remedy
does
not
make
mr.
bush
whole,
it
does
not
deter
like-minded
bureaucrats
from
doing
by
some
other
means
what
we
aver
that
dr.
lucas
did
in
this
case.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
i
have
to--
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
--it's
a
constitutional
requirement
that
all
litigant
assemblies
situated
receive
similar
treatment.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
it
could
limit
it
to
government
employees,
in
my
judgment.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
without
some
demonstration--
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
--not...
and
not
in
view
of
the
careful
treatment
which
this
court
has
given
similar
problems
in
such
cases
as
csc
against
letter
carriers
and
in
bmw
against
mitchell
where
it
has
searched
and
strained
and
required
experiential
empirical
data
to
justify
the
restriction.
mr.
william
harvey
elrod,
jr.
may
i
submit
to
the
court
a
close
and
careful
collation
of
the
legislative
materials
which
the
government
itself
cites
in
this
case
will
not
disclose
that
congress
has
ever
done
more
in
the
area
of
remedies
for
the
type
of
grievance
that
mr.
bush
has
than
it
did
for
the
type
of
grievance
that
mrs.
green
had
in
carlson
against
green.
i
submit
that
it
is
erroneous
to
say
that
we
complain
of
a
personnel
action.
we
complain
of
the
procuring
of
this
personnel
action
which
resulted
in
our
being
punished
for
having
exercised
a
constitutionally
protected
freedom.
