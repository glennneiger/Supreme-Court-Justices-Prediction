mr.
ruben
nazario
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
not
whether
the
secretary
has
the
authority
to
promulgate
regulations
to
determine
disability.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
secretary's
failure
to
give
an
unrepresented
and
uneducated
claimant
notice
of
the
medical
and
vocational
factors
which
he
has
to
determine
prior
to
applying
the
grid
violated
the
claimant's
procedural
rights
to
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
mr.
ruben
nazario
first
of
all,
your
honor,
the
claimant
has
the
right
under
the
regulations
to
present
all
the
evidence
relevant
to
her
case.
the
claimant
has
the
right
under
the
statute
to
present
all
her
relevant
evidence
and
the
statute
imposes
on
the
secretary
the
requirement
that
he
base
his
decisions
on
evidence
adduced
at
the
hearing.
but
more
importantly,
this
right
is
premised
on
the
secretary's
own
regulations
which
require
the
alj,
especially
where
the
claimant
is
not
represented,
to
help
the
claimant
present
her
case
to--
mr.
ruben
nazario
--no,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
just
made
reference
to
the...
in
general
to
the
claimant's
right
to
present
evidence
at
the
hearing.
precisely
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
the
claimant
was
not
given
the
chance
to
present
the
relevant
evidence
in
this
case.
they
did
not
cite
the
authority
for
the
holding,
but
the
holding
is
clearly
that
the
claimant
did
not
have
the
right
to
present
her
case
because
the
secretary
failed
to
give
her
notice
of
the
issues.
the
second
circuit
clearly
did
not
evaluate
the
medical
and
vocational
regulations.
all
the
circuit
did
was
a
factual
determination
that
mrs.
campbell
did
not
have
this
fair
opportunity
to
present
this
case
which
is
given
to
her
by
the
statute,
and
which
the
secretary--
mr.
ruben
nazario
--i
believe
the
specific
regulation
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
it
is
cited
also
in
the
secretary's
brief.
it
is
the
regulation
which
imposes
on
the
secretary,
or
rather
on
the
alj
the
duty
to
look
fully
into
all
the
matters
at
issue
in
order
to
take
the
testimony
of
the
claimant,
to
make
the
relevant
questions
to
the
claimant.
this
regulation
has
been
interpreted
by
most
courts--
mr.
ruben
nazario
--yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
0....
mr.
ruben
nazario
the
regulation
appears
at
30
cfr
44.944.
mr.
ruben
nazario
we
discuss
that
regulation
on
page
11
of
our
brief,
the
second
paragraph
there.
the
case
law,
in
fact,
imposes
on
an
alj
a
duty
to
go
beyond
the
classic
prehearing
notice.
it
imposes
on
the
alj
the
duty
to
make
sure
that
the
claimant
present
all
the
relevant
evidence
in
disability
hearings.
it
was
precisely
this
opportunity
which
was
denied
to
mrs.
campbell.
the
secretary,
through
mr.
garvey,
has
emphasized
to
this
court
that
the
medical
and
vocational
regulations
should
not
come
into
play
until
the
claimant
has
had
a
full
opportunity
to
testify
about
the
issues
which
they
leave
open
for
litigation.
mr.
ruben
nazario
i
say--
mr.
ruben
nazario
--yes,
your
honor.
the
case
is
premised
on
a
violation
of
the
secretary's
regulation.
mr.
ruben
nazario
the
constitutional...
the
right
of
a
claimant
to
testify
at
the
hearing
is
premised
not
only
in
the
secretary's
regulation,
but
also
in
the
social
security
statute
which
requires
notice
and
the
right--
mr.
ruben
nazario
--the
regulation,
and
also
a
constitutional
claim
because
the
claimant
has
a
right
under
the
fifth
amendment,
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
introduce
all
the...
to
have
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
determining
her
entitlement
to
disability
benefits.
mr.
ruben
nazario
that
is
not
the
issue
in
the
case,
your
honor.
the
issue
is
whether
the
secretary
complied
with
all
the
due
process
requirements
of
notice
and
of
full
and
fair
hearing
to
this
specific
claimant.
mr.
ruben
nazario
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ruben
nazario
well,
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
mrs.
campbell
had
had
due
process.
they
didn't--
mr.
ruben
nazario
--we
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
mrs.
campbell
had
not
been
given
adequate
notice
and
an
adequate
hearing
and
an
adequate
opportunity
to
present
her
evidence
because
the
alj
failed
to
inform
her
of
the--
mr.
ruben
nazario
--no,
your
honor,
we
did
not,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
take
it
in
terms
of
a
constitutional
violation.
it
assumed,
without
discussion,
that
mrs.
campbell
was
entitled
to
a
hearing,
to
a
full
opportunity
to
present
her
evidence.
but
there
is
no
discussion
of
the
statutory
or
constitutional
basis
for
this
requirement,
maybe
because
it
is
so
clear.
the
facts
in
the
record
of
mrs.
campbell
clearly
demonstrate
that
she
did
not
have
the
minimum
pre-notice
which
is
required
by
the
law.
mrs.
campbell,
as
has
been
stated,
has
only
a
sixth-grade
education.
she
has
some
difficulties
expressing
herself
in
english,
and
she
was
misled
by
the
secretary's
original
denial
of
benefits.
the
secretary
stated
that
she
was
not
entitled
to
benefits
because
she
could
return
to
her
usual
occupation
as
a
maid.
mrs.
campbell
came
to
the
hearing
prepared
to
discuss
that
issue,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
she
spent
most
of
her
efforts
at
her
hearing
testifying
to
why
she
could
not
perform
the
duties
required
by
her
former
occupations.
at
no
time
did
the
secretary
tell
mrs.
campbell
that
he
was
going
to
deny
benefits
based
on
the
rule
which
required
the
finding
that
she
could
lift
over
15
or
over
20
pounds
and
that,
therefore,
she
should
address
that
issue
at
the
hearing.
mrs.
campbell
presented
the
secretary
with
several
letters
from
her
doctor
which
stated
that
she
could
not
perform...
that
she
could
not
lift
any
weight.
the
secretary
or
the
alj
never
made
any
effort
to
ascertain
what
that
said
and
meant
by
heavy
work.
of
course,
this
finding
about
the
specific
number
of
pounds
which
mrs.
campbell
could
lift
was
critical.
if
she
had
been
found
unable
to
lift
over
ten
pounds,
she
would
have
established
that
she
was
disabled
under
the
act.
she
was
never
given
the
opportunity
to
present
this
evidence
to
the
secretary.
mr.
ruben
nazario
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
ruben
nazario
in
mrs.
campbell's
case,
we
believe
so.
if
the
alj
had
told
her
examples
of
the
jobs
which
she
was
assuming--
mr.
ruben
nazario
--under
this
process,
mrs.
campbell
would
have
probably
been
able
to
address
the
issue
at
the
hearing.
mr.
ruben
nazario
in
the
case
of
some
claimants
it
probably
would
have,
but
not
in
the
case
of
this
claimant.
mr.
ruben
nazario
i
don't
think
that
this
claimant
would
have
been
able
to
understand
the
secretary's
regulations.
frankly,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
mrs.
campbell
was
told
that
she
had
the
right,
or
that
she
had
the
obligation,
or
that
she
should--
mr.
ruben
nazario
--your
honor,
but
the
problem
is
that
the
regulations
do
not
contain
a
list
of
the
jobs,
and
that's
the
problem.
in
order
to
find
out
what
jobs
the
secretary
is
assuming
that
a
claimant
who
fits
a
grid
structure
can
perform,
the
claimant
would
have
to
go
to
other
more
difficult
and
less
available
sources,
such
as
the
dictionary
for
occupational
titles,
and
several
publications
of
several
agencies.
so
even
if
the
claimant
is
told
that
her
claim
will
be
decided
under
the
medical
and
vocational
regulations,
and
that
she
should
read
those
regulations,
assuming
that
the
claimant
can't
understand
the
regulations
and
can't
travel
to
the
district
office,
the
claimant
would
not
know
what
jobs
the
secretary
is
assuming
that
she
or
he
can
perform.
your
honor
was
absolutely
right
earlier
in
this
argument
when
he
said
that
the
claimant
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
testify
about
those
factors
which
limit
the
grid
applicability,
and
the
secretary
stated
in
his
argument
that
grids
come
into
play
only
where
claimant
has
limitations
in
terms
of
his
or
her
ability
to
meet
strength
requirements.
they
do
not
come
into
play
if
the
claimant
has
a
significant
non-exertional
limitation.
if
the
claimant
has
significant
visual
or
auditory
problems,
problems
in
terms
of
environmental
conditions,
if
inability
to
tolerate
gases,
fumes,
anything,
any
limitation
that
is
not
measured
out
in
terms
of
strength
would
limit
the
application
of
the
grid
to
that
claimant.
in
this
case,
mrs.
campbell
was
not
told
that
she
had
to
testify
about
these
types
of
limitations
because
they
would
be
relevant
in
determining
whether
the
grid
was
applicable
to
her.
so
that
this
record,
even
less
the
evidence
which
was
necessary
for
a
determination
of
whether
the
grid
was
applicable
at
all,
the
determination
by
the
second
circuit
that
mrs.
campbell
did
not
have
an
meaningful
chance
to
present
her
evidence
because
the
secretary
had
not
given
her
notice,
i
think
is
entitled
to
affirmance.
it
is
a
factual
determination
that
is
amply
supported
in
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
ruben
nazario
she
is
currently
receiving
about
only
$250
a
month.
mr.
ruben
nazario
i
understand
she
tried
to
get
legal
assistance
but
she
was
unable
to
because
the
private
attorneys
which
she
contacted
charged
a
sum
which
was
too
high
for
her
means
at
that
time,
and
she
could
not
get
the
service
of
a
free
legal
representative.
the
secretary--
mr.
ruben
nazario
--no,
your
honor,
not
until
she
filed
the
case
in
the
district
court.
mr.
ruben
nazario
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ruben
nazario
that
was
a
private
attorney.
mr.
ruben
nazario
that
is
correct,
it
was
a
private
attorney.
the
secretary
argues
in
this
case
that
mrs.
campbell
had
notice
because,
first
of
all,
the
procedures
for
determining
disability
under
the
regulations
are
spelled
out
in
the
regulations,
and
he
claims
that
this
notice
by
regulation
meets
the
requirements
of
adequate
notice.
mr.
ruben
nazario
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
the
alj...
the
only
recourse
that
the
claimant
would
have
is
if
the
alj
fulfills
his
duties
under
the
regulations
and
makes
all
the
relevant
questions
at
the
hearing,
then
the
claimant
would
ideally
be
informed
of
what
the
issues
are,
but
certainly
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
mr.
ruben
nazario
i
believe
that
a
copy
of
the
cfr...
a
copy
of
the
regulations
would
be
made
available
to
the
claimant
if
the
claimant
goes
to
the
office
and
inquires
about
it.
mr.
ruben
nazario
that
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
that
i
do
not
know.
but
nothing
in
the
record
of
this
case
indicates
that
mrs.
campbell
was
advised
of
the
availability
of
those
regulations,
and
nothing
in
this
case
indicates
that
all
the
claimants
are
advised
of
the
availability
and
importance
of
those
regulations.
mr.
ruben
nazario
well,
your
honor,
in
this
case
i
think
she
did
as
much
as
she
could,
considering
that
she
had
a
sixth
grade
education,
that
she
was
unrepresented
at
her
hearing,
and
that
she
was
misled
by
the
secretary's
initial
denial
of
benefits.
mr.
ruben
nazario
she
did
went
to
the
district
office,
that's
where
she
filed
the
initial
claim
for
benefits,
that
is
where
she
filed
the
claim
for
reconsideration
of
the
original
denial,
and
that
is
where
she
filed
the
request
for
the
hearing.
but
when
she
filed
the
request
for
the
hearing,
she
wasn't
informed
of
the
availability
of
the
regulations.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that.
mr.
ruben
nazario
presumably
they
were
available,
but
she
was
not
informed
of
their
availability.
mr.
ruben
nazario
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
mr.
ruben
nazario
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
right.
but
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
again,
is
not
whether
the
secretary
has
the
authority
to
promulgate
this
regulation.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
regulations
were
properly
applied
to
mrs.
campbell.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
secretary
met
the
requirements
in
his
own
regulations,
where
the
secretary
fulfilled
his
obligation
to
make
sure
that
the
claimant
presented
all
the
relevant
evidence
which
is
required
prior
to
the
application
of
the
medical
and
vocational
regulations.
mr.
ruben
nazario
well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
state
that
in
so
many
words,
but
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
clear.
it
remanded
the
case
of
mrs.
campbell
to
the
secretary
for
consideration
of
her
claim
after
she
was
adequately
informed
of
what
the
issues
of
the
hearing
were.
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
clear
in
requiring
proper
application
of
the
medical
and
vocational
regulations.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
discuss
at
all
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
medical
and
vocational
regulations.
it
did
not
discuss
any
of
the
arguments
which
have
been
made
against
the
validity
of
the
medical
and
vocational
regulations.
it
limited
its
holding
to
a
factual
determination
that
mrs.
campbell
did
not
have
notice
and,
therefore,
she
was
unable
to
present
the
evidence
which
was
required.
mr.
ruben
nazario
well,
your
honor,
if
the
alj
had
followed
up
on
this
statement,
if
the
alj
had
made
the
statement
while
mrs.
campbell
was
testifying,
then
probably
mrs.
campbell
would
have
been
able
to
present
her
relevant
evidence.
but
this
statement
was
made
by
the
alj
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing
when
he
was
explaining
to
mrs.
campbell
all
the
relevant
procedures...
all
the
relevant
social
security
procedures.
he
explained
her
appeals
right.
he
explained
her
right
to
be
represented.
he
explained
her
right
to
object
to
the
medical
evidence
which
had
been
incorporated
in
the
record.
he
did
not
follow
up
on
this
statement
at
the
stage
of
the
hearing
where
mrs.
campbell
was
testifying
about
her
capacities.
in
fact,
if
you
look
further
down--
mr.
ruben
nazario
--if
he
had
repeated
this
statement
in
terms
of
questions,
and
if
mrs.
campbell
had
been
therefore
able
to
put
in
evidence
on
each
of
these
factors,
then
mrs.
campbell
would
have
established
that
she
was
disabled
under
the
grid
and,
of
course,
she
would
have
had
no
need
to
appeal
on
the
secretary's
decision.
if
you
look
at
the
record
of
the
transcript
where
mrs.
campbell
is
in
fact
testifying
about
her
capacities,
that
is
only
two
pages
in
the
transcript,
it
appears
on
page...
basically
on
page
50
and
the
first
half
of
page
51,
she,
for
example,
stated:
"i
cannot
sit
too
long.
"
"i
cannot
stand
too
long.
"
that
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
49.
instead
of
the
alj
asking
her,
how
long
can
you
sit?
how
many
pounds
can
you
lift?
because
that
was
critical
to
the
determination
of
her
claim,
the
alj
changed
the
line
of
her
testimony
by
asking
"can
you
bend"?
"i
cannot
bend.
"
"the
doctor
warned
me
not
to
lift
weights.
"
there
the
alj
again
changes
the
line
of
her
testimony
and
says,
"i
notice
that
you
have
stood
up
several
times.
"
further
down
the
page,
she
is
again
testifying
about
her
limitations,
and
she
is
saying:
"i
cannot
raise.
"
"i
can't
do
anything
too
much.
"
the
alj
instead
of
trying
to
elicit
her
testimony
with
any
specificity,
which
was
required
for
application
of
the
grid,
the
alj
again
changed
around
her
testimony
by
asking
about
her
medical
treatment.
this
record
clearly
establishes
that
mrs.
campbell
did
not
put
into
the
record
the
evidence
which
was
necessary
for
the
determination
of
her
claim
under
the
grid,
and
that
she
did
not
present
her
evidence
because
the
secretary
never
informed
her
of
what
it
was
that
she
needed
to
prove.
i
would
like
to
clarify
a
statement
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
has
been
relied
on
by
the
secretary
in
his
papers.
the
secretary
says
that
the
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
finding
that
mrs.
campbell
could
perform
light
work
is
very
important,
and
in
fact
shows
that
mrs.
campbell
was
in...
that
mrs.
campbell's
ability
to
work
was
properly
considered
by
the
secretary.
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
there
are
two
different
purposes
for
judicial
review
in
disability
determinations.
one
is
whether
the
secretary's
determination
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
the
other
one
is
whether
the
secretary
followed
proper
procedures
in
determining
the
claimant's
application
for
benefits.
by
saying
that
considering
whatever
evidence
was
already
in
the
record
of
mrs.
campbell's
proceeding,
the
determination
that
she
could
perform
light
work
may
have
found
some
support,
the
secretary
was
not
sanctioning
the
way
in
which
the
alj
arrived
at
that
determination.
on
several
occasions
the
second
circuit
has
remanded
cases
to
the
secretary
despite
finding
the
determinations,
the
specific
determination
supported
by
substantial
evidence
precisely
because
the
claimant
was
not
given
an
opportunity
to
introduce
contrary
evidence.
all
that
the
second
circuit
did
in
this
case
was
to
determine
factually
that
mrs.
campbell
did
not
have
notice
and
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
present
evidence.
that
determination
is
amply
supported
by
the
record
of
the
case,
and
should
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
furthermore,
the
determination...
the
direction
to
the
secretary
that
he
has
to
give
meaningful
and
informative
knowledge
to
mrs.
campbell
on
the
remanded
hearing
is
consistent
with
the
secretary's
own
regulations,
with
the
secretary's
own
argument,
and
should
also
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
i
thank
you
very
much.
