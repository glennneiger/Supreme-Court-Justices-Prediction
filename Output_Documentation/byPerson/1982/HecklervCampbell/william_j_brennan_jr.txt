justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
one
of
the
things
that
the
tables
say
is
that
light
work
includes
the
ability
to
lift
up
to
20
pounds
or
15,
whatever
it
is,
may
the
claimant
dispute
whether
or
not
he
or
she
in
fact
may
lift
up
to
15
pounds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what
happens,
mr.
garvey?
she
testifies,
"no,
i
can't
lift
more
than
ten
pounds.
"
what
then
must
the
alj
do
when
the
table
says
that
if
you
are
capable
of
doing
light
work
and
must
lift
up
to
15?
does
this
necessarily
require
a
determination
that
no,
she
can't
do
light
work?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
makes
a
finding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
in
advance
of
the
hearing,
does
she
get
any
kind
of
notice
to
indicate
that
one
of
the
issues
will
be
whether
she
can
or
cannot
lift
15
pounds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
she
get
a
copy
of
the
guidelines
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
garvey.
if
she
doesn't
get
a
copy
of
the
guidelines,
how
does
she
know
the
issue
of
whether
she
can
lift
15
pounds
or
not
will
arise
at
the
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
she
get
access
to
the
guidelines?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
i
gather
she
is
entitled
to
assistance
with
a
counsel,
is
she
not,
if
she
wants
to
bring
someone?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
she
does
not
bring
someone,
none
is
provided
for
her?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
are
they
in
your
briefs,
what
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
nazario,
are
you
making
any
constitutional
argument,
b
of
your
brief
suggests
you
may.
if
you
are
making
a
constitutional
argument,
what
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
the
regulations
entitle
her
to
the
kind
of
hearing
you
say
she
did
not
get.
is
your
case
then
premised
on
a
violation
by
the
secretary
of
his
own
regulation;
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
constitutional
violation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
is
a
statutory
and
under
the
regulations.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
claim,
if
you
are
right
that
the
statute
and
regulations
entitled
her
to
something
which
she
didn't
get?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
due
process
requirements
as
expressed
in
the
regulations
and
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
the
legal
aid
who
wanted
to
charge
her
$35?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
a
private
attorney?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
procedure
under
social
security
to
which
the
claimant
could
go
to
get
instruction
on
how
to
present
a
case
like
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
that
mean,
mr.
garvey,
as
a
practical
matter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
told
about
the
guidelines?
