mr.
john
h.
garvey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
validity
of
regulations
governing
claims
under
the
social
security
act
for
disability
in
cases
that
can't
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
medical
evidence
alone.
in
1979,
the
respondent
who
was
then
51
years
old
applied
for
disability
benefits
under
title
ii
claiming
a
back
problem
and
high
blood
pressure.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
believe
so.
she
had
been
born
in
panama
where
she
was
educated
through
the
sixth
grade,
and
moved
to
the
united
states
in
1964.
between
that
time
and
the
time
of
filing
her
claim,
she
had
worked
as
a
maid
in
a
hotel
and
as
a
seamstress
and
had
injured
her
back
moving
a
laundry
truck.
her
claim
was
denied
initially
and
on
reconsideration
by
the
state
agency,
and
she
then
requested
a
hearing
before
an
administrative
law
judge.
the
administrative
law
judge
took
evidence
on
her
medical
claims,
on
her
back
impairment
and
her
other
claims,
and
concluded
that
she
was
capable
of
doing
light
work
as
that
term
is
defined
in
the
regulations
which
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
administrative
law
judge
also
took
evidence
on
respondent's
age
and
education,
and
on
her
work
experience
and
training,
and
after
consulting
the
guidelines
in
appendix
2
of
the
regulations,
concluded
that
she
was
not
disabled.
the
respondent
then
sought
review
in
the
district
court
which
upheld
the
secretary's
determinations
and
respondent
then
appealed
to
the
second
circuit
which
reversed.
the
second
circuit
held
that
in
cases
which
can't
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
medical
evidence
alone
where
the
claimant
is
incapable
of
doing
her
prior
work,
the
secretary
is
required
to
show
two
things
in
order
to
find
the
claimant
not
disabled.
the
first
thing
the
court
said
the
secretary
must
demonstrate
is
what
the
claimant
can
do,
that
is
to
say,
what
kinds
of
physical
activities
like
lifting
and
walking,
and
what
sort
of
skills
she
may
have
acquired
in
her
past
work.
with
respect
to
that
issue,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
secretary's
determination
that
respondent
was
capable
of
doing
light
work
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
secretary
must
also
introduce
evidence
on
a
second
question.
the
court
said
that
the
secretary
must
show
what
kinds
of
jobs
are
available
for
a
person
who
is
capable
of
doing
what
the
claimant
is
capable
of
doing.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
the
court
of
appeals
as
having
said
that,
because
it
made
no
mention
of
the
due
process
clause.
respondent
contends
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
concerned
about
giving
notice
to
claimants
of
the
issues
which
are
at
stake
in
disability
hearings.
the
secretary
understands
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
done
something
more
radical
than
that.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
what
other
requirement
might
the
court--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--there
is
also
a
statutory--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--there
is
a
statutory
requirement
of
notice
in
section
205(b)
of
the
social
security
act
that
provides
that
the
secretary
must
give
notice
and
reasonable
opportunity
for
a
hearing,
and
the
secretary
has
in
fact
implemented
that
notice
requirement
by
regulations,
and
there
are
a
couple
in
particular.
in
20
cfr
404.938,
the
secretary
has
provided
that
notice
of
a
hearing
will
be
mailed
or
served
at
least
ten
days
before
the
hearing.
it
will
contain
a
statement
of
the
specific
issues
to
be
decided
and
tell
you
that
you
may
designate
a
person
to
represent
you
during
the
proceedings.
the
regulations
then
go
on
to
provide
that
once
the
hearing
has
begun,
the
administrative
law
judge
may
consider
a
new
issue
at
the
hearing,
that
is
to
say,
an
issue
not
raised
at
the
initial
or
reconsideration
stage.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that
is
the
secretary's
contention
in
this
case,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals,
what
it
was
concerned
about
was
that,
the
secretary
had
not
complied
with
the
procedures
which
the
courts
had
used
to
interpret
the
statutory
term
before
these
regulations
had
been
passed.
before
the
regulations
were
enacted,
at
disability
hearings,
the
statute
provided
that
where
the
case
can't
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
medical
evidence
alone,
the
secretary
was
required
to
consider,
under
section
223,
the
claimant's
age,
education,
and
work
experience.
that
job
of
considering
those
vocational
factors,
along
with
the
claimant's
medical
impairment,
in
order
to
decide
what
kinds
of
jobs
are
available
for
the
claimant,
had
been
performed
largely
with
the
assistance
of
vocational
experts.
these
were
people
who
were
rehabilitation
counsellors
or
directors
of
employment
agencies,
and
under
contract
with
the
social
security
administration.
they
would
take
the
stand,
after
all
of
the
evidence
about
the
claimant's
medical
factors
and
vocational
characteristics
had
been
taken,
and
would
be
asked
hypothetical
questions
by
the
administrative
law
judge
about
what
sorts
of
jobs
would
be
available
for
such
a
claimant
if
the
court
determined
that
he
was
able
of
doing
light
work.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
understand
it,
said
in
this
case
that
the
secretary
was
required
to
continue
to
do
that
in
order
to
give
the
claimant
an
opportunity
to
dispute
the
suitability
and
the
availability
of
the
jobs
that
were
noticed.
i
think
the
court's
decision
is
very
much
like,
in
fact
i
think
it
is
identical
to
claims
raised
under
405(g)
decided
by
the
first,
third,
fifth,
seventh,
and
11th
circuits.
in
each
of
those
cases,
what
the
claimant
contended
was
that
the
secretary's
decision
wasn't
supported
by
substantial
evidence
if
the
secretary
didn't
put
on
evidence
about
what
kinds
of
jobs
were
out
there
that
were
suitable
for
a
claimant
of
this
sort.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no,
it
is
not.
you
will
notice
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
at
page
7-a
it
says,
on
the
question
of
what
this
claimant
can
do,
the
record
as
a
whole
supports
the
administrative
law
judge's
finding
that
ms.
campbell
had
the
residual
functional
capacity
to
perform
light
work.
then
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that
there
is
a
second
question
which
must
be
decided,
that
is
to
say,
what
kinds
of
jobs
are
out
there
and
what
their
demands
are.
with
respect
to
that,
the
court
said
the
secretary's
decision
was
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
because
he
had
not
introduced
any
evidence
on
that
question.
but
what
the
secretary
contends
in
this
court
is
that
it
is
unnecessary
for
him
to
introduce
any
evidence
on
that
question
because
the
issue
has
already
been
resolved
by
the
regulations.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
but
it
is
evidence
only
in
the
sense
in
which
any
kind
of
regulation
is
evidence.
what
the
tables
and
the
guidelines
actually
do
is
to
make
unnecessary
the
introduction
of
evidence
on
what
kinds
of
jobs.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that
is
correct.
what
the
secretary
concluded
was
that
those
issues
are
really
legislative
facts
most
appropriately
determined
in
the
course
of
rulemaking
proceedings.
i
might
add
that
that
conclusion
corresponds
to
what
this
court
said
in
matthews
against
eldridge.
what
the
court
there
said
was,
resolution
of
the
inquiry
as
to
the
types
of
employment
opportunities
that
exist
in
the
national
economy
for
a
physically
impaired
worker
with
a
particular
set
of
skills
would
not
necessarily
be
advanced
by
an
evidentiary
hearing.
then
the
court
went
on
to
quote
a
passage
from
professor
davis's
treatise
dealing
with
legislative
facts.
then
the
court
concluded
that
the
statistical
information
relevant
to
this
judgment
is
more
amenable
to
written
than
to
oral
presentation.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
think
that
is
exactly
correct.
at
the
top
of
9-a
what
the
court
says
is
that
in
future
cases,
in
past...
before
and
after
adoption
of
the
guidelines,
this
court
has
required
the
secretary
to
identify
specific
alternative
occupations,
supported
by
a
job
description
clarifying
the
nature
of
the
job
and
demonstrating
that
the
job
does
not
require
exertion
or
skills
not
possessed
by
the
claimant.
the
court
then
goes
on
to
say
that
in
the
past
this
has
been
done
largely
through
the
use
of
vocational
testimony.
then
the
court
says
at
the
top
of
page
10-a
that
if
the
secretary
is
going
to
dispense
with
the
use
of
vocational
experts,
what
he
has
got
to
do
is
provide
a
similar
degree
of
specificity,
and
concludes
"the
key
consideration
in
the
administrative
proceeding
must
be
that
the
claimant
be
given
adequate
opportunity
to
challenge
the
suitability
or
availability
of
the
jobs
noted.
"
if
the
secretary
is
in
fact
required
to
do
that,
then
the
regulations
are
effectively
useless.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
what
the
regulations
say
is
that
in
cases
which
are
specifically
described
by
the
guidelines,
by
the
tables
in
appendix
2,
that
under
those
circumstances,
if
the
findings
of
fact
are
the
same
as
the
rule,
we
use
that
rule
to
decide
whether
a
person
is
disabled.
on
the
question
of
burden
of
proof,
with
respect
to
the
suitability
or
availability
of
jobs
for
people
who
meet
the
requirements
in
the
tables,
the
question
of
burden
of
proof
is
irrelevant
for
the
same
reason
the
substantial
evidence
question
is
irrelevant,
because
that
issue
about
whether
such
jobs
are
available
is
no
longer
litigated
in
these
proceedings,
it
has
been
decided
by
rulemaking.
i
should
add
that
with
respect
to
all
of
the
facts
that
are
unique
to
any
given
claimant,
with
respect
to
that
claimant's
medical
condition,
physical
impairments,
mental
impairments,
the
claimant's
age,
what
kind
of
training
the
claimant
has,
what
kind
of
education
she
has
got,
what
work
she
has
done
in
the
past,
on
all
of
those
questions,
once
the
disability
inquiry
reaches
the
last
stage,
the
secretary
still
maintains
or
still
shoulders
the
burden
of
proof
showing
that
the
claimant
is
capable
of
engaging
in
activity,
all
of
that
notwithstanding,
and
the
regulations
specifically
provide
that
all
of
those
issues
are
open
to
rebuttal
at
the
hearing.
it
might
be
useful
for
me
just
to
describe
briefly
the
reason
for
adopting
these
regulations
and
say
a
few
words
about
the
way
they
work,
and
then
say
a
little
bit
more
about
what
it
was
that
the
secretary
believes
the
court
of
appeals
decided.
until
1978,
before
these
regulations
were
adopted,
indeed
today,
most
disability
cases
can
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
medical
evidence
alone.
it
will
either
show
that
the
claimant
is
so
impaired
that
she
is
unable
to
do
any
work
regardless
of
what
her
vocational
characteristics
are,
or
it
will
show
that
the
claimant's
impairment
is
not
sufficiently
severe
to
warrant
further
inquiry.
in
cases
which
can't
be
decided
simply
on
the
basis
of
medical
evidence,
the
promulgation
of
the
regulations
was
designed
to
displace
the
use
of
vocational
experts
at
hearings
in
determining
the
question
of
what
kinds
of
jobs
were
available
and
suitable
for
claimants
who
are
described
by
the
regulations.
the
general
theme
of
the
regulations
is
this:
for
claimants
whose
impairments
are
not
sufficiently
severe
to
warrant
the
conclusion
of
the
question
right
there,
among
people
who
have
similar
impairments,
what
the
regulations
do
is
to
say
that
the
older
you
are,
the
more
likely
it
is
that
you
will
be
impaired,
that
you
will
be
disabled.
or,
the
less
education
you
have,
or
the
less
training
you
have,
for
people
who
have
similar
impairments,
the
ones
who
are
less
educated,
less
well-trained,
have
no
skills,
it
is
those
people
who
have
an
easier
time
proving
disability
under
the
regulations
which
are
at
stake
in
this
case.
what
the
tables...
at
the
conclusion
in
appendix
2,
what
those
tables
do
is
to
classify
jobs
according
to
their
gross
physical
demands.
for
example,
the
table
that
deals
with
light
work
in
this
case
assumes
that
people
who
are
able
to
do
light
work
are
able
to
undertake
such
activities
as
carrying
more
than
ten
pounds
frequently,
and
occasionally
20
pounds,
that
they
are
able
to
do
a
good
deal
of
walking
or
standing
or,
if
the
job
involves
sitting,
they
are
able
to
do
such
things
as
pushing
or
pulling
of
arm
and
leg
controls.
for
people
whose
impairment
is
only
of
that
sort,
only
in
the
kinds
of
gross
physical
demands
of
which
the
tables
take
notice,
the
secretary
has
said
that
for
those
who
are
capable
of
doing
light
work,
that
there
are
some
1600
jobs,
different
types
of
occupations
in
the
national
economy,
which
can
be
performed
by
people
of
that
sort.
these
are
simple
jobs
that
anybody
can
learn
to
do
in
less
than
30
days.
they
are
jobs
like--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--indeed.
in
fact,
the
respondent
in
this
case
disputed
that
she
was
unable
to
lift
20
pounds
on
at
least
two
occasions.
at
her
hearing,
she
introduced
evidence
from
her
doctor,
dr.
lowenthal,
on
a
form
which
the
social
security
administration
has
designed
to
address
just
that
question,
the
joint
appendix
on
page
32.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no,
not
necessarily.
what
happens
is
what
has
always
happened
in
these
disability
cases,
the
administrative
law
judge
considers
her
evidence
along
with
the
contrary
evidence
which
is
introduced--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--and
makes
a
finding
with
respect
to
how
many
pounds
she
is
able
to
lift.
had
the
administrative
law
judge
in
this
case
concluded
that
she
was
not
capable
of
lifting
that
weight,
then
he
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
apply
table
2.
he
would
have
been
required,
at
a
minimum,
to
apply
table
1
which
would
have
determined
that
she
was
disabled
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
the
notice
which
she
gets
in
advance
of
the
hearing
appears
in
the
administrative
record,
and
it
says
that
"the
issues
at
your
hearing
will
be
how
severe
your
impairment
is.
"
"the
impairment
must
be
so
severe
as
to
prevent
you
from
not
only
not
engaging
in
your
usual
work,
but
considering
your
age,
education
and
work
experience,
prevent
you
from
engaging
in
any
other
kind
of
substantial
gainful
work.
"
mr.
john
h.
garvey
she
does
not
get
a
copy
of
the
guidelines.
claimants
do
get
a
copy--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--she
is
told
that
the
guidelines
will
apply.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
the
guidelines
are
available
at
social
security
administration
branch
offices.
she
is
also
told
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing,
as
she
was
in
this
case
by
the
alj,
that
the
issue
will
be
how
much...
the
issue
will
be
your
ability
to
stand,
sit,
lift,
walk,
carry,
and
similar
facts
of
that
sort.
on
page
37
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
administrative
law
judge
said:
"what
we
are
interested
in
is
your
capacity
to
engage
in
sedentary
light,
medium,
or
heavy
work.
"
"what
we're
taking
into
account
is
your
ability
to
walk,
stand,
sit,
lift,
push,
pull,
carry--
"
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--yes,
she
is.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that's
correct,
although
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
the
administrative
law
judge
at
these
hearings
does
not
represent
the
secretary.
the
administrative
law
judge
is
charged
under
the
regulations
with
fully
bringing
out
both
the
claimant's
side
of
the
case
and
the
secretary's
side
of
the
case.
we
think
that
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
in
this
case
in
fact
demonstrates
the
administrative
law
judge
questioned
the
respondent
on
each
of
these
characteristics
which
are
made
relevant
by
the
tables.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
she
is
not
specifically
told
in
any
of
the
notices
which
are
mailed
to
her
that
the
question
will
be
whether
she
can
lift
15
pounds.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
she
can
be
told
at
the
hearing,
in
fact,
it
is
quite
proper--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--she
was
not
told
that
she
would
be
measured
at
any
time.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no.
she
was
told
that
she
would
be
measured
by
how
much
she
could
lift,
whether
she
could
lift
weight,
and
she
testified
that
she
was
unable
to
lift
anything.
she
introduced
a
form
which
her
doctor
had
given
her
saying
that
she
was
unable
to
lift
more
than
ten
pounds.
so
it
is
not
a
question
of
her
having
been
unable
to
meet
the
evidence.
as
you
stress,
it's
appropriate,
in
fact
perhaps
desirable,
for
the
administrative
law
judge
to
bring
to
the
claimant's
attention
that
the
question
at
disability
hearings
is
what
you
can
lift,
what
you
can
carry,
how
far
you
can
walk,
how
long
you
can
stand.
the
office
of
hearings
and
appeals
has
designed,
in
the
training
of
administrative
law
judges,
and
has
circulated
a
kind
of
manual
which
tells
them
how
they
ought
to
conduct
these
hearings.
the
statements
that
are
made
by
the
administrative
law
judge
at
the
beginning
of
this
hearing
on
pages
36,
37,
38,
and
39,
are
taken
almost
verbatim
from
those
instructions
to
administrative
law
judges
about
how
to
conduct
the
hearing,
about
what
to
tell
the
claimant.
the
administrative
law
judge
in
this
case,
as
the
manual
provided,
said
that
"what
we
are
concerned
about
is
not
only
whether
you
can
do
your
own
job,
but
whether
you
can
do
other
jobs.
"
"in
deciding
that,
what
we
want
to
know
is
what
your
age
is,
what
education
you
have,
what
work
experience
you've
got.
"
he
then
goes
to
say,
we
are
also
going
to
ask
whether
you
can
do
sedentary
or
light
or
medium
work.
in
deciding
that
question,
what
we
want
to
know
is
your
ability
to
walk,
stand,
sit,
lift,
push,
pull
or
carry.
he
told
her
all
of
those
things
at
the
beginning
of
her
hearing.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
what
she
would
then
have
succeeded
in
proving
was
that
that
was
the
wrong
table
to
apply
to
her,
or
that
for
some
reason
the
tables
didn't
apply.
in
cases
where
the
claimant
is
unable
to
perform
these
kinds
of
jobs
because
she
can't
see
or
because
she
has
difficulty
hearing,
or
because
she
has
some
problem
with
fine
motor
skills,
arthritis
in
the
fingers,
for
example,
or
she's
got
epilepsy,
or
she's
got
an
allergy
to
dust
and
is
unable
to
work
outdoors,
in
those
kinds
of
cases
the
tables
do
not
apply.
in
those
kinds
of
cases
the
regulations
specifically
say,
if
you
look
at
section
200(e)
of
appendix
2
which
appears
on
page
56-a,
section
200(e)(1)
says,
in
the
evaluation
of
disability,
where
the
individual
has
solely
a
non-exertional
type
of
impairment...
that
is
sight,
hearing,
fine
motor
skills...
the
rules
do
not
direct
factual
conclusions
of
disabled
or
not
disabled.
so
all
of
the
evidence
which
you
mention
would
be
perfectly
appropriate,
and
indeed
that
sort
of
question
is
asked
by
the
administrative
law
judge
before
first
deciding
whether
the
tables
can
be
applied
at
all.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
would
suppose
so.
i
presume
that
in
that
case
what
she
would
have
proved
is
that
the
kinds
of
occupations
of
which
the
secretary
took
notice
in
the
rulemaking
proceeding
don't
in
fact
exist.
what
she
would
have
proved
is
that
the
regulations
are
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
that
case,
but
there
is
no--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--i
should
emphasize
again--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--absolutely,
there
are
many
such
cases.
there
are
many
such
cases.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
don't
believe
so,
because
the
second
circuit
continually
said
that
what
the
secretary
had
failed
to
do
was
to
introduce
evidence
about
these
kinds
of
jobs
to
show
(a)
that
they
were
available
and
(b)
that
they
were
suitable
for
somebody
who,
the
second
circuit
had
already
said,
was
capable
of
doing
light
work.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
there
are
many
cases
in
which
the
tables
cannot
be
applied
because
the
claimant
has
some
other
disability
which
doesn't
fit
within
the
description
of
light
work.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that
is
correct.
it
doesn't
seem
as
though
it
would
be
a
great
burden,
but
the
problem
with
construing
it
as
simply
a
kind
of
notice
as
respondent
was
due
in
this
case,
is
that
it
focuses
on
what
is
absolutely
the
most
esoteric
point
about
the
whole
disability
determination
process.
if
you
tell
somebody,
who
has
been
a
seamstress
or
a
hotel
maid
most
of
her
life,
that
she
is
capable
of
operating
a
pinking
machine
or
cutting
newspaper
clippings
for
a
business
service,
it
really
tells
her
very
little
that
she
is
interested
in
knowing.
it
tells
her
very
little
about
the
issues
in
the
disability
hearing.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
certainly,
although
it
tells
them--
what
the
secretary
is
really
interested
in
in
this
case
is
not
whether
she
is
capable
of
operating
a
pinking
machine,
but
whether
she
is
capable
of
doing...
what
her
impairments
are.
how
much
is
she
capable
of
lifting,
carrying,
how
far
she
can
walk
or
stand,
and
whether
she
has
any
other
kinds
of
physical
impairments,
what
her
age
and
education
are.
with
respect
to
those
questions,
the
mere
mention
of
jobs
like
operating
a
pinking
machine
tells
you
very
little.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
have
a
couple
of
brief
points.
the
first
is
with
respect
to
the
contention
that
the
respondent
had
no
opportunity
to
put
on
evidence
regarding
her
non-exertional
impairments.
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing,
the
alj
informed
respondent
that
any
non-exertional
impairments
that
she
might
have
would
be
issues
in
the
hearing.
in
our
reply
brief,
at
pages
11
to
14,
in
the
notes
we
indicate
the
passages
at
which
each
of
those
contentions
was
addressed.
i
should
add
that
in
those
kinds
of
cases
where
non-exertional
impairments
are
present,
then
the
question
is
what
kind
of
work
somebody
can
do.
the
tables
are
not
used,
as
i
emphasized
before.
what
will
happen
in
those
kinds
of
cases
most
often
is
that
the
secretary
will
call
a
vocational
expert
to
see
what
kind
of
work
is
available
for
people
who
can
do
that.
with
the
respect
to
the
question
of
her
representation
by
counsel,
i
might
just
add
a
point
which
does
not
appear
in
our
brief.
a
senate
finance
committee
report,
cp-9716,
issued
just
in
august
of
'82,
indicates
that,
contrary
to
what
professor
davis
thinks,
in
disability
cases,
71
percent
of
claimants
are
in
fact
represented
by
counsel.
i
might
add
that
for
those
claimants
who
are
not
represented
by
counsel,
the
notice
which
they
receive
in
advance
of
hearing
tells
them,
as
they
told
respondent
in
this
case,
that
"the
people
at
your
local
social
security
office
will
continue
to
assist
you
in
obtaining
any
evidence
you
may
wish
to
submit.
"
mr.
john
h.
garvey
as
a
practical
matter,
what
it
means
is
that
they
may
go
to
the
social
security
office
and
ask
what
kinds
of
evidence
will
help
them
to
bolster
their
claim.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
they
are
told...
if
they
went
to
the
social
security
office
and
inquired
about
the
guidelines,
they
would
be
told
about
the
guidelines.
the
secretary
does
not
resist
telling
claimants
about
the
guidelines.
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
informed
by
the
alj
that
the
regulations
in
appendix
2
would
be
applied.
there
is
a
notice...
i
am
sorry,
my
time
has
run.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
if
i
may
just
finish
that
sentence.
the
notice
of
hearing
which
appears
at
the
end
of
the
secretary's
brief,
this
form
ha-4607,
does
not
appear
in
respondent's
record
as
it
does
not
appear
in
any
records.
these
kinds
of
forms
which
don't
pertain
to
individual
claimants
simply
are
not
stuck
into
the
record.
they
are
sent
along
with
any
mailings
that
the
claimant
gets,
and
it
informs
them
that
the
regulations
in
appendix
2
will
be
applied.
you
will
notice
that
the
notice
of
hearing
respondent
got
indicates
that
there
was
an
enclosure,
and
it
is
likely
that
form.
