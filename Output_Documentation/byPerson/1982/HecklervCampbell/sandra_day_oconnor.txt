mr.
garvey,
do
you
interpret
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
as
perhaps
being
based
on
some
kind
of
due
process,
lack
of
notice
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
short
of
a
due
process
requirement
of
notice,
what
other
requirement
would
there
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
notice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this
a
substantial
evidence
case
for
us,
then?
your
cert
petition
treats
it
as
though
the
court
had
invalidated
the
grid
system
in
some
kind
of
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary,
and
yet
the
court
didn't
expressly
do
that.
are
you
telling
us,
then,
that
it
really
is
a
case
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
you
are
arguing
that
the
grid
system
is
evidence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
the
regulations
which
you're
relying
on
contained
here
in
the
petition
or
the
appendix
or
something,
and
if
so
where?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
regulation
is
it,
and
is
it
set
forth
any
place
in
the
papers
that
we
have
before
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
let
me
interrupt
your
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
information
available
on
the
procedures
and
requirements
and
the
regulation
at
the
branch
offices
of
the
social
security?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
presumably
there
would
be
staff
present
to
explain.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
nazario,
there
is
some
indication,
is
there
not,
that
congress
has
pressed
the
secretary
to
promulgate
a
grid
system
or
regulations
such
as
those
that
are
employed
here,
is
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
basically,
the
secretary
in
promulgating
this
system
is
carrying
out
the
wishes
of
congress;
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
did
not
state
that
the
secretary
had
failed
to
apply
his
own
regulation,
did
it?
