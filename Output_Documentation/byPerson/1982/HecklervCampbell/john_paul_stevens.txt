justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
maybe
it
is
unrealistic
with
1600
jobs
that
are
available
for
this
physical
impairment,
but
supposing
she
was
familiar
with
the
regulation
and
she
wanted
to
prove
that
all
the
jobs
in
the
category
required
some
skill,
such
as
speaking
english,
or
reading,
or
something
that
she
did
not
have,
and
therefore,
she
couldn't
perform
any
of
them.
assume
she
was
successful
in
that
kind
of
proof
for
some
reason
other
reason
other
than
physical
impairment,
would
she
then
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
still
not
clear
what
happens
if
she
proves
that
even
though
he
has
correctly
described
her
physical
condition,
she
can't
perform
any
of
the
1600
jobs.
what
happens
in
the
proceeding?
does
she
win?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wouldn't
necessarily
think
that
they
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
all
cases,
it
is
just
that
she
has
some
particular
incapacity
for...
of
course,
i
admit,
it
is
a
hard
case
to
assume,
with
1600
jobs,
presumably
she
ought
to
be
able
to
perform
some
of
them.
but
i
suppose
and
the
second
circuit's
view
is,
they
could
forestall
that
by
telling
her...
the
alj
merely
has
to
tell
her,
here
are
10
or
15
jobs
that
under
the
schedule
you
can
perform,
and
give
her
a
chance
to
prove
otherwise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
understand
you
view,
there
are
cases
in
which
the
regulations,
at
least
theoretically,
might
not
be
dispositive
if
she--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
is
it
correct
that
one
could
interpret
the
second
circuit
as
holding,
as
just
imposing
a
requirement
on
the
hearing
officer
to
be
sure
that
this
isn't
one
of
those
cases.
to
give
the
claimant
an
opportunity
to
say,
"well,
here
is
a
representative
group
of
1600
jobs.
"
"is
there
any
reason
why
you
can't
perform
these
jobs?
"
is
that
all
that
the
second
circuit
requires?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
one
were
to
construe
the
second
circuit
opinion
in
the
way
i
suggested
it
might
be
read,
how
big
a
problem
would
it
be
for
the
secretary?
are
there
many
cases
like
this
one
in
the
second
circuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
true
regardless
of
whether
you
follow
the
second
circuit
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
does
tell
her
more
than
handing
her
a
card
with
1600
jobs
on
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
here.
do
you
read
the
second
circuit
opinion
as
holding
that
if
the
administrative
law
judge
had,
just
before
he
or
she
ruled,
said:
now
there
are
15
jobs
here
on
this
list
that
people
who
are
capable
of
doing
light
work
can
perform,
and
under
the
regulations
you
can
perform
these.
if
he
had
just
said
that
to
her,
so
she
could
have
put
in
evidence
that
she
couldn't
perform
those
15
jobs,
would
that
have
been
all
that
the
alj
had
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
particular
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
ten
or
15.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
that
instead
of
doing
that,
the
alj
had
said:
the
secretary
has
a
regulation
that
lists
1600
jobs
that
people
who
can
do
light
work
can
do.
here
is
a
copy
of
that
regulation.
then
he
let
her
take
an
hour
to
look
at
it
and
then
if
she
wanted
to,
try
to
prove
she
couldn't
perform
any
of
those
jobs.
would
that
have
satisfied
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
am
really
trying
to
find
out.
you
seem
to
agree
that
if
the
alj
had
said:
here
are
15
jobs
that
you
should
be
able
to
perform,
if
instead
of
that
he
had
listed
or
read
all
1600--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nazario,
may
i
ask
another
question.
on
page
37
of
the
joint
appendix
there
is
a
transcript
of
what
the
alj
said
to
her
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing.
he
did
say
that
the
evidence
about
her
ability
to
do
other
kinds
of
work,
as
well
as
her
past
work.
he
asked
about
her
ability
to
walk,
stand,
sit,
lift,
push,
pull
or
carry.
then
he
goes
on
and
says:
"i
will
take
evidence
and
consider
any
mental,
skin,
sensory
or
environmental
impairment
that
might
limit
your
capacity
to
work.
"
isn't
that
pretty
good
notice
of
the
fact
that
any
other
disability
would
also
be
considered?
why
isn't
that
notice
adequate
under
the
regulations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
that
if
he
had
repeated
this
statement
while
she
was
testifying,
then
you
really
wouldn't
have
a
case?
