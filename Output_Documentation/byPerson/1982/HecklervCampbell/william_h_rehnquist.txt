justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
garvey,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
mention
that
section
that
you
have
just
quoted
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
understand
it,
we
have
a
statute
here
and
we
have
regulations
issued
pursuant
to
the
secretary's
authority
under
405(a),
and
the
court
of
appeals
could
decide
against
the
secretary
in
this
case
only
if
it
either
decided
that
the
regulation
wasn't
authorized
by
the
statute
or
that
the
statute
had
some
sort
of
constitutional
infirmity
in
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
understand
to
have
been
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals,
if
it
had
any?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
really
dispenses
with
the
need
for
this
sort
of
a
proof
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
was
required.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
source
of
those
procedural
rights,
mr.
nazario?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
cite
each
of
those
regulations
or
statutory
provisions
that
you
have
just
mentioned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nazario,
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion,
as
i
read
it,
made
no
mention
of
any
constitutional
claim
that
you
asserted
under
the
federal
constitution.
did
you
raise
your
constitutional
claim
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
asked
you
a
question.
did
you
raise
your
constitutional
claim
in
your
argument
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
phrase
that
in
terms
of
a
constitutional
violation
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
she
obligated
to
do
a
little
something
for
herself,
if
she
is
depending
on
benefits,
if
she
is
trying
to
get
benefits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
she
could
have
been
expected
to
go
to
the
district
office?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
were
available
there?
