was

unknown
speaker
was
this
on
motion
for
summary
judgment?
unknown
speaker
in
your
case
it
is
just
the
union
that
is
here--
unknown
speaker
--not
the
employer.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
weinberg,
do
you
think
the
silence
of
the
congress
in
the
many
other
kinds
of
federal
causes
of
action
where
state
statutes
have
been
implied
was
taken
to
mean
that
state
law
was
intended
by
congress?
that
was
really
the
only
place
to
turn.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
think
10(b)
should
govern
not
only
against
the
union
but
against
the
employer?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
your
opposition
thinks
that
hoosier
is
authority
for
just
the
opposite.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
action
was
in
humphrey?
unknown
speaker
did
you
not
say
humphrey
said
was
a
301?
unknown
speaker
the
employer
was
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
the
employer
was
a
party?
unknown
speaker
mr.
groner,
how
well
off
is
an
employee
in
new
york,
say,
where
this
case
arose
going
to
be
if
the
statute
of
limitations
against
the
employer
is
30
days
and
the
statute
of
limitations
against
the
union
is
two
years.
is
generally
the
action
against
the
union
worth
pursuing
even
if
the
statute
has
run
against
the
employer?
unknown
speaker
so
he
is
going
to
have
to
prove
his
cause
of
action
against
the
union
he
is
going
to
have
to
prove
there
was
a
breach
of
contract,
i
suppose,
by
the
employer.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
if
there
was
not
a
breach
of
conduct
by
the
employer
there
may
not
have
been
any
breach
by
the
union
at
all.
unknown
speaker
the
union
just
did
not
underrepresent
him
if
there
was
no
breach
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
groner,
i
am
not
sure
you
answered
justice
rehnquist.
i
probably
interrupted
before
you
could,
but
what
damages
could
you
get
against
the
union
in
new
york
now
if
the
action
against
the
employer
is
barred?
unknown
speaker
could
you
collect
from
the
union
all
the
damages
that
you
might
have
collected
against
the
employer
if
the
action
against
the
employer
was
not
barred?
unknown
speaker
but
the
employer
is
out
of
the
case
entirely.
unknown
speaker
what
would
that
be,
though?
what
would
that
be
because
the
case
did
go
to
arbitration
and
there
has
not
been
any...
the
union's
breach
has
not
delayed
resolution
of
the
case
by
arbitration.
the
arbitration
decision
has
been
had.
now
what
damages
could
you
get
against
the
union.
what
would
be
the
allocation
if
you
won
against
the
union?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
those
damages?
unknown
speaker
you
cannot
get
it
from
the
employer.
unknown
speaker
because
the
employer
is
out
of
the
case
at
the
end
of
90
days,
you
think
everything
you
could
have
collected
from
the
employer
could
now
be
collected
from
the
union
under
the
existing
cases?
unknown
speaker
you
could
get
all
of
the
back
pay
from
the
union?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
rules
of
decision
act
preclude
application
of
10(b)?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
the
statute
forbids,
the
rules
of
decision
act
forbids
our
resort
to
10(b).
unknown
speaker
well,
then
the...
any
reservation
in
mitchell
was
beside
the
point.
reserving
the
question
about
10(b)
should
not
have
been
reserved
at
all.
it
has
already
been...
under
your
view
the
rules
of
decision
act
would
give
only
one
answer
to
that
question
that
was
left
open,
namely
that
10(b)
is
not
available
at
all.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
are
saying
that
we
are
not
permitted
by
the
statute
to
look
to
state
law
in
this
situation?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
is
the
bottom
line
of
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
if
congress
provided
a
statute
of
limitations
for
the
complex
of
interest--
unknown
speaker
--just
by
analogy
then.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
