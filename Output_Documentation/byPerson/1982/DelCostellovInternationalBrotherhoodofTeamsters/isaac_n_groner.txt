mr.
isaac
n.
groner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
flower
and
jones
are
before
the
court
to
request
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below
which
held
that
the
appropriate
statute
of
limitations
was
that
applicable
to
non-medical
malpractice.
that
judgment
should
be
affirmed
essentially
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
substance
and
purpose
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
clearly
makes
the
most
analogous
state
statute
of
limitations
that
applicable
to
legal
malpractice,
and
secondly,
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
law
that
has
been
established
with
respect
to
statutes
of
limitations
would
require
that
the
statute
of
limitation
to
be
applied
in
a
duty
of
fair
representation
case
against
the
union
be
the
most
analogous
state
statute
of
limitations.
with
respect
to
the
substance
and
purpose
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
from
the
beginning
of
its
statement
in
the
steel
case
throughout
every
discussion
of
it,
that
duty
has
consisted
of
a
correlative
duty
which
arises
from
the
right
of
the
union
to
represent
all
of
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit,
and
the
correlative
duty
is
to
represent
each
and
all
of
the
employees
without
discrimination,
to
represent
them
fairly.
in
the
steel
case
the
analogy
was
made
to
a
legislature.
it
was
held
that
the
right
to
represent
all
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
was
analogous
to
the
right
of
the
legislature
to
pass
laws
which
were
applicable
to
all
the
citizens
and
that
if
there
were
no
duty
that
that
right
be
exercised
in
a
fair
way,
constitutional
questions
might
even
arise
so
that
we
are
concerned
in
the
duty
of
fair
representation
with
questions
of
fair
treatment
that
may
rise
to
the
stature
of
constitutional
questions.
what
we
have
and
what
the
court
has
repeatedly
held
is
that
the
supreme
and
basic
value
in
a
duty
of
fair
representation
is
protection
for
the
individual.
it
is
to
ensure
that
the
individual
employee
will
not
be
the
victim
of
unfair
treatment,
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
was
not
only
established
in
the
first
place,
but
has
consistently
been
recognized
and
enforced
by
this
court.
it
is
a
representational
duty.
in
speaking
of
representational
duties
and
in
asking
what
is
the
appropriate
analogy
to
a
representational
duty
we
would
suggest
that
the
immediate
answer
that
occurs
is
that
of
the
relationship
between
an
attorney
and
a
client.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
the
statute
for
the
arbitration
would
be
90
days
in
new
york,
but
the
answer
is
yes,
your
honor.
presumably
we
would
be
concerned
with
cases
where
no
action
was
brought
within
the
90
days
so
that
we
have
a
situation...
as
a
practical
matter,
we
may
have
a
situation
where
to
enforce
the
same
statute
of
limitations
against
the
union
as
has
been
enforced
against
the
employer
would
be
to
deprive
that
individual
employee
of
any
opportunity
to
gain
redress
from
what
he
will
have
to
prove
has
been
an
arbitrary
action
by
his
union
and
represent
him
in
the
arbitration
case.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
he
would
have
to
prove
that
there
was
a
breach
of
contract
by
the
employer.
in
other
words,
just
as
in
a
legal
malpractice
action,
you
have
two
elements
of
the
cause
of
action.
one,
you
must
prove
misconduct
by
the
attorney.
secondly,
you
must
to
prove
damages
in
effect
you
must
prove
that
the
misconduct
by
the
attorney
altered
the
result.
that
is
to
say
you
would
have
won
the
case
but
for
the
misconduct
of
the
attorney.
similarly
in
the
case
against
the
union,
you
must
prove
not
only
the
misconduct
but
that
the
misconduct
in
effect
made
a
difference.
that
is
to
say
that
barring
the
misconduct--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
--the
breach
by
the
union
in
terms
of
presenting
the
employee's
grievance--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
--the
question
is
did
the
underrepresentation
make
it
possible
that
there
be
a
conclusion
that
there
was
no
breach
and
in
the
action
against
the
union
the
employee
plaintiff
would
prove
as
the
plaintiff's
allege
in
this
case
that
had
the
case
been
investigated
and
presented
within
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
the
arbitration
award
would
have
been.
but
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
contract,
the
kind
of
holding
that
your
honors
just
a
few
months
ago
in
the
bowen
case
pointed
out
that
the
decision
there
where
the
case
was
not
taken
to
the
jury
the
assessment
of
damages
against
the
union
was
predicated
upon
the
proposition
that
had
the
union
taken
the
case
to
arbitration
there
would
have
been
proof
that
the
employer
breached
the
agreement
in
that
case.
in
that
case
it
was
an
unfair
discharge.
in
this
case
it
is
a
question
of
a
job
assignment
and
ultimately
lay
off
and
termination.
so
that
the
very
point
of
the
duty
of
unfair
practice
responsibility
and
action
is
to
demonstrate
that
with
proper
representation
by
the
union
the
plaintiff's
grievance
would
have
been
vindicated.
it
would
have
been
carried
forward
successfully.
where
it
has
been
carried
to
arbitration
that
the
award
would
have
favored
the
union.
this
analogy
of
having
to
prove
that
you
would
have
won
had
there
been
proper
conduct
is
not
the
only
point
of
similarity
between
the
attorney-client
relationship
and
the
employee-union
relationship.
the
essence
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
precisely
that
the
individual
is
in
a
uniquely
vulnerable
position.
he
is
being
represented
by
someone
who
has
a
special
status
under
the
law,
in
the
attorney
case
by
state
law,
in
the
federal
case
by
section
9(a)
or
by
analogous
provisions
of
the
labor
act.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
we
would
get
the
damages--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
--there
might
be
questions
of
apportionment
that
would
arise,
but
essentially,
yes.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
essentially,
yes.
you
would
be
able
to
recover
from
the
union
the
damages
that
flowed
from
the
fact
that
it
did
not--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
--the
damages
that
flow
from
the
fact
in
our
view
that
the
arbitration
decision
was
incorrect--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
--and,
therefore,
the
damages
that
would
flow
would
be
the
damages
that
would
follow
had
the
award--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
--the
damages
would
be
the
back
pay--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
--in
the
duty
of
fair
representation
case
you
would
get
that
from
the
union
in
the
same
sense
that
bowen
held
that
it
could
recover
from
the
union.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
am
not...
the
answer
is
yes
but--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
--while
i
answer
yes,
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
that
is
not
an
essential
answer
to
the
issue
that
is
before
this
court.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
what
should
be
the
statute
of
limitations
for
an
action
against
the
union
whether
the
action
against
the
union
should
also
be
barred
in
the
90-day
period
that
mitchell
held
that
in
new
york
it
should
be
barred
as
against
the
employer.
the
statute
of
limitations
should
not
be
the
same,
your
honor,
because
the
elements
of
the
claim
against
the
union,
the
relief
requested
against
the
union
are
not
the
same.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
is
precluded
from
adopting
any
statute--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
--there
is
nothing
in
my
view
that
would
preclude
this
court
from
interpreting
that
statute
or
any
other
in
some
other
way.
i
would
urge
your
honors
that
while
you
have
the
power
that
the
power
ought
to
be
exercised
in
accordance
with
the
law
and
justice,
and
i
would
urge
your
honors
that
the
consistent
interpretation
of
the
rules
of
decision
act
has
precisely
been
that
in
terms
of
statutes
of
limitations
when
there
are
federal
rights
and
it
comes
to
deciding
what
statute
of
limitations
should
be
employed
to
the
enforcement
of
that
right
that
the
appropriate
state
statute
should
be
applied.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
precisely,
your
honor,
yes
indeed,
and
not
only
the
rules
in
decision
act
but
every
decision
of
this
court
including
mitchell
which
itself
applied
a
state
statute
centering
on
hoosier
which
in
its
text
did
discuss
whether
or
not
congress
intended
that
the
10(b)
statute
of
limitations
should
be
applied.
for
those
reasons,
the
decision
should
be
that
the
most
analogous
state
statute
should
be
applied
and
in
the
case
against
the
union
the
most
analogous
state
statute
in
our
view
is
that
which
is
directed
to
legal
malpractice.
to
hold
that
10(b)
should
apply,
your
honors,
would
be
to
make
a
judgment
that
is
contrary
to
every
pertinent
decision
of
this
court
and
is
also
contrary
to
the
purpose
and
the
function
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
not
implied
alone
or
even
in
principle
measure
in
our
view
from
section
9(a).
section
9(a)
is
what
creates
the
right
in
the
union
to
represent
all
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit,
but
it
does
not
state
what
correlative
duty
flows
from
that
right.
that
correlative
duty
is
based
upon
basic
notions
of
justice
embedded
in
the
common
law
as
to
all
kinds
of
representational
relationships.
it
is
a
principle
of
justice
that
goes
beyond
attorney-client
or
employee-union,
that
those
who
take
upon
themselves
the
task
of
representing
others
must
perform
that
task
with
due
regard
for
the
rights
of
others
and
above
all
they
must
not
prejudice
the
rights
of
others.
they
must
realize
that
they
are
in
a
position
of
greater
knowledge.
they
must
realize
that
they
are
in
a
position
of
higher
responsibility.
they
must
realize
the
utter
dependence
under
the
circumstances
that
those
they
are
representing
are
looking
to
them
for.
they
are
in
a
sense
helpless
in
the
situation.
the
individuals
do
not
have
the
knowledge.
they
do
not
have
the
experience.
they
do
not
have
the
training.
what
is
involved
here
is
a
special
representational
relationship
and
justice
as
embedded
in
historic
notions
of
fairness
in
the
law
says
that
the
representative
must
be
held
accountable
and
that
that
duty
to
be
held
accountable
to
the
individual
is
correlative.
it
is
as
extensive
as
the
right
to
represent
all
of
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit.
in
hoosier
in
the
hoosier
cardinal
case
the
court
was
confronted
by
a
statute
of
limitations
problem.
now,
the
precise
issue
in
the
hoosier
cardinal
case
was
one
of
a
suit
by
a
union
to
enforce
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
we
submit
that
the
rationale
of
that
case
is
directly
applicable
to
the
issue
of
10(b)
for
the
court
said
we
are
urged
judicially
to
invent
a
statute
of
limitations.
but
the
court
said
when
the
congress
came
to
establishing
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
creating
and
defining
an
administrative
procedure
for
that
unfair
labor
practice
it
defined
a
statute
of
limitations
of
six
months,
but
when
it
came
to
section
301
it
did
not
establish
a
statute
of
limitations.
that
contrast
this
court
explained
in
hoosier,
that
contrast
meant
that
when
an
action
is
based
upon
section
301
the
appropriate
state
statute
of
limitations
should
be
applied.
this
court
held
that
it
was
a
matter
of
congressional
intention
and
that
it
was
demonstrated
by
the
contrast
between
the
lack
of
statute
in
301
and
the
presence
of
a
definite
statute
of
limitations
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
congress
did
not
mean
for
that
to
be
applied
in
the
other.
rather
congress
intended
that
the
state
statute
of
limitations
should
apply.
congress
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
put
in
different
titles,
different
subchapters
of
the
united
states
code
when
it
was
codified.
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
section
301
and
the
six-month
statute
of
limitations
had
not
been
applied
to
section
302
statutes,
section
303
claims,
nor
has
it
been
applied
to
causes
of
action
which
congress
created
in
further
defining
the
national
labor
policy
of
the
united
states
creating
causes
of
action
that
are
very
close
to
in
ultimate
purpose
of
protecting
the
individuals
to
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
when
it
passed
the
labor
management
relations
act
in
1959
and
when
in
1970
it
passed
the
postal
reform
act,
it
established
rights
upon
which
it
imposed
no
statutes
of
limitations.
this
court
has
many
times
pointed
out
the
difference
between
the
public
responsibilities
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
private
interest
of
individual
plaintiffs
in
these
duties
of
fair
representation
action.
this
court
has
held
that
the
paramount
value
in
terms
of
duty
of
fair
representation
is
protection
of
the
rights
of
individual
employees.
a
distinction
has
been
drawn
between
the
responsibilities
to
serve
the
public
purposes
and
the
right
of
the
individual
to
bring
a
law
suit
according
to
the
traditional
law
to
have
available
to
him
as
steel
said
traditional
forms
of
legal
redress.
this
court
has
held
that
even
claims
of
insubstantial
values
ought
to
be
protected
because
it
was
such
a
paramount
purpose
that
individuals
should
be
protected
from
abuse
from
unfair
treatment
by
their
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
now,
in
hoosier
you
could
have
said
that
the
cause
of
action
was
likewise
based
upon
the
national
labor
relations
act
because
how
did
the
union
get
the
opportunity
and
get
the
right
to
speak
for
all
of
the
employees
and
to
bring
that
action
to
enforce
the
contract.
it
got
it
by
virtue
of
its
status
under
section
9(a),
the
right
to
represent
all
employees
and
sign
the
contract,
and
it
got
the
right
to
bring
that
action
under
section
301
which
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
of
course,
endowed
courts
with
substantive
rights,
the
right
to
declare
substantive
law
and
is
not
merely
a
procedural
statute.
likewise
here
the
claim
is
a
claim
that
is
based
upon
long
standing
legal
principles
of
individuals
not
to
be
unfairly
treated
by
their
representatives,
and
that
right
not
to
be
represented
by
the
individuals
is
not
a
right
that
is
derived
from
section
9(a).
it
is
a
right
of
substantive
law
that
is
part
of
the
301
grant
of
power
by
congress
and
part
of
the
rights
that
ought
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
appropriate
statute
of
limitations.
there
has
been
some
talk
about
the
party's
ability
to
rely
on
the
decision
here,
and
the
rule
of
the
law
of
the
shop.
if
these
parties
wanted
to
rely
on
the
arbitrator's
award
as
much
as
they
imply
to
this
court
that
they
do,
they
could
obviously
have
written
the
substance
of
the
award
into
their
contract.
we
believe
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
