mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
here
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
steelworkers
union
in
the
flowers
case.
i
can
state
the
facts
of
flowers
very
simply.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
respondents
here,
had
a
grievance
over
work
assignment.
they
took
their
grievance
to
the
union.
the
union
processed
the
grievance
through
all
four
steps
of
the
grievance
process
and
then
took
the
case
to
arbitration.
the
arbitrator
ruled
against
the
union.
eleven
months
later
this
suit
was
brought.
it
is
a
hybrid
section
301
breach
duty
of
fair
representation
suit
against
both
the
company
and
the
union.
both
defendants
moved
to
dismiss
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds.
after
some
ups
and
downs
through
the
courts,
the
court
below
dismissed
the
case
against
the
employer
holding
that
after
mitchell
the
90-day
new
york
statute
of
limitations
governing
suits
to
vacate
arbitration
awards
apply.
as
to
the
case
against
the
union,
however,
the
court
below
ruled
that
the
new
york
statute
of
limitations,
a
three-year
statute
governing
non-medical
malpractice
actions,
governed.
we
challenge--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--just
the
union.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
that
is
correct.
we
challenge
the
decision
below
on
two
grounds.
first
we
urge
that
the
six-month
period
in
section
10(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
be
the
statute
to
govern
duty
of
fair
representation
suits
against
unions.
second,
in
the
alternative
if
state
law
governs
we
would
urge
that
the
90-day
new
york
statute
governing
suits
to
vacate
arbitration
awards
be
applied
in
the
case
against
the
union
as
it
was
in
the
case
against
the
employer.
let
me
take
our
primary
position,
the
10(b)
issue,
first.
the
starting
point,
we
believe,
is
that
this
duty
of
fair
representation
cause
of
action
is
a
federal
cause
of
action.
it
is
a
creature
of
a
federal
statute.
it
was
implied
from
section
9
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
section
that
confers
exclusive
bargaining
status
upon
majority
unions.
the
question
of
what
statute
of
limitations
governs
a
federal
statute
is
a
federal
question
to
be
determined
by
construing
that
statute.
generally,
where
congress
enacts
an
express
cause
of
action
but
does
not
provide
a
statute
of
limitations,
it
is
a
fair
inference
that
congress
intended
that
a
state
limitations
period
would
apply.
that
is
so
because
in
the
normal
case
one
presumes
that
congress
intended
there
be
some
limitations
period
and
the
state
law
in
most
cases
provides
the
most
likely
if
not
the
only
source
for
such
a
statute.
but
we
submit
that
in
that
case
that
inference
makes
no
sense.
as
both
justice
stevens
and
justice
stewart
in
their
respective
opinions
in
mitchell,
the
congress
in
1947
when
it
enacted
the
nlra
was
not
aware
that
this
court
would
come
along
later
and
imply
a
judicial
duty
of
fair
representation
cause
of
action.
in
that
circumstance,
the
silence
of
congress
on
the
statute
of
limitations
question
cannot
signify
an
intent
that
state
law
apply.
it
cannot
signify
an
intent
that
any
particular
statute
of
limitations
apply.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
i
think
it
is
both
of
those.
well,
what
happened
is
i
think
you
had...
in
the
outset
i
think
the
question
was
what
is
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
only
place
to
turn
was
state
law.
over
time
i
think
you
had
that
factor
combined
with
the
factor
that
this
court
had
been
consistently
saying
state
statutes
of
limitations
should
govern
and,
therefore,
when
congress
did
not
put
a
statute
in
there
that
added
weight
to
that
inference.
but
you
cannot
have
an
inference
if
congress
was
not
aware
at
the
time
it
was
creating
the
cause
of
action.
that
is
the
circumstance
we
find
ourselves
in
here,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
that
circumstance
what
you
have
got
to
do
is
you
have
got
to
go
back
to
the
act
and
look
at
the
structure
and
policy
of
the
act,
the
act
that
gives
rise
to
the
cause
of
action.
it
is
our
view
that
when
you
do
that
here
you
get
substantial
guidance
on
this
question
because
in
section
10(b)
of
that
very
act
congress
expressly
adopted
a
limitations
period
that
strikes
a
balance
between
the
very
same
complex
of
employee,
employer,
and
union
rights
that
is
involved
in
the
judicial
duty
of
fair
representation
action.
as
this
court
found
in
machinists,
10(b)
reflects
congress'
judgment
as
to
the
proper
balance
between
the
interests
of
employees
and
the
overriding
interest
of
the
act
and
industrial
peace.
in
the
court's
word
the
objective
of
10(b)
was
stability
of
bargaining
relationships.
that
very
same
tension
exists
in
the
duty
of
fair
representation
context,
the
tension
between
individual
rights
and
the
functioning
of
the
private
system
of
decision
making
that
the
nlra
was
intended
to
foster.
as
this
court
recognized
in
mitchell,
the
grievance
arbitration
process
is
a
critical
part
of
that
private
decision
making
system.
unlike
in
the
commercial
context
where
arbitration
is
a
substitute
for
litigation,
in
the
labor
context
arbitration
serves
as
a
continuing
process
by
which
the
law
of
the
shop
is
developed.
the
duty
of
fair
representation
action
is
a
challenge
to
a
decision
arrived
at
through
that
process,
a
decision
that
the
parties
to
that
process,
the
union
and
the
employer,
are
perfectly
prepared
to
live
by.
the
thrust
of
duty
of
fair
representation
action
is
that
that
system
of
decision
making
malfunctions.
as
long
as
the
duty
of
fair
representation
suit
may
be
brought,
the
parties
cannot
regard
the
matter
as
finally
settled,
and
they
cannot
rely
on
it
in
their
future
dealings
with
one
another.
the
court
expressed
this
point
in
mitchell
and
if
i
may
quote
from
the
court's
opinion,
"this
system
with
its
heavy
emphasis
on
grievance,
arbitration
and
the
law
of
the
shop
could
easily
become
unworkable
if
a
decision
which
is
given
meaning
and
content
to
the
terms
of
an
agreement
that
even
effected
subsequent
modifications
of
the
agreement
could
certainly
be
called
into
question
as
much
as
six
years
later.
"
the
court
went
on
to
point
to
the
"undesirability
of
the
results
of
the
grievance
and
arbitral
process
being
suspended
in
limbo
for
long
periods.
"
the
six-month
period
in
10(b)
was
intended
to
provide
a
definitive
end
to
just
such
situations
of
uncertainty.
it
is
our
view
in
sum
as
to
the
10(b)
issue
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
an
intrical
part
of
the
complex
of
employee,
union,
and
employer
rights
embodied
in
the
national
labor
policy.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
we
do,
your
honor.
we
don't
think
necessarily
that
10(b)
applies
against
the
union
necessarily
compels
that
answer
but
we
do
believe
that
is
the
correct
answer.
we
do
so
for
the
following
reason.
the
reason
we
say
it
is
a
different
question
is
you
have
got
to
get
at
it...
you
obviously
do
not
have
an
action
arising
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
against
the
employer.
you
have
got
a
301
action
and
you
have
got
in
301
a
provision
where
congress
enacted
a
cause
of
action
and
did
not
expressly
enact
a
statute
of
limitations.
however,
we
believe
that
the
hoosier
cardinal
decision
provides
ample
reason
and
justification
for
saying
that
in
the
case
against
the
employer
as
well
as
the
case
against
the
union
these
consensual
processes
of
private
decision
making
are
implicated.
the
court
in
hoosier
seems
to
have
left
room
for
saying
that
when
a
301
cause
of
action
does
possibly
threaten
those
processes
that
some
other
source
in
state
law
might
be
looked
to.
in
this
case
we
think
10(b)
in
that
context
also.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
there
is
no
question
that
hoosier
is
authority
for
the
proposition...
it
seems
to
me
you
got
hysteric
when
you
got
a
301
action
with
hoosier.
with
respect
to
the
case
against
the
union,
we
do
not
consider
that
a
301
action.
at
the
very
least
the
cause
of
action
is
implied
not
from
301
but
from
section
9
of
the
nlra.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
well,
humphrey
cited
tunstall
which
said
the
action...
excuse
me
in
humphrey--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--no,
excuse
me.
i
was
mixing
up.
the
action
was--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--yes.
the
cause
of
action
against
the
union
was
derived
where
it
has
always
been
derived
from
and
that
is
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
believe
the
court
was
saying
in
humphrey
that
the
claim...
that
there
was
a
breach
of
contract
in
that
case.
in
fact,
it
was
a
claim
that
both
the
employer
and
the
union
had
breached
the
contract.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
was
a
301
claim.
i
do
not
think
it
was
saying
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
claim
was
a
301
claim,
certainly
not
that
it
was
derived
from
301
as
opposed
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
sum,
on
the
10(b)
we
think
the
balance
struck
by
congress
in
1947
in
enacting
10(b)
is
the
one
that
best
effectuates
congress'
intent
here
when
dealing
with
the
conflicts
of
interest
not
the
varying
laws
of
50
states,
none
of
which
was
devised
with
this
particular
set
of
interest
in
mind.
if
the
court
please,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
i
am
going
to
take
that
much.
i
just
have
two
quick
points.
first,
hoosier
was
a
straight
breach
of
contract
action
under
section
301.
it
was
not
an
action
derived
from
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
this
one
is.
i
do
not
think
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that
what
we
are
asking
for
is
judicial
inventiveness
and
that
what
the
other
side
is
asking
for
is
something
other
than
that.
what
we
are
saying
is
when
you
look
at
this
statute
and
you
look
at
the
complex
of
interest
involved,
congress
adopted
a
statute
of
limitations
to
apply
to
that
complex
of
interest.
it
is
not
judicial
inventiveness
to
say
let's
apply
that
statute
rather
than
the
statutes
of
50
states
all
of
which
are
different
none
of
which
was
devised
to
apply
to
this
set
of
interest.
let
me
make
one
point--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--well,
permitted
would
be
a
very
strong
word,
justice
white.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
if
we
properly
understand--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--no,
we
are
not
saying,
i
want
to
be
very
clear
on
this,
that
congress
expressly
provided
this
statute
of
limitations
for
this
kind
of
law
suit
because
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset
we--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--okay.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
looking
at
the
statute
and
the
statute
of
limitations
that
was
adopted
we
think
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
there
is
what
it
would
have
tried
to
achieve
here.
the
same
complex
of
interest
is
involved.
let
me
make
one
point
on
the
state
law
issue
where
it
is
our
position
that
if
we
get
to
the
issue,
the
arbitration
statute
should
apply.
the
court
in
mitchell
said
the
malpractice
analogy
was
inappropriate
in
that
case
because
the
arbitrator's
award
stood
between
the
plaintiffs
and
the
remedy
they
sought.
that
is
true
as
well
in
the
case
of
the
union.
as
counsel
for
respondents
indicated,
they
have
to
prove
that
there
was
a
breach
of
contract
and
the
remedy
they
seek,
a
remedy
under
bowen,
is
a
remedy
of
back
wages
which
flows
from
a
breach
of
contract.
just
as
in
the
case
against
the
employer,
it
is
necessary
here
if
they
want
to
make
out
their
claim
to
prove
that
the
contract
was
breached
which
means
you
have
got
to
show
that
the
arbitrator's
decision
was
erroneous.
thank
you,
your
honor.
