mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
we
were
discussing
this
problem
in
an
academic
nature,
the
10(b)
feature
might
be
a
valid
discussion,
but
we
are
discussing
it
in
a
legal
nature
on
appeal
from
a
district
court
to
a
court
of
appeals
and
we
are
here
on
legal
questions.
we
cannot
waive
out
of
existence
the
fact
that
we
are
governed
by
hoosier
cardinal,
that
we
are
governed
by
mitchell
and
that
we
are
governed
by
the
rules
of
decision
act.
the
rules
of
decision
act
compel
us
to
go
to
state
law,
the
most
analogous
arbitration
statute
and
if
we
do
that
that
then
becomes
federal
law.
it
does
not
erase
the
federal
question.
the
rules
of
decision
act
require
the
courts
by
virtue
of
an
act
of
court
to
go
to
state
law
and
find
what
may
be
required
or
provided
in
civil
actions
in
state
law
and
apply
it
to
the
federal
cause
of
action
in
a
federal
court.
ten
(b)
is
an
administrative
provision
in
the
national
labor
act
that
begins
the
procedure
for
the
national
labor
relations
board.
you
are
beginning
a
process
with
10(b)
whereas
with
the
arbitration
that
we
are
talking
about
here
we
are
concluding
a
process
under
a
labor
contract
between
a
union
and
an
employer.
if
we
were
to
compare
this
on
a
same
parallel
track,
we
would
have
to
regard
the
beginning
of
the
grievance
with
the
beginning
of
the
initiation
of
a
problem
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
run
those
two
parallel
to
the
time
of
the
arbitration
hearing
to
the
time
of
a
hearing
before
an
administrative
law
judge
with
the
labor
board
and
then
determine
what
time
elements
apply
from
those
two
equal
hearings.
in
other
words,
you
cannot
reach
over
and
take
10(b)
that
begins
a
process
and
apply
that
to
an
arbitration
wherein
a
process
is
ended.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
want
to
be
analogous
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
an
appeal
from
an
administrative
law
judge
to
the
full
board,
they
only
give
you
20
days.
we
cannot
agree
with
the
statement
of
facts
made
by
counsel
for
del
costello.
i
am
not
going
to
belabor
them
here
because
they
are
set
out
in
detail
in
the
briefs,
but
i
want
to
point
one
thing
out
to
this
court
and
that
is
that
the
arbitration
statute
in
maryland
is
exempted
from
applying
to
labor
management
contracts
specifically
by
maryland
rule
of
practice
e2
wherein
it
is
provided
in
any
such
case
the
provisions
of
the
maryland
arbitration
act
concerning
such
proceedings
shall
be
applicable.
in
there
they
refer
to
court
proceedings.
the
courts
specifically
refer
that
the
arbitration
act
will
apply.
the
employer
does
not
get
his
rights
from
the
implied
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
if
you
want
to
imply
anything
and
if
you
imply
that
the
conduct
of
arbitrary
or
unreasonable
union
conduct
towards
an
employee
is
implied
from
the
act,
you
have
to
weigh
that
against
what
the
act
specifically
says.
the
employer
is
not
part
of
that
implication,
but
the
employer
is
inextricably
interdependent
with
the
union
when
these
cases
come
before
the
district
court.
they
are
like
love
and
marriage.
they
go
hand
in
hand.
it
is
probably
the
only
time
that
they
have
anything
in
common
and
that
is
to
preserve
the
arbitral
process
in
the
labor
agreement.
if
there
is
any
unfair
representation,
that
representation
would
occur
either
before
or
during
the
arbitral
hearing.
if
there
is
an
appeal
to
a
district
court,
it
is
an
appeal
from
that
arbitration
that
we
are
talking
about.
the
union's
conduct
is
not
indepedent
of
the
employer,
and
it
can't
be
predicated
upon
an
indepedent
action.
it
is
all
in
one
lawsuit.
as
a
result,
one
statute
of
limitations
ought
to
apply
to
the
two
of
them.
then
they
raise
the
question
of
whether
it
is
prospective
only
or
prospective
and
retrospective.
all
law
is
prospective
and
retrospective
unless
this
court
says
otherwise.
in
northern
pipeline
it
saw
fit
to
make
the
law
prospective
because
of
the
havoc
that
would
be
created
in
the
event
the
law
was
retrospective.
but
in
mitchell
it
did
not
see
any
need
for
that.
it
said
nothing
about
the
law
being
prospective
only,
and
as
a
result,
it
is
also
applied
retrospectively
unless
the
chevron
criteria
applied,
a
clean
break
with
the
past,
no
foreshadowing
of
what
is
to
come.
nobody
can
claim
there
was
not
any
foreshadowing
in
mitchell
after
reading
hines
plus
a
multiple
of
lower
court
decisions
that
existed
long
before
hines
that
applied
a
local
arbitration
statute.
this
business
about
not
being
able
to
get
a
lawyer
or
that
the
lawyers
are
polarized
in
baltimore,
none
of
this
is
a
matter
of
record.
none
of
it
appears
in
this
case.
these
are
subjective
things
that
courts
cannot
concern
themselves
with.
we
have
to
concern
ourselves
with
the
reality
of
the
situation
and
what
the
law
consists
of.
the
law
says
you
must
refer
to
the
appropriate
analogous
state
statute
and
if
you
have
one
that
provides
for
a
limitation
on
arbitrations
and
arbitration
is
what
we
are
dealing
with,
then
you
must
invoke
that
statute.
if
you
invoke
that
statute
in
order
to
be
completely
fair
and
to
conclude
this
arbitral
process
somewhere
along
the
line
you
must
apply
it
equal
to
the
employer
and
to
the
union.
