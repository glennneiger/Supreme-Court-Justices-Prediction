mr.
william
h.
zinman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
should
this
court
apply
the
maryland
arbitral
statute
of
30
days
or
the
six-month
statute
of
limitations
contained
in
10(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
a
longer
statute
of
limitations
to
this
hybrid
action.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
applies
the
maryland
arbitral
statute
to
this
hybrid
action,
the
next
issue
would
be
whether
or
not
it
should
be
applied
prospectively
or
retrospectively
in
this
case.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
as
follows:
philip
del
costello,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
was
employed
by
anchor
motor
freight,
the
respondent,
as
an
over-the-road
truck
driver
at
the
time
of
his
termination
on
june
27,
1977.
at
that
time
he
was
also
a
dissident
member
of
prod,
a
national
teamsters
organization
and
was
engaged
in
a
campaign
of
truck
safety
several
months
proceeding
his
termination.
on
that
date
he
was
assigned
to
drive
a
truck
from
baltimore
to
canada
and
during
the
course
of
his
inspections
he
found
a
number
of
safety
defects
with
respect
to
the
truck.
when
the
company
insisted
that
he
drive
the
truck
he
refused,
and
he
was
terminated
on
the
spot.
consistent
with
the
company
union
contract,
he
initiated
a
grievance
at
that
time
which
was
not
resolved
amicably.
as
a
result,
the
grievance
took
the
form
of
a
hearing
before
a
committee
consisting
of
an
equal
number
of
employer
and
union
representatives.
i
believe
this
was
in
july
of
1977.
at
that
time
he
was
represented
by
his
business
agent
who
is
his
exclusive
representative.
he
did
not
have
the
right
to
an
attorney.
the
business
agent
conducted
no
investigation
into
the
facts
which
preceded
the
termination,
nor
did
the
business
agent
introduce
any
evidence
and
particularly
it
failed
to
introduce
the
mechanic
who
supported
mr.
del
costello's
position
that
the
truck
was
unsafe.
the
only
evidence
that
was
introduced
was
through
a
company
supervisor
at
that
time
who
mr.
del
costello
claimed
was
not
even
there.
this
was
contrary
to
the
conference
rules
and
if
that
evidence
was
excluded,
of
course,
the
company
would
not
have
met
its
burden
of
proof.
mr.
del
costello
related
to
his
business
agent
that
this
man
was
not
even
there.
the
business
agent
failed
to
object.
as
a
result
of
this
hearing,
the
committee
upheld
the
discharge.
subsequent
to
that
the
business
agent
engaged
in
a
course
of
conduct
which
reasonably
led
mr.
del
costello
to
believe
that
he
had
yet
to
exhaust
his
contract
remedies
and
that
the
decision
was
not
final
until
december
of
1977.
several
months
thereafter,
i
believe
it
was
in
march
of
1978,
mr.
del
costello
initiated
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland.
several
months
thereafter
both
respondents
answered
the
suit.
however,
local
557
never
even
raised
the
issue
of
limitations
in
its
answer.
while
anchor
motor
freight
did
raise
the
question
of
limitations
it
did
not
specify
which
limitation
period
it
had
mind.
this
was
understandable
at
that
time
because
the
maryland
arbitral
statute
by
its
own
terms
is
expressly
inapplicable
to
labor
disputes.
in
any
event,
for
the
next
32
months
during
which
time
the
parties
engaged
in
rather
extensive
discovery,
not
one
time
did
anchor
motor
freight
or
local
557
ever
raise
the
question
of
limitations
until
they
filed
their
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
november
of
1980,
one
month
after
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
mitchell.
we
contend
that
if
this
court
applies
the
arbitral
limitation
statute
of
30
days
for
all
intents
and
purposes
the
hybrid
cause
of
action
is
destroyed.
i
say
that
because
most
of
these
arbitration
statutes
were
initially
passed
by
the
state
legislatures
to
apply
to
commercial
disputes
and
in
commercial
disputes
from
the
arbitrator
to
the
courts
the
parties
are
usually
represented
by
the
same
counsel.
and
it
is
a
matter
of
smoothly
shifting
gears
from
the
arbitrator
to
the
court
in
terms
of
the
filing
of
appeal
which
in
that
instance
only
takes
hours
to
possibly
one
day.
the
situation
is
entirely
different
with
a
disconnected
party
such
as
mr.
del
costello
or
anyone
having
hybrid
cause
of
action
because
he
does
not
have
an
attorney
at
the
grievance
procedure.
he
is
limited,
and
in
this
case
he
was
limited
exclusively
to
his
representative,
his
union
representative.
moreover,
unlike
the
arbitral
proceeding
where
there
is
an
established
and
known
record
of
law
and
fact,
the
facts
surrounding
the
malpractice
not
only
are
not
on
the
record
but
the
business
agent
in
most
instances
does
everything
to
hide
those
facts.
as
a
consequence,
before
the
worker
ever
realizes
that
he
has
a
cause
of
action,
30
days
has
already
passed
and
he
is
out
of
court.
but
that
is
not
the
end
of
it.
who
does
he
turn
when
he
first
realizes
that
he
has
been
wronged.
he
has
to
go
to
a
lawyer
and
unfortunately
those
most
able
to
represent
him
in
this
field
are
either
labor
lawyers
representing
management
or
labor
lawyers
representing
unions
and
due
to
the
polarization
of
the
labor
bar
he
ultimately
finds
that
he
has
to
turn
to
a
general
practitioner
such
as
he
did
in
this
case--
mr.
william
h.
zinman
--no,
your
honor,
i
am
simply
saying
that
as
a
practical
matter
particularly
even
in
a
larger
city
such
as
baltimore
lawyers
who
represent
unions
and
lawyers
who
represent
companies
will
not
take
these
cases
because
they
view
the
petitioner
as
somewhat
of
a
pariah.
in
a
broad
sense
i
suggest
it
might
well
be
a
self-perceived
conflict
of
interest
or
rather
technical
conflict
of
interest.
in
any
case
when
a
general
practitioner
gets
this
kind
of
client
he
has
to
research
a
brand
new
law
and
that
takes
time.
after
he
researches
the
law
and
then
familiarizes
himself
not
only
with
that
but
with
the
customs
and
the
practices
and
the
contracts
and
the
constitutions
and
all
of
the
other
intricate
matters,
he
then
has
to
decide
to
conduct
a
factual
investigation
to
determine
frankly
whether
or
not
there
is
a
prima
facie
case.
that
takes
a
considerable
period
of
time.
after
all
of
that
is
done
there
is
a
matter
of
counsel
fees
and
costs
because
you
must
have
reasonable
cost
in
this
case
to
meet
the
well-dealed
opponents
who
have
no
such
problems.
so
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
important
reasons
why
it
is
totally
unfair
to
apply
such
a
short
statute
of
limitations
of
even
30,
60
or
90
days.
in
fact
to
be
perfectly
candid,
i
believe
that
even
six
months
under
these
very
difficult
circumstances
is
not
enough.
the
unions
and
companies
frequently
make
the
argument
if
any
period
of
time
longer
than
30
days
is
applied
it
will
do
violence
to
the
policy
of
rapid
disposition
of
labor
disputes
which,
of
course,
was
the
principle
enunciated
in
the
mitchell
case
several
years
ago,
and
i
suggest
that
this
is
not
correct.
it
is
not
correct
for
two
reasons.
first,
in
mitchell
this
court
only
had
really
two
options.
it
had
the
option
to
select
a
three
or
five
year
statute
of
limitations
on
one
hand
or
a
90-day
limitation
on
the
other.
it
did
not,
as
i
read
the
case,
have
the
option
of
applying
the
six-month
arbitral
limitation
period
contained
in
10(b)
as
it
does
here.
but
more
important
than
that,
i
really
do
not
believe
that
there
is
an
empirical
evidence
to
suggest
that
there
is
any
danger
posed
to
the
notion
of
rapid
disposition
or
more
particularly
the
law
of
the
shop,
based
upon
the
fact
that
if
the
statistics
in
the
cert
petition
of
the
steelworkers
is
any
indication
that
there
is
any
avalanche
of
cases
now
pending
before
the
district
courts.
they
had
110,
but
assuming
that
there
is
400
cases
now
pending
before
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states,
how
does
that
pose
as
a
threat
to
rapid
resolution
of
labor
disputes.
moreover,
i
will
just
close...
moreover,
most
of
these
cases
that
are
pending
involve
questions
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
the
agent
properly
investigated
the
case
of
whether
or
not
he
was
guilty
of
committing
an
act
of
malice.
there
are
very
few
precedential
cases
in
the
whole
scope
of
these
cases
that
are
now
pending,
and
given
the
high
degree
of
proof
that
is
required
to
prove
one
of
these
cases,
i
doubt
very
much
if
there
is
any
particular
threat
to
this
policy.
so
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
most
appropriate
statute
of
limitations
would
be
10(b).
in
my
remaining
time
i
would
just
submit
that
the
closest
analogous
limitation
period
would
be
10(b)
because
10(b)
in
breach
of
duty
of
fair
representation
which
was
contained
within
the
hybrid
cause
of
action
was
judicially
implicated
from
the
national
labor
relations
act.
as
such
the
courts
have
held
on
many
occasions
that
a
breach
of
duty
of
fair
representation
is
also
an
unfair
labor
practice
as
is
the
conduct
of
the
company
in
many
cases.
but
to
the
extent
that
it
is
not
i
refer
the
court
to
the
observation
of
justice
stewart
that
it
is
sufficiently
similar
in
character
so
as
to
be
encompassed
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
william
h.
zinman
yes.
in
this
particular
case
we
do.
mr.
william
h.
zinman
yes,
but
we
feel,
your
honor,
that
that
is
a
factual
matter
to
be
resolved
by
the
trier
of
fact.
we
filed
an
affidavit
alleging
those
facts
and,
of
course,
neither
respondent
answered.
they
are
asking
this
court
for
the
first
time
to
decide
facts
which
is
really
not
before
the
court.
we
assume
that
the
court
will
apply
the
usual
rule
of
construction
of
assuming
the
truth
or
any
truthful
instances
that
arise
out
of
our
contentions.
mr.
william
h.
zinman
pardon?
mr.
william
h.
zinman
yes,
sir.
it
was
on
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
that
is
the
posture
of
the
case
at
the
present
time
so
that
all
this
court
would
do
obviously
is
return
the
case
to
the
district
court
on
remand
if
it
found
in
our
favor.
finally,
i
would
just
conclude
by
stating
that
we
feel
also
that
if
the
court
does
decide
that
the
arbitral
limitations
is
applicable
that
we
suggest
that
it
should
be
held
prospectively
rather
than
retrospectively
because
there
was
a
reasonable
reliance
and
the
best
evidence
of
our
reasonable
reliance
is
the
conduct
of
the
respondents
in
not
raising
this
question
of
limitations
for
32
months.
thank
you.
