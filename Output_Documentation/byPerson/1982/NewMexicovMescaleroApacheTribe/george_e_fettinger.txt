mr.
george
e.
fettinger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
discussing
here
today
a
value
generated
on
an
indian
reservation.
the
mescalero
apache
tribe,
for
example,
imported
the
elk.
it
nurtured
them.
it
protected
them.
it
abstained
from
harvesting
them
for
a
long
period
of
time,
and
it
now
has
a
herd
of
elk
that
can
supplement
a
complete
tourism
development
program
on
the
reservation.
the
inn
of
the
mountain
gods
is
a
fine
resort,
part
of
which
is
there
to
assist
non-indian
hunters,
most
of
whom
are
from
outside
the
state
of
new
mexico,
in
their
endeavors
to
hunt
and
to
fish
on
that
reservation.
why
did
the
tribe
do
this?
they
did
it
to
protect
the
resource,
quite
obviously.
in
this
particular
case
we
had
an
additional
reason
for
doing
this
and
that
was
to
maximize
the
economic
yield
to
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
of
their
whole
tourism
program,
and
in
order
to
provide
income
for
governmental
and
other
economic
development
purposes
on
the
reservation.
this
is
not
an
attempt
to
market
anything
resembling
a
tax
break
because
we
are
selling
cigarettes
on
that
reservation.
very
simply,
the
quality
of
the
product
that
is
being
provided
by
the
tribe
in
this
case
far
exceeds
anything
that
is
available
anyplace
else
in
the
area.
the
facility
is
better
than
anything
else
in
the
state,
and
there
is
no
contest
on
that.
the
reason
people
pay--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--no,
sir,
but
the
reason
people
will
pay
substantial
money
for
a
package
hunt
on
the
mescalero
indian
reservation
is
because
it
all
fits
together.
it
is
a
complete
package.
even
if
it
were
not,
the
value
of
the
elk
on
that
reservation
are
a
product
of
the
tribe,
not
a
product
of
any
state
activity,
and
it
is
because
we
can
provide
trophy
elk
hunting
on
the
reservation
with
guides,
circumstances
that
hunters
find
better
than
any
place
else.
it
is
that
reason
that
this
particular
enterprise
has
been
economically
successful,
and
in
this
particular
instance
we
are
talking
about
the
elk.
that
is
not
the
only
issue
in
the
case.
back
in
1966
we,
in
fact,
had
13
elk
in
the
vicinity
of
the
reservation.
it
was
because
of
tribal
activity
that
we
subsequently
imported
in
1966-67
about
162
elk
from
wyoming,
and
it
is
true
that
the
state
of
new
mexico
gave
us
a
permit
to
import
those
elk
into
the
state.
the
record
does
not
reflect
any
substantial
additional
involvement
by
the
state
of
new
mexico
in
the
development
of
that
herd.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that,
on
the
record,
11
years
later
we
had
in
excess
of
1,200
elk
on
the
reservation.
i
might
point
out
to
this
court
that
we
have
a
herd
of
cattle
in
the
neighborhood
of
6,000
head
on
the
reservation.
we
have
obviously
permitted
the
elk
to
graze
in
the
same
area
that
could
otherwise
be
occupied
by
our
cattle.
quite
obviously,
significant
range
development
has
occurred.
we
have
not
reduced
the
herd
of
the
tribe
during
the
intervening
period,
and
that
is
an
economic
decision.
that
is
forebearance
on
the
part
of
the
tribe
in
raising
cattle
on
the
reservation
in
order
to
develop
this
herd
of
elk
for
other
purposes
to
supplement
as
an
economic
enterprise
on
the
reservation
a
total
tourism
development
program.
incidentally,
the
state
of
new
mexico
in
this
case
benefits
from
the
activities
of
the
tribe.
the
elks,
we
cannot
keep
all
of
them
on
the
reservation
as
much
as
we
would
like
to,
and
in
fact
the
hunting
has
been
enhanced
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
reservation
to
the
benefit
of
non-indian
hunters
who
hunt
off
of
the
reservation.
that,
i
think,
makes
us
significantly
different
than
essentially
any
other
case
than
we
have
had
before
this
court.
one
other
item
i
would
like
to
point
out--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
reservation
is
one,
mountainous
terrain
to
begin
with.
it
is
not
flat.
it
is
essentially
fully
fenced.
there
is
one
area
that
goes
up
sierra
blanca
mountain,
that
mountain
being
12,004
feet
high,
there
is
some
portion
of
that
because
the
reservation
line
runs
just
a
few
feet
to
the
side
of
the
peak.
but
other
than
that
the
reservation
is
essentially
fully
fenced,
and
we
do
have
signs
that
indicate
this.
we
have
made
a
conscientious
effort
to
notify
hunters
when
they
are
on
the
reservation
and
when
they
leave
the
reservation.
incidentally,
i
might--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--unfortuntely,
we
would
have
to
concede
that
our
elk
are
perfectly
healthy
and
well
able
to
go
over
a
four
strand
barbed
wire
fence
in
one
bound.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
hopefully
not
through
it.
it
tends
to
damage
the
merchandise
a
little
bit,
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
they
do
go
through
it,
and
we
have
seen
that
unfortunately
happen,
but,
in
fact,
most
of
them--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--no,
sir.
i
think
our
range
conservationists,
and
i
think
generally
the
facts
of
this
case...
although
in
answering
your
question
i
will
go
beyond
the
facts
of
the
case...
we
do
have
adequate
winter
and
summer
range
on
the
reservation
to
accommodate
this
herd.
however,
the
nature
of
the
animal
is
that
the
grass
is
always
greener.
they
do
go
over
the
fence,
and
they
are
hunted
over
the
fence.
there
is
no
question
of
that.
but
we
are
not
talking
about
owning
these
animals
on
that
reservation,
and
frankly
we--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--several--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--no,
sir.
the
state
has
a
habit
of
raising
their
licensing
fees
just
like
the
tribe
does,
incidentally.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir.
generally
speaking--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--it
runs
about
$200
plus...
no,
it
went
from
$300
to
$500
with
the
last
session
of
the
legislature,
i
believe,
on
some
of
the
exotic
animals.
i
have--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--elk,
i
believe,
is
in
the
$250
range.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
mr.
justice
white,
it
is
not
just
a
matter
of
the
economics.
as
justice
o'connor
was
pointing
out,
we
have,
for
example,
four
different
seasons
during
which
you
can
hunt
bull
elk.
the
reason
we
have
four
different
seasons
is
because
we
employ
our
tribal
members
as
conservation
officers,
and
we
wish
to
use
them
more
efficiently.
we
employ
part-time
many
of
the
tribal
members
to
provide
access
control--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--sir?
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
we
are
doing
very
well
at
controlling
the
number
of
elk.
they
are
multiplying
very
rapidly.
the
herd
is
very
healthy,
and
we
have
an
adequate
stock--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--we
could
have
too
many
elk,
i
presume,
but
they
conceive
that
our
game
management
is
workmanlike
at
worst
case,
so
that
we
do
not
have
that
problem.
but
to
answer
your
question
on
the--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--they
have
a
season
that
they
suggest
to
us
by
their
lawsuit
that
we
must--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--yes,
sir.
they
have
enforced
their...
when
the
state
says
they
have
enforced
their
laws
and
regulations
since
1969
as
regards
the
reservation
they
mean
that
they
have
accosted
our
hunters
once
they
leave
the
reservation,
and
they
have
been--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--no,
sir.
they
arrested
them
when
having
one
elk,
on
the
theory
they
did
not
have
a
new
mexico
license
at
the
time,
and
they
have
on
one
occasion
stopped
a
rental
vehicle
operated
by
the
tribe
with
elk
meat
frozen
in
the
back
in
order
to
check
the
names
to
see
that
everybody
had
the
appropriate
licenses
from
the
state.
that
is
what
started
this
lawsuit.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
four
hundred
sixty
thousand
acres,
which
is--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--four
hundred
sixty
thousand
acres.
it
is
essentially--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--i
have
never
worked
it
out
in
terms
of
square
miles,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--can
we
do
our
arithmetic
later?
[laughter]
the
fact
is
that
there
is
only
one
tract
of
160
acres
within
that
that
is
privately
owned
and
that
is
over
on
the
side
of
the
mountain.
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
24
other
acres.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
not
very
many.
most
of
the
non-tribal
members
are
themselves
indians
because
they
are
employees
of
the
bia.
there
is
only
14.4
acres
that
is
privately
owned
within
the
reservation
today,
and
there
are
a
few
non-indians
within
that
group
but
not
very
many.
they
are
not
a
problem.
they
are
not
pertinent
to
the
case.
there
is
no
significant
number.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
no,
sir.
if
i
might
suggest
to
the
court
that
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
state
has
stipulated
that
the
tribe
has
a
workmanlike
program
for
the
protection
of
game
animals
is
significant
to
this
case.
it
is
something
that
has
been
absent
in
other
cases,
and
i
would
suggest
that
perhaps
the
existence
of--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--i
might
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
court
has
already
said
that
the
species,
perhaps,
is
pertinent,
and
you
cannot
chase
the
last
steel
head
into
the
net
theory
might
be
applicable
to
this
sort
of
a
case
dealing
with
an
indian
reservation.
if,
in
fact,
you
have
a
comprehensive
game
program
and
it
is
working,
then
why
does
the
state
need
to
have
jurisdiction
over
the
reservation?
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
no,
sir.
there
are
many
points
that
have
been
covered
in
regard
to
both
preemption
and
in
the
interference
with
tribal
government.
both
of
those
series
of
arguments
carry
in
this
particular
case
because
you
are
talking
about
the
management
of
the
range
land
on
the
reservation
itself.
you
are
talking
about
substituting
game
animals
for
cattle,
for
example.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
we
do
not
equate
this
case
to
the
gambling
situation
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
there
is
also
a
federal
statute
that
makes
it,
i
believe,
a
federal
felony
to
possess
a
gaming
device
in
indian
country
which
is
not
ordinarily
considered
to
be--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--unfortunately,
i
think
this
court
has
generally
said
that
those
items
are
treated
independently.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
jurisdiction
of
a
tribe
should
be
related
more
to
its
territory
when,
in
fact,
that
theory
can
be
reasonably
applied.
i
do
not
suggest
it
where
you
have
28
percent
trust
land
and
72
percent
non-trust
land
that
that
can
be
applied.
but
i
would
suggest
that
where
you
have
essentially
all
of
the
reservation
being
trust
land
that
the
territory
of
the
tribe
when
it
has
an
operative
government
operating
under,
in
our
case,
the
indian
reorganization
act
with
ordinances,
with
a
superintendent,
with
a
budget
approved
by
the
federal
government,
with
an
annual
ordinance
that
is
approved
by
the
authorized
representative
of
the
secretary
of
interior
and
carries
down
to
the
detail
of
the
weight
of
the
bullet,
the
area
in
which
you
will
hunt,
the
price
of--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--it
is
difficult
to
separate
them
because
the
language
even
of
this
court
is
that
you--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--will
lose
against
the
backdrop
of
tribal
sovereignty.
we
like
the
tenth
circuit
opinion,
obviously.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
in
answer
to
your
question,
we
would
tend
to
say
we
agree
with
the
tenth
circuit
opinion
and
that
is
a
simple
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
that
is
not
all
we
have
to
help
you
with.
we
would
suggest
to
you
that
tribal
sovereignty
is
a
basic
premise.
there
are
many
pitfalls
built
into
the
preemption
theory,
for
example,
of
this
court.
how...
are
you
not
to
permit
an
indian
tribe
to
be
successful?
preemption
implies
that
the
indian
tribe
must
of
necessity
go
back
to
the
united
states
government
to
have
them
draft
a
contract
on
a
timber
case,
to
have
them
go
out
and
supervise
the
cutting.
how
can
you
reconcile
that
with
the
economic
development
plans
of
congress
in
regard
to
indian
reservations
and
self-determination?
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
well,
one,
i
would
suggest,
please,
we
are
not
selling
hunting
licenses
at
cut
rate
prices--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--our
license
packages
run
as
high
today...
on
the
record
in
1967
were
under
$2,000
per
elk
with
a
package
hunt,
$800
plus
without
the
package.
in
today's
world,
you
are
talking
about
substantially
more
than
that.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
well,
we
have
a
package
hunt
that
includes
the
room,
the
meals--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--yes.
we
do.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
roughly,
on
the
record,
it
is
approximately
$800.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
that
is
in
1967.
it
has
gone
up
from
there.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
that
is
the
prime.
that
is
the
bull
elk.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
no.
licenses
are
per
species
and
there
are
separate
seasons
and
in
backing
to
the
question
regarding
how
does
that
interfere...
how
does
state
regulation
interfere--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--yes,
sir.
now
more,
substantially
more.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
well,
the
period
of
time
during
which
you
can
hunt
is
not
limited
to
one
day.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
yes,
sir,
and
we
do
not
have
too
much
difficulty
selling
those
permits.
now,
i
assume
the
state
is
going
to
point
out
that
we
do
not
have
that
difficulty,
but
that
is
up
to
the
tribe
to
manage
that.
a
moment
ago
the
question
was
asked
how
does
the
state
regulation
interfere
with
tribal
activity,
and
there
are
many
different
ways
that
they
do
this.
we
schedule
the
hunts
over
different
periods
of
time
to
supplement
the
business
at
the
inn
of
the
mountain
gods.
we
prefer
for
hunter
safety
reasons
to
have
fewer
hunters
on
the
reservation.
we
prefer
to
control
the
access
to
the
particular
area.
we
hire
part
time
tribal
employees
for
assistance
to
the
conservation
officers
during
the
hunt.
we
prefer
to
have
all
of
our
conservation
officers
concentrating
on
one
species
in
one
area.
that
is
all
good
management.
we
have
seven
full
time
conservation
officers
on
460,000
acres
of
reservation.
that
is
six
tenths
of
one
percent
of
the
area
of
the
state
of
new
mexico.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
well,
in
this
particular
case,
our
treaty
does
contain,
and
this
is
all
covered
in
our
brief
beginning
at
about
page
roughly
20
or
22,
the
treaty
that
the
mescalero
apaches
have
provides
the
wording
that
we
are
under
the
exclusive
control
of
the
united
states
government.
the
enabling
act
in
the
constitution
of
the
state
new
mexico
contains
the
conventional
disclaimer.
we
also
have
public
law
280
that
recites
that
even
in
a
public
law
280
state
you
do
not
have
the
right
to
interfere
with
the
rights
of
the
indians
in
regard
to
the
control
and
licensing
of
wildlife
on
that
reservation.
our
tribal
constitution
under
the
indian
reorganization
act
provides
specifically
for
the
control
of
wildlife
on
the
reservation.
tribal
ordinance
no.
77-1,
that
is
a
general
hunting
and
fishing
ordinance
on
the
reservation.
we
also
have
the
annual
licensing
ordinance
on
the
reservation
which
spells
out
in
infinite
detail,
more
detail
perhaps
than
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
in
regard
to
hunting
going
down
to
the
weight
of
the
bullet.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
we
have
a
treaty
of
1851.
we
have
an
executive
order
of
1873,
and
we
do
predate
the
state,
which
is
1912
for
statehood.
the
state
first
started
controlling
fish
and
wildlife
in
1895,
so
we
well
predate
the
state.
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
we
would
love
to
have
that
be
the
ruling
of
this
court,
of
course,
sir--
mr.
george
e.
fettinger
--yes,
sir.
we
manage...
i
think
the
touchstone
is
that,
yes,
we
manage
the
conservation
program
on
the
reservation
as
well
as
any
of
the
states
do.
we
have
several
other
items
incidentally
as
a
touchstone
for
our
preemption,
and
they
are
listed
in
our
brief.
thank
you.
