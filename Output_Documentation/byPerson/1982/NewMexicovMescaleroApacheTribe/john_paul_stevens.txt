mr.
dunnigan,
it
seems
to
me
there
might
be
two
different
types
of
problems.
one
is
the
substantive
regulation
as
to
how
many
animals
of
different
kinds
you
can
kill
and
the
like
and
another
the
licensing
restriction.
what
is
the
state
interest
in
having
the
right
to
license
people
to
hunt
within
the
reservation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
had
their
own
licensing
system,
which
i
guess
they
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
the
indians
have
their
own
licensing
system
which
i
guess
they
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fettinger,
i
am
interested
in
the
legal
theory
that
supports
your
position.
i
understand
the
equities
of
the
case
as
you
describe
them,
but
would
the
same
principle
apply
if
you
did
a
poor
job
or
just
an
average
job
of
managing
your
game
resources?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
we
had
a
case
in
which
they
agreed
you
handled
the
elk
well,
but
you
did
not
handle
the
antelope
very
well,
say,
or
something
like
that,
that
there
were
some
areas
where
you
were
superb
and
some
areas
in
which
they
regarded
you
as
deficient.
would
the
constitutional
rule
be
that
you
could
regulate
those
where
you
did
a
good
job
but
not
regulate
those
were
you
did
a
poor
job?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
lots
of
times
lawsuits
are
not
that
easy,
you
know,
the
facts
are
in
dispute.
i
am
just
wondering
is
your
principle
limited
to
the
case
in
which
the
state
will
stipulate
that
you
have
a
comprehensive
and
effective--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--your
theory
is
not
limited
to
a
well
managed
tribe.
is
it
limited
to
game
resources?
let
me
ask
you,
suppose
on
your
resort
you
wanted
to
run
a
gambling
table
and
that
is
against
state
law
and
it
was
not
against
tribal
law
but
there
was
no
general
harm.
it
was
well
regulated
and
well
policed
and
well
accounted
for.
would
you
say
the
tribe
would
have
the
right
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i
cannot
think
of
one
right
away,
but
some
activity
that
is
prohibited
by
state
law,
maybe
selling
liquor
on
sunday
or
after
12
o'clock
at
night
or
something
like
that
and
the
tribe
thought,
well,
they
would
rather
do
it
differently.
under
your
theory
of
indian
tribal
sovereignty,
would
they
be
permitted
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
trying
to
find
out
really
are
you
relying
primarily
on
a
federal
preemption
theory
or
an
indian
tribal
sovereignty
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
analytically
they
are
quite
different--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--obviously
that
is
true,
but
i
am
still
not
clear
on
what
you
legal
theory
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
all
you
have
to
help
me
with?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
one
of
the
questions
in
a
case
like
this
is
to
what
extent
can
an
indian
tribe
running
a
commercial
organization
like
this,
attracting
business
from
non-indians,
use
its
ability
to
grant
exemptions
from
state
laws,
for
example,
sell
hunting
licenses
at
cut
rate
prices.
can
it
use
that
as
a
means
of
tribal
development?
maybe
it
can,
but
isn't
that
part
of
the
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
do
you
licenses
cost?
what
are
your
licenses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
talk
about
package,
do
you
sell
the
licenses
separately?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
sell
the
licenses
separately?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
cost
of
a
separate
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
eight
hundred
dollars?
