justice

marshall
am
i
in
error
that
it
is
agreed
that
the
indian
licensing
procedure
is
a
good
one?
isn't
that
admitted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
where
does
the
state
get
this
additional
interest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
its
interest
is
that
they
do
it...
their
signatures
on
there
are
better
than
the
indian's
signature
on
the
license?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
never
applied
for
that
under
the
federal
law,
did
you,
the
right
to
jurisdiction
over
the
indian
reservation,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
new
mexico
did
not.
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
mean.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
they
get
it
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
does
new
mexico
get
it
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was
where
did
you
get
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
in
montana
v.
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
was
sent
back
on
montana
and
not
on
any
other
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
say
wouldn't
or
couldn't?
do
you
think
the
state
could
do
that?
