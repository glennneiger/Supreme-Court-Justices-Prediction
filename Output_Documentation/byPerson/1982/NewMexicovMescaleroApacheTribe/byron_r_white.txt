aren't
the
elk
free
to
leave
the
reservation?

white
or
through
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
do
nevertheless.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
they
roam
mostly
for
food?
justice

white
what
damage
to
the
tribal
interests
would
occur
if
the
state
regulation
were
able
to
be
enforced
against
non-indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
add
another
expense,
i
suppose,
to
the
hunter.
he
would
have
to
have
a
state
license,
which
is
not
cheap,
i
do
not
suppose.
justice

white
are
a
lot
of
your
people
from
out
of
state?
justice
byron

what
is
the
out
of
state
game
license
in
new
mexico
for
an
elk?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
elk?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
other
damage...
i
suppose
that
would
be
a
deterrent.
you
might
get
fewer
customers.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
want
to
control
the
number
of
elk?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
also
want
to
control
the
number
of
elk.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
had
only
one
season
a
year
it
might
be
a
little
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
the
state
do...
how
would
application
of
the
state
law
to
any
individual
white
hunter
interfere
with
your
having
more
than
one
season?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
white
hunter
that
wanted
to
hunt
in
one
of
your
seasons
that
did
not
fall
within
the
state
season
would
be
subject
to
arrest,
i
guess?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
arrest
people
with...
who
had
elk
in
excess
of
the
bag
limits,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
large
is
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
non-indians
live
on
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
to
hunt
anything
on
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can
hunt
anything
else,
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
want
to
come
on
the
reservation,
and
get
one
elk,
it
will
cost
you
$800?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
for
one
day?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
if
i
want
to
come
on
even
for
one
day
and
get
one
elk,
it
is
$800?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so,
but
you
would
still
have
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
state
law
was
entirely
preempted,
either
that
the
tribe
has
occupied
the
field,
so
to
speak...
just
preemption
would
not
mean
anything
more
than
that
the
state
law
is
preempted
to
the
extent
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
tribal
ordinance.
it
would
not
mean
that
they
could
not,
for
example,
insist
on
a
license.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
still
have
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
field
has
been
sufficiently
occupied
to
exclude
the
state
entirely?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
to
the
extent
of
not
being
able
to
control
non-indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
non-conflicting
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
just
a
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
with
the
state
license
they
can
go
on
the
reservation
any
time
the
indians
want--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
isn't
inconsistent
with
any
federal
statute
or
any
indian
regulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
not
taxing
the
tribe.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
not
taxing
the
tribe
or
indians.
they
are
taxing
non-indians.
i
mean
they
are
making
them
buy
licenses.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
consistent
with
some
of
our
cases,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
selling
hunting
packages--
justice
byron
r.
white
--instead
of
packages
of
cigarettes?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
competition
with
other
people
who
want
to
sell
hunting
packages?
there
is
a
little
difference
between
a
package
of
cigarettes
and
a
hunting
package.
you
don't
kill
off
elks
with
packages
of
cigarettes.
it
may
not
be
for
people
who
are
running
competing
tourist
establishments.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
at
the
other
extreme.
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
you
would
not
challenge
the
right
of
the
indians
themselves
to
hunt
without
a
state
license
or
to
hunt
in
off
season.
what
about
an
indian
himself
hunting
in
a
season
outside
the...
under
their
own
regulations?
