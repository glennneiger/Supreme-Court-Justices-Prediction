mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
plainly
stated
is
simply
does
the
state
of
new
mexico
have
the
authority
concurrent
with
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
by
non-indians
on
the
mescalero
apache
reservation.
the
history
suggests
that
it
does.
since
new
mexico
became
a
state
in
1912,
it
has
had
fish
and
game
laws
in
a
state-wide
wildlife
conservation
program.
it
has
applied
its
game
and
fish
laws
to
non-indians
hunting
and
fishing
within
all
areas
of
the
state
during
this
period
of
time.
for
approximately
the
last
15
years
since
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
has
allowed
public
hunting
on
its
reservation,
the
state
of
new
mexico
has
applied
its
game
and
fish
laws
to
non-indians
who
have
hunted
or
fished
on
that
reservation
as
it
has
with
respect
to
each
of
the
other
26
indian
reservations
or
enclaves
located
in
the
state
of
new
mexico.
during
this
period
of
time
the
state
has
not
only
enforced
its
wildlife
regulations,
but
the
wildlife
on
indian
lands
has
benefitted
from
the
full
range
of
conservation
programming
that
the
state
has
provided
over
time
on
a
state-wide
basis.
in
1977,
however,
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
passed
a
hunting
and
fishing
ordinance
which
specified
in
part
that
a
state
hunting
and
fishing
license
would
no
longer
be
required
of
any
person
hunting
or
fishing
on
the
mescalero
apache
reservation.
up
until
that
time
the
mescalero
tribe
had
acknowledged
in
its
hunting
and
fishing
brochures
that
state
game
and
fish
licensing
regulations
and
the
entire
state
game
and
fish
wildlife
regulation
did
apply
to
non-indians
hunting
or
fishing
on
the
mescalero
apache
reservation.
the
passage
of
the
new
ordinance
in
1977
followed
soon
after
the
opening
by
the
tribe
of
the
inn
of
the
mountain
gods
on
the
reservation.
the
inn
of
the
mountain
gods
is
a
deluxe
tourist
resort
featuring
a
hotel,
a
lake
for
fishing,
boating
and
water
sports,
a
golf
course,
tennis
facilities,
shooting
range,
a
stable,
and
various
other
tourist
and
convention-related
recrecational
facilities
and
activities.
the
inn
was
opened
by
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
as
part
of
a
tourism
program
organized
by
the
tribe
and
intended
to
attract
non-indians
onto
the
reservation
and
to
the
sierra
blanca
ski
resort,
which
is
a
tribal
commercial
enterprise
located
adjacent
to
the
reservation.
in
connection
with
the
opening
of
the
inn
of
the
mountain
gods,
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
also
expanded
its
hunting
and
fishing
business
to
include
big
game
animal
hunts
known
as
package
hunts.
package
hunts
include
hunting
fees,
lodging
at
the
inn
of
the
mountain
gods,
guide
service
and
various
other
hunter
needs.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
amount
or
the
size
of
the
commercial
enterprise
of
the
tribe
has
any
jurisdictional
significance.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
well,
your
honor,
the
logging
operations
were
conducted
by
non-indian
companies
together
with
indian
enterprises.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
yes,
your
honor,
i
presume
that
is
true.
in
that
respect
there
is
no
difference
between
the
cases.
there
is
a
difference,
though,
in
terms
of
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
that
applied
in
that
case,
in
the
white
mountain
apache
tribe
v.
bracker
case
to
which
you
refer
as
opposed
to
the
one
that
applies
in
this
case.
for
that
reason,
the
cases
are
distinguishable,
not
because
there
is
a
difference
in
the
commercial
enterprise
at
stake.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
your
honor,
i
recognize
that
the
montana
case
articulates
the
principles
you
have
described,
and
we
do
not
argue
that
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
does
not
have
the
right
to
admit
hunters
or
fisherman
if
it
desires
or
preclude
hunting
and
fishing
if
it
desires.
it
can
also
establish
terms
and
conditions
for
hunting
and
fishing
if
it
so
decides.
the
montana
case
certainly
permits
that.
but
the
montana
case
did
not
suggest
that
when
a
tribe
enjoys
this
authority
over
non-indian
visitors
on
its
reservation,
that
that
authority
is
exclusive
of
state
authority
which
normally
applies
to
non-indians.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
your
honor,
you
suggest
an
extreme
case,
which
is
not
a
part
of
the
factual
situation
here,
but
i
acknowledge
that,
built
in
to
a
system
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
is
the
possibility
of
conflicts
arising
between
the
two
sets
of
laws.
our
position
is
that
the
state
of
new
mexico
as
a
sovereign
continues
to
have
the
authority
to
apply
its
laws
to
non-indians
who
are
not
immune
from
those
laws
as
indians
are
and
that
a
reservation
does
not
provide
that
immunity
to
a
non-indian
unless
that
non-indian
can
claim
that
he,
too,
is
excused
from
obeying
state
law
because
there
is
a
federal
law
that
preempts
those
state
laws
that
he
has
to
abide
by
instead,
or
that
his
relationship
with
the
tribe
concerns
a
matter
of
the
internal
governmental
relations
of
the
tribe
and
for
that
reason
tribal
law
alone
controls.
but
under
normal
circumstances
as
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
suggests
that
the
normal
circumstance
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
those
situations
when
a
tribe
does
enjoy
jurisdiction
over
non-indians,
which
is
not
always
the
case.
the
importance
of
the
montana
case
to
this
case,
in
fact,
is
the
statement
in
that
case
that
as
a
general
proposition,
and
those
are
the
words
of
this
court,
as
a
general
proposition
the
inherent
sovereign
authority
of
an
indian
tribe
does
not
extend
to
non-indians.
that
is
the
normal
proposition.
the
court
did
articulate
and
identify
circumstances
in
which
an
indian
tribe
may
regulate
activities
of
non-members.
in
fact,
the
court
said
that
a
tribe
may
regulate
through
taxation,
licensing
and
other
means
the
activities
of
non-members
who
enter
into
consensual
relationships
with
the
tribe
through
commercial
dealings,
contracts,
leases,
and
the
like.
and
that
may
very
well
be
the
case
here.
but--
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
--your
honor,
no,
you
are
quite
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
your
honor,
we
do
have
conflicts.
we
do
not
have
the
particular
one
that
justice
o'connor
identified
or
any
one
quite
that
dramatic,
but
we
do
have
conflicts
in
the
regulations.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
if
we
had
not,
perhaps
this
case
would
not
have
arisen.
but
i
am
not
suggesting,
your
honor,
and
i
did
not
mean
to
leave
the
impression
that
there
are
no
conflicts
in
those
laws.
we
recognize
that
and
we
recognize
the
potential
for
others.
what
we
are
saying,
however,
is
that
the
state
nevertheless
enjoys
the
right
it
has
as
a
sovereign
to
apply
its
laws
to
non-members
of
an
indian
tribe
unless,
again,
those
laws
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
preempted
by
a
federal
regulatory
scheme
or
that
the
sovereign
powers
of
the
tribe
with
reference
to
the
governing
of
its
own
members
and
their
internal
affairs
would
be
disrupted
and
frustrated
in
a
given
instance.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
or
for
any
one
of
the
other
26
indian
reservations
or
enclaves
located
in
new
mexico
which
together
comprise
over
7
million
acres
of
land
and
11,000
square
miles,
approximately
10
percent
of
the
land
area
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
located
in
virtually
every
region
or
part
of
the
state.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
your
honor,
that
is
in
our
statement--
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
the
interest
of
the
state
in
licensing
per
se
is
that
the
licensing
permit
system
is
an
essential
part
of
the
overall
conservation
program
of
the
state.
through
the
licensing
mechanism,
the
state
is
able
to
control
the
harvest,
is
able
to
ascertain
also
the
success
ratio
of
particular
hunting
seasons
and
in
particular
areas,
and
for
that
reason,
the
licensing
system
in
the
judgment
of
the
department
of
game
and
fish
of
the
state
is
an
essential
ingredient
in
the
overall
conservation
program
of
the
state
as
well
as
are
the
substantive
regulations
pertaining
to
the
season
dates,
bag
limits,
and
the
like.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
your
honor,
we
recognize
that
the
tribe
has
a
licensing
permit
system
and
have
no
quarrel
with
their
right
to
impose
one.
the
record
does
indicate
that
at
the
present
time
the
ordinances
of
the
tribe
maintain
a
sufficient
wildlife
population
on
the
reservation
to
be
consistent
with
wholesome
conservation
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
well,
the
state's
interest,
your
honor,
is--
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
--no,
your
honor,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
one
licensing
system
is
better
than
another.
it
has
to
do
with
the
authority
of
the
state
to
apply
its
laws
to
non-indians
anywhere
within
its
borders--
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
--the--
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
--new
mexico
is
not
a
public
law
280
state,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
but
in
our
view--
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
well,
your
honor,
in
our
view
the
public
law
280
is
not
the
only
source
of
authority
for
a
state
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
within
its
borders.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
our
authority
over
non-indians,
your
honor,
stems
from
the
fact
that
new
mexico
is
one
of
the
50
sovereign
states
of
the
union
and
was
admitted
to
the
union
on
equal
protection
with
other
states
who
have
the
authority
within
their
borders
even
on
indian
land
to
apply
their
laws
to
non-indians
unless,
again,
those
laws
have
been
preempted
by
a
superior
congressional
enactment
and
scheme
of
regulation
or
unless
in
a
particular
situation
the
non-indian
is
acting
in
relationship
to
the
tribe
so
that
the
internal
governmental
affairs
and
social
relations
of
the
tribe
are
intimately
involved
in
that
situation.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
yes,
your
honor,
and
confederated
tribes
of
the
coville
indian
reservation
v.
washington,
and
thomas
v.
gay,
and
mescalero
v.
jones.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
case
was
here
once
before
pursuant
to
a
petition
for
certiorari
which
the
state
filed
after
the
original
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit.
on
its
first
visit
this
court
summarily
remanded
the
case
to
the
tenth
circuit.
this
court
vacated
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit,
remanded
the
case
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
montana
case.
on
remand,
however,
the
tenth
circuit
simply
reinstated
its
original
decision
and
dismissed
this
court's
decision
in
the
montana
case
as
essentially
irrelevant
to
a
decision
in
this
case.
and
the
tenth
circuit
sought
to
explain
its
decision
in
that
regard
by
suggesting
that
the
montana
case
involved
non-indian
fee
lands
within
the
crow
reservation
and
the
question
of
whether
a
tribe,
being
the
crow
tribe
in
that
case,
could
impose
or
regulate
non-indian
hunting
and
fishing
on
those
non-indian
fee
lands
whereas
this
case
involves
tribal
trust
lands
within
a
reservation
and
the
authority
of
a
state
to
regulate
non-indian
hunting
and
fishing
within
those
tribal
trust
lands.
now,
these
differences,
of
course,
do,
in
fact,
exist
between
these
two
cases,
but
that
much
was
evident
when
this
court
originally
remanded
this
case
back
to
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
first
place.
so
despite
these
factual
differences,
the
montana
case
remains
crucial
to
this
case
because
of
one
of
its
underlying
principles.
the
montana
case,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
stated,
as
had
this
court
in
oliphant
v.
suquamish
indian
tribe
and
wheeler
v.
united
states,
that
as
a
general
proposition
the
inherent
authority
of
a
tribe
does
not
extend
to
non-indians.
the
basis
of
the
montana
case
was
not
that
non-indian
fee
lands
were
involved
but
that
non-indians
were
involved.
the
court
did
not
say
that
tribal
laws
do
not
apply
on
non-indian
fee
lands.
it
said
that
tribal
laws
do
not
apply
to
non-indians
as
a
general
rule
regardless
of
whether--
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
--your
honor,
we
recognize
that
1165
provides
a
criminal
trespass
penalty,
a
federal
criminal
trespass
penalty
to
be
imposed
upon
a
person
who
enters
a
reservation
without
the
permission
of
the
tribe
for
purposes
of
hunting
or
fishing.
it
does
not
regulate
the
conduct
of
a
person
on
the
reservation
in
terms
of
his
hunting
and
fishing
activity.
it
does
not
recognize,
your
honor,
as
you
suggest
that
the
tribe
has
the
authority
to
impose
regulations
that
would
oust
state
law
if
that
was
the
justice's
suggest.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
penalty
imposed
by
that
statute
does
not
require
that
a
state
law
be
violated
before
it
is
implemented.
but
again
it
is
only
a
criminal
trespass
statute
as
the
legislative
history
clearly
suggests.
it
does
not
punish
anything
other
than
entry
without
permission,
and
for
that
reason
it
does
not
provide
the
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme
with
regard
to
hunting
and
fishing
that
was
apparent
or
present
in
the
bracker
case
with
reference
to
the
logging
and
timber
operations
involved
in
that
case.
the
problem
with
the
original
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
this
particular
case
was
that
it
failed
to
recognize,
either
in
its
original
decision
or
on
remand,
the
general
proposition
which
this
court
stated
in
montana
that
non-indians
are
normally
not
subject
to
tribal
law.
in
fact,
it
inverted
that
principle
and
started
at
the
threshold
with
the
observation
that
in
the
area
of
game
and
fish
regulation
the
inherent
sovereign
powers
of
a
tribe
extend
to
non-members
and
they
are
exclusive,
in
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit.
in
that
regard,
the
tenth
circuit
has
fashioned
essentially
a
new
rule
of
law
which
has
no
judicial
authority
to
support
it
whatsoever.
it
is
certainly
squarely
in
conflict
with
this
court's
judgment
in
the
montana
case
as
well
as
many
other
cases
in
this
court,
one,
for
example,
being
washington
v.
fishing
vessels
association
which
clearly
held
that
an
indian
tribe
does
not
have
complete
dominion
over
the
taking
of
any
species
even
though
it
may
have
a
treaty
right
to
hunt
and
fish
free
of
state
regulation.
so
we
have
here
a
situation
in
which
the
tenth
circuit
has
adopted
a
position
in
this
case
which
is
virtually
synonymous
with
the
position
advocated
by
the
solicitor
general
in
bracker
and
in
the
ramah
navajo
case
but
rejected
by
this
court
to
the
effect
that
on-reservation
activities
affecting
a
resident
tribe
should
be
considered
presumptively
beyond
the
reach
of
state
law
by
operation
of
the
principle
of
tribal
sovereignty.
so
that
in
that
situation
a
state
would
have
to
establish
its
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
by
pointing
to
a
specific
congressional
delegation
of
authority
to
exercise
its
power,
or
it
would
have
to
show
an
essential
need
to
regulate
in
support
of
a
vital
state
interest.
but
this
court
said
no
to
that
proposition
in
bracker
and
in
ramah
and
it
should
say
no
to
the
tenth
circuit's
formulation
of
the
same
principle
in
this
case.
as
we
discussed
earlier,
the
montana
case
did
recognize
that
there
are
situations
in
which
tribal
ordinances
may
be
applied
to
indians,
but
in
those
situations
as
a
general
proposition
state
law
remains
concurrent
with
tribal
law
unless
again
there
has
been
a
federal
regulatory
scheme
based
upon
congressional
legislation
and
implementing
regulations
which
preempt
state
law
and
that
requires
an
examination
of
the
particular
context
to
determine
if
there
is
such
legislation,
if
there
are
such
regulations
and
then
a
particularized
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
the
state,
federal,
and
tribal
interests
is
initiated
to
determine
whether
or
not
in
the
specific
context
of
a
particular
case
the
exercise
of
state
authority
would
violate
that
particular
regulatory
scheme.
in
this
case,
the
tenth
circuit
did
embark
upon
that
inquiry
eventually,
choosing
not
to
rest
its
decision
entirely
on
its
novel
formulation
respecting
the
exclusive
tribal
sovereignty
over
non-indians
where
wildlife
is
concerned.
but
the
inquiries
it
made
were
so
distorted
by
the
threshold
view
that
it
had
adopted
that
its
inquiries
really
cannot
withstand
critical
examination
in
light
of
the
authorities
articulated
by
this
court.
for
example,
in
conducting
its
inquiry
with
regard
to
preemption,
the
tenth
circuit
noted
that
when
a
state
asserts
authority
over
the
conduct
of
non-indians
what
is
called
for
is
a
particularized
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
the
various
state,
federal,
and
tribal
interests
at
stake.
what
the
court
below
failed
to
recognize,
however,
is
that
before
one
engages
in
a
particularized
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
the
interests
at
stake,
there
must
be
a
point
of
departure,
a
frame
of
reference,
a
context
in
which
to
conduct
that
inquiry.
and
that
context
is
the
existence
of
a
congressional
enactment
or
set
of
laws
and
a
set
of
implementing
regulations
which
establish
a
comprehensive
and
pervasive
scheme
of
federal
regulation
over
the
activity
in
question.
as
this
court
said
in
the
ramah
case,
it
is
federal
law
reflecting
the
various
federal
and
tribal
interests
which
must
be
found
in
order
for
state
law
to
be
preempted.
one
does
not
simply
view
the
interests
at
stake,
add
them
up,
or
weigh
them
in
the
abstract.
on
the
contrary,
unless
there
is
federal
legislation
and
implementing
regulations,
there
is
no
question
at
all
of
preemption.
for
example,
in
the
white
mountain
case
this
court
considered
whether
or
not
the
state
of
arizona
may
impose
certain
taxes
on
non-indian
logging
and
timber
companies,
as
we
have
previously
described.
in
finding
these
laws
preemptive,
this
court
said
that
in
that
situation
the
federal
government's
regulation
of
the
harvesting
of
indian
timber
is
comprehensive.
in
the
words
of
the
court,
that
regulation
takes
the
form
of
acts
of
congress,
detailed
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
interior,
and
day-to-day
supervision
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
in
the
ramah
case
similarly,
for
example,
this
court
declared
new
mexico's
gross
receipts
tax
as
applied
to
a
non-indian
construction
company
building
a
school
for
indian
school
children
on
the
reservation
to
be
preempted.
but
in
that
case
the
court
pointed
to
the
indian
self-determination
in
education
assistance
act,
the
indian
financing
act
of
1974
and
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
thereunder,
which
among
other
things
gave
the
bia
wide-ranging
authority
to
monitor
the
entire
construction
program.
in
that
context,
this
court
found
that
the
imposition
of
additional
state
burdens
on
that
federal
regulatory
scheme
would
not
be
permissible,
the
state
interest
being
simply
raising
revenue.
but
again
the
preemption
analysis
begins
with
an
examination
of
the
context
in
which
it
arises
to
determine
if
there
are
congressional
enactments,
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
regulations
of
the
executive
branch
which
establish
a
federal
regulatory
scheme
with
respect
to
which
the
state
is
not
permitted
to
intrude.
short
of
that,
there
is
no
question
of
preemption,
and
state
laws
prevail
with
respect
to
non-indians
on
indian
land.
with
reference
to
the
question
of
infringement
in
this
case,
it
is
based
really
upon
two
points.
one
being
the
possible
financial
impairment
to
the
tribe's
revenues
as
a
result
of
the
application
of
state
laws
and
the
claim
that
implementation
of
state
regulation
over
non-indians
would
create
conflicts
in
the
dual
regulatory
schemes.
as
we
have
indicated,
that
conflict
alone
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
the
coville
cigarette
tax
cases
is
not
a
basis
for
a
determination
of
infringement.
with
reference
to
the
claim
of
financial
impairment,
factually
that
has
not
happened
in
the
case.
in
fact,
revenue
levels
have
increased
both
with
respect
to
the
hunting
and
fishing
business
of
the
tribe
and
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
the
hunting
and
fishing
program
itself.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
reference
to
justice
powell's
inquiry,
i
should
point
out
that
there
is
no
federal
involvement
whatsoever
in
the
enforcement
of
tribal
regulations
in
the
area
of
hunting
and
fishing.
moreover,
tribal
regulations,
tribal
ordinances
themselves
even
if
they
are
comprehensive
cannot
by
their
own
terms
oust,
or
by
their
own
force
oust
state
law
applicable
to
non-indians,
and
this
court
has
so
held
in
washington
v.
the
confederated
tribes
of
the
coville
indian
reservation
where
the
court
said,
we
are
not
going
to
adopt
the
far-reaching
notion
that
an
indian
tribe
has
the
authority
as
the
united
states
would
have
to
preempt
state
law
merely
by
enacting
a
legislative
ordinance
that
pertains
to
the
same
conduct
that
state
law
purports
to
regulate.
if
this
were
true,
if
a
tribe
were
able
to
do
this,
then
any
indian
ordinance
passed
would...
if
a
tribe
were
able
to
do
this
simply
because
the
federal
government
does
approve
its
ordinances,
if
that
alone
were
enough
to
give
it
preemptive
effect,
then
any
indian
ordinance
of
any
kind
adopted
by
an
indian
tribe
applicable
to
non-indians
at
least
would
be
preemptive
of
any
state
law
that
applied
to
the
same
situation
because
as
the
solicitor
general
noted,
all
indian
ordinances
that
apply
to
non-indians
have
to
be
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
if
his
imprimatur
of
that
regulation
is
enough
to
give
the
indian
ordinance
preemptive
effect,
then
we
have
an
open-ended
situation
that
whenever
an
indian
tribe
enacts
any
ordinance
whatsoever
state
law
is
preempted.
but
again,
that--
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
--no,
the
cases
of
this
court
would
not
permit
that
at
all.
in
fact,
the
court
has
held
the
opposite.
the
question
is
essentially
foreclosed.
as
this
court
said,
again
in
the
coville
cigarette
tax
cases,
we
are
not
going
to
the
extreme
of
adopting
a
rule
of
law
that
would
allow
indian
ordinances
to
oust
state
law
as
the
federal
government
may
do
if
it
enacts
this--
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
--well,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
tribe
by
its
actions
can
preempt
state
law,
there
wouldn't
be
any
difference
at
all
because--
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
--we
are
selling--
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
--that
is
correct.
the
tribe
is
selling
the
privilege
of
hunting--
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
--there
is
absolutely
no
state
restriction
applicable
to
that
situation
at
all.
that
would
be
wholly
permissible,
and
we
would
not
exercise
jurisdiction
to
prevent
an
indian
within
his
resident
reservation
from
hunting
according
to
the
regulations
established
by
the
tribe
itself.
mr.
thomas
l.
dunigan
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
the
state
could
do
that.
in
fact,
there
is
a
state
law...
even
under
state
law
it
could
not
because
there
is
a
state
law
that
prevents
it,
whatever
else
may
prevent
it
as
well.
thank
you.
