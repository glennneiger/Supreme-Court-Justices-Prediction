we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
new
mexico,
et
al
against
the
mescalero
apache
tribe.
mr.
dunnigan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
it
make
any
difference,
mr.
dunnigan,
how
much
of
the
activity
the
mescaleros
were
engaged
in,
whether
it
was
one
resort
or
a
great
many,
a
small
amount
or
a
great
deal
of
this
hunting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
distinguish
it
from
the
logging
operations,
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
indians
could
have
done
it
all
on
their
own
if
they
wanted,
had
they
had
the
equipment
and
the
personnel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
fettinger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
make
any
difference
if
it
were
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
this
reservation
created
before
new
mexico
was
a
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
same
difficulty
that
others
on
the
bench
have
had
in
discerning
your
theory.
i
finally
concluded
between
the
lines,
at
least,
you
were
saying
that
this
reservation,
460,000
acres,
is
just
as
independent
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
just
as
independent
of
new
mexico
as
arizona
is
independent
of
new
mexico.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
subject
to
the
interior
department
control.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
claiborne,
would
you
mind
addressing
my
last
question
and
those
of
the
others
on
the
theory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
were
being
mismanaged
badly
for
any
reason,
lack
of
direction
at
the
top,
what
would
be
the
control
of
the
department
of
interior?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
dunigan?
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
ask
you
a
question--
--do
you
not
think
there
is
a
little
difference
between
the
preemption,
if
that
was
what
you
were
suggesting,
of
sales
of
cigarettes
on
a
reservation,
sales
to
non-indians
and
the
control
and
regulation
of
the
wildlife
and
game?
don't
you
think
there
is
quite
a
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
