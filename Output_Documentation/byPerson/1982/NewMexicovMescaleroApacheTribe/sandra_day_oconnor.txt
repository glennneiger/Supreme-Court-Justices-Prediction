mr.

justice

the
court
in
montana
v.
united
states,
of
course,
recognized
that
an
indian
tribe
can
prohibit
non-members
from
hunting
and
fishing
on
the
reservation
or
can
allow
them
and
condition
that
permit
as
the
tribe
determines.
now
how
do
you
reconcile
what
new
mexico
is
asking
for
here
with
that
case
because
it
would
seem
that
if
the
tribe
has
a
right
to
condition
the
hunting
and
fishing
as
described
in
montana,
that
the
right
would
be
meaningless
if
a
state
were
allowed
to
apply
inconsistent
regulations.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
they
could
be
totally
inconsistent.
for
instance,
i
do
not
know
what
the
circumstances
are
here,
but
a
tribe
might
develop
the
game
to
such
an
extent
that
it
can
offer
people
a
chance
to
take
five
elk
whereas
the
new
mexico
requirements
might
permit
someone
to
take
only
one,
and
the
two
would
be
quite
inconsistent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
have
a
statute
here,
18
u.s.c.
1165
in
which
congress
has
indicated
that
there
is
a
right
of
the
tribe
to
regulate
the
hunting
and
fishing
on
the
reservation
as
to
non-members.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
the
statute
unlike,
for
example,
the
liquor
statute,
it
does
not
indicate
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
has
to
be
done
in
conformity
with
the
laws
of
the
state.
that
language
is
absent
from
this
hunting
and
fishing
statute.
isn't
that
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fettinger,
your
time
is
running
out,
and
like
justice
stevens,
i
am
a
little
concerned
about
your
legal
theory
more
than
i
am
about
the
facts.
what
in
the
preemption
area
are
you
looking
at
specifically
to
constitute
the
preemption
because
it
is
not
as
comprehensive
a
regulatory
scheme
at
the
federal
level
as
is
the
case
with
timber,
for
example?
