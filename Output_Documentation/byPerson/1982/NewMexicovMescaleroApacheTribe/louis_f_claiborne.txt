mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
certainly.
we
approach
the
case
on
three
different
bases.
the
first
as
we
read
the
injunction
of
this
court
in
the
white
mountain
apache
case,
the
test
this
court
has
laid
down
in
judging
whether
the
activity
of
non-indians
within
an
indian
reservation
is
or
is
not
exempted
from
state
law
depends
on
a
weighing
of
the
respective
interests
of
the
federal
government,
the
state
government,
and
the
indian
government.
we
have
engaged
in
our
brief
in
that
weighing
here
and
find
that
what
is
conspicuously
lacking
is
any
serious
claim
of
state
interest.
there
is
no
allegation
that
there
is
a
need
for
state
intervention
to
preserve
the
species
or
any
other
conservation
purpose.
there
is
a
concession
that
the
tribal
activity
and
the
way
in
which
the
program
is
managed
is
sound
and
creates
no
off-reservation
harm.
the
only
interest
which
the
state
asserts
is
one
to
manage
the
wildlife
of
the
entire
state
in
a
unit,
but
that
interest
is
one
which
cannot
prevail
for
if
the
tribe,
as
it
is
plainly
free
to
do,
were
to
close
the
reservation
to
non-indians
and
manage
the
resources
for
its
own
benefit,
clearly
state
regulation
would
not
be
applicable
there.
we
cannot
appreciate
why
that
management
of
the
same
fish
and
game
on
the
same
lands
should
be
a
greater
interest
to
the
state
merely
because
the
hunting
and
fishing
is
done
by
non-indians
rather
than
by
indians.
now,
so
much
for
our
initial
approach
to
the
case.
we
do
assert
what
this
court
has
labeled
the
two
independent
barriers
to
state
jurisdiction
within
an
indian
reservation,
they
being
an
infringement
on
the
right
of
tribal
self-government
or
tribal
sovereignty.
here
we
see,
particularly
with
respect
to
game
management,
a
native
resource,
a
special
tribal
claim
to
assert
its
jurisdiction
within
what
are
tribal
lands
in
its
territory,
the
reservation.
that
interest
here
is
conspicuous
because
the
tribe
itself
as
a
government
has
determined
to
exploit
its
resource,
to
manage
it
for
conservation
purposes,
but
also
for
the
generation
of
revenues.
it
has
developed
a
comprehensive,
and
the
state
concedes,
a
wholly
satisfactory
scheme,
one
which
involves
the
tribal
government,
employs
tribal
members,
and
generates
important
income
for
governmental
tribal
purposes.
hence,
the
claim
of
any
infringement
with
that
scheme
is
a
serious
one
in
this
case.
we
also
look
to
the
preemption
analysis
which
this
court
has
traditionally
found
to
be
an
independent
barrier
to
state
regulation
and
taxation
within
a
reservation.
here,
to
be
sure,
we
do
not
have
the
pervasive
federal
scheme
that
was
present
in
white
mountain,
but
we
do
have
a
very
clear
congressional
indication,
both
in
1165
in
the
exemptions
of
public
law
280
in
the
treaty
with
the
mescalero
and
elsewhere
of
an
indication
by
congress
that
the
management
of
wildlife
within
a
reservation
is
a
matter
to
be
left
to
the
tribal
authority
for
the
most
part.
and
here
we
have
no
vacuum.
we
have
the
tribe
taking
up
the
invitation
which
congress
has
given
and
developing
in
a,
as
i
say,
satisfactory
way
a
very
comprehensive
and
very
pervasive
wildlife
management
scheme
which
is
partly
conservationist
and
partly
a
business
venture.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
important
that
the
department
of
interior
yearly,
annually,
approves
each
of
the
ordinances
enacted
by
the
tribe
and
in
that
way
assures
itself
that
the
management
scheme
of
the
tribe
is
indeed
a
sound
one.
what
is
more,
the
bia
and
other
federal
agencies
have
very
importantly
collaborated
in
the
beginning
of
this
venture
and
continue
to
provide
on
a
daily
basis
assistance,
expertise,
and
help
in
overseeing
and
approving
annually
the
ordinances
of
the
tribe
and
its
program.
so
there
is
that
assurance
in
the
supervision
of
the
department
of
interior
that
the
tribe,
as
new
mexico
concedes,
are
managing
this
venture
and
this
game
in
a
proper
way.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
powell,
i
should
know
the
answer,
but
i
don't.
i
should
point--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--justice
powell,
i
think
it
is
right
to
say
that
the
united
states
or
the
department
of
interior
customarily
approves
any
tribal
ordinance
which
has
an
effect
on
non-indians
within
that
reservation,
whether
it
is
hunting
or
fishing
or
any
other
activity.
most
tribal
constitutions
provide
that
any
ordinance
that
impacts
on
non-indians
within
the
reservation
must
be
submitted
for
approval
to
the
secretary.
so
that
that
is
the
normal
scheme.
now,
a
tribe
which
closed
its
borders
to
outsiders,
its
own
ordinance
if
it
had
one
with
respect
to
hunting
and
fishing
by
tribal
members,
might
not
similarly
be
subject
to--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
don't
know
that
that
is
so,
justice
powell,
but
i
must
say
that
here
there
is
no
suggestion--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
and
that
is
the
aspect
in
which
this
case,
though
different
from
white
mountain
apache,
involves
an
equally
pervasive
if
not
more
pervasive
scheme
of
regulation
which
has
the
imprimatur
of
federal
approval
and
continuing
federal
monitoring.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
rehnquist,
in
white
mountain
apache
so
far
as
i
am
aware
there
was
no
tribal
comprehensive
scheme.
in
that
instance
the
regulatory
scheme
was
federal,
not
tribal,
but
in
other
cases
as
in
fisher
and,
indeed,
as
in
mazurie
the
court
indicated
that
when
a
tribal
law
or
ordinance
is
enacted
pursuant
to
federal
authority
and
with
federal
approval,
it
may
have
the
preemptive
effect
which
the
federal
regulation
itself
was
held
to
have.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
invoke
the
court's
holdings
in
white
mountain
apache
and
in
ramah
navajo
to
the
effect
that
the
preemption
test
with
respect
to
preemption
of
state
law
on
indian
reservations
is
a
very
different
one.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
preempting
only
what
is
inconsistent.
it
is
a
rule
that
state
law
will
be
seen
to
be
preempted
if
the
federal
authority
has
either
itself
or
delegated
to
the
tribe
sufficient
authority.
here
the
tribe
has
fully
occupied
the
field,
however--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--indeed.
that
itself--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
would
submit
that
there
is
here
plainly
no
room
left
for
duplicative
and
conflicting
regulation
by
the
state
of
new
mexico.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
wholly
consistent,
it
may
be--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
the
licences--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--the
state
license
is
imposing
an
additional,
an
important
burden
in
the
same
way
that
the
tax
in
white
mountain
apache--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--nor
is
any
tax,
as
the
tax
in
white
mountain,
ever
inconsistent.
it
is
simply
an
additional
burden
which
so
disarranges
the
scheme
that
it--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
am
sorry,
sir?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
nor
was
the
tax
in
white
mountain
imposed
on
indians
but
on
the
non-indian
corporation
and
so
in
ramah
it
was
imposed
on
the
construction
company
and
nevertheless
was
held
to
be
preempted
by
federal
regulation.
