justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
claiborne,
are
there
any
other
indian
tribes
in
new
mexico
that
are
regulated
in
a
comparable
way
to
this
particular
tribe?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
i
am
leading
up
to
inquire
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
government
customarily
approves
the
ordinances
of
tribes
around
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
taking
of
game
and
fish?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
supervision
of
the
federal
government
go
to
the
extent
of
ascertaining
whether
or
not
their
game
and
fish
laws
are
enforced
by
the
tribe?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
i
have
the
same
interest
that
other
justices
have
expressed.
your
brief
states
that
the
ordinances,
having
been
approved
by
the
secretary,
have
the
force
of
federal
law.
if
that
is
so,
isn't
that
a
complete
answer
if
you
are
correct
with
respect
to
that?
that
is
preemption
100
percent,
isn't
it?
