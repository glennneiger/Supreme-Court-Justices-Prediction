mr.
dunnigan,
perhaps
i
am
mistaken,
but
i
thought
the
record
does
disclose
conflicts
between
the
state
system
and
the
tribal
system
particularly
as
to
the
taking
of
deer,
that
does
may
not
be
taken
under
the
state
regulations,
but
under
the
tribal
ones
a
buck
and
a
doe
could
be
taken.
am
i
mistaken?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
we
do
have
some
very
definite
conflicts
as
justice
o'connor
indicated?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
want
the
state
regulation
uniformly
applied
to
non-indians
all
across
the
state.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
that
there
should
not
be
an
exception
of
a
cuna
so
to
speak
for
the
mescalero
reservation?
