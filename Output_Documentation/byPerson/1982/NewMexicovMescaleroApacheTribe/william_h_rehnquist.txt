mr.
fettinger,
is
the
hunter
going
to
run
into
any
problems
knowing
when
he
leaves
the
land
that
is
governed
by
state
licensing
and
going
onto
the
indian
reservation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
that?
about
1,000
square
miles?
800
square
miles?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
six
forty
into
460,
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
that
case,
mr.
claiborne,
it
would
have
been
unnecessary
for
the
court
to
refer
at
all
in
white
mountain
apache
to
the
federal
statutory
structure
if
a
tribal
ordinance
which
is
approved
by
the
department
of
the
interior
has
the
force
of
federal
preemptive
law.
i
mean
a
lot
of
our
discussion
of
these
cases
has
been
quite
unnecessary
if
that
is
the
principle.
