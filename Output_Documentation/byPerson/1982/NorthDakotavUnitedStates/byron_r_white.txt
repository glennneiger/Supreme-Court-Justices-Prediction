justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
governor
ever
signing
these
authorizations
if
it
was
a
parcel
by
parcel
thing?
he
authorized
the
acquisition
of
certain
acreages
in
each
county,
certain
acreages--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
your
claim
is
that...
well,
do
you
mean
not
specific
parcels...
up
to
any
amount
he
agreed
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
you
are
saying
it
has
to
be
a
parcel
to
parcel
thing.
well,
there
was
no
possible
reason
for
ever
getting
the
authorization
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
should
have
just
said,
wait
a
minute,
george,
when
you
get
ready
to
acquire
a
parcel,
just
come
back
and
ask
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
didn't.
he
says,
go
ahead
and
acquire
50,000
acres.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
neither
did
they
ask
him
to
give
them
anything.
they
just
wanted--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't
the
past
acquisitions
where
individual
parcels
hadn't
been
submitted
to
the
governor,
why
wouldn't
they
be
vulnerable?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
has
been
revoked,
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
that
until
the
consent
is
revoked,
or
something
equivalent
to
it,
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
can
go
ahead--
justice
byron
r.
white
--even
though
it
isn't
parcel
by
parcel
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
south
dakota
area.
north
dakota
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
isn't
that
a
yes
or
no
answer
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
state
statute,
which--
justice
byron
r.
white
--a
legislative...
a
legislative
revocation.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
governor...
if
the
state
law
purported
to
revoke
a
governor's
consent,
and
the
governor
turned
right
around
and
gave
it
again,
i
suppose
as
far
as
the
federal
law
is
concerned
the
condition
would
be
satisfied.
there
would
be
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
statutes
should
be
interpreted
as
simply
putting
conditions
on
the
pre-existing
governor's
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
governor
guy's
consent
has
never
been
revoked.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
if
the
united
states
must
have
a
governor's
consent...
suppose
the
united
states
went
ahead
and
satisfied
the
statutory
conditions,
the
state
statutory
conditions.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
still
have
to
satisfy
the
federal
statutory
conditions.
justice
byron
r.
white
namely
in
having
a
governor's
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
governor
guy's
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
governor's
consent
has
never
been
revoked.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
question
is
whether
the
legislature
may
put
conditions
on
a
governor's
consent
that
the
federal
act
requires
that
the
federal
act
does
not
authorize.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
is
still
a
question
of
whether
there
is
a
governor's
consent
under
the
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
federal
law
doesn't
require
any
legislative
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
do
not
claim
now
that
governor
guy's
consent
has
ever
been
revoked.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
by
anybody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
united
states
satisfied
the
legislative
conditions
imposed
by
the
state
legislature,
it
could
go
ahead
based
on
guy's
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
has
never
revoked
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
authorized
to
say
that
he
has
revoked
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
even
claim
that
he
has
revoked
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
the
attorney
general
doesn't
claim
governor
guy's
consent
has
ever
been
revoked.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
by
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
attorney
general
now
says
the
governor's
consent
has
never
been
revoked.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
were
going
to
satisfy
the
legislative
conditions
imposed
by
the
state
legislature,
you
would
have
to
still
have
a
governor's
consent,
and
whose
would
it
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
stipulation
just
recites
what
the
state's
position
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
recites
your
contrary
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
it
doesn't...
but
it
doesn't
explain
how
the
state
claims
cancellation
has
been
effected.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
they
ever
taken
a
position
in
this
litigation
how
it
has
been
effected?
the
attorney
general
now
says
it
has
never
been
effected.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
practice
has
always
been
to
do
it
in
the
manner
you
did
it
here,
namely,
county
by
county,
rather
than
parcel
by
parcel?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
have
done
it
both
ways?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
didn't
he
just...
why
was
the...
why
was
the
position
of
north
dakota
such
a
hindrance
to
the
federal
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
didn't
you
just
get
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
they
didn't.
they
just
had
conditions.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
you...
did
north
dakota
take
the
position
that
there's
no
way
that
we'll
ever
give
consent
to
acquisition
of
any
more
wetlands?
i
thought
there
were
just
conditions
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
has
revoked.
it
may
be,
they
may
have
revoked.
but
they've
never...
has
the
united
states
ever
tried
to
satisfy
those
conditions
and
get
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
with
the
consent...
even
satisfying
the
conditions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
he
ever
proposed...
have
you
ever
gone
to
the
governor,
olson
or
to
link,
and
said,
here's
a
tract,
a
specific
tract
of
land
we
want
to
acquire,
give
us
your
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
governor?
by
whom,
by
the
governor?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
the
governor's
consent
that
you
needed.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
turned
down,
the
specific
tracts
turned
down,
by
the
governor?
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
etkind,
suppose
you
submitted
a
particular
tract
to
the
governor
now
and
he
consented,
but
that
the
legislative
conditions
were
not
complied
with.
do
you
think
you
could
go
ahead?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
united
states'
position
with
respect
to
the
relationship
between
the
legislation
and
the
power
of
the
governor
to
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
the
governor's
consent,
future
consents,
must
be
consistent
with
and
comply
with
the
state
legislation,
the
'77
legislation?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
but
even
if...
suppose
we
disagreed
with
you,
that
the
governor,
that
the
state
may
revoke,
and
so
you
have
to
go
get
the
governor's
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
you
go
get
the
governor's
consent,
do
you
have
to
get
a
consent
on
conditions
that
are
consistent
with
the
state
legislature?
or
just,
can
you
ignore
the
state
legislation
and
just
get
the
governor's
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
governor
revoke
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
said,
i
will
never...
i
will
not
agree
to
any
further
acquisitions,
if
some
piece
of
land
the
united
states
claimed
was
covered
by
a
prior
consent
and
governor
link
says,
i
will
not
agree
to
that,
has
he
in
effect
revoked
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
still
say,
then,
that
the
prior
consents
have
never
been
revoked
by
a
governor?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
no
conduct
by
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
they
revoked?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
eighth
circuit
said
they
were
revoked,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
should
judge
the
case
on
the
ground
that
north
dakota's
legal
position
is
that
the
consents
have
purported
to
have
been
revoked.
