justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--prospective
in
what
sense?
as
i...
maybe
i
am
confused,
but
it
seemed
to
me
there
were
700,000
acres
in
which
easements
had
been
formally
acquired.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
approximately
the
same
amount
in
which
they
were
described
as
unused
or
unconsummated.
would
your
prospective
argument
not
apply
to
the
latter
group?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
governor
guy
was
an
able
person.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
ask
an
impertinent
question?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
there
any
political
overtones
in
this
litigation?
i
don't...
i
am
not
close
enough
to
north
dakota
politics.
are
the
three
governors
whose
names
have
been
mentioned,
guy,
link,
and
olsen,
are
they
all
of
the
same
party?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
which
is
who?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but

interested
in
keeping
the
ducks
breeding
and
flying.

is
kind
of
a
major
industry
is
the
dakotas.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun

is
impossible

during
the
duck
season,
isn't
it?

justice
o'connor.
do
you
want
to
answer
her
question?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
attorney
general.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
the
present
governor
olson
the
former
attorney
general
of
your
state?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
which
comes
to
us
by
way
of
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
presents
rather
a
refreshing
subject
matter
because
it
concerns
the
wild
fowl
that
fly
our
midwest
flyways,
that
is
ducks
and
geese.
the
federal
migratory
bird
hunting
stamp
act
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
acquire
easements
over
wetland
areas
suitable
for
migratory
waterfowl
breeding
and
nesting
grounds.
the
wetlands
act
of
1961
provides
that
no
land
suitable
for
waterfowl
habitats
can
be
acquired
with
money
from
the
fund
established
for
such
acquisitions
unless
the
acquisition
has
been
approved
by
the
governor
or
an
appropriate
state
agency
of
the
state
where
the
land
is
located.
between
1961
and
1977,
successive
governors
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
consented
to
the
acquisition
of
easements
covering
approximately
a
million
and
half
acres
of
wetlands
in
that
state.
by
1977,
the
united
states
had
obtained
easements
covering
about
half
of
this
acreage.
in
the
1970s,
however,
cooperation
between
north
dakota
and
the
united
states
began
to
break
down,
and
in
1977,
the
state
enacted
statutes
restricting
the
ability
of
the
united
states
to
acquire
easements
over
wetlands.
and
these
statutes
sent
out
to
certain
conditions
that
must
be
met
prior
to
final
approval
of
the
acquisition
of
easements.
they
also
permitted
a
landowner
to
drain
any
after-expanded
wetland
in
excess
of
a
legal
description.
and
finally,
the
statutes
limited
all
easements
to
a
maximum
term
of
99
years.
the
united
states
brought
suits,
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
1977
north
dakota
statutes
were
hostile
to
federal
law
and
could
not
be
applied,
and
that
any
easement
acquired
in
violation
of
those
statutes
would
nonetheless
be
valid.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
united
states
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
and
north
dakota
took
an
appeal
here.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
consent
required
by
the
wetlands
act
cannot
be
revoked
at
the
will
of
an
incumbent
governor.
to
hold
otherwise
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
loan
act's
purpose
of
facilitating
the
acquisition
of
wetlands.
the
state
furthermore
may
not
revoke
its
consent
based
on
noncompliance
with
the
conditions
set
forth
in
the
1977
legislation.
to
the
extent
that
that
legislation
authorizes
a
landowner
to
drain
after
expanded
wetlands
contrary
to
the
terms
of
an
easement
agreement,
it
is
hostile
to
federal
interests
and
may
not
be
applied.
and
finally,
the
statute
limiting
the
easements
to
a
maximum
term
of
99
years
may
not
be
applied
to
wetlands
acquired
by
the
united
states
pursuant
to
previously
given
consents.
and
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
affirmed
to
the
extent
we
have
indicated.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part,
and
has
joined
therein
by
justice
rehnquist.
