justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--about
the
specificity
of
the
consent?
have
you
abandoned
the
argument
that
i
thought
you
were
making
in
your
brief
that
they
had
to
be
parcel
by
parcel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
suggest...
but
are
you
suggesting
the
statute
requires
parcel
by
parcel
consent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
one
other--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
is
the
relevance
of
your
parcel
by
parcel
consent
argument
in
your
brief
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
mean,
we
can
just
forget
about
that
part
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
the
government
concedes
that
these
consents
are
revocable.
i
didn't
read
the
government's
brief
that
way.
they
say
in
words,
"the
consent,
once
given,
cannot
be
revoked.

justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
this
map?
is
it
part
of
the
record,
or
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--your
opponents
have
seen
it,
though?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
try
to
hold
him
in
contempt,
wouldn't
you,
for
violating
an
outstanding
injunction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
you
try
to
hold
him
in
contempt
if
he
did
it
now?
isn't
there
an
injunction
outstanding,
a
declaratory
judgment
order
at
least,
that
he
can't
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
at
least
there's
a
judgment
that
says
that
he
has
already
consented.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
has
no
right
to
revoke.
isn't
that
in
the
district
court
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
think
he'd
think
twice
before
he
did
it
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you're
not
saying
that
as
to
land
where
you
claim
you
already
have
a
consent.
some
large
blocks
of
land,
you
claim
you've
got
consent,
but
you're
objecting
to
the
fact
you
have
to
comply
with
the
conditions
of
an
impact
statement
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
say
the
legislative
conditions
that
require
you
to
reimburse
them
for
an
environmental
impact
statement
and
all
that
sort
of
thing,
that's
invalid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
99-year
restriction
on
the
easement;
is
that
equally
invalid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
geared
to
this
particular
program,
the
way
these
other
things
are?
you
mean,
was
it--
--isn't
it
a
general
state
law
that
99
years
is
the
maximum
length
of
any
property
easement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
there
a
justification
for
that
rule
that
may
not
apply
to
some
of
these
other
conditions
that
place
specific
burdens
on
this
program?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
they
would
argue,
i
suppose,
that
what
you've
got
a
consent
to
is
to
acquire
in
accordance
with
the
otherwise
valid
laws
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
that
do
not
specifically
burden
wildlife
land
any
differently
than
it
burdens
anything
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
they
passed
a
new
recording
statute
that
said
every
transfer
of
real
property
has
to
be
recorded
with
the
secretary
of
state
instead
of
the
country
recorder
of
deed
or
something
like
that.
would
you
have
to
comply
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
counter
by
saying,
well,
that
may
be
better,
but
you
have
for
a
long
time
acquired
a
lot
of
easements
for
lesser
periods,
such
as
20
years
and
30
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
in
the
record
on
that
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it's
in
your
brief
i'll
find
it.
thank
you.
