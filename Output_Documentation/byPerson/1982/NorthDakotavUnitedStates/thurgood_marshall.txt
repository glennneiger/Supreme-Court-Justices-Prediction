well,
wouldn't
it
have
been
good
to
have
gotten
a
copy
of
the
thing
that
the
governor
signed?
justice

has
your

signed
any
other

without
keeping
a
copy
of
it?

justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
question
of
revocable
and
irrevocable,
that's
what
we
have
to
decide.
you
found
it
necessary
to
get
the
governor's
consent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
couldn't
operate
without
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
your
duty
to
get
it
irrevocable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
see
the
word
"irrevocable"
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
mean,
the
word
"irrevocable"
is
not
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
your
duty?
you're
the
one
who
was
doing
the
negotiating
and
you're
using
your
paper
to
write
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
don't
think
the
state
unreasonable
in
saying
the
failure
of
you
to
do
it
leaves
you
outside?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
said
it
was
a
reasonable
time,
and
you
will
decide
what
is
a
reasonable
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
present
governor
revokes
it.
what
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
issues
an
executive
order
and
says,
by
this
order
i
revoke
any
alleged
signed
paper
you
have
on
your
stationery
that
a
former
governor
signed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
he
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
sure
would
standing
states'
rights
up
on
its
edge
if
you
say
that
the
federal
government
can
tell
a
governor,
you
can't
sign
a
paper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand.
i
wasn't
trying.
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
seems
to
have
a
little
confusion
about
it.
at
page
26a,
they
recite,
"north
dakota
contends",
and
so
forth,
"and
that
any
previous
consent
has
been
revoked
by
governor
link.
"
perhaps
the
attorney
general
will
be
able
to
clear
that
up
for
us
later
on.
