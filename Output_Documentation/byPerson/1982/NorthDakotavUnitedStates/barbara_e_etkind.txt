ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
begin,
if
i
may,
with
a
few
concerns
that
were
raised
during
general
wefald's
argument.
with
respect
to
your
question,
justice
blackmun,
about
prospective,
retrospective
revocation,
i
just
want
to
make
clear
we
believe
that
it
is
a
prospective
revocation
here.
he
is
retrospectively
revoking
those
consents
that
have
been
given,
even
though
they
have
not
yet
been
exercised
by--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--well,
i
would
say...
we
would
be--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--we
would
be
very
pleased
if
the
consent
had
ever
been
revoked,
but
i
feel
constrained
to
show
you
that
in
a
stipulation
filed
in
the
district
court,
north
dakota
took
the
position
that
the
consents
could
be
cancelled
and
in
fact
had
been
cancelled.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
they
were
not
specific,
but
i
think--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--okay.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
we
would
say
that
we
have
the
consent
of
governor
guy,
governor
link,
and...
of
governor
guy
and
governor
link,
and
that
they
remain
outstanding.
but
as
general
wefald
explained,
governor
olsen
is
ready
to
revoke
those
consents,
and
in
fact
i
think
that
it
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
state's
position
all
along
that
they
have
been,
that
they
have
been
revoked.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes.
page
71
and
72,
the
top
of
page
72,
right
before
the
paragraph
numbered
4.
i
would
also
like
to
take...
to
point
out
in
contrast
to
the
implication
that
the
united
states
was
overreaching
the
state
of
north
dakota
when
we
first
went
to
get
these
consents,
as
was
pointed
out,
governor
guy
had
an
opportunity
to
sign
any
sort
of
consent
he
wanted
to
sign.
in
fact,
with
respect
to
our
fee
acquisitions,
he
explicitly
kept
the
right
to
consent
on
an
acquisition
by
acquisition
basis,
and
if
he
had
wanted
to
do
so
with
respect
to
fee...
with
respect
to
easements,
he
could
have
done
that
as
well.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
believe
that
the
legislature
of
north
dakota
could
do
that
on
a
prospective
basis.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
believe
that
the
governor
needed
authority
under
state
law
to
consent,
and
if
he
did
not
have
that
authority,
then
he
could
not
make
the
consent.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
but
it
recites
their
position--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--that's
right,
but
in
19--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--i
understand
that.
in
the
papers
in
the
district
court,
the...
north
dakota
took
the
position
that
our
declaratory
action
judgment
action
was
not
right
on
the
ground
that
the
gubernatorial
consents
had
been
revoked,
and
since
we--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--the
state...
at
that
point,
the
state
was
relying
on
a
1979
statement
by
governor
link.
now,
he
said
in
that
statement,
i
will
not
consent
to
any
further
wetland
acquisitions.
we
explained
in
our
brief
that
we
think
that
is
ambiguous,
but
i
think
the
fair
understanding
of
what
he
was
saying
is
that
he
viewed
the
consents
that
already
were
in
effect
not
to
be
in
effect,
and
he
wasn't
going
to
revitalize
them.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
i
think
they
are
more
like
alternative
arguments
than
ambiguous.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
right,
but
i
think
they
were
trying
to
make
alternative
arguments.
north
dakota
has
come
to
rely
more
and
more
on
its
argument
that
even
if
its
governor's
consent
cannot
be
revoked,
the
united
states
already
has
acquired
more
acreage
than
the
governors
already...
ever
approved,
but
the
state
did
not
present
this
issue
in
its
jurisdictional
statement,
and
it
therefore
cannot
rely
on
it
before
this
court,
nor
is
that
issue
fairly
comprised
within
the
issues
that
were
presented.
and
in
any
event,
the
contention
is
specious.
it
is
because
of
the
peculiar
nature
of
waterfowl
production
area
country,
that
is,
lands
that
have
been...
that
are
characterized
by
numerous
small,
scattered,
and
irregularly
shaped
wetland.
the
secretary
early
on
adopted
the
practice
of
acquiring
easements
covering
all
of
the
wetlands
occurring
on
a
given
described
legal
subdivision,
but
while
the
easement
instrument
describes
a
legal
subdivision,
the
easement
restrictions
which
are
only
on
draining,
filling,
leveling,
and
burning,
expressly
apply
only
to
the
wetlands
occurring
on
that
subdivision.
the
landowner
thus
remains
completely
free
to
utilize
and
dispose
of
the
entire
balance
of
his
land,
that
is,
the
upland,
in
any
way
he
sees
fit.
the
only
conceivable
restriction
on
the
landowner's
use
of
the
uplands,
in
addition
to
not
impeding
the
secretary's
right
of
access
across
them
to
get
to
the
wetlands,
is
that
he
cannot
take
any
action
on
the
uplands
that
would
have
the
expressly
prohibited
purpose
of
draining
the
wetlands.
indeed,
interior's
standard
easement
document
permits
the
landowner
to
farm
even
the
wetlands
when
they
are
dry
of
natural
causes.
as
general
wefald
pointed
out,
the
question
before
this
court
is
a
straightforward
one
of
statutory
construction.
the
duck
stamp
act
authorizes
the
united
states
to
use
money
from
the
migratory
bird
conservation
fund
to
purchase
small
wetland
and
pothole
areas,
interests
in
them,
and
rights
of
way
to
provide
access
to
them.
when
congress
became
aware
in
the
late
1950's
of
the
ongoing
destruction
of
much
of
the
nation's
wetlands,
it
authorized
the
united
states
to
buy
up
portions
of
these
wetlands
in
order
to
preserve
the
desired
waterfowl
populations
and
distribution,
and
in
1961,
in
the
wetlands
loan
act,
it
authorized
a
$105
million
interest-free
loan
to
the
migratory
bird
conservation
fund
in
order
to
make
possible
a
crash
program
of
wetlands
acquisition.
at
the
same
time,
it
provided
that
no
land
shall
be
acquired
with
money
from
the
migratory
bird
conservation
fund
unless
the
acquisition
thereof
has
been
approved
by
the
governor
of
the
state
or
the
appropriate
state
agency.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
intended
that
governors
would
be
permitted
to
revoke
those
consents
once
validly
given.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
we
have
conceded
that
after
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
for
the
federal
government
to
act
on
the
consents,
they...
they
perhaps
could
be
revoked,
but
we
say
that
that
is
not
the
case
here.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no,
it
was
not
the
position
in
the
courts
below,
but
then
we
have
come
a
long
way
from
the
position
in
the...
the
courts
below
held
that
we
didn't
need
to
get
any
consent
whatsoever,
but
we
believe
that
that
flies
in
the
face
of
the
statutory
language,
as
well
as
in
the
face
of
our
consistent
administrative
practice.
ever
since
1961,
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
has
gone
to
the
states
and
has
acquired
consents
for
easements
for
waterfowl
production
areas.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
not
in
the--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--i
don't
know.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
believe
that
we
have
always
done
it
county
by
county,
but
that
is
not
in
the
record,
and
i
can't
say
for
certain.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
right.
we
believe
that
that
question
is
not
presented
here,
because
clearly
here
the
federal
government
has
acted
reasonably
in
not
acting
on
this
consent.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i'm
sorry?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
in
fact,
we
have
not
been
waiting
17
years.
not
all
of
these
consents
were
given
at
the
outset
of
the
program
in
1961.
in
fact,
as
late
as
1973,
governor
link
authorized
the
acquisition
of
more
easement
lands,
and
in
1977
he
authorized
some
adjustments
in
the
acreage.
so
it
hasn't
been
a
full
17...
nearly
a
full
17-year
period.
moreover--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--that's
probably
true,
because
they
weren't
done
on
a
parcel
by
parcel
area.
it's
not...
i
couldn't
say
for
sure,
but
i
would
think
that
there
probably
are
some
areas
in
some
counties
that
have
not--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--to
some...
to
some
acreage.
to
some
acreage,
that's
true.
but
the
moneys
for
our
acquisitions
were
not
appropriated
until...
the
moneys
under
the
wetlands
loan
act
were
not
appropriated
until
the
very
first
instance
was
in
1963,
and
since
that
time
we've
been
operating
within...
we've
been
constrained
by
the
appropriations
from
congress
under
the
wetlands
loan
act
and
under
the
revenues
that
we
get
from
the
sale
of
duck
stamps.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
but
even
within
those
constraints,
regardless
of
who
is
responsible
for
them,
we
have
gotten
consents
from
the
governors
up
to
1.5
million
acres,
and
until
1977
we
exercised
a
full
half
of
those.
we
have
more
than
750,000
acres.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no.
for
one
thing,
as
congress
foresaw,
the
negotiation
process
does
take
some
time.
in
these
programs,
we
only
buy
from
willing
sellers.
we
don't--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--we
have
the
authority,
but
we
have
never
exercised
it.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes.
that,
of
course,
takes
some
time.
as
congress
recognized
when
it
conceived
of
this
program,
it
was
a
huge
program.
it
contemplated
the
federal
government
acquiring
an
additional
two
and
a
half
million
acres
of
land,
and
it
realized
this
was
going
to
take
some
time
to
do.
it
realized
the
type
of
intricate
planning
that
was
going
to
be
involved.
contrary
to
stockpiling
our
consents,
we
have
had
to
plan
out
where
we
are
going
to
buy
these,
what
would
be
the
lands
that
would
be
best
used
by
the
expenditure
of
limited
federal
funds.
the
statutory
language,
of
course,
contains
no
mention
of
revocability.
it
provides
simply
that
no
lands
shall
be
acquired
until
the
acquisition
has
been
approved
by
the
governor
or
appropriate
state
agency.
it
thus
makes
no
provision
for
the
revoking,
qualifying,
or
conditioning
of
any
consent
once
it
is
validly
given.
by
its
express
terms,
all
the
legislation
required
is
that
the
governor
or
state
agency
at
some
point
have
consented
to
the
acquisition.
there
is
no
reason
why
this
plain
language
should
not
prevail.
particularly
since
in
the
absence
of
explicit
legislation,
the
united
states
does
not
need
a
state's
consent
to
purchase
land
within
its
boundaries
at
all,
it
would
seem
that
any
legislatively
imposed
consent
requirement
should
be
narrowly
construed.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
we
believe
the
full
intent
of
congress
should
be,
but
we
believe
that
the
full
intent
of
congress
was
that
the
states
had
a
right
to
withhold
their
consent
at
the
outset
if
that's
what
they
chose
to
do,
or
to
condition
it
prospectively,
but
not
to
revoke
it
once
it
had
been
given.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
from
the
fact
that
in
the
normal
case,
we
would
be
able
to
just
go
into
a
state
and
buy
the
land.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
right,
but
this
is
a
proviso,
a
limiting
proviso
at
the
end
of
a
general
enabling
provision,
and
the
statutory
rule
of
construction
is
that
such
provisions
are
narrowly
construed.
the
legislative
history
bolsters
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
like
the
statute
itself,
the
history
contains
no
mention
anywhere
of
a
right
to
revoke
gubernatorial
consent.
to
be
sure,
congress
intended
that
the
legitimate
concerns
of
the
states
wouldn't
be
ignored,
and
therefore
it
required
the
united
states
to
obtain
prior
gubernatorial
consent,
but
the
main
thrust
of
the
legislative
history
is
congress's
concern
with
the
urgency
of
the
need
for
the
federal
acquisition
of
wetlands.
as
i
mentioned
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
the
congress
knew
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
federal
government
to
bring
about
a
program
of
this
magnitude
without
meticulous
long-range
planning,
and
it
would
have
been
wholly
inconsistent
with
that
recognition
for
congress
to
have
intended
the
governors
would
be
free
to
revoke
their
consents
once
validly
give,
at
least
until
the
united
states
had
had
a
reasonable
time
to
act
on
them.
the
secretary
must
be
able
to
rely
on
the
continued
effectiveness
of
gubernatorial
consent,
at
least
for
a
reasonable
time,
in
order
to
obtain
the
optimal
amount
and
the
type
of
wetlands
in
the
configurations
and
in
the
areas
that
will
most
further
congress's
goal
of
protecting
and
preserving
waterfowl
populations
and
distribution.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
i
don't
think...
well,
for
one
thing,
our
argument
doesn't...
this
case
doesn't
require
finding
that
the
states
can
revoke
after
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
since...
if
you
agree
with
me
that
we
have
not
been
unreasonable
here.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
the
question
of
the
reasonableness?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
think
the
court
can
look
to
the
state
of
the
record
just
in
the
sense
of
how
many
acquisitions
we
have
made,
with
how
much
money,
over
the
period
of
time.
i
think
it's
a
question,
not
necessarily
one
of
a
certain
number
of
years.
in
some
contexts
perhaps
20
years
would
have
been
unreasonable,
if
we
had
had
these
consents
and
there
were
no
barriers
to
our
purchasing
the
easements,
but--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--in
the
ordinary
course,
perhaps
that
would
be...
that
would
be
the
thing
that
would
be
done.
we
submit
that
isn't
necessary
to
do
here,
and
we
further
submit
that
any
further
delay
in
this
case
would
be
unfortunate.
as
congress
recognized,
and
is
continuing
to
recognize,
these
wetlands
are
disappearing
very
quickly.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
if
the
secretary
could
not
rely
on
the
continued
effectiveness
of
gubernatorial
consents,
he
would
be
forced
to
purchase
immediately
any
land
that
he
could
as
soon
as
the
governor
had
consented
to
its
acquisition,
last
that
consent
be
withdrawn,
without
being
able
to
weigh
the
relative
merits
of
potential
acquisitions
that
would
have
to
be
purchased
out
of
very
limited
federal
funds.
in
addition,
if
the
secretary
could
not
count
on
the
continued
effectiveness
of
the
consents
he
received,
federal
resources
would
be
wasted
in
the
negotiations
of
acquisitions
that
ultimately
could
be
frustrated
by
gubernatorial
revocation.
moreover,
permitting
governors
to
revoke
their
consents
would
seriously
delay
and
therefore
ultimately
frustrate
the
purpose
of
the
program
as
a
whole,
the
acquisition
of
wetlands.
in
each
case
of
revocation,
the
planning
and
negotiation
processes
would
have
to
begin
again.
in
turn,
in
view
of
this
rapid
shrinkage
and
destruction
of
the
nation's
wetlands,
and
the
continued
escalation
of
the
cost
of
acquiring
them,
any
delay
in
acquisition
would
necessarily
result
in
the
ultimate
acquisition
of
fewer
acres
of
wetlands.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
because
we
needed
their
consent,
and
once
they
said--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--after
1977?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
they
refused
to
give
it
after
1977.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
there
was
no
question
that
they
were
refusing
to
give
it.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
as
i
said
before,
i
believe
it's
been
north
dakota's
position
that
it
has
revoked.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
governor
link
said
in
1979
that
he
would
not
consent
to
any
further
wetland
acquisition.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
he
was
tieing
it
to
the
garrison
diversion
project,
which...
it's
a
completely
different,
completely
separate
matter.
there
have
been
numerous
disputes
between
the
federal
government
and
north
dakota,
and
in
a
sense
the
wetlands
acquisition
program
has
sort
of
been
held
hostage
to
the
resolution
of
those
other
disputes.
there
was
no
question
that
we
were
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
any
more
land
and
that
they
weren't
going
to
consent
to
that.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
don't
think
that's
the
case.
i
think
it
was
just
so
clear,
there
was
such
hostility,
the
state
was
not
going
to
consent
to
any
more.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
that
was
done
with
respect
to
fees,
yes.
since
1977
no
fees
have
been
authorized
and
they
have
been
returned
to
the
state
to
ask
for
action
on
them,
and
they
were
refused.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
they've
been
refused
since...
they
were
returned
in
'79,
so
they've
been...
i'm
not
sure
when
olson
took
over.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes.
they
have
not
been...
they
have
not
been
given.
whether
in
fact
he
signed
something
that
said
"declined",
i
don't
know.
but
he
certainly
didn't
approve
them,
and
we
gave
them
for
his
approval.
the
have
never
been
approved.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
we
believe
that
we
did.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
he
consented
to
any
wetlands.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no,
the
word
is
not
there.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
perhaps
they
could
have
been
more
artfully
drawn.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
oh,
i
do
think
that
is
unreasonable.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
the
court
can
decide
what
is
a
reasonable
time.
but
i
think
that
as
long
as
the
federal
government
has
been
actively
pursuing
this
program
of
acquiring
the
wetlands,
which
it
certainly
has...
the
only
reason
we
haven't
been
getting
anything
from
'77
'til
now
is
because
of
the
state's
refusal
to
allow
us
to...
i
think
that
qualifies
as
reasonable.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
if
the
present
governor
revokes?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
think
we
can't
purchase,
if
he
could,
if
he
had
the
power
to
revoke
and
he
revoked.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
believe
that's
exactly
the
question
before
this
court.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no,
he
cannot
do
it.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
we
believe
we've
taken
him
to
court.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i'm
sorry?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
an
injunction
outstanding.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
would
hope
so.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
you
can't
revoke.
you
can't
revoke
something
something
you've
already
give.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
think
that's
an
accurate
reflection
of
the
stipulation,
and
i
think
it's
an
accurate
reflection
of
the
way
this
case
has
been
litigated
all
the
way
through.
i
firmly
believe
that
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
there
has
been
a
purported
revocation
by
the
governor,
as
well
as
by
the
legislature.
once
it's
established
that
section
715(k)(5)
does
not
permit
revocation
of
consent,
at
least
for
reasonable
period
of
time
after
the
consent
has
been
given,
it
follows
that
the
northern
dakota
statutes
at
issue
here
as
applied
to
previously
given
but
not
yet
exercised
gubernatorial
consents
also
are
invalid
under
the
supremacy
clause
as
partial
revocations
of
the
previously
given
consent.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that
i
could
go
ahead
and
purchase
it?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
the
federal--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--the
legislation
itself
works
at
least
a
partial
revocation
of
the
prior
consent.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
it's
our
position
that
they
don't
have
to
comply
with
it,
that
the
'77
legislation
is
void.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
right.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
if
you
agree
with
us
that
the
governor...
i
mean,
if
you
disagree
with
us
and
you
say
that
the
governor
can
revoke,
then
i
believe
that
we
would
have
to
comply
with
the
state
statute.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
oh,
clearly,
yes.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
if
that
consent
is
valid,
which
we
believe--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--exactly.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that
is
equally
invalid.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
right.
it
was
submitted
together
with
the
other
language.
i
mean,
it
was
submitted
in
response
to
this
same
federal-state
problem.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
i
think
there's
two
problems
with
it.
one
is
that
if
you
agree
with
us
that
the
consents
we
already
have
are
valid,
then
that
would
be
a
partial
revocation
of
that
consent
because
the
consents
we
have
allow
us
to--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--well,
we
would
say
that
those
statutes
that
were
in
effect
at
the
time
the
consent
was
given,
but
not
after-enacted
statutes.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
i
think
that
would
be
on
a
different
footing,
because
this
particular
statute
has
a
particularly
adverse
impact
on
the
acquisition
program.
in
a
related
context,
when
congress
amended
the
migratory
bird
conservation
act
in
1976
to
permit
the
secretary
to
purchase
easements
as
well
as
fees
for
wildlife
refuge
purchases,
it
made
clear
that
he
should
make
every
effort
to
obtain
permanent
easements
rather
than
lesser
interests,
because
such
an
approach
was
in
the
best
interest
of
the
habitat
and
the
migratory
water
fowl
involved.
that's
in
the
legislative
history,
the
house--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--that's
not
true.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
the
vast
majority
of
our
easements
are
perpetual
easements.
i
was
told
by
interior
99
percent,
but
that
is
not
in
the
record.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
what
is
in
the
record
is
reflected
in
our
brief.
0....
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
in
particular,
north
dakota
centennial
code
section
20.10218.3
purports
to
suspend
gubernatorial
consent
to
federal
acquisition
of
any
land
or
interest
in
land
with
money
from
the
migratory
bird
conservation
fund.
now,
since
this
provision
amounts
to
a
straightforward
revocation
of
consent,
it
is
void
as
inconsistent
with
federal
law
for
the
reasons
i've
already
discussed.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
