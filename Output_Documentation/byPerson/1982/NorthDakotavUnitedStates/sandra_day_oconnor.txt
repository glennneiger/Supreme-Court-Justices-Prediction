justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
do
have
the
unused
consent
forms
from
previous
governors,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
and
you
are
taking
the
position
now
that
maybe
those
have
been
completely
used,
and
furthermore,
you
are
taking
the
position
that
maybe
the
original
consent
was
not
sufficiently
specific,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
make
those
arguments
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
are
we
hearing
those
for
the
first
time
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
the
specificity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
make
the
argument,
attorney
general?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
those
larger
acreages
paid
for
out
of
the
fund?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
legislation
in
your
view
require
the
consent
of
the
governor
or
the
state
agency
only
for
acquisitions
out
of
the
fund?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
is
that
stipulation?
is
that
the
stipulation
on
page
71?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
the
joint
appendix?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
taking
the
position
that
the
consent
can
be
revoked
within
a
reasonable
time?
and
if
so,
why?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
on
what
do
you
base
that
theory?
the
reasonable
time?
and
has
it
always
been
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
waiting
17
years?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
waiting
17
years
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
there
is
some
tension
in
your
argument
that
the
statute
has
to
be
narrowly
construed,
and
yet
we
should
interpret
is
as
giving
the
state
a
reasonable
time
within
which
to
revoke,
but
19
years
is
not
a
reasonable
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
a
question
that
perhaps
this
court
isn't
equipped
to
decide.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
you
took
the
position
that
at
least
compliance
prospectively
was
required.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you've
taken
the
position
that
the
legal
effect
is
they've
been
revoked.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
the
position
you've
taken
throughout
this
litigation
until
this
afternoon,
right?
