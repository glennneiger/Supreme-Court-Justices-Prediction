general
wefald--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
found
the
record,
or
the
opinions,
at
least,
a
little
skimpy
as
to
exactly
what
each
of
these
two
stages
consist
of.
the
first,
i
gather,
is
getting
consent
from
the
governor.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
given
on
a
county
by
county
basis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
does
the
government,
the
federal
government,
or
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
simply
come
in
with
the
sort
of
consent
form
that
appears
on
page
3
of
the
joint
appendix?
does
it
come
in
with
that
along
with
a
map
showing,
you
know,
how
much
in
kidder
county
is
being
taken,
or
does
the
governor
simply
sign
these
without
having
any
map
before
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
the
governor's
problem,
i
suppose.
i
mean,
if
he
hadn't
wanted
to
sign
the
consent,
he
could
have
said,
show
me
some
maps.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
say
we
should
appoint
a
guardian
for
the
state
of
north
dakota.

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--general,
you
talk
about
the
governor's
giving
the
government,
giving
the
federal
government,
as
if
the
government
were
kind
of
conveying
state
lands,
but
i
take
it
after
the
governor
consents,
that
just
opens
up
the
acquisition,
or
if
the
law
provides
for
a
condemnation
process.
the
government
still
has
to
go
to
individual
owners
in
the
state
of
north
dakota
and
then
pay,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
you
are
saying
is
that
what
the
government
has
already
acquired
from
individual
owners
under
these
consents
should
be
inviolate,
but
as
to
land
for
which
consent
is
still
outstanding,
but
where
the
interest
in
the
land
hasn't
been
acquired
from
the
individual
owner,
as
to
that,
the
consent
should
be
revocable.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
any
of
governor
guy's
or
governor
link's
successors
in
office
attempted
to
revoke
the
consent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
have
there
been
things
other
than
specific
document
signings
that
might
indicate
an
intent
to
revoke?
there
has
been
a
statute,
hasn't
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
etkind--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--supposing
that
the
1977
statute,
instead
of
reading
the
way
it
did,
said
that
the
legislature
of
north
dakota
hereby
cancels
the
consent
previously
given
by
governors
guy
and
link
and
forbids
any
future
governor
of
north
carolina
from
ever
entering
into
such
consents.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
governor
can
speak
for
the
state,
presumably
the
legislature
can
restrict
his
authority
to...
under
federal
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
there
some
consents
executed
by
governor
guy,
who
was
the
one
that
executed
them
in
the
early
sixties,
i
take
it,
that
still
have
not
been
acquired
by
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
justice
o'connor's
suggestion
of
a
period
of
19
years
would
apply
to
those
particular
ones.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
just
as
the
state,
i
suppose,
has
to
bear
the
responsibility
for
the
failure
of
governor
guy
to
ask
for
a
copy,
if
he
didn't,
i
suppose
the
federal
government
has
to
bear
the
responsibility
for
the
failure
of
congress
to
appropriate
money.
i
mean,
that
can't
inevitably
be
a
defense
to
conduct
that
would
otherwise
lead
to
a
forfeiture
or
a
divestiture
of
a
claim.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but...
what
have
you
done,
stockpiled
the
other
half?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
have
the
authority
to
condemn?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
never
used
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
that?
yes.
why
shouldn't
the
full
intent
of
congress
be
given
expression
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
was
curious
about
where
you
derived
the
principle
of
narrow
construction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
congress
has
said
this
isn't
going
to
be
the
normal
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
you
ordinarily
have
a
hearing
before
some
fact-finder
on
a
question
such
as
reasonableness,
though,
with
the
focus
being
on
the
sort
of
issues
you
say,
rather
than
just
kind
of
gleaning
from
a
record
that
was
devoted
to
focusing
on
other
issues
what
you
can
about
reasonableness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nineteen
years
is
fine,
but
20
would
be
fatal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
etkind,
why
is
this
one
thing,
this
one
question
of
whether
the
present
governor
or
perhaps
his
predecessor
will
or
will
not
consent,
will
or
will
revoke,
so
obscure
in
this
record?
i
get
the
impression
both
from
you
and
your
opponent
that
both
of
you
perhaps,
or
your
clients
perhaps,
pretty
much
tiptoed
around
actually
going
to
governor
link
or
governor
olson
and
saying,
you
know,
will
you
revoke
or
will
you
consent.
am
i
wrong?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
argument
on
direct
you
said
they
weren't
revoked,
i
thought.
