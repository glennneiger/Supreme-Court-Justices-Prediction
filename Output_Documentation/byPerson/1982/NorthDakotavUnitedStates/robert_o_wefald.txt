mr.
robert
o.
wefald
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
appeal
involves
a
statutory
construction
of
the
word
1961
and
the
constitutionality
of
certain
north
dakota
statutes
believed
by
the
united
states
to
unconstitutionally
interfere
with
the
acquisition
of
wetland
easements
for
waterfowl
production
areas
in
north
dakota's
prairie
pothole
region
covering
central
and
northwest
north
dakota.
three
issues
developed
at
the
proceedings
below.
briefly,
these
are
as
follows.
first,
the
united
states
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
action
that
these
several
north
dakota
laws
are
unconstitutional.
second,
the
district
court
held
that
these
laws
are
unconstitutional,
and
that
no
consent
is
required.
third,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
held
not
only
are
these
laws
unconstitutional
and
that
no
consent
is
required,
but
that
consent
is
present
here
and
cannot
be
revoked.
as
you
will
see,
the
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
north
dakota
has
been
narrowed
through
several
concessions
made
by
the
united
states
in
its
brief.
the
united
states
has
conceded
that
consent
is
required,
but
that
consent
can
be
revoked
after
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
and
that
some
of
the
challenged
laws
are
constitutional,
and
that
others
are
constitutional
only
insofar
as
they
cover
future
acquisitions
of
wetlands
in
excess
of
those
wetlands
not
yet
acquired
under
consents
the
united
states
claims
to
hold.
let
me
first
deal
with
the
question
of
consent,
including
whether
it
is
required,
whether
it
has
been
revoked,
and
whether
it
has
been
exhausted.
i
then
want
to
deal
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
north
dakota
laws
in
question.
our
argument
today
is
staged
against
the
backdrop
of
our
position
that
the
acquisition
of
these
wetlands
involves
two
separate
and
disinct
steps.
first,
consent
must
be
obtained
from
our
governor.
second,
easements
must
be
governed
by
the
real
property
law
of
the
state
of
north
dakota.
let
me
point
out
that
we
are
talking
here
about
easements,
not
fee
land.
secondly,
i
want
to
point
out
that
consent
seems
to
be
the
main
issue
as
opposed
to
the
unconstitutionality
of
our
laws,
because
the
united
states
has
essentially
taken
the
position
that
our
laws
basically
constitute
a
condition
of
prior
gubernatorial
consent,
and
to
that
extent
it
cannot
fall
through
on
the
revocation
that
we
cannot
do
it.
in
other
words,
the
governor
says...
the
united
states
says,
you
cannot
revoke,
you
cannot
condition
your
laws.
let's
first
of
all
talk
about
the
consent
and
the
first
concession
on
pages
12
and
16,
particularly
footnote
11
of
the
united
states'
brief
on
page
16.
i
think
that
concession,
our
brief
adequately
sets
forth
the
laws
we
are
talking
about
and
the
particular
error
made
by
both
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
where
they
held
that
the
gubernatorial
consent
provision
simply
doesn't
apply,
and
i
think
that
is
adequately
taken
care
of,
and
i
will
not
be
addressing
that
particular
point.
let's
talk
now
about
the
consent
and
the
revocation
of
the
consent.
the
revocation
we
are
talking
about
here
is
prospective
only.
north
dakota
does
not
assert
that
the
consent
of
our
governor
to
the
acquisition
of
these
wetland
easements
is
retroactive.
we
are
only
talking
about
prospective.
this
bill,
the
wetlands
loan
act
of
1961--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
765,000,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
there
is...
that
the
governor
of
our
state
has
the
right
to
say,
i
hereby
no
longer
consent
to
the
acquisition
of
any
easements.
what
the
united
states
is
suggesting
is
that
somehow
in
the
early
sixties,
1961
through
'64,
and
again
in
the
early
seventies
with
governor
link,
that
certain
consents
were
signed,
and
that
those
consents
are
irrevocable.
now,
an
example
of
that
consent
is
found
on
the
joint
appendix,
page
3.
a
couple
of
things
to
notice
about
that
consent
form,
first
of
all.
that
was
prepared
by
the
fish
and
wildlife
service.
that
document
is
on
official
wildlife
service
letterhead.
the
united
states
says,
well,
it
says
unequivocally
in
there
that
the
governor
consents,
and
it
doesn't
say
that
he
says,
i
am
reserving
the
right
to
revoke.
query:
if
the
united
states,
the
fish
and
wildlife
service,
as
the
drafter
of
that
instrument
had
wanted
to
be
clear
that
the
governor
could
not
revoke,
couldn't
they
have
out
into
their
instrument,
this
should
be
irrevocable?
and
query:
do
you
think
our
governor
would
have
signed
it
under
that
circumstance?
i
doubt
it.
and
that's
the
issue
here.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
he
certainly
was,
a
good
governor.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
so
he
signed
a
document
prepared
by
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
that
said,
we
are
now
going
to
be
consenting
to
the
acquisition
of
easements
in
north
dakota.
he
has
also
signed
an
affidavit
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
that
says,
i
am...
i
never
intended
to
relinquish
my
right
to
approve
from
time
to
time.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
you
raise
an
excellent
question,
justice
rehnquist.
when
these
signings
took
place,
we
don't
know
exactly
what
the
governor
had
before
him.
we
know
that
there
was
no
specific
indication
as
to
what
particular
potholes,
what
particular
wetlands
were
going
to
be
acquired.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
well,
i
think
if
the
governor's
problem
at
all
was
that
he
believed
that
the
united
states
would
treat
him
fairly
in
this
regard,
and
that
he
put
his
faith
in
the
fact
that
this
acquisition
was
going
to
take
place
over
a
period
of
time.
now,
one
other
thing
to
point
out,
which
is
sort
of
an
interesting
observation.
we
first
discovered
these
consents
for
these
41
counties
in
1979,
when
the
interrogatories
were
answered
by
the
united
states
government.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that
is,
we
don't
have
copies
of
those.
you
see,
they
are
on
official
wildlife
stationery.
they
were
taken
back
by
them.
we
didn't
know
they
existed.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
certainly
we
could
have.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
absolutely
not.
and
we
do
say
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
rely
on
the
federal
government.
these
acquisitions
were
going
to
take
place
over
a
period
of
time.
what
would
the
united
states--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--not
specific
acreages.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that's
it.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
well,
first
of
all--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--sure.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
ah
ha.
he
didn't
go
to
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
and
say,
i
want
to
give
you
a
consent
for
41,000
acres.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
they
came
to
him
and
said,
we
want
you
to
sign
off
on
41,000
acres
of
land.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
and
that'
the...
the
reason
the
united
states
came
to
our
governor
is
because
the
congress
said
that
it
wanted
to
continue
the
partnership
established
in
1959.
i
agree
with
the
position
of
the
united
states
which
is
that
if
congress
had
not
authorized
us
to
consent
by
law
or
our
governor
to
consent,
that
we
would
have
no
right
to
interfere
or
to
be
involved
in
the
acquisition
process
whatsoever,
but
this
federal-state
partnership
was
created
by
the
congress.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
absolutely
correct.
and
that
is
what
they
did
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
governor
had
consented
to
specific
parcels.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
united
states
is
still
ongoing
in
its
acquisition
process,
which
it
was
until
they
abruptly
stopped
on
july
1
of
'77.
they
have
under
those
consents,
if
they
were
to
proceed
ahead,
they
claim
the
right
to
acquire
more
easements.
we
say
you
don't,
because
that
consent
is
revocable
and
our
governor--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--well,
all
we
can
tell
you
today
affirmatively
is
that
they
hold
no
consent
from
governor
olsen
to
go
about
this
business,
and
until
they
hold
a
consent
from
governor
olsen,
they
are
not
authorized
by
this
waterfowl...
wetlands
loan
act
of
1961
to
come
into
our
state
and
acquire
easements
with
the
fund,
with
the
stamp
act
fund.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
they
have...
they
claim
that
they
have
acreages
yet
to
acquire.
they
claim
that
they
have
about
700,000
or
600,000
yet
to
acquire,
yet
they
only
want
to
acquire
20,000.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
as
to
the
specificity--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--the
argument--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--the
argument
with
respect
to
the
acreage
was
made
at
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
i
believe
it
was.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
i
do
not
know.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
no.
now,
with
respect
to
this
consent,
it
goes
back
to
this
federal-state
relationship.
what
we
perceive
is
the
congress
intending
to
create
a
partnership.
we
think
that
we
are
not
the
equal
partner
in
this
relationship.
in
fact,
we
are
not
even
a
junior
partner.
our
status
at
best
is
one
of
a
minority
stockholder
in
a
closely
held
corporation.
we
simply
aren't...
it's
as
if
we
put
our
capital
in
at
one
point
and
all
of
a
sudden
it's
lost
forever.
if
congress--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that's
what
is
suggested
in
the
swan
lake
case.
what
we
are
suggesting--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--we
are
not
suggesting
that
applies
retroactively.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
no.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
they
can
go
ahead.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
right.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
and
that's
what
they
have
done
in
fact,
and
that
is
how
they
get
the
765,000
acres
that
they
are
claiming
that
show
within
the
boundaries
of
4.8,
but
we
will
talk
about
that
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
oh,
i
think
it
is
interesting
with
respect
to
the
question
of
specificity.
i
guess
i
wouldn't
rest
my
entire
case
on
the
specificity
point.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
well,
i
want
you
to
think
about
it,
please.
let's
take
a
look
at
that
consent
again.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes.
well,
whatever.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
ask
some
questions
about
congressional
intent.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
believe
that
congress
in
its
refusal
to
repeal
the
gubernatorial
consent
provisions
over
the
years
has
indeed
intended
that
we
have
an
active
voice
in
this
partnership,
and
in
fact
we
would
be
able
to
consent.
it
is
not
that
the...
the
government
doesn't
contend
that
that
consent
is
irrevocable.
it
simply
says
it
is
irrevocable
only
after
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
it
is
then
revocable.
we
could
have
placed
conditions,
as
has
been
suggested.
would
that
have
made
the
government's
position
any
better
had
we
placed
conditions
on
it?
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that
probably
would
have
been
an
excellent
idea,
but
when
you
trust
the
fish
and
wildlife
service,
you
just
have
to
deal
with
them
as
is.
and
we
did.
we
dealt
in
good
faith
with
the
fish
and
wildlife
service.
we
certainly
didn't
suggest
at
the
outset
that
we
had
to
be
doubtful
about
the
federal
government.
my
goodness.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
federal
government,
we
believe
that
we
have
a
right
to
believe
in
the
good
faith,
and
in
this
particular
case
we
did
put
our
good
faith
into
it,
and
over
time
that
may
not
have
been
warranted.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
well,
let
me
see.
they
do
explain
on
several
pages
in
their
brief,
specifically
14,
25,
26,
and
27,
that
they
consent
can
be
subject
to
revocation
after
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
that
is
the
qualifier
they
put
on
it.
they
don't
say
that
it
simply
can
never
be
revoked.
they
put
a
qualifier
upon
it.
and
i
indeed
agree
that
in
fact
it
is
revocable
and
was
intended
so
by
the
united
states
congress,
and
that
in
fact
the
federal
government
is
not
suffering
any
detriment
whatsoever
by
virtue
of
the
prospective
revocation.
all
they
simply
have
to
do
is
work
with
us.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
the
point
is
simply
this.
the
united
states
today
does
not
hold
a
consent
from
governor
olsen.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
the
answer
is,
no,
they
haven't.
there
is
no
specific
document
signed
by
governor
link,
governor
guy,
or
governor
olsen
that
says,
i
hereby
revoke,
period.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
well,
there
has
been--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--those...
but
those,
interestingly
enough...
the
question
was
with
respect
to
the
governor's
revocation,
and
the
governor
has
not.
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
has
treated
the
enactments
of
1977
as
a
revocation
because
they
said,
these
constitute
conditions
with
which
we
cannot
live.
you
cannot
do
that,
because
you
cannot
revoke.
therefore,
on
the
advice
from
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
we
are
only
going
to
try
to
acquire
this
one
piece
of
land,
and
we
are
going
to
stop
right
here
and
bring
a
lawsuit,
and
not
acquire
any
more
land
until
such
time
as
we
resolve
this
at
this
court.
now,
so
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
united
states
has
treated
it
as
a
revocation,
although
they
do
not
argue
as
such.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
and
in
fact,
the
revocation
that
the
legislature
specifically
imposed
was
a
revocation
of
our
1931
legislative
consent
to
the
acquisition
of
refuges...
lands.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
it
is
simply
the
governor
has
not
consented.
they
hold
no
consent
from
governor
olsen.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
sure.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
no,
they
are
not.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
guy
and
link
are
democrat,
olsen
is
republican.
and
there
are
no...
this...
over
the
years
starting
with
the
kennedy
administration
this
hasn't
been
a
partisan
political
issue.
we
have
been
unilaterally
sort
of
not
had
a
good
relationship
with
all
the
secretaries
of
interior
until
this
year,
and
we
are
very
pleased
with
the
present
relationship
that
we
do
have.
i
wanted
to
note
that
for
the
record.
0
[generallaughter.]
let's
talk
about
the
other
point.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
well,
it
sure
is.
we
are
the
duck
factory
of
america,
and
it
is
indeed
a
big
industry
in
north
dakota.
a
lot
of
hunters
come
in.
and
we
have
done
our
part
since
statehood,
since
the
first
cultivated
land
was
broken
in
north
dakota.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
well,
we
have
some
goose
hunters
and
duck
hunters,
although
i
myself
don't
do
that.
let's
talk
about
this
4.8
million
acres
for
a
moment.
i
want
to
lodge
with
the
court
as
a
part
of
this
argument
this
really
nice
map.
it
has
marked
on
it
in
purple
all
of
the
legal
subdivisions
constituting
this
4.8
million
acres
of
easement,
and
you
take
a
look,
you've
got
to
remember
that
the
total
legal
subdivision...
holding
fee
in
an
easement
is
about
5.3
million.
that
is
8,300
square
miles,
bigger
than
the
entire
state
of
massachusetts,
new
jersey,
et
cetera.
i
must
point
out
in
fairness
that
when
we
show
the
legal
subdivisions
of
4.8
million
acres,
it
is
the
position
of
my
sister
etkind
and
the
united
states
that
the
lands
claimed
directly
by
the
united
states
are
about
765,000
wetland
acres
to
which
they
hold
easements.
our
position
is--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--no,
it
is
basically
information.
it
has
not
been
ever
put
in
as
an
exhibit.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
they
have.
and
that
is
why
i
explained
that
we
have
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
it
shows,
and
what
is
in
there.
i
think
that
as
a
backup
position
with
respect
to
the
question
of
consent
and
the
acquisitions,
that
even
if
it
is
not
necessary
to
address
the
question
of
revocability,
i
think
we
can
successfully
find
that
the
government
has
exceeded
all
of
its
acreage
acquisitions.
they
have
legal
subdivisions
describing
easements
in
north
dakota
totaling
about
4.8
million
acres.
that
is
well
in
excess
of
about
the
1.3
million
acres
that
they
were
authorized
to
acquire
as
shown
in
the
table
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
4
and
5.
incidentally,
we
use
the
figure
of
1.5,
but
i
think
it
is
closer
to
1.3,
because
there
were
some...
you
are
only
supposed
to
take
the
last
figure
as
shown
on
the
particular
appendix
page.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
no.
they
are
not
paid
for.
unfortunately,
they
take
a
legal
description
to
it,
and
they
claim
to
impose
no
restrictions
on
it
except
that
the
farmer
can
us
it
only
insofar
as
it
does
not
interfere
with
or
violate
the
restrictions
on
wetlands.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes,
and
that
is
what
the
law
specifically
provides.
it
is
just
that
the
congress
put
the
money
into
it,
and
has
continually
put
money
into
that
fund
for
the
purpose
of
making
these
particular
acquisitions,
but
the
united
states
in
this
particular
case
has
acquired
4.8
million
acres,
and
there
are
several
cases
below
that
in
fact
pose...
that
in
fact
bring
all
the
total
legal
subdivision
into
the
national
wildlife
refuge
system
and
not
just
the
waterfowl
production
areas,
and
in
fact
in
the
untried
case
of
towner
v.
key,
on
footnote
14
of
page
19
in
the
united
states'
brief,
the
united
states
in
fact
claims
the
entire
tract
is
part
of
the
national
wildlife
refuge
system,
but
it
says
that
it
is
only
for
access.
let's
take
a
look
at
the
laws
for
just
a
few
moments
here
that
are
alleged
to
be
unconstitutional.
the
laws
basically
are
in
two
groups.
one
is
entitled
47,
and
that's
the
one
that
deals
strictly
with
easements.
that's
the
one
that
says
all
easements
in
north
dakota,
regardless
of
by
whom
held,
will
not
be
in
excess
of
99
years.
no
direction
from
the
united
states
congress
as
to
how
long
these
easements
are
to
be
held.
that
is
simply
an
administrative
determination
by
the
secretary.
at
the
time
the
legislation
was
enacted,
they
were
taking
easements
of
20,
30,
up
to
99
years.
the
secretary
desires
perpetual
easements,
but
that
is
not
required,
and
in
fact
that
is
governed
by
the
law
of
the
state
of
north
dakota.
we
deem
it
not
to
be
an
impediment,
and
we
believe
that
it
should
be
upheld
as
to
constitutionality.
as
to
section
s
of
the
provisions
in
title
20.1,
they
are
in
0218,
18.1,
18.2,
18.3,
somewhat
run
together,
18
is
our
1931
legislative
consent,
and
we
simply
amended
that
to
say
that
if
you
don't
agree
with
us,
that
is,
if
you
don't
go
along
with
the
other
sections,
we
are
going
to
revoke
the
consent.
18.1
simply
provides
for
public
participation
in
the
wetlands
acquisition
process,
public
comment.
i
think
there
is
an
objection
to
the
environmental
impact
statement
type
requirement,
but
as
we
argue
this
case
here
in
the
capital
of
this
great
nation
from
which
nepa
came
and
the
environmental
impact
statements,
surely
it
is
clear
that
there
is
a
right
and
a
good
reason
for
public
participation
and
a
need
for
doing
so,
whether
it
is
at
the
federal
level
or
the
state
level,
and
we
simply
imposed
a
reasonable
and
a
rational
requirement
in
fulfillment
of
our
sovereignty.
the
18.2
law
advises
the
landowners
of
their
right
to
negotiate.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that.
there
can't
be
anything
unconstitutional
about
that.
and
indeed,
the
united
states
concedes
that
that
is
constitutional,
notwithstanding
the
pronouncements
of
the
courts
below.
they
simply
indicate
that
the
constitutionality
is
dubious
insofar
as
that
section
talks
about
after
expanded
wetlands
and
the
right
of
the
farmer
to
drain
those
after
expanded
wetlands
back
down
to
the
original
wetland
parameters.
insofar
as
that
happens,
we
believe
that
unless
the
government
negotiates
specifically
with
the
individual,
unless
the
farmer
knows
of
his
right
to
negotiate
about
the
after
expanded
wetlands,
that
the
government
has
not
made
a
valid
acquisition.
in
other
words,
if
they
want
the
after
expanded
wetlands,
then
they
should
negotiate
with
the
farmer,
and
the
farmer
should
be
free
to
negotiate,
and
i
can't
imagine
that
there
is
anything
unconstitutional
with
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes.
that
is
as
to--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
until
such
time
as
it
is
revoked
by
governor
olsen.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
as
to
the
question
of
the
relationship
between
our
governor
and
our
legislature,
i
believe
that
is
properly
a
matter
for
state
law
and
our
state
courts,
and
is
not
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
it
has
never
been
specifically
revoked
by
governor
guy,
governor
fink,
or
governor
olsen.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
it
could
until
governor
olsen
revokes
it,
which
he
will
do.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes,
but
he
simply
hasn't
had
to
act--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--no,
he
hasn't.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
i
do
not
claim
he
has
revoked
it.
i
have
a
reasonable
expectation
as
to
what
he
will
do
when
i
talk
to
him
about
it,
but
he
has
not
done
so
to
this
point.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes,
sir,
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
just
focus
real
quickly
on
this
questions
of
the
constitutionality
of
our
laws
with
respect
to
the
argument
made
again
in
oral
argument
by
the
united
states.
they
are
suggesting
that
our
laws
are
constitutional
to
any
consents
that
may
go
on
beyond
this
1.3
or
1.5
million
acres.
in
other
words,
our
laws
are
constitutional.
the
only
thing
that
makes
our
laws
unconstitutional
with
respect
to
the
united
states
is
that
insofar
as
they
purport
to
condition
the
acquisition
by
the
federal
government
of
another
600
or
700,000
acres,
that
that
constitutes
a
revocation
or
a
conditioning,
in
that
they
cannot
do
that,
and
that
revocation
or
conditioning
is
indeed
an
impediment
to
us.
the
last
section
that
my
sister
just
mentioned,
18.103,
does
not
revoke,
it
simply
suspends
until
the
federal
government
of
the
united
states
gets
together
or
december
31st,
1983.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
governor
link...
we
cannot
find
a
single
document
where
governor
link
said,
i
revoke
these
consents
signed
by
myself
and
governor
guy.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
the
only
fair
reading
of
that
statement
made
by
governor
link
is
that
it
relates
to
the
fee
lands
and
not
to
the
easements.
let
me
explain
why
this
consent--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--there
is
no
written
document
to
that
effect,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
there's
plenty
of
conduct
to
the
effect,
but
there
is
no
written
document.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes.
the
united
states
has
treated
them
as
revoked.
we
treat
them
as
revoked.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes.
indeed,
and
so
did
the
district
court.
let
me
explain
how
this
came
up--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--well,
they
are
not
revoked
through
an
action
of
our
governor
where
he
signs
a
paper
saying,
i
hereby
revoke
these
particular
previous
consents.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
in
terms
of
the
governor's
signature,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
well,
that's
correct.
let
me
tell
you
what
came
up
at
the
district
court
level,
just
to
clear
this
up.
the
united
states
sued
us.
their
complaint
sought
to
declare
unconstitutional
our
laws.
that's
all.
at
the
end
of
the
oral
argument
the
judge
suggested,
well,
i
don't
think
consent's
necessary.
thereafter
followed
the
stipulation,
in
a
very
curious
order
of
events,
and
it
has
subsequently
snowballed
to
this
particular
point.
thank
you.
