we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
metropolitan
edison
against
people
against
nuclear
energy.
mr.
bator,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
the
question
here
whether
the
act
of
congress
and
congress
itself
intended
that
that
be
a
subject
of
the
inquiry,
rather
than
whether
in
fact
anxiety
is
aroused
by
these
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
maybe--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--what
you
are
saying,
i
take
it,
is
that
you
don't
need
committees
and
parades
and
pickets
to
draw
attention
to
the
vibration
and
the
noise
of
an
airplane
going
over
at
300,
400,
500
feet
or
1,000
feet,
and
that
that
is
quite
a
different
thing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
jordan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
it
not
so
that
psychiatrists
or
psychologist
will
tell
you...
they
have
written
it,
surely...
that
a
subject
like
the
placing
of
pershing
missiles
in
nato
countries
in
europe
causes
great
anxiety
to
some
people,
to
the
point
where
they
can't
cope
with
daily
life
as
a
result
of
the
prospect
of
putting
pershing
missiles
in
germany
and
various
other
places.
does
is
the
rule
of
one
psychiatrist
about
one
or
two
or
three
patients
control
these
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
people
don't
want
this
plant
at
this
site
at
all.
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
thought
was
directed
at
the
presidential
commission
comments
that
you
reported,
widespread
apprehension.
was
that
apprehension
any
different
from
the
widespread
apprehension
that
was
aroused
by
a
campaign
on
fluoridation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
get
to
that,
tell
us
how
many
people
were
injured
and
how
many
people
were
killed
in
that
accident.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
you--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--i
thought
you
had
argued
initially
that
this
health
damage
comes
from
anxiety,
apprehension,
and
fear.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
evidence
is
there
that
this
physical
change
has
occurred
independent
of
what
you
had
argued
initially,
that
it
is
anxiety,
apprehension,
and
fear
generated
by
the
fact
of
the
accident?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
said
that
was
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anxiety,
apprehension,
and
fear.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
change
justice
powell's
hypothetical.
not
25
miles
away,
but
suppose
they
decide
they
are
going
to
just
make
this
three
mile
island,
that
whole
plant
a
museum,
close
it
except
as
a
museum,
take
all
the
dangerous
materials
out
of
it,
and
let
visitors
come,
but
right
alongside
of
it
they
are
going
to
build
a
new,
presumably
safer,
modern
plant.
then,
i
put
to
you
the
question
justice
powell
put
to
you.
would
you
have
the
same
objections
to
that
new
plant
that
you
have
to
reopening
the
old
one,
when
it
is
right
next
door,
200
yards
away?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
bator?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
justice
rehnquist.
