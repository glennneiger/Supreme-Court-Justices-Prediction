mr.
bator,
i
think
that
i
am
having
some
difficulty
understanding
the
line
that
you
want
to
draw
here.
if
you
concede
that
psychological
concerns
could
be
the
proper
subject
of
an
inquiry
in
the
case
of
fluoridation
of
water
or
a
lead
poisoning
situation,
how
do
you
differentiate
that
from
this
situation?
what
is
the
line
that
you
draw
in
saying
that
it
should
be
considered
in
some
instances
but
not
others?
is
it
because
in
this
instance
you
argue
that
it
has
been
concluded
that
it
it
safe
to
physical
health
to
restart
it,
and
therefore
it
is
only
the
anxiety
factor?
what
is--

why
isn't
the
construction
of
housing
a
physical
change?
i
just
don't
follow
your
argument
at
all.
