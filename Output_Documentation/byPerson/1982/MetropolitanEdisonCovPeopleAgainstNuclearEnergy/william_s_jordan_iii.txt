mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
quoting
to
the
presidential
commission
on
the
accident
at
three
mile
island,
"that
accident
was
the
worst
crisis
yet
experienced
by
the
nation's
nuclear
power
industry.
"
"it
resulted
in
the
evacuation
of
tens
of
thousands
of
people
who
lived
in
the
area
surrounding
three
mile
island.
"
and
the
president's
commission
found
that
the
most
serious
health
effect
of
that
accident
was
severe
mental
stress
to
that
population.
pane,
my
clients
here,
is
an
organization
of
local
citizens
who
have
lived
and
worked
in
the
three
mile
island
area
for
many
years,
often
for
generations.
pane
has
alleged
before
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
that
the
restart
of
tmi
1
would
cause
further
health
damage
to
this
traumatized,
sensitized
population.
the
factual
allegation
has
never
been
challenged.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
nepa
requires
the
nrc
to
consider
the
health
damage
in
the
unique
circumstances
of
three
mile
island
in
reaching
a
decision
on
the
restart
of
tmi
1.
indeed,
the
commission
itself
has
issued
a
policy
statement
implementing
the
court's
decision
in
which
the
commission
interprets
that
decision
to
require
consideration
of
psychological
health
damage
only
where
there
has
been
a
nuclear
accident,
and
where
there
has
been
a
traumatized
population,
circumstances
directly
comparable
to
those
now
before
the
court.
they
are
discussed
at
page
42
of
our
brief.
we
believe
the
commission's
interpretation
and
application
of
that
lower
court's
decision
is
entirely
reasonable.
in
fact,
we
would
be
satisfied
if
the
commission
would
simply
implement
its
policy
statement
here.
but
this
case
turns
on
the
language
of
section
102(2)(c)
of
nepa.
that
section
requires
environmental...
federal
agencies
to
prepare
environmental
impact
statements
with
respect
to
major
federal
actions
significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment.
that
is
the
trigger
for
when
an
eis
must
be
prepared.
there
is
a
two-part
test.
first,
there
must
be
an
effect
on
the
quality
of
the
human
environment.
second,
that
effect
must
be
significant
under
the
goals
and
the
purposes
of
nepa.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
it
is
in
the
appendix
at
the
end
of
our
brief,
i
believe
the
first
item
in
the
appendix
there.
and
i
believe
it
is
on
the
second
page
of
that
appendix.
i
am
not...
it
is
102(2)(c).
this
dispute,
as
you
have
just
heard,
is
centered
around
the
question
of
whether
this
health
damage
involves
an
effect
on
the
quality
of
the
human
environment.
we
believe
it
does.
indeed,
we
believe
we
can
accept
the
government's
formulation
of
the
applicable
test
as
it
did
in
its
brief,
its
initial
brief.
there
must
be
an
effect
upon
the
environment
or
propagated
through
the
environment.
i
remind
the
court
that
the
commission
has
just
told
you
they
do
not
dispute
that
psychological
health
damage
is
encompassed
by
nepa
if
the
environmental
nexus
test
is
met.
of
course,
the
environmental
concern,
the
environmental
impact
that
is
of
most
concern
here
is
the
health
damage,
but
that
arises
as
what
the
council
on
environmental
quality
regulations
term
an
indirect
effect.
that
is
in--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--well,
that,
of
course,
would
be
a
matter
for
the
commission
when
the
case
goes
back
there.
in
our
view,
we
believe
that
at
least
one
thing
that
would
alleviate
the
anxiety,
in
fact
prevent
the
anxiety
or...
we
don't
think
that
anxiety
is
really
the
useful
word
here.
the
question
is
psychological
health.
it
would
prevent
the
psychological
health
from
occurring
if,
in
our
view,
tmi
1
is
not
restarted.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
other
possibilities.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
in
our
view,
if
you
didn't
start...
if
you
never
started
tmi
1,
the
health
damage
would
never
occur.
it
is
certainly
a
question
of
fact
as
to
what
the
best--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--well,
as
a
matter
of
law
here,
justice
marshall,
the
question
before
the
commission
in
dealing
with
the
facts
will
be
what
is...
what
should
we
do
about
this
health
damage
that
will
occur?
should
we...
what
kind
of
mitigative
action
should
we
take?
and
i
suggest--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--we
would
argue
to
the
commission
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
seriousness
is
so
great
that
in
fact
the
reactor
should
not
be
restarted,
but
i
believe
we
would
also
argue
to
the
commission
that
if
it
did
not
reach
that
determination,
there
are
a
number
of
other
mitigative
actions
that
it
might
take,
and
those
have
been
discussed
by
amicus...
american
psychological
association
in
this
case,
for
example.
some
of
those
involve
treatment
of
individuals,
or
providing
the
health
care
that
is
necessary
to
deal
with
health
damage.
and
i
might
note
to
the
court
that
that
is
exactly
like
an
action
that
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
is
currently
taking
at
two
reactors
with
respect
to
the
damage
of
possible
radiation
health
damage.
they
provide
potassium
iodide
tablets
to
the
population.
that
is
not
making
the
reactor
safer.
that
is
treating
the
individuals.
that
is
very
similar
to
the
kind
of
thing
one
might
do
here.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
no,
i
don't
think
it
does
at
all.
the
question--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--that...
my
clients
would
prefer
that
this
plant
not
restart,
but
that
is
not...
that
does
not
answer
the
question
of
whether
the
one
or
even
ten
psychiatrists
who
all
believe
the
same
thing
control
the
outcome.
they
don't.
that
is
very
much
up
to
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission,
which...
and
in
fact,
i
think...
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
this
is
quite
distinct
from
the
cases
of
where
psychiatrists
are
involved
in
court
proceedings,
such
as
in
insanity
defense
or
something
of
that
sort.
this
is
an
agency
that
has
a
great
deal
of
discretion.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
i
have
never
heard,
your
honor...
that
is
a
question
of
fact
that
i
can't
answer,
but
i
have
never
heard
of
psychological
health
damage
occurring
as
a
result
of
widespread
apprehension
of
fluoridation,
but
i
think
to
take
the
fluoridation
example
it
may
be
useful.
assume
that
we
have
fluoridation
in
the
water,
and
assume
that
it,
like
three
mile
island
unit
1,
the
fluoridation
has
been
ongoing.
then
it
turns
out
that
in
fact
fluoridation
is
dangerous,
and
perhaps
like
dioxin
was
dangerous
at
times
beach,
missouri,
and
then
the
people
are
traumatized,
and
then
we
can
see
that
there
is
psychological
health
damage
in
that
population.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
kind
of
situation
we
have
here.
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
why
it
is
that
this
is
an
environmental
impact.
it
is
not
simply
a
federal
action
that
causes
health
damage.
this
is
an
action
that
changes
the
environment
at
three
mile
island.
there
will
be
the
restart
of
the
reactor,
which
has
its
own
physical
manifestations.
it
has
steam
arising
from
the
cooling
towers,
visible
for
miles.
it
has
low
level
radiation.
it
has
a
number
of
visible
aspects
of
its
operations,
those
all
physical
manifestations.
second--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--sir.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
i...
that
is...
we
are
assuming
there
are
no
changes
in
the
way
the
airport
is
operated.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
the
environmental
effects
are
all
the
same.
and
there
is
no
change
in
the
requirements
related
to
the
airport.
i
would
say
not.
that
is
really
the
issue
that
is
not...
it
is
not
here
that
the
parties,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
have
all
agreed
that
there
is
a
major
federal
action
here
involving
this
restart,
and
the
reason
that
it
is
not
comparable
to
the
airport
starting
up
with
no
changes
in
its
requirements
or
its
operations
is
that
in
this
case,
there
were
substantial
license
amendments
as
a
result
of
the
hearing.
there
were
changes
to
the
operation
of
tmi
1
that
resulted
from
the
experience
at
tmi
2,
the
examination
of
tmi
1,
and
so
on,
and
substantial
license
amendment
changes,
very
similar
to
other
license
amendments,
for
which
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
commission
routinely
does
an
environmental
assessment
to
determine
whether
there
is
an
effect
or
not.
in
fact,
they
did
an
environmental
assessment
here.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
no,
justice
rehnquist.
the
assessment
is,
in
effect,
an
initial
look
at
the
facts,
and
in
this
case,
indeed,
we
are
seeking,
although
it
hasn't
been
called
that,
we
are
seeking
what
is
in
effect
an
assessment.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
yes,
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--absolutely.
the
fact
that
there
was
an
accident
here
is
crucial.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
i'm
sorry?
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
not
at
all.
that
was
exactly
the
point
i
just
wanted
to
get
to.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
the
second--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--yes,
sir.
the
next
point,
of
course.
i
have
given
you
the
first
of
the
physical
environmental
changes,
the
restart
with
its
physical
manifestations.
the
second
is
the
fact
that
there...
it
is
really
combined,
if
you
will.
there
was
an
accident
at
three
mile
island
unit
1,
and
justice
burger
has
asked
how
many
people
were
injured.
i
don't
know
of
any
who
were
killed
or
who
we
know
have
any
sort
of
radiation
physical
injury.
however,
we
do
know
from
the
president's
commission
and
indeed
from
later
studies
that
there
are
a
number
of
people
who
suffer
from
damage
to
their
health,
and
that
is
what
nepa
is
about.
now,
the
issue
here,
of
course,
is
the
restart,
and
the
restart
brings
with
it
the
physical
reality
of
the
potential
for
another
accident.
that
is
a
change
to
the
environment
at
three
mile
island.
it
applies
no
where
else,
and
it
is
inherent
in
the
environment
there.
that
is
what
is
really
the
source
for
the
health
damage.
of
course,
we
have
a
traumatized
population
now
facing
the
possibility
of
another
nuclear
accident
in
their
environment,
and
under
the
ceq
regulations,
i
will
cite
for
you
40
cfr
1508.8(b)
here,
this
is
an
indirect
effect
of
those
first
two
environmental
changes.
as
such,
it
is
an
environmental
change.
i
would
suggest
it
is
cognizable
under
nepa
exactly
as
the
potential
for
cancer
from
some
federal
action
within
an
environment
is
cognizable
under
nepa.
there
was
a
federal
action.
it
results
in
a
change
within
the
environment,
and
health
damage
is
the
result,
and
there
is
no
question
whatsoever
that
any
federal
agency
would
have
to
examine
not
only...
not
only
the
radiation
or
the
amount
of
radiation
that
spewed
forth
from
the
facility,
but
the
resulting
health
damage.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
you
may
have
misread
my
example,
justice
rehnquist.
i
was
not
referring
to
a
drug
that
might
cause
cancer,
but
to
a
federal
facility
that
might
cause
cancer.
i
don't
think
that
distributing
a
drug
causes
an
environmental
effect.
it
is
entirely
different
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
addressed.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
again,
i
think
it
is
important
to
make
the
distinction.
we
are
not
talking
about
covering
fear.
we
don't
care
about
fears,
rational
or
irrational,
that
do
not
constitute
damage
to
health.
so
the
question
is--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--yes.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
really,
that's
a
question
for
a
scientist
to
answer.
my
understanding
is
that
fear
is
a
component
of
it,
and
the
fear
arises
from
the
physical
change
to
the
environment
with
the
result
of
health
damage,
and
i
want
to
answer
your
example
about
whether...
when
there
is
a
possibility
for
cancer
one
must
examine
psychological
health
damage.
and
i
think
the
answer
is,
as
with
any
environmental
issue,
an
agency
need
not
examine
it
unless
there
is
a
reason
to
examine
it.
the
agency
may
say,
we
know
of
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
mere
fact
that
cancer
is
a
possibility
from
this
operation
will
cause
psychological
health
damage.
if
someone
wants
us
to
consider
it,
it
must
make
a
threshold
showing
that
in
fact
there
is
a
likelihood,
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
it
would
occur
here.
that
is
really
what
i
think
vermont
yankee
clearly
authorizes
an
agency
to
do.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
if
people
will
be
psychologically...
their
health
will
be
damaged
by
a
federal
action
affecting
their
environment,
and
there
is
a
real...
a
basis
for
that
showing,
and
the
agency
has
established...
and
in
fact,
i
think
the
agency
here
has
established
a
threshold
showing
requirement
of
the
pre-existing...
a
previous
accident,
of
pre-existing
traumatic
population.
that
is
a
fact
situation
within
the
state
of
the
art
in
which
reasonable
predictions
can
be
made
about
the
likely
psychological
health.
that
is
the
kind
of
threshold
showing
that
an
agency
could
establish.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
well,
and
we
believe
in
fact
if
that...
if
the
showing
is
made--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--the
agency
has
to
respond,
but
it
does
have
the
authority
to
set
that
threshold.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
no,
and
in
fact
i
think
that
gives
us
a
good
place
to
see
the
distinction.
you
go
back
to
the
statute.
is
there
an
effect
on
the
environment?
that
is
the
question.
nepa
is
not
about
the
relationships
among
human
beings.
it
is
about
the
effect
that
the
environment
has
upon
human
beings.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
i
would
suggest
that
that
in
fact
is
not,
and
we
have
argued
in
the
brief
that
that
is
not
a
change
in
the
environment
under
nepa.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
well,
i
think
there
is...
the
bright
line
can
be
drawn
between
that
example
and
the
case
before
you
now.
in
this
case,
we
do
not
have
the
relationships
among
people
that
is
at
issue.
we
have
a
physical
change
within
the
area
where
these
people
live.
a
physical,
not
a
social--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--well,
i
think
the
construction
of
housing...
construction
of
housing
is
a
physical
change,
but
it
has
not
the
slightest
relationship
by
itself
to
the
effect
of
the
psychological
damage.
that
is--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--i
don't
think
the
doctor
would
testify
that
constructing
the
housing
is
what
causes
the
damage.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
well,
what
was
held
in...
assuming
they
were
irreconcilables...
i
don't
think
they
were...
but
in
the
hanly
v.
kleindienst
case,
the
second
of
the
two
hanly
cases,
the
court
held
there
that
the
agency
needed
to
examine
the
likelihood
of
an
increase
in
crime
in
that
neighborhood.
the
increase
in
crime,
as
we
read
it,
arises
not
from
the...
it
arises
not
from
the
construction
of
the
jail
that
was
at
issue
there,
by
which
i
mean
it
doesn't
arise
from
the
bricks
and
the
mortar
and
the
actual
physical
construction
of
the
building.
rather,
it
arises
from
the
change
in
the
character
of
the
neighborhood
that
for
some
reason
promotes
the
crime,
and
crime
is
a
significant
concern
under
nepa
in
the
urban
environment,
and
so
that
is
what
the
court
there
held
has
to
be...
the
court
held
there
that
that
potential
increase
had
to
be
considered.
now,
here,
we
have--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--i
believe
nepa...
certainly
the
legislative
history
does,
and
there
is
no
question
of
that.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
if
i
recall
correctly,
section
101...
i'm
sorry,
section
2,
the
introductory
section,
refers
to
crime.
i
could
be
incorrect.
but
there
is
no
doubt
from
the
legislative
history
that
crime
was
a
concern
of
the
statute,
speaking
in
particular
of
the
urban
environment.
but
we
have
a
case
here
that
is
even
more
physical,
if
you
will,
more
environmental
than
the
hanly
2,
the
jail
character
of
the
neighborhood
case.
we
have
a
case
where
there
is
a
change
in
the
environment.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
certainly.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
okay,
it's
a
new--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--nuclear
plant?
i
think
then
the
question...
you
are
doing
a
very
much
similar
thing
to
restarting
tmi
1.
let's
assume
it
is
right
on
three
mile
island,
on
the
island
itself.
it
seems
to
me
that
probably
the
example
is
the
same.
you
have
to
examine...
you
are
taking...
you
are
doing
exactly
the
same
physical
change
to
the
environment.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
i
can't
tell
you
whether
my
clients
would
oppose
the
construction
of
one
25
miles
away
or
not.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
no,
i...
it
is
whether
the
environment--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--it
is
whether
psychological
health
damage
can
be
expected
to
occur
within
that
environment,
and
i
think
the
question
here
would
be,
it
would
really
be
a
matter
of
fact
as
to
whether
that
had
the
effect
on
these...
this
population
that
tmi
1
has.
you
have
given
the
one
example
that
no
one
else
has
to
me,
which
is,
what
if
you
do
the
same
thing
to
the
same
population,
but
not
with
three
mile
island
unit
1.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
well,
in
fact,
i
suspect
that
generalized
concern
is
greater
than
it
was
before
three
mile
island...
the
three
mile
island
accident
occurred,
but
the
question
is
not
one
of
apprehension
or
even
fear.
the
question
is
psychological
health
damage.
and
i
don't
think
there's
another
community...
someone
living
in
chicago
or
somewhere
else--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--there
is
no
showing
they
would
be
traumatized.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
the
health
damage
arises
as
a
result
of
the
physical
change
to
that
environment,
and
there
is...
fear
is
one
aspect
of
the
cause
of--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--no,
i'm
sorry.
i
may
have
lost
you.
it
is
not...
we
are
not...
we
are
talking
about
two--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--we
are
talking
about
really
two
points
at
which
trauma
occurs,
has
occurred
and,
we
expect,
will
occur.
the
first
is
when
the
accident
itself
happened.
there
is
evidence
in
that
case,
from
the
presidential
commission
and
other
studies,
of
psychological
health
damage.
now
i
am
talking--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--from
what
these
people
lived
through
when
the
accident
occurred.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
anxiety,
apprehension,
and
fear
were
doubtless
among
the
causal
relationships
between
the
physical
occurrence
of
the
accident
and
their
traumatization,
and
they
may
well
have...
in
fact,
they
probably
did
have
exposure
to
low
level
radiation.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
i
can't...
what
all
the
objections
would
be,
i
don't
know,
but
if
the...
the
question
would
be,
would
psychological
health
damage
be
caused,
and
i
must
say
i
expect
that
with
this
existing
traumatized
population,
the
answer
would
be,
yes,
there
is
a
basis
for
saying
in
this
case,
as
we
see
in
no
other,
that
the
psychological
health
damage
must
be
examined
in
that
situation,
but
that's
a
unique
case
of
three
mile
island.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
i
think
we
would,
and
the
reason
that
we
would
is,
you
have
assumed
no
effect
whatsoever.
i
am
afraid
i
will
have
to--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--yes.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
okay.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
i
gave
you
really
a
three-part
test
or
a
three-part
showing
of
environmental
impact
here.
the
first
was
the
initial
impacts
of
operation
of
the
reactor.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
i
think
that
is
what
you
have
just
eliminated.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
you
remain
in
that
environment
with
the
potential
for
an
accident.
unless
you
have
eliminated
that
from
your
hypothesis--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--i
would--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--yes.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
justice
stevens,
we
have
addressed
that
in
our
brief
in
a
footnote,
because
the...
i
believe
it
was
the
utilities
claimed
that
we
were
making
that
argument.
of
course,
in
fact,
we're
not.
our...
the
allegations
that
have
to
be
considered
as
true
here
take
into
account
the
potential
for
the
accident,
so
in
fact
that's
not
the
case
here,
but
assuming
that
it
were
in
some
way
absolutely
impossible
for
that
to
happen,
i
think
that
you
still
have
the
physical
change
to
the
environment
by
virtue
of
the
existence--
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
--um-hm.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
nonetheless,
i
would
have
to
answer
that
by
saying
there
is
still
a
physical
change
even
within
that
reactor.
there
is
a
difference,
and
it
it
locatable
to
three
mile
island
and
no
where
else,
and
the
environment
in
which
these
people
live
becomes
unhealthy
to
them
because
there
is
a
physical
change
in
it,
although
it
is
certain
to
remain
inside
the
reactor,
because
the
question
is
going
to
be
here
psychological
health
damage,
as
we
have
shown,
is
cognizable
under
nepa
and
was
a
concern
of
congress.
in
fact
it
was
in
virtually
the
second
paragraph
of
senator...
statement.
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
i'm
sorry,
justice
marshall?
mr.
william
s.
jordan,
iii
that...
i
don't
see
a
reason
to
say
that.
there
would
be
no...
there
would
certainly
be
nothing...
more
trauma
that
had
already
happened
as
a
result
of
the
unit
2
accident.
again,
we
are,
in
that
case,
we
are...
not
is
the
same
as
the
allegations
that
we
have
made.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
