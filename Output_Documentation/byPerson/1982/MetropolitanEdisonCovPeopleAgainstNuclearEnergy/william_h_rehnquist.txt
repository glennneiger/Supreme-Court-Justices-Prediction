justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
no
question,
is
there,
that
the
impact
statement
would
have
to
consider
the
possibility
of
another
accident?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
the
fact
of
escapes,
the
possibility
of
escapes
from
a
prison
an
environmental
impact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
government's
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
line
that
you
stated
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question
like,
i
suppose,
most
other
lines,
kind
of
blurs
in
places.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jordan,
where
is
that
statute
set
out?
do
you
have
a
handy
reference
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jordan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
government
puts
in
an
airport
right
adjacent
to
a
city,
and
makes
the
environmental
statement
and
so
forth,
and
ultimately
the
airport
is
constructed,
and
there
is
considerable
noise
that
would
have
required
an
environmental
statement,
and
then
the
airport
is
shut
down
for,
say,
six
months
or
a
year.
does
the
government
have
to
file
an
environmental
impact
statement
again
when
it
decides
to
reactivate
the
airport?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
an
assessment
the
same
as
an
eis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
in
your
drug
that
might
cause
cancer
example?
you
say
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
statement
with
respect
to
the
cancer
causing
potential.
would
there
also
have
to
be
a
statement
as
to
the
psychological
fear
that
by
taking
the
drug
you
might
get
cancer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let's
take
the
environmental
impact,
and
the
potential
for
causing
cancer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
environmental
impact
statement
also
have
to
cover
the
psychological
fear
that
cancer
might
be
caused?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
damage
to
health
you
are
talking
about--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--comes
from
fear,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
it
is
quite
amorphous,
really.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
if
a
threshold
showing
were
made
that
psychological
damage
resulting
in
fear
of
the
cancer
were
made,
the
environmental
impact
statement
would
have
to
cover
not
only
the
potential
for
causing
cancer,
but
the
psychological
effect
of
fear
of
cancer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the...
i
take
it...
you
said
the
agency
has
to
respond
to
a
showing
by
a
group
such
as
yours
since
the
agency
certainly
didn't
try
to
establish
the
thing.
it
was
more
or
less
pushed
on
it
by
your
group.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
agency
has
to
respond.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
the
government
is
contemplating
a
public
housing
development
in
a
neighborhood
where
a
great
many
neighbors
oppose
public
housing,
and
genuinely
fear
what
the
effect
of
public
housing
is
going
to
be
on
the
value
of
their
houses,
their
neighborhood,
and
the
like.
now,
could
they
come
into
the
agency
that
was
responsible
for
that
development
and
make
a
showing
from...
say
a
doctor
testifies
that
there
are
genuine
psychological
problems
here.
these
people
are
so
obsessed
with
their
dislike
of
public
housing
that
they
are
going
to
have
psychological
damage
if
it
goes
through.
and
say
the
agency
has
to
consider
that
kind
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
is
certainly
a
change
in
the
environment,
and
the
change
is
thought
by
some...
is
feared
by
some
people,
and
you
can
get
a
doctor
to
testify
that
there
is
psychological
damage.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
is
the
bright
line,
or
at
least
a
gray
line?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
know,
but
the
doctor
testifies
it
does.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
nepa
specify
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
we
know
just
from
the
language
of
the
statute
that
crime
must
be
considered
where
you
suggest
other
things
need
not
be
considered?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
third
is
case
is
nuclear
regulatory
commission
versus
people
against
nuclear
energy
and
metropolitan
edison
versus
people
against
nuclear
energy.
in
march
1979,
the
three
mile
island
nuclear
plant
near
harrisburg,
pennsylvania
suffered
a
serious
acts
that
the
companion
plant
were
shut
down
at
the
time
for
routine
refueling.
after
the
accident,
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
ordered
the
owner
of
the
plants
to
keep
three
mile
island
one
shut
down
until
it
could
be
determined
whether
the
plant
could
be
operated
safely.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
national
environmental
policy
act
requires
the
commission
to
consider
whether
operating
three
mile
island
will
cause
psychological
harm
to
neighboring
residents
before
it
permits
the
owner
to
renew
operations.
respondent,
the
people
against
nuclear
energy,
an
association
of
the
residents
of
the
harrisburg
area
has
contended
the
renewed
operation
of
three
mile
island
will
cause
severe
psychological
health
damage
to
neighboring
residents
because
of
the
risk
of
another
nuclear
acts
and
will
cause
them
to
suffer
anxiety,
tension
and
accompanying
physical
disorders.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
agreed
and
order
of
the
commission
to
consider
people
against
nuclear
energy's
contention.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
unanimously
that
the
national
environmental
protection
act
does
not
require
the
commission
to
consider
pane's
contentions.
the
act
requires
federal
agencies
to
consider
environmental
effects
of
their
actions
not
every
effect.
we
believe
that
congress
meant
to
require
agencies
to
consider
only
those
effects
that
are
reasonably
closely
related
to
a
change
in
the
physical
environment.
in
this
case,
the
harm
pane,
people
against
nuclear
energy,
is
concern
about
is
caused
by
the
risk
of
a
nuclear
accident
by
people's
perception
of
that
risk
is
much
as
by
the
operation
of
the
plant.
we
believe
that
the
act
does
not
encompass
pane's
concerns
because
the
element
of
risks
make
them
too
far
remove
from
the
environment.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
