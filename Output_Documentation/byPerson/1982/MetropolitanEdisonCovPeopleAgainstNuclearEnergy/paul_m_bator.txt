mr.
paul
m.
bator
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
three
mile
island
unit
1
nuclear
power
reactor,
tmi
1.
tmi
1
is
one
of
two
units
at
three
mile
island.
it
was
in
the
other
unit,
tmi
2,
that
the
three
mile
island
accident
occurred
in
march
of
1979.
when
that
accident
occurred,
tmi
1
happened
to
be
shut
down
for
routine
refueling,
and
it
has
been
shut
down
ever
since,
and
this
case
involves
its
restart.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission,
before
it
may
begin...
before
it
may
permit
tmi
1
to
restart,
is
required
by
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
nepa,
is
required
to
make
an
inquiry
in
order
to
predict
whether
and
to
what
extent
psychological
stress
will
occur
on
restart
because
of
the
fear
and
anxiety
of
neighboring
residents
that
there
may
be
a
second
accident
at
three
mile
island.
the
government's
central
contention
is
that
nepa
does
not
require
administrative
agencies
to
conduct
an
inquiry
for
the
purpose
of
predicting
fears
that
their
proposed
actions
may
engender.
the
central
purpose
of
nepa
is
to
require
the
government
to
take
a
hard
look
at
the
impact
of
its
proposed
actions
on
the
natural
environment,
and
on
the
direct
consequence
of
those
interventions,
and
we
argue
that
stress
caused
by
fear
and
anxiety
that
government
action
may
be
harmful
to
you
is
not
an
environmental
impact,
and
is
therefore
not
cognizant.
now,
i
may
give
a
humble
example
to
the
court.
if
the
government
proposes
to
put
massive
amounts
of
fluoride
into
the
water,
of
course,
the
government
must
make
a
scrupulous
inquiry
whether
the
fluoridation
will
be
harmful
or
helpful
to
health.
but
our
contention
is
that
congress
did
not
contemplate
that
a
separate
and
distinct
inquiry
be
made
into
whether
fluoridation
will
cause
popular
anxiety.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
contention
is
that
the
statute,
properly
read,
does
not
require
the
commission
to
make
such
a
subsidiary
and
distinct
inquiry
into
the
question
of
stress.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
this
case
held
that
it
is
not
enough
to
do
what
the
commission
in
this
case
did,
which
is
to
engage
in
an
extensive,
an
exhaustive
inquiry
into
the
question
of
the
safety
of
restart,
taking
into
account
for
that
inquiry
the
painful
lessons
of
tmi
2.
rather,
the
court
ruled
that
apart
from
the
actual
safety
issue,
stress
resulting
from
fears
about
safety
is
an
independent
factor.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
are
saying--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--no,
your
honor.
we
readily
concede
that
psychological
health
is
health.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
our
argument,
justice
stevens,
is
that
there
are
two
sorts
of
health
impairments,
including
mental
health
impairments,
that
must
be
kept
distinct.
if
the
government
intervenes
in
the
environment,
and
the
intervention
itself
directly
causes
health
effects,
including
mental
health
effects,
then
that
consequential
impact
must
be
considered
in
the
nepa
process.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
our
argument,
your
honor,
is
that
the...
maybe
i...
maybe
another
illustration
would
help.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
because
the
role
in
which
mental
health
can
come
in
is
if
there
is
a
direct,
almost
a
traumatic
consequence.
that
is,
if
the
government
proposes
to
build
an
airport,
and
there
would
be
a
tremendous
amount
of
noise
which
would
drive
people
mad,
or
if
the
government
licenses
an
emission
of
lead
that
will
cause
retardation
among
children,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
that
kind
of
mental
health
effect
is
like
other
health
effects.
the
crucial
distinction
between
that
and
this
case
and
the
fluoridation
case
is
the
proposition
about
fear
and
anxiety.
we
don't
think
that
anxiety
produced
by
the
fear
of
an
environmental
impact
counts
as
an
environmental
impact.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
we
believe
it
is
quite
a
different
thing
really
for
a
number
of
very,
we
submit,
very
profound
reasons.
i
would
like
to
take
it
back
to
the
statute,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
key
to
this
case
is
to
ask
the
question,
what
was
the
central
concern,
what
was
the
central
focus
of
this
statute.
this
statute
instructed
the
government
to
pay
more
attention
than
it
had
heretofore
done
to
the
impacts
that
governmental
action
has
on
the
natural
environment.
now,
that's
not
because
congress
was
in
some
abstract
way
worried
about
the
land
and
the
water
and
the
air
and
plant
life
and
animal
life.
of
course,
the
ultimate
purpose
in
worrying
about
those
phenomena
was
to
safeguard
human
health
and
human
welfare.
but
the
central
finding
of
nepa
was
that
insensitivity
to
the
natural
environment
was
dangerous,
might
produce
dangers
to
man's
health
and
welfare.
and
congress
created
a
statutory
structure
that
rather
insistently
says
that
you
must
focus
your
attention
on
the
environmental
impact
of
what
it
is
you
do.
the
statutory
structure,
as
it
were,
puts
two
hurdles
before
the
agency.
it
says
that
the
impact
statement
is
required
only
if
the
proposed
action
has
a
significant
impact
on
the
human
environment,
and
then,
importantly,
the
statute
does
not
just
stop
there.
it
doesn't
say
that
all
the
effects
of
that
impact
must
be
studied,
only
the
environmental
impact
effects
of
that
action
must
be
studied.
now,
we
concede,
your
honors,
that
there
is
a
sense
in
which
the
restart
of
tmi
1
changes
the
environment,
and
respondent
in
this
case
argues
from
that,
well,
they
will
restart
tmi
1,
and
that
is
an
impact...
that
is
a
change
in
the
environment,
and
that
causes
stress,
but
there
is,
we
submit,
a
very
critical
muzzle
in
that
argument,
because
the
stress
is
produced
not
by
the
harmful
consequences
of
the
environmental
impact.
there
is
no
argument
here
that
there
will
be
a
change
in
the
water
or
the
air
which
then
produces
stress
in
any
kind
of
traumatic
way.
the
point
that
is
being
made
is
that
the
stress
is
a
product
of
people's
anxiety
and
fear
that
there
may
be
a
second
accident
here.
that
is
the
impact
that
they
are
worried
about.
now,
we
think
that
the
statute
does
not
require
for
the
government
to
make
this
separate
and
subsidiary
inquiry,
and
we
think
it
would
be
extremely
undesirable
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute
to
require
this
subsidiary
impact.
we
submit
that
it
would
really
dilute
and
confuse
the
environmental
impact
process
if
this
second
order,
rather
confusing
question...
see,
you
go
through
the
first
inquiry,
and
you
say,
is
this
plant
safe?
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
and
in
fact,
did.
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
impact
assessment
that
was
conducted
in
connection
with
this
restart
in
the
joint
appendix,
there
was
an
elaborate
inquiry
made
into
the
question
of
risk.
that
is,
it
is
not
our
argument
that
only
certain
impacts
count.
they
have
to,
and
we
do
consider
the
question
of
whether
restart
creates
the
possibility
of
a
second
accident,
and
that
counts,
because
if
there
is
such
an
accident,
there
would
be
a
dreadful
impact
on
the
environment.
but
we
sharply
distinguish
between
that
inquiry
and
the
question
whether
on
restart
people
will
be
simply
frightened
of
that
accident,
whatever
actual
risks
there
are.
that
is,
our
submission,
your
honor,
is
that
the
intelligent
way
to
deal
with
anxiety
about
accidents
is
to
do
everything
possible
under
the
sun
to
prevent
them
from
happening,
that
is,
that
the
rational
way
to
deal
with
anxiety
is
to
make
this
unit
safe
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
to
do
it
as
openly
as
possible
so
that
everybody
understands
the
facts.
but
to
underlay
that
inquiry
with
a
separate
inquiry
into
the
question
of
what
people's
subjective
perceptions
with
respect
to
safety
are
seems
to
us
to
dilute
the
central
inquiry,
and
we
further
submit
that
it
really
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
environment.
that
is,
anxieties
are
not...
about
safety
are
not
identical
with,
they
are
not
even
necessarily
parallel
with
concerns
about
the
environment.
there
are
human
anxieties
about
government
interventions
that
are
relatively
benign
environmentally.
and
there
may
be
huge
human
anxieties
about
interventions
that
are
not
at
all
benign.
in
other
words,
there
isn't
a
tracking
between
the
anxiety
issue
and
the
environmental
issue.
furthermore,
the
very
process
of
the
rule
announced
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
that
there
must
be...
that
there
is
a
legal
rule
that
administrative
agencies
must
make
a
formal
inquiry
in
order
to
predict
stress
seems
to
us
to
create
a
confusing
and
diluting
side
issue
into
the
real
business
of
these
agencies,
including
their
concern
for
the
environment.
that
is
to
say
that
what
will
happen
here
is
a
fiercely
controversial
struggle
about
proper
methodologies.
we
don't
make
the
point
that
stress
can't
be
measured,
but
it
is
difficult,
and
it
is
controversial,
and
the
methodologies
for
doing
it
are
extremely
controversial,
and
what
will
happen
here
as
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
stands,
your
honors,
we
believe,
is
that
there
will
be
very,
very
elaborate
batteries
of
experts
quarreling
here,
and
a
very
rich
opportunity
for
complicated
procedures
and
complicated
litigation
about
whether
the
proper
methodologies
were
used,
and
whether
the
predicted
stress
was
correctly
and
fairly
measured.
your
honor,
i
will
take
only
one
more
minute
of
your
time.
i
want
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
actual
procedural
history
of
this
case.
this
is
not
a
case
where
shortly
after
the
accident
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
said,
well,
let's
start
up
this
other
plant.
that
plant
shut
down
in
1979.
since
that
time,
there
has
been
an
immense
administrative
proceeding
devoted
to
the
question
whether
it
is
safe
to
start
it
again.
there
were
hearings,
interventions,
written
submissions.
the
oral
hearings
themselves
took
nine
months.
they
generated
a
26,000-page
transcript.
these
hearings
were
devoted
to
the
central
problems
of
this
case,
the
questions
whether
it
is
safe
to
restart
tmi
1.
these
were
questions
of
the
design,
of
management,
of
technical
capabilities,
of
emergency
planning,
all
the
other
questions
which
the
accident
raised
for
tmi
1.
it
was
in
connection
with
these
proceedings
that
the
commission
did...
was
quite
aware
that
it
had
to...
take
account
of
compliance
with
nepa,
and
it
was
clear
from
the
beginning
that
the
stress
question
would
be
a
question
here.
respondent
in
this
case,
a
group
of
residents
near
three
mile
island,
called
people
against
nuclear
energy,
was
the
principal
party
pressing
the
submission
that
stress
and
anxiety
was
an
independent
issue
in
this
case,
and
they
made
contentions
before
the
commission,
and
they
were
the
ones
that
took
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia.
so,
what
we
have
here
is
this
curious
parallel
affair,
the
commission
engaging
in
this
tremendously
complicated
and
scrupulous
process
devoted
to
the
question
of
whether
this
plant
can
safely
be
started
up,
keeping
in
mind
all
the
time
that
we
think
that
that
kind
of
proceeding
conducted
fully
in
the
open
is
the
most
rational
way
to
deal
also
with
the
question
of
anxiety.
and
then
we
have
had
this
subsidiary,
complicated
litigation
devoted
to
the
question
whether
this
other
issue,
this
issue
devoted
entirely
to
people's
subjective
perceptions
with
respect
to
safety,
is
an
independent
issue,
and
that
there
is
a
legal
right
to
have
that
made
an
independent,
formal
subject
of
inquiry.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
justice
o'connor,
the
line
we
would
seek
to
draw
and
that
we
hope
to
persuade
the
court
to
draw
is
really
the
line
that
is
given
to
us
by
the
statute.
the
statute
says,
the
environmental
impact
statement
must
consider
the
environmental
impact
of
government
interventions.
if
health
consequences
are
a
direct
product
of
an
adverse
change
in
the
environment
as
a
result
of
government
intervention...
that
is
our
airplane
case,
that
is
our
lead
poisoning
case...
then
health
effects
come
in.
on
the
other
hand,
we
would
argue
fiercely
that
the
fluoridation
anxiety
is
not
the
kind
of
health
effect
that
has
independent
status,
because
a
stress
effect
that
is
produced
simply
by
anxiety
about
the
environment
is
not
directly
caused,
as
the
statute
requires,
by
an
impact
on
the
environment.
in
other
words,
we
really
think
that
the
statute
contemplates
the
wise
policy
that
this
strung-out
subsidiary
mental
health
effect
be
restricted
to
those
situations
where
it
is
pretty
clear
that
there
is
an
actual
change
in
the
water,
or
the
land,
or
in
the
air,
that
directly
propagates
some
kind
of
mental
health
change.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
there
are
many,
many
government
actions
that
create
anxiety.
if
the
government
licenses
a
dangerous
drug,
that
creates
not
only
anxiety,
it
creates
an
actual
health
danger,
but
the
danger
to
health
is
not
a
product
of
an
environmental
intervention,
and
therefore
it
isn't
under
nepa
that
those
dangers
must
be
considered.
if
the
government
closes
an
air
force
base
and
people
are
worried
about
unemployment,
that
is
an
anxiety.
if
the
government
raises
the
tax
rate,
people
might
go
crazy
with
worry
and
fear
as
a
result.
there
are
a
million
ways
in
which
the
government
affects
the
anxiety
level,
but
nepa
is
a
special
statute.
it
really
deals
with
only
one
form
of
threat
to
man's
welfare.
it
is
not
an
all-purpose
welfare
statute.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
believe
that
people's
anxieties
about
the
crime
rate
and
about
prison
escapes
are
not
an
environmental
impact.
that
is
our
submission.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the...
there
is
at
least
one
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
has
indicated,
at
least,
that
that
may
be.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
government
is
not
absolutely
overjoyed
by
that
proposition,
but
we
think
that
in
any
event
it
is
wholly
distinguishable
from
this
one.
there
is
a...
there
is
a
body
of
rather
intricate
law
under
nepa
that
deals
with
socioeconomic
and
other
actual
consequences
that
are
called
secondary
consequences.
even
with
respect
to
those,
your
honor,
we
would
think
that
the
statute
requires
that
that
kind
of
socioeconomic
effect
come
in
only
if
it
can
be
traced
direct
to
the
environmental
impact
of
the
government
action,
and
that
is
why
we
have
trouble
in
the
case
that
you
gave,
we
have
a
hard
time
seeing
exactly
how
it
is
that
there
has
been
an
adverse
change
in
the
natural
environment,
but
it
is,
i
suppose,
a
case
that
one
can
confound
oneself
with.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes.
the
government
concedes
that
there
are
hard
cases,
but
we
don't
think
this
is
one,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
not
unless
there
are
questions.
