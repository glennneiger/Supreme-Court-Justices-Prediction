justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
jordan,
may
i
move
away
from
crime,
back
to
nuclear
energy?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let's
assume
that
a
new
nuclear
plant
is
proposed
to
be
located
25
miles
from
three
mile
island.
what
would
your
position
be
with
respect
to
it?
or
move
it
ten,
or
move
it--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--it's
a
brand
new
plant.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
your
short
answer
is
that
you
would
oppose
the
construction
of
one
25
miles
away?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
a
limiting
principle
to
your
position?
is
it
mileage?
is
it
new
plants
versus
old
plants?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--even
apart
from
the
same
population,
mr.
jordan,
in
view
of
all
of
the
publicity
that
the
accident
had
in
three
island,
do
you
think
the
people
of
the
united
states
would
have
any
substantially
less
apprehension...
i
am
not
talking
about
all
the
people,
but
some
people...
about
a
new
plant
that
is
proposed,
or
indeed
about
existing
plants?
