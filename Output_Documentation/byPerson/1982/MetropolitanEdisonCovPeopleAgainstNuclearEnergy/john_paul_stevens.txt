mr.
bator,
can
i
ask
you
about
your
hypothetical?
it
seems
to
me
that
is
different
from
this
case,
because
there
you
are
assuming
an
environmental
impact,
namely,
the
fluoridation,
and
psychological
impairment
of
health
as
a
result
of
an
environmental
impact.
is
that
correct?
are
you
saying
that
wouldn't
be
something
you
would
look
at?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
are
arguing
that
psychological
health
is
not
health.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
are
saying
you
don't
have
to
look
at
it
even
if
it's
caused
by
a
change
in
the
environment?
that's
a
different
argument
than
your
brief
makes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
your
fluoride
case.
it
seems
to
me
that's
your
fluoride
case.
i
think
you
may
have
picked
a
bad
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
would
analogize
this,
i
guess,
to
building
a
prison.
neighbors
are
afraid
there
might
be
escapes
and
the
like,
but
that
is
not
an
environmental
hazard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
you
had...
perhaps
it
is
an
unlikely
situation...
but
a
restart
situation,
you
restart
three
mile
island,
but
assume
that
you
could
do
it
in
a
way
that
would
cause
no
effect
on
the
physical
environment.
say
you
had
no
smoke
come
out
of
the
smokestacks,
and
no...
the
water
discharge
would
be
exactly
like
everything
else.
no
physical
impact
on
the
environment.
would
you
have
a
case
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
the
government
is
arguing
no
causal
connection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
say,
well,
let's
take
it
one
step
further
and
say
no
impact
at
all
on
the
physical
environment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
get
within
the
statute
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
saying
there
are
none.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
you
have
analyzed
the...
say
you
conclude
there
is
zero
potential,
just
hypothetically.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
people
don't
believe
it,
you
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
statement
says
there
is
zero
potential.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
my...
my
hypothesis
is
that
you
don't.
that's
my
hypothesis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
mere--
