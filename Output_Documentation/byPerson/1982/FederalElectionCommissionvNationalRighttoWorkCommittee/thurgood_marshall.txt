thurgood
marshall
is
it
in
the
record
anyplace?
justice

do
you
know
of
any
other
membership
corporation

justice
thurgood
marshall
my
final
question
is
where
did
you
raise
your
constitutional
point?
when?
justice
thurgood

not
is.
when.
was
it
raised
in

--and
as
of
that,
i
haven't
found
out
yet
where
the
constitutional
part--
justice

marshall
--did
you
raise
it?
justice

it?

he'd
have
to
hold
annual
meetings
and
a
lot
of
other
meetings
you
would
have
had
to
hold.
and
elections
for
the
board
of
directors.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
way
for
us
to
rule
with
you
without
at
the
same
time
admitting
that
we
are
knowingly
ignoring
the
laws
of
the
state
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
please
tell
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
just
said
you
have
a
membership
list.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
to
use
your
phrase,
they're
second-class
members.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
second
class.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
are
not
first
class.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
are
guaranteed
by
the
laws
of
virginia;
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
your
information,
the
membership
list
of
naacp
is
controlled
by
the
state
of
new
york,
not
alabama.
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
the
same
way
there.
it
was
the
new
york
members
who--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and
it
still
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
there
wasn't,
he
could
have
gotten
the
list
in
new
york.
anybody
could
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know
more
about
it
than
i
do.
go
right
ahead.
mr.
mansfield,
if
you
prevail,
will
the
limitations
on
corporate
political
action
committees
differ
from
those
on
those
committees
that
are
set
up
by
individuals?
