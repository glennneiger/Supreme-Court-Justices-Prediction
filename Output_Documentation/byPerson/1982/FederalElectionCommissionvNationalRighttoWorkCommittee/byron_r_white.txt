justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
exception
to
that
prohibition
applies
only
if
the
solicitation
is
of
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
could
have
left
the
statute
the
way
it
was,
before
76.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
corporations
should
be
able
to
spend
some
of
its
money
for
solicitation,
subject
to
some
limitation.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
certainly
don't
need
to
get
to
the
constitutional
considerations
to
pose
the
issue
of
what
does
a
membership
mean.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
be
here
arguing
if
they
had...
i
think
you
probably
would,
but
would
you
be
here
arguing
if
the
corporation
had
said
that
anybody
who...
in
their
initial
solicitations
they
said
anybody
who
gives
us
$5.00
is
a
member.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
they,
in
their
initial
circulation,
said
anybody
who
gives
us
$5.00
is
a
member.
and
then
they
wanted
to
solicited
everybody
who
had
given
them
$5.00.
solicit
them
for
political
contributions.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
there
is
a
definite
intra-organization
definition
of
membership.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
be
here,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
they
didn't
say
that
when
they
initially
solicited
it,
but
everybody
who
gave
them
anything,
they
sent
a
membership
card
to.
so
why
not...
de
facto,
at
least,
didn't
they
have
a
policy
of
making
everybody
who
gave
them
any
money
a
member?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean?
do
you
challenge
the
fact
that
they
sent
them
a
membership
card?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
nevertheless,
they
recognized
them
as
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so.
but
they
suddenly
discovered
that
people
who
gave
them...
we
suddenly
discover
we
were
members.
so
this
is
a
policy
of
the
organization.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
they
put
a
little
footnote
to
their
initial
solicitation,
by
the
way,
anybody
who
gives
us
money
is
a
member.
just
about
eight
or
nine
words.
that
would
have
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
have
to
have
anymore
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
voluntary
acceptance
in
the
sense
that
if
you
have
that
footnote
and
the
guy
sends
in
his
money,
he
has
accepted
membership.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
suggest
that
it
was
illegal
under
state
law
for
the
corporation
to
treat
these
people
as
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
my
question.
so
i
take
it
you
say
that
they...
was
it
consistent
with
state
law
or
not,
to
treat
these
contributors
as
members?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
so
it
is
illegal
for
them
to
treat
anybody
as
a
member.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
to
my
question
is
under
the
state
law
they
were
not
permitted
to
treat
these
people
as
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
are
you
saying
you're
also
obligated
to
say
that
you
are
a
membership
organization?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
steele,
if
we
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue,
which
i
would
suppose
we
would
if
we
accept
your
definition
of
membership,
wouldn't
resolving
that
question
almost
resolve
the
constitutionality
of
the
pre-1976
situation
with
respect
to
membership
corporations?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
say...
and
then
the
question
is
well,
how
does
this
restriction
serve
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
answering
those
questions
could
easily
resolve
the
constitutionality
of
the
general
restriction
with
respect
to
membership
corporations.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that's
the
case,
then,
if
you
would
sustain
the
general
prohibition
with
respect
to
membership,
wouldn't
you
necessarily
have
to
sustain
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
certainly
have
taken
the
position
that
these
people
are
not
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
defined
it
to
that
extent.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
claim
to
know
that
these
people
are
not
members,
but
in
that
extent,
it's
defined.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
we
talk
about
whether
that's
defensible
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
might
apply
to
another
case,
but
here
the
organization
was
not
a
membership
organization.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
certainly,
one
of
the
positions
of
the
commission
is
if
you're
not
a
membership
organization
under
the
state
law,
you're
not
a
membership--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say,
i
guess,
the
first
amendment
would
limit
the
discretion
of
the
commission
to
say
what
a
membership
organization
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
only
restriction
of
the
commission
was
that
you
should
be
a
membership
organization
under
state
law,
and
if
you
aren't
you
don't
solicit
anybody--
justice
byron
r.
white
--why?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mansfield,
you
give
the
impression
that
you
have
done
almost
the
same
thing
as
if
you
had
gone
and
converted
your
virginia
charter
to
a
corporation
with
members.
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
you
have.
i
think
it's
one
thing
to
make
that
sort
of
an
offer
in
conciliation
proceedings.
perhaps
it
fleshes
out
the
position
of
the
agency.
but
i
don't
think
that
puts
you
in
the
same
position
as
if
you
had
gone
ahead
and
said
i
don't
care
what
the
fec
says;
as
a
matter
of
prudent
advice
to
my
client,
i'm
going
to
at
least
give
him
this
much
to
go
on
under
the
statutory
definition.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
also
puts
a
lot
of
restrictions
on
what
the
managers
can
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
the
case
even
if
there
were
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
it
go
to
members
or
would
it
go--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't?
that's
interesting.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
never
said
that
in
your
solicitation...
we
would
like
you
to
become
a
member.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
never
mentioned
membership.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
people
who
contribute
are
people...
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
nothing
that
defines
members
in
your
bylaws
or
in
your
articles
or
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
these
are
just
telling
us
that
that's
the
way
you
treat--
justice
byron
r.
white
--how
did
they
know
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that.
but
how
did
they
even
know
that
they
became
a
member?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
suddenly,
after
they
gave
money
they
suddenly
got
some
distributions
that
said
they
were
a
member.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
treated
them
as
a
member.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suppose
the
state,
the
attorney
general,
could
have
closed
you
down
if
he
said
i
understand
you're
sending
out
membership
cards,
and
yet
you've
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state
that
you're
not
a
membership
organization.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
take
it
the
other
way.
if
you're
going
to
call
them
members
you
have
to
treat
them
like
members,
under
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
do
you
stay
a
member
if
you've
given
$10
one
year
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--some
association
wants
to
solicit
them
for
political
contributions
two
years
later,
and
yet
there's
never
been
any
intervening
contributions.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
some
rule
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
he
gives
some
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
he
send
them
for?
do
they
send
a
bill
in
the
amount
of
his
previous
contribution?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there's
no
standard
membership
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
give
a
million
dollars
one
year,
you
get
billed
for
a
million
dollars
the
next
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
one
suggests
that
your
initial
mailing
to
the
public
is
by
any
means
violates
any
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you're
free
to
solicit
for
membership,
as
you
would
like
to
have
it
interpreted--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
public
generally.
the
restriction
would
say
that
you're
not
supposed
to
use
the
money
raised
for
that
kind
of
a
solicitation
to
finance
political
solicitations
with
such
funds--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't...
you
don't...
if
you
didn't
claim
to
be
a
membership
organization,
you
wouldn't
be
in
here
challenging
the
general
restriction
on
forming
these
groups.
