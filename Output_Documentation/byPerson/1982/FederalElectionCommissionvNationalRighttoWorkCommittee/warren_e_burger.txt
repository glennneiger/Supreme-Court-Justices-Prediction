chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
federal
election
commission
against
the
national
right
to
work
committee.
mr.
steele,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
are
1:00
o'clock.
and
would
you,
at
least
for
me,
address
the
bellotti
case
at
that
time.
mr.
steele,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mansfield.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
membership
list
maintained
somewhere
in
the
central
office?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
this
membership
list,
is
it
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
virginia
allow
or
permit
the
membership
list
to
remain
confidential?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
now,
absent
knowledge
of
membership,
are
there
some
practical
problems
lurking
here?
this
case
has
come
up
through
a
united
states
district
judge
and
then
through
seven,
eight,
or
nine
court
of
appeal
judges
and
then
here.
what
about
some
other
requirements
of
knowing
whether
judges
are
disqualified?
suppose
the
wives
of
all
those
judges
who
dealt
with
it
were
members
had
contributed
to
this
organization,
would
they
be
disqualified?
0....
in
other
words,
in
your
briefs
and
the
briefs
coming
here,
unlike
those
in
some
of
the
corporate
cases,
we
don't
have
a
list
of
members.
we
couldn't
have
with
as
many
members
as
you...
as
you
state
that
you
have.
does
that
present
a
practical
problem,
the
nondisclosure
of
members?
well,
how
are
judges
going
to
know
whether
they're
disqualified
under
other
statutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
make
it
a
little
bit
closer.
suppose
it
developed
that
all
these
judges
were
members
of
this
organization
in
the
sense
that
they
had
sent
$5
or
$10
every
year.
would
they
be
disqualified?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
steele?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
federal
election
commission
against
the
national
right
to
work
committee
will
be
announced
by
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
rehnquist.
