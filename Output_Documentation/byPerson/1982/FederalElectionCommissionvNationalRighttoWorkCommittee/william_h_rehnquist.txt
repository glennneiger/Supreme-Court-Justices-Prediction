justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
steele,
i
take
it
from
your
brief
that
it's
441b(4)(c),
is
it,
that
contains
the
exemption
that
was
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
precise
operative
language
of
441b
that
would
prevent
these
people
from
doing
what
they
seek
to
do
if
it
weren't
for
the
441b(b)(4)(c)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
which
line
or
which
clause
of
(a)
sets
forth
the
prohibition
against
what
these
people
are
trying
to
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
but
i
don't
want
to
get
to
the
example.
you
say
that
in
seeking
to
solicit
money
from
these
people
that
are
circularizing,
they
are,
what,
accepting
a
contribution
for
an
election?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
now
the
complaint
is
the
expenditure
of
this
membership
corporation
or
a
membership
corporation's
assets
to
undertake
the
solicitation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
steele,
is
this
the
precise
language
in
441b(a)
or
for
any
corporation,
whatever,
or
any
labor
organization,
to
make
a
contribution
or
expenditure
in
connection
with
any
election
at
which
a
presidential
and
vice...
and
if
not,
what
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can't
answer
that
now.
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seemed
to
me
that
441b(4)(i)
was
a
good
deal
closer
to
a
precise
proscription
than
the
more...
what
i
thought
was
the
more
general
language
in
441b(a).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
congress
intended
to
do
other
than
have
a
paraphrase
in
subsection
(4)
of
the
more
general
language
in
441b?
do
you
think
congress
meant
to
tighten
up
that
language
in
subsection
(4)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
steele,
i
wonder
how
confident
you
are
of
that
answer.
where
i
practiced...
and
i
have
understood
it's
a
fairly
general
doctrine
in
the
states...
they
have
the
doctrine
of
de
facto
corporations.
a
bona
fide
attempt
to
incorporate,
a
certain
amount
of
formalities
complied
with,
and
the
state
would
treat
you
as
a
corporation.
do
you
know
that
virginia
would
not
have
treated
these
people
as
a
corporation
on
the
basis
of
what
they
actually
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
this
court
has
sanctioned
it.
in
what
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
really
didn't
involved
federal
election
controls.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
our
organizational
standing
cases
have
frequently
dealt
with
just
groups
of
people
or
associations
that
didn't
attempt
to
have
corporate
status.
and
i
would
think
perhaps
when
you're
talking
about
a
member
of
an
organization
like
that
you
might
mean
one
thing;
when
you're
talking
about
a
member
of
a
corporation,
of
a
non-profit
corporation
with
members,
you
might
be
talking
about
something
quite
different.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can
hardly
believe
that
congress
meant
to
incorporate
the
definition
that
this
court
used
in
hunt
versus
washington
state
apple
commission
when
it
was
enacting
the
federal
campaign
contribution
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
before
they
looked
even
to
this
court's
prior
guidance
they
might
figure
out
what
they
were
incorporating
under,
under
the
laws
of
virginia,
and
if
they
get
a
status
that
says
it
has
no
members,
i
would
think
they
might
feel
they
were
in
trouble.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wait
a
minute.
isn't
congress
rather
apt,
when
it
talks
about
a
corporation
and
a
corporation
without
member...
a
not
for
profit
corporation
without
members
in
view
of
the
long
history
of
federal
refusal
to
participate
in
general
incorporation,
isn't
it
apt
to
be
referring
to
state
laws?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
client
made
that
inquiry
of
the
commission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you're
talking
as
if
we're
construing
the
assumption
on
a
kind
of
a
common
law
basis...
there's
no
substantial
reason
in
first
amendment
terms.
the
question
is
what
did
congress
mean.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
look
at...
if
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
i
suppose
you
could
look
at
the
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
and
only
that
language
to
support
it,
do
we
have
any
basis
for
speculating
as
to
why
congress
left
it
rather
open
ended?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
precisely
what
section
is
it
that
you're
contending
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
one
starts
out,
"this
paragraph
shall"
but
that's
an
exemption.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
then
the
question
is
would
congress...
if
you're
correct
that
the
(c)
perhaps
is
"under-inclusive"
or
whatever
the
lingo
is,
i
suppose
then
the
question
would
be
whether
congress
would
have
preferred
the
statute
without
any
exception
or
with
one
as
broad
as
you
propose.
and
i
suppose
with
no
exception
it
really
doesn't
help
you
much
to
say
it's
under-inclusive.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
for
more
than
75
years,
congress
has
tried
to
prevent
corruption
in
federal
election
by
passing
laws
limiting
the
ways
that
corporations
and
labor
unions
can
spend
money
in
those
elections.
in
this
case,
we
are
asked
to
decide
whether
these
election
laws
were
violated
by
a
nonprofit
corporation
that
solicited
political
contributions
from
about
270,000
people.
when
all
the
various
provisions
and
exceptions
of
the
federal
election
laws
are
followed
through,
it
turns
out
that
nonprofit
corporations
can
solicit
political
contributions
but
only
from
members
of
the
corporation.
we
decide
in
this
case
that
the
corporation
involved
here,
the
national
right
to
work
committee
has
violated
these
laws
by
soliciting
contributions
from
people
who
were
not
its
members.
the
company
had
said
in
its
corporate
charter
that
it
had
no
members
at
all.
it
never
held
membership
meetings
and
the
people
it
solicited
didn't
take
part
in
the
operations
of
the
company.
we
conclude
that
congress
required
a
closer
connection
than
this
for
someone
to
qualify
as
a
member
of
the
corporation.
the
company
also
argued
that
congress
violated
the
first
amendment
when
it
forbad
nonprofit
corporations
from
soliciting
nonmembers
since
this
prevented
it
from
associating
members
of
the
public.
while
the
constitution
protects
the
freedom
to
associate,
our
past
decisions
have
also
held
that
congress
may
restrict
this
freedom
in
certain
ways
providing
that
those
ways
have
a
reasonable
justification
for
doing
that.
in
this
case,
a
completely
adequate
justification
is
provided
by
the
need
to
prevent
the
political
corruption
that
might
result
from
use
of
financial
resources
of
corporations
and
labor
unions
in
the
election
process.
because
of
our
view
of
the
meaning
congress'
membership
requirement,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
which
it
decided
that
congress
intended
a
much
broader
definition
of
the
term.
