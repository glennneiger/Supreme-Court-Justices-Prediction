mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
whole
fec
argument
in
this
case
is
based
upon
one
premise
and
one
assumption,
an
assumption
which
only
this
court
now
at
this
stage
has
realized
and
made
the
fec
answer,
and
that
is:
almost
every
argument
that
it
makes
states
that
the
individuals
that
the
national
right
to
work
committee
solicited
in
1976
for
contributions
to
its
pac
were
not
its
members.
never
has
the
fec
looked
into
and
defined
what
a
member
is
for
the
terms
of
the
act.
the
act
itself,
the
statute
itself
and
the
regulations
promulgated
under
the
statute--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--they
do.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
only
to
the
extent
where
on
the
public
record
the
federal
election
commission
has
stated
it
knows
what
a
membership
corporation
is.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
to
that
extent
it
is
defined.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
well,
it
is
not
defensible
for
numerous
reasons.
the
first
of
which
is
that
the
statute,
on
its
face,
allows
corporations
without
capital
stock...
not
membership
organization,
but
capital
organizations
without
capital
stock...
to
solicit
its
members.
the
regulation
promulgated
by
the
federal
election
commission
seems
to
adopt
the
definition
of
a
member
of
the
organization
itself,
except
that
it
does
not
allow
the
membership
to
be
premised
solely
upon
contribution
to
the
separate,
segregated
fund.
never
has
the
fec
been
able
to
precisely
define
what
a
member
is.
however,
this
court
has
sanctioned
the
use
of
an
analysis
between
or
of
the
relationship
between,
or
nexus
between,
the
organization
and
the
participant
in
determining
membership
status.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--that's
in
the
hunt
versus
washington
state
apple
advertising
commission
case.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
not
at
all.
that
case
was
a
case
in
which
the
court
was
asked
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
washington
state
commission
had
standing
before
a
federal
court
to
prosecute
the
claims
of
its
members
against
another
state,
and
this
court
said
that
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
was
a
traditional
membership
organization,
whether
it
was
the
type
of
organization
which
the
prior
cases
had
allowed
standing,
that
the
court
would
look
below
the
organizing
documents,
below
the
fact
that
this
was
a
state
organization
and
look
into
the
nexus
between
the
individuals
and
the--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--i
believe
that
the
analysis
holds,
though.
the
analysis
that
this
court
has
sanctioned,
looking
beyond
the
formal
organization
into
the
nexus.
i
mean
after
all,
the
question
here
is
what
did
the
statute
mean,
what
does
the
federal
election
campaign
act
mean
when
it
says
corporations
without
capital
stock
can
solicit
their
members.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
not
at
all,
but
the
question
faced
by
those
individuals
such
as
the
national
right
to
work
committee
when
they
are
faced
with
how
do
they
comply
with
the
statute
is
when
they're
deciding
what
is
a
member.
they
have
to
look
to
this
court's
prior
guidance
as
to--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--well,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
is
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
the
state
definition
of
member
is
not
likely
to
reflect
the
first
amendment
rights
that
are
involved
in
an
interpretation
of
the
federal
election
campaign
act.
for
example,--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--not
in
this
case,
and
i
would
say
not
in
this
case
because
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
federal
election
commission
in
interpreting
the
act,
some
months
after
they
filed
the
complaint
against
the
national
right
to
work
committee,
the
question
was
posed
to
the
federal
election
commission:
is
it,
in
your
opinion,
federal
election
commission,
necessary
only
for
us
to
become...
to
change
our
articles,
to
amend
our
articles
of
incorporation
and
become
a
membership
organization?
the
question
was
posed.
and
the
answer
was,
we
don't
know.
it
is
not
enough
for
you
to
change
your
membership,
change
your
articles,
and
become
a
membership
organization.
that
is
not
what
congress
meant.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
yes.
and
the
commission,
as
the
court
of
appeals
stated,
barricaded
itself
behind
that
articles
of
incorporation.
the
offer
was
made,
and
the
fec
says
that's
not
enough.
so
we
don't
know...
at
least,
according
to
the
fec--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--it
is,
for
the
purposes
of
state
law,
it
is
a
corporation
without
members.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
undoubtedly,
it
is
a
membership
corporation.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
there
is
a
membership
list.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
it
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
there
are
not
regular
meetings
of
the
membership.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
that's
the
issue
in
the
case
with
respect
to
the
organization
documents,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
the
constitutional
point
in
this
case
is
that
the
fec,
the
statute--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--this
case
came
up
through
the
courts
as
follows.
the
national
right
to
work
committee
filed
an
action
against
the
federal
election
commission;
some
months
later,
the
fec
filed
an
action
against
the
national
right
to
work
committee.
the
cases
were
consolidated
and
came
up
through
the
courts
of
appeals
that
way.
at
the
original--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--at
the
district
court.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
we
raised
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
it
is
in
the
complaint,
in
the
original--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--to
just
finish
my
answer
with
respect
to
the
organization
documents,
the
fec,
the
federal
election
commission's
interpretation
of
congressional
intent
is
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
you're
a
membership
organization
under
state
law,
that's
enough.
our
position
in
this
case
is
that--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--it
was
not
a
membership
organization.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
but
there's
never
been
a
substantial
reason
in
first
amendment
terms
why
an
organization
must
have
this
threshold
criteria.
there's
never
been
a--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--congress...
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
at
all,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
dealt
with
the
question
of
what
is
a
member.
it's
clear--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--indeed.
and
the
statute
says
membership
organizations,
some
other
organizations,
and
corporations
without
capital
stock
can
solicit
their
members.
the
statute
doesn't
say
membership
corporations.
or
corporations
with
members.
the
congress
left
it,
we
believe,
purposefully
vague
in
order
to
get
all
of
the
efficacy
organizations
such
as
the
national
right
to
work
committee,
regardless
of
whether
organizationally
they
had
members
or
not.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
we
have
nothing
from
the
record
as
to
speculation.
however,--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--yes.
if
the
commission's
position
is
correct,
and
if
the
prohibition
on
membership,
the
strict
restrictions
on
membership
of
the
commission
are
adopted,
then
one
must
say
that
it's
clear
that
these
restrictions
infringe
upon
the
rights
of
the
association,
the
rights
of
the
members
of
the
national
right
to
work
committee.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
if
that
were
the
case,
then
this
case
never
would
have
been
before
this
court.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
because
long
ago
at
the
conciliation
period,
the
national
right
to
work
committee
offered
to
amend
its
articles
of
incorporation,
and
this
was
refused.
the
federal
election
commission
said
that's
not...
whatever
the
nexus
is
between
individuals
and
an
organization
to
make
them
members,
that
is
not
it.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
that's
true.
but
there
are
reasons...
the
reason
why
the
committee,
i
presume,
was
not,
at
that
time,
i
presume,
organized
as
a
membership
organization
under
virginia
articles
of
incorporation
is
because
it's
an
advocacy
organization.
it's
not
a
trade
association,
it's
not
a
professional
association--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--absolutely.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
right.
but
it's
an
advocacy
organization.
it's
an
organization
by
its
charter
organized
and
operated
for
one
purposes,
and
only
one
purpose.
unlike
the
trade
and
professional
associations,
it
provides
no
services
to
its
members,
it
has
no
conventions.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
it
is
a
section
501(c)(4)
organization.
the
assets
would
be
given
to
an
organization
that
carries
on
similar
purposes.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
and
if
there
were
members,
i
suppose
it
would--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--it
would
not
go
to
members;
it
would
go
to
the
same
sort
of
organization.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
of
course,
we
don't
hold
that
it
is
not
our
position--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--it
is
not
our
position
that
the
statute
itself
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
not
the
general
prohibition.
we're
saying
that
what
we
are
attacking
is
441b(b)(4)(c),
and
we're
not
attacking
the
statute
nor
the
regulation,
unless
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
election
commission--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--to
the
extent
that
it
infringes
upon
the
rights
of
the
members
of
the
national
right
to
work
committee
to
associate
through
political
contributions
in
the
political
sphere,
that
is
true.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
section
441b(b)(4)(c)
is
the
section
that's--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--yes,
that's
an
exemption.
but
to
the
extent
that
it
differentiates,
if
it
cuts
off
the
associational
rights
of
the
members
of
the
national
right
to
work
committee,
then
the
statute
doesn't
reflect
the...
certainly
doesn't
reflect
the
congressional
intent.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
no...
if
there
were
no
exceptions,
we
would
be
in
the
same
position
as
everyone
else.
our
rights
would
not
be
infringed
upon
differently.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
that's
a
very
good
question
because
the
federal
election
commission
in
its
brief
failed
to
distinguish
between
two
types
of
solicitations.
the
national
right
to
work
committee
finds
its
members
through
mass
solicitation.
it
rents
lists
or
does
whatever
it
needs
to
get
at
individuals,
to
find
the
names
of
individuals
it
believes...
that
believe
in
its
philosophy
and
who
are
willing
to
take
an
active
part
in
promulgating
its
philosophy.
to
the
extent
that
in
1976...
actually,
the
figures
in
the
record
are
from
1977
i
believe...
at
least
eight
million
solicitation
letters
were
sent.
however,
these
were
solicitations
not
for
political
candidates,
but
rather,
for
membership.
the
national
right
to
work
committee
was
looking
for
members.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
the
solicitations
are
as
follows.
generally
speaking,
in
their--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--they
all
speak
of
joining
with.
they
ask
whether
or
not
the
individual
believes
in
the
philosophy
of
the
organization,
and
it's
not
an
ask;
it's
you
check
the
blank.
and
second,
it
says,
please
join
with
us.
so
these
are
individuals
who...
the
members
are
individuals
that
have
agreed
with
and
joined
with--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--well,
the
people
who
contributed
are
additionally,
active
members.
there
are
two
types
of
members
in
the
organization.
and
only
the
active
members
are
the
ones
who
were
solicited
under
section
441b.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
nothing
in
the
bylaws.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
the
individuals
refer
to
themselves
as
members.
in
fact,
11
depositions
were
taken
at
the
district
court
stage
in
this
case.
all
of
the
11
were
members
who
had
contributed
to
the
solicitation
for
the
ercc.
of
those
11,
all
but
3
knew
that...
all
of
them
knew
what
the
philosophy
of
the
national
right
to
work
committee
was,
and
believed
in
it.
all
but
3,
3
out
of
11,
believed
they
were
members,
knew
they
were
members.
they
were
unequivocal
that
they
were
members.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
they
knew
that
because
the
rights
and
obligations,
as
mr.
steele
calls
them,
of
the
committee...
once
you
become
a
member,
the
committee
sends
you
regularly
and
routinely
information.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
they
knew
because
the
solicitation...
the
membership
solicitation.
they
sent
the
thing
back.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
yes,
they
got
a
membership
card.
all
active
members
who
are
really
at
issue
here
have
membership
cards.
they
received
a
membership
card.
they
sent
something
back,
they
sent
their
questionnaire
back,
they
said
i
want
to
join,
i
want
to
help
you;
they
got
a
membership
card.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
for
the
purposes
of
state
law,
members,
under
the
statute,
have
certain
rights.
if
you're
going
to
give
people
that
right,
then
you
have
to
call
them
members.
for
example,
voting.
if
you
want
people
to
vote,--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--under
state
law,
if
you
call
them
in
your
charter.
the
reason
that
the
committee
does
not
have
members,
or
at
least
didn't
at
that
time,
is
because
it's
an
advocacy
organization.
and
the
key
to
an
advocacy
organization
is
the
efficient
use
of
contributed
funds.
the
national
right
to
work
committee
has
one
goal,
and
its
goal
is
to
educate
the
public
and
advocate
voluntary
unionism.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
the
national
right
to
work
committee
has,
the
committee
itself
has,
both
corporate
and
noncorporate
members.
as
to
how
much
of
the
dues
are
contributed
by
either,
it's
not
on
the
record.
i
don't
know.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
there
is
a
membership
list
maintained
because
the
committee
actively
and
constantly
communicates
with
its
members
by
mail.
there's
quite
a...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
1.25
million
members.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
you
get
your
member--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--on
the
factual--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--yes,
there
is,
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
the
records.
an
active
member,
when
one
joins
the
organization,
he
is...
he
becomes
an
active
member.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
when
he
gives
some
money.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
he
becomes
an
active
member.
he
gets
his
active
membership
card
back.
he
knows
he's
an
active
member.
one
year
later
he's
sent
a
dues
bill
because
the
organization
calls
these
voluntary
dues,
and
he's
sent
a
bill.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
yes.
now
these--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--there
is
no
standard
membership
fee.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
well,
whatever
you
can
afford,
because--
[laughter]
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
yes,
there
is.
the...
the
laws
of--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--the
laws
of
the
state
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
deal
only
with
the
rights
of
the
members,
if
they
are
members,
or
the
individuals
of
the
organization.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
we
have
a
membership
list
but
they
don't
accord
these
individuals
the
rights
that
they
would
be
accorded
under
the
law
of
virginia
if
they
were
to
lose
accorded--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--we
have
members
who
are--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--they
are
not
second
class.
we--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--we
would
like
to...
we
would
like
to
believe
that
they're
all
first-class
members.
the
only
rights
of
membership
that
they
don't
have
are
the
rights
to
vote
and--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--only
if
you
declare
yourself
as
a
membership
organization.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
no.
as
an
advocacy
organization,
the
national
right--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--yes.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
he
has
the
right
to
receive
the
materials
and
he's
asked
to...
to
take
the
action
in
support
of
the
philosophy.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
well--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--in
1976
the
case
arose
by
the
fact
that
the
national
right
to
work
committee
made
solicitations.
in
the
face
of
an
unknown
law,
it
chose
only
to
solicit
active
members
who
had...
who
had
contributed
that
year.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
well,
depending
upon
the--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--it
is
our
position
that
all
members
of
the
organization,
of
the
committee,
are
members.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
and
have
an
equal--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--right.
right.
because
they've
joined
the
organization,
they've
joined
the
organization
affirmatively
to--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--they
believe
in
the
philosophy
and
they've
taken
an
affirmative
step
to
further
that
philosophy.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
the
issue--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--we
would
like
this
court
to
decide
on
the
broad
basis.
however,
it's
possible
for
the...
for
us
to
win
the
case
if
this
court
held
that
one
of
the
parts
of
the
nexus
between
an
individual
and
the
organization
in
order
to
be
a
member
must
be
some
financial
contribution.
we
don't
believe--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--excuse
me?
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
no,
we
don't
have
to
write...
rewrite
any...
either
one,
because
the
statute
simply
says,
membership...
membership--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--in
the
organization--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--yes.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
well,
all
of
the
members
of
the
national
right
to
work
committee
are
members
for
that--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--for
that.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
the
membership
list
is
not
in
the
record.
the
membership
list
has
always
been
kept
confidential
by
the
organization
as...
on...
as
the
membership
list
in
the
naacp
v.
alabama
was
kept
confidential
because
it
is
an
advocacy
organization.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
it...
it
does
unless
the
membership,
unless
it
is
a
membership
organization,
at
which
time
individuals
would
have...
members
might
have
the
right
to
view
the
membership
list.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
in
naacp
v.
alabama,
however--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--yes,
sir,
but
the
state--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--the
state
tried
to
get
those
members
made
as
a
condition
precedent
for
the--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--yes.
but
this
court
held
that
the
state
couldn't
compel
that
membership
list--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--no.
actually,
there
are
the
three
different
types.
the
fec
refers
to
the
cma
case,
the
california
medical
association
case,
which
is
an
independent
multi-candidate
political
committee.
it...
that
case,
in
that
case
they
registered
as
such,
and
then
came
to
this
court
asking
for
more
rights.
but
what
they
did
is
they
registered
as
such.
that,
in
a
case
like
that,
they
can
solicit
the
whole
general
public,
but
no
individuals,
no
unassociated
corporation,
for
example,
can
give
more
than
$5,000
towards
those
solicitations.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
it
doesn't--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--it
does
not.
under
441(b)
corporations,
including
corporations
without
capital
stock,
can
in
essence
underwrite
the
solicitation
expenses,
but
as
a
trade-off,
instead
of
being
able
to
solicit
the
general
public,
they
can
only
solicit
certain
defined--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--we
would
hope
that
this
court
would
not
have
to
go
that
far
to
find
that.
but
i
believe
that
the
court
has
held
in
the
california
medical
association
that
congress
had
the
right
to...
to
look
at
the...
the...
the
threat;
the
threat
being
that
the
corporate
warchest,
for
example,
the
ability
of
a
corporation
to
use
its
general
treasury
funds.
if
a
corporation
could
use
the
general
treasury
funds
to
solicit
the
world,
then
the
congress
felt
there
is
a
balancing
that
this
would
be
unfair.
so
it
instead
says
it
can
use
corporate
funds
but
only
to
solicit
its
members
or
people
with
a
nexus
between
the
organization,
the
corporation.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
i
am
sorry,
i
couldn't
hear
the
first
part.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
not
directly.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
with
the
exception
that
you
can
use...
you
can
use
that
money
to...
to
finance
political
solicitation
only
if
that
solicitation
goes
to
your
members.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
and,
of
course,
it's
our
position
that
these
individuals
is
a
more
than
sufficient
nexus
between
these
individuals
to
be
our
members.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
no,
because
we
would
then
be
in
the
same
position,
i
suppose,
as
the
california
medical
association
was.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
well,
because
this
is
an
advocacy
organization,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
not
an
economic
organization.
the...
the
key
to
the
national
right
to
work
committee
is
people
who
join
it
wish
to
contribute
in
order
to
promote
a
philosophy.
it
would
be
the
same,
for
example,
i
suppose
as
a
church
or
any
other
type
of--
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
--only
if
they
believed...
since
it's
not
an
economic
relationship,
it's
a
philosophic
relationship,
i
would
believe
that
they
would
not
be
disqualified
unless
they
believed
that
it
would
somehow
prevent
them
from
reaching
an
equitable
decision
under
the
law.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
mansfield,
iii
i
hadn't
thought
of
it
in
those
terms
precisely,
but
i
suppose
that
there
is
justification
in
that.
