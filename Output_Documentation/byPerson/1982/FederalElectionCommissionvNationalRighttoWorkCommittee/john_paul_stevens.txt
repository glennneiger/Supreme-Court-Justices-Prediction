justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
what
would
happen
with
the
assets
of
the
entity
if
it
were
to
dissolve
and
liquidate?
who
would
get
the
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
provision
for
distributing
among
the
directors
or
anything
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
they
have
any
rights
at
all?
what
right
does
a
member
have?
to
give
money.
[laughter]
the
right
to
give
money.
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
am
serious
in
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
a
member
of
your
organization,
either
supporting
or
active,
have
any
rights
at
all
by
virtue
of
his
membership?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
true
of
both
the
supporting
and
the
active
members;
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
that
you
say
that
only...
the
only
issue
before
us
is
the
active
members?
it
seems
to
me
you
have
an
equally
strong
case
for
both--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--under
the
regulation
and
under
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
are
right
in
your
position,
you
would
also
have
the
right
to
solicit
the
others,
too;
wouldn't
you?
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they're
all
members,
under
your
definition
of
membership.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
have
an
equal
right
under
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
be
solicited?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the
issue
before
us
applies
equally
to
the
supporting
members
and
the
active
members--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
mean
the
legal
ramifications
of
what
we
are
asked
to
decide
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
to
rewrite
the
regulation
or
the
statute
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
to
rewrite
the
regulation
or
the
statute
to
draw
that
distinction,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
and
the
regulation
says,
people
who
currently
satisfy
the
requirements
of
membership
of
the
organization.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they're
all
required
to
satisfy
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they're
all
members.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
isn't
it
even
a
little
harder
than
that?
am
i
not
correct
in
understanding
that
the
rights
that
you
seek
to
vindicate
in
this
litigation
are
the
rights
of
your
members,
the
rights
to
receive
and
to
participate
in
the
political
process
in
the
manner
that
you
support?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
would
it
not
be
true
that
any
individual,
such
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
who
without
perhaps
realizing
it
is
a
member
under
your
definition,
he
is
in
effect
a
party
to
this
litigation?
or
at
least
he
would
appear
to
some
people
to
have
some
interest.
the
perception
is
the
important
thing
under
the
statute.
it
is
sort
of
a
class
action,
in
a
way.
