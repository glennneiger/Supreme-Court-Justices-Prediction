mr.
charles
n.
steele
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
scope
and
effect
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute
which
regulates
the
participation
of
corporations
and
labor
organizations
in
the
financing
of
federal
election
campaigns.
the
case
was
brought
by
the
federal
election
commission
against
the
national
right
to
work
corporation
saying
that
it
had
violated
the
prohibitions
on
the
use
of
general
corporate
treasury
funds.
the
facts
are
largely
uncontested.
they
were
found
by
the
district
court
below;
none
of
them
were
reversed
as
erroneous
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court
found
that
the...
under
virginia
law,
corporations
are
offered
a
choice
as
to
whether
they
wish
to
become
membership
corporations
or
non-membership
corporations.
virginia
law
specifically
provides
that
the
articles
of
incorporation
must
set
forth
that
fact,
whether
you
are
a
member...
if
you
are
a
non-membership
organization
it
sets
that
forth,
and
if
you
are
a
membership
organization
that
you're
not.
the
national
right
to
work
committee
organized
itself
under
these
laws,
set
itself
forth
in
its
charter
and
in
its
bylaws
and
in
its
formal
papers
as
being
an
organization
that
had
no
members.
it's
not
a
membership
organization.
the
corporation
was
also
organized
under
501(c)(4)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
as
an
educational
organization
involved
in
combatting
what
it
refers
to
compulsory
unionism.
the
district
court
also
found
that
with
regard
to
this
organization
that
its
basic
method
of
receiving
funds
was
to
rent
mailing
lists,
obtain
mailing
lists.
from
these
mailing
lists
they
would
send
out
large
mailings.
these
mailings
included
several
items.
the
first
item
would
be
an
article
about
compulsory
unionism
and
the
viewpoints
on
it.
included
therein
was...
again,
the
record
is
full
of
examples
of
these,
and
in
summarizing
them,
there
are
some
differences.
but
the
basic
format
was
that
there
would
be
an
article
on
the
effects
of
unionism,
compulsory
unionism,
frequently
reprinted
from
a
magazine.
with
it
would
be
a
questionnaire
asking
questions
of
the
people
to
whom
these
mailings
went
as
to
whether
they
agreed
with
various
questions
about
the
effect
of
these
laws,
various
right
to
work
laws,
of
various
labor
laws
that
were
pending
in
front
of
the
congress,
and
there
would
be
a
request
or
a
donation,
or
sometimes
called
a
gift
or
a
contribution
to
support
the
mailing
out
of
these
materials,
to
support
in
the
fight
against
these
particular
bills,
and
would
seek
funds.
also,
frequently
there
would
be
a
request
to
engage
in
what
is
called
legislative
action
in
the
record.
legislative
action
is
taken
as
a
term
defined
therein
to
send
in
comments
to
legislators,
and
there
would
often
be
appeals
for
that
kind
of
mailings
to
legislators.
there
was
no...
as
the
district
court
found,
there
was
no
reference
in
any
of
these
materials
to
membership
in
the
organization,
no
setting
forth
of
any
requirements
for
membership,
no
invitation
to
join
in
membership;
solely,
the
request
for
funds.
there
were
also
several
other
factors
that
the
district
court
looked
at.
it
looked
at
the
fact
that
there
was
nothing
set
forth
as
to
how
these
people
would
terminate
their
so-called
membership.
in
this
case,
the
court
set
forth
the
determination
was
something
that
was
solely
determined
by
the
national
right
to
work
committee.
the
court
of
appeals
disturbed
none
of
these
findings.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
and
what
the
commission
believes
to
be
a
very
important
statutory
issue
was
based
on
the
findings,
but
went
to
the
scope
and
effect
of
the
basic
prohibitions.
and
that
scope
and
effect
involve
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
it's
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals,
in
its
interpretation,
felt
that
interpretation
was
illuminated
certainly
by
constitutional
considerations,
which
it
certainly
is,
but
basically
was
a
question
of
the
scope
of
the
statutory
history.
to
review
that
statutory
history,
i
would
note
first
that
under
the
federal
election
campaign
act
there
are
two
forms,
two
basic
provisions.
one,
provision
441b,
which
was
the
former
u.s.
610,
governs
corporations
and
labor
organizations.
there
are
other
general
provisions
first
enacted
in
1971
governing
political
committees
as
a
whole
and
their
operation.
and
as
we
have
noted
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
this
structure
was
reviewed
by
this
court
in
the
california
medical
association
case
two
terms
ago,
and
that
basically,
what
was
set
forth
there
is
that
congress,
in
attempting
to
legislate
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
the
effect
on
the
electoral
process,
is
entitled
to
make
certain
kinds
of
judgments.
the
basic
judgment
that
congress
made
long,
long
ago
was
that
corporations...
and
then
in
1947
labor
organizations...
presented
a
different
case;
a
special
case,
a
greater
danger
to
the
electoral
process.
consequently,
the
initial
actions
of
the
congress
in
1907
were
to
ban
totally
contributions
by
corporations.
through
a
process
which
i
know
this
court
is
familiar
with
and
which,
as
a
matter
of
history,
would
take
me
a
long
time
to
recite,
there
was
an
expansion
of
that.
in
1947
congress,
feeling
that
the
definition
of
contributions
had
allowed
certain
expenditures
to
be
made
which
were,
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
same
as
contributions,
broadened
the
definition
to
include
expenditures.
but
basically,
corporations
and
labor
organizations
were
regulated
by
a
statute
which
prohibited
them
generally
from
making
expenditures
that
would
reach
outside
of
them,
to
affect
the
general
public,
to
affect
the
general
electorals,
but
were...
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
congress
in
amending
the
statute...
were
permitted
to
make
expenditures
for
communications
to
their
members.
and
most
prominently,
first
by
interpretation
of
this
court
and
then
effectively
enacted
in
1971
by
the
congress,
were
allowed
to
establish,
maintain
and
pay
for
the
solicitations
to
a
separate
segregated
fund,
and
those
solicitations
were
limited
to
its
members.
in
effect,
what
the
statute
controls
is
the
use
of
the
corporation's
funds
or
the
labor
organization's
funds.
finally,
in
1976,
in
relation
to
this
case,
there
was
an
amendment
known
as
the
allen
amendment.
when
the
congress
convened
to
act
on
the
statute
after
this
court's
decision
in
buckley
versus
valeo,
it
inserted
several
provisions
with
regard
to
then
610.
as
this
court
probably
knows,
it
moved
it
from
the
criminal
sections
of
18
usc
to
the
title
ii
and
turned
it
to
a
civil
statute.
but
with
regard
to
this
case,
they
enacted
a
provision
which
said
that
for
a
membership
corporation,
the
statute
if
read
to
bar
it
from
soliciting
its
members
would
prohibit
it
from
dealing
with
those
people
who
basically
make
up
the
corporation.
consequently,
senator
allen
proposed
and
senator
cannon,
who
was
managing
the
bill
on
behalf
of
the
proponents
of
the
bill,
agreed
that
amendment
really
corrected
a
basic
deficiency
in
the
statute.
i
don't
know
if
deficiency
is
too
strong
a
word,
but
basically,
without
that
amendment,
it
was
a
clarifying
amendment
to
make
it
clear
that
for
those
people
who
were
the
members
of
the
corporation,
that
they
would
be
allowed
to
do
the
same
solicitation
as
they
would
to
shareholders.
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
of
that
shows
that
the
purpose
of
congress
there
was
to
deal
with
members
for
a
membership
corporation
in
much
the
same
way
that
it
had
dealt
with
shareholders
for
a
stock
corporation
or
for
members
in
unions,
as
the
specialized
case
of
membership
organizations
that
the
congress
has
legislated
specially
for
them.
senator
allen,
who
was
the
proponent,
spoke
of
it
in
those
terms;
spoke
of
it
as
supplying
a
deficiency,
as
remedying
an
omission
in
the
bill
that
would
otherwise
not
make
it
clear.
the
question,
then,
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
the
district
court
and
the
commission,
was
the
interpretation
of
that
term,
of
the
membership
organization
which
is
incorporated.
it
said
that
the
scope
and
effect
of
that
must
be
to
allow
a
corporation
to
solicit
anyone
who
has
expressed
through
various
means
a
political
affinity
with
the
goals
of
the
organization.
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
rested
on
the
feeling
that
there
would
be
interference
with
associational
rights
if
such
solicitations
were
not
allowed.
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief,
we
consider
that
the
focus
of
the
statute
is
not
on
the
solicitation
but
is
on
the
flow
of
corporation
money.
the
national
right
to
work
committee
here,
having
established
a
separate,
segregated
fund,
is
permitted
under
the
statute
to
pay
for
all
of
the
costs
involved
in
that
fund.
those
involve
all
of
the
costs
of
establishing
and
maintaining,
setting
it
up,
incorporating
if
it
is
incorporated.
if
it's
not,
the
articles
for
it.
all
of
those
matters.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes,
it
is.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
again,
the
structure
of
the
statute
is
that
441b,
the
prohibition
is
contained
in
441b(a).
when
you
said
the
citation
you
said
b...
there's
a
double
b
there.
it's
441b(b)(4)(c).
the
prohibition
is
set
forth
in
441b(a).
mr.
charles
n.
steele
the
prohibition
is
that
of
making
a
contribution
or
expenditure
in
connection
with
any
federal
election.
that
has
been...
within
the
provisions
of
b(b),
what
has
been
exempted
from
that
broad
original
provision--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--the
corporation
is
making
an
expenditure;
it
is
expending
the
corporate
funds
for
the
purpose
of
the
solicitation.
in
other
words,
that
the
prohibition
is
against
using
that
money,
that
corporate
treasury
money,
to
make
an
expenditure
to
go
forth
and
seek
contributions
which
would
come
directly
to
the
corporation.
it
can
set
up
a
political
fund
which
can
do
that,
but--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--the
solicitation
is
permitted
in
the
exceptions
if
it
is
two
member,
so
the
question
revolves
around
the
question
of
whether
they
are
members
or
not.
but
yes,
that
is...
the
prohibition
is
against
the
expenditure
by
a
corporation
of
funds
to
solicit
the
general
public,
in
effect.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes.
so
that
the
critical
question
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
was
what
is
the
definition
of
members
as
intended
by
congress.
and
what
purpose
does
that
serve.
they
felt
that
there
was
no
valid
purpose
there.
again,
the
underlying
purpose
served
by
that
is
the
use
of
the
corporation's
funds
for
large-scale
use
in
federal
elections.
the
structure
has
been
designed
in
that
fashion.
i
would
note,
as
i
started
to,
that
there
is
a
separate
regulatory
scheme
for
political
committees
overall,
which
this
court
considered
in
the
california
medical
association
case,
which
limits
anyone
else
to
a
contribution
stated
in
dollar
terms
of
$5000
to
a
political
action
committee.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
that
is
the
operative
language.
as
i
say,
that
operative
language
was
clearly
interpreted
throughout
the
history
of
the
statute
as
prohibiting
the
expenditures
out
to
the
general
public.
in
the
cio
case,
this
court
was
faced
with
the
question
of
whether
that
statute
could
be
read
or
should
be
read
to
prohibit
expenditures
that
were
made
for
the
purpose
of
communicating
with,
in
that
case,
the
members
of
a
labor
organization,
but
by
parallel,
with
the
stockholders
of
a
stock
corporation.
so
that
phrase,
by
that
interpretation
and
by
this
court's
interpretation
also
in
pipefitters,
is
clearly
meant
not
to
allow
a
corporation
to
make
those
kind
of
expenditures
out
to
the
general
public;
to
solicit
broadly
for
purposes
either
to
get
in
funds
to
give
to
candidates,
or
to
make
expenditures
that
would
tout
them
on
radio
or
whatever.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that
could
be
done.
i
think
the
question
would
be
somewhat...
is
that
less
restrictive
or
more
restrictive,
because
if
you
had
a
dollar
amount
that
might
not
reflect
the
size
of
the
corporation.
so
i
think
that
congress,
in
dealing
with
that
question,
dealt
with
it
in
somewhat
different
terms,
but
basically
dealt
specifically
with
the
expenditures
by
the
corporation
for
those
kinds
of
expenses.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
they
could
have.
before
76,...
i
mean,
in
76
what
they
felt
was...
at
least
with
regard--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--but
that
solicitation
was
only
for
its--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--its
shareholders.
i
agree
congress
could
have
left
the
statute
as
it
was.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
if
i
might
pick
up
where
i
left
off
before
the
lunch
break
and
take
advantage
of
the
chief
justice's
invitation
to
discuss
the
bellotti
case,
i
would
like
to
note
first
that
what
is
here
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
not
challenged
the
basic
prohibition
of
441b
on
corporate
expenditures.
the
national
right
to
work
committee,
as
a
corporation,
admits
and
agrees
that
it
comes
under
that
provision
and
indeed,
takes
the
benefits
of
that
provision,
the
ability
under
that
provision
to
provide
for
the
support
of
a
committee.
they
do
not
challenge
the
overall
prohibition.
what
they
challenge
is
the
interpretation
of
the
subsection.
i
might...
i'm
not
sure,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
whether
my
response
to
you
was
as
helpful
as
it
might
have
been
in
discussing--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--well,
in
discussing
the
prohibitions
of
the
statute,
i
alluded
to
the
overall
provision
in
441b(a).
in
441b(4),
it
starts
off
with
repeating
the
basic
prohibition
which
is
at
issue
here
in
the
subsection.
that's
at
page
59a
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
but
4(a)
says
except
as
provided
in
subparagraphs
b,
c
and
d,
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
a
corporation,
or
its
separate,
segregated
fund,
to
spend
monies
to
solicit
contributions
to
people
other
than
stockholders'
employees.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that's
correct,
and
that
is
really
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
that's
why
i
think
by
dwelling
only
on
the
broad
prohibition.
you
have
here
the
specific
prohibition
on
a
corporation
or
its
separate,
segregated
fund,
from
soliciting
contributions
to
such
a
fund
from
persons
other
than.
(c)
is
the
one
that
is
specifically
at
issue
here,
because
it
says
except
for
b,
c
and
d...
and
c
is
the
one
that
goes
to
membership--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
think
not.
i
think
that
what
they
did
in
1976
was
to
expand
on
the
class
of
people
that
could
be
solicited,
but
the
language
in
(4)
was
itself
just
spelling
out
rather
than
changing
anything.
in
other
words,
what
they
spelled
out
was
what
the
exceptions
to
the
broad
prohibition
were.
and
as
justice
white
said,
i
think
in
1976,
what
they
did
was
to
expand
the
class
for
a
new...
for
membership
corporations
to
allow
them
to
solicit
members.
but
the
prohibition
i
think
was
basically
the
same
as
it
had
been
prior
to
that.
in
any
event,
with
regard
to
the
bellotti
case,
i
think
that
there
are
several
distinctions.
i
think,
as
i
started
to
say,
most
notably
not
challenged
here
is
the
overall
prohibition.
they
agree
that
they
come
under
the
prohibition.
and
in
effect,
this
is
almost
a
case
that
is
like
a
mirror
image
of
the
california
medical
association
case
where
they
asserted
the
right
to
solicit
throughout,
broadly
through
the
general
public;
also
asserted
the
right
that
a
political
committee
would
have
to
give
to
many
political
committees.
but
argued
to
this
court
that
they
should
also
be
allowed
to
take
advantage
of
the
provisions
in
441b
which
allow
for
administrative
support.
this
is
somewhat
the
mirror
image.
this
is
a
case
in
which
they
are
arguing
that
they
should
be
allowed
the
restriction,
which
is
the
restriction
to
the
class,
while
still
taking
advantage
of
that
portion
of
the
statute
which
allows
them
to
spend
the
corporate
treasury
funds
to
support
that
fund.
so
that
you
have
a
situation
where
they
really
don't
really
contend
that
the
overall
statute
is
unconstitutional.
they
contend,
for
constitutional
reasons,
that
the
congressional
exception
must
be
broadly
construed
to
allow
them
to
solicit
anyone
who
has
a
similar
political
philosophy,
in
the
phrasing
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
no,
you
certainly
do
not.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
don't
know
whether
they
would
have
challenged
that.
but--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--no,
i
think--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--no,
certainly
in
that
sense,
if
they
had
an
externalized
offering--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
don't
think
we
would
be
here
if
they
had
what
we
would
consider
a
genuine
membership
structure.
but
here,--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
don't
think
that
they
did
because--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--they
sent
them
a
piece
of
paper
at
the
end
of
the
year
at
the
end
on
the
renewal
saying
we
want
you
to
renew
your
membership.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
but
when
they
solicited
them,
they
never
told
them
that
they
were
soliciting
them
for
membership.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
a
policy
of
the
organization
i
think
is
a
strong
statement
of
it.
they
have
then
decided
to
solicit
people
who--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
think
that
the
commission
in
its
opinions
has
said
that
you
have,
at
the
very
least,
to
have
that.
if
you
are
within
a
state
law
you
have
to
be
organized
as
a
membership
fund--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--in
the
commission's
view,
you
would
have
to
have
a
voluntary
acceptance
of
that.
in
other
words,
that
you
would
have
to
have--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--that
you
not
only
have
to
have
that...
and
in
a
knowing
sense,
that
people
know
that.
and
the
reason
i
quibble
with
that
is
whether
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
said
this
makes
you
a
member,
as
opposed
to
an
invitation,
we
would
like
you
to
join
as
a
member,
would
raise
questions
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
the
membership
was
a
voluntary,
knowing
decision.
because
the
entire
premise
of
the
commission's
regulations
is
that
there
are
requirements
for
membership
and
that
those
be
made
known
to
those
people
that
come
forward.
i
would
add
that
in
addition
to
that,
the
commission
feels
that
there
has
to
be
some
measure
of
rights
and
obligations
coming
to
the
members.
that
what
congress
was
here
seeking
and
what
the
history
of
the
amendment
in
1976
says,
is
that
it
was
a
parallel
to
the
shareholder
and
member
definitions
for
unions
and
corporations,
and
that
you
have
some
form
of
fiduciary
relationship;
something
comparable
to
the
fiduciary
relationship
there.
that
you
have
some
kind
of--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--not
if
they
organized
themselves
as
a
membership
corporation.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
they
don't
have
members
under
state
law.
it
would
be
consistent
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--well,
they
would
have
to
give
them
notice
of
annual
meeting.
they
would
have
to
give
them,
under
the
virginia
law,
they
would
have
to
give
them
the
rights
of
members
in
a
membership
organization--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--not
without
constituting
themselves
a
membership
organization,
which
carries
with
it
certain
obligations
to
its
members.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
and
they
did
not.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
no,
i
do
not.
what
i
was
saying
is
that
under
virginia
law,
if
you
have
members,
you
have
obligations
to
them.
and
where--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--that's
the
third
requirement.
the
articles
of
incorporation
have
to
say,
one,
your
name;
two,
your
purpose;
three,
whether
you're
a
membership
corporation,
and
if
you're
not
a
membership
corporation
state
that;
four,
if
you
are
a
membership
corporation,
state
that
and
what
classes
of
membership
you
will
have.
and
there
are
certain
other
requirements
that
flow
from
virginia
law;
most
prominently,
notice--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--these
articles
provided
that
they
were
not
a
membership
organization.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
certainly,
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
have
constitutional
questions
underlying
it
that--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--well,
i
think
it's
really
a
question
of...
i
mean,
the
constitutional
question
in
the
sense
that
if
congress
did
make
that
limitation,
is
there
something
that
prohibits
that.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
well,
the
governmental
interest
i
think,
once
again,
is
in
distinguishing
between
the
overall
statute
where
you
have
a
prohibition
on
corporations
with
the
exceptions
in
between,
that
there's
an
underlying
governmental
purpose
there
of
controlling
the
corporation's
expenditures,
the
amounts.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
it
furthers
it
in
the
same
way
that...
it's
a
quid
pro
quo.
it
furthers
it
in
the
same
way
that
the
restriction
to
shareholders
with
regard
to
a
stock
corporation
furthers
that
law.
it
allows
the
corporation,
which
congress
wishes
to
control
in
a
certain
way,
to
communicate
with
those
people
that
make
it
up,
in
the
terms
of
the
legislation,
that
make
up
the
corporation.
so
it's
a
parallel
and
it
serves
the
same
restriction.
it
deals
with
the
financing
by
the
corporate
body
or
by
the
labor
organization.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
well,
in
regard
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
it
might
be
less
restrictive
if
congress
said
no
corporation
shall
send
more
than
$5000
in
soliciting
anyone,
and
put
them
under
that
restriction
that
was
the
one
in
calpak.
but
again,
i
think
that
congress
has
made
a
balancing
here
between
two
types
of
restrictions,
and
less
restrictive
seems
to
be
a
conclusion
in
that
sense.
they
have
balanced
here
the
two
interests.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
would
think
it
might.
i'm
not
sure
i
follow.
if
you
reach
the
constitutional
question,
the
argument
would
be,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
constitution--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--i
suppose
in
that
sense
that
it's
implicated
here.
on
the
other
hand,
they
don't
challenge
it
because
they
are...
in
other
words,
if
there
was
an
overall
prohibition
on
them
but
they
don't
challenge--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--in
that
sense,
yes,
it
is
implicated
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
no,
your
honor,
unless
there
are
further
questions.
