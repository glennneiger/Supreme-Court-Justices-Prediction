mr.
steele,
if
your
restriction
as
to
membership
is
agreed
to,
then
i
guess
we
get
to
the
constitutional
question,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
isn't
there
a
constitutional
question
here
on
the
premise
of
your
interpretation
of
membership?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
governmental
interest
in
that
limitation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
this
membership
restriction
further
those
interests?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
less
restrictive
way
of
doing
it
than
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
same
limitation
apply
to
the
corporate--

j.
brennan,
jr.
--collection?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
perhaps
suggest
an
equal
protection
problem
lurking
behind
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
med
cal
then
suggests
that
these
classifications
between
individual
and
corporate
committees
would
be...
would
not
run
afoul
of
the
equal
protection?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
say,
are
you
suggesting
that
med
cal
has
said
anything
to
indicate
that
these
classifications
would
pass
muster
under
the...
under
an
equal
protection
attack?
