mr.
steele,
i
suppose
there
could
be
less
restrictive
ways
of
addressing
the
problem.
congress
could,
for
instance,
just
prohibit
the
expenditure
by
the
corporation
of
no
more
than
x
number
of
dollars
for
the
purpose,
could
it
not,
rather
than
prohibiting
any
solicitation
of
its
supporters?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
mansfield,
if
we
were
to
determine
that
indeed,
the
fec
is
right
and
your
organization
did
not
have
members,
and
furthermore,
that
you
were
right
in
arguing
that
the
provision
of
section
441b(b)(a)
is
unconstitutional,
then
would
the
restrictions
in
section
441(a)
still
prohibit
your
company
from
giving
more
than
$5000
to
this
committee
that
it
formed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
what
would
happen?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
that
was
my
assumption.
if
that
were
upheld,
then
your
argument
is
that
some
portion
of
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
as
i
understand
it.
