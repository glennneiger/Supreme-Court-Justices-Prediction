mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
wyoming
enforces
a
mandatory
retirement
policy
for
two
classes
of
individuals.
they
are
both
covered
by
the
same
act.
it
is
the
act
that
is
here
challenged
by
the
eeoc.
the
act
covers
wyoming's
highway
patrol
officers,
and
it
covers
those
game
and
fish
wardens
for
the
state
of
wyoming
who
are
also
full-time
law
enforcement
officers.
it
does
not,
as
the
solicitor
general
suggests,
cover
most
game
and
fish
employees.
so
we
are
talking,
first
of
all,
about
wyoming's
treatment
of
its
law
enforcement
officers,
and
only
its
law
enforcement
officers.
the
solicitor
general
predicates
his
argument
on
the
premise
that
what
we
are
concerned
with
here
today
is
arbitrary
discrimination.
wyoming
suggests
that
this
is
not
arbitrary
discrimination
at
all;
that
this
is
activity
by
a
state
which
is
a
reasonable
classification
based
upon
age,
and
that
therefore,
the
question
for
the
court's
determination
is
simply
whether
or
not
the
10th
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution,
which
embodies
our
constitutional
federalism,
reserves
to
the
state
of
wyoming
the
right
to
treat
its
law
enforcement
officers
and
to
make
fundamental
employment
decisions
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
that
the
united
states
congress
exercises
its
employment
decisions
with
regard
to
federal
law
enforcement
officers.
the
position
of
the
state
of
wyoming
is
that
under
the
commerce
clause,
that
congress
has
no
power
to
regulate
the
states
in
this
fashion.
moreover,
if
the
court
should
reach
the
question
of
whether
or
not
congress
has
any
power
under
section
v
of
the
14th
amendment,
that
that
power
is
insufficient
as
well.
the
requirements
for
determining
whether
or
not
this
is
an
appropriate
exercise
of
congress's
commerce
power,
of
course,
were
set
down
by
this
court
in
national
league
of
cities
versus
usery.
the
tests
are
three.
the
first,
the
act
must
regulate
the
states
as
states.
that
test
is
conceded
by
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case.
the
second
is
that
the
act
must
address
a
matter
which
is
indisputedly
a
matter
of
state
sovereignty.
we
have
some
argument
there.
the
solicitor
general
posits--
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
--yes,
your
honor.
the
solicitor
general
posits
that
the
attribute
of
state
sovereignty
which
wyoming
here
seeks
to
protect
is
the
ability
to
discriminate
arbitrarily.
your
honors,
the
state
of
wyoming
suggests
no
such
thing.
we
do
not
here
suggest
that
it
is
appropriate
for
any
state
to
arbitrarily
discriminate
against
any
employee
on
the
basis
of
age
or
any
other
classification.
the
attribute
of
state
sovereignty
which
we
seek
to
protect
is
the
ability
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
wyoming
to
make
fundamental
employment
decisions.
the
constitution
does
not
vest
the
congress,
nor
does
the
constitution
vest
the
federal
courts
with
the
ability
to
make
employment
decisions
concerning
who
shall
be
a
law
enforcement
officer
in
the
state
of
wyoming.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
your
honor,
wyoming
could
not
have
such
a
law
because
sex
discrimination
is
unconstitutional
in
this
context.
understand
that
in
this
case,
although
the
solicitor
general
chooses
to
call
this
arbitrary
discrimination,
what
we
have
here
is
clearly
not
arbitrary
discrimination.
the
solicitor
general
does
not
argue...
no
one
in
this
case
argues...
that
what
wyoming
has
done
here
violates
the
constitution.
the
distinction
between
what
wyoming
has
done
is
that
this
conduct
is
constitutionally
permissible;
whereas,
a
statute
which
presumed
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex
would
clearly
be
unconstitutional.
wyoming
has
no
reserved
right
under
the
10th
amendment
to
violate
the
constitution.
wyoming
does
have
a
right
that
is
embodied
in
the
10th
amendment
to
make
its
own
fundamental
decisions.
this
court
recognized
last
term
in
fer
versus
mississippi
that
perhaps
the
quintessential
attribute
of
state
sovereignty
is
the
ability
to
make
decisions
in
areas--
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
--your
honor,
we
submit
that
the
only
issue
here
is
the
10th
amendment
issue.
because
lower
courts
and
solicitor
general
have
argued--
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
in
this
particular
case,
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
the
court
would
not
have
to.
but
we
might
be
right
back
here,
no
matter
what.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
well,
your
honor,
we
certainly
raise
the
same
arguments
that
we
raised
before
the
district
court.
because
the
district
court
did
not
get
past
the
10th
amendment
issue--
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
--we
are
appellant,
your
honor.
excuse
me,
appellee.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
the
third
test
of
national
league
of
cities
versus
usery
is
whether
or
not
the
regulation
interferes
with
the
ability
of
the
state
to
structure
integral
operations
of
traditional
state
functions.
the
problem
that
we
wish
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
is
that
the
interference
that
is
presented
by
this
act
is
the
most
severe
interference
that
could
possibly
be
made
by
congress.
congress
is
attempting
to
instruct
the
states
on
who
its
game
and
fish
wardens
will
be.
congress
is
saying,
in
essence,
if
the
construction
of
the
eeoc
is
correct,
that
wyoming...
we
would
not
retain
this
particular
individual
solely
because
he
is
55.
however,
you
must
retain
him,
even
though
he
is
55.
or
in
the
alternative,
go
into
a
federal
court
and
justify
the
rationality
of
your
decision.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
your
honor,
it's
more
intrusive.
the
reason
is
because
we
would
submit
it's
not
merely
telling
us
how
much
to
pay;
it's
telling
us
who
will
deliver
the
essential
governmental
services
that
the
state
of
wyoming
has
a
right
to
deliver
to
its
citizens.
it
is
saying
you
will
have
police
officers
who
are
over
a
certain
age
after
the
state
legislature
has
made
a
decision
that
is
properly
vested
in
the
state
legislature
under
the
constitution
that
those
individuals
will
not
deliver
the
state
police
services
to
the
people
in
the
state
of
wyoming.
in
that
regard,
this
is
far
more
intrusive
than
the
case
was
in
national
league
of
cities
versus
usery.
the
integral
operations
of
any
state
system,
of
any
state
function,
of
any
traditional
state
function,
it
seems
to
wyoming
depends
integrally
on
who
delivers
the
function
itself.
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
the
existence
of
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
vindicates
the
state's
ability
to
make
these
sorts
of
decisions,
so
long
as
the
state
is
able
to
show
a
rational
basis
for
the
decision.
that
ignores
what
the
bfoq
does.
first,
the
bfoq
turns
equal
protection
analysis...
and
i
speak
of
equal
protection
analysis
because
it's
impossible
to
talk
about
reasonable
classifications
even
in
the
commerce
sense
without
talking
about
equal
protection...
the
reason
that
bfoq
does
not
suffice
is
twofold.
first,
the
bfoq
defense
forces
the
state
of
wyoming
to
justify
its
admittedly
constitutional
conduct
to
a
federal
court.
again,
no
one
in
the
case
suggests
that
what
wyoming
has
done
by
requiring
our
law
enforcement
officers
to
retire
is
unconstitutional.
that
is
because
everyone
recognizes
that
this
court's
decision
in
mass.
versus
murgia
would
control.
nonetheless,
the
congress,
through
the
enactment
of
the
bfoq
defense,
is
the
only
method
for
the
state
of
wyoming
to
vindicate
its
constitutional
conduct.
it
forces
wyoming
to
go
into
court
and
bear
an
unconstitutional
burden;
unconstitutional
in
the
sense
that
it
requires
far
more
for
the
vindication
of
its
constitutional
conduct
than
this
court
would
require.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history,
your
honor,
that
the
congress
treats
its
own
law
enforcement
officers
as
being
presumptively
entitled
to
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification.
it
seems,
therefore,
to
me
to
be
clear
that
the
court
could
decide
as
a
matter
of
law
that
wyoming
is
entitled
to
the
same
bfoq
as
a
matter
of
law--
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
--it
would
certainly
solve
our
problem
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
the
theory
is,
your
honor,
that
there
is
no
constitutionally
significant
difference
in
the
facts
between
the
federal
government's
across-the-board
requirement
for
its
law
enforcement
officers...
and
understand
that
it's
not
little
enclaves.
the
legislative
history
which
supports
the
reduction
in
1974
of
the
mandatory
retirement
age
for
federal
law
enforcement
officers
indicates
that
they
were
talking
about
41,600
individuals
in
the
federal
service.
we're
not
talking
about
something
that's
nominal.
the
point
is
that
if
it
is
possible
to
find
that
law
enforcement
as
a
generic
term
would
entitle
a
state
or
the
federal
government
to
a
bfoq
in
age
discrimination
matters,
it
shouldn't
be
any
different
for
the
federal
government
than
it
is
for
the
states.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
no,
your
honor.
there
are
many
references
in
the
briefs
and
the
legislative
history
to
statements
made
that
the
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
bfoq
defense,
was
recognizing
that
there
were
certain
physically
strenuous
occupations
that
the
states
control,
including
law
enforcement
occupations,
fire
fighter
occupations
and
those
sorts
of
things,
which
the
bfoq
was
specifically
designed
to
protect.
the
problem
occurs
because
this
court's
test
in
terms
of
the
states
protecting
its
constitutional
right
to
make
fundamental
employment
decisions
is
one
of
mere
rationality.
the
bfoq,
on
the
other
hand,
as
you
recognized
in
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
imposes
quite
a
different
burden.
the
burden
is
all
or
substantially
all
employees
above
a
certain
age
are
incapable
of
performing
the
functions,
and
moreover,
that
it
is
impossible
or
impractical
to
test
individually
for
the
particular
factor
that
you
are
trying
to
determine,
such
that
age
is
the
only
reasonable
qualifier.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
all
law
enforcement
officers?
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
no,
your
honor.
i'm
saying--
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
--let
me
say
it
this
way,
your
honor,--
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
--the
record,
as
the
solicitor
general
points
out,
consists
only
of
a
complaint.
and
of
course,
since
the
complaint
was
dismissed,
the
factual
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
deemed
to
be
true.
however,
that
doesn't
mean
that
our
record
is
devoid
of
evidence
about
what
these
people
do.
the
court
can
judicially
notice
the
statutes
in
the
state
of
wyoming
which
set
certain
of
the
requirements
for
wyoming
game
and
fish
wardens
who
are
law
enforcement
officers.
they
include
generally,
the
enforcement
of
the
game
and
fish
violations.
that's
poaching,
license
violations,
the
taking
of
an
elk
out
of
season.
it
is
not,
it
seems
to
me,
a
very
severe
leaving
of
the
record
to
take
the
next
step
by
implication
and
understand
that
those
violations
do
not
occur,
by
and
large,
on
the
streets
of
cheyenne,
wyoming
but
rather,
occur
during
hunting
season
in
areas
where
hunting
occurs.
so
it's
clear
enough
from
this
record
that
the
court
can
determine
that
the
duties
that
are
set
by
wyoming
statute
for
these
particular
law
enforcement
officers
are
strenuous
indeed.
now,
the
lower
courts
have
avoided
the
10th
amendment
constitutional
challenge,
and
found
that
rather
than
this
statute
being
an
exercise
of
the
10th
amendment...
excuse
me,
of
the
commerce
power...
they
have
assumed
that
congress
used
its
section
v
power
under
the
14th
amendment.
the
solicitor
general
states
that
this
court's
ruling
last
year
in
pennhurst
cannot
apply
to
this
case
simply
because
it
is
clear
from
this
statute
that
the
congress
intended
to
regulate
the
states.
we
submit
that
that
is
not
the
question
to
ask.
the
question
that
was
decided
in
pennhurst
is
whether
absent
an
indication
of...
absent
an
express
statement
of
an
intent
to
enforce
section
v
of
14,
courts
should
not
lightly
assume
that
congress,
in
fact,
did
that.
we
are
not
requiring
or
asking
this
court
to
require
that
congress
adopt
legislative
history.
we
clearly
cannot
do
that.
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
do
that.
we
are
simply
asking
the
court
to
follow
what
seems
to
us
to
be
a
very
clear
statement
of
the
rule
in
pennhurst,
and
find
that
there
is
no
reason
to
go
to
the
14th
amendment
analysis,
because
congress
never
once
expressed
any
intent
that
that's
what
it
wished
to
enforce.
the
legislative
history
that
the
solicitor
general
relies
on
in
making
his
conclusion,
it
seems
to
us,
is
simply
insufficient
to
reach
the
question.
there
are
certainly
vague
allusions
to
discrimination;
there
are
statements
in
the
legislative
history
which
state
that
the
effects
of
age
discrimination
are
as
bad
as
the
effects
of
racial
discrimination
or
discriminations
based
upon
sex,
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
but
to
say
that
the
effects
of
age
discrimination
are
as
bad
as
the
effects
of
racial
discrimination
or
discriminations
based
upon
sex
is
not
to
say
that
the
congress
is
therefore
using
its
section
v
enforcement
power
in
order
to--
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
--it
would
certainly
be
a
different
case,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
it's
proper
for
the
court
to
assume
that
the
section
v
power
exists.
it
would
be
no
different
in
the
result.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
no,
your
honor.
clearly
not.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
i
am
saying
this,
your
honor,
that
if
you
use
pennhurst,
you
never
reach
the
second
question.
if
you
find
that
pennhurst
is
no
bar,
then
you
reach
the
second
question
but
the
result
is
the
same.
because
we
believe
that
the
14th
amendment
power
is
also
insufficient
to
regulate
the
states
in
this
manner.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
no,
your
honor,
i
need
to
clarify
that
because
my
argument
has
apparently
been
misapprehended.
our
position
is
this.
the
14th
amendment
enforcement
power
grants
the
congress
very
broad
power
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
amendment
itself.
this
court
has
held
many
times
that
that
power
is
plenary
within
the
terms
of
the
grant.
our
position
is
that
adea
is
not
appropriate
legislation
to
enforce
the
14th
amendment
simply
because
what
the
state
has
done
here...
and
i
need
to
limit
myself
to
the
application
in
this
case...
what
the
state
has
done
here
is
not
a
constitutional
violation.
now,
the
14th
amendment
grants
to
congress
basically
three
powers.
of
course,
it
grants
the
congress
the
ability
to
prohibit
conduct
which
in
and
of
itself
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
further,
it
also
grants
to
congress
the
ability
to
pass
legislation
which
remedies
the
current
effects
of
past
constitutional
violations.
and
finally,
it
grants
to
congress
the
power
to
enact
legislation
which
prohibits
conduct
which
the
congress
finds
would
present
a
risk
of
future
discriminations,
future
constitutional
violations.
in
this
case,
we
have
none
of
those
situations,
and
the
congress
recognized
that.
the
congress
in
its
legislative
history
immediately
prior
to
passing
its
law
prohibiting
mandatory
retirements
said
if
the
courts
are
not
going
to
declare
this
conduct
unconstitutional,
we
must
act
to
make
it
illegal.
we
say
fine
and
good.
the
congress
has
the
power
to
make
mandatory
retirement
illegal
under
the
commerce
clause.
but
the
congress
has
no
power
to
address
an
evil
pursuant
to
the
14th
amendment
which
is
not
contemplated
by
the
amendment
itself.
now,--
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
--that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
and
this
court
held
as
much
in
national
league
of
cities
versus
usery.
the
analysis
was
limited
to
the
congress's
commerce
power,
and
that
was
precisely
the
holding
of
the
case;
that
the
10th
amendment
is
an
affirmative
bar
to
the
exercise
of
congressional
power
under
the
commerce
clause,
which
is
otherwise
appropriate.
no
one
said
that
the
congress
could
not
have
enacted
federal
minimum
wage
laws
under
the
commerce
power
because
it
clearly
had
that
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
in
that
fashion.
however,
when
it
came
to
regulating
the
states,
the
10th
amendment
was
an
affirmative
limitation
on
congress's
ability
to
do
so.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
it's
a
difficult
question
to
speculate
about,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
clearly
not.
because
the
10th
amendment,
again,
is
no
bar
to
congressional
action
which
prohibits
a
state
constitutional
violation.
the
state
does
not
reserve
to
itself
any
power
to
act
unconstitutionally.
finally,
your
honor,
i
need
to
discuss
the
problem
of
the
closer
fit.
the
solicitor
general's
argument
is
that
congress,
notwithstanding
this
court's
ruling
in
massachusetts
board
of
retirement
versus
murgia,
has
the
power
to
require
a
closer
fit
between
the
goals
which
the
state
may
legitimately
have,
and
the
means
which
the
state
chooses
to
get
there.
as
applied
in
this
case,
that
argument
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
congress
has
the
power
to
overrule
this
court
on
questions
of
constitutional
law.
the
congress
has
no--
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
--pardon
me?
the
statute
itself
is
what
is
being
challenged.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
no,
your
honor.
the
statute
authorizes--
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
salzburg
your
honor,
the
solicitor
general
presents
the
closer
fit
argument
as
justification
for
the
constitutionality
of
the
act.
i
wish
to
address
the
argument
to
demonstrate
that
his
conclusion
is
wrong
that
the
act
cannot
be...
that
congress
has
no
such
power
to
constitutionally
require
a
fit
beyond
what
this
court
has
required
in
determining
equal
protection
cases,
if
in
fact
this
was
an
exercise
of
any
equal
protection
enforcement
power.
your
honors,
for
the
reasons
that
i've
just
stated,
we
would
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
state
of
wyoming
to
retire
its
law
enforcement
officers
be
affirmed.
