justice
john
paul
stevens
general
lee,
supposing
we
just
confine
ourselves
for
the
moment
to
the
first
ground,
the
interest
in
the
work
force,
and
congress
found
that
it
would
be,
there's
a
shortage
of
jobs
and
it
would
be
better
to
have
younger
men
occupying
these
positions
in
the
long
run
and
that
therefore,
they
imposed
a
mandatory
retirement
age
of
55
for
nationwide,
game
wardens,
law
enforcement
people
throughout
the
country.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
earlier,
you
said
the
case
was
really
one
of
drawing
the
line
with
greater
precision.
it
seems
to
me
the
question
is,
rather,
congress
has
decided
who
shall
be
drawing
the
line.
because
they
say
the
eeoc
shall
draw
the
line,
not
the
state
of
wyoming.
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
that
merely
say
that
age...
you
assume
for
purposes
of
a
decision
that
it's
protected,
and
then
go
ahead
and
make
the
analysis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
salzburg,
supposing
that
wyoming
had
a
law
that
said
all
game
wardens
shall
be
men?
could
the
federal
government
prohibit
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you...
it
really
is
the
second
half
of
your
opponent's
argument.
supposing
the
statute
said
pursuant
to
the
powers
vested
by
section
v
of
the
14th
amendment,
congress
hereby
adopts
the
following
law,
and
they
re-enacted
the
law.
would
that
be
a
difference
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
scope
of
their
power
depend
on
what
they
say
at
the
outset
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
can't
we
assume
that
they
did,
in
effect,
say
that,
and
still
have
the
same
problem
that
you
won't
argue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
why
is
that?
is
that
because
discrimination
on
account
of
age
is
simply
not...
it
would
never
be
subject
to
the
14th
amendment?
