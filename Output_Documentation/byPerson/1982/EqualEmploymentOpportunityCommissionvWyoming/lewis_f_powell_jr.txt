justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
to
say,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
if
congress
enacted
the
statute
requiring
retirement
of
all
federal
law
enforcement
officers
to
retire
at
age
55,
that
that
would
be
valid?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
wouldn't
that
be
equally
discriminatory?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
were
talking
about
discrimination
against
the
people
in
this
case
who
are
compelled
to
retire
at
55.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
federal
employees
would
similarly
be
discriminated
against.
