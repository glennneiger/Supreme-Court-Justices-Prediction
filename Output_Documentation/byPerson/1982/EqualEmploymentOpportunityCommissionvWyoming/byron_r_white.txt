isn't
the
only
issue
here
the
10th
amendment
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
we
reversed
the
judgment
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional
on
10th
amendment
grounds?
if
we
decide
that
the
decision
was
wrong,
that's
all
we
would
do,
isn't
it?
there
may
be
some
more
left
to
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
we
have
to
go
on
to
issues
that
were
never
decided
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be,
but
the
only
question
raised
in
the
papers
and
argued
in
the
briefs
is
the
10th
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
respondent
here,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
appellee.
and
you
described
the
question
as
a
single
question;
whether
the
age
discrimination
act
is
unconstitutional
on
10th
amendment
grounds.
that's
the
only
question
that's
here.
it's
the
only
question
the
government
presented.
justice
byron
r.
white
again,
do
you
think
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
wyoming
regulation
or
statute...
it's
a
regulation,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
imposition
of
the
age
requirement
was
by
regulation,
wasn't
it,
under
this
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
any
event,
what
is
the
statute
or
regulation?
the
issue
here
isn't
whether
it
violates
the
age
discrimination
act,
is
it?
that
isn't
the
issue
here.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
age
discrimination
act
is
constitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
just
responding
about
the
closer
fit
because
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
an
issue
that
isn't
here?
