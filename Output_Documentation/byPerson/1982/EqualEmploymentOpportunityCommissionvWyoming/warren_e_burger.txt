chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
eeoc
against
wyoming.
general,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
recall,
mr.
solicitor
general,
whether
in
murgia
there
was
any
subjective
evidence
with
respect
to
capacity
to
perform
the
job?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
relation
to
the
particular--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--or
men
under
a
particular
age?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
recall
the
case
involving
the
foreign
service
officers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
certainly
there
was
a
policy
decision
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
that
there
was
an
inherent
impediment
on
foreign
service
officers
after
reaching
the
age
of
60.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
that
relate
to
the
question
justice
o'connor
put
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
compare
the
functions
of
a
game
warden
with
the
functions
of
the
officer
involved
in
the
murgia
and,
i
think,
feeney
cases?
or
with
an
fbi
agent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
that
part
of
the
theory
in
congress
in
putting
a
limit
on
the
foreign
service
officers
so
that
there
would
be
an
inducement
for
younger
people
to
get
in
the
system
and
not
have
these
over-aged
men
of
60
blocking
their
progress?
[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
general
lee,--
--doesn't
this
action
of
congress
in
the
position
you're
taking
reject
the
concept
that
is
associated
with
justice
brandeis
that
the
state
should
be
allowed
to
have
wide
latitude
in
experimenting
with
various
programs?
they
might
find,
for
example,
that
in
florida
after
a
period
of
time
the
game
wardens
and
police
officers
would
last
longer
than
they
would
in
the
rigorous
climate
of
wyoming.
isn't
that
the
whole
concept
of
brandeis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
by
that,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
congress
was
acting
on
a
stereotype
with
respect
to
foreign
service
officers,
fbi
agents,
military
people,
where
they
have
arbitrary
retirement
ages,
all
of
them
down
the
line?
is
that
a
stereotype
or
is
that
a
considered
judgment
in
how
to
manage
their
responsibilities?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suppose
congress
was
experimenting
on
the
states
collectively
in
this
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
salzburg?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
your
broader
position
that
the
states
have
never
delegated
to
the
federal
government
the
authority
to
tell
them
how
to
run
the
state
government
in
terms
of
its
employment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
before
the
14th
amendment,
the
states
could
have
discriminated
against
women
on
police
forces?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
any
rate,
after
the
14th
amendment
they
could
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
brennan
will
announce
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
against
wyoming.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
justice
brennan.
