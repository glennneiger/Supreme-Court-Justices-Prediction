general
lee,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
itself
has
imposed
a
mandatory
retirement
age
for
similarly
situated
federal
personnel,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
that
indicates
to
us
that
there
is
a
bfoq
defense
for
the
state
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
salzburg,
do
you
think
it's
open
to
us
to
decide
that
wyoming
has
established
a
bfoq
defense
as
a
matter
of
law
because
of
the
congressional
enactment
exempting
its
own
law
enforcement
personnel
from
application
of
the
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
that
solve
your
problem?
