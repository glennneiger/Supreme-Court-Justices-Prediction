justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
wyoming.
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
of
1967
makes
it
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
discriminate
against
any
employee
or
potential
employee
between
the
ages
of
40
and
70
on
the
basis
of
age
with
a
certain
important
exception.
in
1974,
the
definition
of
"employer"
under
section
11(b)
of
the
act
was
extended
was
extended
by
congress
to
include
state
and
local
governments.
after
a
supervisor
for
the
wyoming
game
and
fish
department
was
involuntarily
retired
at
age
55
pursuant
to
a
wyoming
statute,
he
filed
a
complaint
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
alleging
violation
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act.
the
commission
ultimately
filed
suit
in
federal
district
court
against
the
appellees,
the
state
of
wyoming
and
various
state
officials,
seeking
relief
on
behalf
of
the
supervisor
and
others
similarly
situated.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
suit,
holding
that
insofar
as
the
act
regulated
wyoming's
employment
relationship
with
its
game
wardens
and
other
law
enforcement
officials,
it
violated
the
doctrine
of
tenth
amendment
immunity
articulated
in
national
league
of
cities
versus
usery,
a
case
decided
by
this
court
a
few
terms
ago.
that
case
struck
down
congress'
attempt
to
extend
the
wage
and
hour
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
state
and
local
governments.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
we
hold
that
national
league
of
cities
versus
usery
is
in
applicable
in
this
case.
rather,
we
hold
the
extension
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
to
cover
state
and
local
governments
is
a
valid
exercise
of
congress'
powers
under
the
commerce
clause,
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied
in
this
case,
and
is
not
precluded
by
virtue
of
external
constraints
imposed
on
congress'
commerce
powers
by
the
tenth
amendment.
justice
stevens
has
joined
the
court
opinion
and
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
powell,
justice
rehnquist
and
justice
o'connor
have
joined.
