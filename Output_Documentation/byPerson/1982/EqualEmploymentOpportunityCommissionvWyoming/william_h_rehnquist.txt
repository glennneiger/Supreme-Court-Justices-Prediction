justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
lee,
in
amplification
of
justice
stevens'
question,
supposing
that
congress
imposed
a
mandatory
retirement
age
of
50,
feeling
that
it
really
wanted
to
get
the
younger
people
up
there,
and
wyoming
came
with
a
showing
that
half
of
its
game
wardens
were
over
50,
and
therefore,
it
really
was
impairing
its
right
to
structure
its
own
employment
system?
that
would
be
a
fair
amount
closer
to
the
application
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
your
description,
congress
was
a
good
deal
more
stringent
than
that,
if
the
principle
of
the
bfoc
is
that
all
or
substantially
all
have
to
be
disabled
from
performing.
that's
a
very
difficult
requirement
for
any
state
to
show.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
has
virtually
outlawed
any
sort
of
a
mandatory
retirement
age.
under
the
adea
would
it
be
permissible
for,
say,
wyoming
or
some
other
state
to
say
we
think
that
we
want
to
take
it
on
a
more
individualized
basis,
but
we
also
think
that
as
you
go
past
55,
you
run
more
of
a
risk.
so
although
we
require
physicals
every
two
years
for
people
under
55,
we're
going
to
require
physicals
every
six
months
for
people
over
55?
or
would
the
eeoc
say
that's
age
discrimination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
doesn't
mean
the
eeoc
wouldn't
say
it's
age
discrimination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
personally
acquainted
with
him
that
you
refer
to
him
by
name
all
the
time,
or
is
it
just
kind
of
an
argument
tool?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
statement
did
murgia
make
about
the
constitution
protecting
against
age
discrimination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
find
that
a
very
satisfying
analysis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
salzburg,
this
isn't
as
intrusive,
is
it,
as
making
the
fair
labor
standards
act
applicable,
where
in
effect,
the
government
would
have
been
telling
wyoming
what
to
pay
to
every
single
state
employee?
this
is
just
shearing
off
a
few
at
the
further
end
of
the
age
spectrum
and
saying
them
you
may
have
to
treat
somewhat
differently
than
you
want
to.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
theory
on
which
we
would
reach
such
a
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
we
wouldn't
do
it
as
a
matter
of
congressional
intent,
then,
because
there's
no
indication
that
i
can
find
that
congress
intended
age
to
be
an
automatic
bfoq
in
the
case
where
it
was
applying
the
adea
to
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
are
a
number
of
federal
employees
who
are
not
subject
to
as
stringent
limitations
on
retirement
as
the
state
of
wyoming's
will
be,
isn't
that
true?
