mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
prohibits
the
federal
government,
with
some
exceptions,
from
employment
discrimination
based
on
age,
regardless
of
the
employee's
age;
and
prohibits
other
employers
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
from
such
discrimination
against
employees
between
the
ages
of
40
and
70.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
that
provision
of
the
1974
amendment
to
that
act,
which
extended
provisions
to
state
and
local
government
employees.
bill
crump,
who
was
employed
as
a
district
game
supervisor
by
the
wyoming
game
and
fish
department
was
forced
to
retire
at
age
55,
pursuant
to
a
wyoming
statute
which,
with
some
exceptions,
requires
the
retirement
of
all
game
and
fish
department
employees
at
age
55.
mr.
crump
filed
a
charge
of
unlawful
age
discrimination
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
which
in
turn
filed
this
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
wyoming
seeking
declaratory
relief,
back
pay
and
liquidated
damages
for
persons
adversely
affected
by
the
state's
retirement
policy.
the
district
court
granted
the
state's
motion
to
dismiss
on
10th
amendment,
national
league
of
cities
and
towns
versus
usery
grounds.
because
the
case
comes
to
this
court
in
the
posture
of
a
granted
motion
to
dismiss,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
either
bill
crump
individually
or
wyoming
game
wardens
55
years
old
as
a
group
are,
in
fact,
less
fit
to
perform
their
duties
because
of
the
fact
that
they
have
turned
55.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
believe
there
was.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
to
mr.
murgia.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
evidence
in
that
case,
as
i
recall,
was
that
there
was
a
general
deterioration
of
certain
physical
abilities
that
were
related
to
capacity
to
perform
as
members
of
the
uniformed
police
force.
and
the
evidence
similarly
was
that
as
to
mr.
murgia,
whatever
his
name
was,
that
it
had
not
happened
in
his
case.
congress's
congressional
authority
to
extend
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
to
state
and
local
governments
can
be
found
in
either
of
two
separate
sources;
the
commerce
clause
and
section
v
of
the
14th
amendment.
i
will
discuss
each
of
them
separately.
with
regard
to
the
commerce
clause,
the
issue
is
whether
the
state
of
wyoming
has
satisfied
each
of
the
three
hurdles
plus
the
balancing
test
specified
by
this
court
in
national
league
of
cities
and
towns
versus
usery
and
hodel
versus
virginia
surface
mining.
it
is
common
ground
that
the
adea
regulates
the
states
as
states.
but
beyond
that,
wyoming
has
not
made
its
case
and
cannot.
the
reasons,
which
are
spelled
out
in
more
detail,
can
be
best
summarized
and
put
in
most
helpful
perspective
by
examining
just
what
it
is
that
wyoming
seeks
to
do
with
its
mandatory
retirement
program,
and
the
impact
of
congress's
statute
on
the
achievement
of
that
objective.
the
state
itself
has
identified
its
goal.
it
is,
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
state's
brief,
"to
assure
the
physical
preparedness
of
wyoming
game
wardens
to
perform
their
duties.
"
the
only
effect
of
the
congressional
requirement
on
that
concededly
proper
state
goal
is
to
require
a
tighter
fit
between
the
goal
and
the
means
for
achieving
it.
there
are
two
basic
approaches
to
the
problem
of
eliminating
from
the
work
force
those
whose
age
impedes
effective
performance.
the
first
is
a
presumptive
group
approach,
in
which
all
members
of
the
class
are
automatically
swept
out,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
everyone
recognizes,
as
was
true
in
murgia,
that
some
members
of
that
group
are
under
no
age
disability.
the
advantage
of
this
concededly
over-inclusive
approach
is
that
it's
easier
to
administer,
and
the
court
held
in
murgia
that
it
satisfies
the
rational
basis
test.
the
other
approach
is
to
determine
on
an
individual
basis
those
particular
persons
who
are
and
those
who
are
not
less
able
to
perform
because
of
age.
the
starting
point
for
analysis
is
that
congress
has
not
prohibited
the
group
approach.
the
adea
permits
the
mandatory
retirement
of
groups
as
groups,
rather
than
individuals
as
individuals,
which
of
course
is
always
available
to
the
state,
so
long
as
the
state
can
show
that
in
fact,
age
is
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
for
the
group
to
which
the
dragnet
is
to
be
applied.
the
key
element
in
proving
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification,
according
to
the
test
that
has
been
approved
by
almost
all
of
the
federal
courts
that
have
faced
the
issue,
is
proof
that
all
or
substantially
all
persons
beyond
the
designated
age
are
unable
to
perform
the
job
safely
and
effectively.
now,
the
sensible
premise
of
this
requirement
is
that
if
all
or
almost
all
the
members
of
the
group
share
the
disability,
then
the
group
approach
is
appropriate
to
identify
the
disability.
age
is
then
a
proxy
for
disability,
because
by
hypothesis,
it
is
shared
by
virtually
all
of
the
members
of
the
group.
therefore,
under
the
adea,
the
state's
very
proper
goal
of
weeding
out
the
age-impaired
from
its
work
force
can
be
achieved
by
either
of
two
means.
one,
a
mandatory
retirement
program
applicable
to
all
members
of
the
group
if
the
state
can
show
that,
in
fact,
as
to
that
group,
the
approach
does
identify
the
age-impaired
with
sufficient
precision
as
to
all
members
of
the
group.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
it
is
true
that
congress,
in
its
1978
amendment,
did
consider
the
possibility
of
these
little
enclaves
of
federal
employees
whom
it
was
leaving,
who
were
still
subject
to
mandatory
requirements.
and
there
was
a
proposal
at
that
time
to
eliminate
all
of
those.
it
is
fairly
apparent
from
the
legislative
history,
as
is
spelled
out
from
our
brief
statements
by
representative
spellman
and
representative
hawkins.
the
reason
that
that
was
not
done
is
that
some
of
these
enclaves
applying
to
such
people
as
cia,
air
traffic
controllers,
law
enforcement
and
fire
fighters
and
some
others,
were
subject
to
the
jurisdiction,
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
other
committees
and
they
did
not
want
to
trounce
on
their
turf
before
giving
them
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
that
issue.
but
insofar
as
the
constitutional
significance
is
concerned,
here
i
submit
is
the
only
significance
of
the
fact
that
congress
has
not
extended
this
rule
yet
to
all
federal
employees.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
vance
versus
bradley,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
certainly
does.
and
what
that
shows
is
that
either
congress
or
any
other
legislative
policy-making
body,
including
the
state
of
wyoming
or
including
the
state
of
massachusetts,
may
conclude
by
legislative
action
that
mandatory
retirement
programs
are
constitutional,
or
at
least
that
they
are
required
in
the
interest
of
the
achievement
of
some
state
objective.
and
if
that's
all
you
have,
then
it
passes
constitutional
muster.
that's
vance
versus
bradley,
and
that's
murgia
versus...
that's
massachusetts
board
of
retirement
versus
murgia.
what
you
have
in
this
case
applicable
to
wyoming
is
an
additional
element,
and
that
is
a
supervening
legislative
judgment
that
in
certain
kinds
of
contexts
the
line
should
be
drawn
with
greater
precision,
and
for
reasons
that
i
will
discuss,
congress
also
has
the
right
to
make
that
decision.
the
only
argument
that
can
be
made
against
it
is
that
congress
has
been
under-inclusive,
and
particularly
with
respect
to
congress's
both
commerce
clause
judgments
and
also
14th
amendment
judgments.
the
under-inclusive
argument
simply
has
not
met
with
much
success.
the
most
that
you
can
say
is
that
congress
has
been
somewhat
inconsistent,
or
at
least
that
it
has
not
yet
taken
the
ultimate
step
that
complete
consistency
might
indicate
it
should.
but
that
is
not
sufficient
basis
to
render
it
unconstitutional.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
or
with
an
fbi
agent.
this...
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
case
in
which
the
case
for
mandatory
retirement
is
less
strong
than
it
is
in
the
case
of
bill
crump,
because
he
was
not
just
a
game
warden;
he
was
a
game
warden
supervisor,
which
was
basically
a
supervisory
kind
of
responsibility.
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
that
it
does
not
rise
to
the
same
level
as
the
foreign
service
employees
in
vance,
or
the
uniformed
police
in
murgia.
but
that
is
not
the
controlling
point.
the
controlling
point
is
that
just
as
this
court
very
properly
held
in
murgia
and
vance
versus
bradley,
that
it
does
not
violate
the
14th
amendment
for
a
policy-making
body
to
adopt
a
mandatory
retirement
program.
and,
just
as
for
reasons
that
i
will
discuss,
it
is
also
constitutional
for
congress,
pursuant
to
its
commerce
and
its
14th
amendment
powers,
to
prescribe
that
in
certain
contexts
to
be
identified
by
congress
more
is
required
than
the
dragnet
approach
of
the
broad,
overall
inclusive
approach
is
also
constitutional.
the
fact
that
congress
does
both
at
the
same
time
and
that
those
exist
side
by
side
does
not
affect
the
constitutionality
of
either,
because
the
constitutionality
of
both
rests
on
separate
grounds.
that
is
perhaps
best
illustrated
when
we
turn
to
the
comparison
of
the
state
and
federal
interests,
the
final
inquiry
that
is
specified
by
hodel
and
usery.
on
the
state's
side,
the
state's
objective
in
maintaining
a
physically
fit
game
warden
force
is
left
intact
by
the
adea.
the
only
requirement
is
that
fitness
itself
must
be
the
inquiry,
and
unlike
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
adea
does
not
prescribe
to
the
states
any
level
of
expenditures.
the
countervailing
federal
interest
by
contrast
is
weighty;
it
is
threefold.
the
first
is
prevention
of
unnecessary
unemployment
and
lack
of
productive
capacity
in
areas
of
endeavor
affecting
interstate
commerce.
congress
had
before
it
evidence
which
indicated
that
the
magnitude
of
that
loss
of
productive
endeavor
throughout
the
united
states
was
on
the
order
of
several
billion
dollars
a
year.
the
second
is
the
prevention
of
unnecessary
demands
on
the
federal
social
security
system.
and
third
and
perhaps
most
important
of
all
was
the
prevention
of
arbitrary
discrimination.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
it
would
be
constitutional
under
murgia.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
was
a
much
more
powerful
argument
to
me
a
few
years
ago
than
it
is
right
now.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
it
would
be
a
fair
amount
closer,
yes,
because
it
does...
while
hodel
said
that
economic
impact
alone
is
not
sufficient,
it
certainly
is
relevant.
and
at
least
you
would
have
an
economic
impact
at
that
point.
i
think
the
point,
justice
stevens,
and
chief
justice
burger,
in
answer
to
both
of
your
questions
is
this.
that
these
are
difficult
policy
questions.
and
they
are
questions
that
can
be
resolved
either
by
the
group
approach
or
by
the
individual
approach,
and
they
can
be
resolved
either
by
the
policy
that
says
we
need
to
have
more
young
people
in
the
work
force,
or
by
saying
we
need
to
preserve
the
productivity
of
the
older
and
the
more
experienced
persons.
but
congress
can
make
the
judgment
either
way,
and
similarly,
it
can
make
the
judgment
and
say
we're
going
to
take
it
one
step
at
a
time,
and
we're
only
going
to
identify
part
of
the
people
to
whom
our
policy
is
going
to
extend
at
a
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
that's
true,
that
is
correct.
but
it's
consistent
with
the
policy.
that
is
simply
fleshing
in
the
bfoq,
which
in
turn
was
set
by
congress.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
a
good
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
it
does
very
little
if
any
violence
at
all
to
that
concept
which
i
fully
support,
for
this
reason.
it
permits
florida
to
reach
one
judgment
and
wyoming
to
reach
another
with
respect
to
what
is
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification.
all
that
congress
has
done
is
to
say
that
you've
got
to
have
a
more
accurate
measure
for
what
is
the
disability
than
age
itself.
that
you've
got
to
act
on
something
that's
more
solidly
based
than
just
stereotypes
and
hunches.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
don't
know
what
the
eeoc
would
say,
but
i
would
say
that
it's
an
acceptable
procedure.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
agree
with
that.
following
up
on
that
point,
and
the
extent
to
which
congress
can
make
these
judgments,
bill
crump
is
a
citizen
of
wyoming.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
just
kind
of
an
argument
tool.
[laughter]
mr.
crump
is
not
only
a
citizen
of
wyoming;
he
is
also
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
and
the
united
states
has
a
legitimate
interest
which
is
rooted
in
congress's
section
v
14th
amendment
power
to
insure
that
if
he
and
other
like
him
are
to
be
removed
against
their
will
from
the
work
force
for
which
they
have
been
trained,
which
they
know
best,
at
an
age
in
life
which
may
well
represent
the
point
which
may
be
the
peak
of
their
professional
careers,
then
at
the
very
least,
the
state
must
show
that
it
is
acting
on
something
more
solid
than
just
anecdotes
and
stereotypes.
and
that
brings
us
to
the
second
source
of
congress's
authority
to
pass
this
statute,
which
is
section
v.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
don't
know.
all
i
do
know
is
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
vance
versus
bradley,
the
court
is
willing
to
assume
that
since
that
fell
within
their
authority
to
enact,
it
was
proper
for
them
to
make
that
judgment.
in
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach,
congress's
prohibition
against
the
use
of
literacy
tests
was
upheld,
notwithstanding
the
fact
of
this
court's
earlier
holding
that
literacy
tests
themselves
do
not
violate
the
constitution.
the
principle
is
that
while
congress
may
not
define
constitutional
rights,
it
can
pass
legislation
appropriate
for
the
purpose
of
more
effectively
enforcing
constitutional
rights
which
have
been
identified
by
this
court.
this
case
is
identical
to
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach
in
this
respect.
murgia
and
vance
versus
bradley
make
clear
that
the
equal
protection
clause
protects
against
age
discrimination,
and
congress
has
taken
steps
to
enforce
that
general
guarantee.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
simply
an
inference,
justice
rehnquist,
from
the
fact
that
the
court
rejected
age
as
a
suspect
classification,
it
rejected
employment
as
a
fundamental
right,
and
then
went
on
to
find
that
there
was
a
rational
basis,
all
of
which
is
consistent
with
if
the
court
had,
in
fact,
held
that
age
is
not
protected
by
the
equal
protection
clause,
all
of
that
analysis
would
have
been
surplusage.
therefore,
i
say
that
necessarily
the
holding
is
built
on
the
premise
that
age
is
protected
by
the...
or,
is
included
within
the
14th
amendment.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
indeed,
i
do.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
court
did
not
say
in
so
many
words
that
age...
but
if
there
is
any
doubt
on
that,...
and
may
i
add
that
the
dozen
or
so
lower
federal
courts
that
have
considered
the
issue,
the
same
premise
is
built
in...
i
see
no
reason
that
age
should
not
be
protected.
this
court
has
said
that
the
legal
protection
clause
prohibits
all
forms
of
discrimination,
and
indeed,
it
should.
and
certainly,
the
argument
can
be
made
that
there
is
no
crueler
form
of
discrimination
thin
discrimination
based
on
age
precisely
because...
there
comes
a
point
at
which
it
is
rational
as
to
all
people,
but
because
of
that
fact,
it
is
more
easy
to
erect
the
stereotypes
in
the
age
context
than
perhaps
any
other.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
yes.
while
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court,--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
i
think
that
is
squarely
covered
by...
it
may
be
discriminatory
in
the
sense
that
it
draws
classifications
in
the
sense
that
virtually
any
statute
passed
by
any
legislature
is
discriminatory,
but
it
passes
the
rational
basis
test,
and
that's
murgia
and
vance
versus
bradley.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
indeed,
that
argument
can
be
made.
and
the
answer
to
it
is,
as
this
court
has
clarified
on
many
occasions,
that
the
under-inclusiveness
argument
simply
is
a
very
weak
one
in
the
equal
protection
context,
and
that
congress
can
take
it
one
step
at
a
time.
congress
may
conclude,
either
on
the
one
hand
that
its
policies
that
it
wishes
to
enact
are
achieved
by
mandatory
retirement
programs,
or
it
can
make
the
opposite
conclusion.
now,
in
this
case
as
to
some
people
it
has
made
one
of
those
conclusions,
and
as
to
other
people
it
has
made
others.
but
that
does
not
detract
from
the
fact
that
it
has
the
power
to
do
each.
and
the
most
that
can
be
said
is
that
it
has
been
under-inclusive.
there
was
the
proposal
that
was
put
before
congress
in
1978
to
do
the
job
completely,
to
take
care
of
both
federal
and
state
all
in
one
fell
swoop.
because
largely
of
the
overlapping
jurisdiction
and
the
committee
problem,
congress
elected
not
to
do
that
at
that
time.
but
it
has
the
authority
to
do
either,
and
it
also
follows,
in
my
view,
that
it
has
the
authority
to
do
both
simultaneously,
side
by
side.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
experimenting
in
the
sense...
to
the
extent
that
it's
experimenting,
it's
doing
it
both
ways.
it
imposes
on
itself,
on
the
federal
government,
a
more
stringent
requirement
insofar
as
the
age
limitations
are
concerned.
the
cap
is
off
insofar
as
federal
employees
are
concerned.
the
act
prohibits
all
age
discrimination
to
the
federal
government,
and
to
the
states,
there
are
no
exceptions
except
the
exceptions...
well,
the
exceptions
as
to
the
state
are
age
exceptions,
between
the
ages
of
40
and
70.
over
70,
under
40,
the
state
is
subject
only
to
those
strictures
that
are
imposed
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
murgia
case.
the
final
issue
that
i'd
like
to
deal
with
just
briefly
is
the
state's
argument,
and
one
that
the
district
court
followed,
that
the
14th
amendment...
that
congress
cannot
exercise
its
14th
amendment
power
without
saying
so,
and
saying
so
rather
explicitly.
that,
i
submit,
is
an
erroneous
argument
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
we
believe
that
congress
did
intend
to
exercise
its
14th
amendment
powers.
that
is
a
view
that
is
shared
by
the
overwhelming
majority
of
lower
federal
courts.
probably
the
best
observation
is
in
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
in
calumet
that
the
dominant
feature
of
the
legislative
history
was
a
concern
that
embedded
and
inaccurate
stereotypes
were
producing
irrational
employment
decisions.
that
is
the
language
of
equal
protection
for
prohibition
of
discriminatory
conduct
and
not
of
commerce.
but
even
if
we're
wrong
on
that
issue,
the
premise
of
the
state's
argument
is
itself
in
error.
the
constitution
requires
passage
by
two
houses
of
congress
and
signature
by
the
president.
it
also
requires
that
congress
action
be
authorized
by
some
constitutional
provision.
it
does
not
require
that
congress
identify
what
that
provision
is.
that
is
a
judicial
function
and
not
a
legislative
function.
the
function
of
legislative
history
where
it
exists
is
to
ascertain
congressional
intent.
it
is
not
to
determine
whether
congress
knows
as
much
as
this
court
knows
about
constitutional
law.
the
district
court
has,
in
effect,
held
that
if
congress
does
elect
to
provide
legislative
history
for
the
purpose
of
clarifying
substantive
meaning,
which
it
need
not
do
at
all,
the
price
that
congress
pays
for
that
clarification
is
to
put
its
statute
at
constitutional
risk.
this
court's
decision
in
pennhurst
is
not
to
the
contrary;
this
court's
decision
in
pennhurts
properly
read
also
includes
only
an
inquiry
into
congressional
intent
and
not
to
require
that
congress
receive
a
passing
grade
on
its
constitutional
law
exam.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
just
a
couple
of
matters,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
with
regard
to
mr.
salzburg's
final
argument,
it's
exactly
the
same
argument
that
new
york
made
in
morgan.
new
york
in
the
morgan
case
argued
that
its
english
language
requirement
could
not
be
prohibited
by
congress
because
the
constitution
did
not
require
it.
and
that's
exactly...
and
the
significance
of
morgan
is
that
it
gives
congress
the
authority
to
go
beyond
when
all
that
congress
is
doing
is
to
identify
means
of
enforcing
those
constitutional
rights
that
have
been
already
identified
by
this
court.
with
regard
to
eeoc
and...
this
is
one
instance,
justice
rehnquist,
in
which
i
guessed
right
as
to
what
eeoc
would
do...
there
are
opinions,
apparently,
in
both
the
department
of
labor
and
eeoc
that
more
frequent
physical
examinations
for
older
employees
is
not
violative
of
the
adea.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
congress
has,
in
effect,
concluded
that
there
is
a
bfoq
for
law
enforcement,
that
is
not
the
approach.
and
indeed,
if
it
were
it
would
excuse
privately
employed
security
guards
covered
by
the
adea.
rather,
congress's
approach
has
simply
been
to
go
not
as
far
as
it
might.
with
regard
to
the
states,
it
has
not
prohibited
age
discrimination
under
age
40
or
over
age
70,
and
with
regard
to
the
federal
government,
it
has
not
yet
applied
to
all
federal
employees.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
as
i
say,
it
is
an
under-inclusiveness
argument.
finally,
let
me
take
justice
stevens'
question
one
step
further.
congress
reenacts
and
says
that
it's
acting
pursuant
to
the
14th
amendment.
the
same
result
obtains,
i
submit,
if
congress
reenacts
and
says
absolutely
nothing.
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
that
congress
either
provide
legislative
history
or
specify
the
constitutional
basis
for
what
it
has
done.
in
this
case,
the
determinative
fact
is
that
there
is
a
constitutional
basis,
and
congress
exercised
that
constitutional
basis.
whether
it
was
smart
enough
to
know
that
that
is
what
it
was
doing
or
not
is
for
this
court
to
determine.
for
this
reason,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
the
wyoming
should
be
reversed.
