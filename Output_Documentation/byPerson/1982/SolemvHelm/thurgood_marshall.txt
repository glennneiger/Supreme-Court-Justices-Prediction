justice
thurgood
marshall
attorney
general,
you
mentioned
about
this
life
imprisonment
and
parole.
i
understood
this
was
without
parole.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
confused
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
as
i
read
your
statute,
am
i
correct
that
if
somebody
commits
a
felony
and
it's
shown
that
he's
had
three
prior...
i
mean,
four
prior
misdemeanor
convictions
he
can
get
life?
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
this
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
says
convictions.
justice
thurgood
marshall
good.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
changed
my
notes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
waived
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
waived
it.
he
waived
it,
here,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
have
happened
if
in
each
one
of
these
burglaries
he
was
stiff
drunk
and
broke
in
just
to
lay
down
and
go
to
sleep?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
different
from
breaking
in
or
blowing
up
a
safe
and
destroying
a
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
killing
somebody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i'm
saying
it
could
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
nobody
seemed
to
be
interested
in
it.
mr.
attorney
general,
would
that
even
constitute
the
offense
of
burglary?
doesn't
it
have
to
be
breaking
and
entering
with
the
intent
to
commit
a
felony
or
a
theft
therein?
justice
thurgood
marshall
burglary
3
doesn't
include
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
right.
so
he
broke
in
and
he
stole
a
loaf
of
bread.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
it.
life
imprisonment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
only
after
three
loaves
of
bread.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
case
at
one
time
he
was
convicted
of
driving
while
drunk.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
close
to
a
crime
of
violence,
but
by
sheer
accident
it
wasn't
violence.
isn't
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
driving
while
drunk,
using
a
lethal
weapon
in
the
hand
of
a
drunk
is
dangerous.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that's
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
he'd
been
convicted
seven
times
of
drunken
driving.
would
that
entitle
him
to
life
imprisonment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
put
it
this
way.
three
times
with
a
small
car,
four
times
with
a
truck.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
there's
no
intent
to
do
injury,
yet
you
know
what
could
happen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
presumed
to
know
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
presumed
to
know
that
a
drunken
driver
does
not
have
the
same
reflexes
as
a
sober
one.
you
are
presumed
to
know
that
when
you
drive
while
drunk.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
both
are
the
victims
equally
dead?
justice
thurgood
marshall
whether
he
shoots
a
guy
in
a
robbery
or
otherwise
drives
over
him
in
a
truck
while
drunk?
the
dead
person
is
just
as
dead.
