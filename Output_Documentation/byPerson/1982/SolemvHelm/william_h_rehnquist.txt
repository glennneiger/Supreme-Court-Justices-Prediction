justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
really
think
he
was...
do
you
think
he
was
a
prime
candidate
for
rehabilitation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's,
of
course,
the
judgment
that
the
south
dakota
legislature
made,
saying
that
in
these
circumstances
of
multiple
felonies
that
they
would
rule
out
that
possibility.
i
take
it
you
say
that
the
eighth
amendment
forbids
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
burnett,
what
was
the
crime
involved
in
coker?
was
it
rape?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
your
analysis
would
you
say
that
a
state
could
not
sentence
a
person
who
is
found
guilty
of
the
sort
of
rape
that
was
involved
in
coker
to
life
imprisonment
without
the
possibility
of
parole?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what,
then,
is
the
distinction
between
seven
of
this
kind
of
felonies
and
the
rape,
so
far
as
rehabilitation
is
concerned?
supposing
it
was
a
21-year-old
person
convicted
of
rape?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under
your
test,
if
only
two
states
in
fact
impose
that
sort
of
a
punishment,
those
two
would
be
lopped
off
by
your
test.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wasn't
this,
your
whole
approach,
pretty
well
rejected
by
the
court
opinion
in
rummel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
this
breaking
it
down
into
numerous
so-called
objective
factors.
that
was
really
the
approach
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
in
hart
against
coiner,
as
i
recall,
and
i
thought
the
court
opinion
in
rummel
rejected
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
last
felony
were
his
fourth
third-degree
burglary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under...
what
authority
did
the
eighth
circuit
have
to
make
that
sort
of
suggestion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
authority
did
the
eighth
circuit
have
to
make
that
sort
of
suggestion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
it
affects
the
mens
rea
sufficiently,
the
elements
of
the
offense
aren't
made
out,
are
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
presumably
in
each
offense
which
he
was
found
guilty
of
there
was
the
necessary
intent,
whether
or
not
he
might
have
been
drinking.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
i
don't
see
why
it
would
affect
the
mens
rea.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
he
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
the
offense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
if
he
had
been
drinking
and
then
formed
the
intent
to
commit
a
burglary
and
committed
the
burglary,
he
is
less
blameworthy
than
someone
who
hadn't
been
drinking
and
formed
the
intent
to
commit
a
burglary
and
committed
the
burglary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that's
implicit
in
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
distributive
justice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
drunken
driving
involves
any
threat
to
the
person
of
another?
