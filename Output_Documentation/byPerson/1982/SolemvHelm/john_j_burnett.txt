mr.
john
j.
burnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
helm
has
been
deprived
of
his
freedom
for
life
by
the
punishment
involved
in
this
case.
the
state
of
south
dakota
argues
that
this
court
should
not
even
consider
whether
such
an
extremely
harsh
punishment
has
any
relationship
to
the
severity
of
the
crimes
that
mr.
helm
was
convicted
of.
once
a
person
commits
a
felony,
no
matter
what
the
nature
of
that
felony,
according
to
mr.
meierhenry,
then
that
person
forfeits
his
life,
his
liberty--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--your
honor,
he
said
the
felony
and
in
accordance
with
his
brief
and
in
accordance
with,
as
i
understood,
his
argument
to
you--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
the
issue
is
here.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
yes,
your
honor.
of
course,
rummel
v.
estelle,
this
court
did
uphold
the
life
sentence
on
a
texas
recidivist
convicted
of
three
prior
felonies,
but
in
rummel
this
court
refrained
from
applying
the
proportionality
principle
espoused
in
the
cases
of
coker
v.
georgia,
and
weems
v.
united
states.
now
the
reason
this
court
felt
compelled
to
hold
back
from
applying
a
proportionality
analysis
in
that
case
was
because
the
punishments
involved
in
weems
and
coker
could
be
clearly
distinguished,
a
bright
line
could
be
drawn
between
those
punishments
and
traditional
forms
of
imprisonment,
while
no
such
bright
line
could
be
drawn
between
rummel's
punishment
and
traditional
forms
of
imprisonment.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
fear
of
a
more
extensive
intrusion
into
the
line-drawing
process
of
the
legislature,
as
there
was
in
rummel,
because
a
bright
line
can
be
drawn
in
this
case
and
between
traditional
forms
of
imprisonment.
in
rummel,
your
honor,
this
court,
in
distinguishing
his
sentence
from
the
death
penalty
involved
in
coker,
quoted
justice
stewart
in
furman
v.
georgia
to
the
effect
that
the
penalty
of
death
differs
in
kind
from
other
forms
of
punishment.
it
is
unique
in
its
total
irrevocability.
it
is
unique
in
its
rejection
of
rehabilitation
as
a
basic
goal
of
criminal
justice,
and
it
is
unique
in
its
absolute
renunciation
of
all
that
is
embodied
in
our
concept
of
humanity.
now
those
points
brought
out
by
justice
stewart's
opinion,
quoted
in
rummel,
rummel's
sentence
was
distinguishable
from
the
death
penalty
on.
his
eligibility
for
parole
in
12
years
meant
that
his
sentence
was
not
irrevocable
and
his
eligibility
for
parole
in
less
than
12
years
meant
that
his
sentence
did
not
reject
his
rehabilitation
completely.
however,
mr.
helm
is
never
eligible
under
south
dakota
law
for
parole.
consequently,
his
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
means
he
will
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
unless
there
is
the
extremely
unlikely
possibility
that
the
governor
of
south
dakota
or
one
of
the
governors
of
south
dakota,
who
have
not
commuted
a
single
life
sentence
since
1975,
will
somehow
decide
to
commute
his
sentence.
consequently,
his
sentence
approaches
irrevocability
of
the
death
penalty,
since
his
imprisonment
for
life
cannot
even
be
revoked
by
the
possibility
of
parole.
also,
his
sentence
rejects
his
rehabilitation
completely.
i
don't
think
there's
any
way
anybody
could
argue
a
life
sentence
without
parole
is
a
sentence
based
or
considers
rehabilitation
at
all.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
certainly
not
justified
on
the
basis
of
his
record
to
totally
rule
out
the
fact
of
his
rehabilitation.
i
think
right
now--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--your
honor,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
eighth
amendment
requires...
i
think
there
were
two
tests
laid
out
in
coker.
it
requires
that
a
punishment
be
not
grossly
proportionate
to
the
offense
and
that
it
make...
well,
then,
of
course,
a
negligible
contribution
test
also.
my
contention
is,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it's
based
on
decisions
of
this
court,
that
the
proportionality
requirement
of
the
coker
test,
also
mentioned
in
weems
v.
united
states,
the
punishment
must
be
graduated
in
proportion
to
the
offense,
that
that
puts
a
limit
in
accordance
with
the
rehabilitative
rationale
of
punishment
on
the
extent
to
which
the
state
can
use
utilitarian
rationale
in
imposing
a
punishment.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
if
it
had
been
a
sixteenth
felony
conviction?
mr.
john
j.
burnett
i'm
not
sure
what
my
position
would
be
then,
your
honor.
i'm
just
stating
that
it
was
seven
felonies...
i
mean,
it
could
have
been...
when
you
get
to
some
point
i
think
that--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--to
twenty.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
i
don't
know.
i
just
know
that
seven,
life
imprisonment
without
parole
for
seven
would
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
now
twenty,
i
think
it
would...
still
in
that
circumstance
i
would
be
interested
in
knowing
what
the
felony
convictions
were
and
what
the
circumstances
behind
each
of
those
felony
convictions
were
before
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
rule
out
and
reject
completely
rehabilitation
as
a
basic
goal
of
his
punishment.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
fifty
years
without
possibility
of
parole.
again,
i
would
have
to...
i'd
have
a
difficult
time
answering
that
question.
i
think
he
would
then,
under
those
circumstances,
have
a
possibility
of
being
out
before
the
end
of
his
life.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
if
he
were
60
years
old
and
you're
talking
reform,
the
sentence
would
effectively
then
probably
deprive
him
of
his
freedom
for
life.
i
would...
again,
without
knowing
anything
more
about
it,
i
would
say
that
i
would
definitely
have
problems
with
a
sentence
like
that.
i'd
have
to
look
at
it
more,
but
i
could
see
that
it
could
be
analogized
to
this,
then.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
john
j.
burnett
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
if
a
sentence
cannot
be
clear...
if
you
can
clearly
distinguish
a
sentence
from
traditional
sentences
of
imprisonment,
which
a
term
of
year
sentence
normally
is,
then
a
bright
line
could
be
drawn
between
that
sentence
and
the
proportionality
test,
as
applied
in
coker
should
apply.
in
other
words,
rummel
v.
estelle
is
distinguishable
from
that
sentence.
now
what...
i'm
addressing
your
question,
too.
i
think
i
can
imagine
if
you,
like
for
instance
a
sentence
for
a
term
of
years,
for
895
years,
with
no
eligibility
for
parole,
would,
in
my
estimation,
be
a
life
sentence
without
parole,
just
called
a
different
name.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
well,
if
you
could
know
for
sure
what
his
life
expectancy
would
be--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--okay.
well,
you
could
predict
on
the
tables,
but
even
then
what
i'm
stating,
your
honor,
is
that
the
sentence
that
is
designed
to
ensure
that
a
person
is
in
prison
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
that
does
not
consider
his
rehabilitation
completely,
that
rejects
his
rehabilitation
completely,
that
that
sentence
cannot
be
clearly
distinguishable
from
the
death
penalty,
as
was
the
sentence
involved
in
rummel.
and
such
a
sentence
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
traditional
forms
of
imprisonment.
i
don't
think
most
sentences
of
imprisonment,
and
most
traditional
forms
of
imprisonment
are
not
designed
to
keep
someone
in
prison
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
and
i
think
that
is
why
parole
has
achieved
such
a
prominent
role
in
our
system
of
criminal
justice,
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
this
court
in,
for
instance,
morrissey
v.
brewer.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
in
coker
it
was
rape,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
your
honor,
what
i'm
saying
in
this
case
is
that
the
proportionality
principle
applied
in
coker
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
now
that
also,
i
think,
is
mentioned
in
rummel
and
is
also
mentioned
in
coker
in
applying
that
proportionality
principle.
it's
important
that
the
court
be
informed
by
objective
factors
to
the
maximum
extent
possible.
now
there
are
three
objective
factors,
i
think,
that
have
been
identified.
number
one,
the
nature
of
the
offense.
now,
for
instance,
rape,
i
think
would
contrast
quite
sharply
from
any
of
the
offenses
that
helm
was
convicted
of.
in
other
words,
the
first
objective
factor
would
be
considering
the
nature
of
the
offense
in
terms
of
the
harm
caused,
the
harmfulness
of
the
offense,
and
the
mens
rea
with
which
it
was
committed,
comparing
that
with
the
punishment
inflicted.
the
second
objective
factor
is
comparing
the
sentence
imposed
in
that
jurisdiction
with
the
sentences
imposed
in
other
jurisdictions.
and
the
third,
of
course,
is
the
sentence
imposed
on
other
criminals
for
different
crimes
within
the
same
state.
now
i
would
not...
i'd
have
to
subject
the
crime
of
rape.
my
suspicion
right
now
is
that
all
those
objective
factors
would
indicate
that
a
life
sentence
without
parole
would
be
warranted
for
that
particular--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--no,
your
honor.
the
combined...
that's
just
one
of
the
three
objective
factors
that
i'd
use.
there
is
only
one
other
state
where
helm
could
have
been
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
without
parole
for
the
offenses
he
was
convicted
of
in
this
case.
but
again
i
understand
the
concern
with
federalism
in
applying
just
that
interjurisdictional
analysis.
but
it
is
one
objective
factor
that
the
court
can
apply
in
determining
the
question
of
whether
a
punishment
is
proportionate
to
the
offense
committed.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
my
approach
was
rejected
by
the
court--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--your
honor,
the
court
opinion
in
rummel,
i
think,
it
rejected
that
for
one
reason,
and
that
was
that
rummel's
sentence
could
not
be
clearly
separated,
a
bright
line
could
not
be
drawn
between
rummel's
sentence
and
traditional
forms
of
imprisonment.
therefore,
for
the
court
to
say
that
his
punishment
was
unconstitutional
would
involve
the
court
in
the
line-drawing
process,
preeminently
the
province
of
the
legislature.
therefore,
the
court
in
rummel
distinguished
rummel's
sentence
from
the
death
penalty
in
coker.
the
reason
that
this
case
is
different
than
rummel
and
rummel
does
not
apply
to
this
case
is
because
when
you're
talking
about
life
imprisonment
without
parole
you
are
not
talking
about
a
sentence
that's
clearly
distinguishable
from
the
death
penalty.
you're
talking
about
a
sentence
that
approaches
the
irrevocability
of
a
death
sentence.
you're
talking
about
a
sentence
that
rejects
rehabilitation
completely,
as
the
death
penalty
does.
so
for
that
reason
the
court's
fear
in
applying
the
proportionality
analysis
of
intruding
more
extensively
than
was
required
in
weems
and
in
coker
into
the
line-drawing
process
is
not
present
in
this
case.
so
the
reason
that
rummel
did
not
decide
this
case
is
because
that
fear
in
rummel
is
not
present.
now
coker
v.
georgia,
when
it
talked
about
the
objective
factors...
and
i
think
it
was
pointed
out
in
rummel...
that
there
was
a
certain
degree
of
subjectivity
involved
in
at
least
two
of
the
objective
factors
that
were
argued
in
rummel
and
that
are
argued
here...
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
the
interjurisdictional
comparisons.
in
coker
v.
georgia,
this
court
said
to
the
maximum
extent
possible.
also,
in
coker
v.
georgia,
it
was
stated
that
objective
factors
cannot
determine
this
controversy
entirely,
for
the
constitution
contemplates
our
own
judgment
should
be
brought
to
bear.
now
what...
i'm
telling
your
honors
that
interjurisdictional
comparison
does
indicate
by
itself
that
the
sentence
in
this
case
is
unconstitutional,
disproportionate
to
the
punishment
compared
to
every
other
state
in
the
country.
number
two,
analyzing
that
with
the
two
other
objective
factors,
which
also
indicate
that
his
sentence
is
grossly
disproportionate
to
the
punishment,
those
three
objective
factors,
utilizing
them,
do
indicate--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
john
j.
burnett
your
honor,
i
do,
as
the
attorney
general
has
said,
i
have
not
argued
that
the
habitual
offender,
the
enhancement
of
punishment
for
a
prior
offender,
that
that
is
in
and
of
itself
unconstitutional.
what
i
am
pointing
out,
your
honor,
the
reason
that
the
last
felony
is
so
important
is
because
he
has
already
committed
other
crimes.
he's
already
been
punished
for
them.
the
fact
that
he
commits
another
crime
does
indicate,
in
looking
at
the
last
felony,
more
moral
blameworthiness,
which
i
think
is
about
the
best
justification
i've
heard
for
enhanced
penalties
for
an
habitual
offender...
increased
blameworthiness.
and
you
analyze
that
blameworthiness
with
the
harm
involved
and
so
for
that
reason
i
think
the
last
felony
is
more
important
than
the
other
felonies.
for
instance,
if
the
last
felony
was
a
rape
or
an
offense
involving
a
gun
or
some
type
of
threat
of...
violent
offense,
it
would
be
different.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
the
fourth
third-degree
burglary.
i
think
all
the...
excuse
me.
i
think
my
argument
would
be
pretty
much
the
same
as
it
is
here
today.
in
south
dakota,
entering
structures
with
the
intent
to
commit
a
crime
is
burglary.
i
think
all
the
prior
burglaries
that
mr.
helm
was
involved
in,
although
this
doesn't
appear
in
the
record,
i
think
they
were
all
breaking
into
liquor
stores.
but
again
the
only
thing
the
judge
knew
at
the
time
of
imposing
the
sentence
on
mr.
helm
was
this.
the
last
offense
he
was
convicted
on
was
a
$100
no-account
check
charge.
the
judge
asked
him
to
explain
what
happened.
he
needs
a
factual
base
for
the
plea.
mr.
helm
explains
he
was
working
in
sioux
falls.
he
got
paid
that
day,
ended
up
in
rapid
city
with
more
money
than
he
started
out
with.
he
knew
he
must
have
done
something
wrong.
he
didn't
remember
exactly
what.
he
had
stopped
several
places.
he
was
drinking.
if
he
would
have
known
about
the
check,
he
would
have
paid
it.
the
judge
also,
the
only
thing
he
knew
about
the
prior
felonies
at
the
time
of
his
sentencing
was
that
they
were
all
a
product
of
mr.
helm's
alcoholism.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
no,
your
honor,
it's
not.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
he
did,
your
honor.
i
think
the
eighth
circuit,
in
their
opinion
in
this
case,
although
knowing
the
fact
that
he
had
waived
his
right
to
a
pre-sentence
investigation,
suggested
that
one
be
done
in
this
case
and
i
certainly
think--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--what?
mr.
john
j.
burnett
no
authority,
your
honor.
it
was
just
a
suggestion
that
they
made
in
the
case
in
a
footnote,
i
believe.
there
is
no
authority.
no
case
is
cited,
nothing
like
that.
it
was
just...
i
think
it
was
their
feeling
that
in
imposing
such
a
drastic
sentence,
life
in
prison
without
parole,
on
the
minimal
knowledge
that
the
judge
had
about
the
offender,
and
imposing
a
punishment
that
completely
rejected
his
rehabilitation,
that
certain...
more
things
should
be
known
about
him
in
determining
the
punishment
that
should
be
imposed
upon
him.
now,
as
i
mentioned,
the
first
objective
factor
is
the
nature
of
the
offenses.
now
it's
pointed
out
that
the
prior
felonies
of
mr.
helm
in
this
case
were,
as
i
think
the
court's
already
been
informed,
three
third-degree
burglaries,
one
grand
theft,
one
obtaining
money
under
false
pretenses,
and
one
third
offense
driving
while
intoxicated,
and
then
the
$100
no-account
check.
none
of
those
offenses
involve
violence.
i
know
that
this
court
pointed
out
in
rummel
v.
estelle
that
distinguishing
between
violent
and
non-violent
crimes
involves
a
subjective
judgment
more
eminently
the
problem
of
the
legislature.
one
thing
i
could
inform
the
court
of
is
that
there
have
been
surveys
taken
of
the
general
population.
one
that
i
know
was
completed
after
rummel
was
decided...
i
think
28
wayne
law
journal
number
3...
indicated
that
the
population
as
a
whole
in
this
country
does
draw
a
bright
line
between
violent
and
non-violent
crimes.
when
that
is
combined
with
the
fact
of
mr.
helm's
alcoholism
and
you
consider
the
harm
involved
in
his
offenses
with
the
mens
rea
that
they
were
committed,
i
think...
and
i
would
submit
that
alcoholism
does
affect
the
mens
rea
with
which
an
offense
is
committed--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--no,
they're
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
um-hum.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
i'm
just
saying
in
terms
of
punishment,
your
honor.
alcoholism
could
affect
the
mens
rea
to
the
extent
that
it
would
totally
obliterate
mens
rea,
therefore
affecting
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
no,
he
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
the
offense
in
that
case.
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
even
if
it
does
not
affect
his
mens
rea
to
the
extent
to
totally
obliterate
it,
that
still
is
a
factor
to
be
considered
in
assessing
his
moral
blameworthiness
for
the
commission
of
the
act.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
in
general,
yes,
your
honor,
because
of--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--i
don't
think
it...
i
think
it's
implicit
in
the
eighth
amendment
to
the
extent...
and
this
is
going
to
be
rather
involved...
but
it's
implicit
in
the
eighth
amendment
to
this
extent,
that
the
eighth
amendment
prohibits
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
that
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
require
that
the
punishment
be
graduated
in
proportion
to
the
offense.
that
that
proportionality
requirement
requires
distributive
justice.
that
distributive
justice--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--it
means
that
a
person
should
be
treated
as
an
individual,
that
justice
should
be
gauged...
his
sentence
should
be
gauged
to
his
personal
culpability,
his
personal
blameworthiness
for
the
offense
that
he
did
and
the
actual
harm
that
was
caused.
in
other
words,
i
think,
for
instance,
in
robinson
v.
california
the
state
may
be
threatened
a
lot
by
drug
addicts,
but
distributive
justice
requires
that
they
cannot
be
treated
as
criminals
unless
they
have
done
something
voluntary.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
well,
if
you're
talking
about
a
car
accident,
it
was
a
sheer
accident
that
wasn't--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
trying
to
argue
that--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--well,
again,
your
honor,
i
think
when
you
look
at--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--well,
i
don't...
i'd
still
argue
that
i
would
have,
i
think,
that
there
would
still
be
problems
under
the
eighth
amendment
in
imposing
a
life
sentence
without
parole
for
those.
i'd
have
to
know
a
lot
more
than
just
that,
but
i
think
that
driving
while
intoxicated,
although
it
was
true
the
danger
of
the
offense,
i
think
there's
no
intent
there
to
cause
anybody
any
injury.
and
that,
i
think,
would
be
something
that
should
be
considered
in
determining
what
punishment
should
be
imposed
for
that
offense.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
well,
your
honor--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--your
honor,
i
just--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--yes,
your
honor.
it's
just...
the
only
thing
i'm
saying
is
this,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
i
could...
i
don't
think
it
could
quite
be
compared,
the
mens
rea
of
a
person
driving
a
car
while
intoxicated
with
the
mens
rea
of
a
person
that,
like,
for
instance,
takes
a
gun
into
a
store,
give
me
all
your
money
or
i'll
shoot
you.
i
think
that
you're
talking
about
a
more
guilty
frame
of
mind.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
yes--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--that's
certainly
true,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
that's
about
what
i
was
going
to
say.
i
couldn't...
i
can't
really
recall
right
off
the
top
of
my
head,
but--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--he's
40
today,
because
i
think
he
was
sentenced
when
he
was
36,
which
would
have
been
'79,
so
he's
40,
i
think,
at
this
date.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
then,
finally,
the
last
objective
factor
that
i
mentioned,
interjurisdictional
approach,
south
dakota...
the
only
people
in
south
dakota
that
could
be...
receive
a
life
sentence
without
parole,
as
mr.
helm
did,
would
be
someone
convicted
of
murder,
first-degree
manslaughter,
first-degree
arson
or
kidnapping.
all
the
offenses,
then,
for
which
a
person
can
receive
life
imprisonment
outside
of
the
one
mr.
helm
was
convicted
of,
involve
violence
or
the
threat
of
violence
or
death
to
another
person.
mr.
helm,
on
the
other
hand,
has
never
in
his
life
committed
any
offense
involving
violence
or
the
threat
of
violence
or
any
injury
to
the
person
of
another.
mr.
john
j.
burnett
well,
your
honor,
it
would
if
there
was
an
accident
involved.
to
that
extent,
any
time
you
drive
while
intoxicated
there
would
be
a
threat
of
injury
to
another
person.
but
to
the
extent
that
you
commit
an
offense
where
you,
for
instance,
in
robbery
where
you
threaten
violence
in
order
to
obtain
money,
that
certainly
doesn't
apply
to
a
third
offense
dwi.
so
for
that
reason
i
do
not
count
third
offense
dwi
as
an
offense
involving
injury
to
the
person
of
another
or
the
threat
of
violence
or
a
violent
offense,
for
that
matter.
when
an
accident
happened,
i
would
certainly
have
to
agree
that
there
was
violence
involved.
so
comparison
of
the
laws
of
the
state
of
south
dakota
and
how
south
dakota
treats
other
criminals
also
indicates
that
the
punishment
in
this
case
is
excessive
compared
to
the
offense.
every
one
of
these
objective
factors,
considered
separately...
the
nature
of
the
offense
in
terms
of
the
harm
involved
and
the
mens
rea
with
which
it
was
committed,
compared
to
the
punishment,
the
first
objective
factor,
to
the
interjurisdictional
comparison,
the
fact
that
nevada
is
the
only
state
out
of
south
dakota...
outside
of
south
dakota
in
this
whole
country
where
mr.
helm
could
have
received
a
sentence
of
life
without
parole
for
the
offenses
he
was
convicted
of,
and
thirdly,
the
fact
that
south
dakota
punishes
only
people,
outside
of
mr.
helm,
convicted
of
violent
crimes
or
crimes
involving
violence,
or
injury
to
a
person
of
another...
all
of
these
objective
factors,
considered
separately,
indicate
that
mr.
helm's
sentence
in
this
case
is
grossly
disproportionate
to
his
punishment.
when
all
three
objective
factors
are
considered
together,
it
should
compel
the
conclusion,
in
this
case,
that
his
sentence
is
grossly
disproportionate
to
his
punishment.
the
eighth
circuit
in
this--
mr.
john
j.
burnett
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
believe
i'm
done.
thank
you.
