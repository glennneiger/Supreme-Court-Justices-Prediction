--general,
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
eighth
circuit
said
that
only
one
other
state
had
laws
that
would
enable
or
authorize
a
life
sentence
without
parole
for
the
type
of
recidivist
that
we
have
in
this
case.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
hereon
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
under
south
dakota's
habitual
offender
law,
respondent
helm
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole.
this
sentence
was
occasioned
by
his
issuing
a
$100
check
without
an
account.
this
is
a
felony
in
south
dakota
and
was
helm's
seventh
offense.
over
a
period
of
15
years,
all
classified
as
felonies
under
state
law.
the
other
six
offenses
also
were
nonviolent.
they
included
third-degree
burglaries
obtaining
money
under
false
pretenses,
a
larceny
as
defined
by
the
state
and
drunk
driving.
respondent
was
36-year-old
at
the
time
of
his
sentencing.
he
was
not
a
professional
criminal.
he
is
addicted
to
alcohol
with
consequent
difficulty
in
obtaining
employment
and
retaining
it.
after
exhausting
state
remedies,
helm
sought
habeas
corpus
relief
in
federal
court
contending
that
his
sentence
constituted
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
under
the
eighth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
agreed
and
granted
the
writ.
now,
prior
cases
established
that
the
eighth
amendment
prohibits
disproportionate
sentences,
as
well
as
punishment
that
is
inherently
barbaric.
in
determining
disproportionality,
we
examine
a
number
of
objective
factors.
these
factors
are
set
forth
in
the
opinion
we
file
today.
on
the
basis
of
these
factors,
we
find
that
respondent's
sentence
to
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole
is
grossly
disproportionate
to
his
crimes.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
our
opinion
makes
clear
however
that
invalidating
an
imprisonment
sentence
imposed
under
state
law
is
action
reserved
only
for
the
most
exceptional
cases.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
white,
rehnquist
and
o'connor
joined.
