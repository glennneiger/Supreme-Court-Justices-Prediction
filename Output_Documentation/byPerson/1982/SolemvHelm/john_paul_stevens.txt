paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
there
a
difference
in
the
parole
situation?
it's
really
routinely
given
to
a
very
significant
number
of
people,
whereas
here
nobody's
gotten
it
for
the
last
ten
or
12
years,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
correct
nobody's
gotten
it
since
1975?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
there
have
been
people
who
have
been
put
on
parole
in
south
dakota
since
1975.
justice
john
paul
stevens
probably
quite
a
lot
of
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you...
because
i
had
not
found
it
in
the
record,
at
the
beginning
you
recited
the
convictions.
could
you
tell
me
again
what
were
they?
in
'64
it
was
a
burglary,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
this
$100
check
item.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
it's
correct
that
from
1973
on,
he
had
one
conviction
for
drunken
driving,
which
probably
had
meant
there
were
a
couple
others
before,
because
it
was
a
felony,
and
the
$100
check.
in
ten
years
he
had
those
two
convictions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
a
dollar
value
on
the
burglary
in
the
third
degree,
or
was
it
just
any
entry?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
make
the
same
argument
if
in
each
of
the
three
burglaries
he
stole
a
quart
of
liquor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
how
frequent...
i
take
it
there
was
no
pre-sentence
report
here
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
customary
in
your
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
his
batting
average?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
'75
when
he
went
in
for
drunken
driving,
how
long
was
he
sentenced
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
nine
months.
so
then
he
was
out
about
four
years
before
he
resumed
his
ill
ways.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
wasn't
it
rather
promptly...
the
charge
promptly
disposed
of
in
'79?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when
did
the
$100
forgery
occur?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
was
out
from
'75...
from
late
in
'75,
early
'76,
until
'79
without
resuming
his
evil
ways.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
say
he
engaged
in
any
misconduct
for
that
three-year
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
presumption
should
we
make
during
that
three-year
period...
that
he
was
out
committing
a
lot
of
crimes,
or
that
he
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
factual
question?
how
old
was
this
man
at
the
time
of
his
first
offense?
there's
some
reference
to
his
age,
but
i
can't
quite
sort
it
out.
i
think
twenty-one
by
the
mathematics
of
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
reference
to
his
having
been
35
or
36
years
old,
but
i
didn't
know
whether
that
was
today
or
at
the
time
of
the
last
conviction
or
what.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
