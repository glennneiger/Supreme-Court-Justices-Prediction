chief

e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
solem
against
helm.
mr.
attorney
general,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
burnett.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
didn't
say
one.
it's
seven.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
issue
here
is
whether
seven
felonies
can
invoke
this
statute
without
offending
the
eighth
amendment,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you'll
have
to
do
is
tell
us
why
the
rummel
case
doesn't
control,
don't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
this
had
been
his
fourteenth
conviction
instead
of
his
seventh
felony
conviction.
what
would
your
view
be
of
it
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
move
it
up
to
twenty
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
twenty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
each
case
your
argument
seems
to
treat
the
offense
as
simply
the
seventh
felony.
that's
your
view,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
just
the
seventh
felony,
but
his
offense
in
the
view,
in
the
eyes
of
the
legislature
of
south
dakota,
his
offense
is
a
continuing
life
of
criminal
conduct
that
endangers
the
safety
and
the
peaceful
life
of
the
people
of
south
dakota.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
a
general
practice
to
omit
or
to
waive
the
pre-sentence
reports?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
not
be
particularly
important
to
have
a
pre-sentence
report
on
a
seventh
felony
conviction
with
the
invocation
of
the
habitual
criminal
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
waived
it
here,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
at
1:00.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
solem
against
helm
will
be
announced
by
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
justice
powell.
