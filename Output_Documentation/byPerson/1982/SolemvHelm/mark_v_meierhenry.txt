mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
case
from
the
eighth
circuit
that
basically
began
three
years
ago.
three
years
ago,
a
man
by
the
name
of
jerry
helm
appeared
before
a
circuit
court
judge
within
the
state
of
south
dakota
and
pled
guilty
to
a
felony.
that
felony
happened
to
be
his
seventh
felony
within
15
years.
judge
parker
in
that
case,
and
the
state
of
south
dakota
had
filed
prior
to
that
time
its
habitual
criminal
statute
and
the
defendant
pled
guilty
to
be
a
habitual
criminal
and
he
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
the
state
of
south
dakota
contends
that
two
recent
decisions
of
this
court
take
care
of
this
situation
and
have
affirmatively
stated
that
this
is
a
permissible
sentence.
those
two
cases,
hutto
versus
davis
and
rummel
versus
estelle,
in
our
opinion
were
ignored
by
the
eighth
circuit.
the
eighth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
within
south
dakota
after
it
had
upheld
the
state
of
south
dakota
supreme
court's
decision,
which
decided
this
was
a
permissible
sentence
and
it
did
not
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
the
state
of
south
dakota
petitioned
for
writ
of
certiorari,
was
granted.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
a
statutorily-authorized
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
without
parole
but
with
the
right
of
commutation
for
a
non-violent
habitual
offender's
seventh
felony
constitutes
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
under
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
mr.
helm
has
been
an
active
criminal.
he
is
certainly
an
habitual
criminal.
he
has
been
convicted
three
times
of
burglary...
in
1964,
'66,
and
'69;
of
obtaining
money
under
false
pretenses
in
'72;
of
grand
larceny
in
'73;
a
third
offense,
driving
while
intoxicated,
which
requires
three
offenses
within
four
years,
by
the
way,
in
1975.
the
basic
crime
for
which
this
case
rests
on
was
writing
a
no-account
check,
which
is
a
felony
in
south
dakota,
as
in
most
other
states,
and
it
was
for
the
amount
of
$100.
south
dakota's
habitual
offender
statute,
we
have
two.
one
is
for
the
first
and
second
felony.
it
allows
a
circuit
court
judge
to
basically
double
whatever
the
statutory
sentence
is.
when
an
individual
commits
their
fourth
sentence,
our
court
or
our
circuit
court
can
sentence
an
individual
anywhere
from
one
day
to
life.
in
this
particular
case
he
was
given
life
imprisonment
and,
as
is
pointed
out
in
the
briefs,
in
south
dakota
life
imprisonment
requires
that
the
governor
commute
that
to
a
term
of
years
prior
to
the
time
that
parole
begins.
we
submit
that
this
court
has
decided
this
case
in
rummel
versus
estelle.
it
is
just
like
the
state
of
texas,
only
in
effect
a
mirror
image.
in
texas,
the
parole
board
allows
a
parole,
it
must
be
approved
by
the
governor.
ours
is
the
other
way
around,
that
the
governor
must
first
commute
it
to
a
term
of
years,
then
assigns
it
to
the
parole
board.
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
the
state
of
south
dakota
is
more
lenient
than
texas.
texas
requires,
the
legislature
requires,
a
mandatory
life
sentence.
here
it
is
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
sentencing
judge.
these
two
cases...
i
might
point
out
that
in
this
case,
as
in
the
rummel
case,
the
defendant
does
not
challenge
the
habitual
criminal
statute
of
south
dakota,
nor
does
he
contend
that
that
statute
is
unfairly
or
unconstitutionally
applied
as
to
his
client.
he
simply
states
that
this
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
the
eighth
circuit,
at
the
oral
argument,
noted
that
this
life
sentence
for
this
individual
on
his
seventh
felony
within
15
years
was
a
black
day
in
legal
jurisprudence
and
that
it
was...
it
eventually
held
that
it
was
cruel
and
unusual.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that's
correct.
the...
but
under...
in
the
state
of
south
dakota,
and
i
think
the
appendix
to
the
brief
shows
that,
about
50
percent
of
the
time
those
people
who
get
life
sentences
are
paroled,
or
at
least
over
the
period
that
the
eighth
circuit
asked
for
the
information.
the
process
in
south
dakota,
and
i
think
you
can
see
that
in
the
lower
judges'
statements
to
the
defendant,
that
an
individual--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
an
individual
can
be
commuted
and
in
south
dakota
that's
the
normal
process.
for
example,
in
texas
they
have
a
little
different
procedure.
there
the
board
of
pardons
and
paroles
acts.
then
the
governor
must
approve
their
actions.
in
our
state,
if
someone
gets
a
life
sentence
there
is
a
series
of
requests
for
commutation.
if
the
individual
is
a
man
like
mr.
helm,
maybe
eventually
the
governor
will
be
convinced
he's
rehabilitated
himself
in
prison,
will
commute
his
sentence.
once
it's
commuted
to
a
term
of
years,
it
then
is
just
like
any
other
individual
in
the
state
penitentiary.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that's
correct,
your
honor.
once
the
governor
commutes
it
to
a
term
of
years,
whether
it's
ten
years
or
40
years--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
anything
that's
a
class
1
felony
in
south
dakota,
which
would
include
murder,
rape...
the
more
serious
offenses,
your
honor.
and,
of
course,
this
habitual
offender
becomes
a
class
1
felony.
for
example,
if,
like
in
hutto
versus
davis,
the
judge
would
have
given
mr.
helm
40
years,
under
the
rules
of
south
dakota,
he
would
have,
before
he's
eligible
for
parole,
would
have
to
serve
30
years.
in
other
words,
he
would
have
gotten
out
of
prison
when
he
was
66,
70
years
old,
assuming
that
he
had
done
things
properly.
so
it's
our
view
or
the
state
of
south
dakota's
view
that
this
court
has
already
decided
this
factual
situation.
it's
determined
that
there's
a
difference
between
the
death
penalty
and
any
term
of
years,
and
in
this
case
a
life
sentence
is
simply
a
term
of
years
measured
by
an
individual's
life.
this
court
also
discussed,
and
other
courts
have
discussed,
the
possibility
of
parole.
you
have
it
in
this
case,
only
it's
not
called
parole.
it's
called
commutation.
in
both
instances
it
is
executive
leniency.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
i
think
the
record
would
show
since
1975,
and
i
think--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that's
correct.
but
over
the
period
of
time--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--there
have.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
there
have.
the
average
stay
in
our
south
dakota
penitentiary
is
about
2-1/2
years.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
sir.
i'll
repeat
them.
there
were
three
burglary
convictions...
1964,
1966,
1969.
in
1972,
while
out
for
a
short
period
of
time
he
was
convicted
of
obtaining
money
under
false
pretenses.
again,
he
was
out
of
prison
in
1973,
grand
larceny.
1975,
third
offense,
driving
while
intoxicated,
which
in
south
dakota
requires
three
convictions
for
driving
while
intoxicated
within
a
four-year
period.
he's
actually
got
more
than
that.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
and
then
the
$100
no-account
check
in
1979.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
from
'73
to
'79...
he's
been
in
prison,
justice,
since
'79,
so
in
that
six-year
period
he
was
convicted
of
three
felonies,
and
you
must
remember
that
he
was
in
prison
during
part
of
that
time.
i
calculated
he
commits
a
serious
misdemeanor
or
felony
every
5.3
months
he's
out
of
prison,
so
he's
a
rather
active
and,
i
think,
the
perfect
habitual
criminal
example.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
he
can't.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
he
can't.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
know
it,
and
that
was
changed
in
'82.
i
think
it's
one
of
those
things
under
state
law--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that
everybody
assumed
we...
that
it
was
meant
by
a
felony
conviction,
but
that
was
changed.
no
individual...
it
has
to
be
a
felony
in
south
dakota.
it's
always
been
that
way.
in
1982
they
did
amend
our
statute,
which
was
not
published
in
time
for
this.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
okay.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
they
were.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
the
record's
not
real
clear,
but
i
believe
they
were
just
third-degree
burglaries.
that's
the
information
that
was
within
the
record
that
the
circuit
court
judge--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--it's
breaking...
in
south
dakota
it's
breaking
and
entering
into
a
building
that's
not
inhabited.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
unoccupied.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
could
be
a
liquor
store.
it
could
be
a
grocery
store.
it
could
be
a
filling
station.
it
could
be
a
stable.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
by
its
definition
there
was
breakings,
but
not
to
a
human
being,
no,
sir.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that's
a...
taking
property
over
$200.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
over
$200.
let's
see,
in
1973...
my
memory's
not
precise...
it
might
have
still
been
$100.
at
some
point
in
the
'70s--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
it
is
now
$200,
but
in
1973
it
could
have
been
$50.
i'm
not
precise,
but
we
had
to
account
for
inflation,
i
guess,
and
so
during
the
'70s
it
did
go
up.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no.
and
i
don't
think
that...
i
guess
the
state
of
south
dakota...
but
the
dollar
value,
this
court's
already
held
that
in
texas
we
could
look
at
$280.
but
i
don't
think
the
amount
of
the
crime
is
important.
i
don't
think
it's
a
serious
argument
made--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--yes.
it's
the
crime.
as
least
in
south
dakota,
determined
by
the
legislature,
a
burglary
is
a
felony
and
it
is
such
in
most
every
state
in
the
union,
as
far
as
i
know,
and
here
is
an
individual
that
on
six
occasions,
although
our
legislature
said
three
strikes,
he
got
six
strikes,
and
i
think
the
fact
that
there
was
no
violence
involved
allowed
and
permitted
the
executive
branch
not
to
file
an
habitual
criminal
enhancement
against
him
on
his
fourth
felony,
his
fifth
felony
and
his
sixth
felony.
it
wasn't
until
the
seventh
felony
that
a
prosecutor
finally
said,
enough.
i
have
a
duty
to
protect
the
public.
i
have
a
duty
to
take
an
unrepentant
thief
off
of
the
streets
and
keep
him
away.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
it
was
the--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--it
is
not
customary.
it
is
only
when
on
each
and
every
occasion
you
have
a
right
to
one
as
a
defendant.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
he
waived
it.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
he
did.
and,
of
course,
being
an
old
defense
lawyer
myself,
that's
sometimes
the
wisest
thing
to
do
if
you
have
a
client
like
mr.
helm,
is
just
not
tell
the
court
the
least
amount
possible
because
in
this
case,
were
he
to
have
a
pre-sentence,
our
record
only
goes
back
15
years,
so
i
can't
argue
to
you
what
occurred
before
that.
but
this
gentleman's
only
36
years
old
and
so
let's
just
go
back
the
15
years.
out
of
that
period
of
time,
he
was
in
prison
on
various
occasions
a
couple...
17
months
here
and
24
months
here.
i
think
the
court,
from
the
record
before
it,
was
very
justified
in
assuming
that
this
man
was
not
going
to
be
rehabilitated.
the
eighth
circuit--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
doubt
if--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
the
record--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--it's
certainly
different
than
killing
somebody.
i
don't
think
we
can
make
any
quarrel
about
that.
but
as
far
as
him
breaking
in
and
going
to
sleep,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
could
have
been,
but
it
wasn't,
or
we
don't
know.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
does.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
does
in
our
state.
that
would
simply
be
what
we
would
call
a
misdemeanor
trespass
punishable
up
to
a
year.
but
i
guess--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--yes.
you
have
to
have
intent
to
commit
a
crime...
a
crime.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
a
crime.
stealing
a
bottle
of
whiskey
is
a
misdemeanor
in
south
dakota.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
um-hum.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
only
after
there's
three
prior
felonies.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
this
way.
of
course,
there
is
some
individual
who
lost
three
loaves
of
bread
and
under
our
definition
in
south
dakota,
which
is
a
small
state,
we
know
that
individuals
like
mr.
helm,
who
have
had
six
cracks
at
the
penitentiary...
six
times
they've
gone
in
there.
they've
been...
gone
through
the
fish
tank,
as
it's
called,
and
they
get
their
hair
cut
and
they
go
through
each
step,
and
on
six
occasions
that
didn't
seem
to
impede
him
at
all.
under
the
laws
in
south
dakota,
we
protect
people
first
and
property
second,
and
it's
clear
that
there
is
no
logical
way
to
protect
the
people
of
south
dakota,
the
innocent
people
of
south
dakota,
from
jerry
helm.
the
minute
he
gets
out,
and
if
we
let
him
out...
i
figured
it
out...
with
his
life
span,
he's
only
got
37
more
felonies
to
go.
and
i
think
that
we
have
a
duty
to
protect
the
public
from
these
37
more
felonies,
if
he
keeps
his
batting
average
until
the
end.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
know
what
he
served.
his
sentence
would
not
exceed
three
years,
and
he
served
nine
months
and,
i
believe,
17
days
on
that
sentence.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
until
he
was
convicted.
the
state
obviously--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
occurred
three
years
ago,
march
of
'79.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
he
was
not
convicted
during
that
time.
what
he
did--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that's
right,
but
i
don't
think
i
can
naively
say
he
did
not
commit
any
crimes.
he
was
not
convicted
of
any
crimes
until
1979.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no.
i
don't
think
we
can
make
any
presumption.
he
was
not
charged
with
any
criminal
activity
during
that
period
of
time
that
was
relevant
to
this
charge.
if
it
was
a
misdemeanor,
it's
not
relevant
because
only
felonies
are
relevant.
we
believe
that
the
test
that
the
majority
adopted
in
rummel
should
be
used
here.
this
felony
is
classified
as
a
felony,
and
it
is
classifiable
as
a
felony,
and
the
term
and
the
punishment
of
years,
as
the
court
said
or
the
majority
said
there,
the
length
of
the
sentence
is
a
matter
of
legislative
prerogative.
in
this
case
there
are
many
instances
where
mr.
helm
has
the
opportunity
before
we
need
federal
court
intervention.
the
governor
can
commute
him,
which
is
a
possibility.
before
he
even
started
on
this
trail,
a
prosecutor
had
to
make
a
decision
to
charge
him
with
an
habitual
offender
offense.
a
circuit
court
judge
in
our
state
had
to
decide
that
this
man
could
only,
and
society
could
only
be
protected
by
this
punishment.
the
state
of
south
dakota
supreme
court
held
three-to-two...
it
was
a
close
question
there...
that
this
was
appropriate
for
mr.
helm.
and
i
think
in
each
case,
for
example,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
south
dakota,
understands
and
is
aware
that
50
percent
of
the
time
people
who
get
life
imprisonment
in
south
dakota,
or
approximately
50
percent,
are
commuted
by
the
governor.
ours
is
not
a
state
known
for
long
sentences.
ours
is
not
a
state
that
executive
clemency
is
never
used.
in
texas
it
was
denied,
according
to
the
report
i
read,
79
percent
of
the
time.
that's
certainly
not
the
indication
in
south
dakota,
and
yet
this
court
has
held
prior
to
this
time
it
was
acceptable.
we
would
simply
ask
that
this
court
follow,
as
we
clearly
read
rummel
and
as
later
the
per
curiam
in
hutto
versus
davis
held,
that
this
is
a
felony,
that
it
is
up
to
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
south
dakota
to
determine
what
is
a
proper
punishment.
there
is
no
allegation
whatsoever
that
this
man
in
any
way
will
be
treated
cruelly
or
unusually
in
our
state
penitentiary.
he'll
be
cared
for
properly.
he'll
be
fed
properly.
so
it's
only
a
matter
of
years,
and
certainly
if
in
hutto
versus
davis
40
years
for
nine
ounces
of
marijuana
is
acceptable,
in
this
instance,
after
six
felonies
and
on
the
seventh
felony,
and
only
then,
that
this
individual
be
given
the
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
in
south
dakota.
we
think
that
any
other
decision
would
be
a
subjective
decision
and
that
the
legislature
of
south
dakota
has
appropriately
made
this
decision,
as
did
the
circuit
court
of
south
dakota,
as
did
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota,
to
protect
us
from
thieves.
i
don't
think
we
want
violent
people
in
our
society.
we
don't.
on
the
other
hand,
our
society
won't
survive
very
well
if
we
have
500
people
like
jerry
helm
in
a
state
of
our
size,
of
700,000.
one
can
cause
a
lot
of
damage
and
i
think
that
jerry
helm
is
where
he
should
be.
i
don't
think
he
was
treated
unfairly
or
too
cruelly.
if
you
can't
learn
in
six
times,
seven
times,
in
our
society,
i
don't
know
that
the
populace
of
this
country
want
to
put
up
with
these
individuals.
if
he
reforms,
and
i'm
sure
he
went
through
aa
every
time
he
was
in
prison,
i'm
sure
he
went
to
church
every
time
he
was
in
prison
and
joined
the
jaycees
every
time
he
was
in
prison,
and
was
reformed,
and
i'm
sure
he'll
get
out
again.
but
we
need
not
under
the
eighth
amendment
declare
it
cruel
and
unusual
to
have
a
man
who
is
certainly
unusual
in
and
of
himself...
seven
felony
convictions
within
15
years
and
only
36
or
37
years
old.
thank
you.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
think
they
mentioned
nevada
and
i
believe
there's
one
other
that
skips
my
mind.
but
there
are
not
a
great
deal.
but
i
think
so
many
of
these
things
are
without
a
difference
because
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
south
dakota
and
texas.
actually,
i
think
texas
has
tougher
habitual
criminal
statutes
than
we
do.
number
one,
we
add
a
felony.
number
two,
we've
got
the
court's
discretion,
the
lower
court
discretion.
in
texas,
third
one,
automatic.
yes,
you
have
parole
on
the
other
side.
we
have
commutation
of
sentence.
but
nevada
is
similar
to
us,
to
south
dakota.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
just
a
brief
rebuttal,
your
honors.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
appendix,
specifically
page
22.
i
think
by
reviewing
the
appendix,
wherein
the
45
individuals
who
are
serving
life
for
all
sorts
of
crimes
in
south
dakota
are
listed,
you
will
see
that
this
idea
that
was
mentioned
in
my
colleague's
argument
that
south
dakota
is
overly
harsh
is
just
not
the
case.
we
only
have
three
individuals
in
our
entire
penitentiary
who
have
been
there
over
23
years,
so
i
think
that...
that
it's
fairly
clear
that
most
people,
even
if
they
murder,
maim
and
rape
people,
do
not
spend
all
of
their
natural
lives
in
the
south
dakota
penitentiary.
additionally,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
from
the
record
that
in
1975
this
man
helm
was
convicted
of
driving
while
intoxicated,
third
offense,
which
means
three
within
four
years.
subsequently
to
that
he's
been
convicted
of
two
more
during
this
interim
from
1975
until
1979.
it
shows
the
type
of
man
that
the
circuit
court
judge
was
faced
with,
one
who
was
an
absolutely
unrepentant
thief
who
will
absolutely
not
follow
the
rules
of
society.
at
some
point
society
must
preserve
one
thing,
the
right
to
protect
itself,
and
that
was
done
in
this
case
and
i
believe
nothing
in
the
eighth
amendment
prohibits
it,
nor
would
the
founders
of
our
country
ever
believe
that
we
could
not
protect
ourselves
from
habitual
offenders.
thank
you
very
much.
