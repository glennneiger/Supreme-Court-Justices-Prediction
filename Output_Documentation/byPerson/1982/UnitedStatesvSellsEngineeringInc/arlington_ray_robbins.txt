mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
and
say
something
i
was
not
going
to
say
till
later,
but
i
want
to
get
something
very
much
in
focus.
we
are
talking
here
about
a
vestige
of
the
power
of
the
absolute
monarch,
one
of
the
few
that
remains
in
this
country.
we
are
talking
here
about
the
ex
parte
subpoena
power
of
the
grand
jury
that
can
make
you
come
forthwith
and
answer
anything
that
they
depend
to
ask
on
you
about
any
nook
and
cranny
they
wish
to
explore
without
any
protection--
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
--no,
not
subject
to
the
fourth
and
not
subject
to
the
fifth
and
not
subject
to
invasion
of
privacy,
your
honor.
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
it
has
got
to
be
defined
very
narrowly,
very
precisely.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
not
really,
because
they
can
give
you
immunity,
either
use
or
transaction,
and
make
you
answer.
now,
that
is
a
different
question.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
i
am
sorry.
let
me
clarify
it.
you
cannot
be
convicted
by
the
testimony
you
would
give,
but
they
can
make
you
answer,
your
honor.
and,
that
is
what
is
important.
there
are
things
you
may
not
want
to
answer.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
true.
but
my
point
is,
protection
from
the
fourth
and
fifth
are
extremely
limited
here
more
than
anywhere
else
in
this
subpoena
power
without
an
attorney
and
without
telling
you
what
the
relevancy
is
or
telling
you
what
they
are
investigating.
i
just
want
you
to
be
in
focus
here
very
precisely
the
exact
power
we
are
talking
about.
and,
now,
to
use
it
for
civil?
that
is
the
question
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case.
now,
i
am
going
to
go
to
my
argument.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
that
is
a
totally
false
argument
that
they
raise.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
i
am
not
disputing
that,
your
honor.
but,
the
issue
they
raise
is
a
totally
false
one.
the
issue
is
not,
why
are
you
interfering
with
the
organization
of
our
department.
that
is
not
the
issue.
the
issue
is
can
any
one
attorney
in
the
department
of
justice
or
u.
s.
attorney
use
these
materials
for
civil
purposes
without
a
court
order
in
advance.
that
is
the
issue,
not
whether
it
is
a
civil
division,
the
tax
division,
the
anti-trust
division
or
the
criminal...
well
the
criminal,
of
course.
but,
any
attorney
for
civil
purposes
without
first
getting
a
court
order.
that
is
the
issue
here,
not
the
organization.
the
government
has
asked
you
to
visit
with
them
in
a
place
that
i
call
procedural
ivory
tower.
i
would
like
you
now
to
go
on
a
tour
with
respondents
and
the
illustrious
amici
in
this
country
that
have
filed
in
this
case.
a
tour
that
took
you
in
the
briefs
very
quickly
through
the
contemporary
constitutional
grand
jury
and
explored
what
is
actually
going
on
and
the
abuses
that
are
actually
occurring.
i
am
not
going
to
belabor
that
here.
the
briefs
are
resplendent
with
it
and
not
just
ours,
four
others
from
across
the
country.
i
would
like
you
today
to
visit
with
me
to
another
place
one
that
justice
brennan
has
some
personal
knowledge
of.
that
is
the
case
25
years
ago
called
proctor
and
gamble,
a
case
that
the
government
relies
on
very
heavily.
now,
i
want
to
bring
you
forward
from
there
to
this
case.
i
want
to
show
you
that
this
case
is
the
third
leg
of
an
executive
triad
which
the
net
result
is
to
vest
the
total
custody
of
the
grand
jury
in
the
executive.
and,
i
want
to
explore
with
you
why
that
will
happen
in
this
case.
first,
why
are
we
leaving
the
procedural
ivory
tower?
because
this
case
and
baggot
that
follows
poses
three
questions
to
you
which
the
government
has
classified
as
procedural,
which
the
government
has
said
we
should
decide
based
upon
legislative
intent,
which
we
will
explore,
too,
which
the
government
wants
you
to
decide
in
the
ivory
tower.
respondents
and
amici
say
that
these
three
questions
pose
a
far
more
fundamental
question,
a
far
more
substantive
question,
whether
the
grand
jury
subpoena
should
be
used
as
an
ex
parte,
dual
purpose
discovery
tool
by
the
executive
to
conduct
civil
as
well
as
criminal
investigations.
i
am
talking
about
that
power
i
just
described.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
yes.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
i
want
you
to
decide
it
on
a
constitutional
ground
and
grounds,
your
honor.
and
i--
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
--yes
it
is,
and
i
will
get
to
that.
we
have
here
twin
levels
of
concern.
the
first
is
in
this
case.
the
second
is
this
case
and
baggot.
in
this
case,
they
are
asking
you
to
give
them
automatic
access
without
court
supervision
under
6(e)(3)(a)(i)...
without
court
supervision,
number
one.
number
two,
they
are
asking
you
to
apply
a
rationally
related
test,
they
say,
to
support
personnel
that
they
would
not
otherwise
classify
as
untechnical
like
secretaries
and
so
forth.
the
issues
are
broader
than
that.
once
you
make
that
ruling
were
you
to
deem
it,
you
have
just
decided
to
test
the
entire
government
for
practical
purposes
were
actually
related,
relevancy--
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
--your
honor,
i
suppose,
as
a
practical
matter,
that
might
happen.
i
do
not
think
it
should.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
i
suppose
so.
but
i
am
not,
really
not
focusing
on
the
criminal
division
because
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
practicality,
i
have
to
concede,
that
is
involved
in
the
criminal
division.
but,
i
would
say
that
that
should
be
done
with
utmost
care
for
the
very
reasons
the
government
argued
in
proctor
and
gamble,
which
i
will
give
to
you...
the
utmost
care.
now,
why
are
we
concerned
in
this
case
with
the
government
getting
automatically
without
court
supervision
or
approval
or
were
actually
related
no
test
at
all?
because--
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
--they
have
it
as
a
criminal--
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
--as
a
criminal
custodian
in
a
temporary
way
as
an
assistant
to
the
grand
jury.
whittaker
said
in
proctor
and
gamble,
"this
is
not
the
property
of
the
justice
department
or
the
u.
s.
attorney.
"
"it
is
the
property
of
the
court
and
the
grand
jury.
"
now
that
was
a
concurring
opinion,
but
he
was
the
only
one
who
said
anything
about
it
in
that
decision.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
the
prosecutor
has
that,
your
honor,
wearing
his
criminal
hat.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
but
he
is
wearing
a
criminal
hat,
and
that
is
the
point.
your
honor,
we
are
talking
about--
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
--pardon?
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
that
is
true.
and,
i
cannot
unring
the
bell.
that
is
very
true.
but
the
point
is,
how
can
he
use
it
thereafter
for
civil
purposes.
you
have
to
go
back
and
see
how
he
got
it
for
criminal
purposes
and
why
he
got
it
for
criminal
purposes
before
you
decide
he
should
be
able
to
go
on
and
use
it
for
anything
else.
that
is
a
very
clear
line
that
must
be
drawn,
and
that
is
the
line
i
want
to
be
sure
that
you
understand
needs
to
be
drawn,
your
honor.
let
me
go
back,
if
i
might,
to
our
concerns
with
regard
to
the
civil
side
of
this.
the
attorney
for
the
government
can
concurrently
develop
a
civil
case
and
has
been
doing
so,
which
i
will
demonstrate,
as
justice
brennan
may
well
recall
in
proctor
&
gamble
was
an
issue
there.
he
can
marshal
evidence
for
a
civil
case
if
he
has
to
answer
to
nobody
with
regard
to
the
use
of
that
evidence
and
automatically
apply
it.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
yes,
i
am
saying
it
is
wrong.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
the
question
was
raised
in
a
sense
in
proctor
&
gamble.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
and,
i
will
answer
it
this
way.
the
court
ducked
the
issue
and
the
buck
stops
here.
you
now
have
that
issue
before
you.
it
has
not
been
before
this
court
until
now--
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
--of
course,
the
allegations
in
that
case
were
they
never
brought
it
for
criminal
in
the
first
place,
or
if
they
did--
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
--my
position
is
that
they
should
not
be
able
to
use
the
grand
jury
for
civil
purposes,
and
i
must
say
that
proctor
&
gamble
does
raise...
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
little
gimme
here.
proctor
&
gamble
does
raise
and
anti-trust
raises
a
little
different
level,
because
anti-trust
is
not
the
traditional
civil
situation.
when
you
are
talking
about
the
sherman
act,
you
are
talking
about
a
twin
level
of
enforcement.
one
is
injunctive
relief
for
the
purpose
of
restraining
a
wrong
that
is
going
on
in
a
civil
arena.
that
is
one
that
i
do
have
to
say
falls
in
this
quasi-criminal
category,
perhaps.
but
that
is
not
the
collection
of
money.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
i
think
we
are
talking
here
about
the
collection
of
money,
and
i
think
a
fraud
claim
is
less
than...
for
this
reason.
because
injunctive
relief
is
a
civil
remedy,
it
is
not
a
criminal
remedy.
and
because
the
way
the
courts
and
the
law
are
structure
in
the
common
law
system,
you
do
it
in
the
civil
arena.
but
it
is
really
a
criminal
concept.
it
is
really
saying,
do
not
do
that.
that
is
wrong.
that
is
against
the
law,
and
we
are
going
to
enjoin
you
from
ever
doing
that
any
more.
but,
they
do
it
in
the
civil
arena.
that
is
the
only
gimme
i
will
give
you
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
you
mean
versus
the
double
damages?
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
no,
they
can
get
double
damages.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
in
a
civil
courts
claims
action.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
all
right.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
yes,
because
we
are
talking
about
compensating
somebody
to
make
him
whole.
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
there.
that
is
different
than
from
restraining
and
from
doing
an
ongoing
wrong.
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
those
two.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
well,
i
am
not
trying
to
apply
it
to
my
case
other
than
the
fact--
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
--well,
your
honor,
the
give
me
that
i
made
was
an
injunction
aspect
of
it
to
prevent
an
ongoing
wrong
which
was
criminal
itself.
that
is
the
only
give
me
i
made.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
are
you
talking
about
proctor
&
gamble?
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
well,
if
you
prosecute
criminals
you
are
going
to
send
somebody
to
jail
or
impose
a
fine,
one
of
the
two,
or
a
cease
and
desist
order
which
gets
into
the
quasi
area.
but,
if
you
are
going
to
go
for
injunctive
relief,
you
are
forcing
them
to
stop
doing
what
they
are
doing
in
a
sense.
look,
you
asked
in
a
hearing
the
other
day,
where
is
the
bright
line.
that
is
not
the
bright
line,
your
honor.
we
are
in
a
gray
area
there.
that
is
not
the
bright
line,
and
i
cannot
give
you
all
of
the
answers
absolutely,
and
i
do
not
think
you
can
decide
them
absolutely
there
either
without
a
give
and
take
situation.
the
second
level
of
concern
we
have
is
combining
baggot
and
this
case.
in
baggot
they
are
saying
the
irs
is
doing
this
preliminary
to
the
judicial
proceeding
when
they
are
doing
a
tax
investigation.
that
is
the
case
you
are
going
to
hear
argued
next.
how
you
decide
that,
coupled
with
the
rationally
related
aspect
of
their
question
here.
if
you
decide
rationally
related
is
fine
and
administrative
proceedings
are
preliminary
to
judicial
proceedings,
and,
therefore,
they
get
it
under
6(e)(3)(c)(i),
then
we
have
an
administrative
agency
in
there
using
the
grand
jury,
this
forthwith
subpoena
power,
the
power
of
the
absolute
monarch
to
collect
taxes.
is
that
what
we
want?
are
we
going
to
use
that
kind
of
a
power
to
collect
taxes?
now,
we
really
have
here
an
issue
of
the
ex
parte
power
dual
use
of
the
grand
jury.
this
issue
is
squarely
joined
in
our
briefs.
it
is
squarely
joined,
whether
you
know
it
or
not.
they
have
cited
proctor
&
gamble,
which
was
a
dual
use
case
that
i
want
to
talk
about.
and,
in
the
baggot
brief
at
page
12
of
the
summary
of
their
argument,
read
it.
you
know
what
they
tell
you?
the
government
states
there
that
it
has
been
a
very
effective
way
for
agencies
to
perform
its
dual
enforcement
programs.
they
say
there
that
the
agency
assistance
must
be
bought,
bought
by
delivering
up
the
fruits
of
the
investigation.
they
say
there
that
if
you
do
not
do
that
the
irs
will
threaten
to
stop
providing
that
assistance.
do
you
know
what
they
say
there?
they
say
there
that
the
6(e)
amendment
in
1977
which
congress
said
very
clearly
should
not
be
used
for
civil
purposes,
they
say
wipe
it
out.
that
is
what
they
say
there.
that
issue
is
joined.
let
me
talk
about
this
triad
that
i
mentioned.
the
first
leg
is
proctor
&
gamble.
proctor
&
gamble
is
important
to
the
government
for
the
purposes
of
the
triad
because
the
government
says
that
proctor
&
gamble
said
that
private
parties
are
the
only
ones
that
have
to
show
particularized
and
compelling
need,
while
the
government
hides
behind
it
and
uses
it
for
civil
purposes
any
and
every
way
it
desires.
that
is
the
first
leg
of
the
triad.
they
also
say
that
proctor
&
gamble
stands
for
the
proposition
that
automatic
access
has
been
approved
by
this
court.
nonsense.
and
i
want
to
take
you
through
that.
but,
first,
on
this
triad,
what
is
it?
it
is
proctor
&
gamble.
it
is
a
1977
6(e)
amendment,
and
it
is
sells
and
baggot
if
you
grant
them
what
they
want,
they
have
full
and
complete
and
total
executive
control
of
the
grand
jury.
the
active
agency
participation
was
decided...
it
may
not
be
constitutional...
but
it
was
decided
in
the
1977
amendment
of
6(e)
that
any
agency
personnel
for
any
reason
can
be
brought
in
without
a
court
order
and
without
court
supervision.
secondly,
the
dual
purpose
subpoena
power,
that
is
the
issue
here.
third,
easy,
wholesale
access
to
all
of
it,
that
is
at
issue
here.
fourth,
civil
administrative
proceedings
being
preliminary,
too,
that
is
an
issue
in
baggot.
restricted
private
party
access,
but,
of
course,
just
private
party
access
under
particularized
and
compelling,
that
was
in
proctor
&
gamble,
so
the
government
says.
and,
of
course,
they
proceed
to
use
it
in
cases
like
saconni
vacuum
and
so
forth
as
they
desire
with
a
very
limited
and
restrictive
capability
of
defending
against
it
as
far
as
the
other
side
is
concerned,
because
they
hover
and
hold
it
all
here
and
let
it
be
looked
at
in
camera,
et
cetera
while
they
use
it
to
refresh
witnesses
and
witnesses,
by
the
way,
which
without
attorney
being
present
were
asked
leading
questions
who
framed
their
answers
in
that
context
and
then
became
married
to
them,
not
in
the
adversary
proceeding.
and
then
they
are
stuck
with
them
later
for
they
are
inconsistent
and
their
credibility
is
gone.
what
we
have
got
here
is
the
camel's
head
went
under
the
tent
when
the
prosecutor
came
into
the
grand
jury.
in
the
1977
6(e)
amendment,
the
whole
camel
went
in.
the
government
says,
we
are
watching
the
chicken
coop,
the
fox,
and
we
will
let
you
know
if
we
are
going
to
let
you
have
materials
or
not,
and
we
will
eat
them
whenever
we
want.
and,
besides
that,
the
government
says
we
the
executive,
we
monitor
the
grand
jury
and
we
run
the
show
and
we
are
the
tail
wagging
the
dog.
that
is
what
the
government
says.
proctor
&
gamble
is
the
first
leg
of
this
triad.
it
held
that
civil
use
was
okay.
it
held
that
particularized
and
compelling
need
must
be
applied
to
grand
jury
materials
because
of
the
necessity
of
retaining
the
secrecy
doctrine
that
came
into
the
constitution
with
it.
what
was
the
real
focus
in
proctor
&
gamble?
the
certified
question
was
very
narrow,
whether
good
cause
requires
rule
34
production
by
government
for
grand
jury
testimony.
very
narrow.
there
were
prior
motions
two
years
ago...
before,
i
should
say...
two
years
before,
where
proctor
&
gamble
tried
to
suppress
and
tried
to
get
returned
and
argued
that
it
was
wrong
for
them
to
have
it
and
all
of
that.
they
were
denied
by
judge
moradelli
who
thought,
gee,
government
cannot
be
wrong...
denied
by
moradelli.
two
years
later
he
was
accusing
the
government
of
having
a
plan.
that
is
in
volume
50,
case
51
of
the
1957-58
up
in
the
library.
look
at
moradelli's
decision
in
the
case
below.
it
came
straight
up
to
this
court
under
the
expediting
act.
now,
look
at
the
brief
of
american
association
of
soap
manufacturers.
it
tells
you
precisely
the
dual
purpose
that
was
going
on
down
there
in
that
case.
there
were
alot
of
other
issues
that
the
majority
ducked
because
it
could
not
reach
agreement,
i
suggest.
perhaps
justice
brennan
can
tell
you
better.
but,
there
were
three
dissents.
harlan,
burton,
and
frankfurter
said,
hey,
why
are
we
disturbing
that
sound
discretion.
look
at
this
one-reason
opinion
of
the
trial
court.
besides
that,
the
government
is
a
recalcitrant
party,
and
they
will
not
cooperate.
why
are
we
disturbing
that.
whittaker
said,
hey,
there
is
civil
discovery
that
is
going
on
here,
and
that
is
not
right.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
yes,
your
honor.
am
i
making
a
mistake?
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
well,
i
am
saying
justice
whittaker,
and
i--
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
--i
am
sorry.
i
thought
i
was
saying
that.
justice
whittaker
said
that
civil
discovery
use
should
be
limited
for
both
sides.
it
was
not
discussed
by
the
majority
at
all.
justice
whittaker
said
that
possession
and
property
is
not
that
of
the
justice
department.
it
is
in
the
court.
justice
whittaker
said
that
equal
discovery
treatment
should
be
applied.
the
thing
that
was
not
discussed
by
anybody
was
under
what
process
of
procedure
should
the
government
be
able
to
get
this
material.
but,
what
process
of
procedure
should
the
attorney
for
the
government
be
using
it.
that
was
not
the
issue
here
because
that
was
the
issue
two
years
earlier,
and
it
did
not
come
up
on
appeal.
it
just
wasn't.
and,
this
court
had
a
hard
time
coming
to
grips
with
the
one
thing
they
did
decide
or
two.
look
at
the
major
issues
they
did
not
want
to
try
to
wrestle
with
or
could
not
wrestle
with
at
the
time.
it
was
a
strongly
divided
court.
it
was
clearly
a
dual
purpose
grand
jury
case
situation.
it
was
the
first
leg
of
the
triad
because,
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
it
said
nobody
else
out
there
can
have
this
material
but
us
except
on
a
particularized
and
compelling
need.
now,
the
government
argued
that
because
they
argued
the
rose
five
reasons
for
grand
jury
secrecy.
the
rose
five
reasons
they
argued
emphasized
the
fourth.
the
fourth
reason
being
for
witness
protection
and
with
the
emphasis
on
because
future
grand
juries
will
be
ineffective
unless
we
preserve
the
secrecy
of
this
material.
now,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
that
that
stood
for
the
proposition
of
secrecy
and
it
applied
to
all
concerned,
but
that
is
not
how
the
government
has
been
applying
it.
now,
the
government
was
in
a
role
reversal
situation.
they
were
the
ones
that
argued
secrecy.
they
were
the
ones
urging
rose
4,
and
they
were
the
ones
talking
about
the
future
of
the
grand
jury.
they
were
the
ones
that
suggested
the
words
compelling
necessity.
look
at
their
brief.
now,
let's
talk
about
the
1977
rule
6(e),
if
i
can
for
a
moment.
this
is
the
second
leg
of
the
triad.
they
urged
that
congress
ratify
their
continuing
automatic
access
which
nobody
ever
gave
them
in
the
first
place,
subselliantial.
nobody
ever
gave
it
to
them
in
the
first
place.
they
say
that
the
1977
amendments
that
the
congress
ratified
it.
they
say
so
because
of
lack
of
parallel
construction
between
(a)(1)
and
(a)
double
toothpicks.
that
is
how
they
argue
it.
first,
the
only
and
single
issue
addressed
in
the
1977
hearing...
1976
hearings
on
1977...
was
whether
or
not
there
should
be
technical
personnel.
there
was
a
colloquy
between
professor
wayne
lefave
and
congresswoman
holsmith
that
is
very
telling.
it
was
under
the
original
draft
of
the
advisory
committee
with
regard
to...
including
under
the
term,
attorneys
for
the
government...
technical
personnel
as
they
deem
necessary
all
in
the
performance
of
the
attorney's
duties.
and
she
says,
isn't
there
a
possibility
that,
for
example,
an
irs
agent
will
be
confused
about
what
the
duties
are,
and
he
will
think
it
is
duty
to
do
civil
work?
and,
professor
wayne
lefave
said,
"that
is
a
legitimate
concern.
"
"maybe
the
language
ought
to
be
changed
to
make
this
clearer
than
it
is.
"
and
that
is
exactly
what
they
did.
the
other
thing
that
is
important
is
richard
thornberg,
acting
deputy
attorney
general,
gave
testimony
to
that
committee...
and
i
am
addressing
these
two
witnesses
because
i
think
their
testimony
is
critical.
thornberg
told
the
committee,
giving
two
examples,
it
would
be
our
policy
to
always
get
a
6(e)
order.
and,
the
clearest
example
i
can
give
you
is
if
there
is
a
civil
fraud
action
and
we
cannot
make
the
case
criminally,
and
we
have
to
go
after
it
civilly,
we
will
come
in
and
get
a
6(e)
order.
then,
he
contrasted
that,
of
course,
the
prototype
here
is
the
irs
with
the
agency
involved
and
we
would
also
have
to
get
a
6(e)
order
for
the
agency.
i
submit
to
you
that
is
the
sells
case,
civil
fraud
and
irs,
sells
i
and
sells
ii.
that
is
what
is
involved.
and,
the
issue
here
is
should
they
get
a
6(e)
order.
look
at
that
testimony.
it
is
very
telling
in
that
respect.
now,
i
would
like
to
talk
briefly
just
about
duty.
duty
is
a
limiting
word.
it
is
duty
in
the
criminal
context
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
rule
6(e),
which
was
designed
purely
for
a
criminal
function.
we
are
talking
here
about
the
client,
the
function,
and
the
duty
of
the
department
of
justice
which
is
all
over
the
place.
duty
is
anything
from
hud,
epa,
special
assistant
to
the
grand
jury
to
civil
fraud
to
tax
division
to
anti-trust.
it
is
every
duty
you
can
imagine
a
lawyer
performs.
so,
we
are
talking
about
the
client,
function,
and
duty,
not
titles.
isn't
the
duty
of
an
agency
attorney
equally
as
important
in
the
collection
of
taxes
or
sec
or
otherwise
as
the
duty
of
the
justice
department
when
he
is
doing
the
same
thing.
it
is
not
titles
that
is
involved.
it
is
duty,
client,
and
function.
i
have
already
addressed
what
i
believe
to
be
a
fake
issue,
so
i
will
leave
that
one
alone.
let
me
talk
briefly
about
attorney
abuse.
attorney
abuse
is
claimed
here,
not
just
irs
abuse.
if
you
go
to
the
statement,
part
b
of
our
red
brief,
you
will
see
there
that
none
of
that
could
have
happened
without
the
active
participation
and
assistance
of
the
u.
s.
attorney's
office.
subpoenas
were
issued.
every
witness
virtually
was
diverted
to
an
intelligent
irs
agent
for
examination
and
interrogation.
in
one
situation
where
the
record
on
the
affidavits
and
transcript
in
these
proceedings,
the
record
demonstrates
that
the
ausa
participated
in
diversion
of
a
witness
to
the
irs
agent
when
there
was
not
really
a
grand
jury
panel
that
was
ever
going
to
hear
it
any
way,
because
he
says
himself
the
first
time
we
intended
to
schedule
anything
was
march,
and
this
was
going
on
in
january,
and
the
old
panel
had
terminated.
that
is
in
part
b
of
the
statement.
they
accuse
us
of
a
blunderbuss
assault.
yes,
do
you
know
what
a
blunderbuss
is?
a
large
bore,
an
old-fashioned
weapon
with
a
big
muzzle
when
loaded
with
a
lot
of
ball
is
very
effective
at
close
range.
i
accept
that
definition,
and
those
balls
all
hit
their
mark,
and
they
will
not
touch
them
with
a
ten
foot
pole
because
that
statement
is
documented
to
affidavits
of
the
government
and
transcript
99
percent.
the
sixth
reason
for
secrecy,
very
important
here.
one
more
to
add
to
rose.
it
was
said
by
justice
whittaker,
to
eliminate
the
temptation
to
conduct
grand
jury
investigations
as
a
means
of
ex
parte
procurement
of
direct
or
derivative
evidence
for
use
in
a
contemplated
civil
suit.
add
it
to
the
other
five,
because
there
is
a
ground
swell
out
there
that
is
begging
you
to
add
it.
the
lower
courts,
many
of
them
have
come
down
with
that.
the
seventh
and
the
ninth
in
baggot
and
here...
excuse
me,
miller,
baggot
in
the
seventh...
and
the
ninth
here
have
said
it.
and,
there
are
many
courts
and
legal
commentators
that
have
said
it.
add
it.
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
the
grand
jury
is
still
here?
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
yes.
i
am
simply
saying
add
it
to
one
of
the
standards
to
be
looked
at
for
the
purpose
of
protection
of
secrecy
doctrine.
secrecy
has
a
constitutional
dimension.
this
court
said
in
1943
in
johnson,
it
is
indispensable.
in
1956
in
costello,
"a
body
of
laymen
acting
in
secret.
"
in
1959
in
pittsburgh
"secrecy
is
part
of
the
modus
operandi
of
the
grand
jury.
"
in
1979,
"it's
proper
functioning
depends
upon
it.
"
it
went
into
the
bill
of
rights
as
a
citizen
protection.
it
was
utterly
dependent
upon
secrecy
because
before
secrecy
it
was
absolute
power
of
the
monarch--
mr.
arlington
ray
robbins
--thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
