justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
letter,
straighten
me
out,
please.
the
grand
jury
minutes
are
in
the
possession
of
the
u.s.
attorney.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
a
division
of
the
u.s.
attorney
wants
to
see
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
and,
they
could
have
gotten
it
by
just
asking
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
did
you
file
a
motion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
the
minutes
are
not
open
to
anybody
in
the
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
anybody
in
this
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
to
give
these
notes
to
somebody
outside
of
the
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
in
the
united
states
department
of
justice.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
did
not
want
to
give
them
to
anybody
outside
of
the
united
states
department
of
justice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
ever
give
anything
to
the
navy
without
a
court
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
care
about
any
rule.
is
it
normally
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
not
dealing
with
14
or
15
different
animals.
we
are
dealing
with
one,
the
united
states
government.
you
did
not
want
to
give
it
to
anybody
outside
of
the
united
states
government,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
just
looks
to
me
like
a
law
suit
that
just
is
a
little
unnecessary.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
did
you
file
the
motion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
the
only
reason
we
got
this
case
is
because
you
filed
a
motion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
that
prevents
them
from
doing
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
(ii)
was
limited
to
criminal--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--investigations--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--which
does
not
apply
here
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
other
way
irs
can
operate
in
the
courts
except
through
the
civil
division?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
they
already
have
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
keep
saying
they
are
trying
to
get
it.
i
thought
they
had
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
has
custody
of
the
copies
of
the
grand
jury
minutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought...
i
do
not
know
what
kind
of
hat
he
had
on,
but
he
had
it.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
sees
through
the
same
eyes,
doesn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
sees
through
the
same
eyes
whichever
hat
he
has
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
grand
jury
is
still
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
