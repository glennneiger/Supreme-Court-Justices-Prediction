mr.
douglas
n.
letter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
issues
before
the
court
in
this
case.
the
first
is
whether
attorneys
in
the
civil
division
of
the
department
of
justice
may
have
access
as
of
right
to
grand
jury
material
as
attorneys
for
the
government
pursuant
to
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
6(e)(3)(a)(i)
and
54(c).
the
second
issue
is
what
standard
the
civil
division
must
meet
to
show
grand
jury
material
to
assisting
personnel.
if
the
court
rules
against
us
on
the
first
issue,
then
the
second
issue
also
concerns
what
standard
the
division
must
meet
for
access
by
its
own
attorneys.
it
is
our
position
that
this
case
does
not
involve
a
question
of
grand
jury
secrecy,
but
instead
concerns
how
the
attorney
general
organizes
the
department
of
justice.
briefly,
the
facts
were
that
respondents,
sells,
witte,
and
sells
engineering
corporation
were
indicted
on
a
number
of
counts
of
tax
fraud
and
fraud
against
the
united
states.
there
were
other
persons
who
were
also
indicted
along
with
them.
sells
and
witte
were
officers
in
sells
engineering
corporation
which
had
contracts
with
the
department
of
the
navy
to
produce
defense
systems.
the
defendants
moved
to
quash
the
indictments
making
various
allegations
of
grand
jury
abuse.
the
main
allegation
seems
to
have
been
at
the
time
they
were
complaining
about
an
indictment
based
on
hearsay,
it
appears.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
word
of
art,
your
honor.
i
believe
in
this
case,
respondents
are
the
first
ones
who
used
it.
i
believe
it
is
unclear
what
they
mean.
as
i
say,
they
claim
that
apparently
they
thought
the
grand
jury
had
been
used
for
an
improper
purpose
by
the
u.s.
attorney's
office.
i
think
that
is
what
they
mean
by
abuse.
even
though
they
made
this
motion
to
quash
the
indictment,
sells
and
witte
withdrew
the
motion
and
pleaded
guilty
to
a
count
of
conspiracy
to
commit
fraud
against
the
government
by
inhibiting
investigation...
a
tax
investigation.
shortly
before
the
guilty
pleas
were
entered,
the
civil
division
of
the
department
of
justice
came
into
the
district
court
where
the
criminal
proceedings
were
pending
and
sought
access
to
the
grand
jury
materials.
the
division
sought
the
materials
because
it
thought
that
it
might
need
them
in
order
to
bring
a
false
claims
action
against
some
of
the
defendants.
as
far
as
other
defendants
were
concerned,
one
other
defendant
pleaded
guilty
and
another
defendant
was
convicted.
in
order
to
avoid
any
confusion,
i
think
it
would
be
important
at
this
point
to
look
precisely
at
rule
6(e)
itself.
rule--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
i
do
not
believe
they
did.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
they
could
have
done
it
for
the
civil
division
attorneys,
correct.
but,
for
the
assisting
personnel
we
concede
that--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--that
is
right.
and,
in
fact,
they
made
that
argument
to
the
district
court.
they
said
that
under
the
fifth
circuit
decision
upon
which
we
were
relying
the
civil
division
attorneys
were
entitled
as
a
matter
of
right.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
sure.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
when
you
say
support
personnel
meaning
the
attorney's
secretary?
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
no,
we
do
not
believe
so.
we
think
that
the
secretaries
for
the
civil
division
attorneys
must
be
considered
in
essence
part
of
the
attorneys
themselves.
a
reason
for
this
would
be
that
otherwise
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
attorneys
to
even
make
the
motion--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
well,
if
we
are
talking
about
technical
personnel
like
accountants,
things
like
that,
then,
yes,
they
would
need
an
order
under
rule
6(e)(3)(c)(i),
but
the
secretaries
would
not
because
otherwise
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
attorneys
to
even
make
a
motion
to
the
court
because
if
the
motion
was
going
to
discuss
the
grand
jury
material,
the
attorneys
apparently
would
have
to
type
it
themselves,
and
we
do
not
think
that
congress
ever
intended
such
a
thing.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
pardon
me?
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
that
would
be--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--correct.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
when
you
say
division
of
the
u.
s.
attorney,
a
division
of
the
department
of
justice,
obviously
part
of
the
same
organization.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
that
is
our
position,
yes.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
we
filed
a
motion,
one,
because
we
wanted
access
for
assisting
personnel,
and
also--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--the
minutes
are
certainly
open
to
the
assistant
united
states
attorneys
who--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--that
is
correct.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
we
wanted
to
give
them
to
the
civil
division
attorneys
in
washington,
d.
c.--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--that
is
correct,
within
the
department
of
justice--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--we
did.
we
also
wanted
to
give
them
to
personnel
from
the
department
of
the
navy
to
help
analyze
this
technical
material,
and
that
we
definitely
needed
the
court
order
for.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
under
rule
6(e)--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--no,
it
is
not
done--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--no,
your
honor,
we
certainly
did
not.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
as
far
as
the
attorneys
for
the
government,
we
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
we
filed
the
motion
because,
as
i
say,
we
had
to
to
show
it
to
the
navy
personnel.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
as
far
as
why
we
have
an
appeal
is
because
respondents
objected
to
the
disclosure.
if
we
can
go
back
a
moment,
as
i
say,
it
would
be
important
to
look
exactly
at
what
the
rule
provides.
rule
6(e)
sets
a
general
practice
of
grand
jury
secrecy.
however,
it
sets
up
exceptions.
rule
6(e)(3)(a)(i)
provides
access
as
of
right,
meaning
without
a
court
order
to
attorneys
for
the
government
in
the
performance
of
their
duties.
rule
54(c)
then
defines
attorneys
for
the
government
as
authorized
assistants
of
the
attorney
general
and
authorized
assistants
of
the
united
states
attorneys.
rule
6(e)(3)(a)(ii)
provides
that
personnel
assisting
the
prosecutor
in
enforcing
criminal
law
can
have
access
as
of
right
to
the
material.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
only
the
department
of
justice
and
united
states
attorneys
have
the
authority
to
bring
criminal
proceedings.
and,
in
fact,
i
might
add,
the
department--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--could
the
department
of
the
navy
have
done
so?
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
if
they
did,
they
would
have
had
to
seek--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--no,
under
rule
6(e)(3)(c)(i)--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--they
could
have.
there
would
be
some
question,
i
suppose,
whether
they
could
appear
in
court
without
the
department
of
justice.
the
department
of
justice
could
seek
it
on
their
behalf...
their
lawyers.
the
department
of
navy
attorneys
cannot
appear
on
court
on
their
own
behalf.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
i
think
that
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
that,
and
i
think
either
one
supports
our
position.
one
is
that
they
do
not
mean
precisely
the
same
thing.
rule
6(d),
i
think,
is
what
you
are
referring
to
which
sets
out
who
can
be
in
the
grand
jury
room.
clearly,
rule
6(e)
cannot
mean
that
only
attorneys
who
were
in
the
grand
jury
room
can
have
access
to
the
grand
jury
materials.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
a
situation
often
happens
where
a
department
of
justice
attorney
handles
a
presentation
to
the
grand
jury,
and
then
that
attorney
leaves
government
service.
now,
obviously,
a
new
attorney
has
to
be
appointed
in
order
to
handle
the
criminal
prosecution.
it
is
clear
under
rule
6(e)
that
the
new
attorney
who
was
not
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
since
at
the
time
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
handling
the
grand
jury
probably
should
not
have
been
in
the
grand
jury
room,
could
nonetheless
have
access
to
the
grand
jury
materials
in
order
to
prepare
the
criminal
case.
another
way
of
looking
at
it
is
to
say
that
the
section
do
mean
the
same,
and
there
is
nothing
in
rule
6(d)
that
would
prohibit
a
department
of
justice,
civil
division
attorney
from
sitting
in
during
a
grand
jury
presentation.
now,
that
is
not
the
practice
of
the
department
of
justice,
mostly
because
we
wish
to
avoid
any
appearance
that
a
grand
jury
is
being
used
for
civil
purpose.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
as
i
have
pointed
out
before,
rule
6(e)(3)(a)(ii)
provides
access
by
assisting
personnel,
assisting
in
the
criminal
law
enforcement--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--right.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
i
believe
it
can.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
anything
in
the
rule
6(d)
or
its
legislative
history
that
we
have
been
able
to
locate
that
would
say
that
a
civil
division
attorney
could
not
sit
in,
so
i
believe
it
could.
i
would
like
to
emphasize,
though,
that
would
not
be
the
department
of
justice
practice
to
do
that.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
as
i
say,
we
would
like
to
avoid
any
appearance
of
impropriety...
any
appearance
that
we
were
using
the
grand
jury
for
a
purely
civil
purpose.
that
would
be
the
only
reason.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
i
agree.
[laughter]
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
rule
6(e)(3)(b)
then
puts
a
limit
on
the
use
that
assistant
personnel
can
make
of
the
grand
jury
material.
they
can
only
use
the
material
to
assist
in
the
prosecution.
they
cannot
turn
around
and
take
that
information
back
to
their
agencies.
rule
6(e)(3)(c)(i)
then
provides
for
release
pursuant
to
court
order
preliminary
to
or
in
connection
with
the
judicial
proceeding.
and,
that
is
the
section
under
which
we
would
seek
access
for
assisting
personnel
from
the
department
of
the
navy.
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
district
court
put
off
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
several
days.
in
the
interim
the
defendants
pleaded
guilty.
then,
the
district
court
heard
from
both
sides,
and
it
determined
that
the
respondents
had
withdrawn
their
grand
jury
abuse
allegations.
nevertheless,
the
district
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
grand
jury
abuse.
the
court,
therefore,
granted
the
motion
permitting
access.
the
respondents
appealed,
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
i
would
like
to
set
out
up
front
why
the
civil
division
needs
the
grand
jury
material.
the
division
often
receives
referrals
from
united
states
attorneys,
criminal
division,
fbi,
when
there
has
been
criminal
conduct,
and
it
is
possible
that
there
would
be
a
civil
fraud
action.
it
gets
this
material
obviously
long
before
any
civil
case
is
filed,
and
it
uses
the
material
for
screening
purposes.
very
often,
the
civil
division
attorneys
will
look
at
the
material
and
decide
that
there
is
no
false
claims
action
here
and
so
they
will
drop
the
case.
they
will
not
use
department
of
justice
resources
in
further
investigation.
thus,
this
access
to
the
grand
jury
material
really
leads
to
better
governmental
practices,
because
it
means
that
the
department
does
not
have
to
file
premature
civil
fraud
complaints
which
would
obviously
be--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--that
is
precisely
correct,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--not
entirely,
your
honor,
but
let
me
go
through
that.
first
of
all,
we
believe...
the
civil
division
believes
it
is
a
very
serious
matter
to
bring
a
fraud
complaint
by
the
department
of
justice
against
a
corporation.
so,
we
would
like
to
avoid
that
unless
we
have
very
solid
evidence
to
support
such
a
complaint.
so,
we
are
very
reluctant
to
just
file
a
complaint
in
order
to
get
civil
discovery.
civil
discovery
is
not
going
to
be
adequate
because
we
are
talking
about
obtaining
grand
jury
transcripts
for
much
of
this
material...
much
of
this
material
is
grand
jury
transcripts.
this
is
not
material
that
is
in
the
hands
of
the
defendants.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
the
defendant
might
have
a
copy
of
some
of
it,
but
if
it
is
some
other
witness,
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
defendant
has
copies
of--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--the
witness
might
have--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--it
is
possible.
but,
some
of
the
witnesses
certainly
might
not
have
requested
transcripts.
in
any
event,
we
might
be
able
to
get
much
of
the
material
from
discovery.
obviously,
there
is
some
problem
of
delay,
but
that
would
require
the
department
of
justice
to
duplicate
the
investigation
that
it
just
did
for
the
criminal
proceedings.
and,
that
is
why
we
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
evidence
that
congress
intended
to
force
the
department
to
use
its
limited
resources
in
a
way
to
duplicate
this
massive
investigation.
and,
in
this
case
we
are
talking
about
thousands
of
hours
in
investigatory
work.
and,
so,
while
it
might
be
possible
to
get
much
of
this
material,
it
would
cause
an
enormous
amount
of
work,
and
the
sad
thing
would
be,
once
we
gathered
the
material,
we
may
then
decide
that
there
is
no
false
claims
action
that
should
be
pursued
and
we
would
drop
it.
that
is
why,
as
i
say,
the
screening
process
leads
to
better
governmental
practices.
we
would
also,
then,
use
the
material
to
prepare
the
civil
case,
and
i
think
i
have
gone
into
that
a
little
already.
the
point
there
is
we
want
to
avoid
duplication
of
an
investigation
already
done.
this
practice
of
access
as
of
right
by
civil
division
attorneys
is
a
well-established
practice
going
back
many
years.
it
is
also
not
limited
to
the
civil
division
in
u.
s.
attorneys
offices
and
other
divisions
within
the
justice
department.
attorneys
with
civil
responsibilities
have
routinely
had
access
as
a
matter
of
right
to
the
grand
jury
material.
our
position
is
that
this
is
what
the
law
says,
and
that
the
civil
division
is
entitled
to
access
as
of
right
under
6(e)(3)(a)(i).
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
let
us
start
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
here
the
plain
language
definitely
supports
us
in
two
ways.
the
first
is
6(e)(3)(a)(i)
says
that
attorneys
for
the
government
in
performance
of
their
duties
may
have
access.
the
department
of
justice,
civil
division
attorneys
are
attorneys
for
the
government
as
rule
54(c)
defines
them,
and
they
are
performing
their
duties.
under
regulation
the
civil
division
attorneys
are
authorized
to
bring
false
claims
act
actions.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
that
is
right,
and
that
is
where
the
next...
plain
language
helps
us
again.
if
we
look
at
rule
6(e)(3)(a)(ii)
and
rule
6(e)(3)(b)
both
of
them
have
a
crucial
clause
that
was
added
in
1977
that
is
missing
from
rule
6(e)(3)(a)(i)
and
that
is,
assisting
personnel
may
have
access
to
grand
jury
material
in
order
to
assist
the
government
attorney
in
enforcing
federal
criminal
law.
that
section
is
not
in
6(e)(3)(a)(i).
and,
so
the
fact
that
that
is
not
there
evidences
congress'
intent
that
the
performance
of
the
attorney
for
the
government's
duties
not
be
limited
to
criminal
law.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
as
with
many
provisions,
yes.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
then
we
would
go
to
rule
6(e)(3)(c)(i)--
mr.
douglas

--we
do
not
think
that
particularized
need
is
the--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--right,
we
do
have
to
go
to
another
section--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--that
is
right.
when
you
say
supporting
personnel,
maybe...
i
want
to
make
absolutely
clear...
we
are
saying
the
attorney's
secretary
is
part
of
the
lawyer.
i
am
not
sure
if
that
is
what
you
were
asking.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
6(e)(3)(a)(ii)--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--6(e)(e)(b)--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--it
is
reprinted
in
the
back
of
our
brief
at
page
2a,
and
it
says,
"such
government
personnel
as
are
deemed
necessary
by
an
attorney
for
the
government
to
assist
an
attorney
for
the
government
in
the
performance
of
such
attorney's
duty
to
enforce
federal
criminal
law.
"
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
yes,
that
would.
i
am
sorry,
when
you--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--the
prosecutor's
secretary,
we
would
say,
would
be
included
under
6(e)(3)(a)(i).
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
when
we
look
at
the
legislative
history--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--i
think
the
legislative
history
of
6(e)(3)(a)(ii)
shows
that
that
is
not
what
congress
was
talking
about.
congressional
concern--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--for
secretaries,
certainly.
that
is
obviously
not
the
main
part
of
our
argument
here.
we
are
concerned--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--that
is
right.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
that
is
right.
if
i
could
go
back
a
moment
when
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
that
the
plain
language
could
have
been
clearer
certainly.
but,
again,
we
think
that
supports
us
because
this
practice
has
been
in
existence
for
many
years,
and
there
is
certainly
no
indication
anywhere
in
the
language
or
the
legislative
history
that
congress
meant
to
disapprove
it
in
any
way.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor.
we
are
talking
here
about
access
by
civil
division
attorneys
only.
if
they
wanted
to
show
it
to
irs
personnel--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--irs
lawyers,
same
thing.
remember--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--the
same
thing
as
any
other
irs
personnel
for
these
rules
because--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--no,
tax
division
lawyers--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--no,
rule
54(c)
specifically
defines
attorney
for
the
government,
and
it
says,
assistants
of
the
attorney
general
and
assistants
of
the
united
states
attorneys.
so,
congress
has
drawn
the
line
between
the
department
of
justice
and
other
agencies.
so,
while
an
irs
attorney
is
clearly
an
attorney
who
is
employed
by
the
united
states
government,
under
the
rules
he
is
not
an
attorney
for
the
government.
so,
automatic
access
by
the
civil
division
does
not
affect
the
baggot
case
because--
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
--we
cannot
reveal
the
information
to
them.
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
rules,
and
we
could
be
placed
in
contempt.
we
could
only
get
the
information
to
them
pursuant
to
a
court
order
under
rule
6(e)(3)(c)(i).
again,
this
is
if
we
are
talking
about
a
use
for
civil
purpose.
it
is
important
to
note,
we
are
not
talking
about
release
for
public
purposes.
we
are
talking
about
release
as
of
right
to
remain
within
the
department
of
justice.
and,
only
through
court
order
would
we
seek
any
other
kind
of
release.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
i
do
not
think
civil
division
attorneys
could
conduct
an
irs
investigation,
your
honor.
that
is
not
what...
the
department
of
justice
has
certain
functions
which
are
to
provide
representation
to
the
government
in
court.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
in
the
united
states
district
court
they
operate
through
the
tax
division
of
the
department
of
justice
and
through
the
united
states
attorneys,
i
believe.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
right.
i
would
like
to
briefly
touch
on
what,
i
think,
is
our
most
telling
point,
which
is
one
that
the
other
side
has
largely
ignored,
and
that
is
the
dual
responsibility
of
the
department
of
justice.
the
department
of
justice
has
both
civil
and
criminal
responsibilities.
attorneys
within
the
department
of
justice
can
be
assigned
civil
responsibilities
or
criminal
responsibilities
or
both
at
any
time
by
the
attorney
general.
and,
in
fact,
in
many
cases,
both
in
smaller
united
states
attorneys
offices
and
in
a
number
of
divisions
of
the
department
of
justice,
many
attorneys
operate
every
day
on
those
dual
responsibilities.
the
result
of
the
order
here,
all
that
it
would
be
is
that
it
would
force
the
attorney
general
to
restructure
the
civil
frauds
unit
and
combine
it
with
criminal
fraud...
the
criminal
fraud
unit,
and
under
the
proctor
and
gamble
decision
the
attorney
then
would
clearly
have
access
as
of
right
to
the
grand
jury
material.
so,
that
all
the
decision
does
here
and
all
respondent
position
does
is
interfere
with
how
the
attorney
general
is
going
to
organize
the
justice
department.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
douglas
n.
letter
i
have
several
brief
points.
first,
i
just
want
to
point
out,
mr.
robbins
talked
about
the
policies
of
grand
jury
secrecy
being
implicated.
our
position
in
no
way
interferes
with
grand
jury
secrecy
because
as
justice
marshall
has
pointed
out
a
couple
of
times,
the
government
already
has
the
grand
jury
material.
we
are
talking
about
giving
it
from
one
department
of
justice
attorney
to
another
department
of
justice
attorney.
witnesses
testifying
before
the
grand
jury
are
not
concerned
that
their
testimony
will
be
seen
by
one
department
of
justice
attorney
as
opposed
to
the
one
in
the
office
next
door.
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
case
is
the
concern
is
that
the
witness'
employer
or
the
target
in
the
in
the
investigation
will
see
it.
i
cannot
emphasize
strongly
enough,
we
already
have
the
material,
and
it
is
just
given
from
one
attorney
to
another.
second,
we
are
relying
on
the
majority
opinion
in
proctor
&
gamble.
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
whittaker
i
do
not
think
helps
mr.
robbins
very
much,
but
we
are
looking
at
the
majority
opinion,
pages
683
and
684
that
mr.
robbins
apparently
is
ignoring,
and
i
think
that
they
are
directly
on
point.
finally,
in
further
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
earlier,
in
the
baggot
case
we
are
seeking...
the
irs
seeks
the
information
for
tax
assessment
purposes.
the
department
of
justice,
tax
division
does
not
do
tax
assessment
purposes.
if
the
department
were
going
to
get
into
that
that
would
have
to
be
arranged
by
congress
which
could
obviously
take
care
of
any
problems
at
that
point.
so,
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
problem
here.
does
the
court
have
any
further
questions?
thank
you.
