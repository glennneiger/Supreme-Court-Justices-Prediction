justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
do
that,
can
i
ask
one
question
about
the
way
the
case
developed...
about
when
you
say
they
came
in
and
sought
access,
by
that
you
mean
they
filed
a
motion
in
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
before
doing
that
ask
the
united
states
attorney
in
charge
of
the
criminal
prosecution
just
to
turn
the
material
over?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
if
you
prevail
in
the
case
they
could
have
done
that,
we
would
have
avoided
all
of
these
issues,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
would
have
been
an
argument,
yes.
but,
for
the
attorneys
themselves
they
could
have
just
asked
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
letter,
do
you
think
the
words,
(3)(a)(i)
that
you
just
read
to
us
have
the
same
meaning
as
the
words,
"attorney
for
the
government"
in
the
general
rule
of
secrecy
provision
about
who
can
go
into
the
grand
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
sorry.
i
just
do
not
understand
your
answer.
you
say,
no
matter
how
you
answer
it
it
is
still
consistent
with
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
still
is
what
do
you
think
the
correct
answer
is?
what
do
the
words,
"attorney
for
the
government"
mean
when
you
are
talking
about
the
attorneys
who
may
be
present
in
the
grand
jury
room?
does
that
include
civil
division
personnel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument
here?
are
you
saying
it
is
wrong
for
him
to
do
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
saying...
for
years
and
years
the
anti-trust
division
used
to
run
grand
juries
and
sometimes
they
would
indict
and
sometimes
they
would
not,
then
they
would
bring
a
civil
proceeding
after.
you
are
saying
all
of
those
civil
proceedings
were
improperly
brought
if
the
information
was
obtained
in
a
criminal
investigation
that
then
aborted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
and
i
am
just
wondering
how
you
answer
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
the
thrust
of
your
argument
that
if
we
had
a
similar
situation
and
the
anti-trust
division
ran
a
grand
jury,
decided
the
evidence
was
not
strong
enough
to
indict,
but
that
they
thought
they
should
bring
a
civil
proceeding,
could
they
or
could
they
not
bring
a
civil
proceeding,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
my
hypothetical
was
rather
clear.
i
am
trying
to
understand
what
your
position
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
a
fraud
claim
is
less
criminal
than
an
anti-trust
civil
case?
