justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
term
grand
jury
abuse
a
word
of
art?
i
noticed
it
in
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case.
i
was
not
otherwise
familiar
with
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
drastic
a
sanction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
drastic
a
sanction?
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
rule
6(d)
set
out
somewhere
in
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
letter,
i
take
it,
then,
the
government
does
not
follow
the
practice
of
many
private
civil
litigants
of
simply
filing
a
law
suit
and
getting
rather
extensive
discovery
to
decide
whether
the
law
suit
should
have
been
filed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
what
all
the
fighting
is
about
here
because
i
had
the
impression
from
reading
the
briefs
that
if
the
government
were
precluded
from
doing
what
it
did
here
it
could
have
filed
a
civil
action
for
fraud,
gotten
very
extensive
discovery
and
presumably
gotten
everything
it
could
have
gotten
from
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
those
originals,
then,
that
are
before
the
grand
jury
of
which
the
defendant
has
no
copy
or
anything?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
witness
would
have
a
copy,
wouldn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
could
depose
a
witness
as
well
as
a
party
in
your
civil
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
a
person
cannot
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
can
invoke
the
fifth
amendment,
but
then
our
cases
have
held
that
the
immunity
is
a
whole
equal
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
are
lots
of
things
you
may
not
want
to
answer.
that
does
not
mean
the
government
cannot
ask.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
government
wants
us
to
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
legislative
intent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
what
basis
do
you
want
us
to
decide
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
argued
in
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
a
gimme
on
the
single-damage
action
by
the
government
in
the
civil
anti-trust
case,
just
damages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
the
government
can
only
get
single
damages.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
they
get
double?
okay,
whatever
the
government
gets--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--no,
i
mean
in
an
anti-trust
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
that
is
beyond
the
rule
if
the
government
uses
its
criminal
anti-trust
investigation
materials
to
bring
a
civil
action
to
recover
damages
in
an
anti-trust
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
i
make
the
distinction,
i
do
not
see
how
in
the
world
it
applies
to
your
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
it
applies
to
your
reasoning?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
is
an
ongoing
wrong
that
is
criminal
in
itself,
why
did
the
government
abandon
its
criminal
anti-trust
prosecution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
am
talking
about
your
hypotheticals.
the
hypothetical
was
that
the
government
either
gives
up
its
criminal
anti-trust
prosecution
or...
now
you
say
that
it
is
an
ongoing
criminal
wrong.
i
would
think
the
government
would
again
prosecute
criminals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
referring
to
justices
of
this
court
who
have
written
opinions
by
their
last
names
only?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
you
are.
