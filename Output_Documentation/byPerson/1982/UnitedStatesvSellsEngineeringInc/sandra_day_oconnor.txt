as
long
as
you
are
interrupted,
may
i
ask--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
is
your
position
that
under
your
view
the
civil
division
attorneys
could
have
these
grand
jury
materials
as
a
matter
or
right.
would
you
then
think
that
the
civil
division
attorney
would
have
to
get
a
court
order
before
disclosing
the
grand
jury
materials
to
support
personnel?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.

how
about
other
people
working
for--
justice

--how
about
other
people
working
for
them?
justice

mr.
letter,
this
case
is
related,
of
course,
in
a
sense
to
the
next
one,
the
baggot
case.
and,
normally
for
the
irs,
for
example,
or
another
administrative
agency
to
get
access
to
grand
jury
materials
in
a
civil
matter,
the
court
has
to
find
that
it
is
preliminary
to
a
judicial
proceeding.
now,
if
you
are
correct
in
your
view
that
any
civil
litigation
attorney
has
automatic
access
without
a
court
order
to
the
grand
jury
documents,
then
it
no
longer
becomes
necessary
to
consider
whether
it
is
preliminary
to
a
judicial
proceeding
and
presumably
it
would
give
irs,
in
effect,
everything
it
wanted
in
baggot
without
any
court
order?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wouldn't
it
likely
do
so
indirectly?
they
just
go
to
you
and
say,
look
we
have
got
a
problem
here.
you
folks
get
into
to
it
and--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
i
assume
the
government
could
restructure
a
little
bit
and
use
civil
division
attorneys
to
staff
these
things
like
irs
investigations.
