justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
first
case
is
united
states
versus
sells
engineering.
it's
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
presents
a
single
question.
it
is,
under
what
conditions
attorneys
for
the
civil
division
of
the
justice
department
and
their
paralegal
and
secretarial
staff
may
obtain
access
to
grand
jury
materials
compiled
under
direction
of
other
justice
department
attorneys
compiled
--
and
whether
they
can
obtain
access
to
such
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
in
pursuing
a
civil
suit.
on
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
attorneys
in
the
civil
division
of
the
justice
department
and
their
assistants
and
staff
may
not
obtain
automatic
disclosure
of
grand
jury
materials
for
use
in
a
civil
suit,
but
must
instead
seek
court
order
under
rule
6(e)(3)(c)(i)
for
access
to
such
materials.
the
chief
justice
joined
by
justices
powell,
rehnquist,
and
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
