ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
state
criminal
defendant
is
entitled
to
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
on
the
grounds
that
his
assigned
appellate
counsel
failed
to
raise
every
non
frivolous
issue
requested
by
the
defendant.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
held
that
he
is
and
created
a
pro
se
rule
that
appellant
counsel
is
automatically
ineffective
if
he
fails
to
raise
an
issue
that
meets
two
tests.
one,
it
has
some
possible
merit,
however
slight;
and,
two,
it
was
requested
by
the
defendant
on
a
very
generous
construction
of
the
term
"request".
that
decision
is
wrong
for
several
reasons.
it
upsets
state
convictions
without
any
showing
of
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
it
is
not
required
by
any
principle
or
constitutional
law
or
sound
judicial
administration.
it
undermines
rather
than
promoting
effective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel,
and
it
is
an
unmanageable,
unworkable
rule
that
requires
courts
to
probe
the
attorney
client
relationship
after
the
fact
and
distinguish
requests
that
would
trigger
the
rule
from
suggestions
or
discussions
or
things
mentioned
in
passing
that
would
not.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
the
question...
whether
a
particular
question
is
non
frivolous,
being
a
question
of
law,
it
seems
to
me,
is
necessarily
before
this
court
and
the
predicate
for
determining
whether
the
rule
stated
by
the
second
circuit
is...
was
appropriately
announced
in
this
case.
the
question
of
whether
a
request
was
made
is
in
part
a
factual
question
and
while
that
matter
is
discussed
at
some
length
in
the
brief,
it
is
unnecessary
for
this
court
to
explore
the
intricacies
of
the
attorney
client
relationship
and
decide
whether
a
request
was
made
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
that
term.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
except
for
this
point.
the
second
circuit
gave
a
particular
meaning
to
request,
and
it
would
be
misleading
to
understand
the
second
circuit
rule
as
applying
only
to
that
case
in
which
there
was
a
square
conflict
between
attorney
and
client
in
which
an
explicit
request
was
made
and
that
request
was
refused.
the
second
circuit's
definition
of
request
for
purposes
of
its
rule
encompasses
much
more.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
they
found--
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
they
characterized
what
had
happened
as
a
request
and
as
an
insistence,
that
is
correct.
they
also
recite
what
they
imply
that
from.
it
must
at
least
be
said
that
what
they
found
was
an
implied
request
and
implied
insistence.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
what
the
record
shows
is
that
before
appellate
counsel
was
appointed,
the
defendant
drafted
a
pro
se
brief
which
included
a
number
of
issues.
after
his
appellate
counsel
was
appointed,
he
sent
that
brief
to
counsel.
there
was
some
correspondence
between
defendant
and
counsel
in
the
course
of
which
a
number
of
issues
were
discussed.
the
record
includes
a
letter
from
counsel
to
the
defendant
which
says,
i
have
considered
these
various
issues,
and
i
believe
that
none
of
them
are
supported
by
the
record,
however,
here
are
seven
more
issues
which
i
am
thinking
about
raising.
and
ultimately
counsel
filed
a
brief
which
included
three
issues
from
counsel's
list
of
seven.
he
also
filed
defendant's
original
pro
se
brief.
defendant
drafted
another
pro
se
brief
which
included
some
more
of
the
issues
from
counsel's
list
and
those
too
were
before
the
appellate
division.
so,
there
was
much
discussion
between
attorney
and
client
about
issues.
that
is
what
the
second
circuit
found
to
constitute
a
request.
i
should
say
that
the
record
is
sufficient
to
show
that
the
defendant...
that
counsel's
performance
satisfied
both
the
farce
and
mockery
standard
for
effective
assistance
of
counsel
and
the
more
demanding
standard
of
reasonable
professional
competence.
the
district
court,
the
second
circuit,
and
this
court
have
before
it
all
these
various
briefs,
which
are
in
the
joint
appendix
and
that
excerpt
from
the
attorney
client
correspondence
that
i
have
described,
all
of
that
is
sufficient
to
show
that
counsel
painstakingly
reviewed
the
issues
and
made
a
reasonable
selection
of
them,
giving
attention
to
defendant's
concerns.
if
this
court
were
to
find
some
possible
merit
in
the
second
circuit's
pro
se
request
rule,
it
should,
nevertheless,
reverse
rather
than
remand
in
this
case
because
of
the
extra
ordinarily
broad
notion
of
requests
that
satisfied
the
second
circuit.
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
would
be
necessary,
which
is
what
this
discussion
about
the
record
suggests,
only
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
the
extraordinary
rule
that
the
omission
by
counsel
of
any
issue
mentioned
in
communication
between
attorney
and
client
raised
a
rebuttable
presumption
of
ineffective
assistance
and
then
a
hearing
would
be
necessary
to
permit
the
state
an
opportunity
to
rebut
the
presumption
and
inquire
into
the
nature
of
communications
between
attorney
and
client
and
discover
why
particular
issues
were
or
were
not
raised.
but,
since
it
is
our
position
that
that
rule
in
not
what
the
constitution
requires,
no
further
exploration
of
the
facts
is
necessary.
the
second
circuit's
rule
requires
counsel
to
suppress
professional
judgment
and
simply
transmit
arguments
to
the
court
instead
of
submitting
a
brief
that
counsel
believes
would
be
most
effective.
the
second
circuit
suggested
that
this
was
a
natural
extension
of
anders,
this
court's
decision
in
anders,
but,
in
fact,
this
decision...
and
this
situation
is
totally
different
from
the
situation
in
anders...
that
governs
the
situation
where
counsel
finds
no
meritorious
issues
and
his
professional
judgment
would
lead
him
to
withdraw
the
appeal.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
counsel
must
set
forth
the
possible
issues
any
way
even
though
he
regards
them
as
lacking
in
merit.
the
anders
defendant
doesn't
lose
the
benefit
of
professional
judgment
because
counsel's
professional
judgment
would
be
of
no
benefit
to
him.
by
contrast,
in
a
case
like
this
one,
where
counsel
has
a
strategy
for
effective
presentation
of
the
appeal,
then
the
second
circuit
rule
would
suppress
that
strategy
and
require
counsel
to
replace
it
with
a
laundry
list
brief,
with
a
brief
simply
listing
what
may
well
be
a
large
number
of
issues
which,
in
counsel's
judgment,
would
render
the
brief
less
effective
rather
than
more.
such
a
list
of
issues
which
anders,
in
fact,
requires
may
be
better
than
nothing
which
is
what
the
anders
defendant
would
otherwise
get,
but
it
was
not
better
or
more
effective
than
a
carefully
constructed
presentation
based
on
reasonable,
professional
judgment.
the
selection
of
issues
for
appeal
is
plainly
a
strategic
judgment,
the
sort
of
strategic
judgment
appropriately
assigned
to
counsel,
and
not
one
of
the
small
number
of
decisions
that
are
appropriately
reserved
for
the
defendant
personally.
the
number
of
colorable
issues
that
could
be
found
in
combing
a
record
is
potentially
infinite.
it
is
counsel's
job.
it
is
quintessentially
the
job
of
counsel
to
shape
that
raw
material
into
a
form
that
is
easily
digested
by
the
appellate
court.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
i
think
there
might
well
be.
i
would
say
that
the
omission
of
a
particular
issue
might
well
constitute
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel
either
because
that
issue
was
itself
so
strong
that
any
reasonable
lawyer
would
raise
it
or
because
the
client's
particular
reasons
for
wanting
that
particular
issue
raised
were
so
compelling
that
they
ought
to
overcome
whatever
strategic
judgment
the
lawyer
might
otherwise
make.
my
objection
rather
is
to
this
pro
se
rule
that
makes
a
request
dispositive
of
the
issue
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
without
the
sort
of
case
by
case
inquiry
that
seems
to
me
most
appropriate
for
adjudicating
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
by
counsel.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
it
might
well
be.
there
is,
in
fact,
a
division
of
professional
opinion
about
the
allocation
of
control
between
lawyer
and
client.
there
has
been
some
discussion
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
opinion
below
about
the
aba
code
of
professional
responsibility,
the
proposed
rules
of
professional
conduct.
neither
of
those
documents
squarely
address
the
issue
of
the
selection
of
issues
for
appeal.
they
recognize
the
distinction
between
strategic
decisions
properly
made
by
counsel
and
certain
fundamental
decisions
that
must
be
made
by
the
client.
and,
even
the
aba
criminal
justice
standards
are
unclear.
they
say
explicitly
that
the
decision
whether
to
appeal
or
not
is
for
the
client
and
that
is
like
the
decision
whether
to
plead
guilty
or
not,
the
decision
whether
to
testify
or
not,
certain
basic
decisions.
the
aba
standards
go
beyond
the
code
of
professional
responsibility
and
the
rules
of
professional
conduct
to
say...
to
discuss
the
question
of
selection
of
issues.
what
the
standard
says
is
that
in
the
selection
of
issues
counsel
should
try
to
persuade
the
client
to
abandon--
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
don't
say
who
should
make
the
final
decision.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
the
code
doesn't
specifically
describe
the
situation
of
selection
of
issues.
it
specifically
says
that
strategic
decisions
are
for
the
client...
for
the
lawyer...
and
fundamental
decisions
are
for
the
client.
the
code
says,
for
instance...
the
disciplinary
rule
says...
that
a
lawyer
shall
not
intentionally
fail
to
seek
the
lawful
objectives
of
his
client
through
reasonably
available
means.
it
also
says,
where
permissible,
a
lawyer
may
exercise
his
professional
judgment
to
waive
or
fail
to
assert
a
right
or
position
of
that
client.
it
seems
pretty
clear,
in
short,
that
there
is
some
concern
about
just
how
to
resolve
this
question
as
a
matter
of
ethics,
as
a
matter
of
professional
responsibility
and
particularly
in
light
of
that
ambiguity.
it
seems
that
the
constitution
can
hardly
be
expected
to
resolve
that
difference
of
professional
opinion
which
is
to
say,
justice
white,
that
even
if
it
were
to
be
determined
that
there
might
be
an
ethical
violation
here,
that
would
not
dispose
of
the
constitutional
question.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
i
believe
they
are
cited
in
a
footnote
about
those
standards
and...
they
are
not
quoted.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
whether
he
will
or
will
not
appeal.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
that
is
correct.
they
are
cited
at
page
16
of
our
brief
in
footnote
14,
all
these
several
standards.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
would
say
that
in
the
ordinary
case
that
would
constitute
a
waiver;
that
is
that
reasonable
strategic
judgments
of
a
lawyer
do,
in
fact,
bind
the
client
and
they
bind
him
not
only
on
the
direct
appeal
but
also
for
the
purposes
of
making
the
procedural
waiver.
however,
the
fact,
if
it
were
a
fact,
that
there
was
this
kind
of
difference
of
opinion,
might
well
constitute
cause
for
avoiding
that
waiver
principle
in
a
particular
case.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
would
require
precisely
the
kind
of
factual
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
the
way
which
the
decision
was
made
would
be
inappropriate
on
direct
appeal
but
that
might
be
appropriate
on
collateral
attack.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
in
this
case,
there
was
no
constitutional
violation.
i
understood
the
question
to
be
suppose
the
defendant
were
then
to
file
a
federal
habeas
corpus--
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
--petition
raising
one
of
the
claims.
but,
in
this
particular
case,
none
of
the
omitted
claims
was
a
constitutional
claim.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
i
would
say--
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
--in
the
ordinary
case,
no.
i
would
say
in
the
ordinary
case
there
would
be
a
procedural
forfeiture
that
would
bar--
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
would
say
there
is
no
constitutional
error.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
that
is
what
i
understood
justice
o'connor's
question
to
be.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
and
my
argument
would
be
that
in
the
ordinary
case
that
ought
to
bar
federal
habeas
relief
because--
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
--how
about
the
merits
of
what?
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
ordinarily
that
would
be
a
bar.
it
might
be
that
that
particular
federal
habeas
petitioner
could
persuade
a
court
that
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
refusal
in
his
case
there
was
cause
for
avoiding
that
procedural
bar.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
then
the
federal
habeas
court
should
reach
the
merits.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
in
that
case
it
would
probably
be
the
case
if
there
was
no
state
exhaustion,
if
there
was
not
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
it
would
not...
the
issue
would
not
be
forever
lost
because
it
wouldn't
be
procedurally
barred,
but
it
would
have
to
be
reached,
the
merits
would
have
to
be
reached
in
that
case.
the
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel,
a
however,
would,
in
our
view,
not
be
a
valid
claim.
that
would
not
be
reached
by
the
federal
habeas
court
or
by
any
other
court
if
the
omission
was
a
reasonable,
strategic
judgment.
does
that
answer
your
question?
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
the
second
circuit
justified
its
rule
in
part
as
unnecessary
method
of
providing
equality
to
indigent
defendants.
indeed,
that
is
ultimately
the
premise
of
anders
and
of
all
the
cases
that
concern
themselves
with...
in
which
this
court
has
concerned
itself
with
the
right
of
an
indigent
defendant
to
appointed
counsel
on
appeal.
the
rule
is
not
an
effective...
a
necessary
or
effective
way
of
providing
equality
to
indigent
defendants.
first,
the
constitution
does
not
require
the
state
to
make
the
relationship
between
an
indigent
defendant
and
appointed
counsel
identical
to
the
relationship
between
a
paying
client
and
retained
counsel
and,
in
any
event,
that
could
not
be
done.
there
is,
in
the
nature
of
a
financial
relationship,
something
that
cannot
be
represented
except
by
a
financial
relationship.
paying
clients
have
substantial
financial
constraints
that
indigents
do
not.
it
is
expensive
to
change
lawyers
after
one
lawyer
has
already
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
on
the
case,
and
it
is
expensive
to
ask
one
lawyer
to
research
and
write
on
a
large
number
of
insubstantial
issues.
many
paying
clients
lack
the
complete
control
over
counsel
that
the
second
circuit
seems
to
assume
they
have.
indeed,
in
the
wake
of
the
barnes
decision,
the
second
circuit
decision
in
this
case,
our
office
has
received
habeas
corpus
petitions
from
paying
clients
who
claimed
that
their
retained
counsel
failed
to
raise
certain
issues
that
they
requested
and
asking
for
the
same
right
that
indigents
have
under
the
barnes
decision
below;
that
is
to
say
that
at
least
some
paying
clients
lack
the
kind
of
control
the
second
circuit
rule
would
give
to
indigents.
there
obviously
is
a
wide
range
of
control.
there
is
a
wide
range
of
paying
clients,
and
the
amount
of
money
somebody
has
available
to
him
is
very
likely
to
affect
the
kind
of
control
he
has
over
his
client
as
well
as
the
kind
of...
over
his
counsel
as
well
as
the
kind
of
counsel
he
gets.
and,
in
any
event,
the
constitutional
guarantee
at
stake
here
is
a
right
to
effective
counsel,
not
a
right
to
any
particular
form
of
attorney
client
relationship.
the
right
is
not
meant
to
provide
indigents
with
equal
control
or
equal
opportunity
for
self
expression
or
any
other
of
a
variety
of
possible
forms
of
equality
that
indigent
defendants
might
like
to
have.
it
is
to
provide
them
with
an
equal
chance
for
meaningful
appellate
review
of
their
convictions.
a
breakdown
in
the
attorney
client
relationship
might
operate
to
prevent
meaningful,
effective
appellate
review,
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
that
happened
here.
where
counsel
has
consulted
with
the
client
and
paid
attention
to
his
concerns
and
ultimately
made
reasonable,
strategic
judgments
about
how
to
frame
the
appeal,
the
constitutional
right
to
counsel
on
appeal
is
satisfied.
there
is...
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
that
there
may
be
a
problem
about
state
action
in
this
case.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
there
is
enough
state
action
in
holding
a
convicted
defendant
in
custody
to
require
that
the
procedures
by
which
the
conviction
is
obtained
and
upheld
satisfy
constitutional
standards
and
that
includes
the
requirement
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel
at
trial
and
on
appeal.
but,
again,
that
right,
that
constitutional
right,
is
a
right
to
meaningful
counsel
to
effective
appellate
review.
in
fact,
this
court
has
held
that
that
applies...
that
that
may
be
limited
only
to
the
first
mandatory
appeal
and
not
to
subsequent
discretionary
appeals.
but,
in
this
first
mandatory
state
appeal,
the
requirement
is
of
meaningful
counsel
and
that
requirement
was
satisfied
here.
the
omission
of
an
issue
then
could
well
amount
to
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
but
that
judgment
shouldn't
depend
on
whether
or
not
the
defendant
made
a
request.
in
fact,
it
would
be
peculiar
to
penalize
the
defendant
too
ignorant
to
make
a
request.
it
should
depend
on
whether
the
issue
was
sufficiently
substantial
so
that
reasonable
counsel
would
have
necessarily
raised
it
or
on
whether
the
particular
request
was
sufficiently
weighty
that
reasonable
counsel
would
have
acceded
to
it.
neither
of
those
kinds
of
omissions
is
shown
by
this
record.
on
appeal
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
proper
standard
is
not
the
pro
se
rule
set
forth
by
the
second
circuit,
but
a
flexible
standard
of
reasonable,
professional
competence
applied
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
that
standard
was
satisfied
here.
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
petition
dismissed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
little
bit
of
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
a
few
brief
points,
if
i
may.
first,
there
is
no
suggestion
here
that
there
was
a
failure
of
communication
or
a
lack
of
participation
by
the
client.
the
only
question
that
this
case
is
about
has
to
do
with
ultimate
control,
not
participation.
second,
every
point
that
the
second
circuit
said
should
have
been
presented,
was,
in
fact,
before
the
state
appellate
court
in
the
form
of
a
pro
se
brief.
so,
there
is
no
denial...
no
total
denial
of
access
here.
third,
though
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
distinguish
between
strategy
at
trial
and
strategy
on
appeal,
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
there
are
important
strategic
judgments
to
be
made
on
appeal
as
well
as
at
trial.
there
was
one
particularly
salient
one
here.
the
client
was
concerned
about
the
fact
that
a
particular
medical
record,
having
to
do
with...
by
which
he
wanted
to
impeach
the
complaining
witness,
did
not
get
into
evidence.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
yes
it
would.
ms.
miss
barbara
d.
underwood
that
is
correct.
