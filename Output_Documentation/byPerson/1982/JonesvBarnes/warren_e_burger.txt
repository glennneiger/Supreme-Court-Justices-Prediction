we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
jones
against
barnes.
miss
underwood,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
cite
the
standards
of
the
aba
on
the
defense
counsel's
functions
in
your
brief?
i
don't
recall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
very
little
left
to
the
client
as
compared
to
the
lawyer
under
those
standards,
is
that
not
so?
the
defendant
decides
whether...
alone
decides
whether
he
would
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty,
and
he
alone
can
decide
whether
he
will
or
will
not
testify
and
that
is
about
it,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
miss
underwood,
what
would
the
effect
be
in
your
view
if
we
were
to
agree
with
your
view
in
the
event
the
convicted
defendant
thereafter
filed
a
habeas
petition
under
one
of
these
theories
that
his
lawyer
refused
to
raise
on
appeal,
and
we
were
faced
with
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
a
waiver
under
wainwright
against
sykes?
would
that
be
a
ground
for
not
applying
the
waiver
principle
then
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
riesel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
the
consequence
of
that,
you
claim,
and
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
said,
is
that
there
is
ineffective
assistance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
concede
it
was
effective
assistance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
don't
you
think
we
should
be
concerned
with
whether
or
not
there
is
or
is
not
a
claim
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
the
ultimate
issue,
the
ultimate
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
put
it
another
way,
the
question
is
who
is
going
to
try
the
case,
is
that
not
perhaps
a
corollary
statement
of
the
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
trying
the
case
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
are
saying
on
direct
appeal,
counsel.
you
are
not
here
on
direct
appeal
or,
in
your
terms,
do
you
think
you
are
here?
did
this
case
come
on
direct
appeal
in
those
terms?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
you
were
required...
that
you
are
required
here
to
raise
every
non
frivolous
issue
that
your
client
wants
whether
you
think
it
makes
any
sense
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
here
in
this
court
today
in
your
brief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
you
thought
it
would
weaken
the
ultimate...
the
total
presentation
in
the
case
to
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
put
it
in...
you
would
feel
required
to
put
it
in
the
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
when
you
came
here
to
argue
it
as
you
have
today,
and
your
client
says,
now,
i
want
you
to
be
very
sure
you
argue
every
one
of
these
points,
even
the
ones
you
didn't
think
make
any
sense,
obligation
on
your
part
in
these
terms
to
orally
argue
those
points?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
you
might,
you
might
in
doing
that
neglect
oral
argument
on
points
that
you
consider
truly
important
and
crucial,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you
have
changed
your
terms
from
non
frivolous
to
legitimate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
use
the
term
effective,
although
earlier
you
disclaimed
any
thoughts
of
lack
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel
here.
you
said
the
client
was
entitled
to
have
his
pro
se
points
presented
effectively,
and
that
his
counsel
having
declined
to
help
him
present
what
the
counsel
considered
improper
points,
therefore,
there
was
not
an
effective
presentation.
so,
is
there
not
an
undercurrent
here
of
effective
representation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
your
point
of
your
argument
that
you
were
making
was
that
the
counsel
had
an
obligation
to
take
this
pro
se
brief
and
cast
the
pro
se's
points
in
terms
that
a
lawyer
would
use
with
the
skill
of
the
advocate,
i
think
you
have
said.
so,
doesn't
that
really
draw
in,
even
if
in
the
freudian
sense,
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
he
thought
one
of
them
was
a
dishonorable,
unethical
point,
do
you
think
he
had
an
obligation
to
raise
it
any
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
said,
what
if,
hypothetically?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--now,
referring
back
to
my
inquiries
about
whether
you
were
or
were
not
raising
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
i
note
that
while
it
is
very
flattering
to
judge
bazelon
and
to
judge
kaufman
and
to
me
to
have
you
cite
our
articles,
you
have
devoted
about
four
pages
and
they
all
deal
with
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view,
mrs.
riesel,
should
the
clients
rather
than
the
lawyer
make
the
decision
on
whether
to
cross
examine
or
not
to
cross
examine
an
adverse
witness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
important.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
exchange
it
on
appeal,
at
trial...
the
trial
counsel
having
been
replaced
on
appeal...
the
trial
counsel
declines
to
cross
examine
a
government
witness
explaining
to
his
client
that
it
would
be
disastrous
to
cross
examine
in
his
professional
judgment.
now,
we
have
a
new
lawyer
on
appeal
and
the
client
wants
counsel
to
raise
that
issue...
obligation
to
raise
it,
even
though
to
the
appellate
counsel
it
does
not
make
any
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
competent
but
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sort
of
a
malpractice
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
miss
underwood?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
