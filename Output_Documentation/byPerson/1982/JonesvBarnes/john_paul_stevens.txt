miss
underwood,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
understand
your
reasons
for
objecting
to
the
second
circuit
rule.
suppose
you
had
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
clear
request
and
a
clear
refusal
by
the
lawyer
for
tactical
reasons.
is
there
any
limit
in
your
view
on
the
right
of
the
lawyer
to
substitute
his
own
judgment?
does
the
client
have
any
kind
of
issue
on
which
he
could
insist
that
there
be
an
argument
made
or
an
argument
not
made
either
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
that
the
constitutional
provision
on
which
you
have
relied
is
not
the
6th
amendment,
not
the
due
process
clause
and
not
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
just
the
right
of
access
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
in
those
cases,
the
prisoner
access
to
the
courts,
for
example,
usually
pro
se
submissions
have
been
adequate.
and
here
you
did,
in
fact,
get...
your
client's
letter
did
go
to
the
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
doesn't
equate,
then
it
is
an
equal
protection
matter,
but
there
is
access--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
that
goes
to
the
persuasive
character
of
the
presentation.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
communication
by
the
client
is
intelligible
and
his
point
is
understandable
by
the
court.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
satisfies
the
access
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
know
of
any
access
case
that
said
there
had
been
a
denial
of
access
when
the
message
gets
through,
even
though
it
may
be
poorly
written
and
pro
se
and
all
the
rest.
i
understand
the
equal
protection,
due
process,
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
but
i
do
not
think
your
access
case
is
really
right
on
the
button
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
case,
do
you
think,
is
your
strongest
access
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
i
suppose
we
must
be
curious
to
know
whether
your
client
wanted
you
to
make
that
point.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
doesn't
the
lawyer,
then,
have
a
duty
if
he
thinks
of
four
or
five
non
frivolous
issues
that
he
thinks
are
not
quite
strong
enough
to
raise,
should
he
not
tell
the
client
about
the
non
frivolous
issues
he
has
decided
not
to
raise
so
the
client
can
make
a
meaningful
decision
as
whether
to
let
him
go
ahead
that
way?
