justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
since
so
much
seems
to
turn
on
this,
miss
underwood,
could
you
briefly
summarize
what,
in
fact,
did
happen?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
anders
didn't
tell
you
how
to
go
about
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
is
a
legitimate
claim,
you
shouldn't
need
to
be...
the
lawyer
shouldn't
need
to
be
urged
by
the
client
to
present
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
riesel,
your
client
did
have
a
brief
submitted
on
his
behalf
to
the
state
appellate
court,
did
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
are
you
claiming
that
counsel's
performance
on
the
written
part
of
the
appellate
presentation
of
briefing
fell
short
of
constitutional
standard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
supposing
there
had
been
no
oral
argument,
that
the
case
had
simply
been
submitted
on
the
basis
of
your
client's
pro
se
brief
and
the
counsel's
brief.
would
you
think
that
the
second
circuit
ought
to
reach
the
same
result
as
it
did
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
the
lawyer
wouldn't
sign
his
name
to
the
brief
prepared
by
your
client?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel
would
have
had
to
retool
the
pro
se
brief
to
meet
these
standards?
