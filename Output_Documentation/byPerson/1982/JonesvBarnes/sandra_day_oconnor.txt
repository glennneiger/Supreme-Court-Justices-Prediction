justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
a
preliminary
question?
the
question
presented
in
the
cert
petition
is
whether
the
6th
and
14th
amendments
require
assigned
defense
counsel
to
raise
every
non
frivolous
issue
requested
by
the
defendant.
what
i
would
like
to
ask
is
whether
the
questions,
whether
the
respondent,
in
fact,
asked
his
lawyer
to
raise
the
issues
and
whether
they
were
non
frivolous
are
questions
before
us?
the
briefs
talk
about
them
a
lot
but
it
was
hard
for
me
to
understand
that
those
questions
were
properly
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
should
we
just
assume
that
requests
were
made
and
get
on
with
the
other
issues?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
you
determine
what
is
non
frivolous
by
some
objective
standard
or
what
counsel
deems
it
to
be
as
you
suggested
in
your
brief?
