may
i
back
up
minute
to
the

still
say
you
do
not

the
6th

you
have
got
it
in
your
brief.

well,
you
say
in
your
brief,
you
quote
from
justice
shaefer,
"of
all
the
rights
that
an
accused
person
has,
the
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
is
by
far
the
most
pervasive,
for
it
affects.
"
--you
are
relying
now
on
the
6th
amendment,
aren't
you?
you
are
talking
about
counsel.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
only
point
is
that
you
object
to
the
counsel
in
this
case
abandoning
a
point,
and
you
are
abandoning
a
point
here.
am
i
right?
