ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
on
direct
appeal
from
a
criminal
conviction
the
constitutional
right
to
access
to
the
courts
will
insure
an
indigent's
right
to
be
heard
through
counsel
on
a
non
frivolous
issue
he
urged
his
lawyer
to
raise,
petitioners'
argument
notwithstanding.
this
is
not
a
case
of
lawyer
competence.
the
second
circuit
specifically
rejected
that
analysis.
rather
the
issue
is
whether
counsel
can
act
as
a
barrier
to
a
non
frivolous
issue
urged
upon
him
by
his
client.
respondent
david
barnes
maintains--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
our
claim.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
there
was
no
assistance,
your
honor,
on
the
issues
that
barnes
urged
upon
his
counsel.
in
other
words,
barnes--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
the
question
is
whether
counsel
can
act
as
a
barricade
to
preclude
his
client
from
gaining
access
to
the
court.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
well,
your
honor,
this
case
does
not
deal
with
trials.
it
deals
with
an
appeal.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
your
honor
is
correct
that
a
question
in
this
case
is
who
is
the
master,
if
you
will,
of
the
proceeding.
this
case
deals
with
a
direct
appeal,
and
we
maintain
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
the
appellate
process
and
the
trial
process.
clearly
once
a
state
has
established
procedures
for
appellate
review
of
a
criminal
conviction,
it
must
provide
equal
and
open
access
to
those
procedures.
access
may
be
defined
as
the
means
by
which
an
indigent
defendant
can
present
his
claims
to
the
court.
on
direct
appeal
at
a
minimum
the
means
to
a
fair
hearing
requires
the
right
to
counsel.
it
is
only
through
counsel
that
the
indigent
lay
person,
uneducated
in
the
law,
can
effectively
and
adequately
present
his
claims
to
an
appellate
court.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
your
honor,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
lawyer
on
direct
appeal
from
a
criminal
conviction
can
decline
to
raise
a
non
frivolous
issue
urged
by
his
client?
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
do
you
mean
in
a
collateral
proceeding?
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
i
think
the
questions
of
access
and
the
questions
of
right
to
counsel
as
decided
by
this
court
may
change
the
complexion.
as
a
personal
matter,
i
would
feel
obligated
to
raise
a
non
frivolous
issue
urged
by
my
client.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
my
responsibility
to
my
client,
your
honor,
would
be
to
explain
that
view
to
him
and
explain
the
reasons
why
i
had
reached
that
conclusion.
but,
ultimately,
if
he
were
to
reject
my
analysis,
i
believe
my
obligation
would
be
to
present
that
issue.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
well,
of
course,
the
give
and
take
of
an
oral
argument
sometimes
precludes
the
best
intentions
of
counsel,
but
i
think
advocating--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--the
issue
would
certainly
be
my
intention.
advocating
it
orally
would
certainly
be
my
intention
and
my
goal.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
yes,
your
honor.
[laughter]
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--that
is
true,
your
honor,
and
that
too
i
would
explain
to
my
client
and
i
would
urge
him...
as
i
might
add
parenthetically
mr.
melinger
did
not
urge
barnes
here...
that
we
should
relinquish
that,
but
if
understanding
my
arguments
and
the
reasons
for
my
conclusions
he
determined
that
he
wanted...
that
the
issue
was
important
to
him
and
the
issue
were
a
non
frivolous
one,
i
would
go
forward
with
it.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
well,
your
honor,
this
court
in
anders
sat
down
a
requirement
for
making...
for
counsel
initially
making
that
determination
and
for
the
courts
making
the
determination
of
what
is
non
frivolous.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
no,
sir,
it
does
not
give
you
a
handbook.
but,
lawyers
and
judges
must
make
that
decision
every
day.
when
counsel
on
his
own
refuses
to
communicate
to
the
court
a
legitimate
claim
requested
by
his
client,
counsel
functions
as
a
barricade
to
the
hearing.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
i
did
not
mean
to
change
the
sense
of
it,
your
honor.
non-frivolous
will
suffice.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
i
meant
to
use
the
terms
interchangeably,
your
honor.
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
the
higher
standard.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
by
counsel,
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
no,
your
honor,
we
are
not
asserting
that
the
brief
that
assigned
counsel
filed
was
an
incompetent
brief.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
no,
it
is
not
just
the
refusal
to
sign
his
name
to
the
brief,
your
honor,
but
to
assist
the
client,
mr.
barnes,
in
the
presentation
of
the
issues.
obviously,
the
skills
of
a
trained
advocate
will
exceed
those
of
a
layman
in
the
presentation
of
the
issues;
so
that
mr.
barnes
would
still
have
been
denied
access
if
counsel
had
had,
in
fact,
signed
the
pro
se
brief,
that
that
is
not
enough.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
exactly
that.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
well,
we
rely
on
the
right
of
access
cases
and
those,
in
turn,
your
honor,
i
believe
rely
on
the
due
process
and
equal
protection.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
well,
your
honor,
the
access
cases
are
not
limited
only
to
the
prisoner
cases.
of
course,
we
believe
that
griffin
and
douglas
were
also
access
cases.
but,
i
think
it
is
clear
from
this
court's
holding
and
from
logic
that
an
indigent
appellant's
pro
se
presentation
will
not
suffice
and
does
not
equate
to
the
presentation
of
counsel
and
particularly
in
this
regard--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
when
the
petitioner
must
proceed
pro
se,
his
ability
to
frame
his
issues
and
to
present
them
effectively
and
fairly
to
the
court
is
so
imputed
as
to
infringe
on
his
access
right,
particularly
when
standing
side
by
side
with
him
is
his
lawyer,
whose
refusal
to
raise
the
issue
communicates
to
the
court--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--no,
your
honor--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--well,
your
honor,
i
beg
to
disagree.
i
think
that
the
access
cases
make
clear
that
the
client
must
have
the
means
for...
i
think
the
words
are...
adequate
and
effective
way
of
presenting
his
issues.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
i
think
bounds
is
very
helpful
to
us,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
bounds
against
smith,
which
is
a
prisoner's
case,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
we
are
talking
now
about
barnes'
ability
to
represent
himself
effectively
as
opposed
to--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor,
because
here
counsel
refused
to
do
anything.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
but
that
is
not
this
case,
your
honor.
in
fact--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--if,
for
example,
counsel
were
to
determine
if
the
issue
were
a
frivolous
one,
the
second
circuit
makes
clear
that
counsel
does
not
have
an
obligation
in
that
instance
to
raise
the
issue.
and,
i
do
not
have
any
quarrel
with
that
conclusion.
the
significance
of
issue
presentation
cannot
be
lost
on
any
appellate
lawyer.
the
entire
concept
of
appellate
review
is
the
consideration
of
issues
properly
raised
in
the
briefs.
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
it
is
appellate
counsel,
and
not
the
court,
that
must
identify
and
advocate
the
issues
presented
by
the
case.
today,
as
has
already
been
noted,
a
failure
to
raise
an
issue
on
direct
appeal
may
well
result
in
a
waiver
of
that
claim.
given
the
critical
importance
of
appellate
issue
selection--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--your
honor--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--no,
i
am
not
abandoning
it.
i
am
not
relying
on
it
as
the
second
circuit
did
not.
i
think
that
there
are
aspects
to
the
6th
amendment
right
to
counsel
that--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--we
are
relying
on
the
need
for
counsel
to
enable
or
protect
the
defendant's
access
to
the
court.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
well,
your
honor,
i
did
not
mean,
nor
do
i
intend
to
abandon
the
point--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--given
the
critical
importance
of
appellate
issue
selection,
the
client
must
have
the
right,
should
he
choose
to
exercise
it,
to
participate
in
the
appellate
process.
an
appeal...
nothing
in
the
nature
of
an
appellate
proceeding
militates
against
that
participation.
an
appeal
is
a
deliberative,
contemplative,
and
collegial
process.
the
appellate
lawyer
must
review
the
transcript,
analyze
the
applicable
case
law,
consider
the
interplay
of
the
issues
presented,
and
draft
his
brief.
an
essential
tool
of
the
craft
is
the
ability
to
consult
with
his
colleagues.
the
exchange
of
ideas
often
gives
rise
to
the
primary
issue
on
the
appeal,
and
sometimes
leads
the
way
around
a
difficult
legal
problem.
the
pivotal
ingredient
in
this
appellate
process
is
time
to
reflect
and
to
cogitate.
and,
if
there
is
one
thing
that
an
appellate
lawyer
has
it
is
time.
for
example,
in
the
second
circuit
there
is
on
the
average
of
two
months
between
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
appeal
and
the
appellate's
brief.
it
is
my
understanding
that
in
the
state
court
system
there
is
more
time
and
more
flexibility
to
get
extensions
of
time.
in
this
regard,
the
appellate
process
is
markedly
distinct
from
the
trial.
the
exigencies
of
time
that
are
alien
to
the
appellate
process...
the
exigencies
of
time
that
attend
the
trial
decisions
are
alien
to
the
appellate
process.
therefore,
the
primary
rationale
for
requiring
a
client
to
defer
to
the
decisions
of
counsel
simply
do
not
pertain
to
the
appeal.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
because
i
think
that
in
the
situation
where...
and
this
is
the
most
frequent
situation
in
my
experience...
where
a
client
defers
to
his
lawyer's
judgment
and--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--that
may
be
true,
your
honor,
but
by
his
conduct,
he
has
communicated
a
confidence
in
his
lawyer
in
his
willingness
to
permit
his
lawyer
to
make
these
decisions.
in
the
barnes
case,
the
situation
is
quite
different
because
barnes
made
it
clear
from
the
outset
that
he
wanted
to
participate
in
the
process
and
wanted
to
ultimately
control
the
issues
that
were
presented
to
the
appellate
division.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
the
court
below
did
not
find
that
counsel
had
that
duty.
this
case
presents
an
entirely...
a
different
issue,
namely
the
issue
of
whether
a
lawyer
must
accede
to
his
client's
direction.
i
think,
in
answer
to
your
question,
that
it
depends
on
the
particular
lawyer
client
relationship.
if
the
client
expresses
an
interest
and
a
determination
to
participate
in
the
process,
then
the
lawyer
may
in
that
situation
have
the
obligation
to
apprise
his
lawyer...
his
client,
rather...
of
the
issues
not
to
be
raised.
alternatively,
when
the
client
by
affirmative
statement
or
by
silence
indicates
a
willingness
to
allow
his
lawyer
to
control
the
process,
the
lawyer
can
do
so.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
he
raised
a
total,
or
the
prospect
of
a
total
of
seven,
justice
blackmun,
and
then
ultimately
raised
three
of
the
seven.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
well,
your
honor,
that
was
in
response
to
the
premise
of
the
petitioner's
argument,
namely,
that
the
lawyer
should
be
and
must
be
in
control
of
the
proceedings
because
he
is
the
only
competent
representative
of
the
appellant.
the
power
of
response...
and
i
think
it
has
to
be
the
concern
of
this
court...
is
that
not
only
is
it
the
client
who
has
the
fundamental
interest
in
the
outcome
of
these
proceedings,
but
these
proceedings
are
frequently
flawed
or
marred
by
what
the
most
eminent
jurists
in
this
country
have
found
to
be
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
so,
that
the
bottom
line
is
that
we
are
precluding
the
defendant
from
controlling
his
destiny,
and
his
future,
and
perhaps
his
life,
and
putting
that
future
and
that
life
in
the
hands
of
the
hands
of
lawyers
who
may
not
be
up
to
the
task.
after
all,
we
have
all
seen
that
lawyers,
like
doctors,
are
fallible.
it
is
with
that
in
mind,
justice
burger,
that
we
cited
to
those
opinions.
as
stated,
the
client's
right
to
insist
on
the
presentation
of
a
non
frivolous
issue
flows
from
the
reality
that
it
is
he
and
not
his
lawyer
who
will
suffer
the
consequences
if
the
conviction
is
affirmed.
more
particularly,
the
client
will
suffer
the
loss,
perhaps
for
all
time,
of
the
ability
to
present
the
requested
claim
to
a
reviewing
court.
this
loss
can
be
substantial.
all
practicing
lawyers
have
seen
that
client
input
can
be
valuable.
indeed,
the
issue
decided
by
this
court
in
gideon
v.
wainwright
originated
with
the
client.
similarly--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--your
honor,
of
course,
that
deals
with
a
trial
situation--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--and,
that
as
i
have
indicated,
we
believe
is
quite
distinct
from
the
appellate
situation.
i
think
that
ultimately
the
client's
interest--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--i
think
in
answer
to
your
question,
it
depends
on
the
exigencies
of
the
trial
situation.
obviously,
while
the
client
has
the
primary
interest
and
consequently,
we
would
argue,
the
ultimate
control
over
the
issues
to
be
raised
there,
we
must
recognize
that
there
are
situations
where
that
is
unworkable.
and,
perhaps
the
one
that
your
honor
poses
is
such
a
situation.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
your
honor,
it
is
our
view
that
the
failure
or
the
refusal
to
raise
a
non
frivolous
issue
is
sufficient
to
grant
relief,
relief
being
a
new
appeal.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
of
course,
the
analysis
at
that
juncture
would
not
be
whether
the
issues
appellate
counsel
did
not
raise
in
the
state
court
were
of
constitutional
dimension.
the
federal
court
would
be
placing
itself
in
the
difficult
situation
of
second
guessing
what
the
state
court
would
have
done
had
the
issue
been
presented.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
surely,
your
honor,
but
in
simple
answer
to
your
question,
we
would
be
here
because
we
think
that
would
be
the
wrong
standard.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
no,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
it
is
an
access
case
because
the
question
is
whether
the
appellate
lawyer
denied
his
client
access
on
direct
appeal.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
but,
he
did
not
want
to
proceed
pro
se,
your
honor.
he
wanted
to
proceed
with
the
assistance
of
counsel.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
the
answer--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
--no,
it
was
an
unconstitutional
performance.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
no,
because
of
a
denial
of
access.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
the
question
of
competence
does
not
pertain
to
this
issue
because
counsel
failed
or
refused
to
present
the
issue.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
riesel
perhaps,
but
not
providing
sufficient
relief
to
this
defendant.
contrary
to
petitioner's
concern,
the
second
circuit
rule
encourages
lawyers
to
exercise
the
responsibility
that
petitioners
would
thrust
upon
them,
namely,
to
convince
their
client
that
it
is
not
in
their
best
interest
to
present
an
issue.
only
when
the
lawyer
fails
in
that
mission
that
he
must
present
the
issue.
the
result
of
lawyers
exercising
that
responsibility
will
surely
be
the
dimunition
of
the
number
of
issues.
when
the
lawyer
fails
to
raise
or
fails
to
convince
his
client,
both
the
client
and
the
court
will
benefit
from
the
professional
presentation
of
the
issue.
thank
you.
