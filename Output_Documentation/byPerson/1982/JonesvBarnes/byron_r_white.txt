justice
byron
r.
white
but,
nevertheless,
they
predicated
their
bottom
line
on
the
grounds
that
in
their
understanding
there
had
been
a
request?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
an
insistence.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
if
a
lawyer
refuses
to
appeal
on
an
issue
that
the
client
insists
on
would
ever
be
a
ground
for
complaining
against
him
on
ethical
grounds,
not
on
competency
grounds,
just
on
the
basis
that
the
client
should
be
in
control
of
such
decisions
rather
than
the
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right,
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
the
client
who
says...
what
does
the
code
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
even
if
the
waiver
surmounted...
no
waiver
on
your
argument,
the
petitioner's
habeas
corpus
would
be
dismissed.
there
was
no
constitutional
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
suppose
it
was
and
the
lawyer
didn't
raise
it
and
you
say
there
would
be
no
waiver,
but
you
would
say
there
would
be
no
violation
of
constitutional
right,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
lawyer
has...
if
on
direct
appeal
it
is
ruled
that
the
lawyer
cannot
be
faulted
for
omitting
the
claim,
do
you
think
there
is
still
recourse
to
federal
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
say
there
is
no
forfeiture,
they
reach
the
merits,
and
the
question
was
is
this
conviction
constitutionally
invalid
because
a
lawyer
failed
to
raise
a
colorable
constitutional
claim
that
he
chose
for
strategic
purposes
not
to
raise.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
never
would
be,
would
there?
i
don't
think
you
understand
justice
o'connor's
question,
justice
white.
i
thought
her
question
was--
--i
understand
mine
though.
[laughter]
well,
yours
is
supposedly
based
on
hers.
will
you
answer
this
hypothetical
which
may
not
have
been
justice
o'connor's
and
certainly
was
not
justice
white's--
i
will
try
to
understand
this.
supposing
that
the
defendant,
after
having
lost
the
appeal
in
state
court,
comes
into
federal
habeas
court
and
while
his
first
ground
of
relief
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
representation
on
appeal,
it
is
a
4th
amendment
claim,
and...
or
let's
say
a
5th
amendment
claim--
and
the
argument
is
there
has
been
a
procedural
default
because
it
wasn't
raised
on
appeal
in
the
state
court
and
the
defendant's
answer
is,
well,
i
wanted
it
to
be
raised,
but
my
lawyer
wouldn't
let
it
be
raised.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
way
i
understood
it
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
your
answer.
then
i
asked,
well,
how
about
the
merits
then?
you
didn't
put
in
in
quite
those
words.
[laughter]
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
ordinarily
that
would
be
a
bar?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
if
there
was
cause
for
avoiding
the
procedural
bar--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
rule
on
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
issue
he
is
presenting?
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
touche.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
still
be
here
if
your
client
had
not
requested
the
inclusion
of
these
issues
on
appeal.
they
are
positive
to
have
been
non
frivolous
or
legitimate
as
you
say.
would
you
say
it
is
equally
a
denial
of
some
federal
constitutional
right
to
omit
any
non
frivolous
ground
from
the
appeal
wholly
aside
from
whether
the
client
requested
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
defers
by
silence.
he
says,
let's
take
the
appeal.
the
lawyer
says,
we
are
taking
the
appeal.
if
you
want
to
read
a
copy
of
the
brief,
here
it
is.
the
client
would
not
have
the
faintest
idea
there
was
another
issue
maybe.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
if
the
second
circuit
had
arrived
at
this
point
it
arrived
at
and
said
that
counsel
should
have
raised
this
on
request,
but
then
went
on
and
said
that
this
requires
us
to
look
at
the
ground,
we
find
the
ground,
although
non
frivolous,
was
a
loser.
wouldn't
have
made
a
bit
of
difference.
would
you
have
challenged
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
is
sufficient,
but
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
went
on
and
said,
well
this
is
a
federal
habeas
proceeding.
we
want
to
know
if
there
is
any
constitutional
infirmity
in
this
state
conviction.
we
look
at
this
ground.
it
had
been
a
clear
loser.
there
is
no
constitutional
problem
in
it
at
all.
any
competent
counsel
would
have
left
it
out
any
way.
non-frivolous,
but
nevertheless
it
was
a
loser,
so
we
deny
federal
habeas.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
they
do
all
the
time
any
way
on
the
other
side
of
the
case.
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
courts
know
something
about
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
chief
justice's
question
must
still
stand,
then.
aren't
you
really...
isn't
your
case
at
bottom,
then,
a
competency
of
counsel
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
understand
what
it
is.
if
you
would
still
be
here
in
my
example,
what
is
it
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
did
not
deny
anything.
he
said
if
you
want
to
go
argue
it,
argue
it
yourself.
and
faretta
guarantees
him
that
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
counsel
said
no.
the
question
is
was
counsel...
was
that
a
competent
performance
of
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
a
constitutional
performance?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
not
because
of
competence?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
position
would
be
the
same,
though,
wouldn't
it,
if
the
client
himself
had
not
filed
a
letter
with
the
appellate
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
makes
no
difference
to
your
argument?
