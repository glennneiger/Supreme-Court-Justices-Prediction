justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
second
case,
number
81-825,
the
pillsbury
company
against
conboy,
this
case
presents
a
question
involving
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self
incrimination
and
the
federal
statute
that
authorizes
the
granting
of
use
immunity
or
testimony
that
otherwise
would
be
protected.
as
an
extended
oral
summary
of
the
case
would
not
be
informative,
i
will
merely
frame
the
question
and
state
our
disposition
of
it.
respondent
had
been
granted
use
immunity
for
his
grand
jury
testimony
in
a
criminal
antitrust
case.
subsequently,
a
civil
suit
was
brought
by
the
petitioners.
they
sought
to
have
respondent,
when
taking
his
deposition,
repeat
verbatim
or
closely
track
his
prior
immunized
testimony.
respondent
claimed
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
the
district
court
rejected
the
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
the
district
court.
it
held
that
the
prior
immunity
did
not
carry
over
to
the
civil
deposition.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
in
the
absence
of
a
duly
authorized
grant
of
immunity
at
the
time
that
respondent
could
not
be
compelled
over
a
valid
fifth
amendment
claim
to
repeat
his
earlier
testimony.
our
reasoning
for
these
conclusions
are
set
forth
fully
in
an
opinion
filed
this
morning
with
the
clerk.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justices
brennan
and
blackmun
have
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justice
o'connor.
