justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
if
you
try
to
use
it
in
a
criminal
case,
that's
the
time
to
stop
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
an
objection
was
made,
could
it
be
used
in
a
subsequent
criminal
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that's--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--well,
suppose
there
is
no
subsequent
criminal
prosecution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
there
is
no
subsequent
criminal
prosecution,
it
couldn't
be
used.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
does
the
harm
come
ahead
of
the
criminal
prosecution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
if
the
criminal
case
judge
seals
the
testimony,
the
deposition,
and
refuses
to
release
it?
then
what
position
do
you
take?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
know
how
a
judge
can
seal
testimony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
he
get
access
to
sealed
testimony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
he
wouldn't
have
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
therefore,
he
couldn't
use
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could
use
this
testimony
from
the
grand
jury
in
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
in
spite
of
the
statute.
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
the
way
you
are.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
only
trouble
with
you
is
when
you
say
you
can't
use
the
fruit
does
not
say
the
fruit
can't
grow.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
the
fruit
can't
exist.
all
the
statute
says
is
it
can't
be
used.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
not
expecting
us
to
give
an
opinion
that
will
allow
antitrust
lawyers
to
give
a
definitive
opinion
on
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you?
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
why,
that
proves
it.
it
was
a
dissent.
