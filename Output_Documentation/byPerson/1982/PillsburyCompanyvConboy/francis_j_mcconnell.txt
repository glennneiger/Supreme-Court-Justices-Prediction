mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
scope
of
protection
under
the
immunity
statute.
as
your
honors
well
know,
that
statute
provides
that
no
use
or
derivative
use
may
be
made
of
compelled
testimony.
the
issue
presented
by
the
petition
is
whether
mr.
conboy's
deposition
testimony,
which
repeats
verbatim
or
closely
tracks
his
immunized
grand
jury
testimony,
can
be
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution.
this
case
arises
out
of
the
corrugated
antitrust
litigation.
in
1978,
indictments
were
brought
against
a
number
of
major
paper
companies,
alleging
a
price-fixing
conspiracy
in
violation
of
the
anti-trust
laws
in
the
corrugated
container
industry.
mr.
conboy
is
a
former
employee
of
the
weyerhaeuser
company,
one
of
the
defendants
in
that
action,
and
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
purchasers
of
corrugated
containers
who
opted
out
of
the
class
action.
now
following
the
indictments
in
1978
there
were
a
series
of
class
and
civil
actions
filed
in
various
district
courts
throughout
the
land.
those
actions
were
consolidated
in
the
southern
district
of
texas
before
judge
singleton.
in
the
course
of
discovery
in
the
class
litigation
the
district
judge,
on
motion
and
the
necessary
showing
of
compelling
and
particularized
need,
released
certain
grand
jury
transcripts,
including
that
of
mr.
conboy.
later,
in
may
of
1981,
petitioners,
pursuant
to
subpoena,
in
chicago
took
the
deposition
or
attempted
to
take
the
deposition
of
mr.
conboy.
we
had
his
grand
jury
transcript.
mr.
conboy
had
a
copy
of
the
transcript.
his
lawyer
had
a
copy
of
the
transcript.
and
the
examination
took
the
following
format.
he
had
testified
before
the
grand
jury
under
immunity
that
he
had
exchanged
prices
with
dick
herman
of
alton
boxboard.
the
first
questions:
mr.
conboy,
with
whom
it
alton
boxboard
did
you
exchange
prices?
he
evoked
the
fifth
amendment.
next
question:
is
it
not
a
fact
that
you
exchanged
prices
with
dick
herman
of
alton
boxboard?
again,
the
witness
invoked
the
fifth
amendment.
third
question:
did
you
not
so
testify
in
january
of
1978?
again
the
witness--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--the
reference
back
to
the
prior
question,
that
you
had
fixed
prices
or
you
exchanged
prizes
with
dick
herman.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
yes.
i
was
the
examiner.
i
had
the
transcript.
i'm
reading
verbatim
questions--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
thought
i
mentioned
that
we
all
had
copies
of
the
grand
jury
transcript.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
in
my
hands
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
yes,
of
course.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
he
had
a
copy
of
the
transcript;
his
lawyer
had
a
copy
of
the
transcript.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
that
would
be
the
first
question.
yes.
the
first
question:
with
whom
at
alton
boxboard
did
you
have
price
conversations?
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
that's
a
more
difficult
question.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
not
according
to
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
borden
case.
the
eighth
circuit
says
let's
take
your
situation,
mr.
justice
white.
in
the
borden
case...
not
starkey...
starkey
is
eighth
circuit
also,
but
borden
follows
starkey
also
in
the
eighth
circuit...
there
were
two
witnesses.
the
examiner
did
not
have
a
copy
of
the
grand
jury
transcript.
he
asked
a
series
of
questions
which
presumably
were
areas
that
were
covered
in
the
grand
jury
testimony.
the
witness
took
the
fifth
to
those
series
of
questions.
a
motion
to
compel
was
made.
the
court
then
reviewed
the
grand
jury
transcript
in
camera
and
he
said
these
questions
are
within
the
confines
of
the
prior
immunized
grand
jury
testimony.
these
questions
are
not.
answer
the
questions
that
are
within
the
confines.
you
don't
have
to
answer
the
questions
that
are
outside.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
well,
if
you
go
as
far
as
the
borden
case,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
but
if
you
limit
yourself
to
fleischacker
and
the
panel
decision
below,
it
is
important
that
you
have
the
transcript.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
your
honor--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--exactly.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
exactly.
we
know
that
the
grand
jury
investigation
involved
price-fixing
in
the
corrugated
box
industry.
we
know
that
this
man
was
a
key
employee
dealing
with
other
corrugated
box
manufacturers
involving
major
accounts.
the
probabilities
were
that
he
had
exchanged
prices.
so
yes,
i
think
i
would
have
asked
many
of
the
same
questions.
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
problem
yet
because
i
did...
in
your
hypothetical
i
didn't
have
a
copy
of
the
transcript
and--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--well,
certainly
not
my
questions.
but--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--here
i
know
what
it
was
and
clearly,
to
the
extent
i
asked
question
verbatim
or
closely
tracking,
it's
derived.
in
the
other
case,
i'm
presuming
what
was
asked,
but
i
don't
know
that
and
it's
not
directly
derived
from
the
transcript.
but
when
the
witness
refuses
to
answer
on
fifth
amendment
grounds
and
then
the
court
reviews
in
camera
the
transcript
and
says
these
are
areas
which
were
examined
on
before
the
grand
jury
and
you
must
answer
these
questions,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
compelled
repetition
of
immunized
grand
jury
testimony.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
it
is
in
a
civil
action.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
co-extensive
use
immunity
protection
protects
you
against
use
of
that
testimony
only
in
a
criminal
actions,
but
you
can
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
in
any
action...
civil
or
criminal.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
because
the
respondent's
position
is
that
a
prosecutor
may
get
hold
of
this
deposition
where
he
has
repeated
his
same
immunized
grand
jury
testimony
and
use
that
as
a
wholly
independent
source.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
in
a
later
criminal
case.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
that's
right,
if
he
doesn't
have
immunity.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
no,
absolutely
not.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
the
question
is
could
this
court
make
the
determination
prospectively
that
that
evidence
would
be
tainted,
and
we
say
clearly
it
could
and
we
also
rely
on
the
dicta
in
patrick
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
i'm
sorry.
i
missed
your
question.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
if
there's
no
subsequent
criminal
prosecution,
it
can't
be
used.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
because
the
question
is
whether
the
witness
can
be
compelled
to
testify
over
his
fifth
amendment
assertion
and
the
court
said...
the
court
said
you
can
be
compelled
because
you
have
compete
protection
because
no
use
can
be
made
of
this
civil
deposition
testimony.
where
you
confine
the
examination
to
the
four
corners
of
the
grand
jury
immunized
testimony,
where
you
repeat
verbatim
or
you
closely
track,
you
are
protected.
and
we
can
make
that
determination
today.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
i
would
think
so.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
well--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--well,
we
wouldn't
have
the
transcript
if
the
transcript
hadn't
been
released,
that's
true.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
i
don't
think
that's
true.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
justice
rehnquist,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
test
announced
by
this
court
in
douglas
oil
be
in
any
way
relaxed.
the
plaintiff
still
has
the
burden
or
the
party
seeking
release
of
grand
jury
transcripts
still
has
the
burden
of
meeting
the
compelling
and
particularized
need
test,
and
that's
a
balancing
test,
balancing
the
need
for
disclosure
against
the
continuing
need
for
secrecy.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
that
test
be
relaxed
in
any
way.
that
test
was
meant
here...
the
transcripts
were
released,
and
now
the
question
is
what
use
we
can
make
of
those
transcripts.
yes,
sir,--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
that
simple.
what
happened--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--well,
the
showing
that
was
made
before
judge
singleton...
and
this
goes
back
to
january
of
1980...
was
that
there
had
been
a
massive
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
that
meaningful
discovery
had
been
blocked
by
reason
of
the
fifth
amendment
assertions
in
this
litigation,
and
the
judge
issued
a
memorandum
order.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
if
you
affirm,
whether
we
have
the
grand
jury
minutes
or
not
is
not
going
to
do
us
any
good
because
we
can't
compel
his
testimony.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
that's
why
i
want
you
to
reverse.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
he
would
have
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
that
situation.
but
what
the
borden
court
said
was
that
if
he
invokes
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
question
or
series
of
questions
and
the
court,
on
in
camera
inspection
of
the
grand
jury
transcript
not
released
to
the
parties,
determines
that
these
questions
were
in
fact
touched
upon
in
the
grand
jury
examination,
that
he
then
can
be
compelled
to
answer
over
his
fifth
amendment
objection.
and
they
say
in
that
situation
he
is
protected.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
no.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
no,
they
have
not.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
well,
they
could,
but
they
have
not,
and
they
have
declined
to.
there
is
no
companion
civil
suit
by
the
government
here.
in
the
folding
carton
litigation
which
preceded
the
corrugated
litigation,
the
government
did
do
that.
they
had
a
companion
civil
suit
and
they
did
grant
immunity
in
connection
with
the
discovery
depositions
in
the
class
actions
which
were
consolidated
with
the
government's
civil
action.
there
was
no--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--well,
that's
one
of
the
arguments
of
the
respondent,
that
the
fact
that
the
government
granted
separate
immunity
both
in
the
interview
statement
and
later
when
the
witness
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
and
in
the
case
of
witnesses
who
appeared
in
the
criminal
trial,
again
they
granted
it.
and
i
think
there's
two
very...
first
of
all,
obviously
i
don't
know
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
government,
but
i
think
there
are
two
very
practical
answers
or
reasons
for
that
having
been
done.
one,
defense
counsel,
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution,
demanded
and
said
if
you
want
testimony
from
my
witness
you
are
going
to
have
to
grant
him
immunity.
secondly,
if
the
government
wanted
to
go
beyond
the
confines
of
the
earlier
examination,
then
they
would
want
the
witness
immunized
again.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
yes,
provided--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--i
think
the
legislative
history
indicates...
and
this
court's
decision
in
kastigar
indicates...
that
that
statute
was
to
be
construed
as
broadly,
as
sweepingly
as
possible.
indeed,
this
court
in
kastigar
said
it
provides
a
sweeping
protection
against
any
use
or
derivative
use
of
compelled
testimony.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
so
long
as
the
subsequent
civil
proceedings
are
confined
to
the
four
corners
of
the--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--no.
what
we're
saying
is--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
what
i'm
saying
is
if
we
produce
a
carbon
copy
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
on
civil
deposition,
can
the
government
use
that
civil
deposition
in
a
subsequent
criminal
proceeding
against
the
witness.
and
that's
what
we
say
the
statute
prohibits.
it
would
be
the
derived
or
derivative
use
of
the
original
immunized
testimony
in
a
down-the-pipe
subsequent
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
no,
no.
all
we're
saying
is
that
the
testimony
is
protected
against
use
against
conboy
in
a
subsequent
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
exactly.
that's
it.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
that's
what
i'm
saying.
if
i
didn't
say
it
before,
that's
for
sure
what
i'm
saying
now.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
well,
i
don't
know
how--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--well,
yes,
i
do
not
know
people
get...
i
mean,
a
lot
of
times
seals
don't
do
any
good.
but
assuming
that
it
is
sealed
sealed,
and
nobody
gets
access
to
it,
then
it
seems
to
me
in
that
situation
the
prosecutor
in
a
subsequent
criminal
proceeding
against
mr.
conboy
would
have
a
chance
of
showing
that
his
evidence
was
obtained
from
a
wholly
independent
source.
if
he
neither
saw
the
grand
jury
testimony
nor
saw
or
had
access
to
the
deposition
testimony
which
repeated--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--i
don't
think
he
can.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
that's
it.
and
what
i'm
saying--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--that's
right,
and
maybe--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--in
that
situation
he
might
be
able
to
get
it
from
an
independent
source
and
he
could
establish
his
kastigar
burden.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
no.
no
way.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
marshall.
the
statute
and
this
court's
holding
in
kastigar
say
that
a
prosecutor
in
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
against
mr.
conboy,
one,
cannot
use
the
immunized
testimony
itself,
nor
can
they
base
their
case
on
any
evidence
or
fruits
derived
from
that
immunized
testimony,
nor...
to
carry
it
a
step
further...
can
they
base
their
prosecution
on
the
deposition
which
just
repeated
that
testimony.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
well,
i
think
this
court's
decision--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--exactly,
your
honor.
it
is
not
transactional
immunity.
mr.
conboy
always
remains
theoretically
subject
to
prosecution,
assuming
that
the
prosecutor
can
show
that
his
evidence
came
from
a
wholly
independent,
legitimate
source...
not
from
this
deposition
and
not
from
the
grand
jury
testimony.
all
right.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
well,
the
answer
to
that,
i
think,
is
that
so
long
as
the
deposition
examination
is
confined
to
the
four
corners
of
the
grand
jury
immunized
examinations,
there
is
no
expansion.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
i
understand.
there
is
nothing
which
prevents
the
defendants
in
this
situation
from
cross
examining
as
to
details
of
the
direct
examination.
we
are
assuming
here
that
the
scope
of
the
direct
examination
is
confined
and
limited
to
the
scope
of
the
immunized
examination.
in
turn,
there
is
no
reason
why
defendants
cannot
conduct
meaningful
cross
examination
within
the
confines
of
the
direct
examination.
they
can
ask
details...
who,
where,
when,
how
many
times.
they
can
ask
exculpatory
testimony.
well,
now,
you
said
you
had
this
price-fixing
conversation
with
dick
herman
where
you
agreed
that
you
would
both
raise
your
prices.
but
isn't
it
a
fact
that
you
cut
your
prices?
you
said
you
were
both
going
to
honor
each
other's
prices.
isn't
it
a
fact
that
both
of
you
cut
each
other's
prices?
that's
cross
examination.
that's
meaningful
cross
examination,
but
that's
clearly
within
the
scope
and
confines
of
the
direct
examination
and
does
not
expand
the
immunity
grant,
which--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--well,
if
the
examination
goes
beyond
the
confines
and
the
answer
is
potentially
incriminating--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--then
he
would
have
to
claim
the
fifth.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
i
don't
think
it's
that
difficult,
but
we've
gotten
rulings
from
the
court
in
this
case
before
and
there's
no
reason
that
we
couldn't
get
rulings
again,
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
very
case,
fleischacker
is
second
circuit.
after
the
fleischacker
case
came
down,
the
opinion
came
down,
we
went
back
and
we
took
fleischacker's
deposition
and
i
used
the
same
procedure
or
format
that
i
attempted
to
use
with
mr.
conboy...
asked
him
questions
verbatim
from
the
grand
jury
testimony.
on
cross
examination,
mr.
fleischacker
asserted
the
fifth
amendment.
no
attempt
was
made
to
compel
answers
over
his
fifth
amendment
assertion,
and
in
a
motion
in
limine
in
this
litigation
the
defendants
moved
to
strike
the
fleischacker
deposition
on
the
ground
that
they'd
been
denied
meaningful
cross
examination.
judge
singleton
ruled
in
pretrial
order
pto-69...
pre-trial
order
69,
which
we
have
supplemented
the
record
with...
he
ruled
that
the
defendants
were
entitled
to
cross
examine
as
to
details,
that
the
appropriate
procedure
was
a
motion
to
compel,
and
had
they
done
that
they
could
have
had
meaningful
cross
examination.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
cross
examination
clearly
goes
beyond
the
scope
of
the
direct
and
the
immunized
and
is
collateral
to,
that
is
not
a
denial
of
meaningful
cross
examination,
and
that
is
not
grounds
for
striking
his
direct
examination
and
we
cite
the
court
to
cardilla...
u.s.
versus
cardilla...
on
that
point.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
it
is.
he
is
a
price-fixer,
and
i
am
trying
to
get
him
to
admit
it,
yes.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court:
the
fact
is
that
the
government
would
not
give
immunity
in
this
case.
it's
my
understanding
that
that
is
their
overall
policy.
they
will
not
grant
immunity
in
private
civil
suits.
so
unless
we're
able
to
compel--
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
--i
don't
know
how
they
can.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
no.
compelled
repetition
of
immunized
testimony
cannot
be
used
against
a
witness
in
any
subsequent
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
compelled
testimony
over
a
fifth
amendment
assertion,
the
answer,
cannot
be
used
against
that
witness
in
a
subsequent
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
that's
right.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
it
is
too
general
a
statement.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
exactly.
mr.
francis
j.
mcconnell
exactly.
and
to
bring
both
your
points,
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
the
determination
that
was
made
by
the
court
was,
the
witness
had
no
legitimate
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
assert
because
that
privilege
had
been
supplanted
by
the
use
immunity
statute,
which
gave
him
full
protection
against
both
direct
and
derivative
use
of
his
testimony.
we've
got
a
simple
case
here.
when
you've
got
the
grand
jury
transcript
and
you
take
the
question
from
the
grand
jury
transcript,
the
answer
necessarily
derives
from
that
transcript
and
is
protected.
thank
you.
