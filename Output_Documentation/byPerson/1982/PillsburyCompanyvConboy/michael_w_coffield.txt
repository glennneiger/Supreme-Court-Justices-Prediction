mr.
michael
w.
coffield
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
although
i
am
here
today
on
behalf
of
john
conboy,
in
fact
i
think,
your
honors,
that
really
mr.
conboy
is
a
representative
almost
in
a
class
sense
of
many,
many
deponents
and
witnesses
before
not
only
this
antitrust
grand
jury
that
started
back
in
1976
and
resulted
in
one
criminal
case,
one
civil
class
action
case,
and
this
opt-out
case,
but
he
is
representative
of
witnesses
throughout
the
country
in
multi-defendant
and
large
investigate
cases,
and
i
have
represented
many
of
them
and,
as
mr.
mcconnell
has
himself,
these
depositions
have
taken
all
sizes,
all
forms
and
all
shapes.
the
panel
majority,
it
seems
to
me,
says,
as
it
does
precisely
at
the
conclusion
of
its
opinion,
the
thing
that
mr.
mcconnell
throughout
his
briefs
and
his
argument
i
would,
with
all
due
respect
submit,
has
never
answered,
and
that
is
the
court
says
there
are
just
too
many
uncertainties.
if
kastigar
reads
the
use
immunity
statute
and
supports
it
as
a
constitutional
statute,
and
as
we
have
applied
kastigar
and
defense
counsel
for
all
these
witnesses
who
are
individual
counsel
for
these
witnesses,
represent
to
them
that
what
kastigar
means,
as
this
court
has
said,
is
that
yes.
while
we
think
that
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
use
immunity
must
be
of
the
same
scope
and
we
should
read
it
broadly,
the
fact
is
that
it
is
use
immunity
and
it
is
not
transactional.
and,
therefore,
the
source,
if
it
is
a
separate
source,
if
it
is
an
independent
source,
may
well
be
the
source
of
new
information,
testimony
that
would
be
incriminating.
and
if
you
look
at
it
on
the
scope,
at
one
end
of
the
spectrum
you
have
mr.
conboy's
concern
that
if
one
has
to
wait
to
the
application
of
an
exclusionary
rule
down
the
line,
as
this
court
has
frequently
said,
that
is
not
the
same
as
the
fifth
amendment
to
simply
apply
an
exclusionary
rule.
if
one
has
to
look
down
the
line
to
the
judgment
of
the
discretion
of
a
prosecutor...
will
he
or
will
he
not,
in
the
state
of
ohio,
for
example,
decide
because
of
an
unlimited
statute
of
limitations
he
is
going
to
have
his
own
antitrust
investigation,
his
own
possible
indictment
of
mr.
conboy
and
others,
because
mr.
conboy
did
business
down
there,
or
will
some
judge
that's
not
any
longer
judge
singleton
but
some
other
district
judge,
in
reading
the
spectrum
of
questions
that
go
beyond
the
actual
immunized
testimony,
say
i
will
cut
it
here.
i
think
at
this
point
he
may
have
waived
or
at
this
point
it
may
be
beyond
the
derivative
use
concept.
so
that
our
submission
really
is
very
clear
and
very
simple,
and
that
is
that
for
mr.
conboy
to
be
certain
of
the
scope
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights
and
for
a
reaffirmation
of
kastigar,
which
we
think
the
panel
majority
clearly
did,
and
that
in
conjunction
with
the
way
the
government
does
this
every
time,
that
each
testimonial
situation...
be
it
civil
or
criminal,
be
it
interview,
grand
jury,
criminal
trial,
civil
deposition
or
civil
trial
or
next
grand
jury...
mr.
conboy
and
all
of
those
witnesses
that
he
represents
are
entitled
to
claim
their
fifth
amendment
right
because
the
source
not
of
the
questions,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
and
the
panel
majority
indicated,
not
of
the
questions...
the
source
is
not
the
questions.
the
source
is
the
answers
and,
therefore,
for
certainty
and
in
the
ability
of
the
witness
to
know
the
scope
of
his
fifth
amendment
and
to
keep
the
scope
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
statute
the
same,
as
the
court
has
indicated
it
must
be,
each
time
he
testifies,
he
is
entitled
to
claim
it
because
each
testimonial
situation
might
be
a
new
use.
now
you
take
the
one
end
of
the
spectrum.
what
mr.
mcconnell
wants
to
do
is
to
say
i
bring
out
the
transcript
and
i
give
it
to
you,
mr.
conboy...
as
he
did
on
the
day
of
his
deposition...
and
this
is
now
the
grand
jury
transcript
and
i
have
got
it
and
you
have
got
it,
and
now
i
am
going
to
read
to
you.
did
you
say
this;
did
you
say
that?
and
to
make
that
one
relatively
simple,
he
could
say
in
one
question
if
i
were
to
read
you
all
of
the
questions
and
all
of
the
answers
in
your
grand
jury
transcript,
would
your
answers
today
be
the
same
to
those
questions,
and
mr.
conboy
could
theoretically
say
yes,
mr.
mcconnell,
despite
the
fact
that
judge
singleton
in
this
new
pretrial
order
69
has
said
i
am
not
going
to
allow
in
grand
jury
transcript
to
be
read
into
this
trial
except
for
cross
examination
of
actual
witnesses.
but
all
of
a
sudden
mr.
mcconnell
is
going
to
have
us
transfer
what
is
impermissible
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
and
judge
singleton
has
already
said
i'm
not
going
to
let
that
in,
by
mr.
conboy
answering
the
question
yes,
it
all
of
a
sudden
becomes
now
more
verifiable,
somehow
a
better
class
of
testimony,
and
he
is
going
to
let
it
in.
now
the
tough
question
for
me
at
that
point
is,
and
justice
marshall
suggested
this,
can
anyone
seriously
claim
that
mr.
conboy's
one
answer
"yes"
might
somehow
be...
subject
him
to
criminal
prosecution
later
on.
and
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
given
the
fact
that
criminal
prosecution
is
still
possible
and
there's
been
no
real
argument
in
this
case
that
it
is
still
theoretically
possible--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--right.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
that's
right.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
clearly...
and
i'm
trying
to
give
myself
the
hardest
case,
clearly...
that
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
argue
that
is
isn't
indirectly,
but
there
are
a
number
of
differences.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
that's
right.
that's
my
point.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
and
that's
not.
exactly,
justice
white.
what
i
am
saying
is--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--no,
i
submit
not.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
ah,
well,
as
you
pointed
out
before,
that's
the
conundrum
and
the
catch-22,
if
you
will,
that
mr.
conboy's
going
to
be
put
in
unless
this
court
affirms,
because
mr.
conboy
in
fact,
yes,
will
have
to
say
that
he
is
entitled
to
his
fifth
amendment
right
because
it's
a
new
source...
a
new
answer,
a
present
recollection
of
something
that
happened
four
years
ago...
and
then,
if
he
is
compelled
and
he
does
say
yes
and
some
prosecutor
down
the
line
says
but
i
have
an
independent
source...
it's
a
new
yes
and
it's
today's
yes...
and
i'm
going
to
bring
an
indictment,
i'm
going
to
have
to
turn
around,
and
so
does
mr.
conboy,
and
say
well,
now,
since
it
is
in
fact
going
to
be
held
either
to
be
excluded
under
the
exclusionary
rules
or
it's
going
to
be
held
to
be
indirect,
i
now
am
going
to
take
your
position.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
exactly.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
it
is
not,
because--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--it
is
not
only
present
recollection
but
the
problem
with
it
is
that
in
addition
to
it
being
present
recollection,
the
moment
you
add
anything
else
to
my
spectrum
or
to
the
level
of
questions--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--you
are
in
an
area
where
who
knows
where
you
are
going
to
stop.
and
without
meaning
this
disrespectfully,
from
the
point
of
view
of
mr.
conboy,
we
don't
care
how
your
honors
decide
this,
because
if
you
tell
us
on
the
one...
what
we
want
is
certainty.
so
if
you
tell
me
on
the
one
hand,
all
right,
kastigar
means
every
time
you
are
entitled
to
use,
at
that
point
mr.
conboy
and
every
other
witness
will
do
it
the
way
we
do
it
with
the
government
every
time,
and
mr.
mcconnell
is
going
to
have
to
look
to
his
own
presentation
of
his
case,
however
he
may
find
it.
on
the
other
hand,
if
your
honors
say
well,
we'll
go
all
the
way...
and
effectively
i
would
submit
that
goes
back
to
justice
marshall's
dissent
in
kastigar,
which
was
effectively
to
say
once
you
give
up
the
transactional
concept
you
found
yourself
in
this
hornet's
nest...
go
all
the
way
and
say
everything
that
relates
to
the
corrugated
container
industry
from
the
years
x
to
y
is
going
to
be
seen,
and
this
court
will
so
say,
as
derivatively
and
indirectly
related
to
the
questions
of
this
testimony,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
that's
fine
too,
because
then
we'll
sit
down
and
go
for
five
days.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
well,
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
if
your
honors
come
down
somewhere
in
the
middle
it
is
fraught
with
uncertainty
and
it
is
fraught
with
constitutional
concern,
and
the
reason
it
is
is
because
what
you
would
effectively
be
doing,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
come
down
anywhere
in
the
middle,
is
going
against
cases
like
manusk,
against
cases
like
murphy
v.
waterfront...
against
the
cases
which
have
said
the
exclusionary
rule
remedy
is
not
the
same
as
the
constitutional
privilege
and
the
statutory
immunity
that's
related
to
it.
the
exclusionary
rule
remedy
is
to
clean
it
up...
de
facto
immunity...
some
judge
later
saying
well,
all
right,
mr.
conboy
went
this
far
and
now
i've
got
to
look
at
it--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--well,
i
would
pick
up
on
your
honor's
statement
of
that.
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--that's
my
hardest
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
problem
with
that
hardest
case
is
that
while
the
courts
have
made
it
clear
that
the
immunity
does
not
protect
you
from
perjury,
there
is
a
question
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
your
present
recollection
on
these
case-by-case
questions
is
the
same.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
that's
right,
and
he
is
entitled,
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
he
is
entitled
not
to
perjure
himself
again
and
to
take
the
fifth
amendment
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
it
doesn't.
the
case
is
where
you
in
fact
by
giving
an
answer,
a
new
answer,
would
be
indicating
that
a
past
answer
was
perhaps
perjury,
that
you
are
protected
against
doing,
as
you
are
from
making
any
statement
that
would
in
any
way
incriminate
you.
so
while...
if
you
perjure
yourself
within...
once
you've
been
given
immunity,
you
are
not
protected
from
prosecution.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
well
i
think
if
he
even
says
that
much
then
you
may
have
a
court
that
comes
down
and
says,
well,
you
waived
at
least
the
concept
that
your
answer
would
be
the
same,
and
now
we're
going
to
say
that
you've
waived
to
the
extent
that
now
you
have
to
answer.
my
point
in
all
of
these
examples,
your
honor,
is
that...
and
this
is
something
that
the
class
plaintiffs
can't
do
in
any
form
in
which
they've
tried
this.
mr.
mcconnell
told
your
honors
what
happened
with
mr.
fleischacker,
and
there
was
the
one
where
the
second
circuit
said,
oh,
it's
okay,
go
ahead.
well,
he
did,
and
what
happened?
the
moment
he
got
past
the
actual
questions
and
actual
answers,
mr.
fleischacker's
counsel,
as
the
maness
case
indicates,
being
conservative
and
concerned
with
the
constitution,
stands
up
and
says:
that's
it.
no
more.
he
is
now
taking
his
fifth
amendment.
at
which
point
all
of
the
cross-examination
and
all
of
the
things
that
would
make
the
testimony
viable,
usable,
and
in
the
context
of
the
defendants
in
those
civil
cases--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--i
don't
represent
them.
but
the
point
is
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
witness,
it's
cut
off.
and
as
judge
singleton
recognizes
himself
in
his
new
order,
he
is
going
to
cut
off
and
not
admit
anything
that
is
grand
jury
testimony
on
its
own.
and
so
i
would
submit
that,
whether
mr.
fleischacker's
deposition
or
mr.
conboy's,
if
he
answers
yes
doesn't
get
more
credibility,
more
viability
as
valid
testimony
by
the
mere
answer
yes
than
it
did...
and
i
would
submit--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
well,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
justice
stevens,
i
think
either
way
would
benefit
them.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
well,
it
would
be
beneficial--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--yes,
but
it
would
not
be
as
beneficial
as
the
affirmance
of
the
panel
below,
because
once
i
leave
here
today
and
mr.
mcconnell
and
i
go
back
in
the
trenches,
we
are
out
there
in
a
world
of
prosecutors
all
over
the
place
making
discretionary--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--you
bet
i
would,
and
that
by
a
court's
ruling
that
does
not
affirm
this
panel
below
is
the
catch-22
that
mr.
conboy's
put
in.
he's
got
to
then
be
on
both
sides
of
this
question,
depending
on
who's
doing
the
asking.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
yes.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
he's
going
to
come
pretty
close,
sure.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
well,
he
does
the
same
thing.
he
takes
the
fifth
amendment.
the
irony
of
that
is
that
if
you
take
mr.
mcconnell's
argument
that
it
doesn't
depend
on,
as
i
think
must
be
implied
in
what
he's
saying,
it
doesn't
depend
on
what
comes
out
of
mr.
conboy's
mouth,
then
you
have
the
reverse
situation.
even
if
mr.
mcconnell
just
fortuitously
asks
the
same
questions
in
the
same
order,
even
though
he
never
had
a
copy
of
the
transcript,
in
fact
under
his
theory
it
might
also
be
derivative
use,
it
might
also
be
protected.
but
i
think
that
would
be
a
ludicrous
result,
because
in
the
cases
like
kuehn,
in
the
cases
like
brown,
the
lower...
the
court
of
appeals
who
have
looked
at
it
clearly
have
indicated
that
a
new
source,
a
new
statement,
is
a
new
entitlement
to
claiming
the
privilege,
because
that
otherwise
might
be
used
and
the
use
would
then
subject
him.
so
that
in
fact
what
would
happen
is
that
mr.
conboy
would
continue
to
claim
his
fifth
amendment
right,
and
the
mere
fact
that
he
happened
to
have
the
transcript
in
front
of
him,
or
mr.
conboy
happened
to
have
the
transcript
in
front
of
him,
shouldn't
make
a
difference.
and
we
submit
that
because
it
is
current
recollection,
because
it
is
in
fact
within
the
very
statements
made
by
kastigar,
it's
the
effort
to
say
that
the
scope
of
the
immunity
is
the
same
as
the
scope
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
that
in
any
circumstance
in
which
there
might
be
an
extension
of
that
the
use
is
not
use
by
civil
attorneys,
it
is
the
use
by
the
prosecuting
attorneys
of
the
information
gained
from
the
immunized
testimony.
and
so
the--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--well,
we
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
we
don't
know
one
way
or
the
other.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that,
now
that
the
grand
jury
transcript
is
out...
and
that
of
course
is
the
subject
of
all
kinds
of
other
appeals
and
other
issues,
the
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury...
once
the
grand
jury
transcript
is
out,
there
may
be
people
and
there
may
be
prosecutors
who
look
at
that
transcript.
and
now
they
are
looking
at
an
immunized
transcript
and
there
is
no
use
they
can
make
of
that
because
so
far
there's
been
no
extension
of
it.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
i
would
submit,
at
least
in
the
experience
i've
had
before
judge
singleton...
and
i
think
mr.
mcconnell
would
agree
with
this...
that
the
court
there
and
the
court
in
other
cases
i've
been
involved
in
try
very
hard,
both
through
security
in
offices
and
checkout
systems
and
what
have
you,
to
make
sure
that
only
the
parties,
be
it
the
counsel
or
in
certain
cases
counsel
and
an
expert
witness
or
counsel
and
one
representative
of
the
client...
that
there
is
very
limited
access.
and
i
think
the
courts
have
in
fact
been
fairly
careful
about
it.
the
whole
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
an
effect
on
mr.
conboy,
your
honors
will
recall
mr.
conboy
was
joining
an
appeal
made
to
this
court
for
certiorari
that
was
denied
because
we
did
take
the
position
that
had
our
transcript
not
been
turned
over
we
wouldn't
even
be
here.
and
we
thought
it
was
improper
at
the
time.
we
objected
at
the
time,
and
it
came
up
through
the
fifth
circuit
on
that
issue
and
then
cert
was
denied.
but
certainly
this
goes
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
fact
of
the
turning
over
of
these
transcripts...
mr.
mcconnell
says
he
doesn't
make
much
use
of
them.
i
would
submit
that
there's
a
great
deal
of
use
of
them
made
other
than
the
need,
as
he
claims,
to
get
them
in
somehow
into
the
courtroom
in
the
trial.
but
with
respect
to
the
interest
of
mr.
conboy
and
all
these
other
witnesses,
the
principal
use
that
is
made
of
them
are
these
series
of
depositions,
which
we
submit
are
going
to
extend
and
subject
him
to
substantial
risk.
and
it
is
not
just
frivolous
and
it
is
not
just
a
mere
possibility.
it
is
a
situation
where
any
movement
down
that
road,
any
answers
that
go
beyond
that
immunized
transcript,
even
the
affirmation,
put
mr.
conboy
at
risk
or
put
the
courts
in
the
position
of
trying
now
to
flesh
out
the
breadth
and
scope
of
the
use
immunity
statute
and
the
fifth
amendment
by
exclusionary
rules,
which
this
court
has
said
is
not
the
proper
way
to
handle
it,
or
analyses
by
other
judges
and
other
prosecutors
of
what
is
indirect.
and
i
would
submit
that
that
whole
series
of
questions
leaves
mr.
conboy,
who
is
the
one
that
started
out
here
with
this
constitutional
right,
in
tremendous
uncertainty.
and
counsel
like
myself
cannot
say
to
mr.
conboy,
well,
yes,
as
the
supreme
court
said,
kastigar
says
the
use
immunity
statute
and
your
constitutional
rights
are
the
same.
his
question
to
me
is:
well,
mr.
coffield,
that
sounds
good,
but
what
happens
if
the
prosecutor
decides
that
he's
going
to
file
an
indictment
and
he's
got
a
grand
jury
that'll
do
it
for
him?
and
what
happens
if
judge
singleton
isn't
on
that
bench
and
judge
smith
is,
and
judge
smith
thinks
that
now
i've
waived
it?
or
judge
jones
thinks
that
in
fact,
yes,
he's
going
to
apply
an
exclusionary
rule
when
the
prosecutor
comes--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--yes.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
you
can.
and
the
reason
i
think
you
can,
your
honor,
is
because
of
the
exact
thrust
of
your
dissent
in
kastigar
itself.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
well,
that's
right.
but
now
is
the
chance,
your
honors,
because
if
this
court
reaffirms
kastigar...
and
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
can
see
that
if
kastigar
is
affirmed,
and
the
government's
been
living
by
it
and
we've
been
living
by
it
as
defense
counsel
or
witness
counsel,
that
each
testimonial
situation
is
entitled
to
separate
protection.
if
we
get
that
separate
protection,
we'll
testify
until
mr.
mcconnell
is
all
through.
the
government,
it's
clear
in
all
the
cases,
the
government
is
the
one
that
has
the
discretion
to
come
in
there
and
decide.
and
if
the
government
wanted
to
get
beyond
that
criminal
trial
and
made
a
determination
it
was
in
the
public
interest
to
have
mr.
conboy
testify,
i
believe
we'd
find
the
government
in
there
saying,
okay,
i'll
go
down
to
judge
singleton
and
i'll
give
him
a
petition.
and
i
am
sure
judge
singleton
would
sign
that
order
as
fast
as
the
ink
would
dry,
and
we'd
be
down
there--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--i
think
there
is.
the
application's
been
made
in
a
number
of
cases.
it's
made
administratively
here
in
town
all
the
time.
it's
done--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--i
think
it
will
be,
but
i
don't
know
that
it
has
been.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
we've
studied
where,
in
our
research,
where
the
government,
when
asked,
his
gone
ahead
and
done
it.
now,
the
other
areas--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--the
other
area,
of
course,
is
when--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
no,
the
government,
with
respect
to
the
release
of
grand
jury
information
and
so
forth,
i
think
the
government
has,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
government,
been
on
both
sides
of
that
fence.
i
mean,
sometimes
they
see
it's
of
some
benefit,
they've
got
private
treble
damage
claims;
and
sometimes
they
have
other
fish
to
fry
and
so
they
don't
want
to
do
it.
so
it
seems
to
me
they
change.
one
of
the
areas,
though,
that
is
suggested
by
the
court's
questions
is...
and
this
is
going
to
come
up
as
a
constitutional
question...
if
mr.
conboy
were
a
defendant
in
the
criminal
case
down
the
road,
and
now
mr.
conboy
says,
and
i
want
joe
gluntz,
who
you've
not
given
immunity
to,
to
be
given
immunity,
because
under
brady
he's
got
all
kinds
of
exculpatory
information,
and
the
government
says,
no,
i'm
not
going
to
give
him
immunity.
so
far
the
court
has
said
that's
still
a
government
discretionary
policy.
but
from
the
standpoint
of
witnesses,
it
is
not
wholly
unlike
the
problem
with
respect
to
defendants,
that
we
have
to
look
to
the
government,
and
if
they're
not
here
i
submit
mr.
mcconnell's
got
to
live
with
that
as
much
as
i
do.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
okay.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
right.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
as
he
did.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
okay.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
that's
my
catch-22.
at
that
point,
your
honor,
i
have
to
take
the
position
that
if
he
answered
that
it
is,
as
justice
stevens
suggests.
i've
got
to
then
say
it's
indirect
and
it's
derivative.
i
don't
think
it
is,
but
i
would
then--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--i
will
answer.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
right.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
oh,
it
certainly
is
compelled.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
well,
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
i'm
comfortable
when
you
say
that.
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
i
am
comfortable
hearing
you
say
that,
your
honor.
i
am
not
as
comfortable
when,
if
you
just
stretch
this
out
a
little
bit
more
and
you
get
a
few
more
questions
than,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
posed.
you
then
have
a
judge
or
a
prosecutor
who
says:
well
now,
wait
a
minute;
somewhere
along
that
line
we
think
the
subject
got
a
little
bit
away
from
the
container
industry
and
we
think
you've
waived
it.
and
under
rogers,
he's
stuck
with
that.
or
he
says,
we
don't--
mr.
michael
w.
coffield
--well,
if
the
judge
sits
there,
i
would
submit,
your
honors,
and
makes
a
determination
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
i
might
feel
more
comfortable
in
terms
of
what's
going
to
happen
with
mr.
conboy's
uncertainties.
i
don't
feel
a
whole
lot
more
constitutionally
comfortable,
if
you'll
permit
me,
but
at
least
no
one
else
is
going
to
be
able
to
second-guess
that
down
the
road,
as
we
can
if
we
simply
go
forward
in
this
deposition.
i
think
when
we
go
back
to
the
beginnings
of
this,
and
even
under
the
immunity
act
of
1954,
the
allman
case,
judge
frankfurter
i
think
said
it
best
and
adopted
language
in
mathie
of
judge
magruder
and
said:
"if
it
be
thought
that
the
privilege
is
outmoded
in
the
conditions
of
this
modern
age.
"
--as
mr.
mcconnell
is
really
suggesting
to
us...
"then
the
thing
to
do
is
take
it
out
of
the
constitution,
not
to
whittle
it
down
by
the
subtle
encroachments
of
judicial
opinion.
"
and
i
suggest
that
starkey
is
a
subtle
encroachment,
and
fleischacker's
a
subtle
encroachment,
and
that
the
panel
majority
said:
no,
mr.
conboy
and
others
like
him
are
entitled
to
certainty,
and
the
certainty
can
only
be
the
reaffirmation
by
this
court
of
kastigar
and
the
affirmance
of
the
panel
below.
thank
you,
your
honors.
