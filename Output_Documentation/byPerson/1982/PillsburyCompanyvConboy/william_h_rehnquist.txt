justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
have
a
copy
of
the
transcript?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
in
a
civil
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
since
the
grant
of
protection
of
the
immunity
statute
is
limited
to
a
criminal
action,
why
does
the
immunity
statute
have
anything
to
do
with
a
civil
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly.
but
conceding
that,
why
does
the
use
of
the
immunity
statute
play
any
part
in
your
argument
with
respect
to
testimony
adduced
in
a
civil
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know,
to
plaintiffs.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
all
you're
doing
is
waking
it
available
to
civil
plaintiffs
really.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
a
discovery
tool.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
the
transcript.
well,
that
would
just
read
out
the
word
in
any
criminal
case
from
the
use
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
position
you've
just
taken
would
weed
out
that
language,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
conforms
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
i
thought
you
were
trying
to
apply
it
here
to--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
he's
really
faced
with
a
choice
in
the
case
of
every
single
question
that
deviates
even
a
little
bit
from
the
transcript
as
to...
he'll
need
a
lawyer
standing
right
there
beside
him
to
decide
whether
he
should
claim
the
fifth
or
not.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
posture
of
this
case
or
this
type
of
case,
isn't
your
examination
of
someone
who
has
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
generally
a
cross
examination...
really,
although
you
are
the
first
to
question,
it's
really
an
adverse
witness.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
pose
two
possible
decisions
of
this
court,
but
those
two
aren't
the
only
ones.
you
could
get
a
decision
somewhere
in
the
middle,
which
i
suppose
wouldn't
please
you
so
much.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
second
testimony
the
guy
has
a
right
to
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
if
the
answer
would
tend
to
indicate
that
he
perjured
himself
in
an
early...
the
first
time.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
just
is
a
contradiction
in
terms,
because
at
the
point
that
the
privilege
is
claimed
in
the
civil
deposition
there
isn't
yet
any
use
by
any
future
criminal
prosecutors.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
certainly
don't
know
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
safeguards
are
put
on
these
grand
jury
transcripts?
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
root
of
the
problem
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
too
general.
if
a
witness
wrongly
claims
a
fifth
amendment
privilege--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
judge
overrules
it,
the
witness'
answer
is
compelled;
that
can
be
introduced
against
him
in
another
criminal
proceeding.
