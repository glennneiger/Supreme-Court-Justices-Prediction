justice
john
paul
stevens
to
go
beyond
that,
in
the
hypothetical
the
questions
would
not
have
been
derived
from
immunized
testimony.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
didn't
know
what
the
immunized
testimony
was,
how
could
you
have
been
using
it?
here
you
know
what
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
following
up
on
justice
rehnquist's
point
about
the
civil
action,
the
interesting
thing
about
the
way
this
arises
is
that
if
this
man
were
to
answer
the
questions,
he
is
now
arguing
that
they
are
not
protected.
but
then
if
he
were
later
indicted
he
would
then
take
the
exact
opposite
position
and
argue
they
were
protected,
i
would
assume.
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
his
interests
change
in
the
different
proceedings.
well,
the
whole
problem
could
be
solved
by
just
not
giving
out
grand
jury
testimony,
i
would
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcconnell,
in
any
of
these
cases
that
you
referred
to
has
the
government
taken
a
position
on
the
issue?
it
is
interesting.
they
don't
file
any
kind
of
an
amicus
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
point
is
he
might
get
it
from
an
independent
source,
in
which
event
he
could
use
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
suppose,
mr.
mcconnell,
that
in
such
a
cross
examination
question
it
would
be
possible
that
the
cross
examiner
would
bring
out
information
that
could
not
reasonably
have
been
derived
from
the
confines
of
the
original
testimony
and,
therefore,
that
broadened
examination
might
go
beyond
the
scope
of
the
use
immunity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
he
would
have
to
claim
the
fifth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
issue
really
isn't
whether
another
criminal
prosecution
is
possible.
let's
assume
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
whether
the
answer
"yes"
in
your
example
would
fall
within
the
statutory
language
of
being
information
directly
or
indirectly
derived
from
such
testimony.
isn't
that
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
submission
is
that
the
question
that
your
opponent
asked
of
him
was
derived
from
it,
but
the
answer
was
not
even
indirectly
derived
from
the
grand
jury
transcript...
the
information
contained
in
the
transcript.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
let's
not
leave
that
quite
so
fast.
is
it
not
true
that
it's
indirectly
derived
from
the
other
testimony,
even
though
it
isn't
what
he
testified
to
before?
you
found
out
about
it
indirectly
by
knowing
what
he
testified
to
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
were
defending
him
in
a
criminal
case
you
would
not
be
willing
to
argue
that
that
testimony
was
the
fruit
of
the
grand
jury
testimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
a
fruit
of
the
poison
tree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
you
had
a
coerced
confession
case
where
mr.
conroy
had
been
hauled
in
by
the
police
and
subjected
to
brutality
and
he
gave
a
transcript
that
confessed
to
a
crime.
then
later
on
he
was
asked
again
did
you
so
confess...
the
same
questions
you've
got
here...
and
he's
say
well,
my
present
recollection
is
such
and
such.
and
you
say
the
present
recollection
has
not
been
indirectly
derived
from
the
earlier
testimony?
you
say
that's
not
a
fruit
of
the
earlier
confession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it's
his
present
recollection
rather
than
what
he
testified.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
an
indirect
fruit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
represent
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
coffield,
the
only
interest
you
have
in
representing
a
number
of
these
people
is
protecting
your
client
from
criminal
prosecution,
really.
that's
your
ultimate
goal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true...
and
you
did
indicate
it
depends
on
the
proceeding,
and
i
of
course
recognize
you've
got
to
fight
each
battle
as
it
arises.
but
is
it
not
true
that
generally
the
class
of
persons
you
represent
would
benefit
from
a
holding
that
gives
broad
interpretation
to
the
words
"indirect
use",
because
then
they
would
have
broad
protection
against
subsequent
criminal
prosecution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
long
as
you
know
where
you
stand.
if
we
were
to
say,
for
example,
that
we
apply
the
same
test
we
do
in
the
fruits
of
an
illegal
search
or
seizure,
the
fruits
of
an
illegal
confession,
the
same
broad
scope
of
protection
applies
to
this
immunity
statute,
that
would
be
very
beneficial
to
your
client,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
sense
of
avoiding
future
prosecution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you,
let
me
give
you
this
hypothetical.
supposing
the
ohio
attorney
general
that
you're
concerned
about
gets
his
hands
on
this
transcript
and
he
calls
the
witness
in
and
wants
to
use
the
information
in
the
transcript,
but
not
ask
him
any
questions
about
it.
you
then
i
think
would
be
taking
the
position
that
he
is
using
information
that
was
indirectly
derived
from
a
grand
jury
transcript,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
there
statutory
authority
for
the
government
to
give
immunity
to
a
witness
to
testify
in
a
private
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
that
been
the
subject
of
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it'd
be
a
change
in
policy.
the
division
didn't
use
to
just
hand
out
stuff
to
private
litigants,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
antitrust
division
just
hand
out
information
to
private
litigants
as
a
result
of
their
investigation?
i
mean,
i
think
this
would
be
a
change
in
policy,
wouldn't
it?
