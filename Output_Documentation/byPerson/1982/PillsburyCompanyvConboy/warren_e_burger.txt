chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
the
pillsbury
company
against
conboy.
mr.
mcconnell,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
used
the
phrase
"so
testified".
what's
the
frame
of
reference
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
we
to
understand
that
the
examiner
was...
had
the
transcript
of
the
grand
jury
testimony
in
front
of
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
perhaps
of
some
importance
whether
it
was
directly
from
that
transcript
or
whether
it
was
from
some
other
information,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
having
copies
two
weeks
before
and
having
copies
right
in
front
of
you
at
the
time
is
perhaps...
perhaps...
different,
but
you
say
the
examination
was
conducted
with
the
transcript
in
the
hands
of
the
examiner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
along
that
same
line,
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
clearly
what
you're
saying.
if
you
had
never
seen
the
transcript
in
your
life
but
were
simply
aware
that
he
had
been
before
a
grand
jury
at
some
time,
would
you
have
asked
these
questions?
well,
if
you
were
suing
for
price-fixing
you
would.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
you'd
be
probing
for,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
you
didn't
know
that
he'd
ever
been
before
a
grand
jury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
coffield.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
put
the
question
to
you
that
i
put
to
your
friend.
mr.
mcconnell
has
no
transcript.
no
transcript
was
issued
in
a
jurisdiction,
in
a
circuit
where
it
is
not
allowed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
he's
an
experienced
lawyer,
as
he
is,
he's
going
to
ask.
he's
going
to
be
able
to
surmise
what
the
testimony
was.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
then
he
puts
the
questions
to
the
witness
which
very
closely
track
the
testimony
he
gave
before
the
grand
jury.
and
what
does
your
witness
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
get
a
feeling
in
this
colloquy
and
the
one
that
preceded
it
that
we
sometimes
meet
ourselves
coming
back.
let
me
put
a
relatively
simple
hypothetical
to
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
witness
is
on
the
stand.
make
it
this
witness,
mr.
conboy.
mr.
mcconnell
asks
him
a
question
which
is
by
coincidence,
not
by
use
of
any
transcript,
the
same
kind
of
questions
he
answered
before
the
grand
jury
and
for
which
he
had
immunity.
now,
he
declines
to
answer.
he
asserts
his
fifth
amendment.
you
have
told
him
in
advance
that
that's
the
thing
to
do.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
judge
singleton
orders
him
to
answer
under
pain
of
contempt.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
answers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
or
is
that
not
immune?
is
that
compelled
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
is
a
simpler
one.
my
question
is,
judge
singleton
orders
him
to
answer
and
says,
if
you
don't
answer
i'm
going
to
hold
you
in
contempt.
so
he
says,
under
that
compulsion,
your
honor--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--i
answer,
and
then
he
answers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
or
is
that
not
compelled
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
could
solve
that
by
asserting
the
fifth
amendment
on
every
question
that's
put,
and
go
through
the
same.
and
he
can
order...
let
the
judge
order
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
two
minutes
remaining,
mr.
mcconnell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
could
the
government
give
immunity
in
a
private
civil
suit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
thought
you
were
challenging
their
failure
to
give
it.
they
have
no
authority
to
give
it.
iif
judge
singleton
in
that
hypothetical
compels
the
witness
to
answer
the
question,
can
that...
in
your
view,
can
that
answer
be
used
against
him
in
any
subsequent
criminal
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
talking
about
immunized.
compelled
testimony.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
justice
powell.
