well,
mr.
mcconnell,
i
gather
what
you
want
us
to
say
is
the
use
immunity
which
he
received
in
connection
with
the
grand
jury
testimony
carries
over
to
this
deposition
in
the
civil
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
is
there
anything
at
all
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
intended
that
statute
to
apply
to
civil
as
well
as
criminal
cases
or
appearances
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
read
"sweeping"
as
carrying
all
through
subsequent
civil
proceedings
and
such?
