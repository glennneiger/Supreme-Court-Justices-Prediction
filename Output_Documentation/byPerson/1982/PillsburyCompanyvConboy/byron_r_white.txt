justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
were
asking
him...
you
may
have
been
reading
the
questions
from
the
grand
jury
transcript,
which
i
take
it
you
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
were
asking
him
for
his
recollection
at
the
time
you
were
examining
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
weren't
asking
him
whether
that
was
his
recollection
then.
you
were
asking
him
now,
then,
what
his
recollection
was
about
the
price-fixing.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
hadn't
had
the
transcript
at
all
and
had
never
had
it
and
you
asked
him
this
question
and
he
took
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
more
difficult.
it
isn't
difficult
at
all,
is
it?
he
would
be
entitled
to
take
it
if
there
was
a
realistic
threat
of
criminal
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
really
didn't
make
any
difference
that
you
were
reading
from
the
transcript?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
later
criminal
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
just
as
though
there
never
had
been
any
grand
jury
testimony
or
anything
else
and
that
you
have
him
on
the
witness
stand
in
a
civil
case
and
you
ask
him
a
question
that
may
incriminate
him
in
some
future
criminal
case,
so
he
can
take
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
you...
i
suppose
the
only
showing
you
made
is
that
you
wanted
some
testimony.
you
wanted
some
basis...
you
said
you
brought
a
civil
suit
and
this
would
be
useful
in
the
civil
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
else
could
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
affirm,
then
you'd
never
be
able
to
get
the
grand
jury
minutes
then
again
on
that
basis
because
it
wouldn't
do
you
any
good
to
have
them.
you
could
still
take
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
but
if
we
affirmed,
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
any
more
grand
jury
minutes
by
saying
everybody's
taking
the
fifth
amendment.
i
thought
that's
what
you
had
responded
to
in
response
to
my
questions,
that
even
if
you
had
never
known
about
this,
didn't
have
a
copy
of
the
transcript,
the
questions
you
would
put
to
this
witness
would
likely
be
parallel
to
those
presented
to
a
grand
jury,
but
he
would
still
have
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment,
wouldn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
--because
he
has
no
danger
of
incriminating
himself
in
some
criminal
case
because
this
testimony
in
the
civil
case
won't
be
admissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
it
hard
to
do
that?
they
are
asking
him
for
his
present
recollection.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
asking
him
for
what
your
recollection
was
then.
you
are
saying
what
is
it
now,
and
that
certainly
isn't
derived
from
his
grand
jury
testimony.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
you
just
had
a
rule.
it
might
not
make
a
lot
of
sense,
but
at
least
it
might
be
clear
that
as
long
as
you
are
reading
a
question
from
the
grand
jury
testimony
and
he
gives
the
same
answer
and
the
judge
is
following
it,
that
there
is...
that
he
must
answer
that
question,
because
there's
immunity.
but
if
you
stray
a
word
from
the
grand
jury
testimony,
then
you
can
take
the
fifth.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
equivalent
of
your
hardest
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
might
be
perjuring
yourself
again
because
you'd
answer--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
didn't
know
immunity
protected
you
against
perjury.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
he
said
i
refuse...
i
will
not
answer
to
the
same
jury.
if
he
said,
i'm
taking
the
fifth
amendment
because
i
refuse
to
answer,
i
will
not
answer
that
question
the
same
as
i
did
at
the
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
may
be
a
lot
of
applications.
have
they
been
granted?
justice
byron
r.
white
they've
been
asked,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
never
be
admissible
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
any
more
than
a
compelled
confession.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
doesn't
mean
you're
supposed
to
compel
him.
that's
too
general
a
statement.
that
doesn't
mean
that
it's
right
for
the
judge
to
compel
him,
just
because--
justice
byron
r.
white
--otherwise,
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
would
never
exist.
the
judge
would
always
just
order
him
to
answer.
