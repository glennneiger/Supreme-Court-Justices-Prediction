i
suppose
we
can
also
have
the
situation
where
the
testimony
is
originally
elicited
at
a
grand
jury
investigation
and
use
immunity
is
granted
by
the
government
to
the
witness
and
then
the
witness
testifies
within
the
use
immunity
at
the
criminal
trial
and
you
still
have
the
question
of
trying
to
use
it
in
the
civil
case.
now
there
it's
not
a
question
of
getting
the
grand
jury
testimony
at
all,
but
don't
you
have
the
same
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
did
that
happen
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
the
government
come
in
in
the
civil
proceeding
and
grant
use
immunity
again,
although
the
government's
not
involved?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
i
understand
it,
the
government
makes
the
practice
under
this
use
immunity
statute
of
going
in
every
time
the
witness
appears
any
place
and
getting
another
use
immunity
grant,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mcconnell,
i
think
what
concerns
me
most
about
this...
about
your
position...
is
that
probably
the
use
immunity
statute
that
was
passed
by
congress
was
passed
by
congress
in
an
effort
to
help
the
government
lawyers...
the
prosecutors...
to
avoid
having
them
lose
other
means
of
going
after
somebody
in
a
criminal
case
just
because
of
an
overbrick
of
the
transactional
immunity
that
has
been
used.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
doubt
if
congress
was
thinking
of
benefitting
civil
litigants
when
it
passed
that
statute.
now
the
danger
of
letting
you
use
it,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
in
the
process
of
using
it,
although
the
government
prosecutors
are
not
involved,
somehow
that
use
immunity
will
get
widened,
although
the
government
wouldn't
like
that
because
the
witness
is
in
a
bad
position.
the
witness
presumably
has
to
be
cross-examined
and
maybe
it
gets
wider
and
wider
and
wider,
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
government
is
losing
the
benefit
of
some
testimony
that
it
didn't
want
to
lose.
now
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
but
how
do
you
do
that
within
the
framework
of
giving
cross
examination?
otherwise,
presumably
the
evidence
can't
come
in
anyway.
