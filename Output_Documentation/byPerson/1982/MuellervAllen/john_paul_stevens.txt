i
am
puzzled
about
that
because
isn't
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute
to
provide
support
for
the
private
sector
and
keep
the
other
school
system
alive
and
to
the
extent
that
money
is
funneled
into
the
people
that
go
to
public
schools,
it
really
is
kind
of
incidental,
isn't
it?
it
doesn't
serve
the
major
purpose
of
the
statute,
let
me
put
it
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
how
large
the
deduction
was
that
they
took?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
be
$5.00
for
each
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
likely
that
a
parent
of
a
public
school
child
would
have
$500
of
non-tuition
expenses
that
would
be
deductible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
be
possible,
but
you
are
talking
about
100,000
people
in
your
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
100,000
of
them
had
a
$500
deduction?
it
seems
very
unlikely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
argument
undercut,
the
deduction
for
tuition
benefits,
for
tuition
payments,
because
they
are
not
available
across
the
board.
only
those
attending
private
school
pay
tuition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
surely
it
is
not
the
state
policy
to
encourage
non-residents
to
attend
schools
other
than
in
their
own
district,
is
there?
