justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
challenge
the
deductions
of...
the
deductibility
of
contributions
to
such
schools?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
asked
you,
would
you
think
they
would
be
questionable
under
your
thesis?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
these
deductions
subsidies,
deductions
of
contributions?
is
the
right
of
a
donor
to
deduct
contributions
to
a
religiously
sponsored
school
a
subsidy?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
what
is
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
your
submission
wouldn't
put
those
in
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there
is
a
constitutional
difference
between
the
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
could
run
the
argument
either
way,
that
this
deduction
would
be
even
more
clearly
constitutional
than
just
a
contribution
to
support
religion.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
deduction
has
to
do
with
supporting
an
educational
performance
as
well.
as
far
as
you
know,
just
deducting
a
contribution
could
be
wholly
for
religious
purposes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
subsidy,
you
say,
is
a
deduction?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
told
me
you
wouldn't
question
an
ordinary
deduction
for
a
contribution
to
a
religiously-oriented
school.
now,
those...
there
is
no
requirement
that
those
contributions
not
be
for
a
religious
purpose,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
i
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
suggesting
though
if
everybody
who
was
going
to
private
school
went
to
public
schools
it
wouldn't
cost
the
public
some
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
well,
then,
the
public
is
getting
a
benefit?
