mr.
kampf,
suppose
the
state,
instead
of
allowing
the
tax
deduction,
had
simply
given...
decided
not
to
run
public
schools
at
all
and
just
gave
a
voucher
to
the
parents
and
let
them
send
their
children
to
whatever
school
they
wanted.
is
there
a
problem
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
that.
but,
do
you
see
a
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
you
concede
that
a
voucher
system
would
be
constitutional?
