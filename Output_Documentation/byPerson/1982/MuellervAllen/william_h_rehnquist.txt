justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
understand
the
court
to
have
laid
down
some
abstract
kind
of
rule
of
law
about
numerous
different
kinds
of
parochial
schools
or
private
schools;
that
you
don't
need
record
support
any
more
for
a
particular
factual
conclusion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
found
about
these
particular
schools
in
minnesota?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
they
are
just
all
homogenized,
that
if
a
school
is
identified
as
a
religious
school,
as
you
put
it,
it
is
automatically...
its
primary
function
is
to
inculcate
religion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
arguably,
the
state
is
getting
something
for
its
grant
here
in
a
way
that
it
isn't
when
it
just
lets
you
deduct
and
it
doesn't
get
anything
in
return.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
the
legislature
feels
that
private
schools
are
doing
a
better
job
than
the
public
schools.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
certainly
a
logical
inference
from
the
fact
you
just
stated,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
wouldn't
permit
the
state
of
minnesota
to
feel
that
private
schools
were
doing
a
better
job
than
public
schools?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
involves
the
claim
that
a
state
tax
deduction
violates
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
which
prohibits
any
law
respecting
the
establishment
of
a
religion.
thirty
five
years
ago,
this
court
faced
the
question
of
whether
a
new
jersey
locality
could
provide
school
transportation
to
children
attending
parochial
schools
and
it
is
decided
by
a
narrowly
divided
court
that
it
could.
and
since
that
time,
the
question
has
recurred
time
and
again.
the
arguments
in
the
legislatures
that
the
parochial
school
people
make
are
that
the
parochial
schools
do
a
substantial
job
of
educating
a
large
number
of
students
that
the
parents
of
parochial
students
paid
taxes
which
support
the
public
schools
and
they
pay
an
addition
tuition
to
go
--
for
their
kids
to
go
to
the
parochial
schools.
and
so,
they
have
claimed
that
they
were
equitably
entitled
to
some
sort
of
tax
benefit
as
a
result
of
this
double
payment
on
their
part.
the
arguments
and
opposition
in
the
legislatures
have
been
that
the
public
schools
are
open
to
everybody,
that
it's
a
perfectly
voluntary
choice
that
the
parochial
school
parents
make
to
send
their
children
to
school
and
that
the
public
treasury
shouldn't
underwrite
that
sort
of
thing.
well,
in
addition,
the
claim
has
been
raised
by
those
who
oppose
any
sort
of
aid
to
a
parochial
schools,
that
a
state
law
which
gives
some
sort
of
benefit
like
this
violates
the
first
amendment
and
its
establishment
clause.
today,
we
consider
a
claim
asserted
in
that
manner
against
a
minnesota
statute
which
permits
taxpayers
to
deduct
part
of
the
cost
of
educating
their
children
from
their
taxable
income.
among
its
expenses
that
may
be
deducted
are
the
cost
of
tuition,
the
cost
of
transportation
to
schools,
textbooks,
and
other
incidental
items.
a
group
of
minnesota
taxpayers
filed
suit
in
federal
court
arguing
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
they
claimed
that
although
the
statute
in
theory
applied
to
a
broad
range
of
people,
its
principal
beneficiaries
would
be
parents
of
children
attending
parochial
schools
who
were
able
to
deduct
the
cost
of
tuition,
books,
and
transportation.
they
relied
principally
on
our
decision
in
a
case
called
nyquist
decided
10
years
ago.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
rejected
this
claim
and
held
that
the
minnesota
plan
conformed
to
the
constitution.
like
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit,
we
are
unpersuaded
by
petitioner's
reliance
on
nyquist.
although
that
case
involved
a
state
law
similar
in
a
number
of
respects
to
that
in
that
in
this
case,
we
have
concluded
that
the
decision,
that
the
opinion
differs
from
this
case
in
a
number
of
important
ways.
the
minnesota
law,
unlike
the
law
in
nyquist
benefits
a
very
broad
class
of
citizens.
it
is
part
of
a
genuine
tax
system
and
thus
is
entitled
to
a
substantial
deference
from
the
courts.
for
these
reasons,
as
well
as
others
set
out
tin
the
opinion
for
the
court,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
and
hold
that
minnesota's
law
does
not
violate
the
establishment
clause.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
he
is
joined
by
justice
brennan,
justice
blackmun
and
justice
stevens.
