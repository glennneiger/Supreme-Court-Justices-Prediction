chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
afternoon
in
mueller
and
noyes
against
allen.
mr.
kampf,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
speaking
of
the
primary
schools?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
primary
and
secondary.
you
say
their
function
is
to
inculcate
religion
or
does
not
the
state
of
minnesota
require
certain
basic...
the
same
basic
standards
as
for
all
public
schools?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
they
all
private
schools
or
just
church-sponsored
schools?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
a
private
school
that
has
no
church
sponsorship?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
in
this
case,
mr.
kampf,
show
what
is
the
actual
cost
per
capita
to
education
children
in
the
private
schools
or
in
the
parochial,
church-sponsored
schools?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
must
be
a
great
deal
more
than
$500
or
$700.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
figure
should
not
be
difficult
to
ascertain
and
could
have
been
put
in
the
record
by
taking
the
total
cost
of
the
primary
and
secondary
schools
and
dividing
it
by
the
number
of
pupils.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
just
talking
about
the
public
schools.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the
$500
or
$700
doesn't
cover
the
entire
cost?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you...
are
you
finished,
justice
powell?
for
the
moment.
[laughter]
i
think
you
referred
to
this
subsidy,
as
you
have
described
it,
as
an
indirect
aid
to
religion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now,
in
walz
the
court
held
that
contributions
to
churches
were
constitutional,
the
allowance
for
a
deduction
was.
now,
that,
of
course,
is
a
very
direct
aid
to
a
church,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
surely
is
a
very
direct
aid
to
a
church,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
the
churches
give
nothing
to
their
parishioners?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
blomgren?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
blomgren,
to
that
extent,
all
of
the
taxpayers
of
the
state
share,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
there
is
no
escape,
is
there,
from
the
fact
that
every
tax
deduction,
however
it
is
described,
whatever
its
form
may
be,
in
effect
spreads
the
burden
of
that
tax
deduction
over
all
the
taxpayers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
true
in
walz,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
atheists
and
agnostics
and
persons
of
a
whole
range
of
non-belief
were
contributing
to
a
part
of
the
church
who
received
the
exemption.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
making
up
for
the
fact
that
the
church
property
was
not
taxed,
were
they
not?
didn't
walz
recognize
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
pay
more.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kampf,
on
these
statistics
that
have
been
discussed,
suppose
a
case
was
before
the
court
with
a
record
that
showed
that
60
%
of
all
the
people
in
the
state
under
a
statute
like
this
were
in
private
schools,
some
of
which
were
non-denominational,
non-church
sponsored,
and
some
church
sponsored.
what
would
your
view
be
of
the
statute
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
about
my
hypothetical?
we
often
ask
hypothetical
questions
just
to
test
the
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
boston
firefighters
against
naacp.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
mueller
against
allen
will
be
announced
by
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
rehnquist.
