mr.
william
i.
kampf
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
minnesota
has
adopted
a
comprehensive
scheme
for
compulsory
free
public
education
which
is
embedded
in
its
constitution.
over
730,000
students
presently
attend
public
elementary
and
secondary
schools
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
minnesota
prohibits
tuition
and
fee
charges
for
required
educational
courses
for
students
attending
public
schools.
over
91,000
students
presently
attend
private
elementary
and
secondary
schools
in
minnesota.
of
these,
96
%
are
in
schools
whose
primary
function
is
the
inculcation
of
religion.
all
of
these
schools--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--primary
and
secondary,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
mr.
chief
justice,
my
understanding
from
this
court's
prior
rulings
in
lemon
and
nyquist
was
that
the
court
believes
that
the
primary
function
of
a
religious
school
is
to
inculcate
religion
through
the
educational
process.
and,
i
am
simply
giving--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--mr.
justice
rehnquist,
my
understanding
is
that
the
96
%
of
the
private
school
students
who
attend
religious
schools
are
schools
that
identify
themselves
as
religious
schools,
and
as
i
believe
the
court
previously
found,
those
schools'
primary
function
then
is
to
teach
religion.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
no.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
yes,
i
believe
that
would
be
the
teaching
that
i
have
taken
from
the
court's
decision
in
lemon
and
nyquist.
the
statute
in
question
permits
parents
of
both
public
school
children
who
do
not
incur
tuition
and
parents
of
sectarian
school
children
who
do
to
deduct
expenses
incurred
for
tuition
up
to
$500
for
grades
k
through
6,
$700
for
grades
7
through
12
from
their
taxable
income.
in
addition,
deduction
for
textbook
and
transportation
expenses
are
permitted
even
though
minnesota
already
provides
equal
amounts
of
textbooks
and
transportation
to
students
in
both
public
and
parochial
schools.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
refer
to
parochial
schools
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
it
is
such
a
high
percentage,
that
is
to
say
the
96
%,
that
the
remaining
4
%,
which
would
be
deemed
to
be
non-sectarian,
would
pay
out
until
insignificance.
obviously
by
that
i
mean
all
private
school
students--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--they
would
receive
the
same
benefits
as
those
that
have
church
sponsorship.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
the
original
was
$200.
it
was
changed
in
1976
to
the
present
levels
of
$500
and
$700.
however,
there
have
been
bills
in
every
biennial
session
of
the
legislature
since
to
increase
it
as
much
as
100
%
from
that
level.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
they
have
only
carried
one
house
at
a
time
up
to
this
date,
mr.
justice
powell.
the
total
of
tuition
and
fees
paid
to
public
schools
in
minnesota
by
over
800,000
students
in
the
fiscal
year
78-79
was
approximately
$2
million.
this
would
include
driver
education
charges.
the
total
of
other
fees
paid
to
the
public
schools
in
that
year,
some
of
which
would
be
deductible
and
some
of
which
would
not,
was
only
approximately
$900,000.
by
contrast,
the
total
amount
deducted
under
the
statute
in
that
same
year
was
over
$19
million.
the
only
other
deductible
expenses,
other
than
the
$2.9
million
i
previously
alluded
to
for
public
school
students'
families,
would
be
relatively
minor
amounts
such
as
pencils,
supplies,
and
athletic
equipment.
this
statute
represents
an
attempt
to
do
that
which
this
court
has
previously
prohibited
in
the
lemon
and
nyquist
cases.
the
statute
advances
religion
in
that
its
effect
is
to
subsidize
an
activity
intented
to
inculcate
religion.
petitioners
ask
the
court
to
simply
apply
controlling
constitutional
standards
firmly
rooted
in
prior
decisions
as
set
forth
in
the
nyquist
case.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
no,
that
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
not--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--as
i
would
indicate
later
in
my
argument,
mr.
justice,
the
deduction
of
a
contribution
which
comes
out
of
volunteerism
is
vastly
different
than
a
deduction
of
a
fee
for
a
service.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
i
don't
believe
that
this
case
in
any
way
affects
that
and
i
don't
believe
that
deductibility
of
the
contribution
to
the
school
would
be
in
question,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
no.
this
only
relates
to
a
fee
for
a
service.
this
case,
we
believe,
is--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--a
vast
difference.
i
think
that
the
court
in
nyquist
seemed
to
indicate
that
a
deduction
for
a
fee
for
a
service
is
a
direct
subsidy
of
the
service
itself
not
unlike
the
deduction
for
medical
services
which
is
clearly
a
subsidy
of
good
health
services.
the
distinction
was
in
the
prohibition--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--the
difference--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--the
distinction
between
a
deduction
for
a
fee
for
service
and
the
deduction
for
a
voluntary
giving
is
in
the
quid
pro
quo;
that
is
to
say
the
donor
receives
back
the
religiously-oriented
educational
services
which
would
not
be
present
in
the
voluntary
contribution.
the
voluntary
contribution,
there
is
no
quid
pro
quo
whatsoever.
we
believe
that
there
are
four
ways
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
nyquist,
lemon,
and
tilton.
first,
the
effect
of
this
statute
is
entirely
disproportionate
and
overwhelming
in
its
benefit
to
religious
education.
second,
it
violates
the
establishment
clause
due
to
the
unrestricted
nature
of
the
subsidy
inherent
in
the
law.
third,
as
in
nyquist,
it
violates
the
establishment
clause
because
it
permits
a
deduction
of
a
fee
for
a
specific
service
which
is
inherently
religious.
and,
fourth
and
lastly,
like
the
aid
in
nyquist
and
lemon,
it
would
require
an
impermissible
entanglement
of
the
state
in
religion,
both
in
order
to
administer
and
fund
it
within
constitutional
limits.
with
regard
to
disproportionality,
the
benefits
of
this
statute
flow
disproportionately
to
students
attending
parochial
schools.
since
common
sense
dictates
that
the
major
educational
expense
is
tuition,
minnesota's
equivalent
of
tuition
for
public
schools
is
its
foundation
aids
which
this
year
are
over
$1400
per
pupil.
as
can
be
seen
from
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
overwhelmingly
largest
form
of
aid
in
this
case
is
the
deduction
for
tuition.
this
deduction
is
analytically
indistinguishable
from
the
aid
allowed
in
nyquist.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
that
case
is
not
before
the
court
and--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--i
believe
that
presents
some
very
substantial,
different
and
more
sophisticated
problems
than
this
case.
in
the
first
instance,
the
fact
that
the
minnesota
constitution
requires
a
free
public
education
for
those
who
desire
it
is,
i
believe,
distinguishable
under
the
circumstances
since
it
does
not
require
the
funding
of
private
or
religious
school
education.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
no,
i
would
not.
i
believe
that
the
voucher
system
would
have
the
same
effect
in
minnesota
as
the
deduction;
that
is
to
say
the
funding
primarily
of
religious
education.
as
the
state's
own
revenue
analyses
from
1976,
1978,
and
1980
indicate,
the
state
has
known
throughout
that
the
primary
benefit
under
this
statute
is
the
tuition
deduction.
although
minnesota
points
to
a
broad
class
that
benefits
in
theory
from
the
deduction,
the
deductible
non-tuition
expenses
are
plainly
insignificant
in
relation
to
tuition.
as
the
first
circuit
indicated
in
the
norberg
case,
they
are
a
mere
window
dressing.
any
lack
of
evidence
on
this
point
results
from
the
choice
by
the
state
not
to
require
taxpayers
to
disclose
the
specific
nature
of
the
expenses
deducted
as
the
forms
appended
to
the
briefs
make
quite
clear.
even
without
that
information,
however,
the
facial
availability
of
the
tuition
deduction
only
puts
sectarian
students
into
a
very
small
number
of
non-sectarian
private
school
students
suffices
to
establish
impermissible
effect
under
nyquist.
with
regard
to
the
lack
of
restrictions
on
the
aid,
the
subsidy
resultant
from
this
deduction
is
without
restriction
and
thereby
falls
afoul
of
the
limits
created
in
lemon
and
nyquist.
the
flaw
lies
in
the
availability
of
the
aid
for
diversion
to
religious
uses
such
as
the
repair
of
school
chapels
as
was
true
in
nyquist.
even
when
the
aid
is
permitted,
as
this
court
permitted
in
tilton,
requirements
have
been
made
that
no
tax
monies
flow
to
religious
activities
as
in
the
striking
down
of
the
20-year
limitation
in
that
case.
even
a
subsidy
neutral
on
its
face
must
be
restricted
when
granted
to
a
religious
institution,
a
limitation
which
this
statute
fails
to
meet.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
that
is
correct.
it
is
a
subsidy
in
the
form
of
a
deduction
from
tax.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
well,
as
i
indicated,
to
not
tax
under
those
circumstances
is
the
same
as
to
not
tax
any
other
idiohomogenary
contribution.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
but,
here,
there
is
an
exchange
in
effect
then.
the
deduction
under
the
statute
is
a
discount
or
a
rebate
on
tuition.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
public
schools
in
minnesota,
i
believe,
are
open
to
all
people.
all
children
in
the
state
must
receive,
by
the
constitution
of
minnesota,
a
free
public
education.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
well,
i
think
the
question--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--no,
of
course
not.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
that
is
an
indirect
benefit
which
i
think
the
first
amendment
requires
the
public
to
bear
by
having
free
public
schools.
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
that
restricts
the
deductibility
of
field
trips,
tests,
maps,
globes,
instruction
materials
or
religious
instruction
itself
through
the
tuition
deduction.
to
allow
this
pirouette
around
lemon
and
nyquist
is
to
render
them
meaningless.
just
as
states
may
not
provide
direct
aid
to
religious
schools,
they
may
not
provide
such
aid
indirectly
by
tax
deductions
and
credits,
as
i
believe
nyquist
so
firmly
held.
with
regard
to
the
fee
for
service,
i
believe
that
the
court
held
in
nyquist
the
deduction
of
fees
for
services
is
a
direct
subsidy
of
the
service,
as
i
indicated
previously,
in
effect,
a
discount
or
rebate.
this
is,
i
believe,
directly
analogous
to
the
medical
services
deduction
which
parenthetically
congress
has
recently
reduced
in
order
to
reduce
the
amount
of
medical
care
consumed.
the
comparison
would
be
to
take
the
other
forms
of
medical
subsidy
and
compare
them
to
that
form
of
subsidy
for
religion
present
here.
that
is
to
say
medicare
and
medicaid
are
direct
subsidies
of
health
services.
if
the
state
of
minnesota
were
to
fund
a
program
similar
to
medicare
and
medicaid
for
religious
education,
quite
clearly
under
the
lemon
case
this
court
would
strike
it
down.
the
effect
then
of
this
statute
is
the
same
as
in
nyquist;
that
is
to
say
the
taxpayer
acts
in
either
case
in
anticipation
of
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
deduction,
thereby
subsidizing
attendance
at
a
religious
school
by
deducting
the
fees
charged
for
it.
lastly,
this
deduction
impermissibly
entangles
the
state
in
religion
in
two
ways.
first,
if
the
state
were
to
undertake
the
duty
tilton
and
lemon
establish
of
insuring
that
expenses
deducted
are
not
for
services
or
materials
used
in
the
teaching
of
religious
tenants,
then
comprehensively
entangling
audits
of
tax
returns
would
be
required,
a
task
the
state
has
quite
obviously
already
failed
at
as
even
a
cursory
examination
of
the
minnesota
tax
returns
were
revealed.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
the
only
thing
we
have
in
the
record
would
be
the
national
averages
of
$500
to
$700
in
tuition,
not
the
actual
cost,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
don't
have
anything
in
the
record
with
regard
to
the
actual
cost
of
such--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--i
would
assume
so
or
they
wouldn't
be
receiving
much
of
an
education,
i
imagine.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
unfortunately
with
regard
to
private
schools,
i
don't
believe
that
information--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--oh
!
in
the
public
schools,
the
foundation
aids
this
year
in
minnesota
are
approximately
$1400.
it
is
actually
called
a
pupil
unit.
so,
we
can
surmise
that
the
expense
of
education
in
the
public
schools
was
something
slightly
in
excess
of
that
number.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
no.
no
more
so
than
the
subsidies
present
in
lemon
or
in
the
repair
subsidies
present
in
the
nyquist
case.
the
tuition
deduction
itself
does
not
permit
examination
of
the
cost
as
i
indicated
was
true
in
lemon
and
nyquist,
without
entering
into
an
investigation
of
the
school
itself,
a
procedure
which
i
believe
would
be
more
damaging
to
the
religious
function
of
the
school
than
it
would
be
to
the
state.
similarly,
since
the
textbook
and
transportation
expense
is
deductible
or
for
expenses
over
and
above
those
already
provided
equally
to
public
and
private
school
children
and
since
the
state
of
minnesota
prohibits
charging
for
textbooks
in
the
public
schools,
the
textbook
and
transportation
deductions
may
well
be
for
something
beyond
secular
needs
of
the
students.
again,
without
entanglingly
audits
which
the
state
does
not
undertake,
an
impermissible
danger
exists
that
the
state
is
aiding
religious
activities
despite
the
facial
prohibitions
of
this
statute.
the
second
form
of
entanglement
is
with
regard
to
politics.
the
state
of
minnesota
has
been
undergoing
a
fiscal
crisis.
during
the
past
year,
the
minnesota
legislature
has
had
to
cut
aid
to
public
schools
twice.
despite
those
substantial
cuts,
this
deduction
and
the
subsidy
inherent
from
it
has
not
been
affected
in
any
way.
as
i
indicated
previously,
in
every
legislative
session--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--that
is
quite
possible.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
i
assume
it
is
quite
possible,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
the
first
amendment
would
permit
that.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
to
fund
them
is
what
i
am
discussing,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
the
record
of
this
case
or
any
other
case--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--that...
obviously,
if
all
the
parochial
and
private
schools
of
the
state
of
minnesota
or
of
any
other
state
closed,
it
would
cause
great
economic
hardship
on
the
state.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
i
don't
think--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--that
was
in
1978.
i
believe
that
the
costs
more
recently...
the
last
numbers
that
i
saw
of
an
estimate
were
$15
million
for
the
biennium
that
is
presently
going
to
end
june
30th.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
yes.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
that
was
the
loss
of
taxes
in
1978.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
for
biennium.
that
is
for
two
years.
minnesota
operates
fiscally
on
a
biennium.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
i
am
not
sure
of
that,
mr.
justice
powell.
i
believe
it
is
in
the
billions.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
in
excess
of
$1400.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
i
don't
have
those
figures.
the
only
figures
that
we
have
available
are
for
the
period
from
1976
to
the
present
and
during
that
period
of
time
they
appeared
to
have
increased
substantially.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
well,
the
numbers
in
sectarian
schools
appear
to
have
remained
stable,
slightly
risen,
from
85,000
to
91,000,
while
the
number
of
students
attending
public
schools
between
1978
and
the
present
have
reduced
from...
i
think
it
was
815,000
to
730,000.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
no,
i
do
not
have
any
knowledge
of
what
was
true
in
1956.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
yes,
i
am
sure
that
they
would.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
i
believe
that
the
state
has
an
important
interest
in
not
being
hostile
to
the
continued
existence
of
private
and
parochial
schools.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
i
believe
that
is
what
the
court
held
in
nyquist;
that
there
should
not
be
any
hostility
to
the
continued
existence
of
those
schools.
and,
where
aid
was
possible
in
a
mutual
fashion,
not
true
in
this
statute,
as
was
true
in
everson
and
allen.
i
think
the
distinction
between
this
statute
and
everson-allen
deductions
is
quite...
a)
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
fact
that
in
the
marburger
case,
summarily
affirmed
by
this
court,
a
subsidy
in
dollars
for
textbooks
was
disallowed
because
there
was
no
control,
no
guarantee
of
secular
nature
of
the
aid.
that
certainly
is
not
present
in
this
statute.
there
is
no
guarantee.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
well,
it
is
a
direct
aid
in
the
sense
of
it
being
a
discount
or
rebate
on
the
cost
of
religious
school
education.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
well,
as
i
understood
walz,
it
was
an
exemption
from
property
tax
of
the
church
buildings
itself.
i
think
the
distinction
between
the
walz
exemption
and
the
deduction
of
user
fee
here
lies,
as
i
indicated,
with
the
fact
that
walz
was
dealing
with
a
historically
embedded,
more
than
200
years
of
history,
of
non-hostility
and
protection
of
church
and
other
idiohomogenary
institutions
from
hostile
taxation.
this
is
not
the
same.
this
is--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--well,
again,
the
distinction
lies
in
the
giver.
here,
there
is
an
exchange,
a
quid
pro
quo
between
the
giver
of
the
money
who
receives
through
their
child
a
service,
religious
education.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
well,
i
don't
know
that
it
is
something
that
the
courts
of
the
united
states
have
ever
measured
nor
one
that
one
could
place
in
a
quid
pro
quo;
that
is
to
say
an
exchange.
at
least
i
don't
believe
that
any
religion
thus
far
has
indicated
it
is
an
exchange
dollar
for
dollar
for
some
service.
i
think
that
what
we
are
discussing
here
is
an
exact
dollar
for
dollar,
in
effect,
service;
that
is
to
say
the
religious
education
flows
to
the
child
of
the
giver
of
the
dollars
who
then
deducts
them.
i
think
it
is
more
analogous
to
the
medical
deduction
or
home
interest
deduction.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
well,
at
that
point,
one
would
have
to
determine
whether
the
primary
effect
of
the
statute
was,
indeed,
to
aid
the
religious
schools.
that
is
not
the
facts
before
us
and
i
believe
that
the
question
is
capability
of
diversion
and
restriction
or
lack
of
it
in
the
statute.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
as
i
recall,
the
same
question
was
asked
in
the
nyquist
argument
and
i
think
the
answer
is
less
than
comforting
since
i
am
not
sure
that
that
hypothetical
exists.
nevertheless,
ultimately,
since
there
is
no
restriction
on
the
subsidy
inherent
in
the
statute,
it
runs
into
the
same
problem,
which
is
that
it
is
capable
of
diversion
to
religious
function.
speaking
of
the
deductions,
i
should
point
out
that
the
table,
which
is
appended
to
the
state's
brief,
has
an
analysis
of
the
number
of
returns
by
amount
of
deduction
appended
to
it
and
that
a
clear
reading
of
that
same
table,
as
we
indicated
in
footnote
three
of
our
reply
brief,
indicates
that
the
greatest
proportion
of
the
dollars
deducted
was
in
the
higher
dollar
ranges,
thereby
benefiting,
quite
obviously,
tuition.
there
were,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
indicated,
a
large
number
of
returns
taking
small
numbers
of
tuitions,
tuition
deductions.
this
is
quite
clearly
analogous
to
the
wolman
decision
where
the
court
sorted
amongst
kind
of
aid
as
in
meek
and
disallowed
some
and
allowed
others.
the
tuition
deduction
itself
must
clearly
fall
because
it
is
a
benefit
to
the
religious
institutions.
it
is
a
subsidy.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
if
by
that,
mr.
justice
powell,
you
are
asking
for
an
exact
analytical,
statistical
study,
obviously
that
is
not
available.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
well,
the
answer--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--i
believe--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--the
fact
that
there
has
been
an
increase
in
students
at
religious
schools
while
there
has
been
a
decrease
in
students
at
public
schools
can
lead
one
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
but,
that
was
before
the
large
increase
in
this
statute
which
resulted
after
this
court's
decision
in
nyquist
and
the
subsequent
decision
in
the
minnesota
supreme
court
struck
down
a
nyquist
kind
of
statute
in
minnesota.
so,
the
comparisons
are
difficult
to
make.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
i
think
that
is
the
only
evidence
we
have
in
the
record
before
us.
mr.
william
i.
kampf
that
question
is
an
academic
one.
it
is
very
difficult
to
answer
because
we
cannot--
mr.
william
i.
kampf
--because
we
cannot
determine
what
the
minnesota
legislature
would
do
if
there
was
a
substantial
reduction.
the
politics
of
funding
of
education
are
obviously
a
delicate
balance
of
taxation
and
expenditure.
to
say
that
the
legislature
would
not
simply
appropriate
more
money
were
there
fewer
students
in
the
parochial
schools
is
an
academic
exercise
that
we
cannot
answer
here
today.
what
we
do
know
is
that
if
walz
is
to
govern
this
case,
then
this
court's
decisions
in
lemon,
meek,
and
wolman
are
rendered
meaningless.
i
have
completed
my
time.
thank
you
very
much.
