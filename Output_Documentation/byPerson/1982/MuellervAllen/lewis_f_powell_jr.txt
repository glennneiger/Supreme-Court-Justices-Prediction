mr.

you
suggested
the
financial
crisis
in

would
that

be
benefited
or
augmented
if
all
the
parochial

were
closed
up?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
does
your
common
sense
tell
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but,
you
were
talking
about
a
financial
crisis
contributed
to
these
deductions.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
cost
the
state
$2,400,000
did
you
say?
what
is
the
annual
cost?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
in
loss
of
taxes
to
the
state?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
is
the
two
million
four?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
they

in

of

what
percentage

when
this

enacted?
justice

what
do

mean
by
substantially?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
know
what
the
figures
were,
do
you
have
an
estimate
in

justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
annual
reports
of
the
state
board
of
education
would
show,
wouldn't
they?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
agree
that
the
state
has
a
substantial
interest
in
the
preservation
of
non-public
schools
to
afford
a
choice?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
what
nyquist
said?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
the

information?
justice

f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
the
operating

expenditures?
justice
lewis
f.

do
the

state
general
revenue
funds?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
also
have
federal
funds?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
kampf,
under
the
lemon
test,
as
i
recall,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
primary
effect
that
benefits
or
furthers
an
establishment
of
religion.
would
you
tell
us
exactly
what
benefit
an
establishment
of
religion
has
experienced
under
this
statute
and
then
compare
it
with
the
benefit
the
state
itself
has
enjoyed
as
a
result
of
helping
to
support
private
schools?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
record
back
you
up
in
your
claim
that
there
was
a
primary
effect?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
a
primary
effect
of
furthering
an
establishment
of
religion?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
which
one?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but,
counsel...
your
friend
on
the
other
side
says
that
there
has
been
a
decrease
since
'56.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
your
answer
is
that
the
increased
number
of
pupils
in
the
sectarian
schools?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
that
is
a
greater
benefit
to
the
religious
entities
than
the
state
has
experienced
financially
and
in
providing
some
sort
of
option
to
parents
who
wish
to
have
an
option?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
is
it
academic
in
this
case?
