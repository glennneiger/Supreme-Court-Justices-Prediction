justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
you
are
not
asking
that
nyquist
be
overruled?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
would
like
to
have
you
explain
the
differences
between
this
case
and
nyquist.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
one
can
certainly
say
that
that
was
true
here
at
least
indirectly.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
explain
that,
then.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
the
rich
man's
son
who
goes
to
st.
paul's
academy
in
your
city
gets
the
same
benefit
on
his
parents'
return?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
let
me
ask
you
something
about
your
textbook
deduction.
actually
you
had
most
of
this
under
allen
anyway,
didn't
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then,
your
minnesota
deduction
really
gives
the
parent
on
the
textbook
end
something
that
he
wouldn't
have
had
under
allen?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but,
what
bothers
me
with
the
argument
on
both
sides
is
it
seems
to
me
you
are
arguing
statistics
and
i
think
we
really
ought
to
be
arguing
basic
principles.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
may
i
get
back
to
my
question
about--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--no,
about
allen.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--and
the
additional
items
which
your
statute
gives
that
you
don't
already
have
under
allen.
and,
my
second
question,
of
course,
there
is
is
it
not
then
benefiting
parochial
school
students?
