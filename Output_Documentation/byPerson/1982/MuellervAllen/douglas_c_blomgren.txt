mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
by
exempting
that
portion
of
a
taxpayer's
income
which
has
been
devoted
to
the
general
educational
expenses
of
his
or
her
children.
the
state
of
minnesota
has
adopted
legislation
respecting
the
establishment
of
religion.
the
statute
was
adopted
in
1955
and,
as
mr.
justice
powell's
questions
elicited,
it
was
amended
in
1976
to
include
within
the
ambit
of
the
deductions
certain
textbooks
and
materials
which
before
that
time
were
not
covered
by
the
deduction.
it
was
again
amended
in
1978
to
assure
that
the
deduction
was
taken
for
those
expenses
related
to
curricular
activities
rather
than
extracurricular
activities.
the
challenged
deduction
does
not
result
in
a
straight
$500
benefit
or
a
straight
$700
benefit,
rather
it
constitutes
a
deduction
against
the
income
of
a
taxpayer
in
calculating
taxable
income.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--certainly
they
do.
certainly
they
do.
and,
it
is
that
broad
class
of
beneficiaries
which
we
have
said
is
a
crucial
part
of
this
particular
deduction.
it
was
that
point
which
was
relied
upon
by
the
three
judge
district
panel
which
upheld
this
statute
originally
in
1978
and
by
the
district
court
and
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
upheld
it
again
when
it
was
challenged
in
1980.
now,
in
assessing
the
validity
of
this
statute
under
the
establishment
clause,
it
is
very
important
that
the
court
keep
foremost
in
mind
that
the
central
prohibition
of
the
establishment
clause
is
the
singling
out
of
religious
organizations
or
religious
groups
for
direct
assistance.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
statute
provides
direct
assistance
is
crucial
because
it
is
that
type
of
assistance
which
denotes
sponsorship,
advancement,
a
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
religious
institutions
of
the
state
which
is
one
of
sponsor
and
sponsored.
it
is
also
a
symbolic
matter
that
this
court
recognized
in
grendel's
den
whether
or
not
then
state
has
entered
into
a
sponsorship
relationship
with
religion.
it
is
also
important
whether
or
not
a
statute
singles
out
any
particular
group
or
any
particular
type
of
institution
for
benefits,
because
the
establishment
clause
requires
neutrality,
it
requires
that
legislatures
adopt
laws
which
neither
advance
nor
inhibit
religious
institutions,
and
to
the
extent
that
broad
classes
of
beneficiaries
have
been
identified
under
a
statute
it
indicates
that
any
religious
benefit
is
incidental
to
that
broad
classification.
the
plaintiff
suggests
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
nyquist,
but
the
differences
between
this
case
and
nyquist
are
the
differences
which
lie
at
the
heart
of
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
we
are
not,
your
honor.
we
submit
that
nyquist
was
properly
decided
and
can
stand
equally
beside
this
case.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
okay.
nyquist
involved
two
types
of
programs.
the
first
was
a
direct
transfer
of
monies
from
the
state
treasury
to
low-income
people,
approximately
$50,
essentially
in
exchange
for
enrolling
their
children
in
non-public
schools.
coupled
with
that
was
a
very
careful--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--your
honor,
if
it
can
be
said
that
it
is
true,
it
is
going
to
have
to
be
extremely
indirectly,
because
what
the
legislation--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--okay.
what
the
legislature
has
said
is
that
for
those
actual
expenditures
incurred
by
a
particular
taxpayer
in
educating
his
or
her
child
either
in
a
public
or
private
school,
if
they
actually
incurred
those
expenditures,
then
it
is
going
to
be
treated
as
a
reduction
in
one's
net
income
in
arriving
at
one's
taxable
income.
essentially
what
the
legislature
has
said
is
that
we
are
going
to
acknowledge
the
fact
that
educational
expenses,
regardless
of
where
those
monies
are
paid,
constitute
a
reduction
in
available
income,
in
disposable
income,
in
much
the
same
way
that
payments
to
physicians
or--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--your
honor,
as
with
any
deduction,
there
is
going
to
be
a
disparate
effect
with
regard
to
the
amount
of
money
one
actually
pays
and
their
particular
income.
that
is
inherent
in
a
deduction
under
a
progressive
income
tax
system.
just
as
if
someone
chooses
to
pay
far
more
money
than
his
neighbor
to
physicians
or
for
mortgage
payments
and
that
person
has
a
higher
income,
they
are
going
to
receive
a
larger
deduction
and
they
are
going
to
be
in
a
substantially
different
position
than
those
who
pay
less.
but,
that
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
deductions
under
progressive
income
tax
system
are
wise
or
not.
but,
it
doesn't
implicate
establishment
clause
values,
because
it
is
not
a
distinction
made
upon
religious
lives
or
the
singling
out
of
religious
institutions
or
those
attending
those
institutions,
but
rather
is
a
long,
traditional
line
of
income
and
expenditure
which
are
the
classic
definitions,
classic
classifications
used
in
an
income
tax
system.
continuing
on--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--as
a
matter
of
fact
that
is
true.
there
is
an
allen
type
provision
of
textbooks
to
both
public
and
private
students.
the--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--okay.
first,
one
must
assume
that
textbooks,
secular
textbooks,
which
would
fall
under
deduction,
are
generally
being
provided
throughout.
they
are
generally
being
provided.
so
that
it
is
unlikely
that
they
are
going
to
be
major
amounts
of
deductions
taken
which
are
attributable
to
textbooks.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
we
ought
not
be
arguing
statistics
beyond
a
particular
point.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
crucial
statistics
are
those
which
identify
whether
or
not
the
nominal
class
provided
by
the
statute
actually
does
result
in
real
and
substantial
benefits
across
that
class.
and,
once
it
has
been
established
that,
by
statistical
analysis
if
that
need
be,
that
benefits
to
those
in
public
schools
are
not
illusory,
it
seems
to
me
then
that
the
classification
system
has
been
proven
to
be
neutral
and
does
not
result
in
direct
assistance
to
any
specialized
class.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
about
nyquist,
yes.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
oh,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
your
honor,
there
is
included
within
the
ambit
of
deduction
of
materials
beyond
textbooks.
those
will
include
things
such
as
art
supplies,
home
economics,
shop
supplies.
they
will
include
gym
uniforms,
tennis
shoes.
they
will
include
very
mundane
items
such
as
pencils,
paper,
notebooks,
all
of
which
are
deductible.
the
provision
of
a
deduction
in
that
particular
case,
however,
doesn't
provide
any
state
sponsorship
of
those
expenditures.
there
is
no
money
being
transferred
out
of
the
legislature
here
so
that
those
things
will
be
provided.
thus,
it
is
entirely
unlike
those
provisions
where
a
particular
equipment
is
being
supplied
by
the
state.
these
are
all
being
supplied
by
individual
expenditures
and
there
is
no
transfer
of
money
by
the
state.
it
is
also
important
to
know
that
under
section
170,
a
wealthy
benefactor
might
buy
these
same
materials,
receive
a
deduction
for
them
and
make
them
available
to
those
attending
sectarian
schools.
there
the
court,
it
appears
to
me,
is
not
likely
to
say
that
that
would
constitute
state
or
federal
sponsorship.
the
religious
institutions
that
may
benefit
simply
because
a
wealthy
person
has
provided
a
fund
for
those
students
to
use
in
buying
books,
in
buying
materials,
or
even
in
paying
tuition.
there
are
also
benefits
available
to
public
school
students
under
that
textbook
expenditure.
as
we
have
indicated,
materials
such
as
personal
items,
personal
physical
education
items,
and
it
is
this
type
of
expenditure
that
is
not
taken
into
consideration
by
the
statistics
that
the
plaintiffs
have
presented.
they
assume
in
all
their
briefs
below
and
in
the
brief
before
this
court
that
any
benefit
to
those
attending
public
schools
must
be
de
minimus.
but,
there
are
about
800,000
public
school
students
and
if
a
small
percentage
of
those
people
took
deductions
for
relatively
minor
amounts,
the
statistical
analysis
would
be
completely
different,
vastly
different,
than
what
has
been
presented
by
the
plaintiffs
so
far.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
your
honor,
the
major
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
assure...
there
are
several
purposes
of
the
statute,
but
one
of
them
is
to
assure
that
there
is
an
availability
of
choice
that
individuals
can
make
as
to
whether
to
attend
or
not.
it
is
also
a
legislative
recognition
that
the
income
devoted
to
educating
one's
child
does
constitute
a
drain
which
can
equitably
and
reasonably
be
recognized
by
the
legislature
in
identifying
taxable
income
much
the
same
way
when
you
expend
money
on
medical
assistance
or
things
of
that
sort.
the
legislature
is
going
to
recognize
that
in
calculating
taxable
income.
so
that
there
are
benefits
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
pursued
to
the
extent
that
there
are
benefits
available
for
public
school
students
as
well.
it
also
seems
to
me
too
that
even
if
the
purpose
were
limited
solely
to
maintaining
the
continued
viability,
if
you
will,
of
private
schools
so
long
as
there
is
not
a
primary
effect
which
advances
religion,
that
purpose
certainly
is
not
going
to
be
considered
and
invalid
sectarian
purpose.
many
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
reviewed
and
many
of
the
types
of
programs
that
it
has
already
upheld
relate
solely
to
those
people
attending
private
schools,
non-public
schools.
a
very
good
example
most
recently
are
those
benefits
that
were
available
to
the
non-public
schools
in
the
regan
case
where
reimbursements
for
taking
attendance,
for
administering
tests,
for
grading
tests
were
all
valid
and
that
is
even
where
you
have
a
purpose
that
is
clearly
aimed
only
at
non-public
schools.
i
don't
think
that
is
the
case
with
regard
to
this
particular
statute.
the
plaintiffs
do
suggest
that
in
a
1976
revenue
memorandum
prepared
by
a
staff
member
of
the
department
of
revenue,
and
it
is
dated
several
days
after
the
effective
date
of
the
legislature,
but
i
understand
there
was
one
before
the
effective
date
of
the
law,
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
there
was
another
one
floating
around
before
that
time,
suggests
that
the
benefits
are
only
available
to
those
attending
non-public
schools.
that
memorandum
represents
an
attempt
by
the
revenue
department
to
say
these
are
the
figures
we
can
get,
we
are
going
to
assume
it
is
only
for
tuition.
if
there
is
anything
that
showed
what
actually
is
going
on
and
what
their
effect
of
the
statute
is
it
is
going
to
be
the
more
recent
data
submitted
by
the
revenue
department
which,
as
the
justice
department's
amicus
brief
indicates,
over
204,000
dependents
were
represented
by
that
deduction
and
at
that
time
there
were
only
about
90,000
sectarian
students.
so
that
the
majority
of
those
people
taking
the
deduction
are
actually
not
attending
sectarian
schools.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
clear
indication
of
the
broad
effect,
the
broad
availability
of
the
deduction.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
yes.
it
does
not,
although
that
is
definitely
a
shortcoming
in
the
statistics,
but
it
is
not
a
material
one,
because--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--your
honor,
it
is
possible
that
those
attending
public
schools
may.
for
instance,
those--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--that
is
right.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
it
is
very
unlikely
that
100,000
of
them
have
a
full
$500
deduction.
but,
it
is
also
unlikely
that
all
of
those
people
attending
sectarian
schools
or
non-public
schools
will
have
maximum
deductions
as
well.
in
order
to
achieve
that
calculation,
you
have
to
assume
that
all
private
schools
charge
tuition
and
i
think
it
is
fairly
clear
that
there
are
some
who
provide
or
charge
on
a
basis
of
whether
one
can
afford
it,
to
what
degree
one
can
afford
it.
the
decisions
of
this
case
clearly
indicate
that
extensions
from
taxation
do
not
constitute
the
active
sort
of
assistance
which
traditionally
has
been
thought
to
constitute
state
sponsorship
of
religion.
this
was
true
in
the
walz
case
where
property
tax
exemption
was
found
not
to
constitute
any
active
sponsorship
of
the
religious
institution.
and,
it
is
based
upon
several
factors
which
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
establishment
clause
and
go
to
the
very
nature
of
tax
deductions.
when
a
state
government
determines
to
abstain
from
taxing
income
devoted
to
particular
activities,
it
has
not
transferred
any
state
money
from
the
treasury
to
any
particular
individual
or
to
any
particular
group.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
that
is
true.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
yes,
that
is
absolutely
true
in
walz.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
they
are
contributing
to
the
support
of
the
church.
what
they
are
contributing
to
is
the
support
of
the
state
and
whether
or
not
the
state
can
identify--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--walz
recognized
the
fact
that
to
the
extent
that
some
institutions
are
relieved
of
the
tax
burden
others
will
be
called
upon
to
pay
more.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
but,
what
is
involved
at
the
heart
of
the
establishment
clause
is
whether
or
not
the
legislature
or
state
government
has
decided
to
enter
into
a
sponsorship
relationship
with
the
church,
advancing
its
cause
by
either
directing
money
to
an
obviously
sectarian
purpose
or
singling
it
out
for
some
particular
special
kind
of
benefit.
in
walz
it
was
particularly
important
that
religious
institutions
fell
inside
a
broader
class
of
non-profit
institutions
and
this
case
essentially
presents
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
walz
were
limited
only
to
educational
institutions.
it
would
somehow
therefore
be
rendered
unconstitutional.
the
fact
is
that
those
institutions
which
fall
inside
the
category,
the
expenditures
at
those
institutions
which
fall
inside
the
classification
system
used
in
the
minnesota
deduction
constitute
all
of
those
expenses
that
are
likely
to
be
incurred
or
generally
are
incurred
by
those
attending
public
or
private
schools.
it
is
impossible
to
identify,
i
believe,
even
if
we
put
our
minds
to
it
very
strenuously,
some
type
of
expenditure
which
public
school
students
incur
which
does
not
receive
a
deductible
status,
but,
which
if
incurred
by
private
school
students
would.
those
expenditures
which
are
actually
incurred
by
those
in
public
schools
do
result
in
tax
deductions.
the
benefits
that
any
individual
receives
under
this
particular
type
of
deduction
are
as
justice
white
pointed
out
in
his
question
at
least
more
indirect
than
those
an
institution
would
have
received
under
a
walz
style
tax
exemption.
what
is
going
on,
for
instance,
in
section
170
is
a
direct
payment
to
an
institution
which
qualifies
for
tax
deduction.
now,
the
plaintiffs
suggests
that
the
fundamental,
crucial
distinction
is
between
deductions
which
are
received
for
payments
which
flow
from
disinterested
generosity
and
those
which
flow
from
payment
as
user
fees.
but,
it
is
impossible
to
identify
a
constitutionally
significant
difference
in
those.
if,
for
instance,
the
purpose
of
the
establishment
clause
is
to
make
sure
that
the
state
does
not
enter
into
a
relationship
of
sponsorship
with
a
church,
then
the
user
fee
analysis
that
the
plaintiffs
put
forth
distinguishes
between
the
section
170
type
of
direct
payment
to
religious
institutions
for
obviously
religious
purposes,
the
building
of
buildings
and
payment
of
fees
to
clergy,
things
of
that
sort,
and
makes
that
valid.
it
makes
it
invalid
for
persons
to
pay
tuition
to
an
institution
that
provides
education
to
his
or
her
child
or
if,
for
instance,
we
were
to
say
that
the
establishment
clause's
purpose
was
to
make
sure
that
no
one
is
taxed
in
order
to
support
a
religion
other
than
of
their
own
choosing,
we
find
that
the
user
fee
analysis
makes
another
decision
that
bears
no
relationship
to
the
establishment
clause.
what
it
does
is
to
say
that
equally
indirect
benefits
to
individuals
and
to
institutions
are
somehow
different
under
that
purpose
and
permits
one
and
invalidates
the
other.
the
plaintiffs
use
of
statistics
is
also
difficult
in
this
particular
case,
difficult
to
identify
the
reasons
for
which
it
is
material
to
establishment
clause
analysis.
their
statistics
indicate
that
about
10
%
of
those
attending
schools
attend
sectarian
schools
in
minnesota
and
mr.
justice
powell
requested
some
information
about
the
percentage
of
those
people
attending
schools
earlier.
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
early
statistics
for
which
they
know
the
percentage
of
sectarian
students.
it
is
about
1959
to
1960
according
to
education
data
which
is
issued
every
march.
in
about
1959
or
1960,
about
18.7
%
of
the
school
student
population
attended
sectarian
institutions.
now,
that
has
plummeted
and
it
is
now...
was...
about
10
%.
i
think
it
has
grown
to
10.1
or
10.2
within
the
last
year.
and,
i
apologize
for
making
reference
to
non-record
data,
but
it
appears
to
be
information
that
you
requested.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
the
record--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--your
honor,
the
record
consists
primarily
of
information
which
was
supplied
by
the
department
of
education
and
the
department
of
revenue
in
response
to
certain
requests
and
by
the
hard
work
of--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--your
honor,
we
have
facts
concerning
that
portion
of
the
population
in
the
test
year
which
is
1978.
it
indicates
that
10
%
of
the
people
attending
school
attended
sectarian
schools.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
in
the
record--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--okay.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
your
honor,
the
record--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--the
record
that
is
contained
in
there,
and
it
is
the
record
that
was
submitted
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
suggests
the
percentage
of
those
attending
non-sectarian
schools,
percentage
of...
amount
of
revenue
loss,
things
of
that
type.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
the
reports
of
the
state
board
of
education
would
show
you
the
general
population
trends
of
those
attending
non-public
schools
as
opposed
to
those
attending
public
schools.
the
revenue
data,
which
is
the
most
recently
available,
is
attached
at
the
end
of
our
memorandum.
it
is
from
a
study
that
was
conducted
which
amicus
in
support
of
the
petitioners
made
reference
to
and
which
resulted
in
certain
calculations
which
appear
at
the
back
of
our
memorandum.
but,
ultimately...
ultimately,
details
concerning
what
particular
group
of
people
benefited
more
or
were
the
predominate
beneficiaries
under
the
particular
statute
is,
in
our
estimation
and
in
the
estimation
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
irrelevant.
it
is
not
material
to
the
case.
for
instance,
if
we
were
to
look
at
which
organizations
or
group
of
organizations
was
the
predominate
beneficiary
under
section
170,
historically
we
would
find
that
religious
institutions
took
the
bulk
of
deductions
or
the
contributions
to
religious
institutions
received
the
bulk
of
deductions.
similarly,
i
would
suspect,
although
i
am
not
certain,
that
religious
institutions
are
also
the
predominant
beneficiaries
under
walz
style
property
tax
exemptions.
but,
those
facts
are
not
going
to
be
sufficient
to
hold
that
that
property
tax
exemption
in
walz
or
section
170
of
the
internal
revenue
code
are
unconstitutional.
the
reason
is
that
the...
the
establishment
clause
requires
that
religious
institutions
and
those
associated
with
religious
groups
be
treated
neutrally;
that
they
not
be
hindered,
that
they
not
be
advanced,
but
the
establishment
clause
does
not
require
that
religious
institutions
always
come
out
second
best
or
religious
always
come
out
second
best
under
any
neutral
set
of
criteria.
the
plaintiffs
have
also
suggested
that
it
is
important
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
restriction
on
the
tuition
fees
which
may
be
paid
or
the
textbooks...
excuse
me,
the
transportation
uses
which
will
qualify
for
deductions.
they
suggest
that
because
you
cannot
identify
the
secular
from
the
sectarian
or
because
the
statute
doesn't
attempt
to
identify
the
secular
from
the
sectarian
that
it
is
unconstitutional;
that
we
either
have
a
primary
effect
problem
or
we
are
going
to
have
an
entanglement
problem.
the
fact
is,
however,
that
those
types
of...
that
type
of
separation
is
very
important
when
you
have
direct
state
assistance,
money
or
goods
flowing
out
of
the
treasury
to
individuals
or
to
religious
institutions.
when
you
supply
textbooks,
when
you
supply
equipment,
it
is
important
because
of
the
symbolic
sponsorship
problem
that
may
arise,
that
institutions
not
receive
assistance
to
clearly
sectarian
activities.
but,
we
recognize
in
walz
and
under
section
170
that
tax
deductions
are
going
to
be
available
for
people
who
make
direct
payments
to
the
institution.
as
i
have
indicated
before,
section
170
would
permit
an
individual
to
supply
textbooks,
supply
bibles,
supply
buses
to
private
schools
and
take
a
deduction
for
them.
yet,
if
individuals
purchase
that
sort
of
equipment,
that
sort
of
transportation
from
an
institution
and
spend
their
own
money
in
much
the
same
way
a
contributor
might,
that
is
going
to
be
unconstitutional.
the
difference
between
them
seems
to
be
impossible
to
reconcile
with
the
purposes
of
the
establishment
clause,
to
avoid
the
sponsorship
or
the
symbolic
appearance
of
sponsorship.
it
is
also
difficult
to
identify
the
source
of
the
petitioners'
indication
that
$17
million
in
revenue
loss
is
attributable
to
this
deduction
for
the
biennial.
i
am
not
certain
where
the
figure
came
from.
i
do
know
that
the
revenue
department
estimated
for
1980
it
was
about
$4.1
million.
and,
although
i
don't
believe
it
is
particularly
relevant
to
the
resolution
of
this
case,
mr.
justice
powell
asked
concerning
the
budget
for
public
schools
and
i
can
only
entertain
the
same
type
of
estimation
that
was
presented
here.
the
foundation
aids
formula
is
based
upon
approximately
$1400
per
student
and
currently
there
are
between
750,000...
about
750,000
or
800,000
public
students.
so,
the
legislature
anticipates
expenditures
of
approximately
1.2
billion
or
in
excess
of
a
billion
dollars
for
public
education.
i
am
not
certain
of
the
actual
appropriated
funds,
because
the
appropriation
says
as
much
money
as
necessary
will
be
transferred
from
the
treasury
to
pay
foundation
aid.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
your
honor,
there
again,
i
am
afraid
that
i
can't
tell
you
precisely
how
that
breaks
down.
all
i
can
tell
you
is
the
foundation
aids
formula
assumes
expenditures--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--there
are
property
taxes
paid--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--to
districts,
school
districts,
and
state
aids.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
that
is
correct.
it
is
not
based
on--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--that
is
correct.
the
primary
argument
of
the
plaintiffs
and
the
petitioners
here
is
that
nyquist
must
control
the
case.
i
think
it
is
important
to
draw
the
distinction
between
nyquist
and
this
case
because
the
nyquist
distinctions
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
establishment
clause
jurisprudence.
the
nyquist
case
involved
benefits
where
the
legislature
had
identified
specific
amounts
of
money
it
wanted
to
make
available
to
individuals
who
had
enrolled
their
children
in
private,
predominately
sectarian
schools.
it
represents
a
legislative
determination
that
for
performing
a
specific
act
a
specific
amount
of
money
is
going
to
be
provided
to
individuals.
in
order
to
achieve
that
result,
a
particularly...
what
shall
we
say...
detailed
form
of
tax
table
was
provided
so
that
if
you
had
an
income
of
less
than
"x"
amount,
you
were
to
take...
exempt
from
your
income
a
particular
amount
regardless
of
whether
that
was
more
or
less
or
any
relationship
to
what
you
pay
to
a
particular
institution.
now,
it
is
that
kind
of
relationship,
the
fundamental
decision
of
a
legislature
to
benefit
particular
individuals
for
particular
acts,
which
is
important
to
establishment
clause
analysis.
it
is
also
important
that
the
only
group
who
could
benefit
under
the
nyquist
provision
were
those
in
private
schools.
there
were
no
benefits.
if
there
were
expenditures
associated
with
attending
public
school
beyond
those
which
are
covered
by
state
payments
or
public
school
payments,
there
is
no
way
that
those
are
going
to
result
in
any
benefits
under
the
provision
there.
and,
it
is
this
singling
out
of
a
particular
group
for
benefits
which
are
not
available
across
the
board,
which
shows
that
benefits
to
religious
institutions
were
not
incidental,
which
shows
that
there
may
be
problems
of
political
divisiveness,
because
groups
being
formed
along
private
lines
which
become
predominately
sectarian
lines.
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
there
are
about
four
types
of
tuition
that
are
actually
paid
by
those
people
in
public
schools.
there
are
those
who
pay
non-resident
tuition.
and,
in
1978
there
were
only
about
79
people
who
did
that.
but,
there
are
other
types
of--
mr.
douglas
c.
blomgren
--it
is
certainly
the
policy
to
make
it
available
to
them
if
they
want.
for
instance,
it
may
very
well
be
that
although
one
is
in
one
district,
the
school
is
closer
to
someone
else.
in
rural
areas
particularly,
it
is
very
important
to
some
that
they
be
attending
schools
that
are
closer
to
their
own
residence
and
not
farther
from
their
own
residence.
and,
there
are
other
kinds
of
tuition
payments
available
too.
if
there
were
only
79
people
who
paid
the
tuition,
you
would
have
benefits...
you
would
not
show
payments
of
lower
than
$2
million
in
tuition
payments
in
1978
alone.
my
time
is
through.
thank
you
very
much.
