after
the
'46
amendment,
what?
are
they
allowed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
allowed
as
a
matter
of
course?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
notwithstanding
it
says
"interest
and
costs
as
fixed
by
the
court.
"
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
allowed
as
a
matter
of
course.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
wonder
why
interest
is
in
the
same
category.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
law
as
to
interest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
frost--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--aro
sort
of
accepted
what
the
house
report
said,
did
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
inadvertent,
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
is
in
line,
i
made
a
mistake.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
actual
language
was,
"together
with
interest
from
the
time
infringement
occurred
rather
than
profits
and
damages.
"
then
aro
went
on
to
say,
"there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
amendment
succeeded
in
effectuating
this
purpose.
"
this
is
way
back
in
1963,
and
i
confess
my
memory
of
what
we
were
thinking
about
then
doesn't
help
me.
