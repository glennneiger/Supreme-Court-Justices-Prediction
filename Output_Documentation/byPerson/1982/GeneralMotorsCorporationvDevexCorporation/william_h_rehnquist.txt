william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
question
whether
it
requires
it
or
whether
it
permits
it,
or
are
they
the
same
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
you
could
argue
just
as
well
that
congress
was
dealing
with
attorneys'
fees
in
1952,
and
decided
to
require
them
only
in
exceptional
circumstances.
it
depends
on
which
word
and
phrase
you
catalogue
the
thing
under.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
1952,
was
a
general
revision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
codification.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how,
again,
were
your
damages
computed?
was
that.75
percent
of
something?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
some
of
those
bumpers
were
presumably
sold
in
1963
and
at
$100,
and
if
you
had
gotten
your
judgment
in
1963,
you
would
have
gotten
100
1963
dollars.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
it
is,
you
are
getting
100
1982
dollars.
