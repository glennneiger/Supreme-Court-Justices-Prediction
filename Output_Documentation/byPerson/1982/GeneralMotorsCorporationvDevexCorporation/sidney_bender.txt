mr.
sidney
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
plaintiff's
position
is
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed
on
two
separate
grounds,
as
was
found
by
the
courts
below.
the
first
ground
is
that
section
284
requires
the
payment
of
interest
from
the
date
infringement
occurred,
and
secondly,
the
award
of
interest
is
permissible
and
within
the
sound
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
and
that
here
that
discretion
was
properly
exercised,
and
the
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals
demonstrates
that.
mr.
sidney
bender
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
under
those
circumstances
the
case
ends
there.
mr.
sidney
bender
yes.
i
believe
that
under
those
circumstances
it
is
mandatory
that
interest
should
run
from
the
time
infringement
occurred,
and
it
is
my
position
here,
your
honor,
that
the
statute
should
be
read
that
way
in
light
of
the
evidence
of
the
legislative
history,
and
in
light
of
the
aro
decision.
mr.
sidney
bender
the
court
below
did
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
bender
position.
mr.
sidney
bender
they
adopted
both
positions,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
bender
they
adopted...
they
adopted
the...
the
court
of
appeals,
at
page
336
of
the
record,
if
your
honor
please,
specifically
quoted
from
the
aro
decision.
mr.
sidney
bender
and
in
addition,
they
held
that
they
were
affirming
also
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
trial
court,
and
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
if
i
may,
and
the
starting
point
in
every
case,
as
this
court
has
held
in
ernst
and
ernst
v.
hockfelder,
is
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
and
indeed,
the
ascertainment
of
congressional
intent
must
rest
primarily
on
the
language
of
the
statute.
now,
this
statute
says,
"the
court
shall
award
adequate
compensation,
but
not
less
than
a
reasonable
royalty
together
with
interest
and
costs
as
fixed
by
the
court.
"
we
submit
that
the
term
"shall
award
a
reasonable
royalty
together
with
interest.
"
is
mandatory,
at
least
that
prejudgment
interest
should
be
awarded.
the
part
"as
may
be
fixed
by
the
court.
"
we
submit
goes
to
the
interest
rate
as
being
discretionary
with
the
court,
and
that
discretion
was
exercised
by
the
trial
court
here,
and
there
has
been
no
appeal
and
no
contest
on
the
interest
rate
that
was
awarded
below.
mr.
sidney
bender
that
was
fixed
by
the
special
master
pursuant
to
the
parties
stipulating
as
to
what
the
interest
rates
would
be--
mr.
sidney
bender
--pardon
me?
mr.
sidney
bender
in
every
year,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
sidney
bender
--the
order
was...
it
was
a
stipulation
that
was
signed
by
the
parties
in
november
of
1978,
and
the
special
master
awarded
the
interest
in
february
of
1980
on
his
recommendation,
and
the
district
court
entered
judgment
in
october
of
1980.
mr.
sidney
bender
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
no
question
but
that
what
they
are
talking
about
there
is
prejudgment
interest,
and
there
is
another
statute
on
post-judgment
interest,
and
that
post-judgment
interest
is
affixed
according
to
state
law,
and
no
one
has
challenged
that
particular
concept,
your
honor.
that
is
really
not
in
issue.
so
that
plaintiff's
submission
is
that
"together
with
interest"
at
least
means
that
the
prejudgment
interest
as
such
is
mandatory.
now,
considering
the
fact
that
the
statute
as
passed
is
silent
as
to
the
time
frame
and
as
to
when
the
interest
should
begin
to
run,
then
under
those
circumstances
the
intended
scope
of
the
interest
provision
is
revealed
explicitly
in
the
legislative
history.
the
senate
committee
expressly
adopted
the
house
committee
report,
which
stated,
"a
reasonable
royalty
together
with
interest
from
the
time
infringement
occurred.
"
in
addition,
the
house
committee's
rationale
was
also
stated,
namely,
in
referring
to
proceedings
before
masters
that
are
often
protracted
for
decades,
and
in
many
cases
result
in
a
complete
failure
of
justice.
thus,
the
statute
history
reflects
the
intent
of
congress
to
make
interest
mandatory
from
the
time
infringement
occurred.
this
interpretation
is
not
a
departure
from
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
is
consistent
with
it.
the
house
committee
report
with
respect
to
the
1946
amendment
stated,
"the
object
of
the
bill
is
to
make
the
basis
of
recovery
in
patent
infringement
suits
general
damages,
that
is,
any
damages
that
complainant
can
prove
not
less
than
a
reasonable
royalty
together
with
interest
from
the
time
infringement
occurred.
"
so,
as
the
bill
left
the
house,
three
things
were
mandatory
in
that
bill:
interest,
costs,
and
attorneys'
fees.
when
the
bill...
and
at
that
particular
time,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
read
the
proposed
house
bill.
it
provided
"royalty
therefore
together
with
his
costs
and
reasonable
attorneys'
fees
to
be
fixed
by
the
court
and
interest
from
the
time
infringement
occurred.
"
and
that
was
the
shape
of
the
bill
as
it
left
the
house.
the
senate
itself
adopted
the
mandatory
provisions
of
the
house
bill
on
interest
and
costs,
but
amended
it
to
make
attorneys'
fees
discretionary.
as
the
bill
was
amended
by
the
senate,
the
bill
read
"royalty
therefore
together
with
such
costs
and
interest
as
may
be
fixed
by
the
court.
"
"the
court
may
in
its
discertion
award
reasonable
attorneys'
fees
to
the
prevailing
party
upon
the
entry
of
judgment
on
any
patent
case.
"
end
of
quote.
therefore,
it
was
clear
that
when
the
senate
wanted
to
say
"in
its
discretion"
with
respect
to
attorneys'
fees,
it
so
stated.
it
didn't
say
anything
to
change
the
basic
mandatory
concept
about
interest
and
costs.
and
it
did
delete--
mr.
sidney
bender
"together
with
interest
and
costs
as
may
be
fixed
by
the
court.
"
mr.
sidney
bender
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
bender
the
ordinary
reading
of
that,
your
honor,
would
be
that
interest
and
costs
were
mandatory
except
that
costs
are
discretionary
as
to
amount,
and
interest
is
discretionary
as
to
rate.
mr.
sidney
bender
it
does
apply
to
interest.
mr.
sidney
bender
because
if
your
honor
please,
i
believe
if
the...
if
the
congress
intended
to
make
interest
and
costs
discretionary,
just
as
it
did
with
attorneys'
fees,
they
would
have
worded
it
this
way.
"the
court
may
in
its
discretion
award
interest,
costs,
and
attorneys'
fees
to
the
prevailing
party.
"
mr.
sidney
bender
but,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
does
take
it
out
of
context,
because
the
preamble
to
that
is,
"the
court
shall
award
a
reasonable
royalty.
"
"the
court
shall
award
a
reasonable
royalty
together
with
interest.
"
and
under
those
circumstances,
i
believe
that
the
"together
with
interest"
and
"a
reasonable
royalty"
mean
that
the
court
must
fix
a
reasonable
royalty
together
with
interest,
and
"as
fixed
by
the
court"
does
not
mean
that
the
interest
itself
is
fully
discretionary.
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
that,
if
your
honor
please,
because
senator
pepper
in
reporting
the
house
bill
to
the
senate,
he
said,
it
is
a
house
bill,
and
he
says,
it
has
the
unanimous
support
of
the
senate
committee
on
patents.
in
fact,
the
bill
as
adopted
by
the
senate,
contrary
to
what
mr.
frost
said,
was
very
specific
about
that.
it
says,
"the
house
committee
on
patents
held
hearings
and
made
the
following
report,
which
is
adopted
as
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
on
patents.
"
and
then
it
set
forth
what
the
house
committee
report
was,
and
that
said,
"together
with
interest
from
the
time
infringement
occurred.
"
and
i
submit
that
the
senate
did
not
intend
to
change
the
part
it
is
true
that
"from
the
time
infringement
occurred"
was
deleted,
but
the
legislative
intent,
when
seen
in
context
and
the
fact
that
senator
pepper
only
referred
to
the
change
on
attorneys'
fees
being
made
discretionary,
demonstrates
that
the
senate
did
not
intend
to
change
the
purport
of
the
interest
provision.
mr.
sidney
bender
and
that
is
what
senator
pepper
thought.
mr.
sidney
bender
yes,
your
honor,
and
when
the
bill--
mr.
sidney
bender
--well,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
he
was
managing
the
bill.
and
when
the
bill
came
back
to
the
house
after
it
had
been
amended
by
the
senate,
representative
lanham,
who
had
managed
the
bill,
reported
that
the...
reported
that
the
senate
amendment
does
not
interfere
with
the
purport
of
the
bill.
"there
is
a
provision
with
reference
to
attorneys'
fees
and
how
they
shall
be
paid.
"
end
of
quote.
and
that
was
the
report
as
the
bill
had
come
back
to
the
house
of
representatives
and
as
amended
by
the
senate,
the
bill
was
again
passed
by
the
house.
in
1964,
this
court,
in
deciding
the
aro
case,
adopted
the
mandatory
interest
language
that
was
contained
in
the
house
committee
report.
referring
to
the
1946
amendment,
this
court
quoted
from
the
house
report
adopted
by
the
senate,
and
this
court
made
note
of
the
fact
that
the
senate
report...
it
referred
to
the
senate
report
as
well.
that
was
one
of
the
references
to
the
quotation,
was
to
the
senate
report
in
the
aro
case,
and
there,
this
court
said,
"the
object
of
the
bill
is
to
make
the
basis
of
recovery.
"
skipping,
"not
less
than
reasonable
royalty
together
with
interest
from
the
time
infringement
occurred.
"
and
the
devex
case
was
not
the
only
case
that
referred
to
the
aro
report.
in
1964,
the
marvel
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
adopted
and
followed
the
language
specifically
of
the
aro
court...
of
the
aro
decision
by
this
court,
and
then
devex
followed
that
decision
as
well,
and
there
have
been
many
district
court
decisions
that
have
likewise
followed
the
aro
decision
on
the
question
of
prejudgment
interest.
in
fact,
gm
in
its
reply
brief
at
page
2
concedes
that
the
house
committee
language,
"interest
from
the
time
infringement
occurred.
"
is
"mandatory
interest
language".
and
that
is
page
2
of
general
motors'
reply.
the
effect
of
the
'46
amendment
is
correctly
stated
in
35
ucs,
appendix
2,
section
70,
in
which,
in
reference
to
the
'46
amendment,
it
says,
"a
reasonable
royalty
together
with
interest
from
the
time
infringement
occurred.
"
now,
this
appeared
before
the
1952
codification
in
the
present
section
284.
so
congress
knew
how
this
1946
amendment
was
being
reported
in
the
text.
mr.
sidney
bender
it
was
being
reported
as
interest
from
the
time
infringement
occurred.
mr.
sidney
bender
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
am
very
sorry.
that
under
the
circumstances,
congress
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
was
being
reported
that
interest
from
the
time
infringement
occurred
was
the
construction,
at
least
in
terms
of
the
legislative
note
with
respect
to
35
usc
section
70.
despite
that,
congress
re-enacted
section
284,
and
in
its
present
form,
which
is
"together
with
interest
as
fixed
by
the
court.
"
this
court,
in
applying
another
patent
statute,
28
usc
section
1498,
under
which
the
united
states
pays
compensation
for
patent
use,
adopted
the
view
that
interest
runs
from
the
date
of
infringement,
despite
the
fact
that
there
is
no
reference
in
the
statute
to
interest.
they
adopted
that
view
because
the
statute
reads
"entire
compensation",
and
this
court
has
said
that
in
order
to
make
entire
compensation
under
the
circumstances,
it
is
necessary
to
give
interest
from
the
time
infringement
occurred,
and
in
order
to
do
complete
justice,
as
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
united
states
government.
now,
we
submit
the
statute
here
provides
for
adequate
compensation,
and
it
also
expressly
refers
to
"together
with
interest".
and
under
those
circumstances,
interest
should
be
allowed
from
the
time
infringement
occurred.
arguendo,
even
if
interest
is
mandatory
and
the
time
frame
is
discretionary,
we
submit
that
under
those
circumstances,
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
in
allowing
interest
from
the
time
infringement
occurred
here
in
this
case,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
saying
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
district
court.
in
1952,
congress
specifically
provided
for
the
award
of
attorneys'
fees
only
in
exceptional
cases,
thus
demonstrating
its
intent
not
to
require
exceptional
circumstances
before
there
is
an
award
of
interest.
clearly,
congress
was
dealing
with
the
term
1952.
mr.
sidney
bender
well,
if
your
honor
please,
what
congress
had
done
with
respect
to
attorneys'
fees
was
change
it
from
discretionary,
as
it
existed
in
1946,
in
1952
to
require
exceptional
circumstances
of
an
exceptional
case,
in
order
to
enable
a
prevailing
party
to
get
attorneys'
fees.
now,
the
defendant's
argument
is
that
the
duplate
rule
which
was
pre-1946
was
still
in
place
in
1946.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
we
submit
that
if
congress
intended
exceptional
circumstances
to
apply
also
to
interest,
it
would
have
so
stated.
instead,
it
left
the
1946
act
intact,
which
provided
"together
with
interest".
pre-1946,
section
70
was
completely
silent
on
interest.
mr.
sidney
bender
a
codification.
mr.
sidney
bender
and
section
284,
which
was
codified
in
1952,
provided
"together
with
interest"
and
dropped
out
the
term
"may
be"
and
said
"as
fixed
by
the
court",
and
"costs
as
fixed
by
the
court.
"
arguendo,
a
second
view
of
section
284
is
that
expressed
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
georgia
pacific
case,
in
which
it
was
held
that
the
change
in
the
statute
in
1946
was
intended
to
grant
the
trial
court
its
traditional
discretionary
power
in
equity.
even
if
this
court
adopts
the
view
of
the
second
circuit
and
says
that
section
284
is
a
discretionary
award
of
interest
in
its
entirety,
we
submit
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
trial
court
which
was
affirmed
by
the
third
circuit.
indeed,
the
court
in
georgia
pacific
rejected
the
argument
and
the
notion
that
by
the
1946
amendment,
congress
intended
no
change
whatsoever
in
the
existing
law
respecting
interest,
which
is
the
defendant's
position
here,
thus
demonstrating
that
that
issue
was
considered
by
the
second
circuit
and
rejected.
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
some
other
equitable
grounds
which
support
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
courts
below.
number
one,
gm's
entire
defense
below
was
founded
on
the
concept
that
the
selection
of
the
inorganic
chemicals
was
to
save...
costs
by
general
motors,
and
therefore
the
entire
reasonable
royalty
here
should
be
in
the
area
of
between
$100,000
and
$200,000.
the
special
master
said,
"that
this"...
the
special
master
held,
"that
this
was
contrived".
and
that
finding
of
fact
by
the
special
master
was
affirmed
by
the
district
court,
was
adopted
by
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court's
finding
that
in
addition
to
the
bumper
infringement
here,
that
there
was
infringement
on
non-bumper
parts
of
1,300,000,000
parts
that
had
been
made
by
the
hendricks
process,
and
that
there
was
good
infringement
proved
on
those
one
billion
parts.
despite
that,
and
despite
the
requirement
of
a
reasonable
royalty,
the
courts
held
below
that
plaintiffs
had
not
established
an
adequate
basis
for
determining
a
reasonable
royalty
on
non-bumper
parts,
despite
the
fact
that
plaintiff
showed
from
defendant's
own
records
that
there
were
savings
in
excess
of
$60
million
on
those
non-bumper
parts.
we
submit
that
this
is
an
additional
ground
for
holding
that
prejudgment
interest
is
proper
in
this
particular
situation.
in
addition,
let
us
show
by
the
mere
recital
of
the
facts
themselves
in
this
case.
gm
was
given
notice
in
1955
of
its
infringement.
the
lawsuit
was
commenced
in
november
of
1956.
almost
all
of
gm's
bumper
infringement
thereafter
took
place
after
the
commencement
of
this
litigation,
from
1956
through
to
march,
1969,
when
the
patent
expired.
and
then,
in
july
of
1963,
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
this
patent
was
valid,
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
january
of
'64.
in
november
of
1964,
16
years
before
a
decision
was
entered
in
the
district
court,
general
motors
was
offered
a
license
by
the
plaintiffs
at
three-quarters
of
1
percent
of
their
sales
prices.
gm
refused
that
offer
of
a
license.
after
16
years
of
litigation,
the
district
court
awarded
that
very
same
royalty
rate
of
three-quarters
of
1
percent
as
the
reasonable
royalty
here.
therefore,
16
years
of
litigation
could
have
been
avoided
had
general
motors
accepted
in
1964--
mr.
sidney
bender
--the
offer
that
was
ultimately
awarded
of
three-quarters
of
1
percent.
mr.
sidney
bender
no,
that
was
an
industry-wide
offer
at
that
time,
justice--
mr.
sidney
bender
--we
settled
with
other
people
in
litigations--
mr.
sidney
bender
--and...
at
lower
rates,
yes.
mr.
sidney
bender
no.
we
didn't
make
any
settlements
before
this
offer
was
made.
mr.
sidney
bender
there
was
an
industry
defense
against
this
patent,
your
honor.
the
chemical
companies,
the
suppliers
had
all
joined
together
with
general
motors
in
making
certain
that
they
were
going
to
defend
this
case
to
the
hilt,
and
nobody
took
a
license
from
the
plaintiffs,
and
that
in
effect,
that
open
infringement
by
the
entire
industry
even
beat
down
that
offer
that
we
made
of
three-quarters
of
1
percent.
it
is
this
simple
history
of
this
litigation
which
demonstrates
why
this
guilty
tort
feasor
did
not
take
a
license,
because
it
was
hoping
that
ultimately
it
was
going
to,
even
if
it
had
to
pay
a
reasonable
royalty
ultimately,
it
was
going
to
garner
in
the
interest
that
it
had
retained
from
that
reasonable
royalty
for,
indeed,
over
a
25-year
period,
gm
would
have
made
$11
million
of
interest
on
the
reasonable
royalty
if
it
were
permitted
to
keep
that
interest.
under
those
circumstances,
the
courts
below
found
that
it
would
be
against
public
policy
not
to
award
the
interest,
because
it
would
defeat
the
amicable
licensing
of
patents
and
it
would
tend
to
prolong
the
litigation.
indeed,
we
have
had
that
right
here,
that
this
litigation
has
been
prolonged
because
of
gm's
hope
that
it
will
not
have
to
pay
the
prejudgment
interest.
in
addition,
there
is
a
very...
another
very
important
factor
here
that
supports
the
judgment
below,
and
that
is
inflation.
when
this
lawsuit
was
begun,
in
1956,
the
inflation
factor
was
80.
in
1967,
that
inflation
factor
was
100.
in
july
of
this
year,
when
general
motors
paid
the
$8.8
million,
that
inflation
factor
was
291.8.
under
those
circumstances,
when
you
adjust
that
$8.8
million
by
the
inflation
factor,
the
plaintiffs
have
been
paid
in
real
dollars
$3
million.
mr.
sidney
bender
.75
of
1
percent
of
the
sales
value
of
the
bumpers,
which
was
$1,175,000,000.
mr.
sidney
bender
that's
correct.
mr.
sidney
bender
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
submit
that
is
a
further
ground
for
supporting
the
exercise
of
discretion
below.
we
must
not
overlook
the
fundamental
fact
that
this
is
a
26-year-old
patent
case.
the
patent
system
itself
must
provide
an
economic
incentive
to
invent,
innovate,
and
come
up
with
new
ideas.
indeed,
our
patent
system
cannot
survive
where
infringers
such
as
general
motors
adopt
a
policy
of
economic
interorems
which
is
designed
to
financially
exhaust
the
plaintiffs.
after
26
years
of
litigation,
it
would
be
a
grave
miscarriage
of
justice
to
take
away
prejudgment
interest
and
thus
leave
plaintiffs
without
adequate
compensation.
i
want
to
address
myself
to
the
fact
that
general
motors
has
stated
something
about
delay
by
the
plaintiffs.
the
district
court
made
a
specific
finding
in
connection
with
gm's
contention
to
have
the
costs
of
the
special
master
taxed
equally
between
the
plaintiffs
and
general
motors.
the
district
court
denied
that.
and
it
did
say
with
respect
to
cost
that
it
did
have
discretion
involving
unnecessary
delay,
but
they
said
in
this
case
devex
has
done
no
more
than
fully
litigate
its
claims
achieving
a
large
judgment
in
its
favor.
the
court
thus
sees
no
reason
for
following
gm...
for
relieving
gm,
whose
infringement
necessitated
this
case
from
the
normal
responsibilities
of
a
wrongdoer.
i
thank
you.
