justice

white
was
that
the
only
change
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--was
that
sentence
otherwise
changed?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
you
take
your
own
course.
tell
me,
mr.
frost,
before
1946,
were
costs
allowed
as
a
matter
of
course?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
house
version
had
passed?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
didn't
the
senate
report
supporting
the
bill
specifically
approve
the
house
version?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
adopted
the
house
report,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
careless
can
you
get?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
was
the
same...
that
same
report
didn't
agree
with
the
house
version
on
the
attorneys'
fees
statement,
and
so
they
redrafted
it.
it
is
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
certainly
didn't
change
their
report
with
respect
to
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
taken
in
context,
i
would
think
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--how
can
you
just
ignore
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
intended
to
change
the
duplate
law.
it
seems
to
me
both
the
house
and
the
senate
report
clearly
indicate
some
evidence
of
an
attempt
to
change
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
different
from
the
later
senate
report?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume--
--he
could
have
added...
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
go
ahead.
he
could
have...
justice
brennan
could...
the
majority
could
have
added
that
the...
quoted
from
the
house
report
and
said,
agreed
to
by
the
senate.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
repeated
in
the
senate
report.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
adopted
the
house--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
adopted
the
house
report.
justice
byron
r.
white
very
well.
could
i...
suppose
the
statute
as
passed
read
as
the...
was
the
house
version.
suppose
that.
wouldn't
it
still
be
possible
under
that
statute
to
deny
interest
from
the
date
of
the
violation,
if
the
equities
were
sufficiently
strong?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you?
so
no
discretion
whatsoever
in...
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
damages,
isn't
it?
isn't
it
compensation?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
damages,
but
it
is
supposed
to
be
measured
by
how
much
you
are
hurt.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
then
it
says,
together
with
interest
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
it
is
still
supposed
to
be
compensation
and
damages,
isn't
it?
it's
the
injury.
it's
not
profits.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
were
able
to
prove,
for
example,
that
the
plaintiff
in
this
suit,
or
that
your
opposition...
it
was
the
plaintiff
in
this
suit--
justice
byron
r.
white
--had
unconscionably
delayed
the
suit,
can
anybody
claim
that
during
that
period
that
you
had
injured
them,
that
your
client
had
injured
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
didn't
arise.
i
am
just
questioning
whether
there
is
room
for
that
sort
of
a
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
thanks
a
lot.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there
is
room
for
your
second
ground
under
the...
suppose
we
agreed
with
you
that
the
statute
should
be
read
as
though
it
had
the
house
words
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
below
agree
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
saying
that
they
adopted
your
first--
justice
byron
r.
white
--submission
rather
than
your--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
that
the
only
language
that
had
appeared
in
either
bill,
either
the
senate
or
the
house,
was
the
language
that
is
now
in
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
"as
fixed
by
the
court".
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
the
ordinary
reading
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
you
say
that
"as
fixed
by
the
court"
wouldn't
apply
to
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only...
but
you
say
only
as
to
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
it
could
have
said,
"interest
as
fixed
by
the
court,
and
cost
as
fixed
by
the
court.
"
but
instead
it
just
said
"interest
and
costs
as
fixed
by
the
court.
"
