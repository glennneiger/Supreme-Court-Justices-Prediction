mr.
george
e.
frost
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
patent
infringement
case.
the
patent
is
to
a
process
of
making
bumpers
and
other
products
by
cold
forming.
the
issue
is
whether
the
court
below
properly
awarded
prejudgment
interest.
the
case
was
filed
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
in--
mr.
george
e.
frost
--no,
there
isn't,
your
honor.
the
patent
expired
more
than
a
decade
ago.
the
case
was
filed
in
1956
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
twenty-four
years
later,
and
after
a
number
of
conflicting
decisions
on
both
validity
and
the
patent
scope,
the
district
court
of
delaware
entered
judgment
on
the
accounting.
it
assessed
prejudgment
interests
of
about
$11
million
against
general
motors.
interest
was
charged
at
the
commercial
bond
rates
from
the
dates
the
infringement
was
held
to
have
occurred.
the
specific
question
presented
on
certiorari
here
is
whether
the
applicable
statute,
35
usc
284,
requires
the
award
of
prejudgment
interest
on
unliquidated
damages
based
on
reasonable
royalties,
where
there
is
a
finding
that
the
defendant
acted
in
good
faith
and
not
recklessly.
mr.
george
e.
frost
no.
if
the
court
please,
the
first
question
here
is
whether
it
requires
it.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
interest
was
mandatory.
then
we
go
on
to
the
question
of
whether
the
duplate
versus
triplex
case
is
still
the
law,
and
finally,
to
the
influence
of
the
georgia
pacific
case,
which
i
will
mention
in
a
few
moments.
the
statute
provides
that
in
patent
cases,
the
court
shall
award
damages
adequate
to
compensate
for
infringement,
but
no
event
less
than
a
reasonable
royalty,
together
with
interest
and
costs
as
fixed
by
the
court.
it
is
the
direct
successor
to
the
1946
patent
act.
the
act
provided
for
interest
in
similar
language...
the
1946
act
provided
for
interest
in
similar
language,
and
it
was
the
first
reference
to
interest
in
the
patent
statutes.
the
key
factor
in
this
case
is
that
the
initial
form
of
the
1946
act
explicitly
required
the
award
of
prejudgment
interest.
as
proposed,
the
court
would
be
required
to
award
damages
which
shall
be
due
compensation
for
infringement,
but
not
less
than
a
reasonable
royalty,
together
with
interest
from
the
time
the
infringement
occurred.
it
was
in
that
form
that
the
statute
actually
passed
the
house
of
representatives,
but
in
the
senate,
this
language
was
rejected.
the
senate
struck
the
reference
to
interest
from
the
time
the
infringement
occurred.
in
its
place,
the
senate
substituted
the
expression,
"interest
as
may
be
fixed
by
the
court.
"
and
it
was
in
this
amended
form
that
the
act
was
passed
by
both
houses
of
congress
and
signed
by
the
president.
mr.
george
e.
frost
there
are
other
changes
unrelated
to
this
particular
item,
dealing
with
attorney
fees
and
things
of
that
kind.
yes,
there
are
a
few
other
changes.
mr.
george
e.
frost
only
in
connection
with
the
format
of
the
attorneys'
fees,
yes,
but
it
was
not...
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
prejudgment
interest
part
of
the
language.
i
have
got
it
here.
i
could
run
through
it
quickly,
but
it--
mr.
george
e.
frost
--yes,
they
were,
your
honor.
in
accordance
with
the
general
way
that
they
are
in
all
cases.
mr.
george
e.
frost
same.
mr.
george
e.
frost
yes.
mr.
george
e.
frost
yes.
mr.
george
e.
frost
yes,
they
are
allowed
as
a
matter
of
course,
and
i
might
say,
your
honor--
mr.
george
e.
frost
--because
there
is
a
settled
rule
before
the
act
on
both
costs
and
interests,
and
they
are
together
because
as
to
that
phase
of
the
act,
it
preserved
the
existing
law.
mr.
george
e.
frost
the
law
as
to
interest
was
this
court's
duplate
versus
triplex
case,
which
required
exceptional
circumstances,
meaning
bad
faith
conduct
of
the
defendant.
coming
over
to
attorneys'
fees,
the
provision
on
attorneys'
fees
was
a
new
provision
in
the
act,
and
the
way
the
act
is
set
up,
it
is
very
clear
that
that
is
expressly
stated
to
be
discretionary,
unlike
the
case
of
interests
and
costs
which
in
each
instance
there
was
a
settled
rule,
and
the
construction
of
the
act
indicates
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
that
that
rule
be
followed.
now,
coming
to
the
1952
patent
code,
it
did
codify
the
patent
law,
and
section
254
of
the
code
replaced
the
law
on
recoveries
previously
covered
by
the
1946
act.
the
language
closely
follows
the
1946
act.
the
revisor
notes
on
the
code
point
out
that
the
code
only
made
some
changes
in
language
at
that
point,
and
plaintiffs
here
concede
that
section
284
was
not
intended
to
change
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
1946
act.
the
error
of
the
court
below
commenced
with
its
misapplication
of
the
dictum
of
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
aro
versus
convertible
top,
377
us.
in
that
case,
four
justices
of
this
court
examined
the
basis
for
recoveries
for
patent
infringement
under
35
usc
284.
the
issue
of
concern
was
whether
the
profits
of
the
infringer
or
damages
to
the
patentee
are
the
measure
of
recovery.
in
explaining
the
effect
of
the
1946
act,
they
quoted
the
house
report
on
the
bill
that
became
the
1946
act.
at
the
time
the
house
report
was
made,
the
bill
included
the
later
rejected
interest
language.
the
portion
of
the
report
quoted
in
the
opinion
included
this
then
existing
language
on
interest.
the
inclusion
of
this
language
did
not
relate
to
any
issue
being
considered
by
this
court.
there
is
no
issue
in
the
case
on
prejudgment
interest.
the
courts
of
appeal
for
the
sixth,
second,
and
seventh
circuits
have
specifically
held
that
the
quotation
in
the
aro
case
is
not
controlling,
and
that
the
statute
does
not
compel
prejudgment
interest.
the
court
below
stands
alone
in
holding
that
the
aro
quotation
controls
and
in
relying
upon
it
to
compel
interest
in
a
reasonable
royalty
case,
notwithstanding
the
history
of
the
statute.
to
be
sure,
the
court
added
to
its
reference
to
aro
by
seeking
to
justify
the
award
of
prejudgment
interest
because
the
defendant
had
the
use
of
the
royalty
money
in
the
time
between
the
dates
that
infringement
was
held
to
take
place
and
the
time
of
judgment.
but
this
is
true
in
every
case.
there
is
always
a
span
of
time
between
the
date
of
an
infringement
and
the
date
of
a
judgment
awarding
damages.
if
interest
is
allowable
in
this
case,
for
this
reason,
it
is
allowable
in
every
case.
in
short,
this
reason
only
adds
to
the
basic
error
of
misapplying
the
dictum
in
the
aro
case
instead
of
looking
to
the
act
as
passed.
the
judgment
should
be
reversed,
because
the
decision
below
is
based
on
a
mandatory
interest
requirement
that
congress
rejected
and
is
clearly
contrary
to
the
statute.
now,
the
history
of
the
1946
act
also
answers
other
questions
in
this
case.
devex
contends
that
the
term
35
usc
284
requires
prejudgment
interest.
but
the
1946
act
as
it
was
passed
by
the
house
and
reached
the
senate
provided
for
due
compensation,
not
less
than
a
reasonably
royalty,
using
that
very
term,
and
the
statute
or
post
statute
at
that
time
also
used
explicitly
required
interest
from
the
time
infringement
occurred.
after
the
senate
amendments,
the
reference
to
due
compensation
not
less
than
a
reasonable
royalty
remained
in
the
statute,
and
the
words
"interest
as
may
be
fixed
by
the
court.
"
were
substituted
for
"interest
from
the
time
the
infringement
occurred.
"
now,
whether
we
take
the
time
before
the
amendment
or
after,
the
term
"due
compensation"
obviously
was
not
used
in
a
sense
of
requiring
interest.
otherwise,
why
the
explicit
reference
to
interest
from
the
time
the
infringement
occurred
before
the
amendment,
and
why
the
reference
to
the
interest
as
may
be
fixed
by
the
court
after
the
amendment?
at
no
point
in
the
history
was
due
compensation
treated
as
if
it
required
interest,
and
the
same
is
true
of
damages
adequate
to
compensate
as
the
term
is
used
in
35
usc
284.
now,
the
history
in
the
text
of
the
1946
patent
act
also
compels
the
conclusion
that
the
act
codified
the
pre-existing
decisions
on
prejudgment
interest
in
patent
cases.
prior
to
the
1946
act,
this
court
had
rendered
a
number
of
decisions
on
prejudgment
interest
in
patent
cases.
the
key
decision
was
duplate
versus
triplex,
decided
in
1936.
there,
as
here,
there
was
a
reasonable
royalty
which
was
the
basis
upon
which
the
damages
were
awarded.
this
court,
reversing
the
court
below,
held
that
interest
on
a
judgment
for
unliquidated
reasonable
royalty
damages
begins
on
the
date
of
liquidation
of
damages
unless
exceptional
circumstances
are
found
to
be
present.
now,
there
is
no
indication
that
the
congress
intended
to
change
this
existing
law
on
prejudgment
interest.
mr.
george
e.
frost
had
the
house
version
passed,
there
would
be
no
question
that
duplate
versus
triplex
would
be
changed.
mr.
george
e.
frost
i
don't
think
it
did,
your
honor,
at
all.
it
did...
what
it
did
do--
mr.
george
e.
frost
--well,
they
rather
carelessly
quoted
it,
yes,
sir,
but
i
think
when
you
take
the
whole
record--
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
george
e.
frost
well,
this
careless,
if
your
honor
please.
if
you
look
at
the
front
part
of
that
report,
it
is
very,
very
clear
the
changes
that
were
made
right
in
that
very
portion
of
the
statute,
and
to
have...
to
take
the
house--
mr.
george
e.
frost
--yes.
mr.
george
e.
frost
they
simply
quoted
the
totality
of
the
house
report,
and
we
think
that
taken
in
context,
your
honor,
that
that
does
not
indicate
intent
otherwise.
mr.
george
e.
frost
now,
i
might
add
one
thing.
mr.
george
e.
frost
i
am
not
asking
that
the
court
ignore
it,
but
i
do
think
there
is
a
time
to
take
the
context--
mr.
george
e.
frost
--well,
let
me
go
on
just
a
second
if
i
may,
your
honor.
the
bill
came
up
on
the
senate
floor,
and
this
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
and
senator
pepper,
who
was
chairman
of
the
senate
committee,
was
asked
to
explain
the
bill,
and
it
is
very
clear
in
that.
he
explained
what
the
changes
were.
one,
two,
three.
not
saying
one
word
of
interest.
then
he
is
asked,
has
the
senator
explained
all
the
changes
made
by
the
bill,
meaning,
of
course,
the
bill
as
amended,
and
he
said,
yes.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
very
clear.
and
it
is--
mr.
george
e.
frost
--yes?
mr.
george
e.
frost
i
think
that--
mr.
george
e.
frost
--i
think
it
was.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
frost
the...
what
happened
was
this.
mr.
george
e.
frost
no,
not
at
all.
what
actually
happens
is
this,
your
honor.
in
the
aro
case,
you
are
concerned
with
whether
the
bill,
the
1946
act
changed
the
rule
on
recoveries
in
patent
infringement
cases,
the
difference
being
between
damages
and...
both
damages
and
profits
of
the
infringer.
and
in
addressing
that,
your
honor
did
just
exactly
what
seems
to
me
the
logical
thing
to
do
is
go
to
the
house
report,
and
on
that
point
the
house
report
was
entirely
accurate
and
meaningful,
and
all
that
happened--
mr.
george
e.
frost
--in
that
respect.
in
that
respect,
no.
mr.
george
e.
frost
well,
i
think
if
your
honor
will
check
it,
you
will
see
that
for
the
purpose
it
was
quoted,
that
is,
the
question
of
damages
versus
profits
to
the
infringer,
and
that
was
the
only
question
in
the
case,
the
only
reason
it
was
quoted,
the
quotation
was
perfectly
correct.
mr.
george
e.
frost
agreed
to
on
the--
mr.
george
e.
frost
--well,
i
think
repeated
in
the
senate
report
is--
mr.
george
e.
frost
--getting
us
back
to
that--
mr.
george
e.
frost
--the
senate
report
in
its
first
paragraphs
states
very
specifically
the
changes
in
the
act,
and
what
you
have
reference
to,
your
honor,
is
a
quotation
of
the
house
report
in
its
totality,
which
is
unselective,
and
it
seems
to
us
it
has
to
be
taken
in
the
context
of
the
change
that
was
actually
made.
mr.
chief
justice,
do
you
have
a
question?
mr.
george
e.
frost
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
frost
i
think
they
do,
your
honor,
and
let
me
explain.
mr.
george
e.
frost
in
the
first
place,
general
motors'
conduct
was
in
good
faith,
not
reckless.
then
it
seems
to
me
that
we
should
turn
to
the
question
of
the
conduct
of
devex
here,
and
particularly
the
conduct
of
devex
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
delays
that
took
place
in
this
case.
obviously,
we
are
dealing
with
a
case
here
that
was
a
protracted
case.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
key
point
here
is,
how
did
the
conduct
of
devex
pertain
to
that
factor?
and
in
two
respect,
we
think
it
very
clearly
was
contrary
to
allowing
prejudgment
interest.
and
the
two
respects
are,
first,
the
venue
question.
the
case
was
filed
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
and
there
was
an
early
hearing
on
venue.
devex
was
fully
aware
of
the
facts,
and
it
then
sidestepped
venue,
went
through
a
trial
on
validity,
and
then
almost
ten
years
later
moved
to
shift
the
case
to
delaware,
which
motion
was
successful,
was
done,
but
certainly
delayed
the
case.
the
second
thing
that
occurred
here
was
the
patent
claim
itself.
the
patent
claim
was
broad
and
sweeping
and
invalid
as
literally
construed.
this
is
exactly
what
judge
robson
held
in
around
1960,
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
that
finally,
but
it
did
give
the
claim
a
narrow
and
restricted
construction.
it
rewrote
the
claim.
the
effect
of
that
rewriting
of
the
claim
was
to
make
it
impossible
to
know
exactly
what
the
claim
did
cover,
with
one
exception.
in
their
briefs,
the
plaintiffs
wrote...
this
is
in
the
court
of
appeals...
"if
defendants
want
to
avoid
infringement,
all
they
need
to
do
is
leave
out
the
borax.
"
that
is
the
literal
language
that
was
in
their
brief.
now,
the
delays
that
occurred
in
this
case
had
in
great
measure
dealt
with
the...
resolving
the
questions
of
what
was
left
of
the
patent,
what
it
did
cover,
and
the...
one
of
those
issues
had
to
do
with
leaving
out
the
borax.
what
happens
if
it
is
something
other
than
borax?
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
validated
the
patent
because
of
special
chemical
coaction
between
the
borax
and
the
other
ingredients,
so
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
made,
notwithstanding
the
broad
language
of
the
claim,
it
just
made
inevitable
the
decisions
that
later
followed
having
to
do
with
the
scope
of
the
patent.
so,
we
think
that
in
this
case,
starting
out
with
the
conduct
of
general
motors,
it
has
been
found
to
be
in
good
faith
and
not
reckless,
and
there
is
no
such
finding
for
the
plaintiffs,
and
when
you
measure
what
the
plaintiffs
did,
it
had
the
effect
of
extending
the
case
far
longer
than
had
to
be.
now,
bear
in
mind
that
the
language
of
that
patent
claim
was
chosen
by
the
plaintiffs,
not
by
gm,
and
that
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
they
might
in
the
end
win
on
various
issues,
but
rather,
was
it
the
consequence
of
something
they
did
that
prolonged
the
duration
of
this
case,
and
we
think
clearly
it
was.
now,
i
just
want
to
add
that
with
respect
to
the
duplate
rule
of
this
court,
there
is
plenty
of
good
reasons
in
favor
of
the
rule
as
announced
by
this
court.
now,
the
court
did...
the
congress
did
in
the
act
of
course
inject
itself
into
the
patent...
into
the
patent
law,
and
to
that
extent
it's
replaced
the
duplate
case
as
such,
but
we
brought
it
out
in
their
brief.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
the
duplate
rule
is
a
very
good
one,
the
first
one
being,
it
puts
the
heat
on
the
defendant...
plaintiff
to
keep
things
moving.
it
makes
the
defendant
follow
reasonable,
good
faith
conduct.
it
fits
with
the
public
interest
in
patent
cases.
and
finally,
the
distinction
between
liquidated
and
unliquidated
damages
is
specifically
important
in
patent
cases.
in
this
case,
it
was
1980,
and
we
have
a
master
and
a
district
court
that
could
not
agree
on
either
what
the
patent
covered
or
what
the
reasonable
royalty
was.
unless
there
is
some
question,
i
would
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
frost
i
have
difficulty
with
that
right
off.
mr.
george
e.
frost
that's...
yes,
your
honor.
that's
as
i
read
it.
there
are
areas
in
this
where
the
equity
comes
in.
the
junction,
for
example.
and
things
of
that
kind.
mr.
george
e.
frost
well,
it's
damages,
and
the
statute
specifically--
mr.
george
e.
frost
--well,
the
statute
says
not
less
than
a
reasonable
royalty.
that
is
the
floor
the
statute
puts
under
the
damages.
mr.
george
e.
frost
the
other
such
interest
as
the
court
may
allow,
yes.
mr.
george
e.
frost
it's
not
profits.
that's
for
sure.
mr.
george
e.
frost
right.
mr.
george
e.
frost
that
question
did
not
arise,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
frost
frankly,
i
hadn't
thought
about
it
that
way.
mr.
george
e.
frost
that
is
the
only
answer
i
can
give
you.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
george
e.
frost
yes,
i
do
have
a
few
things,
your
honor.
first
off,
on
the
last
point,
the
reference
was
to
the
costs
and
the
costs
involved
in
the
accounting
itself.
and
that
finding
had
nothing
to
do
with
earlier
proceedings
in
the
case.
on
the.75
percent
royalty,
the
master
specifically
found
that
the
royalty
rate
was
too
high.
he
went
into
the
subject
of
the
conditions
at
the
time
of
that
offer,
and
he
specifically
so
held.
houdi,
the
defendant
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
whose
case
was
separated,
went
to
soap
only
immediately
after
the
1973...
'63
seventh
circuit
decision.
general
motors
discontinued
using
borax
in
its
processes,
and
the
only
thing
left
after
that
time
was
the
so-called
tkpp
lubricants,
which
did
not
use
borax
and
were
within
the
category
of
lubricants
where
general
motors
really
did
leave
out
the
borax.
we
were
using
the
tkpp
lubricants
in
our
bumper
operations
beginning
around
1963,
and
by
the
time...
oh,
by
'65
it
was
100
percent.
now,
there
is
another
point
with
respect
to
this
marvel
case
that
has
been
mentioned,
and
it
brings
out
this.
there
is
a
difference
between
reasonable
royalties
and
established
royalties,
and
the
decisions
prior
to
the
1946
act
made
it
very
clear
that
where
you
have
a
situation
where
the
patent
is
generally
licensed
at
generally
uniform
rates,
so
much
so
that
there
is
an
established
royalty,
that
in
that
case
the
patentee
cannot
recover
any
greater
sum
than
the
established
royalties,
but
in
that
case
the
damages
are
in
effect
liquidated,
and
therefore
prejudged
interest
should
be
allowed.
that
is
what
happened
in
the
marvel
case,
and
the
reference
to
the
change
in
the
statute
in
that
case
and
the
aro
quotation
was
on
an
entirely
different
factual
setting
for
just
that
reason.
reference
has
been
made
to
the
us
code,
and
as
i
recall
it
was
the
1946
edition.
in
any
event,
that
is
not
an
official
compilation
of
the
law
at
all.
if
you
look
at
the
front
part,
it
very
clearly
states
it
was
prepared
by
west
publishing
company
and
several
other
contractors,
and
the
committee
very
carefully
states
that
it
is
only
prima
facie
law.
now,
lastly,
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
there
has
been
no
reason
at
all
for
the
senate
to
have
changed
the
text
of
the
bill
that
became
the
1946
act
if
it
was
satisfied
with
mandatory
interest.
there
is
no
other
possible
explanation
than
what
the
senate
did
was
to
recognize
that
requirement
of
interest
from
the
time
of
infringement
as
being
not
what
it
wanted.
unless
there
is
further
question,
i
will
conclude.
