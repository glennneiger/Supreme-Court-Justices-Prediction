justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bender,
may
i
ask,
if
you
looked
at
the
statute
just
literally
for
the
moment,
and
left
out
the
"but"
clause,
the
"but
in
no
event"
clause,
just
had
it,
damages...
leave
out
the
reasonable
royalty
floor,
just
said
"damages
adequate
to
compensate
for
the
infringement
together
with
interest
and
costs.
"
would
it
be
perfectly
clear
to
you
that
the
interest
would
be
prejudgment
interest?

--that
language
you
quote
on
page

of
your
brief,
do
you
know
who
wrote
that?
was
that
one
of
mr.
federico's
commentaries?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens

suppose
that
is
often
true,
but
isn't
it
true
that
you
did
offer
a
lower
rate,
your
rates
to
your
others
was
lower,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
you
settle
with
other
people
at
a
lower
rate?
justice
john
paul
stevens

lower
rates.

offer
was
made?
