justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
now
deceased,
did
you
say?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
does
dr.
grigson
practice?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
has
the
medical
association
ever
zeroed
in
on
him?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
don't
think
i
follow
you,
mr.
becker.
if
they
got
out
of
death
row,
they
shouldn't
have
been
there
in
the
first
place.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
the
state
of
texas
was
wrong.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if.
your
assumption
is
that
it
was
wrong.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
all
right.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
somewhere
in
your
argument
i
trust
you
will
tell
me
why
the
district
court
issued
a
certificate
of
probable
cause.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
that
mean
that
he
should
not
have
issued
a
certificate
of
probable
cause?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
there
certainly
is
a
great
pyhrric
victory,
isn't
it,
to
get
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
only
to
be
executed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
becker,
don't
misunderstand
me.
i
am
sympathetic,
and
have
said
so
in
published
opinions,
to
this
intolerable
delay,
but
i
think
one
hurdle
you
have
is
the
fact
that
some
federal
judge
has
issued
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
and
i
think
what
you
are
saying
really
is
that
he
shouldn't
have
issued
it,
and
if
he
had
not
issued
it,
you
would
have
an
entirely
different
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
texas
law
is
alone
in
its
provisions,
isn't
it?
there
is
no
other
state
law
like
this
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
many?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
five
out
of
50?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
who
are
you
using
now
that
dr.
holbrook
is
gone?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
using
just
dr.
grigson
in
all
these
cases?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
he
has
been
here
in
every
case
we
have
had
from
texas.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
he
had
no
other
alternative.
the
evidence
was
admitted.
that
was
the
only
thing
that
he
had
to
say.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
can't
criticize
him
for
having
done
this.
