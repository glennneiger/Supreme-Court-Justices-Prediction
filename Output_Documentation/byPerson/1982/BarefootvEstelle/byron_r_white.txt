justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
held
the
introduction
of
this
kind
of
testimony
to
be
unconstitutional,
it
would
be
on
the
ground,
i
suppose,
that
it
is
just
too
unreliable,
as
the
association
says.
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
an
assertion
then
that
the
whole
notion
of
predicting
future
dangerousness
is
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
that
just
means
overturning
part
of
jurek.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are...
don't
we
have
to,
to
agree
with
you,
don't
we
have
to
reverse
part
of
jurek,
because
we
seem
to...
the
court
seems
to
have
accepted
there
the
notion
of
this
prediction,
and
if
it
is
so
uncertain
that
even
a
psychiatrist
can't
testify
to
it,
you
would
think
its
use
as
a
basis
for
imposing
the
death
penalty
would
be
completely
unconstitutional
in
itself,
but
that
isn't
what
jurek
held.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
the
specific
one,
but
we
must
not
have
thought
that...
or
the
court
must
not
have
thought
that
it
was
a...
that
the
prediction
was
so
uncertain
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be.
that's
a
different
point.
that's
a
different...
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
different
point--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you
are
suggesting
to
us
that
no
psychiatric
testimony
may
be
used
because
the
business
of
prediction
is
unconstitutionally
uncertain.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
that
is
your
submission.
justice
byron
r.
white
sort
of?
i
don't
know
how
else...
what
else
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
may
be.
that
may
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
their
submission
is
that
it
is
too
uncertain
for
them
to
testify
about
it,
that
the
testimony
is
utterly
meaningless.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
hence
the
whole
business
of
prediction,
predicting
future
dangerousness
is
just
out
of
bounds.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
if
that
is
the
case,
it
seems
to
me
you
would
have
to
tear
up
part
of
jurek.
and
some
federal
statutes
which
now,
after
a
conviction
or
a
determination
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
and
when
the
defendant
is
placed
in
a
mental
institution,
he
stays
there
until
he
can
demonstrate
that
his
release
will
not
be
dangerous.
are
you
saying
that
then
they
must
be
committed
there
permanently
if
you
don't
admit
any
testimony
on
the
subject?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't...
if
you
are
going
to
release
them,
it
isn't
very
short
range.
if
it
is
just
going
to
be
testimony
that
he
is
no
longer
dangerous,
if
he
ever
was,
that
is
pretty--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
also,
just
remember
that
one
of
the
standards
for
a
civil
commitment
is
whether
a
person
is
dangerous
to
himself
or
others.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
were
making
a
submission
based
on
dr.
grigson,
that
might
be
one
thing,
but
you
are
making
a
general
submission
here.
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
if
the
testimony
in
this
case
had
been
presented
by
the
president
of
the
american
psychiatric
society.
you
would
be
making
exactly
the
same
submission.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
did
summarily
deal
with
the
merits,
and
their
ultimate
conclusion
was
that
there
was
no
semblance
of
merit
to
any
of
the
issues.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
did
address
the
merits--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
wasn't
the
normal...
it
wasn't
the
normal
time
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
been
justified
in
terms
of
the
procedures
that
it
followed
in
concluding...
in
concluding...
well,
it
concluded...
i
will
start
that
way...
it
concluded
the
motion
for
stay
should
be
denied.
that
was
its
last
few
words,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
could
as
well
have
concluded
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
you
think,
then,
that
it
really
considered
the
merits
of
the
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
why
didn't
they...
why
didn't
they...
why
didn't
they
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
implies
there
was
something
left
to
be
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is...
and
you
are
defending
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
certainly
part
of
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
could
possibly
deny
the
stay
without
also
ruling
on
the
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
tell
me,
what
would
have
been
wrong,
what
would
have
been
legally
wrong
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
concluded
on
the
merits
of
the
appeal
that
the
judgment
is
affirmed?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
what
would
have
been
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
you
think
he
was
on
notice...
you
claim
he
was
on
notice
that
he
was
going
to
have
to
address
the
merits.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
couldn't
show
he
had
an
issue
that
had
any
semblance
of
merit,
why
didn't...
why
would
you
suggest
it
would
be
wrong
for
the
court
of
appeals
just
to
affirm?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wasn't,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
is
consistent
with
garrison?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
garrison
suggests...
said
you
could
use
summary
procedures,
and
you
could
collapse...
you
could
collapse
the
question
of
stay
and
the
merits,
but
it
never
suggested
that
you
could
avoid
ruling
on
the
merits
with
finality,
and
there
was
no
ruling
on
the
merits
with
finality
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
happen
to
the
appeal?
whatever
happened
with
barefoot's
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then...
and
then
it
would
just
be
dismissed
as
moot,
i
take
it.
