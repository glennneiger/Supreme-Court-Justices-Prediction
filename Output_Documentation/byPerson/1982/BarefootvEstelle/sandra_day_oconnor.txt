mr.
greenberg,
i
know
you
stress
first
application,
but
there
just
isn't
anything
in
the
rules
or
the
statute
that
refer
to
the
first
application,
and
i--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--distinguish.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
nothing
as
far
as
the
rules
concerning
the
stay
are
concerned
that
would
limit
it
to
a
first
application.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
i
think
we
have
to
be
conscious
of
the
fact
that
there
are
successive
petitions
typically
filed,
and
we
will
have
to
address
this
for
successive
petitions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
couldn't
you
put
someone
on
the
stand
to
say
so?
that
it
is
improper
in
their
view
to
present
that
kind
of
testimony?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
could
do
that,
could
you
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
state
of
texas
not
pay
for
expert
witnesses
for
a
defendant
in
a
capital
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
you
can
bring
that
out
on
cross
examination
and
let
the
jury
know
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
do
that,
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
just
seems
so
illogical
to
have
a
different
standard
for
when
you
issue
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
than
you
do
for
the
issuance
of
a
stay
so
that
issue
can
be
resolved.
i
just
don't
see
how
you
would
argue
for
a
different
standard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
neither
one
of
them
articulate
the
standard.
