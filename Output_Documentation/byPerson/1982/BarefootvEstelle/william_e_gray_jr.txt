mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
state
in
this
case
put
on
at
the
guilt
stage
of
the
trial...
texas
has
a
bifurcated
procedure
in
capital
cases...
put
on
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
later
incorporated
in
the
hypothetical
questions
to
two
psychiatrists.
they
put
on
evidence
of
prior
convictions.
at
the
punishment
hearing,
they
put
on
evidence...
well,
they
put
that
on
at
the
punishment
hearing,
prior
convictions
for
two
firearm
cases
and
three
drug-related
cases.
they
put
on
testimony
at
the
guilt
stage
of
the
trial
about...
at
least
they
introduced
the
testimony
of
some
charges
in
new
mexico
involving
rape
and
kidnapping
of
a
child
under
13.
at
the
punishment
stage,
they
put
on
evidence
of
the
defendant's
bad
reputation.
this
testimony
came
in
from
police
officers
who
had
handled
the
petitioner
on
these
drug-related
cases,
on
the
firearm
cases,
and
on
no
cases
relating
to
violent
crimes.
the
prosecutor
then
incorporated
all
of
the
evidence
that
had
already
been
heard
by
the
jury
in
the
hypothetical
questions
to
two
psychiatrists,
dr.
grigson,
who
has
represented
the
state
in
probably
75
to
100
cases,
and
dr.
holbrook,
who
is
now
deceased.
both
of
these
psychiatrists--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
he
committed
suicide.
the
critical
nature
of
this
type
of
testimony
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
texas
procedure,
because
the
issue
of
whether
a
defendant
lives
or
dies
is
based
upon
one
fact
issue,
and
that
is
whether
in
the
opinion
of
the
jury
he
will
constitute
a
future
danger
to
society.
dr.
grigson
testified
in
answer
to
this
hypothetical
question
that
it
was
100
percent
and
absolute,
in
his...
he
didn't
even
say
in
his
opinion.
he
just
said
100
percent
and
absolute
that
this
defendant
would
constitute
a
continuing
danger
to
society.
dr.
holbrook
was
almost
as
emphatic.
that
removes
any
discretion
that
the
jury
that
heard
this
case
may
have
had
in
determining
whether
mr.
barefoot
lived
or
died.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
they...
well,
not
under
the...
there
is
nothing
a
defendant
can
present
under
the
texas
procedure
in
mitigation
of
punishment
unless
it
bears
directly
on
future
dangerousness,
and
even
then,
when
he
introduces
such
evidence,
there
are
no
provisions
whatsoever
in
the
texas
law
that
the
jury
be
instructed
to
consider
that
mitigating
evidence
or
to
balance
the
mitigating
evidence
against
the
aggravating
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
well--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--you
could
not
do
it
and
protect
a
defendant's
constitutional
rights.
there
is
no
way
it
can
be
done,
because
the
reliable
and
ethical
psychiatric
practitioners
will
not
give
such
testimony
and
will
not--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--all
right.
the
lawyers
in
this
case
tried
to
cross
examine
dr.
grigson.
he
said
he
didn't
recognize
any
of
these
authorities
from
the
american
psychiatric
association
or
any
other
practitioners.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
you
can
argue
it,
but--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--well,
no,
you
can't...
you
can't
present
any
mitigating
evidence,
and
if
you
bring
on...
you
can't
get
any
other
psychiatrist
to
testify,
because
they
don't
believe
that
any
predictions
of
future
dangerousness
can
be
made.
they
feel,
and
the
american
psychiatric--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--well,
then
you
are
not
balancing
one
psychiatric
opinion
against
another.
you
are
just
attacking
the
credentials
of
the--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--you
can
do
that,
surely.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
if
the
lawyers
are
prepared
to
do
so.
but
most
of
the
lawyers
are
court-appointed
in
these
capital
cases
in
texas,
and
they
have
no
funds,
and
it
is
difficult
to
get
a
psychiatrist
to
testify.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
they
will
pay
up
to
$500,
and
you
can't
get
a
psychiatrist
to
come
in
off
the
street
for
$500.
there
is
really
no
adequate
way
that
you
can
remove
the
prejudice
from
this
testimony
by
cross
examination
or
by
putting
on
the
testimony
of
another
psychiatrist.
it
is
just
like
if
the
state
put
on
polygraph
testimony.
you
can't
remove
the
prejudice
from
that
testimony,
that
inadmissible
testimony,
by
putting
on
another
operator,
or
by
cross
examining
that
person.
this
falls
in
that
same
category.
based
on
the
brief
filed
by
the
american
psychiatric
association,
and
based
upon
the
studies
they
have
done,
psychiatrists
are
wrong
more
than
they
are
right
in
their
predictions
of
future
dangerousness.
this
zeros
all
of
the
life
or
death
issues
in
a
capital
case
down
to
that
one
issue,
and
down
to
testimony
from
practitioners
like
grigson
and
holbrook
who
are
absolutely
certain
that
a
defendant...
every
defendant
they
see
will
be
a
future
danger
to
society
if
he
is
charged
with
the
offense
of
capital
murder.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
we
are
objecting...
we
say...
certainly
that
is
the
thrust
of
our
argument,
that
it
should
not
be
admissible.
this
court
has
held
in
jurek
that
a
lay
jury
is
qualified
to
make
that
determination.
in
this
case,
the
lay
jury
had
the
exact
testimony
and
evidence
that
the
psychiatrists
had
in
their
hypothetical
question.
the
psychiatric
opinion
merely
reinforced
that
evidence,
and
gave
a
gloss
of
expertise
to
it,
where
no
expertise
was
required.
it
was
a
decision
that
the
jury
was
competent
to
make
based
on
the
evidence
already
before
them.
it
will
not...
the
state
does
not
have
to
rely
on
psychiatric
testimony
to
prove
the
issue
of
future
dangerousness.
five
other
states
have
a
similar
statute.
none
of
those
utilize
psychiatric
testimony.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
i
am
saying,
given
what
this
court
has
held,
that
a
more
strict
determination
is
required
in
capital
cases,
i
submit
that
it
is
inadmissible.
it
should
be.
it
adds
nothing
except,
as
i
say,
a
gloss
of
expertise
to
lay
testimony.
the
american
psychiatric--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--he
did.
it
wasn't--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--he
did
not
give
his
opinion.
they
used
the
names
of
all
the
witnesses.
they
needed
to
use
the
names
of
mr.
barefoot
and
his
alias.
there
was
no
question
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
that
either
of
these
were
referring
to
the
case
on
trial,
and
that
their
absolute
opinion
was
directly
related
to
the
persons
on
trial.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
they
did
not
examine
him.
they
merely
answered
the
hypothetical
question,
and
that
question
by
the
prosecutor
included
numerous
conclusions
that
he
had
drawn
from
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
that
he
put
on.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
i
don't
know
of
any.
i've
been
searching.
i've
represented
a
number
of
these
people,
and
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
get
them
for
anything
around
that
figure.
and
certainly
not
to
conduct
an
examination.
and
even
if
we
could
get
them,
it
would
be
fruitless
under
the
way
the
texas
statute
is
drawn
and
under
the
way
the
texas
procedure
works,
because
any
psychiatrist
you
get
who
is
a
competent,
ethical
practitioner,
will
not
be
so
absolute
in
his
testimony.
he
can't
be,
because
the
studies
have
shown
that
they
are
not
qualified,
they
are
no
more
qualified
than
the
lay
person
to
make
predictions
of
future
dangerousness.
so,
all
you
can
do
with
those
psychiatrists
is
attack
the
qualifications
of
mr....
dr.
grigson
and
dr.
holbrook
and
similar
practitioners
who--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--he
practices...
i
think
he
has
an
office
in
dallas,
but
he
practices
all
over
the
state,
wherever
the
prosecution
needs
his
type
of
testimony.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
about
that.
but
he,
as
this
court
knows,
has
testified
in
an
inordinate
number
of
capital
cases,
always
for
the
state,
and
his
opinions
are
always
the
same,
whether
he
has
examined
the
people
or
not.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
sure,
you
could
do
that.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
absolutely,
but
that's
just
like
admitting
an
involuntary
confession
and
telling
the
jury
not
to
consider
it.
it
is
something
that
can't
be
removed,
because
these
doctors
are
so
absolute,
and
a
reliable
practitioner
is
not.
they
can't
compete
with
those
people,
because
they
try
to
stay
within
the
guidelines
of
their
profession.
the
prejudice
cannot
be
removed,
and
the
whole
question
comes
down
to
the
jury
relying
on
what
these
doctors
tell
them,
how
they
should
answer
the
question,
a
question
that
this
court
has
held
can
be
answered
by
a
lay
jury.
and
it
is
all
based
on
lay
testimony.
it
is
all
based
on
the
same
evidence
that
the
jury
heard
in
these
hypothetical
situations.
dr.
grigson
has
testified
in
a
number
of
cases
since
this
time,
and
since
smith
was
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
it
would
not
be
admissible
unless
a
state
was
granted
a
collateral
right
to
have
him
examined
by
a
psychiatrist
of
their
own
selection.
the
state
is
certainly
not
going
to
put
on--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--well,
given
what
the
american
psychiatric
association
says
in
their
brief
in
this
case,
and
based
upon
the
studies
that
they
have
made,
this
testimony
even
to
non-dangerousness
would
be
unreliable
and
should
not
be
admissible,
but
i
am
saying
if--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--it
can
be.
it
does
not
work
in
these
cases.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
i'm
saying...
well,
actually,
in
eddings,
this
court
examined
some
psychiatric
testimony
where
the
psychiatrist
had
examined
eddings
for
about
an
hour,
and
drew
some
determinist
conclusions
from
that
examination,
and
i
believe
you,
judge
burger,
chief
justice,
said
that
that
was
fantastic
testimony,
or
something
like
that,
and
you--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--i
understand,
but
this
is
even
more
fantastic
testimony.
there
was
no
examination.
there
was
nothing.
and
it
cannot
be
counted
by
cross
examination.
the
lawyers
in
this
case
tried.
grigson
doesn't
recognize
any
medical
authority.
you
cannot
cross
examine
him
on
the
basis
of
these
prior
studies
or
the
holdings
of
the
american
psychiatric
association.
in
fact,
he
says
they're
a
bunch
of
crackpots
or
something.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know.
i
think
27,000
out
of
the
35,000
belong
to
the
american
psychiatric
association,
and
that
association
is
appearing
in
this
case,
trying
to
point
out
to
this
court,
as
we
are,
that
it
is
futile
to
rely
upon
cross
examination
of
the
adversary
procedure
to
counter
this
type
of
testimony
in
a
capital
case.
there
is
too
much
at
stake.
and
the
jurors
invariably
believe
something
that
is
presented
to
them
as
medical
testimony
by...
even
though
it
is
not
medical
testimony,
as
it
was
not
in
this.
these
were
not
hypothetical
questions.
these
were
fact
questions,
and
even
if
the
court
doesn't
go
far
enough
to
exclude
this
type
of
testimony
in
every
case,
i
think
under
the
facts
of
this
case
it
should
hold
that
the
procedure
used
in
this
particular
case
was
unconstitutional
because
it
was
not
hypothetical.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
absolutely.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--absolutely,
because
i
don't
think
this
court--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--i
think
this
court
didn't
really
examine
this
specific
problem
in
jurek.
in
jurek--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--well,
at
that
time,
it
was
represented
to
this
court
that
the
state
would
permit
the
introduction
of
mitigating
evidence,
and
that
the
jury
would
consider
facts
in
mitigation.
that
has
not
been
what
has
happened
under
the
texas
law
since
jurek
was
decided.
there
are
no--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--well--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--i'm--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--well,
sort
of,
but--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--what
i
am
saying
is,
and
the
american
psychiatric
association
agrees
with
this,
the
psychiatrists
are
wrong
two
out
of
three
times.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
and
lay
persons
are
wrong
two
out
of
three
times.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
it
is,
because--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--i
am
not
saying
that,
your
honor,
and
that's
not
what
the
american
psychiatric
association
is
saying.
they
say
that
they
can
do
that
in
those
cases
where
there
is
not
so
much
at
stake,
but
where
it
is
a
life
or
death
situation,
they
are
not
qualified
to
do
it.
they
are
wrong
two
out
of
three
times,
and
then
if
they
give
that
percentage
of
predictions
to
a
jury,
who
can
make
the
same
determination,
the
jury
would
be
wrong
two
out
of
three
times
also,
so
that
would
multiply
the
odds
of
being
wrong
even
more
than
two
out
of
three
times.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
yes,
there
have
been
a
number
of
studies,
and
they
all
bear
out
that
general...
general
overprediction
by
psychiatrists,
and
when
you
add
that
overprediction
to
testimony
that
the
jurors
are
competent
according
to
this
court
to
determine
and
make
a...
reach
a
decision
on,
it--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
absolutely,
and
i
think
that's
the
thrust
of
the
american
psychiatric
association's
brief
also.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
yes,
and
that's
because
in
those
cases
they
are
only
making
short-range
predictions
of
dangerousness.
in
a
capital
murder
case,
we
are
talking
about
long-range
predictions.
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
but
the
fallacy--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--right,
but
grigson
and
his
compadres
in
texas
have
refined
this
testimony
to
the
point
that
they
testify
100
percent
absolute
that
a
defendant
will
be
a
danger
in
the
penitentiary
also,
so
that--
mr.
william
e.
gray,
jr.
--absolutely,
as
far
as
mr.
barefoot
is
concerned,
but
as
far
the
texas
procedure
generally,
and
the
use
of
psychiatric
testimony,
texas
is
the
only
state
that
utilizes
this
in
capital
cases.
