chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
barefoot
against
estelle.
mr.
greenberg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
a
little
difficulty,
mr.
greenberg,
tracking
the
matter
of
the
substitution
of
the
judge.
how
is
that
relevant
to
any
issue
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
must
be
aware
that,
for
example,
one
justice
of
this
court
for
many
years
came
on
the
bench
without
knowing
anything
but
the
name
of
the
case,
and
did
so
deliberately.
you
suggest
that
disqualifies
a
judge
from
participating?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
a
matter
that
had
been
through
the
state
court
systems
up
to
that
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
gray.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
jury
could
disbelieve
the
testimony,
could
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
representing
to
us,
mr.
gray,
that
in
texas
for
$500
you
could
not
get
a
psychiatrist
to
come
in
and
challenge
the
testimony
of
this
particular
psychiatrist?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
you
view,
mr.
gray,
that
if
a
defendant
at
this
stage
of
the
trial
brought
in
a
psychiatrist
who
testified
that
he
had
examined
the
man,
that
he
had
looked
over
his
entire
record,
and
that
in
his
opinion,
professional
opinion,
he
would
not
be
dangerous,
would
you
say
that
testimony
was
admissible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
are
right
back
to
the
adversary
system,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
as
has
been
suggested
to
you
by
questions
from
the
bench,
that
lack
of
reliability
can
be
laid
before
the
fact-finders,
the
jurors,
both
by
cross
examination
and
by
other
experts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
conclude
from
that
or
do
you
suggest
we
conclude
from
that
that
therefore
it
is
an
unconstitutional
practice
because
it
isn't
successful?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
not
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
not
suggesting
that
all
psychiatrists
agree
with
the
american
psychiatric
association,
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
two
out
of
three
based
on
the
examination
of
cases
where
the
testimony
of
the
psychiatrist
was
that
the
person
would
not
be
dangerous,
and
then
he
went
out
a
committed
other
crimes,
including
murder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
narrowing
your
point
just
to
capital
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
a
psychiatrist
is
to
be
permitted
to
testify
after
a
person
has
been
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
in
a
murder
case,
and
goes
to
st.
elizabeth
hospital,
and
you
would
say
it
is
all
right
for
the
psychiatrist
then
to
testify
60
or
90
days
later
that
his
release
will
not
endanger
the
community?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
becker?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
judges
did
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
mr.
becker,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure.
did
counsel
answer
the
question?
yes.
fine.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
