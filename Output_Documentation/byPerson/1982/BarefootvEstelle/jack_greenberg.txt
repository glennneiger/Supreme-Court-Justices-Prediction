mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
shall
argue
first
as
a
friend
of
the
court
on
the
issue
of
standards
for
granting
stays
of
execution
on
denials
of
petitions
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
capital
case,
and
mr.
gray
shall
argue
for
the
petitioner
on
the
merits
of
the
case
with
regard
to
the
admissibility
of
the
psychiatric
testimony.
i
would
first
like
to
commence
with
a
brief
review
of
the
chronology
of
the
case,
because
it
bears
upon
an
important
issue
with
regard
to
the
stay,
and
that
is
whether
counsel
acted
diligently
or
dilatorily.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
thomas
barefoot,
was
convicted
in
november,
1978,
of
homicide,
and
he
litigated
his
case
in
the
state
courts
on
direct
review,
and
then
to
this
court,
and
then
on
state
post-conviction
relief
for
approximately
three
years,
and
on
october
6th,
1981,
he
completed
his
proceedings
in
the
state
system,
and
less...
approximately
a
week
later,
on
october
14th,
he
filed
his
case
in
the
united
states
district
court.
that
case
was
resolved
a
year
later
in
the
district
court
on
november,
1982,
and
on
december
3rd,
the
district
court
granted
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
permission
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis,
and
on
december
4th
it
vacated
a
stay
which
it
had
theretofore
granted.
shortly
thereafter,
on
december--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--yes.
on
december
20th,
the
district
court
set
the
date
of
execution
for
january
25th,
1983.
texas
has
a
doctrine
which
does
not
permit
litigation
in
its
state
courts
as
long
as
proceedings
are
pending
in
the
federal
courts,
and
some
newly
discovered
evidence
appeared,
as
well
as
an
additional
state
court
matter,
which
had
not
been
exhausted,
and
so
mr.
gray
went
back
into
the
state
courts
on
december
20th
on
state
habeas
corpus
which
was
denied
on
december
21st.
however,
he
was
not
notified
of
this
denial
until
january
7th.
a
week
thereafter,
he
filed
his
petition
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
on
january
14th.
he
received
a
telephone
call
on
january
17th
telling
him
to
appear
for
a
hearing
on
the
application
for
stay
on
january
19th.
he
appeared
in
court
on
january
19th.
the
panel
which
had
judge
brown
on
it
informed
him
that
judge
brown
was
ill
and
judge
randall
was
substituting
for
judge
brown,
and
it
was
stated
in
open
court
that
judge
randall
had
showed
up
at
the
last
moment,
didn't
know
anything
at
all
about
the
case.
the
record
on
the...
of
the
state
court
proceedings
had
not
yet
been
filed
in
federal
court.
the
record
of
the
federal
habeas
court
proceedings
was
just
then
filed.
there
was
a
letter
from
counsel
which
was
turned
over
to
the
court
saying
that
the
american
psychiatric
association
desired
to
file
a
friend
of
the
court
brief
on
the
important
issue
of
the
admissibility
and
the
significance
of
the
psychiatric
testimony
in
this
case,
which
was
based
upon
a
response
to
a
hypothetical
question.
the
hearing
on
the
stay
was
concluded.
twenty-four
hours
later,
a
16-page
opinion
was
issued
denying
the
stay
and
setting
forth
as
a
standard
for
granting
a
denial
of
stay
whether
or
not
petitioner
had
established
a
substantial
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits.
in
essence,
this--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--such
preparation
as
the
judge
might
have
been
able
to
make
even
on
that
short
notice
was
not
possible
for
judge
randall,
who
just
showed
up
at
the
last
moment,
certainly
through
not
fault
of
her
own.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
certainly
was
not
suggesting
it
was
a
disqualification,
but
certainly
it
was
an
indication
of
not
adequate
opportunity
for
study
and
reflection
on
a
matter
that
was
complex
and
difficult.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
matter
had
been
through
the
state
court
system,
but
petitioner
had
a
congressionally
mandated
statutory
right
to
federal
habeas
corpus
review
of
his
constitutional
claims
in
the
federal
courts
and
had
not
yet
had
that.
now,
our
brief
and
others
argue
that
a
stay
should
be
granted
on
appeal
from
appeal
from
denial
of
a
first
application,
i
must
stress,
a
first
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
whenever
petitioner
presents
issue
that
are
not
frivolous
or
has
a
certificate
of
probable
cause.
but
there
are
additional
reasons
which
we
would
like
to
submit
on
this
argument
based
on
policy
why
petitioner's
first
application
should
receive
the
ordinary
consideration
afforded
non-death
sentence
prisoners
who
assert
they
have
been
denied
constitutional
rights
without
having
their
cases
mooted
by
execution.
those--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--but
there
is
something
that
refers
to
second
application,
and
that
is--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--there
is
something
that
refers
to
second
application,
and
that
is
the
rule
9(b)
of
the
rules
governing
federal
habeas
corpus.
if
the
petitioner
is
abusing
the
writ--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--well,
but
he
is
not
going
to
have...
he
is
not
going
to
have
his
hearing
unless
he
gets
a
stay,
because
he
will
be
executed
before
his
case
has
been
heard
on
the
merits,
so
the
two
are
intimately
involved
one
with
another.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
do
not
for
a
moment
suggest
that
a
successive
petition
requires
the
same
consideration
that
an
initial
petition
requires,
although
some
successive
petitions
have
succeeded
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
indeed
in
this
court,
so
they
are
not
all
to
be
viewed
as
automatically--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--i
think
a
successive
petition
deserves
much
more
cursory
treatment.
an
initial
petition
merits
serious
consideration.
these
initial
petitions
have
succeeded
at
the
rate
of
almost
70
to
80
percent
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
these
are
not
frivolous
petitions.
i
would
like
to
just
identify
three
policy
considerations
that
support
the
statutory
argument
made
in
the
various
briefs.
the
first
is
the
interest
of
the
defendant
to
have
his
constitutional
claims
fairly
considered
in
the
same
manner
as
the
claims
of
an
ordinary
embezzler
or
petty
thief.
the
second
is
the
interest
of
the
states
in
maintaining
an
effective
system
of
criminal
justice,
and
the
third
is
the
interest
of
this
court
in
not
only
doing
justice
to
capital
defendants
but
the
total
run
of
business
of
the
federal
courts.
as
to
the
defendants
in
the
capital
cases,
they
are
mostly
represented
by
volunteer
counsel,
public
defenders,
a
few
civil
rights
organizations,
such
as
the
one
for
which
i
work,
which
has
three
or
four
lawyers
working
on
such
cases.
the
cases
are
complex.
the
capacity
of
lawyers
to
present
them
fairly
and
completely
is
now...
we
have
now
gone
totally
beyond
that,
and
if
the
courts
obtain
the
assistance
they
need,
at
a
minimum,
there
should
be
the
time
for
the
ordinary
briefing
and
presentation
of
ordinary
cases.
as
far
as
the
interests
of
the
states
are
concerned,
there
is
one
thing
to
be
said
for
states.
they
are
interested
in
the
administration
of...
fair
administration
of
the
criminal
justice
systems,
capital
punishment
as
a
deterrent,
as
an
appropriate
attributive
device.
i
happen
not
to
agree
with
that.
we
are
required
to
accept.
the
pipeline
is
filled.
executions
are
occurring.
anyone
who
picks
up
the
papers
will
know
that
people
who
commit
homicides
are
being
executed.
if
there
is
a
deterrent
effect
arising
from
executions,
that
deterrent
effect
will
take
place.
so
far
as
the
interest
of
the
federal
judiciary
is
concerned,
this
court
and
other
courts
have
heavy
dockets
of
many
different
kinds
of
cases.
the
counsel
in
those
cases
and
the
parties
in
those
cases
cannot
have
their
cases
fairly
heard
if
they
must
operate
on
a
crash
schedule,
as
mr.
gray
had
to
operate
in
this
case,
compiling
a
complex
record
in
three
days,
the
record
of
the
trial
and
the
record
of
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
not
being
presented
until
one
before
the
hearing
and
the
other
after
the
hearing,
a
difficult
issue
requiring
medical
judgments,
which
was
covered
in
a
brief
by
the
american
psychiatric
association,
which
finally
was
filed
in
this
court.
to
compress
on
a
crash,
rush
basis
the
consideration
of
the
stay
into
the
consideration
of
the
merits,
which
is
what,
of
course,
happens,
because
otherwise
the
case
is
mooted
out
by
the
execution
of
the
defendant
before
he
has
a
hearing
on
the
merits,
does
not
help
the
federal
courts,
does
not
help
criminal
justice,
and
certainly
is
to
the
detriment
of
the
defendant.
we
urge
upon
this
court
a
standard
which
is
that
in
cases
of
a
first
application
for
a
petition
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
that
application
be
considered
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events,
which
may
take
four
to
six
months,
instead
of
the
crash
basis,
which
takes
four
to
six
weeks,
and
that
the
interests
of...
all
the
various
interests
involved
will
be
well
served
and
no
interest
involved
will
be
deserved
by
such
a
procedure.
