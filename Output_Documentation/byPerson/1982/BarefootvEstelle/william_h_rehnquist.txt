justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
greenberg,
do
those
two
actions
strike
you
as
being
at
all
inconsistent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
how
would
you
distinguish
them,
as
opposed
to
just
saying
you
don't
see
why
one
would
have
to
be
treated
the
same
as
the
other
for
stay
purposes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
gray,
couldn't
you
cross
examine
the
psychiatrist
and
on
the
basis
of
your
cross
examination
urge
to
the
jury
that
his
opinion
out
not
to
be
credited
by
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
or
could
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
said
cross
examine.
i
didn't
say
call
a
witness
of
your
own.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can't
you
argue
that
fact
to
the
jury
as
a
reason
for
not
crediting
his
testimony?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
said
you
couldn't
argue
it.
i
thought
you
said
you
couldn't.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
know
right
off
where
that
is
in
the...
is
that
in
one
of
the
briefs
we
have?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
file
a
joint
appendix,
or
who...
somebody?
several
of
us
don't
seem
to
have
a
joint
appendix.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
ahead.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
he
thought...
the
district
judge
thought
the
standard
for
granting
or
vacating
a
stay
was
different
from
the
standard
for
issuing
a
certificate
of
probable
cause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
becker,
if
we
agreed
with
you,
we
would
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
wouldn't
we?
