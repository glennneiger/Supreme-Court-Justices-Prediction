mr.

you
don't
emphasize
the
fact
that
this
first
man
didn't
testify
as
an
expert.
he
testified
as
a
fact.
justice
thurgood
marshall

of
them
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall

was
not...
they
didn't
examine
barefoot?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much
time

it?
justice

justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
what
you
are
talking
about.
you
said
when
the
court
was
considering
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
wasn't
considering
it
100
years
ago.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
can't
you
give
me
a
date?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
assume
you
counted
the
court
of
appeals
each
time,
the
same
judges.
