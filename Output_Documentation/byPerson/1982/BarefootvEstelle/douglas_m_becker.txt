mr.
douglas
m.
becker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
by
way
of
background
upon
the
stay
issue,
i
wish
to
state
at
the
outset,
as
the
court
has
said
in
another
context,
death
is
indeed
different.
the
court
has
said
that
the
imposition
or
the
carrying
out
of
the
death
penalty
is
different.
the
imposition
of
it
is
different
also,
in
the
rather
obvious
following
manner
which
i
think
bears
emphasis.
no
one
is
sentenced
to
be
on
death
row,
and
i
think
we
can
all
agree
that
the
more
than
1,100
persons
now
on
death
row
represents
a
national
tragedy,
but
it
is
a
national
tragedy
that
is
exacerbated
by
the
fact
that
they
sit
there
apparently
interminably
while
their
cases
are
litigated
year
after
year
in
the
appellate
courts.
i
think
that
we
can
all
agree
that
the
effects
of
this
delay
are
terrible.
they
erode
the
public
faith
in
the
judiciary,
promote
the
view
that
the
law
cannot
be
carried
out,
destroy
whatever
deterrent
effect
the
death
penalty
would
otherwise
have,
makes
proof
of
claims
harder
if
retrials
are
necessary,
often
make
retrials
impossible,
and
i
think
that
we
also
agree
that
the
delays
are
very
unfair
to
those
who
are
unconstitutionally
confined
upon
death
row,
who
after
interminable
years
on
death
row
finally
reach
an
adjudication
that
their
conviction
was
unconstitutional
in
the
first
place,
and
now
rehabilitation
must
begin
of
those
individuals
after
the
debilitating
effects
of
being
on
death
row
for
years.
the
attorney
general
of
texas
two
or
three
years
ago
began
filing
motions
to
expedite--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--that's
right,
your
honor.
they
should
never
have
been
convicted.
i
am
saying
if
they
achieve--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--if
the
state
of
texas
was
wrong,
yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
that's
correct.
and
i'm
saying
that
those
persons
ought
to
have
been
in
the
general
population
within
the
prison,
and
enjoying
the
rehabilitative
effects
that
the
general
population
enjoys,
and
should
not
be
incarcerated
on
death
row,
and
the
sooner
that
a
constitutional
adjudication
like
that
can
be
reached,
the
sooner
that
those
rehabilitative
effects
can
be
practiced
upon
the
prisoner.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
your
honor,
it
is
because
he
believed
that
at
least
one
of
the
claims
was
not
frivolous.
i
think
we
know
which
one
it
was,
and
i
think
we
can
tell
from
the
language
why
he
thought
that
was,
and
at
the
same
time
i
can
respond
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
earlier
question
about
the
inconsistency.
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
was
undoubtedly
granted
as
to
the
hypothetical
psychiatric
testimony
issue,
and
i
think
the
language
that
the
district
court
used
showed
what
he
meant.
he
said,
upon
careful
reflection,
or
upon
reflection,
this
ground--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--the
language?
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor,
the
joint
appendix,
which
contains
the
district
court's
opinion,
and
he
said
that
upon
careful
reflection,
the
ground
is
without
merit,
or
completely
without
merit,
and
what
he
meant
was
the
ground
to
him
was
not
frivolous--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--i've
got
one.
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
file
it.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
all
right.
he
said
that
you
couldn't
look
at
the
issue
and
upon
its
face
conclude
that
it
was
frivolous,
but
upon
examination
and
careful
thought,
that
it
was
entirely
without
merit,
and
i
think
that
there
is
only
an
inconsistency
between
the
fact
that...
among
the
two
facts
that
he
granted
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
and
actually,
he
did
not
deny
a
stay
of
execution.
he
granted
the
state's
motion
to
remove
the
stay
of
execution
that
he
had
previously
entered,
the
same
procedural
effect.
and
he
thought
that
even
though
it
was
not
frivolous
upon
its
face,
that
upon
reflection,
it
was
not
a
substantial
issue.
therefore,
he
did
not
stay
the
execution,
and
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
the
matter
the
same
way.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
patently
he
did,
just
as
the
district
court
in
the
brooks
case
thought
the
same
thing,
and
just
as
the
fifth
circuit
judges
have
thought
the
same
thing
and
indeed
said
the
same
thing.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
sir.
we
have
contended
that
the
hypothetical
question
issue
is
not
frivolous,
but
as
we
argued
in
the
fifth
circuit,
it
borders
upon
the
frivolous.
that
is,
we
have
been
unwilling
to
say
it
is
a
frivolous
issue
completely.
it
is
one
that
bears
some
thought,
some
minimal
reflection.
but
upon
making
that
reflection,
every
judge
that
has
considered
it,
which
at
this
point
includes
32
by
my
count,
has
concluded
that
the
issue
is
without
merit,
and
is
totally
without
merit.
therefore,
even
though
it
may
not
be
frivolous,
it
is
without
substance,
and
there
are
a
large
number
of
issues
in
these
cases
that
will
fall
within
that
category.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
because
we
are
under
different
statutes,
your
honor.
the
certificate
of
probable
cause,
as
you
know,
is
governed
by
rule
22,
and
section
2253,
and
the
granting
of
the
stay
is
governed
by
rule
8
of
the
appellate
rules
or
section
2251,
part
28,
depending
on
whose
argument
you
buy
in
the
briefs.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
that's
correct,
but
i
think
there
are
different...
there
are
different
things
involved.
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
is
related
to
what
he
needs
in
order
to
appeal,
but
the
granting
of
the
stay
is
in
effect
the
granting
of
an
injunction
against
a
state
process,
a
state
procedure
that
has
been
supported
by
lengthy
judicial
proceedings,
and
i
think
that
the
granting
of
an
injunction
under
those
circumstances,
whether
it
is
under
rule
8
or
section
2251,
involves
important
comity
interests.
it
involves
calling
a
halt
to
the
state
court
proceedings,
and
i
think
that
in
order
to
do
that,
the
petitioner
has
a
higher
burden
properly
to
fulfill
than
the
mere
burden
that
he
has
to
gain
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
to
appeal
within
the
federal
system
something
that
involves
no
state
interest
at
all.
so,
although
it
may
be
inconsistent,
i
think
that
there
are
good
reasons
for
it.
i
also
think
that--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
to
look
and
see
what
happened
after
he
got
his
certificate
of
probable
cause.
we
know
from
this
court's
authorities,
garrison
and
the
other
cases,
that
what
he
has
to
have
is
a
fair
opportunity
to
present
his
claims,
and
he
has
to
have
notice
of
what
those
procedures
are,
and
in
this
case
he
had
the
opportunity
to
present
a
brief,
any
brief
that
he
wanted,
any
number
of
briefs
that
he
wanted
up
through
the
day
of
oral
argument.
he
had
unlimited
oral
argument
itself,
and
he
had
a
written
opinion.
now,
much
has
been
made
of
the
time
periods
the
petitioner
had
to
prepare
his
briefs
in
his
oral
argument.
in
fact,
these
are...
the
important
issue,
the
hypothetical
testimony
issue
is
one
that
he
had
briefed
five
separate
times
in
prior
judicial
proceedings,
both
state
and
federal,
which
had
been
going
on
since
his
original
appeal.
he
raised
it
in
his
original
appeal,
and
his
certiorari--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--the
fifth
circuit
never
went
so
far
as
to
call
the
issue
frivolous.
they
came
next
to
calling
it
frivolous,
and
i
am
submitting
to
you
that
what
i
believe
the
district
judge
meant
was
that
the
issue
is
not
frivolous.
that
is
what
i
have
to
decide.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
that's
correct.
they
did
not
use
the
word
"frivolous"
probably
because
they
didn't
want
to
get
into
the
inconsistency
of
saying
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
saying
that
the
matter
was
not
frivolous,
which
they
didn't
do.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
they
did
address
the
merits,
and
i
am
not
sure
about
your
use
of
the
word
"summary",
your
honor.
they
allowed
the
briefs,
any
briefs,
and
the
matters
that
were
briefed--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--it
was
the
normal
for
a
stay
proceeding,
which
are
common
and
routine
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
all
right,
sir.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
he
had
from
the
time
he
first
briefed
his...
the
hypothetical
question
issue,
he
had
a
number
of
years
to
prepare
that.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
your
honor--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--all
right.
he
was
sentenced
to
death
on...
he
was
sentenced--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--yes,
sir.
december
the
20th,
1982,
the
trial
court
sentenced
him
to
die
on
january
the
25th,
1982.
he
had
36
days
between
the
date
he
was
sentenced
to
die,
when
he
knew
that
he
would
die,
to
pursue
whatever
relief
that
he
needed
to
pursue,
36
days,
and
he
ultimately--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
that
was
the
original
one.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
he
was
resentenced
after
the
district
court
in
this
case--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
but
he
was
resentenced
to
die
on
december
the
20th,
after
the--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--yes,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
sir,
it
is.
his
execution
was
scheduled
on
december
the
20th,
1982,
36
days
hence,
and
so
at
that
point
he
knew
he
was
going
to
be
in
the
process
of
getting
a
stay
of
execution
from
the
state
or
the
federal
courts.
he
ultimately
presented
three
issues
in
the
fifth
circuit
to
support
the
granting
of
a
stay.
the
hypothetical
question
issue,
which
had
been
briefed
many
times
previously,
a
jurisdictional
issue
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
hold
frivolous,
purely
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
thirdly,
the
issue
of
the
allegedly
perjurious
witness,
mary
richards.
now,
she
surfaced
on,
apparently,
december
the
27th,
1982,
when
she
contacted
the
petitioner's
attorneys
and
they
took
her
deposition
in
austin,
texas,
when
the
state
was
not
present,
having
had
no
notice,
and
so
even
after
december
the
27th,
they
had
18
to
20
days
in
which
to
prepare
a
brief
raising
that
issue,
which
they
did.
indeed,
the
surfacing
of
mary
richards
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
have
argued
that
the
speeding
up
of
this
process
achieves
justice.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
she
wouldn't
have
come
forward
if
an
execution
date
had
not
been
set.
i
think
that
the
procedure--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
sir.
i
don't
think--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--because
they
said
they
did.
because
they
said--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
i
suppose
besides
the
possibility
that
some
other
court
might
stay
the
execution
and
things
might
be
left,
the
inquiry
they
were
making
was
not
whether
he
was
right
or
wrong
in
any
of
the
assertions
he
was
making
on
the
merits.
the
inquiry
they
were
making
under
rule
8
as
they
followed
it
was
whether
or
not
they
entertained
a
reasonable--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--yes,
sir,
i
am
defending
what--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
they
gave
him
an
easier
burden.
they
said
to
the
petitioner,
you
don't
have
to
show
us
that
you
are
going
to
win
any
of
these
issues.
all
you
have
to
show
us
is
that
you--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--the
only
thing
i
know
that
would
be
wrong
is,
they
hadn't
been
doing
that
in
prior
cases,
and
under
garrison
and
this
court's
authorities
i
don't
know
if
the
petitioner
was
on
notice
that
he
was
going
to
be
actually
affirmed
on
all
his
positions.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
most
certainly,
and
that
he
would
have
to
show
a
substantial
issue.
not
that
he
would
prevail,
but
that
he
had
an
issue,
a
substantial
issue
that
could
cause--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--if
that
was
their
routine
policy,
i
think
they
could.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
sir,
it
wasn't.
what
their
routine
policy
was
to
do
was
to
decide
whether
he
raised
an
issue
that,
as
i
put
it
in
the
brief,
raised
a
reasonable
judicial
doubt
as
to
its
outcome.
that
is
all
that
he
had
to
do,
to
raise
a
question
in
the
minds
of
two
out
of
those
three
judges
that
if
he
had
an
appeal,
it
was
possible
that
he
might
win,
reasonable
to
think
that
he
might
win,
and
if
he
couldn't
do
that,
then
the
fifth
circuit,
by
denying
the
state
of
execution,
would
in
effect
be
saying,
what
is
the
use
of
going
ahead
with
the
full
appeal
and
more
briefing
and
our
usual
burdens
upon
whether
judgment
is
going
to
be
affirmed
or
reversed
when
the
result
is
preordained
by
the
finding
that
we
have
already
made
that
he
can't
even
present
an
issue
that
has
substantial
merit
or
semblance.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
i
am
suggesting
it
is
consistent
with
garrison,
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
your
honor--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
your
honor,
it
would
be
mooted
by
his
execution
if
barefoot--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--correct,
which
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
appeal
of
charlie
brooks.
that's
right.
and
if
the
fifth
circuit
had
adopted
those
procedures,
i
have
agreed
that
i
think
that
they
could
have
done
so
under
garrison
if
there
had
been
notice
to
the
parties
and
so
on,
but
what
they
did
here
was,
they
did
something
that
was
even
easier
for
the
petitioner.
they
said,
you
don't
have
to
convince
us
you
are
going
to
win.
all
you
have
to
convince
us
of
is
that
there
is
a
reasonable
doubt
or,
as
the
fifth
circuit
has
also
said,
that
we
don't
have
adequate
time
at
this
point
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
raise
a
substantial
issue.
and
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
o'bryan
that
if
they
didn't
have
adequate
time
again
they
would
grant
the
stay.
i
have
said
in
my
brief
that
i
don't
quarrel
with
that
approach
either.
i
think
perhaps
i
have
conceded
too
much.
the
problem
of
the--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
for
the
focus
in
these
proceedings
to
be
upon
the
trial,
the
direct
appeal,
and
the
first
certiorari
petition.
those
are
the--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
i
wish
that
they
had
been,
and
in
this
case,
the
trial
itself,
the
conviction
occurred
three
and
a
half
months
after
the
crime.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
then
it
was
on
appeal
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
for
17
months
before
a
result
was
obtained--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--yes,
sir.
well,
then
there
was
a
certiorari
petition
which
sat
in
this
court
for
14
months
before
being
ruled
upon,
and
then
he
was
in...
he
filed
the
state
habeas
corpus
writ
that
was
very
speedily
resolved,
denied
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
about
four
months
after
this
court
had
denied
certiorari.
then
he
was
in
federal
district
court,
where
it
took
13
months
following
an
evidentiary
hearing.
it
wouldn't
have
taken
so
long.
there
were
three
evidentiary
hearings
set
at
our
request,
upon
our
motion
to
expedite
proceedings
in
the
district
court,
but
the
judge
heard
extensive
evidence
in
that
federal
evidentiary
hearing.
he
had
to
write
extensive
findings
of
fact,
conclusions
of
law,
which
took
him
from
august
to
november,
basically,
to
write,
and
which
i
don't
think
was
an
unreasonable
delay,
and
i
think
it's
appropriate
at
this
point...
at
that
point
in
the
proceedings
to
say
that
if
the
petitioner,
after
all
of
this
review,
which
at
that
point
had
involved
nine
separate
proceedings,
51
judges,
state
and
federal,
not
one
of
whom
had
ever
found
any
constitutional
problem
with
what
happened
at
his
trial.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
fifty-one,
your
honor.
that
include
some
overlap,
but
there
still
would
be
at
least
40.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no...
well...
no,
sir,
there
was...
between
his
first
appeal
and
his
second
and
third
state
habeas
corpus
appeals,
there
was
a
large
turnover
on
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
there
is
some
overlap,
but
it
was
before
51
judges,
and
there
is
not
one
who
has
yet
to
find
a
constitutional
problem
with
this
trial.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
sir.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
and
at
this
point
there
had
been
a
federal
district
judge,
of
course.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
before
that,
twice,
now,
incidentally,
he
also
denied
an
additional
habeas
corpus
writ
on
march
28th
by
mr.
barefoot
based
upon
different
grounds.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
um-hm.
and
then
the
three...
and
then
the
three
judges
of
the
fifth
circuit
are
included
within
that
number.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
ordinary
litigation
is
subject
to
motions
to
stay
pending
appeal.
it
is
routine.
we
have
to
get
them
ourselves
when
we
lose
habeas
corpus
cases
in
the
state
of
texas,
and
there's
an
order
to
release
a
petitioner.
we
have
to
go
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
ask
for
a
motion
to
stay
that
in
order
to
keep
him
incarcerated
during
the
appeal.
it
is
not
extraordinary.
now,
it
may
appear
extraordinary
when
it
is
applied
to
a
capital
case,
but
again,
the
burden
that
is
placed
on
the
petitioner
is
the
same
as
any
litigant.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
your
honor,
the
fifth
circuit
has
to
allow
the
briefing
that
the
time
constraints
will
allow
in
terms
of
the
execution
and
then
if
there
hasn't
been
adequate
time
for
them
to
get
briefs
that
they
thought
were
satisfactory,
or
to
decide
the
issues
presented
by
the
briefs,
then
i
said
they
should
stop
the
execution,
they
should
stay
it.
they
should
refuse
to
stay
the
execution
only
where
they
are
satisfied
with
the
presentation
by
the
parties
and
where
they
are
satisfied
in
good
conscience
that
they
have
had
adequate
time
to
determine
that
there
is
not
substantial
issue.
otherwise,
they
are
free
to
stay
the
execution.
we
are
asking
for
a
limited
rule.
we
are
not
saying
petitioner
has
the
burden
of
proof
to
do
this,
and
if
he
doesn't
have
time
to
do
it,
then
he
loses.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
um-hm.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
and
then
we
will
be
fighting
for
a
stay
of
execution
or
opposing
a
stay
of
execution.
that's
right.
we
have
attempted
to
expedite
the
proceedings
also
in
the
district
courts,
and
have
been
very
successful,
and
did
so
in
this
very
case,
expedite
them
at
every
point,
to
reach
a
result
in
these
cases,
whether
the
state
wins
or
whether
the
state
loses.
we
want
to
reach
a
result.
we
want
the
people
off
death
row,
whether
they
weren't
supposed
to
be
there
in
the
first
place
or
whether
there
is
no
constitutional
problem
with
their
conviction,
and
that
they
should
be
executed,
and
when
we
are
in
the
context
of
a
motion
for
stay
in
the
fifth
circuit,
we
don't
think
it
is
inappropriate
to
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
refuse
to
grant
the
stay
of
execution
unless
the
petitioner
can
show
a
substantial
issue.
that
is
all
that
we
have
asked
for
in
this
case.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
if
they
didn't
have
time
to
decide
the
question,
which
is
what
they
said
in
the
o'bryan
case,
then
they
grant
the
stay
of
execution,
and
what
would
happen
is,
then
they
went
ahead
with
the
normal
briefing
schedule.
now,
once
they
had
stayed
the
execution,
there
wasn't
anything
else
that
could
be
done,
because
the
state
of
texas
couldn't
set
a
new
execution
ordinarily.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
your
honor--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--rule
8
is
probably
burdensome
to
the...
more
burdensome
to
the
court
of
appeals
than
life
would
be
without
it,
because
in
those
cases,
too,
they
have
to
do
the
same
thing.
they
have
to
decide,
do
we
stop
everything
on
appeal,
and
if
we
don't,
sometimes
that
makes
things
easier
for
them.
an
appeal
can
be
mooted
out
by
refusing
to
stay
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
and
subject
it
to
dismissal
later
on,
as
certainly
happened,
and
has
happened
to
me.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
your
honors,
i
have
attempted
to
reduce
my
argument
upon
the
stay
question
to
a
syllogism.
first,
that
it
is
perfectly
understandable
why
the
standards
for
granting
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
a
stay
pending
appeal
are
different.
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
to
the
appeal
involves
an
internal
matter
of
federal
jurisdiction
with
no
particular
concern
for
the
state.
the
granting
of
a
stay
pending
an
appeal
involves
in
effect
an
injunction
against
the
state
court
proceedings
and,
we
argue,
justifies
the
higher
standard
that
has
been
required
in
these
cases.
the
standard
for
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
is
an
absence
of
frivolity
of
at
least
one
issue,
and
of
the
stay,
that
there
be
a
substantial
question.
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
illustrates
the
district
court's
painstaking
attempt
to
distinguish
between
those
issues
that
were
frivolous,
some
of
which
were
labeled
as
frivolous
in
his
opinion,
and
others,
like
the
psychiatric
issue,
at
page
12
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
the
district
court
stated
that
upon
careful
reflection,
this
ground
is
without
merit,
and
i
think
the
district
court
felt
that
if
he
had
to
give
the
kind
of
careful
reflection
to
an
issue
that
he
had
to
give
in
this
opinion,
that
it
was
not
frivolous,
but
at
the
same
time
that
he
could
in
good
faith
conclude
that
it
was
not
substantial,
and
therefore
grant
the
state's
motion
to
reinstitute
the
execution.
secondly,
the
fifth
circuit
could
have
simply
expedited
the
appeal
and
done
essentially
the
same
things
that
it
did
do
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
instead,
it
did
something
that
was
more
favorable
to
the
petitioner.
clearly,
the
fifth
circuit
addressed
the
merits
of
all
the
issues
that
petitioner
raised
in
this
case.
they
did
so
in
applying
the
stay
standard
to
determine
whether
any
of
those
were
substantial,
a
more
favorable
standard
for
petitioner
to
prevail
upon
than
he
would
have
had
in
an
expedited
appeal.
so,
although
i
think
they
could
have
expedited
the
appeal
and
actually
affirmed
the
judgment,
i
also
think
if
they
could
have
done
that,
plainly
they
could
have
done
something
that
was
more
favorable
to
petitioner,
which
is
to
consider
his
issues
within
the
context
of
a
stay.
the
procedures
are
not
precisely
a
way
to
expedite
all
capital
cases,
as
was
suggested.
it
is
a
manner,
and
there
have
been
indeed
many
cases
where
we
did
not
oppose
stays
of
execution
that
were
granted
by
district
courts,
even
though
we
were
plainly
entitled
to
do
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
rule
8.
instead,
what
it
is
is
a
means
of
deciding
where
an
injunction
is
necessary
in
a
capital
case
as
in
any
other
kind
of
case,
to
preserve
the
appellant's
right
to
appeal,
to
make
a
preliminary
evaluation
of
the
issues
that
are
presented,
to
determine
whether
any
of
them
are
substantial,
and
to
determine
whether
further
delays
are
appropriate
even
though
there
are
no
substantial
issues.
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case
is
to
decide
that
where
there
was
no
substantial
issue
after
a
careful
examination
of
the
merits,
no
further
delay
was
appropriate.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
an
unreasonable
burden
on
the
courts
of
appeals.
it
is
one
that
they
exercise
all
the
time.
i
don't
think
the
fifth
circuits
thinks
it
is
an
unreasonable
burden.
the
fifth
circuit,
it
must
be
remembered,
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
absolute
right
simply
to
grant
the
stay
of
execution
pending
appeal.
they
would
have
had
to
write
nothing
upon
that
point,
and
the
state
would
have
been
out
of
court.
instead,
what
they
did
was
to
take
on
that
burden
and
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
any
of
the
issues
were
substantial.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
the
hypothetical
psychiatric
testimony,
i
think
that
what
the
plaintiff
does
ask
the
court
in
effect
to
do
is
to
overrule
jurek,
something
that
is
obviously
not
before
the
court,
and
that
is
the
import
of
his
argument,
because
in
jurek
if
the
court
approved
the
future
dangerousness
issue
as
an
appropriate
one
to
decide
the
question
of
life
or
death,
the
court
also
in
the
same
breath
said
that
all
relevant
evidence
should
be
presented.
i
think
that
petitioner's
argument
that
there
is
no
room
for
mitigating
circumstances
within
this
context
is
plainly
without
merit.
the
very
criteria
that
drs.
holbrook
and
grigson
enumerated
as
important
to
their
diagnosis
emphasized
the
kinds
of
things
that
petitioner
says
he
had
no
opportunity
to
present,
things
like
family
ties,
and
employment
record,
attendance
at
church,
a
stable
circle
of
friends,
and
all
the
other
things
in
his
brief
that
he
says
could
not
have
affected
the
opinion
of
the
psychiatrists
are
the
very
things
that
are
directly
related
to
the
loyalty
to
institutions
that
the
doctors
talked
aboutduring
their
testimony.
he
could
have
impeached
their
testimony
upon
that
basis
and
asked
them
if
it
would
have
been
changed
if
any
of
those
things
existed.
he
could
have
clearly
put
on
evidence,
mitigating
evidence
of
those
facts
at
the
punishment
phase
in
order
to
argue
that
to
the
jury,
and
he
did
not.
it
can
only
be
assumed
that
those
things
did
not
exist.
i
also
will
emphasize
that
under
texas
law,
the
defendant
can,
and
he
does,
call
psychiatric
witnesses
in
his
own
behalf,
and
although
the
assertion
has
been
made--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
your
honor,
not
exactly,
no.
there
are
several
states
that
include
future
dangerousness
as
an
important
factor.
in
virginia--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--five
that
i
know
of.
of
the
33--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
out
of
the
33
that
have
the
death
penalty,
or
all
50,
yes,
sir.
virginia's
scheme
is--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
there
are
a
wide
variety
of
psychiatrists
who
testify
in
texas
as
a
matter
of--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
now,
it
is
up
to
the
individual
district
attorneys
as
to
who
they
want
to
use.
both
dr.
grigson
and
dr.
holbrook
testified
at
trial
that
they
had
testified
for
defendants
before.
that
is
in
the
record.
dr.
grigson
has
testified
against
me
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
and
so
i
don't
think
the
situation
is
as
black
and
white
as
petitioner
and
some
of
the
amici
would
lead
you
to
believe.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
sir.
he
has...
there
is
no
denying
that
he
has
testified
in
a
wide
range
of
cases.
there
is
also
no
denying
that
that
would
be
a
substantial
basis
for
his
impeachment
by
the
defendant,
and
in
fact
that
was
used
as
a
basis
for
his
impeachment.
during
jury
argument,
i
think
it
is
worth
noting...
i
think
reading
the
jury
argument
in
this
case
at
the
punishment
phase
is
well
worth
the
court's
time,
because
it
places
this
issue
within
the
proper
context.
you
will
see
defense
counsel
arguing
to
the
jury
without
objection
that
psychiatrists
cannot
predict
human
behavior
with
certainty,
citing
literature,
the
studies,
the
apa
task
force
report.
they
can't
predict
future
dangerousness.
they
had
never
examined
defendants.
that
their
elements
of
the
diagnosis
didn't
prove
it.
that
all
sociopaths
do
not
necessarily
commit
acts
of
future
violence.
that
the
facts
in
the
hypothetical
question
were
not
true
and
therefore
should
not
be
believed
by
the
jury,
and
a
number
of
other
matters.
they
also
emphasized
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
hypothetical
question
about--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
your
honor,
but
he
could--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
he
could
have
presented
evidence
of
his
own
to
further
substantiate
his
claim.
in
fact,
i
don't
know
of
anything
that
is
any
of
the
briefs
of
the
petitioner
or
of
the
amici
that
could
not
have
been
presented
at
trial,
either
in
the
way
of
evidence
or
in
the
way
of
jury
argument.
the
jury
was
charged
by
the
court
that
expert
witnesses
are
the
same
as
any
other
witnesses
in
the
sense
that
their
testimony
is
to
be
weighed
by
the
jury,
and
the
jury
is
to
give
whatever
credibility
that
they
wish
to
those
witnesses.
and
the
district
attorney
in
this
case,
in
his
own
summation,
told
the
jury
to
weigh
the
testimony
of
the
expert
witnesses,
and
that
they
may
want
to
put
a
certain
amount
of
credence
here,
or
a
certain
amount
there,
and
furthermore,
he
told
the
jury
that
if
any
way
the
facts
and
the
hypothetical
question
were
inaccurate,
that
they
should
not...
that
they
should
discount
the
answer
to
the
hypothetical
question
also.
i
think
that
there
was
ample
ground
for
the
defense
to
present
mitigation
within
the
context
of
the
hypothetical
question,
and
that
as
long
as
that
opportunity
existed,
they
should
not
be
heard
to
complain
now.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
sir.
