justice
john
paul
stevens
wait
a
minute.
excuse
me.
may
i
interrupt?
you
said
the
death
sentence
was...
i
thought
the
death
sentence
was
on
november
21st,
1978.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
he...
and
he
was
in
the
state
system
for
about
three
years
before
he
even
started
the
federal
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
not
the
death
sentence,
that
is
just
a
scheduling
of
the
execution,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
the
death
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
quite
a
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
at
this
point
about
the
timing
of
the
thing?
because
we
are
all
interested
in
expeditious
procedures
in
these
cases.
the
case
was
in
the
state
court
system
for
about
three
years.
it
was
in
the
federal
district
court
for
several
months,
maybe
close
to
a
year.
and
then
you
get
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
suddenly
there
is
a
great
emergency.
why,
if
there
is
this
much
time
allowed
for
the
texas
appellate
courts
to
review
it
carefully,
why
should
there
suddenly
be
this
change
in
emphasis
on
accelerated
procedures
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
couldn't
they
be
done
more
rapidly
than
three
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
compares
with
what
period
of
time
in
the
federal
appellate
system?
justice
john
paul
stevens
apart
from
the
cert
petition,
which
of
course
would
be
nine
of
the
judges
here--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
was
only
one
federal
judge
at
that
point,
wasn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
your
submission,
just
so
i
get
it,
that
once
the
case
reached
the
federal
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
time,
then
everything
should
accelerated
at
a
radically
different
rate
than
ordinary
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
i
am
really
trying
to
get
your
position
as
a
general
matter,
not
just
this
case.
is
it
your
view
that
when
a
capital
case
first
reaches
the
federal
court
of
appeals
on
the
first
review
of
a
denial
of
an
application
for
habeas
corpus,
there
should
be
an
expedited
procedure
in
that
court
in
every
capital
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
so,
how
much...
what
should
it
be,
ten-day
briefing,
or
what
is
the
regular
procedure
they
ought
to
follow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
are
asking...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
you.
you
are
asking
that
as
soon
as
the
first
federal
habeas
corpus
application
is
denied,
you
then
will
run
into...
proceed,
i
shouldn't
say
run,
you
will
go
promptly
into
the
state
court
and
get
an
execution
date
set--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
will
then
accelerate
the
proceedings
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
would
be
your
view
that
if
he
did
show
a
substantial
issue
and
they
weren't
quite
prepared
to
decide
it,
they
should
then
have
a
second
argument.
you
are
in
effect
asking
for
two
arguments
on
the
merits,
i
mean,
in
a
case
that
is
close
enough
that
it
requires
some
thought.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a...
maybe
this
shouldn't
be
a
consideration,
but
the
procedure
you
advocate
will
be
more
burdensome
for
the
federal
courts
of
appeals,
because
they
will
have
to
take
the
first
look
at
it
on
an
expedited
basis,
and
if
they
think
there
is
a
serious
question,
then
they
set
it
down
for
a
second
briefing
and
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
routine
you
ask
for.
