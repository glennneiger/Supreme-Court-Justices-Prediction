well,
what
if
the
only
difference
is
between
the
x

the
non-x
is
that
there
is
a
different
man
making
a
judgment
of
the

is
that...
can
an
agency
act
by
saying,
we
just
changed
our
mind
about
what
the
facts
are
and
the
reason
we've
changed
our
mind
is
they
are
different
minds?
justice
byron

white
these
cases
are
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
in
1966,
congress
passed
the
national
traffic
and
highway
safety
act
which
among
other
things
required
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
formulate
an
issue,
highway
safety
standards.
the
secretary
delegated
his
authority
to
the
national
highway
traffic
safety
administration.
that
agency,
among
other
things,
issued
safety
standard
208
which
at
that
time
simply
required
that
new
cars
have
seat
belts.
over
a
period
of
time
however,
and
after
much
pulling
and
hauling,
the
agency
issued
a
modified
standard
208.
that
standard
among
other
things
required
that
after
certain
date,
new
cars
would
be
equipped
either
with
airbags
or
with
automatic
seatbelts.
these
were
the
so-called
passive
restraints
and
that
they
--
and
they
are
used,
didn't
require
–
didn’t
depend
on
the
volition
of
the
driver
or
the
other
occupant
of
the
car.
that
standard
to
say
the
least
was
controversial.
there
were
many
developments
and
eventually
the
agency
revoked
or
rescinded
modified
standard
208
insofar
as
it
required
any
passive
restraint.
after
that,
the
aim
of
the
decision
was
to
eliminate
the
requirement
for
either
airbags
or
automatic
seatbelts.
the
decision
was
challenged
in
the
court
of
appeals
successfully,
the
court
of
appeals
holding
and
that
their
rescission
was
arbitrary
capricious.
the
motor
vehicle
manufacturers
association
and
others
brought
the
cases
here
and
we
granted
certiorari.
although
our
approach
to
the
case
is
somewhat
different
from
court
of
appeals,
we
also
hold
the
rescission
to
have
been
arbitrary
and
--
and
capricious.
agencies
are
required
to
give
reasons
for
their
action
and
to
explain
the
basis
for
their
decisions.
that
standard
was
not
satisfied
here.
the
entire
focus
of
the
rescission
action
was
on
automatic
seatbelts.
no
attention
was
given
to
--
or
no
explanation
was
given
as
to
why
the
airbag
requirement
was
rescinded
along
with
the
automatic
seatbelt
requirement
and
that
the
agency
must
explain.
we
also
have
concluded
for
reasons,
we've
given
an
opinion
that
the
explanation
for
rescinding
the
automatic
seatbelt
requirement
was
also
inadequate
in
certain
respects.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated.
the
cases
are
returned
to
that
court
so
that
they
may
be
returned
to
the
agency
for
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
the
opinion
is
unanimous
except
for
parts
5
(b)
and
part
6.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
in
dissenting
and
part
in
which
he
explains
why
he,
the
chief
justice,
and
justices
powell
and
o'connor
do
not
join
those
two
parts
of
the
opinion.
