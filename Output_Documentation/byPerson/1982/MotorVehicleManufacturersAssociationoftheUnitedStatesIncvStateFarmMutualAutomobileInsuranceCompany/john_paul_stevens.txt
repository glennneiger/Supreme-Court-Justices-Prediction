mr.
lee,
may
i
ask
you
one
question.
is
it
your
view
that
the
standard
to
be
applied
in
deciding
whether
a
rescission
was
proper
is
the
same
as
the
standard
to
be
applied
in
whether
or
not
to
adopt
a
regulation
in
the
first
instance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
about
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
really
what
i'm
asking
you
is,
do
you
think
the
secretary
has
the
same
latitude
in
rescinding,
just
the
same
broad...
in
rescinding
this
regulation,
as
he
would
have
had
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
put
it
into
effect
in
the
first
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
he
in
promulgating
a
regulation
have
an
obligation
to
take
into
account--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--then
you
really
are
saying
it's
the
same
standard,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
he
had
to
make
any
findings
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
he
had
to
make
any
findings
at
all?
what
if
he'd
done
what
he
did
in
february.
would
that
have
been
lawful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but--
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fitzpatrick,
you
said
that
they
found
that
the
new
belt
would
not
work.
i
don't
think
that's
right.
they
found
if
it's
detached
it
would
not
work.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
really
didn't
make
a
finding
on
how
often
it
would
be
detached.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
by
the
record
or
by
what's
happened
since
the
rescission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
happened
since
the
rescission?
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
describing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
let
me
interrupt
you
about
the
belt
that
didn't
work.
isn't
that
on
the
assumption
that
the
belt
will
be
detached
just
as
often
as
an
active
belt
will
not
be
hooked
up
in
the
first
instance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
did
the
agency
even
consider
the
extent
to
which
the
belt
would
be
detached
as
compared
with
the
extent
to
which
people
will
hook
up
the
belt
in
the
first
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
find
it
in
their
report.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
isn't
it
perfectly
clear
that
there
will
be
greater
seat
belt
usage
if
the
belt
is
automatically
attached
and
you
have
to
do
something
affirmative
to
detach
it,
as
opposed
to
the
active
belt?
isn't
that
perfectly
obvious?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
one
of
them?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
just
get
one
percent
increase,
you
save
over
100
lives
a
year.
