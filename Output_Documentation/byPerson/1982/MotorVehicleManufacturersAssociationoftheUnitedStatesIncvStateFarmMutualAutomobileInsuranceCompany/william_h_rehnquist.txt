justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
the
safety
and
utility
of
the
passive
belts
that
you
were
describing
a
moment
ago
bear
on
the
secretary's
decision
to
rescind
the
order
about
air
bags?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
really
just
arguing
with
the
facts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
certainly
not
going
to
decide
in
this
court
which
of
three
various
systems
of
passive
restraints
would
or
wouldn't
work.
that's
up
to
the
secretary.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
say
there
has
to
be
support
for
a
decision
to
promulgate
in
the
first
instance.
now,
supposing
this
agency,
which
is
charged
with
doing
something
about
auto
safety,
simply
promulgates
some
regulations
saying
you're
going
to
use
passive
seat
belts.
do
you
think
the
burden
is
on
the
agency
to
justify
the
promulgation
of
those
regulations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
asking
you.
do
you
think
the
burden
is
on
the
agency
to
justify
those
regulations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
some
support
in
the
record.
what
if
the
rescission
is
promulgated
by
notice
and
comment,
so
that
there
isn't
necessarily
any
factual
record
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
record
do
you
mean?
