mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
national
traffic
and
motor
vehicle
safety
act
of
1966
directs
the
secretary
of
transportation
to
issue
appropriate
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standards
which
shall
be
practicable,
shall
meet
the
need
for
safety,
and
shall
be
stated
in
objective
terms.
over
the
17
years
since
that
statute
was
enacted,
a
succession
of
transportation
secretaries
have
tried
to
find
the
best
way
to
implement
its
broad
authority.
the
optimum
solution
to
the
problem
of
occupant
crash
protection
has
been
particularly
elusive.
since
1967
standard
208,
which
deals
with
the
problem
of
occupant
crash
protection,
has
required
the
installation
of
manual
seatbelts.
passive
restraints,
which
require
no
independent
occupant
action
for
their
effectiveness,
were
first
incorporated
into
standard
208
in
a
series
of
amendments
adopted
between
1970
and
1972.
one
of
the
permitted
options
under
those
amendments
was
a
manual
belt
system
coupled
with
an
ignition
interlock.
however,
public
irritation
with
interlock
systems
led
congress
in
1974
to
prohibit
them
by
statute.
in
1976
secretary
coleman
attempted
to
deal
with
what
he
considered
to
be
the
root
of
the
problem:
widespread
public
resistance
to
mandatory
passive
restraints.
he
proposed
a
demonstration
project
involving
up
to
500,000
cars
installed
with
passive
restraints
in
order
to
smooth
the
way
for
their
public
acceptance
at
a
later
date.
secretary
coleman
did
not
reject
mandatory
passive
restraints
as
a
long-range
solution.
he
simply
concluded
that
they
would
be
more
effective
if
preceded
in
time
by
an
effort
to
change
the
public's
attitude
about
them.
his
successor
disagreed,
as
was,
in
our
view,
his
prerogative.
within
a
manner
of
months,
secretary
adams
dispensed
with
the
coleman
demonstration
project
and
instead
adopted
the
modified
standard
208
at
issue
here,
which
made
passive
restraints
mandatory
for
large
cars
beginning
with
the
1982
model
year
and
all
cars
beginning
with
the
1984
model
year.
while
it
permitted
manufacturers
to
choose
between
two
basic
systems,
air
bags
or
passive
belts,
it
was
assumed
at
that
time
that
about
60
percent
of
the
cars
would
be
equipped
with
air
bags.
four
years
after
the
adams
decision,
secretary
lewis
rescinded
the
mandatory
passive
restraint
features
of
standard
208.
he
based
his
decisions
on
three
findings:
first,
that
because
of
the
intervening
to
small
cars,
not
one
percent...
not
60
percent,
but
only
one
percent
of
all
cars
would
be
equipped
with
air
bags;--
second,
that
in
complying
then
with
standard
208
as
it
then
stood,
the
seat
belts
that
would
be
installed
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
new
cars
would
be
detachable,
and
that
once
detached
would
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
manual
belts;--
and
third,
that
there
was
substantial
uncertainty
about
the
usage
rate
of
these
detachable
belts
convertible
to
manual
belts.
under
those
circumstances,
nhtsa
could
not
reliably
predict
whether
increased
use
because
of
detachable
belts
would
fall
closer
to
zero
percent
or
closer
to
five
percent
or
ten
percent,
and
for
those
reasons,
together
with
the
possible
adverse
safety
effects
from
public
reaction
to
what
the
public
might
perceive
to
be
another
expensive
example
of
ineffective
regulation,
the
agency
could
not
conclude
that
the
automatic
restraints
as
then
stated
met
the
need
for
safety.
the
court
of
appeals
took
no
issue
with
the
first
two
of
these
findings.
it
described
them
as
reasonable.
but
it
said
that
the
third
step
turned
the
question
on
its
head.
the
court
conceded
the
factual
issue
of
probable
seat
belt
usage
was
one
which
no
one
could
predict
with
certainty.
nevertheless,
it
held
that
once
the
agency
had
selected
the
passive
restraint
course
of
action
in
1977,
the
presumption
no
longer
ran
in
favor
of
the
agency
judgment,
but
rather
in
favor
of
the
very
regulation
which
the
agency
had
concluded
did
not
meet
the
statutory
objectives.
the
effect
of
this
unprecedented
holding
is
truly
starting.
it
effectively
deprives
an
administrative
agency
of
its
authority
to
regulate
in
conditions
of
uncertainty
by
making
predictive
judgments
to
resolve
that
uncertainty,
judgments
which
in
many
cases,
including
this
one,
lie
at
the
very
heart
of
the
administrative
process.
by
definition,
where
predictive
judgments
must
be
made
in
uncertain
conditions,
as
they
must
here,
the
location
of
the
burden
will
usually
be
determinative.
this
case
illustrates
the
mischief
of
shifting
that
burden
once
the
agency
proposes
a
regulation,
and
here
is
the
reason
why.
there
are
several
views
concerning
which
path
leads
to
the
best
occupant
restraint
system.
over
the
17
years
that
secretaries
of
transportation
have
struggled
with
that
problem,
there
have
been
two
major,
enduring,
and
overarching
issues.
the
first
is,
how
effective
will
the
passive
restraint
system
really
be.
secretary
adams
in
1977
concluded
that
60
percent
of
all
cars
would
be
equipped
with
air
bags
under
his
proposal
and
that
this
would
be
highly
effective.
by
1981
the
circumstances
had
changed
dramatically.
it
was
clear
that
compliance
would
consist
of
easily
detachable
belts,
and
secretary
lewis
concluded
that
under
those
new
circumstance
the
requirements
created
by
standard
208
as
it
then
stood
would
not
be
effective.
there
has
always
been
a
second
broad
issue,
separate
and
very
important.
and
it
is:
assuming
that
there
is
to
be
a
passive
restraint
requirement
at
some
point
in
time,
which
of
two
possible
approaches
should
the
agency
emphasize
first
in
time?
do
you
push
ahead
first
with
hardware
requirements
or
do
you
emphasize
first
changes
in
public
attitude?
the
right
answers
to
those
two
controlling
questions
depend
on
the
resolution
of
multiple
uncertainties,
technological
uncertainties
and
behavioral
uncertainties.
someone
has
to
perform
the
necessary
task
of
sorting
out
those
uncertainties,
balancing
the
relevant
considerations
on
all
sides,
and
then
making
a
judgment
concerning
which
alternatives
ought
to
be
pursued
and
in
what
order.
it
is
equally
clear,
i
submit,
that
that
job,
making
predictive
judgments
in
conditions
of
uncertainty,
belongs
to
the
administrative
agency.
standard
208
has
been
in
existence
since
1967.
it's
been
amended
many
times.
after
more
than
a
decade
of
evolving
experimental
administrative
efforts
and
continuing
efforts
by
the
courts
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
also
for
the
district
of
columbia,
there
is
nothing
in
law
and
nothing
in
common
sense
that
suggests
that
that
evolution
should
be
frozen
as
of
the
1977
amendment.
in
1976
secretary
coleman
concluded
that
the
best
way
to
implement
the
statute
was
to
attempt
first
to
change
human
attitudes.
was
he
right?
was
that
the
best
solution?
reasonable
persons
will
differ.
but
what
ought
to
be
clear
to
everyone,
i
submit,
is
that
the
coleman
choice
of
alternative
did
not
preclude
secretary
adams
from
choosing
another
alternative
without
first
bearing
the
probably
impossible
burden
of
disproving
the
predictive
assumptions
underlying
the
coleman
decision.
and
for
the
same
reason,
in
1981
secretary
lewis
did
not
rule
out
the
possibility
of
passive
restraints
as
a
long-range
solution.
all
options
are
still
available.
all
options
are
still
open.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
my
answer,
justice
stevens,
is
yes,
they're
very
close,
but
i
need
to
modify
it
in
this
one
way.
the
standard
is
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness,
is
it
arbitrary
and
capricious.
and
as
i
read
the
cases
that
have
been
handed
down
from
this
court,
it
requires
that
the
agency
take
into
account
and
make
its
predictive
judgments
concerning
all
the
information
it
has
before
it.
now,
in
the
course
of
having
explored
one
path,
there
will
be
some
information
that
the
agency
has
to
take
into
account,
and
it
must
take
that
into
account.
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
two
things:
number
one,
it's
still
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
it's
a
question
of
whether
they've
acted
irrationally,
and
the
presumption
still
runs
in
favor
of
the
propriety
of
agency
action.
and
second,
in
the
great
majority
of
instances,
and
certainly
i
would
say
in
this
one,
the
standard
will
be
about
the
same
for
not
adopting
a
regulation
in
the
first
place
or
rescinding
one.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it's
always
governed
by
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
except
that
if
in
the
process
of
enacting...
of
considering
the
regulation
in
the
first
place
he
has
information
that
has
come
before
him,
he
does
have
the
obligation
to
take
that
information
into
account.
now,
if
it
had
been
presented
to
him
in
another
kind
of
context,
he
would
still,
of
course,
have
that
obligation
to
take
that
into
account.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
anything
that
comes
before
him,
of
course.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
in
the
overwhelming
majority
and
maybe
always,
it
will
be
the
same
standard,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
would
certainly
still
have
defended
what
he
did.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
though
not
under
all
circumstances
will
i
defend
what
he
did.
but
it
would
have
made
my
case
perhaps
more
difficult,
but
i
think
you
would
still
look
to
see
whether
an
objective
secretary
of
transportation,
acting
under
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
that
were
then
before
him,
acted
arbitrary
and
capriciously.
and
i
would
say,
yes,
that
while
we
would
have
a
less
adequate
explanation
as
too
why,
it
would
still
be
not
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
would
have
to
say
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
an
earlier
phase
of
this
very
litigation
is
correct,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
in
the
pacific
legal
foundation
case,
the
question
was
did
secretary
adams
in
his
1977
decision
have
to
take
into
account
probable
public
reaction.
the
court
said
yes,
that
the
secretary
did
have
to
take
it
into
account.
the
secretary
had
said
it
was
not
important
to
take
it
into
account.
the
court
nevertheless
held
that
it
was
reasonable.
so
my
answer
to
that
is
no,
there
is
no
obligation
to
set
forth--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
think
that
there
is
no
obligation
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
needless
to
say,
it
is
a
good
procedure
and
it
helps
a
reviewing
court
and
facilitates,
maximizes,
the
likelihood
that
it
would
be
upheld
as
proper.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
requirement,
that
it
is
a
per
se
requirement
in
every
instance
under
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
answer
is
no.
the
answer
is
no,
and
the
reason
is
this.
the
court
of
appeals
holding
to
the
contrary
that
there
was
the
obligation
to
consider
these
other
alternatives...
and
incidentally,
the
details
of
those
alternatives
will
be
discussed
more
thoroughly
by
mr.
cutler...
rests
on
the
court
of
appeals'
assumption
that
passive
restraints
are
required
by
the
statute,
so
that
if
detachable
belts
wouldn't
do,
then
the
court
has...
then
the
agency
has
an
obligation
to
go
on
and
consider
some
other
form
of
passive
restraint.
in
fact,
it
is
clear
that
the
statute
has
never
required
passive
restraints.
the
only
source
in
law
which
ever
provided
for
passive
restraints
is
an
agency
regulation,
and
the
agency
has
statutory
authority
to
revoke
its
own
regulations.
the
only
congressional
mandate
is
to
enact
regulations
which
are
practical,
meet
the
need
for
safety,
and
are
stated
in
objective
terms.
and
that
leaves
a
very
broad
leeway
to
the
administrative
agency
as
to
the
kinds
of
standards
to
adopt
in
implementation
of
that
broad
standard,
and
that
includes
the
time
order
according
to
which
either
one
alternative
will
be
considered,
and
none
has
been
foreclosed
by
what
secretary
lewis
his
done.
now
let
me
make
one
final
point,
and
it
bears,
justice
o'connor,
on
this
emphasis
on
alternatives.
the
one
thing
that
that
emphasis
on
alternatives
that
is
made
both
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
also
the
respondents
bears
out
is
that
it
really
underscores
and
confirms
the
fact
that
the
situation
as
it
stood
in
1981
was
not
satisfactory,
and
that
the
secretary
was
quite
right
not
to
let
it
simply
drift.
the
telling
fact
is
that
by
1981
it
was
clear
that
the
1977
assumption
was
wrong,
standard
208
as
then
written
was
not
going
to
do
the
job,
and
under
those
circumstances
it
was
not
irrational
for
the
secretary
to
rescind,
and
that
is
all
that
he
did.
the
real
criticism
that
has
been
leveled
against
him
is
that
he
didn't
then
go
on
to
pursue
alternatives
x,
y
and
z.
in
fact,
no
alternative
has
been
foreclosed,
but
that
is
a
separate
issue
from
the
only
issue
before
the
court,
which
is
the
rescission
of
a
particular
form
of
passive
restraint
when
passive
restraints
are
not
mandated
by
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
itself
conceded
that
the
secretary
could
suspend
the
regulation,
though
he
could
not
rescind.
that
i
submit
is
a
labeling
distinction
without
a
substantive
difference.
regardless
of
the
label,
the
secretary
had
the
authority,
once
he
concluded
we
were
on
the
wrong
path,
not
to
continue
down
that
path.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
if
there's
anything
that
ought
to
be
clear
after
mr.
fitzpatrick's
argument,
it
is
that
we
are
dealing
in
an
area
of
uncertainty,
an
area
that
ought
to
be
left
to
the
particular
abilities
and
expertise
of
the
administrative
agency.
indeed,
i
am
now
uncertain,
not
only
as
to
what
is
the
best
long-range
solution,
over
which
17
years'
worth
of
transportation
secretaries
have
struggled;
i
am
also
uncertain
even
as
to
what
mr.
fitzpatrick's
position
is.
i
heard
on
the
one
hand
that
the
agency
whom
i
represent
had
found
that
automatic
belts
do
work,
because
of
the
fact
that
hundreds
of
thousands...
there
have
been
hundreds
of
thousands
of
automobiles
that
had
effective
passive
belts,
and
that
it
had
increased
usage
by
40
percent.
what
he
neglected
to
tell
you
was
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
those
automobiles
had
their
detachable
belts
guarded
by
ignition
interlocks.
the
surprising
thing
about
those
data
is
that
the
figure
was
not
much
higher
than
40
percent,
because
unless
the
devices
have
been
tampered
with
you
can't
even
start
your
automobile
unless
those
seat
belts
are
buckled.
we
were
then
told
that
what
the
agency
should
have
done
was
to
rule
out
a
belt
that
doesn't
work,
then
conceding
that
in
fact
this
was
a
belt
that
didn't
work.
but
that
in
fact
is
exactly
what
secretary
lewis
did,
and
that's
all
he
did,
was
to
rule
out
a
belt
that
didn't
work.
the
standard
that
we
urge
in
this
case
that
should
be
adopted
is
whether
the
secretary
could
rationally
conclude
that
there
was
sufficient
uncertainty
to
justify
his
not
going
forward
with
the
procedure
that
wouldn't
work.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
considered--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
considered
it
to
this
extent,
justice
stevens.
it
came
up
to
the
point
that
it
found
that
there
were
no
reliable
data
that
indicated
one
way
or
the
other,
so
that
it
was
left
with
the
circumstance
exactly
as
secretary
coleman
had,
that
you
have
to
make
your
best
judgment.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
are
two
things
that
are
perfectly
obvious.
one
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
one
of
them,
that
there
will
be
some
increase.
but
the
second
thing
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--if
you
get
one

you
may
or
may
not

you
may
or
may
not
save
lives
a
year,
because
you
also
have
to
take
into
account
the
additional
cost
and
the
impact
on
public
reaction
that
results
from
the
public
perception

ineffective
regulation

leads
to
a

this
matter
of
the
defeat
rate,
the
problem
of
the
individual
regarding
the
device
that
is
in
his
automobile
as
an
enemy
and
finding
some
way
to
defeat
it,
to
cut
it
out,
as
obviously
happened
with
these
vw
belts
and
as
obviously
happened
with
the

is
a
very
real

must
be
taken
into
account.

that,
once

is

did
give
its

in
which
there
were
no
reasons

were
given.
now,
justice
white
asked
the
question,
isn't
this
just
a
matter...
what
if
you
had
the
same
facts
but
a
different
reviewer
of
facts?
that's
exactly
what
you
had
with
secretary
coleman
and
secretary
adams.
we
submit
this
judgment
should
be
reversed.
