we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
motor
vehicles
manufacturing
association
against
state
farm
mutual
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cutler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--your
time
has
expired,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fitzpatrick.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
is
the
author
of
that
description?
where
does--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--excuse
me,
mr.
fitzpatrick.
was
there
any
comparative
study
made
of
the
diminution
of
such
accidents
by
the
55
mile
an
hour
speed
limit
and
a
comparison
made
with
the
seat
belts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
my
question
goes
to
whether
the
same
result
could
be
accomplished
or
a
similar
result
by
a
55
mile
an
hour
speed
limit
enforced.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
"clearly
not",
what
study?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
who
established
the
criteria
in
the
first
place
in
your
view?
where
does
the
criteria
come
from,
congress
or
the
agency
or
some
third
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
you're
on
that,
on
the
first
step
that
you've
just
mentioned,
is
that
any
more
than
saying
to
the
agency,
do
something?
did
congress
say
to
the
agency
any
more
than,
do
something
about
this
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
they
have
to
prove
they
have
made
a
mistake?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
if
an
agency
concludes
that
something
that
it
has
tried
out
and
finds
that
it
doesn't
work,
it
can't
simply
say,
this
hasn't
worked
and
we're
going
to
write
it
off
and
try
something
else?
do
they
have
to
give
reasons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
more
reason
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
you
find
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i've
just
given
you
his
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
mr.
adams
has
to
prove
why
mr.
coleman
was
wrong
before
he
can
change
the
program?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
