mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
cover
the
second
ground
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
to
set
aside
the
agency's
action.
before
doing
so,
i'd
like
to
supplement
the
solicitor
general's
response
to
justice
stevens
and
justice
o'connor
by
saying
that
if
there
was
any
obligation
on
the
agency
to
explain
its
conduct,
its
decision,
it
was
an
obligation
to
give
reasons.
those
reasons
did
not
have
to
be
facts.
they
could
just
as
well
be
statements
of
uncertainties
about
facts,
particularly
facts
that
went
to
the
agency's
own
predictive
judgment.
they
didn't
have
to
find
facts;
they
had
merely
to
conclude
that
they
faced
uncertainties
about
their
predictive
judgments,
in
order
to
rescind
the
standard.
as
to
the
issue
of
alternatives,
a
majority
of
the
court
ruled
that
the
passive
restraint
requirement
was
not
justified...
a
majority
of
the
court
ruled
that
even
if
the
passive
restraint
requirement
was
not
justified
as
written,
the
agency
should
have
considered
other
alternative
versions
before
rescinding
this
one.
and
the
majority
discussed
three
such
alternatives:
one
was
requiring
that
if
passive
belts
were
used
to
comply
they
be
continuous
rather
than
detachable;--
second,
requiring
compliance
by
air
bags
only;--
and
third,
reviving
secretary
coleman's
voluntary
demonstration
program.
none
of
these
three
alternatives
was
listed
in
the
agency's
april
1981
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
that
ended
with
the
rescission.
that
notice
did
request
comments
on
a
number
of
alternative
actions,
but
those
did
not
include
the
ones
advanced
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
under
those
circumstances,
we
submit
it
would
have
been
improper
for
the
agency
to
adopt
any
of
the
different
proposals
later
advanced
by
the
court
of
appeals
before
issuing
a
further
notice
and
providing
opportunity
for
comment.
and
we
submit
further
that
the
court
should
not
have
reordered
the
agency's
own
priorities
so
as
to
require
it
to
consider
other
alternatives
before
rescinding
this
prospective
regulation
rather
than
after
doing
so,
as
the
agency
has
said
it
would
do.
and
even
if
it
would
be
appropriate
for
a
court
to
remand
in
some
circumstances
because
an
agency
had
failed
to
consider
other
alternatives,
we
would
submit
that
those
circumstances
do
not
exist
here.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
primarily
on
the
alternative
of
the
non-detachable
passive
belt,
sometimes
called
in
these
statements
in
briefs
the
continuous
passive
belt.
this
alternative,
though,
is
one
that
the
agency
did
consider
fully
in
the
decision
under
review,
and
its
reasons
for
rejecting
it
were
rational,
convincing
and
plainly
within
its
expert
discretion
in
applying
the
statutory
criteria.
these
reasons
were
the
safety
need
for
easy
emergency
egress,
the
public
fear
of
entrapment
by
attached
belts
in
a
crash,
and
public
and
congressional
resistance
to
use-compelling
features
in
passive
restraint
systems.
and
both
the
respondents
and,
we
submit,
the
court
of
appeals
were
wrong
to
suggest
that
the
non-detachable
belt,
so-called,
was
an
obvious
alternative
that
had
already
been
proven
acceptable
to
the
public
in
practice
and
had
clearly
increased
belt
usage.
until
1978
this
very
standard
required
that
if
a
passive
belt
system
were
used
the
belt
must
be
readily
detachable
by
the
passenger
to
permit
escape
in
an
emergency,
for
example
a
crash
in
which
the
door
anchoring
the
belt
mechanism
could
not
be
opened,
or
a
turnover.
in
'78
gm
obtained
agency
approval
to
experiment
with
continuous
spool-release
passive
shoulder
belts
and
they
equipped
the
1980
chevette
with
a
three-point
spool-release
belt
as
a
customer
option.
but
it
proved
unpopular
with
the
public,
despite
a
million
dollar
advertising
campaign.
only
13,000
were
sold
out
of
over
400,000
chevettes...
that
is
about
three
percent...
even
though
the
option
was
offered
for
most
of
the
time
without
charge
and
salesmen
were
offered
a
$25
bonus
if
they
could
persuade
a
customer
to
take
one.
moreover,
that
1980
chevette
belt
was
in
fact
detachable
to
simplify
emergency
egress,
and
if
you
look
at
the
drawing
of
the
belt,
which
is
at...
it's
gm's
drawing
at
page
2a
of
the
appendix
to
the
naii
brief...
it's
the
red
brief,
justice
stevens...
you
will
see
that
where
the
lap
portion
attaches
to
the
lower
door
there
is
a
detachable
push-button
buckle,
and
when
it's
detached
the
entire
three-point
belt
goes
slack.
the
shoulder
portion
stays
in
place
and
annoys
the
occupant,
but
the
system
as
a
whole
is
inoperable,
either
as
a
shoulder
belt
or
a
three-point
belt,
until
it's
reattached.
the
record
has
data
on
the
public
acceptability
and
usage
of
only
three
passive
belt
systems.
there's
this
1980
chevette
i
just
mentioned,
there's
the
'78
and
'79
chevettes,
and
the
vw
rabbits,
which
had
a
shoulder
belt
system
only,
protected
by
an
ignition
interlock,
and
as
the
solicitor
general
has
said,
public
annoyance
with
that
interlock
in
'74
had
driven
congress
to
forbid
the
agency
from
requiring...
from
issuing
any
standard
that
required
or
permitted
the
use
of
an
ignition
interlock.
so
that
option
was
just
not
available
to
the
agency.
even
though
ignition
interlocks
did
substantially
increase
belt
usage
even
for
active
belts
in
the
'74-'75
period
and
for
passive
belts,
it's
just
not
an
option
that
congress
has
permitted
the
agency
to
use.
in
addition,
it's
important
to
note,
as
the
agency
did,
that
there
is
an
important
self-selection
factor
that
explains
the
high
usage
rates
of
these
passive
belt
systems
guarded
by
interlocks
or
otherwise,
and
that
is
these
customers
voluntarily
chose
cars
with
passive
belt
systems
when
they
had
a
choice.
even
so,
a
substantial
number
of
those
customers
found
ways
to
disarm
the
belt
system
afterward,
and
in
the
case
of
the
chevette
1980
more
than
half
of
the
customers,
according
to
a
telephone
survey
cited
by
naii,
said
they
would
not
buy
that
same
system
again.
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
alternative
of
requiring
compliance
by
air
bags
only.
the
agency
has
repeatedly
found
that
a
substantial
part
of
the
driving
public
still
feels
uneasy
about
air
bags.
that
concern
was
reflected
in
the
1974
amendments,
where
congress
set
up
a
warning
flag
by
requiring
that
any
standard
requiring
the
use
of
an
air
bag
had
to
be
subjected
to
a
congressional
veto
procedure.
it
was
reflected
in
secretary
coleman's
'77
plan.
it
was
the
very
public
resistance
to
the
air
bag
that
led
him
to
defer
any
mandatory
passive
restraint
regulation
until
after
a
large-scale
voluntary
experiment
had
first
been
made.
and
finally
i
come
to
the
coleman
experiment.
the
essence
of
that
plan
was
voluntariness.
it
expressly
provided
that
the
plan
would
be
cancelled
if
the
agency
either
proposed
or
issued
a
passive
restraint
standard.
so
that
the
first
step,
if
anyone
was
even
to
think
of
reviving
the
coleman
plan,
would
be
to
rescind
this
present
regulation,
which
would
have
frustrated
any
coleman
plan
and
which
also
would
have
resulted
in
99
percent
of
the
cars
having
detachable
passive
belts
rather
than
air
bags.
and
the
agency,
when
it
did
do
just
that,
announced
that
it
plans
to
undertake
new
steps
to
promote
the
continued
development
and
production
of
air
bags.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
i'd
like
to
make
one
final
point.
the
respondents
claim
that
the
automobile
industry
has
not
done
its
part
to
improve
occupant
restraint
protection
and
the
usage
of
restraint
systems.
we
submit
the
record
before
you
is
to
the
contrary.
most
manufacturers
offered
active
seat
belts
before
the
safety
act
was
passed.
the
auto
companies
have
lobbied
vigorously
and
have
succeeded
in
obtaining
mandatory
child
restraint
usage
laws
in
33
states.
ford
and
gm
pioneered
in
developing
the
technology
of
the
air
bag.
and
well
before
the
coleman
experiment,
gm
voluntarily
committed
to
put
100,000
air
bag-equipped
cars
per
year
on
the
road
in
the
model
year
'74
to
'76--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--but
only
succeeded
in
selling
10,000.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
ignition
interlock
was
also
one
of
ford's
better
ideas.
