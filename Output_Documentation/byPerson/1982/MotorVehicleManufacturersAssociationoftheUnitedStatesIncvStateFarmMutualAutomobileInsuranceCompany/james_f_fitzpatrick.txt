mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
and
the
many
amici
here,
we
urge
that
the
action
of
dot
in
rescinding
the
passive
restraint
standard
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
was
properly
set
aside.
the
rule
we're
talking
about
here
today
has
been
described
as
the
most
important
safety
regulation
on
the
books.
certainly,
it
is
the
most
significant
effort
of
dot
to
respond
to
the
killing
and
maiming
on
our
nation's
highways.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
the
description
came
from
william
nordhaus,
who
was
a
witness
in
the
proceeding
below,
and
i
think
it
was
also
quoted
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
notwithstanding
the
profound
impact
on
highway
safety
of
the
regulation
at
issue
here,
at
bottom
the
case
itself
is
very
simple.
it's
a
conventional
case
of
apa
judicial
review
of
informal
rulemaking
under
the
traditional
standards
of
overton
park.
it
turns
on
the
auto
safety
act,
which
directs
dot
to
promulgate
standards
to
protect
the
motoring
public
against
unreasonable
risk
of
death
or
injury,
and
dot
did
promulgate
such
a
regulation
to
require
the
installation
of
passive
restraints
to
provide
protection
against
death
and
injury.
now,
in
anticipation
of
this
rule
two
types
of
passive
restraints
have
been
developed
and
installed,
and
it's
undisputed
on
this
record...
there's
no
uncertainty
here...
dot
agrees
that
these
two
technologies
work.
first
is
an
automatic
seat
belt
which
has
been
installed
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cars
since
1975,
and
those
belts
are
effective.
now,
this
is
not
buck
rogers
space
age
technology.
it
is
very
simple.
you
attach
the
seat
belt
to
the
door,
you
open
the
door,
you
slide
in,
you
close
the
door
and
the
belt's
in
place.
that's
all
that
it
is.
it
has
been
used
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cars
and
it
works.
now,
nhtsa's
own
studies
reflect
that
these
automatic
belts
in
use
have
increased
usage
by
over
40
percentage
points,
and
the
solicitor
general's
reply
on
pages
14
and
15
underscores
the
high
usage
rate
of
these
automatic
belts
that
have
been
in
place.
and
taking
account
of
any
demographic
differences...
selection,
small
cars,
particular
users...
taking
account
of
any
demographic
differences,
the
agency's
own
data
show
that
installation
of
those
seat
belts
would
save
almost
6,000
lives
a
year
and
avoid
over
100,000
injuries
each
year.
so
you
have
that--
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
--no,
i
don't
think
dot
has
done
that.
dot
has
had
no
question,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
ever
that
these
automatic
seat
belts
will
have
a
very
high
usage
rate
and
will
avoid
significant
numbers
of
deaths
and
injuries.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
clearly
not.
i
don't
think
there's
any
suggestion
on
this
record--
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
--i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
study
that
has
suggested
that.
but
there
has
never
been
any
argument
made
by
the
agency
itself
in
the
consideration
of
its
rulemaking
that
would
suggest
that
an
alternative
of
a
55
mile
an
hour
speed
limit,
as
useful
as
it
might
be,
would
be
a
response
to
the
problems
of
head-on
crashes.
a
head-on
crash
at
54
miles
an
hour
is
a
dreadful
event,
and
one
would
want
to
avoid
through
the
use
of
passive
restraints
the
death
and
injury
that
comes
from
crashes
at
20,
30,
40
and
50
miles
an
hour.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
yes.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
well,
the
secretary
decided
to
rescind
the
passive
restraint
standard
which
permitted
compliance
by
two
technologies:
either
the
automatic
belt,
which
has
been
found
to
have
high
usage
rates;
or
an
air
bag,
which
the
agency
itself
has
concluded
is
sound
and
effective.
so
what
the
secretary
is
doing
is
rejecting
technology,
both
air
bags
and
automatic
seat
belts,
that
work.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
i
think
that
goes
to
the
very
heard
of
what
was
at
issue
here.
you
had
two
technologies
that
work
and
at
the
last
moment
the
industry
advanced
a
third
type
of
technology
which
it
said
wasn't
going
to
work.
it
was
a
belt
that
had
a
release
right
at
one's
waist
and
there
were
slits
in
the
car
door.
you
could
easily
unbuckle
the
belt,
stow
it
permanently.
and
it's
on
that
basis
of
the
technology
that
didn't
work
that
the
secretary
rescinded
the
regulation.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
well,
that's
up
in
the
first
instance
to
the
secretary,
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
instance
looking
to
see
whether
there
was
appropriate
review.
but
it's
quite
true,
you
don't
have
to
decide
which
works.
you
take
the
agency
with
the
facts
as
they
found
them.
they
found
that
automatic
belts
do
work,
and
they
found
that
this
new
gm
belt,
this
fully
detachable
belt,
doesn't
work.
you
are
not,
of
course,
sitting
as
a
tryer
or
a
weigher
of
facts.
you
are
taking,
we
would
respectfully
suggest,
the
findings
as
the
agency
has
made
them
and
those
findings
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
the
secretary
has
rejected
this
standard
in
the
face
of
two
technologies
that
have
been
proven
effective,
simply
on
the
grounds
that
the
industry
has
come
forward
with
a
technology
that
has
been
designed
not
to
work
in
terms
of
its
safety
obligations.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
that's
correct.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
that
is
quite
correct.
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals...
and
one
should
be
precise
about
this...
the
second
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
once
detached
the
belt
is
functionally
identical
to
the
old
buckle-up
belt.
but
they
also
said,
once
attached
or
kept
attached,
it
has
the
same
characteristics
of
an
automatic
belt,
and
it
is
somewhat
shading
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
new
detachable
belt
was
functionally
identical.
they
said
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
here
that
indicates
what
the
usage
rates
are
going
to
be,
even
with
this
new
gm
belt.
but
our
point
is
at
this
juncture
in
the
argument
that
even
if
the
agency
was
right
that
this
gm
belt
was
in
fact
a
lemon
as
far
as
safety
is
concerned,
then
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
under
this
statute
to
rescind
the
regulation
rather
than
to
rule
out
a
belt
that
doesn't
work.
that,
your
honor,
we
believe
is
the
only
course
consistent
with
the
safety
act,
which
has
said
that
the
actions
of
dot
have
to
have
as
their
overriding
goal
the
promotion
of
safety.
and
you
have
beyond
that
the
clear
decision
of
the
congress
that
in
1966
the
control
over
the
pace
of
safety
progress
was
going
to
be
in
the
hands
of
dot
and
not
the
industry.
here,
by
permitting
the
industry
to
advance
a
technology
that
doesn't
work
you
are
shifting
back
to
the
industry
the
authority
to
control
the
pace
of
safety
development.
we
would
suggest
that
nothing
could
be
more
arbitrary
in
terms
of
the
goals
and
obligations
of
the
safety
act
than
to
permit
the
industry
itself
to
meter
the
pace
of
safety
progress.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
well,
congress
clearly
stated
an
obligation
that
dot
was
to
promulgate
regulations
which
would
lessen
the
unreasonable
risk
of
health
and
safety
to
american
motorists.
so
there
was
an
overarching
congressional
obligation.
the
agency
then
promulgated
a
statute...
it
promulgated
a
regulation--
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
--congress
imposed...
congress
did
not...
and
we
want
to
make
this
clear...
we
have
not
argued
that
congress
said
to
the
agency,
promulgate
this
passive
restraint
regulation.
what
congress
did
was
to
say,
promulgate
regulations
that
will
foster
the
safety
of
the
motorists
on
the
highway.
and
the
dot
did
that,
and
our
point
is
that
once
one
revokes,
once
one
faces
a
revocation
situation,
then
there
has
to
be
support
in
the
record
for
that
revocation
decision.
from
our
point
of
view--
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
--they
don't
have
to
prove
that
they
have
to
make
a
mistake.
however,
a
decision
to
revoke
and
a
decision
to
promulgate
are
both
based
upon
the
same
standard
under
the
apa,
and
there
has
to
be
some
support
for
their
decision
to
promulgate,
there
has
to
be
some
support
for
their
decision
to
revoke.
and
the
state
of
uncertainty
is
not
an
a
priori
state.
it
is
a
condition
that
is
based
upon
certain
factors
or
certain
determinations
of
certain
pieces
of
evidence
that
lead
up
to
the
decision,
the
conclusion
of
uncertainty.
well,
mr.
fitzpatrick--
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
indeed,
they
had
to
justify
it
twice,
in
two
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
no.
the
burden
of
proof...
let's
be
clear.
the
burden
of
proof
to
challenge
an
agency
action
is
on
the
side
of
the
party
that
is
making
the
challenge.
but
under
overton
park,
under
overton
park,
clearly
the
action
of
promulgation
and
likewise
the
action
of
revocation
is
action
that
cannot
be
without
any
record
support.
and
in
that
sense,
when
you
get
to
the
court
of
appeals
there
has
to
be
some
basis,
as
the
cases
in
this
court
have
made
absolutely
clear,
there
has
to
be
some
basis
for
the
agency
action
and
there
has
to
be
some
relationship
between
what
the
agency
found
and
what
the
agency
did.
so
clearly,
in
that
sense
the
agency
has
to
be
held
to
some
account
to
explain
or
justify
their
actions.
that's
what,
as
i
understood,
the
agency
is
all
about.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
there
is...
i
agree--
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
--in
this
sense.
this
is
not
a
fact-finding
proceeding
on
the
record.
however,
their
reasons
have
to
stand
up
to
scrutiny.
there
has
to
be
some
basis
in
the
record
or
in
logical
argument
that
supports
the
reasons.
and
here
there
wasn't
any
uncertainty
at
all
about
the
automatic
belts.
and
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
there
wasn't
any
support
for
their
conclusion
that
there
wouldn't
be
that
minimal
increase
in
even
this
gm
belt
to
meet
the
standard
of
the
statute
to
foster
safety.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
yes.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
yes,
they
do
indeed.
i
think
the
case--
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
--among
other
places,
you
find
it
in
the
atchison,
topeka
proceedings
in
this
court,
the
decisions
in
this
court.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
as
a
matter
of
administrative
law
that
if
an
agency
takes
you
down
this
road
and
says
this
road
is
justified
under
this
statute,
and
then
they
reverse
course
and
take
you
down
this
road,
the
cases
have
held
quite
clearly
that
there
is
some
burden
of
explaining
why
this
course
is
consistent
with
their
statutory
mandate.
now,
that
does
not
mean
that
an
agency
cannot
reverse
course.
of
course,
indeed,
if
an
agency
is
uncertain
and
there
is
support
for
that
uncertainty
in
the
record,
of
course
they
can
reverse
course.
but
they
simply
cannot
conclusively
say,
we
are
uncertain,
and
scrap
a
regulation.
that
action
of
revocation,
like
any
other
action
under
the
apa,
requires
some
record
support--
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
--we're
not
suggesting
there
has
to
be
a
trial
type
record.
we
are
looking
at
the
record
as
we
found
it
here.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
well,
the
record
of
the
informal
rulemaking.
there
were
comments
that
were
filed
with
the
parties
and
there
were
analyses
by
the
agency
and
there
was
an
opinion
written
by
the
agency.
and
in
all...
in
the
opinion
of
the
agency,
there
was
not
a
question
about
the
efficacy
of
the
automatic
seat
belt
and
the
air
bag.
so
those
are
the
facts
that
one
is
dealing
with
in
making
a
judgment
as
to
whether
this
recission
is
justified
or
whether
it
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
under
the
apa.
what
if
the
administrator
had
simply
done
it
on
the
basis
of
notice
and
comment,
said
i'm
thinking
about
rescinding
this
because
i'm
uncertain,
uncertainties
have
developed
in
the
last
four
years.
he
receives
notice
and
comments,
writes
an
opinion
saying,
i
have
reviewed
the
notice
and
comments
and
i
still
think
there's
a
good
deal
more
uncertainty
now
than
there
was
in
1977,
period.
is
that
challengeable
under
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard?
well,
it
all
depends
on
what
he
wrote
in
his
opinion.
if
he
set
forth--
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
--that
is
his
opinion.
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
challengeable.
he
has
not
set
forth
any
basis,
any
rational
basis
for
changing
course,
and
that
is
all
that's
required
here
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
agency
had
not
done.
they
had
not
set
forth
any
defensible
basis
for
on
one
day
saying
x
and
on
the
next
day
saying
non-x.
let
me
say
that
there
are
some
points
on
which
we
are--
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
--but
it's
the
same
statute
and
it's
the
same
apa.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
no,
you
can't
do
that.
if
there
is...
if
the
second
man
comes
in
and
looks
at
the
facts
and
can
rationally
set
forth
a
basis,
then
that
is
defensible.
but
it
is
not...
this
is
not
a
political
decision
that
one
is
dealing
with
here.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
change
of
administrations.
this
is
a
question
of
whether
on
this
record
there
is
any
justification
for
scrapping
the
regulation
instead
of
barring
a
belt
that
doesn't
work.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
in
the
pacific
legal
foundation
case,
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
his
reasons
and
said
they
were
defensible
reasons
for
changing
course.
that
same
issue
of
a
different
tactic,
a
different
direction,
arose
there
and
the
court
looked
at
the
decision
and
said
it
was
rational
and
defensible.
the
court
of
appeals
here
searched
this
record,
searched
for
any
basis
for
the
agency
to
reject
a
regulation,
to
rescind
a
regulation,
when
you
had
technology
that
it
admitted
worked
and
saved
lives.
and
it
found...
and
we
would
suggest
they
were
absolutely
right...
that
that
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
under
this
statute,
which
was
to
be
technology-forcing.
here
the
agency
didn't
even
force
technology.
they
didn't
even
pick
the
best
technology.
they
had
their
decision
turn
on
the
worst
technology.
what
the
agency
has
done
is
put
the
industry
back
in
the
driver's
seat
as
far
as
the
pace
of
safety,
and
that
is
directly
contrary
to
the
decision
of
the
congress
that
said
that
this
is
not
going
to
be
the
industry's
ball
game
as
far
as
deciding
when
and
how
safety
progress
will
be
made.
this
is
the
responsibility
of
the
agency.
now,
i
would
say
that
there
are
some
points
on
which
we
had
no
disagreement
with
the
government.
i
think
the
government
tried
to
pick
a
fight
on
what
were
essentially
phantom
issues
in
their
opening
brief.
they
first
said
that
if
this
case
stands
an
agency
will
be
frozen
in
its
tracks,
uncertainty
will
never
be
enough.
well,
we
have
said
that
an
agency
that
can
document
or
support
a
finding
of
uncertainty,
of
course
it
can
change
course.
second,
they
said
that
there
was
a
formal
burden
of
proof
that
this
case
had
imposed
on
the
agency.
we
did
not
read
it
that
way
at
all.
clearly,
the
burden
of
proof...
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
a
party
challenging
an
agency
action,
and
the
court's
assertion
below
that
the
burden,
that
the
burden,
there
was
a
burden
of
explaining,
is
not
much
different
again
than
what
this
court
had
said
in
atchison,
topeka,
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
first
decision
of
the
agency
is
consistent
with
the
statutory
mandate,
and
if
the
agency
reverses
course
there
is
a
duty
to
explain.
we
had
no
difference
with
the
government.
there
was
no
burden
of
proof.
the
court
of
appeals
found,
under
any
standard
of
judicial...
under
any
standard
of
rational
decisionmaking,
the
decision
below
falls.
finally,
we
asserted
that
the
post-enactment
legislative
history
doesn't
ratchet
up
the
standard
of
review.
once
again,
we
did
not
see
that
that
was
how
the
court
of
appeals
was
using
that
legislative
history,
but
if
there
were
any
question
about
that
we
were
not
relying
upon
post-enactment
legislative
history.
we
were
relying
and
do
rely
on
the
standards
of
overton
park,
which
we
believe,
when
you
march
up
the
hill
or
down
the
hill,
you
have
to
pass
muster
under
the
standards
of
that
case.
parenthetically,
we
do,
in
connection
with
the
colloquy
with
justice
stevens,
it's
clear
that
the
cases
that
speak
about
failure
to
act
at
all
are
a
different
genus
than
the
revocation
cases.
the
cases
have
consistently
given
agencies
more
elbow-room
in
failure
to
act
than
in
rescission,
or
revocation
cases.
consistently
the
cases,
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief
involving
revocation,
have
held
the
agency
to
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
now,
let
me
make
a
couple
more
comments
if
i
could
in
connection
with
the
solicitor's
argument.
first,
as
far
as
the
questions
of
safety,
the
key
fact
is
that
at
no
point
has
the
agency
ever
found
that
non-detachable
belts
pose
any
safety
problem
at
all.
in
fact,
all
the
evidence
is
just
to
the
contrary.
we
have
spelled
this
out
in
our
briefs.
in
1978
the
agency
concluded
that
these
non-detachable
spool-release
belts
will
not
cause
serious
occupant
egress
problems.
in
1978
gm,
that
had
proposed
that
particular
kind
of
belt,
said
that
those
belts
would
provide
for
rapid
egress
without
use
of
buckle
release
mechanisms.
and
in
this
very
proceeding,
the
gm
safety
director
said
that
spool
release
is
viable
from
a
safety
egress
point
of
view.
so
there
has
been
no
question
on
this
record
at
all
of
support
for
a
problem
of
egress
with
a
non-detachable
or
spool-release
belt.
in
terms
of
the
suggestion
that
the
agency
continues
to
be
committed
to
a
coleman
plan
or
the
promotion
of
passive
restraints,
that
as
well
is
totally
belied
by
the
record.
first,
there
is
the
suggestion
that
there
be
an
educational
effort
to
convince
people.
paul
newman
will
step
out
of
his
sports
car,
look
you
in
the
eye,
and
say,
"buckle
up".
well,
that
program
had
met
with
such
disfavor
in
the
congress
that
they
have
denied
additional
funds
to
an
educational
program
until...
that
kind
of
educational
program,
until
the
agency
can
demonstrate
that
it's
effective.
second,
they
said
that
they've
asked
for
more
money.
the
solicitor
general
notes
that
the
agency
has
asked
for
$7.5
million
of
funding
for
a
crashworthiness
program.
there
is
no
indication
what
part,
if
any
substantial
part,
is
to
go
to
a
passive
restraint
program.
third,
they've
suggested
that
they're
going
to
have
a
demonstration
program
in
the
government
to
put
air
bags
in
the
cars.
now,
today
the
only
manufacturer
that
is
going
to
produce
air
bags
is
mercedes
and
they're
going
to
make
5,000
cars,
which
leads
to
the
interesting
possibility
of
government
employees
running
their
errands
in
$25,000
and
$30,000
mercedes
automobiles.
there
is
no
other
u.s.
manufacturer
that
is
making
any
kind
of
passive...
there
is
no
u.s.
manufacturer
at
all
that
is
making
any
kind
of
passive
restraint
today.
within
24
hours
of
this
decision,
as
the
court
of
appeals
had
noted,
within
24
hours
of
this
agency
decision,
every
manufacturer
shut
down
its
passive
restraint
program.
today
you
can't
get
any
kind
of
passive
restraint
on
any
american
car
and
you
could
only
get
it
as
an
option
on
a
vw
rabbit,
on
a
vw
jetta,
or
a
toyota
cressida.
so
the
lure
that
there
is
something
right
around
the
corner
in
terms
of
safety
and
protection
for
our
citizens,
as
suggested
by
the
solicitor,
simply
is
belied
by
the
record.
indeed,
it's
rejected.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
well,
i
think
that...
i
think
that
those
facts
are
all
either
stated
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
or
are
matters
of
the
record.
mr.
james
f.
fitzpatrick
well,
the
fact
in
terms
of
the
agency
shutting
down
the
passive
program
clearly
was
described
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
the
fact...
the
solicitor's
brief
speaks
of
the
mercedes
program.
i
do
not
know
that
my
statement
about
the
fact
that
in
1982
that
the
only
cars
that
have
as
an
option
a
passive
belt
is
contained
in
the
record.
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
that,
but
i
don't
think
it's
contained
in
the
record.
now,
in
conclusion
let
me
address
one
final
point.
the
government
has
in
its
reply
brief
attempted
to
cast
this
difference
as
a
rather
squalid
disagreement
between
the
automobile
industry
and
the
insurance
industry.
the
solicitor
said:
"from
the
broader
perspectives
of
the
nation
as
a
whole,
the
decision
is
sound
and
responsible.
"
that
approach
we
think
is
dead
wrong.
but
if
it
were
proper
to
look
at
this
case
from
the
broader
perspectives
of
the
nation
as
a
whole,
then
i
ask
the
court
to
lay
aside
our
brief
and
lay
aside
mr.
cutler's
brief,
and
look
to
the
brief
of
the
epilepsy
foundation
of
america
and
the
national
society
to
prevent
blindness
or
the
brief
of
the
mothers
against
drunk
driving
or
the
brief
of
the
american
college
of
preventative
medicine
or
the
american
academy
of
pediatrics,
to
see
where,
in
the
solicitor's
terms,
from
the
broader
perspective
of
the
nation
as
a
whole,
the
responsible
action
lies.
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
that,
for
the
reasons
we
have
advanced
today
and
in
our
briefs,
the
decision
of
the
agency
rescinding
this
important
and
significant
regulation
to
protect
the
lives
of
our
citizens,
that
rescission
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
was
properly
set
aside.
we'd
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed
and
promptly
so.
we
thank
the
court.
