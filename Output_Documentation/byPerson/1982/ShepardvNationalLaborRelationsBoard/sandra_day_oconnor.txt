mr.
gore,
this
is
a
minor
point,
but
is
reimbursement
being
sought
by
mr.
shepard
for
the
contribution
to
union
benefit
funds
as
well
as
for
initiation
fees
and
union
dues?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
operators
contributed
to
the
benefit
funds
as
a
result
of
the
illegal
provision
in
the
master
labor
agreement?
justice
sandra

mr.
kneedler--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
isn't
really
clear,
though,
is
it,
why
the
board
denied
the
relief
here?
it
isn't
clear
whether
the
board
was
relying
on
its
general
discretion
here.
it
may
have
articulated
some
reasons
that
are
all
erroneous.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
seem
to
agree
that
that
was
probably
erroneous.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
do
agree
with
that?
