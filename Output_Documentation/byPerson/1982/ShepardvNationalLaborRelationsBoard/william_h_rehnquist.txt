the
alj
doesn't
himself
issue
cease
and
desist
orders,
does
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
becomes
a
final
order?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying,
mr.
gore,
that
the
board
must
order
reimbursement
or
make
whole
in
a
situation
like
this
just
categorically,
or
that
it
abused
its
discretion
in
not
doing
so
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
congress
set
up
a
remedial
scheme,
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
board
has
all
the
powers
of
a
common
law
court
after
law
and
equity--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
presumably
to
decline
to
fashion
some
policies
that
it
thought
wouldn't
effectuate--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the...
what
if
it
is
proved
satisfactorily
that
the
agreement
causes
the
kind
of...
an
independent
businessman
to
join
the
union?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
a
coercion
on
the
employee
or
the
independent
contractor
employee
is
irrelevant--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
coercion
might...
exercised
against
these
independent
operators
might
violate
some
other
provision,
but
it
wouldn't
violate
8(b)(4).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
even
coercion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
one
could
affirm
the
judgment
below
and
rule
basically
in
the
board's
favor
without
coming
to
any
conclusion
as
to
whether
an
8(e)
violation
might
be
remediable
under
303.

petitioner
larry
shepard
owns
a
dump
truck,
and
operates
it
in
the
san
diego
area
to
haul
materials
to
and
from
construction
sites.
before
1977,
he
wasn't
a
member
of
any
union.
in
1977,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
teamsters
local
36,
entered
into
a
new
contract
with
local
contractors
which
prohibited
hiring
nonunion
truckers.
shepard
was
told
he
would
have
to
join
the
union.
he
joined
under
protest
and
paid
an
initiation
fee
and
dues.
he
then
filed
charges
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
board
found
that
the
contract
was
illegal
under
the
provision
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
prohibits
so-called
?hot
cargo?
contracts.
the
board
ordered
the
union
and
contractors
to
stop
enforcing
the
contract
but
it
did
not
order
them
to
reimburse
shepard
for
the
money
he
had
paid
the
union.
shepard
petitioned
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
agreed
with
the
board.
we
granted
shepard's
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
congress
has
given
the
board
authority
to
determine
when
a
particular
remedy
would
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
because
the
board
has
special
expertise
in
this
area,
we
understand
the
board
to
have
decided
to
order
reimbursement
only
in
especially
serious
situations
where
a
union
uses
threats,
picketing,
a
strike,
or
other
actual
coercion.
no
such
tactics
were
used
in
this
case.
shepard
argues
that
the
board
should
give
him
what
he
calls
?complete
relief?.
but
the
board
is
not
a
court
created
to
resolve
private
disputes,
it's
an
administrative
agency
responsible
for
the
federal
labor
laws
and
for
stopping
and
preventing
unfair
labor
practices.
congress
did
not
authorize
the
board
to
award
full
compensation
for
all
injuries
caused
by
wrongful
conduct.
since
nothing
in
the
act
requires
the
board
to
order
that
a
complaining
--
what
a
complaining
party
thinks
is
complete
relief,
we
find
that
the
board
was
within
its
authority
in
refusing
to
order
reimbursement.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
affirmed.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
