mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
section
10(c)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
vests
the
board
with
broad
discretion
to
fashion
the
remedy
for
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
it
believes
is
appropriate
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
remedy
selected
by
the
board
from
the
range
of
remedies
available
to
it
was
in
a
court's
view
the
proper
remedy
to
select,
but
rather,
whether
the
remedy
chosen
by
the
board
was
within
the
range
of
remedies
available
to
it,
or,
put
another
way,
whether
it
abused
its
discretion.
we
agree
with
the
petitioner
in
this
case
that
section
303
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
does
not
afford
a
remedy
to
someone
who
is
injured
by
a
bare
8(e)
violation,
that
is,
by
the
existence
and
implementation
of
an
agreement
that
was
entered
into
in
violation
of
section
8(e).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
justice
white,
unless
the
union
resorted
to
conduct
that
would
independently
violate
section
8(b)(4),
either
to
force
the
employer
to
sign
the
agreement
in
the
first
instance
or
after
it
was
signed
to
force
the
employer
to
abide
by
it,
of
course,
in
that
situation
there
would
be
a
damage
remedy
under
section
303.
that
is
what
congress
intended.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
section
8(b)(4)
is
part
of
the
secondary
activity
provisions
of
the
act,
and
it
looks
to
the...
excuse
me...
presence
or
absence
of
coercion
on,
in
this
case,
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct,
and
if
i
could
just
make
one
additional
point
on
that,
the
decision
of
the
administrative
law
judge
only
says
on
page
43a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
says
that
the...
it
having
been
found
that
the
union
and
the
associations
enforced
provisions
of
the
mla
requiring
owner-operators
to
make
payments
to
the
union
of
dues,
initiation
fees,
assessments,
and
contributions
to
trust
funds
in
violation
of
section
8(e),
it
would
then...
the
alj
would
then
recommend
an
order
of
the
refunds.
that
may
well
establish
causation,
at
least
for
the
particular...
at
least
for
mr.
shepard.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
coercion
perhaps
in
some
other
sense,
but
the
type
of
coercion
to
which
section
8(b)(4)
speaks,
it
would
not,
and
in
fact
this
court's
decisions
in
servett
and
teamsters
versus
morton
make
that
unmistakably
clear.
there,
the
court
said
that
the
mere
request
by
a
union
to
an
employer
to
cease
doing
business
with
another
person
does
not
violate
section
8(b)(4),
and
in
this
instance,
when
the
union
sent
a
letter
to
the
employer,
what
happened
is,
the
union
called
the
employer's
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
were
several
independent
contractors
who
were
not
union
members,
and
requested
that
the
broker,
terra
trucking
company,
cease
using
the
services
of
those
owner-operators,
but
that
is
precisely
the
sort
of
request
that
this
court
said
in
servett
and
teamsters
versus
morton
is
not
coercive
for
purposes
of
section
8(b)(4).
but
quite
aside
from
that,
if
petitioner
disagreed
with
that
proposition
in
that
there
was
in
fact
8(b)(4)
coercion
in
this
case,
he
was,
of
course,
free
to
file
the
remedy
that
congress
contemplated
in
those
circumstances,
a
suit
under
section
303
of
the
act
to
recover
damages
for
injuries
sustained
as
a
result
of
a
section
8(b)(4)
violation,
and
the
fact
that
the
board
did
not
in
this
case
find
a
setion
8(b)(4)
violation
would
not
preclude
mr.
shepard
or
any
other
owner-operator
from
establishing
such
a
violation
in
a
separate
section
303
proceeding.
and
indeed,
we
think
that
although
we
agree
with
petitioner
that
there
is
not
a
damage
remedy
available
under
section
303
for
a
bare
8(e)
violation,
which
is
all
the
board
found
here,
petitioner
draws
precisely
the
wrong
conclusion
from
that
fact.
when
congress
amended
the
act
in
1959
to
outlaw
hot
cargo
agreements
for
the
first
time,
it
also
amended
section
8(b)(4)
to
bar
union
coercion
to
force
the
employer
to
enter
into
such
an
agreement.
it
amended
section
10(l),
which
provides
mandatory
preliminary
injunctive
relief
in
the
case
of
secondary
activity,
and
provided
that
the
general
counsel
must
seek
an
injunction
where
there
is
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
secondary
activity.
congress
amended
section
10(l)
to
require
the
general
counsel
to
seek
such
an
injunction
in
cases
involving
section
8(e)
violations,
but
significantly,
congress
did
not
amend
section
303,
the
damage
provision
of
the
statute,
to
provide
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
or
monetary
relief
for
a
bare
section
8(e)
violation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but...
and
we
are
not
saying
by
the
same
token
that
the
failure
of
congress
to
provide
a
damage
remedy
under
section
303
forecloses
the
board
itself
from
awarding
a
reimbursement
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
the
question
of
whether
the
board
has
the
power
to
order
such
relief
for
an
8(e)
violation--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
did.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
i
don't
say
that
it's
wrong,
no.
what
i...
all
i
am
saying
is
that
that
establishes
the
reasonableness
of
the
board's
general
approach
to
these
cases,
which
i
think
would...
i
can't
speak
for
what
the
board
would
do
in
any
particular
case,
but
looking
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
an
8(e)
violation
without
some
additional
aggravating
circumstance,
at
least,
would
not,
at
least
in
this
case,
did
not
cause
the
board
to
issue
or
order
additional
relief.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that,
for
instance,
if
there
was
additional
action
on
behalf
of
the
employer
and
union
in
another
case,
that
the
board
may
not
consider
whether
it
would
be
appropriate
to
order
reimbursement.
for
example,
if,
notwithstanding
a
board
cease
and
desist
order,
the
union
and
employer
go
back
and
once
again
enter
into
precisely
or
virtually
identical
8(e)
violation,
then
there
would
be
time
enough
for
the
board
to
consider
whether
some
additional
reimbursement
remedy
would
be
appropriate,
since
the
union
and
employer
would
have
by
that
point
revealed
that
they
were
not
going
to
abide
by
the
board's
cease
and
desist
order.
but
in
this
case,
there
was
no
reason...
no
aggravating
circumstances
for
the
board...
to
give
the
board
reason
to
believe
that
a
reimbursement
order
was
necessary
to
create
that
sort
of
disincentive,
and
in
fact
one
of
the
chief
reasons
for
this
is
that
there
was
the
ongoing
litigation
over
the
question,
as
counsel
for
petitioner
has
pointed
out,
over
the
question
of
whether
these
owner-operators
were
even
independent
contractors.
if
they
were
employees,
then
the
application
of
the
master
labor
agreement
to
them
and
the...
including
the
union
security
provisions
to
them
would
have
been
lawful,
and
the
union's
efforts
to
enforce
that
requirement
in
the
master
labor
agreement
would
have
been
lawful.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
my
understanding--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--excuse
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
original
charge
filed
by
mr.
shepard
was
based
on
or
alleged
what
amounted
to
an
8(b)(4)
violation,
alleging,
incidentally,
not
that
the
union
was
coercing
mr.
shepard,
but
consistent
with
the
secondary
aspect
of
section
8(b)(4),
alleged
that
the
union
was
coercing
terra,
the
broker,
by
virtue
of
the
existence
of
the
agreement.
but
as
i
understand
the
board's
practice
or
the
general
counsel's
practice,
if
he
chooses
not
to
file
a
complaint
based
on
a
charge
that
is
filed
with
him
because
he
believes,
for
example,
that
the
evidence
would
not
support
the
charge
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
in
this
case
a
charge
of
an
8(b)(4)
violation,
he
will
give
the
charging
party
an
opportunity
to
withdraw
the
charge,
and
file
a
complaint
based
on
those
violations
that
the
general
counsel
does
believe
are
present.
so,
my
understanding
of
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
the
general
counsel
gave
petitioner
an
opportunity
to
withdraw
his
charge,
and
refile
alleging
a
violation
of
section
8(e).
if
the
charging
party
doesn't
withdraw
his
charge
in
that
fashion,
he
has
a
right
of
appeal
to
the
general
counsel's
office
here
in
washington
to
seek
to
have
the
general
counsel
file
a
complaint,
but
in
this
case,
in
lieu
of
doing
that,
as
i
understand
what
happened,
mr.
shepard
withdrew
the
charge--
but
apparently
it
was
the
general
counsel's
view
that
this
case
only
warranted
going
forward
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
presented
under
section
8(e).
as
i
mentioned,
the
special
statutory
scheme
that
congress
fashioned
in
the
area
of
secondary
activity
and
its
meticulous
attention
to
those
circumstances
in
which
it
would
afford
various
remedies
we
think
establishes
that
congress's
withholding
of
a
damage
remedy
for
a
bare
8(b)
violation
was
deliberate.
just
to
reiterate
for
a
moment,
congress
added
section
8(e)
in
the
act
in
'59,
provided
the
mandatory
preliminary
injunctive
remedy
in
1959,
but
did
not
amend
section
303
to
provide
an
automatic
damage
remedy
for
the
individual,
and
we
think
that
congress
evidently
concluded
that
an
8(b)(4)
violation
involving
coercion
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
of
a
different
order
in
section
8(e),
and
that
it
was
not
necessary
in
order
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act
to
provide
a
damage
remedy
on
the
basis
of
a
bare
8(e)
violation,
and
we
think
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
under...
depending
on...
two
remedies.
under
section
303,
we
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
they
do
not
have
a
remedy
because
section
303
expressly
refers
to
section
8(e).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
with
respect
to
section
10(c),
in
order
to...
the
general
remedial
provision
for
the
board
to
award
relief,
the
important
point
to
recognize
there
is
that
section
10(c)
is
not
a
replication
of
a
private
damage
action
such
as
303.
this
court
made
clear
in
automobile
workers
versus
russell
that
congress
did
not
establish
in
section
10(c)
a
comprehensive
scheme
for
compensating
victims
of
wrongful
conduct,
that
section
10(c)
was
instead...
the
affirmative
action
that
the
board
can
award
under
section
10(c)
is
incidental
to
its
power--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
again,
under
section
303,
that
is
the
distinction
that
congress
has
drawn,
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
at
the
very
least,
it
cannot
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
board
to
draw
a
parallel
judgment
in
its
administration
of
the
administrative
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings.
if
congress
determined
that
a
section
8(e)
violation
was
a
violation
of
a
different
order,
then
the
board,
looking
to
the
absence
of
the
8(b)
coercion,
could
draw
the
same
conclusion.
this
court
said
in
gissel
packing
company
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
giving
the
board
discretion
to
fashion
the
appropriate
remedy
was
to
permit
it
to
tailor
its
remedy
to
unfair
labor
practices
of
varying
intensity,
as
the
court
put
it,
and
i
think
that
in
determining
the
intensity
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
board
to
look
only
to
the
resulting
impact
on
the
owner-operators
in
this
case.
it
is
equally
appropriate
for
the
board
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
conduct
of
those
who
committed
the
unfair
labor
practice.
and
this
is
so
for
a
very
important
reason.
as
i
was
mentioning
earlier,
section
10(c)
does
not,
when
the
board
awards
affirmative
action
under
section
10(c),
this
is
not
a
redress
for
a
private
wrong
in
the
manner
of
a
lawsuit
under
section
303
of
the
act.
it
instead
vindicates
the
public
right
in
stopping
unfair
labor
practices,
and
in
restoring
industrial
peace
and
the
free
flow
of
commerce.
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
board
did
say
that...
well,
it
said
several
things.
it
did
refer
to
the
existence
of
a
remedy
under
section
303
of
the
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
don't
concede
that
that
was
erroneous.
what
i...
the
point
i
was...
in
fact,
to
the
contrary.
as
i
have
described,
under
section
303
of
the
act,
congress
made
a
judgment
that
monetary
relief
need
not
be
available
in
a
district
court
suit
to
someone
who
is
injured
by
a
bare
8(e)
violation,
and
as
i
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
was...
as
i
interpret
the
board's
order,
its
point
was
that
congress
has
dealt
with
several,
but
one
being
that
when
you
have
third
parties
who
are
injured
by
a
union's
secondary
activity,
congress
provided
a
separate
forum
for
a
person
to
recover
for
a
union's
secondary...
unlawful
secondary
activities.
now,
it
may
be
that
because
of
the
lines
congress
drew,
that
there
is
no
remedy
for
a
bare
8(e)
violation,
but
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
do
agree
with
that,
but
i
draw
the
opposite
conclusion
from
that
than
petitioner
does,
because
congress's
foreclosing
of
a
damage
remedy
for
the
individual
demonstrates
that
congress
did
not
believe
that
monetary
relief
was
necessary
as
a
rule
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act,
and
the
board
has
simply
made
a
parallel
judgment
in
administering
the
separate
administrative
proceedings
under
section
10(c).
and
the
reason
why
i
think
that
is
especially
important
is
that
the...
in
some...
the
purpose
of
the
board's
remedial
scheme
is
to
eliminate
obstacles
to
the
restoring
of
industrial
peace
and
to
stop
and
prevent
unfair
labor
practices.
in
some
situations,
again,
as
the
court
noted
in
gissel,
it
may
be
appropriate
just
to
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order,
if
the
board
is
satisfied
that
that
would
be
sufficient
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act,
because,
for
example,
there
may
be
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
violation
will
recur.
in
other
circumstances,
though,
the
board
may
believe
that
some
further
measures
may
be
necessary,
perhaps
because
of...
in
situations
involving
unfair
labor
practice
affecting
employees,
that
the...
that
there
may
be
certain
lingering
consequences
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
that
it
is
not
enough
to
simply
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order,
that
the
board
may
have
to
go
further.
and
this
is
the
point
that
the
court
made
in
the
carpenters
local
60
case
that
counsel
for
petitioner
cited.
in
carpenters
local
60,
it
is
true
that
the
court
reversed
the
reimbursement
remedy
there
because
it
found
that
there
was
not
even
a
consequence
of
a
violation,
that
none
of
the
union...
none
of
the
employees
involved
there
had
joined
the
union
because
of
the
closed
shop
arrangement.
but
the
court
didn't
stop
there.
it
pointed
out,
quoting
the
earlier
decision
in
consolidated
edison,
that
the
power
of
the
board
to
award
affirmative
relief
is
the
power
to
eliminate
consequences
of
violation
where
those
consequences
would
thwart
the
accomplishment
of
the
act's
purposes.
so,
just
because
there
may
be
a
consequence
of
the
violation
that
may
remain,
it
does
not
mean
that
that
consequence
will
thwart
the
policies
of
the
act.
and
the
board
can
conclude
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
that
reason
to
go
ahead
and
order
affirmative
relief.
this
court
said
in
auto
workers
versus
russell
that
the
power
to
award
reimbursement,
even
the
affirmative
action
that
is
expressly
mentioned
in
the
act,
back
pay,
doesn't
flow
automatically
from
the
finding
of
a
violation
and
injury.
the
board
must
first
be
convinced
that
the
awarding
of
the
affirmative
action,
in
that
case
back
pay,
would
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
and
we
submit
that
where
the
board
is
not
convinced
that
going
further
than
the
cease
and
desist
order,
going
beyond
the
cease
and
desist
order
to
restrain
future
violations,
where
the
board
is
convinced
that
nothing
more
is
necessary
or
appropriate,
that
that
is
precisely
the
sort
of
discretionary
decision
that
was
submitted,
that
the
congress
conferred
on
the
board.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
board's
exercise
of
its
discretion
under
section
10(c)
to
fashion
an
appropriate
remedy
is
subject
to
very
narrow
judicial
review,
and
in
fact
in
virginia
electric
power
company,
one
of
the
earlier
cases
decided
under
the
act,
the
court
phrased
the
test
in
terms
of...
by
stating,
the
board's
order
should
stand
"unless
it
can
be
shown
that
the
order
is
a
patent
attempt
to
achieve
ends
other
than
those
which
can
fairly
be
said
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
"
now,
that
language,
we
submit,
reflects
a
broad
deference
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
the
decisions
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
in
this
case,
there
is
an
additional
factor
that
is
present.
this
isn't
a
case
like
vepco,
or
the
typical
case
that
has
come
to
this
court,
or
even
the
courts
of
appeals,
regarding
the
board's
remedial
powers.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
it
is
asserted
that
the
board
has
gone
too
far,
and
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
consider
what
the
power
of
the
board
is.
here,
the
allegation
is,
or
the
assertion
is
that
the
board's
order
did
not
go
far
enough
in
the
submission
of
petitioner,
and
in
those
sort
of
circumstances
where
the
assertion
is
that
the
board
has
not
gone
far
enough,
we
submit
that
the
party
challenging
the
board's
order
should
be
required
to
show,
as
the
d.c.
circuit
has
said
in
several
of
their
decisions,
that
the
remedy
the
board
did
order
will
be
so
ineffective
to
enforce
the
policies
of
the
act
as
to
be
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law,
or
that,
in
other
words,
the
board
has
abandoned
any
exercise
of
its
discretion,
and
it
has
in
fact
done
nothing
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
well,
in
this
case,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
cease
and
desist
order
will
be
so
ineffective
to
accomplish
the
act's
purposes
as
to
be
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law.
we
think
that
is
plainly
not
so.
first
of
all,
we
think,
as
i
explained
before,
that
the
board's
decision
draws
powerful
support
from
the
judgment
congress
itself
made,
that
monetary
relief
does
not
have
to
follow,
and
secondly,
that
by
enacting
section
303,
congress
made
a
judgment
that
third
parties
who
in
effect
stand
outside
the
triangle
of
the
usual
employer-employee-union
relationship,
that
their
remedies
generally
should
be
in
a
section
303
action
in
federal
district
court.
they
shouldn't...
the
board
was
thought
to
be
an
inappropriate
forum
ordinarily
for
adjudicating
the
consequences
of
parties'
unfair
labor
practices.
the
board
called
attention
to
the
existence
of
the
section
303
remedy
in
this
case,
and
we
think
that,
too,
supports
the
board's
decision
not
to
go
further
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
in
fact--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
santini
brothers
decision
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
is
precisely
that
situation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
has
not
come
up
that
often,
but
santini
brothers--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
monetary
relief,
but
it
also
contains
the
element
of
coercion
in
the
8(b)(4)
violation,
which
is
consistent
with
congress's
judgment
in
303.
again,
the
parallel
is
complete.
where
there
is
the
8(b)(4)
violation
that
would
give
rise
to
a
damage
remedy
in
court,
the
board
under
santini
brothers
has
gone
ahead
and
ordered
the
reimbursement
remedy.
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
board
would
find
it
appropriate
to
enter
into
a
full
compensatory
scheme
under
section
10(c),
because
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
the
legislative
history
of
section
303
makes
it
clear
that
congress
did
not
believe
in
general
that
the
board
was
the
appropriate
forum
for
third
parties
to
litigate
the
damages
that
they
have
suffered
as
a
result
of
the
union's
activities.
and
so,
for
instance,
in
this
case,
if
an
owner-operator,
instead
of
joining
the
union,
decided...
resisted
and
lost
work
as
a
result,
that
is
precisely
the
sort
of
consequential
damages,
lost
profits
and
what
not,
that
congress
assigned
to
the
courts,
not
to
the
board.
and
so
it
is
clear
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
board
to
depart
on
a
broad
scale
to
establish
those
sorts
of
remedies.
but
in
the
santini
brothers
case,
the
remedy
was
limited.
even
though
this
lost
profits
sort
of
relief
was
sought,
the
board
simply
awarded
a
reimbursement
remedy
against
the
union,
but
the
board
found
8(b)(4)
violations
in
the
facts
of
santini
brothers.
but
there
is
no
case
where
the
board
has
on
the
basis
of
a
bare
8(e)
violation
awarded
relief.
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
explained,
then,
we
think
that
the
statutory
scheme
does
not
contemplate
that
the
board
must
go
ahead
and
award
the
reimbursement
remedy
that
was
requested
in
this
case.
in
addition,
the
facts
of
this
case
do
not
suggest
that
the
board
should
depart
from
the
practice
suggested
by
congress's
enactment
of
section
303.
there
was
no
showing
of
extensive
violations
or
injury
as
a
result
of
the
existence
of
the
8(e)
violation.
we
have
evidence
in
the
record
only
pertaining
to
two
brokers,
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
joining
the
union
only
as
to
terra.
petitioner
himself
signed
a
subhall
agreement
when
he
first
came
to
work
for...
first
went
to
work
through
his
broker,
in
which
he
agreed
to
have
union
fringe
benefits
deducted
from
his
checks,
and
there
is
no
indication
that
he
resisted
that
or
protested
that.
it
was
only
when
he
also
had
to
pay
the
union
dues
and
fees
that
he
resisted.
so,
even
though
mr.
shepard
is
not
seeking
a
refund
of
fringe
benefits
to
certain
trust
funds,
as
we
are
told
now,
he
still
benefitted
during
that
period
from
having
been
working
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
secured
by
the
union
that
in
fact
provided
those
fringe
benefit
plans.
another
factor
present
here
is
the
one
i
have
mentioned
before,
that
there
was
ongoing
litigation,
and
indeed
the
board
itself
had
held
that
these
persons
were
not
independent
contractors,
but
were
employees,
and
it
was
not
until
after
this
agreement
was
entered
into
that
the
ninth
circuit
changed
its
view
on
that
subject,
and
even
then
the
board
denies...
it
does
not
have
to
acquiesce
in
that
decision.
it
was
still...
it
was
not
until
later
that
the
board
changed
its
view
and
said
that
these
were
independent
contractors.
so,
the
board
could
legitimately
take
into
account
that
the
fact
that
the
status
of
the
owner-operators
was
uncertain,
and
indeed
there
was
case
law
supporting
that
they
were
employees,
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
award
a
reimbursement
remedy
to
deter
future
violations.
it
could
instead
conclude
that
once
this
legal
question
was
cleared
up,
that
the
union
and
the
employer
would
abide
by
the
result
the
board
reached
and
that
the
courts
have
reached.
and
then,
finally,
with
respect
to
the
distinction
between
the
award
of
reimbursement
to
an
employee
and
the
award
of
reimbursement
to
someone
who
stands
outside
the
employment
relationship,
in
this
case,
an
independent
contractor,
we
think
there
is
a
big
difference.
employees
have
section
7
rights,
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
or
to
refrain
from
that,
to
select
a
collective
bargaining
agent
or
not,
and
this
board...
or
this
court
in
virginia
electric
power
and
subsequent
cases
has
recognized
that
when
the
company
or
the
union
takes
action
that
might
impact
upon
the
section
7
rights,
that
it
may
be
necessary
to
refund
or
reimburse
the
employees
for
their
dues,
so
that
the
dues
will
not
continue
to
maintain
a
company-dominated
union
or
a
closed
shop
in
order
to
undo
the
consequences
so
the
employees
will
feel
free
to
engage
in
section
7
activities
in
the
future.
that
doesn't
apply
necessarily
to
independent
contractors.
they
do
not
work
in
the
close
confines
of
an
employee-employer
relationship
with
the
union
being
present.
they
are
independent
businessmen,
and
in
this
case,
in
fact,
the
record
shows
that
most
of
the
independent
contractors
worked
through
a
number
of
brokers,
with
a
number
of
contractors.
they
go
from
day
to
day
to
different
sites.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
independent
businessmen
like
that
need
the
same
sort
of
protection
in
the
form
of
a
reimbursement
remedy
as
employees
do
with
respect
to
section
7
rights.
and
we
think
that
this
in
part
explains
the
difference
that
congress
drew
when
it
did
not
provide
a
damage
remedy
for
bare
8(e)
violations
for
third
parties
such
as
independent
contractors
or
other
employers
with
whom
the
primary...
or
with
whom
the
employer
might
cease
doing
business.
congress
decided
that
reimbursement
was
appropriate
only
in
the
case
of
aggravated
coercion
by
the
union.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
