mr.
robert
f.
gore
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
basic
dispute
in
this
case
has
been
going
on
for
12
years.
i
will
not
review
the
12
years
of
litigation
history.
it
is
adequately
covered
in
the
briefs.
i
would,
however,
like
to
highlight
some
key
facts.
the
original
dispute
involves
the
employment
status
of
owner-operators
of
dump
trucks
who
haul
materials
to
and
from
construction
sites.
the
question
is
whether
they
are
independent
contractors
or
employees.
this
employment
status
determines
many
things,
including
whether
these
owner-operators
could
be
required
to
join
or
support
the
teamsters
union.
in
1977,
while
the
employment
status
was
still
being
litigated,
the
teamsters
union
and
various
contractors'
associations
in
san
diego
county
voluntarily
entered
into
new
master
labor
agreements
requiring
that
the
contractors
treat
these
owner-operators
as
employees.
the
teamsters
union,
through
contractors,
then
enforced
the
master
labor
agreements,
requiring
that
the
non-union
owner-operators
join
the
teamsters
union.
in
order
to
stay
in
business,
the
petitioner
and
other
owner-operators
joined
the
union
under
protest.
they
paid
their
initiation
fees,
monthly
dues,
and
fringe
benefit
contributions.
they
then
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
the
original
unfair
labor
practice
charge
alleged
a
violation
of
the
secondary
boycott
prohibitions
of
the
act,
section
8(b)(4).
at
the
request
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
these
charges
were
withdrawn,
and
a
hot
cargo
violation
was
then
alleged,
a
violation
of
section
8(e).
petitioner's
unfair
labor
practice
charges
were
consolidated
with
similar
charges
by
the
california
dump
truck
owners
association,
and
the
board
issued
a
complaint.
almost
eight
months
after
being
required
to
join
the
union,
a
federal
court
enjoined
further
enforcement
of
the
hot
cargo
provisions,
pending
a
determination
by
the
board.
after
a
hearing,
the
administrative
law
judge
found
that
the
owner-operators
were
in
fact
independent
contractors,
and
that
the
challenged
provisions
of
the
master
labor
agreement
were
a
violation
of
section
8(e).
he
issued
a
narrow
cease
and
desist
order,
and
ordered
the
employer
associations
and
the
union
to
make
the
owner-operators
whole.
the
board
affirmed
the
alj's
findings--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--justice
rehnquist,
he
issues
a
proposed
decision
order,
and
if
it
is
not
appealed
to
the
board,
it
becomes
a
final
order.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes.
now,
the
board
affirmed
the
alj's
findings
of
facts,
but
refused
to
grant
the
make
whole
remedy.
the
board
gave
three
reasons
for
denying
the
make
whole
remedy.
they
are
contained
in
the
footnote.
they
consist
of
three
sentences,
75
words.
that
is
the
only
guidance
we
get
from
the
board.
all
the
parties
petitioned
for
review
in
various
courts
of
appeals,
and
we
had
a
race
to
the
courthouse--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--it
is
footnote
2,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
it
would
be
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
it
should
be
on
page
17a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
enforced
the
board's
order
in
all
respects.
in
a
similar
case
involving
almost
identical
language
in
the
southern
california
master
labor
agreement,
the
board
issued
a
similar
order.
the
ninth
circuit
rejected
the
board's
rationale
for
denying
a
make
whole
remedy.
the
issue
here
is
not...
the
petitioner
agrees,
first
of
all,
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
board
has
the
power
to
grant
a
make
whole
remedy.
rather,
the
issue
is
whether
the
board
improperly
refused
to
grant
a
make
whole
remedy
to
the
victims
of
an
illegal
hot
cargo
agreement.
the
board's
three
reasons
for
not
granting
this
remedy
were:
one,
insufficient
evidence
in
the
record
with
respect
to
alleged
losses
directly
attributable
to
actual
coercion
by
the
respondentse
two,
a
reimbursement
order
typically
used
to
make
whole
employees
to
be
generally
overbroad
and
inappropriate
in
the
context
of
an
8(e)
violation;
and
finally,
the
board
noted
that
the
aggrieved
owner-operators,
because
they
were
engaged
in
business
as
independent
contractors,
could
pursue
a
damage
claim
under
section
303.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
it
is
our
position,
justice
brennan,
that
they
could
not
pursue
a
303
action
unless
there
had
been
also
a
violation
of
8(b)(4),
and
i
think
we
quoted
in
our
brief
here
a
concurring
with
justice
stewart
in
the
connell
dissent.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir.
it
is
our
petition...
or
it
is
our
position
that
the
board
misconstrued
the
statute
and
abused
its
discretion
because
each
of
these
three
reasons
that
it
stated
is
flawed.
because
of
time
constraints,
i
will
only
highlight
the
flaws
in
two
of
the
reasons,
and
then
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
third
reason
in
some
detail.
the
first
reason,
the
availability
of
a
303
suit,
our
position
is
adequately
stated,
i
believe,
in
pages
28
to
39
of
our
brief,
and
also
in
pages
59
to
62
of
the
california
dump
truck
brief.
in
a
nutshell,
we
believe
that
neither
the
statutory
language
nor
the
legislative
history
support
the
board's
assumption
that
a
303
action
is
available
for
a
voluntary
hot
cargo
agreement,
and
secondly,
the
board
could
not
avoid
its
statutory
responsibility
because
of
a
possible
alternate
forum.
at
pages
40
and
41
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
apparently
they
now
concede
that
the
board's
reliance
on
303
was
misplaced.
the
second
reason
given
by
the
board
is
insufficient
evidence
of
losses
directly
attributable
to
actual
coercion.
as
to
the
non-union
owner-operators,
using
terra
trucking
as
a
broker,
the
board's
reason
is
incorrect.
the
board
affirmed
the
alj's
findings
of
fact,
and
he
had
found
in
the
record
that
the
union
sent
a
letter
demanding
that
the
broker
not
employ
the
non-union
owner-operators
until
the
union
cleared
them.
he
also
held
that
terra
trucking
told
these
non-union
owner-operators
to
either
join
the
union
or
he
would
cease
using
their
services.
he
gave
them
five
days
in
which
to
do
it.
the
alj
also
found
that
shepard
and
others
joined
as
a
result
of
the
union
letter,
and
that
shepard
joined
the
union
under
protest.
the
alj
pointed
out
that
the
owner-operators
had
two
choices,
become
an
employee,
and
therefore
a
union
member,
against
their
will,
or
go
out
of
business.
and
the
alj
also
found
that
union
membership
resulted
from
the
hot
cargo
provisions
that
had
been
enforced
by
both
the
employers
and
the
union.
given
these
undisputed
findings
of
fact,
the
board's
stated
reason
is
incorrect,
and
i
believe
an
additional
reason
here
is
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
similar
case.
it
held
that
when
an
unlawful
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
itself
coercive,
there
is
no
logical
reason
for
denying
a
reimbursement
order
because
there
is
no
technical
violation
of
8(b)(4).
in
both
instances,
if
you
focus
on
the
victim,
he
has
lost
the
same
thing,
and
been
compelled
to
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
only
for
one
of
the
three
funds,
justice
o'connor.
there
are
three
funds,
vacation
and
health
and
welfare.
he
did
get
his
vacation
money
back
from
that.
he
could
have,
if
he
had
had
an
injury,
maybe
get
health
and
welfare.
the
pension
fund,
we
would
maintain
would
be--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--it
was
never
really
pursued.
however,
i
believe,
on
page
43
of
the
alj's
decision,
he
specifically
finds
the
contractor
associations,
and
their
findings
of...
they
alleged
it
as
a
defense,
and
the
alj
found
that
it
was
not
a
defense,
the
fact
that
previously
he
had
signed
a
short...
a
leasing
agreement
that
authorized
the
broker
to
deduct
these.
so
the
alj
specifically
found
that
it
was
because
of
the
master
labor
agreement.
that
brings
me
to
the
third
stated
reason
that
the
board--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--we
believe
that
there
was
coercion.
the
contract
itself--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--if
there
was
coercion...
you
mean
an
8(b)(4)
remedy?
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
i
believe,
if
we
could
prove
coercion
enough
to
satisfy
a
coercive
secondary
boycott,
we
could
have
proceeded
under
303.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
justice
stevens.
we
looked
at
it
at
the
time,
and
what
we
had
here,
you
can
find
coercion.
i
think
there
is
a
board
case
called
sheraton-kauai,
where
you
can
prove
actual
direct
coercion
or
it
can
be
inferred
from
the
enforcement
of
the
union
security
agreement.
what
we
had
here
was
an
inference
of
coercion,
and
whether
we
could
take
that
into
federal
court
and
get
a
damage
suit,
it
didn't
seem
cost
effective,
and
it
was
close
whether
we
would
be
there,
whereas
if
we
came
in
under
8(e)
it
was
inexpensive,
it
was
rapid,
and
we
thought
we
would
get
our
remedy.
it
turned
out--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--excuse
me.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
his
statement
of
facts
as
he
specifically
says
is
that
shepard
and
the
others
joined
as
a
result
of
the
union
letter,
and
that
union
membership
resulted
from
the
hot
cargo
provision,
and
this
letter
from
the
union
to
the
broker,
and
then
the
broker
told
everybody,
join
the
union
or
we
will
cease
doing
business
with
you.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir.
they
joined
the
next
day
and
filed
unlabor
practice
charges.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir.
the
union
sent
a
letter
to
the
broker
and
said,
execute
the
contract
we've
got.
the
broker
told
them,
join
the
union
within
five
days
or
i
will
cease
doing
business
with
you.
they
called
for
legal
assistance.
we
paid
the
money
under
protest,
and
we
filed
charges.
so
we
worked
now
and
grieved
later,
because
the
alternative
was
to
go
out
of
business,
which
was
unacceptable
to
the
client.
the
third
reason
the
board
gives,
and
we
find
is
a
major
problem,
is
the
board's
sweeping
policy
statement,
the
second
reason.
it
says
that
reimbursement
orders
typically
used
to
make
whole
employees
are
generally
overbroad
and
inappropriate
to
remedy
8(e)
violations.
this
policy
statement,
without
any
discussion
of
the
underlying
rationale,
is
erroneous
for
many
reasons.
one,
it
misconstrues
the
remedial
system
congress
established
to
handle
secondary
activity.
it
improperly
links
section
8(e),
the
voluntary
hot
cargo
provision,
with
section
8(b)(4)
of
coercive
secondary
boycott,
it
improperly
conditions
a
make
whole
remedy
on
the
employment
status
of
the
victim.
if
you
are
an
employee,
you
get
a
remedy.
if
you
are
an
independent
contractor,
no
remedy.
it
ignores
analogous
board
precedents.
there
are
some
cases
that
are
almost
identically
on
point.
santini
brothers
is
identical
except
there,
there
was
a
one-day
strike
before
the
employer
told
the
independent
contractors
that
he
was
not
going
to
use
their
services.
it
also--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--i
believe
it
abused
its
discretion,
and
my
final
point
on
this
would
point
that
out,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
board
has
to
order
a
make
whole
remedy
any
time
there
is
a
simple
8(e)
violation.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
believe
that
the
board
abused
its
discretion
in
not
doing
it,
and
its
stated
reasons
show
that
it
misconstrued
the
statute.
therefore,
the
denial
in
this
instance
does
not
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
the
other
reason
why
this
policy
statement
is
wrong
is,
it
allows
the
wrongdoer
to
keep
the
money.
the
victims
here,
the
independent
contractors,
did
nothing
wrong.
they
worked
now
and
grieved,
and
yet
they
had
to
pay
money
in
order
to
stay
in
business.
this
denial
of
a
make
whole
remedy
allows
the
union
to
keep
the
profit.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
in
a
solely
8(e)
case,
justice
white,
we
couldn't
find
one.
we
looked
very
hard.
we
found
some--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--that
is
what
their
sweeping
statement
says,
and
that
is
where...
i
think
my
final
point
is
that
it
provides...
that
sweeping
statement
provides
an
incentive--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--yes,
sir.
that's
true.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
i
am
saying
they
have
discretion
to
make...
to
grant
a
make
whole
remedy
in
the
appropriate
circumstances.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
i
don't
think
they
stated...
i
wish
they
had
stated
that,
but
i
don't
believe
honestly
i
could
construe
it
that
way.
they
said
that
it's
generally
overbroad
and
inappropriate.
so
they
may
have
reserved
for
some
other
time.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
no,
sir.
the
santini
brothers
case
is
almost
identical
to
this
case.
there,
the
trucking
line,
independent
contractors,
teamsters
union,
the
teamsters
approached
the
owner
of
the
trucking
line
and
said,
we
want
your
independent
contractors
to
join
the
union.
he
said,
i
am
not
going
to
make
them
join.
there
was
a
one-day
strike.
he
said,
i
understand
the
problem
now,
they
will
join
the
union.
they
did.
filed
8(e)
charges,
8(b)(4)
charges,
because
there
was
coercion,
and
in
that
context
the
board
gave
a
remedy.
so,
in
effect,
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
victim's
eyes,
the
owner-operators,
the
independent
contractors,
the
same
thing
happened
to
them.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
owner
of
the
trucking
line
had
a
one-day
strike.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir,
we
filed
8(b)(4)
charges
and
they
were
withdrawn.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
that
is
not
in
the
record.
i
can't
address
the
issue.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir,
at
the
request--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--yes,
at
the
request
of--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--actually,
i
believe
if
we
had
filed
for
a
grant...
would
be
tried
in
8(b)(4),
but
not
formally.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
and
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
correctly,
refused
to
grant
us
one.
this
denial
of
a
make
whole
remedy
also
fails
to
put
the
parties
back
in
the
position
they
were
before
the
unfair
labor
practice.
and
most
importantly,
i
think,
is,
it
provides
an
incentive
for
unions
and
employers
to
violate
the
act.
they
cannot
lose
in
this
circumstance.
they
draft
a
contract
provision
just
like
this,
and
the
owner-operator
has
to
join
the
union
to
stay
in
business.
now,
here
is
his
dilemma.
if
he
pays
the
money
and
it
turns
out
he
is
an
employee,
the
union
keeps
the
money.
if
he
wins,
he
is
not
an
employee,
he
is
an
independent
contractor.
under
the
board's
theory,
the
union
still
keeps
the
money.
it
is
a
heads
i
win,
tails
you
lose
situation.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
what
we
have,
under
section
8(e),
it
makes
it...
again,
we
filed
under
8(e).
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir,
and
the
contractor
associations
for
san
diego
and
the
union
entered
into
a
voluntary
agreement
to
cease
doing
business
with
people
under
certain
circumstances.
the
broker
here
had
joined
into
that
agreement.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
that's
true.
the
secondary
boycott
activity,
it
makes
it
over
here
secondary
boycotts,
and
it
is
a
union
unfair
labor
practice
where
they
coerce
an
employer
to
do
things.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
at
this
end
of
the
spectrum--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--we
have
an
8(e)
violation,
where
the
union
and
the
employer
agree
that
we
will
injure
the
third
party.
now,
we
think
that
the
board's
analysis
here
improperly
links
the
remedy
of
8(b)
and
8(b)(4)
as
i
was
trying
to
point
out.
here,
we
have
secondary...
coercive
secondary
activity.
it
violates
8(b)(4)
and
a
303
remedy
also
lies.
after
congress
passed
8(b)(4),
the
teamsters
union
began
negotiating
voluntary
agreements,
where
we
will
have
the
same
result,
but
we
won't
twist
your
arm.
and
this
court
in
1958
in
the
sandor
case
held
that
that
did
not
violate
the
proscriptions
of
8(b)(4).
the
next
year,
congress
amended
the
act
and
put
in
8(e)
and
made
both
of
them
unlawful
under
the
act.
they
are
both
unfair
labor
practices,
and
as
the
dissent
in
connell
points
out,
i
believe,
congress
intended
that
the
full
panoply
of
nlrb
remedies
be
available
for
this.
they
did
not
bother
to
make
it
subject
to
a
303
suit,
but
you
have
to
prove...
congress
set
up
a
scheme,
a
remedial
system
across
the
board,
handling
both
voluntary
and
coercive.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
i
do
not
at
all.
section
10(c),
the
board
cannot
grant
many
things
that
a
common
law
court
could
do.
however,
in
section
10(c),
it
stated
that
the
board
shall
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order,
and
then
gave
it
broad
discretion
to
fathom...
or
fashion
affirmative
actions
that
would
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
they
do
have
broad
discretion.
there
is
no
denying
they
have
broad
discretion.
we
think
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
if
you
look
at
it
through
the
victim's
eyes,
the
distinctions
that
they
make
that
between
section
8(e)
and
8(b)(4),
whether
you
need
actual
coercion,
they
link
8(e)
and
8(b)(4).
to
get
a
remedy
under
8(e),
a
voluntary
agreement,
which
we
have,
you
have
to
also
prove
8(b)(4).
congress
did
not
intend
that.
they
made
8(e)
an
unfair
labor
practice.
we
would
also
like
to...
the
board
in
its
decision
also
references
local
60
of
the
carpenters
union,
where
this
court
held
that
granting
a
make
whole
remedy
or
a
reimbursement
order
against
a
union
would
be
punitive.
however,
there
is
a
catch
phrase
in
it.
it
goes
on
to
say
that
reimbursement
orders
would
be
punitive
unless
there
is
evidence
that
their
membership
was
induced
or
obtained
in
violation
of
the
act.
we
maintain
that
the
petitioner's
membership
in
this
union
was
certainly
induced
or
obtained
in
violation
of
the
act,
and
that
any
make
whole
remedy
would
certainly
not
be
punitive
on
the
union.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
just
a
few
comments,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
an
ethical
problem.
the
question
that
you
posed
to
both
of
us
regarding
why
we
withdrew
the
charges,
mr.
kneedler
is
not
privy,
i
don't
believe,
to
why
the
charges
were
withdrawn.
he
has
correctly
stated
the
board's
position,
but
it
is
not
in
the
record,
and
the
reason
the
charges
were
withdrawn
are
not
before
the
court,
and
it
is
not
the
reason
that
he
was--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--he
correctly
stated
what
the
board
quite
often
does,
but
it
is
not
in
the
record
why
it
was
done
in
this
case.
justice
o'connor,
your
question
as
to
what
the
board
order
means,
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
this
case
should
be
remanded.
the
board's
reasons
is
in
a
footnote,
three
sentences,
75
words.
now,
two
years
later,
two
levels
of
appeal
later,
i
don't
know
how
many,
too
many
lawyers,
i
guess,
would
be
the
answer,
those
words
are...
we
still
don't
know
what
this
board
order
means.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
yes,
sir,
and
i
think
it
is
presently
pending
on
cert.
what
it
did
is,
it
ordered
the
board
to
make
whole
remedy
or
to
show
cause
why
it
would
not
effectuate--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
i
believe
it
is
sitting
here,
number
82-3.
it
is
up
here.
mr.
robert
f.
gore
no,
sir.
it's--
mr.
robert
f.
gore
--exactly.
there
were...
the
distinction
that
was
being
made
here
that
independent
contractors
shouldn't
get
a
remedy,
reimbursement
orders
have
been
given
to
employers.
recently
there
is
case
law
that
the
employer
may
have
to
make
whole
unions
for
excess...
for
expenses,
for
frivolous
litigation.
employees
have
certainly
gotten
reimbursement
orders.
now
all
of
a
sudden
the
policy
is
that
because
you
are
an
independent
contractor,
i
would
think
that
an
independent
contractor
could
also
be
an
employer,
but
he
can't
get
a
reimbursement
order.
i
don't
think
congress
intended
that
when
they
made
section
8(e)
an
unfair
labor
practice.
also,
there
was
a
discussion
that
the
independent
contractor
benefitted
by
this
contract.
the
law
provides
him
the
right
to
set
his
own
contract.
he
did
get
some
benefits,
but
he
was
compelled
both
to
take
the
benefits
and
the
burdens.
he
had
to
pay
initiation
fees,
dues.
he
was
subject
to
union
discipline,
had
a
dispute
broken
out.
and
so
i
think
the
benefits
argument
has
been
rejected
in
many
instances,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
a
good
argument
that
they
are
making.
the
primary
purpose
of
this
act
is
to
protect
the
public
interest
and
the
policies
of
the
act
by
mitigating
the
effects
of
that
violation
and
preventing
future
violation.
the
board's
order
does
not
accomplish
either
of
these
functions,
nor
does
the
board's
terse
statement
of
its
reasons
for
denying
a
make
whole
remedy
survive
close
analysis.
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
board
for
further
proceedings.
thank
you.
