justice
byron

white
at
least
you
have
to
prove
coercion.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
the
board
has
issued
a
make
whole
remedy
in
an
8(e)
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
for
all
practical
purposes
they
have
a
per
se
rule
that
in
8(e)
cases
you
don't
make
whole,
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
they
should
have
discretion,
and
they
say
they
have
none.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
say
they
haven't
any.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
never
found
a
case
where
they
have
granted
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
you...
did
you
initially
file
8(b)(4)
charges,
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
you
withdraw
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right,
but
anyway,
you
withdrew
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
became
just
purely
an
8(e)
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
the
alj,
you
say,
found
what
would
be
necessary
to
be
an
8(b)(4).
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you,
for
an
8(b)(4),
the
coercion
that
is
required
is
coercing
the
employer
not
to
do
business,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
kind
of
coercion
you
are
talking
about.
here,
the
kind
of
coercion
you
say
the
alj
found
and
that
was
proved,
you
think,
is
coercion
on
the
independent
operators
to
join
the
union.
that
is
a
different
kettle
of
fish,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a...
8(e)
is
a
voluntary
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
could
still
then...
there
could
still
be
coercion
on
the
independent
operators
to
join
the
union.
you
say
if
you
don't...
we
have
agreed
that
unless
you
join
the
union,
you
are
out
of
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
could
say,
that
is
coercion,
but
that
wouldn't
make
it...
that
wouldn't...
coercion
on
them
wouldn't
make
it
an
8(b)(4).
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
this
is
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
different
coercion.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
board
rely
on...
or
did
it?
did
i
misunderstand?
didn't
the
board
in
part
rely
on
the
availability
of
a
303
action
for
its
refusal
to
make
whole,
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
is
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
you
draw
the
difference
between...
the
person
against
whom
the
secondary
pressure
is
applied
is
these
owner-operators.
now,
if
the...
you
think
they
should
get...
be
made
whole,
and
should
be
able
to
recover
if
the
union
pressured
the
employer
into
not
doing
business
with
them,
or
if
they
pressured
them
to
sign
the
8(e),
or
to
live
up
to
it,
i
take
it.
then
you
would
say
that
is
an
8(b)(4).
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
however,
in
this
case,
you
say
because
it
is
only
an
8(e)
violation,
namely,
no
pressure
on
the
employer,
the
owner-operators
who
would
be
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
if
the
employer
was
pressured,
they
have
suffered
the
same
injury,
shouldn't
have
the
same
remedy
that
they
would
have
had
if
the
employer
had
been
pressured.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
both
the
employer
and
the
union
want
to
damage
these
people
together,
and
they
both
agree
to
it,
there
is
no
injury,
but
if
only
the
union
wants
to
damage
him
and
pressures
the
employer
into
it,
there
is
injury,
there
is
a
compensable
injury?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
the
board
do,
or
do
you
know,
in
an
8(b)(4)...
suppose
the
owner-operators
here
had
filed
an
8(b)(4)
and
proved
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
had
been
adjudicated,
an
8(b)(4)
violation.
could
the
board
have
made
them
whole?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
generally
they
do
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
monetary
relief.
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
did
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
remand
the
case
to
the
board?
is
that
the
joint
council
of
teamsters
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
8(e).
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
board...
what
action
did
the
board
take?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
see.
i
see.
it
has
never
gone
back
on
remand.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
board
has
never
had
a
chance
to
give
more
than
three
lines.
