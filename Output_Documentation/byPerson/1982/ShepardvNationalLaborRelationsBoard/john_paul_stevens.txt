before
you
leave
the
second,
i
am
just
a
little
bit
unsure
about
one
part
of
it.
are
you
saying
that
there
was
coercion,
or
there
was
causal
connection
between
what
the
union
did
and
the
harm
to
your
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
are
saying
there
was
coercion,
then
also
there
would
have
been
a
303
remedy,
wouldn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
303.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
are
saying
a
fair
reading
of
the
alj's
findings
are
that
you
have
proved...
that
has
been
proved.
