mr.
carroll
r.
graham
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
national
banking
act
of
1864
authorized
the
tax
in
question,
and
that
point
was
litigated
in
1866
very
thoroughly
in
van
ness
versus
the
assessors.
van
ness
points
out
that
there
were
two
bases
for
the
application
of
the
tax,
two
prongs
for
it:
number
one,
congress
said
that
you
could
tax
the
shares
of
national
banks;
and
number
two,
there
was
no
limitation
to
exclude
any
part
of
the
value
of
the
shares.
and
van
ness
versus
the
assessors,
1866,
held
that,
number
one,
you
could
tax
the
shares
of
national
banks;
and
number
two,
you
did
not
have
to
deduct
the
value
of
the
federal
obligations
owned
by
the
bank.
this
situation
remained
throughout
the
years
and
every
case
which
came
to
this
court
prior
to
'59
upheld
the
true
share
tax,
but
did
not
uphold
the
taxes
where
they
tried
to
levy
on
the
bank
itself
rather
than
the
shareholders.
that
problem
does
not
exist
with
the
texas
statute,
as
it
clearly
levies
the
tax
on
the
shareholders,
and
there
is
no
legal
obligation
upon
the
bank
to
pay
any
part
of
the
share
tax.
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
yes.
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
no.
no,
i
sure
don't.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
draw
is
that
in
1959
for
95
years...
for
93
years
it
had
been
settled
law
that
national
banks
and
state
banks
could
be
taxed
on
their
shares,
and
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
deduct
the
value
of
federal
obligations,
because
under
the
van
ness
holding
when
congress
authorized
the
taxing
of
the
shares
it
authorized
the
taxing
of
the
full
value
of
the
shares.
and
that
position
existed
in
1959
and,
we
respectfully
submit,
was
not
changed
at
all.
number
one,
it
was
not
changed
because
that
law
was
not
touched.
that
was
revised
statute
5219.
it
was
on
the
books
all
during
those
years.
it
was
on
the
books
in
1959.
it
was
not
touched
by
congress
in
any
manner.
it's
our
position
that
the
modification
or
the
codification
of
the
exemption
statute,
3701,
did
not
in
any
way
apply
to
or
control
or
reflect
upon
the
taxation
of
the
national
bank
shares.
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
no,
sir.
in
1959,
after
the
modification
of
3701
with
the
addition
of
the
second
sentence,
the
bank
act
still
provided
for
taxation
of
bank
shares
in
the
same
manner
in
which
they're
being
taxed
today,
the
same
provision
that
the
shares
could
be
taxed,
and
there's
never
been
any
modification
by
the
congress
of
the
definition
of
"shares"
or
in
any
manner
changed
the
definition
that
was
laid
down
in
van
ness.
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
the
gift
tax--
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
--idaho
would
have
been
invalid
before.
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
i
don't
know.
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
but
the
congressional
record
said
they
probably
wouldn't
have
prevailed,
but
they
wanted
to--
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
--or
that
that
particular
type
of
tax
was
not
going
to
be
tried
by
anyone
else.
in
1959,
shortly
before
3701
was
modified,
congress
did
amend
the
national
banking
laws,
but
it
did
not
change
the
provision
in
question
whatsoever.
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
the
general
motors,
the
question
of
the
general
motors
stock,
the
applicability
there
is
a
different
question,
mr.
justice,
because
i
know
of
no
statute
which
authorizes
the
taxation
of
those
shares
specifically.
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
i
do
not
take
a
position
on
other
corporations,
because
i
do
not--
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
--correct.
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
correct,
sir,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
number
one,
if
you
go
look
at
the
committee
reports,
they
talk
about
idaho,
they
talk
about
interest,
they
talk
about
debt
management.
they
don't
ever
mention
a
word
about
bank
stock
and
taxation.
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
on
this
point,
on
the
federal
obligation
point?
without
excluding
the
federal
obligations?
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
that
may
well
be
true,
yes,
sir.
banks
are
different.
banks
pay
different
taxes.
banks
do
not
pay
personal
property
taxes.
banks
do
not
pay
franchise
taxes.
and
we
have
a
particular
statute
dealing
with
the
taxation
of
national
banks.
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
oh,
taxation...
if
we're
staying
on
the
proposition
of
federal
obligation,
yes,
sir.
mr.
carroll
r.
graham
that's
right,
because
the
congress
has
provided
that,
and
for
a
long
time
set
out
the
precise
methods
by
which
those
taxes,
the
tax
methods
that
had
to
be
followed.
that
has
now
been
changed
in
1969
and
remedied...
or,
i
shouldn't
say
remedied,
but
expanded.
when
we
come
back
to
the
point
of
the
implied
repeal
which
i
take
it
the
petitioners
must
rest
upon,
we
have
a
number
of
statutory
construction
aids
which
we
refer
to
in
our
briefs,
consistently
i
hope,
and
all
of
them
will
point
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
intention
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
repeal
the
authority
given
in
the
bank
act
to
tax
the
national
banks
without
deduction
of
any
obligations
whatsoever.
the
question
of
indirect
taxation
was
prohibited
before
1959
and
if
you
will
look...
and
we
cite
the
case
of
society
of
savings
versus
bowers,
in
which
justice
harlan
points
out
that
indirect
is
prohibited
with
the
exception
of
the
bank
stock
tax.
in
1969,
coming
again
to
an
argument
against
an
implied
repeal,
in
1969
congress
amended
the
bank
stock
tax
and
enlarged
the...
changed
the
method
of
taxation
and
directed
the
federal
reserve
to
carry
out
a
study.
and
during
that
time
in
'69
the
federal
reserve
carried
out
a
study
and
that
study
recognized
that
the
bank
share
tax
without
any
necessity
for
deducting
federal
obligations
was,
at
least
in
the
opinion
of
the
people
who
made
that
study,
still
in
full
force
and
effect.
thank
you.
