mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
state
property
tax
on
the
shares
of
state
and
national
banks,
authorized
by
texas
statute
but
imposed
and
calculated
by
local
taxing
authorities.
in
the
case
before
the
court
the
banks
have
paid
the
taxes
as
agents
for
the
shareholders
and
they
and
the
shareholders
seek
to
have
the
tax
assessment
declared
to
be
in
violation
of
revised
statutes
section
3701
as
amended
in
1959
to
prohibit
every
form
of
taxation
that
considers
united
states
obligations
in
the
computation
of
the
tax.
the
respondents
calculated
the
taxable
value
of
the
shares
of
each
bank
according
to
the
bank's
net
worth.
that
is,
as
the
court
below
put
it
at
appendix
page
183,
by
taking
the
total
assets
of
the
bank
other
than
real
estate,
which
is
taxed
separately
to
the
bank
itself,
and
deducting
the
bank's
liabilities,
to
come
up
with
a
net
worth
or
equity
capital
or
a
number
of
names
as
it's
known
on
call
statements,
financial
statements
or
the
taxing
authorities,
but
in
an
accounting
sense
it
is
the
net
worth,
the
assets
less
the
liabilities
other
than
real
estate.
now,
among
those
assets
were
various
amounts
of
united
states
obligations
that
went
into
that
net
worth
that
was
used
to
determine
the
taxable
value
of
the
shares.
petitioners
contend
that
respondents
thereby
3701.
thus,
at
the
center
of
the
case
is
the
effect
of
the
word
"considered"
as
used
in
that
statute.
the
word
is
given
no
special
definition
in
the
statute.
now,
of
course
the
word
"consider"
can
be
used
in
two
senses:
one,
which
is
the
sense
relied
on
by
respondents,
and
they
repeatedly
refer
to
the
state
of
mind
of
the
tax
assessors,
refers
to
a
subjective
state
or
a
mental
process
inside
the
mind.
"in
my
considered
judgment"
or
"this
court
considers
a
case
for
decision.
"
but
that
sense
of
the
word
cannot
be
involved
here
because
the
word
as
used
in
the
statute
is
addressed
to
and
defines
a
prohibited
form
of
taxation,
which
is
incapable
of
a
mental
process.
another
sense
of
the
word
"considers"
deals
with
an
objective
state
of
facts,
which
the
statute
itself
purports
to
do,
as
reflected
in
the
dictionary
definition
of
"to
take
into
account".
the
general
law
of
relativity
considers
the
effect
of
gravity
on
light
or
takes
into
account
the
effect
of
gravity.
this
is
the
meaning
that
makes
sense
in
the
context
of
section
3701,
so
that,
substituting
the
dictionary
objective
meaning,
the
statute
prohibits
every
form
of
taxation
that
takes
into
account
united
states
obligations
in
the
computation
of
the
tax.
and
this
is
the
sense
in
which
this
court
and
the
texas
courts
and
other
authorities
have
described
the
computation
of
a
share
tax
measured
by
net
assets
that
included
united
states
obligations.
for
example,
in
des
moines
national
bank
against
fairweather,
cited
in
our
brief,
this
court
was
dealing
with
a
share
tax
that
was
computed
just
exactly
like
the
one
at
bar.
that
is,
assets,
which
included
united
states
obligations,
less
liabilities
resulted
in
a
net
worth
that
was
the
basis,
the
base
for
the
tax.
at
that
time
section
3701
was
in
the
form
before
the
1959
amendment
and
only
prohibited
taxes
upon
united
states
obligations
and
not
those
which
considered
united
states
obligations,
and
the
court
upheld
the
tax
without
a
deduction
for
united
states
obligations
on
the
familiar
distinction
that
a
tax
upon
a
shareholder's
interest
is
not
a
tax
upon
the
corporation
or
the
corporation's
assets,
even
though,
as
this
court
said
in
describing
the
tax
there,
"controlling
consideration"
is
given
to
those
assets
in
the
computation
of
the
tax.
the
court
in
its
holding
said
section
3701
left
no
authority
for
taxing
a
united
states
obligation
to
the
bank,
to
the
bank
itself,
"but
only
for
taking
it
into
account
in
valuing
the
shares
of
the
stockholders.
"
so
that
this
court
in
its
description
of
this
very
kind
of
tax
recognized
that
the
tax
considers
united
states
obligations,
takes
them
into
account,
but
under
the
former
form
of
the
statute
that
was
permissible
because
the
tax
was
only
upon
united
states
obligations,
whereas
since
the
1959
amendment
taxes
are
prohibited,
every
form
of
tax
that
considers
those
obligations.
we
cite
in
our
brief
at
page
14
texas
authorities
that
have
used
similar
language
and
a
similar
approach
in
describing
the
very
share
tax
that's
before
this
court.
the
assessment
in
the
present
cases
take
into
account
the
bank's
assets
which
include
united
states
obligations
and
therefore
come
squarely
under
the
statutory
prohibition
against
considering
united
states
obligations
in
the
computation
of
the
tax.
respondents,
however,
would
read
an
implied
exception
into
the
prohibition
of
the
statute
in
spite
of
its
apparent
application.
but
any
implied
exceptions
are
foreclosed
by
two
specific
exemptions
that
the
1959
amendment
itself
provided
from
its
expanded
prohibition.
under
the
pre-1959
version
of
section
3701,
when
only
taxes
upon
united
states
obligations
were
prohibited,
this
court
had
upheld
share
taxes,
as
in
des
moines
against
fairweather
and
other
cases,
and
it
had
upheld
franchise
taxes,
and
it
had
upheld
death
taxes
or
succession
taxes,
where
the
tax
was
measured
by
assets
that
included
united
states
obligations.
and
in
each
of
those
cases,
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
cross-refer
to
one
another...
the
francise
tax
case
refers
to
the
share
tax
case,
and
so
forth...
in
each
of
those
cases
the
tax
was
upheld
because
it
was
not
upon
united
states
obligations
by
which
the
tax
was
measured,
but
rather
upon
the
shareholders'
interest
or
the
franchise
or
the
death
transfer.
now,
when
section
3701
was
amended
by
congress
in
1959
into
its
present
form,
on
which
petitioners
rely
and
which
is
before
this
court,
congress
specifically
excepted
franchise
taxes
and
specifically
excepted
death
taxes
from
the
expanded
prohibition
of
the
tax.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
gift
taxes
are
not
mentioned,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
certainly
in
the
view
of
the
solicitor
general
that's
so.
no
gifts
are
involved
in
the
case
before
the
court.
but
it
would
appear
that,
not
being
excepted
from
the
statute,
that
they
would
be
covered.
now,
having
made
no
exception
for
any
kind
of
property
tax,
share
taxes
or
otherwise,
but
having
excepted
franchise
taxes
and
death
taxes,
it
would
be
quite
unwarranted
to
infer
an
exception
or
imply
an
exception,
as
respondents
would
do,
for
share
taxes.
respondents'
several
arguments
end
with
section
3701
having
no
substantive
effect,
at
least
as
to
banks.
but
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
plain
and
its
prohibition
is
clear,
irrespective
of
who
owns
the
exempt
obligations.
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
if
i
may
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
point
out
in
response
to
respondent's
argument
concerning
the
idaho
case
that
had
congress
intended
solely
to
deal
with
the
problem
raised
by
the
idaho
case
it
could
have
taken
the
then-existing
form
of
section
3701
and
added
four
words.
after
the
words
"united
states
obligations"
it
could
have
added
"or
the
interest
thereon"
were
it
addressing
only
the
idaho
problem.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
the
tax
in
the
case
at
bar,
your
honor?
yes,
i
certainly
do.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
it
had
the
effect
of
overturning
the
results
of
those
cases.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
those
cases
stood,
beginning
with
the
van
allen
case
in
1866
and
ending
with
the
bowers
case
in
1955,
those
cases
rested
not
on
an
interpretation
of
section
5219,
but
on
the
shareholder-corporation
distinction.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
now,
under
that
distinction--
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
--excuse
me,
justice.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
well,
i
think
that
it
goes--
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
--it
overturns
the
result
of
the
cases
by--
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
--providing
a
different
test.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
that
theory
was
germane
only,
justice
white,
to
a
prohibition
against
a
tax
upon
united
states
obligations.
that
distinction
is
not
germane
any
more.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
exactly.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
well,
it
did
evoke
some
comment,
justice
stevens.
the
comment
on
the
whole
subject
that
we're
talking
about,
including
this
idaho
question
or--
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
--exactly.
there
is
a
great--
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
--well,
the
words
of
the
statute--
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
--and
they
did
make
that,
those
words,
those
52
words
of
the
statute,
not
four
words
to
deal
with
an
idaho
problem...
they
put
the
52
words
of
the
statute
into
the
act
in
furtherance
of
a
stated
purpose,
which
was
stated
by
the
congress
and
the
congressional
committee,
to
make
united
states
obligations
more
attractive
as
investments,
and
indeed
to
encourage
banks
to
hold
them.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
i
can't
answer
the
question,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
was
debated
on
the
floor
because
there
were
some
remarks
of
congressman
mills
mentioned.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
s.
sloman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
to
the
banks.
