mr.
ernest
j.
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
it
it
please
the
court:
i
should
like,
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
to
refer
the
court
particularly
to
the
circumstances,
the
background
leading
to
the
1959
amendment,
which
is
of
course
central
here.
i
think
that
in
light
of
those
circumstances
one
can
conclude,
in
the
terms
used
just
two
months
ago
in
the
memphis
bank
opinion,
that
it
can
be
determined
that
this
statute
is
another
manifestation
of
what
the
court
called
the
long-established
congressional
intent
to
prevent
taxes
which
diminish
in
the
slightest
degree
the
market
value
or
the
investment
attractiveness
of
obligations
of
the
united
states.
the
legislation
resulted
from
a
presidential
message,
supported
by
an
appearance
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
before
the
ways
and
means
committee,
seeking
what
both
called
assistance
in
the
management
of
the
national
debt,
assistance
by
lifting
the
debt
ceiling,
by
raising
the
interest
ceiling,
or
i
should
say
removing
the
interest
ceiling,
which
was
then
3.26
percent
on
savings
bonds
and...
the
figure
seems
strange
to
us
today...
4.25
percent
on
obligations
of
a
maturity
of
more
than
five
years.
the
secretary
told
the
committee
that
the
treasury
was
unable
to
market
4.25
percent
bonds
and
so
was
necessarily
financing
the
government
on
very
short-term
obligations
and
treasury
bills.
also
asked
was
what
both
the
president
and
the
secretary
referred
to
as
other
technical
assistance,
and
that
of
course
is
what
is
referred
to
here
in
the
exemption,
or
the
further
exemption
or
to
clarify
the
exemption,
of
national
obligations,
government
bonds.
the
congress
did
lift
the
debt
ceiling.
it
did
increase
the
savings
bond
ceiling.
but
it
did
not,
after
extended
discussion
of
interest
rates,
whether
they
were
inflationary
or
not...
some
of
them
have
echoes
even
today,
of
whether
higher
interest
causes
inflation
or
inflation
causes
higher
interest...
but
it
did
not.
so
it
was
the
more
important
that
the
impact
of
state
taxes
on
the
federal
bonds
be
carefully
observed.
both
the
president
and
the
secretary
informed
the
congress
that
the
state
obligations
had
a
very
highly
preferential
position.
federal
taxes
were
high
then,
as
some
think
them
now,
and
the
state
exemption
made
them
very
attractive,
highly
marketable.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
secretary
informed
the
committee
that
state
obligations
in
the
12
postwar
years
had
increased
from
$16
billion
to
$59
billion,
which
led
to
strenuous
competition
for
the
federal
obligations
in
the
market.
the
secretary
used
as
an
illustration
to
the
committee
an
idaho
tax
which
was
in
force
seeking
to
reach
interest
on
government
bonds.
the
justification
was
the
tax
was
on
the
individual,
measured
by
the
interest
on
the
bonds.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
the
dividends
distributed
by
the
corporation--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
--no,
justice
stevens.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
well,
it
hasn't
been
thus
far.
the
regulations
under
section
312
of
the
internal
revenue
code
say
that
it
doesn't
carry
over.
i
may
quote
justice
holmes
in
miller
and
milwaukee
saying
that
the
corporation
is
usually
an
insulator
which
separates
the
nature
of
the
corporate
income.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
well,
no...
yes,
after
the
statute
i
am
arguing
that
it's
not.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
make
that
classification
if
it's
not
essential
here.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
i
think
what's
central
here
is
not
the
insulation,
but
the
use
of
the
"or
measured
by"
device,
which
has
been
frequently
used
in
taxes,
sometimes
with
unpredictable
results.
justice
harlan...
the
idaho
case
was
used
as
an
example,
but
perhaps
a
better
example
would
have
been
the
case
decided
by
this
court
just
four
years
before,
the
cleveland
case,
society
for
savings,
where
the
tax
on
financial
institutions
was
on
their
capital
and
surplus.
but
the
ohio
court
said,
though
this
was
a
mutual
savings
bank,
that
the
tax
was
on
the
interest
of
the
depositors,
measured
by
the
assets
of
the
bank.
this
court
did
not
agree.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
that
at
times
it
was
very
hard
to
distinguish
for
practical
purposes,
justice
stevens,
the
difference
between
a
tax
on
the
assets
and
a
tax
on
the
shares
when
the
tax
on
the
shares
was
"computed
by".
so
this
"measured
by"
device
which
didn't
succeed
there
sometimes
does.
it's
hard
to
predict.
i
might
mention
that
just
six
months
before
this
statute
this
court
held
that
a
virginia
tax
on
the
assets,
what
purported
to
be
a
property
tax,
could
be
measured
by
gross
receipts,
though
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
a
separate
opinion
that
if
it
were
measured
by
the
property
it
would
come
to
$7,000;
on
gross
receipts
it
came
to
$126,000.
in
any
event,
the
treasury
in
this
case
thought
it
would
do
away
with
this
"measured
by"
device.
so
it--
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
--yes,
i
do,
i
do.
mr.
ernest
j.
brown
yes,
i
feel
that's
clear.
some
people
thought
maybe
the
earlier
statement
was
more
universal
than
its
application
warranted,
and
they
may
have
referred
to
clarification.
but
that
would
hardly
be
justified
when
you
looked
at
the
decisions.
so
this
statute
then,
i
take
it,
eliminates
any
computation,
and
in
my
view
the
word
"computation"
is
the
operative
word
here,
which
takes
into
account,
reaches
directly
or
indirectly
the
bonds
of
the
federal
government
or
the
income
from
those
bonds.
and
it
is
clear
that
in
this
case
the
computation,
as
in
the
georgia
case
which
is
pending,
did
include
those
bonds.
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly,
if
i
may,
also
to
one
other
federal
statute
much
relied
on
below,
rev.
stat.
5219,
a
later
version,
which
is
relied
on
as
saying
there
could
be
taxes
on
these
shares.
well,
no
one
disputes
that
the
shares
could
be
taxed.
this
court
said
so
in
mcculloch
and
maryland.
the
national
bank
act
said
nothing
in
this
statute
shall
prohibit
it.
what
is
objected
to
here
is
the
method,
and
certainly
that
is
subject
to
objection.
if
i
may
take
the
memphis
case,
in
this
context
suppose
this
property
tax
had
included
the
federal
bonds
but
excluded
the
state
bonds.
i
take
it
that
the
share
tax
would
have
been
as
discriminatory
there
on
the
property,
on
the
share,
as
it
was
held,
a
somewhat
different
tax,
was
held
to
be
discriminatory
two
months
ago
in
the
memphis
case.
so
i
think
that
5219
has
no
bearing
on
this
case
at
all.
it
is
certainly
not
carte
blanche
to
tax
the
shares
of
a
bank
or
any
other
corporation
which
is
equally
involved
in
this
case,
may
be
equally
involved
in
this
case,
in
any
fashion
that
is
desired.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
quite
clear,
and
the
background
in
congress
makes
it
clear,
that
this
statute
meant
to
eliminate
computation
of
estate
tax,
any
form
of
tax,
which
directly
or
indirectly
used
the
value
or
the
income
from
government
obligations.
and
that's
all
this
case
is.
thank
you.
