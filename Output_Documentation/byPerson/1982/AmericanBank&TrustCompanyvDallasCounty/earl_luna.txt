mr.
earl
luna
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
recently
recognized
in
the
tennessee
case
the
fact
that
the
statute
that
we
have
here
today,
31
742,
principally
restates
the
constitutional
rule
that
we
have
had
since
mcculloch
versus
maryland.
and
in
that
memphis
bank
case
the
court
pointed
out
very
clearly
that
where
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
falls
on
the
separate
property
interest
of
the
stockholder
or
some
other
person
other
than
the
government
or
the
owner
of
the
bonds
itself,
that
unless
there
is
a
discrimination
between
the
national...
the
taxation
as
to
the
federal
securities
and
others,
that
it
didn't
violate
31
u.s.c.
742.
now,
there
is
no
contention
in
this
case
as
it
is
before
the
court
at
this
time
that
there
is
any
discrimination
on
federal
securities
versus
any
other
type
securities,
such
as
there
was
in
the
tennessee
case.
now,
if
that
is
true,
the
constitutional
provision...
that
statutory
provision,
as
late
as
the
memphis
case
the
court
has
said
it
does
not
affect
this
kind
of
a
transaction.
now,
i
think
that
takes
us,
if
we
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
two
questions
or
the
two
reasons
that
were
raised
actually
in
the
van
allen
case,
the
court
in
texas,
our
chief
justice
guittard,
i
think
pointed
out
very
carefully
that
there
were
two
grounds
that
were
mentioned
in
the
van
allen
case,
either
one
of
which
were
sufficient
to
sustain
our
tax.
now,
the
court
pointed
out
first
that
there
was
a
distinction
between
taxation
of
the
shares
and
taxation
of
bank
assets,
and
i
think
that
is
this
insulation
that
we
were
talking
about
earlier.
there
is
an
insulation
between
the
corporation's
assets
and
the
stockholders.
the
legal
incidence
is
on
the
stockholder
and
not
the
corporation.
the
second
reason
that
was
mentioned
in
the
van
allen
case
which
made
it
permissible
to
tax
bank
shares
was
a
congressional
consent
to
state
taxation
of
bank
shares
as
expressed
in
section
5219.
5219
has
never
been
altered
or
changed,
although
it
was
expanded
ten
years
after
the
'59
amendment
that
didn't
allow.
in
1969
the
congress
expanded
that
amendment
to
include
more
general
areas
than
it
did
before.
but
in
our
case,
if
then
we
take
a
look
at
the
question
we
were
talking
about
a
while
ago,
the
taxation
of
federal
securities,
i
think
if
the
tax
the
legal
incident
of
which
falls
on
these
federal
securities,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
who
it
is,
we
cannot
tax
them.
that's
been
very
clear,
and
the
cases
have
pointed
out
that
we
can't
do
it
directly
or
indirectly,
and
they
said
that
before
31
u.s.c.
742
was
amended.
all
of
these
cases
have
said
that
they
can't
be
taxed
directly
or
indirectly.
but
at
the
same
time
that
the
courts
were
saying
they
can't
be
taxed
directly
or
indirectly,
the
court
also
said
that
a
tax
on
the
stockholder
is
not
a
tax
on
a
bank.
now,
at
some
stages
of
this
litigation
the
banks
have
said,
but
we
paid
the
tax
actually,
and
of
course
the
reason
they
did
that
is
because
of
another
federal
statute
that
permits
them
to
pay
the
tax
for
the
stockholder
and
that
the
bank
can
deduct
it
if
the
stockholder
doesn't
deduct
it
himself,
which
really
makes
it
not
material
at
all
to
the
questions
that
we
have
here.
now,
we
believe
then
that
if
we
were
to
follow
the
view
that
the
banks
have
propounded
here
today,
that
it
would
indeed
mean
that
any
corporation
which
owns
federal
securities,
you
would
have
to
subtract
that
stock
or
those
bonds
and
federal
securities
from
the
value
of
the
stock
before
you
could
tax
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
one
of
the
footnotes
in
our
brief
we
point
out
that
there
are
about
20-something
states
who
tax
either
corporate
stock
in
corporations
generally
or
bank
stock
or
both.
now,
in
texas
that
question
is
not
material
because
we
do
not
tax
the
corporate
stock
in
other
types
of
corporations,
only
banks.
but
as
this
court
mentioned
in
one
of
its
opinions,
if
that
should
be...
if
we
should
have
to
deduct
it
in
all
cases,
it
would
be
nothing
but
chaos
in
the
taxing
systems
of
the
various
states.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
31
u.s.c.
742
as
amended
in
1959
to
require
or
suggest
that
it
applies
to
ad
valorem
taxation
if
we
can
rely
to
any
extent
on
the
congressional
history.
secretary
anderson
introduced
section
105
of
that
bill
and
in
his
introduction
to
the
ways
and
means
committee
of
the
bill
he
pointed
out
very
carefully
that
indeed
idaho
had
attempted
to
tax
the
income
from
federal
securities
and
they
had
not
been
able
to
convince
them
it
wasn't
taxable
and
idaho
was
including
it
in
the
net
income.
and
he
pointed
out
in
his
statement,
which
we
quote
at
length
in
our
brief,
that
it
was...
that
they
believed
that
idaho
was
wrong,
but
that
this
seemed
to
be
the
easiest
way
to
clarify
the
problem,
and
therefore
he
recommended
that
congress
pass
105,
section
105
of
that
bill,
in
order
to
clarify
the
situation
that
they
had
as
to
idaho.
and
that
was
the
only
thing
that
we
had
before
the
congress
at
that
time
insofar
as
reasons
as
to
why
that
statute
ought
to
be
amended
in
that
particular.
now,
the
petitioners
say
that
we
shouldn't
take
into
consideration
in
thinking
about
statutes
anything
subjective,
that
it's
all
objective.
now,
unless
we
look
at
it
subjective
we
don't
get
to
the
question
here,
because
our
state
statute
simply
says
that
the
value
of
stock,
the
bank
stock,
shall
be
assessed
at
its
cash
value
less
the
value
of
the
real
estate
which
may
be
taxed
separately.
so
our
statute
just
talks
about
cash
value.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
things
we
have
here.
now,
as
a
measuring
stick
of
cash
value
we
might
use
several
things.
in
the
bank
of
texas
case
where
this
decision
was
written,
had
we
used
cash
value
that
they
were
getting
when
they
were
selling
the
stock
down
at
the
bank,
the
testimony
showed
it
was
bringing
nine
dollars
a
share.
and
the
measuring
stick
that
we
used
was
$5.65
a
share.
so
they're
really
arguing
about
our
formula,
not
that
we
taxed
the
bank
too
high,
the
stock
too
high.
so
they
say,
if
they
use
our
formula,
which
was
based
on
equity
capital
and
not
on
what
it
was
selling
for
at
the
marketplace,
they
wound
up
paying
less
tax
than
they
would
otherwise
have
paid.
are
they
injured?
is
there
harm?
and
when
one
is
challenging
a
statute,
doesn't
he
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
there
has
been
some
harm?
certainly
that
has
not
been
shown
in
this
case.
the
only
thing
that
has
been
shown
is
that
by
using
the
formula
with
which
they
argue
the
banks
got
a
windfall.
mr.
earl
luna
if
section
5719
would
have
never
been
on
the
books,
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument,
because
we
believe
van
allen
stands
for
two
propositions
which
permit
bank
stock
to
be
taxable:
one,
because
of
the
separate
ownership
of
the
stock
and
the
corporation;
and
then
number
two,
the
consent
statute,
5219
itself,
either
one
of
which--
mr.
earl
luna
--i
don't
believe
it
had
one
iota
on
van
allen,
because
i
cannot
believe
that
in
all
of
the
hearings
of
congress
they
would
have
overruled
almost
100
years
of
cases
of
this
court
and
never
told
anybody
that's
what
they
were
doing.
that's
just
not
the
way
congress
ordinarily
works.
and
they
said
that,
instead
of
talking
about
the
decisions
of
this
court,
while
the
congressional
history
was
going
on
they
said
that,
we're
doing
it
in
order
to
clarify
the
problem
that
we've
got
up
in
idaho,
and
that
is
the
only
thing
that
there
is
in
the
congressional
history.
and
it
would
be
indeed
unusual
if
congress
were
to
overrule
that
many
cases
of
this
court
and
not
a
word
ever
be
said
about
what
was
going
on.
in
plummer
versus
coler
the
court,
this
court,
had
also
pointed
out
in
inheritance
tax
cases
that
there
really
was
no
impact
on
the
market
in
the
first
place,
on
the
market
of
bonds.
i
mention
that
very
quickly
because
of
one
of
the
arguments
that
was
made
by,
i
believe
it
was
the
solicitor
general,
that
there
was
an
impact
on
the
market.
now
here
the
non-banking
world
owned
77
percent
of
all
of
these,
of
all
of
united
states
securities.
of
the
23
percent
that
is
owned
by
the
banks,
there's
only
about
five
percent
of
the
total
that
is
owned
by
the
banks
in
the
six
states
or
seven
states
that
tax
bank
shares,
six
now
since
georgia
just
recently
repealed
theirs.
and
the
only
case,
of
course,
that
they
have
in
their
favor
is
the
montana
case,
and
the
montana
case...
and
as
they
argue
here,
this
permits
bank
share
case...
it
prohibits
the
bank
share
taxation,
but
permits
the
franchise
tax.
and
of
course
as
we
know,
montana
just
recently
ruled
that
their
franchise
tax
is
unconstitutional,
too.
we
believe
that,
as
the
texas
court
held,
the
montana
case
is
not
reliable,
and
732
was
something
that
was
aimed
at
the
idaho
income
tax,
that
it
has
absolutely
no
effect
on
the
tax
that's
before
the
court
at
this
time.
thank
you
very
much.
