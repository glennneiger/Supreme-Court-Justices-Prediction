mr.
brown,
let
me
interrupt
you
right
there,
because
that
idaho
example
raised
a
question
in
my
mind.
supposing
you
had
a
corporation
that
was
subjected
to
a
state
income
tax
and
some
of
its
income
was
derived
from
income
on
government
bonds.
would
the
dividend
income
of
that
corporation
be
exempt
from
tax
to
the
extent
that
it
reflected
interest
on
government
bonds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
the
shareholders,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
that
be
indirectly
a
tax
on
income,
just
as
the
tax
on
value
of
the
shares
is
a
tax
on
the
underlying
government
bond?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
this
case
you're
arguing
the
corporation
is
not
an
insulator.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
it's
an
insulator
for
income
purposes,
but
not
for
asset
purposes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
graham,
is
it
not
true
that
your
opponent's
theory
is
not
limited
to
extending
the
exemption
on
bank
stock,
but
it
covers
all
kinds
of
corporations
under
their
reading
of
the
'59
act?
as
i
understand,
it
would
cover
general
motors
stock,
every
kind
of
stock
that
there
is
in
the
economy.
so
that
you
wouldn't
expect
it
to
focus
on
bank
shares.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
a
state
sought
to
impose
some
kind
of
a
tax
on
any
corporate
entity
measured
by
its
net
worth,
under
the
government's
view
they
would
have
to
exclude
from
the
computation
that
portion
that
represented
federal
obligations.
so
they're
not
just
talking
about
banks.
they
say
this
is
really
a
pretty
broad
exemption
they
created
in
'59.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
why
you're
afraid
to.
it
seems
to
me
it
would
support
your
position.
you
say
there
wasn't...
you
say
at
least,
however
broad
it
was,
it
didn't
repeal,
didn't
effect
an
implied
repeal
of
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--isn't
it
true
that
your
view
of
'59
is
it
really
destroys
that
distinction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
for
this
kind
of
tax?
well,
it
has
to
go
that
far
or
it
wouldn't
have
overturned
the
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
he
makes
that
making
that
significant
a
change
in
the
law,
where
you
had
90-some
years
of
settled
rule,
would
have
invoked
some
comment
in
the
legislative
deliberations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
really
says
nothing
about
the
differences
between
a
corporation--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
really
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
tell
the
congressmen
who
weren't
as
sophisticated
in
this
area
as
lawyers
who
practice
all
the
time
just
what
was
happening.
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
they
just
read
into
the
words
of
the
statute
the
"indirectly"
language
and
the
computation
and
the
concern
language.
