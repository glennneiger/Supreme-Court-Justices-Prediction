justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
prior
to
'59
the
tax
would
unquestionably
have
been
upheld?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
anything
changed
that
in
'59?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
concede,
wouldn't
you,
you'd
rather
have
the
government's
case
after
'59
than
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
'59
amendment
invalidated
any
tax
that
would
have
been
valid
before?
what
about
idaho?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
idaho?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
they
even...
why
was
anybody
ever
worried
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
congress
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
made
sure
that
idaho
wasn't...
the
tax
wasn't
going
to
pass
muster,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
--of
the
banking
provisions?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
you
would
feel
comfortable
with
the
proposition
that
the
state
could
tax
everybody...
that
banks
are
different
from
other
corporations,
that
the
state
could
not
tax
anyone
except
banks?
justice
byron
r.
white
banks
are
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
a
state
could
tax
banks
but
couldn't
tax
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
think
it
would
almost
run
the
other
way,
wouldn't
you?
because
these
are
national
banks
holding
federal
obligations.
and
yet
you
say
the
states
can
tax
them
even
if
they
couldn't
tax
any
other
corporation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
section
5719
had
never
been
on
the
books?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
the
'59
amendment
had
any
impact
on
that
van
allen
line
of
cases
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
tax
would
have
been
permissible
before
'59?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
'59
amendments
you
think
did
have
the
affect
of
overturning
that
line
of
cases,
van
allen
and
the
whole
crowd?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
well
as
that
theory--
justice
byron
r.
white
--as
well
as
that
theory.
doesn't
it
have
to
overturn
that
theory,
or
the
theory,
as
your
opponent
argues,
would
still
prevail
right
on
this
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
that
distinction
was...
it
isn't
germane
any
more
because
of
the
'59
amendments?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
statute
debated
on
the
floor?
did
it
ever
reach
the
floor,
or
was
it
just
on
the
consent
calendar?
