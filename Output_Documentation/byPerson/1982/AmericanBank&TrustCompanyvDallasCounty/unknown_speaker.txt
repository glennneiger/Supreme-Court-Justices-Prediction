unknown
speaker
finally,
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
question
that
was
raised
by
counsel
for
dallas
county
as
to
injury
or
harm.
at
the
time
the
1979
cases
were
first
before
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
entered
its
first
opinion,
in
which
it
resolved
every
single
state
law
question
that
was
involved
in
these
cases,
including
a
question
as
to
injury
which
was
specifically
raised
by
dallas
county
in
that
case.
now,
that
opinion
is
withdrawn.
i'm
not
saying
that
that
opinion
is
still
in
effect.
but
i
am
saying
that
this
court
in
the
1979
case
has
no
state
law
questions
concerning
injury
or
anything
else.
and
in
the
1980
case
there
was
a
judgment
entered
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
here,
which
was
then
vacated
and
a
new
judgment
entered
based
on
the
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
in
the
1979
case.
but
at
one
point
in
all
of
these
cases
all
state
law
questions
have
been
resolved
and
they're
not
present
in
the
case.
the
court
is
i
think
very
clearly
presented
with
a
pure
question
of
what
the
word
3701.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
