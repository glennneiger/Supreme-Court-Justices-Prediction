justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mayfield,
is
the
phrase
"life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole.
"
a
word
of
art
in
california
jurisprudence,
or
something
to
that
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mayfield,
did
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
its
analysis
of
the
federal
constitutional
question
differentiate
between
the
first
and
the
second
sentence
of
the
so-called
briggs
instruction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
reason
i...
let
me
read
you
the
first
sentence,
which
you
are
doubtless
very
familiar
with.
you
instructed
under
the
state
constitution
"a
governor
is
empowered
to
grant
a
reprieve,
pardon,
or
commutation
of
the
sentence
following
conviction
of
a
crime.
"
that
is
simply
a
statement
of
fact,
isn't
it,
that
the
governor
could
commute
a
death
sentence.
he
could
commute
a
life
sentence
without
parole.
he
could
commute
any
sentence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
supreme
court
of
california
feel
that
instruction
was
misleading?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
instruction
has
two
sentences
in
it.
at
least
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
object
to
the
first
of
the
two
sentences?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
think
its
holding
extends
to
holding
the
first
sentence
of
the
instruction
unconstitutional
on
federal
constitutional
grounds?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
earlier
decision
you
were
referring
to,
mr.
mayfield,
based
on
federal
constitutional
grounds?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
the
highest
court
of
any
state
might
do
in
reviewing
jury
instructions
given
in
that
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hendon,
you
said
that
there
were
some
twenty-odd
state
cases
involving
instructions
like
this,
were
they
perfect
counterparts
to
the
california
instruction?
did
they
have
the
first
sentence
as
it
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
first
part
of
the
first
sentence
is
misleading?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainly
the
use
of
the
article,
a,
is
a
very
indefinite
article.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
federal...
what
is
the
reasoning
of
the
state
courts
who
have
held...
how
many
did
you
say
there
were...
who
have
held
this
invalid
on
federal
constitutional
grounds?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
of
the
state
decisions
are
expressly
couched
in
federal
constitutional
terms?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
all
of
them.
you
said
there
were
28.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
inception
of
this
constitutional...
this
initiative.
someone
must
have
been
bothered
by
something
that
happened.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
a
federal
constitution
may
require
a
rule
that
says
even
though
we
tell
you
something
you
cannot
consider
what
we
are
telling
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
no
is
asking
the
jury
to
apply
a
standardless
arbitrary...
you
are
just
being
told
as
a
juror
that
there
is
such
a
standardless
arbitrary
factor
in
existence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
does
not
ask
the
jury
to
commute
or
exercise
political
judgment
to
assess
the
penalty.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
a
fact.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
they
account
for
lots
of
facts
that
they
find?
they
just
have
to
take
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
a
jury
considering
as
some
death
penalty
statutes
allow,
the
possibility
of
rehabilitation
of
this
particular
defendant?
that
is
a
relatively
standardless
judgment,
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
given
these
various
imponderables
such
as
jurors
knowing
it
from
civics
class
or
perhaps
having
voted
for
or
against
this
particular
initiative,
wouldn't
it
be
fair
to
say
that
the
state
ought
to
be
entitled
to
the
very
wide
latitude
in
making
decisions
as
to
what
kind
of
facts
go
before
the
jury
and
what
do
not...
that
it
is
not
simply
only
one
particular
set
of
instructions
which
pass
constitutional
muster?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
they
said
everything
but
the
last...
everything
but,
you
are
not
to
consider?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
it
is.
what
is
wrong
with
that
constitutionally?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
it
is
less
likely
that
a
jury
given
this
instruction
will
return
an
arbitrary
verdict
than
if
a
jury
which
is
given
no
instruction,
goes
out
to
the
jury
room...
three
of
the
people
voted
for
this
initiative,
four
of
them
voted
against
it,
two
others
know
something
about
the
commutation
part,
they
probably
each
have
a
somewhat
different
perception
about
it...
and
the
jury
argues
about
it
in
that
context?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
am
posing
no
instruction,
which
i
think
is
what
you
were
posing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
you
are
putting
the
state
courts
at
power
to
instruct
in
these
cases
in
a
very
narrow
bind
under
the
federal
constitution,
given
the
fact
that
courts
are
constantly
wondering,
will
the
jurors
probably
already
know
this,
should
i
instruct
on
it,
should
i
not?
not
just
in
this
area
but
lots
of
others.
and,
until
now
i
do
not
think
it
has
been
thought
the
federal
constitution
had
a
preference
one
way
or
the
other,
so
long
as
the
state
court
was
reasonably
fair
about
the
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
defendant
request
an
instruction
like
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wasn't
it
possible
after
the
enactment
of
this
initiative
that
a
reasonable
lawyer
might
think
that
state
law
would
change
in
that
regard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ordinarily
you
cannot
complain
about
the
failure
to
give
an
instruction
which
you
did
not
request.
if
you
say
this
would
have
been
a
fine
instruction
if
they
just
added
to
it
this
little
part
that
i
have
now
dreamed
up.
but
if
you
did
not
ask
the
trial
court
for
that
you
cannot
complain
about
it.
