mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent
was
sentenced
to
death
for
first-degree
murder
during
the
commission
of
a
robbery.
he
robbed
the
on-duty
employees
at
a
fast
food
restaurant
where
he
worked,
after
which
he
shot
both
of
them
in
the
head,
and
one
of
them
lived.
he
was
convicted
of
two
counts
of
robbery,
attempted
murder,
and
murder
of
the
first
degree,
along
with
a
special
allegation
that
the
murder
was
committed
during
the
commission
of
a
robbery.
under
the
california
penal
code,
murder
of
the
first
degree
is
punishable
by
25
years
to
life,
unless
certain
special
circumstances
are
alleged
and
found
true
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
which
case,
the
alternative
penalties
are
death
or
life
imprisonment
without
the
possibility
of
parole.
the
penalty
is
determined
at
a
separate
hearing
in
which
the
trier
of
fact
is
a
jury
unless
waived
by
both
parties.
at
that
separate
hearing
both
parties
may
present
additional
evidence,
and
the
statute
provides
for
certain
specified
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors
which
the
jury
must
consider
in
addition
to
an
additional
catch-all
factor
permitting
the
jury
to
consider
any
factor
in
litigation.
if
the
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
mitigating
circumstances,
the
jury
is
required
to
return
a
verdict
of
death.
if
mitigating
circumstances
outweigh
aggravating
circumstances,
the
jury
is
required
to
return
a
verdict
of
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole.
the
trial
judge
may
modify
a
verdict
of
death
to
one
of
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole;
although
if
the
jury
returns
the
lesser
punishment,
it
cannot
be
increased.
the
statute
also
requires
that
the
trier
of
fact
be
instructed
that
the
punishment
of
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole
may
in
the
future
be
modified
by
the
governor
to
include
a
lesser
sentence
which
permits
the
possibility
of
parole.
in
this
case,
defense
counsel
objected
to
that
instruction
being
given
on
the
ground
that
it
violated
his
right
to
due
process
of
law,
and
the
trial
judge
overruled
the
objection
on
the
ground
it
was
required
by
statute.
on
automatic
appeal
to
the
california
supreme
court,
the
court
expressly
and
exclusively
reversed
the
death
penalty
on
the
ground
that
the
portion
of
the
statute
which
required
the
giving
of
that
instruction
violated
the
defendant's
right
to
due
process
under
the
5th,
8th,
and
14th
amendments
for
two
reasons.
one,
that
it
introduced
an
extraneous
factor
into
the
jury's
deliberations.
and,
second,
that
it
was
misleading
because
it
did
not
require
an
instruction,
because
the
instruction
did
not
inform
the
jury
that
the
governor
could
also
commute
a
sentence
of
death
to
a
lesser
sentence.
the
issue
presented
on
certiorari
to
this
court
is
whether
enforcement
of
that
statutory
provision
requiring
instruction
violates
the
5th,
8th,
and
14th
amendments.
this
court's
cases
indicate
that
due
process
is
violated
whenever
a
defendant
is
deprived
of
some
guaranteed
right,
or
if
a
procedure
is
fundamentally
unfair.
in
the
capital
cases
which
sort
of
blend
the
5th,
the
14th,
and
8th
amendment
principles,
cases
have
held
that
a
procedure
which
increases
the
likelihood
of
an
arbitrary,
a
capricious,
or
unreliable
sentencing
determination
may
violate
due
process.
there
is
a
basic
distinction
this
court
has
drawn
between
capital
cases
and
others
on
the
ground
that
the
death
sentence
is
unique
in
its
finality.
a
subsidiary
question
under
the
question
presented
on
certiorari,
since
this
is
a
state
statutory
procedure,
is
the
question
whether
the
statute
clearly
and
unmistakably
violates
the
defendant's
due
process
rights.
in
california's
alternative
sentences,
the
sentence
of
death,
the
meaning
is
quite
clear.
if
that
sentence
is
carried
out,
the
defendant
will
be
put
to
death.
on
the
other
hand,
the
sentence...
the
alternative
sentence
of
life
without
possibility
of
parole
is
not
literally
accurate
because
it
does
not
mean
that
if
that
sentence
is
imposed
the
defendant
must
inevitably
be
perpetually
imprisoned...
imprisoned
until
death.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
it
is,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
literally
mean
what
it
says.
in
california
law,
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
permits
a
consideration
for
parole
after
seven
years.
the
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole
for
murder
was
not
available
in
california
until
1977.
previously,
that
sentence
was
only
imposed
on
certain
aggravated
forms
of
kidnapping.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
initiative,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
yes,
your
honor,
there
was--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--no,
your
honor,
not
in
the
legislature.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
he
can
be
paroled
because
of
the
statutory
and
constitutional
provisions
for
the
governor
to
commute
his
sentence.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
the
governor
can
commute
the
sentence--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
accurate.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
yes,
your
honor.
the
sentence
may
be
commuted
to
a
sentence
which
includes
the
possibility
of
parole.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
yes,
your
honor.
or
it
may
be
commuted
to
a
sentence
of
25
years
to
life.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
yes,
your
honor.
the
term
"without
possibility
of
parole"
is
on
its
face
misleading
because
it
is
not
literally
true
that
the
person
given
the
sentence
may
never
be
paroled--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--it
may
be
commuted
by
the
governor
to
a
sentence,
life
without
possibility
of
parole,
or--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
that
is
correct.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
not
necessarily--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--the
governor
can
set
his
own
criteria.
although,
for
individuals
sentenced
to
life
without
parole,
there
are
provisions
within
the
department
of
corrections...
regulations
for
them
to
consider
and
make
recommendations.
there
is
also
a
vast
difference
in
that
there
is
relatively
a
small
window
for
the
governor
to
commute
death
sentence,
during
this
period
after
all
the
appeals
have
expired
and
a
period
when
the
sentence
is
to
be
carried.
on
the
other
hand,
every
individual
who
is
in
prison
under
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
without
parole,
always
retains
the
possibility
that
he
may
be
commuted
and
not
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
in
prison.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
no,
your
honor--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--that
is
correct.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
no.
i
believe
not.
they
believe
what
was
misleading
is
the
fact
that
that
is
merely,
i
believe,
a
lead-in
to
the
operative
part
of
the
instruction
which
says
that
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
without
parole
may
be--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--i
believe
the
california
supreme
court
objects
to
the
entire
instruction
because
of
the
view
that
any
part
of
the
instruction
puts
an
extraneous
factor
into
the
jury's
consideration.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
so.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
i
believe
so,
yes.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
the
first
part
of
the
instruction
does
not
differentiate.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
yes.
it
does,
in
fact,
say
that.
but,
it
does
not
specifically
refer
to
the
death
sentence
whereas
the
second
part
of
the
instruction
does.
from
the
standpoint
of
the
alternatives
offered,
i
believe
it
is
reasonable
to
consider
that
the
determination
by
a
sentencer
will
in
some
way
be
affected
by
the
sentencer's
perception
of
the
alternatives
that
he
is
choosing
between.
for
example,
in
beck
v.
alabama
where
the
jury
could
only
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
a
capital
offense,
even
though
there
was
evidence
from
which
a
lesser
offense
could
be
returned,
this
court
found
that
that
would
skew
the
determination.
i
believe
that
the
determination
of
the
jury's
verdict
could
be
skewed
also
if
the
jury
believed
that
the
difference
between
the
alternative
punishments
is
minimal.
for
instance,
it
would
be
impermissible
under
the
california
statute
for
a
juror
who
was
convinced
that
aggravating
circumstances
outweighed
mitigating
circumstances
to
impose
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
without
possible
parole
because
he
believed
that
was
a
more
severe
sentence.
probably,
not
too
many
people
may
think
that,
but
i
suggest
there
are
some.
similarly,
it
would
be
impermissible
under
the
california
statute
for
a
juror
who
was
convinced
that
mitigating
circumstances
outweighed
aggravated
circumstances
to
impose
the
punishment
of
death,
because
he
thought
he
was
doing
the
defendant
a
favor.
in
this
case,
the
defendant
himself,
at
least,
told
at
least
his
psychiatrist
that
he
would
rather
have
the
death
penalty
than
life
without
parole.
there
is
a
probability
that
a
large
percentage...
a
substantial
percentage...
of
jurors
will
be
aware
of
california
law,
and
will,
in
any
event,
realize
that
there
is
a
power
of
commutation
of
sentences
of
life
without
parole...
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
parole.
but,
i
think
it
is
reasonable
for
california
to
decide
that
it
is
preferable
if
every
juror
in
every
case
is
aware
of
that
by
manner
of
a
simple
instruction
which
tells
them
this
fact.
when
we
speak
of
the
liability
of
sentencing
determinations,
i
think
that
consistency
is
of
some
significance.
as
to
the
other
part
of
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
that
the
instruction
is
misleading,
i
believe
it
is
significant
that
trial
counsel
below
did
not
make
that
argument.
and,
i
suggest
the
reason
possibly
is
set
forth
in
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
in
people
v.
morse,
back
in
60
cal
2d,
where
they
said
since
people
probably
know
something
about
parole,
you
should
tell
the
jury
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
parole,
but
tell
them
that
is
not
supposed
to
be
what
they
base
their
decision
on.
they
should
not
take
that
into
consideration.
on
the
other
hand,
you
should
not
tell
a
jury
about
the
power
of
a
trial
judge,
or
the
california
supreme
court,
or
the
governor
to
commute
a
sentence
of
death--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--no,
that
was
based
on
the
view
of
what
it
was
a
good
idea
to
tell--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--yes,
but
this
was
not
based
on
federal
constitutional
grounds
because
the
rationale
for
that
was
they
said
that
if
you
tell
a
jury
that
someone
else
might
change
their
death
penalty
decision,
that
may
lessen
their
sense
of
responsibility
for
this
awesome
thing
they
are
going
to
do
in
imposing
the
death
penalty.
and,
i
suggest
that
very
rarely
would
a
trial
counsel
want
to
have
that
instruction
given.
the
only
conceivable
reason
if
he
thought
that
aggravating
circumstances
were
so
overwhelming
that
he
wanted
to
convince
the
jury
it
made
no
difference.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
at
page
4,
i
believe,
of
the
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
counsel,
i
believe,
set
forth
a
list
over
a
period
of
some
years...
there
have
been
41
death
sentences
commuted
and
24
life
without
parole
during
that
period.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
i
cannot
tell
you...
i
do
not
recall
the
exact--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--yes,
a
period
of
quite
a
number
of
years.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
i
do
not
think
that
tells
very
much.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
it
does,
but
i
think
perhaps
expansion
would,
in
fact,
invite
speculation.
now,
one
think
this
instruction
does
is
remove
what
is
an
otherwise
misleading
connotation
that
the
difference
between
these
two
sentences,
death
and
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole,
may
appear
to
some
to
be
minimal--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--it
would
not
be
misleading,
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
possibility
of
commutation
for
life
without
possibility
of
parole
remains...
it
isn't...
you
didn't
get
commuted
now
so
you
are
all
through.
every
one
who
is
in
prison
now
has
that
possibility.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
well--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
suggest
that
if
california
had
chosen
to
eliminate
the
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole,
and
tell
the
jury
to
select
between
25
years
to
life
and
death,
that
the
jury
would
know
that
the
defendant
at
some
time
could
be
released
from
prison.
and,
it
would
not
in
that
case
be
necessary
to
inform
the
jury
that
the
death
penalty
could
be
commuted,
and
i
believe
that
california's
decision
that
it
may
make
for
a
more
reliable
and
consistent
decisions
to
inform
the
jury
of
the...
accurately
of
the
meaning
of
this
sentence
does
not
violate
any
guaranteed
right
of
the
defendant
or
does
not
make
the
decision
fundamentally
unfair
to
him
or
otherwise
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
i
do
not
know
the
exact
number.
i
think
about
30.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
that
was
the
number
of
cases,
i
believe,
that
had
been
perhaps
tried
under
the--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
yes,
your
honor.
in
regard
to
the
jurisdictional
question
of
the
issue
that
the
california
supreme
court
found
prejudicial
evidence,
it
was
bound
up
in
the
constitutional
issue
they
were
addressing.
prejudicial
evidence
they
found
admitted
included
the
defendant's
psychiatrist's
testimony
that
the
defendant
himself
knew
about
the
possibility
of
parole
and
was
considering
whether
he
might
want
to
take
revenge
if
he
were
paroled.
in
regard
to
amplifying
instructions,
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
find
and
the
statute
does
not
provide
that
a
defendant,
if
he
chose
to
do
so,
could
not
request
additional
amplifying
instructions
whether
they
related
to
a
disclaimer
telling
the
jury
not
to
consider
the
other
instruction
or
an
additional
instruction
about
commutation
of
the
death
penalty.
the
citation
to
gardner
v.
florida,
that
case
is
sort
of
the
obverse
of
this
case.
that
involved
the
instance
where
the
sentencer,
the
judge,
had
some
information
that
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
did
not
have,
and
may
have
based
his
decision
on
that.
well,
that
was
unfair.
in
this
case,
the
information
that
the
jury
was
given
is
information
which
the
defendant
knows,
his
counsel
knows,
and
we
are
asked
to
find
that
is
unfair
for
the
jury
to
know.
in
regard
to
a
necessity
for
some
prophylactic
measure
to
offset
this
instruction
to
the
jury
informing
them
that
there
is,
in
fact,
a
possibility
of
parole,
i
suggest
that
we
have
it
in
the
declarements
of
the
statute
itself,
which
sets
forth
specific
factors
for
the
jury
to
consider
and
permits
them
to
return
a
death
penalty
only
if
they
find
aggravating
factors
outweigh
mitigating
factors.
and,
i
suggest
that
this
instruction
is
not
about
commutation
anyway.
what
it
is
a
bout
is
about
the
indisputable
fact
that
this
sentence,
which
is
described
as
life
imprisonment
without
the
possibility
of
parole,
if
which
by
its
description
has
parole
in
it,
that
this
sentence
is,
in
fact,
not
a
sentence
that
has
no
possibility
of
parole.
that
is
what
the
subject
of
the
instruction
is.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
that
is
correct
as
it--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--i
am
not
saying
that
the
sentence
is...
i
am
saying
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
parole,
and
i
am
saying,
yes,
the
statute
is
valid
and
particularly
if
jurors
are
made
aware
of
the
fact
of
what
this
alternative
sentence
is.
the
jurors
are
not
told
to
speculate
as
to
when
the
defendant
might
be
paroled.
they
are
specifically
told
to
consider
these
factors
and
determine
whether
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
mitigating
circumstances.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
yes,
your
honor.
mr.

what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
reason
it
was
found
to
be
erroneous...
the
california
supreme
court
said
it
was
this
instruction--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--since
this
instruction
permitted
this
evidence
to
be
introduced,
it
found
that
the
mere
mention--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--my
response
to
that
is
that
the
error
they
found
on
state
law
grounds
was
error
because
of
the
conclusion
that
the
instruction
regarding
the
possibility
of
parole
was
erroneous
on
federal
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
because
it
is...
the
only
reason...
the
reason
it
was
erroneously
admitted
was
because
of
the
ruling
on
the
federal
constitutional
error.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
i
am
suggesting
that
on
state
law...
if
it
is
strictly
state
law
grounds...
then
under
the
state
law
the
california
supreme
court
would
have
to
examine
the
evidence
and
determine
that
a
miscarriage
of
justice
occurred.
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
yes--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--that
is
correct.
if
there
were
a
new
trial
in
all
cases,
the
california
supreme
court's
ruling--
mr.
harley
d.
mayfield
--i
do
not
go
that
far.
i
say
that
the
evidentiary
ruling...
the
finding
of
prejudice
is
so
bound
up
in
the
federal
constitutional
ruling
that
we
cannot
say
that
there
is
an
independent
state
problem.
