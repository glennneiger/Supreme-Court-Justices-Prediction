mr.
mayfield,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
and,
we
are
hearing
california
against
ramos.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
parole
is
quite
different
from
the
commutation
of
the
sentence,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
other
cases
are
likely
to
be
affected
by
a
decision
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
somewhere
in
the
record
i
had
seen
a
figure
of
90.
is
that
another
category?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
1978
statute?
yes.
i
cannot
say
where
the
justice
got
that
figure,
but
my
survey
indicates
about
30
may
be
affected.
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hendon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
misunderstood
your
first
statement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
really
think
you
can
generalize
that
way
about
what
motivates
governors
to
exercise
the
commutation
power?
some
governors
have
ad
hoc
advisory
committees
to
advise
them.
some
do
it
on
the
basis
of
some
newly
discovered
factor.
do
you
really
think
there
is
any
basis
for
generalizing
as
you
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
johnson...
andrew
johnson
and
governor
rockefeller
of
arkansas
certainly
did
purely
political--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--that
does
not
mean
that
commutations
generally
are
based
on
political
considerations.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nonjudicial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
this
has
happened
because
the
governor
has
conscientious
objections
to
the
death
penalty
per
se.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
likely
it
is
true
with
the
arkansas
situation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
entirely
possible
that
if
some
of
the
members
of
the
jury
have
their
civics
courses
within
ten
years
before
the
time
of
their
jury
service,
they
will
remember
that
governors
have
that
kind
of
commutation
power.
and,
then
are
you
not
dependent
on
having
one
or
several
jurors
give
some
supplemental
instructions
to
the
jury
about
the
commutaton
power
in
the
course
of
their
deliberation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
very
likely
that
some
of
them
will
know
out
of
12
members
of
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
mayfield?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
jones
against
barnes.
