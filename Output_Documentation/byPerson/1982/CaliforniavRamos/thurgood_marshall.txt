marshall
and,
that
was
by
referendum,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
it
was
referendum...
it
was
not
debated
or
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
was
not
debated
in
the
legislature?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
difference
between
the
governor's
considering
commutation
or
life
without
parole
in
a
death
penalty
if
both
done
the
same
way
by
the
governor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
are
there
different
standards
or
criteria
or
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
going
a
little
bit
too
far.
what
about
a
juror
who
knows
this?
what
about
a
juror
who
voted
for
this
law?
obviously
he
would
know
about
it.
would
he
be
ineligible
to
sit
as
a
juror?
you
see,
you
went
so
far
to
say
he
should
not
know
about
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
have
to
go
that
far--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--that
is
all
i
am
trying
to
get
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
still
not
correct.
governor
doyle
had
a
commission
and
he
at
the
last
date
would
put
his
own
lawyer
to
work
on
the
case
until
every
lead
had
been
run
down.
you
would
not
call
that
political,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
want
to
say
is
that
the
sentence
is
not
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
a
statute
that
is
not
true
a
valid
statute?
