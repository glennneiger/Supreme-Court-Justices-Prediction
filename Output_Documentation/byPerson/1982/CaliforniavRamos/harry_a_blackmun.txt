mr.
hendon--
justice
harry

blackmun
--perhaps
you
have
already
answered
this,
but...
if
so,
i
missed
it...
would
you
be
here
if
the
instruction
also
covered
the
capital
punishment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
you
have
know
choice,
you
are
the
respondent
any
way.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
they
might
know
that
he
could
commute
the
death
penalty.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
why
i
still
do
not
understand
why
you
draw
a
line
between
the
two.
had
this
jury
been
instructed
that
whether
they
impose
the
capital
offense,
or
capital
penalty,
on
the
one
hand,
or
life
without
parole
on
the
other,
the
governors
still
have
the
power
to
commute
in
either
case.
why
is
that
prejudicial
to
your
client?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
simply
balances
the
situation,
doesn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
then
you
run
into
the
chief
justice's
question.
somebody
may
know
it
from
a
civics
course
any
way.
and
this
you
cannot
prevent.
