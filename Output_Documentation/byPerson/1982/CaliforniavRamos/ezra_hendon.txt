mr.
ezra
hendon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
unique
provision...
there
is
no
other
statute
like
it
in
the
country...
containing
a
provision
which
has
been
universally
condemned
in
virtually
every
state
jurisdiction
that
has
been
called
upon
to
pass
on
it,
and
which--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--well,
there
is
no
other
statute
like
it.
the
issue
of
whether
commutation
can
go
to
a
jury
in
the
absence
of
a
statute
has
been
resolved
in
somewhere
around
28
state
court
jurisdictions.
twenty-four
of
those
28
state
courts
have
ruled
that
the
issue
of
commutation
in
any
form
cannot
go
to
a
jury
in
the
penalty
phase
of--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--no,
i
think--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--well,
many
of
them
are
cases
which
precede
this
court's
decisions
in
furman.
however,
there
are
a
number
of
recent
ones
which
have
been
cited
in
the
briefs,
and
there
are
more
every
day.
in
addition
to
those
cited
in
the
briefs,
there
are
two
that
have
come
down...
another
one
out
of
illinois
called
people
v.
zabo,
which
was
decided
on
january
24,
1983
and
another
out
of
maryland
called
poole
v.
maryland,
which
was
decided
on
january
7,
1983.
mr.
ezra
hendon
no,
they
are
not.
however,
i
personally
think
if
a
jury
in
a
noncapital
case...
a
jury
which
has
a
sentencing
function
in
a
noncapital
case...
cannot
hear
about
commutation
then
a
fortiori
cannot
hear
about
it
in
the
capital.
mr.
ezra
hendon
well,
only
to
the
extent
that
it
may
be
more
prejudicial
for
a
jury
in
a
unitary
proceeding
to
hear
about
it.
conceptually,
i
think
that
is
just
a
management
problem.
i
think
theoretically
and
conceptually
it
should
make
no
difference.
mr.
ezra
hendon
yes,
they
are
even
more
fair
than
the
california
instruction
because
our
contention
is
that
the
california
instruction
in
its
present
form
is
misleading
because
it
involves
partial
disclosure--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--yes,
your
honor,
i
do
because
i
do
not
frankly
read
it
the
same
way
you
do.
the
way
i
read
it,
it
says
you
are
instructed
that
under
the
state
constitution
a
governor
is
empowered
to
grant
a
reprieve,
pardon,
or
commutation
of
a
sentence
following
conviction
of
a
crime.
it
does
not
say
any
sentence.
it
does
not
say
all
sentences.
mr.
ezra
hendon
a
is...
my
grammar
is
not
what
it
should
be...
but
i
think
it
is
a
definite...
i
think
it
is
a
particular
sentence.
it
does
not...
there
is
at
least
ambiguity
in
whether
it
is
saying
all
sentences.
a
sentence
and
all
sentences
are
not
the
same,
logically
or
grammatically.
mr.
ezra
hendon
i
think
if
you
examine
the
reasoning
behind
the
state
court
decisions,
they
go
off
on
grounds
which
are
ultimately
federal
constitutional
grounds,
though
they
may
have
preceded
furman
so
that
they
are
not
couched
in
constitutional
terms,
but
the
logic
and
the
reasoning
is
that
the
issue
of
commutation,
even
when
the
issue
of
commutation
is
put
before
the
jury...
even
when
a
jury
is
told
that
governor
can
commute
both
life
without
parole
sentence
and
the
death
sentence,
which
this
instruction
does
not
do...
but
when
the
issue
is
put
before
the
jury
even-handedly,
that
injects
a
level
of
speculation
into
the
jury's
sentencing
phase
which
renders
any
decision
it
may
return
unreliable
and
which
diverts
it
from
its
primary
task,
which
is
after
all
what?
it
is
to
decide
whether
this
individual,
in
light
of
this
crime,
should
die.
mr.
ezra
hendon
of
the
recent
ones--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--i
can
think
of
three
off-hand.
the
most
recent
illinois
case.
i
believe
poole
v.
maryland
is
federal
constitutional.
i
think
the
louisiana
case,
lindsey,
is.
there
are
two
reasons
why
this
provision,
i
think...
this
particular
provision...
cannot
pass
constitutional
muster.
first,
it
affirmatively
misleads
a
jury
in
the
penalty
phase
of
a
capital
case
as
to
the
nature
of
its
function
and
the
consequences
of
its
decision.
and,
secondly,
as
i
have
alluded
to,
it
injects
a
level
of
speculation
and
uncertainty
into
the
penalty
decision,
which
cannot
be
tolerated
in
the
capital
case
and
which
deflects
the
jury
from
its
true
task.
what
does
this
statute
do?
it
tells
a
jury,
in
effect,
you
have
two
choices
here.
you
can
sentence
to
life
without
parole,
or
you
can
sentence
to
death.
but
you
should
bear
in
mind
that
life
without
parole
does
not
mean
life
without
parole,
that
the
governor
can
commute
life
without
parole.
and,
i
may
say
in
passing
in
response
to
the
question
that
justice
rehnquist
asked
that
the
term
life
without
parole
is
no
more
a
term
of
art
in
the
state
of
california
than
is
the
term
death.
mr.
ezra
hendon
yes,
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
this
initiative
was
to
overrule
the
case
of
people
v.
morse,
which
told
the
jury...
what
the
case
of
people
v.
morse
did
was
to
tell
the
jury,
look,
you
may
speculate
about
issues
such
as
parole
or
commutation,
and
i,
the
judge,
will
tell
you
about
parole
and
commutation
so
that
you
will
know
what
the
truth
is,
and
so
that
you
will
not
speculate.
but,
morse
goes
on
and
says,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
your
oaths
as
jurors
if
you
were
to
consider
this
factor
in
rendering
your
decision.
your
decision
is
to
be
based
upon
the
facts
of
the
case
and
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
on
nothing
else.
mr.
ezra
hendon
no,
my
only
position
is--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--no
i
don't.
i
did
not
mean--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--yes.
well
you
are
perfectly
correct.
i
didn't...
if
i
left
the
impression
that
i
was
going
that
far
then
i
take
it
back
because
i
do
not
mean
to--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--you
see,
the
way
the
states...
the
issue
on
which
the
state
split
is
not
whether
a
jury
can
know
about
commutation.
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case,
and
i
think
it
needs
to
be
clearly
understood
that
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
jury
can
consider
commutation
and
parole.
there
are
many
states
which
say,
as
morse
did
originally,
you
may
speculate
about
this.
you
may
speculate
about
parole.
you
may
speculate
about
commutation.
here
is
the
truth
about
it.
you
cannot
consider
it.
that
is
all
we
are
involved
in
in
this
case.
all
we
are
involved
in
is
the
question
of
whether
the
jury
can
consider
it.
mr.
ezra
hendon
i
think
the
federal
constitution
requires
that
there
be
an
assurance
that
a
jury
in
a
capital
case
does
not
predicate
its
decision
on
unreliable,
speculative
information
which
deflects
from
its
constitutionally
mandated
task,
and
yes,
i
think
that--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--why
wouldn't
it
be
permissible
to
inform
them
about
it
so
that
they
do
not
speculate
about
it.
some
prophylactic
measure
has
to
be
taken
so
that
they
do
not
predicate
the
decision
on
it.
mr.
ezra
hendon
yes.
mr.
ezra
hendon
because
in
that
event,
which
is
a
question
that
the
court
need
not
reach
in
this
case,
but
in
that
event
the
issue
of
commutation
would
still
be
before
the
jury.
the
jury
could
still
take
into
account
the
fact
that
a
governor
could
commute
a
death
sentence,
for
example.
and
to
the
extent
that
it
took
that
into
account
it
would
be
taking
into
account
the
utterly
unknowable.
what
a
california
governor,
perhaps
a
governor
who
has
not
even
been
elected
yet,
may
do
some
day
in
the
future
is
obviously
something
that
no
sitting
juror
can
know
about.
mr.
ezra
hendon
yes,
i
would.
that
is
the
effect--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--well,
the
state
law
is
and--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--no,
only
that
if
there
is
one,
some
steps
must
be
taken
to
make
sure
that
it
is
not
being
considered
by
the
jury.
in
other
words,
to
tell
the
jury
something
they
may
speculate
about--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--well
i
am
not
going
to
make
that--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--that
is
right.
mr.
ezra
hendon
no,
i
would
have
a
much
more
difficult
argument.
i
would
have
the
argument,
you
know,
the
skunk
in
the
jury
box
argument.
you
put
a
skunk
in
the
jury
box
and
then
tell
the
jury
not
to
smell
it.
can
you
really...
is
this
the
kind
of
information
that
a
jury
really
could
be
asked
to
disregard.
it
is
an
issue
that
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
it
is
not
one
that
the
court
needs
to
reach,
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
not
reach
it.
i
think
we
need
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
what
a
jury
is
being
asked
to
consider
when
it
is
being
asked
to
consider
commutation.
it
is
being
asked
to
consider
what
is
perhaps
the
most
wide-ranging,
open-ended
untrammeled
power
that
an
executive
can
have.
this
court's
opinions
over
and
over
and
over
again,
and
california
opinions
over
and
over
and
over
again,
have
made
clear
that
the
power
of
the
governor
to
commute
is
virtually
unlimited.
he
can
do
so
for
any
reason
he
sees
fit
at
almost
any
time
that
he
sees
fit.
and,
in
point
of
fact,
as
the
chart
which
justice
stevens
alluded
to
makes
clear,
california
governors
have
exercised
that
power
as
they
saw
fit,
in
terms
of
their
political
view,
their
political
perspective
of
what
is
an
appropriate
case
to
commute
taking
into
consideration
all
of
the
political,
essentially
nonjudicial
factors
that
go
into
a
decision
to
pardon
or
to
commute.
and,
to
ask
a
jury
to
somehow
factor
that
in
to
the
penalty
phase
of
the
capital
case
is
to
ask
it
to
do
the
impossible...
is
to
ask
it
to
consider
information
which
is
the
essence
of
speculation,
the
essence
of
uncertainty.
i
suggest
it
is
not
possible.
it
is
essentially
unreliable.
it
also,
i
suggest,
deflects
the
jury
from
the
task
that
it
is
set
forth
to
do.
whether
a
governor
is
going
to
commute
a
sentence
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
marcelino
ramos
as
far
as
the
jury
is
concerned.
a)
they
will
never
know
whether
the
governor
is
going
to
commute
him;
and
b)
if
he
does,
he
can
do
so,
as
i
said,
for
any
reason
he
sees
fit.
there
have
been
governors
in
this
country
who
have
commuted
all
death
sentences.
i
believe
winthrop
rockefeller
before
he
left
office
in
arkansas,
commuted
all
death
sentences...
cleaned
out
death
row.
this
was
a
political
decision
that
he
made.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
who
was
on
there.
it
was
within
his
power
to
do
so.
president
andrew
johnson
has
commuted
all
sentences
of
all
secessionists.
this
was
a
political
decision,
which
he
was
free
to
make
for
what
reasons
he
makes.
and,
i
suggest,
respectfully
to
the
court
that
when
we
come
to
the
point
when
juries
in
the
most
serious
case,
which
the
criminal
law
at
least
knows,
are
making
their
decisions
not
on
the
basis
of
what
they
may
think
is
appropriate
in
terms
of
this
individual
and
this
crime,
his
background,
what
he
did
and
why
he
did
it.
not
on
that
basis,
but
on
the
basis
of
what
some
future
governor
may
do
in
the
exercise
of
a
power
which
he
exercises
pursuant
to
considerations
which
are
wholly
alien
to
judicial
considerations.
mr.
ezra
hendon
well,
i
think
that
makes
my
point,
with
all
due
respect.
there
is
no
basis
for
generalizing,
and
therefore,
there
is
no
basis
on
which
a
jury
can
generalize.
mr.
ezra
hendon
yes.
mr.
ezra
hendon
no,
they
may
not
be,
but
they
can
be.
and,
when
they
are
they
do
not
focus
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
and,
when
they
do
focus
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
they
focus
on
the
governor's
view
of
the
facts
of
the
case.
the
jury
is
told
nothing
about
the
governor's
view
of
the
facts
of
the
case--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--well,
what
i
mean
by
political...
historically...
perhaps
i
am
not
using
the
word
correctly...
historically--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--nonjudicial...
historically
the
power
of
commutation
stems
from
the
power
of
the
sovereign
to
dispense
grace.
the
sovereign
could
dispense
grace--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--any
other
reasons
that
he
saw
fit,
yes.
finally--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--absolutely.
mr.
ezra
hendon
absolutely.
i
agree.
to
inject
my
point
is
to
inject
that
into
the
penalty
phase
of
the
capital
case...
is
to
inject
a
standardless,
arbitrary
factor
in
which
gets
us
back
to
state
of
the
law--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--this
statute
puts
the
issue
of
commutation
before
the
jury
for
its
consideration.
mr.
ezra
hendon
no,
but
it
puts
it
before
the
jury
as
a
factor
for
the
jury's
consideration.
mr.
ezra
hendon
yes,
but
how
does
a
jury
account
for
that
fact?
mr.
ezra
hendon
but
this
is
a
classic
instance
in
which
you
are
going
to
have
two
juries
with
different
views
of
when
a
governor,
perhaps
as
yet
an
unelected
governor,
is
going
to
exercise
the
power
of
commutation
coming
back
with
different
verdicts
in
cases
which
would
otherwise
be
the
same--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--well,
but
it
is
a
factor
that
is
tied
to
the
defendant
in
the
case.
it
proceeds
from
an
assessment
of
the
evidence
that
has
been
put
before
this
jury
tied
to
this
person.
what
is
the
likelihood
in
the
light
of
his
life,
his
background,
his
crime,
his
family,
all
of
those
factors,
that
this
is
an
individual
who
can
be
rehabilitated.
mr.
ezra
hendon
it
is
possible
that
jurors
would
know
about
commutation.
it
is
possible
that
they
would
not.
mr.
ezra
hendon
yes,
i
would
say
that
it
might
be
likely
that
some
of
them
would
know
about
it.
i
would
agree.
i
don't
know--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--they
might.
mr.
ezra
hendon
because
if
the
jury
thinks
about...
what
is
going
to
go
on
in
the
mind
of
a
juror
when
he
or
she
thinks
about
the
power
of
the
governor
to
commute
the
death
sentence?
he
is
going
to
think...
one
possible
psychology
which
has
been
commonly
referred
to
is,
somebody
else
is
going
to
be
looking
over
my
shoulder.
if
i
make
a
mistake,
it
is
not
so
bad.
there
will
be
somebody
looking
at
it
who
can
possibly
correct
it.
and
a
juror
constitutionally
should
not
be
permitted
that.
a
juror
should
resolve
for
him
or
herself--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--no,
it
eliminates
that
defect,
yes.
it
balances
the
situation,
but
it
does
not
address
the
question
of
what
kind
of
information
can
be
before
a
jury
for
its
consideration
so
that
we
wind
up
with
consistent--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--no,
you
cannot.
you
can
only
do
your
best.
you
cannot
absolutely
prevent
it,
and
we
are
not
faced
in
this
case
with
the
question
of
whether
there
needs
to
be
an
affirmative
instruction.
mr.
ezra
hendon
no,
i
agree
with
that,
and
i
do
not
contend
otherwise.
if
this
were
a
case
in
which
the
instructions
said
to
the
jurors,
here
is
the
governor's
power
to
commute
life
without
parole
sentences.
here
is
the
governor's
power
to
commute
death
sentences.
you
are
instructed
not
to
consider
these
factors.
they
are
not
relevant
for
you
in
coming
to
the
task
which
the
constitution
and
the
law
imposes
upon
you.
we
would
have
a
very
different
case.
mr.
ezra
hendon
well,
then
i
think
the
presumption
has
got
to
be
that
they
are
considering
it.
mr.
ezra
hendon
because
there
is
no
way
that
a
jury
can
factor
that
in
to
its
decision
in
a
way
which
satisfies
the
repeated
injunction
of
this
court's
cases
since
furman,
that
the
state
must
take
extraordinary
measures...
i
believe
was
justice
o'connor's
language
in
eddings...
must
go
to
extraordinary
measures
in
order
to
ensure
that
death
sentences
are
not
returned
on
the
basis
of
arbitrariness,
caprice,
or
mistake.
mr.
ezra
hendon
your
honor,
that
is
not
that
this
case...
you
are
posing
to
me
the
situation...
as
i
understand
your
question...
you
are
posing
to
me
the
situation
where
the
choice
is
between
an
instruction,
which
tells
them
about
it
and
tells
them
to
disregard
it
or
this
instruction.
mr.
ezra
hendon
no,
i
am
saying
that
no
instruction
may
pass
constitutional
muster.
mr.
ezra
hendon
no,
i
think
the
federal
constitution
makes
very
clear
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
information
that
can
go
before
a
sentencer
in
a
capital
case.
i
think
in
gardner
v.
florida
this
court
ruled
that
potentially
unreliable
information
by
a
judge,
in
that
case...
potentially
unreliable
information
put
before
a
judge
under
a
statute
which
this
court
had
otherwise
previously
upheld
as
constitutional
in
proffitt
v.
florida
required
a
remand
for
a
new
sentencing
hearing.
this
court
has
gone
to
great
lengths
to
ensure
that
a
part
of
the
capital
sentencing
decision
is
not
arbitrary,
unknowable,
speculative
information.
many,
many
things
happen
after
the
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
death.
there
is
review
by
the
state's
highest
court.
should
a
jury
be
told
about
that?
they
may
speculate
about
that?
there
is
escape.
people
die
in
prison.
people
are
killed
in
prison.
many,
many
things
can
happen.
it
strikes
me
that
the
system
only
works...
and
the
constitution
requires
for
the
system
to
work...
that
jurors
do
their
duty.
their
duty
is
to
do
what
they
think
is
right
based
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
to
assume
that
other
duly
constituted
authority
will
do
its
job.
the
governor
will
do
his
job.
the
jury
does
its
job.
the
supreme
court
does
its
job.
it
works
that
way.
it
does
not
work
if
you
have
got
juries
basing
decisions
on
what
the
governor
is
going
to
do.
before
leaving,
i
do
not
want
us
to
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
specific...
that
there
are
two
specific
issues
in
this
case.
one
involves
this
particular
instruction.
i
have
been
arguing
all
this
time
on
the
assumption
that
the
entire
issue
of
commutation
should
not
be
before
the
jury
whether
we
are
talking
about
death
commutation
or
life
without
parole
commutation.
we
are
faced
with
this
particular
statute,
and
i
ask
the
court
to
bear
that
in
mind.
this
is
a
statute
which
involves
partial
disclosure,
neither
more
nor
less.
the
jury
is
told
that
life
without
parole
does
not
mean
life
without
parole
period.
they
are
not
told
that
death
does
not
mean
death,
even
though
death
clearly
does
not
mean
death.
mr.
ezra
hendon
state
law
prohibited
the
defendant
from
requesting--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--i
do
not
know
what
the
federal
constitutional
significance
of
that
reasonable
possibility
is.
if
we
are
talking
about...
certainly
there
is
no
procedural
default--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--well,
i
think,
if
i
take
the
thrust
of
your
question
correctly,
what
you
are
really
talking
about
is
a
procedural
default,
in
essence
object
at
trial.
the
california
supreme
court
has
reached
the
issue
on
the
merits
in
this
case.
there
is
no
issue.
whatever
shortcoming
of
state
law
and
state
procedure
there
may
have
been
in
failing
to
tender
this
instruction
to
the
jury
has
been
forgiven
by
the
california
supreme
court.
that
is
no
obstacle
to
this
court's
going
on
and
reaching
it.
i
ask
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
stated
flat
out
that
if
this
were...
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
provision
here
which
were
an
installment...
a
provision
of
an
installment
sales
contract
for
the
purchase
of
an
automobile,
and
it
were
before
a
municipal
court
somewhere
in
the
state
of
california,
that
that
court
would
be
required
to
strike
it
down.
this
is
the
equivalent
of
telling
somebody
i
have
two
automobiles
to
sell.
i
want
you
to
know
that
one
of
them
has
a
cracked
engine
block,
not
disclosing
that
the
other
one
also
has
a
cracked
engine
block.
there
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
this.
and,
i
suggest,
that
if
it
is
not
good
enough
for
a
municipal
court
in
the
state
of
california
then
it
ought
not
be
good
enough
in
a
death
case
before
the
highest
court
in
the
land.
the
other
thing
that
i
guess
needs
to
be
mentioned...
although
i
do
not
think
more
can
be
done
about
it
than
mention
it...
is
that
there
is
a
procedural
problem
in
this
case.
i
think
there
is
a
serious
question
about
the
security
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
there
is
a
ruling
on
the
merits
of
a
state
law
issue
in
this
case
contained
at
footnote
22
of
the
court's
opinion.
it
is
the
last
issue
briefed
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
in
which
the
california
supreme
court
has
ruled
flatly
that
there
was
an
error
of
state
law
in
this
case
under
california
evidence
code,
section
352,
in
the
admission
of
certain
highly
prejudicial
error,
basically
statements
of
the
defendant
that
he
might
seek
revenge
on
the
jurors.
but
the
california
supreme
court
has
ruled
under
california
evidence
law...
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
question
there...
that
this
was
erroneously
admitted.
it
should
not
be
repeated
at
retrial.
they
did
not
go
on
and
reach
the
question
of
whether
that
error
standing
by
itself
and
without
regard
to
the
federal
constitutional
question
would
require
a
reversal.
i
suggest
it
is
a
very
serious
error--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--it
went
to
the
penalty
phase...
strictly
to
penalty,
yes.
the
california
supreme
court
purported
to
predicate
its
decision
on
the
federal
constitution,
and,
therefore,
it
did
not
address
the
question
of
whether
this
error
standing
by
itself
should
mandate
reversal
of
the
penalty
phase.
in
a
situation
like
that
i
suggested
in
the
brief
that
this
court
cannot
feel
secure
that
the
petitioner
has
met
his
burden
of
demonstrating
not
only
that
the
court
predicated
its
decision...
that
the
california
supreme
court
predicated
its
decision
on
a
federal
constitutional
ground,
but
that
that
ground
was
necessary
to--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--well,
the
two
options
that
this
court's
cases
have
followed
in
that
situation
is
either
to
dismiss
the
writ
as
having
been
improvidently
granted,
or
to
vacate
the
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court
and
remand
for
a
determination
of
whether
the
violation
of
california
evidence
law,
standing
by
itself
would...
and
apart
from
any
consideration,
federal
constitutional
considerations...
would
require
reversal
of
the
penalty.
