justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
possibility
of
parole
for
a
person
who
is
sentenced
to
life
without
possibility
of
parole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
can
be
paroled?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
commutation
by
the
governor
considered
a
parole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
the
governor
put
him
on
parole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
that
the
life
sentence
without
possibility
of
parole
is
really
accurate,
isn't
it,
because
he
cannot
be
paroled?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mayfield,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
the
red
brief
has
in
it
a
table
telling
us
how
often
the
california
governors
have
actually
commuted
death
sentences,
is
there
anything
before
us
that
tells
us
how
often
california
governors
have
commuted
life
sentences
without
possibility
of
parole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
what
period
was
that
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
twenty
four
over
some
several
year
period?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
would
the
defendant
be
entitled
to
have
the
judge
tell
that
to
the
jury
that
this
possibility
had
actually
occurred
only
24
times
in
the
past
20
years
or
whatever
the
figure
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
doesn't
it
tell
more
than
briggs
instruction
tells?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
mayfield,
supposing
your
24
examples
are
24
out
of
24,000...
i
don't
know
how
many
sentences
this
kind
of
put
in
effect...
but
if
in
99
and
99/100
percent
of
the
cases,
it
is,
in
fact,
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole,
how
misleading
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose,
you
might
tell
them
about
the
possibility
of
escape,
then,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean
it
is
equally
frequent,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
the
jurisdictional
point
for
a
moment?
the
testimony
that
was
erroneously
admitted,
as
i
remember,
was
the
psychiatrist's
testimony
that
this
defendant
had
said
that
if
his
sentence
is
commuted,
he
might
seek
revenge
against
the
prosecutor,
the
judge,
and
the
jury?
was
that
what
he
said,
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
and
your
view
is,
even
though
that
is
a
matter
of
state
law...
an
error
of
state
law...
it
would
presumably
be
harmless
error,
is
that
your
thought?
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
reversing
the
conviction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
instruction
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
sentence
might
be
commuted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
i
am
not
quite
clear
on
what
your
response
is.
the
jurisdictional
argument
that
your
opponent
makes
is
that
well,
this
is
clearly
an
error
of
state
law.
the
california
supreme
court
has
told
us
that.
and,
it
is
rather
obviously
a
fairly
significant
error
because
it
suggests
to
the
jury
that
they
ought
to
sentence
the
man
to
death
in
order
to
protect
themselves,
and,
therefore,
the
judgment
would
have
been
reversed
on
state
law
grounds
even
if
they
are
wrong
about
the
federal
constitution.
and,
if
that
is
true,
then
we
do
not
have
jurisdiction.
now,
what
is
your
response
to
the
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
it
is
still
ultimately
a
state
law
ground
as
to
the
erroneously
admitted
evidence,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
are
not
suggesting
that
it
would
have
been
harmless
error?
let
me
just
be
sure
i
get
that
to
one
side?
