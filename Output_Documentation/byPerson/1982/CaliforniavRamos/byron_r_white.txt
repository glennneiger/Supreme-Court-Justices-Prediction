justice

white
it
may
just
be
commuted
to
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
the
parole
would
be
a
possibility?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
get
the
same
result
if
the
instruction
said,
the
governor
may
commute
any
sentence,
including
a
sentence
of
death?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
essentially
what
the
instruction
says,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
governor
can
commute
anything,
including
a
death
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
on
state
grounds--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
this
supervisory
or
federal
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
shouldn't
the
question
then
be
asked
at
voir
dire,
do
you
know
about
this...
anybody
who
knows
about
it
should
be
off
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
be
satisfied
if
the...
if
any
reference
to
commutation
were
eliminated
from
the
instructions?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
jurors
who
know
about
this
power
are
not
told
not
to
consider
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
part
of
your
submission
is
not
that
there
must
be
an
instruction
not
to
consider?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you...
if
this
instruction
went
on
and
said
exactly...
if
this
instruction
were
the
same
except
you
had
appendent
to
it,
but
you
should
not
consider
this?
that
would
be
all
right
with
you?
then
you
would
not
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
might
be
here
on
some
other
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
political
reasons
or
any
other
reasons.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
that
just
go
to
the...
what
did
it
go
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
we
agreed
with
you.
what
would
you
suggest?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
were
remanded
as
your
colleague
suggests,
or
if
we
ruled
that
there
is
an
adequate
independent
state
ground,
i
take
it
that
would
be
on
the
basis
there
was
going
to
be
a
new
trial.
and,
i
suppose
the
new
trial
would
go
forward
without
this
instruction,
since
the
state
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
the
instruction
is
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
if
the
new
trial
went
forward
and
the
state
lost,
the
federal
issue
would
be
foreclosed,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
without
the
federal
constitutional
ruling
which
you
say
is
erroneous,
the
state
would
never...
the
state
court
would
never
have
made
this
evidentiary
rule.
