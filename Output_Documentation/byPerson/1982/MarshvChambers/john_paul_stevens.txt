justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
think
the
result
would
be
the
same
if
the
rule
had
provided
that
every
committee
hearing
shall
open
with
a
prayer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
reason
here,
to
have
a
solemn
beginning
and
get
everybody
in
the
proper
mood
to
start
their
deliberations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
have
any
trouble
with
the
nebraska
rule
if
it
said...
if
16
years
ago
they
passed
a
rule
that
said,
for
the
next
16
years
the
prayer
shall
be
conducted
by
a
presbyterian
minister?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
one
of
the
things
that
apparently
troubled
the
court
of
appeals.
i
was
just
wondering
if,
instead
of
looking
at
it
in
hindsight,
we
looked
at
it
in
advance,
would
it
bother
you
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
cronk,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about
it.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
publication
of
the
prayers
at
state
expense.
but
yet,
as
i
understand
it
there
was
no...
the
district
court's
order
which
held
that
invalid,
i
believe,
was
not
appealed.
what
is
the
status
of
that
part
of
the
case
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
kind
of
puzzling.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
even
before
the
first
amendment
was
adopted?
it
wasn't
retroactive.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cronk,
do
you
take
the
position
that
you
never
could
prove
an
establishment
clause
violation
without
proving
that
the
membership
of
the
favored
church
had
increased
over
the
period
that
the
challenged
practice
was
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
say
you
had
a...
that
nebraska
passed
a
law
saying
that
for
the
next
100
years
we
want
a
presbyterian
minister.
nobody
knows
whether
that
will
ever
make
any
more
people
presbyterians
or
not.
wouldn't
that
be
plainly
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
in
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
you'd
have
to
have
a
gallup
poll
kind
of
inquiry
to
decide
whether
it's
unconstitutional
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
some
cases...
i'm
not
suggesting
this
is
one,
but
there
are
some
cases
where
you
can
just
look
at
the
practice
and
say
it
favors
one
religion
over
others,
can't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
this
isn't
such
a
case.
i
didn't
mean
that.
but
i
don't
think
you're
really
arguing
you
have
to
go
out
and
prove
what
the
membership
of
the
churches
is
in
order
to
identify
some
practices
as
violating
the
establishment
clause.
