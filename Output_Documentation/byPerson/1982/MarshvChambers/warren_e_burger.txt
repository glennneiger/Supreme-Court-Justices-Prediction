chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
marsh
v.
chambers.
mr.
cronk,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
basis
of
his
claim,
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
a
paid
or
an
unpaid
clergyman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
response
to
justice
blackmun?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if,
mr.
friedman,
as
is
often
the
case,
you
had
a
clergyman
who
was
a
member
of
the
legislature
and
as
an
economy
measure
they
drafted
him
to
give
the
invocation
every
morning?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
member
of
the
legislature,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
ask
hypothetical
questions
very
frequently.
you'll
get
many
of
them
today,
i'm
sure.
what
would
you
think
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
disapprove.
would
you
say
it's
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
right.
now,
a
non-clergyman
member
of
the
legislature,
a
nebraska
farmer,
cattleman,
lawyer,
gets
up
and
has
an
invocation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
right,
let's
change
it,
then.
you
have
a
lot
of
members
of
the
legislature.
they
rotate
it
alphabetically.
anderson
starts
off,
babcock
next,
and
cronk
after
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why?
[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
less.
why
is
it
less?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
now,
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
or
the
senate,
i
believe,
for
about...
until
recently
had,
by
coincidence,
a
presbyterian
chaplain
for
about
eight
or
ten
years.
you
would
have
thought
that
was
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
our
invocation
that
the
marshal
announced
this
morning
when
he
concluded
calling
the
court
and
said
at
the
end,
"god
save
the
united
states
and
this
honorable
court?
"
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
we
go
back
to
the
members
of
the
legislature.
if
that's
your
view,
then
members
of
the
legislature
could
get
up
and
individually
give
opening
prayers
every
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we're
not
here
on
preferences,
mr.
friedman.
we're
here
to
discuss
a
constitutional
issue.
you
have
claimed
that
the
conduct
is
unconstitutional
and
for
my
part
i
just
want
to
see
how
far
you'll
carry
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
would
follow,
i
suppose,
that
the
constitutional
convention
engaged
in
an
unconstitutional
practice
by
having
a
prayer
to
open
each
session
in
philadelphia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
wouldn't
do
him
much
good
to
question
the
right
of
people
to
pray,
would
it,
with
the
first
amendment
and
the
religion
clauses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
before
the
legislature
met
they
announced
throughout
the
state
that
every
clergyman
in
the
state
would
be
invited
to...
or
every
clergyman
in
lincoln,
nebraska,
to
eliminate
the
travel
problem,
would
be
invited
to
come
and
give
one
day
in
rotation?
and
then
they
would
pull
them
out
of
a
hat
in
order.
you
still
think
that
raised
a
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
the
presbyterian
factor
is
irrelevant
to
your
argument,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say
the
result
would
be
the
same
if
you
had
all
the
clergymen
in
lincoln,
and
i
suppose
there
must
be
50
or
60
of
them,
maybe
more.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you've
said
several
times
that
even
if
you
had
chaplains
picked
at
random
one
day
at
a
time,
you'd
have
the
same
objection.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seemed
to
make
a
difference
earlier
in
your
argument
between
legislatures
and
courts.
do
you
think
an
extended
prayer,
as
distinguishes
from
the
very
brief
invocation,
would
be
unconstitutional
in
a
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
how
about
this
very
short
version
that
the
marshal
uses
to
summon
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
a
tension
in
every
application
of
the
religion
clauses,
a
tension
between
the
two
branches
of
the
religion
clauses.
and
all
of
our
cases
have
indicated
that,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
this
has
been
going
on
for
more
than
200
years,
right
back
to
the
confederation.
would
you
say
that
we
are
closer
to
having
an
established
church,
such
as
england
and
sweden,
for
example,
today
than
we
were
200
years
ago?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
where
is
the
establishment
of
a
religion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
cronk?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
