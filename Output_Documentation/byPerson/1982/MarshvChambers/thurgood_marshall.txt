justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
you
never
had
a
non-christian
chaplain,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
if
you
said
so,
name
him,
because
i'm
sure
there's
not...
i
thought
that
was
admitted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
have
the
prayers
are
in
the
record,
aren't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren't
the
prayers
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
prayer
in
there
that
doesn't
invoke
the
guidance
of
christ,
c-h-r-i-s-t?
can
you
show
me
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
admit
it,
do
you?
you
don't
admit
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
they're
all
christians,
all
of
the
chaplains
have
been
christians?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
no
idea?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
cronk,
in
this
case
did
the
chaplain
do
anything
other
than
give
a
prayer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
i
mean
that
was
actually
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
the
lutheran
minister
that
applied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
know,
but
the
record
said
that
at
least
one
did
apply.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
applicant,
not
chaplain.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
be
careful,
now.
you
might
leave
out
one.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
might
be
named
brown,
brown
versus
the
board
of
education.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
friedman,
before
this
case
was
filed,
in
your
own
estimation
how
many
people
outside
the
legislature
knew
about
the
chaplain?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
whole
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
same
state
that
don't
know
their
own
legislators
would
know
that
there
was
a
chaplain
there?
