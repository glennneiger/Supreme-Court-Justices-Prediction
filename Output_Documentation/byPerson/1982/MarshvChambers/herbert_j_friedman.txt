mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear
what
this
lawsuit
is
about
and
what
it's
not
about.
it's
about
a
very
narrow
question
that
was
presented
by
the
petitioners,
drafted
by
their
counsel,
and
accepted
for
review
by
this
court.
the
question
presented
is
this:
whether
the
nebraska
legislature's
compensation
and
retention
of
a
single
individual
as
chaplain
for
an
extended
period
of
time
renders
its
legislative
prayer
in
violation
of
the
establishment
clause?
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
no,
your
honor,
i
think
the
compensation
is
part
of
the
issue.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i'd
still
be
here,
but
certainly
the
compensation
is
part
of
this
issue.
they're
using
public
funds
for
a
religious
service.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
think
so.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
wish
i'd
said
that,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
same
clergyman
every
morning?
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
understand
that.
it
poses
a
problem,
but
it's
not
the
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
we
would
disapprove
of
it.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
we'd
say
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
there
was
prayer
in
the
legislature.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
the
same
religion
every
day?
if
it's
the
same
religion
every
day,
we
think
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
certainly
less
unconstitutional--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--but
in
our
view
still
unconstitutional.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
because
it
still
mixes
religion
with
government.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
because
it
makes
it
less
obvious
that
one
religion
is
singled
out
as
being
the
official
religion.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
don't
think
this
lawsuit
is
asking
this
court
to
take
a
judicial
hammer
and
chisel
and
do
away
with
all
of
the
terms
of
religion,
including
the
opening
ceremony
by
marshal
wong.
that's
not
what
we're
trying
to
do.
i
think
marshal
wong's
ceremonial
opening
has
probably
lost
any
religious
significance
it
may
have
had,
and
marshal
wong
is
not
a
chaplain,
he's
not
a
clergyman.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
we'd
prefer
that
they
didn't.
we
think
that--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--your
honor,
it
seems
to
senator
chambers
that
any
time
you
have
a
prayer
in
the
legislature
it's
probably
unconstitutional.
that
is
mixing
religion
with
government.
senator
chambers'
view
is
very
simple.
he's
elected
to
represent
his
constituents
and
he
is
exposed
to
a
religious
prayer
each
morning
that's
against
his
religious
values
and
he
doesn't
think
he
should
have
to
be
exposed
to
that.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
they
were
certainly
inconsistent,
your
honor,
and
there's
no
question
that
that
matter
was
never
raised
at
that
particular
time.
i
think
there
are
some
unique
distinctions
as
to
the
historical
argument.
this
matter
has
really
never
been
addressed
by
this
court.
it
would
appear
that
that
was
unconstitutional
then,
too.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
no,
your
honor.
this
case
does
not
deal
with--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
it
was
debated.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
at
that
time
they
didn't.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
well,
i
don't
know
that--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--as
to
what
the
first
congress--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--your
honor--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--it's
an
interesting
historical
inquiry,
but
i
think
it's
more
important--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--i
don't
believe
it
has
the
legal...
i
don't
believe
it
has
binding
legal
significance,
justice
white.
i
think
that
our
nation
has
changed
significantly
in
the
past
two
decades...
past
two
centuries,
i
should
say.
and
what
the
framers
did
then
was
not
what
the
nebraska
legislature
is
doing
now.
they
had
a
completely
different
approach
to
the
chaplaincy.
in
the
first
place,
they
rotated
chaplains.
the
chaplains
of
the
house
and
the
senate
were
of
different
denominations,
and
they
weren't
even
officers.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
they
did
pay
them.
three
days
before
they
passed
the
first
amendment
they
voted--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--to
pay
them.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
and
it's
an
inconsistent...
perhaps
one
of
those
inconsistent
things
that's
come
down
through
two
centuries,
and
we
have
never
brought
it
to
this
court
before.
the
court
has
never
had
an
opportunity
to
rule
on
it.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
suspect
that's
what
the
lawsuit's
about,
justice
white.
i
think
the
elements
of
the
nebraska
legislative
prayer
practice
must
be
gone
into
in
some
detail.
the
chaplain,
first
of
all,
is
an
officer
of
the
legislature.
he
is
an
official.
he
may
not
have
a
desk.
i
don't
know
that
he
has
a
desk.
but
he
does
have
a
title.
he's
an
officer.
his
only
function
is
to
deliver
prayer.
he
has
a
uniquely
religious
function.
it's
part
of
the
legislative
day
and
you
open
up
the
legislative
day
with
that
prayer.
the
chaplain
is
compensated.
he
receives
a
salary
each
month.
his
prayers
are
published.
and
perhaps
the
most
problem
here
is
that
the
chaplain
has
inevitably
been
a
christian.
there
is
a
place
in
the
record,
to
answer
justice
marshall's
question,
by
cross-examination
on
senator
lewis,
who
was
chairman
of
the
executive
committee.
and
the
question
was:
"would
you
agree
that
really
the
only
clergy
in
the
history
of
the
legislature--
"
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--yes.
page
69
of
the
joint
appendix,
justice
rehnquist.
"would
you
agree
that
really
the
only
clergy
in
the
history
of
the
legislature
has
always
been
a
christian
clergyman?
"
answer:
"to
my
knowledge,
that's
correct.
"
that's
an
admission
by
the
chairman
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
legislature.
quite
frankly--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
seven
or
ten
years,
something
like
that.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
think
the
fact,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
it's
always
been
a
christian
and
it's
always
been
a
mainstream
protestant
christian.
same
way
with
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
it's
always
been
a
mainstream
protestant
christian.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
other
than
the
fact
that
the
symbolic
inference
here
is
that
one
religion
stands
out,
there
isn't.
this
case
deals
with
symbolism.
i
think
that's
the
crux
of
this
lawsuit
in
many
respects.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
the
record
is
clear
on
that,
your
honor.
senator
chambers
testified
to
that.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
yes,
justice
blackmun.
i'm
trying
to
refer
the
court
to
the
record.
on
page
44
of
the
transcript,
senator
chambers
testified:
"well,
by
the
simple
fact
that
the
legislature,
the
chaplain
is,
and
i
believe
always
has
been,
a
christian,
there
is
some
sort
of,
it
seems
to
me,
some
sort
of
general
tendency
to
approve
of
a
particular
perspective
or
point
of
view
in
religion,
and
perhaps
to
disapprove
of
others.
"
"the
religious
belief
of
the
chaplain
is
probably
representative
of
the
religious
belief
of
the
legislature.
"
and
then
he
goes
on
to
testify
that
that
is
contrary
to
his
own
religious
beliefs
and
has
caused
some
friction
between
senator
chambers
and
the
other
senators
when
he
has
to
get
up
and
he
leaves.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
he
did
not.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
that
was
after
senator
fellman,
a
jewish
senator,
came
up
to
him
and
commented.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
he
devoided
himself
of
the
uniquely
christian
aspect.
but
of
course,
senator
chambers
doesn't
believe
in
god
at
all,
so
the
prayers
themselves
were
offensive
to
him.
they
were
contrary
to
his
spiritual
beliefs,
or
disbeliefs
as
the
case
may
be.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
prayer
in
the
legislature
bothered
him.
i
think
it
should
be
made
clear
right
now
that
this
is
not
an
anti-religious
lawsuit
and
senator
chambers
is
not
questioning
the
right
of
people
to
pray,
only
to
pray
on
the
floor
of
the
legislature.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
of
course
not.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
oh,
i
think
that's
quite
true,
justice
rehnquist.
he
doesn't
have
to
be
there,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
question.
even
in
the
school
prayer
cases,
the
children
didn't
have
to
be
there,
but
nonetheless
they
were
there
and
there
was
certain
peer
pressure.
and
in
this
case
there's
even
a
certain
amount
of
peer
pressure
within
the
members
of
the
legislature.
the
fact
is
that
the
legislative
rule,
although
it's
not
obeyed
to
the
letter,
says
he
must
be
there.
he
must
be
there
for
the
opening
prayer.
and
that
he
finds
constitutionally
offensive.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
we
think
it
would,
your
honor.
but
again,
it's
not--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--the
fact
that
dr.
palmer
is
a
presbyterian?
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
the
fact
that
dr.
palmer
is
a
member
of
a
mainline
protestant
faith
is
not
irrelevant.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
more
than
that.
certainly--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
basically
deals
with
the
protestant
sects
who
have
the
most
members.
i
would
include
in
that
basically
the
lutheran--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--i'm
treading
on
thin
ice,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
basically.
here
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
congressional
history
you
can
find
that
in
the
senate,
for
example,
of
the
62
chaplains
that
they
have
had
since
the
inception
of
the
senate,
about
a
third
of
them
have
been
presbyterian,
a
third
episcopalian,
and
a
third
methodists,
and
a
half
a
dozen
other
assorted
religions.
the
same
thing
goes
with
the
house.
they've
been
basically
those
three
or
four
denominations
that
we've
talked
about.
there
have
never
been
representatives
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
of
the
smaller
religious
sects,
such
as
seventh
day
adventists,
which
is
a
strong
sect
in
lincoln.
there
has
never
been
any
kind
of...
there
has
never
been
any
type
of
representation
of
the
smaller
groups.
there's
never
been
a
jewish
individual,
there's
never
been
a
muslim.
and
i
suppose
the
problem
here
is
really
one
of
symbolism.
that
may
be
the
major
problem
that
we
have
here.
aside
from
the
compensation
issue,
i
think
the
symbolism
issue
is
very
important.
symbolically,
one
individual
who
represents
one
religious
point
of
view
is
inevitably
an
officer
in
that
legislature.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
we
must...
i
think
i
must
stick
with
the
facts
of
the
case
and
the
issue
presented
and
accepted
by
this
court
for
review.
but
i
think
it's
still
a
problem,
even
if
you
had
a
mix,
even
if
you
had
somebody
each
day,
even
if
they
were
not
paid.
but
that's
not
the
issue
that
really
is
before
the
court
and
that's
not
the
issue
that
senator
chambers
is
litigating
at
this
juncture.
but
if
you're
asking
what
senator
chambers'
opinion
is
or
what
my
personal
opinion
is,
i
think
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional.
i
don't
believe
that
you
should
have
any
prayer
in
a
legislative
setting.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
would
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
suppose
that's
the...
that's
the
one
question
i
suppose
that
i
knew
was
going
to
be
asked,
and
the
one
i
have
been
dreading
answering,
i
suspect.
i
don't
suppose
anybody
looks
forward
to
telling
this
court
that
perhaps
the
opening
ceremony
may
be
unconstitutional,
and
i'm
certainly--
[laughter]
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
believe
that
the
opening
ceremony
of
this
court,
as
well
as
the
name
of
god
on
public
buildings
and
god
on
the
currency,
have
lost
all
religious
significance.
senator
chambers
makes
no
issue
about
that.
they
have
been
reduced
to
rote
and
they're
not
religious
at
all.
but
that's
not
the
case
with
the
chaplain's
prayers
in
nebraska.
those
are
definitely
religious
prayers.
they're
constructed
differently
each
day.
they
invoke
the
name
of
god.
most
of
them
invoke
the
name
of
jesus.
they
were
definitely
religious
prayers
and
you
can't
get
around
that.
you
can't
compare--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--yes,
they
do,
justice
powell,
and
we
don't
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
we
feel
that
people
who
are
in
the
military
service
are
taken
away
from
their
normal
place,
they
are
oftentimes
overseas,
and
to
deny
them
some
sort
of
religious
inspiration
would
probably
be
a
violation
of
the
other
part
of
the
clause,
the
free
exercise
clause.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
that
may
be
true,
justice
o'connor,
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
same,
what
we're
talking
about.
and
the
same
with
prison
chaplains.
prison
chaplains
of
course
are
provided.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
i
think--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--i'm
sorry,
justice
powell,
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
think
they
do
have
some
influence,
and
i
guess
the
answer
is
i
don't
know,
either.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
that's
correct,
justice
brennan.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
that's
correct,
chief
justice.
but
i
think
this
case
is
really
a
very
strong
case.
it
probably
goes
to
the
very
outer
limits.
the
nebraska
chaplaincy
is
a
paid
religious
official
doing
a
religious
service
on
the
floor
of
the
legislature,
and
those
other
cases
don't
go
that
far.
even
in
establishment
clauses
cases
that
ruled
against
the
plaintiff,
they
never
had
anything
that
came
close
to
the
factual
pattern
in
this
case.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
justice
o'connor,
at
the
time
of
the
first
congress
i
believe
most
of
the
members
sent
their
children
to
segregated
schools.
at
the
time
of
the
passing
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
1868,
they
all
sent
their
children
to
segregated
schools.
but
times
have
changed.
as
chief
justice
warren
said,
i
believe
it
was...
in
one
case--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--i
think
you
had
something
to
do
with
that
case.
we
can't
turn
the
clock
back
to
1868.
we
simply
must
recognize
the
fact
that
our
civilization
has
changed.
and
our
civilization
has
changed,
justice
o'connor.
it's
changed
completely.
two
centuries
ago
our
forefathers
knew
religious
differences
primarily
among
the
differences
of
protestant
sects.
preparing
for
this
argument
today,
i
went
through
the
washington
telephone
book
and
i
noticed
the
difference
of
the
various
religious
points
of
view
right
here
in
the
nation's
capital.
we
are
a
pluralistic
society.
we
weren't
a
pluralistic
society
two
centuries
ago.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
represents
all
of
the
people.
it
represents
the
muslims
and
the
hindus
and
the
bahais
and
the
jews.
and
unfortunately,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
not
kept
time.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
it
was
not
nearly
as
pluralistic.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
can't
believe
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
today
would
accept
the
practice
in
nebraska.
they
may
have
accepted
it
two
centuries
ago,
but
when
they
looked
at
the
change
of
our
society,
the
change
of
our
culture
today,
i'm
sure
they
would
not
approve
of
this
practice.
in
fact,
james
madison,
who
was
the
drafter
of
the
establishment
clause,
later
in
life
changed
his
mind
and
said
that
it
was
clearly
unconstitutional
from
his
point
of
view.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
think
what
we
have
to
do
is
take--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--that's
correct.
we
think
he
made
a
mistake,
too,
when
he
voted--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--justice
white,
this
matter
really
has
never
had
the
opportunity
to
be
presented
to
this
court.
back
in
1922--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--that's
what
we're
trying
to
do,
justice
white.
and
i
think
one
of
the
problems
is
that
there
was
no
procedural
avenue
to
get
the
matter
to
this
court's
attention
two
centuries
ago.
the
procedural
avenue
is
open
now
through
virtue
of
the
civil
rights
act,
which
is
the
suit...
which
is
the
statute
under
which
this
case
was
filed.
and
we
ask
the
court
to
take
a
strong
look
at
this,
because
symbolically
this
is
extremely
important.
i
think
the
nebraska
practice
hits
square
on
with
the
neutrality
theme
that
this
court
has
always
maintained
in
most
of
the
establishment
clause
cases,
going
through
everson
and
mcgowan,
abbington,
walz
and
epperson.
all
of
the
establishment
clause
cases,
irrespective
of
whether
they
held
for
the
plaintiff
or
for
the
defendant,
the
one
rule
that
this
court
has
always
had
is
that
when
it
comes
to
government,
when
it
comes
to
religion,
government
must
remain
strictly
neutral,
neither
endorsing
or
appearing
to
endorse
one
religion
over
another
or
religion
in
favor
of
non-religion.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
record
in
this
case
supports
the
conclusion
that
one
religion
is
in
fact
better
than
others.
in
the
record,
for
example,
there
is
the
testimony
of
dr.
palmer,
who
said...
would
you
agree
that
by
having
a
uniquely
christian
chaplain
in
the
legislature
it
adds
an
air
of
officialdom
to
the
christian
faith?
and
he
says,
it
could
be
perceived
as
such.
but
the
other
witnesses
also
agreed
to
that.
reverend
stevens,
who
is
a
unitarian
minister,
testified
as
an
expert
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff,
and
he
said
it
certainly
adds
an
air
of
officialdom
to
one
religion.
and
of
course,
senator
chambers
said
the
same
thing.
and
that
probably
is
one
of
the
key
problems
that
we
have
here.
the
whole
concept
of
having
one
religion
that
stands
out
in
a
very
pluralistic
society
seems
to
cause
some
problems.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
that's
correct,
justice
powell.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
circumstantial
evidence
and
symbolic
evidence
only.
i
can't
stand--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--no.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
absolutely
not.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
justice
powell.
and
the
only
thing
i
can
tell
the
court
is
that
this
practice
of
having
one
uniquely
religious
figure
who
belongs
to
one
religion
is
just
like
having
a
small
statute
or
a
small
pennant
on
the
flag
with
a
religious
symbol
on
it.
it
may
be
small,
but
it's
there
and
you
can
see
it
and
everybody
knows
that
it's
there.
and
that's
the
problem
here.
everybody
knows
that
the
officer
of
that
court
or
the
officer
of
the
legislature
is
a
protestant
christian
and
always
has
been,
and
i
submit
always
will
be.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
perceive
it
as
an
establishment
problem.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
think
40
years
ago
in
another
establishment--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--i
can't
prove
that.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
that's
correct,
justice
powell.
i
think--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--i
think
that
a
legal
historian
could
probably
make
a
good
argument
that
one
of
the
reasons
they
called
it
"establishment"
was
that
many
of
the
states
had
their
own
established
churches
at
that
time
and
they
didn't
want
the
federal
government
to
get
involved
in
it.
it
wasn't
until
1940
that
the
establishment
clause
was
held
applicable
to
the
states.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
oh,
i
think
the
whole
state
did.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
he
was
an
official--
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
--oh,
i
think
they
knew
there
was
a
chaplain.
i
don't
think
they
paid
much
attention
to
him,
justice
powell...
justice
marshall.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
i
can't
say
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
herbert
j.
friedman
symbolically,
one
religion
appears
to
dominate
through
government.
a
number
of
years
ago
mr.
orwell
wrote
a
very
poignant
satire
called
"animal
farm"
and
he
penned
the
words:
"all
animals
are
equals,
but
some
are
more
equal
than
others.
"
and
i
suppose
if
one
would
go
to
the
nebraska
legislature
every
legislative
day
during
its
session
or
go
to
congress
every
legislative
day
and
hear
the
opening
ceremony,
one
would
walk
away
with
the
distinct
impression
that
all
religions
may
be
equal
in
this
country,
but
one
is
more
equal
than
others.
we
believe
that
the
eighth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
