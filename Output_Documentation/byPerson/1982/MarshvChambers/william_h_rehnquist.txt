justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you'd
be
here,
but
your
case
wouldn't
be
as
good?
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
friedman?
could
you
tell
us?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
chaplain
make
some
adaptation
to
senator
chambers'
feelings,
though,
after
he
learned
of
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
that
he
omitted
the
reference
to
christ.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
he,
the
chaplain,
did
make
some
adjustment
after
receiving
a
comment
from
another
senator
who
didn't
like
the
christian
aspect
of
the
prayer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
simply
not
only
didn't
believe
in
god,
but
prayer
as
such
bothered
him,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
no
one
requires
him
to
pray.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
friedman,
you've
used
the
term
"mainline
protestant
faith"
a
couple
of
times.
what
do
you
include
within
that
definition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
based
on
a
church
membership
approach?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far,
do
you,
to
make...
to
win
this
case?
i
mean,
certainly
there
could
be
degrees
of
secular
kind
of
absorption
of
something.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
congress
in
1789
had...
represented
and
realized
it
represented
catholic
constituencies,
certainly
some
jews,
some
deists.
weren't
both
jefferson
and
madison
deists?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
to
say
it's
pluralistic
now,
it
was
pluralistic
then,
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
does
that
change
in
degree
really
mean
that
we
can't
accept
the
meaning
that
was
intended
by
the
people
who
drafted
the
amendment
as
applicable
today?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
should
we
take
madison
at
the
time
he
drafted
the
amendment
or
as
he
recanted
many
years
later?
