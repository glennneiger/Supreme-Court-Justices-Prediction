justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
what
the
compensation
was,
how
much
it
was?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
it
is
seven
months,
$320.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
friedman,
would
you
still
be
here,
however,
if
the
compensation
weren't
in
the
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
thought
so.
so
the
compensation
is
irrelevant,
then,
to
this
issue
that's
presented.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
what
you
call
your
members
of
your
unicameral
legislature,
"senator",
all
of
them?
