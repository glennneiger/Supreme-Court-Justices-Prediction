justice
byron
r.
white
how
was
his
appointment...
how
often
was
his
appointment
made,
did
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
for
every...
is
he
reappointed
every
session?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
who
designates
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
one
of
the
early...
is
that
one
of
the
first
things
a
new
session
does,
is
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--does
he,
does
the
chaplain,
have
an
office?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
just
comes
in
every
morning--
justice
byron
r.
white
--for
a
few
minutes?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
has
no
place
to
hang
his
hat?
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me.
do
you
know
whether
anybody
else
has
ever
applied
to
be
the
chaplain?
have
there
been
lots
of...
down
through
the
years,
has
every
session...
have
there
been
several
every
session
who
are
applying,
and
they've
always
chosen
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
would
also
be
here
even
if
they
changed
chaplains
every
session?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wasn't
there
opposition
to
the
prayer
in
the
first
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
it
was
brought
to
it...
it
was
put
on
the
table,
but
that
was
just
by
a
minority.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
the
people
who
raised
it
didn't
prevail.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
then
the...
do
you
think
that
congress
would
have,
if
it
thought
the
first
amendment
barred
that,
would
have
continued
having
prayer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
a
pretty
decent
inquiry,
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
wonder,
isn't
it
a
relevant
inquiry
as
to
what
the
framers
intended?
justice
byron
r.
white
none
of
it...
it
has
no
legal
significance?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
paid
them,
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
pay
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's...
you're
just
assuming
it's
inconsistent.
it
may
not
be
at
all.
that's
what
the
lawsuit's
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn't
that
just
mean
"as
far
as
i
know"?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
long
has
he
been
in
the
legislature,
seven
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
he
said
is
that
he
had
made
a
mistake.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
like
saying,
well,
i
know
the
first
amendment
means
so-and-so
but
i
wish
it
meant
it
something
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
the
opportunity
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
an
establishment,
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
the...
well,
you
have
to
say
that
that
is
the
establishment,
like
the
symbol
on
the
flag.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
the
establishment,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
take
that
position
or
else
you'll
have
to
then
prove
that
that
symbol
on
the
flag
or
the
symbol
before
the
legislature
had
some
real
consequences,
which
you
don't
care
to
undertake
to
prove.
