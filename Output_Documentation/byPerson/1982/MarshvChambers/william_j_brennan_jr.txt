well,
in
any
event,
mr.
friedman,
i
gather
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
in
the
case
of
the
military
chaplain
or
the
prison
chaplain
there's
a
tension
between
the
free
exercise
and
the
establishment
clauses,
and
the
free
exercise
clause
in
this
instance,
and
the
interests,
override
the
establishment
complications.
