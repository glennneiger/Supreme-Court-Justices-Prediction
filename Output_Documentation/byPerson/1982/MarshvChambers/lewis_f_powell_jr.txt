f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
friedman,
do
military
units
still
have
chaplains?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
you
have
a
military
unit
stationed
at
some
foreign
post,
remote
generally
from
other
people,
are
you
suggesting
the
chaplain
has
no
opportunity
to
influence
them?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
said,
military
units
are
stationed
all
over
the
world
and
they're
often
quite
isolated.
you
are
suggesting
that
it's
not
appropriate
for
a
chaplain
to
have
an
opportunity,
by
example
or
otherwise,
to
influence
other
people.
do
you
think
the
chaplain
has
no
influence
whatever
in
a
military
unit?
i
don't
know.
i'm
asking
your
opinion.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
friedman,
you
have
to
support
the
position,
don't
you,
that
the
primary
effect
of
what
has
been
done
in
the
legislature
is
to
promote
the
establishment
of
religion?
do
you
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
evidence
is
there
of
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
circumstantial
evidence?
have
the
number
of
mainline
protestant
churches
increased
since
1955
in
nebraska?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
have
the
number
of
parishioners
in
protestant
churches?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
in
what
way
has
any
establishment
of
religion
been
enhanced
or
furthered?
establishment,
now.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this.
was
that
the
type
of
establishment
that
the
framers
had
in
mind
when
they
included
the
establishment
clause
in
the
bill
of
rights?
they
were
thinking
about
what
had
happened,
indeed,
to
many
of
them
and
to
their
ancestors
in
western
europe.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there
you
had
a
true
establishment,
that
the
church
and
state
were
essentially
the
same.
