justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cronk,
is
there
evidence
in
the
record
that
chaplain
palmer
ever
refused
to
allow
any
guest
chaplain
to
appear?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
record
disclose
when
the
prayers
were
recited
and
at
what
point
in
the
orders
of
the
day
that
that
practice
occurred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
friedman,
is
there
any
evidence,
apart
from
the
symbolic
evidence
that
you
just
referred
to,
that
the
tenure
of
reverend
palmer
has
had
the
purpose
or
the
effect
of
favoring
one
particular
religious
viewpoint?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
i
was
asking
was,
is
there
anything
other
than
that
rather
symbolic
evidence
to
demonstrate
that
a
particular
religious
viewpoint
was
being
advocated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
you
also
address
exactly
what
effects
the
practice
in
nebraska
has
had
on
senator
chambers
with
some
precision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
think
legislators
are
called
away
from
their
home
counties
and
are
in
need
of
some
guidance
and
inspiration
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
mr.
friedman,
that
comes
back,
of
course,
to
the
practice
of
congress
and
the
practice
in
congress
at
the
formation
of
this
nation
and
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
first
amendment.
