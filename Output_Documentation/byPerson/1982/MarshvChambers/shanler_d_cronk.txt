mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
matter
is
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
derived
from
an
action
brought
by
respondent,
a
member
of
the
nebraska
legislature,
over
three
years
ago
by
which
he
sought
to
challenge
the
legislature's
traditional
method
of
opening
each
legislative
day's
sitting
with
a
brief
invocation
offered
by
a
cleric
chaplain,
a
non-legislator
officer
of
the
legislature.
the
basis
of
that
challenge
was
that
legislative
prayers
employed
by
the
legislature
in
that
manner
per
se
violated
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
senator
chambers'
precise
claim
was
that
the
prayers,
apparently
definitionally
being
a
per
se
violation
of
the
constitution,
by
practical
operation
obviated
the
necessity
for
compensating
anyone
to
provide
them,
obviated
the
necessity
obviously,
again,
from
practical
considerations
of
even
having
a
prayer
book,
and
in
that
way
the
compensation
of
the
chaplain
would
fall.
it's
pretty
clear
from
the
record
that
his
case
focused
exclusively
on
the
proposition
that
prayers,
at
least
the
prayers
offered
by
the
then
chaplain,
the
only
ones
that
we
have
any
evidence
of
in
the
record,
themselves
violated
the
constitution,
so
obviously
we
now
would
have
no
reason
to
compensate
anybody
to
give
them,
at
least
reverend
palmer.
i
do
not
believe
and
i
do
not
think
the
record
reflects
any
independent
basis
for
invalidating
the
compensation
of
the
chaplain,
and
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
realized
somewhat
of
an
incongruity
in
declining
to
rule
the
legislative
prayers
per
se
unconstitutional
and
at
the
same
time
finding
a
fault
with
their
compensation,
in
the
absence
of
any
independent
basis.
i
think
it
is
pretty
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
attempted
to
link
the
compensation
problem
with
the
tenure
of
chaplain
palmer.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
it
changed
from
time
to
time.
at
the
time
of
filing
the
action,
it
was
approximately
$320
per
month.
the
legislature
sits
in
biannual
sessions,
the
first
year
four
months,
the
second
year
three
months.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
roughly,
seven
months
per
two-year
session.
as
i
mentioned,
i
think
it
is
pretty
clear
from
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
the
per
se
challenge
initiated
by
the
respondent
was
rejected
by
the
court
and
instead,
surprising
in
view
of
the
case
that
was
presented
at
trial,
the
court
of
appeals
singled
out
principally
an
additional
factor,
and
that
was
the
retention
and
compensation
of
a
particular
chaplain
for
an
extended
period
of
time,
without
any
indication
of
what
constituted
an
extended
period
of
time.
we
are
to
conclude
from
the
opinion
that
16
years
at
least
is
such
an
extended
period
of
time.
there
are
some
particular
facts
in
the
record
that
should
be
briefly
alluded
to
because
they
bear
directly
on
what
facts
and
circumstances
at
all
appear
in
the
record
relevant
to
that
basis
for
the
court's
decision.
the
chaplaincy
practice
has
existed
in
nebraska
since
1855,
12
years
before
statehood.
at
the
time
of
filing
the
action,
the
chaplain,
along
with
three
other
non-legislator
traditional
officers,
the
other
three
being
the
clerk,
the
assistant
clerk
and
the
sergeant
at
arms,
were
recommended
at
the
beginning
of
each
biannual
session
by
the
legislature's
executive
board,
its
administrative
oversight
body,
for
the
legislature's
full
approval.
these
individuals
were
essentially
treated
as
employees
of
the
legislature.
they
were
compensated
as
part
of
the
usual
process
by
which
the
legislature
compensated
its
employees.
and
the
evidence
i
think
is
quite
clear,
although
it's
not
overly
abundant,
that
the
legislature
itself
had
never
considered
over
the
course
of
time
the
post
of
chaplain
or
any
particular
individual's
retention
as
chaplain
as
an
issue
of
substantive
importance
in
the
legislative
process.
we
have
not
one
hint
of
any
controversy,
of
any
complaint,
any
concern
about
either
the
post
of
chaplain
or
any
particular
chaplain
whatsoever
prior
to
the
time
that
respondent,
as
a
member
of
the
executive
board
in
1979,
attempted
to
get
that
body
to
recommend
that
the
post
be
totally
eliminated
and,
as
he
put
it,
failing
that
at
least
compensation.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
we
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
we
know
about--
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
--no,
i
don't
believe
it
was,
your
honor.
we
never
had
any
evidence
at
all
in
the
record
about
the
denominational
affiliations,
even
the
identities,
of
any
chaplains
prior
to
palmer.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
on
three
occasions
during
chaplain--
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
--certain
of
them
are.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
i
believe
there
are
prayers
that
make
reference
to
deity
identifiable
to
the
judaeo-christian
heritage,
as
chaplain
palmer
put
it.
there
are
certain
prayers
that
expressly
mention
jesus
christ.
i
think
the
record
reflects
roughly
half,
a
little
less
than
half
of
the
prayers,
in
addition
to
making
reference
to
deity,
that
might
be
identified
in
the
judaeo-christian
heritage,
do
mention
jesus
christ.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
don't
admit
what,
your
honor?
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
we
simply
have
no
idea,
your
honor.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
absolutely
none.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
the
only
thing
we
know
about
any
prior
chaplain
is
that
chaplain
palmer
himself
became
a
candidate
for
the
post
because
of
the
death
of
his
predecessor
in
office.
one
of
the
important
facts
relevant
to
the
court
of
appeals'
basis
for
this
conclusion
is
simply
the
fact
that
over
the
entire
some
130
year
history
of
the
nebraska
chaplaincy,
in
keeping
with
the
fact
that
the
legislative
post
and
any
particular
individual
had
never
caused
any
concern
from
the
public
or
from
the
legislature,
the
practice
developed
that
the
chaplain,
as
well
as
the
other
non-legislator
traditional
officers,
would
be
reappointed.
both
respondent
senator
chambers
and
executive
board
chairman
lewis
indicated
that
it
simply
was
the
common
practice
that
the
four
incumbents
to
the
office
would
be
slated
again,
unless
there
was
an
objection
from
somebody.
all
that
was
needed
in
order
to
have
the
executive
board
recommend
an
incumbent
for
an
ensuing
session
of
the
legislature
was
a
five
to
four
vote.
there
simply
had
never
been
any
objection
to
that
process,
which
i
think
is
reflective
of
the
fact
that
it
had
never
engendered
any
controversy
or
concern
whatsoever
up
to
this
point,
up
to
the
filing
of
the
action.
chaplain
palmer,
who
has
served
since
1965,
clearly
indicated
that
he
became
a
candidate
for
the
vacancy
at
that
time
as
an
individual,
not
as
a
representative
of
his
church.
his
church
allows
him
to
become
involved
in
civic
activities
to
the
extent
his
time
permits.
it's
in
that
capacity
that
he
has
served.
the
only
evidence
that
is
in
the
record
concerning
chaplain
palmer's
own
individual
retention
comes
from
the
executive
board
chairman,
frank
lewis,
who
had
been
a
member
of
the
legislature
since
1972
and
was
chairman
of
the
executive
board
at
time
of
trial
in
1979,
that
palmer
had
simply
been
reappointed
because
he
had
done
a
good
job,
very
much
consistent
with
what
the
usual
process
was.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
such
refusal.
in
fact,
the
record
makes
quite
clear
that
on
frequent
occasion
he
solicited
clergypersons
of
other
denominations
to
fill
in
for
him.
it
was
frequently
the
occasion
that
a
member
of
the
legislature,
because
of
a
special
occasion,
the
death
of
a
friend
or
what-not,
would
suggest
that
a
particular
chaplain
fill
in.
no
such
request
was
ever
denied.
chaplain
palmer
indicated
there
were
other
denominations
and
religions
represented,
mentioning
clerics
of
the
jewish
faith
in
particular.
i
might
add--
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
--the
record
does,
your
honor.
the
prayer
was
essentially
the
first
step
beginning
each
legislative
day's
sitting.
the
legislature
typically
was
called
to
order
at
9:00
in
the
morning,
sometimes
10:00.
that
would
be
the
first
matter
of
business,
depending
on
when
each
day's
starting
time
was
scheduled.
the
petitioners
have
always
maintained
that,
on
the
basis
of
this
particular
record
and
on
the
basis
of
any
record
that
could
have
been
developed
by
any
different
approach
to
this
establishment
clause
challenge
to
the
legislative
practice,
that
it
stands
in
its
entirety,
and
is
not
changed
by
specific
analysis
on
any
one
of
its
several
components,
as
essentially
a
tradition
of
the
legislature,
more
steeped
in
ceremony
than
actually
any
substantive
import,
by
which
the
legislature
has
sought
to
begin
each
day's
business
in
a
solemn
tone,
hopefully
setting
an
attitude
of
high
purpose,
although
chaplain
palmer
quite
readily
admits
that
he
would
be
hard
pressed
to
admit
that
happens
on
all
occasions.
and
the
fact
that
chaplain
palmer
has
served
in
his
post
does
not
change
that
fact,
the
fact
that
he
served
for
some
16
years.
fundamental,
we
believe,
in
this
analysis
is
recognition
of
several
historical
considerations
which
clearly
are
relevant
because
of
the
fact
that
legislative
chaplaincies
substantially,
if
not
virtually,
identical
to
that
in
nebraska
have
a
rich
history
in
our
national
heritage.
i
think
the
importance
with
regard
to
certain
activities
that
are
interpreted
under
the
religion
clauses
today
that
have
such
a
history,
of
an
investigation
into
that
history
and
of
a
taking
into
account
in
the
establishment
clause
analysis
of
that
history,
has
been
clearly
indicated
by
this
court
in
cases
such
as
walz
versus
maryland...
walz
versus
tax
commissioner
and
mcgowan
versus
maryland.
and
i
believe
the
factors
that
were
singled
out
there
and
that
played
a
substantial
part
in
the
decisions
in
those
courts
are
also
existent
here
and
were
totally
ignored
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
fundamentally
flawed
its
analysis.
we
do
have
the
benefit
of
examining
an
activity
today
that
not
only
existed
at
the
time
the
framers
were
drafting
the
first
amendment,
but
was
actually
practiced
by
them
at
the
very
time
the
first
amendment
was
drafted.
the
existence
of
evidence
contemporaneous
with
the
drafting
of
any
particular
amendment
which
we
are
today
attempting
to
interpret
was
recently
underscored
by
this
court
in
the
minneapolis
star
and
tribune
case.
i
think
the
record
before
the
court
quite
convincingly
indicates
that
three
days
before
the
final
wording
of
the
first
amendment
was
settled
on,
including
the
religion
clauses,
the
very
same
framers
enacted
legislation
compensating
the
officers
of
both
of
their
houses,
including
chaplains.
even
some
15
years
prior
to
that
time,
the
first
continental
congress
employed
or
utilized
a
cleric
to
begin
its
legislative
sessions.
he
was
compensated
at
the
end
of
his
tenure
and
his
tenure
was
for
a
number
of
years.
subsequent
to
the
drafting
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
convening
of
the
first
congress
under
the
constitution,
the
federal
practice
has
been
virtually
identical
to
that
that
has
been
employed
in
nebraska.
equally
important
is
the
fact
that
the
same
activity,
the
same
practice
in
substantially
identical
form,
has
enjoyed
widespread
acceptance
throughout
the
states.
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
national
conference
of
state
legislatures
reaffirms
what
had
previously
been
noted
in
the
decisions
of
a
few
courts
construing
cases
such
as
this,
that
legislative
bodies
in
every
state
traditionally
have
opened
their
legislative
daily
sessions
with
prayer,
that
over
half
of
them
have
compensated
the
individuals
performing
that
service,
and--
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
--i
think
the
record
indicates
that
his
only
service
is
the
provision
of
the
morning
prayer,
and
that's
provided
for
by
legislative
rule.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
this
is
true.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
it's
difficult
to
assess
whether
the
result
would
be
the
same
in
any
particular
situation,
because
this,
like
most
establishment
clause
cases,
has
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
its
own
facts
and
circumstances.
we
would
simply
have
to
know,
we
would
have
to
inquire,
we
would
have
to
find
out,
what
the
reason
for
requiring--
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
--it
doesn't
strike
me
that
we
necessarily
would
conclude
that
that,
such
a
practice,
moves
us
more
toward
the
impermissible.
but
there
could
be
a
number
of
explanations
for
why
such
a
requirement
would
ever
be
evolved
in
a
particular
legislature,
just
as
there
could
be
a
number
of
explanations
as
to
why
specific
state
legislatures
employ
legislative
prayer
practices
or
retain
particular
individuals.
what
we
know
here
is
that
there
is
nothing
inform
in
the
way
that
the
nebraska
legislature
has
done
so
over
the
past
100
years.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
i
think
that
that
moves
us
more
toward...
the
suggestion
in
your
question
is
that
that
singles
out
a
particular
denomination
officially.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
i
think
that
that
would
cause
more
problem
than
has
been
caused
by
this
situation
that
we
actually
have
before
us.
i
think
clearly
it
would
be
good
cause
for
an
inquiry
as
to
what
the
purpose
for
the
requirement
was.
all
that
we
know
now...
and
it
draws
back
to
the
unique
circumstances
of
this
case...
all
that
we
know
now
is
that
chaplain
palmer
was
retained
simply
because
he
did
a
good
job,
considered
as
a
traditional,
relatively
unimportant
ceremonial
functionary
of
the
legislature.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
the
sessions,
the
actual
process,
is
every
two
years.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
every
two-year
session.
so
at
the
time
of
trial
it
was
14,
he
would
have
been
in
his
sixth
or
seventh
reappointment.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
the
executive
board
recommends
to
the
full
legislature
for
approval.
that
approval
has
essentially
been
a
rubber
stamp.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
the
executive
board?
that's
not
clear.
in
fact,
it's
not
clear...
well,
the
session
begins
the
first
of
the
year,
i
believe,
about
the
second
or
third
week
in
january.
so
this
action
has
to
be
taken
by
the
executive
board
prior
thereto,
within
a
reasonable
amount
of
time.
and
i
would
presume
that
selecting
the
officers
is
one
of
the
first
orders
of
business.
the
provision
that
requires
the
selection
of
these
officers
is
the--
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
--no,
he
does
not.
he
travels--
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
--yes.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
yes.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
as
far
as
i
know,
and
the
record
is
silent
on
whether
that's
the
case.
my
personal
knowledge
is
that
he
does
not.
in
fact,
i
believe
it
can
be
gathered
from
his
testimony.
he
indicated
that
he
usually
prepares
the
prayers
in
his
church
before
getting
in
the
morning
to
the
legislature
to
give
them.
this
court
i
think
is
aware
that
in
attempting
to
define
the
limits
of
the
permissible
accommodation--
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
--we
don't
know.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
in
1979
there
was
some
confusion
between
the
outgoing
executive
board
and
the
incoming
executive
board
prior
to
the
session
that
began
in
january
of
1980
as
to
which
board
was
to
select
or
to
recommend
the
officers.
as
to
how
frequently
clerics
apply,
if
they
even
apply
at
all,
the
record
is
simply
silent.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
i
have
been
asking
myself
the
same
question,
your
honor.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
the
record
says
nothing
about
the
denominational
affiliation
of
any
other
chaplain
except
reverend
palmer.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
there
is
an
indication
that
in
1979
the
outgoing
executive
board
recommended
another
cleric--
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
--denomination
unknown.
the
new
incoming
board,
feeling
that
it
was
authorized
or
not
knowing
that
the
outgoing
board
had
already
taken
the
action,
recommended
chaplain
palmer.
when
that
inconsistency
was
brought
to
a
head,
the
confusion
was
cleared
up
on
the
floor
of
the
legislature.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
i
wish
i
knew
for
certain.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
the
plaintiff,
respondent
here,
challenged
the
expenditure
of
state
funds
for
the
prayer
book.
he
specifically
requested
relief
that
the
expenditure
of
funds
be
enjoined.
the
district
court
judgment
i
believe
purports
to
enjoin
not
only
the
expenditure
of
funds
but
the
printing
of
the
prayer
book.
being
of
the
view
that
the
printing
of
the
prayer
book
has
never
been
an
official
part
of
the
legislative
chaplaincy
anyway,
that
matter
was
not
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
been
of
that
view
for
the
reason
that
in
three
years
during
the
latter
portion
of
dr.
palmer's
tenure
individuals
on
the
floor
of
the
legislature,
not
pursuant
to
any
legislative
rules,
apparently
toward
the
end
of
the
session
got
up
and
said:
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
maybe
we
had
some
of
these
printed
up
for
our
own
use.
it
is
indicated
on
page
32
or
33
of
reverend
palmer's
deposition,
exhibit
5
on
the
record,
that
the
request
was
that
these
books
be
prepared
for
the
legislators'
use.
apparently
some
of
them
felt
that
it
had
been
somewhat
inspirational
and
they
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
have
copies
of
the
thing.
evidence
of
the
fact
that
it
was
intended
primarily
for
their
use
is
quite
clear
from
the
print
runs
of
the
book.
the
1970
book,
there
were
100
copies
that
have
been
made.
this
chain
of
events
at
the
time
the
action
was
filed
was
not
at
all
guaranteed
to
occur
in
the
future.
we
had
no
idea
whether
anybody
was
going
to
get
up
and
order
that
or
not.
it
simply
wasn't,
a
part
of
this
case
as
we
viewed
it,
and
for
that
reason
we
didn't
appeal
it.
because
the
court
of
appeals
changed
the
analysis
that
the
district
court
had
undertaken
and
insisted
that
it
had
to
consider
the
challenge
against
something
called
a
prayer
practice
in
its
entirety,
whatever
the
court
meant
by
that,
the
prayer
book
issue
was
kind
of
dragged
back
into
the
fray.
our
position
is
that
it
is
distinct
from
the
legislative
chaplaincy,
it
is
distinct
from
the
principal
controlling
factor
by
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case,
but
even
if
it
is
considered
on
its
merits,
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
wrong
to
the
extent
that
their
decisions
stand
as
a
judgment
that
on
an
independent
analysis
those
prayer
books
transcend
the
establishment
clause.
i
think
that
the
record,
portions
of
the
record
i
have
just
cited,
indicate
there
was
a
secular
enough
purpose
for
them.
to
say
that
100
of
these
books
given
to
the
legislators
for
their
own
personal
use
amounts
to
a
direct
and
immediate
effect
advancing
religion,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
were
a
few
odd
copies
left
over
and
somebody
among
the
public
found
out
about
it
and
requested
it
and
they
were
given
to
them,
we
think
stretches
the
meaning
of
the
primary
effect
test.
i
think
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honors.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
just
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
there's
one
thing
that
the
court
should
have
pounded
into
the
heads
of
anybody
attempting
to
discern
the
proper
establishment
clause
analysis,
it
is
that
these
are
very
difficult
cases
and
they
depend
essentially
on
facts
and
circumstances.
and
if
there's
one
thing
that
is
conspicuous
about
the
symbolic
argument
that
is
now
advanced
by
the
petitioners,
and
that
seems
to
be
essentially
the
core
of
their
position,
it's
that
there
is
not
the
slightest
shred
of
evidence
to
support
it
in
the
record.
and
there's
a
reason
for
that.
this
case
started
out
essentially
championing
the
proposition
that
prayers
per
se
violate
the
constitution.
the
tenure
of
a
particular
chaplain,
the
identity
of
chaplain
palmer
by
denomination,
played
no
part
in
the
trial
of
this
case.
that's
the
reason
that
the
record
is
absolutely
devoid
of
any
relevance
on
this
particular
question.
the
tenure,
even
the
compensation,
were
not
even
listed
in
the
pretrial
order
as
controverted
issues.
if
there's
any
merit
at
all
in
the
symbolic
argument,
this
is
not
the
record
that
can
support
it.
this
case
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
the--
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
--no,
i
wouldn't
take
that
blanket
position,
your
honor.
i
think
clearly
the
court--
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
--i
think
inquiring
as
to
the
impact,
attempting
to
determine
some
evidence
as
to
what's
going
on
out
there,
clearly
would
be
in
order.
that
clearly
didn't
happen
here,
because
this
was
not
the
essence
of
the
case.
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are--
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
--well,
i
would
have
to
know
a
little
bit
about--
mr.
shanler
d.
cronk
--absolutely
not.
that
some
practices
might
manifest
some
identification
with
a
particular
religion
or
a
particular
religious
view
is
clear.
the
question
is,
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
does
that
really
advance
religion
in
the
manner
that
the
court
has
attempted
to
explain
for
us
as
is
contemplated
by
the
establishment
clause.
the
reason
that
we
don't
have
a
leg
up
in
answering
that
question
here
is
because
this
case,
this
record,
was
never
tailored
to
address
this
question.
