justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
garvey,
was
this
the
first
time
that
the
government
had
brought
such
an
action
against
claimant
or
user
of
gravel
under
the
farmers
and
stockmen's
act...
stockmen's
homestead
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
until
when?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
a
lot
of
holders
of
land
patented
under
the
stock
raisers
act
simply
go
ahead
and
use
the
gravel,
or
have
in
the
past,
on
the
assumption
that
it's
not
a
mineral.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
so
far
as
you
know,
from
the
time
of
1916,
when
the
stock
raisers
act
was
passed,
until
the
bringing
of
this
action
was
the
first
time
the
government
had
ever
brought
an
action
in
court
asserting
that
it
retained
title
to
gravel
because
it
was
a
reserved
mineral
under
the
stock
raisers
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
has
the
federal
mining
law
ever
treated
something
that
was
arguably
a
mineral
as
a
mineral
when
it's
found
commercially
but
not
a
mineral
when
it's
not
found
or
used
commercially?
well,
you
can't
even
get
a...
you
can't
patent
your
mining
claim
unless
it's
a
commercial
deposit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
that...
that
depends
on
whether
you
can
properly
locate.
that
doesn't...
the
definition
of
mineral
has
never
turned
on
whether
something--
--no,
no.
--was
commercially
used.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
under
the
1906
act,
or
16
act,
there
certainly
have
been
numerous
instances,
have
there
not,
of
entries
by
private
individuals
on
land
that
was
open...
but
where
the
subsurface
was
open
to
entry
who
proposed
to
become
mineral
claimants?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there
as
in
other
branches
of
the
mineral,
i
have
never
known
of
a
court
case
that
said
the
definition
of
a
mineral
turns
on
the
degree
to
which
it's
commercially
used.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
your
contention
that
the
reservation
of
minerals
under
the
1916
act
included
all
gravel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
am
interested
in
reaching
it
right
now
by
a
yes-or-no
answer
from
you,
if
i
could.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
why
do
you
say
one
is
"disposable"
under
the
mineral
act
and
the
other
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
how
can
you
refer
to
a
consistent
interpretation
when
you
have
the
gravel
opinion
sometime
in
the
early
teens,
i
think
it
was,
and
then
the
turnabout
in
1929?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
congress
intended
a
different
definition
of
mineral
in
the
stock
raisers
act
than
it
did
in
the
mining
act
of
1872?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can't
you
answer
any
question
yes
or
no,
counsel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
kind
of
like
a
springing
use?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
with
each
time
a
stockyard
patentee
comes
across
any
trace
of
coal
on
his
land,
he's
got
to
wonder
whether
it
belongs
to
the
government
or
belongs
to
him,
and
he's
got
to
make
a
judgment
whether
it's,
quote,
commercially
valuable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
layman
decision
the
kind
that
would
not
be
expected
to
be
judicially
tested
itself
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
since
it's
a
decision
granting
an
application
for
a
mineral
patent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
agricultural
entry
man
could
have
appealed
it
as
well
as
the
mineral
claimant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
mr.
garvey,
was
the
government's
statement
there
made
in
the
connection
with
an
oral
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
a
stipulation
as
to
the
fact
of
whether
or
not
there
was
commercial
gravel
involved,
commercially
usable
gravel?
