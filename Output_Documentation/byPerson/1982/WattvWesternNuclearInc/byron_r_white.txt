justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
the
government's
position
narrow,
that
that...
that
on
these,
where
the
government
reserves
minerals
on
this
kind
of
land,
that
it's
a
trespass
for
the
rancher
or
owner
to
use
any
gravel?
i
thought
you
were
now
limiting--
justice
byron
r.
white
--your
claim
to
commercial
deposits.
justice
byron
r.
white
so...
so
anyway,
you...
whenever
you
made
your
position
clear,
it
is
now
your
position
at
least
that
the...
it's
only
commercial
deposits
that
is
at
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
mean
commercial
use.
suppose
it's
a
commercial
deposit.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
not
commercially.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
there
are
a
lot
of
noncommercial
deposits
of
gravel
around,
and
the...
certainly,
you
concede
that
the
rancher's
or
homesteader's
use
of
that
gravel
is
permissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
doesn't
even
belong
to
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
already
answered
it
once,
and
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that,
zimmerman
was
on
the
books
when
that
was
passed.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
owns
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
proposed
by--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
take
it
your
argument
is
that...
that
congress
necessarily
had
in
mind
the
zimmerman
decision.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
the...
didn't
the
secretary
have
some
regulatory
authority
under
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
stock-raising...
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
he
have
any...
i
suppose
by
adjudication
he
would--
justice
byron
r.
white
--he
would
certainly
have
some
authority
to
say
what
a
mineral
was
or
wasn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
any...
that
any...
any
interpretation,
anything
that
the
department
of
interior
had
called
a
mineral
or
had
said
was
not
a
mineral,
any
of
those
decisions
were
automatically
cut
in...
put
in
granite
by
the...
by
the
1916
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
could
never
be
another
decision
by
the
land...
in
the
land
department
that
was
contrary
to
any
prior
decision
adopted
before
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
no;
i
mean
it
would
be
they
would...
they
should
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--right.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
as
a
matter
of
law
layman
was
just
wrong
or
that
they...
the
tribunal
was
without
authority
to
decide
that
way
because...
because
zimmerman...
that
zimmerman
was
beyond
reach?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
were
without
authority
to
overrule
zimmerman.
that's
what
your
submission
is,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
it
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
strange
that...
that
there
would
be
this
difference
of
opinion
between
you
two
on
whether
gravel
was
locatable
prior
to
layman.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
just
a
matter
of...
is
it
just
a
matter
of
opinion?
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
matter
of
experience.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does...
did
gravel
ever?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
to
your
knowledge
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
did
zimmerman
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
zimmerman
is
evidence
that
gravel
was
not
locatable?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
when
is
the
first
time
that
the
government
began
to
issue
patents
under
the
mining
claims
laws
for
common
varieties
of
commercially
salable
gravel?
when
did
the
government--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
shaver,
you
say
that
the
government
has
come
full
circle.
it
may
have
done
it
twice.
but
since
layman
at
least
they
have
considered
gravel
to
be
locatable
as
a
mineral.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
any
of
the
legislation
that
took
place
changed
that,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
in
the
sense
that
it
certainly
never...
never
said
that
gravel
could
never
be
locatable
as
a
mineral?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no,
but
common...
common
varieties
of
gravel,
whatever
you
want
to
call
them--
justice
byron
r.
white
--were
locatable
as
as
mineral
under
layman?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
has
never
been
any
legislation
that
indicates
that
common
varieties
of
gravel
can
never
be
locatable
as
a
mineral?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly
there
is
many
ways
of
disposing
of
property
other
than
through
the
mining
laws.
they
may
want
to
dispose
of
them
by
a
less
complicated
technique
or
a
more
complicated
technique,
for
all
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
could
congress
believe
that
if
they
knew
about
layman?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
layman
was
just
a
derelict?
it
overruled
zimmerman.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
the...
it
represented
the
view
of
the
authorities
that
were
administering
the
relevant
laws.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
because
they
weren't
mineral?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
