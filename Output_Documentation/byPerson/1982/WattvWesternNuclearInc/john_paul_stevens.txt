mr.
garvey,
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
gravel,
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
rehnquist's
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
answer
it
yes
or
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
they
do
reserve
it
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
while
you
pause.
as
i
understand
it,
the
government's
view
is
that
although
it
will
only
assert
a
trespass
claim
when
the
gravel
has
commercial
value,
in
fact
it
retains
an
interest
in
gravel
that
does
not
have
commercial
value?
that's
correct,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
what
i
thought
your
yes
answer
indicated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
what
they
assert
an
interest
in
in
this
case.
it's
commercial,
you
say
there's
commercial
value
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
interested
in
physically
identical
gravel
in
which
there
is
no
commercial--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
does
not.
does
it
acknowledge
it
does
not
have
an
ownership
interest
in
such
gravel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
in
other
words,
the
farmer,
the
rancher
can
use
it
for
whatever
he
wants
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
loses
his
ownership
as
soon
as
it
acquires
commercial
value?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
his...
the
title
to
that
gravel
is...
fluctuates
as
economic
conditions
fluctuate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
physical
limit
on
this
concept?
now
supposing
we
have
black
dirt
rather
than
gravel,
which
one
could
say
is
a
mineral
in
some
sort
of
sense,
and
also
might
sometimes
be
used
by
the
landowner
and
sometimes
be
sold?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
sand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
quality...
would
the
character
of
sand
also
turn
on
its
economic
or
the
economic
conditions
just
like
gravel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
other,
other
than
gravel
or
sand
in
which
there
is
this
kind
of
springing
use?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
about
coal.
doesn't
the
government
hold
coal
even
when
it
has
no
commercial
value?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
aren't
asking
you
whether
the
owner
could
use
it.
i
am
asking
you
whether
as
a
matter
of
legal
theory
you
think
the
government
has
an
ownership
interest.
assume
there
is
aluminum
in
the
soil.
would
you
say
that
the
government
does
not
have
an
ownership
interest
in
the
aluminum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
question
that.
the
literal
language
reserves
to
the
united
states
all
the
coal,
but
you
say
that
doesn't
really
mean
all
the
coal,
it
only
means
all
the
commercially
valuable
coal.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shaver,
how
many
cases
in
the...
like
layman
have
there
been?
do
we
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
i
mean
it
was...
was
layman
followed
repeatedly
at
the
administrative
level?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
do
you
attach
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
the
original
grant
in
this
case
was
in
1926,
3
years
before
the
layman
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't?
