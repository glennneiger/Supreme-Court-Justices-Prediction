is
that
your
so-called
free-use
theory,
or
is
that
something
else?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
those,
your
position
is
that
the
patent
owner
can
make
free
use
of
the
commercially
valuable
minerals?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
subsequent
patent
owners;
for
instance,
someone
who
now
has
a
hotel
on
the
premises?
justice

o'connor
mr.
shaver,
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general,
however,
that
under
the
1872
mineral
location
act
that
valuable,
commercially
valuable,
gravel
deposits
could
have
been
located
under
that
act
even
at
the
time
of
zimmerman?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
it
has
been
some
years
now
that
that's
been
the
practice
of
the
federal
government,
the
department
of
the
interior,
to
issue
patents
on
common
varieties
of
gravel;
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
the
mining
location?
justice
sandra

o'connor
in
1955.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when
it
went
to
its
sale.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
fact...
i
mean
you
have
to
recognize
that
in
1955
congress
took
the
action
it
did
because
the
department
of
the
interior
had
been
patenting
land
for
common
varieties
of
gravel,
had
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
why
they
passed
the
'55
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
gravel
involved
in
this
case
the
so-called
common
variety?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
contrary
to
what
the
solicitor
general
explained--
