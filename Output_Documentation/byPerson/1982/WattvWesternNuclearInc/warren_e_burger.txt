we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
watt
against
western
nuclear,
incorporated.
mr.
garvey,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
that
time
had
the
modified
definition
been
reached
by
the
interior
department?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
'29.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
before
1916
or
whenever
this
first
decision
was
made,
or
before
the
'29,
whatever
is
the
ore
from
which
nuclear
material
is
extracted
would
not
have
been
regarded
as
a
valuable
mineral
in
that
time,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
we
have
a
case
within
recent
years
where
it
turned
to
some
extent
on
the
adjective
"valuable"
mineral,
which--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--considers
that--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
granite
that
you
just
mentioned,
what
is
the
status
of
granite?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
is
the
consequence
of
that?
would
they
be
classified
as
minerals
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
he
can
ignore
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
a
mineral
reservation,
or
was
the
mineral
reservation,
the
same
in
these
grants
to
the
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
and
the
other
railroads
to
every
other
section?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
vaguely
recall
in
some
other
case
a
great
concern
in
congress
at
the
time
they
were
making
these
grants,
that
there
was
some
objection
on
the
grounds
that
this
was
a
give-away
of
very
valuable
public
property.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the
railroads
could
use
it
for
running
a
railroad
and
the
farmers
and
ranchers
were
given
this
grant
free
in
order
to
use
it
for
farming
or
ranching
purposes
but
not
other
purposes.
is
that
an
oversimplification?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
terms
of
the
patent,
the
patent
didn't
issue
until
they
had
worked
the
land
for
some
period
of
time
of
several
years,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
how
many
acres
have
been
patented
under
this
act
that
we're
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shaver.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
the
question
a
little
broader
than
that?
did
they
intend
to
reserve
everything
except
what
was
essential
for
the
purposes
of
the
grant;
that
is,
grazing
and
farming,
raising
crops?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
the
situation
at
that
time
with
respect
to
all
of
the
components
that
make
up
the
ore
from
which
uranium
is
now
extracted?
would
there
have
been
any
way
for
the
people
in
the
department
of
the
interior
to
anticipate
that
that
might
be
of
future
enormous
commercial
value?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
the
uses
never
undergo
any
changes
in
terms
of
reflecting
the
greater
economic
value?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oil
shale,
for
example,
wasn't
worth
anyone's
attention
at
one
point
in
history.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
remand
that
you
referred
to
at
least
tangentially
here
would
be
to
determine
whether...
to
determine
something
which
had
not
been
argued
or
presented;
namely,
is
there
a
difference
by
virtue
of
the
commercial
value?
is
that
the
basis
of
a
remand
that
you
were
referring
to?
did
you
request
a
remand?
no,
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
hypothetical
that
was
suggested
was
that
that
has
not
been
decided
by
any
court.
it
is
now
raised
in
this
on
appeal
for
the
first
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course,
up
in
minnesota
we
refer
to
those
great
iron
ore
areas
as
open
pit
mining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
not
very
much
different
from...
how
does
that
help
you
very
much?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
fact
is
it's
an
open
pit--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--gravel
mine
as
well,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
garvey,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
did
you
say
that
was?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
