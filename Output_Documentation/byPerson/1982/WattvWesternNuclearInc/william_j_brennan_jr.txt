justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--mr.
shaver,
may
i
ask,
in
your
brief
you
have
argued
that
the
question
presented
by
the
government
is
really
not
here,
was
not
raised
below.
have
you
abandoned
that
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
you
have
been
arguing
the
merits.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
we
agreed
with
you,
what
should
we
do
with
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
so,
mr.
shaver,
what
you're
asking
us,
i
gather,
is
you
say
let
the
tenth
circuit
decision
stand,
is
that
we
dismiss
this
petition
as
improvidently
granted.
is
that
it?
