mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
we
are
attempting
to
ascertain
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
1916
congress
specifically
reserved
gravel
in
its
mineral
reservation
of
all
coal
and
other
minerals.
i
think
the
case
law
and
the
legislative
history
is
particularly
important
to
look
at,
the
condition
of
the
country
at
the
time
and
what
congress
was
intending
to
do
when
it
passed
the
1916
stock-raising
homestead
act.
you
will
recall
that
between
1900
and
1910
president
roosevelt
withdrew
approximately
150
million
acres
of
public
lands
from
entry,
both
agricultural
and
mineral.
subsequent
to
that
time,
in
1907,
president
roosevelt
urged
congress
to
pass
legislation
which
would
provide
for
a
distinct
title
to
the
surface
and
reserve
to
the
government
underlying
fuel
and
minerals.
congress
commenced
passage
of
legislation
in
1909.
the
1916
stock-raising
homestead
act
was
the
last
of
the
large
land
grants
to
settle
the
west,
provided,
as
has
been
stated,
for
640
acres
rather
than
the
normal
160
or
320,
because
that
type
of
land,
that
barren
semiarid
west,
required
an
acreage
of
that
nature
to
support
the
plucky
homesteader
who
could
go
out
there
and
try
to
make
a
living.
did
congress
in
1916
intend
to
reserve
gravel
under
that
mineral
reservation?
congress--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--i
think
when
one
looks
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
one
sees
it
replete
with
the
phrases:
what
we
are
attempting
here
is
to
settle
up
to
one-fourth
of
the
remaining
public
domain.
what
the
west
needs
is
settlers,
people,
homes,
communities,
churches,
railroads.
the
stock-raising
homestead
act
was
a
means
to
that
end.
it
was
a
means
to
settle
the
west.
i
don't
believe
the
stock-raising
homestead
act
was
just
a
means
to
graze
stock.
the
cattle
barons
had
been
grazing
stock
on
the
western
lands,
the
public
domain,
long
before
1916.
and
in
fact,
the
lands
were
overgrazed
at
that
time.
this
was
a
means
to
get
people
out
there,
to
tie
them
to
communities,
to
build
towns,
to
add
to
the
tax
rolls.
this
was
shortly
after
these
western
rocky
mountain
states
joined
the
union,
became
states.
they
needed
people
to
add
to
the
tax
rolls.
the
only
way
to
get
that
was
to
get
them
out
there
to
build
cities,
to
make
improvements.
i
think
that
was
the
underlying
purpose,
the
driving
force
behind
the
passage
of
the
stock-raising
homestead
act.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
the
act
was
drafted
or--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--it
was
proposed
by
first
assistant
secretary
jones
from
the
land
department.
i
mean,
he
was
the
person
from
the
land
department
who
was
responsible
for
the
drafting.
he
is
a
person
who
had
written
the
decision
in
hughes
v.
florida
in
1913,
quoting
from
the
language
in
zimmerman
v.
brunson.
and
he
submitted
the
first
draft
about
5
or
6
months
to
the
congressional
committee
who
later
reported
it
out
in
essentially
the
same
form.
congressman
taylor
of
colorado
was
also
regarded
as
a
sponsor
of
the
act
and
was
later
the
author
of
the
taylor
grazing
act,
in
further
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
well,
i
would
think
so.
i
would
point
also
to
the
fact
that
the
case
the
government
cited
recently
of
northern
pacific
railroad
v.
soderburg,
a
1903
case,
there
was
one
mr.
ballinger
who
argued
before
this
court
on
reargument
for
the
successful
appellee.
that
was
the
same
mr.
ballinger
who
was
secretary
ballinger
who
wrote
the
decision
in
zimmerman
v.
brunson.
secretary
ballinger
was
a
noted
expert
on
mineral
law
at
the
time.
i
don't
think
that
case
can
be
regarded
as
an
aberration.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
under
the
1916
act?
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
i
don't
believe
at
that
time
that
there
was
regulatory
authority
such
as
we
know
it
today.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
justice
white,
absolutely
by
land
department
decisions,
yes.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
it
has
long
been
regarded
that
the
department
or
agency
interpreting
the
law
that
it
administers
is
given
the
weight
of
quasi-judicial
authority,
and
the
interpretation
by
that
agency
would
be
the
interpretation--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--i
don't
know
as
if
i
could
extend
it
to
that
extreme.
i
would
say,
yes,
that
congress
would
be
presumed
to
know
what
those
decisions
were
and
that
that
was
the
status
of
the--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--well,
obviously,
there
was.
so,
yes,
there
could
be.
there
could
be.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
justice
white,
i
don't
think
it
could
have
been
contemplated
by
congress,
no.
obviously,
judicial
tribunals
sometimes
reverse
themselves.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
the
situation
in
the
case
that
overruled
zimmerman
v.
brunson,
layman
v.
ellis,
was
a
case
that
arose
in
1929.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
it
was
a
case
that
arose
in
california,
in
southern
california,
during
the
population
explosion
of
southern
california
at
that
time.
it
was
decided
in
or
about
los
angeles.
the
record
in
that
case,
the
description
in
that
case
by
the
writer
is
filled
with
facts
and
figures
about
the
production
of
gravel
and
about
how
much
more
valuable
it
has
become
in
1929
than
it
was
in
the
prior
decade.
so
that
administrative
tribunal
i
think
was
persuaded
by
some
excellent
advocacy
on
perhaps...
on
behalf
of
the
mineral
claimant
when
the
mineral
claimant
kept
stressing
that
it
had
now
become
valuable,
it
had
now
become
valuable,
and
therefore
decided
it
was
a
mineral
sua
sponte
and
forgot
to
worry
about
deciding
whether
it
was
a
mineral
ab
initio
but
just
decided
it
was
because
it
was
valuable.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
well,
it
can
be
taken
in
two
contexts.
i
don't
know
as
a
matter
of
law
it
can
be
said
that
it
was
wrong.
i
think
it
was
a
mistake.
i
think
that
at
that
time
that--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--i
think
that
the
land
department
was...
did
have
authority
to
overrule
its
own
case.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
yes.
i
believe
it
did.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
i
think
that
in
1916
as
well
as
in
1872,
if
you
will
allow
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
give
a
little
bit
longer
answer
to
a
short
question,
that
one
cannot
say
the
mineral
reservation
contemplated
only
those
things
known
to
be
mineral
at
the
time
of
the
reservation.
therefore,
if
uranium
oxide
or
u308,
from
bauxite
or
whatever
source...
and
it's
found
also
in
granite
outcroppings...
was
not
known
to
be
valuable
in
concentrated
forms
at
the
time,
i
think
it
could
subsequently
be
a
reserved
mineral.
but
the
difference
is,
as
one
court
has
pointed
out,
and
several
tribunals,
that
gravel
and
its
uses
have
been
known
since
time
immemorial.
it
was
known
in
1872,
it
was
known
at
the
time
of
the
zimmerman
decision,
it
was
known
at
the
time
of
hughes
v.
florida,
it
was
known
at
the
time
in
1916,
and
it
is
known
today.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
i
am
certain
that
the
uses
do
undergo
some
changes,
but
the
consistent
use
for
gravel
throughout
this
period
has
been
for
road,
road
building
and
concrete
aggregate.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
oil
shale
at
one
time
attracted
attention
prior
to
1920
because
claims
were
entered
on
the
oil
shale
lands.
and
there
was
a
department
decision
that
upheld
those.
and
later
this
court
upheld
them.
but
they
were
thought
to
be
of
value
in
the
future,
and
the
department
recognized
that
and
did
not
apply
in
the
oil
shale
cases
the
present
marketability
test.
but
that
was
not
the
same
as
deciding
whether
or
not
it
was
a
mineral
in
the
first
instance.
oil
was
a
mineral,
gas
was
a
mineral.
these
were
the
essence
of
hydrocarbons,
and
so
they
were
regarded
as
minerals.
it
was
getting
the
same
product
although
and
albeit
from
a
different
means.
it
is
not
the
same
at
all
as
talking
about
gravel.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
absolutely
not,
justice
o'connor.
what
the
mining
law
provided
and
what
was
in
the
departmental
decisions
is
the
common
varieties
of
special
distinct
characteristics
could
be
located
under
the
mining
laws.
we
can
see
an
example
today.
clay
has
never
been
locatable
under
the
mining
laws.
however,
bentonite
may
be.
sand
and
gravel
has
never
been
locatable
under
the
mining
laws
until
layman,
and
sand
has
probably
not
been
locatable
unless
it
possesses
special
and
distinct
characteristics
such
as
for
the
making
of
lead
crystal.
that
has
always
throughout
the
mining
law
been
the
differentiation.
ordinary
gravel
was
never
locatable
until
the
layman
decision.
so,
no,
i
do
not
agree
that
just
because
it's
commercially
exploitable
equates
to
special
and
distinct
characteristics.
in
fact,
the
secretary
has
gone
to
great
lengths
to
point
to
the
contrary.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
well,
that
was
a
contest
between
the
entry
man
for
agriculture
and
a
mineral
claimant.
and
i--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--i
imagine
that
they
could
have.
they
had
a
contract
between
themselves,
in
reading
the
case.
the
mineral
claimant
and
the
agricultural
claimant,
before
the
thing
was
taken
for
an
administrative
decision,
had
a
contract.
i
am
not
privy
to
all
of
the
terms
of
the
contract,
but
it
did
provide
that
one
would
stay
away
from
the
other's
domain
pending
the
case.
i
don't
know
the
rest
of
it.
the
case
does
make
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
secretary
in
following
zimmerman
in
the
initial
administrative
decision...
or
rather
the
commissioner
of
public
lands
in
following
zimmerman
in
the
layman
case
was
concerned
that
this
land
was
being
acquired,
that
the
mineral
claimant
was
just
trying
to
jump
the
claim
of
the
agricultural
entry
man.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
i...
justice
white,
it
may--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--i
think
it's
a
matter
of
settled
policy
that
common
varieties
or
common
surface
constituents
which
make
up
much
of
the
earth
are
only
locatable
if
they
possess
special
and
distinct
characteristics.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
there
are
no
cases
and
no
claims
that
i
am
aware
of
in
my
research
where
a
successful
claimant
for
gravel
has
been
able
to
persuade
the
department
on
the
basis
that
gravel
possessed
that.
now,
caliche,
maybe
yes.
in
other
words--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--zimmerman
said
that
there
was
not
a
standard
american
authority
which
recognized
gravel
as
a
mineral,
that
in
the
absence--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--i
think
absolutely.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
justice
o'connor,
i
am
not
aware
of
the
first
patent
issued,
but
i
would
assume
that
it
would
have
been
shortly
after
the
layman
v.
ellis
case
if
that
were
a
commercially
viable
gravel
deposit
because
that
was
the
first
case
where
gravel
had
been
held
to
be
locatable
in
a
contest.
up
until
then
it
was
not.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
no,
i
don't
believe
i
would
characterize
it
as
such,
justice
o'connor.
i
would
say
that
what
happened
is
that
in
layman
v.
ellis
the
patent
had
to
issue
for
the
40
acres
involved
or
such
part
of
it
as
was
mineral
in
character.
following
that
period
of
time,
the--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--under
the
mining
law,
under
the
mining
law
of
1872.
but
what
transpired,
as
this
court
is
well
aware
from
its
decision
in
coleman,
is
that
as
time
went
on,
individuals
attempted,
pursuant
to
the
mining
laws,
to
make
locations
of
sand
and
gravel
deposits
and
therefore
to
receive
a
patent
to
them--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--although
there
was
no
reason
to
receive
a
patent
except
for
to
build
a
fishing
ranch
or
a
home
or
have
a
place
in
the
mountains
or
to
acquire
acreage
that
could
not
otherwise
be
acquired.
and
it
was
these
abuses
in
the
law
that
congress
was
concerned
with
in--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--in
1955.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
when
it
went
to
the...
to
the
common
varieties
or
the
surface
resources
act.
and
i
think
a
brief
history
of
that
is
interesting
to--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--analyze.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
that's--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--i
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
reasons,
but
if
we
will
take
and
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
common
varieties,
gravel
was
not
specifically
considered
nor
were
other
common
surface
constituents
specifically
considered
until...
by
congress
until
1943.
in
1943
senator
hatch
brought
a
bill
before
congress
under
the
emergency
wartime
declaration
act,
providing
for
the
disposal
from
public
lands
of
sand,
gravel,
mesquite,
clay,
et
cetera.
those
particular
substances
were
referred
to
by
senator
hatch
in
the
proposed
bill
as
substances
or
materials.
senator
harold
ickes
at
the
same
time
wrote
a
letter
to
congress
setting
forth
that
he
was
in
accord
with
this
legislastion
and
also
referred
to
these
substances
as
materials.
congress
passed
that
act
in
1944,
and
it
provided
for
the
disposal
of
surface
materials.
one
of
those
materials
was
gravel.
one
was
sand.
one
was
also
clay.
and
i
might
point
out
that
clay
has
never
become
locatable.
in
1947,
because
the
'44
act
had
expired
by
its
terms
because
world
war
ii
was
over,
it
was
thought
necessary
for
congress
to
pass
some
additional
legislation
to
reimplement
these
provisions.
the
1947
act,
as
initially
passed,
was
what
was
referred
to
as
the
materials
act
of
1947.
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
was
cited
in
the
trespass
notice
to
respondent.
the
1947
act,
as
initially
passed,
referred
to
surface
materials,
clay...
excuse
me...
sand,
gravel,
stone,
manzenite,
et
cetera.
it
was
not
until
1955,
when
the
surface
resources,
or
common
varieties,
act
was
passed,
which
you
made
reference
to,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
1947
act
was
amended,
the
materials
act,
so
that
it
would
complement
the
'55
act.
at
that
time,
congress
adopted
an
approved
classification
system,
on
the
one
hand
for
mineral
materials,
on
the
other
hand
for
vegetative
materials.
you
line
up
the
vegetative
materials
over
here
and
the
mineral
materials
over
here.
it's
the
first
time
that
the
word
"mineral"
materials
qualified
the
term
"materials"
as
opposed
to
vegetative.
so
now
the
government
in
1975
has
come
full
circle.
they
started
out
with
substances
and
materials.
in
'47
they
were
materials.
in
'55
they
were
mineral
materials.
and
now
in
'75
all
of
a
sudden
we
have
gravel
as
a
mineral.
and
that's
the
legislative
history.
and
the
only
way
it
became
a
mineral
is
by
administrative
imagination.
it
was
always
before
that
a
material.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
well,
i
would
have
to
call
it--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--i
would
call
all
gravel
common
variety,
as
congress
has,
as
has
been
regarded
in
the
history
of
the
mining
laws.
ordinary
gravel
is
ordinary
gravel.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
no,
justice
brennan.
i...
i
believe--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--yes.
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief
that
i
believe
that
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
government
reserved
gravel
susceptible
to
commercial
exploitation
has
been
an
anomaly
to
this
case.
it
hasn't
been
passed
upon
by
the
tribunals
below.
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
case
at
any
step
of
the
way.
one
was
requested
before
the
ibla,
and
it
was
disallowed.
this
whole
case
has
gotten
to
this
court
as
essentially
an
argument
on
the
law.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
i
would
suggest
that
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
stand.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
it
was
not
raised
by
the
respondent,
and
i
don't
believe
it
need
be
addressed.
but
i
thought
that
it
was
obligatory
upon
counsel
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
particular
issue,
as
phrased
by
the
government
in
the
issue
presented
to
this
court,
was
not
raised
nor
passed
upon
by
the
tribunals
below
and--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--yes,
your
honor,
that
would...
justice
brennan,
that
is
exactly
what
i
suggested
in
that
particular
phase
of
the
brief.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
since
layman
they
have
considered
that
gravel
could
be,
yes.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
i
think
largely--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--no,
nor
would
i
contend
that
it
never
could
be,
justice
white,
if
it
possessed
special
and
distinct
characteristics.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
yes.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
well,
the
legislation
by
inference,
i
believe,
would
have
to
indicate
that.
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
the
'44
act
nor
the
'47
act
if
congress
had
believed
gravel
to
be
locatable.
there
would
have
been
no
need--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--the
legislative
history
in
those
acts
suggests
that
there
was
no
means
for
disposal
available
at
all
for
gravel,
and
therefore
this
legislation
was
necessary.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
i...
they
chose
not
to
regard
it
because
of
the
fact
that
the
only...
all
of
the
history
of
mining
law
and
what
knowledgable
people
in
the
mining
law
business
would
consider
to
be
a
mineral
excluded
gravel.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
what
had
happened
is
that
rather
than
considering
whether
or
not
it
was
a
mineral
ab
initio
is
that
the
department
got
carried
away...
and
i
think
that
the
courts
adopted
this
test
in
some
instances
in
subsequent
cases...
deciding
first
whether
a
substance
was
valuable.
once
they
found
it
to
be
valuable,
then
they
assumed
that
it
was
mineral.
and
i
think
that
the
cart's
before
the
horse
a
little
bit.
and
i
think
that's
the
perspective
that
layman
must
be
viewed
in.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
justice
stevens,
do
you
make
reference
to
one
case
overruling
another?
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
it
was,
but
what
occurred
as
time
went
on
that
the
department
kept
applying
a
tighter
and
tighter
test
because
of
so
many
applications
for
mineral
entry
on
sand
and
gravel
claims,
which
was
the
unintended
abuse
that
congress
had
to
step
in
and
correct
in
1955.
so,
yes,
a
lot
of
claims
came
up,
but
most
of
them,
although
i
have
not
made
a
count,
it's
my
opinion
that
most
of
them
have
been
disallowed
over
a
period
of
time
and--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--they
were
found
not
to
be
mineral
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
they
were
valuable,
not--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--vice
versa.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
the
issue
here
i
don't
believe
is
one
of
discussing
the
location
or
location
requirements
pre
or
since
coleman,
but
deciding
what
the
intent
of
the
1916
congress
was.
and
it
seems
impossible
to
consider
that
in
preserving
the
mineral
estate
to
the
government,
that
the
1916
congress
or
anyone
could
have
ever
thought
that
miners
would
go
out
west
to
mine
a
valuable
gravel
deposit.
and
mind
you
that
gravel
is
normally
referred
to
as
gravel
pits,
not
gravel
mines.
the
whole
history
of
it
would
denote
that
it's
not
considered
a
mineral.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
open-pit
mines,
because
the
ore
is
extracted
by
open-pit
method.
but
gravel
pits
in
fact--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--just
the
common
ordinary--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--association--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
was
just
trying
to
make
reference
to
the
common
ordinary
association
of
the
term
in
every-day
use.
one
digs
gravel,
one
has
gravel
pits.
one
has
open-pit
mines
but
one
doesn't
normally
refer
to
open-pit
gravel
mines,
just
refer
to
gravel
pits.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
case
in
this
instance
where
this
gravel
was
dug,
as
the
government
pointed
out,
from
a
ranch
which
western
nuclear
acquired,
this
wasn't
just
a
piece
of
ground
acquired
to
obtain
the
gravel,
it
was
a
ranch
that
western
nuclear
acquired.
and
the
government
has
made
the
assertion
in
its
brief
that
the
ranch
was
acquired
specifically
to
obtain
the
gravel.
this
is
less
than
the
$13,000
case.
the
respondent
did
not
acquire
a
several-thousand-acre
ranch
for
the
devious
purpose
of
just
acquiring
a
gravel
deposit.
it
just
doesn't
stand
to
reason.
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
i
attach
no
significance
to--
mr.
harley
w.
shaver,
iii
--to
what...
to
that.
i
think
the
controlling
date
is
1916
and
the
intent
of
congress
at
the
time
the
reservation
was
in
the
legislation.
