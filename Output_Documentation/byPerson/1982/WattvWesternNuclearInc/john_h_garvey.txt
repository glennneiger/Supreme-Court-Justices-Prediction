mr.
john
h.
garvey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
gravel
deposits
which
are
susceptible
to
commercial
exploitation
are
reserved
to
the
united
states
under
the
mineral
reservation
and
the
stock-raising
homestead
act.
respondent,
western
nuclear,
owns
a
uranium
mine
about
12
miles
south
of
jeffrey
city,
wyoming,
a
company
town
where
its
workers
live.
it
also
mills
the
uranium
a
mile
or
two
northeast
of
the
town.
from
the
time
in
the
early
1950s
when
western
nuclear
first
located
in
this
area,
it
acquired
gravel
for
its
various
needs
in
lander,
wyoming,
about
65
miles
away,
and
in
casper,
wyoming,
about
85
miles
away.
in
1975,
finding
that
method
of
acquisition
a
little
expensive,
it
acquired
part
of
some
land
about
a
mile
north
of
jeffrey
city
where
there
was
a
deposit
of
gravel.
respondent
thereafter
mined
about
43,000
cubic
yards
of
gravel
from
that
deposit,
or
about
60,000
tons,
which
it
used
for
making
cement
to
line
the
sides
of
its
mineshafts,
for
concrete
aggregate
for
lining
the
streets
and
the
sidewalks
in
jeffrey
city
and
for
building
roads
on
which
to
haul
its
ore.
the
land
on
which
the
gravel
deposit
was
located
had
been
patented
in
1926,
under
the
stock-raising
homestead
act.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
it
was
in
1929
that
the--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--department
of
the
interior
decided
layman
against
ellis.
the
homestead
claim
which
was
at
stake
in
layman
against
ellis
had
been
first
located
in
1925.
when
the
bureau
of
land
management
learned
of
the
appropriation
of
the
gravel
deposit,
it
informed
respondent
that
its
appropriation
of
the
gravel
was
a
trespass
against
the
mineral
interests
of
the
united
states
reserved
under
the
stock-raising
homestead
act
and,
after
undertaking
an
appraisal
of
the
property,
concluded
that
respondent
was
liable
in
the
amount
of
$13,000
for
royalties
for
the
gravel
taken.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
to
my
knowledge,
it
was
the
first
such
action,
although
i
should
say
that
the
history
of
the
government's
enforcement
of
this...
of
these
rights
is
a
little
like
what
mark
twain
said
about
wagner's
music,
it's
actually
better
than
it
sounds.
until
1955
these
kinds
of
gravel
deposits
were
not
sold
but
were
locatable
under
the
mining
act
of
1872
and
they--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--1955.
and
so
anybody
who
wanted
to
acquire
these
deposits
could
just
go
on
the
land
and
take
them
with...
after
making
accommodations
with
the
homesteader.
after
1955,
in
fact,
in
1957,
promptly
after
the
common
varieties
act,
which
permitted
sale
of
these
deposits
was
passed,
the
solicitor
of
interior
in
a
solicitor's
opinion
addressed
to
the
director
in
denver
said
that
passage
of
this
act
shouldn't
be
understood
to
have
relinquished
the
government's
interest
in
gravel
deposits
on
stock-raising
homestead
act
lands.
all
that
the
common
varieties
act
did
was
to
change
the
method
of
disposal
from
location
to
sale.
and
although
it's
difficult
to
say
to
what
extent
the
people
seeking
gravel
deposits
on
stock-raising
homestead
act
lands
actually
get
permission
of
the
department
because
of
the
way
the
records
are
kept
in
the
resource
area...
there
isn't
any...
there
isn't
any
separate
line
on
the
form
that
they
fill
out
to
say
what
kind
of
lands
gravel
deposits
are
taken
from...
i
notice
that
in
the
trujillo
case,
on
which
respondent
in
the
court
of
appeals
relied,
that
the
state
of
new
mexico
in
1971
had
acquired
a
permit
from
the
bureau
of
land
management
to
acquire
gravel
deposits
on
stock-raising
homestead
act
lands.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that's
entirely
possible.
and
it's
also
the
case
that
the
enforcement
resources
of
the
bureau
of
land
management
are
not
such
that
they
are
able
to
police
the
use
that's
made
of
these
deposits.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
so
far
as
i
know,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
in
the
district
court--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--in
the
district
court...
it's
not
that
we
are
now
limiting
our
claim.
in
fact,
that
has
been
the
issue
right
along.
in
the
district--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
but
the
stock-raising
homesteader
makes
use
of
it?
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that
was...
that
issue
was
left
open
in
the
district
court,
and
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
concede
on
behalf
of
the
department
that
those
deposits
don't--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--belong,
although
if...
it
may
be
that
the
government
could
permit
free
use
to
the
stock-raising
homestead
act--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--indeed.
if
the
deposit--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
unless
it's...
unless
it
is
a
valuable
mineral.
under
the
mining
law--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--that
is
correct,
although
you
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
under
the
mining
law...
what
the
mining
act
of
1872,
for
example,
is
talking
about
deposits
on...
on
lands
which
the
government
owns
in
fee,
so
that
it's
possible
to
speak
of
minerals
without
taking
any
account
of
how
much
of
the
mineral
is
on
the
land.
on
the
other
hand,
where
the
government
has
severed
the
surface
estate
from
the
mineral
estate,
it's
difficult
to
speak
of...
to
say
that
the
government
has
retained
an
interest
in
all
minerals
in
the
land
simply
because
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
for
anybody
on
the
surface
to
make
any
use
of
the
surface
without
somehow
interfering
with
some
of
the
minerals
that--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--certainly.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
we
don't
maintain
that
the
definition
of
a
mineral
turns
on
whether
it's
commercially
usable.
we
rather
say
that
the
minerals
in
which
the
government
is
interested
under
the
stock-raising
homestead
acts
are
minerals
which
it
is
able
to
dispose
of
separately
and
which
have
some
use
apart
from
the
land
on
which
they're
found.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
has
to
reach--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--okay.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
it's...
it's
a
little
bit
more
complex.
as
the
passage
of
the
materials
act
in
1947
made
clear,
there
were
some
kinds
of
gravel
that
were
locatable
under
the
mining
act
and
some
kinds
of
gravel
that
were
not.
essentially,
the
distinction
between
the
two
types
was
that
the
kinds
of
gravel
which
were
useful
for
making
concrete
for
paving,
for
making
cinder
block,
were
reserved.
the
kinds
of
gravel
which
were
useful
for
purposes
of
fill
or
riprap...
that
is
to
say,
large
chunks
six
or
eight
inches
in
diameter...
were
not
disposable
under
the
mining
act.
those
kinds
were
not
considered
minerals.
the
reason
i
said
the
court
needn't
reach
that
question
in
this
case
is
that
the
kinds
of
gravel
which
respondent
was
using
are
the
kinds
of
gravel
that
were
disposable
under
the
mining
act.
those
other
kinds
which
are
useful
for
purposes
of
fill
or
for
riprap
are
a
question
which
the
court
needn't
reach
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
one
was
locatable
as
a
mineral
under
the
mining
act
of
1872.
the
presence
of
that
kind
of
gravel
on
the
land
in
deposits
sufficiently
valuable
to
justify
a
location
would
permit
somebody
to
go
on
the
land
with
respect
to
location.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
would
say
that
the
stock-raising
homestead
act
leaves
open
the
possibility
that
that
sort
of
gravel
can
be
considered--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--yes.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
the
acts--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--the
act
says
in
the
second
sentence
that
the
disposal
of
the
mineral
deposits
on
the
land
shall
be
subject
to
disposal
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
mineral
land
laws
in
force
at
the
time
of
such
disposal,
which
means
that
even
though
it
may
not
have
been
disposable
in
1916
it
could
well
have
become
disposable
and
hence
included
within
the
mineral
reservation
with
the
passage
of
the
materials
act.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
if
he
were
in
doubt,
he
could
certainly
ask
the
bureau
of
land
management.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
it's
entirely
possible,
although
i
should
point
out
that
in
that
respect
gravel
is
not
different
from
other
kinds
of
minerals
under
the
mining
act
or
under
the...
under
the
mining
laws
in
general.
in
1915,
a
year
before
this
act
was
passed,
the
department
of
the
interior
held
that
bauxite
was
not
a
locatable
mineral
even
though
it
was
known
that
bauxite
contained
uranium,
simply
because
at
that
time
there
wasn't
the
technological
process
for
extracting
uranium
from
bauxite.
i
doubt
whether
that
would
be
followed
today.
or,
to
take
another
example,
in
1949
congress
said
that
people
were
going
on
stock-raising
homestead
act
lands
in
order
to
mine
bentonite,
which
is
used
for
drilling
mud
or
for
a
process
for
collecting
iron
ore
called
taconite
pelletizing.
and
although
bentonite
wasn't
used
for
those
purposes
in
1916,
congress
recognized
in
1949
that
those
had
become
minerals
which
would
justify
entry
on
stock
raising
homestead
acts
from...
act
lands
for
mining
purposes.
or
uranium,
for
that
matter.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
am...
i
was
unable
to
find
cases
holding
to
that
effect,
undoubtedly
because
nobody
had
any
use
for
the
material.
it
may
well
have
been
considered
a
mineral.
i
doubt
that
it
would
have
been
considered
a
valuable
mineral
at
that
time.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
correct.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
in
andrus
against
shell
oil
this
court
decided
that
the
interpretation
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920
since
the
time
of
its
passage
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
by
congress
suggested
that
oil
shale
was
a
valuable
mineral
before
1920
and
so
locatable
under
the
mining
act.
what
we
are
maintaining
in
this
case
is
much
the
same,
that
the
consistent
interpretation
both
by
the
secretary
and
by
congress
since
passage
of
the
stock-raising
homestead
act
in
that
case.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i...
i
qualified
my
statement
by
saying
that
the
consistent
interpretation
since
the
passage
of
the
act.
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
zimmerman
against
brunson
the
secretary
held
that
gravel
deposits,
much
like
the
gravel
deposits
in
this
case,
would
not
disqualify
land
from
being
homesteaded
because
they
should
not
be
considered
to
make
the
land
valuable
for
minerals.
i
would
suggest
that
when
congress
passed
the
act
in
1916,
it
may
well
have
thought
differently
had
it
addressed
the
question
about
whether
gravel
was--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--that's
correct.
zimmerman
was
on
the
books
for
6
years
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed.
but
i
might
say
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
cases
like
northern
pacific
against
soderburg
had
held
that
granite
was
a
mineral
reserved
from
the
lands
given
to
the
northern
pacific
railway,
that
the
u.s.
geological
survey
in
1913,
3
years
after
zimmerman,
had
said
that
the
presence
of
gravel
deposits
on
land
could
make
them
lands
valuable
for
minerals
and
so
disposable
under
the
mining
laws.
even
the
other
decisions
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
at
the
time
zimmerman
was
decided
suggested
that
materials
like
pumice
and
granite,
which
like
gravel
are
now
held
as
disposable
under
the
common
varieties
act,
would
make
the
land
valuable
for
minerals.
but
quite
apart
from
all
of
that,
the
question
in
zimmerman
against
brunson
was
whether
the
land
should
be
used
for
homesteading
purposes
or
for
mining
purposes.
at
that
time
if
you
got
a
homestead
or
a
mining
location,
you
got
everything,
the
surface
and
the
minerals.
and
so
by
contrast,
under
the
stock-raising
homestead
act
the
presence
of
gravel
will
not
disqualify
the
land
from
being
homesteaded.
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--i
don't
want
to
press
the
point
too
strongly.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
think
that
congress
certainly
meant
to
include
in
the
stock-raising
homestead
act
those
minerals
that
were
locatable
under
the
mining
law.
i
also
think
in
the
second
sentence
of
the
act
that
congress
intended
to
leave
open
the
possibility
that
the
mineral
reservation
would
be
elastic
in
the
sense
that
it
could
expand
or
contract.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
assume
that
it
is
now
locatable,
that
it
is
now
subject
to
disposal
under
the
common
varieties
act,
which
speaks
of
common
varieties
of
stone.
granite
deposits
in
uncommon
varieties
would
now
be
still
locatable
under
the
mining
act.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
the
passage
of
the
common
varieties
act
in
1955
did
not
act
as
a
quit
claim
to
the
government's
interest
in
these
kinds
of
minerals.
what
it
did,
rather,
was
simply
to
change
the
method
of
disposal
of
these
minerals
from
location
under
the
mining
law
to
sale,
because
congress
expressed
a
concern
that
people
who
were
locating
common
varieties
of
minerals
weren't
developing
them
in
the
way
in
which
the
mining
act
intended,
much
as,
if
i
may
draw
an
analogy,
in
passing
the
mineral
leasing
act
in
1920,
what
congress
did
was
to
change
the
method
of
disposal
of
oil
deposits,
for
example,
from
location
under
the
mining
law
to
leasing
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920.
it
didn't
give
up
the
government's
interest
in
those
minerals,
it
simply
provided
a
different
method
for
disposing
of
them.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
am
sorry.
it
may...
my
discussion
with
justice
rehnquist
may
have
confused
that
matter.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
there
are
two
kinds
of
distinctions,
and
i
was
speaking
about
the
other
one.
what
the
government
asserts
an
interest
in
this...
in
in
this
case--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
the
government
does
not
assert
an
interest
in
that.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
yes.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
would
say
so,
yes.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
yes.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no.
what
we
were
speaking
of
when
we
talked
about
free
use
were
commercially
exploitable
deposits
of
gravel
which
in
fact
belong
to
the
united
states
and
not
to
the
rancher.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
not
the
patent
owner.
the
stock-raising
homesteaders
who
use
them
for
purposes
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
act
may
make
free
use
of
them.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that's
correct.
it's
not
a...
it's
not
a
distinction
between
prior
and
subsequent
patent
owners
but
rather
the
use
to
which
the
gravel
is
put.
the
fact
that
the
government
is
willing
to
allow
ranchers
to
make
free
use
of
gravel
doesn't
mean
that
if
a
cement
company
acquires
the
surface
estate
it's
entitled
to
use
the
gravel,
for
instance.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
more
like
a...
kind
of.
it's
a
little
like
a
determinable
fee
or
an
estate
on
condition
subsequent
with
respect
to
these
kinds
of
materials.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no.
it
has
to
be
a
mineral
which
is
the
kind
of
mineral
recognized
by
the
mineral
land
laws
of
the
united
states.
black
dirt
is
not
a
mineral,
no
matter
how
valuable
it
is.
peat
is
not
a
mineral,
no
matter
how
valuable
it
is.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
sand
is
a
more
difficult
question.
there
are
some
kinds
of
sand
which
have
been
held
to
be
minerals
locatable
under
the
mining
act
and
may
well
be--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--yes.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
it's
true
of
any
kind
of
mineral.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
don't
think
the
government
has
an
interest
in
coal
when
it
has
no
commercial
value.
let
me
give
you
another
example.
when
you
grow
hydrangeas,
the
blue
color
in
hydrangeas
is
caused
by
a
compound
of
aluminum.
to
say
that
the
stock-raising
homesteader
couldn't
grow
hydrangeas
because
he's
using
aluminum
in
the
land
would
make
it
impossible
to
implement
the--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--i
would
say
that
the
government
does
not
have
an
ownership
interest
in
the
aluminum
unless
there
is
some...
unless
it
is
there
in
sufficient
quantities
to
make
it
possible
for
the
government
to
dispose
of
it.
the
reason
the
government
is
taking
this
position
is
that
in
passing
the
stock-raising
homestead
act,
what
the
government
intended
to
do
was
to
make
multiple
use
of
these
semiarid
lands
in
the
west.
one
use
that
it
wanted
to
make
of
the
lands
was
to
encourage
stock-raising
homesteads.
what
the...
section
2
of
the
act
says
that
the
secretary
in
classifying
lands
for
entry
under
this
act
shall
set
apart
lands
that
are
chiefly
valuable
for
grazing
and
forage
farming.
section
3
of
the
act
says
that
in
order
to
get
a
patent,
what
the
entry
man
has
to
do
is
to
improve
the
value
of
the
land
for
stock-raising
purposes.
it
says
in
the
reports.
it
suggests
that
he
ought
to
do
things
like
building
fences
or
building
silos
or
digging
wells.
that's
one
use
that
the
government
wanted
to
make
of
the
lands.
and
the
reports
say
that
the
farmer-stockman
is
not
seeking
and
does
not
desire
the
minerals,
his
experience
and
efforts
being
in
the
line
of
stock
raising
and
farming.
that's
one
use
the
government
wanted
to
make.
and
the
other
use
that
the
government
wanted
to
make
was
to
develop
the
mineral
estate.
there
was
a
lot
of
concern
expressed
at
the
time
of
the
passage
that
the...
that
the
lands
being
given
away,
640
acres
or
one
square
mile,
might,
again
in
the
words
of
the
report,
might
withdraw
immense
areas
from
prospecting
and
mineral
development.
and
so
whenever
they
talk
about
the
size
of
the
estate
being
given
away,
they're
careful
to
say
that
all
minerals
are
reserved.
now,
what
the
government
tried
to
do
in
making
multiple
use
of
the
lands
like
that
was
to
define
the
estates
that
it
was
giving
to
the...
to
the
surface
owner
and
to
the
mineral
entry
man
in
terms
of
the
intended
use
to
be
made
of
the
property.
it
doesn't
make
sense
for
the
government
to
claim
that
it
retains
and
can
prevent
any
use
by
the
stock-raising
homesteader
of
minerals
that
appear
on
the
land
in
traces
insufficient
to
justify
disposal
by
any
means.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that's
correct,
although
i
should
say
that
with
respect
to
coal,
as
with
respect
to
gravel
in
this
case,
even
under
the
coal
lands
acts,
like
the
act
of
1909,
1910,
1912,
the
government
recognized
explicitly
in
the
case
of
the
1909
and
1910
acts
and
by
decision
of
the
secretary
in
the
case
of
the
1912
act,
that
people
on
the
land
could
make
use
of
the
coal
for
domestic
purposes.
they
were
simply
not
allowed
to
sell
it,
make
commercial
use
of
it.
so
in
a
lot
of
cases,
that
concern
wouldn't
arise.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
believe
that
the
language
may
have
been
similar.
i
think
they
spoke
then
of
mineral
lands
in
the
third
section
of
the
northern
pacific.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that
was
in
fact
the
reason
for
making
the
mineral
reservation,
and
the
railroads
were
entitled
to
choose
other
lands
when--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--i
think
that's
essentially
correct,
although
the
government
doesn't
maintain
that
the
patentee
has
to
keep
it
as
a
stock-raising
homestead
forever.
patentees
are
entitled
to
make
whatever
use
they
want
of
the
land
once
they
get
the
patent.
and
their
title
to
the
land
doesn't
depend
on
maintaining
it
as
a
ranch.
it's
just
that
the
use
they
may
be
entitled...
that
they
may
be
permitted
by
the
government
to
make
of
the
minerals.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that's
correct;
and
increase
the
value
of
the
land
in
something
like
$1.25
an
acre
for
stock-raising
purposes.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
something
more
than
33
million
acres.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
would
just
like
to
make
three
brief
points.
the
first
is
in
the
court
of
appeals,
respondent's
brief
at
page
2
said,
in
march
of
1975
in
order
to
obtain
a
ready
and
convenient
source
of
gravel
and
for
other
purposes,
western
nuclear
acquired
in
fee
a
substantial
piece
of
ranch
property
which
included
the
subject
land.
the
second
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
there
has
been
some
uncertainty
about
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
materials
act
of
1947
and
its
predecessor,
the
act
of
1944,
for
disposing
of
gravel
which
could
not
otherwise
be
disposed
of.
justice
rehnquist
asked
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument
whether
the
government
claimed
all
gravel
under
its
reservation
in
the
stock-raising
homestead
act.
and
i
hesitated
because
until
1944
gravel
in
deposits,
gravel
useful
for
purposes
of
fill
or
riprap
or
uses
like
that
rather
than
gravel
useful
for
making
concrete
and
hot-mix
aggregate
was
not
locatable
under
the
mining
laws
and
there
was
no
way
of
disposing
of
that
kind
of
gravel
at
the
time.
the
reason
i
hesitated
in
saying
that
the
government
does...
needn't
claim
all
gravel
in
this
case
is
that
the
kind
of
gravel
which
is
at
stake
in
this
case
is
the
kind
of
gravel
that
was
locatable
under
the
mining
laws
and
could
be
disposed
of
before
1944.
justice
o'connor,
you
asked
whether
the
government
was
saying
that
this
kind
of
gravel
was
not
common
variety
gravel.
the
government
does...
the
government
admits
that
it
was
common
variety
gravel
in
the
sense
in
which
the
1955
act
uses
the
word
"common
variety".
that
is
not
to
say
that
it
was
not
locatable
under
the
mining
act
of
1872.
the
third
point
i
would
like
to
make
relates
to
justice
brennan's
concern
about
this
question
not
having
been
raised
before.
in
the
district
court
the
government
stated...
this
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
respondent's
brief
in
opposition...
what
the
united
states
is
concerned
about
are
commercial
gravel
operations.
the
united
states
does
not
see
how
a
commercial
gravel
operation
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
lends
itself
to--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--this
is
in
page
5a.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
it
was
made
in
connection
with
a
post-judgment
motion
by
the
wyoming
stock
growers
association
for
motion
for
a
new
trial
or
a
motion
to
alter
or
amend
the
judgment.
the
wyoming
stock
growers
association
was
concerned
that
the
district
judge's
opinion
did
not
address
their
claim
to
use
of
the
gravel.
the
government
said,
we
are
not
deciding
that
question
in
this
case.
we
don't
contend
that
they're
not
allowed
to
use
it.
and
the
government
and
the
stock
growers
thereafter
stipulated
that
the
decision
by
the
district
court
would
have
no
res
judicata
effect
on
claims
by
ranchers
to
use--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--no,
there
was
not
a
stipulation,
although
there
was
never
an
issue
about
that.
the
bureau
of
land
management
took
the
position
that
it
was
only
salable
gravel
deposits
that
they
were
concerned
with.
they
appraised
the
land
and
decided
that
the
fair
market
value
in
that
market
for
the
gravel
was
30
cents
a
cubic
yard.
the
interior
board
of
land
appeals,
page
65a...
65a
of
the
government's
appendix...
interior
board
of
land
appeals
said
that
it
is
thus
clear
that
gravel
in
a
valuable
deposit
is
a
mineral
reserve
to
the
united
states
in
patents
issued
under
the
stock-raising
homestead
act,
and
went
on
to
say
that
the
respondent
had
introduced
no
evidence
which
led
it
to
question
the
appraisal
which
had
been
made
by
the
bureau
of
land
management,
and
for
that
reason,
because
there
was
no
factual
evidence
to
contradict
the
appraisal,
would
not...
would
not
give
them
a
hearing.
just
one
last
point.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government's
brief,
as
the
first
issue
presented,
said
the
issue
is
whether
the
district
court
correctly
concluded
that
the
stock-raising
homestead
act
in
its
legislative
history
show
that
congress
intended
to
reserve
all
gravel
deposits
susceptible
to
commercial
exploitation
on
lands
patented
under
the
act.
