you
would
agree
with
that
approach?
justice

o'connor
the
problem
in
part
is
the
possible
uncertainty
about
what
virginia
law
is.
for
example,
we
have
a
brief
filed
here
coming
out
of
the
virginia
law
school
that
says
that
it
is
clear
that
virginia
law
is
contrary
to
your
position--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--which
has
no
written
opinion.
you
cited
it
in
your
brief,
but
your
opponent
did
not
refer
to
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
effect
does
virginia
give
to
those
unreported
decisions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
any
event
you
are
content
to
let
it
rest
on
whatever
virginia
law
would
determine,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
proceeded
to
decide
what
virginia
law
was,
and
normally
i
suppose
this
court
defers
to
that
kind
of
a
determination,
does
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
referring
to
the
souders
case?
