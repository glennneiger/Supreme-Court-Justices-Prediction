well,
of
course,
he
might
have
won.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
might
have
won
his
suppression
motion.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
you
are
suggesting
that
he
couldn't
then
sue
for
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is...
even
if
you
lose
this
case,
that
defense
would
still
be
there,
good
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
state's
consent
necessary
to
accept
a
guilty
plea
in
virginia?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
pled
guilty
here.
did
he
have
to
have
the
consent
of
the
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
prosecution
can't
say,
we
are
going
to
go
to
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
way
we
can
examine
that
decision
ourselves?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
we
thought
it
was
very
relevant
to
the
issue,
different
from
you,
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
know
about
it.
well,
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
suppose
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
decided
this
case,
the
virginia
supreme
court
decided
and
published
an
opinion
in
a
case
right
in
the
teeth
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
thought
virginia
law
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
there
is
preclusion.
suppose
that
had
happened.
i
would
think
we
would
probably
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
reconsider
the
case
in
the
light
of
what
has
been
declared
to
be
the
virginia
law,
wouldn't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
this
case
then?
was
it
cited
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
can't...
let's
suppose
you
agreed
that
souders
was
right
on,
and
that
it
was
contrary
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
virginia
law
was.
let's
just
suppose
that,
and
it
wasn't
cited
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
remand.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
he
have
then
made
a
motion
to
suppress?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
state
would
perhaps
rather
have
no
exclusionary
rule
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
if
the
fourth
amendment
means
anything
there
would
be
suits
for
unlawful
searches.
