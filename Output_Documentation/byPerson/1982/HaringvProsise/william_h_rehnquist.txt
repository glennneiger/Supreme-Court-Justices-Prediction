justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lasso,
i
take
it
there
was
no
motion
to
suppress
in
the
circuit
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lasso,
do
you
think
that
the
absence
of
a
motion
to
suppress
played
any
part
in
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
you
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
does
it
reserve
the
question
as
to
whether
there
would
be
preclusion
had
there
been
a
suppression
hearing,
or
does
it
say
there
would
have
been
preclusion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
prosise
sentenced
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lasso,
i
can
see
how
someone
who
perhaps
faced
a
sentence
of
30
days
or
60
days
for
the
offense
charged
might
seek
to
avoid
stone
against
powell
by
simply
pleading
guilty
and
figure
he'd
get
his
hearing
on
the
search
and
seizure
question
in
a
1983
action
in
the
federal
court,
but
in
a
pending
sentence
of
20
or
25
years,
you
would
think
that
would
be
far
more
important
in
the
eyes
of
an
accused
than
some
rather
putative
recovery
in
a
damages
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
fourth
circuit
focused
in
its
analysis
of
preclusion
on
incentive
to
litigate.
did
they
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
accused
here
had
no
incentive
to
litigate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
that
is
the
hope
of
every
defendant,
i
suppose.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
all
fields
of
law.
get
rid
of
it
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
don't
waste
your
time
with
a
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
know
of
any
authority
that
allows
the
setting
aside
of
a
guilty
plea
in
a
1983
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
fourth
circuit
rely
on
that
aspect
of
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
townsend,
supposing
we
were
simply
talking
about
diversity
of
jurisdiction
here,
and
it
wasn't
a
1983
case
at
all.
do
you
think
that
the
federal
court
sitting
in
alexandria
would
be
bound
by
a
circuit
court
decision
on
virginia
state
law
if
there
were
no
controlling
precedent
from
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
souders
is
no
closer
even
if
it
were
a
supreme
court
of
virginia
decision
on
the
merits,
than
the
cases
you
have
cited?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
townsend,
do
you
see
the
inquiry
to
be
made
by
a
court
of
appeals
or
a
district
court
here
in
determining
what
state
law
is
for
purposes
of
preclusion
to
be
any
different
than
the
inquiry
of
a
state...
of
a
federal
court
sitting
in
a
diversity
case
trying
to
ascertain
what
state
law
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
so
far
as
preclusion
is
concerned,
i
gather
that
the
focus
of
the
fourth
circuit
and,
i
take
it,
the
focus
of
your
argument
here
that
virginia
law
is
such
and
such
is...
the
object
is
to
find
out
what
virginia
law
is.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you--
--mr.
townsend...
oh,
excuse
me.
i
was
just
trying
to...
this
side
of
the
bench
was
trying
to
get
a
question
over
there.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
townsend,
was
the
grounds
upon
which
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
on
the
fourth
amendment
claim
solely
collateral
estoppel,
or
was
it
both
collateral
estoppel
and
on
the
merits
of
the
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
district
court
didn't
grant
summary
judgment
on
the
merits
of
the
fourth
amendment
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
townsend,
what
if
the
fourth
circuit
is
affirmed
here
and
your
case
goes
to
trial
and
your
client
is
still
in
jail,
and
the
virginia
authorities
say,
you
know,
that
he
doesn't
have
parole
coming,
he
can't
get
out
of
jail?
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
it
comes
to
calling
witnesses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
happened
to
the
20-year
term?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
testificanum.
