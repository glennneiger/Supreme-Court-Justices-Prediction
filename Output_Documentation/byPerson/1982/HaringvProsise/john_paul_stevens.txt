justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
would
make
the
same
basic
argument
if
you
had
a
case
in
which
there
were,
say,
two
different
sets
of
evidence
that
supported
the
guilty
plea,
one
of
which
was...
there
was
no
challenge
to
the
legality
of
the
seizure,
but
as
to
some
of
the
evidence
there
was
a
question
as
to
the
legality
of
the
seizure,
and
then
he
pleaded
guilty,
and
the
undisputed
evidence
would
be
enough
to
support
the
guilty
plea,
but
he
nevertheless
files
a
1983
action
just
like
this,
saying
there
is
some
kind
of
a
constitutional
right
to
damages.
how
would
you
deal
with
that
kind
of
a
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
be
the
incentive?
it
is
just
cumulative
evidence
of
a
crime
of
which
he
is
admittedly
guilty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is
the
purpose?
i
mean,
why
should
he
make
a
judge
go
through
a
hearing
on
all
that
if
it
is
not
going
to
accomplish
anything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
is
relevant
to
a
damage
claim
and
totally
irrelevant
to
a
guilty
plea
determination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
if
he
doesn't
challenge
that.
i
am
just
saying
there
is
no
constitutional
issue
as
to
some
of
the
evidence,
and
that
is
enough
to
support
the
guilty
plea,
but
there
is
a
constitutional
issue
as
to
a
seizure
and
a
search
which
he
doesn't
want
to
bother
litigating
in
the
criminal
trial
because
there
is
no
purpose
to
it,
but
he
does
want
to
assert
a
damage
claim.
why
shouldn't
he
be
allowed
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
was
cumulative.
it
was
there,
but
he
pleaded
guilty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lasso,
may
i
ask
you
another...
you
say
he
brings
into
dispute
the
integrity
of
his
conviction,
but
i
don't
understand
that
any
of
the
relief
he
could
possibly
get
here
would
set
aside
the
guilty
plea,
would
it?
he
is
asking
for
damages.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
will
stay
in
jail
no
matter
what
happens,
as
i
understand
the
record,
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
even
if
he
wins
he
stays
in
jail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
would
agree
with
you
it
is
unlikely
he
is
going
to
recover
that,
and
i
would
also
think--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
would
be
unlikely
that
the
time
in
jail
will
be
an
element
of
damage.
i
don't
think
that's
an
element
of
damage.
but
suppose
you
have
an
excessive
force
situation
or
something
like
that,
which
he
alleged
here,
but
there
was
no
merit
to
it,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
they
beat
him
up.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
should
that
be
foreclosed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
could
have
an
excessive...
say
you
have
a
coerced
confession
case,
and
he
alleged
that
he
was
maltreated
in
order
to
get
the
confession,
and
then
he
goes
ahead
and
enters
a
guilty
plea
on
the
ground
that
there
is
additional
evidence
of
guilt.
could
he
sue
under
1983
for
the
physical
harm
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
why
is
that
different
from
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
waived
it
in
the
criminal
trial.
by
pleading
guilty,
he
waived
any
objection
to
the
confession
in
my
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
that
be
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
he
thinks
there
is
other
evidence
of
guilt
and
he
would
rather
plead
guilty
and
get
the
criminal
trial
over
again?
how
does
the
state
benefit
from
such
a
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
are
only
asking
us
to
decide
the
case
in
which
all
the
evidence
supporting
the
guilty
plea
was
the
subject
matter
of
the
search?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
wanted
to
ask
you...
i
thank
you,
brother
marshall...
is
it
not
a
fact
that
in
the
souders
case
the
plea
of
guilty
was
to
assault
and
battery
of
a
police
officer,
which
was
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
civil
claim
of
excessive
force,
so
that
that
case
is
quite
different
from
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
here,
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
with
the
plea
of
guilty
to
possession
of
controlled
substances
and
still
having
an
illegal
search,
but
there
it
seems
to
me
it
is...
i
don't
know
why
we
have
to
wrestle
with
that
case.
