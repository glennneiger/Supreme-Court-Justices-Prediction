mr.
norman
a.
townsend
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
fundamental
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
become
the
sole
and
exclusive
remedy
for
intentional
fourth
amendment
violations
in
instances
when
the
search
in
question
resulted
in
the
seizure
of
evidence
or
contraband.
petitioners
argue
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
abandoned
settled
law
to
create
a
remedy
benefitting
only
convicted
felons.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
he
was,
your
honor.
but
in
volume
1,
which
is
the
pleadings
filed
in
this
court,
tab
13,
mr.
prosise
filed
a
memorandum
in
opposition
to
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
and
for
summary
judgment
in
which
he
has
a
section
entitled
"ineffective
assistance
of
counsel".
the
last
sentence
in
that--
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
--yes,
sir.
and
in
the
last
sentence
of
that--
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
--yes,
sir.
he
stated,
and
i
quote,
"plaintiff
states
that
he
never
had
adequate
assistance
of
counsel
throughout
his
pretrial,
trial,
and
post-trial
procedures.
"
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
he
is
not
attempting
to
set
aside
the
guilty
plea,
your
honor.
i
think
that
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
adequate
incentive
to
litigate,
or
whether
the
procedures
leading
to
the
guilty
plea
were
adequate.
he
was
stating
that
the
reason
that
no
search
and
seizure
issue
was...
i
mean,
motion
was
raised
at
the
trial
level
was
because
he
was
ineffectively
assisted
by
trial
counsel.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
the
court
did
not
at
all
rely
on
that.
your
honor,
allen
versus
mccurry,
i
think,
settled
the
question
that
under
collateral
estoppel,
once
a
court
has
decided
an
issue
of
fact
or
law
that
is
actually
necessary
to
the
judgment,
that
the
decision
may
preclude,
not
does
automatically,
but
may
preclude
relitigation
of
that
issue
in
a
subsequent
civil
rights
action.
but
in
allen
this
court
reserved
the
question
of
whether
it
precludes
issues
not
actually
raised
and
litigated.
the
court
also
disclaimed
fashioning
any
new,
more
stringent
variety
of
collateral
estoppel
for
1983
cases
raising
fourth
amendment
issues.
at
the
same
time,
the
court
disclaimed
that
it
was
creating
a
rule
of
collateral
estoppel
that
turns
on
the
single
question
of
whether
the
1983
plaintiff
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
the
question
in
state
court.
rather,
the
court
stated
that
they
were
merely...
that
you
were
merely
applying
the
conventional
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel.
that
conventional
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
has
been
established
in
federal
court
since
1876,
in
the
case
of
cromwell
versus
sack
county,
and
the
court...
and
petitioners
in
this
case
are
asking
this
court
to
disturb
well-settled
collateral
estoppel
law
by
abandoning
the
rule
that
the
issue
must
have
been
actually
litigated
in
the
trial
court
and
that
the
decision
was
necessary
to
that
judgment.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
that
a
factual
basis
exists
for
the
elements...
finding
the
elements
of
the
offense.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
no,
they
waived
valid
defenses.
tollett
versus
henderson
would
seem
to
imply
that
there
is...
although
tollett
is
not
exactly
a
waiver
case,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
menna,
but
that
those
then
become
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
factual
guilt.
mr.
prosise
is
not
challenging
his
factual
guilt.
rather,
he
is
seeking
to
litigate
a
separate,
entirely
separate
question,
that
is,
whether
aside
from
his
guilt
of
the
underlying
offense,
another
violation
of
law
occurred
by
the
police
officers
in
this
instance.
i
would
also
point
out
that
petitioners
seem
to
have
conceded
in
their
argument
that
were
there
untainted
evidence
in
the
case
to
support
the
guilty
plea,
that
their
position
would
be
that
they
were
not
precluded
from
litigating
that
question.
i
would
point
out
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
there
was
in
fact
untainted
evidence
sufficient
to
support
a
factual
finding
of
guilt
in
this
case.
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
24
is
reproduced
the
search
warrant
affidavit,
and
in
the
search
warrant
affidavit
it
indicates
that
after
arresting
mr.
prosise
for
the
domestic
dispute
that
prompted
the
police
in
coming
to
his
apartment
in
the
first
instance,
that
they
patted
him
down
as
a
search
incident
to
the
arrest
and
found
phencyclidine
in
his
pocket.
also,
having
disarmed
him
in
the
house,
his
fiance
with
whom
he
was
having
the
dispute
told
the
officers
that
mr.
prosise
was
manufacturing
pcp.
so,
together
with
the
phencyclidine
found
in
his
pocket
and
the
statements
of
his
fiance,
there
was
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
aside
from
the
evidence
seized
by
going
through
the
closets
of
mr.
prosise's
house
with
which
to
support
a
finding
of
guilt.
i
would
point
out
that
this
court
made
very
clear
in
allen
that
28
usc
1738
controls,
that
virginia
law
as
a
result
must
be
looked
to
to
determine
the
preclusive
effect
of
the
guilty
plea
in
this
case.
petitioners
have
relied
to
a
great
extent
in
their
reply
brief
and
today
in
oral
argument
on
the
denial
of
the
writ
of
error
in
souders
versus
gabrielson.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
brunswick
county
versus
peebles
and
purdy,
which
is
reported
at
138
virginia
348,
the
supreme
court
said,
and
i
will
quote
very
briefly,
"the
effect
of
the
refusal
of
the
writ
of
error
in
the
former
case
was
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
that
particular
case,
but
the
refusal
of
the
writ
did
not
decide
the
question
in
any
other
case.
"
in
fact,
the
law
of
virginia--
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
--no,
it
was
not.
that
is
the
decision
that
was
rendered,
your
honor,
in
1924,
by
the
virginia
supreme
court.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
particularly
in
light
of
the
question...
in
light
of
the
fact
that
virginia
law,
although
there
is
no
supreme
court
case
particularly
on
the
question
of
suppression
of
evidence,
neither
is
there
a
circuit
court
case
dealing
with
that.
petitioners
have
pointed
to
souders,
which
is
not
a
suppression
of
evidence
case.
that
is
a
case
involving
excessive
force,
which
is
also
a
fourth
amendment
case
as
well
as
a
due
process
case,
but
it
does
not
involve
the
suppression
of
evidence.
i
don't...
getting
back--
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
--it
would
be
a
closer
question,
to
be
sure,
had
it
been
rendered
by
the
united...
i
mean,
by
the
virginia
supreme
court,
because
it
is
a
fourth
amendment
question
in
some
respects,
although
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
looking
for
an
issue
dealing
with
the
admissibility
of
evidence
on
fourth
amendment
grounds,
and
this...
the
court...
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
very
carefully
to
narrowly
construe
or
narrowly
answer
that
particular
question
and
no
other
question.
it
specifically
reserved
the
question
of
whether
any
1983
issue
might
be
precluded,
and
whether
issue
elements
might
be
precluded
because
there
was
no
virginia
supreme
court
on
point.
so,
even
though
souders
may
have
been
decided
by
the
virginia
supreme
court,
because
it
did
not
involve
the
particular
question
that
the
fourth
circuit
was
looking
at,
which
is
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
then
it
probably,
although
the
fourth
circuit
probably
would
have
given
that
such
persuasive
effect
that
they
may
have
reached
a
differing
result
than
they
did,
it
is
not
certainly
controlling.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
the
souders
decision,
your
honor?
well,
it
is
in
the
record
of
the
virginia
supreme
court.
i
believe
that
it
was...
i
believe
that
the--
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
--well,
i
believe
that--
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
--i
think
that
that
would
probably
be
the
result.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
not
that
i
am
aware
of.
no,
sir.
but
i
would
point
out
that
on
questions
of
interpretation
of
state
law,
that
this
court
has
generally
accepted
the
interpretation
reached
by
the
court
below.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
it
was
or
was
not?
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
i
would
think
that
if
it
were
on
all
fours,
the
court
would
probably
be
required--
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
--or
would
probably
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
that
decision,
but
i
would
point
out
again
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
expressly
said
that
denial
of
writ
of
error
is
a
discretionary
review,
and
such
denials
have
no
precedential
effect.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
i
believe
that
there
is
some
difference
in
the
fact
that
a
1983
action
is
different
than
a
diversity
action.
a
1983
action
has
a
special
status
in
the
law
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
i
believe
that
if
this
court...
our
position
is
that
the
virginia
law
is
settled
that
criminal
convictions,
whether
by
plea
or
by
trial,
have
no
collateral
estoppel
effect
in
virginia.
however,
if
the
court
were
to
agree
with
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
that
question
remains
unsettled,
then
the
court
may
look
to
general
rules
of
collateral
estoppel
which
reach
the
same
result
as
the
court
of
appeals
said.
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
fashioning
any
new
law
to
benefit
these
defendants,
but
was
merely
making
an
application
of
settled
collateral
estoppel
law.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
i
will
certainly
give
him
the
opportunity.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
it
is.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
i
don't
believe
that
we
do.
i
don't
believe
that
that
question
is
on
point.
i
don't
believe
that
it
deals
with
the
issue
that
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
looking
to
answer
that
said
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
had
not
addressed,
and
i
don't
believe
that
we
need
deal
with
souders
at
any
length
at
all.
the
virginia
rule
is
clear
that
three
factors
must
exist
in
order
for
collateral
estoppel
to
apply
that
do
not
exist
in
this
case.
that
is
that
the
issue
has
been
actually
litigated.
that
is
that
the
decision
was
necessary
to
the
judgment
below.
not
necessary
to
the
conviction,
as
petitioners
continue
to
argue.
petitioners
continue
to
argue
that
without
this
evidence,
there
could
have
been
no
conviction,
that
the
requirement
for
collateral
estoppel
is
that
without
the
litigation
of
the
question
that
mr.
prosise
now
seeks
to
litigate,
there
could
have
been
no
decision
below.
and
the
third
requirement
that
virginia
requires
is
mutuality
of
judgment.
that
is,
had
the
decision
reached
the
opposite
result,
that
the
petitioners
would
have
been
precluded.
and
it
is
clear
that
petitioners
would
not
have
been
precluded
from
defending
against
this
charge
had
the
trial
court
litigated
the
issue
and
decided
that
it
was
an
illegal
search.
so,
in
order
to
find
as
petitioners
would
have
the
court
do
on
collateral
estoppel
grounds
under
virginia
law
we
are
going...
the
court
would
have
to
abandon
those
three
requirements,
but
even
if
the
court
were
to
look
to
collateral
estoppel
law
as
established
in
the
federal
courts,
although
the
federal
courts
have
abandoned
in
park
lane
hosiery
the
requirement
of
mutuality
of
judgment,
the
federal
court
still
adhered
to
the
rule
that
the
issue
must
have
been
actually
litigated
and
necessary
to
the
decision.
i
would
point
out
that
this
court
said
that
in
briscoe
versus
lahugh,
march
7th
of
this
year,
in
a
footnote
by
justice
stevens.
it
indicated
that
were
the
question
of
perjury
of
the
police
officers
not
litigated,
the
collateral
estoppel
would
be
inappropriate,
so
as
recently
as
march
7th
of
1983,
this
court
seems
to
be
retaining
the
requirement
of
collateral
estoppel
that
the
issue
be
actually
litigated.
turning
to
the
question
of
whether
the
circuit
court
rendered
an
inflexible
rule
but
rather
we
should
look
to
incentive
to
litigate
i
would
point
out
that
that
would
be
adding
an
entirely
new
level
of
inquiry
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
in
1983
actions.
that
has
a
very
difficult...
that
is
very
difficult
to
resolve,
which
is
exactly
what
the
fourth
circuit
pointed
out.
it
would
raise
questions
of
fact
that
are
inappropriate
for
summary
judgment
disposition.
there
would
be
questions
of
what
is
the
burden
of
proof,
who
has
the
burden
of
proof,
is
there
untainted
evidence,
are
there
other
untainted
charges,
was
there
plea
bargaining
that
went
into
the
question?
i
see
it.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
thank
you.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
at
the
time
that
we
recessed,
your
honor,
we
were
speaking
about
the
difficulties
of
assessing
the
incentive
to
litigate
question
in
a
1983
action.
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
many,
many
reasons
for
pleading
guilty
aside
necessarily
from
the
factual
guilt
that
induce
individuals
in
criminal
courts
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
yes,
mr.
prosise
is
not
contesting
the
fact
that
he
is
guilty
in
fact
of--
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
--and
in
law,
and
he
is
not
contesting
the
legality
of
that
conviction,
nor
is
he
seeking
relief
from
custody.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
no,
i...
if
i
did
imply
that,
i
didn't
mean
to,
and
i
am
sorry.
i
think
this
court
has
made
clear
in
the
brady
trilogy
and
north
carolina
versus
alford
that
there
are
many
reasons
one
might
plead
guilty
aside
from
factual
guilt
so
that
if
an
actual
litigated
requirement
remains
in
the
collateral
estoppel
of
field,
that--
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
--mr.
prosise
is
not
questioning
his
factual
guilt,
but
there
are
other
individuals
besides
mr.
prosise
that
this
decision
will
impact
upon,
and
i
was
just
getting
at
the
point
that
the
court
shouldn't
adopt
an
incentive
to
litigate
analysis
or
necessarily
collaterally
estop
essential
elements
of
the
offense
because
of
the
fact
that
a
plea
by
itself
doesn't
necessarily--
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
--and
had
not
litigated
the
issues?
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
i
think
the
question
of
whether
he
would
be
precluded
then
is
already
answered
by
allen
versus
mccurry,
that
had
he
litigated
those,
he
definitely
would
be
precluded,
absent
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
that
could
then
be
established
in
the
district
court,
but
i
think
that
question
is
already
answered
clearly
by
this
court's
decision
in
allen.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
i
think
the
court
felt
that
it
was
improper
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
question
because
collateral
estoppel
being
a
defense
to
the
merits
was
more
appropriately
addressed,
and
that
the
merits
needn't
be
reached
because
mr.
prosise
didn't
have
the
right
to
bring
the
suit
in
the
first--
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
--there
was
no
collateral
estoppel
claim
made
as
to
the
excessive
force
charge.
the
collateral
estoppel
claim
was
made
as
to
the
search
and
seizure.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
i
don't
think...
well,
as
an
initial
matter,
i
think
the
district
court
misunderstood
the
allegations
of
the
fourth
amendment
issue.
the
district
court
found
that
the
search
warrant
was
valid
without
looking
at
whether
there
had
been
an
intentional
misstatement
of
fact
or
even
a
fabrication
of
the
law...
rather,
fabrication
or
alteration
of
the
crime
scene
in
order
to
establish
that.
i
believe
that
it
was
based
on
a
misinterpretation
of
the
central
allegations
in
the
1983
claim,
but--
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
--the...
i
don't
believe
there
was
a
finding
of
consent
to
the
search.
i
think
there
was
a
footnote
in
the
district
court
opinion
saying
that
it
would
appear
that
ms.
denny,
who
was
mr.
prosise's
fiance
and
living
in
the
apartment,
gave
consent,
but
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
record
in
the
district
court,
ms.
denny
filed
an
affidavit
contesting
that,
saying
that
she
did
not
in
fact
consent
to
the
search,
so
that
is
a
disputed
fact
that
would
have
to
be
resolved
aside
from
a...
on
a
summary
judgment
motion.
i
think
again
the
district
court
neglected
to
look
at
that.
i
think
the
district
court
took
the
facts
largely
from
the
affidavits
submitted
by
the
officers
in
support
of
their
summary
judgment
motion,
and
overlooked
the
affidavits
of
ms.
denny
and
the
verified
nature
of
the
complaint.
so
that
even
though
the
district
court
did
intimate
an
opinion
as
to
the
legality
of
the
search,
i
think
it
was
no
more
than
an
opinion.
i
think
it
was
erroneous,
and
with
not
the
benefit
of
looking
at
all
the
facts
on
the
case.
and
i--
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
--no,
i
believe...
it
was
not
solely
on
collateral
estoppel,
but
neither
was
it
on
collateral
estoppel
on
the
merits.
it
was
on
collateral
estoppel
and
waiver
grounds,
analyzing
the
tollett
versus
henderson
decision,
and
then
extending
the
rationale
of
tollett
versus
henderson
to
preclude
litigating
antecedent
constitutional
claims
in
a
1983
action.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
no,
the
district
court
did
not.
the
district
court
did
state
that
on
initial
looking
at
the
claims,
it
would
appear
that
the
merits...
or
looking
at
the
merits,
it
would
appear
that
the
search
was
valid,
but
i
don't
reach
that
because
he
is
collaterally
estopped
from
getting
there,
or
if
he
is
not
collaterally
estopped,
then
he
has
waived
his
right
by
pleading
guilty.
turning
to
the
waiver
question,
i
think
the
court
was
clearly
incorrect
and
rather
the
circuit
court
is
correct
that
there
was
no
waiver
arising
from
that,
that
the
rationale
for
tollett
versus
henderson
is
that
individuals
should
not
be
permitted
to
come
into
court
and
then
contest
the
fact
that
they
are
actually
guilty
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
in
an
effort
to
seek
their
release
from
custody
to
vacate
and
set
aside
the
conviction
itself.
tollett,
of
course,
was
not
a
waiver
case
at
all,
as
this
court
has
said.
tollett
was
limited
to
habeas
corpus
challenges
to
the
conviction,
and
mr.
prosise
is
not
seeking
declaratory
injunctive
relief
that
his
conviction
was
invalid,
but
rather
is
seeking
to
litigate
the
entirely
separate
question
of
whether
the
police
officers
committed
a
violation
of
the
law.
i
think
preiser
versus
rodrigez,
this
court
made
clear
that
habeas
corpus
and
money
damages
under
1983
are
entirely
separate
and
distinct
remedies,
and
that
the
policy
considerations
i
think
this
court
indicated
in
allen
itself,
the
policy
considerations
underlying
habeas
corpus
have
no
application
to
the
1983
context.
so
that
the
rationale
supporting
the
tollett
decision
precluding
individuals
from
subsequently
coming
into
court
and
contesting
the
validity
of
their
conviction
have
no
application
in
this
case.
i
think,
rather,
if
the
court
is
going
to
look
at
the
waiver
principle
in
the
case,
the
court
should
look
at
the
wainwright
versus
sykes
deliberate
bypass
considerations.
i
don't
think
that
even
in
those
cases
that
there
arises
a
waiver
from
this,
because
in
tollett
versus
henderson
the
court
said
that
where
the
individual
waives
or
bypasses
a
state
procedure
that
then
forecloses
them
from
habeas
corpus
relief,
that
you
can't
come
and
get
habeas
corpus
relief
in
state...
or,
rather,
in
federal
court.
but
that
is
inapposite
to
this
case
because
in
virginia
there
is
no
collateral
estoppel
preclusive
effect
to
a
guilty
plea
criminal
conviction
in
a
subsequent
civil
action.
the
criminal
case
and
the
civil
case
are
two
separate
things.
in
this
instance
we
have
a
deliberate
fourth
amendment
violation
alleged
by
these
officers.
petitioners
state
repeatedly
that
mr.
prosise
wants
his
cake
and
to
eat
it,
too,
that
is,
he
wants
the
benefits
of
his
plea
offer
but
still
be
able
to
come
and
litigate
a
1983
action
to
the
antecedent
fourth
amendment
violations.
respondent
would
argue
that
the
officers
want
their
cake
and
eat
it,
too.
petitioners
want
their
conviction,
but
still
want
this
court
to
insulate
them
from
a
1983
action
for
a
fourth
amendment
violation
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
conviction
or
the
finality
of
the
state
court
judgment.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
mr.
prosise,
and
he
is
not
seeking
in
any
way
to
avoid
his
guilty
plea
now,
although
he
did
initially
attempt
to
withdraw
his
guilty
plea.
when
that
was
denied
by
the
virginia
supreme
court
on
voluntariness
grounds,
he
thereafter
sought
no
further
relief
on
that
basis,
but
was
content
to
let
that
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
lie,
and
has
still
not
to
this
day,
to
my
knowledge,
sought
in
any
way
to
vacate
or
avoid
the
consequences
of
his
plea,
but
separately
is
seeking
money
damages
for
a
distinct
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
i
think
that
there
are
significant
policy
considerations
against
applying
the
tollett
waiver
rationale
to
this
case.
first
of
all,
it
would
preclude
fourth
amendment
issues
if
it
were
extended
to
1983
actions
that
had
no
relief
in
state
criminal
cases.
for
instance,
under
the
kerr
line
of
cases
coming
out
of
this
court,
where
an
individual
cannot
contest
the
legality
of
their
arrest
as
a
means
of
avoiding
prosecution,
that
is
a
distinct
fourth
amendment
violation
for
which
there
is
no
remedy
in
the
state
criminal
process.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
well,
as
a
factual
matter,
mr.
prosise
is
not
in
jail.
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
the
25-year
term
was
reduced
to
12
years,
and
under
virginia
parole
guidelines,
he
has
now
made
parole.
he
served
almost
four
years,
i
believe
it
was.
so
that
as
to
mr.
prosise's
individual
case,
it
would
present
no
problem.
as
to
instances
where
it
would
present
a
problem,
i
believe
that
a
habeas
corpus
ad
prosecutorium
or--
mr.
norman
a.
townsend
--ad
testificanum,
rather,
excuse
me,
would
permit
the
federal
court
to
bring
mr.
prosise
from
the
jail
to
the
district
court
for
resolution
of
the
problem.
the
decision
below,
i
would
submit,
is
consistent
with
the
important
governmental
concerns
in
the
enforcement
of
criminal
law.
the
purpose
of
criminal
courts
is
not
to
enforce
private
rights,
but
rather
to
vindicate
public
interest
in
enforcing
criminal
laws,
while,
of
course,
at
the
same
time
safeguarding
the
defendant's
individual
rights
by
assuring
the
reliability
of
the
conviction.
however,
fourth
amendment
questions
do
not
in
any
way
raise
into
question
the
legality
or
the
reliability
of
the
state
criminal
conviction.
i
think
that
permitting
collateral
estoppel
upon
conviction
in
1983
actions
wouldn't...
or
rather,
the
purpose
of
1983,
rather,
is
to
provide
compensation
for
injured
persons,
deterrent
to
police
officers,
and
redress
for
abridgement
of
constitutional
rights
itself.
the
deterrence
from
the...
the
deterrent
effect
as
to
fourth
amendment
violations
arises
from
a
direct
statement
to
the
constable
who
has
blundered
that
impermissible
actions
have
occurred.
an
exclusionary
ruling
by
a
trial
court
does
not
have
that
effect,
whereas
a
damage
action
against
the
police
officers
individually
would
have
a
more
direct
deterrent
effect.
i
don't
believe
that
this
harsh
result
should
obtain
in
this
case,
primarily
because
there
is
a
serious
question
about
the
incentive
to
litigate.
there
are
also
serious
questions
about
the
adequacy
of
the
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate,
especially
in
cases
such
as
this.
there
was
not
a
single
charge
arising
against
mr.
prosise.
there
were
four
charges
against
him.
he
was
facing
nearly
80
years
in
the
penitentiary.
the
state,
by
offering
a
plea
offer,
if
this
court
were
to
extend
the
reasoning
of
the
petitioners,
could
by
the
expediency
of
making
a
good
plea
offer
to
criminal
defendants,
could
insulate
the
state
entirely
from
fourth
amendment
liability
under
1983.
thank
you.
