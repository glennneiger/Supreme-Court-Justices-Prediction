chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
haring
against
prosise.
mr.
lasso,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
he
at
any
time
ever
raised
a
question
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel
or
lack
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--does
the
state
of
virginia
have
a
rule
on
guilty
pleas
comparable
to
rule
11
of
the
federal
criminal
rules
that
the
sentencing
judge
makes
an
inquiry
as
to
the
factual
basis
of
the
plea?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
one
of
your
underlying
propositions
when
you
were
talking
about
the
burden
on
the
courts
was
that
the
courts
should
not
be
burdened
with
having
to
determine
for
a
second
time
whether
this
was
or
was
not
an
unreasonable
search,
and
that
his
guilty
plea
was
a
waiver
of
any
claim
whatever
that
it
was
an
unreasonable
search.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
townsend.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
represented
by
counsel
at
the
guilty
plea,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
raising
that
in
the
1983
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
be
sure
i
have
that
clear.
he
was
raising
in
the
1983
case
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
at
the
time
of
his
guilty
plea?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
issues
in
your
view
were
litigated
on
the
guilty
plea?
what
went
into
the
guilty
plea
before
a
court
could
accept
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
there
were
no
valid
defenses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
townsend,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn't
it
the
obligation
of
the
court
as
under
rule
11
of
the
federal
system
that
a
court
will
not
accept
a
guilty
plea
unless
he
is
satisfied,
unless
the
court
is
satisfied
of
guilt
in
fact
and
in
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
got
an
intimation
that
you
were
suggesting
something
to
the
contrary
in
your
first
statement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
still
find
that
statement
inconsistent
with
your
immediately
prior
response.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
he
had
gone
to
trial
and
had
been
found
guilty.
what
would
your
position
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
he
went
to
trial,
i
assume
he
would
litigate
everything
that
he
conceivably
thought
he
could
litigate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
you
say
the
petitioners
want
their
conviction,
who
gave
them
that
conviction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
lasso?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
