marshall
but
he
wasn't
convicted
on
the
search.
he
was
convicted
on
his
own
guilty
plea.
justice
thurgood
marshall
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
fail
to
draw
the
difference
between
criminal
and
civil,
do
you
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
the
criminal
case,
when
you
end
a
criminal
case,
you
also
end
the
civil
case.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
including
the
civil
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
a
novel
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
it's
novel
to
file
a
civil
case
involving
a
criminal
prosecution.
that
has
been
done
several
times.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
estoppel
or
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
estoppel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
he
intelligently
waived
his
criminal...
his
civil
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
civil?
civilly?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
johnson
versus
zerbst
says
in
order
to
show
a
waiver
you
have
to
show
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
infer
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
your
theory
is
that
he
deliberately
gave
up
his
right
of
civil
action,
and
then
filed
a
civil
action.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
doesn't
make
sense
to
me.
if
he
gave
it
up,
why
did
he
file
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
a
different
court.
unless
the
civil
and
criminal
courts
in
virginia
are
the
same.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lasso...
excuse
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
all
the
arguments
you
are
making
here
could
be
made
to
a
jury
in
this
case,
and
i
can't
conceive
of
a
jury
bringing
in
more
than
15
cents.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
but
all
this
argument
would
be
valid
argument,
would
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
justice
stevens,
for
the
last
three
hours,
he
has
been
trying
to
get
a
question.
