mr.
david
r.
lasso
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
the
issue
of
whether
a
person
who
pleaded
guilty
in
state
court
to
making
illegal
drugs
and
who
did
not
raise
the
validity
of
the
search
that
produced
the
essential
evidence
of
that
crime
can
later
bring
an
action
under
42
united
states
code
section
1983
claiming
that
that
same
search
was
unconstitutional.
the
issue
in
this
case
can
be
stated
perhaps
even
more
narrowly.
can
the
1983
action
be
brought
even
though
the
respondent,
mr.
prosise,
had
numerous
opportunities
to
raise
the
validity
of
that
search
in
the
state
court?
can
he
bring
this
action
even
though
he
has
never
claimed
that
he
had
inadequate
counsel?
and
can
he
do
so
even
under
the
circumstances
where
he
tried
to
withdraw
his
guilty
plea,
claim
his
innocence,
and
even
then
not
raise
the
validity
of
the
search?
the
error
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
that
it
adopts
as
a
policy--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
at
no
time
was
there
a
motion
to
suppress.
as
a
policy
matter,
the
fourth
circuit
has
adopted
a
rule
which
encourages
the
accused
to
bypass
the
very
state
processes
which
are
designed
to
protect
the
important
constitutional
rights
embodied
in
the
fourth
amendment.
in
effect,
the
fourth
circuit
has
sanctioned
a
rule
which
allows
the
abuse
of
those
state
processes.
that
kind
of
flat
rule
of
non-preclusion
does
not
advance
concerns
of
finality
of
judgment,
conservation
of
judicial
resources,
avoidance
of
vexatious
litigation,
and
it
certainly
does
not
further
any
interest
of
federal-state
comity.
now,
the
essential
facts
in
this
case
are
very
straightforward.
mr.
prosise
entered
into
a
plea
agreement
with
the
commonwealth.
he
agreed
to
plead
guilty
to
the
manufacturing
of
phencyclidine,
or...
also
called
pcp
or
angel
dust,
in
exchange
for
the
dropping
of
a
charge
of
possession
of
pcp.
during
the
guilty
plea
hearing,
which
included
testimony
from
detective
allen,
who
conducted
the
search
and
obtained
the
warrant,
and
all
the
evidence
that
he
found,
the
trial
judge
said,
and
i
quote,
very
briefly,
"the
court
finds
there
is
a
sufficient
factual
basis,
and
upon
the
evidence
heard
this
morning
the
court
finds
the
defendant
guilty
of
the
manufacture
of
phenclyclidine
as
charged
in
the
indictment.
"
now,
over
a
month
later,
the
sentencing
hearing
took
place.
during
the
sentencing
hearing,
mr.
prosise
testified
in
his
own
behalf
and
began
to
claim
his
innocence.
he
claimed
that
there
was
one
essential
drug
not
found
in
his
apartment
that
would
produce
pcp.
therefore
he
was
innocent.
the
trial
judge
said,
"i
will
consider
this
as
a
motion
to
withdraw
the
guilty
plea.
"
he
said,
"i
will
deny
the
motion".
quoting
again,
very
briefly,
the
judge
said,
"the
commonwealth
had
a
good,
strong
case
that
formed
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
"
"it
was
quite
clear
if
the
defendant
had
been
exposed
to
trial,
he
would
have
been
convicted
by
a
jury.
"
again,
at
no
time
was
a
motion
to
suppress
ever
made,
and
the
lower
court
never
mentions
the
crucial
importance
that
this
search
played
in
the
conviction
of
mr.
prosise.
apparently
this
is
so
because
the
lower
court
simply
finds
such
considerations
irrelevant
to
its
new
rule
that
there
will
be
no
preclusion
whatever
in
a
guilty
plea
case
involving
a
fourth
amendment
claim.
if
that
decision--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--well,
yes,
justice
rehnquist,
it
did.
they
simply...
in
other
words,
it
was
not
litigated.
therefore
it
could
not
come
into
play
in
the
sense
of
allen
versus
mccurry,
so
they
avoided
allen
versus
mccurry
in
that
way.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
i
think
it
perhaps
reserves
that
question.
it
is
very
unclear.
it
reserves
the
question
also
of
what
happens
when
you
have
certain
affirmative
defenses
that
could
be
made,
affirmative
defenses
that
would
stop
the
prosecution
altogether.
it
avoids
that
question.
what
it
says
is
that
looking
at
the
law,
the
law
is
developing
into
one
major
determining
factor,
and
that
is
incentive
to
litigate,
and
if
a
person
has
incentive
to
litigate
in
the
lower
court
during
his
conviction,
then
there
should
be
preclusion.
however,
the
mistaken
assumption
of
the
fourth
circuit
is
that
it
simply
isn't
worth
the
effort
for
a
district
court
or
a
trial
court
to
determine
in
guilty
plea
cases
like
this
whether
or
not
there
is
incentive.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
he
was
sentenced
initially
to
25
years
in
the
state
penitentiary.
at
the
time
he
gave
his
guilty
plea,
the
judge
asked
him,
did
he
know
that
he
could
possibly
receive
40
years
in
the
state
penitentiary.
he
said
that
he
did.
he
had
been
advised.
there
isn't
any
question
in
this
case,
really,
but
that
mr.
prosise...
excuse
me,
mr.
prosise
had
every
incentive
in
the
world
to
litigate
this
search.
it
could
have
been
done
easily,
at
no
cost
to
him,
and
in
a
sense,
his
decision
to
forego
making
such
a
motion
to
suppress
is
really
tantamount,
i
would
think,
to
an
admission
that
there
would
be
no
merit
to
it.
in
any
event,
he
chose
not
to
do
so.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
no,
your
honor,
he
has
not.
now,
the
other
assumption
of
the
fourth
circuit...
there
are
two
others
which
are,
i
believe,
mistaken.
the
first
is,
is
that
this
rule
of
non-preclusion
is
somehow
consistent
with
virginia
law.
the
other
mistaken
assumption
is
that
mr.
prosise
and
persons
like
him
somehow
have
a
right
to
be
in
federal
court
at
least
one
time
to
raise
these
fourth
amendment
claims.
i
believe
that
this
court
in
allen
versus
mccurry
laid
that
assumption
to
rest
once
and
for
all.
there
is
no
universal
right
to
be
in
the
federal
court
to
litigate
fourth
amendment
claims.
the
proper
place
for
a
claim
in
this
case
to
have
been
raised
would
have
been
during
the
state
criminal
process.
now,
under
40...
i'm
sorry,
under
28
u.s.
code
section
1738,
the
virginia
law
of
preclusion
apparently
should
apply.
that
appears
to
be
the
decision
of
this
court
in
kremer
versus
chemical
construction
corporation.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
yes,
your
honor,
i
would.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
my
thought
on
that
is
that
they
are
plainly
incorrect.
one
case
that
they
never
discuss
in
that
amicus
brief
nor
in
any
of
the
briefs
filed
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
is
the
case
of
souders
versus
gabrielson.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
that's
correct.
that
case
was
found
by
me
after
the
fourth
circuit
decision.
it
was
unavailable
to
the
fourth
circuit,
but
that
decision
is
a
case
directly
on
point
that
affirmed
the
trial
court,
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
said
that
collateral
estoppel
would
apply
to
a
guilty
plea
situation.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
there
is
no
case
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
which
indicates
whether
it
would
be
given
one
particular
weight
or
another,
but
the
fact
is
is
that
it
does
exist.
admittedly,
the
fourth
circuit
didn't
have
it,
but
when
you
combine
the
holdings
in
souders
and
then
you
look
to
the
only
other
case
that
is
really
close,
which
is
eagle
star
and
british
dominions
insurance
corporation
versus
heller,
you
see
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
a
rule
which
applies
when
the
convicted
person
is
the
plaintiff.
all
of
the
other
cases
cited
by
the
respondent
and
the
amicus...
amici
do
not
refer
to
the
fact
that
all
of
those
cases
are
on
the
other
side.
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
come
up
that
the
convicted
person
is
the
plaintiff
and
he
is
trying
to
profit
from
his
own
illegal
conduct.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
i
would
think
that
we
are
commanded
to
do
that
under
18,
28,
section
1738.
in
fact,
of
course,
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
it
was
unclear,
and
it
said
that
over
and
over
again,
that
there
was
no
case,
or
at
least
a
reported
case,
directly
on
point
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
that
it
could--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--normally
it
would
defer,
but
if
you
read
the
fourth
circuit
very
carefully,
it
never
decided
what
the
virginia
supreme
court
rule
was.
it
said
that
it
was
unclear,
it
could
not
find
anything,
and
then
it
went
on
to
develop
broad
principles
of
collateral
estoppel
which
it
said
it
felt
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
would
also
accept,
and
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
would
never
accept
a
flat
rule
of
nonpreclusion
if
that
rule
would
allow
someone
like
mr.
prosise
to
bring
into
question
the
very
integrity
of
his
state
court
conviction.
there
is
no
escaping
the
fact
in
this
case
but
that
if
mr.
prosise
is
allowed
to
pursue
his
claim
under
section
1983,
he
will
question
the
integrity
of
that
conviction.
the
search
that
he
seeks
to
litigate
is
the
search
that
produced
the
evidence
of
the
crime.
it
is
not
a
search
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
he
was
convicted
on
his
own
guilty
plea,
but--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--he
was
convicted
on
that,
but
he...
but
during
that
time,
the
fact,
the
evidence
that
was
available
was
the
evidence
that
was
produced
by
the
search.
was
it...
were
it
not
for
that
evidence,
he
would
never
have
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
david
r.
lasso
there
is
a...
there
is
a
very
brief
factual
inquiry.
now,
the
rule
requires
that
the
plea
has
to
be
determined
to
be
voluntary
and
intelligent.
it
doesn't
require
that
you
put
on...
actually
put
on
evidence.
but
the
factor
here
is
is
that
that
evidence
was
presented
to
the
court.
it
was
brought
up,
and
the
trial
judge
found
that
that
was
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea,
so
this
case
can
be
very
much
narrower
than
that,
being
that
there
was
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
it
presents
a
difficult
question.
the
question,
even
if
the
fourth
circuit's
rule
was
adopted,
in
a
sense,
that
aspect
of
it
which
is
incentive
to
litigate,
you
could
inquire
nonetheless
into
the
incentive
to
litigate
that
other
search.
in
other
words,
was
there
still
some
evidence--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--well,
the
position
would
be
that
he
should
nonetheless,
if
there
is
evidence
there
that
is
at
all
important,
then
he
should
raise
that
at
the
first
opportunity.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
well,
the
next
question
is,
why
should
he
deliberately
bypass
that
opportunity
and
then
litigate
it
later
and
not
be--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--if
that
position
were
taken,
then
that
would
at
least
eliminate
the
second
search.
in
other
words,
he
would
be
precluded
on
the
second
search,
which
was
essential
evidence
of
the
crime,
and
at
least
you
would
have
a
rule--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--if
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
conviction,
if
the
evidence
was--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--then
an
argument
would
be,
you
could
then
again
look
to
state
law
if
it
were
clear,
but
perhaps
that
is
one
instance
when
that
search
might
be
litigated
in
a
1983
action.
now,
another
consideration
would
be
this
aspect
of
waiver
that
has
been
commented
on
heavily
in
my
briefs.
the
trial
judge,
judge
bryan,
looked
at
the
case
of
tollett
versus
henderson,
and
in
that
case
he
was
faced
with
a
situation
where
it
was
clear
that
antecedent
constitutional
infirmities
could
not
be
raised
when
someone's
very
liberty
was
at
stake,
and
he
had
to
ask
himself
the
question
of
whether
it
made
sense
to
then
say
that
although
you
can't
seek
your
liberty,
you
could
then
seek
money
damages.
now,
tollett
versus
henderson
is
admittedly
a
habeas
corpus
case.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
and
it
is
stretching
to
case
to
say
that
it
ends
every
inquiry
here,
ends
all
prior
unconstitutional
conduct,
but
there
is
an
underlying
policy
consideration,
it
seems
to
me,
in
tollett
that
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
kinds
of
issues
like
fourth
amendment
claims,
they
should
be
raised
during
the
state
process,
and
if
they
are
not
raised,
and
if
you
take
advantage
of
the
plea
bargain,
there
shouldn't
be
a
time
when
you
can
later
come
back
and
raise
those
claims.
at
some
point
finality
must
attach,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
policy
consideration
of
tollett.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
i
am
saying
that
the
policy
consideration
is
similar.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
justice
marshall,
i
am
saying
that
during
the
criminal
case,
all
inquiries
into
the
claims
that
were
relevant
to
that
criminal
case
should
be
ended.
there
should
be
finality.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
including
the
civil
case,
because
if
you
don't--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--well,
this
case
is
novel.
this
is
the
first
time
this
comes
up.
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
novel
proposition
to
suggest--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--well,
i
am
sure
it
has.
the
question
is,
is
what
kinds
of
claims
should
be
ended,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
kind
of
claim
that
should
be
ended
at
the
very
least
is
the
kind
of
claim
mr.
prosise
makes
here
when
he
seeks
to
attack
the
search
that
produced
the
very
evidence
of
his
crime.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
excuse
me,
justice--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--it
is
like
estoppel.
it
has
been...
the
fourth
circuit
just
dismissed
it
out
of
hand
and
said
waiver
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
in
fact,
waiver
has
something
to
do.
that
same
court--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--i
think
he
intelligently
and
voluntarily
waived
any
right
to
claim
that
the
search
and
seizure
was
illegal.
i--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--i
think
it
has
got
to
apply
to
that.
there
is...
i
think
the
rule...
that
is
the
position
that
was
suggested
by
the
respondent,
that
at
some
point
there
has
to
somehow
be
an
inquiry
of
the
defendant,
do
you
waive
perhaps
all
of
your
claims
under
1983,
or
some
other
statute.
i
don't
think
that's
necessary,
and
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--well,
what
johnson--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--excuse
me,
justice
marshall.
what
i
believe
johnson
versus
zerbst
says
is
that
there
must
be
an
intelligent
relinquishment
of
a
known
right.
johnson
versus
zerbst
does
not
say
that
every
conceivable
cause
of
action,
if
it
is
statutory
or
common
law,
has
to
be
outlined.
i
think
it
is...
there
doesn't
need
to
be
some
litany
recited
to
the
defendant
that
he
is
waiving
all
conceivable
claims.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
that's
correct.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
if
it
gave
it
up
is
exactly
right.
if
he
gave
it
up
and
in
a
sense
admitted
that
there
was
no
merit
to
it,
why
should
the
court
spend
its
time
litigating
that
fourth
amendment
claim
now?
what
does
he
seek
to
gain?
in
his--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--it
is
a
different
court,
but
what
he
seeks
to
bring
into
question
is
the
integrity
of
his
conviction.
what
we
are
really
asking
here
is
a
sensible
rule
of
judicial
administration,
conserving
precious
judicial
resources.
why
should
he--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--he
is
asking
for
damages--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--well,
he
should
stay
in
jail,
because--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--that's
correct.
however,
when
these
types
of
claims
are
brought,
what
he
has
asked
for
in
his
relief
in
joint
appendix
page
12
and
13
is,
he
asks
for
relief
in
the
amount
of
$2,725,000,
claiming
that
the
conviction
has
ruined
the
rest
of
his
life,
and
for
the
worry
he
is
going
through
while
he
spends
his
time
in
the
penitentiary.
it
is
clear--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--it
is
very
unlikely.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
that's
correct,
and
excessive--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--an
excessive--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--i
am
sorry.
justice
stevens,
an
excessive
force
issue
would
be
under
the
due
process
clause.
that
could
be
taken
up
separately.
but
the
question
of
whether
the
search
was
legal,
whether
there
was
probable
cause,
that
is--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--physical
harm,
perhaps,
but
that's...
but
that's--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--but
the
physical
harm
is
the
due
process
claim.
the
physical
harm--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--the
issue
that--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--excuse
me.
the
issue
you
are
raising
is
not
the
coerced
confession.
in
other
words,
if
he
has
a
claim
of
a
coerced
confession,
and
that
the
confession
should
not
be...
come
in
as
evidence
in
his
crime,
then
he
should
litigate
that
claim
when
there
is
a
process
available
to
him--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--the
state...
well,
again,
that
goes
beyond
the
facts
here,
because
here,
it
is
not
an
issue
that
has
only
cumulative
effect
or
some
peripheral
effect.
it
is
an
issue
that
is
the
crime.
it
is
the
evidence
of
the
crime.
and
i
am
saying
that
you
can
take
this
case
and
look
at
it
very
narrowly,
start
with
the
proposition
that
that
issue
should
be
litigated
when
he
is
in
state
court,
when
he
has
got
a
process
available
to
him.
he
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
abuse
that
process
and
say,
i
choose
not
to
litigate
it
here,
i
am
going
to
somehow
adjourn
later
and
litigate
that
claim
for
damages
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
well,
essential
evidence.
i
am
saying
if
you
use
the
approach
even
that
the
fourth
circuit
itself
suggested,
which
is
incentive
to
litigate,
if
you
take
a
flexible
position
here,
you
can
have
a
court
very
easily
look
at
the
record,
see
what
the
incentive
to
litigate
the
issue
is,
and
if
there
is
incentive
to
litigate,
then
that
issue
should
be
precluded.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
i
couldn't
agree
more,
justice
rehnquist,
and
that
is
the
point
of
this
case.
those
are
the
facts
we
have
here.
forty
years
in
the
penitentiary.
why
didn't
he
raise
that
claim
which,
had
he
been
successful,
he
wouldn't
have
been
convicted?
there
would
have
been
no
evidence.
an
inquiry
like
that
could
have
been
made
by
a
trial
court
and
a
decision
reached
very
easily,
and
that
is
at
least
a
flexible
rule.
the
fourth
circuit
was
not
satisfied
with
that,
though.
the
fourth
circuit
used
the
cliche,
the
game
is
not
worth
the
candle.
in
other
words,
don't
even
take
the
effort
to
look
back
at
the
record.
and
yet
earlier
in
that
same
opinion
it
said,
well,
there
are...
sometimes
this
can
be
done
easily.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
they
seem
to
suggest
that.
but
they
ultimately
don't
have
to
base
it
on
that
holding,
because
they
find,
they
said
in
the
run
of
1983
cases,
this
kind
of
inquiry
simply
isn't
going
to
be
worthwhile.
i--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--i
am
sorry.
i
was
just
going
to
say,
i
would
suggest
that
the
inquiry
is
worthwhile.
it
could
have
in
this
case
eliminated
trial
on
that
search
and
seizure
issue.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
well,
i
would
think
a
jury
would
bring
in
nothing--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--well,
except
for
one
thing.
if
the
jury
brought
in
15
cents,
that
is
a
prevailing
judgment.
officers
would
then
be
faced
with
at
least
perhaps
paying
attorney's
fees,
and
that
is
the
kind
of
anomaly
you
want
to
avoid.
why
litigate
it
at
all?
why
not
dispose
of
it
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
as
was
done
here,
and
then
you
don't
waste
your
time
in
a
jury
trial?
now--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--oh,
i
am
sure.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
that's
correct,
and
that
was
my
hope
here.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
david
r.
lasso
pardon
me,
justice?
mr.
david
r.
lasso
had
he
won
his
suppression
motion,
we
would
then
be
faced
with
the
question
of
what
preclusive
effect,
if
anything,
should
be
given
to
winning.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--in
a
1983
case,
and
is
not
necessarily
brought
up
during
the
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
that's
correct.
that's
what
i'm
saying,
that
it
then
becomes
a
more
difficult
question
of
what
happens
when
you
win
a
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
i
think
that's
correct,
and
in
fact
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
case
of
cramer
versus
crutchfield
reached
that
conclusion.
it
said
that
a
claim
of
malicious
prosection,
which
in
that
particular
case
turned
upon
a
search
and
seizure
question,
that
that
search
and
seizure
issue
had
been
waived.
despite
that
holding
in
cramer
versus
crutchfield,
they
again
dismissed
out
of
hand
any
notion
of
waiver.
i
have
reserved
five--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
david
r.
lasso
to
plead
guilty?
no,
he
has
a
right
to
plead
guilty,
but
he
engaged.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
no.
he
could...
he
didn't
have
to
plead
guilty.
he
chose
to
plead
guilty.
he
took
advantage
of
a
plea
agreement.
and
that
was
that.
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
should
be
reversed,
and
the
case
should
be
dismissed.
thank
you.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
mr.
chief
justice,
a
few
brief
remarks
on
rebuttal.
the
point
was
made
that
he
had
no
opportunity.
i
don't
think
that
claim
can
be
taken
seriously.
there
is
no
question
here
but
that
he
had
opportunity
to
make
a
motion
to
suppress.
i
think
it
also
overlooks
the
fact
of
the
ease
with
which
a
motion
to
suppress
could
have
made.
there
is
nothing
complicated
or
difficult
about
making
a
motion
to
suppress.
the
other
point
made,
which
hints,
and
it
was
in
response
to
a
question
by
the
chief
justice,
was
the
anomaly
that
will
be
created
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
trial
situation,
and
that
is,
if
a
person
goes
to
trial
and
litigates
the
claim,
then
the
respondent
would
say
that
he
is
precluded.
however,
what
happens
if
that
same
person
goes
to
trial,
does
not
litigate
the
claim,
what
happens
to
that
fourth
amendent
issue?
the
fourth
circuit
said
in
cramer
versus
crutchfield
that
is
a
waiver.
he
cannot
litigate
that
fourth
amendment
claim.
so
the
question
is,
what
is
the
difference
between
cramer
versus
crutchfield
when
you
have
a
trial
and
you
don't
raise
the
claim,
and
here,
when
you
have
a
plea
of
guilty
and
you
don't
raise
the
claim?
the
police
officers
would
submit
that
there
is
no
practical
difference.
there
is
no
question
but
that
in
each
instance
a
court
can
look
and
determine
the
incentive
to
litigate,
and
here,
he
had
40
years
facing
him.
he
had
every
incentive
in
the
world.
he
could
have
litigated
that
issue.
he
chose
not
to
do
so,
and
the
federal
courts
should
not
then
be
burdened
with
litigating
before
a
jury
the
question
of
a
search
when
it
could
have
been
litigated
easily
in
the
state
court
processes.
what
needs
to
be
clarified
here
is,
this
is
a
plea
of
guilty
to
manufacturing
pcp.
it
is
not
a
plea
to
possession.
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
argued
that
there
was
sufficient
other
evidence
here
of
manufacturing
simply
because
his
fiance
in
a
fit
of
emotion
said,
he
is
making
pcp.
the
trial
judge
said
very
clearly
when
the
plea
was
made,
the
factual
basis
of
the
plea
this
morning
that
i
am
accepting
is
what
i
have
heard
today,
and
that
was
the
evidence
produced
by
the
search.
later,
mr.
prosise
tried
to
withdraw
that
plea.
he
tried
to
assert
his
innocence,
and
the
trial
judge
said,
once
again,
i
will
not
allow
you
to
withdraw
your
plea
because
i
have
already
heard
sufficient
factual
basis
to
find
you
guilty,
and
that
is
the
evidence
of
the
search.
so,
there
is
no
question
here
but
that
that
evidence
was
crucial,
it
was
important,
and
that
is
what
he
was
convicted
on.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
it
may
be
that
at
that
point...
it
was
the
sentencing
hearing.
it
may
have
been
too
late,
but
he
never
even
raised
that
issue.
once
again,
he
failed
to
make
the
point
that
the
search
was
illegal.
if
he
ever
claimed
that,
why
didn't
he
make
it?
what
this
case
really
presents
is
a
fundamental
policy
question.
should
this
court
endorse
a
rule
which
encourages
litigants
like
mr.
prosise
to
deliberately
bypass
the
opportunities
afforded
to
him
in
the
state
criminal
process?
those
same
opportunities
are
designed
to
protect
his
civil
rights.
they
would
allow
him
in
the
criminal
context
to
challenge
the
conduct
of
the
police
officers.
mr.
david
r.
lasso
i
am
sure
many
people
would
support
the
taking
away
of--
mr.
david
r.
lasso
--that's
correct.
the
fact
is,
however,
the
exclusionary
rule
does
exist,
but
if
it
didn't
exist,
we
would
then
be
left
under
1738
to
in
a
sense
begin
to
look
closer
at
state
law,
what
will
the
states
do
if
the
federal
court
eliminates
the
exclusionary
rule?
the
state
courts...
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
in
conclusion,
i
would
simply
ask
this
court
to
adopt
a
rule
of
judicial
administration
that
will
preclude
mr.
prosise
from
bringing
his
claim
and
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
fourth
circuit.
thank
you.
