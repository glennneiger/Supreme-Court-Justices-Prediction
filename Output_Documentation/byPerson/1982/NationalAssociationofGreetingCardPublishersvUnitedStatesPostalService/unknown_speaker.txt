the
result
is
that
the
postal
service,
which
is
really
the
only
party
able
to
do
the
variability
studies,
has
attributed
a
relatively
small
percentage
of
the
costs
of
operating
the
postal
service.
in
the
early
proceedings,
it
was
half.
then
dropped
to
45
percent.
now,
with
long-term
variable
costs
considered,
it
is
up
around
65
percent.
but
perhaps
that
is
an
outgrowth
of
their
perception
of
the
degree
of
proof
that
is
required
more
than
it
is
a
difference
on
what
the
statute
requires.
