does
united
parcel
service
run
its
business
quite
differently
than
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
really
care
about
what
happens
to
first
class
mail,
do
you?
you
are
worried
that
parcel
post
will
compete
more
effectively
with--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
unilaterally
increasing,
mr.
perlman?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
unilaterally,
then,
the
board
of
governors
acting
without
consent
or
approval
of
the
rate
commission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
only
one
way
to
handle
these
nine
factors?
you
seem
to
be
going
through
them
and
saying,
this
is
the
way
to
do
this,
this
is
the
way
to
do
that.
i
would
have
thought
the
board
of
governors
would
have
had
a
good
deal
of
discretion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
garvey,
i
think
you
said
the
statute
says
that
the
commission
shall
make
the
rates
fair
and
equitable.
are
you
referring
to
subsection
1
where
it
says
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
a
fair
and
equitable
schedule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
refers
to
schedule
of
rates?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
garvey,
you
have
answered
several
questions
about
short-term
costs
and
volume-variable
costs.
is
it
the
government's
position
that
those
terms
are
simply
words
of
art
which
allow
of
only
one
meaning,
either
something
is
a
short-term
cost
or
it
isn't,
or
that
the
postal
authorities
have
some
discretion
in
administering
the
act
to
define
those
costs
perhaps
in
a
way
different
than
someone
else
might?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
in
the
example
you
just
gave
of
the
postman
going
around
the
letter
route
and
the
post
office
saying
it
shouldn't
be
attributed--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--because
it
is
a
fixed
cost,
as
you
call
it,
supposing
there
was...
someone
else
comes
in
and
says,
well,
under
my
theory
of
accounting,
that
is
not
a
fixed
cost,
and
the
court
were
to
conclude,
well,
you
could
go
either
way
on
this
thing.
you
know,
the
protesters
have
something
to
say
for
them,
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
postal
service
seems
to
have
something
to
say,
too.
is
that
the
kind
of
decision
that
a
court
ought
to
defer
to
the
postal
commission
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
no
reason
why
the
postal
service
should
feel
obliged
to
follow
the
decision
of
one
of
eleven
courts
of
appeals,
when
its
actions
can
be
reviewed
in
all
eleven?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
read
them,
and
i
didn't
find
any
reluctance.
