mr.
bernard
g.
segal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
rate-making
provisions
of
the
postal
reorganization
act
of
1970,
which
eliminated
the
post
office
department
and
transferred
its
functions
to
the
united
states
postal
service.
since
the
new
agency
was
to
operate
the
first
class
letter
monopoly
as
well
as
provide
classes
of
mail
competitive
with
enterprises
in
the
private
sector,
congress
enacted
unique
rate-making
provisions
designed
to
prevent
the
postal
service
from
utilizing
the
monopoly
power,
by
overcharging
first
class
mail
users,
and
subsidizing
other
classes
of
mail.
i
shall
discuss
the
statutory
language
which
seeks
to
effectuate
this
congressional
purpose
by
requiring
that
the
rates
for
each
class
of
mail
recover
the
costs
caused
by
the
class.
mr.
perlman,
counsel
for
the
other
petitioner,
will
demonstrate
that
the
legislative
history
confirms
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
initially,
i
note
a
very
substantial
concession
made
by
the
postal
service
in
this
court.
the
postal
service
had
participated
in
persuading
the
second
circuit
to
rule
that
the
act
does
not
require
long-term,
but
calls
only
for
short-term
costing,
variable
costing.
by
virtue
of
this
holding,
the
$3
billion
of
cost
which
formerly
had
been
attributed
to
various
classes
of
mail
can
now
be
shifted
to
the
first
class
mail
monopoly,
this
by
virtue
of
the
decision.
now,
the
postal
service,
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
this
court,
concedes
that
costs
vary
with
volume
in
the
long
run,
and
must
be
attributed
that
way.
although
four
respondents
still
adhere
to
the
view,
nevertheless,
the
language
of
the
statute
clearly
compels
the
concession,
and
calls
for
reversal
of
the
second
circuit
decision.
despite
the
concession,
the
postal
service
still
improperly
limits
attributable
costs.
the
postal
service
says
that
attributable
costs
are
only
those
costs
that
can
be
proven
by
statistics
to
vary
with
changes
in
volume,
but
the
language
of
the
act
contains
no
such
limitation.
section
3622(b)(3),
and
i
read
the
requisite
provision,
that
"each
class
of
mail
or
type
of
mail
service
bear
the
direct
and
indirect
postal
costs
attributable
to
that
class
or
type.
"
and
that
is
all
it
says.
congress
did
not
use
technical
language.
it
employed
as
the
key
word
"attributable",
which
the
dictionary
says
is
caused
or
brought
about
by,
and
it
couldn't
have
used
the
more
all-inclusive
word,
i
submit.
as
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
stated
so
well,
the
commission
cannot
stop
with
statistical
variability
in
looking
for
causal
connections
between
costs
and
classes
of
mail.
it
must
go
on,
as
does
all
business,
to
other
inferences
of
causation,
deductive
analysis,
logic,
common
sense.
section
3622(b)(3),
the
costing
section,
also
couples
the
attributable
cost
requirement
with
a
requirement
that
each
class
of
mail
must
also
bear
that
portion,
and
i
am
quoting,
"of
all
other
costs
reasonably
assignable
to
such
class.
"
the
fact
that
the
reasonably
assignable
section
is
in
the
costing
subsection
makes
it
clear
that
some
unattributed
costs
must
be
reasonably
assigned
on
specific
cost
of
service
principles.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
for
example,
they
have
a
contingency
grant,
one
which
provides
for
contingencies
that
might
arise
in
the
coming
year.
that
one
ought
to
be
reasonably
assigned
based
on
the
classes
which
cause
the
costs
that
lead
to
the
concern
of
the
contingency.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
there
are,
and
in
our
judgment,
for
example,
they
will
amount
to
about
$6
billion,
or
25
percent
of
all
costs
which
will
be
apportionable
to
the
other
eight
factors
in
3622.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
causal
costs
that
don't--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--well,
you
might
have
a
building
which
is
up
for
30
years
without
change,
is
a
good
example.
the--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--well,
the
transportation
cost
is
really
an
abomination
as
it
is
presently
being...
if
it
is
hired,
if
they
hire
the
equipment,
then
they
attribute.
if
it
is
their
own
equipment
going
from
place
to
place,
then
they
do
not.
they
say
there
that
the
vehicle
must
go
regardless
of
the
volume,
and
they
will
attribute
for
the
sorting
and
then
stop,
and
say,
well,
the
rest
of
it,
the
truck
is
going
anyway,
and
therefore
we
don't
attribute.
but
that
is
a
very
big
question,
if
i
may
suggest,
and
i
have
13
minutes.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
united
parcel
service
does
run
its
business
quite
differently.
there
is
no
cost
that
is
not
attributed
to
what
causes
the
cost,
or
it
would
be
a
very
unsound
pricing
situation.
and
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
had
them
well
in
line.
it
is
this
new
case
which
is
causing
us
all
of
the
concern.
the
first
class
letter
monopoly,
soon
to
become,
by
the
way,
the
nation's
largest
monopoly
after
at&t,
will
provide
$13
billion
of
income
this
year,
57
percent
of
the
total
revenue
of
the
postal
service.
much
of
the
remaining
revenues
from
other
types
of
mail
where
they
compete
with
business
in
the
private
sector,
the
governors
of
the
postal
service
in
this
very
case
in
their
opinion
stated,
and
i
quote,
that
"the
postal
service's
goal
is
to
encourage
significant
increases
in
volume
in
an
increasingly
competitive
market
situation.
"
that
means,
take
just
this
case.
although
they
have
had
an
enormous
increase,
virtually
twice
the
cpi
since
1971,
they
ask
for
an
increase
of
33
and
one-third
percent
in
the
revenues
of
first
class
mail
and
8.3
percent
for
parcel
post,
which
competes
with
united
parcel
service
and
with
thousands
of
others
in
the
industry.
so,
i
need
not
tell
you
how
concerned
those
in
the
industry
are.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
we
are
worried
that
the
more
they
are
subsidized,
justice
rehnquist,
the
less
they
will
ask
for
money
for
parcel
post.
they
are
using
the
subsidization,
the
excess
of
the
money
that
they
get
for
first
class,
to
subsidize
these
classes
which
compete,
and
there
isn't
any
question
about
that.
but
i
might
say
to
your
honor,
that
we
are
not
the
only
ones
concerned.
instrumentalities
of
the
federal
government
are
deeply
concerned
that
the
postal
service
not
be
permitted
to
take
advantage
of
its
enormous
letter
monopoly
to
subsidize
services,
as
i
have
just
said,
which
compete.
thus,
within
the
past
year,
the
department
of
justice,
through
the
antitrust
division,
went
to
court
to
enjoin
the
postal
service
from
instituting
an
electronic
mail
service
known
as
ecom,
in
competition
with
private
enterprise.
the
antitrust
division
took
this
action
because
it
said,
and
i
quote,
"ecom
would
be
subsidized
and
would
pre-empt
private
sector
activity.
"
significantly
also,
just
two
months
ago,
the
committee
on
government
operations
of
the
house
of
representatives
published
a
unanimous
report
on
the
same
new
ecom
operation
of
the
postal
service
in
competition
with
private
industry,
a
new
service.
this
is
the
finding
of
the
house
committee
unanimous:
"that
the
current
ecom
rate
is
not
compensatory,
that
the
postal
service
has
known
for
some
time
now
that
this
is
so,
and
therefore
that
ecom
is
being
subsidized
by
other
postal
services
in
violation
of
section
3622(b)(3).
"
that
is
signed
by
william
baxter.
so
that,
your
honors,
we
are
in
a
situation
where
congress
took
very
specific
action.
it
had
experienced,
it
knew
the
pressures
over
all
the
years,
and
incidentally,
from
the
time
parcel
post
was
started
in
1913,
the
icc
had...
the
congress
didn't
even
give
itself
jurisdiction
over
that.
now
that
it
was
all
to
be
cost
oriented,
they
thought
it
was
all
right
to
permit
this
very
competitive
role
to
be
handled,
and
in
a
succession
of
opinions,
three
panels
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
have
gradually
brought
under
control
more
and
more
this
situation.
but
the
difficulty
is
that
you
have,
as
you
have
read,
the
desire,
as
i
have
just
read
to
you,
the
desire
of
the
governors
to
grow,
to
get
bigger,
and
to
compete
in
the
market,
and
they
are
competing
by
subsidization.
in
concluding,
so
i
will
have
time
for
rebuttal,
i
submit
that
anything
but
a
literal
application
of
section
3622(b)(3),
as
in
the
decisions
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
would
greatly
increase
the
opportunity
of
the
postal
service
to
subsidize
competitive
classes
of
mail
out
of
excess
revenues
of
monopoly
first
class
letter
mail.
certainly--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--yes.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
should
be
allocated?
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
we
would
believe
75
percent,
and
that
25
percent
ought
to
be
for
the
other
eight
factors
distributed
at
the
discretion
of
the
agency.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
certainly
we
would
have
the
result
which
i
have
deplored
if
the
second
circuit
decision
in
the
newsweek
case
were
to
be
affirmed,
and
i
respectfully
urge
that
it
be
reversed.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
may
it
please
the
court,
obviously,
i
cannot
in
four
minutes
answer,
and
you
will
have
to
rely
on
our
briefs.
so
many
statements
have
been
made,
the
very
last
one,
that
we
are
arguing
for
fully
distributed
costs.
your
honor,
my
friend
heard
me
say
in
response
to
a
question
by
justice
stevens,
that
we
believe
that
as
much
as
25
percent,
$6
billion,
is
allocable
under
the
other
factors
other
than
the
costing
factor
of
(b)(3).
it
has
been
asked
here
what
congress
intended.
congress
was
disgusted
with
the
politics
of
rate
fixing,
had
decided
to
get
rid
of
it,
and
had
decided
to
give
it
to
an
independent
agency,
but
it
was
wise
enough
to
know
that
it
had
to
set
up
all
kinds
of
safeguards,
and
it
did
it
in
the
simplest,
wisest
way
in
3622(b)(3).
it
did
it
by
the
requirement
of
attribution,
by
the
requirement
of
reasonable
assignment,
and
then
left
it
to
the
discretion.
now,
what
has
judge
meskel
done?
to
me,
what
he
has
done
is
remarkable.
he
has
said,
oh,
no,
short-term
is
enough,
and
that
is
50
percent,
but
this
doesn't
mean
that
they
can't
do
whatever
they
want.
they
can
go
up
to
100
percent.
well,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
that
was
not
what
congress
intended.
congress
intended
to
give
the
discretion
to
run
a
business
within
rules.
congress
intended
that
the...
not
simply
that
they
could
set
a
rule
that
long-term
variable
costs...
it
would
be
the
only
business
in
america
that
would
go
on
that
basis
only,
namely,
long-term
variable.
every
business
goes
on
the
other
items
which
i
have
mentioned
to
your
honor.
so,
there
is
no
doubt,
to
answer
the
questions
of
justice
o'connor
and
justice
blackmun
and
justice
stevens,
they
did
intend
to
give
discretion
to
the
commission.
they
gave
a
discretion
to
the
postal
service
unheard
of
in
the
past
in
american
life
to
under
certain
conditions
fix
its
own
rates,
different
from
the
commission,
which
indeed
it
has
done
on
the
20
cents,
when
the
commission
said
it
should
be
18
cents.
but
it
has
got
to
do
it
by
rules.
and
it
has
put
the
rules
into
effect
to
give
it
control,
and
now
judge
meskel
comes
along
and
says,
no,
we
only
have
to
give
them
50
percent.
well,
if
they
give
them
50
percent,
and
50
percent
of
all
costs
are
in
the
discretion
of
someone
whom
the
department
of
justice
has
gone
to
court,
and
i
won't
repeat
here
the
language
which
the
department
used
in
describing
the
conduct
of
the
head
of
the
postal
service
in
that
case,
and
the
department
of
commerce
has
come
out
in
despair,
and
now
a
committee
of
congress.
why?
because
they
are
not
adhering
to
the
requirements
of
the
act.
every
year
they
are
doing
better
under
the
decisions
of
the
district
of
columbia.
the
second
circuit
decision,
your
honors,
would
catapult
us
back
to
1971,
when
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
court
in
desperation
said,
here
are
rules,
but
you
are
not
following
any
of
them,
so
we
can't
reach
a
decision.
all
we
can
tell
you
is
what
to
do
next
time.
then,
in
the
second
decision,
they
told
them
what
to
do.
and
the
commission
did
it,
but
the
postal
service
wouldn't
do
it.
and
so
in
the
third
case,
the
court
got
stronger,
and
they
have
come
up
closer.
now,
today,
what
remains?
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that
court
has
said
we
will
never
fix
a
rate.
that
is
not
our
business.
but
it
is
our
business
to
see
that
the
statute
is
complied
with.
i
suggest
to
your
honor
if
you
read
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
opinions,
you
will
find
the
most
careful
reluctance,
the
most
careful--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--well,
i
must
say
to
your
honor
that
in
my
judgment,
and
there
is...
which
i
have
here...
there
is
a
specific
statement,
we
have
no
power
to
send
this
back
with
any
decision
as
to
any
rate,
and
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
to
get
the
postal
service
to
do
its
job,
to
exercise
its
discretion
within
the
rules,
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
is
not
following
the
rules,
and
if
judge
meskel's
opinion
can
prevail
whereby
only
50
percent
is
required,
but
you
can
go
to
100
percent
if
you
want,
120
percent,
that
kind
of
discretion
certainly--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--well,
mr.
garvey
says
that
it
doesn't
apply,
the
short-term.
let
me
read
you
what
judge
meskel
said.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
you
can't
read
it
that
way.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
but
let's
assume
that.
very
good.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
but
i
have
got
a
sentence
to
the
contrary.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
all
right.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
mr.
garvey--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--mr.
garvey
hasn't
said
a
word--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--long-term
variable
isn't
enough,
your
honor.
long-term
variable
will
never
suit
the
entire
purpose.
it
requires
what
all
business
in
the
country
does.
it
requires
the
exercise
of
judgment.
you
can't
say
that
you
are
going
to
operate
a
multi-billion
dollar
business
solely
on
statistics.
you
have
to
apply
judgment.
you
have
to
apply
discretion.
you
have
to
apply
the
rules
which
govern
business.
they
have
not
done
that.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
justice
white,
there
is
a
footnote
to
the
brief,
very
remarkable,
i
think,
of
the
solicitor
general,
which
says
that
the
commission
now
agrees
with
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit.
do
you
know
why?
because
it
gives
the
commission
a
discretion
that
congress
has
denied
it
for
eleven
years.
because
it
says
to
the
commission,
only
50
percent
is
required,
but
this
doesn't
mean
that
i
am
barring
you
from
doing
whatever
you
want.
