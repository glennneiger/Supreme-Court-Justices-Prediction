mr.
john
h.
garvey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
let
me
begin
by
allaying
justice
white's
concern
about
the
government's
concession
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact
before
the
postal
rate
commission
in
this
case,
the
postal
service
attributed
approximately
13
percent
of
the
services...
of
the
costs
of
the
postal
service
as
long-run
variable
costs,
and
took
the
position
before
the
rate
commission,
as
it
has
in
each
of
the
prior
two
general
rate
proceedings,
that
long-run
variable
costs
are
attributable.
in
the
second
circuit,
what
the
government's...
what
the
postal
service's
brief
said
in
making
the
point
that
indirect
costs
are
attributable
by
cost
variation,
they
quoted
the
house
conferees'
report
and
said
congress
did
make
quite
plain
that
short-term
cost
variability,
quoting
from
the
conferee's
report,
"was
the
method
prescribed
for
identifying
direct
and
indirect
attributable
costs.
"
the
court
of
appeals,
contrary
to
the
suggestion
of
ups,
did
not
hold
that
only
short-term
variable
costs
are
attributable.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the...
at
page
24
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
it
said
this:
"the
commission",
speaking
of
the
kaple
commission,
on
which
the
bill
was...
on
whose
labors
the
bill
was
in
large
part
based,
"the
commission
suggested
that
discrimination
in
rates
would
not
occur
as
long
as
each
class
covered
as
a
minimum
the
long-run
variable
costs
ascribable
to
it,
the
full
added
cost
demonstrably
related
to
that
class.
"
and
then
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
"this
suggestion
was
embodied
in
the
administration's
bill,
h.r.
11750,
and
the
subsequent
house
bill.
"
which
the
court
then
goes
on
to
say
is
the
language
adopted
by
the
conference.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
believe
it
is.
there
are
two
references
in
the
second
circuit's
opinion
to
short-run
variability.
the
references
are
a
quotation
of
the
house
conferees'
report
which
did
in
fact
use
the
term
"costs
which
vary
over
the
short
term.
"
in
response
to
line...
on
page
25.
on
page
27,
they
say,
again,
that,
"as
to
the
level
of
attribution
required,
we
conclude
that
the
definition
of
that
term
in
the
conference
committee
report
is
controlling.
"
speaking
of
the
definition
which
addressed
variability
with
volume
and
which
addressed
attribution
of
specific
fixed
costs.
i
think
that
it
is
only
the
most
tortured
reading
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
can
limit
it
to
short-run
variable
costs.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
the
postal
reorganization
act
was
designed
to
eliminate
or
to
preclude
in
the
future
if
it
had
not
happened
in
the
past
that
sort
of
discrimination
against
not
only
third...
not
only
first
class
mail,
but
other
classes
of
mail
as
well.
3622(b)(3),
the
provision
in
the
statute
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
says
that
each
class
of
mail
shall
bear...
as
a
minimum,
sets
a
rate
floor
which
each
class
must
pay,
what
it
calls
the
long-run...
what
the
kaple
commission
called
the
long-run
variable
costs,
what
the
house
bill
called
demonstrably
related
costs,
what
the
senate
report
called
incremental
costs,
and
the
reason
for
requiring
each
class
of
mail
to
pay
those
kinds
of
costs
was
that
that's
necessary
to
avoid
what
is
a
subsidy
in
the
true
economic
sense.
in
the
real
economic
sense,
a
subsidy
exists
when
class
a
would
actually
be
better
if
class
b
did
not
exist.
so,
for
example,
if,
the
example
the
kaple
commission
gave
was,
if
you
have
a
machine
that
is
just
used
for
sorting
parcels,
and
first
class
mail
were
required
to
pick
up
some
of
the
cost
of
purchasing
that
machine,
then
first
class
mail
would
actually
be
worse
off
if
fourth
class
mail
were
served
then
if
it
were
not.
with
respect
to
the
kinds
of
mail
that
you
are
concerned
about,
bulk
mail
in
third
class
is
introduced
into
the
postal
system
already
presorted
by
zip
code.
it
doesn't
need
to
be
cancelled
because
it
hasn't
got
a
stamp
on
it.
it
is
already
in
sacks,
and
it
is
brought
to
the
post
office
in
that
fashion.
first
class
mail,
the
kind
that
is
sent
from
one
household
to
another,
the
kind
that
the
greeting
card
publishers
are
concerned
with
in
this
case,
is
collected
by
the
post
office
from
collection
boxes.
it
is
then
brought
to
the
post
office
facility,
where
it
is
cancelled,
and
then
sorted
according
to
zip
code,
and
then
it
is
sent
to
a
destination
where
it
is
again
sorted
according
to
the
last
two
digits
of
the
zip
code.
all
of
those
kinds
of
expenses
are
eliminated
by
presortation
and
the
lack
of
need
for
cancellation
and
presacking
of
third
class
mail,
so
that
it
is
really
comparing
apples
and
oranges
to
say
that
third
class
mail
may
cost
ten
cents
and
first
class
mail
may
cost
20
cents.
for
one
thing,
the
statute
requires
that
third
class
mail
bear
all
the
costs
that
are
attributable
to
that
class.
for
another
thing,
the
act
permits
the
postal
service
to
apportion
the
institutional
costs
above
that
minimum
in
accordance
with
the
statutory
factors
set
out
by
the
act.
justice
o'connor
and
justice
rehnquist
have
suggested
that
it
looks
to
them
from
reading
the
act
as
though
the
postal
rate
commission
was
probably
left
with
considerable
discretion
in
apportioning
the
costs
of
the
postal
service
which
were
institutional
costs
above
these
long-run
variable
costs.
in
fact,
what
the
act
says
in
section
3522(b)
is
that
in
setting
rates,
the
postal
rate
commission
is
to
implement
a
number
of
policies
which
congress
gave
to
the
commission
as
specific
directives
in
setting
costs
of
mail.
the
statute
says
that
the
postal
rate
commission
shall
make
the
rates
fair
and
equitable,
that
it
shall
consider
the
value
of
service
rendered
to
each
class
of
mail,
that
each
class
shall
bear
its
attributable
cost,
that
the
rate
commission
shall
consider
the
effect
on
the
general
public,
on
business
mail
users,
on--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--yes.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
yes,
that's
correct.
in
addition
to
the
five
factors
i
have
mentioned,
3622(b)
goes
on
to
say
that
the
commission
shall
consider
the
scientific,
cultural,
informational,
educational
value
of
the
mail.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no,
we
do
not.
3622(b)
begins
with...
(b)(3)
begins
with
the
statement--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--that
it
is
a
requirement
that--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--yes,
it
does.
and--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--well,
no,
what
i
said
was
that
in
this
general
rate
proceeding
before
the
postal
rate
commission
of
the
costs
which
were
attributed
in
the
postal
service's
proposal,
13
percent
were
what
are
called
long-run
variable
costs.
i
said
that
in
order
to
indicate
that
the
postal
service
has
not
taken
the
position
in
this
proceeding,
nor
in
the
prior
proceeding,
nor
in
the
proceeding
before
that,
that
it
is
only
short-term
variable
costs
that
are--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--what
the
postal
service...
the
amount
of
attribution
that
the
postal
service
proposed
before
the
commission
in
this
proceeding
was
59.3
percent
of
the
total
costs
of
the
postal
service.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
suspect,
although
i
am
always
nervous
about
doing
subtraction
with
those
rates.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
think
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
report
of
the
kaple
commission,
from
the
house
conferees'
statement,
and
from
the
indications
in
the
senate
report
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
attributing
by
way
of
costs
were,
first
of
all,
those
costs
that
are
specific
to
a
particular
class
of
mail.
the
example
that
the
kaple
commission
gave,
again,
was
a
machine
that
you
only
use
for
sorting
parcels,
even
though
the
cost
of
that
might
be
a
capital
cost.
the
kaple
commission
said
that
it
ought
to
be
attributed
to
fourth
class
mail
because
it
was
used
for
that
sort
of
mail.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
strictly
speaking,
i
think
it
would
be
a
variable
cost
over
the
long
run.
those
kinds
of
machines,
i
think,
might
last
about
15
years,
and
your
volume
predictions
over
15
years
might
require
you
to
acquire
more
of
those
machines,
so
that
in
a
sense
they
are,
although
the
kaple
commission,
having
a
more
limited
horizon
of
what
long-run
variable
costs
were...
they
suggested
five
years,
i
believe...
said
that
in
that
time
frame
that
something
like
a
parcel
sorter
would
be
a
specific
fixed
rather
than
variable
cost.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no,
that
sort
of
equipment,
again,
it
depends
on
the
length
of
the
time
period
that
you
are
going
to
look
at
in
defining
variations,
but
that
sort
of--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--i
hope
not,
because
we
also
believe,
as
the
kaple
commission
stated
and
as
the
house
conferees'
report
said,
that
the
kinds
of
costs
which
the
postal
service
is
required
to
attribute
are
costs
which...
let
me
quote
to
you
from
the
house
conferees'
report.
after
the
conference
was
over,
what
the
house
conferees
had
to
say
about
3622(b)(3)
was
this.
"provision
in
the
conference
substitute
with
respect
to
costs
attributable
to
a
class
of
mail
or
type
of
mail
service
establishes
a
floor
for
each
class
of
mail
equal
to
costs
which
consist
of
those
costs,
both
direct
and
indirect,
that
vary
over
the
short
term
in
response
to
changes
in
volume
of
a
particular
class
or,
even
though
fixed
rather
than
variable,
are
the
consequence
of
providing
the
specific
service
involved.
"
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
they
were
wrong
in
speaking
of
short-term.
that
provision
was
drafted
for
the
conference
by
assistant
postmaster
general
hargrove,
by
the
general
counsel
for
the
post
office
department
and
by
the
general
counsel
for
the...
by
the
counsel
for
the
senate,
the
senate
which
had
said
that
only
incremental
costs
are
attributable.
and
assistant
postmaster
general
hargrove
testified
in
hearings
before
the
subcommittee,
the
rate
subcommittee
in
the
house
that
the
phrase
"demonstrably
related
costs",
the
phrase
used
in
the
house
bill,
had
precisely
the
same
meaning
that
was
given
to
attributable
costs
in
the
house
conferees'
report.
in
his
testimony
before
the
subcommittee,
assistant
postmaster
general
hargrove
said
that
in
the
revenue
and
cost
analysis
about
which
he
was
testifying,
what
the
postal
service
was
doing
was
attributing
costs
over
the
shorter
run,
and
then
went
on
to
say
that
postal
ratemaking,
being
a
continuous
process,
can
take
the
longer-run
variations
into
account
as
it
goes
along.
that
suggests
that
the
meaning
of
short
as
he
used
it
and
perhaps
as
the
house
conferees
used
it
meant
the
amount
of
time
between
one
rate
proceeding
and
the
next.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
the
question
in
this
case
is
really
how
far
the
postal
service
and
the
commission
are
required
to
go
in
discovering
what
kinds
of
costs
are
caused
by
particular
classes
of
mail,
and
the
postal
service
does
not
take
the
position
that
it
has
to
be
proven
by
empirical
studies
to
vary
with
volume
to
a
specific
percentage.
but
what
the
postal
service
and
the
commission
do
have
in
mind
is
that
volume
variation,
and
when
i
say
volume
variation,
i
mean
variation
with
the
number
of
pieces,
or
with
the
weight,
or
with
the
cubic
dimensions
of
the
mail,
is
the
way
to
identify
the
causes
of
common
costs.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
lot
of
different
classes
being
sorted
at
the
mail
facility,
and
according
to
zip
code,
and
stamped,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
if
you
have
100
letters
to
sort
according
to
zip
code
and
to
stamp,
it
is
going
to
take
approximately
twice
as
long
as
it
would
take
to
sort
and
cancel
50
letters.
those
kinds
of
costs
amounted
to
about
five
billion
costs
in
this
general
rate
proceeding,
and
the
postal
service
attributed
100
percent
of
those
costs
to
the
various
classes
of
mail.
what
the
petitioners
are
contending
in
this
case
is
that
what
they
call
cost
of
service
principles
ought
to
be
used
to
distribute
various
joint
costs
among
the
various
classes
of
mail.
for
example,
when
the
postman
goes
around
his
route
with
a
bag
full
of
mail,
if
he
has
100
letters
in
his
bag,
it
is
not
going
to
take
him
any
longer
to
go
around
the
route
than
it
would
if
he
had
50
letters
in
the
bag.
it
may
take
him
more
time
if
he
has
got
to
make
more
stops,
but
those
costs
are
attributive.
just
the
cost
of
going
around
the
route
itself,
though,
is
one
the
postal
service
treats
as
a
fixed
cost.
or,
the
cost
of
collecting
mail
from
collection
boxes.
it
takes
approximately
the
same
amount
of
time
to
collect
100--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--yes.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
absolutely.
that's
what
this
court
has
said
in
colorado
interstate
against
fpc,
that
this
kind
of
ratemaking
is
not
a
matter
for
the
slide
rule.
it
is
a
question
of
judgment
on
which
the
courts
ought
to
defer
to
the
agencies.
congress
in
fact
set
up
the
postal
rate
commission
as
an
expert
agency
in
order
to
resolve
those
kinds
of
questions
about
what
causes
or
what
costs
were
really
caused
by
a
particular
class
of
mail,
and
what
costs
ought
to
be
treated
as
institutional
and
apportioned
among
the
various
classes
of
mail
in
order
to
implement
the
policies
of
the
act.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
think
it
is
difficult
to...
i
can
give
you
examples,
and
i
can
give
you
the
general
definition
of
what
they
treat
as
properly
attributable.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
yes.
absolutely.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
what
the
postal
service
contends
are
the
costs
that
are
attributable
under
the
first
part
of
subsection
(b)(3),
as
i
mentioned
before,
are
the
costs
that
vary
with
the
volume,
number
of
pieces,
weight,
cubic
dimensions
of
the
mail,
or
costs
that
are
specific
to
a
particular
class
of
mail,
like
the
parcel
sorter
in
the
example
that
i
gave.
examples
of
the
first
kinds
of
costs
that
vary
with
the
volume
of
mail
are
the
kinds
of
processing
costs
that
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
costs
of
sorting
letters
according
to
zip
code,
the
costs
of
cancelling
letters,
many
of
the
costs
of
delivering
mail.
i
said
before
that
the
cost
of
the
postman
going
around
his
route
was
itself
a
fixed
cost,
but
the
cost
of
making
individual
stops
in
fact
varies
with
the
number
of
letters
to
a
degree
of
40
percent,
50
percent,
and
that
fraction
of
what
the
postal
service
calls
access
costs,
the
deviation
to
go
to
each
house,
are
attributed
to
the
various
classes
of
mail.
in
addition,
the
costs
of
transportation
of
mail
on
purchased
transportation
are
attributed.
when
the
postal
service
sends
first
class
mail--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--that's
correct,
although
it's
misleading
to
suppose
that
the
sort
of
use
of
the
postal
service's
own
vehicles
is
the
same
as
the
use
of
vehicles
for
purchased
transportation.
the
latter
kind
is
used
for
transportation
of
mail
between
cities.
the
postal
service,
by
contrast,
uses
vehicles
for
delivering
mail,
and
in
that
case
the
vehicles,
the
drivers'
time
and
the
vehicle
maintenance
is
treated
as
variable
to
the
same
extent
as
the
postman's
time
would
be
when
he
was
delivering
letters
on
his
route.
the
postal
service
also
uses
vehicles
within
cities
to
take
mail
from
the
main
post
office
to
the
branches
within
the
city.
there
may
be
about
100
of
those
in
the
city.
and--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--it
is
the
postal
service's
position
that
the
phrase
3622(b)(3)
does
not
mean
what
petitioner
ups
contends.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that
is
a
reference
to
the
remainder
of
the
provisions
in
3622(b).
it
is
an
indication
that
once
the
commission
distributes
the
attributable
cost
to
each
class
of
mail,
it
can't
stop
there,
that
it
ought
also
to
take
account
of
each
class
of
mail
in
apportioning
the
various
institutional
costs.
it
was
just...
that
provision
was
put
in
by
the
committee,
and
it--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--that's
right.
you
take
all
the
other
costs
of
the
postal
system,
and
then
you
assign
them
reasonably.
it
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense
to
say
that
a
requirement,
that
reasonable
assignment
is
itself
a
requirement
that
must
be
done
according
to
particular
characteristics.
otherwise,
it
is
a
little
strange
to--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--yes.
that...
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
that
method
of
apportioning
costs
is
irrational.
maybe
even
that
it
is
unfair.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
what
i
do...
it
is
not
the
consistent
practice
of
all
accountants.
the
d.c.
circuit--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--i
am
not
even
sure
that
it
is
good
accounting
practice,
because
it
tells
you
very
little
about
what
you
want
to
know
for
purposes
of
ratemaking.
let
me
give
an
example.
there
was
a
study
done
of
the
cost
ascertainment
system,
a
system
of
fully
distributed
costs
which
the
postal
service
used
from
1926
until
the
act
was
passed.
in
fact,
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
was
to
eliminate
this
system
of
fully
distributed
costs
which
the
cost
ascertainment
system
exemplified.
the
study
that
was
done
for
the
government
of
the
cost
ascertainment
system
was
done
by
ernst
and
ernst,
who
are
respected
accountants,
i
believe,
and
their
conclusion
was
that
the
distribution
of
costs
among
the
various
classes
of
mail
according
to
what
they
called
unsubstantiated
hypotheses
of
causation
is
singularly
unhelpful
for
ratemaking
purposes.
it
is
something
that
can
be
done.
as
i
said,
it
is
not
arbitrary.
in
a
way,
it
is
even
fair.
but
it
has
very
little
to
do
with
causation
of
the
costs
of
mail,
which
is
what
petitioners
say
is
the
reason
for
attributing
these
costs.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
factors
1,
2,
and
4
through
9.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
believe
it
would
not
be,
and
i
don't
understand
the
second
circuit's
opinion
to
forbid
that
sort
of
technique
in
future
rate
proceedings.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
the
factors
for
which
petitioners
are
plumping
in
this
case?
mr.
john
h.
garvey
absolutely
not.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
what
congress
intended
in
including
those
other
factors
in
the
act
was
to
have
the
postal
rate
commission
implement
the
policies
which
underlay
those
factors
in
its
apportionment
of
institutional
costs.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
absolutely,
although--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--i
am
not
concerned
about
falling
back
in
this
case,
because
i
believe
that
anyone
who
reads
the
report
of
the
senate,
the
report
of
the
house
conferees,
and
the
kaple
commission
report,
will
find
that
it
is
perfectly
clear
what
congress
intended
to
do,
that
congress
did
not
mean
to
limit...
to
distribute
costs
according
to
the
three
tiers
for
which
ups
contends
in
this
case,
that
congress
in
fact
explicitly
rejected
the
system
of
fully
distributed
costs
for
which
petitioners
are
contending,
that
congress
meant
to
require
only
as
a
minimum
that
incremental
or
long-run
variable
costs
be
attributed
to
each
class
of
mail.
petitioners
contend
in
this
case
that
what
happened--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--the
reason
i
keep
slipping
with
respect
to
that
sort
of
example
is
that
at
least
in
this
rate
proceeding,
and
in
the
ones
which
have
preceded
it,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
kinds
of
costs
which
are
specific
to
only
one
class
of
mail
have
been
relatively
minor.
in
fact,
even
the
example
of
the
parcel
sorter
which
the
kaple
commission
gave
is
a
little
bit
misleading,
because
the
parcel
sorter,
although
there
is
such
a
thing,
is
also
used
to
sort
third
class
parcels.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
it
is
a
slip
of
the
tongue
when
i
do
that,
because--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--the
government's
view--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--fixed
costs,
if
they
are
specific
to
a
particular
class
of
mail.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
yes.
what
the
petitioners
contend
in
this
case
is
that
it
was
really
the
view
of
the
senate
which
required
the
full
allocation
of
costs,
which
was
incorporated
in
the
act.
what
the
senate
report
says
is
this.
petitioner
ups
testified
in
hearings
before
the
senate,
and
they
pushed
for
a
system
of
fully
distributed
costs
like
that
which
governed
parcel
post
before
the
act
was
passed.
the
senate
report
had
this
to
say
in
response
to
that
contention.
"express
companies
in
the
private
sector
of
the
economy
have
expressed
their
very
keen
desire
to
include
language
in
the
bill
which
would
require
the
recovery
of
fully
allocated
costs
for
parcel
post.
"
"the
committee
rejects
the
suggestion
on
the
principle
that
no
particular
cost
accounting
system
is
recommended,
and
no
particular
classification
of
mail
is
required
to
recover
a
designated
portion
of
its
costs
beyond
its
incremental
costs.
"
"that
decision
is
for
the
postal
rate
commission
to
determine
in
accordance
with
the
general
criteria
enacted
by
law.
"
on
the
committee
which
signed
that
report
were
senator
mcgee,
senator
fong,
senator
randolph,
senator
yarborough,
and
senator
bayh.
those
five
gentlemen
who
signed
that
report
were
the
senate
conferees
in
the
conference
with
the
house.
if
what
petitioners
contend
is
correct,
they
would
have
us
believe
that
those
five
conferees
who
signed
that
report
saying
that
only
incremental
costs
should
be
attributed,
that
full
allocation
of
costs
was
specifically
rejected,
changed
their
position
and
somehow
succeeded
in
persuading
the
house
as
well
to
change
its
position,
and
to
require
full
allocation
of
costs,
or
75
percent
allocation
of
costs
under
subsection
(b)(3)
as
they
contend
here,
or
80
to
90
percent
of
allocation
of
costs,
as
the
greeting
card
publishers
contended
before
the
postal
rate
commission
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
it
is
difficult
to
say
what
the
proper
percentage
is,
because
it
depends
on
studies
which
the
postal
service
is
continually
making
to
identify
costs.
the
percentage
which
the
postal
service
identified
in
this
case
was
59.3
percent
of
the
total
revenue
requirement.
the
postal
rate
commission
itself
in
this
case
attributed
64
percent
of
the
total
cost,
and
then,
according
to
the
principles
of
service-related
cost,
assigned
another
approximately
9
or
10
percent
of
the
costs
of
the
postal
system.
so
that
what
was
actually
done
by
the
commission
was
an
attribution
and
assignment
of
74
percent
of
the
costs.
let
me
just
summarize
briefly.
what
the
postal
reorganization
act
requires
is
that
the
postal
service
and
the
postal
rate
commission
in
setting
rates
for
the
various
classes
of
mail
engage
in
essentially
a
two-step
process.
the
first
of
those
steps
is
the
requirement
that
each
class
of
mail
bear
the
direct
and
indirect
costs
attributable
to
that
class
of
mail,
which
include
both
specific
fixed
costs
and
costs
that
vary
with
volume
over
the
long
run.
after
that
sort
of
attribution
is
done,
3622(b)(3)
goes
on
to
say
that
the
postal
service
should
assign
all
of
the
other
costs
of
the
postal
service
in
some
reasonable
fashion,
and
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
structuring
that
sort
of
assignment
of
the
remaining
costs
were
the
policies
embodied
in
3622(b)(1),
(b)(2),
and
(b)(4)
through
(9),
the
last
of
which
is
any
other
factors
which
the
commission
considers
relevant.
thank
you.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
the
service
believes
that
the
allocation
of
service-related
costs
is
not
proper,
although
the
service
believes
that
it
is
not
forbidden
by
the
act.
the
reason
the
service
is
concerned
about
the
allocation
of
service-related
costs
is
that
for
one
thing
the
principles
of
causation
which
would
be
the
reason
for
tracing
those
kinds
of
costs
are
somewhat
diminished
by
the
fact
that
congress
has
now
said
that
even
if
there
aren't
preferential
classes
of
mail,
the
service
is
still
required
to
adhere
to
the
same
delivery
system,
and
what
is
more,
even
if
they
were
caused
by
the
preferential
classes
of
mail,
there
is
no
denying
that
other
classes
of
mail
are
delivered
six
days
a
week
along
with
the
preferential
classes,
so
that
they
would
be
getting
a
free
ride
if
those
costs
were
only
charged
to
first
and
second
class
mail.
on
the
other
hand,
the
postal
service
concedes,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
as
the
commission
believes
in
this
case,
that
there
are
similarities
between
service-related
costs
and
what
in
utility
ratemaking
generally
are
called
peak
load
costs
or
there
are
also
similarities
between
service-related
costs
and
the
kinds
of
specific
fixed
costs
with
which
you
have
been
concerned,
and
those
similarities
suggest
that
that
question
about
the
proper
distribution
of
service-related
costs
is
perhaps
one
which
ought
to
be
left
to
the
expert
judgment
of
the
postal
rate
commission
and
in
a
proper
case
the
postal
service.
