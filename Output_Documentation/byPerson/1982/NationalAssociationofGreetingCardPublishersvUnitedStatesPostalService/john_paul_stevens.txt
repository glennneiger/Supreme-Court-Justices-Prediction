--mr.
segal,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have...
can
you
give
me
an
idea
of
what
your
view
of
the
percentage
of
total
costs
that
should
be
allocated
under
a
proper
reading
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
if
you
just
take
short-run
variable
costs,
you
allocate
maybe
50
percent
of
that
total
cost.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
view
of
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
garvey,
do
you
disagree
with
what
i
thought
both
courts
accepted
as
a
premise,
that
the
cost
factor,
whatever
it
may
be,
has
to
be
given
priority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
disagree
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
then...
does
that
not
necessarily
mean
that
we
must
know
the
scope
of
(b)(3)
before
we
reach
the
other
factors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
your
view...
let
me
just
get
it...
as
to
what
is
the
scope?
you
said
13
percent
of
the
costs
are
long-run
variable
costs
under
the
second
circuit
holding,
as
i
understood
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
total...
what
is
the
percentage
of
total
costs
that
short-run
variable
costs
reflect?
does
the
record
tell
us?
as
a
general
matter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
included
the
13
percent
long-run.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
subtract
13
from
59,
and
you
get
the...
answered
my
question.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
else
is
there
in
the
variable
cost
factor
that
you
think
is
correctly
there
other
than
the
46
percent
and
the
13
percent
that
should
properly
be
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
think
the
term
"costs"
includes?
let
me
ask
you
that.
what
are
the
proper
statutory
components
of
the
concept?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
that
is
an
example
of
something
that
is
neither
a
short-run
nor
a
long-run
variable
cost.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
garvey,
unfortunately,
we
tend
to
jump
around
a
little
bit
in
an
argument
like
this.
it
would
be
helpful
to
me
if
you
could
tell
me
what
the
view
of
the
postal
service
is
with
respect
to,
a,
the
properly
included
direct
and
indirect
elements
of
cost,
and
secondly,
in
addition
to
those,
what
are
the
reasonably
assignable
costs
that
they
should
properly
take
into
account?
could
you
describe
them
in
any
general
fashion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
like
examples,
if
you
could,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
commission
does
have
a
duty
to
obey
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so,
of
course,
we
have
to
know
what
the
statute
means
and
know
what
components
the
commission
thinks
belong
in
the
various
categories.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
am
i
correct
that
the
cost
of
using
their
own
vehicles
is
not
attributed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
you,
if
i
may,
on
the
vehicle
cost
again.
it
is
the
view
of
the
postal
service
that
not
only
that
is
not
a
direct
or
an
indirect
cost
attributable
to
different
classes,
but
also
it
is
a
cost
which
is
not
reasonably
assignable
to
any
one
class.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
does
it
mean?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
reasonably
assignable,
you
mean
with
respect
to
all
other
costs
other
than
direct
and
indirect.
they
should
be
assigned
on
the
basis
of
judgmental
factors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
would
agree,
i
assume,
that
there
are
cost
accountants
who
could
assign
vehicle
costs
and
also
route
time
costs
other
than
on
a
strictly
volume
basis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
even
be
good
accounting
practice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
may
be
good
accounting
practice
for
many
accountants.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
to
clarify,
your
view
is
that
reasonably
assignable
means
reasonably
assignable
in
accordance
with
factors
4
through
9
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt?
you
said
only
incremental
or
long-run
variable,
but
one
of
your
examples
you
gave
me
was
the
sorting
machine,
which
is
neither.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
we
are
talking
about
concepts
now.
i
don't
know
the
dollars.
but
you
have
said
that
that
is
an
example
of
a
cost
item
that
the
statute
requires
to
be
assigned
on
the
basis
of
cost,
and
then
you
keep
saying,
though,
it
is
only
long-run
or
variable
costs
and
incremental
costs,
and
your
example
doesn't
fit
your
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
which
is
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
fixed
cost
required
to
be
allocated
in
the
example
you
gave?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
so
it
is
a
broader
category
than
the
way
you
have
defined
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
view
of
the
proper
percentage
that
should
be
allocated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
more
question
before
you
sit
down?
does
the
service
think
that
the
allocation
of
service-related
costs
was
proper?
