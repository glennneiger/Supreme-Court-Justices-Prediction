mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
segal
has
spoken
to
you
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
postal
service's
competitors.
i
speak
for
my
client's
customers,
who
are
individual
non-business
first
class
mailers.
when
the
postal
service
unilaterally
increased
its
rates
to
meet
its
revenue
requirements,
it
established
a
20--
mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
--well,
in
the
rate
commission
decision,
the
rate
commission
established
a
rate
of
18
cents,
and
other
rates
for
other
classes.
the
postal
service
put
this
into
effect
under
protest,
and
then
returned
the
matter
to
the
rate
commission
for
reconsideration.
the
rate
commission
did
not
change
its
position,
and
under
the
statute,
the
board
of
governors
may
unilaterally
increase
rates
if
revenues
are
not
sufficient.
mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
that
is
correct,
sir.
it
established
the
20-cent
rate
for
first
class,
a
rate
of
7.9
to
10.9
cents
for
third
class
advertising
circulars,
depending
on
the
degree
of
presortation,
and
a
rate
of
9
to
10
cents
for
time
and
newsweek,
depending
on
the
weight
of
the
particular
magazine
and
the
advertising
content.
discrepancies
such
as
this
result
from
full
attribution
of
those
costs
which
are
borne
most
heavily
by
first
class
mail,
such
as
collection
and
sorting,
and
treatment
of
other
costs
such
as
transportation,
which...
where
weight
and
cubage
or
cubic
volume
are
important
factors
as
institutional
costs.
the
problem
is
then
compounded
by
using
as
a
starting
place
for
applying
the
other
eight
statutory
factors
a
markup
which
is
calculated
as
a
percent
of
attributable
costs.
so,
for
first
class
mail
you
attribute
most
of
the
costs
they
incur.
you
don't
attribute
those
costs
that
tend
to
be
weight
or
cubage
related,
and
then
you
apply
a
markup
of
the
institutional
costs
as
a
percentage.
that
percentage
is
then
adjusted
by
the
other
statutory
factors.
mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
well,
i
believe
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
discretion
on
how
the
other
factors
are
applied.
what
i
am
reporting
is
the
way
the
rate
commission
is
in
fact
doing
it.
we
are
not
attacking
that
per
se.
mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
but
we
are
just
reporting
it
as
a
fact,
but
the
result
is
that
you
have
a
very,
very
high
percentage
of
costs
far
out
of
proportion
to
weight,
volume,
or
number
of
pieces
that
is
placed
on
first
class
mail.
mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
your
honor,
that
is
why
we
are
here
in
this
court.
that
is
what
we
are
complaining
about.
we
believe
that
that--
mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
--well,
we
believe,
as
mr.
segal
stated,
that
second,
third,
and
fourth
class
mail
are
undercharged,
and
that
the
difference
is
made
up
from
first
class.
we
are
here
urging
lower
first
class
rates,
and
we
are
not
attacking
revenue
requirements,
so
the
result
of
that
is
higher
rates
for
second,
third,
and
fourth
class
mail.
mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
that
is
correct.
my
clients
are
interested
in
low
first
class
rates.
mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
well,
they're
competitors
with
fourth
class.
mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
justice
o
connor,
the
two
really
merge.
the
rate
commission
has
taken
the
position
as
the
postal
service
has
that
a
cost
cannot
be
attirubte
if
it
does
not
vary
by
volume.
the
rate
commission
has
used
language,
particularly
in
its
early
decisions,
which
indicated
that
it
might
consider
other
methodologies,
but
it
never
has,
and
in
effect
if
you
cannot
prove
it
varies
with
volume,
it
is
simply
treated
as
an
institutional
cost.
mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
well,
i
think
they
have
articulated,
and
the
second
circuit
has
certainly
articulated
it
by
quoting
the
statement
of
congressman
udall
and
interpreting
the
statute
to
mean
only
costs
that
vary
with
volume.
we
think
that
is
incorrect,
but
we
are
urging
the
court
to
apply
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
require,
as
the
d.c.
circuit
did,
all
reasonable
inferences
of
cost
causation,
whether
the
cost
is
one
that
varies
with
volume
or
not.
we
believe
that
this
is
what
the
act
requires,
and
i
would
like
to
go
into
a
little
bit
why
we
think
the
act
requires
it.
it
is
very
simple.
direct
and
indirect
costs,
the
words
of
the
statute
cover
all
costs.
the
cost
is
either
direct
or
it
is
indirect.
as
mr.
segal
stated,
the
word
"attribute",
chosen
by
the
conference
committee
and
came
out
of
the
senate
bill,
has
no
technical
meaning.
the
postal
service
attempts
to
counter
this
by
legislative
history.
they
give
a
definition
of
a
phrase,
"costs
demonstrably
related",
which
was
used
by
the
kaple
commission,
which
recommended
establishing
the
postal
service,
and
was
used
again
in
the
house
bill.
now,
a
variety
of
definitions
were
given
to
that
phrase.
we
point
in
our
brief
to
the
various
definitions.
one
set
of
definitions
clearly
is
the
one
the
postal
service
is
relying
on,
but
other
definitions
were
used.
but
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
postal
service
is
correct,
that
that
meaning
of
the
house
words
and
the
house
bill
had
a
technical
meaning,
the
conference
committee
rejected
those
words.
they
did
not
take
the
words
of
art
and
put
them
into
the
bill.
they
took
words
from
the
senate
bill,
"attributable
and
assignable",
with
no
technical
meanings.
and
we
think
if
they
really
meant
volume
variable
cost,
it
would
have
been
very
easy
for
congress
to
say
that.
now,
respondents
take
the
position
that
the
house
was
tough
on
costing
and
the
senate
wasn't,
and
they
based
that
on
the
fact
that
there
was
no
explicit
rate
floor
in
the
senate
bill.
the
senate
bill
said,
you
will
consider
costs
with
a
list
of
factors,
but
didn't
state
explicitly
that
there
was
a
rate
floor.
now,
that
was
corrected
in
conference.
in
the
conference
committee,
the
word
"requirement"
was
added
and
the
concept
of
a
rate
floor
was
made
explicit.
we
think
it
was
implicit
in
the
senate
bill.
but
to
indicate
that
the
house
was
really
taking
the
lenient
attitude
on
cost,
we
have
to
look
at
another
section
of
the
bill.
section
1201(d)
of
the
house
bill
provided
that
if
the
various
statutory
factors
produced
too
much
hardship,
the
governors
could
ignore
them.
now,
that
was
dropped
in
the
senate
bill,
in
the
conference.
it
was
not
in
the
senate
bill.
it
was
dropped.
and
we
think
that
is
an
indication
by
congress
that
attribution
was
to
be
required
and
all
means
of
attribution
were
to
be
used.
the
legislative
history
in
the
senate
is
replete
with
concerns
that
first
class
was
used
as
a
cover-up
it
was
used
for
the
financial
shortcomings
of
the
postal
service.
that
is
the
phrase
of
chairman
mcgee.
and
the
senate
was
concerned
that
this
historical
practice
not
be
continued
when
it
wasn't
cost
justified.
now,
congressman
udall,
who
was
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
on
the
house
side,
was
a
supporter
of
cross-subsidization.
he
was
a
conferee.
and
after
the
conference,
and
after
the
senate
had
voted,
he
made
a
speech,
and
it
was
also...
similar
language
was
in
the
statement
of
the
house
managers,
which
attempted
to
define
what
"attributable"
meant,
and
it
said
that
the
house
view
was
accepted,
even
though
its
language
was
changed.
he
said
it
was
costs
that
varied
in
the
short
run.
the
postal
service
has
now
conceded
that
as
incorrect,
but
they
attempt
to
explain
it
away.
congressman
udall
did
not
explain
why
the
language
was
changed.
he
didn't
explain
why
1201(d)
and
its
escape
hatch
was
dropped.
we
suggest
that
congressman
udall
lost
in
the
conference,
and
was
simply
attempting
to
make
some...
plant
some
legislative
history
that
would
throw
doubt
on
what
the
conference
committee
did.
mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
well,
we
don't
think
so.
we
think
that
there
is
the
requirement
in
(d)(3)
which
must
be
met.
that
is
certainly
something
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
apportioning
the
other
25
percent,
roughly
$5
billion
of
costs
that
we
concede
are
institutional
costs.
there
has
been
no
suggestion
that
any
conceivable
rate
is
really
going
to
impair
the
value
of
mail.
all
classes
are
basically
inelastic,
and--
mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
--that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
matthew
s.
perlman
well,
we
think
that
is
a
significant
but
only
a
part
of
the
case.
the
d.c.
circuit
and
administrative
law
judge
winner
require...
were
talking
about
very...
substantially
greater
attribution
which
we
think
is
required.
