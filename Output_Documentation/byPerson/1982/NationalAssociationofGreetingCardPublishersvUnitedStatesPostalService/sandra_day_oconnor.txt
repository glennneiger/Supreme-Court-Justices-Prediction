mr.
segal,
are
there
other
causal
costs
that
don't
vary
either
directly
or
indirectly
with
the
amount
or
weight
or
volume
of
the
mail?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
generally
speaking,
what
do
those
consist
of,
the
causal
costs
that
don't
vary?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
with
the
volume
or
weight
or
number
of
pieces.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
transportation
costs,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mister
perlman,
i
was
a
little
confused
as
to
whether
you
were
concerned
with
the
degree
of
proof
required
presently
by
the
commission
or
with
the
underlying
concepts
employed.
there
was
some
confusion
as
i
went
through
the
briefs
in
my
mind
about
whether
the
complaints
you
were
making
was
really
one
of
prescision
of
proof
of
variablitiy
required
by
the
commission
or
one
that
went
further
into
the
principles
involved
in
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
perlman,
do
you
think
that
section
101(a),
which
provides
that
the
costs
of
establishing
and
maintaining
the
postal
service
shall
not
be
apportioned
to
impair
the
overall
value
of
such
service
to
the
people
is
an
indicator
of
some
sort
of
discretion
in
the
commission
over
and
above
the
expression
in
the
statute
which
you
have
addressed
in
your
petition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
kind
of
equipment
within
your
definition
of
volume
variable
cost?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
your
brief
took
the
position
that
the
subsection
we
are
talking
about
only
required
as
a
rate
floor
the
volume
variable
costs
attributable
to
a
class.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
they
were
wrong
in
saying
short-term.
they
didn't
mean
that?
