we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
81-1304,
on
the
consolidated
case,
national
association
of
greeting
card
publishers
against
the
united
states
postal
service.
mr.
segal,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
an
example,
mr.
segal,
of
one
in
that
category?

chief

mr.
perlman,
there
is...
at
least
i
understand
there
is
a
widespread
and
long-standing
popular
belief
that
junk
mail
has
been
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
all
the
other
mail,
if
you
know
what
i
mean
by
the
junk
mail.
now,
courts
don't
take
judicial
notice
of
popular
belief,
because
it
may
be
mythology.
do
you
have
any
comment
on
whether
there
is
an
accurate
allocation
of
the
cost
to
carry
the
so-called
junk
mail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
attack
seemed
to
be,
or
your
point
seemed
to
be
focused
more
on
first
class.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
garvey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say,
mr.
garvey,
about
that
general
proposition,
whether
myth
or
reality,
that
upper
class
mails
have
been
carrying
the
junk
mail
to
people's
doors
at
the
expense
of
the
upper
class
mails?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
segal?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
