does
your
client
for
first
class
mail
have
a
first

mail
rate.
justice

white
mister
segan's
are
competitors
with
second
third
and
fourth
class,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
want
high
parcel
post
rates.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you,
mr.
perlman,
a
question?
i
take
it
that
the
government's
concession
on
long-range
variable
cost
doesn't
satisfy
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
my
question
really
is
whether
we
should
deal
with
this
case
at
all
in
the
light
of
the
government's
concession,
because
if
the
government...
the
case
would
come
out
differently
in
some
respects
in
the
second
circuit
if
they
had
decided
based
on
what
the
government's
position
now
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
your
position
in
your
brief
here
perfectly
consistent
with
what
the
second
circuit
held?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
you
say
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
in
assigning
those
costs
to
refer
to
those
particular
factors.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
that
there
is
another
way
of
assigning
costs,
but
it
is
not
unreasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
to
use
these
other
factors
to
assign.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no,
the
factors
which
you
say
the
postal
service
uses
in
assigning
costs.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
even
need
to
win
on
that.
you
don't
need
to,
i
don't
suppose,
say
that
the...
that
congress
required
reference
to
these
other
factors
in
assigning
costs.
even
if
they
didn't
require
it,
you
can
argue
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
use
those
factors.
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
at
least
that
is
a
fallback
position,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
segal,
you
seem
to
be...
you
and
the
government
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
for
the
second
circuit
considerably
differently.
let's
assume
that
the
opinion
is
to
be
read
as
mr.
garvey
suggests
it
should
be
read.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
let's
assume
that
we
read
it
the
way
he
reads
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
all
right.
just
assume
it.
apparently
it
can
be
read
that
way,
because
he
honestly
represents
that
that
is
what
it
means.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
assume
that
is
the
correct
reading
of
it.
then
what?
a
lot
of
the
things
you
say
then
are--
justice
byron
r.
white
--then
you
are
just
disagreeing
with
what
his--
justice
byron
r.
white
--then
you
would
just
be
disagreeing
with
what
the
long-term
variable
costs
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
read
the
second
circuit's
opinion
the
way
you
do,
then
what
we
have
is
that
one
of
the
litigants
before
them
now
in
effect
confesses
error.
namely,
the
postal
service.
