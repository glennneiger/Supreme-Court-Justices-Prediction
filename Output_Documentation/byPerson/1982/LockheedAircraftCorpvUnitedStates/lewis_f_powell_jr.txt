justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
third
case,
81-1181,
lockheed
aircraft
against
united
states
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
a
civilian
employee
of
the
united
states
was
killed
in
the
crash
of
an
airforce
plane
that
had
been
manufactured
by
petitioner,
lockheed
aircraft
corporation.
the
government
paid
benefits
to
the
survivors
under
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act.
the
state
also
recovered
damages
from
lockheed.
lockheed
then
sought
indemnity
from
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
lockheed,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
held
that
the
exclusive-liability
provision
of
the
compensation
act
bars
all
such
third-party
actions.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
not
following
weyerhaeuser
against
united
states,
a
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1963.
accordingly,
we
hold
that
the
compensation
act
does
not
bar
lockheed's
claim
to
seek
indemnity.
the
merits
of
that
claim
are
not
before
us.
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
joined.
