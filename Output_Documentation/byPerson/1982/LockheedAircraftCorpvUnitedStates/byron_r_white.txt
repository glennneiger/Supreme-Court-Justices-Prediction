justice
byron
r.
white
but
wasn't
the
claim
in
weyerhaeuser,
didn't
it
arise
out
of
the...
out
of...
out
of
the
injury
or
death
of
a
crewman?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
what...
that's
what
the
court
said
could
be
claimed
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
did...
how
did
the
case
get
started
in
weyerhaeuser?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
lawsuit,
what
lawsuits,
what
lawsuit
was
brought?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
injured
person
get
a
judgment
against
the
third
party
other
than
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
the
third
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
the
third
party,
third
party--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
the
sense
somebody
other
than
the
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
the
third
party
bring
in
the
government
in
that
suit
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
there
was
a
claim
over;
please
pay
part
of
the
damages
that
we've
had
to
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
did...
did...
wasn't
there
a
claim
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
isn't
there
still
here
that
the
government
owes
lockheed
because
of
some
independent
duty
that...
that
the
government
owes
lockheed?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did...
the
claim
was
made
in
the
court
of
appeals,
though,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
said
there
wasn't
an
independent
duty.
justice
byron
r.
white
these
are
indemnity...
this
is
an
indemnity.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
do
you
think...
do
you
think
we
need
deal
at
all
with
the
independent
duty?
do
you
think
there's
any
claim
here
that
the
government's
liability
rests
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
