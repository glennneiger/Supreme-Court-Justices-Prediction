justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
gardner,
isn't
that
a
fairly
rational
drafting
of
a
sentence
that
starts
with
the
noun
"liability"
and
then
is
talking
about
the
liability...
what
liability,
the
liability
to,
and
then
starting
in
the
sixth
line,
to
the
employee,
his
legal
representative--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
as
you
read
the
statute
i
take
it
you
don't
find
any
of
that
surplussage.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
would
you
say
that
the
term
"any
other
person
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damages
from
the
united
states.
"
that
appears
in,
i
think,
the
seventh
and
eighth
lines,
would
you
say
that
covered
an
individual
or
corporation
like
lockheed
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gardner,
what
in
your
case
is
the
analog
to
the
public
vessels
act
in
weyerhaeuser...
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
corwin,
is
there
any
weight
of
authority
among
state
decisions
interpreting
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
as
to
whether
the
governmental
employer
would
be
liable
in
a
situation
like
this
or
whether
a
private
employer
would
be
liable
in
a
situation
like
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
i
asked
you
whether
there
was
authority
to
the
effect
that
the
government
would
be
liable,
and
you
said,
i
believe,
that
yes,
there
was
a
lot
of
authority
that
the
government
would
be
liable.
is
that
what
you
meant
to
say?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
were
the
1949
hearings,
not
the
original
enactment
of
the
lhwca.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
understand
the
petitioner's
claim
here
to
extend
to
a
case
where
there
is
is
simply
joint
tortfeasers,
both
the
government
and
somebody
else
both
harm
the
employee.
isn't
the
petitioner's
claim
predicated
at
least
in
part
on
some
differing
degree
of
responsibility?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
impression
then
is
that
the
petitioner's
claim
would
claim
the
same
sort
of
right
even
if
it
were
just
simply
two
joint
feasers,
neither
of
whom
would
be
entitled
to
contribution
from
the
other
at
common
law,
by
the
law
of
the
state?
