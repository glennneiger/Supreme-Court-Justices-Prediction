ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
section
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case
is
a
portion
of
a
major
workers'
compensation
program.
it
was
enacted
by
congress
in
1916,
and
it
covers
virtually
all
federal
civilian
employees.
under
the
program,
an
employee
who
is
injured
on
the
job
receives
compensation,
and
that
compensation
occurs
promptly,
it
occurs
without
regard
to
the
fault
of
either
the
employer
or
the
employee,
and
it
occurs
without
litigation.
it
is
an
administrative
scheme.
thus,
in
the
present
case
the
federal
employee,
ann
nash
bottorff,
was
aboard
the
c-5a
when
it
crashed
and
who
died
in
that
crash,
had
survivors.
those
survivors
applied
for
death
benefits
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
it
was
concluded
that
ms.
bottorff
was
in
the
course
of
her
duties
at
the
time
of
the
crash,
and
the
survivors
received
death
benefits.
benefits
are
paid
out
of
the
employees'
compensation
fund
within
the
treasury
department.
benefits
paid
out
at
the
present
time
are
running
around
$1
billion
per
year.
payments
to
the
employees
under
the
federal
employees'
compensation
program
essentially
take
the
place
of
tort
damages
that
an
employee
might
otherwise
be
entitled
to
recover.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
that
is
correct.
there
were
civilians,
there
were
civilian
employees.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
the
government
has
entered
into
agreements
with
petitioner
under
which,
as
petitioner's
counsel
indicated,
there
will
be
payment
of
a
portion
of
the
settlement
liability.
the
payment
of
the
compensation
to
the
federal
employees
who
were
a
part
of
the
group
that
died
in
the
c-5a
crash,
as
i
said,
takes
the
place
of
tort
damages,
and
in
essence
what
that
creates
is
a
ceiling
for
the
federal
agency.
the
agency
can
look
to
a
ceiling
that
allows
it
to
avoid
the
uncertainty
of
potential
tort
damages.
in
addition,
the
agency
can
avoid
the
constant
litigation
that
would
arise
if
work-related
injuries
were
always
settled
in
the
courts
under
the
tort
system.
now,
this
creates
what
has
been
referred
to
as
a
limited
liability
feature:
a
limit
on
the
liability
of
the
employer,
in
this
case
the
federal
agency.
this
is
something
that
congress
was
particularly
concerned
about
in
1949.
the
legislative
history
does
show
that
congress
was
quite
concerned
about
complaints
from
federal
agencies.
the
agencies
had
found
that
they
were
facing
suits
by...
facing
suits
concerning
these
work-related
accidents.
they
saw
that
they
were
being
opened
to
potential
tort
liability.
they
saw
that
they
were
facing
litigation.
they
would
be
forced
to
expend
time
and
resources
on
this
litigation.
congress
did
mention
frequently
in
the
legislative
history...
and
we've
cited
some
of
the
portions
in
our
brief
on
page
36...
congress
expected
that
by
enacting
section
8116(c)
there
would
be
an
end
to
this
sort
of
litigation;
that
agencies
would
be
free
to
proceed
with
their
business,
that
they
would
not
be
tied
up
in
litigation,
and
that
there
would
be
savings
that
could
in
turn
by
applied
as
compensation
for
the
employees.
virtually
all
workers'
compensation
programs
include
this
sort
of
limited
liability
feature.
and
this
court
on
several
occasions
has
acknowledged
in
the
context
of
other
compensation
statutes
that
the
limited
liability
feature
creates
a
protective
mantle
for
the
employer,
the
federal
agency
in
this
case.
under
the
longshoremen's
statute
this
court
stated
in
cooper
stevedoring
that
there
was
a
protective
mantle
created
by
limited
liability
and
that
that
mantle
extended
to
third
party
claims
against
the
employer
which
had
arisen
out
of
the
claim
of
the
employee
against
the
third
party
based
on
the
work-related
injury.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
there
is
indeed
authority
to
that
effect,
and
i
believe
we've
cited
in
our
brief
some
of
the
summary
discussion
of
that
issue
by
professor
larson.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
no.
i
must
have
misunderstood
your
question.
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that.
the
indication
under
the
state
laws
governing
private
employers
is
that
the
employer
is
immune
from
this
sort
of
third
party
suit;
that
in
addition
to
the
liability,
limited
liability
vis-a-vis
the
employee
or
any
dependents
or
whatever,
in
addition,
any
sort
of
third
part
suit
of
the
sort
that
petitioner
is
urging
here
also
is
barred.
now,
petitioner's
counsel
raised
the
new
york
law
and
suggested
that
we
had
not
addressed
the
new
york
law.
i
believe
we've
indicated
at
least
at
one
point
in
our
brief
that
there
is
some
question
as
to
what
the
new
york
law
in
fact
was
at
the
time
of
passage
in
1949
of
this
section.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
both
the
house
and
senate
reports
on
this
legislation
do
not
refer
to
the
new
york
law;
rather,
the
language
that
congress
used
was
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
in
general
have
this
sort
of
provision,
referring
to
the
exclusive
liability
provision.
there
is
some
mention
of
new
york
laws...
petitioner
has
referred
to
it
in
its
brief...
but
that
mention
is
in
the
hearings,
and
it
is
in
the
context
of
mentioning
that
this
legislation
is
based
on
the
longshoremen's
statute,
the
new
york
statute
and
other
workers'
compensation
statutes.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
that's
correct.
this
is
in
1949
when
congress
was
looking
at
this
problem
that
the
federal
agencies
had
brought
up
to
it,
and
there
was
realization
that
in
fact
there
were
models
for
this
sort
of
provision
around,
that
states
had
it,
that
the
longshoremen's
statute
had
it,
and
in
fact
that
this
was
something
that
might
fit
the
bill
for
the
federal
agencies.
now,
i
suggest
that
new
york
was
one
among
many
and
that
if
there
was
any
model,
perhaps
it
was
the
longshoremen's
statute,
which
as
this
court
has
observed
is
very
close
to
the
language
here.
the
new
york
situation
in
1949
was
simply
not
that
clear.
petitioner's
counsel
has
referred
to
the
westchester
lighting
case
in
1938.
that
case
has
been
interpreted
by
the
second
circuit
on
several
occasions
as
referring
to
a
contractual
sort
of
claim,
not
a
tort
claim
of
the
type
that
petitioner
is
urging,
but
rather...
and
this
is
where
the
independent
duty
language
comes
in...
the
court
used
the
term
"independent
duty"
in
the
new
york
case,
but
the
second
circuit
has
interpreted
that
as
a
duty
arising
out
of
a
contractual
relationship
between
the
lighting
company
and
the
landowner
in
that
case.
so
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
anyone
was
contemplating
new
york
law
vis-a-vis
tort
indemnity
of
the
sort
the
petitioner
is
urging
here.
the
longshoremen's
statute
is
not
the
only
area
that
this
court
has
looked
at
with
respect
to
the
limited
liability
feature
of
a
compensation
scheme.
the
court
examined
the
military
compensation
scheme
in
stencel
aero
in
1977.
this
was
a
claim
that
was
very
similar
to
the
one
that's
put
forward
here.
it
involved
a
contractor.
it
involved
product
liability.
the
court
examined
several
features
of
that
case,
and
one
of
them
was
the
limited
liability
feature
of
the
military
compensation
statute.
the
court
again
referred,
as
it
had
in
the
longshoremen's
case,
to
the
protective
mantle
that
is
granted
to
an
employer
under
a
compensation
statute,
and
it
said
that
it's
an
essential
feature
of
a
compensation
scheme
such
as
the
military
compensation
scheme
that
was
before
it,
and
i
suggest
such
as
the
compensation
scheme
that
applies
to
federal
civilian
employees.
the
court
indicated
that
it
would
be
a
circumvention
of
that
limited
liability
feature
for
the
court
to
permit
the
third
party
claim
that
was
urged
so
strenuously
in
that
case.
that
sort
of
reasoning
applies
to
this
statute
as
well...
again,
the
limited
liability
feature
in
a
workers'
compensation
scheme.
in
essence--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--i
think
that
this
court
in
the
weyerhaeuser
case
was
looking
at
a
rather
different
situation
than
what
we
have
in
this
case.
the
claim
in
weyerhaeuser
was
not
a
tort,
a
purely
tort
claim.
it
was
not
even
under
the
tort
claims
act.
it's
not
the
sort
we
have
here.
instead,
it
was
an
admiralty
claim.
the
court
perceived...
the
court
described
it
in
terms
of
an
ancient
rule
that
seemed
to
have
governed
rights
and
duties
in
the
area
of
collisions
in
the
maritime
area.
the
court
also
looked
at
the
fact
that
it
had
decided
the
case
long
ago,
long
before
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
was
even
enacted
initially
in
1916.
the
court
in
the
preceding
century
had
decided
the
chatahoochee,
another
admiralty
case
involving
the
divided
damages
rule.
and
i
think
the
court
was
seeking
to
reconcile
what
it
had
before
it
in
weyerhaeuser
with
what
it
had
decided
in
the
past
and...
and
had
been
on
the
books
at
the
time
the
compensation
passed...
act
was
passed.
essentially,
i
think
what
the
court
saw
in
weyerhaeuser
was
something
it
viewed
as
analogous
to
the
contractual
indemnity
provision
that...
or
contractual...
implied
contractual
indemnity
in
ryan.
the
court
in
weyerhaeuser
did
turn
to
ryan
and
said
we
don't
find
a
contract
here,
but
we
find
something
that's
very
similar
to
the
contract,
and
therefore,
we
think
that
congress
probably
did
not
intend.
we
think
this
is
more
like
ryan
which
we've
already
said
is
not
barred
by
the
longshoremen's
equivalent
provision.
and
i
think
the
court
there
simply
was--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--i
think
that
the
court
did
make
some
statements
about
the
language
in
weyerhaeuser
that
do
appear
to
be
broad,
but
i
think
the
language
that
you're
referring
to
is
not
necessary
to
the
court's
decision
in
that
case,
and
i
think
in
fact
what
the
court
concluded
was
that
the
language
simply
was
not
enough
to
allow
it
to
answer
that
question
that
was
before
it
in
weyerhaeuser.
the
conclusion
of
the
court
was
that
the
language
simply
wasn't...
it
wasn't
plain,
and
it
had
looked
through
the
legislative
history,
and
it
didn't
find
a
mention
of
third
parties;
and,
therefore,
it
felt
it
ought
to
move
on
and
consider
these
other
features
i've
referred
to...
the
ancient
admiralty
rule,
the
analogy
to
ryan.
i
think
that
the
court
was
simply
not
faced
with
the
sort
of
tort
indemnity
claim
that
we
have
here
in
which
the
liability
alleged
is
basically
a...
the
liability
of
a
joint
tort
feaser.
it
is
not
based
on
some
sort
of
contract.
it
is
not
based
on
some
ancient
admiralty
rule.
rather,
it
is
purely
a
tort
claim.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
indeed,
the
element
of
damages
at
issue
in
weyerhaueser
was
in
fact
the
amount
that
had
been
paid
to
an
employee
who
had
previously
received
compensation.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
the
court
was
not
necessarily
talking
about
a
claim
over
in
that
case.
it
was
referring
to
a
rule
under
the
admiralty
system
in
which
the
damages,
all
sorts
of
damages,
were
really
put
into
one
pot
and
then
split
in
half.
this
was
a
way
that
apparently
admiralty
had
had
for
a
number
of
years
of
divying
things
up
when
two
ships
ran
into
each
other,
in
essence.
so
it
was
not
really
what
you'd
call
a
contribution
claim
or
an
indemnity
claim.
it
was
this
question
of
what
you
ought
to
do
with
all
the
damages,
and
the
decision
was
yes,
you
could
include
this.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
the
case
started
essentially
when
the
two
ships
ran
into
each
other.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
think
there
was
a...
my
knowledge
of
admiralty
is
limited,
but
i
believe
that
there
was
a...
probably
a
limited...
limitation
on
liability
proceeding,
and
there
was...
the
question
at
issue
before
the
court
was--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--i
believe
there
was
a
settlement.
i
believe
there
had
been
a
suit
by
the
employee
that
was
settled.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
that's
correct.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
that's
correct.
the
employee
had
sued
the
third
party
and
had
recovered
a
settlement,
not
a
judgment
but
a
settlement.
and
the
question
was
whether
that
$16,000
settlement
ought
to
go
into
the
pot.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
believe
that
the
third
party
then
in
the
separate
proceeding
involving
how
you
ought
to
apportion
the
damages,
including
the
property
damages
from
the
collision,
then
said
we
ought
to
put
in
this
other
element
of
damages
as
well.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
that--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--one
could
argue
that
it
is
the
same
sort
of
thing,
but
i
think
this
court
saw
it
in
a
somewhat
different
context,
in
the
context
of
a
proceeding
that
was
really
part
of
the
rules
and
rights
and
liabilities
of
the
individuals
who
were
out
there
sailing
around
the
ocean.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
am
not
aware
of
any
effort
to
try
to
overturn
that
sort
of
court-created
admiralty
rule.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
legislative
effort.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
it
quotes
the
same
language,
but
as
i
suggested,
i
think
the
conclusion
was
the
language
simply
wasn't
enough
to
answer
the
question
before
the
court
concerning
what
you
do
with
this
divided
damages
rule.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
there
are
several
answers
to
that
question.
first,
i
think
it's
strange
to
suggest
that
the
first
part
of
the
statute
in
fact
gives
the
government
exclusive
liability,
but
then
somehow
the
expansion
and
the
explanation
that
follow
take
it
away
again.
i'm
not
sure
that
that
makes
very
much
sense
in
terms
of
statutory
construction.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
petitioner's
counsel
suggests
that
the
first
part
in
fact
would
grant
exclusive
liability,
but
the
fact
that
it's
been
expanded
upon
in
the
latter
part
of
the
section
somehow
takes
it
away.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
a
proper
reading.
i
think
that
that
language,
much
of
it
was
added
in
1949,
and
there
was
no
explanation
of
why
there
was
an
enumeration,
but
the
language
was
very
similar
to
what
one
finds
in
the
longshoremen
statute
and
a
number
of
state
statutes.
not
only
new
york.
i
believe
places
like
georgia
and
minnesota
and
others
had
this
same
sort
of
enumeration.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
no,
i
think
not.
ryan
very
specifically
turned
on
the
implied
contractual
indemnity
that
the
court
found
in
that
case
and
that
the
government
urged
on
the
court
to
find;
that
really
the
focus
was
is
there
something
other
than
tort
liability
here;
can
we
look
to
the
relationship
between
the
parties
in
ryan
and
find
a
service
relationship,
a
contract
to
perform
a
duty
and
to
perform
it
well,
and
can
we
read
into
that
some
sort
of
obligation
to
indemnify.
the
court
concluded
in
that
case
that
yes,
it
could,
and
it
specifically
stated
that
it
did
not
address
the
problem
that
petitioner
presents;
that
of
this
noncontractual
indemnity,
the
purely
tort-based
indemnity.
i
think
that
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
looking
to
this
court's
decisions
have
been
rather
careful
to
distinguish
that
sort
of
contract,
whether
it
be
express
or
implied,
from
the
kind
of
pure
joint
tortfeaser
situation
that
we
have
here.
now,
i
don't
know
exactly
why
congress
chose
the
particular
enumerations
it
did.
it
may
well
have
been
that
the
thought
was
to
give
some
notice
to
individuals
that
would
be
affected
by
this
act
to
be
sure
everybody
understood
just
who
was
excluded.
but
i
think
that
the
addition
of
the
rather
very
broad
phrase
"all
other
persons"
or
"anyone",
as
it
was
at
that
time,
"anyone
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damages.
"
i
think
that
is
a
broad
phrase
that
one
simply
ought
not
to
confine
to
some
very
small
category.
i'm
not
sure
there
is
anything
else
to
put
into
that
category
other
than
third
parties.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
agree
there
are
many
different
ways.
i
think
the
general
tone
of
the
statute
is
a
very
broad
one.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
you
don't
find
any
expectation
on
the
part
of
congress
that
this
limited
liability
feature
is
going
to
be
somehow
breached
in
particular
cases.
you
don't
have
congress
giving
any
indication
that
its
expectations
about
the
savings
of
money
to
government,
and
particularly
the
savings
in
litigation
having
to
be
in
court
all
the
time
over
these
thousands
of
work-related
accidents,
you
don't
find
any
indication
that
congress
thought
sometimes
this
will
be
the
case
and
sometimes
not.
rather,
the
statements
were
we
believe
this
is
going
to
keep
the
agencies
out
of
the
courts.
so
i
think
you
have
to
read
the
statutory
language
in
light
of
that
expectation.
you
have
to
read
it
in
light
of
the
expectation
that
under
a
compensation
scheme
the
limited
liability
feature
is
going
to
be
an
effective
one;
that
it
ought
not
be
circumvented,
as
the
court
has
suggested,
by
the
third
party
claim.
if
it
were,
you
would
have
the
anomaly
under
which
the
mere
fortuity
of
the
involvement
of
a
third
party
in
an
accident
would
break
down
the
limited
liability
feature;
that
is,
if
you
had
the
government
as
the
only
party
and
individual
tortfeaser
that
was
one
hundred
percent
negligent,
under
congress'
statute
the
government...
the
government's
liability
is
confined
to
its
compensation
payment.
however,
if
somehow
you
have
a
third
party
that
comes
into
the
picture,
then
suddenly
that
breaks
down.
if
the
government
is
75
percent
negligent
and
someone
else
is
25
percent
negligent,
then
you
have
no
more
limited
liability.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i'm
not
sure
there's
any
way
to
limit
petitioner's
claim
in
that
manner.
the
sort
of
allegation
in
the
question
presented
is
framed
in
terms
of
active
negligence
and
secondary
liability.
i
think
it
was
justice
black
who
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
ryan
that
those
are
very
slippery
terms.
you
really
can't
quite
tell
what
they
mean.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
think
that's
correct.
i
don't
see
any
way
to
really
cut
off
this
principle
at
some
50
percent
level.
and
as
i
say,
i'm
not
sure
what
active
negligence
means,
but
if
it
means
more
than
50
percent
i'm
not
sure
why
this
principle
that
breaks
down
the
limited
liability
can
apply
on
a
51
percent
liability,
but
not
on
49
percent
liability.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
way
that
petitioner
has
framed
its
argument
in
this
case
that
really
limits
to
something
like
an
indemnity
claim
as
opposed
to
a
contribution
claim.
i
think
the
courts
have
recognized
that
this
sort
of
indemnity
claim,
not
based
on
a
contract
but
based
on
differing
degrees
of
negligence,
is
really
an
extreme
form
of
contribution.
there
is
really
not
that
much
to
differentiate
it
from
any
joint
feaser
claim.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
we
certainly
read
lockheed's
brief
to
suggest
that
they
thought
that
was
the
case,
and
we
pointed
that
out
in
our
reply
and
got
a
firm
denial.
i'm
not
sure
where
we
stand
on
independent
duty.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
certainly
the
claim
based
on
independent
duty
was
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
based
on
some
law
that
had
arisen
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
it
was
not...
the
concept
was
not
rejected,
but
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
the
claims
that
were
being
made
and
said
these
just
clearly
aren't
independent
duties.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
these
are
things
that
are...
and
it
specifically
referred
to
the
statutory
language,
although
it
picked
the
earlier
version
rather
than
the
later
version...
it
said
these
duties
are
on
account
of
or,
alternatively,
because
of
injuries
or
death.
there
are
simply
not
the
sorts
of
independent
duties
that
other
courts
have
been
talking
about,
and
those
are
things
like
the
ryan
implied
contractual
indemnity
and
perhaps
this
divided
damages
rule.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
think
that...
i
think
not.
i
think
petitioner
has
suggested
that
it
is
not
particularly
interested
in
pressing
that
point,
and
i
think
that
any
independent
duty
as
formulated
by
any
other
court
is
more
a
matter
of
contract
and
not
this
sort
of
pure
indemnity
claim.
i
believe
justice
o'connor
asked
petitioner's
counsel
about
this
independent
duty.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
and
i
didn't
hear
any
response
that
suggested
that
in
fact
they
had
prevailed
on
that
or
that
they
were
pressing
that
here.
so
i
don't
think
it's
something
that
the
court
needs
to
address.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
that
is
correct.
i
think
the
amount
has
been
determined
and
possibly
paid
out.
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
the
question
here
is
simply
should
the
government
be
asked
to
take
on
part
of
that
tort
settlement.
now,
petitioner
has
referred
to
itself
in
the
brief
as
a
stranger
to
the
compensation
system;
and
we
suggest
that
that's
not
really
the
case.
the
compensation
systems
have
been
around
for
a
long
time,
and
i
think
that
petitioner
is
well
aware
of
them
in
the
state
context;
in
fact,
probably
takes
advantage
of
this
limited
liability
in
the
states
where
it
is
an
employer.
petitioner
is
an
experienced
government
contractor
and
is
used
to
dealing
with
the
government;
in
fact,
could
have
anticipated
that
in
this
case
the
likeliest
thing
that
could
have
happened
would
be
the
c-5a
going
down
with
a
full
complement
of
troops,
military
personnel;
and
under
stencel
aero
this
court
has
said
that
there
would
be
simply
no
chance
of
a
third
party
claim
in
that
case.
so
i
think
that
petitioner
is
complaining
largely
about
the
fact
that
the
tort
system
allows
a
plaintiff
to
recover
against
single
tortfeaser
and
sometimes
another
is
not
available
to
help
share.
and
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
can
be
foreseen
and
planned
against,
particularly
by
someone
in
petitioner's
situation.
in
sum,
we
urge
that
this
court
protect
the
limited
liability
feature
that
we
think
congress
fully
intended
in
1949
to
make
clear
to
codify
and
incorporate
into
the
act.
petitioner's
interpretation,
we
urge,
is
one
that
would
break
down
that
limited
liability
feature
and
would
be
contrary
to
the
sort
of
scheme
that
congress
set
up.
we
urge
the
court
to
reject
that
interpretation
and
to
maintain
what
we
believe
to
be
the
intent
of
congress
ever
since
1949.
thank
you.
