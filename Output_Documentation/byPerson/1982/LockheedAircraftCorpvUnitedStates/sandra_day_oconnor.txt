mr.
gardner,
are
you
going
to
touch
on
the
independent
duty
and
derivative?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gardner,
may
i
ask,
even
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
your
interpretation
of
the
section
8116(c),
what
would
we
do
about
determining
whether
there
is
a
substantive
right
to
indemnity
under
the
d.c.
law?
would
the
court
have
to
remand?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
agree.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
overcome
the
weyerhaeuser
case,
however?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
language
used
certainly
is
broad
enough
to
have
some
implications
here,
wouldn't
you
agree?
