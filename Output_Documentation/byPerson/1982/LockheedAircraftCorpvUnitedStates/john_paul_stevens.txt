yes,
but
the...
those
rules
survived
the
enactment
of
this
statute.
this
statute
didn't
cut
off
the
liability
at
the
ceiling
of
the
compensation
program.
and
i'm
wondering
if
the
government
has
at
any
time
since
that
decision
asked
congress
to
straighten
it
out,
because
i
think
you
acknowledge
in
your
brief
that
you
think
that
decision
was
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
a
sense
it
was
an
admiralty
rule,
but
it
was
also
construction
of
this
very
provision
we
have
before
us.
they
quote
the
same...
justice
stewart
quotes
the
same
language
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
do
you
do
with
your
opponent's
argument
that
if
the
statute
meant
what
you
say
it
means,
why
don't
you
just
stop
after
the
word
"instrumentality"?
why
isn't
the
rest
of
the
statute
redundant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
doesn't
take
it
away.
it
just
describes
the
area
with
which...
in
which
the
viability
shall
be
exclusive
as
he
reads
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
to
the
extent
that
it's
the
same
as
the
longshoremen's
act
doesn't
the
ryan
case
cut
against
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
your
emphasis
on
that
language
just...
it
might
have
been
written
"any
liability
to
any
person
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damages
from
the
united
states.
"
but
it
doesn't...
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
you
could
have
written
your
interpretation
more
briefly,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
the
original
plaintiff
has
no
interest
whatsoever
in
the
outcome
of
this
dispute;
that
the
recovery,
the
settlement
recovery
is
precisely
the
same
whether
it's
paid
entirely
by
lockheed
or
shared
with
the
government?
