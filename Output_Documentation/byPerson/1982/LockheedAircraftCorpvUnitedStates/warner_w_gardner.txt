mr.
warner
w.
gardner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
crash
of
a
c-5a
aircraft
which
was
delivered
to
the
air
force
by
lockheed
in
september
of
1970.
in
march
of
1975
the
plane
was
stationed
at
the
travis
air
force
base
in
california.
on
march
the
16th
it
was
cannibalized
and
two
tie
rods
were
removed
for
the
benefit
of
another
plane.
eight
days
later
the
tie
rods...
other
tie
rods
were
replaced.
at
the
time
the
rigging
of
the
lock
which
held
the
aft
cargo
ramp
was
not
fully
rigged.
on
april
the
1st
the
plane
left
travis,
went
to
georgia
where
it
picked
up
50
tones
of
howitzers.
from
there
it
went
to
saigon
with
some
trans-pacific
way
stops
and
arrived
at
noon
on
april
the
5th,
1975.
that
was
one
or
two
days
before
the
final
fall
of
saigon.
within
a
space
of
three
hours
the
howitzers
were
unloaded
and
301
passengers
somehow
put
aboard
the
plane,
most
of
whom
were
vietnamese
orphans.
shortly
after
takeoff
the
locking
mechanism
on
the
door
to
the
aft
cargo
ramp
gave
way.
the
ramp
fell,
severing
the
control
lines
of
the
plane.
in
an
unsuccessful
effort
to
regain
the
saigon
airport
it
crashed
with
heavy
loss
of
life
and
injury
to
almost
all
of
those
who
survived.
several
hundred
product
liability
suits
were
filed
against
lockheed.
they
were
consolidated
by
the
multidistrict
panel
in
the
district
of
columbia
courts
here.
in
each
case
lockheed
joined
the
unites
states
as
third
party
defendant.
after
extensive
discovery,
the
united
states
and
lockheed
produced
an
agreed
statement
of
material
facts
and
further
agreed
between
themselves
upon
a
percentage
division
of
any
recovery.
that
last
agreement
reserved,
however,
the
rights
of
the
united
states
under
the
so-called
exclusive
liability
provisions
of
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
in
respect
of
civilian
government
employees.
there
were
about
33
suits
filed
involving
civilian
government
employees.
this
is
the
lead
case.
the
case
was
filed
by
mr.
thomas
as
administrator
of
the
estate
of
a
deceased
civilian
government
employee.
he
was
paid
an
award
under
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
and
brought
suit
against
lockheed
on
product
liability.
that
suit
has
been
settled
with
the
agreement
of
the
united
states.
there
remains
open
only
the
claim
of
the
united
states
to
immunity
or
absence
of
liability
because
of
the
provisions
of
section
8116(c)
of
title
v.
that
exclusive
liability
provision
is
printed
at
page
2
of
the
blue
brief.
the
government
insists
that
its
plain
words
provide
that
the
government
should
be
liable
to
no
one
in
respect
of
an
employee
covered
by
the
employees'
compensation
act.
we
would
be
inclined
to
agree
with
the
government
if
the
statute
stopped
at
the
fifth
line
as
we
have
printed
it.
it
would
then
read:
"the
liability
of
the
united
states
or
an
instrumentality
under
this
subchapter
with
respect
to
the
injury
or
death
of
an
employee
is
exclusive
and
instead
of
all
other
liability
of
the
united
states
or
the
instrumentality.
"
if
there
came
at
that
point
a
period,
as
i
have
indicated,
we
think
the
government
would
be
right.
instead,
the
statute
goes
on
for
another
eight
lines,
all
of
which
would
seem
to
be
surplussage
in
the
government
reading.
moreover,
those
eight
lines
themselves
contain
a
second,
inexplicable
redundancy
under
the
government's
reading.
if
suit
is
barred
by
all
persons,
why
ever
did
the
congress
enumerate
the
employee,
his
legal
representative,
spouse,
dependents,
next
of
kin?
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
yes,
sir,
i
think
it's
an
entirely
rational
statute.
i
think
this
has
three
times
been
so
read
by
this
court.
it
is
barring
the
liability
of
the
employee
and
those
who
claim
through
the
employee
because
of
the
injury
or
death.
the
government
in
its
reading
would
exclude
the
limiting
clauses
which
i
have
summarized
as
saying
those
who
claim
through
the
employee.
in
the
government's
reading
all
they
need
is
to
bar
liability
with
respect
to
the
death
to
any
person,
period.
if,
as
i
insist,
this
is
surplussage,
it
is
important
to
note
that
it
did
not
arise
because
of
hasty
drafting
on
the
floor
just
prior
to
enactment
of
the
statute.
it
has
deliberately
been
enacted
by
four
legislatures,
all
using
virtually
identical
words:
the
new
york
legislature
in
1922
when
it
passed
its
workmen's
compensation
act;
the
federal
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
of
1927
when
they
copied
virtually
intact
the
words
from
the
new
york
statute;
the
congress
again
in
1949
when
this
act
was
passed;
and
again
in
1966
when
title
v
was
codified.
i
would
think
the
government
should
have
some
explanation
for
what
by
its
reading
must
be
a
pervasive
and
persistent
addiction
to
surplussage
over
a
period
of
60
years
by
four
legislatures.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
no,
sir.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
no,
sir.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
i
would
say
that
under
the
very
familiar
principles
of
ejusdem
generis
that
coverall
phrase
is
intended
to
refer
to
others
of
the
same
class.
for
example,
the
draftsmen
in
looking
to
those
who
might
be
claiming
through
the
employee
could
not
know
what
varieties
of
persons
under
one
state
law
or
another
would
have
that
right.
for
one
of
many
examples
one
can
take
the
guardian
ad
lidem
for
a
minor
dependent.
obviously,
to
be
safe
you
would
want
a
coverall
clause.
this
court
has
three
times
approached
this
language
with
consistent
results,
a
consistency
not
shown
by
the
government.
in
the
ryan
case,
ryan
against
pan-atlantic
steamship
company
in
the
350th
united
states,
the
court
quoted
these
provisions
in
their
almost
identical
form
as
they
appeared
in
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
and
said:
"the
obvious
purpose
of
this
provision
is
to
make
the
employer's
compensation
liability
exclusive
to
anyone
claiming
under
or
through
such
employee.
"
--that
limiting
phrase
was
repeated
twice
at
page
129
of
the
350th
united
states.
that
interpretation
was
adopted
at
the
urging
of
the
government.
seven
years
later
this
court
considered
weyerhaeuser
steamship
company
against
the
united
states.
this
time
the
words
were
those
in
this
statute,
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act.
mr.
justice
stewart,
writing
for
a
unanimous
court,
turned
to
these
words
and
said
that
the
government's
contention
as
to
their
plain
meaning
was
not
at
all
plain.
this
time
the
government
was
containing...
contending
that
plainly
the
provision
barred
any
third
party
claim
over.
he
referred
to
the
principle
of
ejusdem
generis
in
reaching
that
conclusion.
he
went
on
to
examine
the
legislative
history,
and
he
found
that
that
history
was
clear,
that
the
remedy
of
the
compensation
act
was
made
exclusive
for
the
government
employees
and
their
representatives
or
dependents,
and
that
there
was
no
evidence,
i
quote,
"no
evidence
whatever
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
rights
of
unrelated
third
parties.
"
again
this
court
in
federal
marine
terminals
against
burnside
terminal...
burnside
shipping
company
six
years
later
in
the
394th
united
states
similarly...
similarly
read
the
provisions
as
stating
that
there
was
no
quid
pro
quo
for
third
persons,
and
the
statute
was
not
to
be
thought
to
extend
to
them.
quote,
"on
the
contrary,
as
emphasized
in
ryan,
the
act
is
concerned
only
with
the
rights
and
obligations
as
between
the
stevedore...
stevedoring
contractor
and
the
employee
or
his
representative.
"
if
the
court
will
forgive
me,
i
will
need
a
bit
of
water
before
i
attack
long
words.
we
see
no
occasion
to
retrace
the
legislative
history
which
was
covered
in
justice
stewart's
opinion
in
the
weyerhaeuser
case.
we
have
printed
the
committee
reports
which
are
the
sole
explanation
of
these
exclusive
liability
provisions.
we
do
note,
however,
that
in
that
statute,
statutory
history,
the
court
said
that
the
statute
was
drawn
from
the
longshoremen
workers...
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
and
from
the
new
york
statute
in
1922.
in
1938,
11
years
before
this
enactment,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
decided
the
westchester
lighting
case.
there
an
employee
of
the
development
company
was
asphyxiated
when
another
employee
broke
the
gas
main
of
the
lighting
company.
the
employee
received
an
award,
then
obtained
a
judgment
against
the
lighting
company
which
claimed
over
for
tort
indemnity
against
the
development
company.
the
court
of
appeals
allowed
the
claim,
stating
that
the
lighting
company
sued
for
its
own
injury
and
not
for
the
injury
to
the
deceased
employee.
by
1949
when
this
statute
was
enacted,
the
new
york
rule
had
become
firmly
established.
it
had
been
applied
in
a
number
of
the
lower
new
york
cases
once
again
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york.
the
lower
federal
courts
addressing
the
same
words
in
the
longshoremen's
act
had
by
a
large
majority
allowed
the
claim,
typically
in
reliance
upon
the
westchester
reasoning.
the
government
has
not
seen
fit
to
address
the
impact
of
the
new
york
rule
upon
this
case.
if
it
did,
so
far
as
i
could
tell
it
would
be
forced
to
urge
upon
this
court
that
neither
the
members
of
congress
nor
the
congressional
committees
or
the
staff
or
the
committees
or
the
lawyers
at
the
federal
security
agency,
which
drafted
this
statute
by
copying
the
provisions
of
the
new
york
statute,
had
any
idea
how
the
new
york
statute
had
been
interpreted.
it
seems
to
us
most
improbable.
i'd
like
to
return
for
a
moment
to
the
merits
of
the
weyerhaeuser
case.
there
an
army
dredge
collided
with
the
weyerhaeuser
liner
off
the
coast
of
oregon.
a
civilian
government
employee
was
aboard
the
dredge,
and
after
receiving
award
under
the
compensation
act
brought
suit
against
weyerhaeuser
and
received
a
judgment.
the
admiralty
court
found
both
vessels
at
fault
and
divided
damages.
weyerhaeuser
presented
in
its
bill
the
payment
made
to
the
government
employee.
this
court
sustained
weyerhaeuser's
position
unanimously.
i
find
no
way
to
distinguish
in
terms
of
section
8116(c)
the
admiralty
claim
for
damages
and
the
tort
indemnity
claim
for
restitution.
the
government's
principal
distinction
as
i
read
their
discussion
is
that
weyerhaeuser
dealt
with
an
admiralty
rule,
that
of
divided
damages,
of
ancient
vintage
and
well
established.
well,
so,
too,
tort
indemnity
is
a
remedy
long
established,
found
in
decisions
of
this
court
for
more
than
a
century
past.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
yes,
sir.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
i
plan,
if
your
honor
will
give
me
a
minute
or
two
to,
in
the
vernacular,
go
to
town
on
that
one.
it
is
to
my
mind
something
that
deserves
a
great
deal
of
comment,
all
of
which
should
be
adverse.
nothing
in
section
8116(c)
draws
any
distinction
between
admiralty
and
law,
between
divided
damages
and
tort
indemnity,
nor
indeed
any
distinction
between
the
government
employee
who
travels
on
an
army
dredge
in
contrast
to
the
one
who
travels
on
an
air
force
plane.
i
come
now
to
the
independent
duty
basis
of
the
decision
below.
the
court's
opinion
seems
to
me
to
have
been
a
quite
remarkable
one.
it
dutifully
quoted
the
words
of
section
8116(c)
and
never
again
referred
to
them.
it
made
no
reference
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
provision.
it
paid
no
attention
to
the
new
york
rule.
it
made
no
meaningful
citation
of
the
weyerhaeuser
case
and
none
at
all
of
the
ryan
case.
instead,
it
said
that
for
lockheed
to
recover
it
must
show
an
independent
duty,
independent,
that
is,
of
the
claim
of
the
employee,
and
that
lockheed
had
not
shown
a
duty
which
was
so
independent.
in
my
view
the
term
"independent
duty"
does
nothing
but
to
generate
what
might
be
called
a
metaphysical
fog
which
obscures
the
true
issue
in
the
case.
the
true
issue
must
necessarily
be
what
did
the
legislature
enact.
the
term
is,
moreover,
inevitably
and
inherently
question-begging.
every
third
party
claim
will
necessarily
involve
the
death
or
the
injury
of
the
employee.
that
necessary
ingredient
to
the
action
is
in
the
but-for
sense
a
cause
of
the
action.
the
observe
side
of
this
elusive
coin
is
that
every
third
party
claim
also
involve
another
ingredient:
the
injury
to
the
third
party
inflicted
when
it
is
required
to
respond
in
judgment
because
of
the
negligence
of
the
government
or
the
employer.
i
know
of
no
way
in
which
these
interrelated
duties
could
be
said
to
be
either
independent
or
to
be
derivative.
that's
not
entirely
accurate.
i
know
one
way,
which
is
to
look
to
the
judgment
and
then
go
back
and
describe
the
duty
as
independent
or
as
derivative
according
to
the
result.
the
last
thought
which
i
would
like
to
present
to
the
court
relates
to
the
policies
which
the
congress
has
uniformly
followed
in
these
exclusive
liability
provisions.
it
has
never
curtailed
a
right
or
a
remedy
without
offering
a
compensating
benefit
called
sometimes
in
the
committee
reports
a
quid
pro
quo.
thus,
the
employee,
who
is
forbidden
to
bring
suit
against
the
government
in
search
of
a
jury
verdict,
is
given
a
fast,
fault-free,
prompt
award,
which
at
least
in
the
years
close
to
the
enactment
of
the
provision
is
a
generous
one.
the
government,
stripped
of
its
customary
defenses,
or
the
stevedoring
employer
in
the
other
act
of
contributory
negligence,
assumption
of
risk
and
so
on,
gains
a
ceiling,
a
definite,
assured
limit
to
its
liability.
in
1972
the
congress
amended
the
longshoremen's
act
in
two
respects.
first,
it
eliminated
the
liability
without
fault
of
the
vessel
based
on
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine
to
the
longshoremen.
having
done
that,
and
only
because
it
did
that,
it
went
on
to
eliminate
the
claim
over
by
the
vessel
against
the
stevedore
on
the
ground
that
if
the
vessel
was
now
liable
only
for
its
own
negligence,
there
was
no
occasion
to
limit
the
claim
over.
the
government
here
asks
the
court
to
do
to
the
same
words
in
this
statute
what
the
congress
was
required
to
do
to
the
same
words
in
the
longshoremen's
act.
it
asks,
moreover,
that
this
court
act
without
the
sensitivity
to
the
equities
of
the
third
person
held
liable
without
fault
which
the
congress
betrayed
in
the
1972
amendments.
we
suggest
that
the
government's
request
that
you
usurp
the
power
to
the
congress
exercises
more
harshly
than
the
congress
would
should
be
denied.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
that
has
already
been
determined,
your
honor.
the
district
court
found
first
that
there
was
a
substantive
right
to
indemnity;
second,
that
there
was
no
bar
found
in
8116(c).
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
face
that
question.
it
was
not
appealed
to
it.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
touch
the
substantive
right
of
indemnity.
it
was
not
presented
to
it
by
the
government's
appeal.
it
said
that
absent
an
independent
duty
that
indemnity
was
barred.
if
the
bar
of
8116(c)
were
eliminated,
the
unappealed
judgment
of
the
district
court
on
indemnity
remains,
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
remand
to
have
that
one
determined.
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
it's
not
worth
very
much,
your
honor.
under
the
executive
jet
decision--
mr.
warner
w.
gardner
--we
think
it
unlikely
that
we
have
an
admiralty
claim,
but
no
one
could
be
absolutely
sure
whether
this
vessel...
this

i
would
like
to
reserve
what
few
minutes
i
have
left,

mr.
warner
w.
gardner
if
i
can
indulge
the
court's
patience
for
about
one
and
a
half
to
two
minutes,
i
have
a
comment
or
two
i
would
like
to
make.
mr.
warner

maybe
i
can
hand
back
a
half
a
minute
of
a
minute,
sir.
the
government
continues
to
state
that
the
concern
of
congress
for
the
expense
and
the
cost
of
litigation
indicates
that
they're
right
here.
this
court
said
in
stewart,
as
we've,
i
think,
demonstrated
in
our
quotation
as
to
the
legislative
history,
congress
was
concerned,
but
it
was
concerned
with
the
cost
and
the
expense
of
litigation
brought
by
the
government
employee.
it
never
thought
of
the
third
person.
the
weight
of
authority
in
the
state
courts
is
a
more
complex
inquiry
than
the
government
has
indicated.
professor
larson,
their
favorite
employee
or
commentator,
does
not
distinguish
according
to
the
terms
of
the
statute.
of
the
38
cases
cited
by
him,
19
relate
to
states
in
which
there
is
a
broad
and
comprehensive
elimination
of
liability.
the
remaining
19
are
divided
roughly
6
to
6
if
one
excludes
the
7
state
cases
which
were
concerned
with
state
tort
indemnity
or
contribution
law,
not
with
the
bar
of
the
statute.
we're
left,
i
think,
without
any
form
of
guidance
if
we
look
to
the
majority
view
of
the
states.
but
i
don't
believe
we
should.
i
think
the
new
york
statute,
explicitly
adopted
by
the
congress
and
firmly
interpreted
by
1949...
the
criticisms
of
the
new
york
rule
are
those
of
the
second
circuit
after
1949.
at
the
time
this
statute
was
adopted
there
was
not
question.
the
tortfeaser
point,
whether
or
not
we
are
claiming
something
like
contribution,
i
think
can
be
put
aside.
as
justice
stevens
explained
in
the
northwest
airlines
case,
tort
indemnity
is
like
the
ancient
chancery
remedy
coming
into
play
when
there
is
an
inadequacy
of
the
legal
remedy.
and
it
could
well
be
in
that
one
state
or
another
there
would
be
difficulties
with
a
joint
tortfeaser
contribution.
but
the
principle
of
restitution
which
underlies
tort
indemnity
now,
as
in
the
13th
and
14th
centuries,
is
expected
to
fill
the
need.
that
was
discussed
very
thoroughly
in
the
new
york
and
the
illinois
cases
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
one
last
thought
on
the
stencel
case.
the
government
naturally
seizes
upon
one
of
the
three
factors
which
the
court
in
the
aggregate
found
sufficient
to
bar
recovery
over
by
the
contractor.
those
three
factors
were
the
preeminence
of
the
federal
interest
and
the
undesirability
of
subjecting
it
to
state
law
in
the
conduct
of
military
operations.
the
second
factor
was
the
compensation
system
which
was
in
effect
for
the
serviceman.
the
third
fact
is
the
overwhelming
factor,
in
my
view,
is
the
fact
you
can
neither
discipline
troops
nor
conduct
wars
in
terms
of
tort
litigation.
i
would
suggest
that
the
brown
case,
decided
after
feres,
and
the
brooks
case
cited
before
it
dealing
with
ex-servicemen
and
dealing
with
off-duty
servicemen
and
finding
feres
inapplicable
even
though
there
was
a
compensation
system
suggests
that
the
military
discipline
factor
is
the
preeminent
one.
thank
you.
