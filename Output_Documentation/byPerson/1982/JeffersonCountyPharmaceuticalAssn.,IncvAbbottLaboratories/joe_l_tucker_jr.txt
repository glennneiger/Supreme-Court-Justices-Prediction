mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
prohibitions
of
the
robinson-patman
act
apply
to
sales
of
drugs
to
governmental
agencies
where
those
governmental
agencies
act
in
direct
competition
with
private
enterprise.
that
is,
are
agencies
of
jefferson
county,
alabama
and
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
university
of
alabama
exempt
per
se
from
the
application
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
even
though
they
compete
with
privately-owned
enterprises;
in
particular
in
this
case,
retail
pharmacists.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
we
do
not
have
any
firm
statistics
with
that
regard,
although
a
thorough
investigation
was
made
prior
to
filing
the
complaint,
and
that
investigation
did
reveal
plenty
of
facts
sufficient
to
substantiate
the
complaint,
with
the
exception,
of
course,
the
ruling
of
the
district
court.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
i
would
agree,
justice
o'connor,
that
many
states
have
undertaken
to
provide
care
to
the
indigent
sick.
however,
i
will
not
agree
that
providing
of
health
care
services
is
a
traditional
government
function.
i
would
also
not
agree--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--i
agree
that
some
states
have
assumed
part
of
that
responsibility,
but
i
could
not
agree
that
it
was
a
traditional
governmental
function
of
states
or
counties
to
provide--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
state
this
based
on
not
only...
with
regard
to
indigent
services,
that
may
be
true.
but
in
our
case,
the
allegations
were
going
not
just
to
services
for
the
indigent,
but
to
the
general
public
as
a
whole;
paying
persons
as
well
as
those
on
medicaid,
and
drugs
being
purchased
by
medicaid.
this
case
began
in
1978
when
jefferson
county
pharmaceutical
association
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
alabama
seeking
injunctive
relief
and
treble
damages
against
15
drug
manufacturers,
and
jefferson
county
and
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
university
of
alabama
medical
school.
the
two
hospitals,
jefferson
county's
charitable
institution,
cooper
green
hospital,
and
the
university
of
alabama
hospita
were
operating
pharmacies
in
direct
competition
with
private
retail
pharmacists.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
where
the
pharmacy
was
with
regard
to
the
one
operated
by
the
university
of
alabama.
the
university
of
alabama
medical
center
has
a
hospital
and
that
hospital
has
a
pharmacy
approximately
on
the
15th
and
16th
floors.
that
pharmacy
was
not
the
one
selling
drugs
to
the
general
public,
but
a
separate
pharmacy
located
away
from
the
hospital,
at
street
level,
nice,
comfortable
chairs
in
the
lobby
for
people
to
come
in
and
wait
on
their
prescriptions
to
be
filled
off
the
street,
the
general
public,
to
be
served.
all
of
the
defendants
filed
motions
to
dismiss
claiming
that
the
sales
to
governmental
agencies
were
exempt
from
the
application
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendants
and
held
that
sales
to
the
county
and
state
agencies'
pharmacies
were
beyond
the
reach
of
the
robinson-patman
price
discrimination
act
without
regard
to
15
usc
13c,
which
is
the
non-profit
exemption
act.
petitioner
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
now
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
that
court
affirmed
the
district
court
without
opinion.
just
noting
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
however,
judge
clark
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
stating
that
the
court
had
created
a
near-exemption
to
the
act.
he
stated
that
this
exemption
allowed
governmental
agencies
to
compete
in
the
private,
proprietary
sector
of
commerce,
and
use
its
superior
buying
power
against
businessmen
operating
private
retail
drug
stores.
first
of
all,
purchases
for
resale
that's
the
key
here
in
this
case.
this
case
is
very
similar,
of
course,
to
abbott
laboratories
versus
portland
retail
druggists
association,
where
this
court
held
that
the
robinson-patman
act
applied
to
sales
to
private
hospitals.
that
case,
of
course,
did
not
reach
the
issue
here
where
that
case,
as
i
understand
it,
there
were
not
it
was
not
before
this
court
the
issue
of
governmental
agencies
selling
to
general
public.
the
antitrust
laws
do
apply
to
anti-competitive
conduct
of
state
and
local
governments
when
engaged
in
proprietary
functions.
this
has
been
cited
in
the
city
of
lafayette
versus
louisiana
power
where
this
court
held
that
the
word
"persons"
as
used
in
the
antitrust
laws,
includes
states
and
their
political
subdivisions.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
apply.
the
case--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--the
case
of
champaign-urbana
news
i
believe
spoke
to
that
issue,
a
similar
issue,
except
that
in
that
case,
champaign-urbana
news
sought
to
apply
the
robinson-patman
act
to
the
secretary
of
the
army
and
secretary
of
the
air
force.
and
of
course,
this
court
held
that
it
could
be
not
applied;
that
the
secretary
of
army
and
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
were
immune.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
didn't.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don't.
the--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
i
think
that
the
cafeteria
here
would
be
very
similar
to
the
situation
possibly
in
general
shale
versus
struck
construction
company.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
if
that
were
the
case,
your
honor,
and
they
were
in
direct
competition,
of
course,
the
difference
here
is
federal
versus
state
and
local.
i
think
my
understanding
of
the
case
is
there's
no
question
but
that
the
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
through
the
commerce
powers,
activities
of
the
state
and
local
governments.
whether
or
not--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
i
think
there
is
some
distinction
in
what
is
happening
there
in
that
there,
the
hospital
pharmacies
are
buying
the
drugs
for
the
purpose
of
intent
of
reselling--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--no,
sir.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
the
hospital
may
be
competitive
with
other
hospitals,
and
i
think
that
from
justice
o'connor's
comment
there
has
been
some
recognition
that
some
hospital
activities,
although
it's
not,
according
to
the
case
of
swain
versus
milford
city
hospital,
inc.,
it's
not
a
traditional
governmental
function.
those
activities
have
been
sanctioned
to
some
extent.
but
here
you
have
something
that
is
completely
outside
the
traditional
function
of
government,
and
that
is
the
operation
of
retail
pharmacies.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
depend
entirely
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
whether
there
was
a
resale
in
competition,
or
whether
or
not,
for
instance,
they
were
giving
away
the
drugs.
i
think--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--well,
i
would
have
to
say,
your
honor,
that
if
drugs
were
sold
and
they
were
sold
in
competition
with
private
enterprise
and
they
were
obtained
through
discriminatory
price
bidding,
then
they
would
have
to
fall
within
the
proscriptions
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
there
are--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
in
alabama
this
has
not
been
a
function
of
state
government.
in
fact,
it's
not
even
authorized
by
the
state
code.
the
code...
nowhere
have
i
been
able
to
find
in
the
code
of
alabama,
1975
edition,
anything
that
authorizes
any
state
agency,
including
hospitals,
to
sell
drugs
to
the
general
public.
this
is
something
that
has
occurred
and
evolved
through
the
development
of
the
university
of
alabama
in
birmingham
which
covers
a
60-square
block
area
of
downtown
birmingham.
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
legislative
history.
it
appears,
from
the
cases,
that
certainly,
an
exemption
should
not
be
carved
out.
an
exemption
should
be
just
limited
to
the
exemption
stated.
and
there
is
an
exemption
for
private,
non-profit
hospitals.
that
exemption,
the
non-profit
institution
act,
in
fact,
does
cover
governmental
agencies.
but
the
legislative
history
supports
our
position
that
purchases
by
state
and
county
agencies
are
covered
by
the
act
when
those
agencies
use
those
goods
in
competition
with
private
retail
pharmacies,
rather
than
consuming
them
for
their
own
use.
i'd
point
to
mr.
teegarden's
testimony
in
the
petitioner's
brief
on
the
merits,
pages
9
and
10,
page
12,
pages
15
and
16.
there,
mr.
teegarden
explained
that
the
state
or
federal
government,
whichever,
is
saved
by
its
function.
that
is,
it
was
never
envisioned
that
the
state
or
the
federal
government
would
be
in
competition
with
private
enterprise.
that
they
would
take
on
this
anti-competitive
nature
and
compete
with
private
enterprise.
he
stated
that
the
reason
they
were
not
subject
to
the
robinson-patman
act,
in
his
testimony,
was
because
they
were
not
in
competition.
he
went
on
to
say
that
if
a
city
hospital
competed
with
a
privately-owned
hospital
that
it
would
be
subjected
to
the
proscriptions
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
so
certainly,
the
legislative
history
of
mr.
teegarden
when
he
was
testifying
before
the
senate
or
house
committee,
covered
this
area.
he
covered
this
problem
and
stated
that
if
they
enter
into
competition,
then
they
are
going
to
be
required
to
adhere
to
the
proscriptions
of
the
act.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
that's
correct.
so
long
as
it
is
restricted
to
that
agency's
own
use,
whether
it
was
its
dependents...
i
mean,
employees
or
dependents
of
the
employees--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--they
would
only
let
students
patronize
the
drug
store?
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
students
would
be
covered.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
faculty
and
staff
members
could
purchase.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
in
my
understanding
of
students,
it
would
not
apply,
according
to
my
reading
of
abbott
laboratories
versus
portland
retail
druggists.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
they
could
purchase,
also.
my
reading
of
abbot
laboratories
versus
portland
retail
druggists
allows
faculty
members,
staff
and--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--no,
sir.
there
is
no
exemption
other
than
the
non-profit
institutions
act.
there
is
no
exemption
spoken
to
in
the
entire
act.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
mr.
teegarden's
theory
is
what
i'm
saying--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--right.
there
would
be
an
exemption;
even
though
the
act
applies
there
would
be
an
exemption
to
take
it
out
from
under
the
proscriptions
of
the
act
if
it
meets
the
test
of
abbott
laboratories,
which
considered
13c.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
as
stated.
the
portland
retail
druggist
in
my
reading
of
it
is
the
same
as
what
we
have
here
except
that
we
have
governmental
institutions
competing
with
private
enterprise
as
opposed
to
private
persons.
if
i
may
comment
with
regard
to
the
non-profit
institutions
act,
that
act
exempts
purchases
for
consumption
by
both
non-profit
and
charitable
governmental
institutions.
my
question
would
be
why
would
congress,
two
years
after
the
robinson-patman
act,
enact
the
non-profit
institutions
act
if
there
was
a
per
se
exemption
already?
it
is
only
logical
that
the
non-profit
institutions
act
was
enacted
to
create
this
exemption
for
non-profit
charitable
institutions
and
governmental
institutions.
and
i
would
point
to--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--well,
if
i
may
point
to
the
legislative
history
of
that,
justice
o'connor,
representative
walter's
testimony...
and
that's
found
on
pages
8
and
9
of
our
reply
brief,
and
on
pages
11
and
12
of
the
amicus
brief
of
the
national
association
of
retal
druggists.
representative
walter's
testimony
there
specifically
stated
that
the
non-profit
institutions
act
applied
both
to
charitable
institutions
and
to
governmental
agencies
such
as
governmental
hospitals.
further,
the
case
of
logan
lanes
versus
brunswick
held
that
the
sales
of
bowling
equipment
to
the
utah
state
university
were
exempt
because
that
bowling
equipment
and
those
bowling
lanes
were
being
used
for
the
university's
own
use,
and
it
went
into
detail
to
discuss
how
it
was
used
in
the
pd
program
in
the
teaching
of
classes,
used
by
faculty
members,
used
in
physical
education
by
the
students,
et
cetera.
further,
in
the
city
of
lafayette
case,
as
found
at
425
us,
at
page
397,
footnote
14,
this
court
exempted...
stated
in
that
footnote
that
libraries
were
exempt
because
they
made
purchases
for
their
own
use.
further,
i
would
point
to
the
motions
to
dismiss
by
nine
of
the
defendants
in
this
case.
those
motions
are
found
in
the
joint
appendix
pages
19a
to
48a.
nine
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
concede
that
the
non-profit
institutions
act
applies
to
governmental
purchasers.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
non-profit
institutions
act
applies
to
governmental
purchases
then,
of
course,
the
robinson-patman
act
would
have
to
apply
to
those
purchases.
further,
the
attorneys
general
of
the
states
of
california
and
georgia--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--i
think
so,
your
honor.
nine
of
the
defendants...
and
in
fact,
one
of
those
defendants
is
cooper
green
hospital.
cooper
green
hospital,
in
my
opinion,
by
filing
this
amendment,
concedes
that
the
act
applies
by
claiming
the
exemption
under
13c.
the
attorneys
general
of
california
and
georgia
have
held
that
the
robinson-patman
act
applies
to
governmental
bodies
when
they
act
in
competition
with
private
enterprise.
these
opinions
of
the
attorneys
general
are
referred
to
in
our
brief
at
page
13
and
pages
14
and
15
of
the
amicus
brief
of
the
national
association
of
retail
druggists.
in
the
case
referred
to
by
the
georgia
attorney
general,
the
state
was
running
a
factory
for
the
blind,
and
in
that
opinion,
the
attorney
general
found
that
the
robinson-patman
act
did
not
apply
to
sales
by
that
factory
for
the
blind
because
they
were...
the
sales
were
made
to
state
agencies.
but
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
factory
for
the
blind
would
divest
itself
of
its
sovereignty
if
it
acted
in
a
proprietary
interest.
that
is,
if
it
sold
goods
out
of
that
factory
to
the
general
public,
if
it
got
outside
of
sales
to
state
agencies
and
to
the
state
itself.
once
it
got
outside
that
sphere,
then
its
sales
would
be
subject
to
the
robinson-patman
act.
further,
i
would
point
to
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
would
say
that
the
cases
and
other
authorities
cited
by
the
district
court
do
not
support
its
ruling.
each
and
every
of
the
cases
cited
as
authority
by
the
district
court
did
not
consider
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
sales
by
governmental
agencies
were
being
made
to
the
general
public
in
direct
competition.
none
of
those
cases
and
none
of
those
citations
considered
that
point.
the
case
of
general
shale
versus
struck
which
i've
already
mentioned
was
one
of
the
cases
relied
upon
by
judge
pointer
of
the
northern
district
of
alabama,
in
that
case
there
was
no
sale
of
brick.
further,
the
brick
was
used
by
the
city
of
louisville,
kentucky
for
its
own
use
in
building
a
housing
project.
and
thus,
since
there
was
no
sale
and
it
was
for
their
own
use,
there
was
no
competition.
further,
another
case
cited
by
the
district
court,
gulf
oil
versus
copp,
turned
on
the
fact
that
there
was
no
interstate
commerce.
so
that
case
is
inapplicable.
the
case
of
logan
lanes
versus
brunswick.
that's
a
ninth
circuit
case
that
affirmed
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
a
plaintiff's
case
against
brunswick
on
the
basis
that
the
non-profit
institutions
act
applied.
because
the
non-profit
institutions
act
applied
and
the
state
university
was
using
the
bowling
lanes
were
for
their
own
use,
again,
they
were
exempt
because
of
that.
further,
the
attorneys
general's
opinions
cited
by
the
district
court
did
not
consider
purchases
that
were
being
made
for
the
purpose
of
resale
by
state
and
local
agencies.
they
did
not
consider
the
factor
of
competition
with
private
enterprise.
the
opinions
of
the...
i
might
add,
too,
that
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
speaks
to
purchases
by
federal
government
and
not
to
state
and
local
agencies.
and
i
think
that's
the
key
difference
there.
the
opinions
of
the
attorneys
general
of
minnesota,
wisconsin
and
north
carolina
were
cited
by
the
district
court,
but
again,
in
each
of
these
opinions,
it
was
not
considered...
there
was
no
consideration
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
competition
with
private
enterprise.
i'd
like
to
save
a
few
minutes.
thank
you.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
no,
sir,
we
did
not
get
that
far.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
no
record
other
than
the
pleadings.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
klingsberg
states
categorically
that
the
non-profit
institutions
act
does
not
apply
to
government
institutions.
i
would
point
the
court
to
page
34-a
and
page
35-a
of
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case,
in
which
mr.
klingsberg's
name
appears
of
counsel.
his
law
firm's
name
appears
of
counsel
on
behalf
of
charles
pfizer
and
company,
and
in
his
motion
to
dismiss
before
the
district
court,
paragraph
number
5
states,
sales
of
goods...
states
as
a
ground
for
dismissing
the
case,
sales
of
goods
alleged
to
have
been
made
at
discriminatory
prices
that
were
lawful
under
15
usc
section
13(c).
why,
then,
if
it
does
not
apply,
did
they
plead
it
in
this
case?
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
sir?
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
no,
sir,
but
i
think
that--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--i
think--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--i
think
at
this
point
that
it
at
least
serves
as
an
admission
that--
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
--they
thought
it
applied
at
that
time.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
would
also
point
to
the...
to
page
8
and
9
of
our
reply
brief,
that
tracks
the
legislative
history,
the
testimony
by
mr.
walter,
who
was
the
sponsor
of
the
non-profit
institutions
act,
and
mr.
saddle
asked
him,
"does
the
gentleman
think
a
county
hospital
or
a
city
sanitarium
wholly
financed
by
a
city,
county,
or
state
would
come
within
the
provisions
of
this
act.
"
meaning
the
non-profit
institutions
act.
mr.
walter
responded,
"yes,
i
do".
mr.
walter
was
a
sponsor
of
that
act.
further,
mr....
as
justice
powell...
justice
stevens
mentioned,
mr.
teagarden
did
not
categorically
state
that
the
government
was
exempt
from
the
robinson-patman
act.
he
qualified
it.
the
question
was,
the
federal
government
is
not
in...
the
statement
was
by
mr.
teagarden,
the
federal
government
is
not
in
competition
with
other
buyers
from
these
concerns.
the
federal
government
is
saved
by
the
same
distinction,
not
of
location,
but
of
function.
they
are
not
in
competition
with
anyone
else
who
would
buy.
that
is
what
mr.
teagarden
says
with
regard
to
that
provision.
also,
i
would
like
to
mention
very
briefly
mr.
klingsberg's
reference
to
the
failure
of
congress
to
act
on
six
subsequent
proposed
amendments.
those
first
two
proposed
amendments
in
1951
and
'53
were
proposed
for
the
purpose
of
restricting
federal,
state,
and
local
governmental
purchases
generally
and
arguably
would
have
extended
to
purchases
by
the
government
for
their
own
use.
the
last
four
bills
which
were
proposed
by
mr.
keogh
did
not
even
speak
to
state
and
local
governments.
it
went
directly
to
federal
agencies
alone,
and
certainly
that
can't
be
given
any
credence
toward
this
case
when
those
last
four
bills
did
not
speak
to
state
and
local
governments
whatsoever,
but
were
limited
to
federal
concerns.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
well,
the
legislative
history
seems
to
believe
that
it...
seems
to
say
that
it
does
cover
governmental
agencies.
mr.
walter
stated
in
his
testimony
before
the
committee
hearing
that,
yes,
it
does
cover
governmental
hospitals.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
sir?
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
in
those
areas,
yes,
sir,
government
hospitals,
in
the
instances
referred
to
by
justice
o'connor
for
health
care,
for
the
indigent,
it
would
be
covered
and
they
would
be
exempt
under
the
non-profit
institutions
act
for
that
purpose,
but
i
am
not
by
any
means
trying
to
say
that
it
should
be
applied
to
government
institutions
where
they
are
purchasing
for
their
own
use.
that
is
certainly
exempt.
mr.
joe
l.
tucker,
jr.
thank
you.
