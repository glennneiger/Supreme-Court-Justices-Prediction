justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
the
university
of
alabama
said
we'll
only
let
students
patronize
the
drug
store?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
students
aren't
covered,
but
are
the
drug
stores
covered?
you
say
it
would
not
apply
if
the
federal
government,
or
the
government
agency
restricted
the
resale
to
people
within...
for
whom
it
had
some
responsibility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i
take
it
you've
just
excluded
the
university
of
alabama
drug
store
if
they
say
nobody
but
students
can
buy
here.
students
or
faculty.
or
faculty,
yes.
so
you
would
exclude
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
about
students?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then,
the
only
competition
you're
talking
about
is
the
extent
to
which
the
university
drug
store
sells
to
members
of
the
general
public
who
are
not
either
students
or
faculty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
families
of
the
faculty
or
families
of
the
students?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
the
case,
it's
construing
an
exemption
from
the
act.
we
don't
have
an
exemption
here,
do
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
this
is
a
very
different
theory
from
mr.
teegarden's
theory
that
you
quote
i
think
three
times
in
your
briefs.
his
theory
was
there's
an
absence
of
injury
to
competition.
now
you're
relying...
you
say
that
isn't
the
test
at
all;
the
test
is
13c,
which
is
a
very
different
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
his
theory
came
before
there
was
any
13c.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
legal
basis
for
your
saying
this?
just
that
it
makes
good
sense?
because
you
certainly
can't
base
that
on
what
teegarden
said;
you
can't
base
it
on
13c.
it
may
make
a
lot
of
sense,
but
is
there
any
legal
foundation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
interrupt
a
minute.
they
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
one
of
the
grounds
of
the
motion
was
that
the
sales
allegedly
made
are
lawful
under
13c.
is
that
a
concession,
you
think,
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
klingsberg,
isn't
it
possible
that
in
1938,
congress
didn't
particularly
consider
the
primary
line
competition
problem
because
your
principal
focus
was
on
the
secondary
line
i
think,
in
the
teegarden
testimony
at
least,
and
that
the
assumption
that
it
didn't
apply
was
simply
based
on
the
assumption
that
you
wouldn't
have
competitive
injury
in
the
normal
case
where
there
are
sales
to
the
government.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
it's
conceivable,
as
this
case
demonstrates.
but
what
the...
the
agencies
they
talked
about,
the
large
purchase
contracts
and
so
forth,
in
the
attorney
general's
opinion,
were
those
where
there
wouldn't
be
any
realistic
likelihood
of
competitive
injury
at
the
secondary
line.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
my
very
point.
the
areas
of
government
purchases
that
are
mentioned
in
the
attorney
general's
opinion
and
in
the
relevant
discussion
by
teegarden
and
others
are
areas
in
which
there
would
be
no
competition
with
the
private
sector.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
in
38.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
think
is
the
strongest
case
or
opinion
supporting
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
the
accumulation
of
arguments.
you
don't
think
there's
one
case
that
you
can
point
to
that
really
is
quite
persuasive,
or
one
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
had
to
pick
out
the
one
authority
that
you
wanted
to
really
rest
on,
would
you
pick
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
emphasizes
competition,
is
the
problem
with
that.
he
emphasizes
the
absence
of
injury
to
competition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
doesn't
categorically
say
that
no
sale
to
government
could
ever
be
covered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
klingsberg,
may
i
ask
you
a
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--just
give
you
a
chance
to
comment
on
it?
i
don't
know
if
it's
totally
relevant
or
not,
but
among
the
amicus
briefs,
i
don't
find
a
brief
from
the
solicitor
general,
and
they
have
expressed
their
views
on
the
robinson-patman
act
in
several
cases
recently,
and
generally
have
not
been
sympathetic
to
the
statute,
and
their
client
surely
has
a
great
interest
in
the
outcome
of
this
case.
how
do
you
explain
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
that
i
have
thought
of
and
that
is
not
discussed
in
the
brief?
what
about
the
idaho...
north
dakota,
i
guess
it
is,
has
the
cement
plant,
reeves
against
state.
when
the
government
operates
as
a
market
participant
and
therefore
avoids
some
of
the
constitutional
problems
that
it
might
otherwise
have,
would
it
still
not
be
subject
to
the
robinson-patman
act
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
we
are
bound
by
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
we
bound
by
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
he
is
bound
by
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
he
withdraw
that
motion
if
he
wanted
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is
not
a
binding
admission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whoever
drafted
that
motion
thought
it
applied
when
he
filed
that
motion.
