justice

o'connor
i
suppose
on
the
status
of
this
case,
which
was
decided
basically
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint,
we
have
no
idea
what
percentage
of
the
pharmaceutical
products
were
sold
to
indigent
sick
or
what
part
to
the
public
in
general.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
agree
that
many
states
or
local
governments
in
states
do
and
have
traditionally
undertaken
to
provide
medical
care
and
services
to
the
indigent
sick?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
would
concede
that
it
is
in
some
states,
i
suppose;
those
who
since
statehood
have
assumed
that
responsibility?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
in
states
which
have
done
it
since
statehood?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
concede
that
to
the
extent
that
the
state
operated
its
public
hospital
and
its
pharmacy
within
that
hospital
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
indigent
sick
that
the
state
undertook
to
care
for,
that
even
under
your
test,
the
robinson-patman
act
would
not
apply?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
sold
very
cheaply
to
people
who
qualified
as
indigents
who
couldn't
afford
otherwise
to
buy
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wouldn't
that
have
the
effect
of
discouraging
states
and
local
governments
from
providing
certain
forms
of
assistance
to
the
indigent
sick?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
possible
that
it
was
enacted
only
to
aid
the
charitable
institutions?
wasn't
that
where
the
problem
was?
