mr.
david
klingsberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
sales
to
state
and
local
government
agencies
are
within
the
coverage
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
petitioner
has
drawn
the
issue
too
narrowly,
and
that
in
interpreting
congressional
intent
as
to
whether
the
robinson-patman
act
covered
state
and
local
government
agency
purchases
and
looking
at
the
language
of
the
act,
it
can't
simply
be
limited
to
drugs,
it
can't
simply
be
limited
to
hospitals
and
it
can't
simply
be
limited
to
the
state
of
alabama.
but
rather,
it
deals
with
the
entire
spectrum
of
government
agencies,
a
great
many
of
which
purchase
commodities
and
purchase
commodities
which
are
covered
by
the
robinson-patman
act
if
indeed
the
act
was
applicable,
whether
they're
sold
for
use
or
for
consumption
or
resale
under
the
terms
of
the
act.
therefore,
a
very
far-reaching
assertion
is
being
made
here
by
the
petitioner.
our
position,
based
on
legislative
history,
judicial
decisions
and
the
unanimous
view
of
the
commentators,
including
representative
patman,
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
apply
the
robinson-patman
act
to
purchases
by
state
and
governmental
agencies.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
concentrate
on
two
main
points;
one,
the
statutory
scheme
as
reflected
in
the
robinson-patman
act
of
1936
and
the
non-profit
institutions
act
of
1938,
which
we
say
is
logical
and
consistent
only
if
the
earlier
statute,
the
original
robinson-patman
act,
is
read
as
the
legislative
history
indicates;
not
to
reach
purchases
of
governmental
agencies.
and
this
conclusion
is
buttressed
by
congress's
rejection
in
1951
and
1953
of
specific
proposed
amendments
which
were
not
enacted
to
extend
the
statute's
reach
to
purchases
by
states
and
their
political
subdivisions.
and
thereafter,
congress
failed
to
act
despite
more
than
40
years
of
uniform
enforcement
agency
recognition--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--there
was
discussion--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--right.
there
was
discussion
in
the
oral
hearings
with
mr.
teegarden,
who
is
counsel
to
the
wholesalers
and
one
of
the
draftsman--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--well,
in
the
committee...
in
a
written
brief
which
mr.
teegarden
submitted,
he
was
asked
the
question:
would
the
bill
prevent
competitive
bidding
on
government
purchases
below
trade
price
levels.
and
he
answered
that
question
first
by
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
he
would
think
that
it
would
not
be
covered,
and
he
assured
congress
that
it
wouldn't
be
covered.
and
then
he
said
a
further
reason
was
the
effect
on
competition
because
of
the
requirements
relating
to
secondary
line
competition.
i
should
point
out,
your
honor,
that
the
robinson-patman
act
as
ultimately
passed
also
has
a
primary
line
provision
in
which
there
would
be
liability
where
there
is
a
sale
to
a
state,
for
example,
if
indeed
the
states
were
covered,
and
there
is
no
effect
on
competition
by
the
state
or
the
city
or
the
municipality
with
some
drug
store
or
retailer,
but
there
was
an
effect
on
competition
at
the
primary
line
level
between
the
sellers.
and
so
on
that
basis,
it
would
seem
that
the
resale
or
the
competition
are
not,
by
the
state,
would
not,
under
the
terms
of
the
statute,
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
the
act
applies
or
not.
and
mr.
teegarden's
written
report
indicates
the
categorical
elimination
of
applicability
and
assurance
to
the
congressmen
who
were
concerned
as
to
whether
or
not
the
states
and
municipalities
could
continue
their
practice
of
competitive
bidding
and
buy,
in
the
words
of
congressman
hancock
who
asked
one
of
the
questions,
at
the
cheapest
prices.
congress
was
concerned
that
the
states
and
cities
be
able
to
purchase
at
the
cheapest
prices
and
continue
the
practice,
which
they
have
today,
of
buying
at
prices
as
the
question
asked
in
the
written
report
says,
below
trade
price
levels.
now,--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--not
in
the
1951
and
53,
but
in
1968
and
69,
there
were
extensive
hearings
before
a
subcommittee
of
congress
on
small
business
which
dealt
with
this
very
problem.
the
whole
controversy
was
raised.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
kintner,
who
is
counsel
to
national
association
of
retail
druggists
who
is
one
of
the
principal
amici
here,
told
the
congressman
on
that
occasion
that
there
were
three
categories.
one
category
was
government,
and
that
was
not
covered
by
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
second
category
was
charitable
eleemosynary
institutions,
and
that
category
was
covered
by
the
robinson-patman
act
but
given
a
partial
exemption
under
the
non-profit
institution
act.
the
non-profit
institution
act
did
not
apply
to
government.
and
the
congressional
subcommittee
adopted
that,
quoted
it
in
its
report
and...
to
find
the
non-profit
institution
act
as
only
applying
to
private
charitable
institutions,
and
concluded
after
extensive
hearings
at
which
it
was
brought
out
that
there's
competition
between
drug
stores
and
hospital
pharmacies
and
so
forth,
there
was
testimony
by
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
that
went
on
for
weeks...
concluded
that
what
should
be
done
is
the
administrative
agencies
should
enforce
the
robinson-patman
act
as
against
the
non-profit,
non-governmental
private
charitable
hospitals
where
they
don't
meet
the
requirements
of
the
1938
act.
but
never
concluded
and
was
never
even
asked
by
the
national
association
of
retail
druggists
to
extend
the
basic
robinson-patman
act
to
cover
governmental
purchases.
so
congress--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--i
think
the
purpose
was
to
consider
the
problem
which
was
set
before
it
at
great
length
and
to
make
recommendations
which
was
a
recommendation
to
the
administrative
agencies
that
they
should
enforce
the
act
as
against
the
private,
charitable
hospitals.
now,
inherent
in
what
i've
been
saying,
if
your
honors
please,
is
that
to
appreciate
the
logic
of
the
statutory
scheme,
you
have
to
look
both
at
the
1936
act
and
the
1938
amendment.
my
proposition
is
that
the
1938
amendment
did
not
exempt
governmental
bodies
because
they
were
not
covered
by
the
robinson-patman
act
to
begin
with,
and
any
other
construction
would
be
illogical.
by
its
terms,
the
1938
amendment
provided
for
exemption
of
non-profit
institutions.
now,
that's
not
a
term
which
is
ordinarily
applied
to
government.
it's
not
the
term
which
congress
used
in
1951
and
1953
when
they
proposed
amendments.
the
called
the
state
the
states
and
political
subdivision
states
political
subdivisions.
the
non-profit
institutions
act
applies
to
purchases
for
own
use
by
schools,
colleges,
universities,
public
libraries,
churches,
hospitals
and
charitable
institutions,
not
operating
for
profit.
now,
charitable
institutions
and
churches
are
plainly
not
government.
others,
schools,
libraries
and
hospitals
theoretically
encompass
both
governmental
and
non-government
owned
bodies.
schools
can
be
private.
so
can
hospitals,
and
as
to
libraries,
despite
the
footnote
in
the
lafayette
case
which
respectfully,
we
say
is
wrong,
libraries
can,
i
was
very
interested
to
find
out,
be
privately
run,
privately
endowed,
open
to
the
public
libraries.
and
there
are
thousands
of
libraries
like
that
in
the
united
states.
now,
if
governmental
purchases
were
intended
to
be
covered
by
the
1938
exemption,
a
logical
legislature
surely
would
have
included
other
types
of
governmental
buyers.
why
would
you
have
just
three
exemptions
for
libraries,
schools
and
hospitals
and
apply
the
robinson-patman
act
without
any
exemption,
without
any
own-use
exception
to
police,
fire,
sanitation,
transit,
parks,
the
cafeteria
downstairs,
museums,
prisons
and
so
on.
an
irrational
statutory
scheme
would
result
if
the
robinson-patman
act
of
1936
were
interpreted
to
reach
purchases
of
all
governmental
entities
and
the
38
act
were
interpreted
just
to
exempt
partially
three
governmental
entities.
the
only
logical
conclusion
is
that
congress
believed,
as
the
legislative
history
supports,
that
government
purchases
were
not
covered
by
the
original
'36
act,
and
the
1938
act
only
applies
to
non-governmental
eleemosynary,
not-for-profit
schools,
hospitals,
libraries,
churches,--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--your
honor,
i
think
there
are
government
agencies,
in
addition
to
the
three
that
might
be
governmental
in
that
act,
which
compete,
would
sell
for
resale--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--well,
public
transit
competes
with
private
buses.
public
sanitation
competes
with
private.
cafeterias
compete
with
restaurants.
gift
shops
and
souvenir
shops
in
museums
compete.
i
think
there
are
many
areas
where
there
might
be
competition
which
aren't
mentioned
in
this
1938
act.
mr.
david
klingsberg
why
would
they
pick,
for
example,
libraries?
libraries
are
not
a
particularly--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--in
the
38
act.
why
would
they
pick
libraries,
which
ordinarily
would
not
be
viewed
as
competing
or
selling
for
resale?
why
would
they
pick
schools
or
hospitals
out
of
the
myriad
of
agencies?
it
seems
to
me
the
only
logical
conclusion
is
that
as
congress
indicated
in
the
senate
and
the
house
reports
on
the
1938
act,
that
was
dealing
with
eleemosynary
institutions.
that's
what
congress
said
in
both
the
senate
and
the
house
reports.
and
eleemosynary
institutions
are
private,
charitable
institutions.
that's
what
congress
said
again
in
1968
when
it
considered
the
matter.
and
therefore,
it
would
be
very
unreasonable
and
unfair
and
illogical
to
have
the
basic
robinson-patman
act
of
1936
applying
to
every
government
agency
and
the
1938
act
exempting
only
three.
and
that's
the
reason
why
the
logical
statutory
scheme,
rational
statutory
scheme
would
be
if
the
original
robinson-patman
act
did
not
cover
any
governmental
agencies
in
the
38
act;
only
exempted
non-profit,
private,
charitable,
eleemosynary
institutions.
mr.
david
klingsberg
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
a
conglomeration
of
all
of
the
factors
we
have
here.
mr.
teegarden's
written
statement,
representative
patman
in--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--one--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--i
don't
think
i
could
pick
one
more
than
the
other,
except
perhaps
mr.
teagarden's
written
statement.
mr.
david
klingsberg
he
says
that's
a
further
reason.
mr.
david
klingsberg
but
i
think
that
really--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--well,
he
says
that
eliminates
the
possibility,
meaning
there
is
no
possibility,
but
i
prefer
to
take
the
conglomeration
of
facts.
representative
patman
in
1938,
the
same
year
that
the
1938
act
was
passed,
said
in
his
treatise
that
the
robinson-patman
act
did
not
cover
governmental
purchases.
and
then,
15
years
later,
there
was
the
submission
of
the
two
bills
which
congress
failed
to
enact
which
would
have
expressly
extended.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
klingsberg
i
think
your
honors
defined
that
in
the
abbott
case,
in
a
very
complicated
way
for
hospitals,
and
i
suppose
if
that
were,
contrary
to
the
plain
wording
of
the
statute,
extended
to
every
single
governmental
agency--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--they
wouldn't
be
exempt.
mr.
david
klingsberg
because
it
wouldn't
be
for
own
use.
mr.
david
klingsberg
i
think
own
use
means--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
david
klingsberg
not
for
profit.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
klingsberg
i'd
say
it
covers
everything,
that
it
was
never
intended
to
be
covered
in
the
first
place.
i
said
government
was
not
intended
to
be...
purchases
by
government--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--yes.
i
say
that
because
mr.
teagarden
in
his
written
brief
gave
two
grounds,
and
the
first
ground
was
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
resale--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--i
can
only--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--there
is
not
any
explicitly.
no,
your
honor.
i
can
only
infer--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--in
the
original
statute?
mr.
david
klingsberg
that's
explicit
in
the
act.
mr.
david
klingsberg
the
latter,
your
honor.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
in
the
past--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--the
court
in
the
past
has
said,
for
example,
in
regard
to
the
sherman
act
where
there
is
no
expression
of
intent
one
way
or
the
other,
that
that
would
apply
to
cities,
for
example,
in
the
lafayette
and
boulder
case,
but
here
we
have
a
whole
host
of
indicia
which
the
court
has
traditionally
applied
in
terms
of
analyzing
the
purpose,
context,
legislative
history,
post-enactment
history,
et
cetera,
and--
mr.
david
klingsberg
--yes.
mr.
david
klingsberg
i
don't
know
if
this
is
proper
argument,
but
i
spoke
to
them...
i
spoke
to
the
proper
person
in
the
justice
department,
and
they
said,
this
is
a
question
of
pure
statutory
intent.
we
are
sure
you
can
argue
it
as
well
as
we
can.
there
is
no
economic
issues.
mr.
david
klingsberg
your
honor,
representative
patman
stated
in
his
book
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
has
ruled
that
the
act
does
not
apply
to
government,
meaning
federal
government,
and
it
may
be
presumed
that
his
reasoning
may
also
be
applied
to
municipal
and
public
institutions,
so
representative
patman
said
in
1938
that
he,
the
sponsor
of
this
bill,
the
man
whose
name
appears,
did
not
think
that
it
applied
at
all
to
governmental
purchases.
mr.
david
klingsberg
but
it's
the
same
time,
your
honor,
as
the
1938
act
was
proposed,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
any
sense
to
say
that
congress
in
1938
would
have
had
a
partial
exemption
for
just
three
kinds
of
governmental
entities
and
left
the
dozens
of
other
governmental
entities
subject
to
the
act
without
any
even
own
use
exception,
which
would
be
a
very
far-reaching
kind
of
holding,
and
very
unfair
and
illogical
to
have
in
the
one
sense
transit,
parks,
recreation,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
all
apply
without
any
exception
at
all,
and
to
just
pick
these
three,
schools,
hospitals,
and
libraries,
and
say,
well,
those
are
the
only
three
to
which
we
will
give
a
partial
exception.
it
seems
to
me
much
more
logical
to
say,
as
mr.
teagarden
indicated
in
his
written
report,
that
the
act
didn't
apply
to...
the
original
act
didn't
apply
to
government
at
all,
and
the
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
that
post-enactment
history
can
be
persuasive
evidence,
not
conclusive,
but
persuasive.
recently
mentioned
in
the
northhaven
case,
statutory
construction
has
been
fully
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress.
i
have
showed
how
that
occurred.
in
the
gulf
case,
gulf
against
kopp,
dealing
with
the
robinson-patman
act,
how
the
failure
of
congress
to
act
is
significant.
here
we
not
only
have
the
failure
of
congress
to
act,
we
have
specific
legislation
to
extend
coverage
being
proposed
and
that
not
being
accepted
by
the
congress.
the
court
has
said
that
the
positions
of
administrative
agencies
and
enforcement
agencies
has
great
weight.
there
has
never
been
a
case
on
record
where
the
department
of
justice
or
the
ftc,
charged
with
the
administration
of
this
act,
have
ever
applied
it
or
filed
a
claim
against
anyone
selling
to
or
any
state
or
governmental
agency
purchasing.
there
have
been
46
years
of
uniform
thought
among
commentators,
all
the
leading
commentators,
roven,
kolinowsky,
mr.
kintner,
the
counsel
to
the
national
association
of
retal
druggists,
all
believing
and
operating
on
the
premise
that
the
robinson-patman
act
does
not
apply
to
governmental
purchases,
and
we
think
under
these
circumstances,
where
the
act
has
been
universally
and
long
recognized
as
not
applying,
that
any
change--
mr.

--yes,
your
honor,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
very
point
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
at
great
length
in
the
1968
hearings.
there
was
testimony
by
numerous
representatives
of
the
drug
industry.
a
year
later
there
was
testimony
by
wholesalers,
but
automotive
industry
people,
all
saying
that
the
robinson-patman
act
does
not
apply
to
governmental
purchases,
and
that
there
are
a
lot
of
instances
in
a
variety
of
industries
where
government
competes,
and
congress's
only
reaction
to
that
was
to...
the
subcommittee's
reaction
was
to
render
a
report
saying,
well,
it
can
be
enforced
against
private
charitable,
eleemosynary
institutions
if
they
don't
comply
with
the
'38
exemption,
but
didn't
say
anything
about
applying
the
act
to
governmental
purchases
where
they
compete.
it's
a
situation
where,
to
take
the
words
of
prior
court
opinions,
there
has
been
public
controversy.
the
controversy
has
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
congress,
and
congress
has
not
acted,
and
that
is
persuasive
evidence,
in
light
of
all
the
facts
that
we
have,
under
traditional
criteria
applied
by
the
court,
that
the
act
was
not
intended
to
apply
in
the
first
place.
and
taking
all
that
into
account,
and
combining
it
with
the
statement
by
mr.
teagarden
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
congress
can
be
assured
that
the
act
will
not
apply
to
governmental
purchases,
and
that
these
government
bodies
can
continue,
as
the
congressman
expressed
concern
about,
to
have
competitive
bidding
and
to
purchase
at
cheapest
prices.
that's
what
congress
was
concerned
about.
mr.
teagarden
said,
don't
worry
about
it.
if
you
leave
out
the
government,
then
they
are
not
covered,
and
the
issue
is
not
whether
this
was
correct
statutory
interpretation
or
not,
as
the
court
recently
pointed
out
in
the
merrill
lynch
and
the
brown
case.
the
question
is,
how
did
congress
perceive
this,
not
whether
or
not
the
statutory
construction
was
correct,
although
i
think
that
there
is
support
which
we
cite
and
discuss
in
our
brief
for
the
point
that
this
statutory
construction
is
correct.
i
should
point
out
also
that
in...
there
have
been...
in
two
of
the
cases,
one
the
saks
case,
that
dealt
with
sales
to
government
liquor
stores,
and
the
general
shale
case
dealt
with
construction,
these
are
both
situations
where
the
government
did
not
compete,
and
this
was
an
alternative
ground
of
holding,
but
one
ground
of
holding
was
that
the
robinson-patman
act
did
not
mean
to
cover
government
sales
in
the
first
place.
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
in
answer
to
the
question
which
was
asked
earlier
of
the
petitioner
that
hospitals
doing
the
dispensing
of
pharmaceuticals
and
the
giving
of
public
health
care
is
a
traditional
governmental
function.
the
district
court
here
so
found,
and
the
court
in
national
league
of
cities
so
held.
there
are
just
two
brief
points
that
i
want
to
make
quickly
that
are
discussed
in
the
brief.
one
is
that
the
state
has
argued
in
its
brief,
and
i
am
going
to
mention
the
point,
that
in
order
to
avoid
significant
questions
under
the
tenth
amendment,
that
the
court
should
construe
the
statute
so
as
not
to
apply
to
governmental
purchases.
the
other
is
that
in
view
of
the
almost
universally
recognized
inapplicability
of
the
statute
to
governmental
purchases
for
46
years,
if
the
court
should,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
basis,
but
if
the
court
should
decide
this
issue
of
first
impression,
then
there
should
not
be
a
retroactive
application
which
would
upset
not
only
the
states'
allocations,
cost
computations,
how
they
determine
what
programs
to
have,
what
prices
are
going
to
be
charged,
but
also
have
a
lot
of
treble
damage
liability
in
cases
both
against
states
and
against
the...
sorry,
strike
states,
buffer
against
the
manufacturers
of
drugs
in
this
particular
case,
but
the
manufacturers
of
every
single
product,
every
single
commodity
which
are
sold
to
state
and
governmental
agencies.
and
i
emphasize
again
in
conclusion
that
this
is
not
a
case
which
is
limited
to
drugs
or
hospitals.
this
is
a
very,
very
far-reaching
case
which
would
go
to
the
very
heart
of
everything
that
states
buy,
and
all
the
cost
allocations
which
states
have
made,
all
the
programs
which
they
have
in
place
which
are
based
upon
the
prices
which
they
have
been
able
to
get
at
lower
than
trade
levels
because
of
the
inapplicability
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes.
mr.
david
klingsberg
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
a
very
hot
issue.
it
has
been
in
the
press.
it
is
the
basis
on
which
bills
were
offered
to
congress
to
have
the
robinson-patman
act
coverage
extend
to
the
federal
government.
these
post
exchanges
do
not
merely
sell
to
military,
they
sell
to
diplomats
and
a
whole
host
of
other
people.
that
is
a
matter
for
congress.
mr.
david
klingsberg
but
that's
the
kind
of
issue
which,
like
the
sales
to
the
states
and
political
subdivisions,
we
suggest,
involves
so
many
far-reaching
political
and
economic
issues
that
that
should
be
considered
by
congress
and
has
been
considered
by
congress,
and
not
after
46
years
of
inapplicability
be
taken
up
and
altered
by
the
court
at
the
present
time.
thank
you.
