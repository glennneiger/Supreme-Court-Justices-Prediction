justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
the
chief
justice's
example,
there's
still
the
possibility
that
the
robinson-patman
act
might
not
apply
where
there
are
sales
to
a
government
entity
which
then
itself
engages
in
activity
that
is
competitive
with
private
business.
but
that
it
would
cover
just
sales
for
resale
by
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
aren't
just
buying
for
the
purpose
of
running
a
hospital.
justice
byron
r.
white
which...
the
hospital
would
be
competitive,
perhaps,
but
they
nevertheless
aren't...
here
they're
reselling.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
case
only
reaches
situations
where
the
resale
is
available
to
the
public
generally,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
think
it
would
reach
post
exchanges,
which
are
just
restricted
to
the
military.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
whoever
they're
restricted
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
the
robinson-patman
act
wouldn't
reach
that
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
instances
in
that
legislative
history
of
where
the
committee
reports
or
individual
congressmen
or
senators
addressed
expressly
the
sales
for
resale
matter?
i
know--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i've
read
your
briefs,
but
i
didn't
notice
you
ever
picked
out
a
particular
instance
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
have
been
in
a
hearing,
but
nothing
on
the
floor
or
in
any
committee
reports.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
you
think
the
limits
of
the
exemption
for
sales
to
churches
and
eleemosynary
institutions,
do
you
think...
an
exemption
for
purchases
that
have...
and
use
that
have
some
relation
to
their
function?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
want
to
talk
about
the
eleemosynary
institution.
take
a
private...
take
a
church.
take
a
church.
it
decides
that
to
make
a
little
money
we'll
go
into
the
book
business.
they
start
buying
books
very
cheaply
and
selling
them
very
cheaply.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
are
certainly
using
them
to
make
some
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
that
that
exemption
then
is
limited
to
own
use,
the
'38
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
you
wouldn't
include
within
own
use
resales.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
the
exemption
for
governmental
institutions,
which
you
say
was
pre-existent--
justice
byron
r.
white
--covers
resales
as
well
as
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes,
but
why
do
you...
but
you
yet
have
to
come
up
with
some
support
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
the
government
exemption
which
you
say
existed
from
the
very
start
covers
purchases
for
resale
as
well
as
just
purchases.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
i
still
want
you
to
find
me
some
express
mention
of
purchases
for
resale
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history,
where
somebody
gives
the
opinion
that
the
government
may
decide
to
go
into
competition
with
private
industry
and
purchase
goods
for
resale
and
direct
competition,
and
that
that
was
exempt.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
isn't
any,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
more
than
there
is
for
private
institutions.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
under
the
'38
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
it
is
pretty
hard
to
say
that
the
literal
words
of
the
statute
doesn't
cover
sales
to
government.
you
have
to
imply
some...
you
have
to
do...
you
have
to
construe
the
act
not
to
include
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
words
in
plain
black
and
white--
