rehnquist
did
the
chief
justice
say
the
cafeteria
was
maintained
chiefly
or
cheaply?
[laughter]
well,
my
next
question
was
going
to
be
what
if,
then,
the
evidence
showed
that
75
percent
of
the
customers
were
tourists
and
other
people
not
connected
with
this
building,
and
only
25
percent
were
people
in
the
building?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
klingsberg,
with
respect
to
the
instances
in
1951
and
1953
where
you
say
that
congress
rejected
efforts
to
amend
the
act,
were
there
bills
that
actually
were...
hearings
were
held
on
in
committee?
did
they
get
out
of
committee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
purpose
of
that
committee
report?
was
it
to
say
do
not
pass
or
do
pass
with
respect
to
a
particular
piece
of
legislation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
speaking,
strictly
speaking
of
an
exemption
in
the
same
sense
that
the
'38
act
conferred
an
exemption
on
eleemosynary
institutions,
or
are
you
speaking
simply
of
a
failure
to
include
within
the
act
in
the
first
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
argument
would
require
us
to
say
that
the
states
and
federal
government
were
subject
to
the
act
even
on
purchases
for
their
own
use,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
because
the
'38
act
just
doesn't
cover
the
government,
that
one
that
exempted
the
eleemosynary
institutions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
language
of
the
'38
act
lends
itself
to
that
construction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
language
of
the
'38
act
lends
itself
to
that
construction,
that
it
includes
the
government
as
an
eleemosynary
institution?
