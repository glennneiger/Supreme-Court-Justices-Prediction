we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
jefferson

pharmaceutical
against
abbott.
mr.

i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice

you
distinguish
it
on
the
grounds
that
that's
maintained
chiefly

the
convenience
of
personnel
working
in
the

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
within
context,
when--
--not
interested
in
the
law?
if
it
was
mr.
patman
who
said
it,
the
statement
that
was
mentioned
that
this
was
for
government
purchases,
is
it
not
implicit
in
that
kind
of
a
statement,
fairly
implicit
government
purchases
for
its
own
use?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
somewhat
post-legislative
history,
isn't
it?
chief
justice

e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.

chief
justice

e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
