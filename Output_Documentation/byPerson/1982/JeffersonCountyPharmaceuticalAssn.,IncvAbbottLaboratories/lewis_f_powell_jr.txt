justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down?
did
i
understand
you
to
say
at
the
outset
that
the
record
does
not
show
what
percentage
of
the
sales
by
these
pharmacies
went
to
the
public
generally?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
don't
have
any
record
other
than
the
pleadings,
do
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
decided
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
just
put
one
extreme
example?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
assume
that
the
post
exchanges
that
are
now
all
over
the
world
where
there
are
government
forces
stationed
were
proving
to
be
modestly
profitable,
and
the
government
decided
to
go
into
the
supermarket
business,
calling
them
post
exchanges,
and
opened
them
in
competition
with
the
chains
of
food
supermarket
stores
around
the
united
states,
so
that
you
had
a
safeway
and
a
giant
and
a
government
px,
all
open
to
the
public.
that
still,
under
your
analysis,
i
suppose,
would
be
exempt?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
do
not
sell
to
retired
reserve
officers.
i
know
that.

the
next
decision
that
i
have
to
bring
is
81-827,
jefferson
county
pharmaceutical
association
against
the
abbott
laboratories.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
sale
of
pharmaceutical
products
to
a
state
for
resale
and
competition
with
private
retail
pharmacies
is
exempt
from
the
principles
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
petitioner,
a
trade
association
of
retail
pharmacies
in
alabama,
filed
this
action.
respondent,
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
are
alleged
to
sell
their
products
to
the
state
at
prices
lower
than
those
charged
private
pharmacies.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
state
purchases,
whether
for
resale
or
not,
are
exempt
from
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
language
of
that
act
contains
no
such
exemption.
the
legislative
history
is
essentially
silent
on
the
question.
the
act
is
a
component
of
the
antitrust
laws.
our
case
has
repeatedly
have
held
that
a
strong
presumption
exist
against
the
implying
exemptions
for
such
laws.
moreover,
a
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
protect
small
retailers
from
the
ability
of
larger
organizations
to
obtain
discriminatory
prices.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
decision
below.
we
make
clear,
however,
that
our
holding
is
limited
to
sales
where
the
product
is
resold
by
the
state
or
by
a
state
agency
in
competition
with
private
retailers.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
o'connor
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan,
rehnquist,
and
stevens
have
joined.
