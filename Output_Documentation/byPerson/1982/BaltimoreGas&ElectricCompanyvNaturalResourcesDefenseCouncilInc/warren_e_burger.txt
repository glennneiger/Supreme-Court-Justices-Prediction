we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
baltimore
gas
and
electric
against
the
natural
resources
defense
council.
mr.
strauss,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
show
how
many
meteors
there
are
that
big
they
planned
around?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
they
do
not
have
any
record
of
the
most
recent
one?
[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
atkeson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
a
little
confused
as
perhaps
some
of
the
rest
of
us
are.
is
it
the
fact
of
a
risk
that
is
the
core
of
your
position,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
risk
which
is
undetermined,
cannot
be
identified,
cannot
be
measured?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
atkeson,
when
airlines
are
licensed
by
the
cab
or
when
they
are
built
by
airlines,
no
one
would
think
that
they
should
guarantee
that
no
airplane
would
never
fall
and
no
accident
would
ever
happen
and
no
injury
would
ever
follow.
no
one
think
that
that
should
be
done,
would
they
seriously?
and
yet
sometimes
200
or
300
people
are
killed
at
one
time
in
an
airplane
accident.
is
that
not
something
of
what
we
are
dealing
with
in
the
broad
picture
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
first
atomic
power
plant
goes
back
a
good
deal
more
than
seven
years,
though,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
first
atomic
power
plant
goes
back
considerably
more
than
seven
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
first
one
was
under
the
power
reactor
development
corporation
case
decided
by
this
court
almost
twenty
years
ago,
i
would
guess.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
strauss?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
