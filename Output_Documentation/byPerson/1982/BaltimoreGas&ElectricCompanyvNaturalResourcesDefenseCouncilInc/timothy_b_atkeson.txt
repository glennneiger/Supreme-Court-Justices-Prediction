mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
represent
respondent,
natural
resources
defense
council,
and
we
are
joined
by
a
respondent,
the
state
of
new
york,
and
by
15
other
states
and
several
citizens
groups
as
amicae.
the
issue
in
the
case
before
us
is
the
integrity
of
the
review
process
by
which
environmental
review
is
given
to
the
licensing
of
individual
nuclear
power
plants
under
the
national
environmental
policy
act.
mr.
strauss
has
identified
the
s-3
rulemaking
under
which
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
analyzed
the
impacts
of
the
nuclear
fuel
cycle
and
developed
the
s-3
table
which
is
attached
to
respondent
nrc's
brief.
if
the
court
would
care
to
examine
what
the
table
looks
like.
in
this
table
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
sets
out
what
is
deemed
to
be
the
environmental
impact
at
various
parts
of
the
nuclear
fuel
cycle,
and
if
the
court
would
look
down
towards
the
bottom
of
the
table
there
is
a
highlighted
item
referred
to
as
tru
and
hlw,
deep,
which
turns
out
to
be
transuranic
and
high-level
waste
deep,
and
it
is
followed
by
a
cryptic
number,
which
in
this
text
is
much
too
hard
to
read,
but
which
says
1.1
times
10
to
the
seventh.
when
this
is
multiplied
out
it
turns
about
to
be
11
million
curies,
by
far
the
highest
amount--
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
eleven
million
curies,
a
measurement
of
radioactivity.
eleven
million
curies,
by
far
the
highest
amount
of
radioactivity
represented
on
this
table.
in
other
words,
in
the
s-3
table
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
is
instructing
its
licensing
boards
that
this
immense
amount
of
radioactivity,
which
i
would
add
is
generated
for
each
nuclear
power
plant
per
year,
is
to
be
regarded
as
having
throughout
the
hundreds
and
thousands
of
years
of
its
intense
toxicity
zero
release
to
the
environment.
this
means
that
the
licensing
boards
which
must
conduct
the
environmental
review
of
nuclear
power
plants
are
being
instructed
that
for
all
practical
purposes
the
high-level
waste
disposal
problem
does
not
exist.
we
submit
that
in
the
context
of
this
case
what
the
government
is
arguing
is
that
an
agency
may
taken
an
environmental
problem
in
advance,
consider
it
generically
in
the
abstract,
and
then
for
policy
reasons
eliminate
it
from
consideration
in
subsequent
actual
decision
making
about
actual
nuclear
power
plants
by
setting
a
zero
value
on
it.
it
is
conceded
that
the
problems
of
the
disposal
of
high-level
waste
are
significant.
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
contend
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
that
it
as
a
decision-making
device
this
was
improper,
that
the
decision
making
involved
here
is
the
review
of
actual
nuclear
power
plants
and
that
the
rule,
if
it
had
been
made
correctly,
could
have
been
reviewed
and
applied
in
that
licensing.
but
since
the
court
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
decision
was
a
clear
error
of
judgment,
it
could
not
be
applied.
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
problem
here
is,
and
i
think
this
was
said
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
that
if
the
regulatory
commission
had
arrived
at
an
appropriate
decision
on
the
record
about
the
impact
of
high-level
waste
disposal,
i
think
the
decision
incorporates
the
thing
that--
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
--yes,
your
honor,
that
if
the
commission
had
correctly
decided
that
the
impact
of
high-level
waste
disposal
was
insignificant
then
that
could
have
bound
the
licensing
boards.
what
happened
here--
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
--your
honor,
the
fault
of
the
generic
approach
is
that
having
arrived
at
a
generic
review
of
the
problem,
the
commission
did
not
incorporate
that
generic
review
into
the--
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
--well,
the
problem
here
is
the
problem
that
the
generic
result
that
the
commission
actually
found
in
its
acknowledged
uncertainties
and
risks
associated
with
high-level
waste
disposal
were
then
not
factored
into
the
s-3
table.
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
justice
o'connor,
i
think
our
view
is
that
the
record
fulsome.
in
its
final
decision--
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
--well
actually,
justice
o'connor,
most
of
the
grounds
for
questioning
the
decision
of
the
nrc
here
are
in
statements
made
by
the
nrc
itself
or
endorsed
in
the
record.
the
commission
said,
we
agree
with
the
interagency
review
group
which
was
reporting
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
at
the
same
time
that
there
are
uncertainties
as
to
when
and
where
the
repositories
will
be
constructed
or
whether
they
will
perform
as
expected.
those
are
very
basic
uncertainties.
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
i
think
on
the
whole,
yes,
they
did.
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
justice
o'connor,
they
did
identify
all
the
major
areas
of
uncertainty.
what
is
involved,
though,
that
on
the
one
hand
they
would
say
we
concede
this,
we
concede
this,
we
concede,
but
for
policy
reasons
we
reach
this
conclusion.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
concessions
they
made
as
to
environmental
uncertainty
should
have
been
incorporated
in
table
s-3.
what
you
get
in
table
s-3
is
merely
the
cryptic
entry,
buried
at
federal
repository.
mr.
strauss
says
that
he
is
perfectly
prepared
to
have
some
supplementing
of
this
as
he
said
in
response
to
justice
steven's
question,
but
he
is
not
prepared
to
allow
the
licensing
boards
to
take
account
of
that
uncertainty
and
that
is
the
basic
problem
here.
the
national
environmental
policy
act--
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
--mr.
justice
stevens,
the
provision
of
the
statute
involved
is
the
provision
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
section
1022(c)
which
says
that
the
environmental
impact
of
the
end
action
is
to
be
set
out
in
the
environmental
impact
statement
and
is
to
accompany
the
proposal
through
the
agency
review
process.
in
this
case,
the
agency
review
process
starts
with
the
licensing
board.
it
is
the
licensing
board
that
is
the
only
entity
in
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
that
considers
the
environmental
impact
statement.
in
other
words,
if
this
issue
is
screened
off
from
consideration
by
the
nuclear
licensing
board,
then
nobody
considers
it
in
the
context
of
an
actual
power
plant
licensing.
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
as
the
lower--
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
--as
the
lower
court
pointed
out,
if
the
record
in
this
case
has
warranted
a
finding
that
there
was
zero
environmental
effect
then
the
commission
would
have
been
warranted
in
instructing
the
licensing
board
to
take
no
account.
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
we
are
saying
that
the
error
of
the
court
can
be
considered
in
one
way
or
the
other,
and
i
think
that
is
the
way
the
lower
court
put
it.
it
said
the
commission
has
made
either
a
mistake
of
judgment
in
assessing
the
impact
and
setting
it
out,
or
it
has
made
a
procedural
error
in
precluding
the
licensing
boards
from
considering
this
factor.
the
essence
of
the
problem
here
is
that
the
commission
conceded
the
uncertainties
and
risks.
it
then
screened
them
out
of
the
s-3
table
on
policy
grounds.
the
result
is
that
the
mandate
of
nepa
for
the
licensing
boards
to
consider
all
the
environmental
impacts
in
licensing
nuclear
power
plants
was
not
obeyed.
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
fact
is,
and
this
is
reflected
in
the
report
on
nuclear
regulatory
commission
procedures
that
in
all
instances
the
environmental
impact
statement
is
scrutinized
by
the
licensing
board.
that
is
the
only
comprehensive
review
of
the
environmental
impact
statements
that
takes
place.
it
could
be
changed,
but
it
has
not
been
changed.
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
a
great
deal
in
the
record
that
documents
the
risk.
there
is
the
risk
while
the
high-level
waste
is
on
the
surface
of
the
earth.
there
is
risk
attendant
on
its
being
taken
down
to
the
repository
if
a
repository
is
developed,
and
there
is
a
risk
documented
in
the
record
while
it
is
in
the
repository.
incidentally,
the
nuclear
waste
policy
act
passed
by
congress
at
the
end
of
the
last
year
provides
that
for
a
period
of
time
the
waste
is
to
be
retrievable
while
it
is
in
the
repository,
which
means
it
may
be
back
on
the
surface.
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
it
is
possible
that
the
commission
could
argue
that
since
it
has
authority
under
the
atomic
energy
act
to
license
or
not
license
a
nuclear
power
plant
that
it
could
adopt
such
a
rule
under
that
act,
but
it
would
seem
to
us
on
the
basis
of
the
record
in
this
case
that
it
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
it
to
say
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
as
they
are
here
that
those
facts
could
never
in
any
future
licensing
on
a
particular
actual
nuclear
power
plant
be
considered.
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
i
know
that
the
question
of
how
much
risk
is
acceptable
is
constantly
under
consideration
in
our
society,
and
i
know
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
rulemaking
was
to
quantify
the
risk
as
precisely
as
possible,
and
i
think
that
the
commission
has
done
a
tremendous
job
in
this
respect
in
the
seven
years
of
the
rulemaking.
but
what
is
left
at
the
end
is
that
the
commission
acknowledges
as
a
continuing
area
of
uncertainty
and
risk,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
incumbent
on
the
commission
to
set
that
out
candidly
in
the
s-3
table
and
if
it
is
set
out
there
at
an
appropriate
time
in
the
future
in
the
case
of
a
perhaps
marginal
plant
that
a
decision
is
made
not
to
go
forward
with
that.
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
excuse
me?
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
licensing
took
place
in
the
1950s.
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
yes,
at
the
outset
of
the
60s.
the
question
has
been
asked
what
level
of
risk
is
acceptable,
what
is
an
appropriate
response
to
the
requirement
of
nepa
that
risks
and
uncertainties
be
set
out
in
the
environmental
impact
statement.
i
think
i
heard
mr.
strauss
say
that
the
commission
at
this
point
is
satisfied
that
the
risk
is
not
such
as
to
preclude
further
licensing
of
nuclear
power
plants.
what
he
then
added
was
that
if
the
risk
is
deemed
to
be
at
some
other
point,
the
commission
might
make
the
decision
not
to
license
in
certain
cases
where
there
was
not
a
clear
need
for
power.
incidentally,
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
has
adopted
subsequent
to
the
s-3
rule
a
rule
that
the
class
nine
reactor
core
meltdown
accidents
be
considered
in
the
context
of
environmental
impact
statements.
so
in
response
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
are
engaged
in
the
activities
of
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
in
some
very
fine
assessments
of
what
degree
of
risk
is
acceptable
in
the
licensing
of
nuclear
power
plants,
and
those
issues,
as
i
say,
are
sent
out
to
the
licensing
boards
for
review.
we
have
drawn
the
court's
attention
to
the
problem
with
the
original
and
the
interim
rule
in
this
case
that
the
health,
socio-economic
and
cumulative
impacts
of
the
fuel
cycle
are
screened
from
review
as
those
original
and
interim
rules
were
phrased.
the
commission
acknowledged
this
deficiency
by
amending
the
table
s-3
rule
to
make
clear
that
these
health,
socio-economic
and
cumulative
impacts
could
be
considered.
it
is
clear
that
these
were
appropriate
to
be
considered
and
that
they
were
improperly
screened
from
review--
mr.
timothy
b.
atkeson
--mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
matter
was
drawn
to
the
attention
of
the
commission
at
the
time
of
the
interim
rulemaking,
and
it
was
not
for
two
years
that
the
commission
got
around
to
amending
the
thing.
so
the
matter
was
being
litigated
before
the
commission
for
some
time
before
the
amendment
took
place.
this
case
is
not
about
the
propriety
of
generic
rulemaking,
nor
about
the
wisdom
of
building
nuclear
power
plants
in
the
face
of
uncertainty
regarding
nuclear
waste
disposal.
essentially,
it
is
a
case
about
the
commission's
prolonged
attempted
to
isolate
the
problems
of
nuclear
waste
disposal
from
the
problem
of
deciding
whether
it
is
worth
it
in
any
particular
instance
to
license
a
plant
that
will
create
substantial
amounts
of
additional
waste.
nothing
in
the
vermont
yankee
decision
of
this
court
which
was
explicit
in
its
recognition
of
the
problems
of
high-level
waste
disposal
suggests
that
an
agency
has
discretion
under
nepa
to
exclude
significant
environmental
uncertainties
and
risks
from
the
nepa
decision-making
process
when
it
comes
to
licensing
particular
nuclear
plants.
the
law
requires
disclosure
of
these
uncertainties,
and
the
commission
inexplicably
refused
to
do
so
despite
its
recognition
of
their
significant
nature.
the
issue
here
which
congress
had
made
all
the
more
important
by
its
heavy
reliance
in
the
nuclear
waste
policy
act
on
use
of
nepa
analysis
is
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
nepa
process
based
on
clear,
candid
disclosure
and
consideration
of
the
significant
environmental
risks
of
creating
high-level
waste
in
the
licensing
of
particular
nuclear
power
plants.
for
the
reason
stated
today
and
as
summarized
in
our
brief,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
