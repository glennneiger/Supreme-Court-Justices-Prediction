justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
strauss,
my
feeling
about
reading
the
briefs
was
that
it
was
very
much
like
two
ships
passing
in
the
night,
that
apparently
each
party
wanted
to
follow
its
own
line
of
analysis
and
there
wasn't
too
much
interaction
between
them.
what
exactly
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
wrong
in
saying
that
nepa
could
make
this...
that
nrc
couldn't
make
this
a
generic
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
understand
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
had
any
broader
rationale,
perhaps
i
should
say
more
precise
rationale,
than
just
the
generalized
provisions
of
nepa?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
in
so
many
words?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
understanding,
mr.
strauss,
that
in
these
individual
licensing
proceedings
it
is
a
hearing
in
which
people
may
be
heard,
i
take
it,
in
opposition
to
licensing,
that
one
is
permitted
to
argue
that
this
established
amount
of
uncertainty
is
a
reason
for
not
granting
the
license.
there
is
nothing
in
the
commission's
policy
that
would
prevent
that,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
cannot
relitigate,
so
to
speak,
the
values
in
the
table,
but
you
can
argue
that
the
established
figures
in
the
table
show
sufficient
uncertainty
that
this
particular
plant
ought
not
to
be
licensed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
to
me
is
a
ground
that
i
urge
upon
you
for
not
granting
the
license.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
wastes
other
than
the
solid
wastes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
and
one
could
still
argue
for
the
licensing
board
the
worst
case
hypothesis
that
however
unlikely
it
is
to
occur
it
is
still
a
reason
not
to
license?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
atkeson,
do
you
support
the
court
of
appeals
reasoning
for
deciding
that
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
ought
not
to
have
done
this
on
a
generic
basis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
it
about
nepa
that
prevents
a
generic
approach
like
this?
what
is
it
in
the
language?
i
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
with
some
care,
and
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
mr.
strauss
that
the
principle
opinion
never
points
to
any
section
of
the
act.
it
just
refers
to
nepa>
["].
what
section
of
the
act
do
you
rely
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
understand
my
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
asked
you
what
section
of
nepa
you
were
relying
on
to
fault
the
generic
approach
of
the
nrc.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
from
your
answer
you
are
simply
unable
to
cite
any
section
of
nepa
that
supports
the
result
you
are
urging.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
not
a
mandate
to
all
licensing
boards.
that
is
a
mandate
to
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission,
is
it
not,
that
presumably
can
be
allotted
to
is
subordinate
bodies
within
reason
as
the
nrc
sees
fit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
anyone
ever
try
to
have
them
considered,
mr.
atkeson?
i
had
the
impression
at
least
as
to
the
health
effects
no
one
ever
asked
to
have
them
considered.
