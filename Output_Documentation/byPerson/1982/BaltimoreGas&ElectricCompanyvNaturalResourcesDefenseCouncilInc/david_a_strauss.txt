mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
adequately
considered
the
impact
that
disposing
of
the
spent
fuel
from
nuclear
power
plants
will
have
on
the
environment.
in
1972,
the
commission
began
an
informal
rulemaking
proceeding
to
consider
this
and
other
associated
environmental
impacts
and
the
effect
they
should
have
on
applications
for
licenses
to
build
or
operate
nuclear
reactors.
seven
years
later
the
commission
adopted
the
final
version
of
the
rule
that
is
at
issue
here.
in
the
interim
the
commission
had
conducted
two
extensive
staff
studies,
three
informal
rulemaking
proceedings
in
which
literally
thousands
of
pages
of
comments
were
exchanged,
and
a
total
of
over
two
weeks
of
hearings.
the
rule
itself
went
through
four
versions
that
differed
in
detail.
the
rule
specifies
in
a
table
the
amount
of
radioactivity
that
will
be
released
to
the
environment
in
the
course
of
disposing
of
various
kinds
of
nuclear
wastes,
and
it
provides
that
this
table
is
to
be
included
in
the
environmental
impact
statements
that
are
prepared
in
connection
with
each
individual
reactor
license.
the
licensing
boards
that
consider
individual
applications
are
then
not
to
receive
additional
evidence
on
the
amount
of
radiation
released.
the
reason
for
precluding
the
boards
from
reconsidering
the
radiation
releases
in
individual
cases
is
that
these
releases
are
entirely
generic,
that
is
to
say
they
are
always
the
same
for
a
reactor
of
a
given
size
no
matter
where
or
when
the
reactor
is
built.
many
aspects
of
this
rule
are
not
at
issue
here.
for
example,
the
commission
made
the
very
pessimistic
assumption
that
all
of
the
radioactive
gases
would
escape
from
the
wastes,
and
it
listed
in
the
table
the
resulting
amounts
of
radioactivity
that
would
be
released.
the
aspect
of
the
rule
that
is
at
issue
here
concerns
high-level
solid
wastes,
many
of
which
remain
radioactive
for
thousands
of
years.
the
commission's
conclusion
reflected
in
the
rule
is
that
these
wastes
can
be
buried
in
a
certain
geologic
formation
of
a
kind
that
is
found
in
24
of
the
50
states
in
such
a
way
that
they
will
not
release
a
significant
amount
of
radiation
to
the
environment.
the
commission
studied
a
number
of
events,
natural
or
man-made
that
might
cause
radiation
to
escape
from
such
a
repository.
for
example,
the
commission
concluded
that
a
direct
hit
by
a
meteorite
a
mile
and
a
quarter
in
diameter
would
release
radiation
sufficient
to
contaminate
the
area
within
roughly
an
11-mile
radius
of
the
repository.
but
such
a
meteorite--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
the
record
shows
that
such
a
meteorite
hit
could
be
expected
on
the
average
once
every
ten
trillion
years.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
an
earthquake
fault,
the
commission
estimated,
would
occur
at
a
typical
site
every
25
billion
years.
a
more
likely
although
still
unlikely
occurrence
is
that
ground
water
would
penetrate
the
repository,
but
ground
water
usually
moves
very
slowly
and
the
commission
calculated
that
by
the
time
the
radioactive
materials
in
the
groundwater
reached
the
surface
they
would
be
so
diluted
and
they
would
have
decayed
to
such
a
degree
that
a
person
receiving
the
maximum
exposure
to
that
ground
water
would
be
subject
to
radiation
roughly
equal
to
the
background
radiation
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
soil.
the
commission
accordingly
concluded
that
so
far
as
science
could
determine
the
chances
of
a
substantial
release
of
radiation
from
the
repository
are
minimal
to
the
point
of
being
banishing,
and
the
more
likely
occurrences
would
not
release
significant
amounts
of
radiation.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
question
that
conclusion.
at
the
same
time
the
commission
acknowledged
explicitly
and,
in
fact,
repeatedly
that
there
is,
of
course,
a
certain
irreducible
and
imponderable
uncertainty
involved
in
predicting
what
will
happen
so
far
into
the
future
and
in
making
predictions
about
a
repository
site
that
has
not
yet
been
specifically
designated.
but
the
commission
concluded
that
although
these
uncertainties
exist,
a
reasonable
working
assumption
that
the
licensing
boards
are
to
use
is
that
there
will
be
no
releases
of
radiation
from
the
solid
wastes
once
the
repository
has
been
sealed.
the
court
of
appeals
had
invalidated
an
earlier
version
of
the
rule
on
the
ground
that
the
commission
did
not
follow
sufficiently
elaborate
procedures
in
assessing
the
impacts
of
nuclear
wastes.
this
court
reversed.
on
remand,
the
court
of
appeals,
now
working
with
a
rulemaking
record
that
had
been
greatly
supplemented
by
the
commission,
invalidated
all
versions
of
the
rule
on
the
ground
that
the
commission
violated
the
national
environmental
policy
act
when
it
determined
not
to
allow
licensing
boards
to
reconsider
in
individual
proceedings
the
uncertainties
associated
with
the
disposal
of
high-level
wastes.
we
then
sought
certiorari.
although
the
court
of
appeals
based
its
decision
squarely
on
nepa,
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
it
never
identified
the
language
in
nepa
or
in
any
decision
of
this
court
that
prohibits
the
commission
from
doing
what
it
did
here.
as
this
court
has
said
several
times,
what
nepa
requires
is
that
an
agency
consider
the
environmental
consequences
of
its
actions
and
ordinarily
disclose
them
to
the
public.
the
commission
did
consider
the
uncertainties
associated
with
high-level
waste
disposal,
and
it
made
those
uncertainties
fully
explicit.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
suggest
otherwise.
on
the
contrary,
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondents
quote
at
some
length
from
the
commission's
own
statements
in
attempting
to
show
what
we
freely
concede,
that
there
are
inevitably
uncertainties
associated
with
an
inquiry
of
this
sort,
nor
was
the
commission's
consideration
of
these
issues
not
meaningful
or
only
abstract
as
the
court
of
appeals
suggested.
for
several
years
the
commission
has
been
on
record
as
saying
that
it
would
not
continue
to
license
reactors
at
all
if
it
did
not
have
reasonable
assurance
that
wastes
could
be
disposed
of
safely.
if
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
commission's
investigation
of
the
waste
disposal
problem
had
been
that
the
risks
associated
with
any
category
of
wastes
are
unacceptably
great
or
if
that
is
ever
the
outcome
because
the
commission's
investigation
of
this
matter
is
continuing,
the
commission
would
halt
all
reactor
licensing.
if
the
commission
were
to
conclude
that
the
risks
associated
with
waste
disposal,
while
not
that
severe,
are
still
grave
it
would
be
open
to
it
to
decide,
for
example,
to
permit
reactors
to
be
built
or
operated
only
where
the
need
for
power
is
particularly
exigent.
but
the
commission
concluded
instead
that
the
ascertainable
risks
are
minimal,
and
as
i
said
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
question
that
conclusion
on
this
rulemaking
record
and
that
the
unavoidable
uncertainties
should
not
affect
the
rate
at
which
reactors
are
licensed.
since
that
conclusion
was
reached
after
thorough,
explicit
and
candid
consideration,
it
simply
cannot
violate
nepa.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
nepa
for
a
requirement
that
is
simply
not
found
in
nepa.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
don't,
justice
rehnquist.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
nepa
to
a
great
extent.
it
also
nominally
said
that
the
commission's
action
violated
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard,
but
every
time
it
said
that
it
right
away
said
and
we
find
the
standards
to
inform
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
rule
in
nepa.
i
think
what
is
going
on
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
and
in
respondent's
brief
as
well
is,
because
they
do
not
object
to
the
thoroughness
or
the
candor
of
the
commission's
discussions
which
is
the
stuff
of
nepa.
what
they
seem
to
be
doing
is
operating
with
an
assumption
that
nepa
requires
that
environmental
impacts
not
only
be
considered
by
the
commission
itself
but
be
considered
and
reconsidered
and
perhaps
relitigated
at
every
subsequent
stage
of
the
agency's
decision-making
process
where
it
might
possibly
affect
a
subordinate
official's
decision.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
it
did
not
say
that
in
so
many
words.
it
used
phrases
like
the
nepa
decision-making
process,
a
phrase
respondents
use
as
well.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
environmental
impact
statement
at
each
licensing
stage,
at
both
the
construction
license
and
the
operating
license
stage,
incorporate--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--table
s-3
and
the
references
it
incorporates
which--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--in
table
s-3
and
the
references
it
makes
incorporating--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
that
is
a
possible
legal
question.
that
is
not
the
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
asserted.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
could
be
a
potential
challenge
raised
to
this
rule
or
certainly
to
a
subsequent
environmental
impact
statement,
but
the
standards
for
incorporation
by
reference
in
environmental
impact
statements
are
necessarily
flexible.
there
is
really
no
point
in
sort
of
trying
to
come
up
with
a
capsule
phrasing
of
these
uncertainties
instead
of
referring
people
to
the
fuller
discussions.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
rule
does
not
require
any
summary
to
be
attached.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
my
understanding
is
that
the
eiss
in
individual
cases
are
prepared
in
accordance
with
commission
regulations
and
there
would
now
not
be
any
specific
regulation
telling
the
staff
to
summarize--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
do
not
know
of
anything
specifically
prohibiting
them
from
doing
it
if
they
did
it
off
their
own
bat,
as
it
were.
i
think
it
is
worth
trying
to
think
about
what
advantage
would
be
gained
by
trying
to
summarize
these
uncertainties.
i
do
not
know
that
a
summary
could
say
any
more
than
what
i
just
said.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
think
that
is
right.
the
table
s-3
came
with
a
statement
of
consideration.
the
statement
of--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
there
were
cross
references
in
quotations,
but
i
think
that
accompanying
statement
lays
it
out
quite
clearly,
about
as
clearly
as
i
have
laid
it
out
to
the
court
that
there
are
uncertainties
associated
here.
that
is
the
language
that
the
court
of
appeals
quoted
from
at
such
length.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right,
but
that,
i
think,
there
are
two
points
to
be
made
about
that.
the
ceq
guidelines
that
were
in
effect
at
the
time
this
council
of
environmental
quality
got
them
as
they
were
in
effect
at
the
time
the
rule
was
issued
specifically
envision
incorporation
by
reference
of
other
documents.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
they
are
flexible.
they
do
not
specify
the
extent,
and
it
is
just
pointless
to
a
large
extent
to
require
the
documents
be
attached
to
an
environmental
impact
statement
instead
of
simply
saying
if
you
are
interested
in
this
problem
further
the
nrc--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
i
doubt
very
much
that
anyone
who
is
interested
in
this
problem
would
not
know
what
to
do
when
he
looked
at
that
table
s-3.
i
think
actually,
justice
stevens,
you
brought
out
another
point
about
what
the
commission
has
done
here
as
opposed
to
what
respondents
and
apparently
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
them
do.
the
commission
has
made
a
very
clear
and
visible
and
public
focused
decision
on
a
matter
of
no
small
importance,
the
question
whether
reactor
licensing
is
to
continue
at
the
same
pace
despite
these
imponderable
and
irreducible
uncertainties.
the
commission
made
its
decision,
made
it
visibly,
and
that
is
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
that
nepa
is
supposed
to
encourage.
the
respondent's
solution
would
have
the
effect
of
scattering
the
decision
on
this
question
among
a
multitude
of
very
low
visibility
decisions
made
by
licensing
boards
in
particular
cases,
decisions
that
because
these
uncertainties
are
really
inherently
unquantifiable
would
necessarily
be
kind
of
inscrutable,
and
it
cannot
be
the
case
that
nepa
requires
a
less
visible
decision
that
members
of
the
public
would
have
a
more
difficult
time
appreciating
than
what
the
commission
did
here.
i
should
say
that
we
are
not
suggesting
that
there
are
no
limits
at
all
on
an
agency's
ability
to
organize
its
internal
affairs
and
to
allocate
decision-making
responsibility
between
the
agency
itself
and
its
subordinate
bodies,
but
the
question
is
one
of
the
overall
reasonableness
of
what
the
agency
has
done.
it
is
not
a
specific
inflexible
mandate
from
nepa,
and
i
think
in
order
to
best
understand
the
reasonableness
of
what
the
commission
did
here,
reasonableness
deriving
from
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test,
the
best
way
to
understand
it
is
to
think
about
what
the
alternatives
might
have
been
in
as
concrete
terms
as
possible.
respondents
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
somewhat
vague
on
this
and
understandably
so.
for
example,
it
appears
that
they
would
want
the
licensing
board
to
reconsider
these
uncertainties
in
a
somewhat
plenary
fashion.
they
would
want
to
be
able
to
try
to
explain
to
the
licensing
boards
that
these
uncertainties
should
persuade
them
not
to
license
a
particular
reactor.
well,
it
is
easy
to
see
how
that
could
quickly
turn
each
licensing
proceeding
into
a
rerun
of
this
monumental
rulemaking.
these
issues
are
very
complex,
very
technologically
difficult.
the
scientific
learning
on
them
is
found
in
many
sources,
and
many
arguments
and
considerations
could
be
brought
to
bear
if
this
question,
to
what
extent
should
these
uncertainties
affect
the
decision
to
license
a
reactor,
if
that
question
were
tossed
open
in
individual
licensing
proceedings.
if
that
question
were
not
tossed
open,
if
as
respondents
sometime
seem
to
suggest
the
licensing
boards
are
just
supposed
to
be
given
a
little
package
that
will
explain
to
them
exactly
what
these
uncertainties
are
and
this
package
is
somehow
to
be
inserted
in
the
ledger
that
licensing
boards
are
thought
to
draw
up,
if
that
and
no
further
inquiry
at
the
licensing
board
stage
is
to
be
permitted,
if
that
is
what
respondents
have
in
mind,
then
you
have
to
wonder
just
what
will
be
accomplished
by
that.
the
package
is
unlikely
to
give
them
any
better
sense
of
the
uncertainties
than
what
i
have
said
to
the
court,
as
i
said,
justice
stevens,
or
than
what
the
commission
has
said,
and
the
result
would
be
that
a
licensing
board
would
engage
in
the
process
of
balancing
these
unquantifiable,
imponderable
uncertainties
against
such
things
as
the
need
for
nuclear
power.
the
commission
could--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
it
would
be...
the
values
that
are
established
in
the
table
can
be
argued
about.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
values
in
the
table
reflect
such
uncertainties
that
exist
usually
by,
as
i
said
in
the
case
of
the
gases,
by
saying
we
will
assume
everything
is
released
simply
by
assuming
the
worst
case
and
to
that
extent
they
already
have
taken
into
account
the
uncertainties,
and
you
would
be
entitled
to
say,
look,
licensing
this
will
cause
the
release
of
so
many
curies
of
such
and
such
a
gas
and
that
will
have
damaging
effects
on
health
and--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
is
right.
you
would
be
able
to
make
that
argument.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
values
in
the
table
are
to
be
taken--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
working
assumption,
that
is
right,
is
that
solid
waste--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--you
would
not
be
able
to
argue.
the
commission
has
decided
that
the
assumption
is
to
be
that
solid
wastes
will
not
release--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--radioactivity
in
the
environment.
you
would
not
be
able
to--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
is
right,
that
ruling,
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
oh,
no.
what
you
have
to
assume
there
is
that
the
values
reflected
in
the
table
accurately
reflect
how
much
radioactivity
will
be
released.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
worst
case
hypothesis
is
built
right
into
the
table.
the
commission
in
the
case
of
these
gases
has
already
done
it,
and
you
would
be
able
without
even
arguing
that
the
licensing
board
should
adopt
the
worst
case
hypothesis
say
our
working
assumption
is
that
all
the
gases
will
be
released.
this
will
have
a
severe
health
affect.
you
could
argue
that.
i
mean,
in
fact,
i
think
the
commission
has
said
this,
although
it
has
not
bound
the
licensing
boards
to
it.
in
fact,
these
gaseous
releases
are
not
large
enough
to
have
a
major
health
affect,
but
in
the
current
state
of
affairs
you
could
argue
otherwise
to
a
licensing
board.
i
will
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
some
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
