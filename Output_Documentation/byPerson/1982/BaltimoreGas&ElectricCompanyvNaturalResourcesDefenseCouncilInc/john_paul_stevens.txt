justice
john
paul
stevens
perhaps
my
questions
would
be
better
addressed
to
them.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
since
you
have
been
interrupted?
would
you
agree
that
the
nepa
requires
the
preparation
of
an
environmental
impact
statement
at
some
stage
in
the
proceedings
which
discloses
in
a
meaningful
way
that
there
is
some
uncertainty
about
the
permanent
storage
of
nuclear
wastes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
where
will
that
disclosure
be
made
in
the
environmental
impact
statements
that
may
be
made
consistently
with
the
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
table
s-3?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
that
mean
that
the
disclosure
we
are
talking
about
then,
in
future
environmental
impact
statements
is
that
which
we
can
find
in
table
s-3?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
isn't
the
legal
question
whether
the
incorporation
by
reference
of
all
these
other
documents
is
an
adequate
compliance
with
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
don't
we
have
to
be
satisfied
on
that
in
order
to
be
sure
that
the
statute
has
been
complied
with?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
opponent
ends
his
brief
by
saying
that
all
that
has
to
be
done
is
to
attach
a
rather
short
summary
that
there
are,
in
fact,
some
risks
associated
with
this.
do
you
understand
that
the
rule
would
preclude
such
a
summary
from
being
attached
to
individual
environmental
impact
statements
that
may
be
made
with
respect
to
particular
licensing
applications?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is
does
it
forbid
it.
it
forbids
the
individual
decision
to
reexamine
the
basic
problem,
as
i
understand
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
does
it
also
forbid
the
eis
that
is
issued
in
connection
with
a
particular
license
application
from
including
a
short
summary
saying
well,
the
table
s-3
should
be
understood
to
reflect
certain
risks
associated
with
the
long-term
storage
of
wastes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
there
is
nothing
telling
them
to
do
it.
i
am
asking
if
there
is
anything
prohibiting
them
from
doing
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
thing
is
that
what
you
have
just
said
is
a
lot
plainer
to
the
ordinary
layman
than
ever
what
one
would
get
out
of
reading
table
s-3
if
he
was
not
as
well
informed
as
you
are.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
a
lot
of
cross
references.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
that
is
something
you
have
to
go
to
another
document
to
find.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
this
extent?
do
you
think
to
this
extent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
not
even
say
that.
that
is
the
point.
you
do
not
even
say
if
you
are
interested
in
this
problem
further
this
is
what
you
will
find.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
strauss,
is
that
a
fair
portrayal
of
the
portion
of
s-3
that
relates
to
long-term
storage
of
waste?
as
i
understood
the
order,
the
licensing
boards
are
told
not
to
base
any
decision
on
this
at
all,
that
that
has
been
decided
on
a
generic
basis
which
in
turn
would
mean
that
there
would
be
no
purpose
in
an
individual
opponent
of
a
licensing
application
rearguing
this
point.
i
think
this
in
effect
is
like
a
pre-trial
order
saying
this
issue
has
been
decided.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
one
of
the
values
in
the
table
is
you
shall
not
consider
the
risk
of
release
from
permanent
storage.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
answer
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
is
that
argument
would
not
be
open
in
an
individual
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
point
is
that
you
have
made
that
ruling
on
a
generic
basis,
and
it
is
to
be
excluded
from
the
individual
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
strauss,
let
me
just
interrupt
if
i
may.
i
know
justice
rehnquist
tried,
and
i
would
like
to
try
again.
what
provision
of
what
statute
do
you
rely
on
to
say
they
had
the
duty
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
by
that
argument
then
suggest
that
it
would
never
be
permissible
to
have
a
generic
rule
excluding
any
issue
from
individual
consideration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
issue
affecting
the
environment,
that
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
say
that
then
you
are
objecting
to
the
substance
of
the
decision
rather
than
to
the
procedure?
