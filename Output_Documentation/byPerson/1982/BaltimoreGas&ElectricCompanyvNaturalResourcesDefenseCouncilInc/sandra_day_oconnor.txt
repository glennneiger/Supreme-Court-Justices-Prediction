it
did
consider,
in
other
words,
the
evidence
that
was
available.
you
disagree
with
its
conclusion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
it
did
consider,
in
your
view,
the
relevant
evidence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
it
also
adequately
describe
the
environmental
questions
surrounding
the
back

o'connor
mr.
atkeson,
in
your
view
could
an
individual
licensing
agency
adopt
a
generic
rule
to
the
effect
that
the
long-term
storage
of
waste
would
have
no
likely
effect
on
the
environment?
