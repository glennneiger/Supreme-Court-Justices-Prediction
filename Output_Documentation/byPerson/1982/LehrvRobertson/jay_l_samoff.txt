mr.
jay
l.
samoff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
throughout
this
argument,
i
respectfully
request
that
the
court
bear
three
things
in
mind:
one
is
that
we
do
not
and
have
not
conceded
that
the
appellant
is
in
fact
the
father
of
the
child.
secondly,
that
this
is
a
quilloin
type
adoption,
a
stepfather
adoption,
a
stepfather
who
was
adopting
his
wife's
child.
and
since
there--
and
the
third
point
is
that
the
appellant
never
had
and
never
sought
custody
of
the
child,
which
meant
that
regardless
of
what
the
appellant
said
in
any
court
anywhere
that
child
was
going
to
continue
to
live
in
the
mother's
household
and
was
going
to
continue
to
be
the
de
facto
child
of
the
stepfather.
and
this
is
what
judge
elwyn
was
faced
with
in
family
court.
i
wish
to
point
out
a
factual
inaccuracy
in
appellant's
argument--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--he
would
have
gotten
notice.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
to
provide
testimony
regarding
the
child's
best
interests.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
i
didn't
say
it
had
to
go
through
anyway.
what
i
did
say--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--no,
i
think
the
sequence
of
events
is
extremely
important
here.
what
we
have
is
an
adoption
hearing
that
was
held,
conducted
and
finalized,
finalized
with
the
exception
of
the
ministerial
act
of
signing
the
order,
on
january
the
15th,
1979.
the
appellant
did
not
commence
his
paternity
petition...
he
did
not
file
it
in
the
westchester
county
family
court
until
january
31st,
and
it
gave
no
notice
to
anybody
until
the
westchester
county
family
court
served
by
mail
a
summons
with
the
petition
in
late
february.
so
that
it
is
not
correct
to
say--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--that
happened
in
late
february.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
that
order
to
show
cause
was
requested
by
myself,
and
it
was
strictly
a
motion
to
change
the
venue
of
the
westchester
county
proceeding
to
ulster
county.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
i
didn't
want
to
play
in
his
ballpark,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
i
did
not
move
to
have
the
proceedings--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--i
would
have
moved...
i
would
have
done
the
same
thing
that
i
in
fact
did
in
westchester.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
i
didn't
ignore
him,
your
honor.
i
moved
to
dismiss
his
petition,
and
in
fact
it
was--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--i
would
have
done
the
same
thing.
it
was
merely
a
motion
to
change
venue,
not
to
consolidate
the
proceedings.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
no.
that
would
be
discretionary.
that's
the
safety
valve
here.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
hour
and
a
half,
hour
and
45
minutes.
it
was
merely
a
convenience
motion
for
myself
and
for
any
witnesses
i
might
have
to
bring.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
the
statute
didn't
provide
for
it.
bear
in
mind--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--we
don't--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--yes,
your
honor.
well,
we
don't
admit
that
he's
the
father.
that's
the
first
thing.
and
to
give
notice
to
somebody
who
had
not
asserted
rights
under
the
statute
would
be
to
give
rights
to
somebody
who
is
not
necessarily
entitled
to
them.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
we
did
not
state
one
way
or
another
whether
he
is
the
father.
we
did
not
say
he's
not
the
father.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
statutory
protection
in
the
paternity
proceeding
where--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--intermittently,
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
yes.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
we
certainly--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--the
child...
they
did
not
live
together
from
the
time
she
went
to
the
hospital
to
have
the
child
and
thereafter.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
they
did
not
resume
living
together
thereafter.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
i
don't
know
it,
and
the
reason,
your
honor,
i
don't
know--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--the
reason
i
don't
know
precisely,
your
honor,
is
it
is
true
that
they
lived
together
over
a
two
or
two
and
a
half
year
period
prior
to
the
birth
of
the
child,
but
it
was
not
continuous.
there
were
breaks
in
this
living
arrangement
where
one
would
move
out
and
move
back.
what
we
had
was
a
situation
where
this
is
a
claimant
to
paternity
who
never
provided
support,
who
never
visited
except
on
a
few
occasions
in
1977,
and
then
he
states
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
30
and
31,
he
admits
that
he
knew
precisely
where
they
were
as
early
as
august
1978...
it's
right
there
in
his
own
affidavit...
and
that
he
took
no
steps,
did
absolutely
nothing
to
exhibit
an
interest
until
his
attorney
writes
a
letter,
i
think
in
december,
saying
we
want
visitation
with
your
child.
he
doesn't
even
claim
that
it's
his
own
child.
he
then
does
not
put
his
name
on
the
putative
father
registry,
despite
the
fact
that
he
is
represented
by
counsel.
he
did
nothing
at
this
point,
and
in
january,
at
the
very
end
of
january
for
the
very
first
time,
after
we
have
conducted
the
hearing
he
files
his
petition
in
westchester.
thereafter,
a
full
month
later
goes
by
before
we
even
have
notice
about
it.
and
as
an
officer
of
the
court
i
immediately
went
to
judge
elwyn
and
told
him.
i
also
told
westchester.
and
the
situation
at
this
point
was,
what
was
judge
elwyn
faced
with?
now,
bear
in
mind
caban
had
not
been
determined
at
this
point,
which
meant
that,
assuming
arguendo
he
was
the
father,
the
sole
interest
that
this
man
had
was
to
provide
evidence
as
to
what's
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
now,
judge
elwyn
had:
one,
conducted
a
hearing
in
which
he
took
testimony;
two,
he
had
had
a
social
services
report
which
indicated
that
certainly
it
was
in
the
child's
best
interests;
and
three
and
most
damningly
is,
in
the
westchester
county
paternity
petition
he
specifically
stated
that
he
only
wanted
visitation.
he
was
virtually
conceding
the
propriety
of
the
mother's
home.
well,
judge
elwyn
had
a
discretionary
right
to
reopen
the
whole
thing.
by
the
way,
there
was
no
application
to
do
so
at
this
point.
it
was
all
vague
and
up
in
the
air.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so,
because--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--well,
i
think
that
the
judge...
that
there
was
at
least
a
four
or
five
day
hiatus
where
action
could
have
been
taken,
where
a
telephone
call
at
that
point
might
have
been
made.
but
in
any
and
all
events,
judge
elwyn
determined,
and
looking
at
quilloin
and
the
quote
in
quilloin:
"we
have
little
doubt
that
the
due
process
clause
would
be
offended
if
a
state
were
to
attempt
to
force
the
breakup
of
a
natural
family
over
the
objections
of
the
parents
and
their
children,
without
some
showing
of
unfitness,
for
the
sole
reason
that
to
do
so
was
thought
to
be
in
the
child's
best
interest.
"
"but
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
unwed
father
at
any
time
had
or
sought
actual
or
legal
custody
of
his
child.
"
"nor
is
this
a
case
in
which
the
proposed
adoption
would
place
the
child
with
a
new
set
of
parents
with
whom
the
child
had
never
before
lived.
"
"rather,
the
result
of
the
adoption
in
this
case
is
to
give
full
recognition
to
a
family
unit
already
in
existence,
a
result
desired
by
all
concerned
except
appellant.
"
"whatever
might
be
required
in
other
situations,
we
cannot
say
that
the
state
was
required
in
this
situation
to
find
anything
more
than
that
the
adoption,
and
denial
of
legitimation,
were
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
"
now,
there
was
a
safety
valve
here.
this
wasn't
necessarily
the
end
of
it.
there
were
two
safety
valves:
one,
new
york
law
provides
that
he
could
have
moved
to
intervene
even
after
the
signing
of
the
order.
no
motion
was
made.
he
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
abandoned
the
appeal.
it
was
dismissed
by
operation
of
law.
if
he's
contending
that
that
is
an
intervention,
then
it's
res
judicata;
the
case
is
decided.
now,
what
is
the
other
safety
valve?
and
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
noted.
there
is
a
section
114
of
the
domestic
relations
law,
which
says
that
for
good
cause
shown
an
application
can
be
made
to
the
court
showing
why
the
adoption
should
not
be
set
aside.
this
was
there.
this
was
known
to
judge
elwyn.
he
said,
if
this
man
wants
to
participate
he
can
make
his
application
in
a
timely
and
orderly
fashion.
he
had
nothing
before
him.
the
hearing
had
already
been
conducted
before
judge
elwyn
knew
of
his
existence.
a
114
application
in
fact
was
made,
and
at
that
time
he
had
an
opportunity
to
lay
bare
his
soul.
he
didn't
have
to
prove
his
case.
all
he
had
to
do
is
make
his
allegations,
lay
out
a
prima
facie
case
as
to
why
he
thought
the
adoption
should
not
go
through
and
why
it
was
not
in
the
child's
best
interests.
bear
in
mind
that
the
scope
of
his
participation
prior
to
caban
was
strictly
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
and
he
in
fact
does
lay
bare
his
soul,
and
every
court
below
found
that
he
had
not
even
touched
on
the
subject
of
best
interests,
that
in
fact
if
every
single
solitary
thing
he
said
was
true
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
that
it
was
not
in
the
child's
best
interests.
so
not
having
even
made
out
a
prima
facie
case,
there
was
no
point
even
for
a
hearing
at
that
point.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
yes.
he
goes
through
the
entire
history
of
how
the
appellee
mother
allegedly
wronged
him,
going
through
her
psychological
distress
years
earlier,
postpartum
depression
and
things
with
a
miscarriage
that
she
had
had.
but
he
doesn't
talk
about
the
child
in
any
way,
shape
or
form.
all
he
talked
about
was
how
he
had
been
wronged
at
the
hands
of
this
woman.
but
what
he
did
do
is
he
put
all
his
eggs
in
one
constitutional
basket.
seven
weeks
or
six
weeks
after
this
court...
after
the
family
court
signed
the
order
of
adoption,
this
court
announced
caban.
he
seizes
in
his
114
application
on
caban,
saying
it
is
retroactive
and
therefore
he
has
the
right
to
veto,
and
that's
where
his
rights
spring
from.
and
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
seized
on.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
we
are
not
going
to
hold
caban
retroactive
and
as
a
result
we
don't
even
reach
his
constitutional
arguments.
now,
whether
or
not
one
may
imply
that
they
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
york
statute,
i
suppose
it
may
be
implied,
but
for
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
itself
specifically
stated
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
it
wasn't
addressing
that
issue.
accordingly,
i
suggest
that
this
court
should
not
and
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
this
case,
because
the
court
of
appeals,
rightly
or
wrongly,
said
because
caban
is
not
retroactive
we
are
not
reaching
his
constitutional
arguments.
and
that
in
effect
is
what
they
said.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
i
think
that
under
1257,
subdivision
(2),
there
are
a
couple
of
elements:
one,
the
highest
court
of
the
state...
the
constitutional
argument
must
be
raised
in
the
first
instance.
secondly,
the
highest
court
of
the
state
must
in
fact
affirm
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
that
affirmance
can
be
done
expressly
or
impliedly,
and
it
is
argued
here
that
it's
done
impliedly.
well,
as
i
said,
the
implication
might
be
drawn,
but
for
the
fact
that
the
court
expressly
said
it
wasn't
ruling
on
that
issue.
and
if
the
highest
court
of
the
state
has
not
ruled
on
the
issue,
then
that's
not--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--because
they
found
another
means
out.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
there's
an
independent
grounds.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
a
state
grounds.
it's
caban.
they
addressed
it
in
terms
of
caban.
they
said,
whatever
rights
he
has,
because
that's
all
he
raised
in
his...
that's
all
the
real
substance
that
he
raised
in
his
114--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--i
picked
up
my
cue,
your
honor,
from
the
court
of
appeals.
when
they
tell
me
they're
not
addressing
the
issue,
who
am
i
to
argue
with
the
court
of
appeals
when
they
tell
me
that?
that's
for
this
court
to
do.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
not
at
all,
your
honor.
now,
i
think
a
major
point
that
was
raised
in
quilloin
is
that
this
stepfather
adoption
is
a
very
different
kind
of
adoption.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
the
child
is
going
to
be
placed
in
a
strange
home--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--there
is
no
law,
there
is
no
statute
prohibiting
it.
however,
new
york
has--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--no.
the
case
law
has
said
the
only
instance
where
it
has
been
done
is
with
the
consent
of
the
adoptive
parents.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
issue
came
up
in
this
case
in
the
westchester
county
paternity
proceeding,
where
he
argued
in
that
case,
the
appellant
in
this
case
argued
in
that
case,
that
the
westchester
county
family
court
should
permit
the
paternity
proceeding
to
go
ahead
despite
the
fact
that
there
had
been
an
adoption,
because
it
would
give
him
visitation...
it
might
give
him
visitation
rights,
and
that
the
court
had
the
authority
to
permit
visitation.
in
the
argument
in
that
case...
it
was
all
submitted.
there
was
no
oral
argument.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
yes.
yes,
and
it's--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--that
is
an
inequity
that
this
court
i
think
cleared
up
in
caban.
but
this
is
pre
caban.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
if
this
were
post
caban,
we'd
have
to
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
he
is
the
father.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
but
that's
strictly
just
for
the
sake
of
argument.
if
he
in
fact
is
the
father
and
if
he
in
fact
did
not
waive
his
paternal
rights
through
abandonment
or
lack
of
support
or
whatever--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--then
under
those
circumstances
he
now
could
also
veto
the
adoption.
that's
a
lot
of
if's.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
after
caban.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
first
of
all,
this
is
not
a
direct...
this
case
was
was
not
in
the
appellate
process
at
the
time
caban
came
down.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
this
is
a
separate
proceeding.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
to
set
aside
the
order
of
adoption.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
i
don't
think
there
was
a
number.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
on
this
directly
and
determined
that
it
is
in
fact
a
separate
case,
that
the
order...
that
the
first
case
ended
with
the
filing
of
the
order
of
adoption,
and
that
no
appeal
taken...
actually,
there
was
an
appeal
taken
from
it,
which
was
dismissed
by
operation
of
law.
so
that
that
case
was
over
and
done
with.
this
is
a
separate
application
to
set
it
aside,
which
is
also
permitted.
but
it
is
a
separate
case.
it
is
a
post
judgment
attack.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
yes,
he
did.
he
could
have
moved
to
intervene.
even
post
order,
he
is
permitted
in
a
timely
fashion...
and
there
is
no
rule
on
it
that
says
what
the
timely
fashion
is...
he
could
have
moved--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--yes,
because
what
would
happen
is,
after
judge
elwyn
signs
the
order
he
then
could
move
to
intervene.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
the
right
to
appeal
and
the
right
to
perpetuate--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--i
could
have
appealed.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
i'm
not
sure
i
completely
understand
the
question,
because
if--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--i
think
in
order
to
come
to
that
conclusion
they
have
to
come
to
a
threshold
conclusion,
that
this
is
in
fact
the
same
case.
there's
another
argument
also,
and
that
is
that
the
rights
given
under
caban,
if
they
did
exist,
are
substantive
rights.
it's
substantive
rights
that
lead
to
procedural
due
process
rights,
which
gets
us
back
to
the
procedure
of
111(a),
and
the
procedure
of
111(a)
does
in
fact
provide
a
mechanism
whereby
he
could
have
received
notice.
the
interesting
thing
is
that
even
the
dissenters
throughout
have
never
said
caban
is
retroactive,
have
never
found
that
the
statute
is
infirm.
what
they
did
find
was
that...
i'm
talking
about
the
dissenters
now.
the
dissenters
said,
at
most
there
is
an
abuse
of
discretion.
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
there's
no
abuse
of
discretion
if
one
considers
the
situation
judge
elwyn
was
faced
with
and
the
fact
that
there
were
alternatives,
that
this
fellow
could
have
intervened
and
he
could
have
appealed
from
a
denial
of
the
intervention.
if
the
intervention
had
been
granted
it
would
have
given
him
status
as
a
party,
which
would
have
given
him
a
direct
appeal
in
the
case.
plus,
on
top
of
all
that
he
still
had
a
114
application.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
i
don't
think
it's...
i
don't
think
it's
limited
in
any
way.
i
think
any
person
claiming
an
interest
in
the
action
could
move
to
intervene.
it
may
not
be
granted.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
if
he's
already
a
party
he
has
no
need
to
intervene,
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
either
did
not
have
notice
or
whose
interest
is--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--no.
no,
i
believe
it
just
has
to
be
timely
and
reasonable
time.
it's...
it
mostly
appears
in
weinstein,
corn
and
miller,
under
2
new
york
civil
practice,
and
that's
where
the
discussion
takes
place.
there
are
no
time
limits
set
in
the
statute
regarding
intervention.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
given
the
assumptions
that
we
gave
before,
that
he
is
in
fact
the
father,
can
establish
it,
and
that
he
did
not
otherwise
abandon
the
child--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--that's
right,
this
adoption
is
dead,
finished.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
oh,
yes.
that
is
a
very
major...
it
is
a
very
major
point
of
our
argument,
is
that
we
now
have
a...
we
have
a
child
who
has
always
lived
in
one
family,
we
have
a
person
who
is
a
claimant
who
has
never
sought
custody,
never
had
custody,
never
supported
the
child,
never
done
anything
with
respect
to
this
child,
and
who
concedes
the
propriety
of
the
mother's
home.
if
this
case
is
reversed,
then
there's
a
very
real
potential
that
if
he
can
establish
he's
the
father
and
hasn't
abandoned,
that
he
can
veto
the
adoption.
and
that
is
the
question
that
judge
elwyn
was
faced
with
when
this
came
up
to
him.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
yes.
his
consent...
it's
not
called
veto.
his
consent
to
adoption
is
necessary.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
yes,
yes.
and
there's
no
question
about
it.
this
court
has
determined
that
in
the
caban
case.
by
the
way--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--that's
a
bit
misleading.
to
understand
this
fully--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--right.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
his
mother,
appellant's
mother.
my
client,
at
a
time
when
she
was
in
great
personal
distress,
became
the
ward
in
fact,
if
not
in
law,
of
mr.
lehr's
mother.
she
acted
as
her
guardian,
and
in
fact
that
was
how
the
appellant
and
appellee
met.
so
that
she
was
acting
as
a
grandmother
figure
regardless,
and
that
is
what
happened.
i
point
out
that
he
states
in
one
of
his
papers
that
he
had
offered
to
set
up
a
trust
fund
for
the
child
and
that
this
was
refused.
but
i
point
out
that
the
approval
of
the
mother
was
irrelevant.
he
could
have
set
up
a
totten
trust
regardless.
he
didn't
need
her
permission.
he
claims
that
she
hid
from
him
and
therefore
he
was
deprived
of
taking
advantage
of
the
statute,
the
111(a)
statute,
the
putative
father
registry.
but
he
didn't
even
have
to
know
where
she
was.
we
of
course
deny
that
she
hid
from
him.
but
he
didn't
have
to
know
where
she
was.
that
putative
father
registry
is
open
to
anyone
and
everyone.
it
is
so
broadly
stated
that
a
woman
claiming
to
be
the
father
can
be
guaranteed
of
notice.
it's
not
even
gender
based.
anybody
can
put
their
name
on
that
registry.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
oh,
yes,
abandonment.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
what
i
was
responding
to,
i
believe,
was
mr.
justice
stevens'
question,
that
given
the
givens
that
we
had
before,
that
he
is
in
fact
the
father
and
had
not
abandoned,
then
it
is
an
absolute
veto.
it
is
a
veto
to
the
adoption.
a
veto
to
the
adoption.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
the
statute--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--that's
correct.
the
statute
has
been
revised.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
oh,
certainly.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
yes.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
sure.
in
abuse
cases,
permanent
neglect
cases
like
santosky--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
but
this
court
has
recognized
in
quilloin
that
there
is
a
very
compelling
state
interest
and
public
interest
in
legitimizing...
legitimatizing
existing
family
units--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--that's
true
in
every
adoption
case
there
is.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
yes.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
if
he
is
not
otherwise
disqualified,
yes.
he
would
still
have
to
establish
his
paternity
and--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--that
was
the
status
at
the
time
he
filed
his
paternity
petition.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
he
could
change
his
tune
now.
oh,
he
could
change
his
tune.
he
could
now
seek
custody
if
he
wants.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
sure,
with
a
new
petition.
that
other
petition
was
dismissed.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
but
we
contend
that
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
thing
that
he
could
have
shown
in
his
114
petition
and
failed
to
do.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
no,
i
didn't
contend
that.
i
contend
under
the
statute,
under
new
york
statutory
scheme,
that
could
happen.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
well,
fortunately
or
unfortunately,
new
york
has
changed
its
law
in
response
to
caban
and
has
not
dispensed
with
the
consent.
it
adds
a
new
category
of
persons
whose
consent
is
required.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
which
is
the
father.
but
that
is
a
substantive
right
that
one
must
establish
through
procedural
methods--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--to
establish
that
he
is
the
father.
and
we're
saying
he
had
the
procedure
available
to
him
and
failed
to
take
advantage
of
it.
he
would
argue
that
what
he
did
was
even
more.
i
suggest
that
what
he
did
was
something
other
than
what
the
statute
required,
but
not
more,
because
if
he
had
timely
filed
on
the
putative
father
registry
we
would
have
known
of
his
existence
in
advance.
this
putative
father
registry
was
checked
three
times.
i
checked
it
before
filing
the
petition,
the
court
checked
it
at
the
time
of
filing
the
petition,
and
right
up
to
the
day
we
walked
into
the
court
for
a
hearing
on
january
15th
the
court
again
checked
it
and
got
a
certificate
that
there
was
nobody
on
the
list.
at
this
point
he
still
hadn't
even
started
his
paternity
petition.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
yes.
there
are
two
other
provisions,
also,
that
follow
that.
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
if
this
court
is
going
to
reverse
and
send
it
back,
one,
we
hold
this
child
in
limbo
through
several
more
legal
proceedings;
and,
based
upon
what
your
honor
has
just
stated,
upon
the
face
of
it
he
is
disqualified,
then
what
are
we
doing
here?
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
certainly,
certainly.
starting
with
the
premise
that
we
don't
even
concede
he's
the
father,
there's
the
possibility--
mr.
jay
l.
samoff
--no,
because
i
do
believe
that
in
any
and
all
events
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
notice...
i
mean,
not
be
entitled
to
notice
and
withhold
his
consent,
i
should
say,
even
under
the
new
statute.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
