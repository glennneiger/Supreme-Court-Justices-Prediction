justice

day
o'connor
mr.
freeman,
you're
not
claiming
on
behalf
of
mr.
lehr
that
as
a
matter
of
substantive
due
process
he's
entitled
to
veto
the
adoption,
are
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
samoff,
i
thought
under
the
amended
new
york
law
that
the
consent
of
the
father
would
only
be
required
if
the
father
had
maintained
a
substantial
and
continuous
or
repeated
contact
with
the
child.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
the
payment
of
support,
or
other
things
that
i
would
think
under
the
facts
of
this
case
would
be
very
unlikely
to
be
established.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
the
face
of
it,
would
you
not
agree
that
under
the
amended
statute
even
if
it
were
to
go
back
it
is
certainly
not
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
father
would
have
a
so
called
veto
power
or
would
have
to
consent
to
the
adoption?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
but
assuming
he
establishes
that,
it's
not
quite
the
picture
you
were
painting,
is
it?
