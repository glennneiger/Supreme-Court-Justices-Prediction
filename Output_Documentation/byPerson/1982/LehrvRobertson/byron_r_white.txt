justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
something
about
the
registry
that
would
foreclose
an
argument
something
like
this:
well,
the
state
has
given
the
putative
father
a
method
of
assuring
that
he's
gotten...
that
he
will
get
notice,
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
state
shouldn't
give
notice
if
they
know
of
the
identity
and
location
of
the
putative
father
by
some
other
means.
is
there
something
about
the
registry
that
prevents
that
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
here
he
certainly
made
his
presence
known.
by
the
time
the
adoption
proceeding
was
final,
the
adoption
was
finalized,
the
court,
the
adoption
court,
knew
about
him.
they
had
actually
given
him
some
show
cause
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
wasn't...
i
know
it
wasn't
meaningful
notice
about
the
adoption,
but
they
knew
who
he
was--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
what
his
claims
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
something
about
the
registry
that
would
say
that
the
only
way
the
state
can
be
given
notice
is
through
the
registry?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
that's
a
much
easier
argument
for
you
to
make
than
the
one
you're
trying
to
make.
to
follow
up
on
that,
mr.
freeman,
you
certainly
do
not
have
to
urge
this
court
to
require
that
notice
be
given
to
every
putative
father,
by
publication
or
otherwise,
to
win
your
case,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
should
just
argue
that
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
certainly
made
that
claim
in
the
lower
courts,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
veto,
that
they
must
have
his
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
and
that
it's
a
denial
of
equal
protection
if
you
don't
get
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
answer
of
the
lower
courts
to
your
claim
under
caban?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
happen
if
he
had
been
on
the
register?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a...
i
thought
you've
been
arguing
that
it
wouldn't
have
made
much
difference,
that
the
adoption
would
have
had
to
go
through
anyway
because
it
was
a
stepfather
adoption.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
why
did
the
judge
issue
an
order
to
show
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
after
all...
after
the
proceeding
was
all
over,
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
you
want
it
over
there--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
it
was
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
had
been
transferred?
what
would
you
have
done
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
you're
doing
now,
ignore
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
had
been
transferred?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
he
have
then
had
an
opportunity
to
be
heard?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can't
avoid
jurisdiction
here
just
by
saying,
we
don't
want
to
deal
with
the
constitutional
claims,
if
they're
properly
presented.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
it
avoid
it
if
it's
properly
presented
and
might
be
determinative
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
do
you
think
it's
an
independent
state
ground,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
you
reject
the
claim,
if
you
reject
the
caban
claim,
you
have
rejected
the
federal
issue.
it
may
be,
it
may
have
rejected
it
correctly,
but
that
doesn't
mean
there's
no
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
is
it,
in
new
york
is
it
inconsistent
with
the
adoption
to
give
visitation
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
never
done,
though,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
a
mother
always
have
the
power
to
veto
an
adoption
in
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
child
is
living
with
the
father
and
always
has,
and
the
mother
has
departed
and
remarries,
and
the
father
remarries
and
the
new
mother
wants
to
adopt
the
child,
the
mother
can
nevertheless
veto
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
this
were
post
caban
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
getting
there,
you're
getting
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
after
caban,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't...
this
is
a
civil
case.
why
shouldn't
we
apply
the
law
as
it
is
in
an
appellate
court
the
way
the
law
is
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
motion
to
reconsider
or
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
it
got
a
different
number?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
made
a...
the
motion
is
made
in
this
case,
the
same
case.
there's
a
procedure
whereby
you
can
attempt
to
reopen
the
same
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
he
had
no
way
of
appealing
the
adoption.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
would
have
a
different
consequence
than
this
procedure
he
did
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
sort
of
a
way
of
avoiding
intervention,
having
to
intervene.
you
make
this
motion
and
if
you
have
some
standing
you
make
it,
and
the
court
rules
on
your
questions
on
the
merits.
you
for
all
practical
purposes
are
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
court
had
taken
his
caban
claim
and
said,
yes,
it's
retroactive?
what
would
they
have
done
with
it?
you
would
have
said,
well,
i
guess
caban
is
retroactive.
then
what
would
have
happened
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
said
caban
is
retroactive
and
denying
him
the
power
to
veto
the
adoption
is
unconstitutional.
what
would
have
happened
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
ruled
the
other
way
on
the
caban
claim,
namely
that
it
is
retroactive.
what
would
the
court
have
done,
said,
sorry,
but
this
is
a
separate
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
the
mother's
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
vetoing
the
adoption
or
refusing
to
consent
to
the
adoption
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
custody.
the
child
would
continue
to
live
with
the
mother.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
wasn't
an
adoption,
but
just
custody
by
the
mother,
unless
the
father
was
somehow
disqualified
he
could
have
visitation
rights
and
could
maintain
some
kind
of
a
relationship
with
his
child.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
wouldn't
win
unless
he
shows
the
mother
is
unfit
to
have
custody.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
change
the
law
about
the
necessity
for
the
mother's
consent,
put
them
on
an
equal
basis,
and
caban
is
out
the
window.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
the
fathers.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
