justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
freeman,
does
that
mean,
if
you
rely
on
the
biological
relationship
as
a
sufficient
justification
for
the
liberty
interest...
say
there
are
no
statutes
at
all...
does
that
mean
there
could
never
be
a
valid
adoption
carried
out
where
a
mother
places
a
child
for
adoption
without
giving
notice
to
the
parent,
to
the
father?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
always
entitled
to
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
does
that
mean
with
respect
to
a
mother
with
a
newborn
infant
who
wishes
to
place
the
baby
for
adoption
in
the
most
expeditious
manner
possible?
does
your
view
of
the
constitution
require
that
she
give
notice
to
the
father?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
state
must
make
sure
that
they--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
include
identification
of
the
mother,
of
course,
and
her
predicament?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
would
the
notice...
how
would
a
publication
be
meaningful
unless
you
knew
who
the
person
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
give
me
an
example
of
a
sufficient
notice
by
publication.
child
x,
born
on
such
and
such
a
date?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
does
it
require
if
you
don't
know
the
father?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
would
the
publication
say?
would
it
not
have
to
identify
the
mother
to
have
any
meaning
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
a
meaningless
notice
is
sufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
a
meaningless
notice
is
sufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
on
that,
because
some
of
the
other
questions
have
indicated
that
your
case
is
particularly
appealing
because
the
judge
knew
about
your
client
before
the
final
order
of
adoption
was
entered.
would
you
think
the
case
would
be
different
if
only
the
adoptive
parents
knew
about
your
client,
that
the
judge
didn't
know?
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
any
time...
your
position
really
is
that
any
time
the
mother
knows
the
identity
of
the
father
the
father's
entitled
to
notice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
why
he
didn't
get
his
name
put
on
the
birth
certificate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
really
had
two
pretty
simple
opportunities,
one
to
get
his
name
on
the
birth
certificate
and
the
other
to
file
with
this
registry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there's
any...
do
you
think
there's
any
way
in
which
a
putative
father
could
waive
all
these
rights?
supposing
he
just
had
not
been
there
at
the
birth
or
had
gone
to
alaska
or
someplace?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i'm
trying
to
ask
is,
would
this
case
be
different
if
he
had
gone
away?
say
he
knew
the
girl
was
pregnant
and
he
left
right
away,
came
back
two
years
later
and
decided
he
now
wanted
to
assert
an
interest
in
becoming,
you
know,
the
father
of
the
child
before
the
adoption
was
final?
would
he
have
the
same
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question.
forgetting
a
moment
all
the
possible
proceedings
that
might
have
taken
place,
supposing
the
court
now
thinks
that
there
should
have
been
notice
to
the
father
and
they
set
aside
the
decree,
and
so
you
have
to
start
all
over.
is
it
not
clear
that
if
that
happens
then
caban
will
apply
and
then
there
is
no
way
in
the
world
you
can
adopt
without
his
consent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
actually,
although
we're
addressing
a
procedural
point,
we
may
actually
also
decide
the
merits
inevitably?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
just
ask
one
question.
you
do
object
to
the
adoption,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
your
client--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
do
object.
that's
all
i
asked.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york.
it
involves
a
constitutionality
of
the
new
york
adoption
statute
and
more
particularly
the
validity
of
an
adoption
order
entered
pertaining
to
a
child
who
was
born
out
of
wedlock
and
adopted
at
approximately
age
of
two
years.
the
putative
father
of
the
child
claims
that
the
adoption
is
invalid
and
that
the
statute
pursuant
to
which
the
adoption
was
ordered
is
itself
invalid
because
it
did
not
provide
that
he
would
receive
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
the
adoption
order
was
entered.
the
new
york
adoption
statute
provides
for
notice
to
several
categories
of
fathers,
those
whose
names
appear
on
the
birth
certificate,
those
who
lived
with
the
child
and
the
mother,
those
who
were
married
to
the
mother
within
six
months
of
the
birth
and
most
relevant
in
this
case,
those
who
have
had
their
names
placed
on
what
is
known
as
the
putative
father
registry
which
is
a
registry
which
the
father
need
only
send
a
postcard
in
to
have
his
name
on
the
registry
and
then
in
the
event
of
an
adoption
of
the
child,
he's
automatically
guaranteed
notice.
the
putative
father
in
this
case
did
none
of
these
things
and
had
established
no
meaningful
relationship
of
any
kind
with
the
child
during
the
two
years
--
the
first
two
years
of
her
life
and
was
not
--
had
not
lived
with
the
mother
during
that
period
of
time.
for
reasons
that
we
set
out
in
greater
detail
in
the
opinion
we
hold
that
he
was
not
--
had
not
formed
the
kind
of
relationship
with
the
child
that
would
entitle
him
to
notice
and
therefore
that
the
adoption
order
is
valid
and
that
the
new
york
statutory
procedure
as
applied
in
this
case
is
valid.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justice
marshall
and
justice
blackmun.
