mr.
david
l.
freeman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
the
court's
permission,
i
will
first
have
a
brief
opening
statement,
then
address
myself
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
and
then
proceed
with
the
balance
of
my
argument.
on
march
7th,
1979,
jonathan
lehr
was
deprived
of
the
most
basic
and
precious
of
all
human
rights,
the
right
to
maintain
his
status
as
a
parent.
for
on
that
date
jessica,
whom
mr.
lehr
had
always
openly
acknowledged
to
be
his
daughter,
both
before
and
after
birth,
was
adopted
by
the
appellee,
richard
robertson,
the
husband
of
the
natural
mother.
according
to
new
york
law,
as
a
result
of
that
adoption
mr.
lehr's
rights
as
a
parent
were
forever
and
irrevocably
extinguished.
there
would
be
no
more
contacts
of
any
nature
with
jessica,
no
visitations,
no
rights
of
inheritance.
mr.
lehr
was
deprived
of
this
child
without
being
given
the
opportunity
of
notice
and
the
opportunity
to
be
heard,
for
according
to
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
then
in
force
and
effect
mr.
lehr
was
precluded
from
receiving
notice
as
those
statutes
were
construed
and
applied
to
him.
what
makes
this
lack
of
notice
even
more
emphatic
was
the
fact
that
at
the
very
time
that
mr.
lehr's
rights
were
being
stripped
in
the
adoption
proceeding
in
ulster
county,
he
had
commenced
a
paternity
petition
in
westchester
county,
unbeknown
to
him
that
the
adoption
proceedings
were
pending.
in
westchester
county
he
asserted
his
rights
as
a
parent.
he
asked
that
the
child
be
adjudicated
and
that
he
be
made
the
father,
that
he
be
given
visitation
rights
and
that
he
be
given
the
right
to
support
jessica.
the
family
court
judge
in
ulster
county
knew
of
this
petition.
mr.
lehr
had
to
assert
his
rights
in
this
manner
because
he
was
prevented
from
asserting
them
after
jessica's
birth,
for
after
mr.
lehr's
last
visit
at
the
hospital
during
father's
visiting
hours
to
see
jessica,
lorraine,
the
natural
mother,
withheld
the
whereabouts
of
jessica
for
approximately
six
months,
after
which
mr.
lehr
had
an
opportunity
to
see
jessica
on
a
couple
of
weekends,
and
thereafter
for
approximately
14
months
before
mr.
lehr
instituted
these
paternity
proceedings
lorraine
robertson
withheld
the
whereabouts
of
jessica
from
mr.
lehr.
mr.
lehr
tried
desperately
to
find
jessica.
however,
he
was
unsuccessful
until
right
before
he
started
the
paternity
proceedings,
at
which
time
he
sought
counsel
and
then
asserted
his
rights
as
a
father
in
the
paternity
proceeding
in
westchester
county.
this
court
has
raised
the
question
of
jurisdiction
as
to
whether
or
not
it
has
the
right
to
hear
this
appeal.
mr.
lehr
claims
and
has
claimed
in
all
three
courts
below
that
he
was
denied
of
his
constitutional
rights
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
as
construed
and
applied
to
him
denied
him
notice
and
the
opportunity
to
be
heard.
in
particular,
i'm
referring
to
sections
111(a)
and
111
of
the
new
york
domestic
relations
law.
by
the
terms
and
provisions
of
that
law,
in
particular
section
111(a),
only
seven
categories
of
unwed
fathers
were
entitled
to
receive
notice.
according
to
the
record,
mr.
lehr
was
not
one
of
these,
although
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
might
have
fit
into
one
of
these
categories,
as
to
whether
or
not
lorraine,
the
natural
mother,
had
filed
a
written
sworn
statement
indicating
that
mr.
lehr
was
the
father.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
one
of
the
categories
is
a
father
who
registers
by
filing
a
notice
of
intent
to
claim
paternity.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
no,
mr.
lehr
never
did.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
mr.
lehr
could
have,
theoretically,
if
he
knew
of
the
registry.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
theoretically
because,
number
one,
if
he
knew
of
the
registry
he
could
have
registered
in
it.
mr.
lehr
indicates
that
he
did
not
know
of
the
registry.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
he
had
counsel
at
the
time.
starting
in
december
he
had
counsel.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
no,
counsel
did
not
advise
him
to
file
in
the
putative
father
registry.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
no,
the
record
does
not
show
why
not.
when
it
came
time
for
mr.
lehr
to
assert
his
rights,
the
putative
father
registry
did
not
have
what
mr.
lehr
sought.
the
putative
father
registry
is
a
mere
notice,
an
irrevocable
notice
by
one
intending
to
claim
paternity.
mr.
lehr--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--had
he
been
registered,
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
notice
of
the
adoption
proceedings.
but
we
do
not
look
to
the
state
law
as
the
source
of
our
liberty
interest
here.
the
state
law
has
construed
the
fact
that
in
order
to
obtain
a
liberty
interest
worthy
of
protection
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
one
must
be
the
biological
father
and
in
addition
that
one
must
perform
one
of
the
seven
acts
enumerated
in
section
111(a).
mr.
lehr
looks
at
the
federal
constitution
for
the
source
of
his
liberty
interest
and
for
his
protection
under
the
constitution.
it's
submitted
that--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--no,
the
creation
of
a
liberty
interest
has
two
sources,
the
federal
constitution
and
the
state.
but
the
state
has
minimum
constitutional
standards
that
we
felt
were
not
met
by
section
111(a).
if
the
state
establishes--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--the
state
can
set
up
its
own
procedural
requirements,
as
long
as
they
meet
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
due
process
safeguards
that
have
been
established
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
state
cannot
go
below
those
minimum
due
process
safeguards.
it
is
our
contention
here
that
the
state
has
gone
far
below.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
i'm
suggesting
that
the
registry
right
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
have
that
constitutional
right.
what
we
have
here
is
a
liberty
interest
to
maintain
a
status
as
a
parent.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
that's
correct.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
pardon
me?
mr.
david
l.
freeman
yes.
we've
indicated
that
that's
true.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
because
what
new
york
state
has
said
is
that
before
mr.
lehr
was
entitled
to
due
process
safeguards
that
he
had
to
file
in
the
putative
father
registry
or
perform
one
of
the
other
acts,
and
that
he
had
to
be
a
biological
father.
they
have
two
elements
that
they
require
before
he
has
a
liberty
interest.
it's
suggested
that
mr.
lehr's
right
as
a
biological
father,
the
fact
that
he's
one,
claiming
to
be
the
biological
father
entitles
him
to
due
process
procedures.
we
then
look
to
due
process
procedures
to
see
what
process
was
due
him,
and
it's
contended
that
notice
and
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
are
required
before
mr.
lehr's
liberty
interest
was
terminated
here.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
it's
our
contention,
although
we
don't
fit
within
that
category--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--it's
our
contention
that
notice
and
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
must
be
given.
a
biological
father
is
enough
to
bring
in--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--no,
not
necessarily
entitled
to...
what
i'm
trying
to
indicate
is
that
once
a
father
is
a
biological
father,
he
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
absolutely.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
the
state
must
make
reasonable
efforts
to
notify
the
father
in
accordance
with
due
process.
as
this
court
has
indicated
on
a
number
of
occasions
where
identity
cannot
be
found
and
notice
by
publication
is
the
only
means
of
notifying
somebody,
then
the
court...
the
court's
permitted
to
notify
somebody
and
cut
off
the
constitutional
rights.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
there
should
be
notice
by
publication.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
pardon?
an
unknown
biological
father.
if
the
mother
has
not
identified
the
father,
then
there
should
be
some
form
of
notice,
either
notice
by
publication,
to
whom
it
may
concern--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--not
necessarily
the
identification
of
the
mother.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
you
could
identify
the
child.
you
could
possibly,
if
the
father
knew
the
child--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--we're
not
saying
that
notice
by
publication
has
to
be
sufficient.
we're
saying
that
you
give
what
due
process
requires
in
the
circumstances.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
it
requires
notice
by...
some
form
of
notice
by
publication.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
yes,
but
nobody
says
that
it
has
to
have
meaning.
if
a
father
has
not
done
enough
acts
so
that
he
is
in
communication
with
the
mother--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--pardon
me?
mr.
david
l.
freeman
in
some
aspects,
meaningless...
no,
we're
giving
him
notice.
the
very
fact...
if
the
court's
referring
to
the
case
of
mullane,
where
the
court
indicated
there
you
may
have
to
give
meaningless
notice,
notice
that
may
oftentimes
be
futile,
knowing
that
you're
not
going
to
get
to
the
party
with
whom
the
notice
is
directed.
but
if
that's
the
only
thing
that's
available,
then
that's
what's
given.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
but
that's
not--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--once
again,
it's
our
position
that
the
state
cannot
do...
we're
not
looking...
the
state
has
not
met
its
due
process
requirements.
the
due
process--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--mr.
lehr
did
much
more
than
register.
mr.
lehr's
identity
was
known
to
all
concerned
at
this
particular
time.
the
state
knew
of
mr.
lehr's
concern.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
for
the
purpose
of
readily
identifiable
fathers.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
no,
there's
nothing
about
the
registry.
the
registry,
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--no.
well,
that
was
not
meaningful
notice.
notice--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--oh,
definitely.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
absolutely.
the
judge
knew
about
that
well
before
he
signed
the
order
of
adoption.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
no.
it's
our
contention
that
the
state
could
be
given
notice
in
any
number
of
ways.
the
state--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--i
indicated
that
that
was
not
our
case.
i
said
we
had
done
much
more
than
that.
we
were
a
readily
identifiable
father
who
had
shown
concern
for
his
child.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
argue--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
no.
this
is
a
central
registry
in
the
state.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
in
albany.
and
at
the
last
count,
since
the
registry
was
instituted
in
1977
there
have
been
600-some
odd
fathers
who
have
filed
in
the
putative
father
registry,
despite
the
fact
that
there
have
been
maybe
approximately
200,000
out
of
wedlock
births
during
that
same
period
of
time.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
there's
a
number
of
reasons
why
the
fathers
aren't
willing
to
advertise
their
relationship.
our
contention
is
that
most
fathers
don't
know
about
the
putative
father
registries,
and
those
fathers
that
are
concerned
for
their
children--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--in
our
case
it
was
no
reason--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--well,
first
of
all,
the
notice
is
a
revocable
notice,
so
that
if
he
can
file
it
he
can
take
it
back,
number
one.
number
two,
those
fathers
that
are
concerned
and
caring
for
their
children
would
have
no
need
to
file
in
the
putative
father
registry.
they
may
be
openly
living
with
the
mother,
or
they
may
be
visiting
with
the
child
on
a
regular
basis,
or
they
may
have
established
some
sort
of
contact
with
the
child.
they
would
have
no
reason
to
file
in
the
putative
father
registry.
and
that
was
the
case
with
mr.
lehr.
even
had
he
known
about
the
putative
father
registry,
he
would
have
had
no
reason
to
file
because
both...
as
the
record
indicates,
the
natural
mother
knew
and
acknowledged
to
others
that
lehr
was
the
father
here.
there
was
no
secret
here.
there
was
no
right
of
privacy
involved
here.
everybody
knew
that
mr.
lehr
was
the
natural
father.
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
determining
what
procedural
safeguards
must
be
given
when
a
liberty
interest
is
terminated
or
created
looks
to
a
number
of
factors.
the
first
factor
is
the
type
of
risk
that's
involved,
that
if
notice
and
the
opportunity
is
not
given
what
type
of
risk
is
there
that
there
will
be
an
erroneous
termination
of
these
parental
rights?
what
did
we
have
in
ulster
county?
we
had
an
ex
parte
hearing.
we
had
parties
present
who
were
interested
in
one
side
of
the
coin.
they
wanted
the
adoption
of
jessica.
there
was
nobody
present
to
cross...
examine,
a
basic
tenet
of
our
society,
that
when
facts
are
relevant
to
the
determination
of
an
action
that
that
party
have
the
right
of
cross
examination.
here
there
was
a
secret
one
sided
determination
of
the
child's
best
interests.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
in
addition,
mr.
lehr,
had
he
been
made
a
party
to
these
adoption
proceedings,
would
have
assisted
the
judge
in
making
a
determination
as
to
the
child's
best
interests.
mr.
lehr's
input
here
would
have
been
substantial.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
we've
made
that
contention,
and
we
believe
that
mr.
lehr
does
have
the
substantive
right
of
veto
to...
the
substantive
right
to
veto
the
adoption,
in
addition
to
other
substantive
rights
that
he
does
have:
the
right
to
have
a
hearing
as
to
the
child's
best
interests,
the
right
to
prove
that
he
is
fit
or
unfit
to
exercise
that
very
right
to
veto.
we
cannot
presume,
nobody
can
presume,
that
mr.
lehr
did
not
have
a
substantial
relationship
with
that
child,
say
one
that
may
have
been
similar
to
stanley.
we
don't
know
about
what
type
of
relationship
mr.
lehr
has
until
he's
put
in
that
courtroom
and
given
the
opportunity
to
be
heard.
without
being
given
this
right,
the
court
has
no
way
of
knowing
of
the
type
of
relationship
which
mr.
lehr
had
established
and
the
type
of
relationship
which
he
intended
to
establish
in
the
future.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
mr.
lehr
brought
on
a
petition
for
visitation
rights.
mr.
lehr
was
denied--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--we
don't
know.
there
was
no
hearing.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
pardon
me?
mr.
david
l.
freeman
what
claim
is
that,
mr.
justice?
mr.
david
l.
freeman
oh.
we
do
claim,
we
do
claim
that
he
has
the
right
to
veto.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
well,
as
i've
indicated,
he
has
the
right
to
be
heard
on
the
best
interests
of
his
child.
new
york
already
provides
for
that.
section
111
(a)
provides
that
those
unwed
fathers
who
receive
notice
of
the
adoption
proceeding
have
the
right
to
be
heard
on
the
child's
best
interests.
in
addition,
mr.
lehr
would
have
been
heard
as
to
whether
or
not
the
new
adoptive
parents
were
fit
to
have
an
adoption.
there
have
been
new
york
cases
which
have
indicated
that
because
of
the
history
of
the
natural
mother,
the
emotional
history
of
the
natural
mother,
an
adoption
was
not
permitted,
irrespective
of
the
fitness
of
the
adoptive
father.
mr.
lehr
had
substantial...
mr.
lehr
lived
with
the
natural
mother
here
for
a
period
of
almost
approximately
two
years
prior
to
the
birth
of
jessica.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
and
new
york
statutes...
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
new
york
statutes
provide
that
you
do
have
a
right
of
hearing,
to
be
heard
as
to
the
child's
best
interests.
now,
this
court
has
held
that
where
these
deprivations
are
so
substantial
as
they
are
here
there
is
a
need
for
heightened
procedural
due
process
safeguards.
we're
basically
talking
about
the
most
rudimentary
of
all
procedural
due
process
safeguards.
we're
not
talking
about
a
higher
evidentiary
burden,
such
as
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
we're
talking
about
the
basic
right
to
be
heard,
the
basic
right
for
a
citizen
to
have
his
day
in
court
before
he's
deprived.
this
court
has
held
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
this
basic
right
to
be
heard
is
given
where
there
is
a
loss
of
mere
property,
a
mere
driver's
license,
where
wages
are
garnished,
where
there's
a
repossession
of
a
car.
courts
have
given
those
people
the
right
to
be
heard.
here
we
have
something
much
greater
to
lose.
we
have
a
child
to
lose,
and
even
the
risk
of
one
loss
is
too
great
here,
so
that
notice
is
mandatory
in
these
type
of
situations.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
the
lower
courts...
the
family
court
gave
caban
retroactivity,
but
indicated
that
because
the
father
here
hadn't
established
a
sufficient
relationship
with
the
child
that
caban
was
distinguishable.
the
appellate
division
denied
retroactivity
of
caban,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
view.
it
is
our
claim
that
caban
should
be
applied
retroactively
to
this
case,
although
that
is
not
our
main
point
nor
does
our
case
rest
or
fall
on
that
point.
our
case
is
basically
one
of
notice,
one
of
procedural
due
process,
and
it
is
that
where...
it
is
on
that
issue
where
the
case
falls.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
i
think
he
still
would
have
been
entitled
to
notice.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
that's
correct,
and
that's
something,
say,
something
like
the
uniform
parentage
act
has
indicated
that
when
the
mother
puts
the
child
up
for
adoption
that
she...
one
of
the
questions
asked
of
her
is
to
identify
the
father.
this
goes
to
encouraging
the
state's
interest
of
finality.
perhaps
the
most
important
state
interest
that
we
have
here
is
having
an
adoption
proceeding
that
is
final.
the
very
fact
that
the
state
did
not
give
jonathan
lehr
notice
here
is
adversely...
affects
that
state
interest.
we
all
know
that
to
obtain
finality
in
any
proceeding
the
idea
is
to
get
as
many
parties
to
the
proceeding
as
possible,
especially
where
those
parties'
rights
are
being
adversely
affected.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
the
record
merely
indicates
that
he
had
assumed
that
his
name
was
on
the
birth
certificate.
there
was
no
reason...
according
to
new
york--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--well,
we
don't
claim
that
due
process
requires
that
we
first
know
of
a
putative
father
registry
or
that
we
know
of
public
health
law
4135,
which
says
that
you
have
to
file
an
affidavit.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
he
would
not
appear
at
the
proceedings.
as
was
indicated
in
a
prior
case
of
this
court,
stanley
versus
illinois,
those
fathers
that
do
not
wish
to
appear
will
not
appear,
and
their
rights
will
be
constitutionally
foreclosed
provided
that
some
form
of
notice
was
attempted
to
be
given
to
them.
those
are
the
fathers
that
aren't
going
to
come
forward.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
absolutely.
he
has
the
right
to
be
heard.
we
don't
know...
how
do
we
know
as
to
whether
or
not
mr.
lehr
is
going
to
be
similarly
situated
to
a
mother?
what
do
we
know
his
relationship
was?
this
court
has
held
that
an
unwed
father
can
be
similarly
situated
to
an
unwed
mother.
they
held
that
in
stanley
and
they
held
that
in
caban.
we
don't
know.
that's
the
very
point
of
this
case.
mr.
lehr's
rights
as
a
parent
were
foreclosed
without
the
court
knowing
anything.
in
fact,
what
the
court
did
know
was
that
there
was
a
very
concerned
father
out
there
who
wanted
to
visit
with
the
child
and
wanted
to
support
the
child.
that's
what
the
court
did
know.
yet
it
didn't
act
on
this.
and
the
new
york
court
below,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
indicated
that
the
family
court
judge
was
precluded
from
giving
notice
to
mr.
lehr,
despite
this
knowledge,
because
of
the
provisions
of
section
111
and
section
111
(a).
mr.
david
l.
freeman
no,
he
hasn't,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
once
again,
mr.
lehr
when
the
child
was
born
paid
for
the...
had
had
his
mother
pay
for
the
child's
birth,
afterwards
had
requested
that
he
be
given
the
right
to
support,
was
denied
by
the
natural
mother.
mr.
lehr
then
went
to
court
and
asked
the
court
to
impose
support
obligations
upon
him.
mr.
lehr
made
every
effort
to
give
this
child
support.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
the
natural
mother
indicated
that
she
would
not
accept
it.
but
we
can't
go
into
the
nature
or
extent
of
this
relationship
based
on
conflicting
affidavits
here.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
there's
two
points
i'd
like
to
point
out
here.
i'm
glad
that
caban
point
was
cleared
up.
the
very
fact
that
this
case
goes
back
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
this
adoption
will
not
remain
or
that
the
parents
will
be
broken
up
or
that
custody
will
be
changed.
new
york
has
a
continuous
relationship
statute,
as
justice
o'connor
has
indicated.
great
mention
here
has
been
made
of
the
fact
that
mr.
lehr
has
not
shown
in
his
affidavit
sufficient
facts
which
would
warrant
the
belief
that
he
would
have
any
input
into
the
best
interest
hearing
here.
due
process
does
not
say
that
because
one...
once
one
is
entitled
to
notice
under
due
process,
you
must
wipe
the
slate
clean,
as
this
court
has
said
in
armstrong
versus
manzo,
go
back
to
the
position
where
he
would
have
been
had
he
been
given
notice.
the
fact
that...
the
facts
that
show
that
he
might
not
be
entitled
to
the
substantive
relief
that
he
may
be
requesting
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
his
right
to
notice.
much
also
has
been
made
about
this
intervention
motion
here.
in
substance,
probably,
the
intervention
motion
was
made
by
the
motion
to
vacate.
it's
in
fact
the
same
type
of
motion,
asking
to
be
a
party
in
the
proceedings.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
pardon
me?
mr.
david
l.
freeman
no,
there
will
be
a
reopening
of
the
adoption
proceedings.
mr.
david
l.
freeman
there
should
be
a
starting
of
de
novo,
or
possibly,
there
is
the
other
possibility,
where
a
hearing
would
be
held
as
if
the
adoption
had
not
taken
place,
giving
the
appellant
all
the
rights
that
he
would
have
had
had
he
been
given
notice
originally.
all
we're
asking
for
is
to
be
heard
on
whatever
substantive
rights
we
may
have.
we
don't
know
what
substantive
rights
we're
going
to
have.
they're
going
to
depend
on
our
contacts
with
the
child.
the
new
york
statute
now
provides
that
one
of
the
factors
that's
taken
into
consideration
is
whether
or
not
the
father
was
prevented
from
seeing
the
child
by
the
mother.
and
in
addition,
the
new
york
statute
provides
that
the
amount
of
support
which
he
is
required
to
give
is
dependent
upon
his
financial
circumstances.
getting
back
to
the
intervention
motion
for
a
second--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--pardon
me?
mr.
david
l.
freeman
yes,
we
object
to
the
adoption
because
it
terminates
our
parental
rights
forever,
and
we
cannot
see
jessica
any
more
unless--
mr.
david
l.
freeman
--okay.
with
respect
to
the
intervention
motion,
what
the
appellees
are
contending
is
that
in
order
to
get
due
process
one
must
file
a
notice
to
intervene,
and
that
of
course
does
not
follow
from
what
our
constitution
says.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
