tell
me
about
these
registries.
are
they
county
registries?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where,
at
albany?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
don't
think
you
can
condemn
procedures
of
that
kind.
most
adoptions
are
carried
out
that
way.
but
here,
of
course,
your
position
is
that
his
parenthood
was
known
and
the
court
knew
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
under
your
state
law
is
that
an
absolute
veto?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--i'm
still
bothered
by
your
absolute
veto
provisions.
surely
in
new
york
a
child
can
be
taken
away
from
a
parent
under
certain
circumstances.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then,
it
isn't
an
absolute
veto.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
a
child
can
even
be
taken
away
from
a
mother.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
lassiter.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
some
of
the
other
things
are
examples
of
that.
