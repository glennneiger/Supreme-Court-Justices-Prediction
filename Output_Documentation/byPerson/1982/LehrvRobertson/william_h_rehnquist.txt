justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
suggest
by
that
the
state
has
no
power
to
place
some
orderly
procedures
in
the
area?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
speaking
of
the
statutory
process.
let's
assume
the
constitutional
right
that
you
choose
to
oppose,
for
a
moment.
can
the
state
put
procedural
requirements
in
the
exercise
of
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
the
registry
requirement
is
in
conflict
with
the
constitutional
right
that
you
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
there
must
be
some
substantive
right
that
you
contend
for
your
client,
because
otherwise
to
afford
him
this
hearing,
if
he
doesn't
have
any
claims
that
would
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration
at
the
hearing,
doesn't
make
much
sense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
once
you
establish
your
procedural
claim
new
york
statutes
give
you
substantive
interests
which
you
can
assert
at
the
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
samoff,
what's
the
distance
between
kingston
and
white
plains?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
you
summarize
what
his
allegations
were
in
the
114
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it's
only
an
absolute
veto
because
the
new
york
statute
gives
the
mother
an
absolute
veto
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
caban
was
an
equal
protection
case.
it
wasn't
a
substantive
due
process.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
samoff,
are
you
saying
or
conceding
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
that
if
the
natural
father
does
not
abandon
the
child
and
doesn't
consent
to
an
adoption
he
can
veto
any
adoption
until
the
child
reaches
majority?
perhaps
this
court
has
held
that;
i
just
hadn't
realized
it.
