chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
lehr
against
robertson.
mr.
freeman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
now,
the
state
here--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--excuse
me.
the
state
here
in
effect,
perhaps
for
the
reason
that
published
notice
is
usually
generally
pretty
meaningless,
but
in
this
setting
would
be
particularly
so,
as
justice
stevens
has
pointed
out,
and
to
identify
the
mother
and
the
child
would
cause
an
embarrassment
that
would
haunt
them
the
rest
of
their
lives,
so
the
state
said,
now,
all
you
men
who
want
to
make
claims
on
your
illegitimate
children,
file
in
this
registry
and
then
you'll
have
all
the
notices.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
has
he
met...
has
he
met...
has
he
given
support
to
his
claim
by
his
failure
to
register?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
state
didn't
know.
the
state
had
this
statute
for
the
purpose
of
identifying
the
claimant,
did
it
not,
the
putative
father
registry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it...
could
we
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
such
fathers
are
ordinarily
not
anxious
to
advertise
their
relationship?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
whether
they
know
about
the
registry.
assume
they
know
about
it.
is
it
not
a
fact
of
human
nature
and
common
human
experience
that
most
such
fathers
do
not
want
to
advertise
their
parenthood?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
your
case.
i'm
talking
about
the
generality.
and
it's
the
generality
that
i'm
addressing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
he
furnished
support
for
the
child
since
its
birth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
doesn't
suggest
any
great
anxiety
to
assume
that--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--well,
does
he
need
a
court
order
to
send
a
check
every
month
or
periodically?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
can
if
we
want
to.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
can.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
every
case
that's
been
decided
by
this
court
where
they've
dealt
with
what
type
of
relationship...
in
the
quilloin
case
the
court
indicated
that
support
was
irregular,
but
they
only
indicated
that
after
there
was
a
full
evidentiary
hearing
at
which
the
father
had
the
right
to
give
any
and
all
evidence
concerning
his
individualized
interests
in
that
child,
despite
the
fact
that
maybe
he
didn't
have
the
substantive
right
to
veto
that
adoption
or...
and
continue
his
visitation.
the
very
mere
fact
that
a
person
doesn't
have
custody
of
a
child
doesn't
mean
his
parental
rights
can
be
terminated.
i
mean,
he
can
show
the
court
where
it
would
be
in
the
best
interests
of
a
child
to
have
visitations
and
his
parental
rights
continued
beyond
the
time
that
the
adoption
takes
place.
and
it
is
appellant's
contention
that
he
was
not
given
any
opportunity
to
advise
the
court
as
to
what
these
best
interests
were,
and
certainly
the
best
interests
of
jessica
could
not
have
been
fostered
by
the
court
not
taking
these
factors
into
consideration.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
use
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
very
well.
mr.
samoff.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
might
sue
you
for
libel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
just
said
that
he
had
never
done
anything
for
the
child.
i
understood
your
friend
to
say
that
the
appellant
here
had
persuaded
his
mother
to
pay
for
the
hospital
bills.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
the
mother
of
the
child,
but
the
mother
of
the--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--of--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
telling
us
there
will
not
be
a
reopening
of
the
adoption
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
telling
us
that
the
adoption
proceedings
will
not
be
reopened
if
we
reverse
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
they'll
start
de
novo,
won't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the

in
