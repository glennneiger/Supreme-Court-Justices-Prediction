justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
one
of
those
categories
those
who
register
in
that
registry?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
never
did
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
could
have.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
theoretically?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
have
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
counsel
didn't
advise
him
he
might
register?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
show
why
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
he
been
registered,
would
he
not
have
had
notice
of
the
adoption
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
one
of...
as
i
understand
it,
one
of
his
grievances
is
that
he
never
got
notice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet,
apparently
new
york
had
a
procedure
by
which,
had
he
registered,
he
would
have
had
notice
of
the
adoption
proceeding.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
might
have
had
notice
of
the
adoption
proceeding
merely
by
registering
in
the
putative
father
registry.
is
that
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
why...
how
is--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--all
right,
even
if
the
girl
doesn't
identify
who
the
father
is
and
no
one
knows
who
the
father
is,
what...
it
should
be
notice
by
publication?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
an
unknown
biological
father?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
all
that
mr.
lehr
asks
here,
though,
is
visitation
rights,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
issue
of
whether
or
not
he
might
have
a
veto
of
the
adoption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
there
isn't
any
such
issue
in
this
case.
you've
certainly
presented
that
in
the
lower
courts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
all
he
wants
is
visitation,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
all--
--and
if
this
decree
is
reversed,
even
though
there
may
not
be
an
adoption,
i
gather
the
mother
continues,
and
the
stepfather,
with
custody
of
the
child,
and
all
that
he
gets
are
visitation
rights;
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
appreciate
that.
but
all...
the
bottom
line
for
him
if
he
wins
on
his
present
application
is
only
visitation
rights,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
is
it
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
a
new
petition?
