why
didn't
you
give
notice
to
the
father?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
answer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
your
only
answer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
true
that
he
lived
with
your
client
for
two
and
a
half
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
knew
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
knew
the
child
was
born--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--while
they
were
living
together?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
see
how
they
could.
he
couldn't
live
with
her
in
the
hospital.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
lived...
they
were
living
together
when
the
child
was
conceived,
and
you
knew
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
knew
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
all
one
sided,
too,
wasn't
it?
it
was
you
and
the
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
what
you
just
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
was
getting
ready
to
say,
you
don't
mind
us
arguing
a
little
bit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
motion
to
intervene
limited
to
people
who
didn't
have
notice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
think
somebody
who
was
a
party
could,
he
couldn't
intervene?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
party
couldn't
intervene?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
so
it
looks
to
me
like
it's
for
those
who
didn't
have
notice.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
keep
mentioning
it.
i
don't
see
where
it
helps
you.
i
think
it
hurts
you.
is
there
a
period
of
time
specified
under
new
york
law
in
which
intervention
may
be
considered?
