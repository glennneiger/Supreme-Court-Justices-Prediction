mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
claimant
in
this
case
arrived
in
los
angeles
from
vancouver,
canada
on
september
10th,
1975.
on
her
customs
form
was
a
question
asking
whether
she
was
carrying
with
her
more
than
$5,000
in
currency.
that
question
was
answered
"no".
during
the
course
of
the
customs
inspection
process
she
was
three
times
further
asked
whether
she
had
on
her
person
more
than
$5,000
in
currency
and
three
times
denied
it.
because
of
suspicions
of
the
customs
officers
she
was
searched,
and
the
search
revealed
an
envelope
concealed
in
her
brassiere
containing
$8,850
in
united
states
currency.
it's
quite
clear
that
she
knew
that
this
money
was
there,
because
when
the
customs
inspector
counted
the
money
and
erroneously
said
it's
$9,950,
she
said
i
know
it's
less
than
that.
now,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
government...
this
money
was
seized,
by
the
way...
and
the
issue
is
whether
the
government
was
required
to
bring
a
judicial
forfeiture
action
promptly
following
the
procedure
without
regard
to
the
pendancy
of
any
criminal
investigation
or
prosecution,
and
without
regard
to
the
pendancy
of
an
administrative
proceeding
for
possible
remission
of
mitigation
of
the
forfeiture.
and
if
there
was
some
improper
delay
in
bringing
the
action,
whether
the
remedy
was
to
return
the
money
to
the
claimant
despite
the
fact
that
she
was
not
injured
in
any
way
by
the
delay.
now,
in
order
to
place
this
issue
in
context
for
the
court
i'd
like
to
describe
briefly
the
customs
forfeiture
procedures.
after
an
item
is
seized,
there
is
a
prompt
post-seizure
notice
given
to
the...
any
person
who
customs
is
aware
has...
may
have
an
interest
in
the
item.
this
notice
advises
them
that
they
are
allowed
60
days
to
file
an
administrative
petition
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
for
remission
or
mitigation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
customs
employs
the...
the
bank
secrecy
act
itself
has
no
procedural
provisions,
and
they
employ
the
general
customs
provisions
for
the
administrative
remission
process.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
i
think
this
case
is
reflective
of
a
general
problem
that
we
have
had
with
forfeitures
being
barred
on
account
of
alleged
unconstitutional
delay.
there
are
some
attributes
which
i'll
get
to
later
of
the
currency
statute
which
make
this,
i
think,
a
particularly
strong
case
for
the
government;
but
i
will
come
to
those.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
think
there
are
any
material
differences,
yes.
now,
the
claimants,
as
i
say,
are
allowed
60
days
to
file
a
petition
for
remission
or
mitigation,
and
it's
quite
clear
from
the
statute
that
the
decision
whether
to
grant
remission
or
to
mitigate
the
penalty
involved
in
a
forfeiture
is
within
the
essentially
unfetterd
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
or
his
delegatee.
now,
if
an
administration
petition
is
filed,
the
practice
is
not
to
file
a
judicial
forfeiture
action
until
the
administrative
petition
is
decided.
if
no
petition
is
filed,
then
the
practice
normally
is
to
refer
the
matter
promptly
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
judicial
action.
now,
i
should
point
out
that
under
the
current
statutes,
the
judicial
action
is
required
only
where
the
value
of
the
object
to
be
forfeited
exceeds
$10,000.
at
the
time
of
this
seizure
it
was
$5,000,
i
believe,
or
$2,500.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
the
claimant
asserted
that
she
was
not
aware
of
her
obligation
to
declare
the
money,
because
she
believed
that
only
money
that
had
been
acquired
abroad
would
have
to
be
declared.
i
think
that
was
the
main
reason
that
she
gave.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i...
i...
actually
the
appendix
does
not
contain
the
letter,
and
i
have
not
read
the
letter
of
remission;
so
that
is
my
understanding
as
to
what
her
principal
justification
was.
but
my
colleague
can
perhaps
fill
that
in.
in
any
event,
if
the
matter
involved
is
worth
less
than
$10,000,
it's
disposed
of
administratively
unless
the
claimant
posts
a
bond
for
cost
to
obtain
a
judicial
proceeding.
if
it's
worth
more
than
$10,000,
a
judicial
action
is
filed.
now,
also
the
pendancy
of
a
criminal
investigation
or
a
criminal
prosecution
will
ordinarily
delay
both
the
decision
on
the
remission
petition
and
the
filing
of
the
judicial
forfeiture
action.
another
point
that
i
think
is
pertinent
is
that
once
the
case
is
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
civil
in
rem
forfeiture
proceedings,
there
is
no
further
processing
or
entertaining
by
customs
of
an
application
for
remission
or
mitigation.
now,
in
most
cases
the
jurisdiction
to
entertain
such
application
shifts
to
the
department
of
justice,
to
the
attorney
general;
and
under
the
regulations,
the
attorney
general's
standards
for
granting
relief
are
much
stricter,
he
is
much
less
generous
in
granting
relief
than
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
after
there
has
been
a
judicial
forfeiture
proceeding.
in
the
case
of
currency
seizures
it
is
not
absolutely
clear
and
it
is
not
settled
whether
the
attorney
general
would
have
jurisdiction
or
whether
it
would
stay
with
the
secretary
of
treasury
for
a
mitigation
petition
because
of
the
wording
of
the
particular
statute;
but
it's
not
material
to
this
case.
let
me
also
say
a
word
about
the
substantive
standards
for
currency
forfeitures.
31
u.s.c.
1102...
and
i
am
told
this
has
been
recently
recodified,
and
i
don't
have
the
section
number...
requires
only
two
things:
that
there
has
been
transportation
in
or
out
of
the
united
states
of
currency
or
monetary
instruments
in
excess
of
$5,000,
and
that
they
have
not
been
declared.
any
currency
so
transported
and
not
declared
is
forfeitable.
there
is
no
requirement
for
a
civil
forfeiture
that
the
person
knew
or
understood
that
he
or
she
was
under
a
duty
to
make
this
report.
there
may
be
a
requirement
that
they
had
to
know
that
they
were
in
fact
carrying
the
money
on
their
person,
but
that's
not
in
question
in
this
case.
now,
this
is
in
contrast
to
the
criminal
prosecution
for
this
violation
which
would
have
an
element
of
willfulness
which
the
lower
courts
have
construed
to
require
knowledge
of
the
reporting
requirement.
let
me
go
briefly
through
the
procedural
chronology
of
this
case.
the
seizure
occurred
on
september
10th.
a
remission
petition
was
filed
on
september
28th
of
1975,
and
on
october
20th
the
case
was
assigned
to
a
customs
agent
for
investigation.
between
october
1975
and
april
1976
her
investigation
largely
focused
on
whether
the
money
that
was
being
transported
by
the
claimant
and
was
not
declared
was
being
used
as
part
of
some
criminal
activity.
this,
i
am
told,
is
a
standard
practice
in
currency
seizure
cases,
and
one
of
the
reasons
this,
apart
from
the
fact
that
there
is
commonly
such
an
association
and
the
discovery
of
the
money
may
be
a
lead
to
uncover
other
criminal
activity,
is
that
the
decision
whether
to
prosecute
as
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony
may
depend
on
whether
the
money
was
being
transported
in
connection
with
some
other
criminal
activity,
in
which
case
a
felony
is
involved.
in
may
of
1976
the
case
was
referred
for
prosecution
to
the
united
states
attorney.
an
indictment
was
returned
on
june
15th
of
1976,
and
it
contained
both
a
misdemeanor
count
charging
the
failure
to
declare
the
currency
and
a
felony
count
for
false
statements
to
the
customs
officer
denying
the
possession
of
$5,000
during
the
interrogation.
the
trial
was
held
in
december
of
1976,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
the
jury
convicted
respondent
or
claimant
of
the
false
statement
counts
and
acquitted
on
the
felony
transportation...
on
the
misdemeanor
currency
transportation
count.
subsequently
on
her
appeal
the
false
statement
counts
were
reversed
because
of
inadvertent
leaving
of
the
court
file
in
the
jury
room.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
1001,
18
u.s.c.
1001.
now,
following
this,
approximately
three
months
after
the
verdict
in
the
criminal
case
the
remission
petition
was
denied,
and
the
case
was
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
a
judicial
forfeiture
action
which
was
filed
on
march
22nd,
1977,
approximately
18
months
after
the
original
seizure.
in
january
of
1978
the
district
court
entered
its
judgment
upholding
the
forfeiture
and
holding
that
the
delay
in
instituting
the
forfeiture
proceeding
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
somewhat
over
three
years
later
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
appeal,
held
that
the
government
took
too
long
in
filing
the
judicial
forfeiture
action.
their
holding
is
summarized
at
page
4a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
and
the
court
said,
"the
administrative
or
criminal
investigations
cannot
justify
the
government's
delay
when
the
necessary
elements
for
a
forfeiture
were
established
at
the
time
of
the
seizure.
"
and
then
went
on
to
hold
that
prejudice
is
irrelevant
to
the
claim,
and
without
regard
to
prejudice
the
claimant
is
entitled
to
a
return
of
the
property.
now,
in
order
to
sustain
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
claimant
must
persuade
the
court
to
find
in
its
favor
on
three
issues,
each
of
three
issues.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
it's
considerably
higher.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
they
have...
they
have
a...
they
have
a
bivens
action
possibly
against
the
collector
of
the
property.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
no,
i
don't
believe
there
is
a
statute--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--they
may...
they
may
suffer
an
injury
as
a
result
of
the
delay.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
may
have
a
bivens-type
claim,
although
that
has
its
own
difficulties.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
should
say
that
under--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
section
2680(c)
of
title
28,
which
is
a
federal
tort
claims
act
provision,
seems
to
bar
any
claim
for
delay...
for
damages
due
to
a
delay
in
connection
with
a
customs
seizure.
congress
decided
as
a
matter
of
policy
not
to
permit
it.
as
far
as
the
tucker
act
was
concerned,
that
was
an
issue
that
was
involved
in
the
hatzlatch
case.
the
court
did
not
decide
it,
and
i
have
serious
doubts
whether
there
would
be
a
tucker
act
action.
it
would
have
to
be
based
on
some
implied
contract.
i
should
say
that
under
the
department
of
justice's
procedures,
any
adverse
decision
in
one
of
these
forfeiture
cases
is
supposed
to
be
reported
to
the
solicitor
general's
office
for
a
decision
whether
or
not
to
appeal.
and
i,
apart
from
this
delay
issue
that
is
before
the
court
today,
the
due
process
issue,
i
don't
see
more
than
half
a
dozen
a
year.
now,
they
may
not
all
be
reported
to
me,
but
i
think
the
incidence
is
slight.
in
any
event,
in
order
to
sustain
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
first
thing
that
claimant
must
convince
you
of
is
that
there
exists
a
general
due
process
requirement
of
prompt
filing
of
a
judicial
action
following
a
seizure
of
goods
for
forfeiture.
secondly,
they
must
persuade
you
that
due
process
does
not
allow
the
government
to
defer
such
a
filing
on
account
of
the
pendancy
of
a
criminal
investigation
or
prosecution
or
an
administrative
petition
for
remission
or
mitigation.
and
thirdly,
they
must
persuade
you
that
the
proper
remedy
for
any
violation
of
due
process
involved
in
failing
to
file
promptly
enough
is
automatic
denial
of
the
forfeiture,
wholly
without
regard
to
whether
the
claimant
suffered
any
injury
whatsoever
by
virtue
of
the
impermissible
delay.
i'd
like
to
first
make
a
couple
of
preliminary
observations.
the
first
one
is
apparently
a
somewhat
old-fashioned
idea
that's
gone
out
of
favor
with
some
of
the
lower
courts,
and
that
is
the
statute
of
limitations
that
congress
enacted
governing
the
time
within
which
actions
of
this
sort
must
be
brought,
which
is
five
years.
now,
the
second
thing,
turning
to
this
case
in
particular--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it's
been
largely
ignored
in
numerous
cases.
i
think
not
with
this
court
because
in
the
lovasco
case,
for
instance,
the
court
reminded
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
the
principal
protection
with
regard
to
delay
in
the
institution
of
judicial
proceedings.
but
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
the
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
could
wait...
it's
clear
that
the
statute
of
limitations
contemplates
the
possibility
or
the
likelihood
that
the
property
will
have
been
seized
because
it's
five
years
from
the
date
of
discovery
of
the
offense.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
if...
we...
we
make
the
point
in
our
brief
that
if
you
were
to
analogize
the
seizure
to
the
arrest
of
the
person
and
apply
the
speedy
trial
analysis...
which
i
assume
if
you
could
meet
the
speedy
trial
test
you
would
also
comply
with
due
process
requirements...
that
the
claimant
would
not
prevail
in
this
case
under
the
four
factor
speedy
trial
analysis;
because
while
the
length
of
the
delay
arguably
would
satisfy
the
requirements,
she
could
not...
there
are
good
reasons
for
the
delay.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
is
no
prejudice;
and
there
never
was
a
demand
for
the
filing
of
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
part
of
our
argument.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
going
to
try
to
work
it
on
in
response
to
questions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that's...
we...
we
do
concede
that
there...
that
the
claimant,
even
though
retrospectively
title
passed
to
the
government,
at
least
at
the
time
of
the
seizure,
in
our
view,
we
do
concede
that
in
approaching
this
case
the
court
should
recognize
the
existence
of
a
property
interest
that
requires
some
due
process.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
a
meaningful
time.
and--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it
is
our
argument
that
in
general
if
their
delay
in
instituting
the
action
is
not
motivated
by
some
invidious
attempt
to
gain
a
tactical
advantage
that
due
process
is
satisfied
by
a
hearing
within
the
statute
of
limitations,
taking
into
account
the
other
remedies
that
are
available
to
a
person
whose
property
has
been
seized
if
they
wish
to
secure
an
earlier
hearing
on
certain
aspects
of
the
matter.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
think
that
is
a
very
bad
idea
that
is--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
would
be
possible
in
most
of
these
cases
to
file
a
complaint
rather
rapidly,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
costs
associated
with
that...
a
lot
of
costs,
in
our
view.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
now
you're...
you're
in
an
area
that
i
don't
know
very
much
about
which
is
tax
liens.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
right.
not
contraband
per
se.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
do
provide...
i'm
not
sure
in
terms
of
filing
something
in
court
for
the
reasons
that
i
will
get
into
in
my
argument.
i
think
you're
talking
about
approximately
50,000
noncontraband
seizures
by
customs
alone
very
year.
that's
not
counting
dea
and
atf
and
irs.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
the
same
rules
i
think
would
apply
if
we
seized
an
automobile
or
if
we
seized
merchandise
that's
being
brought
into
the
country
and
there's
some
customs
violation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
non...
the
nondeclaration
of
the
money
is
the
forfeitable
act.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
difference
in
terms
of...
the
same
claim
has
been
made
in
cases,
not
just
in
currency
cases
but--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--in
cases
where
automobiles
have
been
seized
or
other
merchandise
that's
been
brought
in
and
improperly
declared
has
been
seized.
and...
and
you
are
talking
about
a...
a
true
inundation
in
the
courts
of
what
we
say
are
essentially
meaningless
action
if
all
you're
going
to
do
is
file
the
suit
but
nothing
is
going
to
happen
with
it
because
there
has
to
be
more
investigation
and
because
there's
a
criminal
case
possibly
pending
in
some
portion
of
these
matters.
you
will
also
cut
off
the
only
right
that
is
useful
or
important
to
99.9
percent
of
people
who
are
involved
with
one
of
these
seizures,
which
is
the
right
to
petition
for
administrative
relief
from
the
secretary,
because
once
we
file
in
court,
the
administrative
relief
is
no
longer
available.
the
whole
system
is
designed
to
try
to
channel
these
claims
into
the
administrative
process
if
possible,
and
only
if
that
fails
to
produce
a
settlement
that's
satisfactory
to
the
parties
is
the
judicial
action--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
don't
believe
there
has
been
a
statutory
restriction,
but
it
is
an
administrative
policy
which
i
think
reflects--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--hmmmm?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
could
be
changed,
but...
but...
you
see,
what
happens
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
that
customs
can't
afford
to
conduct
the
administrative
proceedings
prior
to
the
judicial
proceeding,
so
it
will
have
to
go
forward
right
away
with
the
judicial
suit.
and
the
whole
part
of
the
purpose
of
congress
in
having
the
administrative
remedy
is
to
settle
these
cases,
and
something
like
three-quarters
of
the
cases
are
settled
with
a
remission
or
mitigation
that's
acceptable
to
the
claimant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
no.
our
position
is
that
a
forfeiture
action
must
be
brought
within
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
can't...
this
has
never
happened,
but
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
am
certain...
i
am
certain
that
they
would
have
a
remedy
in
that
situation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
they
have
a
remedy
even
before
the
five
years
if
there's
an
unreasonable
delay
in
bringing
the
forfeiture
action,
which
is
the
equitable
action
under
slocum
against
mayberry.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
would
because
the
forfeiture
proceeding
would
be
instituted
and
judgment
would
be
rendered
for
the
claimant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
on
the
grounds
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
the
property
would
be
ordered
returned.
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
the
property
was
held
for
five
years
and
no
judicial
action...
no
settlement
was
reached
and
no
judicial
action
was
filed
that
the
claimant
would
be
able
to...
upon
establishing
their
standing
they're
entitled
to
the
property
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i...
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
is.
i'm
sure
we
can't,
and
i'm
sure
that
there
would
be
a
due
process
objection.
whether
there
would
be
a
sovereign
immunity
problem
in
terms
of
a
remedy
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
but
that's
pretty
far...
i
don't
see
that
as
a
factor
that
ought
to
influence
the
decision
on
this
case.
now,
let
me
point
out
that
the
claimant
in
this
case
has
never
asked
to
have
a
judicial
proceeding
brought,
and
she
had
good
reasons
for
not
asking
because
the
judicial
proceeding
would
have
been
an
open
and
shut,
cut
and
dried
case.
she
would
have
lost;
she
had
no
defense.
her
explanations,
her
excuses
for
her
behavior
are
things
that
could
be
considered
in
the
administrative
remission
proceeding,
but
would
not
avail
her
in
the
least
in
court.
now,
this
is
generally
true
in
all
of
these
forfeiture
delay
cases
that
i
have
seen.
the
last
thing
the
claimant
wants
is
the
prompt
filing
of
a
judicial
action.
they
just
want
to
complain
after
the...
if
remission
has
been
denied
that
the
action
hasn't
been
prompt
enough
at
a
point
where
the
filing
of
the
action
can
no
longer
hurt
them
or
it's
actually
occurred.
i
wanted
to
clarify
one
other
point
before
i
got
into
more
substantive
matters,
and
that
is
there's
been
some
discussion
about
the
difference
in
the
meaning
of
forfeiture
statutes
that
say
"shall
be
forfeited"
and
"subject
to
forfeiture".
and
just
yesterday
it
came
to
my
attention
that
there
is
a
house
and
a
senate
report
that
you
should
look
at
which
explain
the
view
of
congress
in
1935
at
least,
that
the
"subject
to
forfeiture"
language
means
the
title
vests
in
the
united
states
for
the
purposes
of
this
relation
back
doctrine
at
the
time
of
the
seizure,
whereas
"shall
be
forfeited"
means
that
title
vests
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
in
either
case
there
would
be
no
difference
for
this
purpose
of
the
present
case.
this
is
h.r.
report
868,
74th
congress,
first
session,
page
11;
and
senate
report
1036,
74th
congress,
first
session,
page
15.
i
see
my
time
is
running
short.
i
just
want
to
make
the
point
that
due
process
requires
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
a
meaningful
time,
and
in
deciding
whether
the
prompt
filing
of
a
judicial
action
is
necessary
to
provide
such
an
opportunity,
you
do
have
to
look
at
what
the
options
are
that
are
available
to
the
rare
claimant
who
might
actually
want
the
prompt
filing
of
a
judicial
action.
first
of
all,
he
cannot
file
or
withdraw
his
administrative
remission
petition
which
will
normally
produce
the
prompt
judicial
filing.
secondly,
if
he
claims
that
the
seizure
itself
was
unlawful,
the
rule
41(e)
remedy
for
return
of
property
is
available.
now,
this
is
significant
because
the
class
of
cases
that
we're
talking
about
here
in
terms
of
assessing
the
risk
of
error
in
determining
what
process
is
due
is
the
class
of
cases
in
which
the
items
were
seized
with
probable
cause
to
believe
that
they
were
subject
to
forfeiture.
in
that
class
of
cases
the
risk
of
error
is
very
slight.
this
is
especially
true
in
these
currency
cases,
because
all
you
need
to
prove
is
events
that
happened
right
there
in
front
of
the
customs
inspector:
the
discovery
of
the
money
and
the
fact
of
nondeclaration.
so
the
risk
of
error
in
this
class
of
cases
is
very
small.
finally,
there
is
the
equitable
action.
i
think
i
should
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
on
this
question
of
remedy,
not
even
fuentes
v.
shevin
on
which
my
colleague
relies,
even
though
it's
quite
distinguishable,
provides
that
the
creditor's
rights
are
extinguished.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
not
sure
that...
i'm
not
sure
that
barker
is...
is
an
analogous
situation
for
purposes
of
remedy.
i
mean
it's--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes,
definitely.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
think
there...
i
think
there
the
proper
analogy
is
to
carey
v.
piphus.
that
is,
prejudice
is
an
element
except
in
the
barker
situation
where
there
is
an
explicit
constitutional
provision
on
the
speedy...
on
speedy
trial.
here
we're
talking
about
due
process,
and
the
court
has
said
that
in
the
absence
of
prejudice,
you
may
be
entitled
to
nominal
damages
because
there
is
a
desire
and
there
is
an
interest
in
adhering
to
fair
process
even
if
you're
not
prejudiced
by
it.
but
it's
crystal
clear
in
this
case.
in
fact,
this
remedy
is
exactly
backwards.
it's
a
little
bit
like
the
exclusionary
rule.
for
people
whose
property
should
not
be
forfeited...
that
is,
people
who...
who've
been
injured
by
the
delay,
they
get
nothing
out
of
this
remedy
because
they're
going
to
get
their
property
back
anyway.
the
only
people
who
get
anything
out
of
this
remedy
are
people
to
whom
the
delay
made
no
difference
except
to
defer
the
date
on
which
title
to
property
was
quieted
in
the
united
states.
now,
this
doesn't
make
very
much
sense
to
me.
now,
with
respect
to
section
1103
which
my
colleague
mentioned
for
the
first
time
today,
i
am
advised
that
that
section
is
a
section
that
deals
with
the
situation
where
the
discovery
of
the
illegal
transportation
of
the
currency
occurs
after
it's
too
late
to
seize
it,
but
that
in
cases
where
the
currency
is
seized,
that
section
has
no
application.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
oh,
yes.
his
suggestion
about
rule
54(b),
which
is
something
else
that
has
not
been
briefed,
and
i
have
not
looked
at
the
rule;
but
i
will
say
that
i
think
that
applies
only
where
there
is
a
forfeiture
action,
and
we
are
talking
about
a
case
of--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
this
is
not...
the
rule
41(e)
motion
is
not
a
civil
forfeiture
proceeding.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
rule
41(e)
motion
is
brought
to
the
time.
that
is,
in
the
case
in
which
the
marshall
walks
up
and
takes
his
wallet
from
him
would
be
no--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--not
at
all.
the
motion--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no.
the
motion
is
a
motion
that
is
filed
under
the
rules.
it
is
not
part
of
either...
it
is
not
part
of
any
other
case.
if
there...
a
criminal
case--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--hmmm?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
an
independent
proceeding,
i
believe.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that's
why...
that's
why
the
need
for
a
prompt
judicial
filing,
which
is
in
fact
suicidal
for
the
interests
of
the
claimant,
is
very
much
reduced
because
there
is
probable
cause
in
these
cases.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
there's
probable
cause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
so
the
class
of...
when
we...
when
we
are
making
the
due
process
inquiry,
whether
a
meaningful...
what
the
risk
of
error
is
in
failing
to
provide
a
prompt
judicial
forfeiture
action
as
opposed
to
a
deferred
one,
we
must--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--by
the...
yes.
or
the
possible--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--existence
of
an
affirmative
defense.
but
we're
talking
about
a
class
of
cases
in
which
the
risk
is
inherently
very
low
that
the
seizure
has
been
improper
or
the
forfeit--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
no,
no,
no.
no.
it's
not
10
or
5
percent
of
50,000.
it's
10
or
5...
it--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--of
the
25,000
cases,
about
two-thirds
are
settled.
of
the
remaining
6,000
or
7,000,
the
vast
majority
are
defaulted
when
we
file
them.
so
that
80
percent
figure
related
to
some
number--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--of
a
few
hundred
litigated
cases.
and
i
think
it's
more
like
one-tenth
of
one
percent.
