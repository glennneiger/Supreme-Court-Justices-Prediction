mr.
frey,
isn't
there
a
sort
of
a
piece
of
paper
that
could
be
filed
at
the
same
time
that
the
person
is
taken
into
custody
which
would
protect
the
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
is
possible,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
know
of
one
case
in
which
all
they
did,
they
just
filed
a
jeopardy
assessment
against
the
guy.
he
was
going
out
of
the
country.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
mean
i'm
just
wondering
about
if
you
seize
contraband,
that's
one
thing,
but
this
is
good,
solid
money
and
it's
not
contraband.
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
that
it's
over
$5,000.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i'm
wondering
if
the
government,
accepting
all
of
your...
what
you
say
as
being
true,
and
it
is...
why
there
couldn't
be
some
kind
of
thing...
if
you
needed
congress,
congress
could
give
it...
of
filing
a
piece
of
paper
that
would
block
this
off.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
money.
i'm
just
talking
about
money
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there's
a
lot
of
difference
when
you
seize
an
automobile
because
of
dope.
the
automobile
wasn't
the
dope,
but
the
money
is
the
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
money
is
the
crime
itself.
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you.
mr.
sherman--
--mr.
sherman,
all
this
time
you
were
writing
letters
could
you
have
filed
any
legal
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
a
very
simple...
could
you
or
could
you
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
most
legal
action
costs
money.
my
question
was
could
you
have
filed
a
legal
action
of
any
kind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
explain
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
said
you
delayed.
well,
didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
weren't
you
getting
the...
trying
to
get
the
customs
people
to
decide
your
case--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--without
spending
any
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
litigating.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
lulled
you...
they
lulled
you
into
giving
up
your
rights.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn't
you
go
to
law
school
to
prevent
people
from
lulling
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
government
says
they're
going
to
do
your
work
for
you,
you
don't
have
to
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
i
amend
my
question.
did
you
try
to
file
any
legal
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wouldn't
that
have
been...
shouldn't
that
have
been
her
answer?
yes,
i
have
more
than
$5,000,
but
i--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--i
didn't
say
anything
about
the
customs
form.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
that
she
should
have
said...
you
know,
it's
to
answer
the
truth,
the
whole
truth.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
she
was
answering
the
whole
truth.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
she
believed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
what
you
believe.
