mr.
victor
sherman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
question,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
due
process
clause
requires
a
prompt
post-seizure
hearing
and
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statute
of
limitation
is
the
only
limitation
of
the
government,
first
of
all,
19
u.s.c.
section
1621,
which
is
the
applicable
statute
of
limitations,
says
that
the
action
must
be
instituted
within
five
years
after
the
time
when
the
alleged
offense
was
discovered.
obviously,
if
the
government
believes
that
a
crime
has
occurred
or
that
a
forfeiture
is
appropriate
and
they
do
not
seize
the
person's
property,
they
have
five
years
within
to
bring
an
action.
that's
the
normal
statute
of
limitations.
however,
when
they
have
seized
the
property...
and
this
court
has
already
indicated
in
the
pierson
yacht
case
in
1974
that
once
an
item
has
been
seized
under
a
forfeiture
proceeding,
there
is
an
emergency
reason
not
to
comply
with
the
normal
rule
that
before
seizure
you
are
to
give
a
person
notice
and
a
hearing.
it's
only
in
the
rare
instance
where
because
of
other
governmental
interest
such
as
in
the
pierson
yacht
case
or
potentially
in
this
case
that
you
can
seize
the
property
and
merely
postpone
the
hearing.
and
once
the
event
has
happened,
there
is
no
reason
to
delay
the
hearing
beyond
the
requirement
of
the
due
process
prompt
hearing
requirement.
and
i
believe
the
government
has
cited
no
cases,
and
there
are
no
cases,
either
at
the
district
court,
court
of
appeals,
or
supreme
court
that
says
the
government
has
up
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
rule
has
always
been
that
once
the
property
is
seized,
you
are
required
to
give
a
prompt
post-seizure
hearing.
the
government
has--
mr.
victor
sherman
--certainly,
first
of
all,
since
the
government
concedes
that
the
remission
petitions
are
to
be
decided
under
19
u.s.c.,
sections
1602,
1603
and
1604
have
been
interpreted
by
the
various
courts
to
apply
to
this
situation.
1602
talks
about
once
a
seizure
has
occurred
the
seizing
officer
is
to
immediately
make
a
report
to
the
appropriate
custom
officer;
there's
to
be
an
immediate
investigation
and
an
appraisal
of
the
property
under
1603,
and
then
the
matter
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney's
office;
and
1604
to
be
a
filing
of
the
action
forthwith.
the
court
has
indicated
in
the
first
amendment
area
in
the
thirty-seven
photographs
case
that
in
order
to
save
the
facial
constitutionality
of
the
section
in
that
particular
case,
it
read
into
this
statute
certain
time
limitations...
14
days
for
a
preliminary
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
the
particular
film
in
question--
mr.
victor
sherman
--no.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
in
other
areas
the
court
has
said
that
promptitude
or
promptness
is
required.
and
i'm
saying
in
this
particular
area
the
due
process
clause
also
is
applicable.
although
this
is
a
fifth
amendment
area
and
not
a
first
amendment
area,
and
potentially
the
time
restraints
may
be
somewhat
different
depending
upon
the
interest
involved,
certainly
the
principle
that
something
has
to
be
done
within
a
prompt
period
of
time
and
that
the
due
process
clause
has
a
role
to
play
in
that
determination
is
applicable
in
this
case.
and
i
believe
that
any
argument
that
says
that
once
the
government
seizes
an
individual's
property
and
can
sit
on
it
for
five
years
and
has
to
do
nothing
is
foreign
to
every
single
court
from
the
magna
carta
onward
who
has
even
discussed
this
point.
and
the
reason
the
government
is
unable
to
cite
any
cases
that
says
they
can
wait
five
years
is
because
there
are
no
cases
because
everybody
assumes--
mr.
victor
sherman
--and
this
is
where
the
facts
become
extremely
important,
and
that's
why
the
government's
continued
assertion
that
the
petitioner
did
not
want
a
prompt
hearing
is
totally
belied
by
the
record.
first
of
all,
if
the
court
will
note
that
the
day
after
the
seizure
occurred,
i
wrote
a
letter
on
behalf
of
the
claimant
indicating
the
reason
the
funds
were
not
reported
and
the
mistake
of
fact
which
the
petitioner
or
the
claimant
was
under
due
to
the
confusing
customs
form
given
to
her
on
the
airplane;
and
that
we
wanted
a
prompt
hearing
of
the
matter;
and
that
we
wanted
to
know
the
reasons
if
there
was
to
be
a
denial
of
the
petition,
and
the
standard
under
which
the
secretary
was
making
the
decision.
and
consistently
thereafter
i
wrote
letters
to
customs
asking
for
reasons
if
there
was
going
to
be
denial
and
to
handle
the
matter
promptly.
now,
at
all
times
customs
agent
janet
pompeo,
in
this
case,
related
to
me
that
this
was
a
civil
forfeiture
proceeding
and
never
gave
any
indication
whatsoever
there
was
going
to
be
a
criminal
case.
and
this
is
where
the
bad
faith
of
the
government
comes
in.
not
only
did
she
indicate
to
me
that--
mr.
victor
sherman
--it's
in
the
appendix,
your
honor.
at
the
civil
trial
janet
pompeo
testified
that
she
went
so
far
as
to
obtain
an
interview
of
my
client
under
the
guise
of
a
petition
for
remission
when
she
had
already
made
the
decision
in
october
within
a
few
days
after
receiving
the
information
regarding
the
seizure
that
she
was
going
to
file
a
criminal
case.
and
the
only
reason
there
was
delay
in
this
case
was
not
to
investigate
the
remission
petition,
but
it
was
to
try
to
gather
further
information
under
the
guise
of
investigating
the
remission
petition
to
file
the
more
serious
felony
of
1059.
mr.
victor
sherman
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
customs
cannot
investigate
both
at
the
same--
mr.
victor
sherman
--i'm
not
saying...
it's
bad
faith
to
tell
the
attorney
for
a
claimant
that
you
are
seriously
considering
a
remission
petition,
get
an
interview
of
the
claimant,
when
at
the
same
time
all
you're
trying
to
do
is
getting...
is
get
an
incriminating
statement
against
the
claimant
to
use
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
and
also
induce
the
claimant
not
to
ask
for
the
forfeiture,
judicial
forfeiture
proceedings
because
you're
telling
the
claimant
we
are
honestly
going
to
consider
your
remission
petition.
if
janet
pompeo
would
have
told
me
i
am
investigating
a
criminal
case--
mr.
victor
sherman
--yes,
it
is
all
in
the
record.
mr.
victor
sherman
yes,
we
did.
mr.
victor
sherman
the
entire
civil
forfeiture
matter
is
in
the
appendix.
mr.
victor
sherman
i
believe
it's
at
pages
53
to...
59
to
61
and
63
to
64
in
the
appendix.
mr.
victor
sherman
could
i
have?
mr.
victor
sherman
well,
first
of
all,
the
government
makes
a
big
point
of--
mr.
victor
sherman
--if
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
expense
of
filing
an
action
to
force
them
to
file
a
forfeiture
action.
mr.
victor
sherman
under
that
broad
question
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
victor
sherman
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
victor
sherman
because--
mr.
victor
sherman
--no,
i
did
not.
mr.
victor
sherman
what
i
was--
mr.
victor
sherman
--what
i
was
trying
to
do--
mr.
victor
sherman
--what
i
was
trying
to
do
was
take
advantage
of
what
the
government
was
offering
me
and
telling
me
they
were
going
to
treat
in
good
faith;
that
is,
the
remission
procedure.
the
remission
procedures
are
intended
to
settle
these
matters
fast
and
efficiently--
mr.
victor
sherman
--more
than
lulled.
they
affirmatively
made
representation--
mr.
victor
sherman
--i
also
learned
in
law
school
and...
that
if
the
government
tells
you
something
that
they
are
doing
that
you
supposedly
can
rely
upon
what
they're
telling
you,
and
if
they're
lying
to
you
that
you
have
a
recourse
afterwards.
mr.
victor
sherman
i'm
not
saying
that
they
were
telling
me
they
were
doing
their
work
for
me.
they
were
telling
me
if
you
submit
a
petition
for
remission
in
good
faith,
we
will
consider
it
in
good
faith;
and
i
relied
upon
that
representation
to
me.
mr.
victor
sherman
that's
correct.
mr.
victor
sherman
no.
mr.
victor
sherman
well,
the
government
dismissed...
it
was
on
the
government
motion
that
the
criminal
case
was
dismissed.
by
the
way--
mr.
victor
sherman
--well,
i
believe
that
although
the
words
"bad
faith"
were
not
used,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
absolutely
no
justification
for
the
government
delaying
in
this
case.
mr.
victor
sherman
well,
again,
justice
o'connor,
they
did
not
use
the
word
18-month
delay
in
filing
the
forfeiture
action
without
any
valid
justification
whatsoever
certainly
be
read--
mr.
victor
sherman
--again,
they
did
not
use
the
words
"bad
faith".
justice
marshall,
as
far
as
bringing
another
type
of
action,
the
government
claims
that
we
could
have
filed
a
41(e)
action
in
order
to
test
the
legality
or
the
propriety
of
the
seizure.
first
of
all,
that
would
not
go
to
whether
or
not
the
money
should
be
forfeited,
but
also
there's
federal
criminal
rule
procedure
54(b)(5)
which
states
that
you
may
not
use
a
41(e)
action
in
a
forfeiture
case.
so
there's
another
section
that
specifically
says
we
can't
even
file
a
41(e)
motion.
also,
under
the
snidiak--
mr.
victor
sherman
--no,
i
did
not
try
to
file
any
legal
action.
also,
under
snidiak
and
fuentes
the
court
has
specifically
held
and
indicated
that
it's
not
up
to
the
persons
whose
property
has
been
seized
in
order
to
go
to
court
to
try
to
file
or
force
the
issue;
it's
the
person
who
has
seized
the
property
that
has
the
primary
responsibility
in
the
action.
in
this
particular
case
it's
the
government
that
seizes
an
individual's
property.
they
set
up
a
procedure
which
says
if
you
can
show
that
there's
been
an
innocent
mistake
of
fact,
which
we
tried
to
show
in
this
case,
makes
it
available
to
the
claimant,
as
they
made
it
available
in
this
case,
and
we
take
advantage
of
that
procedure.
and
then
rather
than
considering
the
petition...
at
no
time
was
this
petition
ever
considered
as
part
of
the
remission
procedures.
janet
pompeo
had
made
the
decision
within
a
day
or
two
of
investigating
the
matter
that
she
was
going
to
file
a
criminal
case,
and
she
never
intended
to
consider
the
remission
petition.
all
she
did
is
delay
for
this
period
of
what
turned
out
to
be
18
months
for
the
purpose
of
proceeding
with
the
criminal
case.
and
then
she
told
the
district
director
don't
decide
the
remission
petition
until
after
the
criminal
case
is
over,
because
that
would
have
a
bearing
on
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
forfeiture
to
see
if
we
can
get
a
conviction
under
1102.
and
this
is
where
the
government
attempted
to
take
advantage,
tactical
advantage,
which
is
mentioned
in
footnote
17
of
lovasco,
because
if
they
would
have
gotten
a
criminal
conviction
under
1101...
excuse
me...
they
would
have
utilized
that
as
a
forfeiture
under
1102,
and
then
the
person
was
acquitted.
mr.
victor
sherman
your...
justice
o'connor,
the
government
concedes
that
if
i
would
have
filed
no
petition
whatsoever
within
a
60-day
period
that
very
soon
thereafter
they
would
have
been
required
to
file
a
judicial
forfeiture
action.
so
if
i
would
have
done
nothing,
if
i
would
have
sat
back
rather
than
writing
the
letter
the
day
after
and
filing
the
petition
some
10
days
later,
and
done
nothing,
some
60
days
and
a
little--
mr.
victor
sherman
--yes.
it
is...
it's
stated
in
their
brief
that
if
no
petition--
mr.
victor
sherman
--may
i
have
my
associate
look
for
it
while
i--
mr.
victor
sherman
--the...
if
you
file
no
petition
for
remission,
then
customs
has
nothing
to
consider,
so
all
they
do
is
have
the
money.
the
next
step
in
the
process
would
be
the
filing
of
the
judicial
forfeiture
action.
so
it's
only
the
filing
of
the
forfeiture
petition--
mr.
victor
sherman
--first
of
all,
the
criminal
prosecution
took
place...
the
indictment
was
returned
some
nine
months
after
the
seizure
of
the
funds,
so
there
might
be
a
question
right
there:
is
nine
months
considered
prompt?
and
if
the
purpose
of
waiting
nine
months
to
file
the
forfeiture
action...
in
the
particular
indictment
in
this
case
the
government
indicted
mary
vasquez
on
1001
and
1101
and
also
asked
for
the
forfeiture
of
the
funds.
so
if
you
want
to
consider
the
indictment
an
attempt
to
forfeit
the
funds,
they
asked
for
the
forfeiture
of
the
funds
which
the
person
was
acquitted
on
that
particular
charge.
now,
when
the
matter
ended
up
going
to
the
jury,
the
government
realized
that
they
could
not
actually
get
forfeiture
in
the
criminal
proceedings
and
would
have
to
wait
for
the
civil
action.
but
by
originally
putting
in
the
indictment
that
they
were
attempting
to
forfeit
the
funds
and
then
losing
on
that
issue--
mr.
victor
sherman
--she
was
convicted
of
1001
which
eventually
was
overturned
on
the
appeal.
mr.
victor
sherman
yes,
but--
mr.
victor
sherman
--well,
yes,
because
the
court
file
which
showed
a
prior
criminal
record
was
put
into
the
jury
room,
and
so
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
were
obviously
influenced
by
extrinsic
matters,
and
so
they
reversed
the
conviction.
so
you
can't
very
well
say
that
the
jury
found
her
guilty
based
upon
appropriate
evidence,
and
now
since
they
didn't
retry
her
say
that
they
were
convinced
of
her
guilt.
mr.
victor
sherman
well,
they
acquitted
her.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
an
unfair
comment
in
a
sense
to
make
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
if
we
want
to
carry
it
one
step
further,
they
did
give
her
a
clean
bill
of
health
as
to
whether
or
not
she
filed
the
1101
reporting
form.
they
acquitted
her.
mr.
victor
sherman
well,
if
you
want
to
say
that
they
did
not
give
a
clean
bill
of
health
because
they
were
influenced
by
improper
evidence
put
into
the
jury
room,
no,
they
did
not
give
her
a
clean
bill
of
health.
but
if
the
government
is
waiting
until
a
jury
makes
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
appropriate
form
was
filed,
and
they
give
her
a
clean
bill
of
health
and
say
not
guilty,
and
the
government
has
used
as
a
tactical
advantage
this
time
period
in
which
to
try
to
get
a
jury
to
make
that
determination,
then
they
lose
and
they
say
well,
it's
totally
irrelevant
to
us
and
then
bring
a
forfeiture
action,
they
are
taking
two
bites
of
the
apple,
heads,
we
win,
tails,
you
lose.
if
we
get
a
conviction
of
1101,
we'll
forfeit
the
money;
and
if
we
don't,
we'll
just
do
it
another
way.
and
that
was
the
tactical
advantage
referred
to
in
lovasco
that
we're
referring
to.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
there's
another
section.
one
of
the
major
arguments
the
government
makes
in
this
case,
well,
if
we
rule
in
favor
of
the
claimant
in
this
matter,
we're
out
of
luck;
there's
nothing
we
can
do.
that
is
totally
not
true.
there's
a
section
31,
u.s.c.
section
1103,
and
also
the
recent
ninth
circuit
case
decided
in
october
of
1982,
which
is
295
ivory
carvings,
that
says
besides
forfeiting
the
item,
another
alternative
is
for
the
secretary
to
assess
a
fine
against
the
offender
and
assess
that
fine
giving
credit
for
any
amount
of...
the
amount
of
the
forfeited
item.
so
if,
for
instance,
the
government
delays
in
bringing
the
forfeiture
action
and
loses
the
ability
to
forfeit
that
particular
item,
they
can
obtain
the
same
result
by
filing
an
action
under
31
u.s.c.
1103
getting
a
judgment
for
the
amount
that
they
believe
is
owed
to
the
government
and
collect
that
way.
and
that
only
has
to
be
done
within
the
five
year
statute
of
limitations.
but
if
the
court
permits
or
reverses
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
in
this
case,
they're
going
to
say
to
the
government
you
can
take
somebody's
property,
they
can
deal
with
you
in
an
honest
fashion,
they
can
ask
for
prompt
action
within
the
remission
procedures,
they
can
rely
upon
your
representation
the
remission
procedures
are
what
you
are
considering,
they
can
hold
that
property
for
an
indefinite
period
up
to
five
years,
and
there's
nothing
you
can
do
to
complain
about
it,
unless
you
want
to
take
the
expense
of
filing,
which
seems
to
be
the
only
potential
remedy,
an
action
against
the
government
saying
file
a
forfeiture
action
against
me.
and
why
at
that
time
the
government
would
then
make
the
same
arguments:
well,
we
don't
have
to
file
a
forfeiture
action
against
you
because
there's
a
pending
criminal
matter.
i
would
doubt
very
much
if
any
members
of
this
audience,
or
as
obviously
by
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals,
would
countenance
the
ability
of
the
government
to
seize
somebody's
property
and
hold
it
for
five
years
and
give
them
no
relief.
and
that's
exactly
the
position
that
the
government
is
arguing
in
this
particular
matter.
mr.
victor
sherman
eighteen
months.
mr.
victor
sherman
it's
also
a
lot
of
a
ways
off
from
a
common
understanding
of
the
word
"promptly".
mr.
victor
sherman
lovasco,
i
think
as
justice
white--
mr.
victor
sherman
--lovasco
was
a
pre-indictment
situation,
and
the
court,
to
give
a
little
summary,
has
basically
said
nobody
has
a
right
to
be
arrested
or
indicted;
that
basically
it's
a
prosecutorial
discretionary
decision
as
to
when
to
proceed
with
a
criminal
case.
and
since
nobody
is
under
any
deprivation
of
any
kind,
we
can't
say
that
you
have
to
file
a
case
within
a
particular
period
of
time.
and
in
order
to
show
a
violation
under
lovasco,
you
must
show
actual
prejudice,
because
until
you
can
show
actual
prejudice,
the
government
has
done
nothing
to
deprive
you
of
anything.
if
we
were
going
to
use
an
analogy
to
any
of
the
prior
decisions,
obviously
the
barker
case,
barker
v.
wingo,
is
more
applicable
because
we
can
analogize
the
seizure
of
property
to
the
seizure
of
a
person.
in
actuality,
forfeiture
sections
are
considered
in
rem
proceedings,
so
it's
an
arrest
of
the
property
as
an
arrest
of
the
person.
so
once
there's
been
a
deprivation,
as
in
this
case,
now
the
mechanism
similar
to
a
speedy
trial
application
in
barker
takes
place.
and
in
barker
there
were
four
specific
tests
to
determine
whether
or
not
something
was
speedy,
which
is
the
same
kind
of
determination
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
that
should
be
made
as
to
whether
something
is
prompt...
a
balancing
of
factors.
and
the
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
has
balanced
those
factors
and
said,
for
instance...
and
the
government
again
concedes
in
its
brief
that
the
18-month
period...
and
i
believe
i
can
give
you
the
page
citation...
is
on
its
face
not
prompt
or
sufficiently
stale
to
trigger
the
other
decisions
or
the
other
factors
in
barker
v.
wingo.
so
the
first
factor,
of
course,
is
the
length
of
delay.
the
second
factor
is
whether
or
not
there
is
any
reason
for
the
delay.
in
this
particular
case
the
court
of
appeals
found
as
a
matter
of
law
that
there
were
no
reasons
for
the
delay
because
the
delay
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
ostensible
purpose
for
seizing
the
funds
which
was
the
forfeiture
action,
the
remission
petition
procedure.
mr.
victor
sherman
i'm
not
saying
that
i
have
no
obligation
to
know
prejudice.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
it's
very
important...
and
that's
why
i
mention
1103,
this
prejudice
question.
the
reason
prejudice
is
so
important
in
the
criminal
area
is
because
if
the
government
loses,
it's
the
end
of
the
matter;
the
person
is
free.
now,
first
we
have
the
higher
potential
society
responsibility
to
prosecute
criminals,
and
when
we
start
letting
people
that
may
have
committed
crimes
go,
we
want
to
be
very
careful
that
there's
been
a
substantial
violation
of
constitutional
right
before
we
do
that.
second
of
all,
as
i've
already
indicated,
in
the
criminal
area
if
the
government
loses,
it
loses.
there's
nothing
further
they
can
do.
in
the
forfeiture
area
if
the
government
loses
under
this
procedure,
they
haven't...
they
have
other
remedies.
they
can
bring
a
criminal
action,
which
they
did
in
this
case,
or
they
can
sue
under
1103.
so
their
prejudice,
if
we're
balancing
prejudice
to
the
government
versus
prejudice
to
the
claimant,
the
government
suffers
almost
no
prejudice
whatsoever
if
they
don't
bring
the
forfeiture
action
promptly
because
they
have
another
alternative.
mr.
victor
sherman
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there
was
prejudice
in
the
sense
of
being
able
to
put
on
the
defense
of
the
case.
i
would
say
that--
mr.
victor
sherman
--yes,
there
was
a
defense.
the
defense
in
this
particular
case...
and
i
think
it
was
the
first
question
your
honor
asked...
was
whether
or
not
at
a
forfeiture
trial
there
would
have
been
any
defense,
and
the
defense
in
this
particular
case
was
that
the
form
that
mary
vasquez
was
required
to
fill
out
upon
the
return
into
the
united
states
mentioned
property
acquired
abroad,
and
she--
mr.
victor
sherman
--not
at
all.
mary
vasquez
has
testified
that
the
reason,
this
was
just
a
safe
hiding
place
for
the
funds
rather
than
carrying
it
in
her
pocket
or
her
purse
where
it
could
be
taken
by
some
third
party.
she
had
nothing
to
hide.
the
form
said
property
acquired
abroad.
she
understood
it
to
mean
that
in
order
to
be
required
to...
to...
to
report
the
funds,
you
had
to
acquire
the
property
abroad.
mr.
victor
sherman
sherman.
mr.
victor
sherman
by
way
of
stipulated
testimony
as
to
what
claimant
would
say,
yes.
but
again,
it's
not
after
the
fact
that
judge
curtis
happened
to
have
made
that
particular
determination.
the
question
was
did
she
have
anything
to
litigate,
and
the
fact
that
judge
curtis
did
not
believe
her
did
not
mean
that
she
did
not
have
something
to
litigate.
mr.
victor
sherman
well,
your
honor,
i
would
quote
back
to
this
court
many
cases
that
say
that
to
one
who
protests
against
the
taking
of
his
property
without
due
process
of
law
it
is
no
answer
to
say
in
his
particular
case
due
process
of
law
would
have
led
to
the
same
result
because
he
had
no
defense
upon
the
merits.
that's
basically
what
your
honor
is
saying
is
if
you
can't
win,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
your
due
process
violations
are
violated?
let's
apply
that
to
the
criminal
area.
mr.
victor
sherman
well,
then
why...
then
why
have
fourth
amendment,
fifth
amendment,
sixth
amendment?
if
the
person
is
guilty
and
along
the
way
we
can
convict
him
any
way
we
want
and
it
doesn't
matter,
then
what's
the
point
of
the
procedure
of
due
process?
mr.
victor
sherman
not
gives
up...
your
honor,
if
i'm
sitting
in
this
courtroom
and
one
of
your
marshall
comes
over
to
me
and
takes
my
wallet
under
some
theory,
and
takes
my
wallet
and
takes
it
into
his
office
and
holds
it
for
five
years,
and
you're
saying
to
me
i
have
no
rights
to
try
to
get
that
property
back.
mr.
victor
sherman
well,
you're
accepting
the
fact
that
she
had
no
justifiable
belief
in
what
she
was
doing.
mr.
victor
sherman
well,
again,
i
would
just
quote
to
you
that
the
end
result
is
not
the
determining
factor
as
to
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
violation
of
due
process.
and
i
think
what
your
honor
is
saying
is
that
if
there's
been,
let's
say,
a
miranda
violation,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
the
person
is
guilty.
that's
why
we
have
procedural
due
process
rules.
mr.
victor
sherman
that's
correct.
mr.
victor
sherman
yes.
that
was
an
undisputed
fact.
mr.
victor
sherman
no.
what
i
am
saying,
first
of
all,
the
forfeiture
in
this
case
was
not
based
upon
a
1001
violation.
mr.
victor
sherman
no.
you
can
make
the
false
statement
to
the
customs
officer,
and
then
if
she
would
have...
if
she
would
have
been
given
the
form
and
filled
out
the
form,
they
could
not
forfeit
these
funds.
it's
the
failure
to
follow
the
reporting
form
which
triggers
the
forfeiture,
not
the
false
statement.
but
second
of
all--
mr.
victor
sherman
--no.
mr.
victor
sherman
if
you
lie
to
a
custom
officer
and
fill
out
the
forfeiture
form,
they
can't...
and
i
mean,
excuse
me,
fill
out
the
appropriate
reporting
form,
they
can't
forfeit
your
property.
that's
the
statutory
scheme.
there
is
no
statutory
scheme
that
if
you
lie
to
a
customs
officer
they
can
take
all
of
your
property,
whatever
you
have
on
you.
it's
the...
the
bank
reporting
act
is
not...
it's
not
illegal
to
bring
in
more
than
$5,000.
the
only
illegality
is
failure
to
file
the
form.
mr.
victor
sherman
but...
but,
your
honor--
mr.
victor
sherman
--that's
not
a
question
as
to
whether
the
seizure--
mr.
victor
sherman
--i'm
sorry.
but,
again,
the
reason
she
reported
it
that
way,
because
she
had
already
been
informed
through
the
customs
declaration
form
that
she
understood
it
to
mean
that
she
only
had
to
tell
them
she
had
more
than
$5,000
if
she
acquired
the
money
abroad.
mr.
victor
sherman
well,
that's
what...
you
know,
your
honor,
that's
why
people
make
mistakes,
because
they
don't
understand
certain
customs
forms,
and
in
fact,
she
was
acquitted
on
that
very
charge.
mr.
victor
sherman
yes,
that
should
have
been
her
answer.
mr.
victor
sherman
well,
she
believed
that
she
was
answering
truthfully.
mr.
victor
sherman
that's
what
she
believed.
mr.
victor
sherman
that's
what
she
believed.
mr.
victor
sherman
well,
that's
what
the
jury
believed.
mr.
victor
sherman
no,
i
don't...
i
don't
accept...
i
accept
that
she
did
in
fact
lose--
mr.
victor
sherman
--on
the
merits
issue,
but
i'm
saying--
mr.
victor
sherman
--well,
i'm
asking
you
to
review
it
in
the
sense
that
if
we
assume
that
the
remission
petition
are
subject
to
due
process
requirements,
which
i
believe
they
are,
that...
and
no
reason
was
given
in
the
remission--
mr.
victor
sherman
--exactly.
mr.
victor
sherman
yes.
i'm
asking
that
even
a
guilty
person
is
entitled
to
procedural
due
process.
and
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
agree
with
that,
as
i'm
sure
they
do.
mr.
victor
sherman
well,
barker
v.
wingo
says
that
even
though
it
may
be
a
harsh
result
for
purposes
of
the
government
to
dismiss
the
action,
that's
the
only
remedy.
and
i
will
quote
from
barker.
it
says,
"such
a
remedy
is
more
exclusionary
than
an
exclusionary
rule
or
reversal
for
a
new
trial,
but
it
is
the
only
possible
remedy.
"
right
from
this
court's
own
mouth
that
is
the
only
possible
remedy.
