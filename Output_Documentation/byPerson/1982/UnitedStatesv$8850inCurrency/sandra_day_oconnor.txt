justice
sandra

o'connor
well,
mr.
frey--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
property
interest
that
was
seized
that
triggers
some
due
process
right
to
a
hearing
at
some
reasonable
or
meaningful
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it's
your
argument
that
the
statute
of
limitations
provides
for
the
meaningful
time,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
to
resolve
this
case,
do
we,
because
the
government
didn't
wait
that
long,
and
you
don't
have
to
resolve
that.
what
you
have
to
resolve
here
is
whether
the
delay,
which
involved
waiting
for
the
resolution
of
the
criminal
action,
in
effect,
did
amount
to
a
meaningful
time
for
the
provision
of
the
judicial
proceeding.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
sherman,
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
found
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
government,
did
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
found
that
the
failure
was
unjustified
but
did
not
find
bad
faith,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
just
found
it
was
too
long,
that's
all,
not
bad
faith,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
sherman,
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
it's
pretty
logical
for
the
government
agents,
for
the
treasury
department
to
investigate
in
connection
with
a
remission
petition
whether
there's
some
underlying
criminal
activity
afoot;
that
that's
an
appropriate
thing
to
do
in
deciding
whether
some
administrative
petition
to
return
the
money
is
appropriate
to
grant.
in
this
case
the
government
decided
this
woman
had
violated
the
law,
had
committed
felonies,
and
ultimately
decided
to
prosecute.
now,
why
is
that
unreasonable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
a
government
concession.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
show
me
where
in
the
brief
that's
stated.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
surely.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
the
next
step
would
be
the
filing
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
more
serious
offense,
right?
a
false
statement.
