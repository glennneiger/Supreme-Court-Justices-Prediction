what
is
the
statute
governing
the...
the
statutory
section
governing
the
false
statement
count?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how...
how
about
an
action
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
or
under
the
tucker
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
that's
gone
out
of
favor
with
some
of
the
lower
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
a
constitutional
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
not
suggesting
that
any
first
amendment
interest
is
involved
in
a
certain
amount
of
money,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
record,
counsel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
can't
they
investigate
both
at
the
same
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it's
bad
faith
to
do
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
is
this
all
in
the
record?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
cite
appropriate
places
in
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
a
record
citation?
did
you
say
it's
in
the
appendix?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
a
page
citation
to
the
testimony
that
you're
relying
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
was
she
convicted
of?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
jury
was
satisfied
of
her
guilt
on
that,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they...
they
didn't
really
give
her
a
clean
bill
of
health
either.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
didn't
give
her
a
clean
bill
of
health
as
being
guilty
of
making
a
material
false
statement
to
the
government.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr....
mr.--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--sherman,
19(a)
where
the...
judge
curtis'
findings
of
law,
he
says,
"the
claimant
violated
13
u.s.c.
1101
(a)
when
she
executed
a
customs
form
stating
that
she
was
not
carrying
currency.
"
"furthermore,
she
repeatedly
failed
to
make
a
proper
declaration
during
a
primary
oral
examination.
"
now,
were
those
contested
issues
at
the
trial
of
the
forfeiture
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
she
had
nothing
to
gain
by
being
tried
earlier.
she
just
would
have
lost
earlier.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
come
right
down...
when
you
come
right
down
to
it,
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
saying
any
way
we
want.
there's
no
suggestion
that
you
were
prejudiced
in
your
effort
to
prepare
your
case
for
the
forfeiture
proceeding
before
judge
curtis.
you're
saying
that
just
in
the
abstract
without
any
showing
of
prejudice
the
fact
that
it
came
to
trial
maybe
six,
eight,
ten
months
after
you
think
it
should
have
should
mean
the
government
just
gives
up
the
forfeiture.
now,
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
really
addressing
that
situation.
i'm
addressing
the
kind
of
situation
where
your
client
was
on
a
plane
from
vancouver
to
los
angeles
carrying
concealed
currency
on
her
person,
fails
to
declare
it.
i
think
that
puts
the
case
in
a
little
bit
different
light
than
your
example.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
accepting
judge
curtis'
findings
of
fact
made
after
a
full
evidentiary
hearing,
i
take
it.
