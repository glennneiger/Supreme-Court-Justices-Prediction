justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
the
government
has
already
seized
the
property
and
is
holding
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
so
you've...
it's
sort
of
like
you've
started
the
case,
in
a
sense.
you've
got
the
money,
and
you
just
aren't
give
it
back.
and
you
think
you
could
wait
five
years.
well,
congress
has
said
you
could
wait
five
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
could
wait
five
years
to
start
your
action,
but
that
doesn't
say
you
can
wait
five
years
to
seize
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
for
example--
justice
byron
r.
white
--there's
a
statute
of
limitations
in
criminal
cases,
too,
but
you
can't...
can't
arrest
a
person
and
then
just
wait
five
years
to
prosecute.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
part
of
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
--now
you
know
the
best
way
you
can.
you
do
concede
that
due
process
rights
are
triggered
by
a
government
seizure
of
someone's
property,
i
suppose;
to
have
a
hearing
on
the
seizure
at,
what,
a
meaningful
or
reasonable
time,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you're
also...
you're
saying
more
than
that.
entitled
to
due
process,
but
if
they
don't
get
it,
the
entire
proceeding
must
fail.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
barker?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
arguing
that
even
if
there
was
unreasonable
delay,
the
proceeding
should
not
have
been...
the
forfeiture
proceeding
should
not
have
been
dismissed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
barker?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
rule
41?
the
suggestion
was
that
it
was
wholly--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
54(b)
says
that
these
rules
do
not
apply
to
a
civil
forfeiture
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
you
would
be
filing...
the
motion
would
be
filed
in
a
civil
forfeiture
proceeding--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
would
be
in
a
criminal
cases,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
proceeding
in
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
proceeding
in
itself?
