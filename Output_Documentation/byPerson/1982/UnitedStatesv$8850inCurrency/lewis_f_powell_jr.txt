justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
counsel,
may
i
ask
a
question?
as
i
read
the
findings
of
fact,
it...
it's
stated
on
page
15a
that
it
is
further
stipulated
that
during
the
questioning,
inspector
mcculloch
asked
your
client
if
she
were
carrying
more
than
$5,000.
she
replied
in
the
negative,
and
that
question
was
repeated
three
times.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
you...
did
you
prepare
the
stipulation?
did
you
agree
to
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
and...
and
do
you
compare
that
with
somebody
coming
up
and
seizing
your
wallet
here
in
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
it
was
based
upon
an
absolutely
false
statement
made
to
a
customs
officer.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you're
saying
lying
to
a
customs
officer
is...
is
perfectly
appropriate
and--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--therefore
there
was
no...
no
one...
that
therefore
the
conduct
of
the
government
was
unlawful
at
that
time?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
oh,
i
understand
the
forfeiture
is
a
different
question,
but
we
were
talking
about
whether
or
not--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--the
initial
seizure
was
valid
by
the
government...
government.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
that...
that's
the
question
i
was
addressing.
