mr.
frey,
may
i
just
ask,
in
this
description
are
you
describing
the
procedure
under
the
bank
secrecy
act
or
other
forfeitures
as
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is...
is...
is
your
position
that
this
case
is
typical
of
all
forfeitures,
or
do
we
have
a
special
problem
under
the
bank
secrecy
act
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
generally
we
could
consider
it
pretty
much
the
same
as
say
the
seizure
of
a
boat
or
an
automobile
and
a
narcotic?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey,
before
you
get
into
your
main
argument,
may
i
ask
one
other
procedural
question?
in
your
brief
you
indicate
that
the
government
prevails
in
about
80
percent
of
these--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--cases
other
than
those
where
there's
delay
involved.
well,
whatever
the
figure
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
it's
90
percent.
but
take
the
10
percent
in
which
you
don't
prevail.
say
on
the
merits,
not
for
reasons
of
delay,
the
person
gets
the
property
back.
do
they
get
any
damages
or
any
compensation
for
the
time
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
i
mean,
is
there
any
routine
statutory
procedure
for
paying
interest
or
anything
else?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
may
have
a
lawsuit
is
what
they--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
may
have
a
bivens-type
claim,
and
that's...
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know
i
don't
understand--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--was
there
a
statutory
restriction
on
you're
continuing
to
make
the
administrative
remedy
available
after
this
suit
was
filed,
or
is
that
a
matter
of
administrative
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which...
which
could
be
changed,
i
suppose,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
could
be
changed
then
if--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
frey,
when
we
get
into
this
subject
of
alternative
remedies,
what
if...
what
if
the
government
let
the
statute
of
limitations
run,
say
five
years,
in
a
case
in
which
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
they
were
entitled
to
the
money
or
whatever
might
be
seized,
so
there
would
be
no
rule
41
remedy?
does
the
former
property
owner
have
any
remedy
to
get
his
property
back?
he
has
no
tort
claims
remedy?
can
the
government
just
keep
the
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
supposing
they
don't?
i'm
saying
supposing
they
don't
bring
it
within
the
five
years,
can
they
just
keep
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can't
conceive
of
it
happening,
but
does
the
citizen
have
a
remedy
if
that
should
happen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what...
what
would
it
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
an
action
requiring
them
to
institute
a
forfeiture
proceeding.
and
if
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run,
that
remedy
wouldn't
be
available,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
the
statute
had
run?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
in
mind
the
treasure
salvors
case
last
year.
we
had
a
problem
of
sovereign
immunity.
of
course,
there's
it's
eleventh
amendment.
i
think
the
government
has
the
same
right
to
claim
sovereign
immunity,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
the
initial
seizure
was
supported
by
probable
cause.
i
don't
know
why
you
just
can't
keep
the
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
what
i
asked.
counsel,
but
really
the
issues
before
us
don't
concern
her
guilt
or
innocence,
do
they?
we
accept
the
fact
that
she's
been...
it
doesn't
really
matter,
does
it,
on
the
forfeiture
issue?
she's
going
to
lose
on
the
merits
in
the
forfeiture
issue.
you
accept
that,
but
you
say
for
procedural
reasons--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
not
asking
us
to
review...
to
review
that
determination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
aren't
you
just
arguing
even
a
guilty
person
is
entitled
to
a
fair
trial?
that's
all
you're
arguing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
can
assume
for
purposes
of
that
argument
that
she's
"guilty"
in
the
sense
that
she
loses
on
the
merits
in
the
forfeiture
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
only
prevail
on
that
if
there's
no
probable
cause,
don't
you?
i
mean
most
of
these
cases
at
least
there'll
be
probable
cause
to
make
the
seizure
so--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
if...
i
don't
understand.
the
probable
cause
means
you
will
win
every
41(e)
motion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
assume
there
is.
then
i
would
think
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
the
risk
measured
by
the
difference
between
probable
cause
and
preponderance
whatever
that
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
clear
and
convincing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--we're
talking
about
that
small
percentage
in
which
you
ultimately
lose,
which
you
say
in
your
brief
is
20
percent
but
on
reflection
you
think
is
significantly
less.
but
we're
talking
about
maybe
10
percent
or
5
percent
of
the
forfeitures,
and
there
are
50,000
of
them;
so
we're
talking
about
4,000
or
5,000
cases--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
the
litigated
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
the
litigated
cases.
