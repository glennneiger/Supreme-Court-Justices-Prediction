against
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
no.
against
them,
though,
in...
you
wouldn't
say
it
was
a
suit
against
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
in
any
event,
you
could
get
only
prospective
recovery.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if...
if...
if...
mr.
hobbs,
if
it's
a
question
of
implying
a
damages
remedy
or
a
cause
of
action
for
damages,
then
we
are...
even
though
the
united
states
is
involved,
doesn't
it
raise
the...
generally
the
same
sort
of
questions
as
whether
other
statutes
contemplate
an
action
in
damages;
in
short,
whether
you
should...
whether
an
implied
right
to
damages
exists
under
statutes
generally?
we've
been
having,
as
you
know,
in
the
last
few
years
quite
a
succession
of
cases
with
respect
to
that
issue,
and...
and
maybe
the
law
is
in
somewhat
transition.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
that
may
be
so,
but
the
question
still
remains
did
the
congress
anticipate
a
damages
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't
whatever
test
we've
evolved
for
deciding
whether
the
statute
contemplates
a
damages
action,
whatever
that
standard
is,
why
shouldn't
it
be
applicable
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
want
to
sue
on
them.
the
government
says
they
may
sue
on
them
but
can
only
get
an
injunction.
the
question
still
remains
about
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
