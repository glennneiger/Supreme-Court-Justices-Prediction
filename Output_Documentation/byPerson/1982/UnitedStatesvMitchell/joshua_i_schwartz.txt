mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
for
a
second
time
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
former
united
states
court
of
claims
holding
that
the
united
states
is
answerable
in
money
damages
for
alleged
statutory
violations
pertaining
to
management
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
of
timber
on
allotted
lands
of
the
quinault
indian
reservation
in
the
state
of
washington.
throughout
this
litigation
several
categories
of
damages
have
been
sought
by
the
respondents
against
the
united
states.
these
include
an
alleged
shortfall
in
revenues
earned
on
the
account
of
the
respondents
owing
to
the
secretary's
failure
to
obtain
maximum
market
value
from
purchasers'
of
the
indian
timber
for
timber
sold;
the
secretary's
alleged
failure
to
manage
the
timber
on
a
sustained
yield
basis;
and
the
secretary's
alleged
failure
to
sell
some
of
the
merchantable
timber
located
on
the
indian
allotments.
in
addition,
damages
are
sought
for
the
secretary's
failure
to
develop
an
optimum
system
of
roads
in
the
logged
areas
and
for
roadbuilding
charges
deducted
from
the
revenues
earned
on
timber
sales.
and
finally,
respondents
complain
that
insufficient
interest
was
paid
or
in
some
cases
that
no
interest
was
paid
on
funds
held
by
the
secretary
on
the
account
of
the
indian
respondents.
when
this
case
first
came
before
the
court
of
claims,
that
court
held
that
section
5
of
the
general
allotment
act,
pursuant
to
which
the
forested
lands
of
the
quinault
indian
reservation
had
been
allotted,
established
a
general
trust
which
included
management
duties,
and
that
by
necessary
implication
the
remedy
of
damages
was
available
to
the
respondents
to
redress
any
mismanagement
of
the
timber
resources.
this
court
in
the
case
that
we
call
mitchell
1
reversed
that
decision
of
the
court
of
claims.
the
court
did
not
reach
the
question
whether
the
creation
of
an
express
trust
by
statute
would
itself
ground
an
action
for
damages
against
the
united
states,
because
the
court
concluded
that
the
trust
that
had
in
fact
been
created
by
the
general
allotment
act
was
not
a
general
trust
and
did
not
encompass
duties
of
management.
this
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
claims
to
provide
that
court
with
an
opportunity
to
reach
other
theories
of
recovery
advanced
by
the
respondents.
in
mitchell
2,
the
en
banc
court
of
claims,
with
judge
nichols
dissenting
this
time,
again
held
that
the
united
states
was
answerable
in
damages
in
respect
of
each
of
the
respondents'
major
claims
of
injury.
the
threshold,
the
court
refused
to
confine
the
implication
of
a
damage
remedy
against
the
united
states
to
statutes
which
provide
for
the
payment
of
money
or
which
expressly
provide
for
a
damage
remedy.
the
court
then
turned
to
the
particular
statutes
which
are
involved
here.
these
are:
25
u.s.c.
406,
407
and
466,
which
pertain
to
the
sale
of
timber
on
indian
lands;
another
group
of
statutes
in
25
u.s.c.
318(a)
and
323
through
325,
which
govern
roadbuilding
on
indian
reservations
and
the
granting
of
rights
of
way
over
indian
lands.
although
the
court
recognized
that
none
of
these
statutes
expressly
created
a
trust
duty
of
any
kind,
the
court
held
that
"a
long
continuing
doctrine
of
governmental
fiduciary
obligation
in
the
management
of
indian
property
was.
"
quote,
"infused
into
these
statutes".
and
the
court
thought
that
because
the
purpose
of
the
statutes
generally
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
indians
was
to
generate
revenue,
it
was
necessary
that
the
court
imply
a
damages
remedy
to
enforce
the
statutory
requirements.
accordingly,
the
court
held
that
recovery
in
damages
of
amounts
that
should
have
been
earned
but
were
not
earned
on
the
account
of
the
indian
beneficiaries
could
be
recovered
against
the
united
states,
and
that
similar
damages
could
be
recovered
under
the
roadbuilding
statutes.
finally,
the
court
held
that
damages
could
be
recovered
against
the
united
states
for
failure
to
pay
interest
on
respondents'
funds
held
by
the
united
states
at
a
rate
reflecting
reasonable
management
zeal
to
get
the
best
interest
rate
for
respondents.
because
of
the
substantial
importance
of
the...
of
the
doctrinal
holding
of
the
court
of
claims
and
because
of
the
substantial
amount
of
money
which
is
at
stake
in
this
case,
we
have
again
sought
this
court's
review.
it
is
our
central
submission
that
the
court
of
claims'
analysis
is
inconsistent
with
the
teaching
of
this
court
respecting
recovery
of
damages
against
the
united
states
in
that
the
decision
below
effectively
dispenses
with
the
requirement
that
congress
authorized
the
recovery
of
damages.
the
parties
appear
to
be
in
agreement
on
one
fundamental
point,
and
that
is
the
standard
for
determining
whether
a
statute
provides
for
the
recovery
of
damages
against
the
united
states
is
that
supplied
by
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
testan;
that
is,
whether
the
statute...
and
i'd
like
to
quote...
"in
itself
can
fairly
be
interpreted
as
mandating
compensation
for
the
damage
sustained.
"
at
that
point
agreement
ends
in
this
case,
and
the
question
is
what
it
means
to
fairly...
for
a
statute
to
be
fairly
interpretable
as
mandating
compensation.
in
our
own
analysis
we
start
with
the
language
of
the
pertinent
statutes.
none
of
the
statues
involved
in
this
case
makes
any
mention
of
maintenance
of
litigation
or
recovery
of
damages
against
the
united
states.
furthermore,
although
the
statutes
do
in
some
instances
refer
to
the
payment
of
money,
the
court
of
claims
did
not
suggest,
nor
does
respondent
now
suggest,
that
their
claims
arise
under
that
statutory
language.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yes,
justice
o'connor.
and,
in
fact,
we
make
the
further
point
that
because
the
statute
makes
that
clear,
it
is
to
be
assumed
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
sanction
the
recovery
of
some
other
amounts
of
money
against
the
united
states.
i
would
add
one
point
of
qualification.
the
statute
in
fact
prescribes
that
the
money
be
paid
to
the
indians
or
used
for
their
benefit,
so
that
if
the
secretary...
the
secretary
has
the
authority
to
do
other
things
with
the
money.
but
were
he
not
to
do
that,
he
would
not...
the
indians
would
be
able
to
maintain
suit,
we
suppose,
to
compel
the
funds
that
are
in
hand
to
be
disgorged.
it's
our
view
that
the
statutory
language
here
might
be
profitably
compared
with
statutes
which
have
been
regarded
as
authorizing
the
recovery
of
damages
against
the
united
states.
a
common
example
that
comes
to
mind
is
the
federal
tort
claims
act
which
specifies
that
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
respecting
provisions
of
this
title
relating
to
tort
claims
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
under
like
circumstances.
another
comparison
might
be
drawn
to
the
language
of
the
indian
claims
commission
act
which
provides
that
the
claims
commission
shall
herein
determine
all
claims
in
law
and
equity
with
respect
to
which
the
claimant
would
have
been
entitled
to
sue
in
a
court
of
the
united
states
if
the
united
states
were
sueable;
and
moreover,
all
claims
based
on
fair
and
honorable
dealings
that
are
not
recognized
by
an
existing
rule
of
law
or
equity.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
oh,
no,
there
is
such
language,
and
i
gathered
that
was
the
basis
of
justice
o'connor's
question,
with
the
one
qualification
that
i've
given.
the
statute,
if
i
may
direction
your
attention
to
page
1a
of
the
appendix.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
if
i
may
read:
"the
timber
on
any
indian
land
held
on
a
trust...
held
under
a
trust
or
other
patent
containing
restrictions
on
alienations
may
be
sold
by
the
owner
with
the
consent
of
the
secretary.
"
--i'll
skip
over
a
few
words,
if
i
may...
"and
the
proceeds
from
such
sales,
after
deductions
for
administrative
expenses,
shall
be
paid
to
the
owner
or
owners.
"
it
is
that
kind
of
provision
which
we
have
in
mind
as
likely
grounding
an
action
to
recover
monies
against
the
united
states.
and
the
existence
of
that
language,
we
submit,
suggests
that
some
other
larger
group
of
monies
that
are
not
in
hand
and
are
not
proceeds
cannot
be
recovered
against
the
united
states.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
justice
o'connor,
we
think
it
probably
would
be
held
to
be.
testan,
there
is
some
inevitable
grayness
and
fuzziness
as
to
what
is
a
mandate
for
compensation.
it
is
our
view
that
statutes
that
unequivocally
direct
payment
of
money
generally,
presumptively
or
ordinarily
would
be
understood
as
sufficiently
clear.
on
the
other
hand,
such
statutes
do
not
invariably
ground
compensation.
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
united
states
v.
erica
comes
to
mind.
although
the
court
there
didn't
reach
a
sovereign
immunity
issue
and
specified
that,
because
it
found
an
express
bar
to
recovery
of
damages,
we
would
suppose
that
the
court
could
have
couched
its
holding
in
terms
that
the
government
did
not
consent
the
recovery
of
damages.
where...
where
a
statute
provides
for
payment
of
money
without
any
qualification,
then
the
presumption
may
go
one
way.
when
there
is
no
such
provision,
for
reasons
i'd
like
to
turn
to,
we
think
the
presumption
should
be
very
strongly
the
other
way.
there's
a
fundamental
difference
that
we
believe
should
not
escape
notice
between
statutes
that
direct
payment
of
money
and
statutes
that
impose
nonmonetary
duties
upon
officers
of
the
united
states.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i'm
not
sure
what...
what
your
reference
is
to
in
the
second--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--in
that
event
it
is
our
submission...
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
difference
between
that
kind
of
statutory
provision
and
the
one
that
goes
before.
the
short
answer
is
that
we
believe
that
the
second
kind
of
duties
are
nonmonetary
duties
and
that
congress
should
be
understood
to
have
intended
a
nonmonetary
specific
injunctive
or
declaratory
remedy.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
for
certain
items.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
we
think
that
it
is
in
the
nature
of
the
sovereign
immunity
analysis
that
very
particular
attention
should
be
paid
to
what
items
congress
contemplated
to
be
paid
without
further
authority
and
what
items
not.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
perhaps
i
should
spend
a
minute
on
that.
i
think
this
is
a
bit
of
semantic
confusion.
i
don't
really
want
to
take
much
time
unless
it
concerns
the
court.
it
is
our
understanding
that
the
court
has
used
somewhat
inconsistent
language
from
time
to
time
in
describing
the
tucker
act.
we
believe
that
the
cases
such
as
united
states
v.
sherwood
and
last
term's
decision
in
army
and
air
force
exchange
v.
sheehan
refer
to
the
tucker
act
as
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
cases
such
as
mitchell
1
and
testan
say
that
it
is
not,
that
it
is
merely
jurisdictional;
that
some
other
statute
must
provide
the
waiver.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
doesn't
matter
how
you
put
the
point.
clearly,
the
tucker
act
is
sufficient
unto
itself
as
a
basis
for
recovering
damages
on
a
contract
claim.
that's...
the
tucker
act
didn't
do
that.
the
tucker
act
didn't
do
anything
at
all.
on
the
other
hand,
we
suppose...
the
congress
and
the
legislative
history
is
consistent...
that
congress
did
not
consent
to
recovery
of
damages
on
any
claim
that
might
be
tied
to
some
statute
which
imposes
a
nonmonetary
duty.
and
the
way
that
has
been
rationalized
and
expressed
by
the
court
in
testan
and
mitchell
is
that
what...
congress
provided
jurisdiction
to
entertain
claims
where
the
act
of
congress
was
of
a
particular
character.
now,
one
can
say
that
as
to
the
statutory
claims,
the
tucker
act
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
that
the
other
statute
must
provide
the
right
of
action,
or
one
can
say
that
the
tucker
act
is
merely
a
conditional
waiver
as
to
the
statutory
claims,
or
one
can
say,
as
testan
appears
to
have
literally
said,
that
it's
not
a
waiver
at
all.
but
the
point
to
us
seems
to
be
exactly
the
same
any
way
you
read
it:
either
the
rule
is
that
a
waiver...
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
are
to
be
strictly
construed
according
to
their
terms,
or
else
the
rule
is
that
an
unequivocal
sovereign
immunity
is
required.
in
either
event,
the
other
statute
in
addition
to
the
tucker
act
must
make
clear
that
congress
contemplated
the
award
of
damages.
and
this
is
sort
of
a
semantic
embroglio
we
may
have
created
by
ourselves.
but
we
don't
think
the
legal
result--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--gracious
of
you
to
say
so,
justice
rehnquist.
we
do
think...
i'd
like
to
explain
why
the
provisions
of
statutes
such
as
section
406
that
create
nonmonetary
obligations
for
federal
officers
have
a
different
standing
in
the
sovereign
immunity
analysis,
if
i
may
use
that
shorthand,
than
statutes
that
contemplate
the
payment
of
money.
statutes
that
prescribe
the
payment
of
money
create
an
obligation
for
the
united
states.
statues
that
direct
federal
officers
to
take
certain
action
prescribe
duties
for
officers.
and
as
to
those
statutes,
absent
some
comment
by
congress,
some
indication
that
congress
appreciated
that
federal
officers
might
not
perform
their
duties,
and
that
the
united
states
treasury
might
thereby
be
impacted
for...
by
an
action
for
damages,
we
think
the
contrary
presumption
is
the
correct
one,
that
congress
expected
that
federal
officers
would
do
what
they
were
told,
and
that
if
they
did
not,
the
remedy
available
was
an
action
to
compel
the
performance
of
those
statutory
duties.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
against...
in
their
official
capacity,
though,
not
an
act...
we're
not
talking
gibbons
action
here.
what
we
have
in
mind
is--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--i...
i...
technically
i
think
not,
justice
white,
although
since
the
1976,
i
think,
amendment
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
name
the
defendant
the
united
states
or
you
name
the
defendant
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
that's
right.
and
it
is
our
submission
that
the
remedy
that
was
available
to
enforce
these
nonmonetary
duties
was
that
kind
of
remedy.
and
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
we
believe
that
is
the
appropriate
kind
of
remedy.
congress,
in
prescribing
nonmonetary
duties,
has
never
shown
that
it
appreciated
that
the
treasury
would
be
held
accountable
for
the...
for
the
misfeasance
of
federal
officers.
of
course,
in
the
context
of
this
case
i
use
those
terms
because
that
is
what
is
alleged,
and
it's
never
been
determined
whether
there
has
in
fact
been
any
statutory
violation.
the...
there
is
another
critical
point
here.
the
respondents
argue
that
the
value
to
them
of
performance
of
these
duties
which
we
call
nonmonetary
was
financial;
and
i
assume
that
that
is
perfectly
accurate.
but
that
in
itself
is
not
sufficient
to
indicate
that
congress
contemplated
the
payment
of
money
from
the
united
states
treasury
or
sanctioned
that
recovery
as
is
required
unless
there
is
evidence
that
congress
contemplated
what
would
happen
if
the
federal
officers
did
not
perform
their
statutory
duties
and
were
allowed
to
go
uncorrected
in
that
course.
in
this
case...
i
would
also
add
that
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
testan
cannot
be
distinguished
in
the
manner
which
is
implicitly
suggested
by
this
line
of
argument,
because
the
same
argument
could
have
been
made
in
testan,
and
if
i
read
the
court's
opinion
correctly,
essentially
the
same
argument
was
made
in
testan.
the
statute
there
involved
was
the
classification
act
which
established
criteria
for
the
grading
of
federal
employees.
the
value
to
a
particular
federal
employee
such
as
the
respondent,
herman
testan,
of
such
a
statute
was
monetary.
it
came
through
the
provision
of
yet
another
statute
which
said
that
if
you're
rated
at
gs-12
as
a
government
attorney,
your
salary
is
thus
and
so.
the
value
to
herman
testan,
therefore,
of
compliance
with
the
classification
act
in
his
case
was
monetary
as
well.
but
the
court
refused
to
telescope
the
nonmonetary
predicate
duty
into
the
monetary
duty
which
lay
behind
it.
the
court
instead
said
you
may
have
an
action
for
injunctive
relief,
and
if
you
were
reclassified
as
a
gs-14
attorney,
then
you
may
recovery
the
salary
to
which
you
would
be
entitled;
but
congress
has
not
authorized
the
recovery
of
damages
for
your
misclassification.
the
same
analysis
applies
here.
an
injunctive
action
may
be
available
to
compel
the
secretary
to
alter
his
practices,
if
in
fact
they're
improper,
in
the
oversight
of
sales
of
indian
timber.
and
if
that
is
done,
the
provision
which
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
requiring
the
payment
of
proceeds
will
then
round
an
action
to
make
sure
that
those
proceeds
are
paid.
the
two
steps
cannot
be
divided,
and
that
we
take
to
be
the
teaching
of
testan.
in
a
sense
this
case
stands
on
a...
this
case
is
an
easier
case,
we
would
submit,
for
the
government
than
testan,
because
in
testan
if
the
nonmonetary
duty
of
proper
classification
were
properly
performed,
the
higher
salary
that
would
be
owing
to
the
respondent
would
come
from
the
treasury.
in
this
case
had
the
government
performed
the
nonmonetary
duties
that
it
is
alleged
to
have
improperly
performed
in
a
more
suitable
manner,
the
extra
sums
earned
would
have
come
from
those
who
would
have
paid
for
the
timber.
therefore,
there
is
no
reason
at
all
to
expect
that
congress
contemplated
the
united
states
would
be
liable.
the
two
kinds
of
obligations
are
far
less
fungible
than
those
involved
in
testan.
the
respondents
would
substitute
the
answerability
of
the
united
states
in
money
damages
for
sums
that
should
have
been
garnered
from
a
contractor
who
purchased
indian
timber.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
an
additional
reason
why
it
should
not
be
inferred
from
a
silent
legislative
record
and
a
silent
statute
that
congress
contemplated
the
recovery
of
money
damages
for...
where
proceeds
were
not
actually
earned.
i'd
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
actual
statutes
involved
here.
there
are
quite
a
number,
and
frankly,
this
matter
is
not
terribly
susceptible
of
oral
presentation,
and
i'll
likely
rely
heavily
on
the
briefs.
it
is
important
to
know,
however,
that
there
are
a
number
of
separate
statutes
involved
here
for
different
kinds
of
claims,
that
they
can't
be
grouped
all
together.
it's
also
interesting,
so
far
as
i
can
discern,
the
respondent
has
not
even
answered
our
argument
respecting
some
of
the
statutory
claims.
i
don't
find
any
arguments
made
in
defense
of
the
court
of
claims'
holding
that
section
318(a),
which
authorizes
the
appropriation
of
funds
for
building
of
roads
on
indian
reservations,
somehow
grounds
an
action
for
recovery
of
damages.
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
very
serious
thing
if
a
routine
authorization
statute
allowed
individuals
who
might
be
benefitted
if
the
appropriations
were
made,
would
ground
an
action
for
recovery
of
damages.
the
main
statute
at
issue
here,
however,
is
25
u.s.c.
406(a),
which
governs
the
sale
of
timber
on
indian
allotments.
the
first
thing
to
observe,
of
course,
is
that
there
is
no
mention
of
damages
in
the
statute
itself.
and
as
i've
said,
while
there
is
a
mention
of
an
obligation
to
pay
out
certain
monies,
the
proceeds
of
the
sale,
there
is
no
mention
of
any
duty
to
pay
out
any
other
monies.
the
other
duties
are
nonmonetary.
a
few
other
points
are
relevant
to
considering
whether
congress
could
have
intended
that
the
united
states
be
answerable
in
money
damages
under
this
statute.
the
first
is
that
until
1964,
the
statute
was
a
rather
bare
instrument.
it's
reproduced
in
footnote
3
at
page
3
of
our
brief.
and
until
1964
the
statute
simply
said
the
timber
on
any
indian
allotment
held
under
a
trust
or
other
patent
containing
restrictions
on
alienations
may
be
sold
by
the
allottee
with
the
consent
of
the
secretary,
and
the
proceeds
shall
be
paid
over.
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
how
congress
could
have
thought
that
that
statute
imposed
any...
created
any
opportunity
to
recover
any
money
other
than
the
actual
proceeds.
there
was
no
standard
that
the
secretary
was
directed
to
adhere
to.
there
were
no
criteria
for
sale.
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
under
the
statute
prior
to
1964,
as
today,
the
power
to
sell
timber
actually
was
given
to
the
individual
and
not
to
the
secretary.
it
was
the
secretary's
consent.
the
secretary
was
to
act
as
a
constraining
influence.
now,
the
government
does
not
deny,
as
this
court's
opinion
in
white
mountain
apache
v.
bracker
makes
clear,
that
it...
the
secretary
actually
undertakes
a
rather
comprehensive
role.
but
that
role
in
this
case,
as
respondent
has
made
quite
clear,
was
made
possible
not
by
the
statute
alone,
but
by
the
powers
of
attorney
which
were
signed
here
which
granted
the
allottee's
authority
to
sell
timber
to
the
secretary.
and
as
we've
argued
in
the
briefs,
those
powers
of
attorney
don't
themselves
ground
an
action
for
damages.
what
is
relevant
is
that
congress,
which
talked
in
terms
of
the
allottee
selling
timber,
could
scarcely
have
contemplated
that
the
government
would
be
liable
for
the
secretary's
mismanagement.
the...
i
think
i'd
prefer
to
leave
the
balance
of
the
detailed
statutory
argument
for
the
briefs.
the
key
point
is
that
rather
than
engage
in
anything
like
the
kind
of
analysis
that
we've
laid
out,
which
we
submit
is
the
reanalysis
required
by
the
decision
in
testan,
the
court
of
claims
proceeded
by
an
entirely
different
route.
it
built
on...
it
proceeded
by
three
extrapolations
of
the
existing
law,
each
of
which
we
submit
to
be
erroneous.
the
first
was
the
idea
that
a
statute
need
not
prescribe
either
the
recoverability
of
damages
or
require
the
payment
of
money
to
ground
an
action
for
compensation.
the
second
is
that
even
though
the
statues
involved
here
do
not
in
term
speak
of
trust
duties,
that
indian...
statutes
governing
the
management
of
indian
property
generally
should
be
understood
to
have
a
trust
character.
and
third
is
it
is
necessary
that...
that
given
the
existence
of
a
trust
duty
that
damages
be
recoverable.
it
may
well
be,
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
suggest,
that
statutes
governing
the
responsibilities
of
the
government
pertaining
to
indian
property
are
to
be
read
with
a
fiduciary
clause,
but
none
of
those
decisions
suggest
that
that
is
in
itself
a
sufficient
basis
for
recovery
of
damages.
and
it
is
a
very
serious
matter,
we
submit,
when
the
court
of
claims
suggest
that
even
though
congress
did
not
address
itself
to
a
trust
character
of
the
duty
that
that
trust
character
of
the
duty
is
somehow
sufficient
to
ground
an
action
for
damages.
if
congress
had
said
the
secretary
shall
hold
these
lands
in
trust
and
pursuant
to
that
trust
manage
these
lands
and
assure
that
the
highest
return
is
earned
for
the
allottees
pursuant
to
prudent
and
professional
forestry
management
practices,
that
might
be
a
different
matter.
but
congress
has
not
created
such
a
trust,
and
even
if
it
had,
the
question
would
still
remain
did
congress
foresee
the
recoverability
of
damages.
the
effect
of
the
court
of
claims
reasoning
interpolating
trust
duties,
and
further,
interpolating
a
damages
remedy
into
a
silent
statute
and
legislative
record
is
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
judicial
legislation
that
was
condemned
by
this
court's
decision
in
testan,
as
well
as
the
private
right
of
action
cases
that
we've
referred
to
which
we
think
provide
a
cognate
line
of
authority.
the
court
in
testan
said
that
it
should
not
tamper
with
established
principles
because
it
was
thought
that
they
should
be
made
responsive
to
a
particular
conception
of
enlightened
government
policy.
and
that,
we
submit,
is
exactly
what
the
court
of
claims
has
done
here.
it
is
for
congress
and
for
congress
alone
to
prescribe
the
availability
of
damages
against
the
united
states.
for
these
reasons
and
the
reasons
stated
in
our
written
decisions,
the
decision
of
the
former
court
of
claims
should
be
reversed.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice,
two
points.
the
first
is
that
respondents'
argument
proceeds
as
though
the
statutes
in
issue
here
expressly
declared
a
trust.
that
is
not
the
case.
their
text
does
not
support
that
reading.
and
as
i
understand
respondents'
argument,
the
view
is
that
these
statutes
expanded
the
general
allotment
act
trust,
but
none
of
the
statutes
refer
to
the
general
allotment
act;
and
it's
clear
that
all
of
the
statutes
apply
to
properties
that
are
not
subject
to
the
general
allotment
act.
the
statutes
are
either
adequate
on
their
own
or
not
to
create
a
damage
remedy,
and
there's
simply
no
nexus
that's
apparent
from
the
statutory
language
or
the
legislative
history
that
would
suggest
this
was
a
congressional
attempt
to
expand
the
general
allotment
act
duties.
if
i
can
return
to
the
question
of
the
relationship
between
this
and
the
private
right
of
action
cases,
we
agree
that
there
is
much
in
common
between
the
two
lines
of
analysis,
and
in
both
the
rule
is,
as
the
court
said
in
touche
ross
and
reddington,
the
ultimate
question
is
one
of
congressional
intent.
and
the
court's
refusal
in
testan
to
go
beyond
that
intent
speaks
to
the
same
kind
of
analysis.
but
we
would
add
that
the
private
right
of
action
cases
rarely
distinguish
between
damages
remedies
and
injunctive
remedies,
and
that
because
of
the
background
of
sovereign
immunity
there's
an
extra
layer
of...
an
extra
requirement
of
special
clarity
that
congress
intended
a
damages
remedy
so
that
the
showing...
the
showing
required
in
the
ordinary
private
right
of
action
cases
should
be
applied
especially
strictly
in
this
context.
