mr.
schwartz,
can
i
interrupt
a
second,
because
justice
o'connor's
question
troubles
me
also.
there's
no
such
language
in
the
statute
that
says
when
you
sell
the
timber
and
collect
some
money,
you
pay
it
over
to
the
indians,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
go
back
to
the
timber
statute
again?
i
do
have
it
in
front
of
me
now.
it
does
have
the
mandatory
language
that
you
called
our
attention
to,
the
proceeds
shall
be
paid
over.
then
later
in
the
same
paragraph
there
is
this
mandatory
language
about
what
the
secretary
shall
do
with
regard
to
administrative
expenses
and
how
he
should
sell
it.
you're
saying
that
the
second
half
of
it
doesn't
contemplate
any...
any
payment
if
he
breaches
those
duties,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
sales
of
timber
under
this
subsection
shall
be
based
upon
a
consideration
of
the
needs
and
best
interests
of
the
owner,
indian
owners
and
his
heirs.
and
say
the
secretary
says
well,
i'll
just
ignore
that
and
sell
it
for
half
of
what
i
think
i
could
get
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
they
come
in
a
statutory
provision
that
you
acknowledge
is...
does...
can
fairly
be
interpreted
as
mandating
compensation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understood
your
brief
to
take
the
position
you
really
weren't
arguing
sovereign
immunity.
you're
basically
arguing
implied
cause
of
action
theory.
