justice

marshall
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
united
states
can
be
held
liable
for
alleged
breaches
of
trust
in
connection
with
its
management
of
forest
resources
in
lands
on
an
indian
reservation.
helen
mitchell
went
out
of
his
only
interest
in
lands
on
the
quinault
indian
reservation
in
the
pacific
northwest
filed
actions
in
the
court
of
claims
seeking
to
recover
damages
from
the
united
states.
they
alleged
that
the
government
had
mismanaged
timberlands
in
the
reservation
in
violation
of
the
fiduciary
duty
that
the
united
states
owed
to
the
indians
as
trustees
under
various
federal
statutes
and
regulations.
the
court
of
claims
held
that
the
united
states
was
subject
to
suit
on
most
of
the
indian's
claims.we
granted
the
government
to
petition
the
certiorari
and
today
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims.
the
united
states
could
not
be
sued
without
its
consent.
in
this
case,
we
recognized
that
the
government
waived
its
immunity
to
be
sued
as
a
sovereign
in
the
tucker
act.
passed
in
the
19th
century,
the
tucker
act
gives
jurisdiction
to
the
court
of
claims
to
render
judgment
upon
a
wide
variety
of
claims
including
claims
found
upon
a
federal
statute
or
regulation.
we
conclude
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
that
the
statutes
and
regulations
upon
which
the
indians
rely
in
this
case
can
be
interpreted
to
require
compensation
for
damages
resulting
from
the
breach
of
the
duties
they
impose.
in
particular,
congress
has
given
the
secretary
of
the
interior
broad
responsibility
to
manage
resources
in
land
belonging
to
the
indians.
the
secretary
has
issued
broad
regulations
governing
in
the
timberlands,
grant
of
control
is
comprehensive.
where
the
federal
government
has
assumed
such
control
over
property
belonging
to
the
indians,
a
fiduciary
relationship
necessarily
arises.
moreover,
the
language
of
the
statutory
and
regulatory
provisions
involved
in
this
case
support
the
existence
of
a
trust
relationship.
because
a
trust
relationship
exist,
the
government
should
be
held
liable
for
breaches
of
its
fiduciary
duties.
unless
the
indians
can
recover
the
government
mismanagement
of
their
resources,
there
will
be
little
to
deter
federal
officials
from
violating
their
duties
and
permanent
damage
to
indian
lands
with
result.
the
united
states
is
therefore
accountable
for
its
alleged
mismanagement.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
rehnquist
and
justice
o'connor
joined.
