i
guess
you
would
concede,
wouldn't
you,
though,
that,
for
instance,
the
timber
statutes
would
mandate
that
the
government
pay
the
allottees
the
money
to
the
extent
that
it's
earned
on
the
timber?

but
the
language
of
"shall
be
paid
to
the
owner.
"
is
sufficient
in
your
view
to
constitute
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
under
testan,
is
that
right?
