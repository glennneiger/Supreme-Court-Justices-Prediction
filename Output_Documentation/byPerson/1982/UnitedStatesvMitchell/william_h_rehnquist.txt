mr.
hobbs,
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
there
is
perhaps
an
ambiguity
and
perhaps
confusion
in
nomenclature
among
our
cases
as
to
whether
you're
talking
about
the
tucker
act
as
a
simply
jurisdictional
basis
or
as
an
implied
waiver?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
just
we
who
are
confused.

government.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
would
all
be...
if
you
read
the
indian
tucker
act
that
way,
then
mitchell
was
wrongly
decided,
wasn't
it?
