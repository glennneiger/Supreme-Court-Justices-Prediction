mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
opinion
you're
going
to
write
in
this
case
will
be
the
seventh
reported
opinion
in
the
history
of
this
long
case.
the
question
now
is
simply
this:
when
the
united
states
takes
control
and
custody
of
indian
property,
in
this
case
timber,
and
sells
it
for
less
than
its
market
value,
must
the
government
make
good
that
loss,
or
is
the
indian
without
remedy
for
that
loss?
if
you
rule,
as
the
government
urges,
that
there
is
no
remedy
in
damages,
then
there
is
no
remedy
at
all.
before
turning
to
the
government's
points,
i'd
like
to
state
the
background
of
this
case
in
our
terms.
these
indians
aboriginally
used
and
occupied
the
olympic
peninsula
of
washington
and
the
area
south
of
that
which
is
an
area
covered
by
dense
forest.
in
the
1850s
the
government
made
a
treaty
with
some
of
these
indians,
and
as
to
the
rest
of
the
indians
who
refused
to
sell
their
land,
who
refused
to
sign
that
treaty,
the
government
simply
took
over
the
land
and
thereafter
treated
it
as
if
they
had
signed
the
treaty.
a
reservation
was
established
in
the
middle
of
this
aboriginal
territory
for
all
of
these
indians,
those
who
signed
the
treaty
and
those
who
did
not,
and
in
time
that
reservation
was
divided
pursuant
to
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887
into
small
80-acre
allotments.
each
indian
got
one
allotment.
all
of
this
is
well
covered,
and
it's
got
a
map
showing
aboriginal
territory
in
the
brief
we
filed
three
years
ago
when
this
case
and
this
question
were
first
before
you.
now,
each
trust
allotment
was
a
formal
statutory
express
trust
under
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887.
now,
it's
true,
as
you
said
three
years
ago,
that
nothing
in
the
general
allotment
act
said
anything
about
timber
management
duties.
that's
because
the
allotment
act
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
giving
timberland
to
indians;
they
couldn't
work
that.
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
give
them
farmland
or
grazing
land.
and
in
this
case
that
was
not
possible,
so
what
the
indians
got
was
property
that
there
was
no
way
that
they
personally
could
work
the
land.
it
was
just
a
happenstance
that
they
came
from
a
part
of
the
country
where
there
was
not
enough
farmland
to
go
around.
now,
since
this
was
trust
land,
the
indians
couldn't
sell
their
timber,
even
if
they
were
knowledgeable
about
it
and
even
if
they
wanted
to
sell
it.
congress
was
aware
of
this,
and
in
1910...
incidentally,
indians
who
own
trust
allotments
are
in
a
small
minority
nationwide.
nationwide,
most
indians
have
trust
allotments
that
are
farmland
or
grazing
land.
in
1910
congress
had
heard
that
the
indians
weren't
getting
any
revenue
out
of
their
timber,
and
that
was
an
unfortunate
thing,
and
congress
ought
to
do
something
about
it.
so
congress
passed
the
act
of
1910,
which
is
the
principal
act
upon
which
we
rely.
that
act
says
that
the
timber
on
these
trust
allotments
can
be
sold
by
the
indian
with
the
consent
of
the
secretary.
now,
merely
consenting
to
the
sale
of
the
timber
doesn't
on
its
face
sound
like
the
secretary
is
being
given
much
authority
to
manage
and
sell
this
timber;
but
it
really
does
mean
that
in
practice.
when
you
look
at
what's
involved
in
selling
timber,
which
is
you
require
a
high
degree
of
know
how
and
you
require
resources
to
get
the
timber
out
of
there.
selling
and
logging
timber
is
a
sophisticated
process,
and
it
can't
be
handled
by
an
untrained
person.
to
his
credit,
the
secretary
realized
this,
and
right
from
the
beginning
he
interpreted
the
1910
act
as
giving
him
the
authority
to
manage
these
timber
sales,
and
that's
what
he
did.
he
wrote
very
extensive
regulations
beginning
in
1911,
the
year
after
the
act,
and
he
employed
a
large
staff
to
manage
these
sales.
you
referred
to
this
same
comprehensive
management
system
in
white
mountain
apache
v.
bracker
which
you
decided
three
years
ago.
i
might
add
that
starting
in
1920,
congress
authorized
the
secretary
to
begin
charging
a
fee
for
his
services,
and
the
secretary
did
so.
he
enacted
regulations
that
permit
fees
up
to
10
percent.
in
1941
some
of
the
indians
objected
to
this
comprehensive
control
that
the
secretary
was
exercising
over
their
land,
and
they
went
to
court.
they
sued
for
an
injunction
to
make
the
secretary
stop
exercising
all
this
control
over
their
land
which
they
felt
was
not
good
management.
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
act
was
correct.
in
1946
congress
amended
the
1910
act...
excuse
me,
1964...
congress
amended
the
1910
act,
and
they
made
explicit
at
that
time
some
of
the
factors
that
the
secretary
had
already
read
into
the
1910
act,
such
as
the
need
to
maintain
the
productive
capacity
of
the
land
and
the
best
interests
of
the
indian
allottee.
there
are
other
relevant
statutes
such
as
those
requiring
the
secretary
to
manage
the
timber
on
a
sustained
yield
basis.
that
was
contemplated
actually
in
the
1910
act,
but
it
wasn't
made
an
express
statutory
command
until
1934.
another
one
is
the
suite
of
statutes
authorizing
the
secretary
to
grant
rights
of
way
to
outsiders
across
indian
land
upon
payment
of
compensation.
still
another
is
authorizing
him
to
invest
timber
proceeds
and
other
money
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians.
incidentally,
that's
not
a
statute
calling
for
interest.
it's
a
statute
calling
for
investment,
and
the
investments
are
limited
to
federal
securities.
these
statutes
are
all
part
of
one
statutory
program.
the
basic
act
is
the
general
allotment
act
which
established
the
trust,
which
admittedly
with
respect
to
timber
was
a
bare
trust.
the
statutes
supplementing
the
general
allotment
act
are,
as
i've
said,
the
1910
act,
the
1964
act
amending
it,
the
1934
sustained
yield
act,
the
right
of
way
acts,
and
the
interest
acts...
excuse
me,
the
investment
acts.
now,
so
far
i've
been
talking
about
individual
indians.
the
tribe
owns
timber
also,
and
they
are
a
plaintiff
in
this
case
also.
as
to
them,
the
secretary
treated
their
timber
essentially
the
same
as
he
did
the
tribal
timber
under
another
section
of
the
1910
act.
the
tribal
timber
was
not
held
in
trust
under
the
general
allotment
act,
but
it
was
held
in
trust
under
other
acts.
one
act
was
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934,
and
there
were
several
other
special
acts
whereby
congress
made
direct
grants
of
land
to
the
tribe
in
trust
for
the
tribe.
these
are
cited
in
our
brief.
now,
none
of
the
tribal
trusts
spelled
out
any
particular
duties
either
any
more
than
the
general
allotment
act
did.
so
the
duties
that
we
argue
are
present
were
infused
into
these
trusts
by
the
supplementary,
same
supplementary
acts
that
i've
just
mentioned.
the
first
time
we
were
here
three
years
ago
we
argued
that
the
fact
that
the
united
states
held
the
land
in
trust
for
the
indians
was
enough
just
by
itself
to
ground
them,
to
ground
their
right
for
damages
for
trust
mismanagement.
you
said
no,
the
trusts
taken
by
themselves
don't
spell
out
any
duty
to
manage
timber,
so
first
we
have
to
find
some
statutory
basis
for
a
duty
to
manage
timber.
and
then
you
said
assuming
we
can
do
that,
we
also
have
to
show
that
the...
the
other
statute
that
we're
relying
on
that
bring
out
these
duties
must
be
fairly
interpreted
as
mandating
compensation
for
the
damage
sustained
under
the
testan
rule.
we
went
back
to
the
court
of
claims,
and
the
court
of
claims
agreed
after
argument
and
re
argument,
both
times
en
banc,
they
finally
agreed
6
to
1
that
the
statutes
i
mentioned
supplementing
the
general
allotment
act
did
impose
duties
to
manage
timber
and
could
fairly
be
interpreted
as
mandating
compensation
for
the
damage
sustained.
now,
here's
the
difference
between
the
majority
of
the
court
of
claims
and
the
dissenting
judge.
the
dissenting
judge
felt
with
the
supplementary
statutes
that
i
mentioned,
the
1910
act
and
so
forth
that
supplement
the
general
allotment
act,
could
not
be
fairly
interpreted
as
requiring
compensation
except
to
the
extent
that...
and
i
think
this
is
a
fair
characterization
of
what
he
said...
except
to
the
extent
that
they
would
support
an
action
for
liquidated
damages.
he
didn't
use
the
term
"liquidated",
but
that's
what
he
meant.
he
meant
where
you
can
tell
the
amount
of
damages
without
much
difficulty.
the
majority,
on
the
other
hand,
was
unwilling
to
be
that
narrow.
they
felt
if
the
total
trust
program
showed
a
presently
existing
legal
right
to
revenue,
as
they
did,
at
least
in
the
case
of
those
allotments
that
had
been
logged,
that
would
be
enough
to
permit
a
suit
for
damages
to
cover
the
revenues
properly...
improperly
diminished
or
the
value
of
the
principal
improperly
lost.
the
court
was
narrow
in
other
respects,
however.
it
threw
out
our
claims
for
consequential
damages,
as
it
called
them,
and
certain
claims
which
involved
government
discretion.
it
limited
us
strictly
to
claims
for
value
lost.
i
now
begin
my
argument,
and
the
content
of
my
argument
consists
primarily
of
the
reasons
why
our
case
is
different
from
the
testan
case
and
meets
the
standards
laid
down
in
that
case.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
i'm
not
confused.
you
simply
said
it
two
different
ways,
and
they
both
can
fly.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
wouldn't
even
say
that.
i
would
say
that
the--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--to
me
what
you've
said
is
the
tucker
act...
you've
said
sometimes
the
tucker
act
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
but
you
need
further
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
when
you're
dealing
with
a
damage
claim.
and
you
have
to
show
that
the
statute
under
which
you
claim
contemplates,
impliedly
or
expressly,
a
remedy
of
damages.
that's
our
case,
and
that's
our
problem,
is
trying
to
show
that
our
statutes
do
contemplate
a
remedy
in
damage.
they
don't
expressly,
obviously.
if
they
did,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
and
obviously,
equally
obviously,
they
don't
have
to
say
it
expressly;
otherwise,
you
wouldn't
have
had
the
case.
you
would
have
said
the
last
time
that
there
is
no
express
allowance;
therefore,
there's
nothing
further
to
argue
about.
so
there
must
be
room
to
argue
implication
in
this
case.
and
indeed,
that's
exactly
what
the
language
"fairly
interpreted"
means
in
your
testan
case.
"interpreted"
means
there's
some
room
for
interpretation.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
well,
you're
referring
to
the
court
type
cases?
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
implied
private
right
of
action.
well,
those
are
a
different
animal
than
our
case.
those
are
piggyback
cases.
that's
where
congress
passes
a
public
law,
and
along
comes
a
private
person,
and
he
says
that
this
enables
me
to
sue,
too.
here,
we're
dealing
with
statutes
that
deal
directly
with
these
plaintiffs
here,
and
in
fact--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--yes.
that
was
one
of
four
elements
that
you
laid
down
in
the
court
case.
here,
it's
the
only
named--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--perhaps
it
should
be.
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
number
of
factors
that
i
think
make
this
case
sui
generis
from
those
dealing
with
public
rights
generally.
here,
we
have
private
rights.
these
indians
were
given
private
rights
by
express
intent
of
congress,
and
they're
trying
to
sue
on
those
rights.
we
think
that
the
correct
law
consists--
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
--of
course.
that's...
that's
all
we're
addressing
ourselves
to.
the
government
admits
we
have
the
rights,
and
they
admit
that
we
have
the
remedy
in
equity,
but
they
don't
admit
that
we
have
the
right
to
damages.
that's,
of
course,
what
we're
talking
about
today.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
and
i'm
going
to
give
you
the
reasons
why
we
think
that
it
all
adds
up
to
where
there's
a
compelling
inference
that
congress
must
have
intended
that
these
indians
have
damages.
we
think
the
correct
statement
of
the
law
consistent
with
what
you
said
in
testan
is
this:
well,
if
the
court
finds
that
congress
authorized
the
government
to
take
the
indian
property
in
trust,
which
it
did
here,
and
operate
the
trust
so
as
to
generate
income,
which
it
did
here,
or
protect
the
value
of
the
property,
which
is
also
true
here,
then
that
alone
creates
the
cause
of
action
for
damages,
which
can
be
adjudicated
under
the
tucker
act.
for
jurisdictional
purposes
the
trust
fills
the
same
purpose
as
the
contract
does
in
the
typical
contract
case.
the
tucker
act
is
not
what
says
you
have
a
cause
of
action
under
a
contract.
the
contract
is
where
you
find
that
cause
of
action.
and
so
here,
you
find
the
cause
of
action
in
the
trust.
we
don't
claim
we
find
it
in
the
tucker
act,
and
you've
made
that
clear
that
that's
not
where
it
exists.
for
jurisdictional
purposes
the
trust
fills
the
same
office
as
the
contract
does
in
a
contract
case.
the
question
of
what
duties
were
breached
in
the
course
of
operating
that
trust
or
contract
we
would
have
thought,
our
preference
would
have
been
to
have
that
litigated
after
the
case
begins,
because
so
often
these
duties
are
closely
interwoven
with
the
facts;
and
it
is
a
problem
of
judicial
administration
to
try
to
pull
that
problem
out
and
deal
with
it
first,
and
then
if
you
win
that,
go
on
to
your
merits.
to
us,
the
proper
law
should
be
that
if
you
prove
the
existence
of
the
trust
and
that
it
has
some
duties,
then
you're
past
the
jurisdictional
hurdle;
then
you
must
show
that
those
duties
required
action
that
the
government
didn't
take
or
prohibited
action
that
the
government
did
take,
and
if
so,
how
much
the
loss
of
value
was.
now,
the
court
of
claims
held
that
that
was
the
correct
law,
starting
with
the
klamath
case
in
1966.
so
when
we
filed
our
case
in
1971,
that
had
been
the
law
expressly
for
five
years,
and
the
court
of
claims
after
that
klamath
case
in
1966,
a
dozen
cases
had
ruled
to
that
effect
up
until
your
testan
case
when
the
question
arose
that
we're
now
discussing.
that's
also
true
in
a
number
of
other
federal
courts.
the
moose
case,
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenter
thought
that
the
existence
of
the
trust
was
all
you
needed
to
get
through
the
tucker
act.
that
case
was
decided
after
testan
and
mitchell,
and
therefore
considered
itself
in
harmony
with
both
of
your
opinions.
the
whiskers
case
in
the
tenth
circuit,
also
cited
in
our
brief,
that
was
decided
after
testan
but
before
mitchell.
they
said
that
if
you
prove
the
trust,
you
have
proved
all
you
need
to
to
get
into
court.
and
there
are
two
additional
district
courts,
different
district
courts,
different
judges,
in
california
who
have
also
ruled
to
the
same
effect.
and
that
was
the
view
of
the
three
dissenting
justices,
i
believe,
as
i
read
them,
when
this
case
was
here
before.
but
the
majority
of
you
seemed
to
feel
that
the
question
of
what
duties
the
trust
imposed
was
part
of
the
testan
analysis
and
therefore
a
threshold
issue
that
had
to
be
adjudicated
before
the
merits
were
reached
to
see
if
they
mandated
compensation.
i
have
to
express
the
hope
that
once
the
law
is
sorted
out,
if
it
is
sorted
out
in
our
favor,
that
it
would
be
possible
to
handle
that
question
during
the
trial
of
the
merits
rather
than
as
a
preliminary
question.
now,
i
come
now
to
the
part
of
my
argument.
the
government
says
the
ultimate
question
here
is
one
of
congressional
intent.
we
agree.
if
congress
had
said
what
it
wanted,
we
wouldn't
be
here;
so
we
have
to
look
to
secondary
sources
to
see
what
congress
intended,
and
the
intent
we're
looking
for
is
an
intent
that
these
plaintiffs
have
money
damages
for
the
vindication
of
their
right,
which
everyone
concedes
that
they
have.
they
have
the
right
but...
they
have
the
right,
but
the
question
is
whether
it's
vindicatable
in
damages.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
yes.
and,
of
course,
underlying
every
point
i
make
is
well,
how
is
our
case
different
from
testan.
well,
first
of
all
i'm
going
to
go
through
eight
points.
the
first
point
is
that
there
is
the
trust
relationship
here
which
was
not
present
in
the
testan
case.
congress
created
a
trust
in
1877.
then
it
infused
additional
duties
into
that
trust
in
1910
and
after.
as
this
court
held
in
the
bracker
case,
the
purpose
of
that
trust,
or
at
least
the
management
of
the
timber
in
trust,
was
to
generate
for
the
indians
whatever
profit
the
forest
was
capable
of
yielding.
that's
a
quotation
from
your
white
mountain
apache,
448
u.s.
149.
these
regulations
dealing
with
this
trust
timber
were
approved
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
eastman
case
in
1941.
when
congress
creates
a
trust,
we
submit
that
congress
intends
whatever
remedy
is
necessary
to
carry
out
that
trust,
if
the
trust
is
breached.
since
the
purpose
of
this
trust
was
to
generate
money,
it
follows
that
congress'
intent
following
the
purpose
of
the
trust
was
to
make
up
for
that
money
if
the
government
by
improper
action
caused
a
loss
of
that
money.
in
testan
you
didn't
have
a
trust.
in
fact,
you
didn't
even
have
a
contracted
employment.
the
second
point
is
this:
if
you
feel
that
more
than
the
bare
trust
is
required,
well,
it
so
happens
that
we
have
an
actual
glimpse
of
the
intent
of
congress,
the
actual
intent
of
congress
here.
in
1946
congress
passed
the
indian
claims
commission
act,
and
part
of
that
was
what
we
call
the
indian
tucker
act.
the
indian
tucker
act
was
in
effect
a
repetition
of
the
tucker
act
and
made
applicable
to
indians.
and
the
legislative
history
clearly
shows
that
they
expected
indian
breach
of
trust
suits
to
be
brought
under
that
act
for
damages.
i'd
like
to
read
you
a
couple
of
quotes
in
our
brief.
if
you
want
to
follow
them
with
me,
it's
on
page
28
of
our
red
brief.
i
think
the
language
is
so
strong
i'd
like
to
have
it
before
all
of
us.
the
sponsor
of
this
act
and
the
provision
we're
talking
about
was
henry
jackson
of
washington,
now
senator
jackson.
he
said
in
the
course
of
the
debate
that,
"the
interior
department
itself
suggested
that
it
ought
not
be
in
a
position
where
its
employees
can
mishandle
funds
and
lands
of
a
national
trusteeship
without
complete
accountability.
"
"let
us
see
that
the
indians
have
their
fair
day
in
court
so
that
they
can
call
the
various
government
agencies
to
account
on
the
obligations
that
the
federal
government
assumed.
"
and
the
house
report,
following
the
same
trend,
said,
"if
we
fail
to
meet
these
obligations
by
denying
access
to
the
courts
when
trust
funds
have
been
improperly
dissipated
or
other
fiduciary
duties
have
been
violated,
we
compromise
the
national
honor
of
the
united
states.
"
i
don't
see
how
you
can
read
that
language
and
conclude
that
congress
didn't
intend
for
breach
of
trust
actions
involving
damages
to
be
brought
under
the
indian
tucker
act.
mr.
charles
a.
hobbs
i
can't
speak
to
that.
that's
a
complex
question.
but
it
is
a
fact
that
the
indian
tucker
act
has
a
legislative
history
showing
that
it
was
intended
that
suits
brought
under
it
for
breach
of
trust
could...
could
be
brought.
my
third
point
is
the
negative
inference.
in
the
testan
case
the
claimant
was
seeking
back
pay.
now,
congress
had
carefully
spelled
out
what
remedy
you
get
when
you're
misclassified,
and
one
of
the
remedies
it
did
not
mention
was
back
pay.
there
was
another
possible
act,
the
back
pay
act,
but
that
clearly
did
not
apply
because
it
only
applied
to
people
who
were
removed
from
a
position
they
held.
it
did
not
apply
to
people
like
testan
who
didn't
hold
the
position.
well,
if
congress
says
if
the
government
breaches
its
duty
you
get
to
do
a,
that's
an
implication
that
they
thought
about
and
didn't
intend
for
you
to
get
b.
so
there's
a
negative
inference
present
in
testan
that's
not
present
here.
i
think
that
the
next
point,
my
point
number
four,
supports
that,
buttresses
it.
testan
was
claiming
a
right
not
known
in
common
law.
he
was
claiming
a
right
created
by
congress,
which
was
the
right
to
equal
pay
for
equal
work.
now,
it's
reasonable
to
say
for
a
right
that
was
created
in
the
beginning
by
congress
with
no
comparable
rights
in
common
law,
it's
reasonable
to
say
what
remedy
did
congress
want
when
it
created
this
new
right.
and
i
think
it
was
fair
to
ask
in
the
testan
case
that
if
congress
is
going
to
create
a
right,
it'd
better
then
spell
out
what
remedy
it
wants
to
go
with
this
new
right;
otherwise,
we're
at
sea.
we
don't
know
what
kind
of
remedy
congress
wanted.
but
what
about
our
case?
our
case
involves
a
trust
relationship,
which
is
very
well
known
in
common
law.
we
think
that
the
proper
presumption
is
that
when
congress
recognizes
a
right,
creates
a
right,
if
you
like,
but
a
right
well
known
in
common
law
such
as
this
trust
right,
that
it
intends
the
ordinary
and
usual
remedy
for
breach
of
trust,
unless
it
gives
some
indication
to
the
contrary,
which
it
did
not
do
in
our
case.
of
course,
common
law
for
a
breach
of
trust,
damages
is
the
absolutely
regular
remedy.
five,
the
canons
of
construction.
you've
ruled
many
times
that
the
canons
of
construction
call
for
construing
statutes
in
favor
of
indians
when
those
statutes
are
intended
for
the
benefit
of
indians,
as
these
are.
and
that
includes
cases
where
the
indian
interests
are
in
competition
with
those
of
the
united
states,
as
here.
our
footnote
23
lists
some
of
the
cases
so
holding.
our
point
six
is
present
right
versus
future
right.
testan
only
had
a
future
right.
he
had
to
first
get
classified
to
where
he
said
he
should
be
before
he
had
a
right
to
money.
we
have
a
present
right.
once
the
secretary
started
to
log
our
timber,
we
had
a
right
that
it
be
done
properly.
therefore,
we're
like
wickersham,
a
case
you
cited
in
the
testan
case,
where
he
held
his
position
and
was
removed
from
it,
and
therefore
had
a
present
right
to
be
paid.
point
seven
is
consideration.
we're
paying
a
good
price
to
have
the
secretary
perform
these
services,
whereas
this
is
not
a
gratuitous
action...
service
provided
by
the
secretary.
in
addition
to
actual
money
consideration,
there's
another
consideration
point
that
has
been
recognized
by
president...
all
presidents
since
president
nixon
and
by
many
cases,
and
that
is
this:
these
lands
are
part
of
the
great
transaction
with
indian
tribes.
when
the
united
states
took
over
lands
from
the
indians,
it
made
a
bargain,
which
has
been
recognized
by
the
courts
even
though
the
treaty
may
not
have
said
it
in
so
many
words.
and
the
bargain
was:
you
come
under
our
protection.
we'll
take
the
land
you
don't
need,
and
we'll
educate
you
and
bring
you
to
the
point
of
competency;
and
in
the
meantime
we'll
hold
your
land
in
trust.
the
eighth
one,
the
final
point
i
want
to
make,
is
the
intent
of
congress
that
you
found
in
the
capoeman
case...
and
capoeman
is
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case...
that
was
a
tax
refund
case,
and
you
held
that
there
was
an
implied
exemption
to
the
federal
income
tax
because
when
congress
set
these
lands
aside,
it
did
not
intend
that
their
value
be
depleted
by
taxes.
well,
it
seems
that
we
have
the
same
situation
here.
if
congress
intended
that
the
trust
property
be
undepleted
by
federal
taxes,
doesn't
it
follow
that
it
shouldn't
be
depleted
by
federal
mismanagement?
why
should
our
case
be
any
different...
this
is
a
new
line
of
argument...
why
should
our
case
be
any
different
because
our
property
is
timber
rather
than
money?
if
we
had
money,
we
could
sue
for
breach
of
trust,
for
failure
to
manage
the
money
properly.
that's
the
moose
case,
the
whiskers
case,
the
dissent
below
admits
that.
how
can
you
justifiably
draw
a
distinction
between
timber
and
funds,
especially
when
the
purpose
of
managing
the
timber
is
to
generate
money?
and
finally,
as
we've
made
out
in
our
brief,
we
have
a
contract
here.
the
power
of
attorney,
which
is
reproduced
at
appendix
1
of
our
red
brief,
appoints
the
united
states
to
be
the
agent
of
the
allottee
and
to
sell
his
timber
and
to
"do
all,
perform
every
act
necessary
and
requisite
to
the
consummation
of
the
sale.
"
that
means
the
whole
panoply
of
actions
that
the
secretary
did.
and
that
power
of
attorney
also
authorizes
the
secretary
to
charge
a
fee
for
that
service.
now,
we
think
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
minds
here;
that
the
allottee
expected
not
only
that
his
timber
would
be
managed,
but
that
it
would
be
managed
competently.
we
can
look
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
1910
act
for
that
conclusion.
the
government
spells
it
out
pretty
well
in
footnote
25,
showing
that
the
question
of
whether
the
secretary
was
going
to
be
a
competent
manager
was
an
important
point
during
the
legislative
history.
these
indians
had
a
right
under
the
1910
act
to
competent
management,
and
that
takes
expression
in
the
power
of
attorney
that's
reproduced
in
our
brief.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
argument.
