don't
we
have
to
declare
the
compact
unenforceable,
non-enforceable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
how
we
can
act
under
the
compact.
if
you
get
rid
of
the
compact,
then
i
could
understand,
but
to
say
that
we
are
a
tie-breaker
under
the
compact
to
me
is
not
quite
correct,
because
it's
not
mentioned
in
the
compact.
where
would
you
find
the
authority
to...
where
would
you
find
the
authority
to,
if
we
didn't
appoint
a
tie-breaker,
to
go
ahead
and
exercise
the
authority
of
the
commission?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
one
state
accuses
the
other
state
of
violating
the
compact,
the
only
way
you
can
get
redress
is
for
the
other
state
to
admit
they
did
wrong.
is
that
what
the
compact
says?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
anything
more
to
it
than
verbiage
about
a
tie-breaker?
suppose
it
said
that
i
just
will
decide
this
as
the
master
and
he
had
not
said
a
tie-breaker.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
problem
that
two
of
you
couldn't
agree
and
they
had
to
put
a
tie-breaker
in?
is
that
the
problem
that's
here
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assuming
that
it
is,
does
it
make
any
sense
to
send
it
back
to
those
same
two
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
same
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
makes
you
think
they'll
agree
now?
