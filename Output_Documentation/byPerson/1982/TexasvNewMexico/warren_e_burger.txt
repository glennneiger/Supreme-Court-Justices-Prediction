chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
the
original
jurisdiction
case,
the
state
of
texas
against
the
state
of
new
mexico.
mr.
townsend,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
strip
the
form
away
from
this
idea
of
a
tie-breaker,
wouldn't
the
tie-breaker
in
effect
be
a
super-special
master
who
would
merely
advise
this
court
in
which
way
to
break
the
tie?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
townsend.
miss
uram.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
how
is
this
problem
going
to
be
resolved?
you
say
they
can't
agree.
the
master
has
no
authority,
and
we
have
no
authority
to
appoint
a
tie-breaker.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
they
continue
in
their
present
state
of
mind?
how
is
this
matter
going
to
be
resolved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
townsend?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
