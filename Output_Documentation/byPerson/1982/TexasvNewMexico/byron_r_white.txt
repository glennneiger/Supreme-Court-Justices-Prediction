so
the...
either
you
appoint
a
tie-breaker
or
you
make
the
determination
yourself
that
the
commission
should
make.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
second
suggestion,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
proceed
to
determine
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
to
do
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
compact
calls
for
that
decision
to
be
made
by
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
we
have
the
authority
to
take
the
place
of
the
commission
in
that
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
we
have
the
authority
to
appoint
a
tie-breaker,
you
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
--those
hearings
were
pursuant
to
a
pre-trial
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
commission
adopt
the
river
routing
method
ever?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wasn't
stated
in
the
compact.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
has
the
commission
proceeded
on,
purported
to
proceed
on
that
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
it
consistent
with
the
compact
to
adopt
another
method
for
determining
the
1947
condition?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
you
say
the
legislative
history
of
the
compact
indicates
that
the
river
routing
was
anticipated
to
be
the
method
to
be
employed.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
from
your
brief
and
what
you
say
that
you
say
we
have
no
more
authority
to
do
what
texas
suggests
or
the
master
has,
that
he
has
no
more
authority
to
go
forward
than
we
have
to
appoint
a
tie-breaker.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
the
compact
itself
say
that
the
determinations
of
the
commission
are
reviewable
in
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
the
commission
already
decided
all
those
four?
has
the
commission
already
addressed
those
four
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
certainly
do
suggest
that
judge
breitenstein
really
had
no
conception
of
what
the
case
was
all
about,
that
he
should
just
have
referred
it
back
to
the
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
any
determination
of
the
commission
would
be
subject
to
de
novo
determination
in
a
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
wouldn't
review
it
on
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me.
your
opposition
says
that
the
commission
adopted
the
brd
or
whatever
it
is,
and
directed
that
a
manual
be
prepared,
and
then
what
happened?
when
did
all
this
so-called
disagreement
start?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
anticipated
that
that
method
be
used
in
the
future,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
disagreement
ever
since.
justice
byron
r.
white
since
'61?
