justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
it
would
be
contrary
to
vermont
against
new
york
and
to
other
cases
from
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
a
super-special
master
particularly
with--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--certainly
then
it
would
be
outside
of
our
decisions
entirely.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
this
be
much
different...
why
is
what
texas
is
asking
much
different
than
saying
there
is
a
dispute
between
new
mexico
and
texas
over
the
apportionment
of
water
and
just
like
if
you're
litigating
that
without
a
compact
you
would
look
at
the
boundary
that
congress
has
established
between
texas
and
new
mexico
to
decide,
you
know,
where
the
pecos
flows
from
new
mexico
into
texas?
here,
in
addition,
you've
got
another
statute
of
congress,
a
compact,
which
says
something
about
the
water
rights
in
the
states.
why
couldn't
the
master
simply
treat
that
the
same
way
he
does
the
boundary
statute
and
say
we've
got
two
federal
statutes
here
and
we've
got
to
work
with
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
miss
uram,
what
is
the
authority
for
your
position
that
the
master
and,
ultimately,
this
court
can
sit
as
a
reviewing
court
to
review
the
findings
of
the
compact
agency?
ordinarily,
those
sort
of
things
are
set
out
in
the
statute,
that
the
agency
does
certain
things
and
then
a
court
does
certain
other
things,
and
here
you're
just
kind
of
superimposing
this
court
on
the
agency
without
any
statutory
structure.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
say
in
what
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
would
be
the
first
agency,
i
think,
that
had
its
findings
directly
reviewable
in
the
supreme
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
these
more
recent
compacts
that
you
refer
to
which
specify
agency
authority
and
court
review
specify
the
court
in
which
the
review
shall
take
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
neither
specify
this
court,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
if
nothing
ever
happens
under
the
compact,
probably
no
one
wants
to
get
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
there
isn't
any
enforcement
mechanism
and,
as
you
say,
the
procedures
are
voluntary,
then
a
party
who
feels
that
the
compact
isn't
giving
that
state
the
fair
share
that
the
agreement
provided
for
may
feel
very
strongly
something
should
be
done
but
the
party
which
feels
that
it's
really
getting
the
lion's
share,
which
i
suspect
may
more
often
than
not
be
the
upstream
state,
may
be
perfectly
content
with
a
rather
ineffectual
compact
organization.
