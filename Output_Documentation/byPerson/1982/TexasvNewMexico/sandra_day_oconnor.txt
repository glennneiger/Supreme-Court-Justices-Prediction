--mr.
townsend,
do
you
think
the
master
rejected
texas'
motion
to
use
the
double
mass
analysis
on
the
merits,
or
did
he
just
decide
that
it
shouldn't
be
decided
until
other
issues
are
resolved?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
language
is
unclear,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
townsend,
the
compact
itself,
in
article
vi
seems
to
indicate
that
unless
and
until
a
more
feasible
method
is
devised
and
adopted
by
the
commission
that
the
inflow-outflow
method
will
be
used.
would
it
be
your
position
that
if
the
court
were
to
direct
the
master
to
proceed,
that
notwithstanding
that
clear
provision
of
the
compact,
that
some
other
method
should
be
considered?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
except
it
says
the
method
as
described
in
the
report
of
the
engineering
advisory
committee
will
be
used.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
miss
uram,
the
master
found
that
the
review
of
basic
data
was
developed
only
for
the
period
of
1950
to
1961
and
so
it
does
not
answer
the
questions
for
the
future.
i
mean,
that
was
the
master's
determination.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
united
states
in
its
brief
also,
if
i
remember
correctly,
indicated
that
we
certainly
can't
decide
everything
based
on
the
review
of
basic
data,
that
maybe
it's
a
guideline
to
be
employed
but
that
it
won't
solve
all
the
problems.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
basically
are
you
requesting
that
the
master
quantify
the
water
as
of
1947
and
then
provide
for
annual
distribution
techniques?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
would
require
the
commission
to
go
back
and
quantify
the
datas
based
on
the
principles
established
in
the
review
of
basic
data.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
at
this
point
they've
been
unable
to
agree
for
some
years.
