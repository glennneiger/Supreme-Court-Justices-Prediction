yes.
all
right.
well,
where
is...
what's
the
source
of
our
authority
to
appoint
a
tie-breaker?
it's
not
the
compact
itself
by
construction,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can't
construe
the
compact
as
authorizing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
what
do
you
think
is
the
source
of
our
authority
to
appoint
a
tie-breaker?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
cited
nothing
to
support
that.
do
you
have
anything
to
suggest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don't
think
that's
different
in
the
case
of...
don't
you
think
that's
different
where
the
states
themselves
have
entered
into
a
compact?
if
this
had
just
been
a
dispute
between
the
states,
i
could
see
the
merit
in
your
argument,
but
is
that
true
when
there's
a
compact
that
the
states
have
entered
into?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
standard
of
review?
what
standard
of
review
by
the
court?
