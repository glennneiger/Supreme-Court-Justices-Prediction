mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
suit
to
enforce
the
pecos
river
compact.
texas
and
new
mexico
intended
the
compact
to
equitably
apportion
the
waters
of
the
pecos
river
between
the
states.
the
compact
contemplates
continuing
administration
of
the
pecos
river
in
conformity
with
the
terms
of
the
compact.
the
compact
imposes
upon
new
mexico,
the
upstream
state,
the
obligation
not
to
deplete
by
man's
activities
the
state
line
flow
below
that
available
to
texas
under
the
1947
condition.
the
controversy
between
the
states
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
1947
condition
precipitated
this
lawsuit.
the
special
master
rejected
the
conflicting
contentions
of
the
states
concerning
the
1947
condition
and
defined
the
1947
condition
in
his
1979
report.
his
1979
report
was
confirmed
in
all
respects
and
his
definition
of
the
1947
condition
was
approved.
since
that
time,
we
have
been
attempting
to
translate
the
definition
of
the
1947
condition
into
water
quantities
to
provide
a
numerical
standard
by
which
compliance
can
be
measured.
the
states
disagree
as
to
the
procedure
to
implement
the
definition
of
the
1947
condition.
as
a
result,
numerous
hearings
have
been
held
and
the
master
has
issued
his
report
and
recommendations.
the
master
has
recommended
that
the
new
mexico
motion
to
dismiss
the
suit
be
denied,
that
the
texas
motion
to
substitute
the
double
mass
analysis
for
the
river
routing
as
the
accounting
procedure
be
denied--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
--without
prejudice
for
further
consideration
at
the
commission.
also,
he
recommended
that
the
united
states
representative
on
the
pecos
commission
or
some
third
party
be
vested
with
the
power
to
participate
in
commission
deliberations
and
to
vote
when
the
states
are
not
able
to
agree.
he
then
recommended
that
the
matter
should
be
returned
to
the
commission
for
the
performance
by
it
of
its
duties
and
that
the
court
retain
jurisdiction.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
i
do
not
believe
that
he
rejected
the
double
mass
on
its
merits.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
it's...
the
master
found
the
double
mass
to
be
an
accounting
procedure
useful
in
the
inflow-outflow
method.
however,
he
was
concerned
about
some
language
that
the
engineer
advisors
to
the
compact
negotiators
used
in
their
report,
and
based
on
their
statement
the
allocation
shouldn't
be
based
on
a
straight
line
he
felt
it
was
not
proper
for
him
to
use
the
double
mass.
texas
contends
that
texas
has
addressed
the
concerns
of
the
engineer
advisors
and
that
double
mass
is
based
upon
a
curvolinear
basis
as
opposed
to
straight-line
percentage.
texas
believes
that
the
master
has
not
rejected
the
double
mass
on
its
merits.
he...
there
are
not
sufficient
findings
in
his
report
to
reach
that
conclusion.
the
primary
position
of
texas
is
that
this
suit
not
be
dismissed
and
that
the
court
retain
jurisdiction
so
that
the
disputes
between
the
states
may
be
resolved
by
whatever
means
the
court
deems
appropriate.
if
the
suit
is
dismissed,
texas'
only
alternative
is
to
take...
to
try
to
take
steps
to
institute
an
equitable
apportionment
of
the
waters
of
the
pecos
river
between
the
states.
however,
article
xiv
of
the
compact
provides
that
it
takes
the
action
of
the
legislatures
of
both
states
to
terminate
the
compact.
so
this
compact
provision
may
prevent
texas
from
seeking
the
remedy
of
equitable
apportionment.
however,
texas
believes
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
continue
the
suit
to
a
complete
resolve
of
the
disputes
concerning
the
compact.
texas
accepted
the
master's
recommendation
that
a
tie-breaker
vote
be
placed
upon
the
commission.
this
was
not
a
texas
idea.
texas
has
never
argued
this,
but
texas
accepted
that
as
a
practical
solution
to
an
ongoing
problem.
because
this
is
not
a
texas
idea,
we
prefer
to
rely
upon
the
argument
of
the
master
contained
in
his
report
for
support
of
that
recommendation.
texas
would
like
to
move
to
its
alternative
exceptions
in
the
event
the
court
does
not
accept
the
master's
recommendation
that
a
tie-breaker
vote
be
placed
upon
the
commission.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
yes,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
you
do
have
the
power
to
do
that
because
it
would
carry
out
the
express
intent
and
purpose
of
the
compact,
and
those
primary
purposes
were
to
provide
an
equitable
apportionment
of
the
use
of
the
waters,
and
to
remove
the
causes
of
present
and
future
controversies.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
as
the
master
has
found,
the
good
faith
differences
as
far
as
engineering
judgments
as
to
the
procedure
to
implement
or
to
determine
whether
or
not
compliance
with
the
compact
is
continuing.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
it's
deficient.
this
particular
compact,
like
many
other
compacts,
provides
for
a
unanimous
vote,
and
there
are
no
mechanisms
to
resolve
impasses
when
the
commissioners
cannot
agree.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
court--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
--our
second
suggestion
is
that
the
court
retain
jurisdiction
and
as--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
--whether
or
not
new
mexico
has
fulfilled
its
obligations.
that
necessarily
requires--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
--the
commission
is
granted
the
power
to
make
certain
factfindings
concerning
the
obligations.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
yes,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
--well,
i
think
it's
within
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
fashion
remedies
to
resolve
the
dispute.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
it's
not...
you're
right--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
--not
any
specific
terms
other
than--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
--according
to
the
master,
it's
your
equitable
powers
to
do
the
essence
of
equity,
is
to
do
equity
and
fashion
a
mode.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
the
only
other
thing
that
i
have
to
suggest
that
is
the
case
of
virginia
versus
west
virginia,
which
has
been
cited
by
the
parties
for
the
proposition
that
the
court
can
enforce
its
judgments
even
though
that
may
require
or
involve
state
governmental
instrumentalities.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
well,
in
virginia
versus
west
virginia
there
was
a
compact,
and
the
court,
in
reaching
its
conclusion,
held
that
the
congressional
power
to
consent
to
agreements
between
the
states
necessarily
implied
the
congressional
power
to
legislate
an
enforcement
of
that
compact.
but
the
court
determined
that
the
fact
that
congress
can
legislate
a
solution
does
not
prevent
the
court
from
exercising
its
jurisdiction
under
article
iii
to
resolve
a
controversy
between
the
states.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
i
would
envision
the
tie-breaker
to
be
an
ongoing
participant
in
the
commission.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
if
he's
viewed
as
an
arbiter,
yes.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
exactly.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
i
agree.
i
believe
the
master's
idea
is
a
novel
one
and
we
are
not
necessarily--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
--to
do--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
--well,
i
believe
that
it's
a
controversy
between
the
states,
be
it,
even
though
the
compact
is
involved,
is
within
the
court's
jurisdiction
under
article
iii,
controversies
between
the
states.
texas
has
alleged
that
new
mexico
has
violated
the
compact.
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
new
mexico
has
violated
the
compact,
there
must
be
an
implementation
of
the
master's
definition
of
the
'47
condition
to
create
the
numerical
standard
by
which
compliance
can
be
measured.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
i
believe
that
he
can,
and
that
has
been
our...
that's
the
argument
of
our
alternative
exceptions,
that
the
determination
of
the
measure
is
necessary
in
the
inquiry
of
has
there
been
a
violation
of
the
compact,
and
in
texas'
opinion
that
is
a
judicial
inquiry,
a
judicial
function
and
was
stated
in
prentiss
versus
atlantic
coast
lines,
211
u.s.
210,
a
1908
case.
we
have
not
cited
that,
but
in
that
case
it
states
that
a
judicial
inquiry
investigates,
declares,
and
enforces
liabilities
based
upon
past
or
present
facts
and
under
existing
law.
and
i
believe
that
texas
contends
that
that
is
the
situation
with
this
law
suit,
that
the
compact
could
have
been
written
without
a
commission
to
make
a
factfinding,
and
it
would
have
been...
the
duty
would
have
been
upon
the
states
to
do
their
own
accounting
to
see
that
there
was
compliance,
and
if
the
states
felt
like
there
was
non-compliance
then
its
remedy
is
exactly
what
it
is
today
under
the
compact.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
also
encompass
us
proving
that
the
other
state
did
wrong.
the
compact
provides
that
the
findings
of
the
commission
are
not
conclusive
in
any
court.
it
specifically
provides
that,
so
the
compact
negotiators
were
anticipating
court
action
to
enforce
the
compact.
there
are
no
enforcement
powers
in
the
pecos
river
commission
as
enforcement
powers
are
in
the
usual
range
of
federal
administrative
agencies
and
others.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
we
have
been
requesting
the
master
to
do
exactly
that,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
and
we
have
argued
that
the
court
should
make
that
decision,
that
it
can
make
that
decision,
but
we
accepted
his
recommendation
because
it
seemed
to
be
a
practical
solution.
the...
texas
is,
as
i
said--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
that's
right,
your
honor.
texas
believes
that
the
master
can
make
any
of
the
decisions
necessary
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
compact
has
been
violated.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
it
appears
to
be,
your
honor.
that's
the
case.
the
united
states
has--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
--contends
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
continue
the
law
suit
and
to
make
all
necessary
determinations
in
that
suit.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
last
march
we
had
approximately
two
weeks
of
hearings
and
i
became
involved
in
the
suit
in
1981
and
we
have
probably
had
a
total
of
15
days
of
hearing.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
the
last
two
weeks...
the
two-week
period
in
last
march
was
receiving
evidence,
and
the
evidence
was
that...
presented...
texas
presented
the
double
mass
analysis
as
the
accounting
procedure
and
then
it
submitted
evidence
as
an
alterative
a
river
routing
procedure
that
it
felt,
believed
to
be
an
accurate
procedure
that
would
accurately
depict
that
definition.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
we
had
an
alternative
theory,
and
that's
the
double
mass.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
it's
in
the
record.
no
resolution.
we
were
anticipating
a
resolution
of
those
issues
in
the
report,
but
the
master
has
taken
a
different
tack.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
those
hearings
were
pursuant
not
to
the
original
pre-trial
order.
those
hearings
were
pursuant
to
an
order
that
was
issued,
i
believe,
in
december
of
'81
and
the
hearings
were
in
march
of
'82.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
your
honor,
the
double
mass
analysis
is
an
inflow-outflow
method.
it
is
an
accounting
procedure
that
can
be
used
in--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
--all
right.
in
respect
to
that,
what
is
described
in
the
engineering
advisory
report
is
a
statement
that
the
inflow-outflow
method
involves
the
determination
of
the
correlation
between
the
index
of
the
inflow
and
the
outflow
from
the
basin.
that,
in
the
view
of
the
master
and
in
view
of
the
texas,
is
the
inflow-outflow
method
described
and
defined
in
the
report
of
the
engineer
advisors.
what
also
is
contained
in
the
report
of
the
engineer
advisors
is
a
river
routing
study
that
is
what
we
have
been
referring
to
throughout
as
the
s.d.
109
river
routing,
which
produced
the
plate
2
standard
of
measurement.
in
the
1979
report,
the
master
found
that
river
routing
to
be
incorrect,
inconsistent
and
contained
omissions.
therefore,
he
held
that
river
routing
to
be
a
nullity
and
that
is
why
he
defined
the
1947
condition
in
the
terms
that
this
court
approved.
so
when
you
revert...
the
compact
specifically
says
that
the
1947
condition
is
that
situation
described
and
defined
in
the
report
of
the
engineer
advisors,
just
like
the
language
in
article
vi.
so
by
the
master's
early
ruling,
he
has
made
that
phrase,
as
described
and
defined
in
reference
to
the
river
routing,
a
nullity.
there
is
a
void
at
that
point
and
texas
contends
that
the
controlling
language
is
149
of
s.d.
109,
and
that
is
where
the
statement
is
that
the
inflow-outflow
method
involves
the
determination
that
the
correlation
between
the
upstream...
or
the
index
of
the
inflow
and
outflow
from
the
basin.
texas
contends
that
if
the
court
were
to
remand
it
back
to
the
master
to
proceed,
then
he
is
left
with
the
choice
as
to
any
inflow-outflow
method
to
depict
the
1947
condition
and
is
not
restricted
to
a
river
routing.
texas
proposed
the
inflow-outflow
method
because
the
master
repeatedly
expressed
his
concerns
about
the
river
routing.
the
river
routing
has
too
many,
he
continually
said,
the
river
routing
has
too
many
unmeasured
values,
too
many
judgment-dependent
techniques.
that
has
caused
the
problem
between
the
states
and
he
was...
expressed
his
desire
that
some
other
method
could
be
used.
texas
proposed
the
double
mass.
the
double
mass
eliminates
the
judgment-dependent
techniques
and
eliminates
the
unmeasured
values.
and
with
that
understanding
texas
proposed
this
as
a
solution
and
a
superior
method
to
the
laborious
river
routing.
the
pecos...
in
regard
to
the
claim
that
continuation
of
the
suit
would
require
this
court
to
perform
administrative
functions,
texas
replies
that
this
is
not...
this
is
a
suit
to
enforce
the
compact.
this
is
a
suit
to
enforce
federal
rights
that
are
created
by
the
compact,
since
it
is
the
law
of
the
union,
and
that
it
is
completely
a
judicial
function
to
determine
those
rights,
even
though
it
may
require
making
those
difficult
decisions
concerning
the
engineering
procedures.
texas
submits
that
this
process
is
easier
than
the
difficult
processes
involved
in
an
equitable
apportionment
suit,
because
the
compact
limits
your
inquiry
to
a
certain
extent.
admittedly,
it's
not
simple,
but
it
is
not
as
difficult
as
an
equitable
apportionment.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
the
compact,
yes,
your
honor,
they
did.
the
compact
negotiators
used
the
river
routing,
and
that
was
going
to
be
the
basis.
and
the
rbd...
excuse
me.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
the
compact
stated
that
the
1947
condition
is
that
situation
described
and
defined
in
the
report
of
the
engineer
advisors,
and
when
you
look
at
the
report
of
the
engineer
advisors
there
is
a
river
routing.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
the
commission
has
not
proceeded
very
far,
your
honor,
but
they
were
attempting
to
utilize
the
river
routing
in
s.d.
109
from
the
beginning
of
the
compact
administration.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
because
the
compact
requires
the
use
of
an
inflow-outflow
method
and
there
are
more
inflow-outflow
methods
than
the
river
routing.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
that
was
the
method
at
that
time,
in
1949.
the
double
mass
is
an
outgrowth...
i
think
is
a
method
that
has
been
used
by
engineers,
but
the
present-day
superiority
of
it
is
due
to
the
fact
of
the
advancement
and
statistical
analysis
and
to
computers
and
to
the
present
day
we
believe
that
the
commission
should
not
necessarily
be
saddled
with
an
antiquated
approach
when
there
is
something
else
available.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
i
agree
with
the
master,
your
honor,
that
he
has
found
the
rbd
to
have
been
adopted
by
the
commission
solely
for
the
purposes
of
finding
facts
between
1950
and
1961
and
then,
i
think,
'62,
and
not
used...
adopted
by
the
commission
for
future
purposes,
accounting
purposes.
so
texas
submits
that
rbd
has
been
utilized
for
a
limited
period
but
not
accepted
as
the
standard
for
the
future
and
that
the
master
is
correct
in
his
finding.
i
have
retained
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
upstream
state
benefits
from
delay
in
decision
and
confusion
in
the
commission.
such
injures
texas.
this
is
not
a
suit
to
review
administrative
actions,
and
i
believe
counsel
for
new
mexico
misspoke
herself
about
the
compact
providing
for
a
review.
it
clearly
states
that
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
commission
shall
not
be
conclusive
in
any
court
but
shall
constitute
prima
facie
evidence.
that
is
not
the
language
used
in
the
conventional
standard
of
review,
the
conventional
standard
of
review
being
that
the
administrative
decisions
are
conclusive
if
they
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
not
the
result
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
actions.
that
is
the
standard
that
new
mexico
is
trying
to
impose
upon
this
particular
compact,
and
this
compact
commission
is
quite
different.
first,
it's
not
a
federal
agency.
second,
it
does
not
use
the
language
of...
the
conventional
language
of
substantial
evidence
review.
it
has
no
enforcement
powers,
and
the
court
in
dyer
versus
sims
recognizes
that
this
court
finally
determines
the
nature
and
scope
and
enforcement
of
these
compacts.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
according
to
its
express
terms,
it
would
be
prima
facie
evidence
and
the
party
would
have
an
opportunity
to
rebut
and
to
contradict
findings
of
the
commission.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
you
would
not
review
it
on
the
record.
there's
no
due
process
procedural
mechanism
to
protect
and
to
present
a
record
as
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
believe,
pointed
out.
there's
not
an
objective,
non-biased
body
that's
reviewing
the
facts,
that
can
take
the
testimony
of
both
sides,
and
make
a
decision.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
the
disagreement
started--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
--i
believe
after
the
rbd
was
used
for
findings
of
the
delivery
between
1950
and
1961.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
for
that
period
it
directed
them
to
continue
to
perfect
and
to
iron
out
problems
that
were
even
in
that.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
well,
it
anticipated
that
a
river
routing
be
used
and
that
the
river
routing
for
the
findings
for
that
period
be
continually
perfected,
so
it
was
not
saying
here
is
the
yardstick
and
this
is
the
yardstick
we're
using
forever.
it
said
keep
on
working
on
it.
and
that's
where
disagreement
came
and
there
has
been--
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
--there
is
not
a
decision
since
then.
mr.
r.
lambeth
townsend
since
'61.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
using
rbd,
the
findings
did
find
a
substantially
more
than
5,000
acre
feet
as
being
under-delivered,
but
texas
excused
a
substantial
portion...
i
believe
40,000
or
something
in
that
neighborhood...
but
excused
it.
and
so
the
result
was
this
5,000
that
they
didn't
go
forward
with.
so
it
was
not
a
complete...
a
small
amount.
thank
you,
your
honor.
