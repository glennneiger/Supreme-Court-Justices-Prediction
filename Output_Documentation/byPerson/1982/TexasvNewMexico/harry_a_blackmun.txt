in
other
words,
you
feel
we
have
the
power
to
impose
that
tie-breaker
proposition,
even
though
this
is
a
compact
between
states?
justice
harry

blackmun
what
is
the
basic
trouble
with
the
commission?
why
can't
the
states'
representatives
agree?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
certainly
the
compact
is
deficient,
isn't
it,
in
this
respect?
