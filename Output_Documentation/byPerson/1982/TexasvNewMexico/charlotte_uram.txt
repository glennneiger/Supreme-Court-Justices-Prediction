ms.
charlotte
uram
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
justice
stevens,
you
asked
whether
all
sides
agreed
that
the
master
could
make
all
the
necessary
determinations,
and
mr.
townsend
answered
yes,
and
that's
correct,
except
that
the
parties
disagree
on
the
nature
of
the
court's
review
and
the
extent
to
which
it
can
take
action
on
behalf
of
the
commission
or
action
that's
delegated
to
the
commission.
the
court
here
is
presented--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--no,
your
honor.
that
is
where
we
disagree.
ms.
charlotte
uram
the
court
in
this
case
is
presented
with
two
very
different
ways
of
dealing
with
disputes
from
interstate
compact
agencies.
one
way,
new
mexico's
way,
takes
a
standard
administrative
and
statutory
law
approach.
the
compact
is
a
law.
the
commission
is
a
statutory
agency
and
the
court's
review
is
structured,
it
is
limited
accordingly.
the
other
approach,
texas'
approach,
would
require
the
court
to
get
into
the
detail
of
disputes
between
compact
agencies
and
in
instances
rewrite
compacts,
write
rules
and
methods
under
compacts.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct...
not
to
do
the
things
that
texas
asked.
the
master
can
review
the
decision
that
the
commission
made.
there
is
a
particular
decision
that
the
commission
made
that
brought
the
parties
to
the
court
and
was
the
subject
of
this
dispute
for
the
first
eight
years
of
the
case.
ms.
charlotte
uram
there
is
something
for
the
court
to
review
to
resolve
the
dispute.
justice
blackmun
asked
what
the
problem
was
here,
and
the
problem
here
is
that
the
commission
made
a
decision.
that
decision,
the
adoption
of
the
review
of
basic
data,
is
not
a
finding
of
fact.
and
that
decision
is
similar
to
an
administrative
rule,
a
rulemaking
by
an
administrative
agency.
it
sets
the
standard
to
be
applied
to
make
findings
of
fact
and
those
findings
of
fact
go
to
whether
new
mexico
is
delivering
the
correct
amount
of
water
to
texas.
so
the
commission
unanimously...
texas
and
new
mexico
agree...
adopted
this
review
of
basic
data.
in
1974,
over
a
decade
after
the
commission
had
adopted
it
and
begun
drafting
further
documents
based
on
it,
the
state
of
texas
repudiated
the
review
of
basic
data
and
brought
this
law
suit.
the
court
then
went
on
to
determine...
to
make
various
determinations
regarding
the
commission's
authority
to
adopt
the
review
of
basic
data
after
the
court
in
1980
decided
the
commission
had
authority
to
make
such
a
change.
texas
then
raised
dispute
as
to
specific
items
in
the
review
of
basic
data.
she
complained
about
eleven
specific
decisions.
we
are
now
down
to
four.
we
have
only
four
items
remaining
in
that
dispute.
new
mexico
urges
the
court
to
direct
the
master
that
his
role
is
to
review
those
four
remaining
items
as
the
court
reviews
an
administrative
decision.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
what
the
master
said,
and
the
first
time
he
said
it
was
in
1979
in
his
last
report,
but
at
the
time
that
he
said
it
then
he
also
he
had
not
yet
reached
the
consequence
of
that
decision
or
that
issue
and
indeed
there
had
been
no
discussion
of
it
before
1979.
ms.
charlotte
uram
the
review
of
basic
data
may
not
solve
all
the
problems,
but
the
master's
understanding
or
ruling
that
the
review
of
basic
data
was
not
to
be
applied
in
the
future
was
wrong.
the
compact
is
set
up
so
that
there
should
never
be
a
time
when
there
is
not
a
method
to
be
applied.
it
established
a
method
in
the
first
place.
it
said
that
you're
supposed
to
use
the
method
as
to
the
inflow-outflow
method,
as
described
in
the
report
of
the
engineering
advisory
committee.
that
method
should
continue
to
be
used
until
the
commission
changes
it.
the
commission
has
authority
to
change
it.
so
that
method
continues
until
the
commission
changes
it.
the
next
method
continues
until
the
commission
changes
it
again,
and
the
compact
does
not
envision
adoption
of
a
method
to
be
applied
only
for
a
limited
period.
it
is
an
ongoing
administrative
measure,
a
technique,
and
in
fact,
when
you
look
at
what
the
commission
did
here,
the
commission
did
not
say
we
adopt
the
review
of
basic
data
to
be
used
for
findings
of
fact
for
a
12-year
period.
they
had
worked
a
decade
making
the
corrections
in
the
review
of
basic
data
so
that
the
routing
method
could
work.
after
they
worked
a
decade,
they
said
we
adopt
it
for
use
in
all
actions
and
findings,
for
all
actions
and
findings
of
the
commission.
and
then
they
went
on,
clearly
explaining
their
intention
to
use
it
that
way.
they
told
the
committees
to
go
ahead
and
prepare
the
next
set
of
findings
and
prepare
a
draft
inflow-outflow
manual,
both
based
on
the
review
of
basic
data.
so
the
master
erred
when
he
said
that
the
review
of
basic
data
was
intended
to
be
used
only
until
1962
and
certainly
the
first
eight
years
of
this
litigation
indicate
that
everyone
understood
that
the
review
of
basic
data
was
still
the
subject
of
this
suit.
it
was...
the
entire
pre-trial
order
is
written
toward
the
early
phases,
the
question
whether
the
commission
acted
within
its
authority
to
adopt
it,
and
then
whether
certain
technical
portions
are
valid.
ms.
charlotte
uram
no.
texas
is
asking
that
the
master
come
in
and
make
those
kinds
of
determinations.
the
determinations
of
how
you
translate
the
1947
condition,
what
standard
or
method
you
use,
are
contained
in
the
review
of
basic
data.
the
master's
role
in
an
administrative
law
context,
which
is
the
one
new
mexico
urges
as
the
appropriate
one
here,
is
to
review
the
method
and
say
whether
it
is
valid
within
the
statute...
a
standard,
traditional
type
of
judicial
function.
instead--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--you're
correct,
your
honor.
ordinarily--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--yes.
it
says
findings
of
fact
are
reviewable
in
court.
ms.
charlotte
uram
no.
it
says
in
courts
or
in
administrative
agencies
findings
of
fact
are
prima
facie
evidence.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
probably
true,
your
honor.
but
the...
this
compact,
you
will
recall,
was
signed
in
1948
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
signed
only
two
years...
was
enacted
only
two
years
before.
in
modern
compacts
one
will
see
a
good
deal
of
the
type
of
language
one
sees
in
the
administrative
procedure
act,
with
specifications
as
to
period
for
review
and
so
forth.
but
certainly
in
an
early
compact
like
this,
the
language
will
be
somewhat
different.
but
the
basic
framework
is
the
same.
the...
since
world
war
ii
particularly
we
have
been
seeing
an
increase
in
the
growth
of
compacts
and
these
compacts
have
had
interstate
agencies
charged
with
positive
powers.
those
compacts
have
not
simply
been
an
adjustment
of
a
one-time
dispute.
they
have
positive
inter-governmental
powers,
and
the
question
is
how
is
the
court
going
to
deal
with
disputes
from
these
agencies.
ms.
charlotte
uram
in
some
instances,
they
do.
for
example,
the
washington
metropolitan
area
transit
authority
compact,
the
one
that
governs
transportation
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
specifies
that
review
from
certain
types
of
things
shall
go
to
one
type
of
court
and
review
from
other
types
of
things
will
go
to
another
type
of
court.
ms.
charlotte
uram
i
don't
recall
that
they
do.
but
what
we
have
here
is
we
have
a
situation
where
undoubtedly
there
will
be
disputes
between
states
on
how
these...
on
decisions
that
these
agencies
make,
and
if
those
disputes
are
brought
to
this
court,
the
question
is
how
should
the
court
deal
with
this.
should
the
court
be
called
upon
to
jump
in
and
make
all
the
findings
that
are
delegated
by
the
compacts
to
commissions?
is
that
the
correct
role
of
the
court?
or
is
it,
rather,
to
take
that
great
body
of
administrative
law
which
has
been
developed
in
the
last
40
or
50
years
and
use
the
principles
there
to--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--well,
the
standard...
i
would
think
the
appropriate
standard
would
be
the
one
that
the
court
used
to
apply
before
it
had
statutes
such
as
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
court
would
look
to
whether
the
action
is
constitutional,
whether
it
complies
with
the
statute,
whether
it
was
done
properly
under
the
procedures
in
the
statute,
and
whether
it
was
reasonable.
so
there
are...
there
are
standards
to
look
to.
they
are
basically
in
the
compact,
and
we
urge
the
court
that
the
states
here,
they
agreed
to
shoulder
these
responsibilities
themselves.
ms.
charlotte
uram
well,
we
have
here
a
special
situation.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
we
have
a
decision
to
be
reviewed
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
reason--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--oh,
well,
you
see,
your
honor,
the
situation
is
really
a
little
simpler
than
it
looks.
there
is
a
lot
of
detail
in
the
case
and
it
does
give
one
the
impression
that
the
situation's
more
complicated
than
it
appears
to
be.
ms.
charlotte
uram
yes.
ms.
charlotte
uram
yes.
the
master--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--well,
because
texas
says
that...
texas
tells
the
court
not
to
look
at
those
four
issues
any
more
but
to
choose
another
method.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct.
ms.
charlotte
uram
we
say
the
master--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--we
agree
on
the
same
four
issues.
the
place
where
we
part
is
that
texas
says
the
master
can
substitute
another
method,
one
that's
never
been
brought
before
the
commission,
for
the
method
that
the
commission
decided
on.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct.
but
then
we
part
again.
ms.
charlotte
uram
because
new
mexico
says
after
you've
made
this
basic
decision
the
dispute
will
be
resolved
and
the
matter
should
go
back
to
the
commission
for
administration.
the
appropriate
body
to
make
corrections
in
the
review
of
basic
data
is
the
commission.
the
court
says
what
is
invalid,
if
anything's
invalid
in
those
four
remaining
disputes,
and
then
sends
it
back
to
the
commission
for
correction.
texas--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--the
commission
adopted
the
review
of
basic
data.
these
four
issues
are
challenges
to
the
review
of
basic
data.
ms.
charlotte
uram
and,
justice
white,
i
don't
even
know
if
these
four
issues
remain,
because
texas
in
open
court
before
the
master
said
that
if
she
had
a
hearing
on
the
double
mass
method
she
would
waive
any
remaining
issues
on
the
review
of
basic
data.
so
if
this
case
goes
back
to
the
master
and
takes
an
administrative
law
rather
than
an
open-ended
approach,
the
master
would
not
then
have
to
go
on
and
make
findings
of
fact
and
determine
how
much
water
was
at
a
certain
point
at
a
certain
time.
that
would
not
be
his
responsibility.
that
would
be
the
responsibility
of
the
commission.
the
matter
should
then
be
remanded
to
the
commission.
ms.
charlotte
uram
let's
take
the...
if
the
matter
is
remanded
to
the
commission,
in
1980
texas
counsel
said
that
if
new
mexico
prevailed
on
the
review
of
basic
data
there
would
be
no
problem
working
things
out
because
texas
would
abide
by
that
decision.
so
all
the
commission
would
have
to
do,
if
everything
works
as
it
should,
is
proceed
with
the...
to
apply
the
review
of
basic
data
to
make
findings
of
fact
to
the
present.
it
could
also
proceed
to
consider
the
double
mass
diagram
if
texas
chooses
to
bring
it
before
the
commission.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct.
there
would
be
additional
engineering
and
other
types
of
decisions
that
would
need
to
be
made.
now
let's
take--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--they
had
a
dis...
it's
not
a
situation
where
they've
been
unable
to
agree.
the
language
of
impasse
and
deadlock
has
made
the
problem
sound
as
if
it
is
an
extraordinary
problem
we
have
here,
and
certainly
unanimity
does
cause
some
additional
delays
and
problems,
but
the
problem
here
is--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--the
problem
here
is--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--yes
and
no.
ms.
charlotte
uram
yes.
ms.
charlotte
uram
yes,
because
what
happened--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--because
one
of
them
questioned
the
commission's
authority
to
do
what
it
had
done,
and
questioned
the
validity
of
what
was
done.
if
the
court
completes
judicial
review
and
it
completed
the
first
phase...
yes,
there
is
authority...
the
second
phase
is,
is
it
otherwise
valid.
if
the
court
completes
it,
the
commission
has
its
answer.
this
is
what
the
commission
fell
into
dispute
about.
the
commission
agreed
to
something.
it
continued
to
operate
that
something
for
a
time.
then
one
of
the
parties
decided
that
in
fact
it
no
longer
agreed
with
its
earlier
agreement,
and
it
brought
various
claims
that
were
legitimate
legal
claims
to
the
court.
the
court
should
review
those
legitimate
legal
claims.
in
the
meantime,
the
commission
hasn't
acted
and
it
has
been
a
long
suit.
so
increasingly,
as
time
goes
on,
everyone
gets
more
concerned
about
the
impasse
and
the
deadlock
on
the
commission.
well,
the
problem's
a
fundamental
one.
if
we
could
resolve
this
fundamental
problem,
which
is
nearly
completed,
the
commission
would
at
least
have
its
answer
to
the
first
phase,
to
the
thing
that
blocked
the
commission.
they
worked
for
20
years.
they
were
able
to
agree
for
20
years,
and
they
had
problems
then.
but
they
were
able
to
agree.
they
came
to
the
review
of
basic
data
and
they
agreed
upon
it.
now
we
have--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--judge,
this
has
been
a
very
difficult
case
for
the
special
master.
the
parties
have
been
pulling
the
special
master
in
many
directions
and
i'm
sure
with
the
degree
of
detail
it's
been
frustrating
for
him.
but
we
have
had
some
conceptual
difficulties
in
recent
times,
but
particularly
with
where
the
case
is
going.
part
of
the
problem
is
the
issue
of
unanimity,
and
the
court
has
indicated
a
concern
as
well.
what
does
unanimity
do
here?
why
is
it
in
the
compact?
isn't
it
going
to
create
distortions
in
the
way
these
compacts
work?
and
perhaps
i
can
take
just
a
moment
to
discuss
the
two
reasons
for
having
unanimity
in
the
compact
and
then
discuss
a
worst
case
situation...
what
happens
if
the
states
simply
do
not
agree
when
you
get
back
to
it.
the
obvious
reason
for
having
a
unanimity
requirement
in
the
compact
and,
as
counsel
for
texas
correctly
pointed
out,
that's
a
common
requirement
in
interstate
water
compacts.
but
the
common
reason
is
that
the
states
here
are
delegating
to
an
administrative
body
the
authority
to
make
decisions
that
will
affect
those
states
in
the
future,
and
they
will
agree
to
do
this
interstate
cooperation.
it
is
in
everyone's
interest,
but
at
the
same
time
they
want
to
protect
their
citizens
and
their
sovereignty.
so
the
way
that
they
retain
control
of
the
obvious
state
protection
is
in
this
unanimity
requirement.
the
delegation
here
to
the
commission
was
unusual
for
its
time.
in
its
day,
it
was
unusual
to
have
a
commission
given
the
authority
to
change
the
method
for
administering
the
compact.
so
one
can
see
that
the
states
had
some
concern
that
they
not
be
bound
in
ten
or
20
or
50
years
by
something
they
have
no
say
over.
the
other
reason
for
unanimity
requirement
is
one
suggested
by
the
scholars
in
the
field.
interstate
relations
are
different
from
other
kinds
of
relations,
and
to
the
extent
that
they
succeed,
they
succeed
on
the
basis
of
cooperation.
so
what
compacts
try
to
do
when
they
require
unanimity
is
to
set
up
a
way
that
the
compact
will
work.
now
texas
has
said
that
there's
no
enforcement
mechanism
here.
the
legislative
history
in
senate
document
109
at
page
124
indicates
that
it
was
anticipated
that
when
the
states
came
to
a
finding
the
upstream
state,
new
mexico,
if
it
was
not
delivering
sufficient
water,
would
then
proceed
voluntarily,
without
any
court
enforcement,
to
go
and
make
the
necessary
decisions
under
the
compact
to
shut
certain
users
down.
the
unanimity
requirement
is
tied
with
other
measures
to
push
the
states
to
come
to
such
agreement,
and
the
measures
here
are
the
binding
nature
of
the
compact
and
the
difficulty
of
getting
out
of
it.
the
states
had
had
disputes
for
30
years--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--if...
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
quite
understand.
ms.
charlotte
uram
well,
let's
apply
it
to
this
specific
situation,
and
i
disagree
with
the
characterization,
your
honor,
that
it
is
ineffectual.
i
think
it's
set
up
to
function
in
a
different
way
than
modern
statutes
because
of
the
interstate
nature
of
the
disputes.
but
applying
the
notion
to
this
particular
situation,
is
new
mexico,
as
an
upstream
state,
in
an
position
where
she
should
be
happy
with
the
compact.
she
is
satisfied
with
the
compact,
but
lest
the
court
be
confused
about
what
new
mexico's
doing
under
the
compact,
she
limited
her
uses
to
the
1947
condition.
she
made
a
compromise
and
she
has
been
shutting
down
users.
she
has
been
controlling
use
on
that
river.
she
shut
down
about
14,000
acres
in
the
1950s
and
'60s
to
comply
with
the
compact.
when
people
use
water
illegally
we
have
a
special
master,
we
have
metered
wells
in
that
area.
that
is
an
unusual
requirement.
we
go
out
and
we
track
violation
and
we
enforce
this
requirement.
we
take
our
statutory
obligation
very
seriously
and
we...
that
is
why
we
are
before
the
court
asking
for
it
and
trying
to
explain
our
view
that
the
court
really
can't
change
a
requirement
on
us
50
years
down
the
road
or
40
years
down
the
road,
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
only
the
commission
can
change
a
requirement.
what
the
court's
role
is
is
to
review
the
commission
dispute
that
brought
the
parties
to
the
court.
ms.
charlotte
uram
and
the--
ms.
charlotte
uram
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
stalemate
is
something
that
may
cause
a
problem
to
texas.
it
may
shortchange
texas
if
new
mexico
is
not
delivering
the
correct
amount
of
water
to
texas.
we
are
not
taking
advantage
of
that
situation,
though,
your
honor.
i
assure
you
that
new
mexico
has
continued
to
enforce
the
1947
condition
obligation
as
she
understands
it,
and
if
the
commission...
and
as
the
commission
decided,
you
know,
we're
relying
on
the
commission's
earlier
decision
which
we
have
been
defending
all
through
the
law
suit.
ms.
charlotte
uram
it's
a
total
of
5,000
acre
feet,
but
it
did
not
go
on
to
decide
that
new
mexico
was
responsible
for
that
shortage.
ms.
charlotte
uram
well,
they
didn't
make
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other.
that's
an
unusually
small
amount
of
deficiency,
but
that
indicated
to
new
mexico
that
she
was
doing
something
right.
if
upon
completion
of
judicial
review
it
turns
out
that
new
mexico
was
doing
something
wrong,
new
mexico...
let's
say
the
master
reviews
the
remaining
issues
and
says
that
certain
things
were
done
improperly.
the
commission
then
goes
on,
having
the
benefit
of
judicial
resolution
of
that
particular
dispute.
let's
say
the
commission
goes
on
to
make
the
further
determinations.
then
the
situation
would
be
one
where
new
mexico
would
say
all
right,
we
have
a
deficit
of
this
amount
and
would
then
proceed
to
take
the
necessary
action
to
shut
down
users
on
the
river,
as
required
by
the
deficit.
ms.
charlotte
uram
that's
correct.
ms.
charlotte
uram
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
the
rest.
ms.
charlotte
uram
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
they
did.
the
difference
here...
we
had
a
term
to
be
interpreted
there,
a
1947
condition,
and
there
was
a
question
of
when
it
began
and
whether
it
was
a
real
or
artificial
condition.
did
it
begin
on
december
1,
december
30,
march
20?
was
it
a
condition
that
was
meant
to
be
reflected
on
the
river,
or
was
it
a
condition
technically
defined
somewhere
regardless
of
what
the
real
condition
was?
so
there
the
court
was
defining
a
particular
term.
the
difference
here
is
that
texas
is
asking
the
court
not
to
define
a
particular
term
in
a
statute
but
go
to
into
uncharted
areas
and
regardless
of
what
the
compact
requires
require
a
tie-breaker
or
require
a
new
method
or
make
certain
findings
that
are
delegated
to
the
commission.
so
it's
not
a
matter
of
interpreting,
which
is
a
standard
judicial
function.
it
is
a
matter
of
taking
on
the
entire
administration
of
the
compact
and
rewriting
it,
as
texas
sees
fit
as
well.
so
that
is
the
basic
dichotomy
in
the
presentation
of
the
two
states.
it's
two
completely
different
ways
of...
two
completely
different
ideas
of
what
the
court's
role
should
be
in
interstate
compact
commission
disputes.
new
mexico
asks
the
court
not
to
take
that
broader
role
and
throw
itself
into
the
suit
as
if
this
were
an
equitable
apportionment
suit,
when
it
is
in
fact
a
compact
suit,
to
recognize
that
the
states
agreed
to
shoulder
that
responsibility
under
the
compact.
they
agreed
to
do
that.
they
agreed
that
the
compact
would
be
binding
and
that
agreement
is
something
which
new
mexico,
as
i
indicated
before,
has
tried
to
honor
through
all
the
years
of
this
dispute.
new
mexico
asks
the
court
to
put
this
case
back
on
course
first
by
recognizing
the
binding
nature
of
the
interstate
compact,
secondly
by
giving
structure
and
form
to
judicial
review
in
interstate
compact
commission
cases
and,
third,
by
returning
the
appropriate
responsibility
to
the
administrative
compact...
by
returning
the
responsibility
under
the
compact
to
the
appropriate
administrative
body,
which
is
the
commission.
thank
you.
