justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
right
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
that
what
the
tie-breaker
would
do
would
be
to
resolve
disputes
on
some
of
these
underlying
findings,
how
much
water
was
available
in
1947
and
so
forth?
is
there
any
issue
that
you
would
submit
to
the
tie-breaker
that
the
master
could
not
himself
decide
if
he
didn't
suggest
that
he
wasn't...
didn't
have
the
expertise
to
do
so?
he
has
this
rather
strange
paragraph
in
his
opinion,
that
it's
an
awfully
tough
case
and
he
doesn't
have
the
expertise
to
decide
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
that
both
sides
really
are
in
agreement
on
that,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
the
only
person
who's
balking
is
the
master.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
united
states
says
the
same
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many
days
has
he
actually
spent
in
hearings
on
this
case
since
it
was
last
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
during
those
hearings
have
you...
have
they
been
spent
receiving
evidence
or
has
a
lot
of
the
time
been
devoted
to
negotiation
and
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
didn't
rest
exclusively
on
your
double
mass
analysis,
as
i
understood
it.
you
had
an
alternative
theory
of
how
to
figure
out
the
numbers,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that...
evidence
pertaining
to
that
is
in
the
record,
but
there's
no
resolution--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
do
you
understand
the
result
of
the
first
report
in
this
court's
decision,
the
last
time
the
case
was
here,
that
entirely
repudiated
the
report
of
the
engineering
advisory
committee
or
just
said
it
shouldn't
be
controlling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
one
of
the
problems
is
getting
an
understanding
of
some
of
the
basic
underlying
facts...
how
much
water...
how
much
of
the
water
was
flowing
in
1947
and
so
forth?
and
the
commission
is
supposed
to
make
some
of
those
findings
and
has
been
unable
to
do
so.
is
it
not
correct
the
master
could
make
those
factual
findings
if
he
would
decide
between
the
contending
parties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
all
the
examples
you
give
are
situations
in
which
there
is
a
neutral
factfinder
or
a
neutral
administrative
law
judge
of
some
kind
to
start
with?
here
you
have
a
situation
in
which
there
are
two
parties,
either
of
which
can
veto
the
findings,
and
if
you
have
a
situation
in
which
one
decides
to
be
obstinant...
and
i'm
not
suggesting
either
has...
and
just
doesn't
agree
to
anything,
you
simply
can't
apply
the
principles
you
describe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
one
of
the
initial
problems
is
you
have
a
lot
of
decisions
that
haven't
even
been
made
in
the
first
instance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
identified
four
specific
controversies
that
remain
unresolved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
is
it
possible
that
the
master
could,
if
he
felt
himself
qualified
to
do
so,
could
have
decided
each
of
those
four
issues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
do
we
have
to
worry
about
administrative
review?
isn't
it
just
a
question
of
somebody
going
ahead
and
making
the
decisions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
agreed
a
few
minutes
ago
that
the
master
simply
hadn't
decided
some
things
that
would
have
moved
the
case
along.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
seem
to
be
saying
the
same
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
identify
different
issues.
i
understand
that,
but
apparently
he
hasn't
decided
any
of
these
issues.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
also
have
an
alternative
position,
that
even
if
he
doesn't
buy
the
double
mass
analysis
argument,
go
ahead
and
use
the
routing
approach.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
won't
get
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
having
said
all
that...
and
i'm
sure
the
state
is
acting
in
good
faith...
it
nevertheless
remains
true
that
even
in
good
faith
you
may
be
shortchanging
the
downstream
state,
because
they
obviously
in
good
faith
think
they're
getting
less
water
than
the
compact
calls
for.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
there's
a
stalemate,
that
can't
help
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
decision
showed
there
had
been
some
shortage,
5,300
acre
feet,
and
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--was
it
attributable
to
man's
activities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
your
basic
position
is
the
court
can't
rewrite
the
compact,
in
your
exception.
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
the
court
do
exactly
that
a
few
years
ago?
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
the
court
do
exactly
that
a
few
years
ago
in
accepting
the
master's
redefinition
of
the
1947
condition?
