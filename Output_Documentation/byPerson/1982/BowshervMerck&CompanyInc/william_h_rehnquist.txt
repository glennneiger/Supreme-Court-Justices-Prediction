justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
that
prevents
the
comptroller
general
from
getting
everything
it
needs,
you're
not
suggesting
that
congress
in
heik
verba
said
the
comptroller
general
can
have
whatever
he
needs
in
a
situation
like
this,
are
you?
justice
rehnquist
and
your
contention
is
that
the
way
these
costs
are
allocated,
you
would
have
virtually
unlimited
access
to
anything
because
of
the
way
the
funds
come
into
the
drug
companies?
justice
rehnquist
but
when
you
say
"records
of
non-government
work",
wouldn't...
because
of
the
non-allocation
of
costs,
wouldn't
you
necessarily
get
a
fair
amount
of
records
of
non-government
work
under
your
theory
that
you
are
entitled
to
any
records
that
are...
or
any
records
of
any
products
that
are
paid
for
out
of
government
funds,
whatever
it
is
your
claim?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
well,
you
say
"co-mingle"
as
if
it
is
some
sort
of
sin,
but
i--
justice
rehnquist
--well,
suppose
they
have
developed
a
product
like,
say,
bufferin.
i
don't
know
whether
they
develop
it
or
somebody
else
does.
but
they
develop
a
product
like
bufferin,
sell
it
on
the
market,
and
never
sell
any
of
it...
or
say
that
they
sell
one
percent
of
it
to
the
government
under
a
negotiated
product
contract,
99
percent
on
the
open
market.
is
it
your
contention
you
can
have
access
to
all
of
the
records
dealing
with
bufferin?
justice
rehnquist
would
that
include
all
sort
of
unallocated
expenses
engaged
in
research
and
development?
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
"would
address
it",
it
would
take
it
in,
wouldn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
how
is
this
going
to
help
the
comptroller
general?
he
probably
has
a
right
to
lots
of
things,
maybe
even
if
they
don't
help
him,
but
at
least
part
of
your
argument
seems
to
be
that
it's
going
to
be
of
genuine
assistance
to
get
these
figures.
how
is
it
going
to
help
the
comptroller
general
in
advising
the
agencies
whether
or
not
to
purchase
from
merck
or
congress
whether
to
pass
some
law
specifying
purchasing
policies
how
much
merck
spends
on
advertising?
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
something
they
do
when
they
are
told
to
do
by
a
court
or
when
they
are
trying
to
plead
a
case.
justice
rehnquist
right.
but
now
certainly
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
comptroller
general
has
the
same
authority
to
tell
them
to
allocate.
justice
rehnquist
you're
saying
give
us
the
information
and
we
will
allocate.
justice
rehnquist
who
would
enforce
the
confidentiality
order...
the
comptroller
general's
office?
justice
rehnquist
can
you
subpoena
post-1980
records
of
merck
now
under
the
1980
amendment?
justice
rehnquist
has
the
comptroller
general
started
doing
it?
justice
rehnquist
so
really
the
1980
act
doesn't
give
you
anything,
i
guess,
that
you
don't
have
now.
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
a
little
bit
like
a
prosecutor
saying
"we
don't
think
we
have
much
cause
to
prosecute
x.
"
and
then
a
senator
calls
up
the
prosecutor
and
the
prosecutor
says,
"okay,
we're
going
to
go
ahead
and
prosecute
x..
"
a
court
looks
at
the
merits
of
that
sort
of
a
claim.
they
don't
go
into
all
the
motivations
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
rehnquist
but
is
mr.
bowsher
bound
by
mr.
staats'
subjective
feelings
on
the
thing?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lacovara,
you
haven't
yet
covered
in
your
oral
argument,
have
you,
your
objections
to
what
the
district
court
did
give
to
the
comptroller
general?
justice
rehnquist
well,
no,
i
just
meant
to
keep
track
of
you
in
a
way.
