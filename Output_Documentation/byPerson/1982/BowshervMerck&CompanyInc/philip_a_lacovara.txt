mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
statutory
construction
case.
the
argument
that
has
just
been
presented
on
behalf
of
the
government
emphasizes
why
the
comptroller
general
or
his
counsel
today
believes
that
it
might
be
a
fine
idea
for
the
comptroller
general
to
have
access
to
the
extensive
cost
records
of
government
contractors,
even
where
costs
played
no
part
in
the
negotiation
or
pricing
of
the
contract
for
the
goods
sold
to
the
government.
that
position
may
make
sense.
it
may
not
make
sense
as
a
matter
of
policy.
i
don't
know
what
the
right
answer
to
that
question
is.
all
i
know
is
that
in
1972
before
he
was
finally
forced
into
pursuing
this
exercise,
when,
as
the
third
circuit
recently
put
it,
he
concluded...
"he",
the
comptroller
general...
that
he
had
no
viable
option
but
to
do
what
senator
nelson
had
urged
him,
the
comptroller
general
personally
testified
before
senator
nelson's
committee
that
this
very
exercise
would
be,
in
his
words,
"a
waste
of
time".
and
he
said
at
that
point...
and
the
passage
is
quoted
on
pages
three
and
four
of
our
brief...
that
since
the
government
always
buys
pharmaceutical
products
below
the
cost
at
which
these
products
are
sold
in
substantial
quantities
to
the
general
public,
he,
as
he
put
it,
"found
it
a
little
hard
on
its
face
to
say
that
the
government
is
not
getting
good
prices.
"
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
this
case
is
a
little
bit
different
because
we're
talking
here
about
the
use
of
a
coercive
power
given
under
a
statute
that
we
think
was
given
by
congress
for
a
very
limited
purpose.
the
purpose
was,
as
the
legislative
history
would
show
and
i
think
the
language
of
the
statute
would
show,
to
allow
the
comptroller
general
to
conduct
audits
of
individual
contracts
to
see
whether
the
parties
on
either
side
had
abused
the
process.
the
comptroller
general
said
that
was
not
something
that
he
thought
he
was
interested
in
doing
in
this
industry,
or
something
that
he
thought
would
be
useful.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
it's
not
quite
whether
he's
bound
by
that,
justice
rehnquist,
but
whether
or
not
when
one
passes
beyond
the
scope
of
access
that
the
government
is
demanding
one
gets
to
the
question
whether
this
was
a
bona
fide
or
legitimate
inquiry
in
the
first
place.
there
is
case
law.
lasalle
national
bank
is
one
such
case...
there
are
others,
of
course,
in
the
lower
courts...
in
which
this
court
and
others
have
said
that
if
demand
for
access
to
private
records
under
summons
power
or
subpoena
powers
or
otherwise
is
not
motivated
by
the
purpose
for
which
that
power
was
granted,
then
the
demand
should
not
be
enforced.
i
do
want
to
emphasize,
though,
that
is
not
the
principal
point
of
merck's
argument
here
this
afternoon.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
your
honor,
no,
we
would
not.
that
is--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--exactly.
if
the
price
of
the
contract
had
been
negotiated
on
the
basis
of
cost,
because
merck
represented
that
it
would
incur
a
certain
level
of
costs
in
performing
the
contract,
or
if
the
contract
price
itself
was
left
open
to
be
based
upon
the
costs
actually
incurred,
then
there
is
no
question
whatsoever
that
that
would
be
within
the
traditional
audit
function
that
the
comptroller
general
has
and
that
this
access
statute
permits
him
to
enforce.
that,
however,
is
not
what
we
have
here
today.
i'm
not
sure
whether
merck
has
any
cost-plus
contracts
with
the
government.
i
rather
doubt
that
it
does.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
there
are
any
such
contracts,
and
one
would
have
thought
that
if
there
had
been
any
the
comptroller
general,
knowing
that
this
whole
dispute
concerned
the
industry's
position
that
cost
records
are
highly
confidential
and
that
they
are
not
relevant
to
non-cost-based
records,
if
the
comptroller
knew
of
any
such
cost-based
contracts
in
the
industry
he
would
have
selected
those
as
the
predicate
for
his
access
demands.
he
didn't,
and
what
we
have
here
is
an
access
demand
that
lists
four
specific,
non-cost-based
contracts,
all
of
which
the
government
admits
are
for
standard
commercial
items
sold
to
the
general
public
at
catalog
prices
or
otherwise
based
on
prices
that
are
set
in
the
competitive
marketplace.
i
might
at
this
point
pick
up
on
one
of
the
colloquies
that
was
held
during
my
colleague's
discussion
with
the
court
about
whether
the
gao
has
any
belief
or
any
suspicion
that
the
prices
for
these
contracts
were
not
reasonable
in
any
sense.
the
gao,
when
it
answered
interrogatories,
expressly
denied
that
it
had
any
reason
to
suspect
any
impropriety
in
any
part
of
the
negotiation
process
or
had
any
reason
to
doubt
the
reasonableness
of
the
price.
when
the
senior
gao
official
who
is
involved
in
this
matter,
mr.
ahart,
the
director
of
the
manpower
and
welfare
division,
was
being
deposed,
i
asked
him
the
question.
is
there
any
specific
reason
to
believe
that
merck
made
excessive
or
unreasonable
profits
on
any
of
the
four
contracts
in
question?
this
is
page
76-a
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
answer
in
full
is:
"no.
"
"the
general
accounting
office
has
no
reason
to
believe
that
merck
made
unreasonable
or
excessive
profits
on
the
four
contracts.
"
all
of
this,
however,
should
be
considered,
i
think,
in
the
context--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--pardon
me?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
secret,
justice
stevens,
is
that
the
government
wants
not
the
records
that
merck
has
offered,
which
are
the
records
to
show
that
the
prices
that
were
agreed
upon
in
these
contracts
were
actually
based
upon
catalog
prices
at
which
these
products
were
sold
to
the
government.
they
have
said
under
this
statute,
which
has,
we
think,
not
only
limited
language
but
a
purpose,
a
background
of
legislative
intent
that
shows
a
narrow
range
of
authority,
that
they
want
access
to
all
of
merck's
cost
records,
except
to
the
extent...
and
it's
a
little
hard
to
pin
down
precisely
what
the
theory
is
since
it
has
shifted
a
bit...
except
to
the
extent,
as
we
understand
it...
and
this
picks
up
on
justice...
judge
mikva's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
lower
court...
that
merck
bears
the
burden
of
showing
that
costs
are
specifically
allocated
by
the
company
to
some
other
product.
now
that's
an
interesting
inversion
of
the
statutory
language,
which
says
the
comptroller
general
may
only
get
access
to
records
that
are
directly
pertinent
to
and
involve
transactions
relating
to
a
specific
contract.
what
that
means,
justice
stevens,
in
this
case
is
that
since
these
clauses
must
be
included
in
any
contract
for
the
purchase
of
more
than
$10,000
in
goods,
even
for
off-the-shelf
kinds
of
standard
commercial
items,
under
the
government's
theory...
and
this
is
the
way
it
has
expressly
articulated
it
again
this
afternoon...
the
government,
through
the
gao,
is
entitled
to
examine
all
of
the
costs
that
merck
has
incurred
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time...
mr.
ahart
said
maybe
as
much
as
20
years.
merck,
in
a
year
in
which
these
contracts
were
signed,
had
costs
of
about
$1
billion,
including
about
$100
million
in
research
and
development
costs.
today,
the
numbers
have
jumped
to
over
$2
billion
for
general
costs
and
$300
million
for
research
and
development.
the
government's
theory
is
that
it's
entitled
to
access
to
all
of
those
costs
under
this
authority.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
what
we
would
do
on
a
cooperative
basis,
justice
stevens,
is
another
matter.
as
you
know
from
looking
at
the
record
here,
merck
was
one
of
the
companies
that
came
forward
voluntarily
when
gao
was
interested
in
doing
an
economic
study
and
we
said
we
will
give
you
access
to
a
lot
of
information
if
you'll
keep
it
confidential.
the
record
makes
perfectly
clear,
as
every
court
that
has
addressed
this
question
has
recognized,
that
the
gao
said
it
was
prepared
to
give
the
industry
this
kind
of
commitment
of
confidentiality
for
some
of
the
reasons
that
emerged
in
the
chief
justice's
colloquy
with
opposing
counsel.
but
senator
nelson
and
his
staff
said
we
want
you
to
get
individual
product
cost
information
to
give
to
us
so
that
we
can
disclose
it.
it's
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
ahart
testified
that
the
only
reason
the
gao
did
not
give
the
confidentiality
pledge
when
merck
and
the
other
companies
said
they
would
produce
the
costs
was
the
refusal
of
the
senators
to
accede
to
it.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
one
concern.
when
we
filed
the
complaint,
justice
stevens,
we
said
that
the
scope
of
the
demand
made
by
the
comptroller
general
proposed
to
injure
merck
in
two
respects.
one
was
the
danger
to
the
confidentiality
of
this
information,
and
it
is
highly
important,
as
i
think
the
chief
justice's
question
suggested,
whether
competitors
know
how
a
particular
pharmaceutical
company
is
concentrating
its
research
and
development
activities.
that
is
of
enormous
use.
industrial
intelligence
is
highly
specialized
in
this
way.
but
the
other
purpose
that
we
said
motivated
the
suit
to
block
the
sweeping
access
that
was
demanded
was
the
sheer
cost
and
burden.
this
is
not
simply
a
counsel's
flight
of
fancy
or
a
parade
of
horribles
constructed
for
litigation.
the
record
shows
that,
as
my
opposed
counsel
said,
one
of
the
six
companies
on
whom
these
demands
were
simultaneously
served
decided
it
would
try
to
acquiesce
rather
than
fight.
that
was
hoffman-laroche.
it
allowed
access
in
july
1975.
when
i
asked
mr.
ahart
on
deposition
what
was
the
status
of
that
inquiry,
he
testified...
and
this
can
be
found
in
the
joint
appendix...
that
the...
a
team
of
gao
auditors
had
been
on
site
at
hoffman-laroche's
headquarters
for
15
months
and
were
expected
to
be
there
a
few
more
months.
it
turned
out
that
in
july
1975,
two
years
later,
the
team
was
still
there,
and
after
some
of
the
lower
courts
began
to
rule
that
the
gao
had
overstepped
its
bounds,
hoffman-laroche
finally
said
enough
is
enough.
that
would
appear
on
joint
appendix
127-a,
justice
stevens.
so
what
we
have
here
is
a
demonstrated
track
record
that
if
gao
has
what
it
claims
in
this
case
it
can
send
teams
of
accountants
to
live
at
the
headquarters
of
a
contractor,
spend
years
there...
far
more
than
outside
auditors
find
it
necessary
to
spend
time
to
do
the
annual
certifications
for
the
sec.
i
think
that
makes
it
perfectly
evident
that
the
position
of
contractors
like
merck
and
the
others
that
this
demand
is
not
only
abstractly
in
excess
of
the
gao's
legal
authority
but
is
in
fact
a
real
substantial
threat
to
the
company's
functioning.
now
opposing
counsel
also
said
that
we
in
our
reply
brief
had
mistakenly
said
that
the
gao
had
opposed
a
confidentiality
provision
in
this
case.
in
fact,
i
think
the
court
should
be
aware,
looking
at
record
reference
58,
when
merck
moved
for
the
addition
of
confidentiality
provisions
to
the
judgment,
a
motion
that
was
subsequently
granted,
the
gao
opposed
that
motion,
saying
it
was
prepared
to
agree
to
confidentiality
only
if
the
district
court
granted
the
full
relief
that
the
government
had
been
seeking,
but
that
since
the
district
court
had
allowed
access
only
to
direct
production
cost
records
the
government
thought
that
it
should
be
under
no
obligation
to
preserve
the
confidentiality
of
those
records.
so
i
refer
the
court
for
this
i
think
largely
irrelevant
dispute
to
record
item
58.
the
key
point,
though,
in
this
case
is
that
it's
a
statutory
construction
case.
the
statute
printed
in
the
government's
certiorari
petition
has
in
it
at
least
four
explicit
terms
of
limitation.
page
two
of
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
says,
in
relevant
part,
"the
comptroller
general
and
his
representatives
are
entitled.
"
--first
limitation...
"until
the
expiration
of
three
years
after
final
payment
to
examine
any
books
or
papers.
"
--that
is
number
two...
"directly
pertaining
to"...
number
three...
"and
involved
transactions
relating
to"...
and
then,
number
four...
"the
contract".
in
the
clause
that
implements
this
statutory
requirement,
which
is
in
the
record
and
is
also
quoted
in
the
government's
answer
to
the
complaint
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
government
has
refined
that
to
make
it
clear
that
access
is
to
be
granted
only
to
records
that
are
directly
pertinent
to
and
involving
transactions
relating
to
this
contract.
so
if
the
english
language
means
anything,
it
means
that
both
the
statutory
grant
of
authority
and
the
contract
clause
which
implements
the
authority
focus
directly,
narrowly,
specifically
on
the
transactions
involving
that
contract.
that,
we
think,
logically,
naturally
suggests
that
what
the
government
is
entitled
to
are
records
relating
to
the
negotiation
of
the
contract,
the
performance
of
the
contract,
and
the
support
for
payment
under
the
contract.
other
procurement
statutes
make
that
pattern
manifest.
we
refer
to
three
or
four
of
them...
the
renegotiation
act,
the
truth
in
negotiations
act,
the
agency
access
statute
enacted
in
1968
to
give
the
agencies,
as
the
congress
was
told,
the
same
power
of
access
that
the
gao
had
been
given
in
1951,
and
the
cost
account...
the
government
cost
accounting
standards
statute.
all
of
those
are
congressional
manifestations
of
the
view
that
where
a
product
being
sold
to
the
government
is
a
standard
commercial
item
sold
to
the
general
public
at
a
catalog
price
or
in
some
other
competitive
setting,
the
government
does
not
have
any
legitimate
interest
in
knowing
what
the
contractor's
costs
are.
the
government's
interests,
as
the
comptroller
general
testified
in
1972,
are
protected
when
the
government
is
assured...
and
merck
is
prepared
to
give
these
records
to
the
gao...
that
the
price
at
which
the
government
purchased
the
items
was
based
on
and
not
more
than
the
catalog
price
at
which
the
same
products
were
sold
to
the
public.
we,
both
sides,
exhaustively
discussed
the
legislative
history,
what
is
suggested
by
the
language
of
the
statute
and
what
the
legislative
history
shows.
ther
has
also
been
a
debate
about
whether
the
gao
has
consistently
interpreted
the
statute
since
1951
or
whether,
as
several
courts
and
commentators
have
said,
at
best
it's
interpretation
is
checkered.
i
think
it
is
worthwhile,
though,
to
see
what
the
gao
told
congress
it
thought
the
statute
meant
when
the
amendment
to
the
permanent
procurement
statutes
in
the
fall
of
1951
was
being
considered.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i'll
deal
with
that
right
now.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
should
have
given
you
an
outline
of
where
i
wanted
to
go,
and
i
apologize
for
not
having
done
that.
the
thrust
of
what
i
was
suggesting
a
moment
ago
about
how
the
language
of
the
statute
reads
underlies
what
we
think
is
the
objection
to
the
district
court's
holding.
the
district
court,
as
you
know,
held
in
this
case...
and
we
recognize
that
three
circuits,
at
least...
well,
four
circuits,
including
the
hewlett-packard
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit...
have
held
that
under
this
statutory
authority
the
comptroller
general
can
get
access
to
direct
production
costs,
even
for...
under
a
non-cost-based
contract.
our
view
is
that
the
proper
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
no
cost
records
are
directly
pertinent
to
a
contract
if
the
contract
is
not
cost-based,
either
because
there
were
no
representations
made
about
costs
during
the
negotiation
of
the
price
or
because
the
price
itself
does
not
vary
with
costs.
if
there
is
to
be
a
conclusion...
and
one
cannot
blink
the
fact
that
at
least
four
circuits
have
held
that
some
costs
are
directly
pertinent,
but
they
have
drawn
the
line
at
direct
production
costs...
if
some
costs
are
pertinent,
then
that
seems
to
be,
as
these
four
courts
have
held,
a
reasonable
place
to
draw
the
line.
but
our
submission
this
afternoon
is
that
when
you
look
at
the
terms
of
the
statute,
consider
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
was
to
enable
the
gao
to
see
whether
the
contracting
officers
or
the
government
or
the
sales
agents
for
the
suppliers
had
overstepped
their
bounds
either
by
making
false,
inadvertently
mistaken,
or
inaccurate
predictions
about
cost,
or
whether
the
contracting
officer
from
the
government
standpoint
had
neglected,
as
the
gao
has
found
in
some
instances
is
the
case,
to
ask
for
cost
information
when
that
information
should
have
been
provided,
then
that's
the
situation
in
which
cost
records
may
be
pertinent.
otherwise,
cost
records
are
simply
not
directly
pertinent
and
do
not
involve
transactions
relating
to
the
contract.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
it's...
the
statute
requires
it
to
be
included.
generally
what
happens
is...
and
this
is
shown
by
the
record...
there's
a
lot
of
forms
that
are
issued
in
connection
with
contracts
and
the
contracting
officer
just
checks
a
box.
in
fact,
in
one
or
two
of
the
contracts
this
clause
was
not
physically
included,
but
we're
not
arguing
that
that
has
any
legal
significance.
appropos
of
that
point,
though,
the
three
or
four
circuits
that
have
now
concluded
that
the
gao's
argument
exceeds
the
statutory
language
have
reasoned
that
not
only
is
this
in
excess
of
what
the
statute
provides
but
that
because
this
authority
comes
in
through
a
contract
no
government
contractor
could
reasonably
construe
the
language
to
be
as
broad
as
the
government
now
argues
it
is.
i
think
it's
relevant
also
in
that
connection
to
note
that
before
this
dispute
arose
the
government
had
never,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
sought
to
obtain
indirect
cost
information
in
connection
with
any
non-cost-based
contract.
the
hewlitt-packard
case,
which
until
this
dispute
was
the
high
water
mark
in
this
area,
granted
the
comptroller
general
access
only
to
direct
production
costs,
far
short
of
what
is
being--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--the
position,
justice
o'connor
is
that
this
access
authority
is
designed
to
let
the
gao
check
and
see
whether
the
contractor
and
the
purchasing
agent
on
behalf
of
the
government
did
something
improper
or
negligent
in
the
course
of
negotiating
the
contract.
under
the
procurement
statutes
there
is
an
elaborate
formal
record
that
is
established
about
the
basis
on
which
the
price
being
offered
to
the
government
was
being
based.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
one
ground
for
us
to
win,
justice
white.
but
we
have
never
denied
that
the
government,
through
the
gao,
can
come
in
to
examine
the
representations
that
were
made
to
the
contracting
officer
that
the
price
being
quoted
was
a
catalog
price
and
that
the
price
actually
being
offered
to
the
government
was
below
the
price
at
which
these
items
have
been
sold.
gao
has
conceded
in
interrogatories
and
on
deposition
that
in
fact
the...
these
items
were
priced
on
the
basis
of
catalog
price
lists
or
on
the
basis
of
other
price
competition
and
there
was
no
actual
negotiation.
our
suggested
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
that
in
a
non-cost-based
contract,
the
comptroller
general
has
no
function
beyond
verifying
that.
there
are
examples,
however,
where
he
does
look
at
records--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--we
agree
that
the
gao
would
have
the
right
to
examine
records
that
show
that
the
government
was
getting
the
products
that
it
contracted
for.
to
some
extent,
that
might
include
records
showing
that
what
was
being
produced
was
the
product
involved,
and
so
there
might
be
access
through
that
mechanism,
justice
o'connor
to
direct
production
costs
showing
that
materials
and
packaging
and
the
rest
were
as
represented.
but
the
principal
argument
is
that
costs
are
not
directly
pertinent
to
and
do
not
involve
transactions
relating
to
the
contract
when
it
is
a
category
called
a
non-cost-based
contract.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
negotiated
in
a
technical
sense
only,
justice
white.
the
procurement
law
says
anything
other
than
a
contract
arrived
at
through
simultaneous
sealed
bids
is
negotiated.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
evidence
is
that
there
was
no
negotiation
about
price.
that
is,
the
contracting
agency
says
we
would
like
to
buy
this
product.
what
price
will
you
sell
it
at?
merck
submits
its
price
and
in
all
the
four
instances
that
was
the
price
accepted.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
in
part
what
the--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--oh,
no,
nothing
illegal
about
that
at
all.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there's
nothing
illegal
about
that,
justice
white.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
oh,
the
record
shows
what
merck
would
do
or
has
done.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
if
you
look
at
record
reference
23
attached
to
the
affidavits
of
merck's
general
counsel,
mr.
banse,
are
copies
of
correspondence
with
the
government
on
this
very
point.
various
contracting
officers
said
we'd
like
to
know
what
your
costs
are
for
these
pharmaceuticals.
in
every
case
merck
said
these
are
confidential.
we
will
not
supply
them,
and
finally
colonel
brafogel--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--that's
correct.
colonel
brafogel,
in
fact,
who
is
in
charge
of
all
pharmaceutical
procurement
for
the
defense
department,
wrote
back
and
said
we
recognize
your
industry
position
and
we
will
not
in
the
future
ask
for
cost
information.
that's
record
reference
23.
so
this
matter
was
expressly
thrashed
out
and
the
government
decided
it
would
rather
buy
at
the
price
mr.
staats
said
was
protected
because
it
was
established
in
the
marketplace
rather
than
say
we
won't
buy
unless
you
give
us
your
cost
information.
the
government's
theory,
i
suggest,
has
very
little
relationship
to
the
language
of
the
statute
or
any
of
the
purposes
that
one
could
possibly
glean
from
the
legislative
history.
if
any
records
are
pertinent,
then,
as
several
courts
have
said,
we
can
go
no
further
than
direct
production
costs.
but
the
notion
that
under
this
authority
the
government
is
entitled
to
demand
access
to
what,
from
the
roche
experience
and
the
government's
own
articulation,
might
be
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
cost
records
because
a
contractor
sold
off
the
shelf
a
standard
commercial
item
worth
$10,000,
that
seems
to
have
very
little
connection
with
the
language
of
the
statute
or
its
purpose.
i
would
also
like
to
emphasize
in
my
conclusion
that
despite
the
predictions
that
the
heavens
will
fall
unless
the
various
circuits
are
repudiated
on
this
subject,
this
case
is
truly
unprecedented.
the
government,
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
has
never
obtained
access
to
indirect
cost
records
in
connection
with
a
cost...
non-cost-based
product.
hewlitt-packard
only
allowed
access
to
direct
production
costs.
the
amicus
brief
of
the
aerospace
industries
association,
whose
members
have
$60
billion
a
year
in
government
contracts,
have
said
that
in
their
experience
the
comptroller
general
has
never
tried
to
get
access
to
cost
records
under
non-cost-based
contracts.
in
this
record,
gao
first
said
it
used
its
access
authority
to
audit
$800
million
in
contracts
in
1974
and
'75.
when
we
asked
were
any
of
these
non-cost-based
contracts,
the
answer
came
back,
somewhat
sheepishly,
well,
no,
they
were
all
cost-based.
so
either
accepting
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
or
merck's
somewhat
broader
position
would
have
no
impact
on
the
use
of
this
statute
as
the
gao
has
actually
asserted
it
over
the
past
30
years.
the
same
conclusion
applies
to
the
argument
that
this
power
can
be
used
to
conduct
economic
studies
of
industries
in
order
to
see
how
the
procurement
process
is
working.
when
we
asked
have
you
ever
used
this
power
for
that
purpose,
back
came
the
answer,
yes,
on
five
occasions.
but,
as
the
record
shows,
when
you
look
at
each
of
those,
they
turned
out
to
be
individual
contract
audits
of
cost-based
contracts
or,
in
one
instance,
what
the
government
refers
to
as
the
hy-80
steel
plate
industry.
the
government
was
simply
auditing
a
decision
by
the
navy
department
to
accept
a
contractor's
representation
that
steel
plates
for
nuclear
submarines
were
commercial
products.
there
was
no
cost
audit
involved.
the
navy
was
properly
chastised
for
having
been
gulled
into
thinking
that
nuclear
submarine
plates
were
consumer
items.
that's
the
limit
to
which
the
comptroller
general
has
attempted
to
push
this
power
in
the
last
31
years.
we
think
that's
the
most
eloquent
demonstration
that
this
case
is
a
regrettable
sport
because,
as
the
third
circuit
said,
after
several
years
of
trying
to
hold
the
line
against
senator
nelson,
the
comptroller
general
concluded
he
had
no
viable
alternative
but
to
push
ahead.
we
ask,
therefore,
that
the
judgment
either
be
affirmed
or
that
summary
judgment
be
granted
for
merck.
thank
you.
