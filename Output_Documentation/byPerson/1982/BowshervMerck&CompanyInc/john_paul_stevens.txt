justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
what
the
basis
of
the
nine
percent
figure
is?
justice
stevens
was
he
dealing
with
the
prices
the
government
pays
or
with
retail
prices?
justice
stevens
how
did
he
get
these
cost
figures?
justice
stevens
well,
you
don't
really
know
they're
right,
then,
do
you?
you
don't
know
the
nine
percent--
justice
stevens
--so
we
really
shouldn't
rely
on
the
nine
percent
figure,
should
we?
justice
stevens
but
would
your
case
be
any
different
if
it
were
90
percent
instead
of
nine
percent?
how
does
that
affect
the
legal
issue
before
us?
justice
stevens
your
purpose
is
strictly
to
improve
your
procurement
methods?
justice
stevens
well,
that
puzzles
me,
because
it
would
seem
to
me
that
comparable
sales
to
private
customers
might
be
the
most
relevant
to
the
determination
of
whether
the
government's
getting
a
fair
deal.
justice
stevens
well,
then
you
are
not
interested
in
any
records
pertaining
to
prices
that
are
below
a
fair
market
price
established
by
a
catalog
or
something
like
that.
justice
stevens
well,
either
it
does
or
it
doesn't.
if
we
assume
for
a
moment
it
does
not
provide
any
assurance,
then
i
should
think
the
records
you
would
want
would
be
the
records
of
sales
of
the
company
to
other
private
customers
who
buy
more
or
less
as
you
do.
it
would
be
the
most
relevant,
i
think.
justice
stevens
but
you
disclaim
any
interest
in
those
records,
as
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
stevens
do
you
or
do
you
not
want
to
see
records
pertaining
to
sales
by
the
drug
company
to
other
customers?
justice
stevens
so
there
is
really
no
limit
on
your
demand,
then,
in
terms
of
kinds
of
records
that
you
are
seeking.
justice
stevens
you're
not
satisfied
with
that.
you're
not
satisfied
with
that,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
what
authority
do
you
have
to
touch
it
anyway?
your
authority
is
just
to
stop
buying
from
these
people,
isn't
it?
you
say
you're
not
going
to
touch
the
way
they...
what
authority
do
you
have
to
do
anything
except
say
we
won't
buy
anything
from
you
any
more?
justice
stevens
right.
i
mean,
you
said
you're
not
going
to
touch
the
way
they
do
business.
i
don't
see
how
you've
got
any--
justice
stevens
--couldn't
you
do
that
anyway?
couldn't
you
say
we
won't
buy
from
you
unless
you
show
us
your
records?
justice
stevens
and
you've
had
several
years
to
think
up
that
one.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one...
one
legal
question?
at
the
end
of
judge
mikva's
opinion
below
he
has
this
sentence:
"one
must
come
to
statutes
such
as
this
with
a
pro-disclosure
bias.
"
do
you
think
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
law?
i
notice
you
didn't
cite
that
sentence
in
your
brief.
justice
stevens
just
if
you
make
an
impartial
approach
to
it,
maybe
you
don't
win.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
stevens
he
says
he
must
come
to
it
with
a
pro-disclosure
bias.
that
seemed
to
me
he
regards
that
as
kind
of
part
of
his
legal
analysis,
but
you
don't
subscribe
to
that.
justice
stevens
of
course,
if
that's
the
fact,
why
didn't
you
give
them
the
profit
margins?
justice
stevens
if
that's
the
fact,
what's
the
big
secret?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
their
request
is
very
broad.
supposing
you
had
for
internal
management
purposes
set
a
figure
that
said
what
your
costs
are
on
every
product
you
sell.
a
lot
of
companies
do.
i
don't
know
whether
you
do
or
not.
and
they
just
said
we
want
to
know
what,
for
internal
management
purposes,
you
treat
the
cost
of
these
four
items
as.
that's
all
we
want
to
know.
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
tell
them
that
either,
would
you?
justice
stevens
does
that
mean
that
your
underlying
interest
is
not
so
much
in
keeping
the
information
from
gao
as
the
danger
that
it
might
become...
fall
into
the
public
domain?
justice
stevens
is
it
not
true
that
even
in
the
kind
of
contract
we
have
here
you
do
have
the
clause
in
your
contract,
though,
so
we're
not
necessarily
confined
to
knowing
what
the
statute
means
or
even
if
it
was
just
intended
to
apply
primarily
to
other
contracts.
you
did
agree
to
this
provision
in
these
contracts.
