justice
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question
since
you're
speaking
of
recommendations
that
might
be
made?
suppose
the
government
is
considering
buying
a
drug
product
that
is
marketed
by
two
companies
and
one
of
the
companies
spends
ten
percent
on
research
and
development
and
five
percent
of
that
is
on
pure
research
and
development,
trying
to
reach
out
ten,
twenty
years
from
now
to
find
a
cure
for
cancer,
for
example,
and
the
other
company
spends
only
two
percent
on
total
research
and
development.
obviously,
the
latter's
costs
are
going
to
be
somewhat
less.
the
government,
would
it
feel
compelled
to
buy
only
from
the
company
that
did
two
percent
research
and
development,
foreclosing
or
penalizing
a
company
that
spent
enormous
percentage,
comparatively,
on
research
that
might
be
of
enormous
benefit
to
the
government
as
well
as
other
people?
justice
jr.
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
after
you
find
out?
