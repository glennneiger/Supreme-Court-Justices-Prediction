suppose
they
sell
an
item
for
$2
to
the
government
and
they
advertise
merck
as
a
great
druggist
and
mention
no
product.
how
much
of
that
would
be
allotted
to
the
product?
justice
marshall
maybe.
you
just
don't
know
where
you
are,
do
you?
justice
marshall
you
just
don't
know
where
you
are,
do
you,
when
you
get
into
the
advertising
business?
justice
marshall
well,
how
do
the
people
collect
so
much
up
on
madison
avenue
if
you
know
too?
justice
marshall
there
are
certain
fields
it
seems
that
are
very
impossible
of
delineation
and
i
think
advertising
is
a
great
one.
justice
marshall
you
have
a
man
who's
in
a
moving
picture
and
he
picks
up
a
bottle
of
coca
cola.
that's
advertising
and
they
pay
for
it.
justice
marshall
if
coca
cola
were
selling
you
products,
you
would
look
into
that?
justice
marshall
if
you
give
me
two,
i
can
give
you
22.
i
mean,
we
all
know
about
them.
i
just
don't
understand
what
precise--
justice
marshall
--right.
justice
marshall
you
also
have
to
find
out
how
many
products
he
sells.
justice
marshall
and
how
much
he
gets
for
them.
justice
marshall
well,
how
else
could
you
know?
well,
if
you
aren't
interested
in
how
much
he
gets
for
them,
then
you
have
no
interest
at
all.
you
are
interested
in
how
much
you
pay
for
it.
justice
marshall
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
marshall
you
and
i
are
in
agreement?
justice
marshall
you
want
to
bet?
justice
marshall
what
about
those
that
you
don't
have
a
court
order?
justice
marshall
well,
how
about
all
of
the
cases
that
haven't
been
litigated?
is
there
any
confidentiality
order
on
those?
justice
marshall
well,
are
there
any
that
weren't
litigated?
justice
marshall
well,
that
doesn't
have
a...
in
other
words,
the
only
way
you
get
the
confidentiality
order
is
to
go
to
court?
justice
marshall
well,
how
else?
justice
marshall
and
if
they
say
no,
what
happens?
justice
marshall
i
just
don't
see
how
the
court
ordered
confidentiality
protects
the
statute
in
this
case,
which
doesn't
mention
court.
it
just
says
you
have
a
right
to
go
in
there
and
do
it
without
a
court
order,
don't
you?
justice
marshall
that's
what's
before
us,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
which
statute
has
no
confidentiality
provision
in
it
at
all.
