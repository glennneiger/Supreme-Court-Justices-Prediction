chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
bowsher,
comptroller
against
merck
and
company.
mr.
ganzfried,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
well,
is
the
mission
of
the
comptroller
general
to
inquire
into
contracts
with
the
government
or
in
terms
of
the
pricing,
or
is
part
of
his
mission
to
see
whether
on
the
open
market
the
drug
companies
are
charging
more
than
they
should?
chief
justice
burger
but
the
inquiry
would
appear,
in
many
respects,
to
go
way
beyond
that.
chief
justice
burger
you
are
running
a
little
fast
for
me.
you
are
saying
advertising,
which
can
easily...
easily...
be
allocated.
a
great
many--
chief
justice
burger
--oh,
a
great
many
companies
just
advertise
the
company.
chief
justice
burger
television
and
newspapers
and
magazines
constantly
have
exxon
or
weyerhaeuser...
no
particular
product...
and
these
are
all
conglomerates
now.
now
how
would
you
allocate
that?
chief
justice
burger
well,
that's
not...
your
answer
now
is
different
from
your
previous
statement.
chief
justice
burger
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
government
does
not
make
any
claim
that
merck
is
guilty
of
any
impropriety
in
any
of
the
contracting?
chief
justice
burger
and--
chief
justice
burger
--you
concede
that
there
is
no
suggestion
of
unreasonableness
about
the
contracts?
chief
justice
burger
both.
chief
justice
burger
this
is
not
like
a
case
where
the
government,
as
it
does
sometimes,
suspects
bid-rigging
in
competitive
bidding
and
wants
to
inquire.
no
one
would
question
that.
this
is
just
a
broad-scale
inquiry
in
how
do
you
handle
your
pricing.
now,
as
justice
stevens
suggested,
isn't
there
a
simpler,
cheaper,
quicker
way
to
just
simply
say
companies
that
don't
give
us
this
information
are
on
the
black
list
or
they
are
off
the
negotiable
contract
list?
chief
justice
burger
there
are
cases.
i
wrote
one
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
was
to
the
effect
that
you
can't
blacklist
them
without
a
reason.
but
if
you
said
a
condition
of
being
eligible
for
negotiated
contracts
was
that
you
open
your
books
on
prices,
that
would
be
quite
a
different
matter.
chief
justice
burger
would
you
concede
that
there
are
some
industries,
including
those
dealing
with
the
government,
who
don't
want
anyone
to
know
how
much
they
are
spending
on
pure
research,
that
that
in
itself
is
a
trade
secret?
chief
justice
burger
on
the
contrary,
it
would
occur
to
me
that,
as
justice
powell
has
just
suggested,
the
pharmaceutical
people
would
probably
be
doing
more
pure
research
than
detroit
with
automobiles
and
other
companies.
chief
justice
burger
well,
if
you
take
those
examples,
might
those
facts
not
be
matters
that
the
company
legitimately
would
not
want
anyone
to
know
about,
just
as
during
the
early
part
of
world
war
i
we
were
spending
billions
of
dollars
in
atomic
research,
and
if
it
had
been
known
how
much
was
being
spent
that
might
have
been
an
important
factor
to
other
countries?
now
in
competitors,
is
it
not
a
legitimate
trade
secret
to
keep
secret
how
much
you're
spending
on
pure
research?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lacovara?
chief
justice
burger
if
the
inquiry
were
directed
at
a
search
of
all
the
cost-plus
contracts
that
merck
had,
would
you
have
any
problem?
chief
justice
burger
that
would
be
part
of
the
audit
function,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
bowsher
against
merck
&
company
and
the
consolidated
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
o'connor.
