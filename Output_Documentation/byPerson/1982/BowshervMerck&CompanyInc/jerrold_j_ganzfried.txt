mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
concerns
the
role
of
the
comptroller
general
in
government
procurement,
specifically
his
statutory
right
to
access
to
records
of
government
contractors...
books
and
records.
to
put
the
access
provisions
in
context,
it
must
be
recalled
that
when
congress
created
the
gao
in
1921,
it
directed
that
the
comptroller
investigate
all
matters
relating
to
the
receipt,
disbursement
and
application
of
public
funds,
and
further
directed
the
comptroller
to
make
recommendations
to
congress
looking
for
greater
economy
or
efficiency
in
public
expenditures.
under
that
mandate,
the
comptroller
has,
for
sixty
years,
examined
the
fiscal
responsibility
and
the
manner
in
which
federal
agencies
have
discharged
their
fiscal
responsibilities,
with
an
eye
towards
increasing
efficiency
and
promoting
economy
in
the
expenditure
of
public
funds.
there
should
be
no
doubt
that
this
is
precisely
the
function
congress
assigned
to
the
gao
when
it
included
the
word
1921
act.
congressman
lutes,
who
proposed
that
addition,
stated
that
its
purpose
is
to
make
sure
that
the
comptroller
general
shall
concern
himself
not
simply
with
taking
in
and
paying
out
of
money
from
an
accountant's
point
of
view,
but
that
he
shall
also
concern
himself
with
the
question
as
to
whether
it
is
economically
and
efficiently
applied.
now
following
world
war
ii,
congress
recognized
the
explosive
growth
in
purchases
from
the
private
sector
required
that
the
comptroller
be
given
additional
powers
so
he
could
discharge
these
responsibilities
properly.
for
this
reason,
congress
passed
the
access
to
records
statutes
at
issue
in
this
case.
they
gave
the
comptroller
access
to
records
of
government
contractors
so
that
he
would
have
the
necessary
tool
to
examine
the
transactions
from
both
sides.
this
was
based
on
congress'
determination
that
only
with
this
full
information
could
gao
discharge
its
duties
in
a
meaningful
way.
and
congress
focused
special
concern
on
negotiated
contracts...
those
that
were
made
without
advertised
solicitation
of
bids.
because
negotiated
contracts
lack
the
inherent
safeguards
of
advertised
contracts,
they
are
more
susceptible
to
abuse
and
more
likely
to
result
in
waste
and
extravagance.
in
a
word,
they
pose
a
greater
risk
that
the
government
will
pay
unreasonably
high
prices,
and
for
that
reason
congress
determined
that
negotiated
contracts
require
close
supervision
and
control.
in
fact,
negotiated
contracts
were
prohibited
by
law
until
world
war
ii.
in
this
case,
gao
seeks
to
exercise
its
statutory
right
of
access
to
merck's
records
relating
to
only
four
of
the
many
negotiated
contracts
merck
has
with
the
government.
the
objective
is
to
determine
whether
the
procurement
methods
employed
adequately
protect
the
government's
interest
or
whether
more
economical
measures
could
be
recommended.
to
put
the
importance
of
this
effort
in
perspective,
we
mention
in
our
brief
that
in
1973
government
expenses
for
prescription
drugs
totaled
$1.6
billion,
including
$252
million
in
direct
purchases.
in
congressional
hearings
in
1981,
it
was
estimated
the
total
federal
procurement,
its
aggregate,
on
pharmaceuticals
had
blossomed
to
$2.5
billion,
or...
that
is,
$2.5
billion
per
year,
or
some
25
percent
of
total
industry
sales.
so
where
you
are
dealing
in
the
aggregate,
with
a
major
aspect
of
federal
spending,
where
waste,
if
there
is
any,
would
be
a
serious
drain
on
resources.
but
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
cripples
gao's
ability
to
make
a
meaningful
examination
of
procurement
practices
by
limiting
access
to
records
of
an
estimated
nine
percent
of
merck's
costs.
the
court
has
prevented
gao
from
obtaining
the
bulk
of
the
information
it
needs--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--that's
the
estimate
in
the
article,
i
believe,
by
professor
reike.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
he
was
dealing
with...
that
nine
percent
figure
is
not
nine
percent
of
a
price.
it's
nine
percent
of
total
costs
of
the
manufacturer.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
wish
i
knew.
i
don't
know.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
don't
know
that
it's
nine
percent.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
custom...
the
company
has
not
indicated
that
it's
anything
higher
than
nine
percent.
that
is
the
figure
on
which
this
is...
these
cases
have
been
proceeding,
but
it
is
an
estimate.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
affects
the
legal
issue
in
the
sense
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
has...
assuming
it
is
nine
percent
or
something
close
to
it...
prevents
gao
from
getting
the
vast
majority
of
documents
that
it
needs
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
procurement
methods
involved
in
this
case
were
the
most
appropriate
ones.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
our
purpose.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no,
it
didn't.
but
it
did
grant
a
broad
authorization
for
access
to
records.
it
does
have
certain
express
limitations,
all
of
which
we
complied
with
here.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
not
to
everything.
the
fact
that
the
company
does
not
allocate
costs
of
particular
products
does
make...
does
present
this
case
with
a
certain
accounting
problem,
but
that's
not
necessarily
the
legal
problem
that
we
have.
i
think
we
agree
with
the
other
side
that
had
there
been
a
full
allocation
of
costs
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
get
everything,
but
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
impression
that
we
have
a
claim
to
unlimited
access
to
every
sort
of
record
that
this
company
has,
specifically.
we
are
not
interested
in
records
of
non-government
work.
we
are
interested
only
in
cost
records.
we
have
no
interest
in
strategic
planning
or
general
budgetary
information.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
the
fact
that
they
co-mingle
the
funds--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--no,
not
at
all.
we
certainly
don't
intend
to
suggest
that
there
is
anything
wrongful
in
the
commingling
simply
to
recognize
that
what
we
are
dealing
here
with
is
essentially
for
this
company's
costs,
as
it
has
been
described
to
us...
a
large
pool
of
unallocated
costs,
so
that
even
if
we
were
to
go
in
under
this
court
of
appeals
decision
and
look
at
what
we
estimate
to
be
some
nine
percent
of
their
costs,
we
are
going
to
be
left
with
a
vast
majority
of
the
information
that
it
would
be
helpful
to
know
whether
we
should
change
our
procurement
methods
is
not
going
to
be
available
to
us.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
don't
want
the
records
of
their
sales
to
the
public
other
than
to
determine
that
there
have
been
substantial
sales
to
the
general
public,
to
answer
that
specific
question.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
under
the
statutes
there
is
the
built-in
assumption
that
a
contract
that...
something
that
is
sold
at
a
catalog
price
item
and
is
sold
in
substantial
quantity
to
the
general
public
has
a
built-in,
oh,
built-in
mechanism
for
assuming
that
there
has
been
competition.
because
it's
sold
to
the
public,
you
assume
that
there
has
been
competition,
if
the
government
pays
no
higher
than--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
the
point
i
was
getting
to
is
that
it
may
be,
in
this
industry,
where
they
suggest
that
they
pay
no
attention
to
their
costs
when
they
set
their
prices...
a
contention
which
i
suggest
is
belied
by
their
answers
to
interrogatories...
it
may
be
that
in
this
industry
the
fact
that
something
is
sold
at
a
catalog
price
and
is
sold
in
substantial
quantities
to
the
public
provides
no
real
assurance
that
there
has
been
competition.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
it
might
be
the
sort
of
thing
that
accountants
do,
where
you
need
only
some
relatively
small
sampling
to
be
able
to
determine--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
to
the
extent
that
they
are
records
that
could
verify
the
records
that
we
do
want,
we
might
have
some
interest
in
sampling
of
them.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
would
want
to
see
some
of
that.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
there
are...
let
me
suggest
that
as
i
understand
merck's
position
at
this
point,
they
would
be
willing
to
give
us
information
of
sales
to
other
customers
at
the
same
prices
in
order
to
substantiate
the
fact
that
they
have
in
fact
made
sales
of
substantial
quantities
to
the
general
public.
so
i
don't
think
that
sets
a
limit
on
either
position.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no,
because
those
aren't
cost
records.
what
we're
really
interested
in
is
cost
records.
now
we
should
keep
in
mind--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
since
everything
that
they
do
in
research
and
development,
so
far
as
we
know,
is
unallocated,
yes,
it
would
address
that.
i
can
give
you--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it
would
take
it
in.
now,
to
be
sure,
we
don't
want
to
look
at
all
of
their
experiments
and
know
what
their
scientific
formulas
are,
to
go
in
and
say
we
think
you
should
be
conducting
research
in
this
area
and
not
in
that
area.
on
the
other
hand,
we
do
want
to
know,
in
establishing
costs
for
particular
products,
whether
most
of
their
research
is
in
the
pharmaceutical
area
at
all,
or
whether
it's
in
the
veterinary
medicine
area,
or
in
the
category
that
they,
for
their
internal
allocations,
call
"other".
so
we
would
want
to
have
that
kind
of
breakdown.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
comptroller
general's
interest
is
in
the
price
that
the
government
pays,
and
whether
the
procurement
methods
that
are
used
by
the
government
are
appropriate.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
may
be
that
information
is
obtained
that
has
implications
beyond
that,
but
the
comptroller
general's
purpose
and
his
objective
in
undertaking
the
study
is
to
provide
a
check
on
the
procurement
methods,
to
determine
whether,
for
example,
negotiated,
fixed-price
contracts
really
are
the
most
suitable
way
to
purchase
pharmaceuticals,
or
whether,
in
this
industry
where,
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
the
costs
bear
no
relation
to
the
prices
that
are
charged,
we
might
be
better
off
going
to
a
cost-plus
system
for
buying
pharmaceuticals.
it
may
be
that
the
assumption
that
we
have
that
because
this
is
a
catalog
price
item,
that
there
need
not
be
any
cost
and
pricing
data
submitted
to
the
government
at
the
time
of
negotiation.
but
that's
an
assumption
that
might
have
to
be
rethought
in
this
industry.
so
these
are
the
kind
of
recommendations
that
might
come
out
of
the
study.
i
mean,
it
may
be
that
we
conduct
the
study
and
we
find
that
this
system
is
just
great
and
we
wouldn't
want
to
touch
it
at
all
and
would
recommend
that
it
remain
in
place
exactly
as
it
is.
but
the
point
is,
we
cannot--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--the
only
authority
that
the
comptroller
general
has
is
to
make
recommendations
to
the
procuring
agencies
and
to
congress.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
they...
well,
for
example,
if
they
want
to
charge
the
prices
that
they
charge
and
we
feel
that
it's
not
a
price
that
we
ought
to
pay,
there's
not
going
to
be
a
deal.
if
they
want
to
continue
to
maintain
their
books
of
accounts
on
an
unallocated
basis,
they
can
continue
to
do
that.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that
might
be
one
of
the
recommendations
that
would
come
out
of
this.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
unfortunately,
we
have
had
all
too
many
years
in
this
case
before
we
have
gotten
any
information.
but
i
think
what
i'd
like
to
focus
in
on
are
the
particular
aspects
of
the
cost
items
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
barred
us
from
getting,
and
those
are,
briefly,
advertising,
which
you
would
think
would
be
easily
allocated,
general
administration,
distribution
and
research
and
development,
and
since
these--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--you
would
think
that
the
company
would
know
what
it's
spending,
what
products
it's
spending
its
advertising
on.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
fine.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
accountants
can
certainly
do
it.
first
of
all,
you
take
out
of
that
group
the
advertising
that
is
product-specific,
and
certainly
you
could
apply
it
to
particular
products.
and
then,
once
you
are
left
with
the
bulk
that
you
would
call
this
corporate
name
or
image
advertising...
if
i
can
call
it
that--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--then,
you
see,
you'd
be
able
to
allocate
it.
well,
i
don't
know
how
merck's
advertising
breaks
down,
whether
it
is
product-specific
or
whether
it
is
the
corporate
name
and
the
image
that
is
being
projected.
but
that
is
something
we
would
want
to
find
out.
now
i
think
one
of
the
unfortunate--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
the
interest
in
advertising
is
only
a
halfway
measure
to
getting
a
notion
of
what
their
total
costs
are
for
their
products.
if
we
find
out,
for
example,
that
on
a
per-thousand-pill
basis
the
products
involved
in
this
case
cost
the
government
from
a
range
of
$21
for
diuril
to
$49
to
$50
for
aldomet,
if
we
were
to
find
out,
for
example,
that
the
company's
costs
for
aldomet
are
$2
per
thousand
and
they
are
charging
us
$50,
well,
that
may
well
be
an
area
where
the
comptroller
general
would
want
to
make
recommendations
either
to
the
procuring
agencies
and,
possibly,
to
congress
as
well
for
changes
in
the
procurement
system.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
the
accountants
would
have
to
decide.
it
may
be
that
you
look
at
how
many
products
would
be
covered
when
you
say
they
are
advertising
their--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--excuse
me?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
oh,
sure
we
do.
there
are
certainly
ways
that
accountants
can
allocate--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--but
the
accountants
certainly
have
a
way
to
do
it.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
and
it's
coca
cola,
and
you
know
what
the
product
is.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
the
point
is
that
accountants
can
make
these
kind
of
delineations,
and
let
me
give
you
two
examples.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
it's
the
corporate
name
that's
being
advertised,
that
merck
is
a
great
company--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--and
you
can
break
that
down
on
the
basis
of
how
many
products
merck
has.
you
can
allocate--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--that's
right.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
wouldn't
have
to
know
how
much
he
gets
for
them.
we
would
only
have
to
know
how
much
he
pays
for
the
advertising.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
are
interested
in
what
he
gets
for
the
products
that
he
is
selling
to
the
government.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's...
then
we
are
in
agreement.
then
we're
in
agreement.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
on
that
point.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
at
least
we
both,
i
hope,
understood
that
we
were
talking
about
the
same
point.
that
is
the
agreement
that
i
was
referring
to.
let
me
refer
the
court
to
an
antitrust
case
between
smith-kline
and
eli
lilly
that's
reported
at
427
federal
supplement,
and
at
pages
1107
and
1108
of
that
opinion,
judge
higginbotham
and
the
parties
had
no
difficulty
in
determining,
for
individual
products
in
the
pharmaceutical
industry,
their
promotional
expenses,
research
costs,
costs
of
goods,
profit
margins,
and
pre-tax
return
on
sales.
the
fact
is
that
in
this
industry
allocations
can
be
made.
another
example
comes
from
the
pfizer
case
that
was
before
this
court
in
1972
and
decided
in
404
u.s.
pfizer's
brief
in
that
court...
in
that
case...
at
page
71
recites
the
fact
that
during
the
grand
jury
investigation
which
led
to
the
present
indictment
each
defendant
supplied
to
the
government
cost
studies
prepared
on
principles
determined
by
independent
public
accountants
which
showed
total
costs
for
each
dosage
form
of
each
of
the
drugs
involved,
and
that
from
these
studies
actual
profitability
of
each
item
could
be
ascertained.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
they
weren't
told
to
do
it.
they
had
an
interest
in
doing
it
and
they
did
it.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
absolutely
not.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
exactly
right.
just
as
we
don't
tell
them
that
they
should
take
accelerated
depreciation
for
tax
purposes
but
straight
line
depreciation
in
their
reported
financial
statements.
the
point
is
that
you
can
have...
that
accounting
that
is
done
for
one
purpose
doesn't
have
to
be
carried
over
for
all
other
purposes.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
correct.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
or
is
that
necessary
for
us
to
get
access.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
as
to
the
methods
of
the
contract
or
the
prices
of
the
contract?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
as
to
the
methods,
they
followed
the
methods
and
procedures
that
were
in
place
and
should
have
been
used.
as
to
the
prices,
that's
one
of
the
reasons
we'd
like
to
conduct
the
study.
we
have
not
prejudged
anything.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
i
understand
that
there
are
some
cases
that
suggest
that
the
government
would
not
be
in
a
position
simply
to
blacklist
companies.
but
we
don't
know
whether
it
would
even
be
a
good
idea
at
this
point.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
that
may
be
one
of
the
recommendations
that
comes
out
of
the
study.
there
are,
in
the
truth
in
negotiation
act,
which
was
passed
after
a
proposal
by
the
comptroller
general,
that
did
require
submission
of
cost
and
pricing
information
in
certain
circumstances.
whether
that
is
going
to
come
out
of
this
study,
we
don't
know.
that's
precisely
why
we're
here.
we
need
the
information
before
we
know
what
recommendations
we're
going
to
make.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
government's
purpose
is
not
to
tell
companies
that
they
are
spending
too
much
or
too
little
on
research
or
to
penalize
companies
for
spending
too
much
or
too
little
on
research.
what
we're
trying
to
find
out
is
just
what
it
costs
the
companies
to
make
the
products
that
we're
paying
for.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
anything
from
saying
that
the
system
works
fine
to
saying
that
there
are
significant
changes
that
ought
to
be
made.
but
until
we
have
the
information
which
we
are
entitled
to
have,
we
don't
know
what
those
recommendations
are
going
to
be.
i
hope
i
have
suggested
to
you
some
of
the
range
of
possibilities,
but
i
do
want
to
make
clear
that
nothing
has
been
prejudged
and
that
we
need
the
information
before
any
of
those
judgments
can
be
made.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
there
may
be
some
industries
in
which
that's
the
case.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
at
the
moment
and
i
certainly
don't
believe
that
the
pharmaceutical
industry
would
be
one
of
them.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
they
may.
but
they
certainly
have
not
kept
any
great
secret
about
how
much
they
spend
on
it.
they
certainly
may
keep
secret
what
they
are
working
on
and
we're
not
interested
in
the
scientific
formulas.
we're
not
going
in
to
find
out
are
you
working
on
cardiovascular
drugs
or
are
you
working
on
analgesic
drugs.
that's
not
the--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--we're
not
talking
about...
we're
not
talking
about
disclosure
of
any
information
to
competitors.
there
is
a
confidentiality
order
in
this
case.
the
government
will
abide
by
it
in
fact.
despite
the
suggestion
to
the
contrary
in
merck's
reply
brief,
the
government
proposed
the
confidentiality
order
and
as
early
as
its
interrogatory
answers
in
september
of
1976
acknowledged
its
willingness
to
provide
confidentiality
to
the
company,
just
as
we
proposed
a
consent
to
such
orders
in
all
the
other
cases
involving
pharmaceutical
companies.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
and
the
court.
it's
a
court
order.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
all
of
the
cases
that
have
been
litigated
in
the
pharmaceutical--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--in
this
particular
set
of
requests
there
was
only
one
that
was
not
litigated
and
i
don't
know
what
the
status
of--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--there
was
one
that
was
not
litigated.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
not
necessarily.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
may
be
that
it
could
be
negotiated
at
the
time
that
the
request
is
issued.
that
would
be
one
possibility.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
they
say
no,
then
you've
got
to
go
to
court
in
order
to
get
the
records.
of
course,
as
of
1980
we
have
an
additional
remedy,
and
that
is
that
we
can
issue
subpoenas
under
the
amendments
to
the
general
accounting
office
act
of
1980.
we
can
get
subpoenas.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
correct.
when
the
company--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--is
the
statute
that
says
that
the
contracts
are
to
provide
that
the
comptroller
general
has
the
right
to
go
in.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that
statute
does
not.
there
are
other
statutes,
the
citations
of
which
i
can
find...
i
don't
have
them
offhand...
that
do
afford
some
protections
for
companies
as
to
trade
secrets
that
might
be
disclosed.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
under...
i
believe
that's
right.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
he
has
not.
the
scope
of
access
under
the
subpoena
power
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
scope
of
access
under
the
provisions
that
are
at
issue
here.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
gives
us
an
additional
remedy.
the
hope
in
congress
was
that
it
would
speed
up
the
process.
in
fact,
the
pharmaceutical
cases
that...
this
case
and
the
bristol
case
which
was
before
this
court
18
months
ago...
were
specific
examples
that
were
cited
to
congress
as
providing
the
need
for
having
additional
power
and
congress
did
provide
the
subpoena
power
to
the
comptroller
general.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
i
think
that
given
that
this
statute...
i
think
one
must
come
to
this
statute
with
a
pro-disclosure
bias
or
one
must
certainly
come
to
that
conclusion
after
reading
the
statute
because
it's
a
broad
authorization.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no,
i
think
whether
one
makes
a
partial
or
impartial
approach,
the
only--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
i
think
he
had
already
reached
his...
he
had
provided
his
analysis
before
he
made
that
statement
and
having
come
to
his
conclusion
he
addressed
it
that
way.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
think
it's
certainly
an
appropriate
conclusion
to
come
to
and
it's
a
conclusion
that
we
suggest...
we
submit
that
this
court
should
reach.
thank
you.
