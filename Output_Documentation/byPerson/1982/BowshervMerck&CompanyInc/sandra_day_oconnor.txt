justice
o'connor
mr.
lacovara,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
make
it
difficult
for
the
government
to
know
that
merck's
position
was
correct,
that
the
price
of
the
goods
bore
no
relation
whatever
to
cost
of
production,
without
giving
the
government
access
to
enough
of
the
records
to
check
the
veracity
of
that
proposal
by
merck.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
merck
&
company
entered
into
three
fixed-price
negotiated
contracts
with
governmental
agencies
for
the
sale
of
pharmaceutical
products.
the
contract
prices
were
based
on
merck's
catalog
prices.
as
required
by
statute,
each
contract
contained
a
standard
access-to-records
clause
granting
the
comptroller
general
the
right
to
examine
any
"directly
pertinent"
records
involving
transactions
related
to
the
contract.
relying
on
these
clauses,
the
comptroller
general
demanded
that
merck
permit
access
to
cost
records
pertinent
to
the
contracts,
including
records
of
costs
of
direct
materials,
labor,
and
overhead,
and
support
for
the
prices
charged.
merck
refused
to
comply
and
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
district
court
that
the
comptroller
general's
access
demand
exceeded
his
statutory
authority.
the
district
court
granted
partial
summary
judgment
for
each
party,
permitting
access
to
records
of
direct
costs,
including
manufacturing
and
delivery
costs,
but
barring
access
to
records
of
indirect
costs,
including
research
and
development,
marketing
and
promotion,
distribution,
and
administrative
costs,
except
to
the
extent
that
those
costs
were
included
in
the
direct
costs
items.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
we
also
affirm.
the
legislative
history
of
the
access
to
records
provisions
reveals
two
conflicting
congressional
aims.
on
the
one
hand,
congress
wanted
to
equip
the
general
accounting
office
with
a
tool
to
detect
fraud,
waste,
inefficiency,
and
extravagance
in
government
contracting.
on
the
other
hand,
by
adding
the
words
directly
pertinent
in
the
statute,
congress
also
intended
to
restrict
to
some
degree,
the
comptroller
general's
access
power
in
order
to
prevent
government
snooping
into
contractor's
nongovernmental
business
affairs.
in
this
case,
the
appropriate
balance
between
the
public
interest
served
by
thorough
gao
investigations
and
the
private
interest
in
freedom
from
governmental
intermeddling
in
the
contractor's
private
business
affairs
weighs
in
favor
of
access
to
merck's
direct
cost
records
but
against
access
to
merck's
indirect
cost
records.
the
fact
that
the
records
here
were
sought
for
the
purpose
of
either
conducting
an
economic
study
of
the
pharmaceutical
industry
or
securing
information
desired
by
individual
members
of
congress
does
not
negate
the
general
accounting
office's
authority
to
examine
the
directly
pertinent
records.
