justice
white
saying
this
is
a
biased
conclusion.
justice
white
of
course,
if
you
limit...
if
that's
the
limited
purpose,
you
have
already
won
your
lawsuit,
i
guess.
justice
white
just
the
point
is
simply
that
the
verification
might
take
you
into
some
areas
that
are
more
in
keeping
with
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
order,
wouldn't
it?
justice
white
if
you...
these
are
negotiated
contracts.
justice
white
and
do
they
actually
negotiate?
justice
white
yes.
well,
i
suppose
the
government
would
like
to
know
if
they
couldn't
have
gotten
it
cheaper
and
that
they
might
have
if
the
costs
were
low
enough.
justice
white
would
it
be
legal
for
the
government
to
say,
even
though
it
isn't
a
cost-plus
contract
and
it
isn't
a
bid
contract,
if
they
refuse
to
deal
with
anybody
unless
they
tell
them
their
costs?
justice
white
so
the
government
could
tell
merck,
well,
look,
don't
send
us
any...
when
you
send
us
your
bids,
send
us
your
costs
or
we
won't
deal.
justice
white
what
do
you
think
merck
would
do
then?
justice
white
they
would
say
we'll
sell
it
someplace
else.
justice
white
and
then
the
government
didn't
call
your
bluff.
