justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
where
did
all
this
prong
lingo
come
from?
is
that
in
aguilar
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
aguilar
and
spinelli
intended
to
cover
the
whole
waterfront
insofar
as
probable
cause
and
warrants--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
draper
involved
one
small
inaccuracy
on
the
part
of
the
informer,
too.
wasn't
he
a
day
off
on
the
day
that
draper
would
arrive
in
the
denver
station?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
alternative...
the
informer
give
an
alternative?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
you
were,
say,
a
police
sergeant
or
a
magistrate,
rather
than
an
attorney,
and
this
case
were
presented
to
you
on
its
facts
not
at
the
present
time,
but
supposing
that
another
informant
turns
up
at
a
later
date
and
it
turns
out
to
be
the
same
as
this...
the
same
person
as
wrote
this
anonymous
letter.
would
you
say
that
this
anonymous
letter
gave
reason
for
thinking
that
the
informant
was
a
credible
one,
a
second
time
around?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
can
you
say
that
he
gave
you
previous
credible
information
by
virtue
of
what
he
did
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
really
make
sense?
my
own
personal...
if
this
isn't
probable
cause,
i
never
saw
probable
cause.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
go
back
to
the
terms
of
the
constitution
and
talk
about
reasonable
searches
and
that
sort
of
thing,
no
one
in
their
right
mind
would
conclude
that
this
was
not
a
reasonable
action
on
the
part
of
the
police.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
anytime
you're
going
by
hearsay
you
don't
know
that
the
person
may
not
have
been
motivated
by
a
grudge
in
this
particular
instance.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
simply
rules
out
the
use
of
anonymous
tips,
then.
if
you're
dealing
with
a
police
informer,
a
knowledgeable
police
officer
can
have
his
affidavit
drawn
in
such
a
way
that
to
the
extent
he
truthfully
can
he
puts
forth
the
requirements
set
forth
in
the
cases
of
this
court.
but
when
you're
dealing
with
an
anonymous
tip,
you
can't
say
well,
you
really
ought
to
have
said
a
little
more
on
this
subject.
you
either
act
on
it
or
you
don't.
and
you're
saying,
in
effect,
you
can't
act
on
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
seriously
maintain
that
this
was
consistent
only
with
innocence,
when
you
have
the
quick
flight
to
south
florida
and
the
non-stop
trip
back?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
an
anonymous
tip
more
suspect
than
that
of
a
police
informer
who
is
presumably
maybe
dependent
for
his
living
on
what
he
supplies
to
the
police
in
the
way
of
information?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
a
hypothesis?
it
could
be
with
good
motive,
it
could
be
with
bad
motive;
you
simply
don't
know.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
worse
than
the
case
of
the
police
informant
who
is
basically
being
paid
for
his
information
and
who
presumably
has
to
provide
some
good
information,
may
have
to
provide
some
bad
information,
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
he's
a
police
informant,
he's
not
standing
there
with
the
magistrate.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
over
what
hurdle?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
base
that
on
the
aguilar
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
sum
of
those
cases
is
to
come
out
with
a
kind
of
tomistic
approach
that
some
of
the
lower
courts
have
applied
where
you
have
these
very
complicated
prong
inquiries?
do
you
think
all
that
can
be
spun
out
of
the
simple
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
says
there
shall
be
no
unreasonable
searches?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
that
can
be
spun
out
of
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
makes
you
think
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
assume
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
isn't
a
whole
lot
of
the
law
of
evidence
laid
down
in
the
constitution,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
argue
this
before
the
illinois
courts,
mr.
biebel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if...
if
that's
your
position
i'm
surprised
that
you
answered
justice
steven's
question
the
way
you
did.
if
you're
talking
about
totality
of
the
circumstances,
reasonable
basis,
i
would
think
that
a
far
less
sweeping
change
then
you're
urging
would
simply
be
to
say
that
the
police
may
consider,
after
developing
facts,
that
when...
between
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
the
warrant
and
the
search
or
seizure
that
might
not
have
been
available
to
the
magistrate.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
happened
in
nathanson?
did
the
police
officer
go
to
a
magistrate
and
the
magistrate
turned
him
down?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
lee,
are
there
any
statistics
showing
by
what
percentage
of
times
a
magistrate
turns
down
a
request
for
a
search
warrant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
a
certain,
at
least
partial
irony
in
your
position,
mr.
reilley?
the
law
is
supposed
to
encourage
police
officers
to
go
and
get
a
warrant
rather
than
simply
go
ahead
on
probable
cause
without...
what
they
think
is
probable
cause
without
a
warrant.
and,
yet,
under
the
rule
that
you're
advocating
and
i
think
many
of
the
court's
decisions
undoubtedly
support
you
the...
if
a
police
officer
goes
and
gets
a
warrant
he
has
to
put
in
black
and
white
once
and
for
all
his
view
of
what
facts
amounts
to
a
probable
cause.
and
it's
very
easy
to
simply
review
it
as
the
moment
it
was
presented
to
the
magistrate.
but
if
he
simply
goes
out
on
a
basis
of
probable
cause,
it's
a
much
more
fluid
situation
where
he
can
come
into
court
two
weeks
later
and
testify
what
he
thought
was
probable
cause,
and
perhaps
put
a
better
face
on
the
evidence
that
he
has.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
experience
have
you
ever
known
of
a
magistrate
to
refuse
a
request
for
a
search
warrant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
happen
often
in
illinois?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
remember
what
sort
of
rate
of
acceptance
you
had--
