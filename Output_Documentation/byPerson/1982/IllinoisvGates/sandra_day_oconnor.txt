do
you
think
that
the
draper
provides
an
alternative
approach
to
probable
cause
for
search
warrants?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
didn't
we
also
have
a
license
plate
issued
for
a
different
vehicle?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
isn't
that
something
a
little
out
of
the
ordinary?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
a
detailed
anonymous
tip
which
is
corroborated
and
which...
and
the
details
of
which
could
be
characterized
as
suspicious
would
be
sufficient,
mr.
reilley?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
would
be
adequate,
either.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
self-verifying
details.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
spinelli
is
indicated
as
all
right
for
the
basis
of
knowledge
prong.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
corroboration
of
the
details
would
supply
that,
would
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
was
my
assumption,
and
you
said
that
that
would
not
be
enough
in
your
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
veracity.
and
we
can
have
self-verifying
details
for
the
other
prong,
so
there
we
are.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
reilley,
under
illinois
law,
do
you
happen
to
know
if
the
law
allows
you
to
put
a
license
plate
on
a
car
if
you
are
not...
if
the
license
is
issued
for
car
a,
may
you
put
it
on
car
b?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
on
its
face,
at
least,
that
was
an
illegal
activity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
does
the
record
show
in
this
case
about
the
improper
vehicle
license?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
not
the
exclusionary
rule
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
whose
mistake
are
we
looking
at
here,
the
magistrate's
or
the
police?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
contend
that
the
court,
if
it
reaches
the
question
here
of
the
good
faith
exception,
should
focus
in
on
some
good
faith
exception
of
the
magistrate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
if
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
was,
as
you
suggested
earlier
in
your
remarks,
deterrence
of
improper
police
conduct,
then
how
does
application
of
a
good
faith
exception
to
a
magistrate's
decision
in
issuing
the
warrant
further
the
deterrence
of
the
police?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there
any
inquiry
under
that
aspect
in
the
court
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
determinations
that
are
completely
wrong
and
unsupportable.
now
under
your
view,
it
would
be
perfectly
all
right
for
the
police
officer
to
take
such
a
warrant
and
follow
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
there
is
a
secondary
interest
in
making
sure
the
government
itself
isn't
involved
in
wrongdoing.
