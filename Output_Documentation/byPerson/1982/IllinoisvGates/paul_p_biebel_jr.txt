mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
was
originally
argued
before
this
court
on
october
13,
1982,
and
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
aguilar-spinelli
standard
to
this
case
where
an
anonymous
letter
was
involved.
however,
on
november
29,
1982,
this
case
was
restored
to
the
calendar
for
reargument
to
consider
the
additional
question:
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
as
enunciated
in
mapp
and
weeks
should
to
any
extent
be
modified
so,
for
example,
not
to
require
the
exclusion
of
evidence
obtained
in
the
reasonable
belief
that
the
search
and
seizure
was
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment.
we
are
back
before
the
court
today
to
consider
this
additional
important
issue.
before
i
started
my
argument
i
would
simply
like
to
indicate
that
our
argument
in
a
nut
shell
is
this:
determinations
of
probable
cause
are
practical,
factual
judgments
of
probability.
it
is
the
function
of
the
magistrate
or
the
judge
to
make
decisions
prior
to
a
search.
because
of
the
factual
nature
of
this
determination,
because
of
the
respect
for
the
magistrate's
function
in
this
regard,
and
because
of
society's
interest
in
avoiding
the
exclusionary
rule's
harsh
costs,
these
determinations
should
be
given
great
deference
on
motions
to
suppress.
evidence
should
not
be
excluded
if
any
reasonable
person
could
have
concluded
that
there
was
probable
cause
on
the
basis
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
judged
by
the
practical
and
factual
considerations
of
everyday
life.
in
short,
if
there's
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
finding
of
probable
cause
the
exclusionary
rules
should
not
apply.
any
analysis
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
we
believe,
must
consider
the
context
in
which
the
exclusionary
rule
was
born.
around
the
turn
of
the
century
there
was
a
great
concern
about
flagrant
and
egregious
police
misconduct.
in
cases
like
weeks
in
1914
and
silverthorne
lumber
company
in
1920,
you
had
situations
where
persons
were
arrested
and
while
they
were
in
custody
the
police
went
to
their
homes
or
went
to
their
businesses
and
searched
without
probable
cause
of
any
sort
and
without
warrants.
and
obtained
through
their
appropriated
papers
and
effects
evidence
that
was
used
against
them.
in
rochin
versus
california
in
1952,
this
court's
conscience
was
shocked
when
the
police
took
mr.
rochin
to
the
hospital
and
had
his
stomach
pumped
in
order
to
obtain
the
morphine
capsules
which
he
had
swallowed
after
the
police
had
forced
their
way
into
his
house
without
a
warrant.
and,
finally,
in
mapp
versus
ohio
in
1961
which
reversed
wolf
versus
colorado,
of
course,
and
applied
the
exclusionary
rule
to
the
states,
you
had
a
situation
where
the
police
attempted
to
enter
mrs.
mapp's
house
with
her
consent.
upon
the
advice
of
her
attorney
she
refused
that
consent.
the
police
a
few
hours
later
forced
their
way
into
the
house,
searched
the
entire
premises
and
found
four
pamphlets
and
a
few
photographs,
all
allegedly
pornographic.
each
of
these
cases
which
ultimately
led
up
to
weeks...
lead
up
to
mapp,
involved
flagrant
acts
of
police
misconduct
for
which
this
court
indicated
the
exclusionary
rule
ought
to
apply.
but
the
exclusionary
rule
which
was
meant
to
deter
such
serious
misconduct
by
police
has
come
to
mean
much
more
as
it's
been
applied
by
trial
courts
and
review
in
courts
around
this
country.
the
new
rule...
the
rule
now
applies
to
evidence...
to
exclude
evidence
at
trial
no
matter
what
the
error,
large
or
small,
committed
by
police
and
by
magistrates.
now,
if
the
primary
intent
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
meant
to
deter
police
misconduct...
and
this
court
has
said
that
on
may
occasions
starting
with
elkins
in
1960...
then
the
world
simply
does
not
work
in
a
situation
as
here
where
it's
hard
to
see
what
the
police
did
wrong.
we
argued
in
our
initial
briefs
that
we
didn't
believe
the
aguilar-spinelli
two-prong
test
even
if
applicable
to
our
case
was
violated
because
of
the
extensive
corroboration
of
the
letter
and
because
of
the
determination
of
probable
cause
made
by
judge
lewis
when
he
issued
the
search
warrant.
but
even
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
the
aguilar-spinelli
test
was
violated,
we
would
nevertheless
contend
that
in
this
instance
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
be
applied
because
the
anonymous
letter
coupled
with
ample
corroboration
amounted
to
probable
cause
under
the
definition
as
historically
enunciated
by
this
court.
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
what
was
argued
before
the
illinois
courts
was
the
aguilar-spinelli
standard,
your
honor.
and
we
argued
that
in
that
instance
the
aguilar-spinelli
standard
was
met.
i--
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
--the
exclusionary
rule
is
really
here
for
the
first
time,
your
honor.
it
was
not
mentioned
in
oral
argument
the
first
time
before
this
court.
we
were
focusing
in
on
aguilar-spinelli
but
in
a
sense
we
were
focusing
in
an
indirect
fashion
on
the
consideration
of
probable
cause.
what
we
are
doing
in
our
approach
today
is
looking
at
that
probable
cause
aspect
of
this
case
in
a
closer
way.
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
your
honor,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
established
the
exclusionary
rule
in
1923
in
people
versus
brocamp.
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
yes,
it
was
after
weeks,
before
wolf.
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
long
before
mapp,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
but,
this
court
has
defined
that
rule
in
people
versus
demorrow
in
1974
to
follow
the
standards
enunciated
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
the
analysis
that
was
made
in
this
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
aguilar-spinelli
issue,
took
into
consideration
the
federal
guidelines
that
took
place.
so,
illinois
does
track
the
federal
fourth
amendement
law
with
regard
to
the
exclusionary
rule
and
follow...
has
followed
it
closely.
we
believe
that
that
is
consistent
with
whatever
the
court
would
do
today.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
law
of
search
and
seizure
has
become
complicated
and
confusing.
and
one
of
the
more
confusing
areas
involves
the
application
of
the
aguilar-spinelli
standard.
professor
lafate
has
140
pages
in
his
treatise
on
hearsay
evidence
with
regard
to
this
problem.
because
it
was
confusing
we
have
cases
like
people
versus
bell
where
a
district
court
held
that
the
affidavit
with
regard
to
an
eyewitness
identification
didn't
support
the
credibility
and
reliability
of
that
eyewitness
in
case...
and
consequently
that
evidence
was
suppressed.
the
fifth
circuit
said
that's
simply
wrong,
that
aguilar-spinelli
ought
to
be
limited
to
informant
situations.
in
our
case,
too,
we
have
an
obvious
confusion
with
regard
to
aguilar-spinelli
because
both
the
police
and
the
judge
felt
that
the
letter
could
be
utilized
in
order
to
determine
whether
probable
cause
exists
or
not.
to
hold
in
this
case
that
the
exclusionary
rule
applies
where
the
police
made
a
diligent
and
a
reasonable
effort
to
fulfill
their
responsibilities
is
in
effect
to
place
form
over
substance.
the
essence
and
the
analysis
of
whether
the
search
warrant
should
issue
is
whether
or
not
there's
probable
cause.
all
three
illinois
courts
considering
this
issue
talked
in
terms
of
probable
cause
but
they
analyzed
it
in
light
of
the
two-pronged
aguilar-spinelli
test
which
we
discussed
the
last
time
we
were
before
this
court.
however,
we
suggest
in
this
case
that
this
court
ought
to
consider
stating
affirmatively
that
they're
going
to
return
to
the
unadorned
probable
cause
standard
which
was
enunciated
in
carroll
and
in
brinegar.
in
brinegar,
this
court
stated
that
when
you're
dealing
with
probable
cause
you're
dealing
with
probabilities.
these
are
not
technical
considerations.
they
are
factual
and
practical
concerns
of
everyday
life
in
which
reasonable
and
prudent
men,
and
not
legal
technicians,
act.
put
in
another
light,
this
concept
of
probable
cause
merely
requires
an
objectively
reasonable
assessment
that
it's
more
probable
than
not
that
the
search
warrant
covered
evidence
of
the
crime.
this
basic
probable
cause
standard
is
a
realization
that
police
and
magistrates
deal
in
factual
contexts
in
which
they
simply
don't
have
all
the
answers,
but
nevertheless
may
be
required
to
act
if
they
believe
there's
probable
cause.
mr.
justice
white
put
it
well
in
his
dissent
in
stone
versus
powell
where
he
said,
making
arrests
in
circumstances
in
which
the
police
officer
feels
he
has
probable
cause
is
precisely
what
the
community
expects
of
him.
neither
police
officers
nor
judges
issuing
warrants
need
delay
until
unquestioned
proof
is
accumulated.
the
officer
may
be
shirking
his
duty
if
he
does
so.
that
same
philosophy
has
been
reiterated
in
draper
where
this
court
said
the
police
would
be
derelict
in
their
duty
if
they
didn't
follow
up
on
leads.
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
no,
we
haven't
unhooked
from
draper
at
all.
we
certainly
discussed
draper
at
length
the
last
time,
your
honor.
and
we
feel
that
the
draper
analysis,
which
is
consistent
with
the
carroll-brinegar
analysis
which
takes
into
consideration
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
really
what
we're
talking
about
today
you've
got
to
look
at
the
whole
picture.
we
think
that
draper
amply
supports
our
position
in
this
case
as
to
the
analysis
to
be
used.
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
we
believe
the
probable
cause
determination
is
made
by
the
circumstances
which
were
given
to
the
magistrate,
or
in
our
instance,
the
judge
at
the
time
he
considers
whether
or
not
to
issue
a
warrant.
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
there
was
a
presumption
that
the
car
was
on
its
way
back
to
chicago.
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
didn't
know
it--
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
--but,
in
view
of
the
fact
and
circumstances--
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
--that's
right.
and,
due
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
you
had
at
the
time,
we
believed
that
there
was
enough
evidence
to
indicate.
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
that's
right.
we
believe
that
probable
cause
is
established
on
the
basis
of
what
they
knew
when
the
judge
issued
the
search
warrant.
since
probable
cause
means
only
a
probability
and
not
unquestioned
proof,
and,
since
many
situations
which
confront
police
officers
are
more
or
less
ambiguous,
room
must
be
allowed
for
some
mistakes
on
their
part.
but
the
mistakes
must
be
those
of
reasonable
men
acting
on
facts
which
lead
sensibly
to
conclusions
of
probability
as
this
court
mentioned
in
brinegar--
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
--within
the...
within
the
standard
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
it
could
be
argued
and
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
magistrate
perhaps
in
applying
the
aguilar-spinelli
two-prong
test
made
a
mistake
in
this
conclusion
of
probable
cause.
we
would
contend
that--
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
--we're
saying
that
our
position
is
somewhat
different
than
the
solicitor's
in
this
regard.
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
within
the
context
of
cases
like
this
that
we're
talking
about
which
are
basically
factual
cases.
the
solicitors
is
talking
in
a
broader
scope
which,
of
course,
his
role
as
amicus
would
do.
we're
saying
within
the
factual
circumstances
that
we
have
here,
we
think
that
the
analysis
ought
to
be
back
to
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis.
and
the
review
of
that
should
be
a
reasonable
basis
review.
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
i
think...
i
think
your
point
is
well
taken.
i
think
the
law
as
it
stands
now
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
have
to
be
that
which
leads
up
to
the
issuance
of
the
warrant
but
certainly
if
you
look
at
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
our
case
it
would
certainly
indicate
that
a
round
trip...
a
non-stop
trip
from
florida
occurred
in
those,
you
know,
a
great
deal
found
in
the
car.
so,
facts
and
circumstances
certainly
would
lend
support
to
the
finding
of
probable
cause
that
judge
lewis
made
in
this
case
when
he
issued
the
search
warrants.
we're
saying
that
even
though
there
may
have
been
a
mistake,
that
that
shouldn't
make
any
difference
in
this
case.
if
you
take
the
case
of
people
versus
hill
which
was
cited
by
this
court
in
1971
you
had
exactly
that
situation.
the
police
went
to
mr.
hill's
apartment
and
they
arrested
a
man
that
resembled
hill.
he
said
his
name
was
miller.
he
showed
identification.
the
police
didn't
believe
him.
he
said
he
didn't
know
anything
about
weapons.
there
appeared
to
be
a
gun
in
the
house.
they
arrested
miller
who
they
thought
was
hill,
searched
the
apartment.
it
was
prior
to
schimel,
and,
consequently,
was
a
proper
search.
and,
they
found
evidence
indicative
of
the
guilt
of
hill.
this
court
said
that
even
though
there
had
been
a
mistake
as
to
who
had
been
arrested
there
was
nevertheless
probable
cause
because
the
police
reasonably
believed
that
the
man
arrested
was
hill.
the
court
cited
brinegar's
standard,
and,
said
that
what
we're
looking
at
here
is
a
factual
and
practical
rather
than
a
legal
technical
view...
legally
technical
view,
and,
consequently,
that
mistake
shouldn't
make
any
difference
in
the
finding
of
probable
cause
which
is
actually
the
determination
of
probabilities.
because
this
is
a
practical
consideration,
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
is
entitled
to
great
deference
as
this
court
has
stated
in
cases
such
as
jones
and
ventresca.
and,
consequently,
since
there
is
deference
paid
to
the
court
the
review
of
the
finding
of
probable
cause
is
in
effect
a
review
of
the
finding
of
fact,
and,
therefore,
should
be
reviewed
on
a
reasonable
basis
standard
rather
than
demobile
review
as
you
would
have
with
questions
of
law.
this,
we
would
observe
is
the
same
basic
standard
that
courts
use
in
determining
whether
or
not
probable
cause
exists
on
appeal.
as
this
court--
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
--what
we're
basically
saying,
here,
is
that
in
these
cases
the
deterrence,
yes,
but,
comes
in
this
way,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
that
the
police
activity
in
this
case
was
reasonable.
it
was
thorough.
it
was
done
over
a
short
period
of
time.
that
is
basically
the
deterrence...
i'm
sorry,
the
good
faith
aspect
of
this
case
is
basically
what
the
solicitor
is
putting
forward.
what
we're
saying
is
in
these
types
of
cases
that
what
we've
got
to
look
at
is
the
factual
context
in
which
the
probable
cause
finding
is
made,
and
if
there's
a
reasonable
basis
for
it.
and
many
cases,
i
might
add,
involved
this
exact
question
on
motions
to
suppress,
was
the
evidence
sufficient
to
show
probable
cause.
what
we're
saying
is
that
even
though
we're
asking
the
court
to
mutilate
what
it
said
before,
we
think
the
laws
become
confused
in
this
area.
and
we
think
the
court
ought
to
clearly
establish
what
the
role
of
probable
cause
is
in
search
warrants,
what
the
standard
is,
and
what
the
role
of...
what
the
basis
of
review
ought
to
be.
if
that's
the
case,
then,
a
lot
of
these
aberrant
decisions
which
have
come
down
in
the
search
and
seizure
area
i
think
would
be
changed
if
those
considerations
were
made
in
light
of
the
standard
we're
asking
the
court
to
enunciate
in
this
case.
getting
back.
the
standard
in
criminal
cases
is
not
whether
the
reviewing
court
feels
that
the
defendant
is
proved
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but,
rather
where
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
show
that
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
woodby
versus
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
in
1966.
and,
in
1979,
this
was
reiterated
in
jackson
versus
virginia.
mr.
justice
stewert
issued
the
opinion
in
that
case
in
somewhat
different
language
where
he
said,
the
issue
was
whether
any
rational
trier
of
fact
could
have
determined
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
using
that
basic
philosophy
of
deference
for
the
factfinder,
we
apply
that
to
this
case
involving
probable
cause.
this
court
said,
for
example,
in
jones
versus
united
states
in
1960
that
the
standard
of
review
with
regard
to
probable
cause
is
whether
there
is
a
substantial
basis
to
believe
that
the
narcotics
were
probably
present
in
the
apartment.
now,
by
using
the
substantial
or
reasonable
or
rational
basis
the
focus
becomes
not
what
the
reviewing
judge
thought,
but
what
a
reasonable,
a
rational
police
officer
or
magistrate
could
have
believed
when
he
made
the
determination
of
probable
cause.
and
if
that
determination
is
probable,
it
ought
to
be
respected
by
the
court.
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
that's
right,
police
officers
are
are
on
the
streets.
they
obviously
are
professionals
in
what
they
do
and
that's
different
from
what
we
all
do.
and,
we
think
that
what
they've
learned
in
experience
in
the
street
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
whether
or
not
they
believe
there's
probable
cause
which
exists
in
these
cases.
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
nathanson
needs
reexamination,
your
honor,
because
all
it
was
was
a
conclusory
statement
of
probable
cause.
there
was
not--
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
--by
the
police
officer.
there
was
nothing--
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
--that's
right.
we
have
much
more
than
that
here.
we've
got
evidence,
facts
and
all
the
supporting
evidence
to
the
light
of
which
indicated--
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
--i
don't
think
the
subjective
police
officer's
good
faith
is
enough,
that's
correct.
michigan
versus
tucker
declared
that
the
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
a
perfect
trial.
and,
consequently,
you
can't
require
police
officers
to
make
no
mistakes
whatsoever.
the
pressures
of
law
enforcement
simply
don't
permit
that
kind
of
expectation.
importantly,
i
would
point
out
that
michigan
versus
tucker
also
talked
about
the
deterrence
rationale
of
the
exclusionary
rule
and
assumed
the
police
acted
in
willful
or
at
least
negligent
ways
when
the...
when
this
rule
is
to
apply.
if
there's
good
faith
in
the
actions
of
the
police
officer
in
that
case,
that
is
the
absence
of
any
malice,
then
we
would
say
the
rule
shouldn't
apply.
when
this
deterrent
rationale
we've
talked
about
here
is
considered
in
conjunction
with
the
reviewing
standard
that
we've
said
that
probable
cause
ought
to
have,
we
find
that
it's
clear
in
this
case
that
the
motion
to
suppress
should
not
have
been
granted
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
there's
no
evidence
whatsoever
the
police
acted
in
a
willful
and
negligent
way
which
is
the
kind
of
action
that
the
exclusionary
rule
was
meant
to
deter.
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
there
wasn't
any
inquiry,
judge.
i
think
that
in
reading
the
record
that
we
see
we
can
find
that
is
a
conclusion
that
can
reasonably
be
drawn.
their
actions
in
this
case,
i
think,
can
only
be
characterized
as
thorough
and
professional.
they
had
an
anonymous
letter
which
said
that
mr.
and
mrs.
gates
were
drug
couriers.
the
letter
was
received
on
may
3,
1978,
and
it
said
that
mrs.
gates
was
leaving
for
florida
that
very
day.
it
said
that
mr.
gates
would
be
going
a
few
days
later.
the
police
had
a
very
difficult
job
to
do,
and
that
was
to
determine
whether
the
letter
had
any
validity
at
all.
they
didn't
know,
for
example,
whether
anybody
by
the
name
of
gates
lived
in
bloomingdale,
illinois.
and
so
they
had
to
check
with
the
secretary
of
state
to
find
out
if
there
was
anybody
by
the
name
of
gates
in
bloomingdale.
they
did.
and,
they
found
out
that
lance
gates
lived
there,
but
on
a
different
street
than
the
letter
said.
they
updated
that
information
through
a
confidential
informant
who
had
financial
information,
who
said
that
the
gates
had
moved
and
indeed
lived
on
greenway
terrace
like
the
letter
said.
they
checked
with
the
chicago
police
department
who
ascertained
that
a
man
by
the
name
of
gates
was
leaving
for
florida
two
days
later
on
eastern
airlines,
just
like
the
letter
said.
they
checked
with
the
phone
company.
the
phone
number
the
man
had
given
in
his
reservation
for
the
airline
checked
out
as
an
unlisted
number
to
lance
gates
on
greenway
drive
in
bloomingdale.
they
then
went
to
the
drug
enforcement
administration
and
had
an
agent
at
the
plane
who
had
a
description
of
gates,
and
saw
a
man
answering
that
description
saying
he
was
gates
get
on
the
plane.
they
had
an
agent
at
the
other
end
of
the
trip,
waiting,
observing
gates
get
off.
he
spent
an
hour
in
the
airport
and
went
to
meet
his
wife.
and
went
to
a
room
where
a
woman
was
registered
in
his
wife's
name,
which
proved
out
was
susan
gates.
they
observed
that
he
stayed
in
florida
for
about
ten
or
ten
and
a
half
hours.
and
there's
no
evidence
he
left
the
motel
at
all.
and
then
drove
back
on
the
interstate
to
chicago,
presumably
toward
chicago.
the
police
went
on
the
basis
of
that
information
which
was
all
consistent
with
the
letter.
and
all
done
over
a
day
and
a
half
or
a
two-day
stretch
and
asked
a
judge
to
issue
a
warrant
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause.
the
judge
said
that
he
felt
there
was
probable
cause
in
this
case
and
issued
a
warrant
for
both
the
car
and
for
the
house.
this
is
clearly
not
the
kind
of
activity
the
exclusionary
rule
is
meant
to
deter.
this
was
thorough
professional
police
work
over
a
day
and
a
half
or
two-day
period
involving
three
police
agencies,
the
illinois
secretary
of
state,
the
phone
company
and
a
confidential
informant.
the
the
imposition
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
case
for
purely
technical
reasons
would
deter
police
officers,
it
seems
to
us,
from
doing
their
job.
and,
certainly
deter
police
officers
from
going
to
get
warrants
because
if
the
warrant
is
not
going
to
be
given
the
kind
of
respect
that
this
court
said
it
should
have
from
jones
and
ventresca,
then
the
warrant
process
is
really
meaningless
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
police
officer
and
under
those
circumstances
he
may
resort
to
warrantless
searches
which,
of
course,
we...
this
court
has
frowned
upon.
we
think
that
there
is
a
problem
with
the
probable
cause
standard.
the
courts
have
issued
aberrant
opinions
in
this
regard.
they
have
used
artificial
standards,
aguilar-spinelli,
whatever,
they
used
artificial
standards
in
this
regard.
we
will
say
that
the
study
of
these
aberrant
opinions
which
we
have
cited
in
our
reply
brief
are
such
to
indicate
there
is
confusion
in
this
area.
we
would
ask
your
honors
to
take
this
basic
probable
cause
standard
that
you've
talked
about
in
years
past
and
apply
it
in
this
situation
and
give
due
deference
to
the
determination
of
probable
cause
made
by
the
magistrate
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
respectfully
would
reserve
whatever
time
we
have
left
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
paul
p.
biebel,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
issue
from
our
perspective
involves
an
analysis
of
this
case
according
to
a
probable
cause
standard.
we
feel
that
when
historical
definition
of
probable
cause
is
taken
into
consideration
which
envisions
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
presented
to
the
court
and
to
the
police,
we
feel
that
a
judgment
in
this
case
would
be
different.
we
feel
that
artificial
rules
often
get
in
the
way
and
cause
situations
where
there
are
aberrant
opinions
which
come
down
which
defy
common
sense
because
courts
feel
compelled
to
imply
hypertechnical
evaluations
of
the
rules
of
this
court.
mr.
reilley
talks
about
the
amicus
brief
and
the
county
eye
of
a
prosecutor
who
indicates
that
he's
had
very
few
cases
involving
suppressions.
that
may
well
be
true.
but
we
have
one
here
and
we
have
a
serious
case,
here.
we
have
people
who
are
undoubtedly
drug
couriers,
the
evidence
of
which
has
been
suppressed.
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
of
marijuana,
seven
hand
guns
and
rifles
in
their
house
and
large
amounts
of
drug
related
evidence
in
their
house.
even
though
the
cases...
even
though
there
may
be
some
dispute
as
to
the
amount
of
cases,
the
point
is
they
do
involve
serious
situations
in
many
instances.
and,
this
is
certainly
one
of
them.
we
feel
that
the
price
that
the
rule
exacts
in
this
case,
the
exclusionary
rule
exacts,
is
simply
too
high.
this
court
has
ruled.
thank
you
very
much.
