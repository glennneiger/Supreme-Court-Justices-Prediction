mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court's
question
as
stated
in
its
order
of
november
29,
is
keyed
to
the
officers'
reasonable
belief.
as
so
stated
the
question
has
been
answered
by
this
court's
precedents
which
make
it
quite
clear
that
the
exclusionary
rule
necessarily
applies
only
where,
and,
i'm
quoting
from
michigan
versus
tucker,
the
police
have
engaged
in
willful
or
at
the
very
least
negligent
conduct.
it
is
elementary
law
that
the
willful
and
the
negligent
occupy
different
parts
of
the
legal
and
behavorial
universe
from
that
which
is
reasonable.
so
that
by
very
definition
the
question
has
been
answered
by
this
court's
decisions.
the
conduct
of
a
law
enforcement
officer
in
weeks
and
mapp
as
mr.
biebel
has
told
us
was
flagrantly
abusive.
it
was
intentional.
because
it
was
intentional
it
was
susceptible
of
being
deterred.
the
present
case
is
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
from
weeks
and
mapp.
the
police
officers'
conduct
in
this
case
was
not
flagrant.
it
was
not
intentional.
it
is
the
kind
of
conduct
which
even
if
technically
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment
involves
only
disagreements
among
judges
over
subtle
and
elusive
issues
of
law.
this
is
simply
not
the
kind
of
case
to
which
the
exclusionary
rule
was
intended
to
apply
or
which
achieves
its
deterrence
objectives.
and
under
those
circumstances
this
case
is
controlled
by
a
firmly
established
principle,
established
by
this
court
in
a
consistent
line
of
decisions
reaching
back
for
at
least
fourteen
years
which
teaches
that
since
the
paramount
and
probably
the
sole
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
unlawful
police
conduct,
the
rule
applies
only
to
those
situations
where
its
deterrence
benefits
outweigh
the
costs
of
suppressing
highly
probative
evidence.
this
court's
precedents
reject
the
notion
that
the
exclusionary
rule
applies
to
any
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
that
it
must
be
applied
whenever
there
is
any
possibility
of
deterrence
however
slight.
the
answer,
the
court
said
in
stone
versus
powell,
is
to
be
found
by
weighing
the
utility
of
the
exclusionary
rule
against
the
costs
of
extending
it.
now,
let's
apply
that
task.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
under
our
scheme,
once
a
warrant
has
been
obtained,
if
the
warrant
had
been
issued
in
that
case,
then
in
all
except
the
most
unusual
of
circumstances,
and
we
do
hold
open
the
possibility
that
there
could
be
some
unusual
circumstance,
that
should
be
a
virtual
categorical
reasonable
kind
of
police
type
conduct,
and
therefore,
one
to
which
the
reasonable
belief
modification
would
apply.
now,
in
the
event
that
the
warrant
did
not
issue,
not
in
that
case,
then
you
would
have
to
judge
it
under
the
more
rule
of
reason
type
approach
to
ask
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
reasonable
belief.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
it
should
be
followed
in
the
circumstance.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
whether
there...
whether
this--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no.
in
the
event
that
the
court
would
conclude
that
the
conduct
of
the
police
was
reasonable,
and
i
think
it
very
likely
that
the
conduct
was
reasonable
in
that
case,
then
the
modification
should
apply.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
right.
not
as
rationale,
but,
it's...
the
actual
holding
of
the
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
my
recollection
is
that
they
did
not
get
the
warrant
in
that
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
let
me
address
that
question--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--not
necessarily
perfectly
all
right,
justice
o'connor.
let
me
make
two
comments
in
that
respect.
one
is
that
the
principal
focus
should
be
on
the
conduct
of
the
police
rather
than
on
the
conduct
of
the
magistrate
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
insofar
as
deterrence
is
concerned
this
court's
decisions
have
made
it
rather
clear
that
it
is
the
police
officers
with
whose
conduct
we
are
to
be
concerned.
on
the
assumption--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
and
for
that
reason
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
hold
open
the
possibility
that
in
some
future
case
there
could
be
conduct
in
which
it...
not
only
the
conduct
of
the
police,
but
also
that
of
the
magistrate
might
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
the
totality
of
governmental
conduct,
both
police
and
magistrates,
might
result
in
the
modification
which
we
urge
not
being
applicable.
but
those
would
be
unusual
circumstances
for
this
reason.
on
the
assumption
which
underlies
necessarily
the
exclusionary
rule
that
there
is
a
linkage
between
the
deterrence
of
the
police
and
the
unavailability
of
the
use
of
the
evidence
at
the
trial,
there
is
at
least
a
logical
linkage
because
the
police
are
part
of,
in
one
view,
the
overall
law
enforcement
effort.
the
linkage
is
much
more
loose
and
indeed
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
it
even
exists
when
you
focus
not
on
the
law
enforcement
officer
but
rather
on
the
magistrate.
the
magistrate's
responsibility
is
not
to
convict.
the
magistrate's
responsibility
is...
he
is
not
part
of
the
overall
law
enforcement
process.
rather
his
responsibility
improves
the
accommodation
of
both
society's
interests
and
also
the
individual's
interests.
and
as
a
consequence,
it
simply
is
not
true
that
the
deterrence
of
the
magistrate
fits
in
the
same
category
as
does
deterrence
of
the
police.
i'd
like
now
to
turn
to
the
application
of
this
court's
truth
suppression
balancing
against
deterrence
of
improper
police
conduct
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
first
of
all
on
the
cost
side,
mr.
and
mrs.
gates
were
indicted
on
the
charge
of
possession
of
marijuana.
illinois
has
some
evidence
in
its
possession
that
is
rather
relevant
to
whether
they
are
guilty.
the
illinois
police
in
executing
the
search
warrant
found
350
pounds
of
marijuana
in
the
gates'
trunk
and
more
incriminating
evidence
in
their
home.
the
only
question
is
whether
this
highly
relevant
and
probative
evidence
is
to
be
kept
from
the
jury.
surely
judicial
integrity
suffers
serious
damage
when
facts
known
to
the
judge,
the
lawyers
on
both
sides
and
to
the
defendant
are
withheld
solely
from
the
only
participants
in
the
courtroom
who
need
it
the
most.
on
the
deterrent
side
of
the
scale
assuming
arguendo
that
the
drugs
and
other
items
were
received
in
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it
is
difficult
to
perceive
any
adequate
deterrent
effect
on
future
police
misconduct
from
suppressing
this
evidence.
the
reason
is
that
the
police
did
in
this
case
exactly
what
any
reasonable
police
officers
should
do,
what
our
society
wants
them
to
do
and
what
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
that
they
should
do
wherever
possible.
they
obtained
a
search
warrant
so
that
the
probable
cause
judgment
is
made
by
one
whose
governmental
obligation
includes
the
protection
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
individual.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
if
there
are,
justice
rehnquist,
i'm
not
aware
of
them.
consider
if
you
will,
the
course
which
the
present
law
requires
the
policeman
to
steer
when
he
is
operating
as
he
usually
is
within
that
indistinct
fourth
amendment
boundary
between
the
lawful
and
the
unlawful.
on
the
one
hand
we
require
him
not
to
be
too
aggressive
and
very
properly
so
lest
individual
fourth
amendment
rights
not
be
violated.
it
is
equally
important
however
that
he
not
be
overly
timid
lest
criminal
activity
go
unpunished,
undetected,
or
worst
of
all,
unprevented.
that
kind
of
obligation
to
steer
between
the
scylla
of
his
law
enforcement
obligation
and
the
charybdis
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
probably
unavoidable.
but
what
is
not
unavoidable
is
the
consequence
that
we
impose
on
him
if
by
hindsight
we
discover
that
he
has
made
even
the
slightest
technical
deviation
from
the
perfect
course.
if
we
turn
our
backs
on
the
evidence
that
he
has
obtained
just
because
he
has
not
been
successful
in
forecasting
judicial
decisions,
then
that
is
not
only
freeing
the
criminal
because
the
constable
has
blundered.
that
is
freeing
the
criminal
because
the
constable
is
something
less
than
omniscient.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
indeed--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--and,
indeed,
justice
marshall,
it
is
not
terribly
profitable
to
place
the
blame.
and
indeed
the
nub
of
the
solution
to
the
problem
is
contained
within
this
court's
decisions,
at
least
a
dozen
of
them,
which
have
made
it
very
clear
that
the
proper
approach
in
this
instance
is
to
take
into
account
that
kind
of
dilemma
that
the
police
officer
faces.
and
ask
whether,
in
fact,
he
is
going
to
be
deterred
by
excluding
this
evidence
in
this
particular
instance.
and
by
definition,
if
we
believe
what
this
court
said
in
michigan
versus
tucker,
and
i
submit
it
is
absolutely
correct,
that
it
can
only
be
to
deter
either
negligent
or
willful
conduct.
then
by
very
definition,
this
court's
answer
has
to
be
given
in
our
favor.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
there
are
other
methods
of
course,
justice
marshall.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
are
of
course
the
possibilities
of
tort
remedies
and
many
trials
to
be
held,
after
the
trial.
and
those
kinds
of
issues
would
have
to
be
taken
into
account
if
we
were
urging
the
abolition
of
the
exclusionary
rule
itself.
we
are
not.
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
it
is
simply...
it
is
fairly
a
close
question
as
to
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
itself
is
justifiable.
and
that
has
excited
debate
both
scholarly
and
judicial.
but
this
case
presents
a
much
easier
question.
and
it
is
in
those
instances
where
by
very
definition,
being
keyed
as
it
is
to
reasonable
belief,
the
deterrent
effect
varies
somewhere
between
the
non-existent
and
the
very
minimal,
then
the
balancing
test
that
this
court
has
set
down
in
such
cases
as
calandra
and
janis,
stone,
and
many
others,
operates
to
permit
the
evidence.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
are
two
deterrents.
one
is,
of
course,
judicial
review
of
the
magistrate's
decision.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
appropriate
instances
that
would
be
one
of
the
remedies.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
brings
me
to
another
question
that
i
do
want
to
discuss.
and
that
is,
in
appropriate
instances
where
the
reasonable
belief
modification
might
be
dispositive
of
the
particular
case,
but
nonetheless,
the
reviewing
court
might
conclude
that
it
is
appropriate
to
review,
to
not
go
immediately
to
the
reasonable
belief
modification
issue
but
rather
consider
first
the
substantive
fourth
amendment
issue,
either
the
propriety
of
the
warrant
or
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
that
context.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
let
me
answer
that
one.
i
think
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
we
are
talking
about
the
reasonable
belief
of
the
police.
however--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--in
this
case
we
are
talking
about
the
reasonable
belief
of
the
police.
i
see
no
indication
whatever
that
judge
lewis
acted
improperly.
we
are
not
ruling
out
the
possibility
that
it
could
be
taken
into
account
in
some
cases.
we
think
that
ought
to
be
resolved
on
a
case
to
case
basis.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
our
view
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
warrant.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
if
you
reach
that
conclusion
and
you
decide
that
you
want
to
base
your
decision
on
that
issue
then
of
course,
that
can
be
done.
but
i
had
inferred
from
the
fact
that
the
case
was
set
down
for
reargument,
that
there
was
a
purpose
in
in
searching
out
this
additional
issue.
and,
this
issue,
of
course,
also
can
be
a
basis
for
deciding
the
case
in
the
future.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
certainly...
excuse
me,
proper
for
what?
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
certainly
not.
but,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
certainly
was
probable
cause
for
judge
lewis
to
issue
the
warrant
that
he
did.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
improperly,
could
not
issue
a
warrant
on
less
than
probable
cause.
let
me
just
deal
briefly--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--under
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
there
will
be
additional
opportunities--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--in
the
great
majority
of
instances
that
will
be
true.
we
don't
know
whether
there
will
be
exceptions
or
not.
certainly
if
there
has
been
a
judgment
by
a
judge--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
don't
know
if
there
would
be
any.
i
think
that
those
should
await
the
further
development
of--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
think
that's
correct.
there
will
be
other
opportunities
for
this
court
to
decide
fourth
amendment
cases
even
if
it
should
rule
and
in
this
case
as...
as
in
our
view
the
court
should.
in
the
first
place
there
are
alleged
fourth
amendment
violations
involving
a
pan
of
practice
of
official
conduct
can
often
be
challenged
in
a
civil
suit
or
declaratorium
injunctive
release.
for
example,
in
torres
versus
puerto
rico
in
which
this
court
held
unconstitutional
a
puerto
rican
statute
making
it...
authorizing
police
to
search
the
luggage
of
any
person
arriving
in
puerto
rico
from
the
united
states
could
have
been
resolved
in
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
relief
by
a
regular
traveler
to
puerto
rico.
similarly
under
section
1983,
suits
can
be
dropped
against
municipalities
for
constitutional
torts
resulting
from
implementation
of
local
ordinances,
regulations,
policies,
or
even
customary
practices.
in
addition,
there
is
at
least
some
likelihood
that
some
states
would
decline
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
adopt
a
reasonable
belief
modification
to
their
own
state
exclusionary
rules.
and
the
ruling
of
the
courts
of
those
states
on
underlying
fourth
amendment
issues
could
be
reviewed
by
this
court.
and,
finally
even
in
the
prosecutions
themselves,
we
see
no
credential
or
constitutional
impediment
to
the
courts
deciding
the
substantive
issue
rather
than
going
immediately
to
the
remedial
issue.
we
would
call
in
this
respect
to
the
court's
attention
the
case
of
o'connor
versus
donaldson
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief,
422
u.s.
563,
in
which
the
court
did
exactly
that
in
a
civil
damage
suit.
it
reached
the
constitutional
issue
first,
and
then
remanded
for
determination
whether
there
was
a
good
faith
immunity
defense
available
to
the
defendant
under
the
circumstances
of
that
case.
closing,
within
a
fairly
short
time
after
mapp
versus
ohio
came
down
and
consistently
ever
since
then
the
court
has
consistently
identified
instances
in
which
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
apply
because
its
truth
seeking
costs
out
weigh
its
deterrence
benefits.
those
individual
holdings
have
been
sufficient
in
number
and
sufficient
in
their
consistency
that
it
is
now
apparent
that
they
constitute
more
than
just
parts
of
a
whole.
that
there
is,
in
addition,
a
whole
principle
itself.
it
remains
only
to
declare
the
existence
of
that
principle
which
is
clearly
applicable
to
this
case
where
the
action
of
the
police
officers
was
reasonable.
under
those
circumstances
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
to
that
court.
