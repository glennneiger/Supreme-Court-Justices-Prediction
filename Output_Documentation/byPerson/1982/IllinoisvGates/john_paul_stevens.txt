justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
interrupt
you
with
a
question,
mr.
biebel.
do
you
think
there's
any
distinction
for
purposes
of
analysis
in
the
portion
of
the
warrant
that
authorized
the
search
of
the
car,
which
i
guess
was
done
immediately
when
it
returned,
and
the
portion
of
the
warrant
that
authorized
the
search
of
the
apartment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
corroboration
of
the
fact
that...
i
understand
all
your
theory
on
the
corroboration
of
what
was
in
the
trunk
of
the
vehicle,
which
presumably
was
sent
down
to
get
back
up
there.
but
what
other
than
the
information
in
the
letter
itself
supported
the
view
that
there
was
something
to
be
found
in
the
apartment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
was
there
any
corroboration
of
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
presume
that...
on
a
drug
trip
like
this...
that
the
stuff
would
always
be
placed
in
the
apartment
of
the
driver?
is
that
what
you
assume?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
not
think
your
case
was
any
stronger
on
the
car
part
than
on
the
house
part,
is
what
i'm
after.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
were
apprehended
just
as
they
arrived
back,
weren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
biebel,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
the
possible
distinction
between
the
car
and
the
premises.
in
your
brief
you
made
the
point
that
one
of
the
corroborating
circumstances
tending
to
support
the
conclusion
that
the
drugs
might
have
been
in
the
apartment
was
the
fact
that
the
informant
said
that
the
woman
would
go
to
florida
and
leave
the
car
and
come
back
before
the
husband
left,
so
that
the
apartment
would
not
be
unattended
for
a
long
period
of
time,
indicating
probably
concern
about
what
was
in
the
apartment.
but
yet,
when
they
verified
the
facts,
that
scenario
did
not
take
place.
instead,
she
stayed
in
florida
until
he
came
down
there
and
they
did
in
fact
leave
the
apartment
unattended,
which
would
seem
to
undermine
the
basis
for
the
suspicion
that
goods
were
in
the
apartment
during
that
interval.
so
i
would
think
there
would
be
less
basis
for
your
conclusion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
was
a
two-day
stretch,
which
would
have
been
consistent
with
the
notion
that
they
were
getting
drugs
which
might
eventually
be
placed
in
the
apartment,
but
there
might
not
have
been
drugs
in
the
apartment
during
their
absence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
notice
in
that
connection
that
the
officers,
although
they
had
a
warrant
to
search
the
apartment,
did
not
do
so
until
they
searched
the
car.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
your
view
of
the
law,
supposing
the
car
had
oranges
in
the
trunk
or
something
other
than
what
they
expected.
would
they
have
nevertheless
had
the
authority
under
your
view
to
enter
the
apartment,
or
did
their
entry
in
the
apartment
depend
on
their
finding
drugs
in
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we've
got
all
the
circumstances
before
us.
do
you
think
that
totality
would
justify
an
entry
into
the
apartment
if
they
had
not
found
drugs
in
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
are
relying
on
what
they
uncovered
in
the
search
of
the
car
to
justify
the
entry
to
the
apartment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
you
still
taking
the
position
there
was
enough
to
enter
the
apartment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
contend,
mr.
biebel,
that
you
can
look
at
any
circumstances
after
the
warrant
issued?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
then,
in
this
case
the
fact
that
the
car
came
back
to
chicago
after
the
warrant
was
issued
was
not
relevant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but,
you
didn't
know
it
till
it
got
back
to
chicago--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
you
knew
was
that
it
left
florida,
actually.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
whatever
information
the
police
obtained
after
the
warrant
was
issued
you
do
not
ask
us
to
consider,
that's
all
i'm
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
nathanson
case
in
which
the
officer
was
confident
that
there
was
probable
cause,
but
the
magistrate
disagreed...
i
mean
the
magistrate,
based
on
what
the
officer's
conclusions
was
enough.
would
you...
are
you
asking
us
to
reexamine
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by...
by
the
police
officer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
to
this
day,
we
presumedly
believe
he
had
probable
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
contending,
in
other
words,
that
the
good
faith
of
the
police
officer
is
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
let
me
just
ask
one
question.
your
brief
doesn't
cite
the
nathanson
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
put
that
into
your
scheme
of
things.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
confess,
i'm
not
clear.
do
you
say
we
should
overrule
the
nathanson
case
or
follow
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
there
was...
i
don't
quite
understand
why.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
there
was
no
misconduct,
no
negligence
or
willfulness
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words
we
should
overrule
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
same
facts
arose
again
we
should
decide
it
differently.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
they
did
get
the
warrant
in
the
nathanson
case.
they
did
get
a
warrant?
yes.
mr.
lee,
what
happens
under
your
approach
in
this
case
to
improper
determinations,
even
flagrant
ones,
by
the
magistrate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
you're
talking
entirely,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
about
deterrence
effect
on
the
police.
is
there
any
mechanism
or
do
you
think
there
should
be
to
deter
magistrates
from
violating
the
explicit
words
of
the
fourth
amendment,
no
warrant
shall
issue
expect
on
probable
cause.
what
deterrent
should
be
applied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
think
the
magistrate's
decision
is
not
supported
by
probable
cause,
should
the
judge
then
set
aside
the
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
thought
your
whole
argument
is
that
even
though
there
is
no
probable
cause
here
the
warrant
should
stand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
going
a
little
too
fast
for
me,
mr.
solicitor
general.
whose
reasonable
belief
are
we
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
talking
about
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assume
for
a
moment...
what
is
your
position.
was
there
or
was
there
not
probable
cause
for
the
warrant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
do
we
reach
all
these
other
issues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
now,
let
me
ask
it
this
way.
assuming
there
was
not
probable
cause
arguendo
for
the
warrant,
would
you
say
that
the
magistrate's
action
was
nevertheless
proper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then,
you're
saying
that
it's
proper
for
a
magistrate
to
issue
a
warrant
on
less
than
probable
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
a
magistrate
to
issue
a
warrant
on
less
than
probable
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
you
said
that.
but
if
you
also
assume
because
the
case
is
being
reargued
and
all,
that
there
was
not
probable
cause
for
the
warrant.
under
that
assumption
did
the
magistrate
act
properly
or
improperly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
be
sure
i
understand.
you're
saying
that
whenever
a
warrant
issues,
the
police
officer's
justification
is
justified
in
going
forward
with
the
search.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that...
that's
all
this
has
been
in
the
hypothesis
if
you've
got
a
warrant.
what,
if
any,
would
be
a
situation
in
which
the
officer
should
not
execute
the
warrant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
clearly
are
overruling
the
nathanson
case.
that
is
clear.
