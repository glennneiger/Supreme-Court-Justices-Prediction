mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
search
and
seizure
case.
it
involves
the
question
of
whether
or
not
probable
cause
for
the
establishment
of
a
search
warrant
can
be
established
where
an
anonymous
letter
is
sent
to
a
police
department
and
many
of
the
items
of
that
anonymous
letter
are
then
corroborated
by
the
police.
here,
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant,
the
car
and
the
apartment
of
lance
and
susan
gates
were
searched
and
large
quantities
of
drugs
were
seized.
however,
a
motion
to
suppress
was
granted
by
the
trial
court,
dupage
county,
illinois.
that
suppression
was
affirmed
by
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
and
affirmed
once
again
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court.
the
pertinent
facts
are
these.
on
may
3rd,
1978,
the
bloomingdale,
illinois
police
department
received
an
anonymous
letter
which
was
postmarked
may
2nd,
1978.
that
letter
said
that
there
was
a
couple
living
in
bloomingdale,
lance
and
sue
gates,
who
lived
on
greenway
in
the
condominiums
who
made
their
living
off
drugs.
most
of
their
buys,
according
to
the
letter,
were
done
in
florida.
sue
would
drive
a
car
down
to
florida;
lance
would
fly
down
later
and
drive
the
car
back.
the
letter
specifically
stated
that
on
may
3rd,
sue
would
be
driving
down
to
florida
and
lance
would
be
flying
down
a
couple
of
days
later
to
drive
the
car
back.
the
letter
stated
that
the
car
would
contain
$100,000
worth
of
drugs
in
the
trunk,
and
that
there
are
about
$100,000
worth
of
drugs
in
the
couple's
apartment
in
the
basement.
further,
the
letter
said
that
the
gates
brag
about
the
fact
that
they
don't
have
to
work
and
that
they
make
their
money
off
pushers.
finally,
they
indicated
that
the
gates's
were
friends
with
drug
dealers
who
visit
their
house
often.
upon
receipt
of
this
letter
on
may
3rd,
1978,
the
case
was
assigned
to
detective
charles
mader
of
the
bloomingdale
police
department
who
did
several
things
to
check
whether
or
not
this
letter
was
accurate.
first
of
all,
he
checked
with
the
illinois
secretary
of
state
to
ascertain
whether
anybody
with
a
driver's
license
by
the
name
of
gates
lived
in
bloomingdale,
and
he
checked
and
he
found
out
that,
indeed,
a
lance
gates
lived
in
bloomingdale;
however,
he
lived
on
dartmouth
avenue,
which
was
different
from
the
letter.
the
secretary
of
state
provided
a
description
of
mr.
gates.
he
was
a
male,
white,
born
in
1947,
brown
eyes,
brown
hair,
five
feet,
eleven,
220
pounds.
because
of
the
discrepancy
in
the
information
of
the
secretary
of
state,
detective
mader
went
further
and
checked
with
an
anonymous
informant
who
had
provided
reliable
information
in
the
past,
which
gave
him
information
from
financial
records
which
his
informant
had
which
indicated
that
mr.
gates
lived
on
greenway,
which
was
consistent
with
the
letter,
and
that
his
prior
address
was
on
dartmouth,
which
would
indicate
that
he
had
let
his
driver's
license,
in
effect...
he
didn't
follow
it
up
with
the
new
address.
detective
mader
then
went
and
checked
with
the
chicago
police
department
who
has
responsibility
for
o'hare
field
and
ascertained
that
an
l.
gates
was
slated
to
go
out
on
flight
245
on
eastern
airlines
to
atlanta
and
west
palm
beach,
florida
at
4:15
on
may
5th,
which
would
be
consistent
with
the
letter.
a
phone
number
was
given
for
l.
gates,
who
had
registered.
detective
mader
then
contacted
the
security
office
of
the
illinois
bell
telephone
company
and
found
out
that
that
phone
number
was
an
unlisted
number
to
lance
gates
who
lived
on
greenway
drive
in
bloomingdale,
illinois.
detective
mader
then
checked
with
the
drug
enforcement
administration,
and
they
had
an
agent
out
at
o'hare
field
waiting
to
watch
the
people
get
on
flight
245.
a
man
identifying
himself
as
lance
gates
and
meeting
the
description
got
on
that
plane.
drug
enforcement
agents
were
in
florida
when
that
plane
landed
and
they
watched
mr.
gate
get
off
the
plane,
they
watched
him
stay
at
the
airport
for
about
an
hour,
and
then
they
observed
that
he
took
a
cab
directly
to
the
west
palm
beach
holiday
inn.
he
was
observed
entering
the
room,
registered
to
susan
gates.
the
record
will
not
reflect
what
time
he
arrived,
but
it
had
to
be
about
8:00
o'clock,
considering
the
lapse
in
time
and
the
delay
of
an
hour
in
the
airport.
within
12
hours,
at
7:00
o'clock
the
next
morning,
mr.
gates
and
an
unidentified
female
left,
checked
out,
got
into
an
automobile
with
license
plates
registered
to
lance
gates
and
headed
back
on
the
interstate,
presumably
towards
chicago.
a
check
of
the
license
plates
indicated
that
the
plates
were
registered
to
a
car
other
than
being
driven
in
this
case.
it
was
estimated
by
the
drug
agents
that
the
driving
time
from
west
palm
beach,
florida
to
bloomingdale,
illinois
was
about
21
to
23
hours.
now,
this
was
may
6th
in
the
morning.
in
the
evening
of
may
6th,
which
was
a
saturday,
detective
mader
went
and
presented
his
information
to
a
judge
who
issued
a
search
warrant
for
the
car
and
for
the
apartment
based
on
the
anonymous
letter
and
the
corroboration
of
the
letter.
the
search
warrant
was
executed
at
5:14
the
next
morning,
which
was
some
23
hours
after
the
gates's
had
left
florida,
which
would
indicate
virtually
a
non-stop
trip.
in
the
trunk
of
the
automobile
were
several
large
bundles
of
marijuana
weighing
about
350
pounds.
a
search
of
their
residence
uncovered
more
marijuana,
weapons,
ammunition,
drug
paraphernalia,
several
scales
presumably
for
the
weighing
of
the
drugs.
the
couple
also
had
cocaine
in
their
possession.
both
were
indicted
for
unlawful
possession
of
cannabis
with
intent
to
deliver
and
unlawful
possession
of
a
controlled
substance,
and
lance
gates
was
separately
indicted
for
possession
of
an
unlicensed
firearm.
however,
a
motion
to
suppress
was
granted
by
the
circuit
court
of
dupage
county,
illinois
by
judge
william
hopf
who
indicated
that
neither
prong
of
the
aguilar
or
spinelli
test
were
met
here.
there
was
no
indication
in
the
letter
of
the
basis
of
the
knowledge
of
the
letter
writer,
and
there
was
nothing
to
substantiate
his
reliability.
that
was
affirmed
by
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
section
district
in
1980
where
that
court,
admittedly
disagreeing
with
several
state
and
federal
cases,
held
that
corroboration
by
the
police
can
only
be
used
to
satisfy
the
veracity
prong
of
aguilar
and
spinelli
and
cannot
be
used
to
satisfy
the
basis
of
knowledge
prong.
and
since
there
was
no
basis
of
knowledge
indicated,--
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
--aguilar
just
set
out
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
the
two
steps
that
have
to
be
utilized
when
informants
are
used.
i
think
it
was
explicated
in
the
spinelli
case,
and
certainly
there's
been
a
great
deal
of
comment
by
courts
and
a
law
review
article
since
about
the
two-prong
test
and
how
it's
described.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
we
would
certainly
contend
not
so,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
basis
of
our
case
here.
if
aguilar
and
spinelli...
we
would
argue
that
aguilar
and
spinelli
ought
to
be
carefully
re-examined
by
this
court
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it's
overly
formalistic
and
it's
confused
courts
and
police
officers
and
prosecutors.
but
beyond
that,
i
don't
think
that
aguilar
and
spinelli
was
meant
to
apply
to
a
situation
such
as
here
where
you
have
an
anonymous
letter
writer
who
volunteers
information.
i
think
there's
a
distinct
difference
between
that
and
a
police
informant
where
there
may
well
be
ulterior
motives
by
a
police
informant
to
lie.
the
appellate
court
of
illinois,
taking
this
formalistic
approach,
said
we're
sorry,
but
the
corroboration
of
the
police
can
only
go
to
veracity
and
it
can't
go
to
the
basis
of
knowledge.
and
so
there
wasn't
any
facial
indication
of
basis
of
knowledge
on
the
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant;
it
had
to
fall.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
affirmed
the
appellate
court
but
didn't
go
quite
as
far.
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
ward
over
dissents
by
mr.
justices
moran
and
underwood,
they
held
that
neither
prong
was
met.
they
didn't
feel
that
the
corroboration
in
this
case
of
what
they
described
as
clearly
innocent
activity
was
sufficient
to
meet
either
prong.
however,
they
didn't
get
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
corroboration
can
be
used
to
supply
the
basis
of
knowledge
prong.
the
dissents,
however,
said
in
that
case
that
every
detail
of
the
letter
was
corroborated,
like
draper
versus
the
united
states,
and
consequently,
both
prongs
were
satisfied
and
probable
cause
was
properly
granted.
it
is
our
contention
in
this
case,
your
honors,
that
probable
cause
here
for
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant
was
properly
shown.
the
probable
cause
standards
enunciated
by
this
court
in
cases
such
as
draper,
brinegar,
carroll,
is
whether
the
facts
and
circumstances
are
such
as
to
warrant
a
reasonably
prudent
man
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed.
and
when
search
warrants
are
involved,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
items
are
probably
present
in
their
location.
since
probable
cause
requires
less
evidence
than
is
required
to
justify
conviction,
hearsay
can
be
used
to
establish
probable
cause
as
long
as
there
is
a
substantial
basis
for
crediting
the
hearsay,
as
this
court
has
enunciated
in
jones,
rugendorf,
harris
and
the
like.
here,
the
hearsay
evidence
supplied
by
the
anonymous
letter
writer,
coupled
by
the
corroboration
of
the
police
of
the
details
of
the
letter,
were
sufficient
to
warrant
a
reasonably
prudent
man
in
believing
that
the
drugs
were
probably
located
where
the
anonymous
letter
writer
said
they
were.
this
letter
described
a
classic
drug
run
rather
than
an
ordinary
social
or
business
trip.
and
the
predictions
of
the
letter
are
exactly
what
occurred--
lance
gates
flew
down
to
florida,
a
place
that
the
drug
enforcement
administration
has
identified
as
a
major
port
of
entry
of
illegal
narcotics
into
the
united
states;
a
point
that
this
court
can
take
judicial
knowledge
of,
as
it
did
in
carroll
with
the
role
that
detroit
played
with
regard
to
illegal
liquor
during
prohibition.
he
stayed
less
than
12
hours
in
florida,
turned
around
in
the
automobile
that
his
wife
apparently
had
brought
down
there
and
drove
back
virtually
non-stop
to
bloomingdale,
illinois,
arriving
at
his
apartment
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
a
sunday.
the
letter
was
correct,
therefore,
not
only
in
its
conclusion
that
the
gates
were
running
drugs,
but
also
in
the
specifics
of
the
trip.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
gone
off
and
said
that
this
was
clearly
innocent
activity.
we
would
like
to
note
that
that
should
not
make
a
difference
as
long
as
that
activity,
along
with
the
tip
itself,
is
enough
to
supply
probable
cause.
certainly,
in
the
draper
case
which
i'll
make
reference
to
in
a
minute,
you
had
clearly
innocent
activity
which,
combined
with
a
tip,
was
judged
to
be
enough
for
probable
cause.
furthermore,
there
is
an
absence
of
an
apparent
motive
to
lie
in
this
case.
with
police
informants
who
are
often
either
paid
or
receive
some
sort
of
leniency
or
protection
or
perhaps
pressure
to
produce
information
by
the
police,
there
are
oftentimes
those
pressures
to
lie.
here,
the
anonymous
letter,
however,
volunteered
the
information.
and
therefore,
it
should
be
given
credence
like
a
citizen
informant
and
presumed
to
be
credible.
consequently,
because
of
the
detail
of
the
letter
which
indicated
specifically
the
time
that
they
would
go
down
to
florida
and
how
they
would
come
back,
which
proved
to
be
true,
because
of
the
absence
of
an
apparent
motive
to
lie,
because
of
the
extensive
police
corroboration
in
this
case
which
took
in
three
police
departments,
post
office,
financial
records,
because
of
the
inherently
suspicious
nature
of
the
trip,
which
was
a
short
round-trip
staying
less
than
12
hours
in
an
area
known
to
be
source
of
narcotics,
because
of
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant--
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
--it
occurred
in
may,
judge.
all
taken
together,
all
these
factors
taken
together
we
believe
amply
justify
the
judge's
determination
of
probable
cause,
particularly
when
you
view
that
preference
ought
to
be
given
to
search
warrants
as
opposed
to
warrantless
searches,
as
this
court
has
often
said
in
cases
such
as
ventresca.
i
might
note
that
probable
cause
has
been
found
by
this
court
in
cases
with
less
evidence
than
presented
here.
in
adams
versus
williams,
an
opinion
of
this
court,
1972,
a
policeman
in
bridgeport,
connecticut
in
the
early
morning
hours
was
told
by
an
informant,
who
had
only
given
information
on
one
prior
occasion
and
that
had
to
do
with
alleged
homosexual
activity
in
a
railroad
station
which
did
not
result
in
any
arrest
because
it
had
been
unsubstantiated...
that
person
told
the
police
officer
that
the
defendant
was
sitting
in
a
specific
location
in
an
automobile;
that
he
had
a
gun
in
his
waist
and
that
there
were
substantial
amounts
of
drugs
in
the
car.
the
police
officer
went
up
to
check
the
man,
asked
him
to
open
the
car
door.
he
simply
rolled
down
the
window.
the
policeman
then
reached
in
and
found
a
gun
in
the
man's
waistband,
precisely
where
the
informant
said
it
would
be.
on
the
basis
of
this,
he
then
had
a
warrantless
search
of
the
automobile
and
the
man's
person
and
found
heroin...
substantial
amounts
of
heroin,
both
on
his
person
and
in
the
car.
this
court,
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
said
that
when
we're
dealing
with
probable
cause
we're
dealing
with
probabilities;
we're
not
dealing
with
technicalities.
and
since
the
gun
was
found
precisely
where
the
informant
said
it
would
be,
then
it
predicted...
was
reasonable
to
corroborate
the
reliability
of
the
informant
that
drugs
would
be
in
the
car
as
well
as
the
gun
in
the
man's
waistband.
the
theory
of
adams
was
premised
upon
draper
versus
the
united
states
where
a
reliable
informant
precisely
described
the
attire
that
mr.
draper
would
be
wearing,
that
he
would
be
carrying
a
tan
zippered
bag
and
that
he
would
be
walking
quickly.
he
also
indicated
that
mr.
draper
would
be
getting
off
a
train
from
chicago
in
denver,
and
he
would
be
carrying
heroin.
the
police
watched
the
train
for
two
days.
the
second
day
they
saw
a
man
meeting
that
description
get
off
the
train,
carrying
a
brown
zippered
bag
and
walking
quickly.
on
the
basis
of
that
information,
they
stopped
the
man,
they
searched
him
without
a
warrant
and
they
found
three
ounces
of
heroin
on
him,
as
the
informant
said
they
would.
this
court
found
there
was
probable
cause
in
that
case
because
the
preciseness
of
the
description
in
draper
gave
support
to
the
truthfulness
of
the
statement
that
draper
was
carrying
heroin.
we
contend
that
this
case
is
stronger
than
either
adams
or
draper
because
here
there
was
extensive
police
corroboration
of
activity
that
was
less
innocent
than
either
adams
or
draper.
in
adams,
the
man
was
sitting
in
a
car;
in
draper
the
man
was
simply
getting
off
a
train
and
walking
away
quickly,
carrying
a
bag.
here
we
have
all
the
earmarks

hours,

to
bloomingdale,
illinois.
because
the
anonymous
letter
writer
in
our
case
was
precisely
correct
in
the
way
the
trip
would
go
down,
in
the
days...
concerning
the
days
that
the
trip
would
take,
it
was,
we
believe,
a
justifiable
decision
by
the
court
that
this
would
indicate
that
the
further
allegations
of
the
anonymous
letter
were
true,
too,
and
that
is
that
they
were
carrying
drugs.
and,
in
fact,
that
was
the
case.
probable
cause
should
therefore
be
granted
in
this
case,
as
it
was
in
adams,
as
it
was
in
draper,
which
i
said
were
both
warrantless
cases.
if
there
is
a
question
in
favor
or
not
in
favor
of
a
case
if
a
warrant
has
been
issued,
then
preference
ought
to
be
given
to
the
warrant.
however,
the
difficulty
arises
in
cases
such
as
this
because
of
the
application
by
the
lower
courts
of
the
two-prong
aguilar
and
spinelli
test
to
a
situation
involving
other
than
a
police
informant.
here
we
have
an
anonymous
letter
writer.
because
a
hearsay
declaration
is
unknown
to
a
magistrate
or
a
judge
who
is
required
to
determine
probable
cause
for
a
warrant,
the
two-prong
test
was
established
to
require
police
to
state
to
the
judge
first
of
all,
the
basis
for
why
they
believe
that
the
informant
has
veracity,
and
secondly,
what
information
the
informant
has
to
indicate
that
he
believes
that
a
crime
has
been
committed.
but
according
to
some
courts,
including
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
in
this
case,
when
information
comes
from
other
than
a
police
informant...
in
this
case,
an
anonymous
letter
writer,
volunteering
information...
the
information
is
per
se
defective
if
there
are
not
enough...
there
isn't
a
basis
for
the
knowledge
facially
indicated
on
the
request
for
a
warrant
or
on
the
letter,
and
there
are
not
enough
facts
to
permit
self-verification,
as
this
court
utilized
in
the
spinelli
case.
the
appellate
court
citing
judge
moilan,
who
is
often
cited
in
this
area
in
his
case,
stanley
versus
the
state,
an
intermediate
appellate
court
in
maryland,
1974
opinion,
that
police
corroboration,
though
relevant
in
determining
veracity,
cannot
be
used
to
satisfy
the
basis
of
knowledge
prong.
we
respectfully
contend
that
that
conclusion
finds
no
support
in
the
opinions
of
this
court.
it
reduces
the
standards
of
determining
probable
cause
to
ones
of
form
over
substance.
and
furthermore,
it
avoids
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
ventresca
that
fourth
amendment
issues
ought
to
be
considered
in
a
common
sense
fashion
rather
than
an
over-formalistic
fashion
because
search
warrants,
requests
for
search
warrants
are
often
drafted
by
non-lawyers
in
the
midst
and
in
the
hiatus
of
criminal
investigations,
which
is
just
exactly
what
occurred
here.
the
police
really
had
a
very
short
time
in
order
to
whether
or
not
this
information
was
reliable.
we
find
it
ironic
that
under
the
appellate
court
opinion,
which
has
accepted
the
moilan
theory,
that
a
basis
for
knowledge
can
be
obtained
by
non-corroborated
statements
in
a
letter,
but
cannot
be
supplied
by
the
kind
of
extensive
corroboration
seen
in
this
case.
if
the
appellate
court
theory
is
maintained
here,
then
an
anonymous
letter
which
does
not
supply
sufficient
facts
to
indicate
a
basis
of
knowledge
can
never
be
utilized
for
the
determination
of
probable
cause
because
the
corroboration
by
the
police
simply
can't
be
used
to
bolster
the
basis
of
knowledge
prong.
it
simply
defies
common
sense,
because
corroboration
can
be
utilized
not
only
to
show
the
veracity
of
a
declarant,...
and
certainly
this
court
has
said
that...
but
also
to
indicate
that
there
are
enough
verified
facts
to
justify
a
finding
that
the
letter
was
not
based
on
conjecture
or
on
rumor.
in
the
draper
case,
certainly,
the
self-verifying
facts
only
became
verified
because
the
police
corroborated
what
occurred.
they
saw
that
the
man
had
the
same
clothing
as
the
informant
said,
that
he
was
carrying
a
bag
as
the
informant
said,
and
that
he
would
be
walking
quickly.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
if
you
take
the--
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
--the
letter
said
that
there
were
$100,000
worth
of
drugs
in
the
car
as
well--
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
--no.
i
think
the
corroboration
simply
has
to
do
with
the
kind
of
drug
trip
that
was
taken
and
it's
reasonable
for
a
judge
to
take
the
further
step
and
say
they've
got
them
in
the
car,
and
they
have
them,
as
the
declarant
says,
in
the
apartment
as
well.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
i
don't
think
you
can
make
that
presumption
particularly,
but
when
it
is
alleged
in
the
letter
and
when
the
letter
proves
to
be
true
in
every
basic
aspect,
then
i
think
that
the
judge
can
together
indicate
that
there
is
probable
cause.
the
tip
and
the
corroboration.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
i
think
the
case
is
probably
stronger
on
the
car
part,
certainly,
because
they
drove
the
car
and
there
was
more
in
the
letter
about
the
car
than
the
apartment,
but
i
would
say
that
the
same
theory
would
hold
true--
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
--they
were
waiting
for
them
when
they
arrived
at
5:15
in
the
morning.
i
might
note
that
this
two-pronged
test
has
caused
severe
problems
for
other
courts
who
have
been
required
to
consider
it
when
there
haven't
been
the
traditional
police
informant
cases.
the
united
states
versus
bell,
for
example,
cited
at
page
19
of
our
brief
involved
a
situation
where
an
arrest
warrant
was
quashed
because
the
supporting
affidavit
did
not
attest
to
the
credibility
and
reliability
of
the
eyewitness
in
that
case.
the
eyewitness.
the
fifth
circuit,
however,
reversed
and
said
that
aguilar
and
spinelli
was
not
meant
to
pertain
to
situations
like
this
and
should
be
limited
to
police
informants
only.
similarly,
in
united
states
versus
burke
that
is
cited
in
our
brief,
the
second
circuit
noted
that
there's
been
a
growing
recognition
that
the
two-pronged
test
ought
to
be
addressed
to
professional
informants
and
should
not
be
applied
in
a
wooden
fashion
to
citizen
informants
such
as
witnesses
or
as
victims.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
it
could
be
either,
judge.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
not
under
the
standards
of
this
court
in
nathanson
and
cases
such
as
this.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
i
don't
mean
what
i
said
about
what?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
what
i
am
simply
saying
is
that
i
think
the
two-pronged
test
gets
overly
formalistic,
and
what
you
ought
to
do
is
you
ought
to
take
the
tip
that's
involved...
and
in
this
instance
we
have
a
tip
from
an
anonymous
informant
and
not
a
police
informant.
when
there's
a
police
informant,
the
police
have,
it
seems
to
me,
an--
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
--certainly,
and
i
think
the
basis
has
been
shown
here.
we
had
the
tip,
albeit
we
don't
know
who
it
was
that
made
the
tip.
but
there
was
ample
corroboration
made,
and
the
suspicious
nature
of
the
trip
indicates
that
the
situation
was
as
the
declarant
said.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
no,
i'm
saying
that
in
a
situation
that
in
this
case,
as
the
appellate
court
did,
they
said
there
is
no
showing
of
a
basis
for
belief.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
i
think
that
what
we're
moving
to,
and
you
can
see
it
in
our
brief
and
the
solicitor's
brief,
you
will
see,
i
think
you
get
caught
up
in
the
really
confusing
aspects
of
two
prongs;
a
basis
for
belief
and
the
veracity
prong.
rather,
we
ought
to
go
back,
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
common
sense
approach:
is
there
substantial
evidence
to
establish
the
probable
cause.
it
was
shown
here.
and
there
are
many
cases,
carroll,
husty,
brinegar,
chambers,
adams
versus
williams,
where
if
you
take
a
strict
two-pronged
analysis,
probable
cause
may
not
be
found.
but
what
the
court
did
in
those
cases
was
look
at
the
case,
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
say
yes,
in
this
case
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
establish
probable
cause.
and
ironically,
most
of
those
cases
were
warrantless
searches.
here,
the
police
officers
established
all
sorts
of
corroboration
and
then
went
before
a
judge
and
the
judge
was
convinced
there
was
enough
to
establish
probable
cause.
and
we
think
that
that
ought
to
be
given
due
deference
by
this
court.
whatever
time
i
have
remaining
i'd
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
very
briefly,
your
honor.
to
clarify
what
mr.
justice
stevens
and
mr.
justice
white
asked
me
when
i
was
up
the
last
time,
that
is,
we
agree
with
nathanson
that
the
conclusory
assertion
standing
alone
of
criminal
activity
is
not
enough.
but
here,
as
i've
pointed
out,
there's
been
much
more
than
that.
the
type
of
detail
that
is
in
this
letter,
indicating
specifically
that
susan
gates
would
leave
on
may
3rd,
that
lance
gates
would
leave
a
couple
days
later,
which
proved
to
be
true,
indicated
that
the
information
had
to
come
from
somebody
who
was
intimately
connected
with
this
criminal
enterprise,
as
this
court
said
in
spinelli.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
in
that
instance
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
that's
true,
that
susan
gates
apparently
came
back
with
lance.
but
there
was
only
a
two-day
stretch
that
the
apartment
was
left
unattended--
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
--if
that
theory
is
accepted,
yes.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
it
appears
that
that's
the
way--
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
--i
think
you've
got
to
look,
as
i
said
earlier,
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
i
would
have
difficulties
entering
the
apartment,
because
the
veracity
of
the
informant
has
not
been
shown,
because
there
are
oranges
in
the
car.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
i'm
simply
saying
that
there
was
more
evidence
for
the
automobile
than
there
was
for
the
apartment.
mr.
paul
b.
biebel
jr.
i
am
taking
the
position
it
was
enough
to
enter
the
apartment.
