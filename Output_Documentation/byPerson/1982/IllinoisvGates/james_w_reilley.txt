mr.
james
w.
reilley
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
question
of
whether
the
search
warrant
naming
the
defendants,
their
home
and
an
automobile,
based
upon
an
anonymous
letter
and
absent
any
exigent
circumstances,
with
no
police
observations
of
any
criminal
activity,
informed
the
issuing
magistrate
of
some
of
the
underlying
circumstances
from
which
the
anonymous
tipster
concluded
that
the
narcotics
were
where
he
or
she
claimed
they
were,
and
some
of
the
underlying
circumstances
from
which
the
magistrate
could
have
concluded
that
the
tipster,
whose
identity
was
unknown,
was
credible
or
his
information
reliable.
i
start
off,
if
i
may,
with
that
statement
and
couch
it
in
the
terms
of
the
aguilar
case
because
i
believe
in
our
opinion,
our
feelings
and
our
theory
from
the
trial
court
up
until
today
have
been
the
same.
we
have
read
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
aguilar
and
spinelli.
we
have
postulated
them
to
both
the
trial
judge,
the
illinois
appellate
court
and
the
illinois
supreme
court.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
yes,
your
honor,
i
intend
to
discuss
draper
and
compare
it
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor.
the
test,
as
i
have
indicated--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does
provide
an
alternative
approach,
if
i
may,
with
regard
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
as
stated
in
spinelli,
draper
was
a
suitable
benchmark
for
a
comparison
in
terms
of
the
two-pronged
or
two-basis
test.
in
draper,
however,
we
had,
as
the
court
stated,
a
reliable
informant
with
a
past
track
record,
compared
to
the
gates
case,
there
was
an
anonymous
letter
which
i
described
as
written
in
the
third
person.
the
letter
writer
stated
facts
and
conclusions,
talked
about
the
trip
to
florida
on
may
3rd
by
mrs.
gates,
talked
about
him
flying
down,
and
was
incorrect
in
terms
of
the
corroboration
that
my
opponent
suggests
because
the
letter
writer,
the
anonymous
tipster,
said
she
would
fly
down...
or
drive
down,
rather,
leave
the
car
to
be
loaded
with
drugs
and
fly
back
immediately.
when
the
police,
the
dea,
watched
susan
gates
into
the
room,
they
saw
her
get
into
the
car
with
mr.
gates
the
next
morning,
contrary
to
what
the
letter
writer
said.
the
letter
write
said
she'd
leave
the
car
and
fly
back
immediately;
contrary
to
that,
she
got
in
the
car.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
i
believe,
if
i
recall,
your
honor,
he
said
that
draper
would
be
returning
to
denver
on
either
september
8th
or
9th
in
that
case,
and
it
was,
in
fact,
the
9th.
i
believe
he
gave
an
alternative
date.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
yes,
he
did.
and
he
did
describe
the
physical
description
of
draper.
in
addition,
the
informant,
whose
name
was
hereford,
was
named
by
the
court,
by
the
officer
in
his
testimony.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
is
your
question
that
we
now
find
the
person
who
wrote
the
letter?
mr.
james
w.
reilley
and
we're
trying
to
back
up
what
he
said
by
what
was
said
in
the
letter?
mr.
james
w.
reilley
no,
sir,
i
would
have
to
say
not,
only
based
upon
the
content
of
the
letter.
the
letter
itself
does
not
express
where
the
letter
writer...
even
if
we
know
who
it
is...
obtained
his
information.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
specifically
this.
that
this
court
has
said
that
the
probable
cause
standard
for
a
search
warrant,
now,
for
a
search
warrant
as
opposed
to
an
emergency
on
the
street
as
in
adams
versus
williams
where
there
was
perhaps
a
danger
to
the
police
officer
or
to
society
because
of
a
gun.
specifically,
this
court
said
that
hearsay
can
now
be
the
basis
for
a
search
warrant,
as
opposed
to
the
direct
observations
of
an
officer.
in
addition,
the
fourth
amendment
commands
require
that
a
magistrate
be
neutral
and
detached
and
not
be
a
rubber
stamp
for
the
police.
so
keeping
that
as
the
guideline
that
we're
going
to
use
hearsay
and
not
direct
observations
of
the
swearing
police
officer
who
stands
before
the
magistrate,
there
must
be
some
guideline
or
some
test
to
protect
the
citizens
and
their
fourth
amendment
rights
from
unreasonable
searches
and,
of
course,
the
police
to
ferret
out
crime.
keeping
that
as
the
basis,
your
honor,
my
answer
to
your
question
is
no,
this
does
not
establish
probable
cause
because
the
judge
who
signed
the
search
warrant
had
absolutely
no
way
to
know
whether
the
letter
writer
had
a
grudge,
picked
up
this
information
in
a
neighborhood
bar,
as
this
court
has
said
on
occasions,
gossip
in
the
underworld,
that
type
of
conversation.
i
believe
in
the
spinelli--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--yes,
sir,
that's
true,
but
there
is
a
way
to
find
out
if
there's
any
way
to
credit
that
hearsay,
and
this
court
has
enunciated
that;
with
either
the
past
track
record
of
reliability
or
as
in
harris,
a
statement
against
one's
penal
interest
to
add
some
reliability
to
it.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
anonymous
tips
do
have
a
place
in
criminal
law
and
in
crime
prevention.
i
certainly
do
not
say
that
they
do
not
have
a
place.
however,
i
will
say
that
the
anonymous
tip
in
this
case,
even
with
the
corroboration,
contrary
to
my
opponent's
view,
i
do
believe
that
this
court
has
stated
that
the
corroboration
of
what
an
anonymous
person
says,
or
what
a
reliable
says,
the
corroboration
itself
cannot
give
the
court
or
the
issuing
magistrate
the
ability
to
find
out
where
he
found
that
information
out.
whether
he
heard
it...
corroboration,
or
even
a
reliable
informant
could
fabricate
out
of
the
whole
cloth,
as
this
court
stated.
could
lie
in
detail
or
lie
generally.
so
we
don't
know
just
by
corroboration
of
facts
subsequently...
in
fact,
if
we
use
the
corroboration
approach
of
my
opponent,
the
corroboration
was
not
specifically
as
the
letter
stated.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
letter
writer
did
not
give
the
specific
address
of
the
gates's;
he
gave
no
physical
description...
he
or
she
gave
no
physical--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--the
initial
address
of
the
gates's
was
not
stated,
your
honor,
in
the
letter.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
no,
i'm
sorry,
maybe
i
misunderstood
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
letter
writer,
the
anonymous
tipster,
did
not,
in
his
letter
to
the
bloomingdale
police
department
give
an
address
for
the
gates's.
he
said...
he
gave
a
location.
on
greenway
in
the
condominiums
in
bloomingdale.
the
affidavit
and
the
verification
of
the
officer
found
three
separate
addresses
which
are
stated
in
the
complaint.
the
first
one
was
through
the
secretary
of
state.
that's
the
one
i
believe
your
honor
is
referring
to...
209
darthmouth.
the
confidential
informant
who
is
referred
to
who
reviewed
some
financial
records...
we
do
not
know,
of
course,
what
financial
records
he
reviewed,
where
he
obtained
them,
whether
they
were
his
or
someone
else's...
gave
198
greenway
drive.
but
yet,
when
the
officer
checked
with
the
airlines
to
determine
that
gates
was
boarding
a
flight,
he
got
a
phone
number
and
the
illinois
bell
telephone
company
gave
yet
a
third
address...
if
you
read
it
carefully,
it's
189
greenway
drive.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
to
the
ultimate
fact?
is
the
question
of
where
the
specific
information
comes
from
to
enable
the
magistrate
to,
himself
as
opposed
to
rubber
stamping
someone
else's
opinion...
himself
determine
from
the
raw
facts
if
probable
cause
exists.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
my
answer
is
this.
that
the
anonymous
letter
writer
is...
the
fact
that
we
don't
know
where
that
information
came
from
is
the
critical
fact.
we
don't
know
the
basis
of
the
knowledge.
if
you're
going
to
say
the
question
of
a
brown
versus
a
red
jacket,
i
think
we'll
have
to
go
back
to
draper,
your
honor,
and
discuss
the...
in
draper,
although
a
previously
reliable
informant
giving,
let's
say,
10
facts,
9
out
of
10
prove
true
by
corroboration,
therefore,
the
syllogism
would
go
to
the
test,
therefore
the
drugs
are
present.
however,
i
believe
this
court
in
spinelli
said
that
draper
presumed
a
reliable
informant
giving
that
information.
here
we
have
an
anonymous
person.
we
do
not
know
the
motive,
we
don't
know
who
the
person
is--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--i
believe
in
assessing
the
credibility
of
the
writer
and
the
source
of
his
information.
we
don't
know
if
he
heard
it,
if
he
saw
it
himself,
if
he
was
in
the
gates's
home
or
if
somebody
passed
this
rumor
on
three
times
removed
from
the
author
of
the
letter.
and
i
believe
that's
critical
because
we're
talking
about
going
into
someone's
house
with
a
search
warrant
to
search
that
person's
house.
perhaps
in
this
case
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
the
police
got
lucky,
and
we
can't
justify
what
the
legality
of
the
search
warrant
by
what
it
produced.
if
nine
out
of
ten
times
an
anonymous
letter
writer
might
be
speaking
out
of
hearsay,
rumor
or
gossip
and
the
facts
would
became
untrue
and
they
could
search
anyone
in
this
courtroom's
home
and
find
nothing,
i
believe
this
court
would
not
tolerate
a
standard
based
on
anonymity
as
the
basis
for
a
search
warrant
without
something
more.
again,
i
don't
say
that
anonymous
tipsters
do
not
have
a
part
in
criminal
law;
they
certainly
do.
i
believe
the
police,
however,
are
obliged
to
take
the
information
and
do
something
more
with
it
in
order
to
establish
criminality.
there
is
nothing
in
this
search
warrant
that
establishes
any
criminal
conduct.
our
supreme
court
viewed
it...
the
appellate
court
reviewed
it
and
the
trial
judge
viewed
it
as
corroborating
innocent
activities,
even
in
view
of
the
letter.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
that
fact
in
and
of
itself,
your
honor,
is
innocent
activity.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
yes,
we
did.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
the
license
plate
was
listed
to
lance
gates.
it
was,
in
fact,
on
a
red
hornet
instead
of
a
mercury
vehicle.
however,
we
have
this
fact:
mr.
gates
traveled...
to
use
the
example
of
perhaps
the
profile
type
cases...
mr.
gates
traveled
to
florida
under
his
own
name.
this
was
not
a
typical
drug
courier
profile.
if
he
was
going
to
travel
down
there
to
bring
$100,000
worth
of
drugs
back,
he
certainly
would
think
to
use
a
phony
name
on
an
airline
ticket.
that
he
apparently
didn't
do
because
the
police
officer
saw
that
he
used
his
own
name.
his
wife
registered
under
her
own
name
in
the
hotel
in
florida.
that
is
inconsistent.
i
believe,
in
answer
directly
to
your
question,
that
the
license
plate
perhaps
could
be
an
oversight
in
terms
of...
or
perhaps
the
secretary
of
state's
office
didn't
get
the
transfer
in
time.
the
license
plate
would
be
placed
on
another
vehicle
if
one
was
sold
and
one
was
purchased,
and
maybe
the
computers
didn't
catch
up
to
the
file.
we
can't
assume
on
that
theory
that
that's
criminal
activity.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
i
would
say
if
that
were
true,
that
could
be
an
element
that
the
court
could
consider
in
determining
some
criminal
activity
or
some
means
of
attempting
to
hide
something.
nothing
that
was
done
here
was
done
in
any
circuitous
fashion
or
in
an
attempt
to
hide
from
or
evade
the
police.
whether
he
knew
he
was
being
observed
or
not
is
not
the
point.
even
drug
couriers
may
or
may
not
feel
they're
being
followed,
but
they
certainly
come
in
and
they
use
different
names
on
their
airline
tickets
which
is
part
of
the
profile
that
this
court
is
considering.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
yes,
sir,
that
is--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--i
guess
my
response,
your
honor,
was
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
license
plate
and
regarding
whether
that
fact
meant
anything.
and
in
response
to
that
i
was
talking
about
the
fact
that
his
own
name
was
apparently
used,
since
that's
what
the
affidavit
seems
to
indicate.
but
i
fail
to
see,
in
reading
the
affidavit,
what
if
any
of
those
facts,
taken
either
together
or
separately,
corroborates
any
criminality.
the
question
that
something
may
or
may
not
be
unusual,
we
don't
know
if
mr.
gates
was
having
an
argument
with
his
wife
and
went
down
and
they
made
up
and
he
drove
back.
it
certainly
does
not
reflect
the
statements
in
the
anonymous
letter
which
would
be
typical
if
that's
true,
that
she
would
drive
down,
leave
the
car
to
be
loaded
with
drugs
and
get
out
of
there.
and
that
he
would
drive
it
back
alone.
that's
not
what
occurred.
so
the
letter
was
not
corroborated
in
that
specific
and
important
detail.
if
we
can
assume
from
the
letter
that
that
would
be
the
profile
of
a
drug
courier,
then
we
can
take
the
converse
and
say
that
since
they
drove
back
together
that
the
car
was
not
loaded
with
drugs.
and
she
did
not
follow
what
the
anonymous
tipster,
from
whatever
his
source
of
information,
stated.
and
those
were
the
facts
which
were
not
corroborated,
contrary
to
draper
where
every
single
fact
was
corroborated
including
the
alternative
date
of
arrival.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
no,
sir,
i'm
not.
if
i
may,
an
anonymous
tip
could
play
a
part,
for
example,
in
an
emergency
situation
on
the
street.
for
example,
in
chicago
we
have
a
situation
now
with
tylenol.
and
anonymous
tip
calls
are
coming
in
constantly.
the
police
must
follow
up
on
those
calls
to
determine
the
source
of
the
cyanide.
however,
they
can't
break
into
someone's
house
with
or
without
a
search
warrant
based
upon
an
anonymous
phone
call
that
says,
for
example,
there
was
one
in
the
paper
that
said
the
plo
was
responsible.
there's
no
way
that
that
tip
can
support
probable
cause
under
the
standards
of
this
court.
but
the
police
can
certainly
follow
up
with
investigative
procedures.
this
is
a
computer
world;
they
have
many
things
available
to
them
to
substantiate
criminal
activity
if
it
exists.
if
they
can't
substantiate
criminal
activity
under
the
standards
this
court
has
stated,
then
they
simply
can't
search.
it
doesn't
arise
to
probable
cause.
that
doesn't
mean
that
anonymous
tips
are
not
important.
they
certainly
are.
they
can
be
a
beginning
point
for
something,
but
i
don't
think
they,
in
and
of
themselves,
and
substantiated
only
by
innocent
activity
at
best,
can
amount
to
probable
cause
in
the
way
this
court
has
described
it.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
no,
i
do
not.
under
the
present
standards
of
this
court--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--no,
i
do
not.
and
the
reason,
if
i
may
be
specific
as
to
my
response
to
you,
is
this.
even
the
detail
of
the
tip...
the
detail
might
establish,
might
establish
some
degree
of
basis
of
knowledge.
and
i
cite
specifically
spinelli
for
that
proposition.
if
the
detail
is--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--yes.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
that's
right,
that
is
correct.
however,
if
the
tip
that
your
honor
suggests
is
anonymous,
then
the
spinelli
and
aguilar
holdings
would
say
that
there's
something
missing,
however.
the
veracity
of
the
speaker.
again,
the
testing...
the
hearsay--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--if,
in
fact,
the
details
could
be
corroborated.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
no,
i
do
believe
that
corroboration
can
establish
one
aspect
of
the
two-pronged
test;
namely,
the
veracity
standard.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
however,
i
don't
believe
that
applies
to
this
case.
the
theory
does
but
the
facts
do
not.
and
specifically,
the
facts
that
were
educed
in
this
letter
were
not
and
did
not
come
close
to
draper.
there
were
substantial
differences
between
that
letter
writer
and
draper,
in
addition,
of
course,
to
the
fact
that
draper
was
an
anonymous
informant.
but
taking
your
honor's
suggestions,
i
agree
with
the
theory,
yes.
the
letter
does
not
approach
draper
and
the
detail
was
not
sufficient
enough
to
give
some
characterization
to
it
as
a
reliable
basis
of
knowledge.
the
corroboration,
on
the
other
hand,
in
terms
of
the
veracity
prong,
was
also
not
sufficient
because
the
corroboration,
although
innocent
detail
was
corroborated
in
draper,
was
not
totally
corroborated.
there
were
some
errors;
there
were
some
things
that
were
not
correct.
so
if
you're
taking...
and
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
look
seriously
and
closer
at
an
anonymous
tip
than
it
would
at
a
confidential
police
informant.
and
i
think
in
a
case
like
this,
you
can
use
those
theories
but
i
think
they
have
to
be
very
carefully
analyzed
because
we're
talking
about
a
fourth
amendment
right.
and
admittedly,
they
may
apply
but
not
in
this
fact
situation.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
i
think
the
answer
is
this,
your
honor.
that
the
anonymous
tip,
we
don't
know
what
provokes
or
suggests
him
to
become
anonymous
and
write
the
letter.
why
would
he
want
to
remain
anonymous?
if
he
knew
that,
perhaps
i
could
answer
your
question.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
but
then
maybe
again,
he
is
a
jealous
drug
smuggler
who
wants
to
take
revenge
on
another
drug
smuggler,
so
he
writes
letters
to
the
police
department.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
because
here
we
have...
with
a
police
informant
at
least
we
can,
number
one,
we
can
establish
a
real,
live
human
being,
a
body,
who
is
standing
there
either
before
the
magistrate
or
at
least
with
the
police
officer.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
okay.
he's
standing
with
the
police
officer.
the
police
officer
knows
who
he
is.
admittedly,
he's
involved
in
criminal
conduct
of
some
sort,
but
assuming
the
typical
police
informant
with
a
track
record,
despite
his
conduct
in
society
which
we
don't
condone,
the
fact
is
he
has
given
information
before
and
it's
proven
to
be
accurate.
so
although
there
is
a
standard
to
look
at
him
closely
because
of
the
nature
of
who
he
is,
we
still
can
establish
a
track
record
of
his
reliability
in
the
past.
whereas
with
an
anonymous
person,
for
whatever
his
motives
may
be,
good
or
bad
or
a
desire
to
live
or
a
jealous
drug
smuggler,
we
don't
know
what
those
motives
are.
therefore,
we
can't
make
any
judgment
about
him
because
we
don't
have
him
standing
before
the
officer
who
can
also
make
a
judgment.
he's
anonymous;
we
have
no
basis
to
know
it.
and
we're
talking
about
that
information
being
supportive
for
a
search
warrant.
and
i
believe
that
that
type
of
information
cannot
get
over
the
hurdle
without
more.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
over
the
fourth
amendment
hurdle,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
to
amount
to
probable
cause.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
i
base
it
on
aguilar
and
jones,
and
i
base
it
on
spinelli
and
draper.
i
base
it
on
a
combination,
and
i
also
would
cite
harris.
the
whole
line
of
cases
in
terms
of
the
problems
this
court
has
discussed
in
terms
of
what's
missing
in
a
search
warrant
and
how
to
cure
it.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
no,
i
really
don't
think
so,
unless
you're
going
to
have
a
search
warrant
only
based
upon
the--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--it
can
be
spun
out
only
with
a
little
analysis,
a
simple
analysis,
of
two
aspects,
and
i
don't
believe
the
fourth
amendment
alone
can
do
that.
we
need
a
little
extra
language
to
assist
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
talk
about
basis
of
knowledge
and
veracity.
but
the
fourth
amendment
perhaps
didn't
contemplate
hearsay
informants
as
the
basis
for
a
search
warrant,
either.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
i
can
only
assume
that.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
because
the
language
doesn't
seem
to
indicate
that.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
i
can
answer
your
question
this
way,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
if
the
second
letter
is
written
in
the
third
person
as
the
first
one
is,
the
answer
to
the
first
part
of
your
question
is
no,
because
even
if
the
question
you
postulate
substantiates
some
kind
of
reliability,
if
the
letter
is
written
as
this
one
was...
and
i
would
have
to
presume
in
your
fact
setting
that
it
is...
it
still
doesn't
establish
how
the
letter
writer
knew
what
he
said.
whether
he
heard
it...
i'm
only
using
this
court's
analysis
of
barroom
gossip
and
rumor.
we
have
tried
to
follow
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
terms
of
what
that
means.
why
was
there
a
necessity
for
basis
of
knowledge.
why
was
there
a
necessity
for
reliability?
in
your
case,
your
honor,
there
would
not
be
a
basis
of
knowledge
because
the
party
is
speaking
in
the
third
person,
not
reiterating
raw
data,
something
he
saw
or
heard
or
smelled.
and
the
court
has
been
consistent
in
that
regard,
and
we
feel
that
this
fact
situation
cannot
be
supported
and
does
not
support
probable
cause
based
upon
that
analysis.
it
simply
doesn't
state
how
the
person
came
to
his
knowledge.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
i
suppose
that
second
case
we'd
be
back
here
again
discussing
it.
[laughter]
i
would
have
to
say,
your
honor,
in
all
fairness
and
in
all
candor
that
that
sounds
to
me
like
it's
bordering
on
reliability.
but
i
still
cannot
state
to
you
in
response
to
your
question
that
that
would
do
anything
to
establish
the
basis
of
the
knowledge
that
the
letter
writer
is
talking
about.
maybe
you
can
get
lucky
twice.
if
he
doesn't
say
how
he
knew
it
under
the
standards
of
this
court,
then
that's
not
sufficient.
unless,
of
course,
the
detail
is
verified
under
the
spinelli
rationale.
and
i
fully
agree,
as
justice
o'connor
asked
me,
that
theory
is
viable
and
i
believe
that
that
is
correct.
but
under
the
postulate
that
the
court
has,
i
don't
believe
that's
proper.
it's
still
anonymous.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
do
i
see
anything
unusual
about
it?
mr.
james
w.
reilley
your
honor,
my
answer
to
your
question,
without
being
facetious,
is
that
it
was
may
in
chicago
and
the
weather
was
warm
up
north,
also.
certainly,
it
might
arouse
some
suspicions
but
i
can't
say
that
that
fact
in
and
of
itself
is
criminality.
and
i
do
not
concede
that
it
does.
what
one
does
that
is
innocent
and
what
someone
else
would
do,
you
can't...
just
because
i
would
do
it
different
than
your
honor
might
do
it
or
someone
else
might
do
it
doesn't
necessarily
make
it
criminal.
maybe...
who
knows
what
the
reasons
for
it,
but
if
there
were
several
options
available,
if
there
were
several
choices
we
can't
say
well,
let's
pick
the
criminal
choice
because
that's
the
one
we
want
to
pick
because
the
letter
writer
said
there
are
drugs
there.
if
there
are
five
options
we
can't
just
pick
one.
there
must
be
some
basis
to
pick
it.
that
would
be
my
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
you
may
not.
unless--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--no.
let
me
again...
you
may
not,
except
if
you
file
a
form
with
the
secretary
of
state's
office
transferring
the
plate
from
car
a
to
car
b,
the
same
plate
is
transferred
and
the
form
goes
to
springfield
and
registers
that
plate
to
a
new
vehicle.
that
is
proper,
and
you
can
do
that.
and
you
can
put
it
on
the
car
with
a
tag
showing
that
the
registration
has
been
transferred,
and
the
computer
will
catch
up
to
it
whenever
that
happens.
that
is
perfectly
valid
and
legal.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
there
was
no
hearing,
your
honor,
at
the
trial
court.
it
was
strictly
an
evidentiary,
legal
argument.
the
record
is
blank
as
to
that
information.
the
only
statement
is
in
the
affidavit
stating
that
the
plate
itself
was
registered
on
may
3,
1978,
to
a
different
car.
that's
the
only
thing
in
the
record.
there
is
nothing
beyond
that.
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
saying
that
i
feel
that
under
the
analysis
this
court
has
prescribed,
which
we
have
attempted
to
follow,
and
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
lack
of
facts
in
the
letter,
certainly
the
police
did
what
they
could
have
done,
but
it
certainly
was
not
enough
in
order
to
make
this
case
probable
cause.
what
they
found
cannot
justify
the
existence
of
what
i
believe
still
to
be
the
viable
two-sided
test
of
aguilar:
a
basis
for
the
knowledge
of
the
speaker,
and
a
basis
for
the
credibility
of
the
person
or
the
reliability
of
the
information.
it's
my
belief
that
you
can't
cross
one
to
the
other,
that
self-verifying
detail
can
only
assist,
as
this
court
said
in
spinelli,
in
basis
of
knowledge.
as
in
draper,
corroboration
can
only
attempt
to
cure
the
veracity
or
truthfulness
test.
i
believe
both
of
them
are
lacking,
and
i
would
ask
this
court
respectfully
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
good
afternoon,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
any
decision
by
this
court,
directed
at
the
question
asked
of
us
on
november
29,
to
modify
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
can
have
no
effect
on
the
illinois
statutory
exclusionary
rule
which
constitutes
inadequate
and
independent
state
ground
for
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
approximately--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--i
believe
that
at
that
time
the
issued
was
not
raised,
mr.
chief
justice,
therefore,
it
was
kind
of
not...
unnecessary
for
the
court
to
even
mention
something
that
was
so
obvious.
the
statute
that
i
referred
to
was
adopted
twenty
years
ago
and
is
included
in
the
appendix
to
our
original
brief,
appendix
1a,
and
incorporated
by
reference
into
our
brief
on
reargument.
if
i
may
briefly
read
the
pertinent
parts
of
that
statute
to
the
court.
it
is
entitled,
motion
to
suppress
evidence
illegally
seized.
and
it
reads
briefly
as
follows.
a
defendant
aggrieved
by
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure
may
move
the
court
to
suppress
as
evidence
anything
so
obtained
on
the
ground
that
the
search
and
seizure
with
a
warrant
was
illegal,
because
the
warrant
is
insufficient
on
its
face
or
there
was
not
probable
cause
for
the
issuance
of
the
warrant.
it
goes
further
and
substantively
states
if
the
motion
is
granted
the
property
shall
not
be
admissable
in
evidence
against
the
movant
at
any
trial.
there
is
a
further
part
of
that
statute
which
requires
the
motion
to
be
made
only
before
a
court
with
jurisdiction
to
try
the
offense.
in
illinois,
that
would
be
a
full
circuit
court
judge
in
a
felony
situation.
and
it
requires
further
that
the
judge
who
enters
the
order
make
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
so
that
the
order
and
judgment
may
be
reviewed
by
a
higher
court.
based
upon
the
statute,
the
trial
courts
in
illinois
must
test
the
facial
sufficiency
of
search
warrants
against
a
probable
cause
standard
and
nothing
less.
the
statute
allows
in
a
brief
party
to
make
a
motion
contesting
a
warrant's
validity
to
a
trial
court
in
an
adversary
setting.
it
commands
that
if
the
motion
is
granted
that
the
evidence
shall
not
be
admissable
against
the
defendant
at
a
trial.
the
illinois
appellant
courts
in
construing
this
statute
have
viewed
it
as
giving
a
defendant
the
right
to
move
the
court
to
suppress
unlawfully
seized
evidence
and
recognizes
this
statute
as
the
basis
for
pre-trial
motions
to
suppress
in
illinois.
the
case
that
indicates
that
is
in
an
appellant
court
opinion,
people
versus
lebon,
at
299
northeast
2nd
336.
the
illinois
supreme
court,
in
the
opinion
by
justice
schafer,
has
recognized
this
statute
as
the
codification
of
the
exclusionary
rule
first
announced
in
people
versus
brocamp
which
was
mentioned
by
i
believe
mr.
biebel.
the
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
1923,
nine
years
after
weeks
and
forty
years
before
mapp
and
as
such
is
the
statutory
exclusionary
rule
in
illinois
as
was
indicated
in
brocamp.
that
case
was
people
versus
vanderalston
at
349
northeast
2nd,
page
16,
a
1976
opinion.
the
illinois
appellant
courts
in
construing
this
statute
have
stated
that
this
statute
necessarily
implies
that
the
hearing
judge
has
the
authority
to
overturn
the
finding
of
the
issuing
judge
on
the
probable
cause
question.
that
case
indicating
that
is
people
v.
martin
which
is
cited
in
our
original
brief
on
page
25.
there's
a
substantial
quote
from
martin
in
that
particular
page.
and
that
such
a
review
over
the
issuing
judge's
decision
to
issue
the
warrant
is
necessarily
proper
and
necessary.
a
case
construing
that
is
people
v.
tatman
in
1980,
again
an
appellant
court
decision
of
406
northeast
2nd,
page
619.
further,
on
reviewing
a
trial
court's
ruling
on
a
motion
to
suppress
illegally
seized
evidence
the
appellant
court
now
reviewing
the
trial
court's
determination
has
a
duty
to
affirm
the
trial
court's
decision
unless
the
decision
is
manifestly
erroneous.
that
decision
is
people
v.
smithers
at
394
northeast
2nd,
590,
in
1979,
illinois
public
case.
petitioner
urges
this
court
to
adopt
the
standard
such
that
if
the
issuing
magistrate
made
a
mistake
in
his
determination
of
probable
cause,
the
evidence
seized
pursuant
to
the
warrant
should
nevertheless
be
admissable.
petitioner
is
thus
requesting
this
court,
not
the
illinois
supreme
court
when
they
argued
there,
to
ignore
the
illinois
constitution,
to
ignore
the
illinois
statute
and
to
ignore
the
illinois
supreme
court's
opinion
in
brocamp
60
years
ago.
further,
petitioner's
suggestion
that
search
warrants
deficient
on
their
face
should
not
be
overturned
flies
in
the
face
of
this
court's
language
in
franks
v.
delaware
in
dealing
with
the
ex
parte
nature
of
the
warrant
process
itself
this
court
and
the
dissent
even
indicated
that
it
makes
a
good
deal
of
sense
to
review
search
warrants
issued
by
magistrates
because
of
the
ex
parte
nature
and
also
because
of
chadwick
v.
city
of
tampa.
magistrates
need
not
be
trained
lawyers.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
i
think
a
police
officer
has
no
choice
once
the
warrant
is
issued
because
the
warrant's
language
commands
that
the
officer
shall
search
the
person
and
place
named.
i
don't
believe
he
has
any
discretion
at
that
point.
if
he
feels
the
warrant's
invalid
his
feeling
is
irrelevant
at
that
point
since
the
magistrate
already
signed
it
and
he
is,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
obligated,
i
believe,
to
follow
the
signature
of
that
search
warrant
because
it
commands
him
to
do
so.
prior
to,
as
i
indicated
earlier...
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
statutory
exclusionary
rule
in
illinois
the
supreme
court
adopted
the
exclusionary
rule
nine
years
after
weeks
in
brocamp,
again
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
the
brocamp
decision
was
followed
by
many
others
including
peoples
v.
castree
which
is
cited
in
this
court's
appendix
in
the
elkins
decision.
at
that
time
there
was
a
reference
to
cases
that
states
that
excluded
and
did
not
exclude
evidence
both
before
and
after
wolf
and
before
and
after
weeks.
because
of
the
illinois
exclusionary
rules
independent
and
prior
existence
to
this
court's
decision
in
mapp
v.
ohio,
the
question
of
whether
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
should
to
any
extent
be
modified
in
this
case
makes
any
such
decision
advisory
because
such
a
decision
would
have
no
effect
on
the
statutorily
and
judicially
mandated
requirement
in
the
state
of
illinois
that
evidence
seized
without
probable
cause
be
excluded
based
upon
the
constitutional
language
which
tracks
the
fourth
amendment,
the
statutory
language
and
the
decisions.
in
summary,
any
modification
of
the
rule
can
have
no
effect
on
the
illinois
constitutionally
judicially
declared
and
legislatively
enacted
exclusionary
rule.
this
court
in
cooper
v.
california
made
the
statement
which
i
feel
is
appropriate
with
regard
to
this
state
ground
argument.
a
decision
by
this
court,
of
course,
does
not
affect
the
state's
power
to
impose
higher
standards
on
searches
and
seizures
than
required
by
the
federal
constitution
if
it
chooses
to
do
so.
considering
this
jurisdictional
question,
i
also
urge
the
court
to
read
that
portion
of
the
brief
submitted
by
the
state
public
defender
of
california
and
the
national
association
of
criminal
defense
lawyers
dealing
with
28
united
states
code
1257,
certiorari
jurisdiction
only
to
the
extent
that
the
language
indicates
that
the
court
will
entertain
a
question
over
the
rights
or
privileges
which
are
specially
set
up
in
a
state
court.
it's
the
respondent's
contention
that
the
state
of
illinois
never
raised
this
question
at
any
level
in
the
state
proceedings.
that
the
state
of
illinois
is
or
should
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
has
been
an
exclusionary
rule
in
the
state
of
illinois
for
60
years.
that
a
judge
has
no
choice
if
he
finds
no
probable
cause,
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
illinois
he
must
suppress
the
evidence.
there
is
no
good
faith
or
reasonable
belief
exception.
the
statute
is
very
clear
on
its
face
and
we
believe,
the
respondents
believe,
that
the
statute
controls
in
this
case.
the
petitioner's
brief
tells
this
court,
as
i
believe
counsel
indicated,
that
they're
not
asking
for
a
good
faith
exception.
they
agree
that
the
exclusionary
rule
should
apply
if
the
mistake
is
a
question
of
law.
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
the
determination
of
the
existence
or
not
of
probable
cause
is
a
question
of
law.
certainly,
it
may
be
a
mixture
in
that
you
have
to
look
at
facts,
you
have
to
look
sometimes
at
hearsay
declarations,
but
all
in
all
the
determination
of
the
existence
or
not
of
probable
cause
is
a
question
of
law.
so
therefore,
under
counsel's
own
statement
in
his
brief,
if
that
is
true
then
the
exclusionary
rule
should
apply.
counsel
indicates
that
he
believes
that
the
exclusionary
rule
or
the
question
of
probable
cause
is
a
question
of
fact.
certainly,
that
cannot
be
true.
if
you
look
at
franks
v.
delaware,
again
you
look
the
language
of
this
court,
seen
in
deciding
that
franks
should
now
apply
a
principle
of
going
behind
the
search
warrant
getting
to
the
integrity
of
the
statements
made
to
determine
if
there's
an
intentional
or
reckless
misstatement.
the
court
in
the
majority
opinion
discuss
the
fact
that
there
is
no
difference
between
looking
at
the
sufficiency
or
facial
sufficiency
of
the
search
warrant
or
to
go
behind
the
warrant
and
determine
if
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
integrity
of
the
warrant.
in
other
words,
the
exclusionary
rule
should
apply
in
both
circumstances.
the
case
that
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
people
v.
martin,
which
was
cited
in
the
respondents'
original
brief
at
page
25,
is
important
for
another
reason.
the
other
reason
is
that
apparently
the
state
of
illinois
in
that
decision
tried
to
do
in
the
state
court
what
the
petitioner
is
now
trying
to
do
in
this
court.
and
i
believe
the
language
is
appropriate
to
repeat
at
this
point.
the
substance
of
the
state's
argument
on
appeal
is
that
judge
stiegment's
finding
that
probable
cause
to
issue
the
warrant
did
not
exist,
was
merely
a
substitution
of
his
views
for
the
findings
previously
made
by
judge
munsch
in
issuing
the
warrant.
the
state
would
have
us
rule
that
once
a
magistrate
issues
a
search
warrant
which
he
finds
to
be
based
on
probable
cause
another
trial
judge
may
not
overturn
that
decision
in
ruling
on
a
motion
to
suppress.
the
illinois
appellant
court
stated
then,
we
cannot
agree
with
the
state's
argument.
such
a
holding
would
immunize
the
reexamination
of
the
warrant
process
and
determine
the
ruling
upon
a
motion
to
suppress.
counsel
never
urged
that
in
the
illinois
courts.
he's
now
urging
this
court
perhaps
to
overrule
the
statutory
framework
that
all
judges
in
the
state
of
illinois
work
under.
that
is
very
simply
stated
a
standard
of
probable
cause
based
upon
the
judgements
of
reviewing
trial
judges
and
later
appellant
judges
reviewing
under
that
manifestly
erroneous
standard
that
the
court
has
adopted.
i
think
it's
important
to,
at
this
time,
look
at
the
question
that
is
really
before
this
court.
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
warrant
process.
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
situation,
such
as
hill
v.
california
where
an
officer
reasonably
thought
that
the
person
he
was
arresting
looked
remarkably
like
the
defendant
who
he
had
probable
cause
to
arrest.
we
are
dealing
with
a
very
delicate
fourth
amendment
warrant
requirement.
i
believe
it's
important
now
to
direct
certain
comments
to
that
issue.
the
fourth
amendment
talks
about
reasonableness.
the
fourth
amendment
has
a
warrant
clause
which
specifically
requires
that
probable
cause
be
the
standard,
that
the
warrant
be
signed
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate,
and
that
there
be
specificity
in
the
warrant.
by
definition,
a
search
warrant
issued
upon
less
than
probable
cause
is
per
say
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
to
permit
the
introduction
of
evidence
seized
pursuant
to
an
officer's
inaccurate
reasonable
belief
that
he
acted
in
compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment
would
establish
a
lesser
standard
than
probable
cause,
best
described
as
we
did
in
our
brief
a
reasonably
unreasonable
search.
the
fourth
amendment
standard
of
probable
cause
would
become
diluted
and
in
effect
would
become
whatever
the
officer
thought
it
was.
dunnaway
v.
new
york
spoke
to
the
question
of
probable
cause
and
indicated
there
was
a
long
history
of
testing
the
standard
of
probable
cause
against
the
standard
of
reasonableness
as
required
by
the
fourth
amendment.
dunnaway
also
said
that
the
exclusionary
rules
should
be
based
upon
an
objective
rather
than
a
subjective
test.
the
key
part
of
the
warrant
i
believe
is
reasonableness.
it
makes
no
sense
to
ask
that
an
exception
to
the
rule
be
adopted
when
the
word
reasonableness
is
already
included
in
the
fourth
amendment.
and
this
court
has,
with
regard
again
to
the
warrant
process,
has
dealt
with
the
question
of
reasonableness
in
cases
such
as
ventresca
in
which
the
court
will
give
more
credence
to
a
judge's
determination
which
has
been
upheld
upon
review
in
lower
courts.
and
allow
a
little
bit
of
leeway
because
we
all
understand
that
police
officers
are
not
legally
trained.
therefore,
the
warrant
process
has
already
a
built-in
degree
of
sway
between
left
and
right,
perhaps
five
degrees,
to
allow
that
reasonableness
to
already
apply.
again,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
warrant
process
is
ex
parte.
it
necessarily
implies
that
there
are
no
adversary
conversations
to
convince
or
not
the
magistrate
to
sign
or
not
sign
a
search
warrant.
common
sense
indicates
it
is
basically
a
police
officer
who
presents
the
search
warrant
to
the
issuing
magistrate,
and
it
is
based
upon
the
statements
of
the
police
officer
that
the
magistrate
makes
his
decision.
i
don't
believe
we
are
talking
about
the
good
faith
of
the
magistrate
when
we
talk
about
the
question
posed
by
this
court.
certainly,
the
magistrate
made
a
decision.
he
made
the
decision
based
upon
whatever
training
and
whatever
belief
he
had.
however,
the
purpose
for
the
review
process
under
the
illinois
statute
and
under
this
court's
determinations
in
aguilar
and
spinelli
is
to
determine
if
the
magistrate's
decision
to
sign
the
warrant
was
in
fact
consistent
with
the
standard
of
probable
cause
as
applied
to
search
warrants.
i
believe
the
question
was
asked
on
the
argument
of
my
opponents
whether
nathanson
should
be
overruled.
i
think,
consistent
with
the
argument
of
my
opponents,
this
court
should
therefore
overrule
aguilar
and
spinelli.
spinelli
was
a
gambling
case.
aguilar
was
a
drug
case.
there
was
nothing
egregious
about
that
type
of
situation.
based
upon
the
warrants
in
aguilar
and
nathanson
were
very
very
vague
and
did
not
describe
probable
cause
to
the
sufficient
standards
that
the
trial
court
and
the
appellant
court
and
this
court
thought
were
proper.
the
exclusionary
rule
in
search
warrant
cases
does
not
apply
merely
to
egregious
conduct.
it
applies
to
the
basic
statement
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
no
warrant
shall
issue
but
upon
probable
cause.
and,
if
this
court
or
a
reviewing
court
feels
there
is
no
probable
cause,
then
the
exclusionary
rule
applies.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
well,
this
court's
statements
as
you
indicated,
mr.
justice,
is
that
there
is
a
preference
for
search
warrants.
that
there
is
a
preference
for
the
police
officer
to
take
whatever
facts
unless
one
of
the
exceptions
applies,
for
example,
in
an
emergency
or
exigent
circumstances,
to
take
the
facts
to
a
magistrate,
have
the
magistrate
review
them
in
a
neutral
and
detached
fashion
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
officer
is
correct
in
his
opinion
at
that
time.
and
i
believe...
and,
of
course,
the
statements
of
the
officer
are
then
memorialized
on
the
four
corners
of
the
affidavit
in
support
of
the
search
warrant
so
that
a
reviewing
court
may
review
them
later.
i
agree
that
sometimes
warrants
may
not
be
necessary,
but
this
court
has
already
set
out
and
delineated
several
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
which
do
not
apply
in
a
circumstance
such
as
this
where
you're
talking
about
searching
a
home
and
searching
an
automobile.
but
an
automobile,
not
in
the
context
of
ross
or
changis
but
the
automobile
in
the
context
of
parked
on
the
driveway
somewhat
in
the
respect
of
coolidge,
because
of
the
way
the
facts
happened
in
this
case.
the
police
didn't
follow
that
car
back
from
florida.
they
waited
for
it
to
arrive
on
the
driveway
of
the
residence
of
the
gates'.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
yes,
i
have.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
it
has
happened
in
my
experience
on
several
occasions
when
i
myself
was
a
prosecutor
about
12
years
ago.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
well,
at
that
time
i
think
there
was
a
learning
process
of
the
standards
of
aguilar
and
spinelli
going
on
in
cook
county.
and
once
that
learning
process
developed
a
little
further
the
rate
became
less
and
less
because
everyone
was
kind
of
learning
together,
how
to
apply
it
in
the
narcotics
court
in
chicago.
so
yes,
there
was
that
degree
of
turning
away
by
judges
and
magistrates
who
were
familiar
with
the
standards
of
this
court.
i
believe
that
counsel's
argument
in
terms
of
this
search
warrant
is
asking
the
court
totally
to
overlook
what
you
said
in
aguilar
and
spinelli.
and
they
argued
the
first
time
that
this
court
should
overrule
those
standards.
but
now
they're
saying
that
if
the
magistrate
makes
a
reasonable
mistake
and
signs
the
warrant,
but
his
mistake
was
reasonable,
then
the
warrant
should
be
good.
they
are
totally
asking
this
court
to
avoid
review,
and
they're
totally
asking
this
court
to
avoid
what
is
consistent
with
the
jones
decision
of
saying
hearsay
can
be
the
basis
for
a
search
warrant.
they
are
forgetting
that
when
they
write
the
brief.
if
we're
going
to
use
the
direct
observations
of
a
police
officer,
then
we
can
dispense
with
the
requirements
of
aguilar
and
spinelli
to
a
degree.
but
if
you're
going
to
use
hearsay,
and
in
this
case
even
more
than
hearsay,
you're
using
a
letter,
the
substance
of
which
is
contained...
the
police
officers
do
not
know
who
the
writer
is.
the
normal
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant,
at
least
the
policeman
knows
who
it
is
and
he
can
establish
the
reliability
of
that
informant
by
various
statements
about
his
past
conduct.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
by
subsequent
to
the
search
warrant
being
signed?
the
only
thing
that
happened
subsequent,
if
i
recall
correctly,
is
that
once
the
car
left
west
palm
beach,
florida,
and
started
heading
in
a
northerly
direction,
the
only
other
event
that
took
place
was
that
23
hours
later
the
car
pulled
up
on
the
driveway.
there
was
nothing
else
observed
by
the
police.
they
ended
their
surveillance
in
florida
and
did
nothing
until
the
car
actually
arrived.
there
was
nothing
else
that
was
done.
i
assume
your
honor
is
not
referring
to
the
fact
that
they
stopped
them
and
then
they
opened
the
trunk
and
found
the
marijuana.
that,
of
course,
happened,
but
that
was
long
after
the
warrant
was
signed.
but
there
are
no
other
events
and
we
argued
before
and
we
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
that
the
activities
that
they
observed
were
innocent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
not
consistent
with
the
letter.
the
letter
writer
said
that
susan
gates
would
drop
the
car
off
and
fly
back
home.
lance
would
drive
it
back
by
himself.
well,
that
did
not
happen.
and
i
believe
that
we
discussed
the
possibility
of
a
self-verifying
detailed
for
comparing
draper
to
this
case.
but
that
particular
detail
was
critical.
that
was
the
area
where
the
marijuana
was
supposed
to
have
been
placed
in
the
trunk
and
if
one
would
think
logically
that
the
letter
writer
said
that
lance
would
drive
it
back
by
himself.
well,
the
letter
writer
was
wrong.
that
fact
was
not
verified.
in
fact,
it
was
totally
contradicted
by
the
facts
of
the
case.
so
therefore,
there
was
nothing
that
was
done
after
the
warrant
was
signed
that
would
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
add
to
the
credibility
or
reliability
of
it.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
well,
this
court
has
directed
to
that
question
and
i
fully
agree
that
that
would
be
a
different
circumstance.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
entirely
different.
i
cite
as
this
court
has
discussed
in
defillippo
and
the
language
of
the
conduct
in
the
peltier
decision
regarding
the
border
search
or
roving
boarder
patrols.
i
feel
that--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--i
believe,
this
court
has
already
directed
their
attention
to
saying
that
a
policeman
acting
reasonably
on
a
statute
of
a
state
that
he
was
told
was
a
proper
statute
by
the
legislature
of
that
state,
that
reversing
that
decision
as
to
that
case
is
not
going
to
deter
police
officers,
because
they're
acting
in
conformance
with
the
law
of
the
state
that
is
established
specifically
by
a
statute.
and
i
believe
this
court
has
indicated
that.
that
makes
sense.
however,
the
legislature
was
wrong,
apparently,
if
this
court
feels
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
later.
i
see
a
difference,
however,
in
that
type
of
a
situation.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
well,
only
based
upon
this
court's
decision
in
defillippo.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
the
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief
makes
reference
to
a
case
called
on
lee
v.
the
united
states
regarding
the
use
of
informants.
and
since
we're
on
that
subject
i
wish
to
comment
on
on
lee.
on
lee
dealt
with
the
use
of
informants
as
witnesses
at
a
trial.
and
the
question
there
was
whether
they
should
testify.
and
if
so,
what
credibility
should
the
trier
of
fact
give
to
the
testimony
of
an
informant.
i
don't
know
what
relevance
that
case
has
to
the
case
before
this
court.
of
course
we're
talking
about
informants,
but
we're
talking
about
them
in
the
context
of
aguilar
and
spinelli,
which
makes
sense
when
you're
reviewing
a
hearsay
statement
to
determine
what
seems
to
be
logical.
if
the
hearsay
declarant
is
a
reliable
person
that
can
be
believed,
and
what
he
says
comes
from
some
personal
knowledge
or
comes
from
hearsay
observations
or
statements
by
someone
else,
the
on
lee
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
type
of
credibility.
they
say
also
u.
s.
v.
matlock,
stating
that
this
case
applies
to
a
search
warrant
procedure
and
judge's
decisions
to
give
whatever
right
he
wants
to
an
anonymous
letter.
the
matlock
court
was
dealing
with
the
use
of
hearsay
statements
at
a
motion
to
suppress
in
a
trial
court.
that
again,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
weight
to
be
given
to
an
anonymous
letter,
the
source
of
which
is
unknown
to
the
police,
the
magistrate,
and
everyone
else.
the
recent
cases...
getting
to
the
question
of
the
non-application
of
the
rule...
in
respondent's
opinion,
the
recent
cases
of
havens,
janis
and
calandra
do
not
support
the
position
of
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
in
that
the
court
had
stated
in
those
cases
that
there
was
no
possible
deterrent
function
that
could
arise
from
the
lack
of
use
of...
for
the
use,
rather,
of
unlawfully
seized
evidence
in,
for
example,
a
grand
jury
setting.
a
grand
jury
setting
being
totally
without
an
adversary
situation;
an
investigatory
body,
the
police
officer's
function
or
the
police
officer's
deterrence
really
not
effected
by
that
type
of
a
situation.
since,
obviously,
if
an
indictment
arises
from
the
grand
jury,
that
evidence
could
not
be
used
at
a
trial.
however,
the
mere
perfunctory
function
of
a
grand
jury
to
indict
and
to
formally
charge
someone,
the
deterrent
effect
would
not
be
violated.
similarly
in
havens
the
gentleman
who
was
stopped
at
the
airport
who
denied
later
at
trial
that
the
tee-shirt
which
was
found
in
his
suitcase
had
the
pieces
cut
out
of
it
which
contained
the
cocaine
in
his
partner's
suitcase,
when
he
got
up
and
lied
before
a
jury
and
said
that
tee-shirt
wasn't
his,
although
it
was
suppressed
in
a
lower
court,
this
court
ruled
rightly
that
he
should
be
impeached
by
that
because
the
fact
finding
and
truth
finding
process
of
a
trial
makes
more
sense.
again
in
janis
the
use
of
suppressed
evidence
in
a
federal
civil
tax
case
also
makes
sense.
and
as
the
justice
asked
me,
stone
v.
powell,
in
a
habeas
review,
if
the
state
had
given
a
full
and
fair
hearing
to
the
fourth
amendment
question
all
the
way
up
the
state's
highest
court,
then
there
is
no
need
to
review
it
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
that
again
does
not
destroy
the
deterrent
function.
i
distinguish
in
the
brief,
and
i
say
again
that
the
cases
such
as
u.
s.
v.
williams,
which
everyone
seems
to
be
relying
on
to
ask
this
court
to
adopt
an
exception,
can
be
distinguished
totally...
again
a
non-warrant
case...
that's
the
difference.
williams,
the
larger
majority
felt
there
was
probable
cause
in
that
case.
and
it's
understandable
if
one
reads
it
that
the
officer
who
made
the
arrest,
mr.
marconey,
knew
the
arrestee
because
he
had
arrested
her
before.
and,
i
believe
it
was
a
reasonable
mistake
a
fact
and
that's
what
the
court
held.
however,
i
believe,
he
had
probable
cause
as
did
the
larger
majority
in
the
williams
court.
the
court
has
already
indicated
several
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
incident
to
a
valid
arrest,
plain
view
cases,
auto
search
cases,
inventories,
border
searches,
consent
searches,
exigent
circumstances,
and,
even,
in
terry
v.
ohio
there
was
a
carved
out
exception
under
certain
circumstances
of
articulable
suspicion.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
are
asking
the
court
to
carve
out
another
exception
to
make,
if
a
good
faith
test
is
the
basis
for
an
admittedly
no
probable
cause
warrant,
then,
what
good
is
the
warrant
process
itself.
they
indicate
a
warrant
can
be
lacking
in
probable
cause,
but
still
good
anyhow
if
the
officer
thought
it
was.
i
don't
believe
the
court
is
going
to
adopt
such
a
standard
in
light
of
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
itself.
as
this
court
said
in
the
united
states
v.
ross
last
year,
good
faith
is
not
enough
to
constitute
probable
cause.
that
faith
must
be
grounded
on
facts
within
the
knowledge
of
the
officer
which
in
the
judgment
of
the
court
would
make
his
faith
reasonable.
it's
not
just
the
judgment
of
the
officer.
it
has
to
be
reviewed
because
of
the
ex
parte
nature
of
the
warrant
process
itself.
there
are
defenders
of
the
rule,
i
believe,
the...
one
of
the
most
important
defender
was
a
little
six
page
brief
filed
by
mr.
johnston,
the
prosecutor
in
polk
county,
iowa.
if
one
were
to
want
to
ask
about
statistics,
and
i
don't
necessarily
believe
in
the
empirical
studies
and
i
know
this
court
has
indicated
in
its
opinions
that
there
may
not
be
any
that
are
really
viable.
but
mr.
johnston
said
as
a
prosecutor
that
the
rule
has
served
no
serious
impediment
to
prosecuting
the
guilty.
the
rule
has
fostered
police
professionalism.
he
cites
in
his
brief
in
1980
over
6,487
cases
prosecuted
in
his
office,
only
thirteen
of
which
were
dismissed
and
only
nine
of
those
involved
narcotic
cases.
that's
two
out
of
a
thousand
that
were
dismissed
because
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
i
think
that
is
probably
the
most
meaningful
statistic
that
i've
ever
seen.
as
a
prosecutor,
he
feels
that
the
mapp
case
was
a
firm
admonishment,
that
even
a
worthy
law
enforcement
end
cannot
justify
an
unconstitutional
means.
he
feels
that
police
are
better
trained
since
mapp.
he
says
the
result
of
any
exception
would
be
a
signal
to
law
enforcement
to
take
the
forth
amendment
not
so
seriously.
i
know
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
statements
of
others
who
have
testified
before
or
written
letters
to
the
senate
subcommittee
on
the
exclusionary
rule.
steven
saks
is
another
example,
the
attorney
general
of
maryland
says
there
is
much
more
corporation
between
prosecutors
and
agents
of
law
enforcement
as
a
result
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
bottom
line
is
the
prosecutor
and
the
policeman
want
to
convict
if
the
evidence
can
stand
up
in
court.
so,
it
would
be
as
stated
by
judge
stern,
it
would
be
a
slander
on
the
police,
and
a
slander
on
the
fbi
and
the
district
attorney
and
the
united
states
attorney,
to
say
that
they
would
not
follow
this
court's
decisions
when
they
know
that
the
exclusionary
rule
would
apply
if
they
did
not.
even
professor
ball,
a
proponent
of
good
faith,
concedes
that
the
rule
has
accomplished
increased
police
training
and
awareness
about
their
responsibilities.
commissioner
murphy,
after
the
mapp
decision
said
there
was
a
total
reconstruction
in
his
police
department
in
new
york
as
a...
from
the
top
down
to
the
foot
patrolman
as
a
result
of
the
court's
decision.
to
what
weight
the
court
will
give
it
i
do
not
know,
but
we
cite
in
our
brief
a
footnote
10a
and
obviously
this
as
10a
came
as
an
afterthought
only
because
the
quote
came
in
a
newspaper
shortly
before
the
brief
was
completed.
the
detective
who
authored
the
affidavit
in
this
case
was
quoted
in
a
chicago
newspaper
as
saying,
if
he
knew
then
what
he
knew
now
about
the
exclusionary
rule
he
would
have
better
corroborated
the
information.
this
court
need
only
look
to
the
array
of
a
amici
briefs
filed
in
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
and
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
as
evidence
of
the
fact
that
the
rule
does
in
fact
deter.
thirty-four
states
have
either
filed
or
joined
in
the
filing
of
amicus
briefs
in
this
case.
the
international
association
of
chiefs
of
police
have
filed.
the
national
district
attorneys
association
has
filed
as
well
as
an
array
of
amici
on
behalf
of
the
respondent.
that
indicates,
i
believe,
that
there
is
attention
drawn
to
this
only
because
of
the
effect
of
the
exclusionary
rule
itself,
the
deterrent
function.
perhaps
the
amici
on
the
petitioners
side
are
complaining
because
the
rule
works
too
well.
if
such
a
modification
were
adopted,
even
on
an
objective
rationale,
the
practical
effect
in
police
departments
will
be
that
instead
of
strict
compliance
with
decisions
of
this
court
police
will
err
more
in
favor
of
every
questionable
conduct
and
not
even
in
close
cases,
thus
making
their
own
law.
the
police
will
really
be
telling
the
court
what
the
fourth
amendment
means.
review
will
be
extremely
tedious
because
of
the
standard
of
being
objective
will
require
someone
to
develop
criteria
against
which
the
standard
can
be
measured.
thus,
fourth
amendment
law
will
be
reduced
to
a
series
of
ad
hoc
decisions
instead
of
on
a
categorical
basis
so
that
law
enforcement
officials
can
have
workable
rules.
and
that
conduct,
of
course,
was
shunned
upon
in
the
dunnaway
decision.
the
fourth
amendment
body
of
law
cannot
be
ad
hoc
decisions.
it
must
be
a
categorical
body
of
law
so
that
the
institution
of
police,
not
just
the
individual
police
officer,
can
understand
what
this
court
says
is
proper
under
the
fourth
amendment.
this
court
should
not
modify
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
case.
the
warrant
process
contains
sufficient
leeway
in
the
context
of
reasonableness
in
its
definition
of
probable
cause.
any
lesser
standard
will
encourage
police
not
to
comport
their
conduct
to
the
standard
of
probable
cause.
the
cost
of
keeping
the
rule
in
terms
of
freeing
some
defendants
is
small
in
contrast
to
the
overall
benefit
to
society
of
keeping
law
enforcement
in
check
and
maintaining
the
delicate
balance
between
individual
freedom
and
the
effective
law
enforcement.
unless
there
are
some
questions,
i
have
no
further
comments.
