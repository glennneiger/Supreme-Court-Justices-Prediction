justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
reilley,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
may
be
relevant
to
the
issue
of
self-verification.
do
you
see
anything
unusual
at
all
about
a
man
flying
1000
miles,
of
all
places,
to
palm
beach,
arriving
at
8:00
o'clock
at
night
and
leaving
at
5:00
the
next
morning?
palm
beach?
[laughter]
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
only
suggestion
you've
made,
as
i
recall,
is
that
he
may
have
made
up
with
his
wife.
i
would
have
thought
if
he'd
made
up
with
his
wife
he
would
have
wanted
to
stay
at
palm
beach.
[laughter]
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
general
while
you
are
talking
about
what
happened
to
lowe,
the
brief
of
your
opponent
suggests
that
the
constitution
of
illinois
has
an
exclusionary
rule
and
that
this
case
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
it.
that
might
come
first,
logically.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
reilley?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
involves
police
reliance
on
a
search
warrant.
what
would
you
think
of
a
case
where
the
police
relied
on
the
validity
of
a
statute
that
subsequently
was
held
invalid?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
entirely
different.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
you...
would
you
think
it
appropriate
to
modify
the
exclusionary
rule
when
police
do
rely
on
a
statute
subsequently
held
unconstitutional?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
stone
against
powell,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
a
habeas
case,
invalidated
the
arrest
of
an
individual,
i
think
it
was
in
another
state,
perhaps
arizona,
where
the
warrant
subject
to
the
ordinance
upon
which
the
policeman
had
acted
subsequently
was
declared
invalid.
so
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
made
an
error
in
that
case.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
