justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
part
of
the
test
about
truthfulness,
about
honesty.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
suggest
that
if
a
policeman
comes
in
and
says
i
have
good
cause
to
believe
that
there
are
stolen
goods
at
a
certain
address,
please
give
me
a
warrant.
now,
the
magistrate
knows
him
as
an
honest
officer
who
always
tells
the
truth,
and
he
knows
he's
experienced.
do
you
think
that's
enough
to
get
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
happens...
nathanson
happens
to
be
the
basis
for
the
aguilar
requirement
that
the
officer,
or
whoever
it
is,
gives
the
basis
for
his
belief.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
you
don't
really
mean
what
you
said
a
while
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
that
both
prongs
of
aguilar
shouldn't
apply
in
certain
circumstances.
neither
one
of
them
should
apply
in
certain
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
apparently...
you
do
agree
that
there
must
be
some
basis
for
the
person's
assertion
that
there's
a
crime
being
committed.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
are
you
complaining
about
aguilar's
requirement
that
there
must
be
a
showing
of
the
basis
for
the
belief?
you
apparently
don't
take
exception
to
that,
do
you?
you
think
nathanson
is
right,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you
think
there
should
be
a
showing
of
the
basis,
and
that
that
requirement
was
satisfied
in
this
case.
