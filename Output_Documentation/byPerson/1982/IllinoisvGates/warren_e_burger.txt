chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
illinois
against
gates.
mr.
biebel,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--what
month
of
the
year
did
this
occur
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
reilley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
initial
address?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
that...
the
man
had
simply
overlooked
sending
his
change
of
address
to
the
motor
vehicle
department.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
difference
does
this
make
to
the
ultimate
fact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
that
the
letter
had
said
that
mrs.
gates
would
be
wearing
a
red
leather
jacket
when
she
was
down
in
florida,
and
it
turned
out
she
was
wearing
a
brown
leather
jacket.
would
you
say
that
that's
relevant
to
anything
in
this
scheme?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
motive
got
to
do
with
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
we
to
take
it
from
that
that
if
mrs.
gates
had
registered
as
mrs.
jones
and
in
getting
his
airline
ticket
he
said
his
name
was
anderson,
that
then
you
wouldn't
be
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
they
do.
now
clearly,
the
evidence,
as
it
has
demonstrated,
shows
he
was
a
drug
courier,
but
he
did
not
use
a
false
name.
so
your--
--your
honor,
the
evidence
shows
that
he
was
a
drug
courier,
only
after
they
opened
the
trunk.
well,
but
that's
the
fact.
you
just
made
the
statement
that
drug
couriers
use
false
names.
now,
here
was
a
drug
courier
who
did
not
use
a
false
name.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
your
generalization
is
not
very
reliable,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
suggesting
that
when
there's
an
anonymous
tip,
then,
there
must
be
100
percent
accuracy
on
predicting
future
conduct.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
he
wants
to
stay
alive.
[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
next
week
a
letter
comes
into
the
same
people
as
were
involved
here
giving
the
details
of
some
other
drug
smuggler,
and
the
police
officer
looking
at
it
says
this
looks
like
the
same
handwriting
as
that
fellow
that
we
had
in
the
gates
case,
which
we...
he
is
saying
we
lost
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
so
they
pull
in
the
handwriting
expert
and
he
says
yes,
this
is
the
same
handwriting;
the
same
person
wrote
both
these
letters.
now,
they
go
before
the
magistrate
and
present
to
the
magistrate
the
facts
i've
just
recited,
plus
all
the
contents
of
the
tip.
do
you
think
they've
now
made
out
a
case
of
reasonably
reliable
trustworthy
informant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
take
it
one
step
beyond
now.
the
police
act
on
this
second
letter
which
they
think
is
written
by
the
writer
of
the
first
letter,
and
they
catch
the
smuggler
and
he's
convicted,
but
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
sets
aside
that
conviction
on
the
same
ground
that
you've
just
advanced.
now,
a
month
from
now
they
get
a
third
letter
exactly
the
same
prediction
about
some
other
activity,
and
the
handwriting
experts
say
yes,
that's
the
same
source.
it's
still
no
good,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
biebel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
biebel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
haven't
a
number
of
cases
added
another
factor,
as
seen
by
a
policeman
in
light
of
his
experience,
not
in
the
light
of
the
judge's
experience.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
there's
another
step
for
the
policeman
to
take.
the
policeman
has
the
warrant
in
his
hand.
he
is
not
a
lawyer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
presumptively
valid
at
that
time,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
reilley--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
didn't
the
court
decide
it
on
that
ground
exclusively,
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree,
mr.
reilley,
that
a
warrant
once
issued
on
the
question
for
this
is
presumptively
valid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--to
what
extent
did
the
subsequent
events
bear
out
the
accuracy
of
the
anonymous
letter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you.
mr.
solicitor
general,
excuse
me,
mr.
attorney
general,
there
is
only
one
minute
remaining.
do
you
wish
to
make
any
use
of
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
