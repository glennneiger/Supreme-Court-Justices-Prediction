justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
why?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
a
question
of
procedure.
you
stated
the
title
in
fee
simple
blossomed
in
the
purchaser
at
the
tax
sale
after
the
expiration
period.
does
he
nevertheless
have
to
go
into
court
on
a
quiet
title
action?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
anyway,
he'd
have
to
go
in
and
get
his
title
cleared
up?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
this
is
when
your
people
got
the
notice.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
does
an
ordinary
bank
mortgagee
do
in
indiana?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
they
went
into
the
business
in
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
that
because
of
this
litigation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
cohen,
i
suppose
it's
totally
irrelevant
but
was
mrs.
moore
a
member
of
the
church?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
all
of
those
under
the
federal
constitution
or
under
state
constitutions?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
if
we
were
in
a
title
state
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
yet
the
loss
is
just
as
great,
whether
it's
non-ownership
or--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--or
estate
or
a
title
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
now,
why
do
you
say
that?
suppose
you
had
addressed
an
envelope--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--to
the
mennonite
board
of
missions,
county
seat,
wayne
county,
indiana...
whatever
it
is...
why
do
you
think
it
might
not
well
find
its
way?
