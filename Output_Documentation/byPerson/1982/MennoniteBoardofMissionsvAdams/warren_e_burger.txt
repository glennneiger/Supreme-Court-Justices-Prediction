we'll
hear
argument
next
in
mennonite
board
of
missions
versus
adams.
mr.
cohen,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
part
of
the
response
to
justice
blackmun's
question,
indeed,
that
in
many
cases
banks
and
insurance
companies
that
have
numerous
mortgages
that
they
are
holding
arrange...
make
arrangements
to
see
that
all
of
the
legal
publications
are
sent
to
them
and
checked
by
someone.
that's
inherent
in
the
notice
by
publication
system,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
the
bank
sees
the
notice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
this
is
not
inherence,
and
part
of
the
system
of
lending
on
secured
loans
with
mortgages
or
trusts,
that
there's
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
holder
of
the
mortgage
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
situation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
no
requirements
for
a
bank
or
an
insurance
company
to
keep
a
close
check
on
possible
foreclosures
or
additional
liens
against
their
security,
but
they
do
it
as
a
matter
of
prudence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
recording
of
the
mortgage
deed,
is
an
address
given
for
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
to
which
notice
could
be
sent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
a
small
community,
how
would
one
go
about
finding
out
the...
where
to
locate
the
mennonite
board
of
missions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i'm...
that's
why
i
pointedly
did
not
pick
elkhart.
we
don't
decide
constitutional
questions
just
for
elkhart,
indiana.
the
generality
is
of
some
importance.
now,
let
us
say
in
fairfax
county,
virginia,
or
anywhere
out
in
the
rural
virginia,
how
would
you
go
about
finding
the
mennonite
board
of
missions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
could
you
find
out
if
you
wanted...
suppose
you
wanted
to
join
the
church?
let's
make
it
something
to
their
interests.
how
would
you
go
about
finding
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i'm...
some
people
might
be
that
much
interested
in
it
to
make
such
a
call,
but
a
great
many
might
not
be.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
country
has
gone
for
about
almost
two
hundred
years
now
with
notice
by
publication
in
many
areas,
affecting
important
rights.
you
speak
of
it
as
though
this
is
something
written
in
the
constitution
or
implied.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
not
in
this
precise
context.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
had
been,
you
wouldn't
have
to
be
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
going
to
assume
that
indiana
has
a
lien
law
comparable
to
all
other
states
so
that
a
mechanic
or
a
laborer
who
performs
some
services
or
furnishes
materials
could
file
a
lien
on
the
property.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
that's
certainly
a
property
right,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
it
essentially
an
indiana
law
the
same
as
the
mortgage
lienor's...
mortgagees
lien
rights?
each
has
a
lien.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
that
published
notice
for
the
purpose
of
attracting
a
lot
people
to
come
in
and
bid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one?
isn't
that
the
primary
reason
in
terms
of
getting...
trying
to
liquidate
the
indebtedness,
whether
it's
a
tax
sale
or
a
mortgage
sale.
whoever
has
the
money
due
is
trying
to
get
it
back
so
there's
a
real
purpose...
the
publication
is
not
a
matter
of
form.
it's
a
matter
of
substance,
and
there
are
people
who
are
scanning
the
published
notices
every
day
in
the
week
and
every
city
in
this
county
and
deciding
whether
they
want
to
go
in
and
bid.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
serves
a
real
purpose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--where
is
it
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up,
counselor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
cohen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
