does
the
record
show
the
contents
of
the
notice
that
was
published
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
in...
what
is
contained
in
that
published
form
of
notice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
mortgagee's
name
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
i'm
just
asking
about
the
published
notice,
what
it
contained.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
think
this
court's
previous
holdings
give
an
indication
that
we
would
regard
a
mortgage
interest
as
so
insignificant
as
to
not
come
within
the
kinds
of
interests
that
we
have
protected--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
a
mullane
type
doctrine?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
do
you
concede
that
notice
by
mail
would
be
more
effective
for
the
mortgagees?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
it
is
hard
to
understand
how
that
would
have
helped
the
board
in
this
case
with
no
address,
and
i
don't
think
our
cases
have
gone
so
far
as
to
require
county
sheriffs
to
go
out
personally
and
look
for
locations.
