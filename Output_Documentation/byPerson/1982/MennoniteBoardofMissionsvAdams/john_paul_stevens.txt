justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
there
was
no
notice
before
either
the
tax
sale
or
the
expiration
of
the
redemption
period.
in
your
view
would
notice
be
adequate
if
either
one
of
those
was
given?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
miller,
does
the
dissent
in
the
new
jersey
case,
which
i
have
not
read,
or
maybe
you
have
if
an
argument
ready,
what
is
the
state
interest
in
not
giving
notice?
i
suppose
the
state...
you
say
it's
a
life
blood...
taxation
is
the
life
blood
of
the
state,
and
they
need
the
money.
wouldn't
it
be
to
their
interest
to
give
notice
to
as
many
people
who
might
possibly--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--pay
up?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
in
the
case
of
mortgages,
it
occurs
to
me
that,
although
of
course
70
or
80
percent
of
the
mortgages
are
held
by
big
institutions,
when
interest
rates
get
real
high
as
they
have
been
in
the
last
few
years,
there
are
a
lot
of
purchase
money
mortgages
held
by
individuals
on
second
mortgage
interests
and
the
like
and
i
suppose
that's
the
area
in
which
there's
the
possibility
of
this
sort
of
thing
happening.
justice
john
paul
stevens
actually,
i
guess
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
indiana
court
didn't
really
rely
on
the
difficulty
in
finding
the
mortgagee,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wasn't
necessary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
the
new
indiana
statute
requires
that
the
mortgagee
designate
his
address
when
he
records
his
mortgage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
nevertheless
requires
mailed
notice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i--
