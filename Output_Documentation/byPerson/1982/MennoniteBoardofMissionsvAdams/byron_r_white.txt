and
was
in
possession?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
prevalent
are
the
statutes
requiring
notice
to
mortgagees?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
remaining
case
of
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
how
about
the
other
states
besides
the
21?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
inference
is
that
all
the
other
states
besides
the
21,
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
not,
the
number
would
be
more
than
21.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
started
out
by
saying
it
was
a
property
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
a
property
right
isn't
an
interest
in
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
owned
by
the
mortgagee?
no,
it's--
--it
belongs
to
the
mortgagee?
it's
his
right?
i'll
put
it
that
way,
is
it
his
right?
or
its
rights
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
think
that
most
of
the
professional
moneylenders,
big
institutions
whom
you
say
can
take
care...
whom
you
say
can
take
care
of
themselves,
would
take
care
of
themselves
in
a
way
that
there
would
never
be
an
occasion
to
have
a
tax
sale
or
send
out
any
notice.
they
would
follow...
they
would
know
when
there...
at
least
if
they
use
some
mechanisms,
they
would
know...
they
would
make
sure
that
the
taxes
are
paid.
so
the
classic
cases
in
which,
the
universe
of
cases
in
which
you're
going
to
have
to
have
a
foreclosure
or
send
out
a
notice
are
going
to
be
reduced
to
a
lot
of
people
mostly
who
don't
take
care
of
themselves,
and
don't
know
enough
to
take
care
of
themselves.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
suppose
you
have
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
argument
i
would
think
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument
if
they
never
published
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
notice,
no
publication.
justice
byron
r.
white
mortgagees
can
take
care
of
themselves.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
know
that
nonprofessionals
aren't
going
to
go
look...
go
get
any
notice
from
publication.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
actual
notice,
just
notice.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
serve
the
purpose
of
giving
notice
to
the
mortgagees.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
want
to
know
when
the
sale
is
so
they
can
bid.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
an
alternate
ground
for
affirming?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
we
get
mail
directed
to
judge
zilch,
care
of
the
department
of
justice,
washington,
d.c.,
but
it
comes
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
ten
dollars?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
so--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
he
has
to...
does
he
have
to
pay
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
when
he
gets
the
notice
or
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
whenever
he
takes
mortgage
he
writes
a
check
to
the
auditor
and
says--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
the
event
taxes
aren't
paid
please
notify
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
right
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
every
county
may
be
different
on
the
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
do
you
know
what
the
fee
is
in
this
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
