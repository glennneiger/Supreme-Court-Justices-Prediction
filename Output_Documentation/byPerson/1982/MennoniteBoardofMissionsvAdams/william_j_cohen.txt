mr.
william
j.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
indiana
court
of
appeals.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
the
indiana
tax
sale
statutes
which
were
in
effect
at
the
time
this
case
arose
violate
due
process
in
equal
protection.
it
is
the
position
of
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
that
the
indiana
tax
sale
statutes
violate
due
process
because
they
only
provide
for
constructive
notice
to
a
mortgagee
of
record.
the
statutes
only
provided
for
notice
by
posting
at
the
courthouse
and
publication
in
a
newspaper.
this
case
arose
as
a
quiet
title
action
filed
by
the
appellee,
richard
c.
adams.
mr.
adams
had
purchased
the
property
at
1829
stevens
avenue
in
elkhart
at
a
tax
sale
on
august
8,
1977.
prior
to
the
tax
sale,
jean
moore
owned
the
property
in
fee
simple.
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
had
a
mortgage
on
that
property.
the
most
significant
fact
in
this
case
is
that
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
mortgage
was
recorded.
it
was
a
matter
of
public
record.
it
was
found
in
the
elkhart
county
recorder's
office
in
volume
388,
page
693
of
the
elkhart
county
records.
the
name
and
address
of
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
was
thus
a
matter
of
public
record.
under
the
terms
of
that
mortgage
moore
was
required
to
pay
the
property
taxes.
she
failed
to
pay
those
taxes.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
no,
it
does
not,
justice
blackmun,
as
to
why
she
did
not
pay
the
taxes.
but
she
was,
despite
not
paying
the
taxes,
she
was
paying
that
mortgage
each
month
to
the
mennonite
board
of
missions,
which
i
think
is
also
a
very
significant
point.
under
indiana
law
if
the
taxes
aren't
paid
on
property
for
more
than
15
months,
the
county
auditor
will
compile
a
list
of
delinquent
property
tax...
properties.
and,
in
this
case,
they
would
then
send
notice
under
indiana
law
to
the
legal
title
owner.
indiana
law
does
not
provide
any
mailed
notice
to
an
owner
of
the
property.
it
is
the
position
of
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
that
due
process
requires,
at
a
minimum,
mailed
notice
to
a
mortgagee
of
record.
had
there
been
notice
mailed
to
the
mennonite
board
of
missions,
in
this
case,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
would
have
paid
the
taxes.
that's
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
soon
after
they
learned
that
the
property
had
actually
been
sold
for
delinquent
taxes,
they
immediately
tendered
to
the
trial
court
the
statutory
amount
due
to
redeem
their
property.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
the
mortgage
was
filed
in
the
county
records
in
goshen.
the
county
auditor's
office
is
in
the
same
city.
their
name
and
address
was
on
the
mortgage.
more
importantly,
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
offices
have
been
located
in
elkhart
county
for
over
50
years.
the--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--justice
rehnquist,
if
the
mortgage
was
not
recorded,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
county
auditor
would
be
forced
to
search
titles
and
give
notice
to
anybody.
if
the
mortgage
wasn't
recorded,
they
couldn't
have
sent
notice.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
that
is
a
question
that
is
not
applicable
to
this
case,
but
that
would
be
something
that
would
be
a
fact
question
that
would
possibly
relieve
the
county
auditor
from
sending
notice...
actual
notice.
but
i
do
believe
that
if
the
mortgage
was
recorded
in
your
given
hypothetical,
then
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
county
auditor
to
send
notice
to
the
last
known
address.
in
this
case--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--yes,
i
believe
he
would
unless
the
county
auditor
knew
that
the
mortgagor...
or
rather
the
mortgagee
had
actually
moved.
if
the
facts
could
be
shown
that
the
county
auditor
knew
that
the
mortgagee's
address
had
changed
and
the
county
auditor
knew
that,
i
think
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
county
auditor
to
send
notice
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
no,
it
does
not,
justice
o'connor.
but
we
are
not
questioning
the
form
of
published
notice
given
in
this
case
itself.
we're
saying,
however,
that
published--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--under
indiana
law,
the
statutes
provide
that
the
name
of
the
owner
of
the
property
will
be
listed,
an
address,
if
possible,
but
it
does
not
require
a
specific
street
address.
the
legal
title
should
be
in
the
notice,
and
that's--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--there
is
no
present...
there
is
no
requirement
under
the
indiana
law
in
effect
at
the
time
this
case
arose
to
send
mailed
notice
at
all
to
a
mortgagee.
that
is--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--okay.
it
would
contain
the
name
of
the
legal
title
owner.
it
would
not
contain
the
name
of
the
mortgagee.
in
this
particular
case,
the
published
records
of
elkhart
county
demonstrate
that
although
the
county
auditor
sent
notice
to
moore,
she
never
picked
up
the
certified
mailing,
that
the
property
was
then
sold
to
adams,
but
significantly,
moore
continued
to
pay
the
property...
to
pay
the
money
due
and
owing
under
the
mortgage
to
the
mennonite
board
of
missions.
indiana
law
provides
for
a
two-year
period
of
time
to
redeem
the
property
following
the
sale
at...
by
a
county
official.
the
indiana
statutes
provide
for
giving
notice
to
the
legal
title
owner
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
redemption
period.
but
there
was
absolutely
no
provision
in
indiana
law
at
the
time
this
case
arose
to
notify
a
mortgagee
of
record
that
the
redemption
period
is
about
to
expire.
under
indiana
law,
once
the
redemption
period
expires
the
tax
deed
purchaser,
in
this
case
adams,
obtains
a
fee
simple
absolute,
free
and
clear
of
any
prior
lien
or
encumbrance.
in
this
case
we
submit
to
this
court
that
the
fact
that
the
notice
was
only
constructive
and,
by
posting
and
publication
initially
to
the
mennonite
board
of
missions,
in
conjunction
with
the
fact
that
there
was
absolutely
no
notice
given
at
all
to
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
redemption
period,
results
in
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
having
their
prior
reported
mortgage
taken
from
them
by
state
action
with
inadequate
notice
and
without
any
compensation
at
all.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
he
does,
justice
blackmun.
but
the
statute
provides
that
if
notice
were
given
to
the
legal
title
owner
and
that
is
then
prima
facie
evidence
that
the
tax
sale
was
conducted
in
an
improper
manner.
we
do
not
represent
jean
moore.
our
interests
are
not
the
same
as
hers.
we
could
not
represent
her
for
that
reason.
we
do
not
dispute
the
fact
that
there
was
notice
sent
to
moore
under
the
statute,
although
she
never
picked
up
the
notice,
but--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--yes,
but--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--that
was
the
first
time
they
actually
learned
that
the
property
had
been
sold
for
taxes.
just--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--well,
justice
blackmun,
i'm
not
really
sure
what
an
ordinary
bank
would
do
in
indiana.
i'm
sure
that
many
banks
would
vary
their
type
of
arrangements
of
looking
after
their
particular
loan.
however,
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
is
not
a
professional
money-lending
institution.
it's
a
charitable
religious
organization,
a
branch
of
the
mennonite
church.
they
were
not
in
the
business
of
making
money.
they
loaned
money--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--much
to
their
chagrin,
at
this
time.
however--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--i
think
notice
by
posting
and
publication
to
a
bank
or
to
the
mennonite
board
of
missions,
each,
under
indiana
law
would
be
unconstitutional.
this
court--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--not
if
the
bank
actually
saw
the
notice,
your
honor,
no.
if
the
bank
actually
had
actual
notice,
had
seen
the
publication,
we
have
a
different
case.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
i
think
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
did
exactly
that
in
this
case.
they
did
the
one
most
important
thing
they
could
do
to
protect
their
interests.
they
recorded
it,
and
it
was
a
matter
of
public
record.
it
was
notice
to
the
elkhart
county
auditor
of
what
their
interest
was.
it
was
notice
to
the
whole
world
of
what
their
interest
was.
there
was
no
requirement
under
indiana
law
that
they
do
anything
else.
a
professional--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--they
have,
perhaps,
the
resources
and
the
sophistication
to
do
that,
but
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
as
a
charitable
organization
was
not
accustomed
to
doing
something
like
that
nor
did
the
law
require
that
they
do
that.
they
did
everything,
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
law
required
them
to
do
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
cohen,
was
your
client's
interest
in
the
property
totally
destroyed
by
the
fact
of
the
tax
sale
purchase
alone,
or
is...
to
follow
up
on
justice
blackman's
question,
was
there
yet
to
be
another
proceeding
whereby
the
tax
sale
purchaser
confirmed
his
title?
his...
our
interest
was
finally
adjudicated
in
the
quiet
title
action
itself
but
the
adjudication
was
a
foregone
conclusion,
is
what
i
meant
to
say
to
mr.
justice
blackmun.
that
is,
under
indiana
law,
once
the
tax
deed
purchaser
obtained
his
tax
deed
from
the
county
auditor
after
the
expiration
of
the
redemption
period,
under
indiana
law
he
had
the
property
free
and
clear.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
that's
correct.
by
the
time
our
client
obtained
actual
notice
of
the
tax
sale
itself
it...
the
redemption
period
expired
and
they
were
never
given
an
opportunity.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
the
redemption
period
is
two
years
when
the
property
is
purchased
by
a
private
individual
as
in
this
case.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
in
the
meantime,
the
mortgagor,
moore,
continued
to
pay
them
each
month
on
the
mortgage.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
and
was
in
possession
of
the
property.
there
was
no
attack
on
that
property,
so
to
speak,
by
the
state
of
indiana.
the
only
situation
that
happened
was
posting
and
publication
in
a
newspaper
to
the
mennonite
board
of
missions.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
as
far
as
what
type
of
sophisticated
mortgage
transaction
there
may
be
in
the
case
you
mentioned
as
far
as
escrowing
the
money,
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
mennonites
are
trusting
people.
when
they
had
the
mortgage
with
moore,
and
moore
was
required
to
pay
the
taxes,
they
believed
she
would
do
it.
and
she
continued
to
pay
the--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--under
the
facts
of
this
case
i
do
believe
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
i
think
the
focus
of
this
court
really
should
be
on
what
the
state
did,
or
really
what
the
state
failed
to
do.
that
is,
the
state
failed
to
send
adequate
notice
in
this
case.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
had
there
been
mailed
notice
to
the
mennonite
board
of
missions,
yes.
in
fact,
as
this
case
was
pending...
as
it
worked
its
way
up
the
appellate
level
in
the
state
of
indiana,
the
indiana
legislature
actually
amended
the
tax
sale
statutes,
and
they
now
provide
for
the
very
type
of
notice
that
we
are
requesting
here.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
i
submit
that
that's
in
all
likelihood
true,
justice
blackmun.
i
think
it's
a
legislative
recognition
by
the
indiana
legislature
that
the
system
that
was
in
effect
was
simply
unconstitutional,
that
it
was
not
difficult
or
burdensome
for
a
county
auditor
to
look
at
the
public
records
and
send
notice.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
are
you
talking
about
nationwide,
justice
white?
mr.
william
j.
cohen
there
is
a
yale
law
review
article
cited
in
the
brief
and
it
is
a
1975
article.
in
that
brief
it
talks
about
21
states
that
only
provide
for
notice
by
posting
and
publication,
and
i
might
add
the
author
urges
those
legislatures
to
amend
those
statutes.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
of
those
21
there...
since
that
law
review
article--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--most
states
do
provide
for
notice
by
mail
to
owners
of
property.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
i
can't...
i
cannot
affirmatively
tell
you
that.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
it
may
well
be
the
remaining
29
do,
justice
white,
but
i
do
not
know
for
sure.
i
cannot
tell
you
at
this
point.
but
i
think--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--no,
she
was
not
a
member
of
the
mennonite
church,
and
this
was
an
arms-length
transaction
between
the
parties.
she
was
not
the
agent
of
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
nor
was
she
the
caretaker
for
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
in
this
particular
case.
it
was
an
arms-length
transaction
and,
in
this
case,
there
is
inadequate
notice
to
the
mennonite
board
of
missions.
as
mrs.--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--okay.
in
the
mortgage
that
was
recorded
in
elkhart
it
lists
the
mennonite
board
of
missions.
the
specific
street
address
is
not
listed,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
elkhart
county,
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
are
well-known.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
your
question.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
in
fairfax,
virginia?
you
might
call
elkhart,
indiana
and
find
out.
[laughter]
mr.
william
j.
cohen
but,
confining
ourselves
to
the
specific
facts
of
this
case,
this
court
has
said
that
adequate
notice
under
due
process
is
notice
reasonably
calculated
to
inform
interested
persons
of
a
pending
action
to
provide
them
an
opportunity
to
appear
and
assert
their
rights.
in
this
particular
case,
under
the
indiana
statute
in
effect
at
the
time
this
case
arose,
notice
by
posting
and
publication
is
simply
inadequate,
that
it
would
be
a
very
relative,
easy
matter
for
the
elkhart
county
auditor
to
have
sent
notice
by
mail.
this
court
has
set
forth
the
balancing
test
of
what
should
be
looked
at
as
far
as
what
due
process
is
accorded
in
a
given
situation.
in
this
case,
the
private
interest
at
stake
is
the
permanent
loss
of
the
mennonite
board
of
missions'
mortgage
without
any
adequate
notice
of
the
initial
tax
sale.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
they
did
not
have
anything
like
that.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
they
could
have,
justice
marshall,
but
again,
i
think
what
private
individuals
may
do
is
not
the
focus
of
this
case.
what
the
mennonites
or
a
bank
could
have
done
is
not
the
focus.
the
focus--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--because
constitutionally
i
believe
the
focus
should
be
on
what
the
state
did.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
this
is
something
that
has
been
determined
by
this
court
in
mullane...
in
the
mullane
case
and
has
been
determined
by--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--the--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
comparison
with
the
facts
of
this
case
as
to
what
happened
in
mullane,
there...
i
submit
to
this
court,
this
case
falls
squarely
within
mullane,
that
this
case
cannot
really
be
distinguished
from
mullane.
and
on
that
basis,
i
submit
that
this
court
would
have
to
reverse
the
indiana
court
of
appeals.
and
this
case,
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
also
falls
squarely
within
the
case
decided
by
this
court,
the
city...
walker
versus
city
of
hutchinson
cases.
in
that
case
this
court
said
that
notice
by
publication
only
of
a
condemnation
action
where
the
owner
of
the
property's
name
and
address
were
a
matter
of
public
record
is
unconstitutional.
and
similarly
this
court
in
city...
schroeder
versus
city
of
new
york
did
the
same
thing.
in
that
case
it
was
another
condemnation
action
and
the
owner's
name
and
address
was
a
matter
of
public
record
and
this
court
held
the
new
york
statute
in
that
case
unconstitutional
for
the
same
reason.
that
is,
there
was
not
adequate
notice
given
where
the
name
and
address
is
known,
that
due
process
requires
at
a
minimum
notice
by
mail.
this
court
recently,
just
last
term,
in
green
v.
lindsey
reaffirmed
those
well-entrenched
principles
established
in
mullane.
the
green
v.
lindsey
case
involved
the
kentucky
forceful
entry
and
detainer
act.
in
that
case
the
procedure
utilized
by
kentucky
is
more
likely
intended
to
reach
a
tenant.
the
case
involved
an
eviction
of
a
tenant
and
in
the
kentucky
statutes
it
first
provided
for
personal
service
by
the
sheriff.
there
was
absolutely
no
requirement
of
personal
service
in
this
case.
if
the
tenant
was
not
home
that
case
provided
for
posting
on
the
door
of
the
tenant's
apartment.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
posting
on
the
property
or
an
intrusion
on
the
property
by
the
state
is
far
more
likely
or
reasonably
calculated
to
inform
a
person
of
an
eviction
action
than
is
the
form
of
notice
chosen
by
indiana
in
this
case.
there
have
been
other
states
that
have
considered
virtually
the
same
question
as
raised
in
this
case.
in
the
state
of
arizona,
the
arizona
supreme
court,
back
in
1954,
determined
that
the
sale
of
property
by
posting...
rather
publication...
only
violated
due
process
as
established
by
this
court
in
the
mullane
case
and
in
the
schroeder
case.
the
state
of
florida
has
ruled
the
same
way.
the
state
of
kansas
and
the
state
of
michigan,
the
state
of
missouri
and
the
state
of
new
jersey
are
all--
mr.
william
j.
cohen
--the...
all
of
those
cases
interpreted
this
court's
rulings
in
mullane
and
in
schroeder
and
in
walker
and
all
talked
about
the
federal
constitution
and
not
state
constitutional
questions.
although
the
new
jersey
court
referred
to
its
state
constitution,
it
did
indicate
that
their
decision
was
based
upon
the
federal
constitution.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
moments
for
possible
rebuttal.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
yes,
it
does,
justice
powell.
the
mortgage
was
actually
prepared
by
edna
carpenter
who
worked
for
the
mennonite
board
of
missions.
it
was
not
prepared
by
an
attorney.
however,
with
respect
to
mr.
miller's
point
as
to
no
post
office
address
actually
being
on
the
mortgage
itself.
i
submit
that
there
was
no
difficulty
for
mr.
adams
in
this
case
to
send
the
elkhart
county
sheriff
directly
to
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
offices,
which
were
located
for
over
50
years
in
elkhart.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
yes,
it
is.
yes,
it
is,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
the
sheriff
has
an
office
in
goshen
and
in
elkhart.
and
the
county...
the
county
recorder's...
well,
some
of
the
records
are
in
elkhart
and
in
goshen,
both.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
elkhart's
about
42
thousand,
goshen
is
about
15,
20
thousand.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
yes.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
it
was
my
understanding
that
she
continued
to
pay
everything
and
unbeknownst
to
the
mennonite
board
of
missions,
she
did
not
pay
the
taxes
right
after
the
period
of
time
to
redeem
the
property
expired.
she
was
asked
to
leave
the
property
and
she
went
to
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
and
informed
them
that
she
was
in
trouble.
the
first
time
that
they
learned
there
was
problem
was
from
her
at
that
time.
with
respect
to
a
question
that
was
asked
by
mr.
stevens,
justice
stevens.
in
this
case,
the
only
interest
of
the
state
is
for
the
collection
and
payment
of
taxes
and
that
if
mailed
notice
was
sent
to
mortgagees
that
would
actually
further
the
states
interest
of
collecting
taxes.
in
the
brief,
i
cite
an
indiana
case
where
the
mortgagor
and
there
were...
the
mortgagor
and
the
mortgagee,
one
or
the
other...
their
property
was
listed
for
sale
for
delinquent
taxes
and
the
county
auditor
mailed
notice
to...
after
the
tax
sale,
mailed
notice
to
the
mortgagee,
informed
them
that
the
property
had
been
sold
for
delinquent
taxes.
the
mortgagee
promptly
paid
the
tax
and,
in
investigating
what
happened
as
far
as
why
the
taxes
hadn't
been
paid,
learned
that
the
property
taxes...
the
payment
had
not
gone
onto
a
computer
list
and
had
it
gone
onto
the
computer
list,
it
would
have
never
made
the
tax
sales
in
the
first
place.
so
the
mailing
of
notice
would
actually
assist
the
state
in
notifying
mortgagees
who
are
likely
to
pay
the
taxes
and
in
all
likelihood
would
pay
the
taxes.
and
it
would
further
the
state's
interest
of
collecting
the
taxes
as
soon
as
possible
and
in
a
fast
and
expeditious
manner.
mr.
william
j.
cohen
mullane
says,
justice
o'connor,
if
the
name
is
a
matter
of
public
knowledge
or
if
easily
ascertainable.
