mr.
cohen,
is
there
any
provision
of
indiana
law
that
assures
that
by
inspecting
the
record
of
the
mortgage,
the
place
at
which
it
has
been
recorded,
whichever,
a
person
would
be
able
to
apprise
themselves
of
the
present
address
of
the
mortgagee
as
well
as
the
name
of
the
mortgagee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
advocating
a
principle
of
request,
sending
mailed
notice
to
any
mortgagee
of
records,
i
take
it.
now
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
if
there
might
not
be
situations
in
which
there
hasn't
been
a
recorded
mortgage...
where
the
present
address
of
the
mortgagee
was
not
available
from
the
recording
data.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but--
--the
question--
--what
if
the
mortgage
had
been
recorded,
but
the
mortgage
either
didn't
show
the
mortgagee's
address
or
the
mortgagee
had
moved.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
he
be
entitled
to
treat
the
mortgage...
the
address
shown
on
the
mortgage
as
the
last
known
address
even
if
it
turned
out,
in
fact,
to
be
the
third
last
known
address?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
isn't
simply
a
question
of
having
to
pay
a
penalty
plus
the
amount
the
tax
sale
purchaser
paid
by
the
time
your
client
had
notice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
long
was
the
redemption
period?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean,
that
for
two
years
this
property
had
been
sold
for
taxes
and
your
client
had
a
mortgage
on
it,
but
had
no
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
it
had
been
sold
for
taxes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
most
mortgagees
in
the
agreement
between
the
mortgagor
and
the
mortgagee
have
an
agreement
whereby
the
mortgagor
has
to
pay
taxes,
and
the
mortgagee
his
some
overseeing
by
virtue
of
an
escrow
fund,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
do
you
think
that's
really
the
basis
for
a
constitutional
argument?
to
say
that
you
trusted
someone
to
do
it
and,
therefore,
you're
not
bound
by
any
constructive
service
or
third
party
notice
statutes
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
that
in
the
joint
appendix?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
find
that
it
appears
to
be
some
sort
of
a
brief
on
page
45...
is
it
this
tan--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
your...
this
seems
to
be
a
section
of
arguments.
could
you
check
your
own
page
45
and--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
think...
at
least
some
of
us
up
here
don't
seem
to
have
the
same
numbering
or
perhaps
the
same
document.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
the
tax
collector
had
gone
to
this
particular
mortgage
but
gone
no
further,
they
really...
he
really
would
have
had
no
mailing
address
by
which
to
mail?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
they
got
around
to
determining
it
if
it's
a
new
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
they
got
around
to
determining
it
in
elkhart
county,
if
it's...
or
you
just
don't
know.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
county
seat
is
in
goshen,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
is
it
from...
and
is
the
sheriff
in
goshen?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the...
what's
the
population
of
goshen
and
of
elkhart,
roughly?
