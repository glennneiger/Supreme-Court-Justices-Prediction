mr.
robert
w.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
the
beginning
point
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
is
a
property
right.
and
we
concede
that
the
mennonite
board
of
missions'
interest
in
this
real
estate
is
a
"property
right".
but
i
think
the
first
place
to
begin
is
that
the
court
should
understand
and
determine
under
indiana
law
that
a
mortgagee
is
not
an
owner
of
any
property.
the
furnish
case
which
is
a
case
in
indiana
where
the
supreme
court
reiterated
the
decision
that
it
made
in
mennonite
board
versus
adams,
i
quote,
"that
a
mortgagee
is
not
an
owner
as
well
established
by
indiana
law,
and
further,
a
mortgagee
has
not
title
to
the
land
mortgaged.
"
now
that
is
mentioned
because,
in
a
due
process
question
as
such
as
is
before
the
court,
court...
case
law
indicates
that
there
is
a
balancing
test.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
the
question
wouldn't
be
any
different?
i
don't
know.
i
only
know
in
indiana
there
is
no
interest
in
real
estate.
arizona,
the
last
case,
as
i
call
it,
is
the
only
case,
i
submit,
at
least
that
i
can
find,
that
has
answered
the
question
as
to
whether
a
mortgagee
requires
notice
by
mail
in
the
50
jurisdictions,
excluding
puerto
rico
and
others.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
well,
let
me--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--let
me
answer
it
this
way.
i'll
get
to
that
and
some
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
earlier.
the
question
is,
is
a
mortgage
a
significant
property
interest?
one
thing
the
court
should
note
for
the
balancing
test
that
comes
next
is
that
in
indiana
it's
no...
it's
not
one
of
the
bundle
of
sticks
that
i
learned
about.
it's
a
lien.
now
within...
balance
the
interests
of--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--well,
my
reading
indicates
that
whether
it
is
an
interest
in
real
estate
or
a
"property
right"
as
used
in
the
constitution
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
this
court
has
many
times
said
a
property
right
is
something
that's
not
real
property.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
it
is.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
i
don't
think
i
understand
the
question.
in
indiana
a
mortgagee
has
no
interest
in
real
property.
it
does
not
have
legal
interest,
equitable
interest,
none
of
the
bundle
of
sticks.
what
it
has
is
a
"property
right"
to
have
a
lien
on
a
piece
of
property
that
at
a
future
date
it
may
be
able
to
sell
to
satisfy
an
obligation.
if
this
court
would
determine
that
it's
not
a
significant
interest
in
property,
it
would
be
a
finding
of...
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the...
if
the
court
determines
that
it
is
a
property
right,
the
next
question
is,
we
have
to
balance
the
interests.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
oh,
no.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
anticipating
the
question,
i
believe
it
is.
i
concede
it's
a
property
right.
my
brief
concedes
that
it's
a
property
right.
i
wanted
the
court
to
know
that
it's
not
an
interest
in
real
property
because
that
comes
to
play
in
the
balancing
test
as
between
the
interests
of
the
state
and
the
interests
of
the
mortgage
company.
i
think
if
a
person
is
an
owner
there's
a
greater
interest
in
the
balancing
as
between
the
state's
interests
and
the
owner
of
the
real
estate.
a
legal
or
equitable
owner.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
yes.
now--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--each
has
a
lien.
now,
in
some
states,
it
may
be
that
an
interest
in
a
mortgage
is
an
equitable
interest
in
the
real
estate.
i
want
the
court
to
know
that
in
indiana
it
is
not.
the
second
question,
and
i
think
my
opponent
didn't
make
it
clear...
my
research
indicates
that
this
court
has
never
determined
that
notice
by
publication
is
not
constitutionally
sufficient
for
an
owner
of
real
estate
sold
at
a
tax
sale
or
a
tax
deed.
there
are
extremely
good
reasons
as
to
why
notice
by
publication
is
or
would
be
sufficient.
there
is
only
one
state,
and
that
is
arizona,
that
i
can
find
that
indicates
that
notice
by
mail
is
required
to
a
mortgage
holder
or
a
lien
holder,
and
that
is,
laz.
the
law
review
article
that
was
mentioned
as
84
yale
law
journal
indicated
at
the
time
of
the
writing
there
were
21
states
whose
statutes
say
that
notice
by
publication
to
the
owner
of
the
real
estate
is
constitutionally
sufficient.
in
my
research,
it
indicates
that
33
states
indicate
that
notice
to
a
mortgage
holder
is
only
done
by
publication.
of
the
other
states,
33,
just
publication,
to
a
mortgage
holder.
and
i
must
say
to
the
court,
i've
given
the
benefit
of
the
doubts,
and
some
of
them
are
very
confusing.
new
york,
for
example,
i
understand
reading
it,
has
an
alternate
method.
they
can
either
go
publication
or
they
can
go
actual
notice
to
the
owner.
texas,
i
don't
understand
at
all.
i've
put
that
in
one
of
the
other
states.
now
the
question
has
never
been
briefed
or
argued
before
this
court,
whether
notice
by
publication
to
divest
a
land
owner
of
his
interests
in
real
estate
if
he
doesn't
pay
his
taxes,
has
never
been
decided.
the...
and
there
are
courts
who
have
decided
that
it
is
permissible
to
give
notice
mere...
by
mere
publication
to
divest
a
land
owner
of
his
interests
in
real
estate
by
not
paying
his
taxes,
that's
coleman
v.
sheeve.
and
that's
the
district
court
of...
it's
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
1976.
in
the
township
of
montville...
that's
an
arizona...
excuse
me,
a
new
jersey
case,
four
to
three
determined
that
notice
by
publication
is
insufficient
constitutionally
under
the
the
mullane
test.
the
dissent
in
that
case
cited
a
number
of
reasons
why,
as
to
owners,
that
notice
by
publication
would
be
sufficient.
he
mentions
that
real
estate
taxes
are
a
life
blood
of
municipal
government.
and
it...
the
case
is
an
extremely
good
case,
and
the
judge
at
the
end
of
that
indicates
that
realizing
the
due
process
notice
requirement
he
would
follow
mullane
in
all
cases
where
there
is
a
significant
interest
of
property
and
he
would
carve
out
an
exception
for
taxes.
people,
owners
know
they're
due.
it's
a
just
system.
there's
notice.
everyone
knows.
but
i'm
not
here
to
argue
that
today.
we've
skipped...
i
called
that
the
missing
link...
we've
skipped
that.
this
court
has
never
heard,
as
far
as
i
know,
the
argument...
at
least
made
a
decision,
i
understand
they
may
have
heard
the
argument,
but
they've
never
made
that...
rendered
that
opinion.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
well--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--the
answer
to
that
is
yes
and
no.
the
practical
answer
is,
i
think,
a
state
is
interested
in
getting
the
money.
the
state
is
also
interested
in
doing
it
as
cheaply
and
as
efficiently
as
possible.
i
can,
unfortunately...
you
see,
i
believe
that
the
state
should
give
notice
to
owners
by
mail.
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
i've
read
cases
that
frankly
the
other
side
has
some
arguments.
the
only
good
one
i
could
find
is
in
the
dissent
in
the
montville...
montville,
new
jersey
case,
where
the
judge
just
says
it's
a
just
concept
that
you
own
it,
you
know
you're
supposed
to
pay
the
taxes.
the
length
of
time
in
new
jersey
was
four
years.
and
after
four
years,
you
don't
pay
your
taxes,
you're
putting
a
burden
on
the
other
taxpayers.
the
state's
not
getting
your
money
like
it
should.
if
you
don't
pay
it,
you
ought
to
know
it,
with
exceptions,
unless
you're
incompetent
or
something
else.
and
it
is
just
fair.
and
why
should...
notice
to
owners?
well,
that's
the
next
question.
is
it
notice
to
all
those
that
have
an
interest
in
the
property?
the
laz
case
in
arizona...
their
decision
was
based
upon
a
statute
that
says
you
give
notice
to
persons
with
an
interest
in
the
lot.
and
the
supreme
court
in
arizona
decided,
well,
an
interest
means
not
only
the
owner
but
the
mortgage
lien
holders,
judgement
lien
holders,
lists
pendents
notice.
in
the
arizona
dissent,
they
found
in
arizona
that
that
could
cause
a
lot
of
problems.
does
the
elkhart
county
recorder
or
any
recorder
drive
to
the
county
seat,
drive
to
the
courthouse
and
check
the
judgment
dockets
for
judgment
liens?
a
person
who
doesn't
pay
his
mortgage,
one
would
think,
doesn't
pay
his
bills.
one
would
think
he'd
get
sued.
one
would
think
would
have
judgments
against
him.
one
would
think
those
are
liens
on
the
real
estate,
so
the
possible
work
for
mortgage
companies
and
i
don't
want
to...
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
issue
of
the
mortgage,
the
lien
holder.
to
the
owner
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
it's
easy.
there
are...
and
i'm
not
really
here
to
argue...
owners.
there
are
some
reasonable
reasons
why
it
shouldn't
be
necessary.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
yes,
there
is.
and
i
think
it's
happening,
and
i
think
there
is
that
possibility.
and
i
guess
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
better
protect
yourself
and
you
better
draw
up
the
instrument
or
you
have
the
attorney
or
yourself
draw
it
up
to
protect
yourself.
but
to
have
trust
in
the
person
that
is
going
to
do
it,
to
ignore
the
payment
of
taxes
for
five
years,
i
don't
know
if
that's
constitutionally
protected
or
should
be.
i
think
the
issue
is...
is
that
was
this
notice
reasonably
calculated,
mullane
test,
if
we
get
that
far.
but...
and
i
think
we
have
to...
was
it
reasonably
the
notice,
reasonably
calculated
under
all
the
circumstances
to
apprise
a
lien
holder
of
what
action
was
going
to
be
taken
in
giving
that
lien
holder
an
opportunity
to
object,
and
in
this
case
opportunity
to
pay
the
taxes
if
it
chose.
now,
i
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
said
it
quite
well.
and
that
is,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
the
adams
case,
had
its
reasons
in
terms
of
was
it
reasonably
calculated.
it
says
it
is
understandable
while
actual...
why
actual
notice
has
not
been
extended
to
mortgagees.
most
mortgagees
are
in
the
business
of
lending
money
and
as
professional
money
lenders,
prudence
requires
them
to
be
aware
of
the
conditions
involving
their
collateral.
they
can
be
expected
to
protect
their
interests
by
keeping
records
of
the
mortgagor's
discharge
of
his
obligations.
in
a
footnote
it
goes
on
to
say
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
may
not
be
a
professional
money
lender
but
it
freely
chose
to
enter
an
area
of
sophisticated
financial
investment
and
thereby
necessarily
chose
to
incur
the
risk
inherent
therein.
and
i
agree
with
that.
i
also
point
out
in
texaco
inc.
v.
short,
an
indiana
case
that
was
decided
last
year,
the
dissent
in
that
case,
by
justice
brenner
at
page
801,
in
a
lawyers'
edition.
court...
"the
court",
that
is
the
majority,
"would
appear
to
treat
property
owners
as
businessmen
of
whom
we
do
indeed
expect
the
greatest
attentiveness
to
regulatory
obligations
in
the
conduct
of
their
business
affairs.
"
the
board...
and
i
take
umbrage
at
some
of
the
things
that,
a,
do
not
appear
in
the
record,
but
elkhart
county's
population
of
150
thousand
people...
i
honestly
didn't
know
where
to
get
a
hold
of
the
mennonite
board
of
missions.
i
think
that's
all
irrelevant.
it
is
not
in
the
record.
they
chose
to
do
it.
they
held
the
mortgage.
it
wasn't
a
free
mortgage.
it
was
seven
percent.
as
i
recall
it
was
in
'73.
i
think
that
was
a
reasonably
marketable
mortgage
in
'73.
it
may
have
been
under
the
market
slightly.
it
was
an
arm-length...
arms-length
transaction.
she
was
a
woman,
i
think.
i've
never
met
the
individual.
and
she
was
paying
her
mortgage.
why
she
stopped,
i
don't
know.
but
we
publish...
or
the
state
published
notice
to
a...
to
the
people
that
held
the
mortgages.
and
as
it
was
stated
in
mathews
v.
eldridge,
the
social
security
disability
case,
decided
in
this
court
in
1971,
talking
about
due
process
and
notice,
and
it
says
all
that
is
necessary
is
that
the
procedures
be
tailored
in
light
of
the
decision
to
be
made
to
the
capacities
and
circumstances
of
those
who
are
to
be
heard.
now
the
question
is
would
a
letter
have
done
it
better.
in
this
case,
no,
which
i'll
bring
out
in
a
moment.
but
notice
by
publication,
i
think
the
chief
justice
indicated
that
most
institutions
have
employees,
people.
i
think
that's
the
nelson
v.
the
city
of
new
york,
decided
in
1956,
in
this
case.
and
that's
where
the
notice
of
a
tax
sale
to
the
owner
went
to
the
bookkeeper.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
well,
i...
can
agree
with
that.
in
part
i
do.
i
do.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
well,
in
part
i
do,
because
it's
obviously
true
in
part,
but
two
answers:
one,
i
think
the
question
before
the
court
is,
what's
the
constitutionally
necessary
minimum;
and,
two,
in
mullane--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--no,
i
think--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--no--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--no...
no,
because
in--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--no,
and
i
don't
rest
my
argument
on
the
fact
that
they
would
take
care
of
themselves.
i'm
saying
to
the
court
that
there
was
in
fact
notice.
there
was
notice
by
publication.
the
question
you
have
to
ask
yourself--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--it
was
not
actual.
the
question
is--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--it's
one
of
the
reasons.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
right.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
it
does,
and
i--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--well
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
that
is
not
so...
at
least...
in
my
experiences,
is
the
banks
always
check
and
have
people...
or
at
savings
and
loans...
they
always
check
and
have
people
to
check
those.
because
at
times
computers
make
mistakes,
people
make
mistakes.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
i
submit
that
notice
by
publication
is
notice
to
the
people
in
that
county
to
protect
themselves.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
in
a...
where
the
post
office
name
and
address
of
the
mortgagee
is
in
the
system
yes,
it
would
be.
now
it
depends,
justice,
on
each
system.
the
elkhart
county
auditor...
there's
the
elkhart
county
recorder.
those
are
not
necessarily
the
same
office,
but...
which
i
think
is
irrelevant.
but
one
of
the
problems,
also,
is
how
does
the
court
define
mortgagee?
is
that
lien
holder,
which
can
cover
a
number
of
problem
areas
with
counties
and
states
notifying
all
lien
holders.
but
the
question
that
the
court,
i
believe
one
of
them,
has
to
decide
is
wasn't
notice
by
publication
reasonably
calculated
under
the
circumstances...
the
circumstances,
i
allege,
as
a
mortgage
company
who
chose
to
enter
into
a
field
of
giving
a
mortgage
and
making
a
profit
if
not
on
the
books
but
still
a
seven
percent
interest
on
the
money
as
a...
balancing
it
with
the
interests
of
the
state.
the
fact
that
they
decided
to
enter
into
this
field
and
even...
in
this
case,
even
if
the
court
would
determine
that
it's
not
reasonably
calculated
without
hearing
the
arguments
as
to
maybe
why
notice
to
publication
to
owners
is
all
that
is
necessary.
i
would
point
out...
this
is
the,
i
believe,
the
most
important
argument
i
can
make
here
under
mullane.
the
brief
of
my
appellant,
at
page
27,
has
a
footnote
that
indicates
as
follows:
indiana
code
32-821
"requires
the
name
and
addresses
of
the
mortgagee
be
on
their
recorded
mortgage.
"
that
is
not
quite
right.
that
statute
validates
mortgages
if
they
do
not
have
the
"full
name
and
post
office
address
of
the
mortgagee
as
required
by
other
older
indiana
law.
"
"and
i
quote,
full
name
and
post
office
address.
"
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case
at
page
45
has
the
address
of
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
as
follows,
mennonite
board
of
missions,
a
corporation
of
wayne
county
in
the
state
of
ohio.
that
is
not
a
post
office
address.
that
is
not
a
mailing
address.
and
i
submit--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--page
45,
where
the
mortgage
of
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
is
set
out.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
yes,
the
tan
joint
appendix.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
page
45.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
i
have
mortgage
and--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--i
can
only
tell
you
that
i
got
my
joint
appendix
from
the
other
counsel.
his
page
now
says
67--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--his
page
is
67.
i
don't
know
why
mine
is
45.
he
gave
me
the
joint
appendix.
page
67,
the
court
will
find...
i'll
read
from
the
actual
mortgage,
"the
address,
mennonite
board
of
missions
a
corporation,
of
wayne
county,
in
the
state
of
ohio.
"
there
is
no
other
address
in
this
record
or
in
that
auditor's
office
or
in
that
recorder's
office
of
any
other
address
other
than
mennonite
board
of
missions
of
wayne
county,
state
of
ohio.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
correct.
unless
he
either
was
a
mennonite
and
happened
to
belong
to
that
church
and
knew
what
the
mennonite
board
of
missions
is.
that
is
something,
it
is
not
the
mennonite
church.
and
if
he
knew
that
that
organization
that
may
be
in
elkhart
county
is
not...
is
the
same
organization
that
is
in
ohio.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
this
would
be
an
alternate
ground
to
affirm
under
mullane.
mullane
is...
all
it
says
is
clear
as
a
bell
to
the
beneficiaries,
if
post
office
names
and
addresses
weren't
there,
they
don't
have
to
do
it.
mullane
says,
"where
the
names
and
post
office
addresses
of
those
affected
by
the
proceedings
are
at
hand
the
reason
disappears.
"
in
the
mullane
case,
the
trustee
had
on
its
books
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
income
beneficiaries.
i
agree
that
if
these
are
all
the
same
people,
and
if
we
wanted
to
go
outside
the
normal
course
of
the
auditor
and/or
the
recorder,
that
we
could
have
gotten
a
letter
to
them.
a
letter
to
wayne
county,
ohio
was
not
going
to
get
to
the
mennonite
board
of
missions.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
because
i
did,
but
that's--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--well
for
two
reasons.
one,
it's
my
understanding
of
the
postal
regulations
that
mail
will
only
be
addressed...
delivered
to
a
postal
address,
either
a
box
or
an
address,
and
secondly,
from
personal
knowledge
that
i
don't
think
has
any
business
in
this
case.
the
question
of
names
and
post
office
address
is
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
presumably
that's
the
wrong
place.
i
notice
the
address
of
this
court
is
simply
the
supreme
court,
washington,
d.c.,
with
the
zip.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
well,
back
to
the
point.
my--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--no,
it
determined
that
notice
by
publication--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--it
wasn't...
notice
by
publication
is
necessary.
notice
by
mail
is
not.
their
ground
was
it
was
reasonably
calculated
because
they
entered
into
a
sophisticated
area
of
financing.
they're
on
notice.
the
notice
is
supposed
to
be...
depending
on
if
it
was
a
person
on
welfare,
that's
one
thing.
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
businessman.
they
chose
to
enter
into
the
field.
those
are
all
the
reasons.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
no,
it
does
not,
either.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
i
take
umbrage
with
my
opponent.
i
don't
know
why
they
changed
it
but
what
they
did
is
add
a
provision
and
that
provision
says
that
if
the
mortgagee
will
pay
up
to
ten
dollars,
two
to
the
auditor,
and
provide
his
name
and
post
office
address,
that
when
the
auditor
sends
out
those
little
notices
that
your
taxes...
your
property
is
about
to
be
sold
for
taxes,
he'll
send
one
to
the
lien
holder
also.
but
the
lien
holder
has
the
affirmative
duty
under
the
statute
to
provide
that
name
and
address
to
the
auditor.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
up
to.
that's
the
statute.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
it's
a
very
cheap
state.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
oh,
yes,
the
mortgagee
has
to
pay--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--no.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
no.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
no.
when...
see,
the
mortgagee...
and
again,
the
cases
that...
or
the
footnote
that
i
referred
to
in
the
brief
mentions
indiana
case
law.
the
procedure
in
indiana
is
this.
a
mortgagee
takes
his
mortgage
to
the
recorder's
office
and
records
it
for
public
record.
the
statute
now
says
that
if
he
wants
to
receive
notices
that
the
taxes
are
delinquent
and
that
there's
about
to
be
a
sale,
he
must
go
to
the
auditor
and
pay
a
fee.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
right
then.
and
notify
the
auditor
of
his
name
and
address
and
pay
whatever...
the
statute
says
the
auditor
can
set
a
fee,
the
county
auditor
can
set
a
fee,
but
not
more
than
ten
dollars.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
and
he
provides
the
name
and
address,
his
name
and
address,
and
then,
if
the
taxes
are
not
paid
for
15
months
and
the
notice
goes
out
that
there's
going
to
be
a
sale,
the
auditor
is
required
to
send
not
only
a
certified
letter
to
the
owner--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--the
statute
in
my
memory
says...
the
state
statute
says
the
county
shall
determine
the
fee
to
be
charged
but
not
more
than--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--in
elkhart?
mr.
robert
w.
miller
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
w.
miller
i
have
no
idea.
i
hold
no
mortgages.
i've
never
had
the
opportunity
to
use
it.
that
statute
is
used
in
my
research
in
some
of
the...
some
of
the
other
states.
the
appellant
in
this
case
has
indicated
in
his
brief
and,
again
in
that
same
footnote,
that
the
law
of
the
state
of
indiana
is
that
a
deed
and
mortgage
is
taken
to
the
auditor.
the
law
in
the
state
in
indiana
is,
is
that
a
deed,
before
it
be
recorded,
is
taken
to
the
auditor
and
placed
on
there
are
the
words
to
be
entered
for
taxation,
or
words
to
that
effect.
the
auditor
writes
down
who
owns
the
property
and
their
address
and...
so
that
the
county
knows,
that
are
going
to
be
taxed.
as
to
mortgages,
the
statute
says
and
only
says,
that
before
the
auditor
makes
that
endorsement
on
the
deed,
he
may
require
a
tax
identification
number,
and
i
emphasize
may,
on
other
instruments
including
mortgages
that
divest
a
person
of
a
mortgage.
that
sounds
a
little
complicated,
but
indiana
has
a
law
that
if
you
have
a
mortgage
on
a
piece
of
property,
you
pay
less
property
taxes
because
you
have
that
mortgage.
there
is
no
requirement
to
take
the
mortgage
to
the
auditor's
office.
in
other
words,
there's
no
way
for
an
auditor
under
the
indiana
scheme
of
things
to
have
a
name
and
post
office
address.
but
in
this
case
there
was
no
post
office
address.
there
was
notice
that
was
reasonably
calculated
in
the
general
scheme
of
things
and
i
reasonably
submit
under
mullane,
even
if
the
court
felt
that
all
these
mortgage
holders
should
get
notice
that
mullane
and
all
of
the
cases
afterwards...
in
the
case
of
laz
versus
arizona,
they
made
a
point
that
laz
versus
arizona
requires
a
letter
to
a
mortgage
holder
that
the
taxes,
or
the
property's
going
to
be
sold,
or
it's
going
to
be
deeded.
but
even
in
laz,
it
says
that's
only
to
the
mortgage
or
the
lien
holders
whose
names
and
post
office
addresses
are
in
the
public
record
without
inquiry.
they're
open
and
available,
as
was
said
in
mullane.
this
court
held
in
mullane
that
the--
mr.
robert
w.
miller
--thank
you.
