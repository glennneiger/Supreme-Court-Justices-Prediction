john
paul
stevens
mr.
simms,
who
wrote
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
are
some
anonymous
author's
comments?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
find
it
kind
of
a
surprising
authority
if
you
don't
even
know
who
wrote
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
welborn,
doesn't
that
involve
a
change
in
the
theory
of
the
master?
as
i
read
the
report,
he
would
have
found
in
your
favor
even
if
you
assumed
some
harm
to
new
mexico,
because
of
the
fact
that
since
the
river
was
entirely
appropriated,
there
is
nothing
at
all
left
for
colorado,
and
as
a
sovereign
state
it
is
entitled
to
some
of
the
water.
that
is
the
master's
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
followed
that
rule,
you
don't
need
any
more
findings.
it
is
kind
of
a
legal--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
simms,
may
i
ask
you
on
that
point,
does
the
law
of
the
upstream
state
have
a
bearing
on
your
argument?
if
it
were
not,
if
the
law
of
colorado
were
not
appropriate,
the
same
general
kind
of
law
as
it
is
in
new
mexico,
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
say
they
had
the
same
law
as
they
have
in
the
eastern
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
are
you
willing
to
say
that
the
law
of
colorado
is
irrelevant
to
your
position,
simply
because--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--my
question
is,
what
if
it
were
different
in
colorado.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
your
argument
depends
entirely
on
future
use,
then
it
would
be
irrelevant.
if
it
depends
on
the
fact
that
they
are
both
appropriative
states,
then
it
is
significant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
your
position
that
if
two
states
are
in
dispute,
and
if
the
downstream
state
succeeds
in
appropriating
all
the
water
that
it
needs
before
the
upstream
state
appropriates
any
water,
the
upstream
state
can
never
get
any
water?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
the
interests.
suppose
it
was
an
international
boundary.
it
wouldn't
work
there,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
say
montana
appropriate
all
the
water
in
a
stream
that
originated
in
canada.
could
that
defeat
canadian
subsequent
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
right,
because
they
all
originate
in
the
same
source
of
law,
but
what
is
the
source
of
law
on
which
you
rely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
all
new
mexico
law,
is
it
not?
