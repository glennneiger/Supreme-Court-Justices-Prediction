justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
simms,
the
master
did
find
that
the
operation
of
that
district
was
inefficient,
didn't
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
he
also
found,
as
i
recall,
that
there
was
a
loss
of
about
33
percent
of
the
water.
and
by
loss
there,
did
he
mean
the
water
was
going
back
into
the
river
or
that
it
just
was
not
used
anywhere?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
which
case,
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
among
the
eight
that
have
addressed
generally
this
area,
discusses
the
efficiency
question
you
are
now
discussing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
which
supports
you?
which
of
those,
you
think?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question.
are
you
saying
that
if
there
was
no
evidence
of
waste,
no
evidence
that
new
mexico
was
not
exercising
appropriate
oversight
over
the
use
of
water,
and
assuming
that
colorado
never
used
any
at
all,
that
the
doctrine
of
equitable
apportionment
would
entitle
colorado
to
some,
anyway?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
the
master
in
this
case
also
said
it,
didn't
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
that,
if
i
understand
your
correctly,
if
a
state,
with
respect
to
an
interstate
river,
had
never
used
any
water
before
and
the
other
state
was
making
100
percent
use
of
it,
the
state
that
had
never
used
any
water
still
would
be
entitled
to
some.
